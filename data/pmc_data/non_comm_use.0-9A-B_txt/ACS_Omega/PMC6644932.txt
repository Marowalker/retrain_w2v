Yb3+/Er3+-codoped GdBiW2O9 phosphors are prepared
via the solid-state route for application
in upconversion temperature sensors. The structural analyses indicate
that all phosphors possess a single-phased orthorhombic structure.
Upon the excitation of a laser wavelength of 980 nm, Yb3+/Er3+-codoped GdBiW2O9 phosphors
emanate green emission peaks, endorsed to the emission to the 4I15/2 state from the 4S3/2 and 2H11/2 states, respectively, and the weak
emission (red) from the 4F9/2 state to the 4I15/2 state of Er3+ ion. The upconversion
mechanism has been elucidated via the scheme of energy levels conferred
from the pump power-induced upconversion characteristics. The temperature-dependent
upconversion of GdBiW2O9 phosphors was investigated
in detail along with the estimation of the stability and repeatability
of the measurement. The obtained sensitivity data for the present
materials with the corresponding sensing parameters show their probable
outlook in temperature sensing applications.

1 Introduction
With the advancement of
technology from macrodimension to micro-
and nanoelectronics, the temperature in reduced dimensionalities because
of the Joule heating effect becomes non-negligible and severe to degrade
the device performance.1−5 Therefore, the assessment of temperature in micro/nano aspects with
an elevated precision is an immense confrontation to avert these thermal
spikes.6−8 As the enormity and spot of these temperature spikes
mainly depend on the device design and the accuracy of the integrated
circuits, it is difficult to get the idea about the location of these
hotspots. Moreover, different physical properties including refractive
index and optical gain, which control the performance of the devices,
are strongly temperature-dependent and hence can influence their utility,
even leading to irretrievable smash up.9,10 This requires
thermometry at micro-/nanoscale for the electronic devices during
real operating conditions. However, the conventional thermometers,
based on the expansion of metal or liquid with temperature, are unfeasible
to be used in the micro-/nanoelectronic devices.4,11 Therefore,
the recent development of noninvasive thermometers including nanoscale
thermocouples, IR thermometers, and thermometers based on Raman spectroscopy,
which can be incorporated into different micro-/nanoelectronic devices
to provide the obligatory thermal information, has quickly become
a reality.12−17 In recent years, thermometers based on luminescence are extensively
used as noncontact thermometers, owing to their own advantages.

To date, several research works have been conceded on the temperature
sensors based on luminescence thermometry, that is, the association
between temperature and luminescence characteristics to accomplish
thermal sensing.18−22 However, there exist two different approaches to quantify the temperature
sensing performance of luminescent materials,23,24 including the measurement of fluorescent intensity ratio (FIR) and
the decay time. On the basis of these approaches, various quantum
dot materials, organic materials, pigments and dyes, and rare-earth
ions were used to develop luminescent thermometers. Recently, FIR-based
temperature sensors of the Er3+/Yb3+-doped luminescent
materials, which exhibit efficient upconversion (UC) green emissions
to the 4I15/2 state from the 4S3/2 and 2H11/2 states, draw a lot of
research attention.25−27 Various research works are available with Er3+/Yb3+-codoped materials for the thermal sensing
properties with different hosts such as glass materials and phosphor
materials. Yi et al.25 reported the influence
of Er3+/Yb3+ codoping of the NaYF4 host matrix for temperature sensing applications. Dong et al.28 reported the efficient temperature sensitivity
of the CaF2 host. All these researches obtained efficient
temperature sensing with relative thermal sensitivity in the range
of 1–2.1% K–1. However, the temperature range
for this temperature sensing was as low as 293–318 K. Liao
et al.29 developed Gd2TiO5 phosphors for thermometry applications and obtained maximum
sensitivities as 40.76 × 10–4 K–1 at 565 K. Y2WO6 crystals were synthesized
by the hydrothermal method for thermometry applications by Chen et
al.30 Other researchers reported the relative
temperature sensitivity of the phosphor materials doped with rare-earth
ions as 2–3% K–1 (333–375 K), and
to date, the utmost relative sensitivity was obtained as 5.53% K–1.28,31,32 Some recent researches by the author’s group on different
glass materials and oxide-based phosphors for temperature sensing
applications were reported, and the optimum relative sensitivity was
observed as 2.22% K–1 in the temperature range 300–550
K.33 Though the temperature range of operation
is elevated, still the relative sensitivity requires a large modification.
Therefore, the present research work aims to develop new Er3+/Yb3+-based luminescent materials for temperature sensor
applications.

Recently, tungstate materials have fascinated
huge curiosity for
luminescence applications because of the strong and broad absorption
band of the W–O bond and its chemical and thermal stability.34−36 Owing to this, the tungstate materials including CdWO4, CaWO4, and KGd(WO4)2 can be used
for various applications in the fields of scintillators, phosphors,
and laser materials.37−39 However, there is a lack of proper research work
reported on the luminescent thermometric characteristics of tungstate-based
phosphors. Therefore, in this paper, a new Er3+/Yb3+-codoped phosphor based on the GdBiW2O9 host was successfully developed via a solid-state approach, and
the structure and UC characteristics were investigated. The influence
of temperature on the UC characteristics was used to estimate the
sensing parameters, including sensitivity and resolution, for the
first time for this phosphor.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Material Preparation
The synthesis
of the novel GdBiW2O9:Er3+,Yb3+ phosphors was carried out by the well-known high-temperature
solid-state method using Er2O3, Yb2O3, Gd2O3, Bi2O3, and WO3 as the starting ingredients. The key ingredients
were grinded homogeneously using a mortar–pestle, and their
stoichiometric ratios were taken. The raw precursors were then transferred
to alumina crucibles and were heated in a furnace at 600 °C for
10 h. The samples were cooled to room temperature, grinded to fine
powder, and again sintered for 8 h at 900 °C.

2.2 Material Characterization
The X-ray
diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-prepared phosphors were recorded
by using an X-ray diffractometer (Ultima IV, Rigaku) with Cu Kα
radiation. The particle size distributions along with the morphologies
were explored by using a Hitachi S-800 scanning electron microscope.
A continuous-wave 980 nm diode laser was used to excite the phosphors,
and the UC spectra were evidenced with a PMT detector directly attached
to a monochromator. A heating attachment was linked to this instrument
with a temperature controller to measure the temperature-induced UC.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Phase
Identification, Structural Analysis,
and Morphology
A series of UC phosphors Gd1–xErxBiW2O9 (x = 0.005, 0.01, 0.015, 0.02, 0.025) were
synthesized, and to identify the phases of the prepared UC materials,
the XRD patterns of the as-prepared Gd1–xErxBiW2O9 were measured, which is shown in Figure 1. All the materials were obtained as single-phased
compounds that matched well with the isostructurally similar orthorhombic
EuBiW2O9,40 having
the ICSD database no. 183444.

Figure 1 (a) XRD patterns of Gd1–xErxBiW2O9 phosphors for
(a) x = 0.005, (b) x = 0.01, (c) x = 0.015, (d) x = 0.02, and (e) x = 0.025.

For a better analysis of the crystal structure of the synthesized
material, the Rietveld refinement was accomplished for Gd0.99Er0.01BiW2O9 by utilizing the crystallographic
data of the isotopic single-crystal structure of EuBiW2O9 (ICSD no. 183444) as an initial model with the help
of FullProf Suit software41 and is shown
in Figure 2. The reliability
factors of refinement were converged as Rp = 7.38% and Rwp = 9.58%, and it indicated
the quality of the refinement. From the XRD refinement, it was clear
that the crystal possessed an orthorhombic phase with the space group Pnma and lattice parameters: a = 31.802
Å, b = 5.594 Å, and c =
3.952 Å. The values of the results were smaller than those reported
for the polymorphic EuBiW2O9 of GdBiW2O9. It could be explained on the basis of the difference
in the ionic radius of Eu3+ (1.066 Å) and Gd3+ (1.053 Å). When Gd3+ ions are replaced by Eu3+, the volume of the unit cell becomes smaller and hence the
lattice parameters.42

All the refinement data
are used to draw the crystal structure
of the GdBiW2O9 phase using VESTA software,43 as shown in Figure 3. Figure 3a displays the crystal structure of Gd0.99Er0.01BiW2O9 based on the three-dimensional
network of alternating (BiO2)− and (Gd2W2O12)6– layers. These
two layers are connected by the chains of the WO6 octahedron,
which are linked in the corner.42 The Gd
atoms are coordinated by seven oxygen atoms, as shown in Figure 3b, and formed the
GdO7 polyhedra. These polyhedrons are attached to a chain
by edge-sharing O atoms. The W atoms are coordinated to five and six
oxygen atoms to form a trigonal bipyramidal WO5 and an
octahedrally coordinated WO6 polygon,respectively, as shown
in Figure 3b. Figure 3b also presents the
coordination of Bi atoms with six oxygen atoms to form a distorted
triangular prism as BiO6, and multiple BiO6 polygons
are interconnected into a (BiO2)− layer.42Figure 3c displays the unit cell of the GdBiW2O9 phase.

Figure 4 presents
the XRD data of the Yb-codoped Gd0.99Er0.01BiW2O9, with the Yb concentration varying as 5, 10,
15, 20, and 25 mol %. The XRD patterns were similar to the ISCD pattern
no. 183444 and represent a single phase, devoid of any unidentified
diffraction peaks from impurity, implying the easy incorporation of
Yb3+ in the framework of the Gd0.99Er0.01BiW2O9 phosphor. It was owing to the fact of
the similarities of the ionic radii of the host cation to that of
the doping cation.

and (e) y = 0.25.

the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the Er3+-ion-doped and Er3+-/Yb3+-ion-codoped GdBiW2O9 phosphors synthesized via the solid-state reaction
route. The distribution of particle size for both phosphors indicated
the presence of particles less than 1 μm with agglomerated morphology. Figure 5c displays the transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) image of the Er3+-/Yb3+-ion-codoped GdBiW2O9 phosphor, and the inset

Figure 5d displays
the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of the corresponding crystal.
In the HRTEM and diffraction patterns, the well-crystallized phosphors
are clearly visible, and the calculated interplanar spacing was obtained
as 0.32 nm. It corresponds to the lattice constants of the customary
GdBiW2O9 materials in the (111) plane.

Figure 6a shows
the thermogravimetric differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC) curves
of the Er3+-/Yb3+-ion-codoped GdBiW2O9 phosphors heat-treated in N2 atmosphere
up to 1000 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min. One band
at ∼80 °C in the DSC curve during the heating process
was clearly observed (Figure 6b), which can be attributed to the evaporation of water. For
the TG curve, there also existed one stage of weight loss of nearly
0.963% from 70 to 400 °C, owing to the evaporation of water.
Above 400 °C, the weight remained about the same. It indicated
the thermal stability of the Er3+-/Yb3+-ion-codoped
GdBiW2O9 phosphors.

3.2 Room-Temperature
UC and Energy-Level Diagram
The UC spectra of the GdBiW2O9:Er3+ phosphors excited via a 980
nm laser display several emission peaks
around 525, 545, and 655 nm, as presented in Figure 7a. The emission band in the green region
peaking at 525 nm (G1 band) and 545 nm (G2 band) is owing to the transition
to the 4I15/2 level from the 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 states of Er3+ ions, respectively, and the band in the red region peaking at 655
nm (R band) is due to the 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transition.44 With
an increasing Er3+ concentration, the UC intensity increased
upto 1 mol % and then decreased, owing to the self-concentration quenching.45Figure 7b shows the corresponding CIE coordinate, and it reveals the
invariance of the color coordinate with the Er3+ concentration.
When the Yb3+ ions are codoped in the optimized GdBiW2O9:Er3+ phosphors, the UC intensity
increased manifold, owing to the Yb3+ ion to Er3+ ion energy transfer. However, the G1 band enhanced about 70 times,
G2 band about 1.3 times, and R band enhanced about 60 times. The UC
intensity of the Er3+-/Yb3+-coactivated phosphor
was seen to increase with the Yb3+ concentration up to
the Er3+/Yb3+ ratio of 1/15 and then decreased,
as shown in Figure 7c. The increase in UC intensity pointed to the presence of more population
in the excited levels from the ground-state level. The population
might be increased because of the energy transfer from the Yb3+ to Er3+ ions. The decrease in UC intensity with
the increase in the Er3+/Yb3+ ratio over 1/15
could be explained with the concentration quenching phenomenon. The
corresponding CIE coordinates (Figure 7d) indicated that the color coordinate position remained
about the same with the variation of the Yb3+ concentration.
However, the reason behind the dissimilar variation of different emission
bands can be discussed on the basis of the energy-level scheme.

varying concentrations of Er3+ ions (x), (b) corresponding CIE coordinate diagram of Gd1–xErxBiW2O9 phosphors, (c) UC spectra of Gd0.99–yEr0.01YbyBiW2O9 phosphors vs the concentration (y)
of Yb3+ ion, and (d) corresponding CIE coordinate diagram
of Gd0.99–yEr0.01YbyBiW2O9 phosphors with
varying y.

To explicate the UC phenomena and the energy plot, the UC
emission
of the optimized GdBiW2O9:Er3+,Yb3+ phosphor was evidenced with the variation of pump power
(P), as viewed in Figure 8a. The corresponding CIE coordinate is shown
in Figure 8b.

of Gd0.84Er0.01Yb0.15BiW2O9 phosphors, varying the pump power of
the laser diode from 400 to 1330 mW, (b) corresponding CIE coordinate
diagram of Gd0.84Er0.01Yb0.15BiW2O9 phosphors, (c) logarithmic plot of pump power
with UC intensity of Gd0.84Er0.01Yb0.15BiW2O9 phosphors, and (d) energy-level diagram
of Er3+ and Yb3+ in the GdBiW2O9 host matrix.

It indicated that the pump power had a negligible effect
on the
CIE color coordinates. This was owing to the consistent doping and
successful energy transfer from Yb3+ to Er3+ in the host. It demonstrated the stability of UC emission from the
present host materials. The integral intensity (I) follows the relation I ∝ Pn, where n is the number
of incident photons involved in the present UC.46 From the logarithmic plot of integral UC intensity with
pump power, the n value can be calculated. Figure 8c displays the linear
variation for three UC emission bands, including G1, G2, and R. The n value for the G1 and G2 transitions were calculated as
1.97 and 2.27, and for the R emission band, it was estimated as 2.04.
These results exhibited the contribution of two-photon excitation
in the UC mechanism.47

Figure 8d displays
the schematic diagram of the energy-level scheme for the GdBiW2O9:Er3+/Yb3+ phosphor based
on the two-photon mechanism.47 Initially,
the electrons from the ground-state 4I15/2 in
the Er3+ ions were stimulated to the higher excited state 4I11/2, with the help of ground-state absorption.
It is accomplished via the Yb3+ to Er3+ ion
energy transfer. Then, the electrons were moved to the 4F7/2 level from the 4I11/2 state
via excited state absorption as well as via the energy transfer route.
Then, nonradiative relaxation to the lower levels of 4S3/2 and 2H11/2 occurred, which thereby
influenced the 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 (G1) and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 (G2) transitions. The probability of nonradiative
relaxation to the 4S3/2 and 2H11/2 levels secures the emission intensity of the G1 and G2
bands. However, the population of the 2H11/2 level increased more than that of the 4S3/2 level after the codoping of the Yb3+ ions, which results
in the higher variation of G1 band compared to the G2 band. Therefore,
a dissimilar variation of different emission bands was observed. The
electron which relaxed to the 4I13/2 level and
then stimulated to the 4F9/2 level can help
in the 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transition (R).

3.3 Luminescence Thermometry
and Temperature Sensing
To check the dependence of the temperature
on UC, a series of UC
spectra were recorded with the optimized GdBiW2O9:Er/Yb materials (Gd0.84Er0.01Yb0.15BiW2O9) as a temperature function and displayed
in Figure 9a. It is
observed that with an increase in temperature from 303 to 498 K (30–225
°C), the intensity of the G1 band and the G2 band changed in
opposite ways, whereas the peak positions remained unchanged. At room
temperature (303 K), the intensity of the G1 band corresponding to
the 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 transition was comparable to the G2 band intensity corresponding
to that of the 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transition. As the temperature increases, the luminescent
intensity of the G1 band at about 525 nm shows a gradual increase,
whereas the corresponding intensity of the G2 band first increases
and then slightly decreases. It is owing to the low transition rate
of 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 compared to 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 at high temperatures. The integral intensity of the phosphor
decreased because of the increased lattice vibration, and, therefore,
the upconverted green emission shows a small variation with a change
in temperature. The variation in color emission with temperature was
clearly observed in the CIE color coordinate diagram, as shown in Figure 9b. The integral intensity
ratio between the 525 and 545 nm transitions [(2H11/2 → 4I15/2)/(4S3/2 → 4I15/2)], generally known as fluorescence
intensity ratio (FIR), was also measured with different temperatures
and shown in Figure 9c. It is well-known that the 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 energy states are very close and separated
by a very low energy gap (699 cm–1), thus being
thermally coupled.

Figure 9 (a) UC spectra of Gd0.84Er0.01Yb0.15BiW2O9 phosphors, varying the temperature
from
303 to 498 K; (b) corresponding CIE coordinate diagrams of Gd0.84Er0.01Yb0.15BiW2O9 phosphors; (c) variation of the FIR value with temperature.
The blue line indicates the Boltzmann fitting, and (d) logarithmic
plot of the FIR value with the inverse of temperature for Gd0.84Er0.01Yb0.15BiW2O9 phosphors.

Therefore, the electron population
on these levels can be governed
by Boltzmann’s distribution. However, with the rise in temperature,
the population of the 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 levels changes in a different manner because of which
the intensity ratio of FIR transitions might vary. The variation of
this ratio is generally described as per the Boltzmann formula. It
is in complete agreement with the present results. The variation of
FIR shows a gradual increase with temperature, following the Boltzmann
behavior according to the equation48 1  where B is a constant factor
(pre-exponential), ΔE is the energy gap involving
the two levels, T is the temperature (K), and k is the Boltzmann constant.

It can be understood
from this equation that FIR is only temperature-dependent,
therefore making the phosphor a suitable material for temperature
sensing applications. The plot of FIR with the inverse of temperature
(Figure 9d) gives a
near-linear curve, thus verifying the phosphor’s suitability
in the temperature sensing field.

The slope of the linear plot
was obtained as −1091.71 K
and further used for the calculation of the ΔE value. It was obtained as 752 cm–1, which was
close to the energy gap sandwiched between the 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 levels, as observed from the emission
energy-level diagram in the present case.

To know more about
the sensing ability of the GdBiW2O9:Er,Yb phosphor,
the temperature-induced variation of
the rate of FIR (R)3,4 2  

In the present case,
it was estimated to be 0.0107 K–1. This value was
seen to increase to 0.0174 K–1, with an increase
in temperature up to 450 K, and then decreased.

The variation
of sensitivity with temperature is shown in Figure 10a. Various researches
were reported on luminescence-based thermometry, and Table 1 summarizes the results with
the present research. These comparisons indicate the suitability of
the present phosphor for temperature sensing applications. The sensitivity
value is used further to estimate the relative sensor sensitivity
via the normalization of the temperature-dependent sensitivity as
follows3 3

Gd0.84Er0.01Yb0.15BiW2O9 phosphors.

The
variation of relative sensitivity with temperature is shown
in Figure 10b.

The reproducibility and stability of the sensors are the indispensable
parts of sensitivity estimation.49 The
variations of the FIR value with the increase in temperature from
300 to 500 K and the corresponding decrease in temperature from 550
to 300 K for the consecutive two cycles are shown in Figure 11a.

present estimation.

An insignificant hysteresis
behavior was found in the present case.
It indicated an exceptional reversible character of the present phosphor.
The FIR values were also recorded at 303, 398, and 498 K incessantly
for the 120 min cycle test with 20 min intervals. During this time,
the sample position was kept undisturbed.

The FIR value remained
about the same throughout the 2 h experiment
time and is shown in Figure 11b. These two characteristics also vouch for the use of the
present phosphor as a suitable material for practical appliances.

4 Conclusions
In summary, GdBiW2O9 phosphors doped with
Er3+ ions and Er3+/Yb3+ ions were
synthesized by the solid-state method. The structural refinement analysis
indicated that the phosphors crystallized in an orthorhombic crystal
system and the doping/codoping of RE ions keep the crystal structure
unchanged. Using the laser excitation of 980 nm, the Er3+ phosphor exhibited strong green UC emissions from the 2H11/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transitions of Er3+ ions, respectively,
which were enhanced manifold after the codoping of Yb3+, and the explanation was given on the basis of the energy exchange
mechanism between the Er3+ and Yb3+ ions. The
contribution of two-photon absorption was verified from the power
dependence studies. The near-linear curve obtained from the logarithmic
plot of the FIR as a function of temperature inverse establishes a
possibility of the usability of the phosphors for temperature sensing
applications. The phosphor sensitivity was estimated to be 0.0107
K–1, which increased with increasing temperature.
An insignificant hysteresis behavior was found for the variations
in FIR value with the increase in temperature from 300 to 500 K and
the corresponding decrease in temperature from 550 to 300 K for the
consecutive two cycles. It indicated an exceptional reversible character
of the present phosphor. The recorded FIR values at 303, 398, and
498 K incessantly for the 120 min cycle test with 20 min intervals
remained about the same throughout the 2 h experiment time, indicating
a good stability of the present materials. The high sensor response
over a broad range of temperature with great temperature resolution,
good reproducibility, and stability of the phosphor sensors indicate
the suitability of the GdBiW2O9:Er3+,Yb3+ phosphors for temperature sensing applications.
