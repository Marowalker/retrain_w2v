Positional
isomers of zinc–nitrobenzoate complexes possessing
pyridine -3-(or-4-) carboxamide are used for a comparative theoretical
and experimental study to understand their utility as model complexes
to understand the role of metal-to-ligand charge transfer in aggregation-induced
emission (AIE). Among the five different model zinc complexes, four
of them are non-ionic, and one is an ionic complex. The frontier molecular
energy levels of different combinations of the positional isomeric
complexes and the absorption maximum were ascertained by density functional
theory calculations. The PolyQ value obtained from solid samples of
each complex is different. Shifts in the emissions to higher wavelengths
than the expected emission for the S1 to S0 transition
were observed due to aggregations. The highest value of PolyQ among
the complexes was 13.56% observed for emission at 439 nm (λex = 350) of the non-ionic complex, namely, (di-aqua)bis(pyridine-3-carboxamide)di(2-nitrobenzoato)zinc(II)
monohydrate. Close resemblance in emission lifetime decay profiles
of the solid samples of those complexes and the respective solutions
of those complexes in dimethyl sulfoxide with or without water showed
a common trend, suggesting aggregation-induced emission in each case.
Aggregation-induced emission caused by adding water in dimethyl sulfoxide
solution of each complex showed an initial increase without a shift
in the emission wavelength followed by a quenching with a shift of
the respective emission peak to a short wavelength. Dynamic light
scattering studies showed an increase in the average particle sizes
upon an increase in the concentration of water. This indicated initial
participation of water molecules to form aggregates with the complexes,
favoring an increase in the AIE intensity. Aggregation of each complex
changes with the concentration of water, and an increase in the concentration
of water beyond a characteristic limit causes lowering of the emission
intensity to the short wavelength.

Introduction
The self-assembly of
various zinc complexes shows novel emission
properties.1−8 Many zinc complexes have prospects as applied optoelectronic materials.9−11 Besides enhanced chemical reactivity for catalytic reactions,12−18 optoelectronic properties of zinc oxide necessitate the study of
polynuclear zinc clusters possessing a ZnO4 environment.19−25 Solvent plays an important role in the synthesis of such zinc clusters
or coordination polymers.26,27 Design of ligands28−33 and improvisation of noncovalent interactions of ligands are common
ways to synthesize complexes with less conventional coordination numbers
such as five-coordinated34,35 zinc complexes. A careful
look at the number of zinc complexes suggests that, irrespective of
ligands, they show emissions near 400–430 nm with some exceptions.1−8 Some d10 zinc complexes show sample- and size-dependent
fluorescence emissions,36 whereas in certain
cases, aggregation-induced emissions (AIE) of zinc complexes are comparable
to similar emissions by corresponding d10 cadmium complexes.37 Those observations together with the emergence
of AIEgens of zinc complexes38−41 and the development of newer aspects of AIEgens42,43 make one curious to explore the emission behavior of simple zinc
complexes. Furthermore, the AIEgens are generally developed from fluorescent
compounds, whereas a metal complex helps to bring together nonfluorescent
components to modulate emission based on metal-to-ligand charge-transfer
transitions. In such cases, d10 electronic configuration
is of a special interest, as it contributes to the emission through
charge-transfer transition.38−41 Hence, there is a necessity to look at the emissions
of representative zinc complexes of different independent structures.
It would be imperative to bring about significant structural variations
with a minimal change on the ligands to understand the effect of aggregation
of those complexes in their respective emissive properties. Hence,
we have undertaken this study on zinc complexes derived from binary
combinations of the positional isomers of nitrobenzoic acid and pyridinecarboxamide
shown in Figure 1.
The objective is to examine different types of structures and their
self-assembly in solid and solution to unearth aggregation-induced
emissions.44−46 The preliminary issues to be addressed are (i) characterization
of structures and self-assemblies of the zinc complexes derived from
positional isomeric ligands, (ii) theoretically formulating the relative
stabilities and the frontier orbitals of new structures formulated
based on the experimentally observed structures, and (iii) understanding
those complexes as precursors for AIE luminogens (AIEgens). In the
quest to obtain answers to these issues, we have taken up a study
on structural and theoretical aspects as well as emission properties
of five zinc complexes shown in Scheme 1. The choices of the ligands are based on the facts
that the zinc–nitrobenzoate complexes47,48 are well known to show structural varieties and the amide functional
group can provide hydrogen-bonding sites for the formation of directional
self-assemblies. Depending on the structure and the composition of
an ionic or a non-ionic d10 zinc(II) complex, the electronic
and steric factor would provide different impacts on emission properties,
whereas an amide group of a ligand would provide sites for the formation
of hydrogen bonds. The presence of an amide-containing ligand together
with a carboxylate ligand in a metal complex of such kinds would enhance
self-assembly required for an aggregation-induced emission.

Complexes
Results and Discussion
Synthesis
and Characterization of Zinc Complexes
The
reactions of positional isomers of nitrobenzoic acid together with
pyridine-4-carboxamide amide and zinc(II) acetate under ambient conditions
resulted in the formation of three different non-ionic zinc complexes
(Scheme 1). A similar
reaction of 2-nitrobenzoic acid and pyridine-3-carboxamide with zinc(II)
acetate provided a non-ionic complex, whereas a reaction of 4-nitrobenzoic
acid and pyridine-3-carboxamide with zinc(II) acetate yielded an ionic
complex. We could not obtain a crystalline product from the reaction
of 3-nitrobenzoic acid and pyridine-3-carboxamide with zinc(II) acetate.
Each isolated complex was structurally characterized by single-crystal
X-ray crystallography and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Figure S1), 1H NMR (Figures S2–S6), and 13C NMR spectroscopy
(Figures S7–S10). Attempts to prepare
the complex in other compositions by varying the stoichiometry of
the reactants were not successful. The phase purity of each complex
was determined by recording their respective powder XRD pattern and
comparing those patterns with the powder XRD pattern generated from
the respective CIF file. The literature suggests wide structural variations
in isonicotimide-containing zinc complexes depending on the partner
carboxylic acid;47,49 in certain cases, dinuclear complexes
were observed.50

The complex bis(pyridine-4-carboxamide)di(4-nitrobenzoato)zinc(II)·methanol
(1) is a mononuclear complex with tetrahedral geometry
(Figure 2a). The complex
has two pyridine-4-carboxamide molecules as N-donor ligands and two
monodentate 4-nitrobenzoates to provide a N2O2 environment to the central zinc ion. The complex is devoid of a
coordinating solvent, but it has a methanol molecule as a solvent
of crystallization. The structure of the complex is shown in Figure 2a; it has a symmetric
structure where each pair of identical ligands is related by a mirror
plane. The Zn1–N1 bond distance is 2.032(2) Å, and the
Zn1–O2 bond distance is 1.951(18) Å. The 1H
NMR spectra of the complex show signals for the protons of the two
aromatic ligands. Each has AA′BB′ patterns, which are
expected to appear at four independent chemical shift positions, but
these are observed as three sets of protons. The proton signal appearing
as broad unresolved peaks at 7.77 ppm are from the nitrobenzoate ring.
The AA′BB′ pattern observed at 8.27 and 8.15 ppm are
from the hydrogen atoms of pyridine-4-carboxamide. This is also supported
by the corresponding integration of the proton signals at those chemical
shift positions (refer to Supporting Figure S2). The amide protons appear as a broad peak at 8.74 ppm; broad nature
suggests a slow exchange of hydrogen atoms of the amide group with
water molecules present in the solvent. The IR spectra of the complex
has a 1408 cm–1 sharp peak due to the nitro group.
It shows broad peaks at 3443 cm–1 for the O–H
of the solvent and 3370 and 3156 cm–1 for stretching
due to hydrogen-bonded N–H bond of the amide group.

with 50% thermal ellipsoids).

The six-coordinated complex bis(pyridine-4-carboxamide)(aqua)di(2-nitrobenzoato)zinc(II)
(2) with two pyridine-4-carboxamide molecules at trans positions was obtained from the reaction of zinc acetate
with pyridine-4-carboxamide and 2-nitrobenzoic acid. This structure
is not unusual and come across in similar combination with a cobalt
analogue reported earlier.51 There are
also ample examples of complexes based on nitrobenzoate and nicotinamide
ligands with first row transition metal ions to suggest that structures
of those complexes varies with the central metal ion.52,53 Among, the two carboxylates coordinating to zinc ion in the complex,
one carboxylate is monodentate, and the other is bis-chelating. A
water molecule occupies the sixth coordination site. The two Zn–N
bonds are 2.166(4) and 2.188(3) Å, whereas the three Zn–Ocarboxy bonds are 2.013(2), 2.151(2), and 2.409(3) Å,
respectively (Figure 2b). The relatively large Zn1–O8 bond shows that the carboxylate
is not chelating to the zinc ion in a symmetric manner; an oxygen
atom is very weakly bound to the zinc ion with respect to the other
ligating oxygen atom. On the other hand, the Zn–Oaqua bond distance is 2.032(3) Å, which is indicative of having
a tightly bound water molecule in the complex. The complex shows complementing
intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the amides. 1H NMR
of the complex has signals for the protons of pyridine-4-carboxamide
at 7.76 and 8.70 ppm, whereas 2-nitrobenzoate shows peaks at 7.57
and 7.65 ppm, and other peaks overlap with the ring protons of pyridine-4-carboxamide
appearing at 7.76 ppm. The NH2 protons appear at 8.31 ppm
as a sharp peak. The compound shows characteristic NO2 stretching
signals at 1523 and 1384 cm–1. The O–H and
N–H stretching is observed as a broad and sharp peak at 3392
cm–1. The two peaks at 1690 and 1523 cm–1 are assigned to amide I and amide II stretching, respectively. The
signal at 1613 cm–1 is due to carboxylate stretching.

In contrast to these, the zinc-3-nitrobenzoate complex with pyridine-4-carboxamide
is a dinuclear complex. The complex di-μ2-(3-nitrobenzoato)[(methanol)(pyridine-3-carboxamide)(3-nitrobenzoato)zinc(II)]
(3) has two equivalent zinc ions, each possesses one
pyridine-4-carboxamide, a methanol molecule, and a bis-chelated 3-nitrobenzoate
ligand to form one site, and two such sites are bridged through two
carboxylate bridges offered by two 3-nitrobenzoates, which provide
the skeleton of the binuclear complex. The interesting feature of
the complex is that each zinc site is pentacoordinated with slightly
distorted trigonal-bipyramidal geometry (Figure 2c). The geometry around each metal ion is
a distorted trigonal bipyramid. This geometry is reflected in the
bond angles forming the trigonal plane. Namely, these bond angles
are 124.8(8)° (∠O1–Zn1–O2), 92.9 (9)°
(∠O1–Zn1–O6), and 141.7(8)° (∠O2–Zn1–O6),
whereas the bond angle between the two axial bonds is 177.27(8)°
(∠O9–Zn1–N3). The Zn1–O1, Zn1–O2,
Zn1–O6, and Zn1–O9 bond distances are 2.022(2), 2.024(2),
2.036(2), and 2.090(2) Å, respectively, whereas the Zn1–N3
bond distance is 2.134(2) Å. These are in the range of conventional
zinc–oxygen and zinc–nitrogen complex found in zinc
carboxylate complexes. Generally, paddle-wheel structures, μ2-bridging mode54 of carboxylate
alone or together with side-on μ1-bridging mode,55 are observed in zinc carboxylate complexes.
In the present case, complex 3 has two bridging carboxylates
and two monodentate carboxylates. Such a bonding scheme provides an
unconventional structure and geometry, leaving scopes for further
transformations of such a backbone. In solution, the 1H
NMR spectra of the complex do not distinguish the bridging and terminal
3-nitrobenzoate ligands. This is possibly due to a fast exchange,
which is not noticed at the NMR time scale. There are signals at 7.77
and 8.31 ppm for the ring protons of pyridine-4-carboxamide. The amide
protons appear at 8.66 ppm, whereas the ring protons of 3-nitrobenzoate
are observed at 8.29, 8.35, and 7.71 ppm. The coordinated methanol
gives peaks at 4.21 ppm for O–H and at 3.16 ppm for methoxy
protons. There are two peaks in 13C NMR for carbonyl carbons
of the amide and carboxylic acid at 169.34 and 166.67 ppm, respectively.
The signal for the bridging methanol molecules of the complex is observed
as one peak at 48.92 ppm. These point out the symmetric nature of
the complex existing in solution. The complex shows IR absorption
for O–H of methanol at 3582 cm–1; the N–H
stretching and amide I and amide II bands of amides appear at 3317,
1687, and 1561 cm–1, respectively, whereas there
is stretching at 1612 cm–1 due to carboxylate. The
absorption due to the nitro group stretching is observed at 1525 and
1475 cm–1. No clear distinctions on bridging and
terminal carboxylate could be seen from the solid-state IR spectra
also.

The activation energy to form a chelate from a monodentate
carboxylate
is about 6 kJ/mol.56 This small barrier
enables metal–carboxylate complexes to adopt varieties of structures
upon slight variations on the ligands and reaction conditions. Thus,
pyridine-3-carboxamide, which is another positional isomer, was used
to prepare similar zinc complexes. We found large differences in the
compositions and structures of the complexes from the complexes of
pyridine-4-carboxamide. Namely, the complex prepared from a combination
of pyridine-3-carboxamide and 2-nitrobenzoic acid reacting with zinc(II)
acetate provided (di-aqua)bis(pyridine-3-carboxamide)di(2-nitrobenzoato)zinc(II)
monohydrate (4). This hexacoordinated complex has an
octahedral geometry. It has two water molecules at the axial positions trans to each other, whereas the 2-nitrobenzoates and pyridine-3-carboxamide
molecules occupy the basal plane of the distorted octahedral geometry.
The ligands of same kinds occupy trans positions.
The Zn–Ocarboxy, Zn–Oaqua, and
Zn–N bond distances are 2.184(12), 2.120(13), and 2.145(15)
Å, respectively (Figure 2d). The 1: 1 ratio of the two ligands is reflected in the
integration of the 1H NMR spectra of the complex. The protons
of the pyridine-3-caboxamide ring appear at 9.02, 8.70, and 7.79 ppm.
The amide peak appears as multiplet peak at 8.16–8.21 ppm,
suggesting an independent environment for two amides. The O–H
stretching and amide stretching of the complex are observed at 3388
and 3154 cm–1, whereas the amide I and amide II
bands are observed at 1681 and 1601 cm–1, respectively.
Nitro stretching is observed at 1534 and 1440 cm–1.

Finally, the complex [triaqua(pyridine-3-carboxamide)(κ-O-κ-O′-4-nitrobenzoato)zinc(II)]4-nitrobenzoate
(5) is an exception among the five complexes as it is
obtained as an ionic complex. The ratio of pyridine-3-carboxamide
in complexes 4 and 5 is different. Complex 5 has one 4-nitrobenzoate as a chelating ligand, and it also
has a 4-nitrobenzoate anion outside the coordination sphere. The complex
has one pyridine-3-carboxamide molecule as the N-donor ligand, and
there are three water molecules coordinating to zinc ions. The three
water molecules in the coordination sphere are meridional. The carboxylate
chelate is almost symmetric, and the two Zn–Ocarboxy bond distances are 2.167(3) and 2.188(3) Å (Figure 2e). The two water molecules
are tightly bound to the zinc ion, where Zn–Oaqua distances are 2.089(4) and 2.011(3) Å, whereas the third water
molecule is weakly bound, and it has a zinc–oxygen bond distance
of 2.204(3) Å. The zinc–nitrogen bond distance is 2.056(4)
Å. The 4-nitrobenzoate group shows AA′BB′ signals
for pyridine-3-carboxamide at 8.26 and 8.16 ppm. The 1H
NMR signals however do not distinguish the anionic or ligating nitrobenzoate.
This complex also shows the two CH signals at 9.03 and 8.70 ppm. The 13C NMR spectra of the complex have two 13C signals
for C=O at 169.60 and 166.76 ppm, suggesting only one complex
in solution. The IR spectra shows OH stretching at 3556 cm–1, amide N–H at 3428–3115 cm–1, amide
I at 1680 cm–1, and amide II band at 1609 cm–1. The nitro groups show characteristic absorptions
at 1558 and 1427 cm–1. Furthermore, the complex 5 is an ionic complex in contrast to all other non-ionic complexes
observed in this study. The fundamental differences between these
two complexes 4 and 5 are in the coordination
numbers, geometries, numbers of pyridinecarboxamide ligand per zinc
ion, the binding behavior of the carboxylates, and the water of crystallization.

Each complex is self-associated through hydrogen bonds. The self-assemblies
of the complexes 1–3 are shown in Supporting Figure S11–S13. There are interesting
aspects on hydrogen bonds in the self-assemblies of complexes 4 and 5. The self-assembly of complex 4 has intramolecular hydrogen bonds involving the coordinated water
molecule (Figure 3a).
The amide–amide hydrogen bonds are prominent in the self-assembly.
The water of crystallization molecules has a role in the formation
of self-assembly of complex 4. The oxygen atoms of neighboring
carboxylates of the nitrobenzoate ligands are intermolecularly linked
through hydrogen-bonded bridges offered by the water molecule of crystallization,
whereas complex 5 has two water molecules occupying cis positions, which form complementary charge-assisted
hydrogen bonds of cyclic synthons (Figure 3b). The third water molecule on the complex
forms hydrogen bonds with an oxygen atom of a nitro group and an oxygen
atom of an amide group of two independent molecules of the complex
(Figure 3c). The hydrogen-bond
parameters are listed in Supporting Table S3.

Fluorescence Emission of the Complexes
There are scopes
to understand the mechanistic aspects of the emission properties of
discrete and self-assemblies of zinc complexes.57−60 Complexes 1–5 in the solid state are weakly fluorescent and emit around 434–463
nm upon excitation at 350 nm (Figure 4). The observed emissions are similar to the one observed
from the aggregation-induced emissions from self-assemblies of zinc
complexes.61 Theoretical calculations based
on density functional theory (DFT) using the B3LYP functional with
LANL2DZ as a basis set have suggested that HOMO–LUMO gaps for
complexes 1–4 as 299.72, 334.22, 328.01, and 317.13
nm, respectively. Further to these, TD-DFT calculations performed
have predicted that the absorptions of complexes 1–5 are at 340, 383, 332, 392, and 326 nm, respectively (Table 1).

463 nm), (iv) complex 4 (λem = 439 nm),
and (v) complex 5 (λem = 448 nm) (λex = 350 nm in all cases).

a In each case, biexponential decay
is observed, and only the higher lifetime relating AIE is shown here.

Thus, the experimentally observed
emissions are at much longer
wavelengths than those theoretically expected S1 to S0 transitions. The emissions observed at a higher wavelength
in the solid state as compared to theoretical gaps suggest an aggregation-induced
emission. The PolyQ value for all the complexes were determined varied
between 0.56 and 13.56% are listed in Table S2. Among the complexes, complex 4 has the highest quantum
yield, whereas ionic complex 5 has the least quantum
yield. The rates of radiative and non-radiative emission paths are
calculated and listed in Table 1. The radiative transitions are indicative of closely associated
multiple energy levels to have decayed through energy dissipation,
which points toward an aggregation-induced emission.

The relative
magnitude of the quantum yields (PolyQ) are in the
order complex 4 > complex 2 > complex 3 > complex 1 > complex 5.
Complex 5 is weakly fluorescent with a quantum yield
of 0.56%; relative
to complex 5, complex 4 has 21.4 times higher
PolyQ, whereas complex 3 has 7.4 times higher PolyQ than
complex 5. The PolyQ value of the solid sample of complex 3 is comparable to complex 1. The lifetime decay
profile of each complex shows biexponential decay. Among the two lifetimes
observed in each case, a higher fraction of molecules (approximately
60% in each case) follows a relatively shorter decay path having a
lifetime in range of 0.558–0.848 ns. The rest of the excited
molecules follows another path that has lifetimes in the range of
3.025–4.553 ns. In earlier lifetime studies on zinc–salen
complexes, the biexponential lifetime was observed in solid samples,
which was suggested to arise from different orientations of self-assembled
molecules in the unit cell.59 The observed
emissions are aggregation-induced as the emissions occur at relatively
higher wavelengths than those expected from theoretically calculated
HOMO–LUMO gaps, and also the emission decay profiles are similar.
Relative intensities of the shoulder on the principal emission peak
in each case differ from each other. The shoulders of the principal
peaks are attributed to different fast exchanging assemblies. Hence,
the overall change in the intensity of the respective complex is due
to change in the coordination contributing to facilitate or modify
the domains in each assembly to influence the transition probabilities
and wavelength of emission. There are a large number of AIEgens in
which there is an initial increase in emission intensity followed
by quenching.59−61 In well-defined assemblies of resorcin-4-calixarene
dissolved in a chloroform–water mixture, the distribution of
water molecules in an internal and external periphery of the self-assembled
structure is distinguishable at different concentrations.62 The emission spectra of complexes 1–5 in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution show aggregation-induced emissions
(Figure 5). In each
case, the prominent emission is at a wavelength varying from 396 to 441 nm. The emission in each
case initially increases followed by quenching upon addition of water,
and the profiles are shown in Figure 4. Complex 3 has emissions at 412 and 431
nm and a shoulder at 397 nm, and the intensities of emissions are
enhanced when the solution contains 10% water; after this concentration,
there is a continuous decrease in the emission, and the emission peak
positions change to show a distinct low-intensity emission peak in
the wavelength that range between 380 and 397 nm. The changes are
attributed to initial water-assisted aggregation, which, upon progressive
addition of water, breaks down to show the emission of monomeric species.
On the other hand, complex 4 shows an increase in emission
at 416 nm till 10% water, and then emission intensity is reduced;
while quenching, it shifts to 397 nm. Similarly, complex 5 shows enhancement of emissions at 396, 417, and 441 nm until 30%
water content in solution; beyond this, there is a decreasing trend
in emission intensities upon further increase in the percentage of
water.

Figure 5 Fluorescence emission spectra (λex = 350 nm) of
complexes (a) 1, (b) 2, (c) 3, (d) 4, and (e) 5 (each complex is 10–4 M in dimethyl sulfoxide) upon addition of different
amounts of water (thick lines show an initial increase, whereas dotted
lines show a decrease in emission).

In this case, there is a very small shift in the position of emission.
Hence, a change in aggregation followed by the formation of a compartmentalized
aggregate or segregation of aggregate is taking place. Similar trends
are observed from other complexes, supporting a similar mechanism
operative upon addition of water in each case. It may be noted that
the aggregation-induced emissions are reported of zinc complexes with
fluorescence-active ligands.38−41 However, in the present study, the ligands are nonfluorescent.
The quantum yield of each complex in DMSO is very low, yet they provide
enough emissions to study the enhancement and decrease due to aggregation.
Since the HOMOs are associated with the metal part and the LUMOs are
ligand-centric, it may be suggested that charge-transfer emission
of these complexes could be modulated through aggregation.

The
complexes remain as aggregates in solution and changes with
the concentration of water, which are reflected in the dynamic light
scattering studies enlisted in Figures S21–S24. The complex 1 dissolved in DMSO shows an average particle
size of 577.7 nm, and the same complex in DMSO having 50% water has
an average particle size of 765.3 nm. This shows an increase in the
size of the particles of the aggregate upon addition of water. This
is also the case found in the other examples listed in Table 2. Complexes 1 and 2 have clear unimodal aggregation. Complex 3 has
three different sets of aggregates, which convert to one set upon
dilution. Dilution caused segregation of particles in the case of
complex 4 to form two independent aggregates. The photoluminescence
decay profile in solution was determined for each complex dissolved
in DMSO and DMSO containing 50% water. It is observed that, in each
case, there is a biexponential path. Each complex dissolved in dimethyl
sulfoxide shows that a major fraction follows emission decay through
a shorter lifetime of less than 1 ns, whereas a minor portion of the
complexes passes through a relatively longer lifetime ranging between
4.9 and 6.9 ns. The trend changes on addition of 10% water; in such
a situation, a higher fraction follows a relatively longer lifetime
path (Table 2). These
indicate that water-assisted aggregation formed initially (revealed
in the DLS study) caused enhancement to follow a higher lifetime emission
path.

The energies
of the four non-ionic forms of complexes 1–4 are
optimized by DFT calculation Figure 6. Each synthesized complex is taken as a
reference to form different combinations as shown in Figure 6, which are taken up for energy
calculations. Complexes 1a, 1b, and 1c have energy differences from the energy of complex 1 as +52.8820, −3.1285, and +76.1563 kJ/mol, respectively.
Similarly, energy differences of the respective complexes 2a, 2b, and 2c are −37.0616, −37.0437,
and +34.5274 kJ/mol, respectively, from the energy of complex 2. The energy differences of complexes 3a, 3b, and 3c are +104.0622, −80.3414, and
+61.4571 kJ/mol, respectively, from the energy of complex 3, whereas complexes 4a, 4b, and 4c have energy differences of −51.2910, +16.3595, and +48.9086 kJ/mol, respectively, from complex 4. Hence, the experimentally observed complexes except complex 3 are not the one that has the lowest energy among the different
forms that are formulated in each case for the purpose of comparison.
The observed complexes in the three cases are not the least stable
one among them. These complexes with a dimeric structure as that of
complex 3 have the lowest HOMO–LUMO energy gaps.
For example, HOMO–LUMO energy gaps for the S1 to
S0 transition are 3.7799 eV (328.01 nm) for 3, 3.2623 eV (380.05 nm) for 3a, 3.7342 eV (332.02 nm)
for 3b, and 3.0820 eV (402.28 nm) for 3c. HOMO–LUMO gaps are 4.1367 eV (299.72 nm) for complex 1, 3.2623 eV (380.05 nm) complex 1a, 4.2096 eV
(294.53 nm) complex 1b, and 3.7654 eV (329.27 nm) for
complex 1c. Similar gaps for complexes 2, 2a, 2b, and 2c are 334.22,
303.11, 297.12, and 324.71 nm, respectively. On the other hand, gaps
for the complexes with pyridine-3-carboxamide 4, 4a, 4b, and 4c are 317.13, 289.49,
318.36, and 296.56 nm, respectively. Similarly, for complex 5, the cationic parts of positional isomeric complexes listed
in Supporting Figure S30 are optimized.
The energy gaps of the cations are found to be between 274.63 and
316.02 nm. The observed emission for the complex 5 was
at 448 nm, which is a much longer wavelength from the anticipated
S1 to S0 transition.

Scheme 2 Water-Assisted Reorganized
Self-Assemblies
At the bottom are two photos
of two flowers called Asian foxtail (scientific name Uraria crinita) to show that aggregated floral parts
may be distributed differently showing similar aesthetic sense.

These results have shown that the emission in solution
occurs at
a higher wavelength than the theoretically calculated S1–S0 transition. Furthermore, the increase in the
concentration of water initially competes with the solvent to make
an organized structure by taking possible coordination sites and making
an assembly suitable for showing AIE. As the amount of water increases,
water reorganizes the assembly to segregate the self-assembled zinc
complexes yet provides scope to remain as newly formed assemblies
through fast exchange that are not detected in the NMR time scale
in solution.37 Such equilibriums are possible
as the change of solvents makes different zinc complexes27 and dimensionality of carboxylate polymers changes
with solvent coordination.56 The changes
in dimensionality also affect the photoluminescence properties.63 Water helping to construct self-assembly among
the complexes at a low concentration caused an increase in intensity
of emission followed by the decrease in emission intensity with wavelength
shift due to disruptions. These occurred due to equilibrium between
self-assemblies and lower nuclearity hydrated species as illustrated
in Scheme 2. We have
studied the 1H NMR titrations on possible exchanges of
ligands by externally adding different positional isomers of the pyridinecarboxamide
to solution of the individual complex. There was no exchange of ligands
as the spectra remained unchanged, showing inability to detect the
exchange at the NMR time scale.

Conclusions
This
study provides information on the various zinc complexes formed
from different positional isomers and unfolds significance of the
complex composed of nonfluorescent ligands to act as AIEgens in solid
and solution. Irrespective of structures adopted by the zinc complexes
derived from those positional isomers of nitrobenzoate and pyridinecarboxamide,
each shows aggregation-induced emission. The amounts of water needed
in solution for each complex to cause maximum emission intensity varied
from complex to complex. In solution, complexes 1–5 showing emission enhancement without a shift in wavelength of emission
upon addition of water are indicative of the formation of a suitable
assembly for aggregation-induced emission with assistance of water.
It is likely to favor intermolecular self-assembly among zinc complexes
at a lower water content. As the concentration of water increases,
participation of water molecules in the formation of hydrogen bonds
to reconstruct or reorganize the self-assemblies of the complexes
results in quenching of emissions with a shift of emission to a shorter
wavelength. A theoretical study has suggested that the wavelengths
of emission of these complexes with or without adding water do not
commensurate the calculated band gaps for the S1 to S0 transition. The complexes upon addition of excess water have
emissions that are close to the emission calculated for a dimeric
structure, showing disintegration of self-assemblies among the complex
by excess water. The theoretically calculated HOMO–LUMO gaps
of the four non-ionic forms suggest that the dinuclear carboxylate-bridged
zinc complexes formulated with a skeleton of complex 3 with different positional isomers have the least energies relative
to the ones formulated as mononuclear complexes.

Experimental Section
Physical
Measurements
Infrared spectra of the solid
samples were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer Spectrum-One FT-IR spectrophotometer
by making KBr pellets. Powder X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded
using a Bruker powder X-ray diffractometer D2 phaser. 1H NMR spectra of complexes were recorded on a BRUKER Ascend-600 MHz
NMR spectrometer using TMS as an internal standard. Elemental analyses
were done on a EuroEA elemental analyzer. Fluorescence emissions were
measured in a Horiba Jobin Yvon Fluoromax-4 spectrofluorometer by
taking definite amounts of solutions or definite amounts of solid
samples and exciting at a required wavelength. Quantum yields of the
solid samples were measured by taking a definite amount of the solid
and exciting at a required wavelength in a Horiba Jobin Yvon Fluoromax-4
spectrofluorometer using the Petite Integrating Sphere method. The
fluorescence emission (Ec) and the scatter
(Lc) for the sample and a blank (La and Ea) were recorded.
From these spectral measurements (sample and blank), the quantum yields
were calculated by using the equation φF = [(Ec – Ea)/La – Lc)].
The radiationless (knr) and radiative
rate constants (kr) are calculated by
using the formulas knr = (1 – ΦF)/τ and kr = ΦF/τ, where τ is the experimentally determined lifetime
of fluorescence decay.64

The average
particle sizes were determined by dynamic light scattering carried
out on a Malvern Zeta Sizer Nano ZS instrument equipped with a 4.0
mW He-Ne laser operating at 633 nm. The DFT and TD-DFT calculations
for complexes were carried out by using Gaussian 09W-64 1995–2013
using the B3LYP functional with LANL2DZ as a basis set, whereas complex 5 and the corresponding positional isomeric complexes based
on this complex are calculated as monocationic species.
