The catalytic steam
reforming (CSR) of biomass-derived acetic acid
over the commercial Ni-based catalyst (CNC) and the maize stalk ash-supported
Ni catalyst (Ni/MSA) for hydrogen-rich syngas production was studied
by means of a bench-scale fixed-bed unit combined with NDIR/TCD techniques.
A maize stalk ash-supported Ni catalyst was developed for steam reforming
of HOAc. The chemical composition and structural characteristics of
CNC and Ni/MSA catalysts were compared. Evolution characteristics
of H2 and CO during CSR of HOAc were explored. Between
600 and 900 °C, the yields of H2 and CO showed a similar
trend over time, which first increased rapidly to the peak value,
then began to decrease and finally tended to stabilize. The optimal
reaction conditions were as follows: temperature = 800 °C, water
to carbon molar ratio (WCMR) = 3, and weight hourly space velocity
(WHSV) = 5 h–1. Elevating the reforming temperature
up to 900 °C gave rise to the continuously increased H2 yield and enhanced catalyst ability for selective hydrogen production.
The percentage of coke deposited on the catalyst decreased by 49.8%
with the rise of temperature from 600 to 900 °C. The CO yield
continued to decrease with increasing WCMR from 1 to 7. Ni/MSA gave
similar CO yield to the CNC. The Ni/MSA exhibited better ability to
selectively generate hydrogen than the CNC, resulting in significantly
higher hydrogen yield.

Introduction
Hydrogen is one of the most promising
clean energy sources and
widely used in fuel cells, transportation, and power systems. As a
basic chemical material, hydrogen has wide applications in chemical
synthesis, food processing, petrochemical, and metallurgical industries.1 Currently, hydrogen is mainly derived from fossil
fuels.2 Considering the importance of environmental
issues and sustainable energy development, it is particularly important
to explore clean and renewable hydrogen production methods.

The utilization of renewable biomass for hydrogen generation can
reduce environmental pollution while reducing the reliance on fossil
fuels. The methods of hydrogen production from biomass mainly include
biological and thermochemical approaches.3,4 Among
them, the catalytic steam reforming (CSR) of bio-oils produced by
rapid pyrolysis of biomass is one of the most prospective routes to
produce hydrogen from biomass on an industrial scale, which is mainly
due to the advantages of this technology mentioned in several literature
studies.5,6 In addition, the CSR of one part of the
bio-oil can provide hydrogen to the hydrotreating process of the other
part, thereby enabling the hydrogen source self-sufficiency in the
catalytic hydrogenation conversion of the bio-oil and making the bio-oil
refining technology more economical and practical.7 However, the bio-oil contains a wide variety of components,
such as carboxylic acids, aldehydes, ketones, furans, phenols, and
sugars, making the reforming process very complicated. Acetic acid
(HOAc) is a typical carboxylic acid, whose content can be up to 20%
in bio-oils.8 Moreover, HOAc can be produced
in large quantities from biomass by fermentation. Therefore, HOAc
has been recognized as the important and representative derivative
of biomass to establish the correlations between the catalyst physicochemical
characteristics and its reforming performance for hydrogen production.

Currently, although some progress has been made in the theoretical
research and technology development of bio-oil CSR for hydrogen generation,
there are still many deficiencies. The main constraint is catalyst
deactivation due to carbon deposition, poisoning, and sintering.4,9 Therefore, to explore novel high-efficiency catalysts with high
catalytic activity, high selectivity, high stability, and easy regeneration
is the key to the development of bio-oil CSR technology, focusing
on how to enhance the structure stability and catalytic activity of
reforming catalysts and reduce the carbon deposition rate on the catalyst
surface. The studies on reforming catalysts of bio-oils and their
model compounds for hydrogen production have largely focused on noble
metal catalysts (such as Pt, Rh, Pd, Ru, and so forth.) and non-noble
metal Ni-based catalysts.10,11 Supported noble metal
catalysts have high catalytic activity and good stability,12 but they are expensive and have limited reserves,
which greatly limits their industrial application and is difficult
to suffice the needs of large-scale production of industrial catalysts.
Non-noble metal Ni-based catalysts are also fit for use as reforming
catalysts for hydrogen production because of their low cost and good
catalytic activity,13,14 but they still have problems
such as weak stability, poor carbon deposition ability, and easy deactivation,
which impose certain restrictions on their industrial applications.
Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a novel high-efficiency
and inexpensive Ni-based catalyst which has excellent reactivity,
high selectivity, long-term stability, and easy regeneration for bio-oil
CSR to produce hydrogen.

At present, the studies on Ni-based
catalysts have mainly focused
on the influence and promotion mechanism of catalyst supports and
promoters. The introduction of suitable supports and promoters can
enhance the catalyst activity, structural stability, and carbon deposition
resistance. Adding a certain amount of alkali metal and alkaline earth
metal (such as K,15 Mg16), rare earth metal (such as La,17 Ce13) or transition metal (such as Fe,
Co, Cu17) promoters can increase the dispersion
of active components, improve the structural and chemical properties
of reforming catalysts, thereby enhancing their catalytic activity,
stability, and anti-carbon deposition ability. Most studies on nickel-based
catalyst carriers have focused on single metal oxide supports such
as Al2O3,18−20 MgO,21 SiO2,22 ZrO2,23 and composite oxide supports, such as CeO2–Al2O3,24 La2O3–Al2O3,25,26 CeO2–ZrO2,27 MgO–La2O3–Al2O3,28 and so on.

Straw ash
is a kind of solid waste generated after the burning
of crop straws, which is produced in large quantities in biomass power
plants and needs to be dealt with urgently. Otherwise, it will lead
to a series of environmental and health problems. At present, the
conventional treatment methods for straw ash include preparation of
concrete building materials, adsorbents, fertilizers, and so forth,
or improvement of soil by application to the field. It is emphasized
that the high value utilization of straw ash as a catalyst or catalyst
carrier needs to be further developed. As we all know, straw ash is
mainly composed of various oxides with high thermal stability, such
as SiO2, CaO, K2O, Al2O3, MgO, Na2O, Fe2O3, and so forth.
They have good catalytic or cocatalytic effects, among which K, Na,
Mg, and Fe are good promoters,29 while
Al2O3 and SiO2 are good catalyst
carriers.30 In particular, CaO has dual
functions as both a catalyst and an absorbent, which can realize the
in situ separation of CO2 in the reaction system.31 The above aspects confirm that straw ash has
excellent catalytic performance and has been previously used for catalytic
application in coal char gasification. However, there are very few
reports about its application in bio-oil CSR, and this aspect deserves
further exploration.

The objective of this study is to develop
an inexpensive and effective
straw ash-supported Ni catalyst for hydrogen-rich syngas generation
and explore its catalytic activities. In this study, the CSR of HOAc
as a representative bio-oil derivative over commercial nickel-based
catalyst and maize stalk ash-supported Ni catalysts for hydrogen production
was studied by means of a bench-scale fixed-bed unit combined with
the nondispersive infrared/thermal conductivity detection (NDIR/TCD)
techniques. The effects of reforming temperature, water to carbon
molar ratio (WCMR), and catalyst types on hydrogen production were
explored. This study combines the catalytic utilization of straw ash
with the clean generation of hydrogen from CSR of bio-oils.

Results
and Discussion
Chemical Reactions Involved in the CSR of
HOAc
The
chemical reactions involved in the catalytic reforming of HOAc are
very complex and can be described by R1–R20 shown in Table 1. Small molecule gases,
such as H2, CO, CO2, CH4, and so
forth, are produced in large quantities with a small amount of coke
during the catalytic reforming of HOAc. Ideally, HOAc and steam are
completely catalytically reformed to H2 and CO2, respectively, as indicated by R1. HOAc can be ketonized to acetone
(R3), dehydrated to form ketene (R4), or decomposed into CH4, CO2, and H2 by R5 and R6. The generation
of H2 may result from HOAc steam reforming (R1 and R2),
thermal decomposition (R6), water gas shift reaction (R7), methane
steam/dry reforming (R8–R10), and coke gasification (R20).
The formation of coke may be attributed to thermal decomposition of
HOAc and methane (R6 and R18), Boudouard reaction (R19) and the reduction
of carbon oxides (R15 and R16), and so forth. Other possible reactions
such as the methanation reaction (R11–R14) and the reverse
water gas shift reaction (R17) also occur in the steam reforming of
HOAc. Through the above analysis, it can be inferred that H2 can come from different reaction pathways. In order to increase
H2 yield, it is essential to provide sufficient waster
under appropriate reaction conditions to minimize the decomposition
and dehydration of HOAc.

Characteristics of the
Used Catalysts
The comparison
of chemical composition of MSA, CNC, and Ni/MSA based on XRF analysis
is displayed in Table 2. As we have reported before, the main components of the MSA are
SiO2, CaO, K2O, P2O5,
Al2O3, and MgO, which make up more than 90%
of MSA.32 In addition, a small amount of
Fe2O3 and Na2O are also present in
the MSA. SiO2 and Al2O3 have been
experimentally proven to be good catalyst supports. K, Na, Mg, and
Fe can be used as additives of reforming catalysts and have been proven
to have good catalytic or cocatalytic effects.29 In particular, the content of CaO in the MSA is as high
as 10%. CaO has dual functions as both a catalyst and an absorbent,
which can realize the in situ separation of CO2 in the
reaction system and help to increase H2 yield and purity.
The two catalysts, CNC and Ni/MSA, are similar in that they both contain
a higher amount of NiO (11.80 and 26.00% for CNC and Ni/MSA, respectively),
SiO2 (25.50, 30.60%), and Al2O3 (17.70,
2.25%). They differ in that the CNC contains a higher amount of ZrO2 (10.80%) and WO3 (32.20%), while Ni/MSA contains
a higher amount of K2O (14.50%), CaO (9.95%), MgO (4.29%),
and Fe2O3 (2.14%). The catalyst CNC is a rod-like
catalyst with a specific surface area and a pore volume of 72.25 m2/g and 0.156 cm3/g, respectively, while the catalyst
Ni/MSA is a powdery catalyst with a specific surface area of 2.46
m2/g and a pore volume of 0.011 cm3/g, which
are significantly smaller than those of the CNC.

According to the physical adsorption isotherm classification method
proposed by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry
(IUPAC), the adsorption isotherms for the fresh and reformed catalysts
can be classified as IV type, indicating that they belong to mesoporous
materials, which can also be confirmed from the data shown in Figure 1. From Figure 1a, in the lower relative pressure
(P/P0) region, the adsorption
isotherm is convex upward, similar to the type II isotherm, and the
adsorption mechanism is also basically the same. When P/P0 reaches about 0.4, the adsorbate
undergoes capillary condensation in the mesopores and the adsorption
capacity suddenly rises. When the capillary condensation of all the
mesopores is completed, the adsorption occurs only on the outer surface
much smaller than the inner surface, and the increasing trend of adsorption
capacity gradually slows down. The capillary condensation phenomenon
makes the adsorption/desorption isotherms unable to coincide and gives
rise to the occurrence of adsorption hysteresis and thus the formation
of hysteresis loops shown in Figure 1a. Compared to the fresh CNC catalyst, CNC600 gives
the higher amount of gas adsorbed. This is mainly due to the formation
of some new pores and the opening of the part of closed pores caused
by increasing temperature. However, when the temperature is further
increased, the adsorbed quantity is always reduced.

(b) PSD diagram, (c) SSAD diagram, and (d)
porosity characteristics for the fresh and reformed CNC catalyst.

Pore size distribution (PSD) and specific surface
area distribution
(SSAD) diagrams for the fresh and used CNC catalysts under steam reforming
of different feedstocks are displayed in Figure 1b,c, respectively. As observed, compared
to the fresh catalyst, the steam reforming reaction results in considerable
variation in the PSD and SSAD of reformed catalysts, thus leading
to the visible changes in catalyst specific surface area values (see Figure 1d). The specific
surface area of the fresh catalyst is 72.25 m2/g, while
that of the reformed catalysts are 83.57, 69.24, 53.43, and 36.92
m2/g for CNC600, CNC700, CNC800, and CNC900, respectively.
The specific surface area and pore volume of the reformed catalysts
are decreased by 55.8 and 16.8% with increase in temperature from
600 to 900 °C. Correspondingly, the average pore diameter of
the reformed catalysts is increased with temperature.

XRD Analysis
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of
the fresh CNC, Ni/MSA, and used CNC, Ni/MSA catalysts under steam
reforming at temperature = 800 °C, WCMR = 3, and weight hourly
space velocity (WHSV) = 5 h–1 are shown in Figure 2. As the fresh and
used catalysts contain very complex substances, the XRD patterns shown
are the superposition of the diffraction peaks of various internal
phases. The absorption or reflection of X-ray is different for each
component in a catalyst, which is related not only to the content
and crystallinity of the substance but also to the existence of other
substances in the catalyst. In addition, there may be diffraction
peaks at the same angle for different substances, but the peak intensities
are different. The occurrence of XRD peak overlap makes it difficult
to accurately analyze the catalyst crystal structure. Therefore, the
detected substances can not cover all the substances in the catalysts.
The three peaks in the XRD spectrum of the fresh Ni/MSA are clearly
visible at 2θ = 37.1°, 43.3, and 62.9°, as shown in Figure 2. As mentioned by
Li et al.,33 the three peaks at 2θ
= 37.1°, 43.3, and 62.9° are assigned to the NiO(111), NiO(200),
and NiO(220) bands, respectively. For the fresh CNC catalyst, the
band assigned to NiO(111) can be observed, while the other two bands
are not obvious. Furthermore, CNC has the characteristic diffraction
bands of NiWO4 with 2θ of 24.9°, 30.9°,
and 36.6°. Moreover, there are diffraction peaks of A12O3 observed at 2θ = 31.1°, 32.8°, and
37.0°. However, the characteristic diffraction bands of SiO2 and ZrO2 are not obvious, though the contents
of silicon and zirconium are relatively high. This may be due to the
fact that they are not present in the catalyst in the form of oxide
crystallites. Another possible and reasonable reason is that they
are highly dispersed on the surface of the catalyst support.

Figure 2 XRD spectra
of the fresh CNC, Ni/MSA, and reformed CNC, Ni/MSA
catalysts at temperature = 800 °C, WCMR = 3, and WHSV = 5 h–1.

The XRD patterns of the
fresh and used CNC catalysts are compared
in Figure 3. The used
CNC catalysts at 600 and 700 °C exhibit a similar XRD pattern
as compared to fresh CNC. The weak peak corresponding to Ni(111) at
2θ = 44.7° can be observed, which means that the content
of active constituent metal Ni is relatively low, suggesting the weak
catalytic activity of the CNC at 600 and 700 °C. This is consistent
with the experimental results shown in Figure 4. When the reforming temperature is increased
above 800 °C, the intensity of the Ni(111) peak is significantly
increased. At the same time, a new diffraction peak appears at 2θ
= 51.8°, corresponding to the Ni(200) peak. These results indicate
a continuous increase in the reduction degree of NiO in the catalyst
with elevating temperature. Raising temperature favors the reduction
of more NiO in the catalyst to Ni, which is attributed to the reaction
of NiO + H2 → Ni + H2O. Therefore, increasing
the reforming temperature is beneficial for increasing the catalyst
activity. However, the temperature should not be too high because
too high temperature will lead to the aggregation and sintering of
catalyst particles, resulting in its deactivation.

and reformed CNC catalysts at different temperatures.

Figure 4 Evolution of H2 and CO from the CSR of HOAc at different
reforming temperatures.

Effect of Reforming Temperature
on Steam Reforming of HOAc
Temperature is a very crucial
parameter affecting the CSR of the
bio-oil. The influence of reforming temperature on the evolution characteristics
of H2 and CO from the CSR of HOAc at WCMR = 3 and WHSV
= 5 h–1 is shown in Figure 4. At the beginning of the reforming process,
the reforming reaction is very intense, and the H2 yield
increases sharply with reaction time to the peak values of 14.9, 22.5,
24.7, and 27.1%, corresponding to 600, 700, 800, and 900 °C.
After that, the yield of H2 exhibits a downward trend,
indicating that the catalyst ability for selective H2 production
gradually decreases. Because as the reaction proceeds, the intermediates
are generated in large amounts during the CSR of HOAc and cover the
catalyst surface, which hinder the effective contact of the reactants
(e.g., HOAc, H2O, CO, and so forth.) with the catalyst.
In addition, different reactions are competitive at the catalyst active
sites. The above factors inhibit the reactions [HOAc steam reforming
(R1 and R2), thermal decomposition (R6), water gas shift reaction
(R7), methane steam/dry reforming (R8–R10), and coke gasification
(R20)] associated with hydrogen generation, resulting in the decrease
of hydrogen yield and the lessened ability of the catalysts to selectively
generate hydrogen. When the reaction time exceeds 10 min, the decreasing
trend of H2 yield gradually slows down in response to the
increase of reaction time. In the range of 600–900 °C
studied, the yields of both H2 and CO show a similar trend,
which rapidly increase to the highest values, then decrease continuously,
and finally stabilizes. Raising the reforming temperature up to 900
°C gives rise to the continuous increment of H2 yield
and the enhanced ability of the catalysts for selective hydrogen production.
Such observations were also mentioned by Salehi et al.34 when conducting the CSR of bio-oil over Ni/Al2O3 catalysts in the range of 750–950 °C.
Therefore, the suitable reforming temperature should be above 800
°C. Considering that the yield of CO is the highest at 800 °C,
and CO can be converted to H2 by water gas shift reaction
under suitable conditions, 800 °C is the optimal temperature
from the perspective of potential H2 yield and energy saving.

Coke deposition on the catalyst is one of the major obstacles of
bio-oil CSR technology, which not only leads to the reduction of H2 yield but also to catalyst poisoning, deactivation, and even
reactor blockage. Therefore, it is very important to avoid or inhibit
coke formation. The amount of coke formed on the reforming catalyst
was analyzed by DTG. Figure 5 shows the effect of reforming temperature on the percentage
of coke deposited on the catalyst. With the reforming temperature
being raised from 600 to 900 °C, the percentage of coke deposited
on the catalyst decreases from 2.69 to 1.35%, confirming that raising
temperature favors the reduction of the amount of coke deposits on
the catalyst surface and the improvement of its catalytic activity.
Coke formation is mainly attributed to the catalytic cracking reactions,
Boudouard reaction and reduction of carbon oxides, and so forth.35,36

Figure 5 Effect
of reforming temperature on the percentage of catalyst coke
deposits at the operational conditions of WCMR = 3 and WHSV = 5 h–1.

Effect of WCMR on Steam
Reforming of HOAc
The WCMR
can be changed by adjusting the feed rate of HOAc and water. Figure 6 shows the influence
of WCMR on the evolution characteristics of H2 and CO at
temperature = 800 °C and WHSV = 5 h–1. When
HOAc and steam are completely catalytically reformed to H2 and CO2 under ideal circumstances, the corresponding
WCMR is 1. H2 yields at WCMR = 3 and 7 are close to that
at WCMR = 1. This research finding is different from those reported
in other studies.37,38 Wang et al.37 performed the CSR of HOAc over Ni/La2O3–Al2O3 catalysts and found that raising
the WCMR from 1 to 5 gave rise to a continuous increase in H2 yield. Wang et al.38 examined the effect
of WCMR on the CSR of HOAc over coal ash-supported Ni catalyst and
pointed out that the H2 yield constantly increased from
44.2% to approximately 60% with raising the WCMR from 1 to 7.5. Considering
the fact that HOAc is difficult to fully and effectively contact with
steam and to be completely converted to H2 and CO2 in actual situations, the WCMR of 3 is an optimum choice to ensure
good hydrogen production effect. At a constant feeding rate of HOAc,
increasing the WCMR means that the water feeding rate is increased,
which, on the one hand, ensures the effective contact of HOAc with
steam and maximizes the carbon conversion; on the other hand, it promotes
the water gas shift reaction equilibrium toward the positive direction
of hydrogen generation and the catalytic gasification of coke deposits
on the catalyst. The aspects described above are beneficial to increase
the H2 yield. However, the WCMR should not be too large.
This, on the one hand, causes too much water vapor to be wasted because
of not participating in the reforming reaction and has a detrimental
effect on the purification of the downstream gas; on the other hand,
the residence time of the reactants on the catalyst bed is reduced
so that some of the reactants are too late to be converted and carried
away by excess water vapor, causing carbon conversion to decrease
with increase in the WCMR, as evidenced by the experimental data shown
in Figure 6.

Figure 6 Influence of
the WCMR on the evolution characteristics of H2 and CO
at the operational conditions of temperature = 800
°C and WHSV = 5 h–1.

At a WCMR of 1, the yield of CO is highest for a given time, and
as the WCMR increases, the CO yield decreases. This observation is
consistent with our previous study5 when
testing Ni–Ce/Al2O3 catalysts for bio-oil
CSR in the WCMR range of 1–9. The main gas products produced
by catalytic reforming of HOAc at WCMR = 1 are H2 and CO.
The increase in WCMR causes the water gas shift and methanation reaction
equilibrium toward the positive direction, resulting in the continuous
consumption of CO and H2 and the generation of more CO2 and CH4. This may explain why there is no significant
increase in H2 yield with increase in the WCMR. With further
increase of the WCMR, the water vapor has an increased feeding rate
without changing that of HOAc and can carry some of the reactants
away so that the residence time of the reactants in the catalyst bed
is reduced, causing the decrease of carbon conversion and main gas
yields with the increase of the WCMR.

Effect of Catalysts on
Steam Reforming of HOAc
In the
three cases of no catalyst, CNC, and Ni/MSA, the evolution characteristics
of H2 and CO with time at temperature = 800 °C, WCMR
= 3, and WHSV = 5 h–1 are exhibited in Figure 7. From the perspective
of H2 yield and carbon conversion, the catalytic reforming
of HOAc over CNC and Ni/MSA is much better than that in the absence
of the catalyst. In the presence of the CNC and Ni/MSA catalysts,
the H2 yield increases rapidly to a maximum with reaction
time, then slowly decreases, and finally gradually stabilizes. Ni/MSA
gives significantly higher H2 yields than the CNC. However,
almost the same carbon conversions are obtained over the two catalysts.
The above information proves that Ni/MSA has the better ability to
selectively generate hydrogen than CNC, resulting in significantly
higher H2 yield. The yield of CO has a similar trend to
that of H2, which increases rapidly to a maximum at the
initial stage of the reforming process, then decreases with the progress
of reforming reaction, and finally stabilizes. The CO yield is much
greater in the presence of the CNC and Ni/MSA than that without the
catalyst. To explore the stability of Ni/MSA, the CSR of HOAc was
carried out for 7 h at 800 °C with a WCMR of 3 and WHSV of 5
h–1. Figure 8 shows H2, CO yields, and carbon conversion as
a function of time on stream. The Ni/MSA catalysts are relatively
stable for the CSR of HOAc within 7 h, corresponding to the slight
decrease of H2 and CO yields, which can be confirmed by
the carbon conversion data exhibited in Figure 8. The above information confirms that Ni/MSA
has good resistance to carbon deposition. In addition, Ni/MSA has
the better ability to selectively generate hydrogen than the CNC.
Therefore, Ni/MSA shows great potential because of its low cost and
environmental benefit by utilizing the maize stalk ash as its support.

Conclusions
A maize stalk ash-supported
Ni catalyst was developed for steam
reforming of HOAc. The chemical composition and structural characteristics
of the CNC and Ni/MSA catalysts were compared. Evolution characteristics
of H2 and CO during CSR of HOAc were explored. Between
600 and 900 °C, the yields of H2 and CO showed a similar
trend over time, which first increased rapidly to the peak value,
then began to decrease, and finally tended to stabilize. The optimal
reaction conditions were temperature = 800 °C, WCMR = 3, and
WHSV = 5 h–1. Elevating the reforming temperature
up to 900 °C gave rise to the continuously increased H2 yield and the enhanced catalyst ability for selective hydrogen production.
The percentage of coke deposited on the catalyst decreased by 49.8%
with the rise of temperature from 600 to 900 °C. The CO yield
continued to decrease with increasing the WCMR from 1 to 7. Ni/MSA
gave a similar CO yield to the CNC. Ni/MSA exhibited better ability
to selectively generate hydrogen than the CNC, resulting in significantly
higher hydrogen yield.

The reforming
experiments were performed in a bench-scale fixed-bed unit combined
with the NDIR/TCD techniques. The schematic diagram of the reforming
system and the related details could be found in our previously published
paper.5 In each run, the catalysts were
first reduced in situ under a N2/H2 atmosphere.
Afterward, the reactor was purged with N2 and heated to
the target temperature between 600 and 900 °C. The bio-oil and
steam were then introduced to the reaction system through two peristaltic
pumps. The produced gas passed through a condensing system to mostly
separate excess water and some unconverted reactants. A cotton filter
was employed to capture residual condensable vapors to minimize interference
with the rear gas analyzers. The cleaned gas was dried through a silica
gel filter and then fed to a Gasboard-3100 analyzer based on the NDIR/TCD
method, a detailed explanation of which can also be found in our previous
paper.38 After each experiment, the catalyst
bed was purged and cooled to room temperature in a stream of N2. Subsequently, the catalyst bed, condenser, pipes, and filters
were removed and weighed. Finally, the air was sent into the reforming
reactor by combustion to clear away heavy tar from the tube wall.
The condenser and all possible condensation lines were cleaned with
acetone and the solvent was evaporated at 60 °C.

Catalysts Preparation,
Characterization, and Catalytic Performance
Evaluation
Maize stalk (MS) was collected from Zibo, central
region of Shandong province (China). After harvesting maize plants,
MS was first air-dried, crushed, and then sieved to obtain particles
below 80 mesh. The sieved particles were calcined at 815 °C for
30 min and then cooled to room temperature to obtain MS ash, which
was chosen as the catalyst support. The MS ash-supported Ni catalysts
were prepared by impregnation using the aqueous solution of nickel
nitrate supported on MS ash. A known amount of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O was dissolved in deionized water to
obtain an aqueous solution of nickel nitrate. Then, a certain amount
of prepared MS ash was slowly added to the above solution. The obtained
slurry was continuously stirred at room temperature for 3 h, then
dried at 110 °C for 48 h in a drying oven, and subsequently calcined
at 600 °C for 4 h in a muffle furnace. Finally, the MS ash-supported
Ni catalysts were obtained. The prepared MS ash, commercial nickel-based
catalyst, and MS ash-supported Ni catalyst were denoted as MSA, CNC,
and Ni/MSA, respectively. The reformed CNC catalysts were denoted
as CNCT, where T represents the reforming temperature.

The catalyst chemical composition was measured by a ZSX-100e X-ray
fluorescence spectrometer. The specific surface area and pore structure
characteristics of the catalysts were measured using an ASAP 2020
analyzer. The XRD measurements were conducted by using a Bruker AXS
D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffractometer. The amount of coke deposited on the
catalyst surface was analyzed by a WCT-1C thermogravimetric analyzer.
The temperature program was set to increase from room temperature
to 800 °C and maintained at this temperature for 10 min. The
weight loss of the catalyst was recorded online in real time. According
to the weight loss curves, the percentage of coke deposited on catalyst
could be obtained by calculation.

The performance evaluation
of the catalysts was carried out according
to the evolution characteristics of the main gas products and carbon
conversion. The H2 yield was defined as the ratio of the
moles of H2 produced to the theoretical maximum H2 amount corresponding to complete reforming of HOAc to CO2 and H2. The yields of CO, CO2, and CH4 were defined as the ratio of the moles of corresponding gas
produced to the moles of carbon in the feed. The carbon conversion
could be obtained by dividing the moles of carbon in the gaseous products
by the moles of feed carbon. The WCMR and WHSV were defined according
to the methods provided in our previous paper.5
