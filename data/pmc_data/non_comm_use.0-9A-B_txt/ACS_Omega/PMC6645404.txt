2-Chloro-4-nitrobenzoic acid (2c4n)
is an antiviral agent used
for the treatment of HIV infection and to boost the immune response
in immune deficiency diseases. In the present study, a series of eight
molecular salts of 2c4n with pyridyl and benzoic acid derivatives
have been synthesized by a crystal engineering approach and were characterized
structurally by various spectroscopic, thermal, and X-ray diffraction
techniques. Crystal structures of all synthesized molecular salts
were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction techniques. In
all synthesized molecular salts, the charge-assisted acid···pyridine/amine
heterosynthon was found to be the primary supramolecular synthon.
The synthesized salts, namely, 2c4n.g and 2c4n.h salts were found
to be isostructural. Further, in the current work, the occurrence
of weak halogen bonds in the presence of strong hydrogen bonds in
the synthesized and in the reported molecular salts/cocrystals of
2c4n has been investigated. A detailed inspection of the crystal structures
of salts/cocrystals of 2c4n was carried out to demonstrate the importance
of halogen bonds in these crystal structures. It was found that 4
out of 8 synthesized molecular salts and 12 out of 24 reported molecular
adducts of 2c4n were found to exhibit halogen bonds in their crystal
structures. A similar kind of conformational change was observed for
molecular salts exhibiting halogen bonds in their crystal structures;
however, the conformations were found to be slightly different in
other molecular salts. It was observed that two-point primary supramolecular
synthon and stronger intramolecular Cl···O halogen
bonds in the molecular adducts of 2c4n are found to be more susceptible
to exhibit halogen bonds in their crystal structures. Halogen bond
interactions played a vital role in the crystal stabilization of these
molecular adducts.

Introduction
Crystal engineering
has played a major role in understanding the
intermolecular interactions in the self-assembly of molecules and
invoked it to generate new supramolecular assemblies without forming
or breaking covalent bonds.1−3 In the rational design of the
supramolecular structure, various noncovalent interactions such as
hydrogen bonds,4−13 halogen bonds,14−24 van der Waals interactions, and π–π interactions25,26 play a vital role. In particular, these noncovalent interactions
have been extensively used in solid-state chemistry to assemble supramolecular
building blocks into well-defined crystal structures. Hydrogen bonds
are the unique tool in molecular recognition and play a master key
role in the packing of crystal structures.27−31 Halogen bonds32−34 have attracted significant attention
from the scientific community in recent years because of their vital
role in crystal packing. In the last decade, Resnati and Metrangolo
et al. have used halogen bonds extensively for studying the crystal
packing of iodoperflurocarbon molecules with aliphatic amines.35−39 Jennifer and Muthiah designed and synthesized the cocrystals/salts
of nitrogenous bases and thiophene carboxylic acid through a combination
of hydrogen and halogen bonds.40 Saha et
al. studied the halogen bond interactions in iodopyridine derivatives.41 Priimagi et al. reported the importance of halogen
bonds in designing the functional materials in the fields of biomimetics,
optics/photonics, functional surfaces, and photoswitchable supramolecules.42 Anion-sensing property of receptors composed
of halogen bond donor groups has been studied by Chudzinski et al.43 Further, applications in the fields of liquid
crystals, nanomaterials, polymer chemistry, inorganic chemistry, medicinal
chemistry, and biochemistry have been achieved using halogen bond
interactions.44

Halogen bonds are
not well-defined as hydrogen bonds, although
they have strength, directionality, and specificity similar to those
of hydrogen bonds.45,46 In general, halogen bonds are
defined as a noncovalent interaction between the halogen atom and
electron donors such as N, O, and S, similar to hydrogen bonds. The
theoretical and experimental studies on halogen bonds revealed that
there is an anisotropic distribution of electron clouds along the
covalently bonded halogen atom.47−50 As a result, a localized positive potential region
is formed at the surface of the halogen atom, known as a σ hole.51 The atoms having a nucleophilic character approach
the halogen atom toward the σ hole and facilitate the formation
of halogen bonds. Therefore, halogen bonds can be considered as the
attractive interaction between the positive electrostatic potential
region of a halogen atom and a negative site (halogen or electronegative
atoms). This was well-explained by Politzer et al. in 2014 based on
the computational methods.52 However, in
late 1980s, Desiraju and Parthasarathy demonstrated that because of
the anisotropically segregated region of complementary electrostatic
potential, halogen–halogen interaction is possible in the halogen
atom which exhibits both electrophilic and nucleophilic characters.53 As a consequence of the nonspherical atomic
charge distribution among halogen atoms, the interhalogen bond (especially
Cl···Cl bond) occurs, which is systematically explained
by Price et al.54 Weak Cl···O
interaction was coined in organic chemistry in the year 1950, and
in recent years, it has been used extensively for building supramolecular
assemblies in crystal engineering.55

The importance of halogen bond interactions in the pharmaceutical
industry is that we can exploit these interactions in the design of
new pharmaceutical drug products with definable structural and biological
properties. A significant number of new drug molecules in the clinical
development are halogenated compounds.56 The incorporation of the halogen atoms in the new drug molecules
could lead to an increase in the permeability of the molecules, thereby
increasing their oral bioavailability.57−59 A few cocrystals/salts
are designed and synthesized based on the halogen bond interactions.60−62 The first example of a pharmaceutical cocrystal involving halogen
bonds as a major interaction was reported by Baldrighi et al. in the
year 2013, wherein an antimicrobial drug 3-iodo-2-propynyl-N-butylcarbamate (IPBC) has been chosen as the key molecule.63 Better physicochemical properties such as powder
flowability and thermal stability were obtained for the cocrystal
compared to those of the parent IPBC.

2-Chloro-4-nitrobenzoic
acid (2c4n) is a derivative of benzoic
acid which contains one electrophilic substituent and one labile group.
This compound and most of its isomers (namely, 5-chloro-4-nitrobenzoic
acid) are used as antiviral agents64 in
the pharmaceutical field. They are useful in the treatment of HIV
infection and boost the immune response in immune deficiency diseases.65 In the last two decades, numerous cocrystals/salts
of 2c4n have been reported. Ishida et al. synthesized a series of
cocrystals and salts of 2c4n with N-containing heterocycles. These
include (2c4n)2·(pyrazine),66 (2c4n)·(2,4,6-trimethyl pyridine),67 (2c4n)·(3-cyanopyridine),68 (2c4n)·(1,2,3-benzotriazole),69 (2c4n)·(4-benzoylpyridine),70 and (2c4n)·(quinoline).71 In all reported molecular assemblies, acid···pyridine
heterosynthon was found to be the most robust synthon. 4-Amino pyridine,72 imidazole,73 isopropylideneisonicotinohydrazide,74 and 3,5-lutidine75 were known to form salts with 2c4n using charge-assisted acid···pyridine
hydrogen bonds. Lemmerer et al. synthesized a series of nine cocrystals/salts
of 2c4n with various pyridine derivatives such as 2-bromopyridine,
3-amino-2-bromopyridine, 3-amino-2-chloropyridine, 2-amino-5-nitropyridine,
2-amino-3-bromopyridine, 2-chloro-3-hydroxypyridine, 2-amino-5-bromopyridine,
2,6-dimethylpyridine, and 2-amino-5-chloropyridine.76 Further, solvates and polymorphic phase transformation
of 2c4n were reported by Aitipamula et al. in the year 2011.77

The interaction of carboxylic acid with
pyridine nitrogen includes
conventional and nonconventional hydrogen bonds and has been extensively
studied in the design of various supramolecular nanostructures such
as rosettes, rods, layers, tapes, sheets, ribbons, and sphere aggregates.78−80 Although numerous reports on cocrystals/salts of 2c4n are reported,
the presence of weak secondary interactions, especially the presence
of halogen bonds, and their importance in crystal packing were not
illustrated much in the literature. Further, reports on the salt formation
in the presence of other competing functionalities (carboxylic acid)
are fewer in the literature. Hence, it is interesting to explore synthon
formation when diverse functional groups are present that compete
for synthon formation. Studies pertaining to the product formation
in the presence of competitive functional groups such as amine (−NH2) are relatively sparse. Hence, heterocyclic amines have been
chosen as well for studying the salt formation.

In this regard,
an attempt was made to synthesize the molecular
salts of 2c4n with various benzoic acid and pyridyl derivatives based
on the pKa values of 2c4n and the salt formers. The salt
formers used are 2-aminobenzoic acid, 3-aminobenzoic acid, 4-aminobenzoic
acid, 2-aminothiazole, 2-aminobenzimidazole, 2-aminopyrimidine, 2-aminopyridine,
and 3-aminopyridine (Scheme 1). Further, the present work aims to study and understand
the nature of weak secondary interactions involved in the molecular
salts, especially halogen bonds, and compare these nonbonded interactions
with the reported salts/cocrystals of 2c4n to infer the presence of
halogen bonds in these supramolecular architectures.

Results and Discussion
Crystal
Structure of Molecular Salts
2c4n.a
The asymmetric unit in the
molecular salt contains
one molecule each of 2c4n and 2-aminobenzoic acid which was crystallized
in a triclinic crystal system with the space group P1̅. The proton transfer from a carboxylic acid of 2c4n to 2-aminobenzoic
acid was observed with a N–H···O bond distance
of 2.734 Å (∠164.40°) (Figure 1a). Two neighboring supramolecular units
are interconnected through a N–H···O hydrogen
bond (2.756 Å) between the amine group and the carboxylate of
2c4n, resulting in a cyclic tetrameric unit with an R42 (8) graph set
(Figure 1b). This tetrameric
unit further self-assembled through a complementary bifurcated N–H···O
hydrogen bond (2.987 Å) and an −O–H···O
hydrogen bond (2.521 Å) between the acid group of 2-aminobenzoic
acid and the carboxylate of 2c4n, resulting in a linear one-dimensional
(1D) tape (Figure 2). The 1D structure is further converted to three-dimensional (3D)
by utilizing a weak C–H···O hydrogen bond (3.239
Å) between aromatic C–H of 2c4n and O of the carboxylate
of 2-aminobenzoic acid (Figure 3). The crystallographic data and the hydrogen bond parameters
are displayed in Tables 1 and 2.

2c4n.b
Salt 2c4n.b is crystallized
in a triclinic crystal
system with the P1̅ space group, and the asymmetric
unit contains two ion pairs of 2c4n and 3-aminobenzoic acid along
with one molecule of water (Figure 4). In the first instance, one molecule of 3-aminobenzoic
acid interacted with one molecule each of 2c4n and 3-aminobenzoic
acid through a −N–H···O hydrogen bond
(3.029 and 2.787 Å, respectively) and a C–H···O
hydrogen bond (3.165 Å); second, a 3-aminobenzoic acid molecule
involved in a hydrogen bond with a water molecule with a −N–H···O
bond distance of 2.776 Å. The water molecule further forms a
hydrogen bond with the oxygen of 4-nitro group of 2c4n with an O–H···O
bond distance of 2.973 Å. These molecular units further self-assembled
through strong N–H···O and weak C–H···Cl
and C–H···O hydrogen bonds, resulting in a two-dimensional
(2D) network of the 2c4n.b salt (Figure 5). The unit repeats to form a 3D network
which is stabilized by the π–π interaction between
2c4n and 3-aminobenzoic acid with a centroid–centroid distance
of 3.636 Å (Figure 6).

2c4n.c
This molecular salt is crystallized in an orthorhombic
crystal system with the space group Pbca, and the
asymmetric unit contains one molecule each of 2c4n and 4-aminobenzoic
acid (Figure 7a). The
primary synthon was found to be N+–H···O– heterosynthon with a distance of 2.828 Å. These
supramolecular units are connected to the neighboring units through
three different complementary N–H···O hydrogen
bonds (2.788, 2.825, and 3.229 Å), resulting in the cyclic tetrameric
unit (Figure 7b). These
units further repeat to form a 1D sheet (Figure 8) via a C–H···O hydrogen
bond (between two 2c4n molecules) and an O–H···O
hydrogen bond (between two 4-aminobenzoic acid molecules). It is further
converted to a 3D ladder kind of arrangement that is stabilized by
the π–π interaction between 2c4n and 4-aminobenzoic
acid with a centroid–centroid distance of 3.615 Å (Figure 9).

2c4n.d
The product
is crystallized in a triclinic crystal
system with the space group P1̅ with one molecule
each of 2c4n and 2-aminothiazole in the asymmetric unit. The primary
interaction is the N+–H (azole)···O– (carboxylate) hydrogen bond (2.634 Å, ∠173.9°)
and N–H···O hydrogen bond (2.846 Å, ∠162.45°)
between 2c4n and 2-aminothiazole (Figure 10a). Two neighboring supramolecular adducts
are interconnected through a strong complementary N–H···O
hydrogen bond (2.892 Å) and a weak Cl···S halogen
bond (3.405 Å), resulting in a cyclic tetrameric unit with R42 (8) ring motifs
(Figure 10b). The
tetramers are interconnected to form a 1D and then a 2D chain along
the b axis via Cl···S and Cl···O
halogen bonds (3.405 and 3.102 Å, respectively) and a S···O
chalcogen bond (3.016 Å) (Figures 11 and 12). These further
recur to form a 3D network that is stabilized by a C–H (azole)···O
(carboxylate) hydrogen bond (3.339 Å).

2c4n.e
2c4n.e
is crystallized in a monoclinic crystal
system with the space group P21/c. The asymmetric unit contains one molecule each of 2c4n
and the 2-aminobenzimidazolium ion (Figure 13). The proton transfer was observed from
2c4n to the imidazole nitrogen of 2-aminobenzimidazole. Each of the
carboxylate oxygen of 2c4n is involved in a hydrogen bond with the
imidazole via N+–H (imidazole)···O– (2.759 Å, ∠172.99°) and N–H
(amine)···O– hydrogen bonds (2.859
Å, ∠156.37°). The dimers are connected to each other
through a N–H (imidazole)···O– hydrogen bond (2.703 Å) and a Cl···O halogen
bond (3.205 Å) on the other side that recurs to form a V-shaped
network (Figure 14). The overall crystal structure features weak secondary interactions
such as a C–H···O hydrogen bond (3.532 Å)
between two 2c4n molecules and a C–H···O hydrogen
bond (3.410 Å) between aromatic C–H of 2-aminobenzimidazole
and the nitro group of 2c4n (Figure 15).

2c4n.f
The product is crystallized
in a triclinic crystal
system with the space group P1̅, and the asymmetric
unit comprised one molecule each of 2c4n anion and 2-amino pyrimidinium
cation. The primary synthon in the crystal structure comprised N+–H (pyrimidine)···O– (carboxylate of 2c4n) and N–H (amine of 2-aminopyrimidine)···O– (carboxylate) hydrogen bonds with bond distances of
2.602 and 2.823 Å, respectively (Figure 16). It is further interconnected to the neighboring
unit via a complementary N–H···N hydrogen bond
(3.036 Å) to form a heterodimer. These units repeat to form a
1D linear chain mediated by a C–H···O hydrogen
bond between 2c4n molecules (3.355 Å) (Figure 17). It is further converted to a 3D structure
by utilizing a weak C–H···Cl hydrogen bond (3.695
Å) and a C–H···O hydrogen bond between
the oxygen of the nitro group of 2c4n and C–H of the 2-aminopyrimidine
molecule. The overall crystal structure also features the π–π
interaction between 2-aminopyridine molecules with a centroid-to-centroid
bond distance of 3.409 Å (Figure 18).

2c4n.g
A 1:1 molecular salt of 2c4n
and 2-aminopyridine
was obtained and is crystallized in the triclinic space group P1̅. In the crystal structure, the asymmetric unit
contains two crystallographically independent molecules, each of 2c4n
and 2-aminopyridine. The primary synthon is a two-point supramolecular
synthon which is assembled through a charge-assisted complementary
hydrogen bond between carboxylic acid and aminopyridine moiety, resulting
in a dimeric unit (2.743 Å) (Figure 19). Adjacent dimers are further linked through
a self-complementary N–H···O (2.823 Å)
hydrogen bond to form cyclic heterotetramers. These heterotetramers
are mediated by a secondary C–H···O (3.229 Å)
interaction to form a supramolecular 1D column (Figure 20). The 1D column is interconnected
to the neighboring column through a secondary C–H···O
interaction involving C–H of the pyridine ring and the oxygen
of the nitro group of 2c4n to form a 2D supramolecular sheetlike structure
(Figure 21). The dimensionality
of the supramolecular structure of 2c4n.g increased by a weak Cl···Cl
interaction. The supramolecular sheets are interconnected to the neighboring
ones in a vertical plane through a Cl···Cl halogen
bond (3.481 Å) (Figure 22).

2c4n.h
2c4n and
3-aminopyridine afforded a crystalline
salt in a 1:1 ratio which is crystallized in a triclinic crystal system
with the space group P1̅. The asymmetric unit
of the salt contains one 3-aminopyridine cation and one 2c4n anion.
The primary synthon is a single-point supramolecular synthon in which
a proton from the carboxylic group is transferred to the pyridine
nitrogen atom with a N–H···O bond distance of
2.615 Å (Figure 23). The proton transfer from the acid to the N atom of pyridine is
reflected by an increase in the C–N–C bond angle (123.44°)
compared to that of the neutral molecule (117.7°–118.5°).
The two neighboring ion pairs are linked through complementary N–H···O
(2.935 Å) hydrogen bonds to form a cyclic heterotetramer. These
heterotetramers are further combined through N–H···O
hydrogen bonds (2.873 Å) to form a 1D column (Figure 24). These supramolecular 1D
columns are interconnected to the neighboring column through a secondary
C–H···O hydrogen bond (3.239 Å) which results
in a 2D supramolecular sheet (Figure 25). Similar to salt 2c4n.g, the dimensionality of the
crystal structure of 2c4n.h is increased by a weak Cl···Cl
interaction. The supramolecular columns are interconnected to the
neighboring columns through a chlorine–chlorine interaction
with a Cl···Cl distance of 3.305 Å (Figure 26).

Role of Halogen Bonds in
the Present Work and the Reported Salts/Cocrystals
of 2c4n in Building a Supramolecular Network
Among the 24
reported molecular adducts and 8 synthesized molecular salts of 2c4n,
only 12 and 4 molecular salts/cocrystals exhibited halogen bonds in
their crystal structures. Molecular structures of the reported salts/coformers
of 2c4n are shown in Scheme 2. Conformational changes in the carboxylate group were observed
in the synthesized molecular salts and in the reported molecular adducts
of 2c4n as well. Synthesized molecular salts such as 2c4n.d, 2c4n.e,
2c4n.g, and 2c4n.h exhibited halogen bonds in their crystal structures,
which along with hydrogen bonds are responsible for the overall crystal
stability of the molecular salts. However, the crystal structures
of the remaining salts were stabilized via C–H···Cl
and C–H···O hydrogen bonds except for the 2c4n.a
salt, where chlorine was not involved in the intermolecular bond formation.
It is worth noticing that the synthesized as well as the reported
molecular adducts showed a similar kind of conformational change for
the adducts involving halogen bonds in their crystal structures, whereas
the conformation was found to be slightly twisted in the rest of the
salts to attain the stable forms (Figure 27). Torsion angles of the synthesized molecular
salts of 2c4n are listed in the Supporting Information (Table S1).

and yellow: 2c4n.h).

Scheme 2 Molecular Structures of the Salt Formers/Coformers Reported
with
2c4n
Attempts have been made to
systematically study the presence of
halogen bonds in the 24 reported molecular adducts and 8 synthesized
salts. Efforts were made to correlate the presence of halogen bonds
in these crystal structures with the arrangement of molecules in the
crystal lattice. Further, the effect of substituent groups in the
counterion molecule was studied. It was observed that the molecular
components interacted through a two-point primary supramolecular synthon
rather than a single-point supramolecular synthon in the crystal structure
(Figure 28) were more
likely to exhibit halogen bonds. However, there were exceptions where
the molecular salt/cocrystal was found to be stabilized via a C–H···Cl
hydrogen bond rather than a halogen bond. It was further understood
that stronger intramolecular halogen bonds in 2c4n are more susceptible
to form intermolecular halogen bonds (Table 3). Lommerse et al.81 defined the parameter R to bring interacting halogen
bond distances into a standardized scale, which is given by  where d is the X–D
distance and rx and rd are the standard van der Waals radii of the participating
atoms. The parameter R for the molecular adducts
that exhibited halogen bonds is listed in Table 4.

to show the exact interaction distances (like Cl···Br
and Cl···N).

From Table 4, it
is clear that quite strong Cl···O, Br···O,
and Cl···N halogen bonds with R values
of 0.94, 0.93, and 0.93 were formed in the molecular adducts of 2c4n
with 3-aminopyridne, 2-amino-5-bromopyridine, and nicotinamide, respectively.
A moderately strong halogen bond was observed in the cases of 2c4n.d,
2c4n.h, 2-amino-5-nitropyridne, bipyridine, lutidine, and quinoline
adducts of 2c4n. In the remaining molecular adducts, only weaker halogen
bond interactions were observed which is attributed to a higher R value.

Significance of the pKa Value as
a Tool to Predict Cocrystals or Salts
The prediction of formation
of salts or cocrystals is one of the major challenges before crystal
engineering.89 Earlier literature suggested
that the proton transfer from the acid to a nitrogen atom of the N-heterocyclic
compound occurs based on the difference in the pKa values of acid and the conjugate acid of the N-heterocyclic
base. Proton transfer will occur when ΔpKa > 3, whereas cocrystal will form for ΔpKa < 3. There is an ambiguity in the region 0 < ΔpKa < 3, where the probability of formation
of salts increases as the ΔpKa increases.90−94 However, in reality, the pKa value of
acids and bases is bound to vary based on the chosen solvent and other
components associated with the reaction. As a result, it is difficult
to predict the nature of the resultant compounds.

The ΔpKa values for various reported salt formers used
with 2c4n are shown in Table 5. In general, it is expected that cocrystal formation is predominant
when ΔpKa < 0 and salt formation
is predominant when ΔpKa is greater
than 3. A similar trend is observed in the reported molecular adducts
of 2c4n. In most of the cases, salt formation is observed when the
ΔpKa lies above 3 units. However,
in few cases, cocrystal formation is observed if the ΔpKa value is close to 3 units, as shown in Table 5. Cocrystal formation
is found to be predominant when the ΔpKa lies below 0 units. Therefore, the region in between 0 and
3 (ΔpKa) is considered as a salt–cocrystal
continuum.90−94

to the ΔD (the difference between the lengths
of the two C–O bonds in a carboxyl group) bond length. The
ΔD value for a cocrystal is found to be high;
therefore, the top left corner of the scatter plot corresponds to
cocrystal formation and the bottom right corner corresponds to salt
formation. A similar kind of scattergram plot is reported in the literature
as well.95

Thermal Study
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)
analysis was performed to study the thermal stability of the synthesized
molecular salts. Salts with benzoic acid derivatives (2c4n.a, 2c4n.b,
and 2c4n.c) melt in between/nearly equal to the melting temperatures
of 2c4n and salt formers. No correlation of the melting point of these
salts with the crystal density is observed. In 2c4n.b and 2c4n.c,
phase transformation was observed which is possibly due to the existence
of polymorphism in these salts. A higher melting temperature was observed
for the pyridine derivative salt of 2c4n when compared to its respective
starting materials. The melting points of 2c4n and the salts are shown
in Table 6. Because
of the isostructurality of 2c4n.g and 2c4n.h, their densities and
melting temperatures were found to be approximately similar. It is
surprising that the melting temperature of 2c4n.e was found to be
higher when compared to those of all other synthesized salts even
though the crystal density was low, which indicates the high thermal
stability of salt 2c4n.e. It is further observed that a higher melting
temperature was observed for those salts that exhibited halogen bonds
in their crystal structures. DSC thermogram is displayed in the Supporting Information Figure S1.

Fourier Transform Infrared
Spectroscopy
Generally,
IR spectroscopy is used to identify the functional group present in
the molecule. It also gives information about the hydrogen bonds present
in the molecule. Salt formation can be confirmed by observing changes
in the carbonyl stretching frequency as the ionization causes a reduction
in the carbonyl stretching frequency. On the basis of the changes
in these stretching frequencies, we ascertained the formation of new
solid forms. −C=O stretching frequency for 2c4n was
observed at 1704 cm–1. In all molecular salts, ionization
caused a large shift in the carbonyl stretching frequency for pyridyl
derivative salts; however, in the case of benzoic acid derivative
salts, a considerable shift in the stretching frequency was observed.
The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra and the stretching
values are shown in the Supporting Information (Figures S10–S17 and Table S2).

Powder X-ray Diffraction
Analysis
Powder X-ray diffraction
(PXRD) analysis is the prerequisite for the confirmation of formation
of new molecular components. In the present study, PXRD analysis is
carried out to confirm the bulk purity of the synthesized molecular
salts. All synthesized molecular salts were found to be pure in the
bulk. The PXRD pattern is shown in the Supporting Information (Figures S2–S9).

1H NMR Spectroscopy
All synthesized molecular
salts exhibited a 1:1 molecular stoichiometry in their asymmetric
unit. The 1H NMR spectra and the spectral details are given
in the Supporting Information (Figures
S18–S25).

Conclusions
In summary, a series
of eight molecular salts of 2c4n have been
synthesized in view of studying the presence of halogen bonds in the
molecular salts/cocrystals of 2c4n. Four synthesized molecular salts
and 12 out of 24 reported molecular adducts of 2c4n were found to
exhibit halogen bonds in their crystal structures. The synthesized
molecular salts were characterized by various spectroscopic, thermal,
and X-ray diffraction techniques. In all synthesized salts, proton
transfer from the carboxylic acid group to the pyridyl nitrogen/amino
group was observed. All synthesized salts were found to be anhydrous
except for 2c4n.b, which is monohydrate. Conformational analysis of
the synthesized and the reported molecular salts revealed that 2c4n
exhibited two different conformations in the molecular adducts; a
similar kind of conformation was observed for the salts exhibiting
halogen bonds in their crystal structures. Two of the synthesized
molecular salts were found to be isostructural as well (2c4n.g and
2c4n.h). In the synthesized and the reported molecular adducts of
2c4n, the acid···pyridine heterosynthon was found to
be the robust. Detailed inspection of the reported and the synthesized
molecular adducts of 2c4n revealed that two-point primary supramolecular
synthon and stronger intramolecular Cl···O halogen
bonds in the crystal structures are more prone to exhibit halogen
bonds in their crystal structures. From the single-crystal X-ray diffraction
(SC-XRD) study, it is strongly suggested that two-point heterosynthon
is more likely to exhibit halogen bonds though the conformational
change of the carboxylate group of 2c4n occurs. Halogen bonds played
a major role in the crystal packing of these molecular adducts, based
on the SC-XRD study.

An empirical absorption correction was applied to the collected reflections
with SADABS. All structures were solved by direct methods using SHELXS97
and SHELXL2007/2014, and refinement was carried out by the full-matrix
least-squares technique. Anisotropic displacement parameters were
calculated for all nonhydrogen atoms. H atoms attached to the N atoms
were located in a difference Fourier density map and refined isotropically.
The program PLATON96 was used to generate
the hydrogen bond table, whereas MERCURY was used for all graphical
representations of the results.

1H NMR Spectroscopy
1H NMR spectrum
is recorded on a Bruker BioSpin 500 MHz/400 MHz spectrometer (Bruker,
Germany). 1H NMR provides information related to the molecular
structure and the stoichiometry in the crystal lattice. 1H NMR was recorded in a DMSO-d6 solvent
with tetramethylsilane as the internal reference standard (δ
= 0). For the analysis, approximately 5–10 mg of the samples
was dissolved in a DMSO-d6 solvent and
the spectra were recorded with 16 numbers of scans. MestReNova 7.0.0.8331
software was used to process the raw NMR data.

Powder X-ray Diffraction
PXRD was recorded on a JEOL
JDX-8 PXRD instrument in the scan range of 2θ = 5°–50°.
For a typical experiment, samples were placed on the standard sample
holder and then scanned continuously at a scan rate of 2° min–1.

Infrared Spectroscopy
FT-IR spectra
were recorded on
a Nicolet Avatar 330 instrument in the scan range of 400–4000
cm–1. In a typical experiment, approximately 10–15
mg of the samples was mixed with KBr, ground well using a mortar,
and pressed with a steel die into a pellet. The FT-IR spectra were
collected for 16 scans at a resolution of 4 cm–1.

Differential Scanning Calorimetry
DSC analysis was
performed on a DSC 60 differential scanning calorimeter (Shimadzu,
Japan) which was calibrated for temperature and enthalpy using a Tin
standard material. For the analysis, 2–5 mg of the samples
was placed into an aluminum pan, and it was covered with a crimped
lid. This weighed, crimped aluminum pan was kept in the sample reference
cell and scanned from 30 to 350 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min
under a continuously purged dry nitrogen atmosphere.
