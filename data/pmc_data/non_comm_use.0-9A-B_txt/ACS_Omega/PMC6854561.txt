Poor low-temperature
catalytic activity and durability are the
main drawbacks of palladium-based catalysts for methane combustion.
Herein, stable and active PdO particles are constructed by incorporating
Ti into an alumina support, which makes the catalysts exhibit satisfactory
methane combustion activity. The results of comprehensive characterization
reveal that an appropriate amount of Ti doping induces the optimization
of electron transfer and distribution, thus contributing to the construction
and stabilization of active PdO lattices. The reactive oxygen mobility
is improved and the optimal PdO/Pd0 combination is achieved,
thanks to the amplified PdO–support interaction. In addition,
the acid–base properties are regulated and Brønsted acid
sites are generated by virtue of the adjustment of electronic properties,
which facilitate stabilization of PdO as well. Hence, the Ti-containing
catalyst exhibits superior activity for methane oxidation at low temperatures.
Notably, the activity and cyclic performance of the catalyst can be
further enhanced when undergoing long-term and isothermal heat treatment
under the reactant stream and methane, and it demonstrates a high
performance with 90% CH4 conversion at 340 °C.

1 Introduction
Natural
gas, a clean and efficient fuel, is gradually displacing
diesel or gasoline in vehicles.1−3 Due to incomplete combustion,
the tail gases emitted from natural gas vehicles always contain residual
methane, which would cause a serious greenhouse effect.4,5 Catalytic combustion of methane is an effective way to reduce methane
emission and also an important issue with respect to environmental
sustainability. Nevertheless, the temperature of tail gases is relatively
low (300–500 °C) during the vehicle cold-start period;
therefore, the activity and thermal stability of catalysts at low
temperatures should be improved to reach a high combustion efficiency.6−8

Methane combustion catalysts mainly include noble metals,9−13 perovskites,14 and hexaaluminates.15 Among them, noble metal catalysts, especially
Pd-based catalysts, are one of the most active catalysts for methane
combustion.16,17 Their catalytic activity depends
strongly on the nature of the support, oxidation state, and stability
of palladium species as well as the interaction with the support.18,19 Although it is demonstrated that the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst is active in the methane combustion reaction, maintaining
low-temperature (<400 °C) activity and improving the stability
and efficiency of PdO particles still remain challenging subjects.20 So far, the addition of metals or nonmetals
into a support has been widely accepted as a promising way to solve
these problems. Recently, our research group successfully incorporated
phosphorus into an alumina support, which changed the acidity of the
support, adjusted the distribution of palladium species, and modified
the reduction properties of catalysts, and thus enhanced the low-temperature
activity and hydrothermal stability of catalysts for methane combustion.21 Zou22 presented a
facile way to stabilize the performance of Pd/Al2O3 by producing a spinel NiAl2O4 interface,
which promoted the distribution of PdO and further inhibited the aggregation
of PdO nanoparticles during the reaction. In addition, Venezia et
al.23 modified the methane combustion activity
of supported palladium catalysts by incorporating titanium dioxide
into an SiO2 support, proposing that the Si–O–Ti
bonds in the mixed oxides were responsible for the enhanced activity.
As a reducible oxide and oxygen carrier, TiO2 can enhance
the reducibility and oxygen mobility of the supported palladium oxide
for methane activation.24 However, the
specific surface area of TiO2 is usually low; thus, we
envisaged that the introduction of titanium dioxide into mesoporous
γ-Al2O3 may construct a support with relatively
high surface area and oxygen transfer ability simultaneously, and
the composition and properties of the catalysts may be further optimized.

Active palladium species and the interaction with supports are
well known to be crucial for the activity and stability of Pd-based
catalysts. During the methane combustion reaction, the PdO ↔
Pd0 redox cycle follows the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism.22,25 Therefore, the presence of PdO is necessary for enhanced catalytic
activity. Willis et al.10 designed a catalyst
with uniform palladium nanocrystals and systematically described structure–property
relationships, verifying that PdO is the most active phase in catalytic
methane combustion. In addition, Huang et al.26 demonstrated that both Pd0 and PdO were the active sites
under the condition of rich methane combustion (air/fuel < 1),
whereas PdO played a dominant role in lean methane combustion (air/fuel
> 1). Osman et al.27 reported a zeolite-supported
palladium catalyst with strong Brønsted (B-) acidity induced
by the addition of TiO2, enhancing the reoxidation of Pd0 and facilitating the activation of methane. Therefore, the
presence of titanium dioxide and its regulation on the acid–base
properties of catalysts significantly affect the redox performance
of palladium species. Based on the above literature, a reasonable
design of catalysts may contribute to stabilize the active PdO and
strengthen the interaction with supports, which consequently inhibits
the sintering of PdO particles.

Inspired by the above assumption,
an ultrasonic-assisted sol–gel
technology was proposed to facilely prepare Ti-doped mesoporous γ-Al2O3 carriers to construct highly active palladium
catalysts for low-temperature methane combustion. The structure–activity
relationship of the catalysts is systematically investigated: (i)
charge distribution and transfer between the support and palladium
species enhances the metal–support interaction, and thus stabilizes
the PdO particles and optimizes the redox properties of the catalyst.
(ii) The presence of titanium oxide promotes the exchange of active
oxygen species between PdO and the support, which contributes to the
stabilization and utilization of PdO particles as well. (iii) The
acid–base properties of the catalysts are effectively tuned
by doping Ti into the lattice of γ-Al2O3. Overall, the influence of synergistic effects of electronics, active
PdO stability, and acid–base properties of catalysts on methane
combustion performance is discussed in detail.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Catalytic Performance
To determine
the composition of the reactant feed in the activity evaluation, the
influence of the CH4/O2 molar ratio on the catalytic
oxidation of CH4 was investigated over a Pd/15TA catalyst
(Figure S1). In our research, the temperature
at 90% CH4 conversion (T90)
is used as a criterion for evaluating catalytic activity; the lower
the temperature, the better the catalytic performance. It can be found
that the T90 of the catalyst was 435 °C
when the molar ratio of CH4/O2 is 1:5. Then,
the CH4 oxidation activity was enhanced with the CH4/O2 ratio increasing from 1:5 to 1:7.5 (T90 = 425 °C) and even to 1:10 (T90 = 410 °C). The reason for such behavior
may be that more of the metallic Pd species are oxidized into PdO
with the increase of O2 concentration,26 providing more active species for methane oxidation. Then
the activity slightly decreases as the oxygen content further increases
to 1:12.5, which may be due to the partial inactivation of Pd species
when covered with excessive oxygen under higher O2 concentration
conditions.28 Therefore, the molar ratio
of CH4/O2 of 1:10 was chosen to carry out the
subsequent activity tests.

The composition–activity relation
of Pd/xTA catalysts for CH4 combustion
under dry conditions was investigated, and the results are presented
in Figure 1a. The activity
profiles demonstrate that the catalytic activity varies with the Ti
content. Among them, the Pd/15TA catalyst exhibits the highest activity
(T90 = 410 °C); the T90 value is decreased by 60 °C compared with that
of the Pd/0TA catalyst (T90 = 470 °C).
However, the activity is no longer improved when the Ti doping content
is higher than 15 wt %. This implies that the catalyst with an appropriate
addition of Ti exhibits the highest catalytic performance. After the
first round of activity test, the Pd/15TA catalyst was chosen to further
explore the stability test at 390 °C (the corresponding conversion
of CH4 was about 80%). As presented in Figure 1b, after a 20 h stability test,
the CH4 conversion was reduced only by 5%, indicating that
the catalyst could maintain good stability during the long-term test.
Subsequently, the Pd/15TA catalyst after the stability test was selected
to investigate the cyclic activity (Figure 1c). As shown in Figure 1c/cycle 1-1, the catalyst is first pretreated
with a methane atmosphere at 400 °C for 30 min by shutting off
oxygen. After that, the catalyst exhibits a remarkably high activity
and T90 is 360 °C, which is lower
than that of the activity test (T90 =
410 °C). And then, the temperature is decreased to 250 °C,
and the second round of the activity test is carried out (without
CH4 pretreatment), the T90 of
which is 370 °C (Figure 1c/cycle 1-2). By analogy, cycles 2 and 3 repeat the process
of cycle 1, and after the third cycle test (cycle 3), the T90 of the catalyst is maintained at 350 °C,
indicating the presentable cyclic activity of Pd/15TA.

Figure 1 (a) Activity evaluation
of Pd/xTA catalysts, (b)
stability test at 390 °C, and (c) cyclic activity test of the
Pd/15TA catalyst under dry conditions. Reaction conditions: 1 vol
% CH4, 10 vol % O2, and N2 equilibrium
gas, gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) = 50 000 mL g–1 h–1.

To further investigate
the low-temperature durability of Ti-containing
catalysts, the Pd/15TA catalyst after cyclic measurements (Figure 1c, cycle 3-2) is
chosen and tested at 290 °C for 10 h. As shown in Figure S2, the CH4 conversion is ∼28%
and decreases slightly to ∼20%. Then, the temperature is increased
and fixed at 310 °C for 60 min, and the CH4 conversion
is enhanced and maintained at ∼40%. In the next cooling–heating
procedure, the CH4 conversion still remains unchanged at
290 and 310 °C, respectively. Subsequently, another cycle of
activity evaluation is performed, and the T90 value further decreases to 340 °C. These results show that
the catalyst possess satisfactory low-temperature stability and cyclic
activity in the methane combustion reaction.

Another factor
affecting the methane combustion of palladium-based
catalysts is the presence of water vapor. Hence, the influence of
H2O on the catalytic activity is evaluated in the presence
of 5 vol % of H2O in the feed. The results shown in Figure 2a indicate that the T90 values of all catalysts are higher than those
under dry conditions (Figure 1a), so we can conclude that the existence of water has a negative
influence on the catalytic activity of all catalysts, which agrees
well with that previously reported.7 The
reason for this kind of inhibition by H2O might be the
formation of inactive Pd(OH)2 from PdO, significantly blocking
the contact of CH4 with the active PdO species, and thus
lowering the activity of the catalyst.29 On the other hand, as compared with the undoped counterpart (T90 = 490 °C), all Ti-containing catalysts
exhibit lower T90 values and higher catalytic
activity, which show the same trend as those under dry conditions
(Figure 1a).

Figure 2 (a) Methane
conversion as a function of temperature over Pd/xTA catalysts and (b) cyclic stability test of the Pd/15TA
catalyst under water conditions. Reaction conditions: 1 vol % CH4, 10 vol % O2, and 5 vol % H2O and N2 equilibrium gas, GHSV = 50 000 mL g–1 h–1.

To further investigate
the hydrothermal stability, the used Pd/15TA
catalyst after the cyclic
measurement under dry conditions is used and evaluated at 350 °C
in the presence of 5 vol % H2O (Figure S3). The CH4 conversion decreases from 87 to 71%
during the 90 min stability test. This may be due to the fact that
at the designated temperature (350 °C) and humidity (5 vol %
H2O), water vapor persists and covers the active palladium
site, blocking the contact of the reaction gas with the active site.29 Thus, there are grounds to foresee that the
activity will continue to decrease as the test time is further prolonged.
It is worth noting that after the hydrothermal stability test the
catalytic activity of Pd/15TA is retained (T90 = 390 °C) in four successive cycles (Figure 2b), indicating the superior
cycling stability under wet conditions. Therefore, even though the
hydrothermal stability of the catalyst needs to be improved, the above-mentioned
results still manifest the high catalytic activity, as well as good
cyclic and long-term stability (under dry conditions) of the Ti-containing
catalyst (Pd/15TA), which demonstrate its competitive application
potential for methane combustion in comparison to the reported palladium-based
catalysts (Table S1).

2.2 Structural Properties of Catalysts
2.2.1 N2 Physisorption Measurements
Figure S4 represents the nitrogen adsorption–desorption
isotherms of Pd/xTA catalysts, showing a typical
IV isotherm with a H1 hysteresis loop, which implies a uniform mesoporous
structure.30 The loops for the samples
with Ti content exceeding 15 wt % shift to a higher relative pressure,
indicating a significant increase in the pore size,31 as shown in Table S2. Besides,
compared with the undoped one, the catalyst doped with 5 wt % Ti has
a slightly higher Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface
area (SBET = 225 m2 g–1), whereas the SBET decreases when the
Ti content exceeds 5 wt %. Considering that the specific surface area
of the catalysts after Ti doping is reduced, and the activity is enhanced
compared to that of Pd/0TA, we may reasonably conclude that the specific
surface area and pore distribution are not the main influences on
catalytic performance.

2.2.2 X-ray Diffraction (XRD)
Patterns
XRD patterns of the Pd/xTA catalysts
before and
after the activity test are shown in Figure 3. The diffraction peaks at 2θ = 20.2,
32.3, 37.1, 39.4, 45.8, 60.7, and 66.8° are assigned to the (111),
(220), (311), (222), (400), (511), and (440) reflections of γ-Al2O3 (JCPDS 10-0425), respectively. For Ti-containing
catalysts (10–25 wt %), the peaks at 2θ = 27.3, 36.1,
54.3, 56.4, and 68.8° are attributed to the rutile TiO2.32 And, the characteristic peaks at 2θ
= 33.8 and 55° are ascribed to PdO.33 For the fresh catalysts, there are no PdO peaks detected in Pd/0TA
and Pd/5TA; however, the two peaks appear apparently after the activity
test due to the occurrence of structural rearrangements.8 Notably, when the Ti doping exceeds 10%, the
PdO peaks of fresh Pd/xTA (x = 15–25)
catalysts are detected and remain unchanged after the activity testing.
Moreover, the peak intensity of PdO on the Pd/15TA catalyst after
cyclic tests remains unchanged as well (Figure 3d, purple line), confirming the satisfactory
stability of PdO particles. Combined with the results of activity
tests, it can be concluded that the appropriate doping amount of Ti
results in more PdO species in the catalyst, with higher dispersion
and stability.

2.2.3 Transmission Electron
Microscopy (TEM) Analysis
of Catalyst
Based on the highest catalytic activity for methane
combustion, the Pd/15TA catalyst was chosen to conduct the high-angle
annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM)
and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), which obviously illustrate
the phase distribution. As shown in Figure 4a,b, the PdO particles homogeneously distribute
over the Ti-doped support, and the mass fraction of palladium on the
selected area is about 0.51 wt % (Figure 4b). EDS maps of Al, O, Ti, and Pd of the
catalyst are shown in Figure 4c and further demonstrate the phase distribution in the Pd/15TA
catalyst. The HRTEM images shown in Figure 4d–f provide more intuitive evidence
for the size of Pd particles. It can be seen that the Pd species are
distributed on the carrier with a size of 3–5 nm. Besides,
interplanar distances of both PdO(110) plane (d =
0.26 nm) and (101) plane (d = 0.21 nm) can also be
observed from Figures S5 and 4e, respectively, indicating the presence of PdO.

2.3 Chemical and Electronic States
2.3.1 O2-Temperature-Programmed Oxidation
(TPO) and H2-Temperature-Programmed Reduction (TPR) Tests
O2-TPO profiles of Pd/xTA catalysts
are presented in Figure 5a and show the peaks of O2-release owing to PdO decomposition
during the heating process and O2-uptake from the reoxidation
of Pd0 during the cooling process. In comparison with other
catalysts, the Pd/15TA catalyst shows the highest PdO decomposition
temperature during the heating process, which demonstrates the best
thermal stability of the PdO particles and is responsible for the
highest activity of Pd/15TA.34,35 When the doping amount
of Ti exceeds 15 wt %, in addition to the peak of oxygen desorption
centered at 673.8 and 683.7 °C for Pd/20TA and Pd/25TA, respectively,
there is a weak peak at about 740 °C appearing in both samples,
which indicates that the oxygen adsorption states are obviously affected
by the doping amount of Ti. Upon comparing the decomposition peak
areas of O2-release shown in Table S3, the result manifests that the amount of oxygen released
increases with increasing Ti doping amount up to 15 wt %, resulting
from the increase in PdO content, thus facilitating the participation
of PdO species in the methane oxidation reaction eventually. Furthermore,
the temperature of O2-uptake peaks formed from Pd0 reoxidation shifts to a higher position with the increase of Ti
content, that is, Ti doping reduces the difference between the decomposition
temperature of PdO and the reoxidation temperature of Pd0 over the catalysts, especially over Pd/xTA (x = 10–25). It can be reasonably concluded that the
redox cycle between PdO and Pd0 can easily proceed with
the increase of Ti doping and that the addition of an appropriate
amount of Ti ensures a suitable redox cycle. This can be attributed
to the enhanced oxygen mobility induced by the addition of titanium
oxide,24 which facilitates the redox cycle
between PdO and Pd0, realizing the conversion of CH4.

Figure 5 (a) O2-TPO and (b) H2-TPR profiles of Pd/xTA catalysts.

Normally, the PdO species
are regarded as the active sites;7,8,21 however, metallic Pd is reported
to play important roles in the methane catalytic combustion as well.36,37 So, H2-TPR was conducted to elucidate the effect of the
PdO ↔ Pd redox cycle on the performance of catalysts. As shown
in Figure 5b, the Pd/0TA
catalyst shows that the reduction peak of finely dispersed PdO is
located at 130 °C, which is consistent with the results reported
in the literature.38 The peak appearing
at 410 °C is attributed to the reduction of subsurface palladium
species,39 and the broad peak located at
800–900 °C is due to the reduction of bulk oxygen.40 Notably, the Pd/15TA catalyst exhibits the lowest
reduction temperature of PdO (ca. 75 °C) relative to other catalysts,
indicating that the addition of an appropriate amount of Ti could
facilitate the reduction of PdO owing to the strong interaction between
PdO and the Ti-doped support.41 This strong
interaction contributes to the migration of reactive oxygen species
between the palladium species and the support, and the best redox
ability of palladium is conducive to the combustion of methane. So,
we suggest that the favorable PdO ↔ Pd redox cycle contributes
to catalytic methane combustion. In addition, the PdO reduction temperature
of the catalysts increases after excessive Ti doping. Combined with
O2-TPO profiles, it can be concluded that excessive Ti
doping is detrimental to the redox performance of the catalysts and
the stability of PdO. Therefore, the activity of the catalysts is
no longer improved.

2.3.2 X-ray Photoelectron Spectra
(XPS) Analysis
Figure S6a shows
the XPS spectra of
Ti 2p at 458.6 and 464.4 eV corresponding to Ti 2p3/2 and
Ti 2p1/2, respectively.42 For
the Ti-doped catalysts, the binding energy (BE) of Ti 2p3/2 gradually shifts to a lower position with increasing Ti content.
This phenomenon can be related to the incorporation of some Ti species
into the matrix of Al2O3 and then the formation
of Ti–O–Al bonds.42 And the
doping of Ti leads to an increase in negative charge in the vicinity
of Al3+ because of the excess oxygen around it, thus decreasing
the binding energy of Al 2p (Figure S6b). The chemical states of palladium on the surface of Pd/xTA catalysts are presented in Figure 6a. The Pd 3d5/2 BEs within the
range of 337.3–337.7 eV are ascribed to Pd2+, whereas
the BEs at 335.9–336.3 eV are assigned to Pd0.43,44 From Table 1, the
doping of Ti increases the proportion of PdO in the catalysts. And
the Pd/15TA catalyst shows satisfactory catalytic activity, maybe
due to the suitable Pd2+/Pd0 ratio (Pd2+/Pd0 = 1.22).

Figure 6 (a) Pd 3d and (b) O 1s XPS spectra of Pd/xTA catalysts.

Table 1 XPS Analyses
of Pd 3d5/2 and O 1s for Pd/xTA Catalysts

Pd/20TA	44.1	55.9	1.27	1.55	
Pd/25TA	43.0	57.0	1.33	1.27	
In addition to the
chemical states of the catalyst, the distribution
of oxygen species in the catalyst is also an important factor affecting
the catalytic activity. The BEs at 529.7–530.0 eV are ascribed
to the lattice oxygen (Olatt) of the catalysts (Figure 6b). The BEs at 530.7–531.0
eV belong to surface-adsorbed oxygen (Oads), and that at
531.7–532.3 eV are assigned to hydroxyl groups and adsorbed
water molecules (OOH).41 In
general, the reactivity of oxygen atoms on the surface of a catalyst
is related to the thermodynamic affinity to the H atoms. Notably,
Oads exhibits better affinity to H and higher mobility,16,45 which is more effective for H-extraction during the C–H activation
process. In contrast, OOH groups block the oxygen migration
and exchange between PdO and the support by transforming PdO into
inactive Pd(OH)2, resulting in the deactivation of catalysts.
As shown in Table 1, there are more Oads and fewer OOH species
in the Pd/15TA catalyst. However, excessive Ti doping can induce more
OOH, which is not beneficial to catalytic methane combustion.
As shown in Figure S7 and Table 1, compared with the fresh one,
the Pd/15TA catalyst after the activity test (Pd/15TA-used) still
maintains the appropriate Pd2+/Pd0 ratio (Pd2+/Pd0 = 1.17). This evidences that the active palladium
species (PdO/Pd0) maintain a good redox cycle due to the
presence of TiO2 as an oxygen carrier during the reaction
process. As a result, an optimal distribution combination of PdO and
Pd0 may benefit the activity and cyclic performance of
the catalyst.

2.3.3 CO-Diffuse Reflectance
Infrared Fourier
Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and UV–vis Diffuse Reflectance
(DR) Spectroscopy
In the methane combustion reaction, CO
is regarded as a key intermediate affecting the reaction process.
So, adsorption of CO on Pd/xTA catalysts was studied
by in situ DRIFTS. As shown in Figure 7a, a strong band at 1917 cm–1 is
assigned to bridge-bonded CO on the Pd(111) plane.46 Compared with that of Pd/0TA, the band at 1917 cm–1 of Pd/xTA (x = 5–15) is
located at a higher position, especially for the Pd/15TA catalyst,
resulting from the weak adsorption of CO because the adjustment of
the electronic structure and chemical states of the palladium species
contribute to a strong interaction between the palladium species and
the support, as concluded from the XPS spectra. The other two bands
at 2083 and 2120 cm–1 are attributed to atop-bonded
CO on the Pd0(111) defects and linear-bonded CO on ionic
Pd+, respectively.46 Particularly,
the band at 2170 cm–1 is ascribed to CO adsorbed
on Pd2+ ions, which is much weaker than the one adsorbed
on Pd0, indicating the weak adsorption of CO on Pd2+.47

Figure 7 In situ CO-DRIFTS (a)
and UV–vis DR (b) spectra of Pd/xTA catalysts
before the reaction; and (c) UV–vis
DR spectra of Pd/15TA, Pd/15TA-used (after reaction), and Pd/15TA-CH4 (pretreatment with CH4).

Additional details about the electronic properties of Pd/xTA are revealed by UV–vis DR spectroscopy, as shown
in Figure 7b,c. For
the Pd/0TA catalyst, there is no strong absorption observed in the
available spectral region (λ > 200 nm) (Figure 7b), which agrees well with
the strongly insulating
character of γ-Al2O3.48 As for Pd/xTA (x = 5–25)
catalysts, there are broad absorption bands at 200–400 nm,
which are caused by the charge transfer transition from O2– to Ti4+ (four-coordinated), that is, the excitation of
electrons from the valence band (O 2p characteristics) to the conduction
band (Ti 3d characteristics).49 It worth
noting that the enhanced band intensity may be due to the superimposition
of charge transfer transitions of O2– → Ti4+ and Pd ↔ O. To gain further insights into the relationship
between the structure and properties of catalysts, UV–vis DR
experiment is conducted on Pd/15TA, Pd/15TA-used (after reaction),
and Pd/15TA-CH4 (pretreatment with CH4) (Figure 7c). Compared with
Pd/15TA, a red shift of the band is observed in Pd/15TA-CH4, which results from the change in dielectric constant around the
metal nanoparticles.50 And an enhanced
intensity of the band is also detected; this may be because the pretreatment
with CH4 increases the ability of charge transfer transition
between O2– → Ti4+ and Pd ↔
O. Besides, the intensity of the absorption band of the Pd/15TA-used
catalyst remains relatively strong, which further validates the result
of XPS profiles of fresh and used catalysts and that the ratio of
Pd2+/Pd0 tends to be stable (Figure S7 and Table 1). Therefore, the nature of the interaction between active
palladium and supports is electronic and involves charge transfer
between active palladium and adjacent oxides. The above-mentioned
results explain the improved catalytic activity after methane treatment
and the high activity during cyclic reactions.

2.4 Acid–Base Properties
2.4.1 NH3- and CO2-Temperature-Programmed
Desorption (TPD) Profiles
Figure 8 shows the deconvolution of NH3-TPD and CO2-TPD profiles of Pd/xTA catalysts.
Specifically, all patterns show three NH3 desorption peaks
(Figure 8a), corresponding
to weak (100–200 °C), medium (200–400 °C),
and strong (400–700 °C) acid sites.51 CO2-TPD profiles of the catalysts are presented
in Figure 8b. The peaks
at 30–150, 250–550, and 550–800 °C are also
ascribed to weak, medium, and strong base sites, respectively.18 The amount of acid and base sites is presented
in Table 2. In comparison
with that of the undoped sample, the total amount of acid and base
sites of Ti-containing catalysts decreases significantly, especially
for the Pd/15TA catalyst with the highest catalytic activity; in other
words, a low amount of acid sites is beneficial to the catalytic methane
combustion, which is in line with the result reported by Kinnunen
et al.52 And doping with excessive Ti increases
the amount of acid sites, which is not good for methane oxidation.
As evidenced by the higher desorption temperature of NH3, the strength of medium or strong acid sites of Ti-modified catalysts
is enhanced, which is attributable to the formation of bridged hetero
Ti–O–Al bonds resulting in excessive charges.53 It is also observed that the desorption peaks
of CO2 on the strong base sites shift to a lower temperature
with increasing Ti content, especially for the Pd/15TA catalyst, demonstrating
the weak adsorption capacity for CO2.38

2.4.2 Pyridine-Infrared (Py-IR)
Analysis
To further investigate the influence of acid type
of Pd/xTA catalysts on the catalytic performance,
a Py-IR analysis was performed
(Figure 9). The peaks
at 1614 and 1448 cm–1 are ascribed to pyridine coordinated
with strong Lewis (L)-acid sites and 1576 cm–1 corresponds
to weak L-acid sites.54,55 Besides, the peak at 1491 cm–1 is also related to pyridine coordinated with L-acid
sites, as well as the possible contributions from protonated pyridinium
species on B-acid sites.56 To elucidate
the effect of Ti doping on the amount of L-acid sites, we compared
the peak intensity of L-acid sites (1614 and 1448 cm–1) of the Pd/0TA catalyst with those of Pd/15TA, which show that titanium
doping reduced the amount of L-acid sites. Notably, only Ti-doped
catalysts show weak peaks at 1644 and 1541 cm–1,
which are ascribed to pyridine adsorbed on B-acid sites.56 Combined with the results of NH3-TPD
and XPS, the introduction of Ti leads to excess negative charges,
which are probably balanced by protons adsorbed on the surface, eventually
causing the formation of B-acid sites.57 It is established that the presence of B-acid sites would make the
palladium species electron-deficient, thereby promoting the oxidation
of Pd0 and leading to the enhancement of CH4 combustion activity.27 Moreover, the
adsorption band at 1644 cm–1 of the Pd/15TA catalyst
is stronger than that of the other catalysts, suggesting that an appropriate
doping content of Ti generates more Brønsted-acid sites.

2.5 Discussion
on a Possible Promotion Effect
Methane oxidation over a Pd-based
catalyst is a complex reaction,
which may involve the activation of C–H on active sites in
the vicinity of both Pd and PdO.16,58 Generally,
PdO is the active phase for methane complete combustion, and an appropriate
proportion of Pd2+/Pd0 is beneficial to catalytic
methane combustion (Figure 6). Therefore, the stability of PdO leads to the enhancement
of methane oxidation. As can be seen from O2-TPD profiles
(Figure S8), compared with that of Pd/0TA,
the temperature of PdO decomposition of Pd/15TA shifts to a higher
position, indicating that the doping of Ti increases the interaction
of PdO particles with the support, which strongly confirms the results
of O2-TPO and XRD patterns.

Based on the above analyses,
we propose a possible promotion effect of Ti-containing catalysts
for catalytic methane combustion. XPS spectra of Ti 2p and NH3-TPD profiles of Pd/xTA catalysts affirm
that Ti incorporates into the lattice of alumina and displaces the
Al3+ sites to form Ti–O–Al bonds, which increase
the negative charge around the Al3+ ions. As a result,
the interaction between PdO particles and the support is enhanced,
leading to the improvement of the thermal stability of active PdO,
which has been confirmed by XRD patterns and O2-TPO spectra.
Notably, the excessive negative charge can be balanced by the surface
protons, accompanied by the production of Brønsted-acid sites
(Py-IR spectra), which can induce an electron deficiency in palladium
species, facilitating the oxidation of Pd0 and improving
CH4 combustion activity.

Besides, the CH4-TPD was performed to study the adsorption
behavior of CH4 molecule on the Ti-containing catalyst.
As illustrated in Figure S9, the desorption
peaks of CH4 are observed at 380 and 604 °C for the
catalyst, and the desorption peak attributable to CH3 is
detected at 278 °C. It is indicated that methane is activated
and dehydrogenized to generate CH3 and H during methane
adsorption (CH4 → CH3 + H2 (or H)), and the CH3 group will be adsorbed on the surface
of the catalyst, which is consistent with the proposed mechanism by
Fujimoto et al.59 that the rate-determining
step of CH4 combustion involves the dissociation adsorption
of CH4 on a Pd surface vacancy and Pd–O species
site pair.

In addition, the desorption peaks of H2O are observed
in the illustration at 376 and 592 °C (Figure S9). Based on the mechanism described by Fujimoto,59 we assume that the separated H atom from CH4 would combine with Pd–O bonds to form Pd–OH
species, and H2O is generated by quasi-equilibrated condensation
of Pd–OH species. Therefore, the desorption peaks of H2O can be observed. Remarkably, a CH4 molecule may
be activated by the Brønsted acid sites and then be adsorbed
by oxygen (Oads), or it may react with Pd oxides (CH4 + 4O(PdO) → CO2 + 2H2O) to create
CO2 and H2O.4,60 So, the mass
signal of CO2 is observed. In particular, this process
is effectively promoted due to the higher proportion of Oads in the Pd/15TA catalyst, as evidenced by the XPS spectra of O 1s
(Figure 6b). Moreover,
the presence of a small amount of TiO2 on the catalyst
surface can improve the migration ability of oxygen species, especially
Oads, and subsequently, the vacancy of Oads will
be refilled with the feed gas oxygen.61

3 Conclusions
Through an ultrasonic-assisted
sol–gel method, Ti-doped
alumina was facilely synthesized and taken as supports for palladium
catalysts for methane combustion. Results demonstrate that the incorporation
of Ti adjusts the charge distribution, which induces the generation
of stable PdO particles and the enhancement of PdO–support
interactions. Meanwhile, the migration of reactive oxygen species
can be effectively facilitated due to the existence of oxygen carrier
TiO2, and the tailored performance contributes to the redox
properties and regenerability of PdO particles. In addition, the acid–base
properties over Ti-modified catalysts are modulated as well. Moreover,
the strategy of long-term and isothermal heat treatment under the
reactant stream effectively improves the catalytic activity, and the
catalyst possesses cyclic stability. The above findings highlight
the potential of electronic and acid–base properties in stabilizing
PdO particles, which can be extended to fabricate other high-performance
and sustainable palladium catalysts.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Support Preparation
Ti-doped mesoporous
alumina supports were synthesized by an ultrasonic-assisted sol–gel
method: 10 mmol aluminum isopropoxide was first dispersed in 10 mL
of isopropanol by ultrasound to form solution A. Then, 0.17 mmol P123
(EO20PO70EO20, Mav = 5800) was dissolved
in a mixed solution of absolute ethanol (10 mL) and glacial acetic
acid (0.1 mL) under ultrasonic conditions to form solution B, accompanied
by the addition of a required amount of isopropyl titanate solution
(C12H28O4Ti, 95%). Subsequently,
the two solutions were mixed, and then the ultrasonic reaction was
continued for 1.5 h. The resultant milky white solution was aged at
room temperature for 10 h and then dried in an 80 °C drying oven
overnight. The resulting samples were calcined at 500 °C (1 °C
min–1) and held for 4 h, and then calcined at 900
°C (10 °C min–1) for 1 h. The final samples
were denoted as xTA, and the mass fraction of Ti
(x = 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25) was denoted as x, which was calculated by the equation as follows:  where mTi and mAl2O3 represent the mass
of Ti and alumina, respectively.

4.2 Catalyst
Preparation
Catalysts with
0.5 wt % Pd supported on xTA were prepared by the
incipient wetness impregnation method, and Pd(NO3)2 aqueous solution (0.025 g mL–1) was chosen
as the metal precursor. Typically, the xTA support
was immersed in an aqueous Pd(NO3)2 solution
at room temperature and held overnight. The as-impregnated samples
were dried at 100 °C for 10 h and then calcined at 500 °C
for 1 h in air with a heating rate of 10 °C min–1. The resultant samples were marked Pd/xTA.

4.3 Characterization Techniques
N2 physisorption
measurements were carried out at 77 K on an
ASAP 2460 apparatus. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)
method was utilized to calculate the specific surface areas (SBET). The pore volume and pore size distributions
were derived from the desorption branches of isotherms using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
model. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was measured on a Philips X’Pert
Pro MPD diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406
nm). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, high-angle annular
dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM)
images, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) images were
obtained using a Talos F200X transmission electron microscope with
an accelerating voltage of 200 kV.

Temperature-programmed oxidation
(TPO) and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) experiments were
conducted on a quartz tube microreactor with a thermal conductivity
detector (TCD). O2-TPO: The catalyst powder (100 mg) was
pretreated prior to the measurement under a flow of He (30 mL min–1) for 30 min at 300 °C. Subsequently, the catalyst
was exposed to a mixture of 2 vol % O2 in He (50 mL min–1), and the temperature was then increased to 900 °C
(10 °C min–1) and cooled down. Oxygen release–uptake
was evaluated using a GC-14C gas chromatograph with a TCD detector.
H2-TPR: Before the measurement, the catalyst (100 mg) was
precleaned in N2 (30 mL min–1) holding
at 300 °C for 30 min and was then cooled to room temperature.
The data were collected from room temperature to 800 °C under
10 vol % H2/Ar (30 mL min–1) at a heating
rate of 10 °C min–1. The results were obtained
using a GC-14C gas chromatograph with a TCD.

X-ray photoelectron
spectra (XPS) were obtained on an ESCALAB 250
multifunctional electronic energy spectrometer using Al Kα (E = 1486.6 eV) as the X-ray source. Binding energies were
calculated on the basis of C 1s at 284.8 eV.

In situ diffuse
reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectra
of CO adsorption (CO-DRIFTS) and Fourier transform infrared spectra
of pyridine adsorption (Py-FTIR) over catalysts were recorded using
a Nicolet 6700 spectrometer equipped with an MCT with a resolution
of 2 cm–1. CO-DRIFTS: First, the catalyst was pretreated
with 10 vol % H2/Ar at 300 °C for 30 min, and then
cooled to room temperature under helium gas. Subsequently, CO adsorption
experiment was carried out under 1 vol % CO/He (30 mL min–1) for 1 h. Py-FTIR: Prior to the measurement, the catalyst was pretreated
at 300 °C for 30 min to remove moisture. Pyridine adsorption
was conducted at 30 °C for 30 min and then evacuated at a designated
temperature.

Ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectra
were recorded
on a PerkinElmer Lambda 950 instrument with a diffuse reflectance
spectroscopy technique. All of the spectra were collected and converted
to Kubelka–Munk units, and BaSO4 (AR) was used as
a reflectance standard.

Temperature-programmed desorption of
NH3 (NH3-TPD) and temperature-programmed desorption
of CO2 (CO2-TPD) were conducted on an AutoChem
2910 instrument. In a
typical process of NH3-TPD, 50 mg of the sample was pretreated
at 300 °C for 30 min under a helium stream and then cooled to
30 °C. Then, 8.3 vol % NH3/He stream was introduced
at room temperature and kept for 1 h (30 mL min–1). Desorption was carried out with the temperature increasing up
to 800 °C (10 °C min–1), and the ammonia
desorption was continuously monitored using a TCD. The test process
of CO2-TPD was similar to that of NH3-TPD. The
adsorbed gas was 100 vol % CO2 and the amount of sample
was 200 mg.

Temperature-programmed desorption of CH4 (CH4-TPD) was carried out in a quartz microreactor with
a DYCOR DEM200MS
mass spectrometer detector. Typically, 100 mg of the sample was adsorbed
by 10 vol % CH4/Ar (30 mL min–1) at 400
°C for 30 min and then cooled to 30 °C. Desorption was carried
out with the temperature increasing from 30 °C up to 800 °C
under a helium stream. The composition of the products was detected
by online mass spectrometry with m/z ratios of 44 (CO2), 28 (CO), 18 (H2O), 16
(CH4), and 15 (CH3).

Temperature-programmed
desorption of O2 (O2-TPD) experiments were performed
using the same reaction apparatus
as for O2-TPO. First, the catalyst (100 mg) was pretreated
at 300 °C under He with a flow of 30 mL min–1 for 30 min and then exposed to 2 vol % O2/He (50 mL min–1) at 400 °C for 60 min. Subsequently, the catalyst
was cooled to room temperature. After the catalyst was purged by He
for another 30 min, the catalyst was heated to 950 °C (10 °C
min–1). The O2 signals were detected
by a GC-14C gas chromatograph with a TCD.

4.4 Catalytic
Measurement
Activity measurement
for methane combustion was carried out in a fixed-bed quartz flow
reactor (shown in Figure S10), and the
dosage of catalysts was 0.1 g. The reaction gas containing 1 vol %
CH4 (4 vol % CH4 in N2), 10 vol %
O2 (21 vol % O2 in N2), and N2 equilibrium gas was supplied at a gas hourly space velocity
(GHSV) of 50 000 mL g–1 h–1. For the performance test under wet conditions, 5 vol % water vapor
was added to the feed stream. The products of the reaction were periodically
analyzed online by an Agilent technologies 7820A GC system. The CH4 conversion was denoted as X and calculated
by the equation as follows:  where [CH4]in is the
inlet flow of CH4 and [CH4]out is
the outlet flow of CH4.
