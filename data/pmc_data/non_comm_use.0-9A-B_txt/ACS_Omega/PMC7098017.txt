The monitoring of insulin, which is the only hormone that helps
regulate blood glucose levels in the body, plays a key role in the
diagnosis and treatment of diabetes. However, most techniques today
involve complicated electrode fabrication and testing processes, which
are time-consuming and costly, and require a relatively large volume
of sample. To overcome these drawbacks, we present here a low-cost
insulin detection method based on a screen-printed electrode (SPE)
modified by nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)2). This novel method
only requires 300 μL of insulin sample, and the time it takes
for electrode preparation is about 12 times shorter than traditional
electrode fabrication methods such as coating and sol–gel methods.
The electrochemical behaviors of the Ni(OH)2-coated SPE
(NSPE) sensing area in insulin aqueous solutions are studied using
cyclic voltammetry, amperometric i–t curves, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The
results demonstrate that the NSPE sensing surface has excellent detection
properties, such as a high sensitivity of 15.3 μA·μM–1 and a low detection limit of 138 nM. It takes a short
time (∼10 min) to prepare the NSPE sensing surface, and only
two drops (∼300 μL) of insulin samples are required in
the detection process. Moreover, the selectivity of this method for
insulin detection is verified by detecting mixtures of insulin and
ascorbic acid or bovine hemoglobin. Finally, we discuss the potential
clinical applications of this method by detecting various concentrations
of insulin in human serum.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Insulin, a critical polypeptide hormone produced by the pancreas,
is the only known hormone that can regulate the blood glucose levels
and keep them in a narrow concentration range.1,2 The
hyposecretion or dysfunction of insulin in humans can cause diabetes
mellitus,3 a severe illness that may lead
to chronic damage or dysfunction of various tissues such as eyes,
kidneys, heart, blood vessels, and nerves4 and even death. Compared to glucose, insulin is a stronger predictor
of the condition of the pancreas and plays a more significant role
in diabetes diagnosis and typing.5−7 As a result, fast and
straightforward methods for high-accuracy insulin detection have become
a popular topic among researchers around the world.6,7 Besides
insulin, the detection of other kinds of proteins directly from human
serum samples also plays a key role in illness diagnosis, drug development,
and medical technology.8,9

Typical insulin detection methods include enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay,10 radioimmunoassay,11 and high-performance liquid chromatography.12 However, they are time-consuming, cumbersome,
and costly while requiring extra complex materials and unique instruments.13 By contrast, the direct electrochemical approach
has become a preferred choice because of its advantages such as simplicity,
low cost, high efficiency, and high sensitivity.1

An insulin molecule is composed of two polypeptide chains referred
to as the A and B chains. The A chain consists of 21 amino acids and
the B chain consists of 30 amino acids.13,14Figure 1 shows an insulin structure
with three disulfide bonds and four tyrosine residues. Some functional
groups of an insulin molecule are reported to be electrically active,
and the redox sites are usually deemed hydroxyl and disulfide bonds.15 However, most research studies today have focused
on three disulfide bonds.16 The one formed
in the A chain is exposed to the surface of the insulin’s three-dimensional
structure and proved to be electrically active.15,17 The other two link the A and B chains together.18,19 Of these two disulfide bonds, one is buried deep in the molecule
and can hardly react with the other matter;20 the other one is covered up and reacts very slowly.15 Additionally, the electrochemically active tyrosine residues
are usually buried deep in the three-dimensional structure to form
hydrophobic centers.15,21 This characteristic makes it
difficult for the tyrosine residues to take part in the electrochemical
oxidation process on the electrode surface. Therefore, the uncovered
disulfide bond in the A chain is usually used for the catalytic oxidation
of insulin.22 However, this direct electrooxidation
method has shortcomings such as slow oxidation kinetics and surface
contamination, which can be addressed by surface modification.

Figure 1 NSPE reaction process and the molecular structure of insulin.

Unmodified electrodes offer limited sensitivity and stability when
they are directly used for the electrochemical detection of insulin.
Their surface may be easily polluted by the high potential produced
during insulin oxidation.18 A variety of
functionalized electrodes have been employed to facilitate insulin
oxidation and detection. Examples include screen-printed electrodes
(SPEs) modified by carbon nanotube–nickel–cobalt oxide,14 carbon electrodes modified by nickel nanoparticles,23,24 carbon paste electrodes modified by silicon carbide nanoparticles25 and silica gel,26 glassy carbon electrodes modified by nickel oxide nanoparticle-multiwalled
carbon nanotubes (MWCNs),27 and nickel
nanoparticle-modified electrodes.13 In
particular, Lin et al.28 demonstrated a
method that uses a graphene nanometer light sensor for real-time detection
of insulin. The concentration of insulin is reflected by the conductivity
changes during the combination of electrodes and insulin.

In addition, electrokinetics has emerged as a promising method
to enhance the sensitivity and applicability of modified electrode-based
detection methods for electrochemical applications. It has been demonstrated
that electrokinetics enables in situ improvement of the performance
of electrochemical biosensors in pathogen and cytokine detection.29,30 Wong et al. enhanced the detection results of Escherichia
coli by using an AC electrothermal flow technique.29 Furthermore, this kind of electrodynamic enhancement
also brings improved detection limits for electrochemical sensors.

Metal oxides and semiconductor nanomaterials (e.g., Ag, Au, and
Ni(OH)2) have been widely applied in fabricating functionalized
electrodes. Various forms of Ni and Ni(OH)2 materials have
been used in sensors because they are nontoxic, low cost, and easy
to prepare and store.31 Nickel, as a modifier,
has a variety of oxidation states and is therefore a suitable candidate
for fast electron transfer. Ni(OH)2/NiOOH exhibits good
electrocatalytic effects on insulin. Because of their respective advantages,
these materials have drawn considerable attention from the research
community. Lin et al. proposed a Ni(OH)2–GN/GC electrode
synthesized via a one-pot method.31 Martínez-Periñán
et al. presented a Ni(OH)2 NPs/Nafion-MWCNIS/GC electrode
by means of electrodeposition.1 Jia et
al. reported a stable ultrathin film of Ni(OH)2 nanoparticles
at the gas/liquid interface.32

In this work, we functionalized a SPE with Ni(OH)2 through
a simple and fast electrodeposition process in which only a milliliter
scale of electrodeposition solutions (3 mL) was used. We chose the
SPE because of its small size and low cost. The fabricated Ni(OH)2-coated SPE (NSPE) exhibits satisfactory electrocatalytic
activity, stability, high sensitivity, and low detection limits, as
well as quick response times for insulin detection.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of the NSPE
The
morphology and element composition of the NSPE were investigated utilizing
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX).
In the experiment, a layer of platinum film was sprayed on the surface
of the SPE to ensure better conductivity. The SEM images of the SPE
before and after deposition and the EDX images of the decorated SPE
are shown in Figure 2. At 2.00k times magnification (Figure 2A), the surface of the bare electrode is
flat, while after deposition, the surface of the modified electrode
has different flakes of particles and large bulges (Figure 2C). At 100k times magnification
(Figure 2B,D), differences
can also be observed in surface morphologies of the bare electrode
and the modified electrode, which indicates that the target material
was attached to the bare electrode. Furthermore, the elements present
on the coated SPE surface were analyzed using EDX. As shown in Figure 2E, Ni and O elements
are present on the surface of the carbon electrode. Because the current
energy spectrometer cannot detect elements before the fifth element,
the H element is not shown in the EDX result. Therefore, the above
results demonstrated that the SPE was successfully modified by nickel
hydroxide.

modification. (E) EDX image of the modified electrode.

2.2 Electrochemical Characterization of the NSPE
via Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy
Electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a powerful and informative technique.27 It can provide characteristics of the electrode
surface to help determine whether a functionalization process is successful.33Figure 3A shows the Nyquist plots of the bare (black dots) and functionalized
electrodes (red dots), with the same voltage as applied in the open-circuit
condition and a frequency range of 1 × 10–2 to 1 × 106 Hz. It is composed of two typical parts:
the semicircular part that corresponds to the electron-transfer restriction
process and the linear part that represents the diffusion restriction
process.31 The semicircle’s diameter
represents the electron-transfer resistance on the electrode surface.
The nickel hydroxide-modified electrode has a 10.87% smaller electron-transfer
resistance on its surface than the bare electrode.

Figure 3 (A) Nyquist plot of the NSPE (red dots) and SPE (black dots); (B)
CV of the SPE in the absence (a) and presence of 1 mM insulin in 0.1
M NaOH (b) and NSPE in the absence (c) and presence of 1 mM insulin
in 0.1 M NaOH (d). Scan rate: 100 mV/s; (C) amperometric curves obtained
for the NSPE in the 1, 5, 10, and 25 μM insulin in 0.10 M NaOH
solution; (D) CV measured using the NSPE in 0.10 M NaOH + 1 mM insulin
at the scan rates of 50, 70, 100, 150, and 200 mV s–1; (E) plot of peak currents and scan rates; and (F) amperometric
curve responses of the NSPE in 1 and 20 μmol/L of insulin for
five times.

As shown in Figure 3A, the low-frequency part of the NSPE (R2 = 0.994) is much closer to a straight line than that of the SPE
(R2 = 0.813). It demonstrates that modifying
the electrode surface with nickel hydroxide can dramatically improve
the conductivity and electron-transfer process. In other words, the
functionalization process was successful, as evidenced by the changes
in the electrode surface’s characteristics.

2.3 Electrocatalytic Activity of the SPE
The electrocatalytic activity of the NSPE was investigated using
cyclic voltammetry (CV) in a potential window of 0.0–1.0 V.
The NSPE and SPE were placed in 0.1 M NaOH solution with and without
insulin, respectively. In Figure 3B, curves a and b show the CV of the SPE in the absence
and presence of 1 mM insulin in 0.1 M NaOH solution, respectively.
No peak is observed, indicating that almost no electrochemical reaction
took place on the bare electrode surface. Curves c and d, in which
oxidation peaks are observed, represent the CV of the NSPE in the
absence and presence of 1 mM insulin in 0.1 M NaOH solution.

As shown in Figure 3B, the oxidation peak of curve d is larger than that of curve c.
This means that when insulin is present, the oxidation current of
the NSPE is larger than when it is absent, indicating that insulin
was involved in the redox process. A voltage range from 0 to 1 V and
a constant scan rate of 100 mV·s–1 were used
throughout the experiment. As indicated in curve c, the oxidation
current peak occurred in the oxidation of Ni(II) to Ni(III) (as shown
in eq 1). A reduction
peak attributed to the conversion from β-NiOOH to β-Ni(OH)227 (as shown in eq 2) can also be observed in the direction
of negative potential scan. 1   2  

Curve d clearly shows an increase in the oxidation current, which
was attributed to the oxidation of Ni(II) to Ni(III) as well as the
reaction between Ni(III) and insulin. This indicates that the modified
Ni(OH)2 participated and significantly enhanced the electrocatalytic
oxidation of insulin.34 The oxidation current
peak depends on the concentration of the added insulin solution. Ni(OH)2 helps in the conversion of Ni(III) to Ni(II), which will
once again be oxidized to Ni(III).27 The
catalytic effect of the Ni(II)/Ni(III) redox coupling on insulin oxidation
is described as follows. 3   4  

These results indicate that the NSPE has excellent electrocatalytic
activity for insulin oxidation and can be further applied for accurate
insulin determination.

2.4 Effects of Scan Rate and Insulin Concentration
How the scan rate affects the oxidation current was studied using
CV, where the NSPE was immersed in 0.1 M NaOH solution in the presence
of 0.1 mM insulin. As shown in Figure 3D,E, the oxidation current increases with the scan
rate. This indicates that the electrode surface was undergoing redox
reaction with insulin, which is believed to be a surface-controlled
electrochemical process where electron transfer takes place.13 The potential of the oxidation peak gradually
increases as the scan rate increases from 50 to 200 mV s–1 with uneven steps. This implies that the redox reaction between
the modified electrode and insulin is a typical surface-controlled
electrochemical process.

According to the conclusion drawn by
Yu et al.,13i–t curve is another sensitive measurement technique for detecting
low concentrations of insulin. Figure 3C shows how varying concentrations of insulin affect
the oxidation current through amperometric i–t curves. The i–t curve moves up with the increase in insulin concentration. Surface
control plays an important role in the whole oxidation process, which
is catalyzed by the modified electrode as the insulin concentration
increases. In our work, the NSPE and the analysis of amperometric i–t curves were further applied
for insulin detection.

2.5 Electrochemical Determination of Insulin Based
on the NSPE and Amperometry
Insulin detection was performed
based on the amperometric i–t curve. In this experiment, a voltage of 680 mV was applied, and
for every 10 s, 5 μL of 1 μM insulin was injected near
the NSPE immersed in 0.1 M NaOH solution. The insulin concentration
was raised gradually by the step of 1 μM. Figure 4A shows the current response of insulin oxidized
on the surface of the NSPE.

Figure 4 (A) Amperometric i–t curve
responses of the NSPE to insulin in 0.1 M NaOH; (B) linear relationship
between insulin concentration and current; (C) current of the NSPE
to insulin, AA, and BHB in 0.1 M NaOH; (D) responses of the NSPE with
different concentrations of insulin in human serum.

As illustrated in Figure 4B, there is a linear relationship (correlation coefficient:
0.9939) between the mean current (every 10 s) after each insulin injection
and insulin concentration. Table 1 provides a comparison between our NSPE and electrodes
reported in other works. Our electrode presents several advantages
such as high sensitivity (15.3 μA·μM–1), low detection limit (138 nM), and good stability, making it highly
suitable for insulin determination. Its higher electron conductivity
than the others also helps ensure good performance during insulin
detection.

2.6 Repeatability of the NSPE
Figure 3F shows the responses
of the NSPE in 1 and 20 μmol/L of insulin for five groups of
tests, respectively. The results showed relative standard deviations
of 7.05% (1 μmol/L) and 2.23% (20 μmol/L), indicating
that the detection of insulin concentration with this electrode had
good repeatability.

2.7 Molecular Recognition of the NSPE
Selectivity and anti-interference are important factors impacting
the performance of an insulin detection method. Some common compounds
in the blood often interfere with insulin detection.35,37,38 However, the method based on
the Ni(OH)2/NiOOH redox has good selectivity on insulin,
which has been demonstrated by related works already. For example,
Yu et al. detected insulin using a NiNP/ITO electrode based on the
principle of the Ni(OH)2/NiOOH redox.13 They studied the interference of ascorbic acid (AA), UA,
and glucose during insulin detection. The results demonstrated that
the influence of a small amount of UA, AA, or glucose on insulin was
negligible. Based on the same principle, Zhang et al. detected insulin
using an EDA-CNF-NiO/GCE electrode.39 They
examined the roles of γ-globulins, myoglobin (Myb), and pepsin
as interferents in biological liquids and found that these compounds
had less influence on insulin detection. A more detailed comparison
is shown in Table 2. In order to study the selectivity on insulin detection, the NSPE
was also tested with two interferents: 0.1 mmol/L AA and 1 μmol/L
bovine hemoglobin (BHB). Figure 4C shows that the NSPE works well on detecting human
insulin (10 pmol/L), regardless of the presence of AA and BHB, which
demonstrates that the NSPE is a highly selective method for detecting
insulin.

h indicates that the electrode has
selectivity among these interferents. D represents
the diameter and L represents the length. All these
methods were built based on the same insulin detection principle:
the (Ni(OH)2/NiOOH) redox.

To examine the detection capability of the NSPE in a more realistic
working environment, the NSPE was used to detect the content of insulin
in human whole serum (purchased from Shanghai Qiaoxing Biology). In
a normal human body, the fasting plasma insulin content is 35–143.5
pmol/L.40 The half-life of insulin is less
than 9.0 min.41−43 This means that the insulin originally contained
in that serum can be ignored. Therefore, different concentrations
of human insulin were added to the serum to simulate the blood of
diabetics with different secretion levels of insulin. The current
was studied by amperometric i–t curves. Figure 4D
shows the relationship between the concentration of insulin and the
detecting current based on the NSPE. Because the serum environment
is different from the calibration environment, that is, 0.1 M NaOH
solution, used in the experiment in Section 2.5, the sensitivity and detection limit of
the NSPE in detecting whole serum vary slightly from those obtained
from our experiment. Finally, we demonstrated that the NSPE is capable
of detecting the concentration of insulin in human body and thereby
aiding doctors in the diagnosis of diabetes.

3 Conclusions
In this paper, we present a novel method that uses a SPE modified
by nickel hydroxide for insulin detection. The method allows the fabrication
of an insulin detection sensor with a high sensitivity of 15.3 μA·μM–1 and a low detection limit of 138 nM. Both the EIS
and CV curves demonstrate that Ni(OH)2 can be modified
on the SPE surface to produce excellent conductivity and catalytic
activity for insulin. Experiments with varying CV scan rates and insulin
concentrations prove that the NSPE is highly sensitive to insulin.
The results from insulin detection based on i–t curves reveal a linear relationship between the response
current and insulin concentration, with a correlation coefficient
of 0.9939. Furthermore, the selectivity for insulin of this method
has been verified by testing the interferents of AA and BHB. In addition,
the method’s capability of detecting insulin in human serum
has been validated experimentally. To sum up, our work provides a
fast, inexpensive, and simple solution to the detection of microliter
scale insulin. The proposed NSPE proves to have good catalytic activity
and may be used in other electrochemical detection applications in
the future.

However, there are still some issues that remain to be addressed.
Although the NSPE is easy to fabricate and ready for mass production,
further studies are required to miniaturize it for commercialized
fingertip blood detection while maintaining high levels of accuracy.
Also, other types of insulin such as porcine insulin need to be factored
in for comparison. Furthermore, in order to make the Ni(OH)2 electrode more stable, it is essential to add some organics to modify
its properties.

4 Materials and Method
4.1 Chemicals and Materials
The bovine
insulin (5733.49, ≥27 UPS units mg–1) was
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA) (the action of bovine is very similar
to that of human insulin; the detection method for bovine insulin
is also applicable to human insulin.44).
An insulin stock solution (2 mM) was prepared daily by dissolving
powdery insulin in water with 10.0 μL of HCl (1 M). Then, the
stock solution was progressively diluted.

The pristine SPE was
acquired from Xenslet Studio (China). The deposition solution was
prepared by dissolving 0.992 g of Ni(NO3)2 powder
in 100 mL of ultrapure water, and its concentration was 0.08 mol/L.
0.1 M NaOH was used as the electrolyte in the experiments given that
it allows insulin to have good electrochemical response,45 and it closely matches the alkaline environment
in human blood. AA and BHB were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA).
The human insulin (5807.69) was purchased from China Institute of
Pharmaceutical and Biological Products (Beijing, China). All the electrochemical
experiments were performed at room temperature. All solutions were
prepared with ultrapure water. All other chemicals were of analytical
grade and used without further purification.

4.2 Instruments
The structure and morphology
of the SPE were observed by a scanning electron microscope (Hitachi,
S4800, Japan). The electrochemical experiments were carried out in
the CHI660e electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chenhua Co., China).
A conventional three-electrode setup was used with a bare or modified
carbon electrode as the working electrode, Ag as the reference electrode,
and a carbon electrode as the counter electrode. Both the EIS and
CV experiments were carried out in 0.5 mL centrifuge tubes.

4.3 Preparation of the SPE
The SPE was
immersed in the deposition solution for 600 s for the electrodeposition
of Ni(NO3)2 under a voltage of 0.7 mV as provided
by the electrochemical workstation. Then, the voltage was removed,
and the treated SPE was left in the deposition solution for 30 s or
longer to stabilize the modified layer. The SPE was then taken out
and air-dried at room temperature. After these operations, the SPE
surface was successfully coated by Ni(OH)2 and ready for
catalyzing the redox reaction of insulin. For convenience, we refer
to the SPE coated with Ni(OH)2 as the NSPE in this paper.

To identify the best potential for a complete Ni(II) to Ni(III)
conversion, the NSPE was placed in 0.1 M NaOH solution for CV at different
potentials, and a scan rate of 100 mV·s–1 was
used. The portion of the SPE serving as the sensing element was originally
in black (as shown in Figure 5A). When the SPE was submerged in the electrodeposition solution,
bubbles would appear near the sensing area (as illustrated in Figure 5B). After the electrodeposition
process, the surface of the sensing area would turn green, that is,
coated with green Ni(II). During the detection of insulin by the NSPE,
the green Ni(II) was oxidized to black Ni(III), and then the black
Ni(III) would be reduced back to green Ni(II) (i.e., “grayish
green”, as not all Ni(III) were reduced back to Ni(II). The
entire process is shown in Figure 5.

a comparison between our electrode and several other modified ones
from the perspectives of electrode material, functionalization method,
time consumed, electrode size, interference, etc.
