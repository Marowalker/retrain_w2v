Water
diffusion into polymers like thermosetting epoxies is well-studied;
however, comparably little has been reported thus far on the related
but very different mechanism of acid diffusion and the corresponding
influence on material degradation. The diffusion of hydrochloric acid
into an amine-cured epoxy system was studied in this work using gravimetric
analysis and dielectric monitoring concurrently, and the mass uptake
behavior was observed to differ significantly compared with water
diffusion, faster by an order of magnitude. A unique 3-stage diffusion
of acid into epoxy was observed due to the influence of Coulombic
interactions between oppositely charged ionic species diffusing at
different rates. Material characterization studies have revealed that
the dominant degradation mechanism is physical in nature, with the
formation of surface cracks driven by the swelling stresses due to
the core–shell swelling behavior in highly concentrated hydrochloric
acid, leading to an erosion-type degradation phenomenon. The insights
gained from understanding acid electrolyte diffusion could serve to
design a more effective and efficient process to enable thermoset
recycling by facilitating rapid material breakdown or the design of
acid-resistant materials for various applications in chemical storage
tanks, batteries, and protective coatings in a corrosive environment.

Introduction
Resource depletion
and societies’ difficulty in addressing
the end-of-life management of cross-linked polymer products have led
to trending research interests in related topics such as recyclable
thermosets1−4 and fiber recovery from composite wastes.5 While most reported works focused on elucidating the enabling chemical
reactions that permit controllable degradation, typically with acids
and/or heat, the physical chemistry aspects of the diffusion-limited
degradation process are poorly understood. Furthermore, since such
materials are often used in their glassy state, the diffusion behavior
of acids into glassy thermosets is expected to be similar, regardless
of whether the polymer is designed to be degradable or not. Thermosetting
epoxies are often the material of choice for applications handling
corrosive media, but even then, the diffusion mechanism and the corresponding
material degradation behavior are not well understood. Epoxy resins
are considered among the top-line materials in terms of chemical corrosion
resistance; however, most relevant investigations into the origin
of chemical resistance tend to be restricted to qualitative evaluations
such as those data published in material handbooks or chemical compatibility
guides, which only provide a superficial insight into the environmental
conditions and resistance duration.6,7 In contrast
to the common assumption that acid degradation is a chemical degradation
process, it was realized through this work that the actual mechanism
is a physical degradation process driven by the aggressive plasticization
of the amine-cured epoxy thermoset matrix as the diffusing ionic species
binds with the polar moieties and disrupts the noncovalent bonding
within the polymer network. The ensuing nonequilibrium swelling behavior
led to physical erosion, which was observed to be the main degradation
mechanism. Understanding how the diffusion of acidic electrolyte into
thermoset matrix leads to a corresponding degradation in material
properties8,9 or erosion would facilitate the educated
selection of suitable materials and assist in the molecular design
of tailormade resin precursors for either applications requiring improved
chemical resistance or even controlled chemical degradation of the
thermoset resin matrix to enable composite fiber recovery5,10 and polymer recycling.1,2

Recent interest
in the diffusion of acids in polymers is related
to understanding the mechanism behind the resolution limitation of
chemical amplified photoresists to enable the design of more precise
materials for nanoelectronics.11,12 Even though many contemporary
works were reported on the topic of acid-degradable thermoset for
sustainable polymer chemistry, these research studies focused on the
acid-degradable polymer chemistry and largely ignored the acid diffusion
mechanic studies.1−4 Thus, in this work, the objective was to understand comprehensively
the accelerated diffusion mechanism of acid electrolytes into glassy
thermosets and propose explanations for the various phenomena observed
leading to eventual material degradation.

Neogi compiled an
excellent overview of various phenomena and models
related to diffusion into polymers, and while most of the diffusion
systems reviewed were thermoplastics, the concepts are expected to
hold true for thermoset systems.13 Hojo
et al. presented the classical phenomena of the erosion-corrosion
process by which a thermoset undergoes chemical degradation when immersed
in corrosive media.14 A similar mechanism
in biodegradable polymers was reported by Göpferich et al.,
who presented a theoretical model based on the ratio between the penetrant
diffusion rate and the polymer degradation rate.15,16 While these studies focused on the consequential degradation behavior,
they provide little insight into the basis behind the rapid diffusion
of acidic electrolyte into the thermoset matrix compared with benign
media like water.

On the contrary, water diffusion into epoxy
thermosets has been
studied extensively and the network effects well understood;9,17−20 however, controversy remains due to the many proposed diffusion
theories that have yet to be definitively disproved or established
as the dominant mechanism.21−26 In spite of the debates, recent pieces of evidence point toward
the domineering effect of network polarity over other factors such
as free volume or cross-link density to influence equilibrium water
sorption and the uptake rate.9,23,26−30 Most of the epoxy-water diffusion systems investigated were able
to reach equilibrium sorption, indicating the lack of chemical degradation
or erosion observed within the timespan of the studies; however, Toscano
et al. utilized a photoelastic stress analysis technique to reveal
the evolution of swelling stresses over the period of water sorption.31 Thus, for systems with a larger mass uptake,
it would be expected to undergo erosion by swelling-induced fractures
along the swelling stress boundaries. Dielectric studies were used
to correlate the relationship between dielectric permittivity and
absorbed moisture, as well to identify the bounded state of water
within the epoxy matrix,32−34 which might be useful to monitor
the diffusion of more polar electrolytes into the epoxy matrix. Miszczyk
et al. further developed methods to correlate impedance data from
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy to obtain the corresponding
capacitance values that were found to vary with gravimetric data of
amine-cured epoxy coatings immersed in water.35

The aim of this paper was to describe in detail the sorption
behavior
of hydrochloric acid (HCl) into an amine-cured epoxy by concurrent
gravimetric measurements and dielectric monitoring. The swelling mechanisms
leading to eventual physical erosion were investigated by modulated
dynamic scanning calorimetry (mDSC) and Fourier transform infrared-attenuated
total reflection (FTIR-ATR). The epoxy-amine system was studied in
various stoichiometric ratios to briefly address the effect of network
polarity and cross-link density in relation to HCl sorption.

Theoretical
Background
Gravimetric Measurements
The one-dimension Fick’s
diffusion equation can be solved by applying initial and boundary
conditions36 for values of Mt/M∞ lower than 0.5 to give the following 1  where Mt is the total amount of penetrant that
entered the substrate
at time t relative to the initial dry specimen mass, M∞ is the equilibrium penetrant content
after a very long time, l is the substrate thickness,
and D is the diffusion coefficient.

D can be calculated from the slope of the Mt versus t1/2 curve by rearrangement of eq 1 into the following 2  It
must be noted that similar works in the
literature may or may not have taken into consideration the effect
of the substrate thickness variation due to swelling.17−21,27−29 While this
effect may be considered miniscule and thus negligible in epoxy/water
swelling systems, the thickness variation was observed to be quite
significant for epoxy/HCl acid swelling systems, which experience
upward of 50% mass increase and over 20% thickness increase before
fracture. Due to the non-Fickian nature of the epoxy/acid diffusion
system and the above-mentioned issue of sample fractures due to nonequilibrium
swelling, eq 2 may not
be the most suitable equation to model the entire diffusion process.
However, after considering the complexity of the acid swelling process,
the lack of alternative models, and the insights it delivers compared
with the well-studied epoxy/water systems, it was decided that this
model is still relevant in spite of its limitations to represent the
intrinsic differences of epoxy/acid diffusion systems. As D cannot be directly obtained using eq 2 as the equilibrium mass is unmeasurable due
to fractures, the initial linear slope portion of the Mt versus t1/2 curve, Si, is proposed
to be a representative diffusion function proportional to D. 3  The idealized Fickian diffusion
behavior can
typically be observed only in lightly cross-linked elastomers above
its Tg, as the mechanism of solvent uptake
is understood to be dominated by the occupation of free volume sites
with minimal interactions between the solvent and the polymer. For
most polymer systems that undergo swelling, the diffusional behavior
cannot be adequately described by the idealized Fickian theory;37 thus, eq 1 can be simplified into 4  where Mt is the mass uptake, k is a constant, t is the immersion time, and n = 1/2 for
Fickian behavior. Non-Fickian anomalous diffusion is characterized
by 1/2 < n < 1.

Results and Discussion
Difference
between Water and HCl Diffusion by Gravimetric Measurement
Amine-cured epoxies with different cross-link densities and network
polarities were immersed in water and 10 M HCl in an attempt to identify
the difference in the diffusion mechanism and to characterize the
subsequent thermoset network response.

Diffusion of water into
epoxy thermosets has been studied extensively, but there remains uncertainty
regarding the effect of free volume or other network interactions
such as adsorption and polarity effects; thus, to address this issue,
multifunctional amine and epoxy monomers were cured in various amine
hydrogen/epoxide ratios (r = 0.5–1.5) to form
samples ranging from amine-deficient to amine-rich, thus bringing
about a diversity of network polarities and cross-link densities to
evaluate the diffusion behavior (Table 1). Interesting to note, while it was predicted that
the dielectric constant is indicative of the network polarity and
thus proportional to the amine content of the amine-cured epoxy samples,
this relationship was not observed in the obtained dielectric constant
results. The cross-link density result did not exactly comply proportionally
with the projected cross-link density from stoichiometric predictions.
The deviations from prediction were proposed to be due to the formation
of specific, thermodynamically preferable oligomeric conformations
during the initial cure process, which result in the excess end group
moieties being frozen in place during subsequent vitrification, thus
leading to the observed deviation in network polarity and cross-link
density from stoichiometric predictions. Nonetheless, the variation
in material characteristics of the various amine hydrogen/epoxide
ratios (r = 0.5–1.5) suffices for this study
to investigate the effects on diffusion behavior in both water and
concentrated HCl. The results of water diffusion were then compared
to the diffusion study of amine-cured epoxy in 10 M HCl to identify
the different mass uptake characteristics and phenomena.

The mass uptake behavior of epoxies in water (Figure 1A) was observed to
be in agreement
with that of other studies,23,27 in that water diffuses
more readily into networks with a higher amine content (larger r value) and reaches a higher equilibrium mass. The influence
of free volume, which was theoretically dependent on density and cross-link
density, did not appear to influence the mass uptake or equilibrium
mass at all with regard to water diffusion. The mass uptake rate in
10 M HCl (Figure 1B),
as represented by the obtained Si value,
was observed to be over an order of magnitude higher compared with
that of water. No equilibrium mass was observed in 10 M HCl due to
eventual physical erosion and disintegration before equilibrium could
be reached. Again, networks with higher amine content were observed
to absorb HCl faster and physically disintegrate within a short immersion
time. Sample R0.9 with a higher cross-link density
was observed to maintain physical integrity and achieve the highest
mass uptake before disintegration than the rest. These results indicate
that while the diffusion rate is dependent on network polarity, the
cross-link density also plays an important role in maintaining physical
integrity, especially for systems that experience significant swelling.
The results were observed to be in agreement with the study by Li
et al.,23 in that the binding with polar
amine sites within the thermoset network is an essential factor determining
the equilibrium mass for both water and HCl, but the achievable equilibrium
mass was also found to be limited by mechanical constraints before
physical degradation occurs.

(A) water and in (B)
10 M HCl; the diffusion rate of HCl into epoxy was observed to be
an order of magnitude faster compared with that of water. Diffusion
behavior of amine-cured epoxies in (C) water, which is Fickian-like,
and in (D) 10 M HCl, where a 3-stage diffusion mechanism of HCl into
epoxy was observed. (E) The formation of Eint restricts the flux of the faster diffusing cationic species, leading
to the 3-stage diffusion mechanism.

The diffusion behavior was evaluated according to eq 4. Water diffusion (Figure 1C) was observed to
adhere closely
to the Fickian diffusion behavior with n ≈
0.5 at various r values, indicating that while the
network polarity and cross-link density were expected to influence
the diffusion coefficient, they did not affect the diffusion behavior
as the thermoset remains glassy until equilibrium mass was reached.
Conversely, the diffusion behavior of HCl was observed to follow a
3-stage mechanism, followed by eventual physical disintegration before
equilibrium mass was achieved (Figure 1D).

On first impression, it was proposed that
the 3-stage HCl diffusion
mechanism was due to erosion of the samples under excessive swelling.
However, the erosion of samples was only observed after some periods
of swelling, and different samples begin eroding at different times;
thus, while the erosion phenomenon was observed, it was not likely
to cause the 3-stage HCl diffusion mechanism. Furthermore, in spite
of the different network polarity and cross-link density of the amine-cured
epoxy samples, the three stages were observed to occur within the
same time phase, indicating that the mechanism should be due to the
specific diffusion behavior of the HCl acid electrolyte instead of
the thermoset matrix characteristics.

It was proposed by Zaikov
et al. that the diffusion of the electrolytes
into polymers should take into consideration the diffusivity of individual
ionic components of the electrolyte media instead of simply assuming
the diffusion of the electrolyte as a homogeneous penetrant.9,38 Consequently, the different diffusivities of cationic and anionic
penetrants into the polymer bulk would lead to the formation of an
interior electric field (Eint) between
the cationic and anionic propagation fronts. The Eint would restrict the diffusivity of the ionic species,
subsequently resulting in reduced diffusivity of the ionic species,
as observed in stage II of HCl diffusion. Eventually, an equilibrium
would be reached between the diffusion of ionic species driven by
the concentration gradient and the restrictive Eint, resuming diffusive propagation as a unified layer at stage
III of HCl diffusion (Figure 1E). Thus, the 3-stage mechanism of HCl acid electrolyte behavior
appears to be in agreement with the theoretical proposition made by
Zaikov et al. over 30 years ago.

The obtained cross-link density
in Table 1 infers the
covalent network density as the Mc is
obtained from the rubbery modulus at Tg+40°C. Thus, the cross-link density would
not have much of an effect on Eint, which
is dependent on the electrostatic interactions between the bounded
ionic species. As observed from the mass uptake curves of R0.5–1.5 (Figure 1B), the diffusivity was found to be determined by the
concentration of polar amine species (secondary and tertiary amine),
instead of the expected covalent cross-link density. The ability of
the amine moieties to attract ionic acid penetrants overshadows the
restriction of network relaxation as imposed by the cross-link density.

To summarize, cross-link density does not appear to have any effect
on Eint or diffusion of ionic penetrants.

Effect of HCl Concentration on Swelling Behavior
As R0.9 was observed to tolerate the largest swelling in HCl,
it was used to study the effect of HCl concentration on mechanisms
of physical degradation during acid swelling. Interesting point to
note, HCl acid with concentration above 25 wt % (∼8 M) is classified
as corrosive liquid, whereas it is only considered an irritant at
concentrations below 25 wt %. Thus, while no formal research has been
performed to determine the diffusion mechanism of HCl acids into polymers,
industrial experience and qualitative studies indicated the influence
of HCl concentration on acid diffusion into the polymer matrix. As
expected, increasing HCl concentration corresponds to an increase
in the mass uptake rate (Figure 2). During the course of study, it was observed that
at high HCl concentration above 8 M, R0.9 experienced
core–shell swelling, leading to rapid disintegration due to
swelling stresses and eventual erosion of the surface. The concurrent
erosion mechanism while swelling complicates the mass uptake measurements,
as only the net weight gain could be recorded. Thus, although the
reported net mass uptake values for 8 and 10 M appear to be lower
than 5 M, it is in truth much higher due to the erosion loss. The
higher acid concentration would lead to a higher concentration gradient
between the surface and the interior bulk, thus leading to higher
diffusivity. The surface erosion phenomenon, while being attributed
to the swelling-induced physical degradation that is dependent on
diffusivity, is also dependent on the available surface area. The
mass uptake values for 10 M HCl concentration appeared to be double
that of 8 M, as the epoxy specimen swells much more with a thicker
swollen shell than 8 M, but the erosion rate was only slightly higher
due to a limited surface area available for erosion. It must be noted
that even with crazes and cracks, the fractured but-yet-to-be eroded
surface still experiences significant swelling that contributes to
the observed mass uptake. Whereas at lower HCl concentration (<8
M), although the diffusion of HCl into amine-cured epoxy appeared
to be relatively stable with little erosion loss, the significant
swelling of the exterior layers led to formation of stress gradients,
which cause warpage and eventual fracture of the sample disks after
prolonged swelling (refer to Supporting Information S4).

Figure 2 Mass uptake of R0.9 at HCl concentration from
0.1 to 10 M, and the physical degradation mechanism observed. The
mass uptake rate of R0.9 in 8 M and 10 M HCl appeared
to be lower than that of 5 M due to surface erosion loss during measurement.
In general, mass uptake increases correspondingly with HCl concentration.
The inset shows the cross-section micrograph of R0.9 in 10 M HCl after 24 h when core–shell swelling is evident.

Core–shell swelling has
previously been reported in various
polymer systems14−16,37 and was described in
detail by C.E. Rogers as Case II diffusion in which the diffusion
was observed to be so rapid that a distinct boundary was observed
between the swollen exterior and the glassy inner core. In the case
of R0.9 immersed in HCl larger than 8 M, the rapidly
swollen exterior was observed to be only a thin surface layer, which
cracked and eroded away from the unswollen bulk. Even when core–shell
swelling behavior was not observed, the evolution of strained layers
in the exterior due to swelling-induced stress transfer to the unswollen
core was reported to influence the penetrant diffusion rate.39 Thus, when also taking into consideration the
electric field restricted electrolyte diffusion and the thermophysical
changes of the polymer matrix due to plasticization effects, it would
present a highly complicated challenge to model the acid diffusion
process in light of so many variables and concurrent processes.

Dielectric Changes during HCl Uptake
To validate the
theory of electric field restricted diffusion and investigate the
noncovalent polar binding interactions between the diffusing HCl species
and the amine-cured epoxy matrix, dielectric measurements were performed
concurrently with weight monitoring when R0.9 was
immersed in deionized water and 10 M HCl at 60 °C. The dielectric
constant measured at 1 kHz is indicative of the ionic polarization
response when the penetrant diffuses into the amine-cured epoxy network.

The obtained result for dielectric response of diffused water into R0.9 (Figure 3A) was observed to be consistent with that by Garden et al. on dielectric
changes due to water diffusion in another epoxy system, in that the
increase in dielectric constant does not correspond proportionally
to the increase in water uptake mass, which was explained by a network
confinement effect restricting the dipolar response.32 In contrast, the measured dielectric constant was found
to increase accordingly with HCl mass uptake over time (Figure 3B), and a sharp increase in
the dielectric constant by a few orders of magnitude was observed
after the onset of HCl diffusion stage II. Initially, it was proposed
that the onset of stage II during electrolyte diffusion was due to
the restriction of ionic mobility to maintain charge neutrality;9,38 however, the exceptionally large increase in dielectric constant
up to almost 5000 cannot be explained without also taking into consideration
the effects of polar interactions with the matrix. For comparison,
the dielectric constant of R0.9 was measured to be
about 3.5 initially, 10 M HCl was measured to be around 5, and water
was around 80. Thus, the large dielectric constant could only be explained
by the ionic polarization between HCl and the tertiary amine moieties
within the amine-cured epoxy network, which stabilizes the charge
separation between the electrolyte ionic species and thus contributes
to the large increase in the measured dielectric constant. The exceptionally
large dielectric constant was only observed at relatively low frequencies,
which corresponds to ionic polarization, and the effect disappears
at higher frequencies, further confirming the phenomenon to be due
to the charge separation effects caused by the polar interactions
between HCl ionic species and the amine-cured epoxy network (Figure 3D). Water does not
disassociate in the epoxy network (Figure 3C); thus, while the slight increase in dielectric
constant could be attributed to the interaction with polar moieties
such as hydroxy and amine functionalities,32 no significant increase in dielectric constant similar to HCl swelling
was observed. The formation of Eint is
only possible in the heavily plasticized, swollen state, whereby the
ionic acid penetrants completely bind to the polar network moieties
and thus replace the polar/hydrogen bonding network with a polyelectrolyte-like
network as described by Eint. Thus, Eint is an indication that the heavily plasticized,
swollen state has been reached, at least in the outer shell regions.
The subsequent swelling-induced physical degradation occurs due to
the stress-relief mechanisms of crazes and cracking, which lead to
surface erosion. Even when there is no core–shell swelling
observed as in the case of HCl concentration <5 M, swelling and
associated plasticization still occur throughout the epoxy specimen
with a more gradual concentration gradient. Eint still exists, but the magnitude of the dielectric contribution
is lower due to a lower degree of plasticization, which corresponds
to a lower degree of network relaxation. A comparison between the
dielectric response with mass uptake for epoxy in 3 M and 10 M HCl
is included in the Supporting Information S9.

Figure 3 Mass uptake of (A) water and (B) HCl into amine-cured epoxy R0.9 with concurrent dielectric constant measurement at
1 kHz. Schematic of the proposed interaction between the epoxy network
and either (C) water or (D) HCl. The significant increase in the dielectric
constant at the onset of the stage 2 HCl diffusion mechanism is due
to ionic polarization contribution by Eint formed when polar HCl ionic species interact with the tertiary amine
moieties and partially disassociate within the amine-cured epoxy network.
Water does not disassociate in the epoxy network; thus, no significant
increase in the dielectric constant was observed.

Changes in Surface Morphology due to Swelling during HCl Uptake
Optical monitoring of acid diffusion and reaction with cured epoxies
could be performed with in situ UV–vis spectroscopy40 and micro-ATR/FTIR,41 and often the objective was to obtain information related to the
kinetics of acid reaction with the epoxy matrix. Kinetics of acid
diffusion into cured epoxies systems could not be performed by FTIR
techniques due to the strong, broad absorbance of acids in the 3500–3000
cm–1 range. FTIR analysis in the transmission mode
tends to yield little information due to spectra saturation. Instead,
a surface characterization technique like FTIR-ATR was performed to
evaluate the physiochemical response of the epoxy exterior when immersed
in 10 M HCl acid. This technique is especially useful to evaluate
the characteristics of the swollen exterior layers due to core–shell
swelling. Sample disks of R0.9 were immersed in 10
M HCl at 60 °C and removed after 1, 2, 3, and 24 h and immediately
analyzed by FTIR-ATR. The sample disks were subsequently dried in
an oven at 180 °C for 1 h and then analyzed again by FTIR-ATR
to evaluate if HCl is physically adsorbed or covalently reacted with
the epoxy matrix.

The absorbance peak at 1510 cm–1 attributed to the stretching mode of the aromatic ring in the epoxy
monomer was identified as the invariant band. During immersion in
10 M HCl (Figure 4A),
the broad peaks corresponding to −OH and −NH bands in
the 3500–3200 cm–1 region were observed to
increase significantly in intensity with respect to the invariant
peak at 1510 cm–1 over time, attributed to the contribution
by adsorbed HCl hydrates within the amine-cured epoxy matrix. Furthermore,
it could be observed that while the initial −OH peak was centered
at 3350 cm–1, another peak at 3250 cm–1 emerged after HCl immersion, leading to formation of a plateaulike
broad peak, which could be attributed to the ionic bonding between
HCl and tertiary amine moieties within the epoxy network to form an
ammonium chloride salt complex. The formation of salts disrupts the
noncovalent polar interactions within the amine-cured epoxy matrix
and facilitates further plasticization by HCl, leading to the anomalous
diffusion behavior and the core–shell swelling as observed.
After the HCl was dried off by heating in an oven (Figure 4B), no significant deviation
was observed in the fingerprint region from 1500 to 650 cm–1, indicating that very little degradation could be attributed to
chain scission events due to acid-catalyzed hydrolytic degradation
of ether and amide linkages. Instead, the broad plateau attributed
to HCl hydrates and ammonium chloride salt complex remains despite
being lower in intensity, evident of the strong binding between HCl
and tertiary amine moieties. A further comparison between the initial R0.9 before immersion, after immersion in 10 M HCl for 24
h, and after further oven-drying has shown that other than the polar
interactions indicated by the broad peak 3500–3200 cm–1 region as explained earlier, no significant chemical degradation
reactions were observed (Figure 4C); thus, it can be concluded that the HCl acid degradation
of this amine-cured epoxy system proceeds via a physical degradation
mechanism due to swelling stress.

M HCl for up to 24 h. (B) FTIR-ATR analysis of oven-dried samples
of R0.9 after immersion in 10 M HCl. (C) Comparison
of FTIR-ATR spectra of R0.9 before and after immersion
in 10 M HCl for 24 h. No notable chemical degradation of the epoxy
network by HCl was observed due to the unchanged spectra in the fingerprint
region. (D) mDSC analysis of the HCl desorption endotherm after R0.9 immersion in 10 M HCl indicates the presence of 2 distinct
binding states between HCl and the amine-cured epoxy network.

Water is known to exist in bounded
and unbounded states within
amine-cured epoxy networks, based on dielectric studies,34 diffusion studies,18,42 and thermogravimetric analysis.43 Instead,
modulated DSC was presented in this work as another technique to concurrently
evaluate the binding states of adsorbed HCl and the extent of plasticization
of the epoxy matrix by adsorbed HCl. Again, R0.9
was immersed in 10 M HCl at 60 °C for 1, 2, and 24 h; then, the
sample was removed, wiped dry, and immediately crimped within hematic
aluminum pans for mDSC heating and cooling run cycles. The desorption
endotherm (Figure 4D) indicated that the adsorbed HCl within the epoxy matrix exists
in either unbounded or bounded states due to the presence of two distinct
endotherms, namely, below and above the boiling point of water. The
unbounded state refers to the adsorbed HCl hydrates within the free
volume of the swollen epoxy, as it would be rapidly removed upon thermal
removal of water as outgassing HCl. The bounded state corresponds
to the ammonium chloride salt complex previously described by the
FTIR-ATR study. As the HCl desorption endotherm was observed to be
broad and shifts toward higher temperatures over prolonged immersion
in 10 M HCl, the adsorbed and bounded states do not appear to be a
distinct state but rather occur as a complex distribution of bounded
states due to the amorphous nature of the amine-cured epoxy network
morphology. The shift of the endotherms toward higher temperature
is due to the increase in thermal stability of the adsorbed HCl due
to lower entropy as the acid/epoxy diffusion system approaches thermodynamic
equilibrium. Furthermore, the adsorbed HCl would increase the heat
capacity of the system by increasing the chain mobility of the amorphous
network, whereas after desorption, the system returns to its glassy
amorphous state. Therefore, the difference in heat capacity measured
during heating and cooling cycles could be used to compare the degree
of plasticization of the acid/epoxy system (Table 2). In general, longer immersion time corresponds
to more significant swelling and a higher degree of plasticization,
and the mDSC is a suitable technique to monitor such changes.

To verify
and visualize the physical degradation resulting from
the proposed swelling stress-induced cracks and the erosion mechanism,
an electron micrograph was obtained from vacuum-dried sample disks
of R0.9 immersed in 10 M HCl at 60 °C for 2,
4, and 7 h (Figure 5). The initial amine-cured epoxy surface can be considered relatively
smooth and homogeneous (Figure 5A); the particles observed on the surface can be attributed
to dust residues, which settled on the epoxy during the casting process
and is unlikely to affect the subsequent acid degradation mechanism.
After immersing in 10 M HCl for 2 h (Figure 5B), one can observe cracks, pinholes, and
pits on the specimen surface. It is important to note that the captured
electron micrograph is representative of the deswollen exterior surface
after vacuum-drying to remove HCl hydrates due to its tendency to
outgas.

of the R0.9 sample surface before (A) and after immersion
in 10 M HCl for 2 h (B), 4 h (C), and 7 h (D). Physical degradation
proceeds by (B) swelling-induced surface crack formation, (C) crack
propagation leading to exterior delamination, and (D) repetition of
crack formation and delamination leading to the observed surface erosion
mechanism.

First, the proposed mechanism
behind the formation of pinholes
can be attributed to the chemical attack by HCl on the unreacted resin
precursors or partially reacted clusters within the amine-cured epoxy
network. These clusters that are susceptible to HCl acid attack were
formed due to the vitrification of the entire network, which impedes
the subsequent diffusion of unreacted species from achieving reaction
completion. The formation of pits as observed might be caused by the
formation of HCl gas pockets from the unbounded HCl hydrates during
the drying procedure of sample preparation for FESEM imaging. Similar
pits were previously observed in injection molded ABS samples and
were attributed to volatile outgassing during molding.44 The pits were mostly observed to form at the
layer below the delaminated exterior, which supports the theory that
such pits are likely to be artifacts from sample preparation for FESEM
imaging. Lastly, the cracks did not appear to originate from any specific
defect sites and were distributed homogeneously throughout the specimen
surface. It was also obvious that the cracks propagated beneath the
exterior layers and resulted in the delamination of the surface from
the bulk. The only reasonable explanation was that the crack propagated
along the interface between the swollen exterior and the unswollen
interior bulk. As observed by the change in specimen surface degradation over a period of immersion
time, it appeared that the physical degradation occurred in cyclic
repetition between the exterior swelling (Figure 5B) followed by exterior delamination (Figure 5C) and again (Figure 5D), leading to the
observed surface erosion phenomena. While this proposed mechanism
may appear to be similar to environmental stress cracking of polymers,
the key difference in this mechanism is that the origin of the stress
source is contributed by the swelling stress and not an externally
applied stress.

Conclusions
Herein this work, a
diffusion study of amine-cured epoxy in concentrated
HCl was presented to unravel the mechanistic origins of the observed
physical degradation phenomena that were presumptuously attributed
to chemical degradation reactions previously. Through concurrent gravimetric
and dielectric monitoring, it was revealed that the diffusion mechanism
of HCl into amine-cured epoxy networks turns out to be contrastingly
different from that of the well-studied water/epoxy diffusion systems.
The partial dissociation of acid electrolyte within the epoxy network
led to the observation of an anomalous 3-stage diffusion mechanism,
which was also characterized by the concurrent sharp increase in the
dielectric constant of the HCl-swollen epoxy system due to the formation
of Eint. Further evidence that supports
the swelling-induced physical degradation as the dominant degradation
mechanism was indicated by the lack of chemical changes within the
fingerprint region of the FTIR spectra over the HCl swelling duration,
as well as the observed desorption of bounded and unbounded HCl from
the swollen epoxy matrix. Electron micrographs of the dried epoxy
specimen surfaces over a period of HCl swelling have shown characteristic
features of environment stress cracking of polymers, which was attributed
to the complementary action of the swelling-induced stress due to
the large mass uptake, with the plasticizing effect of acid on the
epoxy network leading to the erosion-type degradation mechanism observed.

Thus, the proposed epoxy/acid degradation mechanism based on the
failure analysis insights does not appear to be restricted to either
this specific epoxy system or the HCl media. Instead, the degradation
mechanisms could be generally applied to the diffusion or degradation
studies of a polar thermoset matrix immersed in concentrated electrolytes.
Therefore, specialty solvents could be designed to harness the presented
accelerated diffusion mechanism for faster, higher-yielding thermoset
disintegration processes to enable thermoset recycling or composite
fiber recovery applications. The large dielectric response could also
be used to develop in situ sensors utilizing dielectric constant measurements
with cheap handheld LCR meters to monitor the safe usage lifetime
of thermoset composites used in corrosive environments.

Experimental
Section
Materials
N,N-Diglycidyl-4-glycidyloxyaniline,
alternatively known as triglycidyl-p-aminophenol
(TGAP) epoxy resin, with epoxide equivalent 100 g mol–1 was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Bis(aminomethyl)norbornane (NBDA)
with amine hydrogen equivalent 38.5 g mol–1 was
obtained from Tokyo Chemical Industry. The liquid resin precursors
were used as received. Hydrochloric acid (37%) was obtained from Merck
and diluted to the respective concentrations (0.1–10 M) with
deionized water generated in our laboratory.

Sample Preparation
The epoxy samples were prepared
by mixing TGAP and NBDA according to predefined amine hydrogen/epoxide
equivalent molar ratios (r) of 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.0,
1.3, and 1.5, to vary the network polarity and cross-link density.
The mixtures were subsequently degassed by centrifuge and cast in
silicon molds with 1.27 cm-diameter disc cavities with depth of 2
mm. The samples were cured at 25 °C for 12 h, followed by postcuring
at 120 °C for 2 h. The cured sample disks were stored in dehumidifier
cabinets and preconditioned by overnight drying in a vacuum oven at
80 °C prior to testing (Figure 6).

Figure 6 Schematic of the experiment workflow, starting with specimen
immersion
in HCl for a specified duration, followed immediately by thickness,
mass measurements, and dielectric analysis.45 The specimen was returned to HCl immersion, and the monitoring cycle
was repeated until disintegration.

Gravimetric Measurements with Dielectric Monitoring (Figure
6)
Acid sorption studies were performed by immersing the
sample disks in hydrochloric acid of various concentrations at 60
°C. The samples were periodically removed from the acid, quenched
in deionized water twice, gently patted dry on filter paper, and immediately
measured. The sample disc thickness was measured by a Mitutoyo digital
micrometer screw gauge with precision of 0.001 mm and then weighed
with an A&D GR-202 semimicro balance with precision of 0.01 mg.
Three samples were measured for each sample set. Subsequently, one
sample was selected out of each set for measurement of its dielectric
properties using a Keysight E4980A LCR meter equipped with ASTM D150-compliant
dielectric test fixture 16451B. The dielectric test fixture based
on a parallel-plate design with gold-coated stainless steel electrodes
was cleaned with acetone before and after every measurement to remove
residues. A reference HDPE film sample was measured periodically to
ensure the equipment was within calibrated limits. The samples were
monitored until large fractures occurred. The experiment was performed
entirely within a fumehood due to the outgassing of HCl gas from the
acid swollen specimens during measurements.

Other Characterizations
Dynamic mechanical analysis
was performed with TA instruments Q800 DMA utilizing the single cantilever
mode with temperature ramp from ambient to 300 °C to estimate
the molecular weight between cross-links in accordance with the rubber
elasticity theory46 using the storage modulus
value at Tg + 40 °C according to
the following equation 5  Density measurements were
performed using
an Ultrapyc 1200e helium gas pycnometer by Quantachrome instruments.

Modulated dynamic scanning calorimetry (mDSC) was performed using
TA 2920 mDSC with aluminum pans under dry nitrogen gas. The samples
were equilibrated at −20 °C, then heated at 10 °C
min–1 with temperature modulation of 1.6 °C
min–1 up to 180 °C, followed by controlled
cooling at 10 °C min–1 with temperature modulation
of 1.6 °C min–1 until −20 °C. This
technique was able to identify different types of bonding between
the adsorbed HCl and the epoxy network, as well as a guide to determine
the degree of plasticization of the epoxy network based on the difference
in measured heat capacity between the heating and cooling cycles.

FTIR-ATR was performed using Perkin Elmer Frontier in the mid-IR
range with diamond ATR accessory from 4000 to 650 cm–1. ATR correction was performed using the algorithm included with
the accompanying Spectrum software platform to reduce spectra distortion.
This technique was performed on samples before and after drying to
understand the chemical interactions within the epoxy network at different
immersion times.

Secondary electron micrograph was obtained
using JEOL JSM-6340F
with a cold-field-emission source at an accelerating voltage of 5
kV and working distance of 7 mm. The acid-immersed samples for imaging
were prepared by quenching twice with deionized water, followed by
reduced-pressure-drying in a vacuum oven at 80 °C and −28.8
in Hg. The samples were coated with platinum prior to imaging.
