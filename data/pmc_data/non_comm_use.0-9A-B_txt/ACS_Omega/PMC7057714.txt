An
amino curing agent containing silicon/titanium flame-retardant
elements (STCA) based on (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) and
tetrabutyl titanate was successfully prepared. The thermal decomposition
and flame-retardant properties of a STCA-cured trifunctional epoxy
resin, which was facilely synthesized by 1,1,1-tris(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethane
and epichlorohydrin via a two-step method, were compared with those
of another amino curing agent containing silicon (SCA) based on APTES
and methyltrimethoxysilane. The structures of STCA and SCA were characterized
by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), 29Si NMR, and Raman
spectroscopies. The STCA-cured thermoset not only had good thermal
stability with an initial decomposition temperature of 344.8 °C
and a char yield of 52.7% at 800 °C but also exhibited the overall
improvement of flame-retardant properties. V-0 rating was achieved
using the UL-94 test, and the value of limiting oxygen index reached
33.8%. From the thermogravimetry–infrared test, the yield of
pyrolysis products of the STCA-cured thermoset was significantly decreased,
indicating the lower toxicity in contrast to the SCA-cured thermoset.
Flame-retardant performances were also investigated using the cone
calorimetry test, and the flame retardancy mechanism was studied using
scanning electron microscopy, FT-IR, and energy-dispersive spectrometry.
The results indicate that the introduction of silicon/titanium to
the system reveals the synergistic effects to promote the formation
of an intumescent, sufficient, and compact char layer during combustion,
which could effectively prevent heat, oxygen, and flame from penetrating
into the interior structure, and lead to the retardance of further
combustion.

==== Body
Introduction
Epoxy resins (EP) exhibit
many excellent comprehensive performances
such as good physical and mechanical properties, excellent electrical
insulation, high adhesive strength to many substrates, outstanding
chemical and corrosion resistance, low shrinkage while cured, and
remarkable low price.1,2 They have been widely used as
various advanced composite matrices in many fields ranging from surface
coating, adhesives, laminates, electronic/electrical industries to
automobile, shipbuilding, and space vehicles.3−6 Although EP exhibit many great
properties in various fields, their application in a heated environment
is strictly limited for a limiting oxygen index (LOI) of only 19.8%.7 Therefore, intrinsic flame retardancy still remains
an obvious disadvantage for most of the EP. Accordingly, improving
the thermal stability of EP is necessary to extend the scope of applications
in ablative materials and fire-retardant materials. Currently, there
are primarily two methods8 to modify EP
to obtain flame-retardant materials: one is to add flame retardants
into the substrate physically and the other is to introduce inorganic
flame-retardant elements to molecular chains. Compared to the former,
the latter displays favorable advantages because of the homogeneous
dispersion excluding interfacial problem between the matrix and flame
retardants.9

Traditionally, introducing
a halogenated compound into EP is an
effective method to improve resistance to flame.10 However, many of them will lead to various issues toward
environment and human health because of the toxic and corrosive smoke
released during combustion or thermolysis.11,12 In spite of severe drawback and environment-friendly development,
halogenated flame retardants are not applicable in many fields. In
recent years, considering environmental problems, halogen-free flame
retardants containing nitrogen,13 silicon,14 phosphorus,9 boron,7,15 titanium,16 and zirconium17,18 have gradually been applied in the preparation of flame-retardant
materials. In fact, the inorganic elements doped to the polymer play
an effective role in forming a thermally stable phase and improving
the thermal stability.19,20 Among them, silicon-containing
compounds are typical flame retardants that can significantly exert
thermal stability and flame retardancy for modifying EP.11,21 Polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane with three-dimensional and
cage-shaped structure has the advantages of environmental innocuousness,
good thermal and oxidative stability, and flame retardancy.22,23 Another common silicon-containing compound that has been widely
used to improve the thermal, mechanical, and insulating performances
of modifying resins is γ-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, which contains
the reactive group −NH2 that can be used as a curing
agent for EP.24−26 However, a single inorganic flame-retardant element
cannot meet the increasing requirements for advanced applications,
so the synergistic flame-retardant systems, which comprised multiple
flame-retardant elements, have attracted researchers’ attention.
The flame retardancy of materials could be significantly enhanced
by synergistic effects of multiple elements than the flame-retardant
element used alone, such as the silicon/phosphorus,27 nitrogen/phosphorus,1,28,29 silicon/boron,30,31 silicon/nitrogen, silicon/nitrogen/phosphorus,32 and silicone/boron/phosphorus33 system. Xu et al.34 synthesized
a novel flame retardant containing a P–C–N bond and
exhibiting excellent flame retardancy for epoxy thermosets. Therefore,
synthesis of flame retardants containing diverse inorganic elements
is an effective means to endow materials with great thermal stability.

In the last few years, specific curing agents have been investigated
to modify EP to enhance the properties of flame retardancy. Many of
them containing reactive groups, such as −NH2, −CONH–,
Ar-OH, anhydride, imidazole-type, and so forth, can be employed in
functional structure designing for EP such that it can endow EP with
special performances. Functionalizing a curing agent with a reactive
group is a remarkable method to cross-link into epoxy networks and
obviously improve the compatibility. Deng et al.7 held the opinion that developing novel curing agents may
be more imperative than producing new kinds of EP in some respects.
Researchers have paid much attention on curing agents with flame retardancy
for facilitating curing and introducing heat resistance. Liu et al.35 performed a novel inorganic–organic amination
of the hybrid charged membrane through 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane,
tetrabutyl titanate (TBT), and trimethyl amine, and the new material
doped with silicon and titanium exhibited much higher thermal stability.
Tan et al.36 designed and synthesized a
novel flame-retarding curing agent based on ammonium polyphosphate,
which was used in cation exchange with diethylenetriamine.

It
is well known that the existence of the metal in the polymer
shows an efficient effect on forming a thermally stable phase and
even facilitates the cross-linking of partial bonds, thus enhancing
the thermal stability of the material.37 Therefore, it is a common approach to dope metals into polymers
in order to endow the material with better flame retardancy. There
are usually two means: (1) a certain reaction by a covalent bond and
(2) dispersion as inorganic clusters.38 Zhang et al.39 reported that the introduction
of titanium to the polymer strongly increases the decomposition temperature
and enhances the char yield.

In our work, 1,1,1-tris(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethane
(THPE), epichlorohydrin
(ECH), and NaOH were used to synthesize the epoxy resin called THPE
triglycidyl ether (THPE-TE), which contains three units of benzene
ring with the characteristic of thermal endurance and three units
of epoxy group with the effect of reactive ability, and it can be
used for blending with solid curing agents at room temperature. Besides,
we constructed two curing agents containing silicon/titanium flame-retardant
elements (STCA) and silicon only (SCA), respectively, and the chemical
structures of synthetic compounds were characterized. The thermal
analysis, flame retardancy, and flame-retardant mechanism of STCA-cured
THPE-TE were evaluated and compared with SCA-cured THPE-TE by some
characterization techniques, including LOI, UL-94, dynamic mechanical
analysis (DMA), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), thermogravimetry-infrared
(TG-IR), cone calorimetry (CC) test, scanning electron microscopy
(SEM), and energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS).

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
and Characterization of THPE-TE
THPE-TE was
facilely synthesized via ring-opening addition and ring-closing reactions,
and the synthesis route of THPE-TE is shown in Scheme 1. From the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR)
spectra of THPE and THPE-TE shown in Figure 1a,b, it can be seen that THPE and THPE-TE
have basically the same absorption peak positions. However, the broad
absorption band at about 3300 cm–1 in Figure 1a is assigned to the phenolic
hydroxyl, while it nearly disappears in Figure 1b, demonstrating that the reaction among
THPE, ECH, and NaOH was nearly complete. The characteristic peak of
ph–O–C– is found at around 1290 cm–1 in Figure 1b, which
further confirms the existence of ph–O–CH2–. The strong absorption peak around 916 cm–1 is ascribed to the epoxy ring.40 The
results indicated that we successfully incorporated the epoxy group
into the molecule structure of THPE.

and (c) 1H NMR spectrum of THPE-TE.

Scheme 1 Schematic Procedures of Synthesis for THPE-TE
To further verify the successful synthesis of THPE-TE, 1H NMR spectroscopy was used to analyze the chemical structure
of
THPE-TE. As shown in Figure 1c, the chemical shifts are assigned as follows: 6.93–7.03
ppm (a, Ar-H, 6H), 6.76–6.85 ppm (b, Ar-H, 6H), 3.89–3.98
and 4.16–4.22 ppm (c, −CH2–, 6H),
3.34 ppm (d, epoxy ring, 3H), 2.74–2.75 and 2.85–2.91
ppm (e, epoxy ring, 6H), and 2.09 ppm (f, −CH3,
3H). We listed the integral areas of the resonance peaks in Figure 1c, the ratio of integral
area among different hydrogens was 1.00:0.99:0.97:0.47:0.98:0.48,
which was similar to the theoretical ratio of 6:6:6:3:6:3. Conclusively,
the results of FT-IR and 1H NMR obtained indicated that
we successfully synthesized THPE-TE.

Structural Characterization
of SCA and STCA
Scheme 2 shows the synthesis
process of SCA and STCA via a cohydrolytic condensation reaction.
The molecular weight and molecular weight distribution of SCA and
STCA are shown in Table S1. FT-IR spectroscopy,
Raman spectroscopy, and solid-state 29Si NMR spectroscopy
were employed to characterize the structures. From Figure 2a, it is evident that the double
absorption peaks at 3450 and 3335 cm–1 are assigned
to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching of −NH2, respectively, and the infrared peak at 1620 cm–1 is ascribed to its bending vibration. The characteristic absorption
peak appearing at 1040 cm–1 illustrates the presence
of −Si–O–Si–.41 The new vibration bands near 920 and 500 cm–1 are
associated with Si–O–Ti42 and Ti–O–Ti bonds,43 respectively,
which are not observed in the spectrum of SCA.

Figure 2 (a) FT-IR spectra and
(b) Raman spectra of SCA and STCA.

Scheme 2 Reaction Equations of (a) SCA and (b) STCA
The Raman spectra also proved the presence of Si–O–Ti
bond. As shown in Figure 2b, the Raman spectra of SCA and STCA are similar in most of
the ranges. Nonetheless, the peaks at 491 and 1083 cm–1 are seen in the spectrum of STCA and are not observed in the spectrum
of SCA, which are ascribed to the bending and asymmetric vibrations
of Si–O–Ti, proving the formation of Si–O–Ti
through a dehydration reaction. These structures are related to tetrahedrally
coordinated silicon and titanium centers.44

The solid-state 29Si-NMR spectra of new curing
agents
are displayed in Figure 3. Different grafted organosiloxane units are defined as the structures
of M, D, T, and Q, which represent the units of R3SiO0.5, R2Si(O0.5)2, R1Si(O0.5)3, and Si(O0.5)4, respectively, where R represents the aromatic and/or aliphatic
substituents or H.45 (3-Aminopropyl)triethoxysilane
(APTES) and methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMS) contain only T0 [Tm: RSi(OSi≡)m(OH)3–m] silicon after hydrolysis
separately, while after the self-dehydration reaction or catalytic
reaction, the final product contains T3 silicon. As shown
in Figure 4, the characteristic
signal at δ ≈ −68 ppm can be attributed to T3 [H3C–Si(OSi≡)3] silicon,46 suggesting that most of the MTMS was hydrolyzed
and dehydrated to form Si–O–Si bonds. The sharp signal
at δ ≈ −77 ppm is assigned to T3 (−H2C–Si(OSi≡)3) silicon, suggesting
that Si–O–Si bonds are newly formed by the self-dehydration
reaction of APTES or the condensation of APTES and MTMS. However,
the intensity of the signal for T3 groups decreased in
the spectrum of STCA, which is corresponded to the reduction of Si–O–Si
due to the introduction of the new element of titanium to the system
and replacing the part place of silicon, which was consistent with
the results of FT-IR analysis.

Flame-Retardant Performances
LOI
and UL-94 Tests
As is well known, LOI and UL-94
vertical burning tests are generally employed to evaluate the flame-retardant
properties of EP thermosets. Tables 1 and 2 show the formulas, cross-link
density (νe), and flame retardancy for STCA-/SCA-cured
THPE-TE. It can be seen that with the increased content of curing
agents, the values of LOI are gradually improved, and the corresponding
UL-94 ratings are also improved from V-2 to V-0. After the curing
agent content of SCA and STCA reaches 58.3 and 56.5 wt %, respectively,
the LOI value reaches 31.4 and 33.8%, respectively. Apart from that,
the UL-94 ratings achieved the highest level of V-0. Then, the data
of the three tests tend to be steady with the increased content of
the curing agent. Under the same content of EP/SCA and EP/STCA, EP/STCA
exhibits an increased LOI and νe value. The results
indicate that the curing agents for EP exhibited excellent flame-retardant
properties, further revealing that STCA possesses better flame retardancy
than SCA for EP. Undoubtedly, there is a synergistic effect of silicon/titanium
flame-retardant elements on flame retardancy for EP/STCA compared
with EP/SCA.

a CC test.

To investigate the combustion
performances of cured EP, the CC
test is usually used to obtain the concerned data, which could provide
references on the real fire disaster. The characteristic parameters
of CC test, including time to ignition (TTI), heat release rate (HRR),
peak HRR (pHRR), total heat release (THR), time of peak HRR (tpHRR), smoke production rate (SPR), total smoke
production (TSP), CO production (COP), CO2 production (CO2P), total oxygen consumption (TOC), and effective heat combustion
(EHC), are obtained and employed to study the combustion behaviors
of the ablative materials. By combining the data in Tables 1 and 2 and Figure S1, EP/SCA-5 and EP/CTCA-4
were chosen as a contrast group.

The related data of combustion
behaviors of pure EP, EP/SCA-5,
and EP/STCA-4 obtained from the CC test with an incident flux of 50
kW/m2 are given in Table 3. TTI is generally used as an indicator to measure
the difficulty of flame retardancy on ignitability,47 and the value is defined as the beginning of the HRR curve.
EP/STCA-4 has a slightly higher TTI than EP/SCA-5, and the result
may be ascribed to the introduction of titanium to the system, which
weakens the EP thermoset to ignition. HRR, pHRR, and THR are considered
as the important parameters to evaluate the fire size and safety.47 Generally speaking, a good flame retardant tends
to exhibit lower values of HRR, pHRR, and THR. Figure 4a,b shows the HRR and THR curves of EP/SCA-5
and EP/STCA-4, where we can see that EP/SCA-5 burns rapidly after
ignition and reaches the first peak point promptly with a value of
288 kW/m2 at 60 s, much higher than that of EP/STCA-4 (218
kW/m2) at 65 s. For EP/SCA-5, the second peak appears at
170 s and attributes to the ulterior decomposition of the anteriorly
formed loose char. The fast surface combustion and immediate char
layer formation, as well as further decomposition, correspond to the
lack of fire resistance of the material and further explain that the
silicon alone does not exert effective flame retardancy.

Besides that, by comparing
the THR data of EP/SCA-5 and EP/STCA-4,
the former also showed a slight increase by 13.8%. On the basis of
these results, EP/STCA-4 reveals better flame retardancy than EP/SCA-5,
and it is attributed to the introduction of titanium to the curing
agent, resulting in the formation of a Si–O–Ti bond.
After combustion, the formation of a synergistic silicon/titanium-rich
char shield stops the residual carbon from further rupturing. In addition,
it refrains the heat and oxygen from entering into the interior structure
in case of burning in a deep environment. In conclusion, EP/STCA-4
holds better thermal stability and flame retardancy than EP/SCA-5.

The production of smoke and toxic gases is also considered as a
vital aspect for the application of flame-retardant materials because
smoke and toxic gases are the main threats to human life in case of
real fire.48 From SPR–time plots
shown in Figure 4c,d,
it can be seen that the SPR curve of EP/SCA-5 presents two obvious
peak points and the value is far higher than that of EP/STCA-4, which
exhibits lower TSR value than EP/SCA-5. The value of TSP also reduced
from 36.35 m2/kg for EP/SCA-5 to 31.95 m2/kg
for EP/STCA-4. From the data of COP and CO2P given in Table 3, we can conclude
that the values of EP/SCA-5 are higher than that of EP/STCA-4, and
the result was consistent with the TG-IR analysis. The main reason
is that the introduction of titanium into the system stimulates the
formation of a silicon/titanium-rich compact char layer, which can
be used as a protective layer on the surface.16 Moreover, it can suppress the heat from entering the interior structure,
as well as restrict the intensity of combustion and decrease the quantity
of smoke release.

The EHC is defined as the ratio of the total
heat to per mass loss,
which reflects the combustion degree of volatile gases in the gas
phase, and is useful for analyzing the flame-retardant mechanism.
The lower EHC value indicates the existence of noncombustible gas
in gas phase. As presented in Table 3, compared with the average value of EHC (av-EHC) for
EP/SCA-5, the av-EHC for EP/STCA-4 decreased from 19.05 to 16.50 MJ/kg.
The result may be due to two reasons: on the one hand, the thermoset
could produce noncombustible gases during the combustion process,
which can act as an efficient dilution effect on the flammable gases
and oxygen concentration around the system, avoiding the rapid burning
of the material; on the other hand, the flame retardant containing
silicon and titanium can form a condensed phase during the combustion
and reach the effect of flame inhibition. As a result, the nonflammable
gases and the formation of a condensed phase play important roles
during the combustion process.

The ablative behavior of the
flame-retardant material is generally
estimated by calculating the mass loss rate (MLR), which is defined
as the mass loss per second, and the related data are summarized in Table 4. Compared to the
MLR of 0.0605 g/s for EP/SCA-5, the MLR for EP/STCA-4 decreases to
30.4% (0.0421 g/s). Generally speaking, lower MLR manifests that the
material has a lower erosion rate under heat and flame, so the result
clearly suggests that EP/STCA-4 has a prominently improved antiflame
behavior after the introduction of titanium.

EP/SCA-5	34.000	12.537	40–395	0.0605	
EP/STCA-4	33.600	18.036	45–415	0.0421	
Thermal Properties
Dynamic
Mechanical Analysis
DMA was used to obtain
the loss tangent (tan δ) spectrum of cured epoxy resins. Glass-transition
temperature (Tg) is a significant application
parameter for EP thermosets, which reflects the minimum temperature
of the polymer transforming from glass state to high elastic state.
It could be calculated by the spectrum of tan δ, corresponding
to the temperature of the location of the peak of tan δ. As
can be seen in Figure 5, the Tg for EP/SCA-5 and EP/STCA-4 are
165 and 176 °C, respectively. This result is mainly attributed
to the higher cross-link density of EP/STCA-4 and the introduction
of Si–O–Ti bonds to the structure enhancing the rigidity,49 which leads to the rotational barrier of epoxy
resin and other groups, ultimately increasing the Tg of the EP/STCA-4 thermoset. With the higher Tg, it shows that EP/STCA-4 possesses better
heat resistance and extended application fields, especially in thermal
environment.

Figure 5 DMA curves of EP/SCA-5 and EP/STCA-4.

Thermogravimetric Analysis
Thermal stability and thermal
degradation properties were evaluated by TGA under nitrogen atmosphere.
The TGA and derivative thermogravimetry (DTG) curves of pure EP, EP/SCA-5,
and EP/STCA-4 are shown in Figure 6. The detailed data are listed in Table S2. It can be seen that the thermal degradation behavior
of the two samples has three decomposition steps. EP/SCA-5 begins
to decompose at 299.6 °C and reaches the first degradation peak
at 310.8 °C with a maximum weight loss rate of 7.77 wt %/min,
which is attributed to the rupture of small side groups such as −CH3 and Si–CH3, and degradation as well as
carbonization of the backbone including the C–C and C–O
bonds. For EP/STCA-4, the temperatures of initial thermal degradation
and the peak of first step increased to 348.8 and 358.4 °C, respectively.
The maximum weight loss rate decreased by 26.5% to 5.71 wt %/min compared
to that of EP/SCA-5 because of lack of Si–CH3; also,
the bond dissociation energy (BDE) of C–C (346 kJ/mol) and
C–O (345 kJ/mol) is higher compared with that of Si–C
(318 kJ/mol).11,50 Next, the second degradation
step of EP/SCA-5 appears at 372.9 °C, similarly for EP/STCA-4
at 402.2 °C, owing to the degradation of previously formed char
layer of EP thermosets. The maximum weight loss rates of the third
decomposition stage for EP/SCA-5 and EP/STCA-4 are about 0.84 wt %
at 474.1 °C and 0.77 wt % at 534.2 °C, respectively. This
phenomenon can be considered as the break and rearrangement of the
partial Si–O–Si and Si–O–Ti bonds on the
main chain and the further combustion of the remaining organic groups.51 Notably, the maximum weight loss of EP/SCA-5
is relatively higher than that of EP/STCA-4, as a result of the presence
of Si–O–Ti which is of higher BDE compared with the
Si–O–Si unit. Therefore, the residual yield of EP/STCA-4
is increased from 51.1% for EP/SCA-5 to 52.7% at 800 °C with
a lower original ratio of the curing agent. Silicon-containing polymers
are regarded as tending to form thermally stable silica when degraded
at high temperature. Meanwhile, the catalytic effect of titanium makes
a great contribution to enhance the formation of char layer during
thermal degradation.51 Moreover, the formed
silicon/titanium-rich sufficient and compact char layer is strongly
capable of restraining heat from penetrating into underlying material,
avoiding further decomposition. The result indicates that high residual
yield plays an effective role in flame retardancy, and the interaction
of silicon/titanium has a synergistic effect on the enhancement of
thermal stability.

Figure 6 (a) TGA and (b) DTG curves of EP/SCA-5 and EP/STCA-4.

In order to evaluate the thermal stability of the
prepared cured
resins, the statistic heat-resistant index (Ts) was put forward. It is calculated by the temperatures of
5% weight loss (T5wt%) and 30% weight
loss (T30wt%) of the specimen from TGA.
The Ts is defined by eq 1(52,53) 1  

The Ts value of
EP/STCA-4 is 191.08,
higher than that of EP/SCA-5 (168.97), explaining that the STCA-cured
EP has a better heat resistance. The lower heat degradation of EP/STCA-4
is due to the abound presence of Si–O–Ti and Ti–O–Ti
bonds, which leads to stronger rigidity and improved heat resistance.
Moreover, the comparison of thermal properties and combustion performances
between different thermosets is summarized in Figure S2, Tables S3 and S4.

Gas-Phase Analysis
TG-IR is usually conducted to detect
the gaseous phase so as to further analyze the decomposition process.
In order to further clarify the important effect on flame retardancy
of the synergy of silicon and titanium, the TG-IR spectra of volatile
products of EP/SCA-5 and EP/STCA-4 at different degradation temperatures
are obtained and presented in Figure 7. The intensive characteristic signals of H2O (3644 cm–1), hydrocarbons (2972 cm–1), CO2 (2360 cm–1), aromatic compounds
(1610, 1510 cm–1), and ether compounds (1260, 1184
cm–1) are nearly similar between the two samples.
Moreover, for EP/SCA-5, the intensive peaks of 3644 and 1600–2000
cm–1 begin to appear at 310 °C, but the obvious
signals cannot be seen until the temperature rises to 340 °C
for EP/STCA-4, which indicates that the occurrence of the degradation
process for EP/STCA-4 is later than that of EP/SCA-5 and accords with
the results of TGA discussed above. This phenomenon reveals that the
introduction of titanium retards the decomposition of cured EP. Besides
that, the absorption intensity of the main gaseous products decreases
compared to that of EP/SCA-5.

Figure 7 TG-IR spectra of (a) EP/SCA-5 and (b) EP/STCA-4
at different temperatures.

To further compare the thermal decomposition of the two cured EP, Figure 8 exhibits the curves
of some characteristic absorbance intensity of volatile products versus
temperature. After the incorporation of titanium to the thermoset,
it can be seen that the characteristic absorbance intensity of carbon
dioxide (2360 cm–1), carbon monoxide (2190 cm–1), and aromatic compounds (1510, 1610 cm–1) as well as that of total pyrolysis products decrease significantly
to lower values. The result is due to the strong molecular structure
and the formed compact and continual residual char after decomposition,
which blocks the spread of pyrolysis products. The decrease of aromatic
compounds attributed to the smoke suppression and the decrease of
CO could reduce the toxicity of smoke. In summary, with the introduction
of silicon and titanium to the thermoset, the fire safety has improved
a lot compared to the thermoset only containing silicon.

Flame-Retardant Mechanism
For the purpose of further
elucidating the relationship between the flame-retardant mechanism
and the morphology of the char residue, the digital pictures and SEM
micrographs of EP/SCA-5 and EP/STCA-4 after CC test were obtained
and shown in Figure 9. It is obvious that EP/STCA-4 presents efficient coherent intumescent
char residue and gathers into a dense cluster in most areas. Moreover,
the char layer of EP/STCA-4 is continuous and compact with almost
no cracks. However, EP/SCA-5 apparently exhibited loose structure,
including some long cracks and hole-like structures. Some pieces of
char layers nearly separate from the main body without sufficient
cohesion because EP/SCA-5 almost decomposes entirely; thus, it causes
inadequate char formation during combustion. As shown in Figure 9b2,b3, the exterior
char layer of EP/STCA-4 appears a relatively complete and homogeneous
structure with a rough surface. Therefore, heat, flame, and oxygen
can be prevented from entering into the interior structure. Besides,
this dense char structure would effectively avert the escape of volatiles,
resulting in the retardance of further combustion. Therefore, the
results suggest that the introduction of a Si–O–Ti structure
has a huge benefit for the enhancement of flame retardancy of EP/STCA-4.
It may effectively restrain heat transfer. On the contrary, the char
layer of EP/SCA-5 sample consists of multihole structure, which was
probably attributed to the release of a large amount of gas.54 Thereafter, the structures extend from the surface
to the interior structure; as a result, oxygen and flame have greater
access to penetrate into the interior structure, leading to further
burning until full combustion.

Figure 9 Digital images of the char residues after
CC test: (a1) EP/SCA-5
and (b1) EP/STCA-4; SEM micrographs of the char residues after CC
test: (a2,a3) EP/SCA-5 and (b2,b3) EP/STCA-4.

In order to further investigate the flame-retardant mechanism,
FT-IR and EDX were used to characterize the chemical structure of
the char residue to observe the synergistic effects of silicon and
titanium. The FT-IR spectrum of the char residue of EP/STCA-4 after
CC test is displayed in Figure 10. The absorption peak of 1590 cm–1 is ascribed to the C=C stretching vibration of aromatic carbons,
and the characteristic peaks at 1060, 920, and 460 cm–1 prove the presence of Si–O–Si, Si–O–Ti,
and Ti–O–Ti bonds as ever. The results indicate that
these bonds exhibit thermal stability under combustion as well as
promote the formation of a solid and compact char layer containing
silicon and titanium, enhancing the thermal stability of the char
residue. Therefore, it could be capable of exerting the resistance
to flame, resulting in good flame retardancy of EP/STCA-4.

Figure 10 FT-IR spectra
of the char residue for EP/STCA-4 after the CC test.

EDS is an effective tool to detect the elemental content
of the
char residue after CC test, so that we could analyze the differences
between the exterior char and the interior char after combustion.
As shown in Figure 11, it can be seen that the O, Si, and Ti contents of the exterior
char were higher than those of the interior char because of the direct
exposure to the air of the exterior char. During the combustion, silicic
and titaniferous groups could generate SiO2 and TiO2 to promote char formation.11,51 Furthermore,
they probably form a silicon/titanium ceramic structure to enhance
the thermal stability and flame retardancy of the char. Therefore,
the formation of oxygen, silicon/titanium-rich char effectively prevents
the interior composition from further decomposition, reflecting the
synergistic effects to improve thermal stability.

interior and (b) exterior char residues of
EP/STCA-4.

Mechanical Properties
Stress–strain curves of
EP/SCA-5 and EP/STCA-4 are shown in Figure 12, and the detailed data of tensile properties
and KIC of EP/SCA-5 and EP/STCA-4 are
summarized in Table 5. Compared to the −Si–O–Ti– bond, the
flexible −Si–O–Si– molecular chains have
a significant effect to decrease the cross-link density and rigidity
of the cured epoxy resin, which led to the reduction of tensile strength
of EP/CSA-5. Besides, the bond angle of −Si–O–Si–
is 142°, which is more open than that of the usual tetrahedral
with 110°. Thanks to these structural characteristics, the −Si–O–Si–
skeleton is endowed with excellent flexible performance and stress
dissipating capability, which plays an effective role in the improvement
of ductility, resulting in the increase of failure strain.

Figure 12 Stress–strain
curves of EP/SCA-5 and EP/STCA-4.

Table 5 Tensile Properties and KIC of the Samples
sample	tensile strength
(MPa)	failure strain (%)	KIC (MPa m1/2)	
EP/SCA-5	89.65 ± 2.76	6.12 ± 0.31	2.33 ± 0.18	
EP/STCA-4	94.13 ± 3.54	5.64 ± 0.27	2.13 ± 0.22	
As shown in Table 5, after the incorporation of titanium to
the epoxy thermoset, the KIC of the EP/STCA-4
reaches 2.13 MPa m1/2, only decreased by 8.6% compared
with that of EP/SCA-5. Therefore,
the fracture toughness of silicon/titanium-containing epoxy resin
was not deeply affected by the introduction of titanium, and EP/STCA-4
exhibits high strength and relatively good toughness. The comparison
of mechanical properties between different thermosets is displayed
in Figure S3 and Table S5.

Conclusions
In order to simplify
the procedure to prepare a flame-retardant
thermoset, the curing agents of SCA and STCA containing flame-retardant
elements were successfully synthesized and characterized. EP/STCA
exhibits improved flame retardancy compared to EP/SCA, especially
for EP/STCA-4. DMA test showed that the introduction of titanium to
the curing agent significantly improves the Tg value of the composite. The temperature of maximum decomposition
rate for EP/STCA-4 was shifted to a higher value, and the char yield
was also increased at 800 °C by contrast with EP/SCA, indicating
that the incorporation of titanium effectively enhanced the thermal
stability. With the addition of STCA reaching 56.5%, V-0 rating was
achieved and its LOI value attained 33.8%, higher than that of EP/SCA.
The CC test showed that the av-HRR, pHRR, THR, pSPR, and TSP values
of EP/STCA-4 were decreased. The yield of the gas products detected
by the TG-IR technique reduced after the introduction of titanium.
Moreover, the SEM results indicated that EP/STCA-4 had a more uniform
and denser char layer than EP/SCA-5 because of the presence of abundant
aromatic structure, Si–O–Ti, Ti–O–Ti bonds.
The continual compact char layer was helpful to form a physical barrier
to isolate oxygen, heat, and volatile gas from spreading to the interior
structure. Because of the introduction of titanium to the curing agent,
the synergistic effects of silicon and titanium precipitated the formation
of sufficient and compact char layer during combustion, which led
to better flame retardancy and thermal stability. Besides, EP/STCA-4
exhibits high strength and relatively good toughness.

Materials and
Methods
Materials
THPE (99%) was purchased from Beijing HWRK
Chemical Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). ECH (AR) and tetrabutyl ammonium
bromide [TBAB, AR, ≥99.0%] were provided by Shanghai Dibai
Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Sodium hydroxide (NaOH,
AR, ≥96%), APTES (AR), MTMS (AR), acetylacetone (Acac, AR),
anhydrous ethanol (C2H5OH, ≥99.7%), hydrochloric
acid (36.0–38.0%), and deionized water were obtained from Shanghai
Titan Scientific Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). TBT (≥98.0%)
was supplied by Shanghai Lingfeng Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai,
China).

Synthesis of THPE-TE
The synthesis procedure for THPE-TE
is shown in Scheme 1. THPE (0.1 mol), ECH (3.6 mol), and TBAB (0.5 mol % of THPE) were
mixed proportionally in a 1000 mL four-necked flask under nitrogen
atmosphere, equipped with a heating device, stirrer, thermometer.
The resulting mixture was stirred, and the temperature was maintained
at 105 °C for 2 h. After the completion of the first step of
ring-opening addition reaction, the reactive system was used to cool
the solution to 70 °C. Then, NaOH (0.35 mol) was evenly added
to the system to catalyze the ring-closing reaction, and the second
step reaction was continued for 2 h. After that, the solution was
eluted with distilled water at 70 °C several times until the
system turned to a neutral solution. At last, excess ECH was removed
under reduced pressure and THPE-TE was obtained.

Synthesis of
SCA
SCA was prepared by a cohydrolytic
condensation reaction. APTES (0.5 mol, 110.5 g), MTMS (0.5 mol, 68
g), and 100 mL of anhydrous ethanol were added into a 500 mL four-necked
flask with a stirrer, efflux condenser, and oil bath heater under
nitrogen purge. The reaction system was heated to 60 °C, and
then, 36 g of H2O and dilute hydrochloric acid was added
dropwise to catalyze the hydrolysis and condensation reaction until
the pH value of the reaction system reached 3–4. The mixture
was maintained at 60 °C for 12 h and distilled under reduced
pressure at 60 °C to remove the byproducts of water, methanol,
and ethanol. The synthetic route of SCA is given in Scheme 2a.

Synthesis of STCA
The synthetic process is shown in Scheme 2b. It was synthesized
by sol–gel process and a cohydrolytic condensation reaction.
APTES (58.5 g), TBT (34 g), Acac (3 g), and anhydrous ethanol (150
mL) as the solvent were added into a 500 mL four-necked flask equipped
with a mechanical stirrer, reflux condenser, thermocouple, and a nitrogen
inlet. The mixture was heated to 50 °C and maintained at that
temperature for 1 h to accomplish the chelation of Acac to decrease
the reactivity and stabilize the sol. Then, 36 g of deionized water
was added to the mixture at a constant speed within 2 h to hydrolyze
APTES and TBT. After rising at a temperature of 120 °C, 8 mL
of hydrochloric acid was divided equally into four batches and added
to the reaction system batchwise every half an hour. Then, the pale
yellow liquid was distilled under reduced pressure at 70 °C to
remove water, ethanol, and butyl alcohol. Finally, the new solid curing
agent was ultimately obtained.

Preparation of Cured Epoxy
Resin Specimens
The cured
specimens were obtained by using a thermal curing process. The ratio
of the curing agent (SCA or STCA) was calculated, and THPE-TE was
stirred for 10 min at 1000 rpm in a dispersion machine and well mixed
to form a homogeneous mixture. The mixture was added into the prepared
molds and cured in a nitrogen convection oven. The samples were cured
under the following conditions: 120 °C/2 h, 150 °C/3 h,
and 180 °C/3 h. After that, the samples were cooled to room temperature
slowly to avoid cracking and then used for testing. The detailed formula
of cured resins is summarized in Tables 1 and 2.

Characterization
FT-IR spectra were obtained using
a Nicolet 6700 infrared spectrometer at room temperature to characterize
the chemical structure of THPE-TE and curing agents. The samples were
thoroughly mixed with KBr and then pressed into small flakes.

The1H NMR spectrum of THPE-TE was obtained using a Bruker
AVANCE III-400 MHz NMR spectrometer with deuterochloroform (CDCl3) as a solvent and tetramethylsilane as an internal standard.
The 29Si NMR spectra of new curing agents were recorded
on a Bruker AVANCE III-500 MHz NMR spectrometer.

Raman spectra
were obtained in a Renishaw inVia Raman spectrometer
equipped with a 633 nm wavelength excitation laser, recorded in the
range of 3500–100 cm–1.

The LOI value
measurement was performed using a JF-3 oxygen index
meter (Jiangning Analysis Instrument Company, China) with bar dimensions
130 × 6.5 × 3.0 mm3 according to the ISO 4589-2:2006
standard. UL-94 tests were conducted on the NK8017A instrument (Nklsky
Instrument Company, Ltd., China) with dimensions 130 × 13 ×
3 mm3 according to the ASTM D3801-19 standard. The results
of burning grade were denoted as NR (No Rating), V-2, V-1, V-0, and
V-0, which were defined as the best flame retardancy of the refractory
material. CC tests were performed on an FTT CC (West Sussex, UK) at
an incident heat flux of 50 kW/m2 in accordance with the
ISO 5660 standard, and the dimension of the samples was 100 ×
100 × 3 mm3. Before testing, the samples were put
on aluminum foil and wrapped to make only the top surfaces directly
exposed to the heat source. Every sample is tested at least three
times.

The cross-linking density of the corresponding cured
EP was analyzed
with a IIC XLDS-15 analyzer at room temperature.

DMA was performed
on a TA DMA Q800 thermal analysis instrument
in air atmosphere, and the sample with dimensions 30 × 10 ×
4 mm3 were tested in a three-point bending configuration
at a heating rate of 3 °C/min and a frequency of 1 Hz from 25
to 250 °C. The glass-transition temperature was obtained on the
basis of the curve of loss tangent with the increase of temperature.

TGA was performed on a TA Instrument Q500 at a heating rate of
10 °C/min and a gas flow of 20 mL/min from ambient temperature
to 800 °C under air and nitrogen atmosphere, respectively.

TG-IR spectra were recorded with a TGA Q5000 thermogravimetric
analyzer, which is interfaced by a Nicolet 6700 FT-IR spectrometer.
Approximately 10.0 mg of sample was tested from 25 to 800 °C
at a heating rate of 10 °C/min under nitrogen atmosphere with
at a flow rate of 20 mL/min.

Morphological analysis on the residual
chars after CC test was
conducted on a field-emission scanning electron microscope (Hitachi
S-4800) at an acceleration voltage of 15 kV. The field-emission scanning
electron microscope instrument was equipped with an EDS microanalyzer
to perform elemental analysis.

Tensile properties were studied
using a GOTECH AI-700 M testing
machine (GOTECH Testing Machines Inc., China) according to ASTM D638-99
at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min. The fracture toughness (KIC) was tested using a single-edge notched bend
test according ASTM D5045-14 at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min. KIC
was calculated as follows 2   3   4  where P is the applied load; S is the span of the sample; and D, W, and a are the thickness, width, and
crack length of the sample, respectively. At least 10 replicate specimens
were tested.
