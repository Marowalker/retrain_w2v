Newer imidazolium ionic liquid (IL)
halides 4a–f appending variety of fluorinated
phenylacetamide side chains were designed and synthesized through
quaternization of 1-methyl and/or 1,2-dimethylimidazole with appropriate
2-chloro-N-(fluorinatedphenyl)acetamides. The resulting
ILs were converted to their respective ionic liquid analogues carrying
fluorinated counteranions (PF6–, BF4–, and/or CF3COO–) 5a–r. All newly synthesized ILs were fully
characterized using several spectroscopic experiments such as 1H, 13C, 11B, 19F, 31P NMR, and mass analysis. The synthesized ionic liquids were investigated
for their DNA binding and anticancer activities. The obtained DNA
binding constants ranged from 1.444 × 105 to 3.518
× 105, indicating a reasonably good binding affinity.
The percentage of anticancer activities ranged from 48 to 59 with
H-1229 cell line, showing quite good anticancer potential. The modeling
studies indicated the interactions of the reported molecules with
DNA via hydrogen bonds. These were in agreement with
those of DNA binding and anticancer results. Briefly, the designed
ionic liquids may be used as good anticancer candidates for treating
human cancer.

1 Introduction
The drug
discovery is at the
cutting edge of the most promising medicinal chemistry. The drug design
is at a crossroad, facing growing strategies for the synthesis of
new active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).1 These strategies faced several challenges in the development of
such scaffolds for effective drug delivery. These challenges are further
exacerbated when drug compounds resulted from the combination of simple
and active moieties with unique and tunable physicochemical and biological
properties. Consequently, the development of potent anticancer agents
is a major trend in drug discovery efforts in medicinal chemistry.1,2 Ionic liquids (ILs) have been a topic of great interest in organic
synthesis owing to their potential pharmaceutical properties and hold
an important challenge in medicinal chemistry, especially in the race
to synthesize new therapeutic agents or active pharmaceutical ingredients
(APIs) tethered such moieties.3 Generally,
ILs are synthesized by combining organic cations such as imidazolium,
pyridinium, ammonium, guanidinium, and phosphonium4 with a wide variety of anions including halides (Cl–, Br–), hexafluorophosphate (PF6–), tetrafluoroborate (BF4–), trifluoroacetate (CF3COO–), bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amide (NTf2), and dicyanamide
(DCA).5 These classes of ILs are well known
as tunable molecules with unique physicochemical properties including
low flammability, extremely low vapor pressure at room temperature,
high ionic conductivity, and high thermal and chemical stabilities.6 By modifying the cations and anions with special
functional groups, all these properties may be adjustable with fascinating
applications such as antiviral,7 antibacterial,8 antifungal,9 anti-inflammatory,10 and anticancer11 activities.

In addition, several studies have been devoted to the use of ILs
as antitumor agents against several human cancer cells such as breast,12 brain,13 colon,14 lung,15 liver,16 osteosarcomas,17 leukemia,
and prostate.18 In view of encouraging
observations and as a continuation of our interest in the development
of novel functionalized bioactive ionic liquids,19−27 we
have anticipated the synthesis of novel imidazolium-ionic liquids
carrying fluorinated phenylacetamide. The synthesized ILs were tested
with DNA binding and screened for their anticancer activities. Additionally,
simulation studies were also investigated to determine the anticancer
mechanism.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Chemistry
A more
holistic approach to design the desired imidazolium ionic liquids 4a–f and 5a–r is described in Scheme 1 and comprises quaternization
and metathesis reactions.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Ionic Liquids Bearing Imidazole
Ring and Fluorinated Phenylacetamide Linkages 4a–f and 5a–r
Thus, the quaternization of sp2 nitrogen atom of the substituted imidazoles 1 and/or 2 was carried out through their thermal alkylation
by some aromatic acetamide chlorides 3a–c for
2 h to afford the halogenated IL-based imidazolium–amide hybrids 4a–f in 83–90% yields (Table 1).

Table 1 Physical and Analytical Data for the
Imidazolium IL Halides 4a–f
It should be noted that the fluorinated
phenyl acetamide precursors 3a–c have been synthesized via base-assisted nucleophilic acylation of the appropriate
fluorinated anilines with chloroacetyl chloride using triethylamine
as a basic catalyst and dichloromethane as a solvent.

The structures
of the resulted imidazolium iodides 4a–f were
elucidated based on their spectroscopic data. Their 1H
NMR spectra showed clearly the appearance of two distinct singlets
at 4.64–5.29 and 10.39–10.77 ppm assigned to the NCH2 and NHCO protons,
which confirmed the success of the quaternization reaction. All the
remaining protons were recorded in their respective area (see Experimental Section). In addition, the 13C NMR spectra were in agreement with the designed structures. They
exhibited new signals at 163.75–164.99 and 50.54–51.56
ppm belonging to the acetamide carbonyl (NHCO) and methylene
(NCH2) carbons, respectively.

The resulting
imidazolium iodides 4a–f underwent
a metathetical anion exchange via their treatment
with appropriate fluorinated metal salts in acetonitrile furnishing
on the elaboration of the desired task-specific imidazolium ionic
liquids incorporating specific fluorinated anions (BF4–, PF6–, and CF3COO–) as counteranions 5a–r (Scheme 1).

The structures of the obtained ILs 5a–r were
deduced from their spectroscopic data. It is noticeable that no changes
were recorded on the signals that appeared in their 1H
and 13C NMR spectra. This confirmed that the exchange occurred
only on the counteranion. Thus, the presence of PF6– anion was evidenced by the 31P and 19F NMR spectra. The presence of a characteristic septet between
−157.43 and −131.04 ppm in 31P spectra, as
well as a diagnostic doublet ranging from −69.18 to −69.16
ppm in their 19F NMR spectra, supported the success of
the PF6– anion exchange
(Table 2).

Table 2 Physical
and Analytical Data of the Imidazolium ILs
Carrying Fluorinated Counteranions 5a–r
On
the other hand, the incorporation of tetrafluroborate (BF4–) anions on the specific imidazolium ionic liquids
was evidenced based on their 31B and 19F NMR
spectral data. Their 31B NMR data showed a diagnostic multiplet
near −1.32 to −1.29 ppm, but their 19F NMR
spectra exhibited two characteristic doublets around −148.23
to −148.14 ppm. However, the structures of the imidazolium
ionic liquids, bearing the trifluoroacetate (CF3COO–) as a counter anion, were deduced based on their 19F NMR spectra and showed a distinct singlet around −73.67
to −73.52 ppm attributed to such an anion. Additionally, all
the spectra showed variable multiplets ranging from −141.60
to −118.31 ppm belonging to the aromatic fluorine atoms of
the substituted phenyl rings (see Experimental Section).

2.2 DNA Binding
Study
DNA is among the most significant pharmaceutical targets
of anticancer medications.28−30 Thus, studying the interactions of target compounds with DNA is
important to get an indication about their anticancer impacts and
imaginable mechanisms of action. In general, a compound and DNA formed
covalent and noncovalent bonds. Through covalent bonding, a labile
compound is switched by a nitrogen atom of the DNA base, such as N7 of guanine, in which the interactions like
electrostatic, intercalation, and groove binding are conceivable in
non-covalent binding.31 Meanwhile, The
change in the wavelength or absorption or both is characteristic of
the interactions and intercalative modes including strong stacking
interactions between DNA base pairs and aromatic chromophores.32 It is supposed that bathochromism means breakage
of the secondary structure of DNA and hyperchromism involves covalent
binding. Moreover, considerable red shifts revealed that the compounds
were coordinated to DNA via N7 position
of guanine.33 On the other hand, no or
slight shifts in UV spectra are indicative of an outside groove binding,
generally with minor hyperchromicity.34

In this study, the absorption bands of the tested ionic liquids 4a–f and 5a–r are recorded in the
absence and presence of DNA. The spectra for 4a are shown
in Figure 1 as the
representative one. The UV–vis spectral data for ILs 4a–f and 5a–r are summarized in Table 3. The DNA spectra
for the remaining compounds are provided in the Supporting Information. Obviously, the absorption spectra
of the compounds revealed the presence of absorption bands around
200 nm. The trivial shifts of the bands were assigned to 240–320
nm by adding DNA owing to the intraligand π → π*
and n → π* transitions.35,36 These minor
shifts of the bands pointed to bathochromic shifts of all the compounds,
which confirmed their interactions with DNA. Additionally, hypochromaticities
were recorded for all the compounds with the addition of DNA in different
concentrations (1.45 × 10–4 to 1.0 × 10–5 M). Such changes are obvious evidence of the formation
of DNA adducts.37 It is believed that these
hypochromic shifts are probably due to the covalent and noncovalent
bonds, which were observed in all target compounds.38

compound 4a.

Furthermore, the values of DNA binding constants
for all ILs range from 4.543 × 104 to 3.518 ×
105, signifying a good interaction with DNA. The regression
analysis was investigated by origin software for DNA binding readings.
The resulted correlation coefficient (R2) for each compound is also given in the respective figure and showed
that almost all compounds interpolated through the minor groove with
Ct-DNA. These results are bolstered by the accessible literature.39 The literature referred that the compounds forming
adducts with DNA through minor grooves and hydrophobic interactions
as well as hydrogen bonds make major contribution adducts.40,41 All
these facts are well supported by the simulation studies.

2.3 Anticancer Study
In vitro percentage inhibitions of
lung cancer cell line H-1229
were used to assess the anticancer profiles of the tested ILs at 5.0,
10.0, 15.0, and 20.0 mM concentrations. The results are represented
in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Anticancer profiles of
the reported molecules with H-1229
cell line.

Initially, the tested molecules 4a–f, 5a–5f, 5-g–5l, and/or 5m–5r were
dissolved in DMSO (0.1%), and natural cell by DMSO was used as vehicle
control. The resulting mixtures were accumulated until the control
cells touched an inactive phase. After 24 h, the cells were counted.
The proliferation inhibitions were clearly enhanced with the increasing
amount of compounds. The results exhibited a noteworthy inhibition
in cancer cell proliferation. The maximum percentage of inhibitions
were in the range of 48–59%. The inhibition ranges of 4a–f, 5a–5f, 5-g–5l, and 5m–5r compounds were 50–59, 48–56,
50–55, and 52–56%, respectively. The percentage inhibitions
were almost the same in all four series. The variations in the percentage
inhibition were observed with the dissociation tendencies of the reported
compounds. It was observed that highly dissociated molecules exhibited
higher anticancer activities. This is probably because highly dissociate
molecules provided a high concentration of positive ionic liquid parts
to the DNA, leading to the higher binding with DNA and hence more
activity. In the same manner, it was observed that bulky molecules
showed low anticancer activities due to the steric effect. Thus, large-size
molecules might have restricted their interactions with DNA. Overall,
the total percentage inhibitions of 48–59% are quite good,
and the reported molecules may be considered as potential anticancer
agents for lung cancer.

2.4 Docking Study
It is important to mention here that
out of 24 compounds, the basic organic moieties are 6 in 4a–f. It is very clear that DNA docking study is carried out with organic
moieties. Therefore, the docking study was carried out with six moieties
of 4a–f molecules. The obtained binding energies
of the reported imidazolium ILs with DNA are summarized in Table 4 and were in the range
from −3.9 to −4.4 kcal/mol. It is noticeable that the
binding energies were variable due to the structure variation of the
tested imidazolium compounds. Also, these structural differences also
caused variation in hydrogen bond formation with DNA. Hydrogen bondings
were found responsible for six
moieties with DNA binding one hydrogen bond was formed between DNA
and compounds 4a, 4d, and 4e, while two hydrogen bonds were formed between DNA and compound 4b. However, three hydrogen bonds were formed between DNA
and compound 4c. The hydrophobic interactions were also
responsible for DNA interaction with the reported compounds. All the
hydrophobic interactions with DNA are shown in Table 4. It was found that the DNA fragments involved
with imidazolium were dc9, dc13, dc15, dg10, dg14, dc15, and dt8.
The representative model of DNA binding with compound 4a is shown in Figure 3, while the rest are given in the Supporting Information. On the contrary, the docked results clearly showed
that all tested compounds reacted with DNA minor grooves. The docking
model in Figure 3 clearly
indicates DNA binding via DNA minor grooves. The
DNA interaction process revealed that the orientation of all compounds
was the same and such that their active sites were inside minor grooves.
The DNA binding results were in agreement with the docking results.

3 Conclusions
Ionic liquids are gaining importance
as anticancer molecules. Therefore,
novel imidazolium ionic liquid halides tethering different fluorinated
phenylacetamide side chains were prepared by quaternization of 1-methyl
and/or 1,2-dimethylimidazole with appropriate 2-chloro-N-(fluorinatedphenyl)acetamides. These were converted to their ionic
liquid analogues having fluorinated counteranions (PF6–, BF4–, and/or CF3COO–). All newly synthesized ILs were characterized
by various spectroscopic methods. The synthesized compounds were studied
for DNA binding and anticancer activities with H-1229 cell line. Besides,
the modeling studies were also carried out to investigate the DNA
interaction mechanism of these molecules. The results of DNA binding,
modeling, and anticancer activities indicated good interactions of
these classes of compounds with DNA. Finally, it was concluded that
these ionic liquids may be used as excellent anticancer candidates
for treating human cancer.

Melting points were measured with a
Stuart Scientific SMP1 apparatus and were uncorrected. All synthesized
compounds were fully characterized by 1H, 13C, 19F, 31P, and 11B NMR spectroscopy

Procedure for the Synthesis of Imidazolium
IL Halides 4a–f
2-Chloro-N-(4-fluorophenyl)acetamide, 2-chloro-N-(4-fluorophenyl)acetamide,
and/or 2-chloro-N-(2,4,5-trifluorophenyl)acetamide 3a–c (10 mmol) were added with stirring to a solution
of 1-methyl and/or 1,2-dimethyl imidazole 1a,b (10 mmol) in acetonitrile (30 mL). Then, the mixture was refluxed
for 2 h, until the completion of the reaction, as indicated by TLC
(silicagel, hexane-ethyl acetate). The excess of the solvent was removed
under reduced pressure. The obtained product was filtered and/or extracted
by chloroform to yield the desired ionic liquids 4a–f.

NB: Sodium iodide (10 mmol) was added during the synthesis

hexafluorophosphate, sodium tetrafluoroborate, and/or sodium trifluoroacetate
(1.1 mmol) at room temperature under stirring. The reaction mixture
was heated under reflux for 24 h. Then, the reaction mixture was cooled
and filtered to eliminate solid metal halide. The acetonitrile was
evaporated to afford quantitatively the desired imidazolium ionic
liquids 5a–r.

The characterization of the

4.5 DNA Binding
Studies
The DNA binding
experiments were carried out in Tris buffer (10–2 M, pH 7.2). Initially, the concentration of DNA was adjusted by
recording the absorption spectrum of the CT-DNA solution. This solution
showed UV absorbance at 230/260 nm (=1.8), indicating the free nature
of DNA, with ε value equal to 6600 M–1 cm–1.44 The different solutions
of the tested compounds and DNA were prepared and kept at 4 °C.
First, the compounds were dissolved in DMSO (0.1%) and then diluted
with Tris buffer till their concentrations became 2.4 × 10–4 M. Then, DNA was added in various concentrations
(1.2–1.5 × 10–5 M) to record the respected
absorption. Eventually, the binding constants (Kb) were calculated according to the Benessi–Hilderbrand eq 1.45 1  where
absorption coefficients εa, εf,
and εb are related
to Aobs/[compound], extinction coefficient
for the compounds in free as well in fully bound form. The binding
constants (Kb) for different compounds
were determined from slopes and the intercepts of the plots of  

4.6 Anticancer
Studies
The antiproliferative
activity of the target imidazolium ILs was performed against lung
cancer cell line H-1229 using the MTT assay. Thus, the cells were
seeded (density of 8000 cells/well) in a 96-well plate and incubated.
Around 60–70% confluency, the treatment of the cells with different
concentrations of the reported compounds (5.0, 10.0, 15, and 20.0
mM) was carried out, followed by incubation for 24 h. The cells were
assayed by adding 15.0 μL of 5.0 mg/mL MTT. Then, the respective
media from each well were aspirated at 37 °C of incubation for
4 h. In 100 μL of DMSO, the cells were resuspended and the plate
was instantly covered with aluminum foil and shook gently for 15 min.
Absorbance was measured at 540 nm46 and
the percent inhibition of cellular proliferation was calculated using eq 2. 2  

4.7 Docking Study
The docking readings were
conducted using Windows XP operating
system on Intel dual CPU (1.86 GHz). Marwin sketch was used in the
drawing of the ligand 3D structure, which was transformed to the PDB
file format. Ligand preparation was achieved by using AutoDock Tool
(ADT) 4.0 version to allocate Gastegier charges, nonpolar hydrogens
were merged, and then saved in PDBQT file format.47 X-ray DNA crystal structure (PDB ID: 1bna) was retrieved from
the Protein Data Bank (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb). The receptors
were saved in the PDB file format using AutoDock Tools (ADT) 4.0,
leaving heteroatoms (water). Besides, Gastegier charges were allocated
to the receptor and then saved employing previous tools in the PDBQT
file format. Preparation of parameter files for grid and docking was
performed by means of ADT. Docking was carried out with AutoDock 4.0
(Scripps Research Institute) considering conformationally all the
rotatable bonds of the ligand as rotatable and receptor as rigid.41 Grid box size of 60 × 80 × 114 Å3 with 0.375 Å spacing was used that encompassed the whole
DNA. Macromolecule docking was done using an empirical-free energy
function and Lamarckian genetic algorithm (LGA), with an initial population
of 150 randomly placed individuals, a maximum number of 2 500 000
energy assessments, a crossover rate of 0.80, and a mutation rate
of 0.02. For each ligand and serum–ligand adduct, at least
50 independent docking runs were performed for the lowest free energy
of binding confirmation from the largest cluster and then saved in
PDBQT format.
