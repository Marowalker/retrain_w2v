Introduction
2,3,4-Trisubstituted
pyridines are frequently found in biologically
active molecules. For instance, the compound 1(1) that has a reactivating ability of nerve-agent-inhibited
human acetylcholinesterase, anti-inflammatory agent 2,2 antifungal agent UK-2A 3,3,4 and anti-influenza agent 4(5) contain 2,3,4-trisubstituted pyridines (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Biologically active compounds 1–4 containing 2,3,4-trisubstituted pyridines
(emphasized in red color).

3-Hydroxy-4-substituted picolinonitrile 5 (Scheme 1) is a valuable synthetic
intermediate for 2,3,4-trisubstituted pyridines because the cyano
group provides opportunities to construct a variety of functional
groups, including amino, methyl,6 amido,7 imidate,8 amidoxime,9 keto,10 carboxyl,11 and ester1 groups,
in only one step. In addition, the 3-hydroxy group provides opportunities
to introduce various acyl1 and alkyl12 groups in one step. However, the reported synthetic
approach for 5 is surprisingly limited. The only reported
procedure for the synthesis of 5 includes carbamate formation
from 3-hydroxy-picolinonitrile 6,13−17ortho-lithiation of 7, and subsequent electrophilic trapping of the iodine or formyl group
(Scheme 1, lower route).1 Unfortunately, this reported procedure (yields
in reaction 7 to 5: 48–53%) requires
strong anionic conditions.

Scheme 1 Synthetic Approaches to 3-Hydroxy-4-Substituted
Picolinonitrile 5 That Is a Valuable Intermediate for
2,3,4-Trisubstituted
Pyridines
We have reported the
functionalization of isoxazole via 4-isoxazolyl
magnesium species.18 This protocol enabled
us to synthesize 4-propargylaminoisoxazole 8, which underwent
intramolecular SEAr reaction catalyzed by Au(I) to afford
isoxazolopyridines 9.19 Here,
we report a unique synthetic approach to 3-hydroxy-4-substituted picolinonitriles 5 via isoxazolopyridine formation/N–O bond cleavage
sequence. This sequence can be carried out in a one-pot fashion under
ambient reaction conditions.

Results and Discussion
It is known
that 3- and/or 5-unsubstituted isoxazoles readily occur
by N–O bond cleavage under mild basic conditions.20,21 De Munno and co-workers reported the mechanism of hydroxide-ion-mediated
ring opening of 3-unsubstituted isoxazoles.22 Houk and co-workers elucidated the mechanism of formate-mediated
ring opening of 3-unsubstituted isoxazoles on the basis of theoretical
calculations.23 Both reports supported
concerted deprotonation at the 3-position and N–O bond cleavage.
On the other hand, acidic cleavage has been much less investigated,
and there are only three reports that describe HCl-mediated N–O
bond cleavage of 3-unsubstituted isoxazoles.24−26 Although a
detailed mechanistic study has not been reported, an acid might activate
the oxygen atom of isoxazole ring, and then, a counteranion and/or
solvent molecule might abstract a proton at the 3-position.23 We thought that 3-hydroxy-4-substituted picolinonitriles 5 can be readily synthesized from isoxazolopyridines 9 if N–O bond cleavage of 9 takes place.
However, there is no report of N–O bond cleavage of 3-unsubstituted
isoxazolopyridines. Therefore, the N–O bond cleavage of previously
synthesized isoxazolopyridine 9a(19) was first examined under various acidic and basic conditions (Table 1). Among Bro̷nsted
acid mediated conditions (entries 1–4), aqueous HCl in MeOH
conditions (entry 1) afforded 5a in 70% yield with complete
conversion of 9a. The use of weaker acid, KH2PO4, resulted in insufficient conversion (entry 2). CH3CO2H- or CF3CO2H-mediated
conditions improved the conversion but decreased yields (entries 3
and 4). The reaction did not proceed under Lewis acid mediated conditions,
such as BF3·OEt2 (entry 5). Basic conditions
tend to afford better results than the acidic conditions (entries
6–11). The use of organic-base-mediated conditions, such as
Et3N and N,N-dimethyl-4-aminopyridine
(DMAP), afforded 5a in high yields (entries 6 and 7),
whereas sterically bulky 2,6-di-t-butyl-4-methylpyridine
(DTBMP) resulted in insufficient conversion (entry 8). In the case
of 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO), the reaction proceeded in
both methanol and methanol–water media; however, the yields
were low (entries 9 and 10). In contrast, the use of inorganic bases
afforded good results (entries 11–13). In particular, K2CO3 in MeOH conditions (entry 13) gave the desired
product 5a in 30 min in 92% yield. Only a trace amount
of 5a was produced in MeOH without any bases or acids,
even for a long reaction time (23 h, entry 14).

(1:1).

Because the use of
K2CO3 in MeOH accelerated
the reaction and produced the desired product in high yield at the
shortest reaction time (Table 1, entry 13), the substrate scope of the N–O bond cleavage
of isoxazolopyridines was examined under this optimized condition.
The results are summarized in Table 2. The 4-alkyl-substituted 3-hydroxypicolinonitriles 9b–d were obtained in high yields. In
particular, 9d containing a sterically bulky tert-butyl group was obtained in the highest yield (95%).
The 4-aryl-substituted 3-hydroxypicolinonitriles 9e–g containing an electron-donating substituent on the aryl
ring were also obtained in high yields (entries 4–6), whereas 9h containing an electron-withdrawing substituent on the aryl
ring was obtained in moderate yield (entry 7). Trimethylsilyl (TMS)-substituted
3-hydroxypicolinonitrile 9i was also obtained, although
the observed yield was moderate (entry 8).

The
N–O bond cleavage of isoxazolopyridines 10a,10b with different substitution patterns was examined
(Scheme 2). Both desired
products 11a,11b were obtained in good to
excellent yields. We already reported the synthesis of 9 and 10 from 4-propargylaminoisoxazole 8 as mentioned before;19 therefore, we
established a unique synthetic approach for various 4-substituted
3-hydroxypicolinonitriles 5 and 11 from
the corresponding 4-propargylaminoisoxazoles 8 in two
steps. Needless to say, 3,4,5-substituted isoxazolopyridine, such
as 3-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-phenylisoxazolo[4,5-b]pyridine,
did not undergo the K2CO3-mediated N–O
bond cleavage, revealing that the deprotonation at C-3 hydrogen is
essential to initiate the N–O cleavage in the 3-hydroxypicolinonitrile
formation.

Scheme 2 K2CO3-Mediated N–O Bond
Cleavage of
Isoxazolopyridines 10
If isoxazolopyridine formation and N–O bond cleavage
steps
can be carried out in a one-pot fashion, synthetic efficiency is further
increased. Therefore, one-pot synthesis of 4-substituted 3-hydroxypicolinonitriles 5 from the corresponding 4-propargylaminoisoxazoles 8 was examined using selected substrates (Table 3). The one-pot two-step yield
was compared with the stepwise yields calculated from the two isolated
yields of 9 and 5. Various 4-substituted
3-hydroxypicolinonitriles 5 were obtained in a one-pot
fashion (entries 1–6). The observed one-pot yields were slightly
decreased compared with the stepwise yields (entries 1–4 and
6), whereas an obvious improvement of yield was observed in the case
of 4-F3CC6H4-substituted 3-hydroxypicolinonitrile
synthesis (entry 5). The intermediate 9h is labile, and
its isolation by silica gel chromatography decreased the yield of 5h. The isoxazolopyridine bearing a heteroaromatic substituent
at the R group (5j) was also obtained from the corresponding
4-propargylaminoisoxazole 8j in 48% yield (entry 7).

Conclusions
In conclusion, one-pot isoxazolopyridine formation/N–O bond
cleavage sequence for the synthesis of trisubstituted pyridine 5 was demonstrated. This unique synthetic approach can be
carried out under ambient conditions and does not require strong basic
conditions. Our developed sequence should be useful as a complementary
approach to the conventional one and accelerate the development of
drug candidates based on trisubstituted pyridines that can be readily
derived from 4-substituted 3-hydroxypicolinonitriles 5.

To a solution of isoxazolopyridine 9 or 10 (0.100 mmol) in dry MeOH (5.00 mL/mmol
of 9 or 10), K2CO3 (0.150 mmol) was added. The mixture was stirred at 60 °C for
30 min. The reaction was quenched by addition of 1 M aq HCl. The resultant
mixture was extracted with AcOEt, and the combined organic layers
were dried over MgSO4 and filtered. The solvent was removed
in vacuo to give 4-substituted 3-hydroxypicolinonitriles 5 or 11.
