We report advanced
liquid-crystalline (LC) electrolytes for use
in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). We evaluated the potential of LC
electrolytes with a half cell composed of Li metal and LiFePO4 which is a conventional positive electrode for LIBs. Low-molecular-weight
carbonates of ethylene carbonate or propylene carbonate were incorporated
into the two-dimensional (2D) nanostructured electrolyte composed
of mesogen-containing carbonate and lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide.
The incorporation of low-molecular-weight carbonates increased the
ionic conductivity with maintaining 2D nanostructures in the LC state.
High-power performances at relatively high current densities induced
by higher ionic conductivities have been achieved by LC electrolytes
with low-molecular-weight carbonates. Furthermore, room-temperature
operation of LIBs using LC electrolytes is reported for the first
time. In the research field of electrolytes for LIBs, we demonstrate
the progress of a new category of LC electrolytes.

Introduction
Intensive studies have
focused on ion-transport solid and quasisolid
organic materials1−5 for the development of actuators,6 transistors,7 electrochromic devices,8,9 water-treatment
membranes,10−13 and in particular, energy devices such as batteries14−16 and capacitors15,17,18 because solid organic materials have light-weight properties, easy
processability, and film-forming abilities. These properties are advantageous
for versatile and large-scale applications, especially for portable
and flexible electronics. Gel polymers,19−21 solid polymers,22−25 ionic plastic crystals,26−28 and nanostructured liquid crystals29−32 have been developed as organic ion transporters for applications
as electrolytes. Recently, ion-conductive liquid crystals29−40 and ionic solids preserving liquid-crystalline (LC) structures41−45 have attracted attention as quasisolid and solid-state electrolytes
because they provide 1D,33,34 2D,35−37 and 3D38−40 nanochannels. These materials are expected to act as efficient and
selective ion transporters. There are two types of LC electrolytes.
One type is polar liquid crystals complexed with ionic species. For
example, poly- and oligo-oxyethylene35 and
carbonates33,36 have been used to form the complexes.
The other type is ionic liquid crystals, which contain imidazolium,34,37 ammonium,38 phosphonium,38 and sulfonate ions.39,40 These materials also
show miscible properties with ionic salts.

Energy-generating
and energy-storage devices have been developed
based on the accumulated results of the basic research on LC ion conductors.33−45 For energy-generating devices, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs)
using LC electrolytes have been fabricated.46−51 We successfully applied carbonate-based liquid crystals complexed
with ionic liquids and iodides for DSSCs. Thermally stable DSSCs were
obtained by using 2D nanostructured LC complexes as electrolytes transporting
I–/I3– species. These
solar cells can be operated at remarkably high temperatures up to
120 °C owing to the nonvolatile and thermally stable properties
of the LC electrolytes.46−51 Improvement of the durability under high temperature conditions
is an important problem to be solved in the research of DSSCs. The
possibility for the use in DSSCs was demonstrated by exploiting the
characteristics of LC electrolytes.

Our strategy is to construct
LIBs based on LC electrolytes in the
field of energy storage. LIBs are suitable for electric vehicles and
plug-in electric vehicles because of the high energy densities. Intensive
research has focused on the high-power performance and high energy
density of LIBs.52−55

Among the research and development issues for LIBs, the electrolyte
is an important factor in addition to the active materials of the
cathode and anode because there are strong correlations between the
electrolyte and the properties of power, charge–discharge cycles,
and safety. Organic electrolytic solutions, which are practically
used in the current LIBs, have a safety problem owing to their high
volatility, flammability, and potential for leakage.56−58 Safer electrolytes are urgently required. Solid-state and quasisolid-state
alternatives have attracted growing interest in place of liquid electrolytes.59−64

For the first time, we reported smectic LC electrolytes for
LIBs.64 As electrolytes for LIBs, materials
with a high
resistivity against degradation caused by the high oxidation and low
reduction potentials are important. This was an essential problem
to be solved for liquid crystals for the application to LIBs. We designed
and prepared rod-shaped molecule 1 having a mesogenic
moiety and a cyclic carbonate moiety at the terminal of the alkyl
chain spacer.64 The mixtures of 1 and Li salts were operated as an LC electrolyte for LIBs at 60 °C.
Reversible charge–discharge was observed for the LIBs composed
of the LC electrolytes.64 In spite of the
high expectation of LC electrolytes, high-rate performance LIBs based
on LC electrolytes have not yet been achieved owing to the problems
of ionic conductivities. Higher ionic conductivities of LC electrolytes
were required for the development of high-power LIBs with room-temperature
operation. We previously reported an enhancement of ionic conductivity
by a noncovalent approach.65,66 The use of noncovalent
interactions such as hydrogen bonding and ion–dipole/dipole–dipole
interactions enables supramolecular organization of mobile molecules
into LC nanostructures.39,44,45,65,66 For example, mesogenic molecules having hydroxy groups mixed with
ionic liquids form layered65 and cylindrical66 nanochannels of ionic liquids as conducting
LC self-assemblies through hydrogen bonding interactions between hydroxy
groups and ionic liquids. For the construction of efficient Li-ion
conductors, Gin et al. reported the polymerized lyotropic LC systems
with 3D interconnected nanopores filled with Li-salt-doped organic
carbonate liquid electrolytes.44,45 1D and 3D Li-ion conductors
composed of zwitterionic liquid crystals, an Li salt, and a carbonate
electrolyte were developed in our previous work.39 In these systems, carbonate electrolytes play important
roles both in enhancement of ionic conductivity by improving dissociation
of Li salts and mobility of ions and in formation of nanosegregated
LC structures through ion–dipole interactions between Li-ions
and carbonate molecules. Thus, incorporation of mobile small electrolyte
molecules into the LC ion-conductive nanostructures can be a promising
strategy to obtain highly conductive materials for LIBs.

In
the present study, to achieve high performance for LIBs with
LC electrolytes, we have applied ternary mixtures of compound 1, lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI), and
ethylene carbonate (EC) or propylene carbonate (PC) (Figure 1). We expected that EC or PC
molecules would be incorporated into the self-organized structure
with structure-directing molecule 1 through weak noncovalent
interactions. The ternary mixtures are expected to form highly Li-ion-conductive
2D pathways, resulting in the construction of high-performance LIBs
(Figure 2). We discuss
the potential of the LC electrolytes on the basis of electrochemical
performance of half cells composed of Li metal and LiFePO4 which is a conventional positive electrode material for LIBs.

enhance the ion conductivities for Li-ion transport in the nanostructured
LC electrolyte for the lithium-ion battery (LIB).

Results and Discussion
LC Properties
Ternary mixtures of
compound 1, EC or PC, and LiTFSI were prepared. The molar
ratio of LiTFSI was
maintained at 10 mol % for the mixtures. We previously observed that
the ionic conductivities at 10 mol % of LiTFSI became a maximum for
the binary mixtures of 1 and LiTFSI.64

Table 1 presents the phase transition behavior of the ternary mixtures as
a function of the weight ratio of EC in the mixture of 1, EC, and LiTFSI. These components were miscible, and their mixtures
showed stable smectic A (SmA) phases (Supporting Information, Figures S1 and S2) in a wide range of temperatures.
The isotropization temperatures of the mixtures decreased as the weight
ratio of EC increased. For example, the SmA isotropic transition was
observed at 114 °C for the binary mixtures of 1 and
LiTFSI, whereas the isotropization temperature was observed at 80
°C for the ternary mixtures of 1, LiTFSI, and EC
of 29 wt % [1/EC(29)]. This behavior can be explained
by the destabilization of layered structures by the introduction of
smaller molecules as is observed in other LC systems.39 The wide-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern for 1/EC(29) at 60 °C showed three reflection peaks at 49.1,
25.6, and 16.3 Å corresponding to the (001), (002), and (003)
reflections, respectively, of a layered structure with a spacing of
approximately 50 Å (Figure S3). The
layer spacing was nearly twice the molecular length of 1, which was estimated to be 22 Å by molecular mechanics calculations.
This observation indicated the formation of a bilayer structure in
the SmA phase. The interlayer spacings of the smectic structures were
examined for the mixtures of different weight ratios of EC at 60 °C
(Figure S4). The spacings increased as
the weight ratio of EC increased. These results suggest that the EC
molecules were organized into the bilayer structures as shown in Figure 2. The ternary mixture
of 1, LiTFSI, and PC of 32 wt % (1/PC(32)),
in which the molar content of PC was the same as that of EC in 1/EC(29), also showed the SmA phase, and its isotropization
temperature was 27 °C lower than that of 1/EC(29).

calorimetry at the rate of 10 °C min–1 on cooling.

Ionic Conductivities
Ionic conductivities of the mixtures
were measured by the alternating current impedance method using the
cells with comb-shaped gold electrodes on a glass substrate. Figure 3 shows the ionic
conductivities of the LC mixtures. All the ionic conductivities were
measured on the heating processes preceded by the isotropization of
the samples and the cooling to room temperature. All the samples were
homeotropically aligned in the smectic phases on the glass substrates.
At the smectic–isotropic phase transitions, an abrupt decrease
in the conductivities was observed. These trends suggested that the
2D ionic pathways in the smectic structures were disrupted because
of the phase transition to the isotropic phase. The higher EC content
led to the higher ionic conductivities. The conductivities of the
ternary mixtures of 1/EC(29), 1/EC(16),
and 1/EC(8) at 60 °C were 5.5 × 10–4, 1.7 × 10–4, and 5.7 × 10–5 S cm–1, respectively. Compared with the conductivities
of the binary mixture of 1 and LiTFSI, the ternary mixtures
showed higher conductivities. The conductivities of 1/EC(29) at 60 and 25 °C were approximately 20 times and 60 times
higher than those of the binary mixture, respectively. For the ternary
mixture, highly mobile EC molecules efficiently transported Li-ions
within the conducting layers of the smectic structures. The conductivities
of 1/PC(32) were almost the same as those of 1/EC(29) in spite of the difference of isotropization temperatures.

and LiTFSI on heating.

High-Power Performance for LIBs
The electrochemical
stability of the LC electrolyte of 1/EC(29) was evaluated
by the cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements of a coin-type cell constructed
by a working electrode of stainless steel and a counter electrode
of Li metal. A cyclic voltammogram in the potential range of −0.04
to 3.9 V versus Li/Li+ at 60 °C at a scan rate of
0.025 mV s–1 showed peaks of lithium deposition
and dissolution at approximately 0 V versus Li/Li+. No
significant peaks by decomposition in the potential range up to 3.9
V versus Li/Li+ were observed. These results suggest that
these LC electrolytes can be applied to LIBs with a wide potential
range.

The rate capabilities of the LC electrolytes prepared
in the present study were evaluated by charging and discharging the
LiFePO4 positive electrode for successive 5 × 5 cycles
at current rates of 5, 25, 100, and 500 mA g–1 and
then back to 5 mA g–1 at 60 °C (Figure 4). It is noteworthy that the
initial (1st cycle) and final (25th cycle) capacities of approximately
150 mA g–1 at a low current density of 5 mA g–1 were near to the theoretical capacity of LiFePO4 (172 mA h g–1). In addition, in the case
of 1/EC(29), for example, initial and final capacities
were almost the same values of 151 and 149 mA h g–1, that is, 98.7% of capacity was retained, while ca. one month passed
during the start and the end of the measurements. These results suggest
that the LC electrolytes have sufficient long-term stability, and
no significant side reactions stemmed from the electrolyte components
occur during the operation in LIBs. These results indicate that the
LC electrolytes can function as an electrolyte of LIBs. Notably, in
the case of 1/EC(29), the capacity of 154 mA h g–1 was retained at a current density of 25 mA g–1. Moreover, the capacity was still retained at high
values of 142 and 117 mA g–1 even at relatively
high current densities of 100 and 500 mA g–1, respectively.
This excellent rate performance for the LC electrolytes arose from
the high ionic conductivity as shown in Figure 3. These results suggest that the novel LC
electrolytes formed through the noncovalent approach achieved an improvement
of the high-power performances of LIBs using the LC electrolyte.

Figure 4 Rate performances
of the cells composed of Li/LC electrolyte/LiFePO4 with
the electrolytes of 1/EC(29), 1/EC(16),
and 1/EC(8) in the potential range of 2.7–3.8
V vs Li/Li+ for successive 5 × 5 cycles at rates of
5, 25, 100, and 500 mA g–1, and then back to 5 mA
g–1 at 60 °C.

The electrolyte of 1/EC(16) retained a capacity
of
140 mA h g–1 at a current density of 25 mA g–1. However, the capacity decreased to 96 and 16 mA
h g–1 at relatively high current densities of 100
and 500 mA g–1, respectively. In the electrolyte
of 1/EC(8), the capacity was 28 mA h g–1 even at a relatively low current density of 25 mA g–1. The capacity was not observed at high current densities of 100
and 500 mA g–1. These properties resulted from the
ratio of EC in the mixture that significantly affects the ionic conductivities,
as shown in Figure 3.

The charge/discharge profiles at different current densities
are
presented in Figure 5. The potential plateaus of the charge/discharge profiles by 1/EC(29) show a small polarization at a current density of
up to 100 mA g–1, suggesting low resistance of the
LC electrolyte. The polarization of the potential plateau was still
small even at a high current density of 500 mA g–1. These results suggest that the Li-ion diffusion rate in the LC
electrolyte of 1/EC(29) was sufficient for the charge–discharge
reaction up to the current rate of 500 mA g–1. In
the electrolyte of 1/EC(16), the potential plateaus of
the charge/discharge profiles showed a plateau even at a current density
of 100 mA g–1. The extent of polarization was similar
to that of 1/EC(29) at a high current density of 500
mA g–1. The plateaus and capacity were almost not
observed at a current density of 500 mA g–1. The
plateaus were only observed at a low current density of 5 mA g–1 in the electrolyte of 1/EC(8). These
differences of polarization and capacity were caused by the resistance
components. For the resistance components of LIBs, the different values
of ionic conductivities of the LC electrolytes caused the differences
in the resistance of these cells. The rate capabilities, capacities,
and polarization of potential plateaus were related to the ionic conductivity
of each electrolyte. The electrolyte of 1/EC(29), exhibiting
the highest ionic conductive properties, showed the smallest polarization
and the most stable plateau, which resulted in the highest power performance
of LIBs.

electrolyte/LiFePO4 with the electrolytes of (a) 1/EC(29), (b) 1/EC(16), and (c) 1/EC(8) in the potential range of 2.7–3.8 V vs Li/Li+ for successive 5 × 5 cycles at rates of 5, 25, 100, and 500
mA g–1 at 60 °C. The curves correspond to the
2nd cycles at each rate (2nd, 7th, 12th, and 17th cycles in Figure 4).

Room-Temperature Operation of LIBs
Because the operation
of LIBs at room temperature is important for the development of electrolytes,
we have examined the performance of LIBs with the ternary mixtures
of the LC electrolytes, 1/EC(29) and 1/PC(32).

Figure 6 shows the
charge–discharge profiles and the rate capabilities of the
LiFePO4 positive electrode for various current rates at
25 °C. 1/EC(29) and 1/PC(32) show capacities
of 138 and 136 mA h g–1 at a low current density
of 5 mA g–1, respectively. 1/EC(29)
with a high ionic conductivity retains high values of 126 and 100
mA h g–1 at 25 and 100 mA g–1,
respectively. The high-rate performance of 1/PC(32) was
similar to that of 1/EC(29). The charge–discharge
curves of 1/EC(29) and 1/PC(32) in Figure 7 showed a similar
behavior, where the flat plateaus with small polarization appeared
at moderate current rates of 5 and 25 mA g–1. It
should be noted that the noncovalent approach to the formation of
the LC electrolytes for LIBs is effective for the enhancement of the
LIB performance, leading to the achievement of room-temperature operation.

successive 5 × 5 cycles at rates of 5, 25, 100,
and 500 mA g–1, and then back to 5 mA g–1 at 25 °C.

5, 25, 100, and 500 mA g–1 at 25 °C. The curves
correspond to the 2nd cycles at each rate (2nd, 7th, 12th, and 17th
cycles in Figure 6).

We compared the rate capabilities
between our LC electrolyte of 1/EC(29) in the current
study with polymer electrolytes67−70 to emphasize the excellent performance of the LIBs
with the LC electrolytes
prepared through the noncovalent approach (Figure 8). Figure 8 shows the relationships between the capacity of an
LiFePO4 electrode and the current density of the present
LC electrolyte of 1/EC(29), other polymer electrolytes
of BAB triblock copolymers,67 block copoly(ionic
liquid)s,68 composite of PEO-LiClO4 with ZrO2,69 and polysiloxane-based
polymers70 at various temperatures. The
capacity of the LC electrolyte of 1/EC(29) at 60 °C
exhibited a rate capability similar to that of the BAB triblock copolymer67 and the polysiloxane-based polymer68 at 60 °C. At a room temperature of 25 °C,
both the LC electrolyte of 1/EC(29) and the polysiloxane-based
polymer68 exhibited a comparable rate capability.
The performance of the block copoly(ionic liquid)s70 at 70 °C was lower than that of the LC electrolyte
of 1/EC(29) even at 25 °C. In the comparison between
the LC electrolyte of 1/EC(29) with the composite polymer
electrolyte of PEO-LiClO4 with ZrO269 at 25 °C, a similar behavior of the rate
capability was shown up to a current density of 25 mA g–1. In the region of a current density over 25 mA g–1, the LC electrolyte of 1/EC(29) showed higher power
and energy density. Therefore, the LC electrolyte of 1/EC(29) exhibited a comparable performance with the polymer electrolytes
at 60 °C and at room temperature. A further improvement of the
design for the LC electrolytes in LIBs through noncovalent approaches
would realize a much higher performance.

Conclusions
LC electrolytes constructed
by mesogen-containing carbonate, LiTFSI,
and low-molecular-weight electrolytes of EC or PC have exhibited high-power
performances at 60 °C. Furthermore, we demonstrate room-temperature
operation of the LIBs by using the LC electrolytes for the first time.
The addition of low-molecular-weight carbonates into the 2D LC structures
enhances the ionic conductivity at various temperature regions, including
room temperature, and improves the rate performance of the LIBs. The
improvement of ionic conductivities, which has been achieved through
the noncovalent approach in an LC system, leads to the high-power
performances and room-temperature operation of the LIBs. These results
of the LC electrolytes propose that they are a new category of energy
materials with high performances and stability.

Experimental Section
General
Procedures
The phase-transition behavior of
the mixtures was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC) (Netzsch DSC204 Phoenix calorimeter) with the cooling/heating
rates of 10 K min–1. Transition temperatures were
recorded at the onset of the transition peaks on first cooling. The
LC properties were examined by a polarizing optical microscope (Olympus
BX53) with a heating stage (Linkam LTS 350). XRD was measured by a
diffractometer (Rigaku RINT-2500) using a Cu Kα line. Molecular
mechanics calculations were conducted on the Wavefunction SPARTAN’10
(v. 1.1.0) program.

Materials
All the chemicals used
for the preparation
of compound 1 were purchased from commercial sources
and used without purification. LiTFSI and EC of a lithium battery
grade were purchased from Kishida Chemical, and PC of an electrochemical
grade was purchased from Kanto Chemical Co., Inc. Compound 1 was synthesized according to the previously reported procedures.18

Preparation of the Ternary Mixtures of 1, EC or
PC, and LiTFSI
Prior to preparing ternary mixtures of the
LC electrolytes, the binary mixtures of compound 1 and
LiTFSI were prepared by dissolving the components in tetrahydrofuran
followed by slow evaporation of the solvent at 80 °C under a
reduced pressure in a vacuum oven. After that, EC or PC was added
to the binary mixtures of 1 and LiTFSI in an argon-filled
glovebox. The containers of these mixtures were tightly sealed and
heated to 120 °C. After the mixtures were homogenized in the
isotropic states, they were cooled to room temperature.

Measurements
of Ionic Conductivities
The ionic conductivities
were measured by the alternating current impedance method using a
chemical impedance meter (HIOKI 3532-80) (frequency range: 100 Hz
to 1 MHz, applied voltage: 0.3 V) with a heating stage (Linkam LTS
350), a temperature controller (Linkam TMS 94), and a hot-stage cooler
(Linkam LNP 9412) with the heating rate of 2 K min–1. Ionic conductivities were calculated to be the product of 1/Rb (Ω–1) times the cell
constants (cm–1) for comb-shaped gold electrodes
with SiO2 microparticle spacers (16 μm), which were
calibrated with the HI7033L 84 μS cm–1 conductivity
standard from Hanna Instruments.

Cyclic Voltammetry
CR2032-type coin cells were assembled
in an argon-filled glovebox using a stainless-steel plate (SUS-316L)
as the working electrode and Li metal as the counter electrode. A
polypropylene film was used as a separator, which was filled with
the LC electrolytes. The electrolytes were spread on the separators
prior to the assembly of the cells. The assembled cells were placed
in a thermostat at 120 °C for 15 min to allow the separators
to soak up the electrolytes. The CV was measured on a BioLogic VMP3
Multichannel potentiostat within the potential range of −0.04
to 3.9 V versus Li/Li+ at a scan rate of 0.025 mV s–1 at 60 °C.

Charge–Discharge
Experiments
The powder of LiFePO4 (SLFP-PT30,
Tatung Fine Chemical) as the active material,
carbon black (Super P-Li, TIMCAL) as an electrically conductive additive,
and poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF#1300, Kureha) as a binder were
mixed in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone with an ultrasonic
homogenizer (UH-50, SMT Co., Ltd.) to obtain the slurry of the electrode
material. The weight ratio of the solid materials was 65:30:5. The
LiFePO4 electrode was prepared by spreading the slurry
onto an Al-foil as a current collector. The slurry was dried at 100
°C in a vacuum oven for 90 min. CR2032-type coin cells were assembled
in an argon-filled glovebox using Li metal as the reference and counter
electrode. A polypropylene film was used as a separator, which was
filled with the LC electrolytes. The electrolytes were spread on the
separators prior to the assembly of the cells. The assembled cells
were placed in a thermostat at 120 °C for 15 min for the separators
to soak up the electrolytes. Galvanostatic charge–discharge
cycling of the LiFePO4 electrode was tested on a Hokuto
Denko galvanostat in the potential range of 2.7 to 3.8 V versus Li/Li+ for 5 cycles at rates of 5, 25, 100, and 500 mA g–1, and then back to 5 mA g–1 at 60 °C. The
specific current and the specific capacity were calculated on the
basis of the weight of the composite.
