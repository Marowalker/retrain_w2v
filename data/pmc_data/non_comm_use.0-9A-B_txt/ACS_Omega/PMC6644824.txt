We performed a computational study
on the interaction of O-containing
compounds coming from biomass with a catalytic surface of MoO3. The addition of H atoms on the metal oxide surface mimics
different scenarios of its exposure to the ambient or protons coming
from biomass. Representative compounds from fatty acids (from triacylglycerides)
and aromatics (from lignin) were adsorbed on the metal oxide surfaces.
We covered the complete H surface coverage, and the adsorbed molecules
showed structural changes due to the interactions in turn. The driven
force interactions in this process is hydrogen bonding, which reveals
the complexity in biomass processing. H-bonds were fully characterized
by the electron density and its Laplacian where bond critical points
are present. These topological properties allow us to understand the
correlation between the adsorption energies and the strength on each
adsorption site. We also computed the relative Gibbs energies and
harmonic oscillator model of aromaticity index of the adsorbed molecules
to get more insights into their stability.

Introduction
Transformation of biomass
feedstocks into more profitable commodities
is an alternative for providing energy and high value added chemicals
for the new society generations, looking for green and sustainable
technologies.1,2 The direct utilization of biomass
is not possible because of its complex chemical properties. Several
research studies would overcome its intrinsic limitations. For instance,
biomass feedstocks cannot be used immediately as fuels because of
their high oxygen content, which leads to low heating value, immiscibility
with fossil fuels, a tendency for polymerization, thermal instability,
and high viscosity.3 High oxygen content
in these molecules is a feature that needs their transformation into
O-free molecules. The overall challenge with biomass conversion is
how to efficiently remove oxygen from the biomass feedstocks and produce
a molecule that has a high energy density and good combustion properties.4

The aviation sector is facing mounting
pressures to reduce its
greenhouse gas emissions, where biomass-derived jet fuel can provide
a solution to this industry.5,6 Vegetable oils, such
as palm oil, have been good candidates to develop environmental-friendly
and high-quality fuels.7 Hydrocarbon chains
coming from such oils, after the conversion of fatty acids, provide
mixtures that can blend with jet fuel. On the other hand, today, most
of the global bioenergy production and final use comes from lignocellulosic
biomass. Unlike cellulose, with a well-defined sequence of monomeric
units that are linked by regular β-1,4-glycosidic bonds, lignin
is characterized by a variety of distinct and chemically different
bonding motifs, each demanding different conditions for cleavage when
selective depolymerization is targeted.8 The aromatic compounds present in lignin make this feedstock very
attractive to provide aromatic compounds for several high-value industries.

Catalytic upgrading of biomass is used to eliminate oxygen contained
in the organic molecules by hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) and cracking
reactions in the presence of a heterogenous catalyst.9,10 The HDO process takes place at higher H2 pressures and
temperatures, and the catalysts consist typically in MoS2-based active phases supported on metal oxides.11−14 These catalysts were adapted
from the petroleum industry, where they are being used for many years
in the elimination of sulfur and nitrogen atoms from crude oils. Till
date, several research efforts have shown the ability to use other
active phases more appropriate to deal with water environments and
be able to eliminate oxygen from biomass feedstocks. In this line,
the use of MoO3 as an active phase is a promising catalytic
system because it is the precursor from MoS2 and its use
in the HDO of biomass is very much reliable. Results pointed out that
MoO3 is a catalytically active species in the production
of linear hydrocarbon from ketones and cyclic ethers.15 It was also proved effectively in the HDO of aromatic compounds
showing the ability to produce O-free hydrocarbons.16,17 The MoO3 as an active phase has several differences in
its physical and chemical properties than the MoS2 or metallic
active phases.18−20 For instance, MoO3 can be hydrated or
protonated under water environments because of the Mo=O or
Mo–O–Mo surface species, and this might affect its catalytic
performance in biomass conversion.21,22 Even its exposure
to the atmosphere changes its electronic properties, where the reversible
hydration produces changes in color related to different surface species.23,24

Computational studies have been used for a better understanding
of biomass transformation. They have been applied to explain ketonization
reactions over oxide catalysts,25,26 adsorption of aromatic
O-containing molecules on sulfide catalysts,27 as well as the catalytic and thermochemical routes of fatty acids.28,29 On the other hand, using molecules with high molecular weight together
with periodic crystal models with an accurate method is always an
issue for getting useful information; then small molecules and cluster
models have been used computationally.30,31 The presence
of the oxygen atoms with phenolic or acidic functionalities in the
biomass-related products contributes with hydrogen-bonding interactions.
Understanding the H-bonds in catalytic processes is very important
for a better interpretation of the adsorption phenomena as well as
stabilization of substrates or intermediates. The interaction of these
molecules with a catalytic surface of MoO3, where H-bonds
are present, needs to be investigated. Here, we studied the effect
of the hydroxylated species of the MoO3 surface interacting
with biomass model compounds. Our main aim is to get atomistic insights
into the adsorption process by computational calculations. We employed
analytical tools from the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM)
for a better understanding of the interactions taking place in biomass
conversion. We calculated the adsorption energies as well as the topological
properties for characterizing the H-bonds formed between the organic
molecules and the protonated MoO3 surface catalysts.

Results
and Discussion
The optimized geometries for the MoO3 surface with H
surface coverage (σH) at 0 and 100% are shown in Figure 1. After saturation,
slight changes occur mostly on the surface atoms for all the σH. The addition of H produces hydroxylated species by a covalent
O–H bond on the surface. The Mo–O bond length of the
dehydrated surface is 1.720 Å, which can be ascribed to a Mo=O
double bond. After protonation, this bond becomes larger (2.023 Å).
The H atoms in the fully saturated structure are oriented to the closer
oxygen atom. The orientation of all the saturated H is driven by the
intramolecular interaction through hydrogen bridges. The density of
states (DOS) for those structures is depicted in Figure 1. The saturation of the surface
with H atoms produces changes in the electronic structure of MoO3. An additional peak was found for the hydroxylated surface
at about −10.2 eV because of the hydroxyl σ bonding O–H
states. Those results pointed out that surface modifications caused
by the saturation of the surface with H atoms affect the electronic
energy levels of MoO3, considering several possible effects
of the added H atoms on the MoO3 layer.21 The protonation of the MoO3 catalysts are possible
experimentally because of several reasons that are not the main aim
of this study. One reason is the exposure of this material to water
from the atmosphere that can produce this protonated or hydroxylated
surface species. Once this catalyst is in touch with water below the
isoelectric point of the surface using water as a solvent, for example,
electrocatalytic processes must produce surface protonated species.32 The contact of this catalyst with H donating
species such as organic acids might produce protonated species too.
We can also produce this surface species by changing the oxidation
states of Mo in the MoO3 catalysts, which have been demonstrated
to play a major role in different supported species.17 Therefore, the presence of protonated species in this catalytically
active phase is of a paramount importance, given the characteristics
of the biomass-derived products, where water is released from its
chemical reactions and the presence of several molecules with acidic
properties is predominant.

Palmitic Acid
We studied the adsorption
of palmitic
acid (PA) on the MoO3 surfaces at different degrees of
H surface coverage. Optimized geometries at σH =
0 and 100% are shown in Figure 2. The rest of the optimized geometries are shown in Figure S1. The interaction of PA with the surface
atoms take place through H-bonds. In the first case, the H atom from
the carboxylic moiety of PA is interacting with the O atom from the
catalysts. Increasing the degree of hydroxylation provides a larger
number of H-bonds at the catalysts’ surface and structural
modification in the whole interacting system is noticeable. The optimized
geometry for PA and MoO3 at σH = 100%
showed the interaction of the H atom from the PA with the O atom at
the surface. Another type of interaction was found because of the
hydroxylated species at the surface, the O atom from the carbonyl
groups interacts with the H atom from the MoO3 surface.
The adsorption energy for the different degree of H surface coverage
is depicted in Figure 2. We found the maximum adsorption energy (−62 kJ mol–1) at σH = 11%, whereas the maximum is found for
the nonsaturated surface. This indicates that the presence of hydroxylated
species on the surface of MoO3 provides adsorption sites
with higher exothermic values. There are a major number of hydroxylated
species on the catalysts’ surface at higher σH, but the correlation with the adsorption energy is not linear. It
is important to note that these adsorption energy values are correlated
directly with the H-bond interactions between the PA molecule and
the MoO3 surface. It seems that the presence of hydroxylated
species is a positive effect for the adsorption of PA on this material.

(a) 0 and (b) 100% of H surface coverage (σH), (c)
adsorption energy values of PA on MoO3 as
a function of σH.

We employed the QTAIM for a further explanation of the interactions
that take place upon the adsorption of O-containing molecules on MoO3. Briefly, the topology of electron density (ρ) leads
to a partitioning scheme, which defines atoms inside a molecule or
a molecular aggregate via the gradient vector field, ∇ρ.
This vector field is a collection of gradient paths, which are curves
in space that follow the direction of steepest ascent in ρ.
Therefore, a gradient path has a physical meaning; it always starts
and finishes at points where ρ vanishes. These points are called
critical points (CPs). The CPs in ρ are special and useful points
for a given molecule.33 The Laplacian of
the electron density (∇2ρ) is the sum of the
eigenvalues. It has been applied for the characterization of covalent
and ionic bonds; and also used to describe hydrogen bonds and van
der Waals interactions, where ∇2ρ is positive.34

We found two main sites where the molecule
interacts with the catalyst’s
surface. One is found at the OH group from PA and the O atom at the
surface of MoO3, this interaction takes place for all the
σH. On the other hand, we found another site between
the O atom from the carbonyl group of PA and the OH at the MoO3 surface. In some cases, both sites are present and they form
a cyclic species between the PA and the oxide surface as we can appreciate
on Figures 2 and S1. We showed the values for the electron density
and the Laplacian of the electron density in Table 1. We studied the main bond CP (BCP) and identified
them as PA (H) and MoO3 (H). The ρ values for the
interaction between the OH groups in PA and the O atom on the surface
of the MoO3 showed slight changes for the different H surface
coverages, and the values are about 0.1. More drastic changes are
observed on the interaction between the O atom from the carbonyl group
in the PA and the H atom from the catalyst’s surface. In this
interaction, we found the highest values (ρ = 0.302) at σH = 11%, which is located at the higher adsorption energy.
We also calculate the ∇2ρ for both adsorption
sites between PA and MoO3. The values for the ∇2ρ > 0 for all the surface coverages, which is in
good
agreement for the characterization of hydrogen bonds by this topological
property. The values showed that ∇2ρ from
the interaction between OH of PA has a major value (1.837) for σH = 11%. The ∇2ρ for the other adsorption
site also showed the maximum value (5.504) at the same H surface coverage.
The values for the topological properties for both adsorption sites
point out the importance of the hydrogen bonds formed by varying the
number of surface OH groups. Both sites contribute to the adsorption
energy and the electronic density involved in such interactions evinced
the complexity of the adsorption processes of O-containing molecules
on oxide materials. We could appreciate that the interaction is driven
by the OH groups on the catalyst’s surface, while the OH group
at the PA molecules interacting with the O atoms at the surfaces contribute
less to the adsorption energy and almost constant for the complete
range of H surface coverage.

m-Cresol
The optimized geometries
for the adsorption of m-cresol on the MoO3 are shown in Figure 3. We chose the dehydrated and the H fully saturated surfaces to depict
the effect of the H-bonds on the interaction with m-cresol. The O atom from the MoO3 surface interacts with
the H atom from the OH in the m-cresol, and these
H-bonds lead to negative values for its adsorption energy. The fully
saturated surface is plenty of H-bonds, where the H atom from the
organic molecule interacts with an O atom at the surface, while several
H atoms from the surface changed their orientation toward the O atom
of the phenol group. The optimized geometries for the other σH were also analyzed, with H playing a major role in the adsorption
of m-cresol by H-bonds (Figure S2). The adsorption energy for m-cresol on
MoO3 at different degrees of H surface coverage is also
shown in Figure 3.
The presence of hydroxyl groups on the MoO3 surface has
a positive effect on the adsorption energies, as it is more exothermic
because of the H-bonds. It appears to present two adsorption regimes
for σH = 11–60% with an average adsorption
energy of −38 kJ mol–1 and the other between
σH = 78–100% with an average adsorption energy
about −52 kJ mol–1. This feature is related
to the interaction of hydroxyl groups at the surface with the phenolic
group from the organic molecule. We can point out that the increment
on the number of hydroxyl
species on the surface of MoO3 produces more sites for
the adsorption of m-cresol.

for the adsorption of m-cresol
on MoO3 catalysts at (a) 0 and (b) 100% of H surface coverage
(σH), (c) adsorption energy values of m-cresol on MoO3 as a function of σH.

The interaction of m-cresol with the MoO3 surface exhibits several adsorption
sites because of the type/size
of the molecule and its planar structure. Similar to PA, the m-cresol molecule can interact with the surface by its O
atom within the phenol group. This OH group can interact also through
its H atom with the O atoms at the MoO3 catalyst. It means
that the adsorption sites seem to be more localized than the ones
for PA. We studied further those adsorption sites by the QTAIM to
get deeper insights into their type and magnitude. Table 2 enlists the topological properties
for these two adsorption sites. We found only one site from the H
atom in the phenolic moiety interacting with the O atom in the material
surface, while in some cases, we detected the presence of two H atoms
from the MoO3 surface interacting with the O atom in the m-cresol molecule. The electron density for both interaction
sites depends on the degree of saturation. In general, these values
are larger for H surface atoms than the ones for the H atoms within m-cresol. For this molecule, the trend is not linear for
the H surface atoms in some σH values. For instance,
at σH = 11%, ρ = 0.175 for m-cresol (H) and ρ = 0.232 for MoO3 (H), while at
σH = 100%, ρ = 0.210 for m-cresol (H) and ρ1 = 0.103 and ρ2 = 0.094 for MoO3 (H). The presence of two positions for
the adsorption of this organic molecule must contribute to the adsorption
energy, but the electron density within QTAIM at different sites would
not be a simple sum of the contribution of each site. We also calculated
the Laplacian of the electron density for all the sites identified.
These have positive values, which are in good agreement with the H-bond
interactions. This topological property is an appropriated descriptor
for this type of interactions. We found that ∇2ρ
follows a similar trend than the electron density. The highest value
for the Laplacian of the electron density was found at σH = 100% for the m-cresol (H), ∇2ρ = 2.912, while the highest value for the MoO3 (H) is located at σH = 33%, ∇2ρ1 = 2.266 and ∇2ρ2 = 0.157. It is important to mention that the two adsorption sites
have different values depending on the position and the chemical environment.
In all the cases, one showed higher values than the other, the reason
being the major proximity or higher electron density involved in such
interaction.

Guaiacol
The adsorption of guaiacol on the MoO3 was also studied
by varying the H surface coverage. Selected
optimized geometries for this process are depicted in Figure 4. The rest of the optimized
geometries are shown in Figure S3. This
molecule has two substituted oxygen atoms in the benzene moiety, one
in a phenolic group and the other one in a methyl ether group. Both
groups can interact with the H atoms on the oxide surface. This molecule
exhibited a complex behavior because of the presence of hydrophobic
(−OCH3) and hydrophilic (−OH) groups in closer
proximity that restrict or promote the molecule for geometrically
well-defined interactions. At the σH = 0%, the acidic
proton of the phenol group interacts through H-bonds with the O atom
at the surface, while the −OCH3 group is moving
because of the repulsion forces from the methyl group. The orientation
of both groups varies depending on the degree of the surface coverage.
We observe that at σH = 100%, the interaction of
the −OH groups on the catalytic surface with guaiacol is driven
by hydrogen bonds with the O atom in either phenol or ether groups.
The chemical structure of guaiacol changed drastically compared to
the one adsorbed at zero H surface coverage. The methyl group is rotated
to allow the interaction of the oxygen atoms in this ether group with
the H surface atoms. The phenol group interacts toward its H atom
with the O atoms at the surface, while the O atom in this functional
group forms two H-bonds at the surface. The adsorption energy profile
for guaiacol on MoO3 as a function of the surface coverage
is displayed in Figure 4. We observed this value depending on the surface coverage due to
the competition between the attraction and repulsion forces in this
molecule due to H-bonds and van der Waals interactions. As we mentioned
above, the phenol group in this molecule can form attractive interactions
with the surface, while the ether group provides repulsion contribution
from its methyl group and attraction from the O atom in this functional
group. On the other hand, the preference to establish one type of
interaction would be a consequence of the orientation of the molecule
upon adsorption. The largest adsorption energy for guaiacol on MoO3 was obtained for the fully hydroxylated surface, while the
lowest is reached at about 80%. Indeed, the profile of the adsorption
energy of this molecule is related to the presence of both hydrophobic
and hydrophilic groups in the molecule and the configuration changing
upon adsorption. We can suggest that the hydroxylated surfaces might
promote important structural changes by rotating the substituting
groups in benzene.

MoO3 catalysts at (a) 0 and (b) 100% of H surface coverage
(σH), (c) adsorption energy values of guaiacol on
MoO3 as a function of σH.

The topological properties for the adsorption of
guaiacol on the
surface of MoO3 was further studied by the QTAIM. Table 3 depicts the values
for the ρ and the ∇2ρ at the BCP. Similar
to the other oxygenated molecules analyzed in this work, we found
two distinct adsorption sites, one for the −OH at the oxide
surface and other for the −OH group in guaiacol. The surface
at 0 % coverage showed only one site for adsorption, and it is formed
by the −OH group in guaiacol and the O atom in the MoO3 surface with ρ = 0.118 and the Laplacian of 1.834.
These values increased for higher σH, and the hydroxylated
species contribute with more adsorption sites, the increasing number
of adsorption sites and their larger values showed a correlation with
the adsorption energies. The smallest adsorption energy was observed
at σH = 78%, and we could appreciate that oxygen
from the −OCH3 and −OH groups are the atoms
that interact with the H surface atoms and it showed the lowest values
for (−OCH3) ρ1 = 0.103 and ∇2ρ1 = 1.548 and (−OH) ρ2 = 0.112 and ∇2ρ2 = 1.068, while
the hydrogen atom from the phenolic group does not interact with any
oxygen atom at the surface. This null interaction of the proton from
the phenol group is a consequence of the optimized adsorption geometry
where the guaiacol molecule needs to be accommodated on the MoO3 surface. On the other hand, the topological properties of
the adsorption sites changed drastically at full coverage of the oxide
surface σH = 100%. We also found the largest value
for the adsorption energy at this surface coverage. The values for
the proton from the phenolic group are ρ = 0.276 and ∇2ρ = 3.160, which are the highest for this adsorption
site in the guaiacol adsorption. The values for the interaction of
the oxygen atoms in the organic molecule with the H atoms at the oxide
surface showed also higher values for the topological properties.
For instance, the electron density for this BCP for the −OCH3 and −OH are 0.158 and 0.308, respectively, while the
values for the Laplacian of the electron density are also higher (−OCH3) 1.991 and (−OH) 3.233. With the help of these analytical
tools provided by the QTAIM, we can understand the nonlinear profile
of the adsorption energy of the guaiacol on the surface of MoO3. We can correlate the adsorption energies with the type and
strength of the interaction of the different atoms and functional
groups involved on the adsorption sites. Guaiacol exhibits a very
complex behavior upon interaction with a hydroxylated MoO3 surface. This is just a model compound from biomass. If we think
about the complexity of the functional groups present in lignin-based
biomolecules, the interaction with an oxide surface would become much
more complex. Therefore, the catalytic transformation of those biomass
feedstocks must consider the importance of the hydroxylated degree
of the catalysts for its adsorption and further transformation.

Structural Modification of the Organic Molecules
We
analyzed the interaction of representative model compounds from biomass,
namely, PA (fatty acids, vegetable oils), m-cresol,
and guaiacol (aromatics and lignin) with a catalytic surface of MoO3 at different H surface coverages for a better understanding
of the factors that direct their adsorption and further transformation.
We found important differences on the adsorption energies by varying
the H surface coverage, which were further studied by the QTAIM. The
organic molecules changed their structures because of the hydrophobic
or hydrophilic character of the surface. Selected structural parameters
of the ground state and the adsorbed molecules are shown in Tables S1–S3. The bond length and the
angles for the atoms are responsible for the adsorption process, and
the closer ones suffered more changes compared to the ground-state
structures. These changes might play an important role for its transformation
or stability on the catalytic surface. We calculate the Gibbs energy
for the organic molecules adsorbed on the MoO3 at the different
hydroxylated degrees. The relative Gibbs energy for all the molecules
is plotted in Figure 5. Because of the structural changes, the relative energy of all the
molecules is positive compared to its ground state. This means that
the molecules adsorbed on the MoO3 surface are less stable
than the ground state. However, this instability depends strongly
on the hydroxylated degree of the catalytic surface. For instance,
PA and m-cresol adsorbed on the oxide surface seem
to be relative stable at σH = 0%. It is important
to mention that the structural changes take place to accommodate the
organic molecules adsorbed on the surface and this is related to the
H bonding formed on the system. These instable structures might be
easier to be converted on the catalytic surface upon adsorption. PA
showed more regions of higher relative instabilities ranging from
15 to 25 kJ mol–1 at σH = 11–100%,
while m-cresol did not change its structure drastically,
and its relative Gibbs energy varies from 5 to 10 kJ mol–1 from all the σH ranges. On the other hand, similar
to the analysis of the adsorption energies, the behavior of the structural
stability for guaiacol is complex. The regions of less instability
are located between σH = 11–80% mostly, while
it is more instable at low and higher H surface coverages. The presence
of the hydroxylated species on the MoO3 surface favors
the destabilization of the organic molecules, which can lead to their
further transformation.

function of H surface coverage.

Organic molecules in lignin are composed by linked aromatic
rings,
with a very stable character for its transformation. Therefore, the
two aromatic model compounds in this study were further studied by
the harmonic oscillator model of aromaticity (HOMA) calculations,
an aromatic index. It was calculated for the benzene rings for m-cresol and guaiacol structures adsorbed on the oxide surfaces
in the whole hydroxylated scenarios (Table 4). The HOMA values for the ground-state molecules
for both m-cresol and guaiacol are close to 1, which
is in agreement with an aromatic molecule. The HOMA values decreased
(losing aromaticity) for both aromatic molecules adsorbed on the MoO3 surfaces because of their structural and electronic changes
in this process. In general, the aromatic character for guaiacol decreased
more than m-cresol at the different degree of σH. This result agrees with the structural changes detected
upon adsorption; guaiacol suffered more changes because of its structure
adsorbed on the oxide surface. This feature of the O-containing molecules
is a driven force for the adsorption processes that might be considered
for a better understanding in the biomass transformations.

A comparison with experimental
data is possible mostly for the
aromatic molecules in this study. For guaiacol and m-cresol, their conversion over the MoO3 catalyst has been
reported to be about 74 and 49%, respectively. The adsorption energies
for guaiacol are more exothermic than m-cresol in
the range of σH studied, which might be related to
their experimental conversion using this catalytically active phase.
Higher conversion is achieved because of a more favorable interaction
of guaiacol with this catalytic surface. We also observed the interaction
of the −OCH3 group from guaiacol in different surface
coverages with important contributions in the bonding parameters (specially
at σH ≥ 78%). These results are also related
to the reaction network of guaiacol in the HDO, where demethylation
reactions have been reported.35 We can
state that the protonated surfaces of the MoO3-based catalysts
are more likely active for demethylation reactions, and these can
be produced for water releasing or changes in acidic properties of
solvent or reaction media. On the other hand, the stability and aromaticity
of guaiacol decreased much more than the values for m-cresol in all the protonated regimes. Both results are also in good
agreement with the higher reactivity of guaiacol compared with m-cresol. The interaction of m-cresol with
the different MoO3 catalytic surfaces maintains a more
stable aromatic molecule that must be low reactive than its adsorbed
counterparts from guaiacol.

Conclusions
The
interaction of the products derived from biomass showed different
scenarios depending on the degree of H surface coverage of the MoO3. Fatty acids interact mainly by one site with the carboxylic
groups attached by hydrogen bonds on the MoO3 surface.
The phenol-type compounds showed more than one site for adsorption
leading to more complex interacting structures. The main driven force
for the interaction of O-containing molecules with this catalytic
surface is hydrogen bonding. These H-bonds showed different adsorbed
structures on the MoO3 catalysts, where the molecules are
feasible to interact under hydrogen-rich surroundings. The characterization
of them by the topological properties sheds light into the strength,
and some correlations with adsorption energies were established. The
electron density together with the Laplacian of the electron density
showed numerical values for direct correlations in atom to atom interactions.
These topological properties are well correlated to the adsorption
sites. The molecules present in biomass contain several electronegative
atoms (oxygen mostly), which will be targeted for their transformation.
Therefore, the use of the analytical tools provided by the QTAIM could
be extensively used. Additionally, we calculated the HOMA index and
stability of the adsorbed molecules on the MoO3 surface.
These results explained the differences in reactivity of the two aromatic
molecules, where m-cresol is more stable than guaiacol.
In the context of catalytic processes, these results might be of interest
for the community to fully characterize specific atomic interactions
and the further transformation within a specific site of the molecule.

Computational
Details
We chose representative O-containing molecules from
biomass feedstocks.
PA is a model compound of fatty acids (coming from triacylglycerides),
whereas m-cresol and guaiacol are aromatic model
compounds obtained from lignin depolymerization. The three organic
compounds were adsorbed on a catalytic surface of MoO3.
We studied the effect of the H surface coverage (σH) and the interaction of those molecules in a complete range of hydrogen
coverage.

The surface model was represented with a 3D periodic
slab model
taking from the crystal structure of MoO3. This model consists
of 72 atoms. Geometry optimization and electronic properties were
carried out using the revised version of the PBE36 functional that has shown excellent performance for chemisorption
in catalysis,37 using double numerical
with polarization basis sets. Atomic coordinates of the internal atoms
were fixed and the surface atoms were allowed full optimization. The
adsorbed organic molecules were fully optimized in all the calculations.
The threshold of density matrix convergence was set to 10–6. A Fermi smearing of 0.005 Ha and a real-space cutoff of 4.9 Å
were also used to get the computational convergence for this system.
Adsorption energies were obtained at the same level of theory. These
were calculated as ΔE = Emol/cat – (Emol + Ecat), where Emol = energy of the molecule, Ecat = energy
of the MoO3, and Emol/cat =
adsorbed molecule on the MoO3. The calculations were performed
with the DMol3 software.

The QTAIM38 was used to study the topological
properties on the adsorption sites. We found different sites of interaction
depending on the molecule and the degree of surface coverage. More
specifically, we identified hydrogen bonding interactions due to the
presence of electronegative atoms (O) either in the organic molecules
or in the oxide surface. These sites were fully characterized by their
topological properties such as electron density (ρ) and the
Laplacian of the electron density (∇2ρ).39 Given the complexity of studying topological
properties in the periodic system, we found AIM-UC40 software very suitable for the analysis of the DMol3 files.

We took the optimized structures of the adsorbed
organic molecules
and calculated the single-point energy on each geometry, and we carried
out the computation of vibration analysis to get the values of Gibbs
energy at the M06-2X level of theory using the triple zeta basis set
with polarization. These calculations were carried out with NWChem
software.41

Aromaticity studies were
conducted on the single-point structure
of the m-cresol and guaiacol molecules adsorbed on
the different hydroxylates surfaces. We employed a structure-based
index of aromaticity, the so-called HOMA. Its definition is  where n is the number of
bonds taken into summation and α is an empirical constant fixed
to give HOMA = 0 for a Kekulé structure of the aromatic benzene
and equal to 1 for the system with all bonds equal to the optimal
value Ropt.42 Aromaticity studies were carried out in the multifunctional wavefunction
analyzer (Multiwfn).43
