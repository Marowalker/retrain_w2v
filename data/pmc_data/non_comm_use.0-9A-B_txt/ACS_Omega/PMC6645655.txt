A facile improved successive ionic-layer
adsorption and reaction
(SILAR) sequence is described for the fabrication of Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) thin-film solar cells (TFSCs) via
the selenization of a precursor film. The precursor films were fabricated
using a modified SILAR sequence to overcome compositional inhomogeneity
due to different adsorptivities of the cations (Cu+, Sn4+, and Zn2+) in a single cationic bath. Rapid thermal
annealing of the precursor films under S and Se vapor atmospheres
led to the formation of carbon-free Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) and CZTSSe absorber layers, respectively, with single large-grained
layers. The best devices based on CZTS and CZTSSe absorber layers
showed total area (∼0.30 cm2) power conversion efficiencies
(PCEs) of 1.96 and 3.74%, respectively, which are notably the first-demonstrated
efficiencies using a modified SILAR sequence. Detailed diode analyses
of these solar cells revealed that a high shunt conductance (Gsh), reverse saturation current density (Jo), and ideality factor (nd) significantly affected the PCE, open-circuit voltage (Voc), and fill factor (FF), whereas the short-circuit
current density (Jsc) was dominated by
the series resistance (Rs) and Gsh. However, the diode analyses combined with
the compositional and interface microstructural analyses shed light
on further improvements to the device efficiency. The facile layer-by-layer
growth of the kesterite CZTS-based thin films in aqueous solution
provides a great promise as an environmentally benign pathway to fabricate
a variety of multielement-component compounds with high compositional
homogeneities.

Introduction
Kesterite Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS), Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe),
and Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) have been widely
studied as promising alternatives to well-established
Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 absorbers in thin-film solar cells (TFSCs)
because they contain low-cost and earth-abundant constituents, have
high absorption coefficients (>104 cm–1), and have tunable optical band gaps (in the range of 1–1.5
eV) for efficient solar-energy harvesting.1,2 Scalable
solution-processing methods of these earth-abundant compounds have
attracted increasing attention owing to their low cost, high-throughput
capability, and compatibility with a variety of substrates.3,4 A state-of-the-art power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.7% has
been achieved for a CZTSSe TFSC using hydrazine-based solution processing
employing a double In2S3/CdS emitter.5 However, despite the record efficiency of the
state-of-the-art CZTSSe TFSC, hydrazine is highly toxic and flammable,
which requires various handling precautions during precursor solution
and thin-film preparation, limiting the use of this solution-processing
technique to grow CZTSSe absorbers in a viable manner for commercialization.6−8 Several nonhydrazine approaches have been reported for the preparation
of CZTSSe absorber layers.9−16 A number of attractive efficiencies have been achieved for CZTSSe
TFSCs using these solution-based approaches, such as 8.08% by a hydrazine
derivative,9 8.25% by metal salts/thiourea,10 6.03% by a metal oxide,12 11.2% by DMSO,13 and 7.86% by an amine–thiol
solvent mixture.15 Despite these attractive
efficiencies, most of these direct-solution-based approaches generally
introduce carbon and oxygen impurities into the absorber because of
the incomplete decomposition of the soluble precursors.9−16 This would eventually lead to deviation in the composition along
the depth direction in the bilayered microstructure.6,12,16 Therefore, it is of immense importance
to develop an alternative, facile aqueous-based solution approach
to prepare high-quality absorber layers for practical applications.

Bath-based aqueous-solution approaches, such as electrodeposition,
chemical bath deposition (CBD), and successive ionic-layer adsorption
and reaction (SILAR), are promising approaches because of their simplicity,
cost effectiveness, high material utilization, and low-temperature
processing to prepare large-area and uniform absorber layers for high-efficiency
TFSCs.17−20 Although a highest efficiency of ∼9.9% has been achieved
for an electrodeposited CZTSSe TFSC, there are several issues associated
with the electrodeposition of CZTS-based absorber layers.21 Electrodeposition of stacked elemental layers
often results in spatial compositional inhomogeneity in the absorber
layer after sulfurization/selenization owing to the nonuniform deposition
of Zn on the islandlike growth of Sn onto the Cu surface.22,23 On the other hand, coelectroplating of the precursors shows a dendritic
growth, which generally results in an uneven surface microstructure
with spatial distribution of micron-sized grains after sulfurization/selenization.24 A very little amount of work has also been done
on the preparation of CZTSSe absorber layers using CBD, showing a
preliminary efficiency of ∼3% for a CZTSSe TFSC.19 The CBD approach used for the preparation of
CZTSSe absorber layers involves the deposition of stacked SnS, elemental
Cu, and ZnS layers. The deposition of the stacked metal–sulfide
layers using CBD involves a controlled precipitation reaction between
two or multiple precursors in a single solution, typically using a
complexing agent or organic precursors at a certain reaction temperature.19 This leads to a heterogeneous nucleation and
probably nonuniform growth of metal–sulfide-stacked precursors.
As a result, absorber layers after sulfurization/selenization show
small pinholes with uneven distributions of isolated grains and high
densities of voids at the absorber/Mo interface.19 Among the bath-based aqueous-solution approaches, the SILAR
approach overcomes the issues associated with electrodeposition and
CBD approaches. Additionally, it is simple and inexpensive, does not
require costly equipment, and can be carried out at room temperature.25−27 In a SILAR approach, precursor reagents are segregated into two
different cationic and anionic precursor solutions. The precursor
film deposition is further carried out by immersing the substrates
sequentially in cationic and anionic solutions with rinsing in between,
which leads to the formation of a compact, uniform, and nanocrystalline
precursor film with high control over the composition. However, adsorptivities
of the cations (Cu+, Sn4+, and Zn2+) in a multicationic CZTS compound is different in a single cationic
bath, which results in a complete deviation in the composition of
CZTS thin films prepared using a single-step SILAR method.25−27 To overcome these issues, we have demonstrated a modified SILAR
sequence to prepare good-quality CZTS thin films with compositional
uniformity in our previous reports.25,26 Although detailed
studies on the influences of the preparative parameters on the properties
have been investigated, the fabrication of CZTSSe TFSCs using a SILAR
approach remains unexplored. Table 1 briefly summarizes the representative results based
on CZTSSe TFSCs from bath-based aqueous-solution-processing and direct-solution-coating
techniques.

Here, for the
first time, we report the fabrication of CZTSSe TFSCs
using a facile, versatile, and environmental benign-modified SILAR
sequence. More specifically, CZTS precursor films were prepared using
a modified SILAR sequence with slight modifications to our previous
recipe.25,26,28 Several modifications
have been made to prepare precursor films using a modified SILAR sequence,
namely, (i) the replacement of the cationic source of SnSO4 by more stable SnCl2 and (ii) the addition of NH4F as a complexing agent in a cationic bath containing Cu+ and Sn4+ species. The as-deposited precursor films
were then subjected to a high-temperature heat treatment in a rapid
thermal annealing (RTA) furnace under an S or S/Se vapor atmosphere
to form highly crystallized CZTS or CZTSSe absorber layers, respectively,
which avoided the use of highly toxic H2S and H2Se in the postannealing process for absorber formation. Our preliminary
device based on the CZTSSe absorber layer exhibited a PCE of ∼3.74%,
which is notably the first reported efficiency for a CZTSSe TFSC prepared
using a SILAR approach. A possible recombination loss mechanism in
the absorber layers has been investigated by performing a diode analysis
in detail. Furthermore, possible strategies for improving the device
performance are put forth based on the results obtained from the diode
analysis combined with the compositional and interface microstructural
analyses.

Results and Discussion
It has been reported that the
deposition of quaternary compounds
with compositional homogeneity is cumbersome using the conventional
SILAR process because of the different adsorptivities of the metal
cations in a single cationic bath.26−28 To overcome these issues,
we developed a modified SILAR sequence approach by separating a single
cationic bath into two separate baths, namely, a Cu+ and
Sn4+ cationic bath and a Zn2+ cationic bath.25,26,28 Although pure-phase CZTS thin
films with controllable compositions have been prepared, the former
cationic bath was not stable, which underwent precipitation after
20 SILAR cycles (Figure S1a). In this study,
we replaced SnSO4 by SnCl2, which is more stable
because of the inert-pair effect. Additionally, NH4F was
used as a complexing agent to improve the stability of Cu+ and Sn4+ in the cationic bath. It was found that the
cationic bath became less prone to precipitation after the addition
of NH4F, which led to a stable bath for an extended period
(Figure S1b). A series of experiments were
carried out, and suitable conditions for the deposition of precursor
films with compositional homogeneities were determined to be a combined
effect of using separate cationic baths and NH4F as a complexing
agent during the deposition for the cationic bath containing Cu+ and Sn4+ species.

Figure 1a,b shows
the field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images of
the modified SILAR-deposited precursor films. A compact and dense
nanocrystalline precursor film with a thickness of ∼1 μm
was deposited after 100 SILAR cycles. The compositional homogeneity
in the precursor was confirmed from energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX)
elemental mapping (Figure 1a, right panel). The formation of carbon-free precursor films
was further confirmed from the EDX elemental line scan analysis, as
shown in Figure 1c.
The phases of the precursor films were also confirmed using X-ray
diffraction (XRD), which showed broad diffraction peaks, indicating
the nanocrystalline nature of the precursor films (Figure 1d). The crystallite size determined
using the Scherrer equation was 6.8 nm.

The microstructure of an absorber layer is one critical factor
that influences the device performance of kesterite solar cells. It
is well-known that a compact, uniform, and void-free microstructure
with densely packed large grains is highly desirable for high-efficiency
CZTSSe TFSCs.10,12,14,15 This can be achieved by annealing the precursors
at a temperature above 500 °C. However, the heat treatment above
500 °C for an extended period may result in elemental losses
or phase segregation as well as may form a thick Mo(S,Se)2 layer at the CZTSSe/Mo interface, which degrades the device performance.14 Therefore, the optimization of the postannealing
conditions is crucial for obtaining a device-quality CZTSSe absorber
layer. Figure 2 shows
the surface (top view) and cross-sectional FE-SEM images of the sulfurized
CZTS and selenized CZTSSe absorber layers. The sulfurized CZTS film
shows a smooth, compact, and highly crystallized surface morphology
with a thickness of ∼1.1 μm (Figure 2a,c). However, a few voids (as marked by
the red-dotted circles in Figure 2a) were clearly seen on the CZTS absorber surface.
Notably, it was found that the selenization treatment under a Se vapor
atmosphere improved the microstructure of the CZTSSe absorber layer
to large grains, which implies that Se incorporation is conducive
to crystal growth (Figure 2b).29 The CZTSSe absorber layer
exhibits a highly dense microstructure consisting of large grains
with a thickness of ∼1.4 μm (Figure 2d). The cross-sectional FE-SEM image further
reveals the formation of a single, large-grained layer extending along
the depth direction and a thin (∼80 nm) Mo(S,Se)2 layer formation at the CZTSSe/Mo interface. Because the Se vapor
pressure significantly affected the microstructure of the CZTSSe absorber
layers, the influence of the Se vapor pressure on the microstructure
of CZTSSe was also studied by varying the Se powder quantity during
selenization. Figure S2 shows the surface
(top view) and cross-sectional FE-SEM images of the CZTSSe absorber
layers annealed under different Se vapor pressures. With an increase
in the Se vapor pressure, the microstructure and grain size of the
CZTSSe absorber layer were enhanced significantly. Although the CZTSSe
absorber layer selenized at a lower Se vapor pressure (50 mg of Se)
exhibited a compact and dense microstructure, it showed partially
crystallized grains with relatively small sizes as compared to the
other samples (Figure S2a,b). On the other
hand, the CZTSSe absorber layer selenized at a higher Se vapor pressure
(300 and 450 mg of Se) showed a well-crystallized, large-grained absorber
layer with the formation of a thicker Mo(S,Se)2 layer (∼430
nm for 300 mg of Se (Figure S2f) and ∼900
nm for 450 mg of Se (Figure S2h)) at the
CZTSSe/Mo interface. Additionally, the absorber layer selenized at
a higher Se vapor pressure (450 mg of Se) showed an additional impurity
phase on the surface (marked by the red-dotted circles in Figure S2g). It has been reported that the phase
separation and a thicker Mo(S,Se)2 layer at the CZTSSe/Mo
interface can seriously damage the performance of a CZTSSe TFSC.10,14 In addition, a partially crystallized absorber layer with smaller
grains can lead to recombination losses and thus reduce the device
performance.7,14,16

It is well-known that the chemical composition of an absorber
layer
is another critical factor, which can significantly influence the
device performance of a kesterite solar cell.18,21 It has been evidenced that high-efficiency kesterite solar cells
can be obtained with Cu-poor and Zn-rich compositions in a wide range
of Cu/(Zn + Sn) and Zn/Sn ratios of 0.75–0.95 and 1.1–1.4,
respectively.1,2,30,31 The Cu-poor composition gives rise to shallow
acceptors in the absorbers layers via the formation of Cu vacancies,
whereas the Zn-rich composition results in relatively deep acceptors
by avoiding the formation of unfavorable CuZn antisites
that have a negative formation energy.6,12 X-ray fluorescence
(XRF) spectroscopy was employed to determine the elemental compositions
of the CZTS and CZTSSe thin films. The XRF results revealed that the
sulfurized films showed compositional ratios of Cu/(Zn + Sn) = 0.82
and Zn/Sn = 1.18, whereas the selenized CZTSSe films had compositional
ratios of Cu/(Zn + Sn) = 0.86 and Zn/Sn = 1.25, indicating slight
Sn loss after the annealing treatment. However, the obtained compositional
ratios for the CZTS and CZTSSe absorber layers are consistent with
those previously reported for high-efficiency kesterite solar cells.6,12,15−18 The optimal S/(S + Se) ratio
of 0.38 was achieved by optimizing the Se flux quantity during the
selenization process. Thus, on the basis of the microstructural and
compositional analyses, we prepared a CZTSSe absorber layer selenized
at a moderate Se vapor pressure (150 mg of Se) that exhibits a compact
and a highly crystallized microstructure with large grains and an
S/(S + Se) compositional ratio of 0.38 for the fabrication of efficient
CZTSSe TFSCs.

The phases and crystal structures of the annealed
CZTS and CZTSSe
films were examined by XRD, and their XRD patterns are depicted in Figure 3a. The heat treatment
under a S vapor atmosphere transformed the nanocrystalline structure
into highly crystalline CZTS, which is further revealed by the presence
of major diffraction peaks along the [112], [220], and [312] directions,
corresponding to the kesterite CZTS (JCPDS no. 26-0575).32,33 The peak marked by an asterisk (*) at 40.5° corresponds to
the Mo substrate (JCPDS card no. 3-065-7442). No noticeable impurity
peaks were observed. After annealing under a Se vapor atmosphere,
the XRD peaks of the sample shifted toward lower 2θ angles,
which is attributed to the unit cell volume expansion due to the partial
replacement of S by Se.7,10,12 An enlarged view of the major diffraction peak is shown in Figure S3 to further confirm the shift of the
diffraction peak after Se incorporation in the absorber layer. It
was obvious that the XRD peaks of the CZTS and CZTSSe films after
annealing under S and Se vapor atmospheres became significantly sharper
compared to that of the precursor films, indicating the improved crystallinity
of the CZTS and CZTSSe films. Furthermore, the crystallite sizes were
calculated using the Scherrer equation from the major diffraction
peak and were found to be 18.6 and 23.2 nm for the CZTS and CZTSSe
films, respectively. Although the XRD analyses of the CZTS and CZTSSe
thin films revealed typical kesterite structures without any traces
of secondary phases, such as Cu2Sn(S,Se)3, Cux(S,Se)y, Sn(S,Se)2, and Zn(S,Se)2, XRD alone cannot clarify the existence
of secondary phases because their XRD patterns are very close to that
of CZTS/CZTSSe.34,35 A pure kesterite phase is crucial
for high-efficiency CZTS-based TFSCs. Therefore, Raman spectroscopy
measurements were carried out to determine the phase purity of the
CZTS and CZTSSe thin films. Figure 3b shows the Raman spectra of the CZTS and CZTSSe thin
films annealed under S and Se vapor atmospheres. As demonstrated in Figure 3b, the CZTS film
shows a major Raman peak at 337 cm–1 and weak Raman
peaks at 288 and 367 cm–1, which are consistent
with those of previously reported kesterite CZTS thin films.26,27 On the other hand, the selenized CZTSSe thin film exhibits main
Raman peaks at 208 and 329 cm–1, which are in good
agreement with the literature results for CZTSSe films.12,29 No observable impurity phases, such as Cu2Sn(S,Se)3, Cux(S,Se)y, Sn(S,Se)2, and Zn(S,Se)2, or ordered
vacancy compounds were detected within the limit of the experimental
precision in the CZTS and CZTSSe thin films. Thus, it is concluded
that the pure-phase CZTS and CZTSSe thin films were achieved after
annealing under S and Se vapor atmospheres using the complementary
studies based on XRD and Raman spectroscopy.

(b) Raman spectra of the annealed CZTS and
CZTSSe thin films.

The CZTSSe films were
further characterized by XPS to analyze the
oxidation states of Cu, Zn, Sn, S, and Se ions. Figure 4 shows the core-level XPS spectra of Cu,
Zn, Sn, S, and Se elements. The Cu 2p peaks are located at 932.8 and
952.7 eV, with a peak splitting value of 19.9 eV (Figure 4a), corresponding to a Cu+ state.26,27 The Zn 2p peaks appeared at 1022.5
and 1045.5 eV, with a peak splitting value of 23 eV (Figure 4b), which is consistent with
the literature values reported for a Zn2+ state.26,27 The valence state of Sn4+ was confirmed by the presence
of binding energy (BE) peaks at 486.1 and 494.4 eV with a peak splitting
value of 8.3 eV (Figure 4c).26,27 It is concluded that when CuSO4·5H2O and SnCl2 were dissolved in deionized
(DI) water in the cationic bath, the respective Cu2+ and
Sn2+ cations in the bath led to the occurrence of redox
reaction between the Cu2+ and Sn2+ cations that
resulted in the formation of Cu+ and Sn4+.27 Four peaks at BEs of 160.6, 161.5, 162.6, and
165.8 eV were observed in the S 2p spectrum (Figure 4d).33 The BE peaks
at 160.6, 161.5, and 162.6 eV are attributed to the S 2p core, which
is in accordance with the 160–164 eV range for S in a sulfide
state, whereas the latter (165.8 eV) is ascribed to the Se 3p core.
The Se 3d spectrum further confirms Se(II) by the presence of peaks
at BEs of 53.8 and 54.7 eV (Figure 4e), which is consistent with the literature for Se
in a selenide state.33,36

To demonstrate the effectiveness of the modified SILAR sequence,
CZTS and CZTSSe TFSCs were fabricated with a standard configuration. Figure 5a shows the current
density–voltage (J–V) characteristics under AM 1.5G illumination for the CZTS and CZTSSe
TFSCs. The obtained device parameters are listed in Table 2. The CZTS TFSC showed a short-circuit
current density (Jsc) of ∼12.43
mA/cm2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.404 V, a fill factor (FF) of 39%, and a PCE of 1.96%.
Interestingly, Se incorporation led to an improved PCE of ∼3.74%
and a Jsc of ∼23.19 mA/cm2 with a Voc of 0.359 V and an FF of 45%
for the CZTSSe TFSC. The significant enhancement in the PCE of the
CZTSSe TFSC compared to that of the CZTS TFSC is solely attributed
to the incorporation of Se, which improves the Jsc of devices by reducing the band gap of the absorber layer.
Further insights into the improved Jsc and band gap will be discussed based on the external quantum efficiency
(EQE) measurements in the next section. To further demonstrate the
effectiveness of the modified SILAR sequence to prepare good-quality
absorber layers, a statistical analysis of the CZTS and CZTSSe TFSCs
was carried out and is presented in Figure S4. A CZTS and CZTSSe devices consisting of six solar cells were fabricated
on the same substrate, and their PCEs were found to be in the range
of 1.76–1.96% for CZTS and 3.36–3.74% for CZTSSe. In
addition, the stabilities of the CZTS and CZTSSe TFSCs were evaluated
and are shown in Figure S5. A slight decrease
of approximately 0.3 and 0.2% were observed for the CZTS and CZTSSe
TFSCs, respectively, after storing for 3 months at room temperature
without encapsulation in an ambient air.

To investigate the photogenerated charge-carrier
absorption and
collection in the corresponding devices, the EQE spectra were measured
and are shown in Figure 5b. The EQE of the CZTS TFSC had a maximum value of approximately
43%, whereas the CZTSSe TFSC had a maximum value of 67%. In both devices,
the EQE spectra decreased at shorter wavelengths because of the strong
absorption by the CdS layer (Eg = 2.4
eV and absorption onset of 516 nm). However, the decrease in the EQE
values at longer wavelengths in both devices might be attributed to
the insufficient generation and loss of deeply adsorbed photons.37,38 The calculated Jsc values for the CZTS
and CZTSSe TFSCs from the EQE spectra exhibit negligible difference
from the Jsc values obtained from the J–V curves recorded under 1.5 AM
illumination, which are listed in Table 2. Furthermore, the band gaps of the CZTS
and CZTSSe were found to be 1.41 and 1.24 eV, respectively, which
were obtained from linear extrapolation of [hν
ln(1 – EQE)]2 versus (hν)
plots (Figure S6). Although the Se incorporation
was found to improve the device performance of the modified SILAR-fabricated
CZTSSe TFSC, the obtained Jsc and PCE
values were significantly lower than those of a solution-processed
high-efficiency CZTSSe TFSC reported in the literature.12−16 It has been reported that the high-efficiency CZTSSe TFSCs was achieved
with a band gap energy of 1.13 eV by controlling the S/(S + Se) ratio
close to 0.30, as reported by Kim et al.5 for the state-of-the-art record-efficiency CZTSSe TFSCs. The lower
efficiency in our CZTSSe device could be because of the relatively
higher band gap energy of 1.24 eV with the S/(S + Se) ratio of ∼0.38.
To achieve a high Se content in the absorber layer to further reduce
the band gap energy, an extremely high Se vapor pressure is required
during the selenization process. This led to the deterioration of
the absorber quality in terms of its microstructure to a relatively
rough and nonuniform surface and the formation of a very thick Mo(S,Se)2 layer (∼900 nm) at the absorber/Mo interface (Figure S2f). This introduces a significantly
higher shunt conductance (Gsh) and series
resistance (Rs) in the device and thus
degrades the performance of the device. Similar results have been
reported by other groups for CZTSSe TFSCs with a thick Mo(S,Se)2 layer.30,39

Because the charge-carrier
recombination mechanisms dominate device
performances, the J–V curves
in dark conditions were further recorded to investigate the possible
loss mechanisms in the CZTS and CZTSSe absorber layers. The dark J–V curves redrawn in the three
successive plots were used to calculate the diode parameters, Gsh, Rs, ideality
factor (nd), and reverse saturation current
density (Jo), using standard analysis
for TFSCs (Figure 6).40 The obtained values of Gsh, Rs, nd, and Jo are listed in Table 2. The plots of dJ/dV versus V as shown
in Figure 6a were used
to evaluate the Gsh values. Figure 6b shows the plots of dV/dJ versus (1/(J + Jsc)) to determine the Rs and nd values from the y-intercept and the slope of the plots, respectively. Furthermore,
the Jo values were extracted from the y-intercept of the semilogarithmic plots of (J + Jsc – GV)
versus (V – RJ) (Figure 6c). The Gsh values were found to be 6.9 and 3.2 mS/cm2 for the CZTS and CZTSSe TFSCs, respectively. Although the Gsh value was improved (lower) after Se incorporation,
the obtained value is relatively higher than those of high-efficiency
CZTSSe TFSCs (<1 mS/cm2).5 It is well-known that Se incorporation significantly improves the
grain size and absorber quality along with the formation of Mo(S,Se)2 at the absorber/Mo interface because of the high Se vapor
pressure during selenization. The enhanced absorber quality with larger
grains decreases the Rs value, whereas
the latter makes the Rs value increase.
Xiao et al.14 reported that a variation
in the Rs value does not necessarily come
from a contribution of the Mo(S,Se)2 layer but rather from
a contribution of the CZTSSe absorber layer. The obtained Rs values in our study were found to be 9.1 and
3.06 Ω cm2 for the CZTS and CZTSSe TFSCs, respectively.
Although Se incorporation led to the formation of a thin Mo(S,Se)2 layer at the absorber/Mo interface, it improved the grain
size and absorber quality with a reduced defect density that resulted
in decreased Gsh and Rs values in the CZTSSe TFSC.41 In addition, the improved absorber quality in terms of the nd and Jo values
could also be beneficial for the significantly enhanced device performance
of the CZTSSe TFSC. Although the efficiencies of our bath-based aqueous-solution-processed
CZTS/CZTSSe TFSCs via a modified SILAR sequence are relatively lower
than those of the TFSCs fabricated using direct-solution-coating processes,
further improvements in the device performance are expected after
detailed studies to solve several issues. The possible reasons for
the low efficiencies are (i) low FF, (ii) low Jsc, (iii) high Rs, and (iv) slightly
deviated compositions owing to less reactive Zn cations. Furthermore,
the optimization to improve the absorber quality with larger grain
sizes eliminated the voids at the absorber/Mo interface, and a reduced/eliminated
Mo(S,Se)2 interfacial layer is expected to contribute significantly
to an enhanced device efficiency. In this regard, an effective strategy
suggested by Li et al.42 can be adopted
to suppress the formation of a thick MoSe2 layer at the
absorber/Mo interface by forming the alloy layer via a soft-annealing
process and by controlling the time during the selenization process,
which will be further studied in our future works.

CZTS and CZTSSe TFSCs: (a) plots of dJ/dV vs V for Gsh estimation;
(b) plots of dV/dJ vs (J + Jsc)−1 for the calculations
of Rs and nd; and (c) semilogarithmic
plots of (J + Jsc – GV) vs (V – RJ)
for the determination of Jo.

To the best of author’s knowledge, the efficiency
of CZTSSe
TFSCs is the highest efficiency obtained for an aqueous-solution-processed
CZTSSe TFSC via a modified SILAR sequence. We believe that the facile
bath-based aqueous-solution processing of the CZTSSe TFSC via a modified
SILAR sequence provides an effective pathway to fabricate a variety
of single- or multimetal absorber layers for solar-energy harvesting
without using any toxic chemicals or costly equipment.

Conclusions
In summary, a facile, green, and low-cost aqueous-solution processing
via a modified SILAR sequence for the preparation of good-quality
CZTSSe absorbers for TFSCs is presented. More specifically, the precursor
films were prepared using inexpensive metal salts as starting materials
and water as a solvent. The sequential layer-by-layer growth of the
precursor films enabled the formation of good-quality CZTSSe absorber
layers after annealing treatment under a Se vapor atmosphere. Notably,
the CZTSSe absorber layers exhibited nearly carbon-free, dense microstructures
with large grains, unlike other bath-based or direct-solution-processed
absorber layers. Our initial CZTSSe TFSC exhibited a PCE of 3.74%,
which is the highest efficiency for an aqueous-solution-processed
CZTSSe absorber layer via a modified SILAR sequence. The detailed
diode analysis elucidated that the Rs value
was mainly dominated by the absorber quality rather than the Mo(S,Se)2 layer, whereas the interface recombinations, such as the
absorber/buffer or absorber/Mo, affected the Gsh, nd, and Jo values. This suggests that a device efficiency can be further
enhanced by optimizing the preparative parameters as well as postannealing
conditions for the CZTSSe absorber layers, which are under progress.
We believe that a facile aqueous-solution processing via a modified
SILAR sequence represents a possible pathway toward the low-cost,
environmentally benign, and scalable fabrication of CZTSSe TFSCs and
can be further exploited for other single-/multimetal compounds for
solar-energy harvesting applications.

Experimental Details
Materials
All chemicals were used as received. Copper
sulfate (CuSO4·5H2O) (98%), zinc sulfate
(ZnSO4·7H2O), tin chloride (SnCl2) (98%), sodium sulfide (Na2S), and ammonium fluoride
(NH4F) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Korea. Aqueous
solutions were prepared using DI water.

Preparation of the Precursor
Films
The precursor films
were deposited onto Mo-coated soda lime glass (SLG) substrates using
a modified SILAR sequence, as described in our previous reports, with
slight modifications.25,26,28 The Mo-coated SLG substrates were ultrasonically cleaned with DI
water for 10 min prior to deposition. The solution concentrations
were optimized to 0.012 M CuSO4·5H2O, 0.5
M ZnSO4·7H2O, 0.08 M SnCl2,
and 0.16 M Na2S to deposit the Cu-poor and Zn-rich precursor
films. The deposition of the precursor films was carried out using
a modified SILAR sequence in the following manner. The first cationic
bath contained 0.012 M CuSO4·5H2O, 0.08
M SnCl2, and 0.04 M NH4F; the second cationic
bath contained 0.5 M ZnSO4·7H2O; and the
anionic bath contained 0.16 M Na2S. Thus, the process involved
the following subsequent SILAR steps for the deposition of the precursor
films: the substrate was (i) immersed in the cationic solution containing
Cu+ & Sn4+ species for 30 s, (ii) ultrasonically
rinsed with DI water for 20 s, (iii) immersed in the anionic solution
for 20 s, (iv) ultrasonically rinsed with DI water for 20 s, (v) immersed
in the cationic solution containing Zn2+ for 30 s, (vi)
ultrasonically rinsed with DI water for 20 s, (vii) immersed in the
anionic solution for 20 s, and finally (viii) ultrasonically rinsed
with DI water again for 20 s. The modified SILAR cycles were repeated
100 times in air to deposit the precursor films with thicknesses of
∼1 μm. No additional heating step at higher temperatures
was required like that in direct solution processing of the precursor
films because the precursor films in this work were prepared using
an aqueous-solution-processing technique via a modified SILAR sequence. Figure S7 shows the photograph of the SILAR system
used for the deposition of the precursor films.

Formation of
CZTS and CZTSSe Absorbers by the RTA Process
The precursor
films were annealed in an RTA furnace under S and
Se vapor atmospheres at 580 and 550 °C to form highly crystalline
CZTS and CZTSSe phases, respectively. During the annealing process,
approximately 90 mg of S for CZTS or 50–450 mg of Se for CZTSSe
were placed near the precursor in a graphite box (volume = 12.3 cm3). A working pressure of 75 mbar was adjusted by continuously
pumping Ar gas in an RTA furnace. A ramp rate of approximately 4.833
and 4.585 °C/s for CZTS and CZTSSe, respectively, and a dwell
time of 15 min were used during the annealing process. The annealed
films were further naturally cooled to room temperature. Figure S8 shows the annealing temperature profile
used for sulfurization and selenization of the precursor films.

Solar Cell Device Fabrication
A standard Mo/absorber/CdS/i-ZnO/Al-ZnO/Al
configuration was used to fabricate the solar cell devices. A detailed fabrication process of a full-device
structure can be found in our previous reports.37,38

Characterization
FE-SEM (model Hitachi S 4800, Japan)
equipped with EDS was used to examine the morphology of the films
before and after the annealing process at the Korean Basic Science
Institute (KBSI), Gwangju, South Korea. Quantitative analyses of the
elemental compositions of the annealed films were conducted using
XRF spectroscopy (ZSX Primus II Rigaku Corp.). The phases and crystal
structures of the films were characterized by high-resolution XRD
(X’Pert PRO, Philips, Eindhoven, Netherlands) operated at 40
kV and 30 mA. Raman spectroscopy (LabRAM HR8000 UV, HORIBA Jobin Yvon,
France) equipped with a 532 nm laser was used to verify the phase
purities of the films. The oxidation states of each element in the
annealed films were examined using high-resolution X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (VG MultiLab 2000, Thermo VG Scientific, UK) at room
temperature. The device efficiency of the fabricated TFSCs was measured
by using a class AAA solar simulator (Sol31, Oriel, USA). An EQE was
characterized using an incident PCE measurement unit (PV Measurements,
Inc., USA) at the Korea Institute of Industrial Technology (KITECH),
Cheonan, South Korea. A high-speed, high-precision OKL-HSSR-1500N
spectroradiometer was used to calibrate the solar simulator.
