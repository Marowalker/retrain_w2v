Cs–Ce–Zr
catalysts with various weight ratios are
prepared by the sol–gel method in this paper. The main crystalline
phases were identified by X-ray diffraction. The activities of catalysts
during soot combustion were tested by thermogravimetric and differential
scanning calorimetry. The contact conditions of soot/catalysts (sintered
at 450 and 380 °C, respectively, under loose and tight contact
conditions) were observed by scanning electron microscopy to study
the effect of contact conditions on catalytic activity, and it was
determined that the catalytic activities under tight contact conditions
are superior to those under loose contact conditions. However, the
soot oxidation rate speeds up after the peak temperature of about
450 °C under loose contact conditions, which is due to the fact
that the contact condition is enhanced by melting CsNO3. The soot onset ignition temperature is lower for the catalysts
with more Cs content under loose contact conditions. The minimum gaps
of the soot onset ignition temperature and soot oxidation rates under
the two contact conditions are 32 and 7 °C, which shows that
the gap of catalytic activities under the respective contact conditions
can be decreased by the formation of different crystalline phases.

Introduction
Soot particulates discharged by diesel
engines have caused serious
pollution. The use of diesel particulate filters (DPFs) seems a better
way to solve the pollution problem. To assure the regeneration of
DPFs, a potentially useful catalyst has to operate efficiently at
low temperatures because the temperature of typical exhausts is 400
°C or below in light-duty applications.1 Also, the contact condition between soot and catalysts is a major
factor which lowers the catalytic activity of catalysts. CexZr1–xO catalysts
have been applied widely in three-way catalysts for gasoline engines.
The popularity of CeO2 is mostly due to its number of effective
redox Ce4+/Ce3+ sites and its ability to exchange
oxygen. The oxygen vacancy in CeO2 due to many Ce4+/Ce3+ redox sites can be rapidly formed and removed, which
results in its remarkable oxygen storage capacity.2−4 The substitution
of Ce by Zr is considered a modification of the reduction of Ce4+ and the mobility of lattice oxygen.5 Ceria nanofibers were synthesized as soot oxidation catalysts, which
can reduce the peak combustion temperature from 600 °C (noncatalytic
combustion) to 375 °C in tight contact and 553 °C in loose
contact.6 CexZr1–xO2 had been prepared
by the sol–gel method and shifting the combustion temperature
(Tm) from 622 to 547 °C (loose contact)
or 404 °C (tight contact).7 CuO/ceria–zirconia
catalysts have been prepared and display a very high activity (54%
at 348 °C).8 The effects of Nd doping
on the physicochemical and catalytic properties for soot combustion
of CeO2 and CeO2–ZrO2 oxides
have been studied.9 Three-dimensionally
ordered macroporous Ce1–xZrxO2-supported gold nanoparticle
catalysts were successfully synthesized by the gas bubbling-assisted
membrane reduction method.10 A series of
ceria and ceria–zirconia catalysts with varying compositions
and surface areas have been systematically investigated in the oxidation
of soot in the temperature range of 600 K < T <
800 K.11 K–Ce–Zr had been
prepared and showed good catalytic activity for soot oxidation under
loose contact conditions.12 In the case
of soot oxidation, the first role of alkali is to reinforce the contact
between soot particles and the catalyst surface since this parameter
is known as a critical step in soot oxidation reactions.13−16 According to the relative study, the order of reactivity of alkaline
for soot oxidation is: Cs > K > Na.17 Some
catalysts containing Cs for soot combustion have been studied, including
the Cs–Cu/ZrO2 system,18 Csx–M0.1/ZrO2 catalysts (M = Cu or Co),19 Cs–MnOx–CeO2 catalysts,20 Cs2SO4·V2O5 catalysts,21 and so forth.
The Cs–Ce–Zr catalysts had been prepared by the sol–gel
method, and the effects of contact conditions between soot and catalysts
on soot catalytic combustion have been discussed in this paper.

Results
and Discussion
Powder X-ray Diffraction (XRD) Analysis
XRD patterns
of Cs–Ce–Zr catalysts with different weight ratios have
been presented in Figure 1. The main crystalline phases are listed in Table 1. It can be seen that the main
crystalline phases are CsNO3, Zr0.4Ce0.6O2, and Cs4ZrO4 for sample 1. Sample
2 has three crystalline phases of CsNO3, Zr0.5Ce0.5O2, and Cs4ZrO4.
There are three identical phases of CsNO3, Cs4ZrO4, and CeO2 for sample 3, sample 4, and
sample 5. The distinct phases are Zr0.5Ce0.5O2, Zr0.4Ce0.6O2, and
Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 for above three catalysts.
Sample 6 contains Cs4ZrO4, CsNO3,
and Zr0.84Ce0.16O2. The same phase
Zr0.5Ce0.5O2 is presented when sample
2 and sample 3 are with an identical Ce–Zr molar ratio of 1:1.
This illustrates that the formation of cerium zirconium compounds
is not affected by the Cs content. Sample 1 and sample 4 with the
same Ce–Zr molar ratio of 2:1 presented the same phase Zr0.4Ce0.6O2. However, sample 5 with a
molar ratio of 3:2:1 contains the different phase Ce0.75Zr0.25O2. This illustrates that the cerium
zirconium compounds will be affected when the Cs content is beyond
a certain value. All six catalysts contain CsNO3.

Thermogravimetric and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (TG–DSC)
Analysis
The TG–DSC curves of the Cs–Ce–Zr
catalysts and soot under loose contact conditions have been shown
in Figure 2, and their
parameters of catalytic activity are shown in Table 2. It can be seen from Figure 2 and Table 2 that sample 5 and sample 6 have the lowest soot onset
ignition temperature of 345 °C, and their soot oxidation rates
are the slowest among the six catalysts. To is 350 °C for sample 3, which is lower among the six catalysts.
It can be seen from Table 2 that the lower To may be caused
by the higher Cs content of 53.61, 51.80, and 55.3% for sample 3,
sample 5, and sample 6. Sample 4 has the fastest soot oxidation rate,
but its soot onset ignition temperature is higher. To is similar and ΔT has a gap of
10 °C for sample 1 and sample 4, which shows that the appearance
of Cs4ZrO4 and CeO2 for sample 4
has less effect on catalytic activity. Soot onset ignition is lowered
14 °C and the soot oxidation rate is slowed 10 °C for sample
3 than those of sample 1. It can be seen from Table 1 that sample 2 and sample 3 have three same
phases of CsNO3, Zr0.5Ce0.5O2, and Cs4ZrO4, but only sample 3 possesses
CeO2. It can be seen from Tables 1 and 2 that formations
of cerium zirconium compounds have little effect on catalytic activity
of the six catalysts under loose contact conditions. The catalysts
have the optimum catalytic activity when the catalysts have the proper
ratios of Cs–Ce–Zr.

TG–DSC
curves of the Cs–Ce–Zr catalysts and
soot mixtures under tight contact mode have been presented in Figure 3. It can be seen
from Figures 2 and 3 that there are small weight losses on TG curves
between 100 and 200 °C, for which no corresponding peaks are
shown on DSC curves. Also, it can be seen that the weight loss is
increased when the catalysts contain more Cs content. As can be seen
from Table 1, all the
crystalline phases are very stable below 200 °C, so the weight
loss cannot be due to the decomposition of the main crystalline phases.
CsNO3 can absorb moisture in air, and the catalysts containing
CsNO3 may absorb CO2 in air. Therefore, it can
be concluded that the weight loss may be due to the volatilization
of physical adsorption of water or desorption of CO2 adsorbed
on the surface of catalysts. The parameters of catalytic activity
for the Cs–Ce–Zr catalysts with soot under tight contact
conditions have been shown in Table 3. Comparing Table 2 with Table 3, To is lowered and the soot oxidation
rate is quickened obviously for a majority of catalysts under tight
contact conditions than under loose contact conditions. It can be
seen from Figure 3 and Table 3 that sample 5 has
the lowest To of 294 °C among the
six catalysts under tight contact conditions, which is lowered 51
°C than under loose contact conditions. Sample 2 has the highest To of 332 °C among the six catalysts. Sample
6 has the fastest soot oxidation rate under tight contact conditions,
which is quickened 41 °C than under loose contact conditions.
Sample 1 has the slowest soot oxidation rate under tight contact conditions,
which is similar under loose contact conditions. This illustrates
that the soot oxidation rate is not affected by contact mode under
cooperation of CsNO3 and Zr0.4Ce0.6O2. Sample 1 has To similar
to sample 4 under tight contact conditions, which shows that cooperation
of CsNO3 and Zr0.4Ce0.6O2 is similar with CsNO3, Zr0.4Ce0.6O2, Cs4ZrO4, and CeO2 on lowering To. The soot oxidation rate
is the gap of 15 °C under CsNO3, Zr0.4Ce0.6O2, Cs4ZrO4, and CeO2 compared to CsNO3 and Zr0.4Ce0.6O2. The gap is not large. Sample 2 has a soot oxidation
rate similar to sample 3. However, To has
a gap of 14 °C, which shows that more Cs content and appearance
of CeO2 has little effect on catalytic activity under tight
contact conditions. Under CsNO3 and Zr0.4Ce0.6O2 for sample 1, CsNO3, Zr0.4Ce0.6O2, Cs4ZrO4, and
CeO2 for sample 4, and CsNO3, Ce0.75Zr0.25O2, Cs4ZrO4, and
CeO2 for sample 5, To is lowered
over 50 °C under tight contact conditions rather than under loose
contact conditions. To is lowered over
30 °C under tight contact conditions rather than under loose
contact conditions under CsNO3, Zr0.5Ce0.5O2, and Cs4ZrO4 for sample
2, CsNO3, Zr0.5Ce0.5O2, Cs4ZrO4, and CeO2 for sample 3,
and CsNO3, Zr0.84Ce0.16O2, and Cs4ZrO4 for sample 6. Soot oxidation
is not affected nearly as much by contact mode under CsNO3 and Zr0.4Ce0.6O2 for sample 1.
Soot oxidation is affected slightly under CsNO3, Zr0.4Ce0.6O2, Cs4ZrO4, and CeO2, and the gap of ΔT is
only 12 °C for sample 4 under the two contact modes. The gap
of ΔT is 19 °C under CsNO3,
Zr0.5Ce0.5O2, and Cs4ZrO4 for sample 2 under the two contact modes. The gap of ΔT is 35 °C under CsNO3, Zr0.5Ce0.5O2, Cs4ZrO4, and
CeO2 for sample 3 and 32 °C under CsNO3, Ce0.75Zr0.25O2, Cs4ZrO4, and CeO2 for sample 5 under the two contact
modes. The gap is 41 °C under CsNO3, Zr0.84Ce0.16O2, and Cs4ZrO4 for sample 6 under the two contact modes. The orders of crystalline
phases which To is affected by contact
mode from small to large are as follows: CsNO3 + Zr0.5Ce0.5O2 + Cs4ZrO4 (sample 2) ≈ CsNO3 + Zr0.5Ce0.5O2 + Cs4ZrO4 + CeO2 (sample3)
≈ CsNO3 + Zr0.84Ce0.16O2 + Cs4ZrO4 (sample 6) < CsNO3 + Zr0.4Ce0.6O2 (sample 1)
≈ CsNO3 + Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 + Cs4ZrO4 + CeO2 (sample
5) < CsNO3 + Zr0.4Ce0.6O2 + Cs4ZrO4 + CeO2 (sample 4).

Scanning Electron
Microscopy (SEM) Analysis
Figure 4 shows the morphology
of the soot particulates. As can be seen from this figure, the soot
particles have a particle size of about 50 nm in diameter and agglomerate
together. The morphology of soot particles is close to sphere shape.

Figure 4 SEM images
of pure soot particles.

The SEM images of sample 1 and soot mixtures under two different
contact conditions have been presented in Figure 5. It can be seen from Figure 5a that soot agglomerate together and the
surfaces of some catalysts are not covered by soot when catalysts/soot
are under loose contact conditions. However, Figure 5b shows that only gathered soot can be seen,
which illustrates that catalysts have been covered fully by soot.

mode and (b) under tight contact mode.

The SEM images of Cs–Ce–Zr catalysts and soot
mixtures
under loose contact conditions sintered at 450 °C have been presented
in Figure 6a,c,e,g,i,k,
which show that soot cannot be seen nearly and the surface of catalysts
have become visible clearly. Figure 6b,d,f,h,j,l presented the SEM images of catalysts and
soot mixtures under tight contact conditions sintered at 380 °C,
which can be seen that there is still some soot left over the surface
of catalysts. It can be seen from Figure 2 and Table 2 that Tp is about 450 °C
for the six catalysts with soot under loose contact conditions. It
can be seen that the difference value of Te and Tp is about 33–49 °C
and that the difference value of Tp and To is about 78–107 °C, which shows
that the soot combustion rate is quickened obviously after Tp. The melting temperature of CsNO3 is 414 °C, and thus, the melting CsNO3 can enhance
the contact between soot and catalysts after 414 °C. Because
catalysts and soot under loose contact conditions are sintered at
450 °C, which exceeds the melting temperature of CsNO3. The soot combustion rate is fast under the action of melting CsNO3, so very little soot remains on the surface of catalysts.
There may be some residue soot integrated with melting CsNO3, so the remnant soot is not seen in Figure 6. Figure 3 and Table 3 show that the peak temperature of soot combustion is about
380 °C under tight contact conditions. It can be seen that the
difference value of Te and Tp is about 73–102 °C and that the difference
value of Tp and To is about 58–81 °C, which shows that the soot
combustion rate is slowed after Tp. The
catalysts and soot mixtures under tight contact conditions sintered
at 380 °C, at which CsNO3 does not melt. Therefore,
it can be seen from Figure 6b,d,f,h,j,l that there is a part of the soot remaining on
the surface of catalysts. It can be seen that the role of unmelted
CsNO3 is very important at lowering the soot onset ignition
temperature under tight contact conditions, but the effect on quickening
the soot oxidation rate is not obvious.

Conclusions
The
Cs–Ce–Zr catalysts with different weight ratios
have been prepared by the sol–gel method. The compositions
and catalytic activity have been studied. In addition, the effects
of catalysts/soot contact conditions on catalytic activity have been
researched. The soot onset ignition temperature is lowered, and the
soot oxidation rate is quicker under tight contact conditions than
that under loose contact conditions. The soot onset ignition temperature
for the catalyst with 51.80% Cs content is 294 °C under tight
contact conditions, which is lowered about 50 °C when compared
with that of loose contact conditions. Soot oxidation for the catalyst
with 55.30% Cs content is quickened about 40 °C under tight contact
conditions when compared with that under loose contact conditions.
The soot onset ignition temperature is affected slightly by contact
mode under the cooperation of CsNO3–Zr0.5Ce0.5O2–Cs4ZrO4. Also, the soot oxidation rate is not affected nearly as much by
contact mode under cooperation of CsNO3–Zr0.4Ce0.6O2. Soot oxidation can be sped up when
the temperature exceeds the melting temperature of CsNO3. Because the melting CsNO3 can enhance the contact between
soot and catalysts, the soot oxidation is accelerated obviously after
414 °C. The formations of different cerium zirconium compounds
have little effect on catalytic activity. The catalytic activities
depend on mainly the relative content of Cs–Ce–Zr.

Experimental
Section
Catalyst Preparation
The analytical pure CsNO3, Ce(NO3)3·6H2O, and Zr(NO3)4·5H2O were applied in this paper.
The Cs–Ce–Zr catalysts with different weight ratios
have been prepared by the sol–gel method. The theoretical compositions
of the Cs–Ce–Zr catalysts are shown in Table 4. The analytical pure CsNO3, Ce(NO3)3·6H2O, and
Zr(NO3)4·5H2O with different
molar ratios were dissolved in water, and the solutions were agitated
at 80 °C via electromagnetic stirring, and a certain amount of
citric acid and polyethylene glycol were added to the solution until
the sols were formed. The sols were sealed and aged to form gels.
The gels were dried at 120 °C for 4 h. At last, the dried catalyst
samples were ground in an agate mortar, and then the samples were
calcined at 600 °C for 2 h.

Catalytic
Oxidation Activity Characterization
TG–DSC
(STA 449C, NETZSCH, Germany) was used to characterize the catalytic
activity of the prepared catalysts. The catalysts and soot were mixed
in two modes to obtain the samples used in TG–DSC analysis.
The loose contact mode samples were prepared as follows: the catalysts
and soot were mixed and shaken gently to make the catalysts and soot
mix in a uniform manner. The catalysts and soot were mixed and ground
in an agate mortar to achieve the other kind of samples with tight
contact mode used in TG–DSC testing. The soot used in the TG–DSC
experiment was collected using glassware above the burning diesel
oil. The thermal analyses were carried out at a heating rate of 10
°C/min from room temperature to 600 °C in air. CO2 was released when the soot was oxidized under the action of the
catalysts, so the weight loss would be presented on TG curves. The
beginning temperature of weight loss To is defined as the soot onset ignition temperature. Tp is the peak temperature on DSC curves, which represents
the maximum reaction rate of soot. Te is
the temperature at which the loss weight was ended on TG curves. 1  

Hence, To and ΔT were used to assess the
catalytic
activities of the catalysts. Less ΔT means
that the soot oxidation occurs in a more rapid manner.

Catalyst Structure
Characterization
Crystalline phases
of the catalyst materials were identified by XRD (Rigaku D/max-rA,
Rigaku, Japan) equipped with a Cu Kα radiation source. The contact
condition between the soot and catalysts was observed by SEM (JSM-6700,
JEOL Ltd. Japan). The samples for SEM had been prepared by mixing
the catalysts and soot at a ratio of 3:1 under loose contact mode
and tight contact mode. One sample was observed directly by SEM, and
the other samples were placed at a furnace and heated to the 380 °C
(under tight contact mode) and 450 °C (under loose contact mode)
and then cooled to room temperature and observed by SEM.
