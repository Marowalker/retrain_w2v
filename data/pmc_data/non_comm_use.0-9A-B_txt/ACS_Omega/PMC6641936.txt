The development of a green and sustainable
synthetic methodology
still remains a challenge across the globe. Encouraging the prevailing
challenge, herein, we have synthesized Pd nanoparticles (Pd NPs) in
a green and environmentally viable route, using the extract of waste
papaya peel without the assistance of any reducing agents, high-temperature
calcination, and reduction procedures. The biomolecules present in
the waste papaya peel extract reduced Pd(II) to nanosize Pd(0) in
a one-pot green and sustainable process. As a catalyst, the new Pd
NPs offer a simple and efficient methodology in direct Suzuki–Miyaura
and Sonogashira coupling with excellent yields under mild reaction
conditions.

Introduction
Transition metals,
on account of their unique bonding properties
and reaction mechanism, provide newer opportunities for synthetic
application as a catalyst.1,2 In this regard, palladium
continues to attract great interest because of its versatility as
a catalyst that mediates various C–C bond-forming reactions.3−11 Among them, Suzuki–Miyaura12−15 and Sonogashira16−20 cross-coupling reactions are reliable and powerful methods for the
synthesis of biaryl21−24 and acetylenyl25−27 derivatives which are ubiquitous features in numerous
biologically active compounds. They have a vast application potential
as a key synthetic precursor for the construction of pharmaceuticals,
fine chemicals, agrochemicals, natural products, and smart engineering
materials, including conducting polymers and molecular wires.28−32 Consequently, there is a need to design a highly efficient, cost-effective,
simple, commercially viable, and environmentally friendly methods
for the synthesis of biaryl and acetylenyl derivatives. Nowadays,
metal nanoparticles (NPs) have received particular interest in a wide
range of research fields because of their fabulous ability as a nanocatalyst
and connecting the homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis.33

These features invariably attract the
researchers to use NPs in
catalysis. Usually metal NPs are prepared by different chemical, physical,
and biological methods.34 Conventional
NP synthesis methods involve the usage of toxic chemicals, formation
of hazardous by-products, and contamination from precursor chemicals.
Therefore, development of clean, nontoxic, and environment-friendly
procedures for NP synthesis is needed. In this aspect, biological
techniques have several advantages over physical and chemical methods.
It involves the use of environment-friendly green chemistry-based
approach that employs microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, algae, and
yeast) and plants.35 In comparison to the
rate of reduction of metal ions with microorganisms, plant extract
is found to be more effective.36 However,
the use of plant resources for NP synthesis brings up significant
drawback, leading to the destruction of ecologically important plants
and plant parts. As such, in order to avoid this and to serve the
purpose of pollution mitigation, use of agrowaste is amenable, which
is otherwise a significant source of pollution and creates waste management
issues. The use of various agrowastes for the synthesis of NPs is
an attractive platform in last few decades. Moreover, nowadays, use
of agricultural waste such as peel extract for the production of cellulose
nanofibers is a widely accepted technology.37,38

Papaya (Carica papaya L, family:
Caricaceae) is one of the most common fruits disseminated throughout
the world. Papaya juice has a wide range of purported medicinal properties
for the treatment of various diseases. In industry, the processing
of this fruit, as well as its fresh consumption, results about 20–25%
of waste, such as peels and seeds which are abundant natural waste
materials across the world.39 Waste utilization
from food processing industries is highly essential and challenging
task all around the globe.37,38 As such, new aspects
toward recyclability of the waste by-products in organic synthesis
should be encouraged by the researchers from the point of environmental
issues. Keeping this in mind, herein, we have synthesized Pd NPs in
an eco-friendly manner by using the water extract of fresh peel of
papaya fruits at room temperature without using any reducing agent
(Figure 1). Use of
papaya peel waste (vegetable peel) without conventional treatments
fulfilling special requirement of pH, temperature, and rigorous experimental
setup is a new route for the Pd NP synthesis. This paper was emphasized
on the generation of Pd NPs utilizing waste papaya peels, their detail
characterization, and application in ligand-free Suzuki–Miyaura
and copper- and amine-free Sonogashira reactions. Traditionally, both
the reactions are performed in volatile organic solvents. Therefore,
“greening-up” these reactions are important aspect in
synthesis. Looking upon this, we present here an effectively green
protocol by carrying out these cross-coupling reactions using this
Pd NPs as catalysts in the greener solvent as it is environmentally
and economically doable.

Figure 1 Preparation of Pd NPs from waste papaya peels.

Results and Discussion
Preparation of Pd NPs Using
Waste Papaya Peel
Our first
aim was to synthesize Pd NPs by simple replacement of synthetic reagents
with natural ones via complete utilization of the residual sources,
instead of wasteful dumping. The Pd NP was synthesized by direct mixing
of Pd(OAc)2 with aqueous extract of papaya peel at room
temperature (as provided in the Experimental Section). After 2 days, the color of the reaction mixture became black from
brown (which indicates the formation of Pd NPs). The flavin mononucleotide
and flavin adenine dinucleotide present in the papaya peel may act
as a reductant for the reduction of Pd(OAc)2.40Figure 2 is a pictorial presentation of this color change. It is noteworthy
to mention that we have followed the green chemistry protocol to synthesize
these Pd NPs without using any base, reducing agent, toxic or hazardous
reagent, and any organic solvent.

papaya extract, (b) papaya
extract + Pd(OAc)2, and (c) Pd NPs.

Characterization of Pd NPs
The Pd NPs were characterized
by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy
(SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunaur–Emmett–Teller
(BET), and UV–visible spectroscopy and used as a catalyst for
C–C coupling reactions.

The UV–visible absorption
spectroscopy is a commonly used technique to characterize various
metal NPs.41 The light wavelength between
200 and 600 nm is generally used for the characterization of Pd NPs.42 The UV spectrum (Figure 2a) shows a prominent band at 269 nm of the
papaya peel extract. Again, the absorption bands of the Pd(OAc)2 solution above 270 nm were assigned for ligand-to-metal charge-transfer
transition.43,44 Addition of papaya peel extract
into Pd2+ ion solution shows a gradual color change to
black over time (Figure 2a–c). A subsequent color change to black indicates Pd2+ reduction to zero-valent Pd as proved by the UV–visible
analysis. Figure 2b
shows the absorption spectrum of Pd(OAc)2 solution after
the addition of papaya peel extract, which indicates a distinctive
overlapping peak approximately in the same region as that of the extract.
The absorption spectrum of the suspension of Pd NPs after bioreduction
results in the appearance of a broad absorption in the region 320–450
nm after 2 days which may be due to the scattering effect of solid
Pd particles (Figure 2c).

Figure 3a shows
the powder XRD (PXRD) pattern of Pd NPs which demarcate the formation
of the face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice system of the palladium nanostructure
(JCPDS card no. 89-4897). The observed peaks of Pd at 2θ = 39.9,
46.4, and 67.1° correspond to (111), (200), and (220) reflections,
respectively, along with two additional diffraction peaks of PdO (JCPDS
card no. 75-0200) at 2θ = 29.8 and 55° for (100) and (112)
reflections, respectively. Figure 3b shows the energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) pattern of
the sample which confirmed the existence of Pd and O. Thus, XRD and
EDX analyses confirm the formation of Pd/PdO. Pd(0) initially formed
might have transformed to PdO via aerial oxidation as reported earlier.45

Figure 3 (a) PXRD pattern, (b) EDX pattern, and (c,d) SEM images
of Pd NPs.

SEM was employed to characterize
the morphology and surface topography
of the Pd NPs. It is observed that small aggregates of Pd NPs are
self-oriented in forming bigger particles with some porous features.
In Figure 3d, the SEM
image of Pd NPs is encircled to demarcate the porous features which
were further confirmed by pore size distribution analyses (by the
Barrett–Joyner–Halenda method). Further TEM studies
were performed to understand the exposed crystal planes with definite
interplaner spacing. Figure 4a presents the global TEM image of prepared Pd NPs. It could
be observed that highly crystalline spherical Pd NPs are which ranges
1–5 nm in size. The distribution of the synthesized Pd NPs
(from Figure 4a) was
analyzed using Gaussian fits and presented in Figure 4b in the form of histogram.

Figure 4 (a) TEM image, (b) Pd
NP distribution, and (c,d) HRTEM images of
Pd NPs.

As shown in Figure 4b, ca. 80% of the Pd NPs size falls in 1–3
nm with a mean
size of 2.4 nm. Figure 4c,d confirms the presence of crystal planes with the lattice spacings
of 0.22 and 0.19 nm which are consistent with interplaner spacing
{111} and {200} lattice planes of fcc Pd NPs. The corresponding selected-area
electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of Pd NPs is presented in Figure 4c (inset) which possesses
five well-resolved rings corresponding to fcc. The ring originated
is ascribed to the crystallographic planes (111), (200), (220), (311)
and (222) of fcc Pd NPs. There is a good match between the calculated d-values and the d-values obtained from
standard JCPDS data. Thus, XRD and high-resolution transmission electron
microscopy (HRTEM) (including SAED) studies evidently establish the
crystalline nature of Pd NPs. The specific surface area was determined
by N2 physisorption using the BET method and is presented
in Figure 5 along with
pore size distribution. The isotherm produced is of type IV isotherm
with H3 hysteresis loop with upper closure point P/Po ≥ 0.9 which are demarcated
as a characteristic of the mesoporous material. Additionally, the
specific surface area as calculated by the BET equation was about
18.2 m2/g with a pore diameter of 3.7 nm. Moreover, the
pore size distribution curve (inset) also indicates the mesoporosity
of the Pd NPs.

and
(b) pore size distribution of Pd NPs.

Catalytic Activity of Pd NPs
The efficiency of these
Pd NPs is initially assessed in the reaction of 4-methoxybromobenzene
(1 mmol) and phenylboronic acid (1.2 mmol) using different bases in
H2O at room temperature (Table 1), and K2CO3 was found
to be the most effective base (Table 1, entries 1–8). In addition, we have also performed
the reaction in different solvents such as EtOH, i-PrOH, CH3CN, and H2O/EtOH (1:1). Interestingly,
the use of H2O/EtOH (1:1) as a solvent gave the desired
product within shorter reaction time (Table 1, entry 13). As illustrated in Table 1, 0.0009 mmol catalyst was sufficient
to obtain 95% yield of the product in both H2O and aqueous
ethanol (Table 1, entries
12 and 13) and the reaction did not proceed without catalyst (Table 1, entry 14).

b Isolated yields.

A survey of the literature revealed that there are only few reports
with excellent efficiencies on the application of pure H2O as a solvent in Suzuki–Miyaura reaction.46 Therefore, considering the optimized conditions as discussed
in Table 1, we have
performed a comparative study for electronically diverse aryl bromides
and arylboronic acids in H2O (method A) and 1:1 ratio of
H2O and EtOH (method B) (Table 2). The reactions of electron-rich aryl bromides
are more efficient than (Table 2, entries 4–7 & 9–12) that of electron-poor
aryl bromides (Table 2, entries 13–22) in H2O (method A). Nitro, formyl,
and acetyl substituent aryl bromides require extended reaction time
in H2O. Insolubility of these substrates in H2O may delay the reaction process which can be overcome by using H2O/EtOH (1:1) as a reaction medium (method B) (Table 2, entries 16, 19–22).
Interestingly, increase of reaction temperature to 80 °C gave
better result within shorter reaction time in H2O (method
A) (Table 2, entries
14 & 15). Again, sterically demanding substrates such as 2-methoxyarylbromide
affects the C–X activation and affords significantly low yield
even with longer reaction time in comparison to 4-methoxyarylbromides
(Table 2, entries 4
vs 8). It can be observed from Table 2 that there are no such significant differences in
yield and duration for diverse range of arylboronic acids. However,
only poor yield of the cross-coupling product was obtained with aryl
chlorides as a coupling partner even with prolong reaction time and
high temperature. Even use of different solvents such as dimethylformamide
(DMF) and acetonitrile did not improve the yield (Table 2, entries 23–25).

Next, these prepared Pd NPs were employed as a catalyst
for Sonogashira
reaction.47−59 Generally, Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction is carried out with
a Pd source as a catalyst in the presence of Cu source as a cocatalyst
using amine as the reaction medium. Usually, the presence of copper
salt led to the formation of Glaser-type coupling. Therefore, we began
our experiment using these Pd NPs as a catalyst without using any
ligand and copper salt.

For that purpose, 4-nitro-iodobenzene
and phenylacetylene were
chosen as the model substrates. The reaction conditions were standardized
by varying catalyst amount, temperature, and using different bases
and solvents (Table 3). Initially, we were able to isolate very little amount of cross-coupling
product in H2O at ambient temperature even with higher
catalyst loading (Table 3, entries 1 and 2). However, the use of alcoholic solvents such as
ethanol and isopropanol gave better result (Table 3, entries 3 and 4). Using H2O
as a cosolvent (ethanol/H2O 1:1), we obtained a reduced
amount of the cross-coupled product (Table 3, entry 5). Other solvents such as toluene,
dioxane, THF, and 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) did not show any positive
impact (Table 3, entries
6, 7, and 8). The catalyst showed best performance in ethanol at 60
°C (Table 3, entry
9). The influence of unlike bases was also examined in ethanol at
60 °C. Hydroxide bases NaOH and KOH and organic base Et3N were found to be less effective. In contrast, carbonate bases such
as Na2CO3, K2CO3, and
Cs2CO3 provide excellent yield (Table 3, entries 9–11). By varying
the catalyst loading, we found that 0.02 mmol Pd NPs was sufficient
for this reaction (Table 3, entry 16).

Electronically diverse aryl
halides and terminal alkynes can be
used as substrates under this optimized reaction conditions (Table 4). Iodobenzene reacts
with terminal alkynes, delivering good to excellent yields of the
products. Even less reactive substrates such as 1-hexyne gave excellent
yield of the product (Table 4, entry 3). Additionally, both electron-poor and electron-rich
p-substituted aryl iodides afforded the coupling products in excellent
yields (Table 4 entries
5, 8, and 10). However, it is observed that with 4-iodotoluene, the
reaction completed within shorter reaction time compared to 4-iodonitrobenzene
(Table 4, entry 5 vs
8).

Similar
results were observed with metasubstituted aryl iodides
(Table 4, entries 6
and 9), with 3-iodotoluene being more competent than 3-nitro-iodobenzene.
However, a steric effect as in 2-nitro-iodobenzene relatively lowered
the reaction yield (Table 4, entry 7). Notably, coupling of electron-donating 4-iodoanisole
and 4-iodoaniline with phenylacetylene gives slightly lower yields
(Table 4, entries 15
and 16). Next, we checked the effectiveness of this reaction process
with electronically varied aromatic and aliphatic alkynes (Table 4, entries 2–4
and 10–14). Comparable yield was isolated with phenylacetylene
and 4-tolylphenyl-acetylene (Table 4, entry 10). Moderate yields were obtained when aliphatic
acetylenes were used as coupling partners. Iodobenzene shows better
reactivity with the range of aliphatic alkynes (Table 4, entries 2–4). However, in the reaction
between aryl bromides and terminal acetylene, very low product formation
was observed. Hence, we performed the reaction at 80 °C keeping
the other parameters same, and to our delight, excellent yields were
observed. In case of electron-rich aryl bromide gave better (Table 4, entries 18 and 19)
compared to electron-poor aryl bromide. For example, the reaction
between 4-bromonitrobenzene and phenylacetylene failed to complete,
rendering only 60% yield (Table 4, entry 20).

The recyclability of a catalyst
is an important aspect from the
green chemistry point of view. The recycling test was done for both
Suzuki and Sonogashira reactions (Figure 6), and we have observed that the catalyst
can be reused up to four cycles for both the reactions.

Figure 6 Reusability
of Pd NPs for coupling reactions.

In our previous work,60 we have
reported
the use of water extract of waste papaya bark ash and ethanol for
the in situ generation of Pd NPs. The water extract of waste papaya
bark ash was basic in nature, and we were able to carry out the cross-coupling
reaction without using additional base. The size of the Pd(0) NP was
10–20 nm compared to 2–4 nm found under the current
reaction protocol. The current Pd(0) NPs show the advantage in terms
of reaction time and yield compared to the previous one.60 A comparison of the effectiveness of the current
Pd(0) NP and some reported catalysts for Suzuki and Sonogashira cross-coupling
reactions is listed in Table 5. The present catalyst has the advantage of milder reaction
conditions, aqueous solvent, ligand- and additive-free conditions,
and use of natural feedstock.

Conclusions
A
green and economical method for the synthesis of Pd NPs using
the waste papaya peel extract which prioritize the utilization of
waste is developed. We have synthesized this Pd NPs from inexpensive
starting materials without using any reducing and capping reagents
in H2O at room temperature. This catalytic system was suitable
for Suzuki–Miyaura reaction at ambient temperature in H2O and for ligand-, copper-, and amine-free Sonogashira reaction.
This method is a green and economical alternative for the synthesis
of biaryl and acetylenyl derivatives because the transformation can
be affected under an aerobic atmosphere without the need for any ligand.
The current method is associated with reduced waste, materials, hazards,
risk, energy, and cost over many of the previously published procedures.

Experimental
Section
General Information
In this experiment, the chemicals
were used without further drying or purification. The UV–visible
spectra were observed by a UV–visible spectrophotometer, (Shimadzu
Corporation, UV-2550). The XRD patterns were measured with the help
of a Rigaku MultiFlex instrument using a nickel-filtered Cu Kα
(0.15418 nm) radiation source. The SEM analyses were recorded on using
a “JEOL (JSM model 6390 LV”) scanning electron microscope,
operating at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. The elemental composition
of the catalyst was confirmed through EDX analyses (the same instrument
attached with a scanning electron microscope). The particle size distribution
was characterized by a TEM instrument (model: JEOL JEM-2010).66 The surface area and pore size distribution
were analyzed by BET analysis. 1H and 13C spectra
were recorded in CDCl3 using tetramethylsilane as an internal
standard on a JEOL, JNM ECS NMR spectrometer operating at 400 MHz.
Reaction products were confirmed by comparing the 1H and 13C NMR spectra (in the Supporting Information).12

Catalyst Preparation
Preparation
of Pd NPs
Papaya peel (10 g) was washed
with distilled H2O, finely chopped, and then mixed with
100 mL of distilled H2O. The extract was filtered through
a sintered glass crucible. In a 5 mL round-bottom flask, 2 mL of the
aqueous extract was mixed with 0.1 g of Pd(OAc)2 and stirred
for 48 h at room temperature under nitrogen atmosphere. The resulting
Pd NPs were separated through centrifugation, and the black products
were dried under vacuum.

General Information about Catalytic Experiments
Suzuki–Miyaura
and Sonogashira reactions were carried out under aerobic condition,
and the progress of the reactions was monitored by aluminum-coated
TLC plates (Merck silica gel 60F254) and visualized under
a UV lamp. The isolation of desired products was achieved by a column
chromatographic technique using a silica gel (60–120 mesh).
The isolated products were identified by comparing their 1H and 13C NMR spectra as providing in the Supporting Information.

Typical Procedure for Suzuki–Miyaura
Reaction of Aryl
Halides Using Pd NPs
Aryl halide (0.5 mmol), arylboronic
acid (0.6 mmol), K2CO3 (1.5 mmol), catalyst
(0.0009 mmol), and distilled H2O (3 mL) were taken in a
25 mL round-bottom flask. The reactants were stirred at room temperature
for the required time. After completion (vide TLC), the catalyst was
separated from the reaction mixture by centrifugation and the crude
reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 10 mL).
The resultant organic phases was washed with brine (2 × 10 mL)
and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered, and
evaporated under reduced pressure, and purified by column chromatography
using ethyl acetate and hexane as an eluent. The products were characterized
by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic analyses.

For recycling experiments, the residue catalyst after centrifugation
was washed four times with excess water and ethyl acetate in sequence.
The resultant catalyst was dried under vacuum and subjected to consequent
run.

Typical Procedure for Sonogashira Cross-Coupling Reactions Using
Pd NPs
Aryl halide (1 mmol), terminal acetylene (1.5 mmol),
base (1.5 mmol), catalyst (0.02 mmol), and ethanol (3 mL) were taken
in a 25 mL round-bottom flask. The reactants were stirred at 60 °C
under aerobic condition. After completion (vide TLC), the catalyst
was separated from the reaction mixture by centrifugation and the
crude reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 ×
10 mL) and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. The
products were purified by column chromatography using hexane and ethyl
acetate as an eluent. The products were identified by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic analyses.

For recycling
experiments of Sonogashira reaction, a procedure similar to that of
Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reaction was followed.
