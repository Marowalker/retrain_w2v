The
use of salt- or macro-sized NPK fertilizers is typically associated
with low nutrient use efficiency and water eutrophication. Nanotechnology
can overcome such drawbacks, but its practical application on a large
scale is limited by (i) high costs and difficult scale-up of nanoparticle
synthesis, (ii) questionable advantages over traditional methods,
and (iii) health hazards related to nanomaterial introduction in the
food stream and the environment. Here, we report on a novel biocompatible
and multifunctional P nanofertilizer obtained by self-assembling natural
or synthetic humic substances and hydroxyapatite nanoparticles using
a simple and straightforward dipping process, exploiting the interaction
between the polyphenolic groups of humic substances and the surface
of nanohydroxyapatite. Pot tests using the as-prepared materials were
performed on Zea mays as a model crop,
and the results were compared to those obtained using commercial fused
superphosphate and bare nanohydroxyapatites. A significant improvement,
in terms of early plant growth, corn productivity, rhizosphere bacteria,
and the resistance to NaCl-induced abiotic stresses, was achieved
using hydroxyapatite nanoparticles assembled with humic substances.
These effects were ascribed to the synergistic co-release of phosphate
ions and humic substances, which are two types of plant-beneficial
agents for crop nutrition and stimulation, respectively. The release
patterns were proven to be tunable with the amount of humic substances
adsorbed on the nanoparticles, inducing competition between humic-substance-driven
phosphorous dissolution and block of water contact. Such positive
effects on plant growth in association with its intrinsic biocompatibility,
simple synthesis, and multifunctionality qualify this novel nanofertilizer
as a promising material for large-scale use in the agronomic field.

==== Body
Introduction
Since the last few
decades, the agricultural lands utilized for
intensive and irrigated farming have been suffering from several anthropogenic
factors including the overuse of chemical NPK fertilizers, low crop
nutrient use efficiency (NUE), leaching of soil organic matter, and
soil salinization.1−3 These factors adversely affected crop productivity
and thus raised serious concerns due to competing demands for food
to feed the ever-growing world population (projected to be 9.7 billion
by 2050).4 In this context, the development
of nanotechnology-based fertilizers for crop nutrition has been suggested
as an alternative tool to overcome the drawbacks arising from the
current agricultural practices. Much effort has been thus devoted
to design nanobased architectures for agronomical purposes. However,
there is still a concern about the intentional utilization of nanoparticles
for crop cultivation, as residual nanomaterials in crops and in the
environment will eventually increase their exposure routes, causing
possible bioaccumulation through the food chain and potential negative
effects on human health. As an example, the work by Servin et al.
has proved that nanosized TiO2 particles in soils can accumulate
into cucumber fruits, suggesting that the use of nanomaterials can
potentially lead to bioamplification toward humans.5

Due to their biocompatibility and biodegradability,
hydroxyapatite
(HA, (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2))
nanoparticles are ranked as one of the most popular candidates for
agronomical applications. Moreover, HA dissolution into calcium and
phosphate ions is very fast at low pH, indicating that stomach-acid-based
digestion could completely prevent its accumulation in human organs.6 HA nanoparticles can exploit their potential
as fertilizers in two ways: (i) as controlled release fertilizers
(CRFs) and (ii) as nanocarriers for the delivery of macro- or micronutrients.
In the first case, the action mechanism is based on the water dissolution
of HA nanoparticles, which are less soluble in aqueous media than
commercial chemical fertilizers, thus allowing for a slower and more
controlled release of P and other macro- or micronutrients in soils.
In the second case, HA nanoparticles enter inside the plant tissues,
where they can perform their action, retaining their structure or
dissolving to release P and other nutrients.

Whether they are
used as CRFs or as nanocarriers, the ability of
HA nanoparticles to efficiently deliver nutrients to crops is hindered
by their scarce mobility due to their low solubility in neutral and
alkaline soils (i.e., pH > 7.0) and by their tendency to form large
nanoparticle agglomerates, limiting their uptake by plant roots and
leaves. A viable strategy to overcome these issues and improve HA
nanoparticle bioavailability is to modify their surfaces with nontoxic
and soil-friendly materials capable of increasing HA solubility and/or
avoiding the formation of nanoparticle agglomerates. To this end,
HA surface modification with several molecules such as citric acid
and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) has been previously reported. More
specifically, surface engineering of HA nanoparticles with citric
acid has proven to be a facile way to modulate P releasing kinetics,
allowing to provide optimal concentrations of P nutrients for crops
during their growth.6 In a paper by Liu
and Lal, HA nanoparticles were coated with CMC to improve their colloidal
stability in water and in turn to increase their mobility in soils.7 Another approach reported in the literature is
the decoration of HA nanoparticles with urea; however, even if the
functionalization with amines improved the colloidal stability and
increased the disaggregation of HA nanoparticles, in this case, the
final aim was to decrease the solubility of urea and obtain a slower
and more controlled release of nitrogen.8

Although sophisticated multifunctional materials applicable
to
nanomedicine have been continuously suggested,9,10 to
the best of our knowledge, very few trials have been reported to synthesize
multifunctional nanomaterials capable of conducting multiple beneficial
actions including crop nutrition and stimulation, soil amendments,
and soil microbe flourishment. In this respect, humic substances (HSs),
which are complex and recalcitrant organic polymers widespread in
soils, are indeed a very interesting material by virtue of their ability
to stimulate plants through activation of some gene sets, thus boosting
their germination rates and abiotic stress resistance.11−13 Moreover, oxygen-based functional groups easily identifiable in
HS allow for versatile adsorption on solid surfaces14 and may thus induce surface acidity, affecting the surface
solubility of metallic oxides and HA.

Several proof-of-concept
studies on HA-based nanofertilizers mainly
reported on the size-related improvement in nutrient delivery and
crop growth.6,8,15−17 In this paper, we report on novel multifunctional,
nontoxic, and soil-friendly nanocomposites consisting of HA nanoparticles
functionalized with HS (HA–HS). HA–HS nanoparticles
have a potential for tuning HA solubility through HS-driven surface
acidity and co-releasing their crop nutritional and stimulatory components,
i.e., phosphate ions and HS, respectively, in a synergistic and time-wise
manner.

Self-assembly of water-dissolved natural and synthetic
HS on the
surfaces of HA nanoparticles was successfully performed by dipping
the nanoparticles in aqueous HS solutions. Several analytical methodologies
based on scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron
microscopy (TEM), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface
area, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), dynamic light scattering (DLS),
sedimentation kinetics, radical scavenging, size-exclusion chromatography,
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
(FT-IR) were used to characterize the synthesized materials. Finally,
crop nutrition and stimulation induced by HA–HS were assessed
using Zea mays as a model crop and
were compared with the results obtained with unmodified nano-HA and
commercial fused superphosphate (FS). The microbial community in Z. mays-cultivated soils was also analyzed to evaluate
the effects of the investigated materials on the rhizosphere.

Results
and Discussion
The physicochemical properties of uncoated
HA nanoparticles have
been extensively described in previous works.18−20 Since natural
HSs have been successfully commercialized in agronomy and are easily
obtainable in bulk from lignite and leonardite, commercial natural
HSs were employed for the functionalization with HA.11 HA nanoparticles were dipped in water solutions at different
HS concentrations, where the reciprocal affinity of the two materials
resulted in a fast and strong functionalization of the HA surface
with the HS components to form HA–HS nanocomposites. As shown
in the Y series of Figure 1A, the HA colors transformed from white to dark-brown after
this step, owing to the well-recognized chromogenic features of HS.21 More direct evidence of the adsorption was obtained
by TGA analysis of different HA–HS nanoparticles (Figure 1B and Table 1). Significant mass decreases
from 250 to 600 °C were clearly detected for all of the HA–HS
nanoparticles and were ascribed to the thermal degradation of HS.
As reported in the Y series of Table 1, the amount of HS determined by TGA was directly proportional
to the HS concentration of the dipping solutions. It was previously
demonstrated that versatile oxygen-based functional groups of HS allow
for their binding onto surfaces of metallic oxides such as titania.14 Similar binding mechanisms are likely to occur
in the case of HA–HS due to the presences of Ca atoms on the
surface of HA nanoparticles.

Radical scavenging activities and colloidal properties
of HA–HS
nanoparticles were assessed to verify whether HA nanoparticles are
endowed with new features by functionalization with HS. The blue-colored
2,2′-Azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS)
radical cations were significantly decolorized in the presence of
HA–HS (Y series of Figure 1C), indicating that the radicals were efficiently reduced.
It was previously shown that the electron-donating abilities of the
phenolic groups of HS are involved in radical scavenging activity
under aerobic conditions, suggesting that the observed decolorization
is mainly due to the HS functionalization.22 Sedimentation tests in aqueous media were performed to assess the
ability of multiple hydrophilic groups of natural HS to stabilize
aqueous suspension of HA nanoparticles, as previously reported with
other mineral particles.23Figure 1D clearly shows that sedimentation
kinetics of HA–HS nanoparticles of the Y series were much slower
than that of uncoated HA. DLS data summarized in Table 2 also support this finding,
as the zeta averages measured on Y samples were much lower than that
of unmodified HA nanoparticles. Moreover, due to the large presence
of oxygen-based functional groups in natural HS,12−14 the ζ-potentials
of these samples were much more negative than that of pure HA. Even
if a linear correlation between the net charges and the zeta averages
of nanoparticles in water dispersion was not observed, it is well
known that the electrostatic repulsion between nanoparticles with
the same electrical charge prevents their aggregation.24 The improved colloidal properties of HA–HS
in water with respect to bare HA would be particularly useful for
agronomical applications, since several agrochemicals including pesticides
are administered by crop watering.

Another evidence on the surface functionalization
of the nanoparticles
was revealed by the fact that all of the FT-IR spectra recorded on
HA–HS (Y series of Figure 1E) presented the typical features of both HA and natural
HS, as clearly visible from the magnified view in the 1300–1800
cm–1 range (Figure 1F). Within this region, the FT-IR spectra of HA were
featured by bands ascribed to (ν3) CO32– vibrations, while the spectra of natural HS were characterized by
a band at 1550 cm–1, attributed to COO–, −C–NO2, and C=C groups, and a band
at 1360 cm–1 ascribed to the occurrence of −CO–CH3 and possibly to nitrate groups.25 The two bands of HS were superimposed to those of HA in the spectra
of HA–HS, as highlighted by the occurrence of a broad shoulder
at around 1600 cm–1 and a red shift of the (ν3)
CO32– symmetric band. Noteworthy, the
intensity of these two signals was proportional to the amount of HS
determined by TGA analysis of the Y series. Carbonate anions result
from atmospheric CO2 adsorbed on the surface and/or entrapped
within the particles during the synthesis and storage. Their amount
was evaluated according to the weight loss observed between 550 and
950 °C by TGA (Table 1) and was found to be similar for all of the samples.

The increased negative ζ-potential and the FT-IR analyses
of HA–HS nanoparticles comply with the chelation of Ca2+ ions on the surface of HA nanoparticles by oxygen-based
functional groups of HS. Data in the literature support this mechanism,
as on the one hand HS are renown to have the ability to chelate metals,26 while on the other it was previously proved
that Ca2+ ions of apatite could be chelated by hydroxyl,
carboxyl, and carbonyl groups of macromolecules such as chitin and
chitosan.27

Oxidative polymerization
of lignin-derived small phenolics gives
rise to humiclike materials.28 Bulk production
of commercial HS relies heavily on natural coal resources, whose quantity
and distribution are limited. To overcome this bottleneck, alternative
uses of renewable lignin phenolics to obtain humic-like polymers having
similar biological activity with respect to natural ones have been
reported.28 To this end, in this work,
lignin-phenol-associated humic analogues were also employed to manufacture
HA nanoparticles functionalized with HS synthesized from catechol
and gallic acid or catechol and ferulic acid, named S1 and S2, respectively.
Interestingly, synthetic HS exhibited similar results compared to
the natural ones regarding coloration of HA nanoparticles, radical
scavenging of ABTS, TGA, sedimentation kinetics, and FT-IR (S series
of Figure 1 and Table 1), indicating that
it is feasible to employ synthetic HS for nanoparticle functionalization.
Like natural HS, oxygen-based hydrophilic groups derived from starting
monomers (i.e., catechol, gallic acid, and ferulic acid) may play
a role in the functionalization. Contrary to what was recorded for
samples of the Y series, the amounts of HS revealed by TGA for S1
and S2 were unrelated to the concentrations of the dipping solutions
(Table 1). In this
respect, a major role is likely played by the structural variability
of the HSs of S1 and S2, as it was previously shown that using different
monomers in oxidative polymerization of lignin phenols leads to different
physicochemical properties of the final polymer.29

SEM and TEM were employed to investigate the morphology
and the
size of HA nanoparticles. As shown in Figure 2, no significant differences between pure
HA and natural and synthetic HS-coated particles were observed. All
of the samples were composed of nanoparticles with needlelike morphologies,
with length typically in the 75–125 nm size range and width
in the 15–25 nm range. Since both SEM and TEM analyses were
performed on nanoparticles in the dry state, the aggregation observed
in these pictures was due to the prevalence of the electrostatic interactions
of nanoparticles and it was not fully representative of the actual
nanoparticle condition in aqueous dispersion. No external HS could
be detected for any HA–HS, as commonly reported for nanoparticles
coated with small amounts of organic polymers.30

Figure 2 (A) TEM, (B) SEM, and (C) XRD of pure and humic-coated hydroxyapatite
nanoparticles.

SEM–EDX
analyses were performed on HA and on the two samples containing the
highest quantity of HS, namely, S1 and Y2. Generally speaking, the
quantities of Ca and P were slightly higher than those detected by
ICP-OES reported in Table 1 and were 35.5 ± 2.2, 35.0 ± 2.0, and 33.3 ±
4.5 wt % of Ca and 18.3 ± 1.3, 17.5 ± 1.3, and 17.7 ±
0.6 wt % of P for HA, S1, and Y2, respectively. However, despite the
higher variability of EDX results with respect to ICP, the two sets
of data were in good accordance. No statistically significant difference
(p < 0.05, Student’s t test) was recorded for Ca and P contents between HS-coated and bare
HA nanoparticles. On the other hand, the amount of C was significantly
higher in both samples S1 (5.5 ± 0.6 wt %) and Y2 (8.3 ±
4.2 wt %) with respect to HA (2.8 ± 0.5 wt %). As C is the main
element of HS, this increase is ascribed to its presence on the surface
of nanoparticles, while the amount of C detected for bare HA nanoparticles
was mainly due to the presence of organic impurities. Finally, no
differences could be found between the C contents of S1 and Y2, indicating
that these nanoparticles feature similar amounts of HS on their surface.

Consistently with the SEM and TEM analyses, the XRD patterns collected
on HA–HS (Figure 2C) were also very similar to those collected on uncoated HA and featured
broad and poorly defined peaks typical of nanocrystalline apatite
that can be indexed according to the crystallographic features of
hydroxyapatite (JCPDS no. 09-432). These results support that the
coating
methods employed did not have any effect on the crystal structure
of HA nanoparticles (Figure 2C).

substances derived from
either dipping solutions or desorption from hydroxyapatite nanoparticles.

Previous agronomical studies have clearly demonstrated
that supplying
HS to crops results in the increases in mobile P in soils, thus enhancing
crop productivity.31,32 This inspired us to check whether
it is possible to tune P solubilization kinetics from HA nanoparticles
by modifying their surface with natural and synthetic HS. Compared
with uncoated HA nanoparticles, HA–HS exhibited a significant
enhancement in the release of phosphate ions (Figure 4), but this increase was not proportional
to the amount of HS (Figure 3 and Table 1). This is probably due to two concomitant phenomena:
(i) an increase in the surface acidity of HA nanoparticles determined
by the presence of oxygen-based functional groups of HS adsorbed onto
them and (ii) a reduction of the contact surface between water and
HA nanoparticles. The first determines a faster dissolution of HA
nanoparticles, i.e., a faster release of phosphate ions, while the
second hampers the interaction between the HA surface and water molecules,
slowing down P solubilization. Hence, to find the right balance between
surface acidity and water passage in the HS–HA interface might
be a critical factor in optimizing P releasing rate.

nanoparticles. (A) Natural and (B) synthetic humic substances. P contents
measured on a weekly basis were cumulated.

Desorption of humic structures from solid surfaces has been described
in previous works suggesting that physisorption is the main mechanism
governing humic-based solid attachments.33 The desorption kinetics of HS from the nanoparticles were thus monitored
through UV–vis spectrometry. Generally speaking, there is a
fair agreement between HS release kinetics (Figure 5) and HS amounts determined by TGA for all
of the samples (Table 1). Size-exclusion chromatography was then employed to characterize
humic components released from HA–HS surfaces as well as those
in the original dipping solution. As shown in Figure 3, HSs with molecular weights around 10 000
were detached from samples of the Y series, while the molecular weights
of the HS detached from samples of the S series were more diversified.
Muscolo et al. suggested that HSs with molecular weights of several
thousands of Da are involved in direct plant stimulations due to their
adsorption onto plant root surfaces, supporting that the released
humic components from HA nanoparticles can act as a direct plant stimulant.34 The released HSs are also able to chelate calcium
ions derived from the dissolution of HA nanoparticles, thus hampering
the re-precipitation of calcium phosphate.35 This inhibitory action combined with the surface acidity of HS could
be a key to tune phosphorus releasing kinetics from HA–HS nanoparticles.
In addition, these results strongly indicate that HA–HS nanoparticles
can be used for the co-delivery of crop nutrients (i.e., phosphate
ions) and stimulants (i.e., HS) toward rhizospheres in a time-wise
and synergistic manner. Finally, this co-release could maximize the
agronomical applicability of our nanofertilizers compared with previously
developed ones exclusively focusing on nutrient supply.6,8,15−17

Since maize (i.e., Z. mays) is one
of the most common food crops in the world,36 it was selected as a model to test the agronomical effectiveness
of our HA–HS nanoparticles. Co-releasing features of phosphate
ions and HS were expected to promote both growth and stress resistance,
as P is a plant macronutrient and HSs are known to stimulate several
gene sets of plants related to stress relieving.34,37 Hence, the extents of early growth, corn productivity, and resistance
to NaCl induced by HA–HS nanoparticles were evaluated and compared
with those achieved using pure HA and commercial FS featuring double-releasing
mechanisms due to the presence of fast dissolving P salts and slow-releasing
P solids.

In the early growth experiments, a similar crop height
determined
by the maize leaf length was recorded in all of the conditions, while
the growth of the crop stems was remarkably higher in plants treated
with HA–HS nanoparticles, thus resulting in a significant increase
of their fresh and dry weights compared with those measured in plants
treated with pure HA nanoparticles and commercial FS (Figure S1). Early growth rates of maize per P
unit were then assessed on the basis of the chemical composition of
the tested materials determined by ICP-OES reported in Table 1 (Figure 6A,B; the content of P element in commercial
FS was based on the product instruction). Y3 and S2 showed superior
fertilizing activities than commercial FS as well as unmodified HA
in terms of units of P supplied. It was previously reported that HSs
present in soils facilitate plant uptake of metallic micronutrients
such as iron.38,39 To evaluate whether metallic
elements and P were uptaken more by maize plants treated with HA–HS
nanoparticles than by plants treated with FS and HA nanoparticles,
the detailed contents of K, Ca, Fe, and P in the biomass were assessed
by ICP-OES analyses. As shown in Figure 6C, no significant differences were identified
among the treatment groups. This result is probably related to the
amount of HS in HA–HS nanoparticles, which is much smaller
than the typical amount of HS used in conventional humic treatments
for agronomical purposes.39 Moreover, the
interaction with HA and the consequent time-wise release of HS reasonably
lead to a further decrease in the concentration of free HS in the
soil environments.

Rhizosphere microbiome is known to positively affect crop productivity
by aiding plant nutrient uptake and inducing the plant defense mechanism.40 HSs are able to immobilize plant nutrients and
to act as electron donors/acceptors for microbial respiration.32,41 In fact, supplying HS in the soil can lead to increases in microbial
biomass, suggesting that these materials are involved in microbial
proliferation.42 Moreover, HS can exert
positive effects on the rhizosphere formation by virtue of their ability
to boost root genesis and elongation.13 Since carbon-rich root exudates are able to attract plant-beneficial
microbes and root surfaces provide physical spaces for mutualistic
microbes including mycorrhizae and rhizobia, HS-driven root growth
stimulation could be linked to enhanced rhizosphere formation, which
in turn affects soil microbiome. To check this possibility, microbial
community structures in soil rhizospheres treated with commercial
FS, uncoated HA nanoparticles, and the most promising materials selected
among the HA–HS samples (i.e., Y3 and S2) were evaluated through
metagenomic analyses of bacterial 16S ribosomal DNA sequences. As
shown in Figure 7, Rivulariaceae belonging to cyanobacteria identifiable in
croplands43 was dominant (>95%) in FS-treated
soils, whereas other treatment groups showed much more diverse microbial
compositions.

and pure and humic-coated hydroxyapatite nanoparticles. The same kind
and amount of NK fertilizers were supplied in all of the conditions.
Abbreviation: CFP, commercial fused superphosphate.

Different bacterial OTUs between pure and humic-coated HA
nanoparticles
were also detected. Xanthomonadaceae and Rhizobiaceae, which are known to be involved in symbiotic
plant–microbe interactions,44,45 were more
abundant in Y3 than in S2 (Table S2). As
shown in Table S3, the highest number of
bacterial OTUs was detected for the Y3 treatment and matched the bacterial
species typically associated with plant rhizosphere. The detected
OTU patterns in association with the enhanced root genesis observed
for HS–HA treatments (Figures S1 and S2) highlight the occurrence of a positive effect of HS slow release
on the flourishing of rhizosphere bacteria.

To further investigate
the growth promotion of maize by Y3 and
S2, maize growth experiments were prolonged until the crop was fully
grown. As shown in Table 3, grain weights derived from Y3 and S2 treatments were higher
than from treatments with bare HA nanoparticles and commercial FS.
Remarkably, the phosphorus use efficiency of Y3 and S2 was proven
to be much higher during the whole maize growth cycle, indicating
that the low plant NUE achieved with the use of conventional fertilizers
could be overcome with the use of humic-coated nanosized ones. The
much lower phosphorus uptake of pure HA nanoparticles evidences the
important role played by the functionalization with HS to overcome
the limits of HA-based nanofertilizers, especially their scarce solubility
at pH > 7 and the tendency of HA nanoparticles to form large aggregates
in the dry state. In addition, it can be concluded that the P uptake
efficiency of maize increased with increasing cultivation periods
in plants treated with HS–HA nanoparticles (Figure 6C and Table 3). Moreover, as soil P availability affects
leaf developments and the leaf area index,46 this increase could be related to the higher P availability in the
soil obtained with HS-coated nanoparticles, which would eventually
induce faster carbon fixation, resulting in increased biomass weights
(Figure 6A,B).

a Data represent means ± SD (n = 3), and statistical analysis was based on LSD (p < 0.05). The same amount of NK fertilizers was used
in all of the conditions. Phosphorus uptake and ARE were evaluated
by phosphorus contents of soils, harvested crops, and fertilizers.
Abbreviations: Commercial P, fused superphosphate; ARE, apparent recovery
efficiency by difference (i.e., the amount of nutrient uptake (treatment
– control)/the amount of nutrient treated).

The salt resistance of Z. mays under
the various treatments was compared to evaluate whether HS–HA
nanoparticles display multifunctional properties. As shown in Figure S2A, under salt-induced stress conditions,
the growth of crops treated with commercial FS was very slow and plant
leaves readily turned gray, suggesting that their chlorophyll was
completely destroyed. On the contrary, maize plants treated with pure
HA and HS–HA retained their normal appearances, determining
in turn a significant growth enhancement in terms of crop height and
fresh and dry weights with respect to the group of plants treated
with FS (Figure S2B,C). Crop growth per
unit of administered P under salt-induced stress finally highlighted
that humic-coated nanoparticles had much higher stimulating activities
than commercial FS and bare HA nanoparticles (Figure 8).

Figure 8 (A) Fresh and (B) dry weights of Z. mays at an early growth stage per unit of P supplied
in the presence
of NaCl. The same kind and amount of the NK fertilizer were supplied
in all of the conditions. Data represent means ± SD (n = 3), and statistical analysis was based on LSD (p < 0.05).

In this regard, it is
important to note that abiotic stress relieving
for crop growth was found to be related to P availability in soil.47 However, the fact that FS is very capable of
providing P nutrients to crops supports that the nutrient supply is
not enough to fully compensate for the salt-related abiotic stresses.
On the other hand, when treated with HS, plant roots are able to modulate
the expression level of high-affinity K+ transporter 1
and thus mitigate salt-induced toxicity.37 The combined action of co-released HS and phosphorus ions reported
in our study was thus able to efficiently mitigate salt-induced adverse
effects on maize growth. Further studies focusing on synergistic stimulatory
mechanisms driven by the co-presences of humic materials and P-related
nutrients for crop salt resistance should be addressed to fully figure
out the multifunctionality of these HS–HA nanocomplexes.

Conclusions
We proved that multifunctional biocompatible and biodegradable
nanoparticles for agronomical purposes could be readily synthesized
by dipping of nano-HA in a water solution of HS. Remarkably, fertilizing-
and abiotic-stress-relieving capacities in Z. mays crops treated with our multifunctional nanofertilizers were significantly
enhanced compared with commercial FS as well as with unmodified HA
nanoparticles. These effects were proven to be derived from the adsorption
of HS on the surface of nanoparticles, where they played a double
role during P solubilization. In fact, on the one hand, the increase
in the surface acidity determined by humic substances stimulated the
dissolution of hydroxyapatite nanoparticles, and on the other hand,
the presence of HS on the surface of the nanoparticles acted as a
physical barrier for water contact. The binding between HA nanoparticles
and HS enabled their reversible detachment, allowing a time-wise and
synergistic co-release of crop nutrients and stimulants, which in
turn improved crop nutrition, abiotic stress relief (Scheme 1), and rhizosphere bacteria
growth. Overall, these findings strongly support that multifunctional
nanomaterials can be obtained by simple and easily scalable processes,
and their large-scale use in agriculture could start in the near future.

Scheme 1 Proposed Sorption Mechanisms between Humic Substances and Hydroxyapatite
Nanoparticles
The assumed structure of humic
acids is from Vekariya et al.14 The organic
functional groups of humic acids potentially involved in the attachment
to the hydroxyapatite surfaces are highlighted.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2, 95%),
catechol (99%), Trametes versicolor fungal laccases (1.03 U/mg), vanado-molybdate (p.a., for phosphate
determination), nitric acid (HNO3, puriss p.a. ≥65%),
hydrochloric acid (HCl, puriss p.a. ≥37%), and potassium bromide
(KBr, FT-IR grade, ≥99% trace metal basis) were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich. Ferulic acid (98%) and ABTS (98%) were purchased from
Fluka. Sodium azide (NaN3, 99%), sodium dihydrogen phosphate
(NaH2PO4, 99%), and sulfuric acid (H2SO4, 95%) were obtained from Daejung Chem (Korea). Phosphoric
acid (H3PO4, 85%), natural HS (humic acid, >70
wt % humic matter), gallic acid hydrate (98%), and poly(styrene sulfonate)
standard materials were purchased from Merck, Mycsa AG (Texas), Tokyo
Chemical Industry (TCI, Japan) and PSS-Polymer (Maryland), respectively.
Urea, potassium chloride (KCl), and FS were purchased from Namhae
Chemical Corporation (Korea), Enpico Corporation (Korea), and Nonghyup
Corporation (Korea), respectively. Perchloric acid (HClO4), an Agencourt AMPure XP reagent bead, and a FastDNA Spin Kit were
obtained from Samchun Chem (Korea), Beckman Coulter (Italy), and MP
Biomedicals (California), respectively. Unless otherwise specified,
ultrapure water (0.22 μS, 25 °C, Milli-Q, Millipore) was
used in all of the experiments. All of the reagents were used as received
without any further purification.

Synthesis of Hydroxyapatite
Nanoparticles
HA nanoparticles
were synthesized by a neutralization method already reported by Adamiano
et al.18 with some modifications. Briefly,
10 g of Ca(OH)2 was added to 100 mL of water and then stabilized
at room temperature under constant stirring at 400 rpm for 30 min
(initial pH ∼ 12.0). A solution obtained by mixing 8.87 g of
H3PO4 with 30 mL of water was added dropwise
into the Ca(OH)2 suspension at room temperature. The molar
ratio between calcium and phosphorous was set to 1.67 and kept constant
for all of the syntheses. Once the simultaneous dropwise addition
of phosphoric was completed, the solution was kept at room temperature
under constant stirring at 400 rpm for 3 h and then left still overnight
(final pH ∼ 7.0). Finally, the powder was repeatedly washed
with water and then air-dried at 40 °C until constant weight.

Functionalization of Hydroxyapatite Nanoparticles with Natural
and Synthetic Humic Substances
Natural HS was dissolved in
autoclaved distilled water at three different concentrations (i.e.,
0.01, 0.1, and 0.05 g/mL). After removing water-insoluble HS through
centrifugation (13 000 rpm, 10 min), HA nanoparticles (1 g)
were added to the humic solution (9.9 mL), vigorously vortexed, and
further incubated under agitation on a roller (60 rpm, 20 min) at
room temperature. HS-coated HA nanoparticles were isolated via centrifugation
(13 000 rpm, 10 min), and the pellets were vortexed with autoclaved
distilled water to remove loosely attached HS. HA was recovered by
centrifugation, and the resulting pellet was dried at 55 °C and
ground in a mortar. Samples obtained by soaking HA nanoparticles in
the solutions at 0.01, 0.1, and 0.05 g/mL of natural HS were named
Y1, Y2, and Y3, respectively. Synthetic HSs were obtained via enzymatic
polymerization of lignin-derived phenolics as described previously.28 Briefly, either catechol (0.1 g) and gallic
acid (0.1 g) or catechol (0.1 g) and ferulic acid (0.1 g) were polymerized
by single-electron oxidation using fungal T. versicolor laccases (2.65 mg) in 100 mM sodium acetate buffer containing 20%
EtOH (40 mL) at room temperature overnight. HA nanoparticles were
then immersed in the resulting solutions, following the same procedure
already described for the natural HS coating. The HA samples coated
with the polymers from catechol/gallic acid and catechol/ferulic acid
were finally named S1 and S2, respectively.

Radical Scavenging and
Water Sedimentation Kinetics
The extent of radical scavenging
driven by bare HA or HA–HS
nanoparticles was based on ABTS radical decolorization. The blue ABTS
radical cations were produced through fungal-laccase-catalyzed single-electron
oxidation of ABTS, followed by ultrafiltration (5000 MWCO, Vivaspin
15R, Sartorius). The absorbance of the ultrafiltrated radical solution
at 420 nm was adjusted to 1.6 by adding distilled water. The radical
solutions (1 mL) were then incubated overnight with bare HA or HA–HS
nanoparticles (1 mg) under agitation on a roller (60 rpm). After centrifugation
(13 000 rpm, 10 min), the absorbance of the supernatants was
measured at 420 nm and subtracted with the absorbance of the control,
consisting in a water dispersion of pure and humic-coated HA nanoparticles
without ABTS.

Size-Exclusion Chromatography
Size-exclusion
analysis
of HS was performed using a PolySep GFC-P3000 300 × 7.80 mm2 (Phenomenex), preceded by a PolySep GFC-P 35 × 7.80
safety guard (Phenomenex) with high-performance liquid chromatography
(a Waters 2695 system with a Waters 996 photodiode array detector)
as described previously.12 Syringe-filtered
(0.45 μm PTFE, Advantec) humic solutions used for the dipping
of HA nanoparticles were analyzed with a mobile phase of 0.1 M NaH2PO4 solution buffered at pH 6.5 containing 4.6
mM NaN3. Their separations were then monitored at 280 nm
with a 0.6 mL/min flow rate. Poly(styrene sulfonate) showing 6520,
14 900, and 145 000 Mw (Da)
and ferulic acid were employed to make a calibration curve as performed
previously.12 The same procedure was followed
to analyze the HS detached from coated HA nanoparticles in distilled
water (30 mg/mL) after 1 day of incubation at room temperature.

Co-release of Phosphate Ions and Humic Substances
Pure
and humic-coated HA nanoparticles (1 g) were suspended in distilled
water (40 mL) and placed under agitation on a roller (60 rpm). A 1
mL aliquot of the solutions was taken for the quantification of phosphate
ions and humic contents each week. Subsequently, fresh autoclaved
distilled water was re-supplied weekly to prevent the saturation of
the soluble materials in the given water volume as well as to fully
mimic rhizosphere environments, where solubilized nutrients are uptaken
by plants and microbes. HS desorption kinetics from HS–HA nanoparticles
in water was quantified by the spectrometric detection at 470 nm of
the supernatant recovered by centrifugation (13 000 rpm, 10
min) of the 1 mL aliquot. Phosphate release was determined by a vanado-molybdate
colorimetric method at 470 nm performed on the same aliquot by subtracting
the absorbance values ascribed to HS desorption. The release patterns
of phosphate ions and humic structures were recorded in duplicate,
and no significant difference in the patterns was observed.

Chemical
Analysis
Calcium and phosphate contents of
pure and humic-coated HA nanoparticles were determined using inductively
coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) on a Liberty
200 spectrometer (Agilent Technologies 5100 ICP-OES, Santa Clara,
CA) employing wavelengths of 422.673 (Ca) and 213.618 nm (P). A total
of 20 mg of dried samples was dissolved in 50 mL of 2 wt % HNO3 or 2 wt % HCl solutions prior to the analysis.

X-ray Diffraction
Analysis
The phase composition of
each powder was determined by XRD with a D8 Advance diffractometer
(Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany) equipped with a Lynx-eye position-sensitive
detector using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å) generated
at 40 kV and 40 mA. XRD spectra were recorded in the 2θ range
of 10–60° with a step size (2θ) of 0.04° and
a counting time of 0.5 s.

Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy Analysis
FT-IR
spectra of dried samples in KBr disks were recorded at room temperature
using an FT-IR Nicolet 380 from Thermo Electron Corporation working
in the range of wavenumbers 4000–400 cm–1 at a resolution of 2 cm–1. A finely ground, approximately
0.05% (w/w) mixture of the sample in KBr was pressed into a transparent
disk using a hydraulic press and applying a pressure of about 670
MPa.

ζ-Potential and Size Measurements
ζ-Potential
distributions of dried powders suspended in water were measured by
dynamic light scattering (DLS) with a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Ltd,
Worcestershire, U.K.) and were quantified by laser Doppler velocimetry
as electrophoretic mobility using a disposable electrophoretic cell
(DTS1061, Malvern Ltd., Worcestershire, U.K.). A total of 10 runs
of 30 s were performed for each measurement, and four measurements
were carried out for each sample. Zeta average values were obtained
by suspending the dry powders in the same media at a concentration
of 1.0 mg/mL. A total of 20 runs of 30 s each were performed for each
measurement and for each sample.

Transmission and Scanning
Electron Microscopy Analyses
Sample morphology and size in
a dry state were analyzed on an FEI
Tecnai F20 transmission electron microscope equipped with a Schottky
emitter and operating at 120 and 200 keV. A total of 10 μL
of the material suspended in deionized water at 10.0 mg/mL
was dissolved in 5 mL of isopropanol and treated with ultrasound.
A droplet of the resulting finely dispersed suspensions was evaporated
at room temperature and under the atmospheric pressure on a holey
film supported on a copper grid. For SEM analysis (FEI Quanta 200,
Eindhoven, The Netherlands), nanoparticles were placed on a carbon
tape and then gold-coated using a Sputter Coater E5100 (Polaron Equipment,
Watford, Hertfordshire, U.K.) at 30 mA under argon at 10–3 mbar for 4 min. For SEM–EDX analysis, samples were deposited
on a flat, mirror-polished silicon wafer mounted on an aluminum SEM
stub and analyzed through an EDX microanalysis detector (INCA Energy
300, Oxford Instruments, Abingdon-on-Thames, U.K.). The microanalysis
was performed in four different regions of the samples on squared
areas of 2 μm × 2 μm at an acceleration voltage of
10 keV and was carried out at 5000× magnification.

Thermogravimetric
Analysis
TGA was performed using
an STA 449F3 Jupiter (Netzsch GmbH, Selb, Germany) apparatus. About
10 mg of the sample was weighted in an alumina crucible and heated
from room temperature to 1100 °C under an air flow with a heating
rate of 10 °C/min.

Crop Growth, Productivity, and Abiotic Stress
Resistance
The early growth and abiotic stress resistance
of maize (i.e., Z. mays) were evaluated
with a pot experiment (0.0123
m2) using a regular growth chamber (16 h/8 h light/dark
cycle at 23 °C). The same amount of NK fertilizers (N, 211.3
mg, urea; K, 129.2 mg, KCl) was used in all of the tested conditions,
while twice the amount of FS (184.6 mg) was used with respect to HA–HS
nanoparticles (92.3 mg). Early growth rates of maize were assessed
in terms of height and fresh and dry weights. Dry weights were measured
after 2 day incubation of the fresh biomass at 60 °C until a
constant weight was reached. The biomass increase per unit of P in
fertilizers was calculated based on the ICP quantification of HA and
humic-coated HA. Some nutritional elements (i.e., K, Ca, Fe, and P)
of maize at an early growth stage were assessed based on ICP-OES analysis
of the dried crop powders that were mechanically ground and then completely
digested with an acid solution containing distilled water, 60% HClO4, and H2SO4 (1:9:5 v/v/v ratio) at 300
°C for approximately 6 h. Salt stress experiments were also conducted
under the same conditions as above, but soils (970.0 g) were premixed
with sodium chloride (3.0 g) and maize seedlings pregrown in a bed
soil were transferred to the salty soils.

Long-term maize corn
productivity and P nutrient use efficiency were measured on pot cultivation
of Z. mays (0.05 m2) in
a greenhouse for approximately 3 months. NPK treatments (i.e., urea
(860.0 mg), FS (751.7 mg), and KCl (525.8 mg)) were performed as recommended
by the Rural Development Administration in South Korea. Experiments
with HA and HA–HS were performed as already described for early
growth experiments, i.e., replacing FS with half the quantity of nanoparticles.
Dry weights of the fully grown maize were measured after 3 day incubation
at 70 °C, and their P contents in detail were assessed through
vanado-molybdate-based colorations of phosphate ions derived from
the acid digestion of finely ground maize powders as already described
above. The physicochemical characteristics of soils used for all of
the maize cultivation experiments are shown in Table S1.

Soil Microbiome Analysis
Soils near
maize roots were
collected at the harvest for the early growth experiments and stored
at −75 °C for further DNA extraction. Metagenomic DNA
extraction was performed with a FastDNA Spin Kit for Soil (MP Biomedicals).
Polymerase chain reaction primers to obtain bacterial 16S rDNA amplicon
were 341F (5′-CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG-3′) and 805R (5′-GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC-3′).
The PCR products were then purified with an Agencourt AMPure XP reagent
bead and sequenced with a MiSeq 250 paired-end system (Illumina).
FLASH (Fast Length Adjustment of SHort reads, v1.2.11)-based sequence
assembly was employed. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were obtained
by CD-HIT-OTU (http://weizhongli-lab.org/cd-hit-otu/)-based clustering DNA sequences showing greater than 97% sequence
homology. Representative OTUs were assigned to corresponding species
(query coverage > 85% and identity > 85%) with the NCBI 16S
microbial
database using the BLASTN v. 2.4.0+ algorithm.
