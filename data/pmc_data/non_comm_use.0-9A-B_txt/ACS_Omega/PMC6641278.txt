A magnetically
active Fe3O4/poly(ethylene
oxide)-block-poly(butadiene) (PEO-b-PBD) nanocomposite is formed by the encapsulation of magnetite nanoparticles
with a short-chain amphiphilic block copolymer. This material is then
incorporated into the self-assembly of higher order polymer architectures,
along with an organic pigment, to yield biosynthetic, bifunctional
optical and magnetically active Fe3O4/bacteriochlorophyll c/PEO-b-PBD polymeric chlorosomes.

Introduction
In
nature, a wide range of structural architectures and functional
responses are formed through lipid assemblies, leading to essential
roles in a number of physiological processes.1,2 Biolike
membrane structures have been mimicked via self-assembly of amphiphilic
block copolymers, albeit typically with much larger molecular weight
polymers relative to lipids.3,4 Amphiphilic block copolymers
are composed of a hydrophobic domain and a hydrophilic domain and
are known to self-assemble thermodynamically into spherical micelles,
worm-like micelles, bilayers, and other structures, depending on the
ratio of hydrophobicity to hydrophilicity.5−7 Furthermore,
they have shown increased morphological flexibility when compared
with lipids, as well as the ability to possess additional functionality.3,6,8−10 Such functionality
can be introduced through the incorporation of nanoparticles (NPs),
organic molecules, and functional groups. For example, magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles were encapsulated by modified
poly(ethylene oxide)–poly(propylene oxide)–poly(ethylene
oxide) (PEO–PPO–PEO) triblock copolymer and used effectively
as a temperature-responsive material for targeted drug delivery.11,12 Mai and Eisenberg incorporated magnetic nanoparticles into the central
compartment of a number of different copolymer architectures, including
vesicles, rods, and micelles.13,14 Likewise, Hickey et
al. showed that small 5.6 nm iron oxide nanoparticles could be incorporated
directly into the walls of copolymer vesicles.15,16

Recently, the block copolymer poly(ethylene oxide)-block-poly(butadiene) (PEO-b-PBD) was self-assembled
along with the π-stacked organic pigment, molecule bacteriochlorophyll c (BChl c), to form an artificial supramolecular
light-harvesting system.17 BChl c aggregates exhibit high exciton diffusion lengths and
are strong candidates for developing bioinspired light-harvesting
systems.18,19 The resulting polymer architectures therefore
mimicked green bacterial light-harvesting systems called chlorosomes,
yet with the simplicity of a single polymer species. Furthermore,
these polymer–chlorosome nanocomposites (PCNs) allowed for
incorporation of nonnative combinations of various BChl species, tuning
the optical response of the system, as well as demonstrating the increased
flexibility of polymer-based systems.20 Importantly, such functional chlorosome mimics exhibited a long-range
order which had never been achieved in a nanocomposite, even when
using isolated components, including native lipids.21 The structure of the PCNs was a result of the flexibility
of the amphiphilic block copolymers, which created an environment
in which a long-range order of BChl c was possible,
thereby demonstrating a tremendous advantage over lipids in creating
bioinspired architectures.

Here, we exploit the morphological
flexibility of PEO-b-PBD to form a Fe3O4/PEO-b-PBD magnetically active nanocomposite
via nanoparticle encapsulation.
This isotropic nanocomposite maintains the strong magnetic properties
and tight size distribution of magnetite nanoparticles formed by solvothermal
synthesis,22 while also showing long-term
stability in aqueous solution. We show that this material can be included
in the self-assembly of higher order architectures, leading to Fe3O4/BChl c/PEO-b-PBD magnetic polymer–chlorosome nanocomposites (m-PCNs),
without any disruption in the organization of the BChl c long-range aggregates. These m-PCNs show not only an optical response
but also a strong magnetic response, which will allow for spatial
manipulation of an artificial light-harvesting system by the application
of an external magnetic field.

Results and Discussion
To begin,
we encapsulated magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles
with 2.5 kDa PEO-b-PBD by a modified
film rehydration technique (for full experimental details, please
see the Supporting Information).24 This particular molecular weight copolymer contains
approximately 30 PEO and 22 PBD segments and has previously shown
good morphological flexibility, including the ability to form higher
order architectures.17,25 Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) revealed well-dispersed nanoparticles with a uniform spherical
shape and an average size of 21.5 ± 1.0 nm (Figure 1a). The interparticle spacing
was measured from multiple TEM images to be 4.7 nm, which is significantly
larger than what has been observed with oleic acid-capped nanoparticles,
suggesting successful encapsulation.22 This
observation is supported by the emergence of good water solubility,
provided by the expression of PEO at the surface (Figure 1a, inset). The stability of
the Fe3O4/PEO-b-PBD nanocomposites
in water was observed over time, with no evidence of flocculation
occurring after one year. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) was
performed on the oleic acid-capped Fe3O4 nanoparticles
to confirm the size analysis provided by TEM.26Figure 1B shows the
raw scattering data overlaid with a model fit performed assuming a
Gaussian size distribution, as observed in TEM, along with the corresponding
residuals. SAXS gave a nanoparticle size of 22.5 ± 0.7 nm, in
good agreement with TEM. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements
were then carried out to investigate the hydrodynamic radii of the
various nanoparticle species (Figure S1a,b). DLS showed that oleic acid-capped nanoparticles suspended in hexane
possessed hydrodynamic radii of 24 ± 2.9 nm, the slight increase
from TEM and SAXS being attributed to the organic surface ligands.
The hydrodynamic radius of the Fe3O4/PEO-b-PBD nanocomposite particles suspended in H2O measured 56 ± 12 nm.

(a) Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) image of 21.5 ± 1.0 nm Fe3O4 nanoparticles coated in 2.5 kDa PEO-b-PBD block copolymer, which provides good aqueous stability (inset).
(b) Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) size analysis showing raw
scattering data overlaid with the Gaussian model fit and associated
residuals. (c) Vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) performed on the
nanoparticles before and after encapsulation. Saturation magnetizations
measured 62 Am2/kg Fe3O4 and 56 Am2/kg Fe3O4. (d) Zero-field-cooled–field-cooled
(ZFC–FC) measurements performed before and after encapsulation.
The blocking temperature (TB) was observed
to increase slightly from 310 to 349 K, along with a broadening of
the ZFC peak indicative of dipolar interactions.23

To confirm that the nanoparticles
were coated by encapsulation
and not by a ligand exchange process, we first added a fluorescent
agent to the Fe3O4 nanoparticle surface.27 This was carried out by refluxing an aliquot
of oleic acid-capped Fe3O4 nanoparticles in
the presence of BODIPY FL C16. The carboxylate moiety of BODIPY exchanged
at the surface with oleic acid, with the long C16 carbon
chain providing good particle stability. Fluorescence emission measurements
of the BODIPY-capped nanoparticles were performed with peak excitation
and emission wavelengths of 509 and 514 nm measured, respectively
(Figure S2). Following the PEO-b-PBD encapsulation step, the nanocomposite remained fluorescent
with peak excitation and emission wavelengths measured at 509 and
514 nm, respectively (Figure S3). These
measurements confirm that PEO-b-PBD is being added
to the system by encapsulation.

The magnetic properties of the
oleic acid-capped nanoparticles
and the Fe3O4/PEO-b-PBD nanocomposite
were then compared using vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM). Saturation
magnetization, Msat, was measured to be
62 Am2/kg Fe3O4 before encapsulation
and 56 Am2/kg Fe3O4 following encapsulation,
indicating the presence of PEO-b-PBD does not significantly
affect the magnetization of the iron oxide nanoparticles (Figure 1c). The strong Msat meant that the Fe3O4/PEO-b-PBD nanocomposite particles could be rapidly
isolated from solution with the application of an external magnetic
field. Zero-field-cooled–field-cooled (ZFC–FC) curves
are given in Figure 1d. The oleic acid-capped Fe3O4 nanoparticles
display a well-defined blocking temperature, TB, 310 K, matching closely with previous observations of similar-sized
magnetite nanoparticles.22 Following encapsulation,
the ZFC curve broadened, accompanied by an increase in TB to 349 K. This is indicative of dipolar interactions,
which would suggest there is a population of nanoparticles that have
been encapsulated as dimers, trimers, or larger aggregates.23 This was confirmed by TEM (Figure S4).

Scheme 1 shows the
formation of higher order bifunctional Fe3O4/BChl c/PEO-b-PBD magnetically
and optically active polymeric chlorosome nanocomposites (m-PCNs).
We first performed a simple size selection step to remove any larger
aggregates in the Fe3O4/PEO-b-PBD nanocomposite, via centrifugation. The resulting particles are
then dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (THF), along with certain amounts
of PEO-b-PBD and BChl c. Each component
is initially well solvated by THF; however, as a buffer is slowly
introduced, the polarity of the solution increases and there is a
driving force for self-assembly.17 This
is the well-known cosolvent processing method of block copolymers,
which is often used to introduce “cargo” to lipid and
polymer vesicles. Here, the BChl c and Fe3O4 nanoparticles can be considered analogous to hydrophobic
drug cargo.28,29 Incorporating oleic acid-capped
Fe3O4 nanoparticles into the chlorosomes was
unsuccessful, primarily due to low solubility in THF.

Scheme 1 Fe3O4/BChl c/PEO-b-PBD Polymer–Chlorosome Nanocomposites (m-PCNs) Formed through
the Self-Assembly of Magnetite (Fe3O4) Nanoparticles,
Bacteriochlorophyll c (BChl c),
and the 2.5 kDa Block Copolymer Amphiphile, Poly(ethylene oxide)-block-Poly(butadiene)
Self-assembly
occurs when a solution
mixture containing the various component fractions is slowly infused
with a buffer solution.

Figure 2 shows the
results from the self-assembly of PEO-b-PBD to form
polymeric chlorosomes, as well as the incorporation of Fe3O4/PEO-b-PBD nanocomposite particles. Figure 2a,b shows linear
sucrose density gradient (10–30%) experiments for the various
self-assembled PEO-b-PBD architectures, which give
a facile means of separation and product selection from nonideal synthesis. Figure 2a shows the results
when no Fe3O4/PEO-b-PBD nanocomposites
were included in the self-assembly step. Here, we observed the emergence
of a strong band at ∼25% sucrose, which has previously been
attributed to PEO-b-PBD polymeric chlorosomes containing
self-aggregated BChl c in the hydrophobic region.17Figure 2b shows the results of the sucrose gradient formed after adding
0.225 mg of Fe3O4/PEO-b-PBD
nanocomposite in the THF solution prior to self-assembly. We observe
a second fraction as a pellet, forming at the lower limit of the sucrose
gradient, which indicates the incorporation of much more dense Fe3O4 nanoparticles and the formation of m-PCNs. The
respective bands of interest were then measured using UV–vis
absorbance spectroscopy (Figure 2c). The m-PCNs also showed an absorbance peak located
at 740 nm, characteristic of aggregated BChl c, indicating
incorporation and aggregation of the chromophore similar to native
chlorosomes and PCNs.21 The closely matched
absorbance profiles confirm that the optical characteristics of aggregated
BChl c are not affected by the incorporation of Fe3O4. TEM experiments were then performed on both
the unloaded and loaded PCNs. Figure 2d shows a TEM image of PCNs collected from the band
at 25% sucrose in Figure 2a. The unloaded PCNs range in size from 131 to 359 nm, with
aspect ratios measuring between 1.9 and 7.3 (Figure S5). Figure 2e–i show TEM images of m-PCNs collected from the dense pellet
in Figure 2b, formed
from the incorporation of Fe3O4/PEO-b-PBD nanocomposite particles. The m-PCN shown in Figure 2e possesses seven
nanoparticles, segregated toward one end of the structure. This localization
may be due to either magnetic effects or gravitational effects arising
during the sucrose gradient separation step. Figure 2e–i shows a number of different TEM
images of m-PCNs, with nanoparticle loading ranging from 2 to 6. In
all m-PCNs, the interparticle spacing has reduced significantly and
is consistent with interdigitated oleic acid.30 This would indicate that the PEO-b-PBD is being
removed from the corona of the Fe3O4/PEO-b-PBD nanocomposite upon self-assembly and that its role
is primarily to render the nanoparticles soluble in THF prior to buffer
infusion. This is also consistent with the incorporation of hydrophobic
cargo into the polymer architecture; i.e., the oleic acid-capped nanoparticles
are incorporated alongside BChl c. The m-PCNs could
be easily separated from solution by the application of an external
magnetic field. It is important to note that the m-PCNs exhibit spectral
and morphological properties of PCNs while still allowing for the
incorporation of the Fe3O4 particles, which
could easily be imagined to disrupt the long-range order. The morphological
flexibility of PEO-b-PBD therefore allows the incorporation
of multiple components, and bifunctionality is induced. This result
is another indication of the usefulness of amphiphilic block copolymers
in generating biosynthetic nanocomposites and indicates the potential
of extending design principles to develop new functional, complex
materials.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have
utilized the morphological flexibility of
the block copolymer PEO-b-PBD to form a magnetically
active Fe3O4/PEO-b-PBD nanocomposite.
The nanocomposite shows excellent aqueous stability, while maintaining
the strong magnetic properties of the magnetite nanoparticles. We
then incorporate the nanocomposite into the self-assembly step of
higher order polymeric chlorosome architectures. By including magnetic
nanoparticles alongside a self-aggregating chromophore (BChl c) in the self-assembly step, we form bifunctional magnetic
and optically active Fe3O4/BChl c/PEO-b-PBD polymeric chlorosome nanocomposites (m-PCNs).
The polymeric backbone structure is capable of including the large,
Fe3O4 nanoparticles, while still resulting in
the expected PCN morphology and spectral properties. Introducing a
magnetic response to the m-PCNs will allow for easier integration
into functional, hierarchical assemblies, as well as ordered films.
Furthermore, because the optical profile of the π-stacked BChl c is directional, the application of a magnetic field will
allow for control over the absorption characteristics of the chlorosomes
and a switching response will be possible.31

Experimental Section
Materials
PrecisionMRX oleic acid-coated
magnetite
(Fe3O4) nanoparticles were supplied by Imagion
Biosystems, Inc (Albuquerque, NM). 4,4-Difluoro-5,7-dimethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-hexadecanoic
acid (BODIPY FL C16) was purchased from Invitrogen (#D-3821). PEO-b-PBD (2.5 kDa) was purchased from polymer source (#P2904-BdEO).
BChl c was purified, as described previously.17 Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris) and all
organic solvents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

Encapsulation
of Fe3O4 NPs
Oleic
acid-coated Fe3O4 NPs (0.5 mg) and 2.5 kDa PEO-b-PBD (8.47 mg) were added to 3 mL of hexane in a 20 mL
scintillation vial and shaken overnight. The hexane was then removed
by rotary evaporation, and 3 mL of water was added to the vial. The
vial was vortex-mixed and sonicated at 25 kHz for 15 min. The solution
was then size-selected to remove larger agglomerates by centrifuging
at 4000 rcf for 10 min. The supernatant was collected and characterized
by dynamic light scattering (DLS), then used for further experiments.

Fluorescent Labeling of PEO-b-PBD-Fe3O4 NPs
Oleic acid-coated Fe3O4 NPs (0.5 mg) were added to 3 mL of toluene along with 10.3
μL of a 1 mg/mL solution of BODIPY FL C16 in methanol. This
was heated to reflux and left to react for 4 h, after which the solution
was allowed to cool to room temperature and the toluene and methanol
were removed by rotary evaporation. The fluorescent nanoparticles
were then washed once with toluene and methanol by centrifugation,
then dispersed in hexane. PEO-b-PBD encapsulation
was then carried out as outlined above.

Formation of Fe3O4/BChl c/PEO-b-PBD
Polymer–Chlorosome Nanocomposites
(m-PCNs)
PCNs with encapsulated Fe3O4 NPs were prepared by solvent exchange. First, 30 μmol BChl c, 1.5 μmol PEO-b-PBD, and 0.225
mg of Fe3O4/PEO-b-PBD nanocomposite
particles were dissolved in 50 μL of THF. One milliliter of
Tris buffer (pH = 8.0) was infused into the THF mixtures at 2 mL/h,
while stirring. The final concentration of THF was approximately 5%
of the total sample volume. Samples were purified on continuous sucrose
(10–30%) density gradients containing 20 mM Tris (pH = 8.0)
at 250 000g for 15 h and 4 °C. Sucrose
density gradients centrifugation is a differential centrifugation
technique used to separate mixtures on the basis of density. In the
experiments used here, the incorporation of Fe3O4 increases the density of the overall assembly and thus particles
containing and lacking magnetite can be separated and purified.

Characterization
Fluorescence data were acquired on
a Photon Technology International (Edison, NJ) fluorometer. Dynamic
light scattering (DLS) was measured on a Zetasizer Nano (Malvern Instruments
Ltd, Malvern, U.K.) on samples that were dialyzed to remove sucrose
prior to analysis. Absorbance spectra were acquired on a Cary 6000i
(Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) spectrometer. TEM samples
were prepared by drop-casting the hexane dispersion on a carbon-coated
copper grid. Images were collected using a Philips Tecnai high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy operating at 300 keV. SAXS analysis
was performed by injecting concentrated solutions of samples suspended
in hexanes into glass capillary tubes with a 1.0 mm diameter (Charles
Supper Company, Natick, MA). Samples were analyzed using a Rigaku
SmartLab II diffractometer system with the SmartLab Guidance system
control software. Data analysis was performed using Rigaku NANO-Solver
version 3.5 software, assuming a spherical form factor and Gaussian
size distribution. Magnetization measurements were collected using
a Quantum Design Versalab Vibrating Sample Magnetometer. Magnetization
curves were recorded from −3 to +3 T at 50 K. Zero-field-cooled
(ZFC) magnetization curves were obtained by cooling the sample to
50 K with no applied field, then applying a field of 10 Oe and recording
the magnetization from 50 to 400 K. With the field still applied,
the sample was then cooled from 400 to 50 K to obtain the field-cooled
(FC) magnetization. The precise iron mass of each sample was determined
destructively by heating the sample in a 600 °C furnace for 1
h to incinerate the organic material and then dissolving the iron-containing
residue in hydrochloric acid. A phenanthroline/Fe2+ complex
was formed in solution and spectrophotometrically quantified.
