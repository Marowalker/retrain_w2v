Response
surface methodology was applied to optimize
the processing parameters (dosage of NaOH, dosage of H2O2, reaction temperature, liquid-to-solid ratio, stirring
rate, and reaction time) that affected the leaching process of vanadium
and chromium. The results indicated that the leaching process of vanadium
was significantly affected by the dosage of NaOH and dosage of H2O2 used in the experiments, whereas the processing
parameters affected the leaching efficiency of chromium in the following
order: dosage of H2O2 (F) > reaction temperature
(C) > dosage of NaOH (A) > reaction time (B) > stirring rate
(D) > liquid-to-solid ratio (E). Almost 98.60% of vanadium and
79.82% of chromium were leached out during the leaching process.

1 Introduction
Vanadium
and chromium are
important national strategy resources and widely used in petrochemical
industry, catalysts, and iron steel because of their excellent physicochemical
properties.1−8 To
date, many technologies have been applied to leach out vanadium and
chromium. Roasting-leaching is a common technology for vanadium extraction.
Vanadium in low valence is oxidized to sodium vanadate with the addition
of sodium salt in sodium-roasting technology.9 Also, calcium-roasting technology has been applied to overcome some
problems associated with sodium-roasting technology, such as the amount
of harmful gases like Cl2 and SO2 and agglomeration
during roasting process with sodium salts at low melting points. Lime
or limestone was added to the slag, and vanadium in low valence was
oxidized to CaV2O6, Ca2V2O7, and Ca3V2O8.10−1410−14 The
parameters affecting the leaching efficiency of vanadium including
the dosage of CaO and roasting temperature and the roasting mechanism
have attracted much more attention. Acid leaching technology was applied
in leaching out vanadium from stone coal or was coupled with calcium-roasting
technologies.15−17 Liquid-phase
oxidation technologies including electro-oxidation and submolten salt
technology were also used to leach out vanadium.18−22

In many cases, the single-parameter experiment
method was applied to investigate the parameters affecting the hydrometallurgical
process, in which only one parameter changed and others held constant.
In these processes, only the effect of a single processing parameter
was investigated, whereas the interactions among different parameters
were ignored.23−25 In
recent studies,21 the parameters affecting
the leaching efficiency of vanadium and chromium including the dosage
of NaOH, reaction time, stirring rate, reaction temperature, liquid-to-solid
ratio, and dosage of H2O2 from vanadium–chromium
residues were studied, whereas the effects of interactions among different
parameters were ignored. Moreover, also which was the most significant
parameter is still unknown. Response surface methodology (RSM)26−30 is an efficient method that offers a large
amount of information from a relatively small number of experiments,
allowing the observation of both the effect of the independent variables
on the response and their possible interactions. In addition, it has
been extensively applied for the optimization study of test parameters
and obtained response surfaces. Therefore, the aim of this article
was mainly to optimize the leaching conditions of the leaching process
of vanadium–chromium residues oxidized with H2O2 in alkaline medium. The optimal leaching conditions were
optimized by RSM. The experimental results could provide the technical
basis for the hydrometallurgical technologies for leaching of vanadium
and chromium.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Single-Parameter
Experiments
The recent studies21,22 showed that
the six processing parameters including the dosage of NaOH, dosage
of H2O2, reaction time, reaction temperature,
stirring rate, and liquid-to-solid ratio affected the leaching efficiency
of vanadium and chromium significantly. Vanadium and chromium could
be easily leached out with the addition of H2O2 in alkaline medium.

2.2 Analysis of the Adequacy
of the Fitted Model
Experiments
were carried out to analyze the effect of processing parameters on
the leaching efficiencies of vanadium and chromium. The design points
and experimental results are presented in detail in Table S1.

2.2.1 Natural Logarithm Model

The
natural logarithm model, which was used to express the simulated results,
for the leaching efficiency of vanadium after insignificant terms
(p-values > 0.1) is presented in eq 1 1  The results
of the responses for the leaching efficiency of vanadium with analysis
of variance are given in detail in Table 1. The F-value and p-value for the model were 7.12 and 0.0005, respectively,
which indicated that the model was significant and could be used to
describe the optimization process.

The
square-root model, which was used to express the simulated results,
for the leaching efficiency of chromium after insignificant terms
(p-values > 0.1) is presented in eq 2 2  The results for
chromium are given
in detail in Table 2. The F-value for the model was 68.59. The corresponding p-value for the model was < 0.0001, which indicated that
the model was significant and could be used to describe the optimization
process.

2.3 Response
Surfaces and Contour Plots
It could be seen from Figure 1 that the internally
studentized residuals were almost in a straight line, which indicated
that the normal probability was in a normal distribution. Also, the
leaching efficiency of vanadium was more stable than that of chromium.
The predicted results versus actual results are plotted in Figure 2. It was shown that
the predicted leaching efficiency of chromium was more in agreement
with the actual results than that of the leaching efficiency of vanadium.
This also meant that the simulated model was valid and could be used
to predict the actual results. Figure 3 shows the plot of the internally studentized residual
responses versus the predicted responses; the internally studentized
residual responses were random and had no obvious regulation. This
indicated that the actual results were dependent on the processing
parameters.

Figure 1 Plot of normal probability
vs the internally studentized residuals.

Figure 2 Predicted responses vs
the actual values.

Figure 3 Internally studentized
residuals vs the predicted responses.

The perturbation plot in Figure 4 shows a comparison of all of the processing
parameters. The leaching efficiency response results were drawn by
changing only one processing parameter over its range while keeping
the other processing parameters constant. For the leaching process
of vanadium, the influence of processing parameters on the obtained
leaching efficiency response followed the order: dosage of NaOH (A)
> dosage of H2O2 (F) > reaction temperature
(C) > liquid-to-solid ratio (E) > stirring rate (D) > reaction
time (B). The comparatively sharp line of dosage of NaOH significantly
affected the leaching efficiency. Note that the coefficient of the
dosage of NaOH in eq 2 is extremely high. The increase of NaOH increased the reaction activity
of the hydroxide ions and enabled the oxidation reactions to be thermodynamically
more favorable.21 It also intensified the
oxidation solubility and mass transfer efficiency during the leaching
process. eq 2 and the
perturbation plot show that the reaction time and stirring rate exhibited
parabola effects. The leaching efficiency increased linearly with
the increase of the dosage of NaOH and dosage of H2O2 in the chosen design space.

Figure 4 Perturbation plot for
the leaching efficiencies of vanadium
and chromium (A: dosage of NaOH; B: dosage of H2O2; C reaction time; D: reaction temperature; E: stirring rate; and
F: liquid-to-solid ratio).

While taking the leaching
process of chromium into account, the influence of processing parameters
on the obtained leaching efficiency response followed the order: dosage
of H2O2 (F) > reaction temperature (C) >
dosage of NaOH (A) > reaction time (B) > stirring rate (D) >
liquid-to-solid ratio (E). The dosage of H2O2 (F) significantly affected the leaching efficiency of chromium,
and the reaction temperature (C) exhibited curvature effects, whereas
other parameters had no significant effects. The leaching efficiency
of chromium was significantly affected by the dosage of H2O2,21,2221,22 whereas it
was hardly leached out in alkaline leaching without H2O2.3131 In other words, the leaching process of chromium was dependent on
the addition of H2O2.

Three-dimensional
plots were applied to investigate the interaction among processing
parameters. In such plots, two processing parameters were changed
while keeping the other four processing parameters constant. The results
given in detail in Figures S1–S8 show that the leaching efficiency of vanadium was increased with
the increasing dosage of NaOH. Moreover, the leaching efficiency of
chromium was significantly affected by the dosage of NaOH and dosage
of H2O2.

2.4 Optimization
of Leaching Parameters and the Model Validation
The effects
of a single parameter and interaction among parameters
were discussed above. The optimal leaching conditions were also investigated.
Optimum conditions were obtained when all of the processing parameters
were selected “within the range” and the leaching efficiency
of vanadium or chromium was maximum. The processing parameters and
related responses are given in detail in Table 3 and Figure 5. The selected optimum conditions with a desirability
value of 1.000 were predicted to reach 99.80 and 80.16% for the leaching
efficiencies of vanadium and chromium, respectively. In Table 3, the results showed great agreement
between the simulated predicted results and experimental results,
which confirmed the validity of the model in simulating the leaching
process of vanadium and chromium from vanadium–chromium residues.

3 Conclusions
In this
study, the effects of six processing parameters (dosage of
NaOH, dosage of H2O2, reaction temperature,
liquid-to-solid ratio, stirring rate, and reaction time) on the leaching
efficiencies of vanadium and chromium from vanadium–chromium
residues were studied. The optimal processing parameters were obtained
from RSM.(1) The
leaching efficiency of vanadium was significantly affected by the
dosage of NaOH and dosage of H2O2 during the
experiments. The leaching efficiency of vanadium was up to 98.60%
at optimum technological parameters: dosage of NaOH of 0.70 g/g, dosage
of H2O2 of 0.70 mL/g, reaction time of 60 min,
reaction temperature of 60 °C, stirring rate of 550 rpm, and
liquid-to-solid ratio of 4 mL/g.

(2) The optimal processing parameters were obtained from
RSM, and the influence of processing parameters on the obtained rate
response followed the order: dosage of H2O2 (F)
> reaction temperature (C) > dosage of NaOH (A) > reaction
time (B) > stirring rate (D) > liquid-to-solid ratio (E). Under
the optimal conditions, the leaching efficiency of chromium was 79.82%:
dosage of NaOH of 0.99 g/g, dosage of H2O2 of
0.90 mL/g, reaction time of 84 min, reaction temperature of 70 °C,
stirring rate of 300 rpm, and liquid-to-solid ratio of 2.5 mL/g.



4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
The vanadium–chromium residue was
collected
from Pangang Group Co., Ltd., Chengdu, China. Also, it was precipitated
from waste water containing vanadium and chromium in low valence from
an iron and steel mill. The residue was dried and ground to fine particles
before experiments. The chemical composition of the residue is given
in detail in the references.21

4.2 Experimental Procedure
All experiments were conducted
in a thermostatic mixing water bath
pot. Before
the experiments, a predetermined concentration of NaOH solution was
added to the beaker, and then the residue was added as the appropriate
temperature was reached. Then, H2O2 was manually
added. The leachate was obtained by vacuum filtration after a required
time. The detailed processes can be seen in the refs21, 22, 31. The concentrations
of vanadium and chromium in the filtrate were determined by inductively
coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry.18,32−34 The leaching
efficiencies of vanadium (ηV) and chromium (ηCr) are calculated in eqs 3 and 4, respectively, as follows 3   4  where CV and CCr are the concentrations (g/L)
of vanadium and chromium in the filtrate, respectively; V is the volume (mL) of the leachate; ωV and ωCr are the mass fractions of vanadium and chromium in the residue,
respectively; and m (g) is the mass of the vanadium–chromium
residue used in the leaching experiments.

4.3 Experimental
Optimization
The experiment
design and optimization methods were according to the reference.23 Central composite design (CCD) was applied to
analyze the effect of processing parameters on the leaching efficiencies
of vanadium and chromium from the vanadium–chromium residue.
The operation processing parameters included the dosage of NaOH, dosage
of H2O2, reaction time, reaction temperature,
stirring rate, and liquid-to-solid ratio. The actual values for each
processing parameter are given in detail in Table 4.
