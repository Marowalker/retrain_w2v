The application of
graphene in the field of drug delivery has attracted
massive interest among researchers. However, the high toxicity of
graphene has been a drawback for its use in drug delivery. Therefore,
to enhance the biocompatibility of graphene, a new route was developed
using ternary natural deep eutectic solvents (DESs) as functionalizing
agents, which have the capability to incorporate various functional
groups and surface modifications. Physicochemical characterization
analyses, including field emission scanning electron microscope, fourier-transform
infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, Brunauer−Emmett−Teller,
X-ray diffraction, and energy dispersive X-ray, were used to verify
the surface modifications introduced by the functionalization process.
Doxorubicin was loaded onto the DES-functionalized graphene. The results
exhibited significantly improved drug entrapment efficiency (EE) and
drug loading capacity (DLC) compared with pristine graphene and oxidized
graphene. Compared with unfunctionalized graphene, functionalization
with DES choline chloride (ChCl):sucrose:water (4:1:4) resulted in
the highest drug loading capacity (EE of 51.84% and DLC of 25.92%)
followed by DES ChCl:glycerol:water (1:2:1) (EE of 51.04% and DLC
of 25.52%). Following doxorubicin loading, graphene damaged human
breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) through the generation of intracellular
reactive oxygen species (>95%) and cell cycle disruption by increase
in the cell population at S phase and G2/M phase. Thus, DESs represent
promising green functionalizing agents for nanodrug carriers. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first time that DES-functionalized
graphene has been used as a nanocarrier for doxorubicin, illustrating
the potential application of DESs as functionalizing agents in drug
delivery systems.

==== Body
Introduction
Doxorubicin (DOX; also known as adriamycin)
is an effective antineoplastic
chemotherapy drug that is normally applied to treat breast cancer.
DOX has been used in the treatment of various other cancers, including
acute lymphocytic leukemia, Kaposi’s sarcoma, osteogenic sarcomas,
bladder cancer, and lymphoma.1−5 However, there is a need to improve conventional delivery of DOX,
which lacks efficiency and selectivity against cancerous cells.6 Systemic delivery of DOX is highly critical to
enhance the therapeutic application of DOX.

Development of noninvasive
drug administration approaches is a
growing interest in drug delivery studies. In this context, several
important issues arise in the field of drug delivery, namely, drug
efficacy, selectivity of drugs between cancerous and normal cells,
and limited cellular entry of drugs.7−9 Nanodrug carriers represent
an alternative way of increasing the efficiency of drug delivery as
well as the pharmaceutical activity of drugs.10,11 Therefore, currently, the development of novel nanodrug carriers,
which is currently known as nanomedicine, is a focal point in modern
medicine.

Since its discovery, graphene has been widely explored
in various
fields, including electronics, engineering, biomedicine, and chemistry.12−14 Graphene has a two-dimensional (2-D) structure comprised of sp2 hybridized carbon atoms with delocalized π electrons
on their planar aromatic rings.12,15 Graphene has a large
surface area, high biocompatibility, high intrinsic mobility, high
Young’s modulus (elastic modulus), and high thermal stability.
Recently, graphene has been introduced as a potential nanocarrier
for drug loading via π-π stacking and hydrophobic and
electrostatic interactions.16 Because of
its high surface area, graphene can provide multiple attachment sites
for drug targeting. Graphene has higher drug loading capacity (i.e.,
up to a 200% loading ratio of loaded drug weight to vehicle) compared
with other nanodrug carrier systems, such as single-walled carbon
nanotubes.15 Graphene has been used as
a nanocarrier for numerous bioactive compounds and drugs, such as
ibuprofen, DOX, heparin, ellagic acid, 5-fluorouracil, and camptothecin.13,17,18 However, there is speculation
that graphene is potentially toxic to humans and the environment.12 Aggregation or flocculation of graphene on cell
membranes is presumed to play a primary role in its cellular toxicity.19,20 Therefore, it is important to modify the surface chemistry of graphene,
which may improve the biocompatibility of graphene with cells and
biological macromolecules.

Functionalization is a process that
includes the addition of new
functional groups to the surface of the nanoparticles through chemical
or physical attachment.21 However, there
are some adverse concerns regarding the conventional functionalization
agents (e.g., poly(ethylene glycol) and poly lactic-co-glycolic acid), such as involving a multistep and complicated procedure,
time consumption, requirement of high temperature (above 100 °C),
and use of a highly corrosive solution, resulting in high cost of
the whole process.22−26

Over the past decade, deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have been
deemed
to be promising green multitasking solvents for replacing hazardous
organic solvents in many applications. DES was introduced by Abbott
et al.27 as a eutectic mixture prepared
through a complexation of two or more Lewis or Brønsted acids
and bases that has a lower melting point than its single components.28 DESs have been used in numerous chemical and
biochemical applications.28−33 One of these is for their role as promising functionalizing agents
for carbon nanomaterials.34,35 The functionalization
using DESs may lead to surface modifications and introduce new functional
groups, which result in significant enhancement in the dispersion
stability of the aqueous solutions containing carbon nanomaterials.
The improved biocompatibility of graphene has been witnessed by the
interaction between DES-functionalized graphene and biological organelles
in cells.36 Interestingly, the functionalization
using DESs significantly alleviated cytotoxicity levels of graphene
against human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7), gastric cancer (AGS),
and macrophage (RAW264.7) cell lines, with a higher IC50 (i.e., >200 μg/mL) compared with pristine graphene and
oxidized
graphene. Nevertheless, to date, there are no studies on the DOX loading
capacity of DES-functionalized nanomaterials. Therefore, for the first
time, this study reports on the DOX loading capacity of DES-functionalized
graphene and its anticancer activities against MCF-7.

Methodologies
Preparation
of DESs
Choline chloride (ChCl) (purity
≥98%) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Glycerol (purity 99.8%)
was obtained from R&M Chemicals. Sucrose and urea (purity ∼99.5%)
were provided by Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Potassium permanganate
(KMnO4) with a purity of 99% was purchased from Univar.
Doxorubicin (hydrochloride) with a purity of ≥98% was obtained
from Cayman Chemical. Synthesis of DES ChCl:sucrose:water (4:1:4)
and DES ChCl:glycerol:water (1:2:1) was according to a previous report.37 First, all solid chemicals listed in Table 1 were dried overnight
in a vacuum oven (Memmert VO500, ThermoFisher) at 60 °C. Next,
the salt and HBDs were mixed according to the given molar ratio at
70 °C via magnetic stirring until a homogeneous solution was
achieved. The resulting mixture was then transferred into a well-sealed
and dark (covered with aluminum foil) bottle.

Preparation of Oxidized
Graphene and DES-Functionalized Graphene
Sixty-nanometer
flakes of graphene nanoplatelets (Gr) were provided
by Graphene Supermarket with a purity of 98.5%, a lateral particle
size of 3–7 μm, an average thickness of 7 nm, and a specific
surface area of <15 m2/g. Oxidation and functionalization
of Gr were performed as previously reported.34 Briefly, pristine graphene (PrGr) was dried overnight at 100 °C
under vacuum to remove impurities (e.g., water). Oxidized Gr (OxGr)
was prepared as a graphene pretreatment prior to the subsequent functionalization
process. The dried PrGr was oxidized using a 1.0 M KMnO4 solution and sonicated using an ultrasonic bath at 70 °C for
3 h. OxGr was washed with distilled water several times and filtered
using a PTFE membrane (pore size: 0.45 μm) and a vacuum pump
until the filtrate solution became transparent and neutral (i.e.,
pH = 7). OxGr was collected and dried in a vacuum oven. In the functionalization
procedure, the dried OxGr was mixed with DES and sonicated using an
ultrasonic bath at 70 °C for 3 h. Similar to the oxidation procedure,
the DES-functionalized Gr was subsequently washed with distilled water
and filtered until a clear and neutral solution was obtained. The
collected DES-functionalized Gr was then dried in the vacuum oven. Table 1 shows the composition
and molar ratios of the DESs as well as the abbreviations used for
the DES-functionalized Gr samples.

Physicochemical Characterization
Changes in morphology
of the Gr samples were observed using a Quant FEG 450 field emission
scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM). An energy dispersive X-ray
(EDX) analysis using an Oxford Inca 400 spectrometer was conducted
to determine surface elements of PrGr, OxGr, and DES-functionalized
Gr samples. DES-functionalized Gr samples were analyzed by FTIR using
a Perkin Elmer 1600 FTIR spectrometer. The samples were measured in
the range of 450–4000 wavenumbers. Raman spectra were recorded
using a Renishaw System 2000 Raman spectrometer under a wavelength
of 514 nm. The surface area of the samples was analyzed from the nitrogen
adsorption–desorption isotherm at 77 K based on the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method using the automatic Micromeritics ASAP-2020, TRISTAR
II 3020 Kr. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis also was performed.

Doxorubicin Loading
PrGr, OxGr, and DES-functionalized
Gr samples were added to DMSO (100 μg/mL) and vortexed until
completely dispersed. Next, 50 μg/mL DOX was dissolved in DMSO
and vortexed. Both solutions were mixed and sonicated for 15 min using
a Branson 2800 ultrasonic bath. Subsequently, the mixture was agitated
at 28 °C for 12 h using an orbital shaker ES-20 (Grant-Bio, UK).
Next, the mixture was centrifuged at 14 000 rpm for 30 min
using an ultracentrifuge (Hermle Z233 MK-2, Lausanne). The pellet
(i.e., DOX-loaded Gr) was collected, dried in a vacuum oven, and stored
at −20 °C (Lab Dryer, Protech). The supernatant was measured
at a wavelength of 480 nm using the Synergy HTX multimode reader (Biotek).
Entrapment efficiency % (EE) and drug loading capacity % (DLC) were
determined by measuring unbound drug in the supernatant at an absorbance
peak of 480 nm and using eqs 1 and 2.38 1   2  where EE is the entrapment efficiency, DLC
is the drug loading capacity, and W is the weight.

DOX-loaded graphene samples were labeled as follows: DOX-PrGr,
DOX-OxGr, DOX-SWGr, and DOX-GlyWGr.

Cell Culture
The
human breast cancer cell line MCF-7
was obtained from Cell Lines Service (Eppelgeim, Germany, 3000273),
while macrophages (RAW264.7) were purchased from American Type Cell
Collection (ATCC). MCF-7 was cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute
(RPMI) medium supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine
serum (FBS) and a 1% mixture of streptomycin and penicillin. RAW264.7
cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% streptomycin and penicillin.
Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified
incubator and were subcultured within 2–3 days.

Cell Viability
The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) (Sigma-Aldrich) cell viability assay was performed according
to the method of Hayyan et al.,39 with
slight modifications. First, the cells (1.5 × 104 per
well) were seeded into 96-well plates (Corning) and incubated for
24 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator. The
DOX-loaded Gr samples were added the next day, followed by a 24 h
incubation. Next, the supernatant was replaced with fresh medium (to
avoid any interference), followed by addition of 2 mg/mL MTT reagent.
After a 2 h incubation, the MTT reagent was discarded and later added
with 100% DMSO. Absorbance was then measured at 570 nm. The percentage
of cell viability was calculated with respect to untreated cells (eq 3). The 50% inhibitory concentration
(IC50) was determined using Graph Pad Prism 5 software. 3  where a is the absorbance
of treated cells and b is the absorbance of untreated
cells.

Cell Cycle Progression
The effects of DOX-loaded Gr
samples on the cell cycle of MCF-7 cells were measured using a flow
cytometer. After 24 h of treatment, cells were harvested then fixed
with 70% cold ethanol, followed by overnight incubation at −80
°C. Next, cells were washed and suspended in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS). Cells were stained with 200 μL of propidium iodide/ribonuclease
A (RNase A) for 1 h at 37 °C; then, the DNA content was evaluated
using a flow cytometer (BD FACSCantoII).

Reactive Oxygen Species
(ROS)
Reactive oxygen species
(ROS) generation was measured as previously described.40 After cells were treated with DOX-loaded Gr
samples for 24 h, dihydroethidium (DHE) dye was added into the live
culture for 30 min. The cells were then fixed and washed with wash
buffer (i.e., PBS). The percentage of cells with ROS were analyzed
using the flow cytometer BD FACSCantoII (BD Biosciences).

Statistical
Analysis
Values were expressed as mean
± standard deviation of three replicate measurements and were
subjected to one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Significance differences
were determined using the Duncan test at the 95% confidence level
(P < 0.05). Analyses were performed using SigmaPlot
11.

Results and Discussion
Physicochemical Characterization
Sample morphology
was observed using FE-SEM to visualize the effect of DES functionalization
on the structure of the Gr samples. Figure 1 shows FE-SEM images of (a) PrGr, (b) OxGr,
(c) SWGr, and (d) GlyWGr. As observed in Figure 1b, significant deformation occurred after
oxidation of PrGr. These types of structural deformation may improve
the dispersibility of Gr and can also be useful for the preparation
of functionalization.34 After functionalization
of the DESs, the deformed structure of the OxGr disappeared. This
suggests that Gr structure was restored by the addition of functional
groups from the DESs. However, no significant difference between the
structure of SWGr and GlyWGr was observed.

Figure 1 FE-SEM images of (a)
PrGr, (b) OxGr, (c) SWGr, and (d) GlyWGr.

BET analysis was conducted for PrGr, OxGr, and DES-functionalized
Gr to elucidate the effect of DES functionalization on the surface
area of the Gr structure. Table 2 demonstrates a slight increase in the surface area
of Gr after oxidation by KMnO4, from 14.65 to 15.06 m2/g. This is in accordance with the previous studies conducted
on the oxidation of various carbon-based nanomaterials by different
oxidizing agents.41,42 However, smaller BET surface
areas were observed after DES functionalization. This can be ascribed
to the healing or recovering effects on the deformed structure of
OxGr through the addition of functional groups, such as oxygen- and
amine-containing functional groups. This supports the result of FE-SEM
analysis where the deformed structure of the OxGr disappeared after
DES functionalization.

As expected, carbon
was the only surface element identified for
PrGr in the EDX analysis (Table 3). Mild oxidation by KMnO4 solution introduced
new elements onto the surface of the Gr, including 4.73% oxygen (O),
0.46% potassium (K), and 2.99% manganese (Mn). Additional new surface
elements appeared following SWGr and GlyWGr, i.e., chlorine (Cl) and
nitrogen (N), which were not observed for unfunctionalized Gr samples
(Table 3). This clearly
can be ascribed to the use of ChCl-based DESs. In comparison with
PrGr, the presence of these additional surface elements (i.e., O,
K, Mn, Cl, and N) corroborated completion of the oxidation and DES
functionalization processes. Hence, this also confirmed the presence
of DES functional groups on the surface of Gr.

GlyWGr	92.64	4.00	0.18	2.52	0.19	0.48	
Significant
changes in the FTIR spectra of Gr samples after DES
functionalization were observed. Figure 2 shows that amine-based functional groups
were detected in the GlyWGr and SWGr, including aliphatic isonitrile
−N≡C stretching, aliphatic C-N stretching, aromatic
isonitrile −N≡C stretching, NH2 wagging and
twisting, and secondary amide N-H wagging. DES-functionalized Grs
also displayed several peaks that represented oxygen-based functional
groups, such as O-H stretching, aliphatic aldehyde C=O stretching,
C-O-H in-plane bending, and C-O stretching (Figure 2). As compared with a recent study from our
group,36 these amine- and oxygen-based
functional groups were not identified in the FTIR spectra of PrGr.
This is in good agreement with the EDX result that showed that additional
surface elements such as N and O were introduced after functionalization
with DES ChCl:glycerol:water (1:2:1) and ChCl:sucrose:water (4:1:4).
These results suggested that DES functionalization may enhance the
hydrophilicity of graphene through the introduction of additional
functional groups such as amine- and oxygen-based functional groups.
This is supported by previous studies34,35 in which DES-functionalized
carbon nanomaterials demonstrated better dispersion stability in aqueous
media compared with unfunctionalized Gr.

Figure 2 FTIR spectra of (a) GlyWGr
and (b) SWGr.

A previous study36 reported that the
XRD pattern of PrGr contained several prominent peaks at 2θ
= 26.33, 42.07, 44.62, 49.14, 54.19, and 72.69°, which indicate
the crystalline planes (002), (100), (101), (012), (004), and (014),
respectively. The same crystalline planes were observed in DES-functionalized
Grs, which implied that the structural integrity of Gr was maintained
even after DES functionalization (Figure 3). However, a significant shift was observed
in the diffraction peaks identified on the XRD patterns of SWGr and
GlyWGr (Table 4), especially
for the crystalline planes (002) at 2θ = 26.33° that shifted
to 26.63 and 26.61°, respectively. The peak intensities of Grs
were also reduced for the crystalline planes (002), (100), (012),
(004), and (014) after the oxidation and DES functionalization process
(Table 4). As discussed
in previous studies,43−45 the same outcome was observed as effects of functionalization
on the XRD patterns of the carbon nanomaterials.

Raman
spectra of PrGr identified three distinguished peaks that
represent 2D band (2700 cm–1), G band (1580 cm–1), and D band (1350 cm–1).36 The G band is essentially related to the formation
of sp2-bonded hybridized carbon, while the 2D band is generally
associated with sp3 hybridization of the graphitic structure.46,47 The intensity ID/IG ratio of OxGr was significantly higher than that of PrGr
(Table 5), which was
due to the introduction of oxygenated functional groups after the
oxidation process that increased structural deformation of Gr.46 However, after DES functionalization, the ID/IG ratio was reduced,
due to the increase in the intensity of the G band (Figure 4). This implied that the addition
of functional groups by DES functionalization restored the sp2 hybridization on the structure of Gr. As discussed previously,
the FTIR spectra of DES-functionalized Grs confirmed the presence
of new functional groups in SWGr and GlyWGr, especially amine-based
functional groups that were not identified in PrGr and OxGr.

Doxorubicin
Loading
To determine the amount of DOX
loaded on the Gr samples, the amount of unbound DOX in solution was
measured by an absorbance peak at 480 nm. Overall, all samples (i.e.,
PrGr, OxGr, and DES-functionalized Gr samples) interacted with DOX,
as demonstrated by the decrease in the absorbance of DOX spectra after
12 h of incubation (Figure 5). A significant reduction in the spectra of absorption intensity
of DOX was observed for SWGr and GlyWGr. This indicated the loading
of DOX onto SWGr and GlyWGr was higher than PrGr and OxGr.

Figure 5 UV–vis
spectra of doxorubicin solution (50 μg/mL)
and mixture of doxorubicin (50 μg/mL) with Gr samples (100 μg/mL).

The EE and DLC using PrGr, OxGr, SWGr, and GlyWGr
as DOX carriers
were evaluated and are listed in Table 6. OxGr showed an insignificant difference compared
with PrGr. The EE and DLC for both samples were approximately equivalent.
On the other hand, the DES functionalization of Gr using ChCl:S:W
and ChCl:Gly:W influenced the amount of DOX loaded. This can be confirmed
by significant increase of EE and DLC following both functionalization
as compared with unfunctionalized Gr (i.e., PrGr and OxGr), Table 6. The use of SWGr
as a DOX carrier exhibited the highest EE (51.84%) and DLC (25.92%),
followed by GlyWGr (EE 51.04% and DLC 25.52%). Notably, the EE using
both SWGr and GlyWGr was higher as compared to chitosan nanoparticle
formulations, namely, Type B gelatin (EE: 8.4%), glucomannan (EE:
9.3%), polyphosphoric acid (EE: 12.2%), and dextran sulfate-incorporated
chitosan nanoparticles (EE: 21.9%).48 In
addition, the DLC using SWGr and GlyWGr was considerably higher in
comparison to polymer micelle carrier systems such as poly(ethylene
glycol)–poly(β-benzyl-L-aspartate) copolymer
micelles that had a DLC ranging from 15 to 20%.49 These DES-functionalized Gr systems also exhibited a higher
DLC compared with glyceryl caprate-curdlan solid lipid nanoparticles
(DLC of 2.8%).50 Unlike other drug carriers,
graphene is a superior nanodrug carrier, as both sides of a graphene
sheet are accessible for drug loading/binding via a physical adsorption
mechanism.51,52 The presence of π electrons
on graphitic domains promotes the formation of noncovalent binding
via π-π stacking interactions with various compounds or
substances, including DOX.17,53−55 These π electrons on the plane immobilized DOX via noncovalent
physical adsorption (physisorption).15 In
addition to the π–π electron stacking interactions,
DES-functionalized Gr may also form strong hydrogen bonds with DOX.
This is because the presence of DES functional groups on the surface
of Gr may promote hydrogen-bonding interactions between DES-functionalized
Gr and DOX.56,57 The combined effect of these
two interactions (i.e., π–π stacking and hydrogen
bonding) may impart SWGr and GlyWGr with a higher drug loading capacity
compared with unfunctionalized Gr. As shown by EDX analysis, SWGr
and GlyWGr identified surface elements such as O and N permit the
presence of functional groups that may form hydrogen bonds with DOX.
This feature likely contributed to the higher DOX loading capacity
of SWGr and GlyWGr.

Cytotoxicity Analysis
The cytotoxic effect of free
loaded-Gr and DOX-loaded-Gr samples on cell viability was studied
using the MTT cell viability assay, particularly with MCF-7 and RAW264.7
cell lines (Table 7). Table 7 shows that
SWGr exhibited a lower IC50 than GlyWGr on both MCF-7 and
RAW264.7 cells (284.20 and 363.03 μg/mL, respectively), indicating
that the toxicity of SWGr was higher than that of GlyWGr (443.05 and
476.80 μg/mL, respectively). Compared with a previous study,36 the toxicity of SWGr and GlyWGr for both MCF-7
and RAW264.7 cells was significantly lower than that of PrGr and OxGr.
This implied that functionalization of graphene using DESs (i.e.,
ChCl:S:W and ChCl:Gly:W) was effective in reducing the cytotoxicity
of graphene, especially using DES ChCl:Gly:W as a functionalizing
agent.

demonstrated the lowest IC50 toward MCF-7 (IC50 of 26.49 μg/mL), followed by the following sequence:
DOX-SWGr (IC50 of 34.15 μg/mL) < DOX-PrGr (IC50 of 34.72 μg/mL) < DOX-GlyWGr (IC50 of
61.46 μg/mL) < SWGr (IC50 of 284.20 μg/mL)
< GlyWGr (IC50 of 443.05 μg/mL). The same trend
was observed with the RAW264.7 cell line, in which DOX-OxGr (IC50 of 130.8 μg/mL) exhibited the lowest IC50 compared with DOX-SWGr (IC50 of 234.87 μg/mL) <
DOX-PrGr (IC50 of 300.75 μg/mL) < DOX-GlyWGr (IC50 of 332.63 μg/mL) < SWGr (IC50 of 363.03
μg/mL) < GlyWGr (IC50 of 476.80 μg/mL).
The combined cytotoxic effect of OxGr and DOX was highly toxic toward
both cells. Unlike DOX-loaded DES-functionalized Gr, the high cytotoxicity
of DOX-OxGr against macrophage cells (i.e., RAW264.7 cells) is somehow
unfavorable for the drug delivery system.

Compared with the
free loaded-SWGr and -GlyWGr, there was a considerable
increase in the toxicity of DOX-SWGr and DOX-GlyWGr compared with
free loaded Gr (Table 7). The toxicity of these DOX-loaded-Gr samples was significantly
higher compared with previous studies of free loaded Gr.36,58 In comparison with other graphene-based DOX carriers, multifunctional
graphene oxide drug carriers named GO/PEI.Ac-FI-PEG-LA at various
concentrations (0.5, 1, 2, and 4 μM) exhibited higher cell inhibition
than free loaded Gr (i.e., approximately 50% inhibition).59 This higher toxicity of DOX-loaded Gr compared
with free loaded Gr indicated that the lethal interaction between
graphene and cells was significantly increased when DOX was loaded
onto graphene. The significant detrimental effects of DOX-SWGr and
DOX-GlyWGr also can be identified via optical microscopy at 40×
and 100× magnification, as shown in Figure 6. Cell confluency was significantly reduced
relative to untreated MCF-7. Changes in the size and morphology of
MCF-7 were observed after being treated with DOX-SWGr and DOX-GlyWGr.

Figure 6 Untreated
MCF-7 cells at (a) 40× and (b) 100× magnification,
DOX-GlyWGr-treated MCF-7 at (c) 40× and (d) 100× magnification,
and DOX-SWGr-treated MCF-7 at (e) 40× and (f) 100× magnification.

On the selectivity index of the nanocarriers, RAW264.7
cells were
used as nontargeted cells due to the importance of macrophages in
the immune system for human defense. The selectivity index was determined
as the ratio of the sample’s IC50 on cancerous cells
over their IC50 on nontargeted cells. Table 7 shows that DOX-PrGr exhibited
the highest selectivity index against MCF-7 cells with 7.81, followed
by DOX-SWGr (6.88), DOX-GlyWGr (5.41), and DOX-OxGr (4.94). The selectivity
index of DOX-SWGr and DOX-GlyWGr was significantly increased compared
with the free loaded-SWGr (1.28) and -GlyWGr (1.08). These levels
of selectivity are considered to be significantly higher compared
with other synthetic anticancer drugs, such as piperidinyl-diethylstilbestrol,
pyrrolidinyl-diethylstilbestrol, alisiaquinol, and 4-hydroxy tamoxifen,
which were reported to possess a selectivity index < 2.00.60,61 Although DOX-PrGr showed higher selectivity against the MCF-7 cell
line, its toxicity toward RAW264.7 cells was significantly high. The
aforementioned high toxicity against macrophages is undesirable for
anticancer drugs. Drugs that possess high cytotoxicity against macrophages
may cause deterioration of the human immune system. Therefore, GlyWGr
is a potential carrier for DOX that has mild cytotoxicity against
macrophage cells.

Gr samples at their respective IC50 were tested in ROS
and cell cycle analysis assays to further elucidate mechanisms of
cell death after exposure to DOX-loaded Gr. The use of the IC50 concentration may better reflect cell death mechanisms,
as 50% of the cells are inhibited at this concentration.

Reactive Oxygen
Species (ROS) Generation
One of the
cell death mechanisms caused by DOX involves the generation of ROS,
which lead to cellular oxidative damage.62−64 Previous studies65,66 deconvoluted several mechanisms of DOX-mediated ROS stimulation,
including one that involves an enzymatic pathway that is coupled with
the mitochondrial respiratory chain and also a nonenzymatic mechanism
that uses iron. Several enzymes, namely, NAD(P)H dehydrogenase, cytochrome
p450, and nitric oxide synthase, have been speculated to initiate
metabolic oxidation via the reductive effect of DOX.67,68 In addition, DOX also may induce release of calcium from internal
stores that leads to stimulation of ROS and interruption of cellular
redox balance.62

Figure 7 demonstrates that the peaks
shift to the right (i.e., greater fluorescence intensity), indicating
an increase of ROS generation by all DOX-loaded-Gr samples compared
with untreated cells. This indicates that the Gr samples were able
to retain one of the DOX anticancer properties (i.e., ROS generation).
This result is in agreement with poly(γ-benzyl-L-glutamate)-block-hyaluronan (PBLG-b-HYA)-based polymersomes,
which also retained the ROS generation behavior of DOX.69 DOX-OxGr possessed the highest level of ROS
generation (99.3%) followed by DOX-GlyWGr (99.1%). DOX-loaded-Gr also
exhibited higher ROS generation compared with free loaded-Gr (i.e.,
SWGr 80.0% and GlyWGr 69.0%). These levels of ROS generation were
significantly higher compared with unloaded graphene samples from
various graphene-based compounds, such as oxygenated graphene, aggregated
graphene, graphene oxide, and nitric oxide-functionalized graphene.70−73 This demonstrated that loading of DOX onto graphene increased intracellular
ROS generation. These ROS generation results also aligned with the
cell viability analysis, where DOX-OxGr and DOX-SWGr exhibited the
most destructive effects toward MCF-7 cells compared with DOX-PrGr
and DOX-GlyWGr. This confirms the role of DOX-induced ROS generation
in cancer cell death was significant, which is in agreement with previous
studies63,74−76 regarding the critical
role of ROS in anticancer activities toward various cancerous cells.
For example, Tsang et al.77 demonstrated
that increased intracellular ROS generation, namely, superoxide and
hydrogen peroxide, resulted in cell death of the human osteosarcoma
cell line.

(d) DOX-PrGr, (e) DOX-OxGr, (f) DOX-SWGr, and (g) DOX-GlyWGr-treated
MCF-7. Data are representative of three independent experiments.

Cell Cycle Disruption
One of the
strategies used for
developing anticancer agents is modulating progression of the cell
cycle. Therefore, propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry analysis
of the treated MCF-7 cells was conducted to elucidate the impact of
DOX-loaded-Gr on cell cycle phases. Figure 8 shows that free loaded Gr and DOX-loaded-Gr
(i.e., PrGr, OxGr, SWGr, and GlyWGr) disrupted cell cycle progression
of the MCF-7 cell line. Untreated MCF-7 cells (as a control) had 55.4%
of their cell population in G0/G1 phase, 23.4% in S phase, and 20.3%
in G2/M phase. SWGr and GlyWGr mildly disrupted progression of the
cell cycle (Figure 8). On the other hand, DOX-loaded-PrGr, -OxGr, -SWGr, and -GlyWGr
arrested the cells at S phase and G2/M phase (i.e., increased the
number of cells at S phase and G2/M phase) and consequently impeded
cell cycle progression. Significant cell arrest at S phase and G2/M
phase was observed with DOX-GlyWGr, with 40% of the cell population
at S phase and 28.4% at G2/M phase, compared with untreated MCF-7
cells (i.e., S phase: 23.4% and G2/M phase: 20.3% of the cell population).
As shown in Figure 9, the G2 checkpoint permits the cells to repair DNA damage before
proceeding into the mitosis phase. The significant amount of DNA damage
that occurs in the cells may lead to a higher number of cells arrested
at the G2/M phase. DOX-induced DNA damage is believed to predominantly
occur at the G2/M phase.78 Cell arrest
at the G2/M checkpoint may cause cancer cells to undergo apoptosis
and subsequently increase the destructive effects. This incident is
in accordance with previous studies79,80 of various
types of cancer cell lines. The results also showed an obvious relationship
between ROS and cell cycle mechanisms in which the increase of intracellular
ROS by DOX-loaded Gr led to disruption of cell cycle progression.
As studied previously,64,81,82 a high level of ROS can cause cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, especially
for DOX-mediated cell death.

experiments.

Conclusions
This study confirmed
that DES-functionalized graphene samples (i.e.,
SWGr and GlyWGr) were able to increase the DOX loading capacity compared
with PrGr and OxGR. This was due to surface modification of Gr by
DESs ChCl:S:W and ChCl:Gly:W. After DOX loading, the drug-loaded-Grs
(i.e., DOX-SWGr and DOX-GlyWGr) were more toxic against MCF-7 cells
than free loaded-Gr (i.e., SWGr and GlyWGr). However, DOX-SWGr exhibited
higher anticancer activity (IC50 of 34.15 μg/mL)
and higher selectivity (index value of 6.88) against MCF-7 cells compared
with DOX-GlyWGr (IC50 of 61.46 μg/mL, index value
of 5.41). DOX-SWGr and DOX-GlyWGr also had destructive effects against
the MCF-7 cell line through the generation of intracellular ROS and
cell cycle disruption. Overall, SWGr and GlyWGr represented promising
nanocarriers for DOX because of their high toxicity against breast
cancer cells.
