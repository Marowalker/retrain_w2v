G-quadruplexes (G4s) are unique four-stranded
nucleic acid secondary
structures formed by G-rich nucleic acid sequences which are prevalent
in gene promoter and telomere regions and deemed to play essential
roles in many biological and pathological processes. Although attentions
to G4s have been paid for nearly 40 years, G4 selectivity and its
topology discrimination in cells is still pending. Small fluorescence
molecules are emerging as a versatile tool of interrogation of cellular
features in vivo. Herein, a new class of bis(4-aminobenzylidene)acetone
derivatives GD1, GD2, and GD3 with excellent environment-sensitive
emission properties were developed and used for fluorescent detection
of G4s. Among them, compound GD3 owning four methoxy groups presented
preferable capability of lighting up parallel G4s with a strong red-emission
enhancement. The photophysical property of GD3 was systematically
investigated to elucidate the turn-on mechanism of GD3 toward parallel
G4 structures, which reveal that the binding-induced polarity change
of the microenvironment around GD3 together with the fluorophore conformational
confinement affected the molecular intramolecular charge-transfer
state and resulted the enhanced emission. G4s staining with GD3 in
fixed cells was further applied, demonstrating GD3 a promising probe
with the ability to visualize the distribution of G4 structures in
biological processes. In general, this study provides a new potential
scaffold—bis(4-aminobenzylidene)acetone—for design of
G4-selective fluorescence probes.

Introduction
G-quadruplexes (G4s)
are a kind of distinctive nucleic acid secondary
structures, comprising two or more G-quartet blocks bound by Hoogsteen
hydrogen bonding in G-rich oligonucleotide sequences.1−3 G4 structures can be formed kinetically fast within one strand (intramolecular)
or from multiple strands (intermolecular) into extensive structural
morphologies depending on the characteristics of the sequences, loop
geometry, and local environment, and so forth. According to the orientation
of the DNA strands, the G4s are typically divided into three main
topologies including parallel, antiparallel, and hybrids thereof.4,5 Recent studies reveal that the G4 forming in human genome is prevalent
and responsible for a wide variety of functions including gene-expressing
regulation, RNA splicing and translation, telomere maintenance, and
so on.3−8 In line with their biological significance, G4-motifs are proposed
as new potential therapeutic targets against cancers and other diseases.9−12 For elaborating the structure–function relationships of G4s,
many analytical methods such as circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy,
gel-electrophoresis, DNA-foot printing assay, isothermal calorimetry
(ITC), mass spectrometry analysis, X-ray crystallography, and nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy have been employed in which
fluorescent imaging as a versatile noninvasive and visualized approach
has attracted special attentions.13 Under
this circumstance, specific G4 fluorescent probes with good biocompatibility
are essential tools for G4 imaging in vivo. During the last 20 years,
various G4 probes capable of binding and reporting G4 structures have
been reported.14,15 Among those, small fluorescence
probes usually perform superior signal output and affinities toward
G4s, such as thiazole orange and its analogues,16−20 cyanine dyes,21 heavy-metal
complexes,22−24 phthalocyanines,25 squaraines,26,27 and others.28,29 Developing new probes with specific
photo properties especially with red or near-infrared fluorescent
emission to distinguish different G4 topologies in vitro and mark
G4 structures in cells are still appealing and challenging.

Pyridodicarboxamide unit is a well-known building block for developing
efficient G4 ligands and drugs, which provides G4 ligands a crescent-shape
configuration and H-bonds network for G-quartet overlap.30−33 By inspiration with such structural and functional features,34 herein, we explored the possibility of bis(4-aminobenzylidene)acetone
as new G4 ligands by considering the resembling structure shape and
the multiple H-bond sites from the carbonyl and amino groups. Bis(4-aminobenzylidene)acetone
derivatives, owing to their good biocompatibility, pharmacokinetic
profile, and easy synthesis and modification properties, are widely
used in biological applications from anticancer or anti-inflammatory
drugs35,36 to radioactive probes.37,38 However, to the best of our knowledge, their applications as fluorescent
probes, especially in cells, have not been explored. The coexistence
of the central electron-withdrawing carbonyl moiety, the diene bridge,
and the extended pi-conjugated structure endows these compounds with
special photophysical properties39 such
as large excited-state dipole moment, distinct intramolecular charge
transfer (ICT) character, obvious solvatochromism effect, and microenvironmental
sensitivity, which makes bis(4-aminobenzylidene)acetone derivatives
becoming a kind of promising building blocks for fluorescent probes.
In this work, a new series of bis(4-aminobenzylidene)acetone derivatives
GD1, GD2, and GD3 with different numbers of ortho-methoxy groups (Scheme 1), which were attached
to regulate hydrogen bonding and morphological fitting for G4s binding,
were synthesized and characterized. The three compounds were nearly
fluorescence silent in aqueous solution but showed strong red emission
in organic solvents. On the basis of their obvious solvatochromism
properties, fluorescent screening assays for several kinds of oligonucleotide
structures were performed. The results showed that compound GD3 with
four methoxy groups presented a specific affinity to parallel G4s,
giving a much superior fluorescence response for G4 topology discrimination.

GD1, GD2, and GD3
Results and Discussion
The affinity of GD1, GD2 and
GD3 to G4s was first investigated
through a preliminary fluorescent screening assay with 10 different
oligonucleotide sequences including G4s (parallel G4s, anti-parallel
G4s, and hybrid G4s), single- and double-stranded DNA, as well as
triplex (the sequences and their corresponding secondary structures
are shown in Table S1) in Tris-HCl (10
mM, pH = 7.4) containing 50 mM KCl. The emission enhancements of the
three dyes (2 μM) after adding 0.5 equiv amount of different
sequences are shown in Figures 1 and S1. All of the three dyes
display very weak emissions with peaks around 600 nm initially. Addition
of the 10 sequences into the three dye solutions, respectively, induces
diverse fluorescence signal responses. Less than onefold enhancement
of emission intensity was detected in GD1 and GD2 solutions, no matter
which sequence was added. On the contrary, the emission of GD3 was
enhanced significantly after being treated with c-myc, c-kit2, VEGF,
and ADAM10 (RNA G4s), which had already been demonstrated to form
into parallel G4 structures in buffers with K+. Whereas
the addition of other oligonucleotide sequences, including hybrid
G4s (22AG), anti-parallel G4s (21CTA and TBA), and other single-,
double-stranded, and triplex DNA, hardly effected the emission of
GD3 under the same conditions. These fluorescence results showed that
compared to compounds GD1 and GD2, GD3 with four methoxy groups presented
the capability of discriminating parallel G4 structures in vitro.
Considering the structure differences between these dyes, it may be
inferred that the additional methoxy groups played a crucial role
in making GD3 an eligible ligand for parallel G4. The methoxy groups
may provide more hydrogen bond acceptors to form hydrogen bond with
a G-base and better morphologic fitness as well, and consequently
enhance the binding affinity to parallel G4 structures. The preferable
complexation of GD3 toward parallel G4s over antiparallel and hybrid
G4s may result from the steric hindrance of nonparallel G4s, where
dyes cannot efficiently stack on.

Figure 1 (A) Emission responses of GD1, GD2, and
GD3 at 600 nm and (B) emission
spectra of GD3 toward 0.5 equiv oligonucleotides of 10 different sequences
(1 μM) in Tris-HCl buffer (10 mM, pH = 7.4) containing 50 mM
KCl. GD1, GD2, and GD3 (2 μM) were severally incubated with
DNA at room temperature for 10 min, and the solutions were excited
at 450 nm.

The binding properties of GD3
against G4s were ascertained with
the following fluorescence titration assays. When excited at 450 nm,
the absorbance isosbestic point of GD3 solutions with and without
equimolar G4s (Figure S2), the plots of
the fluorescence intensity peaked at 600 nm as a function of oligonucleotide
concentrations are recorded and depicted in Figure 2A. GD3 presents weak fluorescence responses
to non-G4, anti-parallel, and hybrid G4 structures. However, the emission
intensity of GD3 shows apparent dose-dependent enhancements versus
the concentrations of the parallel G4 oligomers (c-myc, c-kit2, VEGF,
and ADAM10). Meanwhile, the enhanced emissions induced by four parallel
G4s are all accompanied with a slight hypsochromic shift of the emission
maximum (Figure S3). Although GD3 can respond
to all parallel G4s, the tendency of emission signal changes toward
different G4 sequences is quite different. An emission plateau was
first reached after adding equimolar VEGF, indicating that a GD3/VEGF
complex was formed with 1:1 stoichiometry. The dissociation constant
value (Kd) of GD3/VEGF complex was estimated
using a nonlinear fitting equation with a 1:1 binding model to be
3.03 μM, and the Kd value provides
the bis(4-aminobenzylidene)acetone derivative GD3 great potentials
as a functional parallel G4 ligand. For further investigation of the
application potential of GD3 in biosystems, the selectivity and anti-interference
performances of GD3 to parallel G4s were examined by recording the
fluorescence intensity changes of GD3/parallel G4s complexes in the
absence and presence of excess ds-DNA (0−20 equiv). Figure S4 shows that the fluorescence intensity
is barely affected by the added ds-DNA, indicative of excellent selectivity
and anti-interference performances of GD3 to parallel G4s.

oligonucleotides; (B) CD spectra of the four different parallel G4s
(5 μM) and their corresponding complexes with GD3 (5 μM),
in Tris-HCl buffer with 50 mM KCl (10 mM, pH = 7.4).

The topology stability of the parallel G4s with
GD3 was then analyzed
using CD spectroscopy. As depicted in Figure 2B, the typical CD signals of the parallel
G4s with a strong positive absorption at 265 nm and a negative one
at 240 nm are all conserved after addition of GD3, indicating that
GD3 binds to parallel G4s without affecting their initial topologies
which makes GD3 an ideal staining agent.42 To further investigate the binding mode of GD3 with parallel G4s,
ITC analysis as well as molecular modeling studies were carried out,
and the Kd value of GD3 to parallel G4-VEGF
was reported as 3.65 μM with one binding site by ITC (Figure S5), quite agreeing with the value determined
by fluorescence titration. The simulated binding site of GD3 in parallel
G4s is shown in Figure S7. The result indicates
that GD3 prefers to stack on one end (closing to 3′-terminal
surface) of parallel G4s with a binding free energy of −36.912
kJ mol–1, which is much lower than that of GD1 and
GD2 (estimated as −26.599 and −31.735 kJ mol–1, respectively), suggesting that the methoxy groups play key roles
in the regulation of the binding affinity between this scaffold and
parallel G4s which is mainly because of the improved H-bond forming
between the methoxy groups and G-bases as well as the morphologic
fitness to parallel G4 structures, and the end-stacking binding mode
was further confirmed by the G4/hemin inhibition results, as shown
in Figure S8.

The “light up”
mechanism of GD3 toward parallel G4s
was further investigated by fluorescence spectroscopy. There are possibly
three main reasons accounting for the emission changes of GD3 induced
by complexation with G4s, including changes of fluorophore aggregation
or dispersion state, influence on ICT process, and molecular conformation
planarity or confinement. These factors may exist lonely or synergistically
in different scenarios. The aggregation or dispersion state change
of GD3 was first excluded by the concentration- and temperature-dependent
absorption experiments (Figure S9). The
unchanged absorption spectrum of GD3 under heating and the linear
decrease of absorbance with dilution suggested that GD3 was molecularly
dispersed and chemically stable under the experimental condition as
well as during the binding procedure, indicative of the unchanged
physical state of GD3. The solvatochromism effect is a typical phenomenon
shown by a fluorophore with the ICT property; thus, GD3 was dissolved
into six solvents with different polarities, and the fluorescence
spectra of the solutions are recorded and shown in Figure 3A. The remarkable variation
of emission maximum in the six solvents with a positive solvatochromism
response identified GD3 as a typical ICT compound. The fluorescence
quantum yields (ΦF) of GD3 in organic solvents were
above 0.18, whereas the value sharply dropped to 0.003 in Tris-HCl
(10 mM, pH = 7.4). The mixture of methanol–Tris-HCl was chosen
for monitoring the emission changes of GD3 induced by subtle variations
of the solvent environment. Emission spectra in Figure 3B show that with increasing the proportion
of methanol in mixed solvent from 0 to 1, the emission of GD3 gradually
enhanced accompanied with a hypsochromic shift of 15 nm. The variation
tendency of the emission spectra of GD3 treated with increasing parallel
G4s resembles that with environmental polarity decreasing, indicating
that the complexation of GD3 with parallel G4s decreases the microenvironmental
polarity around GD3 and then enhances the emission. In addition, complexation
with G4s may introduce conformational confinement that will enhance
the chromophore emission. A viscosity-dependent emission assay was
carried out to evaluate the emission enhancement induced by molecular
conformation confinement. Glycerol–methanol mixtures were used
as the dispersant media of different viscosities, and the emission
spectra of GD3 therein are recorded and shown in Figure S10. With increasing the fraction of glycerol and the
consequent medium viscosity, the emission of GD3 was gradually enhanced,
which is attributed to the restrained intramolecular rotation and
nonradiative decay in high-viscosity medium. Therefore, taking account
of these photophysical results, the lighting-up mechanism of GD3 toward
parallel G4s can be mainly ascribed to the binding-induced polarity
change of the microenvironment around GD3, which enhances the emission
of GD3 ICT state. Meanwhile, the conformational confinement of the
fluorophore also synergistically contributes to the sensing signal.

kinds of solvents with different polarities; (B) fluorescence spectra
of GD3 (2 μM) in the mixtures of methanol and Tris-HCl with
different ratios (Inset: the emission maximum wavelength of GD3 at
different methanol fractions).

The intracellular application of GD3 as a selective parallel
G4
staining ligand in ARPE-19 cell lines was investigated as follows.
The confocal fluorescence images of methanol-fixed ARPE-19 cells costained
with GD3 and nuclear-localized dye Hoechst 33258 (Figure 4A–C) showed that bright-red
emission spots appeared in certain regions of nucleus, coinciding
with the areas of nucleoli.43 Besides,
red emission signals also distributed in some cytoplasm regions near
the nucleus where parallel G4s might exist as well. To preclude the
background interferences and the unspecific binding in cells, compounds
GD1 and GD2 with similar scaffold and photophysical properties of
GD3 were used to stain ARPE-19 cells as negative controls, and their
imaging results are recorded in Figure S12. Compared to the strong red emission in cells stained with GD3,
no signal could be detected in cells with GD1 and only weak red emission
could be detected from cells with GD2, which were highly consistent
with the results of G4 detection in vitro, demonstrating that GD3
would be a new kind of G4 fluorescent probes with low interferences
in cells. To confirm the sensing targets of GD3 in nucleus and in
cytoplasm regions, respectively, deoxyribonuclease (DNase) and ribonuclease
(RNase) digestion experiments were performed, and the results are
shown in Figure 4D,F.
Predigesting cells with DNase made the emission spots in nucleus dramatically
weakened or even disappeared, but reserved in cytoplasm. In contrast,
the RNase predigested only decreased emission signals in cytoplasm
regions, but kept the signal in nucleus. When predigesting cells with
both DNase and RNase, no emission signal was observed with GD3 staining
(Figure 4F) which results
that GD3 is capable of lighting up nucleic acid in cells. In combination
with the in vitro discrimination results, we presume that the signal
is mainly located at DNA G4s foci and RNA G4s foci in cells, demonstrating
that GD3 might be a competent G4s staining agent in cells with a clear
background.

Conclusions
In summary, three bis(4-aminobenzylidene)acetone
derivatives with
different numbers of methoxy substituents were synthesized, and their
spectral responses to several oligonucleotides with different secondary
structures were investigated and compared. Among them, compound GD3
with four methoxy groups exhibited a preferable binding property to
parallel G4 structures in vitro, accompanied with an evident red emission
enhancement. The lighting-up of parallel G4s is attributed to the
microenvironmental polarity changes and the conformational confinement
induced by the complexation of GD3 with parallel G4s. Therefore, GD3
was applied to stain G4 structures in cells and exhibited preferential
localization of DNA G4 and RNA G4 structures. In general, this study
provided a new building block, bis(4-aminobenzylidene)acetone derivative,
for developing fluorescence probes to detect and investigate G4s in
biological processes.

Experimental Section
General Information
All reagents were obtained from
Beijing Innochem Co. and used without further purification. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker AVANCE
400 spectrometer. Ultrapure water (18 MΩ/cm) was used for the
preparation of all aqueous solutions. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization–time
of flight–mass spectrum was measured by a Bruker BIFLEX III
spectrometer. UV–vis absorption spectra were recorded with
a Hitachi U-3010 spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence spectra were
carried out on a Hitachi F-7000 spectrophotometer. Fluorescence quantum
yields were determined by using Nile Red (0.38 in methanol) as standards.

Molecular Docking Method
Molecular docking was carried
out using the CDOCKER module in Discovery Studio (BIOVIA), and the
G4 structures (PDB codes: 2L7V(40) and 3EM2(41)) were retrieved from the RCSB PDB databank. All water molecules
were deleted. Explicit hydrogen atoms of the G4 were added. The active
site center was set as the mean coordinates of the atoms from the
original ligand. The radius of the binding site was set to 15 Å.
Then, GD1, GD2, and GD3 were prepared for Docking by using “prepare
ligands” module in Discovery Studio (BIOVIA). All other parameters
were set as default. The Docking results were displayed by Discovery
Studio Visualizer.

Cell Culture and Imaging
ARPE-19
cells were grown at
37 °C under 5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle
medium (Gibco; Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.
Before staining experiments, cultured cells grown on special confocal
microscope dishes were fixed by precooled methanol (−20 °C)
for 1 min and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) three times.
The cell membrane was permeabilized by immersing 0.5% Triton X-100
for 1 min and then washed with PBS three times. For the DNase and
RNase digestion experiments, the cells were incubated with DNase or
RNase (100 μg/mL) at 37 °C for 2 h first and then stained
with GD3 at 37 °C for 15 min. Cells were rinsed by PBS three
times before imaging. The fluorescence imaging pictures in the experiments
were obtained with an equal parameter.
