Starting
from tryptamine and methoxymaleic anhydride, concise and
efficient total synthesis of cordatanine has been accomplished via
regioselective reduction of methoxymaleimide, acid-catalyzed intramolecular
cyclization of the formed lactamol, in situ stepwise oxidations leading
to aromatization, and intramolecular cyclization with the exchange
of N-regioselectivity. An attempted synthesis of regioisomeric natural
product zanthochilone has been described in brief with reversal of
reduction selectivity.

Introduction
Canthines are an important
section of β-carboline alkaloids,
and nearly 200 canthinone alkaloids exhibiting a broad range of potential
bioactivities have been reported in the literature.1,2 Pentralis
(6H-indolo[3,2,1-de][1,5]naphthyridin-6-one)
from Figure 1 was first
isolated in 1952, and several strategically elegant syntheses of this
class of compounds are known in the contemporary literature.1−7 The anti-human immunodeficiency virus alkaloid, cordatanine (4-methoxycanthin-6-one),
was isolated from Drymaria cordata in
1986 and then from Drymaria diandra in 2004 (EC50 0.699 μg/mL).8−10 The antifungal
alkaloid, zanthochilone (5-methoxycanthin-6-one), has been isolated
from the plant species Zanthoxylum chiloperone var. angustifolium.11,12 The total
synthesis of cordatanine and zanthochilone is a challenging task and
is of current interest due to their structural features, potential
bioactivities, and the seasonal changes that affect their concentration
in natural sources.8−13 Recently, Wu et al. accomplished the synthesis of cordatanine in
four steps with an 8% overall yield and unambiguously confirmed its
revised structural assignment;9,10,14 the synthesis of zanthochilone, however, is awaited. In continuation
of our studies on the use of cyclic anhydrides to synthesize bioactive
natural products,15−19 we herein report a facile regioselective approach to cordatanine
and attempted synthesis of zanthochilone from the readily available
common precursors, tryptamine and methoxymaleic anhydride20 (Schemes 1–4).

Scheme 1 Concise Retrosynthetic
Analysis of Regioisomeric Cordatanine and
Zanthochilone Alkaloids
Results and Discussion
A concise retrosynthetic analysis
of regioisomeric natural products
cordatanine and zanthochilone has been depicted in scheme 1, aiming at the synthesis of
two regioisomeric pyrrolotetrahydrocarbazole intermediates, intramolecular
exchange of nitrogen regioselectivity, and aromatization of ring C.
The reaction of tryptamine (1) with the freshly prepared
methoxymaleic anhydride (2)20 in refluxing o-dichlorobenzene delivered the required
methoxymaleimide 3 in 84% yield via regioselective ring
opening of 2, followed by the intramolecular dehydrative
cyclization route (Scheme 2). Regioselective NaBH4 reduction of more reactive
mesomerically nonconjugated imide carbonyl in 3 exclusively
formed the lactamol, 4a, in 97% yield. In the above specified
reaction, mesomeric conjugation of a lone pair of oxygen from the
methoxyl group deactivates one of the carbonyl groups, and the sterically
hindered carbonyl undergoes selective reduction. Lactamol 4a was fairly stable to the silica gel column chromatographic purification
and did not display any noticeable signs of associated decomposition.
Acid-catalyzed intramolecular dehydrative cyclization of lactamol 4a furnished the pyrrolotetrahydrocarbazole, 5, in 87% yield. At this stage, it was planned to perform the methanolysis
of pyrrolotetrahydrocarbazole 5, followed by oxidative
aromatization. Accordingly performed reaction of pyrrolotetrahydrocarbazole 5 with p-toluenesulfonic acid (p-TSA)/MeOH at room temperature under atmospheric conditions directly
provided the completely aromatized ester, 9a, in acceptable
yields (∼50%) in 24 h. In the above-mentioned reaction, both
methanolysis of lactam to ester and double air-oxidative aromatization
of the ring C took place in one pot. As expected, repetition of the
same reaction under a balloon pressure oxygen atmosphere delivered
product 9a in 88% yield in just 4 h. Careful thin-layer
chromatography monitoring of the above reaction also revealed that
it would be feasible to isolate one of the reaction intermediates
in the transformation of 5–9a. Thus,
the reaction of 5 with p-TSA/MeOH at
room temperature under an oxygen atmosphere was arrested after 1 h,
and we could successfully isolate the formed intermediate product,
pyrrolotetrahydrocarbazole 6, bearing a labile angular
methoxyl group, in 47% yield. The anticancer drug, mitomycin C, contains
such a type of angular oxygen function, which is responsible for its
several-fold higher activity than the corresponding mitosanes.21 Intermediate product 6 on similar
treatment with p-TSA/MeOH at room temperature under
an oxygen atmosphere also delivered the expected product, 9a, in very good yield. Thus, we propose that mechanistically first
the methoxyl group gets introduced at the highly reactive benzylic
angular position of compound 5 via the radical mechanism
to form product 6, which on protonation followed by elimination
of methanol forms the reactive iminium ion intermediate, 7, which quickly undergoes methanolysis to deliver the corresponding
dihydroester, 8, and finally the formed ester, 8, oxidizes in situ to yield the stable aromatic penultimate
product, 9a. An alternatively performed reaction of pyrrolotetrahydrocarbazole 5 with HCl/tetrahydrofuran (THF) at room temperature under
an oxygen atmosphere plausibly followed a similar type of mechanistic
pathway and also furnished the expected acid, 9b, in
84% yield. Finally, both K2CO3/MeOH-catalyzed
intramolecular cyclization of ester 9a and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)
carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDCI)-induced intramolecular dehydrative
cyclization of acid 9b resulted in the desired natural
product, cordatanine (10), in 93 and 84% yields, respectively.
The obtained analytical and spectral data for cordatanine (10) were in complete agreement with the reported data.9,10,14

Scheme 2 Concise and Efficient
Regioselective Total Synthesis of Cordatanine
Involving Stepwise Oxidative Aromatization
In the next part of the study, the synthesis of the second
regioisomeric
target compound, zanthochilone, was logically planned via reversal
in regioselective reduction of methoxymaleimide 3, and
selected results on the reduction of imide 3 have been
summarized in Table 1. Diisobutylaluminum hydride (DIBAL-H) reduction of imide 3 at −78 °C provided a silica gel column chromatographically
separable mixture of lactamols 4a (undesired) and 4b (desired) in 72% yield but with only a 68:32 ratio (Scheme 3; Table 1, entry 5). We feel that in
the reduction of imide 3, a small amount of desired isomer 4b is formed at a lower temperature due to the steric hindrance
of the methoxyl group and could also be due to the partial decline
in the mesomeric deactivation. Regioselective ring opening of methoxymaleic
anhydride (2) with tryptamine (1) in diethyl
ether formed maleamic acid 11 in 96% yield, which upon
diazomethane esterification resulted in corresponding ester 12 in 83% yield (Scheme 4). The alternatively performed
controlled chemoselective DIBAL-H reduction of ester 12 at −78 °C exclusively furnished the desired lactamol, 4b, in 73% yield via the corresponding unisolable intermediate
aldehyde, 13. Acid-catalyzed intramolecular dehydrative
cyclization of lactamol 4b yielded the planned regioisomeric
pyrrolotetrahydrocarbazole, 14, in 86% yield. Accordingly
performed reaction of pyrrolotetrahydrocarbazole 14 with p-TSA/MeOH at room temperature under a balloon pressure
oxygen atmosphere delivered acid 16 in 79% yield but
without the aromatization of ring C. We presume that in pyrrolotetrahydrocarbazole 14, hydrolysis of γ-lactam to form acid 16 was preferred over the methanolysis for steric reasons. In acid 16, conjugation of the methoxyl group with a labile imine
moiety could be the cause for the deactivation of the system, which
plausibly prohibited in situ oxidative aromatization of ring C. Remarkably,
the propensity of oxidation of ring C is dependent on the reactivity
of the imine moiety and the position of the methoxyl group. All attempts
to transform acid 16 to zanthochilone (17) via diazomethane esterification, EDCI-mediated intramolecular dehydrative
cyclization, and 1,2-dichloro 4,5-dicyanoquinone/Pd(C)-oxidation of
ring C met with failure and ended up in excessive decompositions of
the reaction mixtures.

Conclusions
In summary, practical
total synthesis of cordatanine has been accomplished
by taking advantage of facile oxygen-promoted stepwise oxidative aromatization.
The synthesis of two regioisomeric methoxyl-substituted pyrrolotetrahydrocarbazoles
from methoxymaleimide and methyl ester of methoxymaleamic acid is
noteworthy. Unfortunately, we were unable to complete the first total
synthesis of isomeric zanthochilone alkaloid due to the decomposition
of the product of the penultimate step under the sets of our reaction
conditions.
