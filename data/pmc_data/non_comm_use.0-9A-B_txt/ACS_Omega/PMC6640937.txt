Molybdenum
oxide nanomaterials have recently attracted widespread
attention for their unique optical properties and catalytic performance.
However, until now, there is little literature on the application
of photoluminescent molybdenum oxide nanomaterials in biological and
pharmaceutical sensing. Herein, photoluminescent molybdenum oxide
quantum dots (MoOx QDs) were synthesized
via a facile method, and then, the synthesized MoOx QDs were further applied as a new type of photoluminescent
probe to design a new off–on sensor for captopril (Cap) determination
on the basis of the fact that the quenched photoluminescence of MoOx QDs by Cu2+ was restored with Cap
through specific interaction between the thiol group of Cap and Cu2+. Under optimal conditions, the restored photoluminescence
intensity showed a good linear relationship with the content of Cap,
ranging from 1.0 to 150.0 μM, with a limit of detection of 0.51
μM (3σ/k). Additionally, the content of Cap in pharmaceutical
samples was successfully detected with the newly developed off–on
sensor, and the recoveries were 99.4–101.7%, which suggest
that the present off–on sensor has a high accuracy.

Introduction
Transition metal oxides,
including molybdenum oxide,1,2 vanadium oxide,3 titanium dioxide,4 germanium dioxide,5 tungsten oxide,6 nickel oxide,7 and
zinc oxide,8 have
stimulated great interest due to their optical, electrical, and semiconducting
properties and catalytic performance. In particular, molybdenum oxide
has drawn tremendous attention for its excellent properties, and numerous
methods, including the hydrothermal/solvothermal method,9 physical vapor deposition method,10 chemical spray pyrolysis,11 mechanical grinding and sonication,12 thermal oxidation,2 thermal
evaporation and decomposition, and electrospinning technologies,13,14 have been developed for the synthesis of molybdenum oxide nanomaterials
with a variety of morphologies because the physical and chemical properties
of molybdenum oxide nanomaterials are closely related to their morphologies.
Until now, molybdenum oxide nanomaterials have been used in many applications,
including gas sensors,1,2 catalysis,15 solar cells,16 photochromism,17 lithium-ion batteries,18 thin-film capacitors,18 field-effect
transistors,19,20 antiseptics, and anticancer treatments.14,21 However, only a few reports have mentioned the application of molybdenum
oxide nanomaterials as a photoluminescent probe in biological and
pharmaceutical fields, that is, there is still plenty of room for
methodological innovation.

Herein, photoluminescent molybdenum
oxide quantum dots (MoOx QDs) were prepared
by a one-pot method at room
temperature (Figure 1a) and a new photoluminescent sensor for captopril (Cap) detection
was constructed using MoOx QDs as an effective
probe. As an angiotensin-converting enzyme (inhibitor), Cap, 1-[(2s)-3-mercapto-2-methylpropionyl]-l-proline, plays a crucial
biological role in the treatment of hypertension, coronary heart disease,
congestive heart failure, and some types of diseases associated with
diabetes.22−24 Thus far, several methods have been proposed for
Cap determination, including voltammetry,25 chemiluminescence,26 flow injection spectrophotometry,27 surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy,28 and mass spectrometry.29 However, certain drawbacks limited the application of the above
methods. For example, electrochemical methods are sensitive enough,
but the preparation of electrodes is relatively tremendous while chemiluminescence
methods are simple and rapid, but they possess the limitation of low
detection sensitivity. Raman spectroscopy and mass spectrometry are
sensitive enough; however, the need for expensive instruments or complicated
procedures limits their application in routine analysis. Therefore,
it is necessary to establish a facile and sensitive method for Cap
determination in biological fluids and pharmaceutical samples. The
sensing platform for Cap developed in this manuscript is shown in Figure 1b. The system is
a combination of MoOx QDs and Cu2+, in which Cu2+ can generate a nonluminous complex with
the MoOx QDs, resulting in the quenching
of the photoluminescence of the MoOx QDs
(switched off) through static quenching processes. However, the formed
MoOx QDs–Cu2+ complex
might be dissociated after the introduction of Cap because Cu2+ displays a higher affinity toward the −SH from Cap.
As a consequence, the fluorescence of the MoOx QDs is restored (switched on), providing a facile switch-on assay
for Cap detection. On the basis of the proposed switch-on assay, the
Cap content in the pharmaceutical samples was successfully determined
with high sensitivity and good repeatability.

Results and Discussion
Characterization
of the Obtained MoOx QDs
The
MoOx QDs were synthesized
at room temperature using commercial MoS2 powder and H2O2 as the precursor and oxidant (Figure 1a), respectively,30,31 and the as-prepared
MoOx QDs had an average diameter of around
2.0 nm (Figure 2a)
and a height of about 1.5 nm (Figure 2b). From the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
spectra (Figures 2c,d
and S1), it can be clearly seen that Mo4+ and S2– were both oxidized by H2O2 to higher valence states, Mo5+ (230.6 and
232.8 eV) and Mo6+ (232.1 and 235.3 eV) and SO42– (168.5 and 169.7 eV), respectively.32−34 The average oxidation state, calculated from the XPS peak area proportion
of Mo5+ and Mo6+ in the MoOx QDs of Mo, was 5.91, suggesting the presence of oxygen
vacancies in the obtained MoOx QDs, which
is in agreement with previous reports.30−32,34−36 On the basis of these results, it can be concluded
that bulk MoS2 powder was first spontaneously exfoliated
by H2O2 during the reaction process (Figure 1a), in which S atoms
gradually exited the lattice of MoS2 while O atoms from
H2O2 immediately refilled the lattice vacancies
because the bonding affinity of Mo—O is stronger than that
of Mo—S.36 Finally, photoluminescent
MoOx QDs with a maximum absorbance at
317 nm (Figure 3) were
synthesized, and the strong absorption between 200–400 nm was
the reason for the charge transfer of the Mo—O band in the
MoO66– octahedron.37 Moreover, the MoOx QDs also
showed excitation-dependent emission, and the FL emission peak of
MoOx QDs progressively shifted to a longer
wavelength when the excitation increased from 325 to 475 nm, which
might be due to particles of different sizes and the distribution
of emissive trap sites on the surface of the MoOx QDs. The strong excitation-dependent fluorescence characteristics
of the MoOx QDs were also consistent with
those previously reported in the literature.35,38

525, 534, and 539 nm, respectively. Inset: Photographs obtained under

Quenching the Fluorescence of MoOx QDs
by Cu2+
As a common quencher, Cu2+ can
quench the fluorescence of organic fluorescent dyes,39 fluorescent proteins,40 and
carbon dots41 through electronic
transfer or other processes. On the basis of this, the photoluminescence
of MoOx QDs incubated with Cu2+ was first measured to confirm whether or not the photoluminescence
of MoOx QDs could be quenched by Cu2+. As shown in Figure 4a, MoOx QDs have a strong photoluminescence
emission peak at 527 nm when excited at 405 nm, whereas the photoluminescence
was gradually quenched as the concentration of Cu2+ increased,
and the maximal quenching efficiency reached nearly 90% when Cu2+ was 75 μM. To elucidate the quenching mechanism, the
fluorescence lifetimes of MoOx QDs and
MoOx QDs–Cu2+ were measured
(Figure 4b and Table S1), and the results show that the average
fluorescence lifetimes of MoOx QDs and
MoOx QDs–Cu2+ are 4.83
and 5.97 ns, respectively, which indicate that the static quenching
mechanism accounts for the decrease in photoluminescence and a nonluminous
complex is formed between MoOx QDs and
Cu2+. The formation of MoOx QDs–Cu2+ complexes was also confirmed by ultrafiltration
experiments. For ultrafiltration experiments, MoOx QDs–Cu2+ solutions were filtered through a 1 kDa
MWCO ultrafiltration membrane, through which only free Cu2+ ions in the solution could pass, whereas those adhering to MoOx QDs could not. The residues were then subjected
to XPS measurements, and the Cu2p peak was clearly observed in the
survey spectrum (Figure S4), suggesting
the formation of MoOx QDs–Cu2+ complexes.

to bottom are 0, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, 20.0, 40.0, 60.0, 80.0 μM,
respectively. Inset is the plot of photoluminescence intensities vs
Cu2+ concentration. (b) Fluorescence lifetimes of MoOx QDs, MoOx QDs–Cu2+ complexes, and MoOx QDs–Cu2+–Cap. The data were obtained from three parallel samples.

Construction of an Off–On
Sensor for Cap Determination
In view of the effective reaction
between Cu2+ and the
active thiol groups (−SH) in cysteine,41 the MoOx QDs–Cu2+ system
was utilized to detect the thiol-containing Cap tablets. Figure 5 shows the photoluminescence
recoveries of the MoOx QDs–Cu2+ system with increasing contents of Cap, and it can be clearly
seen that the photoluminescence was gradually restored as more and
more Cap was added. The reason for the photoluminescence recovery
might be as follows: a Cu2+—S bond can be formed
between the thiol group of Cap and Cu2+, resulting in the
removal of Cu2+ from the surface of MoOx QDs via competitive adsorption interactions (Figure 1b),41 which enhanced the photoluminescence. The desorption of Cu from
MoOx QDs–Cu2+ complexes
was also confirmed by XPS, and the results showed that the Cu2p peak
of the residues disappeared after the MoOx QDs–Cu2+–Cap solutions were passed through
a 1 kDa MWCD ultrafiltration membrane (Figure S5).

from the bottom to top are 0.0, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0, 25.0, 40.0,
50.0, 75.0, 100.0, and 150.0 μM, respectively. Inset is the
plot of photoluminescence changes at 527.0 nm vs Cap concentration.

mM; excitation: 405 nm. The data were obtained from three parallel
samples. (b) Photoluminescence responses of the off–on sensor

mg mL–1; Cu2+: 75 μM; Tris–HCl
buffer (pH 7.5): 50 mM; excitation: 405 nm; emission: 527 nm.

The photoluminescence recovery
was affected by pH and time, and
the photoluminescence intensity reached its maximum value at pH 7.5
within 5 min (Figures S2 and S3). Under
optimal conditions, the photoluminescence follows a linear relationship
with the Cap content, ranging from 1.0 to 150.0 μM, with a limit
of detection of 0.51 μM (3σ/k), which is comparable to
that of other methods, as shown in Table S2.

Detection of Cap in Pharmaceutical Samples Based on the New
Off–On Sensor
To further evaluate the selectivity
of the new off–on sensor for Cap, the photoluminescence responses
to other common ions and excipients in antihypertensive pills were
investigated. As shown in Figure 5b, the photoluminescence of other detected substances
showed no significant increase even when their concentrations were
10-fold higher than those of Cap, illustrating the high selectivity
of the developed off–on sensor, which might be employable for
Cap determination in real samples. Therefore, the Cap contents in
real pharmaceutical samples were detected to further illustrate the
feasibility. To avoid any interference from the sample matrix, a standard addition
method was used, spiking each pharmaceutical sample with a known concentration
of Cap. The results clearly showed that the sample matrix has no obvious
interference, and the actual Cap concentration of the pharmaceutical
sample could be obtained from the linear trend produced by the standard
addition method (Figure S6). Meanwhile,
Cap contents in pharmaceutical samples were successfully detected
(Table 1), and the
standard deviations and recovery (99.4–101.7%) demonstrated
that the proposed method for Cap detection has a high accuracy and
good repeatability, which can fulfill the needs of real applications.

Conclusions
In summary, photoluminescent MoOx QDs
were synthesized at room temperature and a new “off–on”
photoluminescent sensor was designed for Cap detection in pharmaceutical
samples based on MoOx QDs–Cu2+. The quenching and recovery mechanisms were carefully explored.
On the one hand, the photoluminescence of MoOx QDs was quenched by Cu2+ by a static quenching process,
which was attributed to the formation of nonluminous MoOx QDs–Cu2+complexes. On the other
hand, Cu2+ might be dissociated from MoOx QDs due to the stronger binding affinity of Cu2+ to the thiol group of Cap, resulting in restoration of the photoluminescence
of the MoOx QDs. Moreover, the content of Cap in the pharmaceutical
samples was successfully detected with the newly developed off–on
sensor; the standard deviations and recoveries (99.4–101.7%)
demonstrated high accuracy and good repeatability of the off–on
sensor, which fulfill the requirements for real-time applications.

Experimental
Section
Reagents
MoS2 powder was commercially obtained
from Sigma-Aldrich. NaOH, 30% H2O2, HCl, CuCl2, NaCl, Fe2(SO4)3, NaNO3, CaCl2, Mg(NO3)2, KCl, and
Zn(SO4)2 were provided by Shanghai Maikun Chemical
Reagents Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). Tris (C4H11O3) was purchased from Solarbio Company. Cap was supplied
from Wanjia (China). Starch, lactose, glucose, sucrose, and dextrin
were purchased from Guangzhou Yuwei Chemical Reagents Co., Ltd (Guangzhou,
China). All chemicals and solvents were of analytical grade and were
used without further purification. Deionized water was used in all experiments.

Apparatus
A JEM-2010 TEM (JEOL Ltd, Japan) with a 200
kV accelerating voltage and an AFM in the ScanAsyst mode were used
to obtain the size and height of the MoOx QDs, whereas XPS (Thermo) was used to characterized the elemental
composition and bonding configuration. The fluorescence lifetime was
measured by an FL-TCSPC fluorescence spectrophotometer (Horiba Jobin
Yvon Inc., France). The absorption was measured using a Shimadzu UV-2450
spectrophotometer (Tokyo, Japan), whereas a Hitachi F-7000 fluorescence
spectrophotometer (Tokyo, Japan) or a USB-4000FL spectrophotometer
(Ocean Optical) was utilized to record the fluorescence spectra.

Preparation of MoOx QDs
MoOx QDs were prepared using a one-pot
method at room temperature according to our previous studies,30,31 in which MoS2 and 30% hydrogen peroxide were selected
as the precursor and oxidant, respectively. Briefly, 10.0 mg of the
MoS2 powder was incubated with 10 mL of the mixing solution
(H2O–30% H2O2 = 3:2) for 30
min at room temperature. Thereafter, the pH of the mixture was adjusted
to 7.0 using sodium hydroxide (NaOH), with slow stirring for 20 min.
Finally, MoOx QDs were obtained by centrifuging
the resulting mixture at 8000g for 10 min.

Fluorescence
Sensing of Cu2+ and Cap
For
the detection of Cu2+, 20 μL of MoOx QD solution (1
mg/mL), 20 μL of Tris–HCl buffer solution (50 mM, pH
7.5), Cu2+, and H2O were added to a final volume
of 200 μL. The final concentration of Cu2+ ranged
from 0 to 80 μM. The resulting solutions were excited with a
405 nm laser, and their fluorescence spectra were recorded with a
USB-4000FL spectrophotometer.

For the detection of Cap, 20 μL
of MoOx QDs (1 mg/mL); 20 μL of
Tris–HCl buffer solution (50 mM pH 7.5); 15 μL of Cu2+ (1 mM), with a final concentration of 75 μM; different
concentrations of Cap solution; and deionized water were added to
a final volume of 200 μL. The final concentration of Cap ranged
from 0 to 150 μM. After incubation for 5 min, the fluorescence
spectra were recorded using a USB-4000FL spectrophotometer equipped
with a 405 nm laser light source.

Pharmaceutical Sample Preparation
The three pharmaceutical
samples were obtained from Henan Yu pharmaceuticals, Ltd, Shanghai
pharmaceutical Co., Ltd, and Hangzhou Minsheng pharmaceutical Co.,
Ltd, respectively. Four tablets of each sample were ground to a homogenized
powder. A portion of the powder containing 12.5 mg of Cap was accurately
weighted and dissolved in 10 mL of H2O. After ultrasonication
for 20 min, the supernatant was obtained by centrifuging at 500g for 5 min. The obtained sample solutions were diluted
300 fold before use. The standard Cap solution was added into the
diluted sample solutions for recovery tests to evaluate the accuracy
of the present off–on sensor.
