The
graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheets
decorated three-dimensional hierarchical flower-like nickel oxide
(NiO) composites (NiO/g-C3N4, Ni/CN) were synthesized
via a facile hydrothermal method combined with a subsequent annealing
process. The structure and morphology of the as-prepared Ni/CN composites
were characterized by X-ray diffraction, field-emission scanning electron
microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy, and nitrogen absorption. The gas-sensing experiments
reveal that the composites with 10 wt % two-dimensional g-C3N4 (Ni/CN-10) not only exhibits the highest response of
20.03 that is almost 3 times higher than pristine NiO to 500 ppm triethylamine
(TEA) at the optimal operating temperature of 280 °C but also
shows a good selectivity toward TEA. The gas-sensitivity promotion
mechanism is attributed to the internal charge transfer within the
p–n heterojunction. Furthermore, the high specific surface
area of the Ni/CN composites promotes adequate contact and reaction
between the composites and triethylamine molecules. Therefore, the
Ni/CN sensor has a great potential application in detecting TEA.

1 Introduction
Triethylamine (TEA), as
a transparent, inflammable liquid with
strong ammonia smell, is widely used as an antiseptic, organic solvent,
catalyst, synthetic dyestuff, and so on.1−4 However, long-term exposure to TEA atmosphere
could cause great harm to human health like nausea, headache, gastroenteritis,
pulmonary edema, and even death.5 Furthermore,
TEA is also secreted in dead fish and other seafood and the concentration
would increase over time.6 Therefore, TEA
could be used to judge the freshness of seafood. When TEA vapor is
mixed with air, it forms an explosive mixture that will explode if
exposed to flame. Although some traditional methods like the colorimetric
method and gas/liquid/film chromatography are effective for TEA detection,
the complex detection process and expensive equipment constrain the
application. However, due to the low cost, easy operation, and high
response of gas sensors, it is more convenient to detect TEA in the
chemical and food industries.

It has been reported that there
are many metal-oxide-semiconductor
(MOS)-based gas sensors for detecting TEA gas, such as TiO2,7 α-Fe2O3,8 and V2O5.9 Most of these MOS materials are n-type materials,
and there are few studies on TEA gas sensitivity for p-type materials,
and less research on nickel oxide (NiO). However, recent experiments
have shown that p-type materials have advantages in gas selectivity
and lower operating temperatures. In this study, a typical p-type
material (NiO) was used as the substrate for the TEA gas-sensing material,
and the gas-sensing properties and mechanisms were discussed. NiO
as an important p-type semiconductor material oxide with wide band
gap energy (Eg = 3.6–4.0 eV)10 has received considerable attention in various
fields such as catalysts,11 lithium-ion
batteries,12 magnetic materials,13 gas sensors,14 etc.
Many previous works have proven that NiO-based gas sensors show good
gas-sensitivity response to various types of toxic gases.15,16 Lin et al. reported that uniform hexagonal NiO nanosheets were prepared
by a hydrothermal method, and it shows excellent response to 50 ppm
of several reducing gases (ethanol, CO, H2S, CH4, and NH3).15 Lu et al. synthesized
cactus-like NiO via a simple hydrothermal approach and it has a response
value of 13.51 for 100 ppm acetone at a working temperature of 260
°C.16 Dey et al. reported that coral-like
NiO nanostructures were prepared by a facile hydrothermal technique,
the response of the NiO sensor was found to be 292% in the presence
of 190 ppm formaldehyde at 300 °C.17 In addition, the three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical structure has
a higher specific surface area and faster gas diffusion rate than
the conventional one-dimensional or two-dimensional (2D) structure.18−23 Ma et al. synthesized a photocatalyst of hierarchically mesoporous
titanium phosphonate by a hydrothermal method and it exhibited a significantly
improved photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate.18 Cao et al. reported that the gas-sensing properties of
the flower-like NiO structures are superior to the needle-like NiO
structures on the basis of the research.24 Lin et al. synthesized the camellia-like NiO materials by a hydrothermal
method, and they have a particular response to ethanol.25 Therefore, using 3D hierarchical flower-like
NiO as the basis of the sensing materials will have better gas-sensing
properties and excellent selectivity.

The sensors of pristine
NiO normally have a low gas-sensitivity
response. To improve the sensing properties, many scholars have compounded
MOS with ultra-thin two-dimensional nanomaterials and found that two-dimensional
nanomaterials can modify and sensitize MOS materials like noble metals.26,27 The graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is a
two-dimensional semiconductor with a band gap energy of 2.7 eV, which
has a large specific surface area and high chemical stability. Moreover,
it is also an environmentally friendly material. In previous studies,
there have been many reports on using it to modify various metal oxides
and found that it not only prevents the aggregation of metal oxide
nanoparticles but also forms a heterostructure with metal oxides to
bring about new chemical and physical characteristics.28−30 Cao et al. reported that SnO2/g-C3N4 nanocomposites were synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method,
and they exhibited the highest response value (S =
360) toward 500 ppm ethanol at 300 °C.31 Gong et al. synthesized Co3O4/g-C3N4 composites via a hydrothermal method, and they exhibited
excellent sensing properties toward ethanol, which is 1.6 times higher
than that of pure Co3O4.28 Zhang et al. reported that MgFe2O4/g-C3N4 composites were obtained by a solvothermal
technique. This material not only has a gas-sensitive response to
acetone of 145 times that of pure MgFe2O4 but
also reduces the optimum temperature by 60 °C.32 However, the application of the NiO/g-C3N4 heterojunction in the field of gas sensors has never been
reported. Therefore, in this work, we synthesized a spherical flower-like
Ni/CN composites by a simple hydrothermal method for TEA-sensing application.
In the TEA atmosphere, the sensitivity of the composite is much better
than pure NiO. In addition, the surface morphology, structural properties,
and gas-sensing mechanism of the composites were also studied and
discussed in detail.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Morphology and Structure of Pure NiO and Ni/CN
Composites
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-prepared
g-C3N4, NiO, and Ni/CN composites are shown
in Figure 1. The peak
at 27.5° in g-C3N4 is the characteristic
(002) plane peak arising from the stacking of conjugated aromatic
planes in g-C3N4. The peak at 13.1° could
be assigned to the (100) plane, representing the interlayer structure
packing motif of tri-s-triazine units. The pure NiO
presents five peaks at 2θ values of 37.2, 43.3, 62.4, 75.4,
and 79.1° corresponding to the (111), (200), (220), (311), and
(222) planes, respectively, which are in accordance with the powder
diffraction standard spectrum (JCPDS card no. 47-1049). The plane
peak (002) of g-C3N4 is clearly present in the
Ni/CN composite, indicating that g-C3N4 and
NiO are successfully compounded. As the content of g-C3N4 in the composite increases, the (002) characteristic
peak intensity becomes stronger. Comparing the XRD patterns of the
composites, it can be concluded that the (002) characteristic peak
is the strongest and sharpest in the Ni/CN-15 composites, while the
strength is very weak in the Ni/CN-5 composites. Only in the Ni/CN-10
composites, the (002) characteristic peak intensity is relatively
moderate, which may be related to the formation of the heterojunction.

and Ni/CN composites with different g-C3N4 contents.

Surface chemical compositions
of the pure g-C3N4, pristine NiO, and Ni/CN-10
heterostructure were further
studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As shown in the
survey scan XPS spectrum (Figure 2a), C 1s and N 1s are detected in g-C3N4 and Ni/CN-10, while Ni 2p and O 1s peaks are observed in
the spectra of NiO and Ni/CN-10. The C 1s peak from pure NiO is due
to the adventitious carbon.33 The presence
of a peak of N 1s in the spectrum of the Ni/CN-10 composite means
that g-C3N4 is successfully incorporated into
NiO. The corresponding high-resolution (HR) spectra of C 1s, N 1s,
O 1s, and Ni 2p are also shown in Figure 2, respectively. The high-resolution O 1s
spectra of NiO is presented in Figure 2b, in which the dominated peak at 529.4 eV originated
from the Ni–O bond, 531.3 eV corresponds to chemically adsorbed
oxygen species or OH species, and the peak at 532.7 eV may be related
to the adsorbed water molecules.34−36 After calculation, the
chemically adsorbed oxygen content of Ni/CN-10 is 16.2%, which is
much higher than the value of NiO (10.5%). Ni/CN-10 contains a higher
chemical adsorption oxygen content, which means that more oxygen anions
are formed on the surface of the material, which is beneficial to
improve gas sensitivity.

pristine NiO, and Ni/CN-10:
(a) the general scan spectrum, (b) O 1s spectrum, (c) Ni 2p spectrum,
(d) C 1s of Ni/CN-10, and (e) N 1s spectrum of Ni/CN-10.

The high-resolution Ni 2p XPS spectrum of NiO (Figure 2c) has five prominent
peaks,
which are typical characteristic peaks of Ni in Ni–O bonds.37 The peak with a binding energy of 854.2 eV corresponds
to Ni 2p3/2 and the other peak corresponds to Ni 2p1/2, which is 872.7 eV.36,38 Other peaks were induced
by shaking at 861.2 and 879.7 eV.37 In
addition, the split peak of Ni 2p3/2 at 855.9 eV and the
peak of O 1s at 531.3 eV indicate the coexistence of Ni2O3.39 However, a slight shift
in the binding energy of O 1s and Ni 2p is observed in the spectrum
of the Ni/CN-10 composite. The O 1s peak positions are changed to
529.3, 531.1, and 532.4, respectively. The Ni 2p peak positions are
changed to 854.1, 855.6, 861.0, 827.8, and 879.5, respectively. This
phenomenon can be attributed to the interaction of electron transfer
and interface in the p–n heterojunction formed by the two phases.39 Three sub-bands located at 284.6, 286.3, and
287.9 eV (Figure 2d)
can be observed in C 1s spectra of Ni/CN-10, which corresponds to
sp2 C–C bonds, the combination of C–N groups
and N–C=N groups, respectively. Figure 2e shows the N 1s spectra for Ni/CN-10. The
prominent peak at 398.64 eV belongs to the sp2-hybridized
aromatic N bond to carbon (C=N–C), while the peaks at
399.8 and 404.2 eV are ascribed to the tertiary nitrogen (N–(C)3 or H–N–(C)2) groups and π
excitations.40

The morphology of
pure g-C3N4, pristine NiO,
and Ni/CN-10 heterojunction samples are characterized using scanning
electron microscopes (SEMs). It can be observed that the as-prepared
g-C3N4 exhibits a two-dimensional (2D) layered
structure with many wrinkles (Figure 3a). Moreover, the pristine NiO presents a perfect 3D
hierarchical flower-like morphology (Figure 3b) and it can be seen in Figure 3c that the flower particles
are uniformly distributed. In Figure 3d, we can clearly see that the Ni/CN-10 composites
prepared in this experiment combine the structural characteristics
of both. In addition, we not only observed the samples showing the
3D layered nanostructure of NiO and the thin nanosheets of g-C3N4 but also observed that the sheet involved in
the composition of NiO was filled into the nanosheet of g-C3N4. This proves that the two materials can be successfully
compounded by the hydrothermal method.

Figure 3 SEM images of (a) 2D
g-C3N4, (b, c) NiO,
and (d) Ni/CN-10 composites.

It can be observed from the transmission electron microscopy
(TEM)
image of g-C3N4 (Figure 4a) that pure g-C3N4 is curly and transparent, indicating that it is indeed a very thin
nanosheet structure. Figure 4b shows a TEM image of NiO, which can be seen as a flower-like
sphere assembled from NiO sheets, and the NiO sheet is also relatively
thin. The TEM image of the Ni/CN-10 composite is shown in Figure 4c, and it can be
seen that g-C3N4 covers the surface of NiO,
and it can be seen that the g-C3N4 flake is
bonded among the NiO particles. This is consistent with the SEM image.
The selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of Ni/CN-10
indicates that the crystalline nature of NiO is a single particle.
The appearance of a bright arc in the diffraction circle in the SAED
pattern indicates that the flower sphere is formed by NiO nanocrystals
in a highly preferred orientation. The HRTEM image of the Ni/CN-10
composite (Figure 4d) illustrates the inclusion of NiO nanoparticles in g-C3N4. Moreover, the HRTEM image shows that the stripe pitch
of 0.21 nm can be directed to the (200) crystal plane of NiO. There
were some transparent structures without clear lattice existing around
the black NiO crystals, which were considered to be g-C3N4 of low crystallinity. What deserves more attention
is the close contact between the two phases, indicating the formation
of heterojunctions and affecting the charge transfer at the contact
interface. In summary, according to the results of XRD, XPS, SEM,
and TEM analyses, this experiment successfully combined 3D flower-like
NiO with the g-C3N4 nanosheet by a hydrothermal
method.

(c) Ni/CN-10 composites, and (d) HRTEM image and SAED pattern of Ni/CN-10.

To evaluate the specific surface
area and the porosity of the Ni/CN-10
composites, N2-absorption measurements were performed.
The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm and the corresponding
pore size distribution analysis of the Ni/CN-10 composites are shown
in Figure 5. According
to the IUPAC, the isotherms of the sample belong to the classical
type IV pattern (Figure 5a), which reflects the typical characteristics of the mesoporous
structure. The hysteresis loop of Ni/CN-10 belongs to the H3-type,
demonstrating the existence of slit-like pores formed by NiO and g-C3N4 nanoflakes. Figure 5b illustrates the pore size distribution
curves of the Ni/CN-10 composites. It can be seen that the pore sizes
of the composites are mostly concentrated in the range of about 3–10
nm. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area of Ni/CN-10
samples was calculated to be 264.103 m2/g. Moreover, such
a large surface area can provide more adsorption sites for the gas
molecules, and the larger mesoporous pore size can enhance the diffusion
velocity of the gas molecules, thus improving the gas sensitivity.

Ni/CN-10 and (b) pore size distribution of Ni/CN-10.

2.2 Gas-Sensing Properties
To study the
performance of the prepared TEA vapor-based sensor, a series of gas-sensing
tests were conducted. During the test, the operating temperature range
of the laboratory was 180–320 °C. To obtain a conclusion
that the composite material has better gas sensitivity to TEA, a pure
NiO-based sensor was also tested. For gas-sensing tests, the operating
temperature is the first consideration because temperature affects
the chemical reactions occurring on the surface of the MOS materials
and the adsorption and desorption of gases. Therefore, the response
of the Ni/CN composite and the pure 3D layered flower-like NiO-based
sensor to 500 ppm TEA vapor at different temperatures was tested.
It can be seen from Figure 6a that as the temperature rises from 180 to 320 °C, all
of the sensors show a trend of increasing first and then decreasing.
The response of the sensors based on pure NiO, Ni/CN-5, Ni/CN-10,
and Ni/CN-15 reached the highest value at 280 °C, so the optimal
operating temperature of the sensor is 280 °C. The response values
of pure NiO, Ni/CN-5, Ni/CN-10, and Ni/CN-15 to 500 ppm TEA at 280
°C were 6.64, 7.31, 20.04, and 16.957, respectively. Compared
with the pure NiO sensor, all Ni/CN-based sensors have higher response
over the entire test temperature range, indicating that the introduction
of g-C3N4 in NiO can greatly enhance the response
of sensors to TEA. As the content of 5–10 wt % g-C3N4 was added, the response value of the composite increased,
however, the response value decreased as the content of g-C3N4 was further increased. This result indicates that the
mass percentage of the best g-C3N4 in the composite
system is 10%.

Figure 6 (a) Responses of the sensors toward 500 ppm TEA at different
operating
acting temperatures. (b) Response curves of pure NiO and Ni/CN-10
sensors at 280 °C for different TEA concentrations.

Figure 6b shows
the response of NiO and Ni/CN-10 to different TEA concentrations at
280 °C in the range of 30–1000 ppm. As the concentration
of TEA increased, the response of two sensors increased gradually,
but the response increased more slowly as the concentration increased.
It can be seen that when the TEA concentration reaches 1000 ppm, the
adsorption of the sensor on the TEA is nearly saturated. In addition,
the response amplitude of Ni/CN is always higher than that of pure
NiO, indicating that it is more sensitive to TEA.

Figure 7a shows
the real-time response curves of the pure NiO and Ni/CN-10 sensors
to different concentrations of TEA at 280 °C. It can be observed
that the response values of the two samples increased as the concentration
of TEA increased in the range of 30–1000 ppm. Moreover, the
response amplitude of the Ni/CN-10 sensor is much higher than that
of the pure NiO sensor, and the difference between the response values
of the two sensors also increased with the increase of the TEA concentration,
indicating that the gas-sensing performance of the composite material
is improved.

sensors
to TEA in the range of 30–1000 ppm at 280 °C. (b, c) Repeatability
and stability measurements of Ni/CN-10 sensors to 500 ppm TEA at 280
°C. (d) Response values of the sensors to 500 ppm different gases
at 280 °C.

The repeatability and
stability of the Ni/CN-10 sensor were also
tested, which are key factors influencing the life of gas performances.
As shown in Figure 7b, the response of the Ni/CN-10 sensor to 500 ppm TEA at 280 °C
remained almost constant and remained at around 20. It can be seen
that the response–recovery time of Ni/CN-10 is also stable,
according to the calculation, the response time is about 157 s and
the recovery time is about 350 s. Moreover, the sensor response fluctuates
in a small range in a period of 30 days (Figure 7c). Therefore, the as-prepared Ni/CN-10 sensor
has excellent TEA gas-sensing repeatability and stability and is very
suitable for the application of the TEA sensor in practical life. Figure 7d shows the response
of pure NiO and Ni/CN-10 to other 500 ppm volatile organic compounds
at 280 °C, including ethanol, acetone, formaldehyde, methanol,
and methylbenzene. It can be seen that the Ni/CN-10 sensor has a higher
response to several other gases than the pure NiO sensor, and the
response of Ni/CN-10 to TEA is higher than other gases, indicating
that the sensor has a good selectivity to TEA. According to the literature,41 the bond energies of C–N, C–O,
C–H, O–H, C=C, and C=O, are 307, 326,
414, 458.8, 610.3, and 798.9 kJ/mol, respectively. The higher response
to TEA may be due to the low bond energy of C–N, which makes
the TEA molecules more susceptible to be reduced by Ni/CN materials. Table 1 lists the gas-sensing
properties of Ni/CN-10-based sensors and other reported material-based
sensors toward TEA. As can be seen from Table 1, Ni/CN-10 possesses lower operating temperature
and higher response value than other nanostructure pure NiO-based
sensors. This analysis results indicated that the as-prepared Ni/CN-10
composite has good gas sensitivity to TEA.

2.3 Gas-Sensing Mechanism
As a p-type
semiconductor, the gas-sensing mechanism of NiO could be explained
by the change of sensor resistance when the sensor is exposed to air
and test gases. The degree of change in the resistance of the sensor
is mainly controlled by the width of the hole accumulation layers
(HALs) formed on the surface of the NiO. When the NiO sensor is exposed
to the air environment, oxygen molecules will be adsorbed on the surface
of NiO, transfer holes to the valence band of NiO, and then exist
as substances of O–, O2–, and O2– by ionization. Moreover, the existence
of oxygen anions is closely related to temperature,47 as shown in Figure 9a. In this case, the concentration of holes on the surface
of NiO increases, and then a HAL is formed, resulting in a decrease
in the resistance of the sensor in air.48 As shown in Figure 9b, when the sensor is exposed to a reducing gas (such as TEA vapor),
the triethylamine molecule is also adsorbed onto the surface of NiO,
and the oxygen anions readily react with triethylamine molecules due
to their relatively low binding energy and oxidizing ability 1   2  The electrons released by
the oxygen ions
recombine with the holes. As a result, the concentration of holes
on the surface of NiO is lowered, resulting in an increase in sensor
resistance.49,50 In summary, the change in resistance
of NiO sensors in different gas environments is achieved based on
the adsorption and desorption of oxygen molecules. The excellent gas-sensing
properties for 3D layered flower-like NiO can be attributed to its
unique porous structure, and it is composed of a large number of nanosheet
arrays, which are beneficial to the rapid diffusion and transportation
of triethylamine molecules. For Ni/CN composites, g-C3N4 nanosheets play an important role in improving gas-sensing
performance. It is generally believed that the p–n heterojunction
formed on the nanosheets may be a major factor in improving the gas
sensitivity of the Ni/CN composites. The p–n junction (NiO
and g-C3N4) formed on the Ni/CN sheet can be
seen by the HRTEM image. Since the work function of NiO (5.0 eV)51 is larger than g-C3N4 (4.3
eV),52 electrons migrate from g-C3N4 to the conduction band of NiO through the bending band,
and the holes migrate in the opposite direction until their Fermi
level becomes equal. A part of the holes of HAL on NiO is neutralized
by electrons from g-C3N4, and as a result, a
hole depletion layer is formed on the NiO side. Therefore, the thickness
of HAL on the Ni/CN particles is reduced, so that the Ra of Ni/CN is higher than that of pure NiO, as illustrated
in Figure 9c. It can
be seen from Figure 8 that the Ra value of Ni/CN-10 is about
2.0 kΩ, which is higher than that of NiO (0.9 kΩ), and
the results conform to the above inference. For p-type materials whose
response is defined as Rg/Ra, a higher Ra value will
result in a lower response value. However, the gas-sensitivity test
results show that the response of the Ni/CN sensor is much higher
than that of the pure NiO sensor. This is due to the lattice mismatch
effect between NiO and g-C3N4. That is to say,
defects formed near the region of the p–n junction may become
potentially active sites for gas adsorption and surface reactions,53 which will allow the Ni/CN composite to provide
more active sites for the surface reaction between TEA molecules and
oxygen anions. After the reaction, more electrons are released back
to NiO, more holes in the HAL are neutralized by electrons, and the
thickness of the HAL is further reduced, resulting in a higher Rg of the Ni/CN sensor than pure NiO. At the
same time, the effect of electron migration from g-C3N4 to NiO conduction band also exists, further increasing the
resistance of Ni/CN, as shown in Figure 9d.

Figure 8 Response transient of
the sensors to 500 ppm TEA at 280 °C.

Figure 9 Interaction of the flower-like NiO surface with oxygen at different
temperatures (a), a schematic model for the flower-like NiO sensor
during exposure to TEA (b), and the energy band diagram of Ni/CN when
exposed to air (c) and TEA gas (d).

In addition, it was found that as the g-C3N4 content was increased from 5 to 10 wt %, the response of
the Ni/CN-10
sensor was increased, and as the g-C3N4 content
was further increased to 15 wt %, the response was observed to decrease.
This phenomenon is also explained by the p–n junction. When
the g-C3N4 content is relatively low (<10
wt %), all g-C3N4 nanosheets form (p) NiO–(n)
g-C3N4 junctions with the flower-like NiO nanomaterials,
which means that with the increasing contents of g-C3N4, the composite will provide more active sites for surface
reactions and thus increase the response. When the content of g-C3N4 is higher than 10 wt %, excessive g-C3N4 nanosheets will accumulate on the surface of NiO, which
hinders the contact of TEA molecules with the Ni/CN surface to inhibit
the TEA-sensing reaction. This is consistent with the analysis of
the results of XRD and SEM.

3 Conclusions
In summary, the flower-like NiO and g-C3N4 decorative flower-like NiO composites (Ni/CN) were successfully
synthesized by a simple one-step hydrothermal method. The sensors
based on NiO and Ni/CN materials were systematically studied by XRD,
SEM, TEM, XPS, and N2-adsorption. Compared to the pure
NiO sensor, the Ni/CN-10 sensor exhibits an enhanced response to triethylamine
at an optimum temperature of 280 °C and a nearly 3-fold increase
in response. In addition to the higher response, the Ni/CN sensor
has better selectivity and stability, mainly due to the introduction
of g-C3N4. The excellent gas-sensing properties
of Ni/CN-10 composites indicate that this material is an ideal candidate
for triethylamine gas-sensing applications.

Section
4.1 Sample Preparation
The chemicals
of nickel chloride (NiCl2·6H2O, 98.0%,
AR), urea (CO(NH2)2 99.0%, AR), and sodium dodecyl
sulfonate (SDS, C12H25NaO3S, 97.0%,
CP) were purchased from Tianjin Kermel Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.
(Tianjin, China) and used as received without further purification.
Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) was synthesized
by our previously reported method.54 In
a typical experiment, 10 wt % g-C3N4 nanosheets
decorated 3D hierarchical flower-like NiO (Ni/CN-10) were synthesized
by the hydrothermal method. 0.0166 g g-C3N4 was
dispersed in a 20 mL mixed solution, which contained 10 mL of deionized
water and 10 mL of ethanol, with ultrasonic treatment for 2 h. Meanwhile,
0.289 g (1 mmol) of sodium dodecyl sulfonate (SDS) was dissolved in
20 mL of distilled water under magnetic stirring for 10 min to form
a clear solution. Then 0.475 g (2 mmol) NiCl2·6H2O, and 0.600 g (10 mmol) of urea were dissolved into the g-C3N4 mixture solution under magnetic stirring for
20 min. Subsequently, 20 mL of SDS solution was added into the above
solution dropwise and stirred continuously for 30 min at room temperature.
The homogeneous mixture was transferred into a 50 mL stainless-steel
Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 120 °C for 12 h. The product
was washed with deionized and ethanol several times and dried at 60
°C for 10 h. Finally, the composites were obtained by calcining
the precipitate at 350 °C for 2 h under air atmosphere. According
to this method, the 5 and 15 wt % g-C3N4 decorated
NiO were also prepared and marked as Ni/CN-5 and Ni/CN-15. For the
comparison purpose, the same method was used to synthesize the pure
3D hierarchical flower-like NiO.

4.2 Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction
(XRD) analysis was performed on a Bruker AXS D8 (Bruker, Madison,
WI) Advance diffractometer to examine the purity and crystalline of
the samples, with Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 25 mA over a
range of 10–80° (2θ). The product morphologies and
microstructures were observed by field-emission scanning electron
microscopy (Quanta 250 FEG) (FEI, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) and
high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM JEOL, JEM-2100)
(JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements
were tested on a Thermo ESCALAB 250XI X-ray photoelectron spectrometer
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with the Al Kα radiation,
and energy calibration by fixing the binding energy of C 1s to 284.6
eV. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were obtained
on a Quantachrome Autosorb-iQ2 sorption analyzer (Quantachrome, Boynton
Beach, FL).

4.3 Gas-Sensing Properties
Test
The gas-sensitivity
properties of pure NiO and Ni/CN composites were investigated using
a static gas-sensing analysis system of CGS-4TPS (Beijing Elite Tech
Co., Ltd. Beijing, China). Figure 10 shows the schematic of the gas-sensing test system
and the construction of the fabricated sensor. The sample was dispersed
in distilled water and made the mixture to form a paste, which was
then slowly dropped onto the surface of a ceramic substrate (13.4
mm × 7 mm) with interdigitated Ag–Pd electrode and dried
at 60 °C overnight to obtain the resistance type sensor. Before
carrying out the measurement, the sensors were heated and degassed
for more than 2 h at 300 °C in air to improve the stability and
repeatability. The test gas is injected into the closed chamber of
the system described above using a microsyringe. The resistance of
the sensor in the test gas and air is Rg and Ra, respectively, and the ratio
of the resistance between the two is defined as the response (S = Rg/Ra) of it. The response and recovery time were defined as the
time taken for the sensor to reach 90% of the equilibrium value in
the case of injecting and removing the test gas, respectively. During
the test, the relative humidity was 18% in the test chamber. During
the test, from the injection of the test gas to the end of the gas
release, the response time of each sensor was controlled at 200 s.
