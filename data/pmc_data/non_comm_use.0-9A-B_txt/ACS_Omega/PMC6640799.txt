This
article reports the preparation of silver-free Au nanocages
from cubic palladium templates. Pd nanocubes were subjected to galvanic
replacement with Au3+ to produce Pd@Au nanocages having
tunable dimensions (i.e., edge length, gold layer thickness, and hollow
pore size), which allowed selectable positioning of the optical extinction
maxima from the visible to the near infrared. These new nanocages
circumvent the problems associated with previous Ag-derived gold alloy
nanocages, which suffer from the toxicity of residual silver and the
possible fragmentation of such alloyed nanostructures, thereby limiting
their potential applications. In contrast, the present materials represent
stable, nontoxic, tunable, and hollow plasmonic nanostructures.

Introduction
Among the various nanoparticle
architectures being pursued for
optical, catalytic, energy collection/conversion, and theranostic
applications,1−4 hollow nanocages and nanoframes have drawn intense interest due
to the potential utilization of their inner void space.5−8 This feature enables the rapid diffusion of chemicals to and from
confined reactive sites, leading to an increase in catalytic activity9,10 and the potential for payload storage and delivery.6,7,11 These nanostructures also exhibit
an enhanced interaction with light and the surrounding media due to
their greater exposed surface area as compared to that of solid nanoparticles.
Furthermore, a high surface-to-volume ratio represents a more efficient
applications design given the high cost of noble metals such as Pt,
Pd, and Au. Notably, an additional requirement for nanomedicinal applications
is that these nanoparticles should ideally adsorb/scatter light in
the near-infrared (NIR)—a region of the light spectrum where
human tissue exhibits little or no adsorption.12

Typically, hollow nanostructures, such as nanocages,
are synthesized
using a core metal particle as a sacrificial template, followed by
a galvanic reaction with the salt of a second metal that both engages
in a redox reaction with the first metal, slowly oxidizing the metal
of the core particle, and deposits on the template surface upon reduction.13 Silver, which enjoys a low reduction potential
(AgCl/Ag0, 0.22 V vs SHE),14 has been the most common sacrificial metal reported for galvanic
replacement to produce various types of hollow nanostructures.1,8,13,15 Starting with an Ag template, NIR-active Au nanocages, nanoframes,
and hollow nanoshells can be formed concomitantly with a slight increase
in diameter over the template. Xia and co-workers have conducted extensive
research in the development of such silver-templated hollow nanostructures
for use in biomedical applications.7,11 Separate studies
have argued that hollow nanostructures, which contain residual silver
from the initial template, can undergo fragmentation upon irradiation
in vivo.16 Additionally, the known toxicity
of silver limits the clinical usage of silver-templated nanostructures.17−19 In contrast, Pd-based nanostructures have shown good biocompatibility.20−24

A variety of other noble metal combinations in the form of
“nanocages”
have also been reported, in which the resulting nanostructure is a
hollow double-shelled nanocube (NC), an architecture that has reduced
interior access as compared to that in a nanoframe.25 For drug-release applications, easy access to the hollow
core is necessary for efficient drug loading, but this requirement
must be balanced by the need to control delivery of the drug. Recently,
Park and co-workers proposed a new approach to growing a gold shell
on a platinum framework, producing a variety of nanorings.26 These researchers also synthesized Au nanoframes
over multiple steps that exhibited NIR extinctions.27 Such efforts provide insight into how judicious choices
in the approach to synthesizing nanostructures can significantly impact
the size, shape, and composition of the product. These reports also
reveal the varying terminology used to describe the nanostructures
involved. In this article, we have chosen to use the term “nanocage”
rather than “nanoframe” for our targeted hollow nanostructures
because they have limited access to the interior void space afforded
by their facial openings.

To address the shortcomings noted
above, we sought to prepare NIR-active
silver-free gold nanocages by starting with palladium NCs as nontoxic,
inert templates.20−24 Palladium also exhibits a significantly higher bulk melting point
than that of Ag, which leads to its enhanced photothermal stability.23 Given these collective considerations, various
types of Pd nanoparticles have shown promise in photothermal therapies.21,22 Several strategies have been developed for the synthesis of Pd NCs
in a broad range of sizes to enable the tuning of the localized surface
plasmon resonance (LSPR) of the resulting palladium nanoparticles.28−30 Such NC structures typically produce an extinction maximum at a
longer wavelength due to their sharp corners and edges. But the higher
scattering cross-section (Qsca) compared
to that for absorption (Qabs) for the
larger sizes of Pd nanoparticles29 and
strong intrinsic plasmon damping31 limits
the efficiency of Pd NCs for use as light-triggered nanomaterials.
On the other hand, gold exhibits a strong absorption cross-section
and is known for its biocompatibility and stability in biological
media. Recently, studies have explored the use of Pd NCs as templates
for the synthesis of hollow nanostructures using Pt and Rh salts for
the galvanic reaction.32−34 However, neither of these combinations of metals
would afford particles having optical extinctions in the NIR. Therefore,
we sought to take advantage of the outstanding properties of Au coupled
with the thermal stability and nontoxicity of Pd templates to design
nanocages (Pd@Au nanocages) for their ultimate use in the photothermally
initiated release of small molecules for biomedical applications.

At first glance, the galvanic reaction we propose appears to be
favored because the standard reduction potential of Pd2+/Pd0 (0.951 V vs SHE) is slightly lower than the one for
AuCl4–/Au0 (1.002 V vs SHE),
but the reduction of Au3+ to Au0 is a two-step
process: AuCl4–/AuCl2– (0.926 V vs SHE) and AuCl2–/Au0 (1.154 V vs SHE).35 As
a consequence, we concluded that a direct galvanic replacement between
Pd NCs and the AuCl4– salt would be unfavored
(even though the authors of a 2007 study on Au–Pd bimetallic
systems concluded that a redox transmetallation reaction does occur
between Au3+ and Pd0,36 but the inclusion of hydrazine in their reaction conditions brings
their assertions into question). Our concerns regarding the reduction
potentials disfavoring a reaction were validated by the results obtained
from energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy for the reaction of
Pd NCs with a large amount of Au(III) salt solution: EDX showed no
significant levels of Au in the nanoparticles after reaction for 2
h at 80 °C (see Table S1). On the
other hand, although Au(I) is thermodynamically capable of undergoing
galvanic replacement, disproportionation of Au(I) to Au(0) and Au(III)
limits the use of AuCl2– as a gold precursor
for galvanic replacement.14 One frequently
used method to enable this redox chemistry is to add excess halide
ions (i.e., chloride and bromide), but the use of these halides requires
high temperatures and long reaction times (5–6 h),36,37 which is ineffective for controlling the morphology during the synthesis
of hollow nanostructures.

To overcome these problems, we sought
a strategy to lower the reduction
potential of Pd0 and increase the reduction potential of
Au(III) to facilitate the plating process. We achieved the former
by adding potassium iodide (KI), leading to the formation of PdI42–, which enjoys a significantly diminished
reduction potential (PdI42–/Pd0, 0.228 V vs SHE).38 With regard to Au(III),
we employed “K-gold” solution as a gold precursor, which
corresponds to a stabilized Au(III) precursor formed under basic conditions
(seeMethods for details); the use of K-gold increases
the reduction potential of Au(III) by ∼0.45 V compared to that
of Au(III) from HAuCl4.35 This
approach, illustrated in Scheme 1, offers a unique and effective strategy for the galvanic
reaction of Au ions with Pd templates.

K-gold and KI are necessary
for the galvanic reaction.

Methods
Materials
Potassium tetrachloropalladate (K2PdCl4,
99%; STREM Chemicals), hydrogen tetrachloroaurate(III)
hydrate (HAuCl4, 99.99%; STREM Chemicals), l-ascorbic
acid (AA, 99%; Sigma-Aldrich), cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB,
98%; Amresco), hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37%; Macron Fine Chemicals),
nitric acid (HNO3, 68–70%; Macron Fine Chemicals),
and anhydrous potassium carbonate (J.T. Baker) were purchased from
the indicated suppliers. Water was purified to a resistivity of 18.2
MΩ·cm (Academic Milli-Q Water System; Millipore Corp.).
All glassware was cleaned with aqua regia solution (HCl/HNO3; 3:1), thoroughly rinsed with Millipore water, and dried prior to
use.

Pd NC Seed Synthesis
The Pd NC seed solution was synthesized
by reduction of K2PdCl4 by AA. A total of 24.0
mL of CTAB solution (50 mM) was prepared by dissolving 437 mg of CTAB
in 24.0 mL of Millipore water under vigorous stirring in a 50 mL round
bottom flask suspended in an oil bath, followed by the initiation
of refluxing at 100 °C. To this solution, while still refluxing,
10.0 mL of K2PdCl4 (5 mM; aqueous solution)
and 1.00 mL of AA (300 mM; aqueous solution) were added and kept under
constant stirring for 5 h. The resulting suspension was cooled to
room temperature and centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 20 min, followed
by decantation of the supernatant and redispersion in 10.0 mL of Millipore
water. The centrifugation process was repeated two times. The resulting
Pd NC seed suspension had a concentration of 1.31 × 1011 particles/mL.

Pd NC Synthesis
A 60.0 mL sample
of 50 mM CTAB solution
was prepared by adding 1.09 g of CTAB in 60.0 mL of Millipore water
with vigorous stirring at 40 °C. Once the CTAB was completely
dissolved, 6.00 mL of K2PdCl4 (5 mM) and 1.20
mL of aqueous HCl (100 mM) were added to the solution. After waiting
for 5 min, 480 μL of Pd NC seeding solution was added. Finally,
600 μL of aqueous AA solution (100 mM) was added. The resulting
solution was vigorously stirred, and the temperature was maintained
at 40 °C for 4 h in an oil bath. The prepared Pd NCs were washed
with Millipore water and centrifuged two times at 6000 rpm for 10
min, followed by decantation of the supernatant and redispersion in
45.0 mL of Millipore water. The resulting NC suspension had a concentration
of 5.87 × 109 particles/mL, and the synthesized Pd
NCs had an average edge length of 85 nm.

To synthesize different
sizes of Pd NCs, we followed the same synthetic procedure but with
differing amounts of Pd NC seed solution added. A 500 μL aliquot
of Pd NC seed solution was used to obtain Pd NCs with an average edge
length of 65 nm, whereas 450 μL of Pd NC seed solution was added
to obtain Pd NCs with an average edge length of 105 nm.

Preparation
of K-Gold Solution
A solution containing
a reducible gold salt (K-gold solution) was first prepared by dissolving
30.0 mg of anhydrous potassium carbonate in 100 mL of Millipore water.
After 5 min of stirring, 2 mL of 1 wt % HAuCl4 aqueous
solution was added to the potassium carbonate solution, which was
then stirred for 2 h to form a colorless solution. The K-gold solution
was then aged at 4 °C in darkness for a minimum of 2 days.

Galvanic Replacement of Pd with K-Gold
Au nanocages
were synthesized by galvanic replacement of Pd with Au. In a standard
procedure, 6.00 mL of Pd NC solution, 300 μL of KI (from a 5
mM KI solution), and 50 mg of CTAB were added to a 40 mL vial. This
mixture was heated to 50 °C in an oil bath with constant stirring
at 400 rpm and kept at that temperature for 30 min. A 4.00 mL aliquot
of K-gold solution was then added to the flask, the temperature was
raised to 80 °C, and this temperature was maintained for 1.5
h. The resulting solution was then centrifuged at 5000 rpm, the supernatant
was decanted, and the particles were redispersed in Millipore water.
This procedure was repeated two times with the as-synthesized Pd@Au
nanocages being redispersed in 6.00 mL of Millipore water.

The
amount of added KI and K-gold influences the course of the galvanic
replacement reaction. Four representative samples of the Pd@Au nanocages
(4 stages) were synthesized to illustrate the process of nanocage
growth during the galvanic reaction. Also, an Au nanoframe was prepared
by expanding the size of the facial openings of the nanocage as compared
to that of the third-stage nanocage (Pd@Au 3). Separately,
a Pd@Au nanoparticle having a spherical shape was synthesized using
relatively large amounts of KI and K-gold. The reactants needed to
prepare the nanoparticles representing the four stages of nanocage
growth as well as the nanoframes and nanospheres are summarized in Table S2.

Characterization
The morphology of the nanoparticles
was evaluated using a FEI-235 scanning electron microscope (SEM),
operating at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. To obtain high-resolution
(HR) SEM images, all samples were deposited on silicon wafers. Transmission
electron microscopes (TEMs); FEI G2, JEOL 2000 FX, and JEM 2010 equipped
with energy-dispersive spectrometers; were operated at either 100
or 200 kV. Conventional and HR TEM imaging, selected area electron
diffraction (SAED), and EDX spectroscopy, including elemental mapping
methods, were used for analysis of the nanoparticles. All TEM samples
were deposited on 300 mesh holey carbon-coated copper grids and dried
before analysis. UV–visible (UV–vis) extinction spectra
were obtained using a Cary 50 Scan UV–vis spectrometer over
the wavelength range of 200–1100 nm. A Siemens D-5000 powder
X-ray diffractometer equipped with a monochromatic Cu Kα (λ
= 1.540562 Å) radiation source was used to analyze the samples
over the 2θ range 5–90° in steps of 0.02°.
The concentrations of the suspensions at each step of the synthesis
procedure were measured with a Malvern Instruments NanoSight NS300
nanoparticle tracking system.

Results and Discussion
We synthesized the template Pd NCs using seed-mediated growth (see Figure S1 for TEM images of the Pd “seeds”).
The procedure successfully produced Pd NCs with sharp edges and corners. Figures 1A,F show the TEM
and SEM images, respectively, for the 105 nm Pd NCs used for the preparation
of the nanocages; for the sake of simplicity, we provide a cartoon
illustration above each set of images (i.e., Illustration 0 corresponds
to the Pd NCs in Figures 1A,F). The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern in Figure S2 shows an intense peak for the (200)
lattice of face-centered cubic (fcc, Fm3̅m (225)) crystalline Pd, which indicates most of the Pd
NCs preferentially oriented with {100} facets parallel to the deposition
surface.29 This pattern is consistent with
the formation of the sharp edges for our Pd NCs, which can also be
observed in the TEM images in Figure S1.

We then subjected the Pd NCs to galvanic replacement with
Au. To
determine the optimum reaction conditions, we undertook a systematic
study of the galvanic reaction by varying the amounts of KI and K-gold
solution to investigate the morphological changes during the galvanic
replacement process.13 After analyzing
the results from over 100 reactions, we noted several reaction products
in which changes in the amount of added KI and K-gold solution were
associated with a reaction pathway that included four stages of nanocage
development. Using the knowledge gained from these studies, we fixed
the reaction time at 1.5 h for all syntheses of the nanocages/nanoframes,
which was sufficient for complete reaction. Additionally, K-gold was
used as our limiting reagent, an approach similar to the strategies
used in prior reports.5,14 Furthermore, we added only a
moderate excess of KI for each reaction. The reactants used for each
of the synthesized nanostructures are summarized in Table S2, and the corresponding results are displayed in Figure 1. The illustrations
on the top row show the growth of the nanocages as a function of increasing
amount of added K-gold/KI solution. The illustrations are consistent
with the EDX mapping analyses for each stage (see Figure S3).

Figures 1B,G show,
respectively, the TEM and SEM images of nanocages formed during the
first stage of the galvanic replacement reaction (see also Illustration
1). Notably, dilute reactants (i.e., 50 μL of KI and 0.10 mL
of K-gold solution) generate a thin layer of Au that forms on the
surface of the Pd template as some of the Pd is initially oxidized.
This thin layer appears to plate preferentially on the templates starting
from the edges; according to our EDX data, this sample has only a
small amount of Au relative to Pd (see Table S1). Prior investigators hypothesized that the galvanic reaction proceeds
by interdiffusion of core metal atoms to the surface of the nanocages
at the early stages of the replacement reaction to form an Au–Pd
bimetallic shell.34,39

At higher reactant concentrations
(i.e., 250 μL of KI and
1.00 mL of K-gold solution), which reflect the second stage of the
galvanic reaction, Au continues to replace Pd on the outermost layer
of the nanocages. The diffused Pd atoms in the growing shell oxidize,
and pinholes begin to form on the faces of the template structures,
as shown in Figures 1C,H (see Illustration 2), allowing ions to diffuse from the core.14 A previous study showed that iodide ions, when
used in conjunction with CTAB, act as capping agents on the various
facets of Pd, with the adsorption of these ions leading to the following
order of surface energies for the crystallographic planes: {111} >
{100} > {110}.40 Therefore, the presence
of KI influences the morphology of the nanocages over the course of
the galvanic reaction. Herein, we take advantage of this reactivity
of I–, which plausibly helps activate the Pd atoms
in the {111} facets (and perhaps the {100} facets) for oxidation and/or
diffusion. Additionally, researchers have suggested that the generated
electrons from the cathodic reaction migrate to the surface and the
incoming Au atoms are initially kinetically favored to deposit on
sharp edges and corners, which have higher surface free energies.41,42 This phenomenon leads to the formation of a concave-type structure
with sharp edges and corners. All of the above contribute to a key
feature of our synthesis method: the size of the openings that develop
at the center of the faces of the nanocages can be tuned by changing
the amount of K-gold precursor solution used. To this end, we used
300 μL of KI and 4.00 mL of K-gold solution to illustrate the
products at the third stage of the galvanic reaction (see Figures 1D,I; Illustration
3). Importantly, the formation of nanocages can be redirected to produce
nanoframes instead by further increasing the K-gold solution used
to 5.00 mL (see Figure 2).

In the final stage of the galvanic reaction, induced by
using 500
μL of KI and 10.0 mL of K-gold solution (see Figures 1E,J; Illustration 4), we observe
a total disappearance of the openings in the faces of the nanocages
as the particles develop continuous shells. According to the EDX data
(Table S1), the amount of Pd in the structure
remains substantial, which indicates that closure of the openings
can take place earlier than that reported in previous studies with
Au–Ag nanocages.14 This phenomenon
can be attributed to the different stoichiometries of the galvanic
reactions for Au/Pd as compared to those for Au/Ag.

According
to eq 1,
three Pd0 atoms are oxidized to reduce two atoms of Au3+. For the Au–Ag system, three silver atoms are oxidized
by one Au3+ ion. Therefore, the oxidation of Pd engenders
the deposition of a larger volume of Au and, consequently, the gold
shell develops with a significant amount of Pd remaining underneath.
Importantly, Pd NPs have been shown to be biocompatible in biomedical
applications.22−24 Also, the presence of Pd in the nanocage skeleton
is known to increase the stability of nanoparticles at low pH.43 Further, the metals in Pd-coated Au NCs remain
separated upon heating to temperatures greater than 250 °C.44 Moreover, studies of Pd–Au bimetallic
clusters have found the Pd-core/Au-shell structure to be the most
stable upon annealing at elevated temperatures.45 However, one downside is that the presence of Pd decreases
the photothermal efficiency of the corresponding nanostructures. Future
studies will explore a suitable etching process to reduce the remaining
Pd and enhance the plasmonic efficiency. 1  

To gain further insight
into the evolution of the Pd@Au nanocages,
we recorded extinction spectra of the nanocages over the four stages
of galvanic replacement. The extinction spectra in Figure 3 are normalized, which is a
common practice when reporting the spectra of nanoboxes and nanocages.5 The absolute extinction spectra (i.e., without
normalization) are provided in Figure S4. Figure 3A shows
that the extinction maxima shift from 540 to 785 nm with increasing
K-gold reactant up to a point (i.e., with the formation of Pd@Au 3 as optimized nanocages), whereas the use of 10.0 mL of K-gold
produced nanocages with shorter extinction wavelengths (Pd@Au 4). The latter phenomenon arises from the deposition of a
thick gold shell, which leads to the disappearance of sharp edges
and the concave shape (as shown in Figures 1E,J). The nanoframe structure is produced
with a moderate increase in K-gold solution as compared to that in
Pd@Au 3, and it has a similar extinction band to that
of Pd@Au 3 (see Figure S5).
In addition, the presence of residual Pd in Au nanostructures can
plausibly give rise to broadening of the extinction band, not only
due to the differing positions of the extinction maxima for these
two metals,46 but also due to plasmon damping
caused by the incorporation of Pd.31 Evidence
of the latter can be seen by comparing the broad band for the initial
Pd@Au to the narrower band for Pd@Au 4 (decreasing ratio
of Pd/Au).

vs the volume of K-gold solution, as compared to the atomic percentage
of Au in these nanostructures after each galvanic reaction, as measured
by EDX (see Tables S1 and S2 for additional details).

To gain a better understanding
of the processes involved, we plotted
the EDX results in Figure 3B to show that the galvanic reaction continued to take place
even as the opening to the interior void closed, giving rise to a
thickening of the gold shell. We also provided the composition of
the individual Pd@Au nanocages using our EDX data, and the details
are provided in Table S1. Despite the encapsulation
of the initial template, the Au plating can proceed further with the
addition of even greater amounts of K-gold, eventually forming spherical
nanoparticles; these particles are shown in Figure S6.

Analysis of our nanocages by EDX indicates the presence
of only
Au and Pd in these particles (see Figure S7). Furthermore, Figure 4 provides the characterization
of the optically optimized Pd@Au 3 nanocages by TEM and
EDX. Specifically, Figures 4B–D provide the mapping images, and Figure 5E provides the EDX line profiles
recorded from the individual Pd@Au 3 nanocage shown in Figure 4A along the diagonal
direction of the face of the cube. These data show that the outer
corners and edges exhibited high Au content, whereas the core is essentially
hollow, with Pd predominating in the inner shell of the cage structure.

reference patterns for Au and Pd are provided (both structures are

pattern recorded from an individual nanocage.

For a more comprehensive investigation of this unique nanostructure,
we provide the powder XRD pattern of the Pd@Au 3 nanocages
to illustrate the crystal structures of the metal components. Figure 5A depicts a single
crystalline fcc cubic structure. The Pd and Au diffraction peaks match
those reported for a bimetallic Au–Pd system in which the metals
are separated rather than alloyed,37,44 which strongly
suggests that gold and palladium are separated in our nanocages (which
is further consistent with the NIR positioning of their extinction
maximum). Also, the SAED patterns in Figure 5B recorded from Pd@Au 3 nanocages
confirm that they are single crystals, their symmetry is Fm3̅m, and there is no superlattice ordering
of Au or Pd. Also, the SAED pattern shows one set of spots, which
confirms that each crystalline component is perfectly overlapped (i.e.,
during galvanic replacement, the Pd serves as a template to grow the
overlying gold layer, and the deposited gold atoms align exactly with
the Pd atoms).

Mie theory predicts that a change in the size
of nanoparticles
causes a shift in their extinction maximum.47,48 As we sought to produce hollow nanostructures that absorb/scatter
light in the NIR, we chose to investigate this aspect of modulating
the nanocage design. To this end, we synthesized the Pd@Au nanocages
in three different sizes to determine how particle size impacts the
optical properties. We started with three sizes of Pd NCs (average
edge lengths of 65, 85, and 105 nm) as sacrificial templates for galvanic
replacement, as shown in the TEM images in Figure S1. Figures 6A–C show the TEM images of Pd@Au nanocages after galvanic
replacement of the Pd templates. Importantly, the extinction spectra
in Figure 6D show that
our efforts to use nanocage size to modulate the positioning of the
extinction maximum allowed us to tune the extinction band from 570
to 785 nm.

templates, (B) 85 nm Pd templates, and (C) 105 nm Pd templates. All

Conclusions
In
summary, we demonstrated a simple and efficient method for the
synthesis of hollow Pd-templated Au nanocages (and nanoframes) that
adsorb/scatter light in the NIR. With our approach, we avoided the
use of silver templates that are known to be toxic and unstable for
biological applications. We investigated the changes in the morphology
of the nanocages at different stages of the galvanic replacement reaction.
Our results lead us to believe that these Pd@Au nanocages have the
potential for application in the fields of drug delivery, optical
sensing, and photothermal therapy, owing to their tunable extinction
maxima as well as their high surface areas. The new synthesis procedure
reported herein can be easily scaled up and will play a key role in
the development of hollow nanostructures for biological applications.
In-depth evaluations of the stability and toxicity of these unique
nanostructures are planned in the near future.
