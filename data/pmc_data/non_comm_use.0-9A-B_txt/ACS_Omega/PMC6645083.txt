Hierarchical
nickel nanowires (h-NiNWs) were synthesized by a simple
reduction method and their electrical, magnetic, and electromagnetic
characteristics were investigated. These nanowires possess a high
magnetic saturation (Ms) of 51 emu/g and
also a coercivity (Hc) of 34.5 Oe, which
makes them suitable for soft magnetic sensor applications. Hall transport
is being reported for the first time for h-NiNWs, and electrical conductivity
at room temperature was studied to assess their applicability as a
Hall sensor wherein the Hall coefficient RH was found to be −1.39 × 10–12 Ω
cm/Oe. Electromagnetic characterization of synthesized h-NiNWs shows
excellent microwave shielding effectiveness of above 24 dB for the
Ku band (12.4–18 GHz) and a maximum value of 32 dB at 14 GHz
for a sample with a thickness of about 1 mm. A room-temperature-curable
screen-printable ink was formulated using the synthesized magnetic
nanostructures and printed on different flexible substrates. Printed
patterns show promising ferromagnetic properties, and they could be
potential candidates for soft magnetic sensor applications.

1 Introduction
Controlled
growth of magnetic nanomaterials finds several cutting-edge
applications, owing to their size- and shape-dependent properties.
These applications mainly spread across the domains of magnetic recording
memories,1 microwave absorption,2 magnetic field sensing,3,4 pathogen
capture,5 cancer theranostics,6,7 fluid pumping,8−10 magnetic levitation,11 bioelectrochemical sensing,12 and actuation.13 Magnetic field sensors, which convert magnetic
or magnetically encoded information into electrical signals, are essentially
based on two important principles, viz., magneto resistance and Hall
effect. For sensing the position, velocity, or directional movement
in automotive systems, soft magnetic materials are extensively used,
which demand low coercivity and hysteresis. These kinds of sensors
are also elaborately employed in electronic circuits due to their
contactless wear-free operation, low maintenance, and robust design.14−17 Conventional sensor fabrication demands expensive physical deposition
techniques such as ion beam deposition or photolithography.18,19 Unlike the traditional lithography that involves time-consuming
and costly procedures, the printed electronics, which has been a fast
emerging technology over the last few years, requires simple printing
steps for device fabrication.20,21

Ferromagnetic
metals like iron, cobalt, and nickel are ideal candidates
for soft magnetic applications. In these applications, magnetic behavior
is characterized mainly by magnetic anisotropy, besides exchange interaction.
For example, ferromagnetic two-dimensional nanosheets are responsible
for in-plane anisotropy, whereas nanowires have axis-dependent directional
anisotropy, However, in magnetic nanoparticles, no specific orientation
is favored.22 Magnetic nanostructures could
be fine-tuned to make them suitable in myriad areas of applications.
Among the ferromagnetic nanostructures, nickel is a prominent candidate
for soft sensor applications, which has less oxidation problems compared
with other ferromagnetic counterparts. Earlier, various morphologies
of nickel-based structures have been synthesized like nanoparticles,23 nanoshells,24 nanowires,25 nanoflowers,26 nanocarpets,27 and nanoparticle chains.28 Different chemical and physical techniques have been employed;
however, electrodeposition was being chosen as the most widely preferred
one for fabrication of nickel nanowire (NiNW) arrays.29−31 Tabasum et al. developed a new method for synthesizing nickel nanowires
and nanotubes by electrodeposition using polycarbonate templates.32 Ferromagnetic nanotubes with customized dimensions
can also be fabricated by atomic layer deposition using nanoporous
alumina membranes having different pore diameters.33 However, template-based methods have been discouraged these
days because templates need to be removed prior to employ the nanostructures
for real applications. In 2009, Liu and co-workers demonstrated an
alternate template-free method to synthesize nickel nanowires under
the influence of magnetic field.34 The
field-induced nanowire growth mechanism is well understood now based
on the principle that a magnetic field applied during the chemical
reaction can strengthen the magnetic dipole interaction among the
magnetic nanoparticles, which in turn synchronously influences both
the nucleation and the parallel growth of nickel nanostructures.35,36 Besides, it was further revealed that the nanowire chain lengths
can be tailored by adjusting the pH value and reaction temperature.37 Magnetic induction syntheses were also reported
for the fabrication of magnetic nanowires at ambient conditions. For
example, Li et al. in 2015 reported the synthesis of Ni nanowires
through the self-assembly mechanism assisted by an external magnetic
field as a shape control agent.38

In 2004, Liu et al. reported the synthesis of hierarchical NiNWs
(h-NiNWs) through a self-assembled network of pure Ni nanochains prepared
by a simple solution-phase method.39 In
2007, Ni and co-authors asserted that the formation mechanism of the
unique hierarchical structure of NiNWs could be ascribed to the combined
effect of precursor reagents, reaction rate, and inherent magnetic
interactions.40 Sarkar et al. described
the synthesis of prickly nickel nanowires using a stabilizer-assisted
method.41 In 2011, Pradeep and his co-workers
introduced a unique surfactant-free wet chemical synthesis to produce
high-purity hierarchical nickel nanowires (h-NiNWs) with various aspect
ratios.42 They even demonstrated the surface-enhanced
Raman spectra activity of these pristine hierarchical nanowires. Sooner,
Tang et al., while synthesizing NiNWs through a microwave-assisted
polyol route, observed that nanowires have rough surfaces at low precursor
concentrations but become smoother at high concentrations.43 In 2016, Xia and Wen optimized the large-scale
synthesis conditions of h-NiNWs and found that the size and morphology
of NiNWs can be tailored by adjusting the reaction temperature, time
length, and surfactant concentration.44 Logutenko et al. also made a similar observation wherein a decrease
in the nickel precursor concentration resulted in a decrease in diameters
of the nanowires.45

Despite these
reports, there have been only very few isolated works
aimed to employ these hierarchical nanowires for practical applications.
For example, in 2016, the electrical conductivity of h-NiNWs was explored
by Kim et al., who fabricated high-performance transparent electrodes
based on nickel nanowires.46 The microwave
absorbing properties of solvothermally derived hierarchical nickel
nanochains were also investigated.47 In
short, for NiNWs, several of the all-important soft magnetic sensing
applications including Hall effect sensing were largely unexplored,
which was undertaken in the present work. Herein, we developed a large-scale
synthesis protocol for hierarchical nickel nanowires and the electrical,
thermal, magnetic, and electromagnetic properties of the synthesized
nanostructures were investigated. The screen printing of hierarchical
nickel nanowires using a room-temperature-curable screen-printable
h-NiNW ink on flexible substrates like (biaxially oriented poly(ethylene
terephthalate) (BoPET)) and cellulose has also been demonstrated,
and their magnetic response was discussed.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Mechanism of Hierarchical
Nanowire Formation
The present work describes a one-step
process for the reduction
of nickel salt by a strong reducing agent.48 We synthesized hierarchical nickel nanostructures by reducing NiCl2·H2O with hydrazine hydrate. Large-scale synthesis
of the nanostructures has been optimized. The reaction mechanism can
be explained by the following equation 1  Figure 1 shows the growth mechanism of hierarchical
NiNWs. The mechanism
of formation of the nanowire structure can be explained as a consequence
of the alignment of nickel nanoparticles in a specific crystallographic
direction. Ethylene glycol functions as a dispersant as well as a
solvent in the current preparation method. The occurrence of small
magnetic nuclei is favored by the dispersing action of ethylene glycol.
Each small nucleus grows into high-surface-area structures, which
are not thermodynamically favorable. To reduce the number of interfaces,
the nanoparticles get attached to each other and grow like the stems
of plants. Because the small nanoparticles formed are also magnetic,
they provide an inherent magnetic field that allows magnetic particles
to get self-assembled with each other like tiny magnets, forming a
chainlike structure. The magnetic dipolar interaction also plays a
role in the growth of nanowires along a particular direction. The
formation of acicular structures occurs at positions where two particles
join each other, which may be explained by a Cayley tree model.39 In Cayley trees, the adjoining of two branches
leads to the formation of acicular structures.2 During the growth process, the surface area is reduced, which makes
the nanowires thermodynamically more stable.

method.

2.2 Structural
and Morphological Analysis of Hierarchical
NiNWs
Figure 2a shows the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of as-synthesized
nanostructures. XRD could be well indexed with JCPDS file no: 00-004-085.
The nickel nanowires exhibit a face-centered cubic (fcc) structure
with good phase purity. No trace of nickel oxide was observed within
the detection limits of XRD. The texture coefficient of each plane
can be calculated from XRD using Harris’s analysis as given
by the equation49 2  where I(hikili) represents the
peak intensity
corresponding to the ith plane in the powder diffraction
data and Io(hikili) represents the peak intensity corresponding
to the same plane in the JCPDS file. For fcc nickel, three planes
are considered here, which are at 2θ = 44.50, 51.85, and 76.38°,
and hence the value of n is equal to 3. For a polycrystalline
sample, the orientation of individual crystallites plays a major role
in determining the physical properties. The texture coefficient defines
the preferred direction of orientation of individual crystallites
in a polycrystalline sample. If there exists a plane whose texture
coefficient is greater than 1.0, the crystal is said to be preferentially
oriented in that direction. In the present case, the value of texture
coefficient for the (111) plane is 1.18, whereas that of the (200)
plane is 0.96 and the (220) plane has a value of 0.85. Hence, we believe
that h-NiNWs have a preferred orientation along the (111) plane, which
is consistent with earlier studies as well.50 In template-grown nanowires, the texture plays a significant role
in controlling the magnetic properties. The crystallite size also
plays a major role in determining the magnetic properties like saturation
magnetization and coercivity. The crystallite size can be estimated
from the Debye–Scherrer equation 3  where
λ is the wavelength of Cu Kα
radiation used for diffraction, β is the full width at half-maximum,
and K defines the shape factor. The average crystallite
size is obtained as 39 nm, computed using the major X-ray diffraction
peaks.

scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of synthesized structures drop-casted
on carbon film; (c) bright field transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) of long h-NiNWs; (d) TEM of h-NiNWs showing nanothorns grown
radially outward on the surface of wires; (e) energy-dispersive X-ray
pattern of h-NiNWs; and (f) selected-area diffraction (SAED) pattern
for the polycrystalline sample.

Figure 2b
represents
the SEM of the h-NiNW suspensions drop-casted over a microslide and
dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C, whereas Figure 2c represents the transmission electron micrograph
of h-NiNW drop-casted on a carbon-coated copper grid. Evidently, the
h-NiNW surfaces are packed with spiky thorns that resemble the stems
of a rose plant. These thorns appear standing along the radial direction
on the nanowire surfaces. The average length of the thorns appears
to be less than 100 nm, whereas the wire diameters lie in the range
of 150–300 nm (see Figure 2d), with lengths on the order of a few micrometers. Figure 2e represents the
energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy of the prepared nanostructures.
The Ni L and Ni K energy peaks are believed to be signatures for the
formation of phase-pure nickel nanowires. A small peak for O K may
be due to surface oxidation, and C and Cu peaks are arising out of
the TEM grid. Figure 2f represents the selected-area diffraction (SAED) pattern of hierarchical
NiNWs. The bright spots with ringlike structures appear in SAED, as
for any polycrystalline sample. All of the major peaks in the diffraction
pattern were indexed, which represent the fcc-structured nickel. Figure S1 shows the analysis of the chemical
state of h-NiNWs by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement,
which was recorded after a period of 4 weeks since its synthesis.
The binding energies of Ni 2p1/2 and Ni 2p3/2 of the Ni 2p doublet, shown at 870.4 and 853.3 eV, respectively,
indicate the surface oxidation of nickel (Ni2+). Satellite
lines are observed at 873.6 and 857.3 eV for Ni 2p1/2 and
Ni 2p3/2 components, respectively, which characterize Ni2+ ions. It is evident that the surface of h-NiNWs may get
oxidized in an oxygen atmosphere when kept for a period of 4 weeks,
which is understandable because nickel exhibits one of the highest
parabolic oxidation rate constants among the corrosion resistant metals.

2.3 Magnetic Properties of h-NiNWs
Figure 3a,b represents the
hysteresis loops at 10 and 300 K. Magnetocrystalline anisotropy is
less for fcc-structured Ni compared to that for magnetic counterparts
like rare-earth-based materials because strong spin–orbit coupling
is exhibited by rare-earth elements, which is attributed to their
heavy nature.51 Magnetic measurements are
carried out for field sweep from −5 to 5 T. The magnetic properties
of the nickel nanowires were found to be better than those of spherical
Ni nanoparticles because of the shape anisotropy effect.52 Nonspherical samples have different amounts
of magnetization for different directions, and the magnetization would
be larger along the long axis. In general, the shape anisotropy constant
can be defined as c/a, wherein c denotes the length of the nanostructure and a denotes the radius of the nanostructures.51 The excellent magnetic sensing of the as-synthesized nanowires in
the presence of a laboratory bar magnet is showcased in Video SV1. The saturation magnetization at 300
K is lower than that obtained at 10 K due to the contribution from
local surface anisotropy at low temperatures arising from the frozen
surface spins.53 The thermal influence
on magnetism is less evident at low temperatures where the applied
magnetic field could be utilized completely for aligning the spins
without any thermally induced random motions. Figure 3c represents the M–T curve of the synthesized nickel nanowires from 300 to
700 K at 200 Oe. The Curie temperature (Tc) of the nanostructures is found to be 614 K, as seen in Figure 3d, which is lower
than that of the bulk Ni (627 K).54 The
reduction in Curie temperature can be attributed to an increase in
the disorder of magnetic moments as well as the increase in the number
of interfaces with size reduction. Hence, the thermal energy may overcome
the magnetic ordering at a still lower temperature than for the bulk
nickel (∼629 K). The low temperature behavior of ferromagnetic
materials could be specified by Bloch’s equation55 4  where M(T) and M(0) denote the
saturation magnetization at
temperatures T and 0 K and Bloch’s constant
λ = 3/2. As the temperature increases, there is a reduction
in saturation, and after the Curie temperature is reached, the nanostructures
undergo transition to a paramagnetic state. Figure 3e depicts the digital photograph taken for
h-NiNWs dispersed in distilled water. As shown, when a magnet is introduced,
the sample gets attracted to the magnet due to high magnetic saturation
(see Figure 3f).

h-NiNWs, (d) plot of dM/dT Vs temperature

and (f) magnetic response of h-NiNWs in the presence of a bar magnet.

In the present investigation,
we have tested magnetic properties
of hierarchical nickel nanowires in two different forms: (a) hierarchical
nickel nanowire powder and (b) powder consolidated into a pellet by
forming in a uniaxial press under a pressure of 150 MPa. Figure 4 depicts the M–H hysteresis curve of hierarchical
NiNWs recorded after 30 days of preparation, and data taken at 300
K clearly demonstrate their ferromagnetic nature with magnetic saturation
(Ms) value of 49 emu/g and remnant magnetization Mr of 12.9 emu/g. The bulk Ni exhibits a saturation
value of 55 emu/g. The lowering of Ms is
suspected to be due to surface oxidation. This magnetization value
is found to be better than that reported in the literature for prickly
nickel nanowires.56 From Figure 4a, one could estimate that
the hierarchical nickel nanowires have a squareness value of 0.263
and coercivity of 175 Oe. Ultrathin nanowires are likely to be single
crystalline and hence their coercivity is dictated by the wire diameter.
When the wire diameter increases, the number of magnetic domains within
the particle increases, which results in lower coercivity values.
The hierarchical nanowires in the present study could be considered
as multidomain systems, with nanowires and nanothorns oriented in
different directions. We have done measurements both in powder and
consolidated pellet forms. When the magnetic measurements are performed
for the powder form where a large number of hierarchical wires are
present with diverse orientations, the magnetic interaction between
them plays a role in assuming lower coercivity values.57

Figure 4 (a) M–H of powder
and
pellet forms of nickel nanostructures at 300 K and (b) hysteresis
loops magnified between −300 and +300 Oe, for the h-NiNW powder
and pellet.

On the other hand, when
the magnetic properties of pelletized hierarchical
nickel nanowires were tested, we found that saturation magnetization
increased to 51.5 emu/g, whereas remnant magnetization decreased to
3.55 emu/g. The squareness of consolidated h-NiNWs is found to be
0.068. This phenomenon can be explained by considering the interparticle
interaction among magnetic nanostructures. Furthermore, the coercivity
of the consolidated h-NiNW is 34.5 Oe, which is considerably lower
compared to that of the powder (175 Oe). The coercivity reduction
is also believed to be due to the magnetostatic interparticle interaction.51 This is because a magnetic particle exerts a
field around its neighboring particles, which assists them to be magnetized
using a lesser field than that is actually required. As the packing
density increases, the interparticle interaction increases and hence
a lowering of the coercivity results.

2.4 Electrical
and Thermal Conductivity of the
Nickel Nanostructures
The direct current (dc) electrical
properties of the nickel nanostructure can be explored by the four-probe
method (see Figure S2). Here, the two current
probes were connected at the outer ends of the preheated rectangular
pellets and the voltage probes were connected at the inner ends of
the rectangular block. When current was varied from 0.1 to 1.1 A,
the voltage developed across the inner leads was measured. The plotted
graph shown in Figure 5a exhibited a linear nature, typical of any conducting metallic structure.
The conductivity of the nanostructures is obtained using eqs 14 and 15 in the Experimental Section.

Figure 5 (a) I–V plot of Ni at
300 K and (b) thermal conductivity vs temperature for 180–330
K.

The dc conductivity value of h-NiNWs
was found to be 2.19 ×
106 S/m, whereas the conductivity value reported for bulk
nickel was 1.43 × 107 S/m.54 The reduction in electrical conductivity can be attributed to the
surface oxidation in the h-NiNWs and the increased surface scattering
due to the decrease in size. In spite of this, the h-NiNWs exhibit
better conductivity than the nanoparticles due to the connectivity
of the one-dimensional structures. The electrons can travel with less
scattering for a long distance in a nanowire compared with a nanoparticle
where they need to transit from one nanoparticle to another and hence
the increase in the number of interfaces contributes to the reduced
conductivity.

Figure 5b represents
the thermal conductivity of the nickel samples measured by a thermal
transport system (TTO) probe from 180 to 350 K. Heat transport in
magnetic materials may be mediated by magnons and phonons. Obviously,
the thermal conductivity in a metallic conductor has electronic contribution
in addition to phonon contribution. The electronic contribution has
been dominant for metallic particles like Ni. Magnon transport is
influenced by the arrangement of domain walls as well as applied magnetic
fields as this may cause magnon scattering. The reason for an increasing
trend in thermal conductivity for polycrystalline nanowires in the
low-temperature region was already reported in the literature (4–150
K), which was explained to be due to the presence of spare domain
walls.58 In Figure 5b, for applied temperatures of 180–350
K, the magnon scattering may cause a decrease in thermal conductivity
with increasing temperature. A similar trend has been reported earlier
for magnetic nanowires also.58 The thermal
conductivity of the structures was found to be 33 W/m K at room temperature,
which is very much less than the reported value of bulk Ni (90 W/m
K) but comparable with that reported for a nickel nanowire (22 W/m
K).59 The reduction in thermal conductivity
occurred due to the increased surface scattering caused by the increased
number of interfaces in the h-NiNWs. The presence of porosity in the
tested sample can also contribute toward the lowering of thermal conductivity.

2.5 Hall Effect Measurement of Nickel Nanostructures
Hall effect measurements of nickel nanowires have been schematically
shown in Figure 6a.
A planar Hall effect has been reported earlier for nickel, and this
effect was used for detecting magnetic microbeads; the Hall effect
plays a major role in determining the magnetic sensor applications.18,60 This has an important medical application as it can be used to detect
magnetic structures attached to various drug delivery systems for
targeting specific affected sites. The transverse voltage developed
across a semiconductor or conductor by the application of a magnetic
field in a direction perpendicular to the current flow is called the
Hall voltage. The applied magnetic field deflects the charge carriers,
which results in the development of Hall voltage (VH), and the phenomenon is termed as Hall effect.61 The corresponding resistance is the Hall resistance.
The Hall effect measurement setup can be used to calculate the concentration
of the charge carriers (n), Hall coefficient (RH), and their mobility (μ). In the present
case, Hall resistances for magnetic fields from −9 to +9 T
were measured, and Hall resistivity versus magnetic field data is
plotted in Figure 6b. The accurate values can be obtained from the equations 5   6  where t is the thickness
of the Hall specimen and ρxy is
the resistivity. The Hall coefficient can be calculated using the
equation 7  The slope of the
ρxy–B graph gives the magnitude
of the Hall coefficient.
A negative slope indicates the majority carrier as electrons, and
the concentration of charge carriers n can be obtained
by 8  The value of RH(58) is calculated to be −1.39 ×
10–12 Ω cm/Oe, which is comparable to that
reported for bulk Ni (−5.1 × 10–12 Ω
cm/Oe). The carrier concentration can be found to be 4.49 × 1028/m3.

measurement setup
and (b) Hall effect measurement using the four-probe method at 300
K for fields from −9 to +9 T.

2.6 Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) Shielding
of h-NiNWs
Interference of electromagnetic waves for communication
is considered to be a major road block in the era of information technology,
governed by a number of devices arranged in miniaturized chips. Metal
nanostructures provide a sustainable solution for this issue, which
hamper the effective data transmission between various devices in
the telecommunication industry. The hierarchical NiNWs were made in
the form of consolidated rectangular blocks and heat-treated at reducing
atmospheres, to give them a compact form. A promising electromagnetic
shield can be defined as a material with lower ac skin depth. The
skin depth of a material is the distance at which the amplitude of
the incoming radiation is reduced to 1/e times its
original wavelength.62 The skin depth δ
is given by 9  where f is the frequency
of the radiation, σ is the conductivity of the material, and
μ is the permeability of the material.

The permeability
of a ferromagnetic material can be calculated by the following equation63 10  Here, Ms represents
the magnetic saturation, Hc is the coercivity, k is called a proportion constant, a and b are constants that depend on the material, λ is
the magnetostriction constant, and ξ denotes the elastic strain
value in the crystal structure. As the saturation magnetization increases,
permeability also increases. The coercivity is also an important factor
that decides the permeability of the material. Thus, it became evident
that a better shield should have excellent conductivity and permeability.

Metal nanostructures are good solutions for EMI shielding due to
their superior electrical conductivity. The eddy current loss, a, of a conductor in an electromagnetic field is calculated
using the equation64 11  where d is the thickness,
μ0 is the permeability, and σ is the conductivity
of the material.

As the thickness d increases,
the eddy current
loss increases and thus the shielding effectiveness increases. But
an ideal EMI shield should have a thickness less than 2 mm for practical
purposes.65 Nickel is a ferromagnetic material
at room temperature and possesses good conductivity and permeability,
which are evident from the previous measurements.

The shielding
effectiveness of a material can be determined experimentally
using a transmission waveguide technique.66 The shielding effectiveness by absorption and reflection can be
calculated by equations 16 and 17.

The total shielding effectiveness is calculated as
the sum of both
the reflection and absorption shielding effectiveness. The reflection
effectiveness is contributed by the electrically conducting nature
of nickel nanowires. The mechanism of absorption shielding is due
to the magnetic and dielectric losses occurring when the electromagnetic
waves traverse through the material. Figure 7a represents the micrograph of porous rectangular
blocks of hierarchical NiNWs used for waveguide measurement, whose
results are given in Figure 7b. Figure 7c represents the schematic of the EMI shielding mechanism. As shown
in Figure 7c, the thorns
on the surface of the h-NiNWs act as antennas, which direct the incoming
electromagnetic waves toward the interior of the structure. As seen
from Figure 7a, hierarchical
NiNWs form well-connected structures, though highly porous as in the
case of foams. When electromagnetic waves enter into this kind of
connected structures, they suffer attenuation mainly by absorption.
The hierarchical nickel nanowires used in the present study exhibited
a total shielding effectiveness (SE) of about 24–32 dB in the
Ku band, as depicted in Figure 7b, which can shield 99% of the radiation incident on them
and can be a good choice as an EMI shielding material.

blocks of hierarchical NiNWs used
for waveguide measurement, (b) EMI shielding effectiveness of nickel
nanostructures for the Ku band measured using the waveguide method,
and (c) schematic of the EMI shielding mechanism in h-NiNWs.

2.7 Screen
Printing of Hierarchical NiNWs
2.7.1 Rheological
Properties of Nickel Ink
Translation of the above said properties
of hierarchical NiNWs into
any practical flexible electronic devices mainly depends on the success
of converting the nanostructures into a printable ink suspension.
Besides, it is also important to see how their magnetic properties
will get modified when we convert them into a thick film coating using
a conventional printing process. In the present study, we have adopted
a screen printing technique to realize the hierarchical nanowire coatings.

The screen printing ink can be characterized mainly by its rheological
properties such as viscosity that can be classified into static and
dynamic.67 The static properties include
viscosity and thixotropic behavior. Dynamic properties like viscoelasticity
(i.e., elastic-/solidlike (G′) or viscous-/liquidlike
(G″)) determine a good screen printing ink.
The viscosity of a printing ink can be described by the equation68 12  where η is the apparent viscosity, η0 is the viscosity at zero rate of shear, η∞ is the viscosity at infinite rate of shear, G is
the gradient of velocity, and α and n (2/3
> n > 1) are constants. Here, α is the
constant
that describes the creation or breaking of linkage between particles
in the ink that varies the viscosity and is responsible for pseudoplastic
nature as well. The viscosities of ink for lower filler concentrations
were found to be on the order of few mPa s and were beyond the measurement
limit for the cone and plate method, and such inks could not be screen-printed
due to their uncontrollable flow characteristics. A viscosity of 1–10
Pa s at lower shear rates is considered to be the optimum value for
screen printing. The viscosity, as depicted in Figure 8a for first scheme of ink formulation with
30 wt % filler loading and ethanol as solvent, follows a trend that
matches well with the equation and has viscosity in the desirable
range. The viscosity increased to a measureable form due to the increased
filler loading. Thus, the present formulation may be viewed as ideal
for printing applications. The increase in viscosity is attributed
to the increased interparticle connection, which reduces the flow
rate. In the first scheme of formulation, the use of poly(vinylpyrrolidone)
(PVP) helps in stabilizing the dispersion for printing. Ideal screen
printing inks exhibit pseudoplastic behavior, which is required to
control the postprinting flow characteristics.69,70 For elastic fluids, the viscosity increases with increased shear
rates as the resistance to flow increases. However, for pseudoplastic
fluids, the lower shear rates (<20 s–1) correspond
to the region of practical importance because most of the automatic
screen printers operate in this range. For the second scheme of ink
formulation, at higher shear rates, the increased viscosity can be
explained to be due to the room temperature drying of the bisolvent
system (see Figure S3). Fish oil comprises
a large number of fatty acids, which help in optimally dispersing
the filler system. With the increase in filler loading, high packing
density is attained; there is no adequate fluid in the ink to facilitate
the relative motion of particles, and, as expected, the viscosity
rises.71 The viscosity of an ink depends
on the viscosity of the solvent systems, which suspend the filler
particles. As the filler loading increases, the volume of the solvent
system in the formulated ink becomes insufficient to support the motion
of filler particles, thus giving an enhanced viscosity value for the
ink.

BoPET substrate, and (d) atomic force microscopy (AFM) of printed
hierarchical NiNWs on BoPET. The photographic image of the as-prepared
h-NiNW ink is shown in the inset of (a).

2.7.2 Morphological Studies of the Printed Pattern
Scanning electron microscopy of the printed samples exhibits uniform
packing of nickel nanowires as seen from Figure 8b,c. The nanowires along with the polymer
binder spread uniformly throughout the pattern. SEM images of the
printed pattern on a conventional paper and biaxially oriented poly(ethylene
terephthalate) (BoPET) are shown in Figure 8b,c whereas Figure 8d represents the AFM of the pattern printed
on BoPET. The surface roughness of the printed hierarchical NiNW-based
ink on the BoPET substrate was calculated using Nanoscope analysis
software as 180 nm. Obviously, the surface roughness is high due to
the uneven thorny structure of the nanowires.

2.7.3 Magnetic Characterization of the Printed
Pattern
Figure 9a shows the magnetic characterization of hierarchical NiNWs printed
on a paper and on BoPET for a magnetic field variation from −9
to +9 T at 300 K. When printed on a cellulose-based paper using an
ink with a filler loading of 30 wt %, the squareness increased to
0.3666 that may be due to dispersant effect of separating nickel nanowires.
The coercivity increased to 156.78 Oe, yet less than the coercivity
of the hierarchical NiNW powder, as given in Figure 9b. When printed on BoPET, squareness increased
to 0.398, whereas coercivity diminished to 145 Oe, which is lower
than the coercivities of the h-NiNW powder (Figure 9b) and that printed on a paper. These results
indicate that squareness improved on printing. Despite being porous
and showing thorny nanowire morphology, the hysteresis loops of the
printed patterns exhibit ferromagnetic nature, which qualifies them
to be used as an effective magnetic sensor. The performance of the
magnetic printed patterns with few micrometer thickness on these most
widely used flexible substrates shows promising applications in designing
wearable or rollable sensors. The biocompatibility and toxicity data
are also to be assessed to make them optimized for wearable sensor
applications.

3 Conclusions
Hierarchical
nickel nanostructures were synthesized using a simple
reduction method employing ethylene glycol. The developed structures
exhibited Ms of 51 emu/g, better electrical
conductivity (2.19 × 106 S/m), and an impressive thermal
conductivity of 33 W/m K even for a densification of about 40%. Even
with high porosity in the compacted form, the promising properties
of h-NiNWs are due to their effectively interconnected networks, similar
to a foam structure. Hence, the material in the present study may
be proposed as a good candidate for a soft magnetic sensor. EMI SE
of about 32 dB at 18 GHz qualifies them as a suitable candidate for
developing coatings for microwave shielding applications. Hall effect
measurements show that the nickel nanowires could be used for sensing
magnetic microbeads for biological applications and improvement of
sensitivity could be optimized by tuning the electrical resistivity,
the diameter, and aspect ratios of hierarchical structures. The novel
formulation of the screen-printable ink using these nanostructures
could make printing of magnetic devices for industrial applications.
Low-cost flexible magnetic sensors would be a reality with this kind
of magnetic printed structures replacing lithographically patterned
expensive magnetic thin films.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Nickel(II) chloride hexahydrate
(98%, Sigma-Aldrich), hydrazine hydrate (Merck), and ethylene glycol
(Merck) were utilized for h-NiNW synthesis. Poly(vinylpyrrolidone)
(PVP-40 000, Sigma-Aldrich), ethyl cellulose (Sigma-Aldrich),
absolute ethanol (Merck), fish oil (Arjuna Natural Extracts, Kerala,
India), poly(vinyl butyral) (Butvar-98, Sigma), and xylene (Sigma-Aldrich)
were used for ink formulation.

4.2 Template-free
Synthesis of Hierarchical Nickel
Nanowires
For the large-scale synthesis of hierarchical nickel
nanowires, 1 M nickel(II) chloride hexahydrate solution in water was
prepared by adding 5.9470 g of nickel salt in 25 mL of distilled water.
Then, 6 mL of prepared solution was added to a mixture of ethylene
glycol and water (in the volumetric ratio 3:1) to obtain a total amount
of 400 mL. This precursor was heated for 30 min to reach 120 °C,
followed by the addition of 24 mL of hydrazine hydrate solution to
obtain a blue solution, which instantly turns into dark blue and then
to a black network finally. The reaction was kept for 20 min for complete
reduction to occur. The black network was separated using a magnet
and washed with ethanol and water using a refrigerated centrifuge
at an rpm of 13 500 for 15 min. The resultant black precipitate
was dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 24 h.

4.3 Ink Formulation and Screen Printing
Ink formulation
was done for two types of solvent systems and thus
there are two schemes. In the first scheme of formulation, ethanol
was taken as a solvent, poly(vinylpyrrolidone) as a dispersant, and
ethyl cellulose as a binder. The loadings of the filler have been
varied from 15 to 20, 25, and 30 wt % with respect to the solvent.
Considering the ideal rheological characteristics, the filler loading
has been optimized as 30 wt %. The dispersant loading optimized was
10 wt %, whereas the binder was kept as 10 wt %. In an alternate formulation
scheme, the ink formulation consisted of ethanol/xylene as the vehicle,
poly(vinyl butyral) was used as the binder, whereas fish oil was used
as the dispersant. The binder loading has been fixed as 10 wt % with
respect to the filler loading. The dispersant is optimized to be 5
wt % of the filler loading. In this case also, the optimum filler
concentration obtained was 30 wt %. Proper mixing of ink’s
ingredients in the case of both formulations was ensured by ultrasonication
with a pulse frequency of 80 Hz. The formulated ink was printed with
the help of a screen printer (EKRA, Asys Group, Germany) using a 325-mesh
polyester/nylon screen. The ink was printed using three strokes on
rigid as well as flexible substrates. The second formulation delivered
better printed patterns on a paper substrate. The printed ink was
formulated so as to be dried at room temperature.

4.4 Characterization
The phase purity
of the synthesized h-NiNW was confirmed using X-ray diffraction with
Cu Kα radiation (Philips X’Pert PRO diffractometer, PANalytical,
Almelo, The Netherlands) of wavelength 1.54 nm. The morphology of
the synthesized hierarchical NiNWs was analyzed using a scanning electron
microscope (SEM, Zeiss EVO 18 Cryo SEM, Jena, Germany) operating at
an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. For this, samples were dispersed
in ethanol, drop-casted on a carbon tape, and dried in a vacuum oven
at 60 °C. The surface uniformity of the printed patterns was
also analyzed using SEM. The high-resolution imaging was done using
a transmission electron microscope (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2 30S-TWIN, FEI
Co., Hillsboro, OR). For this, samples dispersed in ethanol were drop-casted
on a carbon-coated TEM grid and dried in vacuum overnight. Energy-dispersive
spectroscopy was performed to analyze the elemental composition. The
selected-area diffraction pattern was also recorded for the h-NiNW
samples. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data was measured
with an X-ray photoemission spectrometer (Omicron Nanotechnology,
Taunusstein, Germany) with Al Kα operating at 1486.7 eV as the
X-ray source. Fityk software was utilized for the spectral background
(Shirely) deconvolution. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) of the synthesized
h-NiNW networks was performed using a Bruker Multimode AFM, Germany,
in the tapping mode, employing a silicon tip. The synthesized samples
were pelletized using a uniaxial press (Carver), and the dc conductivity
of the synthesized samples was measured by the four-probe method using
Keithley source meter 2182A and Aplab nanovoltmeter 9710P. Here, the
current probes were connected at the outer ends of the sample and
the voltage developed was measured using the inner probes connected
to a nanovoltmeter. The current was varied from 0.1 to 1 A. The resistivity
of the sample can be calculated using 13  where A is the cross-sectional
area of the sample in m2 and l is the
gap between voltage leads in m and hence the conductivity is found
to be 14  Thermal conductivity measurement was performed
using a physical property measurement system (PPMS DynaCool, Quantum
Design Inc., San Diego) with the help of thermal transport option
(TTO). Here, a heater shoe is used to supply heat to the sample, and
from sample geometry, thermal conductivity is measured. The Hall effect
of the synthesized sample was analyzed after pelletizing the powder
into a rectangular block (10 mm × 10 mm × 0.9 mm). The sample
was measured using the electrical transport option in PPMS. For this,
the sample was mounted in a 2.4 cm diameter puck connected by metal
wires and the alternating current (ac) transport (ACT) measurement
system was used for measuring the Hall voltage. The ACT option includes
a high precision current source and voltage detector configured with
a 9 T longitudinal magnet at 300 K. The magnetic properties of the
samples were measured using a vibrating sample magnetometer probe
in PPMS. The magnetic field was varied from −9 to +9 T at 300
K, and the magnetizations of the samples in both bulk and printed
forms were studied. M–T measurements
were carried out for a temperature range of 300–700 K at a
magnetic field of 200 Oe. The complex scattering parameters were measured
using a vector network analyzer (E5071C, ENA series, Agilent Technologies,
Santa Clara) operating at 300 kHz to 20 GHz. The transmission waveguide
technique was used to measure the electromagnetic scattering parameters
of h-NiNWs in the Ku band (12.4–8 GHz). For this, the h-NiNWs
were compacted and machined to the dimensions 15.8 mm × 7.90
mm to suitably fit in the waveguide. The electromagnetic waves when
reach the sample under test, they are either reflected, absorbed,
or transmitted. The microwave shielding effectiveness by reflection
(SER) and by absorption (SEA) can be calculated
using the equations72 15   16  The total shielding
effectiveness SET can be represented as the sum of reflection
shielding effectiveness
and absorption shielding effectiveness. 17  The viscosity of the screen-printed ink was
obtained using a modular compact rheometer (MCR 102, Anton Paar, Ashland,
VA) employing the cone and plate method (with cone diameter 24.98
mm and cone angle 2.009°). The viscosity measurements were carried
out for shear rates from 0 to 100 s–1 at 25 °C.
