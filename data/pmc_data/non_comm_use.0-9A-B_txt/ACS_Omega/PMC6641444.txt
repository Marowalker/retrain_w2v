Superwettable (by water or oil) materials
have been used in oil/water
separation to cope with the growing oily industrial sewage discharge
and oil spill accidents. The artificial superwetting materials for
oil/water separation that have been previously reported are expensive,
and using them usually causes secondary pollution, so practical, large-scale
uses of those materials are limited. Here, we find that wood sheet
shows underwater superoleophobicity and low oil adhesion in water,
resulting from its strong capacity of absorbing water. A through-microhole
array was created on the wood sheet surface by a simple mechanical
drilling process. The prewetted porous sheet had great ability to
separate the mixtures of water and oil with high separation efficiency.
Wood is a low cost, green, and natural eco-friendly material; therefore,
we believe that such a simple, low-cost, efficient, and green route
of large-scale oil/water separation has great potential to practically
solve the pollution problems caused by oil spill and oily industrial
wastewater.

1 Introduction
Oil
spill accidents occur frequently, and the amount of industrial
oily sewage is increasing year by year.1−4 Those accidents result in not only huge
economic losses but also serious environment pollution.5,6 To address the abovementioned problems, developing effective oil/water
separating technologies and materials is the critical path and is
emerging as a hot research field nowadays.2−4 Recently, microporous
materials with special wettability (i.e., superhydrophobicity or superoleophobicity)
have been successfully applied in oil/water separation devices.2,3,7−10 In 2004, Feng et al. prepared
a rough polytetrafluoroethylene-coated metal mesh which showed both
superhydrophobicity and superoleophilicity in air and used it to separate
the mixture of water and oil.11 Superhydrophobicity
resulted in water staying on the mesh, whereas superoleophilicity
allowed oil to fully wet and quickly penetrate through such a mesh,
achieving the separating function.12−17 However, this kind of “oil removing” material can
be easily contaminated and blocked by oil adhesion, resulting in an
apparent decline of separation efficiency.18−22 But since then, the research on wettability-dependent
oil/water separation still developed very slowly. Until 2011, Xue
et al. successfully separated an oil/water mixture by using a nanostructured
hydrogel-coated stainless steel mesh.18 The mesh was superhydrophilic in air but became superoleophobic
after immersing in water. The underwater superoleophobicity prevented
the oil from really touching the mesh surface; therefore, the rough
mesh could not be blocked even though the separation process was repeated
many times. Such “water removing” materials which can
remove water from the mixture have a better application prospect in
oil/water separation.2 Following this strategy,
various mesh or porous films with underwater superoleophobicity were
developed and applied in oil/water separation.23−32 For example, Zhang et al. prepared a superhydrophilic and underwater
ultralow oil-adhesive superoleophobic Cu(OH)2 nanorods-structured
copper mesh by a chemical-based oxidation method.23 Such an all-inorganic membrane could effectively separate
the mixtures of immiscible water and oil, as well as the oil-in-water
emulsions. Wen et al. successfully achieved oil/water separation by
using a zeolite-coated mesh.24 The zeolite
coating had characteristic pores and endowed the coated mesh with
superhydrophilicity and underwater superoleophobicity. Sun et al.
coated a layer of graphene oxide (GO) on commercial wire meshes.33 After plasma treatment, it was demonstrated
that the GO-coated meshes were superoleophobic in water and could
separate the mixture of bean oil and water. Gao et al. fabricated
an underwater superoleophobic porous nitrocellulose film with micro/nano
dual-scaled pores.19 The dual-scaled porosity
allowed the film to rapidly separate water from various oil/water
mixtures with a separation efficiency of above 99%. Tao et al. prepared
a superamphiphilic poly(vinylidene fluoride) membrane that showed
superoleophobicity in water and superhydrophobicity in oil.25 Such a membrane exhibited remarkable separation
efficiency, permeability, recyclability, and fouling resistance in
dealing with both oil-in-water and water-in-oil emulsions. Sometimes,
the oil in the mixture is heavy oil whose density is higher than that
of water, and a horizontal “water removing” membrane
cannot easily separate such a mixture by gravity. Alternatively, a
vertical underwater superoleophobic membrane or a Janus porous membrane
with distinct wettability is usually used to remove water from the
mixture of water and heavy oils. Zhang et al. fabricated a Janus mesh
that shows superhydrophobicity and superoleophilicity on one side
and shows superhydrophilicity and underwater superoleophobicity on
the other side by laser ablating the mesh followed by selective modification
with fluorosilane and GO, respectively.34 This Janus mesh can separate the mixture of water with not only
light oil but also heavy oil. The abovementioned underwater superoleophobic
materials have been proven effective in separating the mixture of
water and oil, but some inherent disadvantages restrict those separating
technologies to just the laboratory. First and foremost, the cost
of the adopted materials, the expensive equipment, and the human labor
for constructuring rough microstructures become a tremendous burden
for large-scale applications. Another problem is secondary pollution.
The most widely used metal meshes and porous polymers need to be treated
by chemical corrosion or other chemical treatments to form underwater
superoleophobic rough microstructures. The waste produced to prepare
the separating materials will bring a new environmental problem, although
the oil pollution problem is solved. Therefore, taking into account
the large-scale practical application, a simple, low-cost, eco-friendly,
green route that can efficiently separate large amounts of the mixtures
of water and oil is highly desired.

Here, we presented that
wood sheet has strong water-absorbing ability
and retention of water, endowing wood sheet with superoleophobicity
and very low oil adhesion in water. After generating a through-microhole
array by a simple drilling process, the resultant underwater superoleophobic
thin wood sheet was successfully applied in oil/water separation with
excellent separating ability. The good separation effect allows this
low-cost, large-scale, and green strategy for oil/water separation
to have great potential for practical application.

2 Results and Discussion
The underwater superoleophobic phenomenon
was first observed from
fish scales by Jiang’s group.33,35 Carp (inset
of Figure 1a) has tenacious
survival capability even in an adverse natural environment. Its skin
is fully covered by fan-shaped scales which are composed of hydrophilic
calcium phosphate skeleton and protein and a thin layer of mucus.
The scale surface is not smooth but shows a kind of a micro-/nanoscale
hierarchical structure. There are many micropapillae with the size
of several hundred micrometers fanning out on the scale surface (Figure 1a,b). The size of
the micropapillae decreases from the central area to the edge of the
scales. The top and the side wall of every micropapilla are further
decorated with abundant nanoscale “small pimples” (Figure 1c). Underwater superoleophobicity
is presented by fish scales. In water, when an oil (1,2-dichloroethane)
droplet is put on a scale surface, the oil droplet will keep as a
ball shape with an oil contact angle (OCA) of 151.5° ± 2°
(inset of Figure 1c). Figure 1d–f shows
the result of dripping an oil droplet onto the skin of a horizontal
carp. The oil droplet can easily roll away without leaving any stain
on the fish skin (Movie S1, Supporting Information). Such excellent antioil ability allows fish to maintain its very
high swimming speed in turbid or even oil-polluted waters. If some
scales peeled from a fresh fish are exposed to the air, they will
curl after being dried, demonstrating that fresh fish scales are high
in water content. It is the high water content (16.4–17.8%)
as well as the inherent hydrophilicity that results in underwater
superoleophobicity of fish scales and further endows fish skin with
an oil-repellent function.

Wood coming from trees is a low-cost, green, and natural
eco-friendly
material. Balsa, as a kind of natural wood, can be purchased directly
from the market or through internet shopping and is very cheap. Its
density is very low because of its rich porous inner structure but
its strength is quite high; therefore, it is widely applied in aviation,
shipping, transportation, building, wind energy, tables, chairs, and
so on. It is well-known that wood is one of the superabsorbent materials.
A 1.005 g dry wooden block (44 × 37 × 5 mm3)
will become 2.021 g if it fully absorbs water (Figure S1, Supporting Information). The absorbed water (1.016
g) has almost the same weight as the dry wooden block. The water content
of the wetted balsa wood in water can be estimated at about 50.3%;
this value is much greater than that of fresh fish scales. The high
water content of wetted balsa wood reveals that it may be underwater
superoleophobic and could possibly be used to separate water/oil mixtures.
There are abundant micropipes in the tree trunk, allowing water to
flow from the base to the top of the tree. When the tree was sawn
into sheets, those micropipes would break, resulting in many microgrooves
on the surface of the wood sheets. Figure 2a–c shows the SEM images of the surface
of a wood sheet. The surface is fully covered by ordered microgrooves.
The grooves are about several tens microns in width. The wall of the
grooves is not smooth. It was found that a very large number of protrusions
with a size of several hundred nanometers are randomly distributed
on the wall of the microgrooves (Figure 2c). When a water droplet was dripped onto
the wood surface, the droplet would spread out quickly and be absorbed
by the wood sheet (Figure 2d and Movie S2 in the Supporting Information). The water contact angle was close to zero, revealing inherent
superhydrophilicity of the wood surface. It has been demonstrated
that most in-air superhydrophilic materials will show superoleophobicity
in water.19,23,35−41 When the wood sheet was immersed in water and some oil droplets
(1,2-dichloroethane) were placed on its surface, the oil droplets
maintained a spherical shape rather than spreading out (inset of the Figure 2a). The OCA was as
high as 162.5° ± 2°, so the wood sheet exhibited underwater
superoleophobicity. If the surface was tilted more than 6.5°,
the underwater oil droplet would roll off the wood surface easily
(Figure 2e and Movie
S3 in the Supporting Information). Such
a low oil sliding angle (OSA) value (6.5°) indicated a very small
adhesive force between the underwater wood surface and the oil droplet.
The adhesive force was measured to be only 3.7 μN.

In addition to 1,2-dichloroethane, the wood sheet also showed
underwater
superoleophobicity and very low oil adhesion to a wide range of other
oils, regardless of whether they were heavy oils or light oils. Figure 3 depicts the static
shapes and dynamic rolling snapshots of some common oils droplets
on the wood sheet in water. The measured OCAs and OSAs are 151.5°
and 6° for hexadecane, 161.5° and 8.5° for dodecane,
152° and 8° for decane, 153.5° and 7° for petroleum
ether, 150.5° and 4° for paraffin liquid, 151.5° and
5° for sesame oil, 153.5° and 5.5° for kerosene, and
154.5° and 3.5° for crude oil, respectively. Surface wettability
is mainly governed by the surface chemistry and microstructures.42−47 As soon as the wood sheet was immersed in water, the wood would
absorb water quickly, and water would fully wet the surface microstructures
(Figure S2a,b, Supporting Information).
A thin water layer was trapped in the microstructures. When an oil
droplet was put on the wood sheet immersed in water, the trapped water
like a water cushion would prevent the oil droplet from contacting
with the wood substrate effectively because the polar water molecule
generally repels the nonpolar oil molecules.24 In fact, the oil droplet could only touch the tips of the rough
microstructures, which was at the underwater Cassie wetting state,
as shown in Figure S2c (Supporting Information).1,35,38 The contact
area between the wood substrate and the oil droplet is so small that
the wood sheet is endowed with underwater superoleophobicity and low
oil adhesion.

Figure 3 Static shape and the dynamic rolling behavior of different
oil
droplets on a wood sheet in a water medium.

A through-microhole array with a period of 1 mm was easily
formed
on a wood sheet (thickness of 1 mm) by a mechanical drilling process,
as shown in Figure 4a,b. These microholes with the diameter of ∼340 μm go
right through the sheet. The diameter of the through microholes is
larger than that of the used drill bit (300 μm) because of the
drilling-process-induced extrusion and stretch effects. The rest area
maintains its inherent micro-/nanoscale hierarchical structures except
for the microholes (Figure 4b). When the microholes-through wood sheet (MHWS) was immersed
in water, the wood sheet would absorb a large amount of water. Although
the diameter of the microholes would decrease slightly as well, the
drill-induced microholes were still open after some time. This could
be observed by an optical microscope. As shown in Figure 4a, the microhole region showed
white color because the backlight generated from the optical microscope
could pass through the microholes. In contrast, the backlight was
blocked by the rest region and such a region looked very dark. If
a water droplet was dripped onto the MHWS, the water would spread
out quickly within only 0.02 s because of the strong superhydrophilicity
of wood (Figure 4c).
With more and more water droplets being dripped onto the resultant
surface, the water penetrated through the sheet and dripped down because
there are a lot of perforated micropores distributing on the wood
sheet (Figure 4c,d,
Movie S4 in the Supporting Information).
The MHWS still had superoleophobicity and low oil adhesion with an
OCA of 155.5° ± 2° (Figure 4e) and an OSA of 7° ± 2° (Figure 4f, Movie S5 in the Supporting Information) in a water medium. In
this case, water was trapped in not only the surface microstructures
but also the through microholes. The underwater oil droplet on the
MHWS surface was also at the underwater Cassie state, as shown in Figure 4g.

Taking advantage of the in-air superhydrophilicity and in-water
superoleophobicity of the MHWS, a simple oil/water separating device
was designed, as shown in Figure 5a. The MHWS was used as the separating membrane and
was sandwiched between two glass tubes. A small amount of water was
first poured into the separating device to prewet the wood sheet (Figure 5b). Then, the oil/water
separation would start. When the mixture of oil (petroleum ether,
red color, dyed with oil red O) and water was poured into this device
(Figure 5c), it was
observed clearly that only water quickly passed through the MHWS and
dripped into the beaker below, whereas oil was stopped by the prewetted
wood and stayed in the upper tube (Figure 5d, Movie S6, Supporting Information). The separation process was just driven by the
gravity. As a result, the mixture was divided into two parts: separated
oil and separated water. Such a separating process could be finished
in a very short time, and the separated oil and water can be used
in our daily life again. The great separating ability of the MHWS
is mainly the result of its remarkable water absorption and underwater
superoleophobicity. The superhydrophilicity allows water to wet and
pass through the microholes quickly and endows the prewetted wood
with underwater superoleophobicity as well, whereas the underwater
superoleophobicity prevents oil from touching and wetting the prewetted
wood sheet surface. It is worth nothing that prewetting is a critical
step to successfully separate the mixtures of water and oil. If the
mixture was directly poured onto a dry MHWS, oil would also pass through
the sheet with water.

color) and
water by the MHWS. (a–d) A whole cycle of oil/water separation:
(a) before, (b) prewetting the wood sheet with water, (c) pouring
the oil/water mixture into the upper tube, (d) after separation, and
(e–h) restarting the separation process by adding new water
into the device.

Most traditional materials
for separating oil and water are disposable.2,3 Those
materials have many limitations for practically solving pollution
problems such as oil spills and oily industrial wastewater. As far
as our designed device, it stopped and quieted down at last after
finishing a cycle of oil/water separation. Interestingly, when we
further poured some water into the upper tube, the separation process
would be reactivated (Figure 5e–h, Movie S7 in the Supporting Information). The new added water passed through the MHWS again,
and the oil remained in the upper tube all the time, demonstrating
that the separation process could be restarted instantly as soon as
a new mixture was “fed”. After 10 cycles of separation,
the wood sheet still retained its color without any part being stained
by red oil which was predyed by oil red O (Figure S3, Supporting Information). This result reveals
that the MHWS was not contaminated by oil during the whole separation
process because the oil was repelled by the trapped water cushion
in the microstructures of the wood sheet surface and could not effectively
come in contact with the wood surface. So, the separation process
can be cycled a large number of times, and the separation device can
work continuously. In addition, the separation efficiency of the prewetted
MHWS was investigated by an optical microscope, as shown in Figure
S4 (Supporting Information). The result
indicates that the prewetted MHWS showed very high separation efficiency
for the mixture of oil and water.

The period of the microhole
array can be easily controlled by a
computer program during the drilling process, which has a major impact
on the separating flux and intrusion pressure of the designed separation
system. The water fluxes of the MHWSs with different periods were
assessed by measuring the time of a water column with the height of
15 cm passing through the resultant sheets, as shown in Figure 6. With increasing the period,
the water flux decreases quickly because the density of the microholes
that allow water to pass through reduces as well. The larger flux
value is obtained by the microhole-structured sheet with a smaller
period. For example, the water flux reaches up to 1.77 × 104 L m–2 h–1 when the period
is 1 mm (density of the microholes = 100 cm–2).
As another important performance of the separation device, the intrusion
pressure of oil was simply calculated by measuring the maximum supporting
height of the oil column. It can be seen from Figure 6 that the intrusion pressure changes little
as the period increases from 1 to 3.5 mm. The intrusion pressure is
almost a constant value in the range of experimental errors, regardless
of whether the microholes are close or not. In fact, the drilled microholes
worked independently and had no interference with each other, so the
intrusion pressure did not depend on the density as well as the period
of the microhole array. Such a result is very different from the rough
meshes and fabrics.24,27 The influence of the pore size
on the water flux, intrusion pressure, and separation efficiency was
also investigated. For comparison, a bigger drill bit with a diameter
of 500 μm was used to generate larger microscale through-holes
on a wood sheet. Figure S5 (Supporting Information) shows the variation of the flux and intrusion pressure with the
period for the larger-holes-structured wood sheet. A similar changing
trend with the abovementioned results can be obtained, but there are
some small differences. The flux values for the latter case are much
larger than that for the former case, whereas the intrusion pressure
values for the latter case are much less than those for the former
case. Such low intrusion pressure sometimes leads to a failed separation.
Therefore, using the drill bit with a diameter of 300 μm to
treat the wood sheet is optimal. In addition, we found that increasing
the thickness of the wood sheet is bad for achieving oil/water separation.
The through-microholes of the thicker wood sheet are more inclined
to be blocked after immersing in water because of the expansion of
the wood.

Figure 6 Variation of flux and intrusion pressure with the period of the
MHWS which was drilled with a thin drill bit 300 μm in diameter.

Dry wood is a well-known water-absorption
material. The wood mainly
consists of hydrophilic cellulose nanofibrils, lignin, and hemicelluloses.
Such a hydrophilic nature and an inherent porous inner structure endow
the wood surface with excellent underwater superoleophobicity. Because
the oil/water separating process is more involved in the underwater
superoleophobicity of the wood surface but nothing to do with the
wood species, we believe that most types of wood sheets can potentially
be used to separate the oil/water mixture after the generation of
through-microholes and prewetting treatment. For the practical application,
Balsa wood has many advantages such as low density and low cost. The
property of light wood enables the separating device to be easily
transported, and the low price can save cost for oil/water separation.
Wood is a natural material and can be directly biodegraded by microbes
in soil. The degradation of lignin is the critical process and step
of utilizing plant cellulose materials effectively. Once the MHWS
is damaged or contaminated after a long-term work, it will be easily
degraded and run off in soil by a biodegradable treatment. Therefore,
our fabricated MHWS is a green and eco-friendly separating membrane.
In addition, wood sheets generally have high structure strength, so
the separating devices with various shapes (such as wooden box, bucket,
basket, etc.) can be prepared. The prewetted microhole-structured
wooden box, bucket, and basket can be used to separate the mixture
of water and heavy oils. Such good strength also ensures the large-scale
oil/water separation by the MHWS.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, we found that the wood sheet shows underwater superoleophobicity
and ultralow oil adhesion to a wide range of oils, such as 1,2-dichloroethane,
hexadecane, dodecane, decane, petroleum ether, paraffin liquid, sesame
oil, kerosene, and crude oil. The measured OCA and OSA were 162.5°
± 2° and 6.5°, respectively, for a 1,2-dichloroethane
droplet on the wood sheet in a water medium. The underwater superoleophobicity
of the wood sheet was caused by its strong water absorbing ability.
After generating a through-microhole array on the wood sheet surface
by a simple mechanical drilling process, such a resultant sheet was
successfully applied to separate the mixture of water and oil and
showed excellent separating ability. This is a pure green separating
method: green materials, green fabrication, and green results. Wood
is a low-cost and very common material; therefore, we believe such
a simple, low-cost, efficient, and green route of large-scale oil/water
separation has great potential to practically solve the pollution
problems caused by oil spills and oily industrial wastewater.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
The
wood sheet with a thickness
of 1 mm that was used in this experiment is balsa, which was purchased
directly through internet shopping. Carp was bought from the market.

4.2 Generating Through-Microhole Arrays
A man-made
drilling mechanical system was used to generate microholes
that fully across from one side to another side of the wood sheet.
The wood sheet was fixed on a platform in advance. A mini drill was
used. The diameter of the drill bit was 0.3 mm. Then, the mobile platform
was controlled to move up and down and the drill bit was allowed to
pass through the wood sheet with the speed of 0.3 mm/s. A uniform
through-microhole array could be further fabricated by controlling
the drilling points.

4.3 Oil/Water Separation
The wood sheet
with a microhole array was applied as a separating membrane. It was
sandwiched between two glass tubes 30 mm in diameter. During a whole
separating process, the wood sheet was prewetted by a small amount
of water in advance, and then, the mixture of oil (petroleum ether)
and water (Voil/Vwater = 1:1) was quickly poured into the designed separating
device. To distinguish oil and water, the used oil was dyed by oil
red O and showed red color.

4.4 Characterization
The surface microstructures
of the wood sheet and the through-microhole-structured wood sheet
were observed by a scanning electron microscope (Quanta 250 FEG, FEI,
America). The wettability, including contact and sliding angles, was
investigated via a contact-angle system (JC2000D, Powereach, China).
Deionized water and petroleum ether were used as the main probe liquids.
The underwater oil wettabilities of hexadecane, dodecane, decane,
petroleum ether, paraffin liquid, sesame oil, kerosene, and crude
oil droplets were also tested. The adhesive force was measured by
a high-sensitivity micro-electromechanical balance system (DCAT 11,
DataPhysics, Germany).
