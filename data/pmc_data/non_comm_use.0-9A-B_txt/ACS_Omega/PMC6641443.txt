Developing
environment-friendly active and selective catalysts
for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane for on-purpose propene synthesis
is challenging despite tremendous industrial potential for this reaction.
Herein, we report on catalytic activity of high surface area hexagonal
boron nitride, toward oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. It shows
remarkable selectivity for alkenes (∼70%) at very high conversion
(of ∼50%) of propane. Propene and ethene selectivities as high
as 53 and 18%, respectively, were obtained at a conversion of 52%.
The catalytic activity is retained continuously for 5 h. Regeneration
in ammonia brings back the catalytic activity to its full potential.
Oxidation of surface B–N bonds in oxygen leads to the diminishing
catalytic activity after 5 h which, on heating in ammonia, reduced
back to their native form, regaining the indigenous activity. Remarkably,
the addition of ammonia in the reaction feed showed stable activity
for more than 100 h.

1 Introduction
Oxidative
dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane for its exothermic nature,
low operative temperature, and minimal coke deposition is a promising
alternative to the industrial dehydrogenation reaction which is endothermic
and plagued with rapid catalyst deactivation.1−3 However, the
ODH catalysts reported so far, mostly vanadium- and molybdenum-based
redox metal oxides, show very poor selectivity for propene at higher
propane conversion (>20%), where complete burning of hydrocarbons
predominates.3,4 The carbon nanotubes, which was
also used as a catalyst for the ODH reaction, showed about 70% propene
selectivity at about 5% conversion5 with
its inherent limitation to use it at higher temperature in the presence
of oxygen and hydrocarbons.6 Recently,
h-BN was reported to show unusual 79% selectivity for propene but
again only at a low propane conversion of 14%.7 Boron nitride (BN) for its high thermal stability and thermal conducting
property8,9 naturally is the best catalyst to carry
out the ODH reaction at higher temperatures. Nevertheless, the loss
of selectivity for olefins is a major impeding factor when it is sought
for high propane conversion. Herein, we report for the first time
a high surface area BN catalyst displaying remarkable selectivity
for olefins (∼70%) in ODH of propane even at high conversion
(52%) and at a high O2/propane ratio.

2 Results
and Discussion
High surface area BN was synthesized from
boric acid (BA) and dicyanamide
precursors using a reported method (see the experimental section).10 The white-colored BN powder obtained consists
of micron size particles which were porous (Supporting Information Figure S1a,b) in nature. The powder X-ray diffraction
(XRD) pattern (Supporting Information Figure
S1c) of the BN sample showed broad diffraction peaks corresponding
to (002) and (100) planes, which confirms the hexagonal structure
of the BN materials. The interplanar d-spacing value,
corresponding to the (002) plane, that is, 0.354 nm, was close to
that of the turbostatic BN (0.356 nm).11 The N2 adsorption–desorption measurement shows
the type IV isotherm (although the typical capillary uptake falls
in the low P/P0 region
with no hysteresis) along with the features for type I (Supporting Information Figure S1d) with a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) specific surface area (SSA) of 1380 m2/g.

The
catalytic activity of the BN material toward the propane ODH
reaction was tested by passing a mixture of propane, oxygen, and helium
(propane/O2 ratio 0.02) through a quartz reactor loaded
with the BN catalyst at different temperatures (390–570 °C)
and analyzing the products on an online gas chromatogram (GC) system
(experimental details, Supporting Information Figure S2). The low propane/O2 ratio of 0.02 was the
best optimized ratio to obtain high conversion with good selectivity
for olefins (Supporting Information Figure
S3), and it still falls within the safety regime.12Figure 1a shows that the BN catalyst started showing activity for propane
conversion beyond 400 °C, and the products observed in a significant
amount were propene, ethene, and carbon dioxide (Figure 1a). With increasing temperature,
the conversion increases sharply, and at 525 °C, it showed 52%
conversion (Figure 1a) with 53% selectivity for propene. Taking into account the formation
of 18% ethene, the total selectivity for olefins goes up to 70%. This
is indeed remarkable, considering the fact that no catalyst shows
such high selectivity for olefins at this high propane conversion.4,7,12−15Figure 1b compares the selectivity of propene with
propane conversion over different catalysts for the ODH reaction.
The carbon balance at 525 °C for this reaction was found to be
around 98.8 ± 0.8%. Control reactions with a blank reactor tube
and tube loaded with the packing material (quartz wool) showed conversions
less than 1% (Supporting Information Figure
S4), strongly supporting the catalytic role of BN in the ODH reaction
of propane.

Figure 1 Catalytic activity of BN materials. (a) Propane ODH reaction over
the BN catalyst. Reaction conditions: 0.1 g of catalyst, 20 mL min–1 total gas flow rate, and C3H8/O2/He = 1/50/49. (b) Propene selectivity vs propane conversion
plot for the propane ODH reaction, comparing the BN catalyst with
reported catalysts. Propane conversion (black squares), propene selectivity
(blue circles), ethene selectivity (wine red triangles), total olefin
selectivity i.e., summation of propene and ethene selectivities (green
spheres), and CO2 selectivity (dark yellow pentagons).
Open shapes in (b) indicate data from other works, which are cited
within the figure. Methane was formed only in trace amounts (less
than 1%) for the BN catalyst.

The yields of propene and total olefins (summation of propene
and
ethene) over the high surface area BN at 525 °C were around 28
and 38%, respectively, and a propene productivity of ∼0.625
kg per kg of the catalyst can be achieved in 10 h time. It is worth
noting that the maximum propene yield obtained in this study (around
28%) is comparable to the maximum yield achieved with the metal-based
catalysts (around 30%)3 and is significantly
higher than the maximum yield reported for metal-free nanocarbon catalysts
(around 17%).16 Further, as compared to
other metal-free catalysts such as carbon-based nanostructures, BN
materials have significant advantages in terms of their high thermal
conductivity and their excellent thermal stability at high temperature
(upto 800 °C, Supporting Information Figure S5) oxidizing environment.17,18

BN materials
synthesized using BA–urea19 and
BA–melamine20 as
precursors (Supporting Information Figures
S6, S7, and S8a) were also active toward the propane ODH reaction
(Supporting Information Figure S8b); however,
for a given propane conversion (∼50%), these samples showed
less selectivity for propene. The commercial bulk BN (Sigma-Aldrich,
measured BET SSA 48 m2/g) in our reaction conditions did
not show any significant propane conversion (<1%) up to 550 °C
(Supporting Information Figure S9).

Reactions carried out at higher residence time over BN catalysts
decrease the propene selectivity (Supporting Information Figure S10) because of combustion/cracking of propene/propane. When
extrapolated to zero residence time, the nonzero CO2 and
ethene selectivities (also <100% propene selectivity) suggest that
propane undergoes two parallel reactions, viz., combustion and cracking.
Separate experiments with a propene and oxygen mixture (in a ratio
of 1:50) over the BN catalyst under same conditions mainly give CO2 because of burning of propene and suggest that ethene could
be formed through cracking of propane. Thus, the propene selectivity
is limited by parallel (cracking/combustion of propane) and sequential
(combustion of propene) reactions.

A time-on-stream (TOS) study
at 525 °C shows that the activity
of the BN catalyst was preserved up to 5 h (Figure 2a), beyond which the conversion gradually
decreases and reaches below 20% in 12 h time with concomitant increase
in propene selectivity up to 80%. The absence of any weight loss in
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Supporting Information Figure S12a) for the spent BN catalyst after the 24 h reaction (BN-24h)
in the region of 200–800 °C suggests that there is no
coke deposition which could deactivate the BN catalyst beyond 5 h.
The XRD pattern of the BN-24h sample shows a pure hexagonal phase
similar to that of the as-prepared BN sample (Supporting Information Figure S12b). The nitrogen adsorption–desorption
isotherm exhibits type I behavior with a BET surface area of 1368
m2/g (Supporting Information Figure S12c). The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image (Supporting Information Figure S12d) further confirms
that the BN-24h sample was highly porous. Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) spectroscopy spectra of BN-24h, however, show weak but significant
IR bands corresponding to N–B–O (850–1200 cm–1) and O–B–O (530–730 cm–1) stretching/bending modes (Figure 3a) which were absent in the as-prepared BN sample,
suggesting partial oxidation of B–N bonds. Further, the B 1s
core-level X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of BN-24h
exhibit major peaks at 192.0 and 193.8 eV, corresponding to BNxOy and B–O
species, respectively (Figure 3b). Besides, the peak intensity of BN3 species
(190.5 eV) has come down in BN-24h as compared to the BN material
(Figure 3b). The presence
of NBxOy (399.95
eV) and N–O (401.55 eV) peaks in the N 1s core-level spectra
of BN-24h further supports partial oxidation of B–N bonds,
leading to its catalytic deactivation with time. It is interesting
to note that heating the BN catalyst in oxygen flow for 12 h did not
show any IR bands corresponding to N–B–O and O–B–O
stretching/bending modes (Supporting Information Figure S13a), and the oxygen-treated sample exhibited similar catalytic
activity for the propane ODH reaction as that of the BN materials
(Supporting Information Figure S13b). This
is in accordance with the high stability of BN in an oxygen environment
(Supporting Information Figure S5) and
suggests that oxidation of the BN catalyst takes place only when propane
is present in the reaction feed.

Figure 3 Spectroscopic characterization
of BN, BN-24h, and BN (R). (a) FTIR
spectra. (b) B 1s and N 1s core-level XPS spectra. Characteristic
IR bands for BN are at around 1385 and 800 cm–1 because
of B–N stretching and bending modes, respectively, whereas
IR bands in the region of 850–1200 and 530–730 cm–1 are due to N–B–O and O–B–O
stretching/bending modes, respectively.

The BN-24h sample was regenerated by heating it in the ammonia
flow at 900 °C for 2 h. Interestingly, the regenerated BN sample,
BN (R), showed a similar catalytic behavior in terms of propane conversion
(Figure 2b), olefin
selectivity (Figure 2b), and catalyst stability (Figure 2c) as the original BN materials. This confirms the
complete regeneration of the catalyst. Catalyst deactivation and regeneration
was carried out for 10 cycles, and after every regeneration step,
total recovery of the catalytic performance of the BN material was
observed (Figure 2d),
which indicates robustness of these materials in the reaction conditions.
The FTIR spectrum of BN (R) was very similar to that of the BN sample
without any N–B–O and O–B–O stretching/bending
modes (Figure 3a).
Also, the B 1s and N 1s core-level XPS spectra of BN (R) were similar
to those of BN, with major peaks corresponding to BN3 and
NB3 units and small shoulder peaks to BNxOy and NH species. Also, the B–N
ratio (calculated from an XPS survey scan) for BN-24h was 1.30 ±
0.06, which is nearly 30% higher as compared to that for BN (1.00
± 0.07) and BN (R) (1.0 ± 0.1), indicating that the loss
of nitrogen during oxidation of BN is getting regenerated to its original
form, hence regaining its activity fully. From these results, it is
evident that the surface B–N bonds are the active catalytic
sites for the propane ODH reaction. Indeed, when the ODH reaction
was carried out in the presence of ammonia (C3H8/O2/NH3 = 1:50:2.5; although the exact quantity
required for regeneration would be very low, as ammonia may get oxidized
in oxygen at elevated temperature21), the
BN catalyst showed stable activity even after 100 h of a continuous
reaction (Figure 4a)
with a propane conversion of >50% at 540 °C (Supporting Information Figure S14b). The propene and the total
olefin selectivities were >50 and >70%, respectively (Supporting Information Figure S14b). The IR spectra
of the spent catalyst (after 100 h) were similar to those of the fresh
BN sample and did not show any band corresponding to the oxidized
B–N species (Figure 4b). Clearly, in the presence of ammonia in the reaction feed,
the oxidized B–N bonds, during the propane ODH reaction, get
reduced back at the reaction temperature, resulting in no deactivation
of the catalyst.

propene selectivity (blue circles), ethene selectivity (wine red triangles),
and total olefin selectivity (green spheres). (b) FTIR spectra of
fresh BN and spent BN (after the TOS reaction in NH3 for

Although it is complex
to elucidate the exact mechanism, our spectroscopic
(IR and XPS) studies of BN, BN-24h, and BN-R strongly suggest that
surface B–N bonds are the active catalytic site and species
such as BNxOy, NBxOy,
N–O, and B–O (present on the surface of BN-24h) are
catalytically inactive. Clearly, nitrogen (a basic site) linked with
BN at the edge sites is an integral part of the active species, and
the reaction is probably initiated by hydrogen abstraction from propane.
This is evident from the fact that the deactivated catalyst regains
its activity when it is treated with ammonia and all the N–B–O
and O–B–O sites disappear as confirmed by the FTIR and
XPS studies. Furthermore, the catalyst does not lose its activity
when the reaction was carried out in the presence of ammonia. These
observations are in contrast with the previous reports (with the oxygen
to propane ratio <2 in the feed), where oxygen-rich species B–O–O–N7 and B–O–H22 were suggested to be the active sites. To understand the basis of
these differences, additional experimental and theoretical studies
are needed. Further, there could be various B–N species on
the BN surface (edge)23,24 such as B–N, N–B,
B–N–B, N–B–N, and B–NH2, and for precise understanding of the active sites, thorough in
situ catalyst characterization will be essential.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, we report here on the catalytic
behavior of high
surface area hexagonal BN for the propane ODH reaction. High propene
selectivity and yield obtained for the BN catalyst were comparable
or even better relative to those of the reported catalysts. The catalytic
activity was observed to be stable for nearly 5 h after which it decreases;
however, it could be completely regained by regenerating the catalyst
in the ammonia flow at elevated temperature. Oxidation of the dangling
B–N bonds at the edges and in the pores was found to be responsible
for the diminished catalytic activity, which reduced back to its original
form on heating in the ammonia flow. This suggested that the surface
B–N bonds could be the active catalytic centers for the propane
ODH reaction; however, a detailed in situ characterization and mechanistic
study is needed to understand the reaction mechanism. Further, by
introducing ammonia in the reaction feed, the BN samples showed remarkable
TOS stability for over 100 h. Currently, most (>85%) of the propene
is produced as a byproduct of the ethene industry which uses heavier
feedstocks such as naphtha.2 However, the
advent of shale gas (methane, ethane, propane, and butane) will be
driving the ethene industry away from heavier feedstock toward low-cost
ethane feedstock.25 Thus, in future, on-purpose
propene production from propane, which presently accounts for around
14% of the total propene production, would be heavily burdened and
will become highly competitive.2,25,26 In this backdrop, porous BN materials appear to be a very promising
catalyst for the propane ODH reaction.

4 Materials
and Methods
4.1 Materials
BA (H3BO3) and dicyanamide (C2H4N4) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Propane (2.0%, He balance),
propene (2.0%, He balance), ethene (2.0%, He balance), oxygen (99.99%),
helium (99.99%), ammonia (99.99 and 5.0% in He), and carbon dioxide
(10.1%, He balance) gases were purchased from Chemix, India. All the
chemicals and gases were used as received from the company. Water
and methanol were used as solvents wherever required.

4.2 Synthesis of BN
BA (2.74 g) and 10.1
g of dicyandiamide were dissolved in 100 mL hot water (∼85
°C) (Supporting Information Figure
S15). Solution was stirred at 85 °C till the solvent evaporated
completely. The resulting powder was thoroughly grinded (using a mortar–pestle)
and heated in a tubular furnace (Elite Thermal Systems Limited, TSH15/50/180-2416CG) at 1000 °C for 3 h in the ammonia flow (∼20
mL min–1) (Supporting Information Figure S15). The rate of heating and cooling was maintained at 10
°C/min. A white BN powder obtained was characterized.

4.3 Characterization
Morphologies of
the samples were analyzed by field emission scanning electron microscopy
(FEI NovaNano SEM-600, Netherlands). TEM images were acquired with
a JEOL JEM 3010 instrument (Japan) operated with an accelerating voltage
of 300 kV. Powder XRD patterns were acquired at room temperature with
a Bruker-D8 diffractometer employing Cu Kα. FTIR spectra were
acquired on a Bruker IFS 66v/S instrument in the range of 4000–400
cm–1. The XPS measurements were carried out with
an Omicron spectrometer using Al Kα as the X-ray source (1486.6
eV). On a copper tape, a thin film of BN was drop-casted, and over
this film, a carbon tape was stuck. The XPS spectra were acquired
close to the carbon tape. The peak positions and the binding energy
shift were interpreted mainly by referring to The Handbook of X-ray
Photoelectron Spectroscopy27 also to some
of the literature.28−30 The binding energy scale was calibrated using the
carbon 1s peak at 284.5 eV. The SSA of the samples was measured using
N2 sorption analysis at 77 K on Autosorb iQ2. BN samples were outgassed at 150 °C under vacuum for 24 h
before the N2 sorption study. TGA was carried out on PerkinElmer
Pyris 1 TGA under an oxygen flow of 20 mL min–1.
The heating rate was kept at 5 °C/min.

4.4 Catalyst
Testing
Catalytic activity
for the propane ODH reaction was tested by fixing 100 mg of the catalyst
at the center of a quartz tube reactor (40 cm length and 9 mm inner
diameter) with the help of quartz wool on both sides (Supporting Information Figure S2a). A mixture
of 10 mL min–1 2% propane in He and 10 mL min–1 oxygen (99.99%) (C3H8/O2 = 1:50, total flow rate = 20 mL min–1)
was passed through the reactor tube at 1 atm using mass flow controllers
(MFC, MKS Systems Singapore) (Supporting Information, Figure S2b). Reactor temperature was controlled by heating it inside
a tubular furnace (Carbolite, MTF 12/38/250). The products were analyzed
using online GC (Agilent 6890N and 7890A) systems fitted with alumina
(Rt-Alumina BOND/Na2SO4, 30 m × 0.32 mm
× 5 μm), monolithic carbon (Agilent GS-CarbonPLOT 30 m
× 0.32 mm I.D. × 3.0 μm), and molecular sieve (HP
MoleSieve, 30 m × 0.32 mm × 12 μm) columns. The propane
conversion and product selectivities were calculated according to
the equations given below.31
