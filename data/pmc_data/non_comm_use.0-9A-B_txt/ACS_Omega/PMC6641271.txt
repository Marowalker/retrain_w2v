The
extremely high adsorption efficiency of malachite green (MG)
was examined through a series of batch experiments by using Fe3+-doped Mg/Al layered double hydroxides (LDHs). The incorporation
of iron into Mg/Al LDH with varying Al + Fe molar ratio of 4 + 1,
3 + 2, 2 + 3, and 1 + 4 increased the adsorption capacity with respect
to time. The spectral analysis and N2 sorption studies
showed that there was retention of surface morphology in all of the
iron-modified LDH samples. The experimental evidences showed that
the adsorbent Mg/(Al + Fe) with a molar ratio of 10:2 + 3 had a significant
removal, i.e., 99.94% for MG with the initial concentration of 1000
mg L–1 at pH ∼ 9 and at room temperature
in 5 min. With further increase in iron loading (at ratio 10:1 + 4),
there was a decrease in the removal of MG due to the agglomeration
of Fe2O3 on the surface. The adsorption process
was best fitted to the Freundlich isotherm followed by the pseudo-second-order
model. The standard thermodynamic parameters (ΔH°, ΔS°, and ΔG°) were obtained over the temperature range of 20–50
°C. It was observed that the adsorption of MG onto Mg/(Al + Fe)
LDH was spontaneous, exothermic, and enthalpy driven in the physisorption
mode. A worthy desorption efficiency was achieved by using ethanol
and water, which was more than 90% in the three cycles. Maintaining
almost the same removal efficiency of MG even after three cycles indicated
Mg/(Al + Fe) LDH as a promising material for wastewater treatment.
This work was anticipated to open up new possibilities in dealing
with anionic dye pollutants.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The scarcity of safe drinking
water throughout the world has become
a grave concern and requires innovative and smart materials to remove
toxins from wastewater. The ubiquitousness of dyes in the effluents
of textile, paper, plastics, paints, and cosmetics companies are toxic,
carcinogenic, and mutagenic to cause serious health hazards and possess
threat to aquatic living organisms.1 Malachite
green (MG) has become a provocative dye, as it is extensively used
in aquaculture, fabrication of leather, silk, and paper, and simultaneously
branded as a class II toxic substance.2,3 The removal
of harmful dyes has been carried out by various conventional methods,
like membrane filtration, photocatalytic degradation, microbiological
process, coagulation, flocculation, and adsorption. Among these treatment
technologies, adsorption has attracted significant attention for the
removal of pollutants from aqueous solutions, owing to its advantages
of being technically simple, inexpensive, and noncumbersome, and having
sludge-free operational properties and excellent regeneration potential.4 Lately, activated carbon, graphene oxide, and
porous carbon materials have exhibited high efficacy as a sorbent
for dye removal, but the toxic effect of these nanosorbents are of
greater concern.5−7 Hitherto, it remains a challenge for researchers
to develop a simple, nontoxic, and efficient adsorbent for practical
applications to remove dyes from water.

Layered double hydroxides
(LDHs) belong to the family of two-dimensional
anionic clays with the general formula [MII1–xMIIIx(OH)2]x+[An–]x/n·yH2O, where MII represents a divalent metal
cation, MIII is a trivalent metal cation, An– is an interlayer anion, and x is defined as the molar ratio of MII/(MII +
MIII) metal ions.8 LDHs display
attractive physical and chemical properties including effectual dispersion,
large specific surface areas, and high anion exchange capacities that
make them ideal adsorbents for many cations and anions.9 The multifaceted use of transition-metal-modified
LDH for environmental sustainability and energy production has been
reported by our team.10 Dodecylsulfate-modified
Mg/Al LDH was used to remove polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that
showed efficient adsorption of hydrocarbons which is fitted well to
Freundlich and C-type isotherms.11 The
solar light-induced photodegradation of organic pollutants, hydrogen
evolution by water splitting, phosphate adsorption, and organic transformation
reactions by transition-metal-incorporated LDH systems have been reported
by our group.12−18 The effective removal of arsenate and vanadate has been achieved
by using hydrotalcite formed via the co-precipitation method that
removed more than 95% of the toxic anions.19

Various ternary LDHs with combinations of diverse divalent
and
trivalent metal ions were also reported.20,21 The established works on ternary LDHs are limited to definite applications
as catalysts in organic transformations and fluorescence sensitivity.22,23

In this paper, we have reported the designing of a ternary
Mg/(Al
+ Fe) LDH and investigated the effect of substituting Fe3+ ions into the LDH structure. The main objective of our study is
to investigate the effective and fast removal of malachite green (MG)
dye by Mg/(Al + Fe) LDH from contaminated water. The adsorption properties
of the prepared ternary LDH was explored by studying the effect of
various operating parameters, like, pH, dye concentration, temperature,
and contact time, on the adsorption process. To know the nature of
adsorption, the thermodynamic parameters, like ΔH°, ΔS°, and ΔG°, were also evaluated.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
Mg(NO3)2·6H2O, Al(NO3)3·6H2O, Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, NaOH,
and Na2CO3 were purchased from Merck Chemical.
All of the reagents were of analytical grade and used with no further
purification. The cationic dye, malachite green (MG), having the chemical
formula C23H25N2Cl and molecular
weight 364.63 g mol–1, was provided from Loba chemie
and used as such. All of the required stock solutions of the chosen
concentration were prepared in double-distilled and deionized water.

2.2 Synthesis of Adsorbent
The ternary
(Mg/Al + Fe)CO3 layered double hydroxide was prepared by
the co-precipitation method maintaining a constant ratio of Mg/(Al
+ Fe) = 2:1. The Al3+/Fe3+ ratio is changed
in different molar ratios to prepare a series of ternary LDHs, so
that the Mg/(Al + Fe) ratios were 10:4 + 1 (LDH A), 10:3 + 2 (LDH
B), 10:2 + 3 (LDH C), and 10:1 + 4 (LDH D). The mixed-salt solutions
were added to the solution of NaOH + Na2CO3 (2
M) in a dropwise manner, maintaining the pH of 9.5. The obtained suspension
was stirred using a magnetic stirrer at 300 rpm for 6 h at room temperature,
then centrifuged, and washed thoroughly with deionized water to remove
excess salt. Finally, the samples were dried overnight at 80 °C
in a hot air oven.24

2.3 Batch Mode Studies
The adsorption
experiments were done using a batch equilibration technique to study
the effect of pH, contact time, and temperature on the sorption of
MG by Mg/Al + Fe LDH. Weighed 1 g of MG was dissolved in 1 L of deionized
water to obtain the stock MG solution. Various concentrations (100–2500
mg L–1) of MG solution were freshly prepared from
the stock solution.

To study the pH effect, 20 mL of 1000 mg
L–1 of MG solution was poured into 100 mL of Erlenmeyer
flasks with a stopper. The initial pH (4–9) of the MG solutions
was adjusted by adding 0.01–1.0 M HCl or NaOH. An amount of
20 mg of adsorbent was added into the test solution at room temperature.
For each experiment, the agitation time was fixed at 5 min. After
agitation, the solution was centrifuged and the MG concentration analyzed
in a JASCO 750 UV–vis spectrophotometer. The equilibrium adsorption
capacity and the MG removal efficiency of Mg/(Al + Fe) LDH was estimated
by using the mass balance eqs 1 and 2 1   2  where qe is the
adsorption capacity (mg g–1), Ce and C0 are the equilibrium
concentrations (mg L–1) of MG at time t and the initial concentration, respectively, and m and V are the mass (mg) of the adsorbent and the
volume (L) of solution, respectively.

The kinetic studies were
examined by taking 20 mg of each adsorbent
into 100 mL Erlenmeyer flasks, containing 20 mL of 1000 mg L–1 MG solution at pH 4, with a stopper and oscillating for varying
time period from 5 to 40 min in a thermostated water bath at room
temperature. The samples were centrifuged at specific time interval
and the concentration of MG was analyzed by a UV–vis spectrophotometer.
The obtained data were fitted to pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order,
Elovich kinetic models, and intraparticle diffusion as shown in Table 1.

The adsorption isotherms
were investigated by changing the initial
concentration of MG between 100 and 2500 mg L–1 at
constant pH of 4. An amount of 20 mg of each sorbent was mixed with
20 mL of adsorbate solution and oscillated on a thermostated shaking
water bath at temperatures 293, 303, 313, and 323 K for 5 min. The
experimental adsorption equilibrium data were studied by two-parameter
isotherms, such as Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, and Dubinin–Radushkevich
models, and three-parameter isotherms, such as Sips, Toth, Redlich–Peterson,
and Khan models. The equations of the models are shown in Table 2.30−37 The thermodynamic parameters, such as the change in enthalpy (ΔH°), change in entropy (ΔS°),
and change in free energy (ΔG°), were
estimated from the considered temperature. To confirm the MG loading
on the adsorbent, 50 mg of adsorbent was agitated in 50 mL of 1000
mg L–1 at pH 9 for 5 min in a thermostated water
bath. The MG-loaded adsorbent was collected and dried in the oven
for 8 h.

2.4 Zero
Point Charge (pHZPC)
If the pH was less than the
pHZPC value, there was the
donation of more protons and the development of a positive charge
on the surface of the adsorbent. Conversely, the surface became negatively
charged if the pH was more than pHZPC. The pHZPC of Mg/(Al + Fe) samples was determined by a batch mode study.38 Initially, 20 mg of Mg/(Al + Fe) (10:2 + 3)
LDH in 20 mL of 0.1 M NaCl solution was taken and the initial pH (pHi) of NaCl solution was adjusted within the pH ∼ 0.5–7.5
by the addition of 0.1 M HCl and 0.1 M NH4OH. The suspension
was equilibrated at 25 °C for 24 h by stirring, was centrifuged,
and the final pH value (pHf) was determined. The procedure
was repeated with 0.01 M NaCl solution. The pHZPC value
was calculated as 7.2 after calibration from a plot of pHi vs pHf values.

2.5 Physicochemical Characterization
The chemical composition of the prepared LDHs samples were obtained
by atomic adsorption spectroscopy, and the water content was calculated
using eq 3(39) 3  where ne is the
number of carbonate anions and nt is the
number of interlayer water molecules per solid formula. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface areas, average pore diameter, and pore volume of the
prepared LDH samples were determined by multipoint N2 adsorption–desorption
method at the liquid N2 temperature (77 K) by an ASAP 2020
(Micromeritis). The samples were degassed at 110 °C and 5 ×
10–4 Torr for 5 h to remove the physically adsorbed
moisture. The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed
on a Rigaku D/MAX III VC diffractometer. The Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) spectra of the samples were recorded on a Varian FTIR spectrophotometer
(FTS-800) at room temperature by taking KBr as the reference in the
range of 400–4000 cm–1. The adsorbate concentration
analysis was done by using a UV–vis spectrophotometer of the
V-750 JASCO model. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were
obtained on a Philips TECHNAI G2 operated at 200 kV, in which the
samples were prepared by dispersing the powdered samples in ethanol
by sonication for 15 min and then drop-drying on a copper grid coated
with carbon film.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Spectral Characterization
The N2 sorption
studies and the corresponding isotherms for the
LDH A, LDH B, LDH C, and LDH D are shown in Figure 1. The sorption represents the aggregation
of slitlike pores with platelike particles by following a type IV
isotherm with a H3 hysteresis loop (IUPAC). The BET surface area values
of the LDH A to LDH D are given in Table 3. As illustrated in Table 3, an increase in the molar content of iron
from LDH A to LDH D leads to an increase in the specific surface area
from 62 to 105 m2 g–1. The high surface
area in the case of LDH D may be due to the deposition of aggregated
amorphous Fe2O3 on the LDH surface. The increased
iron amount promotes the formation of more active sites on the surface,
favoring attractive sorption.24,40

The
X-ray diffraction patterns of the series of ternary Mg/Al +
Fe-CO3 LDH with different Al3+/Fe3+ molar ratios are shown in Figure 2. The presence of sharp and symmetric (003), (006),
(009), (110), and (113) planes suggests a layered structure and signifies
the hexagonal LDH in the 3R packing of octahedral symmetry.38 As the radius of Fe3+ is more than
that of Al3+, the array density of the atoms on the surface
sheet of Mg/Al + Fe-CO3 LDH is smaller than that of the
atoms at the surface of Mg/Al-CO3 LDH.41 Therefore, from LDH A to LDH D, the position of the (110)
crystal planes shifts to a lower 2θ angle, indicating an isomorphous
substitution of Al3+ by Fe 3+.42 Although Mg/Al + Fe LDH brucite layer is stable, the incorporation
of iron in the LDH crystal is restricted with increase in iron content.
After a particular iron concentration, the excess unsubstituted iron
is proposed to be present in the form of amorphous Fe2O3 in LDH D.24

The small irregular flakes like particles are shown in the image for
LDH A. The particle size decreases upon the incorporation of iron
into the brucite-like layers from LDH A to LDH D, from which we can
also predict the growth of the amorphous Fe2O3 phase.

3.2 Effect
of Fe3+ Substitution on
MG Removal
The removal efficiency of pure Mg/Al LDH (LDH
X) is compared by varying the Al/Fe molar content onto the MG dye.
As shown in Figure 4, the percentage of removal is increased with increasing order from
LDH X to LDH C. The uptake percentage of MG is calculated to be 67
to 92 as iron loading increases. The percentage of MG removal follows
the order LDH C > LDH B > LDH D > LDH A > LDH X. The highest
removal
efficiency is exhibited by LDH C (Al + Fe ratio 2:3), as the substitution
of Fe3+ with Al3+ is optimal in the Mg/Al +
Fe LDH sample. The enhanced activity of LDH C may be attributed to
the fact that the electropositive character of transition metal Fe
is more than that of Al and the incorporation of Fe in Mg/Al LDH creates
a more positive charge on the surface of the ternary LDH, thus favoring
adsorption. When the molar ratio of Al/Fe increases to 1:4, the agglomeration
of Fe2O3 on the surface reduces the competence
of dye adsorption (74%), as mentioned in XRD.43

capacity of the as-made and iron-substituted LDH with different
Al/Fe ratios on to MG (500 mg L–1) at pH 4 in 5
min.

3.3 Effect
of Initial pH
The adsorption
capacity and the removal of the dye from the aqueous solution are
greatly dependent on the pH of the solution, which affects the surface
charge of the adsorbent and the degree of ionization of the dye molecule.
At lower pH, the surface of the adsorbent gets protonated and attracts
the positively charged dye molecules to the surface. At a higher pH,
the surface groups get deprotonated and the adsorption proceeds through
electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged surface and
the positively charged dye cations. Moreover, at a lower pH, the H+ ions and positively charged dye molecules compete for appropriate
adsorption sites on the surface of the catalyst. However, at a higher
pH, the uptake of dye molecules increases.

The influence of
initial pH on the adsorption of MG is carried out at various pH values
by adjusting the pH to 3.9, 5.5, 7.57, and 9.5, as illustrated in Figure 5. It can be seen
that the removal is 99% for the pH value of 7.5 and above for LDH
C.44 At the pH value less than 7, the decrease
in the adsorption may be attributed to two factors. (1) As the pH
decreases, the number of positively charged adsorbents experience
a force of repulsion on the positive surface of the adsorbent having
the pHzpc value 7.2. The cationic dye encounters competition
with the protons and the adsorption of MG becomes restricted. (2)
At a higher pH, the excess OH– ions present in the
solution get attached to the positively charged Mg/Al + Fe LDH and
accumulate on the LDH surface to form a negative layer. As a result,
the positively charged cationic dye MG molecules get tightly bound
to the OH– ion of LDH by the electrostatic force
of attraction, as shown in Scheme 1. As the pKa value of MG
is 10.3, it exhibits excellent adsorption at a higher pH value.45

and LDH D
(condition: 20 mL of 1000 mg L–1 MG solution, 20
mg of adsorbent, 5 min).

Mg/Al
+ Fe LDH at pH > 7
3.4 Effect of Contact Time
For dye uptake,
the contact time plays an important role, as the adsorbate species
diffuse from bulk to active sites of the surface. To determine the
relationship between the MG removal and contact time, a series of
systematic experiments are performed taking 1000 mg/L−1 MG solution over a period of 40 min at pH 4. As displayed in Figure 6, it is observed
that the adsorption rate of MG is significantly more at the initial
stage due to the abundant availability of active sites. The MG molecules
easily gain accessibility to the sites and in the first 5 min, the
adsorption reaches (63.3%) the maximum for LDH C. Subsequently, the
steric hindrance caused by the bulky MG dye molecules on the surface
hinders the tempo of adsorption, reaching a state of equilibrium (95.32%)
after 20 min. Figure 4 demonstrates the highest uptake of MG by LDH C, which is 63.3% in
the first 5 min and 99.04% after 25 min. This is due to the high surface
area of LDH C.

A, LDH
B, LDH C and LDH D (condition: 20 mL of 1000 mg L–1 MG solution, pH 4, 20 mg of adsorbent).

As displayed in Figure 7, the absorbance of MG dye decreases with increase
in time
(for t values 0 and 20 min, A is
1.57 and 0.01, respectively), indicating an efficient removal of the
dye by ternary LDH C.

mg L–1 MG solution, pH 4, 20 mg of adsorbent).

3.5 Adsorption
Kinetics
To explain the
transport of MG on to Mg/Al + Fe LDH and to determine the rate of
adsorption and the dynamics involved during adsorption, the Lagergren
pseudo-first-order,25,26 pseudo-second-order,27 intraparticle diffusion model,28 and Elovich models29 are applied
to the experimental data from the effect of contact time for all of
the Mg/Al + Fe LDH samples. The nonlinear equations for these models
are given in Table 1. TThe kinetics parameters of all the models got from the adsorption
experimental data obtained for LDH A, LDH B, LDH C, and LDH D is represented
in Table 4. The reliance
of the model that best fits the experimental data is chosen based
on the lowest sum of squared residuals (SSR).46 It is observed that the obtained data best fit the pseudo-second-order
model. So, the adsorption of MG on LDH occurs through bimolecular
interactions involving the sharing or exchange of electron.

To further
describe the rate-limiting step, the intraparticle diffusion
model and the kinetics are studied. Generally, adsorption occurs through
four processes. (1) Adsorbates are transmitted from the bulk phase
onto the adsorbent surface. (2) The transport of incoming adsorbate
passes through the liquid film attached to the adsorbent surface (film
diffusion). (3) The adsorbate is passed within the pores of the adsorbent
(intraparticle diffusion). (4) There is an interaction between the
active site of the adsorbent and adsorbate.47 As the plot obtained from the qt versus t1/2 does not pass through the origin, it suggests
that the intraparticle diffusion partially controls the rate-limiting
step and the adsorption of MG proceeds by film diffusion process as
described above.48−50 The intraparticle diffusion constant (kid) is obtained from the plot and increases from LDH A
to LDH C and then further decreases for LDH D. The formation of Fe2O3 on the LDH surface may restrict the transportation
of MG to the external surface of the adsorbent. Therefore, a higher
adsorption capacity (qe) is obtained for
LDH C (Table 5).

3.6 Effect of Temperature
The solution
temperature greatly affects the removal efficiency of MG. This may
be due to the textural properties of the adsorbents, decrease in the
viscosity of the solution, and increase in the rate of diffusion of
the adsorbent.46,51,52 The effect of temperature is investigated over the temperature range
of 293–323 K for all of the adsorbents as shown in Figure 8. With an increase
in adsorbate temperature, the adsorption capacity (qe) is increased for all of the samples. In this case,
the high uptake of MG is due to the decrease in the viscosity of the
solution, faster mobility of MG toward the active sites, an increase
in the porosity and pore volumes of the adsorbent resulting in the
enhancement of active sites.46,51,52 That is why, the effective removal of MG is carried out.

Figure 8 Effect of temperature
on the MG adsorption on to (a) LDH A, (b)
LDH B, (c) LDH C, and (d) LDH D (condition: 20 mL of 100−2500
mg L–1 MG solution, pH = 4, 20 mg of adsorbent,
5 min).

3.7 Adsorption
Isotherm and Modeling
Adsorption isotherms usually play a
vital role in predicting the
mechanism of how the MG molecules interact with the active sites on
the adsorbent surface. The two-parameter isotherms, such as Langmuir,30 Freundlich,31 Temkin,32 and Dubinin–Radushkevich,33 and three-parameter isotherms, such as Sips,34 Khan,37 Redlich–Peterson,36 and Toth,35 are applied
to understand the fitted model. All of the nonlinear isotherms mentioned
above are given in Table 3. The experimental adsorption equilibrium data for the adsorbents
are calculated by the initial MG concentration over the temperature
range of 293–323 K. The acceptability of the models that best
fit the equilibrium data is considered from the lowest sum of the
squared residuals (SSR).46 The values of
different parameters obtained during MG adsorption for the fitted
model are presented in Table 5.

Table 5 shows that the Freundlich isotherm can only
best fit to the experimental data obtained for LDH A, LDH B, LDH C,
and LDH D, as shown in Figure 9. The curves for best-fit isotherm model for different adsorbent
are shown. The Freundlich isotherm model may assume the heterogeneity
of the adsorbent surface.53 Therefore,
MG adsorption onto LDH A, LDH B, LDH C, and LDH D might be assumed
to be a multilayered adsorption. From Table 5, it is observed that the KF value decreases with increase in temperature (in order
following LDH C > LDH B > LDH D > LDH A at temperature 293
K, 303
K, 313 K and 323 K). Hence, the highest KF value 21.43 is obtained for LDH C at 293 K. The Freundlich constant n values (1.59–2.21) are ≤10, indicating that
MG adsorption is favorable.46,53

Figure 9 Fitted Langmuir and Freundlich
isotherm at different temperatures
for (a) LDH A, (b) LDH B, (c) LDH C, and (d) LDH D (condition: 20
mL of 100−2500 mg L–1 MG solution, pH 4,
20 mg of adsorbent, 5 min).

The Langmuir maximum adsorption capacity (qm) is varied from 580.50 to 484.52 for LDH A, 997.50 to
820.65
for LDH B, 1072.82 to 1045.90 for LDH C, and 551.15 to 458.02 for
LDH D over the temperature range 293–323. This indicates the
decrease in qm value with increase in
temperature. The nature and shape of adsorption also depend on the
value of the separation factor (RL) as
expressed in eq 4(54) 4  where b is the Langmuir isotherm
constant obtained from Table 5. Ci is the initial MG concentration.
Adsorption is expected to be favorable if 0 <RL <1, unfavorable if RL > 1, irreversible if RL = 0, and
linear
if RL = 1. All of the RL values are calculated to lie in the range of 0 < RL < 1. Hence, it indicates a favorable adsorption
of MG dye on LDH adsorbent.46,54

The Langmuir
maximum adsorption capacity (qm = 1072.82
mg g–1) for MG is compared with
other reported values for different adsorbents. It is found superior
than other adsorbent in terms of MG removal. The result shows that
Mg/Al + Fe LDH is a super and smart adsorbent of MG (Table 6).

3.8 Thermodynamic Studies
The adsorption
process is accompanied by the thermodynamic parameters, such as change
in enthalpy (ΔH°), change in entropy (ΔS°), and change in Gibbs energy (ΔG°), as it is temperature dependent. To examine the feasibility
and spontaneity of the adsorption process, ΔG values are considered. If ΔG is negative,
the process is spontaneous. From the qe value obtained over the studied temperature, we can assume that
the reaction is either endothermic or exothermic. The adsorption process
is endothermic if the adsorption capacity (qeq) increases with increase in temperature, and the condition
is reversed for the exothermic process. The following parameters are
assessed from eqs 5, 6, and 7(61) 5   6   7  where Kc is the
thermodynamic equilibrium constant, Cad (mg L–1) is the equilibrium concentration of adsorbate
onto adsorbent surface, and Ce (mg L–1) is the equilibrium concentration in an aqueous solution.
ΔG° (kJ mol–1) is the
standard Gibbs energy change. T (K) is the temperature
in Kelvin, R is the gas constant (8.314 J (mol K)−1), ΔH° (kJ mol–1) is the enthalpy change, and ΔS° (J
(mol K)−1) is the entropy change. The values of
the change in enthalpy (ΔH°) and entropy
(ΔS°) are obtained from the slop and intercept
found from the plot of ln K against 1/T, respectively.

From Figure 10 and Table 7, we observe that the negative
values for ΔG° suggest that MG adsorption
on the adsorbents is a spontaneous and feasible process. Further,
it is noticed that there is a decrease in the negative value for ΔG°, which is obtained with the rise in temperature,
suggesting a better adsorption at a lower temperature. An exothermic
process of adsorption is confirmed from the negative ΔH° values; in addition, a decrease in the disorderness
at the solid–solution interface is predicted from a negative
ΔS° value. Hence, the adsorption of MG
on different LDH is typically an enthalpy-driven process. From the
value of heat of adsorption, the interaction between the adsorbent
and adsorbate can be determined. If the ΔH value
lies in the range 2.1–20.9 kJ mol–1, the
interaction is assumed to be physical (physisorption).62 However, it is termed chemisorption if ΔH lies between 80 and 200 kJ mol–1. Because
the ΔH values obtained lie within 20.9, the
process of removal of MG from the aqueous solution by using LDH A,
LDH B, LDH C, and LDH D is assumed to be physisorption (van der Waals
forces).63

MG removal by (a) LDH A, (b) LDH B, (c)
LDH C, and (d) LDH D.

of MG on LDH A, LDH B, LDH C, and LDH D

Thus, establishing
LDH C with an optimum iron content as a super
and smart adsorbent. To know the successful adsorption of MG on LDH
C, we carried out the XRD, FTIR and UV−vis spectra for LDH
C and MG-loaded LDH C.

4 Characterization of MG-Loaded
LDH
4.1 XRD Spectral Analysis
As shown in Figure 11, the XRD patterns
clearly indicate that the characteristic XRD peak of LDH C is maintained
even after the adsorption of malachite green. Reduction in the intensity
of LDH C after adsorption (MG-loaded LDH C) indicates a decrease in
the degree of crystallinity.

Figure 11 XRD spectra of LDH C and MG-loaded LDH C.

4.2 FTIR
Spectral Analysis
The FTIR spectra
of LDH C and malachite green-loaded LDH C can be used as an appropriate
technique for the survey of dye loading on Mg/Al + Fe LDH. As shown
in Figure 12, the
broad absorption band in the region of 3417 cm–1 is assigned to the O–H stretching vibrational mode of the
hydroxyl groups in the LDH and the interlayer water molecules.64 The medium band close to 1640 cm–1 is attributed to the bending vibration of the stretched water molecules.65 The bands at 1390 and 870 cm–1 are due to carbonate.66 The absorption
peak at 585 cm–1 confirms the formation of α-Fe2O3. This has been ascribed as after the complete
substitution of Fe3+ in the brucite layer of hydrotalcite
maintaining the stability of Fe-LDH by M2+/M3+ = 2, the excess unsubstituted Fe3+ has been present in
the form of Fe2O3.24 The finger print peak for MG between 1500 and 500 cm–1 supports the peak at 1590.77 cm–1, matching the
C=C stretching of benzene ring. The peak between 1200 and 1142
cm–1 is for the C–N stretching vibration
of the aromatic ring. The peak for −CH2 scissoring,
−CH3 asymmetric band, and −NH2 wag are observed at 1434, 1370, and 827 cm–1,
respectively.67 From the above observation,
it is concluded that MG is successfully adsorbed on LDH C.

of LDH C and MG-loaded LDH C.

4.3 UV–Vis Spectral Analysis
Figure 13 compares the UV–vis
diffusion reflectance spectra of LDH C before and after adsorption.
The strong adsorption band at 254 nm shows the presence of the Fe3+ species. The adsorption wavelength 621 nm confirms the adsorption
of malachite green on the LDH surface.

reflection spectra of LDH C and MG-loaded

5 Adsorption
Mechanism and Recycle Performance
The possible mechanism
for cationic MG dye adsorption by anionic
clay Mg/Al + Fe LDH based on the above observations may be described
as follows (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Plausible Mechanistic Pathways during the Adsorption of MG
on Ternary
Mg/Al + Fe LDH
Case 1: As MG is a
cationic aromatic azo dye, the delocalized “π”
electrons in the aromatic ring form a negative charge cloud. The negative
charge is attracted by the positively charge surface of Mg/Al + Fe
LDH through an electrostatic force of attraction.68

Case 2: Another reason for adsorption is the direct
interaction
between the positively charged azo group of MG with the negative interlayer
anions (CO3–2) group of the LDH.

As it is very important to study the stability and reusability
of an adsorbent to achieve economic viability and efficiency, the
same adsorbent is used for various runs. After three cycles of experiment,
it is found that the ternary LDH Mg/(Al + Fe) still removes more than
90% of the dye within a time span of 30 min, as shown in Figure 14. The adsorbed
dye is thoroughly washed with ethanol and deionized water, and the
adsorbent is dried under hot air oven at 100 °C for 6 h and subjected
to dye removal. The color and morphology undergo no change during
the cycle experiments, establishing the stability and efficiency of
the material for reuse.

cycles.

6 Conclusions
A ternary
layered double hydroxide doped with Fe3+ ions
in the octahedral sites of Mg/Al LDH brucite layer was prepared by
the co-precipitation method, and the adsorption of MG from the aqueous
solution was proficiently carried out on it. It was observed that
the adsorption capacity of the adsorbents significantly increased
from 580.50 to 1072.82 mg g–1 with increase in the
iron content for Al + Fe molar ratio 4 + 1 to 2 + 3 except for the
molar ratio 1 + 4, i.e., 551.15 mg g–1 in 5 min.
It was revealed that the incorporation of iron content on Mg/Al LDH
surface could enhance the surface area, but the adsorption capacity
was further decreased due to the agglomeration of Fe2O3 on the Mg/Al LDH surface. Hence, the highest adsorption capacity
was achieved with Mg/(Al + Fe) with the molar ratio 10:2 + 3. The
optimum removal of MG was noticed at pH 9, i.e., 99.94%, and the equilibrium
was attained after 25 min. The adsorption followed the pseudo-second-order
kinetics model specifying a bimolecular rate determination. From the
applied isotherm model, Langmuir and Freundlich model were fitted
well to the equilibrium data, but Freundlich model was best fitted,
indicating a multilayered adsorption of MG on a heterogeneous adsorbent
surface. The high adsorption capacity observed near ambient temperature
favors the treatment of effluents from several sources. The adsorption
onto all of the adsorbent was spontaneous, feasible enthalpy driven,
and exothermic in nature. The desorption experiment revealed that
the adsorbents were efficiently regenerated. Even after 3 cycles,
more than 90% of the MG can be removed. Thus, these adsorbents can
be used as potential sorbents for reuse and do not produce secondary
pollutant. Fast and efficient removal of malachite green by the MG/Al
+ Fe LDH may be due to the electrostatic interaction between (i) the
positive LDH surface and the delocalized π electrons in the
aromatic ring of azo dye and (ii) the cationic MG dye, OH– ion, and the CO32– group of the LDH.

The positive charge of LDH with a large surface area, abundant
active sites, and compatibility made the sorbent a champion in water
remediation. The present call for speed over quality and quantity
for pollution remediation is very much satisfied by the ternary LDH,
which can be used as a super and smart adsorbent in the future for
the removal of dyes from water.
