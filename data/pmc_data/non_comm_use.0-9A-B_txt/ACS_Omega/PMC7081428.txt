The reaction mechanism
involved in the decomposition of ammonium
nitrate (AN) in the presence of CaCO3 and CaSO4, commonly used for stabilization and the reduction of explosivity
properties of AN, was theoretically investigated using a computational
approach based on density functional theory. The presented computational
results suggest that both carbonate and sulfate anions can intercept
an acid proton from nitric acid issued from the first step of decomposition
of AN, thus inhibiting its runaway decomposition and the generation
of reactive species (radicals). The reaction then leads to the production
of stable products, as experimentally observed. Our modeling outcomes
allow for tracing a relationship between the capability of proton
acceptance of both carbonate and sulfate anions and the macroscopic
behavior of these two additives as inhibitor or inert in the AN mixture.

1 Introduction
Ammonium
nitrate (AN) is widely used in the industry. For instance,
it is a source of nitrogen in fertilizer formulations, and it is also
employed as a combustible in explosives because of its remarkable
oxidant properties. The safety knowledge about AN is essentially based
on the feedback coming from past accidents and experimental studies,
the latter being mainly calorimetric and kinetic studies.1−5 AN is described as presenting good chemical stability when it is
correctly manufactured, uncontaminated, and stored under adequate
conditions. Nevertheless, AN can undergo fast decomposition6−9 in certain situations (e.g., under confinement or in the presence
of contaminants), leading to major accidents during production and
storage.10,11

Because AN-based fertilizers always
contain additives for a variety
of reasons (e.g., efficient granulation or prilling, anticaking effect,
slow release of nutriment at end-use, etc...), it is important to
fully understand their influence on the thermal stability of the resulting
mixtures. Starting from calorimetric tests,12−16 previous works17−19 identified different behaviors
of additives on the thermal stability of AN formulations, leading
to three different classes: promoters, inert substances, and inhibitors.
A promoter (or incompatible) substance causes destabilization of AN,
and it is experimentally identified by a decrease of the decomposition
temperature of the mixture with respect to that of pure AN, often
associated with a higher energy release during the decomposition.17−19 Examples of promoters are fuels, halide salts, nitrates and sulfates
of chromium, iron, copper, and aluminum, and several organic compounds.20,21 An inert additive (apparently) does not affect the thermal stability
of AN because no significant temperature shift of the exothermal decomposition
is observed [e.g., for NaNO3, KNO3 and Ca(NO3)2].20,21 It generally acts through
a physical dilution effect, reducing the heat released during the
(possible) explosive decomposition of the formulation.20 An inhibitor has a stabilizing effect on AN,
leading to a higher decomposition temperature of the mixture and a
lower heat release during the reaction than those observed for neat
AN.17−21 Most of the salts of oxyanions (AxOyz–) such
as sulfates, carbonates, or phosphates of sodium, potassium, ammonium,
and calcium evidenced such behavior when investigated by differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC).20

For
instance, it is well known that calcium carbonate shows remarkable
inhibiting properties when mixed in limited quantities with AN, as
recently reported by Babrauskas in the case of AN-based fertilizer
formulations.11 Indeed, he showed that
the explosive power developed by a mixture of AN/calcium carbonate
(90/10) is only 10% of the reference (picric acid, a primary explosive),
whereas neat AN would achieve 80%. Accordingly, this inhibitor property
is extensively used by manufacturers to market the so-called CAN fertilizer
formulation (CAN stands for calcium ammonium nitrate), which is considered
significantly safer than conventional AN formulations containing up
to 33–34% nitrogen from AN (although not exempt of any explosion
hazard).

Even if calorimetric tests provide valuable information
on the
global effect of additives on the thermal stability of AN, they do
not allow a clear identification of the detailed reaction mechanism
involved in the AN decomposition. To (partially) fill this gap, a
molecular modeling approach was proposed to clarify the detailed reaction
mechanism of incompatible substances with AN.22−24 In particular,
this approach was successfully used to investigate the incompatibility
of sodium salt of dichloroisocyanuric acid.23 Whereas the proposed mechanism for the chemical incompatibility
of AN has been validated for other chemicals,24 still no evidence has been given on how other compatible (i.e.,
inhibitor and inert) compounds act on the AN decomposition.

Among the substance classified as inhibitors, calcium carbonate
(CaCO3) is widely used because it ensures excellent stabilization
capabilities20 and it can be obtained at
low cost from dolomite and limestone.25 Several experimental studies have been conducted, leading to the
proposition of the following reaction for the decomposition of AN
in the presence of CaCO325−30 1  

Experimental calorimetric
tests also demonstrated the inhibitor
behavior of this salt. Typical parameters to rationalize the behavior
of the mixture with respect to pure compound are the onset temperature
(Tonset), that is, the temperature at
which the calorimetric reaction starts, and the maximum temperature
(Tmax), corresponding to the maximum of
the peak of the calorimetric plot. For the decomposition of pure AN,
this last temperature is 263.0 °C with differential thermal analysis
experiments, whereas it ranges between 270.7 and 308.8 °C when
it is mixed with 5% wt of different types of dolomite and limestone.29 DSC experiments indicate that Tmax of decomposition of pure AN is 326 °C, a value
that increases to 360.0 °C, when mixed with 5% wt of pure CaCO3, and to 389.0 °C with 20%.29 The decomposition of pure AN generates a heat of 1255 J/g, but when
it is mixed with 33% wt of CaCO3, the heat generated decreases
to 397 J/g. The ensemble of these data clearly shows the inhibiting
behavior of calcium carbonate and its role as a robust stabilizer
of AN formulations.

Contrary to CaCO3, only limited
literature exists on
CaSO4, and it suggests a lower stabilizing effect on the
thermal stability of AN.20,21 Indeed, according to
DSC tests,20Tmax increases to 333.0 °C when AN is mixed with 5% wt of pure CaSO4, and with 20% wt of CaSO4, Tmax is 334 °C. Moreover, the heat generated by a mixture
of AN with 33% weight of CaSO4 is 669 J/g, about one-half
of AN decomposition heat.

Considering all these experimental
data, we have investigated,
using modern modeling techniques, the decomposition of AN in the presence
of CaCO3 and CaSO4 in order to shed light on
the underpinning molecular reaction mechanisms. In particular, our
work is aimed at identifying the role played by CaCO3 and
CaSO4 on the decomposition pathway of AN in reducing, or
even eliminating, the generation of highly reactive species (such
as radicals or energetic molecules). Furthermore, an effort was made
to define a relationship between the key reaction steps of the identified
reactions and the behavior, as inert or inhibitor, of CaCO3 and CaSO4 when added to the AN mixture.

2 Results and Discussion
Our previous study22 revealed that the
rate-determining step of AN decomposition requires a significant amount
of energy, and it leads to the production of a number of reactive
species. After the first step, where AN can easily dissociate (ΔG = 5.4 kcal/mol) into NH3 and HNO3 (eq 2), nitrogen dioxide
(NO2•) and hydroxyl (OH•) radicals are formed through
homolytic rupture of the NO bond (eq 3). 2   3  

This last reaction is the rate-limiting step
of AN decomposition,
and it requires a high amount of energy (ΔG = 40.2 kcal/mol),22 which explains the
stability of AN under normal conditions of storage. The whole decomposition
process is, however, strongly exothermic with the release of a high
amount of energy (ΔG = −165 kcal/mol).
The final products, in agreement with experimental observations, are
N2, H2O, O2, OH, HNO, and NO3.

In the following, we assume that reaction 2 has already taken place because it requires
a small amount of energy and, therefore, attention will be given to
the possible reactions of CaCO3 and CaSO4 with
HNO3 or NH3. We will then compare these reactions
with the decomposition of pure AN in order to identify the energetically
most favorable decomposition pathway and the related products.

It should be considered that all calculations presented in the
following were carried out in the gas phase, whereas the experimental
conditions could be affected by some factors such as atmosphere components
(including humidity), impurities, or aggregation state. These effects
require dedicated modeling approaches: for instance, amorphous inorganic
substances can be modelled using periodic boundary conditions for
ideal crystals (see for instance refs (31−34)) and the effect of the moisture can be simulated by the introduction
of a finite number of water molecules in the reaction mechanisms (as
in ref (23)). Exploring
all these effects is, therefore, not only complex from a computational
point of view (and out of the scope of the present paper) but also
requires a preliminary knowledge of the basic (unperturbed) reaction
mechanisms, whose identification is the aim of the present paper.
This is even more necessary when the reactions take place in “real
life” environments and all experimental conditions are difficult
to assess. Therefore, despite the model limitations, the theoretical
characterization of the gas-phase molecules and the reaction provides
valuable hints on the elementary chemical processes involving energetic
materials,22,23,35−37 especially when it can be related to experimental
evidences, such as the identified stable products.

2.1 Reaction
Mechanism between AN and CaCO3
The reaction between
AN and CaCO3 was
investigated by considering that CaCO3 can separately react
with nitric acid, here after referred to as path A, and ammonia, path
B. The whole reaction mechanism is reported in Scheme 1, and the corresponding energy profile is
in Figure 1. The computed
energies are also reported in Table 1.

and CaCO3.

[NH2···CaCO3H]	–17.7	–17.2	–18.3	
[NH2···CaCO3H···NH3]	–22.3	–22.5	–14.2	
As the first step of path A, a proton is transferred
from nitric
acid to CaCO3 through a barrier-less and exothermic reaction
to give the complex [NO3···CaCO3H] (ΔG = −67.1 kcal/mol, presented
in Figure S1). This complex is very stable,
and its decomposition requires a significant amount of energy (>150
kcal/mol as computed for the four dissociation reactions presented
in Figure S2). It can, however, react with
a second molecule of HNO3 to form a complex, [NO3···CaCO3H2···NO3] (Figure S3), where a second proton
moves from the acid to the basic carbonate. Even in this case, complexation
and protonation of carbonate are a concerted and exothermic reaction
(by −27.9 kcal/mol), showing no barrier. The complex [NO3···CaCO3H2···NO3] decomposes into Ca(NO3)2 and H2CO3 (ΔG = −76.9 kcal/mol)
with a barrier of 18.1 kcal/mol. Ca(NO3)2 is
one of the reaction products found in experiments.20−25 Other decomposition reactions are possible, but they are all higher
in energy (see Figure S4).

The produced
H2CO3 is still able to react
in two ways (see Table 1 and Figure 1). Indeed,
it has been experimentally observed that AN can be destabilized by
the presence of acidic species.29 In the
first path, AN in the presence of H2CO3 leads
to the formation of a complex [NH4NO3···H2CO3] (ΔG = −63.6
kcal/mol), which evolves into [NH3···HNO3···H2CO3] (ΔG = −69.6 kcal/mol) through a transition state TS3A with an energetic barrier of 0.8 kcal/mol. In the transition
state, a double displacement of protons occurs: one directly from
carbonic acid to the nitrate anion and a second one from ammonium
to bicarbonate (HCO3–), which forms H2CO3 again (by an endothermic decomplexation of
3.5 kcal/mol). The other possible reaction for carbonic acid is its
decomposition into carbon dioxide and water with a relative free energy
of 17.3 kcal/mol. Among these two pathways, the most favorable reaction
is the decomposition of H2CO3 into H2O and CO2, as also indicated by the experimental data.25−30

Following path B, calcium carbonate interacts with ammonia,
giving
the complex [NH3···CaCO3] through
an exothermic reaction (ΔG = −12.4 kcal/mol)
without an energy barrier. This new species, via a transition state
TS1B that presents an energetic barrier of 13.1 kcal/mol,
leads to a complex [NH2···CaCO3H] (Figure S5), releasing an energy equal
to −5.9 kcal/mol. Its further decomposition is highly exothermic
(>150 kcal/mol), as it can be seen from the data presented in Figure S6. Structural details of the transition
states are given in Table S1. This last
complex can accept a second molecule of ammonia, giving [NH2···CaCO3H···NH3] (ΔG = −14.2 kcal/mol, Figure S7), which does not undergo further proton
displacement. This path B presents less stable complexes than path
A, the latter also leading to stable species experimentally observed
[as Ca(NO3)2]. For this reason, path A (i.e.,
with HNO3) can be considered as the most favorable.

2.2 Reaction Mechanism between AN and CaSO4
Because few experimental data are available for
the AN/CaSO4 mixture, the reaction mechanism was investigated
in analogy to that identified for AN and CaCO3. It is depicted
in Scheme 2, and Gibbs
free energy profile is reported in Figure 2. The corresponding energy values are detailed
in Table 2. As before,
the reaction path A corresponds to the reactions between CaSO4 and HNO3, whereas path B concerns the reaction
with NH3.

and CaSO4.

[NH3···CaSO4H···NH2]	–25.2	–25.0	–16.8	
As for CaCO3, the first reaction of path A, where HNO3 simultaneously
interacts with the Ca atom and undergoes a
proton transfer to SO42–, is exothermic
and barrier-free, leading to the complex [NO3···CaSO4H] (ΔG = −56.8 kcal/mol, Figure S8). The complexation with a second molecule
of HNO3 gives two isomers, namely, [NO3···CaSO4H···HNO3]a (ΔG = −83.6 kcal/mol) and [NO3···CaSO4H···HNO3]b (ΔG = −68.1 kcal/mol), depending on the protonation
site on the sulfate (see Figure S8). The
first isomer evolves into [NO3···CaSO4H2···NO3]a (ΔG = −66.1 kcal/mol) passing through
the transition state TS2Aa that presents a barrier of 24.1
kcal/mol. The structures of these complexes are reported in Figure 3. Starting from [NO3···CaSO4H···HNO3]b, the other possible isomer is [NO3···CaSO4H2···NO3]b (ΔG = −64.9 kcal/mol)
passing through the transition state TS2Ab with a barrier
of 6.3 kcal/mol (see Figure 3). In both cases, the same products, Ca(NO3)2 and H2SO4, are formed. Indeed, the
two transition states, TS2Aa and TS2Ab, are
both characterized by the displacement of a proton from HNO3 to CaSO4, albeit from a different site (see Figure 3). More details about
these transition states are reported in Table S2.

Figure 3 Transition states and complexes of the reactions of HNO3 and CaSO4.

As previously considered
for H2CO3, H2SO4 is also
able to react in two different ways.
Indeed, it was experimentally identified as incompatible with AN.29 In the first path, AN in the presence of H2SO4 can lead to the formation of [NH4NO3···H2SO4] (ΔG = −47.1 kcal/mol), which evolves into the species
[NH3···HNO3···H2SO4] (ΔG = −46.9
kcal/mol) through TS3A with an energetic barrier of 1.3
kcal/mol (see Table 2 for energy values and Figure 2 for Gibbs free energy profile). The transition state presents
a double and simultaneous proton displacement from sulfuric acid to
nitrate and from ammonium to sulfate. At last, H2SO4 is regenerated, producing NH3 and HNO3 again with a barrier of 9.9 kcal/mol. The other possibility is the
endothermic decomposition of sulfuric acid, which requires 11.1 kcal/mol.
So, the catalytic destabilizing effect of H2SO4 on AN is in competition with its own decomposition.

Following
path B, ammonia reacts with CaSO4 forming
a first complex, [NH3···CaSO4] (ΔG = −14.0 kcal/mol, Figure S9), with an exothermicity of −19.4
kcal/mol. This first reaction is followed by a similar one, where
a second molecule of NH3 interacts with [NH3···CaSO4]. The resulting species, [NH3···CaSO4···NH3], is very stable (ΔG = −32.0
kcal/mol). Although no proton transfer is observed upon the addition
of the first ammonia molecule, the interaction with a second NH3 molecule makes such a reaction possible. The species [NH3···CaSO4H···NH2] (Figure S10) is stable (ΔG = −16.8 kcal/mol), passing through a transition
state TS2B with a barrier of 21.9 kcal/mol. Further decomposition
of [NH3···CaSO4H···NH2] was not investigated because reaction path B is energetically
less favorable than path A. Furthermore, previous experimental studies
on AN’s reactivity in the presence of CaCO325−30 demonstrated that reactions with HNO3 were more favored
than the ones with NH3. The same was proved here for CaSO4.

The obtained results clearly indicate that CaCO3 can
easily intercept the proton of HNO3, thus avoiding the
decomposition of nitric acid in the highly reactive species. Indeed,
the capture of the proton is strongly exothermic (ΔG = −67.1 kcal/mol), whereas the radical production (in pure
AN decomposition) is endothermic (ΔG = 40.2
kcal/mol). Moreover, when AN reacts with this stabilizer, there is
no production of reactive species (OH• and NO2• radicals)
but rather the formation of stable complexes that evolve into stable
molecules, such as H2O, CO2, and Ca(NO3)2. These results suggest a direct relationship between
the ability of the carbonate to accept the proton from nitric acid
and the inhibitor behavior observed experimentally for this additive.

A similar behavior is observed for the reaction with CaSO4, even if the energy release is slightly lower (ΔG = −83.6 kcal/mol for the most stable products) and the proton
transfer is less exothermic (ΔG = −56.8
kcal/mol). Other differences between CaSO4 and CaCO3 can be then observed looking at the single reaction steps.
For CaSO4, only the first reaction with HNO3 is spontaneous (ΔG = −56.8 kcal/mol).
The second one passes across a proton transfer and two distinct transition
states that have a similar relative free energy (ΔG TS2Aa = −59.5 kcal/mol with a barrier of 24.1
kcal/mol and ΔG TS2Ab = −61.8
kcal/mol with a barrier of 6.3 kcal/mol). Therefore, the tendency
of CaSO4 to uptake a proton from the second molecule of
HNO3 is lower compared to the one considered for the second
protonation of CaCO3. This could explain a less important
inhibitor capability than CaCO3.

Finally, the reaction
between AN and CaCO3 or CaSO4 leads to similar
reaction products: in both cases, Ca(NO3)2 and
a molecule of acid, H2CO3 or H2SO4. This last step represents
another significant difference between CaCO3 and CaSO4 in terms of stabilization effect on AN. Indeed, H2CO3 preferentially decomposes into CO2 and
H2O, whereas H2SO4 can decompose
into SO4 and H2O or react directly with AN.38 Indeed, this last reaction produces NH3 and HNO3 with a barrier of 9.9 kcal/mol, whereas H2SO4 decomposes into SO4 and H2O with a ΔG of 11.1 kcal/mol. This catalytic
effect of H2SO4 on AN balances the inhibition
effect of CaSO4 issued from the production of stable complexes.
This could explain the inert behavior experimentally observed for
CaSO4.20 Indeed, experimental
tests have evidenced that the increase of CaSO4 concentration
in the AN mixture does not cause an increment of the decomposition
temperature.20

3 Conclusions
The detailed computational analysis of the reaction energy profile
of AN decomposition in the presence of CaCO3 and CaSO4 not only evidences the molecular mechanisms but also underlines
their role as stabilizers in AN formulations. Indeed, both anions,
CO32– and SO42–, capturing an acid proton from AN are able to avoid the production
of highly reactive radicals coming from the decomposition of pure
AN. These two anions are involved in similar reaction mechanisms,
which are characterized by the formation of a stable product, Ca(NO3)2, and an acid, H2CO3 for
calcium carbonate and H2SO4 for calcium sulfate.
However, while carbonic acid decomposes into H2O and CO2, sulfuric acid could interact with AN, partially balancing
the afore-mentioned stabilizing effect of the deprotonation. These
results are in agreement with the experimental observation, CaSO4 presenting a profile more similar to an inert rather than
an inhibitor of AN decomposition, the latter clearly observed in the
case of CaCO3.

More in general, these results show
how modern computational techniques,
based on accurate quantum mechanical methods [here density functional
theory (DFT)], could help in improving the knowledge on complex reaction
mechanisms at the base of compatibility (incompatibility) phenomena.

4 Computational Methods
Following previous works on AN
decomposition,22−24 all reaction
intermediates were identified using an approach rooted in DFT based
on the M06-2X functional39 and the 6-311+G(2d,2p)
basis set.40 Such a functional provides
the most accurate decomposition energies for AN, taking as references
the CBS-QB3 values.22

The identified
intermediates were then characterized as minima
(absence of imaginary frequency) or as transition states (one imaginary
frequency). Intrinsic reaction coordinate calculations were also performed
to confirm that the identified products and reactants were correctly
connected by the proposed transition states.41 Reaction energies, enthalpies, and Gibbs free energies (at 298 K
and 1 atm) were computed for all identified reaction intermediates,
but only Gibbs free energies will be discussed in the following. More
details on the computational approach can be found in the Supporting Information.

All calculations
were carried out with the Gaussian program.42
