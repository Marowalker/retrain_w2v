The
cargo-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) with convenient
surface modification can facilitate the development of the innovative
nanodrug system. Herein, the present investigation described the electrostatically
self-assembled MSNs as a nanosized drug carrier to realize potent
synergistic chemotherapy based on the specificity in targeting cytoplasm
and nucleus of tumor cells. In this context, the primarily constructed
MSNs were subjected with anticancer drug topotecan (TPT) into its
large pores. Then, the selective TAT peptide (a nuclear localization
signal peptide) was anchored onto TPT-loaded MSNs (TPT-MSN). Subsequently,
the positive surface of TPT-MSN-TAT was capped with negatively charged
components, poly(acrylic acid) (PAA)-cRGD peptide and citraconic anhydride
(CAH)-metformin (MT), and acted as a smart gatekeeper. Comparatively,
PAA-cRGD attached onto MSNs serving as the targeted molecules could
upsurge by invasion into cancer cells. Interestingly, the acidic pH
of the lysosomal compartment in tumor cells triggers the conjugated
CAH from the polymer decorated mesoporous silica (PMS) nanocomposite
and could efficiently release MT into the cytoplasm. Consequently,
the remaining TPT-MSN-TAT efficiently targets the nucleus and delivers
the TPT to improve synergistic chemotherapeutic effects. The precisely
released drugs were individually enhanced in the in vitro and in vivo cell killing efficiencies. Thus, the
study provides a potential drug delivery podium through combined drugs
to realize cancer cell targeting approach.

Introduction
The development of
cancer therapy with the capability of selective
therapeutic agent’s delivery into cancer cells is one of the
most attractive strategies to improve cancer treatment.1 Of late, drug design research highly encourages
the nanoparticle-dependent combination chemotherapy, and still, it
is a valid option for cancer treatment. In this regard, multivalent
antitumor drugs have been used together through a single nanoscopic
system which may afford a significant synergistic effect against breast
cancer cells with prominent cytotoxicity.2,3 Recently,
Kang et al. have developed a tumor targeting liposome assisted combination
of dihydroestemisia (DHA) and doxorubicin (DOX) to overcome the drug-resistant
colon cancer cells.4 Another promising
strategy developed by Zhang et al. through encapsulation of paclitaxel
(PTX) and tetrandrine (TET) inside the drug carrier offers efficient
multidrug-resistant cancer therapy.5 Comparatively,
most of the previously reported codelivery systems have increased
the attention in discharging the combinational drugs extensively in
the cytoplasm, and except in the nucleus, this kind of delivery behavior
is more favorable to reducing combination effects and strong utility
of those drugs.6,7 The effective antitumor efficacy
of nanomedicine at a clinically prescribed dosage is quite tedious
to generate new nanoformulation for a combating drug delivery. More
precisely, the delivery of drugs to the targeted regions (nucleus
and cytosol) individually enhances the treatment strategy of cancer.8 In spite of thise, many researches have given
attention to the controlled release of cargos with the tunable properties
of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) as an agreeable nanosystem
in the interdisciplinary research of nanomedicine. In particular,
MSNs are more prevailing pharmaceutical nanoscopic drug delivery containers
with respect to their large tunable porosity, extraordinary pore volume,
extended surface regions, good biocompatibility, and leniency functionalized
with various molecules.9,10 Thus, they provide numerous possibilities
to determine the amount of drug and site-specific release of cargo
in controlled manner for the enhanced cancer therapy.11 Most of the existing reports have focused on the dual drug
loaded MSN to pursue specifically as stimuli-responsive releasing
chemotherapeutic drugs at the tumor sites.3,12 The
pH sensitivity of the nanocomposite is one of the “added advantages”
to release the drug into targeted sites. Moreover, the optimum pH
that triggers the drugs to draw out from nanomaterials for the site-specific
release of drug molecules into the tumor cells is the “guest
to ghost” (cancer cells) phenomenon. The clinical success of
chemotherapeutic drugs depends upon the right selection of cargo as
well as their ability to release drugs into targeted tissues/cells.
Moreover, a tumor vasculature homing peptide, arginine-glycine-aspartic
acid (cRGD) influenced the cancer cell endocytosis and particle accumulation
by recognizing its counterpart on the tumor cell membrane which is
overexpressed on many cancer cell surfaces.13

In view of the above, the present study pertains to a new
approach
of self-assembly and polymer-decorated mesoporous silica (PMS) nanocomposites
for the intelligent subcellular (cytosol and nucleus) delivery of
model anticancer drugs. The siliceous small pores of MSN were loaded
initially with topotecan (TPT), and then, the surface of the TPT-MSN
was modulated by TAT (a nuclear localization signal peptide) and has
the ability to transport TPT inside the subcellular nucleus via the
connection with the import receptors (importin α and β
(karyopherin)) on nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) with a diameter ranging
from 20 to 70 nm.14−18 In addition, PAA-cRGD and CAH-MT were subsequently capped on the
surface of TPT-MSN-TAT, denoted as PMS nanocomposites. The PMS nanocomposite
with cRGD peptide influences their internalization by cancer cells
through interaction between the cRGD peptide and integrin receptor.
Later, the CAH gets dissociated at acidic pH, which enhances the steadily
release of MT, and afterward, the TAT-conjugated PMS nanocarriers
act as a DNA disruptor by transport of anticancer drug (TPT) into
the nucleus. Moreover, the in vitro synergistic effects
and intracellular drug release, targeted ability, subcellular distribution,
and in vivo therapeutic efficiency were performed
to investigate the effects of the PMS nanocomposite.

Results and Discussion
To construct versatile nanosized mesoporous silica nanocomposites,
the MSN-NH2 was foremost prepared by the base-catalyzed
sol–gel process. The synthesis procedure is outlined in Scheme 1. The MSN-NH2 has plenty of pores used to accommodate the enormous amount
of topotecan (TPT) by a simple diffusion process. Subsequently, the
amino-functionalized MSN surface was modified by FITC-labeled TAT
peptide to obtain TPT-MSN-TAT. Then, PAA-cRGD and CAH-MT were added
(1:3 ratio) and adsorbed onto the outer surface of TPT-MSN-TAT through
electrostatic forces. The cRGD offers a tumor targeting agent that
obviously thwarts cancer cells through cRGD−αvβ3
interaction. At this crisis, acidic pH (4.8–5.5) encourages
the release of a second drug MT from CAH through electrostatic repulsion.
Consequently, TPT-MSN-TAT influenced nuclear internalization, and
the driving force pushed the cationic TPT away from the MSNs within
the nucleoplasm. The result evidenced that the PMS nanocomposite could
emerge as an agreeable nanodrug system to induce synergistic chemotherapy
via expected delivery of cargo directly in cytosol and nucleus compartments
as reported.8 In TEM analysis, Figure 1A shows a discrete,
spherical morphology of MSNs with a diameter ranging from 43 to 50
nm, and also the large deep-rooted pore structures evenly distributed
in the core of MSNs were observed. The TEM micrographs in Figure 1B and 1C show the thickness as well as a thin gray outer layer around
the MSN, which entails the presence of organic moieties that covered
the MSN core–shell and PMS nanocomposites, thereby producing
a range between 45 and 54 nm in diameter. In addition, almost all
the pores on the MSNs were filled with drug moieties which were confirmed
through TEM analysis. The previous report suggested that the diameter
of MSN-TAT was around 50 nm or smaller, which could enhance selective
nuclear uptake and subsequently deliver the active anticancer drug
that leads to cancer cell lethality.19 Further,
the nitrogen adsorption and desorption measurements (Figure 1D and 1E) were recorded with their respective surface area, pore volume,
and pore diameter. These parameters get decreased progressively after
every amendment during synthesis of PMN nanocomposites. The bare MSN
exhibited their surface area (805 m2 g–1), pore volume (1.44 cm3 g–1), and narrow
BJH pore size distribution (average pore diameter 3.0 nm), whereas
MSN-NH2 resulted in 660 m2 g–1, 0.88 cm3 g–1, and 2.7 nm, respectively.
The gradual decrease in the pore volume and pore size indicates the
modification of MSN surface by the amine groups. Simultaneously, the
surface area and pore volume of PMS nanocomposites had been reduced
to 92 m2 g–1 and 0.31 cm3 g–1, respectively, which further revealed the dominance
of organic moieties mostly in the surface of the particles. The percentage
of nanoformulations was determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA).
As depicted in Figure 1F, following heating to 1000 °C, the percentage of weight loss
of MSN-NH2 was displayed as 14.9%, which was increased
to 21.7% after the TAT modification. The weight loss of TPT-MSN-TAT-CAH-MT
and PMS nanocomposite obviously showed a considerable weight loss
of 27.6% and 33.6%, respectively. The TGA effect of PMS nanocomposite
had 5.9% greater weight loss than that of TPT-MSN-TAT-CAH-MT, which
could ensure the decomposition of functionalized components (PAA-cRGD).
The data depicted in Figure 1G displayed that the average hydrodynamic diameter of MSNs
at pH 7.4 was 46 nm with a value of 0.1 polydispersity index (PDI).
Additionally, Figure 1H confirms that the average particle size of PMS nanocomposites was
47.7 nm, with a minimal PDI of 0.03 and the greatest monodispersity
condition. It is noted that the size is slightly larger than MSN.
It proves to be a successful packing and conjugation of drug molecules
and polymers in pores and the surface of functionalized MSNs. As mentioned
earlier, a tiny nanosized particle is a substantial drug that can
enter across nuclear pore complexes (NPCs); thus, the tiny sized PMS
nanocomposite provides an excellent drug delivery.18,20

As in Table S1, the ξ potential
of the silanol functional group of MSN was negatively charged (−26.7
mV) at pH 7.4, and the MSN-NH2 was a positively charged
surface (+20.4 mV) since the external silanol group was instituted
to ingest the surface charge of the particles which was shifted from
−26.7 mV to +20.4 mV. Following grafting with TPT onto TPT-MSN-TAT
leads to the dramatic increase in surface charge (+28.1 mV). Following,
the TPT-MSN-TAT are modified with negatively charged PAA+cRGD with
CAH+MT layers, and the potential changes from +28.1 mV to +18.4 mV.
As depicted in Figure S1, the stability
of the PMS nanocomposite in 10% mouse serum (mSerum) suspended in
DMEM or 0.01 M of PBS (pH 7.4) exhibits a small size change after
48 h. Interestingly, the obtained result reveals that the prepared
PMS nanocomposite was found to maintain its integrity and stability
under the physiological pH for 48 h (2 days). Generally, MSNs with
positive charge seem to be endocytosed more rapidly since this might
be expected to bind negatively to the charged cell surface.21 Moreover, the previous literature indicates
the positively charged nanoparticles exhibit prolonged circulation
with improved retention time. Further, Wim et al. and Andre et al.
are in agreement with our hypothesis that the positive charge of the
nanoproduct could play an outstanding role in delivery of drugs and
other ligand molecules.22,23

As shown in Figure 2A, the UV–vis
absorbance was conducted for the preliminary
conformation of TAT modification on MSN-NH2. Further, this
was clearly depicted by the appearance and disappearance of the characteristic
peak of fluorescene isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugated at the N-termini
of the TAT onto MSN. Presently recorded results are in support with
the previous report on successful modification of the MSN surface
with FITC-labeled TAT.19 From Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic analysis (Figure 2B), the complete removal of surfactant CTAC
from MSN was clearly confirmed by the disappearance of the C–H
peak in the spectrum wavelength range (3000–2800 cm–1) for the CTAC-extracted MSNs. Subsequently, characteristic peaks
observed in the spectrum of MSN-NH2, the peak at 1583 cm–1 expectedly to the stretching vibration of −NH2 bending, and the appearance of C–H stretching vibrations
at 2930 cm–1 were confirmed by the presence of amine
groups on the surface MSNs. As-prepared TPT-MSN-TAT-CAH-MT displayed
the new peaks at 1553 and 1718 cm–1, which could
belong to the N–H bending vibration of CAH-MT. Final modification
with PAA-cRGD on the surface of TPT-MSN-TAT-CAH-MT provides the C=O
stretching vibration in the amide group and the C=O stretching
vibration in the carboxyl group, respectively, which indicates the
successful grafting of PAA-cRGD on the surface of TPT-MSN-TAT-CAH-MT,
denoted as the PMS nanocomposite.

(green), and PMS nanocomposite (blue).

Drug Loading
The present result disclosed that the obtained
MSNs have high intrinsic
pore volume that could be used to encapsulate the anticancer drugs
with high loading efficiency. The loadings of TPT and MT on MSNs were
achieved based on the principle of adsorption and hydrophobic interaction,
and this result was in agreement with the earlier report.24−26 Despite this, the TPT (positively charged) maintains electrostatic
interaction with SiO– (negatively charged) groups
in MSN pores at physiological pH. The second drug MT was trapped into
the CAH. The positively charged surface of TPT-MSN-TAT was functionalized
with negatively charged CAH with MT by the electrostatic interaction.
The drug uptake property and encapsulation efficiency of PMS nanocomposites
were found to be 15.5 and 87.5% for TPT and 20.1 and 77.7% for MT,
respectively. Thus, the PMS nanocomposite possesses both high drug
loading capacity and releasing efficiency and could induce high rate
of cytotoxic effects on cancer cells.27,28

Drug Release
To evaluate the potential releasing property of TPT and MT from
PMS nanocomposites, the PMS nanocomposites were dissolved in PBS buffer
solution at different pH (7.4, 7.3, 6.8, 5.5, and 4.8) for up to 48
h at 37 °C. Figure 3A shows the drug release rate of TPT, and Figure 3B explains MT release behavior from the PMS
nanocomposite. Further inspection manifested that approximately 13.1%
of TPT was released at the pH of 7.4 within 48 h, whereas the MT release
profile was recorded as 17.3% in 24 h. At pH 7.4, the discharge behaviors
of drugs was lowered from PMS nanocomposites, which indicates that
the surface and the openings of mesopores of MSNs were tightly capped
by PAA and CAH-MT. Remarkably, at 48 h, the TPT and MT release was
recorded as 41.6% and 60.2% at pH 6.8, respectively. Interestingly,
at pH 5.5 and 4.8, the release rates of TPT (57.61% and 88.8%) and
MT (68.8% and 93.3%) were calculated, respectively. Nevertheless,
the present findings clearly demonstrated that both drugs are released
at a higher rate at pH 5.5 and pH 4.8, due to the rapid dissociation
of the CAH and PAA from TPT-MSN-TAT to accelerate the drug release.
To gain insights into the process of dissociation and acceleration,
the underlying pH-dependent drug release might occur by an altered
interactive force between drug molecules and PMS nanocomposites. Surprisingly,
at pH 5.5 and 4.8 (endosomal and lysosomal pH), the negatively charged
CAH is protonation; it could trigger the reversal conversion of the
negatively charged CAH into positively charged citraconic acid; and
it causes the electrostatic interaction between CAH-MT to stimulate
the release of MT at the cytoplasm from PMS nanocomposites. Then,
detachment of CAH-MT and PAA layers influences the exposure of amine-functionalized
TPT-MSN-TAT (small size <50), and the conjugated TAT peptide facilitates
the intranuclear distribution through the nuclear pore complexes.
As depicted in Figure S2, normally the
cell nucleus had a pH of ≈7.3,29 and at this condition, the carboxylic group in TPT (pKa = 11.7) causes electrostatic repulsion with negatively
charged mesoporous structure (SiO−) and could trigger the TPT
remaining in the MSNs-TAT to be discharged within the nuclei. The
antineoplastic activity was enhanced along with the increase in the
intranuclear TPT concentration.26 The discharged
amount of TPT from TPT-MSN-TAT was calculated as 52.5% for 48 h at
37 °C. Thus, the present findings are in agreement with the earlier
reports that strongly emphasize the notion that the drug loading and
release are pH-dependent processes.30−32 The premature discharge
behaviors of TPT and MT from the PMS nanocomposite at pH 7.4 were
found to be limited. This might effectively decrease the undesired
side effects in normal tissues, while these nanocomposites are in
circulation. The pH-sensitive drug discharge capabilities are perfectly
sponsored by an endocytosis process. Moreover, there is increasing
evidence to support the hypothesis of the present study that the discharge
of drug in an acidic environment (pH 4.8–5.5) might enhance
the therapeutic benefits of the PMS nanocomposite in cancer treatment.33,34 Together with the slow and steady discharge profile of TPT at the
nuclear pH from PMS nanocomposites by active nuclear transport via
TAT targeting, this induces sustained discharge of TPT thereafter.

In Vitro Cytotoxicity
The cytotoxicity
of TPT, MT, TPT+MT, TPT-MSN-TAT, TPT-MSN-TAT-CAH-MT, and PMS nanocomposites
was quantitatively evaluated by MTT assay. The various concentrations
(0.05–2 μg/mL) of drug and nanoformulations were incubated
with MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells for 48 h to evaluate
the cytotoxic effects. As shown in Figure 4A and 4B, the cytotoxicity
of various nanoformulations was also investigated. The cell cytotoxicity
of TPT+MT on both cancer cells was observed and showed a significant
increase as compared to free drugs (TPT and MT). The IC50 values of TPT+MT were found to be 0.623 μg/mL and 0.54 μg/mL,
whereas the TPT accounts for 0.71 μg/mL and 0.65 μg/mL,
for cancer cells (MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells), respectively. This
cytotoxic effect could be attributed to the synergistic effects of
combination drugs on the cell viability at different incubation periods.
The IC50 value of TPT-MSN-TAT-CAH-MT was found to be 0.45
μg/mL and 0.37 μg/mL, for MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells,
respectively, which was much lower than that of TPT+MT, which could
be attributed to the delayed discharge of drugs. The IC50 values of PMS nanocomposites (0.18 μg/mL and 0.28 μg/mL)
had a lower IC50 value than that of TPT-MSN-TAT-CAH-MT.
The IC50 values of the nanoformulations were listed in Table S2. The results also showed that free drug
(TPT and MT) and combination drug (TPT+MT) showed better cytotoxic
effects in the MCF-7 cell than MDA-MB-231 cells. On the other hand,
the PMS nanocomposite shows the higher inhibitory effects on the growth
of MDA-MB-231 cells than in MCF-7 cells, indicating the overexpression
of integrin receptor on the surface of these cancer cells.3 The cRGD peptide of PMS nanocomposites binds
to the overexpressed ανβ3 integrins on MDA-MB-231
cancer cells, leading to the uptake of nanocomposites by receptor-mediated
endocytosis. Upon internalization, the PMS nanocomposite subsequently
releases TPT and MT in the cytosol, and the nucleus showed increased
combination effects and antiproliferative activities against cancer
cells (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231). Thus, the nuclear and cytoplasm-targeted
drug delivery by the PMS nanocomposites accomplishes the synergistic
anticancer activity. Then, the cells were incubated with MSN-PAA and
MSN-CAH which exhibited lower toxic effect than free drugs, revealing
the biocompatible nature of PMS nanocomposites (Figure 4C), that could effectively deliver dual drugs
into the cells and showed improved therapeutic activity.3

statistically significant.

Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM) Analysis
The uptake
of PMS nanocomposite by MDA-MB-231 cells was systematically
studied using CLSM. There are several reports stated on integrin receptors
which are found to express in tumor cells as well as breast cancer
cells that specifically recognize RGD peptides.35,36 The cRGD peptide-grafted PMS nanocomposites stimulated the selective
uptake by cancer cells, and it was expected that they could more easily
transport into the cancer cell membrane.37 As in Figure 5, the
specific cellular uptake was studied at different time intervals (6,
12, 18, and 24 h). In Figure 5A and 5B, after incubation with the
PMS nanocomposite (IC50 concentration) for 6 and 12 h,
respectively, there was a significant increase of fluorescent intensity
in cytoplasm as compared to the nucleus. Besides, it could be observed
in Figure 5C that the
PMS nanocomposite significantly possesses higher percentage of cellular
uptake in nucleus than in the cytoplasm, indicating FITC-labeled TAT-grafted
TPT-MSN with <50 nm size enhanced nuclear internalization after
18 h. Additionally, the fluorescence image (Figure 5D) revealed that the increased amount of
green fluorescence emerged in the nucleus after 24 h, which demonstrated
that the TAT-grafted TPT-MSN might be completely transported inside
the nucleus. As depicted in Figure 5E, FITC intensity was analyzed by a fluorescence plate
reader, after PMS nanocomposite treatment in MDA-MB-231 cells. Therefore,
it is assumed that the incorporation of cRGD peptide and TAT peptide
on the PMS nanocomposite surface could improve the receptor-mediated
endocytosis and subsequently discharged MT at the cytoplasm. Thereafter,
the TAT-mediated nuclear internalization would assist the TPT to release
into the nucleus.

time intervals (A) 6 h, (B) 12 h, (C) 18 h, and (D) 24 h, verifying
the intracellular location of FITC-labeled PMS nanocomposites. (E)
Graph showing the quantitative analysis of intracellular location
of the PMS nanocomposites at different time intervals.

Furthermore, the cell uptake efficacy of with or
without cRGD-grafted
PMS nanocomposites on MDA-MB-231 cells was examined. As shown in Figure 6A, after incubation
with PMS nanocomposite in the absence of cRGD, peptide conjugation
exhibits lower cellular uptake in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells than
that of the cRGD-grafted PMS nanocomposites, after 24 h. As depicted
in Figure 6B and 6C, a significant increase of fluorescent intensity
was observed in peptide-conjugated PMS nanocomposites, and the uptake
of MDA-MB-231 cancer cells is twice as high as that of the PMS nanocomposite
without peptide conjugation. Hence, it is expected that PMS nanocomposite
with grafted cRGD improves uptake by tumor cells and enhances anticancer
efficacy.3,36

PMS Nanocomposite Internalization
by Bio-TEM Images
The PMS nanocomposite internalization into
MDA-MB-231 cells was confirmed
by Bio-TEM images in Figure 7. After 24 h incubation, PMS nanocomposite tethered cRGD peptide
treatment could enhance the targeting of MDA-MB-231 cells. This strategy
unambiguously shows the advantage of delivering the drugs into the
cytoplasm and nucleus, respectively.

by MDA-MB-231 cells witnessed the accumulation of nanocomposites in
the cytoplasm and nucleus. (A) and (B) TEM image reveals PMS nanocomposites
get internalized into the cell membrane through receptor-mediated
endocytosis. (C) and (D) TEM images of PMS nanocomposites distributed
within the cancer cells. (E) and (F) The PMS nanocomposites distributed
throughout the nucleus. Red arrows point out the distribution of spherical
shaped PMS nanomaterials. Scale bar = 1 μm.

The bio-TEM analysis witnessed the encapsulated PMS nanocomposite
and perfect delivery of drugs into the organelle level. Figure 7A and 7B clearly demonstrates that the receptor-mediated endocytosis facilitated
the internalization and accumulation of spherical-shaped PMS nanocomposites.38 The yellow arrows indicate particle internalization,
whereas the pink color arrow points out the entry of the PMS nanocomposite
via receptor-mediated endocytosis and accumulation as well as distribution
in the cytoplasm. Meanwhile no nanocomposite was noticed in the nucleus.
Typically, the PMS nanocomposite with cell-targeting ligand was internalized
via receptor-mediated endocytosis, which certainly transports into
lysosomes.39 These acid vesicles are pivotal
organelles to begin the pH-responsive dismantling of the PMS nanocomposite
and thus switch on the intracellular functions. In Figure 7C and 7D, the red arrow illustrates numerous spherical shaped particles
that could be reported in the intracellular region of the tumor cell,
which demonstrated that a greater amount of PMS nanocomposites were
uptaken by the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. As a subsequent event
of endocytosis, the PMS nanocomposite was processed in lysosomes and
then eventually released the MT into the cytoplasm; afterward the
polymer was disassembled, and as a result, TPT-MSN-TAT remained in
cytosol. In addition, the red arrows show (Figure 7E and 7F) the accumulation
of TPT-MSN-TAT that was sporadically located within the nucleus. Instead,
a number of black color spherical particles were identified as nanoparticles
agreeing to their shape and size, and further PMS nanocomposites exhibited
effective internalization and distributions in the nucleus and released
the drugs at a controlled manner.40,41 The previous
reports of Lu et al. have studied that the uptake of MSNs into HeLa
cells with varied sizes from 30 to 280 nm in which they found that
50 nm sized MSNs could enter into the cancer cells, efficiently.42 It is noteworthy that the presently obtained
result suggests the functional relevance of PMS materials as a carrier
for cargos such as TPT and MT release at the subcellular level.

Analysis of Nuclear Morphology by Fluorescence Microscopy
As seen from Figure 8, the effects of TPT, MT, TPT+ MT, TPT-MSN-TAT-CAH-MT, and PMS nanocomposites
(2 μg/mL) on the formation of apoptotic bodies in treated MDA-MB-231
cells were investigated by fluorescence microscopy. Therefore, the
cell nucleus was stained with blue luminescence fluorescent dye DAPI
(left), and we determined the nuclear condensation in cell death (apoptosis).
Thus, PMS nanocomposite-treated cells have condensed nucleus, nuclei
chromatins, gathering, and completely fragmented nuclear bodies, indicating
the apoptosis. The PMS nanocomposite induces a higher rate of antiproliferative
efficacy against MDA-MB-231 cells than free drugs (TPT and MT). Furthermore,
a large amount of green fluorescent emerged and randomly due to the
Rh-123 (middle) distributed in the cell cytoplasm, which determines
the loss of membrane potential (Δψm) of active mitochondria
in MDA-MB-231 cancer cells. The cytotoxic effects of free drugs in
the PMS nanocomposite induce instability of the mitochondrial integrity
and activation of caspases, leading to cell death (apoptosis). The
above results revealed that the cRGD peptide on PMS nanocomposites
released MT in the cytoplasm and TPT in nucleus, subsequently providing
higher apoptotis in MDA-MB-231 cells effected by induced mitochondrial
dysfunction and DNA disruption.43

images, and (left) merged images. Scale bar 50 μm.

ROS Generation in PMS Nanocomposite-Treated
Cells
As
depicted in Figure 9A, the measurement of ROS formation in breast cancer cells during
treatment with TPT, MT, TPT+MT, TPT-MSN-TAT-CAH-MT, and PMS nanocomposites
was examined. The fluorescence strength of DCFH-DA stain was detected
in treated MDA-MB-231 cells. Of note, 2.0 μg/mL of TPT induced
formation of ROS during 24 h of treatment. Co-treatment with TPT+MT
induced accumulation of ROS at a large level in cancer cells. The
TPT-MSN-TAT-CAH-MT increased ROS levels, while compared with free
drugs, and in spite of using targeting agents together, the content
of ROS is altered significantly. In contrast, the ROS level was increased
within 24 h in the cancer cell. These results indicate that the dual-targeted
PMS nanocomposites with targeted agent (cRGD) elevate ROS generation
synergistically. These results suggest the PMS nanocomposite-mediated
drugs distributed into tumor cells generate ROS as well as DNA damage
leading to apoptosis. Hence, the PMS nanocomposites were considered
as the most worthy materials to proficiently induce the ROS production
to activate intrinsic apoptotic proteins in cancer cells. Then, ROS
intensity was evaluated by a fluorescence plate reader (Figure 9B) in PMS nanocomposite-treated
MDA-MB-231 cells. Hence, the productions of increased levels of ROS
play a crucial function in the regulation of cell apoptosis.44

Figure 9 (A) Fluorescence images of MDA-MB-231 cells after treatment

nanodrug formulations and stained with DCFH-DA showed the effects
on ROS generation. (B) The quantitative analysis of ROS generation
using a plate reader in MDA-MB-231 cells. The data stand for mean
± SD, *p ≤ 0.05 was calculated statistically
significant. Scale bar 400× magnifications.

Flow Cytometry Analysis for Apoptosis
The MDA-MB-231
cells were treated with free TPT (46.72%), TPT+MT (52.15%), TPT-MSN-TAT-CAH-MT
(73.62%), and PMS nanocomposites (86.2%), and the IC50 values
after 48 h were subjected to staining with Annexin-V-FITC/PI dual
fluorescence staining, which discriminated the apoptotic cells from
live cells (Figure 10A–E). Annexin V-FITC, a specific apoptotic marker that could
be bound to cells in early apoptosis and propidium iodide (PI), binds
to late apoptotic cells, even when the cells are dead.45,46 The control cells showed slightly apoptotic activities (<5%),
when compared to the free drug, and after treating with the combined
drugs (TPT+MT) could induce more apoptotic cells in the case of cancer
cells. Figure 10F
shows the treatment effects of nanodrugs on MDA-MB-231 cells. Additionally,
the PMS nanocomposites exhibit more specifically tumor-targeted ability
and effective delivery of combined drugs at distinct tumor subcellular
regions that could enhance synergistic antitumor activity, resulting
from higher induction of apoptosis.47,48

In Vivo Cancer Treatment
The in vivo antitumor
effects of the normal saline, TPT, MT,
TPT+MT, TPT-MSN-TAT, TPT-MSN-TAT-CAH-MT, and PMS nanocomposites, were
evaluated at a dose of 5 mg/kg body weight during the intravenous
injection of the breast tumor bearing mice. As depicted in Figure 11A, the tumor volume
was recorded as 1113.00 ± 0.11 mm3 in saline-treated
mice at the end of the 24th day. Mice treated with TPT (750.05 mm3), MT (890 mm3), and TPT+MT (555 mm3), respectively, showed modest tumor growth suppression compared
to the saline-treated group. Interestingly, the tumor growth was noticed
as 430 mm3 in TPT-MSN-TAT-CAH-MT treated mice. However,
the enhanced tumor inhibition occurred in the mice groups treated
with PMS nanocomposites (163 mm3), due to the improved
cellular targeted efficiency of the PMS nanocomposite. As in Figure 11B, the body weight
of mice was calculated after each treatment. Mice administrated with
saline, TPT-MSN-TAT-CAH-MT, and PMS nanocomposites exhibited a gradually
increasing body weight, demonstrating the harmless nature of those
materials. In contrast, the mice treated with TPT had decreased body
weight compared to the control group. No adverse effect was noticed
in the selected vital organs of the animals treated with PMS nanocomposites
as similar to control. Besides, the organ damage and tissue disintegration
were observed in free drug (TPT) treated animals with the recommended
doses (Figure 11C).
Together, considering the data presented in histopathology studies
are in perfect agreement with the previous literature underlines that
the TPT-treated mice group showed obvious organ damage of necrosis
in kidney and heart tissues compared to the saline and PMS nanocomposite
treated mice group.49−51 Though several surface modifications have been employed
in the preparation of MSN to provide the desired properties, viz.,
toxicity, biodegradability, biocompatibility, and targeted drug delivery,
the half-life of the materials in circulation, excretion, and degradation
are the concerns to determine the safety of materials.52,53 As depicted in Figure 11D, the ratio of tumor concentration and liver concentration
was 5.9. In the case of PMS nanocomposites, the concentration of TPT
in tumor tissue was 2.96 times higher as compared to TPT. The enhanced
circulation time, as well as specific uptake of PMS nanocomposites
to αvβ3 receptors, could actively reduce the tumor growth.
The TPT concentration in the heart, lungs, and kidney for the two
formulations was not significant. This sequential investigation highlights
the need for novel silica-based nanocomposites to carry dual drugs
with target-specific delivery in the current field of nanomedicine.

nanomaterials in vital organs and their efficacy in minimizing tumor
growth. (A) Tumor volume. (B) Body weight of mice treated with saline,

Figure 12A and 12B reveals the mice tumor section before
and after
the PMS nanocomposite treatment. The black arrows indicate that the
tumor regions in nontreated (Figure 12A) and in the tumor regions disappear in the mice that
were treated with PMS nanocomposites (Figure 12B). Figure 12C and 12D shows the heart tissue
of the mice treated at the final concentration (2 μg/mL) of
the TPT, (TPT+MT), and PMS nanocomposites. The free TPT and severe
damage occurred when compared to the other treated groups.54 It was observed that the combined drugs (TPT+MT)
reduce side effects during cancer therapy, and PMS nanocomposites
did not cause any side effects in mice cardiocytes. Also, the PMS
nanomaterials are capable of killing tumor cells with high efficiency,
whereas in the case of free drug-treated mice, although the highest
TPT concentration was found in tumor tissue, a substantial amount
was accumulated in the liver and heart, inducing severe cardiotoxicity.

and the breast tumor regions were collected. The breast tumor samples
revealed the effectiveness of treatment with different nanodrug formulations.
Among them, the PMS nanocomposite reduced the tumor cell population
at large in lobular regions of breast tumor bearing mice. These results
indicate that the dual drug loaded PMS nanocomposite directed uniquely
with dual targets produced a significant cancer therapeutics strategy.

Conclusion
To sum up the present findings, a successful
TAT-conjugated PMS
nanocomposite to realize efficient delivery of TPT and MT for targeting
cell nuclei and cytoplasm was developed. In view of the literature
survey, this is the first attempt in chemotherapeutic drug delivery
at a distinct subcellular manner with MSN, but it also displayed significant
cellular uptake by MDA-MB-231 cells. The in vitro cellular uptake process was visualized by CLSM and bio-TEM images.
The capabilities of PMS nanocomposites release MT in the cytoplasm
due to disassembled anionic PAA and CAH in response to acidic pH.
Subsequently, TAT conjugated on TPT-MSN could facilitate translocation
to the nucleus, resulting in facile release of active drug TPT. In
addition, released drugs from the PMS nanocomposites had preponderant
cytotoxicity on breast cancer cells. We also confirmed the good biocompatibility
and tumor suppression of PMS nanocomposites that inhibit tumor growth
even with negligible acute toxicity. The designed PMS accomplishes
precise delivery of discrete therapeutic efficacy to their individual
sites for achieving efficient synergistic cancer therapy with reduced
tumor populations in the mice model. Conclusively, the present findings
would bring the functionalized PMS nanocomposite, a prominent versatile
drug carrier which could act as an alternative in drug delivery for
efficient targeting of breast cancer. Thus, it holds a key that unlocks
the promise of breast cancer medicine.

sodium hydroxide (NaOH), tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), (3-aminopropyl)
triethoxysilane (APTES), poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), citraconic anhydride (CAH), (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole)
(DAPI), paraformaldehyde, N-(3-(dimethylamino)-propyl)-3-ethyl
carbodiimide (EDC), 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate
(DCFH-DA), rhodamine-123, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugated
TAT (FITC-TAT), metformin (MT), and topotecan (TPT) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (India).

Synthesis of MSN Nanoparticles
The
general route for
the synthesis of MSN-NH2 was carried out by the previously
described protocol.55 Typically, CTAC (0.25
g) and NaOH (50 μL, 2 M) were added into 150 mL of distilled
water and gradually stirred at 80 °C for 1 h. Then, TEOS (1 mL)
was introduced successively into the reaction solution, by continuously
stirring at 80 °C for 3 h. The synthesized nanoparticles were
centrifuged and purified by deionized water and methanol and dried
overnight. Consequently, the product was refluxed to remove the surfactant
(CTAC) by adding 1.5 mL of HCl, 20 mL of methanol, and 1% sodium chloride
(NaCl) at 80 °C for 5 h. Final products were obtained by centrifugation
and washed thoroughly with ethanol and dried overnight.

The
MSN nanoparticles were heated at 80 °C for 3 h, and APTES (5
mL) was added to modify the surface of MSNs with amine groups. The
final products were centrifuged and rinsed with ethanol and deionized
water.

Topotecan-Loaded MSN-NH2
An amount of 100
mg of MSN-NH2 and topotecan hydrochloride (1 mg/mL) was
successively introduced into 10 mL of PBS (10 mM, pH 7.4). Afterwards,
the solution was reacted at room temperature under stirring overnight.
The final product was isolated by gradient centrifugation and rinsed
with PBS three times. The TPT-loaded MSN-NH2 was stored
in a refrigerator at 4–8 °C until further use. The loading
efficacy of drug in nanoparticles was measured by a UV–vis
spectrometer at 510 nm, similar to a method reported previously.3

TAT Conjugation with TPT-MSN-NH2
To form
TPT-MSN-TAT, 50 mg of MSNs was dissolved in 10 mL of PBS (pH 7.4),
into which 0.5 mg of FITC-TAT was slowly added. Then, 0.3 mM EDC and
0.6 mM NHS were added and stirred at 37 °C for 6 h to activate
the carboxylic group of TAT. Unreacted TAT-FITC, EDC, and NHS were
separated by centrifugation. The excess TAT-FITC was calculated by
UV–vis spectra at the peak of 495 nm.

Synthesis of PAA-cRGD Peptide
Combination
To form PAA-cRGD,
typically, 4 mgof EDC and 6 mg of NHS were added into 10 mL of PBS;
further, 20 mg of PAA was introduced, by stirring for 6 h. Then, 5.5
mg of cRGD was added to the reaction mixture and stirred continuously
for 6 h. Then, the final product was harvested by centrifugation and
repeatedly purified by deionized water and ethanol.

Preparation
of CAH-MT combination
To synthesize CAH-MT,
40 mg CAH and 60 mg MT were added to 5 mL of HEPES buffer (pH 7.2).
The reaction products was stirred for 12 h and harvested by centrifugation
and purified by distilled water.

Preparation of PMS Nanocomposite
Typically, 50 mg of
TPT-MSN-TAT was gradually added in PBS (pH 7.4); subsequently EDC
(0.2 mM) and NHS (0.5 mM) were added and allowed overnight. Then,
10 mg of PAA-cRGD and 30 mg of CAH-MT were introduced to the reaction
mixture and stirred for 12 h. Finally, the prepared PMS nanocomposites
were freeze-dried.

Characterization of Different Mesoporous
Silica Nanocomposites
The size and morphological structure
of samples were examined under
TEM (JEOL JEM 2100 TEM electron microscope). The size distribution
and surface charge of functionalized mesoporous silica nanocomposites
in a suspension were measured on a Zeta-sizer nanoparticle analyzer
(Malvern). The stability of PMS nanocomposites in 10% mouse serum
in DMEM (v/v) or 0.01 M PBS (pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 48 h was tested
by dynamic light scattering (DLS). The surface analysis was employed
by N2 adsorption isotherms at 77 K (Micromeritics ASAP2020
absorptiometer). The particle surface areas were assessed by the BET
(Brunauer–Emmett–Teller) method and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) method used to calculate the pore size distributions of particles.
FTIR spectroscopy was used to investigate the functional groups at
range of 500–4000 cm–1 in functionalized
MSNs (Thermo Scientific NICOLET 5700).

In Vitro Release of TPT and MT from PMS Nanocomposite
In the drug
release experiment, 100 mg of PMS nanocomposite was
suspended in a phosphate buffer saline (PBS) solution (1 mL) at corresponding
solution with varied pH (pH 7.4, 7.3, 6.8, 5.5, and 4.8), which was
enclosed by a dialysis bag (Mw = 14 000).
Furthermore, the dialysis setup was immersed in 10 mL of PBS at 37
°C for 3 h under magnetic stirring, and 1 mL of PBS was taken
out from the beaker at different time intervals, followed by replacing
the equal amount of fresh solution (PBS). Finally, the volume of drug
discharged from PBS solution was measured using a UV–vis spectrophotometer
at the wavelength of 200–230 nm for MT and 480–510 nm
for TPT. The drug loading efficacy of PMS nanocomposite was calculated
as previously reported.56,57

In
Vitro Cytotoxic Assay
Cytotoxicity
study was carried out by an MTT assay. In brief, HBL-100 and MDA-MB-231
and MCF-7 cells were pipeted to a 96-well plate (5 × 103 cells/each well) in 90% DMEM medium for a fixed time at 37 °C
(5% CO2). After incubation for 24 h, the different concentrations
(0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.0, and 2.0 μg/mL) of TPT, MT, TPT+MT,
TPT-MSN-TAT, TPT-MSN-TAT-CAH-MT, and PMS nanocomposite were added.
Then, 5 mg/mL of 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT, 100 μL) solution was supplied and allowed to incubate
for 4 h. Finally, the produced formazan was diluted in 100 μL
of DMSO and observed at 570 nm using an ELISA analyzer (SPR-960).

Analysis of Cellular Uptake of PMS Nanocomposites by CLSM
The internalization of PMS nanocomposites into MDA-MB-231 cells
was evaluated by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Culture
cells were pipetted to 6-well plates (5 × 103 cells/well)
and permitted to adhere for 24 h. Then, the cell line was rinsed with
PBS and incubated with PMS nanocomposites (IC50 concentration)
for different intervals (6, 12, 18, and 24 h) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
for 1 h. The treated cells were observed on a CLSM (Carl Zeiss LSM
700).

Bio-TEM Observation
The endocytosis of PMS nanocomposites
was observed under bio-TEM. The cells were pipetted to 6-well plates
(5 × 103 cells/well) and allowed to complete adhesion.
After, the cells were incubated with PMS nanocomposites for 24 h,
after rinsing in PBS and fixed 2.5% glutaraldehyde at 4 °C overnight.
Then, unbound PMS nanocomposite was removed by using PBS solution
and fixed in epoxy resin and processed for thin-sectioning using an
ultramicrotome (thickness of 50–70 nm). Finally, sliced sections
were stained with 2% lead citrate and 5% uranyl acetate for 30 min
and observed by JEM-2100.

Analysis of Rhodamine 123 and DAPI Staining
The MDA-MB-231
cells were cultured in a 6-well plate (2 × 103 cells/well),
and independent treatment was performed with TPT, MT, TPT+MT, TPT-MSN-TAT-CAH-MT,
and PMS nanocomposites for 24 h and fixed with a diluted concentration
of nuclear staining DAPI (0.2 μg/mL) for 20 min at 37 °C.
Besides, these experimental cells were also treated independently
with 0.2 μg/mL of tracker dye Rh-123 and rinsed with PBS solution
and observed under a fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse 80i).

Evaluate the ROS Accumulation
The intracellular concentration
of mean fluorescent intensity of DCF at emission and excitation wavelengths
for quantitative assumption of peroxide and superoxide free radicals
was evaluated by pipetting 2 μg/mL of DCFH-DA (2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein
diacetate) to a 6-well plate (2 × 103 cells/well),
and independent treatment was performed with 2 μg/mL of TPT,
MT, TPT+MT, TPT-MSN-TAT-CAH-MT, and PMS nanocomposites for 24 h at
37 °C, respectively. Intracellular ROS accumulation was assessed
by a fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse).

Flow Cytometric Analysis
The effective treatment of
TPT, TPT+MT, TPT-MSN-TAT-CAH-MT, and PMS nanoparticles (IC50 concentrations) on the induction of apoptosis in the cancer cell
line was assessed by a flow cytometer using marker vital dyes (annexin
V/FITC and propidium iodide (PI)). Then, the treated cells were mixed
with 100 μL of binding buffer and followed by 2 μL of
annexin V-FITC and 5 μL of PI. The mixture was then incubated
for 20 min in lack of light at room temperature and observed under
a flow cytometer (BD, FACS Calibur, USA).

Assessment of Antitumor
Activity
For evaluating the in vivo treatment
efficacy of different particles and drugs,
athymic nude female mice around 18–21 g were used to investigate
tumor volume, body weight, and effects of in vivo antitumor activity. First, the nude mice were subcutaneously injected
with five million MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. After, the tumor
average diameter was reached at 200 mm3; the mice were
randomly divided into 5 groups (four mice per group). The different
experimental mice groups were intravenously injected with saline,
TPT, MT, TPT+MT, TPT-MSN-TAT, TPT-MSN-TAT-CAH-MT, and PMS nanocomposite,
respectively, and a dose of 5 mg/kg was administered every 3 days.
The mice were observed up to 24 days. The measurement of tumor size
and body weight calculation was performed every 3 days using the following
formula: TV = (L – W2)/2, with W being smaller than L. After the therapeutic experiment, the treated nude mice
were sacrificed using a CO2 inhalation method and the major
organ samples (brain, heart, liver, kidney, and lung) and breast cancer
tissue sections excised from necropsy and embedded in 10% formalin.
Then, each organ was independently embedded in paraffin, and thin-sectioning
(4 μm) of organ samples was placed and stained with H&E
(hematoxylin and eosin). The images were collected using a light microscope
(Olympus, BH-2). All of the above-mentioned animal experiments were
executed with complete protocols permitted by the IACUC (Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committees) guidelines.

Statistical Analysis
The value of each experiment was
independently conducted and performed in triplicate, and the data
were assessed using a mean ± standard error and student’s t test. The significance was statistically considered if p* < 0.05.
