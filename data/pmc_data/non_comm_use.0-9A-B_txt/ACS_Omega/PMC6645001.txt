This
study investigates the interactions of both purine (adenine
and guanine) and pyrimidine (cytosine, thymine, and uracil) nucleobases
with a pair of silver atoms (Ag2). Full geometry optimizations
were performed on several structures of each nucleobase/Ag2 complex and the corresponding isolated monomers using the M06-2X
density functional with a correlation consistent triple-ζ basis
set augmented with diffuse functions on all atoms and a relativistic
pseudopotential on Ag (aug-cc-pVTZ for H, C, N, and O and aug-cc-pVTZ-PP
for Ag; denoted aVTZ). Harmonic vibrational frequency computations
indicate that each optimized structure corresponds to a minimum on
the M06-2X/aVTZ potential energy surface. Relative electronic energies
for interactions between Ag2 and each nucleobase were compared
to elucidate energetic differences between isomers. Further analysis
of the changes in vibrational frequencies, infrared intensities, and
Raman scattering activities reveals how different Ag2 binding
sites might be differentiated spectroscopically. These results provide
molecular-level insight into the interactions between nucleobases
and silver, which may lead to better understanding and interpretation
of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy experiments on nucleobases
and related systems.

1 Introduction
The
groundbreaking scientific research to determine the structures
of DNA and RNA spanned several decades from the first discovery of
nucleic acids by Miescher to the famous double helix model by Watson
and Crick using Franklin’s X-ray crystallography work.1−3 These nucleotides are composed of a phosphate group, a pentose sugar
(ribose for RNA and deoxyribose for DNA), and one of five nucleobases.
The latter is classified as either purine-based (adenine and guanine)
or pyrimidine-based (cytosine, thymine, and uracil) and are the only
varying component of nucleotides. Because they encode genetic information
and are involved in many cellular processes, the ability to detect
and identify the individual nucleobases is a significant asset to
many fields of science, such as biology, biochemistry, analytical
chemistry, and medicine.4−8

Raman spectroscopy serves as a powerful analytical tool that
can
provide molecular fingerprints for vibrational modes that cause an
appreciable change in the polarizability of the molecule.9−15 Sensitivity, however, can sometimes be an issue because the technique
relies on relatively rare inelastic scattering events. For example,
the characterization of biomolecules with this technique becomes challenging
when concentrations and/or scattering cross-sections are low.14,16−18 Fortunately, these issues can sometimes be circumvented
via surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS).

First discovered
in 1974 through pyridine adsorption at a silver
electrode, SERS provides an attractive solution for weak scattering
in many cases.19 Upon binding of a molecule
onto a specially prepared metal surface or nanoparticle, such as silver
or gold, the weak Raman activity can be greatly enhanced (by up to
a factor of 1014). This optical enhancement can even provide
sufficient sensitivity for single-molecule detection.15,20−28 These enhancement factors facilitate the acquisition of high-resolution
vibrational spectra of biomolecules from very dilute aqueous solutions
down to 10–8 M.13,16,29−36 As such, the detection and identification of nucleotides have become
possible due to the unique SERS spectra of nucleobases.12,22,29,37−52

Although these nucleobases can exist in different tautomeric
forms, Figure 1 depicts
the structures
studied here that are typically found in DNA and RNA53,54 along with the common numbering convention for the ring atoms that
has been adopted for this work. Unlike pyridine, multiple adsorption
sites are available in the nucleobases, leading to greater complexity
surrounding the spectral interpretation from SERS experiments. The
position and magnitude of the Raman peaks depend on the detailed interactions
between the nucleobases and metal substrate.55−63 To provide detailed molecular-level insight into this phenomenon,
the present study employs density functional theory (DFT) to probe
the strength of the interactions between a pair of silver atoms (Ag2) and the various binding sites on each nucleobase. In addition,
the resulting perturbations to the IR and Raman spectra are also computed
to help discern the vibrational signatures associated to each binding
site of each nucleobase. This small Ag2 model has been
shown to reliably capture the key trends in the binding energetics
and spectra because the site of adsorption is typically considered
more important than the number of silver atoms at that site.17,25,56,64 Further, the enhancement mechanism and intermolecular distance dependence
are similar for small and large Ag clusters.17,25,37,56,64,65

2 Computational Details
Full geometry optimizations
were performed on several structures
of each nucleobase/Ag2 complex and the corresponding isolated
fragments using the global hybrid M06-2X density functional66 with a correlation consistent triple-ζ
basis set augmented with diffuse functions on all atoms and a relativistic
pseudopotential on Ag centers (aug-cc-pVTZ for H, C, N, and O and
aug-cc-pVTZ-PP for Ag; denoted aVTZ).67−70 Harmonic vibrational frequencies
(ω), IR intensities, and Raman scattering activities (RA) were
computed to confirm that each optimized structure corresponds to a
minimum (ni = 0) on the
M06-2X/aVTZ potential energy surface and to investigate changes in
the vibrational spectra of the nucleobase induced by complex formation.

The electronic energies of the fully optimized minima have been
used to quantify the strength of the various interactions between
the Ag2 unit and the nucleobases. The binding energy (Ebind) is defined as the energy of a particular
nucleobase/Ag2 complex relative to the isolated fragments
(Ebind = Ecomplex – Enucleobase – EAg2). The relative binding energies
(ΔEbind) compare all binding energies
to the largest magnitude Ebind value of
all of the complexes, whereas the relative energies (ΔE) effectively do the same thing for each nucleobase individually
rather than collectively.

All computations were performed using
analytic gradients and Hessians
available in the Gaussian09 software package.71 Pure angular momentum (5d, 7f, etc) atomic orbital
basis functions were used in place of their Cartesian counterparts
(6d, 10f, etc.) functions. Additionally, a pruned numerical integration
grid having 99 radial shells and 590 angular points per shell was
adopted. All electronic energies were converged to at least 1.0 ×
10–10Eh, and the maximum
Cartesian forces in the optimized structures were below 1.2 ×
10–5Eh au–1.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Structures
and Energetics
There are
a variety of interactions between Ag2 and electron-rich
regions of the nucleobases (i.e., π, N, and O). The adsorption
process is thought to involve an interaction of the π–electron
system of the heteroaromatic ring with a silver electrode.72 Nevertheless, all initial structures collapsed
during the geometry optimization procedure to those depicted in Figure 2, all of which exhibit
either N or O contacts with the Ag2 unit. The optimized
Cartesian coordinates of the nucleobase structures and nucleobase/Ag2 complexes are reported in the Supporting Information. Using these structures, intermolecular distances,
defined by the shortest distance between one of the Ag atoms and a
nucleobase atom, were computed and are denoted by the dashed lines
in each structure in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Structures of each nucleobase/Ag2 complex with varying
binding sites.

Table 1 compares
electronic binding energies (Ebind), relative
electronic energies (ΔE), relative electronic
binding energies (ΔEbind), and intermolecular
distances (R) of each nucleobase/Ag2 complex
shown in Figure 2.
In the cytosine/Ag2 complex, three potential binding sites
were identified, all of which show substantial differences in their
electronic energetics. The site with the Ag2 interacting
with the sp2 hybridized N (N3) exhibits the strongest binding
(Ebind = −17.4 kcal mol–1). The binding at the sp2 hybridized O site is 3 kcal
mol–1 higher and the sp3 NH2@C4 site is more than 9 kcal mol–1 higher when
compared to that of the N3 site, as indicated by the ΔE values in column 4. This large energetic difference among
the three possible binding sites in the cytosine/Ag2 complexes
indicates that the silver will most likely to bind to the N3 site
of cytosine. As seen in the last column of Table 1, the intermolecular distance for the N3
and sp2 O site are similar (around 2.34 Å), where
the sp3 N site is 0.16 Å longer than that of the N3
site. These trends in Ebind, ΔE, and R are not unique to cytosine/Ag2 and can also be seen in adenine/Ag2 and guanine/Ag2 complexes, as discussed below in the following paragraphs.

Four potential binding sites were identified in the
adenine/Ag2 complexes seen in the first row of Figure 2. Similar to that
of cytosine/Ag2, the site with Ag2 interacting
with N3 exhibits the strongest
binding (Ebind = −15.4 kcal mol–1). However, all of the sp2 hybridized N
binding sites (N3, N1, and N7) have very similar electronic energies
and fall within ±0.5 kcal mol–1 of each other
(i.e., ΔE = 1 kcal mol–1).
The out-of-plane binding at the sp3 N (NH2@C6),
on the other hand, is 7 kcal mol–1 higher in energy
than that of the sp2-hybridized N binding sites. In addition,
the intermolecular distance for the NH2 site increases
by around 0.15 Å when compared to that of the more energetically
competitive binding sites (2.33–2.35 Å).

As previously
discussed for the cytosine/Ag2 and adenine/Ag2 complexes, the guanine/Ag2 complex exhibits the
strongest binding at the sp2 hybridized N sites (Ebind = −14 kcal mol–1 at N3 and −15 kcal mol–1 at N7) with nearly
identical R values for both of these structures.
The sp2 O@C6 binding site exhibits binding similar to the
sp2 O site available in cytosine with Ebind approaching −14 kcal mol–1. The sp3 N (NH2@C2) is again the weakest binding
site, with a Ebind of only −7.4
kcal mol–1 and an R value of 2.50
Å, when compared to 2.35 or 2.36 Å for the other binding
sites.

All of the binding sites identified for thymine/Ag2 and
uracil/Ag2 have similar relative electronic energies (ΔE ≤ 1.4 kcal mol–1 for both nucleobase/Ag2 complexes). This is due to the absence of sp2-
or sp3-hybridized N site, which limits nucleobase/Ag2 interactions to sp2-hybridized O at C2 and C4
(rows 4 and 5 of Figure 2). In a similar fashion, the intermolecular distances across all
binding motifs are virtually identical with R values
at either 2.38 or 2.39 Å for the thymine/Ag2 and uracil/Ag2 complexes.

The Ebind column
in Table 1 indicates
that the strongest
interaction between the Ag2 unit and any of these five
nucleobases occurs at the N3 site of cytosine. This reference value
of Ebind = −17.7 kcal mol–1 is used to define the relative binding energies (ΔEbind) that are also reported in column 5 of Table 1. These ΔEbind values provide a convenient comparison
of the competitive binding energetics between the different nucleobases
in contrast to ΔE, which quantifies the competitive
binding energetics between different sites within the same nucleobase.
The data in the penultimate column of Table 1 help highlight that even though adenine
and guanine can bind the Ag2 unit by more than −15
kcal mol–1 electronically, those interactions are
more than 2 kcal mol–1 weaker than at the N3 sight
of cytosine. Similarly, thymine and uracil exhibit appreciable electronic
binding energies (Ebind = −10.4
± 0.9 kcal mol–1), but the corresponding ΔEbind values show that the binding is at least
6.1 kcal mol–1 weaker than the reference value for
Ag2 binding to cytosine at the N3 position, as shown in Figure 2. These relative
electronic binding energies suggest the likelihood of binding silver
in a competitive environment should decrease in the following order:
cytosine > adenine ≈ guanine > thymine ≈ uracil.

3.2 Vibrational Signatures
Table 2 shows the vibrational frequencies
(ω), Raman scattering activities (RA), and the corresponding
changes (Δω and ΔRA, respectively) associated to
each nucleobase/Ag2 complex depicted in Figure 2. The sp3-hybridized
N binding sites for cytosine/Ag2, adenine/Ag2, and guanine/Ag2 have been omitted from the following
discussion due to their large relative energies (ΔE > +7.5 kcal mol–1). However, all frequencies
and
Raman activities are reported in the Supporting Information. Vibrational modes in the spectral region of 800–2000
cm–1 have been found to contain a significant amount
of vibrational information about nucleobases73 and tend to produce intense Raman bands corresponding to the motion
of nonhydrogen atoms. In addition, this region has been found to be
the most effective at reproducing experimental frequency shifts in
a previous study of pyrimidine and its interactions with Ag2 and H2O molecules using the same level of theory utilized
here (M06-2X/aVTZ).17 Additional factors
also influence both the enhancement and the shifts of the Raman peaks
in SERS experiments, including the shape of the substrate/nanoparticle,
the dielectric constant of the material, and the surrounding medium
(solvent and other solute particles). These and other effects, such
as anharmonicity, complicate any direct comparison between computational
and experimental spectra, which is why previous attempts to do so
have met with varying degrees of success.23−25

Table 2 Vibrational Signatures of Isolated
Nucleobases and Nucleobase/Ag2 Complexes Computed at the
M06-2X/aVTZ Level of Theorya
a Selected harmonic vibrational frequencies
(ω in cm–1), Raman scattering activities (RA
in Å4 amu–1), and corresponding
changes upon complexation (Δω and ΔRA), respectively.

As noted in the previous section,
the binding energies of the cytosine/Ag2 complex are well
resolved for the different binding sites,
and this feature extends to the corresponding vibrational signatures.
Each of the six modes listed in Table 2 exhibits an appreciable change in the vibrational
frequency (Δω) and/or Raman scattering activity (ΔRA).
The RA of the N1–H wagging mode at 1454 cm–1, for example, is significantly enhanced by more than an order of
magnitude when Ag2 binds to the O@C2 site. However, there
is no substantial enhancement of this mode when Ag2 binds
to the N3 site. The C=O stretching mode of the cytosine monomer
at 1815 cm–1 decreases in frequency by −76
cm–1 and increases in Raman activity by +102 Å4 amu–1 when Ag2 binds to the
O@C2 site. In several experiments, this behavior was attributed to
a decrease in the double bond character of the carbonyl group as electrons
are donated to the silver surface.25,74,75 The same phenomenon in the carbonyl stretching modes
is also predicted in guanine/Ag2, thymine/Ag2, and uracil/Ag2 complexes and is discussed below. Experimentally,
the presence of a decrease in frequency and enhancement in Raman activity
of the C=O stretching band revealed the proximity of the carbonyl
group to the silver surface.74

In
the adenine/Ag2 complex, a synchronous C2N1/C2N3
stretching mode within the pyrimidine ring is predicted at 906 cm–1. When Ag2 binds to the N1 or N3 site,
there is an increase in frequency (+11 and +18 cm–1, respectively), but when Ag2 binds to the N7 site no
change in frequency or Raman activity is exhibited. An asynchronous
C2N1/C2N3 stretching mode is predicted at 1340 cm–1, where a similar change could be expected upon Ag2 binding.
Indeed, a shift to higher energy (+18 cm–1) is predicted
when Ag2 binds to the N1 site. However, there is essentially
no frequency shift (+1 cm–1) when Ag2 binds to the N3 site.

In the guanine/Ag2 complex,
a C=O stretching
mode at 1841 cm–1 experiences a substantial shift
to lower energy (−73 cm–1) when Ag2 binds to the O@C6 site, which is similar to the −76 cm–1 frequency shift predicted for the cytosine/Ag2 complexes. Additionally, a mode at 1342 cm–1 can be described as the wagging motion of the NH group nearest to
the carbonyl. When Ag2 binds to the O@C6 site, the frequency
and Raman activity both increase by +31 cm–1 and
+61 Å4 amu–1, respectively. The
N7 binding site can be differentiated through a solitary increase
in frequency (+15 cm–1) of the 1081 cm–1 mode upon Ag2 binding, which consists of stretching of
the five-membered ring. The N3 binding site, on the other hand, can
be distinguished through the frequency shift of +18 cm–1 for the 845 cm–1 mode.

In the thymine/Ag2 complex, the mode at 1840 cm–1 corresponds
to the C2=O stretching, whereas
the C4=O stretching is predicted to be at 1806 cm–1. When Ag2 binds to either of the two binding sites present
at the oxygen atom involved in C=O stretching, the frequency
significantly decreases (approximately −60 cm–1), whereas the Raman activity is notably enhanced for both sites.
When Ag2 binds to the oxygen atom not involved in the C=O
stretching, the mode shifts to higher energy (approximately +15 cm–1), whereas the Raman activity is only slightly affected.
Experimentally, the SERS spectra of cytosine and uracil have been
found to be similar due to the same pyrimidine moiety and a similar
geometry on the surface.76 Additionally,
the aforementioned trends in the thymine/Ag2 complex apply
directly to all of the uracil/Ag2 complex modes, especially
the carbonyl stretches at 1846 and 1821 cm–1.

4 Conclusions
A DFT analysis of the intermolecular
interaction between each nucleobase
and a pair of silver atoms along with the concurrent perturbations
to their Raman spectra have been presented in this work. All geometry
optimizations of a wide range of initial structures collapsed to minima,
in which the Ag2 unit was bound to either an N or O atom
(Figure 2). For all
purine- and pyrimidine-based nucleobase/Ag2 complexes,
intermolecular separations (R) range from 2.33 to
2.39 Å for all sp2 contacts and 2.50–2.51 Å
for the sp3 contacts. The electronic binding energies of
these complexes are significant and range from −7.4 to −17.4
kcal mol–1. With only sp2 O binding sites
available in thymine and uracil, the Ebind values are very similar and only span a narrow range of −10.4
± 0.9 kcal mol–1. In contrast, the other three
nucleobases have very different binding energies (by as much as 10.0
kcal mol–1) for the sp2 O, sp2 N, and sp3 N sites that can bind Ag2. Binding
is consistently weakest between the Ag2 fragment and the
sp3 N atoms of the amino groups in cytosine, adenine, and
guanine, and it is consistently the strongest to the sp2 N atoms. These results imply the following trend for the relative
binding strengths of the different Ag2 binding sites within
a given nucleobase: sp2 N > sp2 O ≫
sp3 N. The computed electronic binding energies also reveal
that
cytosine binds Ag2 more strongly than the other nucleobases
by at least 2.0 kcal mol–1, whereas thymine and
uracil bind it more weakly than the others by at least 3.8 kcal mol–1, which leads to the following relative binding strengths:
cytosine > adenine ≈ guanine ≫ thymine ≈ uracil.

Perturbations to the Raman spectra of the nucleobases from Ag2 binding were also examined. When Ag2 binds to
the O or N atom of the nucleobases, certain vibrational modes shift
to higher energy (blue shift) by up to +34 cm–1,
whereas others shift to lower energy (red shift) by as much as −76
cm–1. The Raman scattering activities of many modes
also increase appreciably when certain complexes form, but the enhancement
is less than 2 orders of magnitude suggesting the simple Ag2 unit is not large enough to completely capture that effect of the
SERS substrate. Nevertheless, the results presented here suggest that
these differences could be used to discriminate between particular
binding motifs between the nucleobases and silver. Direct comparison
to experiment, however, will require consideration of various environmental
effects, such as the solvent and other solute particles.
