Luminescent
semiconducting oligomers (LSOs) have been one of the
most popular molecular materials that can be applied in various fields
because of their distinctive optical properties. The study of molecular
packing and morphological change of oligomers is essential for the
rational design of materials and regulation functions. Herein, we
report two novel LSOs (OFBB and OFBT) with a slight difference in
chemical structures but show a distinct difference in self-assembly
behaviors in the coordination-driven process. OFBB forms spherical
particles with Zn(II). Compared with OFBB, OFBT has an additional
thiazole moiety, which forms spherical particles with Zn(II) and then
transforms to a crystalline nanobelt in 2 h. The process and mechanism
of the nanosphere and nanobelt formation were investigated in detail.
The double S···N interaction between two benzothiazoles
in adjacent oligomers played a significant contribution in this dynamic
morphology transformation. In addition, the as-prepared two products
showed excellent sensing toward nitrobenzene with good selectivity
over other nitro-aromatic explosives.

Introduction
In recent years, the
functionalized organic luminescent polymers
and oligomers, especially luminescent semiconducting oligomers (LSOs)
have drawn increasing attention as they have presented great potentials
in opto-electronics.1−4 These kinds of evolving materials always have known chemical structures
and modifiable molecular units, they can be modified by a variety
of methods depending on the demand for functions. The modified oligomers
can significantly improve the performance of various applications,
many researchers introduce functional groups or special atoms which
could stimulate the response to modify the functionalized oligomers,
thus widening the application filed.5−7 For example, some of
the modified oligomers were introduced to the luminescent or halogen-containing
functional groups and applied in light-harvesting, organic field effect
transistors, and sensors.8−13

The arrangement of these oligomers and intermolecular interactions
have critical influences on the morphology and final functions. The
interactions employed in oligomer assembly also present diversely,
such as hydrogen bond, metal coordination, and other weak interactions.14−16 Coordination-driven self-assembly has great advantages as its force
strength is between van der Waals force and covalent bonds, and coordination
mode is also diverse which could realize some dynamic changes.17 The different coordination numbers and geometries of central metal cations
lead to diverse packing models.18 Many
excellent works have reported the morphological change of the coordination
polymers and oligomers can be induced by the pH and concentration
of reactants, which indicated that the morphology could be finely
regulated by controlling the coordination and the weak interactions
during the assembly process.19−22 Great efforts had been made on the preparation of
dimers, oligomers, and even polymers by the synergies between the
coordination and subtle interactions, and numerous stimuli-response
structures or dynamically transformed structures were developed and
applied in various fields.23−25

Our previous work revealed
that the modification of ligands with
long-alkyl chains can significantly improve the colloidal stability
of coordination polymers. By proper selection of metal ions, nanowires,
nanospheres, and nanodisks could be facilely prepared, which were
applied in light harvesting and sensors.2,5,13 In this work, we focus on the coordination-directed
assembly and investigate how weak interactions affect the self-assembly
behavior. We introduced two novel fluorescent ligands OFBB and OFBT
bearing two carboxylic acid groups (Scheme 1a,b), which can coordinate with metal ions
to form polymeric products. In our previous study, Zn(II) with a relatively
low coordination number could induce a one-dimensional (1D) structure.26 Here, we introduced a benzothiazole unit into
ligand OFBT because it can form a dimeric structure via double S···N
interactions, which is expected to affect the 1D assembly. OFBB formed
blue-emitting nanospheres by coordination with zinc acetate. It is
interesting that OFBT formed green fluorescent nanospheres very quickly
and then transformed to crystalline nanobelts in 2 h. In addition,
the as-prepared two products could sense nitrobenzene (NB) with very
good selectivity over other nitro-aromatic compounds, such as picric
acid (PA) and trinitrotoluene (TNT). Compared to the majority of the
reported nitro-aromatic sensors, the as-prepared zinc-based nanospheres
and nanobelts can identify NB from its counterparts.27−30

Results
and Discussion
Synthesis and Characterization
In
this study, a general
solvent reaction was introduced to prepare Zn-OFBB and Zn-OFBT simultaneously,
we preset different assembly times. The morphologies of the two studied
MOFs presented are obviously different.

Generally, Zn-OFBB samples
presented spherical shapes. The mixed solution turned out to be muddy
during the process of titration, and then a partial sample was taken
out after titration was completed. When the assembly time was 1 min,
the Zn-OFBB sample presented a glued ball with a diameter of approximately
200 nm (shown in Figure 1a), there was an umbilical substance connecting one ball to another.
As the assembly time increased, the nanospheres became more independent
and the diameter gradually becomes larger (as shown in Figure 1b,c). Especially, when the
assembly time increased to 60 min, the diameter of the spheres grew
to about 300 nm (as shown in Figure 1d), at this time, the particle size of the sample is
not particularly uniform. When the reaction time increased to 120
min, the sample appeared more independent and more uniform in particle
size (as shown in Figure 1e). The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image revealed
the nanospheres were solid (as shown in Figure 1f).

Figure 1 SEM and TEM images of different assembly times
of Zn-OFBB samples:
1 (a), 5 (b), 30 (c), 60 (d), 120 min (e), and TEM image (f).

Meanwhile, the assembly of Zn-OFBT was also conducted.
Likewise,
we also preset different reaction times. Similar to above, the solution
turned cloudy during the titration process, and the morphology of
the samples appeared to be greatly different from Zn-OFBB. When setting
the reaction time as 1 and 5 min, the samples both presented spherical
shape like Zn-OFBB (shown in Figure 2a,b), interestingly, as the assembly time increased
to 30 min, there was a belt-like substance appeared rarely (as shown
in Figure 2c). In addition,
with the assembly time continually increased, there were more and
more belts in the samples, and the number of spherical particles become
less and less (as shown in Figure 2d), simultaneously, the size and the thickness of the
belts became bigger. Until the assembly time increased to 120 min,
the sample showed absolutely belts and almost no spheres were left
(as shown in Figure 2e). The TEM image showed excellent light transmission (as shown in Figure 2f). It is really
interesting that the two ligands have similar chemical structures
but can form distinct morphologies upon coordination with the same
metal ion.

Figure 2 SEM images of different assembly times of Zn-OFBT samples: 1 min
(a) (inset is magnification of certain area), 5 (b), 30 (c), 60 (d),
120 min (e), and TEM images of Zn-OFBT (f).

X-ray diffraction (XRD) was conducted to further investigate the
assembled products. The XRD patterns shown in Figure 3a revealed that the spherical products (both
Zn-OFBB and Zn-OFBT) were amorphous. It is noted that the nanobelt
showed several distinct diffraction peaks indicative of high crystallinity.
These results also implied that the precipitation caused by the rapid
reaction of zinc and carboxyl groups cannot crystallize the sample,
and slow growth can largely strength the crystallinity.31,32

XRD pattern of Zn-OFBB and Zn-OFBT samples collected at different
times; (b) FTIR spectrums of OFBB (blue), OFBT (green), Zn-OFBB (black),
and Zn-OFBT (red).

The Fourier transform
infrared spectrometer (FTIR) spectrum of
the ligands, Zn-OFBB and Zn-OFBT were collected to investigate the
coordination mode of the carboxylic acid group (as shown in Figure 3b), as carboxylate
has different coordination modes, which will make a difference in
the corresponding spectrum.18 The FTIR
spectrums of Zn-OFBB and Zn-OFBT samples revealed two dominant peaks
located at around 1609 and 1406 cm–1 with Δ
> 200 cm–1 (νas – νs = 203 cm–1). This indicated that the carboxylate
ligands adopt a monodentate coordination mode in both Zn-OFBB and
Zn-OFBT.18,26

Self-Assembly and Mechanism Study
The structure of
OFBT was similar to OFBB besides the central benzene ring being replaced
by a 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole. Two carboxyl groups OFBB and OFBT can
react rapidly with Zn(II) to form 1D polymeric chains (as shown in Scheme 2a) via the strong
metal–ligand interactions. Each Zn(II) was coordinated with
two carboxyl groups from two ligands, and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) molecules were also attached to
Zn(II) to saturate the coordination of the Zn atom (as shown in Scheme 2d). Because of the
low solubility of these long chains, they folded and aggregated to
form nanospheres (as shown in Scheme 2b). With the time increase, the spheres became slight
bigger followed by keeping stable (as shown in Scheme 2c).

Modes and Growth Processes
and Mechanisms of Zn-OFBB and Zn-OFBT: (a) 1D Zn-OFBB Polymeric Chain,
(b) Zn-OFBB Nanospheres at 1 min, (c) Zn-OFBB at 120 min, (d) Coordination

(f), Zn-OFBT Nanospheres at 1 min, and (g) Zn-OFBT Nanobelts at 120
min (the Enlarged Area Showed the “2S–2N” Interaction)
Meanwhile, for the assembly of Zn-OFBT, the
Zn(II) coordinate with
carboxyl groups in the same way as Zn-OFBB initially (as shown in Scheme 2e), which led to
the spherical product of Zn-OFBT at the beginning (as shown in Scheme 2f). In addition,
as time increased, the sulfur and nitrogen atoms on 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole
began to work, two thiadiazol groups from the two nearby ligands attracted
each other to form “2N–2S” squares (as shown
in Scheme 2g, the enlarged
area) due to the complicated forces.33 The
“2N–2S” square interactions in benzothiadiazole
not only pulled several rigid long chains and regular tetrahedral
units growing along the same direction, but also connect several chains
assembled into belt-like shapes (as shown in Scheme 2g), which is more stable than the random
packing in amorphous spheres.

To further verify the double S···N
interactions,
another comparison experiment was conducted by the addition of palladium
nitrate. It is well known that the palladium ion has high affinity
to sulfur, which is expected to interfere with the weak S···N
interactions and thus affect the self-assembly process. After the
addition of Zn(OAc)2 into a solution of OFBT, we added
a solution of palladium nitrate after 1 min. After 2 h, we collected
the precipitate and washed by the above mentioned mixed solution 3
times. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) data showed that there was
no nanobelt, but only spherical particles formed (as shown in Figure S1). Because Pd(II) had a strong affinity
toward sulfur atoms,34−36 it occupied coordination sites of the sulfur atom
rapidly, which results in the sulfur atom not being able to form “2N–2S”
squares with nitrogen atoms, thus leading to the samples presented
spherical shape. The verification experiment strongly demonstrated
the view that the form of Zn-OFBT belts is wholly because of “2S–2N”
square interactions.

Luminescent Properties and Sensing of Nitroaromatic
Explosives
The fluorescence properties of OFBB, OFBT, Zn-OFBB,
and Zn-OFBT
were investigated at room temperature. As was depicted in Figure 4a, for the OFBB and
Zn-OFBB, the luminescent spectrum exhibits characteristic emission
peaks at 416 nm with a shoulder at about 432 nm, which was attributed
to the two fluorenes located on the symmetrical sides of the central
benzene ring.37,38 Meanwhile, for the OFBT and Zn-OFBT,
both had strong peaks at about 532 nm. In the OFBT ligand, the two
fluorene functional groups acted as an electron donor and the central
benzothiadiazole group performed as an acceptor, the transfer of electrons
from the donor to the acceptor resulted in a decrease in luminescence
energy and a longer wavelength. Interestingly, Zn(II) did not change
the characteristic peak on the spectrum of the ligand after the assembly
process.

(b) quenching efficiency of Zn-OFBB and Zn-OFBT dispersed in water
with the addition of different nitro-aromatic explosives at the same
concentration; (c) detect performance of Zn-OFBB toward NB; (d) detect
performance of Zn-OFBT toward NB.

To investigate the potential recognition performances of Zn-OFBB
and Zn-OFBT in sensing nitro-aromatic explosives, the fully ground
products were dispersed in ethanol, subjected to ultrasonic treatment
for 10 min, and then tested the quenching properties of these two
oligomers by various nitro-aromatic explosives. NB, 2,4-dinitrotoluene
(DNT), 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), and 2,4,6-trinitrophenol
(PA) were dissolved in mixed water at different concentrations.

First, we tested the selectivity of the two luminescent coordination
polymers. In this regard, the response of the fluorescence of Zn-OFBB
and Zn-OFBT toward the mentioned 5 nitroaromatic explosives was evaluated
(as shown in Figure 4b). From these compounds emerged a varied degree of quenching efficiencies
on the luminescent intensity. Among the various compounds, only NB
committed high quenching efficiency toward Zn-OFBB and Zn-OFBT, which
reached 94.04 and 62.93%, respectively. In addition for the others,
the quenching efficiencies appeared relatively low, especially Zn-OFBB
toward DNT and TNT, which presented almost no annihilation effect.
According to this feature, we can effectively distinguish NB from
various nitro-aromatic explosives, and this feature was quite different
from most of the nitro-aromatic probes that have been reported.

Consecutively, we also conducted batch experiments to investigate
the performance of the two as-prepared products on NB. As was shown
in Figure 4c, the NB
solution can quench Zn-OFBB to almost no obvious peaks compared to
the blank Zn-OFBB emission when the NB concentration was 1.25 ×
10–5 mol/L, and the quenching efficiency can up
to 94.04%. For the Zn-OFBT emission (as shown in Figure 4d), the NB solution also can
weaken the fluorescence intensity. Subsequently, we calculated the
fluorescence intensities at different NB concentrations by means of
integration, fitting the correlation between the two values, and calculated
the detect limitations. The results demonstrated that Zn-OFBB was
more sensitive than Zn-OFBT toward NB, and the detect limitations
can reach to 1.1 × 10–6 and 1.6 × 10–6 mol/L, respectively.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, we have demonstrated an interesting coordination-driven
self-assembly process in which two similar fluorescent oligomers showed
distinct assembly behaviors. Oligomer OFBT bearing benzothiazole groups
form a spherical product, which then transformed to a crystalline
nanobelt in 2 h. The mechanism study revealed that the double S···N
interactions played a vital role in the dynamic morphology transformation.
Their special luminescent function and stable chemical properties
strongly supported their further application in NB detection and showed
the detect limitations were 1.1 × 10–6 and
1.6 × 10–6 mol/L, respectively. In addition,
they can also effectively distinguish the NB from other nitro-aromatic
explosives. This work provided a possibility to regulate the morphology
of oligomers and polymers by designing the structure of the ligand.

Experimental
Section
Chemicals
As an additional note, all the agents were
used as received without any further purification. Zinc acetate dihydride
was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, USA). DMF, methanol,
ethanol, and tetrahydrofuran were also used as solvents in this experiment,
which were purchased from Anaqua Global International Inc. Limited,
(USA). Palladium nitrate (Pd(NO3)2), NB, DNT,
DNP, 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) standard solution, and 2,4,6-trinitrophenol
(PA) were purchased from Macklin Reagent (Shanghai, China). Oligomers
OFBB and OFBT were synthesized by the method reported in our recent
work.39

Synthesis of Zn-OFBB and
Zn-OFBT
A solution of Zn(OAc)2 in DMF (1 mL, 1
× 10–3 mol/L) was
added into the solution of OFBB in DMF (1 mL, 1 × 10–3 mol/L) dropwise under stirring. The precipitates were collected
at different preset times (1, 5, 10, 30, 60, and 120 min) for characterization.
The whole assembly process was under ambient conditions. The collected
samples were centrifuged at a speed of 8000 rpm for 10 min and washed
by the mixed solution (ethanol/DMF = 1:1) three times. Zn-OFBT was
synthesized by the same method as Zn-OFBB but OFBT was used instead
of OFBB.

Characterizations
A polycrystalline diffractometer
(Rigaku D/max-2550 VB) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154
nm) was employed to measure the powder XRD of the prepared samples.
The morphology was characterized by a field emission SEM (Zeiss Merlin).
TEM images were observed by a Tecnai F30 electron microscope with
an acceleration voltage of 300 kV. FTIR were recorded on Nicolet iS50
spectrometers with KBr pellets. The luminescent properties and sensing
performance were measured by a HORIBA iHR320 fluorescence spectrometer.

Experiments of Aromatic Explosives Sensing
First, batch
experiments were conducted to test the selectivity of Zn-OFBB and
Zn-OFBT. The as-prepared Zn-OFBB and Zn-OFBT were dispersed in ethanol
with a concentration at 1000 ppm. Then, the two suspensions were ultrasonicated
for 10 s to make sure the particles dispersed homogeneously in the
solution. 5 μL of Zn-OFBB and Zn-OFBT was evenly dispersed in
4 mL of mixed solution (ethanol/water = 1:1) and 50 μL of 1
mmol/L nitro-aromatic explosives (NB, DNT, DNP, TNT, PA) that dissolved
in mixed solution (ethanol/water = 1:1). After shaking for 1 min,
measure the fluorescence intensities of the samples.

Further,
we investigated the sensing performance of Zn-OFBB and Zn-OFBT toward
NB by the same method, but different volumes of 1 mmol/L NB were used
instead of solutions of various nitro aromatic explosives. We set
the volumes of NB from 0 to 50 μL, and 5 μL as an interval.
After that, ethanol was added in every bottle till the total volume
of the liquid reached 4.100 mL, after reacting for 15 min, the fluorescence
spectrums of the samples were collected.
