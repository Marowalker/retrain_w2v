Two types of out-of-substrate
Ag–Ag2O nanoplates
were grown on a ZnO substrate through a surfactantless photochemical
method. First, the in situ photochemically synthesized Ag–Ag2O nanoparticles further crystallized into nanoplate-like superstructures
with rough surfaces and ragged edges. The nanoparticle-mediated crystallization
process was governed by a layer-by-layer crystallization mechanism.
Our study should help fundamentally understand the formation mechanism
of hierarchical nanoparticle superstructures. Under continuous UV
illumination, the hundreds of nanometer-sized rough nanoplates (i.e.,
the nanoplate-like superstructures of nanoparticles) can be transformed
into large smooth nanoplates with sizes of up to several micrometers.
The out-of-substrate Ag–Ag2O nanoplates/ZnO heterostructures
are potentially promising for photocatalytic applications.

1 Introduction
Two-dimensional
(2D) nanoplates are an important class of nanomaterials
with large surface areas and structural anisotropy.1,2 The
large surface areas of nanoplates are beneficial for promising applications,
ranging from catalysis to surface-enhanced spectroscopy. Their structural
anisotropy often invokes new and unusual chemical and physical properties.
Plasmonic nanoplates at subwavelength sizes strongly interact with
incident light due to the localized surface plasmon resonances. Their
unrivaled plasmonic properties together with their structural anisotropy
make Ag nanoplates a promising catalyst3−5 and excellent substrates
for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy.6−9 To date, a number of synthetic approaches
have been developed for the synthesis of Ag nanoplates, with the aim
of deliberately tailoring the anisotropic structure and thus tuning
the plasmonic properties of Ag nanoplates.10−12 In general,
the growth of Ag nanoplates is a seed-mediated solution-phase process
in which surfactants are necessary to assist anisotropic growth of
the nanoparticle seeds into nanoplate products.13−15 However, the
dense layer of surfactant molecules assembled on the nanoplate surfaces
can be deleterious for practical applications. For instance, it was
reported that the refractive index sensitivity of Ag nanotriangle
arrays drop by 20% due to the presence of an alkanethiol layer.16 In comparison with the intensively studied Ag
nanoplates, reports on Ag–Ag2O nanoplates are extremely
rare. One of the reasons might be the instability of Ag2O under light irradiation. Nevertheless, the interest in Ag2O has greatly increased recently. Ag2O has been found
to be a self-stable, efficient visible-light photocatalyst.17 As a p-type semiconductor with a narrow bandgap
(∼1.3 eV), Ag2O can be used as photosensitizer to
tune the light response of wide-bandgap semiconductors from the UV
region to the visible region.18,19 Besides, it can form
p–n heterojunctions with n-type semiconductors, ensuring more
effective interface transfer of the photogenerated charge carriers
and enhancing the photocatalytic efficiency.20−22

It is
generally accepted that under specific conditions colloidal
nanoparticles would further crystallize into hierarchical superstructures
through one of the three classical crystallization modes: screw-dislocation-driven
spiral growth,23,24 layer-by-layer growth,24 and diffusion-limited dendritic growth.25,26 Understanding the delicate crystallization process of colloidal
nanoparticles is fundamentally important to gain insight into the
formation mechanisms of their hierarchical superstructures. Most of
the reported studies were conducted in a concentrated solution of
presynthesized colloidal nanoparticles. The consequent superstructures
were mainly a result of self-assembly processes driven by interparticle
interactions,27−29 solvent evaporation,30,31 and/or external
field.32,33 The crystallization behaviors of in situ
synthesized nanoparticles have barely been reported. Directed regulation
and control over the crystallization behaviors of colloidal nanoparticles
is lacking.

We have recently reported that in situ photochemically
synthesized
nanoparticles can act as elementary structural units for further crystallization.23 When the supersaturation is relatively low,
the in situ synthesized nanoparticles further crystallize into multiple-growth-hillock-like
superstructures via a screw-dislocation-driven crystallization mechanism.
Herein, we extended our study to the crystallization of in situ synthesized
nanoparticles under a high supersaturation level. It was discovered
that increasing the nanoparticle supersaturation would switch the
crystallization mode from the screw-dislocation-dominant one to the
layer-by-layer one. As a result, the hierarchical nanoparticle superstructures
changed from multiple-growth-hillock-like ones to nanoplate-like ones.
Our study has demonstrated
that managing the supersaturation level can help achieve precise control
over the crystallization process of in situ synthesized nanoparticles
and in fine tuning the superstructure morphologies. It should shed
light on the fundamental understanding of nanoparticle-mediated crystallization
processes and help in the rational design of the hierarchical nanoparticle
superstructures to advance their applications.

This article
also reports that under continuous UV illumination,
the hundreds of nanometer-sized rough nanoplates (i.e., the nanoplate-like
superstructures of nanoparticles) would be transformed into large
smooth nanoplates with sizes of up to several micrometers. The former
have rough surfaces and ragged edges, whereas the latter have smooth
surfaces, straight edges, and a unique multilayered structure. During
structural transformation, the small rough nanoplates were first fragmented
into tiny clusters. These tiny clusters then recrystallized into large
smooth nanoplates. Both the small and large nanoplates are Ag–Ag2O composites. The relatively stable Ag–Ag2O composition may be contributed by the balance between the oxidation
of surfactantless Ag and the decomposition of Ag2O under
UV illumination.34,35 The integration of the metal/semiconductor
hybrid structure and the p–n junction of the Ag–Ag2O nanoplates/ZnO heterostructures is potentially promising
for photocatalytic applications. The
substrate-supported nature and out-of-substrate orientation of the
Ag–Ag2O nanoplates are particularly favorable for
their recycled usage in catalytic reactions.

2 Experimental
Section
2.1 Chemicals and Synthesis
Silver nitrate,
AgNO3 (≥99.8%, AR), was obtained from Shanghai Lingfeng
Chemical Reagent Co. Zinc nitrate hexahydrate, Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (≥99.0%, AR), was purchased from
Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ethanol (≥99.7%, AR) was purchased
from Jiangsu Qiangsheng Function Chemical Co. All of the reagents
were used as received, without further purification. The deionized
water was purified using the Laboratory Water Purification System
(Shanghai Hitech Instruments Co. Ltd., China).

For photochemical synthesis,
a ZnO film covered by aliquots of an aqueous solution of AgNO3 containing 20% ethanol was illuminated with a UV lamp (wavelength:
365 nm): AgNO3 was used as the precursor of Ag and ethanol
as the hole scavenger. The ZnO film was prepared using the method
reported by us before.23 Unless otherwise
specified, all synthesis reactions were carried out in a concentrated
(3–8 M) AgNO3 aqueous solution. Ag–Ag2O nanoplates with different morphologies and sizes were obtained
by adjusting the UV illumination time. An obvious color change of
the ZnO film from white to dark gray was observed at the end of UV
illumination.

2.2 Characterizations
Morphological and
structural information on the as-synthesized Ag–Ag2O nanoplates was collected using field-emission scanning electron
microscopy (SEM; Hitachi S-4700, operated at 15 kV under high vacuum)
and transmission electron microscopy (TEM; FEI, Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN,
operated at 200 kV). Crystallographic and compositional information
was obtained using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD; PANalytical X’Pert-Pro
MPD, operated at 40 kV and 40 mA) with monochromatic Cu Kα radiation
(λ = 1.54 Å) and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED,
integrated in TEM).

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Small Rough Nanoplates
For photochemical
synthesis, a ZnO film covered by aliquots of an aqueous solution of
AgNO3 was illuminated with a UV lamp (wavelength: 365 nm).
We have recently reported that short-time (less than 10 min) UV illumination
would yield multiple-growth-hillock-like superstructures of nanoparticles
on ZnO.23 The nanoparticle-mediated crystallization
process was governed by screw dislocations under relatively low supersaturation.
Note that the volume of the reaction solution is only about 100–200
μL. Solvent evaporation would shrink the solution volume and
remarkably affect the supersaturation level in the reaction solution,
especially in the case of long-time photochemical reactions. Herein,
we extended the UV illumination and studied the nanoparticle-mediated
crystallization process under a high supersaturation level. It was
discovered that under continuous UV illumination, the photochemical
products gradually switched from multiple-growth-hillock-like superstructures
into small nanoplates. At the very beginning, the newly synthesized
small nanoplates coexisted with the initial multiple-growth-hillock-like
superstructures (Figure 1A). Continuous UV illumination yielded more and more small nanoplates
with slightly increased sizes, whereas less multiple-growth-hillock
superstructures were formed in this case (Figure 1B). The small nanoplates obtained at 30 min
have a mean size of about 450 nm, with a narrowly distributed thickness
of 23 ± 5 nm (Figure 1C). The high-resolution SEM image discloses that the small
nanoplates are constructed from assemblies of nanoparticles, with
rough surfaces and ragged edges (Figure 1C). These small rough nanoplates are indeed
hierarchical superstructures of nanoparticles. Parallel syntheses
have been carried out under both dark condition and indoor daylight
condition with other conditions be the necessary of UV illumination
for the growth of small rough nanoplates on ZnO.

pattern of the small nanoplates obtained at 30 min. Concentration
of AgNO3 precursor: 5 M.

The constituent nanoparticles of the nanoplate-like superstructures
are synthesized from the photoreduction of Ag+ ions. The
detailed photochemical mechanism can be understood as follows: under
UV illumination, excitons (i.e., electron–hole pairs) are generated
in ZnO upon the absorption of photons (eq 1). The photogenerated electrons and holes
separate from each other and migrate to the ZnO surface. On the ZnO
surface, the photogenerated electrons are captured by the adsorbed
Ag+ ions (eq 2) because of the more positive potential of Ag+/Ag (0.799
V, vs standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) potential) compared to that
of the conduction band of ZnO (−0.31 V, vs SHE potential).
Meanwhile, the photogenerated holes are consumed by the hole scavenger,
ethanol in this case (eq 3). The photoreduced Ag atoms can nucleate into metallic Ag nuclei,
which gradually grow into Ag nanoparticles. Note that the constituent
nanoparticles are synthesized by surfactantless photochemical reactions.
The surfactantless
Ag nanoparticles are highly apt for partial oxidization under ambient
conditions. That is, the constituent nanoparticles are Ag–Ag2O composites. This has been confirmed by the XRD characterization.
As shown in Figure 1D, besides the reflections from Ag and the ZnO substrate, one can
also see prominent reflections from Ag2O. 1   2   3  Figure 2A shows a TEM image
of the small rough nanoplates. The constituent nanoparticles are also
clearly resolved in the TEM image. The SAED pattern reveals the polycrystalline
nature of the small rough nanoplates (Figure 2B). The multiple diffraction spots can be
ascribed to the dual lattices from both Ag and Ag2O. High-resolution
TEM (HRTEM) resolves the lattice fringes with a d-spacing of 2.35 Å, which matches the {111} reflection of face-centered
cubic (fcc) silver (Figure 2C). The lattice fringes with a measured d-spacing of 2.70 Å agree with the {111} reflection of primitive
cubic Ag2O, consistent with the XRD characterization shown
in Figure 1D.

Increasing experimental evidence
has suggested that under specific
conditions colloidal nanoparticles would act as elementary structural
units and further crystallize into hierarchical superstructures through
one of the three classical crystallization modes: screw-dislocation-driven
spiral growth,23,24 layer-by-layer growth,24 or diffusion-limited dendritic growth.25,26 Chen et al.24 reported the real-time
observation of crystallization of presynthesized colloidal gold nanorods.
It was found that the nanorods crystallized into spiral superlattices
when the supersaturation was relatively low. At a higher supersaturation,
the crystallization changed to a layer-by-layer crystal growth process
and led to the formation of 2D lamellar superlattices. In our case,
the volume of the reaction solution is only about 100–200 μL.
The effective photochemical reactions will give a burst of nanoparticles
in the reaction solution. The nanoparticle concentration increases
rapidly to the critical supersaturation level in a short time. At
the very beginning, when the nanoparticle supersaturation is relatively
low, the in situ photochemically synthesized nanoparticles further
crystallize into multiple-growth-hillock-like superstructures through
the screw-dislocation-driven crystallization mechanism (Figure 3A). The effective photochemical
reactions together with continuous solvent evaporation would further
increase the nanoparticle supersaturation. As a consequence, the nanoparticle-mediated
crystallization mode switches from the screw-dislocation-dominant
one to the layer-by-layer one. The 2D nanoplate-like superstructures
are a result of the layer-by-layer crystallization of the in situ
synthesized nanoparticles (Figure 3B).

Figure 3 Schematic mechanistic diagrams illustrating that (A) the
in situ
synthesized nanoparticles further crystallize into multiple-growth-hillock-like
superstructures via the screw-dislocation-driven crystallization mechanism
and (B) the in situ synthesized nanoparticles further crystallize
into nanoplate-like hierarchical superstructures via the layer-by-layer
crystallization mechanism. For clear illustration, the objects in
the schematic model are not shown in the same scale.

We have carried out parallel photochemical syntheses
in both concentrated
(3−8 M) and dilute (0.1−0.3 M) AgNO3 solutions.
It was discovered that short-time UV illumination (10–30 min)
could produce nanoplate-like superstructures from concentrated AgNO3 solution. By contrast, growth of nanoplate-like superstructures
from dilute AgNO3 solution occurred only after long-time
(≥120 min) UV illumination (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). This can be understood from the
fact that reaching the same supersaturation level in dilute AgNO3 solution would take a longer time than that in concentrated
AgNO3 solution under identical experimental conditions.
The parallel photochemical syntheses in both concentrated (3−8
M) and diluted (0.1−0.3 M) AgNO3 solutions confirm
from the side that the small rough nanoplates are grown from the layer-by-layer
crystallization of nanoparticles. Sun et al. also reported the growth
of Ag rough nanoplates on n-GaAs.36 They
also noticed that the Ag rough nanoplates were constructed from assemblies
of grains. The growth of Ag rough nanoplates was ascribed to the low
concentration of AgNO3 (<0.3 M), which could not support
the anisotropic growth of Ag nanoplates with continuous lattices.36 We believe that nanoparticle-mediated layer-by-layer
crystallization is the fundamental mechanism responsible for the growth
of rough nanoplates.

3.2 Large Smooth Nanoplates
As a part
of this investigation, we have also discovered that extended UV illumination
would induce structural evolution from hundreds of nanometer-sized
rough nanoplates to smooth nanoplates with sizes of up to several
micrometers. Figure 4 shows the large nanoplates obtained after UV illumination for 180
min. These large nanoplates exhibit characteristic smooth surfaces,
straight edges, and sharp tips. Adjacent large nanoplates with the
same crystalline orientations tend to stack up together against their
basal surfaces. Eventually, these nanoplates fuse into thicker ones,
a process similar to polymerization. Polymerization of the nanoplates
can greatly reduce the surface energy and thus stabilize the ultrathin
large nanoplates. It is particularly interesting to observe the vivid
in-progress polymerization of nanoplates. As indicated by the arrow
in Figure 4B, a portion
of the nanoplate is “polymerized” with the adjacent
nanoplates; the rest was upwarped, as another cross-linking nanoplate
“blocked” the polymerization process. Figure 4C gives a schematic illustration
of the nanoplate polymerization. More SEM characterizations of the
nanoplate polymerization can be found in Figure S2. The polymerization process and its inhomogeneous nature
lead to the unique multilayered structure and widely distributed thickness
of large nanoplates. One can catch glimpses of the unique multilayered
structure in the close-up side view (Figure 4D, indicated by the white semitransparent
circles). The widely distributed thickness, measured from the close-up
side view of the vertically oriented nanoplates, is in the range of
19–347 nm, with an average value of 108 nm (Figure S3). Figure 4E plots the XRD pattern of the large smooth nanoplates obtained
at 180 min. Besides the reflections from the ZnO substrate, we observed
reflections from both Ag and Ag2O. The XRD results again
suggest partial oxidation of surfactantless Ag under ambient conditions.
However, we did not observe complete oxidation of Ag into Ag2O even after long-time UV illumination. We speculate that whereas
Ag is oxidized into Ag2O the unstable Ag2O is
decomposed back into Ag under UV illumination.17 The Ag–Ag2O nanoplates are self-stable
composites because of the balance between oxidation of surfactantless
Ag and decomposition of Ag2O under UV illumination.34,35

nanoplates, highlighted by white semitransparent circles. (E) XRD
characterization of the large smooth nanoplates. UV illumination time:
180 min. Concentration of AgNO3 precursor: 5 M.

Besides polymerization, the thickness of the large
nanoplates also
depends on the concentration of the AgNO3 precursor. When
the synthesis conditions
are kept the same but the AgNO3 concentration is decreased
from 5 to 1 M, large nanoplates with similar sizes also grow on ZnO
films (Figure 5). However,
a close-up view discloses that these large nanoplates are thinner
than those grown from 5 M AgNO3 (Figure 5C,D). The thickness measured from the close-up
side view of the vertically oriented nanoplates is in the range of
11–236 nm, with an average value of 86 nm (Figure S4).

High-magnification SEM images showing the widely distributed thicknesses
of large nanoplates, which on average are thinner than those prepared
from a 5 M AgNO3 aqueous solution (please refer to Figure 4).

We have also discovered that the morphology of
the ZnO substrate
can affect the orientation of the large nanoplates. Figure 6A,B shows spokewise ZnO strips
and nanoplate arrays grown on the spokewise ZnO strips, respectively.
These nanoplates take preferential orientation along the ZnO strips,
as can be seen clearly in the close-up view (Figure 6C,D). It is not surprising to observe more
prominent polymerization of large nanoplates in this case, as indicated
by the arrows in Figure 6D.

nanoplate arrays grown on the spokewise ZnO strips. (C–D) Close-up
view of the large nanoplate arrays, revealing the preferential orientation
of the large nanoplates. Concentration of AgNO3 precursor:
1 M.

Figure 7 shows typical
TEM images of the large smooth nanoplates. The small black dots sparsely
dispersed across the entire sample are tiny clusters from the fragmented
small rough nanoplates (see Figure 7 and the discussion below). Each individual nanoplate
has one edge, which is much rougher than the other edges (Figure 7B,C, indicated by
the arrows). It is this rough edge that is in contact with the rough
ZnO substrate. On carefully checking the nanoplate edges, one can
see clearly the unique multilayered structure. Figure 7D shows the SAED pattern obtained by focusing
the electron beam perpendicular to the basal surfaces of an individual
nanoplate. The strong diffraction spots arranged in hexagonal patterns
indicate that the large nanoplates are crystallized in an fcc lattice
with (111) basal surfaces. The outer set of diffraction spots can
be assigned to the allowed {422} lattice fringes, with a measured d-spacing of 0.83 Å. The middle set corresponds to
lattice fringes with a measured d-spacing of 1.44
Å and can be indexed to the {220} reflection of fcc silver. The
inner set can be ascribed to the forbidden 1/3{422} reflection, with
a measured d-spacing of 2.49 Å. The clear observation
of the forbidden 1/3{422} reflection reveals the stacking faults of
the (111) twin planes parallel to the basal surfaces. It was suggested
that the presence of (111) stacking faults is key to the formation
of the platelike morphology.37 Besides,
the SAED pattern has also resolved the {111}, {211}, and {220} reflections
of Ag2O (primitive cubic phase), with measured d-spacings of 2.75, 1.94, and 1.68 Å, respectively
(Figure 7D). The observed
reflections of Ag2O suggest partial oxidation of Ag, being
consistent with the XRD characterization (see Figure 4E). The Moiré fringe patterns, showing
an array of parallel lines (Figure 7E), are another manifestation of the stacking of the
(111) twin planes. The Moiré patterns arise from superimposed
crystalline lattices of the (111) twin planes with different crystalline
orientations (rotated by a certain angle), known as rotational Moiré
patterns in the literature. The HRTEM image (Figure 7F) clearly shows the lattice fringes with
a measured d-spacing of 2.49 Å, in agreement
with the 1/3{422} reflection of fcc silver resolved in the SAED pattern.
The lattice fringes with a measured d-spacing of
2.72 Å agree with the {111} reflection of primitive cubic Ag2O resolved in the SAED pattern. Superposition of the Ag (111)
lattice and the Ag2O (111) lattice is another possible
origin of the Moiré pattern.

structures: (A–C) TEM images, (D) SAED pattern, and (E–F)
HRTEM images.

To further understand
the growth mechanisms of large smooth nanoplates,
we carefully characterized the samples at various growth stages. Figure 8 shows the large
nanoplates at growth stages of 50 min (A, B), 90 min (C, D), and 180
min (E, F). These images clearly illustrate that the density of the
large nanoplates increased over the growth time. As shown in Figure 8A, a few large nanoplates
first appeared at about 50 min. The close-up view reveals that they
have smooth surfaces but are decorated with a lot of tiny clusters
(i.e., the white spots on the surface, Figure 8B). The edges are hackly but are distinct
from the ragged edges of small nanoplates (see Figure 1). The small nanoplates can still be observed
at this point. However, their mean sizes become smaller and the ragged
edges are more irregular now. At 90 min, the edges of the large nanoplates
that were initially hackly become perfectly straight. No more small
nanoplates can be recognized around the large nanoplates. Instead,
a lot of floccus can be found around the large nanoplates. By 180
min, both the size and density of the large nanoplates are fairly
increased. The smooth surfaces of the large nanoplates are pretty
clean. Hardly any floccus are observed around the large nanoplates.
On the basis of the observation described above, we speculate that
the structural evolution from small rough nanoplates to large smooth
nanoplates is governed by the photoinduction mechanism, a well-known
mechanism for the photoinduced conversion of colloidal Ag nanoparticles
into nanoprisms.1,38 Under UV illumination, the small
rough nanoplates are gradually fragmented into tiny clusters. At the
beginning of fragmentation, we observed deformation of the small nanoplates
(Figure 8B). The floccus
observed around the large nanoplates are also a result of fragmentation
of the small nanoplates (Figure 8D). The tiny clusters can further recrystallize into
large smooth nanoplates. Eventually, the small nanoplates are completely
sacrificed over the growth of large nanoplates. Figure 8G schematically illustrates the growth mechanism
of large smooth nanoplates. In the first step, the small rough nanoplates
are fragmented into tiny clusters. These tiny clusters then recrystallize
into ultrathin large smooth nanoplates (step 2). Adjacent ultrathin
large nanoplates with the same crystalline orientation stack up together
against their basal surfaces and polymerize into thick nanoplates
with multilayered structures (step 3). Polymerization of the nanoplates
can greatly reduce the surface energy and stabilize the ultrathin
large nanoplates.

Conclusions
We
have successfully grown out-of-substrate Ag–Ag2O
nanoplates on a ZnO substrate using a surfactantless photochemical
approach. Two kinds of Ag–Ag2O nanoplates, with
very different morphologies and sizes, were obtained. The first, that
is, small rough nanoplates, were hierarchical superstructures of in
situ synthesized nanoparticles. The nanoparticle-mediated crystallization
process can be understood by the layer-by-layer crystallization mechanism.
Under continuous UV illumination, the hundreds of nanometer-sized
rough nanoplates are transformed into large smooth nanoplates with
sizes of up to several micrometers. During structural transformation,
the small rough nanoplates were first fragmented into tiny clusters.
The clusters then recrystallized into micrometer-sized nanoplates
with smooth surfaces, straight edges, and a unique multilayered structure.
This work has explored, in depth, the surfactantless photochemical
synthesis of out-of-substrate Ag–Ag2O nanoplates
on the semiconductive ZnO substrate. Our study has demonstrated that
it is possible to direct the delicate crystallization process of nanoparticles
by carefully controlling the nanoparticle supersaturation. It should
shed light on the fundamental understanding of nanoparticle-mediated
crystallization processes and help in the rational design of hierarchical
nanoparticle superstructures to advance their applications. The Ag–Ag2O nanoplates/ZnO heterostructures are promising for applications
in chemical sensing and photocatalytic reactions. The
substrate-supported nature and out-of-substrate orientation of Ag–Ag2O nanoplates are particularly favorable for thier recycled
usage in catalytic reactions.
