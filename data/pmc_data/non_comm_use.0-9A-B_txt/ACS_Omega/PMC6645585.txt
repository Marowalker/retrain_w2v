Nanomaterials,
such as zeolites and metal–organic frameworks,
have been studied for CO2 capture and sequestration. However,
this application of nanomaterials has been limited largely due to
their poor selectivity for flue gases as well as low capture capacity
under low pressures. The first-principle density-functional theory
calculations for porphyrin-like graphene decorated with a transition
metal were performed to investigate the effects of mechanical strain
on its CO2 capture capacity. We found that Sc- and V-decorated
porphyrin-like graphenes could capture CO2 molecules selectively
from gaseous mixtures under low CO2 pressure with compressive
strain and release them with tensional strain at room temperatures.
The CO2 binding to these transition metals was understood
to be mostly due to the Dewar interaction involving hybridization
of the metal d orbitals with π orbitals of CO2. These
results elucidate a novel approach to the CO2 capture process
with the application of the mechanical strain to nanomaterials.

Introduction
Carbon dioxide has been considered to
be the main cause of climate
change. Its concentration in the earth’s atmosphere has increased
to 391 ppm in 2011, and by 2100 it is expected that the concentration
could reach about 600 ppm. Anthropogenic CO2 emission will
give rise to ocean acidification and rising sea levels due to glacial
melting. The demands for fossil fuels accelerate these trends, and
therefore the identification of new and effective carbon-capturing
materials would be an important task to mitigate the climate change.1

Among diverse studies of CO2 capture,2−16 nanostructured materials, such as zeolites and metal–organic
frameworks, have been considered candidates for CO2-capturing
substances. However, applications have been limited, despite fast
adsorption kinetics and effective regeneration of CO2,5,7,9−16 because of their poor selectivity for flue gases and low capacity
under near-ambient conditions.5,6,8 For these reasons, traditional adsorbent seems hard to apply for
CO2 capturing from flue gases.17 In response, investigation of novel CO2 capture materials
is emerging.18−21

Recently, transition-metal-porphyrin-like fragments (TM-N4) on the surface of nanostructures, analogous to the central
structure
of hemoglobin or myoglobin,22,23 were synthesized by
the chemical vapor deposition and pyrolysis methods.24−30 In this structure, a transition metal (TM) atom is surrounded by
four nitrogen atoms as in a metal-porphyrin structure.31,32 Considering that the concentration of nitrogen was found to reach
∼8% in carbon nanotubes (CNTs)33 and ∼10% in graphene,34 it is
expected that TM-porphyrin-like carbon nanostructures can be synthesized
experimentally. Using a combinatorial method of thermodynamics and
ab initio density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, some of us
investigated the most efficient TM element in graphene-based TM-N4 structure by high-throughput screening,35 from which it was concluded that TM-decorated porphyrin-like
graphene can be a good CO2-capturing material, and Sc-
and V-decorated ones provide high selectivity for CO2 capture
from flue gases.

On the other hand, recent ab initio calculations
of Kou et al.
revealed substantially enhanced adsorption of several important environmental
molecules such as NO and NH3 on a monolayer MoS2 in the presence of mechanical strain.36 The variations in the binding energies were understood to result
from changes in the charge environment due to distorted atomic structures
under mechanical strain. Since a monolayer graphene was reported to
endure from −1 to +10% of uniaxial strain37,38 and from −1 to +2% of biaxial strain,39−41 we expect that
the CO2 capacity of TM-decorated porphyrin-like graphene
could be tuned by mechanical strain, without any temperature adjustment.
Thus, we performed first-principle DFT calculations to investigate
the property of CO2 capture on TM-porphyrin-like graphene
under mechanical strain. We here consider biaxial mechanical strain
in the range of −3 to +3%, which is theoretically acceptable
even though compression is harder than stretching.

This paper
is organized as follows. The section of Flue-Gas
Models deals with the chemical potentials of different
gas molecules constituting our flue gases. The DFT results along with
the related discussions are presented in the section Results and Discussion. We summarize our findings and conclude
in the section Conclusions. Finally, computational
details, including the description of the TM-porphyrin-like graphene,
are presented in the section Computational Methods
and Details.

Flue-Gas Models
The chemical potential
of gases, μ = (H – TS)/N, where H, S, and N denote the enthalpy, the entropy,
and the number of gas molecules, respectively, was calculated from
the enthalpy and entropy data in NIST Standard Reference Data.42 Also, we considered three different compositions
of flue gas based on previous literature:10,43 (1) CO2/N2 = 89:11 (oxy-fuel), (2) CO2/H2/CH4 = 20:75:5 (precombustion), and
(3) CO2/N2 = 17:83 (postcombustion). Table 1 presents chemical
potentials of different gas molecules in our flue-gas models at a
temperature of 298 K and at a pressure of 1 bar.

Results and Discussion
Geometric
Configurations and Distance Change
Figure 1 presents optimized
geometric configurations of four different gas molecules adsorbed
on TM-porphyrin-like graphene. For this, we considered various hapticities
(e.g., η1-CO2, η2-CO2) of the adsorbed gas molecules. Among them, η2-CO2, η1-N2, η1-CH4, and η2-H2 shown in Figure 1 were selected because
they resulted in the lowest adsorption energies for the corresponding
gas molecules. These optimized geometric structures were observed
to change very little even with the change in the distance between
a TM atom and a porphyrin-like plane under mechanical strain.

Figure 1 Optimized geometric
configurations of the four gas molecules of
(a) CO2, (b) N2, (c) CH4, and (d)
H2 captured on TM-porphyrin-like graphene. The red, gray,
orange, blue, and white balls indicate oxygen, carbon, TM, nitrogen,
and hydrogen atoms, respectively.

Structural effects of the gas adsorptions are further investigated
by analyzing the gas–TM and TM–substrate distance changes
while adjusting the mechanical strain to the substrate. As seen in Figure 2, the distance between
a TM atom and the substrate increases, regardless of the type of gas
molecules, when altering from a tensional strain to a compressive
strain. However, no significant change in the gas–TM distance
is observed, except for the case of CH4 on the V-decorated
substrate where the CH4 molecule is much further away from
a V atom (3.6–5.0 Å) than the other gas molecules (1.8–2.0
Å). This indicates that under compressive mechanical strain,
a TM atom is bound less to the surrounding nitrogen atoms in porphyrin-like
graphene, and its orbitals could be more involved in the adsorption
process of a gas molecule.

a TM atom (open symbols),
and distance between a TM atom and the porphyrin-like plane (solid
symbols) as functions of the mechanical strain for (a) Sc-, (b) Ti-,
and (c) V-porphyrin-like graphene. Olive, red, yellow, and blue symbols
represent the cases of CH4, CO2, H2, and N2 captured on TM-porphyrin-like graphene, respectively.

Charge Density Differences
and Density of States
We
now analyze the changes in charge density distributions in the process
of capturing gas molecules on TM-porphyrin-like graphene. The charge
density difference is defined by Δρ = ρgas–substrate – ρsubstrate – ρgas, where ρgas–substrate, ρsubstrate, and ρgas denote the charge densities of gas-adsorbed
TM-porphyrin-like graphene complex, TM-porphyrin-like graphene alone,
and an isolated gas molecule, respectively. The results for Sc-porphyrin-like
graphene under the mechanical strain of −2% are illustrated
in Figure 3. One can
see in Figure 3a that
the domain of the largest charge depletion observed near a TM atom
accompanies the largest charge accumulation region near the bottom
side of CO2, indicating some hybridization of TM orbitals
with CO2 orbitals. The charge density difference in the
case of N2 adsorption shows that the charge accumulation
below N2 is correlated with the charge depletion proximal
to a TM atom, yet the depletion is smaller in magnitude when compared
to the CO2 case (see Figure 3b). Figure 3c shows the charge density difference for CH4 adsorption
on TM-decorated porphyrin-like graphene, displaying charge accumulation
under a methane molecule and a much smaller depletion near the TM
atom than CO2 and N2 adsorption. In Figure 3d, an adsorbed hydrogen
molecule is observed to cause charge accumulation to the direction
of the TM atom and a nearly invisible charge shortage near the TM
atom, which is understood to be due to the well-known Kubas interaction.44 Considering that the d orbitals near the TM
atom are the most active for CO2 capture when compared
to the adsorption of the other gases, we understand that the Dewar
interaction is a dominant mechanism for CO2 capture on
TM-decorated porphyrin-like graphene even under mechanical strain.

Figure 3 Charge
density differences for gas molecules of (a) CO2, (b) N2, (c) CH4, and (d) H2 captured
on Sc-porphyrin-like graphene at a compressive strain of −2%.
With the same color scale, yellow and azure regions indicate charge
accumulation and depletion, respectively. Gray, blue, orange, red,
and white dots denote carbon, nitrogen, Sc, oxygen, and hydrogen atoms,
respectively, while the gray line represents the graphene substrate.

For further analysis of the orbital
properties near a TM atom and
CO2, we present in Figure 4 the density of states for a Sc atom and a CO2 molecule in the CO2–Sc-porphyrin-like graphene
complex, where one can identify an overlap between d orbitals of Sc
and π-orbitals of CO2 near −1.6 and +1.6 eV.
This means that there exists an evident hybridization between d orbitals
of a Sc atom and π-orbitals of CO2, which accounts
for the charge density difference shown in Figure 3a. The analysis of the charge density distributions
and the density of states confirms that CO2 capture on
TM-porphyrin-like graphene takes place due to the Dewar interaction,
which was first reported in our previous study for CO2 capture
on strainless TM-porphyrin-like graphene.35

graphene under a compressive strain of −2%. Black, olive, brown,
and blue lines denote s, p, and d orbitals of Sc and π-orbital
of CO2, respectively. EF represents
the Fermi level of the complex.

CO2 Capture Capacity and Selectivity
To
examine the feasibility of controlling the CO2 capture
process with mechanical strain, we estimated the thermodynamic CO2 capture capacity. To define the capture capacity at a certain
mechanical strain of X%, we start from the grand-canonical
partition function 1  where gni denotes the degeneracy of the
configurations with ni adsorbed gas molecules of type i.4,45 While NS is the number of distinguishable
adsorption sites on the system, μi and ϵnii(X) represent the chemical potential (<0) of the i-type gas and its average adsorption energy (<0) under
the mechanical strain of X%, respectively. Because
we assume that only one molecule can be adsorbed per adsorption site,
neither mixed adsorptions of different molecules nor multiple adsorptions
of the same molecule are considered, that is, gni = 1 and ni = 1, which is a reasonable
assumption because we deal with gas molecules, including CO2, at low pressures less than 1 bar. Then, the thermally averaged
number of adsorbed i-type gas molecules at the mechanical
strain of X% can be derived from 2  Therefore,
the mean CO2 occupancy
per adsorption site can be written as 3  From this, the thermodynamic CO2 capture capacity of the
TM-porphyrin-like graphene at a certain
mechanical strain of X% for a mixed gas can be set
up as 4  where Mi and mi are an
atomic mass and the number of each element in the substrate, respectively.

Using the first-principle DFT calculations, we computed the adsorption
energy of each gas molecule captured on the substrate, which is defined
by 5  here, Ei–substrate(X) and Esubstrate(X)
correspond to the total
energies of a gas–substrate complex and a TM-porphyrin-like
graphene at the mechanical strain of X%, while Ei is the energy of an i-type gas molecule. Figure 5 shows our DFT results of the adsorption energy for
each gas molecule captured on the substrate. For all TM atoms considered
in this study, the CO2 adsorption energy is observed to
decrease steadily as the mechanical strain to the substrate changes
from a tension to a compression. This indicates that as the distance
between a decorated TM atom and the four nitrogen atoms in the graphene
sheet increases with compressive strain, its d orbitals are more activated
for hybridization with CO2 π-orbitals to result in
stronger Dewar interaction.

Figure 5 Adsorption energies of flue gases captured on
TM-porphyrin-like
graphene with three TM atoms of (a) Sc, (b) Ti, and (c) V as a function
of the mechanical strain. Olive, red, yellow, and blue symbols represent
the adsorption energies of CH4, CO2, H2, and N2, respectively.

Figure 5a
shows
the adsorption energies of different flue-gas molecules captured on
Sc-porphyrin-like graphene under mechanical strain. Like CO2, H2, CH4, and N2 molecules are
seen to have lower adsorption energies with stronger compressional
mechanical strain. We note that the adsorption energy curves of CO2 (red) and N2 (blue) have an intersection point
at the mechanical strain of +1.5%, below which the CO2 adsorption
energy is lower than the adsorption energy of N2. Figure 5b exhibits the adsorption
energies of the flue gases as a function of the mechanical strain
to the Ti-decorated substrate. This figure shows that CO2 has the lowest adsorption energy among the flue-gas molecules over
the whole range of the mechanical strain considered here. In addition,
the CO2 adsorption energy is found to vary depending on
the strength of applied mechanical strain, while those of the other
molecules do not. The adsorption energies of gases captured on V-porphyrin-like
graphene are displayed in Figure 5c, where the adsorption energy of CH4 hardly
changes but the ones of the other gas molecules decrease monotonically
with the CO2 adsorption energy showing the largest decrease,
as the mechanical strain changes from +3 to −3%. Interestingly,
CO2 is observed to have higher adsorption energies than
N2 in the whole range of the mechanical strain considered
here for V-porphyrin-like graphene. This suggests that regardless
of the magnitude of the applied mechanical strain, N2 adsorption
would be favored over CO2 adsorption on the V-porphyrin-like
graphene under our flue-gas models where the chemical potential of
CO2 is lower than that of N2 (see Table 1).

Figure 6 exhibits
our results for the CO2 capture capacity C(X, T) of TM-porphyrin-like graphenes,
which were estimated using eq 4, for the three flue-gas models as functions of the mechanical
strain to the substrate. In Figure 6a, one can see the dependence of the CO2 capture capacity of Sc-decorated porphyrin-like graphene on the
applied mechanical strain. In the oxy-fuel and precombustion compositions,
the CO2 capture capacity shows similar values of ∼2.33
and ∼2.40 mmol/g for −3–0% strain with very little
strain dependence, whereas they drastically fall to ∼0.11 and
∼0.18 mmol/g within the range of 0 to +3% strain. In the postcombustion
composition, the CO2 capture capacity follows a similar
trend, with near complete depletion at +2% strain from the value of
∼2.15 mmol/g at −2% strain. One can see in Figure 6b that Ti-decorated
porphyrin-like graphene has the CO2 capture capacity of
∼2.42 mmol/g, regardless of our flue-gas composition, for the
entire range of the mechanical strain considered here. However, the
CO2 capture capacity on V-decorated porphyrin-like graphene
is seen in Figure 6c to be definitely impacted by the flue-gas composition. The oxy-fuel
composition shows the maximum CO2 capture capacity of ∼0.61
mmol/g at −3% strain, and it gradually decreases for −3
to −0.5% strain until it reaches 0 mmol/g for −0.5 to
+3% strain. On the other hand, the precombustion model has a CO2 capture capacity of ∼2.42 mmol/g below the +0.5% strain,
beyond which it decreases abruptly and falls to ∼0 mmol/g at
+2% strain. Lastly, the postcombustion flue gas shows a fixed CO2 capture capacity of ∼0 mmol/g for the entire range
of mechanical strain. Thus, among the three different substrates,
Sc- and V-decorated porphyrin-like graphene have controllability of
CO2 capture with the mechanical strain, whereas the CO2 capture capacity of Ti-porphyrin-like graphene shows no dependence
on the mechanical strain.

Figure 6 CO2 capture capacities of TM-porphyrin-like
graphenes
decorated with three different TM atoms of (a) Sc, (b) Ti, and (c)
V as functions of the mechanical strain, which were estimated under
our three flue-gas models of oxy-fuel (black), precombustion (red),
and postcombustion (blue).

To examine the selectivity of CO2 capture from
flue
gases with our model compositions, we now consider the differences
between chemical potentials of flue gases and their adsorption energies
on a TM-porphyrin-like graphene 6  Thermodynamically, CO2 capture
is more dominant than adsorption of other gas molecules on a certain
substrate when ΔCO2(X) is larger than Δother(X). In
this regard, we set region (i) for ΔCO2 > Δother and region (ii) for ΔCO2 < Δother. Figure 7 presents our results for Δi(X) on Sc- and V-decorated porphyrin-like
graphene under the mechanical strain of X%. We here
omit the discussion of Δi(X) for the Ti-decorated substrate because the substrate
does not show controllable capability of CO2 capture with
the applied mechanical strain as seen in Figure 6. For the Sc-decorated substrate, the precombustion
system shows a region (i) of ΔCO2 >
Δother(X) for the full range of
mechanical
strain, while region (i) appears at mechanical strain below +1% for
the oxy-fuel and below −1% for the postcombustion model (see Figure 7a). For the V-decorated
substrate, the precombustion model shows region (i) below +2.5% of
the mechanical strain, whereas the oxy-fuel and the postcombustion
models manifest no region (i) for the entire range of the mechanical
strain considered here.

Figure 7 Difference between the gas chemical potential
of i-type molecule and its adsorption energy, Δi(X) = μi – ϵi(X), on (a) Sc- and (b) V-porphyrin-like graphenes for each
flue-gas
model as a function of the mechanical strain X%.
Red, yellow, olive, and blue symbols represent Δi(X) of CO2, H2, CH4, and N2 for each model composition, respectively.

Our results for C(X, T) presented in Figure 6 show that the CO2 capture capacity on Sc-
and V-decorated porphyrin-like graphenes could be controlled with
the application of mechanical strain, while the CO2 capture
on the Ti-decorated substrate could not. Because selective CO2 capture from flue gases could be realized in region (i) defined
above, the controllable CO2 capture capacity with mechanical
strain is defined by the difference between the maximum CO2 capture capacity and the minimum capacity in region (i). According
to Figure 7, the Sc-decorated
substrate shows the controllable CO2 capture capacity of
∼1.43 mmol/g for the oxy-fuel, ∼2.22 mmol/g for the
precombustion, and ∼1.25 mmol/g for the postcombustion gas
model, whereas the respective values for the V-decorated substrate
are ∼0, ∼2.42, and ∼0 mmol/g. As summarized in Table 2, the precombustion
gas system shows the maximum selective controllable CO2 capture capacity on Sc- and V-decorated porphyrin-like graphenes.
On the other hand, the oxy-fuel and the postcombustion flue-gas models
exhibit controllability of selective CO2 capture with mechanical
strain only on the Sc-decorated substrate.

a The capture capacities are in units
of mmol/g.

The above CO2 capture capacities of the TM-porphyrin-like
graphenes were obtained for flue gases under the pressure of 1 bar
at a temperature of 298 K. For all our flue-gas models, the CO2 capture capacities are found to significantly decrease when
the temperature increases to 473 K, but they show small increases
with the pressure increasing to 2 bar. The controllable CO2 capture capacities predicted for the TM-porphyrin-like graphenes
with the application of mechanical strain are only about a half of
the capture capacity of ∼4.3 mmol/g reported for N-doped porous
carbon via the chemical activation of polypyrrole/graphene composites
using potassium hydroxide solution.21 Practical
significance of our DFT results lies in the fact that they could be
achieved through the selective capture process of CO2 from
mixed flue gases without any thermodynamic combustion. First-principle
DFT calculations are known to have some limitation in estimating the
CO2 adsorption energy accurately. Especially, the generalized
gradient approximation (GGA) in the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
(PBE) scheme we used for the exchange correlation functional tends
to underestimate the adsorption energy of a molecule on a substrate
because of its inability of describing weak van der Waals interaction.46,47 This suggests that the actual CO2 capture capacities
of TM-porphyrin-like graphenes could be higher than the values reported
in this paper.

Substrate Bending Effects
As discussed
above, the distance
between a decorated TM atom and the graphene sheet increases when
a compressive mechanical strain is applied to a TM-porphyrin-like
graphene. This allows d orbitals of a TM atom to be more activated
for hybridization with CO2 π-orbitals, resulting
in the lowering of the CO2 adsorption energy due to stronger
Dewar interaction. In addition to the increase of the TM–substrate
distance, actual application of compressive strain could cause some
bending of the graphene surface. To investigate the effects of substrate
bending on the CO2 capture process, we performed additional
first-principle DFT calculations for the adsorption of flue gases
on Sc-porphyrin-like carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with various curvatures.

Figure 8 presents
the adsorption energy of each flue gas depending on the curvature
of the CNT substrate. As can be seen, the adsorption energies of CH4 and H2 change very little with the increase in
substrate bending from graphene to (8,0) CNT, where they show similar
values around −0.3 and −0.2 eV, respectively. On the
other hand, one can observe a clear trend that both CO2 and N2 adsorption energies get lower as the substrate
bends from graphene to (8,0) CNT. But they have significantly higher
values on smaller (6,0) and (4,0) CNTs than on (8,0) CNT. It is found
that the CO2 adsorption energy has the highest value of
−0.53 eV on (4,0) CNT and the lowest value of −0.94
eV on (8,0) CNT.

Figure 8 Adsorption energies of flue-gas molecules of CO2 (red),
H2 (yellow), CH4 (olive), and N2 (blue)
on Sc-decorated porphyrin-like CNTs with different curvatures. The
term (c,0) in the horizontal axis, which is scaled
by the CNT radius, represents the CNT chiral indices with completely
flat graphene corresponding to (∞,0). The degree of the CNT
substrate bending gets larger as c decreases.

Our DFT results for the flue-gas
adsorptions on Sc-porphyrin-like
CNTs have shown that the bending of carbon substrates tends to lower
the adsorption energies of CO2 and N2 between
a flat graphene surface and (8,0) CNT. Since TM-porphyrin-like graphene
substrate could bend under compressive strain as noted above, these
results indicate that as a result of substrate bending, the CO2 adsorption energies under compressive strain could be lower
than the values presented in Figure 5. This would result in higher CO2 capture
capacities than the ones predicted in Table 2. Sudden decrease in the magnitudes of CO2 and N2 adsorption energies on (6,0) and (4,0)
CNT substrates is understood to be due to the fact that carbon atoms
other than those adjacent to nitrogen atoms forming a porphyrin-like
structure, even those located on the opposite side of the TM atom
on the CNT surface, could affect the adsorption on the CNT substrates
with small radii. This suggests that the adsorption processes of flue
gases on TM-porphyrin-like CNT substrates smaller than the (8,0) CNT
cannot be understood purely by the substrate bending effects.

Conclusions
We performed first-principle DFT calculations for CO2 capture on Sc-, Ti-, and V-decorated porphyrin-like graphenes under
mechanical strain to explore the feasibility of controlling the capture
process at room temperature under low pressures. Application of compressive
strain to a TM-porphyrin-like graphene was found to increase the distance
between the decorated TM atom and the graphene sheet, which allowed
d orbitals of the TM atom to be more activated for hybridization with
CO2 π-orbitals and resulted in the lowering of the
CO2 adsorption energy due to stronger Dewar interaction.
From this, we discovered that TM-porphyrin-like nanostructures could
selectively capture CO2 molecules with compressive strain
and release them under tensional strain. While the Ti-decorated porphyrin-like
graphene did not show controllability of CO2 capture with
mechanical strain, the Sc- and V-decorated ones revealed great controlling
efficiency of CO2 capture for the precombustion system.
For the oxy-fuel and postcombustion flue-gas models, however, only
Sc-decorated substrate exhibited significant CO2 capture
controllability. These results lead us to conclude that nanostructures
containing TM elements with empty d orbitals can be applied to control
selective CO2 capture from flue gases with mechanical strain.

Bending effects of the graphene substrate under compressive strain
were investigated through DFT calculations of the adsorption energies
of flue gases on TM-porphyrin-like CNTs with various curvatures. Both
CO2 and N2 adsorption energies were found to
lower significantly with the increase in the substrate curvature from
graphene to (8,0) CNT, while the adsorption energies of other flue
gases such as CH4 and H2 showed little dependence
on CNT curvature. From this, we expect that a possible bending of
the substrate under compressive strain would make the control of selective
CO2 capture process from flue gas with mechanical strain
more feasible. The first-principle results discussed in this study
have the potential for use in the development of a new approach to
engineer controlling media for CO2 capture at room temperature
by applying mechanical strain without the thermodynamic process of
combustion. Experimental realization of this new approach for CO2 capture could be expedited by recent development in strain
engineering as demonstrated for graphenes and nanowires suspended
over a trench.48

Computational Methods and
Details
Our first-principle DFT calculations were performed
as implemented
in the Vienna ab initio simulation package with the projector augmented
wave method. The GGA-PBE exchange correlation functional was used,
and the kinetic energy cutoff was taken to be 900 eV. For calculations
of gas molecule adsorption on a substrate, the model substrate of
the graphene-based system comprised a 4 × 4 hexagonal supercell,
whose composition was TM-N4C26. Geometrical
optimization of the graphene-based system was carried out until the
Hellmann–Feynman force acting on each atom was less than 0.01
eV/Å. The first Brillouin zone integration was performed using
the Monkhorst–Pack scheme. A 2 × 2 k-point
sampling was used for the 4 × 4 graphene supercells.

Biaxial
mechanical strain was uniformly applied to the TM-decorated
porphyrin-like graphene. The range of strain we considered was +3%
(extension) to −3% (compression) with 0.5% regular intervals
in all directions. It was assumed that only one molecule could be
captured on the central metal in a unit cell.
