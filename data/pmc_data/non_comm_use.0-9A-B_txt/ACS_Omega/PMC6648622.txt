The
spray-forming process of the nano-titanium silicalite (TS-1) zeolite
was investigated and optimized in the lab in order to obtain materials
with microsphere morphology and superior catalytic activity in cyclohexanone
ammoximation on the industrial scale. The effects of spray-forming
parameters, such as the state of the TS-1 raw material, load ratio,
solid content, binder content, and calcination temperature, on the
physicochemical and catalytic properties of TS-1 microspheres were
investigated in detail. It was interesting to find that the shape
of the spray-forming sample formed by wet powders was more intact
than the sample formed by dried powders. Furthermore, the spray-forming
process was successfully scaled up to a large spray device (LGZ-1000)
according to the similarity principle of load ratio, and the shape
of the TS-1 microspheres was as perfect as the spray-forming samples
in the lab. The similarity principle of the load ratio for the spray-forming
of titanium silicate was established and verified for the first time.
The spray-forming TS-1 microspheres produced in the industry were
used in cyclohexanone ammoximation, and ketone conversion and oxime
selectivity were as high as 99.9 and 99.4%, respectively.

1 Introduction
TS-1
was first hydrothermally synthesized by Taramasso et al. in 1983.1 Because of the unique four-coordinated Ti in
the framework, the catalytic system composed of TS-1 and hydrogen
peroxide had a prominent catalytic oxidation performance for the selective
oxidation of organic compounds,2−5 such as the epoxidation of olefins,6−8 the ammoximation of ketones,9−11 the oxidation of saturated alkanes,12−14 and the hydroxylation of aromatic compounds.15,16

Nanosized TS-1 powders displayed higher catalytic activity
than the micron-sized TS-1 because of the short diffusion path.17−19 However, the difficult separation of nanosized particles20 limited their wide application in industrial
production. Therefore, it is necessary to meet the requirements of
industrial production by controlling the particle sizes through catalyst-forming.
Larger-formed catalyst particles could be obtained by spray drying,
extrusion, and so on.21 Compared with the
extruded catalysts, the spray-forming catalysts had better activity
in cyclohexanone ammoximation, and the reusability and stability were
much better.22 The spray-forming process
was one of the effective methods to improve the catalyst particles
and simplify their separation from the reaction system.23

The spray-forming process has been reported
by several research studies.22,29 Samples prepared by
the spray-forming process possessed microsphere morphology and showed
high activity. The molar ratio of silica to TS-1 should be controlled
within the range of 0.05 to 0.11,24−26 and the silica could
improve the mechanical strength of the formed body. The median particle
diameter weighted by volume of the TS-1 used for spray-drying was
preferably below 5 microns.27 Hasenzahl
et al.28 prepared the spray-drying TS-1
granulates composed of TS-1 crystals, silicon dioxide, and titanium
dioxide, and the TS-1 granulates had a diameter between 5 and 300
μm and some of them may be hollow. The spray-forming sample
showed a similar catalytic performance to the TS-1 powders.22 The spray-forming process could prohibit membrane
fouling and improved the catalytic stability.29 Furthermore, the spray-forming process could also reduce the loss
of the catalysts.

Although spray-forming has been widely used
in industrial production, there are few reports about it and a lack
of systematic research studies. In this work, different raw material
states and load ratios were investigated in the lab to get TS-1 microspheres
with intact shape. We found that it is necessary to control the load
ratio for the spray-forming process. Likewise, the effects of solid
content, binder content, and calcination temperature on the spray-forming
TS-1 microspheres were also investigated. The obtained TS-1 microspheres
exhibited high activity in cyclohexanone ammoximation. Furthermore,
the spray-forming process was carried out on a large-scale spray device.
Ketone conversion and oxime selectivity were all above 99%.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Effect of the Raw Material
State
The effect of the raw material state on the spray-forming
process was investigated in this section. Dried powders and wet powders
were prepared to compare each other.

Figure 1 presents the SEM images of the TS-1 microspheres
with different raw material states. Compared with the spray-forming
TS-1 microspheres with dried powders, the sample formed by wet powders
had a smoother appearance and were close to sphere. It suggested that
the raw material states had a great effect on the shape of the TS-1
microspheres. Schüth et al.21 found
that the capillarity and liquid bridges were the most important mechanisms
in the forming stage. The capillarity partly solved the problem of
size fractionation, as the capillary force would counterbalance the
gravity. Liquid bridges were typically the most significant forces
between particles for short distances. The strong forces exerted by
the liquids between small particles were the main reason why mostly
wet powders were used in the spray-forming process.

Figure 1 SEM images of the spray-forming
samples with different raw material states: (a) dried powders and
(b) wet powders.

The determination of
the mechanical strength was carried out according to the research
of Wang et al.30 The TS-1 microspheres
were suspended in water and then subjected to ultrasonic treatment
(0.6 g Cat. in 35 g H2O). The SEM images of the samples
after ultrasonic treatment (80 min) are shown in Figure S1. Only few of the microspheres were broken after
the ultrasonic treatment of the microspheres formed by wet powders.
As for the spray-forming sample with dried powders, the sample was
broken seriously after the ultrasonic treatment. The above results
indicated that the mechanical strength of the TS-1 microspheres with
wet powders was much better than that of the dried powders, which
was because there was more Si–OH in the wet powders than in
the dried powders. Si–OH could condense to form siloxane bridges
at the contact point by eliminating water; if several such bonds could
be formed, this might impart substantial strength to the formed body.21 Likewise, the above samples after ultrasonic
treatment were filtered. The Tyndall effect (Figure S2) also illustrated the above problem; the filtrate of the
spray-forming sample with dried powders showed an obvious Tyndall
effect, indicating the loss of the catalyst. Some of them were broken
seriously, and partially suspended particles could penetrate the filter
layer to the filtrate.

Table S1 presents
the mean particle diameter of the samples before and after attrition.
The mean particle sizes decreased more for the spray forming sample
with dried powder. It can be seen that the attrition extent of the
spray forming sample using dried powder is greater than that of wet
powder. Thus, the mechanical strength of the sample formed by using
wet raw material is greater than that with dried powder.

2.2 Effect of the Feeding Rate and Inlet Temperature
The
feeding rate and inlet temperature had a great effect on the shape
of the spray-forming samples. The effect of inlet temperature was
studied by keeping the feeding rate constant (1.08 kg/h) and simply
varying the inlet temperature, whereas the effect of the feeding rate
on the shape of the spray-forming samples was studied by keeping the
inlet temperature constant (493 K) and varying the feeding rate. The
feeding rate of the spray-forming slurry played a great role in the
spray-forming process, and a concept named load ratio was proposed
according to the feeding rate. The load ratio referred to the feeding
rate of water in the slurry to the maximum water evaporation quantity
of the spray device (listed in eq 4). The load ratios investigated in this section are
listed in Table 1. 4  

Table 1 Detailed Parameters of the Samples
with Different Load Ratiosa
no.	sample	FRWSb (kg/h)	load ratio (%)	
1	LTS-20	0.4	20	
2	LTS-40	0.8	40	
3	LTS-60	1.2	60	
a The maximum
water evaporation quantity of the device is 2 kg/h.

b FRWS: Feeding rate of water in the spray-forming
slurry.

The SEM images of
the samples with different inlet temperatures are shown in Figure S3. It can be seen that there will be
formation of irregular micron-sized particles when the inlet temperature
is too high or too low. The shape of the sample with the inlet temperature
of 493 K (Figure S3b) was closer to spherical
than the other samples.

Figure 2 presents the SEM images of the spray-forming samples
with different load ratios. The shape of the microspheres was not
intact, and microspheres with small sizes had broken up, when the
load ratio of spray device was 20% (Figure 2a). It was because the drying speed of the
droplets was too fast. The shape of the TS-1 microspheres turned out
to be perfect with the load ratio of spray device of 40%. When the
load ratio of spray device was increased to 60%, some droplets could
not be dried in time, resulting in agglomeration. These results indicated
that the load ratio of the device influenced the shape of the spray-forming
samples significantly. A proper load ratio ensured that spray-forming
equipment had adequate elastic control for the slurry.

Figure 2 SEM images of the spray-forming
samples with different load ratios: (a) 20, (b) 40, and (c) 60%.

Figure S4 presents the SEM images of the samples with different load ratios
after ultrasonic treatment. Compared with other samples, the sample
was hardly broken after ultrasonic treatment, when the load ratio
of spray device was 40%. The above result indicated that the spray-forming
sample with the load ratio of spray device 40% had better mechanical
strength. The mean particle sizes of the samples before and after
attrition are shown in Table S2. It can
be seen that the attrition extent of the sample is lighter, when the
load ratio of spray device is 40%.

2.3 Effect
of the Solid Content
The solid content referred to the mass
percent of TS-1 powder and silica in the spray-forming slurry. The
effect of solid content on the spray-forming process was investigated
in this section.

Figure 3 shows the SEM images of the spray-forming samples with different
solid contents. It can be seen that almost all of them show spherical
shape, indicating that the different solid contents have no obvious
effect on the appearance of the spray-forming microspheres. The particle
sizes of the TS-1 microspheres were in the range of 1–23 μm.

Figure 3 SEM images
of spray-forming TS-1 microspheres with different solid contents:
(a) 20.0, (b) 22.5, (c) 25.0, (d) 27.5, and (e) 30.0%.

The XRD patterns of the different solid content
samples are shown in Figure 4A. All of them had obvious diffraction peaks at 8.0°,
8.9°, 23.1°, 24.0°, and 24.4°, which were attributed
to the characteristic peaks of TS-1 with an mordenite framework invertion
(MFI) structure.5 The image of the FT-IR
spectra is shown in Figure 4B. The absorption peaks at around 1220, 1100, and 800 cm–1 were attributed to the MFI topology. The absorption
bands at 550 and 800 cm–1 were attributed to the
stretching vibration and flexural vibration of Si–O–Si,
respectively. The absorption peaks at around 960 cm–1 could be considered as the fingerprint of the framework Ti.32,33 The intensity ratios of absorption band at 960 cm–1 to the band at 550 cm–1 (I960/I550) for different solid content
samples are summarized in Table S3. It
can be seen clearly that the I960/I550 value of the sample with a solid content
of 25.0% was higher than other samples, indicating more framework
Ti in the sample.

Figure 4 (A) XRD and (B) FT-IR images of the TS-1 microspheres
with different solid contents: (a) 20.0, (b) 22.5, (c) 25.0, (d) 27.5,
and (e) 30.0%.

The nitrogen sorption
isotherms of the TS-1 microspheres with different solid contents are
shown in Figure S5. The adsorption isotherm
was in good agreement with the desorption isotherm from 0 to 0.5,
indicating the existence of micropores. A hysteresis loop appeared
between 0.5 and 1.0, which was attributed to the mesopores.29 The surface areas and pore volumes of these
samples are shown in Table S4. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET)-specific surface area (427 m2/g) and the microporous
surface area (335 m2/g) of the sample with the solid content
of 25.0% were higher than those of other samples, which would be one
of the reasons for its higher catalytic activity.

Table 2 presents the results of cyclohexanone
ammoximation over the spray-forming TS-1 microspheres with different
solid contents. The products were mainly cyclohexanone oxime, along
with some high boiling byproducts.31 The
highest conversion of cyclohexanone was obtained over the sample with
a solid content of 25.0% (Table 2, no. 3), because the more the framework Ti content
(Table S3), the more available were the
active sites.34 Meanwhile, the BET-specific
surface area (427 m2/g) and turnover frequency (TOF) value
(652.6 h–1) of the sample with a solid content of
25.0% also appeared to be higher, but there was no obvious difference
in the total Ti content.

2.4 Effect
of the Binder Content
In this section, silica sol was selected
as the binder for the forming catalysts silica had many hydroxyl groups
on their surface; they could condense with the Si–OH of TS-1
to form siloxane bridges, and siloxane bridges might import substantial
strength to the formed body.21

The
SEM images of the TS-1 microspheres with different binder contents
are shown in Figure 5. As shown in Figure 5a, almost every microsphere had a dimple, when the binder content
was 0%. With the increase of the binder content, the dimples had been
greatly reduced, and the shape of the microspheres turned out to be
more intact. It was because adding a binder was likely to improve
the gel- or film-forming property of the spray-forming slurry.21 The samples after ultrasonic treatment are shown
in Figure S6. Obviously, the sample without
a binder was the most seriously broken; for the samples with a binder,
there were almost no differences between them after ultrasonic treatment,
and only few microspheres were broken, indicating the necessity of
adding a binder to the spray-forming slurry. Table S5 shows the mean particle diameter of the samples with different
binder content before and after attrition tests. The attrition extent
of the sample without binder was more serious than the samples with
binder.

Figure 5 SEM images of the spray-forming TS-1 microspheres with different
binder contents: (a) 0, (b) 5, (c) 10, (d) 15, (e) 20, and (f) 25%.

Figure 6A presents the XRD patterns of the spray-forming
samples with different binder contents. The diffraction peaks at around
8.0°, 8.9°, 23.1°, 24.0°, and 24.4° were
detected apparently, which indicated that all of the samples possessed
the typical MFI typology. Figure 6B presents
the FT-IR spectra of the TS-1 microspheres with different binder contents.
All of the samples had characteristic bands at 1220, 1100, 960, 800,
and 550 cm–1, respectively.

images of the TS-1 microspheres with different binder contents: (a)
0, (b) 5, (c) 10, (d) 15, (e) 20, and (f) 25%.

Figure S7 shows the N2 physisorption isotherms of the spray-forming TS-1 microspheres with
different binder contents. The samples possessed typical type IV adsorption–desorption
curves. Table S6 presents the surface areas
and pore volumes of the samples with different binder contents. The
BET-specific surface areas of the samples varied between 372 and 440
m2/g. An obvious decrease in the BET-specific surface area
could be seen clearly, when the binder content was increased, which
was due to the reduction of the TS-1 ratio in the microspheres. The
binder had a bridging effect,21 which might
increase the total pore volume.

Catalytic performances for cyclohexanone
ammoximation over the samples with different binder contents are shown
in Table 3. With the
increase of the binder content, the activity of cyclohexanone ammoximation
was significantly reduced. The decrease in activity was due to the
fact that the percentage of the effective active component in the
TS-1 microspheres reduced. Meanwhile, the binder also blocked a certain
proportion of pores, which reduced the activity utilization of the
catalyst. The total Ti content also decreased, which was due to the
increase of the binder content. The TOF values (Table 3) of the samples with a binder content of
0% (678.9 h–1) and 5% (673.6 h–1) were close to each other. Although the sample without a binder
showed a higher activity, the dimples of the TS-1 microspheres would
affect the mechanical strength of the catalysts, so we chose the binder
content of 5%.

analysis.

2.5 Effect
of the Calcination Temperature
The calcination temperature
of the spray-forming TS-1 microspheres had a great effect on the catalytic
activity, and the appropriate temperature was beneficial to obtaining
higher activity. The organic compounds could not be removed completely
if the calcination temperature was too low;35 in contrast, the catalyst would be sintered, if the calcination
temperature was too high.36

The XRD
patterns of the samples with different calcination temperatures are
shown in Figure 7A.
All of the five samples had the typical topological structure of the
TS-1, which conformed to the MFI topology, indicating that the high
calcination temperature (1073 K) would not damage the MFI structure
of the TS-1 microspheres. The FT-IR spectra of the spray-forming TS-1
microspheres with different calcination temperatures are shown in Figure 7B. All of them showed
the characteristic absorption peaks of TS-1. The intensity ratios
of the absorption band at 960 cm–1 to the band at
550 cm–1 (I960/I550) for different calcination temperature samples
are summarized in Table S7. It can be seen
that the I960/I550 of the sample with the calcination temperature of 873 K is higher
than other samples.

Figure 7 (A) XRD and (B) FT-IR images of spray-forming TS-1 microspheres
with different calcination temperatures: (a) 823, (b) 873, (c) 933,
(d) 993, and (e) 1073 K.

Figure S8 presents the nitrogen
sorption isotherms of TS-1 microspheres with different calcination
temperatures. All the samples showed a pronounced hysteresis loop
with an abrupt closure on the desorption branch. The results of the
surface areas and pore volumes are presented in Table S8. The BET specific surface areas of 823 and 873 K
were larger than those of other samples. It was due to the fact that
the binder was amorphous, and it could be sintered and blocked the
channels at a higher calcination temperature.

Catalytic performances
for cyclohexanone ammoximation over the samples with different calcination
temperatures are shown in Table 4. The samples with the calcination temperatures of
823 and 873 K exhibited similar catalytic activities. The activities
decreased gradually, when the temperature was increased over 873 K.
It might be because the samples were sintered at the high calcination
temperature, which would cause the channel plugging.

min; temperature, 353 K.

2.6 Scale-up of the Spray-Forming Process
The above results
showed that the spray-forming TS-1 microspheres synthesized in the
lab could possess an intact shape and high catalytic activity. To
demonstrate the industrial application feasibility, the spray-forming
process was scaled up on the spray device of LGZ-1000 (the maximum
water evaporation quantity of the device is 1000 kg/h). Considering
that the particle sizes of the TS-1 microspheres produced in the industry
were larger than the samples produced in the lab, the inlet temperature
was 573 K. Table 5 presents
the detailed parameters of the spray-forming TS-1 microspheres produced
in the industry with different load ratios.

Table 5 Detailed
Parameters of the Different Samples
no.	sample	device	FRWS (kg/h)	load
ratio (%)	magnification	
1	MTS-75	LGZ-1000	750	75	500	
2	MTS-40	LGZ-1000	400	40	500	
3	LTS-40	TK-6000Y	0.8	40	1	
Figure 8 shows the SEM images of the spray-forming
samples with different load ratios. Obviously, the particle size of
the samples formed on LGZ-1000 was larger than the samples formed
on TK-6000Y, which was because the dimensions of the spray dryer were
among the crucial factors that determined the size of the final particles.21 The shape of the sample MTS-40 with a load ratio
of 40% was closer to spheres than that of the sample MTS-75 with a
load ratio of 75%. Combined with Table 5, the shape of the sample MTS-75 was irregular, which
was because the load ratio was too high. The droplets could not be
dried in time, which resulted in agglomeration. The shape of the obtained
sample MTS-40 with a load ratio of 40% was almost as perfect as the
LTS-40. The similarity principle of the load ratio laid the foundation
for the industrial production of spray-drying granulates with an intact
shape.

Figure 8 SEM images of the different load ratio samples: (a) MTS-75 and (b)
MTS-40.

Figure 9A presents the XRD pattern of MTS-40 formed
on the LGZ-1000. The sample possessed the typical MFI structure without
the impurity phase. The FT-IR spectra (Figure 9B) of the sample also showed characteristic
absorption bands of TS-1 at 550, 800, 960, 1100, and 1220 cm–1.

Figure 9 (A) XRD and (B) FT-IR images of the sample MTS-40.

Figure S9 shows the
nitrogen sorption isotherms of the sample MTS-40 formed on LGZ-1000.
An obvious hysteresis loop appeared in the isotherm, which was due
to the appearance of the mesopores. The surface areas and pore volumes
of the sample MTS-40 are shown in Table S9. The surface areas and pore volumes of the sample MTS-40 were close
to the sample with the binder content of 5% in Section 2.4.

Catalytic performances for cyclohexanone
ammoximation over the sample MTS-40 are presented in Table 6. It can be seen that the sample
MTS-40 exhibited a high catalytic activity in cyclohexanone ammoximation,
indicating that the spray-forming process had been successfully scaled
up for the industrial production.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, TS-1 microspheres were prepared through the spray-forming
process. The effects of the raw material state, feeding rate, inlet
temperature, solid content, binder content, and calcination temperature
on the shape and catalytic properties of the TS-1 microspheres were
investigated.

On the basis of the investigations we did above,
the shape of the microspheres was the most perfect when the raw material
was wet and the load ratio was 40%. The activity turned out to be
the best when the solid content was 25.0%, the binder content was
5%, and the calcination temperature was 873 K. According to the conditions
optimized in the lab, the spray-forming process was scaled up to a
large spray device successfully, and the shape of the sample was almost
as perfect as the spray-forming samples in the lab. The sample formed
on the LGZ-1000 with a load ratio of 40% was used in cyclohexanone
ammoximation, and the cyclohexanone conversion and oxime selectivity
were as high as 99.9 and 99.4%, respectively. This work provides an
alternative process for the production of spray-forming TS-1 microspheres
from screening to scale-up.

4 Experiment Section
4.1 Preparation of TS-1 Powders
The preparation of the
TS-1 catalyst was according to the hydrothermal synthesis method.1 TPAOH was mixed with distilled water followed
by the addition of TEOS and kept under stirring for 3 h. TBOT was
dissolved in isopropanol and added dropwise into the above mixture
and kept under stirring for another 3 h. The mixture was transferred
into a Teflon-lined autoclave for hydrothermal synthesis at 448 K
for 48 h. The obtained products were filtered and washed with distilled
water, dried overnight at 393 K, and calcined at 823 K for 6 h.

4.2 Preparation of Nano-Sized TS-1 with a Hollow Structure
The modification of the TS-1 was carried out in a Teflon-lined
autoclave by keeping the as-synthesized TS-1, ethanolamine, and TPABr
isothermal at 448 K for 48 h. The final product was filtered and washed
with distilled water. Here, the separated filter cake was denoted
as wet powders, and the sample calcined at 823 K was denoted as dried
powders.

4.3 Preparation of Spray-Forming Catalysts
Spray-forming slurry was prepared by adding TS-1, silica, PEG-400,
and water to a beaker and quickly stirred until the mixture was uniformly
obtained. Here, silica was used as a binder and PEG-400 as a dispersant.
The spray-drying process in the lab was carried out on a machine of
TK-6000Y (the samples with the load ratios of 20, 40, and 60% were
denoted as LTS-20, LTS-40, and LTS-60, respectively), whereas the
spray-drying process in the industry was carried out on LGZ-1000 (the
samples with the load ratios of 75 and 40% were denoted as MTS-75
and MTS-40, respectively).

4.4 Characterizations
The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) pattern was recorded on a PW 3040/60
automatic X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα (λ = 1.54 Å)
radiation in the scanning range of 5°–50° at a scanning
rate of 1.2° min–1 to confirm the structure
of the catalysts. The current and voltage were 40 mA and 40 kV, respectively.
The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were taken on a Quanta
250 FEG microscope. The N2 sorption isotherms were prepared
using a NOVA 1000e at 77 K. The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR)
spectra were recorded on a Thermo Nicolet IR 2000 Spectrometer. The
attrition strength was carried out using rotating crash test, and
the mean particle sizes of the samples before and after attribution
were compared.

4.5 Catalytic Reaction
Cyclohexanone ammoximation (Scheme 1) was carried out using a three-neck flask equipped
with a condenser and a magnetic stirrer. Cyclohexanone (0.06 mol)
and t-BuOH (0.18 mol) were added to the three-neck
flask, and the mixture was heated to 353 K. The reaction happened
by adding ammonia (0.07 mol) through a pipette, while H2O2 (0.07 mol) was added through a pump for 1 h. Then,
the mixture was stirred for another 15 min. The mixture was analyzed
by gas chromatography. The calculations of cyclohexanone conversion,
cyclohexanone oxime yield, and cyclohexanone oxime selectivity were
obtained according to eqs 1–3, respectively. 1   2   3  

Scheme 1 Chemical Equation of the Cyclohexanone Ammoximation Reaction
X was the
cyclohexanone conversion, Y was the yield of the
cyclohexanone oxime, S was the selectivity of the
cyclohexanone oxime, n1 was the initial
mole of the cyclohexanone, n2 was the
residual mole of the cyclohexanone, and m was the
mole of the cyclohexanone oxime after the reaction.
