The use of a 10-nm-thick buffer layer
enabled tailoring of the
characteristics, such as film deposition and structural and electrical
properties, of magnetron-sputtered Al-doped ZnO (AZO) films containing
unintentionally retained Ar atoms. The AZO films were deposited on
glass substrates coated with the buffer layer via direct-current magnetron
sputtering using Ar gas, a substrate temperature of 200 °C, and
sintered AZO targets with an Al2O3 content of
2.0 wt %. The use of a Ga-doped ZnO film possessing a texture with
a specific well-defined orientation as the buffer layer was very effective
for improving the crystallographic orientation, reducing the residual
stress, and improving the carrier transport of the AZO films. The
residual compressive stress and in-grain carrier mobility were responsible
for the retention of Ar atoms by the films, as observed using an electron
probe microanalyzer.

Introduction
Magnetron sputtering (MS) is the most
commonly used deposition
technique for transparent conductive oxide (TCO) films, such as Sn-doped
In2O3 (indium tin oxide (ITO)). ITO films deposited
by MS1 are industry standard for numerous
applications in photovoltaics,2 flat-panel
displays,3 organic light-emitting diodes,4 and smart windows.5,6 On the other
hand, Al- or Ga-doped ZnO (AZO or GZO),7−21 Nb-doped TiO2,22,23 and BaSnO324,25 films as an alternative material to replace the ITO
films have been tried by the MS technique. However, one issue concerning
magnetron-sputtered TCO films has yet to be resolved, namely, the
nonuniform spatial distribution of electrical resistivity (ρ)
on the substrate surface.1,7−21 Specifically, the area of the substrate opposite to the erosion
zone of the target typically exhibits a relatively high ρ compared
to that of other regions farther from this area.1,7−21 At present, the dominant factors responsible for this degradation
of the electrical properties of the substrate opposite to the erosion
zone of the target are not thoroughly understood. In an effort to
address this issue, we have been investigating the influence of the
erosion zone of MS targets on carrier transport in magnetron-sputtered
AZO films on glass substrates. In our previous study, we detected relatively high amounts of
residual argon (Ar) in AZO films deposited using direct-current (DC)
MS compared with those deposited using radio frequency (RF) MS, irrespective
of the substrate position.20 It was found
that during film deposition recoiling Ar atoms collide with the growing
AZO films, especially at the substrate positions opposite to the erosion
zone. The impact of Ar atoms increases the contribution of grain-boundary
scattering to the carrier transport owing to the deterioration of
the crystallographic orientation. The residual Ar atoms present a
significant obstacle to the free carriers in the in-grains, leading
to a reduced carrier mobility. Our previous20 and present studies are the first to characterize the effects of
Ar atoms on the film deposition, carrier transport properties, and
crystallographic orientation in magnetron-sputtered TCO films. Based
on these findings, to achieve a uniform spatial distribution of ρ,
it is necessary to develop a technology that suppresses the effects
of Ar atoms on the crystallographic orientation of as-deposited films
grown at the substrate positions opposite to the erosion zone. To
reduce the impact of Ar atoms, a two-step deposition process using
a buffer layer,17,26−29 which was first explored in the
case of gallium nitride (GaN),27−29 may be an effective method for
fabricating AZO films with little contribution of grain-boundary scattering
to carrier transport owing to the enhanced c-axis
alignment between the columnar grains. Note that the buffer layers
would play an important role in the increase in carrier concentration
owing to the reduced local disorder,30 which
also lead to the formation of a grain-boundary-potential barrier with
a small energy difference relative to the Fermi level, resulting in
a decrease in the contribution of grain-boundary scattering to carrier
transport.31 By a comparison of the amounts
of residual Ar atoms between AZO films with a buffer layer, showing
a texture with a well-defined (0001) orientation as a result of the
control of the crystallographic orientation, and buffer-layer-free
AZO films with mixture orientation, we will elucidate the locations
of residual Ar atoms such as the sites trapped at the surface of grain
boundary and in-grains. The concept of the buffer layer leading to
the changes in the locations of residual Ar atoms presented in this
study is significantly different from that of the previous reports.17,26−29

In this study, we used 10-nm-thick Ga-doped ZnO (GZO) films
deposited
via DC arc discharge ion plating (IP) as the buffer layer. The main
features of this buffer layer are a very smooth surface and a texture
exhibiting a well-defined (0001) orientation, in contrast to buffer
layers fabricated using RF-MS.32−34 We previously demonstrated that
AZO films deposited on a 10-nm-thick GZO buffer layer using IP exhibited
a well-defined (0001) orientation, in stark contrast to the mixture
of (0001) and other orientations typically observed for DC-magnetron-sputtered
AZO films.32−34 Consequently, highly (0001)-oriented AZO films with
a marked reduction in the contribution of grain-boundary scattering
to the carrier transport were obtained. However, the influence of
the buffer layer on the crystallographic orientation, distribution,
and carrier transport in the DC-magnetron-sputtered AZO films was
investigated at substrate positions distant from the area opposite
to the erosion zone of the target.32−34 In this study, we examined
the influence of the improved orientation distribution due to the
buffer layer on the carrier transport in DC-magnetron-sputtered AZO
films at substrate positions both in the area opposite to the erosion
zone of the target and farther away from this area.

Experimental
Section
Film Deposition
We deposited AZO films on alkali-free
glass substrates (Corning, Eagle XG) with or without a 10-nm-thick
buffer layer at a substrate temperature of 200 °C via DC–MS
using an MS apparatus (ULVAC, CS-L) operating at a power of 200 W.
The target was a high-density sintered ceramic circular AZO (diameter,
8 cm; Toshima Manufacturing Corp.) with an Al2O3 content of 2.0 wt %. The reason that we chose the ceramic target
is to limit the supply of oxygen-related species to the films from
the target during the deposition process. The reason we chose Al atoms
as eminently suitable for donors, leading to high carrier transport,
is as follows. Table 1 lists valence-shell-orbital radii (Rmax)35 and atomic term values, valence-shell-orbital
energies, of Al, Ga, Zn, and O atoms.36 It shows that Rmax, the radius at which
the magnitude of wave function is greatest, for the valence orbitals,
3s and 3p orbitals, of Al atoms
are larger than those for the valence orbitals, 4s and 4p orbitals, of Ga atoms. This implies that
larger concentrations of Ga donors are required before their orbitals
can overlap sufficiently for metallic conduction to occur, compared
to those of Al donors. Notice that the energy difference between −εs of Al and Zn atom is smaller than that between
−εs of Ga and Zn atoms.36 The interaction between Al and Zn atoms owing
to an overlap of valence s orbitals will be stronger that that between
Ga and Zn atoms, resulting in the formation of an Al-impurity band
with a wide bandwidth inserted into the bottom of the host conduction
band compared to the bandwidth of a Ga-impurity band located in the
vicinity of the bottom of the conduction band of GZO films. Taking
into account the features of Al valence orbitals and the Al-impurity
band described above, it would be expected that AZO films exhibit
high carrier transport in grains compared to that of GZO films.

The substrate was placed parallel
to the target surface at a minimum
substrate-to-target distance of 10 cm. The properties of the magnetron-sputtered
AZO films at substrate positions in the area opposite to the erosion
zone of the target and farther away from this area were evaluated
at substrate positions of 0.5 and 6.5 cm, respectively, as depicted
in Figure 1a (plane
view) and Figure 1b
(cross-sectional view).20 All of the deposition
processes were performed under a pure Ar atmosphere at a pressure
of 1.0 Pa. Prior to film deposition, the chamber was evacuated until
the base pressure reached approximately 2.0 × 10–5 Pa.20 Following a previous report that
the radial distributions of the electrical parameters depend on the
erosion depth of the target,15 we deposited
all of the AZO films at approximately the same time when the erosion
depth of the target exceeded 1 mm.

target and
substrate configuration: (a) plane and (b) cross-sectional views.
The red solid area at a substrate position of 0.5 cm is opposite to
the erosion zone of the target. The blue solid area at a substrate
position of 6.5 cm is farther away from the erosion zone.

We deposited the 10-nm-thick buffer layer of GZO on the glass
substrates
using an IP apparatus (Sumitomo Heavy Industries, Ltd.) with a DC
arc discharge current of 150 A. We introduced oxygen (O2) gas into the chamber at a flow rate of 10 sccm to control the density
of oxygen-related point defects such as oxygen vacancies and oxygen
interstitials in the resulting film. The evaporation source (HAKUSUI
Tech., Sky-Z) used for the deposition of the buffer layer was sintered
ceramic ZnO (99.99% purity) containing 4.0 wt % Ga2O3 (99.9% purity).37 Additional details
regarding the buffer layer are reported previously.32−34

Characterization
We measured the film thickness using
a surface profilometer (KLA-Tencor, α-Step IQ). The microscopic
morphology of the samples was evaluated using field-emission scanning
electron microscopy (FESEM; Hitachi, SU9000). Photoluminescence (PL)
measurements were performed at room temperature; the films were photoexcited
using the 325 nm (3.815 eV) line of a HeCd laser, and the luminescent
light was monitored using a spectrometer (Princeton Instruments, SP2500)
equipped with a charge-coupled device detector (PIXIS256E).38 The carrier concentration (N), Hall mobility (μH), and ρ were determined
using Hall effect measurements (Nanometrics, HL5500PC) at room temperature
according to the van der Pauw method. The optical properties were
measured using a spectrophotometer (Hitachi, U-4100) and two different
spectroscopic ellipsometers (J.A. Woollam, M-2000DI and IR-VASE Mark
II). The optical transmittance (T) and reflectance
(R) spectra of the AZO films in the wavelength range
of 200–2400 nm were obtained using the spectrophotometer with
an incident angle of 5°. The ellipsometric data (Ψ and
Δ) were acquired in the wavelength ranges of 0.3–1.7
μm (M-2000DI) and 1.7–30 μm (IR-VASE Mark II) at
incident angles of 55, 65, and 75°.

For a comprehensive
analysis of the texture, we conducted out-of-plane grazing-incidence
(GI) X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements32−34,39,40 using a SmartLab XRD
system (Rigaku Corp.) with Cu Kα̅ radiation (wavelength
λ = 0.15418 nm, based on the weighted average of Cu Kα1 (λ = 0.154059 nm) and Cu Kα2 (λ
= 0.15444 nm) in an intensity ratio of 2:1), where the substrate surface
was subjected to X-ray irradiation at an incident angle (ω)
of 0.35° and only the 2θ axis was scanned. The textures
of the bulk AZO films were characterized on the basis of out-of-plane
wide-range reciprocal space maps (RSMs)20,32−34,37 and pole figures30,33,34,39 by a SmartLab XRD system equipped with a PILATUS 100K/R two-dimensional
X-ray detector using Cu Kα̅ radiation. The incorporated
Ar content was analyzed using an electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA;
JEOL, JXA-8200 or JXA-8500F). The analyzing crystal used for Ar was
PETH (interplanar spacing of the reflecting plane: d = 0.4371 nm).41

The electronic
structure was determined by hard X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (HAXPES) measurements,42,43 which were
performed at BL46XU43 in SPring-8. HAXPES
can be evaluated the electronic states of the bulk lying at depths
of several tens of nanometers due to its large probing depth, compared
with photoelectron spectroscopy using soft X-ray.42,43 An incident X-ray with a photon energy of 7.939 keV, which was monochromatized
with a Si(111) double crystal and Si(444) channel-cut monochromator,
was horizontally and vertically focused on a sample surface by Rh-coated
mirrors. Photoelectron spectra were observed by an electron spectrometer
(VG-Scienta, R-4000). The aperture of the analyzer slit was 0.5 mm
with a curved rectangular shape, and the pass energy was fixed as
200 eV. X-ray was incident on films in the direction of the channel
length at the incident angle of 5°, and the emitted photoelectrons
were detected at the take-off angle of 85°.

Results and Discussion
Crystallographic
Orientation Distribution
Figure 2a,b shows the out-of-plane
wide-range RSMs of buffer-layer-free 500-nm-thick AZO films at substrate
positions of 0.5 and 6.5 cm, respectively. Figure 2c shows the out-of-plane wide-range RSM of
a 500-nm-thick AZO film grown on a buffer layer at a substrate position
of 0.5 cm. q// and q⊥ represent the coordinates of the reciprocal space
in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the surface, respectively
(q = 1/dhkil = 2 sin θ/λ,
where θ and λ are the X-ray incident angle and wavelength,
respectively). The vertical line (i.e., the q⊥ axis) in the RSMs corresponds to a θ/2θ
symmetrical scan of out-of-plane XRD measurements at angles from 10
to 130°. The dashed line corresponds to an orbital of a ω-fixed
2θ scan of out-of-plane GI-XRD, which will be discussed later
alongside Figure 4.
The out-of-plane RSMs demonstrate that all of the AZO films possessed
a wurtzite structure. No peaks indicating the presence of other phases,
such as crystalline Al oxides or other precipitates of Al–O
compounds, were observed. From Figure 2, we determined that all of the AZO films had {0001}
families of planes parallel to the substrate surface, that is, a (0001)
orientation.

Figure 2 Out-of-plane wide-range RSMs of buffer-layer-free AZO
films at
substrate positions of (a) 0.5 cm and (b) 6.5 cm and (c) AZO films
with the buffer layer at a substrate position of 0.5 cm.

Figure 2c
clearly
shows the occurrence of narrow peaks corresponding to the 0002, 0004,
and 0006 reflections with very high intensities for the AZO film grown
on the buffer layer at a substrate position of 0.5 cm. The same peaks
were also observed for the AZO film grown on the buffer layer at a
substrate position of 6.5 cm (data not shown). Thus, it is not necessary
to consider the influence of the erosion zone of the target on the
crystallographic orientation of the textured polycrystalline AZO films
deposited on the buffer layer. Analysis of the data revealed that
the centers of gravity of the peaks for the 0002, 0004, and 0006 reflections
were located approximately on the vertical line, that is, the q⊥ axis of the RSMs. This indicates that
the (0001) plane of the AZO films lay approximately parallel to the
substrate surface. No peaks indicating other orientations, such as
101̅1 diffraction peaks, were observed for these films. This
confirms the highly preferential generation of columnar grains with
the c-axis orientation owing to the well-defined
(0001) orientation throughout the entire AZO film grown on the buffer
layer.32−34

For the buffer-layer-free AZO film at a substrate
position of 0.5
cm (Figure 2a), analysis
of the data obtained from the RSMs revealed that the centers of gravity
of the 101̅0, 112̅2, and 112̅4 reflections, together
with those of the 0002, 0004, and 0006 reflections, were located on
the q⊥ axis of the RSMs. This clearly
demonstrates that the buffer-layer-free AZO film at a substrate position
of 0.5 cm possessed a (0001) orientation mixed with (101̅0),
(112̅2), and (112̅4) orientations.20 On the other hand, the peaks originating from the (112̅2)
and (112̅4) orientations disappeared together with that originating
from the (101̅1) orientation for the buffer-layer-free AZO film
at a substrate position of 6.5 cm, as shown in Figure 2b.30,32−34,40

To estimate the texture
evolution quantitatively, we examined the
variation of the volume fraction of (0001) orientation (V(0001)) obtained from the XRD pole figure measurements. Figure 3a–c shows
XRD pole figures of the 0002 reflections of the same films in Figure 2, respectively. The
upper figure and lower spectra correspond to two-dimensional projections
and variation in intensity with α with radial
averaging over the full range of β, respectively. In these figures,
the distribution of the poles for 0002 reflections appears as a spot
in the center of the figure, or as a spot together with some rings
located at an α range of 20–90°. The first peak
was attributed to the (0001) orientation. The presence of another
peak revealed that AZO films have a mixture of multiple orientations. V(0001) represents the percentage ratio of the
area of the (0001) orientation against whole area. According to this
definition, a greater value of V(0001) corresponds to a stronger (0001) orientation texture.30,33,34,39 We calculated the values of V(0001) to
be 69.7 and 95.0% for the buffer-layer-free AZO films at substrate
positions of 0.5 and 6.5 cm, respectively. The V(0001) values of AZO films grown on a buffer layer were found
to exceed 99%, irrespective of the substrate position, demonstrating
that the inclusion of a buffer layer is an effective strategy for
enhancing the V(0001) of AZO films at
any given substrate position.32−34 At a particular substrate position,
the V(0001) of AZO films grown on a buffer
layer was higher than that of films grown directly on the substrate,
and this effect became very large for substrate positions opposite
to the erosion zone of the target.

α at a fixed β value of XRD pole figures of 0002 reflections
for buffer-layer-free AZO films at substrate positions of (a) 0.5
cm and (b) 6.5 cm and (c) AZO films with the buffer layer at a substrate
position of 0.5 cm.

Texture Evolution
Next, we studied the orientation
distribution during the initial deposition stage of the AZO films.
We performed out-of-plane GI-XRD measurements to investigate the differences
in the deposition mechanism between AZO films with and without a buffer
layer at substrate positions of 0.5 and 6.5 cm. Figure 4a,b shows the out-of-plane GI-XRD patterns of AZO films of
various thicknesses grown in the absence and presence of a buffer
layer, respectively. The upper and lower spectra correspond to substrate
positions of 0.5 and 6.5 cm, respectively. The substrate surface was
subjected to X-ray irradiation at an incident angle (ω) of 0.35°,
and only the 2θ axis was scanned. The reflections observed in
the out-of-plane GI-XRD measurements and their origins were as follows:
(I) solid black inverted triangles (▼) indicate the 0002 reflections,
which correspond to components originating from the (0001) orientation
owing to the tilting of columnar grains with the (0001) orientation;
(II) solid black circles (●) indicate the other reflections
besides the 0002 and 101̅3 reflections, which correspond to
components originating from other orientations; and (III) solid black
diamonds (⧫) indicate the 101̅3 reflections, which correspond
to the trajectory of the scattering vector when the films possess
a (0001) orientation and/or other orientations.32−34,39,40

Figure 4 Out-of-plane GI-XRD patterns
of AZO films (a) without and (b) with
the buffer layer. The upper and lower spectra in each panel correspond
to substrate positions of 0.5 and 6.5 cm, respectively.

The out-of-plane GI-XRD patterns of all of the buffer-layer-free
AZO films in Figure 4a show 0002 and 101̅3 reflections. For the 15-nm-thick AZO
film at a substrate position of 0.5 cm, as shown in the upper part
of Figure 4a, 0002
and 101̅3 reflections were observed. Upon increasing the thickness
to 30 nm, we additionally observed 101̅1, 101̅2 and 112̅0
reflections. Further increasing the thickness to 60 nm led to the
observation of additional 101̅0, 112̅2, 0004, and 202̅2
reflections. The 20-nm-thick AZO film at a substrate position of 6.5
cm predominantly exhibited 0002 and 101̅3 reflections, as shown
in the lower part of Figure 4a. Upon increasing the thickness to 40 nm, we additionally
observed 101̅0, 101̅2, and 112̅2 reflections. With
further increasing the thickness up to 70 nm, the 101̅1 and
112̅0 reflections were also observed in addition to the above-described
five peaks. The variation of the observed reflections as a function
of film thickness may indicate that the buffer-layer-free AZO films
possessed a polycrystalline textured structure consisting of some
crystallites with a low probability of orientations other than the
(0001) orientation during the early stage of film deposition, irrespective
of the substrate position.32−34,39,40 On the other hand, the use of a buffer layer
led to AZO films that exhibited a very intense 101̅3 reflection
and the complete absence of the other reflections, indicating the
successful deposition of AZO films with a well-defined (0001) orientation. Figure 4b clearly shows that
all of the AZO films grown on a buffer layer maintained the same reflection
of 101̅3, irrespective of the film thickness and substrate position.
These findings suggest that the AZO films deposited on the buffer
layer were highly textured with a preferential c-axis
orientation, similar to the results observed for the 500-nm-thick
AZO films grown on the buffer layer, during the early stages of film
deposition.32−34 The use of a buffer layer has therefore been demonstrated
to produce AZO polycrystalline films possessing a textured structure
with a well-defined (0001) orientation, irrespective of the film thickness
and substrate position, resulting in a contribution of grain-boundary
scattering to carrier transport of less than 0.04, which will be discussed
in Electrical Properties and Carrier Transport section.

Figure 5 shows the
in-plane stress (σa) of AZO films with and without
a buffer layer at substrate positions of 0.5 and 6.5 cm for film thicknesses
ranging from 15 to 500 nm. For hexagonal crystals, the in-plane stress,
σa, can be expressed as σa = 2C132 – C33(C11 + C12)/2C13 ×
(lc – lco)/lco,44−46 where Cij are the stiffness constants
with values of C11 = 208.8, C33 = 213.8, C12 = 119.7, and C13 = 104.2 GPa.44lco is the c-axis lattice parameter of stress-free bulk ZnO (lco = 5.207Å).46lc was calculated
from the peak position of the 0002 reflection in the out-of-plane
θ/2θ XRD profiles. Note that negative values of σa indicate residual compressive stress (i.e., increased lc), whereas positive values indicate residual
tensile stress (i.e., decreased lc). We
observed only minor variation between the samples in the values of
the a-axis lattice parameter (la) calculated from the peak positions of the 101̅0 reflection
in the in-plane XRD profiles, indicating that the unit-cell volume
behaved similarly to the tendency of lc.

Figure 5 shows that at a substrate position of 0.5
cm the AZO
films exhibited residual compressive stress irrespective of film thickness.
In these films, increasing the film thickness resulted in a decrease
in the magnitude of σa. These experimental results
also demonstrate the influence of the buffer layer on reducing the
residual compressive stress at a particular film thickness. As described
above, the use of the buffer layer was very effective for achieving
polycrystalline AZO films possessing a texture with a high concentration
of small-angle grain boundaries. In such films, we would expect to
find a very low concentration of residual O atoms trapped at the grain
boundaries. The interatomic forces at the grain boundaries tend to
close any existing gaps with the consequence that the neighboring
crystallites are strained in tension. We observed the above effects
of the small-angle-grain boundaries on the residual stress for AZO
films grown on a buffer layer at a substrate position of 6.5 cm, as
shown in Figure 5.
The film-thickness-dependent σa exhibited unusual
and complex behavior for the buffer-layer-free AZO films at a substrate
position of 6.5 cm. For thick AZO films, we found that the tensile
stress of the grain boundaries appears to remain the dominant stress
mechanism.

Figure 5 In-plane stress σa of AZO films with and without
the buffer layer at substrate positions of 0.5 and 6.5 cm as a function
of film thickness.

Note that the values
of σa for the 500- and 200-nm-thick
AZO films with the buffer layer at a substrate position of 6.5 cm
were almost zero, indicating a stress-free state. In contrast, the
σa values of the AZO films with the buffer layer
at a substrate position of 0.5 cm indicated a large residual compressive
stress despite the presence of the columnar grains with the highly
preferential c-axis orientation. The occurrence of
this residual compressive stress may be attributable to the remaining
Ar incorporated into the AZO films, which will be discussed in the Quality of In-grains section.

Figure 6a,b shows
FESEM images of buffer-layer-free 500-nm-thick AZO films at substrate
positions of 0.5 and 6.5 cm, respectively, and Figure 6c,d shows those of 500-nm-thick AZO films
with the buffer layer at substrate positions of 0.5 and 6.5 cm, respectively.
The left and right sides of each panel show plane and cross-sectional
views, respectively. Figure 6 clearly demonstrates the influence of the buffer layer on
the microstructure of the AZO films; the use of the buffer layer was
very effective for achieving AZO films that grew via columnar grains. Figure 6a,b shows that the
buffer-layer-free AZO films apparently grew via columnar grains during
the initial stage of deposition and subsequently formed grains of
various shapes later in the film deposition process; the lateral grain
size of some of the columns appeared to change during film deposition,
which may be attributable to the recrystallization process and poor
alignment between the columnar grains. Note also that the DC–MS
deposition process afforded AZO films possessing a mixed orientation.
Some of the adatoms on the deposition surface, especially those at
substrate positions opposite to the erosion zone of the target, possess
a high energy, and this excess energy may be sufficient to drive these
atoms into the grain boundaries. The incorporation of excess atoms
into grain boundaries leads to a large residual compressive stress
in the film.

Figure 6 FESEM images of buffer-layer-free AZO films deposited
on glass
substrates at substrate positions of (a) 0.5 and (b) 6.5 cm and AZO
films with the buffer layer at substrate positions of (c) 0.5 cm and
(d) 6.5 cm. The left and right sides of each panel show plane and
cross-sectional views, respectively.

Figure 6c,d shows
that the dense polycrystalline AZO films grown on the buffer layer
exhibited a typical columnar-grain structure with a flat grain surface,
and the lateral grain size of each column appears to remain almost
constant along the film thickness. We have therefore confirmed the
influence of the buffer layer on the microstructure of AZO films deposited
using DC–MS. During film deposition on the buffer layer, the
adatoms on the deposition surface with excess free energy become incorporated
into the hexagonal arrays of Zn and O in the buffer layer. Thus, the
buffer layer suppresses the movement of these adatoms with excess
free energy to the grain boundaries, resulting in a preferential (0001)
orientation and reducing the residual compressive stress in the film.

Figure 7 shows EPMA spectra of 500-nm-thick AZO films
with and without a buffer layer at substrate positions of 0.5 and
6.5 cm as a function of photon energy. The upper and lower spectra
correspond to substrate positions of 0.5 and 6.5 cm, respectively.
The predominant peak at a photon energy of 2.88 keV corresponds to
the third-order Zn Kα line at 8.63 keV, whereas the peak at
a photon energy of 2.96 keV corresponds to the Ar Kα line.41

Figure 7 EPMA spectra of AZO films with and without the buffer
layer at
substrate positions of 0.5 and 6.5 cm as a function of photon energy.

The intensity of the signal corresponding to Ar
atoms from the
inert deposition gas was strongly dependent on the substrate position,
whereas the presence or absence of the buffer layer had little effect
on the peak intensity. Figure 7 clearly shows that the intensity of the peak corresponding
to Ar atoms was higher for the substrate position of 0.5 cm than that
for the substrate position of 6.5 cm located farther away from the
erosion zone of the target.20,47−49 To semiquantitatively estimate the content of retained Ar atoms
in the films, we calculated the ratios of Ar Kα/Zn Kα
area intensity, and the results are presented in Table 2. At the substrate position
of 0.5 cm, the Ar Kα/Zn Kα ratios for the AZO films with
and without the buffer layer were 0.19 and 0.12, respectively. On
the other hand, at the substrate position of 6.5 cm, the ratios with
and without the buffer layer were considerably lower at 0.08 and 0.06,
respectively. These findings imply the fact that introduction of Ar
atoms primarily results from backscattering perpendicular to the target
in the erosion zone, while the sputtered flux is distributed angularly.20 It should be noted that the content of residual
Ar atoms in AZO films with the buffer layer was on the same level
with the case of without the buffer layer, although it even had columnar
grains with the highly preferential c-axis orientation
owing to the well-defined (0001) orientation. The above finding implies
that the flying fluxes of recoiling Ar-related species are mainly
incorporated in-grain.

We conducted
PL measurements to investigate the quality of the
polycrystalline AZO films.50 In general,
the PL spectra of ZnO-based films contain two bands, namely, near-band-edge
(NBE) emission in the ultraviolet region and defect-related deep-level
(DL) emissions in the visible region. For the PL measurements, we
used quartz glass as the substrate because the PL spectra of AZO films
on alkali-free glass substrates were dominated by bands originating
from the substrate. We observed little difference in the structural,
electrical, and optical properties between AZO films deposited on
quartz and alkali-free glass substrates. Figure 8 shows representative PL spectra of AZO films
with and without a buffer layer at substrate positions of 0.5 and
6.5 cm as a function of wavelength. The upper and lower spectra correspond
to substrate positions of 0.5 and 6.5 cm, respectively. The NBE emission
band at a wavelength of approximately 350 nm dominated the PL spectra
of all of the AZO films,51,52 with some oscillations,
and only a very weak peak corresponding to DL emission was observed
in the wavelength range of 450–600 nm. These oscillations are
probably attributable to the film thickness.53 The DL emission can be ascribed to various types of intrinsic point
defects,52,54−60 such as oxygen vacancies,54 oxygen antisites,55 oxygen located at interstitial sites,56−60 Zn located at interstitial sites,59 and
Zn vacancies.60 A point to be noted here
is that all samples exhibited a DL emission intensity with little
strength. It means a low density of the intrinsic defect, assuming
that the presence of intrinsic point defects of the films is observed
as DL emission in the visible wavelength range. Bikowski et al. reported
the maximum of the ρ, lc expansion
and the minimum of the crystallite size for AZO films grown at the
area of the substrate opposite to the erosion zone of the target,
where the maximum of the flux of the high-energy electronegative-oxygen
(O–) ions was observed with the plasma process monitor.15 They explained the above findings thorough the
ion-energy-dependent dynamic equilibrium between the formation of
oxygen interstitials (Oi), resulting in an increase in lc, and the compensation of carrier electrons
donated by donors.61 In this study, there
is no evidence of the degradation of the properties owing to the damage
caused by high-energy O– ions, even for AZO films
deposited at substrate positions opposite to the erosion zone. Therefore,
we focus on the discussion about the effects of the remaining Ar on
the properties.

Figure 8 PL spectra of AZO films with and without the buffer layer
at substrate
positions of 0.5 and 6.5 cm as a function of wavelength.

The intensity of the NBE emission of the AZO films was strongly
dependent on the substrate position. As shown in Figure 8, the NBE emission intensity
was considerably higher for the substrate position of 6.5 cm than
that for the substrate position of 0.5 cm opposite to the erosion
zone of the target. This observation suggests that the AZO films should
possess a very high density of nonradiative defects at the substrate
position of 0.5 cm compared to that at the substrate position of 6.5
cm. Nonradiative recombination centers can originate from numerous
sources, such as dislocations, point defects, surface states, and,
in particular, interface states in the grain boundaries of polycrystalline
films. The intensity of the NBE photoluminescent area and the amount
of residual Ar atoms were determined; thus, the residual Ar atoms
induce the generation of crystallographic defects in the films, which
is expected to be a dominant factor limiting the density of nonradiative
recombination centers.20 We also observed
a small increase in the NBE emission intensity for the AZO films with
the buffer layer relative to those without the buffer layer at the
same substrate position. Taking into account the fact that AZO films
with the buffer layer exhibit improved flatness and crystallinity
compared to that of buffer-layer-free AZO films, it can be explained
by a decrease in the additional surface states owing to the adsorption
of carbon-related gases at the surface of the in-grains and in Al-related
precipitates at the surface of grain boundaries.

Electronic
Structure
Figure 9a,b shows valence band (VB) spectra and Fermi-level
region spectra of 500-nm-thick AZO films with and without a buffer
layer at substrate positions of 0.5 cm and of 500-nm-thick AZO films
with the buffer layer at a substrate position of 6.5 cm, respectively.
These spectra have been normalized to the Zn 3d peak
intensity. From Figure 9b, the density of states (DOS) can be observed in the Fermi-level
region for all films. The DOS intensity of AZO films slightly increased
by inserting a buffer layer and then drastically increased farther
away from the erosion zone of the target. These differences of DOS
intensity can be explained by those of N whose values
will be discussed in next section.

Figure 9 (a) VB spectra and (b) Fermi-level region
spectra of AZO films
with and without the buffer layer at a substrate position of
0.5 cm and AZO films with the buffer layer at a substrate position
of 6.5 cm.

In Figure 9a, two
groups can be observed in the VB: (1) From 10 to 14 eV, there are
bands with a strong d character, originating mostly
from d states at Zn sites. (2) For the upper valence
band located above approximately 8 eV, O p states
are
dominant. In the energy region from 5 eV to the valence band maximum,
the states exhibit complex behavior, namely, they consist of the bonding
states between O p and another Zn set of 4px, py, and pz with T2 symmetry and the antibonding
states between O p and the 3d set
with T2 symmetry.62−64 For Figure 9a, subpeak structure
at about 4.8 eV in VB spectra is clearly observed from AZO films with
a buffer layer, compared with buffer-layer-free AZO films. The appearance
of the subpeak is considered as a fingerprint of the Zn-polar surface
of ZnO, whereas its absence suggests the existence of an O-polar surface
of ZnO.38,65−67 The appearance of the
subpeak also depends on the plasmon excitation scattering from the
electrons in the conduction band.68 Taking
into account that a subpeak can be similarly observed in AZO films
with a buffer layer despite the fact that N is different
at each substrate positions, buffer-layer-free AZO films may be different
in polarity from AZO films with a buffer layer. It should be noted
that the electrical and optical properties and σa of AZO films with a buffer layer were strongly dependent on the
substrate position, whereas the VB spectra were identical at any given
substrate position. This finding suggests that degradation of the
electrical and optical properties occurs in deep parts that cannot
be probed by HAXPES.

Electrical Properties and Carrier Transport
Finally,
to clarify the influence of the buffer layer on the electrical properties
of AZO films at different substrate positions, we examined the electrical
properties and carrier transport characteristics. Table 2 summarizes the determined values
of ρ, N, and μH for the AZO
films with and without buffer layers at substrate positions of 0.5
and 6.5 cm. Taking into account the fact that the buffer layer thickness
was only 10 nm and the total sample thickness was 500 nm, the following
discussion is based on a single-layer model. Table 2 also shows the values of V(0001), Ar Kα/Zn Kα area intensity ratio,
and σa determined for the AZO films. The results
demonstrate that the presence of the buffer layer effectively enhanced
both N and μH, thereby reducing
the value of ρ compared to that of buffer-layer-free AZO films,
irrespective of the substrate position. These effects of the buffer
layer were more pronounced at the substrate position of 0.5 cm opposite
to the erosion zone of the target.

The performance of the TCO
material, figure of merit (Φ), can be determined from the sheet
resistance (Rs) and T using Haacke’s relation as follows:69 Φ = (Tav/100)10/ Rs, where Tav is
the optical average transmittance in the wavelength range from 400
to 700 nm. According to the definition, a high value of Φ corresponds
to a high performance of TCO. Rs, Tav, and Φ of AZO films in this study are
summarized in Table 2. It clearly shows very high Φ of about 42 × 10–3 Ω–1 of AZO films with buffer layers deposited
at a substrate position of 6.5 cm compared with the previous literature
data of ITO films of 28.66 × 10–3 Ω–1,70 Nb-doped TiO2 films of 5.6 × 10–5 Ω–1,71 and La-doped BaSnO3 films
of 5 × 10–3 Ω–1.72

To obtain a better understanding of the
enhanced μH in the presence of the buffer layer,
we calculated the optical mobility
(μopt) and the ratio of μopt to
the carrier mobility at the grain boundaries (μGB). The ratio μopt/μGB is an important
parameter for quantifying the degree of the contribution of grain-boundary
scattering to carrier transport.20,30,32−34,39,73 In this study, we take μopt as the in-grain carrier mobility. μopt was calculated
on the basis of the Drude theory20,30,32−34,39,73 using the experimental data for Ψ
and Δ determined from the spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements
combined with the experimental data for T and R determined from the spectrophotometric measurements. Further
details can be found in previous studies.20,30,32−34,39,73

The obtained values of
μopt and μopt/μGB are also presented in Table 2. The AZO film with the buffer layer at a
substrate position of 0.5 cm exhibited a μopt of
28.4 cm2/(Vs) and a μopt/μGB of 0.04, leading to a slightly reduced μH of 27.3
cm2/(Vs) owing to the small contribution of grain-boundary
scattering to carrier transport. The buffer-layer-free AZO film at
the same substrate position exhibited a similar μopt of 29.0 cm2/(Vs) but a considerably higher μopt/μGB of 1.03 and therefore a substantially
lower μH of 14.3 cm2/(Vs). These results
provide an important insight into the effect of the buffer layer from
the viewpoint of the structural properties. In our previous studies,
we found that AZO films possessing textures with complex orientations
such as (101̅0), (112̅2), and (112̅4) exhibited
high values of μopt/μGB and μH values that were lower than μopt.20,30,32−34,39,73 To obtain AZO films
with high μH, a specific orientation of the crystallites
is a key factor. We have found an important relationship between V(0001) and μopt/μGB; increasing V(0001) leads to
a reduction in μopt/μGB.

This
study has elucidated the other factors limiting the electrical
properties of AZO films deposited using DC–MS. These factors
include the retained Ar and residual stress in the films. As shown
in Table 2, the AZO
films with the buffer layer at a substrate position of 0.5 cm exhibited
a μH of 27.3 cm2/(Vs) with an N of 4.93 × 1020 cm–3,
whereas those at a substrate position of 6.5 cm displayed a μH of 41.3 cm2/(Vs) with an N of
7.23 × 1020 cm–3. Although both
of these AZO films possessed a texture with a well-defined (0001)
orientation and small-angle grain boundaries, i.e., excellent alignment
between the columnar grains, they contained distinctly different amounts
of retained Ar and residual stress. As shown in Table 2, similar findings were observed for the
buffer-layer-free AZO films. Future studies on other possible factors,
such as Ar incorporated in the grains and residual stress including
both compressive and tensile stress, are required to further build
on the results of this study and our previous studies.20,30,32−34,39,73

Conclusions
In this work, we investigated the effects of inserting a very thin
buffer layer on the film deposition and structural and electrical
properties of polycrystalline DC-magnetron-sputtered AZO films grown
on glass substrates at positions in the area opposite to the erosion
zone of the target and farther away from this area. We have demonstrated
that the use of a 10-nm-thick buffer layer deposited via DC arc discharge
IP led to AZO films possessing a texture with a specific well-defined
(0001) orientation, effectively improving the crystallographic orientation
of the AZO films irrespective of the substrate position. The AZO films
grown on the buffer layer exhibited V(0001) values exceeding 99% at both substrate positions. Consequently,
these films displayed a marked reduction in the contribution of grain-boundary
scattering to the carrier transport, affording a μopt/μGB ratio of less than 0.04, whereas we observed
no effect on the intrinsic carrier transport μopt. These findings indicate that the Ar-related obstacles to carrier
transport were mainly present in the in-grains. The results of this
study clearly indicate that technologies for producing AZO films with
a high carrier transport must afford a significant decrease in the
amount of Ar incorporated in the in-grains.
