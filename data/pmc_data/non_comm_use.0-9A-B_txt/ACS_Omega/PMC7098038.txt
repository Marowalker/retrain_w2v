This study describes the solvent
and catalyst-free Ugi reaction
by way of twin screw extrusion (TSE). Multicomponent chemical synthesis
can be converted into a single process without repeated use of solvents
through TSE. High synthetic yields are achieved in short reaction
times and produced in solvent-free conditions, which lead to a more
environmentally friendly process.

Introduction
Mechanochemistry can be used to speed
up chemical reactions while
eliminating and reducing the use of solvents, thereby making chemical
synthesis less hazardous and comparatively inexpensive.1 Mechanochemistry has made significant headway
in the field of synthetic chemistry in the last few years, with ever-increasing
research activities and the implementation of improved steps and methods
for future applications.2,3

Mortar and pestle
are being used in grinding and remain an efficient
mechanochemical method that is used for the synthesis of chemical
compounds.4,5 However, mechanical milling provides appreciably
greater energy and is a more reliable and sophisticated choice in
contrast to hand grinding. This is for the reason that the latter
may deliver economic benefits for various experimental results due
to its dependence on the grinding power and velocity of the operator.
Recently, mechanochemical strategies have made significant progress
in comparison to their humble beginnings and now consist of the use
of planetary or vibrational ball mills and even extruders. Ball mills
have been successfully applied in a range of organic synthetic yields,
specifically C–C, C–N, C–O, and C–X bond
formation,6−8 heterocycle synthesis,9−12 and even the synthesis of peptides,13,14 organic reactions, and metal-catalyzed reactions.15,16

Extrusion is used to describe a set of techniques that involve
the transport of compound via a restricted space. Consequently, shear
and forces of pressure are applied to the material, which, in turn,
can stimulate and complete the chemical reaction.17 Initially, Paradkar et al. reported on the use of extraction
with hot melt for the preparation of cocrystals.18 Subsequently, TSE was used for the production of organic
metal structures19 and deep eutectic solvents.20 Owing to the advantages indicated concerning
the use of TSE for the preparation of high-quality materials, in most
cases, the products did not require purification after the process.

It should be noted that the reactions conducted on the ball mills
lack temperature control and scalability. However, this can be overcome
with the use of TSE. Chemical reactions such as aldol condensations,
Michael reactions, Biginelli reaction, imine formation reactions,
Knoevenagel condensations, molecular organic structures, papain-catalyzed
oligopeptide, and even multicomponent and multistep reactions have
been successfully undertaken by means of TSE.21−23

Multicomponent
reactions (MCRs) is a green protocol that works
by collecting molecules with great diversity, which are generated
with a minimal synthetic effort, time, and the formation of by-products,24,25 wherein three or more compounds begin to react to each other to
form a single new product, which has all the atoms of the starting
compounds.

In recent years, we have worked constantly on the
development of
new tools and methodologies for bioactive compounds synthesized using
green methodologies.26−28

In the present work, we describe a simple and
excellent performance
protocol for the synthesis of the Ugi reaction of four components
in one pot by means of TSE without a catalyst and solvent.

Materials
and Methods
General Procedure for Synthetic Ugi Reaction by Solvent-Free
Twin Screw Extrusion
A mixture of aldehyde (0.2 mol), aromatic
amine (0.2 mol), aromatic acid (0.2 mol), and isocyanide (0.2 moles)
was taken in a glass mortar and gently mixed to ensure that the liquid
reagents are adsorbed on solid compounds. The mixture was introduced
manually into the extruder hopper. The extrusion was performed at
various screw speeds in co-rotational mode and at different temperatures
with the aim of optimizing the reaction. Care was taken to avoid overfilling
the barrel. The extruded product was subsequently stirred while adding
ice to the reaction, and the precipitated product was filtered using
a vacuum pump. The precipitate was then washed with cold water, dried
under vacuum, and recrystallized from ethanol to give the pure products.

The extruder employed in this study was a LechTech Scientific 26
mm twin screw extruder. The screws have a diameter of 26 mm and an
L/D ratio of 40:1.

All the products are reported in the literature.29,30 The 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra were recorded
on a 400 MHz Bruker using TMS as the internal reference and CDCl3 as the solvent. Purity of a compound can be determined by
TLC checking.

Results and Discussion
The Ugi reaction
is one of the most significant multicomponent
reactions among aldehydes 1, amines 2, aromatic
acid 3, and isocyanides 4, prompting us
to study a new method such as mechanochemical reactions by means of
TSE that gave products 5a–5i. We
examined the influence of different (polar and nonpolar) solvents
on the performance of this reaction. The results are presented in Table 1. Water was the best
among the solvents tested, in view of the fact that it supplied product 5a with a yield of 66% (Table 1, entry 1).

a Reaction conditions: benzaldehyde
(1a, 0.5 mmol), aniline (2a, 0.5 mmol),
benzoic acid (3a, 0.5 mmol), and tert-butyl isocyanide (4a, 0.5 mmol) gave isolated yields
of 5a.

The
reactions conducted in MeOH, EtOH, acetonitrile, DMF (N,N-dimethyl formamide), DCM (dichloromethane),
benzene, and CCl4 (carbon tetrachloride) gave the yields
of the appropriate products (Table 1, entries 2–8). The reaction was conducted without
a solvent at room temperature (Table 1, entry 9) to establish the reference yields, with
which it was possible to compare the yields obtained using our new
process. As the temperature of the data obtained increased, it became
evident that the best yields were attained in solvent-free conditions
(Table 1, entries 10–12).
We also sought to perform the reaction at temperatures above 100 °C;
we noticed that a dark solid product was obtained. This is assumed
to be caused by thermal degradation.

We then undertook reference
reaction 5a (Scheme 1) by means of the
mechanochemical method (TSE), primarily based on the hypothesis that
the shear and compression of the reaction mass carried out between
the screws would resolve the problem of bad mixing noticed in the
batch reaction and therefore lead to higher product yields. In addition,
in accordance with Le Chatelier’s principle of equilibrium,
water obtained as a by-product of the Ugi reaction will evaporate
during the extrusion process that caused the reaction to take place.

Scheme 1 Solvent- and Catalyst-Free Ugi Reaction 5a–5i by Means of Twin Screw Extrusion
The reagent mixture was initially introduced into the extruder,
and the extrusion was performed at 60 rpm and at room temperature
(see Table 2). However,
it was observed that the product only produced a low yield. Consequently,
we started to increase the barrel temperature to 100 °C, at which
point we achieved a 90% yield (Table 2, entry 5).

a Isolated yield.

This made us change the speed of the screw to assess
its effect
on product performance. At the optimal temperature of 100 °C,
it was established that, by decreasing the speed of the screw, the
total yield obtained would decrease (Table 2, entry 6) due to the lack of sufficient
rotation and mixing. A higher screw speed also signifies that the
reaction mixture remained in contact with the heated cylinder and
was then exposed to high temperatures for a shorter time, thus giving
submaximal yields (Table 2, entry 5). The optimal speed of the screw was 50 rpm (rounds
per minute). At this rpm, the residence time was 15–20 min
approximately. Therefore, it was determined that the magnitude and
efficiency of the mixture with sufficient time at an elevated temperature
had a direct influence on the yields of the product.

Subsequently,
we also evaluated the substrate range for this process
by using different aldehydes, amines, acids, and isocyanides to obtain
Ugi products (Scheme 1). The reactions were performed using the optimum temperature and
the speed of the screw obtained from previous reactions (Table 2, entry 7). From the
data obtained, it can be concluded that the nature of the substituent
does not have a significant effect on the product’s yield when
the twin screw extruder is employed. The yields obtained by extrusion
were also significantly higher than those achieved by means of the
normal reaction without the corresponding solvent.

Conclusions
We have shown that multicomponent chemical synthesis can be converted
into a continuous solvent-free process by using twin screw extrusion
(TSE). The Ugi reaction was successfully performed in solvent-free
conditions by using TSE. The yields obtained were higher than those
attained with the classical techniques. Not only higher yields were
obtained for the products, but also higher purity was achieved than
those produced with the aforementioned methods. Therefore, it required
less purification. This study reported an environmentally friendly
process with a very short reaction time for organic synthesis.
