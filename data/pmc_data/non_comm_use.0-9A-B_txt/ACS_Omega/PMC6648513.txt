Novel
AgI/Ag2Mo2O7 heterojunctions
were prepared by reacting Ag2Mo2O7 microrods with an aqueous KI solution at room temperature. The composite
materials, compared with neat AgI and Ag2Mo2O7, showed much higher activities in the photocatalytic
degradation of aqueous rhodamine B, methyl orange, tetracycline hydrochloride,
and levofloxacin solutions under visible-light irradiation. The structures,
morphologies, and other physicochemical properties of AgI, Ag2Mo2O7, and AgI/Ag2Mo2O7 composites were studied via various characterization
techniques. The active species involved in the photocatalytic process
were examined via radical-capturing experiments and electron spin
resonance. Superoxide anion radicals (•O2–) and photogenerated holes (h+) were
found to be the main active species. Photocatalytic mechanisms were
proposed and reasons for the enhanced photocatalytic activity were
explained.

1 Introduction
Heterogeneous
catalysis plays a key role in removing environmental
pollutants in waste gases, indoor air, or waste water, whereas photocatalysis
by semiconductors is a key branch of environmental catalysis research.1−3 TiO2, the benchmark photocatalyst, relies heavily on
ultraviolet (UV) light that occupies only a very small portion of
the sun light. To make full use of visible light that represents a
lion share of sunlight, novel visible-light responsive photocatalysts
are especially needed.

There are many types of visible-light-responsive
photocatalysts.
In particular, Ag-containing compounds such as AgX (X = Cl, Br, or
I),4 Ag2O,5 Ag3VO4,6 Ag2CO3,7 Ag3PO4,8 Ag2CrO4,9 and Ag2MoO410 have attracted much attention.11 Among these Ag-containing photocatalysts, Ag2MoO4 has aroused great interest due to its electronic
structure and photoluminescence (PL) properties.12 However, the wide band gap (∼3.2 eV) and the low
photocatalytic efficiency of Ag2MoO413 have hindered its practical application in photocatalysis.
Thus, Ag2MoO4 has been coupled with other substances
to form heterojunctions such as Ag2MoO4/g-C3N4,14,15 Ag3PO4/Ag2MoO4,16,17 Fe3O4–C3N4–Ag2MoO4,18 g-C3N4/Ag3PO4/Ag2MoO4,19 Ag2MoO4/Bi2MoO6,20 Ag2MoO4/Ag/AgBr/GO,21 AgBr/Ag2MoO4,22,23 AgI/Ag2MoO4,24 Ag2MoO4/AgBr/Ag,25−27 and Ag/AgCl/Ag2MoO4.28

Ag2Mo2O7, a new Ag–Mo–O
material with a crystal structure linked as chains, was found to possess
a narrower band gap of 2.65 eV and a higher optical absorption ability.29,30 Ag2Mo2O7 materials with various
morphologies (such as nanowires,30−33 nanoparticles,34 flower-like,35 broom-like microstructures,35 and microrods36−38) have been reported.
Nevertheless, there are only a few studies on Ag2Mo2O7-based heterojunctions such as AgO/Ag2Mo2O7,39 g-C3N4/m-Ag2Mo2O7,40 Ag2Mo2O7@AgBr–Ag,41 and Ag3PO4/Ag/Ag2Mo2O7.42

AgI,
with excellent visible-light response and good photocatalytic
degradation activity,43,44 has been used to construct heterojunction
photocatalysts such as Ag3VO4/AgI,45,46 Ag2O/AgI,47 Ag2WO4/AgI,48 AgI/g-C3N4,49 AgI/Bi2MoO6,50 AgI/BiVO4,51 AgI/BiOBr,52 and
AgI/BiOCOOH.53 However, to the best of
our knowledge, AgI/Ag2Mo2O7 has not
been reported.

Herein, Ag2Mo2O7 microrods were
prepared via a facile hydrothermal process,36 and AgI particles were then deposited onto Ag2Mo2O7 surfaces via treating Ag2Mo2O7 in an aqueous KI solution (Scheme 1). Similar treatment processes were used
to prepare Ag2Mo2O7@AgBr–Ag
by reacting Ag2Mo2O7 with an aqueous
NaBr solution41 and AgI/AgVO3 by reacting AgVO3 with an aqueous KI solution.45 Interestingly, AgI/Ag2Mo2O7 showed a much higher photocatalytic activity than neat
AgI and Ag2Mo2O7. The materials were
characterized and tested in visible-light-driven photocatalysis. Possible
photocatalytic mechanisms were proposed.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization
of the Samples
Figure 1 shows the X-ray
diffraction (XRD) patterns of AgI, Ag2Mo2O7, and S5. The XRD patterns of pure AgI and Ag2Mo2O7 are consistent with the standard XRD data of
hexagonal phase AgI (JCPDS No. 09-0374) and monoclinic phase Ag2Mo2O7 (ICSD No. 15-4826), respectively.
Compared with pure Ag2Mo2O7, S5 shows
distinctive peaks at 2θ = 22.3, 23.7, 25.4, 32.8, 39.2, 42.7,
and 46.3°, corresponding to the (100), (002), (101), (102), (110),
(103), and (112) planes of hexagonal AgI, respectively. The data mean
that S5 contains both Ag2Mo2O7 and
AgI. Moreover, with the increasing AgI contents in AgI/Ag2Mo2O7 (S1–S5), the intensity of the
AgI peaks enhances gradually, whereas the intensity of the Ag2Mo2O7 peaks becomes weaker (Figure S1). No impurity phases are detected.

Figure 1 XRD patterns
of AgI, S5, and Ag2Mo2O7. Standard
XRD patterns of AgI (JCPDS No. 09-0374) and Ag2Mo2O7 (ICSD No. 15-4826) are also shown.

The compositions and chemical status of the as-prepared catalysts
were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The XPS survey
scan spectrum in Figure S2 reveals that
S5 contains Ag, I, Mo, O, and adventitious C. The peak position of
C 1s at 284.6 eV is used to calibrate the position of other elements.
The high-resolution XPS scan spectra of Ag 3d, I 3d, Mo 3d, and O
1s are exhibited in Figure 2. For S5, the element Ag is present in the form of Ag+, corresponding to the binding energies of 373.8 and 367.8
eV for Ag 3d3/2 and Ag 3d5/2, respectively. Figure 2b shows two peaks
at 619.6 eV (I 3d5/2) and 631.0 eV (I 3d3/2)
attributed to I– in S5. Two distinct peaks at 232.1
and 235.3 eV (corresponding to Mo6+) are seen in the Mo
3d high-resolution spectra (Figure 2c). As shown in Figure 2d, the high-resolution O 1s peak of S5 is deconvoluted
into three peaks at binding energies of 530.2, 531.5, and 533.3 eV,
corresponding to Mo–O–Mo bonds,39 oxygen vacancy,54 and adsorbed oxygen
on the surface55 of the sample, respectively.
Notably, Ag 3d and I 3d peaks in S5 move to a positive position compared
with those in AgI, whereas the peak of Mo 3d in S5 shifts slightly
to lower binding energies compared with that in Ag2Mo2O7. All the shifts in the XPS spectra can be ascribed
to the intense interaction between closely contacted phases of AgI
and Ag2Mo2O7.56

Figure 2 High-resolution XPS data of Ag 3d (a), I 3d (b), Mo 3d (c), and
O 1s (d).

Figure 3 depicts
the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of Ag2Mo2O7, AgI, and S5. Pure Ag2Mo2O7 shows a microrod morphology with a mean diameter of
1–2 μm (Figure 3a,b), whereas pure AgI consists of many irregular particles
with sizes of about 10 μm (Figure 3c,d). For S5 (Figure 3e,f), the Ag2Mo2O7 microrods are decorated by numerous AgI particles with a
grain size of about 100 nm. The reason for the difference seen in
the sizes of pure AgI and AgI particles on Ag2Mo2O7 microrods is that pure AgI is formed by direct precipitation
in the solution (the growth of AgI crystal is out of control), whereas
AgI/Ag2Mo2O7 is produced by reaction
between Ag2Mo2O7 microrods and aqueous
KI at the liquid–solid interface (this conversion is supposed
to be more difficult). As seen from Figure S3, the amount of AgI particles assembled on the surface of Ag2Mo2O7 increases with enhanced content
of AgI (Figure S3). The energy-dispersive
spectrometry (EDS) result in Figure S4 also
indicates the coexistence of Ag, I, Mo, and O elements in S5. The
molar percentage of I element is shown to be 21.4%, in line with the
theoretical content of 21.1%.

Figure 3 SEM images of (a, b) Ag2Mo2O7,
(c, d) AgI, and (e, f) S5.

The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms
of Ag2Mo2O7, AgI, and S5 were measured.
In Figure S5, S5 shows the isotherms of
type IV
with a type H3 hysteresis loop (based on IUPAC classification) at
high relative pressures (p/p0) between 0.85 and 1.0, suggesting the presence of aggregation
voids between the particles.57 For comparison,
Ag2Mo2O7 and AgI exhibit type II
isotherms without a significant hysteresis loop, indicating there
are no pores in Ag2Mo2O7 and AgI.58 The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)
surface areas of Ag2Mo2O7, AgI, and
S1–S5 are 1.43, 0.93, 1.87, 2.07, 4.31, 5.86, and 5.89 m2/g, respectively. Among them, S5 shows the highest BET surface
areas.

Figure 4 shows the
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results of Ag2Mo2O7, AgI, and S5. Compared with the pure Ag2Mo2O7 microrod (Figure 4a), the surface of S5 (Figure 4c) becomes rougher due to some small bulges
observed at the microrod surface, which can be recognized as AgI particles,
in line with the SEM images (Figure 3). The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of S5 is presented
in Figure 4d. The lattice
fringes of 0.398 and 0.373 nm correspond to the (100) and (002) lattice
planes of AgI, whereas the lattice fringes of 0.321 and 0.286 nm are
attributed to the (022) and (200) lattice planes of Ag2Mo2O7. The results prove the formation of a
heterojunction structure in S5.

Figure 4 TEM images (b) of Ag2Mo2O7 (a),
AgI (b), S5 (c) and HRTEM of S5 (d).

The distribution of elements in S5 was demonstrated by scanning
transmission electron microscopy (STEM)–energy-dispersive X-ray
(EDX) elemental mapping. As shown in Figure 5, the Ag, Mo, and I elements are all uniformly
distributed in S5. In particular, the distribution of I element is
wider than that of the Mo element, indicating that the Ag2Mo2O7 microrod is well covered by AgI particles,
consistent with the SEM (Figure 3) and TEM (Figure 4) observations.

Figure 5 STEM and EDX elemental mapping images
of S5.

The optimal properties of the
samples were investigated by UV–vis
diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (Figure 6a). Pure Ag2Mo2O7 and AgI present a broad absorbance in both ultraviolet and
visible-light ranges. The optical absorption edges of pure Ag2Mo2O7 and AgI are located at 455 and
440 nm, respectively. S5 exhibits light absorption edges between 455
and 440 nm. This result indicates that all of the photocatalysts possess
visible-light response. However, the light absorption ability of the
samples (above 450 nm) clearly follows the sequence of Ag2Mo2O7 > S5 > AgI. In addition, the optical
absorption edges of AgI/Ag2Mo2O7 show
a slight red shift with the increasing content of AgI (Figure S6).

spectra of Ag2Mo2O7, AgI, and S5.
(b) A plot of (αhν)1/2 versus
the band gap energy (eV)
for Ag2Mo2O7. A plot of (αhν)2 versus the band gap energy (eV) for
AgI.

The band gap energies (Eg) of pure
Ag2Mo2O7 and AgI are calculated according
to the following equation41 1  where α, A, hν, and Eg are the absorption
coefficient, proportionality constant, photon energy, and band gap
energy, respectively. The value of index n is determined
by the type of optical transition of semiconductors; n equals to 1 for the direct transition and 4 for the indirect transition
of photocatalysts. The optical transition of AgI is direct,24 and the Eg of AgI
is estimated from the plot of (αhν)2 versus the photon energy (hν) to be
2.82 eV. Ag2Mo2O7 is an indirect
semiconductor,40 so the value of n is 4 and the Eg is measured
to be 2.68 eV (Figure 6b).

The conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) positions
can be
determined through the following empirical equations41 2   3  where EVB is the
VB edge potential and X is the absolute electronegativity
of the semiconductor. The X values for Ag2Mo2O7 and AgI are 6.08 V40 and 5.48 V,45 respectively. E0 is the energy of free electrons on the hydrogen
scale, with the value of 4.5 V,59 and Eg is the band gap energy of the semiconductor.
The EVB values of Ag2Mo2O7 and AgI are calculated to be 2.92 and 2.39 V
vs normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), and the corresponding ECB values are calculated to be 0.24 and −0.42
V vs NHE, respectively.

2.2 Photocatalytic Activities
of Samples
The photocatalytic activities of the samples were
first measured
by degrading aqueous solution of methyl orange (MO) under visible-light
irradiation. Figure 7a shows the variations of MO concentration (C/C0) versus irradiation time, where C0 and C are the initial concentration
and concentration at reaction time t, respectively.
The degradation of MO is negligible in the absence of a photocatalyst.
Both Ag2Mo2O7 and AgI show poor photocatalytic
performance, i.e., only 7.6% and 3.3% of MO can be degraded within
90 min, respectively. AgI/Ag2Mo2O7 composites exhibit superior photocatalytic activities, and the degradation
efficiencies of MO increase gradually with the growing AgI content.
Among these composite photocatalysts, S5 exhibits the highest degradation
efficiency of 80% after 90 min irradiation. S5 also displays a higher
photocatalytic activity in the degradation of MO than the optimal
photocatalyst of Ag/AgCl/Ag2MoO4 reported in
our previous study28 (Figure S7). Figure 7b shows the time-dependent UV–vis spectra of MO (10
mg/L) on S5. It can be seen that the absorption peak of MO decreases
with the prolongation of irradiation time, and characteristic absorption
peak at around 464 nm of MO almost disappear after irradiation for
90 min. The total organic carbon (TOC) analysis indicates that there
is no decrease in the TOC value after reaction for 90 min (with respect
to the TOC value of the fresh MO solution), indicating that MO is
degraded, by using S4, into colorless organic products.

Figure 7 (a) Adsorption
and visible-light-degradation curves of MO (10 mg/L)
without a photocatalyst and in the presence of catalysts. (b) Time-dependent
UV–vis spectra of MO solution for S5. Here C/C0 values were determined by the intensity
of the absorption peak at 464 nm.

The corresponding pseudo-first-order rate constant (k) can be calculated by the following equation: ln(C0/C) = kt,
where C0 and C are initial
concentration
and the concentration of rhodamine B (RhB) at irradiation time t, respectively. As shown in Figure S8, the reaction in the first 15 min of reaction is much faster
than the reaction afterward. In each stage, S5 is still the most active
catalyst.

The stability of S5 was investigated by a four-run
recycling experiments
under the same condition, and the result is displayed in Figure 8a (containing the
dark adsorption for 30 min). After four cycles, S5 still exhibits
high activity for the degradation of MO, and the MO degradation efficiency
is 77.6%, slightly dropping 2.5%, which may be attributed to the transformation
of Ag+ into Ag0 during the photocatalytic process.
The formation of Ag0 has been confirmed via XRD and XPS.
Compared to the fresh S5 (Figure 8b), the XRD pattern of the used S5 collected after
the cycling runs shows a weak peak located at 2θ = 38.1o, corresponding to the (111) facets of cubic Ag0 (JCPDS No. 040783). The XPS spectrum also shows two peaks of Ag0 located at 368.1 and 374.1 eV in S5 after four cycling runs
(Figure 8b,c). The
result is in accordance with the SEM–EDS result showing the
higher content of Ag after reaction (Figure S9).

for 30 min). (b) XRD patterns of S5 before and after four cycling
runs. (c) Survey XPS spectra. (d) Ag high-resolution XPS data of fresh
and used S5.

As for the photodegradation
of RhB, the results presented in Figure 9 depict a trend similar
to the trend seen in the degradation of MO, except that AgI is
more active than Ag2Mo2O7 in
this reaction. As seen in Figure 9a, the dye molecules’ capacity to adsorb S1–S5
composites in the dark is enhanced in turn due to the increased SBET. From the degradation curves of RhB (Figure 9b), it can be observed
that an obvious blue shift occurs with the decrease in the maximum
absorption peak. The phenomenon of the blue shift implies the de-ethylation
of RhB during its degradation process.60 The kinetics of the photocatalytic degradation of RhB are also fit
by the pseudo-first-order kinetics linear function model (Figure S10). S5 shows the highest photocatalytic
degradation rate (5.06 × 10–2 min–1), greatly higher than that of Ag2Mo2O7 (5.63 × 10–5 min–1) and AgI (7.25 × 10–3 min–1).

mg/L) without a photocatalyst and in the presence of catalysts. (b)
Time-dependent UV–vis spectra of RhB solution for S5. Here, C/C0 values were determined
by the intensity of the maximum absorption peak in the 490–548
nm region (not at a fixed wavelength).

The TOC value of the solution collected at 90 min irradiation
(by
using S5 as a catalyst) divided by the TOC value of the fresh RhB
solution is 59.6%, i.e., the TOC value decreases by 40.4%. The decrease
percentage is similar to the decrease in C/C0 value cased by dark adsorption (Figure 9a), implying that RhB is degraded
into colorless organic products using this catalyst upon light irradiation.

In addition, colorless organic compound of tetracycline hydrochloride
(TC, 20 mg/L) and levofloxacin (LEV, 20 mg/L) were also used to assess
the photocatalytic activity of the samples (Figure 10). Both AgI and Ag2Mo2O7 show poor removal efficiency in TC and LEV degradation.
The degradation efficiencies of TC and LEV are improved significantly
after coupling Ag2Mo2O7 with different
amounts of AgI, and S5 presents the highest degradation efficiencies
of 64.3% (TC) and 64.5% (LEV), respectively. Therefore, this result
can confirm the prominent photocatalytic performance of S5.

and visible-light-degradation curves of (a) TC (20 mg/L)
and (b) LEV (20 mg/L) without a photocatalyst and in the presence
of catalysts. Here, C/C0 values were determined by the intensity of the maximum absorption
peaks at 357 and 290 nm, respectively.

2.3 Photocatalytic Reaction Mechanism
Photoluminescence (PL) emission was employed to investigate the migration,
separation, and recombination of photoinduced charge carriers. A lower
PL emission peak intensity indicates a higher separation efficiency
of the photoexcited electron–hole pairs.29,61 As seen from the PL spectra of Ag2Mo2O7, AgI, and S5 in Figure 11a, both Ag2Mo2O7 and
AgI exhibit higher PL intensity, which implies the possibility of
a faster recombination of charge carriers. On the contrary, S5 displays
lower PL signals, suggesting that the recombination of the electrons
and holes is effectively restrained and the electron-transfer rate
is greatly facilitated.

Figure 11 (a) PL spectra and (b) electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy (EIS)
Nyquist plots of Ag2Mo2O7, AgI, and
S5.

To get further insight into the
charge-transfer process of the
samples, electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were recorded. As
illustrated in Figure 11b, the arc radius on the EIS Nyquist plot of S5 is considerably smaller
than that of Ag2Mo2O7 and AgI, validating
that S5 possesses a weaker charge-transfer resistance and a higher
photocatalytic activity,62 consistent with
the result of PL.

Radical-trapping experiments were implemented
on MO decomposition
of S5 via adding scavengers to capture the active species generated
during photocatalysis. Herein, p-benzoquinone (BQ,
0.02 mmol),63 ethylenediaminetetra-acetic
acid disodium salt (EDTA-2Na, 1 mmol),41 and isopropyl alcohol (IPA, 1 mmol)64 were used as scavengers for superoxide anion radicals (•O2–), photogenerated holes (h+), and hydroxyl radicals (•OH), respectively. As
shown in Figure 12, the MO degradation is significantly inhibited after the addition
of BQ, with the efficiency decreased from 80.0% (no scavenger) to
29.4% (in the presence of BQ), indicating that •O2– is the predominant active species
in the photocatalytic degradation process. When EDTA-2Na is introduced
to the reaction system, the MO degradation efficiency drops from 80.0%
(no scavenger) to 50.1% (in the presence of EDTA-2Na), suggesting
that h+ plays a secondary role. In regard to •OH, the degradation of MO is slightly suppressed after the addition
of IPA. Thus, hydroxyl radicals (•OH) are not actively
involved in the photocatalytic process. To summarize, •O2– and h+ are the mainly
active species in the photocatalysis.

Figure 12 Photodegradation of
MO solution under visible-light irradiation
in the presence of S5, without or with p-benzoquinone
(BQ), ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid disodium salt (EDTA-2Na), and
isopropyl alcohol (IPA).

The radical-capture experiments were also conducted on LEV
decomposition
using S5. As shown in Figure S11, the degradation
of LEV is greatly restrained after the addition of EDTA-2Na and slightly
hindered in the presence of IPA, suggesting the key role of h+ in the degradation process. The experiment using BQ does
not generate conclusive results due to the interference of the characteristic
absorption peak of LEV. This is also the case with TC (data not shown).

The existence of active species was further confirmed by electron
spin resonance (ESR) spin-trap techniques utilizing 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO, a spin-trapping reagent). Remarkably,
there are no signals in the dark, whereas intensive characteristic
signals can be detected under visible-light irradiation. As shown
in Figure 13a, four
strong characteristic peaks with intensities of 1:2:2:1 appear in
the aqueous dispersions of S5 under visible-light irradiation, as
attributed to the DMPO–•OH spin adducts,56 and the peak intensity is significantly stronger
than those of Ag2Mo2O7 and AgI. Meanwhile,
six characteristic peaks of DMPO–•O2– are also distinctly observed under visible-light
illumination (Figure 13b),65 and S5 shows the strongest peak
intensity among the three samples, in agreement with the enhanced
photocatalytic performance of S5. Overall, the ESR results demonstrate
that •O2– and •OH are generated during the photocatalytic degradation
process using S5. However, it should be mentioned that •OH is not relevant to photocatalytic degradation in this study according
to the redical-capture experiments (Figure 12) although it is indeed generated (Figure 13a).

Figure 13 DMPO spin-trapping
ESR spectra of Ag2Mo2O7, AgI, and
S5 (a) in aqueous dispersion for DMPO–•OH
and (b) in methanol dispersion for DMPO–•O2– in the dark and under
visible light for 5 min.

Two photocatalytic mechanisms are proposed and illustrated
in Figure 14. Both
Ag2Mo2O7 and AgI can respond to visible
light,
and photoinduced electrons can be excited to the conduction band (CB).
Since the CB edge of Ag2Mo2O7 (0.24
V) is more positive than that of AgI (−0.42 V), the excited
electrons (e–) will migrate from the CB of AgI to
the CB of Ag2Mo2O7, whereas the photogenerated
holes (h+) left behind will transfer from the VB of Ag2Mo2O7 to the VB of AgI (Figure 14a). However, due to the much
more positive edge potential of Ag2Mo2O7 (0.24 V) than the potential of O2/•O2– (−0.33 V),66 the electrons accumulated in the CB of Ag2Mo2O7 are unable to transform O2 to •O2–. Similarly, the transformed
holes also do not work in the system, owing to the lower oxidation
potential of AgI (2.39 V) than that of H2O/•OH (2.72 V).52 Thus, a Z-scheme mechanism
may be more reasonable. As shown in Figure 14b, the excited electrons in the CB of Ag2Mo2O7 combine with the holes in the
VB of AgI. Therefore, the preserved photoinduced electrons in the
CB of AgI with high reduction ability will reduce oxygen to produce •O2–, and the maintained
photogenerated holes in the VB of Ag2Mo2O7 with high oxidation ability can directly react with pollutants
to produce the degradation products. In general, the efficient Z-scheme
heterojunction can optimize the redox ability of photocatalysts and
lead to superior photocatalytic performance.67

and (b) Z-scheme heterojunction systems.

3 Conclusions
Rodlike AgI/Ag2Mo2O7 composites
with different molar ratios were fabricated via reacting Ag2Mo2O7 microrods with an aqueous KI solution.
The characterization results showed that AgI nanoparticles are evenly
distributed on the surface of Ag2Mo2O7 microrods, and heterostructures are formed. Compared with pristine
Ag2Mo2O7 and AgI, the resultant AgI/Ag2Mo2O7 heterojunctions displayed better
photocatalytic performance for the degradation of organic pollutants
under visible-light irradiation, and the optimized AgI/Ag2Mo2O7 molar ratio was 4:1. Good recyclability
was also obtained for the optimal AgI/Ag2Mo2O7 sample (S5) in the process of photodegradation. Superoxide
anion radicals (•O2–) and photogenerated holes (h+) were found to be the main
active species in the photocatalysis. A Z-scheme photocatalytic mechanism
was proposed.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
AgNO3, Na2MoO4·2H2O, KI, HNO3,
rhodamine B (RhB), and methyl orange (MO) of analytical grade were
purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent. Levofloxacin (LEV) and
tetracycline hydrochloride (TC) of analytical grade were obtained
from Aladdin. Deionized water was generated from Laboratory Water
Purification System (Master-Q30, HHitech).

4.2 Preparation
of Ag2Mo2O7 Microrods
Ag2Mo2O7 microrods were synthesized by
a facile hydrothermal method.36 In a typical
procedure, 1 mmol AgNO3 was dissolved in 40 mL deionized
water to form solution A and 0.5
mmol Na2MoO4·2H2O was dissolved
in 40 mL deionized water to form solution B. Then, solution A was
added into solution B dropwise under magnetic stirring (700 rpm) at
room temperature. Subsequently, the pH value of the mixture, monitored
by a pH meter, was adjusted to 2 using HNO3 solution (0.7
M), and the mixture was magnetically stirred for 30 min in the dark.
The resulting mixture was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless
autoclave of 100 mL capacity, heated to 150 °C for 12 h, and
then cooled down to room temperature. The precipitate was separated
by centrifugation and washed with deionized water. This centrifugation
and washing process was repeated several times. Finally, the product
was dried at 60 °C for 12 h.

4.3 Preparation
of AgI/Ag2Mo2O7 Composites
The obtained Ag2Mo2O7 powders (0.26
g) were dispersed in 100 mL deionized
water and treated in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min to allow for the
dispersion of Ag2Mo2O7 powders in
water. Then, a certain amount (0.11, 0.20, 0.33, 0.50, or 0.67 mmol)
of KI was dissolved in 40 mL deionized water, and the KI solution
was added dropwise under vigorous stirring (700 rpm). The suspension
turned yellow and was kept stirring for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently,
the obtained samples were washed with distilled water several times
and then dried at 60 °C for 12 h. The final AgI/Ag2Mo2O7 composites with different theoretical
AgI/Ag2Mo2O7 molar ratios of 1:4,
1:2, 1:1, 2:1, and 4:1 are denoted as S1, S2, S3, S4, and S5, respectively.
For comparison, pristine AgI was prepared by precipitation using 2
mmol AgNO3 and 2 mmol KI.

4.4 Characterization
X-ray diffraction
(XRD) experiments for determining the crystal phases were performed
using an X’Pert PRO MPD X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku, Japan)
using Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 30 mA. The scanning speed
was chosen to be 10° min–1. X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) measurements for analyzing the oxidation states
of elements were carried out on an ESCALAB 250XI photoelectron spectroscopy
instrument (Thermo Fisher). Scanning electron microscope (SEM) experiments
for characterizing the morphology of the samples were conducted on
an FESEM-4800 field emission scanning electron microscope. Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) experiments for observing the detailed structures
and morphologies of the samples were carried out by using a JEOL JEM-2100F
high-resolution transmission electron microscope. The Brunauere–Emmette–Teller
(BET) specific surface areas were measured by using an automatic surface
analyzer (Quantachrome). Optical diffuse-reflectance UV–vis
spectra were recorded on a U-3900H spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Japan).
Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained using an FLS1000 Evolution
instrument at an excitation wavelength of 355 nm (Edinburgh, England).
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to characterize
the sample on an electrochemical analyzer (CHI 1030B, Chenhua Instrument
Company). Electron spin resonance (ESR) data were acquired by a Bruker
A300 spectrometer. The signals of radicals •OH and •O2– were spin-trapped
by 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) dissolved
in H2O and absolute methanol, respectively.28

4.5 Photocatalytic Activity
Photocatalytic
degradation of rhodamine B (RhB, 10 mg/L), methyl orange (MO, 10 mg/L),
levofloxacin (LEV, 20 mg/L), and tetracycline hydrochloride (TC, 20
mg/L) was carried out under visible light generated by an Xe lamp
(300 W, HSX-F300, Beijing NBeT Technology Co., Ltd.) coupled with
a UV-cutoff filter (λ > 420 nm), as shown in Figure S12.28 Briefly,
30 mg photocatalysts
were dispersed in 50 mL contaminant solution (RhB, MO, LEV, or TC
solution) in a 100 mL beaker, and the distance between the solution
surface and the Xe lamp was 30 cm (Figure S1).

The suspension was stirred vigorously (700 rpm) in the dark
for 30 min to reach the adsorption–desorption equilibrium.
After that, visible-light irradiation was conducted. At given irradiation
time intervals, 3.5 mL of the suspension (containing the solution
and fine catalyst powers dispersed within) was sampled and then centrifuged
at a speed of 12 000 rpm for 20 min to separate the catalyst
powders and solution. The obtained supernatant (solution) was analyzed
by a UV-5200PC spectrometer by checking its characteristic absorbance
at maximum absorption wavelength. The TOC values of the liquid phases
were determined by a TOC analyzer (Shimadzu TOC-VCPN).

For reusability
test, the used catalyst powders obtained after
one photocatalytic cycle were collected and washed with distilled
water, dried at 60 °C, and then reused. Due to the unavoidable
loss of catalyst powders during the sampling and recovery processes,
parallel photocatalytic runs were conducted to replenish the spent
catalysts.
