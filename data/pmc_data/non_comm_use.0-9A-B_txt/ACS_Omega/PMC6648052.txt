Vinblastine (VLB) is an antimitotic
drug that binds to the vinca
site of tubulin. The molecule possesses a high molecular weight and
a complex chemical structure with many possibilities of metabolization.
Despite advances in drug discovery research in reducing drug toxicity,
the cause and mechanism of VLB-induced adverse drug reactions (ADRs)
remains poorly understood. VLB is metabolized to at least 35 known
metabolites, which have been identified and collected in this present
work. This study also explores how VLB metabolites affect nausea-associated
receptors such as muscarinic, dopaminergic, and histaminic. The metabolites
have stronger binding interactions than acetylcholine (ACh) for muscarinic
M1, M4, and M5 receptors and demonstrate
similar binding profiles to that of the natural substrate, ACh. The
affinities of VLB metabolites to dopaminergic and histaminic receptors,
their absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, toxicity properties,
and the superiority of VLB to ACh for binding to M5R, indicate
their potential to trigger activation of nausea-associated receptors
during chemotherapy with VLB. It has been shown that metabolite 20-hydroxy-VLB
(metabolite 10) demonstrates a stronger binding affinity to the vinca
site of tubulin than VLB; however, they have similar modes of action.
VLB and metabolite 10 have similar gastric solubility (FaSSGF), intestinal
solubility (FeSSIF), and log P values. Metabolite
10 has a more acceptable pharmacokinetic profile than VLB, a better
gastric and intestinal solubility. Furthermore, metabolite 10 was
found to be less bound to plasma proteins than VLB. These are desired
and essential features for effective drug bioavailability. Metabolite
10 is not a substrate of CYP2D6 and thus is less likely to cause drug–drug
interactions and ADRs compared to its parent drug. The hydroxyl group
added upon metabolism of VLB suggests that it can also be a reasonable
starting compound for designing the next generation of antimitotic
drugs to overcome P-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug resistance, which
is often observed with vinca alkaloids.

1 Introduction
1.1 Vinblastine
Vinblastine (VLB) or
vincaleukoblastine is an anticancer drug that was initially isolated
from the alkaloids of Madagascar periwinkle (Catharanthus roseus) plant in 1960.1 It acts by inhibiting the polymerization of the
microtubules (MTs) because it binds to the tubulin heterodimer, preventing
the formation of the mitotic spindle, and consequently the cell proliferation
process.2 VLB is effective against many
types of cancers such as renal cell carcinoma,3 Hodgkin’s lymphoma,4 and small
cell cancer such as lung, breast, and colon cancers.5

Anticancer drugs are known to cause many adverse
drug reactions (ADRs) during chemotherapy.6 It has been more than 50 years since VLB was approved, but the ADRs
caused by the high drug toxicity remain poorly understood. The most
common ADRs of VLB are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, alopecia, myelosuppression,
and anemia.7

VLB is known to be highly
distributed throughout the body. It reaches
a maximum plasma concentration (Cmax)
and time (Tmax) of 7.95 μg/mL and
0.08 h, respectively.4 The slow excretion
comes from the high percentage of drug bound to plasma proteins, which
is above 90% for VLB.8 Because of the high
metabolism rate by the hepatobiliary system, the concentration of
VLB is found 50–100 times higher in the bile than in blood
samples.9

VLB has a molecular weight
(MW) of ∼813 g/mol and a chemical
formula of C46H60N4O9,
and thus it is considered a large and complex structure. Catharantine
(CT) of VLB (labeled C1′–C26′) has a 9-membered
azacyclononane ring, which contains a protonated and charged nitrogen
atom at position 6′, a hydroxyl and methyl group at C4′,
an ester group at C18′, and an indole ring. Vindoline moiety
(VD) of VLB (labeled N1–C30) is the major alkaloid from the
periwinkle plant.7a It also has an indole
ring that contains an N-methyl at position 1 and
a methoxy moiety at C16. It contains an ester and a hydroxyl group
at C3, as well as an ester and an ethyl group at C4 and C5, respectively.
According to the crystal structure of VLB, the molecule exists in
dicationic form whereas the N6′ of CT and the N9 of VD are
both protonated and positively charged10 (Figure 1A).

1.2 Metabolites of VLB
VLB is likely
to form a variety of metabolites due to its molecular complexity and
hence leads to several ADRs. The majority of the experiments regarding
the identification of metabolites of VLB are performed in vivo, but
they lack the chemical elucidation of the possible compounds formed
during the VLB metabolism. The three recent studies have proposed
a possible fragmentation of VLB. Twenty chemical structures were indicated
as metabolites of VLB and elucidated in vitro utilizing the mass spectrophotometry
technique11 (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Thirty-five identified metabolites of VLB.

Moreover, an in vivo study of
the metabolites of vinorelbine, an
analogue of VLB is also included in this study.12 The chemical structure of vinorelbine only differs from
VLB in the CT moiety, which lacks the hydroxyl group observed in position
C20′ of VLB (Figure 1B).

A metabolite of vinorelbine, which undergoes oxidation
and cyclization
in the VD was also previously elucidated by Elmarakby et al. as a
possible metabolite of VLB.13 This suggested
that vinorelbine and VLB both go through the same metabolic reactions.
There are 35 known metabolites of VLB identified to date. VLB mainly
undergoes hydroxylation, demethylation, and hydrolysis metabolic reactions.
The MW of VLB metabolites varies from 353.44 to 828.99 g/mol; however,
only a minority of them have their MW increased (higher than the MW
of VLB) due to aromatic hydroxylation.11,12 The VD moiety
of VLB is more susceptible to metabolic reactions than its CT due
to a high number of active functional groups prone to metabolism (Figure 2 and Table 1).

1.3 Nausea-Associated Receptors
Chemotherapy-induced
nausea and vomiting (CINV) is the most common and unpleasant ADR during
cancer treatment.14 CINV does not only
impact the quality of life of a cancer patient but it can also lead
to disease complications, such as dehydration and malnutrition.14a There are prophylactic interventions to avoid
or attenuate CINV such as antiemetic drugs (e.g., olanzapine and ondansetron)
or a combination of other nausea-associated receptor antagonists.14a,15 However, CINV still remains a concern for the healthcare system
and cancer patients.

Nausea is stimulated by a variety of mechanisms
in our body.6b The chemoreceptor trigger
zone and the vestibular system are vulnerable areas found outside
the blood brain barrier (BBB) that can trigger nausea.16 Other mechanisms such as those in the gastrointestinal
(GI) tract and the cerebral cortex can also stimulate the vomiting
center and cause emesis.16 We have previously
investigated the main neurotransmitters involved in nausea and identified
some of the main receptors whose activation is associated with nausea.6b

Dopamine, histamine, acetylcholine (ACh),
and serotonin are the
main neurotransmitters known to play important roles in emesis.6b These molecules bind specifically to nausea-associated
receptors, dopaminergic (D1, D2, D3, D4, and D5), histaminic (H1, H2, H3, and H4), muscarinic (M1, M2, M3, M4, and M5),
and serotoninergic receptors, respectively. Moreover, cannabinoid,
corticosteroid, neurokinin-1, gabaminergic, and opioid receptors are
also included in the nausea pathway.6b,16,17 These, along with the serotoninergic receptors, will
be elaborated elsewhere.

1.3.1 Dopaminergic Receptors
Dopaminergic
receptor subtypes, D1, D2, D3, D4, and D5, share a high homology with distinct biological
features. They are composed of seven-transmembrane domains and their
molecular mechanisms involve regulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate,
which triggers a variety of biological signaling. Antagonists of dopaminergic
receptors have been extensively studied for the treatment of nausea
and psychological disorders.18 Osinski
et al. have shown that the activation of D2R and D3R triggers the emesis process in ferrets treated with specific
receptor agonists.19

1.3.2 Histaminic Receptors
The natural
substrate of histaminic receptors subtypes, H1, H2, H3, and H4, is histamine. It plays an important
role in regulating the mucosa immunity, motility, neurotransmission,
and visceral nociception of the GI tract.20

Sullivant et al. have shown that the presence of subtypes
H1, H2, and H3 is more highly expressed
than the H4 subtype throughout the GI tract of dogs with
canine inflammatory bowel disease.20c This
is in agreement with previous research performed in humans that demonstrates
a similar distribution of histaminic receptors in the GI tract.21 In particular, H1R is extensively
distributed in the smooth muscle and gastric mucosa, and H3R is mainly found at the myenteric plexus, a major nerve supply also
involved in motility.20c,21

A case report of 2008 shows
that cyclizine, a second generation
of the H1R antagonists, is effective in managing nausea
induced by chemotherapy.22 Studies of H1R antagonists have also demonstrated that this class of drugs
is effective in postoperative nausea and vomiting as well.23

1.3.3 Muscarinic Receptors
The identified
muscarinic receptor subtypes, M1, M2, M3, M4, and M5, are also expressed in
the parasympathetic system. They regulate function of the GI tract
and endocrine and cardiac systems.24

The endogenous substrate responsible for the activation of the muscarinic
receptors, ACh, exerts physiological effects in hormonal and neuronal
pathways. As ACh is found both in the vestibular and GI systems, antagonists
of the natural ligand are useful drugs to treat nausea induced by
different mechanisms. Anticholinergic agents such as scopolamine,
a nonspecific antagonist of muscarinic receptors, have been extensively
studied for the relief of nausea caused by chemotherapy and/or postoperative
situations.25 More specifically, M1R and M5R antagonists have been reported as effective
drug targets during nausea induced by cancer treatment.26

1.4 Tubulin
MTs are
part of the cytoskeleton
and are structurally formed by 13–16 protofilaments of tubulin,
which are aligned side-by-side with a head-to-tail layout forming
hollow cylindrical MTs. Highly dynamic in nature, MTs denote the mitotic
spindle of eukaryotic cells and are strongly involved in cellular
proliferation.2b

The cellular division
promoted by the MTs has made this structure an attractive target for
anticancer drug design, more specifically by targeting the tubulin
heterodimer. The structure of tubulin is composed of two distinct
subunits of proteins known as α- and β-tubulin that forms
a tubulin heterodimer.27

VLB targets
the MTs by inhibiting the polymerization of the protofilaments
impairing the mitotic spindle of cells.28 We have previously studied the binding interactions of VLB with
the αβ-tubulin heterodimer by means of molecular dynamics
simulation.2b In addition, we investigated
how carbon nanotubes function as a drug delivery option for VLB in
order to enhance target specificity and decrease ADRs.29

The presented work aims to identify the
mode of action of VLB metabolites
against MT and looks into their role as nausea-triggering elements.

2 Results and Discussion
VLB and its metabolites
were docked into the nausea-associated
receptors D2, H1, H3, M1, M4, M5, and tubulin using the molecular docking
method. The binding energy values and main binding interactions of
VLB and its metabolites with the target sites were compared to the
known binding interactions of the endogenous substrates for each receptor
(dopamine, histamine, and ACh), in order to evaluate their likelihood
of inducing nausea during chemotherapy. Moreover, the pharmacokinetics
(PK) properties of VLB and its metabolites were also calculated.

2.1 Dopaminergic D2R
The natural
substrate of D2R, dopamine, interacts with residues Phe361
and Val115 through hydrophobic contacts. Additionally, the hydroxyl
group of dopamine makes H-bonds with residue Ser193 (1.9 and 1.8 Å),
and the amine group makes an H-bond and ionic interactions with residue
Asp114 (1.8 Å). Dopamine has a binding energy of −12.89
kJ/mol when it interacts with D2R (Figure 3B and Table S1).

Figure 3 Main binding interactions at the dopaminergic receptor D2. (A) Pose views of overlaid dopamine (spheres), VLB, and metabolite
34 docked into D2R (sticks). Binding interactions of (B)
dopamine; (C) VLB; and (D) metabolite 34. Hydrogen bonds are shown
in dashed lines.

The binding energy of
VLB when docked into D2R is higher
than that of dopamine (−2.37 kJ/mol vs −12.89 kJ/mol).
VLB makes H-bonds with residues Glu181, Gln179, Glu95, and with the
main chain of Leu94. Because of the binding affinity of VLB (−2.37
kJ/mol) for D2R and lack of involvement with residues that
interact with the natural substrate, it is suggested that the anticancer
drug would not compete with dopamine for D2R active site
(Figure 3C and Table S1).

The majority of metabolites
of VLB would not play a role in the
binding site of D2R due to their binding energies being
weaker than that of dopamine. However, metabolite 34 interacts more
strongly than dopamine in the D2R binding site (−17.58
kJ/mol vs −12.89 kJ/mol). The protonated nitrogen atom of the
azacyclononane ring as well as the hydroxyl group establishes H-bonds
with the binding site of D2R through residues Glu95 and
Leu94. Metabolite 34 makes hydrophobic interactions with residues
Asn367, Ile183, Phe110, and Tyr379. Despite the lack of biological
studies on the VLB metabolites and the urge for both in vitro and
in vivo experiments, the present in silico results suggest that metabolite
34 could compete with dopamine for binding to D2R (Figure 3D and Table S1).

2.2 Histaminic
H1R
VLB, its
metabolites, and histamine were docked into the known histamine binding
site in H1R. The docking results of histamine, VLB, and
its metabolites demonstrate that only three metabolites (metabolites
22, 23, and 35) have stronger binding energy than the natural substrate,
among which metabolite 22 has the lowest binding energy, −18.10
kJ/mol (Table S2).

The imidazole
ring of histamine makes H-bonds with residues Asp178 (2.2 Å)
and the protonated amine makes ionic interactions and H-bonds with
Asp107 (1.9 and 2.3 Å) within the binding site of H1R. Moreover, histamine also interacts with residues Ile454 and Tyr431
through hydrophobic contacts with a binding energy of −14.40
kJ/mol for H1R (Figure 4B and Table S2).

Figure 4 Main binding
interactions at the histaminic receptor H1. (A) Pose view
of histamine (spheres), VLB, and metabolite 22 (sticks)
docked into H1R. Binding interactions of (B) histamine;
(C) VLB; and (D) metabolite 22. Hydrogen bonds are shown in dashed
lines.

The binding energy of VLB in the
substrate binding site of H1R is −0.17 kJ/mol. VLB
makes H-bonds with residues
Arg175, Arg97, and Trp93, in which both methyl groups of the ester
groups and the hydroxyl group are involved. Although VLB is able to
interact with H1R residues, it is less likely to play any
effect on the receptor’s function. This is because VLB does
not interact with the same residues involved in the binding of the
natural substrate (histamine) and possesses a binding energy of only
−0.17 kJ/mol (Figure 4C and Table S2).

The metabolites
of VLB that are most likely to display a significant
role in the functionality of H1R are metabolite 22, metabolite
23, and metabolite 35 due to their binding energies (Table S2).

Metabolite 22 (binding energy of −18.10
kJ/mol) interacts
with residues from helices α5 and α6 of H1R,
such as Asp183. Hydrogen bonds are observed between the metabolite
and Asp183 (2.0 and 1.9 Å), Arg175 (1.7 Å), and hydrophobic
interactions with Phe184, Tyr185, and Arg97. Therefore, metabolite
22 competes with histamine for the binding site of H1R
due to its binding energy (−18.10 kJ/mol vs −14.40 kJ/mol).
Thus, it is suggested that metabolite 22 may account for nausea during
chemotherapy with VLB through interaction with H1R (Figure 4D and Table S2).

2.3 Histaminic
H3R
Docking
of histamine into its binding site in the H3 receptor has
a calculated binding energy of −13.42 kJ/mol, and its imidazole
ring makes an H-bond with residue Asp114 (2.1 Å) and the charged
amine with Ser121 and Asp80 at a distance of 2.1 and 1.8 Å, respectively.
Moreover, hydrophobic interactions are seen among the aliphatic chain
of histamine and residue Trp371 (Figure 5B and Table S3).

Figure 5 Main binding interactions at the histaminic receptor H3. (A) Pose view of histamine (spheres), VLB, and metabolite 18 (sticks)
docked into H3R. Binding interactions of (B) histamine;
(C) VLB; and (D) metabolite 18. Hydrogen bonds are shown in dashed
lines.

In the same binding site, VLB
binds with an energy of −13.78
kJ/mol, with its azacyclononane ring having an H-bond with Cys188
(1.8 Å). Residues Tyr194 (through an H-bond), Phe193, Tyr115,
Arg381, and Tyr94 (via vdW forces) participate in the interactions
with VLB. VLB and histamine have very close binding energies (−13.78
kJ/mol vs −13.42 kJ/mol), and thus the anticancer drug could
compete with the natural substrate for the binding site of H1R (Figure 5C and Table S3).

Metabolite 18 has the lowest
binding energy among the metabolites
of VLB (−19.67 kJ/mol vs −13.42 kJ/mol of VLB). Similar
to VLB, metabolite 18 is located at the entrance of the binding pocket
(Figure 5A and Table S3).

Metabolite 18 makes H-bonds
with Tyr115, Cys188, and Arg381, whereas
residue Tyr115 binds to the carbonyl group of ester, and the main
chain of Cys188 interacts with the hydroxyl group of VD and with Tyr94
and Tyr194 by vdW forces. Therefore, because of the binding energy
of metabolite 18 (−19.67 kJ/mol) and its occupation in the
same site as the substrate, this metabolite would compete with histamine
for the binding pocket of H3R regardless of its interactions
with the residues in proximity to the residues in the histamine network
(Figure 5D and Table S3).

2.4 Muscarinic
M1R
ACh binds
to M1R with a total energy of −4.79 kJ/mol resulting
from H-bonds with Tyr404 and Tyr106, within distances of 2.2 and 2.4
Å, respectively. Hydrophobic interactions are seen among the N-trimethyl group of ACh and residues Asp105 and Tyr381
(Figure 6B and Table S4).

Figure 6 Main binding interactions at the muscarinic
receptor M1. (A) Pose view of ACh (spheres), VLB, and metabolite
22 (sticks)
docked into M1R. Binding interactions of (B) ACh; (C) VLB;
and (D) metabolite 22. Hydrogen bonds are shown in dashed lines.

VLB, which has a lower binding
affinity for M1R than
ACh (−3.77 kJ/mol vs −4.79 kJ/mol, respectively), possesses
H-bonds to Leu183 and Ser388 through its CT moiety. Gln177 interacts
with the ester group at C4 of VLB’s VD moiety and with Trp400,
Tyr404, and Tyr179 via hydrophobic interactions. VLB shares Tyr404
with ACh interaction subsite that is reinforced by the vdW force (Figure 6C and Table S4).

The metabolites of VLB that
would play a major role in the activation
of M1R are metabolites 22 and 23 due to their binding energies
(−18.10 and −16.86 kJ/mol, respectively) and their similar
interaction profiles to the ACh.

Metabolite 22 has the lowest
binding energy in the ACh binding
site of M1R with the estimated magnitude of −18.24
kJ/mol. The binding energy of metabolite 22 is more than 3 times stronger
than the binding energy of ACh (−4.79 kJ/mol) (Table S4).

The binding energy of metabolite
22 results from the H-bond with
Asn382 within 1.6 Å distance and hydrophobic interactions with
Ala193, Tyr381, Tyr106, and Phe197. Similar to ACh, metabolite 22
interacts with residues Tyr106 and Tyr381. Metabolite 22 has shown
to be potentially a better agonist of M1R than ACh due
to its stronger binding (−18.24 kJ/mol vs −4.79 kJ/mol).
It shows as well a binding profile similar to that of ACh (i.e., interacts
with Tyr106 and Tyr381). Thus, it could account for nausea during
chemotherapy with VLB through muscarinic receptor activation. This
suggests that further biological studies are required for supplementing
these findings (Figure 6D and Table S4).

Tyr106 and Tyr404
are involved in the binding of ACh and metabolite
23. An H-bond is observed among residue Tyr106 and the ester group
of metabolite 23, within a distance of 1.7 Å. This interaction
is 0.7 Å shorter than that of ACh with Tyr106 (2.4 Å). Moreover,
Tyr404 interacts with the protonated nitrogen of indole ring within
a distance of 1.6, 0.6 Å shorter than that with ACh (2.2 Å).
Metabolite 23 also makes H-bonds with Leu183 and Ile180, thus metabolite
23 with a interaction profile similar to the ACh, and a higher binding
affinity could contribute in triggering nausea through activation
of M1R (Figure S1).

The
metabolites other than 22 and 23 also bind to the binding site
of M1R; however, they do not demonstrate any significant
difference with ACh in terms of their binding energy nor do they share
the same residues with the ACh interaction network. This implies that
they are less likely to compete with ACh or interfere largely with
the ACh-M1R natural function. Nevertheless, metabolites
22 and 23 have significant binding affinities for M1R and
share similar binding interactions to those of ACh (Tyr106, Tyr404
and Tyr381) and hence could induce nausea during treatment with VLB.

2.5 Muscarinic M4R
ACh binds
to M4R with −7.65 kJ/mol of binding energy through
hydrophobic contacts and H-bonds with Tyr439, Tyr113, and Asp112.
The carbonyl of the ester group of ACh makes an H-bond with Tyr439
(3.0 Å) and Tyr113 (2.2 Å) (Figure 7B and Table S5).

Figure 7 Main binding interactions at the muscarinic receptor M4. (A) Pose view of ACh (spheres), VLB, and metabolite 13 (sticks)
docked into M4R. Binding interactions of (B) ACh; (C) VLB;
and (D) Metabolite 13. Hydrogen bonds are shown in dashed lines.

VLB has a binding energy of −3.90
kJ/mol when it interacts
with Tyr92 through an H-bond and with Ile93 and Gln184 by vdW forces.
However, it has less affinity for the receptor compared with ACh (−3.77
kJ/mol vs −7.65 kJ/mol). This could prevent VLB from playing
any major role in ACh’s natural effect by binding to the M4R. However, some of its metabolites have significant binding
affinities for M4R (Figure 7C and Table S5).

Metabolite
13 has the lowest binding energy among the metabolites,
which is nearly more than twice than that of ACh (−20.65 kJ/mol
vs −7.65 kJ/mol). The affinity of metabolite 13 results from
its H-bonds with Ile187, Gln427, and Asn423, and the hydrophobic interactions
of its ethyl group with Tyr439, an amino acid shared with ACh binding
network, as well as vdW interactions with Phe186, Leu190, and Cys185.
Thus, it could potentially contribute to the onset of nausea (Figure 7D and Table S5).

Other metabolites with better
binding affinity than ACh that display
interactions similar to that of ACh are metabolite 19, metabolite
18, metabolite 34, metabolite 22, metabolite 23, and metabolite 10,
and thus they could trigger the onset of nausea during chemotherapy
with VLB (Table S5).

Many of the
VLB metabolites have better binding affinity for M4R than
ACh; however, their interaction profiles are different
from that of ACh. This may result in a different induced effect during
the signaling process. Metabolite 19 binds to M4R with
a binding strength of −18.63 kJ/mol. This is mainly due to
hydrophobic interactions and an H-bond with Tyr439, which is also
involved with ACh binding. Tyr439 interacts with metabolite 19 within
a distance of 2.2, 0.8 Å shorter than ACh (3.0 Å). In addition,
hydrophobic contacts are seen with Trp435 and Cys185. Hence, metabolite
19 could also contribute to triggering nausea, similar to metabolite
18 (−17.19 kJ/mol), metabolite 23 (−16.63 kJ/mol), metabolite
34 (−17.10 kJ/mol), metabolite 22 (−16.71 kJ/mol), or
even metabolite 10, 20-hydroxy-VLB (−10.16 kJ/mol) (Figure 8 and Table S5).

sticks and hydrogen bonds in dashed lines.

2.6 Muscarinic M5R
ACh binds
to M5R via Tyr480, Tyr110, and Tyr457, while its carbonyl
group makes H-bonds to Tyr480 and Tyr110 within respective distances
of 2.6 and 2.2 Å. It has hydrophobic interactions with Tyr457
as well as Asp109 (Figure 9B and Table S6).

VLB, and metabolite 18 (sticks)
docked into M5R. Binding interactions of (B) ACh; (C) VLB;
and (D) metabolite 18. Hydrogen bonds are shown in dashed lines.

VLB with a binding energy of −9.28
kJ/mol for M5R has ∼4 kJ/mol lower than that of
ACh (−4.51 kJ/mol),
which stems from VLB’s H-bonds with Asp468 and Gln183. The
VLB hydroxyl group at C4′ and the protonated nitrogen at N9
both make H-bonds with Asp468, within respective 1.6 and 1.9 Å
distances. The positively charged protonated nitrogen in the azacyclononane
ring of VLB (N6′) electrostatically interacts with the negative
charge of Asp468, while Gln183 interacts with the carbonyl ester group
through an H-bond (2.2 Å). Hydrophobic interactions of Asp468,
Gln183, Trp476, and Val473 with the azacyclononane ring and ester
methyl groups of CT moiety of VLB also contribute to the total binding
strength of the ligand. Although VLB does not bind to the same residues
involved with ACh in M5R, it occupies the same binding
site with nearly twice the strength of ACh (−9.28 kJ/mol vs
−4.51 kJ/mol) (Figure 9C and Table S6).

Similar
to muscarinic M1 and M4 receptors,
many of VLB metabolites, such as metabolite 18 and metabolite 23,
bind to M5R more strongly than ACh and often interact with
the same residues binding to those involved with ACh (e.g., Tyr480
and Tyr110) (Tables S4–S6).

The calculated binding energy of metabolite 18 is −18.68
kJ/mol when docked into the binding site of M5R. It interacts
with residues Asp468, Lys469, and Gln183 through H-bonds. The amide
group of Gln183 interacts with the carbonyl ester (2.0 Å) and
with the indole ring (1.7 Å) of metabolite 18. It has hydrophobic
interactions with Val473 and Trp476, as well. Thus, metabolite 18
could trigger the onset of nausea during chemotherapy with VLB (Figure 9D and Table S6).

The interactions of metabolite
23 to the binding site of M5R are over 3 times stronger
than that of ACh (−14.11
and −4.51 kJ/mol). The hydroxyl group makes H-bonds within
2.5 Å radiuses of Tyr110, which is 0.3 Å farther than the
ACh (2.5 Å vs 2.2 Å). However, it has an extra H-bond with
residue Thr193 (2.2 Å), implying that metabolite 23 is capable
of inducing nausea through activation of M5R (Figure 10A and Table S6).

Figure 10 Binding interactions of (A) metabolite
23 and (B) metabolite 23
docked into M5R. ACh is shown in white sticks and hydrogen
bonds in dashed lines.

Tyr480, which makes an H-bond with the endogenous substrate
ACh
(2.6 Å), makes H-bond with the hydroxyl group of metabolite 22
within a distance of 1.9 Å, which is 0.7 Å shorter than
the one seen with the substrate (1.9 Å vs 2.6 Å). Metabolite
22 binds over 3 times more strongly than ACh (−18.41 kJ/mol)
to M5R. Metabolite 22 binds to the same residues involved
with ACh in the binding pocket of M5R and similar to metabolite
23 could trigger the onset of nausea (Figure 10B).

2.7 Binding
to Tubulin
The virtual screening
of the ligand library against tubulin vinca site resulted in a binding
solution with an energy of −11.23 kJ/mol for VLB. Its conformation
adaption shows the major role of CT moiety in VLB binding and agrees
with the previously published data in this regard.2b,30 VLB makes H-bonds with Asn329 and Lys336 of α-tubulin along
with Lys176 and Val177 of β-tubulin (Tables 2, S7 and Figure S2).

More specifically, the protonated N16′ interacts with the
carbonyl group of the main chain of Lys176 within a distance of 2.3
Å; the hydroxyl group at C4′ interacts with the main chain
of Val177 within a distance of 1.9 Å; the carbonyl of ester at
C18′ interacts with the amide group of Asn329 (2.1 Å);
and the carbonyl group at C3 interacts with Lys336 within a distance
of 2.3 Å (Figure 11B and Table 3).

Most of the VLB metabolites bind to the heterodimer
of tubulin
with the binding strength ranging from −21.90 kJ/mol of metabolite
19 to −0.45 kJ/mol of metabolite 4 (Table S7).

That could be due to the fact that the three rings
of VD which
are opened after metabolism provides metabolite 19 more conformational
flexibility to fit into the deep tubulin binding site. Although the
metabolite does not bind to all of the exact residues interacting
with VLB, it makes a shorter H-bond with Asn329 (α-tubulin)
than VLB2b (1.6 Å vs 2.1 Å).
Furthermore, it binds more strongly than the parent compound, VLB
(−21.90 kJ/mol vs −11.23 kJ/mol). Metabolite 19 makes
H-bonds with β-tubulin amino acids, including Asp179 and Pro222,
which are also involved in VLB binding. Moreover, hydrophobic interactions
with Ser178, Val177, Tyr210 (β-tubulin), and Leu248 (α-tubulin),
also observed with VLB, contribute to the metabolite binding (Figure 11D).

Metabolites
that have adapted conformation similar to that of VLB
in the vinca site of tubulin are metabolite 8, metabolite 10, and
metabolite 11. These compounds have additional moieties in their structure
that enhance their binding affinity for tubulin. Metabolite 11 has
undergone an N-oxidation reaction at N6′ during VLB metabolism.
Metabolite 10 is hydroxylated at position C20 of VD and metabolite
8 has undergone aromatic hydroxylation at C13′ of CT. Besides
adapting conformation similar to that of VLB at the tubulin heterodimer
binding site, metabolite 8, metabolite 10, and metabolite 11 have
stronger binding energy (−12.18, −13.39, and −14.24
kJ/mol, respectively) than VLB (−11.23 kJ/mol). As expected,
these metabolites bind to the same residues that interact with the
parent drug through H-bonds (Lys176, Val177, Asn329, and Lys336).
The strength of these interactions and high binding energy are due
to the close proximity of atoms involved in H-bonds (Figure 2, Tables 3 and S7).

Studies have investigated possible analogues of VLB that display
stronger target selectivity and hence higher cytotoxicity. Chemical
modifications on the CT of VLB (CT) at the C20′ ethyl substituent,
such as the addition of hydrophobic groups, have shown significant
increased potency toward destabilization of tubulin.30c In a lesser extent, the C5 ethyl substituent at the VD
of VLB, an important chemical group for biological activity of VLB,
has also been chemically modified.31 Va
et al. have analyzed different compounds and their cytotoxic potency
against cancer cell lines (i.e., colon cancer HCT116) mainly by modifying
the C5 ethyl moiety. However, the chemical bond among C6 and C7 of
VD was also modified to either a double or single bond. In a C6–C7
single bond version, the addition of CH2OH group at C5
position (referring C19 of VD) has reduced the biological activity
by 10-fold (compound 56)31 (Figure 1).

As compared to VLB,
metabolite 10 has one extra H-bond with Asp179.
The hydroxyl group added at C5 of VD (attached to C20) shares its
electron deficiency with the side chain of Asp179 of β-tubulin
within a distance of 2.2 Å. The corresponding heteroatoms of
Lys336, Asn329, Val177, and Lys176 are farther from metabolite 10
than they are from VLB. However, an extra H-bond between the hydroxyl
group at C5 of metabolite 10 and Asp179 strengthens the interaction
of the metabolite with tubulin. Thus, metabolite 10 is a stronger
binder than VLB (−13.39 kJ/mol vs −11.23 kJ/mol) while
it displays the same binding profile (Figure 11C and Table S7).

(FaSSGF) of VLB is higher than the intestinal solubility in the fasted

The calculated amount for human jejunal effective
permeability
(Peff) of VLB is 0.58 cm/s × 104. In vivo studies by Ogihara et al.32 have demonstrated that VLB has an intestinal permeability of less
than 1.0 × 10–6 cm/s. Compounds with a Peff lower than 0.5 cm/s × 104 have low permeability.33 VLB has a Peff of slightly higher than 0.5 cm/s ×
104 (∼0.58 cm/s × 104), and thus
it is considered to be poorly absorbed by the intestines as it is
administered by IV route (Table 4).

The predicted absorption, distribution, metabolism,
excretion,
toxicity (ADMET) properties of VLB compares to two of the Lipinski’s
rule of five (RO5) criteria, as it has a log P 3.95
and three HBD groups within the criteria suggested by Lipinski (log P and number of HBD groups both <5).6a,34 Despite log P value of VLB indicating its suitable
drug likeness (log P < 5.0) according to the RO5,
it is poorly absorbed via the oral route as mentioned before. This
is due to its extensive binding to plasma proteins and to P-glycoprotein
(P-gp) transporter, which are contributing factors to poor oral bioavailability.
In this case, a drug requires to first unbind from any plasma proteins
prior to reaching its target. Once it binds to the cell target, it
effluxes the cell by P-gp.35 Therefore,
the poor oral bioavailability of VLB may be due to its gastric and
intestinal solubility, Peff and affinity
for both P-gp and plasma proteins. Moreover, VLB has an MW of ∼813
g/mol, which ∼300 g/mol exceeds the acceptable magnitude according
to the RO5, and thus influences the low likelihood of oral drug bioavailability6a,34 (Table 4).

Metabolite 23 has 3.70 mg/mL intestinal solubility in the fasted
state (FaSSIF). Having the highest intestinal solubility among the
metabolites (3.70 mg/mL vs 0.01 mg/mL), it is likely to be reabsorbed
into the blood circulation system. However, considering its log P value of 0.22 and Peff through
the small intestine (0.36 cm/s × 104), metabolite
23 is probably not reabsorbed into the portal circulation in the liver.
This is because compounds with a Peff less
than 0.5 cm/s × 104 and a low log P (<1) have low permeability and are too hydrophilic to cross the
cellular membrane33 (Table 4).

Very hydrophilic compounds with
poor membrane permeability (less
than 0.5 cm/s × 10–4) are more likely to be
excreted through the kidneys or remain in the intestines rather than
to be reabsorbed in the blood system.35 Thus, it is expected that metabolite 23 remains in the intestines
or is excreted through the renal route. If the former is the case,
metabolite 23 could interact with H1R, M1R,
M4R, and M5R as these receptors are found throughout
the body.36 In addition, metabolite 23
binds to these receptors with stronger affinities, with respective
values of −15.13, −16.86, −16.63, and −14.11
kJ/mol, than the corresponding natural substrates histamine and ACh
(−14.40, −4.79, −7.65, and −4.51 kJ/mol,
respectively). Thus, according to the predicted ADME properties for
metabolite 23 and its likelihood of interaction with nausea-associated
receptors, the metabolite could cause nausea symptoms during chemotherapy
with VLB (Tables 4, S2, S4–S6).

Moreover, metabolite
26, metabolite 29, metabolite 31, metabolite
34, and metabolite 35 all have poor intestinal solubility (values
close to 0 mg/mL) in the fed or fasted states (gastric and intestinal).
They have high log P (>5.0) and high Peff (>0.5 cm/s × 104) ranging from
4.93
to 7.04 and 1.08 to 4.73 cm/s × 104 (Table 4).

The three parameters,
solubility, log P, and Peff, could be used for assessing whether a drug
could reach to the blood circulation. For instance, there is a higher
possibility for metabolites 26, 29, 31, 34, and 35 than metabolite
23 to cross the intestinal membranes and to be reabsorbed into the
blood system according to their Peff and
log P values. If these metabolites are reabsorbed
into the blood system, they could account for further off-target interactions
with proteins or receptors and cause ADRs. In addition, metabolite
22 and metabolite 34 have a high Peff,
1.99 and 2.22 cm/s × 104, compared to the Peff calculated for the other metabolites, and
a high likelihood to cross the BBB for their ability to cross the
membrane. These physicochemical properties facilitate their promiscuous
off-target binding. In addition, metabolite 22 and metabolite 34 display
affinities for all nausea-associated receptors studied in this work
(H1R, H3R, D2R, M1R, M4R, and M5R) and thus have increased potential of
causing ADRs (Table 4).

2.8.2 Volume of Distribution, Plasma Proteins,
log D, and BBB
The first possible interaction
of VLB and the blood protein human serum albumin (HSA) was demonstrated
in vitro in 1973,37 showing that VLB is
75% bound to the plasma proteins. Despite affinity for blood proteins,
the biological effects of VLB are increased compared to other anticancer
agents with biological effects diminished in the presence of albumin.37 Pandya et al. demonstrated that VLB binds more
weakly to HSA than to its target tubulin (−7.6 kJ/mol vs −10.0
kJ/mol).38 These are in agreement with
the in silico results that shows VLB is 89.22% bound to plasma proteins
due to its hydrophilic character and affinity for these proteins,
meaning that only ∼10.78% of the drug is in the free form and
available to interact with its target tubulin. Therefore, the in vitro
data support the in silico results demonstrating that although VLB
is highly bound to plasma proteins, it still displays desired biological
effects (Table 5).

The calculated Vd value of VLB is 13.41
L/kg, indicating its high potential of distribution throughout the
body. This is in agreement with previous research stating that vinca
alkaloids have significant Vd.8a,39 It could explain the long half-life of 35 h of VLB compared to other
anticancer drugs4 as it is dispersed throughout
the body and thus takes a long time to be excreted (Table 5).

Metabolite 11 and metabolite
20 are found in high amounts in the
body according to their predicted Vd values
of 0.46 and 0.72 L/kg, respectively. However, neither of these metabolites
displays a significant interaction with any of the nausea-associated
receptors in this study. Therefore, more research needs to be done
to evaluate other possible interactions during their clearance to
identify other off-targets receptors (Table 5).

Metabolite 17, metabolite 26, metabolite
29, metabolite 31, metabolite
34, and metabolite 35 have high affinities for the plasma proteins
(<3% unbound). Even though metabolite 17 does not have an affinity
for M5R (−4.34 kJ/mol vs −4.51 kJ/mol for
ACh), all of the aforementioned metabolites have stronger binding
energies than ACh for M5R (−11.07, −12.40,
−12.08, −17.93, and −16.06 kJ/mol vs −4.51
kJ/mol). It is useful to compare the binding affinity of these metabolites
against the muscarinic receptors and plasma proteins as the former
receptors are also present in the blood circulation. Therefore, more
research is required to investigate the binding profile of them in
respect to the plasma proteins (Table S6).

Drugs capable of crossing the BBB must be lipophilic enough
to
be absorbed by the cell membranes and enter into the brain.35 The low likelihood of VLB to cross the BBB is
calculated to be log −0.95. VLB has a partial hydrophilic character
with charged atoms such as the protonated nitrogen atoms at N6′
and N9 that make its entrance through the endothelial cells of the
central nervous system difficult.40 Studies
have shown that the likelihood of drugs crossing the BBB is also related
to their affinity for P-gp, either as substrates or inhibitors of
the efflux transporter.41 P-gp removes
drugs out of the endothelial cells into the blood vessels, thus hindering
them to cross the BBB. As will be discussed next, the in silico results
show that VLB is both a substrate and inhibitor of P-gp. An in vivo
study suggests that the poor permeability of VLB into the BBB is linked
to the P-gp-mediated efflux in the brain, which limits the capacity
of VLB to enter the brain.41a Therefore,
previous research supports the in silico data found for VLB that it
is not likely to cross the BBB (Table 5).

2.8.3 P-gp and Human Ether-à-go-go-Related
Gene
VLB and its metabolites are all transported by P-gp,
whereas a majority of them can also inhibit this protein according
to the in silico results. The metabolites transported out of the cell
by P-gp are metabolite 11, metabolite 20, metabolite 22, metabolite
23, metabolite 27, metabolite 28, and metabolite 32. Horio et al.
have explained that VLB is actively transported by P-gp in Hodgkin’s
disease cells (KB cells) with a transport affinity of 2 μM for
P-gp.42 Posterior studies have shown that
VLB is also an inhibitor and inducer of P-gp.3,39,43 Thus, VLB is transported out of the cell
by P-gp and inhibit the functionality of this protein and/or induce
its activity to transport other xenobiotics. According to the in silico
results, not only VLB but also its metabolites are transported by
P-gp and can inhibit the P-gp protein.

Metabolite 22 and metabolite
23 have a high probability to cross the BBB (−0.25 and −0.79)
and are transported by P-gp. If drugs capable of crossing the BBB
are taken in concomitance with VLB, metabolites 22 and 23 could potentially
compete with them for interaction with P-gp in the brain. If metabolite
22 and metabolite 23 are better binders to P-gp than the concomitant
drugs, an increase of blood concentration of either metabolite or
of the concomitant drugs in the brain would be expected. Therefore,
as these metabolites are transported out of the cell membrane due
to their P-gp affinity, the chances of off-target events and thus
drug–drug interactions (DDI) induced by these compounds are
increased within the brain environment (Table 5).

The human ether-à-go-go-related
gene (hERG) receptor, a
potassium channel receptor responsible for the action potential of
myocardiocytes, is also an important enzyme in PK studies due to its
cardiotoxicity induced by a drug inhibitory effect.44 Compounds with an inhibitory concentration (IC50) less than or equal to 10 μM have an affinity for the hERG
potassium channel and thus block the receptor.33 In agreement with previous research,45 the in silico predicted ADMET data show that VLB does not
interact with hERG receptor, but some of its metabolites such as metabolite
19, metabolite 21, metabolite 27, metabolite 30, metabolite 31, metabolite
32, metabolite 34, and metabolite 35 have an affinity for the receptor.
Their predicted inhibitory concentrations (pIC50) for hERG
inhibition are 6.25, 6.07, 6.09, 6.03, 6.18, 6.02, 6.88, and 6.71
mol/L, respectively. Therefore, the metabolites blocking hERG channel
could cause postchemotherapy cardiovascular complications. Previous
research has shown that tubulin-binding drugs have a probability of
inducing cardiotoxicity during cancer treatment through damage of
the endothelial cells of the myocardium; however, this mechanism is
not yet fully known.46 Thus, further research
is required to evaluate detailed mechanism of triggering cardiotoxic
events during the clearance of VLB.

2.8.4 Cytochrome
P450 Complex
Similar
to ondansetron, metabolite 22, metabolite 23, metabolite 34, and metabolite
35 are all metabolized by CYP1A2. Thus, it is expected that the binding
competition among the antiemetic drug and VLB or its metabolites for
CYP1A2 could determine their differences in plasma concentrations
as these drugs are usually used in concomitance during chemotherapy.47

The predicted ADMET properties show that
metabolite 2, metabolite 3, metabolite 15, metabolite 16, metabolite
17, and metabolite 34 are treated by CYP2C8 enzyme. In addition, metabolite
2, metabolite 15, metabolite 17, metabolite 20, metabolite 24, metabolite
25, metabolite 26, and metabolite 27 are able to inhibit CYP2C9, whereas
only metabolite 35 is metabolized by CYP2C9.

The in silico results
have shown that VLB and almost all of its
metabolites can inhibit CYP2D6, but not all of them are metabolized
by this enzyme (NB). VLB and its metabolites which are treated by
CYP2D6 might have DDI with inhibitors of this enzyme, such as quinidine,
cimetidine, and ritonavir.48 The concomitant
intake of compounds that are metabolized by or inhibit CYP2D6 can
potentially lead to an increase on the plasma concentration level
of VLB. This is due to the lower metabolism rate of VLB triggered
by enzymatic competition of CYP2D6. For instance, if VLB is taken
along with the antiarrhythmic agent quinidine, an inhibitor of CYP2D6,
the plasma concentrations of VLB are increased because CYP2D6 is inhibited
by quinidine and thus can cause drug toxicity49 (Table S8).

Moreover, VLB can also
cause DDI with drugs that are metabolized
by CYP2D6.50 Ondansetron is an antiemetic
agent often administered during cancer treatment.51 Because it is metabolized by CYPD2652 similarly to VLB, ondansetron would compete with VLB for
metabolism with CYP2D6 and would therefore be likely to cause DDI
because one of the two compounds would have its plasma concentrations
increased.

CYP3A4 plays the major role in the metabolism of
VLB and its metabolites.53 Some VLB metabolites
are metabolized by both
CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, such as metabolite 1, metabolite 2, metabolite
5, metabolite 7, metabolite 13, and metabolite 14. As these metabolites
could potentially bind to CYP3A4 similar to VLB, they could interfere
with the metabolism of the drugs binding to CYP3A4 when another drug
is taken in concomitance (Table 6 and S8).

According to the in silico
predictions, the metabolism of VLB and
all of its metabolites can be treated by CYP3A4 as well; however,
they also inhibit CYP3A4. This is in agreement with the in vitro PK
study of VLB, which has shown that VLB is both a substrate39,54 and an inhibitor of CYP3A4,55 as it is
observed for its metabolites. Levêque and Jehl have revised
the PK of the main vinca alkaloids used to treat cancer and shown
that VLB is highly metabolized by CYP3A4 in human liver microsomes.39 In addition, Zhou-Pan et al. have demonstrated
that the Km and Vmax constants of VLB for CYP4A4 are 6.82 ± 0.27 μM
and 0.64 ± 0.06 nmol/min/mg P450, respectively.54 The inhibitory effect of CYP3A4 caused by VLB was investigated
by Baumhäkel et al., who have shown that the IC50 of VLB was 20 and 44 μmol/L in two human liver microsome samples,
respectively, compared with the plasma concentrations of antineoplastic
drugs taken during chemotherapy.55 Both
inhibition of, or metabolism by CYP3A4 are important factors to explain
treatment failures commonly seen with VLB as well as ADRs caused by
DDI when co-administered with other drugs (Table 6).

VLB has a Michaelis–Menten
constant (Km) of 19.9 μM and a maximum
metabolic rate (Vmax) of 25.2 nmol/min–1/nmol–1 P450 for CYP3A4. VLB has
a much higher Km for CYP2D6 (1443.0 μM)
than for CYP3A4 (19.9 μM), which
indicates a significant affinity for the latter enzyme (Table 6 and S8).

2.8.5 Phase II Metabolism–Glucuronidation
Reactions
VLB and its metabolites were screened against uridine
5′-diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT), an enzyme responsible
for catalyzing glucuronidation reaction during phase II drug metabolism.56 In particular, the UGT isoforms UGT1A1, UGT1A3,
UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A8, UGT1A9, UGT1A10, UGT2B7, and UGT2B15 were
experimentally tested for VLB and its metabolites in this work. The
in silico data show that VLB is not catalyzed by any of the UGT enzymes.
This indicates that VLB is not conjugated through glucuronidation
metabolism. This correlates with Owellen et al. that demonstrated
that VLB undergoes neither glucuronide nor sulfate formation.57 However, some of the metabolites undergo glucuronidation
reactions with enzymes UGT1A3 (metabolite 9, metabolite 26, metabolite
27 and metabolite 32), UGT1A8 (metabolite 19), and UGT2B7 (metabolite
22 and metabolite 23) while the remaining metabolites do not undergo
glucuronidation (Table 7).

3 Conclusions
VLB and its metabolites were docked into
nausea-associated receptors
D2, H1, H3, M1, M4, and M5 by means of molecular docking and their
binding interactions were compared to those of dopamine, histamine,
and ACh. Furthermore, the ADMET properties of VLB and its metabolites
were predicted through in silico experiments. The results have shown
that VLB plays a role in the M5R, and it might compete
with histamine for the binding site of H3R. VLB and histamine
share most of the residues in their nearest interaction subsites,
which include Tyr194, Cys188, Tyr115, Tyr194, and Arg381. Thus, it
is probable that VLB competes closely with histamine for occupying
the binding site of H3R. The metabolites of VLB bind to
all of the nausea-associated receptors used in this study and thus
are able to trigger emesis during chemotherapy with VLB. The molecular
docking has shown that the metabolites of VLB have binding affinities
mainly for the muscarinic receptors, with binding interactions similar
to that of ACh.

Because metabolite 22 and metabolite 23 have
both binding affinities
stronger than that of ACh and share the same binding profile as that
of ACh in the binding pocket of M1R, they could potentially
involve the onset of nausea through M1R activation (Table S4).

The metabolites of VLB also
display binding affinities for M4R and thus are involved
with nausea during chemotherapy with
VLB through this additional receptor. Metabolite 13 has a binding
energy of −20.65 kJ/mol, which is more than twice that of ACh
(−7.65 kJ/mol). Although it does not interact with any of the
residues directly interacting with ACh, it can compete with the natural
substrate for stronger interactions with M4R. Moreover,
metabolite 23 and metabolite 10 both have the same type of interactions
of ACh and with the same residues in M4R and have shown
the potential for initiating nausea through activation of M4R, as well.

In respect to M5R, metabolite 18, metabolite
22, and
metabolite 23 have better binding affinities for the binding site
of the receptor than the substrate. Metabolite 22 and metabolite 23
make H-bonds and hydrophobic interactions with all of the residues
involved with ACh and both have higher affinities for M5R than ACh (−18.40 and −14.11 kJ/mol, respectively,
vs −4.51 kJ/mol for ACh). Therefore, they can compete with
ACh and affect the function of M5R during chemotherapy
with VLB, causing the onset of nausea.

The ADMET results for
VLB and metabolites have shown that almost
all of them potentially inhibit CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. They could be treated
by CYP3A4 and transported out of the cell by P-gp as well. This could
explain the DDI seen with VLB when a variety of drugs are taken in
concomitance. In addition, drugs that are metabolized by, inhibit
CYP2C8 and/or CYP2C9, and are taken concurrently with VLB also account
for DDI during chemotherapy with VLB. This is because the metabolites
of VLB can also be metabolized by or inhibit these two isoenzymes,
and thus an enzymatic competition is likely to occur.

Among
the VLB metabolites, metabolite 23 interacts the most with
nausea-associated receptors. Its PK properties are important for evaluation
of how this metabolite behaves inside the body. It has an intestinal
solubility (FaSSIF) of 3.70 mg/mL and an affinity for plasma proteins
of 22.8%, thus indicating its availability for off-targets binding.
In addition, it has a Vd of 0.59 L/kg,
showing that it would not be scattered out in the tissues. It is noteworthy
to point out that metabolite 23 has low MW (<400 g/mol) nearly
less than half of VLB. Although metabolite 23 has a low predicted Peff (0.36 cm/s × 104), it is
known that the less a molecule is bound to the plasma proteins, and
the smaller it is, the easier it can traverse the cell membrane and
be considered active to interact with protein-receptors.35 As it was shown earlier, metabolite 23 has affinity
for all nausea-associated receptors in this study, thus supporting
the idea that metabolite 23 can induce the onset of nausea during
chemotherapy with VLB.

Moreover, the calculated data demonstrate
that only a few metabolites
of VLB undergo phase II metabolism through UGT. It is noteworthy that
metabolite 22 and metabolite 23, which display strong binding affinities
and binding profile similar to the substrates for all nausea-associated
receptors, can potentially undergo glucuronidation through catalysis
of UGT2B7. Therefore, their effect within the body must be investigated
as glucuronidation products may cause toxicity. In addition, a few
metabolites of VLB block the hERG receptor involved in cardiotoxic
events and can cross the BBB, thus raising attention for further investigation
on the effects of these metabolites in different organ tissues.

The results suggest that the metabolites formed during excretion
of VLB are likely to be involved in the onset of nausea during chemotherapy
with the vinca alkaloid, potentially through activation of muscarinic
receptors.

In respect with VLB’s target, VLB binds to
tubulin with
a binding energy of −11.23 kJ/mol, whereas the majority of
its metabolites demonstrate better binding energy than the parent
drug, where metabolite 19 has the lowest (best) binding energy. Despite
the interaction of metabolite 19 with Asn329 (α-tubulin) similar
to VLB, it adapts conformation nearly similar to VLB in the vinca
site of tubulin. It interacts with more residues of β-tubulin
than of α-tubulin compared to VLB,29 and thus it induces different conformation to tubulin upon binding.
Further in vitro studies are required to evaluate whether it induces
the same antimitotic effects as VLB. This study is worth developing
because the metabolite possesses ∼65 g/mol less MW than VLB
and the study could be conducted to designing low MW, less chemically
complex VLB analogues, potentially with less ADRs and improved properties
that would meet the requirements in Lipinski’s RO5.6a

Metabolite 8 and metabolite 11 have ADMET
profiles similar to that
of VLB. However, metabolite 10 has a stronger binding energy than
VLB for tubulin (−13.39 kJ/mol vs −11.23 kJ/mol). It
has better PK properties and would be potentially more tolerable than
VLB. Metabolite 10 is unique because it possesses a similar binding
profile of VLB in the tubulin, however, with more acceptable PK profile
than VLB. It has a better gastric and intestinal solubility and is
calculated to be less bound to plasma proteins than VLB. VLB and metabolite
10 share a similar gastric solubility (FaSSGF) 4.65 mg/mL versus 4.61
mg/mL, intestinal solubility (FeSSIF) (2.95 × 10–2 mg/mL vs 3.12 × 10–2 mg/mL), and log P (2.99 vs 3.95), which are all essential drug features
for desired drug bioavailability. Moreover, it is less bound to plasma
proteins than VLB (81.2% vs 89.2%), thus more available throughout
the body.

Metabolite 10, known as 20-hydroxy-VLB, is not a substrate
of CYP2D6
as is VLB and thus is less likely to cause DDI and ADRs than its parent
drug. The in silico ADMET results show that metabolite 10 does not
undergo glucuronidation, and hence it has a phase II metabolism similar
to that of VLB. Moreover, its hydroxyl group added upon metabolism
of VLB suggests that it can also be a candidate as the starting compound
to design the next generation of antimitotic drugs to overcome P-gp-mediated
multidrug resistance often observed with vinca alkaloids.58 This would lead to lower dosage requirements
and thus less aggressive chemotherapy, providing a more target-selective
treatment with diminished ADRs for cancer patients.

4 Materials and Method
4.1 Ligand–Protein Binding
A library
consisting of the structures of VLB and its 35 known metabolites was
built up using SYBYL-X 2.1.1, a commercial molecular modeling and
simulation package developed by Certara. Metabolites were minimized
stepwise using Pullman atomic charges and Tripos force field starting
from 1.0 to 0.001 kJ/mol energy gradient each through 1000 iterations.
In addition, the chemical structures of the natural substrates histamine,
dopamine, and ACh were set to correct protonation states for molecular
docking. The natural endogenous substrates as well as the library
of VLB and metabolites were docked into the binding pocket of each
nausea-associated receptor H1, H3, D2, M1, M4, and M5. Each individual
in silico experiment was carried out using FlexX program embedded
in the LeadIT software package (version 2.1.8). We have previously
performed studies on identifying nausea-associated receptors and simulated
their structure in the absence of crystallographic data by means of
homology modeling. The method and the verification of the structure
qualities of H3R, D2R, M1R, M4R, and M5R studied here have been described elsewhere.6b Briefly, the structures of H3, D2 and M1, M4, and M5 receptors
were determined by means of homology modeling using the Phyre Protein
Homology Recognition Engine.59 D2R was simulated based on the beta-2-adrenergic receptor (PDB entry 2HR1, for additional
details see Flynn et al.,6b), and the muscarinic
receptors were based on the structure of the human M2 muscarinic
ACh receptor as template all with 100% prediction confidence. The
templates were used to model the target proteins using the SWISS-MODEL
workspace.60 After removing atomic clashes
in the simulated structure by energy minimization, the quality of
the structures was assessed using PROCHECK61 and confirmed based on various factors including the high percentage
of the residues in the core regions of the Ramachandran plot.6b

The crystal structure of H1R was retrieved from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 3RZE,20b in which water molecules were removed, side chains and
atom charges were calculated, and protonation states were adjusted
for energy minimization with AMBER7 FF99 force field.

The binding
pocket of H1R can accommodate two different
charge states of the agonist histamine, dicationic with a protonated
imidazole ring and monocationic with a neutral imidazole ring.62 All endogenous substrates of the nausea receptors
(i.e., histamine, dopamine, and ACh)6b have
the amine group in the protonated state and are positively charged.62,63

4.1.1 H1R
The binding pocket
of H1R (PDB 3RZE),20b composed of hydrophobic
residues, is formed by three α-helices: α3 (residues 96–130),
α5 (188–216), and α6 (408–441).6b,20b The crystal structure used for H1R contains the antagonist
doxepin that was used as a reference ligand for the docking experiments
into H1R. A spherical region with a radius of 20 Å
surrounding doxepin was chosen as the target site for molecular docking
of histamine, VLB, and its metabolites.

4.1.2 H3R
The binding pocket
of H3R (UniProtKB Q9Y5N1) is also formed by hydrophobic
interactions that involves helices α3, α4, and α5,
which respectively comprise residues 104–137, 141–178,
and 196–225.6b,20a,64 A spherical region with a radius of 20 Å around residue Asp114
located at α3 was selected as the target site for docking VLB,
its metabolites, and histamine into the binding site of the homology
model of H3R.

4.1.3 D2R
The binding pocket
of D2R (UniProtKB P14416) is located between helices α3
(residues 104–137), α4 (151–171), α5 (187–220),
and α6 (336–369). Asp114 is directly involved in H-bonding
with the endogenous substrate dopamine as well as with known dopaminergic
antagonists (e.g., clozapine) leading to receptor activation and inactivation,
respectively.6b,65 A spherical region with a radius
of 20 Å around Asp114 was defined as the target site for docking
the metabolites, VLB, and dopamine into D2R. However, choosing
the central point for the space encompassing the docking region technically does not have to be based on the role of the
central amino acid but rather the residue’s coordination, such
that the specified sphere around it should cover all the residues
that potentially could involve with a ligand binding.

4.1.4 M1R
The hydrophobic
pocket located at helices α2, α6, and α7 is involved
in the binding of ACh and antagonists into M1R (UniProtKB
P11229) whereas α3, α4, α5, α6, and α7
interact with the anticholinergic agents. To define the binding site
of M1R, a spherical region with a radius of 20 Å around
residue Asp105 was chosen as the target site for docking VLB, its
metabolites, and ACh. Asp105 is involved in the binding of agonists
and antagonists of M1R through electrostatic interactions.6b,66

4.1.5 M4R
For M4R (UniProtKB P08173), a spherical region with a radius of 20 Å
around residue Tyr113 was defined as the target site for docking VLB,
its metabolites, and ACh.66b,67

4.1.6 M5R
The binding site
of M5R (UniProtKB P08912) is located between α2 (residues
62–93), α3 (99–133), α4 (142–166),
α5 (189–215), α6 (435–467), and α7
(472–495). A spherical region with a radius of 20 Å surrounding
residue Asp109 was chosen as the target site for docking the natural
substrate, VLB, and its metabolites. Asp109 is involved in the agonist
and antagonist interactions within M5R.6b,68

4.1.7 Tubulin
The crystal structure of
tubulin was retrieved from PDB with entry code of 4EB6.69 Water molecules were removed, side chains with missing
residues were completed, and atom charges were set as appropriate.
Protonation states were adjusted prior to energy minimization with
AMBER7 FF99 force field. The crystal structure used in this study
(4EB6) is originated from Ovis aries species (sheep). However, the amino acid sequence is more than 90%
similar to the human sequence. The residues known to be involved in
the binding of VLB share 100% sequence identity with Homo sapiens.28,69 The structure of tubulin
crystalized with VLB2b,69 shows that the drug binds to
the interface of β- and α-tubulin. Thus, a spherical region
with a radius of 10 Å surrounding the reference ligand was selected
as the target site for docking.

4.2 In Silico
Prediction of ADMET Properties
In the absence of in vitro
and in vivo data, ADMET Predictor (version
7.2),33 a software package developed by
Simulation Plus, was utilized for predicting the ADMET properties
of the VLB metabolites according to their chemical structure under
pH 7.4. The software provided in silico data for over 140 PK parameters
such as the gastric and intestinal solubility, log P, and the likelihood of drugs crossing the BBB. In addition, it calculated
the affinity for a diverse number of proteins/enzymes or receptors
involved in drug effectiveness and DDI, such as P-gp, plasma proteins,
hERG channel, as well as phases I and II of drug metabolism. This
was performed by assessing the likelihood of compounds binding to
CYP450 enzymes and glucuronosyltransferases (UGT).

Our research
group has recently investigated the ADMET properties of tamoxifen
and its metabolites providing satisfactory results which are in agreement
with previous in vivo and in vitro research.6b In addition, many other research groups have demonstrated in-depth
characterization of the ADMET profiles of promising anti-cancer agents,70 including PK properties of drug metabolites
and their roles in drug toxicity,71 for
which ADMET predictor was utilized as an in silico modeling tool for
prediction of the PK of VLB and its metabolites.
