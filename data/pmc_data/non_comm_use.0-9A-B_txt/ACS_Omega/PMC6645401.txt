Here,
we developed an enzyme assay of manganese peroxidase (MnP)
by capillary electrophoresis using an in-capillary reaction and applied
it to a simultaneous assay of MnP and lignin peroxidase (LiP). The
enzyme activity of MnP was determined from the peak area corresponding
to Mn(III)–malonate produced by the plug–plug reaction
between MnP and Mn(II) in a separation capillary. A background electrolyte
containing 250 mM malonate buffer (pH 4.5) and 5 mM cetyltrimethylammonium
bromide was employed for the separation of Mn(III)–malonate
from MnP at −10 kV after a plug–plug reaction for 5
min. Although the assay permitted the determination of purified MnP,
we found that both LiP and MnP have similar activities against their
substrates, that is, LiP catalyzed the oxidation reaction of Mn(II)
as well as MnP, whereas MnP catalyzed the oxidation reaction of veratryl
alcohol which was the substrate used in the LiP assay developed previously.
Thus, we proposed a method to discriminate MnP from LiP based on the
difference in the activities of these enzymes to each substrate. Amounts
of MnP and LiP in a mixture were successfully evaluated by the proposed
method.

==== Body
Introduction
Lignin-degrading basidiomycete, Phanerochaete chrysosporium (P. chrysosporium), produces enzymes
that catalyze the oxidative depolymerization of lignin.1,2 The enzymes include lignin peroxidase (LiP), manganese peroxidase
(MnP), and their isozymes which help oxidation of lignin directly
and/or indirectly through Mn(III)-mediated oxidation.

These
enzymes are important for degrading aromatic hydrocarbons
not only in nature but also in industry because they facilitate the
decomposition of lignin and its analogues under mild conditions. In
fact, they are expected to be useful in the pulp and paper industry
as a possible alternative to the conventional chlorine bleaching of
chemical pulps.3 The energy industry uses
these enzymes to achieve an optimal biological conversion of lignocellulosic
biomass to biofuels,4 and the mining industry
uses them to improve the recovery of gold by reducing the adsorption
of gold cyanide on the carbonaceous matter found in gold ores via
cleavage of the C–C bond in the carbonaceous matter.5,6

When using the enzymes produced by P. chrysosporium, the quality and activity of the enzymes must be measured, so a
sensitive and accurate enzyme assay is necessary. We previously reported
a method for the determination of LiP using micellar electrokinetic
chromatography coupled with an in-capillary enzymatic reaction. This
method was more sensitive than a conventional spectrophotometric assay
of LiP and permitted the determination of LiP in a culture medium
of P. chrysosporium.7

In a conventional assay of MnP, a spectrophotometric
method is
employed to monitor the enzymatic reaction where Mn(II) is oxidized
to Mn(III) in a medium containing an organic ligand such as lactate
or malonate that forms the complex of Mn(III) with an absorption band
in a UV region.8 The activity of MnP is
determined via an increase in the absorbance of the Mn(III) complex.
However, the spectrophotometric method is only applicable to the assay
of MnP that has been isolated and preconcentrated by gel permeation
chromatography because several interferences in the culture medium
of P. chrysosporium and MnP itself
exhibit absorption in the UV region. Therefore, it is difficult to
measure the Mn(III) complex produced by MnP without purification.

In the present study, we developed an enzyme assay of MnP using
an in-capillary enzymatic reaction followed by separation via capillary
electrophoresis (CE). Solutions of MnP dissolved in water and MnSO4 containing H2O2 and malonate buffer
were injected consecutively into the capillary in which the enzymatic
reaction was conducted for a constant amount of time, which resulted
in a Mn(III)–malonate complex. The complex was separated from
MnP and other components in the sample by applying an electric potential
in a background electrolyte (BGE) containing cetyltrimethylammonium
bromide (CTAB) that accelerated the migration of the anionic Mn(III)–malonate
complex by reversing the electroosmotic flow. The enzyme assay permitted
the determination of activity for standard MnP solutions.

Conversely,
we found that LiP had enzymatic activity similar to
that of MnP, that is, LiP catalyzed the oxidation of Mn(II), whereas
MnP catalyzed the oxidation of veratryl alcohol, which is a substrate
of LiP. Therefore, the activity of MnP would be overestimated in the
presence of LiP and vice versa. Thus, we proposed a method to discriminate
MnP from LiP in the mixture of enzymes by using two enzymatic assays
for MnP and LiP. We demonstrated how the method can be used to successfully
measure the amounts of both MnP and LiP in a mixture without purification
of the enzymes.

Results and Discussion
Determination of Mn(III)–Malonate
In a conventional
enzyme assay, Mn(III) is complexed with organic ligands because organic
ligands form stable Mn(III) complexes with UV absorption. In this
study, malonate ion was selected because it has an absorption maximum
that is larger than that of other ligands such as oxalate, lactate,
tartrate, and malate.8 However, when using
a malonate buffer with pH 4.5, which is the optimum for an enzymatic
reaction,9 the electroosmotic flow is too
slow to detect anionic species under conventional CE conditions where
the BGE flows from anode to cathode by electroosmosis. In fact, our
preliminary results indicated that Mn(III)–malonate was anionic
and its migration time was too long to be detected at pH 4.5. Therefore,
we added a cationic surfactant, CTAB, to reverse the direction of
the electroosmotic flow and applied a negative potential at the inlet
of the capillary. No significant difference in the migration time
of Mn(III)–malonate was observed in a concentration of CTAB
that ranged from 0.5 to 10 mM, so 5 mM CTAB was employed in the present
study. A sharp peak of Mn(III)–malonate was observed when using
a BGE that consisted of 250 mM malonate buffer and 5 mM CTAB, as shown
in Figure 1. However,
the peak area gradually decreased with an increase in the time following
the preparation of the sample solution (Figure 1a–c), probably because of the disproportional
reaction of Mn(III).10

the Mn(III)–malonate complex. (a) 62,
(b) 144, and (c) 226 min after the preparation of the sample solution.
BGE, 250 mM malonate buffer with 5 mM CTAB (pH 4.5); sample, 187 μM
Mn(CH3COO)3 dissolved in 250 mM malonate buffer
(pH 4.5); and voltage, −10 kV.

Therefore, we evaluated the disproportional reaction of Mn(III)
by measuring the time dependence of the decreased peak area. Standard
solutions of Mn(III) with different concentrations were prepared with
a 250 mM malonate buffer at pH 4.5. After completely dissolving Mn(III)
acetate in the 250 mM malonate buffer, the solution was injected into
the capillary in a time interval of 6 min. The first injection was
carried out at 15 min because it takes more than 10 min to dissolve
Mn(III) acetate in the 250 mM malonate buffer. The disproportional
reaction of Mn(III) was approximated to the first-order reaction by
plotting the logarithm of the peak area to time. At concentrations
of 0.187, 0.373, 0.533, and 0.761 mM Mn(III)–malonate, the
logarithm of the decreased peak areas was plotted against time, resulting
in good linear relationships. Therefore, the intercepts of the lines
should indicate the peak areas at t = 0.

The
relationship between the concentrations of Mn(III)–malonate
and the peak areas obtained from the intercepts showed good linearity
with a correlation coefficient of 0.9923. We employed the calibration
curve for determining the amount of Mn(III) produced by the enzymatic
reaction of MnP to correct the influence of the disproportional reaction
of Mn(III) during the preparation of the standard solutions. The limits
of detection and quantification for Mn(III)–malonate were estimated
to be 11.9 μM at S/N = 3 and 40.9 μM at S/N = 10, respectively.

Enzyme Assay of MnP
In the enzyme assay of MnP, a standard
solution of MnP was sandwiched by a substrate solution containing
MnSO4 and H2O2. The injection times
were optimized using a program for the simulation of transverse diffusion
of laminar flow profiles11 that was developed
by Krylov.12 We selected injection times
for the front substrate plug, the enzyme plug, and the back substrate
plug of 5, 5, and 8 s, respectively.

When a standard solution
of MnP was reacted with Mn(II), the electrophoretic run was begun
immediately. The electropherogram obtained by the reaction between
MnP and Mn(II) is shown in Figure 2, where a peak of Mn(III)–malonate produced
by the in-capillary enzymatic reaction can be found clearly. In Figure 2, the peak of MnP
(peak 2) is broadened because proteins adsorb on the surface of the
capillary as shown in an early study on CE separations.13,14 The migration time corresponded to the Mn(III)–malonate complex
prepared by dissolving Mn(III) acetate in a 250 mM malonate buffer,
and the peak was increased by increasing the reaction time from 5
to 50 min. These facts indicate that the peak detected at around 2
min was produced by the enzymatic reaction.

Figure 2 Electropherogram obtained
by the in-capillary enzymatic reaction
between MnP and Mn(II). 1 = Mn(III)–malonate complex; 2 = MnP;
injection times: 5 s for the first substrate solution, 5 s for 1 mg
mL–1 MnP, and 8 s for the second substrate solution;
and reaction time: 20 min. Other conditions are the same as in Figure 1.

Simultaneous Determination of MnP and LiP
As shown
in Figure 2, the Mn(III)–malonate
complex produced by the enzymatic reaction can be detected using an
in-capillary reaction. However, it is known that MnP and LiP have
poor specificity to substrates, that is, these enzymes can catalyze
the oxidation reactions of several compounds.15−17 Therefore,
if LiP reacts with Mn(II) to produce Mn(III) or MnP catalyzes the
oxidation reaction of veratryl alcohol, which is the substrate employed
in the LiP assay, it would be impossible to determine the individual
enzymes by the proposed method.

Thus, we evaluated the activities
of LiP to Mn(II) and MnP to veratryl alcohol. Figure 3 shows the electropherograms for MnP and
LiP using veratryl alcohol and Mn(II) as the substrates, respectively.
The results indicate that both MnP and LiP catalyze the oxidations
of veratryl alcohol and Mn(II). Therefore, when a sample contains
both MnP and LiP, MnP cannot be discriminated from LiP by the MnP
assay and vice versa.

Figure 3 Electropherograms obtained by the enzyme assays using
Mn(II) and
veratryl alcohol as the substrates. (a) substrate, veratryl alcohol;

Mn(II); enzyme, 5 mg mL–1 LiP; BGE, 50 mM tartrate
with 50 mM SDS (pH 2.5); and reaction time, 5 min.

The kinetic parameters of the enzymes, including Km, Vmax, and kcat, were calculated using two substrates, veratryl
alcohol
and Mn(II), according to the Lineweaver–Burk plot, as shown
in Table 1. The Km and kcat values
for MnP (substrate, Mn(II)) and for LiP (substrate, veratryl alcohol)
are in good agreement with the reported values,17 whereas the activities (Vmax) are significantly small. The small Vmax values might be attributed to the lack of purity of the standard
enzymes or to the degradation of the enzymes during the storage period.

To
determine the individual enzymes in a mixture, we proposed a
method for the simultaneous determination of MnP and LiP using two
enzyme assays, that is, the CE enzyme assays for MnP and LiP. Here,
we describe how 1 mg of MnP and LiP produces XMnP mol and XLiP mol of Mn(III)
and YMnP mol and YLiP mol of veratraldehyde. When a mixture contains A mg of MnP and B mg of LiP, the amounts
of the products, Mn(III) and veratraldehyde, are given by 1   2  where NMn(III) and NVAld are the moles of Mn(III) and
veratraldehyde produced by the enzymatic reactions. Therefore, if
we know XMnP, XLiP, YMnP, and YLiP, A and B can be calculated by
solving eqs 1 and 2, that is, MnP and LiP are determined simultaneously.

The relationship between the amounts of the enzymes and the products
produced by the enzymatic reactions is shown in Figure 4. Surprisingly, LiP exhibited higher activity
in the oxidation of Mn(II) than MnP and vice versa in the oxidation
of veratryl alcohol. The slopes in Figure 4 represent XMnP, XLiP, YMnP, and YLiP with the values of 0.0065,
0.040, 0.036, and 0.011 pmol ng–1, respectively
(the reaction times were consistent at 5 min).

Figure 4 Relationship between
the amounts of enzymes and the products obtained
by the enzymatic reactions. Substrates: (a) Mn(II) and (b) veratryl
alcohol. The enzyme assays used in (a, b) were developed in this study
and in the previous study,7 respectively.
Reaction time, 5 min; VAld indicates veratraldehyde.

When a mixture of 5 mg mL–1 MnP
and 5 mg mL–1 LiP was reacted with Mn(II) and veratryl
alcohol,
the amounts of Mn(III) and veratraldehyde were 2.74 and 1.75 pmol,
respectively. According to eqs 1 and 2, the concentrations of the enzymes
using the experimental values were calculated at 3.8 mg mL–1 for MnP and 7.8 mg mL–1 for LiP. Therefore, the
proposed method could be employed to estimate the amounts of MnP and
LiP in a mixture sample without purification of each enzyme, although
each concentration would deviate slightly from the expected value
(5 mg mL–1).

Conclusions
Here,
we developed a CE enzyme assay of MnP using Mn(II) as a substrate.
The method is applicable to the determination of MnP when the sample
does not contain LiP. However, we found that LiP had an activity that
was similar to that of MnP, resulting in Mn(III) by catalyzing the
oxidation reaction of Mn(II), that is, the developed method cannot
be employed for a sample containing both MnP and LiP. In addition,
MnP also oxidized veratryl alcohol to veratraldehyde which is the
product of the enzyme assay for LiP. Surprisingly, MnP showed higher
activity in the oxidation of veratryl alcohol compared with LiP, but
LiP was more efficient in the oxidation of Mn(II) than MnP. To discriminate
MnP from LiP in the mixture, the enzyme assays for MnP and LiP can
be combined because their activities are different in the oxidation
reactions of Mn(II) and veratryl alcohol. Two enzyme assays successfully
permitted the simultaneous determination of MnP and LiP in a mixture
sample. Therefore, the present enzyme assays are a promising method
for the determination of enzymes in practical samples containing both
MnP and LiP without separation and purification. Finally, it is noteworthy
that this simultaneous determination method is, in principle, applicable
to a sample containing more than two enzymes with different substrate
selectivities, but the number of different substrates must equal the
number of enzymes.

Experimental Section
Materials
All
chemicals were of analytical grade and
were used without further purification. Deionized water was prepared
by means of an Elix water purification system (Millipore Co. Ltd.,
Molsheim, France). Standards of MnP and LiP were purchased from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, TX). Hydrogen peroxide was purchased from
Kanto Chemical (Tokyo, Japan). Malonic acid was obtained from Nacalai
Tesque, Inc. (Kyoto, Japan). Ethanol was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
Japan (Tokyo, Japan). Manganese(II) sulfate pentahydrate was purchased
from Kishida Chemical Co. (Osaka, Japan). Veratryl alcohol was obtained
from Tokyo Kasei Kogyo (Tokyo, Japan). The other reagents were purchased
from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan).

For the assay of MnP,
a malonate buffer solution (250 mM, pH 4.5) was prepared by dissolving
an appropriate amount of malonic acid and adjusting the pH using 1
M sodium hydroxide solution. A malonate buffer solution that included
5 mM CTAB was employed as a BGE. The BGE was prepared by dissolving
0.25 mmol CTAB in 50 mL of the buffer solution. The change in pH after
the addition of CTAB was less than ±0.1 pH. The standards of
MnP and LiP were dissolved with water. Standard solutions of Mn(III)–malonate
were prepared by dissolving appropriate amounts of Mn(III) acetate
in a 250 mM malonate buffer. The standard solutions were prepared
freshly in all experiments. A mixture containing 2 mM Mn(II) sulfate
and 0.2 mM H2O2 was prepared with the malonate
buffer without CTAB (pH 4.5) for use as the substrate solution in
the in-capillary reaction.

The solutions used for the assay
of LiP were similar to those reported
previously.7 Briefly, a tartrate buffer
solution that included 50 mM sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was employed
as a BGE, and a mixture containing 2 mM veratryl alcohol and 0.4 mM
H2O2 was prepared with a tartrate buffer without
SDS (pH 2.5) for use as the substrate solution in the in-capillary
reaction.

Apparatus
A CE system, model 3DCE (Agilent
Technologies, CA, USA), was used throughout the study. Fused-silica
capillaries with an i.d. of 50 μm and an o.d. of 375 μm
(total length, 33.5 cm; effective length, 25 cm) were obtained from
GL Sciences (Tokyo, Japan). The capillaries were flushed with 0.1
M NaOH and water successively for 5 min before each run, followed
by filling with the BGE.

In the MnP assay, absorbance at 270
nm represented the absorption maxima of Mn(III)–malonate and
was recorded to obtain the electropherograms. To prevent deactivation
of MnP, the temperature in the autosampler of the CE system was maintained
at 7 °C (the controllable lowest temperature), whereas the temperature
of the capillary was controlled at 25 °C for the enzyme reaction,
that is, the Mn(III)–malonate complexes are formed at 25 °C.
The solutions of the enzyme and the substrate were injected in the
order of the substrate for 5 s, the enzyme for 5 s, and the substrate
for 5 or 8 s at 3.5 kPa. The injection volume of the enzyme corresponded
to 7.62 nL, which was calculated using the Poiseuille equation, and
the viscosity of the BGE was measured at 25 °C by an Ostwald
viscometer (ηr = 1.052). The amounts and concentrations
of the product and enzyme were calculated using an injection volume
of 7.62 nL. Electropherograms were recorded via Hewlett-Packard ChemStation
software, which permitted an automatic measurement of peak height,
peak area, and migration time. The LiP assay was conducted according
to the procedure in our previous paper.7

Enzyme Assay for MnP
The method consisted of a plug–plug
reaction between MnP and its substrate, Mn(II), the separation of
the product, Mn(III)–malonate, from the other components including
the enzyme and the culture medium, and the determination of the enzyme
activity from the peak area of Mn(III)–malonate produced by
the plug–plug reaction. Initially, the capillary was filled
with the BGE containing 250 mM malonate buffer and 5 mM CTAB (pH 4.5
± 0.1). The plug–plug reaction was accomplished by introducing
plugs in the following order: substrate—enzyme—substrate.
The substrate plug consisted of 2 mM MnSO4, 0.2 mM H2O2, and 250 mM malonate buffer (pH 4.5) without
CTAB. The substrate, Mn(II), was reacted with MnP for 5–50
min by diffusion-based mixing in the capillary for its conversion
to Mn(III)–malonate. The enzyme activity was directly calculated
from the peak area of Mn(III)–malonate produced by the in-capillary
reaction.
