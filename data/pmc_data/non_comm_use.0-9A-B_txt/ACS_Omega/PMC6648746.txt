The present study
aimed to improve the adsorption characteristics
of the pristine layered double hydroxide (LDH) by physicochemical
modification using polyethylene glycol (PEG400), a nontoxic
hydrophilic polymer. With this objective, LDH was synthesized and
modified with different concentrations of PEG400. The PEG-modified
LDHs (LDH/PEGs) were characterized using X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric
analysis, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area and porosity
measurement, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy,
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and zeta potential measurements.
The adsorption properties of the pristine LDH (PLDH) and the LDH/PEGs
were studied for the removal of Acid Orange II from water, and the
results were compared. The PLDH treated with 15% PEG solution showed
∼30% increase in adsorption capacity as compared to the PLDH.
The adsorption isotherm data were analyzed using Langmuir, Freundlich,
and Temkin isotherm models. The values of thermodynamic parameters
such as ΔS and ΔH showed
the spontaneous and endothermic nature of the adsorption process.
The adsorption kinetics data for both PLDH and the LDH/PEG adsorbents
presented a good fit to the pseudo-second-order kinetic model.

1 Introduction
Dyes
are the most significant contaminant among various industrial
pollutants. Several dyes and their decomposition products are toxic
to living organisms and are generally not removed from wastewater
by conventional wastewater treatment systems. Therefore, excessive
use of dyes/colorants has largely contributed to the environmental
pollution. A number of technologies have been developed and implemented
for the purpose of removing dye/colorants from wastewater,1−3 including adsorption,4 coagulation/flocculation,5 advanced oxidation processes,6 membrane-based technologies,7 and biological treatment processes.8 However,
among these methods, adsorption has become one of the most effective
and low-cost methods for removing dyes/colorants from wastewater.4 A wide spectrum of adsorbents, such as carbon-based
materials,9 clay and its composites,10,11 waste material,12 natural/synthetic polymers,13 magnetic materials,14 inorganic nanomaterials,15 functionalized
MOFs,16 and so forth, have been explored
for this purpose. In order to achieve the desired water quality and
for a sustainable water treatment technology, a careful selection
of adsorbents is paramount.

Layered double hydroxides (LDHs),
also named as hydrotalcite-like
compounds, are a family of inorganic layered materials with positively
charged metal hydroxide layers and interlayer balancing anions.17 Because of the presence of large interlayer
spaces and a reasonable number of exchangeable anions, they act as
potential ion exchangers/adsorbents.18,19 Interactions
of polymer molecules with the LDH structure forming LDH/polymer (nano)composites
with interesting physical and chemical properties are being explored
for various applications by several research groups.20−22 In the recent decade, an increasing number of reports on synthesis
and application of various LDH/polymer (nano)composites shows that
these materials have promising future; however, application of these
materials in water treatment is limited.

In the present study,
polyethylene glycol (PEG400),
a nontoxic hydrophilic polymer, has been explored for physicochemical
modification of Mg/Al LDH (Mg/Al molar ratio 2) with the aim to increase
the adsorption performance of the LDH. The present communication reports
synthesis of PEG-modified LDHs with varying concentrations of PEG400, their physicochemical characterization and adsorption
behavior for the azo dye, Acid Orange II (AO-II) in aqueous medium.
The influence of various parameters such as concentration of PEG used,
adsorption temperature, initial dye concentration, contact/adsorption
time, and solution pH, on the dye adsorption characteristics of the
LDH/PEG is systematically investigated.

2 Results
and Discussions
2.1 Characterization
Chemical analysis
results of the pristine LDH (PLDH) and LDH/PEGs (Table 1) show that all the adsorbents
exhibit a Mg/Al molar ratio close to two. The carbon content in the
adsorbents increased in the order PLDH < LDH/PEG-15 < LDH/PEG-25
which indicates attachment of more PEG molecules with the PLDH on
increase in the PEG concentration. The traces of carbon detected in
the PLDH may be due to the absorption of atmospheric carbon dioxide
during synthesis. The occurrence of nitrogen in the PLDH and in the
LDH/PEG is due to the presence of surface and interstitial nitrate
ions from the precursor salts. The nitrogen content in the LDH/PEG
decreased with increase in the PEG concentration, which indicates
that more and more nitrate ions of the PLDH are exchanged by the PEG400 during reaction.

Table 1 Chemical Compositions
of the PLDH
and LDH/PEG Adsorbents
adsorbent	Mg (%)	Al (%)	C (%)	H (%)	N (%)	
PLDH	15.08	8.32	0.28	2.65	5.01	
LDH/PEG-5	13.73	6.78	4.23	2.90	4.82	
LDH/PEG-15	14.83	7.95	3.75	2.78	4.76	
LDH/PEG-25	10.54	5.82	6.21	3.30	3.90	
LDH/PEG-50	10.32	5.65	5.96	3.22	3.82	
The X-ray diffraction patterns of the PLDH and LDH/PEGs presented
in Figure 1 exhibit
the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns typical of synthetic LDHs. The
XRD patterns show sharp and pointed diffraction peaks at 2θ
positions 10.8, 21.6, 34.5, 38.4, 45.1, 60.6, and 61.8° due to
the 003, 006, 012, 015, 018, 110, and 113 diffraction planes, respectively.23 The unit cell parameters, c and a, estimated from the positions of the (003)
(c = 3d003) and (110)
(a = 2d110) reflections
are 2.46 and 0.305 nm, respectively. These values agree with those
reported in the literature for Mg/Al LDHs with nitrate as interlayer
anions and having a Mg/Al molar ratio close to 2.19 The values of basal spacing (d003) for the PLDH, LDH/PEG-5, LDH/PEG-15, LDH/PEG-25, and LDH/PEG-50
are 0.820, 0.797, 0.798, 0.797, and 0.785 nm, respectively. The close
values of basal spacing of the PLDH and the LDH/PEGs show no significant
change in the basic crystal structure of the LDH on treatment with
PEG400. The sharp peaks signify the high crystalline nature
of the LDH/PEGs similar to that of the PLDH.

Figure 1 X-ray diffraction patterns
of the PLDH and the LDH/PEG adsorbents.

The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curves of the PLDH and
LDH/PEGs
generally show decrease in residual mass with increase in the PEG
concentration in the composites (Figure 2). The TG curve of the PLDH is divided into
two mass loss steps. The weight loss below 150 °C is ca. 6.2%
and is attributed mainly to the loss of physically adsorbed water
molecules. In the second step between 300 and 550 °C, the weight
loss is ca. 26%, resulting from the dehydroxylation and elimination
of intercalated ions and water molecules, after which the LDH loses
its characteristic layered structure.24 The weight loss in the LDH/PEGs took place primarily in two steps,
as marked by the exothermic peaks in the DTG curves, between 50 to
210 and 210 to 500 °C.

Figure 2 TGA and derivative TGA (DTG) profiles of the
PLDH and LDH/PEG adsorbents.

The weight loss between 50 and 210 °C is due to the
loss of
physisorbed water molecules and the decomposition of free PEG molecules.
The larger mass loss of approximately 33 to 42% of the total mass
appeared in the temperature range 210–500 °C for the LDH/PEGs
corresponding to the decomposition of PEG molecules, dehydroxylation,
and elimination of intercalated anions. The TGA data indicate relatively
lower thermal stability of the layered structure of the LDH/PEGs than
that of the PLDH. The total weight loss recorded at 800 °C for
the PLDH, LDH/PEG-5, LDH/PEG-15, LDH/PEG-25, and LDH/PEG-50 are 33.7,
50.2, 48.6, 58.9, and 56.7%, respectively.

The scanning electron
microscopic (SEM) images of the PLDH and
LDH/PEG-15 show flake-like particles having an average dimension less
than 100 nm (Figure 3a,b). Figure 3 clearly
shows that the stacked particles of PLDH (Figure 3a) got exfoliated in the LDH/PEG-15 (Figure 3b) after treatment
with PEG400. The transmission electron microscopic (TEM)
images (Figure 3c–f)
show the hexagonal flake-like particles of the adsorbent having a
dimension between 50 and 80 nm. TEM images clearly show the agglomerated
particles in PLDH (Figure 3c,e), whereas dispersed particles in LDH/PEG-15 (Figure 3d,f).

Figure 3 SEM images (a,b) and
TEM images (c–f) of the (a,c,e) PLDH
and (b,d,f) LDH/PEG-15.

The specific surface areas of PLDH and LDH/PEG-15 are 101.2
and
107.9 m2/g, respectively, while the total pore volumes
of both PLDH and LDH/PEG-15 are the same (0.22 cc/g). The identical
shape of the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms for the
PLDH and LDH/PEG-15 (Figure S1) indicates
that the pore structures of the two adsorbents are analogous. The
adsorption hysteresis relates to the type IV isotherm of the IUPAC
classification of physisorption which are characteristics of the mesoporous
materials.25 The BJH desorption curves
(Figure S1) show two different pore sizes
(2.3 and 3.5 nm) of the PLDH, which merged into one (3.5 nm) in LDH/PEG-15.
This indicates that the relatively smaller pores of the PLDH are filled
with the PEG in LDH/PEG-15. The high surface area, mesoporous nature,
and nano-size pores signify good adsorption characteristics of these
adsorbents.

The zeta potential (ζ) is an important parameter
to evaluate
the surface charge and dispersity of an adsorbent. The zeta potential
(ζ) values of the PLDH, LDH/PEG-15, LDH/PEG-25, and LDH/PEG-50
in water are 35.9 ± 2.1, 37.3 ± 1.4, 37.1 ± 1.1, and
37.9 ± 0.5 mV, respectively. The zeta potential values indicate
that no chemical interaction takes place between PLDH and PEG400 under the reaction conditions of the present study.

2.2 Influence of the PEG400 Concentration
on Dye Removal
Adsorption of AO-II by the LDH/PEGs prepared
using different PEG400 concentrations is compared with
that of the PLDH in Figure 4 (0% PEG represents PLDH). The LDH/PEGs invariably show higher
dye adsorption capacity than that of the PLDH, while PEG400 itself has no competence for AO-II adsorption–decomposition.
Nevertheless, the concentration of PEG400 used for making
LDH/PEGs has significant influence on their adsorption capacity. An
increase in the PEG400 concentration from 5 to 25% leads
to an enhanced adsorption capacity; however, a further increase in
the PEG400 concentration above 25% has a detrimental effect
on the adsorption capacity. Yet, the increase in adsorption capacity
from LDH/PEG-15 to LDH/PEG-25 is marginal with respect to the increase
in the PEG400 concentration. Hence, a detailed adsorption
study was performed using LDH/PEG-15 and the results were compared
with those of the PLDH.

Figure 4 Influence of the PEG400 concentration
on the AO-II adsorption
capacity of the LDH/PEG adsorbents (initial AO-II concentration: 200
mg/L, amount of the adsorbent: 0.5 g/L, contact time: 6 h, temperature:
30 °C).

2.3 Adsorption
Kinetics
The decrease
in the AO-II concentration as a function of reaction time at two different
concentrations of AO-II for the PLDH and the LDH/PEG-15 is presented
in Figure 5. A large
decrease in the AO-II concentration indicates better adsorption capacity
of the LDH/PEG-15. The improvement in adsorption capacity in LDH/PEG-15
is more pronounced in the higher AO-II concentration. The adsorption
of AO-II by the PLDH and LDH/PEG-15 are 48.9 and 86%, respectively,
when the initial concentration of AO-II is 200 mg/L. The kinetic data
were fitted to a pseudo-second-order kinetic model proposed by Ho
and McKay.26 The pseudo-second-order kinetic
equation is given below 1  where t is the time in minutes, qt is the amount of adsorbate
per unit gram of the adsorbent at time t, qe has the same meaning as mentioned in previous
section, and k2 is the pseudo second-order
rate constant.

Figure 5 AO-II adsorption kinetics of the PLDH and the LDH/PEG-15
at two
different concentrations of AO-II (AO-II concentration: 100 and 200
mg/L, amount of the adsorbent: 0.5 g/L, contact time: 0–6 h,
temperature: 30 °C).

The pseudo-second-order kinetic constants calculated from
the slope
and intercept of the linearized plot of the eq 1 (Figure S2) are
presented in Table 2 along with their correlation coefficients.

Table 2 Pseudo
Second-Order Kinetic Constants
for AO-II Adsorption on PLDH and LDH/PEG-15
adsorbent	C0 (mg/L)	qe,exp (mg/g)	pseudo second-order model	
 	 	 	qe,cal (mg/g)	k2 [g/(mg·min)]	R2	
PLDH	100	131.5	142.8	1.43 × 10–4	0.98	
 	200	195.3	212.8	0.97 × 10–4	0.99	
LDH/PEG-15	100	181.8	196.1	1.65 × 10–4	0.99	
 	200	339.6	370.4	0.82 × 10–4	0.99	
The values
of the correlation coefficient (R2) indicate
excellent fitting of the kinetic data with the
pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The value of the second-order rate
constant (k2) decreased with an increase
in the initial dye concentration. Reports from other research groups
also proposed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model as the suitable
model for adsorption of dyes on pristine and calcined LDHs.23,27 This result indicates a strong interaction between the AO-II and
the adsorbents.27

2.4 Adsorption
Isotherm
The influence
of the initial AO-II concentration on the adsorption capacity of the
adsorbents was studied at three different temperatures, 30, 40, and
50 °C, and by varying the initial AO-II concentration from 200
to 800 mg/L (Figure S3). The equilibrium
adsorption capacities increased with increase in the initial AO-II
concentration and with increase in temperature. At all the reaction
temperatures, the adsorption capacity of LDH/PEG-15 is much higher
than that of the PLDH.

The equilibrium adsorption data were
fitted to the Langmuir,28 Freundlich,29 and Temkin,30 isotherm
models. The linearized form of the Langmuir (eq 2), Freundlich (eq 3), and Temkin (eq 4) isotherm models used in the present study
is given below 2  where Ce and qe have the same meaning as mentioned
in the
previous section, and bL and Vm are Langmuir isotherm constants representing respectively
adsorption bond energy and monolayer adsorption capacity. 3  where n and k are Freundlich isotherm
constants. The constant n represents adsorption intensity
and k represents
adsorption capacity. 4  and B = RT/bT, where B is a constant
related to the heat of adsorption, A is the equilibrium
binding constant (L/mg), R is the universal gas constant
(8.314 J/mol/K), and T is the temperature in absolute
scale (K).

The values of isotherm constants for each isotherm
model were determined
from the slope and intercept of the linearized plot of the respective
isotherm equations. The values of various isotherm constants and their
corresponding correlation coefficients (R2) at three different experimental temperatures are listed in Table 3. The values of Langmuir
constant Vm, representing monolayer adsorption
capacity, for both PLDH and LDH/PEG-15 are very close to those of
the experimental values. Nevertheless, the AO-II adsorption capacity
of the LDH/PEG-15 is much higher than that of the PLDH. The monolayer
adsorption capacity of AO-II on the PLDH and the LDH/PEG-15 at 30
°C is 490.2 and 625.0 mg/g, respectively. The low values of the
Langmuir constant bL, representing adsorption
bond energy, indicate the physical nature of the adsorption of AO-II
on PLDH and LDH/PEG-15. The values of the Freundlich constant n greater than one (>1) represents good adsorption characteristics
of the LDH/PEG-15 for the adsorption of AO-II.31 The values of correlation coefficients indicate suitability
of the Langmuir isotherm model for the present adsorbent–adsorbate
system.

The plots of adsorption isotherms obtained using the values of
constants from linearized plots of the Langmuir, Freundlich, and Temkin
isotherm models, and the experimental isotherm data are presented
in Figure 6. The qe value for each isotherm model was calculated
using the isotherm constants from Table 3 and the respective isotherm equations. In
the Langmuir isotherm, the experimental isotherm data (data points)
fitted reasonably well with the isotherm model (solid lines) over
the wide range of concentration and in all the three experimental
temperatures. In the case of the Freundlich isotherm, the experimental
isotherm data and the isotherm model are in good agreement in the
lower concentrations but deviate more and more with the increase in
the adsorbate concentration. The Temkin isotherm model fails to provide
the realistic adsorption capacity value and hence cannot be utilized
for the present adsorbent–adsorbate system. Hence, the Langmuir
isotherm model can be considered as the most suitable model for AO-II
adsorption on PLDH and LDH/PEG adsorbents.

of PLDH and LDH/PEG-15 in water at different
temperatures obtained using Langmuir, Freundlich, and Temkin isotherm
models (the data points indicate experimental values and the solid
lines indicate model fittings).

To evaluate the AO-II adsorption performance of the LDH/PEG-15,
the adsorption capacity value from the present study was compared
to that of the other reported adsorbent materials and is summarized
in Table 4. The reaction
conditions like initial dye concentration and contact time are also
included in Table 4 for proper assessment.

The data
in Table 4 show that
our adsorbents exhibit good adsorption capacities at reasonably
high initial dye concentrations. Moreover, the time taken to achieve
this adsorption capacity value by the LDH/PEG-15 is much less than
that for the other reported adsorbents. The reaction/contact time
is an important parameter for feasibility of any real-life water treatment
system. The less the contact time, the more is the efficiency of the
water treatment system. Hence, in terms of adsorption capacity and
contact time, the present LDH/PEG-15 adsorbent is exceptional to the
other adsorbents reported for removal of AO-II dye from water.

2.5 Adsorption Thermodynamics
In order
to understand the thermodynamic nature of the present adsorbent–adsorbate
system at varying temperatures, thermodynamic parameters such as the
change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG), enthalpy
(ΔH), and entropy (ΔS) were calculated using the following equations 5   6  where Kd = qe/Ce, R is the universal gas constant (8.314
J/mol/K), T is the temperature in absolute scale
(K), and Kd is the adsorption
distribution co-efficient
(L/g).

The values of ΔH and ΔS were calculated from the slope and intercepts of the van’t
Hoff plot for ln(Kd) versus 1/T (Figure S4) and are presented
in Table 5. The value
of ΔH (<80 kJ/mol) signifies the physical
nature of the present adsorption process. The positive value of ΔH and ΔS indicates endothermic nature
and spontaneity of the present adsorbent–adsorbate system.
The negative value of the free energy (ΔG),
which again decreased with increase in temperature, indicates that
the adsorption process is feasible and thermodynamically spontaneous
at higher temperatures. Similar results were reported by Li et al.
(2009) for the adsorption of 2-nitroaniline onto activated carbon
prepared from cotton stalk fiber.37

Table 5 Values of the Thermodynamic Parameters
for Adsorption of AO-II on LDH/PEG-15
adsorbent	ΔH kJ/mol	ΔS J/mol/K	–ΔG (kJ/mol)	
 	 	 	30 °C	40 °C	50 °C

2.6 Influence of Solution pH
The influence
of solution pH on the AO-II adsorption by the LDH/PEG-15 was studied
in the solution pH range between 2 and 10. The AO-II adsorption capacity
of LDH/PEG-15 changed between 230.5 and 333.5 mg/g on varying the
solution pH between 2.1 and 10 (Figure S5). The adsorption capacities are not significantly affected by the
solution pH between 4 and 9.1. However, the maximum adsorption was
achieved at the normal pH of the AO-II solution (pH ≈ 6.2).
The slight decrease in adsorption capacity at pH < 4 may be due
to the dissolution of the metal hydroxides of the adsorbents in the
acidic solution. The observed decrease in adsorption capacity on moving
toward the alkaline medium may be due to the increase in the concentration
of the competitive hydroxyl ion (OH–) in the solution.
It is interesting to observe that the equilibrium pH values of the
solutions recorded after 2 h of adsorption are between 6.1 and 7.9,
though the initial pH values of the solutions were between 3 and 9.1.
This kind of buffering action of the LDH has been previously observed
and reported by our research group.38 The
present study reveals that the buffering property of the PLDH is retained
even in the LDH/PEG-15.

2.7 Desorption and Regeneration
Studies
Desorption of AO-II from the AO-II adsorbed LDH/PEG-15
in the alkaline
and neutral aqueous medium was studied at 28 °C as a function
of time, and the results are presented in Figure 7a. After 24 h of contact, a maximum of 22.6
and 5.1% desorption was observed in 0.05 M NaOH solution and in water,
respectively. The low desorption of AO-II from the adsorbent is attributed
to the confinement of the AO-II in the interlayer space of the layered
structure.

Figure 7 (a) Desorption of AO-II from the AO-II-adsorbed LDH/PEG-15 in the
alkaline and neutral aqueous medium at 28 °C as a function of time and (b)
AO-II adsorption on the fresh and the regenerated LDH/PEG-15.

Regeneration of an adsorbent is
practically important for its re-use
in removing pollutants from water. Because of the very low desorption
of AO-II in the alkaline medium, the regeneration of the adsorbent
was tested by thermal treatment instead of the chemical method. Adsorption
studies were performed using the thermally regenerated23 adsorbent LDH/PEG-15 for four cycles (R1 to R4), and the
results are presented in Figure 7b. R0 represents the adsorption
by fresh adsorbents. Figure 7b shows that there is ∼18% loss in adsorption capacity
in the first regeneration cycle after which there is not much decrease
in the adsorption capacity up to the fourth regeneration cycles. These
results reveal that the thermal regeneration of the used adsorbent
is feasible at least up to first four cycles.

2.8 Mechanism
of AO-II Uptake by the LDH/PEG Adsorbent
Although there is
no significant difference in the crystal structure,
surface area, and porosity between the PLDH and the LDH/PEG-15 adsorbents,
the remarkable increase in the adsorption capacity of the PLDH on
treatment with PEG400 needs further elucidation. To understand
the AO-II adsorption mechanism of the PLDH and LDH/PEG-15 adsorbents,
the AO-II-loaded adsorbents (800 mg/L AO-II) were collected, washed,
and dried, after which FTIR spectra and XRD patterns of the samples
were recorded. Figure 8 shows the XRD patterns and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra
of the adsorbents recorded before and after adsorption.

Figure 8 (a) XRD patterns
of the AO-II-loaded adsorbents and (b) FTIR spectra
of the adsorbents before and after adsorption. The inset of figure
(b) shows the amplified FTIR spectrum between 1000 and 2000 cm–1.

The XRD patterns of the
AO-II-loaded adsorbents were recorded in
the 2θ range from 2 to 32° and compared with that of the
PLDH in Figure 8a.
The two harmonic peaks at 2θ positions 10.6 and 21.7° (in
PLDH) correspond to the d-spacings 0.82 and 0.41
nm, respectively, are characteristic of an LDH with a nitrate interlayer
ion. However, in the XRD patterns of the AO-II-loaded adsorbents,
the peaks due to 003 and 006 diffraction planes corresponding to nitrate
ions disappeared and new peaks appeared at 2θ positions 3.9
and 7.9° with the d-spacings 2.22 and 1.11 nm,
respectively. The increase in d-spacing from 0.82
nm (before adsorption) to 2.22 nm (after adsorption) indicates intercalation
of AO-II ions within the LDH’s galleries of both PLDH and LDH/PEG-15.
The XRD results are in agreement with those reported for the adsorption
of AO-II on LDHs.27,39

The FTIR spectra of the
PLDH and LDH/PEG-15 taken before and after
adsorption of AO-II are presented in Figure 8b. The intense and broad absorption band
between 3700 and 3000 cm–1, in the spectra of all
the samples is due to the stretching vibrations of the hydrogen-bonded
hydroxyl groups in the metal hydroxide sheets. The antisymmetric stretching
vibration of the nitrate ions intercalated in the interlayer space
of the adsorbents is shown by the sharp peak between 1380 and 1330
cm–1. The absorption band at 1368 cm–1 also accounts for the stretching vibration of carbonate ions present
in small amounts.40 The medium sharp peak
at 1598 cm–1 is due to the O–H bending vibration
of the interlayer water molecules.41 The
LDH/PEG-15 shows three additional peaks at 1052, 1203, and 2867 cm–1 which are characteristic peaks for bending vibration
of the C–O–H group and symmetric stretching vibration
of the C–H group due to the PEG.42 The FTIR spectra of the AO-II-loaded PLDH and LDH/PEG-15 are alike
which indicates that the AO-II uptake mechanisms of these two adsorbents
are the same. The inset of Figure 8b shows characteristic absorption bands of AO-II at
1626 (or 1630) cm–1 and 1514 (or 1506) cm–1 for the aromatic C=C and azo group (−N=N−),
respectively.43 The absorption bands due
to the coupling between the benzene mode and SO3– group can be seen at 1126 (or 1134) cm–1 and 1040
(or 1042) cm–1.43 Intercalation
of AO-II in the interlayer space of the adsorbents does not significantly
affect the characteristic vibration bands of AO-II. This observation
confirms that the present dye uptake process is purely a physical
adsorption.

The particle size distribution of PLDH in aqueous
medium studied
by the dynamic light scattering experiment shows polydispersity of
the LDH and the z-average diameter is 216.8 nm (Figure S6). The same experiment with LDH/PEG-15
and LDH/PEG-50 shows a very different nature of dispersity of the
two adsorbents. While LDH/PEG-15 shows better dispersity than the
PLDH with the z-average diameter being 160.8 nm (Figure S7), which is close to the average diameter
obtained from SEM study, the dispersity of LDH/PEG-50 is low with
the z-average diameter being 218.8 nm (Figure S8). This result implies that treatment
of LDH with the high concentration of PEG has a detrimental effect
on its dispersity. In other words, the agglomeration of the LDH particles
is reduced on treatment with a specific range of concentration of
PEG400, which in turn increased the adsorption capacity
by increasing the available active sites of the adsorbent to the adsorbate.
A schematic of the plausible AO-II uptake mechanism of the LDH/PEG-15
is presented in Scheme 1. A review of literature reports, unlike the high-molecular weight
PEGs, the low-molecular weight PEGs do not react with the LDH but
act as a dispersing agent and reduce aggregation of LDH particles
in aqueous medium.44 Therefore, the significant
increase in adsorption capacity of the LDH on treatment with PEG400 may be attributed to the better dispersion and/or reduced
agglomeration of the adsorbent particles.

3 Conclusions
In summary, Mg/Al/NO3 LDHs were synthesized and modified
with PEG400. The influence of PEG on physicochemical characteristics
and adsorption properties of the LDH/PEG adsorbents was studied. Both
the pristine and the PEG-modified LDHs (PLDH and LDH/PEG-15) exhibited
reasonably high surface area, mesoporous nature, and positive zeta
potential values, which are characteristics of good adsorbents. The
AO-II adsorption capacities of the PLDH and the LDH/PEG-15 were 490.2
and 625.0 mg/g, respectively. AO-II adsorption capacity of the PLDH
increased by about 30% on treatment with PEG400. Compared
to many reported adsorbents, the LDH/PEG adsorbents exhibited remarkable
high adsorption capacity and adsorption rate for the anionic dye AO-II.
The thermodynamics parameters like ΔH, ΔG, and ΔS indicated endothermic,
physical, spontaneous and feasibility of the present adsorbent–adsorbate
system. The pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the Langmuir isotherm
models are most suitable to explain the experimental adsorption data.
The AO-II uptake by the adsorbents was primarily via electrostatic
interactions between the positively charged metal hydroxide layers
and the anionic chromophores of AO-II, and the intercalation of the
AO-II into the interlayer space between the metal hydroxide layers.
However, the enhanced adsorption capacity of the PEG-modified LDH
is mainly due to the better dispersity of the LDH/PEG as compared
to the PLDH. Owing to the high adsorption capacity of the LDH/PEGs
and nontoxic nature of both LDH and PEG400, they can be
potential adsorbent for water/wastewater treatment.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Reagents
Magnesium
nitrate hexahydrate,
aluminium nitrate nonahydrate, and PEG400 were procured
from MERCK Chemicals. Sodium hydroxide pellets (AR grade) were purchased
from Himedia laboratories. AO-II Sodium Salt (C.I. no. 15510, molecular
weight 350.32, λmax 483 nm) was procured from Sigma-Aldrich.
Double distilled water was used for all the experiments and for the
preparation of standard solutions.

4.2 Synthesis
of the Adsorbents
4.2.1 Synthesis of Mg/Al LDH
The Mg/Al
LDH was prepared via the co-precipitation method, and the detailed
process is described in our previous publication.45 A solution containing the mixture of magnesium and aluminium
nitrates (Mg/Al molar ratio 2) was co-precipitated in an aqueous medium
using 2 M NaOH solution at 60 °C and at a pH of 10 ± 0.5.
The precipitate thus formed was aged for 16 h in the reaction mixture
under continuous stirring after which the precipitate was separated
by centrifugation. The solid mass thus obtained was washed thoroughly
with distilled water to remove any excess alkali and dried at 60 °C
in an air oven and powdered. The solid thus obtained is hereafter
denoted as PLDH.

4.2.2 Synthesis of the PEG
Modified LDH (LDH/PEG)
Adsorbents
The PEG-modified LDHs were synthesized by a slightly
modified method as described by Gunister et al. in 2013 for the synthesis
of the poly (diallyldimethylammoniumchloride)/sodium-montmorillonite
composite.46 A fixed amount of the PLDH
was reacted with an aqueous solution of PEG400 at 50 °C
for 4 h. The LDH/PEG thus formed was separated from the solution by
centrifugation, dried at 50 °C in an air oven, and powdered.
A series of LDH/PEG adsorbents were prepared by varying the concentration
of the PEG400 solution between 0 and 50% (w/v). The LDH/PEG
adsorbents thus prepared by using 5, 15, 25, and 50% aqueous solution
of PEG400 were named as LDH/PEG-5, LDH/PEG-15, LDH/PEG-25,
and LDH/PEG-50, respectively.

4.3 Characterization
Techniques
The synthesized
PLDH and the LDH/PEG adsorbents were characterized for their chemical
composition and physical behavior using different techniques. The
XRD patterns of the adsorbents were recorded by X’Pert-PRO
XRD from PANalytical Instruments using Cu Kα radiation. The
FTIR spectra of the adsorbents were recorded in a Cary 600 FTIR spectrometer
(Agilent Technologies Pvt. Ltd, USA) by the KBr pellet method. The
thermal analyses were performed by a thermogravimetric analyzer (model
Q50 from TA Instruments, Austria) in the temperature range from room
temperature to 800 °C with a ramping rate of 20 °C/min.
The surface morphologies of the adsorbents were studied using SEM
(FEI Quanta 200 SEM). The concentrations of magnesium and aluminium
in the adsorbents were determined using inductively coupled plasma–optical
emission spectroscopy (model: Prodigy, Teledyne Leeman Labs, USA).
The C, H, and N present in the adsorbents were analyzed using the
CHNS analyzer (Elementar Vario Micro Superuser, Germany). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
surface area and porosity of the adsorbents were measured by the nitrogen
adsorption–desorption technique at 77 K using a surface area
analyzer (model: Autosorb 1, Quantachrome Instruments, USA). The zeta
potential (ζ) and particle size distribution of the adsorbents
were measured by the dynamic light scattering technique after dispersing
the adsorbent particles in water (Zetasizer Nano ZS, Malvern Instruments).

4.4 Adsorption Experiments
The adsorption
experiments were carried out in batches under isothermal conditions
(30 °C) in a thermostatic shaking water bath (Julabo SW23). Aqueous
solution (100 mL) of AO-II of the known concentration taken in a 250
mL stoppered glass conical flask was contacted with a fixed amount
of the adsorbent for a definite time period in the thermostatic shaking
water bath. Thereafter, the solution was filtered and the residual
dye concentration in the filtrate was determined spectrophotometrically
(Cary 100 UV–Visible spectrophotometer, Agilent Technologies,
USA) at 483 nm wavelength. The adsorption capacity was calculated
using the formula 7  

The percentage
adsorption was calculated
using the formula 8  where qe is the
amount of dye (AO-II) adsorbed per unit gram of the adsorbent at equilibrium, C0 is the initial AO-II concentration, Ce is the equilibrium AO-II concentration (mg/L), v is the volume of AO-II solution in liter, and w is the weight of the adsorbent in grams.

On the
basis of the adsorbent dose variation experiment presented
in Figure S9, the adsorbent dose was kept
at 0.5 g/L (84.9% adsorption) in all the batch adsorption experiments,
so that the influence of various parameters (incremental or detrimental)
can be detected. Except the adsorption isotherm experiments, all other
adsorption studies were performed on an initial AO-II concentration
of 200 mg/L.

Adsorption kinetics was studied for a time period
of 0–6
h with an initial AO-II concentration of 100 and 200 mg/L. Sample
solutions were withdrawn at fixed time intervals and measured for
residual AO-II concentrations.

The adsorption isotherm experiments
were performed at three different
temperatures, 30, 40 and 50 °C, and the initial AO-II concentration
was varied between 200 and 800 mg/L and the contact time was 2 h.

The desorption study was carried out using AO-II saturated LDH/PEG-15
for which 0.05 g of LDH/PEG-15 was contacted with 100 mL of 200 mg/L
AO-II solution for 24 h. The AO-II saturated LDH/PEG-15 was separated
and dried at 65 °C. The AO-II/LDH/PEG-15 thus obtained was then
contacted with 100 mL water and the concentration of desorbed AO-II
in the solution was determined as a function of time. The percentage
desorption was calculated with respect to the amount of AO-II loaded
on the adsorbent. The same procedure was followed for desorption studies
in 0.05 M NaOH solution.

To regenerate the used adsorbent, the
AO-II loaded adsorbent was
calcined at 480 °C for 1 h, cooled, and then treated with 15%
aqueous solution of PEG400 for 4 h at 50 °C. Afterward,
the adsorbent was separated by centrifugation and dried at 50 °C
in an air oven.

To study the influence of pH on the AO-II uptake
by the LDH/PEG
composites, the initial pH values of the AO-II solutions were adjusted
using dilute HCl/NaOH.

All the experiments were repeated three
times, and the average
values are reported.
