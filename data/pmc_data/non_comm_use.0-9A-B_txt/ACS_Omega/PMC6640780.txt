Polydicyclopentadiene (PDCPD) is
a tough, heavily crosslinked thermoset
polymer that has high heat, chemical, and impact resistance coupled
with a low density. Current limitations to the broader industrial
application of PDCPD include its low surface energy and lack of chemical
tunability. Here, we report the first example of a polymer derived
from a carboxyl-functionalized dicyclopentadiene monomer and its subsequent
thermal crosslinking. The resulting material has the highest glass-transition
temperature reported for a polydicyclopentadiene and allows for the
facile manipulation of the surface chemistry through alteration of
the embedded functional group. We also report the first observation
by differential scanning calorimetry of the crosslinking step as a
discreet thermal event.

Introduction
Polydicyclopentadiene
(PDCPD, Scheme 1A)
is an industrially important material
that is produced via ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP)
from an abundant dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) monomer feedstock.1,2 The resulting polymer is extensively crosslinked when made under
typical manufacturing conditions, which results in a very high impact
resistance, coupled with a good resistance to chemical corrosion and
a high heat deflection temperature. These properties make PDCPD attractive
for use in the automotive industry. Initially used to make cowlings
for snowmobiles (due to its high impact resistance at low temperatures),
PDCPD is now used to make body panels, bumpers, and other components
for trucks, buses, tractors, and construction equipment.3,4 Other prospective applications include the creation of porous materials
for tissue engineering or gas storage applications5 as well as microencapsulated dicyclopentadiene for use
in self-healing polymers.6 The polymerization
of DCPD can be accomplished using a number of different transition
metal catalysts (e.g., Ru, Mo, W, Ti)1,2 and has recently
been reported under metal-free conditions via photoredox catalysis.7 The exact structure of the resulting material
depends to some extent on the precise reaction conditions used for
the polymerization. Whereas the crosslinked polymer is typically suggested
to have arisen from metathesis of both alkenes in the parent monomer
(to give the structure shown in gray in Scheme 1A),2,8 Wagener showed that
this is often not representative of the true structure of the crosslink.
Instead, for many polymerization conditions at least, it is more likely
that only the strained norbornene ring in the monomer undergoes olefin
metathesis under the conditions of the reaction. Subsequent crosslinking
steps result from thermal (probably radical) condensation of the remaining
olefins in the linear polymer.9,1b

Controllable Thermal Crosslinking
Despite the numerous advantages outlined above, polydicyclopentadiene
has several disadvantages that have limited its broader application
as an industrial material. Many of these originate from the lack of
chemical functionality present on the polymer. For example, PDCPD
has a low surface energy when freshly prepared; this can make it difficult
to paint PDCPD parts or to attach them to other objects without a
time- and space-intensive ageing step to oxidize the surface.10 Also, the polymer is not chemically tunable
since the parent monomer (itself a homodimer of cyclopentadiene) cannot
be easily functionalized without disrupting its ability to participate
in the metathesis reaction. Thus, whereas polymers of functionalized
ethylene (e.g., propylene, styrene, acrylic acid, methyl acrylate,
acrylonitrile, methyl methacrylate, etc.) exhibit a broad range of
very distinct and very useful material properties, no such variability
can be readily obtained for DCPD-based homopolymers. Finally, PDCPD
often inherits an acrid, camphor-like odor from its monomer DCPD,
limiting its indoor utilization.

Each of these issues could
presumably be solved by bringing functionality
to PDCPD. The resulting functionalized polydicyclopentadiene
(fPDCPD) will naturally have a higher surface energy
(owing to the presence of a functional group), tunable properties
(since the functional group could be modified), and a reduced odor
(owing to a higher molecular weight for the monomer). Indeed, many
groups have developed postpolymerization strategies
to functionalize the residual double bonds in PDCPD by bromination,11 epoxidation,12 inverse-demand
Diels–Alder,13 radical-initiated
thiol–ene addition,14 etc. However,
to the best of our knowledge, there are only two publications describing
the polymerization of a prefunctionalized DCPD monomer
(Scheme 1B).15,16 Both reports (by Xu in 201515 and Lemcoff
in 201616) took advantage of a known SeO2-mediated allylic oxidation on DCPD,17 followed by further esterification or etherification and Ru-catalyzed
ROMP to achieve a new family of odorless fPDCPD polymers.
These novel fPDCPDs mostly possessed glass-transition
temperatures (Tg) ranging from 80 to 143
°C,16,18 which is between those of linear PDCPD (Tg ∼ 53 °C)19 and crosslinked PDCPD (Tg ∼ 155–165
°C).3a,20 The glass-transition temperature is closely
related to the maximum service temperature for PDCPD.21 It has a significant correlation with both the thermal
properties of the polymer and the physicochemical and mechanical properties
(such as molecular weight, degree of crosslinking and crystallinity,
and shear modulus).22 The relatively low Tg values for the fPDCPDs summarized
in Scheme 1B (most
of which were <100 °C) may suggest a low degree of crosslinking
relative to the parent material; indeed, the 1-hydroxydicylopentadiene-derived
polymers were originally designed to disfavor crosslinking.15 In addition, both reports described substantial
mass losses occurring at temperatures above ∼220 °C,15,16 presumably owing to loss of the allylic acetate or ether leaving
groups. Thus, while existing fPDCPDs have interesting
properties that may be useful in certain applications, the low Tg values and poor thermal stability may undercut
their industrial utility.

Results and Discussion
Rather than
functionalizing DCPD through allylic oxidation (which
seems to lower the Tg of the resulting
polymer while also reducing its thermal stability), we envisioned
that it would be more beneficial to install a C-linked ester on the
unstrained olefin of dicyclopentadiene (Scheme 1C). We hypothesized that this strategic change
to the chemical structure of the monomer would engender several desirable
properties in the resulting polymeric material:(1) Esters typically have pleasant fruity
odors,23 which should limit any concern
about residual monomer in the final material.

(2) Unlike the allylically disposed acetates
and ethers used previously (Scheme 1B), the C-linked ester cannot function as a leaving
group. As a result, our polymers should have a thermal stability closer
to that of the parent PDCPD.

(3) Addition of an extra functional group
(particularly an electron-withdrawing group) to the unstrained olefin
in DCPD should completely block olefin metathesis from happening at
this site (at least for modest reaction temperatures).28b This should limit any confusion about the mechanism
of the crosslinking step since thermal curing will now be fully decoupled
from metathesis processes.

(4) Indeed, the positioning of an ester
at C2 of DCPD effectively embeds a methyl methacrylate motif into
the chemical framework of the postmetathesis linear polymer. The thermal
polymerization of methyl methacrylate (via self-initiated radical
processes) is well known to afford predominantly a head-to-tail linkage
in the resulting polymer.24 We would expect
our material to behave similarly, generating regiochemically predictable
chemical crosslinks, as shown in Scheme 1C. This is in stark contrast to PDCPD itself,
where presumably all of the residual olefins can react in the thermal
crosslinking step, with little to no regiochemical control.

(5) The result of our predicted
chemical
crosslinking step would position the ester group at a quaternary center.
This increased steric hindrance to bond rotation should result in
an increased Tg.25

(6) The identity of the
ester group could
be changed (either before or after polymerization), providing for
the facile tuning of properties in the final polymer material.



With these advantages in mind, we targeted
compound 4 (Scheme 2) as our
monomer of choice. The heterodimerization of carboxylated cyclopentadiene
and unmodified cyclopentadiene to give a mixture of regioisomers 3 and 4 is well known.26 Building upon these earlier reports and taking advantage of our
recently reported cyclopentadienylide salt-based route to ester-containing
derivatives of dicyclopentadiene,27 we
were able to achieve the synthesis of 3 and 4 (in a ∼1.5:1 ratio) in 60% yield. The reaction behaved consistently
upon scale-up and was easily increased to 45 g scale. In contrast
to unmodified DCPD, the mixture of 3 and 4 has an agreeable fruity smell.

Scheme 2 Synthesis of the Ester-Containing
Monomer
At first glance, the
formation of a mixture of regioisomers (which
are difficult to separate on preparative scale) might seem to be problematic.
But we hypothesized that of the four olefins in 3 and 4, only one alkene, the strained norbornene-type olefin in 4, would be a good substrate for olefin metathesis using a
ruthenium-based catalyst. The other three alkenes are either unstrained
or else bear an additional electron-withdrawing group, making them
less likely to react with the catalyst.28 This was quickly proven by treating a mixture of 3 and 4 with the Grubbs second-generation catalyst at room temperature
(Figure 1). As expected,
compound 4 underwent selective polymerization to afford
the desired linear polymer 5. Polymer formation was indicated
by broadening of the NMR signals (particularly for the downfield signal
corresponding to the electron-deficient alkene C–H) and an
upfield shift for the protons on the unfunctionalized olefin (corresponding
to the formation of a less-strained alkene). Compound 3 was completely unreactive under the conditions employed. Indeed,
even when the reaction was repeated at higher temperatures (refluxing
benzene or toluene), we observed no polymer arising from monomer 3.

Figure 1 Selective polymerization of monomer 4. (A) Initial
monomer mixture. (B) Crude mixture of polymer product and unreacted
monomer following selective polymerization. (C) Polymer product isolated
by precipitation from ether. (D) Recovered unreacted monomer from
the supernatant.

After quenching the catalyst
with ethyl vinyl ether, the two products
were separated by the addition of diethyl ether to precipitate the
polymer. Centrifugation provided pure polymer 5 (Figure 1C) and left behind
a supernatant that contained only unreacted 3 (Figure 1D). The cracking
of ester-functionalized dicyclopentadienes like 3 has
already been reported by Franklin, which means that the unwanted monomer
can be recycled back to the original mixture of 3 and 4 with heating.29

The molecular
weight of 5 was estimated at ∼45 000
g/mol by comparing the 1H NMR integration of the phenyl
end-group and the internal vinyl protons. 1H and 13C NMR data, together with the high solubility of the freshly prepared
polymer, indicated the absence of any appreciable degree of crosslinking.
However, like all polydicyclopentadienes14,30 compound 5 was somewhat air-sensitive and underwent
slow oxidation upon exposure to atmospheric conditions. This resulted
in a growth of molecular weight (presumably owing to chemical crosslinking
initiated by molecular oxygen) that we were able to monitor by dynamic
light scattering (DLS; Figure 2). Similar trends were observed for three separate preparations
of polymer. Oxidative crosslinking was further supported by the determination
from gel permeation chromatography (GPC) of increasing molecular weights
following sample storage (up to ∼30 000 000 Da
for a 2-day-old sample; see Figure S1 in
the Supporting Information for details) as well as by the observation
that after 2–3 days the samples became distinctly less soluble
(see Figure S2).

Figure 2 Oxidative crosslinking
leads to a slow growth in effective hydrodynamic
radii.

Compound 5 was thermally
cured at 180 °C to afford
a hard, completely insoluble material (6), for which
we tentatively assign the structure shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Thermal Curing of fPDCPD. The
red asterisk indicates
the measured glass-transition temperature for the crosslinked polymer.

The glass-transition temperature
for crosslinked polymer 6 was reproducibly measured to
be 200 °C (inset to Figure 3). To the best of
our knowledge, this is the highest Tg ever
reported for an unaged20 polydicyclopentadiene
and is consistent with our hypothesis that the increased steric hindrance
(and therefore reduced rotational freedom) that arises from our strategic
positioning of the carboxyl substituent on the alkene that participates
in the crosslinking step will serve to increase the Tg.

Since the crosslinking reaction evidently occurred
at a temperature
that was below the Tg, we wondered whether
we might be able to observe the crosslinking event directly by differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC). To this end, freshly prepared linear polymer
(5) was dried under vacuum and transferred directly to
the DSC under a nitrogen atmosphere. Upon heating, we observed a distinct
endothermic event at ∼140 °C, prior to the usual glass
transition at 200 °C (Figure 4A). After reaching a final temperature of 300 °C,
the sample was cooled to room temperature and then immediately rerun.
In the second analysis (of the now-crosslinked polymer, 6), the 140 °C endothermic event was not observed, but a sharp
glass transition occurred at the same temperature as before. These
data allowed us to assign the 140 °C transition as the crosslinking
step and also demonstrate that the crosslinks in 6 are
not thermally reversible.

Figure 4 TGA/DSC analysis from linear polymer 5, showing in
situ crosslinking to 6 and good thermal stability. (A)
DSC data used to observe crosslinking and glass-transition temperature.
(B) TGA used to evaluate thermal stability.

At the same time that we were monitoring the DSC data, we
also
measured the percent mass loss by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA).
As shown in Figure 4B, we saw only a small mass loss during our first run (mostly below
100 °C), which we attribute to removal of residual solvent under
the experimental conditions. Other than this, the polymer appears
to be extremely stable up to 300 °C. This observation is consistent
with our earlier hypothesis that positioning the functional group
at the C2 position of the dicyclopentadiene monomer (rather than at
C1, as other groups have done) limits the chemistry available to the
system, thereby improving the thermal stability.

Having thus
addressed the thermal properties for 5 and 6, we next focused on the controllable modification
of the surface chemistry. To accomplish this, we spin-coated the linear
polymer 5 onto a series of glass slides and then incubated
each slide in a 180 °C oven to facilitate crosslinking. The slides
were then suspended in a solution of methanolic sodium hydroxide,
followed by a solution of aqueous HCl.

For each slide, we first
measured the mean surface roughness (Ra) by atomic force microscopy (AFM) to establish
that our hydrolysis protocol had not caused substantial pitting or
otherwise introduced surface defects that would invalidate our subsequent
contact angle measurements. These data (Figure 5C) confirmed that each of our samples was
smoother than the unmodified glass slide used as a control. With the
sample quality thereby established, we proceeded to measure surface
energy through a two-solvent contact angle protocol.31

Figure 5 Hydrolysis of fPDCPD 6 and representative
water contact angle measurements. (A) Saponification/acidification
protocol used to alter surface energy. (B) Representative contact
angle measurements for each sample. (C) Surface roughnesses determined
for each sample, as well as a control.

As shown in Figure 5B, we found a marked difference in the water contact angle
of the
original methyl-ester-containing polymer (6) compared
to that of the (partially) hydrolyzed carboxylate, 7,
and free acid, 8. Water contact angles ranged from nearly
90° for the unmodified polymer (compared with 120° for an
authentic sample of the parent PDCPD32)
down to ∼30° for the carboxylic acid. The fact that the
contact angle continued to change with additional operations suggests
that only partial hydrolysis was effected
at each stage of the protocol. This is unsurprising given that many
of the ester groups in the polymer will not be surface-accessible.

Together with an equivalent set of contact angles measured with
diiodomethane (see Table S1 in the Supplementary
Information for a summary of all individual contact angle measurements),
these data allowed us to calculate the dispersion surface tension
(γsvd),
polar surface tension (γsvp), and overall surface tension using the Owens,
Wendt, Rabel, and Kaelble (OWRK) equations31 (Table 1).

Table 1 Summary of Surface Tension Measurements

6	H2O: 87.2 ± 0.9	36.6 ± 0.5	1.9 ± 0.1	38.5 ± 0.6

CH2I2: 52.2 ± 1.4	
Gratifyingly, we observed a clear increase of γsvp and decrease
of γsvd with increasing ester hydrolysis. More importantly, the overall
γsv values were enhanced from 38.5 mN/m (for the
methyl ester) to 66.6 mN/m (for the carboxylic acid). This is a much
greater range of surface energies than is available to unfunctionalized
PDCPD, which has a γsv value of 36–38 mN/m when freshly made,10 increasing to 48–52 mN/m following oxidation.10,33 Indeed, to the best of our knowledge, polymers 6–8 represent the largest (and therefore most tunable) range
of surface energies known for any polydicyclopentadiene-based homopolymer.34

To illustrate the dramatic change in hydrophobicity
between 6 and 7/8 on a macroscopic
scale,
we used a Pasteur pipette to add droplets of water (containing a colored
dye to aid visibility) to the surface of a glass slide that had been
coated with polymer 6 by the spin-coating/crosslinking
method described above and then half-immersed in a solution of methanolic
NaOH (see Figure S3 in the Supporting Information
for a picture of the experimental setup).

We observed the water
droplets to rapidly shift from the hydrophobic
side of the sample (coated with unmodified 6) toward
the hydrolyzed (and therefore hydrophilic) side of the slide (refer
to the Supporting Information for a video
of this process). Eventually, all of the water accumulated on the
portion of the sample that had been exposed to saponification conditions,
as shown in Figure 6. This exceptional distinction between hydrophilic and hydrophobic
regions of a single spin-coated sample may open the door toward the
use of fPDCPD in microfluidic applications.

observation of changes in surface hydrophobicity following
ester hydrolysis.

Conclusions
In
summary, we have achieved the first high-Tg functionalized polydicyclopentadiene polymer with good thermal
stability, controllable surface energy, and no unpleasant odor. The
thermal crosslinking process was observed directly by DSC and shown
to be irreversible under the conditions employed. In future work,
we plan to study the mechanical properties of our novel fPDCPDs in greater detail and to exploit their inherent functionality
to create a chemically recyclable thermoset.

Experimental Section
General
Experimental Methods
Liquid reagents were transferred
via glass microsyringe. Solvents were transferred via syringe with
a stainless steel needle. Organic solutions were concentrated at 40
°C by rotary evaporation under vacuum. Analytical thin-layer
chromatography (TLC) was performed using aluminum plates precoated
with silica gel (0.20 mm, 60 Å pore size, 230–400 mesh,
Macherey-Nagel) impregnated with a fluorescent indicator (254 nm).
TLC plates were visualized by exposure to ultraviolet light. Flash-column
chromatography was performed over SiliaFlash F60 (40–63 μm).
Centrifugation was performed by Beckman Coulter Allegra X-12R benchtop
centrifuge.

Commercial solvents and reagents were used as received
with the following exceptions. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was dried by
distillation over sodium and benzophenone. Dichloromethane was dried
by passage through alumina in a commercial solvent purification system.

Proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectra (1H NMR) were
recorded at 300 or 500 MHz at ambient temperature. Proton chemical
shifts are expressed in parts per million (ppm, δ scale) downfield
from tetramethylsilane and are referenced to residual protium in the
NMR solvent (CDCl3, δ 7.26; CD2Cl2, δ 5.32). Carbon NMR spectra (13C NMR) were
recorded at 75 or 125 MHz at ambient temperature. Carbon chemical
shifts are reported in ppm downfield from tetramethylsilane and are
referenced to the carbon resonances of the solvent (CDCl3, δ 77.16; CD2Cl2, δ 53.84). Infrared
(IR) spectra were obtained using a Fourier transform IR spectrometer
referenced to a polystyrene standard. Accurate masses were obtained
using an orbitrap mass spectrometer. Gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry (GC–MS) data was collected using a Clarus 680
GC coupled to an AxIon iQT MS with cold-EI ionization.

Contact
angles were obtained with a Holmarc contact angle meter
(HO-IAD-CAM-01). The polar liquid was deionized water. The dispersive
liquid was diiodomethane. DSC and TGA measurements were conducted
on a TA Instruments Q600 SDT simultaneous thermal analyzer with samples
being placed in an aluminum oxide crucible, referenced against an
empty aluminum oxide crucible. Data was collected with a ramp rate
of 5 °C/min following temperature equalization at 50 °C
under a nitrogen atmosphere flowing at 100 mL/min. For spin casting
of polymer films, a Best Tools, LLC model SC110-B Spin Coater was
used. AFM measurements of the glass coverslips were performed on an
Agilent Technologies 5500 Scanning Probe Microscope equipped with
a Ted Pella TAP190-G AFM probe operating in tapping mode.

GPC
measurements were performed using a Viscotek Model 302 liquid
chromatography system (Viscotek GPCmax + TDA 302 triple detector array)
equipped with refractive index (RI), low-angle light scattering (θ
= 7°), and right-angle light scattering (θ = 90°)
detection. THF was used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 mL/min,
and the column temperature was set at 35 °C. All polymer solutions
were filtered through membrane filters with a nominal pore size of
0.45 μm prior to injection into the GPC columns. The data was
collected and analyzed using appropriate GPC software from Viscotek.
The system was installed with a Tosoh Biosciences, LLC TSKgel HHR
series guard and two separation columns in series; specifically, HHR-H
guard column and G3000HHR and GMHHR-M columns, respectively. Molecular
weights were calculated from GPC data using an algorithm from Viscotek.

DLS measurements were collected on a Brookhaven Instruments BI-200SM
goniometer equipped with a BI-9000AT digital autocorrelator and a
Brookhaven Instruments Mini-L30 compact diode laser (637 nm) with
a 30 mW output. Samples were diluted with filtered THF into thoroughly
washed glass cells. Measurements were carried out in cylindrical glass
cells, thereby simplifying corrections of variations in RI. Cells
were immersed in a vat of decalin to minimize light refraction. Triplicate
measurements collected at 90° were analyzed through the use of
a second order cumulant expansion, which provides the hydrodynamic
radius (Rg) calculated from the translational
diffusion coefficient.35

Synthesis of
Monomer Mixture (i.e., 3 and 4)
A flame-dried round-bottom flask fitted with an
oven-dried condenser was charged with 7 mL sodium cyclopentadienylide
solution (2 M in THF, 14 mmol). To this solution was added 5.9 mL
dimethylcarbonate (70 mmol) at room temperature with stirring. The
reaction mixture was heated to reflux for 6 h and then cooled to room
temperature. The mixture was concentrated in vacuo. To the resulting
solid was added iPrOH (to 0.33 M), 0.41 mL sulfuric
acid (0.55 equiv, 7.7 mmol), and 2.35 mL of freshly cracked cyclopentadiene
(28 mmol) at room temperature with stirring. Acidification was marked
by a brown to orange color change. The solution was heated to 50 °C
overnight. The reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo, and the
resulting oil was dissolved in toluene and loaded onto a silica gel
column. Elution with hexanes–ethyl acetate provided 1.60 g

Synthesis of Polymer 5
To a mixture of 3 and 4 (190 mg, 1 mmol) in 3 mL of DCM was added
8 mg Grubbs second-generation catalyst (monomer/catalyst = 40:1).
The mixture was allowed to stir at room temperature for 40 min. To
this solution was added 1 mL ethyl vinyl ether. The reaction was stirred
for an additional 1 h, after which 10 mL of diethyl ether was added.
White precipitate indicated formation of the polymer. The resulting
mixture was centrifuged at 3000 rpm and 4 °C for 5 min. Polymer 5 was isolated as a precipitate (64 mg, 90% based upon the
amount of 4 in the starting mixture), and unreacted 3 was obtained in the ether supernatant. 1H NMR

Thermal Crosslinking
An oven-dried vial was charged
with polymer 5 under an argon atmosphere. The reaction
was heated to 180 °C overnight. A tough, insoluble material 6 was obtained. Refer to Figure 3 for DSC characterization data.

Spin Casting
and Functionalization of Polymers
Spin
casting was performed on freshly cleaned, 18 × 18 mm2 glass coverslips. Cleaning was performed as follows: 10 min of sonication
in chloroform and 10 min in methanol followed by overnight drying
under vacuum. Polymer samples were dissolved to 4 wt % in CH2Cl2 and a 50 μL droplet was dropped onto a coverslip
spinning at 2000 rpm. Following deposition, the film was allowed to
spin for 60 s to ensure that the majority of solvent had been removed.

Linear polymer 5 was spin-coated on precleaned glass
slides. These coated glass slides were kept in a 180 °C oven
under vacuum overnight to give crosslinked polymer 6.
These polymer-6-coated slides were immersed in a solution
of methanolic NaOH (1:1 MeOH/10% aqueous NaOH) under vacuum. After
8 h, the slides were washed with water and MeOH and then dried in
a 70 °C oven under vacuum overnight. The resulting polymer-7-coated slides were acidified with 10% HCl solution under
vacuum for 30 min. All the slides were then washed with water and
MeOH and dried in a 70 °C oven under vacuum overnight to give
polymer-8-coated slides.

Slides half-coated with
polymer 6 and half with polymer 7 were prepared
by suspending half of each polymer-6-coated slide in
a solution of methanolic NaOH (1:1 MeOH/10% aqueous
NaOH) for 8 h under argon (see Figure S3). The resulting slides were washed with water and MeOH and then
dried at 70 °C oven under vacuum overnight.

AFM Measurements
AFM measurements of the coated glass
coverslips were performed on an Agilent Technologies 5500 Scanning
Probe Microscope equipped with a Ted Pella TAP190-G AFM probe operating
in tapping mode. To minimize vibrations, the microscope was covered
in a vibration-resistant case on a vibration isolation platform maintained
at 80 psi. Each sample was imaged at three separate locations on the
slide, surface roughness measurements being collected over a 10 μm
× 10 μm area. Data was analyzed with the use of the Gwyddion
data analysis software package. All images underwent slight modification
to remove experimental artifacts such as sloped background, contrast
alteration for ease of viewing (this was performed after measurements),
and in some cases performing Fourier filtering of an unknown 10 Hz
noise.

Contact Angle Measurements
A drop of liquid (2 μL)
was deposited on the freshly prepared substrate using a Hamilton microsyringe
with a mechanical dispenser. Side-view images of the drop on the substrate
were taken by a high-performance aberration-corrected imaging lens
with precise manual focus adjustment (CMOS sensor). Advancing contact
angles were measured on these images. Two glass chips were prepared
for each substrate. Three drops of liquid were deposited at three
different regions of each film. A mean contact angle and standard
deviation were thus determined from the resulting measurements. A
sample of conventional PDCPD was obtained from Product Rescue BVBA,
Waarschoot, Belgium. Prior to analysis, the sample was polished with
400 grit sandpaper, then washed with water and MeOH, and dried at
70 °C in a vacuum oven overnight.

Surface tensions were
calculated by the combination of the OWRK equations (eqs 1 and 2). 1   2  H2O γlv = 72.8
mN/m, H2O γlvd = 21.8 mN/m, H2O γlvp = 50.0 mN/m.
CH2I2 γlv = 50.8 mN/m, CH2I2 γlvd = 50.8 mN/m, CH2I2 γlvp = 00.0 mN/m.
θ = contact angle

Xu reported a relatively
high Tg (136–159 °C) for linear acetoxy-functionalized PDCPD (see ref (15)); this is higher than
most of the Tg values that Lemcoff reported
for the crosslinked materials
(see ref (16)) and
may reflect a difference in the measurement protocol or possibly even
crosslinking under the conditions of the Tg measurement. In any event, Xu’s polymer experienced a substantial
loss of mass at temperatures above 221 °C, which brings up similar
questions regarding its thermal stability.
