Dynamic assessment of glycan expression
on the cell surface and
accurate determination of circulating tumor cells are increasingly
imperative for cancer diagnosis and therapeutics. Herein, a unique
and versatile nonenzymatic sandwich-structured electrochemical cytosensor
was developed. The cytosensor was constructed based on a cell-specific
aptamer, the lectin-functionalized porous core–shell palladium
gold nanoparticles (Pd@Au NPs). To establish the cytosensor, amine-modified-SYL3C
aptamer was first attached to the surface of aminated Fe3O4@SiO2 nanoparticles (Fe3O4@SiO2–NH2 NPs) through cross-linked
reaction via glutaraldehyde. Besides, in terms of noncovalent assembly
of concanavalin A on Pd@Au NPs, a lectin-functionalized nanoprobe
was established. This nanoprobe had the capabilities of both the specific
carbohydrate recognition and the current signal amplification in view
of the Pd@Au NPs as the electrocatalyst for the reduction of hydrogen
peroxide (H2O2). Herein, we used MCF-7 cells
as a model target, and the constructed cytosensor showed a low detection
limit (down to three cells), a wide linear detection ranging from
100 to 1 × 106 cells mL–1. The established
method sensitively realized the detection of the amount of cell and
exact evaluation of glycan expression on cell surface, demonstrating
great application prospects.

1 Introduction
Recent
statistics reveals that cancer has turned into one of main
causes of human death.1 As related reports
illustrated, cancer metastasis resulted in most of the cancer-relevant
deaths.2 When cancer cells move into the
peripheral blood or lymphatic system from the original tumor position,
they will turn into the circulating tumor cells (CTCs), being considered
as an important element in cancer growth and metastasis3 as well as becoming biomarkers for early cancer
diagnosis.4 Thus, it is important to detect
the CTCs early toward effective treatment of cancers.5 However, owing to the quantity of CTCs is greatly rare
of the early-stage cancer patients, approximately ranging from 1–10
cells every milliliter, leading to the difficulty for their isolation
and quantitative detection.6,7 To make the detection
of CTCs more sensitive, various developed approaches have been established
containing fluorescence sensing and imaging,8 X-ray radiography,9 PCR,10 flow cytometry,11 and spiral
computed tomography.12 Whereas, a majority
of establishing methods had some drawbacks, including time-consumption,
high-cost in the experimental procedures, and sophisticated instruments.
Therefore, it is significant to set up a sensitive and accurate approach
to detect CTCs in clinical analysis.

All eukaryotic cell surfaces
were covered by plentiful carbohydrates
that are covalently associated with potential lipids and proteins.13 There is no doubt that it is significant for
carbohydrates on the cell surface which are generally considered as
the surface biomarkers to regulate many cellular processes, containing
cell–cell communication, differentiation, and signaling.14 In terms of the cellular condition and status,
it is a dynamic process for the expression of glycan on cell surface.15 The N-linked glycosylation (N-glycan) is involved
in the process to disturb the interactions of a biomolecule; therefore,
they control many important physiological processes, for instance,
the growth of the tumor,16 and dynamic
alters of N-glycans on epidermal growth factor were measured to be
related to the expression of Mgat5 which effects cell activity and
tumor metastasis.17 Upon the processes
of tumorigenesis, differentiation, and brain aging, the abnormal expression
of N-glycan on the cell surface was also observed.18 Hence, it is important for the dynamic analysis of cell
surface N-glycans in the diagnosis and treatment of disease.

Currently, more and more methods have been applied for glycan analysis.19−21 Whereas most of these approaches are inappropriate for glycan determination
of living cells in situ as a result of their destructive procedures
and complicated apparatus even though they comprehensively reveal
elaborated structure information. Recently, electrochemical glycan
biosensors22 on account of lectins, a type
of glycan-specific recognizing proteins,23 have been rapidly used in glycan analysis to partially compensate
the drawbacks with underlying utilizations for easy and dynamic evaluate
of glycans on cell surfaces.

Concanavalin A (Con A) not only
combines with mannose but also
has greater interaction to the part of N-glycans.24 Con A can be bounded with glycoproteins including high
mannose, hybrid, and biantennary compound variety of N-glycans.25 On this basis, N-glycosylated positions of glycoproteins
were further mapped by Con A.26,27 Therefore, based on
the affinity between Con A and the trimannoside motif, the majority
of N-glycans on the cell surface could be monitored and recognized.

Electrochemical biosensors have aroused a widespread concern as
a result of their overwhelming advantages, for example, low detection
limit and cost, simple preparation, and quick detection.28 To increase the high sensitivity of electrochemical
biosensors, many efforts have been made via several signal amplification
approaches.29 Upon them, as a result of
the excellent specificity and efficiency of enzymes, the amplified
approach of enzyme catalysis has drawn considerable interests.30 However, the use and selection of enzymes have
several drawbacks, such as, poor stability, complex immobilization,
and high sensitivity to pH and temperature.31 To circumvent the above limitations, enzyme-free electrochemical
cytosensor based on nanomaterials has recently been developed, which
was as an effective strategy for selective and sensitive analysis.32,33 It was reported that a variety of nanomaterials related to metal
and metal oxide have been applied to set up effective electrochemical
biosensor as electrocatalysts because of its possessed intrinsic peroxidase-like
activity.34 Noble-metal-related nanomaterials,
particularly, Pd, Pt, and Au, have extensive applications owing to
the excellent biocompatibility, outstanding catalytic ability, and
high ratio of surface.35 Lately, core–shell
bimetallic nanocrystals have exhibited excellent catalytic property
over the corresponding monometallic nanomaterials on account of the
synergistic and electronic effect.36 Their
catalytic characteristics are attributed to shape and size, as well
as structure and composition.37 More and
more attention has been drawn on the synthesis of bimetallic nanoparticles
(NPs) upon highly porous/dendritic structures.36 On the basis of their large surface area, the dendritic
nanocrystals are in favor of excellent catalytic property.38 In view of the above theory, core–shell
palladium gold NPs as mimetic peroxidase were synthesized to detect
cancer cells by electrochemical method.

Aptamers as a type of
synthetic oligonucleotides have specific
and high interactions to a series of small molecules, proteins, and
cells.39 Compared with antibodies, aptamers
have considerable characteristics, for instance, low molecular weight,
small size, tunable sequences, and programmable structure. In view
of the above advantages, aptamers have become powerful identification
ligand in medical diagnosis. Lately, functional aptamers have been
employed for targeting a large amount of cancer cells, and aptamer-combined
nanomaterials have been widely applied to improve molecular affinity.40 By taking advantage of the high recognition
and good biocompatibility, functional aptamer composites provided
an outstanding approach to design electrochemical cytosensor in early
medical diagnostics.

Owing to the superior characteristics and
excellent biocompatibility
of nanocrystals, more and more nanomaterials have been employed for
the immobilization and electrochemical analysis of cells.14 Lately, magnetic Fe3O4 NPs have attracted a considerable attention owing to their unique
magnetic feature, high ratio of surface, low toxicity, and simple
preparation.41 Importantly, they can load
more biomolecules.42 However, naked Fe3O4 NPs are unstable in air, easily aggregating,
and absent in the activating group to binding, which limited their
further application in electrochemical biosensor. To overcome the
above drawbacks, Fe3O4 NPs are coated by silica
with a core–shell structure that can not only prevent Fe3O4 NP aggregation but also be functionalized easily
to increase compatibility. On the basis of the above advantageous
properties, Fe3O4@SiO2 nanostructures
can be applied as the nanocarriers to immobilize aptamer in our electrochemical
cytosensor.

Here, we develop a nonenzymatic sandwich-structured
biocompatible
amperometric nanobiosensor for ultrasensitive detection of CTCs and
synchronous dynamical assessment of N-glycan expression on CTCs surface.
The cytosensor was fabricated by taking advantage of Pd@Au NPs acting
as a signal amplification probe and aminated Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs as nanocarriers. In the experiments, MCF-7 cells
were used as model CTCs lines. Scheme 1 illustrated the established process of the amperometric
cytosensor. The cytosensor was fabricated through these steps: first,
amine-functionalized Fe3O4@SiO2 nanostructures
were cross-linked with amine-terminated cell-targeting aptamers, SYL3C–NH2,43 via glutaraldehyde (GA) to
build a biocompatible interface to capture CTCs. The aptamer successfully
immobilizing on the nanocomposite interfaces was confirmed through
UV–vis spectra, zeta (ζ) potential, and confocal fluorescence
image characterizations. Subsequently, bovine serum albumin (BSA)
was applied to block the nonspecific absorption sites. Afterward,
Pd@Au NPs were conjugated with Con A through Au–N bond and
electrostatic interactions, which acted as a glycan recognition unit
as well as signal amplification probe. UV–vis absorption spectra
were measured to manifest the successful conjugation between Pd@Au
NPs and Con A. Finally, the sandwiched cytosensor was established
by incubating Fe3O4@SiO2–NH2/aptamer/BSA with CTCs and Pd@Au-conjugated Con A successively.
As expected, the established biosensor indicated an advantageous selectivity
and sensitivity to assay CTCs. Furthermore, when the external stimuli
of N-glycan inhibitor or released enzyme interfere, the developed
cytosensor could effectively react with the variation of cell-surface
glycans. Although in contrast with untreated cells, negligible change
of the current signal was measured by the O-glycan inhibitor. Therefore,
the above performance suggested the feasibility of assessing N-glycan
expression on cell surface through the prepared electrochemical cytosensor.
Thus, the proposed cytosensor possessed the ability for early diagnosis
of cancer and opened an avenue for understanding the glycan function
physiology of in the cellular events and clinical analysis of glycoprotein
relevant diseases.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of Fe3O4@SiO2 Nanostructures
The
transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) image is depicted in Figure 1A,B, from which the black Fe3O4 was surrounded by light-gray SiO2 shell, demonstrating
the Fe3O4@SiO2 was synthesized successfully.
The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image (Figure 1C) shows a large number of uniform spherical
Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs with smooth surfaces.
It can be seen from Figure 1D that the average size of the composite was estimated to
be 389 nm.

Figure 1 (A,B) TEM and (C) SEM images of Fe3O4@SiO2 nanocomposites (D) particle size distributions of Fe3O4@SiO2 nanocomposites.

The magnetic properties of the as-prepared Fe3O4 and Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs were
explored by a VSM at 294 K. Figure S1 depicts
the typical magnetization curves of Fe3O4 and
Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs with the saturation
magnetization (Ms) at 14 kOe of 59.8 and 49.9 emu g–1, respectively. The 16% decrease could be attributed to increase
the diamagnetic SiO2 shell. Even though the Ms value of
Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs was inferior to Fe3O4, it also had an outstanding magnetic response
and the ability to separate easily from the solution under low magnetic
field. As shown in the inset, upon putting a magnet next to the bottle,
Fe3O4@ SiO2 nanostructures were quickly
attracted to the side of the vial, making the solution clear. Although
the magnet was taken away, Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs could be redispersed in the solution again via ultrasound and
shaking. The above results suggest Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs can be applied in the area of biological separation and
detection.

To confirm the successful amine modification of Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs, Fourier transform infrared
(FT-IR) spectra
of the as-prepared nanocomposites were also measured. As depicted
in Figure S2, in the case of Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs, the symmetric and asymmetric stretching
vibrations of the absorption bands of Si–O–Si in the
silica shell was centered on 795 and 1088 cm–1,
respectively. The bands at 957 and 575 cm–1 were
assigned to the stretching vibrations of Si–OH and the Fe–O,
respectively. After amino modification by APTES, the characteristic
band of the C–H stretching vibration of the propyl group at
2917 and 2849 cm–1 appeared. These results clearly
indicated that amine was successfully modified.

2.2 Characterization of Aptamer-Functionalized
Fe3O4@SiO2 Nanocomposites
The construction of the immobilizing aptamer (Fe3O4@SiO2–NH2/aptamer) was characterized
by UV–vis spectra. It can be seen from Figure 2A that Fe3O4@SiO2–NH2 NPs exhibited no obvious characteristic
absorption peaks in UV–vis region (curve b). However, pure
aptamer appeared at an absorbance peak at 265 nm (curve a). After
incubation of the aptamer with Fe3O4@SiO2–NH2 nanostructures, an obvious absorption
peak appeared at 263 nm. These results demonstrated that aptamers
have been successfully immobilized on the Fe3O4@SiO2–NH2 nanostructures.

Figure 2B depicts
the variations of zeta potential of aptamer coupled with Fe3O4@SiO2–NH2 NPs. The average
zeta potentials of the Fe3O4@SiO2–NH2, aptamer, and Fe3O4@SiO2–NH2/aptamer were measured to be +53.3,
−19.7, and +28.8 mV, respectively. The prepared Fe3O4@SiO2–NH2 microspheres
are positively charged because of the presence of the high amine content
in the shells. Upon the aptamer functionalized on the surface of the
microspheres, the results have shown a decrease in the value of zeta
potential from 53.3 to 28.8 mV. This apparently reveals that Fe3O4@SiO2–NH2/aptamer
conjugation carries less positive charge owing to the attachment of
negatively charged ssDNA strands in comparison with normal Fe3O4@SiO2–NH2 NPs.

Meanwhile, confocal fluorescence image was also obtained to demonstrate
the conjugation of aptamer to Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs surface. Upon the excitation at 488 nm, the fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled aptamer was employed to conjugate with
the NPs to allow them to generate green fluorescence. As shown in Figure 2C, the bright-green
fluorescence dots were observed. These results indicated that the
aptamer has successfully conjugated with the Fe3O4@SiO2 nanocomposites.

2.3 Characterization
of Pd@Au NPs and Pd@Au-Con
A Bioconjugates
It can be seen from Figure 3A–C that the TEM image of the prepared
Pd@Au NPs showed well-defined dendritic nanocomposites with a solid
core and highly branched subunits and were homogeneous in morphology
and size. The SEM image (Figure 3D) of the NPs showed that Pd@Au NPs had a kind of spherical
nanostructures and uniformed dispersion. A magnified SEM image (the
inset of Figure 3D)
showed that the NPs form core–shell structure clearly. To further
characterize Pd@Au NPs, energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) of Pd@Au
NPs is shown in Figure 3E, which demonstrated that the NPs were composed of Pd and Au elements,
demonstrating the formation of a Pd@Au nanostructure. Figure 3F showed the X-ray diffraction
(XRD) of Pd@Au NPs, which was used to investigate the crystal structure
of samples. As shown in Figure 3F, four diffraction peaks appearing at 39.21, 45.59, 66.33,
and 79.78 were fairly matched with Au (reference code: 00-004-0784)
and Pd (reference code: 00-005-0681), which corresponded to the (111),
(200), (220), and (311) planes of the face-centered cubic Pd@Au NPs,
respectively.44

(E) EDS image and (F) XRD pattern of the Pd@Au NPs.

The UV–vis absorption spectrum is shown
in Figure S3. The curve a represented that
the Pd@Au NPs had
no apparent absorption. During the conjugation of Con A, an adsorption
peak at 280 nm (curve c), which belonged to the characteristic absorption
of Con A (curve b), appeared to demonstrate the successful synthesization
of the Pd@Au-Con A bio-composites.

2.4 Characterization
of Pd@Au NP-Modified Electrode
Before evaluating Pd@Au NPs
as labels for cytosensor, we explored
the performance of Pd@Au NPs toward the detection of H2O2 as a consequence of the sensitivity of the cytosensor
that comes from Pd@Au NPs toward the reduction of H2O2. To compare the results, three types of NP-modified electrodes
(Pd, Au, and Pd@Au NPs) were monitored in the same concentration of
H2O2. As shown in Figure S4C, the largest reduction current was measured with the Pd@Au
NP-modified electrode. Meanwhile, the reduction current of the Pd@Au
NPs electrode is even higher than the reduction current of the Pd
NP (Figure S4A) and Au NP (Figure S4B) electrodes together, demonstrating
that the synergetic effect existed in the Pd@Au NPs. It manifests
better catalytic performance of Pd@Au NPs compared with that of individual
Pd NPs and Au NPs of the current study.

To further investigate
the catalytic performance of the obtained NPs upon H2O2 reduction, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed on the Pd@Au
NPs at different scan rates in the presence of 1 mM H2O2 in deoxygenated PBS. As depicted in Figure S5, the reduction peak potentials of H2O2 at about −0.4 V gradually shifts to the negative position
and the reduction peak currents enhance rapidly with the increase
of the scanning rate. In addition, the cathodic currents at −0.4
V were linearly related to the square-root of the scan speed (inset
of Figure S5), manifesting that the electrochemical
process toward H2O2 of the Pd@Au/GCE is a diffusion-confined
process with an irreversible H2O2 electroreduction.

2.5 Electrocatalytic Behaviors of Pd@Au NP-Con
A as a Label
Because the high sensitivity of Pd@Au NPs toward
the detection of H2O2 has been demonstrated;
the cytosensor for detecting 1 × 104 cells mL–1 MCF-7 cells using Pd@Au-Con A as labels were established
and characterized (Figure S6). The sensitivity
of the enzyme-free cytosensors was influenced directly by the catalytic
property of the signal labels. The electrocatalytic performances of
different signal labels including Au NPs-Con A (a), Pd NPs-Con A (b),
and Pd@Au NPs-Con A (c) were investigated to detect MCF-7 cells through
the reduction of H2O2. As expected, the catalytic
currents are the highest for Pd@Au NPs-Con A (Figure S6, curve c), whereas the currents are much weaker
signals detected for Au NPs-Con A (Figure S6, curve a) and Pd NPs-Con A (Figure S6, curve b), respectively. The inset is the response of the cytosensors
to 400 cells mL–1 MCF-7 cells using Pd@Au-Con A
as a label.

2.6 Electrochemical Investigation
of the Cytosensor
CV is used to certify each step in the
process of the cytosensor,
which was carried out in 5 mM Fe(CN)64–/3– containing 0.1 M KCl. As depicted in Figure 4A, for the bare GCE, a pair of reversible
redox peaks were measured (curve a) when Fe3O4@SiO2–NH2/aptamer was coupled onto the
above electrode; the peak current obviously kept falling and the gap
between redox peak potentials became larger (curve b) as a result
of the poor conductivity of aptamer. Subsequently, Fe3O4@SiO2–NH2/aptamer was blocked
with BSA. The peak current was further declined after the following
to capture the target cells (curve d). This decreasing response may
be because of the electronically inert character of BSA and cell.
Finally, the above biocomposite was incubated with the Pd@Au-Con A.
The peak currents had a slight decrease (curve e) as a result of the
bad conductivity of the blocking behaviors of the lectins.

(e) Pd@Au-Con A/MCF-7 cell/BSA/aptamer/Fe3O4@SiO2–NH2/GCE in a solution of 0.1 M

equivalent circuit applied to fit the impedance data. Rs, solution resistance; CPE, constant phase-angle element; Ret, electron-transfer resistance; and Zw, Warburg diffusion resistance.

The EIS was also conducted to confirm the assembly
processes of
cytosensor construction step by step. The Nyquist plot consists of
a straight linear part and a semicircular part. The electron-transfer
kinetics of the redox probe at the electrode surface was regulated
by the electron-transfer resistance (Ret), which is equal to the semicircle diameter.45 As shown in Figure 4B, curve a represented bare GCE and it was nearly a straight
line. After sequential modification of Fe3O4@SiO2–NH2/aptamer (curve b), blocking
of BSA (curve c), capturing of cells (curve d), and coupling with
Pd@Au-Con A nanoprobes (curve e), the resistance increased successively.
The results were consistent with CV. In conclusion, the cytosensor
was established successfully.

2.7 Optimization
of the Experimental Paraments
To obtain the best response
for the detection of cancer cells,
the analytical parameters of the experiment including the concentration
of aptamer, the amount of probe, and incubation time for target cells
and signal probe have been optimized. With the increase of aptamer
concentration, the current increased obviously and then kept a constant
level at concentrations above 20 μM (Figure S7A), demonstrating that the aptamer on the surface of Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs was enough to capture the
cells. With a prolonging cell incubation time, the current increased
step by step and reached an identical value after 90 min (Figure S7B), which indicated the saturated capture
of MCF-7 cells at the BSA/aptamer/Fe3O4@SiO2–NH2/GCE surface. Moreover, the current
was also connected with the volume of nanoprobe solution and trended
the largest value at 60 μL (Figure S7B). The current value was rapidly increased as the incubation time
increased and reached a maximum for 60 min, which suggested the saturation
identified between Con A and glycan (Figure S7D). Therefore, the best parameters to detect cells were 20 μM
for aptamer, 60 μL for volume of signal probe, and 90 and 60
min for incubation time of cell and probe, respectively.

2.8 Analysis and Detection of the Cytosensor
Upon the best
detection parameters, the cytosensor was conducted
by using a chronoamperometric technique in deoxygenated PBS. As displayed
in Figure 5A, the catalytic
currents increased obviously with the increase of cell amounts, indicating
that the MCF-7 cells are attached onto the interface of the biosensor.
The H2O2 catalytic response was connected with
the concentrations of captured cells. The catalytic current value
has a linear relationship with the logarithmic value of cell concentration
ranging from 100 to 1 × 106 cells mL–1 with the limit of detection (LOD) down to 30 cells mL–1 (Figure 5B). The
regression equation was expressed as: I (μA)
= −17.9 × log C cell + 19.97, where I is the catalytic current of H2O2. In view
of the volume of MCF-7 cell suspension being 100 μL, the established
method could realize the LOD down to three cells, which was superior
to those previous reports and is listed in Table 1. It manifested that the developed electrochemical
biosensor to detect MCF-7 cells exhibited a wide linear range and
excellent sensitivity. The high sensitivity could be attributed to
the combination of the signal enhancement by the Pd@Au-Con A nanoprobe
catalyst of the reduction of H2O2; the advantage
of the large surface of Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs improves the ability to capture cells and enhances the sensitivity
of the cytosensor.

2.9 Specificity, Reproducibility, and Stability
of the Cytosensor
The specificity of the established cytosensor
was assessed through the chronoamperometric method. The current response
signals of the cytosensor were compared with the EpCAM low and negative
tumor cells, containing the MCF-10A, MB-MDA-231 cell, and HEK-293T.53 According to the prediction, if the cell membrane
lacks EpCAM, it will inhibit the SYLC3-aptamer-coupled sensor surface.
When the SYLC3-aptamer-coupled sensor was incubated with the control
cell of equal concentration 1 × 104 cells mL–1, ignorable or minimum responses were observed, demonstrating that
the proposed sensor can effectively recognize the MCF-7 cells with
good specificity and binding affinity from the mixing cells (Figure S8A). To evaluate the possibility of the
proposed method to detect MCF-7 cells in multiple cell suspensions,
the same method was conducted in mixed cell solution at same concentrations
of MCF-7, MCF-10A, MB-MDA-231, and HEK-293T cells. As shown in the Figure S8A, even though the current response
in mixed cell suspensions revealed a slight deviation, it was nearly
same as the MCF-7 cell alone, indicating that the established sensor
is feasible to detect MCF-7 cell in complicated mixtures. The possibility
of the outstanding selectivity is the SYLC3–aptamer possessing
a strong binding ability to EpCAM-high expression of MCF-7 cells,
whereas not to the EpCAM negative cells (HEK-293T), and EpCAM-low
expression of cancer cells (MCF-10A and MB-MDA-231).

To investigate
the reproducibility of the cytosensor, five measurements were investigated
identically in PBS containing the same concentration (1 × 104 cells mL–1) of MCF-7 cells (Figure S8B). The relative standard deviation
was 5.8%, indicating that the presented cytosensor exhibited good
reproducibility.

Stability plays an important role in the application
of cytosensor.
The stability was explored at 1 × 106 cells mL–1 of MCF-7 cells and each reading denotes the mean
value of five measurements. It can be seen from Figure S8, the current response of the established cytosensor
decreased to about 89.3% of its original value after 7 days. These
negligible decreases of the current responses demonstrate an excellent
stability of the cytosensor.

In conclusion, the proposed electrochemical
cytosensor possessed
a prominent level of selectivity, reproducibility, and stability,
which manifest that the prepared cytosensor was suitable for quantitative
determination of CTCs.

The established cytosensor was applied to
evaluate the dynamic change of N-glycan expression on the cell surface
upon treatment of drugs. Primarily, TM and BG were selected as the
inhibitors of N-glycan and O-glycan expression on cell surface under
the treatment for a successive 48 h (Figure 6A,B). Compared with control experiment, a
gradual decreasing current signal can be measured upon the TM-treated
cells. The chronoamperometric current signal alteration was 41.4%
after 48 h of treatment. It is because of the fact that the TM restrained
the first step in the biosynthesis of the N-glycosylation; therefore,
the Con A hardly conjugates with the target cells effectively, which
dramatically suppressed the capability for cell capture.54 To confirm the observed change, confocal scanning
microscopy was conducted to assay the treating MCF-7 cells in the
stain with FITC-combined Con A (Figure S9). The cells showed weaker fluorescence intensity upon the incubation
with TM for 48 h, and the change of fluorescence was calculated to
be 38.2%. However, the amount of BG was much higher than that of TM,
nearly no change of chronoamperometric current of BG-treated cells
was observed compared to untreated cells. It is because that BG could
block the O-glycosylation but does not interfere N-glycosylation.55 Upon different inhibitors between TM and BG,
the electrochemical signals confirm that most of the N-glycans on
the cell surface could be identified and assessed by the proposed
cytosensor.

Figure 6 (A) N-Glycan expression of MCF-7 cell surface without or with treatment
of TM (10 μg mL–1), BG (500 μM), and
PNGase F (2000 NEB units) for 48 h. (B) N-glycan expression on the
MCF-7 cells surface treated: (a) without and (b) with TM (10 μg
mL–1) at different times. The current was obtained
at −0.4 V (vs SCE) in PBS (0.01 M, pH 7.4) containing 5 mM
H2O2. CV scan rate: 100 mV s–1. The MCF-7 cell concentration: 1 × 105 cells mL–1.

Meanwhile, PNGase F,
as an amidase, was applied to cleave N-linked
proteins.56 It can be seen from Figure 6A, the chronoamperometric
signal of PNGase F incubated cells dramatically decreased to 39.5%
by contrast with untreated cells. Moreover, the decreased level was
indicated by flow cytometry (Figure S10), and the average value diminished to 43.1% after enzymatic release.
Therefore, the proposed electrochemical method not only provided direct
and sensitive in situ profile for determining the dynamic change of
N-glycans expression influenced by inhibitors but also could roughly
screen the inhibitors of N-glycan.

3 Conclusions
Herein, a novel nonenzymatic amperometric nanobiosensor has been
fabricated for the ultrasensitive determination of CTCs and synchronous
evaluation of N-glycan dynamical expression on CTC surface. With the
assistance of Fe3O4@SiO2 nanocarriers,
SYL3C aptamer and Pd@Au-Con A nanoprobes, and Fe3O4@SiO2/aptamer/cell/nanoprobes sandwich-type architecture
were established on a GCE. This cytosensor provides a wide detection
linear ranging from 100 to 1 × 106 cells mL–1 with a detection limit as low as 30 cells mL–1. In contrast with the previously reported cytosensors, the biosensor
exhibits excellent capability for cancer cell detection with high
sensitivity and good repeatability. Moreover, the developed cytosensor
could effectively monitor the variation of cell surface glycans interfered
by the external treatment. According to these excellent new properties
of our cytosensor, it may have a great potential for clinical applications
in the early diagnosis of cancer as well as contributing to reveal
N-glycan-related biological processes and diseases.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Cell Culture and Treatment
The MCF-7,
MCF-10A, HEK-293T, and MB-MDA-231 cell lines were obtained from KeyGen
Biotech. Co. Ltd. (Nanjing, China). The cells were grown in Roswell
Park Memorial Institute 1640 medium (high glucose, KeyGen Biotech
Corp., Ltd., Nanjing) added with 10% fetal calf serum (KeyGen Biotech
Corp., Ltd., Nanjing) in a humidified incubator (5% CO2, 37 °C). At the logarithmic growth phase, the cells were collected
by “digestion–centrifugation” procedure. Then,
the cells were purified with sterile PBS twice. In the external stimuli
study, TM-, BG-, and PNGase F-treated MCF-7 cells were obtained in
a culture medium by adding 10 μg mL–1 (approximately
12 μM) TM, 500 μM BG, and PNGase F (2000 NEB units) by
incubating 1 × 105 cells mL–1, respectively.

4.2 Synthesis of Aptamer-Functionalized Aminated
Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs
The Fe3O4 NPs were prepared through a one-pot reaction
by a modification, as described in the previous protocol.57 To prevent aggregation of Fe3O4 and improve the availability of combination with aptamer,
it was modified by silanization and amination before combination.
These processes were conducted in terms of the previous method without
any modification.58

The aptamer-functionalized
aminated Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs were synthesized
through cross-linking by GA. Briefly, 5 mg of aminated Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs was suspended in 7.5 mL of PBS
(0.01 M, pH 7.4). Subsequently, GA solution (2.5 mL, 2.5 wt %) was
added to the above solutions. The suspension was mechanically agitated
for 6 h at 25 °C. Then, the obtained product was purified with
PBS to get rid of the redundant GA. The purified sample was resuspended
in 10 mL of PBS. Then, 1 mL of the as-prepared aminated Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs (0.5 mg mL–1)
was mixed with the amine-modified aptamer (50 μL, 20 μM)
and incubated for 12 h with gentle shaking. Then, the prepared composite
was purified three times with PBS and separated by an external magnetic
force. Next, the nonspecific binding sites were blocked by the addition
of BSA solution (100 μL, 1 wt %) to the above solution for 1
h. The prepared Fe3O4@SiO2–NH2/aptamer/BSA conjugate was purified three times with PBS under
the external magnet and ultimately redispersed in PBS (0.5 mL) and
stored in the refrigerator for the next study.

4.3 Synthetization
of Pd@Au-Con A Nanoprobes
The porous Pd@Au NPs were synthesized
by following a reported method36 with a
corresponding modification. In brief,
2 mL of Na2PdCl4 solution (10 mM), 0.5 mL of
HAuCl4 aqueous solution (10 mM), and HDPC (0.1 g) were
diluted in distilled water (25 mL) under stirring. Subsequently, AA
solution (1.5 mL, 0.1 M) was added into the mixture rapidly. In addition,
the above solution was maintained at 35 °C for 3 h. After that,
the black products were purified under “centrifugation-wash-centrifugation”
steps with distilled water and ethanol several times. Moreover, the
resulting samples were dried for 24 h at 60 °C. Finally, the
obtained porous Pd@Au NPs (0.02 g) were resuspended in 4 mL of ultrapure
water.

The Pd@Au-Con A bioconjugates were prepared by 500 μL
of the as-obtained Pd@Au NPs solution, and 100 μL of Con A solution
(2 mM) was mixed into 10.0 mL of ultrapure water under slight mechanical
stirring overnight at 4 °C. Subsequently, the supernatant was
discarded under centrifugation, and the precipitate was purified with
ultrapure water several times and resuspended with 1.0 mL of PBS containing
1 mM Mn2+ and Ca2+ to remain the binding affinity
of Con A and stored at 4 °C.

4.4 Fabrication
of the Cytosensor
Fe3O4@SiO2–NH2/aptamer/BSA
conjugate suspension (100 μL; 1.0 mg mL–1)
was mixed with 100 μL of MCF-7 cell suspension at various concentrations
and incubated at 37 °C for 90 min. Under the external magnet
force, the mixture was washed with a binding buffer to get rid of
the free cells. Subsequently, the Fe3O4@SiO2–NH2/aptamer/BSA and MCF-7 cell complex
(Fe3O4@SiO2–NH2/aptamer/BSA/MCF-7 cells) was further mixed with 60 μL of signal
probe, incubated at 37 °C for 60 min to combine with the cells
by specific identification, and purified with PBS several times to
remove the excess Pd@Au-Con A complexes after magnetic separation.
In the end, the cytosensor was resuspended in 200 μL of PBS
and stored at 4 °C for usage.

4.5 Electrochemical
Assay of the Sandwich-type
Cytosensor
Generally, the GCE was polished carefully by 0.3
and 0.05 μm of Al2O3 powders before surface
modification. After washing thoroughly, the pretreated GCE was coated
with 6 μL of sandwich-architecture cytosensors with various
concentrations of cells. For amperometric determination of the cytosensor,
−0.4 V was chosen as the detection potential. After the current
was stable under stirring, 10 μL of (5 M) H2O2 was added into PBS under gentle stirring, and the current
change was recorded. The CV and EIS were recorded in 5 mM [Fe (CN)6]3–/4– containing 0.1 M KCl.
