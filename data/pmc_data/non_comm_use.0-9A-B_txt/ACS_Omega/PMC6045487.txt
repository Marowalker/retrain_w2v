Because of their
potent cytotoxic activity, members of the auristatin
family (synthetic analogues of the naturally occurring dolastatin
10) have remained a target of significant research, most notably in
the context of antibody drug conjugate payloads. Typically, modifications
of the backbone scaffold of dolastatin 10 have focused on variations
of the N-terminal (P1) and C-terminal (P5) subunits. Scant attention
has been paid thus far to the P4 subunit in the scientific literature.
In this paper, we introduce an azide functional group at the P4 subunit,
resulting in potent cytotoxic activity seen in vitro. Another highly
active compound in this study contained azide functional groups in
both the P2 and P4 subunits and required dolavaline as the P1 subunit
and a phenylalanine as the P5 subunit. Furthermore, these two azide
groups served not only as modifiers of cytotoxicity but also as handles
for linker attachment or as a tether for use in the synthesis of a
macrocyclic analogue.

Introduction
Naturally occurring
peptides have been shown to be potent antibiotic
agents, causing cell death at picomolar or low nanomolar concentrations.1 Tubulin-binding natural products, especially
vinca domain inhibitors, have played an important role in cancer research
for decades.2−5 One of them, the natural product dolastatin 10 (1),
isolated from the sea hare Dolabella auricularia, was discovered by Pettit et al.6 Dolastatin
10 (1) and its synthetic analogues (termed “auristatins”)
(i.e., TZT-1027) demonstrated extraordinary cytotoxicity with sub-nanomolar
activity in vitro toward a variety of cancer cell lines. However,
when tested in the clinic, no significant activity was observed at
the maximum tolerated dose.7−19 Given these clinical results, and the likelihood that the lack of
activity was due to the potency/toxicity of this class of compound
as a small-molecule chemotherapeutic, many research groups have engaged
in studies of synthetic dolastatin 10 derivatives as cytotoxic payloads
in targeted therapies. The auristatin molecular class has found considerable
application within the field of antibody drug conjugates (ADCs), with
the goal to widen a clinically relevant therapeutic window. One targeted
therapy approach has used an auristatin E (2a) derivative,
monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE, 2b), as the active payload
in ADCETRIS20 (Figure 1B). Other auristatin family members are under
investigation as payloads in a variety of ADCs currently in clinical
trials.21

Figure 1 Structure of dolastatin 10 (1) (panel A) and auristatin
analogues (2a, 2b, and 3) (panel
B).

Dolastatin 10 (1)
consists of four amino acid building
blocks, dolavaline (Dov, P1), valine (Val, P2), dolaisoleuine (Dil,
P3), and dolaproine (Dap, P4), and the C-terminal amine dolaphenine
(Doe, P5) (Figure 1A). Figure 1B illustrates
the structure of auristatin analogues.22,23 Many research
groups have studied linear dolastatin 10 analogues and this area has
been extensively reviewed.23 In particular,
numerous N-terminal P1 subunit and C-terminal P5 subunit modifications
were performed by Pettit et al., Miyazaki et al., and other groups
to investigate their structure–activity relationship (SAR).24−26 In our recent report, we investigated the incorporation of heterocycles
into the P5 subunit.27 These P5 heterocycle
modifications generated ADCs with more hydrophilic character and lower
aggregation.

Modification of the core central peptides (P2–P4
subunits)
has not been as extensively investigated because it has been reported
that changes in these subunits result in attenuated compound potency.23 In terms of the P2 subunit, substitution of
the natural valine residue with leucine or isoleucine is reported26 and our group recently reported SAR results
for analogues containing heteroatoms and other non-natural amino acids
in the P2 position.28 In contrast, regarding
the P4 subunit, there are a few reports of analogues with mannose-
and glucose-derived sugar amino acids as replacements for the Dap
portion by Gajula et al.29,30 and also hydroxyl,
methoxy, and amino substituents on the pyrrolidine are described by
Park et al.31

Discussed here are
new linear dolastatin 10 analogues with an azide
substituted P4 central amino acid and also in combination with P2
azide substitution. These azide substitutions show changes in cytotoxicity
and can serve as a handle for linker attachment or a tether for use
in the synthesis of novel macrocyclic dolastatin 10 analogues (Figures 2 and 3).

Results and Discussion
In our previous
studies, we reported SAR results for auristatins
containing specific P2 side chain modifications. We showed that P2-modified
analogues, with the P2 units as 3S-amino-2S-aminobutyric acid (Abu (3-NH2)), 3S-azide-2S-aminobutyric acid (Abu (3-N3)), and 3S-hydroxyl-2S-aminobutyric
acid (Abu (3-OH)), could display high in vitro cytotoxic activity
(Figure 2).28 Building from this previous work, we investigated
whether central P4-modified analogues containing heteroatom substituents
on the pyrrolidine ring retained cytotoxic potency with and without
P2 heteroatom modifications. In addition, we examined the potency
associated with a constrained macrocyclic dolastatin 10 analogue.
The published PF-06380101 tubulin crystal data revealed a critical
hydrogen bond network between Asp β177 and the amide carbonyl
of Phe α351 with the protonated amino group of P1, a bifocal
interaction of the N-2 valine with Asn α329, and also between
the backbone amide of Tyr β222 with the terminal carbonyl groups
of Dap and Doe (Figure 3A).32 Moreover, the cis Val-Dil amide
bond and trans Dil-Dap amide bond geometries were revealed in a cocrystal
structure with tubulin (Figure 3A).32,33 We presumed that a tether between
the P2 and P4 subunits enables the formation of a macrocyclic structure
that could force cis/trans geometry across these relevant bonds (Figure 3B).

The synthesis
route of the azide-containing dipeptide intermediate
is shown in Scheme 1. syn-Aldol product 7 was prepared from chiral proline
aldehyde 5 and the boron enolate of chiral (R)-oxazolidinone 6 with moderate yield.31,34 After methylation and tert-butyl dimethyl silyl
deprotection, introduction of the azide group was performed by Mitsunobu-type
chemistry using diphenylphosphoryl azide (DPPA) and diisopropyl azodicarboxylate
(DIAD) to provide Boc-Dap (4-N3)-phenyloxazolidinone 8. Hydrolysis of the chiral auxiliary unit on compound 8 was accomplished using LiOH and H2O2, which led to the desired carboxylic acid Boc-Dap (4-N3)-OH 9. Boc-dipeptide 10 was formed using
1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDCI)
and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole hydrate (HOBt) to couple compound 9 with phenylalanine methyl ester (H-Phe-OMe). HCl-mediated
Boc deprotection yielded compound 11.

in Scheme 2. The P4–P5
intermediate, 11, and the separately prepared P1–P3
intermediates, 12a–c, were coupled in a modular
manner to yield final dolastatin analogues 13a, 13b, and 13c.

The synthesis of a macrocyclic dolastatin derivative
is shown in Scheme 3. The reduction of
the azide group of the P1–P3 intermediate 14,
followed by the ring-opening reaction with glutaric anhydride, provided
carboxylic intermediate 16. The coupling reaction of
carboxylic acid 16 and amine 17 followed
by the deprotection of the Boc group and tert-Bu
ester hydrolysis provided macrocyclic precursor 18. Macrocyclization
was achieved through reaction using the Mukaiyama condensation reagent,
2-chloro-1-methylpyridinium iodide (CMPI), under high dilution conditions
(0.00014 M). Finally, the deprotection of the Fmoc group using Et2NH gave the desired macrocyclic analogue 19 in
high yield (c–e, three steps; 61%).

Table 1 highlights
the in vitro potency of each compound with respective P1, P2, and
P4 unit modifications. Each compound was evaluated in an in vitro
cell proliferation assay using an acute myeloid leukemia cell line
(MOLM13) and a bladder cancer cell line (SW780) (see the Supporting Information). Compounds 2b, 13a, 13b, and 13c demonstrated
similar GI50 values (within 1 log) in both MOLM13 and SW780
cell lines; however, the SW780 cell line appeared less sensitive overall
in this experiment. In our previous studies evaluating P2 modifications,28 we determined that modification of the P2 side
chain required a specific aromatic P5 subunit (containing an ester
or amide functional group), which did not follow previously reported
SAR trends for P2 valine-based auristatins.23 On the basis of these results, we held the aromatic P5 ester units
unchanged while examining the SAR of P4 azide introduction. Compound 13a, containing an azide only in the P4 central peptide, demonstrated
a similar activity in vitro when compared to MMAE (2b) in the MOLM13 cell line. Next, we explored combinations of both
P4 and P2 azide modifications. Compound 13b, with P2
Abu (3-N3) and a MeVal unit in the P1 position, showed
a similar GI50 value in the MOLM13 cell line compared to 13a (0.279 and 0.224 nM, respectively). Interestingly, compound 13c, with P2 and P4 azide modifications and Dov in the P1
position, showed enhanced cytotoxic activity (GI50 = 0.057
nM) compared to compound 13b. One possible explanation
of the cytotoxicity is that analogue 13c, the pentapeptide
containing two azide groups in the P2 and P4 positions, could take
a more favorable conformation by electric and steric effects arising
from the azide groups.35,36 To date, it was known that structural
changes in the dolastatin Dap P4 subunit did not significantly compromise
the cytotoxic potency, even though the P1 unit was Dov.29−31 However, our research revealed that the modification to the Dap
moiety has shown to be beneficial in improving the potency. In contrast,
the macrocyclic analogue 19 showed a low in vitro potency,
and these differences in cytotoxicity may be explained by differences
in cellular membrane permeability reflected in the compound calculated
hydrophilicity measurements, log D pH 7.4/6.5 and
topological polar surface area (TPSA) (Table 1). This inability for some molecules to cross
the cell membrane changes when they are attached to an antibody as
antibodies can transport the attached molecule across the cell membrane
and have the ability to release the payload inside the cell. This
has been shown for MMAF (monomethyl auristatin F)-derived ADCs, which
are highly potent despite the low membrane permeability of MMAF (Figure 1).28,37 Further investigation is needed to determine whether an ADC composed
of a drug linker prepared from compound 19 demonstrates
cytotoxicity. Additionally, 1H NMR data gathered for macrocyclic
analogue 19 did not show cis/trans amide signals found
in the linear compound 13b (see the Supporting Information), indicating a constrained amide bond
geometry and relative enhancement of rigidity. Given the more rigid
structure of the macrocyclic analogue compared to the linear analogue,
it may also be possible that macrocyclic analogue 19 was
forced into a less favorable conformation by the relatively rigid
structure. Studies are ongoing to elucidate a cocrystal structure
of tubulin with compound 13a and with compound 19 to reveal the conformation of the Val-Dil and Dil-Dap amide
bond geometries and the binding mode with tubulin to enable further
design optimizations and investigation of tethers for preparation
of potent macrocyclic dolastatin 10 analogues.

triplicate runs with compound purity above >90%.

b log D and TPSA
values were calculated with ACD/PhysChem Batch (version 12.01).

Through this work, we have also
confirmed that azide groups introduced
into the P2 and P4 subunits demonstrate the possibility for serving
as handles for linker attachment.

The synthesis of drug linkers
using a P2 or P4 linkage is shown
in Scheme 4. The click
reaction38 of compound 20 and N-(but-3-yn-1-yl)-2-chloroacetamide proceeded smoothly to
yield compound 21. Deprotection of the Boc group and
subsequent coupling to the P4–P5 dimer 11 yielded
the desired drug linker 22. Payload 13a,
containing the P4 azide group, gave drug linker 23 directly
using the click reaction with N-(but-3-yn-1-yl)-2-bromoacetamide.
These examples, using noncleavable linkers, suggest that payloads
that incorporate azide groups could serve as linker attachment sites
for other noncleavable or cleavable linkers. Thus, compounds 13a–c are promising payloads for preparation of novel
drug linkers at the P2 or P4 position.

Conclusions
We revealed that the modification of the Dap unit has proven to
be beneficial in improving potency. Compounds with a P4-modified azide
group on the pyrrolidine ring demonstrate cytotoxic activity in vitro.
In particular, the dolastatin 10 analogues with azide modifications
on both P2 and P4 showed enhanced cytotoxic activity (GI50 = 0.057 nM) when compared to MMAE. On the contrary, the macrocyclic
analogue showed poor potency. Possible explanations of these cytotoxicity
values were due to hydrophilicity and conformation of these pentapeptides.
Additional work is now under way to further reveal the amide bond
geometries and the binding mode of these compounds. We also demonstrated
that the analogue containing an azide group can serve as sites of
linker attachment in the preparation of ADCs.

was stirred in 4.0 M HCl in dioxane (2.4 mL, 4 mmol). After 3 h, analysis
by LC–MS showed that the reaction was complete. The crude reaction
mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure. A total of 89 mg
of compound 21 was obtained as the HCl salt (0.19 mmol,
99%) as an off-white amorphous solid. 1H NMR (400 MHz,
DMSO-d6; a complex spectrum was observed,
presumably because of conformational isomers): δ 9.83 (s, 1H),

Compound 22
To a stirred solution of compound 21 (24 mg,
0.04 mmol) and H-Dap (N3)-Phe-OMe HCl
salt 11 (15 mg, 0.04 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (3 mL) were added DIEA (25 μL, 0.140 mmol), EDCI (18 mg, 0.09
mmol), and HOBt (5 mg, 0.03 mmol). After 18 h, analysis by LC–MS
showed that the reaction conversion was complete. The reaction mixture
was diluted with H2O and DMAc, and then the mixture was
purified by preparatory RP-HPLC with a Phenomenex Gemini-NX 10 μm,
C18 110 Å column (150 × 30 mm2) using 5–95%
MeCN in 0.05% aqueous TFA solution as the eluent. A total of 24 mg
of compound 22 was recovered as the TFA salt (0.022 mmol,
59%) as a white amorphous solid. LC–MS tR = 1.29 min, m/z: 973.83,
975.85 [M + H]+; HRESIMS m/z: 973.5387 [M + H]+ calcd for C46H74ClN12O9, 973.5385.

Compound 23
To a stirred solution of compound 13a (15
mg, 0.017 mmol) and N-(but-3-yn-1-yl)-2-bromoacetamide
(5 mg, 0.026 mmol) in DMF (1 mL) was added CuBr (10 mg, 0.067 mmol).
After 15 h, analysis by LC–MS showed that the reaction was
complete. The crude suspension was diluted with 7 mL of DMAc, 2 mL
of 0.5 M EDTA, and 5 mL of water. The mixture was purified by preparatory
RP-HPLC using MeCN in 0.05% aqueous TFA as the eluent. A total of
5 mg of compound 23 (4.58 μmol, 28%) was obtained
as a white amorphous solid. 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6; a complex spectrum was observed, presumably
because of cis/trans conformational isomers): δ 8.80 (d, J = 8.6 Hz, 2H), 8.65 (s, 1H), 8.38–8.29 (m, 1H),
