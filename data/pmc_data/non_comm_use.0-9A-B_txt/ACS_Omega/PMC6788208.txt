We report on a simple
and versatile method for the preparation
in one-step of omniphobic textiles, using only aqueous suspensions
of silica particles and polyurethane devoid of long perfluoroalkyl
chains (C8) that are now legally-banned because of severe environmental
concerns. The omniphobic coatings can be applied on different substrates
including fabrics, can resist acidic and basic conditions and a moderate
number of washing cycles, and repel liquids such as n-octane, dodecane, hexadecane, ethylene glycol, glycerol, olive oil,
and water. Analysis of the wetting properties of coated fabrics indicates
that the liquid repellence results from the trapping of air in the
re-entrant roughness created by aggregates of silica particles, together
with the low surface tension of the polyurethane which bears legally
accepted short perfluoroalkyl chains (C4). Our study is a significant
step forward toward achieving more environmentally-friendly and robust
omniphobic textiles.

Introduction
Water
repellence and oil repellence are important properties for
outdoor and professional fabrics. This repellence is customarily provided
by coatings comprising long perfluoroalkyl chains of structure R-(CF2)n-R′ (long meaning n > 6 in the present context). However, serious environmental
and health concerns have emerged regarding the use of materials containing
long perfluoroalkyl chains, because these degrade into long-chain
perfluoroalkyl acids which are very persistent in the environment
and bioaccumulate in wildlife and human bodies.1,2 Therefore,
the use of fluorinated materials containing long perfluoroalkyl chains,
even when grafted as side chains, is under strict regulatory control
in the EU and USA.3,4 Even better, an agreement among
more than 180 countries was reached on May 3, 2019, to definitively
ban the production and use of long perfluoroalkyl chains, resulting
in a global phasing-out of these chemical products of very high concern.5

Although a series of alternative products
exist for water repellence,
such as silicone- or wax-based formulations, effective oil-repellent
formulations devoid of long perfluoroalkyl chains remain much more
elusive. Oil- and solvent repellence is required, for example, for
protective personal equipment, medical items, or fabrics used in the
proximity of fuels and lubricants. Not surprisingly, most scientific
publications reporting on strongly oleophobic coatings are still based
on long perfluoroalkyl chains and nonsustainable processing methodologies.6−14 They also frequently involve the use of organic solvents compatible
with perfluorinated compounds, which are often severely toxic and/or
environmentally harmful (e.g., dichloropentafluoropropane15). As an alternative, materials containing shorter
perfluoroalkyl side chains (n ≤ 6) have been
developed by manufacturers. Unfortunately, they are, when n ≤ 4, significantly less effective in terms of oleophobicity
compared to longer perfluoroalkyl chain-containing materials (shorter
chains being worse in this respect). Even though such short fluorocarbon
chains also rise concerns and might as well become controlled in a
longer-term future,2 their more widespread
use could nevertheless be considered as a significant step forward
in the transition toward environmentally-friendly and sustainable
oleophobic coatings.

Here, we show that the oil repellence of
fabric coatings based
on polyurethane comprising only short perfluoroalkyl chains (n = 4) can be significantly boosted by increasing the coating
roughness with silica particles, using a simple one-step aqueous-based
spraying process leading to coatings with reasonably good chemical
and washing resistance. The resulting coatings are thus not only compatible
with the current ban of longer perfluoroalkyl chains but they are
also made from a very benign solvent in a trivially simple and green
process.

Our coatings are actually very close to superomniphobic,
combining
(super)hydrophobicity and (super)oleophobicity. Omniphobic surfaces
provide access to attractive properties such as stain-proofing and
self-cleaning,9,16 chemical shielding,17 or easy droplet manipulation.7,8 Superhydrophobicity
is well known to result from the roughening of the surface of a material
of low surface tension,6,18,19 which can be achieved by a variety of straightforward methodologies
as reviewed elsewhere.20−22 An example from our own work is provided by environmentally-friendly
superhydrophobic fabrics made by a three-step dip-coating process
in water-based silicone and particle suspensions.23 In contrast, more stringent and critical requirements have
to be met to reach superoleophobicity: re-entrant surface structures
(overhangs) and extremely low surface tensions are usually needed.10,12,13,15,24−29 Creating re-entrant surface structures was performed before by a
variety of methodologies such as lithography, etching, replica molding,
layer-by-layer deposition, phase separation, or polymerization.6−8,11,12,14−17,24−26 Here, we demonstrate that the combination of silica
particles and a polymer bearing only short-chain perfluoroalkyl chains
can lead to efficient omniphobic coatings for textile applications,
using a simple, one-step aqueous methodology. We study quantitatively
the correlation between roughness and repellence of the coatings and
indicate the main design parameters which control omniphobicity. Our
study thus aims at demonstrating that it is possible to design efficient
coatings while moving away from environmentally harmful processes
and systems and at providing rational ways to design more sustainable
oleophobic textile coatings.

Results and Discussion
The water-based
suspension comprised of silica particles (Tixosil
365 from Solvay), polyurethane containing short perfluoroalkyl chains
(n = 4, PM-900 from 3M), and an oxime-protected isocyanate
chain extender (PHOBOL XAN from Huntsman). All materials are commercially
available, and no organic solvent was employed in the formulation.
The absence of C6 and C8 perfluoroalkyl substances and fluorotelomer
alcohols was verified with chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry
(see Table S1 in the Supporting Information). The omniphobic surfaces were obtained by spray-coating the omniphobic
formulation on the substrate (Figure 1) followed by thermal annealing to dry the coating
and promote the reaction between the hydroxyl groups of the polyurethane
and the isocyanate groups of the temperature-deprotected extender.

Figure 1 Sketch
of the one-step preparation of omniphobic coatings on a
substrate by spraying the water-based formulation developed in this
work.

The polyester (PES) fabric shown
in Figure 2 is a typical
omniphobic fabric obtained
by spray-coating a one-pot water-based formulation containing 1.2
wt % polyurethane, 0.12 wt % chain extender, and 1.25 wt % silica
particles. The measured water and olive oil contact angles on this
specific sample are 148° and 144°, respectively, indicating
super repellence to both water and olive oil (Figure 2a). Movies S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information show the easy
roll-off of water and olive oil when dropped onto the tilted treated
omniphobic fabric. Figure 2b,c shows top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images
of the modified fabric, indicating a good uniformity of the coating
and confirming the presence of nanoscale porous structures on the
fiber surface arising from aggregates of the silica particles. In
order to obtain a three-dimensional view of the coating, also microtomed
cross-sections of the treated fabric were analyzed (Figure 2d–f). The large-scale
optical microscopy image of Figure 2d provides a view of the fabric structure, whereas
the SEM image of Figure 2f reveals the distribution of silica particles in the coating and
confirms the existence of large porosity and the presence of re-entrant
structures and overhangs. The thickness of the coating was found to
vary from ca. 1 to 10 μm depending on location. Figure 2e is a time-of-flight secondary
ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) image of the cross-section of the
treated fabric, showing the distribution of the fluorinated polyurethane
in the coating. From this image, it can be seen that the polymer penetrates
ca. 30 μm into the fabric, thereby providing mechanical anchoring.

the bare and coated fabric, respectively. (i) AFM topography image
of the surface of the fibers after coating.

The omniphobicity of the coated fabrics results from their high
roughness rT, defined as the ratio between
their developed and projected surfaces. If the components of the formulation
adsorb randomly without significant smoothing of the underlying fabric
texture, the total roughness of the fabric is23,30 1  with rF and rf being the roughness due to the fabric texture
and the surface of the fibers, respectively. The fabric textural roughness
was estimated by stylus profilometry (Figure 2g,h), which provided a view on topography
at a lateral resolution of ca. 1 μm because a stylus of 0.7
μm radius was used. The roughness of the surface of the fibers
was characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM, Figure 2i) by scanning the tip over
surfaces much smaller than the diameter of the textile fibers (ca.
10 μm). For the sample of Figure 2, the roughness of the fiber surface, rf, was significantly modified by the coating process,
increasing from 1.04 ± 0.02 before to 1.81 ± 0.06 after
spraying. In contrast, the fabric textural roughness rF only increased from 1.30 to 1.34 upon spraying. Therefore,
for the sample of Figure 2, the total roughness rT increased
from 1.35 to 2.42 (according to eq 1), indicating that the dominant contribution to the
total roughness arises from the silica particles, not from the fabric
texture.

Both AFM and stylus profilometry only provide access
to the apparent
roughness because the tip or stylus does not probe the sample surface
below overhangs nor in very narrow channels. This actually explains
why the roughness of the fabric measured by profilometry does not
change much upon coating. Overhangs are also responsible for imaging
artifacts in AFM images, such as seen on the left of the central cleft
in Figure 2i. One might
thus wonder whether these measured values of roughness are significant
for our analysis of wetting properties. This is actually the case
when the liquid is not impregnating the fabric, which is the case
considered in this article. The contact angles of water and olive
oil on flat substrates coated with the polyurethane/chain extender
only are 110 and 95°, respectively; because they are larger than
90°, the impregnation parameter is negative, corresponding to
a capillary descent of the fluid in narrow channels.31 Therefore, the coated fabric resists impregnation and traps
air in its texture, resulting in the droplets exploring surfaces that
are not too different from what is probed by the profilometer stylus
or AFM tip. Nevertheless, one should keep in mind that the “liquid-felt”
roughness might differ from the measured roughness by some factor
of order unity.

The correlation between the water and olive
oil contact angles,
and the amount of solid material deposited on the fabric surface was
also studied using the same formulation as for the sample of Figure 2, while changing
the spraying conditions. The result is shown in Figure S5 (Supporting Information) and suggests that a critical
value of the amount of the deposited solid material (ca. 0.3 mg/cm2) should be reached to achieve strong omniphobicity. Figure 2i also indicates
that the aggregate size of silica particles should be in the range
of 200–500 nm for efficient repellence. To understand further
the influence of the structure and roughness of the coating on the
water and oil repellence, a series of coated fabric samples were prepared
with different combinations of concentrations of polyurethane, silica
particles, and chain extender. Reference samples were a pure polyurethane/chain
extender 10:1 w/w film of 1.2 μm thickness deposited on a flat
silicon wafer, a fabric sample coated with this silica-free formulation,
and the bare fabric. The roughness of the fiber surface, rf, was measured by AFM for all samples, and the textural
roughness of the coated fabrics, rF, was
determined by stylus profilometry. The average textural roughness
of the coated fabrics was 1.32 with a standard deviation of 0.04 for
the ten different samples, not significantly different from the value
of the bare fabric (1.30), in agreement with the conclusion drawn
from the examination of the specific sample displayed in Figure 2. Therefore, the
total roughness of the samples was simply computed as the product
of the roughness of the bare fabric and rf (eq 1).

Table S2 lists the different roughness
values of the samples, together with their water and olive oil contact
and roll-off angles. The roughness of the fiber surface first increases
with increasing concentration of silica particles in the formulation
and then displays a small decrease above 1 wt % (Figure S1a). In contrast, no systematic trend can be found
when varying the concentration of the polyurethane in the formulation
(Figure S1a). Likewise, the highest contact
angles are obtained for a concentration of silica particles between
1 and 1.25%, with little if any effect of the concentration in polyurethane
(Figure S1c,d). The contact and roll-off
angles of the samples are plotted versus total roughness rT in Figure 3. Below a threshold roughness rT* of 1.6 and 1.8 for water and
olive oil, respectively, contact angle θc rapidly
increases with rT with no roll-off observed;
above rT*, the contact angle increases much more slowly with total
roughness, whereas the roll-off angle θro rapidly
decreases.

Figure 3 Contact angles (10 μL for water and 5 μL for olive
oil) (a,d) and roll-off angles (c,f) vs total roughness of the coated
fabrics for water (left panels) and olive oil (right panels). The
solid lines are fits of eqs 2 and 3 to the data, respectively, using
as parameters the effective roughness (re) and amount of trapped air (1 – ϕs) displayed
by the discontinuous lines in panels (b,e). The red crosses in (c,f)
indicate no roll-off for the test liquid.

Two factors control the contact angle θc of the
liquids on the prepared coatings: the increased contact surface resulting
from roughness and the trapping of air in the cavities of the roughness
as discussed above. More precisely32 2  with θ0 being the contact
angle measured for a flat and smooth polyurethane/chain extender film, re is the effective roughness of the areas on
which the liquid is in contact with the solid (close to the triple
line), and (1 – ϕs) is the surface fraction
of air-filled cavities. This equation simultaneously combines the
classical Wenzel19 and Cassie18 relationships, with the Wenzel equation cos(θc) = r cos(θ0) being recovered
in the absence of air-trapping cavities (ϕs = 1),
and the classical Cassie equation cos(θ) = ϕs (cos(θ0) + 1) – 1 being obtained in the
absence of roughness below the liquid/solid contact areas.

To model the obtained results, we assumed that, at low roughness, the
liquid/solid interface is a composite of trapped air and solid regions
of relatively large size having a roughness identical to the total
sample roughness, re = rT. Above the threshold roughness rT*, droplets leave
this composite regime to enter a pure Cassie “fakir”
state, in which a substantial amount of air is trapped in the porosity
of the coating and the liquid/solid contact areas are restricted to
very small regions of limited roughness, re ≈ 1. Based on these premises, and assuming that the fraction
of air trapped in the fabric texture increases linearly with total
roughness, with two different slopes below and above rT*, eq 2 could be satisfactorily
fitted to the contact angle data with four parameters only, namely, rT* and the three coefficients needed to describe the linear variations
of ϕs with rT in both
regimes. The solid lines in Figure 3a,d are the fits to the experimental data, whereas
the variations of the effective roughness re and fraction of liquid/solid contact areas ϕs obtained
from the fits are displayed in Figure 3b,e. The fitted threshold roughness rT* was 1.6
and 1.8 for water and olive oil, respectively. Experimental values
for ϕs can then be computed using eq 2 and the fitted effective roughness re (open symbols in Figure 3b,e). For the sample displayed in Figure 2, the surface fraction
of trapped air, 1 – ϕs, was 0.71 and 0.79
in the case of water and olive oil, respectively, confirming the large
amount of trapped air in the structure of the coating.

The roll-off
angles θro measured here are dynamic
angles combining droplet bouncing and roll-off because they measure
the tilt angle of the fabric from which a droplet rolls off when deposited
on the tilted surface. Such measurements are better suited for textiles
which have to resist rain, as they simultaneously consider the effect
of droplet deposition and tilt of the fabric. A precise equation describing
such dynamic roll-off angles is not available; however, roll-off happens
when the gravitational pull on the droplet, which is proportional
to sin(θro), exceeds dissipation and adhesion forces.
Because the adhesion force of the droplet is proportional to its contact
area and therefore to the product of re and ϕs, it follows that 3  in which a and b are two constants.
The discontinuous lines in Figure 3c,f are fits of this equation to the experimental
roll-off angles, using the values of re and ϕs obtained from the fits of the contact angle
data (Figure 3b,e),
with a and b as only fit parameters.
The good agreement between the fits and experimental data confirms
the consistency of our analysis.

The repellence to liquids of
varying Hildebrand solubility parameter
δ and surface tension γ was also assessed for the omniphobic
fabric displayed in Figure 2 (prepared from a water-based formulation containing 1.25%
silica particles, 1.2% polyurethane, and 0.12% chain extender). Figure 4a (bottom panel)
shows that the contact angles on the rough fabric (θc) are zero for the liquids with ca. 16.8 < δ < 26.4 MPa1/2 (cyclohexane, toluene, isopropanol, and dimethyl sulfoxide),
corresponding to liquids which swell the polyurethane of the coating;
accordingly, the apparent contact angles measured for these fluids
on the smooth polyurethane film (θ0) were found to
be very low and to rapidly decrease with time (top panel of Figure 4a). The cosines of
the contact angle on the rough fabric, cos(θc), are
plotted in Figure 4b versus the cosines of the contact angle measured on the smooth
polyurethane film, cos(θ0). The solid line in Figure 4b is a fit of eq 2 to the experimental data
obtained for all nonswelling liquids, taking re = 1 because the fabric is in the Cassie “fakir”
state, only fitting ϕs taken as identical for all
fluids (which is an approximation). A value of 0.78 was thereby obtained
for 1 – ϕs, in quite good agreement with 0.79
and 0.71 found from the analysis of Figure 2 for olive oil and water, respectively. This
confirms that the coating traps a very large amount of air and that
droplets of all tested nonswelling fluids settle in the Cassie “fakir”
state. For fluids for which cos(θ0) > 0 (θ0 < 90°), such as n-octane, n-dodecane and hexadecane, the contact angle should decrease
further in the absence of re-entrant roughness, corresponding to an
enhancement of wettability.31 This is a
further proof that the roughness of the coatings generated by the
spraying process is re-entrant. Therefore, it should be possible to
reach superhydrophobicity even with moderately hydrophilic compounds.25

Figure 4 Resistance of the coated fabrics to liquids and washing.
The data
were obtained on the fabric sample displayed in Figure 2. (a) Cosine of the contact angle of liquids
of different solubility parameters, measured on the smooth polyurethane
film deposited on a silicon wafer (θ0, top panel)
and on the coated fabric (θc, bottom panel). The
test liquids (5 μL droplet) include n-octane
(1), n-dodecane (2), n-hexadecane
(3), cyclohexane (4), toluene (5), isopropanol (6), dimethyl sulfoxide
(7), ethylene glycol (8), glycerol (9), water (10), and olive oil
(11). Red crosses indicate that the test liquid swells the polyurethane
film, resulting in the progressive shift of the values measured on
the smooth film (the red arrows show the variation between the contact
angles measured 10 s and 2 min after droplet deposition). (b) Cosine
of the contact angles measured over the rough coated fabrics (cos
θc) vs the one obtained over the smooth polyurethane
film (cos θ0), for the same series of test liquids
as in panel (a). Red arrows again indicate the change between values
of the contact angle obtained 10 s or 2 min after deposition of a
swelling liquid. The solid line is a fit of eq 2 to the data, with re fixed to 1. (c) Evolution of the water contact and roll-off
angles with number of washing cycles (10 μL water droplet).
(d) i.d. for oil; red crosses mean no roll-off (5 μL oil droplet).

The resistance to machine washing of the omniphobic
fabric displayed
in Figure 2 was also
examined. The contact and dynamic roll-off angles for both water and
olive oil are shown versus the number of washing cycles in Figure 4c,d. After five cycles
of machine washing followed by drying at room temperature, the coated
fabric remained (super)hydrophobic with only a slight decrease of
its water repellent properties (Figure 4c). Additionally, the coated fabric remained (super)oleophobic
up to three washing cycles, with a slight decrease of its olive oil
contact angle from ca. 142° to ca. 139° and a larger increase
of the dynamic roll-off angle from 20–23° to 58–70°.
However, the coated fabric lost its (super)oleophobicity for a larger
number of washing cycles, with no roll-off of olive oil droplets.
SEM images of the coated fabric after washing (Figure S2) indicate that the progressive abrasion of the coating
is responsible for this decrease of performance. However, because
the strategy we developed in this work is a one-pot spray coating
method, the coating might be easily reapplied on the fabrics to restore
the omniphobic properties after a series of washing cycles.

For comparison, the durability of an omniphobic fabric sample,
prepared from an extender-free formulation (no PHOBOL) containing
the same concentration of polyurethane (1.2 wt %) and silica particles
(1.25 wt %), was also assessed. The as-prepared sample was measured
to have water contact and roll-off angles similar to the extender-containing
sample. However, after one washing cycle, the coated fabric lost its
omniphobic, with the water contact angle decreasing to 129° only
and no roll-off observed for both water and olive oil, confirming
the role of the chain extender in the washing resistance of the film.
The resistance of the same extender-containing omniphobic coating
to acidic (HCl, pH 2) and alkaline (NaOH, pH 12) conditions was also evaluated for
different immersion times (Figure S3).
After 3 h immersion in these aqueous solutions, the coated fabrics
remained omniphobic with only a slight decrease of the contact angles
and a slight increase of the roll-off angles for both water and olive
oil.

The developed omniphobic formulations were also applied
on other
substrates such as silicon and glass. Figure S4 of the Supporting Information shows pictures of droplets
of various liquids (including water, glycerol, ethylene glycol, olive
oil, hexadecane, and dodecane) resting on the coated fabric, glass,
and silicon samples. This indicates that the developed omniphobic
formulations are versatile and can be easily applied on various textured
or flat substrates. Hence, the re-entrant roughness generated by the
coating itself is generally sufficient to result in omniphobicity
and does not necessarily need the supplementary roughness provided
by the fabric texture.

Conclusions
In conclusion, a simple
one-step method to prepare omniphobic coatings
is developed. The super repellence is achieved by combining the roughness
and porosity provided by silica particles with the low surface tension
of polyurethane with short perfluoroalkyl chains (C4). The method,
which uses a simple spray-coating technique and commercially available
water-based suspensions, is cost-effective, provides omniphobic coatings
which can resist a moderate number of washing cycles and may easily
be reapplied if necessary. Crucially, it relies on compounds which
are not banned by environmental regulations. As such, it is thus a
significant step toward more environmentally friendly robust superoleophobic
textiles, even though the complete elimination of perfluorinated compounds
is still to be achieved. Analysis of the wetting properties of the
coatings reveals that droplets of liquids ranging from n-octane to water settle in a Cassie “fakir” state with
a proportion of trapped air of ca. 70–80% due to the presence
of re-entrant roughness. Only liquids which swell the polyurethane
were found to be able to impregnate the coatings. Additionally, the
good versatility of the method affords to produce omniphobic surfaces
on different substrates, no matter textured or flat. Therefore, it
can be easily integrated into industrial processes and has a strong
potential for the mass production of environment-friendly and cost-effective
omniphobic surfaces.

Experimental Section
Materials
The
silica particles (Tixosil 365) were kindly
provided by Solvay (Belgium). The average size of individual particles
was measured to be ca. 30–50 nm by transmission electron microscopy
(Figure S6 of the Supporting Information). However, when dispersed in water followed by sonication, the particles
tend to form aggregates. The short perfluoroalkyl chain (C4) polyurethane
emulsion in water (PM-900) was kindly provided by 3M (USA). The PHOBOL
XAN chain extender/cross-linker (oxime-blocked bis-isocyanate) was
provided by Huntsman Corporation (Belgium). The woven PES fabric (105
g/m2) was purchased from Concordia Textiles (Belgium) and
was washed and desized prior to functionalization. Milli-Q water (resistivity
18.2 MΩ·cm) was obtained from a Merck Millipore system
(Milli-Q reference). Olive oil (Extra Virgin, produced in Italy) was
purchased from a local supermarket (Delhaize); n-octane
(>99%, extra pure), n-dodecane (99%, pure), n-hexadecane (99%, pure), ethylene glycol (99%, extra pure),
glycerol (>99%, extra pure), cyclohexane (99%, pure), toluene (>99%,
extra pure), isopropanol (>99.5%, extra pure), and dimethyl sulfoxide
(>99%, extra pure) were from Acros Organics.

Preparation
of Formulations, Coatings, and Cross-Sections of
Coated Fabrics
Formulations
Tixosil 365 silica
particles were first
mixed with water followed by a 10 min ultrasound bath to form silica
particle suspensions of concentration X (X = 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, or 1.5 wt % in the final formulations).
Then, the PM-900 polyurethane and the PHOBOL XAN cross-linker (10:1
weight ratio) emulsions were added to the silica particle suspension,
followed by 5 min stirring. The concentration of polyurethane in water, Y, was 0.6, 1.2, or 1.8 wt % in the final formulations thereby
homogeneous formulations containing silica particles, polyurethane,
and chain extender were obtained.

Coatings
The as-prepared
formulations were placed into
a small sprayer purchased from a local supermarket. The coatings were
prepared by spraying the formulation from the sprayer which was ca.
5 cm away from the horizontally placed substrate until the formulation
fully covered the whole substrate, followed by thermal annealing at
150 °C for 5 min to cross-link the polyurethane.

Cross-Sections
of Coated Fabric
The coated fabric was
embedded into a protective epoxy resin (Epofix cold-setting embedding
resin, purchased from Electron Microscopy Sciences). The cross-sections
were obtained by cutting the protected fabric by a microtome (Leica
Reichert UMFC6) at room temperature. The thickness of the cross-sections
was 5 μm.

Characterization of the Coated Samples
Contact angle
measurements were performed with an OCA 20 goniometer from DataPhysics.
For each sample, a liquid droplet of a certain volume was used (usually
5 or 10 μL when indicated), and the contact angle measurements
were performed at four randomly selected positions. An average value
was computed from these four tests, together with the standard deviation.
It is worth noting that, due to the fact that the fabric is inherently
nonsmooth, there is some uncertainty in the definition of the limiting
lines representing the ideal interface between the fabric and the
testing liquid. This results in the measured contact angle values
to be underestimated; in particular, when entering the Cassie regime,
the contact angle is measured to be ca. 140°, lower than the
conventionally expected value of 150° (see Figure 3). Roll-off angle measurements were performed
by releasing a liquid droplet (10 μL for water and 5 μL
for olive oil) almost in contact with the surface onto the tilted
sample. The roll-off angle was determined as the tilt angle for which
the droplet started to roll off the sample surface. SEM was performed
with a JEOL 7600F operated at 15 kV accelerating voltage. A thin layer
of gold (15 nm) was deposited on the sample surface by sputtering
prior to SEM characterization. Stylus profilometry was done with a
DektakXT from Bruker, using a stylus of 0.7 μm curvature radius
scanned at a rate of 300 μm/s over the fabric surface, with
a sampling resolution of 1 μm in the y-direction,
and 2 μm in the x-direction. AFM was performed
in the tapping mode on Icon Dimension from Bruker. A silicon probe
from nanosensors (force constant ≈ 40 N/m, apex radius of curvature
< 7 nm) was used. AFM and profilometry images were deglitched,
flattened by subtracting a second-order bidimensional polynomial,
and the Wenzel roughness was computed as the average of the function
(1 + (∂h/∂x)2 + (∂h/∂y)2)1/2, in which h(x,y) is the height at location (x, y).

The ToF-SIMS image was obtained by using a ToF-SIMS
5 instrument (IONTOF GmbH, Münster, Germany). A Bi3+ liquid metal-ion source was used to produce the analytical primary
beam (energy 60 keV). An ac target current of 0.003 pA was used with
the analytical burst mode (1 pulse selected with the sine blanker).
Only negative secondary ion species were analyzed. A raster of 512
× 512 data points over an area of 150 μm × 150 μm
was used. The total primary ion beam dose for each analyzed area was
always kept below 1011 ions/cm2, ensuring static
conditions. Lateral resolution of 0.3 μm and mass resolution m/Δm >2000 at 49 m/z were maintained for acquisition of both images
and corresponding spectra for negative ions. Charge compensation was
done by the electron flood gun (Ek = 20
eV).

Washing tests were performed using a Zanussi washing machine
(model
ZWG 1140M). The washing program includes washing at 30 °C, rinsing,
and spinning using minimum water quantity programmed by the machine.
Five grams of the detergent (Le Chat Sensitive) was added during the
washing step.
