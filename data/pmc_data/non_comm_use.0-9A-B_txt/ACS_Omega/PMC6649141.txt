Ru(II)-metallomacrocycles containing
4-pyridyl-1,2,3-triazole moiety
were realized by coordination-driven self-assembly. All new compounds
were characterized by electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry, elemental
analysis, and 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic techniques.
The molecular structure of metallomacrocycle 8 was determined
by single-crystal X-ray crystallography. The anticancer activities
of metallomacrocycles 5–8 were evaluated
by cytotoxicity, cell cycle analysis, and related protein expression.
Metallomacrocycle 7 showed the highest cytotoxicity in
HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells. In addition, apoptotic
HepG2 cells were analyzed when metallomacrocycle 7 was
treated. Our results suggest that metallomacrocycle 7 induces liver cancer cell death by increasing apoptosis and cell
cycle arrest and that it has potential use as an agent for the treatment
of human hepatocellular carcinoma.

Introduction
The
self-assemblies of Ru(II)-based metallomacrocycles1 are of considerable interest owing to their potential
applications for drug delivery, molecular recognition, encapsulation
catalysis, and molecular topology.2−6 Because of cytotoxic properties of Ru(II), there is great interest
in Ru(II)-metallomacrocycles developing new systems for drug discovery
programs.7 In this regard, Ru(II)-based
supramolecules, such as molecular rectangles, cages, and capsules,
are important because they can be easily synthesized and have high
nuclearity and also because of the synergistic effects of incorporated
functionalities. Furthermore, chemical and physical properties, such
as solubility, luminescence, and interactions with biomolecules, can
be achieved by functionalization.8 Our
group and others have previously described the promising antiproliferative
properties of Ru(II)-based metallomacrocycles.9 Triazole is an important heterocyclic ring synthesized by Cu(I)-catalyzed
azide-alkyne cycloaddition (the click reaction) and enables the incorporation
of various functionalities in supramolecules.10 Crowley and co-workers extensively studied the coordination chemistry
of “click” complexes, which display a wide range of
potential applications as catalysts and medicinal agents.11 However, the anticancer activities of Ru(II)-metallomacrocycles
containing the 4-pyridyl-1,2,3-triazole moiety have not been reported
to date.

Worldwide, primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is
the sixth
most common malignancy and is the second cause of human death by cancer.12 HCC is characterized by its high incidence rate
in hepatitis B virus-associated cirrhotic liver disease and is known
to be associated with hepatitis C virus infection, exposure to aflatoxin,
sex, hormones, and some metabolic diseases.13,14Apoptosis is a typical phenomenon of programmed cell death, implicated
in cellular and physiological processes,15,16 and is linked to cell cycle arrest and blockade of the cell cycle,
which are regarded effective strategies for eliminating cancer cells.17 Several apoptotic pathways have been identified
to date, the most significant of which are the intrinsic mitochondria-mediated
and the extrinsic pathways.18 Furthermore,
cell cycle-mediated apoptosis is attracting increasing attention because
it may minimize the risk of acquired drug resistance and is associated
with low mutagenicity and toxicity.19,20 The mammalian
cell cycle is positively regulated by cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks),
which associate to form heterodimeric complexes.21−24 Here, we report the synthesis,
characterization, and anticancer activities of triazole-based Ru(II)-metallomacrocycles,
which were produced during our on-going efforts to synthesized Ru(II)-based supramolecules for biological
applications.

Results and Discussion
Triazole-based
dipyridyl ligand L containing 4-pyridyl-1,2,3-triazole
moiety was prepared by the Cu(I)-catalyzed cycloaddition reaction
(the click reaction) of 4-azidopyridine and 1,4-bis(ethynyl)anthracene
in butanol/water (4:1) at 50 °C to give the desired click product
in 80% yield (Scheme 1). Ligand L was found to be poorly soluble in common
NMR solvents, such as nitromethane, methanol, and DMSO, and thus,
characterization data was obtained in a CD3OD/CDCl3 (1:1) cosolvent mixture. Combined spectroscopic analysis
of ligand L by electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry
(ESI-MS), NMR spectroscopy, and elemental analysis confirmed its formation
and the incorporation of the 4-pyridyl-1,2,3-triazole moiety into
anthracene. Previous reports on “click ligands” have
mainly focused on the 2-pyridyl-1,2,3-triazole moiety and its coordination
with different metals. Using the above-mentioned synthetic method,
various functionalities can be introduced and fine tuning of the properties
of resulting complexes can be achieved. Furthermore, the anthracene
moiety incorporated in ligand L has been utilized in
arene-ruthenium metallomacrocycles for biological application.25 Ligand L is designed in such a
way that synergistic effects of functionalities incorporated can be
utilized in anticancer activities.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Triazole-Based Ligand L
Reaction between ligand L and arene-Ru(II)-acceptors
(1–4) in methanol or nitromethane
resulted in [2 + 2] self-assembled macrocycles (Scheme 2). The 1H NMR spectra of metallomacrocycles 5–8 are provided in Figure 1. 1H NMR showed the [2 + 2] self-assembly
of Ru(II)-acceptor with ligand L. The [2 + 2] self-assemblies
of 7 and 8 were also confirmed in methanol
solution (see the Supporting Information). Mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) confirmed the formation of metallomacrocycles 5–8. The isotopic distributions of metallomacrocycle 5 at 512.8365 [5-4OTf]4+, of 6 at 766.7859 [6-3OTf]3+, of 7 at 800.1315 [7-3OTf]3+, and of 8 at 866.8110 [8-3OTf]3+ agreed with
theoretical values (see the Supporting Information).

Scheme 2 Coordination-Driven Self-Assembly of Metallomacocycles 5–8
Finally, [2 + 2] self-assembly of metallomacrocycle 8 was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies
(Figure 2). Suitable
crystals
of X-ray quality were obtained by the slowly diffusing diethyl ether
into a solution of metallomacrocycle metallomacrocycle 8 in nitromethane. Macrocycle 8 crystallized in monoclinic
space group P21/n. In crystal structure
of 8, anthracene moieties were displaced from the molecular
plane by steric effects. Although ligand L can adopt
two extreme (syn and anti) conformations, it adopted a pseudo-linear
(anti) conformation with two 4-pyridyl-1,2,3-triazole moieties opposite
each other. Crystallographic data and structure refinement parameters
are provided in Table S1.

Effects on Cancer Cell Growth
The cancer cell growth
inhibition test based on MTT-based assessments of mitochondrial activity
is mainly used for drug screening and cytotoxicity testing.26 We first assessed the cytotoxic potential of
compounds 5–8 by determining their
IC50 values in human cancer cells (Table 1). Metallomacrocycle 7 exhibited
good anticancer potentials in AGS, HCT-15, and HepG2 cells. In addition,
it was confirmed that the IC50 value in human normal cell
(HEK293) was 35.7 ± 0.70 μM, which was not toxic at the
experimental concentration.

Stabilities
of Metallomacrocycles 7 and 8 in Cell Culture Medium
Metallomacrocycles 7 and 8 were preincubated
in cell culture medium at 20 μM for 0, 24, 48, or 72 h at 37
°C. These samples (0–20 μM) were treated on the
cells for 24 h. The cell growth inhibition activities of metallomacrocycles 7 and 8 on HepG2 cells were determined by the
MTT assay. The cell growth inhibition activity of metallomacrocycle 7 was stable for 48 h and then declined slightly over the
next 24 h (Table 2).
The stability of AGS and HCT-15 cells decreased over time. Thus, further
studies were conducted using HepG2 cells.

8	7.1 ± 0.74	17.9 ± 0.74	>20	>20	
These results indicate that metallomacrocycle 7 is
stable in cell culture medium and strongly inhibited cancer cell growth.
Metallomacrocycle 8 stably inhibited cell growth for
24 h but failed to do so at 48 h. Accordingly, we conducted further
evaluation of the anticancer effect of metallomacrocycle 7. The stability in DMSO solution was also checked for macrocycles 7 and 8 by 1H NMR (see the Supporting Information). The stabilities of macrocycles 7 and 8 were determined in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS, pH 7.5) solution via UV–visible spectrophotometry.
Macrocycles 7 and 8 are stable enough in
PBS solution over 72 h as reveled by UV–visible spectra (see
the Supporting Information).

Apoptosis in
Metallomacrocycle 7-Treated HepG2 Cells
To determine whether
the cytotoxic effect of metallomacrocycle 7 in HepG2
cells was mediated by apoptosis, cells were treated
with metallomacrocycle 7 at concentrations from 0 to
10 μM for 24 h and DAPI staining was observed using a Tali image-based
cytometer. As shown in Figure 3, metallomacrocycle 7 markedly and concentration-dependently
induced apoptosis, suggesting that it is selectively cytotoxic to
cancer cells and that this is achieved by the induction of apoptotic
cell death.

Figure 3 Effect of metallomacrocycle 7 on apoptotic cell death.
Notes: Evaluation of apoptotic HepG2 cells. Apoptotic cells show green
fluorescence, necrotic cells show red and green fluorescence (observed
as yellow), and live cells show little or no fluorescence. Apoptosis

Metallomacrocycle 7-Induced
Caspase Activation and Modulated
Intrinsic Mitochondrial Apoptosis in HepG2 Cells
Apoptotic
cell death pathways include the extrinsic death receptor pathway and
the intrinsic mitochondria-mediated pathway.27 Caspase 8 (a marker of the extrinsic death receptor pathway), caspase
9 (a marker of the intrinsic mitochondria-mediated pathway) are “initiator”
caspases, whereas caspase 3 and caspase 7 are “effector”
caspases.28,29 To elucidate the molecular mechanism responsible
for metallomacrocycle 7-induced apoptosis, we examined
the expressions of apoptosis-related proteins, caspases, and poly
ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) in HepG2 cells. Western blotting was
used to measure caspase levels to evaluate the extrinsic apoptotic
response to metallomacrocycle 7. As shown in Figure 4, the expressions
of cleaved caspase 7 and caspase 3 were increased dose dependently
and metallomacrocycle 7 caused the activation of PARP,
as evidenced by a reduction in PARP and an accumulation of cleaved
PARP. To evaluate the effect of metallomacrocycle 7 on
the mitochondrial intrinsic pathway in HepG2 cells, we measured the
protein levels of Bcl-2 proteins (Bcl-2, Bax, and Bid) and p53 after
exposure to metallomacrocycle 7 at 0, 2.5, 5, and 10
μM. As shown in Figure 4B, the protein levels of Bax, Bid, and p53 decreased and Bcl-2
expression did not change after exposure, indicating that these might
not be the key molecules of metallomacrocycle 7-induced apoptosis.
These results confirm that metallomacrocycle 7 in HepG2 cells induces
apoptosis through the extrinsic pathway rather than the mitochondrial
intrinsic pathway through p53 and Bax.

cell death by metallomacrocycle 7. HepG2 cells were treated
with metallomacrocycle 7 at
0–10 μM for 24 h.

Metallomacrocycle 7-Induced Cell Cycle Arrest in HepG2 Cells
To clarify metallomacrocycle 7-induced inhibitory effects on HepG2
cell proliferation, the cell cycle phase distributions of HepG2 cells
were examined by the Tali image-based cytometer. Cell cycle regulation
provides an important means of inhibiting cancer growth,30 and the initiation and regulation of cell cycle
phases are achieved by complex signal transduction systems. In particular,
the cyclin A/Cdk2 complex controls cell cycle progression from S phase
to G2/M.31 In addition, Rao et al.’s
study showed that increasing p27 causes G1 arrest through inhibiting
the binding of CDK and cyclin E/A in p53-independent pathways.32Figure 5A shows that incubation of metallomacrocycle 7 with HepG2
cells for 24 h significantly reduced the DNA content and makes them
appear in the G0/G1 phase, which is an indicative
of apoptosis, with a consequent loss of cells in the G1 phase; 44% of cells were gated in G0/G1 phase.
To characterize metallomacrocycle 7-induced G0/G1 phase arrest, we investigated changes in the expressions
of cyclin and Cdk (Figure 5B). We found that metallomacrocycle 7 treatment
reduced cyclin A and E and Cdk 2, 4, and 6 expressions but increased
cyclin D1 expression. Furthermore, metallomacrocycle 7 dose-dependently increased the protein levels of p16 and p27 (a
tumor suppressor related to a variety of human cancers33−36 and a mediator of the activation of cyclin E/cyclin A-Cdk2 and,
thus, of progression to the G0/G1 phase,37,38 respectively).

Experimental Section
General
Details
4-Azidopyridine, 1,4-bis(ethynyl)anthracene,
and arene-ruthenium acceptors 1–4 were prepared according to literature procedures.39,401H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker
300 and 400 MHz spectrometers, respectively. 1H NMR chemical
shifts are reported relative to the residual protons of deuterated
CD3OD (3.31 ppm) and CD3NO2 (4.33
ppm). ESI-MS spectra of metallomacrocycles were recorded on a Synapt
G2 quadrupole time-of flight mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray
ion source (Waters, Milford, MA) and analyzed using the MassLynx software
suite system at the Korea Basic Science Institute (Ochang). Phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS, pH 7.5; Sigma-Aldrich) solution was used as received.
The sample for UV–vis absorption was prepared by dissolving
macrocycles with a minimum amount of CH3OH followed by
dilution with phosphate-buffered saline solution (18 μm, 25
mL). The spectra were recorded using a Varian Cary-100 UV–vis
spectrophotometer.

Single-Crystal X-ray Diffraction
Intensity data of
suitable crystals of 8 were collected at 100 K on an
ADSC Quantum 210 CCD diffractometer using synchrotron radiation (λ
= 0.70000 Å) at the Supramolecular Crystallography Beamline 2D,
Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL; Pohang, Korea). Raw data was integrated
and scaled using HKL3000. The structure of 8 was solved
using direct methods,and refinements were carried out by the full-matrix
least-squares method on F2 using appropriate
software implemented in the SHELXTL program package.41 Hydrogen atoms were added to their geometrically ideal
positions and were refined anisotropically. Most disordered solvent
molecules were removed from the diffraction data using the SQUEEZE
routine in PLATON software,42 and final
refinements were then conducted. X-ray crystallographic data is provided
in Table S1.

Cell Culture
AGS
(human gastric adenocarcinoma), HCT-15
(human colorectal carcinoma), A549 (human lung carcinoma), HepG2 (human
hepatocellular carcinoma), and HEK293 (human embryonic kidney cells)
cells lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC, Manassas, VA). A549, AGS, HCT-15 cells were cultured in RPMI
1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum
(FBS, Gibco) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S, Gibco). HepG2 cells
were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% P/S. HEK293 cells were cultured
in MEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% P/S, and 25 mM HEPES.
All cell lines were cultured in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37
°C. The human cell lines used were handled in accordance with
human cell line experimental guidelines.

Cancer Cell Growth Inhibition
Assay
Human cancer cells
were seeded into 96-well plates at ∼5 × 103 cells per well, incubated at 37 °C overnight, and then treated
with compounds dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, final concentration
0.4%) in a 5% CO2 atmosphere for 24 h at 37 °C. After
these treatments, cells were treated with 10 μL of MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide) solution in a 5% CO2 atmosphere for 4 h at 37
°C. The formazan formed was dissolved in 100 μL of DMSO,
and the absorbance was measured at 550 nm using a multireader (TECAN,
Switzerland). Half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were defined as the concentrations that inhibited cell viability
by 50%.

Tali Image-Based Cytometric Assay
Apoptosis was assessed
using a Tali image-based cytometer (Invitrogen), as previously described.43 HepG2 cells were seeded at 2 × 105 cells/mL in 6-well plates and 24 h later treated with different
concentrations of metallomacrocycle 7 (0–10 μM)
in a 5% CO2 atmosphere for 24 h at 37 °C. Cells were
harvested using the trypsin/EDTA (T/E, Gibco) reagent and stained
with the Tali apoptosis kit. Cells were stained with annexin V—Alexa
Fluor 488 conjugate to quantify apoptotic cells. Propidium iodide
(PI) was used to differentiate necrotic and apoptotic cells. Percentages
of live, apoptotic, and necrotic cells as determined using the Tali
cytometer were comparable with those obtained by flow cytometry.

Western Blot Assay
HepG2 cells (1 × 106 per
60 mm dish) were plated in dishes and allowed to attach for
24 h. After metallomacrocycle 7 treatment, cells were
washed with cold PBS, harvested, and cell pellets were lysed with
the protein extraction solution (iNtRON, Korea) on ice for 1 h. Proteins
were separated by centrifugation at 12 000 rpm for 10 min at
4 °C, and aliquots (40 μg) were separated by 12% sodium
dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE) electrophoresis and
then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad Laboratories
Inc., Hercules, CA). Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubating
membranes with 5% skim milk in TBST (10 nmol/L tris–HCl (pH
8.0), 150 mmol/L NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature
(rt). Membranes were then incubated with 1:1000 diluted primary antibodies
at 4 °C overnight, probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibodies (1:5000), and visualized by densitometry (ECL
system, Amersham, U.K.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Cell Cycle Analysis
Cell cycles were analyzed using
a Tali image-based cytometer according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. HepG2 cells were treated with metallomacrocycle 7 for 24 h. After harvesting, cells were slowly resuspended and incubated
overnight with 70% cold ethanol at −20 °C. Moreover, cells
were washed with PBS and stained with Tali cell cycle solution for
30 min in the dark. Cell cycles were analyzed using the Tali image-based
cytometer.

Statistical Analysis
Results are
presented as the means
± standard errors of means (SEM) of three independent experiments.
Statistical analysis was determined by one-way analysis of variance
followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons using GraphPad Prism
5.0 (GraphPad, San Diego, California) software. Statistical significance
was accepted for p values of <0.05.

Conclusions
We report the synthesis of click ligands incorporating
the 4-pyridyl-1,2,3-triazole
moiety and their coordination-driven self-assembly using arene-Ru(II)
acceptors to form cytotoxic metallomacrocycles 5–8. All of the compounds were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, ESI-MS, and elemental analysis, and the
molecular structure of macrocycle 8 was determined by
single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Metallomacrocycle 7 inhibited the growth of A549, AGS, HCT-15, and HepG2 more effectively
than doxorubicin, which suggests its potential use as the basis of
anticancer drug development. Metallomacrocycle 7 was
found to be cytotoxic to HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells,
and this is achieved by inducing apoptosis through activating the
extrinsic cell death pathway. Because high levels of p27 can cause
S phase arrest by preventing the activation of cyclin E/cdk2, we suggest
this might explain HepG2 cell cycle arrest in the S phase after metallomacrocycle 7 exposure. The cytotoxic properties of 3 originates
from the presence of 5,8-dihydroxy-1,4-napththoquinone44 with the arene-Ru(II) moiety, which is enhanced
in the metallomacrocycle 7 due to increased nuclearity
and the synergistic effect of the ligand containing an anthracene-attached
4-pyridyl-1,2,3-triazole moiety.
