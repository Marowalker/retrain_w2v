A significant
amount of research has been conducted on bentonite–acrylamide
hydrogels. These gels are usually prepared by uniformly mixing bentonite
with reactive monomers. Herein, a new preparation method of bentonite–acrylamide
hydrogels has been proposed to cater to one novel application of bentonite–acrylamide
hydrogels. In this method, bentonite–acrylamide hydrogel was
obtained by pressing bentonite into a thin mud cake and extruding
a mixed liquor of acrylamide, a cross-linking agent, an initiator,
and water into the thin mud cake and then subjecting the system to
water-bath curing. The effects of extrusion pressure, extrusion time,
and acrylamide concentration on the tensile strength and elemental
composition of bentonite–acrylamide hydrogel were investigated.
The results show that the tensile strength of the bentonite–acrylamide
hydrogel first increased and then tended to be stable with the further
increase in extrusion pressure and extrusion time. As the concentration
of acrylamide increased, the tensile strength of the bentonite–acrylamide
hydrogel increased first and then decreased slightly. With the increase
in extrusion pressure, extrusion time, and acrylamide concentration,
the contents of C and N elements in the thin mud cake gradually increased
and then tended to be stable, which reflects the state of the monomer
entering the thin mud cake. In addition, the elemental composition
of the bentonite–acrylamide hydrogel was analyzed via the scanning
electron microscopy–energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry method,
and it was found that the composition of the hydrogel was relatively
uniform in the direction of mixed liquor extrusion.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Hydrogels are typical
functional polymer materials, and their internal
three-dimensional network structure endows them with certain water
absorption ability, excellent water retention ability, and a certain
strength and water swelling capacity. Therefore, after being successfully
developed in the 1960s, they have been widely used in various industries
such as chemical, health, medicine, building materials, oil and gas
field development, agriculture, and forestry.1−5

In particular, hydrogels are widely used in
oil and gas field development.
Herein, hydrogels are used as profile control and water shutoff agents
to adjust the flow direction of the flooding water and drive more
crude out to enhance oil recovery.6 They
can also be used as a temporary plugging fluid to prevent the workover
fluid in the well bore from leaking into the stratum during the workover
process.7−12 The hydrogel can be used as an annulus sealant. In the production
process of oil and gas wells, after an interlayer cross flow is formed
in the annulus by the crack of the annulus cement ring, the hydrogel
is squeezed into the channel to prevent the fluid flow from high-pressure
formation to low-pressure formation through the channel. The field
applications indicate that the effective period of hydrogel sealing
annular channeling is at least 2 years.13,14

This
paper proposes a novel application of hydrogels in improving
the sealing of cement sheath in oil and gas wells. The process of
oil and gas well cementing operation is to insert a casing into the
oil and gas well after drilling the oil and gas well hole and filling
the cement slurry between the casing and the well wall.15 The oil and gas well cementing operation is
aimed at sealing the stratum of different pressures by pumping cement
slurry into the annulus between the casing and the stratum to prevent
fluids in the high-pressure stratum from flowing into the low-pressure
stratum through the well bore. The drilling fluid used in the drilling
process contains much bentonite; after the oil and gas well cementing
operation, a mud cake with a thickness of 2–5 mm often exists
between the cement sheath and the wall of the oil well, wherein, the
primary component of the mud cake is bentonite.16,17 During the production of the oil and gas well, the mud cake gradually
disappears due to dissolution and erosion of stratum water. After
the mud cake disappears, the sealing ability of the cement sheath
is seriously weakened.18 To prevent the
erosion of the mud cake and ensuring the sealing ability of the cement
sheath, the researchers have applied some measures to solidify the
mud cake to a certain extent. However, the strength of the formed
solidified mud cake is very low and easy to crack in the later production
process, thereby forming a hydrocarbon channel.19 As bentonite can be used as a reaction raw material to
enhance the performance of hydrogels,20−23 this paper proposes a technique
of transforming the mud cake into hydrogels. Before the cementing
operation, the active liquid containing the reaction monomer, cross-linking
agent, and initiator is pumped into the well bore where the mud cake
is present. Owing to pressure difference, the active liquid is squeezed
into the mud cake of the well wall and then the cement slurry is pumped.
At ambient temperature of the well and after a certain period of time,
a bentonite-containing hydrogel is formed by the reaction of the reaction
monomer, cross-linking agent, and initiator with bentonite in the
mud cake. The formed hydrogel is expected to have a good annulus sealing
ability in a downhole environment.

Conventional hydrogels are
formed by evenly mixing the raw materials,
whereas the hydrogels in this paper were prepared via a two-step process
(as shown in the Figure 1). In the first step, part of the reaction raw material (bentonite
slurry) is pressed into a mud cake under a pressure difference. The
second step is to press the remaining reaction materials (reactive
monomer, cross-linking agent, initiator, water, etc.) into the mud
cake and then curing at a predetermined temperature to form the gel.
The hydrogel formation method in the paper is significantly different
from the conventional hydrogel formation method. When the monomer,
cross-linking agent, and initiator are determined, the properties
of the hydrogel formed by our proposed method are related to the amount
of the reactive monomer, the cross-linking agent, and the initiator
in the mud cake. Due to the low permeability of the formed mud cake,
which usually does not exceed 2 × 10–9 Darcy,24 the aqueous solution containing the monomer,
cross-linking agent, and initiator requires sufficient extrusion pressure
and extrusion time to enter the mud cake.

Figure 1 Flow diagram of the preparation
of the bentonite–acrylamide
hydrogel by the nonmixing method.

Therefore, the effects of extrusion pressure and extrusion time
on the properties of the pie bentonite–acrylamide hydrogel
were investigated. Also, the elemental analysis of the bentonite–acrylamide
hydrogel was carried out to determine the mechanism of the influence
of extrusion pressure and extrusion time on the properties of the
hydrogels. The research has a definite significance in expanding the
application field and preparation methods of hydrogels.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Effects of Extrusion Parameters
on Hydrogel
Properties
To explore the effects of the extrusion parameters
on gel properties, the effects of extrusion pressure and extrusion
time on the tensile strength and elastic modulus of the hydrogel were
investigated. The extrusion pressure levels in the study were 0.75,
1.5, and 3 MPa, respectively, whereas the extrusion time levels were
10, 30, 45, 60, and 90 min. The experimental results are shown in Figures 2 and 3.

Figure 2 Effect of extrusion time on the tensile strength of the hydrogel.

Figure 3 Effect of extrusion time on the elastic modulus of the
hydrogel.

As shown in Figure 2, when the extrusion pressures were 0.75,
1.5, and 3 MPa, the tensile
strength of the hydrogel gradually increased as the extrusion time
increased from 10 to 60 min. After the extrusion time exceeded 60
min, the tensile strength of the hydrogel did not change significantly.
In addition, the same effect of extrusion time and extrusion pressure
on the elastic modulus is observed in Figure 3. The increase in the tensile strength and
elastic modulus of the hydrogel was primarily caused by the increase
in the effective content of the reaction materials in the mud cake
and the increasingly denser network structure inside the hydrogel
with the increase in extrusion time.

To understand the rule
of reaction materials entering the mud cake
with the increase in extrusion time, elemental analysis was performed
on the hydrogels formed at different extrusion times, as shown in Figures 4–6. The contents of C element and
N element increased first and changed slightly after 60 min as the
extrusion times increased.

Figure 4 Mass fractions of the C element in the hydrogel
at different extrusion
times.

Figure 5 Mass fractions of the N element in the hydrogel
at different extrusion
times.

Figure 6 Molar ratios of C/N in the hydrogel at different
extrusion times.

By comparing the change
in the content of C and N and the tensile
strength of hydrogel with time, it can be seen that the change in
tensile strength of the hydrogel has a strong consistency with the
change in the contents of C and N. In addition, as shown in Figure 6, the molar ratios
of C/N were basically about 3, which is in good agreement with acrylamide
(molecular formula: C3H5NO).

The effect
of extrusion pressure on the tensile strength of the
hydrogel can be observed in Figure 2. In summary, the extrusion pressure had no significant
effect on the tensile strength of the hydrogel. As the extrusion pressure
is relatively difficult to control in the site operation, a low sensitivity
to the extrusion pressure is conducive for on-site construction. The
extrusion pressure had no significant effect on the content of the
C element and the N element in the hydrogel (see Figures 4 and 5). However, when the extrusion pressure was 0.75 MPa, the contents
of the C element and the N element in the hydrogel were slightly higher
than those at the extrusion pressures of 1.5 and 3 MPa. This may be
because the mud cake became denser at the extrusion pressures of 1.5
and 3 MPa, and thus, it became more difficult for the solution containing
the reaction raw material to enter the mud cake. Comparing the change
in C element and N element and the change of hydrogel tensile strength
with the extrusion pressure, there was no clear correlation between
the tensile strength of the hydrogel and the content of C and N. This
may be because the content differences of C and N elements were not
clear under different extrusion pressures.

2.2 Effect
of the Concentration of Reaction Raw
Materials on the Hydrogel
To understand the effect of concentration
of reaction raw material on the hydrogel, the effect of concentrations
of different reaction raw materials on the tensile strength of the
hydrogel was studied. The specific concentration level of reaction
raw materials is presented in Table 1. In this section, the extrusion pressure was 1.5 MPa
and the extrusion time was 90 min. The tensile strengths of the hydrogel
at different concentrations of the acrylamide monomer are shown in Figure 7.

Figure 7 Tensile strength of the
hydrogel at different acrylamide concentrations.

Table 1 Ingredients of an Aqueous Solution
of the Reaction Raw Materials
sample	AM/% (BWOW)	MBA/% (BWOW)	ammonium persulfate/% (BWOW)	
1	10	0.3	0.04	
2	20	0.6	0.08	
3	30	0.9	0.12	
4	40	1.2	0.16	
As shown
in Figure 7, when the
acrylamide concentrations were 10 and 20%, no gelation
reactions occurred; thus, the tensile strength of the gel was zero.
As the acrylamide concentration exceeded 25%, the tensile strength
of the gel could surpass 0.243 MPa. The gel had the highest tensile
strength at the acrylamide concentration of 30%. As the acrylamide
concentration further increased above 35%, the tensile strength of
the hydrogel decreased to a certain extent. To determine the effect
of acrylamide concentration on the tensile strength, the mass fractions
of C and N in the hydrogel at different acrylamide concentrations
were analyzed using an elemental analyzer. As shown in Figure 8, with an increase in the acrylamide
monomer, the mass fractions of C and N elements presented a trend
of gradual increase. When the concentrations of acrylamide were 10
and 20%, the low concentrations of the reaction raw material in the
mud cake might be the reason for no polymerization reaction. When
the concentration of acrylamide was more than 25%, the reaction material
concentration in the mud cake was high enough to undergo polymerization
reaction, thus forming a hydrogel. With a further increase in the
acrylamide concentration above 35%, the excessive content of cross-linking
agent in the mud cake and excessive cross-linking point might have
led to a certain decrease in the tensile strength of the hydrogel.25

acrylamide
concentrations.

2.3 Microstructure
Characterization of the Hydrogel
The samples of bentonite,
AM, MBA, hydrogel without initiator,
and hydrogel with initiator were analyzed by infrared spectra. The
results are shown in Figure 9. The characteristic peak of C=C obtained from the
samples of AM, MBA, and hydrogel without initiator appeared at 1614
cm–1. The characteristic peak of C=C disappeared
in the sample of hydrogel with initiator which attributes to the polymerization
reaction of AM or AM and MBA. The peak at 3626 cm–1 was attributed to the hydroxyl of the bentonite, and it disappeared
in the sample of hydrogel with initiator.26 The peaks of primary amine of AM and secondary amine of MBA could
be found at 3345 and 3300 cm–1 respectively, and
they could not be found in the hydrogel with or without initiator,
which may be attributed to the combination with bentonite.5,27

Figure 9 FTIR

MBA, and bentonite.

As the hydrogels prepared
in this paper were not prepared by uniform
mixing but rather by first preparing the clay mud cake and then squeezing
the monomers, initiator, and other materials, the hydrogels prepared
by this method may not be homogeneous in the longitudinal direction.
Therefore, the elemental composition in the longitudinal direction
of the gel was investigated via scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS). To characterize the
change in the longitudinal composition of the hydrogel, three rectangular
regions of 1, 2, and 3 were sequentially selected from the top to
the bottom of the hydrogel. The elemental compositions of the three
regions are displayed in Figure 10a. There was no significant difference in the elemental
composition of the three regions (see Figure 10), indicating that there was no significant
difference in the longitudinal direction of the formed hydrogel. After
the resolution being increased as shown in Figure 10b,c, no pore existed in the hydrogel but
wrinkles could be found on the surface, which may be generated by
extrusion during squeezing of the active materials. Figure 11 shows the TEM image of the
hydrogel, wherein the distribution of bentonite is relatively uniform.

3 Conclusions
A novel preparation method for bentonite–acrylamide hydrogels
has been proposed in this paper. Bentonite–acrylamide hydrogels
were obtained by first pressing the mixture of bentonite and water
into a thin mud cake using the drilling fluid high-temperature and
high-pressure water loss meter, extruding a mixture of water, acrylamide,
a cross-linking agent, and an initiator into the thin mud cake and
then subjecting it to water-bath curing. The effects of various factors
on the properties of the novel bentonite–acrylamide hydrogels
were studied, and the hydrogels were characterized by elemental analysis
and SEM–EDS. The following conclusions are drawn:(1) With the increase
in extrusion pressure
and extrusion time, the tensile strength and elastic modulus of the
bentonite–acrylamide hydrogel increased first and then tended
to be stable. In combination with the elemental analysis, this may
be because, with the extension of extrusion pressure and extrusion
time, the entering of effective components such as reactive monomers
in the clay mud cake was gradually increased.

(2) As the concentration of acrylamide
increased, the tensile strength of the bentonite–acrylamide
hydrogel increased first and then decreased slightly. The gel had
the highest tensile strength at the acrylamide concentration of 30%.
The increase in the tensile strength of the bentonite–acrylamide
hydrogel was due to the increase in the concentration of the acrylamide
reaction monomer. The late reduction of tensile strength of the bentonite–acrylamide
hydrogel may be because as the concentration of acrylamide and the
content of the cross-linking agent increased, the excessively formed
cross-linking points led to a decrease in the tensile strength.

(3) The elemental composition
of the bentonite–acrylamide
hydrogel in the longitudinal direction was analyzed via the SEM–EDS
method, and it was found that the components of the hydrogel were
relatively uniform in the longitudinal direction. Moreover, there
was a large amount of reaction monomers at the end of solution injection
and few reaction monomers at the end of solution flow did not occur.
In addition, the TEM image shows that the distribution of bentonite
in the hydrogel is relatively uniform.



4 Experiments
4.1 Materials
Sodium
bentonite (industrial
grade, Weifang Huajing Bentonite Co., Ltd.) was the clay used to prepare
the mud cake. Acrylamide (AM), N,N-methylenebisacrylamide (MBA), sodium hydroxide, ammonium persulfate,
and sodium carbonate were all of analytical grade and purchased from
Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.

4.2 Preparation
of the Pie Bentonite–Acrylamide
Hydrogel by the Nonmixing Method
4.2.1 Preparation
of the Mud Cake
A certain
amount of bentonite and water were poured into a slurry cup in a high-speed
mixer, stirred at 10 000 rpm for 20 min and then hydrated at
room temperature for 24 h. Then, 200 mL of clay slurry was poured
into a GGS42-2A drilling fluid high-temperature and high-pressure
water loss meter (manufactured by Qingdao Chuangmeng Instrument Co.,
Ltd.) and filtered at a pressure difference of 0.75 MPa for 90 min,
forming a mud cake in the process.

4.2.2 Preparation
of the Pie Bentonite–Acrylamide
Hydrogel
Acrylamide, N,N-methylenebisacrylamide, and ammonium persulfate were added to distilled
water in a certain ratio and stirred at high speed for 15 min to prepare
a reaction solution.

The composition of the reaction solution
was: distilled water 100% (by weight on water, BWOW) + acrylamide
30% (BWOW) + N,N-methylenebisacrylamide
0.9% (BWOW) + ammonium persulfate 0.12% (BWOW). After the mud cake
was prepared, the excess clay slurry in the water loss meter cup was
poured out and the integrity of the mud cake should be ensured. Then,
the prepared reaction solution was reintroduced into the slurry cup
with the mud cake. Using high-pressure nitrogen, the reaction solution
was extruded into the mud cake at the predetermined extrusion pressure
and extrusion time. After the extrusion of the reaction solution was
complete, the excess reaction solution was poured out of the slurry
cup. Finally, the mud cake with the reaction solution was taken out
(as shown in Figure 12), sealed in a sealing bag, and placed in a water bath at 55 °C
for 5 h to prepare the bentonite–acrylamide hydrogel (as shown
in the Figures 13 and 14).

4.3 Mechanical Properties of the Hydrogel
The obtained pie hydrogel was cut into a strip of 22 mm in length
and 6 mm in width. The maximum tensile force at break was measured
by a ZQ-990A electric tensile testing machine (range: 2000 N, resolution:
0.01 N) produced by Dongguan Zhicai Precision Instrument Co., Ltd.
The maximum tensile force at break was divided by the cross-sectional
area of its original end face to obtain tensile strength, and the
slope of the stress–strain plot formed when the tensile strength
was tested was the modulus of the hydrogel.

4.4 Elemental
Analysis of the Hydrogel
To understand the composition of
the pie hydrogel under different
extrusion times and pressures, the organic elements in the hydrogel
were analyzed using a Vario ELIII CHNS/O elemental analyzer manufactured
by Elementar, Germany. To eliminate the interference of the organic
elements in the clay on the test results, the content of organic elements
in the clay were first tested and then the contents of organic elements
in the bentonite–acrylamide hydrogel at different extrusion
pressures and different extrusion times were tested. The difference
of the organic element content after and before the extrusion of the
reaction materials was the increase in the organic elements in the
mud cake due to the introduction of reactive monomers and cross-linking
agents under the action of extrusion.

4.5 Fourier
Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectra
of the Hydrogel
To understand the changing situation of the
reactive materials, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the
samples were recorded using a Thermo Fisher Nicolet 6700 FTIR spectrophotometer.
The samples used to do FTIR analysis contains bentonite, AM, MBA,
hydrogel without initiator, and hydrogel with initiator. Hydrogel
without initiator means when the hydrogel was made, AM, MBA, and bentonite,
except ammonium persulfate were included in the reaction materials.

4.6 SEM and EDS Analysis of the Hydrogel
To
further understand the structural characteristics of the pie bentonite–acrylamide
hydrogel formed by the nonmixing method, a Japanese Hitachi S-4800
scanning electron microscope combined with an EDAX XM2-60S spectrometer
was used to analyze the elemental distribution in three regions (plane
1, plane 2, and plane 3) in the longitudinal section of the hydrogel
(see Figure 15).
