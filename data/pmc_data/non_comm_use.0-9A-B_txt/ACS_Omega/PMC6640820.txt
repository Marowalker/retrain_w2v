A deep-blue-emitting
sultam-based hetero[5]helicene was synthesized
in four steps, and its crystal structure and physical properties were
characterized. The helicene displays more than two-fold crystallization-induced
emission enhancement as well as atypical blue-shifting of its solid-state
emission relative to the solution phase. This rapid synthesis of an
unusual sulfonamide-based helicene fluorophore is expected to generate
new molecular design options that will help address the ongoing challenges
associated with designing pure-blue emitters for organic optoelectronic
and sensing applications.

Introduction
Efficient luminescent
organic materials show great promise for
applications such as chemosensors, bioprobes, and solid-state lighting
technology, for example, organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs).1 Currently, there is much ongoing effort to develop
organic materials that emit blue and deep-blue light, as opposed to
sky-blue or blue-green. Compared with red and green organic luminogens,
standard blue and deep-blue emitters are even more challenging to
realize due to stability issues and the intrinsically wide bandgaps
that are required.2 To address this, recent
research has sought to design new organic materials that are efficient
and stable blue emitters.3 Molecular design
strategies have explored the use of anthracene,4 fluorene,5 polyphenylbenzene,6 pyrene,7 and carbazole-based8 π-systems to generate the requisite large
bandgaps for deep-blue emission. Regardless of the specific π-system,
one issue that poses a constant challenge is that of aggregation-caused
quenching (ACQ).9 With most π-conjugated
luminophores, aggregation due to π–π stacking often
results in red-shifted emissions10 and
a marked decrease in photoluminescence (PL) intensity.11 Thus, a luminogen that is blue-emitting in solution
might show undesirable blue-green emission and/or low PL efficiency
in the solid state. This is a major problem for OLEDs, where organic
emitters are employed as solid films. A possible solution lies in
blue emitters that exhibit aggregation-induced emission (AIE) or crystallization-induced
emission enhancement (CIEE) instead of ACQ. AIE, a property coined
and studied extensively by Tang et al.,12 describes luminogens that emit strongly as aggregates due to restricted
intramolecular rotations (RIRs). CIEE,13 a related but less common phenomenon, also avoids ACQ and allows
a luminogen to emit more strongly in the solid than in solution. A
subset of AIE is aggregation-induced blue-shifted emission (AIBSE),
an intriguing property seen in some organic systems.14 Compounds exhibiting AIBSE not only remain emissive in
the solid phase, but also display blue-shifted instead of red-shifted
emissions relative to solution. In this way, the desirable pure-blue
emission is preserved. Although the underlying mechanism of AIBSE
remains unclear, Shuai and co-workers propose that it stems from the
smaller reorganization energies in aggregates versus solution phase,
as a consequence of restricted geometric relaxation, excited-state
planarization, and the freezing of low-frequency out-of-plane vibrations.15 As research into the microscopic origin of AIBSE
continues, better defined structure–property relationships
will be established to guide the rational design of future organic
“AIBSEgens”. Considering the theoretical and technological
implications, it is important to develop new AIE- and CIEE-active
materials that retain high-intensity pure-blue emissions in the solid
state. Herein, we report the four-step synthesis of a sulfonamide-based
hetero[5]helicene 4 showing deep-blue emission in solution
and solid phase, as well as CIEE- and AIBSE-like properties in the
crystalline state.

Results and Discussion
The structure
of 4 is a polycyclic aromatic π-framework
composed of three benzene rings and two sultam rings fused together
(Figure 1). As is the
case with [n]helicenes, intramolecular steric repulsion gives rise
to a torsion angle that reduces conjugation and widens the bandgap.
Using DFT calculations at the M06-2X/6-311G(d,p) level of theory,
we calculated the racemization barrier of 4 to be 20.08
kcal/mol at 298 K. With helicene 4, the incorporation
of two sulfonamide moieties into the rigid framework was expected
to further increase the torsion angle by virtue of the larger third-row
element (sulfur) and the nitrogen atom with partial sp3 character. The S–N bridges, which possess double bond character,16 also serve to rigidify the system and further
restrict intramolecular rotations. Although they have been ubiquitous
in medicinal chemistry for decades, sulfonamide functional groups
in the context of organic optoelectronic materials are still extremely
rare.

Figure 1 Structure of blue-emitting hetero[5]helicene 4.

To prepare helicene 4, we began the synthesis (Scheme 1) with the cheaply
available phenylene-1,4-diamine. The diamine was refluxed with two
equivalents of 2-nitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride in the presence of
pyridine for 2 h to generate bis-sulfonamide 1 in 82%
isolated yield. In the second step, the nitro groups were reduced
with stannous chloride to afford two aniline moieties that are poised
for a double Pschorr cyclization. This key step was achieved by first
diazotizing the pair of primary amines with isoamyl nitrite, followed
by diradical generation via one-electron reduction with aqueous potassium
ferrocyanide, and finally double-ring closure to give the unsubstituted
hetero[5]helicene 3 as one of the major products. The
double cyclization is not regioselective, in that the nonhelical hetero[5]phenacene
is obtained as the other main product when the second cyclization
occurs para instead of ortho to the first newly formed C–C
bond. Owing to its less planar structure, hetero[5]helicene 3 was significantly more soluble in organic solvents than
the hetero[5]phenacene regioisomer, thus allowing for facile separation.
Complete purification of 3 was achieved using standard
silica gel column chromatography. In the last step, 3 underwent double N-methylation to yield 4. The higher
acidity of the sulfonamide NH compared to that of amides allows for
facile N-functionalization under more mildly basic conditions. Hence,
the unsubstituted helicene 3 can serve as a readily accessible
precursor to a wide range of functional hetero[5]helicenes, where
different side chain modifiers can be introduced by N-functionalization,
thus allowing for the facile fine tuning of materials properties.
Upon obtaining N,N′-dimethyl
hetero[5]helicene 4, its molecular structure was unambiguously
confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR, electrospray ionization
mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), and single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies.
To assess the thermal stability of hetero[5]helicene 4, we carried out thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the solid under
nitrogen (Figure S12). Compound 4 was found to be thermally robust with its high thermal decomposition
temperature of 300.8 °C (i.e., Td, corresponding to 5% weight loss). Good thermal stability is important
for optoelectronic applications, as the material must withstand the
resistive heating that occurs in organic electronic devices (e.g.,
OLEDs),17 as well as the temperatures used
in the vacuum sublimation stage of device fabrication.

Scheme 1 Synthesis
of Sultam-Based Hetero[5]helicene 4
From the single-crystal structure, racemic hetero[5]helicene 4 is observed to form orthorhombic crystals of the space group Pbca with a = 18.9965(18) Å, b = 8.9214(9) Å, c = 22.156(2) Å,
α = β = γ = 90°. The molecules are seen to
pack in a herringbone-type arrangement with no significant π–π
stacking interactions (Figure 2b). The intermolecular edge-to-face distance was measured
to be 3.540 Å, and the herringbone slip angle was found to be
47.44°. The lack of face-to-face π–π stacking
was expected, given the nonplanar nature of the hetero[5]helicene.
Indeed, the single-crystal structure revealed a torsion angle of 20.8°,
which precludes efficient π-stacking and incidentally widens
the electronic bandgap. This is significant because eliminating strong
π–π interactions in the solid state is key in preventing
the formation of H-aggregates and excimers,9 many of which show ACQ that result in diminished or zero emission.
The single-crystal structure also revealed numerous short intermolecular
interactions, such as C–H···π and C–H···O
hydrogen-bonding interactions (Figure 2c). Specifically, there exist several aromatic C–H···π
interactions with atom-to-centroid distances measuring 3.540 Å,
and shorter (2.706 Å) aliphatic C–H···π
interactions between the methyl protons and outer benzene rings of
the fused polycyclic π-system. In addition, short intermolecular
C–H···O interactions between aromatic protons
and sulfonamide oxygen atoms were also observed, with distances measuring
2.291 and 2.580 Å. The multitude of short-range interactions
between the hetero[5]helicene molecules in the solid state likely
helps in restricting intramolecular motion and rotations.

crystal-packing structure showing short-range intermolecular C–H···π
and hydrogen-bonding interactions.

To characterize the photophysical properties of hetero[5]helicene 4, we carried out UV–vis and fluorescence studies in
the solution phase and solid state. In dilute dichloromethane (DCM)
solution, 4 showed major absorption peaks at 316 and
350 nm (shoulder), a deep-blue fluorescence emission band at 443 nm
(Figure 3a), and a
fluorescence lifetime of 1.565 ns. In comparison, the unsubstituted
precursor, helicene 3, showed violet emission with a
peak at 425 nm (Figure 3b). In the solid state, peak absorption of 4 was observed
at 390 nm, and notably, the fluorescence band appeared at 432 nm.
This hypsochromic shift of the solid-state emission relative to the
solution emission is characteristic of the unusual AIBSE phenomenon.

(DCM) and solid-state UV–vis absorbance and
PL spectra of hetero[5]helicene 4. (b) Comparison of
the solution UV–vis absorption and PL of the hetero[5]helicenes 3 (unsubstituted) and 4 (dimethylated).

In their theoretical study,15 Shuai
and co-workers proposed an explanation for AIBSE using an adiabatic
potential-energy surface model. The emission energy (Eem) is given as the difference between the absorption
energy (Eab) and the total reorganization
energy (λ) 1  Going from the aggregated state (agg) to the
solution (sol) phase, the shift in emission is thus simply given by 2  In conventional organic fluorophores where
the aggregate emission is red-shifted with respect to the solution,
the ΔEagg-sol term is <0.
As highlighted by Shuai’s group, it is possible to obtain AIBSE
(i.e., ΔEemagg-sol > 0) in aggregates if the
absorption
shift going from solution to aggregate is relatively small while the
λsol-agg term (corresponding to the Stokes
shift) in eq 2 is large.
In our present system, this was indeed observed experimentally. In
dilute solution, hetero[5]helicene 4 shows a large Stokes
shift of almost 100 nm, whereas the corresponding value in the solid
state is only about 40 nm. This gives rise to a large positive λsol-agg term. At the same time, the difference between
absorption peak values in solution (350 nm) versus solid state (390
nm) is not very large, that is, the ΔEabagg-sol term
is small. The net result is that the emission (443 nm) of the solution
phase is blue-shifted (to 432 nm) in the solid. The absence of red-shift
in the solid-state PL allows the deep-blue emission to be preserved.
At the molecular level, this AIBSE behavior in 4 is likely
due to the aforementioned lack of π-stacking and RIR in the
solid state. Although there are no significant intermolecular π–π
interactions within the crystalline phase of 4, collectively
there exist a multitude of intermolecular C–H···π
and C–H···O interactions of short contact distances
(Figure 2c) to help
stabilize crystal packing and restrict intramolecular rotational motions,
leading to blue-shifted and enhanced emission. By virtue of the rigid
and fused nature of the hetero[5]helicene π-system, as well
as the numerous short-range intermolecular interactions in the crystalline
state, the blue-shifted emission most likely results from restricted
geometric change and smaller reorganization energies15 in the solid compared to the solution phase. In addition
to blue-shifted emission, helicene 4 also displayed remarkable
CIEE, in that the PL efficiency of the crystals was twice as high
as the solution. The fluorescence quantum yield (Φf) of 4 in DCM was measured to be 13%, whereas single
crystals and ground crystals had Φf values of 22
and 28%, respectively (cf. the solid-state PL efficiencies of the
OLED polymers, PPV and MEH-PPV, are 27 and 15%,18 respectively). With 4, we attribute the higher
PL efficiency of milled versus pristine crystals to the suppression
of reabsorption effects, as described by Katoh et al.19

With regard to the optical bandgap of 4, the highest
occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)–lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital (LUMO) gap was estimated from its UV–vis absorption
edge using the Tauc method and was found to be approximately 3.1 eV,
typical of a wide-bandgap semiconductor. In comparison, the theoretical
HOMO–LUMO gap that we obtained through density functional theory
(DFT) calculations using the B3LYP/6-311G(d) method was 3.87 eV. The
HOMO and LUMO energy levels were calculated to be −6.15 and
−2.28 eV, respectively, in vacuum (Figure 4), which agreed with the electrochemically
determined values within 0.4 eV (see cyclic voltammetry data in the Supporting Information). We also performed calculations
to ascertain the fluorescence emission energies (solventless) of dialkylated
and diacylated derivatives of our sultam-based helicene core (see
the Supporting Information). The N-alkylated
derivatives were found to have fluorescence emission energies of 3.04
eV (407 nm) in vacuum (vs 414 nm in DCM), whereas the N-acylated analogues
showed higher calculated emission energies of 3.38 V (367 nm) in vacuum
(vs 360 nm in DCM). These computational results suggest that it could
be interesting to initiate future investigations into various acyl
derivatives to determine whether the reported [5]helicene core is
promising as a common platform for even wider bandgap materials that
emit in the violet or near-UV regions. Efficient and stable blue-violet20 and UV21 organic
emitters are also materials of current interest, and the ease with
which the bandgap of our sultam-based core can be tuned, based on
N-substituent choice, holds promise for further future investigations
into the modular design and synthesis of novel blue-to-UV emitters.

Conclusions
In summary, we have designed and synthesized
a novel sultam-based
hetero[5]helicene with intriguing optoelectronic properties. Helicene 4 displays deep-blue emission in solution and in the solid
state. Upon crystallization, the PL efficiency does not suffer from
ACQ effects, but is instead enhanced two-fold. In addition to CIEE,
the solid-state emission is also atypically blue-shifted relative
to the solution emission, thus preserving the desirable deep-blue
wavelength. TG studies also highlighted the excellent thermal stability
of 4, whereas DFT calculations showed that the bandgap
of the hetero[5]helicene core could be easily tuned. We believe that
these properties will make this sultam-based helicene motif a very
promising paradigm for designing next-generation pure-blue emitters,
especially considering the fact that sulfonamides remain highly underutilized
in organic electronics.

Experimental Section
Materials and Methods
For the synthesis of compounds,
all reactions requiring anhydrous conditions were carried out in oven-dried
glassware under dry nitrogen using standard Schlenk techniques. All
reagents and chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or Fisher
and used without further purification. Reaction solvents were dried
over activated 3 Å molecular sieves. Crude products were purified
by flash column chromatography on silica gel 60–230 mesh. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker
AVANCE II 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. ESI-MS spectra were recorded on
a Micromass, Q-Tof-2 mass spectrometer. UV–vis spectra were
recorded on a Scandrop MBI spectrophotometer, using a quartz cuvette
(1 cm path length) and AR grade DCM as the solvent. PL spectra were
recorded on a Photon Technology International (PTI) spectrofluorometer
equipped with an LPS-220B lamp power supply (PTI) and a PTI 814-Detector
system. Diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were obtained using a Varian
Cary 100 UV–vis spectrophotometer, equipped with a diffuse
reflectance accessory consisting of a 73-mm diameter integrating sphere.
Solid-state fluorescence studies were performed using a PerkinElmer
Luminescence Spectrometer LS 50 instrument, and solid-state quantum
efficiencies were determined by the integrating sphere technique using
a quanta-φ F-3029 sample chamber of the Horiba Scientific Fluorolog-3
spectrofluorometer equipped with an integrating sphere of diameter
15.2 cm coated with Spectralon material. TGA data were recorded on
a Q5000 IR instrument (TA Instruments; New Castle, DE), and the sample
was heated from 25 to 500 °C with a temperature rise of 10 °C/min
under nitrogen flow (120 mL/min). TGA data were analyzed using TA
Instruments Universal Analysis 2000 Version 4.5 A. Cyclic voltammetry
(CV) studies were carried out on a PARSTAT 2273 electrochemical workstation
with a conventional three-electrode configuration consisting of a
platinum wire working electrode, a platinum mesh counter electrode,
and a silver wire pseudo-reference electrode. The experiments were
performed at room temperature using 5 × 10–4 M solutions of analyte in HPLC-grade acetonitrile with 0.1 M tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6)
as the supporting electrolyte. Deoxygenation of the solutions was
achieved by sparging with nitrogen for 30 min, and the working electrode
was cleaned after each run. The cyclic voltammograms were recorded
using a scan rate of 100 mV s–1. Potentials measured
with reference to the Ag electrode were converted to values vs. the
saturated calomel electrode (SCE) by means of a ferrocenium/ferrocene
(Fc+/Fc) internal standard.

Bis-sulfonamide 1 was prepared
under sulfonamide synthesis conditions described in the literature.
Phenylene-1,4-diamine (2.00 g, 18.5 mmol) and 2-nitrobenzenesulfonyl
chloride (8.20 g, 37.0 mmol) were added to pyridine (19 mL) in a flask,
and the mixture was stirred under reflux at 110 °C for 2 h. The
reaction mixture was then cooled to room temperature and treated with
ice-cold water. The suspension was then filtered, and the precipitate
thus obtained was washed successively with water, hot methanol, and
diethyl ether to afford the product as a tan-colored solid (yield:
7.79 g, 88%); mp 261–263 °C. The product was analyzed
by 1H and 13C NMR (see the Supporting Information for NMR spectra of all compounds),
compared against literature values, and used directly in the next
step.

(2)
To a suspension of compound 1 (5.00 g, 10.5 mmol) in 50 mL of isopropanol at 55 °C was added
stannous chloride dihydrate (20.0 g, 88.6 mmol) in a portion-wise
manner. Then, 36% hydrochloric acid (18 mL) was added dropwise using
a dropping funnel over the course of 30 min. The entire mixture was
then heated with stirring at 60 °C for 3 h. The reaction mixture
was then cooled to room temperature and subsequently immersed in an
ice bath. The resulting precipitates were filtered and then washed
successively with water, methanol, and diethyl ether to yield the
diamine as a tan-colored powder (yield: 3.81 g, 87%); mp 253–254
°C. The product was analyzed by 1H and 13C NMR, compared against published values, and used directly in the
next step.

Compound 2 (0.0500 g, 0.119 mmol)
was dissolved in acetone (7 mL) and H2SO4 (0.026
mL, 0.48 mmol) was added dropwise at 0 °C followed by isoamyl
nitrite (0.064 mL, 0.48 mmol). The mixture was stirred for 1 h, and
then water was added until the solution became homogeneous. After
1 h, potassium ferrocyanide trihydrate (0.252 g, 0.598 mmol) dissolved
in deionized water (18 mL) was added dropwise to the above reaction
mixture. The reaction was then stirred for an additional 4 h, after
which it was cooled in an ice bath and filtered. The precipitate was
washed with cold water and then air-dried. The crude product was subsequently
chromatographed on a silica gel column, to afford 3 as
a white powder (yield: 0.010 g, 22%); mp 342–344 °C. 1H NMR (400 MHz, MeOD): δ (ppm) 7.97–7.95 (d,

K2CO3 (0.054 g, 0.39 mmol, 3 equiv), and methyl
iodide (0.028 mL, 0.455 mmol) in 0.80 mL of DMF was stirred at 40
°C for 12 h. At the end of the reaction, 3 mL of deionized water
was added to the reaction vessel, and the mixture was acidified dropwise
with 2 M HCl to a pH of 3–5, as indicated by pH paper. The
aqueous mixture was extracted with DCM (3 × 30 mL), and the combined
extracts were dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and
concentrated by rotary evaporation. The crude mixture was chromatographed
on a silica gel column (3:7 v/v ethyl acetate in hexanes) to furnish
