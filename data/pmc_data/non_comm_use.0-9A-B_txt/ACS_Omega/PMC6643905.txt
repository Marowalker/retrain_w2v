Titania
has recently been identified as a new and effective nonlight-driven
catalyst for degradation of organic pollutant with the use of H2O2 as an oxidant; however, either relatively low
surface area or lack of diversity in chemical composition largely
limits its catalytic performance. In this work, a series of transition-metal
ion (Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, and Cu2+)-doped titania nanomaterials with regular flower-like morphology,
good crystallinity (anatase), and large specific surface areas (71.4–124.4
m2 g–1) were facilely synthesized and
utilized as catalysts for methylene blue (MB) degradation in the presence
of H2O2 without light irradiation. It was revealed
that the doping of transition-metal ions (especially Mn2+) into titania could significantly improve the catalytic efficiency.
At 30 °C, 10 mL of MB with a concentration of 50 mg L–1 could be completely degraded within 60–100 min for these
doped samples, whereas the removal rate was only 35.1% within 100
min with the use of pure flower-like titania. Temperature-dependent
kinetic studies indicated that the presence of transition-metal ion
dopants could markedly lower the activation energy and thus resulted
in enhanced catalytic performances. Test of reusability exhibited
that these doped catalysts could well keep their original catalytic
activities after reuse for several cycles, indicating their excellent
catalytic durability.

1 Introduction
Titania (TiO2) has attracted widespread interest during
past few decades owing to its high structural stability, nontoxicity,
biocompatibility, and unique physicochemical characteristics.1−3 Significant successes in the application of titania have already
been achieved, for instance, as a catalyst for photocatalytic degradation,4,5 as a solar-energy material for use in battery,6,7 and
as a tool for sensing detection.8,9 Recently, considerable
efforts have been also dedicated to determining the new application
possibility of titania in other research fields.

It has long
been known that exposure of TiO2 particles
to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) solution will enable
the formation of a yellowish substance on the surface of TiO2, which has been identified as a surface titanium peroxide complex.10,11 Interestingly, this complex is proven to be readily transformed
into reactive oxygen species, such as hydroxyl radical (•OH) and hydroperoxyl radical (•OOH), under ambient
conditions. Accordingly, the TiO2–H2O2 oxidative systems have been widely studied in the context
of nanoparticle toxicity because of their possible damage to physiological
tissues.12,13 However, up until now, only a few studies
have been carried out to investigate their potential applications
in environmental remediation.14,15 Ogino et al.16 reported for the first time that the TiO2 particles after incubation in H2O2 solution
could degrade methylene blue (MB) in the dark because of the strong
oxidation ability of the surface titanium peroxide complex. Recently,
Romanias et al.17 and Wiedmer et al.18 suggested a simplified protocol, that is, simultaneous
addition of TiO2 and H2O2 to the
MB solution without incubation treatment and found that the MB molecules
could be also degraded effectively. Noticeably, these pioneering works
not only confirmed the feasibility of using TiO2–H2O2 to degrade organic pollutants (e.g., MB) under
nonlight-irradiation conditions but also opened new opportunities
for expanding the application scope of TiO2. Unfortunately,
almost all of these early used TiO2 samples possessed relatively
small surface areas (i.e., 4.2–53.6 m2 g–1) with low porosities and therefore exhibited relatively weak catalytic
abilities, which somewhat limited their applications.

Three-dimensional
(3D) hierarchical structures have aroused significant
research interests in recent years because of their novel properties
and fundamental importance in various application fields.19−22 In particular, a number of unique 3D hierarchical structures (e.g.,
urchin-like and flower-like structures) well organized by low-dimensional
nanobuilding units are found to be highly attractive catalysts.23,24 Compared to the nonporous or low-porosity structures, the 3D hierarchical
structures usually possess larger surface areas and thus are expected
to exhibit higher catalytic abilities. Moreover, they can provide
much more exposed surface region, which will be fairly advantageous
for facilitating easy access of reactants. Very recently, Liu et al.25 reported the fabrication of an urchin-like titania
microstructure assembled by nanowires and its application as a nonlight-driven
catalyst toward MB degradation in the presence of H2O2. Because of the large specific surface area (158.8 m2 g–1) and highly open structure, this titania
indeed showed a significantly higher catalytic activity than the conventional
TiO2 samples (e.g., P25). Moreover, this catalyst was highly
reusable for the H2O2-mediated MB degradation,
that is, no significant activity loss after several cycles. Nevertheless,
despite achieving high catalytic activities at relatively high temperatures
(e.g., 60 °C), the catalyst was significantly less efficient
when the reaction temperature was below 50 °C. Therefore, further
efforts are still necessary to develop highly active hierarchical
titania nanostructures, which can achieve high efficiencies especially
at relatively low temperatures.

In fact, in many cases, tuning
the chemical composition of a solid
catalyst is also an efficient pathway to improve its catalytic activity.26 It is now well documented that many nontitania
oxide catalysts, once doped with transition-metal ions, can exhibit
markedly enhanced catalytic performances toward H2O2-mediated oxidative degradation. For example, Costa et al.27 introduced transition-metal ion (Co2+, Mn2+, or Ni2+) into the magnetite (Fe3O4) structure and found that the presence of these
ion dopants could obviously increase the catalytic activity of the
catalyst for the organic pollutant oxidation. Divya et al.28 fabricated a series of transition-metal ions
(Cu2+, Fe2+, Zr4+, Dy3+, and La3+) incorporated ceria (CeO2) materials
and demonstrated that the resulting materials had largely enhanced
activities in MB degradation as compared to pure ceria. Recently,
our group synthesized several Mn2+-doped magnetite samples
with different doping amounts and confirmed that the presence of Mn2+ dopant led to a more than twenty-fold increase in catalytic
efficiency.29 Inspired by these impressive
findings, we envisioned that the doping of some typical transition-metal
ions into titania substrates, especially those with 3D hierarchical
structures, might be able to address the current limitations of titania-based
nonlight-driven catalysis.

Herein, we reported the synthesis
of transition-metal ion (Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, and Cu2+)-doped
3D hierarchical titania nanospheres with flower-like morphologies
by a simple “hydrothermal treatment–calcination”
approach and their nonlight-driven catalytic performances toward H2O2-mediated MB degradation were systematically
evaluated. The selection of Mn2+, Cu2+, Co2+, and Ni2+ as dopants was mainly because they
have versatile redox chemistry which might be able to significantly
improve the catalytic activity of titania.30−32 For comparison
purpose, the flower-like titania nanospheres without metal ion doping
were also fabricated. It was confirmed that the presence of transition-metal
ion dopants (especially Mn2+) was indeed highly useful
to improve the catalytic activity of titania. For instance, the Mn2+-doped titania nanoflowers could decompose 100% of MB within
60 min in the presence of H2O2 at 30 °C,
whereas only 21.6% of MB was removed under identical conditions using
the undoped sample as a catalyst. In addition, the degradation kinetics
of undoped and doped samples at varied temperatures were investigated
in depth and the results indicated that the presence of transition-metal
ion dopants could markedly lower the activated energy and thus resulted
in enhanced catalytic performances. Through test of reusability, it
was revealed that all of these doped samples had excellent durability,
showing relative constant activities after reuse for several cycles.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of Materials
The
transition-metal ion (i.e., Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, and Cu2+)-doped 3D hierarchical titania nanospheres
were synthesized via a “hydrothermal treatment–calcination”
process using amorphous TiO2 spheres as a precursor, as
illustrated by Scheme 1. Corresponding to the types of dopants (Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, and Cu2+), the as-synthesized
doped samples were designated as Mn-FTiO2, Co-FTiO2, Ni-FTiO2, and Cu-FTiO2, respectively.
For comparison, the undoped TiO2 (designated as FTiO2) was also synthesized. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
images for the as-synthesized samples are shown in Figure 1. Clearly, the TiO2 precursor (pTiO2) is composed of monodisperse and uniform
spherical particles with diameters of 300–500 nm (Figure 1a). Upon hydrothermal
treatment in ethylenediamine (EDA)–ethylene glycol (EG) solution
at 150 °C for 24 h regardless of the absence or presence of transition-metal
salt, these amorphous TiO2 nanospheres would be etched
by EDA because of their amorphous nature and converted to amine titanate.33 In all cases, the resulting amine titanate particles
exhibited a unique flower-like architecture that is well organized
by nanosheets (not shown). Moreover, these nanoflowers also display
a high monodispersity, and their size is almost unchanged as compared
to the pTiO2 precursor. After calcination at 500 °C
for 2 h, all of the samples (FTiO2, Mn-FTiO2, Co-FTiO2, Ni-FTiO2, and Cu-FTiO2) still exhibit a 3D hierarchical flower-like morphology without
significant aggregation (Figure 1b–f). However, there is some difference in the
substructure between the calcined products. The nanosheets of Mn-FTiO2, Co-FTiO2, and Ni-FTiO2 exhibit a decrease
in regularity and a slight increase in thickness related to the FTiO2 sample. Particularly, the flower-like architecture of Cu-FTiO2 seems to be assembled by many nanograins rather than nanosheets.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Transition-Metal Ion-Doped 3D Hierarchical Titania
Nanospheres
Phase structures of
FTiO2, Mn-FTiO2, Co-FTiO2, Ni-FTiO2, and Cu-FTiO2 were investigated
using an X-ray diffraction (XRD) technology, and the results are presented
in Figure 2. The peaks
in the XRD pattern of FTiO2 should be assigned to the diffractions
of (101), (103), (105), (004), (200), (204), (112), (116), (211),
and (220) crystalline facets of anatase (JCPDS card; no. 21-1272),
reflecting that FTiO2 is composed of pure anatase.34 From Figure 2b–e, one can see that the doped samples (Cu-FTiO2, Co-FTiO2, Ni-FTiO2, and Mn-FTiO2) are still characteristic of anatase and only exhibit a slight
decrease in the intensity as compared to FTiO2. Moreover,
no other diffraction peaks appear, indicating that the metal ions
have been doped successfully into the TiO2 lattice.

Co-FTiO2 (c), Ni-FTiO2 (d), and Mn-FTiO2 (e).

Further investigations
were conducted to confirm the existence
of doped metal ions and to identify their oxidation states through
UV-diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) analyses. As shown in Figure 3, FTiO2 shows a strong absorption
edge at 383 nm, corresponding to the energy gap of 3.2 eV, which should
be explained by the electronic transition from the valence band of
TiO2 to its conduction band.35 Upon incorporation of metal ions, the absorption edge displays an
obvious shift to the red light zone, leading to various degree of
change for energy gap values (2.6 eV for Mn-FTiO2, 2.9
eV for Co-FTiO2, 3.1 eV for Ni-FTiO2, and 3.1
eV for Cu-FTiO2). Moreover, the doping of transition-metal
ions also makes the color significantly deepen in comparison with
the initial white of FTiO2 (insets of Figure 3). These observations in combination
with the XRD results further support the successful introduction of
transition-metal ions into the TiO2 lattice. Figure 4 gives the XPS survey spectra
in which the carbon peak should result from surface contamination
because of exposure to air. In addition, the evident 2p peaks appear
in the spectrum of each doped sample; however, no corresponding peaks
exist in the XPS spectrum of FTiO2. The high-resolution
XPS spectrum of the Ti 2p region indicates that Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 have the binding energies of 459.5 and 465.2
eV, respectively. The separation value (5.7 eV) between the two peaks
should be assigned to the Ti4+ ions in FTiO2.36 The 2p3/2 peaks are found
at 855.4, 779.4, 933.3, and 641.7 eV, whereas the 2p1/2 peaks are located at binding energies of 873.1, 795.2, 953.0, and
653.7 eV for Ni-FTiO2, Co-FTiO2, Cu-FTiO2, and Mn-FTiO2, respectively, revealing that the
oxidation states for all of these investigated transition-metal ions
are +2, well consistent with the previously reported XPS data.37−40 Moreover, the separation value (17.7 eV) between Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 peaks also reflects that Ni is presented
in the form of Ni2+ in the Ni-FTiO2 sample.
The XPS analysis also indicates an oxidation state of +2 for Co in
Co-FTiO2 because the separation value (15.8 eV) is very
close to the reported result (16 eV). In addition, there are strong
shake-up satellites in the spectra of both Ni-FTiO2 and
Co-FTiO2, which provide a further evidence of the oxidation
state of +2.

Porous characteristics of the as-synthesized materials were
investigated
by analyzing the nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms. As illustrated
by Figure 5, all of
these isotherms exhibit typical type IV curves, which reflect the
characteristics of mesoporous materials.41 Pore size distribution obtained by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) method shows a relatively narrow mesopore distribution (Figure 5b–e). The
texture parameters were further calculated, and the results are summarized
in Table 1. Evidently,
the 3D hierarchical flower-like structures of FTiO2, Mn-FTiO2, Co-FTiO2, Ni-FTiO2, and Cu-FTiO2 endow them with large surface areas (71.4–124.4 m2 g–1) and relatively high porosities (0.16–0.50
cm3 g–1). Such textual characteristics
should be considerably beneficial for achieving high catalytic performances.

2.2 Catalytic Performances
Availability
of Mn-FTiO2, Co-FTiO2, Ni-FTiO2,
and Cu-FTiO2 as nonlight-driven catalysts for organic pollutant
degradation was studied in neutral aqueous solutions with the use
of H2O2 as an oxidant. MB, a well-known organic
dye, was chosen as a model pollutant to test catalytic efficiency
of these samples. For comparison purpose, the catalytic performance
of FTiO2 toward MB was also studied. From Figure 6, it can be seen that FTiO2 exhibits a considerably limited catalytic ability for the
degradation of MB at 30 °C and only about 35.1% of MB molecules
is degraded within 100 min. Instead, the doped samples show high catalytic
efficiencies (Figure 6b–e). Under identical conditions, the MB can be degraded completely
within 60–100 min using the doped samples as catalysts (i.e.,
60 min for Mn-FTiO2 and Co-FTiO2; 100 min for
Ni-FTiO2 and Cu-FTiO2). Obviously, the transition-metal
ion doping indeed significantly enhances the catalytic performance.
Moreover, a number of previous studies have showed that the times
required to achieve a nearly complete removal of MB (≤50 mg
L–1) for some heterogeneous catalysts are in the
range of 120–1200 min, for example, 120 min for Prussian-blue-modified
γ-Fe2O3 (MB = 20 mg L–1),42 240 min for Fe3O4/FeMnOx (MB = 25 mg L–1),43 240 min for manganese-functionalized
silicate (MB = 50 mg L–1),44 300 min for α-Fe2O3/MCM-41 (MB = 10
mg L–1),45 360 min for
GT-Fe NPs (MB = 50 mg L–1),46 and 1200 min for Bi2CuO4 (MB = 20 mg L–1).47 The time values (60–100
min) reported in this study are lower than the bottom value of the
range, suggesting the high catalytic activities of these transition-metal
ion-doped FTiO2.

mg L–1) with different catalysts (a–e), degradation

In order to further ascertain contribution of FTiO2,
Mn-FTiO2, Co-FTiO2, Ni-FTiO2, and
Cu-FTiO2 to the MB degradation, several control experiments
were carried out and the obtained results are presented in Figure 6f. Not surprisingly,
the MB exhibits an almost unchanged concentration over the whole investigated
process without additions of any catalyst and H2O2 because MB itself is chemically stable in aqueous solution. Moreover,
it is observed that the use of H2O2 alone only
induces a negligible MB degradation within 100 min. When undoped or
doped titania is added without the use of H2O2, only a small part (<5%) of MB molecules is removed, indicating
that there is a weak interaction between MB molecules and the surfaces
of these materials investigated. In combination of results shown in Figure 6a–e, it can
be concluded that the MB degradation is mediated by H2O2, which can be effectively promoted by the TiO2-based catalysts, especially these doped samples.

Subsequent
experiments were conducted with temperatures ranging
from 30 to 50 °C so as to detect the influence of reaction temperature
on the catalytic degradation of MB; the results are shown in Figure 7. By observing the
plots of ln(C0/Ct) versus time, it can be found that the degradation
reactions of MB generally obey the pseudo-first-order kinetic model
in all cases. Accordingly, the rate constant k values
(min–1) were calculated, and the data are summarized
in Table 2. The reaction
rate constants increase with increasing reaction temperature, which
well agrees with the previously reported results.29 Moreover, the rate constants of transition-metal ion-doped
samples are always much higher than that of undoped FTiO2 under the identical conditions, further implying that the doping
of transition-metal ions is very effective in promoting the catalytic
efficiency. Here, it should be noted that although the doped samples
have identical doping contents of transition-metal ions (M2+/Ti4+ = 1:20; M2+: Mn2+, Co2+, Cu2+, or Ni2+), their specific surface
areas differ from each other (Table 1). Thus, further analysis is necessary to obtain reliable
quantitative structure–activity relationships. According to
the previously reported method,48,49 the pseudo-first-order
kinetic constants can be normalized to the surface areas of catalysts,
thereby offering the practical descriptors of contaminant degradation
kinetics. In our catalytic systems, each catalyst dosage was set at
0.005 g; thus, the absolute surface areas of FTiO2, Mn-FTiO2, Co-FTiO2, Ni-FTiO2, and Cu-FTiO2 were estimated to be 0.4285, 0.6220, 0.6575, 0.4095, and
0.3570 m2, respectively. Accordingly, the surface-area-normalized
kinetic constants (kSA; min–1 m–2) were calculated out, and the data are also
listed in Table 2.
Results show that the catalytic activities of these undoped and doped
samples should be ranked as follows: Mn-FTiO2 > Cu-FTiO2 > Ni-FTiO2 ≅ Co-FTiO2 ≫
FTiO2.

Then, the activation energy (Ea) can
be calculated according to the Arrhenius formula: k = A exp(−Ea/RT), in which k represents the
kinetic constant; A represents the pre-exponential
factor; R represents the gas constant with a value
of 8.314 J K–1 mol–1; and T represents the reaction temperature in kelvin.50 As the results presented, the Ea for MB degradation of MB on FTiO2 reaches
52.23 kJ mol–1, which is much higher than those
with the use of the doped samples as catalysts (27.34 for Co-FTiO2, 29.95 for Mn-FTiO2, 30.59 for Ni-FTiO2, and 31.64 kJ mol–1 for Cu-FTiO2).
These results indicate that the introduction of transition-metal dopants
can obviously lower the activation energy. Consequently, it can be
understandable that the doped samples show enhanced catalytic performances
for degradation of MB as compared to the pure titania sample (i.e.,
FTiO2). Meanwhile, it is also found that the catalytic
activity order of the four doped samples is inconsistent with the
magnitude of activation energy, which may due to the diverse Arrhenius
pre-exponential factors.51

The stability
and recyclability of heterogeneous catalysts are
crucial for their use in long-term processes. For this reason, we
tested the reusability of Mn-FTiO2, Co-FTiO2, Ni-FTiO2, and Cu-FTiO2 by repeatedly using
them as catalysts for H2O2-mediated degradation
of MB. After each cycle, the catalysts were collected via centrifugation
and then washed with water for the subsequent catalysis cycle. Five
consecutive cycles were studied, and the results are presented in Figure 8. Evidently, the
removal efficiencies of MB catalyzed by all of the doped samples remain
almost unchanged after five cycles. Compared with some recently reported
heterogeneous catalysts such as Fe0–Fe3O4–RGO (removal efficiency decreased by 25.6% after
5 cycles),52 Fe3O4@SiO2 (removal efficiency decreased by 57.5% after 5 cycles),53 Fe78Si9B13 (removal
efficiency decreased by 29.6% after 4 cycles),54 Fe@C-BN (removal efficiency decreased by 37.2% after 5
cycles),55 and Cu/MnO2 (removal
efficiency decreased by 33.3% after 5 cycles),56 our catalysts show significantly more satisfactory reusability.

3 Conclusions
In summary, a series of
transition-metal ion-doped TiO2-based catalysts (Mn-FTiO2, Co-FTiO2, Ni-FTiO2, and Cu-FTiO2) were successfully synthesized with
3D hierarchical flower-like morphology, anatase crystal phase, and
large surface areas (71.4–124.4 m2 g–1). Owing to the remarkable textural features and the presence of
transition-metal ion dopants, the doped catalysts, especially Mn-FTiO2, were proven to be highly efficient for MB degradation at
relatively low temperature (i.e., 30 °C). Compared to FTiO2, the doped catalysts can significantly lower the activation
energies for oxidative degradation of MB and thus display notably
faster catalytic kinetics. In addition, the as-fabricated catalysts
remained high activities even after being recycled several times,
demonstrating their excellent durability. Further investigation on
the activated mechanism of H2O2 by these doped
catalysts is in progress. We believe that the transition-metal ion-doped
TiO2 nanomaterials developed in this work will be very
promising for decontamination of wastewater-containing organic pollutants.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Chemicals and Reagents
EDA, acetonitrile,
EG, concentrated ammonium hydroxide (NH3·H2O, 28 wt %), ethanol, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 30 wt %), manganese chloride tetrahydrate (MnCl2·4H2O), cobalt chloride hexahydrate (CoCl2·6H2O), nickel chloride hexahydrate (NiCl2·6H2O), copper chloride dehydrate (CuCl2·2H2O), and MB were all purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent
Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Titanium isopropoxide (98%) was obtained
from by J&K Scientific Ltd. (Beijing).

4.2 Material
Synthesis
First, an amorphous
TiO2 precursor (designated as pTiO2) with the
monodispersed spherical morphology was prepared according to the previously
reported procedure.57 Afterward, transition-metal
ion-doped TiO2 catalysts were synthesized via a hydrothermal
treatment followed by a calcination process. Briefly, 0.4 g of TiO2 powders (5 mmol) was dispersed in a mixed solution containing
32 mL of EG and 8 mL of H2O, in which 0.25 mmol of transition-metal
chloride (i.e., MnCl2·4H2O, CoCl2·6H2O, NiCl2·6H2O, or
CuCl2·2H2O) was predissolved. Then, 96
mL of EDA was added rapidly under stirring. The mixture was sealed
in a 200 mL Teflon-lined autoclave. The hydrothermal reaction was
carried out at 150 °C for 24 h, and then the reaction solution
was allowed to be cooled to room temperature. The solid powders were
collected via centrifugation, followed by repeatedly washing with
water and ethanol. The final products (Mn-FTiO2, Co-FTiO2, Ni-FTiO2, and Cu-FTiO2) were formed
by calcination at 500 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 1 °C
min–1. For comparison, the undoped FTiO2 was also synthesized according to the same process without addition
of transition-metal salt.

4.3 Material Characterization
Morphologies
and sizes of the as-synthesized samples were determined on a field-emission
scanning electron microscope (SEM, SU8010, Hitachi, Japan). XRD analyses
were performed on an X-ray diffractometer (D8-FOCUS, Bruker, Germany).
Nitrogen adsorption/desorption measurements were carried out on a
Micromeritics ASAP2020 surface area analyzer at a temperature of 77
K. Absorbance spectra were recorded by a UV–vis diffuse reflectance
spectrometer (UV-DRS, UV-2550PC, Shimadzu Co., Japan). XPS analyses
were investigated using a VG Scientific ESCALAB Mark II spectrometer
that was equipped with two ultrahigh vacuum chambers.

4.4 Catalytic Activity Testing
Catalytic
activities of the as-synthesized catalysts were examined by MB degradation
in the presence of H2O2. Typically, 20 mL of
MB solution (50 mg L–1) containing 4.5 wt % H2O2 was added into a glass bottle that contained
10 mg of solid catalyst (0.5 g L–1), and the resulting
mixture was shaken (200 rpm) in the dark at 30 °C. At different
time points, the catalyst powders were separated from the reaction
solution by filtration. MB concentrations in the course of degradation
were determined using the UV–vis spectrophotometer to monitor
the absorption intensity at a wavelength of 665 nm.
