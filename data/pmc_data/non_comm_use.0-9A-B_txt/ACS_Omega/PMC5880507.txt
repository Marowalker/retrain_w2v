Bone tissue engineering
(BTE) requires a sturdy biomaterial for
scaffolds for restoration of large bone defects. Ideally, the scaffold
should have a mechanical strength comparable to the natural bone in
the implanted site. We show that adding cosolvent during the processing
of our previously developed composite of hydroxyapatite–gelatin
with a silane cross-linker can significantly affect its mechanical
strength. When processed with tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the cosolvent,
the new hydroxyapatite–gelatin composite can demonstrate almost
twice the compressive strength (97 vs 195 MPa) and biaxial flexural
strength (222 vs 431 MPa) of the previously developed hydroxyapatite–gelatin
composite (i.e., processed without THF), respectively. We further
confirm that this mechanical strength improvement is due to the improved
morphology of both the enTMOS network and the composite. Furthermore,
the addition of cosolvents does not appear to negatively impact the
cell viability. Finally, the porous scaffold can be easily fabricated,
and its compressive strength is around 11 MPa under dry conditions.
All these results indicate that this new hydroxyapatite–gelatin
composite is a promising material for BTE application.

1 Introduction
Bone
tissue engineering (BTE), an emerging field to deal with bone
defects, relies on using porous 3D scaffolds to provide temporary
support for bone regeneration.1 There are
several key considerations in designing a scaffold for BTE, including
biocompatibility, biodegradability, mechanical properties, scaffold
architecture, and fabrication technique.2 Among these, developing a resorbable scaffold with sufficient mechanical
properties during the initial healing phase of bone regeneration is
a significant challenge; this is because commonly used ceramics (e.g.,
tri-calcium phosphate) and polymers (e.g., poly-l-lactic
acid) typically demonstrate inadequate mechanical strength.3

Currently, there are three major types
of materials that are used
for BTE, namely, polymers, ceramics, and composites.4 Among these, composite materials have been shown to be
a promising option because they demonstrated tunable mechanical strength,
controllable degradation rate, and good biocompatibility.5 In fact, bone itself is a composite material,
consisting of an organic component (collagen) and an inorganic component
(hydroxyapatite, HAp). Previously, Chang et al. developed a hydroxyapatite–gelatin
(HAp–Gel) nanocomposite to mimic the structure of the nature
bone.6 Similar to the interaction between
various components in the nature bone, HAp–Gel showed chemical
bond formation between calcium cations of HAp nanocrystals and carboxyl
anions of Gel macromolecules. Furthermore, HAp–Gel had a self-organized
structure along the c-axis of crystalline HAp nanocrystals,
which would account for the improved mechanical strength of this composite.6 However, HAp–Gel was a particulate powder
and hard to fabricate into scaffold. To make it formable, the Ko group
used an aminosilane [i.e., bis[3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl]ethylenediamine
(enTMOS)] as the chemical linker to facilitate the binding and solidification
of HAp–Gel and named such a composite as HAp–Gemosil
(i.e., HAp–Gel modified with siloxane).7 Compared to previously developed glutaraldehyde linker-treated HAp–Gel,8 this new composite, HAp–Gemosil, demonstrated
improved processability and acceptable cell compatibility. Still,
the compressive strength of HAp–Gemosil was only ∼40%
of the corresponding value achieved by the cortical bone (80 vs 205
MPa9) under the similar experimental condition,
and the biaxial flexural strength of HAp–Gemosil was merely
∼18% of that achieved by the cortical bone (40 MPa vs 220 MPa10). To further improve the mechanical strength
of HAp–Gemosil, we have attempted to incorporate biocompatible
polymers to increase the toughness of HAp–Gemosil. For example,
we designed a silane-functionalized poly(l-lactide-co-propargyl carbonate) copolymer to enhance the long-range
interactions among different components by incorporating this copolymer
within the HAp–Gemosil composite.11 However, this polymer-enriched composite only improved the biaxial
flexural strength from 40 to 60 MPa, which is still much lower than
that of the natural bone.11 More recently,
we introduced polydopamine—a mussel adhesive protein-inspired
material that has excellent coating and adhesion properties—into
HAp–Gemosil, aiming to improve the adhesion between the hydrophilic
HAp–Gel particles and the hydrophobic siloxane matrix. However,
the compressive strength improvement was still limited, only from
80 to 100 MPa, which was caused by the lack of long-range interactions
among different components in the composites.12

These results made us speculate that the main reason for the
poor
mechanical strength of HAp–Gemosil might be the intrinsically
weak silane network in this composite. Given that the silane matrix
is the major component of the HAp–Gemosil composite (∼46%
by weight), engineering the silane network to dramatically improve
its mechanical strength would be an alternative—perhaps an
ideal—solution. The silane network formation is generally believed
to go through a sol–gel process. This process starts with hydrolysis
of alkoxide silane precursors to form silanol, followed by the condensation/polymerization
between the silanol groups to form siloxane (Si–O–Si)
linkages.13 The gel structure (e.g., morphology
and porosity), which decides the mechanical strength of the as-formed
silane network, can be significantly influenced by the processing
method and specific conditions, including pH, R ratio (R = [H2O]/alkoxide precursor),14 solvents,15 and drying process.13 As a result, to produce a gel with desirable properties, the processing
method and conditions need to be carefully optimized. Processing conditions
become even more important when preparing composite materials that
contain the silane network. For instance, an inhomogeneous mixing
of different components in the composite can induce internal cracks
during drying,13,16 which can significantly decrease
the final mechanical strength of such composites.

Among aforementioned
various factors that could influence the gel
structure, controlling the drying process of the sol to gel formation
has been shown to have a crucial impact on the mechanical property
of the final gel network.13 To improve
the drying while minimizing cracking, cosolvents17 have often been employed. Theoretically, different cosolvents
control different kinetics of hydrolysis and condensation, resulting
in different morphologies of the silane network (Scheme 1) with different physical properties.15 Thus, we hypothesized that control of cosolvents
in processing could further improve the mechanical properties of HAp–Gemosil.
Indeed, we find that by choosing the appropriate cosolvent, as detailed
below, the mechanical strength of HAp–Gemosil can be greatly
improved. Compared with the original HAp–Gemosil, the new HAp–Gemosil
composite—processed with tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the cosolvent—demonstrated
almost twice the mechanical strength of the original one without THF
(i.e., compressive strength: 97 vs 195 MPa and biaxial flexural strength:
222 vs 431 MPa). Furthermore, we show that the improvement of the
mechanical strength is due to the improved morphology of the silane
network and the uniform distribution of HAp–Gel in the enTMOS
matrix.

Scheme 1 enTMOS Network Formed in Different Solvent Systems
2 Experimental
Details
2.1 Materials
HAp–Gel and Ca(OH)2 powders were prepared by the method reported previously.6 Ca(OH)2 with chlorhexidine (CHX) was
prepared by doping 5–10% CHX into Ca(OH)2 powder.
enTMOS (95%) and 62% enTMOS in methanol (MeOH) were purchased from
Gelest, Inc. (Morrisville, PA, USA). Solvents, including methanol
(MeOH), ethanol (EtOH), acetonitrile (CH3CN), THF, tetrahydropyran
(THP), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), dimethoxyethane (DME), and 1,4-dioxane
were purchased from Alfa Aesar and used as received. Ammonium persulfate
(APS) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received.

2.2 Preparing the Composite
The method
for making the composites was adapted from the previous report.12 HAp–Gel (300 mg) and 200 mg of Ca(OH)2 with CHX powder were transferred into a mortar and ground
into fine powder. Then, the powdered mixture was spread on a glass
sheet, which was placed on a cold stage to maintain a depressed temperature
of—20 °C. The premixed enTMOS solution, including 360
μL of cosolvent, 200 μL of MeOH, and 500 μL of 95%
enTMOS, was then added into the powdered mixture quickly and mixed
continuously with a spatula for 30 s. Then, 80 μL of 7.5% APS
in MeOH/water (v/v = 3:7) was added to trigger the sol–gel
reaction. After mixing thoroughly, the mixture was poured into a disk
mold (size: diameter: 15.58 mm and thickness: 2.8 mm, designed for
3-point bending test), which lay on a smooth glass slide. Another
smooth glass slide was carefully covered at the top of the mold to
remove extra material. This “sandwich” structure (glass
slides at the top and the bottom and material in the disk mold in
between) was clamped and sealed into a plastic bag at room temperature
for one week to let the composite dry slowly. Finally, the sample
was further dried in an oven at 54 °C for 5 days before the flexural
strength test. The reason why the temperature was set at 54 °C
is because gelatin has been shown to degrade gradually around 100
°C, and collagen has been shown to denature to gelatin between
60 and 80 °C. Thus, we chose 54 °C to remove the remaining
solvent as well as to avoid the degradation of gelatin or collagen.
For comparison, composites without cosolvents, namely, all MeOH, were
also prepared according to the same procedure described above. Furthermore,
the previously reported HAp–Gemosil composite7 made from 62% enTMOS was also repeated here as a reference.
Additionally, cylinder-shaped samples with a 1:2 ratio of diameter
(3.8 mm) to length (7.6 mm) were made according to our previous report
with the same composition as described above.12 To prepare a pure enTMOS network without HAp–Gel and Ca(OH)2 CHX, APS was directly added to the premixed enTMOS solution.
After gelation, the same drying process was applied as described above.

2.3 Compressive and Biaxial Flexural Test
The
testing procedures were performed according to methods established
in our previous publication.11 Cylinder-shaped
samples (3.8 mm diameter by 7.6 mm length) or disk-shaped samples
(13 mm diameter by 2.5 mm thickness) were used for the compression
test and the 3-point bending test, respectively. Mechanical testing
was performed on an Instron machine (model 4411, Instron Co., Norwood,
MA, USA) with a cross-head speed of 0.5 mm/min. The same calculation
method11 was used to get compressive strength
and biaxial flexural strength. A minimum of three samples for each
group were used in all mechanical testing.

2.4 Fourier
Transform Infrared
Bulk composites
were ground into fine powder. Then, the fine powder was spread directly
on the diamond crystal and analyzed by Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) using the attenuated total reflection mode.

2.5 29Si Solid-State NMR
29Si CPMAS
NMR spectra were acquired on a Bruker DMX 360 MHz
WB NMR spectrometer operating at 71.55 MHz for 29Si and
at 360.13 MHz for 1H. A Q8M8 (i.e., octakis(trimethylsiloxy)silsesquioxane)
sample was used to calibrate the proton pulse width and the silicon
power level for the contact pulse (10 ms). A relaxation delay of 5
s and a sweep width of 27 kHz was used. Total number of scans ranged
from 4 to 16k. Spectra were processed with 50 Hz line broadening and
referenced to an external TMS sample.

2.6 Morphology
Study
For scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) analysis, a sample was carefully cut from the bulk
disk-shaped composite. Then, the sample cross section was sputter-coated
with gold in vacuum and imaged using Hitachi S-4700 cold cathode field
emission SEM (Hitachi High-Technologies America, Inc.). Energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis was performed to examine different
phases on sample’s cross section, which were analyzed by Inca
operator software. For transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis,
the bulk composite was ground into fine powder and suspended into
MeOH with sonication. Then, a small drop of this solution was added
to the TEM grid for imaging using JEOL 2010F-FasTEM (JEOL USA, Inc.).

2.7 3D Printing of the Composite
A 3D
cylindrical porous template (diameter: 5 mm, height: 10 mm, pore size:
400 μm, and porosity: 50%) was designed using SolidWorks software
(Dassault Systems SolidWorks Corp., Waltham, MA, USA). This template
(stl format) was then used to print a 3D wax mold made of Solidcape
Model (Solidscape Inc., Merrimack, NH, USA) with 0.16 mm2 trusses and 0.16 mm2 pore sizes (continuous space) using
a Solidscape 3D printer (Solidscape Inc., Merrimack, NH, USA). Next,
the composite mixture was prepared on the cold stage as described
above and injected to the 3D-printed mold before the materials were
let to solidify. After setting for 3–5 min, the wax mold and
the composite were immersed in acetone for 15 min to remove the wax
template and release the 3D porous composite-based scaffold, which
is shown in Figure 4a. The porous scaffold was air-dried for one week, followed by drying
at 52 °C for 4 days prior to the compression test. The same method
and data analysis were used here to obtain the compressive strength.
The compressive strength of the porous scaffold was averaged from
at least three samples.

2.8 Bulk Material Biocompatibility
Study via RealTime-Glo
MT Cell Viability Assay
Bulk disk samples (diameter: 6 mm
and thickness: 1 mm) made from THF/MeOH or MeOH were leached in H2O for 3 days, followed by gas sterilization and balanced in
the cell growth media overnight. The disk samples were then seeded
with rat mesenchymal stem cells (rMSCs) in a Costar 48-well plate
and incubated at 37 °C overnight to allow cells to attach. Then,
the disk samples were transferred into a new 96-well opaque plate
to prevent interwell interference during measurement, followed by
the addition of NanoLuc luciferase and a cell-permeant prosubstrate
and incubated at 37 °C. At predetermined time points (i.e., 0,
1, and 2 days), the illuminance of each well with the substrate was
measured by a Cytation 5 cell imaging multi-mode reader. Each group
with a minimum of three samples was tested for each time. The cell
viability result was averaged from three separate measurements.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Mechanical
Strength of HAp–Gemosil
with Different Solvents: Observation
According to previous
findings, on the one hand, low viscosity solvents can promote rapid
hydrolysis which would likely promote fast condensation reactions
to occur (because of the increased concentration of reactants for
condensation), resulting in a condensed network.15a On the other hand, nonpolar aprotic solvent is preferred
for a fast condensation reaction than polar protic and aprotic solvents.
This is because hydrogen bonding and/or electrostatic interactions
between polar solvents and nucleophilic substitution reaction intermediates
would slow the rate of condensation.15b To form a dense network of silane and thereby achieve higher mechanical
strength of such a network, one would need rapid hydrolysis and fast
condensation reactions. Thus, nonpolar aprotic solvents with low viscosity
would be ideal. To experimentally verify this hypothesis, we chose
a number of cosolvents in this study (Table 1). These cosolvents have different viscosity
values and can be categorized into three different groups (i.e., polar
protic, polar aprotic, and nonpolar aprotic). Moreover, the addition
of cosolvents will ensure more homogenous mixing of the components
in the composite.

 	4	DMSO/MeOH	1.99	189	138.01 ± 19.40	
nonpolar aprotic	5	THF/MeOH	0.46	66	431.35 ± 58.72	
 	6	THP/MeOH	0.52	88	471.40 ± 44.83	
 	7	Dioxane/MeOH	1.18	101.1	291.05 ± 75.75	
 	8	DME/MeOH	1.1	85	408.73 ± 51.38	
Our results in Table 1 clearly demonstrate that the cosolvent indeed has
a strong influence
on the biaxial flexural strength of the composite. First, as we expected,
among the three types of cosolvents we studied, aprotic ones—with
the exception of DMSO—improve the mechanical strength of the
composite more than protic ones. In some cases, we could even increase
the mechanical strength over 100% when compared with that of the original
HAp–Gemosil (prepared with MeOH only, entry 1 of Table 1). For instance, when using
CH3CN and THF as the cosolvents, the flexural strength
of such composites increases from 222 MPa to around 520 and 431 MPa,
respectively (entry 3 and entry 5 in Table 1). This can be explained by the fact that
THF and CH3CN are aprotic in nature, which can promote
fast condensation reaction when compared with the protic ones (such
as MeOH and EtOH). Moreover, THF and CH3CN also have relative
lower viscosity values, which would likely promote fast hydrolysis
reaction of enTMOS. For these reasons, the addition of THF or CH3CN would result in a dense silane network, as shown in Scheme 1 with higher flexural
strength. This can be further proved by the impressive improvement
of compressive strength, which increases from 97 MPa when processed
with pure MeOH to 195 MPa when adding THF as the cosolvent (Supporting Information Table S1, entries 2 and
4). However, if all MeOH was replaced by THF (i.e., THF only) or CH3CN (i.e., CH3CN only), the sol–gel reaction
would be completed too fast (gelation time was reduced to 2 min from
the original 5 min). The too fast cure rate would result in the incomplete
condensation reaction, evidenced by the opaque color of pure enTMOS
(Supporting Information Figure S5c,e),
leading to lower mechanical strength of such a composite. For instance,
the compressive strength and biaxial flexural strength of the THF-only
composite would decrease from 195 to 72 MPa and 430 to 152 MPa, respectively
(entry 4 and entry 5 in Table S1). Second,
for cosolvents in the same category, the boiling point of the cosolvent
also plays a role in the mechanical strength of the composite. For
instance, composites made from dioxane/MeOH and DME/MeOH have different
flexural strength, 291 vs 408 MPa (Table 1, entries 7 and 8). It appears that a close
match of the boiling point of the cosolvent with that of MeOH (65
°C) would help the drying process. In this specific case, the
boiling point of dioxane (101 °C) is too far from that of MeOH
than the boiling point of DME (85 °C). It is likely that having
a cosolvent with a boiling point similar to that of the primary solvent
can lead to a more uniform solvent evaporation, which can help reduce
the large cracks in the final composite and result in higher mechanical
strength. Finally, viscosity of the cosolvent does not appear to have
any correlation with the flexural strength of the final composite.
This can be seen from cases of CH3CN/MeOH, THF/MeOH, and
DME/MeOH. A range of viscosity values (0.37, 0.52, and 1.1) were observed,
yet all cosolvents offered similarly high flexural strength of the
final composites (over 400 MPa).

3.2 Hypothesis
We hypothesize that the
effect of the cosolvent on the mechanical strength of the HAp–Gemosil
composite is mainly due to the combined effects from hydrolysis and
condensation of silanes that changed the morphology of the composite,
rather than from cosolvent-induced chemical reactions/interactions
between different components within the composite. Specifically, adding
cosolvents into the processing solvent (i.e., MeOH) can have two functions
during the composite formation. First, mixing different cosolvents
with MeOH increases the total volume of the solvent when compared
with the original processing method reported previously. The extra
solvent would allow the various components, including HAp–Gel,
Ca(OH)2, and enTMOS, to mix more homogenously. Second,
the cosolvent can have a subtle impact on the morphology of the enTMOS
network in the final composite (i.e., branched or condensed network,
shown in Scheme 1),
likely caused by the different rates of hydrolysis and condensation
when a different cosolvent is applied. As discussed earlier, the polarity
and boiling point of the cosolvent can have a direct impact on these
fundamental steps (i.e., hydrolysis and condensation) in the sol–gel
process. Macroscopically, composites processed with an appropriate
cosolvent would show less cracks/holes, which would benefit a higher
mechanical strength. Finally, because the solvent can be completely
removed during the drying process, the biocompatibility of these composites
can be maintained in addition to the improved mechanical strength.

3.3 Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
To experimentally verify the hypothesis, we first applied FTIR
spectroscopy to identify specific chemical bonds in the final gel
structure and to monitor the sol–gel reaction process.18 We started with pure enTMOS gels formed from
different cosolvent/MeOH systems to probe whether the cosolvent reacted
with enTMOS. Three representative cosolvent/MeOH systems from these
three different types (Table 1) were selected, THF/MeOH, CH3CN/MeOH, and MeOH
only. First, the FTIR of a pure enTMOS network prepared with CH3CN/MeOH and THF/MeOH shows characteristic peaks for enTMOS
gels (e.g., Si–O–Si stretching at 1029 and 1118 cm–1), indicating the formation of an aminosilica matrix.
As expected, enTMOS gels made from different cosolvent/MeOH systems
demonstrated almost identical absorption spectra (from 4000–400
cm–1) to that of the enTMOS gel made from MeOH only
(Figure 1a). This indicates
that the cosolvent did not react with the enTMOS during the sol–gel
process. Moreover, the almost identical absorbance of peaks corresponding
to the Si–O–Si bond for enTMOS processed with different
solvents indicates that the total amount of the Si–O–Si
bond is comparable across the samples. We also performed 29Si solid-state NMR to further investigate the variety of Si bonds
(e.g., Si–O–Si and Si–OH) that were involved
in the sol–gel process. As shown in the Supporting Information Figure S2, for all silane networks
with different processing cosolvents, we observed two Si peaks. The
signal at—65 ppm is corresponding to the formation of Si–O–Si,
whereas the other signal at—58 ppm is attributed to the Si–OH
structure from the incomplete condensation.19 Again, the 29Si NMR spectra are very similar across the
samples, implying a similar amount of Si species. Second, to examine
whether the cosolvent would react with other components in the HAp–Gemosil
composite, that is, HAp–Gel and Ca(OH)2 with CHX,
we applied FTIR to study the HAp–Gemosil composite. Again,
these FTIR spectra of composites made from different cosolvent/MeOH
systems are almost identical to each other (Figure 1b), indicating that the cosolvent did not
react with the remaining components [i.e., HAp–Gel and Ca(OH)2 with CHX] in the HAp–Gemosil system. Most importantly,
we did not observe any cosolvent/MeOH characteristic absorptions in
all FTIR spectra, indicating that the solvent was completely removed
after drying. This is ideal for BTE application because the residual
cosolvent (if any) could be toxic.

HAp–Gemosil composites
prepared from different solvent systems.

3.4 Morphology
Results from the FTIR
study rule out the possibility that the improvement of mechanical
strength of these cosolvent-treated composites was from cosolvent-induced
chemical interactions/reactions. Thus, it is very likely that the
optimized morphology of the HAp–Gemosil composite is the main
reason for the improved flexural strength. We next applied SEM to
investigate the morphology (i.e., phase distribution and porosity)
of the composite formed from different cosolvent/MeOH systems and
of a pure enTMOS network. We chose to study the cross section of the
composite made from two representative cosolvent/MeOH systems, namely,
CH3CN/MeOH and THF/MeOH. We also investigated composites
made from MeOH and THF only as the reference. From the cross-section
images of these composites (Figure 2), one can clearly observe that the composite formed
from CH3CN/MeOH or THF/MeOH has a much smoother surface
(less visual cracks), which agrees well with the greatly improved
flexural strength of the composites (Table 1). In contrast, the composite made from MeOH
only has large cracks (Figure 2a). Furthermore, there are two distinct phases probed by EDS:
one is enriched with HAp–Gel, while the other is enriched with
the silsesquioxane phase (Supporting Information Figure S3). Comparing the phase distribution in composites made
from MeOH only or THF only with that in composites made from CH3CN/MeOH or THF/MeOH, the enTMOS phases and HAp–Gel
phases distribute more homogenously with the addition of a cosolvent
(CH3CN or THF). We attribute this homogenous phase distribution
to the increased total volume of the solvent with the addition of
the cosolvent, which would help the homogenous mixing of different
components.

Figure 2 SEM images of composites made from (a) MeOH only; (b) CH3CN/MeOH; (c) THF/MeOH; and (d) THF only. Inset: the physical appearance
of the composite under that condition.

More importantly, these cosolvents can control the drying
process
of forming the HAp–Gemosil composite because the mixed solvent
(cosolvent + MeOH) would have a slower evaporation rate than that
of the pure MeOH. If this were the case, a further deviation of the
boiling point of the cosolvent from that of the main solvent (i.e.,
MeOH) would have a more appreciable effect on the drying process and
the morphology of the as-formed composite. Indeed, the composite made
from dioxane/MeOH (Supporting Information Figure S4c) shows larger cracks than the one made from THF/MeOH.
This can be ascribed to the fact that the boiling point of dioxane
(101 °C) is too far from that of MeOH than that of THF (66 °C).

While our results show that mixing cosolvents into the main solvent
can be beneficial to improving the morphology and mechanical strength
of our composites, having pure cosolvents alone (i.e., cosolvent as
the sole solvent) cannot offer the same improvement. This can be seen
by comparing the composite made from cosolvent/MeOH with that made
from THF only. The composite made with THF only shows less homogeneity
and weaker mechanical strength (Figure 2d and entry 5 in Table S1). We speculate that rapid gelation would occur when pure THF was
used, which would lead to the inhomogeneous mixing of different components
in the composite.

Finally, we applied TEM to investigate more
details about each
component in the composite. In principle, if the cosolvent did not
react with the HAp–Gel crystal, we should be able to observe
intact HAp–Gel crystals. Indeed, TEM images of composites show
that the HAp–Gel nanocrystals remain intact after the processing
with cosolvents (Supporting Information Figure S6). This further proves that the improvement of mechanical
strength by these cosolvents could be solely related to the optimized
enTMOS matrix structure and the more homogenous mixing of different
components in the composite.

3.5 Biocompatibility Study
Good biocompatibility
of the composite is a prerequisite for BTE. A previous study has demonstrated
that HAp–Gemosil has good biocompatibility.7 In the current study, we add a cosolvent and CHX as additional
components during the processing, and there is a possibility that
the residual cosolvent and CHX could lead to cell toxicity. To investigate
this possible pitfall, the following experiments were carried out.
We chose THF/MeOH as the representative cosolvent/MeOH system and
varied the amount of the cosolvent and CHX as independent variables.
Experimentally, four different types of composites made from (a) MeOH
and Ca(OH)2, (b) MeOH and Ca(OH)2 CHX, (c) THF/MeOH
and Ca(OH)2, and (d) THF/MeOH and Ca(OH)2 CHX
were incubated with cells. The viability of the potential transplanted
cells in BTE application, rMSCs, was monitored by RealTime-Glo MT
cell viability assay. We used this method to distinguish the direct
toxicity monitored by the cells attached to the composites and the
leaching toxicity measured by the cells in the well surrounding the
bulk materials. However, a quick screening showed poor cell attachment
on the bulk composite made from Ca(OH)2 with CHX and its
surrounding area in the cell culture well, which indicated acutely
direct and leaching cytotoxicity resulting from CHX. We thus focused
on comparing the cell toxicity of group (a) and group (c) to understand
the impact of THF on cell viability. As shown in Figure 3, the luminescent reading gradually
increased from day 0 to day 1, suggesting that the addition of THF
during the composite processing did not decrease the cell viability
compared with the nontoxic composite processed with MeOH only. The
decreased luminescence on day 2 may result from either the exhaustion
of reagents or the confluency of cells on the composite. Importantly,
we further discovered that even when we replaced Ca(OH)2 CHX with just Ca(OH)2, the compressive strength of composites
(with or without CHX) was comparable (Supporting Information Table S2). Therefore, we recommend to replace Ca(OH)2 CHX with Ca(OH)2 for future use of the composites
where good biocompatibility is required.

3.6 3D-Printed Scaffold Formation and Mechanical
Testing
In addition to biocompatibility, other important
considerations for scaffolds intended for BTE include the feasibility
of forming porous structures yet still maintaining good mechanical
strength. To this end, we fabricated a 3D porous structure with the
HAp–Gemosil (THF/MeOH) composite via computer-aided design.
A good control on the porous architecture can be achieved (Figure 4a). Moreover, porous scaffold processed with THF/MeOH has
a compressive strength ∼11.33 ± 1.25 MPa, increased by
∼ 60% compared to the compressive strength of the scaffold
processed with MeOH (6.94 ± 1.01 MPa) (Figure 4b). This increment further proves the effect
of cosolvents in improving mechanical strength of the HAp–Gemosil
composite. Furthermore, the achieved compressive strength of the scaffold
processed with cosolvents is comparable to that (1–13 MPa)
of the cancellous bone.20 All these indicate
a great potential of such a scaffold for BTE. Further, the in vivo
test is in progress to access the feasibility of such scaffolds for
biomedical applications.

400 μm, porosity:

with different cosolvents (student t-test, P = 0.0001).

4 Conclusions
In conclusion, we successfully
improved the mechanical strength
of our previously developed HAp–Gemosil composite significantly
with the aid of selected cosolvents (e.g., THF, CH3CN,
THP, etc.). We further demonstrated that the improvement of mechanical
strength was not due to chemical interactions/reactions between the
different components in HAp–Gemosil and cosolvents. Instead,
adding cosolvents helped the enTMOS network formation and the composite
processing. As a result, the likely uniformly cross-linked enTMOS
matrix and the more homogenous composite would result in higher mechanical
strength. Moreover, we showed that the cosolvent/MeOH could be completely
removed from the composite during the drying process, thus having
minimum impact on the biocompatibility of this new HAp–Gemosil
composite. Finally, we demonstrated that the porous scaffold processed
with cosolvents can be easily made yet can maintain good compressive
strength. All these results point to that this newly modified HAp–Gemosil
composite is a very promising candidate for BTE. Currently, we focus
on evaluating the effect of this new scaffold for bone regeneration
in vivo.
