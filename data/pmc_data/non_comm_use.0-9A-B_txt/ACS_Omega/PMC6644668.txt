Perylene diimides (PDIs) are promising
candidates for n-type semiconductor
materials and, thus, for use in organic electronics. Thionation of
the imide moiety provides an efficient strategy to control the donor–acceptor
gap of these types of compounds, although the degree and selectivity
of thionation can be hard to achieve. Through the design of a sterically
encumbered PDI–phenothiazine dyad, a previously unattained
geminal thionation pattern has been realized, providing the first
example of a perylene-monoimide-monothioimide. The electrochemical
and solid-state structural properties of this uniquely thionated dyad
are reported and compared to those of the nonthionated parent molecule.
It is found that thionation enhances the electron affinity of the
PDI core, affecting electrochemical and spectroelectochemcial behavior
of the dyad without significantly affecting the solid-state packing
of the molecules.

Introduction
Perylene diimides (PDIs)
tend to have intense colors, high electron
affinities, and excellent photochemical and thermal stabilities.1−3 PDIs are excellent candidates for n-type semiconductor materials
for organic electronic applications including organic field-effect
transistors,4 organic light-emitting diodes5,6 and dye-sensitized solar cells,7−9 and when suitably functionalized
can be used as photoelectric materials10 and show nonlinear optical properties.11

Straightforward synthetic modification of PDIs allows for
the tuning
of electronic12 and photochemical13 properties, solubility1 and solid state,14 and supramolecular15,16 organization. Recently, chalcogen substitutions to the carbonyl
positions of the PDI scaffold have been employed as a means of affecting
the frontier orbitals without significant perturbation to the molecular
structure. Studies into thionated PDIs17−19 and their smaller analogues,
naphthalene diimides (NDIs)20−26 and pyromellitic diimides,27 have shown
an enhancement in electron mobility in organic transistors, as well
as providing a straightforward means of accessing the triplet manifold
of PDI without the need for heavy atom substitutions or an additional
sensitizer.

Synthetic strategies targeting thionated rylene
diimides employ
Lawesson’s reagent as the source of sulfur atoms and tend to
be nonselective, resulting in a series of compounds bearing between
one and four substituted carbonyls.17−27 In the case of dithionated PDIs and NDIs, three regioisomers are
possible with sulfur substituents cis, trans, and geminate to each
other, although the current literature contains no reports of isolated
geminate thionation products of PDIs.12 In the case of NDIs, Welford et al.25 were able to isolate a geminately thionated product, albeit in very
low yield when compared to the other dithionated isomers. The geminate
compound was only one-eighth as prevalent as the cis and trans variants and
was produced in lower quantity than the trithionated NDI product,
suggesting that thionation usually occurs on opposite imide groups
before adjacent imide carbonyls can be substituted.

Recent work
has shown that it is possible to selectively produce
either cis20 or trans21,22 dithionated regioisomers through steric influence of core substituents.
Indeed, our earlier work with asymmetric NDI compounds indicated that
geminate dithionation can readily occur adjacent to an aryl-imide
substituent, but dithionation next to aliphatic imides is hampered,
selectively producing only one of the two possible trithionated regioisomers
of a mixed N-aryl/N-alkyl NDI.26 Although
no similar examples exist for PDI compounds, likely because of the
difficulty of controlling levels of orthosubstitution, it is assumed
that the principle of sterically selecting which carbonyls can be
thionated will hold.

Herein, we describe a steric approach to
the synthesis of an unprecedented
geminately dithionated PDI–phenothiazine dyad, using a bulky
aromatic substituent on one imide terminus of the PDI to limit access
to one pair of carbonyls. The electrochemical and optical properties
of this thionated PDI are compared to those of its nonthionated parent.

Results
and Discussion
Synthesis and Crystallography of Nonaggregating
Asymmetric PDIs
PDIs are often prone to aggregation as a
result of intermolecular
interactions between their extended aromatic cores, potentially limiting
solubility in common organic solvents. In this study, solubility of
the target PDIs was essential for characterization and is also desirable
for future device fabrication: prohibition of aggregation aides charge
separation in donor–acceptor films,28 which are commonly produced from spin coating. To this end, we have
developed a very sterically hindering tecton, 2,6-(bis)diphenylmethyl-4-methylphenyl
(BDPA), whose structure is based upon an elaboration
of 2,6-diisopropylaniline, a commonly used solubilizing group in PDI
chemistry. In this study, the BDPA moiety was used to
functionalize one of the imide groups in the synthesis of asymmetric
PDIs, providing both steric inhibition to substitution at one imide
and solubility for the target molecule.

The synthesis of the
PDI-phenothiazine dyad (PDIS0-PTZ) followed a synthetic strategy described by Xue
et al.29 to prepare asymmetric PDIs (Scheme 1). Commercially available
perylene-3,4,9,10-dianhydride was first esterified with four n-decyl chains. An acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the resultant
tetraester selectively formed a perylene monoanhydride diester which
was then condensed with 2,6-(bis)diphenylmethyl-4-methylphenylaniline
to produce a mixed monoimide diester. The remaining two ester groups
were subsequently cleaved giving a perylene-monoimide-monoanhydride
(PMI-BDPA) capable of reaction with a second amine, thereby
forming an asymmetric PDI. The effectiveness of the 2,6-(bis)diphenylmethyl-4-methylphenyl
tecton as a solubilizing group for PDIs is demonstrated upon production
of PMI-BDPA, which despite only containing a single imide
functionality (and no bay-region substitution) is sufficiently soluble
for characterization by 13C NMR spectroscopy.

Scheme 1 Synthesis
of PMI-BDPA and PDI-BDPA2
An X-ray crystallography
study of single crystals of PMI-BDPA revealed that although
π-stacking is present in the solid
state, it is limited to antiparallel pairs of molecules (Figure 1A). The perylene
planes of these pairs of molecules are separated by 3.36 Å, typical
for π-stacked compounds,30 extending
to a substantial 6.84 Å between the aromatic cores of adjacent
nonstacked molecules. A slight twisting of the perylene plane is also
observable: the torsion angle between the two naphthalene rings that
comprise a single perylene core is 7.2°. The ability of the bulky
2,6-bis(diphenylmethyl-4-methylphenyl) group to interfere with the
π-stacking normally observed for PDIs is apparent, showcasing
the power of this new group for imide functionalization, particularly
in asymmetric PDI synthesis, allowing for an unrestricted choice of
second imide group without solubility concerns.

distances shown. (B) Crystal packing of PDI-BDPA2 showing distance between centroids of adjacent
molecules. Atom colors—C: gray, H: white, Cl: green, N: blue,
and O: red.

In addition to PMI-BDPA, the symmetric diimide analogue
with 2,6-(bis)diphenylmethyl-4-methylphenyl substituents at both imide
termini, PDI-BDPA2, was prepared,
and single crystals were grown by vapor diffusion of hexane into a CHCl3 solution of the compound. The compound crystallized in the
space group I2/a, with the asymmetric
unit containing half a molecule of PDI-BDPA2 and two CHCl3 molecules. The imide-substituted
phenyl ring lies almost perpendicular to the perylene plane, with
an angle between the phenyl plane and the perylene core of 81.1°.
The diphenylmethyl branches protrude from the aromatic backbone of
the molecule, blocking any potential π–π interactions.
Examination of the intermolecular packing reveals this to be the case:
the distance between centroids of adjacent PDI-BDPA2 molecules is 11.47 Å (Figure 1B), over three times greater
than the typical separation observed for PDIs of 3.40 Å.1 This represents a huge translational offset and
allows solvent CHCl3 molecules to comfortably fit between
adjacent PDI molecules. The absence of π–π interactions
extends to solution measurements. The UV/vis spectrum of PDI-BDPA2 shows S0 to S1 electronic
transitions of the PDI core, with well-defined vibrational structure
and relative intensities characteristic of discrete molecules in solution.
Furthermore, a solution-phase fluorescence quantum yield of 1.00
for PDI-BDPA2 is consistent with
the absence of aggregation.

Synthesis and Thionation of PDI-Dyads
In line with
our previous work using NDIs,26 a phenothiazine
electron donor group was condensed with PMI-BDPA to produce PDIS0-PTZ (Scheme 2). The photophysics of a series
of phenylene-spaced phenothiazine–PDI dyads has been investigated
by the Wasielewski and co-workers,31 noting
efficient charge separation between the two chromophores to form a
PDI•–-Ph-PTZ•+ radical
pair. Thus, PDIS0-PTZ was prepared by reaction of PMI-BDPA with 10-(4-aminophenyl)-10-H-phenothiazine.31PDIS0-PTZ was thionated with Lawesson’s
reagent26 (Scheme 2) affording a blue compound, in contrast
to the red color of PDIS0-PTZ, that was identified as PDIS2-PTZ by mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy.
The mass spectrum was consistent with two sulfur substitutions, indicating
that the product could exist as one of the four isomers. The 1H NMR spectrum of the blue product revealed four pairs of
doublets for the aromatic protons of the perylene core (as was the
case for the nonthionated PDIS0-PTZ) and the 13C NMR spectrum contained
only one C=O and one C=S peak, excluding the possibility
of a mixture of cis- or trans-isomers. Thus, both sulfur atoms must
be contained within the same imide group, implying a monoimide monothioimide
structure. Two such geminately substituted isomers are possible: one
with the thioimide located at the phenothiazine terminus and the other
with the thioimide at the 2,6-bis(diphenylmethyl-4-methylphenyl) end.
NMR spectroscopy implies the former because the protons
of the phenylene spacer between the perylene and phenothiazine chromophores
are strongly affected by the thionation, splitting from a single peak
corresponding to all four phenylene protons of PDIS0-PTZ to two smaller multiplets
for each pair of protons for PDIS2-PTZ. No substantial shift was detected for protons
of the BDPA group. Additionally, the X-ray crystal structure
(see below) of PDIS2-PTZ confirms that the thionation occurred at the phenothiazine terminus.
This result was expected because of the steric hindrance provided
by the aromatic features of the BDPA moiety, and our
previous work indicating thionation can readily occur proximal to
the phenothiazine-substituted terminus.

Scheme 2 Synthesis of PDI
Dyads PDIS0-PTZ and PDIS2-PTZ
Single crystals of suitable quality for X-ray
diffraction studies
were obtained for both PDIS0-PTZ and PDIS2-PTZ by vapor diffusion of pentane into a CHCl3 solution of
the target compound (Figure 2). Both molecules crystallized in the space group P21/c, with one molecule in
the asymmetric unit. Both molecules pack similarly: when viewed along
the crystallographic b-axis, it can be seen that
the phenothiazine group of one molecule lies close to the perylene
core of its neighbor (see the Supporting Information for the figure). An additional polymorph of PDIS2-PTZ was obtained by slow evaporation
from CHCl3 that contains a π-stacked pair of molecules
and two crystallographically resolved CHCl3 molecules,
this time in the space group P21/n. The crystal structure of PDIS2-PTZ unambiguously confirms the sulfur
substitution positions with the C=S bond lengths averaging
1.64 Å versus 1.22 Å for the same two C=O bonds of PDIS0-PTZ.

Spectroscopy and Electrochemistry
In line with the
data from Tilley et al.,17 the dithionated
PDI forms intense blue solutions in CH2Cl2. PDIS0-PTZ, similar to
most PDIs without core substitution, is orange in solution but distinguishes
itself through a lack of observable fluorescence, signifying that
the presence of the phenothiazine chromophore acts to quench fluorescence.
In contrast to our previously reported NDI-phenothiazine dyads,26 the PDI homologues do not change color from
the solution to the solid state. In the UV/visible spectra, PDIS0-PTZ displays a
distinctive band at λmax = 533 nm, resulting from
S0 to S1 electronic transition, with well-defined
vibrational structure, the relative intensity of which is indicative
of a nonaggregated PDI core in solution. Thionation bathochromically
shifts the absorption maximum of PDIS2-PTZ to 633 nm, a difference of 100 nm compared
with PDIS0-PTZ.
Both molecules’ spectra display an additional band at 259 nm,
attributed to the phenothiazine chromophore (see below for further
discussion of UV/visible spectra of the neutral species).

Both
dyads were probed by cyclic voltammetry to investigate their electrochemical
behavior. Each compound was found to exhibit two-reversible one-electron
reduction processes and one-reversible one-electron oxidation, along
with a second oxidation process, that was not reversible under the
experimental conditions (Figure 3, Table 1). PDIS0-PTZ was
reduced at −0.94 and −1.16 V (vs Fc+/Fc),
consistent with typical PDIs.32 As expected,
an anodic shift in the reduction potentials occurred following thionation,19 with PDIS2-PTZ being reduced at −0.68 and −0.93
V (vs Fc+/Fc). Although the thionation-induced shift in
reduction potential is a substantial 260 mV, the effect of thionation
is less prominent for the PDI systems than their NDI counterparts
(for a comparable pair of NDI-dyads, the reduction potential increased
by 360 mV).24 Thionation lowers the lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy of the PDI core, improving
its power as an electron acceptor.17,18 The oxidation
potentials for the PDI dyads are 0.33 and 0.32 V (vs Fc+/Fc) for PDIS0-PTZ and PDIS2-PTZ,
respectively, virtually identical to each other and to those of previously
reported NDI–phenothiazine.26 It
is notable that the phenothiazine oxidation is unaffected by thionation
of the PDI.

The optical absorbance of PDIS0-PTZ and PDIS2-PTZ was probed using spectroelectrochemical
techniques to
investigate the change in absorbance profiles upon each reduction
and oxidation of the compounds. Upon reduction of PDIS0-PTZ to [PDIS0-PTZ]•–, the absorbance bands of the neutral species were replaced by intense
bands at lower energy (Figure 4), consistent with results for other PDIs.12,19,32 A similar transformation occurs upon reduction
of PDIS2-PTZ (Figure 5), although the emergent
band at 768 nm is less structured and more intense ([PDIS0-PTZ] λmax = 716 nm, ε = 72 800 mol–1 dm3 cm–1; and [PDIS2-PTZ] λmax = 768 nm,
ε = 142 100 mol–1 dm3 cm–1). The progress of reduction from [PDIS0-PTZ]− to
[PDIS0-PTZ]2– gave changes in the UV/vis profile that were typical
of a PDI, with depletion of the newly formed low-energy bands associated
with [PDIS0-PTZ]− and an emergence of new peaks for [PDIS0-PTZ]2– of
a similar intensity and energy to those of the neutral compound (Figure 4). A similar result
is obtained for the reduction of [PDIS2-PTZ]•– to [PDIS2-PTZ]2– (Figure 5). Oxidation of the
two PDI dyad compounds saw an emergent band at ∼515 nm corresponding
to the oxidized phenothiazine chromophore which overlapped with transitions
of the PDI core. All process studies were reversible under the conditions
of the experiment. See Table 2 for a summary of the UV/visible spectral data.

As mentioned above, PDIS0-PTZ is essentially nonemissive indicating that
the normally
strong fluorescence associated with a nonaggregated PDI is quenched
by the addition of the phenothiazine group. The emission process for
a very similar phenothiazine–PDI system, recently reported
by Shoer et al.,33 was also quenched, attributed
to complete charge transfer as determined by the results of femtosecond
transient absorption spectroscopy. PDIS2-PTZ is also nonemissive: in addition to the charge-transfer-induced
quenching, intersystem crossing to a triplet state is also possible,
as reported for thionated PDIs by Tilley et al.17

EPR measurements were recorded for the reduced, [PDIS0-PTZ]− and
[PDIS2-PTZ]−, and oxidized, [PDIS0-PTZ]+ and [PDIS2-PTZ]+, dyad species (Figure 6). As expected, the
LUMO of the dyads lies on the PDI moiety, evidenced by the complex
EPR spectrum for the reduced molecules which signifies coupling of
the radical electron to many sets of nonequivalent nuclei (i.e., the
four pairs of hydrogen atoms and two nitrogen atoms that comprise
the PDI core, where the radical electron is assumed to reside). The
molecules’ highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is phenothiazine-based
with similar EPR spectra recorded for both PDI dyads and analogous
to those of our NDI–phenothiazine compounds.26 The experimentally determined giso values for the two oxidized PDI dyads are identical to each other
and to those of the NDI dyads at 2.0055. Such a consistency across
this range of molecules is further evidence that the phenothiazine
HOMO is fully separated from various acceptor orbitals. The giso values for PDIS0-PTZ and PDIS2-PTZ are 2.0033 and 2.0063, respectively: the increase
in value is attributed to the “heavy atom effect” as
seen for other thionated molecules discussed.19,26

Conclusions
Through the introduction
of a large aromatic 2,6-bis(diphenylmethyl-4-methylphenyl)
moiety that limits π–π interactions and, thus,
aggregation, we have demonstrated that the solubility of PDIs can
be greatly improved while still maintaining a rigid conformation.
This bulky solubilizing group was used in the synthesis of asymmetric
PDI–phenothiazine dyads and enabled solution-phase electrochemical
and spectroelectrochemical characterization. The steric encumberment
of one terminus of the PDI allows access to an unprecedented geminate
sulfur substitution pattern upon thionation with Lawesson’s
reagent. Cyclic voltammetry revealed that geminate dithionation resulted
in a decrease of the HOMO–LUMO gap. Our studies indicate that
modification of the frontier orbitals through thionation is readily
achieved in PDI-based donor–acceptor dyads, allowing tuning
of the HOMO–LUMO energy gap in such systems. It is also evident
that the use of steric inhibition of imide groups prohibitsthionation
in asymmetric PDI systems facilitating geminate dithionation
strategies.

Methods
All of the reagents were purchased from commercial
suppliers and
used without further purification. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker AV(III)400HD spectrometer.
MALDI-TOF MS spectra were recorded on a Bruker Ultraflex III spectrometer
using trans-2-[3-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-2-methyl-2-propenylidene]-malononitrile
as the matrix. EI M/S spectra were taken using a Bruker Apex IV 4.7
T mass spectrometer. Elemental analyses were recorded on a CE-440
Elemental Analyzer. Standard UV/vis spectra were collected on a PerkinElmer
Lambda 25 spectrophotometer using either a 1 or 10 cm pathlength quartz
cuvette. Fluorescence spectra were recorded as aerated solutions using
a Jobin Yvon Horiba FluoroMax-3 spectrometer at ambient temperatures
in a 1 cm pathlength quartz cuvette. Quantum yields were calculated
in comparison with the fluorescence observed for perylene orange (Φ
= 0.99 in CHCl3) under identical conditions of irradiation.34

Electrochemical Measurements
Cyclic
voltammetry was
carried out using an Autolab PGSTAT20 potentiostat under an argon
atmosphere using a three-electrode arrangement in a single compartment
cell. Glassy carbon was used as the working electrode, platinum wire
as the secondary electrode, and a saturated calomel reference electrode,
chemically isolated from the test solution via a fritted bridge tube
containing electrolyte solution, in the cell. An analyte concentration
of 1 mM was used with [nBu4N][BF4] (400 mM) as the supporting electrolyte. Redox
potentials are referenced to the ferrocenium/ferrocene couple, which
was implemented as an internal reference.35 No compensation was applied for the internal
resistance.

UV/vis spectroelectrochemical measurements were
performed using an optically transparent quartz electrochemical cell,
with a 0.5 mm path length. A three-electrode configuration of a platinum/rhodium
gauze working electrode, platinum wire secondary electrode, and a
saturated calomel reference electrode (chemically isolated via a fritted
bridge tube) were used in the cell. The potential at the working electrode
was regulated with a Sycopel Scientific Ltd DD10M potentiostat, and
the spectra were recorded with a PerkinElmer 16 spectrophotometer.
Temperature control was achieved with a stream of chilled nitrogen
gas (cooled by passing through a tube submerged in liquid nitrogen)
across the surface of the cell, adjusting the flow rate as necessary
in response to a temperature sensor (±0.3 °C). [nBu4N][BF4] (400 mM) was used
as the supporting electrolyte for the experiments.

Bulk electrolysis
was performed under an argon atmosphere at 0
°C in a two-component cell: a platinum/rhodium gauze working
electrode and secondary electrode are separated by a glass frit. A
saturated calomel reference was bridged to the test solution through
a vycor frit, oriented at the center of the working electrode. The
working electrode compartment, containing analyte (1 mM), was stirred
rapidly with a magnetic stir bar during electrolysis. [nBu4N][BF4] (400 mM) was used
as the supporting electrolyte for the experiments. After the electrolysis
was completed, the prepared solution was transferred by cannula to
a Schlenk-adapted quartz EPR tube for analysis at ambient temperature
on a Bruker EMX spectrometer at X-band.

Synthesis
Reactions
sensitive to air and moisture were
performed using a standard Schlenk line, with nitrogen as the inert
atmosphere. Glassware used was flame-dried under vacuum and backfilled
with nitrogen. Compounds 2,6-bis(diphenylmethyl)-4-methylaniline,36 10-(4-aminophenyl)-10H-phenothiazine,31 3,4,9,10-tetra(decyloxycarbonyl)perylene,29 and perylene-3,4-anhydride-9,10-di(decyloxycarbonyl)27 were prepared according to literature methods.

to 100 °C, and then hydrochloric acid (50 mL, 2 M) was added.
After 10 min, the reaction mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature
and extracted with CHCl3 (2 × 100 mL). The combined

and brine (100 mL) and dried over MgSO4. The orange solution
was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the crude product was
purified by column chromatography (silica, 99:1 chloroform/acetone)
to give the product as a red solid (140 mg, 76%, mp = 276 °C).

Synthesis
of N-(2,6-Bis(diphenylmethyl)-4-methylphenyl)-N′-(10-phenyl-10H-4.4.1.12.phenothiazine)-perylene-3,4-imide-9,10-dithioimide
(PDIS2-PTZ)
PDIS0-PTZ (140
mg, 129 μmol) and Lawesson’s reagent (261 mg, 645 μmol)
were dissolved in anhydrous toluene (25 mL) and heated to reflux for
20 h. The solution was cooled to room temperature and washed with
sat. aq NaHCO3 (100 mL), water (100 mL), and sat. aq NaCl
(100 mL); dried over MgSO4; filtered; and the solvent removed
to give a blue solid. The product was purified by column chromatography
(silica, gradient elution from chloroform to 19:1 chloroform/acetone)
to give PDIS2-PTZ as a blue microcrystalline powder (73 mg, 51%, mp = 277 °C).
