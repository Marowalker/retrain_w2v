In this work, numerical simulation
is carried out in a three-dimensional
full-loop pilot-scale circulating fluidized bed to explore the shape
effect of the riser cross section on the typical flow characteristics
of the bed via the multiphase particle-in-cell (MP-PIC) method. The
gas and solid phases are modeled with the large eddy simulation and
Newton’s law of motion in the Eulerian and Lagrangian frameworks,
respectively. The proposed model has been well validated with experimental
data, followed by evaluating the typical core–annulus structure
and the nonuniformity of the solid phase distributed along the radial
and axial directions of the riser. Then, the particle-scale information
of the solid phase distributed in different parts of the system is
explored. The results demonstrate that (i) the square riser gives
rise to a higher solid inventory in the standpipe owing to the stronger
circulation intensity; (ii) the thickness of the solid back-mixing
layer reduces along the riser height; the solid back-mixing tends
to concentrate in the four corners, while it is not obvious near the
sidewalls of the square riser; and (iii) nonuniform distribution of
the particle-scale information of the solid phase (e.g., mass, flux,
drag force, and slip velocity) can be observed. The square riser gives
rise to comparatively more uniform axial mass distribution, a larger
rising solid flux, larger horizontal transportation velocity between
the core and annulus regions, and a larger horizontal dispersion coefficient
in the riser, as compared with the corresponding ones in the circular
riser.

1 Introduction
Circulating fluidized beds (CFBs) have been widely employed in
many industrial applications, such as coal combustion, ore roasting,
biomass gasification, and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), due to their
excellent gas–solid mixing, increased throughput, and excellent
fuel flexibility. A CFB always consists of a riser for gas–solid
processing, a cyclone for separating the bed material, a standpipe
for material inventory, and a loop seal for transporting the particles
into the riser. The geometrical complexity of the CFB gives rise to
the significant distinctive flow characteristics of the gas and solid
phases in the different components of the system and also many operation
difficulties (e.g., agglomeration, gas refluxing, solid back-mixing).
Thus, a detailed understanding of the underlying flow mechanisms behind
the complex flow patterns of the solid phase in the bed is exceptionally
critical for the successful and reliable design, operation, and scale-up
of this kind of apparatus.

Until now, lots of experimental studies
have been conducted to
explore the typical flow structure and important hydrodynamics in
the CFB, such as solid velocity distribution,1 cluster behavior,2 solid circulation
rate,3 polydispersity,4 segregation,5 annulus flow behavior,6 multiple cyclones,7 and internal effects.8

Restricted
by the opaque nature of solid motion in the bed, experimentally
exploring the CFB is often difficult and expensive. During the last
two decades, the significant advancement of computational hardware
has resulted in making numerical simulation a powerful and cost-effective
tool for exploring the dense gas–solid flow in fluidized beds
as it can provide a detailed local gas–solid flow (e.g., solid
concentration, particle-scale information, and gas–solid interactions).
In general, the numerical methods available can be divided into three
types based on the resolution chosen for the solid phase. The first
one is the two-fluid model (TFM), which resolves gas and solid phases
at the computational cell level in the Eulerian–Eulerian framework.9−13 Due to its relatively coarse resolution, the TFM has been widely
adopted for investigating flow characteristics in the CFB, such as
the effect of ring baffle,14 flow behavior
and regime,15 polydispersity,16 cluster property, and flux distribution.17 However, limited by the resolution for the solid
phase, the particle-scale information cannot be obtained through this
method. Another weakness of this approach is its disadvantage of incorporating
the wide particle size distribution.

The second one is computational
fluid dynamics coupled with the
discrete element method (CFD-DEM),18−21 which tracks the solid phase
at the particle-scale level and handles particle collision events
through a soft-sphere collision model.22 However, this high-fidelity numerical method requires numerous computational
resources for tracking the solid phase, and thus the majority of the
available studies have been carried out for small-scale risers of
the CFB with a limited particle number.23−27

The third method is the recently developed
multiphase particle-in-cell
(MP-PIC), which is a Eulerian–Lagrangian model and resolves
the particle collision through the normal stress model.28−30 Compared with the TFM, this approach provides more accurate tracking
of the solid phase and also has the ability to handle the wide particle
size distribution. As compared with the CFD-DEM, this approach resolves
the particle collision through the particle stress gradient instead
of accurately determining the collision process. Thus, the MP-PIC
method can provide a fast solution to the large-scale dense
fluidizing apparatus, becoming more and more popular for modeling
the dense two-phase flow currently.31−35 Lan et al.36 numerically
explored solid back-mixing in a CFB riser with the MP-PIC method and
found that solid back-mixing in the dilute phase transport regime
can be attributed to the downward flow of the solid phase near the
wall. The numerical work conducted by Chen et al.37 demonstrated that the drag force in computational particle
fluid dynamics is overestimated. Shi et al.38 numerically explored the solid residence time in the riser of a
CFB with the MP-PIC method and observed the nonuniform distribution
of solid residence time along the radial and axial directions. Via
the MP-PIC method, Ma et al.39 numerically
simulated a three-dimensional full-loop high-density CFB, and the
results demonstrated that the solid residence time distribution in
the standpipe exhibits a feature of an early peak with an extended
tail.

Although there exist plenty of experimental and numerical
reports
for the gas–solid flow characteristics in the CFB, three aspects
should be highlighted. (i) Many of the past studies have mainly focused
on the riser of the CFB for the purpose of reducing geometrical complexity
and computational cost. The dense gas–solid flow is highly
chaotic and nonlinear, giving rise to the dynamic variation of full-loop
pressure in the apparatus. Thus, only simulating the riser fails to
predict the low-frequency variation of pressure fluctuation in the
bed. Furthermore, only exploring the riser part cannot provide a complete
screen of the flow dynamics in the whole apparatus. The full-loop
simulation of the entire CFB is treated as the most accurate and valuable
approach for the design and optimization of this apparatus. There
was a growing interest in simulating the three-dimensional full-loop
dynamics of the CFB in the past several years.40−43 (ii) As the main part for the
processing of gas–solid flows, the riser geometry among nearly
all of the reports is square or circular. Different riser geometries
result in the appearance of different flow dynamics (e.g., the radial
distribution of the solid phase, the back-mixing intensity), thus
further impacting the system performance of the whole system. Until
now, reports on the effect of riser cross section on the gas–solid
flow characteristics of the CFB have been rare. Only Tu and Wang44 numerically studied the influence of riser geometry
on gas–solid flows in the CFB and found that fluidization was
less disordered in the rectangular riser. In-depth investigation of
the shape effect of the riser cross section on the full-loop gas–solid
flow characteristics in the CFB is essential for the design, optimization,
and scale-up of the CFB. (iii) Owing to the inherent multiscale flow
characteristics of the dense gas–solid flow, deeply exploring
the particle-scale information of the solid phase provides essential
knowledge on the flow dynamics of solid materials in the components
of the CFB. Unfortunately, reports on this kind of information are
extremely limited. The effect of riser geometry on this is still unavailable.

Therefore, the current work was numerically conducted via the MP-PIC
method to simulate the dense gas–solid flow in a pilot-scale
full-loop circulating fluidized bed with the aim of exploring the
effect of riser geometry on the essential flow characteristics in
this apparatus. Specifically, the gas motion is solved with the large
eddy simulation under the Eulerian framework, while the solid phase
is solved with the numerical parcel concept in the Lagrangian framework.
First, the proposed numerical model is validated with the experimental
data, in terms of the radial and axial distributions of the solid
concentration. Then, the shape effect of the riser cross section on
the full-loop characteristics (e.g., gas and solid fluxes, core–annulus
structure, and solid back-mixing) in the CFB is explored, followed
by investigating the nonuniformity of solid properties along the radial
and axial directions of the riser. Finally, the effect of riser shape
on the particle-scale information of the solid phase in different
parts of the CFB is discussed.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 General Full-Loop Behavior of the CFB
Figure 1 gives the
general flow behavior of the solid phase in the CFB with different
shapes of the riser. Particles in the lower part of the riser are
dragged upward by rising gas introduced from the riser bottom. After
the rising process, the particles reach the riser top and then are
directed horizontally by a crossover channel, followed by tangential
injection into the cyclone. Then, the particles spiral downward around
the inner cyclone surface, resulting in the separation of gas and
solid phases in this component. The separated gas exits through the
top of the cyclone, while the particles fall into the standpipe under
the effect of gravity. Gas streams aerated from the bottom of the
standpipe transport the solid material into the riser, and then a
full-loop cycle of the solid material is completed. This cycle keeps
repeating; thus, a continuous circulation of the solid phase around
the CFB loop is established.

Figure 1 General flow behavior of the solid phase in
the full-loop CFB (the
left represents the square case, while the right represents the circular
case for each pair), t = 30 s: (a) particle volume
fraction (pVol); (b) X-component particle velocity
(Usx, m/s); (c) Z-component particle velocity (Usz,
m/s).

As illustrated in Figure 1a, the height of the solid
inventory in the standpipe of the
square-shaped CFB is higher compared with that in the circular one
because the square riser has a stronger circulation intensity of particles.
The fundamental reasons for this phenomenon can be explained via the
particle-scale characteristics of the solid phase, which will be given
in the following sections. It is noted that the circular riser has
a higher solid concentration compared with the square one. As presented
in Figure 1b, the particles
are chaotic in the dense region of the riser, demonstrating the drastic
gas–particle interaction intensity. Particles have positive
horizontal velocities (Usx) in the top channel between the riser exit
and the cyclone entrance and negative horizontal velocities in the
incline part of the loop seal. It is noted from Figure 1c that the axial particle velocity (Usz)
is negative in the circular riser, indicating that the solid back-mixing
phenomenon takes place. In the square riser, particles rise and leave
with intense kinetic energy, leading to a stronger circulation intensity
of particles than that in the circular riser.

2.2 Effect
of Riser Shape on Flux Distribution
Gas and solid fluxes
in the CFB are the key parameters to assess
gas and solid transport intensities, which should be thoroughly investigated. Figure 2 shows gas and solid
fluxes in the central slice (y/Y = 0) of the CFB with different riser shapes. x, y, and z represent the dimensions along
width, depth, and height, respectively. The gas or solid flux is a
combination of gas/particle density, gas/particle volume fraction,
and gas/particle velocity.24 In general,
the axial gas and solid fluxes are 1 order of magnitude larger than
the radial ones. Besides, the solid flux is about 10 times larger
than the gas flux.

Figure 2 Gas and solid fluxes in the center slice (y/Y = 0) of the full-loop CFB: (a) square riser;
(b) circular
riser.

Gas flow spirals downward around
the inner surface of the cyclone
and moves upward in the core region of the cyclone. The square riser
gives a more drastic secondary flow under the vortex finder and wake
vortex in the lower part of the cyclone. For the Y-component gas flux (Gg_y), it is noted that the
center of flow is not in coincidence with the axis of the cyclone.
This flow pattern of the gas phase is defined as the “fishing
tail” phenomenon, which has been proved by plenty of experiments
and simulations.45−48 In contrast to the gas flow, particles spin around the cyclone wall
and are separated into the standpipe. It is clearly observed that
the axial gas flux (Gg_z) and the axial solid flux
(Gs_z) are quite different between the square riser
and the circular one. Specifically, many particles fall back around
the periphery of the circular riser, while a small number of particles
resides in the sidewalls of the square riser. To illuminate this phenomenon,
a specific cross section located at the height of z/Z = 0.5 of the riser is extracted with the axial
gas and solid fluxes presented in Figure 3. It is noted that the axial gas flux is
significant in the core region and small in the four corners of the
square riser. However, the axial solid flux pattern is not symmetric,
ascribed to the introduction of auxiliary gas flow from the left side
of the riser (x/R = 0), which causes
the nonuniform distribution of gas–solid flow. For the circular
riser, the gas flux shows a hatlike pattern with a large value in
the core and a small value in the periphery. Attributed to the single-side
introduction of auxiliary gas flow, particles tend to back-mix near
the left-side wall (x/X = 0).

Figure 3 Axial gas and
solid fluxes in a specific cross section with the
height of z/Z = 0.5, where r represents the dimensions along the X or Y directions: (a, b) axial gas flux (Gg_z) and axial solid flux (Gs_z) in the square
riser; (c, d) axial gas and solid fluxes in the circular riser.

2.3 Effect of Riser Shape on
the Core–Annulus
Structure
Figure 4 shows the profiles of the solid volume fraction in two perpendicular
lines (i.e., X-line and Y-line)
passing through the center of cross sections (slice z = 1.0, 3.0, and 5.0 m) with different bed heights. In general, the
profiles of the solid volume fraction present a parabolic curve pattern.
Due to the single-side refeed structure, the profiles of the X-line are unsymmetrical, which are more evident in the
square riser. The solid volume fraction is lower in the left side
of the riser where the auxiliary gas flow is introduced. However,
the profiles of the Y-line are symmetric, even if
they are just above the recycling port of the riser (Figure 4a,d). The difference between
the X-line and Y-line is slight
in the core region and significant in the annulus region. Thus, the
radial particle concentration is comparatively low in the central
core region and increases sharply near the wall in the riser, which
represents the so-called typical core–annulus structure. The
core–annulus structure mainly results from the solid back-mixing
phenomenon in the riser. It is noted that the solid back-mixing intensity
and the thickness of the solid back-mixing layer are reduced along
the riser height. At any height, the solid volume fraction is lower
in the square riser than that in the circular one. Interestingly,
it is noted that solid back-mixing tends to concentrate in the four
corners of the square riser, while it is not obvious far away from
this region, which is demonstrated in the experiment and called the
“wall-sheltering” phenomenon.49

Figure 4 Radial
particle solid volume fraction in the cross sections with
different heights of the riser: (a–c) square riser with slice z = 1.0, 3.0, and 5.0 m; (d–f) circular riser with
slice z = 1.0, 3.0, and 5.0 m.

Figure 5 gives the
surface plots of the solid volume fraction in the vertical cross section
(slice x/X = 0). It is noted that
the solid volume fraction decreases as the height increases. The core–annulus
structure is observed along the whole riser, which diminishes along
the bed height. The change of solid volume fraction in the circular
riser is more significant than that in the square riser, which is
large in the bottom (z < 1.0 m) and the top (z > 6.0 m) of the riser. The former tendency is because
of the dense region where particle agglomeration occurs. The latter
is due to the “L-type” abrupt exit, which makes particles
accumulate in the top region.

Figure 5 Surface plots of the solid volume fraction in
the vertical cross
section (slice x/X = 0) of the riser:
(a) square riser; (b) circular riser.

The centerline from the vertical cross section is extracted to
quantitatively compare the solid volume fraction between the square
riser and the circular riser. As presented in Figure 6, the solid volume fraction in the bed bottom
first increases to a maximum value and then decreases along the bed
height and finally rises in the bed ceiling. The maximum value for
the square riser is about 0.09, while for the circular riser it is
about 0.18. In the lower region, the circular riser gives rises to
a larger solid volume fraction. In the developed region (3.0 m < z < 5.0 m), the shape of the riser has a slight influence
on solid volume fraction distribution.

Figure 6 Axial distribution of
the solid volume fraction in the riser with
a different shape.

2.4 Axial
Mass Distribution
The typical
characteristics of the solid phase in the riser are the presence of
the nonuniform distribution of the solid phase along the radial and
axial directions. The mass distribution in the bed is extremely critical
for successful operation and also performance improvement as this
parameter is strongly related to the heat transfer and the reaction
behavior inside the riser. To explore the nonuniformity along the
axial direction, the fraction distribution of the total mass combined
with the rising and falling mass along the axial direction is evaluated.
Specifically, the riser is uniformly divided into 100 sections along
the axial direction, followed by evaluating the mass fraction of the
solid phase distributed in each region with regard to the total mass
in the riser.

Figure 7a illustrates the mass fraction of the total mass distributed
in the riser. The largest mass fraction of the solid phase appears
in the bottom region of the riser, which is attributed to the addition
of the circulating particles transported from the loop seal. Along
the bed height, the decreasing mass of the solid phase reflects the
dilute distribution of the particles, which is due to the fact that
many of the particles dragged by the rising gas continuously fall
back along the axial direction. The apparent large mass of the solid
phase near the riser outlet results from the strong back-mixing of
the rising particles after colliding with the riser top. Compared
with the square riser, a larger mass fraction of the solid phase appears
in the lower part of the circular riser, demonstrating more vigorous
nonuniformity of the mass distribution of the solid phase along the
axial direction in the circular riser.

Figure 7 Shape effect of the riser
cross section on the axial distribution
of the solid mass in the riser of the CFB. (a) Fraction distribution
of the total mass in the riser; (b) fraction distribution of the rising
and falling particles in the riser.

In the riser, many of the particles rise upward while others fall
downward near the riser wall. To quantitatively reflect the distribution
characteristics of the rising and falling particles in the riser, Figure 7b presents the axial
distribution of the mass fraction of the rising and falling mass along
the bed height. Continuous decrease of the rising and falling mass
of particles can be observed along the axial direction, reflecting
the more and more dilute distribution of particles in the upper part
of the bed. Steep distribution of the mass fraction appears for the
CFB with a circular riser, demonstrating that more significant nonuniformity
of the rising and falling mass of particles can be observed for the
circular riser. As expected, the vigorous falling mass of the solid
phase exists near the riser top due to the restriction effect of the
abrupt exit on the particle flow.

2.5 Rising
and Back-Mixing Intensity
The solid back-mixing significantly
impacts the performance of the
CFB as this has a strong relationship with the reaction process underway,
the reaction rate, and also the solid residence time. In this work,
solid flux is adopted to quantitatively evaluate the flow intensity
of the rising and falling behavior of the solid phase in the bed. Figure 8 quantitatively presents
the spatial distribution of the flux fraction of the rising and falling
fluxes of the solid phase along the radial (a) and vertical (b) directions
of the CFB with different riser cross sections. Specifically, the
radial and axial distributions of the solid flux are obtained by horizontally
dividing the riser into 10 and 100 parts along these two directions,
respectively. Then, the time-averaged rising and falling fluxes of
the solid phase in each part are obtained, followed by calculating
the total flux magnitude of the solid phase in each part. Subsequently,
the fraction of the rising and falling fluxes in each part can be
obtained by dividing the total flux magnitude in this region.

Figure 8 Shape effect
of the riser cross section on the radial (a) and axial
(b) distributions of the rising and falling fluxes of the solid phase
in the riser of the CFB.

Figure 8a illustrates
the radial distribution of the flux fraction of the rising and falling
particles in the riser. For these two systems, the nonuniform radial
distribution of both the rising and falling solid fluxes can be observed.
The rising solid flux mainly appears in the central region as the
rising particles are dragged by the rising gas flow. Significant falling
solid flux appears in the near-wall region, which corresponds to the
vigorous solid back-mixing in this region. Furthermore, the asymmetrical
distribution of the solid flux is mainly due to the one-side return
of the bed material. As compared with the circular riser, the flux
fraction of the rising particles is larger in the square one, while
the falling flux fraction is more significant for the circular riser,
especially in the near-wall region. Along the axial direction (Figure 8b), the mass fraction
of the rising solid flux to the total flux magnitude continuously
increases, while the solid back-mixing intensity continuously decreases
along the bed height. Although the masses of both the rising and falling
particles continuously decrease along the axial direction, the variation
tendency is more significant for the falling particles. An intense
falling flux of the solid phase appears in the bottom part of the
bed. As compared with the circular riser, the square riser gives rise
to a larger fraction of rising solid flux along the axial direction.

2.6 Radial and Axial Distribution of Solid Information
Tracking the solid phase in the Lagrangian framework provides the
possibility of evaluating the solid property in a specific region.
The horizontal motion of the solid phase pushes the particles from
the central region to the riser wall. Similar to the method chosen
for the mass distribution, the whole domain is divided into 10 and
100 parts along the radial and axial directions, respectively, to
evaluate the lateral and vertical distributions of the solid phase.

Figure 9 presents
the radial (a) and axial (b) distributions of the magnitudes of the
horizontal (Usx) and axial (Usz) velocities of particles in the riser
of the CFB. Obvious nonuniform distribution of solid velocity appears
along both the radial and axial directions. Along the radial direction
(Figure 9a), the horizontal
velocity of the solid phase is the largest in the central region of
the riser and continuously decreases along the radial direction. The
horizontal transportation velocity is nearly 1 order of magnitude
smaller than the vertical one. Meanwhile, the largest vertical solid
velocity appears in the central part of the bed. The riser shape does
not obviously alter the general patterns of the distribution pattern.
However, the square riser gives rise to a large horizontal velocity
along the radial direction, demonstrating its effect of enhancing
the solid exchanging velocity between the core and annulus regions. Figure 9b shows the axial
distribution of the sectional-averaged horizontal and axial velocities
of particles. The largest horizontal solid velocity appearing in the
lower part of the bed mainly results from the effect of the horizontal
particle stream introduced from the loop seal. Along the axial direction,
the horizontal velocity sharply decreases in the lower part but smoothly
in the upper region of the bed. Near the riser exit, the noticeable
large horizontal solid velocity results from the horizontal transportation
of particles from the riser exit. Regarding the axial solid velocity,
continuous increases of the solid velocity along the bed height exist,
which is mainly due to the acceleration effect of the rising gas phase.
After being fully accelerated, the decrease of solid velocity in the
region near the riser top is attributed to the intensive collision
of the rising particles with the falling ones, restricted by the riser
top. Obviously, the riser shape does not change the distribution tendency
of both the radial and axial solid velocities but gives rise to a
minor difference for both the velocities along the axial direction.

Figure 9 Shape
effect of the riser cross section on the radial (a) and axial
(b) distributions of the particle-scale averaged solid horizontal
and vertical velocities in the riser of the CFB.

In the riser, the slip velocity affects the gas–solid heat
transfer and also the drag force exerted on the solid phase. The drag
force strongly affects the solid transport and the internal circulation
of the solid phase in the system. In the literature, there exist empirical
correlations for the one-dimensional (1D) analysis of the slip factor
and drag force50 and also the utilization
of the slip velocity for determining the solid residence time.51Figure 10 presents the radial (a) and axial (b) distributions of the
drag force and slip velocity of the solid phase, which are calculated
as the sectional-averaged particle-scale information of the solid
phase. Nonuniform distribution of the slip velocity appears along
the radial direction (Figure 10a), with the appearance of large slip velocity in the central
core region of the riser and small ones near the sidewalls of the
bed. Large slip velocity in the central core region results from the
large gas velocity in this part. Near the riser wall, the wall restriction
on the gas flow gives rise to a comparatively smaller slip velocity
in this region. Along the axial direction, the slip velocity in the
square riser is obviously larger than that of the circular riser.
Moreover, along both the radial and axial directions, a similar distribution
tendency of the slip velocity appears for the CFB with different risers.
The square riser gives rise to a larger slip velocity along the radial
direction of the riser, as compared with the circular riser. However,
the circular riser gives rise to a larger drag force on the particles
along the radial direction, and also in the lower part of the riser,
as compared with the square riser. The inconsistency of the drag force
with the slip velocity is due to the fact that the drag force is determined
by several factors despite the slip velocity.

on the radial (a) and axial (b) distributions
of the sectional-averaged drag force and the slip velocity of the
solid phase in the riser of the CFB.

2.7 Comparison of Particle-Scale Information in
Components
The complex geometry of the CFB gives rise to
different flow characteristics of both the gas and solid phases in
different components of the system. To give a general comparison of
the solid motion, the time-averaged information of the solid phase
evaluated through the particle-scale level is provided in Table 1.

Riser Shapes

Several tips can be obtained. (i)
The axial solid velocity in the
riser is obviously larger than the horizontal one. However, the solid
velocity along three directions is at the same magnitude scale in
the cyclone. Extremely small solid velocity exists in the standpipe.
As compared with the square riser, the circular riser gives rise to
a larger horizontal solid velocity but a smaller axial one for the
solid motion in both the riser and cyclone. (ii) Among the three components
of the riser, the drag force, the particle Reynolds number, and the
slip velocity of the solid phase in the riser are the largest, followed
by the cyclone, and finally the standpipe. The circular riser gives
rise to a larger slip velocity and drag force in the riser, as compared
with the square one. (iii) The axial dispersion intensity of the solid
phase in the riser is extremely larger than the horizontal one for
both CFBs investigated. However, the horizontal dispersion intensity
of the solid phase is the largest due to the spiral flow of particles
along the cyclone’s inner surface. The weakest dispersion of
the solid phase in the standpipe can be observed. As compared with
the circular riser, the horizontal dispersion intensity of the solid
phase is slightly larger than that in the square riser, reflecting
the enhanced horizontal transportation of the solid material between
the core and annulus regions of the riser. However, the axial dispersion
intensity of the solid phase in the square riser is smaller than that
in the circular one.

3 Conclusions
Based
on the multiphase particle-in-cell method, the full-loop
gas–solid flow in a three-dimensional circulating fluidized
bed is numerically simulated. After validating the numerical results
with experimental data, the effect of riser shape on the typical gas–solid
hydrodynamics (e.g., the core–annulus structure and the nonuniform
distribution property) in the bed is explored. Furthermore, the radial
and axial distributions of the particle-scale information of the solid
phase in the riser are comparatively investigated. Based on the numerical
results, the following tips can be drawn.(1) The square riser gives rise to a higher
solid inventory in the standpipe, owing to the stronger circulation
intensity in the square riser, as compared with that in the circular
one. Solid back-mixing occurs in the periphery of the circular riser,
and the thickness of the solid back-mixing layer reduces along the
riser height. Interestingly, the solid back-mixing tends to concentrate
in the four corners, while it is not obvious near the sidewalls of
the square riser. As compared with the circular riser, the square
riser gives rise to a smaller mass fraction distributed in the lower
part and a comparatively uniform distribution of the solid mass combined
with the rising and falling mass fractions along the axial direction.

rise to a larger
rising solid flux along the axial direction. Nonuniform distribution
of the particle-scale information of the solid phase (velocity, slip
velocity) in the riser along the radial and axial directions can be
observed. The riser shape does not obviously alter the general distribution
pattern along both directions. The square riser results in a large
horizontal transportation velocity between the core and annulus regions
and a smaller drag force on the solid phase.

(3) The largest drag and slip velocity
of the solid phase can be observed in the riser, followed by the cyclone.
The square riser results in a larger horizontal velocity and a horizontal
dispersion coefficient of the solid phase in the riser.



In view of the inherent complex gas–solid flow
hydrodynamics
of the CFB, the study regarding the effect of riser geometry on the
gas–solid hydrodynamics in the CFB operating with different
parameters (e.g., the superficial velocity, the particle diameter,
the aeration velocity of the L-valve) will be the focus of our following
work. In general, the insights emanating from this study are expected
to be valuable for the in-depth understanding of the extremely complex
and critical hydrodynamic behaviors of both the gas and solid phases
in the full-loop circulating fluidized bed, further contributing to
the design and optimization of a high-efficiency large-scale commercial
system in practical industrial applications.

4 Numerical
Methods and Settings
4.1 Mathematical Model
The gas phase
is treated as a continuous medium, and its motion is tracked at the
computational cell scale in the Eulerian framework. The governing
equations for gas continuity and momentum can be formulated as 1   2  

where εg, ρg, ug, and pg denote
the voidage, density, velocity, and pressure of the gas phase, respectively. t and g are the time instant
and gravitational acceleration, respectively. Fgs represents the gas–solid momentum exchange rate per
unit volume and will be discussed later. τg is the
gas stress tensor, for which the constitutive equation can be formulated
as 3  

Here, μg stands for the shear
viscosity of the
gas phase, which consists of the laminar viscosity and the turbulent
viscosity. In this work, the turbulent viscosity is modeled through
the Smagorinsky model52 described as 4  where Cs (=0.01)
is the Smagorinsky constant. Δ represents the filter scale evaluated
as 5  where Δx, Δy, and Δz are the
size length of
the computational cell along the x, y, and z directions, respectively. Compared with
the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) or laminar models,
the Smagorinsky model of LES gives rise to a more accurate calculation
for velocity and pressure of the gas phase in each grid node, leading
to a more accurate drag force. Moreover, this model has been widely
used to model dense gas–solid flows in fluidized beds.24,53−59

In the MP-PIC method, the numerical parcel, which contains
a number
of physical particles with the same properties (e.g., size, density)
at the same location, is chosen for the solid phase to significantly
reduce the particle number tracked. Thus, the solid motion is tracked
with the help of the introduction of the particle distribution function
(PDF) fs,29,60 which is a
function of the particle spatial location xs, the particle velocity us, particle density ρs, and time t. Specifically, fs(xs, us, ρs, Vs, t)dusdρsdVs represents the average number of particles per unit
volume within the velocity interval (us, us + dus), volume interval (Vs, Vs + dVs), and density interval
(ρs, ρs + dρs)
at the time instant t. The transport equation for
the PDF fs can be formulated as 6  where fD and τD are
the PDFs for the local mass-averaged particle velocity
and collision damping time, respectively, and the details can be found
in the literature.29,61 Γs is the particle
acceleration due to the aerodynamic drag, the pressure gradient, the
gravity, and the interphase interactions, which can be given as61 7  where τs is the particle
normal stress adopted to model the collision force acting on a numerical
particle. It is evaluated through the Harris and Crighton model,62 which is expressed as 8  where Ps, εcs, and γ are the model parameters. α
is a minimum
value chosen to remove the singularity at the close-packing state
of the solid phase. εs in eq 7 is the solid concentration, which can be
evaluated from the PDF fs as 9  

β in eq 7 represents
the interphase momentum exchanging coefficient evaluated with a combination
of the Wen–Yu63 and Ergun64 drag models. It can be formulated as 10   11   12   13  where ds stands
for the particle diameter.

The interphase momentum exchanging
rate Fgs, which is related to the particle
probability distribution
function, can be expressed as 14  

4.2 Numerical Validation
The simulation
is carried out on the platform of the open-source software package
OpenFOAM, in which the MP-PIC solver (i.e., MPPICFoam) is available.
The MP-MPIC method used in the present work is validated with the
experimental data from a pilot-scale cold CFB apparatus,65 which has a rectangular riser with a cross-section
area of 1000 mm × 300 mm. The height of the riser is 8.5 m, and
the exit is L-type abrupt. For simplification, the external circulation
system is omitted in the simulation, which is virtually represented
by a boundary condition connection technique. Specifically, all particles
escaped from the riser exit are automatically returned from the junction
of the loop seal and riser, which has a cross-section area of 177
mm × 177 mm and an angle of 45°. Moreover, the particles
are assumed to be 100% recycled to maintain a constant particle inventory
during the whole simulation. Sand is used as the bed material, which
has a density of 2600 kg/m3 and a surface mean diameter
of 140 μm. Gas flow is introduced from the bottom distributor
with a superficial gas velocity of 4.0 m/s. The density and viscosity
of the gas are 1.18 kg/m3 and 1.5 × 10–5 kg/(s·m), respectively. The grid size along the width, depth,
and height is, respectively, assigned as 35 mm × 22.5 mm ×
55 mm, which has been proved to be reasonable by Hartge et al.66 The details of operating parameters can be found
in the literature.37

The experimental
data available in Schlichthärle65 is quite limited. Only the axial solid volume fraction along the
riser height is presented. It is noted from Figure 11a that the numerical results agree well
with the experimental data along the bed height, especially in the
medium and upper parts (i.e., z > 3.0 m). The
reason
is that the medium and upper parts of the riser are dilute suspension
regions, where the homogeneous gas–solid flow is suitable to
be described using the Wen–Yu and Ergun drag model. In contrast,
the lower part of the riser (i.e., z < 3.0 m)
is a dense region, where the heterogeneous gas–solid flow should
be captured using the advanced drag model with heterogeneity considered,
such as the EMMS drag model.67 Therefore,
there is a slight discrepancy between numerical results and experimental
data in the lower part of the riser. However, this discrepancy is
acceptable in the pilot-scale CFB simulations to some extent. In the
experiment, the solid inventory and pressure drop are set, and the
external solid mass flux (Gs) is 20 kg/(s·m2).37,65,66 As illustrated in Figure 11b, the external solid mass
flux obtained from the simulation fluctuates around a mean value of
18.9 kg/(s·m2), which is in accordance with the experimental
data of 20 kg/(s·m2).

Figure 11 Comparison of the current
simulation and experimental data:65 (a)
axial solid volume fraction along the central
line; and (b) solid external mass flux over time.

In summary, the proposed MP-PIC method is reliable and reasonable
to investigate gas–solid flow characteristics in the three-dimensional
full-loop CFB.

4.3 Numerical Settings
A three-dimensional
CFB model is built according to the experimental test rig.68 The CFB is extracted from a 0.3 MWth pilot plant system, which includes three main parts: (i) feeding
system; (ii) primary and secondary gas flow; and (iii) external circulation
system including a cyclone and a recycling system. For the feeding
system, a rotating screw feeder is used to control the feed rate of
solid fuels. The current work focuses on cold gas–solid hydrodynamics
in the CFB; thus, the process of feeding solid fuels is neglected.
The air supplying system provides primary and secondary air to the
CFB, which is composed of a compressor, the main valve, and two flowmeters.
The primary air is introduced from the distributor located at the
bottom of the riser to fluidize the bed materials, while the secondary
air is fed into the system to assist in the solid circulation and
control the equivalent ratio. The heart of the plant system is a CFB
with a total height of 6500 mm, as shown in Figure 12. X, Y, and Z represent the directions along the width,
depth, and height of the CFB, respectively. The origin of the coordinates
is the center of circular and square cross sections. In the experiment,
the cross section of the riser is circular with a diameter of 200
mm. To explore the shape effect on the full-loop gas–solid
flow dynamics, a square riser is adopted with the same cross-section
area as the circular one. Thus, the side length of the square cross
section is 177 mm. The cyclone with a diameter of 350 mm separates
particles from gas–solid flows. The standpipe with a diameter
of 120 mm is used to store solid materials. The computational domain
of the CFB with a circular and square riser is divided into 142 576
and 147 840 grid elements, respectively. Besides, the number
of parcels is 105 679 and 101 775 for the circular system
and square system, respectively.

Figure 12 Schematic diagram of geometry and grids
toward the investigated
CFB with different riser shapes.

The primary air is introduced into the riser with a superficial
gas velocity (Ug) of 7.0 m/s and a temperature
of 298 K. The auxiliary air is provided from the feed inlet, which
is located 370 mm above the bottom distributor with a mass flow rate
(Q2) of 0.04 kg/s. The aeration air is
introduced from the bottom of the loop seal to loosen and transport
the particles to the riser, whose mass flow rate (Qr) is 0.04 kg/s. The particle diameter and density are
488 μm and 2600 kg/m3, respectively. Details of gas–solid
properties and operating parameters are listed in Table 2.

Table 2 Details
of Gas–Solid Properties
and Operating Parameters Used in the Current Work
parameter	value	
Solid Phase (Sand)	
diameter (μm)	488	
density (kg/m3)	2600	
close-packing volume fraction	0.60	
restitution coefficient	0.95	
Gas Phase (Air)	
density (kg/m3)	1.205	
viscosity (kg/(s·m))	1.8 × 10–5	
temperature (K)	298	
superficial gas velocity (Ug, m/s)	7.0	
auxiliary gas flow rate (Q2, kg/s)	0.04	
aeration gas flow rate (Qr, kg/s)	0.04	
For the velocity, the primary, auxiliary, and aeration
inlets are
assigned as a velocity/mass flow boundary condition, while the top
of the vortex finder (i.e., outlet) is set as a zero-gradient boundary
condition. Besides, the walls are set as a no-slip boundary condition.
For the pressure, the outlet is assigned as a fixed pressure boundary
condition, 1.01 × 105 Pa. The simulation is focused
on the cold model of the CFB without chemical reactions. Thus, the
time step can be large enough to complete a fast calculation. In the
present simulation, the time step is set as 5.0 × 10–4 s and the particles are first packed in the bottom of the riser,
loop seal, and standpipe with an initial solid volume fraction of
0.56.
