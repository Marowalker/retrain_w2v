An inorganic–organic hybrid
material, MCM-allylCalix, was
synthesized by covalent modification of an MCM-41 surface with a tetra-allyl
calixarene conjugate. The synthesized hybrid was characterized by 13C and 29Si MAS–NMR, Fourier transform infrared
(FT-IR), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area, thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses.
The application of this MCM-allylCalix hybrid has been demonstrated
for loading and in vitro release of doxorubicin (Dox) in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) buffer as well as in the cancer cells, viz., MCF7, HeLa,
and MDA-MB231. The Dox-loaded hybrid, MCM-allylCalix-Dox, was characterized
by TEM, FT-IR, TGA, N2 sorption, diffuse refectance spectroscopy–UV,
and fluorescence microscopy to confirm the presence of the drug. The
release study of the drug from MCM-allylCalix-Dox was carried out
in PBS buffer at pH 5 and 7.4. The results showed ∼140% increase
in the release of Dox at pH 5 compared to that at pH 7.4 in 144 h,
suggesting a pH-triggered release of the drug. MCM-allylCalix-Dox
releases a greater amount of Dox compared to that released from unmodified
MCM-Dox. Cytotoxicity studies suggested that MCM-allylCalix-Dox exhibits
anticancer activity that is dependent on the nature of the cell. The
Dox-loaded hybrid shows more cytotoxicity for MCF7 compared to that
for the HeLa and MDA-MB231 cells. This was further supported by ∼120%
more internalization of Dox into MCF7 cells compared to that in the
other two cell lines. Both fluorescence microscopy and fluorescence-activated
cell sorting studies suggested concentration-dependent internalization
of Dox into the MCF7 and HeLa cells. The results suggested that the
inorganic–organic hybrid can be useful in sustained drug delivery
into cancer cells.

Introduction
Mesoporous materials
are the subject of increasing numbers of publications
currently in the literature in view of their utility in different
fields, such as sensing,1,2 catalysis,3,4 adsorption/separation,5 nanomedicine,
and drug delivery.6 This is because of
their superior properties, such as large surface area, high pore volume,
tunable pore size, and easily modifiable outer surface.4 Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) have shown
great potential as a drug delivery vehicle due to their mesoporous
structure, surface functionality, biocompatibility, high drug loading
capacity, and capacity to withstand external response, such as mechanical
stress and so on.6 A drug delivery system
will be considered versatile if it can deliver precise quantities
of drug to the targeted cells or tissues in a controlled manner to
enhance drug efficiency. MSNs have indeed shown such properties.7,8 Additional advantages of such materials include scaling up of the
synthesis to meet commercial demands and easy clearance from the body.9 In addition, the presence of silanol groups in
these materials allows them to be functionalized with different organic
groups, which will in turn result in a greater affinity to bind to
drugs.10 Having seen the positive outcome
of such systems in drug delivery, it is worth investing efforts further
on their fine-tuning. Such fine-tuning can be achieved by the covalent
modification between the organic molecule and the mesoporous silica
matrix. To perform such covalent modification, we have chosen macrocyclic
calixarene for a number of reasons: (i) amphiphilic nature, (ii) presence
of aromatic cavity, (iii) easy organic modifiability, (iv) dominance
in host–guest chemistry, and (v) as receptors for ions and
molecules.11−13 Indeed, our group played a pivotal role in all of
these studies.14−17 Therefore, the combination of mesoporous silica materials in covalent
conjugation with calixarenes can lead to a new class of materials,
which will exhibit the advantages of both the precursors. Only a limited
number of such materials were reported with different properties,
such as sensing,18 adsorption of metal
ions19−23 and molecules,24,25 removal of pollutants,26−29 and catalysis.30−34 In the literature, few calixarene conjugates were shown to act as
gatekeepers in drug loading and release.35,36 It is interesting to see the applicability of mesoporous silica
functionalized with an organic calixarene host for the loading and
release of drug into cancer cells.

Therefore, this article deals
with covalently functionalized MCM-41
with the tetra-allyl derivative of calix[4]arene to result in a silica–calix
hybrid (MCM-allylCalix) and was characterized by spectroscopy and
microscopy. The textural properties were characterized by transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area analysis. In the present study, doxorubicin (Dox)
has been chosen because of its wide utility in the treatment of different
types of cancers and its red fluorescence emission, which will help
track its localization in cells. The MCM-allylCalix hybrid has been
further demonstrated for its storage and release of Dox in solution
and its controlled release in different types of cancer cells using
fluorescence microscopy and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)
studies.

Results and Discussion
Development of Covalently Modified Mesoporous
Silica (MCM-allylCalix)
and Its Precursors
The upper-rim tetra-allyl derivative of
calix[4]arene (allylCalix) was synthesized in three steps starting
from p-tert-butyl calix[4]arene,
as given in Scheme 1, and was characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR,
and electrospray ionization mass spectrometer (ESI-MS). The allyCalix
was shown to be in cone conformation based on the bridge −CH2 proton signals. MCM-41 was synthesized and characterized
as reported in the literature37 before
making its covalent conjugate product with allylCalix to result in
MCM-allylCalix in the presence of (3-glycidyloxypropyl)trimethoxysilane
(GPTMS). The MCM-allylCalix was characterized by thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), BET surface area, 29Si and 13C MAS–NMR, and TEM.

(i) Anhydrous AlCl3, phenol, toluene, room temperature,
8 h; (ii) NaH/tetrahydrofuran
(THF), CH2=CHCH2Br, N2 atmosphere,

N2 atmosphere, 210 °C, 6 h; (iv) GPTMS, toluene, N2 atmosphere, 80 °C, 15 h; (v) MCM-41, 110 °C, 48
h.

In TGA (Figure 1a), MCM-41 showed an initial weight loss
of 4.4% up to 100 °C
because of the loss of adsorbed water. This is followed by a gradual
weight loss above 290 °C because of the condensation of silanol
groups to form siloxane bonds. The allyCalix showed a 68% decrease
in weight up to 700 °C under a N2 atmosphere because
of the combustion of calixarene. The silica–calix hybrid (MCM-allylCalix)
shows an additional weight loss of ∼12.2% at 700 °C because
of the loss of organic functionality. This resulted in the weight
fraction of allylCalix in the hybrid as ∼18%.

a N2 atmosphere. (b) N2 sorption isotherms at
77 K. (c) FT-IR spectra. Color code: MCM-41,
blue; allylCalix, red; and MCM-allylCalix, green.

In the hybrid, MCM-allylCalix, MCM-41 was covalently functionalized
by the calixarene derivative so as to block the pores partly. This
has been supported by BET measurements (Figure 1b), which show about 64% blocking of the
surface area, that is, the surface area of 628 m2/g in
MCM-41 decreases to 222 m2/g in the hybrid. The pore width
of MCM-41 was 6.5 nm, which was eventually reduced to 1.5 nm after
the incorporation of allylCalix, suggesting significant covalent functionalization
of MCM-41 by allylCalix. All of the nitrogen isotherms are of type
(IV) in nature. The adsorption branch of each isotherm displayed a
sharp inflection, suggesting a typical capillary condensation inside
the uniform pores within the relative pressure range of 0.6–1
(P/Po). The observed
surface area and the pore diameter of the hybrid suggest that there
is sufficient amount of nanospace available for carrying out the drug
delivery application even after introducing the calixarene moiety.

The FT-IR spectra of well-dried and quantitative samples, viz.,
MCM-41, MCM-allylCalix, and allylCalix, are shown in Figure 1c. The FT-IR spectra of MCM-41
showed bands corresponding to asymmetric, symmetric, and bending vibrations
for the Si–O–Si moiety, respectively, at 1000–1300
(broad), 808, and 470 cm–1. The −OH stretching
vibrations of water and Si–OH were observed as broad absorptions
centered at 3434 cm–1, whereas their bending vibrations
were observed at 1635 and 965 cm–1, respectively.
The FT-IR spectrum of the MCM-allylCalix hybrid also exhibited all
of the bands corresponding to MCM-41. The new vibrational bands observed
at 2935 and 2878 cm–1 are attributed to the asymmetric
and symmetric stretching vibrations of −CH2 moieties
present in the covalently modified calixarene counterpart. The broad
band observed in the 3000–3700 cm–1 region
is due to the −OH of the silanol groups of MCM-41 and those
from the calixarene part. The width and area under the −OH
stretching vibrational band of the MCM-allylCalix hybrid are dramatically
decreased compared to those of MCM-41 and allylCalix, suggesting the
condensation of several of the −OH groups when the hybrid is
formed. The −OH stretching band position is shifted from 3153
to 3405 cm–1 on going from allylCalix to the hybrid,
suggesting a significant decrease in free −OH moieties.

The 13C MAS–NMR spectra of the MCM-allylCalix
(Figure 2a) showed
peaks corresponding to methylene (32 and 38 ppm), allyl (110–122
ppm), and aromatic (128–153 ppm) carbons of the allylCalix
derivative. These are marginally downfield shifted as compared to
those of the free allylCalix derivative. The 29Si MAS–NMR
spectra of the MCM-allylCalix show the presence of a broad envelop
in the −107 to −120 ppm region supporting the inorganic
silica species, such as Q2 (−112 ppm), Q3 (−115 ppm), and Q4 (−118 ppm), as given
in Figure 2b. The two
other signals appearing at −69 and −67 ppm correspond
to the T2 and T3 functionalities on the silicon
arising from [(−OSi)2Si(R)(OH)] and [(−OSi)3Si(R)], respectively. The peaks corresponding to the “T”
species support the covalent modification of silica by the organic
calixarene conjugate. Thus, the FT-IR, 13C, and 29Si MAS–NMR data confirm the presence of an intact calixarene
conjugate linked covalently to the surface silanol groups of MCM-41.

and MCM-allylCalix (upper). (b) 29Si MAS–NMR spectra
of MCM-allylCalix. The coordination cores, e.g., Q2, Q3, and Q4 and T2 and T3, are
shown in the upper half.

The TEM images of MCM-41 and the MCM-allylCalix hybrid are
given
in Figure 3. The mesoporous
silica nanoparticles of MCM-41 are spherical and well-dispersed with
an average size of 120–140 nm with two-dimensional ordering
in mesoporous channels, which are characteristic of MCM-41 (Figure 3a–d). The
covalent functionalization of MCM-41 by the allylCalix reduces the
particle size by one-half of the unfunctionalized one but with enhanced
aggregation (Figure 3e–h). The changes occurred in the shape and size of the MSNs
are expected because of the covalent modification, and our results
agree well with the literature.38−40 The size reduction could be due
to either the flexible nature of the pores of MSNs or the dissolution
of these during the preparation of the hybrid. It is mentioned in
the literature that the MSNs with size >100 nm will have limitation
while crossing the biological barriers, such as, cell membrane. In
the present study, the covalent modification of MCM-41 by allylCalix
leads to the reduction in particle size along with alteration in the
aggregation state and surface morphology, which can improve the activity
of the hybrid as compared to that of simple MCM-41. This is an added
advantage of the covalent modification of MCM-41, while the presence
of calixarene moiety brings an additional hydrophobic core, which
is useful in the uptake of the drug. Even after covalent modification,
the porous surface morphology is clearly visible in TEM of the MCM-allylCalix
hybrid compound.

Loading and Characterization
of Dox onto the Silica–Calix
Hybrid
To demonstrate the applicability of the MCM-allylCalix
as a vehicle for drug storage and release, the silica–calix
hybrid was loaded with Dox by mixing the hybrid with the drug and
incubating it for 24 h. The amount of the loaded Dox was evaluated
by measuring the absorbance of the leached out Dox into alcohol and
comparing this with the standard curve. The Dox loading onto the silica–calix
hybrid was 30.5 μg/mg. As a control, Dox was loaded onto MCM-41
and resulting MCM-Dox has a loading of 10.5 μg/mg. Thus, the
drug loading of MCM-41 was increased by at least 300% upon converting
it into the silica–calix hybrid by covalent linking of allylCalix.
This suggests that the presence of organic functionality helps in
loading a higher concentration of Dox on the carrier owing to the
introduction of a more hydrophobic calixarene core.

MCM-allylCalix-Dox
was characterized by TEM, FT-IR, TGA, N2 sorption, diffuse
refectance spectroscopy (DRS)–UV, and fluorescence microscopy
to confirm the presence of Dox. Whereas MCM-allylCalix is colorless,
the hybrid exhibits a red color when loaded with Dox (Figure 4a). As Dox is expected to emit
red light, the same was observed under fluorescence microscopy, confirming
the successful loading of Dox in the MCM-allylCalix hybrid (Figure 4b–e). The
TEM of MCM-allylCalix-Dox (Figure 4f,g) showed spherical particles with a porous surface
morphology where Dox is well-dispersed on the entire surface. A comparison
of the micrographs given in Figure 3e–g with those given in Figure 4f,g reveals that the incorporation of Dox
into the hybrid does not appreciably change the morphology of the
particles.

but for Dox-loaded MCM-allylCalix-Dox. (f, g) TEM images of MCM-allylCalix-Dox

The FT-IR spectra of the Dox-loaded hybrid showed asymmetric,
symmetric,
and bending vibrations of −CH2– (2936, 2872,
and 1462 cm–1) with increased intensity, suggesting
an increased organic functionality on the hybrid. In addition to this,
the carbonyl group stretching vibration (1736 cm–1) for the Dox-loaded hybrid supports the presence of Dox by FT-IR
(Figure 5a). The Dox-loaded
hybrid is expected to show a greater weight loss in TGA. The presence
of Dox is supported by the increase in the weight loss from 25.4 to
38.1% in the temperature range 300–700 °C on going from
MCM-allylCalix to its Dox-loaded hybrid (Figure 5b). MCM-allylCalix-Dox shows no significant
change in N2 adsorption (Figure 5c). However, there is a significant shift
in capillary condensation, which was within the relative pressure
(P/Po) range of 0.6–1
in case of MCM-allylCalix, and this has been changed to 0.84–1
(P/Po) in the Dox-loaded
hybrid. The DRS–UV spectrum of MCM-allylCalix-Dox shows the
characteristic band with maximum at 490 nm, confirming the presence
of Dox in the loaded hybrid (Figure 5d). The presence of Dox was also shown by fluorescence
microscopy (Figure 4e).

In Vitro Release of the
Drug from MCM-allylCalix-Dox
The in vitro release of the
drug from MCM-allylCalix-Dox in PBS buffer
at pH 7.4 and 5 was investigated to study the release profile of Dox
from the hybrid with respect to time. The cumulative release of Dox
mainly occurred in the first 7 h under both the pH conditions, which
reached 26.4 and 36.3%, respectively, at pH 7.4 and 5 (Figure 5e). This initial burst of Dox
release could be attributed to the release of weakly bound Dox on
the surface of the hybrid. Thereafter, very slow and sustained release
of Dox was observed from 7 to 144 h, reaching 35.9 and 50.5% release,
respectively, at pH 7.4 and 5. The release of Dox is at least 40%
greater at pH 5 as compared to that at pH 7.4, both at 7 h and even
at 144 h. Thus, under acidic conditions, Dox is released in a greater
concentration. The data shown in Figure 5e supports that the rate of release of Dox
is greater at low pH due to the possible protonation followed by increased
solubility of Dox. Thus, Dox release sustains for more than 6 days.
The gradual release behavior and the prolonged release times are favorable
for the tumor therapy because sustainable and continued release of
drug from the carrier can effectively kill cancer cells and inhibit
tumor growth in the treatment.41

It is understood from Figure 5f that the amount of Dox released from the MCM-allylCalix
hybrid is higher (29.1 μg Dox) as compared to that from simple
MCM, i.e., MCM-Dox (12.3 μg Dox), up to 7 h of the release time
at pH 5. Following this, very slow and sustained release of Dox was
observed from the hybrid for more than 72 h, whereas in case of inorganic
MCM-Dox alone, the release of Dox (13.2 μg) saturates after
24 h, amounting to a burst of release in the latter case. Thus, all
of the data supports that the silica–calix hybrid gives sustained
release of drug over a period of several days as compared to that
from the unmodified MCM-41 at pH 5 in PBS.

Cytotoxicity of the Dox-Free
and Dox-Loaded Silica–Calix
Hybrid for Cancer Cells
To understand the biocompatibility
of the MCM-allylCalix (Dox-free) hybrid, the cell viability assay
was performed by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) method on three different cancer cell lines, viz., MCF7,
MDA-MB231, and HeLa, and the corresponding data is given in Figure 6. The Dox-free hybrid
shows greater cell viability for MDA-MB231 cells, whereas least cell
viability for MCF7 cells at both 24 and 48 h of incubation. The Dox-free
control showed 150% more cell viability in the case of MDA-MB231 and
HeLa cells as compared to that for MCF7 cells. The Dox-loaded hybrid
showed less cell viability as compared to that of the Dox-free hybrid
for all of the cell lines. The Dox-loaded hybrid showed no significant
change in the MCF7 cell viability at 24 h; however, the cell viability
dramatically decreased by about 300% at 48 h of treatment. For MDA-MB231
cells, the Dox-loaded hybrid showed a decrease in the viability by
140% for 24 h treatment, which further decreased to ∼200% at
48 h. The Dox-loaded hybrid showed the decrease in the cell viability
for HeLa cells by ∼220% as compared to that of the Dox-free
hybrid for both 24 and 48 h incubation. This way the Dox-loaded system
could kill MCF7 cells to a maximum extent as compared with the other
two types of cells. This is due to the fact that the three cell lines
used for the present study are from different tissue origins and hence
possess different receptors on their cell membrane. This can result
in difference in their cellular uptake of the drug.

and MCM-allylCalix-Dox on (a)
MCF7, (b) MDA-MB231, and (c) HeLa cells at 24 and 48 h incubation.
Only cells (untreated) are used as control. Color codes: MCM-allylCalix_24

of MCM-allylCalix-Dox for the same three cell lines. The results are
presented as average percentages of the cell viability over three
replicas.

The IC50 data given
in Figure 6d clearly
support cell-dependent anticancer
activity of the drug, viz., the Dox-loaded hybrid. The IC50 of the Dox-loaded hybrid for Hela cells is 6-fold greater, whereas
it is 2-fold greater for MDA-MB231, as compared to that for MCF7 cells.
Thus, the results show that the Dox-loaded hybrid is highly effective
in killing MCF7 cells up to 80% in 48 h.

Internalization of Dox
into MCF7 and HeLa Cells by FACS
On the basis of the cytotoxicity
differences observed between MCF7
and HeLa cells, we thought to study the internalization of Dox. The
FACS data showed no fluorescence shift in the case of just the cells
alone and the cells treated with the Dox-free hybrid for both the
cell lines. However, a clear fluorescence shift is observed when cells
were treated with the Dox-loaded hybrid (Supporting Information, Figures S4 and S5). The relative fluorescence
intensity obtained from FACS increases with an increase in the concentration
of the Dox-loaded hybrid as a result of greater internalization of
Dox for both the cell lines (Figure 7a,b). The higher cytotoxicity of the Dox-loaded hybrid
for MCF7 cells as compared to that for HeLa cells was further supported
by the comparison of median intensities of the two cell lines obtained
from FACS (Figure 7c). The MCF7 cells showed ∼150% more internalization of Dox
as compared to that for HeLa cells for both the concentrations, which
eventually resulted in greater killing of the MCF7 cells as compared
to that of the other cell lines. The internalization of the silica–calix
hybrid was shown by a X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) study
(Figure 7d). The HeLa
cells were incubated with the Dox-free hybrid (200 μg/mL) for
24 h and washed subsequently with water several times. The resulting
cells showed the presence of Si 2p in the XPS spectrum, supporting
the internalization of the silica–calix hybrid in the HeLa
cells. The result is confirmed because the control cells do not show
Si 2p in the XPS spectrum.

cells (black) and HeLa cells treated with the silica–calix

Localization of Dox in
MCF7 and HeLa Cells by Fluorescence Microscopy
Fluorescence
microscopy studies showed increasing red fluorescence
with an increase in the concentration of the added Dox-loaded hybrid
(Figure 8) for both
the cell lines. The data further supported the localization of Dox
in cytoplasm when the incubation was for 24 h in the case of both
the cells, and further incubation led to its entry into the nucleus
and decreased the cell number due to cell death (Supporting Information, Figure S6). The comparison of Dox internalization
by measuring the fluorescence intensities showed ∼250% more
internalization of the Dox-loaded hybrid into both the cells on treating
with 100 μg/mL as compared to that with 50 μg/mL, whereas
∼120% more internalization of Dox in MCF7 as compared to that
in HeLa cells (Supporting Information, Figure S7). These studies suggest that the silica–calix hybrid
acts as a drug carrier to cells and hence the corresponding nanoparticles
are useful in cancer chemotherapy.

Conclusions and Correlations
In the present article, we have successfully functionalized the
surface of mesoporous silica nanoparticles covalently by allylCalix
through its lower rim, which leads to the inorganic–organic
hybrid, MCM-allylCalix. The presence of the organic functionalization
was confirmed by various spectroscopy techniques and was quantified
by thermal analysis, which suggested the presence of ∼18% of
the organic calixarene moiety in the hybrid compound. Furthermore,
the changes observed in the FT-IR spectra and N2 sorption
isotherm supported the formation of the MCM-allylCalix hybrid. 13C MAS–NMR spectra of the hybrid showed the presence
of all of the typical carbons of the allylCalix derivative. 29Si MAS–NMR spectra of the hybrid showed the presence of the
T2 and T3 silicon species, suggesting the presence
of covalently attached organic functionality onto the MCM-allylCalix
hybrid. All of the experimental data is consistent with the presence
of the covalently integrated calixarene moiety onto the inorganic
silica matrix. Furthermore, the TEM studies revealed that after the
covalent modification there is a significant reduction in the size
of the silica nanoparticles with a high degree of aggregation. Indeed,
such aggregation is an expected phenomenon of the conjugates of calixarenes.15,16

The MCM-allylCalix hybrid has shown a great potential for
acting
as a carrier of anticancer drug Dox. The studies revealed that the
Dox loading by the hybrid was increased up to 300% as compared to
that by unfunctionalized MCM-41. This is due to the presence of the
calixarene cavity as well as the allyl moiety providing a suitable
hydrophobic environment for the drug to be loaded. The Dox-loaded
hybrid, MCM-allylCalix-Dox, was characterized by TEM, FT-IR, TGA,
DRS–UV, and N2 sorption studies, which supported
the successful loading of Dox on the hybrid, and was confirmed by
its red fluorescence emission, which is the characteristic of Dox.
The in vitro release into PBS buffer showed a higher release rate
of Dox in an acidic medium at pH 5 as compared to that in the neutral
medium at pH 7.4. Overall, the Dox release was observed to be 35.9
and 50.5%, respectively, at pH 7.4 and 5 in 144 h. On comparing the
release profiles, it was observed that MCM-allylCalix-Dox (29.1 μg
Dox) releases 240% greater amount of the drug as compared to that
from the control, MCM-Dox (12.3 μg Dox). The hybrid system exhibited
slow and sustained release of Dox for few days, whereas saturation
occurs within 1 day in the case of simple MCM-41. The presence of
the aromatic hydrophobic core as well as the steric effects of the
bulkier organic calixarenes plays a vital role in the slow and sustained
release of Dox from the MCM-allylCalix hybrid. All of these features
can be well-correlated from Scheme 2.

Scheme 2 Schematic Representation of the Highlights of the
Synthesis, Characterization,
Drug Delivery, and Anticancer Activity of MCM-allylCalix
The cytotoxicity studies showed
that among the three different
types of cancer cells, the Dox-loaded hybrid is more toxic to MCF7
cells as than to the HeLa and MDA-MB231 cells. The results were further
supported by cell internalization of MCM-allylCalix-Dox by FACS and
fluorescence microscopy. Both FACS and microscopy data suggested concentration-dependent
internalization of the Dox-loaded hybrid into the MCF7 and HeLa cells.
Both the studies showed 150% greater internalization of the Dox-Loaded
hybrid in MCF7 cells as compared to that in HeLa cells. The fluorescence
microscopy studies showed the localization of Dox in the cytoplasm
in 24 h and in nucleus with an increasing incubation time. The entry
of the MCM-allylCalix hybrid (Dox-free) into the HeLa cells was further
confirmed by XPS analysis. All of these studies support that the silica–calix
hybrid acts as a drug vehicle and provides controlled release of drug
into the cancer cells and is of great use in cancer chemotherapy.

Experimental
Section
All of the chemicals used were of A.R. grade. Tetraethylorthosilicate
and (3-glycidyloxypropyl)trimethoxysilane (GPTMS) were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich. All other solvents and reagents used were purchased
from Merck. Milli-Q water is used in the present study. The upper-rim
allylCalix was synthesized in three steps starting from p-tert-butyl calix[4]arene, as given in Scheme 1, and the synthesis
and characterization of these are given here.

Synthesis and Characterization
of 1a
Upper
rim dealkylation of tert-butyl calix[4]arene was
carried out as reported earlier42 in 85%
yield. The product, 1a, was recrystallized by trituration
from the CHCl3–CH3OH mixture. 1H NMR: (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 10.19 (s, 4H, ArOH),
7.05 (d, 8H, Ar-H), 6.72 (t, 4H, Ar-H), 4.25 (d, 4H, Ar-CH2-Ar), 3.54 (d, 4H, Ar-CH2-Ar). 13C NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz, δ ppm): 31.72 (Ar-CH2-Ar), 122.27,
128.26, 129.00, 148.79 (Ar-C). ESI-MS: m/z = 463.13 [M + K]. All of the spectra are given in Figure S1.

Synthesis and Chracterization
of Lower-Rim Allyl Calix[4]arene, 1b
The lower-rim
allyl calixarene conjugate was synthesized
by the reported method.43 The dealkylated
calixarene, 1a, (1.07 g, 2.5 mmol) was taken (in 50 mL
of THF + 5 mL of dimethylformamide), NaH (1.0 g, 41 mmol) and allyl
bromide (14 g, 115 mmol) were then added to this, and the reaction
mixture was refluxed for 24 h. The solvent was then removed by rotavac,
and the residue was partitioned between water and CHCl3. The CHCl3 extract was washed with water and dried. The
residue was recrystallized from ethanol to result in pure 1b. Yield: 71%, ESI-MS: m/z = 623.27
[M + K]. Elemental analysis, calculated: C = 82.16%, H = 6.89%, O
= 10.94% and experimental: C = 78.97%, H = 6.03%, O = 14.99%. All
of the spectra are given in Figure S2.

Synthesis and Chracterization of allylCalix
A solution
of 1b (3.15 g, 5.4 mmol) in 25 mL of N,N-dimethylaniline was refluxed at 210 °C for
6 h under a N2 atmosphere. Upon acidification of the reaction
mixture with concentrated HCl, a precipitate was obtained, and the
filtered crude compound (allylCalix) was recrystallized from ethanol.
Yield: 91%, 1H NMR: (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ:
10.15 (s, 4H), 6.84 (s, 8H), 5.89 (ddt, J = 17, 10.5,
6.8 Hz, 4H), 5.04 (br. d, J = 17.0 Hz, 4H), 5.03
(br. d, J = 17.0 Hz, 4H), 4.19 (br. d, J = 9.0 Hz, 4H), 3.45 (br. d, J = 9.0 Hz, 4H), 3.18
(d, J = 6.8 Hz, 8H). 13C NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz, δ ppm): 31.81 (Ar-CH2-Ar), 39.34
(Ar-CH2), 115.59, 128.20 (−CH=CH2) 128.98, 133.47, 137.61, 147.07 (Ar-C). ESI-MS: 623.25 [M + K].
Elemental analysis, calculated: C = 82.16%, H = 6.89%, O = 10.94%
and experimental: C = 79.36%, H = 6.75%, O = 13.87%. All of the spectra
are given in Figure S3.

Synthesis of
Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles, MCM-41
MCM-41 was prepared
as per the reported procedure.37 The product
was dried in an oven and calcined in air at
550 °C for 5 h. These particles were characterized by TEM, BET,
and FT-IR.

Covalent Modification of MCM-41 with the
Allyl Calixarene Conjugate
(MCM-allylCalix)
The synthesis of the silica–calix
hybrid, MCM-allylCalix, was carried out by taking 90 mg (0.15 mmol)
of allylCalix with GPTMS (72 μL, 0.33 mmol) in the presence
of three drops of perchloric acid in 15 mL of dry toluene. The reaction
mixture was heated at 80 °C for 15 h under a N2 atmosphere.
This was followed by addition of MCM-41 (450 mg), and the reaction
mixture was further refluxed at 110 °C for 48 h. MCM-allylCalix
was isolated by centrifugation, and the product was washed with each
of the following solvents: toluene, dichloromethane, water, methanol,
and acetone, and the product was then dried under vacuum for 2 h (yield,
378 mg). This was characterized by different spectral and microscopy
techniques. Energy-dispersive spectrometry elemental analysis: C =
25.9%, O = 53.1%, Si = 21%.

Drug Loading and Release
The loading
of doxorubicin
hydrochloride (Dox) onto the MCM-allylCalix hybrid was carried out
by taking 500 μL of Dox solution (2 mg/mL) along with 50 mg
of MCM-allylCalix and 500 μL of water, and the reaction mixture
was shaken for 24 h at room temperature. Then, the Dox-loaded hybrid,
viz., MCM-allylCalix-Dox, was isolated by centrifugation, washed with
water, and then dried under vacuum. MCM-allylCalix-Dox was taken with
ethanol (1 mg/mL), sonicated for 2 h, and analyzed for the leached
Dox by UV–vis spectroscopy. The absorption at 490 nm was compared
with the standard curve to estimate the concentration of loaded Dox.

The release of Dox was carried out by taking 3 mg of the Dox-loaded
hybrid in 1.5 mL of 165.7 mM PBS buffer (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl,
8 mM Na2HPO4, and 2 mM KH2PO4) followed by incubation with stirring up to 144 h at pH 7.4
and 5. In certain time intervals, 1 mL of the supernatant solution
was analyzed for absorption at 490 nm and replaced by 1 mL of fresh
buffer solution. The amount of Dox released was measured by comparing
the absorbance values with the standard curve.

Instrumental Techniques
The organic compounds were
characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectra recorded
on Avance III-400 Bruker and ESI-MS on a Q-TOF instrument using positive
ion mode. TGA analysis of the samples was carried out using Mettler
Toledo Star SW 7.01 under a nitrogen atmosphere. The FT-IR spectra
of quantitative samples were measured in KBr at 4000–400 cm–1 using a Perkin-Elmer spectrometer. The specific surface
area measurements were performed on a Quantachrome Autosorb Automated
Gas Sorption Instrument (Autosorb 1) with N2 adsorption
at 77 K. The TEM micrographs were measured on PHILIPS TEM model-CM
200 working at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV.

Cell Viability
Assay
All of the three cancer cell lines,
viz., HeLa, MCF7, and MDA-MB231, were obtained from NCCS Pune, India,
and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (GIBCO)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (GIBCO) and 1% antibiotics
(penicillin and streptomycin, GIBCO). To understand the effect of
MCM-allylCalix-Dox on the viability of these three cancer cells, the
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)
assay were performed. The cells were cultured in 96-well plates with
15 000 cells per well and were incubated for 24 h to get confluence
of cells. The cells were then treated with different concentrations
of MCM-allylCalix (as control) and MCM-allylCalix-Dox (10, 20, 30,
50, 80, and 100 μg/mL) separately and were incubated for 24
and 48 h at 37 °C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. After
this treatment, 10 μL of the MTT reagent (5 mg/mL) was added
to each well by replacing the old media and incubating further for
4 h in the dark. The medium was then removed, and 200 μL of
dimethyl sulfoxide was added to dissolve the formazan crystals. The
absorbance at 570 nm was measured using a plate reader. The cells
without any nanoparticle treatment were used as a control.

Flow Cytometry
HeLa cells were cultured in 6-well plates
with seed density of 0.5 × 106 cells and kept for
24 h incubation. At the confluence state, the cells were treated with
MCM-allylCalix-Dox with different concentrations (30, 50, 80, and
100 μg/mL) for 24 h. For this, simple (untreated) cells and
MCM-allylCalix-treated cells were used as controls. The cells were
harvested from the plate by centrifugation at 1000 rpm per 3 min and
washed with PBS buffer twice. Then, 500 μL of PBS was added
to all of the samples, and the samples were analyzed by BD FACSARIA
(BD Bioscience) using a red filter. These results were further analyzed
using “flowing software”. Similar studies were carried
out even with MCF7 cell lines but by using 50 and 100 μg/mL
concentrations of the Dox-loaded hybrid (MCM-allylCalix-Dox).

Fluorescence
Microscopy
The cells were incubated in
6-well plates with cover slips, and 0.5 × 106 cells
were seeded and kept to get confluence. These were treated with MCM-allylCalix-Dox
of two different concentrations (50 and 100 μg/mL). Then, the
media was removed, the cells were washed with PBS three times, a cover
slip was placed on a glass slide with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI), and observed under a fluorescence microscope using red and
blue filters.
