We
tested the targeting efficiency of magnetoliposomes (MLPs) labeled
with tripeptide arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) on two types
of cells: HeLa cells expressing RGD receptors and 3T3 cells lacking
RGD receptors. The targeting ability of RGD-MLPs was compared to that
of bare MLPs and MLPs stabilized with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG).
Cellular internalization of these liposomes was determined by flow
cytometry and confocal microscopy, which showed that both types of
cells took up more nontargeting MLPs than targeting RGD-MLPs or PEG-MLPs,
with PEG-MLPs showing the lowest degree of internalization. The presence
of specific receptors on HeLa cells did not facilitate the binding
of RGD-MLPs, probably due to the presence of PEG chains on the liposomal
surface. The polymer increases the circulation time of the liposomes
in the organism but reduces their interactions with cells. Despite
the localization of the RGD peptide on the tip of PEG in RGD-MLPs,
the interaction between the liposome and cell was still limited. To
avoid this drawback, targeting drug delivery systems can be prepared
with two types of PEG: one of a short length to enable biocompatibility
and the other of a longer chain to carry the ligand.

Introduction
The
conventional administration of drugs presents some limitations
and problems. For many treatments, large drug doses are required to
achieve high local concentrations, with the potential risk of adverse
side effects. Moreover, the lack of targeted delivery to the site
of interest and the rapid clearance by the mononuclear phagocyte system
(MPS) pose other critical challenges for the administration of any
drug.1 Recent advances in materials science
and biotechnology have enabled the development of new methods of drug
delivery that can potentially overcome the abovementioned limitations.
One of these methods involves the use of particulate systems for drug
delivery, such as microspheres, nanoparticles, lipoproteins, soluble
polymers, micelles, and liposomes.2 Targeting
nanoparticles can increase the efficiency of drugs by delivering them
directly to the sites of interest. This requires site-directed ligands
on the surfaces of the systems to further enhance their selective
targeting or the engineering of stimuli-sensitive systems that change
their physical properties in response to an external stimulus (e.g.,
temperature, pH, ionic strength, or a magnetic gradient for magnetic
targeting).3

Magnetic nanoparticles
(MNPs) are promising stimuli-sensitive drug
carriers because of their responsiveness to a magnetic field. An applied
extracorporeal magnetic field can concentrate these nanosystems at
the desired site, keeping them in a particular place for a given period
of time until the encapsulated drug is released, thereby minimizing
any side effects due to nonspecific distributions.4−6

Ligands
(e.g., antibodies, peptides, or carbohydrates) recognizing
tumor-associated antigens expressed on tumor cell surfaces have been
used for cancer therapy. Some of the structures suitable for tumor
targeting belong to integrins, a family of heterodimeric cell surface
receptors, consisting of α- and β-subunits, which mediate
cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix and other cells.7 These cell surface receptors are universally
expressed by tumor and normal cells. However, the αV (especially αVβ3) forms are highly
expressed on endothelial cells lining tumor cells but poorly expressed
on resting endothelial cells and most normal organs, making them a
potential target for antiangiogenesis treatment. Targeting the αVβ3 integrin may provide an opportunity to
targeting the tumor endothelium and destroy tumor vessels without
harming the microvessels of normal tissue.8 Indeed, targeting tumor vasculature rather than the tumor cells
themselves has been described as a promising new approach for cancer
therapy.9 The ligands that have been used
for targeting these integrins carry the arginine-glycine-aspartic
acid (RGD) motif. The RGD sequence forms the basis of a variety of
RGD-containing peptides that display preferential binding to either
the αVβ3 integrin and related αV integrins or other types of integrins. Because the RGD sequence
is conserved in all natural and newly developed ligands, the relative
affinity and specificity of the peptides and proteins are determined
by other amino acid residues flanking the RGD motif, especially the
two amino acids following the aspartic acid.10 In addition to the direct interactions between these residues and
integrin, flanking groups influence the folding of the peptide and
thus its conformation. Cyclization is commonly used to improve the
binding properties of RGD peptides.11 Linear
RGD peptides are highly susceptible to chemical degradation due to
the reaction of the aspartic residue with the peptide backbone.12 Because the rigidity conferred by cyclization
prevents this problem, cyclic peptides are more stable and suitable
for biological targeting. Thus, RGD-containing peptides have been
used in tumor imaging, treatments against angiogenesis, and tumor
targeting with radionuclides or chemotherapeutic drugs.13

Liposomes have been extensively investigated
as potential drug
carriers in cancer chemotherapy.14 A major
drawback of using liposomes is their rapid degradation by the mononuclear
phagocyte system (MPS). As with all foreign colloidal particles, liposomes
are quickly recognized as “nonself” and taken up by
the cells of the MPS, chiefly macrophages in the liver and spleen.
To prolong their circulation time in vivo, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)
is grafted onto the lipid surface.15 Such
liposomes, classified as sterically stable liposomes, present a hydrophilic
corona around the particles that minimizes nonspecific adsorption
of proteins onto the liposome surface, thus rendering the liposomes
“invisible” to macrophages (“stealth”
effect). Liposomes smaller than 200 nm can exploit a feature of the
tumor microenvironment, the so-called enhanced permeability and retention
(EPR) effect.16 Because of the leaky vasculature
of the tumor, the intratumoral accumulation of liposomes is high relative
to normal tissue.17,18

In this study, magnetoliposomes
(MLPs) and sterically stabilized
liposomes containing magnetic nanoparticles (PEG-MLPs) were prepared.
Such liposomes can be targeted to the site of interest by applying
an external magnetic field. To generate RGD-MLPs, the RGD peptide
was grafted onto the distal end of the PEG chain attached to the liposomes
to target integrin αVβ3 expressed
on many cancer cells. Hence, this kind of liposome (RGD-MLPs) combines
magnetic and receptor-specific targeting. The targeting efficiency
of RGD-MLPs in vitro was tested on two types of cells: 3T3 murine
Swiss albino embryo fibroblasts and HeLa cells derived from human
epithelial cervical cancer. We selected these cell lines from different
species and with different embryonic origins as model systems to understand
the cell-specific responses induced by our nanoparticles.19

Cellular uptake of RGD-MLPs, MLPs, and
PEG-MLPs was studied in
3T3 and HeLa cells after establishing the safe working concentrations
of these liposomes for cell labeling. To visualize the cellular uptake
of the liposomes by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry, liposomes
were prepared by incorporating 0.3 mol % rhodamine B (Rho) into the
lipid bilayer.

Results
Characterization of MNPs
and RGD-MLPs
MNPs were synthesized
by coprecipitating iron salts in the presence of PEG. The resulting
ferrofluid was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM),
high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), high-angle annular dark-field imaging
(HAADF), (Figure 1)
photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS), and Doppler microelectrophoresis.

HRTEM image and fast Fourier transform (FFT) from the highlighted
region; and (C) HAADF image of the sample. The right panel is the
crystal model of magnetite seen along the [110] zone axis, which matches
with the highlighted region of the image.

From the TEM images, we can observe that the ferrofluid consisted
of small clusters of primary particles with diameters between 5 and
15 nm (Figure 1A). Figure 1B displays a HRTEM
image of the iron oxide nanoparticle sample. The appearance was that
of ultrafine agglomerate crystallites. The two distinct levels of
contrast indicate that nanoparticles contained several components.
The FFT of the labeled squared region showed the diffraction pattern
of magnetite in the [112] zone axis. The HAADF image (Figure 1C) showed the nanoparticles
at atomic resolution. The right panel is the crystal model seen along
the [110] zone axis, which matched with the highlighted region of
the image. PEG-coated magnetic nanoparticles had an intensity-weighted
average hydrodynamic diameter of 62 ± 13 nm with a polydispersity
index (PI) of 0.10 ± 0.06 from PCS measurements. The hydroxyl
groups of the PEG were responsible for the low surface charge of the
nanoparticles at pH 6.5 (ζ-potential ∼5 mV). The particles
responded to an external magnetic field (Figure 2A), exhibited superparamagnetic behavior,
and had a magnetization of 55 emu g–1 at 5 kOe at
room temperature (Figure 2B). The colloidal stability of the ferrofluid under perikinetic
conditions was extremely high; the size and size distribution remained
unaltered for more than 5 years. This ferrofluid was encapsulated
in bare and PEGylated liposomes. One part of the PEGylated liposomes
was functionalized with the RGD peptide at a ratio of 1:10 RGD/PEG.
For flow cytometry and confocal microscopy, fluorescence probe Rho
was inserted into MLPs at a ratio of 100:3 lipid/Rho.

Figure 3 shows
the
main characteristics of these MLPs. Figure 3A is a schematic representation of the functionalized
MLPs. The average hydrodynamic diameter was 220 ± 4 nm for MNPs,
146 ± 4 nm for PEG-MNPs, and 161 ± 0.5 nm for RGD-MNPs (Figure 3B). The size distribution
of all of the MLPs was monomodal (PI ∼ 0.20). Electrophoretic
mobility measurements of MLPs, PEG-MLPs, and RGD-MLPs indicated ζ-potentials
of −4.2 ± 0.1, −10.3 ± 0.3, and −13.5
± 0.1 mV, respectively (mean ± standard deviation) (Figure 3C). The iron content,
determined spectroscopically, was 10 mM. This amount, in relation
to the phospholipid concentration of 25 mM, corresponded to 23.52
mg of iron by millimole of phospholipid.

The lipids present in the liposome
membrane have the following
molecular surface areas: 0.62 nm2 for dimyristoyl phosphatidyl
choline (DMPC),20 0.48 nm2 for
distearoyl phosphatidyl ethanolamine (DSPE),21 and 0.35 nm2 for cholesterol (CHOL).22 From the molar ratio of RGD-MLPs and taking into consideration
a symmetrical distribution of lipids in the bilayer and ideal mixing,
where the area per molecule is simply a weighted average of the pure
component areas, an average lipid molecular surface area of 0.514
nm2 was calculated. Assuming a liposome diameter of 100
nm and that all of the RGD motifs present were coupled to a maleimide
group (this reaction has been reported to be one of the most efficient
reactions in bioconjugate chemistry),23 the number of RGD molecules present in the outer monolayer of the
liposomes was ∼180. The average number of iron oxide cores
in the liposomes was calculated to be 1.35, which is consistent with
the inner volume of a liposome as well as the hydrodynamic radius
of a magnetic particle. For this calculation, the iron oxide cores
were assumed to be monodispersed (12 nm in diameter), perfectly spherical,
and with a density of 5100 kg m–3.

Cell Viability
Before studying the cellular internalization
of MLPs, safe working concentrations of the three types of MLPs were
first established. The effects of targeting RGD-MLPs on HeLa and 3T3
cells were evaluated and compared to those of nontargeting MLPs and
PEG-MLPs. First, the cytotoxic effects exerted by the ferrofluid and
bare liposomes were determined. It is known that iron oxide nanoparticles
can be internalized into cellular compartments, such as the lysosome,
and that permeabilization of the lysosome membrane promotes cell death.24 We observed that after 24 h of incubation the
ferrofluid did not affect the cell cycle in the range of 0.05–12
mM Fe, as determined by the neutral red (NR) uptake assay.

The
half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of the ferrofluid
in both cell types was >12 mM (Table S1 and Figure S1). The range of safe concentrations was lower in the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay. In the 0.05–0.20 mM range, the iron oxide
cores themselves did not exert toxic effects on the cells. IC50 values of 5.6 and 8.4 mM were obtained in 3T3 and HeLa cells,
respectively. To determine any potential toxic effects of the liposomes,
cell viability was assessed in the presence of bare liposomes, that
is, liposomes formed solely of DMPC and CHOL at the same molar ratio
as that used to prepare the three types of MLPs studied here. This
lipid composition was completely innocuous (IC50 > 20
mM)
(Table S1 and Figure S2). To study the
toxicity of the three types of MLPs, cells were exposed to a concentration
range of nanoparticles (0.08–20 mM) for 24 h. These nanoparticles
induced some toxicity at relatively high concentrations, especially
those containing PEG (Table S1 and Figures S3–S5). On the basis of these results, subsequent experiments were performed
using a phospholipid concentration of 0.60 mM (with an iron content
of 0.2 mM).

Flow Cytometry
Flow cytometry was
used to determine
the relative amount of intracellular uptake of the different MLPs.
Forward and sideward scatter diagrams of single-cell suspensions demonstrated
that at least the majority of cells were still intact, with only small
amounts of debris occurring (Figures S6 and S7). To distinguish between fluorescence caused by MLP binding and
autofluorescence from unlabeled cells, the autofluorescence of cells
was measured and a cutoff point was determined. After incubation of
3T3 and HeLa cells with MLPs, PEG-MLPs, or RGD-MLPs for 4 h, flow
cytometry revealed significantly higher mean fluorescence intensities
for cells incubated with MLPs (regardless of their composition) compared
to those for control cells (Figures 4 and 5). Both endpoints emphasize
different properties of the cell. Whereas MTT measures the mitochondrial
activity, NR gives information about the membrane integrity. In addition,
NR has to be accumulated in lysosomes for staining and changes in
lysosomal function/pH can cause decreased dye uptake. Therefore, uptake
of particles, for instance, could cause the changes in lysosome pH.
However, only in the case of ferrofluid (see Figure S1), a strong influence of the endpoint method on the selectivity
on the mode of action was observed. Changes in cell viability determined
by these two endpoints suggested that the interaction of ferrofluid
with cells involves a poor interaction with the plasmatic membrane.
The bare and PEGylated MLPs (Figure S3)
did not demonstrate so strong differences between these systems. In
both cases, the decrease in cell viability using MTT suggested the
uptake and internalization mediated by the nanoparticulated system.

the fluorescence of untreated cells is shown.

MLPs, PEG-MLPs, or RGD-MLPs and their nonmagnetic counterparts. In
the center, the fluorescence of untreated cells is shown.

In 3T3 cells, MLP uptake increased the mean fluorescence
intensity
by a factor of 6–7, whereas RGD-MLPs and PEG-MLPs produced
a fluorescence signal 6 and 4 times stronger, respectively. The differences
in fluorescence intensities between MLPs and the other two liposomes
were greater in HeLa than in 3T3 cells. In this way, MLPs increased
the mean fluorescence intensity by a factor of 8–9 in HeLa
cells, with the fluorescence intensity being only 5 times stronger
with RGD-MLPs and 4 times stronger with PEG-MLPs. To ascertain whether
the magnetic properties of the liposomes affected cellular uptake,
the uptake of bare liposomes with no ferrofluid was also studied.
In 3T3 and especially HeLa cells, MLPs were internalized to a higher
extent than in bare liposomes. Table 1 summarizes the results.

Confocal Microscopy
To visualize
the distribution of
the fluorescence signals in cells, laser scanning confocal microscopy
was performed with 3T3 and HeLa cells (Figures 6–9) after 2,
4, and 24 h of incubation with any of the types of MLP bearing Rho
(red channel). The cell membrane was stained with cell-membrane-impermeable
dye Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) (green
channel), whereas the nucleus was stained with membrane-permeable
dye Hoechst 33342 (blue channel). Figure 6 shows the negative control of both 3T3 and
HeLa cells.

for 4 h. Green fluorescent signals indicate the cellular membranes,
and the blue ones, the nucleus.

Figures 7 and 8 show representative confocal images of the cells
incubated for 2, 4, or 24 h with bare MLPs (Figure 7) or RGD-MLPs (Figure 8). Figure 9 shows the representative confocal
images of the cells incubated with PEG-MLPs. Images obtained from
the red and green channels were merged. After internalization, nanoparticles
are initially confined inside endosomes, which are submicrometric
vesicles of the endocytic pathway. Internalization of nanoparticles
into endosomes is indicated by the red liposome fluorescence between
the green cell membrane and the blue nucleus in the confocal images,
which is absent in the images of corresponding control cells. Figure 7A shows that MLP
internalization in 3T3 cells after 24 h of incubation is greater.
In HeLa cells (Figure 7B), MLP internalization could already be observed at 2 h but became
lower at 24 h. Thus, the kinetics of nanoparticle uptake depended
on the type of cell and it is particularly fast. RGD-MLP internalization
could be clearly seen in 3T3 cells at 2 and 4 h of incubation, but
only a few cells displayed uptake after 24 h (Figure 8A). By contrast, HeLa cells did not internalize
RGD-MLPs at any of the time points studied (Figure 8B). The internalization of PEG-MLPs was unappreciable
at any incubation time (Figure 9A,B). These results were consistent with those obtained with
flow cytometry.

Discussion
Adding
specific ligands to the surfaces of nanoparticles to target
receptors that are overexpressed in anomalous circumstances in cells
(e.g., the overexpression of αVβ3 integrin or CD44 in cancerous cells) is a good strategy for concentrating
nanoparticles at the sites of interest and, thus, facilitating their
internalization and accumulation inside the desired cells via the
EPR effect. Moreover, nanoparticles can carry a drug and release it
more efficiently inside the cells of interest. Nanoparticles can also
contain iron oxide cores conferring superparamagnetic properties of
a suitable size. Such nanoparticles can be used to induce death of
the cells in the vicinity by generating heat after exposure to radiofrequency
radiation (hyperthermia) or to visualize pathological conditions by
magnetic resonance imaging. In conclusion, it is possible to prepare
nanoparticulate systems that behave as multifunctional nanoplatforms.
Among the different types of nanoparticles that can be used as theranostic
platforms, targeted MLPs are a good example. Indeed, a wide range
of ligand-bearing MLPs (or liposomes) have been described to date.9,25−30

In the present work, functionalized MLPs bearing RGD moieties
were
used for the specific labeling of αVβ3-integrin-expressing HeLa cells and for the unspecific labeling of
3T3 fibroblasts (which also present integrins on their surface but
are collagen receptors and not RGD receptors).31 The cell interactions of the RGD-MLPs were compared to
those of RGD-lacking MLPs (with or without PEG).

We first prepared
iron oxide nanoparticles stabilized with PEG,
which is currently considered to be the best antibiofouling agent
and described as GRAS (generally regarded as safe) by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration. The ferrofluid was encapsulated in bare liposomes
and in liposomes with PEG attached covalently to the lipid surface.
Furthermore, a part of the PEGylated liposomes was functionalized
with cyclic peptide RGD to generate RGD-MLPs. The average diameter
of the obtained MLPs was lower than 220 nm (≈the pore size
of the membranes used). The reduction of size in all types of the
prepared liposomes was due to the presence of CHOL because it produces
a condensation effect resulting from particular changes in the phase
behavior elicited by CHOL.32 Moreover,
compared with MLPs, PEG-MLPs and RGD-MLPs presented a significantly
lower diameter due to the insertion of PEG. PEG affects compressibility
and the packing of the lipid bilayer, with PEG-DSPE concentrations
higher than 8 mol % decreasing the particle size due to the appearance
of PEG-DSPE-enriched micelles at the expense of liposomes.33 Regarding the number of iron oxide cores inside
the liposomes, the theoretical value of 1–2 cores per liposome
is consistent with the inner volume of an average liposome (with a
diameter of 150 nm) and the hydrodynamic radius of a nanoparticle
of ferrofluid because the high hydrophilicity of PEG involves a high
level of hydration of the polymer.

Historically, iron oxide
nanoparticles have been considered safe
given the high levels of iron ions that can be tolerated (up to 4
mM). However, some groups have more recently shown that exposure to
iron oxide nanoparticles can lead to a wide variety of toxic effects
impacting the cell morphology, cytoskeleton, proliferation, viability,
and cellular homeostasis.34−37 Our results showed that the MLPs used in this study
were not toxic to 3T3 and HeLa cells, when using the NR assay (IC50 > 12 mM). This value was lower for the MTT assays, which
measure levels of mitochondrial dehydrogenase enzymes (Figure S1, Supporting Information). Our data
indicated that bare liposomes and MLPs were innocuous up to a lipid
concentration of 10 mM after 24 h of incubation (Table S1 and Figures S2 and S3). By contrast, RGD-MLPs and
PEG-MLPs exhibited an appreciable toxicity that differed in its extent
between the 3T3 and HeLa cells (Figures S4 and S5). For instance, RGD-MLPs, at a lipid concentration of 0.6
mM, reduced cell viability to 73.2 ± 5.6% in 3T3 cells and 81.4
± 3.6% in HeLa cells (in the MTT assays). At the same concentration,
bare MLPs and bare liposomes gave cell viabilities of ca. 100% in
3T3 and HeLa cells for both the NR and MTT assays. As a control, there
were no cytotoxic effects when identical volumes of a nanoparticle-free
buffer were used to replace the medium, indicating that the reduction
in cell viability was not due to a limited nutrient supply.38 The toxic effects could be attributed to any
of the components present in the liposome (e.g., the maleimide group
or the cyclic peptide). Although a lack of toxicity of liposomes bearing
the maleimide group has been shown previously,39 the toxicity of both RGD-MLPs and PEG-MLPs could be due
to the cyclic peptide promoting the toxicity elicited by the maleimide
group.

Our flow cytometry results were initially quite surprising.
MLPs,
regardless of their composition, were internalized to a greater extent
than the nonmagnetic liposomes in both cell lines (Table 1). For instance, the increase
in the mean fluorescence intensity produced by MLPs was more than
twice (8.46 vs 3.83) that obtained with bare liposomes in HeLa cells.
Not less surprising, PEGylated liposomes (with or without iron oxide
nanoparticles) produced the lowest values for cell binding. Although
all of the systems become aggregated as a consequence of their interaction
with the media components, the kinetics of the aggregation is different,
and for that reason, the MLPs are probably taken up quicker than the
functionalized samples. Internalization of these nanoparticles was
investigated by confocal microscopy, and the results were wholly consistent
with those obtained with flow cytometry. Figures 7 and 8 demonstrate
that time was a key factor in the internalization process; the highest
degree of internalization of MLPs in HeLa cells was seen at 4 h of
incubation, whereas the highest internalization in 3T3 cells was observed
at 24 h. After internalization, nanoparticles are initially confined
inside endosomes, which are submicrometric vesicles of the endocytic
pathway.40,41 Therefore, the red areas in Figure 7 show MLPs that have been internalized
into endosomal compartments. RGD-MLPs were poorly internalized in
3T3 cells and not at all in HeLa cells at any of the time points examined.
These results supported our flow cytometry data but are not in line
with most of the other studies on RGD.9,26,29,42,43 The absence of RGD-MLP internalization could be because RGD-MLPs
remain primarily linked to the cell surface, with the repeated washes
performed before the microscopic experiments causing the nanoparticles
to detach from the cell surface. Previous studies have demonstrated
that nanoparticle internalization in HeLa lines strongly depends on
the nanoparticle coating charge, nature, concentration, and incubation
time.44,45 Thus, nanoparticles with low surface charge
or negative charge are hardly endocytosed by these cells, partly explaining
the lack of internalization of RGD-MLPs, which display a low surface
charge. By contrast, cationic nanoparticles were detected inside the
cells under all experimental conditions.

We observed greater
internalization of MLPs than that of their
nonmagnetic counterparts, the reasons for which remain unclear. The
extremely low cellular uptake of RGD-MLPs (or RGD-liposomes) in HeLa
cells despite the specific targeting could be explained by the presence
of PEG. PEGylation has been, for many years, used to avoid the interaction
between any carrier and the components of biological fluids. Although
PEGylated carriers are effectively delivered to tumor tissue via an
EPR effect, the cellular uptake efficiency of PEGylated carriers is
known to be low. This problem is recognized as the PEG dilemma.46−48 It has been shown that PEGylation diminishes the absolute amount
of protein bound to the liposomes but does not impede the formation
of the protein layer surrounding the liposome (the protein corona).49 To overcome this drawback and enhance the cellular
uptake efficiency of PEGylated carriers, ligands targeting surface
proteins on cancer cells have been attached to the tip of PEG.50,51 The aim of our study was to facilitate and increase the cellular
uptake of nanoparticles by incorporating RGD. However, as we have
demonstrated, RGD-MLP internalization was almost similar to the uptake
of their PEGylated counterparts despite the presence of the ligand.
It is evident that these PEGylated systems, with longer circulation
time in the bloodstream, interact inefficiently with cell membranes.
In other words, when PEG is attached to the liposomal surface, the
designed active targeting is masked. Therefore, it is necessary to
find the best compromise between an antiopsonization strategy and
efficient cellular uptake because an optimal balance between PEGylation
and RGD loading is required for targeting in vivo. In some cases,
higher RGD loading could be applied to increase cell binding (or similarly,
a reduction in PEGylation could be used to increase binding), whereas
in others, the use of ligand-targeted liposomes without PEG or with
a shorter-chain PEG could be a reasonable strategy.52

Conclusions
The cellular uptake of MLPs is strongly
related not only to the
surface grafting of the nanoparticle but also to the presence of encapsulated
iron nanoparticles. While PEGylation inhibits internalization, the
targeting RGD moiety does not favor internalization, even in cells
with RGD receptors. Furthermore, bare MLPs are internalized more than
the other types of MLPs, regardless of the cell type. Therefore, the
cellular uptake of ligand-targeted MLPs is inhibited by PEG. To achieve
cell interaction and internalization of targeting nanoparticles, their
surfaces have to display ligands that exceed the length of the polymer
chain to prevent the protein corona impeding the binding ability of
the ligand. However, it seems more straightforward to use two PEG
chains of different lengths.53,54 The short PEG chains
afford the steric stability of the nanoparticles, whereas the longer
ones help locating the ligand. Consequently, the long arm facilitates
the interaction with the cellular receptor, whereas the short arm
prevents the adsorption of proteins on the particles’ surface.
In this way, the ligands must be attached at the tip of a PEG chain
longer than the PEG chains used to provide steric stabilization.

Experimental
Procedures
Synthesis and Characterization of Magnetoliposomes
Iron oxide magnetic ferrofluid was synthesized by coprecipitating
two iron salts in the presence of PEG with a molecular weight of 6000
Da, as described by García-Jimeno and Estelrich.55 MLPs were prepared with DMPC (P7930, Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO) and CHOL (C8667, Sigma-Aldrich) at an 80:20 molar ratio.
PEG-MLPs were made with DMPC, CHOL, and DSPE-PEG2000 (880160P, Avanti
Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL). RGD-MNPs were prepared with DMPC, CHOL,
and DSPE-PEG2000 (880160P, Avanti Polar Lipids), as well as maleimide-PEG-DSPE
(DSPE-PEG-MAL) (880126P, Avanti Polar Lipids), and modified with RGD.
The cyclic RGD peptide (Arg-Gly-Asp-d-Phe-Cys, purity assayed
by HPLC to be >99%) was obtained from Caslo (Lyngby, Denmark).
Lipids
used either for MNPs or for RGD-MNPs were dried by evaporating at
reduced pressure (Rotovapor R-200, Buchi, Switzerland) at 40 °C.
The obtained lipid films were hydrated with a suspension of ferrofluid
in water at an iron concentration of 0.67 mg/mL (12 mM). Liposomes
were obtained by sequential extrusion through polycarbonate membranes
with pore sizes of 800 nm (3 times), 400 nm (3 times), and 200 nm
(4 times) in an Extruder device (Avestin, Ottawa, Canada). The nonencapsulated
ferrofluid was separated from MLPs by adding an equal volume of 320
mM NaCl. The nonincorporated ferrofluid was precipitated by gentle
centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant contained the
purified MLPs. RGD-MLPs were prepared similarly: DMPC/CHOL/DSPE-PEG-MAL
were mixed at molar ratios of 80:20:3 and hydrated with a suspension
of the ferrofluid. Once the liposomes were extruded and purified,
RGD dissolved in water was coupled to the corresponding liposomal
surface by a chemical reaction at room temperature overnight between
the maleimide groups at the distal end of DSPE-PEG-MAL on the liposomes
and the sulfhydryl group of cysteine in the cyclic RGD, at a molar
ratio of 1:10 (RGD/maleimide).27 To determine
the cellular uptake of liposomes by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry,
liposomes were labeled with fluorescence probe 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(lissamine
Rho sulfonyl) (ammonium salt) (810157C, Avanti Polar Lipids). The
probe in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) was added to the organic lipid
mixture and proceeded as indicated above. The microscopic images were
acquired in probe-corrected Jeol ARM-200 equipped with a field emission
gun electron source operating at 200 kV. Z-contrast images were collected
using an HAADF detector, in scanning transmission mode (STEM). Particle
size distribution and ζ-potential were determined by PCS using
Zetasizer Nano (Malvern, U.K.). The magnetic properties of the magnetic
particles were evaluated using a superconducting quantum interference
device magnetometer (Quantum design MPMS XL). Phospholipid and iron
concentrations in the liposomal samples were determined by the Steward56 and Kiwada57 methods,
respectively.

Cell Culture
The 3T3 (murine Swiss
albino embryo fibroblasts)
and HeLa (human epithelial cervical cancer) cell lines were obtained
from Eucellbank (Universitat de Barcelona). Cells were routinely cultured
in 75 cm2 culture flasks and grown in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (56499C, Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented
with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS) (10082, Invitrogen),
4.5 g/L glucose, 2 mM l-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and
100 mg/mL streptomycin (“complete medium”) at 37 °C
and 5% CO2. After cells became ∼80% confluent, they
were removed from the culture flask by trypsinization (0.25% trypsin
+ 0.1% EDTA) and suspended in complete medium.

Cell Viability
Quantitative viability of the 3T3 and
HeLa cells in the presence of MNPs was assessed using the MTT and
NR assays, as described elsewhere.58 The
first measures metabolic activity in the mitochondria of viable cells,59 whereas NR accumulates in the lysosomes of viable
undamaged cells.60 3T3 cells (1 ×
105 cells mL–1) and HeLa cells (5 ×
104 cells mL–1) were seeded onto a 96-well
plate in 100 μL of complete medium. After subculturing for 24
h at 37 °C and 5% CO2, the medium was replaced with
100 μL of fresh medium supplemented with 5% FCS containing the
MLPs in the phospholipid concentration range of 0.08–10 mM
(with an iron content ranging from 0.03 to 4 mM). The control group
consisted of cells in DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum
without MLPs. Experiments were carried out in triplicate. After exposure
for 24 h to MLPs, PEG-MLPs, or RGD-MLPs, the nanoparticles were removed.
Subsequently, 100 μL of MTT solution (1 mg mL–1), previously diluted with DMEM without FCS or phenol red, was added
to each well at a final concentration of 0.5 mg mL–1. After 3 h of incubation at 37 °C, the MTT solution was removed
by aspiration and 100 μL of dimethyl sulfoxide was added to
each well to dissolve the purple formazan crystals. Plates were then
placed in a microtiter plate shaker and gently shaken for 10 min at
room temperature to achieve complete dissolution. Finally, the absorbance
of each well was measured at 550 nm using a Bio-Rad 550 microplate
reader. Cell viability was expressed as the percentages of viable
cells compared with the survival rates of the control group (untreated
cells showed 100% viability). In the NR assay, after incubating cells
with MLPs for 24 h, an additional incubation for 3 h was performed
with an NR solution (50 μg mL–1) in DMEM without
FCS or phenol red. Cells were then washed with PBS, followed by the
addition of 100 μL of a solution containing 50% absolute ethanol
and 1% acetic acid in distilled water to extract NR. Plates were gently
shaken for 10 min to ensure complete dissolution, and the absorbance
of the extracted solution was read at 550 nm as above. The effect
of each type of MLP was calculated as the percentage of NR uptake
by lysosomes compared to that in control (untreated cells). Viability
was determined as in the MTT assay.

Flow Cytometry
The interaction between the MLPs and
3T3 or HeLa cells was determined by flow cytometry. 3T3 cells (1 ×
105 cells mL–1) and HeLa cells (5 ×
104 cells mL–1) were seeded onto 24-well
plates in 500 μL of complete medium. The cells were then incubated
for 24 h at 37 °C under 5% CO2. The medium was replaced
with 500 μL of fresh DMEM supplemented with 5% FCS containing
the MLPs at a phospholipid concentration of 0.6 mM. After 4 h of incubation,
the MLPs were removed and the cells were washed three times with PBS
and harvested with trypsin/EDTA (100 μL) for 3–5 min
at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Cells were resuspended in 500
μL of fresh DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and analyzed by flow
cytometry using a FACSAria I SORP sorter (Becton Dickinson, San Jose,
CA). Excitation of the sample was achieved using a blue laser (488
nm) for forward scatter (FS). A green laser (561 nm) was used to excite
Rho present in the bilayer of MLPs, and the red emission (575 ±
12.5 nm) was collected in log modes. Cells were gated by sideward
scatter (SS) versus forward scatter (FS) and selected according to
their FS/SS signal. Fluorescence measurements were undertaken according
to this gate. A minimum of 10 000 (3T3 cells) or 3900 (HeLa
cells) gated events were collected and analyzed. Dot blot analysis
was performed using the software supplied by the manufacturer. All
experiments were repeated twice, but results are presented from a
single experiment.

Confocal Microscopy
Cell adhesion
and MLP localization
in both cell lines were assessed by confocal microscopy using a Leica
TCS–SP2 laser scanning confocal microscope (Heidelberg, Germany).
The cell membrane was stained with the cell-membrane-impermeable dye
Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated WGA in ice-cold PBS for 10 min. The nucleus
was stained using membrane-permeable dye Hoechst 33342 (L7528, Invitrogen).
Cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, and the coverslips
with the cells were mounted on glass slides onto ProLong Gold antifade
reagent. For every sample, 15-z scans (horizontal
cross section of a cell at a particular z height)
were taken at a 0.25 μm z-step height to cover
the entire height of the cell. On the confocal images, liposomes are
shown in red, the cell membrane, in green, and the nucleus, in blue.
