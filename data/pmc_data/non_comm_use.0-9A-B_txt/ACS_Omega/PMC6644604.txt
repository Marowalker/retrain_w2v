All-oxide thermoelectric modules
for energy harvesting are attractive
because of high-temperature stability, low cost, and the potential
to use nonscarce and nontoxic elements. Thermoelectric modules are
mostly fabricated in the conventional π-design, associated with
the challenge of unstable metallic interconnects at high temperature.
Here, we report on a novel approach for fabrication of a thermoelectric
module with an in situ formed p–p–n junction made of
state-of-the-art oxides Ca3Co4–xO9+δ (p-type) and CaMnO3–CaMn2O4 composite (n-type). The module was fabricated
by spark plasma co-sintering of p- and n-type powders partly separated
by insulating LaAlO3. Where the n- and p-type materials
originally were in contact, a layer of p-type Ca3CoMnO6 was formed in situ. The hence formed p–p–n
junction exhibited Ohmic behavior and a transverse thermoelectric
effect, boosting the open-circuit voltage of the module. The performance
of the module was characterized at 700–900 °C, with the
highest power output of 5.7 mW (around 23 mW/cm2) at 900
°C and a temperature difference of 160 K. The thermoelectric
properties of the p- and n-type materials were measured in the temperature
range 100–900 °C, where the highest zT of 0.39 and 0.05 were obtained at 700 and 800 °C, respectively,
for Ca3Co4–xO9+δ and the CaMnO3–CaMn2O4 composite.

1 Introduction
Energy
harvesting from waste heat from, for example, combustion
engines or metallurgical processes or other industry has great potential
for energy savings and emission reductions. Thermoelectric generators
(TEGs) present a promising technology for such energy recovery.1 A TEG is based on two dissimilar materials (p-
and n-types) connected together and when exposed to a temperature
gradient, converts thermal energy into electrical energy.1,2 Power density (Pdensity) and the figure
of merit (zT) are used to evaluate TE modules and
their consisting p- and n-type materials, respectively. Figure of
merit for any p- or n-type material can be calculate using 1  where S, σ, and κ
represent Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, and thermal
conductivity, respectively.3 In a conventional
module (π-design), p- and n-type materials are connected electrically
in series and thermally in parallel, with conductive metallic interconnects
between legs (mostly Ag or Au).4,5 Conventional modules
normally suffer from limited temperature, which obstructs the high-temperature
advantage of oxides. Furthermore, conventional modules demonstrate
short lifetimes because of the instability of the metallic interconnects
and even at low temperature resulting in a decrease in power output
as a function of time.6 All-oxide TE modules
with direct oxide–oxide p–n junction would therefore
be beneficial. However, such direct p–n junction will normally
have high resistance because of charge carrier depletion in the space
charge regions.7

Shin et al. demonstrated
for the first time the prototype of a
direct p–n oxide module using Li-doped NiO and (Ba, Sr)PbO3, and 14 mW at ΔT = 552 K was achieved.8 Later, Hayashi et al. reported a stacked module
with direct p–n oxide junctions based on p-type (La1.97Sr0.03)CuO4 and n-type (Nd1.97Ce0.03)CuO4, where the maximum power density obtained
from 25 pairs was 40 mW/cm2 at 400 °C and ΔT = 360 K.9 Moreover, Funahashi
et al. demonstrated a module using a nonoxide p-type Ni0.9Mo0.1 and n-type La0.035Sr0.965TiO3,10 where the maximum obtained
power density from 50 pairs was 450 mW/cm2 at ΔT = 360 K. Furthermore, Chavez et al. showed another concept
of using large-area p–n junctions (containing no insulator)
as a TE module where 1.3 mW was generated from one pair at ΔT = 300 K.11 The chemical compatibility,
long-term stability, and electrical performance of the p–n
junctions/modules were not considered in these studies.

Ca3Co4–xO9+δ (CCO) has a misfit-layered complex crystal structure containing
triangular CoO2 and rock-salt Ca2CoO3 layers.12 CCO shows p-type conductivity
and exhibits excellent thermoelectric (TE) power at elevated temperatures
in ambient air.13 CaMnO3−δ (CMO) has a perovskite structure and exhibits n-type conductivity
resulting from an intrinsic oxygen deficiency. By introducing a secondary
CaMn2O4 spinel phase, the TE properties of the
CaMnO3−δ–CaMn2O4 composite are improved compared with single phase CaMnO3−δ, as observed in our research group. TE properties of these oxides
can further be improved by doping or co-doping.14 So far, only a few reports on conventional modules based
on the CCO–CMO-based system are available.15−22 Besides high-temperature TE modules, there are recently reported
promising low-temperature organic-based TE modules, containing flexible
layered design.23,24

Here, we report on high-temperature
TE performance for an all-oxide
TE module based on the system p-type Ca3Co4–xO9+δ (CCO) and n-type CaMnO3–CaMn2O4 (CMO-composite). LaAlO3 (LAO) was selected as the electrical insulating component
because of its ferroelastic properties25 and high thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) compared with other
potential insulating oxide candidates. Undoped CCO and a CMO-composite
were selected as model materials in this work focusing on developing
processing methods of the layered module and thereby analyzing the
effect of a direct oxide–oxide p–n junction at high-temperature
on TE performance of the module. The performance of the module critically
depends on the properties of an in situ formed complex p–p–n
junction, which was studied with respect to stability, interdiffusion,
compatibility, and electrical conductivity. Finally, we report on
an environment friendly processing method for all-oxide TE devices
based on aqueous tape casting and co-sintering of the three materials
using spark plasma sintering (SPS).

2 Results
2.1 Powder Characteristics
X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns of CCO, CMO-composite, and LAO powders are presented
in Figure 1a, confirming
the phase purity of CCO and LAO as well as the composite nature of
the CMO-composite (CaMnO3 with minor amount of CaMn2O4 secondary phase). XRD patterns of polycrystalline
CCO prepared by SPS are also included in Figure 1a, both parallel and perpendicular to the
pressing direction. A high degree of texture is observed (c oriented parallel to the pressing direction) as well as
small amounts of Ca3Co2O6 and Co3O4 secondary phases. Fine-grained powders of the
three starting oxides are confirmed from the scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images in Figure 1b. Sintering curves for the CCO, CMO-composite, and LAO powders shown
in Figure 1c demonstrate
the onset of sintering at around 650, 900, and 1000 °C for CCO,
CMO-composite, and LAO, respectively. TECs of CCO (perpendicular and
parallel to pressing direction during SPS), CMO-composite, and LAO
are summarized in Table 1. CCO and CMO-composite show similar TECs while LAO has a significantly
lower value.

2.2 TE Performance of the Materials
Electrical
conductivity, thermal conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, power factor,
and zT as a function of temperature for the p- and
n-type oxides are presented in Figure 2. CCO shows a maximum electrical conductivity in the
range of 500–600 °C, reaching approximately 100 S cm–1 (Figure 2a). On the other hand, the electrical conductivity of the
CMO-composite has a constant value of 7 S cm–1 up
to 600 °C from where it increases to 28 S cm–1 at 900 °C. The thermal conductivity of both materials decreases
with temperature, reaching minima of 0.85 W m–1 K–1 at 700 °C for CCO and 1.42 W m–1 K–1 at 800 °C for the CMO-composite (Figure 2b). The sudden drop
in thermal conductivity for CCO above 600 °C is most probably
due to phonon–phonon interactions between the a–b plane and c direction
due to the anisotropic crystal structure and texturing of the sample.
A maximum Seebeck coefficient of 186 μV K–1 at 500 °C for CCO and −325 μV K–1 at 400 °C for the CMO-composite (Figure 2c) was achieved. A maximum power factor for
CCO (3.6 μW cm–1 K–2) was
obtained at ∼500 °C. The figure-of-merit, zT, presented in Figure 2d increased with temperature, reaching 0.39 at 700 °C for CCO
and 0.05 at 800 °C for the CMO-composite. The electrical conductivity
and Seebeck coefficients were measured in the direction perpendicular
to the pressing direction, whereas the thermal conductivity was recorded
parallel to the pressing direction of the sample. The measurements
in the two different orientations resulted in a higher zT than the real one because the reported thermal conductivity of CCO
is strongly anisotropic.29

coefficient, and (d) zT (full symbols) and power

ceramics. Error bars represent standard deviation based on five (Seebeck
coefficient) and three (thermal conductivity) measured values. The
uncertainty in electrical conductivity is smaller than the symbols
and less than ±1%.

2.3 TE Module
Schematic of the cross
section of the TE module design is shown in Figure 3a. The thickness of the CMO-composite after
co-sintering is approximately four times larger than the thickness
of the CCO layer. Resistance, R, of both conductors
was calculated by the formula R = ρ·l/A where ρ is electrical
resistivity (cm·S–1), l is
height/length (cm), and A is area (cm2). The electrical resistance of CMO-composite at, for example, 800
°C is about 1.6 more than one of CCO, and therefore, the CMO-composite
represents more electrically resistive part in spite of larger thickness
compared with CCO and limits the charge carrier flow. Because of the
significant increase in electrical conductivity of CMO-composite above
800 °C, and slight decrease of CCO, the electrical resistance
of the CMO-composite at 900 °C is about 0.7 times less than one
of CCO; hence, the CCO represents more electrically resistive part.

top part and bottom part (p- and n-type materials separated by an
insulator, i) as well as flow direction of heat at top part (b) polynomial
fitting of electrical power output (Pel) and linear fitting of voltage (U) as a function
of the electrical current (Jq) at different Thot temperatures (700, 800, and 900 °C)
and constant ΔT = 160 K. Voltage and current
at maximum power U(Pmax) and Jq(Pmax) at different temperatures are also
indicated by dotted lines.

Voltage (polynomial fitting) and power output of the TE module
as a function of measured current output are shown in Figure 3b. Dashed lines represent current
and voltage at maximum power at 700, 800, and 900 °C at the hot
side of the module. Power output increases with temperature, reaching
a maximum of about 5.7 mW at 900 °C. The effective power density
of about 23 mW/cm2 at this temperature was calculated from
the effective area of TE module (approximately 0.25 cm2).

Open-circuit voltage UOC and
short-circuit
current Jq,SC were determined by extrapolation
from the measured Jq–U line and reached 213 mV and 108 mA at 900 °C, respectively.
Data from the characterization of the TE module performance are summarized
in Table 2.

800	208	101	2.1	5.2	21	
900	213	108	2.0	5.7	23	
Because the power output is dependent on load resistance,
the maximum
power output could be measured when the set-up-load from an external
circuit of 5.7 Ω became equal to the TE module’s resistance
of about 2.1 Ω (at 800 °C).30 The calculated figure of merit of the module (ZT) is 0.01, using 2  where UOC, Jq,SC, and Rmodule represents open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current, and resistance
of the module, respectively.31

2.4 p–p–n Junction
The
microstructure of the CCO–CCMO–CMO p–p–n
junction before and after annealing at 900 °C for 100 h is shown
in Figure 4a. Elongated
grain growth parallel to the interface is evident in CCO. A thin Ca3CoMnO6 (CCMO) layer, confirmed by energy-dispersive
spectrometry (EDS), is formed in situ between CCO and CMO during the
co-sintering. The CCMO layer has grown to approximately 5 μm
after annealing at 900 °C for 100 h. In addition, a layer of
approximately 35 μm thickness close to the interface displayed
a higher density than the rest of the CCO. From the EDS profiles of
the CCO–CMO interface presented in Figure 4b, the Ca content in this dense layer is
lower than that in CCO showing a Co-rich and a Ca-deficient region
at the interface. The Ca/Co ratio equals the initial Ca/Co ratio corresponding
to pure CCO approximately 40 μm from the interface. A Co-oxide
phase seen as grains with higher Co-content in Figure 4a is present both in the dense interface
layer as well as in the CCO far from the interface.

and after annealing at 900 °C for 100 h and EDS maps of the magnified

annealing.

Current–voltage curves
across the CCO–CCMO–CMO
complex junction before and after annealing at 900 °C for 100
h, measured at 300, 500, and 700 °C are presented in Figure 5a. Ohmic behavior
is observed in the whole temperature range for both as-sintered and
annealed junctions, and the resistance decreases with increasing temperature.
The difference in the resistance for the as-sintered and annealed
samples is less pronounced as the temperature increases, and at 700
°C almost no difference is observed (inset in Figure 5b).

samples according to the Arrhenius equation, where the annealed sample
demonstrates twice the activation energy of the as-sintered.

3 Discussion
3.1 Ceramic Processing
A new co-sintering
route to an all-oxide TE module was developed. The maximum sintering
temperature was limited by the decomposition temperature of CCO. Moreover,
CMO possesses a phase transition at 896–913 °C32 from orthorhombic to tetragonal phase associated
with a volume change, which also could introduce stresses in the device.
Therefore, 880 °C was selected as the maximum co-sintering temperature.
Because this temperature is low for efficient densification of CMO-composite
and LAO (Figure 1c),
a maximum pressure of 75 MPa was applied in the SPS with optimal 5
min hold, which resulted in 70 and 46% relative density for CMO-composite
and LAO, respectively. CCO was completely densified after 2 min at
880 °C, but due to grain growth and micro-delamination, the final
density after 5 min was 91% of theoretical. The CMO-composite possesses
the highest TEC of the three materials (Table 1) and tensional stress is induced during
cooling; hence, the CMO-composite represents the most sensitive part
of the module during processing being prone to crack formation. The
crack formation could be controlled by designing a thin CCO (∼0.8
mm) and thick CMO (∼3.6 mm) layer reducing the tensile stresses
in the CMO-composite. The calculated tensile stresses in the CMO-composite
(Supporting Information, Figure S2) developed
during the cooling from 880 °C decreases both with increasing
CMO-composite thickness and decreasing CCO thickness.33

3.2 Origins of High Power Output
and Open-Circuit
Voltage
As evident from Table 3, there are large differences in the output power of
conventionally designed CCO–CMO TE modules dependent on whether
CCO and CMO are doped or (like in our case) undoped, as well as on
the applied temperatures and gradients.

based on the data available in the given references.

Urata et al.17 reported as much as 42.5
mW cm–2 for a doped system with a Thot of about 900 °C and a gradient as high as 565
K, while undoped CCO–CMO systems at lower temperature and gradients
of 200 K yielded merely 3.3 mW cm–2 (Phaga et al.16) and 23.7 × 10–3 mW cm–2 (Seetawan et al.15).

Our prototype TE module with undoped CCO–CMO and a complex
p–p–n junction could not be exposed to a larger ΔT than 160 K due to limitations of the set-up. Yet, a maximum
power density of about 23 mW cm–2 was generated
at 900 °C. We attribute this to the remarkably high open-circuit
voltage and low interface resistance of the complex p–p–n
junction, as will be discussed next.

According to Kanas et al.,
electrical conductivity of the CCMO
phase formed at the interface increases sharply with increasing temperature
from 800 to 900 °C and reaches around 0.1 S cm–1 at 900 °C, where the positive Seebeck coefficient furthermore
reaches as high as 668 μV K–1.34 The three-layered CCO–CCMO–CMO
junction exhibits Ohmic behavior with relatively modest interfacial
resistance above 700 °C as evidenced in Figure 5a. We tentatively interpret this as an effect
of the electron energy levels of CCMO as laying intermediate of those
of CCO and CMO, hence decreasing the depletion of charge carriers
at the CCO–CCMO and CCMO–CMO interfaces as compared
to a hypothetical pristine CCO–CMO p–n interface. This
facilitates an electrical current flow through the p–p–n
interface as illustrated in Figure 3a.

The CCMO reaction layer is thicker in the
annealed sample compared
with the as-sintered one (Figure 4a), and in the temperature range 300–500 °C,
resistivity is higher for the annealed sample (Figure 5). At 700 °C, the resistivity of both
samples are almost equal (Figure 5), showing that the same concentration of charges will
be excited to conduction level because of thermal activation, demonstrating
no effect of CCMO thickness on the current density above 700 °C.
The CCMO layer is therefore contributing equally to the electrical
conduction process at this high temperature.

When two materials
A and B dissimilar in thermal conductivity and
Seebeck coefficient are contacted over an area exposed to a parallel
thermal gradient, a voltage is generated in the transversal direction,
and an effective transversal Seebeck coefficient of the couple can
be expressed according to Goldsmid35 3  where SA, SB, KA, and KB represent the Seebeck coefficients and thermal
resistances of the two materials. In our case, the thermal conductivity
of CCO at 900 °C is 0.94 W m–1 K–1 while that for CCMO is 1.3 W m–1 K–134 and the CMO-composite is 2.0 W m–1 K–1. This will give rise to different
heat flows down the n- and p-type materials, resulting in an increasing
transversal temperature gradient down the CCMO interface layer corresponding
to the transversal heat flow illustrated in Figure 3a.

For the following discussion, the
module may be divided into a
top hot part above the LAO insulator and a bottom conventional part.
The top part contains three material layers and two subjunctions which
contribute to a transversal TE voltage according to eq 3, whereas the bottom part contributes
to standard longitudinal TE voltages. On the basis of the dimensions
of the module, we may estimate a temperature difference of 40 K over
the top part and the remaining 120 K cover the bottom part. Because
the Seebeck coefficient of CMO is strongly influenced by temperature
(Figure 2c), average
values are used for summing up all possible contributions from materials
and interfaces in the transversal and longitudinal parts. We arrive
at an estimated open-circuit potential of 125 mV, as compared to the
estimate of 64 mV from a regular CCO and CMO couple with a total gradient
of 160 K, based on their Seebeck coefficients of +177 and −171
μV K–1 (at 900 °C) and about +179 and
−270 μV K–1 (at approximately 740 °C),
respectively. Average absolute values of the Seebeck coefficient and
thermal conductivity of CCO and CMO for the top and bottom parts of
the module used for the calculations are 178 μV K–1 (CCObottom), 177 μV K–1 (CCOtop), 0.89 W m–1 K–1 (CCOtop), 229 μV K–1 (CMObottom), 189 μV K–1 (CMOtop), and 1.88
W m–1 K–1 (CMOtop).
A transversal TE effect occurs when anisotropy in the electrical and
thermal transport occurs,35 as in our top
part of the module. This phenomenon is beneficially used for enhancing
the voltage in transversal TE modules and related applications.36−40 For instance, the transversal TE voltage in CaxCoO2 textured thin films can be significantly higher
than the ones generated by regular TE effect.36−38 The transversal
voltage significantly affected the open-circuit voltage UOC and the maximum electrical power output Pel. The presence of a transverse TE effect can also be
observed by comparison of UOC of the TE
module (Figure 3b)
and Seebeck coefficient together with the power factor of individual
materials from 700 to 900 °C. The Seebeck coefficients (Figure 2c) of the two individual
materials decrease as temperature increases, as well as power factor
of CCO (Figure 2d),
whereas UOC of TE module increases with
temperature (Figure 3b). The experimentally measured UOC of
213 mV is hence remarkably larger than both theoretical estimates.
Further experimental and theoretical studies (e.g., field emission
microscopy simulations) will be necessary to fully understand the
effect of thin layers of materials with high Seebeck coefficients
in the interface of p–n TE junctions. However, the in situ
formed complex p–p–n junctions evidently improved the
performance of the all-oxide TE module, hence representing a significant
step forward toward the possible application of oxide TE modules in
high-temperature energy recovery.

4 Conclusions
A novel all-oxide TE module was successfully developed and fabricated
by careful processing of materials in the CCO–CMO system using
LAO as an electrical insulator. Fabrication of this all-oxide TE module
is simpler and faster than assembling conventional modules. The CCO–CMO
module demonstrated a power of about 5.7 mW corresponding to a power
density of 23 mW cm–2 at Thot = 900 °C and ΔT = 160 K, a
TE performance comparable and better than some conventional CCO–CMO
modules. The all-oxide layered TE module produces a large open-circuit
voltage, which was attributed to the presence of a thin CCMO reaction
layer and transversal TE effect across the top p–p–n
part of the TE module. The effect of the CCMO reaction layer is due
to the large Seebeck coefficient, working transversally and reducing
the charge carrier depletion and resistance at the high-temperature
p–n junction. The present investigation demonstrates an example
of novel engineering of oxide TE modules without metallic interconnects.

5 Experimental Section
5.1 Materials and Ceramic Processing
The ceramic powders used in this work were prepared by spray pyrolysis
(CerPoTech AS, Norway). Slurry for aqueous tape casting of the LAO
insulator was prepared according to the schematics shown in Figure
S1 (Supporting Information). The slurry
was casted on a polyester (Mylar) film using a height of the doctor
blade of 30 μm. After drying at ambient temperature, lamination
of 8 layers was conducted by hot-pressing at 150 MPa and 80 °C
for 3 min. The laminated tape was cut into 12 mm discs with one segment
cut off (around 3 mm) to make the direct p–n junction. Binder
burnout was done at 440 °C for 4 h in air, placing the tape between
two alumina plates to avoid bending. The TE module was fabricated
by SPS (Dr. Sinter 825) in a 12 mm graphite die at 880 °C and
75 MPa for 5 min using heating and cooling rates of 120 °C/min.
Initially, the graphite die was filled with the CMO-composite powder
(1.5 g), and then the cut LAO tape was placed on CMO-composite powder,
followed by filling of CCO powder (0.5 g) onto the LAO tape.

In addition, CMO-composite and CCO materials were separately sintered
by SPS using the same conditions as used for the TE module. These
pellets were cut into a bar-shape (20 × 5 × 2.5 mm) for
electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient measurements and discs
(12.7 mm diameter) for thermal conductivity measurements. Densities
of pellets and bars were determined by Archimedes measurement in isopropanol.
To do a separate analysis of the direct CCO–CMO-composite junction,
two samples were prepared by SPS co-sintering at 820 °C and 50
MPa for 10 min. One of these samples was further annealed at 900 °C
for 100 h in air.

5.2 Characterization
Phase composition
and particle size/morphology were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction
(Bruker D8 DAVINCI) and SEM (Hitachi S-3400N), respectively. Sinterability
and TEC were determined by dilatometer (Netzsch DIL 402) in ambient
air. TEC was measured both parallel and perpendicular to the pressing
direction for CCO made by SPS. TE performance of CCO and CMO materials
were analyzed by measuring Seebeck coefficient (ProboStat, NorECs
AS), electrical conductivity (home-made setup) and thermal conductivity
(Netzsch LFA 457 MicroFlash) at 100–900 °C in ambient
air as described elsewhere.41,42

For the power–current–voltage
characterization, the layered disc-shaped TE module was placed horizontally
on an alumina plate with the direct p–n junction at the top
(hot temperature side).

To ensure better physical stability
of the free-standing module,
a small area of about 0.25 cm2 was removed on the cold
side. Both semiconductors were contacted by Pt-wires at the lower,
colder end, using gold paste (Heraeus). The alumina plate with the
TE module connected to Pt-wires was heated at 700 °C for 4 h
in ambient air, to establish good electrical contact between the metal
electrodes and semiconducting oxides.

The power output test
in ambient air was performed via load resistance-dependent
measurement, in a vertical furnace at 700, 800, and 900 °C, and
ΔT = 160 K. The temperature gradient was established
by heating the hot side of the module in the furnace, whereas the
cold side was cooled by an active cooler. The temperature difference
ΔT was measured by two Pt–Pt10Rh (type
S) thermocouples. During the power output measurement, the voltmeter
was connected parallel to the amperemeter, variable resistor (in series
to each other), and to the TE module. When thermal equilibria were
established at each temperature, electrical current and voltage were
measured with increasing load resistance. More details could be found
in ref (4).

Finally,
annealed and as-sintered p–n junctions were characterized
by current–voltage measurements at 300, 500, and 700 °C
in a vertical furnace, using a ProboStat cell (NORECS, Norway). A
two-electrode set-up was used, where a dc voltage was applied to the
junction followed by measuring current output using Multimeter-Agilent
E3642A. After the measurements, the samples were embedded in “EpoFix”
resin, polished by diamond paste (DiaPro NapB1) to 1 μm and
coated with carbon (Cressington Carbon Coater 208) for microstructural
characterization. Interface reaction and interdiffusion at the p–n
junction were investigated using SEM and EDS (Hitachi S-3400N).
