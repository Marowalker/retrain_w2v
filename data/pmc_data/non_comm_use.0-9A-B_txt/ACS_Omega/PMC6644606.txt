Pneumolysin (PLY) and its truncated
fragments, domains 1–3
(D1–3), and domain 4 (D4), were purified
as recombinant proteins after being cloned and over-expressed in Escherichia coli. The three-dimensional structures
of these proteins were quantitatively investigated in a biomimetic
condition, phosphate buffered saline (PBS) by synchrotron X-ray scattering.
X-ray scattering analysis revealed important structural features including
structural parameters. PLY was present as a monomeric form in PBS.
The monomeric form resembled its crystallographic structure with a
discrepancy of only 6.3%, confirming that PLY forms a stable structure
and, thus, retains its structure in the crystalline state and even
in PBS solution. D4 was also present as a monomeric form,
but its structure was very different from that of the corresponding
part in the crystallographic PLY structure; the discrepancy was 92.0%.
Such a dissimilar structure might originate from a less folded-chain
conformation. This result suggested that the structure of D4 is highly dependent on the crystalline or solution state and further
on the presence or absence of the D1–3 unit. In
contrast, D1–3 was dimeric rather than monomeric.
Its structure was close to the most probable dimeric form of the corresponding
part in the crystallographic PLY structure with 13.1% discrepancy.
This fact indicated that the D1–3 unit forms a stable
structure and, indeed, such structure is well maintained in the crystalline
state as well as in PBS although presented as a dimer. This result
further supported that the whole structural stability of PLY is mainly
attributed to the structure of D1–3. All of PLY,
D1–3, and D4 revealed aggregation tendencies
during purification and storage. Overall, the structural characteristics
of PLY and its domains in PBS may correlate to the PLY oligomer formation
yielding large pore structures for the penetration of cell membranes.

==== Body
Introduction
Streptococcus pneumoniae is a Gram-positive
bacterium, which is known as a major human pathogen causing systemic
infections (pneumonia, meningitis, bacteremia) as well as local infections
(sinusitis, otitis media).1−8S. pneumoniae has been recognized
as the most common causative pathogen of bacterial pneumonia in children
(<5 years) and elderly people (>65 years) and is a major cause
of morbidity and mortality worldwide.3−8

S. pneumoniae produces several
virulence
factors including polysaccharide capsules, surface proteins, and pneumolysin.3−8 In particular, pneumolysin (PLY) is a member of the thiol-activated,
cholesterol-dependent cytolysin family of toxins and plays a major
role in causing invasive pneumococcal infections.3−9 PLY was found to form transmembrane channels in cholesterol-containing
membranes of human cells, causing the target cells’ lysis.10−18 For such pore formation on the cell membrane, it was known that
30–50 PLY monomers oligomerize via interaction with cholesterol
molecules in cell membranes, forming a very large size ring structure
of 260 Å in diameter.11,16,18

PLY is a 53 kDa protein consisting of 471 amino acid residues.19 Its crystal structure was recently determined;16−18 better quality crystals could be achieved when PLY was mutated with
substitutions Asp385Asn and Cys432Ala.16 X-ray crystallography analyses confirmed that PLY is composed of
four domains (D1, D2, D3, and D4) where D1, D2, and D3 are
contiguous and connected to the C-terminal D4 via D2. Its solution structure was further examined.17,20 However, the solution structure was analyzed qualitatively rather
than quantitatively. Thus, more detailed structural information on
PLY in physiological conditions is necessary not only to understand
the pore formation mechanism in human body but also to develop better
strategy for drugs and vaccines against pneumococcal infections.

In this study, we investigated three-dimensional (3D) structures
of PLY and its domains (D1–3 and D4)
in buffer solutions by synchrotron X-ray scattering. It was found
that PLY is present in phosphate buffered saline (PBS; pH = 7.4) as
a monomer and its 3D structure is similar to the crystal structure,
in spite of showing a certain level of mismatch. D4 was
also confirmed to be present in solution as a monomer. Its 3D structure
was very far from that of the corresponding part in the PLY crystalline
structure; the structure seems to be composed of a less folded chain.
In contrast, D1–3 tended to form a dimmer rather
than a monomer. The structure of D1–3 in the dimeric
state revealed to be comparable to that of the most possible dimer
constructed from the corresponding domain parts in the PLY crystal
structure. PLY and its domains revealed an aggregation tendency in
solutions. Such aggregation tendencies may directly relate to the
favorable formation of a large size ring structure of PLY oligomers
penetrating cell membranes. The ring structure formation may be further
significantly promoted by favorable interactions of the D4 unit with cholesterol molecules in the cell membranes.

f Standard deviation.

The scattering data were further
analyzed using the indirect Fourier
transformation (IFT) method.22,23 The analysis results
are shown in Figure 3 and Table 1. From
the pair distance distribution function p(r) profile obtained by IFT analysis, the radius of gyration Rg,p(r) is
determined to be 3.48 nm, which is slightly larger than the Rg,G value; this fact indicates that the Rg,G value was slightly underestimated. The 2Rg,G value is much smaller than the maximum diameter Dmax (12.00 nm), suggesting that PLY has a 3D
structure in PBS which is very far from an ideal spherical shape.
This deviation is also confirmed in the p(r) profile, which is very different from the symmetric bell-shaped p(r) profile of an ideal sphere (Figure 3b). From the p(r) profile, the radial electron density
distribution function ρ(r) was obtained. As
shown in Figure 3c,
the density reveals a maximum at the center of the structure and then
turns to decrease gradually, reaching to a minimum around r = 3 nm (here, r is the distance between
the paired scattering elements in PLY); thereafter, the density further
varies in an oscillating mode. This density profile characteristics
again indicate that the 3D structure of PLY in PBS is far from an
ideal spherical shape.

(b) pair distance distribution function p(r) profiles obtained by the data analysis; (c) electron
density distribution function ρ(r) profiles
obtained by the data analysis, which were normalized to the maximum
density.

From the scattering profile, the
molecular mass (Mm) of PLY was determined.
As shown in Figure 4, the scattering profile, which
was measured at a given concentration (3.3 mg/mL), was extrapolated
to q = 0, giving the scattering intensity I(q = 0); here, q is the
magnitude of the scattering vector defined by q =
(4π/λ)sin θ, where 2θ is the scattering
angle and λ is the wavelength of the X-ray beam. In the same
manner, I(q = 0) was obtained for
the BSA standard at a known concentration (2.0 mg/mL). From the extracted I(q = 0) values and the known concentrations,
the PLY in PBS was determined to have Mm = 52 900 Da with respect to the molecular weight (Mw,SBA = 66 430 Da) of the bovine serum
albumin (BSA) standard (Table 1), according to a method described in the literature.24 Since all the recombinant PLY, D1–3, and D4 proteins contain the two remnant amino acids,
glycine (75.07 Da), and proline (115.13 Da), the measured Mm value is very close to the molecular weight
(52 899 + 190) of PLY calculated from its amino acid sequences.
Indeed, this analysis proves that PLY is present in PBS solution as
a monomeric form.

obtained from the X-ray scattering data measured in PBS at 25 °C
by using the scattering of water standard. The symbols are the experimental
data, and the solid lines are the fits obtained from the data analysis
using the IFT method. The concentration used was 3.3 mg/mL for PLY,
4.4 mg/mL for D1–3, 2.1 mg/mL for D4,
and 2.0 mg/mL for the BSA standard.

From the X-ray scattering data, the 3D structure of PLY was
reconstructed
by the ab initio shape-determination analysis using the DAMMIF and
GASBOR programs.25,26 Structural analysis was proceeded
inside the search volume of Dmax calculated
from the p(r) profile. Successive
runs of GASBOR on the same data set, starting from the same initial
configuration of dummy residues, provided different models for analysis
and improvement in the reliability of the final structural solution.
When five independent models were generated and compared, the most
probable one was selected using the program DAMAVER27 to align all the other models, average the aligned models,
compute probability map, and filter the averaged model at a given
cut-off volume. The obtained 3D structure of PLY in PBS is displayed
in Figure 5a; here,
surface rendering of the envelope structure was done by using the
program Discovery Studio 2.0 (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA). The 3D
envelope structure was found to be superimposed well with the crystallographic
structure (Figure 5a); the superposition of the envelope structure to the crystallographic
structure was carried out by using the program SUPCOMB.28

measured X-ray scattering data in Figure 1: (a) the structure of PLY in PBS was superimposed

with the ribbon diagram for the most possible dimmer of the corresponding
unit in the crystallographic PLY structure; (c) the structure of D4 in PBS was superimposed with the ribbon diagram for the corresponding

The X-ray scattering data were further compared with those
calculated
from the atomic coordinates of the crystallographic PLY structure
(PDB code 4ZGH) using the program CRYSOL.29 As shown
in Figure 6a, the scattering
profile of the solution PLY structure is reasonably well matched with
that of the crystallographic structure over q ≤
0.023 nm–1; they show only 6.3% deviation (=σ)
over the considered q range. A reasonably good agreement
was confirmed in the pair distribution function profiles (Figure 6b) as well as in
the density profiles (Figure 6c).

Figure 6 PLY: (a) the X-ray scattering profile (which was obtained by fitting
the measured scattering data in Figure 1a using the IFT analysis program (GIFT or GNOM)) is
compared with that calculated from the atomic coordinates of the crystallographic
PLY structure using the program CRYSOL; (b) the comparison of the
pair distance distribution function p(r) profiles obtained from the measured and calculated X-ray scattering
data by the IFT analysis; (c) the comparison of the normalized electron
density distribution function ρ(r) profiles

scattering data.

The above X-ray scattering
analysis results and their comparisons
with the crystallographic structure collectively provide important
structural information in the following.

First, PLY reveals
a tendency to form a 3D structure as a monomer
in PBS. The 3D structure retains in a crystalline state and even in
solution. Such structural sustainability indicates that such a 3D
structure is quite stable. Due to the structural stability, PLY seems
to favorably have structural behavior like a rigid body.

Second,
such structural stability and rigidity of PLY may directly
relate to its aggregations in buffer solutions. In this study, we
have sometimes faced problems with aggregation of PLY during the purification
process and even in storage with changing temperature and time. Its
aggregation might take place in a manner far from a single crystal
formation in a reasonably large size which is commonly required for
crystallographic analysis. This situation seemed to cause great difficulties
in the structural identification of PLY by X-ray crystallography for
a long time. Nevertheless, its crystallographic analysis has recently
succeeded due to the continuous research efforts.16,17

Finally, the structurally stable and rigid characteristics
of PLY
might further relate to its large ring structure formation in cell
membranes via the cholesterol-mediated oligomerization reported in
the literature.11,16,18 The structurally stable and rigid characteristics may favorably
make great contribution to such large ring structure formation via
their interaction between the D4 unit and cholesterol units
in cell membranes.

Structural Characteristics of D1–3 in Solution
A representative of the X-ray scattering data
of D1–3 in PBS is shown in Figure 1b. The analysis results are shown in Figures 2b, 3, 4 and Table 1. The detailed analysis revealed that D1–3 in PBS
solution gives radius of gyration Rg,G = 4.51 nm, Rg,p(r) = 4.62 nm, and Dmax = 14.80 nm.
The 2Rg values are much smaller than the Dmax value. Surprisingly, the p(r) profile exhibits two broad peaks, which is quite
different in shape from those of the proteins in spherical or globular
shapes. Moreover, all the structural parameters are relatively larger
than those of PLY, although the number of its amino acid residues
is lower than that of PLY. The p(r) profile is also quite different from that of PLY. The ρ(r) profile, which was obtained from the p(r) profile, shows a maximum at the center of the
structure and then decreases, reaching a minimum around r = 4.7 nm. Thereafter, the ρ(r) continues
to vary with r in an oscillating mode. Apparently,
the r-dependent variation of the ρ(r) resembles that of PLY. However, the ρ(r) varies in a relatively larger r-scale. Overall,
these X-ray scattering characteristics collectively confirm that D1–3 in PBS solution reveals a 3D structure far from
the globular or spherical shape as well as from that of PLY in PBS
and, furthermore, relatively much larger in size than that of PLY
even though it is composed of less amino acids than PLY.

The
molecular mass of D1–3 was determined from the scattering
profile (Figure 4).
D1–3 was found to have Mm = 71 800 Da. This value is larger than that of PLY and further
close to twice the molecular weight of D1–3 calculated
from its amino acid residues. Together with the scattering characteristics
and structural parameters, the Mw value
suggests that D1–3 is present in PBS solution as
a dimeric form rather than a monomer.

From the X-ray scattering
data, the 3D structure of D1–3 was attempted to
reconstruct by ab initio shape-determination analysis.
The obtained 3D envelope structure was further attempted to superimpose
with a possible dimeric form (Figure 7) of the D1–3 structural unit separated
from the crystallographic PLY. As shown in Figure 5b, the 3D structure of D1–3 in PBS is reasonably superimposed with the dimeric form of the corresponding
unit in the crystallographic PLY structure, but still shows a certain
level of mismatch.

Figure 7 Most possible dimeric structure of D1–3 in PBS;
here, the ribbon diagram of a single D1–3 was extracted
from the crystallographic PLY structure.

To find the degree of such mismatch, an X-ray scattering
profile
was calculated from the atomic coordinates of the crystallographic
D1–3 unit in a most probable dimeric form (Figure 7) and then compared
with the experimentally measured scattering profile. The mismatch
was found to be σ = 13.1% over the range of q ≤ 0.025 nm–1 (Figure 8a). A certain level of structural difference
was further confirmed in the p(r) profiles as well as in the ρ(r) profiles
(Figure 8b,c).

Figure 8 D1–3: (a) the X-ray scattering profile (which
was obtained by fitting the measured scattering data in Figure 1b using an IFT analysis program
(GIFT or GNOM)) is compared with that calculated from the atomic coordinates
for the most possible dimer (Figure 7) of the corresponding part in the crystallographic
PLY structure using the program CRYSOL. (b) The comparison of the
pair distance distribution function p(r) profiles obtained from the measured and calculated X-ray scattering
data by the IFT analysis. (c) The comparison of the normalized electron
density distribution function ρ(r) profiles

scattering data.

X-ray scattering analysis
results collectively provide some key
structural information on D1–3 in PBS solution as
follows. D1–3 prefers to be present in PBS as a
dimeric form rather than a monomer. This dimer formation characteristic
may relate closely to an aggregation tendency of PLY often observed
in several buffer solutions used during purification and storage.
The 3D structure of D1–3 in PBS is apparently similar
to the most probable dimeric structure of the corresponding domain
unit of the crystallographic PLY structure, although a certain extent
of mismatch is found. These results confirm that the individual D1–3 units of the dimeric form in PBS are almost identical
to the structure of the corresponding part of PLY in the crystallographic
state. This fact confirms that the D1–3 unit is
structurally stable and, therefore, can retain its structure in PBS
in addition to the crystalline state. Such structural stability of
the D1–3 unit can contribute greatly to the overall
structural stability of PLY.

Structural Characteristics of D4 in Solution
A representative of the X-ray scattering data
of D4 in
PBS is shown in Figure 1c. The scattering profile was quite different from those of PLY and
D1–3. The analysis results are illustrated in Figures 2c, 3, 4 and Table 1. D4 reveals Rg,G = 1.48 nm, Rg,p(r) = 1.74 nm, and Dmax = 7.00 nm. The Rg,G value is
slightly smaller than Rg,p(r). These structural parameters are much smaller than
those of PLY and D1–3. The p(r) profile is also very far in shape from those of PLY and
D1–3. Moreover, the Dmax value is almost 2 times larger than 2Rg. The ρ(r) profile shows variations with r, which is similar to those observed for PLY and D1–3; however, such variations took place in a much shorter
length scale, when compared to those of PLY and D1–3. Its molecular mass is only 13 900 Da, which is in good agreement
with the molecular weight calculated from the amino acid residues.
These results collectively show that the structure of D4 is relatively much smaller due to its low molecular weight and the
structure is very much different from globular or spherical shape.

Figure 5c shows
a 3D structure of D4 in PBS, which was reconstructed by
the ab initio shape-determination analysis of the X-ray scattering
data. We attempted to superimpose the obtained 3D structure with that
of the D4 unit in the crystallographic PLY structure. However,
it was found that the structure of D4 in PBS solution significantly
mismatched with that of the corresponding crystallographic domain.
Such severe mismatch is due to its chain conformation far from the
more folded conformation in the crystallographic PLY structure.

The structural difference is again confirmed in the X-ray scattering
profiles; here, the scattering data of the D4 unit in the
crystalline state were calculated from its atomic coordinates in the
crystallographic PLY structure. The X-ray scattering profile of D4 in the solution is highly mismatched with that of the corresponding
domain in the PLY crystal, as shown in Figure 9a. The mismatch is 92.0% (=σ) over
the measured q range. The large mismatch is further
found in the p(r) profiles as well
as in the ρ(r) profiles (Figure 9b,c).

Figure 9 D4: (a) the X-ray scattering
profile (which was obtained
by fitting the measured scattering data in Figure 1c using the IFT analysis program (GIFT or
GNOM)) is compared with that calculated from the atomic coordinates
of the corresponding unit in the crystallographic PLY structure using
the program CRYSOL. (b) The comparison of the pair distance distribution
function p(r) profiles obtained
from the measured and calculated X-ray scattering data by the IFT
analysis. (c) The comparison of the normalized electron density distribution
function ρ(r) profiles obtained from the IFT
analyses of the measured and calculated X-ray scattering data.

Overall, these analysis results
provide the following key structural
features.

First, D4 tends to form a 3D structure
as a monomer.
The 3D structure is quite different from that of the corresponding
unit in the crystallographic PLY structure.

Second, D4 exhibits a less folded structure in PBS.
Such a structure seems to favor under the conditions without the assistance
or cooperation of the D1–3 unit; namely, the presence
and cooperation of the D1–3 unit may be necessary
to a more folded structure formation of the D4 unit in
both solution and crystalline states.

Finally, D4 in PBS solution has often exhibited serious
aggregation behavior in spite of its monomeric structure formation
with a less folded or completely unfolded chain characteristics. This
result indicates that D4 has a certain level of tendency
to aggregate with the less folded or completely unfolded chain characteristics
in the monomeric form. Such aggregation tendency of D4 may
inherently contribute to the aggregation in solution and the large
ring structure formation on the cell membrane surface of PLY. The
ring structure formation of PLY could be significantly promoted by
the constructive interaction of the D4 unit with the cholesterol
molecules at the cell membrane.

Conclusions
PLY,
a cytolytic toxin of S. pneumoniae,
and its truncated fragments (D1–3 and D4) were purified as recombinant proteins after being cloned and over-expressed
in Escherichia coli. PLY and its domains
were investigated from the view of 3D structures in PBS, a biomimetic
condition, by synchrotron X-ray scattering. The quantitative X-ray
scattering analysis produced structural parameters and features for
PLY and its domains in PBS. The important structural features were
found as follows.

First, PLY and D4 are monomeric
respectively, whereas
D1–3 is dimeric.

Second, PLY reveals a structure,
which resembles the crystallographic
structure; the structural mismatch is only 6.3%. These results confirm
that the monomeric PLY is structurally stable and rigid and, consequently,
retains its own structure in both solution and crystalline states.

Third, D4 reveals a structure far from that of the corresponding
part in the crystallographic PLY structure; the structural mismatch
is huge, 92.0%. Such huge structural mismatch suggests that D4 exhibits a less folded-chain conformation rather than a folded-chain
conformation observed in the crystallographic PLY structure.

Fourth, the dimeric D1–3 exhibits a 3D structure
resembling the most probable dimeric form of the corresponding part
in the crystallographic PLY structure; the structural mismatch is
13.1%. The results show that the D1–3 unit is structurally
stable and further retains its structure well in the buffer solution
in addition to the crystalline state. Such structural stability of
the D1–3 unit can contribute greatly to the overall
structural stability of PLY.

Finally, in buffer solution PLY
and D1–3 were
found to sometimes aggregate, whereas D4 was often aggregated.
Such aggregation behaviors may directly relate to the favorable formation
of a large size ring structure of PLY on cell membranes. The ring
structure formation may be further significantly promoted by favorable
interactions of the D4 unit with the hydroxyl group of
cholesterol at the cell membrane surface.

Materials and Methods
Expression
and Purification of Recombinant PLY and Its Domains
DNA fragments
encoding PLY and its domains were cloned from S. pneumoniae D39 strain by the polymerase chain
reaction into an expression vector pGEX-6P-2. The recombinant PLY
(471 amino acids), D1–3 (359 amino acids),30,31 and D4 (112 amino acids)30,31 were expressed
as fusion proteins to glutathione-S-transferase (GST)
for affinity purification and then cleaved by a specific protease
leaving two extra amino acids (glycine and proline) at the N-termini
of PLY and its domains. To purify the recombinant proteins, E. coli BL21 (DE3) strain carrying the cloned PLY
or domains in the pGEX-6P-2 vector was grown on an OD600 of 0.6–0.8
and induced with 0.5 mM IPTG for 2 h at 30 °C with vigorous shaking.
Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in phosphate-based
bacterial protein extraction reagent (Cell Biolabs, San Diego, CA)
and lysed at room temperature. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation
at 10 000 × g for 30 min. For the affinity
purification of the recombinant PLY, D1–3, and D4, manufacturers’ instructions were followed. Briefly,
the total cell lysate was loaded onto a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column
(GE healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA) pre-equilibrated with PBS (pH = 7.4).
After washing the column with PBS and then with 50 mM Tris–HCl
(pH 8), GST fusion proteins were eluted using 10 mM reduced glutathione
(Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO) in 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8).
The eluted GST fusion proteins were specifically cleaved by PreScission
protease (GE healthcare) in cleavage buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl,
150 mM NaCl, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 1 mM dithiothreitol,
pH 7.0) at 4 °C overnight. PLY, D1–3, and D4 were further purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose
4B column to remove the GST tag and PreScission enzyme, and then concentrated
using Amicon ultracentrifugal filters (Merck Millipore, Billerica,
MA) to final concentrations of 2–5 mg/mL in PBS: 3.3 mg/mL
for PLY, 4.4 mg/mL for D1–3, and 2.1 mg/mL for D4. SDS-PAGE was performed to follow each purification step
and to check the purity of the prepared proteins.

Synchrotron
X-ray Scattering Measurement and Data Analysis
Synchrotron
X-ray scattering measurements were carried out at the
4C SAXS beamline (BL)32−36 of the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL) at the Pohang University
of Science and Technology, Korea. The monochromatized X-ray beam with
a wavelength λ of 0.6753 Å was employed and a two-dimensional
(2D) charge-coupled detector (model Rayonix 2D MAR, Evanston, IL)
was used. The sample-to-detector distances were 3931.8 and 1039.0
mm. Scattering angles were calibrated by using a silver behenate standard
(TCI, Tokyo, Japan) and a pre-calibrated polystyrene-block-poly(ethylene-ran-butylene)-block-polystyrene standard. Each protein solution was filtered through
a disposable syringe equipped with a poly(tetrafluoroethylene) filter
of 0.2 μm pore size before measurements; in most of the PLY
and D1–3 solutions, filtrations were not necessary.
Scattering data were collected at 25 °C for 10 s.

Each
2D scattering pattern was circularly averaged from the beam center,
normalized to the transmitted X-ray beam intensity (monitored with
a scintillation counter placed behind the sample), and further corrected
for scattering arising from the PBS solution used. The obtained X-ray
scattering data were initially analyzed by using the Guinier’s
law,21 giving radius of gyration (Rg,G). Then, the X-ray scattering data were analyzed
using the IFT method,22,23 providing pair distance distribution
function p(r) profiles; in these
analyses, the GIFT program22 or the GNOM
program23 was used. p(r) can be expressed as follows 1  where, I(q) is the scattered X-ray intensity, q is the magnitude
of the scattering vector defined by q = (4π/λ)sin θ,
2θ is the scattering angle, λ is the wavelength of the
X-ray beam, and r is the distance between the paired
scattering elements in PLY or its domains. From the p(r) profile, the radius of gyration Rg,p(r) and maximum diameter Dmax of the given biomacromolecule can be extracted;
here, Rg,p(r) can be expressed by the following equation 2  From the p(r) profile, the radial electron density distribution function
ρ(r) was additionally extracted by using the
DECON program.22

The X-ray scattering
data were further analyzed to determine the
molecular mass Mm of each protein. From
the X-ray scattering profile, Mm can be
obtained using the following relation24 3  where c is the concentration
of protein, Mw,BSA is the molecular weight
of bovine serum albumin (BSA) standard (Mw,SBA = 66 430 Da; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), and cBSA is the concentration of BSA standard. Here, it is
assumed that the proteins of this study have partial specific volumes
same as or close to that of BSA because most of the proteins are known
to have very similar partial specific volumes; proteins reveal an
averaged partial specific volume ν̅ of
0.7425 cm3/g.24Ia(q = 0) and Ia,BSA(q = 0) are the absolute intensities of protein
and BSA standard at q = 0, respectively. Ia(q = 0) was obtained by extrapolating
the scattering profile of protein to q = 0 using
the GIFT program22 or GNOM program.23 In the same manner, Ia,BSA(q = 0) was obtained from the scattering profile
of BSA standard. The scattering intensity profiles in the absolute
scale were obtained from the measured scattering data using the absolute
scattering intensity of water (Ia,water(q = 0) = 1.632 × 10–2 cm–1 at 25 °C24,37) 4  and 5  where, Iwater(q = 0) is the measured
scattering intensity of water at q = 0, which is
obtained by extrapolating the scattering
profile to q = 0, and I(q) and IBSA(q) are the measured scattering profiles of protein and BSA standard
respectively.

To obtain a 3D structure, the X-ray scattering
data were additionally
analyzed by using ab initio shape-determination programs (DAMMIF25 and GASBOR26). In
addition, the X-ray scattering profile of PLY in the crystalline state
was calculated from its atomic coordinates obtained from the Protein
Data Bank (PDB code: 4ZGH).16,17
