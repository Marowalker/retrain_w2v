A copolymer comprising
of pyrrole and 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl
ether (PBDGE) was designed and synthesized as a leveler to improve
the throwing power for printed circuit board (PCB) through-hole electroplating.
The results of linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), galvanostatic measurements
(GMs), and cyclic voltammetry (CV) reveal the strong coordination
effect of PBDGE with other additives and confirm the advantageous
performance of PBDGE to effectively assist the electroplating of through-hole.
An increment of 35.5% in the throwing power was achieved under the
addition of PBDGE in through-hole plating. Additionally, the reaction
mechanism was studied by quantum chemical calculations and molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations, indicating that the pyrrole rings of the
PBDGE molecule are adsorbed on the copper surface as the adsorption
sites to balance the copper plating regardless of the through-hole
position differences.

Introduction
Recently, printed circuit boards (PCBs)
with high-density interconnection
(HDI) have received a lot of attention due to the wide application
in 5G communication, wearable devices, and other booming fields.1−5 As is well known, the copper electrodeposition in acidic electrolytes
plays a critical role in PCB manufacture.6,7 The
copper electroplating of the through-holes (THs) is especially performed
to obtain the conductive interconnection between the layers in multilayer
PCB. The growing complexity of electronic products promotes the development
of HDI technology and puts forward higher quality requirements for
the copper coating of TH.6−11 Nevertheless, there are still several challenges to meet the electronic
product trend of miniaturization, integration, and portability.

To establish a reliable system performance, it is crucial to achieving
a highly reliable conductive coating with uniform thickness. As for
THs, the uniform coating thickness of TH means that the thickness
of the center (low current density) is close to the one at the mouth
(high current density). However, there are two major issues affecting
the uniformity of TH metallization, which are inhomogeneous current
distribution and the different transfer rates of metal ions and additives.8 Accordingly, particular organic additives were
developed to meet the requirement of the stepless coating thickness
in different current density regions of the TH.9,10,12−17

Generally, organic additives are classified as an accelerator,
such as bis-(sodium sulfopropyl)-disulfide (SPS), inhibitor, including
poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), and leveler, such as Janus Green B (JGB).10,12 The effect of additives in the electroplating bath is not a simple
superposition of the effects of each single component additive but
a result of complex synergistic or anticompetitive effects among them.
The synergistic effect among additives mostly originates from their
adsorption and migration characteristics under chloride ions and the
competition between the suppressor, accelerator, and leveler.13−16 It is generally believed that Cl– can act as a
synergistic inhibitor to hinder the copper electrodeposition.6,7,13,14 There is a strong interaction between the accelerator and the metal
surface. In the presence of Cl–, the accelerator
has a strong adsorption effect on the copper surface.18,19 It has been confirmed that SPS–Cl– is an
accelerator for copper electrodeposition.13−16 Zhu et al.20 found that SPS adsorption on copper surface is not related
to the convection and ethylene oxide/propylene oxide (EO/PO) is proportional
to convective intensity. With the increase of convective intensity,
there is a competitive relationship between EO/PO and SPS adsorption.
Dow et al.21 documented the synergistic
effect of PEG–SPS–diazine black (DB)–Cl– and found DB and PEG–Cl– have no synergistic
effect on the inhibition of copper electrodeposition, whereas JGB
is capable of doing that. In the presence of PEG, DB can still significantly
inhibit the promotion effect of SPS in copper electrodeposition with
the existence of chloride ions.

In several recent studies, the
importance of leveler has been highlighted.22−25 The leveler increases the polarization
of the electrode to inhibit
the electrodeposition of copper, resulting in a uniform copper coating.
Usually, the levelers involved in copper electrodeposition are nitrogen-containing
or quaternary ammonium compounds including dye molecules (e.g., JGB),26 quaternary ammonium surfactants,27 and copolymers.28 The dye molecules, however, are unstable in the electroplating bath
because of the spontaneous decomposition.29 Recently, quaternary ammonium surfactants have attracted a lot of
interest.7,22,27 It was found
that pyrrole derivatives tend to adsorb to the cathode in electroplating
because of the electrophilic aryl ring of pyrrole, which is supported
by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and quantum chemical calculations.30

Throwing power (TP) is an important index
to evaluate the leveling
ability of levelers.7 The results of through-hole
plating are characterized by cross-sectional images of the THs obtained
by a metalloscope (Olympus BX51). Generally, the value of TP is calculated
by the six-point method expressed by eq 1 1  where ha, hb, hc, and hd are the electroplating thicknesses at the
surface of the TH; he and hf are the electroplating thicknesses at the center of
the TH, respectively, as shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Diagram of the through-hole displaying the positions
of measured
points for TP calculation.

In this paper, the synthesis of a new leveler based on pyrrole
and 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether (BDGE) was attempted. The effects
of PBDGE on electrochemical processes and the coordination effect
with other additives during electrodeposition were investigated through
electrochemical experiments. The electroplating results prove that
PBDGE can make the copper coating in TH more uniform under certain
electroplating conditions.

Results and Discussion
The polymerization
process of pyrrole and BDGE is shown in Figure 2. Glycidyl ether
ring-opening reaction takes place under alkaline conditions31 and then undergoes polymerization with pyrrole.
During polymerization, glycidyl ether polymerizes with pyrrole; then,
the self-polymerization reaction occurs as well. Because the chain
grows through a similar reaction for both pyrrole and BDGE, a random
copolymer comprising pyrrole and BDGE is formed.

Figure 2 Synthetic reaction of
copolymers of pyrrole and 1,4-butanediol
diglycidyl ether.

The structure of this
copolymer was investigated through Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Figure 3 illustrates the FTIR spectra of pyrrole
(curve a), BDGE (curve b), and PBDGE (curve c) generated by 6 h of
reaction between pyrrole and BDGE. The epoxide characteristic peak
(912 cm–1) of the reactant BDGE completely disappears
in the spectrum of PBDGE, which means that BDGE undergoes a ring-opening
reaction.7 The characteristic peak enhancement
of the hydroxyl group at 3700–3200 cm–1 in
the PBDGE curve also supports the occurrence of an open-loop reaction
in the epoxy group.32 In addition, there
is a characteristic peak of the copolymer product at 1356 cm–1 implying the formation of C–N, which is absent in the spectra
pyrrole (curve a) and BDGE (curve b).33

The influences of PBDGE on the potential
dynamic polarization behavior
in the case of copper electrodeposition in the base electrolyte are
shown in Figure 4a.
In electrochemical experiments, the transfer rates of reactants at
the center and mouth of the TH are simulated by different rotation
speeds of the working electrode (WE).10 The low (100 rpm) and high (1500 rpm) rotation speeds correspond
to the center and mouth of the TH, respectively. As detailed in Figure 4a, the polarization
of the samples with strong convection is more intense than the ones
with weak convection because the forced convection dominates the transfer
of reactants in the cathode electrochemical reaction with the absence
of PBDGE.34 PBDGE caused polarization in
the electrolyte because the cathode potential dropped immediately
when 20 mg L–1 PBDGE was introduced. Moreover, the
high rotation speed displays a significantly stronger electrode working
polarization than the one at the low rotation speed. In other words,
PBDGE is able to enhance the inhibition of copper deposition at a
higher rotation speed, which implies that the copper deposition rate
at TH center is higher than the one at the TH mouth.

(OCP) of the copper preplated film on the Pt electrode. (I) Virgin
make-up solution (VMS) at 100 rpm; (II) VMS at 1500 rpm; (III) VMS
+ 20 mg L–1 PBDGE at 100 rpm; and (IV) VMS + 20
mg L–1 PBDGE at 1500 rpm. (b) Galvanostatic measurements
(GMs) of plating solutions at the current density of 2 A dm–2 at 1500 and 100 rpm. A 20 mg L–1 PBDGE was injected
into the bath at 1800 s.

The influence of PBDGE
on TH plating was studied at low rotation
speeds (100 rpm) and high rotation speeds (1500 rpm) at 2 A dm–2 with the GMs, as illustrated in Figure 4b. The potential difference
at different rotating speeds Δη, defined by Δη
= η100rpm – η1500rpm is used
to evaluate the inhibitive performance of copper deposition.12 With the addition of 500 mg L–1 PEG-10 000 at 300 s, the cathodic potentials dropped rapidly.
This drop is due to the electrode polarization by PEG. A difference
in the potential decrement (Δη1) is observed
between the two tested groups. In the presence of PEG, 1 mg L–1 SPS weakened the polarization and the Δη
value changed from negative to positive (Δη2 = +11.6 mV). This trend continued until the next addition of PBDGE
in the plating solution, which confirms that the acidic electrolytes
are brightener (SPS)-dominated system. The cathode polarization was
enhanced when 20 mg L–1 PBDGE was added at 1800
s. As displayed in Figure 4b, the value of Δη3 is higher than
that of Δη2. This result represents that the
high transfer rate suppresses the copper electrodeposition at the
mouth of TH.12,21 In summary, the adsorption of
PBDGE on the cathode is positively correlated with the convective
intensity; meanwhile, stronger convection leads to greater overpotential.
When PEG and Cl– are both in the bath, the copolymer
PBDGE interestingly inhibits the SPS accelerating activity for copper
electrodeposition.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests were performed
to investigate the
interactive behavior of the additives in copper deposition (Figure 5). The amount of
electrodeposited copper on the cathode under different conditions
is listed in Table 2. As illustrated in Figure 5a, the addition of PBDGE in the plating bath caused the copper
stripping peak to become smaller, indicating that PBDGE enhances cathodic
polarization. The addition of Cl– at the existence
of PBDGE led to a more negative shift of deposition potentials than
in the case of PBDGE alone. The corresponding results are also found
in the high convection condition (Figure 5b). Therefore, the CV tests prove that Cl– can be in conjunction with PBDGE to inhibit copper
electrodeposition. This synergistic effect is effective both at weak
and strong convection conditions.

Figure 5 Cyclic voltammetry tests conducted at
100 rpm (a) and 1500 rpm
(b) in different electrolytes.

Peak in the CV Tests

The CV results in Figure 5 reveal that PBDGE can inhibit copper electrodeposition
without
Cl– in the plating bath. The amount of electrodeposited
copper at 1500 rpm is less than that at 100 rpm, which indicates that
strong convection is beneficial to the inhibition of copper electrodeposition
by PBDGE. These facts are in accordance with the results of linear
sweep voltammetry (LSV) and GMs discussed above. When PEG was added
into the electrolyte, the inhibitory effect of PBDGE was obviously
weakened (Figure 5b),
which indicates the competitive absorption between PEG and PBDGE.
As shown in Figure 5, the addition of SPS in the presence of other additives can increase
the amount of copper electrodeposition, indicating that SPS has the
effect of depolarization in the cathode.

As listed in Table 2, with the addition
of PBDGE, the amount of electroplated copper
at 100 rpm is more than that at 1500 rpm. This trend is inverted in
the case of VMS. With the addition of SPS, a greater increase in the
amount of electrodeposited copper occurred at 100 rpm, indicating
that the depolarization effect of SPS is stronger under weak convection.
This result illustrates that the additive system of PEG + Cl– + SPS + PBDGE + Cl– can effectively inhibit the
copper electrodeposition at the mouth and causes the copper thickness
to increase at the center of TH.

The compositions of electroplating
baths with and without leveler
are shown in Table 3. The corresponding TH cross sections are illustrated in Figure 6. The TP value is
54.5% when the leveler is absent, and the TP value can increase to
72.4% with JGB (Figure 6b). Notably, the TP value can be further increased to 90% with the
addition of PBDGE. The copper thickness of the TH center increased
from 15 to 24 μm (Figure 6c). The TH electroplating experiments show that PBDGE has
a strong inhibition of copper electrodeposition on the TH mouth. As
a result, the current density distribution on the whole hole surface
is effectively improved because of the inclusion of PBDGE.23,35

According to the frontier molecular
orbital theory, the highest
occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital (LUMO) are the keys to determine the chemical reactivity of
a system.36 The simulated HOMO and LUMO
of PBDGE are given in Figure 7. Generally, EHOMO is related
to the electron-donating ability and ELUMO is closely interrelated to the ability of molecules to accept electrons.37,38 The energy gap (ΔE) should be calculated
by ΔE = ELUMO – EHOMO. The adsorption capacity of organic molecules
on the metal surface increases with the decreasing ELUMO or increasing EHOMO.39,40 Generally, ΔE is relevant to the chemical
stability of the leveler and could be used to evaluate the adsorption
ability. As shown in Figure 7, EHOMO of PBDGE is −6.070
eV, which is near EHOMO of JGB (−5.689
eV).18ELUMO of PBDGE is −0.114 eV, which is much less than ELUMO of JGB (−3.635 eV).18 These calculated energy levels support the fact that PBDGE is an
effective leveler. It is also observed in Figure 7 that the LUMO and HOMO of PBDGE molecules
are mainly concentrated on the pyrrole ring of PBDGE, which implies
that the pyrrole ring of PBDGE is in the active position of adsorption
with the copper surface.

Molecular dynamics simulations
were used to analyze the adsorption
behaviors of PBDGE at the Cu(111) crystal surface.41Figure 8 shows that the pyrrole rings of PBDGE are adsorbed on the copper
surface in the final equilibrium configuration. The calculated value
of Ebinding of PBDGE is −150.662
KJ/mol, which is larger than that of Ebinding of JGB.18 A high Ebinding indicates the strong adsorption capacity between PBDGE
and copper surface.42,43 The electrostatic effect between
PBDGE and copper surface governs the competitive adsorption of additives.
PBDGE’s adsorption results in a reduction in the area of copper
exposed from the cathode, which affects the copper electrodeposition.
This simulation supports the fact that PBDGE as a discovered leveler
is as effective as the common leveler JGB.23

Conclusions
In
this article, a leveler, PBDGE, employed for TH electroplating
was synthesized and analyzed. An excellent TH plating sample with
the TP value of 90% with the increased copper thickness at the center
of TH was obtained. The optimized copper plating formula is composed
of 60 mg L–1 Cl–, 500 mg L–1 PEG, 1 mg L–1 SPS, and 20 mg L–1 PBDGE.

The addition of PBDGE increases the
cathodic polarization and inhibits
the copper electrodeposition. The inhibitory effect of PBDGE on the
copper mouth is stronger with the existence of all the additives,
which is beneficial to obtain the uniform coating in electroplating.
On the other hand, it is found that Cl– has a synergistic
effect with PBDGE, which can enhance the inhibition of PBDGE. This
is of vital importance to the through-hole interconnection of PCB
for electronic information products that are being developed for the
purpose of miniaturization, integration, and portability. Simulation
results show that the pyrrole ring on PBDGE is the active position
of copper surface adsorption. Additionally, the simulation shows that
PBDGE has a strong adsorption tendency on the copper surface, which
can reduce the surface area of exposed copper and inhibit copper electrodeposition.

Methods
The PBDGE copolymer was synthesized on the basis of the amine glycidyl
reaction using pyrrole (99.7%, Shanghai Aladdin Co., Ltd.) and 1,4-butanediol
diglycidyl ether (60%, Shanghai Aladdin Co., Ltd.) as reactants. Pyrrole
(5 mol L–1) and BDGE (5 mol L–1) were added into 1 mol L–1 KOH in a round-bottom
flask under nitrogen protection. This mixture was stirred at 300 rpm
for 6 h and 338 K. After the reaction, the solvent in the mixture
was removed by rotary evaporation and dried under vacuum at 10–2 mbar. Moreover, this product can be pure PBDGE by
removing the unreacted reactants by washing with tetrahydrofuran solution
several times, and then evaporating the residual tetrahydrogen peroxide
by rotary evaporation.

Electrochemical behaviors of PBDGE were
characterized by linear
sweep voltammetry (LSV), galvanostatic measurements (GMs), and cyclic
voltammetry (CV) tests using platinum rotating disk electrode (Pt-RDE)
operated at 100 and 1500 rpm. All of the electrochemical experiments
were conducted in a 250 mL glass beaker including 200 mL of electroplating
solution by an Autolab (PGSTAT302N, Metrohm) electrochemical workstation
with a conventional three-electrode system. The electroplating solution
temperature was kept at 298 K during electrochemical experiments.
The working electrode (WE) was a platinum rotating disk electrode
(Pt-RDE) with a diameter of 5 mm. The counter electrode (CE) was a
copper rod and the reference electrode (RE) was a saturated mercury
sulfate electrode (SSE). The LSV polarization plots were recorded
with a negative-going sweep from an open-circuit potential to −0.9
V vs SSE. The current density of GMs was set up at 2 A dm–2 at 100 and 1500 rpm. The electrode scanning potentials of CV tests
were measured to be from −0.685 to 1.2 V.

Printed circuit
boards with several rows of through-holes are used
to make test boards, and the diameter and height of these THs are
0.25 and 1.6 mm, respectively. These test boards deposited conductive
copper by electroless copper before electroplating. The anode used
for electroplating is a phosphorus copper anode. The test boards were
plated at a current density of 2 A dm–2 for 70 min
in 1.5 L Haring cell at 298 K. Air bubble agitation continuously flowed
out from the bottom of the Haring cell at a flow rate of 2.5 L min–1 to provide sufficient convection. Virgin make-up
solution (VMS) consisted of 75 g L–1 CuSO4·5H2O and 240 g L–1 98% H2SO4. SPS was used as the accelerator, PEG (MW = 10 000) was the inhibitor, while PBDGE was
added as the leveler.

Quantum chemical calculations were performed
by Gaussian 09. Geometry
optimizations were carried out by density functional theory (DFT)
using B3LYP functional with the 6-311G+(d.p) basis set.44 The frontier molecular orbital energies and
energy gap of PBDGE were calculated and considered. These parameters
were used to further elaborate the mechanism of interaction between
PBDGE and copper surface.18

The adsorption
model between PBDGE and the Cu(111) surface was
studied by employing the forcite module in Material Studio software.
The MD simulations were performed under the constraints of 298 K,
NVT ensemble, and COMPASS force field.18,44 MD simulations
of the interaction between PBDGE and the copper crystal were performed
in a simulation box (3.10 × 3.10 × 5.99 nm3).
There is a copolymer PBDGE molecule, 500 water molecules, and seven
layers of copper atoms neatly arranged at the bottom.18 The interaction energy ECu–PDBGE between the copper atoms and PBDGE was calculated by eq 2. 2  Ecomplex is the
total energy of copper, PBDGE, and the interaction of copper and PBDGE; ECu and EPDBGE are
the energies of the copper crystal and free PBDGE, respectively. Also,
the negative value of the interaction energy is the binding energy.

The molecular structure of purified copolymer was characterized
by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The average molecular
weight was provided by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) tests.
FTIR tests were carried out in a Nicolet 6700 spectroscope (Thermo
Scientific) in transmission mode. The spectra were obtained at a wavelength
of 4000–500 cm–1. GPC measurements were performed
in Waters 2695 configured with an RI detector.
