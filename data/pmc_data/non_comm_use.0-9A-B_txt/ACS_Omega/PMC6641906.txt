Identification and
characterization of novel battery electrode
materials are key factors in transitioning the grids to renewable
energy provision. Given the scale of the challenge, special attention
should be paid to safety and availability of resources. This paper
presents a new electrode material for aqueous batteries and supercapacitors
based on highly available resources: chromium(II) hexacyanoferrate
(CrHCF) thin films. Electrodeposited CrHCF exhibited “half-charge”
potentials (E1/2) of ∼0.69 and
∼0.72 V versus silver/silver chloride (reference electrode)
for Na and K intercalation, respectively, a high specific capacity
of ∼88 mA h/g (10 C), and a good rate performance at fast C-rate
(360 C). The electrolyte composition significantly influences the
long-term cycling stability of the CrHCF electrodes and the choice
of the intercalating alkali metal cations significantly impacts the E1/2 potentials. Finally, a CrHCF-based symmetric
cell (quasi-supercapacitor) was constructed and showed high specific
energy of ∼4.6 W h/kg at 100 C.

Introduction
The changes in society’s perspective
on climate change and
sustainability have led to global compromises to reduce carbon-based
emissions, such as the Paris climate change agreement. In a bid to
cut carbon emission, various technologies have been developed for
electricity provision from renewable energy sources, as well as for
energy consumption, such as fuel cell cars and battery electric vehicles.
In research and development of energy technologies, batteries (often
combined with supercapacitors) are placed as the key candidates for
electricity storage to transfer energy from production to consumption.1,2 The expectation for the huge growth in the electric vehicle market
has opened explosive increase of investments on battery development
from both public and private institutions, leading to already successful
commercialization.3

However, the
development of appropriate electrochemical energy
storage systems (ESSs) for grid ESSs is still at an early stage because
of different requirements from mobile applications.4 For large-scale applications, safety and costs should be
considered to be equal to or even more important than energy density.
The global energy demand is predicted to increase to ca. 30 TWavg by 2050.5 To achieve sustainable
energy provision using new schemes, the availability and the abundance
of materials should be taken into consideration as one of the main
factors for upscaling. Figure 1 provides a visual comparison of the annual global production
of common elements for battery materials. It suggests that the direct
application of current Li-ion batteries onto grid-scale storage systems
might not be achievable within a reasonable time scale,5 despite their high energy density and well-developed
technology. The limited availability and increasing demand of Li will
further increase the price, which makes it more difficult to address
the “Terawatt Challenge” in time.6,7 Furthermore,
flammable organic electrolytes of Li-ion batteries largely increase
safety risks in large-scale applications.

The full circles represent the elements mainly used for electrode
materials and the half-black circles represent those for either electrodes
or electrolytes, partly adapted from ref (5).

Aqueous batteries using different alkali metal cations for
grid-scale
energy storage have drawn a considerable attention, thanks to safety
and the high rate capability of aqueous electrolytes compared to organic
electrolytes.8 Among various classes of
electrode materials for aqueous batteries, Prussian blue analogues
(PBAs) are particularly interesting owing to their superior cycle
life, low price, and abundant raw materials for building electrodes.9−11 PBAs have fcc structure based on the two transition metals that
are coordinated with sixfold carbon or nitrogen. The representative
chemical formula of PBAs can be written as XyTM1[TM2(CN)6] (where X represents
the intercalating cations, TM1 and TM2 are the
transition metals, and y is frequently 1 or 2). Many
different PBAs have been studied for aqueous and nonaqueous batteries
such as Na2Ni[Fe(CN)6] (NiHCF),12−14 Na1.54Co[Fe(CN)6]0.86·γ0.14·2.16H2O (CoHCF),15 K0.71Cu [Fe(CN)6]0.72·3.7H2O (CuHCF),16 Na2VOx[Fe(CN)6] (VHCF),17 and NaxMn[Mn(CN)6] (MnHCM).18,19 However, considering utilization
for large-scale applications and the availability of raw materials,
it would be ideal to use the most abundant and light TM1 and TM2, namely, Cr and Fe (see Figure 1).

Results and Discussion
Figure 2A shows
a typical cyclic voltammogram (CV) characterizing the electrochemical
deposition of chromium(II) hexacyanoferrate (CrHCF) thin films: the
increase in cathodic and anodic current peaks reveals the growth of
the film. Electrodeposition on graphene foam using a smaller potential
range, for example, from −0.7 to 1.1 V versus silver/silver
chloride (SSC), could not be achieved. Only when the lower potential
was extended to −1.1 V versus SSC, CrHCF electrodeposition
occurred. This is in good accordance with the claims of Gao and Jiang
et al.20,21 that reduction of Cr3+ (−0.95
V vs SSC)22 is a mandatory condition for
electrodeposition. Further insight into the CrHCF electrodeposition
mechanism is beyond the scope of this manuscript.

films. (B) Typical CVs of CrHCF thin film in aqueous 0.25 M KNO3 (blue curve) and 0.25 M NaNO3 (green curve) electrolytes.

CrHCF thin films. To improve the signal intensity, the CrHCF thin
film was electrodeposited onto a Pt/Ti quartz crystal substrate.

Representative CVs of CrHCF thin
films in aqueous 0.25 M NaNO3 (green curves) and 0.25 M
KNO3 (blue curves) electrolytes
characterizing intercalation and deintercalation of K+ are
depicted in Figure 2B. The cathodic and anodic peaks result from the change of the oxidation
state of Fe in CrHCF, which in turn induces the intercalation and
deintercalation of Na or K cations, respectively. Figure 2C shows typical scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) images of graphene foam before (top) and after (bottom)
CrHCF thin-film deposition. The substrate shows a branch-like structure,
but after the deposition of CrHCF thin films, the structure appears
to be homogeneously covered with the deposit and shows a smooth topology
with an average feature size of about 166 nm. X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of CrHCF thin films deposited on flat
Pt electrodes (see Figure 2D) indicates the presence of all key elements, Fe, K, and
Cr.

The presence of K-related peaks in the XPS data suggests
that not
all K+ cations are removed from the CrHCF thin films during
deintercalation (CrHCF is in the deintercalated state, Figure 2D). The investigation of Fe
2p1/2 and Fe 2p3/2 peaks reveals that the main
oxidation state of iron after deintercalation is +3 (at ∼713.39
and ∼727.13 eV for Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2, respectively); also, the peaks with less peak area and reduced
binding energy can be observed alongside these peaks (at ∼711.99
and ∼724.91 eV for Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2, respectively).

According to Yamashita and Hayes,23 these
peaks can be assigned to FeII, caused by partially divergent
oxidation of Fe during the K deintercalation process. Therefore, the
tentative reaction scheme for intercalation/deintercalation of K ions
in CrHCF thin films can be proposed as following 1  

According to recent
studies,13,18,24 anions participate
in the intercalation/deintercalation processes
and affect the reversibility and stability of the electrode materials.
The influence of the electrolyte composition on the reversibility
and stability of CrHCF thin films was investigated using 0.25 M K-containing
electrolytes, namely KNO3, KCl, KOAc (potassium acetate),
and K2SO4.

The shapes of CVs look similar
regardless of the anions present
in the electrolytes, whereas the potential of K intercalation/deintercalation
varies (see Figure 3A). Among the studied electrolytes, the long-term stability tests
of CrHCF electrodes showed the highest cycle stability in 0.25 M KNO3 solutions (ca. 57% of the initial capacity), as shown in Figure 3B. The worst stability
was observed for the sample in 0.25 M KOAc, which retained only ∼21%
of its initial charge capacity after only 50 cycles. The large channels
of PBAs have been shown to be able to host different cations.13,25Figure 3C shows the
CVs of CrHCF thin films in 0.25 M XNO3 electrolytes (X
= Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs) characterizing quasi-reversible intercalation/deintercalation
of different alkali metal cations into/from CrHCF. The shapes of CVs
in different electrolytes appear similar except for the case of 0.25
M CsNO3, but the positions of the CVs are slightly different.
Subsequently, the long-term cycling tests of CrHCF thin films were
performed in different electrolytes for 1000 cycles (see Figure 3D). CrHCF thin films
cycled in NaNO3 and KNO3 showed the best stabilities
after 1000 cycles, reaching ∼56 and ∼57% of the initial
capacity, respectively.

CVs of CrHCF electrodes and (B) their long-term cycling tests in 0.25

thin films and (D) their long-term cycling tests in 0.25 M LiNO3 (yellow), 0.25 M NaNO3 (olive), 0.25 M KNO3 (blue), 0.25 M RbNO3 (purple), and 0.25 M CsNO3 (black).

The specific capacity
of a CrHCF electrode in 0.25 M NaNO3 was measured at multiple
C rates to investigate the rate performance
(see Figure 4A). The
resulting specific capacities strongly depended on the applied C rate
(summarized in Table 1). At 10 C, the electrode showed a specific capacity of ∼88
mA h/g, and the specific capacities tend to be lower at higher C rates.
The half-charge potential (E1/2) of CrHCF
thin films slightly varies depending on the nature of the alkali metal
cations in different electrolytes as shown in Figure 4B.

specific capacity (mA h/g)	∼89	∼88	∼81	∼76	∼73	∼71	∼68	∼58	
In contrast to the case of NiHCF,13 the
half-charge potentials of CrHCF only slightly depend on the hydration
energy of alkali metal cations, similar to VHCF.17Figure 4C shows a good correlation between the E1/2 potentials for different PBAs (NiHCF, CoHCF, CuHCF, VHCF, and CrHCF)
and the empirical radii of the key TM1 elements of PBAs.
The larger the empirical radii of the transition metals TM1 in PBAs, the higher the E1/2 potentials
are.

Using CrHCF, we have also constructed a symmetric cell
(quasi-supercapacitor
with two identical CrHCF electrodes) operating at 100 C, with the
maximum initial operational voltage of 0.95 V (see Figure 4D). It demonstrated a specific
capacity of ∼19 mA h/g and a specific energy density of ∼4.6
W h/kg. At 120 C, the Coulombic efficiency exhibited ∼99.6%.
These values slightly outperform those of commercially available nonaqueous
supercapacitor systems for power grids and industrial applications
(energy density of ∼3–4 W h/kg and maximum efficiency
at nominal power of 98.6%).27,28

The good rate
performance of CrHCF electrodes would position them
between battery and supercapacitor materials, opening the possibility
of future application of this material in hybrid ESSs. If the CrHCF
electrode is combined with an appropriate Na battery anode, such as
a phosphorene–graphene anode,29 the
recently reported high-rate TiO2 anode,30 or MnHCM,18 it would result
in a full cell with excellent voltage and rate capability.

Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated electrodeposited CrHCF thin films
as an affordable cathode material for aqueous Na+ and K+ ion batteries. CrHCF electrodes exhibited the E1/2 potential of ∼0.69 and ∼0.72 V versus
SSC for Na and K intercalation, respectively, and a high specific
capacity of ∼88 mA h/g at 10 C, with excellent cycling stability
and capacity retention of ∼60% after 1000 cycles. Surprisingly,
the choice of electrolytes has a significant influence on the cycle
life. The electrode potential of PBAs appears to be adjustable by
replacing N-coordinated transition metals with others. The symmetric
cell using two CrHCF electrodes showed a high voltage of 0.95 V and
an energy density of ∼4.6 W h/kg at 100 C. The high availability
of raw resources for the fabrication of CrHCF electrodes should enable
the use of this material in large-scale ESSs.

Experimental Section
Electrochemical measurements were carried out in an electrochemical
glass cell in Ar-saturated electrolytes (Argon 5.0 Westfalen AG) using
a three-electrode configuration and a VSP-300 potentiostat (Bio-Logic,
France) to control the experiments. Graphene/thermoplastic polyurethane
flexible foam (Graphene Supermarket, USA) and AT-cut Pt quartz crystals
(Standford Research Systems, USA) served as working electrodes and
substrates, respectively, for the electrochemical deposition of CrHCF
thin films. A Pt wire and 3 M KCl Ag/AgCl (SSC, Schott) were used
as a counter and a reference electrode, respectively. The electrochemical
deposition of CrHCF thin films was performed using a deposition solution
containing 0.25 M KNO3, 10 mM CrCl3 (prepared
from CrCl3·6H2O, 95%, Sigma-Aldrich, Germany),
and 5 mM K3Fe[(CN)6] (∼99%, ReagentPlus,
Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) in ultrapure water (Evoqua, Germany) by cycling
electrode potential between −1.1 and 1.25 V versus SSC at a
scan rate of 50 mV s–1. Cyclic voltammetry analysis
of the resulting CrHCF thin films was performed in different electrolytes
(0.25 M KNO3, 0.25 M KCl, 0.25 M K2SO4, 0.25 M KCH3COO, 0.25 M LiNO3, 0.25 M NaNO3, 0.25 M KNO3, 0.25 M RbNO3, and 0.25
M CsNO3, all ReagentPlus, Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) to investigate
the electrochemical characteristics and battery performance. For that,
the electrode potential was cycled from −0.6 to 1.2 V versus
SSC for 1000 cycles at a rate of 50 mV s–1. Battery
capacitance determination tests of CrHCF thin films were carried out
in the 0.25 M NaNO3 electrolyte at different C rates (5,
10, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 360 C). A 0.95 V symmetric cell (a quasi-supercapacitor)
was constructed using two CrHCF thin-film electrodes and the 0.25
M NaNO3 aqueous electrolyte; and its charge–discharge
test was performed at 100 C. Prior to the XPS measurements, the electrochemically
deposited CrHCF thin films were rinsed with pure water several times
to remove possible residues of still-adsorbed chemicals and then dried
in ambient conditions. It should be noted here that the drying procedure
in ambient conditions did not introduce any functional changes of
the CrHCF thin films, neither in electrochemical nor XPS measurements.
The XPS setup included SPECS GmbH XR50 X-ray source with Al anode
(Kα line at 1486.61 eV), a SPECS GmbH spectrometer, and SPECS
GmbH PHOIBOS 150 hemispherical energy analyzer. High-resolution field
emission SEM analysis of the deposited films was performed on Zeiss
NVision 40, operated at 3 kV.
