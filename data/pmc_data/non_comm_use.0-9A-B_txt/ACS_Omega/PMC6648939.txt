Understanding
and quantification of cosolvent influences on enzyme-catalyzed reactions
are driven by a twofold interest. On the one hand, cosolvents can
simulate the cellular environment for deeper understanding of in cellulo
reaction conditions. On the other hand, cosolvents are applied in
biotechnology to tune yield and kinetics of reactions. Further, cosolvents
are even present inherently, for example, for reactions with cofactor
regeneration or for enzymes that need cosolvents in a function of
a stabilizer. As the experimental determination of yield and kinetics
is costly and time consuming, this work aims at providing a thermodynamic
predictive approach that might allow screening cosolvent influences
on yield and Michaelis constants. Reactions investigated in this work
are the reduction of butanone and 2-pentanone under the influence
of 17 wt % of the cosolvent polyethylene glycol 6000, which is also
often used as a crowder to simulate cellular environments. The considered
reactions were catalyzed by a genetically modified alcohol dehydrogenase
(ADH 270). Predictions of cosolvent influences are based on accounting
for a cosolvent-induced change of molecular interactions among the
reacting agents as well as between the reacting agents and the solvent.
Such interactions were characterized by activity coefficients of the
reacting agents that were predicted by means of electrolyte perturbed-chain
statistical associating fluid theory. This allowed simultaneously
predicting the cosolvent effects on yield and Michaelis constants
for two-substrate reactions for the first time.

Introduction
Biocatalytic processes
are rising within the chemical industry as they often present meaningful
alternatives to chemically catalyzed routes. New developments in enzyme
design and a deeper understanding into biocatalysis lead to highly
suitable catalysts for the production of fine chemicals1 and for a wider range of applications.2 Enzymes enable reaction catalysis under mild
conditions (often ambient pressure and temperature), while providing
high selectivity toward one product often with high enantioselectivity.3,4 Further, the application of enzymes can turn environmentally hazardous
reactions requiring strong acids or toxic solvents into “green”
reactions, minimizing waste, and emissions.5,6

Enzyme-catalyzed reactions are characterized by the key properties
reaction equilibrium and reaction rate, and the latter contains kinetic
parameters such as Michaelis constants.7,8 The Michaelis
constant is an indicator for the cellular concentration range of a
substrate as any increase of the substrate’s concentration
above the value of the Michaelis constant will maximally double the
reaction rate. Thus, (micro-)organisms use substrate concentrations
often not much higher than the value for the Michaelis constant.8,9 While the reaction equilibrium is known to be independent of the
catalyst as long as the catalyst is present at low concentration,10−14 the reaction rate and Michaelis constants strongly depend on the
catalyst.15,16 Further, both, reaction equilibrium and
Michaelis constants strongly depend on the reaction medium, which
might be tuned by the addition of cosolvents. This influence of cosolvents
is often described empirically based on experimental data, which is
costly and time consuming. Thus, it is desired to predict the cosolvent
influence on reaction equilibrium and on Michaelis constants without
the requirement of experimental data concerning the reactive system
containing cosolvents. Such predictions are important for the design
and improvement of biochemical reactions. Further, the ability to
quantitatively predict such behavior enables a deeper understanding
of the reason behind the cosolvent influence on reaction equilibrium
and Michaelis constants. Especially, the interaction between cosolvent
and the active site(s) of an enzyme is studied in the literature;
commonly, this is done at an atomistic level using molecular dynamics
simulation for the direct interaction between solvent molecules and
single amino acids of the enzyme’s active site.17−19 While these studies try to get access to molecular interactions
on the single atom level, previous works from the literature20,21 and by our group10,11,13−16,22 have shown that these detailed
studies might not be required to predict cosolvent influences on the
reaction equilibrium and Michaelis constants of enzyme-catalyzed reactions.
Thus, cosolvent–enzyme interactions are not decisive given
that the cosolvent does neither denature the enzyme nor acts as a
substrate/inhibitor.

That is, predictions of cosolvent influences
on reaction equilibrium and Michaelis constants of reactions are based
on understanding and quantification of molecular interactions among
the reacting agents and between the reacting agents and the solvent
(cosolvent) in the reaction mixture. For this purpose, changes of
the chemical potential are quantified in form of activity coefficients
of the reacting agents in the presence of the cosolvent. The most
prominent models proposed for the prediction of these molecular interactions
are the electrolyte nonrandom two-liquid model,23 the Debye–Hückel extended UNIQUAC equation,24 the Pitzer model,25 the conductor-like screening model,26 or the electrolyte perturbed-chain statistical associating fluid
theory (ePC-SAFT) equation of state.27 As
was shown by Grosch,21 Pleiss,20 and previous work,11,15,16 these models are capable to predict cosolvent
influences on activity coefficients of reacting agents properly. In
this work, ePC-SAFT is used for this purpose for several reasons:
first, the reacting agents are charged species which requires an electrolyte
model; second, polymers are considered as cosolvents in this work,
and classical PC-SAFT is especially suitable for polymer/solvent systems;28 third, ePC-SAFT has shown to be able to predict
activity coefficients in electrolyte systems consisting of multiple
components in previous works.10,13,14,22,29,30

The reactions studied in this work
are the reduction of butanone and the reduction of 2-pentanone, catalyzed
by a genetically modified alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH 270) with the
required cofactor NADH + H+ at pH 7, 30 °C, and 1
bar. The reaction mechanism of such ketone reductions is shown in Figure 1. Please note that
the true reacting species [NADH]2– will be referred
to as NADH, and [NAD+]− will be referred
to as NAD+ according to recommendations,31 previous work,10,13 and textbook knowledge.32

Figure 1 Reaction scheme of the reduction of a ketone (in this
work: butanone and 2-pentanone) to the respective alcohol (in this
work: butanol and 2-pentanol) with the cofactor nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide in its protonated form (NADH + H+) and deprotonated
form (NAD+) catalyzed by a genetically modified alcohol
dehydrogenase (ADH 270) in aqueous medium.

In this work, the reduction of the substrates butanone and
2-pentanone were investigated because of previous work on the aromatic
ketone acetophenone and the successful predictions of the reaction
equilibrium10 and the Michaelis constants15,16 under cosolvent influence. The cosolvent regarded in this work is
polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG 6000) with a concentration of 17 wt
%. PEG was used in this work, as it is chemically inert, and thus,
it is not involved in the reaction as a reacting participant. Although
PEG is often applied in similar concentration ranges as an enhancer
for reactions33−36 or as a phase former for aqueous two-phase systems which is required
for in situ product removal,37−42 PEG is also suitable as a crowder molecule for the study of reactions
on a more cellular level.43,44

The approach
presented in this work might be used as a screening tool for the influence
of cosolvents on reaction equilibrium and Michaelis constants of many
other enzyme-catalyzed reactions. This allows more efficient process
design in future and a better understanding of reactions under in
cellulo conditions.

Theoretical Framework
Reaction Equilibrium
The thermodynamic equilibrium constant Kth for the reduction of butanone and 2-pentanone can be determined
according to eq 1. 1  

In this work, species-averaged activity coefficients of NAD+ and NADH were used to reduce the complexity of the system
without sacrificing the quality of the predictions as shown in previous
works and thus Kth reference to the biochemical
reference state commonly indicated by Kth′.10,15,16 As Kxobs (the ratio of the mole fractions of the reacting agents at equilibrium)
strongly depends on kind and concentration of the cosolvent, it is
further referred to as an observed (obs) value; thus, it is not a constant value. In contrast to eq 1, the activity of H+ is transferred
to the side of Kth in eq 2. 2   3   4  

This was done as
the pH was kept constant by the use of a 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic
acid (HEPES) buffer, and thus, the activity of H+ was constant
in this work, which leads to a constant value for Kth·aH+. Although H+ is a reacting agent, the H+-free mole-fraction ratio Xobs is a more suitable indicator for the equilibrium
position, and thus, Xobs is further used
instead of Kxobs.

Measuring Xobs for the neat (cosolvent free) conditions and having
access to Γ by means of ePC-SAFT predicted activity coefficients
allows determining the cosolvent independent value Kth·aH+. On the basis of this
constant value (at constant temperature and pH), the influence of
cosolvents is expressed in Γ, which then allows predicting Xpre. This prediction is based on minimizing
the objective function OF1 as shown in eq 5 iteratively. A scheme of the iteration process
including input parameters and the iteration loop is given in the Supporting Information. 5   6  

Reaction Kinetics
The Michaelis–Menten equation for a two-substrate reaction
is expressed with eq 7 as proposed in the literature.7,8 7  KM strongly depends on kind and concentration of cosolvent;
thus, the measured value for KM is denoted
as the observed value KMobs in the following. In eq 7, ν′ is the reaction
rate normalized to the total enzyme concentration mE; this is required to make experiments with different
enzyme concentrations comparable to each other. Further, KM,ketoneobs and KM,NADHobs represent the Michaelis constants of the
ketone (butanone; 2-pentanone) and NADH, respectively. The highest
achievable normalized reaction rate is given by kcat, while mketone and mNADH denote the initial molalities of the respective
ketone substrate (butanone; 2-pentanone) and NADH. Ki,NADHobs represents
the inhibition constant of NADH toward the ketone substrate; combined
with KM,NADHobs the exact value of the inhibition constant
is required to define the reaction mechanism. If Ki,NADHobs proves
to be equal to KM,NADHobs a random binding mechanism is prevailing,
while a ping-pong mechanism is present if Ki,NADHobs = 0. Otherwise,
an ordered binding mechanism is given in which NADH (or the ketone)
binds first if Ki,NADHobs < KM,NADHobs (or if Ki,NADHobs > KM,NADHobs).7,45 To determine all the
kinetic properties KM,ketoneobs, KM,NADHobs, kcat, and Ki,NADHobs, a two-step linearization was applied
in this work. A detailed description of the two-step linearization
is given in the Supporting Information.
To convert KM,ketoneobs and KM,NADHobs to their activity-based
Michaelis constants KM,ketonea and KM,NADHa, molalities in eq 7 were replaced by thermodynamic
activities a = mi·γim, leading to eq 8 8  

The big
advantage of KM,ketonea and KM,NADHa over their molality-based
pendants is that KM,ketonea and KM,NADHa are independent of any cosolvent.
It was shown in our own previous works15,16 and in other
literature20,21,46 that converting molalities to thermodynamic activities does still
preserve information on the reaction mechanism; thus, the assumptions
needed to derive eq 7 as given in the literature7,8 are not violated. KM,ketonea and KM,NADHa were determined in analogy to KM,ketoneobs and KM,NADHobs through the two-step linearization presented.
The ePC-SAFT predictions of KM,ketoneobs and KM,NADHobs under
cosolvent influence are described in detail in the Supporting Information.

As predictions for Xobs and KMobs under cosolvent influence require
the respective activity coefficients of the reacting agents in the
reaction mixture, the prediction of activity coefficients is required.
This was done by means of ePC-SAFT which is presented in the following.

ePC-SAFT
To predict activity coefficients, the pure-component
reference state was used in this work, indicated by the subscript
0i. Further, activity coefficients were predicted
by using the respective fugacity coefficients φi as shown in eq 9. Note that γi is the mole
fraction-based activity coefficient that can be transferred into the
molality-based activity coefficient γim according to eq 10 9   10  

The required residual Helmholtz energy ares to predict φi and φ0i was calculated with ePC-SAFT.27 11  

The four free-energy
contributions to calculate ares are explained in the Supporting Information. To describe mixtures,47,48 combining rules proposed by Berthelot and Lorentz49,50 and Wolbach–Sandler51 were applied
in this work. These are combining rules for the mean segment diameter,
mean dispersion-energy parameter and mean association-energy parameter.
Only one binary interaction parameter kij was used in this work as shown in eq 14. 12   13   14  

The ePC-SAFT pure-component and binary
interaction parameters used in this work are listed in Tables 1 and 2.

Results and Discussion
Reaction Equilibrium
For the reaction
equilibrium of the neat reactions and the validation with ePC-SAFT
predictions the influence of 17 wt % PEG 6000 was studied with initial
molalities of mketone,0 = mNADH,0 = 0.5 mmol/kgwater.

The results
of the equilibrium measurements under neat conditions for the reduction
of butanone and 2-pentanone are shown in Figure 2. The detailed mole fractions of each reacting
agents at equilibrium are given in Tables S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information.

Figure 2 Experimental results
for the reaction equilibrium expressed as Xexp under neat (cosolvent free) reaction conditions at 30 °C, 1
bar, and pH 7. Results for the reduction of butanone and 2-pentanone
are shown for initial ketone molalities of 0.5 mmol/kgwater and for initial NADH molalities of 0.5 mmol/kgwater,
respectively. Detailed experimental data is given in Tables S1 and
S2 in the Supporting Information.

As can be seen from Figure 2 for both reduction reactions,
the reaction equilibrium position is located strongly on the side
of the respective alcohol (butanol; 2-pentanol) as Xexp ≫ 1. Further, Xexp(2-pentanone reduction) = 100.1 ± 11.7 mol/mol is about 1.25
fold larger than Xexp(butanone reduction)
= 81.2 ± 17.9 mol/mol. It is also visible that the uncertainty
for Xexp is greater for the butanone reduction
than for the 2-pentanone reduction, which is not unexpected because
of the higher volatility of butanone over 2-pentanone. For both reduction
reactions, the observed equilibrium composition Xexp was converted into the thermodynamic equilibrium constant Kth by using the ePC-SAFT predicted activity-coefficient
ratios Γ. Predictions of Γ were based on the parameters
from Tables 1 and 2. The predicted activity coefficients are listed
in Table S3 in the Supporting Information. The predicted values for Γ and Kth·aH+ are given in Table 3. Note that the uncertainty in the experimental
data was not transferred into the predicted value of Kth·aH+.

The respective Kth·aH+ values were
used to predict Xexp under the influence
of 17 wt % of PEG 6000 based on eq 5. The results of the predictions and the validation
with experimental data are given in Figure 3 and Table 4. A detailed list of all mole fractions at equilibrium
under 17 wt % of PEG 6000 for both reduction reactions is given in
Tables S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information. Note that no experimental data of the reaction was used to fit
any of the ePC-SAFT parameters and thus, the presented predictions
are independent from any reaction data.

ePC-SAFT-predicted influence of 17 wt % of PEG 6000 on Xexp for the reduction of butanone and 2-pentanone, respectively

bars) at 30 °C, 1 bar, and pH 7. Striped bars represent the neat
(cosolvent free) values used to determine Kth·aH+. ePC-SAFT predictions were based
on the parameters listed in Tables 1 and 2.

a ePC-SAFT predictions of Xpre were based on the parameters listed in Tables 1 and 2.

As can be clearly seen
from Figure 3 and Table 4, ePC-SAFT is capable
of predicting the cosolvent influence of 17 wt % PEG 6000 on Xexp of the reduction of butanone and 2-pentanone.
For Xexp of the 2-pentanone reduction
predictions are close to quantitatively correct within the experimental
uncertainties. The higher deviation in the predictions for butanone
can be explained in the larger uncertainty in the experimental neat
data used to determine Kth·aH+.

These findings are discussed in the following.
It might be expected that the ketones or alcohols are affected differently
upon PEG addition. To investigate this, the ratio of activity coefficients
of the reacting agents were analyzed. The activity coefficients of
the reacting agents show that the ratio γbutanone(neat)/γbutanone(PEG) = 2.3 is very close to the
ratio γ2-pentanone(neat)/γ2-pentanone(PEG) = 2.4. The same was observed for the activity-coefficient ratios
of the respective alcohols butanol and 2-pentanol, and even for the
substrate NADH. That is, PEG influences these activity-coefficient
ratios very similarly, which in sum does not explain the reason behind
the strong PEG influence on reaction equilibrium. In contrast, the
ratio γNAD+(neat)/γNAD+(PEG) for the reduction of butanone was predicted to
be 0.039, whereas γNAD+(neat)/γNAD+(PEG) for the reduction of 2-pentanone was predicted
to be 0.065. This shows that the significantly higher PEG influence
on 2-pentanone reduction is caused by the influence of PEG on the
molecular interactions involving NAD+. While this is an
unexpected result, activity coefficients have been identified to be
relevant even for reaction with isomers.58 Thus, even for similar systems, a general cosolvent influence on
reaction equilibria cannot be deduced.

To conclude, it was shown
that Xexp for the reduction of butanone
and 2-pentanone under neat conditions was similar within the experimental
uncertainties, while the influence of 17 wt % of PEG 6000 was vastly
different for both reactions. This proves that even for similar substrates
that only differ by one methyl group (−CH2−),
assumptions of similar molecular interactions between the substrates
and the cosolvent PEG 6000 might be very unreasonable, which showcases
the need of a thermodynamic model to predict these interactions correctly
and nonempirically. Because of the ability to account for the molecular
interactions based on the residual Helmholtz energy predicted by ePC-SAFT,
a quantification and prediction of the cosolvent effect of 17 wt %
of PEG 6000 was possible for both reduction reactions. This further
shows that thermodynamic activities lead to cosolvent independent
constants, which should be chosen in future rather than falsely labeled
molality-based “constants” which are
not constant values at all.

Michaelis Constants
The influence
of 17 wt % PEG 6000 on the kinetic parameters KM,ketoneobs and KM,NADHobs was measured and predicted in this work. Figure 4 shows the primary plots for the reduction of butanone and 2-pentanone. The experimental
results of (ν′)−1 for each molality
of the ketones and NADH are given in Tables S4 and S5 in the Supporting Information.

Figure 4 Primary plots for the determination of KM,ketoneobs and KM,NADHobs under
neat (cosolvent free) conditions for the reduction of butanone and
2-pentanone at 30 °C, 1 bar, and pH 7 catalyzed by ADH 270. Reciprocal
normalized reaction rate (ν′)−1 is
plotted over the reciprocal initial molality of NADH mNADH–1 for pseudo-constant molalities
of butanone (triangles: 30 mmol/kgwater; squares: 50 mmol/kgwater; circles: 250 mmol/kgwater) in the left and
pseudo-constant molalities of 2-pentanone (triangles: 30 mmol/kgwater; squares: 50 mmol/kgwater; circles: 100 mmol/kgwater) in the right diagram.15

Figure 4 shows that the normalized reaction rate
observed for the reduction of 2-pentanone is slightly higher than
for the reduction of butanone for the same molalities of 30 and 50
mmol/kgwater of the ketones, respectively. Further, a linear
relation between (ν′)−1 and mNADH–1 for each pseudo-constant
molality of the respective ketone can be observed. The resulting secondary plots required for the determination of KM,ketoneobs and KM,NADHobs are given in Figures S3 and S4 in
the Supporting Information. Table 5 lists the experimentally determined
Michaelis constants from the secondary plots under
neat conditions for the ketone and NADH, respectively.

butanone	14.0 ± 4.1	1.3 ± 0.1	
2-pentanone15	15.8 ± 1.6	1.0 ± 0.1	
It can be
observed that KMobs values for the ketone and NADH are similar
for both reactions. As observed also for Xexp under neat conditions, KMobs of butanone shows a larger uncertainty
than for 2-pentanone, which can also be denoted to the higher volatility
of butanone. It is noteworthy that the higher uncertainties arise
from taking into account the uncertainties of each experimental data
point in the primary and secondary plots by a Gaussian propagation of uncertainty (Taylor expansion) and
not the R2 of the fit lines. This leads
to realistic experimental uncertainties in the determination of KMobs, highlighting the need of a predictive model to reduce experimental
efforts and costs further.

As first step for predictions of KMobs, the activity-based Michaelis constants KMa were determined
based on eq 8. The activity-based primary plots are given in Figure 5. Note that activity coefficient were predicted
with the same ePC-SAFT parameters from Tables 1 and 2, as for the
activity-coefficient predictions of Kth·aH+.

mmol/kgwater; circles: 100 mmol/kgwater) in
the right diagram.15

As can be clearly seen from Figure 5, the kinetic information of the reactions
are preserved from the molality-based primary plots given in Figure 4. These include the increased reaction rate for increased molalities
of the ketone, the linear relation required to obtain the secondary plots, and the intersects of the fit lines in
the second quadrant of the diagram. The activity coefficients predicted
to obtain the activities of NADH and the resulting secondary
plots are given in Tables S8 and S9, Figures S5 and S6 in
the Supporting Information. Predicted values
for KMa and Ki,NADHa required for the predictions of KMobs under
the influence of 17 wt % of PEG 6000 are listed in Table 6.

a Required activity coefficients were predicted with

While KMobs are mostly equal for both reactions, KMa values especially of the ketones differ significantly from each
other for both reactions. This is caused by the nonideality of the
reaction mixtures, which is different because of the different ketones
present in the respective reaction. As can be seen from Tables S8
and S9 in the Supporting Information, activity
coefficients of NADH are similar for both reactions. This is not the
case for the activity coefficients of butanone and 2-pentanone (Table
S10 in the Supporting Information). Activity
coefficients of butanone are vastly different from being unity (γbutanone ≠ 1), whereas activity coefficients of 2-pentanone
are much closer to unity. This shows that the reaction mixtures containing
butanone are stronger nonideal than the reaction mixtures containing
2-pentanone. The determined activity-based Michaelis constants (Table 7) were used to predict
the influence of 17 wt % of PEG 6000 on KMobs. The results
of the predictions and a
comparison to experimental data are given in Figure 6 and Table 7.

of the neat reaction are also provided. Activity coefficients required
for the predictions were estimated with ePC-SAFT based on the parameters
from Tables 1 and 2.

Figure 6 and Table 7 show that ePC-SAFT predicts
a decrease for KM,ketoneobs and KM,NADHobs for the
reduction of butanone and 2-pentanone under the influence of 17 wt
% PEG 6000 compared with their neat reaction mixtures. While the decrease
of KM,NADHobs is predicted to be mostly equal for both
reactions, the decrease of KM,butanoneobs is predicted to be
twofold larger than that of KM,2-pentanoneobs, thus showing
that the influence of 17 wt % PEG 6000 is not equal for both reactions.
Comparing the ePC-SAFT predictions with experimental data for the
reactions under 17 wt % PEG 6000 influence (primary and secondary plots including the detailed values
given in Tables S12 to S15 and Figures S7 to S9 in the Supporting Information) shows an at least qualitative
agreement between KMpre and KMobs for the reduction of butanone
and qualitative to quantitative predictions for the reduction of 2-pentanone.

To conclude, experimental Michaelis constants KMobs for the
reduction of butanone and 2-pentanone under neat conditions were similar
within the experimental uncertainties. Interestingly, the same was
observed also for the reaction equilibrium of both reaction under
neat conditions. However, the influence of 17 wt % of PEG 6000 on KMobs was unexpected: While KM,NADHobs was decreased by a factor of two for
both reduction reactions under cosolvent, KM,ketoneobs was decreased
differently strong for both reactions. These findings show that both
Michaelis constant are not necessarily influenced in the same way
when a cosolvent is present. This cosolvent effect on KMobs, caused
by different molecular interactions for both reduction reactions,
was successfully predicted with ePC-SAFT in the form of the respective
activity coefficients of the ketone and NADH under neat conditions
and under the influence of 17 wt % of PEG 6000. Additionally, this
approach proves that the enzyme–cosolvent interactions play
a minor role in the change of KMobs under cosolvent influence.
In sum, the use of PEG was found to be very meaningful as the kinetics
of both reactions could be improved strongly, as all Michaelis constants
were significantly reduced upon PEG addition.

Conclusion
To conclude, this work aimed at providing the base for a thermodynamic
activity-based framework that might enable the prediction of cosolvent
influences on reaction equilibria and Michaelis constants of enzyme-catalyzed
reactions. This framework accounts for cosolvent effects on the interactions
among reacting agents and between reacting agents and solvent, which
seem to be the key for predicting reaction equilibria under cosolvent
influence. Further, the framework accounts for cosolvent-induced interactions
between solvent and substrate. In contrast, enzyme interactions are
not taken into account for predicting Michaelis constants and reaction
equilibria.

This work feeds the thermodynamic activity-based
approach by ePC-SAFT predicted activity coefficients of the reacting
agents under cosolvent influence. The approach was applied to successfully
predict the influence of 17 wt % of PEG 6000 on reaction equilibria
and Michaelis constants of the reductions of butanone and 2-pentanone
catalyzed by the enzyme ADH 270. The quality of the predictions means
a significant improvement over other literature works which describe
cosolvent effects empirically. It further shows that enzyme-independent
substrate–cosolvent interactions are the major driving force
for the cosolvent induced changes in the Michaelis constants. This
is expressed by the activity coefficients of the substrates upon PEG
addition. Additionally, these findings indicate that cosolvent–enzyme
interactions might play a minor role compared with substrate–cosolvent
interactions. These findings support hypotheses from our previous
publications and enlarge the applicability range of the developed
activity-based approach.

The quality of the simultaneous predictions
of reaction equilibria and Michaelis constants points to the importance
to account for thermodynamic activities to understand and quantify
cosolvent effects on reaction equilibrium and Michaelis constants
of enzymatic reactions. This approach provides a framework that might
enable the screening of cosolvents a priori to avoid time-consuming
and costly experiments and allows next steps toward predictions of
enzymatic reactions in cellulo.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals
In this work, HEPES and PEG 6000 were purchased from VWR International.
2-Pentanone and β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide disodium
salt (NADHNa2) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Sodium
hydroxide (NaOH) and butanone were purchased from Alfa Aesar. The
genetically modified alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH 270) was obtained
from evoxx technologies. All chemicals were used without further purification
and all samples were prepared using Millipore water from the Milli-Q
provided by Merck Millipore. An overview of all chemicals used in
this work is given in Table S16 in the Supporting Information.

Kinetic and Equilibrium Measurements
Kinetic and equilibrium measurements were carried out in 0.1 mol/kgwater HEPES buffer adjusted to a pH of 7 with sodium hydroxide
at temperature T = 303.15 K and p = 1 bar. The pH of the buffer and each sample was measured with
a pH electrode from Mettler Toledo (uncertainty ± 0.01).

In this work, 17 wt % of PEG 6000 was added to the buffer to mimic
the cosolvent. The stability and activity of ADH 270 in the buffer
and under the influence of PEG 6000 was proven in a previous work.15 In the first step for the kinetic measurements,
the stock solutions of the respective ketone (butanone; 2-pentanone)
were prepared in equal number to the NADH molalities measured. The
ketone was added gravimetrically to an Eppendorf cup on a XS analytical
scale provided by Mettler Toledo (uncertainty ± 0.01 mg) and
mixed with buffer afterward. The Eppendorf cups were filled to the
maximum capacity to decrease the vapor phase, minimizing losses of
ketone during the short storage time before experiments. The ketone
stock solutions were preheated after preparation in an Eppendorf ThermoMixer
C at 30 °C. Butanone molalities of the neat reaction investigated
were 30, 50, and 250 mmol/kgwater and 30, 50, and 100 mmol/kgwater for the PEG 6000 measurements. 2-Pentanone molalities
investigated were 30, 50, and 100 mmol/kgwater for neat
and PEG 6000 measurements. Afterward, NADH was added gravimetrically
to the ketone solution. A NADH stock solution was not used because
of known instability of NADH in solution.57 Thus, NADH solutions were freshly prepared with NADH molalities
of 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, and 0.35 mmol/kgwater. The
enzyme stock solution was prepared by gravimetrically adding 1 wt
% of enzyme to 2 mL of buffer and storage of the Eppendorf cup on
ice. To initiate the kinetic measurements 20 mg of the enzyme solution
were transferred into a quartz cuvette supRAsil TYP 114-QS from Hellma
Analytics which was preheated to 30 °C in an Eppendorf BioSpectrometer
and direct addition of 1 g substrate solution containing the respective
ketone (butanone or 2-pentanone) and NADH. The extinction measurement
over time was carried out at 340 nm wavelength (extinction maxima
of NADH). The respective calibration curves and extinction coefficients
of NADH in the buffer and in buffer + 17 wt % PEG 6000 are given in
Figure S1 the Supporting Information.

For reaction equilibrium measurements sample preparation was identical
to the kinetic measurements with the only difference in the considered
molalities. For the reduction of butanone and 2-pentanone under neat
and 17 wt % of PEG 6000 influence equimolar concentrations of the
ketone and NADH were used. This was done to ensure the determination
of equilibrium position with lowest experimental uncertainty (uncertainty
increases by using much lower substrate molalities). Molalities of
NADH and the respective ketone (butanone or 2-pentanone) were chosen
to be 0.5 mmol/kgwater. Measurements of the reaction equilibrium
were performed by extinction over time measurements until the extinction
did not change (dE/dt = 0). Equilibrium
position was then verified by addition of the substrate solution (ketone
and NADH) to check if the enzyme was still active and not denatured
(shown in Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). Data reduction of the equilibrium measurements was done based
on a mole balance as shown in eq 15. 15
