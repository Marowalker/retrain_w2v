Tin oxide (SnO2) has been
widely accepted as an effective
electron transport layer (ETL) for optoelectronic devices because
of its outstanding electro-optical properties such as its suitable
band energy levels, high electron mobility, and high transparency.
Here, we report a simple but effective interfacial engineering strategy
to achieve highly efficient and stable inverted organic solar cells
(iOSCs) via a low-temperature solution process and an SnO2 ETL modified by zwitterion nondetergent sulfobetaine 3-(4-tert-butyl-1-pyridinio)-1-propanesulfonate (NDSB-256-4T).
We found that NDSB-256-4T helps reduce the work function of SnO2, resulting in more efficient electron extraction and transport
to the cathode of iOSCs. NDSB-256-4T also passivates the defects in
SnO2, which serves as recombination centers that greatly
reduce the device performance of iOSCs. In addition, NDSB-256-4T provides
the better interfacial contact between SnO2 and the active
layer. Thus, a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) and longer
device stability of iOSCs are expected for a combination of SnO2 and NDSB-256-4T than for devices based on SnO2 only. With these enhanced interfacial properties, P3HT:PC60BM-based iOSCs using SnO2/NDSB-256-4T (0.2 mg/mL) as an
ETL showed both a higher average PCE of 3.72%, which is 33% higher
than devices using SnO2 only (2.79%) and excellent device
stability (over 90% of the initial PCE remained after storing 5 weeks
in ambient air without encapsulation). In an extended application
of the PTB7-Th:PC70BM systems, we achieved an impressive
average PCE of 8.22% with SnO2/NDSB-256-4T (0.2 mg/mL)
as the ETL, while devices based on SnO2 exhibited an average
PCE of only 4.45%. Thus, the use of zwitterion to modify SnO2 ETL is a promising way to obtain both highly efficient and stable
iOSCs.

1 Introduction
In
the field of renewable energy field, bulk heterojunction solar
cells (OSCs), which are normally based on conjugated polymer donors
and fullerene derivative acceptors, have attracted particular attention
from researchers as third generation solar cells because of their
outstanding advantages (low cost abundant materials, light weight,
simple solution preparation processing, and high compatibility with
roll-to-roll manufacturing techniques on flexible substrates).1−5 Considerable progress has been achieved for OSCs because of the
great efforts in developing novel donor–acceptor materials
and interfacial engineering.6,7 To date, the highest
power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs with single-junction
and tandem structures are approaching 16.5 and 17.3%, respectively.8−10 However, among the three essential characteristics of photovoltaic
technology (efficiency, scalability, and stability),11 the stability of OSC devices with an average lifetime of
more than 10 years is still considered as the real hurdle that OSCs
need to overcome before entering the photovoltaic market.12

Normally, OSCs are built in two types,
conventional and inverted
structures.13 Inverted organic solar cells
(iOSCs) have a typical device structure consisting of five components:
a cathode electrode (indium tin oxide, ITO), electron transport layers
(ETLs), active layer, hole transport layers (HTLs), and anode electrode
(Ag or Au metal). These architectures are more stable than conventional
structures because of the self-protection from both the cathode and
anode sides.14 In iOSCs, the ETL plays
a crucial role in extracting and transporting photogenerated electrons
from the organic absorber layer to the ITO cathode. The ETL also functions
as a hole-blocking layer and has a large effect on the overall device
performance of iOSCs.15 ETLs in high-performance
iOSCs will ideally form a smooth and compact film on the ITO, have
high transparency, have a suitable conduction band, and provide high
electron mobility.16

In the past,
several kinds of materials such as organic compounds,17 inorganic compounds,18 metallic
salts,19 and others20 have been used as ETLs for enhancing the device
performance of iOSCs. Among these materials, n-type metal oxides such
as TiO2 and ZnO are the two most commonly exploited ETLs
because of their high transmittance of visible light and appropriate
energy band levels.21,22 Unfortunately, the TiO2 ETL suffers from high electron recombination rates because of its
relatively low intrinsic electron mobility (10–5 cm2 V–1 s–1).23 Meanwhile, the ZnO ETL is chemically unstable
and sensitive to weak acids. Both TiO2 and ZnO are unstable
under UV light exposure because of their high photocatalytic activity.24 Typically, TiO2 requires a high temperature
(up to 500 °C) and long (2–5 h) annealing procedure to
convert it into the conductive phase, hindering its use in final iOSC
products, where roll-to-roll industrial processing on flexible substrates
(temperature processing below 200 °C) is employed.25 Furthermore, iOSCs using TiO2 or
ZnO ETLs usually suffer from light-soaking problems; that is, very
poor device performance of these iOSCs is observed in the absence
of UV sources.26,27

Recently, tin oxide (SnO2) has become one of the most
promising candidates for ETLs because of its outstanding properties
such as high transparency, good antireflective properties, suitable
conduction band, and deep valence band level (especially when compared
with the TiO2). SnO2 possesses a large electron
mobility of up to 240 cm2 V–1 s–128 and a wider band gap (3.8 eV),29 which are favorable features for improving device
performance of iOSCs. Unlike TiO2 or ZnO, iOSC devices
using SnO2 were free of light-soaking and showed excellent
device stability.30,31 SnO2 has been intensively
studied as one of the most promising ETLs for the eventual commercialization
of perovskite solar cells (PSCs).32,33 Although high-efficiency
PSCs can be achieved with single SnO2 as an ETL, several
works have also focused on improving the device performance of PSCs
by modifying SnO2 with other organic materials such as
PCBM.34 Composites of SnO2 with
other metal oxides have been made into ETL bilayers such as MgO,35 ZnO,36 and TiO2.37 Other strategies have also
been employed like doping of SnO2 with dopants like Li,38 Sb,39 Nb,40 and Y,41 which greatly
improved device performance of PSCs in comparison to the pristine
SnO2. Zwitterionic compound modification42 or the use of fullerene derivatives anchored to SnO2 have also shown superior performance of PSCs.25 Moreover, it has been reported that SnO2 can also be effectively modified by chemical bath deposition
technique to achieve stable and high performance of PSCs.43 Interestingly, in another aspect, SnO2 can be employed for interfacial modifications of TiO2 to greatly improve the electron extraction and transportation processes
in PSCs, thus highlighting the wide use of SnO2 in applications
for PSCs.44

Like PSCs, interfacial
engineering of ETLs such as ZnO or TiO2 has also drawn
considerable attention from researchers, seeking
to achieve highly efficient and stable iOSCs.45,46 Interfacial modifier layers or buffer layers like organic or inorganic
materials are often inserted between the ETL and the active layer
to facilitate electron extraction and transportation by means of reducing
the work function (WF) of the ETL and decreasing the charge recombination
rates in iOSCs.20 However, to our knowledge,
works on modifying SnO2 or composite SnO2 with
other materials in ETL applications for iOSCs are very limited. We
note here that modifying SnO2 or composites of SnO2 and other materials can work well in PSC systems, but this
might not be transferable to iOSCs because of the differences in material
properties between organic and perovskite (inorganic) solar cells.
This may be the reason behind the limited reports on modifying SnO2 or composites of SnO2 with other materials for
applications in iOSCs. Therefore, modifying SnO2 or forming
composites of SnO2 with other materials in iOSC applications
is of interest.

In our previous reports, we found that ionic
liquids such as 1-benzyl-3-methylimidazolium
chloride ([BzMIM]Cl)47 or alkali carbonates
(Li2CO3, K2CO3, and Rb2CO3)48 can be used as
interfacial modifiers for SnO2 in a facile low-temperature
solution process to provide greatly improved PCEs. Shen et al. reported
that a poly (9,9-n-dihexyl-2,7-fluorene-alt-9-phenyl-3,6-carbazole) (PFN) can also be used to modify SnO2 to obtain great improvements in device performances for iOSCs.49 Other strategies such as doping of SnO2 with metals (such as Mg) has also been pursued by Huang et al. In
their report, Mg-doped SnO2 was obtained by adding magnesium
chloride into SnO2 precursor solutions.50 Huang et al. demonstrated that the Mg:SnO2 interfacial
layers showed great improvements in the electron extraction and reduced
photogenerated carrier recombination rates for iOSCs compared to the
undoped SnO2. Apart from these potential interfacial modifier
materials for SnO2, we report here that zwitterion nondetergent
sulfobetaine like 3-(4-tert-butyl-1-pyridinio)-1-propanesulfonate
(NDSB-256-4T) can also be exploited as a very promising material to
modify SnO2 to achieve highly efficient and stable iOSCs.
Nondetergent sulfobetaine (NDSB-256-4T) can simply be prepared by
dissolving it in methanol followed by spin-coating the solution onto
SnO2 ETLs. Noticeably, NDSB-256-4T can play several important
roles in the modification of SnO2 ETL: (1) it reduces the
WF of SnO2, which results in better energy band alignment
between SnO2 and the active layer to allow for more efficient
electron extraction and transportation to the cathode; (2) it suppresses
charge recombination rates in iOSCs by effectively passivating oxygen
vacancy-related defects in SnO2 that occur during low-temperature
solution synthesis processes, thus significantly enhancing device
performance for iOSCs; (3) it pulls more electrons from the active
layer to the ETL/active interface, upgrading the electron transport
capacity; and (4) it builds a better interfacial contact between SnO2 and the active layer, reducing the electron transport/transfer
resistance and thus greatly improving the efficiency and stability
of iOSC devices. P3HT:PC60BM-based iOSCs using SnO2/NDSB-256-4T (0.2 mg/mL) as an ETL achieved both a higher
average PCE of 3.72%, which is 33% higher than devices using SnO2 only (2.79%) and revealed excellent device stability. More
importantly, we also obtained an impressive average PCE of 8.22% with
SnO2/NDSB-256-4T (0.2 mg/mL) as the ETL in a further application
of the PTB7-Th:PC70BM systems, while the devices based
on SnO2 exhibited an average PCE of just 4.45%. At this
point, we believe that the use of NDSB-256-4T to modify SnO2 ETLs can serve as a good strategy for building commercial high-performance
and highly stable iOSCs.

2 Results and Discussion
The optical properties of SnO2 and SnO2/NDSB-256-4T
ETLs play an important role in the device performance of iOSCs. Therefore,
we first investigated the transmittance and UV-absorption for our
ETL samples coated on glass substrates. Figure 1a shows the transmittance spectra of SnO2 and SnO2/NDSB-256-4T ETL samples, while their
UV–vis absorption is presented in Figure S1 (Supporting Information). Ideally, the transmittance of ETL
should be over 85% in the visible region (380–780 nm) to guarantee
that the maximum sunlight is absorbed by the active layer.51 It appears that both SnO2 and SnO2/NDSB-256-4T ETL samples exhibited an average transmittance
of over 94% in the visible region (380–780 nm), highlighting
the outstanding optical properties of our ETLs. Compared to the SnO2, the SnO2/NDSB-256-4T ETL sample showed a slightly
enhanced transmittance because of antireflection. It has been noted
that the interference from the glass substrate can be eliminated because
we have used the bare glass substrate as a reference during baseline
measurement. As presented in Figure 1a, it is clear that the transmittance of the bare glass
substrate is ca. 100% in the visible region (380–780 nm), indicating
that there is no interference from the glass substrate in our transmittance
measurements for SnO2 and SnO2/NDSB-256-4T ETL
samples. Figure 1b
demonstrates the Tauc plots of SnO2 and SnO2/NDSB-256-4T ETL samples, as extracted from their UV–vis absorption
on glass substrates (Figure S1). As displayed
in Figure 1b, the optical
band gaps of the SnO2 and SnO2/NDSB-256-4T ETL
samples were found to be 3.80 and 3.84 eV, respectively.

(b) (αhν)2 vs photon energy,
(c) room-temperature PL studies, and (d) XRD of
SnO2 and SnO2/NDSB-256-4T films deposited on
glass substrates.

The photoluminescence
(PL) spectroscopy measurements of SnO2 and SnO2/NDSB-256-4T ETL films coated on glass
substrates are shown in Figure 1c using a wavelength excitation of 350 nm. Both the optical
band gaps of SnO2 (3.80 eV) and SnO2/NDSB-256-4T
(3.84 eV) were larger than the excitation energy (3.54 eV). Thus,
any PL emission peaks were attributed to defects in our samples. As
can be seen from Figure 1c, there are three clear emission peaks for the SnO2 and
SnO2/NDSB-256-4T samples. All three clear emission peaks
likely stemmed from oxygen vacancy-related defects in the SnO2 and SnO2/NDSB-256-4T samples.52 Note that a lower PL intensity means fewer defects, and
fewer defects in the ETL mean a lower charge recombination rate for
iOSC devices.53 Compared to SnO2, the SnO2/NDSB-256-4T sample showed strong PL quenching
over a wide region (300–900 nm), suggesting that it effectively
passivated defects in SnO2 with NDSB-256-4T.

We continued
analyzing the structural properties of SnO2 and SnO2/NDSB-256-4T ETL samples via X-ray diffraction
(XRD) measurements. The XRD spectra of the SnO2 and SnO2/NDSB-256-4T samples are presented in Figure 1d. In comparison with JCPDS card no. 41-1445,
it is clear that no principal peaks among the SnO2 and
SnO2/NDSB-256-4T samples can be detected, implying that
our ETL samples had amorphous structure states because of low-temperature
annealing, as reported by other groups.30,31,54

To understand the chemical states of our SnO2 and SnO2/NDSB-256-4T ETL samples, we further investigated
our ETL
samples using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Figure 2a presents the XPS surveys
of our ETL samples, while XPS spectra for the Sn 3d and O 1s regions
are given in Figure 2b,c, respectively. It is clear from Figure 2a that the XPS survey profile of the SnO2/NDSB-256-4T ETL sample contains S, C, and N peaks, suggesting
the existence of NDSB-256-4T (C12H19NO3S) on the SnO2. Figure 2b indicates the presence of Sn 3d5/2 and
Sn 3d3/2 in the SnO2 sample, as represented
by the dominant peaks at 486.92 and 495.34 eV, respectively.55 Compared to SnO2, there are slight
shifts in the Sn 3d5/2 and Sn 3d3/2 binding
energies at 486.17 and 494.58 eV, respectively, for the SnO2/NDSB-256-4T samples, suggesting that there might be a chemical bond
between the NDSB-256-4T and the SnO2.55 Because of the presence of O– of the
electronegative anions (SO32–) of NDSB-256-4T
(C12H19NO3S) on the SnO2 surface, the O–Sn–O stretch, Sn–O vibration,
and O–O stretching vibration in the SnO2 might occur,
resulting in the peak shift in our XPS results as well documented
in several previous reports.42,55,56Figure 2c indicates
a small shift in the O 1s dominant peak binding energy of SnO2/NDSB-256-4T (530.08 eV) to a lower binding energy compared
to SnO2 (530.68 eV). In the SnO2 only ETL, the
atomic percentages of Sn and O were 36.85 and 63.15%, respectively.
Meanwhile, the SnO2/NDSB-256-4T sample had atomic percentages
of 19.45, 40.12, 34.71, 3.17, and 2.55% for Sn, O, C, N, and S, respectively.
The XPS results reconfirmed significant amounts of C, N, and S elements
in NDSB-256-4T (C12H19NO3S) on SnO2. Notably, a large reduction in the atomic percentage of O
(40.12%) was observed for SnO2/NDSB-256-4T compared to
the SnO2 ETL only (63.15%), suggesting successful passivation
of oxygen vacancy-related defects in SnO2 with the NDSB-256-4T
modifier. Figure 2d–f
demonstrates the coexistences of C 1s, N 1s, and S 2p in the SnO2/NDSB-256-4T ETL sample. Figure 2e clearly indicates the presence of two distinguishable
peaks related to the nitrogen atoms. One peak (N1) was located at
a binding energy of 401.64 eV, which typically originates from protonated
nitrogen (NH3+).57 Another peak (N2) at 399.69 eV is ascribed to nonprotonated nitrogen
(amide groups).57 The XPS results have
again confirmed the surface composition as well as chemical states
for our ETL samples.

and (f) S 2p
of SnO2/NDSB-256-4T samples.

Next, we studied the morphology of bare ITO, SnO2, and
SnO2/NDSB-256-4T ETLs deposited on ITO. Top-view scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) images
of bare ITO and our ETL samples coated on ITO substrates are presented
in Figure 3. It is
clear that the morphologies of our ETL samples were quite different
from that of bare ITO. Noticeably, ETL samples presented a very uniform,
fully covered, and compact surface of SnO2 and SnO2/NDSB-256-4T layers on ITO substrates (Figure 3b,c). Note that better ETL morphologies will
help to form good contact between the ETLs and active layers, as well
as help accelerate the electron extraction and transportation processes
from the active to the ETL, thus enhancing the overall device performance
for iOSCs.58 The cross-sectional SEM images
of SnO2 and SnO2/NDSB-256-4T films coated on
ITO substrates are given in Figure S2.
Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra and elemental mapping analysis
for our ETL samples demonstrate good distributions and coexistence
of SnO2 and SnO2/NDSB-256-4T ETLs on ITO substrates,
as shown in Figures S3 and S4, respectively.
As can be clearly seen from Figure S4,
the elements C, N, O, S, and Sn of the SnO2/NDSB-256-4T
(C12H19NO3S) samples are uniformly
distributed on ITO substrates. Note that H is not detectable using
normal EDX because of the very low energy of its characteristic radiation.
SEM images (Figure 3b,c) showed that there is not much difference in morphology between
the SnO2 and SnO2/NDSB-256-4T. However, a careful
observer may see that the SnO2/NDSB-256-4T sample seems
to have a very thin and smooth NDSB-256-4T layer on SnO2 compared to the SnO2-only sample (Figure 3b,c).

Figure 3 Top-view SEM and AFM images of (a,d) bare
ITO, (b,e) SnO2, and (c,f) SnO2/NDSB-256-4T
ETL samples.

The AFM height images (2 μm
× 2 μm) of bare ITO,
SnO2 and SnO2/NDSB-256-4T samples are presented
in Figure 3d–f,
while the corresponding 3D AFM images are given in Figure S5a–c, respectively. The root mean square values
of the roughness (Rq) for the bare ITO,
SnO2, and SnO2/NDSB-256-4T samples as displayed
in Figure 3d–f
are 1.56, 0.837, and 0.761 nm, respectively. Obviously, both the SnO2 and SnO2/NDSB-256-4T samples revealed lower surface Rq values than bare ITO, demonstrating the excellent
morphologies of our ETL samples. Interestingly, the SnO2/NDSB-256-4T sample exhibited slightly lower surface roughness compared
to SnO2, suggesting a smoother surface for SnO2/NDSB-256-4T than for SnO2. Note that the smoother surface
of ETLs suggests reduced defects, and thus lower recombination rates,
a higher current density, and a high fill factor (FF) for iOSCs. We
have also further conducted the AFM measurements for ITO, SnO2, and SnO2/NDSB-256-4T samples at a larger area
(10 μm × 10 μm); and the results are presented in Figure S6. The Rq values of the bare ITO, SnO2, and SnO2/NDSB-256-4T
samples at larger area (10 μm × 10 μm) are found
to be 1.62, 1.56, and 1.31 nm, respectively. Obviously, the Rq values of ITO and ETL samples at a larger
area (10 μm × 10 μm) are increased as compared to
that at a small area size (2 μm × 2 μm) because of
some small islands at a larger area on the ETL samples (Figure S6). However, our Rq values at a larger area are still low as compared with other
reports,40 thus demonstrating the excellent
morphologies of our ETL samples.

The energy band alignment between
each layer of material is considered
to be an important factor in the device performance of iOSCs.59 To understand the important role of energy band
alignment of our ETL samples, we used ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy
(UPS) to determine the valence band maximum (EVBM) energies for SnO2 and SnO2/NDSB-256-4T. Figure 4a–c presents
the UPS survey profiles, valence-band regions (Eonset), and secondary electron cutoffs (Ecutoff) of the SnO2 and SnO2/NDSB-256-4T
samples, respectively. Based on the valence-band regions (Eonset) and secondary electron cutoff (Ecutoff) values, the valence band maximum (EVBM) values were −8.22 and −7.55
eV for SnO2 and SnO2/NDSB-256-4T ETLs, respectively.
The conduction band minimum levels (ECBM) of the SnO2 and SnO2/NDSB-256-4T ETLs were
computed using the energy band gap (Eg) (Figure 1b) and
the valence band maximum (EVBM) values.
Conduction band minimum energy levels (ECBM) of the SnO2 and SnO2/NDSB-256-4T ETLs were
found to be −4.42 and −3.71 eV, respectively. The WF
of the cathode can be calculated using the secondary electron cutoff
(Ecutoff) values and the incident photo
energy hν = 21.22 eV from a He(I) UPS measurement
source.60 In general, the WF of the cathode
can be used in understanding the open open-circuit voltage (Voc) and the electron transport properties of
ETLs in iOSCs.61 The WFs of the SnO2 and SnO2/NDSB-256-4T ETLs were calculated to be
4.42 and 3.85 eV, respectively. It is clear that the WF of SnO2/NDSB-256-4T shifted significantly compared to the SnO2. Thus, iOSCs using SnO2/NDSB-256-4T as ETLs could
allow more efficient electron collection to the cathode, and a higher Voc is expected.

(Eonset), and (c) secondary electron cutoffs
(Ecutoff) of SnO2 and SnO2/NDSB-256-4T
films deposited on ITO glass substrates. (d) Device structure, (e)
energy-level diagram of each layer, and (f) cross-sectional SEM images
of the iOSC device using SnO2/NDSB-256-4T ETLs.

Figure 4d
illustrates
the device structure of our iOSC devices using SnO2 or
SnO2/NDSB-256-4T as ETLs, while the corresponding energy
level diagram of each component is presented in Figure 4e. Compared to SnO2, the conduction
band minimum (ECBM) of the SnO2/NDSB-256-4T sample was significantly shifted (−3.71 eV).
This value is very close to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital
of PC60BM (−3.70 eV). Because there is no energy
offset between the SnO2/NDSB-256-4T ETL and the active
layer, photogenerated electrons can be extracted and transferred easily
from the active layer to the ITO cathode, resulting in a higher efficiency
for iOSCs. The cross-sectional SEM image of a complete iOSC device
using SnO2/NDSB-256-4T ETL is given in Figure 4f. The thickness of the SnO2/NDSB-256-4T ETL was about 30 nm, as can be clearly seen in Figure 4f. Note that the
cross-sectional SEM image of a complete iOSC device using SnO2 as the ETL is shown in Figure S7.

We fabricated P3HT:PC60BM-based standard solar
cell
devices using SnO2 and SnO2/NDSB-256-4T as ETLs
to investigate the effect of NDSB-256-4T interface modification of
the SnO2 ETL on the device performance of iOSCs. We optimized
the photovoltaic device performance of iOSCs with different NDSB-256-4T
concentrations (0, 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 mg/mL) based on the current density–voltage
(J–V) curves, as displayed
in Figure 5a. The dark
current and external quantum efficiency (EQE) are presented in Figure S8a,b, respectively. The detailed photovoltaic
parameters of each of these iOSCs are summarized in Tables S1–S4. As summarized in Table 1, the P3HT:PC60BM-based iOSCs
using SnO2/NDSB-256-4T (0 mg/mL) exhibited an average PCE
recorded over 10 devices of 2.72 ± 0.11%, with a short-circuit
current density (Jsc), an open-circuit
voltage (Voc), and a FF of 10.20 ±
0.10 mA cm–2, 0.55 ± 0.008 V, and 48.24 ±
1.18%, respectively. Interestingly, the SnO2/NDSB-256-4T
samples exhibited excellent performance for iOSC devices up to 0.2
mg/mL concentrations. The device performance of iOSCs started to decrease
slightly at a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL, after which the performance
was greatly decreased for higher concentrations of NDSB-256-4T (e.g.,
0.8 mg/mL). We achieved the average highest photovoltaic device performance
(PCE) with high Jsc, Voc, and FF values when an NDSB-256-4T concentration of
0.2 mg/mL was used. The average photovoltaic performance based on
10 devices included a PCE of 3.72 ± 0.04% with Jsc, Voc, and FF values of
10.64 ± 0.14 mA cm–2, 0.60 ± 0.003 V,
and 57.90 ± 1.31%, respectively, for the NDSB-256-4T concentration
of 0.2 mg/mL. However, a further increase in NDSB-256-4T concentration
to 0.5 and 0.8 mg/mL led to reductions in PCE values of 3.56 ±
0.05 and 3.10 ± 0.22%, respectively.

To demonstrate the good device
performance of iOSCs based on SnO2 and SnO2 with
different concentrations of NDSB-256-4T
as ETLs, we also fabricated iOSC devices using bare ITO, NDSB-256-4T
(0.2 mg/mL), and SnO2 only as ETLs. The detailed photovoltaic
parameters of each of these iOSC devices are given in Tables S5–S7. Figure 5b–d presents the current density–voltage
(J–V) curves, the dark current,
and EQE of iOSCs using bare ITO, NDSB-256-4T (0.2 mg/mL), SnO2 only, and SnO2/NDSB-256-4T (0.2 mg/mL) as ETLs
for a clear comparison. As summarized in Table 1, it appears that the average PCEs of the
devices based on bare ITO, NDSB-256-4T (0.2 mg/mL), SnO2 only, and SnO2/NDSB-256-4T (0.2 mg/mL) as ETLs were 0.74,
2.16, 2.79, and 3.72%, respectively. These results indicate the prominent
role of the electron transport properties of SnO2 and SnO2/NDSB-256-4T (0.2 mg/mL) compared to the bare ITO or the NDSB-256-4T
(0.2 mg/mL) only.

Electron-only devices are one of the most
effective ways to measure
the electron-transport properties of the ETLs in OSC devices.62 Understanding this important aspect, we have
also fabricated electron-only devices with a structure of ITO/ETLs/P3HT:PC60BM/LiF/Al to evaluate the electron mobility (μe) when SnO2 or SnO2/NDSB-256-4T (0.2
mg/mL) was used as ETLs. These electron-only devices were measured
in the dark with a Keithley 2400 source to obtain the current density–voltage
(J–V) characteristics. Figure 6a,b provides the
current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics and the linear fits for the J0.5–V of the electron-only devices
using SnO2 and SnO2/NDSB-256-4T (0.2 mg/mL)
ETLs, respectively. Following the Mott–Gurney law, which is
better known as space charge-limited current (SCLC) theory, we can
compute the electron mobility (μe) of these electron-only
devices based on the Mott–Gurney expression as62,63  Here, JSCLC, V, and L are the current density (J), the applied voltage (V), and the thickness
of the active layer (P3HT:PC60BM) of the electron-only
devices, respectively; ε0 is the permittivity of
free space constant, which has a value of 8.854 × 10–12 C V–1 m–1; and εr is the relative dielectric constant of the P3HT:PC60BM
(active layer), which usually has a value between 3 and 4 and is typically
assumed to be 3.5 as in previous reports.63,64 After the calculation, the electron mobility values (μe) of the devices using SnO2 and SnO2/NDSB-256-4T (0.2 mg/mL) ETLs were found to be 3.61 × 10–4, and 1.53 × 10–3 cm2 V–1 s–1, respectively. Strikingly,
the electron mobility (μe) of the SnO2/NDSB-256-4T (0.2 mg/mL) ETLs was more than four times higher than
the devices based on SnO2 only, highlighting the excellent
electron-transport properties of devices using SnO2/NDSB-256-4T
(0.2 mg/mL) as an ETL. Our electron-only device studies provide convincing
evidence of the enhanced photovoltaic performance of iOSC devices
with SnO2/NDSB-256-4T (0.2 mg/mL) as ETLs.

ETLs, measured in the dark. (c) Room-temperature PL studies of the

iOSCs using SnO2 and SnO2/NDSB-256-4T (0.2 mg/mL)
ETLs, measured in the dark with Vbias =
0 V.

To confirm the impact of NDSB-256-4T
modification on SnO2 ETLs with regard to the charge extraction
and recombination, we
also studied the PL of the glass/SnO2/P3HT:PC60BM and glass/SnO2/NDSB-256-4T (0.2 mg/mL)/P3HT:PC60BM samples. As displayed in Figure 6c, the glass/SnO2/NDSB-256-4T
(0.2 mg/mL)/P3HT:PC60BM sample exhibited significant PL
quenching compared to the glass/SnO2/P3HT:PC60BM. This suggests greatly reduced recombination rates of electrons
and holes and enhanced electron extraction and transportation ability.
The reason for this PL quenching likely originated from successful
passivation of surface trap states in glass/SnO2/P3HT:PC60BM with the presence of NDSB-256-4T modification, significantly
reducing the oxygen vacancy-related defects in SnO2. Therefore,
the PL results again confirmed the enhancements in device performance
of iOSCs using NDSB-256-4T (0.2 mg/mL)-modified SnO2 ETL.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was also studied to
investigate the charge transport behaviors at the interface between
the ETL and the active layer of iOSC devices.65−67 In general,
the interpretation of the impedance spectra (IS) is directly related
to the applied bias voltage for the iOSC devices.66 When one conduct IS measurements at the open-circuit, the
photovoltaic device will mainly work under recombination conditions.
In this case, the IS is usually characterized by a major RC arc along
with additional minor features at high frequency.66 The high-frequency part of the spectra (minor RC arc) may
provide information of intrinsic series resistances in iOSC devices,
while the low frequency arc (major RC arc) is ascribed to recombination
in the active layer.66 This typical IS
can be found in previous reports.43,68 Because the
recombination resistance increases exponentially as the applied voltage
decreases, therefore, at low applied voltages, the IS response becomes
represented for the intrinsic series resistances in iOSC devices in
the equivalent circuit like the sheet resistance (RS) and the charge transfer resistance (RCT), which are effectively voltage independent rather
than for the recombination resistance.66,69 Note that
the charge transfer resistance at the low voltage can also be used
as the useful source for understanding the recombination resistance
in the photoactive blend: low charge transfer resistance might suggest
that higher recombination resistance in the photoactive blend and
vice versa. For IS measurements conducted in the dark with an applied
voltage V = 0, the response is usually characterized
by only one RC arc that contains information for transport and series
resistance elements as in several previous reports.65,67,70 In our iOSCs, we have used the same photoactive
blend along with the same geometry device except for the ETLs (SnO2 vs SnO2/NDSB-256-4T), thus the RCT resistances (resistance at the active/ETL interface,
and the resistance at the ETL/ITO interface) are crucial important
to evaluate the electron extraction and transport properties of SnO2 and SnO2/NDSB-256-4T. Because we measured IS in
the dark with an applied voltage V = 0, thus our
IS should be represented for intrinsic series resistances of our iOSCs
rather than for the recombination resistance in the photoactive blend,
as well-consisting with several previous reports.65,67,70Figure 6d displays the Nyquist plots for the P3HT:PC60BM-based iOSCs using SnO2 and SnO2/NDSB-256-4T
(0.2 mg/mL) ETLs measured in the dark with Vbias = 0 V. The equivalent circuit for these Nyquist plots
is given in the inset of Figure 6d. The intrinsic series resistances of our iOSCs can
be divided into two components. One is the RS and the other is the RCT, which
consists of the internal resistance of the active layer, the resistance
at the active/ETL interface, and the resistance at the ETL/ITO interface.65,67,70Figure 6d shows that the RCT values for iOSCs using SnO2 and SnO2/NDSB-256-4T
(0.2 mg/mL) ETLs were 1718.60 and 438.04 Ω cm2, respectively.
Obviously, the RCT of the SnO2/NDSB-256-4T (0.2 mg/mL)-based iOSC devices showed a dramatic decrease
down to 438.04 Ω cm2 compared to the SnO2-only devices (1718.60 Ω cm2). This indicates that
NDSB-256-4T-modified SnO2 may result in a reduction in
the active/ETL interface resistances, which consequently accelerates
electron transport/transfer between the active layer and the ETL.
The EIS results also provide compelling evidence that can be used
to explain our iOSC device performance.

Among the three essential
characteristics for any photovoltaic
technology (efficiency, scalability, and stability), obtaining good
stability is one of the most difficult challenges hindering the eventual
commercialization of iOSCs. Considering this, we also studied the
stability of our iOSC devices. The iOSC devices (without any encapsulation)
were kept in ambient conditions, and the photovoltaic performance
was regularly checked over 5 weeks. Figure 7 demonstrates the results of the stability
studies for our iOSC devices, noting that the detailed photovoltaic
parameters of these devices were also recorded and are presented in Tables S8 and S9 for SnO2 and SnO2/NDSB-256-4T (0.2 mg/mL), respectively. Remarkably, the iOSCs
using SnO2/NDSB-256-4T (0.2 mg/mL) showed outstanding long-term
stability with a PCE that remained at over 98% of its initial values
after 5 weeks. The inverted device structure, the ultra-stability
of SnO2, and the outstanding interface engineering improvement
between the active layer and the SnO2 with the presence
of the NDSB-256-4T modification equally contributed to the excellent
long-term device stability of our iOSCs.

In a further application of the PTB7-Th:PC70BM systems,
we also obtained impressive enhancements in device performance for
iOSCs using SnO2/NDSB-256-4T (0.2 mg/mL) as the ETL. Figure 8a–c presents
the photovoltaic performance of PTB7-Th:PC70BM-based iOSCs
using SnO2 and SnO2/NDSB-256-4T (0.2, 0.5, and
0.8 mg/mL) ETLs, while the corresponding EIS studies are also given
in Figure 8d. The photovoltaic
parameters are summarized in Table 2, while the detailed photovoltaic parameters for each
of these iOSC devices are provided in Tables S10–13. As shown in Table 2, the average PCEs of the devices with SnO2 and SnO2/NDSB-256-4T (0.2, 0.5 and 0.8 mg/mL) ETLs were 4.45, 8.22,
8.06, and 7.69%, respectively. Compared to the devices based on SnO2 only, the average PCEs of the devices using NDSB-256-4T (0.2,
0.5, and 0.8 mg/mL)-modified SnO2 as ETLs showed dramatic
improvements. This improvement in photovoltaic performance is attributed
to the considerably smaller leakage current (Figure 8b) along with the significantly reduced charge
transfer resistance (RCT) for iOSC devices
using NDSB-256-4T (0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 mg/mL)-modified SnO2 as ETLs.

We have also
studied the stability of the PTB7-Th:PC70BM-based iOSCs
using SnO2 and SnO2/NDSB-256-4T
(0.2 mg/mL) as ETLs. The iOSC devices (without any encapsulation)
were stored in ambient conditions, and the photovoltaic performance
was regularly checked over 4 weeks. The device stability results of
the PTB7-Th:PC70BM-based iOSCs using SnO2 and
SnO2/NDSB-256-4T (0.2 mg/mL) as ETLs are presented in Figure S11; while the detailed photovoltaic parameters
of these devices were also recorded and are gathered in Tables S14 and S15 for SnO2 and SnO2/NDSB-256-4T (0.2 mg/mL) ETLs, respectively. As expected,
the PTB7-Th:PC70BM-based iOSCs using SnO2/NDSB-256-4T
(0.2 mg/mL) ETLs revealed excellent long-term stability with PCE remained
at over 90% after being stored for 4 weeks in ambient conditions.
Again, the high-stability of SnO2 in the inverted device
structure and the excellent interface engineering improvements between
the active layer and the SnO2 with the presence of the
NDSB-256-4T modification are compelling reasons that explain the excellent
long-term device stability of our iOSCs.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we successfully introduced a promising interfacial
engineering strategy to achieve highly efficient and stable iOSCs
using a low-temperature solution-processed zwitterion NDSB-256-4T-modified
SnO2 ETL. We demonstrated that NDSB-256-4T helps both to
reduce the WF and passivate the defects in SnO2. Therefore,
better interfacial contact between SnO2 and the active
layer was built, resulting in a higher PCE and longer device stability
of iOSCs using SnO2/NDSB-256-4T ETL compared to devices
based on SnO2 only. We achieved an average PCE of 3.72%
for the P3HT:PC60BM-based iOSCs using SnO2/NDSB-256-4T
(0.2 mg/mL) as the ETL; this is 33% higher than devices using SnO2 only (2.79%). Our iOSC devices also showed excellent stability,
with 90% of the PCE remaining after storing 5 weeks in ambient air
without encapsulation. In an extended application for the PTB7-Th:PC70BM systems, we also obtained an impressive average PCE of
8.22% with SnO2/NDSB-256-4T (0.2 mg/mL) as the ETL. Devices
based on SnO2 exhibited an average PCE of only 4.45%. We
believe that the use of NDSB-256-4T to modify SnO2 ETL
is an effective way to obtain highly efficient and stable commercial
iOSCs. Finally, we suggest that the SnO2/zwitterion ETL
approach can be applied to other optoelectronic devices such as organic
light-emitting diodes or PSCs, where an ETL is necessary to ensure
good device performance.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials and Reagents
Tin(II) chloride
dihydrate (SnCl2·2H2O, ∼98%) was
received from Alfa Aesar, and ethanol (C2H5OH,
99.9%) was purchased from EMD Millipore. Tin(II) chloride dihydrate
and ethanol were used as precursor and solvent, respectively, to prepare
the SnO2 precursor solution. Methanol (CH3OH,
99.8%) and 3-(4-tert-butyl-1-pyridinio)-1-propanesulfonate
(NDSB-256-4T, 98%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich to prepare the
NDSB-256-4T solution.

The donor polymers included poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl)
(P3HT) and poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-)-2-carboxylate-2-6-diyl] (PTB7-Th), which were
purchased from Rieke Metals, Inc. and Solarmer Energy Inc., respectively.
Both acceptor polymers, PC60BM (phenyl-C60-butyric
acid methyl ester) and PC70BM (phenyl-C70-butyric
acid methyl ester), were obtained from Nano Holding. The ODCB (1,2-dichlorobenzene,
99%) and DIO (1,8-diiodooctane, 98%, contains copper as stabilizer)
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich to prepare the donor–acceptor
blend solution.

4.2 Fabrication of the iOSC
Devices
ITO-glass
substrates (2.5 × 2.5 cm2) with a sheet resistance
of about 12 Ω/square and a thickness of 125 nm were obtained
from the Korea Electronics Technology Institute and were used as cathode
electrodes of iOSC devices. Prior to coating the ETLs, the ITO-glass
substrates were well-cleaned through sequential ultrasonic treatments
with deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol. Low-temperature solution-processed
SnO2 ETLs were prepared according to our previous reports.71 SnCl2·2H2O (1.128
g) was dissolved in 50 mL of absolute ethanol. Then, the resulting
solution was stirred at 80 °C for 8 h to form a uniform solution.
After aging for 1 day, this solution was used to prepare SnO2 ETL (with a thickness of 20–25 nm) via a spin-coating method
(3000 rpm, 40 s) onto either a bare glass or ITO-glass substrates
in air. Then, they were sintered on a hotplate at 185 °C for
1 h. Different concentrations of NDSB-256-4T (0, 0.2, 0.5 and 0.8
mg/mL) were prepared by dissolving 0, 2, 5, and 8 mg of NDSB-256-4T
in four different vials, in which each contained 10 mL methanol. Before
spin-coating, these vials were stirred at room temperature for about
3 h to yield uniform solutions. The deposition of NDSB-256-4T films
(∼8–10 nm) took place inside a N2-filled
glovebox via a spin-coating method at 4000 rpm for 40 s, followed
by drying at 100 °C for 10 min using a hotplate.

The blend
active layers (P3HT:PC60BM) in ODCB (1,2-dichlorobenzene)
with a concentration of 25 mg/mL were spin-coated on ETLs (500 rpm,
40 s) to yield an active thickness of about 180–200 nm. Then,
these freshly coated active samples were kept in closed petri dishes
overnight to allow a gradually
solvent annealing process, as in previous reports.72 Meanwhile, PTB7-Th:PC70BM active layers with
the same thickness of 180–200 nm were obtained by spin-coating
a blended PTB7-Th:PC70BM solution (1:1.5 wt %, 30 mg/mL)
in mixed solvent ODCB/DIO (97:3 vol %) on ETL samples at a speed of
500 rpm for 40 s. PTB7-Th:PC70BM samples were kept in a
vacuum chamber for ∼3 h prior to electrode deposition processes
to completely dry the films and remove the additive (DIO).73 Finally, the iOSC devices were thermally deposited
with a 10 nm MoO3 HTL, followed by a 100 nm Ag anode electrode
through a shadow mask in a high vacuum chamber (less than 1 ×
10–6 Torr). The active area of the iOSC device was
0.11 cm2 as determined using an aperture shadow mask. The
thermal evaporation rates were controlled at 0.1–0.2 and 2–2.5
Å/s for MoO3 and Ag, respectively. For the electron-only
devices, the anode contacts of LiF (0.7 nm) and Al (105 nm) were also
thermally deposited on the active layer (P3HT:PC60BM) via
a shadow mask with controlled thermal evaporation rates of 0.1 and
2–3 Å/s for LiF and Al, respectively.

4.3 Thin-Film Characterization
Shimadzu
UV-2550 spectrophotometer systems were first used to evaluate the
optical properties (UV absorption and transmittance) of SnO2 and SnO2/NDSB-256-4T ETLs on bare glass substrates. The
room-temperature PL spectra of the ETL and the active samples were
achieved under excitation at 350 nm via a Jasco FP-6500 spectrophotometer
system. The XRD and XPS systems were used to obtain the structural
properties and chemical states of SnO2 and SnO2/NDSB-256-4T samples, respectively. The band energy levels of SnO2 and SnO2/NDSB-256-4T samples were investigated
using UPS measurements, with an energy source of 21.22 eV (He I).
Field-emission SEM (FESEM, Zeiss Co., Germany) and AFM with tapping
mode (Bruker, USA) were used to obtain the morphology information
of ETLs. The EDX (energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) of the SEM
system was used to obtain elemental maps of SnO2 and SnO2/NDSB-256-4T samples. The cross-sectional SEM images of SnO2 and SnO2/NDSB-256-4T samples along with the complete
iOSC devices using SnO2 or SnO2/NDSB-256-4T,
as ETLs were also achieved by using the FESEM measurement system (Zeiss
Co., Germany).

4.4 Photovoltaic Characterization
The
photovoltaic device performances of all fabricated iOSCs were tested
under standard illumination (100 mW/cm2 AM 1.5 G) or in
the dark under ambient conditions with the solar cell I–V simulator measurement system using Keithley
2400. For normal photovoltaic characterization, the intensity of the
light illumination was calibrated before the measurements using a
monocrystalline-silicon solar cell (2 × 2 cm2, calibrated
at NREL, Colorado, USA) to set the standard conditions (100 mW/cm2 AM 1.5 G). We scanned all the iOSC devices in the reverse
direction with a scan speed of 0.2 V/s. The delay time was 10 ms;
the scan step was 0.02 V from −1 to 1 V. The electron-only
devices were also characterized using Keithley 2400 with an applied
voltage ranging from 0 to 3 V, measured in the dark. A scan step of
0.05 V at a scan speed of 0.2 V/s and a delay time of 100 ms were
used. EQE was obtained using a Polaronix K3100 spectrometer system.
Finally, the impedance measurements for all the iOSC devices were
performed using a VersaSTAT3 (METEK) tool conducted in the dark with
an applied voltage Vbias = 0 V, and the
frequency was selected between 10 kHz and 0.1 Hz.
