Methyl mercaptan—a harmful
impurity in natural gas—may
be selectively converted into H2S and hydrocarbons [methyl
mercaptan to hydrocarbon (M2TH) process], using zeolite catalysts.
When M2TH is compared with the well-known MTH (methanol to hydrocarbons)
process, significant differences emerge, essentially regarding the
formation and distribution of products. Density functional theory
(DFT) and Born–Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) were employed
to reveal possible origins for the experimentally observed differences.
We established a close similarity between DFT intrinsic (electronic)
reaction profiles in the stepwise mechanism of methanol and mercaptan
dehydration, although no variance in reactivity was revealed. BOMD
simulations at the experimental temperature of 823 K reveal rapid
hydrogen abstraction from the methyl group in mercaptan, adsorbed
in the zeolite cavity in the presence of the methoxy intermediate.
The formation of •CH2SH radical is 10 times faster
than that of •CH2OH at the same temperature. The
varied reactivity of methanol and mercaptan in MTH and M2TH processes,
respectively, can therefore first be attributed to very rapid hydrogen
abstraction in mercaptan, which occurs in the zeolite cavity, following
the formation of surface methoxy.

Introduction
Methyl mercaptan (CH3SH) is
invariably an abundant impurity
in natural gas. For environmental and industrial reasons, its concentration
should be maintained below 5 ppmv; however, CH3SH is one
of the most refractory compounds to resist the gas cleanup process.
Commercial procedures used to remove mercaptan from gas usually require
formulated solvents or include reactions that need additional reagents
that often generate waste. We have recently shown that CH3SH can be selectively transformed into hydrocarbons and H2S over H-zeolite/zeotypes with diverse topologies, for example, H-ZSM-5,
H-Y, H-ferrierite, H-BEA, H-MOR, and H-SAPO-34.1,2 The
H2S produced can be efficiently captured by absorption
using conventional solvents and made commercially saleable by applying
the Claus process. The catalytic transformation of CH3SH
was called M2TH (methyl mercaptan to hydrocarbons) and H-ZSM-5 was
established as the most active and stable zeolite for this process.1

Methyl mercaptan is the sulfur analogue
of methanol (CH3OH), whose conversion to hydrocarbons is
known as methanol to hydrocarbons
(MTH), representing a well-known industrial process.3 To compare M2TH and MTH, the conversion of CH3OH and CH3SH under equivalent conditions was investigated,
using H-ZSM-5 zeolite as the catalyst.4 Although similarities exist between M2TH and MTH, significant differences
were observed, essentially regarding the catalyst lifetime and the
formation of products. In the M2TH process, C1–C3 alkanes (with
>90% of CH4) and benzene, toluene, and xylene (BTX)
aromatics
are the main hydrocarbons formed. Only a very small amount of olefins
can be identified among the products. Similarly, in the few reports/patents
dedicated to the methyl mercaptan conversion over microporous acid
catalysts,5−7 methane appears to be the main product obtained.
In contrast, in the MTH process, products obtained are BTX aromatics
and alkanes, but large amounts of C2–C4 olefins are also obtained.4 In the MTH process, the catalyst also endured
for longer than it did in the M2TH process.

Generally, in the
MTH process, the formation of lower olefins is
assisted by the so-called “dual-cycle hydrocarbon pool”
(HP) mechanism.8−12 Accordingly, the aromatic hydrocarbons and olefins present inside
the pores/cages of zeolites undergo successive methylation steps by
methanol, thus eliminating further olefins (Scheme 1).3,12

Scheme 1 “Dual-Cycle”
Mechanism in the MTH Process (Adapted
from Ref (11))
A similar mechanism has been
proposed to explain the formation
of olefins, when other C1 functionalized molecules, such as methyl
halides (CH3X, X = Cl, Br, I), were converted into hydrocarbons
over zeolites (CH3X → hydrocarbons + HX).13−15 A general consensus opines that methylations represent key reaction
stages in all these processes. Methanol and methyl halides are known
to be efficient methylating agents.16−21 Contrastingly, there is no information in the literature that demonstrates
the capability of methyl mercaptan to methylate aromatics/olefins.
The absence of olefins in the M2TH process suggests that the HP mechanism
(based on methylation steps) is not sustained. Notably, only few theoretical
studies have focused on adsorption22,23 and conversion24 of methyl mercaptan on acid zeolites. The most
representative is the very recent density functional theory (DFT)
study that describes the catalytic CH3SH coupling over
chabazite catalyst to form the C–C bond in ethylene.24

We investigated methylation by methyl
mercaptan over the H-ZSM-5
catalyst for the first time, using Born–Oppenheimer molecular
dynamics (BOMD) in conjunction with methods based on the quantum chemical
DFT, to gain more insights into the mechanism of the zeolite-catalyzed
M2TH process. We compared our results to those obtained from the methylation
reaction with methanol, studied using the same computational methods
and models. This report is organized as follows: first, we describe
the zeolite models and computational methods used, subsequently we
provide an overview of the experimental and theoretical results related
to M2TH and MTH processes, and in the following sections, we present
and discuss the intrinsic potential energy surface (PES) of dehydration
reaction and the BOMD simulation at T = 823 K.

Results
and Discussion
M2TH versus MTH—Overview of the Experimental
Results
The experimental studies related to the comparison
between M2TH
and MTH processes demonstrated that CH3SH can be successfully
converted over protonic zeolites (H-ZSM-5, H-Y, and H-ferrierite),
without adding any reagent.1 Below 673
K, CH3SH is converted at equilibrium into dimethyl sulfide
(DMS) and H2S, and above 773 K, it is selectively converted
into H2S and hydrocarbons (essentially light alkanes and
aromatics) (see Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Methyl Mercaptan Conversion over H-ZSM-5 Zeolite (According
to Ref (1))
The conversion of methanol
over zeolites is known to follow analogous
pathways (see Scheme 3).10,25

Scheme 3 Methanol Conversion over H-ZSM-5 (According
to Ref (25))
In Table 1, we summarize
the results from the experimental conversion of methyl mercaptan and
methanol, investigated under equivalent conditions: 823 K, WHSV =
0.30 h–1 over H-ZSM-5 as the catalyst,4 reporting the percentage of conversion and amount
of products formed during conversion. These results reveal that catalyst
lifetime and product distribution constitute the principal differences
between M2TH and MTH. In the M2TH process, mercaptan conversion remains
at 99% for 8 h, before decreasing smoothly to 75% after 17 h of operation.4 In the case of methanol conversion (the MTH process),
the catalyst exhibits enduring stability. During the first 45 h, methanol
is fully converted into hydrocarbons, mainly lower olefins and aromatics.

In terms of the catalyst’s lifetime, differences are associated
with deactivation rates related to the amount of coke formed in each
process (M2TH produces almost four times more coke than MTH) (Table 1). Concerning product
distribution in the M2TH process, the main hydrocarbons that are produced
are C1–C3 alkanes (with >90% of CH4) and BTX
aromatics.
Only very small amounts of olefins are identified among the products.
Contrastingly, the MTH process produces aromatics, alkanes, and a
large amount of olefins (C2–C4).

According to Scheme 1, light olefins are
mainly formed during the methylation cycle of
aromatics. Recently, many studies have been published discussing aromatic
alkylation with methanol; these are reviewed by Ilias and Bhan.18 Two reaction mechanisms have been recognized:
(i) concerted mechanism, in which methanol and aromatic are coadsorbed
onto a single acid site and then react in a concerted step, and (ii)
stepwise mechanism, in which methanol dehydrates onto an acid site
to form a surface-bound methoxide species, which then methylates aromatics
by applying an Eley–Rideal-type mechanism. Theoretical studies
remain inconclusive concerning which mechanism is preferable.26 Spectral and kinetic experiments indicate that
surface methoxide species are very likely involved as key reactive
intermediates in methanol conversion and methylation processes by
methanol on zeolite catalysts.27−36 Accordingly, aromatic methylation follows a pathway, as depicted
in Scheme 4a, where
a model reaction for the methylation of benzene over H-ZSM-5 zeolite
is presented. The three main steps of this mechanism are as follows:
(i) adsorption of CH3OH on a Brønsted proton; (ii)
dehydration of methanol to form surface-bound methoxy species (−OCH3), and (iii) interaction of the methoxy function with an aromatic
molecule in the mobile phase (adsorbed or not) to form a methylated
hydrocarbon, which then desorbs from the zeolite surface.18 To evaluate the alkylation capability of methyl
mercaptan in this theoretical study, both methanol and methyl mercaptan
were considered to be methylating agents in the stepwise mechanism
of Scheme 4a,b.

Scheme 4 Stepwise Mechanisms for the Methylation of Aromatics on Zeolites
with (a) CH3OH and (b) CH3SH
In these pathways, whereas the adsorption and
dehydration steps
are expected to be specific for each methylating molecule, benzene
methylation with analogous methoxy species should be independent of
the original reactant. Therefore, the present theoretical study at T = 0 K concerns the first two steps of the stepwise mechanism.

Adsorption of CH3OH and CH3SH on H-ZSM-5
Zeolite
In this investigation, we used several H-ZSM-5 models
of different sizes (see Figure 1) to compare the influence of model size on adsorption energies.

Figure 1 Cluster
models of the H-ZSM-5 pore representing 4T and 10T clusters
in the gas phase (1a), embedded 10T cluster in a 99T-zeolite
framework (1b) used for the geometry optimization of
the reagents, intermediates, and transition states (TSs) with a two-layer
ONIOM scheme, and 20T cluster in the gas phase (1c),
used for the BOMD dynamics (see text for more details).

An embedded cluster was considered for the dehydration
reaction,
emulating the previously proposed models in the studies of methylation
by CH3OH over acid H-ZSM-5.17,37,38 The acidic Brønsted site is represented by one
hydrogen atom that is bonded to oxygen at the (Osurf) surface
and next to Al3+. A previous theoretical study revealed
that H-ZSM-5 structures with Al3+ located at 24 different
positions present similar stability.39 Energy
differences cannot be used to distinguish between various Al3+ substitution positions. Therefore, Al3+ location does
not modify conclusions.

The adsorption of both reactants occurs
by means of the H-bond
formation between the zeolite surface hydrogen, Hsurf,
and X atom, as shown in Figure 2. The computed minimum energy adsorbate structures with characteristic
bond lengths are presented in the same figure. As expected, the methanol
adsorbate geometries are characterized by shorter H bonds than the
mercaptan adsorbate structures. The adsorption enthalpies and Gibbs
free energies for the three zeolite models and exchange–correlation
functionals are presented in Table 2.

are given in Å.

in Figure 1.

The absolute values of the adsorption
energies increase by 2–3
to 20 kcal/mol with the model size from 4T to 10T to 109T, depending
on the exchange–correlation functional. M06 leads to a strong
stabilization of mercaptan adsorption compared to Perdew, Burke, and
Ernzerhof (PBE) and B3LYP results; however, in all cases, methanol
adsorbate is more stable than mercaptan adsorbate by ∼6 to
20 kcal/mol. This does not depend either on the theoretical method
or on the model size of the zeolite.

Our ΔE results generally coincide with previous
studies on methanol adsorption.17,37,38,40 The H-bond lengths of CH3OH and CH3SH concur with previous theoretical DFT/BLYP
results,22 reporting 1.52 and 2.25 Å
for the Hsurf···O(CH3OH) and
Hsurf···S(CH3SH) bond lengths,
respectively. The methanol adsorption enthalpies are similar to the
most recent theoretical studies also using the ONIOM quantum mechanics/molecular
mechanics (QM/MM) approach (−24.437 and −27.4 kcal/mol16) and fall
within the range of experimental methanol adsorption energies (−15
to −27 kcal/mol41,42).

The inclusion of thermal
corrections and entropy contributions
at T = 298 K in the smallest H-ZSM-5 cluster, 1a (top), leads to ΔG > 0, which
indicates
that CH3SH is not adsorbed at the surface, represented
by only a few T sites. Similarly, the ΔG value
obtained with B3LYP is positive for mercaptan/10T adsorbate. At T = 823 K, positive ΔG is found.
Gibbs free energies of adsorption are not computed in the case of
the 109T cluster because DFT vibrational frequency analysis is very
demanding for this large size model. The differences between ΔE and ΔG values in Table 2 for both 4T and 10T structures
at T = 298 K are ∼10–15 and ∼20–35
kcal/mol at T = 823 K, respectively, irrespective
of the functional and model size.

Positive Gibbs free energy
of adsorption indicates spontaneous
desorption. Consequently, the adsorption reaction is not favored thermodynamically.
This contradicts experimental studies that report the adsorption of
methanol and methyl mercaptan on H-ZSM-5 at temperatures higher than 773 K.4 It is worth noting that the thermal corrections and entropy are
computed in the approximation of the ideal polyatomic gas43 from the vibrational frequencies. During the
last two decades, various scaling factors were proposed to correct
DFT vibrational frequencies and the posteriori-derived thermodynamics
quantities.44 However, our calculations
revealed large positive free energies of adsorption at T = 823 K that cannot be corrected by scaling. This suggests that
the approximation of the ideal polyatomic gas,43 used in the calculations of ΔG,
fails to reproduce the experimental data for the systems and temperatures
considered. Therefore, in the following, we only compare the electronic
PES for both reactants with the energy barriers computed from the
electronic total energies (vide infra) at T = 0 K,
usually referred to as “intrinsic” reaction barriers.39

Dehydration of Methanol and Mercaptan over
H-ZSM-5
Previous theoretical studies concluded that the dehydration
of methanol
is an endothermic reaction with an energy barrier of ∼40 kcal/mol.37,38,45 We studied this using the 10/99T
ONIOM model in Figure 1, as described in the “Models and Computational
Details” section. The methanol transition-state (TS)
structure obtained, shown in Figure 3a, closely resembles the previously described TS complex.37,38 The TS complex in the mercaptan dehydration reaction, shown in Figure 3b, is characterized
by a longer C–S separation compared to the C–O distance
in Figure 3a. The H
bonds formed with Osurf in the mercaptan TS are also longer
than in the methanol TS structure. Similar geometric differences can
be observed in the methoxy intermediate and adsorbed H2O and H2S geometries, presented in Figure 3c,d.

In Figure 4, we
present the PBE, B3LYP, and M06 intrinsic PES. The energy barriers,
the formation energies of the methoxy intermediate (Int_Met···H2O), and the H2X desorption are reported in Table 3. For methanol dehydration,
the energy barriers to Int_Met···H2O are
24.6 (PBE), 22.8 (B3LYP), and 34.8 (M06) kcal/mol. These values are
smaller than the ∼40 kcal/mol intrinsic energy barrier reported
previously.37,38,45 We also localized TS structures with higher barriers (of ∼50
kcal/mol) and less stable methoxy intermediates, with H2X close to the opposite site of Al3+ that forms H bonds
with Osurf of −Si–O–Si– groups.
These higher-energy TS geometries are shown in Figure 5. Apparently, PES has several local minima
and maxima, with structures that differ mainly in the H2X orientation and in the positions at the zeolite cavity. These small
differences in TS geometries can yield TS energies that differ by
several tenths of kcal/mol.

A more significant
result is that the energy barriers to the methoxy
intermediate, Int_Met···H2X, are very comparable
using PBE and B3LYP functionals. In the reaction of mercaptan and
methoxy intermediate, the barrier is higher by only 1.5–1.8
kcal/mol. On the contrary, the M06 functional gives an 8 kcal/mol
smaller TS barrier for mercaptan versus methanol dehydration (see
ΔETS values in Table 3).

The formation energies
of Int_Met···H2X (Table 3) obtained
from the equation  are similar for both reagents,
except with the M06 functional that reveals a nearly two times smaller
ΔEform for the CH3SH
reagent, which follows from the enhanced M06 adsorption of mercaptan.
After H2O/H2S desorption, the relative energy
of surface methoxy resulting from the reaction with mercaptan was
smaller by 5–6 kcal/mol than that formed from the methanol
reagent (see Figure 4). Our computed relative energies of Int_Met···H2O and that of surface methoxy are more negative by 5–7
kcal/mol than the previous B3LYP results.38 We attribute this difference to slightly different geometrical parameters.

Although the relative energies of the adsorbate, intermediate,
and products at the PES of mercaptan to the surface methoxy reaction
are higher than those for the methanol reactant, the intrinsic TS
barriers are very similar and even smaller for mercaptan as found
with the M06 functional. This suggests that the formation of stable
surface methoxy following Scheme 4 is energetically favored, immaterial of the use of
methanol or methyl mercaptan reagents. Our conclusion corroborates
the similarities obtained between the reaction pathways of methanol
and mercaptan dehydration in chabazite,24 which demonstrates that the DFT approaches and models implemented
have little impact on the comparison of methanol/mercaptan reaction
pathways, despite some differences in the numerical values of the
energies. Moreover, the concerted mechanism and formation of C–C
bonds for both CH3XH reagents were shown to be very similar
in chabazite from the static DFT reaction barriers. Therefore, we
did not attempt computations of intrinsic reaction pathways for the
other possible reaction mechanisms in H-ZSM-5 models because we did
not anticipate any significant difference of the intrinsic energy
barriers that could be useful to answer the questions of the origins
for the observed very different reaction mechanisms of both reagents.

Computational results also concur with the experiments reported
for both reactants concerning the formation of CH3XCH3 and H2X desorption but at different temperatures,
as shown in Scheme 2.2,4 For the reaction with methyl mercaptan reagent to
continue, an increase in temperature of up to 823 K was necessary.4 A detailed explanation of mercaptan conversion
at this temperature is still lacking. As mentioned previously, correction
of the intrinsic PES at T = 823 K by the thermodynamic
quantities evaluated in the ideal polyatomic gas approximation posteriori
to the DFT electronic structure calculations at T = 0 K produced unrealistic positive adsorption energies and appeared
inappropriate for methanol/mercaptan adsorption at high temperatures.
We therefore used BOMD to account for the effect of fast rotational
and vibrational motions at the experimental temperature.

BOMD Simulations
BOMD simulations at T = 823 K were carried out
on models of adsorbed methanol/mercaptan
in the H-ZSM-5 cavity, as well as on structures containing surface
methoxy and one CH3XH molecule in the cavity. The former
model is used to estimate the temperature effect on the adsorption
process, which is the first step of the reaction, whereas the latter
structure is used to model the reaction between surface methoxy and
CH3XH. According to the experimental study,4 at temperatures <773 K, the only products are CH3SCH3 and H2S (see Scheme 2). Only after increasing the temperature
to above 773 K and setting it to T = 823 K in the
experiments did we observe total conversion of methyl mercaptan to
alkanes, BTX, and H2S. As the intrinsic TS energy barrier
(Figure 4) presents
no obstacle for the mercaptan dehydration of surface methoxy, we explicitly
considered the rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom along
BOMD simulations. The latter are expected to provide initial information
about the effect of temperature on the structural evolutions of the
reagents in the zeolite cavity. The zeolite model in question is the
20T cluster in Figure 1c, and details of the dynamic simulations are provided in the “Models and Computational Details” section.

First, considering the dynamics of CH3XH reagents at T = 823 K, prior to the formation of surface methoxy, we
found that both molecules adsorb at the zeolite surface via the formation
and deformation of hydrogen bond(s). In the left panels in Figure 6a,b, we present the
evolution of characteristic structural parameters, such as Hsurf···O(CH3OH); Osurf···H(HX−);
and X–H, X–C, and C–H bond lengths. Methanol
forms the shortest H bond with its oxygen and the zeolite hydrogen
at the Brønsted site. This bond length oscillates between 1.5
and 2.3 Å. Dynamic H bond(s) with surface oxygen(s) are also
formed. The shortest Osurf···H(HO−)
is shown in Figure 6a, left panel. Mercaptan predominantly rotates between two surface
oxygens, labeled as a and b in Figure 6b (left panel) and indicated on the 20T zeolite structure
in Figure 6c. Most
of the time, these two dynamic H bonds vary within an interval of
2.0–3.0 Å (Figure 6b, left). Mercaptan H (HS−) tends to dissociate as
indicated by the elongation of the S–H bond; however, for the
considered simulation time, mercaptan remains intact with the S–H
length oscillating between 1.20 and 1.75 Å. The optimized bond
length at T = 0 K S–H of the adsorbed mercaptan
in the ONIOM 10T/99T structure is 1.36 Å. Contrastingly, the
methanol O–H distance remains very close to its optimized value
of 0.99 Å. Likewise, the average bond lengths for C–O
and C–S over all the snapshots are 1.51 and 1.90 Å, respectively.
These values resemble the optimized respective bond distances of 1.44
Å (C–O) and 1.84 Å (C–S). The C–H distance
oscillations in the range of 0.9–1.3 Å are obtained for
both mercaptan and methanol along the dynamics. This analysis suggests
that initially both adsorbed molecules remain intact and undergo similar
structural evolution, although subsequently some differences emerge
(see Figure 6a,b, left
panels).

the BOMD simulations of the 20T zeolite model with adsorbed (a) methanol

the right of the arrow) structures of CH3SH and surface
methoxy. The oxygen atoms, labeled as a and b in the right panel,
are those that form H bonds with the mercaptan hydrogen.

This also corroborates experimental findings, which
indicate that
the adsorption on the zeolite catalysts represents a first methylation
step on the reaction pathway of methanol and mercaptan (Scheme 4) at T = 823
K.

The presence of surface methoxy and CH3XH in the
zeolite
cavity conducted to different dynamics of CH3OH and CH3SH. A very fast dissociation of one methyl hydrogen occurred
in mercaptan, producing a •CH2SH radical. The dissociation
occurred after 83 fs simulation time and energy convergence was broken
once the methyl hydrogen had dissociated because of the presence of
the nonbonded abstracted H atom. The important bond distances in the
initial and final snapshot structure are reported in Figure 6c. The C–H and X–C
bond evolution along the dynamics are presented in the right panels
in Figure 6a,b. The
C–X bond length variations remain similar to the isolated adsorbed
molecules in the cavity. Elongation of one C–H distance ≥1.34
Å causes hydrogen abstraction. A similar effect of hydrogen abstraction
from the methyl group in CH3OH is established when CH3OH is adsorbed in the presence of surface methoxy, but this
process is roughly 10 times slower than the H dissociation from the
coadsorbed methyl mercaptan molecule.

To verify the BOMD results,
we repeated the simulations of mercaptan
and surface methoxy in the 20T zeolite cluster with larger bases,
TZVP, and without constraining the cluster geometry. The •CH2SH radical is again obtained after a somewhat longer simulation
time of 210 fs. Therefore, larger bases would systematically slow
down the processes but with no effect on the resulting trends.

Rapid formation of •CH2SH radical from mercaptan
in a water solvent was reported previously in electron spin resonance
studies.46 This process was explained with
reference to the constraint of free methyl rotation around the C–S
bond by the hydrogen bonds between mercaptan and the oxygen of H2O. Hindered rotation was thought to induce a nonequivalent
orbital coupling between the atomic orbitals of carbon and the three
hydrogen atoms in the CH3 group. This promotes coupling
between only one or two C–H atoms and causes very rapid dissociation
from −CH3 on the part of the remaining hydrogen.47 The latter process is known as hydrogen abstraction.
An analogous mechanism has beeen suggested for the formation of CH3S• and •CH3 radicals.
Similar to mercaptan in water solvent, C–S rotation is hindered
in the zeolite cavity because of the formation of hydrogen bonds between
the methyl H···Osurf and H (HS)···Osurf (see Figure 6c). In the initial geometry of the coadsorbed CH3SH molecule,
the three C–H distances are identical, equal to 1.09 Å.
In the final snapshot structure in Figure 6c with the •CH2SH radical,
to the right of the arrow, one C–H distance is shorter, 1.03
Å, and the other two are 1.15 and 1.34 Å. The C–H
bonds oscillate between comparable values in the isolated adsorbed
molecules (inset in the left panels in Figure 6a,b) without exceeding the dissociation limit
of C–H ≥1.34 Å. The very fast hydrogen abstraction
from the methyl group in CH3SH therefore most likely refers
to an increase in constraint caused by mercaptan in the presence of
surface methoxy. The high reaction temperature seems to favor hydrogen
abstraction from the methyl group in mercaptan but not from the S–H
group. It cannot be ruled out that other initial geometries may produce
other radicals such as CH3X•. The very
complex kinetics in the proposed hydrogen pool mechanism8−12 may thus be associated with various speeds and natures of radicals,
formed under particular experimental conditions.

One can speculate
that the competition between hydrogen abstraction
and the C–C bond formation at a given temperature is likely
to be the predominant factor determining the reactivity of methanol
and mercaptan, as well as the rate of coke deposition poisoning the
catalyst. Other mechanisms could also be envisaged. A more thorough
quantitative biased dynamics study of the free-energy profiles is
necessary and will be a subject of future work. Various biased dynamics
techniques, such as umbrella sampling48 or perturbation MD,49 coupled to QM/MM
have been successfully used to unveil catalytic mechanisms at finite
temperatures. On the basis of experiments, the occurrence of radical
decomposition reactions and hydrogen abstraction was apparent in the
mechanism involving the conversion of methanol and mercaptan to ethylene
over acidic WO3/g-Al2O3 catalysts
at T > 327 C, studied by Olah et al.50 In the latter work, the formation of methane
as a byproduct
was associated with the thermal decomposition of dimethylether (CH3OCH3 → CH4 + CH2O).

The present study demonstrates that the differences in the conversion
of mercaptan and methanol over acid zeolite catalysts are not related
to the electronic structures of CH3SH and CH3OH and the intrinsic pathways. Instead, these differences are determined
by the speed and type of radicals arising from CH3SH/CH3OH molecules with constrained motions in the zeolite cavity,
where surface methoxy is found.

Conclusions
DFT
and BOMD were employed to compare methylation reactions by
methanol and methyl mercaptan reagents, to reveal the underlying origins
of the experimentally established differences between MTH and M2TH
processes. For this purpose, we studied the intrinsic PES in the stepwise
mechanism and the role of fast rotational and vibrational motions
for both reagents.

The DFT intrinsic PESs of the dehydration
reactions of CH3XH to surface methoxy do not exhibit any
conclusive difference, from
which to distinguish between methanol and mercaptan.

BOMD simulations
at the experimental temperature (823 K) and the
analysis of the evolution of molecular bonds reveal initial intact
adsorbate structures for the CH3OH and CH3SH
molecules. The dynamics of methyl mercaptan adsorbed in the cavity
with surface methoxy led to the formation of •CH2SH radical. A similar phenomenon occurred for the coadsorbed methanol
and the surface methoxy but after a simulation period of 10 times
the length. Hydrogen abstraction from methanol and mercaptan in zeolites
can be attributed to the hindered C–X rotation because of the
H(CH3)···Osurf and H(XH)···Osurf hydrogen bonds, analogously to the reported hydrogen abstraction
from the −CH3 groups in CH3XH dissolved
in water. Following our DFT static and BOMD (at T = 823 K) results, it is most probable that the different products
observed experimentally from MTH and M2TH processes will relate to
the different rate of radical formation under these experimental conditions.

Models
and Computational Details
The first two gas-phase 4T and
10T models in Figure 1a are used to compute adsorption energies
using DFT methods for the fully optimized structures. The dangling
bonds in these clusters are saturated with H atoms. The adsorbate
ground-state geometries are confirmed by vibrational frequency analysis.
Computed vibrational frequencies are also used to obtain thermal and
entropy contributions to the Gibbs free energies of adsorption, ΔG, for T ≠ 0 in the ideal polyatomic
gas model.43 Zero-point energy corrections
are included in the free energies.

The third 10T/99T model in Figure 1b contains a 10T
cluster (Si9AlO12H21), embedded in
a 99T-zeolite framework (Si96Al3O241H53). The inner Si9AlO12H21 cluster is treated at the DFT level
and the remaining 99T structure is described with the United Force
Field (UFF)51 by using the ONIOM (our own
N-layered integrated molecular orbital and molecular mechanics)52−55 with the embedded QM/MM scheme. This is used to optimize the minima
and maxima structures at the PES of CH3XH dehydration reactions.
The vibrational frequency computation needed to confirm the minima
and the maxima at the PES is also obtained using the ONIOM scheme.
We used the two-layer ONIOM scheme with electronic embedding56 and carried out full geometry optimization of
both the QM and MM regions.57 The energies
of those optimized with ONIOM structures are subsequently computed
at the DFT level that was applied to the entire 109T optimized structures.
This approach was employed to avoid inaccurate energy calculations
from the molecular UFF in the ONIOM embedding scheme.38

The above-described calculations were carried out
with Gaussian
09 program58 with three exchange–correlation
DFT functionals that are the PBE,59 the
hybrid B3LYP functional,60,61 and M06.62 The atomic wave functions were described with
a double-zeta quality basis set, 6-31G(d,p). In all the calculations,
the energy convergence was set up to 10–8 au. The
Berny63 optimization was used for the localization
of the minima, intermediate, and TS structures. The convergence was
based on the root-mean-square forces and displacement vectors with
a threshold of 3.0 × 10–4 and 1.2 × 10–3, respectively.

There is a fourth model named
20T cluster in Figure 1c that is used in the BOMD calculations,
coupled with DFT augmented with an empirical dispersion (DFT-D) method
as implemented in deMon2k program.64−67 This approach was employed to
study the adsorption processes of CH3XH in H-ZSM-5, before
and after the formation of surface methoxy at the experimental temperature.2 The 20T cluster is cut from the optimized (with
ONIOM scheme) 109T geometry (vide supra), and the dangling bonds are
saturated with hydrogens. For the simulations, the outermost O–H
bonds are constrained to the optimized geometry with ONIOM values.
In the BOMD simulations, the temperature of the system set to 823
K was maintained using the Berendsen thermostat (τ = 0.02 ps)
in the NVT ensemble. The velocity Verlet algorithm with a time step
of 0.1 fs was employed. The linear and the angular momenta were conserved
with a threshold of 10–8; therefore, the studied
systems are not allowed to translate and rotate.
