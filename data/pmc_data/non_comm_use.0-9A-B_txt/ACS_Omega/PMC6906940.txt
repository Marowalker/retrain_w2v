In this work, contaminants of emerging concern were catalytically
degraded in the homogeneous phase with the use of unconventional green
reagents. Three reagents, namely, sulfite, metabisulfite, and persulfate,
were tested and compared with conventional hydrogen peroxide in the
degradation process activated by Fe-TAML. The latter is a biodegradable,
homogeneous tetra-amido macrocyclic ligand catalyst containing iron(III).
Metabisulfite showed the highest efficiency among the three tested
reagents, and its reactivity was similar to that of H2O2. However, metabisulfite is a safer and cleaner reagent compared
to H2O2. A comprehensive study of the activity
of metabisulfite with Fe-TAML was carried out toward the oxidative
degradation of eight contaminants of emerging concern. The catalytic
process was tested at different pH values (7, 9, and 11). Metabisulfite
showed the highest activity at pH 11, completely degrading some of
the tested micropollutants, but in several cases, the system was active
at pH 9 as well. In particular, metabisulfite showed the best efficiency
toward phenolic compounds. A preliminary study on the reaction mechanism
and the nature of the active species in the Fe-TAML/metabisulfite
system was also conducted, highlighting that a high-valent iron-oxo
species might be involved in the degradation pathways.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Micropollutants, such
as pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and personal
care products, are persistent and biologically active substances.
They are ubiquitous in aquatic environments and can jeopardize the
life of plants, animals, and humans.1 The
Fenton reaction is a promising advanced oxidation process to reduce
micropollutants in water, and it has been proven effective for the
degradation of a wide variety of recalcitrant and/or non-biodegradable
contaminants in industrial wastewaters.2 The main reactions involved in Fenton oxidation cause the formation
of reactive species, such as—mainly—hydroxyl radicals
and/or superoxidized iron species.2−4 The Fenton process works
best in the pH range of 2.5–4, with the highest degradation
rates usually observed around pH 3.5

Living organisms metabolize micropollutants and potentially toxic
endogenous and exogenous compounds with cytochrome P450, an iron-based
family of enzymes.6 On this basis, Collins
and co-workers have developed an innovative catalyst for water decontamination,
the Fe-TAML activator, which mimics the oxidative activity of cytochrome
P450 by forming a stable iron-oxo species in water when it reacts
with peroxides.7 Fe-TAML has a large spectrum
of applications in the removal of recalcitrant micropollutants and
pathogens from water.8−11 Its reaction usually takes place at room temperature and it is most
effective in the pH range 7.5–11, with the highest rates usually
observed around pH 10–11.12 An oxidation
process that is efficient under basic conditions may be more promising
and useful than a process operating under acidic conditions (e.g.,
the traditional Fenton process), for two main reasons: (i) it does
not require pH adjustments when the water effluent is already alkaline,
as in the case of some industrial effluents; (ii) it allows the coprecipitation
of inorganic cations (e.g., toxic metals) potentially present in the
effluent, thus reducing the need of an ad hoc treatment step and preventing
their possible interfering activity.13,14 In this sense,
oxidation by Fe-TAML or other similar catalysts as tools to improve
the Fenton reaction is potentially advantageous compared to a classic
Fenton process.

Hydrogen peroxide is preferentially used as
the Fenton reagent
because of its relatively low cost, availability on the market, and
fair environmental compatibility. Hydrogen peroxide is also the preferred
reagent in the case of oxidations activated by Fe-TAML.7−11 In addition to hydrogen peroxide, Fe-TAML can activate hypochlorite,
organic peroxides, and oxone.10,15 However, not all these
alternative reagents are convenient in every circumstance. For instance,
hypochlorite may lead to the formation of potentially carcinogenic
chlorinated byproducts.16−19 Organic peroxides and oxone, besides being explosive
and unsafe, have a high cost. Therefore, they may not be easily employed
to treat large flow rates, which are commonly encountered in wastewater
treatment plants.20,21 While being the current best
choice, hydrogen peroxide has also important limitations related to
operational safety, particularly when it is used in large amounts
and concentrations. H2O2 is highly reactive,
and it forms explosive mixtures upon contact with organic compounds.22 Furthermore, it is corrosive and irritant for
eyes, mucous membranes and skin, and its relatively high vapor pressure
poses health risks by inhalation even following short exposure.22 H2O2 has also been classified
as a known animal carcinogen, with unknown relevance on humans.23 Finally, the thermodynamic instability of H2O2 results in a relatively short shelf life, especially
when stored in concentrated solutions and exposed to ambient temperatures.
For all these reasons, research is needed to identify more benign
reagents that combine all of the positive features of hydrogen peroxide
while minimizing safety hazards and operational burdens.

In
preliminary tests, we found that benign species, such as sulfite
and metabisulfite, can be effectively activated by Fe-TAML toward
the degradation of micropollutants. Despite its activity as a reductant,
sulfite can be activated toward the oxidative degradation of organic
compounds.24−26 On the other hand, to the best of our knowledge,
no report is present in the literature regarding this peculiar reactivity
of metabisulfite, S2O52–.
It is a potentially low-cost, low-risk, and eco-friendly reagent,
with limited health effects (e.g., it is used to preserve alcoholic
beverages) and a demonstrated absence of carcinogenic activity.27 Given its generally reducing nature, metabisulfite
is sometimes used as a quencher of oxidative processes, such as Fenton
or hypochlorite treatments.28,29

This work offers
a comprehensive study of the activity of metabisulfite
with Fe-TAML toward the oxidative degradation of a selection of environmental
micropollutants of increasing worldwide concern. A discussion on the
reaction mechanism and the nature of the active species in the Fe-TAML/metabisulfite
system (as it will be shown below, iron-oxo rather than radical based)
is also provided. Fe-TAML is a well-known green catalyst for the oxidative
degradation of various organic contaminants and other compounds.7 However, the discovery of cleaner and safer reagents
different from those previously proposed (e.g., H2O2) is a breakthrough in the field of advanced oxidation processes
because it opens the route toward greener cleaning systems.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Performance of Different Reagents toward the
Degradation of Phenol
The activity of hydrogen peroxide in
the degradation of various classes of contaminants with Fe-TAML is
widely reported in the literature.9−11,30,31 Therefore, here, H2O2 was used as a comparative standard. Figure 1 shows the catalytic degradation
of phenol in three-step addition experiments, using Fe-TAML and sulfite
(SO32–, Figure 1a), metabisulfite (S2O52–, Figure 1b), persulfate (S2O82–, Figure 1c), and
hydrogen peroxide (Figure 1d, only one addition) as reagents. After each addition of
metabisulfite (one every 10 min, i.e., at 0, 10, and 20 min reaction
time), there was significant phenol degradation, soon followed by
stabilization of the phenol concentration, with an overall step-like
trend that closely mirrored the step-wise S2O52– additions. This finding is similar to recent
results, obtained in the framework of the traditional Fenton reaction.32 Duplicates and triplicates of these tests are
presented in Figure S1 of the Supporting Information. The replicate tests showed high robustness, implying the reproducibility
of the adopted experimental procedures. All of the reactions were
quenched by decreasing the pH to a final value <3. Under acidic
conditions, demetallation (decomplexation of the Fe-TAML complex)
is promoted and the catalytic reaction is stopped as a consequence,
also considering the limited reactivity of Fe(III) species with H2O2 and similar reagents under very acidic conditions.33

Figure 1 Degradation of phenol with different reagents. Reagents
were (a)
sulfite, (b) metabisulfite, (c) persulfate, and (d) H2O2. The reactions were carried out in phosphate buffer (10 mM)
by adding 0.1 mM of reagent every 10 min (i.e., at t = 0, 10, and 20 min), with the exception of H2O2 that was added only once at the beginning (t =
0). Initial conditions were [Fe-TAML] = 0.01 mM; [PhOH] = 0.1 mM.

Metabisulfite was more effective than sulfite toward
phenol degradation,
and the highest degradation efficiency for the two reagents was achieved
at pH 11. On the other hand, persulfate did not show any activity
toward the degradation of phenol (further insights below). Table S1
of the Supporting Information reports the
degradation percentages reached at the end of the degradation experiments
for all of the investigated conditions. Wherever a significant reactivity
was observed (i.e., with sulfite, metabisulfite, and mainly hydrogen
peroxide), phenol degradation was very fast immediately after the
addition of the reagent. It then followed a rapid stabilization of
the substrate concentration. This behavior prevented the details of
the degradation kinetics to be monitored with the used experimental
setup, which was based on sample aliquots withdrawal from the reaction
beaker, quenching of the reaction, and successive high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) quantification of the residual substrate
concentration. As a consequence, we could not measure the initial
reaction rate. However, we could easily measure the degradation percentage,
which is the most relevant information in the framework of water treatment.
Additionally, such an approach allowed us to obtain sufficient insight
into the reaction mechanism (vide infra). The first step of the reaction
might be investigated by using the rather outmoded (and, unfortunately,
not easily found nowadays) stopped-flow technique, which has proven,
for instance, suitable for the investigation of the dark traditional
Fenton process.34

In general, the
degradation efficiency was higher at basic pH values.
Because phenol undergoes acid–base equilibrium (pKa 9.95),35 at pH 9, the phenolate
anion (PhO–) starts to be significantly present,
while at pH 11, it prevails. Phenolate is more easily oxidized than
neutral PhOH. In the case of H2O2, an almost
complete degradation of phenol took place at both pH 9 and 11 with
just one hydrogen peroxide addition. In contrast, at pH 7, the H2O2 treatment was less effective. The pH trend of
the degradation efficiency was consistent with that reported by Collins
et al. when using H2O2;12 please see further details in the Supporting Information.

Interestingly, the system containing Fe-TAML
+ persulfate was unable
to induce significant degradation of phenol at any of the investigated
pH values. It may be reasonable to assume that the inactivity of persulfate
depends on poor complexation capability (steric hindrance) of the
persulfate anion with the metal center of Fe-TAML (vide infra).36,37

The reported results suggest that metabisulfite is less effective
than hydrogen peroxide in the degradation of phenol, but it is the
most effective among the alternative reagents investigated here. Because
of the lower cost and hazards of metabisulfite compared to H2O2, its reaction conditions were optimized, and its potential
as a H2O2 substitute was further investigated
for the degradation of other contaminants of emerging concern (CECs).
Some phenol degradation experiments were carried out to identify the
experimental conditions able to maximize its transformation with metabisulfite.
In particular, we wanted to assess whether the best degradation conditions
could be reached with multistep additions of metabisulfite at relatively
low concentration, or with a single addition of the reagent at higher
concentration. Figure 2 shows the results of the experiments carried out with Fe-TAML and
metabisulfite at different pH values (7, 9, and 11), with only one
addition of the reagent at concentrations of 0.3 mM (Figure 2a) and 0.1 mM (Figure 2b; this latter experiment is
similar to the first addition step reported in Figure 1b). Phenol concentration was monitored for
up to 60 min. As expected, the reaction was very fast in the first
1–2 min after the addition of the reagent and it followed a
rapid stabilization of phenol concentration afterward. The overall
degradation performance was better when the concentration of metabisulfite
was higher (i.e., 0.3 mM), but the best results were definitely achieved
when the same overall amount of metabisulfite was added in three separate
steps (100% degradation, see Figure 1b), rather than in a single addition (80% degradation, Figure 2a). It is reasonable
to assume that, in the case of a single large addition, the reagent
itself partly scavenges the reactive species, as often observed in
the classic Fenton process (note that metabisulfite has a reducing
character). In fact, within the same time interval, more reagent (higher
concentration of metabisulfite) is available to react with the reactive
species present in the system, compared with the addition of the same
overall amount of the reagent in separate steps.32 Based on these results, the multiple addition approach
appears to be the most rational way to use the S2O52– reagent, and it was chosen hereafter
to perform the degradation of the contaminants under study.

Figure 2 Degradation
of phenol with metabisulfite as the reagent. The reactions
were carried out in phosphate buffer (10 mM), with initial concentrations
[Fe-TAML] = 0.01 mM; [PhOH] = 0.1 mM, and adding one aliquot of metabisulfite
with initial concentrations of (a) 0.3 and (b) 0.1 mM.

2.2 Comparison of Metabisulfite (S2O52–) and Hydrogen Peroxide in the Degradation
of CECs
The ability of Fe-TAML to activate metabisulfite
was tested against the degradation of additional micropollutants. Figure 3 shows the percentage
of contaminant degradation after 1 h reaction time, when metabisulfite
was used as the reagent at different pH values (7, 9, and 11). The
reaction was carried out by adding 0.1 mM of metabisulfite for a total
of three times, once every 10 min (i.e., with a final concentration
of 0.3 mM). After the last addition, the system was monitored for
an additional 40 min to observe possible further degradation of the
tested contaminant (see Figures S2–S8 in the Supporting Information for the whole time trends). The same
contaminants were also degraded following the analogous protocol but
by using H2O2 at pH 11 instead of S2O52–. This operational pH value was
chosen because it is well known to maximize the degradation efficiency
with the couple Fe-TAML/H2O2. The generally
accepted reason for this pH behavior is twofold: (i) the Fe-TAML complex
is involved in an acid–base equilibrium between the axial diaqua
species [FeL(OH2)2]− and the
deprotonated form [FeL(OH2)(OH)]2– (L
= TAML, pKa > 11); at the same time,
(ii)
H2O2 behaves as well like a weak acid with pKa ≈ 11.2–11.6;12 see more details in the Supporting Information. Our experimental results suggest that metabisulfite
and hydrogen peroxide have similar activity toward the chosen contaminants.
Specifically, Fe-TAML could activate efficiently both S2O52– and H2O2 in
the degradation of the phenolic compounds BP3, TCS, and PhOH. Moreover,
both processes were also efficient in the degradation of DCF. On the
other hand, although metabisulfite was marginally more active than
hydrogen peroxide toward acesulfame K (ACE), naproxen (NPX), ibuprofen
(IBU), and atrazine (ATZ), both reagents were largely ineffective
toward these contaminants. Replicate tests suggested high reproducibility
of these reaction processes, with final degradation yields from different
tests always within 5% of the average value; see Figure S9 in the Supporting Information to see results from some
test replicates.

Figure 3 Degradation percentage of the studied CEC. Metabisulfite
or H2O2 were used as reagents at different pH
values.
The reactions were carried out for 60 min in phosphate buffer (10
mM), by adding 0.1 mM of the reagent every 10 min for a total of three
additions (at 0, 10, and 20 min). Initial conditions were [Fe-TAML]
= 0.01 mM and [contaminant] = 0.1 mM.

Previous literature has reported that Fe-TAML forms
an iron-oxo
active species with peroxides.10,12,38 The iron-oxo species is electrophilic, and it tends to react with
electron-rich compounds that are easily oxidized. Coming back to our
data, the complete degradation of PhOH and the inactivity of the process
toward ACE (see Figure 3) are consistent with a peculiar role of oxidants with middle-high
redox potential (such as iron-oxo species, vide infra) in both the
Fe-TAML/H2O2 and the Fe-TAML/S2O52– chemistry. Indeed, PhOH39 is definitely electron richer than ACE40 (see also the electrochemical evidences reported below).
The results, in terms of the Fe-TAML + H2O2 reaction
efficiency, may thus be rationalized with the different electronic
structure of the contaminants, in agreement with Chen and White.41 Then, because metabisulfite showed the same
efficiency trend as H2O2 toward the chosen contaminants,
we can tentatively assume as a working hypothesis that there is a
close analogy between the reactive species involved in the two cases.

Interestingly, when the Fe-TAML + S2O52– process led to quantitative or almost quantitative
substrate transformation (i.e., with PhOH, BP3, and TCS), the degradation
efficiency was very similar at both pH 9 and 11, while the degradation
at pH 7 was less effective. Conversely, when the degradation was inefficient
(i.e., with ACE, NPX, IBU, and ATZ), it was so at all of the tested
pH values. DCF is the only instance in which we observed a gradual
increase of the degradation efficiency throughout the entire interval
of increasing pH. Differently from DCF, the phenolic compounds PhOH,
BP3, and TCS undergo acid–base equilibria in the pH interval
7–11, thereby yielding the corresponding easily oxidized phenolates
at high pH.35 For this reason, the case
of DCF, which does not undergo acid–base equilibrium changes
between pH 7 and 11, is likely to better reflect the genuine pH trend
of the Fe-TAML + S2O52– reactivity.
Note that a low Fe-TAML activity at pH 7 has already been reported
in a previous paper describing the Fe-TAML activation of H2O2.12

Different from
the classic Fenton reaction at acidic pH, which
is mainly driven by the production of hydroxyl radicals42 and is usually poorly selective toward different
pollutants, the Fe-TAML-activated process was definitely more selective
(see Figure 3). On
the one hand, this means that a smaller number of contaminants can
be targeted with Fe-TAML-Fenton compared to Fe2+ + H2O2. However, higher selectivity (i.e., the ability
of the catalyst to discriminate amongst different compounds) might
improve the degradation efficiency of target contaminants in a multipolluted
aqueous environment, especially in the presence of interfering agents,
such as the inherently harmless organic matter. Organic matter usually
does not require a dedicated degradation step, but it is accidentally
degraded by hydroxyl radicals and, by consuming them, it may inhibit
the traditional Fenton process.43 In contrast,
by virtue of higher selectivity, iron-oxo-based treatments may be
less prone to interferences from organic matter.

2.3 Discussion on the Nature of the Active Species
and the Reaction Mechanism
While it is accepted that systems
containing Fe-TAML + H2O2 have an iron-oxo species
as reactive transient,10,12,38 there is no piece of information concerning the behavior of Fe-TAML
+ S2O52–, or the nature of
the resulting active species. Indeed, this system is here described
for the first time. As mentioned above, Fe-TAML + H2O2 and Fe-TAML + S2O52– had analogous reactivity at pH 11 toward the studied substrates.
Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the formed active
species share some similarities. Tests were conducted to assess whether
the main active species of Fe-TAML + S2O52– has radical or nonradical nature. Although we could
not rely on any previous report concerning the S2O52–-based Fenton process, possible reactive
radical species in, for example, sulfite-based Fenton systems are
hydroxyl (•OH) and sulfate (SO4•–).44 In contrast, a Fe-based oxidant could
trigger a nonradical pathway, in analogy with Fe-TAML + H2O2.

To get mechanistic insight into the studied
process, tert-butanol (t-BuOH) and
isopropyl alcohol (2-PrOH) were added into the solution as radical
scavengers during the transformation of phenol. 2-PrOH is very reactive
with hydroxyl radicals (k = 1.9 × 109 M–1 s–1)13 and significantly less so with sulfate radicals (k = 4 × 107 M–1 s–1).45 On the other hand, t-BuOH shows similar reactivity with both •OH (k = 4 × 108 M–1 s–1) and SO4•– (k = 3.6 × 108 M–1 s–1).13,45 Different phenol degradation
experiments were thus carried out with Fe-TAML and metabisulfite,
in the presence of t-BuOH and 2-PrOH. Scavenger/phenol
concentration ratios of 400:1 (t-BuOH) and 1330:1
(2-PrOH) were used. Considering the reaction rate constants of phenol/phenolate
with •OH (kPhOH and kPhO– ≈ 1010 M–1 s–1)13 and SO4•– (kPhOH = 2.2 × 109 M–1 s–1,46kPhO– unknown but possibly similar, and
<1010 M–1 s–1),13 it is expected that t-BuOH
causes a ∼95% inhibition of phenol degradation if •OH is the reactive species (i.e., the degradation should be ∼20
times lower with the alcohol). Moreover, almost total quenching by t-BuOH is expected in the case of SO4•–. Similarly, inhibition by PrOH should be quantitative with •OH, and in the order of ∼90% with SO4•–.

The results shown in Figure 4a,b indicate that
the alcohols caused limited inhibition of
phenol degradation by Fe-TAML + S2O52– at pH 7 and practically no inhibition at pH 11. These results are
not consistent with the occurrence of either •OH
or SO4–• as the main reactive
species, especially at the higher pH value (11), where we would expect
inhibition to be much more evident in the case of a dominant role
of the hydroxyl and sulfate radicals as reactive species of the process.
Moreover, the two alcohols produced very similar and limited effects
on the degradation of BP3, with both Fe-TAML + H2O2 and Fe-TAML + S2O52–, at both pH 7 and 11 (see Figure 4c–f). This analogy in behavior further suggests
that similar reactive species may be involved in Fe-TAML + H2O2 and Fe-TAML + S2O52–. In the case of Fe-TAML + H2O2, the reactive
species is well known to be of a nonradical nature.10,12,38 By analogy, and given the overall results,
it is reasonable to believe that an iron-oxo species may also occur
in Fe-TAML + S2O52–. The limited,
observed inhibition of the degradation process by alcohols would be
due to the slight reactivity of the iron-oxo species (less oxidant
with respect to •OH or SO4–•, vide infra) toward PrOH and t-BuOH, with no need
to invoke radical-based reactions.

Figure 4 Effects of different quenchers on the
degradation reaction. Quenchers
were t-BuOH (40 mM) or 2-PrOH (133 mM), tested in
the degradation of (a,b) phenol or (c–f) BP3. The reagents
were (a–d) metabisulfite or (e,f) H2O2, and the pH was 7 (left column) or 11 (right column). Reactions
were carried out in phosphate buffer (10 mM), adding 0.1 mM metabisulfite
(or H2O2) every 10 min, for a total of three
additions (at 0, 10, and 20 min). Initial conditions were as follows:
[Fe-TAML] = 0.01 mM; [PhOH] = [BP3] = 0.1 mM.

A tentative outline of the mechanism of activation
of H2O2 by Fe-TAML has already been proposed
(Figure 5a).12 It has been reported that the activation of
H2O2 occurs via the heterolytic cleavage of
its O–O bond, after
coordination to the iron center. The cleavage of the O–O bond
is reasonably helped by proton transfer, followed by water release
and formation of an iron-oxo complex.12 Taking inspiration from the hydrogen peroxide activation mechanism,
in the case of the Fe-TAML/metabisulfite system, it is reasonable
to suggest that the initial formation of the Fe–O–SR
intermediate may be followed by heterolytic O–S cleavage, yielding
the related iron-oxo species (Figure 5b). This would also tentatively explain why persulfate
was not activated by Fe-TAML (Figure 1c). In the case of unreactive persulfate, the coordination
of iron(III) should involve either sulfonyl or peroxo oxygen. The
former may be too stable for resonance, and the corresponding π*
orbital of the O–S fragment would be too distant from the reducing
Fe(III) center, while the latter may be sterically hindered because
of the geometry of the persulfate molecule. Although this outline
looks reasonable and agrees with the experimental data, further work
is needed to confirm this rationalization and the related mechanisms.

pathways in the activation of reagents by Fe-TAML. (a)

by Ghosh et al.,12 and (b) proposed pathway
for the activation of metabisulfite.

The oxidation potentials recorded for the CECs
studied in the present
work by using the cyclic voltammetry (CV) technique (Table 1) are coherent with the mechanism
here proposed. All of the CECs under study have oxidation onset potentials
between 0.05 and 1.75 V versus Ag/AgCl. The reported values were obtained
by averaging three CV scans (see Figures S10–S17 of the Supporting Information for the raw CV data).

ACE	0.90	0.90	Although an anodic current onset can be appreciated
for ACE,
the oxidation current is always very low and an anodic peak is never
observed. In fact, for the analytical determination of ACE, Pierini
et al.48 have exploited its reduction.
Because of limited solubility in CH3CN, the same measurement
was repeated in water at pH 10. No
anodic current was observed compared with the blank run

scan only. The potential of the anodic peak observed in the successive
scans corresponds with literature data49	
IBU	1.62	1.62	The oxidation onset potential corresponds very well to the
results of Lima et al.,50 obtained using
a boron-doped diamond	
DCF	0.05	0.05	The results obtained are coherent with the
literature.50 Nevertheless, in that report,
the authors reported
significantly larger sensitivity in the 0 V/0.6 V potential window thanks to the modification of the glassy carbon

ATZ	1.75	1.75	ATZ is only oxidized at a very positive potential.
In fact,
for ATZ determination, Svorc et al.51 exploited
its reduction	
PhOH	0.70	0.80	The oxidation onset potential decreases
on successive scans
because of the formation of catechol and hydroquinone52	
BP3	0.90	1.25	The anodic peak at 1.05 V (with
corresponding oxidation onset at 0.9 V) is only observed if the potential is previously swept below 0 V. The main oxidation onset corresponds very well
to the results reported by Sunyer et al53	
TCS	0.60	0.60	Very similar values have been found by Fotouhi et al54	
a The onset potential is reported
for both the first and the successive scans of the CVs.

These results are coherent with previously published
values, although
the experimental conditions are not fully comparable. The radicals •OH or SO4–• have
more positive reduction potentials (2.5 V or above vs SHE, i.e., at
least 2.2 V vs Ag/AgCl) in the pH window under investigation; thus,
they are able to oxidize all of the CECs under study and lead to their
degradation.47 A less oxidant active species,
such as the hypothesized iron-oxo one, could only effectively oxidize
the most reducing CECs, while having negligible reactivity toward
the least reducing substrates. In fact, the CECs here considered could
be divided into two groups based on their redox potentials: ACE, ATZ,
BP3, IBU, and NPX can only be oxidized at potentials larger than 0.8
V versus Ag/AgCl, while DCF, PhOH, and TCS can be oxidized at potentials
lower than 0.8 V. The CECs of the first group are only marginally
(<20%) abated by Fe-TAML/metabisulfite, with the notable exception
of BP3. Indeed, BP3 degradation exceeded 80% at basic pH despite an
onset potential as high as 0.90 V (1.25 V for the first scan, if the
initial potential is more positive than 0.2 V). This implies that
the redox behavior of BP3 and, consequently, its degradation with
Fe-TAML/metabisulfite is hardly described by the onset potential only.
In contrast, a first reduction step might trigger BP3 degradation.
The compounds with oxidation potential below 0.8 V, that is, DCF,
PhOH, and TCS were all significantly degraded by Fe-TAML + S2O52–, especially at pH 11, in agreement
with the CV data. Hence, the hypothesized iron-oxo reactive intermediate
should have a redox potential of around 0.8/1 V versus Ag/AgCl, which
allows for the oxidation of compounds such as DCF, PhOH, and TCS,
but it is insufficient to significantly degrade ACE, ATZ, IBU, and
NPX.

Note that the CV profiles allow for a first qualitative
description,
but specific interactions between the active species and the substrate
could activate additional mechanisms, which are not operational during
the electrochemical oxidation processes at the glassy carbon electrode
in CH3CN. Conversely, kinetic limitations could impede
some oxidation reactions, although they are thermodynamically possible.

3 Experimental Section
3.1 Chemicals
Fe(III)-TAML was purchased
from GreenOx Catalysts Inc. (Pittsburgh, PA, U.S.A.) Sodium phosphate
tribasic was obtained from Carlo Erba (Italy). All of the other reagents,
buffer solutions, and solvents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Water was of Milli-Q quality [total organic carbon (TOC) 2 ppb, resistivity
≥18.2 MΩ cm].

3.2 Preparation of the Fe-TAML Stock Solution
A stock solution of Fe-TAML was prepared by dissolving 520 mg Fe-TAML
in 200 mL of a sodium hydroxide solution (0.05 M). The supernatant
of this solution was used for further experiments. UV–vis analysis
was carried out to determine the effective Fe-TAML concentration at
pH 7, by measuring light absorbance at 360 nm. From the known Fe-TAML
absorption coefficient (6600 M–1 cm–1), a stock solution with a concentration of 3.1 mM was prepared.
The stability of the catalyst in solution was spectrophotometrically
checked every month. The stock solution was stored refrigerated (4
°C) under the N2 atmosphere.

3.3 Protocol of the Oxidation Experiments
Three different reagents (sodium sulfite, SO32–, potassium metabisulfite, S2O52–, and sodium persulfate, S2O82–) were preliminarily tested, and their reactivity was compared with
that of hydrogen peroxide. The most reactive compound, namely, metabisulfite,
was then chosen to carry out further degradation experiments on several
contaminants. Finally, the reaction mechanism with metabisulfite was
investigated. The degradation experiments were carried out at room
temperature, under continuous stirring for a maximum of 60 min. Reactions
were tested at different pH values (7, 9, and 11) in 10 mL of phosphate
buffer (total concentration 0.01 M). Under such conditions, the demetallation
of Fe-TAML via the general acid mechanism can be considered negligible.33,55 As shown in previous literature reports, the demetallation kinetics
of Fe-TAML increases as the pH decreases, or as the concentration
of the buffering agents increases at constant pH. For these reasons,
the phosphate buffer concentration used in this study was as low as
reported in previous works.12,55 It is important to
note that the mechanism of demetallation has not yet been fully understood.

Unless otherwise stated, the default initial concentrations in
the experiments were as follows: 0.01 mM of Fe-TAML, 0.1 mM of the
target contaminant, and 0.1 mM of the reagent (H2O2, SO32–, S2O52–, or S2O82–). During some tests, step-wise additions of the reagent corresponding
each to a 0.1 mM concentration in the reaction system were made every
10 min, for a total of three additions. In all of these latter cases,
the overall molar ratio of the Fe-TAML/contaminant/reagent was 1:10:30.
All of the reactions were quenched by decreasing the pH to a final
value <3. Under acidic conditions, demetallation is promoted and
the catalytic reaction is stopped as a consequence.33 In some experiments involving metabisulfite, control tests
were performed by analysis of the solutions immediately following
reaction and without acidification. No significant differences in
the concentration of contaminants were observed with or without acidification
of the solution.

3.4 Analytical Methods
UV–vis
spectrophotometric measurements were performed using a Cary 100 Scan
double-beam instrument (Varian). The concentrations of contaminants
in solution were monitored by HPLC coupled with diode array detection
(HPLC-DAD). The adopted LaChrom Elite instrument (VWR-Hitachi) was
equipped with a L-2200 Autosampler (injection volume 60 μL),
a L-2130 quaternary pump for low-pressure gradients, a L-2300 column
oven (set at 40 °C), and a L-2455 DAD detector. The column was
a RP-C18 LiChroCART (VWR Int., length 125 mm, diameter 4 mm), packed
with LiChrospher 100 RP-18 (5 μm diameter).

The different
test contaminants were always eluted in isocratic mode, with a mixture
of A = 5.7 mmol L–1 H3PO4 in water and B = methanol, at a flow rate of 1 mL
min–1. The following conditions were used (λ
= detection wavelength, tR = retention
time): ACE (5% B, λ = 220 nm and tR = 4 min); ATZ (60% B, λ = 221 nm and tR = 4.5 min); diclofenac (DCF, 65% B, λ = 275 nm and tR = 8 min); ibuprofen (IBU, 70% B, λ =
222 nm and tR = 6 min); NPX (60% B, λ
= 220 nm and tR = 6 min); oxybenzone (aka benzophenone-3, BP3, 70% B, λ = 280 nm and tR = 5 min); phenol (PhOH, 30% B, λ = 271
nm and tR = 5.5 min); triclosan (TCS,
70% B, λ = 280 nm and tR = 9.6 min).

Note that the study of the degradation of the investigated substrates
cannot be considered in terms of the evolution of the TOC in solution,
because (i) the Fe-TAML catalyst is in the homogeneous form and (ii)
the organic TAML ligand increases the overall TOC value, thereby interfering
with the assessment of contaminant mineralization. Still, the studied
systems are unlikely to achieve substrate mineralization, as suggested
by the occurrence of several unknown HPLC peaks, presumably accounted
for by transformation intermediates (more hydrophilic than the original
substrates on the basis of their chromatographic retention times),
even at long reaction times.

3.5 Electrochemical Measurements
The
redox properties and stability of the investigated substrates were
electrochemically investigated. The electrochemical experiments were
carried out through a standard photoelectrochemical setup and a computer-controlled
potentiostat (PGSTAT12, Autolab). The electrochemical cell was a conventional
three-electrode cell. The counter and reference electrodes were a
glassy carbon rod (diameter 2 mm, length 75 mm) and a Ag/AgCl/KCl
(3 M) electrode, respectively. The working electrode was a 5 mm diameter
glassy carbon disk. The electrolytic solution was 0.1 M NaClO4 in CH3CN, purged with nitrogen gas. CVs were recorded
between −0.4 and 2.0 V, at a scan rate of 100 mV s–1. To better detect the onset of the anodic current, CVs were recorded
on 10 mM solutions of each studied compound, with the exceptions of
ATZ and ACE. In the latter cases, CVs were recorded on saturated CH3CN solutions. The CVs here reported are the average of at
least three successive scans, unless otherwise stated.
