A giant
electrocaloric effect is reported in (Pb0.97La0.02)(Zr0.95Ti0.05)O3 anti-ferroelectric
ceramics. These samples were fabricated by a
solid-state mixed oxide technique. Dielectric analyses were employed
to investigate the anti-ferroelectric (AFE) and ferroelectric (FE)
phase transitions of the sample. During the heating process, the phase
transition from the orthorhombic anti-ferroelectric phase (AFEO) to the tetragonal anti-ferroelectric phase (AFET) occurs at 155 °C, and the phase transition from AFET to PE occurs at 225 °C. Using the Maxwell relationship, the
entropy change ΔS and adiabatic temperature
change ΔT were obtained at different electric
fields ranging from 40 to 65 kV/cm. The maximum adiabatic temperature
change (ΔTmax = −7.47 K)
was obtained at 50 kV/cm, which was attributed to the field-induced
phase transformation between the anti-ferroelectric and ferroelectric
phases. These results showed that PLZT2/95/5 ceramics possess a large
negative electrocaloric effect value, which could be applied in achieving
cooling power as refrigerants.

1 Introduction
An
electrocaloric (EC) effect, the temperature of polar materials
changes if an extra electric field is applied or removed, is very
likely to be applied in advanced cooling devices for integrated electronics
and sensors. For instance, compared with the traditional cooling technology,
the refrigeration system based on EC presents a remarkable improvement
in cooling efficiency, and the cooling process has no environmental
pollution.1−3 Among the methods proposed to obtain a large EC effect,
based on the perovskite-structured oxides with significant temperature-dependent
spontaneous polarization, many research studies focus on the concerns
thermodynamic phenomena occurring in ferroelectric (FE) and anti-ferroelectric
(AFE) materials due to the electric-field-operated phase transition.4 These materials show large potential as dielectrics
in high-energy-density electrical capacitors and in improving the
on-board cooling requirements of advanced electronics.

In recent
years, numerous studies have shown that positive or negative
EC effects exist in various FE/AFE membrane systems.5−12 The negative EC effect was discovered by researchers in Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-PbTiO3 materials.8 In particular, it is expected that the negative
EC effect could be applied in cooling devices, which requires a large
negative adiabatic temperature change (ΔT)
and isothermal entropy change (ΔS). To obtain
a larger ΔT value, most researchers paid attention
to thin films that are suitable for a large applied electric field.
Although thin films work better in miniature cooling equipment, bulk
materials have more advantages in the middle- and large-scale equipment.3,13 Furthermore, the actual cooling capacity and the EC strength of 
their bulk counterparts, such as single crystals and ceramics, are
generally larger than those of thin films. Hence, the exploitation
of the EC effect in bulk materials is significant and necessary.

In this work, ceramic samples were synthesized by a solid-state
mixed oxide technique. The phase transition of the samples was determined
by dielectric measurements. Furthermore, a giant negative EC value
of −7.47 K was calculated according to the Maxwell relation
and the thermal variation of polarization–electric field (P–E) hysteresis loops, which was
related to the electric-field-induced AFE phase. Based on the giant
negative electrocaloric effect (ECE) value in the study, this sample
could be applied in ceramic capacitors with ECE cooling devices.

2 Results and Discussion
Figure 1 exhibits
the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of PLZT2/95/5 ceramic
samples. We can see from the image that the grain boundary is obvious
and the average size of the boundary is about 5–7 μm
for fine-grained ceramics. Based on Archimedes’ principle,
the measured sample density is equal to ∼95% of the theoretical
density,14 indicating that the fabricated
samples were confirmed to be dense.

microstructure of PLZT2/95/5
ceramic samples.

As shown in Figure 2a,b, the dielectric
constant (εr) and dielectric
loss (tan δ) of PLZT2/95/5 ceramic samples varied with
temperature at different frequencies from 1 to 20 k Hz. The εr–T curves with varying frequencies
from 1 to 20 k Hz have no obvious variation at temperatures ranging
from 0 to 400 °C. Two anomalous peaks could be seen in Figure 2a, and the corresponding
dielectric constants for them are 742 and 4489, respectively. The
first anomalous peak at 155 °C illustrates that a phase transition
from AFEO to AFET occurs in this region, and
the second anomalous peak at 225 °C corresponds to another phase
transition from AFET to PE.15−22

changes as a function of temperature for PLZT2/95/5 at various frequencies.

Figure 3 shows the P–E loops of the samples
measured at different temperatures
with the maximum applied field of 60 kV/cm. As can be seen from Figure 3a,b, the polarizations
measured at 40 and 150 °C are very small. The typical AFE double
P–E loops are obtained in Figure 3c–e at 60 kV/cm. First, the forward
direction of the electric field is analyzed. Under a low electric
field, the hysteresis loop shows a straight line. When the electric
field is added to a certain intensity (corresponding to the EF in the diagram), the sample undergoes phase
transition from the AFE to FE metastable phase, which causes a sudden
increase of polarization. The critical field values for the phase
transitions at different temperatures are not the same. As the temperature
increases, this critical field value decreases from 52 kV/cm at 155
°C to 45 kV/cm at 175 °C; when the temperature increases
to 205 °C, it continues to drop to 30 kV/cm. When the temperature
further increases to 210 °C, a typical ferroelectric hysteresis
loop diagram is shown in Figure 3f, indicating that the AFE phase in this region is
quite weak, thus the electric-field-inducting phase transition is
very small. With the temperature further increasing to 225 °C,
a phase transition from the AFE to PE occur, and the AFE phase at
high temperature is probably AFET; similar results were
reported by Hao.47 On the other hand, look
at the forward electric field in Figure 3c–e when the electric field drops.
It can be seen that when the electric field drops to a certain value
(corresponding to EA in the diagram),
a transition from the FE phase to the AFE phase occurs, which causes
a sudden decrease of polarization. When the applied voltage drops
to 0, the remnant polarization of the sample at 155 °C is 0 as
shown in Figure 3,
indicating a complete anti-ferroelectric phase. As shown in Figure 3d, the phase transition
from AFE to FE  occurs at a lower electric field when the temperature
increases to 175 °C, indicating that the AFE phase is more unstable
at this temperature. The polarization at 205 °C shown in Figure 3e is relatively large,
indicating that this is the coexistence phase of the AFE and FE. Many
PLZT ceramics have similar phase-transition reactions,23,24 so a small electric field can cause a sudden change of polarization.
This result demonstrates that the FE phase becomes more stable as
the temperature increases, so the phase transition process from
AFE to FE becomes more easier. When the electric field reaches EA, the phase translates from FE to AFE, and
when the electric field reaches EF, the
phase recovered from AFE to FE. The decrease of EF with increasing temperature suggests that the AFE phase
was more and more unstable while the FE phase became more and more
stable. According to the dielectric analysis results, the sample will
be transformed into the PE phase above 225 °C. However, owing
to the fact that the ceramics were immersed in silicone oil in the
measurements and would break down when the temperatures were beyond
220 °C, P–E data were obtained from 40
to 210 °C (which were not up to the transition temperature).

Figure 3 P–E hysteresis loops of PLZT2/95/5 ceramics
measured at different temperatures: (a) 40 °C, (b) 150 °C,
(c) 155 °C, (d) 175 °C, (e) 205 °C, and (f) 210 °C.

On the basis of P–E loops,
the isothermal
entropy change ΔS and the adiabatic change
in temperature ΔT of the ceramics can be calculated
by using Maxwell’s relations as follows25−29 1   2  where ρ represents the density of the
PLZT ceramic, C represents the specific heat capacity,
∂P/∂T represents the
pyroelectric coefficient, the external electric field ranges from E1 to E2, ΔS represents the isothermal entropy change, and ΔT represents the adiabatic temperature change. The measured
density of the sample is 5.53 g cm–3. Based on a
fourth-order polynomial fitting to the cubic-spline interpolation
of the raw P–E hysteresis loop data, the upper
branch of the hysteresis loops was used to calculate the curves of
polarization as a function of temperature under different applied
electric fields.30 The calculated results
are presented in Figure 4a, and the applied electric field varied from 40 to 65 kV/cm. As
is shown in Figure 4a, the polarization at low temperatures (below 400 K) at all measured
electric fields is negligible. With an increase in temperature, the
polarization increases gradually. There are two polarization peaks
observed in Figure 4a, suggesting the two phase transitions.

Figure 4 (a) Polarization, (b)
pyroelectric coefficient, (c) isothermal
entropy change, and (d) adiabatic temperature change as a function
of temperature under different electric fields for the PLZT2/95/5
ceramics.

The small peak corresponds to
the FE–AFE transition and
the big one corresponds to the AFE–PE transition, respectively.
For different external electric fields, the corresponding temperature
of the polarization peak is different. With an increase of the applied
electric filed, the peak moves toward a lower temperature, indicating
the changing trend of the phase-transition temperature. According
to the slope of the curve in Figure 4a, we can get the thermoelectric coefficient. As is
shown in Figure 4b,
the pyroelectric coefficient under different bias fields is a function
of temperature. The pyroelectric coefficient (∂P/∂T) can be obtained by numerical differentiation
of the P–T data in Figure 4a, which were extracted
from the upper branches of the P–E loops in E > 0, as seen from Figure 3, and was fitted with a fourth-order
polynomial
equation. Figure 4b
shows that the pyroelectric coefficient (∂P/∂T) decreased with the increase of the external
electric field. The temperature dependence of the specific heat capacity
of PLZT2/95/5 ceramics on cooling runs is shown in the inset of Figure 4b. As we all know,
structural phase transitions can be reflected by changes in specific
heat capacity. For the sample, the specific heat capacity (C) calculated from the inset was about 0.48 J g–1 K–1.31 The two peaks
induced by the applied electric field correspond to the FE–AFE
and AFE–PE phase transitions,32 respectively.
The positions of the two peaks were To = 428 K and Tc = 498 K (155 and 225
°C), respectively, consistent with the dielectric measurements.

According to eqs 1 and 2, the value of ΔS and ΔT could be obtained from the P–E hysteresis loops. Temperature dependence of ΔS and ΔT for PLZT ceramics at several
electric fields is given in Figure 4c,d, respectively. As you can see from Figure 4, the ceramic shows a negative
card effect. The emergence of two peaks for ΔS and ΔT at different electric fields in Figure 4c,d can be explained
by the two phase transitions. With an increase in the electric field,
the two peak locations in Figure 4c,d decrease gradually to a lower temperature, similarly
corresponding to the results in Figure 4a,b. Changes in the position of the entropy change
peak and the temperature change peak at different voltages may be
related to the effect of temperature on the stability of the FE, AFE,
and PE phases.33 Samples with relatively
large ΔS and ΔT values
at the phase-transition temperature agree with previous literature.34−36 The maximum entropy change ΔSmax and temperature change ΔTmax occur
in the second phase-transition zone at high temperature. The values
of ΔSmax and ΔTmax are listed in Table 1 according to Figure 4c,d. Comparing the maximum values obtained by different
electric fields in Table 1, it was found that upon increasing the applied electric field
from 40 to 65 kV/cm, the maximum value of ΔTmax increases first and then decreases. The maximum change
is −7.47 K, which occurs when the electric field is 50 kV/cm.
The change in the electrical card effect in anti-ferroelectric ceramics
may be caused by the synergy of relaxation in anti-ferroelectric ceramics.

As we all know, ΔT is an important parameter
to determine the ECE, which depends on the external electric field
and the magnitudes of the external electric fields, where the latter
is effected by electrical breakdown strength of the materials. Many
reports about calculated peak values of ΔT are
shown in Table 1.37−45 From Table 1, it
is noticed that the absolute value of ΔT (−7.47
K) for this sample is obviously larger than previously reported values,
and it implies that the ceramic materials we prepared have excellent
negative electrocaloric performance. Generally, the theoretical calculation
results according to eqs 1 and 2 are less than that from direct measurement.46 Therefore, the actual ECE temperature change
of PLZT2/95/5 ceramics may be larger than the calculated value in
this work, which will be greatly beneficial for the application of
EC-based solid-state cooling systems.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, excellent ECE properties had been found in PLZT2/95/5
ceramics. The ECE results demonstrated that PLZT2/95/5 ceramics had
a large negative ECE (−7.47 K), which was relevant to the applied
electric-field-induced FE phase and AFE phase. These data demonstrated
the existence of a large negative ECE in PLZT2/95/5 ceramics. Based
on these results, it can be concluded that PLZT2/95/5 ceramics possess
a large recoverable energy-storage density and electrocaloric effect
value, which could be applied in high energy-storage density ceramic
capacitors and in achieving cooling power as refrigerants.

4 Experimental Procedure
In this paper, the samples were
successfully prepared by means
of the mixed oxide method. The detailed processes are as follows:
First, on the basis of the formula, TiO2, PbO, ZrO2, and La2O3 were weighted in the standard
stoichiometry. Considering the evaporation effect, PbO was 5% overdose.
Then, we mixed precursor oxides in ethanol for 24 h and presintered
it at 850 °C in an alumina crucible for 2 h. After several cycles
of milling and drying, the calcined fine powder was cold pressed into
cylindrical pellets with 10–12 mm diameter and 1–2 mm
thickness by applying a hydraulic press. Finally, Pb(Zr0.95Ti0.05)O3 was used as a spacer powder
to maintain the PbO atmosphere. The ceramics were sintered at 1320
°C for 5 h.

The surface morphology was characterized by
a field-emission scanning
electronic microscope (JSM-7001F, JEOL, Japan). To conduct the electric
properties, all ceramic samples are polished to 0.8 mm and both sides
were covered with silver paste to serve as electrodes. The
temperature dependence of dielectrics, the polarization–electric
field (P–E) loops, and the density of all
of the ceramics were measured by Agilent E4980A, Radiant Technologies
Precision Premier II (Albuquerque, NM) and a differential scanning
calorimeter (DSC8000), respectively.
