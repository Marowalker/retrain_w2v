In
this study, to develop an organic/inorganic synergistic flame
retardant and to reduce the dosage and cost of flame retardants, organic/inorganic
synergistic flame retardants, hexakis(4-boronic acid-phenoxy)-cyclophosphazene
(CP-6B), and magnesium hydroxide (MH) were chosen. The flame retardant
properties of CP-6B/MH in epoxy resin (EP) were discussed. EP/CP-6B/MH
had better flame retardancy and heat resistance compared with EP/CP-6B
and EP/MH. A limiting oxygen index of EP/3.0%CP-6B/0.5%MH of 31.9%
was achieved, and vertical burning V-0 rating was achieved. Compared
with EP, the cone calorimeter dates of EP/CP-6B/MH decreased. CP-6B/MH
inhibited combustion and did little to damage mechanical properties.
Besides, the flame retardant mechanism was studied by scanning electron
microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction,
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and pyrolysis–gas
chromatography–mass spectrometry. CP-6B/MH exerted good synergistic
effects.

1 Introduction
Traditional
halogen-containing fire retardants are widely used
due to their good compatibility with materials and high flame retardancy.1−3 However, halogen-containing flame retardants release a large number
of toxic substances and corrosive smoke during combustion.4−6 Halogen-free, environmentally friendly, low-toxic, and low-cost
flame retardants are the focus of flame retardant research.7−12

Intumescent flame retardants (IFRs) are currently the research
hotspots in the field of flame retardancy.13−20 In general, IFR systems are mainly composed of three parts.21−23 The acid source produces acidic substances, which can catalyze the
dehydration and carbonization of carbon sources; the carbon source
produces a highly stable char layer under acid catalysis to protect
internal resin; the decomposition of the gas source releases non-flammable
gas, dilutes oxygen and volatiles, decreases heat conductivity, and
enhances insulation effects during burning.24,25 However, to obtain good flame-retardant properties, a very large
amount of traditional IFR is used in the substrate, which impair the
mechanical properties of the material.26,27

An inorganic
flame retardant is a halogen-free fire retardant with
low toxicity, low smoke, good thermal stability, and abundant resources.28−32 As a typical inorganic flame retardant, magnesium hydroxide (MH)
is preferred in the industry.33,34 The amount of MH added
typically exceeds 50%; the polymer has flame retardant property, which
makes it poorly compatible with the polymer and reduces the polymer’s
mechanical properties.35−37

Most of IFRs are mainly composed of phosphorus
and nitrogen.38−40 In our previous study, organic boron IFRs [2,4,6-tris(4-boronic-2-thiophene)-1,3,5-triazine
(3TT-3BA); 2,4,6-tris(4-boron-phenoxy)-(1,3,5)-triazine (TNB); and
hexakis(4-boronic acid-phenoxy)-cyclophosphazene (CP-6B)] were synthesized.41−44 3TT-3BA, TNB, and CP-6B have good flame retardancy properties. Organic
boron flame retardants can form a covering carbon layer containing
boron to isolate volatiles and air.41−46 It is possible for synergistic flame retardancy of IFR and MH to
enhance the flame retardancy and decrease the amount of MH and IFR
added; thereby, the mechanical properties of the material are not
affected. Many literature studies have reported that the combination
of MH and other IFRs containing phosphorus and nitrogen has successfully
improved the flame retardancy.27,36,37,47−50 However, the total amount of
flame retardants still needs to be reduced, and the report on the
combination of MH and organic boron IFRs was not many.

Epoxy
resin (EP) is widely used engineering material. However,
EP is easily combustible, which limits its wider application.11,12,51−55 To develop organic/inorganic IFRs, EP was used as
substrate material in this article. The synergistic flame retardant
effect of CP-6B/MH on EP was studied, and the flame retardancy mechanism
was discussed.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Thermogravimetry and Differential Thermogravimetry
Analyses
Figure 1 shows the thermogravimetry (TG) (a) and differential thermogravimetry
analyses (DTG) (b) curves of the EP samples. Their characteristic
thermal performance data are shown in Table S1 (Supporting Information). The residual char yield of pure EP
was the lowest. Compared to pure EP, the degradation of EP/3%CP-6B
was advanced because CP-6B decomposed to form a protective carbon
layer. EP/3%CP-6B exhibited two decomposition peaks. The first stage
reflected the main decomposition process in which CP-6B decomposed
in advance to form the char layer containing the B–O–C
structure. In the second stage, the char layer was further degraded
to form a high stability char layer. The carbon residue of EP/3%CP-6B
at 800 °C was 18.0%. When MH was added to EP/3% CP-6B, the initial
decomposition temperature of EP/CP-6B/MH increased. Therefore, MH
could improve the heat resistance of CP-6B. The thermal degradation
of EP/CP-6B/MH had only one decomposition stage, and the residual
char yield of EP/3%CP-6B/0.5%MH at 800 °C (W800°C) reached 21.8%. This result showed the formation
of a stable carbon layer containing MgO when CP-6B and MH were added
together. This layer protected the composite from further degradation
and enhanced the heat stability of the resin. CP-6B and MH demonstrated
good synergistic flame retardant effects.

for EP samples.

2.2 Limiting
Oxygen Index and Vertical Burning
(UL 94)
Table 1 shows the limiting oxygen index (LOI) and UL 94 rating of the EP
samples. When adding 3 wt % MH and 3 wt % CP-6B to EP separately,
the LOI of the EP sample increased from 22.8 to 25.2 and 30.8%, respectively.
When MH and CP-6B were added together, EP/CP-6B/MH samples exhibited
good flame retardant properties. The LOI of EP/3%CP-6B/0.5%MH attained
31.9%, and the UL 94 combustion grade reached V-0 without dripping.
This result was ascribed to the synergistic effect of CP-6B and MH.
CP-6B catalyzed EP to generate an intumescent char layer, and MH released
water to form MgO. The char layer containing MgO could protect internal
EP and prevent the formation of dripping. Simultaneously, the decomposition
of MH produced water vapor, and the decomposition of CP-6B released
nonflammable gases, which could dilute flammable volatiles and air.

2.3 Cone Calorimeter Tests
Cone calorimeter
can evaluate the combustion properties of flame retardant materials.
The relevant combustion parameters of EP samples are summarized in Table 2.

Table 2 Cone Calorimeter Data of EP Samples
sample	pk-HRR (kW/m2)	THR (MJ/m2)	av-EHC (MJ/kg)	FGI (kW/(m2·K))	av-MLR (g/s)	residual
char yield (%)	
EP	1091	83	24.0	12.8	0.76	6.8	
EP/3%MH	751	80	23.3	8.8	0.75	7.8	
EP/3%CP-6B	608	71	21.0	6.1	0.53	14.6	
EP/3%CP-6B/0.5%MH	535	67	19.9	4.1	0.34	17.2	
The effective heat combustion (EHC) represents the
combustion intensity
of volatile gases in the gas phase. Table 2 shows the average EHC (av-EHC) of the EP
samples. The av-EHC of EP/CP-6B and EP/MH were both lower than that
of pure EP. With the addition of 3 wt % MH, the av-EHC of EP sample
decreased from 24.0 to 23.3 MJ/kg. With the addition of 3 wt % CP-6B,
the av-EHC of EP sample decreased from 24.0 to 21.0 MJ/kg. When 3
wt % CP-6B and 0.5 wt % MH were added simultaneously, the av-EHC of
EP/3%CP-6B/0.5%MH was only 19.9 MJ/kg. The decomposition of CP-6B
and MH generated a large amount of nonflammable gases and water vapor,
which could reduce the contact of flammable volatiles with air. CP-6B
promoted EP to produce an intumescent carbon layer. MH decomposed
endothermically and released water to form MgO. The char layer-containing
MgO inhibited internal resin decomposition. Table 2 shows the fire growth index (FGI) of EP
samples. FGI can assess the fire hazard of substrates. The FGI values
of EP/3%MH and EP/3%CP-6B were 68.8 and 47.7% of that of pure EP,
respectively. When 3 wt % CP-6B and 0.5 wt % MH were added together,
the FGI of EP/3%CP-6B/0.5%MH was only about 32.0% of that of pure
EP, thereby indicating that CP-6B/MH could control the spread of fire
and reduce the fire intensity.

Figure 2 shows the
heat release rate (HRR) and total heat release (THR) curves of EP
samples. The peak HRR (pk-HRR) of pure EP, EP/3%MH, EP/3%CP-6B, and
EP/3%CP-6B/0.5%MH were 1091, 751, 608, and 535 kW/m2, respectively.
The THR of pure EP, EP/3%MH, EP/3%CP-6B, and EP/3%CP-6B/0.5%MH were
83, 80, 71, and 67 MJ/m2, respectively. Figure 3 shows the mass loss curves
of EP samples. When 3 wt % CP-6B and 0.5 wt % MH were simultaneously
added, the av-MLR of EP/3%CP-6B/0.5%MH was the lowest, and the residual
char yield of EP/3%CP-6B/0.5%MH was the highest. These observations
were due to the fact that the char layer-containing MgO and the nonflammable
gases exerted a protective effect on EP.

Figure 2 (a) HRR and (b) THR curves
of EP samples.

Figure 3 Mass loss curves from
cone calorimetry tests for EP samples.

Figure 4 shows
the
digital photos after the cone calorimetry tests. Pure EP was almost
decomposed completely. When 3 wt % MH was added, a small amount of
char for EP/3%MH was observed, but most of the residue was MgO powder.
With the addition of 3 wt % CP-6B, the char of EP/3%CP-6B was intumescent
and hard, but there were a few small holes. After adding 3 wt % CP-6B
and 0.5 wt % MH together, the char of EP/3%CP-6B/0.5%MH was continuous
intumescent char layer, and the surface was surrounded by MgO coating.
The protective layer formed a barrier to isolate oxygen and prevent
heat exchange. Thus, EP/3%CP-6B/0.5%MH showed good flame retardancy.

(c) EP/3%CP-6B, and (d) EP/3%CP-6B/0.5%MH.

2.4 Scanning Electron Microscopy
Figure 5 shows the scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images of the residual of EP/3%MH and EP/3%CP-6B/0.5%MH
after cone calorimeter tests. The residual char of pure EP44 had a lot of holes, and this carbon layer had
no protective effect on EP. With the addition of 3 wt % MH, the residual
char of EP/3%MH still contained large holes. With the addition of
3 wt % CP-6B, the residual char of EP/3%CP-6B44 was compact with only a few holes. However, when 3 wt % CP-6B and
0.5 wt % MH were added together, the residual char of EP/3%CP-6B/0.5%MH
was a continuous carbon layer without holes and cracks. The continuous
char layer could prevent air from entering the internal resin and
slow the exchange of combustion heat. Therefore, EP/3%CP-6B/0.5%MH
showed better flame retardancy than the other samples. CP-6B and MH
demonstrated good synergistic flame retardant effects.

chars from (a) EP/3%MH (×200) and (b)
EP/3%CP-6B/0.5%MH (×200).

2.5 Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy
The elemental analysis data of residual sample were shown in Table
S2 (Supporting Information); EP/3%MH residual
char showed higher oxygen and magnesium contents than pure EP residual
char. These finding showed that the char layer contained MgO. EP/3%CP-6B
showed higher phosphorus, nitrogen, and oxygen compared with pure
EP, thereby indicating that the char layer contained phosphorus, nitrogen,
and oxygen. When 3 wt % CP-6B and 0.5 wt % MH were added together,
EP/3%CP-6B/0.5%MH showed higher oxygen, magnesium, phosphorus, and
nitrogen contents compared with pure EP sample. EP/3%CP-6B/0.5%MH
formed a more stable carbon layer during combustion, which had higher
heat and oxidation resistance.

2.6 Morphologies
of EP Samples at Different Temperatures
Figure 6 shows the
photographs of EP samples that were stored at various temperatures
for 15 min in a muffle furnace. Pure EP had changed color at 250 °C,
and little residual char was observed in the crucible at 650 °C.
The change trend of EP/3%MH was basically the same as that of pure
EP. The final carbon residue from EP/3%MH was only 0.61 wt %, which
contained white MgO powder. This finding showed that the flame retardancy
of MH was low, and low loads of MH did not result in good flame retardancy.
The EP/3%CP-6B formed a continuous carbon layer at 400 °C, and
the carbon residue yield of EP/3%CP-6B at 650 °C was 1.56 wt
%. When 3 wt % CP-6B and 0.5 wt % MH were added together, EP/3%CP-6B/0.5%MH
still retained its shape at 450 °C and generated a continuous
carbon layer at 500 °C. The carbon residue yield of EP/3%CP-6B/0.5%MH
at 650 °C was 3.99 wt %. The EP/3%CP-6B/0.5% MH had the highest
thermal stability, and CP-6B and MH exerted a synergistic flame retardant
effect.

for 15 min in a muffle furnace: (a) pure EP, (b) EP/3%MH, (c) EP/3%CP-6B,
and (d) EP/3%CP-6B/0.5%MH.

2.7 Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
Figure 7 shows the
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra of residual
chars. The decomposition of pure EP was extremely thorough.44 When 3 wt % MH was added, EP was also decomposed
thoroughly. However, many infrared absorption peaks were found from
residual EP/3%CP-6B and residual EP/3%CP-6B/0.5%MH. These peaks revealed
that some structures were still retained after EP/3%CP-6B/0.5%MH decomposed.

(c) EP/3%CP-6B/0.5%MH.

2.8 X-ray Diffraction
In a previous study,44 CP-6B was found to form intumescent char layers
containing BPO4 when added to EP. Figure 8 shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern
of the residual EP/3%CP-6B/0.5%MH. The residual EP/3%CP-6B/0.5%MH
had a diffraction peaks at 2θ = 24.5°, which was BPO4. The residual EP/3%CP-6B/0.5%MH also contained MgO, and its
corresponding diffraction peaks was at 2θ = 42.9° and 62.3°.
These results indicated that residual EP/3%CP-6B/0.5%MH contained
BPO4 and MgO.

2.9 Pyrolysis–Gas
Chromatography–Mass
Spectrometry
Figure 9 is the PY–GC–MS curves of pure EP44 and EP/3%CP-6B/0.5%MH at 450 (a) and 700 °C
(b). The structures corresponding to the peaks in the mass spectrum
of EP/3%CP-6B/0.5%MH are shown in Table S3 (Supporting Information). After the polymer material was ignited, the chain
reaction occurred in the gas phase. During the combustion process,
the EP polymer chain was broken, and a large amount of active radicals
H• and •OH were generated. These
active radicals continued to promote the chain scission of the EP
molecular chain and accelerate decomposition. Therefore, the amount
and intensity of pure EP vapor volatiles were very high. The small
molecule radicals generated by the decomposition of CP-6B could capture
H• and •OH to form stable amines,
alcohols, and phenols; and MgO could also adsorb free radicals. Therefore,
the amount and intensity of EP/3%CP-6B/0.5%MH vapor volatiles were
much lower than pure EP.

at (a) 450 and
(b) 700 °C.

2.10 Flame
Retardant Mechanism
Figure 10 is the flame retardant
model of EP sample. When only MH was added, it decomposed endothermically,
released water and generated MgO. MgO could form a physical protective
layer of MgO residue through physical accumulation. However, the continuous
decomposition of the internal substrate, which released heat and volatile
gases, caused the external MgO carbon layer to crack. These cracks
led to the reduction in heat insulation and oxygen isolation efficiency
of the carbon layer. Thus, MH required a high amount of load to achieve
intense flame retardancy. When only CP-6B was added, it could promote
the formation of shrinkable intumescent carbon layers; moreover, no
cracks were formed, but several small holes were observed. By contrast,
when CP-6B and MH were added together, CP-6B first catalyzed the formation
of a shrinkable carbon layer, and MgO produced by MH decomposition
was dispersed, forming a compact and continuous intumescent char layer
without cracks and holes. Therefore, better flame retardant properties
were obtained with the synergistic effect of CP-6B and MH.

model of CP-6B and MH, (a) EP/MH, (b) EP/CP-6B,
and (c) EP/CP-6B/MH.

2.11 Mechanical Property
Table 3 shows the mechanical properties
of EP samples. With the addition of 3 wt % CP-6B, the impact energy
and impact strength of EP sample increased. EP was a thermosetting
resin with high strength and easy to crack under stress. CP-6B could
absorb impact energy, adding a small amount of CP-6B could improve
the toughness of EP sample. When 3 wt % MH was added, the impact energy
of EP sample decreased from 0.31 to 0.24 J, and the impact strength
of EP sample decreased from 7.7 to 6.1 kJ·m–2. This phenomenon indicated that MH would damage the mechanical properties
of EP materials. The impact energy of EP/3%CP-6B/0.5%MH was 0.39 J,
and the impact strength of EP/3%CP-6B/0.5%MH was 9.7 kJ·m–2. Therefore, CP-6B and a small amount of MH could
effectively suppress combustion without decreasing the mechanical
strength.

Table 3 Mechanical Properties of EP Samples
samples	impact energy
(J)	impact strength (kJ·m–2)	
EP	0.31	7.7	
EP/3%MH	0.24	6.1	
EP/3%CP-6B	0.55	13.8	
EP/3%CP-6B/0.5%MH	0.39	9.7	
EP/3%CP-6B/1.0%MH	0.32	7.9	
EP/3%CP-6B/1.5%MH	0.30	7.6	
3 Conclusions
To develop
organic/inorganic IFRs and reduce the dosage and cost
of flame retardants, MH and an organic compound containing phosphorus,
nitrogen, and boron, namely, CP-6B, were selected. The decomposition
of CP-6B generated shrinkable intumescent char layers and nonflammable
gases. MH could decompose endothermically and release water, and it
formed a physical protective layer of MgO residue. Results showed
that when CP-6B and MH were added together, the flame retardancy of
EP was better than when only one of them was added. The results demonstrated
that the flame retardant properties of CP-6B and MH induced good synergistic
effects.
