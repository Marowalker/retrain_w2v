Silver-based products are becoming popular as antimicrobial
agents
because of the failure of antibiotics available for tackling the drug-resistant
microbial strains. As silver is well tolerated by normal human cells,
silver complexes have emerged as important antineoplastic agents.
Further, if silver ions are encapsulated within an organic molecule—an
azacorand—it may serve as a better substitute for cisplatin
or other metal complexes. The calix-salen-type corates were synthesized
using silver ions as the template. 5,5′-methylene-bis-salicylaldehyde
was reacted with ethylene diamine in methanol at room temperature
in the presence of silver nitrate. The resultant corand trapped the
silver template in their cavity. The electron-withdrawing and electron-releasing
groups like −NO2, −Br, −C(CH3)3, and −OCH3 were substituted on the
bis-aldehyde to study their effects on the antimicrobial and anticancer
activities of silver corates. The silver corates were found to have
better antimicrobial activity than some of the standard drugs. Bromo-substituted
corate-3, nitro-substituted corate-4, and tert-butyl-substituted
corate-5 were found to be potent antibacterial agents among all. The
bromo-substituted corate-3 was found to be the most potent fungicidal
agent among all silver corates. The result of antineoplastic activity
suggests that unsubstituted corate-1 and bromo-substituted corate-3
are potential candidates to be used as therapeutic molecules for cancer
treatment, which requires further validation.

Introduction
Supramolecular chemistry has gained the
attention of many chemists,
biologists, and pharmacists in the last two decades. Supramolecular
cavitands have been widely used as drug delivery systems,1 chemosensors,2 nano
reaction chambers,3 phase-transfer catalysts,4 and chelating ligands for the extraction of heavy
metals from water.5 One of the various
supramolecular entities, the monocyclic cavitand (better known as
corand) is capable of encapsulating various metal ions to form metal-corates.6 The aza-corand binds silver ion preferentially
over alkali or alkaline earth metal ions.7−10 Silver is known for its medicinal
use at low concentration against Gram-negative bacteria, Gram-positive
bacteria, and fungi.11−15 Silver-based products are becoming popular as antimicrobial agents due to the failure of antibiotics16 available for tackling the drug-resistant microbial
strains. It is proposed that silver ion binds with thiol groups of
the cellular proteins of bacterial cells and arrest the normal cellular
functions.17−20 Silver imparts very less toxicity to humans due to less accumulation
in mammalian cells.21,22 The main challenge in designing
silver-based antimicrobial drugs lies in optimizing slow controlled
and sustained release of silver(I) ions over a while. It is well documented
that prolonged release of silver ions from their complexes or silver
nanoparticles is advantageous over the use of silver salts.23,24 The application of silver nanoparticles in the medicinal field suffers
from major drawbacks of toxicity to human cells and environmental
hazards.18,25 Usage of ligands that bind very firmly to
the silver(I) center may hinder the timely release of silver(I) ions.
The solution to the problem lies in designing supramolecular corands
that encapsulate a silver ion in their cavity. The silver aza-corates
can be developed as an effective antimicrobial agent with fewer side
effects like argyria26 due to complete
encapsulation and minimum exposure of the silver ion.

The clinical
success of cisplatin triggered the syntheses of various
metal complexes for anticancer activity.27 The use of cisplatin is also accompanied by many side effects and
resistance that cause relapses which makes chemotherapy stressful
for the patient suffering from cancer.28 Various other transition metals like ruthenium, rhodium, iridium,
gallium, titanium, and gold have been thought as an alternative to
platinum and their metal complexes have been studied as antineoplastic
agents.29 Silver being well tolerated by
the normal human cells, silver complexes have emerged as important
antineoplastic agents.30 Further, if silver
ion is encapsulated within the organic molecule-an azacorand-may serve
as a better substitute to the cisplatin or other metal complexes.31

Despite huge research being done in the
area of supramolecular
chemistry, the metal corates still have not been well exploited for
their medicinal use, except for few calixarenes which have been identified
as potent cytotoxic and antitumor agents.32 We synthesized the salen-based corands in methanol using a perchlorate
salt of silver ion which acts as the template and also gets bound
within the corand. The corands very well stabilize the silver ion
in +1 state and prevents autooxidation. The toxicity of Ag+ is also thought to get reduced. The silver corates are investigated
for their antimicrobial activities and cytotoxic effects.

Result and Discussion
Being inspired by the clinical
success of silver sulfadiazine,
we designed five different calix-salen-type silver corates to study
their antibacterial and antifungal activities. We also used these
silver corates for the anticancer activity study. The calix-salen-type
corates were synthesized using silver ion as the template.

The
5,5′-methylene-bis-salicylaldehyde was reacted with
ethylene diamine in methanol at room temperature in the presence of
silver nitrate. The resultant corand trapped the silver template in
their cavity. The sodium perchlorate was added to precipitate out
the silver corate-1 in the form of its perchlorate salt (Scheme 1). The electron-withdrawing
and electron-releasing groups like −NO2, −Br,
−C(CH3)3, and −OCH3 were substituted on bis-aldehyde to generate corate-2 to -5 in varying
yields from 23 to 66% to study their effect on antimicrobial and anticancer
activities (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Silver Template-Assisted Synthesis of Corates
The structures of calix-salen silver corates
are established based
on IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and 2D NMR measurements
including DOSY, HSQC, NOESY, and high-resolution mass spectrometry
(HRMS).

The IR spectrum of corate-1 is indicative of its expected
structure.
ν(OH) is found at 3300 cm–1, ν(C=N)
is observed at 1632 cm–1, and ν(C–O)
is observed at 1273 cm–1. Comparison of IR spectrum
of corand-133 with silver corate-1 shows
a shift of ν(C=N) band from 1634 to 1632 cm–1, which reveals the binding of silver ion to the azomethine nitrogens
of corand-1. Further as sharp medium intensity band is observed at
623 cm–1, which confirms the presence of ClO4– as the counter ion (spectra S-1, S-2, Supporting Information).

IH
NMR spectrum of silver corate-1 shows a characteristic
singlet at δ 8.45 corresponding to a proton of imine functionality
Ha coordinated to silver ion. The unbound imine proton
of the respective corand-133 appeared at
δ 8.37 (spectrum S-3, Supporting Information). The downfield shift of imine proton from δ 8.37 to δ
8.34 supports the binding of silver ion with imine nitrogen (spectrum
S-4, Supporting Information). Similar behavior
was observed by methoxy-, bromo-, and tert-butyl-substituted
silver corate-2, -3, and -5 (spectrum S-12, S-17, S-24, Supporting Information). The solubility of nitro-substituted
silver corate-4 is comparatively low, hence imine proton is not well
resolved (spectrum S-21, Supporting Information). Eight different peaks for a total of 34 carbons were observed
in the 13C NMR spectra of corate-1 and -3, which propose
highly symmetrical structure in the solution state (spectrum S-5,
17, Supporting Information). Corate-2 shows
nine different NMR peaks for a total of 38 carbons (spectrum S-13, Supporting Information). NOESY spectrum of corate-1
shows through space interaction between the proton (Ha)
of the imine linkage with the methylene proton (Hg/h) of
the ethylene group suggesting “E” configuration at the
imine bond. The imine proton (Ha) also shows correlation
with aromatic proton (He) ortho to imine group. Methylene
protons (Hf) on the carbon connecting the aromatic rings
show correlation with both the aromatic protons (Hd, He) situated at its ortho position, (spectrum S-7, Supporting Information). With the help of HSQC
spectrum, all the protons on the respective carbons are assigned precisely
(spectrum S-8, Supporting Information).
The structure of [2 + 2] cyclocondensed calix-salen-type corate-1
has been confirmed on the basis of the [M + 1] peak observed for corresponding
corand at m/z 561.245 in the mass
spectrum of silver corate. Here we could not observe the [M + Ag]
peak (spectrum S-10, Supporting Information). The possibility of formation of higher macrocyclic corates like
[3 + 3] or [4 + 4] along with the [2 + 2] cyclocondensed corate is
ruled out on basis of the DOSY spectrum (spectrum S-9, Supporting Information). The spectra of other
silver corates 2, 3, 4, and 5 are also in accordance with its expected
structure (spectrum S-11 to S-26, Supporting Information). The presence of silver ion was confirmed based on EDS (spectrum
S-32, Supporting Information). Cyclic voltammograms
confirmed the presence of silver ion in the +1 state (CV-S-27–CV-S-31, Supporting Information).

Previously, we
have reported the metal-free synthesis of these
calix-salen corands by a high dilution method.33 Here we report single-crystal X-ray structure of methoxy-substituted
corand. The crystal parameters are listed in the table given below
(Table 1). The dimensions
of a cavity of the corand are 12.17 Å × 9.98 Å (Figure 1a,b).

(DMSO)] entrapped in the crystal structure, hence omitted for clarity.
Solvent density was found in the extramolecular cavities formed by
the crystal packing of the corand leaving the intramolecular cavities
empty for encapsulation of other guest molecules.

Antimicrobial Activity of Silver Corates
As some of
the organo-silver compounds form prominent group of antimicrobial
agents, we decided to study antimicrobial activity of the newly synthesized
silver corates and to find out structure–activity relationship,
if present. Antibacterial activities of the silvercorates-1 to -5
were tested by treating with different concentrations of the corates
and measuring the inhibition of bacterial growth. Three Gram-positive
bacterial strains Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtillis, and Streptococcus pyogenes while three Gramnegative bacterial
strains Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella
typhi were chosen to carry out the inhibition study. S. aureus and P. aeruginosa strains are part of the ESKAPE group which are commonly associated
with antibiotic resistance.

Ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and
ciprofloxacin were used as reference drugs. The minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC) of the corates was determined against these bacterial
strains using the broth dilution method. The MIC values of these silver
corates are shown in Table 2.

The silver corates show better inhibitory activity
against Gram-negative
and Gram-positive bacterial strains compare to the standard drug ampicillin
(except corate-1 against S. typhi).
The most prominent inhibitory activity (MIC = 63 μM/mL) is observed
in case of tert-butyl-substituted corate-5 against
the Gram-negative bacterial strain E. coli, which is better than those of the standard drugs ampicillin, ciprofloxacin,
and chloramphenicol (Table 2). The corate-5 is also potent against Gram-positive bacterial
strains S. aureus and S. pyogenus having MIC of 101 μM which is lower
than those of the standard drugs ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, and chloramphenicol
(Table 2). The inhibitory
activity (MIC = 66 μM) against S. typhi and (MIC = 132 μM) against S. aureus of nitro-substituted corate-4 was found to be better than those
of all the standard drugs employed in this study (Table 2). The bromo-substituted corate-3
have higher inhibitory activity (MIC = 92 μM/mL) against Gram-negative
bacterial strain S. typhi and (MIC
= 116 μM) against Gram-positive bacterial strain S. aureus as well as B. subtilis as compared to those of the standard drugs ampicillin, ciprofloxacin,
and chloramphenicol (Table 2).

Structure–Activity Relationship
It is observed
that the unsubstituted silver corate-1 has higher activity against
the Gram-positive bacterial strain S. pyogenus with MIC = 130 μM which is lower than those of the
standard drugs ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, and chloramphenicol. The
substitution on the corate with the lipophilic groups like bromo,
nitro, and tert-butyl makes the corate more potent
toward the Gram-negative bacterial strains. The reason might be the
lipophilicity of the bromo, nitro, and tert-butyl
substituents.35 The cell wall of Gram-negative
bacterial strain is highly lipophilic in nature, which will allow
and enhance the trespassing of the silver ion when enveloped within
the lipophilic carrier. Hence the silver corate-3 and -4 exhibit better
activity toward the Gram-negative bacterial strain S. typhi while corate-5 shows the best activity among
all against E. coli.

The corates
were also screened for their antifungal activity against Candida albicans. The reference drugs used were nystatin
and griseofulvin. Minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) values are
reported in Table 3. All corates are found to have better fungicidal activity as compared
to the standard drug griseofulvin. Among all the silver corates, bromo-substituted
corate-3 has prominent fungicidal activity.

Cytotoxicity Assay
Three different cell lines were
used to measure cytotoxicity of synthesized corates. Cells were exposed
to five different concentrations of corates for 24 h. IC50 value was calculated (Table 4). Among all corates, the unsubstituted corate-1 and bromo-substituted
corate-3 showed effective cytotoxicity on IMR 32 cell lines, that
is, 5.87 ± 0.91 and 5.1 ± 0.86 μM, respectively. On
hepatocarcinoma (HepG2) cell line also, both the compounds showed
IC50 value much lower than cisplatin. After corate-1 and
-3, methoxy-substituted corate-2 and tert-butyl-substituted
corate-5 significantly inhibited the growth of cancerous cells (Figure 3).

Apoptotic Assay
Neuroblastoma cells were treated with
corate-1 and -3 for 24 h. Poly-l-lysine-coated cells were
stained with acredine orange (AO) and ethidium bromide (EtBr) and
observed under fluorescence microscope. Necrotic cells were stained
with EtBr whereas live cells were stained with AO (green fluorescence, Figure 4).

Figure 4 IMR 32 cells stained
by acredine orange and EtBr (A). Untreated
cells (B) cells treated with corate-1 and (C) cells treated with corate-3.
Dual staining is observed in treated cells (red arrow: apoptotic cell).

Cells stained with both stains were apoptotic cells.
Treated cells
showed a dual staining pattern as apoptotic cells show during cell
death. Cells treated with corate-3 showed prominent apoptotic cell
death in comparison to those treated with corate-1.

Gene Expression Study
The transcript level of different
genes was analyzed after treatment with corates. Bax and Bcl2 expression
were estimated as they are important markers for mitochondrial-dependent
cell death.36 Level of Bcl2 expression
was observed to be fold decreased in IMR 32 cells in comparison to
the control. Decrease in fold expression of BCl2 after
exposure was 0.1 and −0.9 in corate-1 and corate-3 compounds,
respectively. Apoptotic marker Bax transcript level was measured to
be fold increased after treatment with corate-1 (1.9-fold increased
in expression) and corate 3 (1.98-fold elevated in expression) as
compare to control. Tumor suppressor gene, p53 transcript level was
also measured and it was expressed as fold elevated which was 2.3-
and 2.67-fold increased in expression for corate-1 and corate-3, respectively.
Corate-3 showed significant modulations in gene expression in comparison
to corate-1 (Figure 5).

Figure 5 Gene expression study on exposure of compound to IMR 32 cells using
RT-PCR.

An increased measure of p53 mRNA expression shows
the antiproliferative
activity of corates. Treatment of cancerous cells with silver corate
increased ROS production which changed the mitochondrial membrane
potential and escorts the cells for programmed cell death.37,38

Conclusion
We have synthesized five different silver
corates with various
substituents like methoxy, bromo, nitro, tert-butyl,
and an unsubstituted one using silver ion template. Bromo-substituted
corate-3, nitro-substituted corate-4, and tert-butyl-substituted
corate-5 were found to be the most potent antibacterial agents among
all. Encapsulation of silver in the lipophilic corands ease its entry
into the cell through the lipophilic cell membrane of Gram-negative
bacteria. It is concluded that the attachment of lipophilic groups
on silver corate increases their activity against Gram-negative bacterial
strains. The bromo-substituted corate-3 was found to be the most potent
fungicidal agent among all silver corates. The IC50 results
indicate that corate-1 and corate-3 are potential candidates for the
development of anticancer drugs. Corate-3 showed significant modulations
in gene expression in comparison to corate-1.

Method
All the chemicals and reagents were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich
and used without further purification. All AR grade or spectroscopic
grade solvents were used. Column chromatography was carried out using
silica-gel (60–120 mesh). Thin-layer chromatography was performed
on precoated silica-gel 60F254 (Merck) aluminum sheets.
Infrared spectra were recorded on PerkinElmer FT-IR 16PC spectrophotometer.1H NMR, 13C NMR, and 2D NMR were recorded on a Bruker
400 MHz NMR spectrophotometer using DMSO-d6. HRMS was recorded from SAIF IIT Chandigarh. Single-crystal X-ray
analysis was recorded on a X Calibur EOS Gemini Diffractometer with
graphite Mo Kα radiation (0.71073 Å). Melting points were
measured in open capillaries and are uncorrected.

5,5′-Methylene-bis-salicylaldehyde
and its derivatives were
prepared according to the earlier reported procedure.33,39

General Synthesis of Silver Corate
Methanol (500 mL)
was placed in a 1 L one-necked round bottom flask equipped with an
addition funnel. 5,5′-Methylene-bisaldehyde (3 mmol) and silver
nitrate (2.6 mmol, 0.83 equiv) were added to the round bottom flask
containing methanol. Ethylene diamine (3.0 mmol, 1 equiv) in methanol
(20 mL) was added dropwise from the addition funnel over 1 h to the
magnetically stirred solution of bis-aldehyde. Stirring was continued
for 2 h. The entire process was carried out in dark. Yellowish turbid
solution was obtained. The precipitate was filtered under vacuum using
hyflosupercel (filter aid). Sodium perchlorate (6.3 mmol, 2 equiv)
in methanol (20 mL) was added dropwise from the addition funnel to
the above filtrate and the reaction mixture was stirred overnight.
The precipitates obtained were filtered, washed with methanol (4 ×
20 mL), and dried under vacuum.

X-ray Diffraction Studies
Diffraction data for corand-2
were collected on an X-calibur, EOS, Gemini diffractometer with graphite
monochromatic Mo Ka radiation (0.71073 Å) All structures were
solved and refined using the Olex2 software and ShelXL refinement
package. Graphics were generated using MERCURY, version 3.9. All structures
were solved by the direct method. CCDC no: CCDC 1917152.

Antimicrobial Activity
Broth dilution method was used
to determine MIC values for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial
strains and to determine MFC values for C. albicans. DMSO was used as the diluent/vehicle to get the desired concentration
of the test compounds to measure their activity against standard bacterial
strains. Silversulfadiazine and ciprofloxacin were the standard antibacterial
drugs used for comparison of MIC values while griseofulvin and nystatin
were used as the standard antifungal drugs for comparison of MFC values.

Mueller Hinton broth was used as the nutrient medium to grow and
dilute the drug (or compound) suspension for the test bacteria. Inoculum
size for test strain was adjusted to 108 CFU [colony forming
unit] per milliliter by comparing the turbidity. The strains were
procured from Institute of Microbial Technology, Chandigarh.

Cytotoxicity Assay
In vitro anticancer activity of
silver corates was carried out against human cancer cell lines. IMR
32 (neuroblastoma cell line), HepG2 and L132 (immortal lung cell line)
were procured from the NCCS, Pune. MTT assay, according to the standard
protocol40 was performed against these
three cells. Cisplatin is one of the effective chemotherapy drugs,
which was used as a reference drug in the present study. Each cell
line used (IMR32, L132, and HepG2) was exposed to different corate
compounds with different concentrations (2, 6, 10, 14, and 18 μM/200
μL) for 24 h. Cells were exposed to silver corate compounds
for 24 h. The relationship between compound concentration and cell
viability was measured to calculate IC50 values, the values
that show 50% inhibition of cell viability.

Gene Expression Study (qRT-PCR)
For analysis of mRNA
transcript variation, cells were treated by silver corates for 24
h. RNA was extracted and quantified by Nanodrop spectrophotometer.
cDNA was synthesized using Bio-Rad iScript cDNA synthesis kit and
used as the template for RT-PCR. The mRNA transcript level of p53,
Bax, and Bcl2 genes were studied. β-actin was used as the reference
gene. Primers of the target gene were designed using BLAST software
of NCBI. The sequence of primers is given here. (p53 primer F: 5′CATAGTGTGGTGGTGCCCTA3′,
R: 5′CACCTCAAAGCTGTTCCGTC3′; Bcl2 primer F: 5′GCCCGAGAACCTAATGGCTT3′,
R: 5′CTCAGGGACTCACTCTGCTG3′; Bax Primer: F: 5′GCCCTTTTGCTTCAGGGTTT3′,
R: 5′GGAAAAAGACCTCTCGGGGG3′; and β-actin primer
F-5′ CCACCATGTACCCTGGCATT3′, R: 5′ CGCTCAGGAGGAGCAATGAT3′).
Real Time PCR reactions were performed using Power up SYBR Green mix
(invitrogen). Calculation of relative gene expression (normalized
by β-actin) was analyzed according to the fold difference in
expression using the 2–ΔΔCT method.41

Cell Death Analysis
AO and EtBr were used to observe
cell death by dual fluorescence staining mechanism. Poly-l-lysine-coated coverslip was kept in 6-well plates on which IMR 32
cells were seeded and incubated overnight for adhesion in a CO2 incubator. IMR 32 cells were treated with silver corates
for 24 h. Cells were stained by AO/EtBr (4:1) for 20 min in dark at
room temperature. Cells were washed with PBS and observed under a
fluorescence microscope.
