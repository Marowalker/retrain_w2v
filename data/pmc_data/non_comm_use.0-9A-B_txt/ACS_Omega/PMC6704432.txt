Faceted β-SnWO4 microcrystals are prepared with different morphologies including
tetrahedra, truncated tetrahedra, truncated octahedra, and short-spiked
and long-spiked spikecubes. All of these morphologies are prepared
with comparable experimental conditions via microwave-assisted synthesis
of high-boiling alcohols (the so-called polyol method). The decisive
parameters for controlled formation of one or the other morphology
of faceted β-SnWO4 microcrystals are studied and
discussed, including microwave-assisted heating, Sn(OH)2 as the Sn2+ reservoir, the temperature of particle nucleation,
the temperature of particle growth, and the concentration of the starting
materials. Morphology and crystallinity are characterized by scanning
electron microscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, UV–vis, and
Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. Finally, the photocatalytic
properties of all obtained faceted microcrystals—tetrahedra,
truncated tetrahedra, truncated octahedra, cubes, and short-spiked
and long-spiked spikecubes—are exemplarily compared with regard
to the photocatalytic decomposition of rhodamine B and the influence
of the respective surface crystal planes.

Introduction
Prerequisites for efficient
photocatalysts essentially comprise a high specific surface area as
well as high crystallinity.1,2 A high specific surface
area ensures fast diffusion to and fast conversion of the reactants
at the photocatalyst surface. High crystallinity guarantees efficient
generation of electron–hole pairs after light absorption at
the lowest level of defect-related loss processes. Optimizing these
features causes conflicting issues and either results in high-surface
nanoparticles or low-defect single crystals. Faceted microcrystals
turned out as the most promising compromise, exposing highly reactive
crystal facets.1,2 The reactivity of specific facets,
however, can differ dramatically, e.g., due to different redox activity
or different adsorption/desorption processes of reactants/products.

The realization of faceted microcrystals needs efficient control
of nucleation and growth processes, including precise adjustment of
the decisive reaction parameters (e.g., concentrations, temperature)
and use of selected surface-active agents to block or to support the
growth of specific crystal facets.1,2 So far, tailored
growth and formation mechanism of faceted nano- and microcrystals
were most widely studied for zerovalent metals.3,4 In
comparison to metals, much less is known regarding the growth of faceted
metal-oxide microcrystals. Most often, non-Platonian shapes such as
rods, plates, flakes, lenses, flowers, etc. were described. With regard
to Platonian shapes such as tetrahedra, octahedra, or cubes, typically,
only a single faceted morphology can be obtained at specific conditions
of synthesis (e.g., ZnO, Cu2O, Ag2O, TiO2, CeO2, Fe2O3).5−9 Obtaining faceted microcrystals with different Platonian shapes
at comparable conditions of reaction is even more limited and predominately
related to Cu2O, TiO2, MoOx, CeO2, and SrTiO3.10−15 In particular, tetrahedral shapes, to our surprise, were yet rarely
described, for instance, in the case of CdSe or Ag3PO4.16,17

With regard to visible-light-driven
metal-oxide photocatalysts, β-SnWO418,19 recently turned out as an interesting material and promising addition
to BiVO4,20,21 as an intensely studied visible-light-driven
photocatalyst, and anatase-TiO2,22 as the most widely studied but UV-excited photocatalyst. Yellow
β-SnWO4 with a direct band gap of 2.7 eV, in fact,
is a high-temperature modification (>670 °C)18,23 that we could reliably prepare as a metastable compound near room
temperature only recently.18,24 So far, synthesis of
high-boiling, multivalent alcohols (so-called polyol synthesis)25 only resulted in high-surface but low-crystallinity
nanoparticles that nevertheless turned out promising for photodynamic
treatment of tumor cells.26 Moreover, faceted
dodecahedral β-SnWO4 microcrystals were realized
in low quantities by microemulsion synthesis.18 Finally, we could recently realize β-SnWO4 with
a unique spikecube-type morphology.27

Motivated by the peculiar shape of the β-SnWO4 spikecubes,
we intended to examine the conditions of nucleation and growth more
detailedly. Moreover, we aimed at understanding the conditions of
growth and eventually realizing further faceted shapes of β-SnWO4. As a result, widespread faceted morphologies are selectively
grown for the first time, including tetrahedra, truncated tetrahedra,
truncated octahedra, cubes, and spikecubes. These faceted microcrystals
are obtained by microwave-assisted polyol synthesis. Finally, the
photocatalytic activity is conceptually studied by decomposition of
rhodamine B, and it clearly evidences a facet-depending performance.

Results
and Discussion
Synthesis and Crystallinity
Crystallinity
is a prerequisite for morphology control and the formation of faceted
microcrystals, in general. Aiming at the yellow, cubic β-SnWO4, two fundamental limitations for controlled crystal growth
are relevant. On the one hand, β-SnWO4 remains amorphous
if the temperature of particle nucleation and particle growth is too
low. High temperatures, on the other hand, favor the formation of
the thermodynamically more stable red, orthorhombic α-SnWO4 phase. Based on Jeitschko’s first report on the crystal
structure,23 we already made many efforts
on obtaining faceted microcrystals of the metastable β-SnWO4. Low-temperature synthesis indeed resulted in well-defined
but low crystalline, spherical nanoparticles in a size range of 5–20
nm.18,26 Synthesis of multivalent, high-boiling alcohols
recently allowed realizing the so-called β-SnWO4 spikecubes,
i.e., cubes on whose surfaces spikes were grown in addition.27 The availability of this unique morphology also
promises the option to obtain further interesting morphologies.

Based on our previous experiments, first of all, we have concentrated
on how to crystallize β-SnWO4 based on the fact that
crystallinity is a prerequisite for obtaining specific morphologies
and faceted microcrystals. For all experiments, SnCl2·2H2O and Na2WO4·2H2O were
used as the starting materials. Na2WO4 is essential
due to the presence of tetrahedrally coordinated [WO4]2–, which is also the building unit in β-SnWO4.18 In contrast, only α-SnWO4 was obtained as the crystalline phase at any temperature
if octahedrally coordinated (WO6) units were available
in the starting material (e.g., (NH4)6Mo7O24).18 Moreover, diethylene
glycol (DEG) was used as the solvent. Finally, the amount of water
as a mineralizer was kept constant at 6 mL of water per 150 mL of
DEG (see the Experimental Section). Based
on these fixed conditions, the concentration of the starting materials
and especially the temperature treatment were modified (Table 1).

spikecubes (short-spiked)	80	170	24	1	
spikecubes (long-spiked)	80	180	24	1	
With regard
to the temperature, it needs to be noticed that only β-SnWO4 nanoparticles of low crystallinity were obtained if the temperature
was <170 °C. Below this threshold, scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) clearly indicates the presence of spherical nanoparticles with
a diameter <100 nm (Figure 1). X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), moreover, indicates the
low crystallinity with only the most intense Bragg peak being observable
with a low intensity and a broad peak width (Figure 1). Thus, a temperature ≥170 °C
is indispensible for crystallization. Temperatures >220 °C,
however, result in decomposition of DEG, which proceeds faster with
higher temperature and longer time of heating.25 As a result, the temperature window for successful crystallization
and controlled growth of faceted β-SnWO4 microcrystals
is limited to ≥170 and ≤220 °C.

Indeed all faceted β-SnWO4 microcrystals,
including tetrahedra, truncated tetrahedra, truncated octahedra, and
short-spiked and long-spiked spikecubes were obtained in the 170–220
°C temperature window. Prior to the detailed elucidation of the
growth conditions, the faceted β-SnWO4 microcrystals
were also characterized by optical spectroscopy (UV–vis) and
Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy (Figure 2). Since the respective spectra
were similar for all faceted microcrystals, β-SnWO4 tetrahedra are exemplarily illustrated here. According to UV–vis
spectra, β-SnWO4 microcrystals show the expected
absorption in the near ultraviolet to blue spectral regime (<500
nm, Figure 2a). Based
on Tauc plots, band gaps of 2.7–2.9 eV were determined (Supporting
Information (SI): Figure S1), which is
in good agreement with the previously reported data of β-SnWO4 spikecubes (2.9 eV).27 Photoluminescence
spectra, furthermore, exclude fluorescence as a relevant competitive
loss process for photocatalysis (SI: Figure S2). FT-IR spectra of β-SnWO4 indicate vibrations
at 1050–700 cm–1 (Figure 2b), which can be assigned to the orthotungstate
anion [WO4]2– and which compare well
with Na2WO4 as a reference.28 Additional vibrations relate to adsorbed water (ν(O–H):
3400–3300 cm–1, δ(H2O):
1650 cm–1). Even more important, FT-IR spectra of
the β-SnWO4 microcrystals did not show any vibrations
related to adhered DEG after purification (Figure 2b), which is highly relevant for photocatalysis
since adhered, surface-active molecules could block the active surface
and thus reduce the catalytic activity. The fact that the optical
properties, band gap, and surface functionalization are identical
for all faceted β-SnWO4 microcrystals within the
experimental significance is highly important for the latter comparison
of the photocatalytic properties.

as a representative example of microcrystals; for other morphologies
see Figure S1 in the SI): (a) UV–vis
spectrum; (b) FT-IR spectra (Na2WO4 as a reference).

Morphology Control
The strategy to obtain faceted β-SnWO4 microcrystals
comprises two sequential steps. First of all, the nucleation of β-SnWO4 was initiated at the nucleation temperature TN (Table 1, Figure 3b). Thereafter,
crystallization and controlled growth proceed at the growth temperature TG (Table 1, Figure 3c). TN was adjusted with regard to two aspects. On
the one hand, nucleation as an endothermal process can be supported
by elevated temperatures, resulting in a TN value higher than room temperature. Since Na2WO4·2H2O is only completely dissolved in DEG at temperatures
>70 °C (Figure 3a), TN was typically set to 80 °C.
At this temperature, moreover, the injection of aqueous SnCl2·2H2O did not cause any retardation of boiling. Here,
it needs to be noticed that dissolving SnCl2·2H2O in water at neutral pH results in a suspension of Sn(OH)2 (Figure 3a;
SI: Figure S3). However, the addition of
a Sn(OH)2 suspension turned out to be essential for subsequent
controlled growth. After injection of the aqueous Sn(OH)2 suspension into the solution of Na2WO4·2H2O in DEG, not all Sn2+ is instantaneously available
for the nucleation of β-SnWO4, since Sn(OH)2 dissolves only slowly and remains in the suspension as the Sn2+ reservoir. In terms of the LaMer–Dinegar model,29 thus, the supersaturation is kept low and results
in a low nucleation rate of β-SnWO4.

Figure 3 Schematic illustration
of the microwave-assisted growth of faceted β-SnWO4 microcrystals: (a) solution of Na2WO4 in DEG;
(b) nucleation of β-SnWO4 nanoparticles subsequent
to the injection of an aqueous Sn(OH)2 suspension at the
nucleation temperature TN (Table 1); (c) microwave-assisted growth
of faceted β-SnWO4 microcrystals at the growth temperature TG (Table 1).

Subsequent to the nucleation of
β-SnWO4, crystallization and faceted growth were
performed at 170 °C ≥ TG ≤
220 °C (Table 1, Figure 3c). Since
Sn(OH)2 is still available as an Sn2+ reservoir,
its proceeding dissolution leads to continuous growth of the β-SnWO4 nuclei. According to the LaMer–Dinegar model,29 the exothermal growth reaction should preferentially
be performed at lower temperature than the nucleation (i.e., <80
°C). High temperatures (≥170 °C), however, are essentially
needed for crystallization. These conflicting issues were addressed
by fast, microwave-assisted heating from TN to TG (Figure 3c). Both measures together—slow dissolution
of Sn(OH)2 and fast microwave-assisted heating—guarantee
for tailored growth. The slow dissolution of Sn(OH)2 also
provides a sufficient amount of water as a mineralizer even at high
temperature (≥170 °C). Finally, it needs to be noticed
that the temperature for crystallization and the duration of heating
are closely correlated. Thus, 2 h of heating are required at 170 °C
whereas only 15 min are sufficient at 200 °C (Table 1). DEG as a coordinating solvent
gurantees sufficient surface stabilization of the growing β-SnWO4 microcrystals. The proceeding growth of the microcrystals
can be followed even by the naked eye. After finishing the nucleation,
the yellow color of the β-SnWO4 suspension brightens
up, which originates from the high reflectivity of the microcrystal
surface facets (Figure 3b,c).

Based on the general consideration of the synthesis strategy,
the first parameter to be modified for controlled growth relates to
the injection of the Sn(OH2) suspension and TN. Accordingly, tetrahedra and truncated tetrahedra were
obtained at TN = 80 °C (Table 1, Figure 4a), whereas truncated octahedra were formed
at a TN of 200–220 °C (Table 1, Figure 4b). In terms of the crystal
facets, the {111} crystal plane is obviously preferred over the {100}
crystal plane at low temperatures. According to Ostwald’s step
rule, therefore, the {111} crystal plane has to be considered as more
reactive than the {100} crystal plane.

images for each sample).

As a second parameter, the concentration of the starting
materials turned out to be useful for facet engineering (Figure 5). At low concentration
(5 mmol/L), β-SnWO4 tetrahedra only exposing {111}
crystal planes were obtained (Figure 5a,d). In few cases, moreover, twinned tetrahedral growth
was observed, resulting in so-called star tetrahedra (Figure 5f). Upon increasing the concentration
(17 mmol/L), {100} crystal planes occur in addition to {111} crystal
planes, which results in truncated tetrahedra (Figure 5b,e). Finally, a further increase of the
concentration of the starting materials (24 mmol/L) leads to β-SnWO4 cubes and spikecubes (Figure 5c). Here, the initial cubes expose {100} crystal facets
only. At this concentration, the dissolution of Sn(OH)2 obviously provides more Sn2+ than is removed from the
solution by crystal growth. As a result, additional SnWO4 nuclei are formed that adhere on the surface of the already existing
cubes. The hindered growth of these surface-adhered nuclei thereafter
allows only one edge of a new cube to grow, which results in spikes.

materials according to SEM images ((d, e) overview images; (f) star
tetrahedra occur with about 1–3% in samples of β-SnWO4 tetrahedra).

The length of the spikes can be controlled by the time left
for growth at TG as the third relevant
parameter (Figure 6). If the time at 170 °C was limited to 2 h, followed by rapid
cooling to room temperature, almost no spikes occur on the surface
of the β-SnWO4 cubes (Figure 6a). Rapid cooling was performed by extracting
certain volume (5 mL) of the suspension and subsequent injection into
water (10 mL) at room temperature. In the case of slow natural cooling
to room temperature (about 60 min), the spikes become longer and result
in short-spiked spikecubes (Figure 6b). If the growth of the spikes started at a higher
temperature (180 °C), followed by slow natural cooling, finally,
long-spiked spikecubes were realized (Figure 6c).

short-spiked (b) and long-spiked (c) β-SnWO4 spikecubes
depending on the cooling procedure according to SEM images (overview
and detailed images for each sample).

Taken together, the growth of β-SnWO4 starts
with {111} crystal planes resulting in tetrahedra. If the growth proceeds
for a longer period, the {100} crystal planes become dominating, which
results in truncated tetrahedra and thereafter in cubes. If growth
and nucleation are parallel, then nuclei adhere on the existing cubes
and grow into spikecubes. If, in contrast, the nucleation was already
performed at high temperature (220 °C)—thus at high activation
energy—{111} and {100} directly occur in parallel, resulting
in the growth of truncated octahedra. Hence, the faceted microcrystals
follow a well-controlled growth pattern.

Photocatalytic Evaluation
To evaluate the properties of the faceted β-SnWO4 microcrystals, photocatalysis is an obvious tool. To allow a direct
comparison of the differently shaped microcrystals, the experiments
were performed at identical conditions. Thus, identical concentrations
of the respective β-SnWO4 microcrystals (0.18 g/L)
were suspended in water, and identical concentrations of zwitterionic
rhodamine B (RhB, 0.20 mg/L) were added. RhB was selected, on the
one hand, since its absorption (500–600 nm, SI: Figure S4) is different from the absorption of
β-SnWO4 (<500 nm, Figure 2). On the other hand, the adhesion of the
zwitterionic RhB on the photocatalyst surface is independent from
eventual charging of the respective surface of the photocatalyst.
After adjusting the respective suspensions, the absorption of RhB
at λRhB = 554 nm was continuously monitored under
artificial daylight (AM 1.5G solar light, 100 mW/cm2) (Figure 7). First of all,
the autophotolysis of RhB (in the absence of any photocatalyst) was
verified and showed no considerable effect within the significance
of the experiment. With regard to the faceted β-SnWO4 microcrystals, cubes and truncated octahedra show the lowest activity
followed by truncated tetrahedra and long-spiked spikecubes (Figure 7). By far, the highest
photocatalytical activity is observed for the tetrahedra.

Figure 7 Photocatalytic

0.18 g/L; β-SnWO4 in all cases with a concentration
of 0.20 mg/L).

To explain the different
photocatalytic performance of the faceted β-SnWO4 microcrystals, first of all, it needs to be considered that several
conditions were more-or-less identical, including the concentration
of β-SnWO4 and RhB as well as the crystallinity,
optical absorption, and band gap of the microcrystals (Figure 2; SI: Figures S1 and S2). Moreover, the size of the microcrystals were very
comparable ranging from the truncated octahedra (4–6 μm)
as the smallest to the truncated tetrahedra (10–16 μm)
as the largest species (Table 2). Furthermore, nitrogen sorption measurements were performed
to determine the specific surface according to the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
formalism. As a result, values between 1 and 3 m2/g were
obtained that are again very similar. Finally, the ζ-potential
was measured to evaluate the influence of surface charging. Hence,
all β-SnWO4 microcrystals show negative charging
with values from −24 to −43 mV at pH = 7 (Table 2). Despite certain differences
of the faceted microcrystals, size, specific surface area, and surface
charging cannot explain the observed photocatalytic activity coherently
(Table 2).

With
regard to a great number of very comparable features of the faceted
β-SnWO4 microcrystals that cannot explain the photocatalyic
performance, there is only one decisive aspect left—the nature
of the crystal-surface facets. In fact, all faceted β-SnWO4 microcrystals expose either {111} or {100} crystal planes
or both together.30 Therefore, cubes only
exhibit {100} facets, whereas the tetrahedra only exhibit {111} facets
(Table 2). Truncated
tetrahedra and truncated octahedra expose both {111} and {100} crystal
planes. The relative contribution of each type of crystal plane was
estimated by statistical evaluation of microcrystals on SEM images.
In the case of long-spiked spikecubes, the identification of the surface
crystallography is not easy. The {100} planes of the pristine cubes
are mainly covered by the spikes. The spikes—representing distortedly
grown edges of cubes with (111) orientation—may contain {111}
surfaces, but they will surely exhibit significant stress and strain
due to their curvature. Due to these reactive surface sites and due
to the high specific surface area (in comparison to all other microcrystals),
long-spiked spikecubes show the second highest photocatalytic activity.
Taken together, the photocatalytic activity of the β-SnWO4 microcrystals, however, show a significantly higher activity
of {111} over the {100} crystal surfaces (Table 2). Consequently, the β-SnWO4 tetrahedra exhibit the highest activity for photocatalytic RhB decomposition
of the presented microcrystals at all. Such a higher catalytic activity
of {111} over {100} surfaces was often observed for oxides (e.g.,
Cu2O, γ-Al2O3, Co3O4) and is related to the higher surface energy.31−33

Conclusions
Faceted β-SnWO4 microcrystals
are prepared for the first time with different morphologies such as
tetrahedra, truncated tetrahedra, truncated octahedra, and short-spiked
and long-spiked spikecubes. All of these morphologies are realized
at very comparable experimental conditions via microwave-assisted
synthesis of high-boiling alcohols (the so-called polyol method).
Fundamental prerequisites for controlled growth are the use of Na2WO4·2H2O as a starting material
containing the same tetrahedral (WO4) building unit as
β-SnWO4. The presence of water as mineralizer is
essential as well, even at high temperatures (>150 °C). The
conflicting issues of low temperature favoring controlled crystal
growth and high temperature to guarantee the crystallinity of β-SnWO4 were tackled by using a Sn(OH)2 suspension as
the starting material and the use of microwave-assisted heating. The
slow dissolution of Sn(OH)2 limits the available amount
of Sn2+ during nucleation and serves as a reservoir for
continuous release of Sn2+ during crystal growth. Fast
microwave-assisted heating from the nucleation temperature (80 °C)
to the growth temperature (170–220 °C) guarantees optimal
crystallization and excludes the formation of additional amorphous
nuclei that were obtained in the case of slow heating.

Based
on the aforementioned optimal conditions of nucleation and growth,
decisive parameters for well-controlled growth of faceted β-SnWO4 microcrystals relate to the temperature of particle nucleation,
the temperature, and time of particle growth, as well as the concentration
of the starting materials. All obtained faceted microcrystals—tetrahedra,
truncated tetrahedra, truncated octahedra, cubes, and short-spiked
and long-spiked spikecubes—are exemplarily examined with regard
to the photocatalytic degradation of rhodamine B. Due to the fact
that several features of the microcrystals are very comparable (e.g.,
crystallinity, optical absorption and band gap, size, specific surface
area, ζ-potential, and surface charging), the resulting photocatalytic
performance can be directly correlated with the available crystal
planes. Accordingly, {111} crystal planes clearly outperform {100}
crystal planes, resulting in β-SnWO4 tetrahedra as
the most active microcrystals. As an outlook, these results, on the
one hand, can trigger controlled growth and facet engineering of other
metal oxides and, on the other hand, can support gaining deeper insights
into photocatalytic and catalytic processes in general.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Tin chloride (SnCl2·2H2O, 98%, Sigma-Aldrich), sodium tungstate (Na2WO4·2H2O, 99%, Sigma-Aldrich), and diethylene
glycol (DEG, C4H10O3, 99%, Alfa Aesar)
were used as purchased. The zwitterionic dye rhodamine B (RhB, C28H31ClN2O3, 99%, Acros Organics)
was used as a model dye in photocatalytic dye degradation studies
without further purification.

Synthesis of β-SnWO4 Microcrystals
Na2WO4·2H2O (0.75, 2.6, 3.6 mmol) was added to 150 mL of DEG at the
nucleation temperature of 80 or 200 °C (TN, Table 1)
and stirred for 1 h for complete dissolution. The reaction was performed
under argon flow to prevent any oxidation of DEG. An equimolar amount
of SnCl2·2H2O (0.75, 2.6, 3.6 mmol) was
added in 6 mL of deionized water, resulting in the formation of a
turbid, colorless suspension of Sn(OH)2. This suspension
was injected into the solution of Na2WO4·2H2O in DEG at the nucleation temperature of 80 or 200 °C.
Thereafter, a yellow suspension was immediately formed and indicates
the nucleation of β-SnWO4. The preheated suspension
was then placed in a microwave oven (operating at 1200 W) and heated
fast (1 min) or slow (20 min) (TN → TG, Table 1) to the growth temperature of 170–200 °C (TG, Table 1). This growth temperature was kept for 30–60 min to
support crystal growth. The growth of faceted β-SnWO4 microcrystals is indicated by the brightening of the suspension
originating from increased daylight reflection by the as-formed crystal-surface
facets. Finally, the resulting suspension of faceted β-SnWO4 microcrystals was washed three times with deionized water
by sequential centrifugation and redispersion.

Characterization
Microwave
Oven
Suspensions were heated in round-bottomed flasks with
a magnetic stirrer under argon in a microwave oven (MLS rotaprep,
operating at 1200 W) with a glass fiber (<200 °C) as well
as a pyrometer (>200 °C) for temperature control.

Field
emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Zeiss Supra 40VP equipped
with energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer) was used to determine the
morphology of the as-prepared faceted β-SnWO4 microcrystals.
The microcrystals were suspended in ethanol and dropped and dried
on sliced pieces of a silicium wafer (5 × 5 mm2).

Crystallinity and chemical composition of the faceted β-SnWO4 microcrystals were examined by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD,
Stoe STADI-MP diffractometer, equipped with Ge-monochromator and Cu
Kα1 radiation, 40 kV, 40 mA). About 10 mg of the
microcrystals were deposited onto acetate foil and fixed with scotch
tape.

UV–vis spectra of β-SnWO4 microcrystals
were recorded on a UV 2700 spectrometer (Shimadzu). For this, 4–8
mg of the microcrystals were mixed with 100–120 mg of dried
BaSO4 (spectroscopic grade) and measured against dried
BaSO4 as a reference. The determination of the band gap
was done by the Kubelka–Munk formalism.

Photoluminescence
spectroscopy was conducted with a Horiba Jobin Yvon Spex Fluorolog
3 (Horiba Jobin Yvon, France) equipped with a 450 W Xe-lamp and double
grating excitation and emission monochromator. To detect certain emission,
extremely broad slit widths of 5 nm for the excitation and emission
monochromator were necessary.

Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR)
spectroscopy was performed with a Bruker Vertex 70 FT-IR spectrometer.
For this, the microcrystals were grounded with dried KBr (1–2
mg with 400 mg KBr) and pressed for 15 min under 50 kN.

Volumetric
nitrogen sorption measurements (BEL BELSORP-max) were carried out
at 77 K with nitrogen as an analyte. According to the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
formalism the specific surface area was deduced. Prior to the analysis,
the microcrystalline samples were dried at 120 °C in a vacuum.

To determine the ζ-potential of microcrystal β-SnWO4 suspensions, Zetasizer Nano ZS from Malvern Instruments was
used. About 1 mg of the microcrystals was suspended in water and ultrasonicated
for 5 min prior to the analysis.

Photocatalytic Measurements
The photocatalytic dye degradation was carried out using a Shimadzu
Excalibur measuring head linked with the aforementioned UV–vis
spectrometer. For measurement, the quartz flask contained an aqueous
suspension of the respective faceted β-SnWO4 microcrystals
(20 mg in 110 mL; 0.18 g/L) and the organic dye (0.20 mg/L). This
suspension was continuously mixed with a magnetic stirrer. For photocatalytic
degradation, a LOT Class ABA solar simulator (type LS0805) was applied
that emits a spectrum of AM 1.5G solar light (100 mW/cm2). Prior to illumination, the suspensions were magnetically stirred
in the dark for 1 h to ensure homogenous distribution of the photocatalyst
and the dye. All experiments were carried out at room temperature
and in air. The course of the dye degradation was continuously monitored
by comparing the intensity of the strongest absorption peak of the
dye (λRhB = 554 nm) with the initial absorption at
the beginning of the experiment. The obtained transmission–time
plots were fitted by linear or allometric fits.
