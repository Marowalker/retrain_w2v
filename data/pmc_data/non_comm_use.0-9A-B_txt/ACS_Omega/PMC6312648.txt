The study of the fecal metabolome
is an important area of research
to better understand the human gut microbiome and its impact on human
health and diseases. However, there is a lack of work in examining
the impact of storage and processing conditions on the metabolite
levels of fecal water. Furthermore, there is no universal protocol
used for the storage of fecal samples and preparation of fecal water.
The objective of the current study was to examine the impact of different
storage conditions on fecal samples prior to metabolite extraction.
Fecal samples obtained from nine healthy individuals were processed
under different conditions: (1) fresh samples prepared immediately
after collection, (2) fecal samples stored at 4 °C for 24 h prior
to processing, and (3) fecal samples stored at −80 °C
for 24 h prior to processing. All samples were analyzed using NMR
spectroscopy, multivariate statistical analysis, and repeated measures
ANOVA. Samples which were frozen at −80 °C prior to extraction
of the metabolites exhibited an increase in the number of metabolites
including branched-chain amino acids, aromatic amino acids, and tricarboxylic
acid cycle intermediates. Storage of fecal samples at 4 °C ensured
higher fidelity to freshly processed samples leading to the recommendation
that fecal samples should not be frozen prior to extraction of fecal
water. Furthermore, the work highlights the need to standardize sample
storage of fecal samples to allow for the accurate study of the fecal
metabolome.

Introduction
Several recent papers have highlighted
the importance of the gut
microbiome and its potential role in the human body in functions such
as immune response, physiology, and metabolism.1−6 Imbalance in the gut microbiota, also known as dysbiosis, has been
linked to various diseases including inflammatory bowel disease, atopy,
arthritis, certain cancers, and obesity.7−11 In recent years, the analysis of metabolites in fecal matter has
become an important aspect of the study of functional aspects of the
gut microbiome and its relationship with human health. Metabolomics
has emerged as an important approach for the measurement of metabolites.
Using metabolomics, one can identify and quantify many small molecules
or metabolites in biological samples such as urine, plasma, or feces
using analytical techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
and mass spectrometry coupled to chromatography.12,13 Examination of these metabolites allows detailed metabolic phenotyping
and examination of altered pathways under certain conditions.14,15 To this end, application of metabolomics to fecal samples has enhanced
our understanding of certain conditions and provided evidence for
the link between diet and gut microbiota activity.16−18

However,
despite the increasing application of metabolomics to
fecal samples, there is a lack of studies in examining the stability
of fecal samples. Metabolites and microbial DNA can be degraded in
a fecal sample through oxidation, enzymatic degradation, and hydrolysis
which can occur during fecal collection and storage before the sample
is prepared for analysis.19,20 Owing to this degradation,
it is essential to have an optimized method for fecal collection and
storage in order to reduce degradation of metabolites and DNA which
would allow for more accurate and reproducible results in the area
of gut microbiome investigation.20 There
are few studies available which investigate the different collection
and storage methods and their impact on metabolite and bacteria levels.

Gratton et al. demonstrated that storing a fecal sample over time
at different temperatures before processing for analysis has a large
impact on the metabolic profiles of human feces. An increase in branched-chain
amino acids (BCAAs) and aromatic amino acids was reported after a
fecal sample underwent a freeze–thaw cycle before extracting
fecal water.21 This information has supported
a previous paper by Saric et al. which has also demonstrated an increase
in BCAAs after freeze–thaw cycles of the fecal sample prior
to fecal water extraction.22 Furthermore,
a number of studies have illustrated the effects of different sample-processing
procedures on the metabolite levels. An overview of the impact of
steps such as homogenization, filtration, centrifugation, and solvent
extraction has been previously presented.23−25

The impact
of storage conditions on bacterial community levels
has been examined. Roesch et al. demonstrated a 10% change in bacterial
community levels in a fecal sample when stored at −80 °C
at different time points post receiving the sample.26 However, other studies have reported no significant difference
in results because of differing storage conditions on bacterial community
levels in fecal samples, and27,28 others have recommended
a collection protocol to minimize the impact.29 With respect to the fecal metabolome, there is no such consensus,
and further studies are warranted.

In summary, analyzing the
gut microbiome has become an integral
part of many human studies, and assessment of the fecal water metabolome
can yield valuable information. However, more work is needed to examine
the impact of storage and processing procedures on the metabolite
levels in fecal water. The objective of this study was to examine
the impact of different storage conditions prior to metabolite extraction
on the fecal water metabolome. The work highlights the need for standardized
procedures.

Results
A total of nine healthy participants were included
in this study
including four males and five females. Two of the individuals supplied
samples on two separate occasions resulting in a total of 11 sample
sets. The mean age was 34 years and participants had a mean body mass
index (BMI) of 24.1 ± 2.78 kg/m2. A summary of the
baseline characteristics of the participants is presented in Table 1.

Examination of the principal
component analysis (PCA) revealed
that the interindividual variation was the dominant source of variation
on the dataset. The samples of the individuals were grouped together
in the PCA scores plot (Figure 1A). To explore the impact of storage, we employed a row-wise
centering of the data and this resulted in separation of the samples
according to the storage type (Figure 1 B).

Figure 1 PCA score plots of samples (A) colored by individual sample
sets
(top left) and the different sample procedures (top right) used in
the study. Average of each individual sample set (B) was performed,
plotted (bottom left), and subtracted to each sample (bottom right).
Individual sample sets were labeled with numbers (1–11), samples
sets 8 and 9 are from the same individual, and samples sets 10 and
11 are from the same individual.

To examine the impact of the storage further, a univariate
analysis
approach was employed. A total of 14 compounds from the fecal water
analysis were significantly different across the three storage conditions.
Significant metabolites from repeated measures ANOVA corrected by
the false discovery rate (FDR) are presented in Table 2. Interestingly, the metabolites were predominantly
increased following freezing at −80 °C prior to preparation
of fecal water (Figure 2). The sample stored on ice for 24 h had the highest fidelity to
the freshly prepared samples. Closer examination of the significantly
different metabolites revealed that the BCAAs, aromatic amino acids,
Krebs cycle intermediates, and monosaccharides were found at higher
levels in fecal water prepared from frozen samples. However, the short
chain fatty acid (SCFA), butyrate, was lower in fecal water from frozen/defrosted,
and on ice samples. Figure 3 shows the typical spectra of fecal water analyzed from fresh,
frozen, and on ice samples.

Discussion
The
present findings point to differences in levels of several
metabolites following different sample storage conditions prior to
metabolite extraction. Overall, BCAAs and derivatives, aromatic amino
acids, SCFAs, Krebs cycle intermediates, and monosaccharides were
sensitive to the storage procedure. Our study highlights the urgent
need to standardize processing parameters for the preparation of fecal
water in order to obtain meaningful data.

This current lack
of standardization is aggravated by the fact
that fecal analysis entails a higher sensitivity to differences in
study design than most other biofluid analyses.25 Previous work has demonstrated that insufficient sample
collection can introduce bias because of the heterogeneity of fecal
samples. Typically, despite fecal samples being highly heterogeneous,
the fecal sampling method is to take a small portion and extract the
metabolites.25 Gratton and colleagues observed
that fecal water extracted from 15 g of feces contained different
concentrations of certain amino acids and carboxylic acids compared
with fecal water extracted from a lower amount of 350 mg of fecal
samples.21 Furthermore, proper sample storage
is essential to avoid additional bias post sampling. Both microbial
and enzymatic activities affect the fecal metabolome. Hence, both
storage temperature of the fecal samples and time before preparation
of fecal water can have an impact on the metabolome and on the microbial
composition.21,30 Based on the findings of the
present study, sample storage prior to the extraction of the metabolites
is critical for the final levels of fecal metabolites. With the exception
of butyrate, in which the highest levels were found in fresh fecal
samples, metabolite levels increased in samples prepared from frozen
fecal matter.

Similar results were observed in studies by Gratton
et al. and
Saric et al.21,22 In these previous studies, the
relative concentrations of BCAAs and aromatic amino acids were elevated
in the fecal samples following a freezing cycle.21,22 In our study, the BCAAs and aromatic amino acids phenylalanine and
tyrosine were increased in samples prepared from frozen fecal matter.
The impact of freezing was not limited to BCAAs and aromatic amino
acids, and indeed significant changes were observed for other metabolites
such as fumarate, isobutyrate, nicotinate, and aspartate. Butyrate
levels were decreased in samples prepared from fecal samples kept
on ice and frozen samples. However, there is no simple interpretation
for the unique decrease of this SCFA. The same pattern consisting
of an increase of BCAAs and a decrease of SCFAs was observed in lyophilized
feces compared with wet feces.22 In this
study, the authors suggested that the decreased relative concentrations
of SCFAs after the lyophilization process were connected to the instability
and variability of these compounds over time.22 This would support the decrease observed in the present study.

Our findings support the call for care in interpretation of metabolites
following freeze–thaw cycles of faeces and support the concept
that these alterations are not because of improved recovery of fecal
metabolites.25 Previous work suggested
that these alterations in the fecal metabolome may be related to the
lysis of cells causing the release of microbial intracellular contents.21,25 When a fecal sample is frozen, ice crystals form within the cells
and these crystals damage the cell walls. Once the sample is thawed,
the damaged cell walls allow the release of intracellular contents.31,32 This hypothesis is supported by the fact that several metabolites
such as glutamate, BCAAs, Krebs cycle intermediates, and glucose increased
only following freezing of the fecal sample. Taken together, it is
evident that the procedure used for sample preparation can have an
impact on the metabolic profile and care is needed when interpreting
results from the fecal water metabolome. Interestingly, our results
highlight that avoidance of freezing fecal samples by storage on ice
for 24 h increased the fidelity to the freshly processed samples.
For many large studies, preparation of fecal water from fresh samples
will not be possible, and our results support the potential of storage
on ice for 24 h until extraction of fecal water is possible.

The present study has a number of strengths and limitations worth
mentioning. The same fecal sample was used for each of the three storage
conditions allowing us to disentangle the effects from the larger
interindividual variation. Furthermore, the study design enabled comparison
to a fresh sample processed immediately following collection. A limitation
of the current study is the small sample size; however, it is worth
noting that the sample size is larger than previous work in the area.21

Conclusions
Analysis of the fecal
water metabolome has the potential to enhance
our understanding of the importance of the gut microbiome in a number
of health and disease conditions.33,34 However, the
lack of standardization in the processing of fecal samples may lead
to misinterpretation of the data. The present findings support the
need for a standardized and robust sample preparation for fecal water.
Importantly, freezing of solid fecal matter prior to fecal water extraction
should be avoided.

Materials and Methods
Participants and Sample
Collection
Nine participants
donated a total of eleven fecal samples. Participants were healthy
males or females aged between 18 and 60 years of age with a BMI range
of >18.5 and <29 kg/m2. Exclusion criteria included
smokers, anyone taking medication or nutritional supplements, pregnant
or lactating, or diagnosed with a medical disease. The study was approved
by the Human Research Ethics Committee at University College Dublin
(LS_16_91_Gibbons_Brennan) and written informed consent was obtained
from each participant prior to participation in the study.

Each
participant received a sample collection pack consisting of a plastic
container, two zip-lock freezer bags, gloves, and two blue plastic
bags. Subjects were asked to save the full bowel movement, record
the time when the sample was produced, not contaminate the sample
with urine or toilet paper, and store the sample in a cool environment
prior to attending the visit center. Participants were asked to collect
the sample on the day of the study visit to ensure that it was as
fresh as possible. The samples were immediately placed on ice using
different conditions as described below.

Sample Processing
Each sample was weighed for total
weight before being processed. Subsamples from each fecal sample were
taken. From these subsamples, the following three conditions were
examined. The first sample was processed immediately to obtain a fresh
fecal water sample. The second sample was kept for 24 h on ice, and
the third sample was placed in the −80 °C freezer for
24 h. The following day, the frozen sample was thawed and the fecal
water extraction was performed.

Each subsample was processed
in the same way to obtain a fecal water sample regardless of storage
conditions. In short, 5 g of the sample was weighed into a 50 mL conical
tube and 2× w/v of sterile phosphate-buffered saline was added.
The sample was homogenized manually using a tissue grinder and centrifuged
at 2654×g for 1 h at 4 °C. Following this,
the samples were aliquoted and centrifuged a further two times at
16 000×g for 30 min at 4 °C before
filtering (a 0.7 μm pore Minisart Filter followed by a 0.2 μm
pore Whatmann filter) and freezing at −80 °C until NMR
analysis.

NMR Spectroscopy
To prepare the samples for NMR spectroscopy,
60 μL of D2O and 10 μL of sodium trimethylsilyl
propionate-[2,2,3,3-2H4] (TSP) (0.05 g/mL) were added
to 540 μL of fecal water. NMR spectra were acquired on a 600
MHz Varian NMR spectrometer by using a CPMG pulse sequence at 25 °C.
Spectra were acquired with 16 384 data points and 128 scans.
Water suppression was achieved during the relaxation delay of 3 s.
All 1H NMR spectra were referenced to TSP at 0.0 parts
per million (ppm) and processed manually with Chenomx NMR Suite (version
7.5) by using a line broadening of 0.2 Hz, followed by phase correction
and baseline correction. Metabolites were identified by Chenomx NMR
Suite. Spectra were then bucketed in domains of 0.005 ppm excluding
both TSP and water regions. Data were normalized to the sum of the
spectral integral.

Metabolite identification was performed using
Chenomx NMR Suite 8.3 Profiler (Chenomx Inc., Edmonton, Canada). Further
confirmations to the assignment of proton peaks were provided by comparing
the chemical shifts with those available in the Human Metabolome Database
(http://www.hmdb.ca).

Statistical
Analyses
The dataset containing 1780 variables was log transformed
prior
statistical analysis. PCA on samples was carried out on all samples
to obtain an overview of the data. Because we analyzed the same sample
per individual using different storage conditions, the interindividual
variability may obscure the actual issue of interest in a multivariate
approach.35 Therefore, for visualization
purposes, the standardized projection of the individual effects was
used by a row-wise mean centering36 of
samples, subtracting the within-subject variation for each individual.37 Then, a new “multilevel” PCA score
plot was performed exhibiting the variation because of the sample
class.36 To assess differences between
the three conditions of sample storage, repeated measures ANOVA followed
by Bonferroni post hoc comparisons were carried out on the dataset.
Benjamini–Hochberg FDR was used to correct analysis for multiple
comparisons.38 Statistical significance
was considered at a P-value of <0.05. All statistical
analyses were performed in the open source statistical programming
environment R v3.3.1.
