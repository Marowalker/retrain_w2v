A coatable polyvinylbutyral
(PVB)–polyaniline (PANI) nanocomposite
was designed for high microwave absorption efficiency. The maximum
absorption efficiency 88.2 dB GHz/mm was obtained for the PANI nanofiber-loaded
PVB (PVBPN) nanocomposite with a large bandwidth, whereas a pristine
PANI-containing composite shows 53.5 dB GHz/mm in the frequency range
8.2–18 GHz. The presence of nanoslit pores in PVBPN also helps
to achieve a large bandwidth and hence high microwave absorption efficiency.
Standard electromagnetic simulation also shows that power absorbed
by the PVBPN nanocomposite is high and its ultrathin coating over
the dielectric substrate (epoxy) is promising for broadband tuneable
reflection loss.

Introduction
Recent interest is
on lightweight broadband ultrathin microwave
absorbing materials.1−4 The lightweight and broadband microwave absorption property of a
single layer material is understood from the microwave absorption
efficiency.5−8 Nonmetallic/composite materials are well known for microwave absorption
along with metamaterials.1,2,4,9,10 Lightweight,
ultrathin coatable polymer nanocomposites for microwave absorption
especially in high frequency (8.2–18 GHz) have attracted interest
recently to protect from electromagnetic (EM) threats such as EM interference
(EMI).11−13 Furthermore, there are many advantages of using polymer
nanocomposites for microwave absorption such as corrosion protective,
large area fabrication, inexpensive, and so forth.14 The conventional ferrite-based absorbers such as nickel,
cobalt, nickel–zinc, cobalt–zinc ferrites were designed
based on the impedance matching and suggesting that the magnetic dielectric
core–shell structure is promising.15−21 The EM absorbers such as reduced graphene oxide–ferrite and
carbon nanotubes–ferrites were also designed in a similar manner.22−26 Recently, morphology tuning of dielectrics for broad-band microwave
absorption has been proposed.27,28 The conducting polymers,
especially polyaniline (PANI)-based materials, were also reported
for microwave absorption.29−31 The significant importance received
by PANI for microwave absorption is due to the adjustable conductivity,
permittivity value, molecular weight, and bulk-level easy synthesis.32,33 Further, the morphology of PANI can be easily tuned and easy to
disperse in the polymer matrix. Apart from this, PANI is proposed
for smart coating because of its self-healing properties.34,35

The conductivity of PANI can be easily adjusted depending
on synthesis
conditions.32 Low-temperature (−30
± 2 °C) PANI synthesis results high molecular weight and
is also reported for high conductivity.32 Huang and Kaner report that the bulk amount of PANI nanofiber (PNF)
can be easily synthesized in one-step chemical synthesis at room temperature.36 A PANI-loaded weather resistive polymer such
as polyvinylbutyral (PVB)/polyurethane/epoxy is reported for EMI shielding
application.31,33,37 The key interest on PVB is that it is more attractive for packaging/encapsulation
as well as smart coating especially in organic electronics.38 The objective of the present work is to design
ultrathin polymer nanocomposites (PVB–PANI) based on material
properties for high microwave absorption efficiency.

Design Approach
In general, the microwave absorbing materials are designed for
the metal/perfect electric conductor (PEC) backed condition. The reflection
loss (RL) of a single layer absorber is given by1−5 1  Zin = input impedance
and it can be written as 2  Z0 is
the characteristic
impedance of free space (=377) and d = thickness
of the absorber.

εr and μr are relative permittivity
(εr = ε′ – iε″)
and permeability (μr = μ′ – iμ″),
respectively.

For practical applications, the RL value of −10
dB is the
optimum level (corresponds to 90% absorption), and therefore, microwave
absorption efficiency (RE) of a material
is expressed as5−8 3  where
ΔS = ∫RLdfRL≤−10dB.

The RE value depends on thickness,
bandwidth (RL ≤ −10 dB), and minimum RL value. For better
microwave absorption efficiency, large bandwidth with a minimum RL
value and low thickness is preferred.2 The
literature shows that for large bandwidth and a minimum RL value,
the moderate electrical conductivity of the absorbing layer and uniform
power loss distribution is advantageous. According to the free electron
theory, the electrical conductivity is given by9 σ = πε0fε″.
Further, the permittivity value should not be very high to achieve
high bandwidth. This is because the derivative of Zin with respect to d(∂Zin/∂d) can be expressed
as39 4  

Thus, it also indicates that
for low permittivity, ∂Zin/∂d is high and RL
is sensitive to the thickness.

The one-dimensional dielectric
nanofiller (rod, fiber) is advantageous
for better microwave absorption, as they can form the linkage easily
inside the matrix which leads to the interfacial polarization as well
as effective permittivity along with the dielectric loss. The isotropic
antenna mechanism also plays a key role for rod or fiber nanostructures.28,40 According to that, the dielectric nanorods/nanofibers can act as
a receiver antenna for incident energy and transform it into the small
dissipative current (micro current) through it.28 On the basis of the above mentioned factors, the PVB–PNF
composite was designed and is schematically shown in Figure 1. In our previous work,2 the RL value of the PVB–PANI nanocomposite
(PNF synthesized at 25 °C) was reported for a thick single layer
(≥2 mm).2 However, the microwave
absorption efficiency of the PVB–PANI nanocomposite (PNF synthesized
at ∼0 °C) and its coating on lightweight structural materials
such as epoxy for microwave absorption were not investigated. Present
effort attempts to investigate the PVB–PNF (synthesized at
∼0 °C) coated epoxy composite for microwave absorption.

absorption efficiency and its simple fabrication.

Results and Discussion
The cross-sectional surface morphology
of the as-prepared PPNF
nanocomposite is shown in Figure 2a (low magnification) and Figure 2b (high magnification). It suggests that
PNFs (average diameter ∼50 nm and length ∼1 μm)
form a network in the PVB. However, a few nanoslit pores were also
observed.

Figure 2 Cross-sectional surface morphology of the as-prepared PPNF nanocomposite
film at (a) low magnification and (b) high magnification.

Figure 3a,b respectively
shows the variation of real (ε′) and imaginary part (ε″)
of the permittivity of PPNF and PP composites in the frequency range
8.2–18 GHz. The ε′ corresponds to the storage
ability of electric energy, whilst ε″ correspond to the
dissipation of electric energy. As observed in Figure 3a,b, ε′ value of PPNF nanocomposite
(13.5–12) is higher than the PP composite (8.5–8). Hence,
it indicates the high storage ability of electric field energy by
PPNF. Similarly, the ε″ value of PPNF is also higher
than the PP composite (Figure 3b), indicating higher electric energy dissipation in PPNF
compared to the PP composite. Mechanistically, the obtained high value
of ε′ and ε″ of PPNF as compared to the
PP composite is due to the interfacial polarization, heterogeneity,
as well as morphology. As the surface to volume ratio of PNFs is high,
the presence of it in PVB leads to more heterogeneity as well as effective
permittivity and the interfacial polarization, which can be identified
from the change of the ε″ value, that is, Δε″.42 The Δε″ value of the PPNF
nanocomposite is 1.1, which is much higher than that of the PP composite
(0.6), indicating that interfacial polarization in the PPNF nanocomposite
is more as compared to that in the PP composite in the 8.2–18
GHz range.42,43 It is believed due to the much
heterogeneous interfaces in the PPNF nanocomposite (as the PANI nanofiber
creates more linkage inside the PVB) as compared to the PP composite.

permittivity (ε″) values of (a) PPNF and (b) PP composite

The thickness-dependent RL (dB) values of PPNF and PP composites
are shown in Figure 4a,b, respectively. As shown in Figure 4a, the minimum RL value −14.7 dB was obtained
for the PPNF nanocomposite (1 mm), while the minimum RL value of the
PP composite was obtained as −5 dB for the same thickness.
On increasing the thickness by 0.1 mm, the RL value of the PPNF nanocomposite
was decreased with a wide bandwidth and owing to one-fourth wavelength
equation, that is17,19,21 5  Here, dm and fm are the matching thickness and
the matching
frequency, respectively, with respect to the RL peak. From eq 5, it is clear that the
shift of the RL peak to the lower frequency region occurs by increasing
the absorber thickness. The minimum RL values of the PPNF nanocomposite
were −46.5, −55.5, −57.4, and −55.7 dB
for the thicknesses 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5 mm, respectively. On the
other hand, the minimum RL value was obtained as −43 dB for
the PP composite (1.5 mm). To determine the RE value, bandwidth (fE) and corresponding
area were calculated for the PPNF nanocomposite. As shown in Figure 5a–d, the obtained fE values of PPNF nanocomposites were found to
be 4.2, 5.7, 6.1, and 7.3 GHz, respectively. The RE values of the PPNF nanocomposite were found to be 18.3,
50.4, 81.1, 88.2, and 86 dB GHz/mm for the thickness 1.1, 1.2, 1.3,
1.4, and 1.5 mm respectively. On the other hand, the maximum RE value was found to be 52.3 dB GHz/mm for the
PP composite for the thickness 1.5 mm. The comparison of the RE value with thickness for the PPNF nanocomposite
and the PP composite is shown in Figure 6, and it indicates the excellent microwave
absorption efficiency of the PPNF nanocomposite as compared to the
PP composite. A comparison of the maximum RE value of recently engineered composite materials, based on the structure–property
relationship, with present composite, is shown in Figure 7. Relatively, PPNF has high
a RE value as compared to the other reported
composites. However, the minimum RL value of PPNF can be tuned with
thickness, and the minimum RL value can be reached (−79 dB
for the thickness 2.5 mm for narrow bandwidth), which decreases the
microwave absorption efficiency. In the case of PPNF, the optimal
microwave absorption efficiency was achieved for 1.4 mm (Figure 6). Thus, it indicates
that thin single layer PPNF coating over dielectrics could be promising
to achieve high microwave absorption efficiency, large bandwidth as
well as minimum RL.

PPNF nanocomposite (this work).

For a better understanding of outstanding microwave absorption
efficiency of the PPNF nanocomposite, a standard EM simulation was
carried out using CST Microwave Studio. On the basis of the experimental
setup, present composite materials were assigned as shown in Figure 8, and 0.5 W was taken
as a default stimulated power on the source port. The obtained absorbed
power, reflected power, and loss in metals (PEC) was simulated. The
simulated result of the PPNF nanocomposite for different thicknesses
is shown in the Figure S1 (Supporting Information). The simulation result indicates that power absorbed by PPNF is
predominant in high frequency, and a similar trend is observed in
RL. The simulation results of absorbed power and reflected power by
the PP composite are shown in Figure S2 (Supporting Information). It shows that power absorbed by the PP composite
is much less than the PPNF nanocomposite. The variation of absorbed
power (%) by the PP composite and the PPNF nanocomposite in different
thicknesses is shown in Figure 9a,b, respectively. As shown in Figure 9a,b, unlike the PPNF nanocomposite, the PP
composite cannot absorb all the stimulating power in any frequency
for the thickness range 1–1.5 mm. The comparison of absorbed
power (%) of the PP composite and the PPNF nanocomposite (thickness
1.4 mm) is shown in Figure 9c, and it clearly indicates the better microwave absorption
property of the PPNF nanocomposite as compared to the PP composite.

and (b) PPNF nanocomposite. (c) Comparison of absorbed power (%) of
PPNF and PP composites (thickness 1.4 mm).

In the case of the PPNF nanocomposite surface, high power
loss
takes place. It is because of the presence of PNFs, which act as a
receiver antenna for incident microwave and transmit into micro current,
and hence, incident power is distributed uniformly inside the PPNF
nanocomposite. The effective medium consists of dielectrics and inhomogeneous
a few nanoslit pores (the spacing between the two nanofibers). The
nanoslit pores act as a tiny transparent plane for incident wave,44 and therefore, the intrinsically predominant
energy loss takes place through the PNFs as nanofibers are well connected
in the matrix. Therefore, high power loss distribution can be expected
for the PPNF nanocomposite. In other words, the presence of a few
nanoslit pores effectively interrupted the spreading of incident microwaves,
and hence, dissipation of EM energy takes place owing to the impedance
difference, resulting in further enhancement of storage energy and
absorption, which also favors achievement of large bandwidth. That
is why high microwave absorption efficiency for the PPNF nanocomposite
was obtained.

Mechanistically ultrathin coating of PPNF is advantageous
for broad
band microwave absorption. The industrial standard polymer which is
used most commonly in various applications including aircraft is epoxy.
As for most of the applications, 2–3 mm thicker large laminates
were preferred; therefore, a simulation of ultrathin PPNF-coated (0.1–0.5
mm) epoxy (2 mm) was carried out in this study. For comparison, the
PP composite was also taken. The schematic of the unit cell structure
and the artificial periodic array is shown in Figure 10a. In the designed structure, the unit cell
with the PEC substrate was constructed with the same area (10 mm ×
10 mm) in the periodic array. The boundary conditions, viz., electric
and magnetic were applied at the X- and Y-directions, respectively, so that microwave propagates along the Z-axis.

coatings of PP-coated epoxy, and (d) PPNF-coated epoxy. (e) Simulated
and experimental RL (dB) of 0.5 mm PPNF nanocomposite-coated epoxy.

The simulated RL (dB) of PPNF-coated
epoxy periodic array is shown
in Figure 10a. The
RL value was obtained as −25 dB for the PPNF coating 0.4 mm,
whereas for 0.2 and 0.3 mm coating, the minimum RL values were obtained
as −23, −20, and −10 dB (Figure 10b,d). The minimum RL value was decreased
to −29 dB with a large bandwidth for the PPNF coating thickness
of 0.5 mm. On the other hand, the minimum RL value was found to be
−17.5 dB for PP coating (0.5 mm) over epoxy (Figure 10c). Further, in the case of
PP coating, the bandwidth was found to be small, and the standard
RL value (−10 dB) was not obtained for the coating thickness
up to 0.3 mm. From the simulated RL, it was observed that PPNF ultrathin
coating is more advantageous to achieve minimum RL and  large bandwidth.

In order to validate the proposed PPNF nanocomposite coating, the
epoxy composite was fabricated. Initially, the epoxy laminate (2 mm)
was prepared by using commercial epoxy resin (Atul Pvt. Ltd., India),
and the PPNF nanocomposite was coated (0.5 mm) on epoxy laminate by
solution casting followed by open air drying (24 h) and emery paper
polishing. Coating thickness can be controlled through the locally
prepared Teflon mould, followed by polishing. The conducting aluminium
tape (PEC) was pasted on the back side of the PPNF-coated epoxy, and
RL was recorded for 8.2–18 GHz. The experimental and simulated
RL of 0.5 mm PPNF-coated epoxy (aluminium backed) is shown in Figure 10e. The tendency
of both experimental and simulated RL matches well. In fact, experimental
RL covers better bandwidth with the minimum RL value of −32
dB (11 GHz). Thus, it indicates that the PPNF nanocomposite can be
considered as one of the potential coating material for tuning the
microwave absorption.

Conclusions
The coatable polymer
nanocomposite was designed and demonstrated
for high microwave absorption efficiency. The maximum absorption efficiency
of 88.2 dB GHz/mm was obtained for the chemically synthesized PNF-loaded
PVB composite with a large bandwidth in the frequency range 8.2–18
GHz. The EM simulation also shows that PNF-loaded PVB has better microwave
absorption power as compared to the bulk PANI. Further, the simulation
result indicates that an ultrathin coating of the PVB–PANI
nanocomposite over the epoxy substrate (2 mm) is promising for tuneable
broad band microwave absorption.

Experimental Section
The PNFs were synthesized at 0 ± 1 °C, according to the
standard procedure described in the literature (for organic phase
chloroform was used and HCl was added in the aqueous phase).36 For comparison, bulk PANI was also synthesized
at same conditions according to the procedure described in the literature.32 In both the cases, double distilled aniline
was used.

The PVB–PANI nanocomposite was prepared by
solution processing.
At room temperature, PVB was dissolved slowly in ethanol and PNF was
added very slowly to this solution under stirring (5 wt %). After
that, it was further stirred for another 3 h. Finally, it was poured
to the X-band and Ku-band standard sample holders and kept in open
air for drying (24 h). The PVB–PNF and PVB–PANI composites
were named as PPNF and PP composites, respectively.

The surface
morphology of the as-prepared PPNF nanocomposite was
studied using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (Carl
Zeiss). The relative permittivity (εr) of the prepared
composites was recorded in the X-band and Ku-band using a vector network
analyzer by the standard Nicholson–Ross–Weir method.41
