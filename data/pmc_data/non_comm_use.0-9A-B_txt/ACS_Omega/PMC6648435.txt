Understanding the details of thermal
transport in graphdiyne and
its nanostructures would help to broaden their applications. On the
basis of the molecular dynamics simulations and spectrally decomposed
heat current analysis, we show that the high-frequency phonons in
graphdiyne can be strongly hindered in nanoribbons because of the
boundary scattering. The isotropic transport in graphdiyne can be
switched to anisotropic along the armchair and zigzag directions.
Adding side chains onto the nanoribbon edges further reduces the thermal
conductivity (TC) along both armchair and zigzag directions thanks
to the reduction of heat current carried by low-frequency modes, a
mechanism that arises from the phonon resonances. The uniaxial tensile
strain plays a different role in the TC of graphdiyne, armchair nanoribbons,
and zigzag nanoribbons. Tensile strain causes the thermal conductivities
of graphdiyne, and armchair nanoribbons increase first and then get
reduced, whereas for zigzag nanoribbons, the TC decreases with strain
first and reaches to a plateau. The different low-frequency phonon
response on strain is the main reason for the different TC behavior.
For graphdiyne and armchair nanoribbons, the low-frequency heat current
is enhanced gradually first and then get reduced with the increase
of strain, while that of zigzag nanoribbons decreases with strain
and then increases slightly. The current studies could help us understand
the phonon transport in graphdiyne and its nanoribbons, which is useful
for their TC engineering.

1 Introduction
Graphynes (GYs), which
are two-dimensional (2D) structures assembled
by sp- and sp2-hybridized carbon atoms, have attracted
great attention because of their distinguished mechanical, optical,
thermal, and electronic properties.1 GYs
have been applied in many fields such as rechargeable batteries,2,3 solar cells,4 thermoelectric materials,5−7 and so forth. In these applications, the thermal transport property
of GYs is an important factor for the stability and/or performance
of the corresponding devices. For example, overheating is a common
phenomenon in rechargeable batteries and it can affect the battery
stability or even lead to explosions during the service. As a result,
GYs should have high thermal conductivity (TC) to avoid thermal accumulation
for battery application. On the other hand, GYs should behave as “phonon
glass” to maximize the performance in thermoelectric applications.
The study of thermal transport property of GYs has been performed
by several researchers. Using the Green’s function calculations,
Ouyang et al. have demonstrated that the thermal conductance of armchair
β-GY nanoribbons presents abnormal stepwise width dependence.5 On the basis of first-principles calculations
and molecular dynamics simulations, Shi et al.6,7 have
investigated the thermal transport of γ-GY and graphdiyne (GDY)
at room temperature. They have found that the TC of γ-GY and
GDY is much different, demonstrating the tunability of TC by the number
of ethynyl units. The effect of acetylenic linkages on the TC of GYs
has also been confirmed by Zhang et al.8 They have found that the presence of acetylenic linkages in GYs
leads to a significant reduction of TC as a result of the associated
low atom density in the structures and weak single bonds in the acetylenic
linkages. Although the overall TC of different GY structures has been
reported, the detailed information on thermal transport, especially
the heat carried by the modes of different frequencies, is yet to
be investigated. Such information is quite necessary for better understanding
and engineering the thermal transport of GYs. Besides, strain is inevitable
in devices because of its atomic thin nature. Actually, strain engineering
has become a useful and important strategy to improve the materials
performance.9−15 As a result, it is also important to study the effect of strain
on the thermal transport of GYs and related structures. Moreover,
our previous work shows that by forming side branches on nanostructures,
it is possible to design resonant modes which can hinder the propagation
of low-frequency phonons.16,17 Actually, side branches
in 2D materials have been shown to be robust in thermal transport
engineering.18−20 Differing from the branches added to the main structure
in previous studies, GYs possess single-atom branches composed of
single and triple bonds when downsizing it to nanoribbons in a proper
way. Because those side branches are in atomic size, which is much
thinner than the traditionally considered resonant structures, their
ability on producing the resonant modes is yet to be clarified.

In this work, taking GDY as an example, we perform a comprehensive
study on the thermal transport of GDY and GDY nanoribbons using nonequilibrium
molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations. The spectrally decomposed heat
current (SDHC) is analyzed for the cases with and without lattice
strain. We show that although the TC of GDY is isotropic, the TCs
of its nanoribbons along the armchair and zigzag directions are much
different. The SDHC demonstrates that the difference arises from the
phonons at low frequencies, indicating that a different strategy should
be used for TC engineering along the two directions.

2 Results and Discussion
To calculate the TC with NEMD, different
sample lengths along zigzag
and armchair directions are constructed. Figure 1a,c is the schematic of the constructed nanoribbons
along the armchair and zigzag directions. The widths of the nanoribbons
along the armchair and zigzag directions are chosen as 8.9 and 9.8
nm, respectively. To study the edge effect on thermal transport, we
add side chains that involve a single and triple bond on the edges
of armchair and zigzag nanoribbons, which correspond to Figure 1b,d, respectively. It is worth
to note that we did not passivate the dangling bonds on the nanoribbon
edges with hydrogen atoms. The passivation of H atoms will reduce
the TC of all structures; however, it will not affect the trends of
our results. Moreover, H atoms are much lighter than carbon atoms;
thus, a much smaller time step is required if H atoms are included,
leading to a much heavier simulation. As a result, we do not consider
the passivation of nanoribbon edges. All simulations are conducted
with the LAMMPS code.21 The adaptive intermolecular
reactive empirical bond order (Airebo) potential22 is adopted to describe the interatomic interactions and
a time step of 0.5 fs is adopted. The atoms at the two ends of the
samples are fixed to eliminate the drift of systems. Next to the fixed
layers, the atoms within the length Lbath in the left side and right side are, respectively, coupled to hot
and cold Langevin heat baths. The coupling constant is set to τbath = 1 ps and the minimum bath length Lbath is 32 nm. All TCs are calculated at the mean temperature T = 300 K. The simulation time for the systems to reach
to the nonequilibrium steady state ranges from 10 to 50 ns, depending
on the length of the systems. The energy E injected
into the hot bath and subtracted from the cold bath is recorded for
10 ns of simulations after the system reached steady state, the heat
flux J is extracted as J =
dE/dt/S, where S is the cross section of the samples, and a thickness of
3.5 Å is used for all cases. With the heat flux and temperature
gradient, the TC can be evaluated based on Fourier’s law 1

nanoribbon structures.
Structures (a,c) are nanoribbons along the armchair and zigzag directions,
respectively. Structures (b,d) are constructed based on structures
(a,c), respectively, by adding side chains onto the edges.

Because of the ballistic transport feature of the
phonons with
a mean-free path larger than the system length, the TC obtained from
NEMD simulations is size-dependent. To obtain the intrinsic TC corresponding
to the situation of infinite long samples, one needs to extrapolate
the TCs of the samples with finite sizes to infinite length. On the
basis of Matthiessen’s rule, Sellan et al.23 have derived an extrapolation strategy 2  where κ(L) and κ(∞)
correspond to the TCs of the samples with length L and infinite, respectively. α and β are the fitting
parameters. Usually, only the first two parts are kept in eq 2; thus, a linear relationship
between 1/κ(L) and 1/L is
obtained, which works very well in most cases. However, when the mean-free
path of phonons distributes in a broad range and the simulated lengths
are much shorter than the long mean-free path, the linear relation
cannot fit the length-dependent TC with high accuracy. In our simulations,
we obtained the TCs for samples with lengths ranging from 22 to 400
nm (the results for 22 nm are not shown in Figure 2a). Indeed, we found that in this length
range, the dependence of 1/κ(L) on 1/L cannot be well described by the linear relationships.
The R2 factor, which describes the goodness
of fitting, is smaller than 0.94 (R2 approaches
to 1 for a good fitting). Instead, a quadratic fitting described by eq 2 (with higher orders of
1/L neglected) could fit our length-dependent TC
much better as shown in Figure 2a. For all quadratic fittings, the R2 is larger than 0.998, indicating a very accurate fitting.

Figure 2 (a) Extrapolation
of 1/κ vs 1/L with eq 2 for GDY and GDY nanoribbons;
(b) Extrapolated TCs of GDY along armchair and zigzag directions as
well as the nanoribbons illustrated in Figure 1.

The nonlinear behavior of 1/κ versus 1/L is more pronounced for short sample lengths. As a result, using
the linear extrapolation strategy for short samples usually will underestimate
the TC.24 For long samples, the deviation
from the linear relationship of 1/κ from 1/L is small. Actually, Dong et al.24 demonstrated
that if the sample length is larger than the phonon mean-free path,
one can get an accurate extrapolation with the linear fitting strategy.
However, one needs to simulate the TC for several long samples, which
is computationally expensive, especially for high TC materials. Alternatively,
we suggest to use the quadratic extrapolation strategy based on the
TCs of samples with lengths around the phonon mean-free path, which
might be useful to compromise between the problems of heavy simulations
and the accuracy when a nonlinear behavior is found.

Figure 2b demonstrates
the extrapolated TCs for each case. For 2D GDY, the thermal transport
is isotropic along the armchair and zigzag directions with the value
of 50 W/m K. However, when downsizing into nanoribbons, the TC becomes
anisotropic and is greatly reduced because of the strong phonon boundary
scattering. For nanoribbons along the armchair (Figure 1a) and zigzag (Figure 1c) directions, the TCs are only 28.0 and
18.2 W/m K, respectively. The large anisotropic transport arises from
the different boundary environment, that is, the nanoribbons along
the armchair direction possess much flat edges compared to those along
the zigzag direction; thus, the scattering of phonons by the armchair
edges weakens. In our previous work, we found that the surface structures
of nanowires16 and thin films17 could affect the thermal transport noticeably
because of the resonant hybridization effect. To study the effect
of edge structures on the thermal transport of the GDY nanoribbons,
we added side chains composed of a single and triple bond on the edges
of nanoribbons (a,c). The resulting structures are illustrated by Figure 1b,d, and the corresponding
TCs are demonstrated in Figure 2b. With the additional chains, the TCs of GDY nanoribbons
along both armchair and zigzag directions are reduced, revealing that
adding materials properly could hinder the thermal transport of GDY
nanoribbons. The observed phenomenon offers a further possibility
for the engineering of nanoribbon TC.

To understand how the
edges affect the phonon transport at different
frequencies, we calculated the frequency-resolved heat current of
GDY along the armchair direction and GDY nanoribbons based on the
NEMD simulations. The heat flux qL→R(ω) across the interface of two adjacent blocks L and R at
frequency ω can be casted as25 3  where tsimu and S are the simulation time and cross section
of samples. VL(ω) and VR(ω) denote the Fourier transformed velocity vectors
at ω
for the blocks L and R, respectively. KLR represents the force constant matrix connecting the blocks L and
R. More details about this technique can be found from refs.16,25,26 In our
simulations, the heat current is averaged over 10 simulations and
smoothened by a Gaussian function with a window of 0.6 THz.

The calculated SDHC for GDY and nanoribbons with a fixed length
of 52 nm is illustrated in Figure 3. Note that the cutoff frequency of these systems is
∼60 THz; to facilitate the comparisons, we only show the heat
current below 30 THz as the heat current at high frequencies is small.
For GDY, the SDHC is relatively large below 12 THz, indicating that
the main heat carriers possess frequency below 12 THz. When downsizing
into nanoribbons, the SDHC is greatly reduced in almost the entire
frequency range, especially between 3 and 12 THz. That means, the
main heat carriers in GDY is scattered by the nanoribbon boundaries.
Interestingly, almost all the heat current peaks in nanoribbons shift
to lower frequencies compared to those of GDY, which reveals the phenomenon
of phonon softening in nanoribbons. From the SDHC, the heat current
of nanoribbons along the armchair direction (a,b) is larger than that
along the zigzag direction beyond 1.5 THz, indicating a stronger phonon
scattering by zigzag edges at those frequencies. However, the phonon
scattering mechanism is hardly to hinder the transport of long wavelength
phonons, that is, typically the low-frequency modes. Actually, the
SDHC of all nanoribbons is larger than that of GDY below 1.5 THz,
which is due to the band folding effect and increased acoustic vibrational
freedoms in nanoribbons: similar to nanowires, there are four acoustic
branches in nanoribbons, one branch more than in GDY. Besides, the
period length along the transport direction is larger than that of
GDY, which means the band will be folded and flattened. Because of
the two reasons, the phonon density of states of nanoribbons at low
frequencies will be increased. For the nanoribbons along the zigzag
direction, the band folding effect is more pronounced because of a
larger period length (17.32 Å) compared to the one along the
armchair direction (10 Å), which might be the reason why zigzag
nanoribbons possess a larger SDHC than armchair nanoribbons below
1.5 THz. For nanoribbons along both armchair and zigzag directions,
the additional chains attached to edges only affect the SDHC below
2 THz, beyond which the heat current is almost unchanged. This phenomenon
is consistent with the phonon resonant effect, which can hinder the
low-frequency phonon transport while not effective for high-frequency
modes16,17 when compared to the scattering mechanism.
Consequently, our edge engineering by adding side chains complements
the original edge scattering, which is the reason why edge engineering
can further reduce the TCs of nanoribbons. It is worth noting that
although the samples with a specific length of 52 nm are used for
the SDHC analysis, other lengths give similar trends.

Figure 3 Frequency-resolved heat
current of GDY and GDY nanoribbons with
52 nm in length. The spectral for GDY is along the armchair direction.

Recently, strain engineering has
become an important strategy to
tune the properties of materials, such as electronic and mechanical
properties.9−11 It has been found that lattice strain can be used
to both enhance27−29 and hinder30−34 the thermal transport in low-dimensional materials. To uncover how
tensile strain affects the TC of GDY and its nanoribbons, we applied
2, 5, 8, and 12% of tensile strains on GDY along the armchair direction
and on nanoribbons (a,c). The TC in each case is calculated and demonstrated
in Figure 4. Note that
when the strain is larger than 5%, the time step of simulations needs
to be reduced to make sure the conservation of energy. Here, we adopted
0.2 and 0.1 fs for the strain of 8 and 12%, respectively. It is worth
to note that the structures under all strains studied are stable.
After more than 10 ns of simulations, all structures preserve the
initial conformation with all atoms slightly deviate from their equilibrium
positions. From Figure 4, it is interesting to find that the TC of zigzag nanoribbons possesses
a different strain-dependent behavior compared to that of GDY and
armchair nanoribbons. For GDY and armchair nanoribbons, the TC shows
nonmonotonic behavior and both of them increases with the applied
strain first and then decreases, resulting in a maximum TC of 64.5
and 36.1 W/m K, respectively. However, the critical strain of GDY
for TC reduction is larger than that of armchair nanoribbon, whereas
for the zigzag nanoribbon, the TC decreases with the applied tensile
strain and reaches to a plateau after 5%. The strain-induced TC plateau
has also been found in silicene.35 Tensile
strain generally has two effects on thermal transport. The first one
is to increase the phonon group velocity due to the enhancement of
bond stiffness.36 For example, it has been
found that the flexural mode in graphene can be linearized under tensile
strain. On the other hand, strain can distort the original lattice,
thus breaking the symmetry of the structure. As a result, the anharmonicity
of the material will be enhanced. The enhanced phonon group velocity
and anharmonicity under tensile strain, respectively, have positive
and negative effects on thermal transport. In our case, with the increase
of tensile strain in GDY and armchair nanoribbons, the group velocity
enhancement is dominated at first and then the increased anharmonicity
becomes more important, which results in a maximum TC in those structures.
However, for the zigzag nanoribbon, the anharmonicity is predominated
below 5%, after which with the group velocity effect on TC is comparable
to that of the anharmonic effect, which might be the reason why the
TC decreases monotonically first and reaches to a plateau under tensile
strain.

Figure 4 Strain effect on the TC of GDY and nanoribbons (a,c) shown in Figure 1.

To understand the different TC behaviors on strain
for the three
structures, we also calculated the frequency-resolved heat current
under different strains. The results for the systems with the length
of 52 nm are presented in Figure 5. In general, the SDHC is right-shifted under the stretch
for all structures, which indicates that the atomic bonds become stiffer
under stretch. Actually, it has been found in graphene that the flexural
acoustic mode will be stiffened and linearlized under strain.37 The SDHC shift is more obvious in GDY compared
to that in nanoribbons (both armchair and zigzag). For GDY, under
small strains, the variation of SDHC beyond 4 THz is small. However,
the SDHC is greatly enhanced for the first two peaks (below 4 THz)
until 8% of strain, after which it get reduced noticeably. A similar
behavior appears in the strained armchair nanoribbons, except that
the critical strain for SDHC below 4 THz changes its trend and is
reduced from 8 to 5%, which is in accordance with the critical strain
of TC curves. For zigzag nanoribbons, the SDHC beyond 3 THz is almost
unchanged because of the strong scattering of phonons by edges; thus,
the main effect of strain on zigzag nanoribbons is to change the first
peak of SDHC. Different from the situation of GDYs and armchair nanoribbons,
the first peak of SDHC in zigzag nanoribbons reduces first with the
increase of strain and then gets enhanced slightly. This behavior
also agrees with the trend of TC versus strain of zigzag nanoribbons.
From the above SDHC analysis, we can see that the strain mainly affects
the low-frequency phonon transport, regardless in 2D structure (GDY)
or nanoribbons. The low-frequency SDHC variation governs the TC of
strained structures.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion,
we have studied the thermal transport phenomena
in GDY and its nanoribbons using NEMD. The TC in GDY is isotropic
while large anisotropy appears in nanoribbons with the TC of the armchair
nanoribbon much larger than that of the zigzag nanoribbon. The anisotropic
transport in nanoribbons arises from the different phonon boundary
scattering, which hinders significantly the high-frequency phonon
transport (>3 THz) as demonstrated by the SDHC. The TC of both
armchair
and zigzag nanoribbons can be further reduced by attaching side chains
onto the nanoribbon edges, which can stop the phonon transport at
low frequencies (<3 THz), thanks to the resonant mechanism. The
TCs of GDY and armchair nanoribbons possess a different strain response
from that of zigzag nanoribbons. The TC of GDY and armchair nanoribbons
increases with tensile strain first and then reduces with the further
increase of strain. However, the TCs of zigzag nanoribbons decrease
with strain first and then keep almost unchanged. This difference
originates from a different response of low-frequency phonon with
strain. In GDY and armchair nanoribbon structures, the SDHC below
4 THz increases first with strain and then reduces, whereas for zigzag
nanoribbons, it decreases with the applied strain, which is in accordance
with the strain response of TC.
