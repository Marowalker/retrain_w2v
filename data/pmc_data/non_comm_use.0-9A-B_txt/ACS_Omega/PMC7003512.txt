Recently, the development
of pressure sensor devices composed of
mechanically flexible materials has gained a tremendous attention
for emerging wearable electronics applications. Compared with various
sensing materials, piezoelectric composite materials provide a characteristic
advantage of enabling energy unit-free integration of sensor compartments.
In this study, we develop a new chemical method of synthesizing highly
functioning piezoelectric composite materials with electrostatically
reinforced heterogeneous interfaces to improve the voltage output
signal in all-printed sensor arrays. The surfaces of piezoelectric
oxide nanoparticles are decorated subsequently with a cationic polyelectrolyte,
polyethyleneimine, and a tri-block copolymer, styrene–ethylene/butylene–styrene
grafted with maleic anhydride. To elucidate the factors determining
the performance of pressure sensor devices, both the electrical properties
and piezoelectric characteristics are investigated comprehensively
for various compositional composite materials prepared from chemical
and physical rubbers. The resulting device exhibits a sensitivity
of 0.28 V·kPa–1 with a linear increment of
output voltage in a pressure range up to 30 kPa. It is also demonstrated
that the all-printed sensor array is fabricated successfully by a
multistack-printing process of conductive, insulating, and piezoelectric
composite materials in an additive manufacturing fashion.

1 Introduction
Deformable pressure sensors comprising flexible functional constituent
materials can collect physical signals and quantify electrical signals
from human activities.1,2 By virtue of their versatile potential
for application in personal electronic devices and monitoring systems,
flexible pressure sensors have received tremendous attention regarding
their application in various wearable platform technologies, including
human–machine interfaces, soft robotics, e-skin, and medical
diagnosis.3−7 Conventional pressure sensors, composed of stiff materials, are
generally unsuitable for such future applications. Pressure levels
measurable in sensor devices can be categorized into four regimes,
namely, ultra-low pressure, subtle pressure, low pressure, and medium
pressure.1,8 Low pressure, ranging from a single-digit
kilopascal to a few tens of kilopascals, is of particular importance
in the monitoring of human activities and healthcare in daily life.
The development of self-powered sensor systems is another prerequisite
for solving the power consumption issue in various upcoming integrated
systems.

To date, poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) derivatives
have been
incorporated as a flexible piezoelectric layer, owing to their easy
capability of being casted in the form of thin film.9−12 However, their sensor performance is limited to some extent in comparison
with inorganic piezoelectric materials, and PVDFs are difficult to
be formulated into the inks that are suitable for various coating/printing
techniques because of their limited solubility even in good solvents.
The inorganic piezoelectric materials that exhibit excellent piezoelectric
performance suffer from inherent mechanical brittleness. Recent efforts
have been made to form flexible composite materials consisting of
inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) and elastomers to resolve these issues.13−18 This colloidal approach is also advantageous in formulating the
fluids applicable to specific printing techniques, as their rheological
properties can be manifested, depending on the solid content in a
polymer-incorporated suspension.

The practical potential of
flexible piezoelectric composite materials
has been demonstrated with recent developments of high-performance
piezoelectric energy harvesters;19,20 however, highly
functioning pressure sensor devices, employing piezoelectric composite
materials, have been limitedly reported. In order for improving the
sensor device performance, the strategies for forming spatially confined
domain structures21,22 and adjusting a spatial arrangement
of inorganic filler particles23 have been
suggested in piezoelectric composite materials. However, excellent
device performance was reported with an ultra-thin pure inorganic
layer that can be flexible without imposing a high level of strain,
exhibiting a sensitivity of 0.018 V·kPa–1 and
a detectable range (in a linear trend) of 30 kPa.24 A common way of synthesizing composite materials for pressure
sensor devices is simply mixing inorganic piezoelectric NPs with the
poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), which is widely used in various stretchable
applications, as an elastomer.14−16,19,20 To date, a study of establishing chemically
reinforced heterogeneous interfaces between NPs and elastomers has
been hardly reported, even with its importance in effectively delivering
the stress provided from outer surroundings into piezoelectric inclusions.
More importantly, even if the composite-based fluid is easily accessible
to mask-free, inexpensive, large-area processable printing processes,
most studies have not suggested a strategy for generating a position-addressable
sensor array.

In this study, we have developed a new method
of directly printing
a high-performance piezoelectric pressure sensor array on a flexible
substrate. A composite material is designed to have chemically reinforced
interfaces between piezoelectric filler NPs and thermoplastic tri-block
copolymers as an elastomer. This strengthened interaction between
both compartments in composites allows for a uniform dispersion of
inorganic NPs with much higher density as well as an efficient stress
transfer to piezoelectric inorganic fillers with a number of junction
interfaces. The multistacked array device is fabricated by the sequential
printing process of piezoelectric, conductive, and insulating composite
materials, using a 3-axis programmable dispensing machine without
the involvement of any additional deposition/patterning processes.
The fabricated device shows a sensitivity of 0.28 V·kPa–1 in a pressure range of 1–30 kPa.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Basic Electrical Properties
of Various Elastomeric
Polymers
Scheme 1 shows the procedure of formulating multistack printable composite
pastes and fabricating the sensor devices. We investigated the piezoelectric
composite materials comprising the lead zirconate titanate (PZT) NPs
and various elastomeric polymers (EPs). The PZT NPs endow a pressure-sensitive
piezoelectric property to composite materials, and the EPs provide
mechanical flexibility to overcome a drawback of piezoelectric ceramics.
The phase purity and morphology of the PZT NPs are shown in Figure S1. The pristine PZT NPs were mixed with
EPs, PDMS, or thermoplastic tri-block copolymers of styrene–isoprene–styrene
(SIS), styrene–ethylene/butylene–styrene (SEBS), and
SEBS grafted with maleic anhydride (SEBSm). For PDMS, the ratio of
prepolymer to curing agent was varied with values of 10:1, 20:1, and
30:1. To induce chemically reinforced heterogeneous interfaces between
PZT NPs and EPs, we synthesized electrostatically functionalized PZT
particles using polyethylenimine (PEI) and SEBSm. The chemically designed
SEBSm–PEI-PZT NPs were mixed with a mixture of SEBS and SEBSm.
For a highly conductive conductor paste, Ag flakes were mixed with
PDMS and either 1,3-dichlorobenzene (DCB) or terpineol as a solvent.
The basic properties of the composite materials were evaluated with
all solution-processed bar-coated devices. Then, all-printed arrays
were fabricated using a mask-free, three-axis programmable dispensing
machine.

Scheme 1 Schematic of the Fabrication Procedures of the Bar-Coated Device
and Multistack-Printed Array Device
First, we evaluated the leakage current level for various EP-based
metal–insulator–metal (MIM) devices to clarify whether
they could withstand the high electric field applied during the poling
process. Figure 1a
shows the current densities at 2 MV/cm for the PDMS, SEBSm, SEBS,
and SIS elastomers. For the PDMS and SEBSm elastomers, the low current
densities were measured of ∼10–12 and 10–9 A/cm2 at 2 MV/cm, respectively; however,
both SEBS and SIS elastomers do not block the currents penetrating
through them even at low electric fields (Figure S2). At the electric field of 0.06 MV/cm, applied during the
poling process in this study, the low leakage densities were measured
of 3.6 × 10–11 and 2.8 × 10–9 A/cm2 for the PDMS and SEBSm elastomers, respectively
(Figure S3). The PDMS is a kind of chemical
rubber that does not possess a partial-melt soft segment; it tends
to be used as an insulating layer in the thin-film transistor (TFT)
architecture.25,26 In thermoplastic physical rubbers,
a soft segment with extremely low glass transition temperature is
indispensable for endowing a stretchable property to polymeric structures.27,28 Interestingly, even if tri-block copolymer EPs of SIS, SEBS, and
SEBSm have a similar chain structure, including polystyrene as a hard
block segment, their leakage current behaviors vary widely depending
on the nature of the soft block segment. The polystyrene is also another
common insulating polymer used as a highly functioning dielectric
in TFT.29,30 Thus, the leakage current behavior observable
in SIS, SEBS, and SEBSm films may be determined by the chemical/physical
nature of the soft block segment, which can be partly evaluated with
the glass transition temperature (Tg).
However, as seen in Figure 1b, there is no significant difference in Tg for all tri-block copolymer EPs, in comparison with
that, 100 °C, for polystyrene. The values of Tg were measured to be −58.4, −53.6, and
−52.9 °C for SIS, SEBS, and SEBSm films, respectively.

Figure 1 (a) Current
densities at an electric field of 2 MV/cm for MIM devices
employing PDMS, SEBSm, SEBS, and SIS insulator layers; (b) glass transition
temperatures and (c) stress–strain curves for PDMS, SEBSm,
SEBS, and SIS films; (d) variations in the voltage signal as a function
of pressure level in pPDMS and pSEBSm devices.

Variation in the compositional amount of the soft block segment
can be another determining factor. This is directly related to how
easily an elastomer is stretched under a given stress condition, which
is represented by the elastic modulus. As seen in Figure 1c, the elastic moduli of the
SIS, SEBS, and SEBSm films were measured to be 2, 11, and 20 MPa,
respectively. This trend corresponds well to the leakage current results.
Thus, we hypothesize that for the SEBSm layer, the compositional amount
of soft segment is low enough to block the leakage current, whereas
the SIS layer has an excessive amount of soft segment and in turn,
does not show a proper insulating property. In particular, for the
SIS-based MIM device, the upper Ag electrode was vacuum-deposited
because of such a softness in the film structure; when the Ag composite
electrode was cured at temperatures over 120 °C, the SIS films
did not maintain their morphology. Note that, the PDMS film, a chemical
rubber, has a quite low value of 0.8 MPa in elastic modulus,
although it exhibits extreme insulating behavior. In this regard,
to date, most piezoelectric composite materials have been studied
with the use of PDMS rather than tri-block copolymer EPs with compositional
variation.

2.2 Bar-Coated Sensor Devices
Employing Pristine
Piezoelectric NPs
The bar-coated devices employing PDMS,
SIS, SEBS, and SEBSm-based pristine PZT composite layers are denoted
as pPDMS, pSIS, pSEBS, and pSEBSm devices, respectively. As expected,
for the pPDMS and pSEBSm devices, a poling voltage of 1 kV could be
applied without any degradation of the electrical property. A low
poling voltage of 10 V was applied to the pSEBS device, and the pSIS
device was electrically short even at a voltage of 1 V (Figure S4). Figure 1d shows the voltage output as a function
of pressure level in the pPDMS and pSEBSm devices. The recorded real
data are shown in Figure S5. For both devices,
the voltage output was measured with a value approaching merely to
0.3 V and was saturated at a pressure level as low as 5 kPa. The matrix
polymer plays a critical role of transferring the stress imposed by
outer surroundings as well as providing mechanical flexibility to
the composite material. These factors would be affected by the elastic
modulus of the matrix polymer. However, as seen in Figure S6, in the pPDMS devices prepared from the PDMS EPs
with different elastic moduli, the voltage output characteristics
did not vary significantly. This implies that a loss in imposing the
stress at heterojunctions between piezoelectric NPs and polymers is
much more critical than the aforementioned parameters.

2.3 Bar-Coated Sensor Devices Employing Electrostatically
Functionalized Piezoelectric NPs
We designed the surface-functionalized
piezoelectric NPs comprising the subsequent PEI and SEBSm layers (Figure 2a). The hydroxyl-terminated
surface of oxide particles is protonated in the acidic aqueous medium
with the generation of positively charged one, −OH2+, and deprotonated in the basic aqueous medium with a
generation of negatively charged one, −O–.31 For the PZT NPs used in this study,
the surface zeta potential values were measured to be 36.2, −6.9,
−22.5, and −37.5 mV at the pH values of 2, 7, 10, and
12, respectively (Figure 2b). The PEI, a cationic polyelectrolyte with an amine-abundant
chemical structure, tends to maintain its positive zeta potential
even under a highly basic pH condition.32 By simply mixing the pristine PZT NPs and PEIs in an aqueous medium
with the pH of 10, the positively charged PEI polymers bind electrostatically
to the surface of negatively charged PZT particles. This is confirmed
by the fact that the zeta potential of PEI-treated PZT NPs changed
to the positive value of 25.3 mV at the pH of 10 (Figure 2b).

Figure 2 (a) Schematic of showing
the electrostatically functionalized SEBSm–PEI-PZT
NPs. (b) Variation in zeta potential as a function of pH for pristine
and PEI-PZT NPs and (c) photographs showing the dispersion stability
in water and dichlorobenzene for pristine and SEBSm–PEI-PZT
NPs. (d) FT-IR spectra for pristine PZT, PEI-PZT, and SEBSm–PEI-PZT
NPs. The arrows represent the major chemical groups described in the
manuscript. The chemical reaction between the amine group in PEI and
the maleic anhydride in SEBSm is shown below the figure. (e) TEM image
and compositional mapping data for SEBSm–PEI-PZT NPs.

The SEBSm polymer comprising maleic anhydride groups
can undergo
a vigorous chemical reaction with the amine group. Thus, electrostatically
assembled SEBSm–PEI-PZT NPs are easily obtainable with a facile,
simple mixing procedure at room temperature in air. As seen in Figure 2c, the hydroxyl-terminated
pristine PZT and PEI-PZT NPs are dispersed well in water, while the
SEBSm–PEI-PZT NPs are dispersed in 1,3-dichlorobezene, owing
to the polar nature of PEI polymer and the nonpolar nature of SEBSm
polymer. The multilayered surface functionalization was also confirmed
by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectral analysis
(Figure 2d). Both pristine
PZT and PEI-PZT NPs have a shoulder peak because of the stretch mode
of O–H bonds at a wavenumber around 3000–3500 cm–1, commonly observable in polar surfaces. In the spectrum
for PEI-PZT NPs, a characteristic peak at 1600 cm–1 is observed because of the bend mode of N–H bonds in the
amine groups. In the spectrum for SEBSm–PEI-PZT NPs, the shoulder
peak at 3000–3500 cm–1 vanished, with an
evolution of the C–N stretch peaks in amide bonds at 950–1250
cm–1 and in aromatic amine at 1250–1330 cm–1.33 Uniform surface functionalization
was confirmed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) imaging and the compositional mapping data for the SEBSm–PEI-PZT
NPs (Figure 2e). The
SEBSm–PEI-PZT NPs were well-dispersed in tri-block copolymer
matrices, owing to excellent chemical compatibility, as seen in Figure S7. As seen in the cross-sectional scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) image (Figure S8), no morphological defects were observable even after tearing the
film in a liquid nitrogen bath.

We fabricated bar-coated sensor
devices using the SEBSm–PEI-PZT
NPs instead of pristine PZT NPs. The bar-coated device prepared from
the piezoelectric composite layer employing the SEBSm–PEI-PZT
NPs and a mixture of SEBS and SEBSm is referred to as the fSEBS/SEBSm
device in this study. When the ratio by weight of SEBS to SEBSm is
7:3, that is described as the fSEBS(7)/SEBSm(3) device. Unexpectedly,
the fSEBS(0)/SEBSm(10) device suffered from a low reproducibility
because of a leakage current problem. SEBSm itself is a highly insulating
polymer, as seen in Figure 1a,b; thus, this poor insulating property is attributable to
the presence of a number of polar groups inside the composite layers.
When both PEI and SEBSm polymers are reacted with the surface −O– groups of pristine PZT NPs and the amine groups of
PEIs, respectively, they would experience a steric hindrance effect,
leaving behind the unreacted OH groups (at neutral pH) and amine groups.
It is well-known that these polar groups act as trap/de-trap sites
where electrons can hop through them.34 The thermoplastic tri-block SEBSm polymer can wet the surface of
NPs during drying at elevated temperature, encapsulating such polar
groups. However, the softness of SEBSm polymer is not sufficient to
cover them completely compared with those of SIS and SEBS EPs.

To encapsulate them more effectively, we used a mixture of SEBS
and SEBSm as an elastomeric matrix. As seen in Figure 3a, with increasing the composition of SEBS
up to 70 wt %, the output voltage as a function of pressure level
was improved significantly, which may be attributed to the restricted
loss of electric field in the fSEBS/SEBSm device. However, when the
composition of SEBS increased to 90 wt %, the device performance deteriorated
because of excessive incorporation of leaky SEBS polymer. The voltage
outputs at 10 and 30 kPa are summarized in Figure 3b for all fSEBS/SEBSm devices. The fSEBS(7)/SEBSm(3)
device exhibited the best performance with the output voltage of 0.8
V at a pressure of 30 kPa and the sensitivity of 0.28 V·kPa–1 in a pressure range up to 30 kPa. The real data for
given pressure conditions are shown in Figure 3c. This performance was obtained from the
piezoelectric composite layer with a filler composition of 80 wt %.
When less inorganic NPs were incorporated, the piezoelectric performance
was degraded (Figure S9). The long-term
stability of the fSEBS(7)/SEBSm(3) device was confirmed by repeated
measurement at a pressure level of 30 kPa without a significant degradation
in output voltage (Figure 3d). As seen in Figure S10, it was
also clearly observed that the voltage signal is detectable right
after applying an external pressure on top of the sensor device, without
a critical time delay issue. This piezoelectric performance is achievable
with a sophisticated design of chemically reinforced heterogeneous
interfaces between NPs and elastomers, the level of which is comparable
to that of the device fabricated from the transferred ultra-thin pure
PZT thin film.24

voltage signal as a function of pressure
level and (b) values in the voltage signal at pressure conditions
of 10 and 30 kPa in fSEBS/SEBSm devices. Output voltage data measured
in the fSEBS(7)/SEBSm(3) device (c) at various pressure levels from
1 to 30 kPa and (d) at a pressure of 30 kPa during 2000 test repetitions.

In general, along the surfaces of inorganic NPs,
chemical sites
are present where PDMS can be anchored at elevated temperature. Oxide
particles have inherent hydroxyl groups, and the PDMS prepolymer can
undergo a temperature-dependent reaction with the hydroxyl groups,
forming oxygen bonds between them.35 However,
the population density of hydroxyl groups on the oxide surface is
not enough to trigger a full surface-coverage reaction. The surface
of oxide film is usually oxygen plasma-treated to generate more hydroxyl
groups;36 however, a uniform plasma treatment
along the surface of irregular-shaped particles is highly demanding.
The chemical modifiers, PEI and SEBSm, used in this study are polymeric
substances. Many amine groups (from PEI) can be anchored on the limited
number of surface hydroxyl groups. Subsequently, a number of maleic
anhydride groups (from SEBSm) can be anchored on the abundant amine
groups. This enables a relatively high surface-coverage reaction with
a number of chemical bonds. All treatment procedures in this study
were carried out in a solution phase, which would allow for uniform
chemical reactions along the surface of NPs.

For demonstration
as a pressure-sensing unit, the fSEBS(7)/SEBSm(3)
device was attached around the neck of a human subject (Figure 4a,b). A tiny movement of the
“Adam’s apple” was monitored with speaking and
swallowing motions. Distinct electrical signals were obtained while
the vowels of [a], [e], and [i] spoke (Figure 4c). Figure 4d shows an evolution of electrical signals by gentle
and mild finger-tapping motions. The repeated signals were measured
with gentle and mild tapping motions. As seen in Movie S1, a very gentle touch pressure was measurable with
clear voltage signals. A pressure difference in gentle and mild tapping
motions was distinguishable clearly with a difference of ∼3
V in output voltage (Movie S2). Capability
of measuring a very tiny pressure was also demonstrated by dropping
an object weighing only 0.6 g, from the height of 0.4 mm on top of
the pressure sensor device. The vertically falling movement of a very
light object was measured with an evolution of the output voltage
approaching the value of 4.6 V. In particular, a subtle motion, observed
immediately after the object landed, was also monitored in almost
every single case.

2.4 Three-Dimensional
Multistack-Printed, Self-Powered
Pressure Sensor Array
Figure 5a is the schematic showing the sequential printing
procedure of one sensor part in a 3D multistack-printed array device.
An easy way of facilitating the multistack-printing process is to
formulate the printable paste with a resistance against gravitational
force, which can be evaluated by the values of viscosity and yield
stress.37 As another prerequisite, such
a thick fluid should undergo a gradual decrease in viscosity in relation
to the shear rate to ensure appropriate extrusion during the nozzle-based
printing process. For the conductive paste, the solid loading of Ag
flake and polymer was regulated from 92 to 97 wt % to formulate a
highly viscous, thick fluid. As seen in Figure 5b, the high value of 1.2 × 106 mPa·s in viscosity was measured at a low shear rate, with the
value of 290 Pa in yield stress, and then, it decreased to the value
of 764.8 mPa·s with increasing a shear rate up to 1000 s–1. In comparison, the two-dimensional screen printable
paste has the value of ∼104 mPa·s in viscosity,
which is less by a factor of ∼102 than that of the
thick paste formulated in this study.

process
for fabricating the all-printed piezoelectric pressure sensor array;
(b) rheological properties of the multistack-printable paste formulated
in this study; (c) photograph of the all-printed sensor array device.
The scale bar in (c) is 10 mm. (d) Position-addressable voltage output
signals measured by a gentle tapping motion on the printed array device.

For the PZT composite paste, a multistack-printable
thick paste
can be formulated by dispersing well the sophisticatedly surface-functionalized
inorganic NPs in a limited amount of solvent. However, air bubbles
tend to be trapped in the as-printed layer and are not removed with
ease from the pseudo-solid-like wet layer. Alternatively, we printed
an insulating bank layer for defining the spatial area where the PZT
paste is printed. This method is also advantageous in generating the
uniform layer. In overlapping laterally the lines to make a film,
a thinner fluid enables to a formation of the even top surface. For
printing the bank layer, a viscous PDMS prepolymer was chosen instead
of the conventional one, and the same PZT composite paste was used
as the one used in bar-coated devices. The rheology properties of
the viscous PDMS prepolymer and PZT composite paste are shown in Figure S11. The insulator part was also printed
using the viscous PDMS prepolymer for blocking the current flow between
adjacent electrode lines. The motion picture showing all printing
procedures is seen in Movie S3. As seen
in Figure S12, the top Ag electrode lines
were formed well along the surface of ∼110 μm thick insulator
part and ∼85 μm thick sensor part.

Figure 5c shows
a photograph of the complete multistack-printed array device. The
output voltage as a function of pressure is shown in Figure S13. The sensitivity of 0.15 V·kPa–1 was measured with an output voltage of 0.21 V at a pressure of 10
kPa, which is slightly lower than that of the bar-coated device. The
electrical property of the piezoelectric composite layer sandwiched
with lower and upper electrode layers can be mainly influenced by
the value in capacitance and the thickness of the dielectric composite
layer, as long as the kind of piezoelectric filler is identical. In
both bar-coated and printed array devices, the composition of filler
particles inside the composite was not altered; thus, it can be presumed
that a variation in thickness results in the change in output voltage
under given pressure conditions. Controlling the thickness in a uniform
film structure is achievable by adjusting the rheological properties
of the printable fluid and the processing conditions, namely, parameters
in the printing process. More improvement in output voltage in the
printed array will be carried out with more delicate preparation of
multistack printable pastes and further adjustment of processing variables.
Note that, all-printed, self-powered pressure sensor arrays have been
rarely reported to date. Most studies have not designed the adequate
filler particles and elastomeric matrices that enable for printed
piezoelectric composite layers. It is also attributable to the difficulty
of fabricating a multistacked device architecture by a sequential
printing process. As seen in Figure 5d, in the fully addressable array device, individual
output voltage signals were obtained clearly when gentle pressure
was imposed on top of designated pixels.

3 Conclusions
We have developed a chemical method of functionalizing chemically
the surface of PZT NPs for establishing the electrostatically reinforced
heterogeneous interfaces in the piezoelectric composite materials.
Through a basic investigation of electrical properties on various
chemical and physical elastomers, the SEBSm polymer was chosen as
an appropriate elastomeric matrix that can be stable during a high-voltage
poling process. The bar-coated devices prepared from SEBSm–PEI-PZT
NPs and a mixture of SEBS and SEBSm EPs exhibited a voltage output
of 0.8 V at a pressure of 30 kPa, with a linear sensitivity of 0.28
V·kPa–1 in a wide pressure range. The all-printed,
self-powered pressure sensor array was also fabricated by carrying
out the multistack-printing process of conductive, insulating, and
piezoelectric composite pastes.

4 Experimental
Details
4.1 Raw Materials
PZT (DPSC-1, Ceracom),
Ag flake (1–2 μm, SF-120, Ames Goldsmith Corporation),
PDMS (Sylgard 184, Dow Corning), SIS (styrene: 22 wt %, Aldrich),
SEBS (Mw: 89,000, Aldrich), and SEBSm
(Aldrich), PEI (Mw: 750,000, Aldrich),
DCB (98%, Alfa Aesar), and terpineol (95%, Aldrich) were used without
further purification. The commercially purchased PZT particles were
ball-milled to prepare nanosized PZT particles prior to experiments.

4.2 Preparation of Conductive Composite Pastes
Ag flakes were mixed with a mixture of PDMS prepolymer and a cross-linking
agent (ratio by weight = 10:1). The DCB was added and mixed uniformly
using a planetary centrifugal mixer (ARE-310, THINKY Corp.). The filler
composition of Ag flakes was 92 wt % in a dried film. For the top
electrode paste, the DCB was replaced with terpineol to prevent the
dissolution of the underlying piezoelectric composite layer. The solid
loading of Ag flakes and PDMS was 92 wt % for the paste for the bar-coating
process. For the multistack-printable Ag composite paste, the solid
loading was regulated up to the value of 97 wt %.

4.3 Preparation of Piezoelectric Composite Pastes
Piezoelectric
pastes were prepared with two kinds of PZT NPs. One
was pristine PZT NPs, and the other was PZT NPs functionalized chemically
with PEI and SEBSm, denoted as SEBSm–PEI-PZT NPs. The pristine
PZT NPs were mixed with the elastomer (PDMS, SIS, SEBS, or SEBSm)
and DCB, using a planetary centrifugal mixer. The SEBSm–PEI-PZT
NPs were synthesized as follows. The PZT NPs were stirred for 60 min
in an aqueous PEI solution with the pH of 10 and washed with basic
deionized water and ethyl alcohol by a centrifugation technique. The
resulting particles were stirred for 30 min in the SEBSm–DCB
solution and washed with the toluene using a centrifugation technique.
The obtained SEBSm–PEI-PZT NPs were mixed with a mixture of
SEBS, SEBSm, and DCB using a planetary centrifugal mixer. In all pastes,
the solid loading of PZT NPs and elastomer was 42 wt %, and the filler
composition of PZT NPs/(PZT NPs + elastomer) was 80 wt %.

4.4 Fabrication of MIM Devices for Measuring the
Leakage Current
Aa 50 nm-thick Cr/Ag bottom electrode was
deposited by thermal evaporation on a Si wafer substrate. PDMS, SIS,
SEBS, and SEBSm polymer solutions were prepared by mixing with DCB
at concentrations of 75, 12, 20, and 10 wt %, respectively. The solutions
were spin-coated at a speed of 3000 rpm, followed by thermal annealing
at 100 °C for 1 h. Then, the Ag composite paste (solvent: terpineol)
was printed and cured at 120 °C for 4 h to complete the PDMS,
SEBS, and SEBSm-based MIM devices. For the Ag–PDMS composite
electrode, variation in electrical conductivity as a function of curing
temperature is shown in Figure S14. The top Ag electrode was evaporated for the SIS-based one.

4.5 Fabrication of Bar-Coated Pressure Sensor
Devices
The DCB-based Ag conductive paste was bar-coated
on a polyimide (PI) substrate (thickness (t) = 75
μm, Kapton film 300HN, Teijin DuPont Films) with a PI tape side
bank (thickness: 125 μm) and cured at 120 °C for 4 h. Then,
the piezoelectric pastes were poured on top of the Ag electrode layer
with an Ecoflex side bank and dried at room temperature for 2 h and
at 100 °C for 1 h. Subsequently, the terpineol-based Ag conductive
paste was bar-coated on top of the piezoelectric composite layer with
the PI tape side bank and cured at 120 °C for 4 h. The coating
speed was 10 mm/s. The film thickness of piezoelectric composite and
Ag electrode layers were ∼180 and ∼85 μm, respectively.
Both the bottom and top electrode layers were connected with Cu wires
and silver epoxy. The poling process was carried out at a voltage
of 1000 V for 10 min at room temperature. The voltage output data
for the best pressure sensor device are shown in Figure S15 before/after a poling process.

4.6 Fabrication of Multistack-Printed Pressure
Sensor Arrays
The printing process was conducted with a three-axis
programmable dispenser (Image Master 350PC Smart, Musashi) on the
PI substrate. First, the Ag composite paste was printed using a nozzle
with an inner diameter of 200 μm under a back pressure of ∼200
kPa on top of the PI substrate. A thermal treatment was carried out
at 120 °C for 4 h. The bank layer for confining the spatial area,
where the piezoelectric paste is deposited, was formed by printing
the viscous PDMS prepolymer (Sylgard 186, Dow Corning) mixed with
a cross-liking agent (pre-polymer/cross-linking agent = 10:1 w/w).
The inner diameter of the nozzle was 200 μm, and the back pressure
was 150–200 kPa. The insulator part was also formed by printing
the corresponding PDMS mixture. The PDMS parts were cured at 100 °C
for 1 h. Then, the PZT composite paste was printed inside the predefined
PDMS bank layer using the nozzle with an inner diameter of 330 μm
at a back pressure of ∼20 kPa, followed by a drying process
at room temperature for 2 h and at 100 °C for 1 h. The printing
speed was 1 mm/s. The film thickness of piezoelectric composite and
Ag electrode layers were ∼150 and ∼140 μm, respectively.
Finally, the terpineol-based Ag composite paste was printed along
the surface of the preformed multilayers and thermal-treated in the
same manner as the bottom electrode.

4.7 Characterization
The piezoelectric
performance of the sensor devices was measured using an oscilloscope
(MDO 3054, Tektronix) and a force gauge (M7-10, Mark-10 Corp.) equipped
with a step motor controller (ECOPIA). Pressure was applied to the
sensor devices at a pressing rate of 30 mm/s, analogous to that in
human activities in our daily lives. The morphologies of the particles
and films were observed by SEM (Sigma HD, Carl Zeiss), and the crystal
structures of the particles were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD,
D/Max-2200V, Rigaku). The surface charge of the particles was measured
with a zeta-potential analyzer (ELS-Z, Otsuka), and the chemical groups
of functionalized particles were investigated by FT-IR spectroscopy
(Carry 5000, Varian). The glass transition temperature was measured
by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC Q1000, TA). The leakage
current behaviors were measured with a semiconductor parameter analyzer
(E5270B, Agilent) equipped with a probe station. In measuring the
electrical properties, the patterned upper electrodes were formed
by a dispensing printing process of Ag paste or by a thermal evaporation
of the Ag metal through the metal mask. The sheet resistance was measured
with a 4-point probe (RSD-40K, DASOENG).
