Nanostructured
electrodes effectively enhance the kinetics of the
charge/discharge process in lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries. However,
the fabrication of these electrodes often involves complex processing
steps. This study demonstrates a one-step improved flame spray pyrolysis
synthesis approach to directly deposit the most common Li-ion battery
cathode material LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 onto current collectors, which is identified as reactive
spray deposition technology (RSDT). Because of the economical and
continuous nature of RSDT, the industrial scale of manufacturing nanostructured
electrodes for Li-ion batteries can be potentially developed. Morphologies
of the electrodes are well controlled so that their electrochemical
properties can be tailored to accommodate intended applications. In
detail, by adjusting the precursor concentration in the solution feed
during the operation of RSDT, the specific surface area of synthesized
material can be fine-tuned accordingly. Although the electrodes prepared
with low precursor concentration exhibit the highest surface area
and deliver the highest initial discharge capacity of 192.1 mAh g–1, the most stable cycling performance is demonstrated
by the electrodes fabricated with high precursor concentration, retaining
93.6% of the initial capacity after 100 cycles in half-cell testing.
This innovative direct deposition method considerably simplifies the
manufacture process of high-performance nanostructured electrodes
and enables effortless modification of their properties. Moreover,
no hazardous waste is generated from this synthesis route.

Introduction
Until recent years, LiCoO2 with
layered structure has
been the most widely applied cathode material in commercial lithium-ion
(Li-ion) batteries due to its good cycling stability.1 However, high toxicity, high cost, and low practical capacity
associated with this material considerably limit its scope of applications.2 To satisfy the need for novel cathode materials
with enhanced properties to accommodate their use in portable electronics
and plug-in electric vehicles, LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 with high reversible capacity and good thermal
stability has been developed to replace LiCoO2.3 It has the same crystal structure (α-NaFeO2 type with R3m symmetry)
as that of LiCoO2.4 The valences
of nickel, manganese, and cobalt ions are +2, +4, and +3, respectively.5,6 The redox couples of Ni2+/Ni4+ and Co3+/Co4+ are active during the intercalation/de-intercalaction
of Li ions, whereas the Mn4+ ions stay electrochemically
inactive.7−9 Consequently, the dissolution of manganese and Jahn–Teller
distortion can be avoided, leading to a more stabilized structure
during the charge/discharge cycling. In addition, little cation disorder
and insignificant volume change are observed in LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 from the insertion
and extraction of Li ions.10−12 However, further improvements
in the performance of battery electrodes based on this active material
are urgently needed to support the applications in advanced portable
electronics and electrical vehicles. One of the effective strategies
for achieving higher specific capacity and better rate capability
is by engineering nanostructured LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 electrodes, as the diffusion lengths
of electrons and ions are considerably reduced in this type of electrodes,
so the kinetics of lithium storage can be effectively enhanced.13

State-of-art synthesis methods for the
preparation of nanostructured
LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 electrodes
are coprecipitation,14 spray pyrolysis,15 electrospinning,16,17 hydrothermal,18 and sol–gel.19 However, there are several shortfalls associated with these methods,
such as complex time-intensive steps, irregular morphologies, and
high equipment cost. Reactive spray deposition technology (RSDT),
a flame combustion synthesis method in the open atmosphere, presents
a superior alternative to fabricate the nanostructured electrodes.
It is a single-step continuous process, offering the advantages of
cost-efficiency and scalability. In addition, the high combustion
heat from the flame provides in-situ annealing to the electrodes and
thus eliminates the need for postdeposition heat treatment.

The low-cost precursor materials (i.e. nitrates and acetylacetonates)
and the highly combustible organic solvents (i.e. ethanol and xylene)
are typically used to prepare the precursor solutions for RSDT. The
atomization of the precursor solution creates a spray of aerosol droplets
that are ignited to form a jet-diffusion flame. The precursors rapidly
decompose in the high-temperature flame, followed by phase transition
to vapor and homogeneous reactions to form the nanosized oxide particles.
The particle formation and growth generally take place via the following
mechanisms: homogeneous reactions, nucleation, coagulation, surface
growth, cluster formation, coalescence, agglomeration, and aggregation.20 The nucleation and growth of the primary particles
occur during time-of-flight. The synthesized materials are directly
deposited onto the current collectors to form the electrodes. The
intermediate steps required in the conventional pyrolysis and the
conventional slurry-based electrode fabrication process are eliminated
by RSDT. In addition, since the binder material is not required in
this process, the energy density of the electrodes can be increased
and the cost of the electrode fabrication can be reduced. More importantly,
RSDT enables the effective control of the material properties via
manipulation of the processing conditions. For example, by adjusting
the precursor concentration, the synthesized material can be fine-tuned
to the desired surface morphology and particle size distribution.
In addition, no hazardous waste is generated from this synthesis route
due to the complete combustion of the organic materials.

In
this study, nanostructured LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 electrodes are fabricated by RSDT.
By varying the precursor concentration in the solution feed, the physical
and electrochemical properties of the electrodes are modified accordingly.
Crystal structures of the synthesized materials are analyzed by X-ray
diffraction (XRD). Surface morphologies and microstructures of the
electrodes are investigated by means of scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Electrochemical
properties of the as-prepared electrodes are evaluated by cyclic voltammetry
(CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge cycling, and electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS).

Results and Discussion
XRD Analysis
XRD
patterns of the nanostructured LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 electrodes
prepared by RSDT are shown in Figure 1. They can be indexed to the hexagonal lattice structure
of α-NaFeO2 with R3m space group.3,4,21 No
identifiable secondary phase can be detected. The intensity ratios
of the (003) and (104) peaks (I(003)/I(104)) are calculated as 2.05, 1.64, and 1.39
for NMC-1, NMC-2, and NMC-3, respectively. The ratios are well above
the critical value of 1.2, indicating a highly ordered layer structure
with minimal degree of cation mixing between Li+ and Ni2+.22 In the meantime, the value
of I(003)/I(104) becomes smaller (slightly higher cation mixing) when the precursor
concentration in the feed solution increases. It suggests that higher
concentration of the reactant species in the flame is more likely
to induce cation mixing in the as-synthesized LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2. The doublet peaks of (006)/(102)
and (108)/(110) are observed in each of the diffraction patterns,
which are resulted from the distorted c-axis in the
FCC structure of the oxygen sublattice.23,24

Microscopic Analysis
Surface morphologies of the nanostructured
LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 electrodes
are shown in Figure 2a–f. The uniform distribution of the cauliflower-shaped aggregates
of the nanoparticles with interconnected pores on the current collector
can be observed. As the precursor concentration increases, the aggregate
size tends to gradually increase, coupling with a decrease in the
specific surface area of the electrode material. The nitrogen adsorption/desorption
isotherms of the as-synthesized LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 are shown as the inset images in Figure 2a–c, which
correspond to the less-defined type IV with the hysteresis loops that
are characteristic to the mesoporosity in the materials. The measured
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface areas
are 48.4, 22.9, and 9.8 m2 g–1 for NMC-1,
NMC-2, and NMC-3, respectively. The primary mechanisms that account
for the particle growth in the flame are coagulation and coalescence.
It is expected that higher precursor concentration increases the initial
concentration of particles in the flame, leading to a higher coagulation
rate and higher degree of sintering.25 As
a result, larger and more compact aggregates with lower specific surface
area are deposited on the current collector. In the meantime, the
electrode appears less porous with higher precursor concentrations.
Upon closer inspection, no cracks or significant morphology variation
can be detected in the electrodes, which suggests that the organic
solvents are fully combusted before the particles reach the substrates.

TEM images of LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 nanoparticles are shown
in Figure 2d–f.
The aggregates are primarily
consisted of spherical nanoparticles. Sheet particles with lattice
fringes can be observed, demonstrating high crystallinity. It also
shows a trend of increasing primary particle size with higher precursor
concentration. The estimated primary particles sizes are in the range
from 3 to 16 nm for NMC-1, 5 to 21 nm for NMC-2, and 7 to 32 nm for
NMC-3. As the primary particles are formed via the coagulation of
nuclei and/or monomer followed by complete sintering, an increase
in the precursor concentration leads to higher initial particle number
concentration and collision frequency, which together drive a higher
rate of coagulation.26 Consequently, larger
primary particles are produced. Subsequent collisions between the
primary particles with partial sintering (necking between particles)
leads to the formation of aggregates.26 Higher precursor concentration results in larger aggregates due
to a faster sintering rate from more frequent collisions and more
point contacts between the primary particles.25

Electrochemical Properties
CV curves of the nanostructured
LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 electrodes
in the voltage window between 2.8 and 4.5 V are shown in Figure 3a. All of the samples
demonstrate good electrochemical activity in the applied voltage window.
Each type of the electrodes shows one pair of redox peaks that correspond
to the redox reactions of Ni2+/Ni3+/Ni4+ followed by Co3+/Co4+ during the intercalation/deintercalation
process of Li+ ions.24 No reduction
peak of manganese with oxidation state of +4 is observed. These characteristics
are consistent with those of the typical CV curves of LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 electrodes found in
the literature.24,27 Minor difference in the kinetics
between the insertion and the extraction of  Li+ ions
can be observed from the slightly higher anodic peaks than the cathodic
peaks. Although the redox peaks of the electrodes appear to be symmetric,
the peak separation enlarges with lower precursor concentration, which
is 0.67, 0.49, and 0.36 V for NMC-1, NMC-2, and NMC-3, respectively.
Smaller peak separation is an indication of better reversibility.28 Thus, NMC-3 has the highest reversibility among
the three samples.

fabricated
by RSDT with different precursor concentrations: (a) CV curves in
the potential range between 2.8 and 4.5 V at the scan rate of 1.0
mV s–1; (b) cycling performance at 0.5 C in the
potential range between 3.0 and 4.5 V; (c) galvanostatic charge/discharge
curves for the 1st, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 100th cycles; (d) rate capabilities
from 0.5 to 10 C.

Figure 3b shows
the specific discharge capacities and the corresponding Coulombic
efficiencies of the nanostructured LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 electrodes fabricated by RSDT as a
function of the cycle number, which are obtained galvanostatically
in the voltage window between 3.0 and 4.5 V. NMC-1 delivers the highest
initial specific discharge capacity of 192.1 mAh g–1, but it also shows more pronounced capacity fading with a retention
ratio of 68.9% at the end of 100 cycles. Although NMC-3 delivers the
least initial specific discharge capacity among all three samples,
which is 171.9 mAh g–1, it demonstrates the most
stable cycling performance with a capacity retention ratio of 93.6%.
In addition, the initial specific discharge capacity and the capacity
retention ratio over 100 cycles of NMC-2 are 185.9 mAh g–1 and 85.5%, respectively. The Coulombic efficiencies of the first
charge/discharge cycle are 76.8, 83.9, and 90.7% for NMC-1, NMC-2,
and NMC-3, respectively. It shows that NMC-1 suffers the most significant
loss of the reversible capacity during the first cycle, which can
be attributed to its high specific surface area resulting in the excessive
side reactions with the electrolyte. However, the Coulombic efficiencies
of all of the samples quickly increase after the initial cycle and
maintain above ∼98% after the fifth cycle. The charge/discharge
curves of the nanostructured LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 electrodes are shown in Figure 3c, which correspond to the typical behavior
of the layered LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 reported in the literature.3,7 The sloped
plateaus stem from the redox couples of Ni2+/Ni3+ and Ni3+/Ni4+ during the charge/discharge
process. The obtained electrochemical testing results suggest that
high surface area of the nanostructured LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 electrodes fabricated by RSDT is beneficial
for enhancing the initial specific discharge capacity, which is due
to increased contact area with the electrolyte, increased accessibility
to the active sites, and increased utilization of the electrode capacity.
However, there is more significant capacity loss associated with high
surface area since a larger portion of the active materials are subjected
to side reactions with the electrolyte solution.13 Consequently, there is a trade-off that needs to be made
between the high initial discharge capacity and the cycling stability.
In addition, the electrochemical performance of the nanostructured
LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 electrodes
fabricated by RSDT is comparable to or superior to those reported
for the state-of-the-art LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 cathode materials prepared by both the pyrolysis/combustion
route and the wet chemistry synthesis methods (Table 1). Hence, it demonstrates the feasibility
of employing RSDT to prepare the high-performance nanostructured electrodes
for the application in Li-ion batteries.

Rate capabilities of the
as-prepared LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 electrodes are investigated by galvanostatic
cycling at the stepwise increased discharge current rates from 0.5
to 10 C. The corresponding results are shown in Figure 3d. It can be observed that the specific discharge
capacities of the electrodes decrease gradually as the discharge rate
is increased from 0.5 to 10 C. NMC-2 demonstrates the best rate performance
compared with other samples, retaining a high capacity of 92.2 mAh
g–1 at 10 C, which is 49.8% of the capacity at 0.5
C. It also recovers 97.1% of the capacity when the current rate returns
to 0.5 C. Modestly high specific surface area and small particle size
are likely contributing factors to the excellent rate capability.
The contact area between the electrode and electrolyte is sufficiently
increased, whereas the diffusion path lengths for both electrons and
ions are reduced. In comparison, NMC-3 with lower surface area and
larger secondary particle size delivers a lower discharge capacity
of 77.6 mAh g–1 at 10 C, which is 45.4% of the capacity
at 0.5 C. Surprisingly, NMC-1 that exhibits even higher surface area
and smaller particle size compared to those of NMC-2 performs poorly
in the rate capability test. It only delivers a specific discharge
capacity of 67.6 mAh g–1 at 10 C, which is 35.4%
of the capacity achieved at 0.5 C. It is likely that the excessive
side reactions (i.e., acid/base reactions and transition-metal dissolution)
from large surface area of the active material in direct contact with
the electrolyte solution give rise to increasing electrode resistance
and lead to the accelerated loss of capacity.13,29

To reveal the resistance changes of the nanostructured LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 electrodes
before and after the galvanostatic cycling, EIS measurements and equivalent
circuit analysis are performed. Nyquist plots before and after 100
charge/discharge cycles are displayed in Figure 4a,b. The sum of the intrinsic resistances
of the electrode material and the cell components, the contact resistance
between the active material and the current collector, and the ionicresistance
of the electrolyte is represented by the intercept on the Z′ axis in the high-frequency region, which is denoted
by RΩ. The semicircle in the high-intermediate
frequency region refers to the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) at the electrode/electrolyte interface and
the diffusion resistance (Rf) of Li+ ions through the surface films (i.e., solid electrolyte interface).
The constant phase elements (CPE1 and CPE2)
that represent the non-ideal capacitance of the surface films are
used for the modeling of the depressed semicircle. The Warburg diffusion
(Zw) is reflected by the sloping straight
line in the low frequency region, which corresponds to the solid-state
diffusion of Li+ ions in the bulk of the electrode material.42,43 The single semicircle present in the high-intermediate frequency
region suggests that Rct is the dominating
resistance over Rf. The increase in the
diameter of the semicircle is observed for all three samples, which
corresponds to a higher charge-transfer resistance. From Table 2, it shows that there
is significant increase in both Rf and Rct of NMC-1. Meanwhile, NMC-2 has seen a less
amount of increase in Rf and Rct, whereas the resistance growth in NMC-3 is the least.
These changes observed in the impedance measurements clearly indicate
that the sample with higher external surface area suffers from considerably
larger impedance increase upon galvanostatic cycling. Higher surface
area is more susceptible to the detrimental side reactions with the
electrolyte solution. The decomposition of the electrolyte salt (i.e.,
LiPF6) generates hydrofluoric acid that attacks the bare
LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 and
leads to the dissolution of transition-metal ions into the solution.29,44 It is likely that the highly resistive LiF is formed on the surface
of the active materials, which blocks the charge transfer between
the particles and retards the kinetics of the electrochemical reactions.25,45 This leads to the accelerated capacity fading during the charge/discharge
cycling and the inferior rate performance. The EIS measurements can
serve as an explanation to the cycling performance and the rate capability
of the nanostructured electrodes synthesized by RSDT. However, the
degree of transition-metal ion dissolution and the quantification
of the resistive species have not been determined, which requires
further research work.

Conclusions
Nanostructured
LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 electrodes
with the interconnected pore network are
fabricated in one step by RSDT. This innovative synthesis method presents
a pathway to the simple and rapid manufacturing of high-performance
nanostructured electrodes for Li-ion batteries. XRD analysis indicates
a layered structure with minimal cation mixing of the samples fabricated
by RSDT. Electron microscopy analysis demonstrates the structural
homogeneity of the as-prepared electrodes. The specific surface area
of the electrode material can be well controlled by adjusting the
precursor concentration in the solution feed, which in turn tailors
the electrochemical properties of the electrode. Low precursor concentration
leads to the electrodes with high surface area, whichexhibit a high
initial specific discharge capacity of 192.1 mAh g–1. However, the pronounced capacity fading is also observed. In comparison,
the most stable cycling performance is demonstrated by the electrodes
fabricated with high precursor concentration, which exhibit low surface
area and retain 93.6% of the initial capacity after 100 charge/discharge
cycles. While the high specific surface area of the electrode material
can effectively enhance the specific discharge capacity due to increased
accessibility to the electroactive sites and higher utilization of
the electrodes, the excessive side reactions with the electrolyte
are detrimental to the cycling stability of the electrodes. Future
studies will explore the option of depositing a protective surface
coating (i.e., metal oxides) on top of the active material to alleviate
the detrimental effects from the electrolyte decomposition and to
enhance the cycling performance of the electrodes with high surface
area.

Experimental Section
Fabrication of Nanostructured LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 Electrodes by RSDT
Nanostructured
LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 electrodes
were fabricated by RSDT. The instrument setup and the operating procedures
of RSDT have been previously described in detail.20,46−49 The stoichiometric amount of acetylacetonates of lithium, nickel,
manganese, and cobalt (Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved into 50:50 wt
% methanol/xylene (ACS reagent grade, Sigma-Aldrich) solvent mixture,
which was formulated according to a preliminary solubility study.
The precursor concentrations used to prepare the electrodes for comparison
study are 15, 30, and 45 mM, and the corresponding electrodes were
denoted as NMC-1, NMC-2, and NMC-3. Water bath sonication was employed
to obtain a clear solution. The precursor solution was filled into
a pressure vessel. Sulfur-free liquid propane (Airgas East Inc.)
was then added to the pressure vessel, which accounted for 18.5 wt
% of the final solution. The solution was pumped through a capillary
line to a custom-designed atomization nozzle at a flow rate of 6.0
mL min–1. The atomization of the solution and the
size reduction of the droplets exiting the nozzle were assisted by
the supercritical expansion of the propane. The induction heating
was provided to increase the temperature of the solution to 50–60
°C before reaching the nozzle. The precursor solution exited
the nozzle in the form of aerosol spray which was ignited by six pilot
burners surrounding the nozzle to form a jet-diffusion flame. The
main flame was supported by the high-purity oxygen (Airgas East Inc.)
at a flow rate of 10 L min–1 and sustained by the
pilot burners that were consuming the premixed methane (Airgas East
Inc., 0.85 L min–1) and oxygen (Airgas East Inc.,
0.85 L min–1). The mass flow controllers (Alicat
Scientific) were used to control the flow of the gases. The flame
was enclosed by a quartz shroud to limit the dissipation of the combustion
heat. Stainless steel current collectors were mounted on a custom-made
substrate holder for the deposition of the synthesized material to
form the nanostructured electrodes, which was secured on a computer-controlled
motion platform that was programmed to follow a serpentine raster
pattern to ensure the uniform deposition. During the operation of
RSDT, a zero-diffraction silicon substrate was also mounted on the
substrate holder to collect the synthesized materials for XRD analysis.

Physical Characterization
Structural and phase analysis
of the as-synthesized LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 were carried out by a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer,
which had a monochromatic Cu Kα (λ = 1.5451 Å) radiation
and a LynxEye detector. Surface morphologies of the LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 electrodes were investigated
using FEI Quanta 250 FEG that had a field emission source. Transmission
electron microscope (TEM) images were acquired on a FEI 200 kV probe-corrected
Metrios DX S/TEM.  The particle size distributions were obtained
by the analysis of the TEM images using the image processing software
ImageJ. TEM samples were prepared by scrapping the active material
off the electrode, dispersing in ethanol, and drop-casting onto 400
mesh copper grids that have ultrathin carbon film on lacey carbon
support film (Ted Pella Inc.). The grids were dried in ambient environment
overnight. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area
measurements of the samples were performed by Micromeritics ASAP2020
surface area analyzer using nitrogen as the adsorbent at 77 K. The
samples were degassed at 200 °C under vacuum before performing
the measurements.

Electrochemical Measurements
The
as-prepared LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 electrodes
were assembled into CR2032 type two-electrode coin cells (diameter
20 mm, height 3.2 mm) as the working electrodes. Microporous polyethylene
membranes (Celgard 2400) were used as the separators, and pure lithium
foils were used as both the counter electrodes and the reference electrodes.
The mass loadings of the active materials were controlled between
0.8 and 1.0 mg. Lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6, 1 M)
dissolved in a mixture of ethylene carbonate, diethyl carbonate, and
dimethyl carbonate was used as the electrolyte. The coin cells were
assembled in an argon-filled glovebox. The cells were galvanostatically
charged and discharged in the voltage window of 3.0–4.5 V vs
Li/Li+ at multiple C-rates by means of a multi-channel
Arbin battery tester. CV measurements were taken at scan rate of 1.0
mV s–1 in the voltage window of 2.8–4.5 V
vs Li/Li+ by Solartron 1287 Potentiostat. EIS was conducted
on a Gamry Reference 600 Potentiostat at the frequency range from
0.5 MHz to 0.1 Hz.
