Solid/liquid heterogeneous photocatalysis
was often considered
to occur on the active sites of a solid catalyst surface. Herein,
we report that the selectivity of photocatalytic dehydrogenative oxidations
of aliphatic primary alcohols in acetonitrile solution into corresponding
aldehydes exhibits an anomalous relationship with adsorption behavior
of the alcohols. By using Pt-loaded TiO2 photocatalyst
in an inert atmosphere under UV light illumination, primary short-chain
alcohols (SCAs) with strong adsorption were dehydrogenated into aldehydes
in very poor selectivity, whereas weak-adsorbable long-chain alcohols
(LCAs) were transformed into corresponding aldehydes with much higher
selectivity. More than 20 examples of primary LCAs (C4–C10) were successfully transformed into their corresponding
aldehydes with satisfactory selectivity and yield. Both solid-state
magic-angle-spinning 13C NMR and attenuated total reflectance–Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy studies provided concrete differences
in adsorption behaviors on the Pt–TiO2 photocatalyst
surface between SCA ethanol and LCA n-octanol. To
further uncover the mechanism for different selectivities of SCAs
and LCAs in photodehydrogenation, in situ electron paramagnetic resonance
(EPR) experiments (at 8 K temperature) were employed to observe the
oxidation features of photogenerated hole in the valance band of Pt–TiO2 (hvb+). The EPR experimental studies
exhibited that unlike ethanol, either n-octanol or
solvent acetonitrile alone all could not scavenge photogenerated hvb+ on Pt–P25 photocatalyst and only n-octanol dissolved in acetonitrile solvent could smoothly
react with photoinduced hole. This indicated that selective oxidations
of LCAs were achieved by solvent-delivered oxidation rather than directly
destructive oxidation of photogenerated hvb+. Our results may open an alternative way in selective dehydrogenative
oxidation of various substrates sensitive to both dioxygen and high-temperature
treatments.

1 Introduction
As
an environmentally benign photocatalyst, titanium dioxide has
been widely used in dye-sensitized solar cells, water splitting for
H2 evolution, and environmental remediation.1−6 Under UV light irradiation, the photoinduced hole in the valence
band (hvb+) and electron (ecb–) in the conduction band migrate to the surface of
TiO2 and are available for different redox reactions. For
the hvb+, its redox potential is about 2.7 V
[vs normal hydrogen electrode at pH = 1] and can oxidize nearly all
of the C–H bonds of organic compounds, even those of the most
inert hydrocarbons such as CH4 under room temperature.
This powerful catalytic ability to initiate C–H bond activation
is certainly expected to create huge opportunities for settlement
of diverse troubles of transformations of inert C–H, C–C,
and C–X bonds in organic synthesis under mild conditions. However,
the potent application of TiO2 photocatalysis in current
organic synthesis has not been fully developed.7−10 There are many causes such as
very poor photoquantum yield and unavailable UV light sources, but
the most concrete challenge needed to overcome is the universally
low selectivity. On the one hand, in photocatalytic synthesis process,
reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydroxyl radical, superoxide
radical anion, and hydroperoxide radical generated from photogenerated
hvb+/ecb– with
H2O and O2 often deteriorate the selectivity
by overoxidation and even mineralization of both substrates and products.10−17 On the other hand, because the TiO2 surface is highly
hydrophilic, polar molecules could have an effective interaction with
the TiO2 surface. There have been many works and insights
into the oxidative mechanism of polar substrates such as methanol,
ethanol, and propanol in diverse TiO2 suspending solution
systems under irradiation. In these polar substrate cases, photogenerated
hvb+ is well-known for its major role to dictate
which path a reaction initially follows with substrates before adsorbing
on the TiO2 surface. Notwithstanding, for these polar substrates
in aqueous solution, the readily adsorbed solvent H2O also
reacts with photogenerated hvb+ competing with
polar substrates to produce the hydroxyl radical (•OH). This
secondary oxidative species is entangled in the surface and bulk solution
reaction, often makes the oxidation process more complicated, and
leads to low selectivity.18 Nonpolar hydrocarbons
especially long-chain aliphatic compounds do not easily react on TiO2 by interfacial ET (electron transfer) as adsorbed polar substrates
do. Generally, they have to be activated in an indirect pathway through
diffusive ROS from the surface to the bulk solution.19,20 Because of the high reactivity of the diffusive ROS such as •OOH
or O2•– as well as •OH
radical in TiO2 photocatalysis, there are few successful
transformations of nonpolar substrates,18−22 compared to some special polar organic molecules
such as Boc-proline and other cyclic carboxylic acids,23−26 benzyl amine,7,27−29 pyridine,30 benzyl alcohol,31−41 and diazonium.12 Therefore, it is definitely
worth trying to determine whether there is another character for selective
transformation of nonpolar substrates besides the well-known ROS in
TiO2 photocatalysis.

Herein, we report a solvent-mediated
ET pathway involving photoinduced
hvb+ oxidation in the Pt–TiO2 photocatalytic system. In this way, nonadsorbable long-chain alcohols
(LCAs) (C4–C10 primary alcohols) in the
anhydrous acetonitrile solvent and under anaerobic condition can be
dehydrogenated into corresponding aldehydes and H2 with
high selectivity and conversion; by contrast, the photocatalytic oxidation
of primary short-chain alcohols (SCAs), which are well-known to be
readily adsorbed on Pt–TiO2, exhibits very poor
selectivity. Through in-detailed attenuated total reflectance Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR–FTIR) and magic-angle-spinning
(MAS) 13C NMR studies to compare the differences in adsorptivity
on the Pt–TiO2 photocatalyst surface between primary
LCAs and SCAs, we confirm that the photodehydrogenation selectivity
for aldehyde was in the contrary trend with its adsorption ability
on the photocatalyst surface. Furthermore, electron paramagnetic resonance
(EPR) experiments at 8 K temperature provided distinct features of
solvent-mediated photogenerated hvb+ dehydrogenation
pathway of LCA to explain its satisfactory selectivity. This finding
may provide an alternative method to tune the oxidation ability of
photogenerated hvb+ to realize challenging C–H
bond activation for diverse synthetic purposes.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 C-Number-Dependent Selectivity
First,
we chose n-octanol as a model compound of nonadsorbable
primary LCA and tested its photodehydrogenation under different TiO2 photocatalysis conditions. Under aerobic (in the air) and
aqueous conditions, as expected, the reaction occurred rapidly on
P25 TiO2 under UV light irradiation but with very poor
selectivity for octaldehyde transformation (entry 1 in Table 1). The poor selectivity is highly
consistent with previously reported works1 and is attributed to the high oxidation ability of photoinduced
ROS in the presence of both H2O and O2. Similarly,
there was no yield with acetonitrile as the solvent and under anaerobic
and anhydrous conditions (entry 2 in Table 1) and on other types of TiO2 photocatalysts
(entry 3 and 4 in Table 1). However, when Pt–TiO2 instead of TiO2 was used as the photocatalyst and the reaction was carried out in
extra dry acetonitrile under anaerobic argon atmosphere, the selectivity
and yield of octaldehyde were dramatically improved to 81 and 78%,
respectively (entry 5 in Table 1), simultaneously generating hydrogen gas (see entry 2 in Table 2). The distinct H2 evolution along with the production of target product octaldehyde
confirms that this photocatalytic reaction is indeed a dehydrogenation
oxidation of n-octanol. By contrast, it sharply dropped
to ∼5% yield once O2 was introduced into the system
(entry 6 in Table 1). This evidences that ROS is indeed detrimental for the synthetic
purpose in this transformation.

In addition, different
solvents were chosen to perform the reactions
under otherwise identical conditions (entry 7–12 in Table 1). Generally, polar
solvents exhibited higher yields than nonpolar solvents, indicating
that the closer to the hydrophilic Pt–TiO2 surface
the solvent is, the higher the selectivity and yield of the photodehydrogenation
of n-octanol are.

We screened different Pt-loadings
(0.1, 0.75, 2, and 5% of Pt by
weight percentage, Table 2) on the TiO2 surface for this transformation and
found that 0.75% Pt-loading provides the best catalytic performance
from the perspective of both octaldehyde and H2 yield.
Therefore, in the following experiments, we used 0.75% Pt–P25
as our photocatalyst.

Moreover, blank reactions were performed
to confirm the necessary
condition for this dehydrogenative oxidation reaction. The results
are shown in Table 3. When the reaction was run in the dark, neither substrate conversion
nor product formation was observed. When platinum black or Pt/C was
used in the place of Pt–TiO2 photocatalyst under
the standard reaction condition, n-octanol also could
not be converted. Octaldehyde formation did not occur at all. When n-octanol was absent in the reaction mixture, we could not
detect H2 evolution in the GC-thermal conductivity detector
(TCD) mode. These control group experiments all lead to the conclusion
that this reaction was photodehydrogenative oxidation catalyzed by
Pt–TiO2.

In opposition
to successful transformation of n-octanol, when ethanol
was dissolved in acetonitrile solvent and
introduced to the Pt–P25 TiO2 suspending system
for 1.2 h illumination, little or no acetaldehyde could be obtained,
although ethanol was totally consumed. We used 1H NMR spectra
(Figure 1) to observe
the transformation of ethanol in this case because reactants, products,
and the acetonitrile solvent commonly interfered with each other in
the determination by GC. From Figure 1B, except CD3CN and benzene internal standard
in NMR spectrum, there were neither product aldehyde peaks nor substrate
alcohol peaks when substrate ethanol was entirely converted. However,
CH3 peak of acetic acid was overlapped by H peak signal
of the solvent CD3CN residue, and −COOH peak could
not be observed because of fast proton exchange with H2O proton in the deuterated solvent. Thus, both the product and the
reactants were not observed in the case that substrate ethanol was
completely converted. To avoid over-reaction, we intentionally ended
the reaction at 0.5 h irradiation and really found the residue peaks
corresponding to ethanol and the newly formed acetaldehyde (Figure 1A). However, the
aldehyde yield was far from the conversion of ethanol in this case,
demonstrating simultaneous degradation of both substrate ethanol and
product aldehyde. Despite avoiding the well-known complete oxidative
degradation pathways of alcohol in the presence of O2 and
H2O, SCAs still could not be selectively converted into
corresponding aldehydes even under anaerobic and nonaqueous conditions.
This indicates that the easily adsorbed alcohol as well as the formed
corresponding aldehydes could be directly attacked by continually
photogenerated hvb+, which causes nonselective
cleavage of all C–H, C–C, and even C–O bonds,
all the same as aerobic reactions. By contrast, initially unadsorbed
or very weakly adsorbed LCA could not directly react with photoinduced
hvb+ on the interface, instead obtained very
high selectivity and yield.

With the optimal conditions of both photocatalytic reactions
and
determination of products in hand, the kinetic experiments of both
conversion of n-octanol (Figure 2A) and ethanol (Figure 2B) and the generation of the corresponding
target product aldehydes and H2 as well as the production
of byproducts were conducted. Kinetic measurements for ethanol transformation
were performed according to ref (42). From Figure 2A, the yield of the other main product, H2, very similar to octaldehyde, was basically kept consistent in n-octanol consumption against reaction times. Byproducts
such as small-molecule acids and CO2 were well below 20%.
Conversely, CO2 yield was high (over 80%), and aldehyde
yield was closer to zero as ethanol conversion was closer to 100%.
H2 evolution was not comparable to that of the n-octanol case. The results of the product profile for both
LCA and SCA dehydrogenation further demonstrated that there was a
crucial difference in the photocatalytic route between the two cases.

The reaction conditions are identical to those in Table 1a.
Aldehyde is denoted as squares, H2 is denoted as circles,
alcohol is denoted as blue triangles, acid is denoted as cyan triangles,
and CO2 is denoted as purple triangles.

We argued that this phenomenon was not attributed
to the stability
difference in their structure between LCA and SCA substrates themselves,
instead, depended on their adsorption ability because the C(sp3)–H or C(sp3)–C(sp3) bonds of SCA are generally not more facile
to be broken than those of LCA if only considering its binding energy.
To confirm this argument and extend the scope of substrates, we chose
different primary alcohols including linear-chain fatty primary alcohol
and β-substituted aliphatic primary alcohols (Table 4), aromatic alcohols (Table 5), and heteroatom
alcohols (Table 6)
to examine such an anomalous dependence of selectivity upon adsorption.
From Table 4, we found
a general trend: The selectivity and yield of target aldehyde from
transformation of linear-chain primary alcohol significantly increased
with the increase of C-number of alcohols from C1 to C4 (1a–1d in Table 4) and achieved stable yield no less than 71% from C4 to C10. Lengthening C-chain can enhance the hydrophobicity
of linear-chain alcohol and significantly change the distribution
property between the solvent and polar TiO2 surface (for
detailed results, see MAS 13C NMR section), which avoids
the direct oxidation by photoinduced hvb+ on
TiO2 surface and gains high selectivity. Second, steric
hindrance did not decrease the selectivity and yield of this photodehydrogenation
reaction for branched primary alcohols once their C-number over 4.
Branched primary alcohols that have a single methyl group substituted
in either β- or γ-position and double methyl groups substituted
in β-position were smoothly converted into corresponding aldehydes
in more than 80% yield. In addition, the bond dissociation energy
of tertiary C–H bond is at least 5–6 kcal/mol less than
that of primary C–H ones.43 However,
1l and 1m that contain tertiary C–H bonds still had satisfactory
yield compared with other LCAs. Even the steric cumbersome tert-butyl group did not show reduced reaction selectivity
(1o–1q in Table 4). Generally, branched alcohols are more difficult to undergo selective
dehydrogenation because the alkyl branch group augmented steric hindrance,
which hampers the oxidant or catalyst to approach the alcohol hydroxyl
moiety. To our delight, all of the eight branched alcohols exhibited
excellent reactivity and satisfactory selectivity in our catalysis
system compared with their linear analogues. In addition, the yield
for C4 alcohol 2-methyl-1-propanol (1k) was as high as
93%, which is unprecedented in previous oxidation systems for C4 aliphatic primary alcohol.

As
for dehydrogenation of aromatic alcohols (Table 5), benzyl alcohol was transformed to benzaldehyde
with >99% yield as previously reported even under aerobic oxidation.31 On the contrary, when 2-phenylethanol was subjected
to the dehydrogenation conditions, we did not obtain any phenylacetaldehyde
as half of the alcohol was converted but only detected 17% toluene
and 27% bibenzyl byproducts. More interestingly, when 3-phenylpropanol
and 4-phenylbutanol were subjected to otherwise identical condition,
the normal aldehyde products were formed in good yield (2c and 2d
in Table 5). As aliphatic
C-numbers over 2, both the electron-donating and the electron-withdrawing
substitute on the aryl ring of 3-phenylpropanol proceeded with high
selectivity. This aliphatic C-number-depending selectivity and reactivity
are highly analogous to the dehydrogenation of acyclic aliphatic alcohols
mediated by Pt–TiO2 photocatalyst except that of
benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol exception should be attributed to benzyl
carbon exhibiting more sp2-C characteristic rather than
pure sp3-C of aliphatic alcohol such as methanol through
a significant aromatic ring π-electron delocalization.41

To further demonstrate the universality
of this unconventional
trend of loaded Pt–P25 photodehydrogenation reaction for primary
alcohol, we turn our attention to primary alcohol with a heteroatom
functional group because heteroatom groups commonly invalidate catalytic
efficiency because of facile coordination to the catalyst.44−47 The results are shown in Table 6; as expected, C2 glycolic acid reacts sluggishly,
providing glyoxylic acid with only 33% yield and 59% selectivity on
56% conversion (3b in Table 6). However, ethyl glycolate reacts especially well under the
optimized condition, yielding ethyl glyoxylate in 84% yield and as
high as 98% in selectivity on 86% high conversion (3c in Table 6). This result again
agrees with the anomalous trend between polarity and selectivity.
In addition, because of the importance of amino-containing compounds
in natural products and pharmaceuticals, Boc-prolinol
was subjected to the optimized photodehydrogenation condition and
exhibited satisfactory selectivity. For the strongly coordinative
O-heterocyclic compound, 2-pyranyl-1-ethanol was also smoothly dehydrogenated
to 2-pyranyl acetaldehyde with good selectivity and moderate yield.

2.2 C-Number-Dependent Interaction between Primary
Alcohols and Pt–TiO2 Determined by MAS 13C NMR, ATR–FTIR, and EPR Spectra
The solid-state
(SS) cross-polarization (CP) MAS NMR technique was utilized to study
the adsorption of LCA such as n-octanol and SCA such
as ethanol. Generally, the half-width and the difference of 13C NMR chemical shift parameters were measured to characterize the
adsorptive interaction between the adsorbed organic compound and the
solid catalyst. The chemical shift corresponds to the structure of
adsorbed species, and every carbon atom within one substrate molecule
can be identified as compared with the normal 13C NMR signal
in CCl4 solution.48 The mobility
of adsorbed substrates on the solid surface determines the signal
half-widths. From these attributions in the SS NMR spectrum, one could
clarify the degree of adsorptive interaction between organic adsorbate
and the solid catalyst surface and the closeness of the carbon atom
within one molecule to the surface. For example, when benzene as a
well-known nonpolar and hydrophobic organic compound was set on a
highly hydrophilic TiO2 surface, its half-width in MAS 13C NMR is 37.5 Hz. By contrast, when a highly polar phenol
molecule is loaded on the TiO2 surface, its half-width
of the signals is up to 130 Hz.48 Thus,
the broadened half-width can be used as diagnostic parameters to quantitatively
see the interaction of any carbon atom within one molecule with the
catalyst surface. In the present work, we examined n-octanol and ethanol adsorbed on TiO2 and Pt–TiO2 surfaces, respectively, by MAS 13C NMR (Figure 3) and the data of
half-width for each of their C atoms were examined and listed in Table 7. Clearly, the half-width
of C1 of ethanol is much wider than that of every C atom
of n-octanol (Figure 3). From Table 7, it roughly exhibited that the interaction of n-octanol with 0.75% Pt–TiO2 catalyst, which we
used in the photocatalytic reactions, could be negligible because
the half-widths of its every C atom is similar to those of benzene
on the TiO2 particle.

a Cx stands
for the position of the carbon shown above.

Furthermore, in P25 case, although the half-width
of every carbon
atom of n-octanol is not large, the half-width from
C6 to C8 is less than that of C1–C5 of n-octanol, which suggests that the n-octanol molecule may be placed far from the TiO2 surface and stick up far from the surface on C5, leading
each carbon among C6–C8 to share a similar
half-width. This trend for an LCA molecule approaching the TiO2 surface was not changed even if the TiO2 surface
was loaded by different amounts of Pt nanoparticles (0.1–5%
by weight). The loaded Pt percentage on the TiO2 surface
does not essentially alter the weak interaction between n-octanol and the surface but results in distinguishable difference
in closeness to the surface. When 0.1–2% Pt was loaded on the
surface, the half-width of C1 within n-octanol is significantly narrowed relative to that of TiO2 without loading Pt. However, the half-width of C1 is
the narrowest on the 0.75% Pt–P25, which suggests that n-octanol has the weakest interaction with this photocatalyst.
Considering that the best dehydrogenation selectivity and yield were
gained on 0.75% Pt–P25 photocatalyst, we propose that the least
adsorptive interaction provides the highest selectivity. In contrast
with n-octanol, the C1 peak in the ethanol
molecule is drastically widened to 81.0 Hz when ethanol is adsorbed
on P25, and Pt-loading did not reduce significantly the half-width.
However, the half-width for C2 of ethanol is very similar
to that of n-octanol, indicating that it is ethanol
C1 adsorbing on the TiO2 surface. All of these
observations suggest that the significant difference in half-width
between LCA and SCA determined by 13C MAS-NMR spectra was
of enough sensitivity and repeatability to quantitatively represent
the interaction between the substrate and TiO2 surface.

Besides half-widths, chemical shifts of n-octanol
and ethanol as well as their differences (Δx) of the 13C chemical shifts between alcohols on
the TiO2 surface and in CCl4 solution were also
examined by MAS 13C NMR on the TiO2 suspending
system (Table 8). The
Δx value in CP MAS 13C NMR spectra reflects the change of the electron density for each
carbon atom of the adsorbate molecule between free and affected circumstances
because the chemical shift reflects the shielding effect of the magnetic
field depending on the electron density. For example, on the P25–TiO2 surface, the Δx value delivered
from very weak adsorption of benzene molecule is 127.5 Hz. In contrast,
strongly adsorbed phenol exhibits large Δx values of 292.5 Hz.48 The stronger
polarity the molecule possesses, the larger the interaction with TiO2 polar surface, which leads to a larger Δx value. For our photocatalytic system, although n-octanol has a hydrophilic hydroxyl group, all peaks of
C1 to C8 in 13C MAS-NMR spectrum
showed very small Δx value for both
P25–TiO2 and Pt–P25 samples, and the maximum
Δx value was less than 100 Hz despite
of some regular fluctuations of Δx values of C1–C8. Comparing it to 127.5
Hz for benzene on TiO2 particles previously reported, this
well-illustrated interaction feature of n-octanol
on TiO2 and Pt–TiO2 solid was very weak
and could be completely neglected. By contrast, SCA ethanol exhibited
233 Hz of Δx value in 0.75% Pt–P25
sample, which demonstrates the strong interaction between ethanol
and Pt–P25 and the reliability of this characterization method.

To have
a better insight into the nature and extent of adsorption,
surface-sensitive ATR–FTIR investigations are carried out for
SCA ethanol and LCA n-octanol on the Pt–P25
surface (see Figure 4). The signals of LCA n-octanol in CH3CN solution on Pt–TiO2 film in ATR–FTIR
were too weak and hard to discern from the baseline, whereas the signals
of ethanol in CH3CN solution under otherwise identical
condition were very strong. The typical OH group of alcohol at 3314
cm–1, methyl group at 2936 and 2968 cm–1, and methylene group at 2854 and 2879 cm–1 for
ethanol on Pt–TiO2 were very consistent with the
examples previously reported. These observations indicated that SCAs
were readily adsorbed, whereas those LCAs were not.

of 0.01 mol/L ethanol (dark green line)
and n-octanol (black line) in CH3CN solution
on 0.75% Pt–P25 film.

Given the low tendency of LCAs to be adsorbed, how could
they be
dehydrogenated and transformed into corresponding aldehydes? That
is, which component or factor in this photocatalytic system plays
the key role to pass photogenerated hvb+ oxidation
from the interface of Pt–TiO2/liquid to the LCAs
in bulk solution? We speculated that it was solvent CH3CN that delivered the photogenerated hvb+ to
remote LCA molecules in the suspending solution via strong polarization
or redox process from one to the other until reaching the LCA molecule
through solvent relaxation dynamics.49 To
illustrate this possibility, we carried out low-temperature EPR experiments
to observe the possible reactions between photogenerated hvb+ and solvent molecule (Figure 5). According to the previous observation,50,51 the EPR signals with g > 2 (gz = 2.007, gy = 2.014, and gx = 2.024) were assigned to photogenerated hvb+ of anatase TiO2 and all of them could not be observed
if the temperature was over 100 K. Thus, we carried out all of EPR
determination at 8 K. When blank Pt–P25 powder was excited
by in situ 365 nm UV light, there are two major features: groups of
signals divided according to g < 2 and g > 2. The signals at g < 2 can be
assigned
to capture of electron on Ti sites. The sharp signal g⊥ = 1.990 and shoulder at g∥ = 1.957 (the parallel components of the spectra are
much weaker than the perpendicular components and are nearly not observed
in the P25 TiO2 sample) are the lattice electron-trapping
sites in anatase. The strong signal g = 1.975 and
shoulder 1.940 are the lattice electron-trapping sites in rutile.
The weak signal composed of three lines at g = 2.007, g = 2.014, and g = 2.024 is resonances
from the oxygen-centered surface hole-trapping sites. The anisotropy
of this signal is indicative of the low symmetry of the surface sites.
Our observed spectra agree well with those measured for P25 TiO2 samples and those measured for pure-phase samples.50,51 When we introduced ethanol on the surface of the Pt–P25 TiO2 sample, the signals at g = 2.025, 2.014,
and 2.007 were significantly eliminated under UV light irradiation.
This is highly agreed with the previously evidenced conclusion that
alcohol is well-known to efficiently scavenge the photogenerated hvb+. However, it was very surprising that the signals
arise from photogenerated hvb+ at g ≈ 2.007–2.025 did not eliminate at all as the same
amounts of n-octanol compared with ethanol were introduced
into the system. The intensity of these signals was nearly the same
as that of the pristine Pt–P25 TiO2 sample. This
strongly demonstrates that LCAs are not like SCAs such as ethanol
and do not scavenge these photogenerated holes. Instead, when we dissolved
the same amount of n-octanol in the CH3CN solution and introduced the solution into the Pt–P25 TiO2 sample for EPR determination, we found that the signals arise
from photogenerated hvb+ were at once eliminated,
similar to the case of ethanol. Conversely, the CH3CN solvent
itself without n-octanol does not eliminate the signals
of photogenerated hvb+. This undoubtedly demonstrated
that photogenerated hvb+ is neither removed
by CH3CN through irreversible oxidation of the CH3CN solvent nor directly transferred into the n-octanol
molecule. Only when n-octanol was dissolved in the
CH3CN solvent, the photogenerated hvb+ can be smoothly removed and n-octanol oxidized
into aldehyde.

under irradiation. Purple line signifies 2 mL of CH3CN

Given that there is a very significant difference
of adsorption
on the Pt–P25 surface between primary SCAs and LCAs, we propose
a possible explanation for this anomalous trend of selectivity depending
on C-chain length. Under the present conditions, the photocatalytic
system consists of the photocatalyst, acetonitrile solvent, and alcohol
substrate. According to the significant difference of CP MAS 13C NMR C1 half-width, ATR–FTIR adsorption
peaks of hydroxyl and alkyl chains, and removal features of photodegenerated
hvb+ between n-octanol and
ethanol, C1–H breaking and H-release of n-octanol should occur far from the Pt–TiO2 surface. This is remarkably different from the dehydrogenation of
adsorbed SCAs by directly photogenerated hvb+ at the interface, which commonly leads to overoxidation. Because n-octanol is not significantly adsorbed on the catalyst
surface, possibly the solvent acetonitrile mediated and passed on
hvb+ oxidation by hopping into the bulk solution
by a solvent relaxation dynamics rather than direct oxidation on the
surface as in the case of ethanol, as shown in Figure 6. Such a process would avoid the well-known
over-reaction and nonselective attack of photogenerated hvb+ and ensure the high selectivity and yield for the formation
of aldehydes. There had been a few paradigms about transformations
of nonpolar organic substrates in different solvents by photogenerated
hvb+, but it was always considered still an
interface oxidation as a nonpolar substrate was converted into a polar
intermediate and then readsorbed on the TiO2 surface.19,20 Obviously, the present work provides new perspectives and possibilities
to take advantage of powerful photogenerated hvb+ for selective organic synthesis purpose.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we exhibit an anomalous inverse relationship between
adsorption and selectivity for this heterogeneous photocatalytic reaction.
By this way, primary LCAs (C-number over 4) with poor adsorption on
the Pt–TiO2 catalyst can be successfully photodehydrogenated
into corresponding aldehydes with H2 evolution and demonstrated
a broad substrate scope. Primary SCAs exhibit good adsorption on the
Pt–TiO2 surface but with poor selectivity to corresponding
aldehydes. Through comparing the adsorptivity of primary LCA and SCA
by MAS 13C NMR characterization and ATR–FTIR and
directly correlating photogenerated hvb+ elimination
with both SCA and LCA by 8 K EPR measurements, we propose that this
anomalous phenomenon originates from a different oxidative power of
direct photogenerated hvb+ reaction on the catalyst
surface for adsorbed alcohol and indirect hopping oxidation associated
with acetonitrile-mediated solvent relaxation dynamics. This route
differs from the commonly well-known adsorptive reaction mechanism
for alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, and i-propanol
in the TiO2 photocatalytic dehydrogenation system. This
discovery provided novel knowledge and understandings for TiO2 photocatalysis.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
TiO2 (AEROXIDE
P25, anatase and rutile), acetonitrile (99.9+%, Extra Dry with molecular
sieves, AcroSeal, Acros), ethanol (99.5%, Extra Dry, absolute, AcroSeal,
Acros), and acetaldehyde (99.5%, extra pure, AcroSeal, Acros). Other
alcohols and aldehydes were purchased from Acros Co. Ltd., Innochem
Co. Ltd., J&K Chemicals Co. Ltd., ALFA Co. Ltd., TCI Co. Ltd.,
MP Co. Ltd., and Sigma Co. Ltd.

4.2 Reactor
and Light Source
The light
source used was a 300 W Xe Lamp (HXUV-300, Au-light, Beijing). Reactor
vessels were 10 mL Pyrex glass cylindrical bottles with sealable rubber
cap with magnetic stirring.

4.3 Preparation of Pt-Loaded
TiO2
Photodeposition was used to load metal (5,
2, 0.75, and 0.1 wt
%) Pt on TiO2 using hexachloroplatinic(IV) acid (99.9%)
as the Pt precursor. Bare TiO2 particles (1.0 g) were suspended
in aqueous solution (100 mL) containing Pt precursor and methanol
(5 mL) as hole scavenger, and the solution was degassed and irradiated
for 5 h with the 300 W Xe Lamp with magnetic stirring under argon
atmosphere at 298 K. After irradiation, the metal-loaded TiO2 particles were recovered by centrifugation at 10 000 rpm
and washed repeatedly with water and ethanol until the analysis of
the liquid phase using ion chromatography (IC) revealed that there
is no observable peak of chloride ion in the supernatant. The concentration
of chloride ion was measured using a DX-900 Ion Chromatograph with
an IonPac AS23 column (Dionex). The eluent for IC was 30 mM KOH solution,
the curb was 20 mA, and the flow rate was 0.7 mL/min. The identification
of Cl– ion by IC analysis was performed using an
observed retention time of approximately 9.3 min compared with the
commercial sample. After centrifugation and washing, Pt–TiO2 powders were dried at 333 K in vacuum for 12 h.

4.4 Material Characterizations
The morphology
of the as-synthesized photodeposited 0.75% by weight Pt–P25
sample was investigated by a microscopic technique. The powder catalysts
were dispersed in ethanol and drop-casted on Cu-grids. High-resolution
scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR-STEM) and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) analyses were conducted on a JEOL 2100F
transmission electron microscope with a 200 kV accelerating voltage.
HR-STEM and TEM images were collected for Pt–P25 catalyst.

4.5 Photocatalytic Reactions and Determination
of Products
For a typical photocatalytic transformation of
alcohol, the experiment was conducted in acetonitrile (2 mL) containing
alcohol (0.02 mmol) in a Pyrex glass cylindrical bottle; Pt–TiO2 powder (10 mg) was suspended. The bottle was sealed with
a rubber cap and then irradiated by the 300 W Xe lamp under argon
atmosphere with magnetic stirring at room temperature. After the reaction,
the gas phase products including H2 and CO2 were
analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) using commercial standard gas
for retention time comparison (Agilent, GC-7890A, TCD detector equipped
with MS-5A column). After the suspension had been filtered to remove
the particles, the amounts of remaining alcohol and aldehyde and small-molecule
acid product(s) were determined by GC (Agilent, GC-7890A, FID detector,
equipped with DB-5 capillary column, 30 m × 250 mm × 0.1
mm) adding 0.02 mmol bromobenzene as internal standard. Oven temperature:
starting from 333 K for 2 min, then heating at 5 K/min to 483 K, and
remain for 20 min. Injector temperature: 573 K, detector temperature
553 K, and argon as carrier gas at a flowing rate of 1 mL/min. The
amounts of some nonvolatile high-boiling-point alcohols and aldehydes
were determined by HPLC. The analysis was conducted by a Shimadzu
HPLC system (LC-20AT pump and UV–vis SPD-20A detector) with
a Dikma Diamond C-18 (2) column (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm film
thickness), the mobile phase was 20% water in methanol at 1 mL/min,
and the detector wavelength was set to 254 nm. For Boc-prolinol and Boc-prolinal, the mobile phase was
30% water in methanol, and the detector wavelength was set to 220
nm. Quantification was performed using a calibration curve with a
standard for each substrate. For ethanol dehydrogenation, the amounts
of substrates and aldehyde products were determined after filtration
of TiO2 photocatalyst particles by 1H NMR (Bruker
400 MHz) using CD3CN (99% D) as solvent and benzene as
internal standard.

4.6 SS CP MAS 13C NMR Experiments
SS MAS 13C NMR experiments
to observe the adsorption
of substrate on our Pt–TiO2 photocatalyst surface
were conducted similar to the procedure of ref (48). Different TiO2 powders adsorbing ethanol or n-octanol were prepared
in a closed system connected with a vacuum line. The TiO2 or Pt–TiO2 sample (0.5 g) was spread on the bottom
of the 10 mL Pyrex glass bottle and was photoirradiated by the 300
W Xe lamp, which emitted both UV and visible light, from outside of
the bottom for 1 h in the presence of air at room temperature, followed
by evacuation at 473 K for 2 h to clean up the surface. After cooling
down to room temperature, the vapor of the adsorbate was introduced
to the bottle to be adsorbed by TiO2, and the system was
kept at room temperature for 6 h to establish the adsorption equilibrium.
The 13C CP MAS NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 400
MHz NMR spectrometer. The prepared sample was transferred into a zirconia
rotor (4 mm in diameter), and the rotor was sealed at room temperature
under argon condition in a glovebox. The rotation frequency of the
zirconia rotor was 12 kHz. The π/2 pulse width, the 1H–13C contact time, and the recycle delay were
4.5 μs, 2.0 ms, and 4.0 s, respectively. The accumulated number
was 2000 times. The chemical shift was calibrated by the signal of
adamantine C2 (37.85 ppm). In the present study, each reproducibility
error of the obtained signal was less than 0.1 ppm through all of
the measurements.

4.7 ATR–FTIR Measurements
The
ATR–FTIR spectroscopy experimental setup was similar to that
described in ref (19). The instrumental setup consisted of a self-modified ARK flow cell
(Thermo Fisher) containing a ZnSe crystal on the bottom plate and
a quartz window on the top plate. Twelve infrared bounces were allowed
using a 45° internal reflection element (80 × 10 ×
4 mm3). The FTIR measurements were performed on a Nicolet
6700 FT-IR spectrometer with an MCT detector. IR spectra ranging from
4000 to 650 cm–1 were recorded by averaging 64 scans
with a resolution of 4 cm–1. A layer of CH3CN solvent was dripped onto the surface of the ZnSe crystal that
was coated with a TiO2 or Pt–TiO2 film.
The crystal was then scanned to obtain the background spectrum. The
substrate-containing CH3CN solution was then dripped onto
the surface, and adsorption equilibrium on the TiO2 film
was achieved after a waiting period of 3 h.

TiO2 film
preparation: P25 or different wt % Pt–P25 was added in distilled
water at a concentration of 0.25 g/mL. This suspension was placed
in a 40 kHz ultrasonic bath for 20 min and then placed in an agate
mortar for 10 min. The suspension (1.5 mL) was spread on the ZnSe
crystal and dried for 1 h at 200 °C to remove H2O.

4.8 EPR Experiments
Low-temperature (8
K) EPR measurement was employed to observe hole consumption signals
of Pt–P25 samples under irradiation by octanol and ethanol
in the presence and absence of an acetonitrile solvent, respectively.
Before the measurement, Pt–P25 sample suspending in organic
substrates or solvents was collected and filled into a special cavity
in the argon glovebox and sealed. The obtained sample was then cooled
to 8 K by liquid helium. The settings for the EPR spectrometer were
as follows: center field, 3400 G; sweep width, 400/800 G; microwave
frequency, 9.52 GHz; and field modulation frequency, 100 kHz.
