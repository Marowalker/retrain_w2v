Hydroxyl
amino acids have tremendous potential applications in
food and pharmaceutical industries. However, available dioxygenases
are limited for selective and efficient hydroxylation of free amino
acids. Here, we identified a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase
from Kutzneria albida by gene mining
and characterized the encoded protein (KaPH1). KaPH1 was estimated to have a molecular weight of 29 kDa.
The optimal pH and temperature for its l-proline hydroxylation
activity were 6.5 and 30 °C, respectively. The Km and kcat values of KaPH1 were 1.07 mM and 0.54 s–1, respectively,
for this reaction by which 120 mM l-proline was converted
to trans-4-hydroxy-l-proline with 92.8%
yield (3.93 g·L–1·h–1). EDTA, [1,10-phenanthroline], Cu2+, Zn2+,
Co2+, and Ni2+ inhibited this reaction. KaPH1 was also active toward l-isoleucine for 4-hydroxyisoleucine
synthesis. Additionally, the unique biophysical features of KaPH1 were predicted by molecular modeling whereby this
study also contributes to our understanding of the catalytic mechanisms
of 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases.

Introduction
Hydroxyl amino acids
are used as nutritional supplements in the
food industry and as intermediates in the pharmaceutical industry.
For example, trans-4-hydroxy-l-proline (trans-4-Hyp) is a major component of collagen and used as
a nutritional supplement in animal diets in lieu of collagen.1trans-4-Hyp has also been reported
as a precursor for synthesis of pharmaceuticals and other important
compounds, such as (−)-kainic acid,2N-aryl pyrrole,3 and
the alkaloid TAN1251A.4 Given that trans-4-Hyp has such a versatile use with high demand, efficient
manufacturing methods that are environmental friendly are greatly
needed. Similar situations, albeit less drastic, exist also for other
hydroxyl amino acids. Compared with conventional methods involving
tissue extraction and chemical synthesis,5 biosynthesis has increasingly shown unique advantages of high specificity,
low energy consumption, and low environmental pollution. For example,
a 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG)-dependent dioxygenase can be used to synthesize trans-4-Hyp via l-proline hydroxylation simply
with 2-OG, Fe(II), and dioxygen in the reaction (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Hydroxylation Reaction
Catalyzed by KaPH1
2-OG-dependent dioxygenases for l-proline hydroxylation
have been discovered in various microorganisms, such as Dactylosporangium sp. RH1,6Streptomyces
griseoviridus P8648,7 and Clonostachys cylindrospora SANK 14591.8 Among them, a 2-OG-dependent dioxygenase from Dactylosporangium sp. (P4H), which catalyzes trans-4-Hyp production, has previously been cloned into Escherichia coli (E. coli).6 This P4H-expressing recombinant E. coli strain (W1485/pWFH1) was then cultured for
100 h in a jar fermenter, yielding 41 g·L–1trans-4-Hyp.9 Although
various 2-OG-dependent dioxygenases have been identified for biocatalytic
conversion of l-proline to trans-4-Hyp,
efficient enzymes with high selectivity are still limited, necessitating
development or identification of a new dioxygenase.

The members
of the 2-OG-dependent dioxygenase superfamily, such
as clavaminic acid synthase10 and arginine
hydroxylase,11 have similar reaction mechanisms
due to characteristic amino acid residues. Thus, here we sought to
identify a new 2-OG-dependent dioxygenase for l-proline hydroxylation
by gene mining. We thereby identified a new Fe(II)- and 2-OG-dependent
dioxygenase KaPH1, which showed high l-proline
hydroxylating activity. KaPH1 was then cloned into
an E. coli BL21(DE3) strain, expressed,
and purified. The purified protein was used to characterize the catalytic
activity of KaPH1 for l-proline hydroxylation.
Additionally, the unique biophysical features of KaPH1 were predicted by molecular modeling whereby this study also
contributes to our understanding of the catalytic mechanisms of 2-oxoglutarate-dependent
dioxygenases.

Results and Discussion
Gene Mining-Based Identification
of Functional Dioxygenases
Hydroxylation of nonaromatic amino
acids catalyzed by Fe(II)- and
2-OG-dependent dioxygenases, such as clavaminic acid synthase CAS12 and l-arginine dioxygenase VioC,13 occurs through a similar reaction mechanism.
These two enzymes exhibit approximately 32% amino acid sequence identity.
Thus, gene mining was performed based on sequence similarity. Toward
this end, the amino acid sequence of P4H (GenBank: BAA20094.1) from Dactylosporangium sp. was used as the template whereby three
putative functional proteins from Kutzneria albida (K. albida) were identified. Among these, KaPH1 (GenBank: WP_025358137.1) exhibited 51% amino acid
sequence identity to P4H, KaPH2 (GenBank: WP_030110684.1)
exhibited 45% amino acid sequence identity to P4H, and KaPH3 (GenBank: WP_025355730.1) exhibited 42% amino acid sequence identity
to P4H (Figure 1).

are indicated with dotted lines. Conserved amino acid residues are
indicated in the blue box in which the same amino acid residues are
shown with red background. Fe(II)- and 2-OG-binding residues are marked
with triangles and circles, respectively. Predicted binding sites
for l-proline and 2-OG are marked with rhombi and pentagons,
respectively. Secondary structures are indicated for P4H as spirals
(helices) and arrows. The multiple sequence alignment was generated
by the ESPript program.

Fe(II)/2-OG-dependent dioxygenases have a β-strand
“jellyroll”
structural fold that contains three metal-binding residues in a His-X-Asp/Glu-Xn-His
motif.14 Furthermore, 2-OG chelates Fe(II)
with its C-2 keto group and C-1 carboxylate functions as the cofactor,
while its C-5 carboxylate mediates an additional interaction with
other side chains.15 In consistency with
this, His109, Asp111, and His215 of P4H are involved in metal binding.
Additionally, an Arg residue residing at the active site of P4H (Arg226)
is involved in 2-OG C-5 stabilization. Notably, the “His-X-Asp”
carboxylate motif and Arg residue of the active site are conserved
in KaPH1, KaPH2, and KaPH3. The structural similarity between the active site of P4H and
that of KaPH1, KaPH2, and KaPH3 suggested that the three proteins may catalyze l-proline hydroxylation.

The corresponding genes encoding KaPH1, KaPH2, KaPH3, and
P4H were cloned and expressed
in recombinant E. coli. The recombinants
were cultured in autoinduction media at 20 °C. As shown in Figure 2a, all the enzymes
were heterologously expressed in soluble forms. Additionally, they
all showed distinct bands in SDS-PAGE in agreement with the predicted
molecular weights (P4H, 29.71 kDa; KaPH1, 29.02 kDa; KaPH2, 29.48 kDa; KaPH3, 30.1 kDa).

the growth phase of the recombinant strains. These recombinants were
cultivated in autoinduction media containing 20 mM l-proline
as the substrate. The trans-4-Hyp content of the
fermentation supernatant was measured under standard conditions.

The catalytic activities of the
recombinant proteins for l-proline hydroxylation were further
evaluated with 20 mM l-proline as the substrate. The products
were isolated and subjected
to structural analysis as described above. The spectra of 1H NMR (Figure S1), 13C NMR
(Figure S2), and MS (Figure S4a) are shown in the Supporting Information. As shown
in Figure 2b, 2223
mg·L–1 of trans-4-Hyp was
produced in the growth phase of the recombinant strain KaPH1, with a yield of 84.8%, while 2022 mg·L–1trans-4-Hyp was achieved in the growth phase by
P4H with a yield of 77.1%. The yields obtained from recombinant strains KaPH2 and KaPH3 were 64.8% (1723 mg·L–1) and 54.7% (1455 mg·L–1),
respectively. No significant difference was observed in the OD600 values of the recombinants, suggesting that growth of the
recombinants is normal. The results indicated that the recombinant E. coli strain KaPH1 derived from
gene mining showed a relatively high l-proline hydroxylating
activity compared with P4H. Therefore, KaPH1 was
further processed by affinity purification.

Kinetic Parameters of KaPH1
The Michaelis–Menten
kinetic parameters of KaPH1 and P4H were measured
by varying l-proline and 2-OG concentrations. Comparisons
of the kinetic parameters are shown in Table 1. The kcat value
of KaPH1 for l-proline was 1.47 times higher
than that of P4H, while the Km value of KaPH1 was slightly higher than that of P4H. The kcat value of KaPH1 for 2-OG
was higher than that of P4H with a lower Km value. Although P4H had a higher affinity for l-proline
than KaPH1, the reaction rate of KaPH1 was 1.47 times higher than that of P4H with a higher affinity
and higher reaction rate for 2-OG. The kcat/Km values of KaPH1
for both substrates were higher than those of P4H, indicating that KaPH1 would be favorable for l-proline hydroxylation
that involves 2-OG decarboxylation.

To elucidate the biophysical differences between P4H and KaPH1, homology modeling, and molecular docking analyses
were performed. The leucine dioxygenase GriE (PDB: 5NCI) as the highest
scoring template was submitted for the prediction of potential binding
sites of KaPH1 and P4H. It exhibits 41.34 and 41.9%
identity to KaPH1 and P4H, respectively. The structural
alignment was performed as shown in Figure 3a. The active center of KaPH1 (purple) almost coincides with that of P4H (green). Notably,
the residues (Glu150-Asp183) of P4H form a rigid α-helix near
the HXD/E···H Fe(II)-binding motif, while the residues
(Leu150-Leu183) of KaPH1 form flexible loops. Both
components are probably important in the conversion of l-proline,
causing the difference in the catalytic performance between P4H and KaPH1. Additionally, the crystal structures of GriE showed
conformational changes in the loop regions of which the loop comprising
residues 159–176 was assumed to be a lid for the active site.16

docking results of 2-OG and substrate l-proline in (b) KaPH1 and (c) P4H. The distances between C4 of l-proline/C1 of 2-OG and Fe(II) are illustrated by yellow dashed lines.

Furthermore, Fe(II), 2-OG, and l-proline were docked into
the active center of KaPH1 and P4H using AutoDock.
The distance between l-proline and Fe(II) as well as 2-OG
were calculated and illustrated in Figure 3b,c. The Fe(II) is bound with three residues
(His109, Asp111, and His211/215) in the docking models, while 2-OG
binds to the Fe(II) with the C-1 carboxylate and C-2 ketone, and its
C-5 carboxylate interacts with another residue (Arg222/226) for additional
structural stabilization. The side chains of three residues (His109,
Asp111, and His211/215), Gln92, and Trp115 are neatly arranged near
Fe(II). Among them, Gln92 and Trp115 may interact with the proline
carboxylate, properly positioning proline with the C4 bond for oxidation
with respect to Fe(II).15 Next, the side
chains of three residues (Asn96, Ser 213/217, and Arg222/226) may
help the carbonyl group of 2-OG to position toward the Fe(II). Conformation
of the active site that contains Fe(II) and l-proline converts
to a Fe(IV)-peroxyhemiketal transition state as dioxygen binds to
the vacant coordination site and interacts with the carbonyl group
of 2-OG.16 Afterward, 2-OG is decarboxylated
followed by hydroxylation of l-proline.17 Notably, the distance between C4 of l-proline
and Fe(II) is 3.8 Å in the active center of KaPH1, while it is 5.7 Å with P4H. The distance between C1 of
2-OG and Fe(II) in the active center of KaPH1 (2.5
Å) is shorter than that with P4H (2.6 Å). The proximity
may lead to a higher catalytic efficiency in KaPH1
toward the substrate/cofactor. Molecular modeling analysis suggested
that the structures of KaPH1 and P4H are similar,
especially in the conserved motif. The structural differences in flexibility
and interaction with metals and substrates are expected to influence
the catalytic activities of the enzymes.

Effects of Temperature
and pH on KaPH1 Activity
2-OG-dependent
dioxygenases specific for l-proline hydroxylation
from various microbial strains exhibit an optimum temperature range
of 30–40 °C and pH range of 6.0–7.5.18 The effects of temperature and pH on the catalytic
activity of recombinant KaPH1 were investigated.
The relative activity of recombinant KaPH1 was maintained
above 60% at a temperature range of 20–35 °C and reached
the maximum activity at 30 °C (Figure 4a). According to the pH profile (Figure 4b), KaPH1 showed the highest activity around pH 6.5 in the MES buffer (0.05
M) with an abrupt increase at pH 6.0, and it was stable under slightly
acidic conditions.

Figure 4 Effects of temperature and pH on the activity of KaPH1. (a) Optimum temperature of l-proline hydroxylation
by KaPH1. (b) Optimum pH of l-proline hydroxylation
by KaPH1. The following buffers were used: MES–Tris
buffer (0.05 M), pH 4–7.0; Tris–HCl buffer (0.05 M),
pH 7.0–9.0. The maximum KaPH1 enzymatic activity
was set to 100%.

Effects of Common Cofactors
and Inhibitors on the Enzymatic
Activity
The effects of several common enzymatic cofactors
and inhibitors on the enzyme activity were investigated in the activity
assay system. As shown in Table 2, the requirement of 2-OG appeared to be very strict,
and no trans-4-Hyp was detected without 2-OG. This
phenomenon has also been found in other 2-OG-dependent dioxygenases
with 2-OG as the decarboxylation cosubstrate.19

a Effects of chemicals and metal ions
were assayed under standard assay conditions. Relative activity was
calculated as percentages to the enzymatic activity under the following
conditions: l-proline (Pro, 10 mM), 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG,
10 mM), ferrous sulfate (Fe(II), 1.5 mM), l-ascorbic acid
(VC, 10 mM).

The 2-OG-dependent
dioxygenases are likely to have the relevant
structural feature where the Asp and two His residues are conserved.20 As a selective His-modifying reagent,21 the effect of diethyl pyrocarbonate on the enzymatic
activity of KaPH1 was investigated. Complete inhibition
of the enzymatic activity of KaPH1 was detected with
4 mM diethyl pyrocarbonate, suggesting that the His residues are critical
for KaPH1’s enzymatic activity. l-ascorbate was reported to be involved in biochemical reactions catalyzed
by dioxygenases that require Fe(II) and 2-OG as cofactors,22 and thus, as expected, l-ascorbate
promoted KaPH1 activity. Furthermore, EDTA and 1,10-phenanthroline
as the chelating agents strongly inhibited the enzymatic activity,
suggesting the requirement for Fe(II). l-proline hydroxylating
activity of KaPH1 without FeSO4 in the
reaction mixture is presumably due to KaPH1’s
interaction with the Fe(II) pool of the E. coli cells before the purification, as reported previously.23

Inhibition of 2-OG dioxygenases by divalent
transition metal ions
has been extensively observed. Mn2+, Ni2+, Co2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+ were generally found
to be the most potent inhibitors.24 The
enzymatic activity of KaPH1 declined in the presence
of divalent transition metal ions (Table 2), and the strongest inhibition was caused
by Zn2+, Ni2+, Co2+, and Cu2+. Inhibition is mostly attributed to competition with Fe(II) for
binding to the active site, although such competition was observed
at nonactive sites in some cases as well.25

Enzymatic Activity toward l-Isoleucine
Besides trans-4-Hyp, 4-HIL is another major hydroxyl amino acid
constituent of important pharmaceuticals.26,27 It can be synthesized via l-isoleucine hydroxylation by
2-OG-dependent dioxygenases.28l-Isoleucine is an aliphatic amino acid and thus differs from l-proline, which has a heterocyclic structure. Therefore, l-isoleucine hydroxylation activity of KaPH1
was also evaluated under standard conditions. The reaction mixture
was subjected to HPLC analysis as described above. As shown in Figure 5, KaPH1 was active toward l-isoleucine. The products were characterized
by 1H NMR spectroscopy (Figure S3) and MS (Figure S4b). These results indicate
that KaPH1 can hydroxylate different amino acids
whereby the most useful intermediates for food and pharmaceutical
industries are produced.

Figure 5 l-Isoleucine hydroxylation by KaPH1. trans-4-Hyp was detected by LC–MS
analysis after
the incubation of KaPH1 with l-proline (l-Pro) as the substrate. 4-HIL was detected by LC–MS
analysis after the incubation of KaPH1 with l-isoleucine (L-Ile) as the substrate. Relative activities are presented
with the assumption that the activity on l-Pro is 100%. 4-HIL
was further characterized by MS and 1H NMR as described
in the ESI.

l-Proline Hydroxylation
by KaPH1
Hydroxylation of l-proline,
with the concentration of
10–120 mM, was catalyzed by 1 g·L–1 purified KaPH1 in 10–210 min. As shown in Figure 6, KaPH1 showed
a robust catalytic activity for l-proline hydroxylation,
completely converting 10 mM l-proline within 10 min. Substrate
inhibition was not evident during the hydroxylation reaction under
any substrate concentration. In addition, KaPH1 generated
92.8% trans-4-Hyp yield with 120 mM l-proline
after 4 h (3.93 g·L–1·h–1). P4H-containing recombinant E. coli W1485/pWFH1 yielded 41 g·L–1 of trans-4-Hyp after 100 h of culturing.9 Bontoux
et al.100 evaluated five strains of Clonostachys cylindrospora that produce trans-4-Hyp. Among these, SANK 14591 generated trans-4-Hyp
with a yield of 13.8 mg·L–1.8 By comparison, KaPH1 would be a highly
efficient biocatalyst for in vitro enzymatic generation of trans-4-Hyp.

Figure 6 l-Proline hydroxylation catalyzed by the recombinant KaPH1. Samples were taken every 10 min, and the content
of trans-4-Hyp was measured under standard conditions.

Conclusions
In
this paper, three putative dioxygenases from K. albida were identified by gene mining against
P4H. By evaluating the l-proline hydroxylation capacity of
the putative enzymes, a new Fe(II)- and 2-OG-dependent dioxygenase KaPH1 from K. albida was
identified and characterized for its efficiency in converting free l-proline to trans-4-Hyp. Furthermore, the
findings demonstrated the high biotransformation efficiency of KaPH1 (a 92.8% yield when 120 mM l-proline was
used as the substrate) as well as its l-isoleucine hydroxylation
activity. In conclusion, the newly identified enzyme KaPH1 is a promising biocatalyst for in vitro generation of trans-4-Hyp and other hydroxyl amino acids.

Candidate Gene
Screening and Sequence Analysis
To identify
potential dioxygenases for l-proline hydroxylation, we searched
the National Center for Biotechnology Information database (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) using the amino acid sequence of P4H as the query in the protein
BLAST algorithm (GenBank accession number: BAA20094.1).29 Multiple sequence alignments with secondary

Bacterial Culture and Recombinant
Gene Expression
Recombinant E. coli BL21(DE3) strains were grown at 37 °C
in LB liquid medium containing 50 μg·mL–1 kanamycin. Cells were inoculated into 30 mL of autoinduction media
(tryptone, 10 g·L–1; yeast extract, 5 g·L–1; glycerol, 5 g·L–1; glucose,
0.5 g·L–1; α-lactose, 10 g·L–1; Na2HPO4, 7.1 g·L–1; KH2PO4, 6.8 g·L–1; NH4Cl, 2.68 g·L–1; Na2SO4, 0.71 g·L–1; MgSO4·7H2O, 0.74 g·L–1; CaCl2, 0.015 g·L–1; pH 7.0).31 Cultures were grown in baffled Erlenmeyer flasks
on rotary shakers. Cell densities were monitored by measuring the
optical density at 600 nm (OD600) using a A380 scanning
UV–vis spectrophotometer (AOE Instruments Company, Shanghai,
China). Recombinant protein production was analyzed by sodium dodecyl
sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).32 Digital images of the gels were captured on
a Gel Doc 2000 instrument (Bio-Rad, Shanghai, China).

Identification
of Functional Dioxygenases Catalyzing l-Proline Hydroxylation
The recombinant strains were inoculated
into the whole cell conversion system where glucose (20 mM), l-proline (20 mM), l-ascorbic acid (5 mM), 2-OG (20 mM),
FeSO4·7H2O (0.5 mM), MgSO4 (2
mM), and CaCl2 (0.5 mM) were added into 30 mL of autoinduction
media. The recombinant strains were first cultured at 37 °C,
200 rpm for 3 h, and then incubated at 20 °C, 250 rpm for 96
h for whole cell conversion. Samples were taken every 12 h. They were
boiled for 10 min, centrifuged at 18,514 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was analyzed by high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC)33 whereby trans-4-Hyp was detected.

Protein Purification
The crude enzymes were obtained
after disruption of the bacterial pellet and centrifugation, and the
supernatant was purified using a HisTrap HP affinity column (GE Healthcare,
U.S.A.).34 Then, the purified fractions
were applied to disposable PD-10 desalting columns (GE Healthcare,
U.S.A.) to remove the high salt content derived from the elution buffer
of the affinity columns.35 The protein
yields were evaluated by a NanoDrop 8000 microvolume UV–vis
spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, U.S.A.).

Enzymatic Activity Assays
The concentrations of the
purified enzymes were determined by Thermo Scientific NanoDrop 8000
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, U.S.A.). Meanwhile, a mix of 10 mM l-Pro, 1.5 mM FeSO4, 10 mM l-ascorbic acid,
10 mM 2-OG, and 150 mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic
acid (MES) buffer (pH 6.5) was incubated in a Thermomixer Comfort
incubator (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) at 30 °C, 500 rpm. The
reaction was started by adding 1 g·L–1 purified
enzyme in a final volume of 500 μL.36 Samples were taken 0, 5, and 10 min after adding the enzyme and
analyzed by HPLC.33 One unit of enzymatic
activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to catalyze
the synthesis of 1 μmol trans-4-Hyp/min under
standard conditions.

Determination of Kinetic Parameters
The kinetic parameters
(Km and Vmax) were determined in the assay mixture in a final volume of 300 μL.
For l-proline, the standard assay conditions were used, with
the concentration of l-proline ranging between 0.1 and 5
mM. Likewise, the concentration of 2-OG, where applicable, varied
between 0.1 and 5 mM. The assays were carried out in triplicate. KaPH1 activity was measured as described above, and the
kinetic parameters were fitted into a Michaelis–Menten model.37

Effects of pH and Temperature on KaPH1 Activity
To determine the effect of pH, we
measured KaPH1
activity at a pH range of 4.0–9.0 with the standard reaction
mixture. The effect of temperature on KaPH1 activity
was determined with the standard reaction mixture incubated for 10
min at different temperatures ranging from 10 to 45 °C.

Effects
of Common Enzymatic Cofactors and Inhibitors on KaPH1 Activity
The effects of commonly found enzymatic
cofactors (l-ascorbic acid, 2-OG, Mn2+, Mg2+, Co2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, and
Ni2+), a divalent cation chelator (EDTA), a metal chelator
(1,10-phenanthroline), and a nuclease inhibitor (diethyl pyrocarbonate)
on KaPH1 activity were investigated in the enzymatic
activity assay system. KaPH1 activity was measured
as described above.

l-Proline Hydroxylation by KaPH1
l-proline hydroxylation by the recombinant KaPH1 was investigated under different substrate concentrations.
The
reaction mixture contained 1.5 mM FeSO4, 10 mM l-ascorbic acid, 10–120 mM l-proline, 10–120
mM 2-OG, 1 g·L–1 purified enzyme, and 150 mM
MES buffer (pH 6.5) in a final volume of 500 μL. This mixture
was incubated in a Thermomixer Comfort incubator (Eppendorf, Hamburg,
Germany) at 30 °C, 500 rpm. Notably, l-proline and 2-OG
were used at the same concentration.

Analytical Methods
The analyses of amino acids were
carried out by the post column derivatization method with Fmoc-Cl.33 The samples containing hydroxyproline were analyzed
by using the Waters 2695 HPLC system equipped with a Diomansil C18
column (250 mm long with 4.6 mm in inner diameter). The chromatographic
conditions were as follows: mobile phase A [NaAc–HAc buffer
(50 mM, pH 4.2):acetonitrile, 70:30] and mobile phase B [NaAc–HAc
buffer (50 mM, pH 4.2):acetonitrile, 30:70] were used with a gradient
elution program at a flow rate of 1 mL·min–1, and the column temperature was kept at 25 °C. The injection
volume was 10 μL. Fmoc-Cl derivatives of amino acids and hydroxyl
amino acids formed in the reaction mixture were detected spectrofluorometrically
at 263 nm.

LC–MS analysis was carried out using a Waters
ACQUITY UPLC–MS system with a Waters ACQUITY UPLC HSS C18 reversed
phase column (inner diameter: 1.8 μm). The inlet, MS transfer
line, and ion source temperatures were set at 280, 280, and 230 °C,
respectively.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Analysis
The products
derived from l-proline hydroxylation by purified enzyme KaPH1 were isolated from the reaction mixtures by the methods
reported previously.38 After the cation
exchange chromatography using a strong cation resin (C100E (Na+ form), Purolite, England), the fractions with NH4OH were concentrated under vacuum. The reactions generated 2.13 mM trans-4-Hyp with 69% isolated yield. The concentrated product
was dissolved in D2O, and then 1H NMR (400 MHz)
and 13C NMR (100 MHz) analyses of the trans-4-Hyp were recorded using an Avance 400 (Bruker, Billerica, MA,
U.S.A.). The chemical shifts were provided in parts per million, and
coupling constants were reported in Hertz (Hz). Multiplicity was indicated
as follows: s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), q (quartet), m
(multiplet), dd (doublet of doublet), and br (broad). 1H NMR of trans-4-Hyp: 4.60 (s, 1H), 4.28 (d, J = 2.0 Hz, 1H), 3.40 (d, J = 3.7 Hz, 1H),
3.34–3.21 (m, 1H), 2.35 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 1H),
2.09 (s, 1H). 13C NMR of trans-4-Hyp:
174.23 (s), 70.07 (s), 59.88 (s), 52.97 (s), 37.44 (s). The spectrum
of the prepared trans-4-Hyp is consistent with that
reported in the literature.39

4-Hydroxyisoleucine
(4-HIL) was generated in vitro by KaPH1-mediated
hydroxylation of l-isoleucine. The reactions generated 0.97
mM 4-HIL with 47% isolated yield. The spectrum of 4-HIL was recorded
on an Avance 400 (Bruker, Billerica, MA, U.S.A.) at 400 MHz (1H NMR) as described before.281H NMR of 4-HIL: δ 3.84 (d, J = 4.4
Hz, 1H), 3.79 (dd, J = 13.6, 6.8 Hz, 1H), 1.92–1.82
(m, 1H), 1.19 (d, J = 6.3 Hz, 3H), 0.91 (d, J = 7.1 Hz, 3H).

Homology Modeling and Molecular Docking
Homology structures
of KaPH1 and P4H were constructed with Phyre 240 (PDB: 5NCI) as a template. All docking calculations
of 2-OG and substrate l-proline were achieved with AutoDock
4.2.41 Rigid receptor–flexible ligand
docking was carried out with the standard parameters for interactive
growing and subsequent scoring.
