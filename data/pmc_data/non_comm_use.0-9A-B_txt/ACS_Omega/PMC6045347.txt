Silk
protein fibroins have gained remarkable attention in recent
years as a potential drug carrier in the developing medicinal field
of research. In this work, the stability of anticancer agent curcumin
in the presence of two different silk protein fibroins from nonmulberry Antheraea mylitta (Am) and mulberry Bombyx mori (Bm) has been examined, and the possible
mechanism of stabilization in a physiologically relevant medium has
also been explored. In solution phase, upon treatment with curcumin,
the predominated β-sheet structure of Am is marginally altered,
whereas in the case of Bm, a substantial structural changeover has
been observed (from coil to β-sheet) to accommodate the hydrophobic
drug. Also, the morphological assessments suggest that curcumin is
nicely housed in the nanoscaffold of silk fibroin (SF). Consequently,
the extent of degradation of curcumin is remarkably suppressed upon
encapsulation with the SF. The dissimilarity in the binding patterns
of curcumin with these silk proteins could be responsible for the
observed difference in the stability orders. Curcumin binds the surface
of Bm, whereas in Am, the drug is incorporated in the hydrophobic
cavity, and as a consequence, the drug is effectively sequestered
out of the aqueous medium. The increase in the fluorescence quantum
yield upon interaction with the protein greatly modulates the excited-state
intermolecular hydrogen atom transfer (ESIPT) process, which is in
tune with a substantial increase in the lifetime of the excited-state
of curcumin. The ESIPT is known to play a crucial role in the degradation
of curcumin under physiological pH conditions, which perhaps implies
its potential therapeutic activity in the presence of silk. The in-depth
spectroscopic analyses of curcumin–SF complexes in aqueous
medium can provide useful insights for further applicative developments
in bioengineering.

1 Introduction
In
the past few decades, material-based drug-delivery systems have
been in the forefront of biomedical research.1,2 Various
biocompatible materials are under investigation to advance the therapeutic
activity of drugs to achieve more effective and safer therapeutics
for clinical applications.2,3 Among the various biocompatible
materials reported for the fabrication of drug-delivery carriers,
the silk fibroin (SF)-based biomaterials have gained remarkable interest
nowadays.4 The uniqueness of the material
can be with respect to its properties such as biocompatibility, self-assembling,
mechanical properties (utilized in drug- and gene-delivery), solubility
(in various solvents), and biodegradability,4 and this can be achieved by tweaking its secondary structure. Such
a wide variation in the properties makes the silk protein a potent
drug-delivery vehicle. Researchers are trying to improve such systems
by controlling the size and structure of silk proteins fabricated
into diverse morphologies.4 Recently, some
researchers have suggested that silk-based microneedle devices show
impressive medical applications such that the material can be used
in transdermal drug-delivery.5,6

Silkworms are
broadly classified, domesticated and grown, depending
upon their food sources. There are two groups called mulberry (Bombyx mori; Bm) and nonmulberry (Antheraea mylitta; Am). The domesticated mulberry
silkworms are commercially available throughout the world, and the
nonmulberry silkworms are wild and grown commercially in tropical
parts of India.7,8 This type of silk contains two
varieties of proteins, namely fibrous fibroin and globular sericin.7,9 Mulberry silk is commonly known for its superior tensile strength
of fibroin, and the fiber formation depends upon the β-sheet
content of the silk. Actually, folding of the β-sheet reforms
it into a highly ordered crystalline structure, which makes the material
a potential candidate for biomedical utilizations.4,10 On
the other hand, the presence of some specific hydrophobic residues
in nonmulberry silk caters a better mechanical property over mulberry.7 In fact, nonmulberry fibroin is naturally gifted
with integrin-binding RGD sequences, which can bind surface active
molecules and shows substantial advantages as a biomaterial.7 Utilization of nanocarriers of various morphological
forms of SF [three-dimensional scaffolds, hydrogel, and two-dimensional
(2D) films] as in vitro drug-delivery systems is also very much promising.4,11−13

In recent years, rapid development and screening
of new active
pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are considered a remarkable improvements
in science and medicine, but unfortunately, most of the drugs are
poorly soluble in water and cannot reach their site of action.14 A third-generation cancer chemopreventive agent,
curcumin, also shows such poor aqueous solubility like other APIs.3 Curcumin is a secondary metabolite found in the
plant Curcuma longa and is one of the
most active components of the Indian spice turmeric.15−17 It is the best-known diarylheptanoid consisting of two aromatic
rings (aryl group) joined by the C7 chain with various substituents.
In solution, curcumin exists in an equilibrium between keto- and enol-tautomers
(Scheme 1), and this
equilibrium plays an important role in its physicochemical properties
and antioxidant activities.18,19 It has been found that
curcumin has good anti-inflammatory19,20 and antioxidant
properties.19 Recently, curcumin has been
found to bind α-amyloid proteins that are responsible for Alzheimer’s
disease.15,19,21 It can also
be considered as a model drug for the treatment of HIV infection,22 anticystic fibrosis,23 wound-healing process, and heavy-metal toxicity in neurons.24Actually, a lower proportion of cancer patients
and world’s lowest age-correlated Alzheimer’s disease
incidences are found in India, and this could be due to the usage
of curcumin that has superior beneficial properties.15,25 Several studies have been conducted, and the anticancer activity
of curcumin was established just a decade ago.19,25,26

Scheme 1 Structure of Curcumin in the Keto–Enol
Forms
Curcumin is a potential choice
in the development of drugs and
therapeutic agents against several diseases for its broad field of
applications.17,19 Importantly, there are two major
challenges which limit their targets. These are low solubility of
curcumin in aqueous medium and its rapid degradation in physiological
pH, especially under reducing conditions. In the basic pH condition,
the free hydroxide is responsible for the degradation of curcumin.
It is also rapidly degraded in the presence of light.19,25 Presence of a hydrophobic skeleton and intermolecular H-bond make
curcumin very feebly soluble in aqueous medium, and that is only ∼0.4
μg/mL at room temperature.27 Such
a solubility is not sufficient in the biological systems for its desired
activity, and moreover, this is further lowered by its rapid degradation.
Hence, the development of new curcumin carriers has been a challenge
in the past decade. A few methods have been developed to take care
of its solubility and stability issues. For example, sodium dodecyl
sulphate (SDS),28,29 cetyl trimethylammonium bromide,28,30 Triton X-100,29 reverse micelles,31 Niosomes,32 bile
salt aggregates,33 and various other systems34−36 have been found to increase the solubility and stability of curcumin.
Curcumin delivery by encapsulation in polymer nanoparticles,37−39 some metallo–curcumin complex,40 and a hydrogel41 have also been found
to be very promising. Recently, the use of plasma and other proteins
in stabilizing curcumin has also been reported,42,43 but these proteins are not efficient for a prolonged time toward
curcumin stabilization. In fact, the hydrophobic interior and hydrophilic
exterior are essential in stabilizing the dispersed curcumin. Here,
the hydrophobic region shields curcumin from hydrolysis, and the outer
hydrophilic layer stabilizes the system to remain soluble in the aqueous
phase.37 Therefore, large proteins with
more hydrophobic domains appear to be suitable carrier systems for
curcumin and also serve the purpose of stabilization. In this prospect,
β-sheet rich SF should be an appropriate choice to study the
concerned issues, and more importantly, silk-based natural polymeric
fibroins are strategically more useful than synthetic polymeric materials
because of some of its intrinsic properties and processing requirements.11 In recent years, these silk-based materials
have been developed as nanoparticles to deliver proteins, small molecules,
and anticancer drugs.11 Actually, nanoparticle
delivery systems are expected to improve the efficiency of various
encapsulated therapeutics over the microlevel particles. Recently,
some reports have been published on the modified SF media, which show
controlled delivery and excellent release of curcumin from the silk
scaffold moiety.44,45 Also, the mechanisms of stabilization
were elucidated into three types of Bm silk films: as-cast, dried
from hydrogels, and methanol-treated.3 Hence,
it is well-established that the transformation of Bm to nanoparticles
or hydrogels can lead to a good curcumin stabilizer for controlled
release applications. Therefore in this respect, it is also important
to look at the specialty of the native form of Bm and the new variety
Am to assess how efficient these materials are to stabilize curcumin
in solution for improved delivery applications.

In this work,
we investigate the solubility and stability of curcumin,
mediated by silk protein fibroins, using various optical spectroscopy
and morphological studies. In general, two different routes have been
proposed for the therapeutic function of curcumin. One is its unique
photodynamic nature in vitro where curcumin generates singlet oxygen
in the excited-state. For this reason, the phototoxic characteristic
of the excited-state of curcumin toward selected bacteria is possibly
responsible for its versatile drug activity.46 The encapsulator-mediated stabilization and controlled release in
vivo is another important aspect. Earlier photophysical reports suggest
that the intramolecular hydrogen-bond-assisted intramolecular hydrogen-atom
(or proton)-transfer (ESIHT or ESIPT) process plays a crucial role
in drug stabilization. On the other hand, in vitro curcumin-based
photodynamic therapy (PDT) investigations are also very encouraging,
and recently some reports are also suggesting the high specificity
of curcumin-mediated PDT.35,46,47 Till date, the mechanism of phototoxicity is not clearly understood,
and it is believed that ESIPT imparts a critical role in singlet oxygen
generation and PDT.46 Therefore, an understanding
of the complex behavior of ESIPT provides insight into the model for
the in vivo delivery from membrane interface to endothelial cell walls
and in vitro film-based PDT.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Structural and Morphological Details of Silk
Protein in the Presence of Curcumin
2.1.1 Effect
on the Fibroin Secondary Structure
Circular dichroism (CD)
spectra provide detailed information about
the secondary structural changes of protein during the binding process.48Figure 1a,b depicts the CD spectra of the tropical nonmulberry silk
protein fibroin (Am) and mulberry silk protein fibroin (Bm) with increasing
concentration of curcumin. In the native form of Bm, the CD spectra
show one peak around 200 nm, which generally corresponds to the coil
structure, but with increasing concentration of curcumin, the peak
around 200 nm disappears and a new peak appears around 218 nm, which
is the suggestive peak for the β-sheet structure. The coil to
β-sheet structural transformation in Bm is quite common in a
hydrophobic medium such as ethanol, and the same phenomenon can also
be observed by lowering of pH (from pH 7 to 5 or even lower), because
this effectively induces a coil to β-sheet transformation in
SF, which is nothing but conversion of a distorted conformation (i.e.,
random coil or silk I) into a more stable sheet conformation (i.e.,
silk II).49,50 In fact, in the presence of a hydrophobic
ligand, a major conformational change is accomplished to form a stable,
compact hydrophobic unit.51 Herein, curcumin
assists in the folding of Bm, which takes place by the zipping of
the backbone of the peptide chain.51 This
transformation is quite important for its biomedical applications
because many researchers have shown that the ability of the drug to
be released from SF materials is governed largely by their secondary
structure, especially the β-sheet content.10 In the case of Am, the β-sheet is regarded as the
native form, and with increasing concentration of curcumin, this form
stays with little change in the sheet structure.

CD spectra of (a) Am (0.3 mg mL–1) and (b) Bm (0.3
mg mL–1) as a function of concentration
of curcumin (from 0 to 50 μM) at pH 7.4.

2.1.2 Variation in the Fibroin Particle Size
We performed dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements to understand
the size distribution of SF in the presence of curcumin (Figure 2). Figure 2b indicates that under physiological
pH conditions, the DLS spectrum of Bm shows four distinct peaks from
the lower to upper size ranges (∼10 nm to 1 μm). However,
data shows that the average size distribution of Bm is around 60 nm,
which indicates that the fibroin structure is composed of a high proportion
of smaller particles or low-molecular-weight species. Upon addition
of curcumin, the size distribution window is shifted to the higher
side with reduction of peak numbers, and the average size distributions
are 114 and 116 nm due to the addition of 10 and 20 μM curcumin,
respectively. These results indicate that in the presence of curcumin,
the structure of Bm is modified from a more distributed form to a
somewhat ordered structure.49 He et al.
found the same type of structural changeover in the case of Bm, and
they proposed that this is a characteristic structural conversion
from the coil to β-sheet form.49 This
nicely corroborates the previous results from CD study also. On the
other hand, in the case of Am, the single monodispersed peak on the
higher side of the size distribution window (Figure 2a) corresponds to the ordered structure (β-form),
and with the addition of curcumin, it transforms into a form with
size distribution little bit in the higher side, indicating no further
alteration of the protein structure as the β-sheet is composed
of larger-sized particles. In the case of drug-delivery, the particle
size is an important factor, and the useful range of particle sizes
employed for medical purposes is ≤100 nm,52 although the larger-sized particles can absorb and carry
the drug with high propensity as their surface to mass ratio is on
the higher side.52

distribution of SFs with concentration of
curcumin: (a) silk protein fibroin Am (0.4 mg mL–1) and (b) Bm (0.4 mg mL–1).

2.1.3 Morphological Assessment
Field
emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) study is employed to
examine the morphology of SF. Figure 3a,b highlights the 2D FE-SEM image of Bm in the absence
and presence of curcumin, respectively. Pure Bm shows the branched
structure, and a closer look indicates that such a structure is formed
via aggregation of various small nanoentities. A recent report suggested
that Bm consists of polydispersed particles, and under the diffusion
limited aggregation (DLA) model, a dynamic interplay between the aggregation
of small and large particles is likely to be observed to form a dense
architecture, whereby larger particles act as new nucleation sites
for smaller particles.8 In the presence
of curcumin, the branched aggregation of Bm loses the compactness
in the architecture. The DLS data indicate that with increasing curcumin
concentration, the size of Bm aggregates slightly alters its polydisperse
property by converting the smaller particles into larger ones. This
may be the reason behind the different morphologies of Bm in the presence
of curcumin. On the other hand, the FE-SEM image of Am shows a netlike
structure with certain hollow spaces (Figure S1, Supporting Information). In fact, the monodisperse particles
of Am are aggregated to form a snowflake-like architecture via the
regular and preferential growth, followed by some modification in
the classical DLA model.8 In this case,
at higher particle concentrations, this type of array may be set up
together to form a netlike structure (highly interconnected porous
structures).53 After addition of curcumin,
no change in the morphology of Am is observed, and this supports the
previous results. A detailed scrutiny of the morphology could provide
the location and encapsulation states of curcumin in these materials.
The porous structure of Am permits curcumin to adhere within the scaffold
and provides the maximum area around the encapsulated drug. Whereas
in case of Bm, curcumin can manage to attach to the surface or at
the interfacial position of the dense architecture of Bm.

of Bm (1 mg mL–1) in the (a) absence
and (b) presence of curcumin (50 μM).

2.2 Silk Media Assists Curcumin Solubilization
The solubility of curcumin can be followed by steady-state ultraviolet–visible
(UV–vis) absorption as a function of the concentration of Am
and Bm (Figure 4a,b).
Curcumin has very low solubility in aqueous neutral phosphate buffer
solution, but with increasing protein concentration, solubilization
of curcumin is substantially facilitated. In aqueous buffers, the
absorption spectra of curcumin exhibit a characteristic broad peak
at 430 nm and a small shoulder at 355 nm, which are assigned to the
lowest (π–π*) transition of the conjugated curcumin
and feruloyl unit, respectively.34 With
the addition of Bm, the absorbance of curcumin increases without affecting
the spectral pattern. On the other hand, with increasing concentration
of Am, the broad peak around 430 nm becomes prominent with a slight
blue shift (by ∼4 nm), and the shoulder peak at 355 nm disappears
with the appearance of a new shoulder at 450 nm. These indicate that
curcumin partitions from the aqueous phase into the nonpolar-like
environment, very similar to that in chloroform. The spectrum displays
vibronic structures with absorbance maxima near 420 nm, and this corresponds
to the highly conjugated protonated enol.34,35 The absence of the 450 nm shoulder structure and the quite-aqueous-like
spectral pattern of curcumin in the presence of Bm suggests that this
drug molecule has adsorbed on the surface of the protein where aqueous
phase is in close proximity.

of (a) silk Am and (b) silk Bm.

2.3 Excited-State Properties of Curcumin and Delineation
of the Binding Location
To interpret the binding interaction
between curcumin and SF, we monitored the change in the fluorescence
of curcumin with the addition of silk protein (highlighted in Figure 5a,b). Under physiological
pH conditions, the quantum yield of curcumin is very low, and it can
be regarded as almost nonfluorescent. However, the addition of the
silk protein to the buffered curcumin leads to a substantial enhancement
with a blue shift in the emission profile, and it reaches saturation
above certain concentration. This indicates that the fibroin protein
facilitates solubilization through partitioning of curcumin molecule
from the bulk aqueous to proteinous medium. The quantum yield (Φ)
of curcumin is also found to vary with the protein concentration and
reaches a limiting value (Figure 5c). The observed limiting quantum yield is 0.062 and
0.020 for Am and Bm, respectively. Interestingly, the increase in
the quantum efficiency of curcumin in two different fibroin media
is quite different, which is possibly because of the differences in
the location of binding. The fluorescence quantum yield of curcumin
is predominantly controlled by the perturbation in the ESIPT process.32 ESIPT is considered to be the primary factor
responsible for the reduction in the fluorescence efficiency of curcumin,
and any perturbation on this imparts a larger influence on the enhancement
of fluorescence intensity via blocking of the nonradiative decay processes,
and this will be discussed later on. Therefore, with the addition
of SF, the ESIPT of the drug is largely affected because of the change
in the surrounding environment of the molecule. The comparatively
low Φ in Bm suggests that the ESIPT process is still in operation,
whereas in the presence of Am, a large modulation of the ESIPT process
results in higher Φ. Therefore, this result indicates that the
curcumin molecule is attached to the more solvent (aqueous) assessable
part of Bm.

of concentration of (a) SF Am and (b) SF Bm. (c) Variation of the
quantum yield (Φ) of curcumin with concentration of Am or Bm
(inset). Symbols with vertical cap indicate the error bar.

We employed steady-state anisotropy (r0) measurements and micropolarity analysis of the bound
drug to find
out the location of curcumin in the protein medium. The value of anisotropy
at the saturation point is maximum in the case of Am than that in
Bm (0.323 and 0.318 for Am and Bm) (Figure S2, Supporting Information), which clearly indicates that the
drug molecule is tightly incorporated in the rigid environment of
Am than in Bm. In line with the previous analysis, a substantial rigidity
in the microenvironment of the Bm–curcumin complex arises because
of the stronger surface occupation of the drug, which is presumably
due to the interfacial adsorption. In the micropolarity analysis,
at a maximum concentration of SF, the ET(30) values are around 43.52 and 45.29 for Am and Bm, respectively
[from ET(30) scale presented in Table
S1, Supporting Information]. These values
suggest that the probe is located in a more hydrophobic region in
Am compared to that in Bm environment. Because both the fibroins are
rich in the β-sheet structure, this little difference in micropolarity
after binding with curcumin indicates that drug is positioned slightly
away from the hydrophobic core of Bm, which perhaps signifies the
surface attachment, as also evident from the previous results.

2.4 Interpretation of the Binding Interactions
and Thermodynamics Details
So far, we have found that the
fibroin protein can serve as an excellent protector of curcumin from
the external aqueous environment. Actually, the nature of interaction
between the drug and fibroin can assess on how efficient these proteins
can be as carrier of curcumin. To find out the binding stoichiometry
of curcumin with SF, we employed the Job’s plot analysis (Figure
S3, Supporting Information) using the fluorescence
technique.54 The results suggest that the
fibroin protein forms 1:1 stoichiometric complex with curcumin (n = 1 for Am and n = 1.2 for Bm). Since
the binding stoichiometry is found to be close to unity, we have determined
the binding constant for curcumin−fibroin complexation by employing
the Benesi–Hildebrand (B–H) equation.55 The estimated binding constant (KBH) of curcumin with Am and Bm are (3.87 ± 0.15) ×
105 and (1.65 ± 0.06) × 106 M–1, respectively, at pH 7.4 at 298 K. The value of KBH was obtained from the slope of (I∞ – I0)/(It – I0) versus
[protein]−1 plot, (B–H plot) (Figure S4, Supporting Information and Table 1). The results indicate that the values are
on the order of 105 to 106, which infer quite
a strong complexation. The binding efficiency of curcumin is much
higher with Bm than with Am. This can be explained by the binding-induced
structural transition of Bm from the random coil to a more ordered
β-sheet structure. This further indicates that the curcumin-mediated
structural transition of Bm results in a greater binding strength.
As hydrophobic interactions are the dominant driving forces for the
β-sheet folding in aqueous medium, curcumin possibly reinforces
the hydrophobic interaction between the two peptide chains of Bm.56 In the protein segment, various other forces
are still in operation, and among them, H-bonding is always an integral
part of the interaction.

The possibility of hydrogen bond formation with curcumin is strongly
dependent on the ionic strength of the medium.57,58 Actually, salt is regarded as a good substance for breaking and
making of H-bonds, thereby promoting the formation of intermolecular
H-bonding of curcumin, and resulting in the modulation of the ESIPT
rate.58 Here, with the addition of salt
(NaCl) in the curcumin–fibroin complex, the fluorescence intensity
is found to be enhanced with a considerable blue shift of the emission
maxima (Figure 6a,b).
However, no noticeable change in the absorption spectra was found,
which means the addition of salt affects the excited-state predominantly,
thereby modulating the ESIPT rate. We could not monitor the ESIPT
at the higher salinity range because of the instability of SF. As
the salt concentration increases, the fibroins are finally spun into
water-insoluble fibers by mechanical shear and the stretching action
of the spinneret.49,50 The addition of salt also enhances
the interaction of curcumin with protein segments to perturb the H-bonding
with the fluorophore and effectively reduces the ESIPT-mediated nonradiative
processes.

van’t Hoff plot for the binding of curcumin with SFs in pH
7.4.

Electrostatic interaction, hydrophobic
force, van der Waals force,
and H-bonding interaction are the major forces operating in chemical
and biological systems.48 Ross and Subramanian
presented a thumb rule to explicate the nature of the binding interaction,
depending on the signs and magnitudes of thermodynamic parameters
(ΔH0 and ΔS0).59 At first, we varied the
temperature at some fixed composition of Am–curcumin (Figure 6c), and we observed
that with increasing temperature, the fluorescence intensity decreases.
This means that at elevated temperatures, the equilibrium between
the bound and unbound forms of curcumin with the silk protein gets
disturbed, and some fraction of curcumin is thrown out from the proteinous
medium to bulk aqueous phase, perhaps indicating the weaker association
of the complex. We also used the van’t Hoff equation (eq 1) to estimate the thermodynamic
parameters of binding.48 1  KBH is the binding
constant at temperature T and R is
the gas constant. The values of ΔH0 and ΔS0 were obtained from the
linear van’t Hoff plot. The value of ΔG0 is evaluated using the following equation 2  

We have estimated the magnitude of
the standard binding enthalpy
change (from slope) and standard binding entropy change (from intercept)
from the ln KBH versus 1/T plot (Figure 6d),
and the corresponding data are highlighted in Table 1. Magnitudes of ΔG0 for curcumin–SF complexes, estimated by using eq 2 at different temperatures,
are shown in Table 1 also. The negative value of the standard Gibbs free energy change
(ΔG0) indicates the spontaneous
nature of the interaction between the fibroin protein and curcumin.
The ΔG0 [(−31.87 ± 0.18)
and (−35.47 ± 0.12) kJ/mol for Am and Bm, respectively,
at 298 K)] values are mostly guided by the negative values of ΔH0 [(−11.57 ± 0.09) and (−7.15
± 0.18) kJ/mol for Am and Bm, respectively] and positive values
of ΔS0 [(68.51 ± 0.10) and
(95.02 ± 0.21) J/K mol for Am and Bm, respectively). Hence, the
thermodynamics of the binding of curcumin with SF is strongly assisted
by the exothermicity as well as positive entropy. A very low buffer
solubility and a substantially higher solubilization of curcumin in
silk protein signify that the hydrophobic force of interaction could
be the major binding force in the association process. According to
Ross et al.,59 the sign of ΔH0 and ΔS0 would
be positive for the hydrophobic effect. In low temperatures, the positive
ΔS0 (hydrophobic effect) is the
main contributor for the spontaneous association. However, we have
estimated negative and positive values for ΔH0 and ΔS0, respectively.
Therefore, the force responsible for a large negative contribution
of ΔH0 compensates the hydrophobic
force (positive ΔH0) effectively,
and these would be the van der Waals force, hydrogen-bonding, and
ionic interaction (relatively less contribution). Therefore, from
the estimated magnitude and sign of the thermodynamic parameters (Table 1), we can conclude
that the hydrophobic interaction is predominant in the case of Bm–curcumin
association, whereas the other forces are largely operative in the
Am–curcumin association.

2.5 Stability
of Curcumin in Silk Fibroins: Comparison
with Other Media
In aqueous medium, the solubility of curcumin
is substantially altered with change in pH of the medium from acidic
to alkaline. However, in alkaline or neutral pH, curcumin undergoes
rapid degradation, and it is due to the instability of the β-diketone
linker, which rapidly dissociates to vanillin, ferulic acid, and feruloyl
methane.60 In aqueous buffer (pH 7.4) solution,
almost half the proportion of curcumin was degraded in around 30 min
of interval.37,61 In the previous section, we found
that in the presence of these SFs, the solubility of curcumin was
greatly enhanced. Therefore, an estimation of the extent degradation
is required to assess the stability. The degradation rates of curcumin
in the presence of Am or Bm were investigated using the UV–vis
absorbance method, and the changes are highlighted in Figure 7. In the pseudo-zero-order
kinetics, the observed degradation rates of curcumin are around 3.3
× 10–3 and 1.7 × 10–2% min–1 in the presence of Am and Bm, respectively.
This indicates that curcumin is well-fibroinized to get better stability
than the other reported protein-containing environment, for example,
human serum albumin (0.20% min–1), fibrinogen (0.22%
min–1), transferrin (1.80 and 0.18% min–1), and immunoglobulin G (2.92 and 0.58% min–1).42 Also cyclodextrins can provide quite a similar
kind of degradation rate.61 Previous reports
show that the stability of curcumin is greatly enhanced in micelle,
niosome, vesicle, and polymeric media.14,28,32,62,63 Some recent reports proposed that polymeric nanoparticles can also
be efficient to stabilize curcumin for a prolonged time.37,38 But in the case of synthesized carrier systems, toxicity is always
a matter of concern. Therefore, on the issues of biocompatibility
and biodegradability, the natural proteins should be preferable for
drug carrying and stability.2,64 As a comparison, the
stability of curcumin is found to be higher in Am than in Bm. Nowadays,
Bm is frequently used as a drug-delivery system, and a recent report
suggested that a fabricated Bm film is capable of stabilizing curcumin
at various temperatures for a prolonged time.3 Therefore, these results have indeed helped to identify a new drug-delivery
system Am for further medicinal purposes, and it could be potentially
viable for encapsulating curcumin and similar systems as a carrier
protein.

2.6 Role
of the Excited-State Processes from the
Perspective of Drug Stabilization
As mentioned earlier, the
unique phototoxic nature of curcumin comes from the excited-state
dynamic phenomena so that the long-lived excited-state species will
have substantial importance in the therapeutic activity.46 It has been found that in various organized
media, the excited-state lifetime of curcumin is considerably increased,
and it is considered that these media have the role of stabilizing
curcumin that is necessary for increased therapeutic activity. Therefore,
an understanding of the complex excited dynamics of curcumin in solution
and in organized media is very much crucial in fabricating or selecting
some effective carrier encapsulates. Excited-state photophysics of
curcumin primarily depends on the ESIPT and solvation processes.31,34 ESIPT is considered as one of the major factors for deactivation
of the excited-state through nonradiative processes, leading to shortening
of the fluorescence lifetimes.58 There
are some reports on the excited-state behavior of curcumin in neat
and mixed solvents. In nonpolar solvents, the proton transfer (PT)
process is primarily guided by formation of the intermolecular six-membered
hydrogen-bonded chelate ring of the cis-enol form. Such a PT is very
fast and completed within a few hundreds of femtoseconds.65 However, in polar protic solvents such as methanol,
the intramolecular H-bonding gets perturbed because of the influence
of the solvent molecule with the H bond of curcumin.66 Saini and Das investigated the excited-state dynamics of
curcumin in the presence of various mixed solvents, and they found
that variable properties, for example, viscosity, polarity, and hydrogen-bonding
ability, of the alcohol solvent have key roles in the excited-state
processes in the toluene–alcohol mixtures.67,68 Leung et al.37 showed by the fluorescence
upconversion technique that curcumin encapsulated in polyester nanoparticles
exhibit three types of decay processes, where the very fast one (∼2–4
ps) is assigned to the reorganization of water molecules, time constant
of ∼50 ps is responsible for the ESIPT of curcumin, and a slow
decay component 200–400 ps is also present. Adhikary et al.
reported that the ESIPT process is primarily observed in the micelle-encapsulated
curcumin molecule, where deuteration of curcumin has a negligible
effect on the fast component, and the second component (responsible
for ESIPT, τ ≈ 50 ps) exhibits a pronounced isotope effect.69 Recent reports demonstrated that in the presence
of various organized media, the ESIPT of curcumin is greatly modulated
with a decrease in the contribution of fast ESIPT processes to slow
decay processes followed by an increase in the fluorescence lifetime.32,69 The fluorescence decays of curcumin were measured in the presence
of SFs with an excitation wavelength of 442.6 nm, and the fluorescence
decays were monitored in the respective emission maxima. Figure 8 depicts the fluorescence
decay pattern of curcumin with increasing concentration of SF. The
lifetime values, obtained by fitting these decay plots with the biexponential
decay model, are tabulated in Table 2. In some reports, the fast component in the biexponential
lifetime has been considered responsible for ESIPT,32,33,38 although on the picosecond time scale, it
would be very hard to identify and explicate the exact processes.
Therefore, we estimated the average lifetime of curcumin by the following eq 4 for simpler explanations
because in a heterogeneous protein pocket, curcumin experiences different
type of interactions, resulting in a complex decay process. From Table 2, it is evident that
the average lifetime of curcumin sharply increases with increasing
SF concentration. At some optimum concentration of SFs (5 μM
for Am and 1 μM for Bm), the average lifetime value of curcumin
is found to be 0.450 and 0.416 ns for Am and Bm, respectively, with
individual components 0.334 ns (0.78%) and 0.861 ns (0.22%) for Am
and 0.334 ns (0.89%) and 1.075 ns (0.11%) for Bm. The average fluorescence
lifetime of curcumin in these systems is found to be very close to
those in octanol and in a composed vesicular system, that is, the
bilayer region of the small unilamellar niosomes.32,67 This indicates that microenvironments surrounding the drug molecules
are quite alike. The lifetime of curcumin in the presence of serum
protein is also well-modified (τav ≈ 217 ps),70 but in comparison with the silk protein, this
value is quite less. This means that the silk protein protects curcumin
very well and it also provides a better stability. The obtained average
lifetime value inside Bm is less compared to Am, which clearly indicates
that the modulation of the ESIPT process of curcumin occurs because
of the different drug–protein binding characteristic, primarily
related to the location of curcumin inside the protein cavity. Importantly,
because of the different structures of Am and Bm, the location of
attachment of the drug is naturally different, and the solvated protein
water can play some important roles to perturb the ESIPT process of
curcumin, leading to different lifetime values. In particular, the
strength of the intermolecular hydrogen-bonding between curcumin and
the surrounding molecules also affects the ESIPT. In this case, curcumin
is capable of forming hydrogen bonds with the peptide and disulfide
linkage, resembling the protic nature of the surrounding environment.
The substantial increase in the average lifetime (τav, for Am is 0.450 and that for Bm is 0.416) values indicates the
stability of curcumin, where the drug is located in the hydrophobic
region of the silk protein and segregated from the aqueous phase.
This possibly elicits the suppression in hydrolysis. The study of
the change in the lifetime of curcumin in different heterogeneous
media also helps us to estimate the radiative (kr) and nonradiative (knr) rate
constants using the following equation (eqs 3 and 4). 3   4

As
shown in Table 2, knr decreases with an increase in the
SF concentration, which means that the duct of deactivation has been
converted into the radiative decay channels. However, the decrease
in the knr values of curcumin is higher
in the Am medium than that in Bm, and the corresponding knr values of curcumin in Am (5 μM) and Bm (1 μM)
solutions are ∼2.08 × 109 and ∼2.36
× 109 s–1, respectively.

3 Conclusions
The morphology and binding (encapsulation)
details of two silk
protein fibroins named Am and Bm are investigated in the presence
of the so-called anticancer agent curcumin. Structural analyses suggest
that the increase in the concentration of curcumin causes a minimal
change in the β-sheet structure of Am, whereas the secondary
structure of Bm is largely altered from coil to β-sheet. These
properties are largely beneficial in drug stabilization. Also, the
FE-SEM studies characterize the morphologies of SF in the presence
or absence of curcumin and interpret the curcumin-mediated change
of the nanoaggregated structure of these proteins. In the presence
of these proteins, solubilization of curcumin is largely enhanced,
and also the rate of degradation at physiological pH is considerably
reduced. In a comparison, Am provides better stability of curcumin
than Bm, and this difference could be due to the location of the drug
molecule; as in the case of Am, the curcumin enters a more rigid and
hydrophobic core of the protein cavity and in the case of Bm, the
drug appears to be adsorbed on the surface of the protein and faces
a less hydrophobic environment. The surface binding of curcumin exhibits
greater binding affinities through modification of the peptide interactions.
Upon encapsulation in the fibroin proteins, the fluorescence intensity
and excited-state lifetime of curcumin are greatly increased through
hindering of the main deactivation process, for example, ESIPT. Also,
with an increase in the salinity in the drug–protein cocktail,
the ESIPT is found to be remarkably modulated, which perhaps implies
the involvement of H-bonding in the keto–enol moiety with the
silk protein. Eventually, this study paves an excellent route to stabilize
curcumin in solution (in physiological pH condition) and subsequent
drug activity. The natural biocompatible SF (Bm and especially Am)
can be employed as promising drug stabilizers for curcumin and other
related drugs for controlled drug-delivery.

4 Materials
and Methods
4.1 Materials
Curcumin (HiMedia, India)
was purified by the column chromatographic technique, and the purity
of the sample used was ∼99% (checked by high-performance liquid
chromatography). NaCl (analytical grade) was purchased from Merck,
India and ethanol (UV spectroscopic grade) was purchased from Spectrochem,
India. All other chemicals purchased were of analytical grade. Ultrapure
Milli Q water was used in the study. All solutions were prepared in
5 mM sodium phosphate buffer of pH 7.4 (±0.1). The pH value was
measured with a precalibrated Eutech pH 510 ion pH-meter.

4.2 Preparation of Silk Protein Fibroin Solution
Nonmulberry
tropical Tasar (A. mylitta, Am) 5th
instar silk larvae were collected from our biotechnology
farm, IIT Kharagpur, West Bengal, India. Fibroin was isolated following
the previously reported method.53 In brief,
silk glands were collected by sacrificing the larvae. The fibroin
was collected from the gland by squeezing and storing at 4 °C
for immediate use or at −20 °C until use. The fibroin
was dissolved in the aqueous buffer containing 1% (w/v) SDS, 10 mM
Tris (pH 8.0), and 5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. The solution
was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min, followed by the dialysis of
the supernatant against ultrapure water for 6–8 h in a 12 kDa
dialysis membrane (Sigma, USA). The fibroin was concentrated in a
3.5 kDa dialysis membrane (Thermo Fisher, USA) against 30% poly(ethylene
glycol) PEG 6000 solution.

The fibroin from mulberry B. mori (Bm) was isolated from cocoons following
the reported protocol.71 Briefly, cocoon
pieces were degummed in 0.02 M Na2CO3 solution
for 1 h and washed thoroughly with distilled water. The degummed fibroin
fibers were dissolved in 9.3 M aqueous LiBr solution and incubated
for 4 h at 60 °C. The solution was dialyzed [molecular weight
cutoff (MWCO) 12 kDa] against distilled water for 48–72 h.
The fibroin concentration was determined by measuring the residual
mass after drying at 37 °C.

4.3 Preparation
of Solution
A stock solution
of curcumin was prepared in methanol, and then methanol was evaporated.
To this, the required volume of pH 7.4 (±0.1) phosphate buffer
along with the required amount of fibroin solution was added to get
the final concentration of curcumin samples and the mixture was kept
for an hour at room temperature. The pH value of the prepared Bm SF
solution was in the range of 6.5–7.0, which is similar to the
reported value.72 The pH value of the Am
SF solution was in the range of 7.2–7.5. The fibroin solution
having pH in this range was used in sodium phosphate buffer of pH
7.4 (±0.1) for preparing the fibroin–curcumin mixed solution
throughout the experiment. All other reagents for this study were
dissolved in Milli-Q water.

4.4 Instrumentation and Methods
The UV–vis
absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2450 absorption
spectrophotometer by scanning the solution in the wavelength range
of 250–600 nm.

CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco-815
automatic recording spectropolarimeter at 298 K over a wavelength
range of 190–270 nm, with a scan speed 50 nm/min under constant
N2 purging. A quartz cell having a path length of 0.1 cm
was used, and three successive scans were accumulated for each spectrum.
The baseline was corrected by an appropriate buffer solution running
under the same conditions (blank) and subtracted from the experimental
spectra.

DLS measurements were attempted using a Malvern Nano
ZS instrument
(model no. ZEN3600) having a thermostated sample chamber. All measurements
were carried out using a 4 mW He–Ne laser (λ = 632 nm).

FE-SEM images were collected using a FEI NOVA NANOSEM 450 instrument
working at 5 KV. The film samples were spread on a glass slide and
coated with gold particles in a sputter coater.

The steady-state
fluorescence spectra were recorded at 298 K on
a Horiba Jobin Yvon spectrofluorimeter (Fluorolog-3) equipped with
a water-cooled temperature-controlled cuvette holder, and a quartz
cuvette of 1 cm path length was used. The samples were excited at
420 nm, and the emission wavelengths were recorded from 430 to 700
nm with different slit widths (2/1 nm for Am and 3/2 nm for Bm).

Steady-state anisotropy (r) measurements were
also carried out with the Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorimeter. The steady-state
anisotropy (r) is expressed as follows 5   6  where IVV and IVH are emission intensities collected
from the
sample when the excitation polarizer is oriented vertically and the
emission polarizer is placed vertically and horizontally, respectively. G is the correction factor for the instrument and is estimated
by keeping the excitation polarizer horizontal and emission polarizer
vertical and horizontal, respectively.

The fluorescence quantum
yield (Φ) was determined using C153
in acetonitrile (as a secondary standard probe with Φ = 0.56)34,73 and Φ of curcumin was estimated by the following equation 7  Here, ‘A’ terms
denote the area under the fluorescence curve; Abs denotes absorbance; n is the refractive index of the medium; Φ is the
fluorescence quantum yield; and subscripts S and R denote the parameters
for the studied sample and reference, respectively.

The fluorescence
lifetime was measured using a time-correlated
single photon counting spectrometer from Edinburgh Instrument Ltd.
(U.K.). The samples were excited at 442.6 (±10) nm using a picosecond
laser diode (EPL-445, pulse width ∼67.9 ps), and signals were
collected at a magic angle of 54.7° with a high-speed photomultiplier
tube (H10720-01, photosensor module from Hamamatsu, Japan). The fluorescence
decays were monitored at the corresponding emission maxima, as observed
in the steady-state fluorescence measurement. The instrument response
function of our setup is ∼230 ps. The data were analyzed using
FAST decay analysis software from Edinburgh Instruments. All fluorescence
decays were fitted with a biexponential function, considering a χ2 value close to 1, which is an indication of good fitting.

The average lifetimes of curcumin, after fitting the fluorescence
transients with a biexponential function, were estimated by using
the equation 8  where
τ1 and τ2 are the first and second
lifetime components, respectively,
which were monitored at the emission maxima of the fluorophore and a1 and a2 are the
respective amplitudes of these components.
