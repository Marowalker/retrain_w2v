The reactions of
β-aminoethanethiol with N,N-dimethyl enaminones are performed to selectively
provide disulfide-functionalized enaminones and 1,4-thiazines. By
performing the reaction in water and catalyst-free conditions, the
transamination and oxidative S–S coupling between the two substrates
take place to give disulfide-functionalized enaminones. On the other
hand, by using identical starting materials, the employment of the
CuI catalyst in dimethyl sulfoxide enables the selective generation
of 1,4-thiazines via tandem transamination and C(sp2)–H
bond thiolation.

Introduction
Enaminones are highly
useful building blocks in organic synthesis.
Owing to the versatile reactive sites of different functions in enaminones,
their application spans widely from diversity-oriented synthesis to
target-oriented synthesis.1 Although a
number of different reaction models employing enaminones as building
blocks have been already disclosed, a significant issue in further
expanding the synthetic application of enaminones is preparing enaminones
with unprecedented functional substructures. On the other hand, the
featured S–S bond in disulfide is well-documented as a useful
group with widespread utility in organic synthesis or bioactive molecules.2 Therefore, installing disulfide structure to enaminones can reasonably be useful
because disulfide-functionalized enaminones are potentially valuable
building blocks in the synthesis of diverse organic products.

1,4-Thiazine is a typical N,S-heterocyclic backbone with enriched
pharmacological profiles, such as vasopressin receptor antagonistic
activity,3 antimicrobial activity,4 calcium antagonistic activity,5 and so forth. Currently, 1,4-thiazines are known to be
synthetically accessible by several different synthetic methods, including
the reactions of tertiary diisopropylamines and sulfurothious dichloride,6 the tandem C–S cross-coupling and S-nucleophilic
substitution reactions,7 the ring-forming
reactions of electron-deficient alkynes and α-hydroxyimino-β-oxodithioesters,8 the microwave-assisted ring-opening reactions
of 2-aminobenzothiazoles with terminal alkynes,9 and the base-catalyzed cascade reactions between 1,4-dithiane-2,5-diol
and 1,2-diaza-1,3-dienes.10 Despite the
rich availability on the synthetic methods toward 1,4-thiazines, some
limits such as harsh reaction condition, tedious preparation of substrates,
and/or unsatisfactory application scope remain to be improved. In
this regard, developing new methods on 1,4-thiazine synthesis to complement
those known works is still highly desirable.

Recently, our and
other groups have disclosed that the direct C(sp2)–H
bond thiolation of enaminones is a highly useful
transformation in designing the synthesis of various sulfur-containing
products such as sulfenylated enaminones,11 sufur-bridged bisenaminones,12 sulfenylated
chromones,13 and sulfonylated chromones.14 Inspired by these results and our sustaining
efforts in developing new reactions based on the enaminone building
block, we report herein the reactions of enaminones and β-aminoethanethiol
for the tunable synthesis of disulfide-functionalized enaminones and
1,4-thiazines via tandem transformation of transamination,15 S–S bond formation, or the selective
C(sp2)–H bond thiolation.

Results and Discussion
Initially, the reaction of enaminone 1a and β-aminoethanethiol 2 was carried out in the presence of molecular iodine in ethyl
lactate (EL), and heating at 90 °C led to the formation of enamino
disulfide 3a with a moderate yield (entry 1, Table 1). Subsequently, reaction
conditions were briefly optimized on the same reaction. It was found
that equally good result could be obtained without using any catalyst
(entry 2, Table 1).
Moreover, the variation on the reaction medium indicated that water
was the best medium for this reaction. Furthermore, the entries conducted
at different temperatures proved that 70 °C was the most favorable
temperature (entries 6–8, Table 1).

To examine the application
scope of this catalyst-free protocol,
a broad array of N,N-dimethyl enaminones 1 were individually subjected with β-aminoethanethiol 2 in water. As outlined in Table 2, the enaminone substrate exhibited broad
tolerance to this transformation, and the products with various functional
groups such as alkyl, alkoxyl, halogen, perfluoroalkyl, naphthyl,
thiophenyl, and so forth in enaminone 1 participated
in the reaction smoothly. Most of these products were acquired with
excellent yields under the standard reaction conditions. No notable
effect of the substituent in the substrate 1 to the yield
of the products was observed. However, because of the limited availability
of a similar aminothiol substrate, the synthesis using different aminothiols
was not conducted.

To develop the synthetic application
of the enaminone and aminothiol
substrates in the tunable synthesis of more diverse compounds, we
assumed to accomplish the synthesis of 1,4-thiazines via the domino
transamination and enaminone C–H thiolation. To our delight,
after screening the catalytic conditions, the selective synthesis
of 1,4-thiazine 4a was realized by employing a copper
catalyst. As shown in Table 3, CuI displayed the best catalytic effect among the tested
copper salts (entries 1–4, Table 3). The dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), on the
other hand, was found to be much better medium than MeCN, toluene,
dioxane, 1,1-dichloroethane (DCE), water, and EL for the selective
formation of 4a (entries 5–11, Table 3). The variation on the reaction
temperature suggested that neither heightening nor lowering the temperature
was effective to improve the result (entries 12–13, Table 3). What is more, reducing
the loading of CuI to 0.1 equiv led to a sharp decrease on the yield
of 4a (entry 14, Table 3). In addition, the reaction conducted in the presence
of NiCl2 gave 4a with a low yield, and no
expected product was observed when FeCl3 was used as a
catalyst (entries 15–16, Table 3).

To illustrate the scope on the selective
synthesis of heterocyclic
products 4, a class of different enaminones 1 were subjected to react with β-aminoethanethiol 2 in the presence of CuI. As outlined in Scheme 1, the examination on the synthesis of different
1,4-thiazines 4 containing various substitutions, including
alkyl, alkoxyl, halogen, nitro, heteroaryl, and so forth, was smoothly
furnished by using corresponding enaminone substrates (4a–4i, Scheme 1), suggesting
the fine tolerance of the present catalytic reaction in the synthesis
of diverse 1,4-thiazines. The products were generally afforded with
moderate to good yield. The generally lower yield in the synthesis
of 4 than disulfides 3 was afforded because
of related enaminone disulfides was found as the minor byproducts
in these entries.

Scheme 1 Scope on the Selective Synthesis of 1,4-Thiazines
To explore the possible reaction
mechanisms for the generation
of products 4, several control experiments were conducted.
At first, the model reaction of enaminone 1a and 2 could give 4a with good yield even in the presence
of 5 equiv TEMPO, indicating that the ring formation reaction took
place via the ionic pathway (eq 1). On the other hand, directly subjecting disulfide 3a to the standard condition enabled the production of 4a with excellent yield (eq 2). This result implied that disulfide 3a might be an intermediate in the formation of the heterocyclic products.

 1   2  Under the inspiration
of the control experiment results, the plausible
mechanism for the reactions providing product 4 is proposed.
As shown in Scheme 2, the transamination between the dimethyl amino group in 1 and primary amine as well as the aerobic oxidative S–S coupling
of thiols is well-documented in the literature in which disulfide 3 is generated. Subsequently, the decomposition of 3 via the S–S bond cleavage affords Cu(I) species 5 and the iodothioite intermediate 6. The simultaneously
generated iodine anion may get oxidized to molecular iodine under
aerobic atmosphere. On the other hand, as the isomeric version of 5, intermediate 8 can readily be iodinated to
provide 9 which undergoes intramolecular nucleophilic
substitution to provide cyclic intermediate 10. The target
product 4 is finally produced via the tautomerization
of 10 (path a). However, considering the low yield in
forming disulfide 3a in the entry using DMSO and starting
materials 1a and 2 (entry 4, Table 1), it is also possible that
the reaction proceeds directly via the thiolated NH enaminone intermediate 7, which can also react with
CuI to provide intermediate 5. In addition, the subsequent
transformations as in path a then led to the product 4 (path b).

Scheme 2 Proposed Mechanism for the Reactions Providing 1,4-Thiazines
Conclusions
In
summary, we have developed the tunable reactions between N,N-dimethyl enaminones and β-aminoethanethiol
for the synthesis of enaminones containing the disulfide structure
and 3,4-dihydro-1,4-thiazines. The former ones are produced by means
of tandem transamination and oxidative S–S coupling by simply
heating in water without any catalyst, and the latter compounds, on
the other hand, were selectively afforded via transamination and C(sp2)–H bond thiolation by using CuI as the catalyst. The
results disclose new applications of enaminones in the synthesis of
diverse and useful organic products.

Experimental Section
General
All reactions were performed in an open air
atmosphere under magnetic stirring. N,N-Dimethyl enaminones 1 were synthesized by following
the literature procedure,16 and all other
chemicals and solvents were obtained from commercial sources, which
were used directly without further treatment. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded in a 400 MHz apparatus. The frequencies
for 1H NMR and 13C NMR test are 400 and 100
MHz, respectively. The chemical shifts were reported in ppm with tetramethylsilane
as an internal standard. Melting points were tested in a X-4A instrument
without correcting the temperature, and the high-resolution mass spectrometry
(HRMS) data for all new products were obtained under the ESI model.

General Procedure for the Synthesis of Disulfide Enaminones
To a 25 mL round-bottom flask were added enaminone 1 (0.4 mmol), β-aminoethanethiol 2 (0.4 mmol),
and H2O (2 mL). Then, the mixture was heated up to 70 °C
and stirred at the same temperature for 12 h under air atmosphere
[thin-layer chromatography (TLC)]. After cooling down to room temperature
(rt), the resulting mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The
organic phases were collected and washed three times with a small
amount of water. After drying with anhydrous Na2SO4, the solid was filtered and the solvent was removed under
reduced pressure. The resulting residue was subjected to flash silica
gel column chromatography to provide pure products with the elution
of mixed petroleum ether/ethyl acetate (v/v = 1:1).

General Procedure for the Synthesis of 1,4-Thiazines
To
a 25 mL round-bottom flask were added enaminones 1 (0.2
mmol), β-aminoethanethiol 2 (0.2 mmol),
CuI (0.06 mmol), and DMSO (2 mL). Then, the mixture was heated up
to 70 °C and stirred at the same temperature for 12 h under air
atmosphere (TLC). After cooling down to rt, 5 mL of water was added,
and the resulting mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic
phases were collected and washed three times with a small amount of
water. After drying with anhydrous Na2SO4, the
solid was filtered and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure.
The resulting residue was subjected to flash silica gel column chromatography
to provide pure products with the elution of mixed petroleum ether/ethyl
acetate (v/v = 1:1).
