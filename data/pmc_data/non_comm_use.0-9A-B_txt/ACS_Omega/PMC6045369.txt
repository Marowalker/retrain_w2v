The
forced-intercalation peptide nucleic acid (FIT-PNA) concept,
introduced by Seitz and co-workers, is based on replacing a nucleobase
of the PNA sequence with a cyanine dye (such as thiazole orange).
The cyanine dye is thus a surrogate base that is forced to intercalate
in the duplex (e.g., PNA:DNA). This allows single-mismatch sensitivity
as the introduction of a mismatch in the vicinity of the dye increases
freedom of motion and leads to a significant depletion of its fluorescence
because of the free rotation of the monomethine bond separating the
two π-systems of the cyanine dye. Herein, we designed and synthesized
six FIT-PNA probes, featuring bisquinoline (BisQ), a red-emitting
cyanine dye recently developed in our laboratory for FIT-PNAs. By
following PNA–DNA duplex fluorescence, we found new sequence-based
factors governing the fluorescence response to the mismatched FIT-PNA:DNA
duplex. Fluorogenic properties are correlated with the π-stacking
energy of three distinctive base pair steps (BPSs) in the PNA:DNA
duplex. The first two are the two BPSs opposite BisQ, whereas the
third is the BPS of the mismatch position, which presumably becomes
unstacked due to the mismatch. We suggest a predictive model for FIT-PNA
single-mismatch detection mechanism, a model that can be used in future
research to improve FIT-PNA design.

Introduction
FIT-PNA (forced intercalation
peptide nucleic acid) is a PNA (DNA-mimic)
molecule that acts as a light-up probe; its fluorescence increases
significantly after photoexcitation of FIT-PNA in the duplex form
(PNA:DNA and PNA:RNA).1

It is designed
by replacing one of the natural bases of PNA (typically
a purine) with a fluorescent probe (termed a “surrogate base”).
Upon hybridization, a mismatch in the vicinity of the surrogate base
is recorded as a decrease in fluorescence (in comparison to a fully
matched duplex) due to a less viscous environment surrounding the
surrogate base.2 This feature endows FIT-PNAs
with single-mismatch sensitivity, allowing the detection of single-nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP), even in living cells.3

SNP is a variation of a single nucleotide at a specific position
in a genome occurring within more than 1% of the population.4 This position may be in a coding, noncoding,
or intergenic region. As research advances, more and more diseases
and tendencies are linked to specific detectable SNPs. For example,
a higher tendency for opioid addiction,5 rheumatoid arthritis,6 and colorectal
cancer7 was found to be correlative with
specific SNPs.

Two main forces are at work in the Watson–Crick
double-stranded
helix model: hydrogen bond base pairing and nucleobase π-stacking.8 Whereas complementary oligonucleotide recognition
is ascribed to base pairing, the force enabling the thermal stability
of the duplex is considered to be the π-stacking interactions.9

Considering the entropy loss as a result
of duplex formation from
two highly flexible oligonucleotide single strands, a significant
enthalpy gain is needed to achieve successful duplex formation. The
enthalpy of the π-stacking interaction of the duplex is the
main source of this enthalpy gain,10 which
is evident by the fact that duplex thermal stability for a specific
sequence can be predicted as Tm (melting temperature) by accounting
solely its π-stacking interactions.9 The interaction of each two nucleobases (in a defined 5′
to 3′ direction) is termed the “nearest-neighbor interaction”,
or NNI, which has a particular value for ΔH.11

There are 10 possible NNI combinations,
all of which were calorimetrically
determined (Table 1). These values were found to be applicable to PNA:DNA duplexes as
well.12

PNA was first
introduced by Nielsen et al. in 1991.13 It is a DNA analogue which is hybridized to
a complementary oligonucleotide according to Watson–Crick base
pairing rules and thus exhibits true base pairing recognition abilities.14

This PNA structure mimics the 6 + 3 structure
of DNA, featuring
a six-atom backbone and a three-atom distance of nucleobase from the
backbone.14 A molecular dynamics illustration
of the PNA:DNA duplex exhibits the structural resemblance of the duplexed
conformation of the two oligonucleotides.15

The PNA:DNA duplex exhibits a higher thermal stability than
the
DNA:DNA duplex; this characteristic is ascribed to its uncharged backbone.14 PNA is also characterized by increased mismatch
selectivity; the effect of base pair mismatches on thermal stability
is greater for the PNA:DNA duplex than for the DNA:DNA duplex.14

A structural mechanism to explain PNA:DNA
hybrid favorable mismatch
selectivity was shown by Rathinavelan and Yathindra16 by employing molecular dynamics on matched and mismatched
DNA:PNA and DNA:DNA duplexes. They found that a mismatch at the PNA:DNA
double helix causes a loss of π-stacking interaction situated
5′ to 3′ from the mismatched base on the DNA strand.
This loss of π-stacking interaction does not occur at the same
sequence DNA:DNA duplex. The loss of π-stacking interaction
decreases the stability of the PNA:DNA mismatched duplex and is thus
thought to account for the remarkable mismatch recognition of PNA.17

The surrogate base in FIT-PNA is a cyanine
dye. The mechanism for
cyanine dye viscosity-dependent quantum yield was theoretically described
by Momicchioli and Baraldi.18 There are
two major competing processes once the cyanine dye is photoexcited
(Figure 1). One is
denoted by “f”, which is the emissive one, resulting
in fluorescence. The latter, defined as Nt [normal (planar) to twisted
(perpendicular)], is a rotation at the methine connecting the two
aromatic fragments. This process leads to a nonemissive route to the
ground state because of the unique charge-transfer properties of the
twisted excited state and, in turn, to a decrease in quantum yield.18 Environmental “viscosity” provides
an energy barrier for this “normal-to-twisted” rotation
(ENt in Figure 1), forcing the cyanine moiety to relax fluorescently.
In this regard, intercalation of a cyanine dye into the double-stranded
DNA π-stacking provides the viscosity needed for fluorescence
enhancement.19

mechanism. The bottom and top curves represent the energies of the
ground and first singlet excited states, respectively, as a function

We have designed and synthesized six FIT-PNA probes that
target
an SNP that is associated with drug resistance in malaria. In 2013,
researchers identified a molecular marker associated with the artemisinin-resistant
strains of Plasmodium falciparum (which
is the deadliest form of malaria): various SNP mutations in a gene
encoding for Kelch 13 (K13) propeller domain were shown to be related
with delayed parasite clearance in vitro and in vivo.20 We have focused on one of the most abundant SNPs in K13,
C580Y, and explored the fluorogenic response of these FIT-PNAs as
a function of mismatch type and position. This has led to a better
understanding on the thermodynamic parameters that dictate the fluorogenic
response and to a predictive model that could be applied to any given
FIT-PNA sequence.

Results and Discussion
We have designed
and synthesized six FIT-PNAs [Supporting Information, Figure S1—high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) chromatograms of purified FIT-PNAs] targeting
the K13 gene in P. falciparum (Table 2). In these FIT-PNAs,
we have added a stretch of eight d-lysines at the FIT-PNA
C-terminus. This was done as we have previously shown that this peptide
(octa-d-lysine) facilitates PNA uptake into P. falciparum-infected red blood cells in culture.3b Point mutations in this gene are associated
with acquired drug resistance of this parasite to the leading antimalarial
drug, artemisinin.20 We noticed, however,
that in the P. falciparum gene, the P. falciparum actin gene has a sequence very similar
to that of K13 with mismatches positioned several bases away from
the point mutation (SNP) (Table 2, mismatches highlighted in green). This has prompted
us to investigate whether mismatches that are not in the close vicinity
of the surrogate base influence the fluorescence of FIT-PNAs. Thus,
we have looked at other remote SNPs (other than actin mRNA) to delineate
the effect of such remote mismatches on FIT-PNA fluorescence. As shown
in Table 2, a red-emitting
surrogate base [bisquinoline (BisQ), Scheme 1], recently developed in our laboratory for
FIT-PNAs,3b was introduced at a position
that is next to the single point mutation in the K13 gene (marked
in red, C580Y). When BisQ is placed to the left of the SNP, toward
the 5′-end of the DNA, the FIT-PNA is given the “L”
annotation. When BisQ is to the right of the SNP, the FIT-PNA is defined
as “R”. Shifting the FIT-PNA three bases toward the
3′-end of the DNA is then defined as “+3”, whereas
shifting the FIT-PNA toward the 5′-end of the DNA is defined
as “–3”.

Initially, experiments and analyses
were conducted to determine
fluorogenic discrimination of K13-FIT PNA. FIT-PNAs were annealed
to 43-mer single-stranded DNAs with K13-C580 full complementary or
single mismatches [G:T, C:T, and T:T mismatches adjacent to BisQ sequences
B, C, and D (Supporting Information Table
S1) and A:C, T:C, and C:C mismatches adjacent to BisQ sequences H,
I, J, Q, R, and S (Supporting Information Table S1)]. Annealed FIT-PNA:C580Y DNA for all PNAs was used as
a control (If, where f = fully complementary).
Mismatch selectivity was assessed by comparing the normalized relative
fluorescence (I/If),
as shown in Table 3.

a All values are

matched duplex (I/If).
Lower case letters denote PNA nucleobases.

A few interesting observations are notable. The shift
of the FIT-PNA
to either 3′ or 5′ (±3) typically has a small effect
on mismatch discrimination (with the exception of the C:c mismatch
for −3L, Table 3). In addition, the T:t and T:c mismatches are poorly discriminated
for all L-type FIT-PNA probes. Other than the C:c mismatch (NNI =
5.6, Table S1), other mismatches are better
discriminated by the R series. Form these data, it would be advisable
to avoid SNP detection by FIT-PNAs in the case of a T:c or T:c mismatch
when BisQ is to the left of these mismatches (L series).

The
Seitz group1 and others3c suggested a mode of intercalation for FIT-PNAs,
where the “base pair” of the surrogate base is “flipped
out” to an extra-helical position and the exterior aromatic
ring takes its place as stacked between the two adjacent bases. A
mismatch adjacent to the surrogate base then loses this intercalation,
resulting in a less viscous environment (i.e., increased torsional
freedom of the monomethine bond, which results in lower fluorescence).
However, this model cannot readily explain the directional bias for
mismatch discrimination.

Instead, we suggest here a monomethine-restrictive
binding mode
which does not involve intercalation of the exterior heteroaromatic
ring of the cyanine dye into the base stacking column. In this binding
mode, the monomethine torsional rotation is restricted by the DNA
base π-stacking interaction. As a result, the rotation will
cause steric collision of the heteroaromatic ring, with the bases
forcing them to unstack. Therefore, the π-stacking of the DNA
bases is the force restricting the monomethine rotation, causing the
cyanine dye (BisQ) to fluoresce.

It has been shown that a mismatch
in a PNA:DNA duplex causes the
unstacking of the base step situated 5′ to 3′ from the
DNA mismatched base.16 In the current binding
model, an R-positioned mismatch will cause the unstacking of one of
the two base steps which create the BisQ external quinoline binding
groove—restricting its rotational freedom. In contrast, the
L-positioned mismatch will cause an unstacking of the base step further
away from the DNA base triad opposite BisQ, resulting in a higher
rotational freedom. This model can then explain this directional bias
(Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 L and R
Mismatch Discrimination
BisQ is marked in blue
B; the
mismatch is marked in red. The unstacked base pair steps (BPSs) due
to the mismatch are boxed. The DNA base triads opposite to BisQ are
underlined. When the mismatch is situated 5′ to BisQ (R), the
resulting unstacking occurs within the BisQ opposite to the DNA triad.
In contrast, in the L case, the unstacked BPS is outside of the BisQ
opposite to the DNA triad.

We next explored
the effect of shifting the mismatch position from
BisQ. It would be anticipated that once the mismatch is shifted away
from BisQ, then fluorescence gain would be immediate given the undisturbed
local duplex structure surrounding BisQ. To our surprise, we found
that this is not the case. Figures 2 and 3 present the relative
fluorescence (I/If) for
both R and L FIT-PNA series, respectively.

Figure 2 Effect of shifting the
mismatch from the adjacent sites (±1)
to BisQ for the R FIT-PNA series. The negative values in the x-axis correlate with shifting the mismatch to the 5′-direction
of BisQ, and positive values for a 3′ shift. The specific mismatches
are detailed in Supporting Information Table
S2.

Figure 3 Effect of shifting the mismatch from the adjacent
sites (±1)
to BisQ for the L FIT-PNA series. The negative values in the x-axis correlate with shifting the mismatch to the 5′-direction
of BisQ, and positive values for a 3′ shift. The specific mismatches
are detailed in Supporting Information Table
S2.

In the R FIT-PNA series, the gain
in fluorescence is not immediate
when moving the mismatch to the 5′-end (the minus direction).
In addition, there is a noticeable drop in fluorescence at position
+3 for two out of the three FIT-PNAs (0R and +3R). In the L FIT-PNA
series, there is a mirror image behavior toward the + direction where
the full gain in fluorescence is achieved only at position +4. A small
decrease in fluorescence is also noticeable in the minus direction
(−3 and −4).

It is clear from this study that
there are other factors governing
the overall BisQ fluorescence (in the duplex form) that are not solely
dependent on the mismatch position at the neighboring base to BisQ.
Interestingly, the behavior observed here for FIT-PNAs is slightly
different from that reported for FIT-DNA/LNA probes.21 A recent study with an FIT-DNA/LNA probe (QB-FIT)22 has shown a negligible effect of remote base
mismatches (in viral RNA) on QB-FIT fluorescence. These differences
may be related to the duplex form itself (DNA–RNA vs PNA–RNA)
or to the sequence itself.

If indeed the π-stacking interaction
of the base triad opposite
to BisQ is the force restraining the monomethine torsion, then as
the enthalpy of these interactions increases, the energy barrier for
monomethine torsion increases, resulting in greater fluorescence quenching.

Hence, the first sequence-based factor tested is the π-stacking
interaction enthalpy of the base triad opposite to BisQ. This value
is quantified as the sum of the π-stacking NNI of two steps11,12 (ΔH(NNI)) according to the mismatch positions
(−1 and +1). Because a mismatch at the −1 position causes
one of the two steps opposite to BisQ to unstack (Scheme 2), the NNI enthalpy of this
step was calculated as zero for such duplexes.

The next sequence-based
factor is ΔH(NNI)
of the π-stacking interaction for the base step situated 5′
to 3′ from the mismatch. Because this step becomes unstacked
because of the mismatch,16 this ΔH(NNI) is, in fact, the entropy difference between the matched
and mismatched duplexes.

Using a stochastic modeling approach,
we designed a predictive
model that is based on these two contributions: (1) the stacking energy
of the nucleobase triad situated opposite to BisQ—calculated
as the sum of the NNI enthalpy of two BPSs and, (2) the NNI enthalpy
of the BPS which becomes unstacked because of the mismatch, situated
5′ to 3′ from the DNA mismatched base. An example for
such a simple calculation is shown in the Supporting Information.

Figures 4 and 5 present the predictive
model based on these two
contributions for the R and L FIT-PNA series, respectively.

Figure 4 Correlation
of the NNI factor with I/If for the R FIT-PNA series.

Figure 5 Correlation of the NNI factor with I/If for the L FIT-PNA series.

The resulting prediction (Figures 4 and 5) shows a good
correlation
with the experimental data for both L and R FIT-PNA series. Clearly,
there are other factors that contribute to remote mismatches that
could not be solely attributed to ΔH(NNI).
Nonetheless, the NNI factor seems to provide a very reasonable fit
even to mismatches that are several bases away from BisQ.

To
test more robustly the correlation between I/If and its NNI enthalpy, we measured
the fluorescence of 114 different mismatched FIT-PNA·DNAs (each
duplex was measured thrice), varying the mismatched position and nucleobase
(see the Supporting Information for DNA
sequences).

The results are shown as a scatter plot (Figure 6) presenting 37 averaged I/If values (three PNAs with
the same
DNA measured three times; an average of nine data points for each I/If value on the graph) as
a function of the calculated NNI enthalpy change calculated for both
L and R series.

Figure 6 Scatter plot of average measured I/If values as a function of calculated NNI factor.
The full
data set used to generate this scatter plot is presented in Table
S3 (Supporting Information).

We observe a linear correlation of R2 = 0.61. The corresponding Pearson coefficient is 0.78,
which, for
a sample size of 37, is translated to a P value of
0.00001.

In conclusion, in this study, we have devised a simple
thermodynamic-based
model that allows predicting the mismatch discrimination of FIT-PNAs.
This should allow a simple means to design highly fluorogenic FIT-PNAs
with superior mismatch discrimination.

Experimental Methods
Materials
Fmoc-PNA monomers were purchased from PolyOrg,
Inc. (USA) and used as received. Fmoc-D-Lys-(Boc)-OH was purchased
from GL Biochem (Shanghai) ltd. Solvents and reagents for peptide
chemistry were purchased from Bio-lab (Israel). BisQ monomer was synthesized,
as reported earlier.3b

Solid-Phase
Synthesis of FIT-PNAs
FIT-PNAs were synthesized
in the solid phase based on literature procedures with some modifications
described as follows: the first amino acid Fmoc-D-Lys-(Boc)-OH was
coupled twice to the free hydroxyl groups of NovaSynTGA resin (Merck,
Germany) using 10 equiv of the amino acid, 5 equiv of diisopropylcarbodiimide,
and 0.1 equiv of 4-dimethylaminopyridine in dry dimethylformamide
(DMF). Fmoc deprotection was carried out by shaking resin with a 20%
piperidine solution in DMF for 10 min (×2), followed by washing
with DMF and dichloromethane. For a 10 μmol scale synthesis
on TGA-NovaSyn resin (loading −0.25 mmol/g), 2-(1H-7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyl uronium hexafluorophosphate
methanaminium (40 μmol), hydroxybenzotriazole (40 μmol),
diisopropylethylamine (80 μmol), and Fmoc-D-Lys-(Boc)-OH or
Fmoc-PNA monomers or BisQ monomer (40 μmol) were mixed in dry
DMF (0.4 mL) for 5 min and the solution was then added to the amine-functionalized
resin and mixed for 60 min. The FIT-PNAs were deprotected and released
from the resin by treatment with 90:10 (v/v) trifluoroacetyl (TFA)/m-cresol for 3 h. The PNAs were triturated with cold ethyl
ether, and the precipitate was collected. The PNA samples were analyzed
and purified on RP-HPLC (Shimadzu LC2010), using a semipreparative
C18 reverse-phase column (Phenomenex, Jupiter 300 A) at a flow rate
of 4 mL/min. Mobile phase: 0.1% TFA in H2O (A) and acetonitrile
(B) (see Supporting Information Figure
S1). The authenticity of each FIT-PNA was confirmed by matrix-assisted
laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Table 1).

FIT-PNA:DNA
Annealing and Fluorescence Measurements
Solutions of 1 μM
FIT-PNA and 2 μM complementary DNA
in phosphate buffered saline were prepared. These solutions were incubated
at 90 °C for 3 min and then allowed to gradually cool to room
temperature (RT). Duplex solutions were placed in a 96-well plate,
and fluorescence was recorded on a Cytation 3 plate reader at RT.
This procedure was repeated three times for each duplex (λexc = 550 nm\λem = 580–700 nm).
