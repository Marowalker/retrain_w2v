A novel
dioxa[6]helicene-based supramolecular chirogenic system
(1) as a specific chiral recognition host for enantiopure trans-1,2-cyclohexanediamine (2) is reported.
Host 1 with an inherent free phenolic group and a (1S)-camphanate chiral handle on the opposite terminal rings
of the helicene chromophore acted as an efficient turn on fluorescent
sensor for S,S-2 with
an excellent enantioselective factor, α = KSS/KRR = 6.3 in benzene. This specific host–guest interaction
phenomenon is found to be solvent-dependent, which leads to an enantioselective
chiral (camphanate) group transfer to the diamine guest molecule.
In the case of R,R-2, the de value is up to 68% even at room temperature. Intriguingly,
the induced helicity in dioxa[6]helicene diol 6, upon
supramolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions, is of opposite sense
with positive helicity for S,S-2 and negative helicity for R,R-2, as shown by circular dichroism spectroscopy and
in combination with theoretical calculations. This chiral supramolecular
system is found to be an excellent host–guest pair for enantiomeric
recognition of 2, based on their electronic and steric
factors.

Introduction
The significance of
chirality is well-recognized in most natural
systems, which are generally based on supramolecular host–guest
interactions. Additionally, different industries such as food, agrochemical,
and pharmaceuticals favor the use of enantiopure molecules. Besides
the preparation of chiral molecules, analysis of their chiral purity
with high accuracy and precision is crucial for various applications.
Chiral sensors with fluorescence as a detection tool are of particular
interest owing to their quick response time and high sensitivity with
very low detection limits; thus, they are gaining considerable attention
so far. Generally, sensors suitable for a wide range of compounds
are most abundant in terms of applicability.1 However, the presence of more than one chiral guest may result in
binding competition, generating inaccuracy or even mistakes. Therefore,
a sensor with a stereospecific recognition ability2 toward a certain guest possessing less substrate scope
and thus tolerating the presence of other substrates is in high demand.

In the quest for such specific host–guest systems, we developed
a novel nonresolvable, stereodynamically labile heterohelicene3 chromophore-based camphanate ester 1(3b) as a suitable chirogenic host and tested
it for the chiral sensing application (Figure 1). Despite their unique steric and electronic
properties, helicenes have not been widely exploited as supramolecular
systems for chiral recognition yet.4 To
fill this gap, varied bidentate functionalities including 1,1′-bi-2-naphthol,
hydroxyl acids, amines, diamines, amino alcohols (see Supporting Information) have been screened as
potential guests. It turned out that specifically only trans-1,2-cyclohexanediamine, 2, gave an enantioselective
recognizable turn on sensing response. Indeed, 2 has
been often used as an effective guest for many supramolecular systems
owing to its profound hydrogen bonding and coordination ability with
metal ions.5 Additionally,
Pu et al. reported its nucleophilic addition to an electron-deficient
trifluromethyl ketone group in chiral biaryls for use as a turn on
sensor for the general class of diamines and amino alcohols.5a−5c

Results and Discussion
Host 1 exhibits absorption
and emission maxima at
347 and 395 nm, respectively, in benzene and toluene (see Supporting Information). Upon interaction with 2, there is a formation of the corresponding 1:1 complex,
as indicated by a Job’s plot analysis (see Supporting Information). Host 1 behaves as an
efficient enantioselective turn on sensor with a stereospecific difference
ratio, ef = ΔFS/ΔFR, of 6.3 in
benzene and 1.93 in toluene (at 1:1 host–guest ratio), where
ΔFS and ΔFR are changes in the fluorescence
intensity of 1 in the presence of S,S-2 and R,R-2 (see Figure 2). The association constants and Gibbs free energies (ΔG0) at 298 K for the corresponding diastereomeric
supramolecular complexes are summarized in Tables S3 and S6. For both enantiomers, the ΔG0 values are negative, indicating energetically favorable
host–guest interactions. However, the energy in the case of
the S,S-enantiomer is 1.1 kcal mol–1 being lower than that of R,R-2, reflecting its higher thermodynamic stability
in benzene. Benzene and toluene, both being nonpolar and non-hydrogen-bonded
aromatic solvents, preferentially recognize only the S,S-2 enantiomer. However, the distinctive
behavior of fluorescence responses of 1 to 2 in these solvents is attributed to different solvent-effect parameters
including the extent of favorable hydrogen bonding and solute–solvent
π–π stacking interactions.6 Comparatively, more polar halogenated solvents
such as chloroform gave a rather weak recognition for R,R-2 with an ef value of only 1.29,
whereas in highly polar protic solvents such as methanol, no detectable
chiral recognition was observed. By contrast, polar aprotic solvents,
such as acetonitrile, showed a moderate sensing ability with an ef
of 1.55 for R,R-2 with
emission shifted at a longer wavelength of 405 nm. Furthermore, polar-coordinating
solvent tetrahydrofuran (THF) showed a fluorescence quenching phenomenon,
favoring R,R-2. This
remarkable solvent
dependence is apparently due to the existence of supramolecular hydrogen-bonding
interactions between host 1 and guest 2 followed
by a possible unidirectional switch in the helical conformation of
the helicene chromophore governed by the polarity and type of solvent
used. Indeed, there are several reports on the solvent control of
supramolecular chirality recognition.6 In
turn, this can also be responsible for the stereoselectivity inversion
of 2 enantiomers. To confirm the conformational switch
in helicene chromophore, circular dichroism (CD) measurements of host 1 were taken in different solvents (see Supporting Information). A rather weak CD signal with a negative
Cotton effect (CE) in the range of 350–360 nm of helicene absorption
was detected in nonpolar solvents such as benzene, toluene, cyclohexane,
and chloroform. However, the CD response in more polar, aprotic solvents,
such as acetonitrile and THF, gave positive CE in the same region
(see Supporting Information). This solvent-dependent
opposite trend in the CD spectrum can be attributed only to the conformational
changes occurring in different solvents.6 Thus, it is concluded that this solvent-dependent switching to a
specific stereodynamic conformational feature is responsible for the
inversion of chiral recognition observed in fluorescence as helicity
also plays a key role in controlling the enantiomer recognition of 2.

Figure 2 Fluorescence spectra of 1 (6.9 × 10–6 M) in the presence of 1:1 (S,S)-2 and (R,R)-2 (a) in benzene (slit width 7.5, 7.5) and (b) in toluene
(slit width 5.0, 5.0).

In particular, it is most likely that the phenolic group
of host 1 acts as a proton donor to one of the amino
groups of 2, whereas it may further accept hydrogen bonding
from another
amino group via a lone electron pair of the phenolic oxygen. In addition,
this amino group can also interact with the camphanate ester group
of 1 via its lone pair under the overall steric crowding
arrangement of the chiral camphanate handle to result in a rigid structure
responsible for its turn on response (see Figure 3).7,8

Figure 3 Proposed supramolecular
complex between host 1 and R,R-2 enantiomer in benzene.
(a) Schematic view and (b) 3D ball and stick model (only selected
hydrogen atoms are displayed for better clarity).

With this hypothesis in mind, a bulkier 1,2-diamine, such
as 1,2-diphenyl
ethylenediamine, 3 was investigated. As expected, the
host failed to exhibit any stereospecific recognition behavior in
the case of 3, indicating that two bulky phenyl groups
were unable to fit into the cavity provided by the chiral camphanate
handle. Thus, it is evident that the intramolecular spatial arrangement
of 1, particularly the distance between phenolic hydroxyl
and camphanate ester and the size of the formed cavity, was exclusively
suitable to fit 2 to ensure efficient hydrogen-bonding
interactions. The inference was
further evaluated with model host 4, which has a similar
free phenolic group and attached chiral camphanate handle. Hosts 1 and 4 differ in shape and size of the chiral
pockets provided by the camphanate ester group owing to varying distance
and spatial arrangement toward the phenolic hydroxyl group required
for hydrogen bonding. As expected, the model compound 4 failed to exhibit any enantiodiscrimination fluorescence response
for 2. This result further supported the existence of
co-operative binding between the phenolic hydroxyl and the camphanate
chiral handle of 1 from one side and two amino groups
of 2 from another side, which is an essential prerequisite
for the observed chiral recognition. Similar studies with the helicene
camphorsulfonate, 5, in which the camphor moiety is attached
via a longer spacer, were not successful owing to an increase in the
distance between two interaction points, thus indicating co-operative
origin of the chiral recognition mechanism in our supramolecular system.

To further understand the mechanistic details of this host–guest
assembly, corresponding nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies were
performed (see Experimental Section). The
C1 proton of the host initially appearing at 8.8 ppm exhibited a distinct
downfield chemical shift (Δδ) of 0.1 ppm at the 1:1 host–guest
ratio (see Supporting Information) owing
to the hydrogen-bonding interactions in the host–guest complex.
Furthermore, surprisingly, the initial clean solution obtained upon
mixing the two components started to precipitate after 1–2
h at room temperature. The corresponding 1H NMR spectra
recorded at different time intervals of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 h after
mixing revealed that a chiral camphanate group transfer reaction takes
place (see Figure 4).9 In particular, host 1 being dissymmetric in nature showed all nine aromatic proton signals
spreading over the range of 7.1–8.8 ppm. Slowly with time,
the intensity of C1 proton starts to decrease with the simultaneous
appearance of a new peak at 8.5 ppm. After 3 h, most of the original
signals of the host completely disappeared, and a new set of symmetrical
signals appeared. At the end of the reaction, the C1 proton was considerably
shifted upfield to 8.3 ppm (Δδ = 0.5 ppm). Furthermore,
the two different protons at C3 and C10, appearing as double doublets
(dd) with ortho and meta couplings, at 7.5 and 7.8 ppm merged together
to give rise to one dd signal at 7.25 ppm with the integration of
two protons. Similarly, other signals were also merged together to
generate a simplified, symmetric 1H NMR pattern (see Figure 4).

Figure 4 Time-dependent changes
observed in 1H NMR spectra of
host 1 with 1:1 (R,R)-2 in CDCl3.

The newly generated NMR spectrum has only five signals in
the aromatic
region (between 7.2 and 8.3 ppm), each for two protons. This is a
result of the formation of C2-symmetric
dioxa[6]helicene diol 6 via the chiral camphanate group
transfer reaction to guest R,R-2 (see Scheme 1). The same reaction with S,S-2 enantiomer takes more than 4 h, longer time than with R,R-2 enantiomer owing to
the highly efficient chiral recognition ability of this supramolecular
system. On the basis of these NMR studies, the rate of the reaction
was calculated to be 5.83 × 10–6 and 5.97 ×
10–7 mol dm−3 s–1 for R,R-2 and S,S-2, respectively. The difference
in the rate constants encouraged us to apply this enantioselective
group transfer reaction for kinetic resolution of racemic 2. For this purpose, host 1 was separately mixed with R,R-2 (in a 1:1 ratio) and
with rac-2 (in 1:2 ratio) (see Supporting Information) followed by NMR recording.
The product of the reaction of R,R-2 with 1 gave a distinct signal at 6.38
ppm, which corresponds to the amidic proton of 7. However,
a similar reaction for kinetic resolution of rac-2 with 1 resulted in peaks at 6.68 ppm (16%, S,S-enantiomer) and 6.39 ppm (84%, R,R-enantiomer) with a de value of 68%
for R,R-enantiomer. It can be noted
that for kinetic resolution R,R-2 is preferred over S,S-2, whereas S,S-2 enantiomer is preferably recognized with enhanced fluorescence in
nonpolar solvents. Thus, kinetic resolution is a kinetically controlled
phenomenon, whereas diastereomeric supramolecular complex formation
responsible for fluorescence recognition is thermodynamically preferred.

Scheme 1 Chiral Camphanate Group Transfer Reaction between Host 1 and Guest 2 in Chloroform
The expected mechanism of this group transfer reaction
involves
a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl group of phenolic ester of host 1, as a consequence of the enhanced nucleophilicity of amino
groups in 2 owing to the presence of the adjacent β-amino
group. This further supports our proposed model (see Figure 3) where the second amino group
interacts with the phenolic ester group and not with the lactone group
of the camphanate handle. This nucleophilic property of 2 has been successfully exploited in developing fluorescence and NMR
sensors using C2-symmetric biaryl hosts.5a−5c This system forms the corresponding 1:2 adduct with the excess of 2, and the mechanism involves several stepwise addition and
elimination steps, which are very distinguishable over the course
of the reaction. In comparison, in our case, the reaction is completed
within 4 h, which is comparatively fast with the regenerated 6 parent helicene diol. Similar NMR studies with with meso-3 show no noticeable stereoselectivity
with the same hosts, further indicating the high specificity of host 1 exclusively toward guest 2.

Additionally,
it appears that especially chloroform as a solvent
assists this group transfer reaction by generating achiral helicene
diol 6, yet it does so with quenched fluorescence without
any recognition abilities in fluorescence. However, host 6 is found to be ∼20 times more fluorescent than host 1 (see Supporting Information).
Thus, it is most likely that the fluorescence turn on response of 1 for S,S-2 in benzene and toluene is due to the formation of a thermodynamically
stable rigid supramolecular complex. In nonpolar solvents, the non-covalent
interaction would be preferred involving a hydroxyl group and carbonyl
group of 1, whereas in polar solvents, the primary interaction
could be an approach of nucleophilic nitrogen toward electrophilic
carbonyl carbon, involving partial separation of charges stabilized
by polar solvents. Both of these situations would necessitate different
helical conformations of 1 for a steric fit, resulting
in the recognition of opposite enantiomers of 2 depending
on the solvent polarity.

Hence, host 1 is a sui
generis example for specific
chiral recognition, as a result of the suitable distance between the
free phenolic and phenolic ester groups with limited space under camphanate
cavity to fit 2 exclusively. The proposed model for the
supramolecular interaction between the host and the guest in nonpolar
aromatic solvents can assist the chiral group transfer reaction observed
in chloroform. To support the validity of this model, we anticipated
that in the parent helicene diol 6, the two phenolic
groups have suitable distance to interact with 2 via
phenol–amine hydrogen bonding.8 This
supramolecular interaction will induce specific helicity into the
achiral stereodynamically labile helicene chromophore 6 that in turn can be easily monitored by CD spectroscopy.7 Host 6 exists as two fast interconvertible
helical conformations, which cannot be resolved, yielding a CD silent
spectrum. To our delight, the S,S-2 enantiomer induced specific helical conformation
in 6 to show positive CE at 345 nm, whereas the R,R-2 enantiomer resulted
in a mirror image negative CE. The CD intensity, Δε, is
up to ±0.42 cm–1 M–1 in the
region of helicene chromophore absorption (Figure 5b). Upon interactions with the enantiomers
of 2, the conformational dynamic equilibrium of 6 is shifted to one of the two possible helicities, subsequently
inducing the CD activity (Figure 5d).10 This confirms that
the opposite enantiomers induce opposite helicities in the parent
helicene chromophore. A Job’s plot analysis unambiguously confirmed
the 1:1 stoichiometry between 6 and 2 on
complexation, as studied by UV–vis spectroscopy (see Supporting Information).

Intriguingly, the P-conformer of the parent helicene
diol 6 (Figure 5c) exhibits negative CE at the low-energy absorption band
corresponding to 1La electronic transition,
as determined by the theoretical calculation at the RI-CC2/def2-TZVP//DFT-D3(BJ)-TPSS/def2-TZVP
level (Figure 5a).11

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have
successfully developed dioxa[6]helicene-based
host 1 as a turn on fluorescence sensor for specific
chiral recognition of trans-2. This
solvent-dependent fluorescence detection is a thermodynamically favored
phenomenon, as evidenced by the negative Gibbs free energy. The 1H NMR studies showed that the chiral camphanate group transfer
reaction occurring in chloroform is 10 times faster for R,R-2, indicating a kinetically controlled
mechanism. Besides, the potential host 1 has been applied
for kinetic resolution of rac-2 with
68% de. Furthermore, the parent helicene diol 6 showed
induced CD spectra with the corresponding enantiomers of 2, which in combination with the theoretical studies further confirm
the proposed host–guest interaction mechanism. This supramolecular
system is a unique example of specific chirality sensing. Further
extension of these studies and application for other supramolecular
systems are currently under progress and will be reported in due course.
We believe that the phenomenon of controlling helical conformation
via chiral auxiliary and solvent polarity will undoubtedly give a
new dimension to the area of development of chirality sensors using
stereodynamic probes.

Methods
Fluorescence
Sensing
Before recording the fluorescence,
the hosts were crystallized or passed through the short alumina column
each time. The freshly purified hosts were used for fluorescence studies.
The stock solution of the host (6.9 × 10–5 M)
was prepared by dissolving 0.9 mg of 1 in 25 mL of solvent.
From this stock solution, 1 mL was pipetted out and transferred to
various 10 mL standard flasks containing 0.0 (blank), 0.2, 0.4, 0.6,
0.8, and 1.0 equiv of (1R,2R)-2 and (1S,2S)-2 in two separate sets of experiments. The flasks were kept at room
temperature for 4 h before recording their fluorescence responses.

NMR Sensing
Experiment A
In an NMR sample, 10.4
mg of 1 in 0.5 mL of CDCl3 was mixed with
5.6 mg of (1R,2R)-2 in a vial to obtain
a 1:1 host–guest ratio. The clean solution obtained upon mixing 1 and 2 started to precipitate on standing in
the NMR tube at 25 °C. 1H NMR of the mixture was recorded
at different time intervals after mixing, which confirmed the chiral
group transfer reaction. The similar experiment with racemic 2 showed the enantioselective nature of this group transfer
reaction.

Experiment B
In a different set
of experiments, 10.4
mg of 1 was dissolved in 0.5 mL of CDCl3 containing
5.6 mg of (1S,2S)-2 to obtain a 1:1 host–guest ratio. The 1H NMR spectra
of the mixture were recorded at different time intervals to study
the kinetics of the group transfer reaction. A similar kinetic experiment
was also performed with (1R,2R)-2 enantiomer.

CD Studies
A 1
× 10–4 M solution
of 1:1 host 6 and guest (1S,2S)-2 and (1R,2R)-2 was separately prepared using chloroform as a solvent.
The induced CD spectra were measured for 400–280 nm with a
10 nm/min scan speed and 5 accumulations at 25 °C.
