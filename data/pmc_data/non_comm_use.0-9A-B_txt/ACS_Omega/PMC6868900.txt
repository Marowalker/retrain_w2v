The three-component
coupling reaction of 1,1-dibromoalkenes 1, vinylzinc
chloride 2, and carbon soft nucleophiles 3 was realized in the presence of the catalytic palladium/Xantphos
species, and 1,3-disubstituted allenic products 5 were
obtained in yields of up to 77%. The successive two palladium-catalyzed
processes, namely the cross-coupling reaction and the allylic substitution,
assembled 5 from the easily accessible starting compounds.

Introduction
Allenes have emerged
as unique building blocks in synthetic organic
chemistry,1 and their convenient synthetic
methods have been highly desirable. Construction of allenic C=C=C
frameworks by multicomponent coupling reactions of easily accessible
compounds is an attractive procedure for preparing allenic compounds.

In 2000, we developed a palladium-catalyzed reaction for preparing
various functionalized allenes 5 starting with 1-hydrocarbyl-2-bromo-1,3-dienes 4 and appropriate soft nucleophiles 3 (Scheme 1).2 By the use of a chiral palladium catalyst, the reaction
could provide scalemic axially chiral allenes 5 in up
to 94% ee.3 The reaction proceeds via (alkylidene-π-allyl)palladium
intermediate B,4 that is somewhat
similar to the widely accepted intermediates in the Tsuji–Trost
reaction.5 An analogous (alkylidene-π-allyl)palladium
species can be generated by the addition of an allenylmethyl ester
to a zero-valent palladium species and its reaction with a soft nucleophile
gives a comparable allenic product as well.6 Bromodiene substrates 4 were prepared by the regioselective
cross-coupling reaction between 1,1-dibromoalkenes 1 and
vinylzinc chloride 2 in the presence of catalytic Pd(PPh3)4.2a The two reaction
steps shown in Scheme 1 are analogous to each other; both are palladium-catalyzed processes
which involve the oxidative addition of an olefinic C–Br bond
to a zero-valent palladium species, and generated palladium(II) intermediates A or B react with nucleophilic reagents subsequently
(Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Reported
“Stepwise” Process of Preparing 1,3-Disubstituted
Allenes Using Two Different Palladium Precatalysts
Due to the close similarity of the two palladium-catalyzed
reactions,
we envisioned that if we could manage both reaction steps in “one-pot”
in the presence of a single palladium species starting with a mixture
of three reactants 1, 2, and 3, the whole reaction could be a unique three-component coupling reaction
giving allenic compounds 5 by a single operation (Scheme 2). After the extensive
optimization of the reaction conditions, indeed, the three-component
coupling reactions have been realized. Here, we report details of
our efforts toward this goal.

Scheme 2 Palladium-Catalyzed Three-Component
Coupling of Preparing 1,3-Disubstituted
Allenes
Results and Discussion
In the previous reports,2a the two different
palladium precatalysts were employed in the respective reaction steps
in Scheme 1. While
Pd(PPh3)4 (1.5 mol %) was chosen as a suitable
precatalyst in the regioselective cross-coupling reaction of 1 with 2, the reaction between 3 and 4 was catalyzed by a palladium species (2.0 mol
%) generated in situ from [PdCl(π-allyl)]2 and 2,2′-bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1′-biphenyl
(dpbp).7 Under the reported conditions,
the two palladium species were not interconvertible. That is, the
cross-coupling reaction between 1a and 2 was much slower and much less regioselective in the presence of
the Pd/dpbp species (1.5 mol %) instead of Pd(PPh3)4. The reaction showed ca. 20% conversion and the formation
of triene 6a was dominant under the otherwise identical
conditions. Alternatively, the use of Pd(PPh3)4 (2.0 mol %) in the reaction between 3m and 4a provided the desired allenic product 5am in less than
a 1% yield (Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Specificity of Palladium Precatalysts in Converting 1a to 5am via 4a
At the outset, a possibility of the three-component coupling was
investigated for the reaction between 1a, a vinyl nucleophile
(2, 2′, or 2″),
and 3m. The results of the screening are summarized in Table 1. A treatment of 1a with 2 (1.5 equiv) and 3m (1.5
equiv) in the presence of a palladium species generated from [Pd(π-allyl)Cl]2 and dpbp (2.5 mol %) at 60 °C in THF for 24 h gave a
mixture of 1a, 4a, 6a, and 5am in 44:2:51:3 molar ratio (determined by 1H
NMR; entry 1). The use of vinyltin reagent 2′
instead of 2 led to complete consumption of 1a, however, a considerable amount of uncharacterized species was formed
together with 4a and 6a. Allene 5am was not detected in the reaction mixture (entry 2). The reaction
with vinylmagnesium chloride 2″ was very messy
and the formation of 5am was not observed (entry 3).
From the results in entries 1–3, zinc reagent 2 was chosen as a vinyl nucleophile. Preformed Pd(PPh3)4 was slightly more effective than the Pd/dpbp species giving
a mixture of 4a, 6a, and 5am in 28:60:12 molar ratio. Although 1a was completely
consumed, the main product was triene 6a, and the formation
of allene 5am was still minimal (entry 4). The Pd/dppf
precatalyst8 gave 4a as a
major product, with a small amount of 5am (entry 5).
The yield of 5am was improved to 31% by the use of DPEphos9 as an ancillary ligand, and the formation of 6a was somewhat suppressed (entry 6). Reducing the amount
of 2 (1.0 equiv) or lowering the reaction temperature
(40 °C) did not improve the 6a/5m ratios, while
the reactions were slower (entries 7 and 8). Running the reaction
at 80 °C in 1,4-dioxane dramatically improved the yield of 5am to 62% (entry 9). The use of a palladium species generated
from [Pd(π-allyl)Cl]2 and Xantphos9 further improved the selectivity of the reaction and 5am was isolated in a 77% yield (entry 10). The combination
of Pd(dba)2 and Xantphos was equally effective for the
reaction to give 5am in a 74% isolated yield (entry 11).

Due to air-stability
and easier handling of Pd(dba)2, the conditions of entry
11 in Table 1 were
chosen as the optimized conditions, and the reactions
with various dibromoolefins 1 and nucleophiles 3 were conducted in the same way. The results of the three-component
coupling are summarized in Table 2. The reaction works well with various 1-aryl-2,2-dibromoethylenes 1a–f (entries 1–6). A wide range of aryl substituents,
such as electron-rich (1b, 1d, and 1f), electron-poor (1c), bulky (1d–f), and organometallic (1f) aryl groups, can be employed
in 1, and their reactions with 2 and 3m afforded the corresponding allenic products in good yields
ranging 51–74%. On the other hand, aliphatic dibromoolefins 1g–i showed different results in the reaction with 2 and 3m, depending on the alkyl substituents.
While substrate 1g, which is with a bulky tert-butyl substituent, gave allene 5gm in a 62% yield (entry
7), 1h (with a sec-alkyl, cyclohexyl,
group) provided allene 5hm in a 14% yield (entry 8) and
the reaction of 1i (with a primary alkyl, n-octyl, group) did not give allenic products (entry 9). The major
products in the reactions of 1h or 1i were
the corresponding bromodienes 4 and trienes 6.

Xantphos.

c Isolated yield by silica gel chromatography.

The present protocol could be applicable
to the other carbon soft
nucleophiles as well. Sodium salts 3n and 3o, which are from ethylmalonate and phenylmalonate, reacted with 1a in the same way to give the allenic products in 68 and
69% yields, respectively (entries 10 and 11). The reaction of 3p, that is an anionic derivative from parent malonate, was
sluggish and the yield of 5ap was 33% (entry 12). Bis(sulphonyl)methane-derived
nucleophiles, 3q and 3r, could be used in
the present protocol affording the allenic products in 49 and 61%
yields, respectively (entries 13 and 14). Allenes 5ap, 5aq, and 5ar possess acidic hydrogen
in them, and thus, they are capable of functioning as carbon soft
nucleophiles, which may lead to the formation of bis-allenes 7 by the second three-component coupling with 1 and 2. However, bis-allenes 7 were not
detected in the 1H NMR spectra nor isolated in all of the
cases (entries 12–14). The reaction with nitrogen-nucleophile 3s was messy and the desired allenic product was not obtained,
although 1a was completely consumed (entry 15). It should
be mentioned that the reaction between preformed 4a and 3s catalyzed by Pd/dpbp gave the allenic product in an 89%
yield.2a

Plausible reaction pathways
in the present three-component coupling
reaction are outlined in Scheme 4. Whereas 1a did not react with 3m in the absence of 2 under the optimized conditions,
the initial formation of bromodiene 4 from 1 and 2 is almost certain. Indeed, a reaction of 1a with 2 (1.0 equiv to 1a) without 3m under the same conditions afforded 4a, together
with unreacted 1a and 6a (1a/4a/6a = 14:77:9 molar ratio determined
by the 1H NMR measurement). The oxidative addition of 4 to the Pd(0) species forms C, which is in equilibrium
with B with the dissociation of the bromide ligand from
the palladium center.4a Intermediate C reacts with 2 to give triene 6, the major side-product of the present protocol, via D by the standard cross-coupling process. On the other hand, (alkylidene-π-allyl)palladium
intermediate B reacts with 3, just like
the Tsuji–Trost reaction, to give allene 5. Due
to the wide bite-angle of Xantphos,9 the
palladium center in C is rather congested. Whereas the
alkylidene-π-allyl ligand in B is much more compact4a than the combination of the σ-butadienyl/bromo
ligands in C, the congestion at the palladium atom is
somewhat diminished in B. As a consequence, Xantphos
in B/C might drive the equilibrium toward B, leading to a higher yield of allene 5.

Conclusions
We have established
the three-component coupling reaction of 1,1-dibromoalkenes 1, vinylzinc chloride 2, and carbon soft nucleophiles 3 leading to various 1,3-disubstituted allenes 5 in yields of up to 77%. The reaction is effectively catalyzed by
the palladium/Xantphos species, and the successive two palladium-catalyzed
processes, namely the cross-coupling reaction and the allylic substitution
like the Tsuji–Trost reaction, assembled the allenic products
in good yields from the easily accessible starting compounds.

General Information
All anaerobic and/or moisture-sensitive
manipulations were carried out with standard Schlenk techniques under
predried nitrogen or with glove box techniques under prepurified argon. 1H NMR (at 400 MHz) and 13C NMR (at 101 MHz) chemical
shifts are reported in ppm downfield of internal tetramethylsilane.
Tetrahydrofuran and 1,4-dioxane were distilled from benzophenone-ketyl
under nitrogen prior to use. Pd(PPh3)4,10 [Pd(π-allyl)Cl]2,11 Pd(dba)2,12 dpbp,7 DPEphos,9 and 1,3-benzodithiole-1,1,3,3-tetraoxide (BDT)13 were prepared as reported. All other chemicals were obtained
from commercial sources and used without additional purification.

1,1-Dibromo-1-alkenes (1a–i)
These compounds
were prepared from the commercially available aldehydes by the reported
methods14 and were characterized by comparison
of their NMR spectra with those reported previously (1a,151b,15,161c,15,161d,16,171e,16,181f,181g,191h,20 and 1i(3b)).

Palladium-Catalyzed Three-Component Coupling
Reaction of 1,
2, and 3
The reaction conditions and the results are summarized
in Table 2. A general
procedure is given below. To a mixture of 1 (0.45–0.50
mmol), 3-H (1.5 equiv to 1), NaH (1.6 equiv
to 1), Pd(dba)2 (2.5 mol %), and Xantphos
(3.0 mol %) in 1,4-dioxane (5 mL) was added a suspension of vinylzinc
chloride, which was prepared from vinylmagnesium chloride (1.4 mol/L
solution in THF; 1.5 equiv to 1) and dry ZnCl2 (1.6 equiv to 1) in 1,4-dioxane (2 mL), and the mixture
was stirred for 24 h at 80 °C. The reaction mixture was filtrated
through a short pad of silica gel, and the silica gel pad was washed
with a small amount of Et2O three times. The combined organic
solution was evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure. The residue
was chromatographed on silica gel to give allene 5 in
the pure form. The characterization data of the allenic products are
listed below.
