Unusual
polypyrrole/graphene/cellulose nanofibril (PPy/GR/CNF)
composite particles were fabricated by introducing an in situ oxidative
polymerization approach. Structural characterization of the composite
particles showed foam-like network morphology with a large surface
area of 621 m2/g. The PPy/GR/CNF sample exhibited remarkable
capacitance behavior in 1 M Na2SO4. It showed
a high specific capacitance of 264.3 F/g at 0.25 A/g, which represents
a 51.7% increase compared to that of PPy/GR and a high capacitance
of 155.5 F/g even at a high current density of 5 A/g. Meanwhile, it
possessed high rate capability and good cycling performance (85.7%
capacitance retention even after 1000 cycles). These excellent electrochemical
performances were attributed to the structure of PPy/GR/CNF that can
provide large surface areas and shorten electron diffusion pathways.
More importantly, the CNF stabilized the structure of PPy and prevented
chain breakdown during the charge/discharge process, which improved
the cycling performance. Hence, this PPy/GR/CNF composite shows great
potential for the fabrication of high-capacitance and low-cost supercapacitor
electrode materials with good cycling performance.

Introduction
With the development of science and technology,
portable electronic
devices and wearable electronic products have emerged and have been
developed rapidly.1,2 At the same time, flexible energy
storage devices also have received extensive attention.3,4 Supercapacitors (SCs) are a new type of energy storage devices that
have been developed in recent decades. They have the characteristics
of high power density, long cycle life, and good low-temperature performance.5 They are considered as a bridge connecting the
traditional dielectric capacitor and the lithium-ion battery. The
most important part of the supercapacitors is the electrode. Carbon
materials are usually used as the basis materials for the electrode
materials of supercapacitors. However, carbon materials generally
have the disadvantage of weak conductivity. In response to this shortcoming,
graphene (GR)6,7 has been developed rapidly. Because
of its unique sp2 hybridization structure, GR has the characteristics
of ultrahigh conductivity, large specific surface area, good thermal
conductivity, and good stability. Therefore, it can be used as the
electrode material by itself, and it has also been widely used as
the electrode material for supercapacitors.

However, because
of its characteristics, GR is prone to exhibit
accumulation behavior, which makes it difficult to fully reflect its
electrical conductivity and specific surface area. Moreover, carbon
materials exhibit only double-layer electrochemical behavior, which
limits the storage capacity of the electrode materials. Therefore,
we added polypyrrole (PPy) to improve the pseudocapacitance of the
composite electrode materials. PPy can exhibit extremely high pseudocapacitance
through redox reactions between the electrolyte and N-containing species,
which act as electron donors.8 PPy has
outstanding characteristics, such as straightforward synthesis, high
electrical conductivity, large pseudocapacitance, and cost-effectiveness.9 For these reasons, PPy is one of the most studied
conducting polymers.

Recently, composites based on conducting
polymers and high-power
density materials, such as metallic compounds,10 CNTs,11 GR oxide,12 inorganic oxides,13 and GR,14 have been studied as a supercapacitor
electrode. One outstanding example of these composite materials is
PPy/GR, which can be fabricated by a simple method and shows the properties
of GR, such as a two-dimensional carbon nanostructure, excellent electronic
transport properties, good mechanical stiffness, and high thermal
and electronic conductivity.15−19 Biswas and Drzal prepared a PPy/GR composite using a simple and
effective ultrasonication comixing method and reported its specific
capacitance (SC) to be 165 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g.20 Although several efforts have since been made,
unfortunately, the electrochemical performance of PPy has yet to be
improved upon. There are two reasons for this: (1) the composite materials
have inaccessible surfaces, which considerably reduce the actual capability
of the capacitance and (2) CPs commonly undergo structural breakdown
because of the considerable volume change induced by the repeated
intercalation and depletion of ions. The results show that the cyclic
stability of composites is poor.21,22

To solve
this problem, we added nanocellulose to improve the wettability
of the composites and to increase the contact between the composites
and the electrolyte. Cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs), which are derived
from natural cellulose fibrils by controlled acid hydrolysis, have
drawn considerable interest owing to their various attractive properties,
such as the high density of active surface groups, high aspect ratio,
large specific surface area, good water dispersibility, attractive
mechanical properties, and prospect for environmental sustainability.23,24 Furthermore, CNFs have a multichannel mesoporous structure, which
is ideal for the absorption and transport of water and essential ions
through the outer and inner surfaces of fibers, acting as an electrolyte
reservoir.25 These features make the CNF
composite of PPy particularly interesting for enhancing the performance
of supercapacitors.26−29

In this work, the electrode material for the foam-like network
structure containing PPy and GR was successfully synthesized via a
CNF-assisted, facile, low-energy, in situ polymerization method. The
advantages of using CNFs for enhancing the electrochemical properties
of PPy/GR are as follows: (1) the natural structure of CNFs allowed
them to form an expanded network structure and (2) they act like a
template to adsorb Py monomers onto the structure of CNFs during the
subsequent polymerization step. It is worth nothing that we explored
the effects of CNF concentration on the electrochemical properties
of the composite particles; they have not been studied by any research
group as well. We prepared five composites with different weights
of CNFs in order to obtain the best performance PPy/GR/CNF composite
material.

Experimental Section
Materials
Bleached wood pulp was
provided by Shandong
(Ri Zhao, China). GR was purchased from Tanfeng Tench Inc. Other common
reagents were purchased from Beijing Chemical Plant and are of analytical
grade. The combination of pretreatment and homogenization processes
improved the dispersion of CNFs in deionized water.

Preparation
of PPy/GR/CNF Composite Particles
PPy/GR/CNF
composite particles were prepared by an in situ chemical oxidative
polymerization method. In a typical procedure, 50 mg of GR was first
dispersed in deionized water containing CNFs (1 mg/mL). The whole
solution was ultrasonicated for 4 h. A 1 mL portion of pyrrole was
slowly added to this dispersion with stirring, followed by a slow
addition of 50 mL of FeCl3 solution. The resultant mixture
was stirred vigorously for 30 min to form the PPy nanocomposite in
the solution. The whole solution was then stirred for 24 h at 0–4
°C. After polymerization, the composite particles were filtered
and thoroughly washed with ethanol and deionized water in sequence
several times to ensure the removal of residual FeCl3 from
the composites. The mixture was finally dried at 65 °C overnight
to obtain the PPy/GR/CNF composite particles. Composite particles
containing 200, 100, 50, 25, and 0 mg of CNFs were denoted as PPy/GR/CNF-200,
PPy/GR/CNF-100, PPy/GR/CNF-50, PPy/GR/CNF-25, and PPy/GR, respectively.

Characterization and Measurement
The morphology of
the as-prepared products was studied using a scanning electron microscope
(Hitachi S-4800) operated at 20 kV. The chemical structure of PPy/GR/CNF-50
was ascertained by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR,
VERTES TOV), Raman spectra (Horiba Scientific LabRAM HR Evolution),
and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) measurements with an Escalab250xi
(Kratos AXIS SUPRA, 1486.69 eV). Nitrogen gas adsorption and desorption
isotherms were obtained with an ASAP 2020 instrument (Micromeritics,
USA) at 77 K. Composite particles were degassed at 100 °C for
12 h before the measurements. Their specific surface area was estimated
according to the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method
based on the adsorption isotherms. The electronic conductivity of
PPy/GR/CNF-50 was measured by four point probe resistivity meter (Guangzhou
4-probes Tesct, RTS-9). The sample was processed into 1×1 cm2 slices before characterization (<1 mm thickness). Thermogravimetry
analysis (TGA) was performed under a nitrogen flow from room temperature
to 600 °C at a heating rate of 20 °C/min using a TGA Q50
(TA Instruments).

Electrochemical Measurements
Dried
activated samples,
including PPy/GR/CNF-200, PPy/GR/CNF-100, PPy/GR/CNF-50, PPy/GR/CNF-25,
and PPy/GR were ground in an agate mortar. Working electrodes were
fabricated by mixing the sample with acetylene black and 60% polytetrafluoroethylene
in a mass ratio of 85:10:5. The mixture was dispersed in an aqueous
C2H5OH solution to form a homogeneous slurry,
which was then coated onto a stainless steel nickel foam (1.0 cm ×
1.0 cm) and dried under vacuum at 60 °C for 24 h. The mass loaded
onto the electrode was about 5 mg. The electrochemical performances
of the materials were evaluated with a CHI 760D electrochemical station
(CH Instruments, USA) by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge
(GCD) measurements, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
on a three-electrode system with a platinum electrode and a saturated
calomel reference electrode. Na2SO4 (1 M) solution
was used as the electrolyte and was purged with nitrogen for 15 min
prior to the measurements. The cell capacitance was determined from
the CV curve using the equation 1  where Cm is the
specific capacitance per unit mass of composite particles in the electrode
(F/g), I is the discharge current (A), Δt is the time elapsed for the discharge from −0.5
to 0.5 (V), ΔV is the voltage difference within
that time (s), a is the mass of the active substance
(composite particles) on the electrode (%), and m is the mass of the electrode (g).

Results and Discussion
To better understand the preparation process of PPy/GR/CNF, the
experimental process is schematically shown in Figure 1. GR was first dispersed in deionized water
with CNFs by ultrasonication. Then, pyrrole was added to the mixture
followed by slow addition of FeCl3 under stirring. At the
same time, the FeCl3 solution can enable Py to polymerize
into PPy, which is uniformly coated on the surface of GR and CNFs.
The solution was filtered, washed, and dried to get composite particles.
The presence of CNFs in composites led to the formation of an extended
foam-like network structure, which facilitated the accessibility of
the electrolyte. Clearly, the LED lamp was faintly lit when the PPy/GR/CNF-50
composite was part of the wire (Figure 1). The high electronic conductivity of the obtained
PPy/GR/CNF-50 was 4.99 S/cm.

Figure 2 shows the
SEM images of PPy, PPy/GR, and PPy/GR/CNF-50. The pure PPy shows polymer
domains with a diameter of 200 nm (Figure 2a,d). A thick coating of PPy on GR was observed
for PPy/GR (Figure 2b,e), whereas when CNFs were added under the same conditions, the
samples showed a different morphology from that of previous structures
(Figure 2c,f). The
decoration of PPy/GR with CNFs created a foam-like network structure,
which could increase the surface area and allow more access to the
electrolyte. The detailed microstructures of PPy/GR/CNF-50 were investigated;
PPy distributed on the surface of the CNF and changed the morphology
of PPy from particles to that of nanofibrils. During polymerization,
CNFs acted like a template to give PPy their nanofibril morphology.
This might be explained by the chemical interactions between the NH
groups of pyrrole and the OH groups on the surface of the CNF. With
the increase of CNF content in the composite particles, the structure
of nanofibrils (PPy distributed on the surface of the CNF) was formed
(Figure 2g,h). However,
a sheet-like morphology was found when the CNF was present in excess
in the composite particles, as shown in Figure 2i. This morphology may be attributed to the
presence of an even larger amount of OH groups from CNFs, which promoted
the formation of PPy on its surface.

It is well known that the Py monomer possessed a typical
conjugated
structure, which may facilely link with the surfaces of GR and CNFs
via π–π interaction or H-bonding.30 This would be further demonstrated by the FT-IR spectra,
as shown in Figure 3a. The FT-IR spectrum of CNFs appeared as a broad band at 3409 cm–1, which is the characteristic of the cellulose O–H
group. The band at 2916 cm–1 is attributed to the
asymmetric stretching vibration of C–H. The spectral features
of pure PPy were well known in the literature, and the spectrum shows
broad characteristic peaks derived from various stretching modes at
3400 cm–1 (N–H), 1560 cm–1 (C=C), and 1531 cm–1 (C–C).31 In the case of PPy/GR, it possessed all the
characteristic absorption peaks of PPy, but with weaker peak intensities
for the characteristic peaks of PPy. Therefore, it is evident that
PPy was indeed loaded onto the surface of GR via interactions such
as hydrogen bonding and π–π stacking between them.
When CNFs were added under the same conditions, the characteristic
absorption of CNFs in PPy/GR/CNF-50 appeared as weak shifting of the
characteristic bands, indicating the presence of PPy on CNFs. The
bands at 1531 cm–1(1544 cm–1 for
PPy/GR/CNF-50) are assigned to the C–C stretching vibrations
in the pyrrole ring. The observed shift of this band might be attributed
to the bonding between the −NH group in the pyrrole ring and
the −OH group of the CNF, as suggested by Johnston et al.32 However, there was the CNF absorption peak in
PPy/GR/CNF-50, possibly because the CNF was distributed in the material
and covered by a layer of PPy on the surface, covering its characteristic
peak. But compared with PPy/GR/CNF-50, PPy/GR/CNF-200 has a strong
absorption peak of CNF in 2916 cm−1, which may be
caused by the free CNF in the material. Thus, FT-IR results confirmed
the possible interaction between PPy, GR, and CNFs, which was responsible
for the successful formation of PPy/GR/CNF.

particles (a) and the Raman spectra of GR, CNF, GR/PPy, and PPy/GR/CNF-50
(b).

The Raman spectrum (Figure 3b) shows two peaks around 1340
cm–1 (D-band)
and 1550 cm–1 (G-band). The G-band peak at 1550
cm–1 that stemmed from E2g phonon vibrations
of sp2-bonded carbon atoms is a characteristic feature
of graphite layers, and the D-band peak at 1340 cm–1 attributed to the breathing mode of κ-point phonons with A1g symmetry is related to the defective graphitic structure
and disordered carbon (sp3 rich phase).33 The intensity ratio (IG/ID) indicated that the material has a high degree
of conjugation. It further shows that the composite material has good
electrical conductivity (Figure 4).34

(a) and PPy/GR/CNF-50 (b). O 1s XPS
spectra of PPy/GR/CNF-50 (c) and N 1s XPS spectra of PPy/GR/CNF-50
(d).

The chemical composition of PPy/GR
and PPy/GR/CNF-50 was determined
by XPS. XPS data suggest that PPy/GR contains 75.54 mol % carbon,
11.98 mol % oxygen, and a small amount of 12.48 mol % nitrogen. PPy/GR/CNF-50
contains 76.55 mol % carbon, 14.56 mol % oxygen, and 8.89 mol % nitrogen.
The addition of CNFs increases the overall oxygen content of the material,
which was caused by a large number of oxygen-containing functional
groups on the surface of CNFs. The XPS C 1s spectrum of PPy/GR shows
a single peak composed of sp2-bonded carbon (284.8 eV),
and its small tail contains sp3-bonded carbon (285.5 eV).
The XPS C 1s spectrum of PPy/GR/CNF-50 shows a single peak composed
of sp2-bonded carbon (284.8 eV) and sp3-bonded
carbon (285.4 eV), and its small tail contains C=O (287.8 eV)
and C–O (286.8 eV). The XPS O 1s spectrum of PPy/GR/CNF-50
shows a single peak composed of C–O (529.2 eV), and its small
tail contains C=O (530.9 eV). The XPS N 1s spectrum of PPy/GR/CNF-50
shows a single peak composed of N–H (399.7 eV), and its small
tail contains N– (400.8 eV). These indicate that CNFs and PPy
have been successfully added to the materials, and the materials had
a rich conjugate structure, which provides excellent conductivity
to the material.35 These results are also
consistent with those obtained by IR analysis and Raman analysis.
In addition, oxygen-containing groups on the surface of CNFs enhance
the wettability of electrodes and electrolytes, while the electron-rich
nitrogen also enhances the conductivity of carbon materials. Furthermore,
these surface heteroatom-doped functional groups could be used as
additional active sites of pseudo-capacitance to improve the electrochemical
properties of materials.

The N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms, as shown
in Figure 5, were used
to determine the surface area and the pore-size distribution of PPy/GR/CNF-50
as compared to PPy/GR. The nitrogen adsorption isotherms of PPy/GR/CNF-50
and PPy/GR (Figure 5a) show type II and type IV isotherm characteristics36 (characterized by a hysteresis loop). The BET surface area
of PPy/GR was calculated to be 135 m2/g, as described in
the literature.37 The reason for such a
low surface area of PPy/GR was the compact coating of PPy on the GR,
as demonstrated by SEM images. However, this value increased to 621
m2/g after CNF incorporation into the PPy/GR system. This
enhanced surface area could be attributed to the foam-like network
structure, which expanded the interspacing and thus increased the
surface area. As shown in Figure 5b, a hierarchical broad pore size distribution with
a combination of mesoporous (2–5 nm) and macroporous (>50
nm)
structures was obtained from the N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms.

The effect of CNF percentage on
the thermal stability of the composite
was analyzed by TGA, as shown in Figure 6. Most of the samples exhibited some release
of the absorbed moisture at approximately 100 °C. As to CNFs,
two stages were identified: (1) the degradation of CNFs involving
the formation of various anhydromonosaccharides (including levoglucosenone,
levoglucosan, and 1,6-anhydro-b-D-glucopyranose) from 257 to 436 °C38 and (2) the degradation of CNF–OH bonds
from 436 °C to 549 °C.39 Compared
with CNFs under the same conditions, it can be seen that PPy/GR shows
less mass loss, indicating its better thermal stability. The TGA curves
of PPy/GR and PPy/GR/CNF show a similar shape, where the profile of
PPy/GR/CNF lies between the profiles of CNF and PPy/GR. Moreover,
the similarities in the TGA profile between the CNF and PPy/GR suggest
the introduction of CNFs into the PPy/GR system.40 After that, the massive weight loss of PPy/GR/CNF-50 happened
at 291 °C which was higher than PPy/GR/CNF-200 (271 °C).
In other words, with the increase of CNF content in the PPy/GR system,
the PPy/GR/CNF exhibited bad thermal stability. This may be due to
the presence of higher amounts of −OH during the in situ polymerization
reaction and the intermolecular hydrogen bonding between CNF and PPy.41 The above results illustrate the influence of
CNF on the thermal stability of PPy/GR/CNF.

Figure 6 TGA curves of CNFs, PPy/GR,
PPy/GR/CNF-50, and PPy/GR/CNF-200.

CV is a potentiodynamic electrochemical measurement that can be
used to measure the specific capacitance of electrode materials. In
order to evaluate the effects of the incorporated CNF on the electrochemical
performance, we performed CV experiments, as shown in Figure 7a,b. Figure 7a shows the representative CV scans of all
samples performed at a scan rate of 100 mV/s in 1.0 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution, and obvious redox peaks cannot be
observed in all samples. This result could be explained by the transport
and diffusion of counterions into the structure, which was slow compared
to the rate of electron transfer in PPy at high scan rates.42 Nevertheless, PPy/GR/CNF-50 produced larger
currents than other samples, indicating that the incorporated CNF
enhanced the electrochemical performance of the GR/PPy composites.
To further explore the electrochemical properties of PPy/GR/CNF-50,
CV measurements were performed at different scan rates from 10 mV/s
to 100 mV/s, as shown in Figure 7b. The CV curves exhibited a distorted rectangular
shape, which suggests good capacitance behavior. However, the shape
of the CV curves gradually transformed from an ideal rectangle to
an oval with increasing scan rate. This may be attributable to the
inhibition of charge collection by the internal resistance of the
electrode, the low conductivity of Na2SO4 aqueous
solution, and the diffusion limitations of Na+ in the electrode.43

Figure 7 CV curves at a scan rate of 100 mV/s for all samples (a)
and at
different scan rates for PPy/GR/CNF-50 (b). GCD curves of all samples
at 1 A/g (c) and PPy/GR/CNF-50 at 0.25, 1, 2, and 5 A/g (d).

Figure 7c shows
the GCD curves of all the samples at a current density of 1 A/g. The
corresponding specific capacitance (SC) values were calculated using eq 1. The SC values of PPy/GR,
PPy/GR/CNF-25, PPy/GR/CNF-50, PPy/GR/CNF-100, and PPy/GR/CNF-200 were
83.3, 165.6, 223.8, 119.1, and 97.7 F/g, respectively. These results
agreed with the trends revealed by CV measurements. However, it can
be found from the results that the overall composite material is lower
than the high-performance and breathable PPy-coated air-laid paper
(3100 mF·cm–2 at 1 mA·cm–2) studied by Chen et al. and the ultrahigh performance and flexible
PPy-coated CNT paper electrode (8604.5 mF·cm–2 at 1 mA·cm–2) studied by Cai et al. It may
be caused by the partial agglomeration of GR. The SC of PPy/GR/CNF-50
was higher than that of other samples. The behavior of the capacitance
of PPy/GR/CNF-50 was examined at different current densities in the
range 0.25–5 A/g, as shown in Figure 7d. The discharge curve indicated the SC values
of 264.3, 223.8, 181.8, and 155.5 F/g at 0.25, 1, 2, and 5 A/g, respectively.
The steady decrease of SC could be attributed to the diffusion limitations
and the decrease of pseudocapacitance with increasing current density.44 However, all the GCD curves exhibited a nearly
symmetrical triangular shape and straight discharge slopes, suggesting
good electrochemical capacitive behavior with a small IR drop and
excellent reversibility of the charge/discharge process.45,46

The EIS technique was employed to explore the ionic/electronic
transport pathways in GR/PPy/CNF. Figure 8 shows the EIS curves of all samples, which
were used to investigate the redox (charge/discharge) process of electrode
materials and to evaluate their electronic and ionic conductivity.
The inset in Figure 8 corresponds to the high-frequency region of Nyquist plots. In the
high-frequency region, the diameter of the arc reflected the charge
transfer resistance (Rct), which is related
to the interfacial processes of counterions at the electrode/electrolyte
interface. The Rct values of all PPy/GR/CNFs
were significantly smaller than that of PPy/GR. PPy/GR/CNF-50 shows
the smallest Rct of approximately 1.57
Ω. After the semicircular region, a straight line at an angle
of 45° in the low-frequency range is observed, which corresponds
to the Warburg diffusion resulting from the frequency dependence of
ion diffusion/transport in the electrolyte.47 The larger Warburg resistance indicates greater variations in ion
diffusion path lengths and increases the obstruction of ion movement.35 It can be observed that the slope of the impedance
plots increased first and then decreased with increasing CNF content
in the composite particles, while that of PPy/GR/CNF-50 was the smallest.
The reduced resistance of the composite might be due to the foam-like
network structure of PPy/GR/CNF, which facilitated the efficient access
of electrolyte ions to the PPy/GR/CNF surface and shortened the ion
diffusion path. This agreed with the outcomes of SEM and CV tests.

Figure 8 EIS curves
of PPy/GR and PPy/GR/CNF.

To further explore the electrochemical properties of PPy/GR/CNF-50,
we compared the performances of PPy/GR/CNF-50 and PPy/GR, as shown
in Figure 9. The SC
values of PPy/GR/CNF-50 and PPy/GR at different current densities
were obtained from Figure 9a. The maximum value of 264.3 F/g was obtained at a current
density of 0.25 A/g, which represented a 51.7% increase compared with
that of PPy/GR. We conclude that the SC value obtained for GR/PPy/CNF-50
was higher than many previously reported values for the composite
based on PPy.3,48−51 Furthermore, the IR drop of PPy/GR
at 5 A/g was 0.34 V and that of PPy/GR/CNF-50 was only 0.15 V (Figure 9b). The lower IR
drop depended mainly on the smaller equivalent resistance and was
associated with more rapid diffusion and exchange of electrons and
counterions in PPy/GR/CNF-50.52 These results
are consistent with our observations of EIS and can most likely be
ascribed to the structure of the materials. As shown in Figure 9c, the cyclic stabilities of
PPy/GR/CNF-50 and PPy/GR were investigated by continuous charge/discharge
cycle tests at a current density of 5 A/g in the Na2SO4 electrolyte. The capacitance retention of PPy/GR/CNF-50 decreased
to 85.7% of its initial value over 1000 cycles, while the capacitance
retention fell to 71.5% for PPy/GR. The clearly enhanced cyclic stability
of the composite resulted from the electron-conductive pathways of
the interpenetrating conducting network of the CNF, which stabilized
the structure of PPy and prevented chain breakdown during the charge/discharge
process.

and IR drop (b) at different current densities; cycling performance

Conclusions
A novel foam-like network
structure of GR/PPy/CNF had been successfully
fabricated using a facile, low-cost, nontoxic, and environmentally
friendly in situ polymerization method. The GR reduced the charge
transfer resistance and increased the rate of electrochemical reactions
in the bulk PPy. Controlled addition of CNFs was carried out to improve
the electrochemical properties during the polymerization process.
The as-obtained GR/PPy/CNF possessed a unique foam-like network structure
with a high surface area. These promising results revealed that natural
CNFs were added to produce advanced materials with high capacitance
and good cycling performance in supercapacitor. As a result, the charge
storage was improved, rendering a high SC at high current densities.
