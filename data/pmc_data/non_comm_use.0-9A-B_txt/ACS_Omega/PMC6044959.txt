A method
based on in-syringe dispersive solid phase extraction
(IS-D-SPE) and ultra performance liquid chromatography Orbitrap high
resolution mass spectrometry for the multiresidue analysis of 117
pesticides in tea was developed. Full scan mode was acquired over
an m/z range of 100–800 with
Orbitrap resolution at 70000, followed by full scan/dd-MS2 mode for confirmation. The identification criteria of retention
time and mass accuracy tolerance was ±0.20 min and ±5.0
ppm, respectively. MS/MS fragment ions obtained dd-MS2 were
necessary to identify the pesticides with the same molecular mass
weight. The IS-D-SPE technique involved a mixture of 200 mg PSA, 100
mg C18, and 15 mg multiwalled carbon nanotubes for the cleanup of
tea matrix. Good linearity (R2 > 0.99)
for 117 pesticides was obtained. Satisfactory recoveries in the range
of 70–120% were obtained for 105 pesticides, while intraday
and interday precisions were below 20%. Limits of quantification were
generally 10 μg kg–1. Finally, this method
was employed to analyze 117 pesticides in 70 tea samples.

1 Introduction
Tea is the most widely
consumed beverage next to water in the world.
By drinking a cup of tea, one can take in plenty of special nutrient
substances, such as catechins, theanine, polysaccharide, vitamins,
and essential minerals. These substances are beneficial for human
health due to their effective medicinal and therapeutic potentialities,
such as cancer prevention, antioxidants, anticardiovascular diseases,
correcting skin disorder, and body weight reduction.1 Besides beneficial healthy function, the fascinating aroma
and comfortable taste attract people to enjoy tea, especially young
people.

Tea (Camellia sinensis L) is a perennial
woody plant and is grown in regions such as tropical, subtropical,
and temperature zones. These growth conditions are favorable for pests,
diseases, and competing grasses. In China, more than 800 pests and
diseases have been found in tea gardens, which results in serious
damage of tea yield and quality.2 Currently,
application of pesticide formulations is the most effective measure
to prevent pests and disease, and improve tea yield and quality. Regarding
the negative effects of the application of pesticides in tea, there
are potentially harmful residues. The presence of pesticide is an
important issue in tea safety and tea trade.3 Many countries and regions, such as Japan, European Union (EU),
China, and Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC), have formulated maximum
residue levels (MRLs) in tea. The strictest MRLs are set by the EU,
where 515 pesticide MRLs are regulated, and MRLs for unregulated pesticides
are set at 0.010 mg kg–1.4 Japan also has set up 264 pesticide MRLs and the unregulated pesticide
MRLs are at 0.01 mg kg–1.5 Chinese national standard has formulated 387 pesticide MRLs in agricultural
products, where 48 pesticide MRLs in tea have been regulated in the
range of 0.1–20 mg kg–1.6 Therefore, high throughput pesticide screening at trace
levels is necessary to ensure tea safety and reduce the tea economic
loss due to exceeding the pesticide MRLs.

Chromatography coupled
with mass spectrometry is widely used for
the screening and determination of pesticide residues in tea.7,8 Gas chromatography coupled with single mass spectrometry (GC-MS)
or tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) is employed for the analysis
of volatile and thermostable pesticides, while liquid chromatography
tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) is alternatively used to detect
the polar, nonvolatile, and thermally unstable pesticides.9 A high throughput GC-MS and HPLC-MS/MS method
for the multiresidue determination of 490 and 448 pesticides, respectively,
has been developed and validated by Pang et al.10 For GC-MS/MS and HPLC-MS/MS, several parameters, such as
the precursor and two MS/MS transitions, retention time, and the area
ratio between two MS/MS transitions, are required to be monitored.
However, false positive or negative findings for the MS/MS technique
may occur due to the use of nonspecific transitions, characterized
by a poorly resolved chromatographic peak.11 Other drawbacks and limitations for the MS/MS technique which are
inherent to targeted acquisition are as follows: time-consuming optimization
of MS/MS parameters, limited number of compounds in one instrumental
method, time-consuming and constant definition of acquisition-time
window, and nonretrospective data analysis.12 Although LC-MS/MS and GC-MS/MS employing triple-quadrupole MS systems
are traditionally used for multipesticide analysis, the use of high
resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) with full-scan technique has become
a promising analytical technique for the high throughput screening
and determination of organic pollutants in foods, the environment,
and other matrices.13,14 Compared with MS/MS, the HRMS
technique has several advantages that are important for screening
and identification of unknown compounds: higher sensitivity, higher
accurate mass for calculating elemental composition, and higher accurate
mass of product ions (MSn).15

The Orbitrap high resolution mass analyzer was first described
in 2000 and commercially introduced in 2005.16,17 In Orbitrap HRMS, the option for an internal mass calibration can
be chosen to correct all the scans in a LC-Orbitrap MS experiment.18 A mass accuracy greater than 5 ppm at resolving
power 60,000 fwhm (full-width at half-maximum peak height at m/z 400) can be achieved due to the use
of the Orbitrap mass analyzer preceded by an external injection device
based on trapping ions RF-only gas-filled curved quadrupole (named
C-trap).19 Due to accurate mass and high
sensitivity, the utility of HPLC-Orbitrap-MS is sufficient for the
measurement of a wide range of pesticides at trace residue in various
matrices, such as fruit and vegetables,20 honey,21 fish,22 and baby foods.23 Currently, there are
few literature references on this analytical technique for high throughput
screening pesticide residues in tea using HPLC Orbitrap MS. Until
now, only two studies related to high throughput screening pesticide
residues in green tea and its nutraceuticals employing HPLC Orbitrap
MS have been reported. One previous report focused on screening pesticide
residues in the nutraceutical products, such as tea powder and extracts.24 The tea nutraceuticals are generated from raw
tea leaves or manufactured tea and would have undergone complex processing.
The presence of matrix differences may result in different matrix
interference and method performance when HPLC Orbitrap MS is applied.
Another previous study focused on the UPLC-Q-Orbitrap MS identification
of pesticide residues in agricultural products, such as vegetables,
fruits, and green tea.25 Therefore, it
is necessary to establish a novel methodology for screening and determination
of multipesticide residues in tea using UPLC-Q-Orbitrap MS.

The purpose of this study was to develop a high throughput screening
and multi residue analysis of pesticides in various tea samples (green
tea, black tea, and oolong tea) using UPLC-Q-Orbitrap-MS. A rapid
and simple sample preparation employing in-syringe dispersive solid
phase extraction (IS-D-SPE) cleanup was optimized. Full scan/dd-MS2 monitoring mode was used for screening and identification
of targeted pesticides.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Chemicals and Reagents
All pesticides
were of certified quality and purchased from Dr. Ehrenstorfer (Augsburg,
Germany), Sigma–Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany), J&K Chemical
(Beijing, China). Full name, chemical formula, and accurate mass are
listed in Supporting Information Table-S1.
HPLC-grade acetonitrile, methanol, and acetone were provided from
Sigma–Aldrich (Merck, Germany). HPLC-MS grade formic acid and
ammonium acetate were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich. Deionized
water was obtained using a Milli-Q plus ultrapure water system from
Millipore (Miford, USA). The sorbents of primary second amine (PSA),
multiple walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), and octadecylsilane (C18)
were provided from Agela (Tianjin, China). Analytical-grade sodium
chloride and anhydrous magnesium were provided from Zhejiang Medicine
(Hangzhou, China), and baked for 3 h at 650 °C prior to use.

2.2 Samples
All tea samples (green tea,
black tea, and oolong tea) were obtained from Laboratory of Tea Safety
and Risk Assessment, Ministry of Agriculture, P.R. China. Organic
tea samples free of pesticides were used for matrix standard solution
and recovery test. Ten positive tea samples, which were previously
detected and confirmed using UPLC-MS/MS, were employed for the optimization
of the extraction procedure. All tea samples were stored in a dark
room at 1–4 °C.

2.3 Standard Solution Preparation
Individual
stock standard solutions (generally at 1000 μg mL–1) were prepared in methanol or dissolved in a few volumes of acetone
and then added to the scale of volumetric flask using methanol. Of
these stock solutions, standard mixture solutions were diluted at
5 μg mL–1 using methanol. Working standard
solutions were prepared by the serial dilution of standard mixture
solutions using methanol. Matrix matched standard solutions were prepared
by adding less than or equal to 100 μL of working standard solution
into about 900 μL of the blank extractions (total volume of
standard solution and blank extraction was equal to 1 mL), which were
obtained from organic tea samples and cleaned up by IS-D-SPE.

2.4 Sample Preparation
The proposed sample
preparation method was performed using acetonitrile extraction by
vortex and IS-D-SPE cleanup. Homogenized tea powder (2.5 g) was weighed
into a 50 mL centrifuged tube, and then 5 mL of deionized water was
added and mixed by a vortex at 1200 rpm for 1 min. Ten mL of acetonitrile
was added, followed by extraction using a vortex at 1200 rpm for 2
min. Afterward, 2 g of NaCl and 4 g of MgSO4 were added
and mixed by a vortex at 1200 rpm for 1 min, and followed by centrifugation
at 5000 rpm for 5 min. Two mL of upper layer extraction was transferred
into a syringe containing 200 mg PSA, 100 mg C18, and 15 mg MWCNTs.
After plugging the bottom, the syringe was blended using a vortex
at 1200 rpm for 1 min. Finally, the plug was changed with a 0.22 μm
filter membrane. The extraction was transferred into sample vial for
UPLC-Q-Orbitrap-MS analysis.

To determine the effect of water
immersion on extraction efficiency, the incurred samples were extracted
with acetonitrile with and without water immersion. Comparison of
different extraction methods, e.g., stand by for overnight, homogenizer,
vortex, and shanking device, were carried out for shortening extraction
time and streamlining sample preparation.

2.5 UPLC-Q-Orbitrap-MS
Parameters
UltiMate
3000 HPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,MA, USA) was used
for the separation of the analytes on the reverse phase Hypersil GOLD
C18 (100 mm × 2.1 mm i.d., 3 μm particle size, (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Waltham,MA, USA). The mobile phase consisted of
0.1% (v/v) formic acid and ammonium formate 4 mM in water (A) and
methanol (B). A gradient elution was applied as follows: 10% B, 0–1
min; 10–75% B, 1–3 min; 75–100% B, 3–4
min; 100% B, 4–10 min; 100–10% B, 10–11 min;
10% B, 11–14 min. The sample tray temperature, column oven
temperature, injection volume, and flow rate set at 20 °C, 30
°C, 10 μL, and 0.3 mL min–1, respectively.

The UPLC system was coupled with a Q-Orbitrap MS, a high-performance
benchtop quadrupole Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Waltham,MA, USA). Ionization was achieved by operating a heated electrospray
ionization (H-ESI) probe in the positive mode. The Orbitrap MS parameters
were as follows: sheath gas (N2, >99%), 35 mL; auxiliary
gas (N2, >99%), 10 mL; heater temperature, 350 °C;
capillary temperature, 300 °C; spray voltage, 4 kV; skimmer voltage,
18 V; capillary voltage, 35 V; tube lens voltage, 95 V. Quantification
and screening data were acquired using full scan and full scan/dd-MS2 mode, respectively. The full scan mode was acquired over
an m/z range of 100–800 with
Orbitrap resolution at 70000 full width at half-maximum (fwhm) at m/z = 200. Automatic gain control (AGC)
target ion set at 1.0e6 for a maximum injection
time of 100 ms. Stepped normalized collision energies (NCEs) were
set at 30, 50, 70 eV. The dd-MS2 resolution was set at
17500 fwhm (m/z = 200). The precursor
ions with a signal threshold >1.0e4 were
automatically performed for MS2 fragmentation activation
with 40% collision energy.

2.6 Data Processing
Data acquisition
and processing were performed using Tracefinder 3.3 software package.
Data calculations and statistical analysis were performed using Microsoft
Excel and SPSS 12.0, respectively. Accurate-mass database of protonated
molecular ion [M + H]+ or ammoniated molecular ion [M+NH4]+ and MS/MS fragment ions, and retention time
were obtained by injection of individual standard solutions at 500
ng mL–1. The defined criteria for identification
analysis was as follows: retention time ±0.20 min, mass accuracy
tolerance ±5.0 ppm, identical molecular ions, and MS/MS fragment
ions. The most abundant ion, typically the protonated molecular or
ammoniated molecular ion, was used for quantification.

2.7 Validation Procedure
Matrix effect
was evaluated by comparing the slopes of the analytical curves obtained
using matrix matched standards and solvent. Each analytical curve
was established at six different concentrations in the range of 1–200
μg L–1 (equal to 8–800 μg kg–1 for tea samples). Matrix effect is calculated as
follows:  The method was validated according to the
international SANTE guidelines SANTE/11945/2015.26 Representative matrices, including green tea (unfermented),
black tea (fermented), and oolong tea (semifermented), were used for
validation. Linearity was evaluated using matrix matched standard
solution in the range of 1–200 μg L–1 (equal to 4–800 μg kg–1 for tea sample).
Accuracy was measured in terms of recoveries obtained by five blank
samples fortified at 10 and 50 μg kg–1 of
the respective analytes. The lowest fortification level was chosen
based on the lowest maximum residue levels (MRLs) which were generally
set up at 10 μg kg–1. Precision was evaluated
as intraday and interday repeatability, expressed as relative standard
deviation (RSD). Limits of detection (LODs) were obtained by injecting
fortified samples at 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, and 10.0 μg kg–1. Limits of quantification (LOQs) were determined
by analyzing minimum fortified samples that provided suitable recovery
in the range of 70–130% and RSDs within 20%.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Establishment of Compound
Database for Qualification
and Quantification
To develop a database of target compounds,
individual standard solutions for 117 pesticides at 50 μg L–1 were injected into the UPLC-Q-Orbitrap-MS, and the
MS acquisition in positive was performed with and without fragmentation
in the HCD collision cell. Table S-1 shows
the accurate mass, retention time, and fragmented ions obtained from
full scan/dd-MS2 mode. Mutual interference was not observed
for 113 pesticides based on chromatographic retention time window
±0.2 min and mass error ±5 ppm. For full scan mode, the
compounds with the same mass (isomers) are hardly distinguished because
they have the same molecular mass weight. As shown in Figure 1, quinalphos and phoxim have
the same chemical formula C12H15N2O3PS with the theoretical mass m/z at 299.0613 Da (experimental mass at m/z 299.0607 Da), and the retention time deviation
was less than 0.1 min. In this case, dd-MS2 monitoring
mode is necessary for obtaining fragmented ions to identify quinalphos
and phoxim. In the HCD collision cell, the protonated molecular ion
[M + H]+ of quinalphos was fragmented into the product
ions at m/z 147.0550 and 163.0326,
while the fragmented product ions at m/z 129.0448 and 114.9609 were obtained from the phoxim protonated molecular
ion. Besides quinalphos and phoxim, the isomers pretilachlor and metolachlor
have the same accurate mass and similar retention time and different
fragmented ions of protonated molecular ion, which is shown in Figure S-1. Therefore, UPLC-Q-Orbitrap MS was
performed with full scan monitoring mode for identification and quantification,
and full scan/dd-MS2 was complementary for identification
of the compounds with the same chemical formula and molecular weight.

Figure 1 Extracted
ion chromatograms (m/z 299.0607
with exact mass error 5 ppm) (A1, B1), full
scan mass spectrogram (A2, B2), and
dd-MS2 fragmented ions (A3,B3) for
quinalphos (A) and phoxim (B) in standard solution at 50 μg
L–1.

In this study, interference from the tea matrix was investigated.
No interference from the matrices was found for any of the pesticides,
except allethrin, when retention time window set at 0.5 min. As shown
in Figure 2, three
chromatographic peaks (extracted ion m/z 303.1952) obtained from blank tea sample could result in the interference
with allethrin (mass error at 5 ppm). To evaluate retention time tolerance,
20 successive injections of a mixture of green tea matrix matched
calibration solution at 50 μg L–1 were carried
out. The results showed that retention time deviations for all pesticides
were less than 0.15 min. Therefore, the retention time window set
at 0.2 min in this study, and none of the 117 pesticides interfered
with the tea matrix.

3.2 Determination of Extraction Efficiency of
Pesticide Residues in Incurred Tea Samples Using Different Extraction
Techniques
In order to evaluate the extraction efficiency
of multi pesticide residues, we choose different types of pesticides,
which have a wide range of water solubility (0.48–39800 mg/L,
20 °C) and octanol–water ratio (Log Kow 0.8–6.37). The effect of extraction technique
on detected concentrations of 11 pesticide residues in 10 incurred
tea samples was investigated. First, the effect of the additional
water on extraction efficiency was investigated. Figure 3 illustrates that all detected
concentrations of 11 incurred pesticides increased, ranging from 1.1
to 18.6 times, when tea samples were allowed to be immersed in boiling
water prior to acetonitrile extraction, in comparison with the use
of acetonitrile as extraction solvent without soaking in boiling water.
The enhancement ratio seems negatively correlated with octanol–water
partition coefficient (Log Kow). Second,
the effect of soaking by boiling water and room-temperature water
on extraction efficiency was investigated. As shown in Table S-2, the detected concentrations obtained
from soaking in water (at 20–25 °C) (E5) were less than
3.6–14.9% of the average values obtained from six extraction
procedures. The results illustrated that boiling water was helpful
for acetonitrile to permeate tea leaves and improve extraction efficiency
of pesticides. Finally, different extraction techniques were compared
and the results were shown in Table S-2. Statistical analysis based on SPSS LSD test showed that there was
no significant difference of detected concentrations of 11 pesticides
in 10 incurred tea samples using five extraction techniques, e.g.,
standing overnight (about 12 h) (E1), vortexed for 2 min (E2), rotational
oscillation at 300 rpm for 10 min (E3) or 20 min (E4), and homogenization
with blend probe (E6). The results obtained from E6 were slightly
higher than from other extraction techniques. The extraction procedure
is one of the key points for high throughput sample preparation and
it requires simultaneous processing of multiple samples. For homogenization
with one blend probe, it is inconvenient, slow, laborious, and potentially
hazardous due to its extensive and problematic cleaning steps.27 For high throughput sample analysis, extraction
procedures E1 (stand by for overnight) and E3 (rotational oscillation
for 10 min) were proposed, while extraction procedures E2 and E3 were
suitable for quick sample preparation.

efficiency of 11 representative pesticides
(values of Log Kow are given in brackets)
in incurred tea samples with or without water soaking prior acetonitrile
extraction (n = 5).

3.3 Optimization of IS-D-SPE Cleanup Procedure
IS-D-SPE is a dispersive solid extraction (D-SPE) sample preparation
technique using a syringe containing adsorbents for cleanup, which
does not need centrifugation and therefore takes less time for sample
preparation.28−31 Several dispersive adsorbents (PSA, C18, GCB, SAX, florisil, carbon
nanotubes) have been previously reported for removal of tea matrix
as D-SPE adsorbents.8,32−38 In this study, PSA, C18, and MWCNTs were prepared for cleanup in
the mixture of IS-D-SPE adsorbents, and each mass of adsorbents was
optimized. To evaluate the recovery and cleanup effects, blank extracts
spiked with 117 pesticides at 25 μg L–1 were
investigated using different adsorbents. All pesticides could obtain
good recovery in the range of 90–110%, and the color density
of extracts had little change when PSA and C18 were individually used
as IS-D-SPE adsorbents with the amount of 0–200 mg, which indicated
that both adsorbents had little adsorption capacity of 117 pesticides,
as well as pigments or other color substances. MWCNTs, as a carbon-based
nanomaterial, has been reported as an excellent adsorbent for the
removal of agricultural sample matrix owing to the large surface area
and structural characteristics.39−41 Color density of tea extracts
became lighter when the mass of MWCNTs increased from 0 to 50 mg.
In consideration of the adsorptivity of MWCNTs for pesticides, mixture
adsorbents of 200 mg PSA, 100 mg C18, and MWCNTs with the mass of
0–50 mg were optimized. As shown in Figure 4, satisfactory recoveries in the range of
80–120% were obtained for 109 pesticides when 50 mg MWCNTs
was used. Eight pesticides (e.g., chlorbenzuron, clofentezine, diflufenican,
pendimethalin, phosmet, profenofos, rotenone, and spirodiclofen) seriously
lost their recovery with the MWCNTs cleanup treatment. By comparison,
15 mg of MWCNTs was proposed because higher recovery of chlorbenzuron,
clofentezinethe, and phosmet weas observed. Finally, a mixture of
200 mg PSA, 100 mg C18, and 15 mg MWCNTs was used as IS-D-SPE adsorbent.

Figure 4 Recovery
of 117 pesticides with 200 mg PSA, 100 mg C18, and different
amounts of MWCNTs for cleanup of the tea matrix.

3.4 Method Validation
The obtained data
of matrix effects are shown in Figure 5. Ion suppression with matrix effect value below 0
was observed for most analytical pesticides in black tea, green tea,
and oolong tea. Pesticides with significant matrix effect below −20%
from black tea, green tea, and oolong tea accounted for the percentage
of 11%, 21%, and 26%, respectively. Generally, matrix suppression
was stronger for unfermented tea (green tea) and semifermented tea
(oolong tea) than fermented tea (black tea). Eleven pesticides, e.g.,
carbendazim (51–70%), dichlorvos (22–90%), dimethoate
(20–30%), flonicamid (81–85%), methacrifos (22–36%),
monocrotophos (49–51%), sebuthylazine (27%), simetryn (54–55%),
spirotetramat (31–35%), thionphanate-methyl (43–66%),
and trichlorfon (41–52%), showed strong ion suppression below
−20%. Therefore, matrix matched calibration solutions were
employed to establish the calibrated curves for each pesticide. Good
linearity was achieved for all 117 pesticides with correlation coefficients
(R2) higher than 0.991 (see Table S-3).

Figure 5 Evaluation of matrix effect in black tea
(BT), green tea (GT),
and oolong tea (OT).

Accuracy was evaluated in terms of recovery at spiked levels
of
10 μg kg–1 (20 μg kg–1 for dimetachlone) and 50 μg kg–1, shown
in Table 1. Except
for 12 pesticides, e.g., chlorbenzuron (21–31%), chlorfluazuron
(61–71%), chlorotoluron (46–52%), clofentezine (22–34%),
diflubenzuron (40–57%), diflufenican (43–64%), fenazaquin
(49–61%), imazalil (49–68%), pendimethalin (33–48%),
spirodiclofen (50–58%), spirotetramat (52–61%), and
tricyclazole (42–53%), recoveries were in the range of 70–110%.
For different kinds of tea samples, there is little difference in
recovery among black tea, green tea, and oolong tea. Physicochemical
properties of analytical pesticides were responsible for the loss
of recovery, especially due to the adsorption of MWCNTs during IS-D-SPE
cleanup.

a Intraday precision, expressed as
RSD (%), is given in brackets (n = 5) and interday
precision (RSD %) was evaluated using spiked green tea samples at
50 μg kg–1 during 5 consecutive days.

b Fortification level at 20 μg
kg–1.

Precision was measured employing intraday repeatability and interday
reproducibility testing. Intraday repeatability was evaluated at the
fortified levels of 10 μg kg–1 and 50 μg
kg–1 during the same day. In this case, the repeatability,
expressed as RSDs, was less than 17% (see Table 1) for all analytical pesticides. Interday
reproducibility was evaluated analyzing five blank green tea samples
spiked with 50 μg kg–1 of 117 pesticides during
5 consecutive days. Interday RSDs for all analytical pesticides were
below 18%.

LODs were estimated analyzing three blank samples
spiked at 0.5,
1.0, 2.0, 5.0, and 10.0 μg kg–1. They are
defined as the minimum concentration at which the accurate mass error
was ±5 ppm,42 and LODs were less than
or equal to 5 μg kg–1 for all pesticides except
dimetachlone at 10 μg kg–1 (see Table S-3). According to accuracy and precision
measurement, LOQs were 10 μg kg–1 for 104
pesticides which provided recoveries between 70% and 130%, and RSDs
below 20%. LOQs of dimetachlone were 20 μg kg–1 due to poor sensitivity. Although low recoveries for 9 pesticides,
including chlorfluazuron, chlorotoluron, diflubenzuron, diflufenican,
fenazaquin, imazalil, spirodiclofen, spirotetramat, and tricyclazole,
were in the range of 40–70%, these pesticides could be quantified
using this method according to European Council No SANTE/11945/2015,26 where the document shows that a mean recovery
below 70% may be acceptable when the method is quite consistent (with
a good precision). Due to the low recovery below 40%, this method
was not suitable for quantification of chlorbenzuron, clofentezine,
and pendimethalin in tea.

3.5 Real Sample Analysis
A total of 70
tea samples (30 green tea samples, 20 black tea samples, and 20 oolong
tea samples) purchased from local markets in Zhejiang province were
analyzed using this proposed UPLC-Q-Orbitrap-MS method. For each batch
of less than 20 tea samples, quality control samples spiked with 117
pesticides at 10 and 50 μg kg–1 were analyzed
to evaluate the characteristics of the analytical method. Target analyte
identification was based on retention time window ±0.2 min and
mass accuracy ±5 ppm. To confirm positive samples, characteristic
fragments and isotopic pattern were monitored using UPLC-Q-Orbitrap-MS
in full scan/dd-MS2 mode. Table 2 shows the frequency and concentrations of
11 detected pesticides, including acetamiprid, buprofezin, carbaryl,
carbendazim, chlorpyrifos, difenoconazole, indoxacarb, imidacloprid,
myclobutail, pyridaben, and triazophos. Higher frequencies above 10%
occurred for two neonicotinoid pesticides (acetamiprid and imidacloprid),
buprofezin, carbedazim, and pyredaben. Multi residues containing over
3 pesticides in the same sample were observed for green tea (9.2%),
black tea (2.8%), and oolong tea (15.9%). Figure 6 shows an oolong tea containing actamiprid
(5 μg kg–1), chlorpyrifos (0.3 μg kg–1), imidacloprid (79 μg kg–1), and triazophos (0.1 μg kg–1). None of
the 117 pesticides was higher than EU maximum residue levels (MRLs),
CAC MRLs and China MRLs.

Figure 6 Extracted ion chromatograms of imidacloprid
(m/z 256.0596) at 79 μg kg–1, acetamiprid (m/z 223.0745) at
5 μg kg–1, triazophos (m/z 314.0725) at 0.1 μg kg–1, and
chlorpyrifos (m/z 349.9333) at 0.3
μg kg–1 detected in an oolong tea sample.
(note: Quantification by single point calibration using matrix matched
calibration solution at 1 μg L–1.)

4 Conclusions
A high throughput method based on in-syringe dispersive solid phase
extraction and UPLC-Q-Orbitrap MS was developed for rapid analysis
of multiple pesticide residues in green tea, black tea, and oolong
tea. A mixture of adsorbents containing PSA, C18, and MWCNTs was used
as IS-D-SPE adsorbents to reduce tea matrices. UPLC-Q-Orbitrap-MS
at full scan monitoring mode provided high method selectivity, accuracy,
and precision. Full mass/dd-MS2 monitoring mode is necessary
to identify the compounds with the same chemical formula. Matrix suppression
was more serious for unfermented tea and semifermented tea than fermented
tea. This newly developed method allows high sample preparation thanks
to its simplicity and effectiveness. Compared with previous analytical
methods, the advantages of this proposed method are less time-consuming,
solvent-consuming, lower cost, and higher throughout analysis. Therefore,
this method is suitable for routine analysis and identification of
multiple pesticides in various types of tea samples. This method was
applied to analyze 70 tea samples. High frequency of two neonicotinoid
pesticides acetamiprid and imidacloprid, buprofezin, carbendazim,
and pyredaben was found.
