Herein, a base-metal nickel-catalyzed
direct olefination of alcohols
with sulfones is reported. The reaction operates under low catalyst
loading and does not require an external redox reagent. A wide range
of trans-stilbenes and styrenes were synthesized
in good yields and selectivities. Biologically active stilbene DMU-212 could also be synthesized in a single step under these
conditions. Mechanistic studies involving kinetic isotope effect,
deuterium labeling experiments, and catalytic and stoichiometric reactions
with possible catalytic intermediates were performed to elucidate
a plausible mechanism.

1 Introduction
Olefins
or alkenes are one of the most important classes of organic
compounds with a wide range of applications.1 Many styrene derivatives displayed critical biological activities
such as resistance to cardiovascular and cancerous diseases.2 They also find use as sensors and in vivo imaging
agents.3 These compounds are also widely
used for sensitization, electroluminescence, and photochromism, as
well as in organic dyes.4 The importance
of this class of compounds can be easily illustrated by the number
of synthetic strategies that have been developed for their synthesis.
Among such methodologies, the leading one is carbonyl olefination
using various carbanions equipped with leaving functionalities,5 such as PR3 in Witting reaction,6 P(O)(OR)2 in Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons
reaction,7 SiR3 in Peterson
olefination,8 or SO2R in Julia
olefination.9 More effective strategies
like catalytic Heck reactions, Suzuki coupling,10 Tebbe olefination,11 olefin
metathesis,12 etc. are developed. However,
the need for prefunctionalized substrates and/or precious metals as
catalysts is their significant drawback.

For the last few decades,
acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling
of alcohols has developed as an attractive tool for synthesizing unsaturated
compounds. All of these reactions are not only atom-economic and environmentally
benign, but also redox-economic as an oxidation step is saved in the
process.13 These reactions were performed
by using highly toxic and costly noble-metal catalysts.14 Their replacement by more available base metals
is more sought after as they provide not only sustainability and economic
relief, but have also been found to show novel reactivity, which is
evident by the significant advances made in this field.15 In this aspect, nickel, which is one of the
abundant 3d metals, has been applied in many cross-coupling16 and photoredox catalysis.17 However, to date, nickel-catalyzed hydrogen autotransfer
or borrowing hydrogenation reaction to produce unsaturated compounds
remains underexplored.18

2 Results and Discussion
Proceeding on our quest of developing
sustainable and environmentally
friendly chemistry by using first-row transition metals,19 we speculated whether or not we could synthesize
olefins by olefinating alcohols with sulfones. Alcohols can be easily
obtained from various industrial sources or can be derived from many
sustainable precursors. Using alcohol, we had earlier reported an
olefination protocol of methyl-substituted heteroarenes catalyzed
by manganese.19a Although a wide variety
of olefins were efficiently synthesized by following this methodology,
the need of heteroarenes limited the scope to a certain aspect. In
this work, we chose a different path of synthesizing olefins using
readily available Julia olefinating reagent sulfones. Olefination
of alcohols with sulfones has been performed earlier by using homogeneous
ruthenium pincer complex20 and a heterogeneous
platinum catalyst21a in the presence of
excess amount of strong base (Scheme 1). The reaction has also been performed in the presence
of an excess base in the presence of alcohol itself as the solvent.21b Although this protocol provides a promising
aspect as a metal-free methodology, the use of excess alcohol as the
solvent does not provide the sustainability and can be pointed out
as one of the limitations of the said procedure. Herein, we report
on the direct olefination of alcohols in the presence of more accessible
nickel and diversely available nitrogen ligand. To the best of our
knowledge, a base-metal-catalyzed oxidant-free Julia olefination of
alcohols has not been reported thus far.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Olefins
We started our investigation
by taking (benzylsulfonyl)benzene 1a and benzyl alcohol 2a as the model substrate
(Table 1). To test
the efficacy of various Ni catalysts, various commercially available
ligands were tested with NiBr2 in the presence of KOH in
dioxane at 140 °C for 24 h. To our delight, 1,10-phenanthroline L1 gave the desired stilbene 3a in 85% yield
(entry 1). Changing the ligand to neocuproine L2 further
improved the efficiency (entry 2), and the desired product could be
isolated in 89% yield. Other nitrogen ligands (L3–L4) and several phosphine ligands (L5–L8) were also explored, but none of them could surpass the
efficacy of NiBr2/L2 system.

Table 1 Key Optimization Studiesa
a Reaction conditions: 1a (0.15 mmol), 2a (0.1 mmol), Ni salt (0.005 mmol), ligand
(0.006 mmol), and KOH (0.1 mmol) under argon atmosphere at 140 °C
in 1,4-dioxane (0.5 mL) for 24 h in a Schlenk tube. Yields were determined
by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) using
mesitylene as an internal standard (isolated yields are in parentheses).

Furthermore, other Ni(II) precursors
were found to be less efficient
(entries 9–11). The influence and scope of solvents, bases,
and base loading were also examined, and it did not improve the reaction
efficiency (see Supporting Information (SI) for details). The control experiment demonstrated that only 12%
of 3a was formed in the absence of NiBr2/L2 system.

Under these optimized conditions, we explored
the scope of this
protocol. Initially, various primary alcohols were tested (Table 2) and we were delighted
to find that the efficiency of NiBr2/L2 in
the prototype system could also be expanded to various alcohols. Importantly,
the reaction tolerates a number of halo-substituted benzyl alcohols 2e–h delivering the desired stilbenes
with yields up to 72% with the retention of the halo-functionalities
and thus leaving room for further functionalization. Alcohols with
electron-rich (2b) and electron-withdrawing (2i) substituents also responded well to the optimized conditions delivering
the stilbenes in satisfactory yields. Naphthyl (2j) and
heteroaromatic alcohols 2k–l were
also explored. The pyridyl and thiophenyl groups, which have the potential
of binding with the nickel center and thereby poisoning it, were also
found to be viable for the olefination reaction delivering the product
in 83 and 54% yields, respectively.

Various other sulfones 1b–i could
also be utilized as the olefinating agent (Table 3). When a series of halo-substituted benzyl
sulfones 1b–d were employed in the
nickel-catalyzed olefination reaction, the desired stilbenes were
isolated in up to 81% yield with the complete retention of the halogen
functionality. Similarly, electron rich 4-OMe (1e)-,
4-Me (1f)-, 4-Ph (1g)-, and 2-naphthyl (1h)-substituted sulfones also responded well to the reaction
conditions, giving the desired olefins in 52–73% yields and
complete E-selectivities.

The protocol
could also be extended for the synthesis of styrenes
using (methylsulfonyl)benzene 1i as the olefinating agent
(entries 14–20, Table 3). Thus, primary alcohols 2b–m containing various electronically biased groups, halogens, and naphthyl
and thiophenyl functional groups were treated with 1i under standard conditions. Gratifyingly, the desired functionalized
styrenes (3q–w) were obtained in
45–68% yields. Note that the undesired α-mehtylstyrenes,
which were observed as a byproduct (up to 1:8 ratio) in the previous
ruthenium-catalyzed process, were not observed in the present reaction
conditions.20

The developed protocol
was further applied for the preparation
of DMU-212, which inhibits tumor growth and also found
to show anticarcinogenic activities.22 The
treatment of the alcohol 2n with the sulfone 1e under the standard reaction condition delivered DMU-212 in 76% isolated yield with complete E-selectivity
(Scheme 2). Note that DMU-212 could quantitatively be deprotected in the presence
of BBr3 to yield resveratrol,23 which displays antioxidant, anticancer, anti-inflammatory,
and other biological activities (Scheme 2).24

Scheme 2 Synthesis
of DMU-212 and Resveratrol
Next, to get an insight into the mechanistic
pathway involved in
the olefination reaction, a series of controlled experiments were
carried out. At the onset, we hypothesized that a multistep catalytic
process is involved in this nickel-catalyzed olefination reaction
(Scheme 3). More specifically,
the involvement of a dehydrogenation/hydrogenation cascade process
(hydrogen autotransfer) and a base-mediated elimination of sulfinate
for the generation of the olefins is proposed. During the control
experiments, we observed that the product did not form in the absence
of a base. We envisioned that the base not only involves in the elimination
step, but also activates the nickel precatalyst via dehalogenation.
The formation of the byproduct PhSO2K was confirmed by
its isolation (72%) and characterization by 1H NMR and
HRMS analyses (see the SI), and thus it
provides the opportunity of reusability. Further, the aldehyde intermediate
could be detected when the reaction was conducted without 1a (see the SI).

Scheme 3 Proposed Reaction
Mechanism
Then, we did some
deuterium labeling experiments to shed light
on the mechanism involved in the reaction (Scheme 4). The olefination of [α,α-D2]biphenyl methanol 2c-d2 (94% D) with 1f was studied under
standard reaction condition, and the analysis of the product distribution
using 1H NMR revealed 78% D incorporation (83% retention)
at the α-position along with 17% D incorporation at the β-position
(Scheme 4a). Then,
a parallel experiment of 2c and 2c-d2 with 1f was performed to perceive
about the kinetic isotope effect (KIE). The observed product ratio
based on 1H NMR analysis pointed out kH/kD = 3.1. This indicated
that the dehydrogenation of the alcohol took place at or before the
rate-determining step. The treatment of 4-((phenylsulfonyl)methyl-D2)-1,1′-biphenyl 1g-d2 (82% D) with 2d, on the other
hand, gave 3p in 74% yield without deuterium incorporation
(Scheme 4b), and KIE
= 1 is in agreement with the operation of fast base-mediated Aldol
condensation reaction.

Scheme 4 Mechanistic Experiments
The intermediacy of a nickel hydride species
was then probed. An
attempt to synthesize the hydride from NiBr2/L2 was unsuccessful using several hydride donors. A similar nickel
hydride was found to be unstable and could not be detected at −75
°C.18c Conveniently, a Ni–H
species L6–Ni–H was independently prepared using an electron-rich phosphine (L6).25 Importantly, the catalytic
reaction using L6–Ni–H (5 mol %) proceeded at a similar efficiency to the NiBr2/L6 system (Scheme 4c). Further, the intermediate vinyl sulfone 4a was independently prepared and reacted with 2a under standard reaction condition using L6–Ni–H as a catalyst to prove the intermediacy
of Ni–H species, a vinyl sulfone 4, and the involvement
of alcohol as the hydride source (Scheme 4d). This delivered 3a in 85%
yield. Again, a similar reaction of the vinyl sulfone 4b with 2c-d2 (94% D) was
performed under standard reaction condition (Scheme 4e). 1H NMR analysis of the product
(63% yield) revealed 62 and 14% D deuterium incorporation at the α-
and β-positions, respectively. These results clearly indicated
the intermediacy of a nickel hydride and vinyl sulfone 4 species and hydrogenation of 4 during the reaction,
where the alcohol acts as the generic hydride source.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, direct olefination of primary
alcohols with Julia
olefinating agent was performed under mild reaction condition without
the addition of an external reducing agent as the alcohol acts as
the source of both the aldehyde and the hydride. A complex of a base
metal nickel with an inexpensive commercially available nitrogen ligand
catalyzed the reaction. A wide range of olefins were successfully
synthesized with perfect (E) selectivity. The use
of earth-abundant metals as catalyst can provide sustainability and
potentially replace rare noble metals in homogeneous catalysis. We
hope that this report provides a step further toward the evolution
of sustainable and environmentally benign chemistry.

4.1 General Considerations
The reactions have been conducted
under argon atmosphere in oven-dried glassware. Temperatures for the
reactions have been reported as the temperature of the oil bath that
surrounds the reaction tube. For drying of solvents, standard procedures
were followed. For recording 1H, 13C NMR spectra,
Bruker (1H: 500 MHz, 13C {1H}1: 126 MHz) and JEOL (1H: 400 MHz, 13C {1H}: 101 MHz) were used, and the referencing is according
to the solvent residual resonance. Multiplicities have been indicated
as: br for broad, s for singlet, d for doublet, t for triplet, or
m for multiplet. Coupling constants (J) are reported
in hertz (Hz). Mass spectra have been recorded on Bruker micrOTOF-Q
II Spectrometer.

Alkyl sulfones were
prepared according to the previous report.26

4.3 Optimization Studies (Table 1, Tables S1–S7)
Base (0–100 mol %) and catalyst (0–5 mol
%) were
taken in a Schlenk tube (15 mL) and solvent (0.5 mL) was added. Then, 2a (0.1 mmol) followed by 1a (0.15 mmol) was
added, and the tube was closed. It was aged at 140 °C under Ar
for the specified time. After that, GC yield was measured by using
mesitylene as the standard.

4.4 General Procedure of Substituted
Stilbene Synthesis
KOH (5.6 mg, 0.1 mmol), NiBr2 (1.1 mg, 0.005 mmol), and
neocuproine (1.3 mg, 0.006 mmol) were taken along with 1,4-dioxane
(0.5 mL) in a Schlenk tube (15 mL). Then, 1 (0.15 mmol)
followed by 2 (0.1 mmol) was added and the tube was closed.
It was aged at 140 °C under Ar for 24 h. After quenching the
reaction with water (2 mL) and ethyl acetate (3 × 10 mL) extraction,
it was dried over Na2SO4 and purified by column
chromatography.

4.5 General Procedure of Substituted
Styrene Synthesis
KOH (5.6 mg, 0.1 mmol), NiBr2 (1.1 mg, 0.005 mmol), and
neocuproine (1.3 mg, 0.006 mmol) were taken along with 1,4-dioxane
(0.5 mL) in a Schlenk tube (15 mL). Then, methyl phenyl sulfone 1i (0.15 mmol) followed by alcohol (0.1 mmol) was added and
the tube was closed. It was aged at 140 °C under Ar for 24 h.
Mesitylene (0.1 mmol) and CDCl3 (0.5 mL) were then added,
and the mixture was filtered through a small plug of silica. NMR spectra
were measured directly from the clear solution of the filtrate to
