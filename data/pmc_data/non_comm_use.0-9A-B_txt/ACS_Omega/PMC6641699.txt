Heterojunction nanorods having dissimilar
semiconductors possess
charge transfer (CT) properties and are proposed as active elements
in optoelectronic systems. Herein, we describe the synthetic methodologies
for controlling the charge carrier recombination dynamics in CdSe–CdTe
heterojunction nanorods through the precise growth of CdTe segment
from one of the tips of CdSe nanorods. The location of heterojunction
was established through a point-by-point collection of the energy-dispersive
X-ray spectra using scanning transmission electron microscopy. The
possibilities of the growth of CdTe from both the tips of CdSe nanorods
and the overcoating of CdTe over CdSe segment were also ruled out.
The CT emission in the heterojunction nanorods originates through
an interfacial excitonic recombination and was further tuned to the
near-infrared region by varying the two parameters: the aspect ratio
of CdSe and the length of CdTe segment. These aspects are evidenced
from the emission lifetime and the femtosecond transient absorption
studies.

Introduction
Heterojunction nanostructures
obtained by integrating a semiconductor
with another semiconductor display novel functional properties that
are fundamentally different from their individual components.1−3 For example, the photoluminescence lifetimes in the heterojunction
nanostructures having a staggered band alignment (often called as
type II systems) are found to be longer due to the lower degree of
overlap between the electron and hole wavefunctions.2,4,5 Photoexcitation in type II semiconductor
systems essentially leads to a spatial separation of charge carriers
across the interface, making the exciton loosely bound.2,6,7 This unique property qualifies
semiconductor heterojunction nanostructures as one of the most promising
candidates for photovoltaic applications.8−12 However, effective extraction of electrons and holes
is not possible in type II semiconductors having core–shell
architectures because one of the charge carriers is trapped in the
core.6,13 Indeed, it is possible to overcome such
situations by designing one-dimensional heterojunction nanorods having
two dissimilar semiconductors (denoted as S1 and S2). The synthesis
of such systems having a well-defined interface is challenging: various
approaches reported include (i) S2 linked on to the growing tip of
S1 (S1–S2),1,2,14 (ii)
S2 linked on both the tips of S1 (S2–S1–S2),15−17 and (iii) S2 incorporated in the one-dimensional structures of S1,18−20 forming nanoplatelets21−23 and nanobarbells.24,25

An ideal type II heterostructure displays unique absorption
and
emission spectral features originating from the charge-separated state.2 Theoretical investigations of the CdSe–CdTe
heterojunction nanorods have been carried out independently by two
groups using the local density approximation: (i) Wang and Wang determined
the exciton dissociation dynamics, binding energy, and radiative decay
time of charge transfer (CT) excitons in these systems26 and (ii) Ribeiro et al. reported the band structure
of nanostructures and their band offset at the interface.27 These theoretical investigations are extremely
useful for designing type II heterojunction nanorods with well-defined
properties. In a classic work, Scholes and co-workers first demonstrated
the design of CdSe–CdTe heterojunction nanorods, which possess
two excitonic emission bands, and further investigated their physical
properties.1,2,4,28,29 The long-wavelength
emission band corresponds to an interfacial charge transfer state.
The second emission band, blue shifted from the CT emission, stems
from the direct excitonic recombination in the CdTe segment.19 The excitons generated through the former process
are localized in two segments and hence are loosely bound compared
with the latter. The loosely bound excitons in the heterojunction
nanostructures are long-lived, which makes the charge carrier extraction
more efficient than in the tightly bound excitons.30,31 One of the essential requirements for the efficient design of photovoltaic
devices is to identify semiconductor nanostructures that generate
long-lived electron–hole pairs. However, the potential of these
systems has not been explored may be due to the synthetic difficulties
involved in the design of heterojunction nanorods possessing charge
transfer states. Also, literature lacks correlative investigations
on the dimensions of the semiconductor segments, which can solely
produce a charge transfer state. Herein, we report an optimal synthetic
procedure for the design of heterojunction nanorods possessing well-defined
segments of CdSe and CdTe, which exclusively yield tunable charge
transfer emission.

Results and Discussion
To achieve
the above objective, we designed the CdSe–CdTe
heterojunction nanorods with a tunable charge transfer emission and
compared their properties with CdSe nanorods. Design of the former
was achieved by varying the molar equivalents of the precursors (Cd:Se:Te)
and the reaction time. Precise locations of CdSe and CdTe segments
as well as the heterojunction were established through a point-by-point
elemental mapping and correlation of their photophysical properties
with their dimensions.

Synthesis of CdSe Nanorods
CdSe
nanorods having two
different aspect ratios were synthesized and details are provided
in Materials and Methods. They are designated
as CdSe(L) and CdSe(H), representing the lower
and higher aspect ratios, respectively. Details of characterization
are presented as the Supporting Information. It is clear from the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
(HR-TEM) images that the nanorods are highly crystalline in nature
(Figures 1, S1C, and S2C). The aspect ratios of CdSe(L) and CdSe(H) nanorods are estimated as 1.66 (length
of ≈5.0 nm and width of ≈3.0 nm) and 2.49 (length of
≈10.2 nm and width of ≈4.1 nm), respectively (Figures S1D,E and S2D,E). The first excitonic
band of CdSe(L) and CdSe(H) are centered at
559 and 626 nm, respectively, and the corresponding emission maxima
were observed at 571 and 635 nm, respectively (Figures S1A and S2A). Highly symmetrical emission spectrum
and absence of any band at the long-wavelength region indicate that
the emission originates from the direct excitonic recombination rather
than from the trap states. The narrow emission, with full width at
half-maximum of ≈30 nm, also indicates that CdSe nanorods are
highly monodispersed. The variation in the reactivity of different
crystal faces forms the basis of the preferential growth of CdTe segment
from one of the tips of CdSe. It is reported that the anisotropic
growth of the nanocrystal nuclei prefers to be in the wurtzite lattice
structure.32,33 The X-ray diffraction patterns
of CdSe used for growing CdTe possess a wurtzite structure (Figures S1B and S2B) and details are listed below.

Figure 1 HR-TEM
image of (A) CdSe(H) and (B) CdSe(H)–CdTe
(Te 10) nanorods. Both CdSe(H) and CdSe(H)–CdTe
(Te 10) nanorods were allowed to grow for 10
and 5 min, respectively, after the addition of the corresponding precursors
(details are provided in Materials and Methods).

Growth of CdSe–CdTe
Heterojunction Nanorods
The (001) facets of CdSe nanorods
with a wurtzite structure involve
alternating Se and Cd layers. As a result, cadmium atoms of the (001̅)
face are relatively
unsaturated
with three dangling bonds per atom, which forms the growing face.
In contrast, the opposite (001) face of the c axis
exposes relatively saturated Cd atoms having one dangling bond per
atom. Another factor responsible for the preferential growth is the
lower coordination of ligands along the c axis compared
with the stable lateral facets. It is reported that the phosphonic
acid ligands bind to the lateral nonpolar facets of the wurtzite structure
than the basal polar facets.32 Thus, (i)
the higher energy of (001̅) face due to the presence of unsaturated
bonds and (ii) the lower coordination ability of the ligands on these
polar facets drive the preferential growth of the nanorods along the c axis. The syntheses of CdSe–CdTe nanorods are carried
out by the sequential injection of Se and Te precursors into the reaction
pot containing Cd2+ ligand complex as mentioned in Table 1. The resultant heterojunction
nanorods obtained from CdSe(L) and CdSe(H) are
denoted as CdSe(L)–CdTe and CdSe(H)–CdTe,
respectively.

a Heterojunction nanorods grown along
the c axis of CdSe having a lower aspect ratio (X
= L) and a higher aspect ratio (X = H).

First, CdSe nanorods are synthesized by injecting
Se precursor
(0.45 molar equiv) to the reaction pot having excess Cd precursor
(1 molar equiv). Further, the growth of CdTe segment is achieved by
varying the two factors: (i) concentrations of Te precursor (0.05–0.30
molar equiv; Table 1) and (ii) reaction time. Maintaining the temperature at 280 °C,
Te precursor (Te–trioctylphosphine (TOP) solution) is quickly
injected to the above solution. The growth of CdTe segment along the c axis of CdSe nanorods is followed as a function of time
by withdrawing the aliquots. The concentration of Te precursor is
systematically varied (0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, and 0.30 molar equiv)
and the obtained heterojunction nanorods are labeled as indicated
in the last column of Table 1. The samples are precipitated from methanol and purified
by washing with a mixture (1:1) of methanol and acetone to remove
the unreacted precursors and the excess ligands by centrifugation.

In the case of CdSe(L)–CdTe (Te 5) nanorods,
the excitonic band at 559 nm, corresponding to CdSe(L) segment,
is found to be more or less unaffected (Figure 2A) in the absorption spectrum. The growth
of CdTe segment results in an increase in the absorption cross section
in the near-infrared (NIR) region, suggesting the formation of a charge
transfer (CT) state.2,24 This NIR absorption can also
have a minor contribution from CdTe segment. Interestingly, the emission
spectrum of these systems showed a discrete CT emission in the NIR
region with broad spectral features. However, the emission bands corresponding
to CdSe as well as CdTe segments are absent in these systems. It is
well established in organic systems that the recombination of electron–hole
pair in donor–acceptor systems results in the CT emission.34 With time, the emission maximum of the CT band
of CdSe(L)–CdTe (Te 5) shifts to a longer wavelength
(traces (ii) and (iii) of Figure 2), indicating the growth of CdTe segment. The CdTe
segment is allowed to grow for 5 min and a small aliquot of the product
is withdrawn and purified. The emission spectra are recorded by exciting
the samples at 450 nm, keeping both the excitation and emission slit
width as 2 nm. Similar results are observed when these experiments
are repeated by injecting 0.10 molar equiv of Te precursor to CdSe(L) (labeled as CdSe(L)–CdTe (Te 10)). The
CT emission shifts to the NIR region with increasing time indicate
a progressive growth of the CdTe segment on CdSe(L) nanorods.
The CT emission shifts to lower energies as the energy difference
between the CdSe conduction band and the CdTe valence band decreases
(Figure S3). Further increasing the concentration
of Te precursor (0.15–0.30 molar equiv) yields heterojunction
nanorods having two emission bands similar to that reported by Scholes
and co-workers: (i) a CT band in the NIR region and (ii) a higher
energy band corresponding to the direct recombination of the exciton
in CdTe segment. The absorption and emission spectra of the heterojunction
nanorods formed on adding 0.15 molar equiv of Te precursor to CdSe(L) nanorods is presented as traces (ii) and (iii) in Figure 2C,D, respectively.
The bands corresponding to the emission from CdTe and CT emission
from the heterojunction are observed at 640 and 775 nm, respectively,
which further are shifted to 663 and 800 nm when allowed to grow for
10 min.

CdSe(L) nanorods (black trace) and (ii, iii) CdSe(L)–CdTe heterojunction nanorods obtained by growing CdTe along
the c axis by varying time: (ii) 5 min (red trace)
and (iii) 10 min (blue trace). CdSe(L) nanorods are synthesized
by injecting Se precursor (0.45 molar equiv) to Cd precursor (1 molar
equiv) and arresting the reaction after 5 min. Further CdSe(L)–CdTe heterojunction nanorods are synthesized by adding Te
precursor to the above reaction mixture after 5 min: (A, B) 0.05 molar
equiv and (C, D) 0.15 molar equiv (designated as CdSe(L)–CdTe (Te 5) and CdSe(L)–CdTe (Te 15), respectively).
The absorption spectra are normalized at the corresponding first excitonic
band of CdSe and the emission spectra are normalized at the emission
maximum.

Excitation spectrum of CdSe(L)–CdTe (Te 15),
followed at the charge transfer emission maximum (775 nm), is compared
with the normalized absorption spectrum of CdSe and the corresponding
heterojunction nanorod (Figure S4). The
features of the excitation spectrum of the heterojunction nanorods
match well with those of the corresponding absorption spectrum. These
results together with the lifetime studies (vide infra) indicate that
the CT emission originates through the excitonic recombination across
the interface. To generalize the design strategy, attempts are made
to grow CdTe segments on the reactive tip of CdSe(H). Three
independent experiments are being carried out by adding 0.10, 0.20,
and 0.30 molar equiv of Te precursors to a solution containing CdSe(H) nanorods. CdTe segments are grown on CdSe
nanorods for 5 min and the reaction is arrested by decreasing the
temperature. The samples are purified as mentioned earlier. Heterojunctions
of CdSe(L)–CdTe and CdSe(H)–CdTe
are characterized using various analytical (Supporting Information) and microscopic techniques.

Microscopic
Characterization of Heterojunctions
It
is clear from the HR-TEM images that the length of CdSe nanorods increases
on injection of Te precursors (Figures 1, S2D, and S5B). Attempts
are made to locate the heterojunction by estimating the d-spacing values along the c axis of the nanorods
(Figure S6). However, it is difficult to
conclusively locate the interface because the lattice mismatch (7.1%)
and the difference in the d-spacing values along
the c axis plane for CdSe (0.35 nm) and CdTe (0.37
nm) are small.35,36 However, a distinct difference
in d-spacing is observed on moving along the longitudinal
axis of the heterojunction, which rules out the possibility of overcoating
CdTe over CdSe nanorods. Further attempts are being made to identify
the heterojunction of CdSe–CdTe nanorods by carrying out the
elemental analysis along its c axis using energy-dispersive
X-ray (EDX) analysis. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)
mode of TEM (≈0.2 nm beam) is used to carry out these studies
using the aberration-corrected Titan (FEI) electron microscope, operated
at 300 kV. It is found that severe damage occurred for nanorods (Figure S7) upon prolonged exposure to electron
beam during elemental mapping through line scan acquisition method.
Hence, the EDX measurements are restricted to a point-by-point analysis.

The heterojunction nanorods and their interface are further characterized
using scanning transmission electron microscopy high-angle annular
dark-field (STEM-HAADF) analysis. In the present case, the contrast
between CdSe and CdTe is not high enough to differentiate the materials
due to the small difference in atomic number between Se and Te in
the HAADF technique. Hence, we performed EDX measurements at specific
locations, and these results are presented in Figure 3A. From the STEM-HAADF images, two CdSe(L)–CdTe nanorods are selected and the EDX analysis
is performed at two different locations (labeled as 1–4). In
all of the locations, we observe a spectral line corresponding to
the energy 3.13 keV, which is attributed to the Cd Lα. This
result indicates that cadmium is present throughout the nanorod. The
EDX spectrum collected from one end (Figure 3A; EDX 1) of the heterojunction nanorod in
the STEM image showed a spectral line at 1.37 keV corresponding to
Se Lα. The other end of same heterojunction nanorod (Figure 3A; EDX 2) shows a
spectral line at 3.76 keV corresponding to Te Lα. The spectral
peaks corresponding to Te and Se are not observed in positions 1 and
2, respectively. Similar results are observed for the second nanorod
(Figure 3A; EDX 3 and
4). These results conclusively indicate that the nanorods are made
up of two dissimilar semiconductors, with one end as CdSe and the
other end as CdTe. However, on the basis of the above studies, we
could not locate the heterojunction in the nanorods. Hence, similar
set of experiments is performed on a single nanorod by collecting
the EDX spectra, from one end to the other, in closely spaced locations
(Figure 3B). The EDX
spectra collected from four locations are presented (Figure 3B, labeled as EDX 1–4)
and three important observations are gathered. The spectral lines
corresponding to (i) Cd is observed in all of the positions, (ii)
Se is observed at positions 2–4, and (iii) Te is observed at
positions 1 and 2.

Figure 3 (A) High-resolution HAADF-STEM images of two CdSe(L)–CdTe (Te 10) heterojunction nanorods and the EDX
analysis
carried out at their terminal positions, marked as EDX 1–4.
The spectral lines corresponding to various elements, measured from
the marked positions using EDX analysis, are presented. (B) Elemental
analysis performed at closely spaced locations from one end to the
other, on a single nanorod, by collecting the EDX spectra. The location
2 is identified as heterojunction wherein the signals from both Se
and Te are observed.

These studies show the presence of Se and Te at position
2, indicating
the location of the heterojunction from where CdTe starts to grow
on addition of Te precursor. The absence of Te signals at positions
3 and 4 rules out the possibility of the growth of CdTe along the
lateral facets. The width remained more or less unchanged, indicating
the preferential growth of the nanorods along the c axis. Thus, other possibilities such as (i) the growth of CdTe from
both the tips of CdSe nanorods and (ii) overcoating of CdTe over CdSe
nanorods are ruled out. Further, we investigated the STEM-HAADF imaging
and the EDX analysis of CdSe(H)–CdTe (Te 30) heterojunction
nanorods synthesized by using higher molar equivalents of Te precursor.
A significant growth of CdTe segment occurred at a higher concentration
of Te precursor with a bending of the nanorods. The EDX analysis is
performed at six closely spaced locations (Figure 4; positions 1–6) along CdSe(H)–CdTe (Te 30) nanorod. The EDX spectra showed the characteristic
lines corresponding to Cd and Se at positions 1 and 2 (EDX 1 and 2).
Interestingly, at position 3, Te line was also observed along with
Cd and Se lines, indicating the formation of a heterojunction (EDX
3).

Figure 4 HAADF-STEM images of CdSe(H)–CdTe (Te 30) heterojunction
nanorods and the EDX analysis carried out at closely spaced locations,
from one end to the other, on a single nanorod. The location 3 is
identified as a heterojunction wherein the signals from both Se and
Te are observed and bending of the nanorods is observed as a result
of the strain encountered during the growth of CdTe segment due to
lattice mismatch.

The EDX analysis performed
at positions 4–6 exhibit spectral
lines corresponding to Cd and Te (EDX 4–6), indicating the
growth of CdTe segment from position 2. On increasing the length of
CdTe segment, a curvature is observed at the heterojunction of the
nanorods as evidenced in Figure 4. Bending of the nanorods is attributed to the strain
encountered during the growth of CdTe segment due to lattice mismatch.37 Strain-induced bending has been earlier reported
in CdSe nanorods overcoated with CdTe. In this case, deposition of
a few monolayers of CdTe is observed on the lateral faces of CdSe
with a faster growth at the tips.38 Further
deposition of CdTe results in the bending of the nanorods. In the
present case, bending occurs on increasing the length of CdTe and
growth occurs only from one of the tips of CdSe nanorod.

Photophysical
Characterization of Heterojunction Nanorods
After establishing
the presence of heterojunction, we further investigated
their photophysical properties by varying the length of CdTe segment
on CdSe(L) and CdSe(H). The absorption and emission
spectra of CdSe(L)–CdTe and CdSe(H)–CdTe
synthesized by varying Te precursor concentrations are presented in Figure 5A,B as a stacked
plot (Figure S8, for corresponding plots
in three-dimensional format). It is evident from the figure that the
volume ratio of CdSe and CdTe segments has a major influence on their
optical properties.

Figure 5 (A, C) Absorption and (B, D) emission spectra of CdSe(L) and CdSe(H) nanorods and the corresponding heterojunction
nanorods in chloroform. Heterojunction nanorods are obtained by adding
varying amounts of Te precursor to (A, B) CdSe(L) and (C,
D) CdSe(H) nanorods. The CdTe segments are allowed to grow
for 5 min after the addition of Te precursor. The emission spectra are recorded
by exciting the solution at 450 nm and by keeping both the excitation
and emission slit width as 2 nm.

The CdSe(L)–CdTe heterojunction nanorods
possess
only charge transfer emission when the molar equivalents of Te precursor
are maintained at ≤0.10. Based on these results and TEM studies,
it is clear that when the length of CdTe segment is maintained below
4 nm in the heterojunction nanorod (CdSe(L) segment: length
≈5.0 nm; width ≈3.0 nm), the emission originates through
an excitonic recombination at the interface. On further increasing
the concentration of Te precursor above 0.15 molar equiv, a new emission
band is observed at the high-energy region, originating through the
direct recombination of exciton in CdTe segment. The absorption and
the emission spectra of CdSe(H) and CdSe(H)–CdTe
nanorods are presented in Figure 5C,D (also see Figure S8).
Two excitonic emission bands are observed when the growth of CdTe
segment exceeds 7 nm, and these aspects are obvious from Figure 5. Following observations
are drawn based on the aspect ratio-dependent studies: (i) CT emission
originates through the excitonic recombination at the interface at
lower concentrations of Te precursor, irrespective of the aspect ratio
of CdSe segment; and (ii) a new emission band corresponding
to CdTe is observed along with CT emission at higher Te precursor
concentrations which is also independent of the aspect ratio of CdSe.
Thus, it is concluded that the length of CdTe segment influences the
emission properties of these heterojunction nanorods rather than the
aspect ratio of CdSe. This is due to the fact that valence and conduction
bands of CdTe possess higher energies than those of CdSe and hence
the holes will quickly migrate to CdTe segment. As a result, emission
corresponding to the CdSe segment is not observed in heterojunction
nanorods.

The emission lifetime of CdSe(L) and various
CdSe(L)–CdTe heterojunction nanorods is estimated
using
time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) measurements. The fitted
decay traces along with residual plots are presented in Figure S9. The charge transfer emission observed
from the heterojunction nanorods is found to be long-lived. For example,
the average lifetime (τ) of CdSe(L) and CdSe(L)–CdTe (Te 5) heterojunction nanorods is estimated
as 23 and 136 ns, respectively, which is further enhanced to 178 ns
on increasing the length of CdTe segment to 4 nm (denoted as CdSe(L)–CdTe (Te 10)). In the heterojunction nanorods, the
electron and hole wavefunctions are located in CdSe and CdTe segments,
respectively, and hence possess a lower degree of overlap, making
the exciton loosely bound. This effect is more predominant when CdTe
segment is longer because the transferred electron becomes more delocalized.
A significant growth of CdTe segment is observed when a higher concentration
of Te precursor is used (0.15, 0.20, and 0.30 molar equiv). Two excitonic
emission bands are observed from these nanorods and emission decay
of both the bands are followed. The τavg of the charge
transfer band remained more or less unaffected (∼176 ns) in
all of the cases. However, the emission emerging as a result of the
excitonic recombination in CdTe possesses a much lower lifetime (τavg ∼ 22 ns; details are provided as Table S1). Thus, the longer lifetime for the charge transfer
emission is attributed to the reduced overlap between the hole and
electron wavefunctions resulting from the slow recombination of excitons
across the heterojunction.

Femtosecond transient absorption
studies of CdSe(L) and
CdSe(L)–CdTe heterojunction nanorods (excited at
400 nm using mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser; Supporting Information) provided information about the dynamics of exciton
decay across the interface. Chirp-corrected transient absorption spectra
of both the nanorods possess bleach corresponding to the excitonic
bands (Figure S10). It is well established
that the bleach recovery at the excitonic band position results from
the depopulation of the state-filled electrons, which can provide
information about various electron relaxation pathways.39 The absorption–time profile of CdSe (trace
(i) in Figure 6B and Table S2) in the time window of 500 ps showed
a significant recovery, indicating that the state-filled electrons
undergo fast relaxation. When investigated under identical experimental
conditions, the relaxation of the state-filled electrons is substantially
slower on increasing the length of CdTe segment. These results further
indicate a lower degree of overlap of the electron and hole wavefunctions,
delocalized in the two segments of heterojunction nanorods. Dooley
et al. have earlier reported the charge transfer dynamics in CdSe–CdTe
heterojunction nanorods by selectively exciting CdTe. The interfacial
interconduction band electron transfer from CdTe to CdSe occurs on
500 fs time scale, followed by the formation of a charge transfer
band.19 However, in a more recent report,
Scholes and co-workers reported the bleaching of CdSe as well as CdTe
electronic transitions by pumping of CdSe–CdTe nanoplatelets
at CdTe absorption wavelength. This is due to the delocalization of
electrons over the entire conduction band of CdSe and CdTe as a result
of the quasi-type II band alignment.40 Steady-state
and time-resolved emission studies presented herein demonstrate that
heterojunction nanorods having smaller segments of CdTe possess a
well-defined CT emission, originating from the recombination of excitons
at the interface. It is easy to extract electrons/holes from such loosely bound excitons
in the heterojunction nanorods, thus making the rods useful as active
components in photovoltaic devices.

Conclusions
The synthetic methodology
presented here by varying molar equivalents
of (Cd:Se:Te) precursors is useful for designing CdSe–CdTe
heterojunction nanorods having well-defined segments of CdSe and CdTe.
These studies clearly indicate that the length of CdTe segment plays
a significant role in controlling the CT band. Design of heterojunction
nanorods having an exclusive charge transfer emission has been achieved
by maintaining the ratio of the length of the CdTe to CdSe segments
below 0.8. The charge transfer emission in these systems originates
from the recombination of excitons at the interface. The structures
of semiconductor segments and the heterojunction are conclusively
established using dark-field scanning electron microscopic studies
along with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Absence of Te signal
from the segment corresponding to CdSe confirms that the growth of
CdTe occurs preferentially along the c axis rather
than the lateral facets. The heterojunction nanorods reported herein
possess a tunable charge transfer state and are devoid of any direct
exciton formation. It is easy to extract electrons/holes from these systems, making them
useful as active components in photovoltaic devices.

Materials and
Methods
Synthesis of CdSe(L) and CdSe(H) Nanorods
Cadmium selenide nanorods are synthesized by following high-temperature
synthesis (>310 °C) reported by Scholes and co-workers1 with modifications. In brief, CdO (63 mg) dissolved
in a mixture of tetradecylphosphonic acid (275 mg) and trioctylphosphine
oxide (885 mg) is evacuated in a three-necked round-bottom flask kept
at 80 °C for 2 h. The mixture is then heated to 310 °C under
nitrogen atmosphere. After obtaining a clear solution, the temperature
is reduced to 300 °C and TOP–Se solution (17.5 mg of Se
in 0.75 mL TOP) is injected rapidly. The desired aspect ratio of CdSe
nanorods is obtained by adjusting the reaction time. CdSe(L) and CdSe(H) nanorods are obtained by increasing the reaction
time to 5 and 10 min, respectively. The reaction is arrested by decreasing
the temperature. The quantum rods are purified by precipitating with
a mixture (1:4) of methanol and acetone, followed by centrifugation.
The obtained nanorods are redispersed in CHCl3 (spectroscopic
grade) and used for further studies.

Synthesis of CdSe–CdTe
Heterojunction Nanorods
Heterojunction nanorods are synthesized
by injecting TOP–Te
to the above reaction mixture at 280 °C, before purification,
and allowing the CdTe segment to grow for 5 min. Variation in CdTe
length is carried out by increasing the molar equivalents of (Cd:Se:Te)
as given in Table 1. The growth of heteronanorods is arrested by decreasing the reaction
temperature. The nanorods obtained in all of the cases are purified
by repeated precipitation and washing with a mixture (1:4) of methanol and acetone.
