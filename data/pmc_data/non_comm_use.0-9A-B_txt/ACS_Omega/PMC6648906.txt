Second-order
nonlinear optics (NLO) is the foundation of frequency conversion for
the generation of coherent light at frequencies where lasers have
no emissions or operate poorly. The prerequisite for NLO materials
is noncentrosymmetric symmetry that can generate an effectively non-counterbalanced
spontaneous electronic polarization. Here, we propose that this material
restriction can be broadened by controlling the electron distribution
with a local internal electrostatic field (IEF), and we demonstrate
artificially created and manipulated second harmonic generation (SHG)
in a centrosymmetric optical material, a superimposed Co2+- and Mo6+-doped BiVO4 thin film with 2/m point group symmetry, where a homojunction producing tunable
effective polarization is formed. The SHG was characterized and tuned
by IEF. This work breaks the structural symmetry constraint on NLO
materials. Besides, the phase-matching-like condition was realized
for the further improvement of the efficient frequency conversion.
Because polarization is also a prerequisite for many other functions
besides SHG, we believe that this work should provide some inspiration
for the further development of optoelectronic, photonic, and electronic
materials.

1 Introduction
Since
the discovery of second harmonic generation (SHG) in 1961 in
an α-SiO2 crystal, second-order nonlinear optics
(NLO) has been considered to be a fundamental process in classical
and quantum optics for optical frequency conversion, which allows
the emission of coherent light in the wavelength range from soft X-ray
to terahertz radiation1−7 that are unavailable
or suffer from poor operation by direct lasing.8−10 In the microscopic
view, the intensity of
the second-order NLO emission is determined by the second power of
induced polarization (which generally depends on spontaneous polarization)
of component groups in NLO materials,11−14 whereas in the macroscopic
view, the second-order nonlinear coefficients for evaluating the NLO
effect form third-order tensors, which should obey the structural
symmetry of the nonlinear optical material, on the basis of the Neumann
principle.15,16 No matter which view, a second-order
NLO
material should have noncentrosymmetric (NCS) symmetry, in which the
contribution of the total spontaneous polarization is not eliminated,
and the third-order tensors are nonzero. Therefore, an NCS structure,
either intrinsic or artificial, is a prerequisite for the selection
of second-order NLO materials. Restricted by this prerequisite, many
relevant second-order NLO techniques have been realized and developed
in the NCS materials system, including bulk crystals [e.g., KBBF (KBe2BO3F), KTP (KTiOPO4), KDP (KH2PO4), ZGP (ZnGeP2), and AGS (AgGaS2)], boundaries (e.g., silicon and domain walls), and low-dimensional
materials (e.g., asymmetric quantum wells, asymmetric waveguides,
and even atomic layer materials).7,17−28 Meanwhile, some theoretical methods,
such as anionic group theory, the anharmonic motion model, and first-principles
simulations, have been proposed to guide the design of NLO materials
and to calculate the SHG coefficients.14,16,29

In fact, light frequencies near the visible
region are on the order of hundreds of terahertz, and the second-order
NLO processes can be considered to be a perturbation to the electronic
polarization.30 This implies that a second-order
NLO process is independent of the material symmetry if the electrons
can be successfully manipulated by an applied electric field.14,16 Note that the applied electric field must be very large because
the atomic field that binds electrons to ions is extremely strong
(∼108 V/cm).31 To satisfy
this condition, one possibility is to apply a giant external electric
field directly to the material, as proposed in 1962.30 The polarization required for NLO effects can be generated
by the giant external electric field based on the analysis of the
Curie principle,32 which concerns the symmetrical
relationship between applied external fields and physical properties,
as demonstrated in some gas and organic materials.33−35 However, to
generate effective electronic
polarization, applied electric fields are required with an intensity
on the order of 104–6 V/cm33−35 at the same
level as or even higher than
the saturation field and breakdown voltage of most solid materials.36,37 In this work, we propose to apply an internal electrostatic field
(IEF) by equilibrating Fermi energy levels in a homo- or heterojunction,
as suggested by observations that electrons can be driven and polarized
efficiently. Using this method, the electric field magnitude is varied
by tuning the Fermi energy levels of the contacted materials up to
several electron volts, values that are comparable with the ground
state energy of the hydrogen atom and sufficient to perturb the atomic
field.31 Consequently, the manipulation
of electrons with an IEF appears to be a promising way for realizing
second-order NLO. Using this concept, we have successfully obtained
effective phase-matched SHG output in a centrosymmetric optical material,
a superimposed Co2+- and Mo6+-doped bismuth
vanadate (BiVO4) thin film.

2 Results
2.1 Characterization of BiVO4 Samples
Monoclinic
BiVO4 is an n-type semiconductor exhibiting 2/m point symmetry and with a band gap of about 2.4 eV. The first-principles
formation energy calculations (shown in the Supporting Information) reveal that, when doping, Co2+ ions
are most likely to occupy the Bi3+ positions in the regular
BiVO4 lattice and act as hole donors, in agreement with
the previous results.38−43 Also, the Mo6+ ions occupy V5+ sites and introduce
a shadow electron donor level to the BiVO4 band structure.38−43 Three kinds of doped BiVO4 thin
films, namely, Co:BiVO4, Mo:BiVO4, and superimposed
Mo:BiVO4/Co:BiVO4 samples, were prepared with
a simple spin-coating method following a subsequent annealing process.
In a typical run, the precursor solutions were initially coated on
precleaned fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates using a spin
coater at a spin rate of 1000 rpm for 6 s. Then, a superimposed doped
layer was added for coupling to the doped sample. The doping concentrations
of Mo6+ and Co2+ are 3 and 6 at. %, respectively,
because an optimal Mo concentration at about 3% has been broadly proofed.38 More detailed information on sample synthesis
is given in the Supporting Information. The Fermi energy levels of Co:BiVO4 and Mo:BiVO4 are different, which builds an IEF by equilibrating the Fermi
energy levels when the homojunctions are formed.39−43

The morphology of the thin films was characterized
by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4800). As shown in
the SEM image, porous structures consisting of quite uniform particles
with a size of about 100 nm were observed on the surface of the Mo6+-doped BiVO4 films (Figure 1a). The particle size was inhomogeneous at
about 50–200 nm in Co2+-doped BiVO4 films
(Figure 1b). The Mo:BiVO4/Co:BiVO4 film shows porous structures with nonuniform
particles (Figure 1c). The cross-sectional SEM image (Figure 1d) of a typical Mo:BiVO4/Co:BiVO4 sample shows that the thickness of the Mo:BiVO4/Co:BiVO4 layer is about 400 nm.

image of typical 3% Mo:BiVO4/6%Co:BiVO4 sample.

The structure of
the thin films was studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) with an X-ray
diffractometer using Cu Kα irradiation (λ = 1.54 Å).
The results are shown in Figure 2a. In this figure, all the samples show (101) and (004)
peaks that are clearly observed with diffraction peaks at 19.1 and
29.2°, and the predominant orientation is (004) (crystallographic c-direction). The powder XRD patterns (Figure S1) of either Co:BiVO4 or Mo:BiVO4 are also consistent with that of pure BiVO4, indicating
that the doping of Co2+ or Mo6+ does not change
the centrosymmetric crystal structure of BiVO4. Singly
doped BiVO4 and coupling doped BiVO4 were compared
to determine the amount of template matching. These peaks are consistent
with the standard diffraction database indexed to monoclinic phase
BiVO4.

2.2 SHG Effects
of Co:BiVO4/Mo:BiVO4 Thin Films
We
first investigated SHG at different excitation wavelengths at
room temperature with a high-sensitivity fluorescence spectrometer,
and the results are shown in Figure S2.
Under excitation at 800, 1064, 1301, and 1502 nm, significant SHG
peaks at 400, 532, 651, and 751 nm are clearly observed in the Co:BiVO4/Mo:BiVO4 sample. Such broad SHG signals exclude
the possibility of SHG by interband or intraband transitions, which
was previously observed in quantum wells.20,21 It
should be emphasized that there are no SHG signals observed for the
Co:BiVO4 or Mo:BiVO4 samples. This result rules
out a surface effect formed between the Co:BiVO4 or the
Mo:BiVO4 layers and the atmosphere as the mechanism for
SHG production. Namely, the SHG signal comes directly from the Co:BiVO4/Mo:BiVO4 interface because the BiVO4 structure is centrosymmetric.

To further study the SHG effects
in Co:BiVO4/Mo:BiVO4 thin films, a nanosecond
pulse laser was used at a center wavelength of 1064 nm with a repetition
rate of 20 Hz and a pulse width of 20 ns. The excitation beam was
linearly polarized, and the initial polarization orientation was perpendicular
to the Mo:BiVO4/Co:BiVO4 thin film (θ
= 0) and parallel to the IEF formed by the homojunction. As illustrated
in Figure S3, a half-wave plate was placed
beyond the exciting laser, and a polarization analyzer was arranged
to control the change of θ from 0 to 180° with steps of
20°. During the experiments, we rotated the half-wave plate,
which is equivalent to rotating the sample polarization orientation.
The relative intensity of the SHG peak as a function of θ is
depicted in Figure 2b, with an excitation energy (J) of 0.5 mJ. Meanwhile,
we found that only the superimposed Co2+- and Mo6+-doped BiVO4 thin films possess high SHG relative intensity,
and there is no signal for Co:BiVO4 and Mo:BiVO4 thin films. This result indicates that an IEF is only produced by
the homojunction formed between Mo:BiVO4 and Co:BiVO4 and thus manipulates the electrons to generate the polarization
required for SHG. For reference, the noise signals with Co:BiVO4 and Mo:BiVO4 thin films are also presented in Figure 2b.

Although
the ionic positions in the Mo:BiVO4/Co:BiVO4 homojunction almost obey the symmetry of point group 2/m, the electrons are polarized along the z-axis by
the internal electric field that is intrinsically present at the interface,
thus breaking centrosymmetry. By analyzing the homojunctions, we conclude
that the symmetry of the homojunction should have only a twofold axis
perpendicular to the thin film. On the basis of the theoretical analysis
of the relationship between the nonlinear polarization and the applied
IEF, it can be concluded that the nonlinear polarization is in phase
with the electric field30 and that the
second-order polarization intensity is proportional to the second-order
nonlinear susceptibility tensor coefficient χin as
in16 1  where 1 = x, 2 = y, 3 = z, 4 = yz = zy, 5 = xz = zx, and 6
= xy = yx. For thin film, χ14 = χ23 = E3 =
0, so 2  

Thus, the generated SHG signal I is proportional
to the effective second-order nonlinear susceptibility tensor coefficient
χin as: 3  

With the above equation, the
SHG peak intensities at different polarization orientations can be
deduced, and the red line in Figure 2c is the fit to the experimental data with a relative
value of χ16/χ22 = 1.88 using this
equation. With the goal of estimating the second-order nonlinear susceptibility
of the Mo:BiVO4/Co:BiVO4 thin film, the SHG
of KDP crystal powder was also performed for comparison under the
same experimental conditions (J = 0.5 mJ). The comparison
is shown in Figure 2d. From this figure, one finds that the SHG signal of the Mo:BiVO4/Co:BiVO4 thin film at θ = 0 is about 1.1
times that of KDP powder, which has a nonlinear coefficient χ36 (KDP) = 0.39 pm/V. Therefore, we estimate the nonlinear
coefficients of the Mo:BiVO4/Co:BiVO4 thin film
to be χ16 = 1.05χ36 (KDP) and χ22 = 0.56χ36 (KDP). In addition, we investigated
the dependence of SHG intensity on fundamental radiation energy at
1064 nm (Figure 3a).
Clearly, the SHG signal increases quadratically with excitation energy,
in agreement with the SHG theory. It is proof that the SHG originates
from electron polarization in the Mo:BiVO4/Co:BiVO4 homojunction.

equation. (b) Mott–Schottky plots collected at a frequency

homojunction formed and the process of equilibrating Fermi energy
levels.

2.3 Calculation
of the IEF and Spontaneous Polarization Intensity
With the
doping strategy employed, the doped Mo6+ into
the V5+ site of BiVO4 strengthens the n-type
characteristics by supplying additional free electrons, resulting
in an increase in the electric conductivity of BiVO4. Acting
as a hole donor, doping of Co2+ (substitution on Bi3+ site) strengthens the p-type characteristics in the BiVO4 lattice and reduces the carrier concentration. Therefore,
a homojunction was formed between Mo:BiVO4 and Co:BiVO4 thin films, which gave rise to the distortion of Fermi level
toward the conduction band minimum and valence band maximum. As a
consequence, an IEF would be formed. To explore the IEF and electron
activity in the homojunction area, a photoelectrochemical measurement
was performed to determine the doped densities (Nd) of the Co2+- and Mo6+-doped BiVO4 thin film. The measurements were performed in a 0.1 M potassium
phosphate electrolyte (pH = 7) using a three-electrode electrochemical
cell configuration, using the prepared sample as the working electrode,
a Pt sheet as the counter electrode, and a saturated calomel electrode
as the reference electrode. In the case of an n-type semiconductor,
the Mott–Schottky relationship is given by the following equation44,45 4  where C is the interfacial capacitance, e0 is
the electron charge, ε and ε0 are the dielectric
constant of BiVO4 and the permittivity
of vacuum, respectively, and V is the applied voltage.
A plot of 1/C2 against V is shown in Figure 3b. From the slope of 1/C2–V curves, the value of Nd was
found to be Nd (Mo) = 2.56 × 1020 cm–3 and Nd (Co) = 4.05 × 1019 cm–3. As diagrammed
in Figure 3c, the Fermi
energy of Mo6+-doped BiVO4 is closer to the
conduction band than that of Co2+-doped BiVO4. When a single-element-doped BiVO4 layer comes into contact
with another layer, the electrons are transferred from the Fermi level
of Mo:BiVO4 into the lower part, and the holes are transferred
from the Fermi level of Co:BiVO4 into the upper part. As
a result, band bending is induced at the interface of the homojunction,
and the Fermi energy is equilibrated at a middle value. The amount
of band bending is given by the following equation38 5  where ΔEF, Co:BiVO4 and ΔEF, Mo:BiVO4 are the Fermi energy of Co-doped
and Mo-doped BiVO4, respectively, k is
the Boltzmann’s constant, and T is the absolute
temperature. On the basis of the donor density calculated above, the
difference in Fermi levels leads to a total potential drop of 48 mV.
In addition, when Mo-doped and Co-doped BiVO4 layers come
into contact, a space charge region (SCR) is simultaneously formed,
and the width can be estimated using the following equation:46 6  

Using this relation,
the width
of the SCR was calculated to be 3.18 nm. The maximum value of the
IEF (Emax) is found to be 301 kV/cm from . For the spontaneous
polarization intensity (Ps) caused by
the IEF, Ps = εε0Emax was used to estimate a value of Ps = 1.81 μC/cm2, which is comparable
with that of KDP in the ferroelectric phase (2–5 μC/cm2), and approximately one order of magnitude smaller than those
of KTP (20 μC/cm2) and BaTiO3 (25μC/cm2), which are well-studied commercial nonlinear optical crystals.47−49

2.4 First-Principles Calculations and Characterizations
of the IEF
To further confirm the existence of the IEF, first-principles
calculations on the Mo:BiVO4 and Co:BiVO4 systems
were performed. For the simulation models, the doping concentration
of Co was set at 6.25%, which is comparable with the experimental
concentration of ∼6%. The optimized geometries show that Mo6+ and Co2+ atoms substitute into the V5+ and Bi3+ sites in BiVO4, respectively, and
keep the coordination environment unchanged. The electronic structures
of Mo:BiVO4 and Co:BiVO4 exhibit acceptor-type
and donor-type semiconductor characteristics, respectively (Figure S4). As the Mo- and Co-doped films are
joined together to form a homojunction (Figure 4a), the Fermi level decreases in the former
and increases in the latter because of band bending (for the calculated
Fermi levels for doped BiVO4 and comparison with a perfect
BiVO4 film, see Figures S5–S7), which produces an IEF across the interface. The calculated charge
density map (Figure 4b) shows that the electrons are redistributed at the interface, indicating
the establishment of a local IEF because of the Fermi level difference.
The corresponding electronic potential profile (Figure 4c) reveals that, at positions far away from
the interface, the electrostatic potential exhibits a periodic variation
that follows the lattice period. However, the electrostatic potential
shows abrupt changes at the interface, which can be attributed to
the strong interaction between the two types of semiconductor.

by the orange vertical line.

To further investigate the influence of electrostatic field
on atomic
positions, we studied the lattice of Co:BiVO4/Mo:BiVO4 interfaces with a spherical aberration corrected scanning
transmission electron microscope (STEM, FEI Titan G2 80-200 ChemiSTEM).
By scanning the Mo:BiVO4/Co:BiVO4 interface,
we found that the lattice remained periodic and was not obviously
disrupted by the IEF. The typical images are shown in Figure S8. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) (Figure S9) was further performed
to investigate the chemical states of Mo:BiVO4, Co:BiVO4, and Mo:BiVO4/Co:BiVO4. All the Bi
4f and V 2p XPS peaks can be clearly observed without any shift on
binding energies, which further confirms that the doping of Mo6+ and Co2+ does not change the lattice structure
and coordination environment of BiVO4.

2.5 Tuning of SHG Intensity
Because the SHG effect is dependent
on the IEF, which is tunable
by controlling the doping concentrations, we fabricated 4% Co:BiVO4/3% Mo:BiVO4 and 8% Co:BiVO4/3% Mo:BiVO4 thin film samples. On the basis of the Mott–Schottky
measurement (Figure S10) and using eqs 1 and 2, we calculated the width of the SCR in 4% Co:BiVO4/3%
Mo:BiVO4 and 8% Co:BiVO4/3% Mo:BiVO4 thin films to be 4.81 and 1.06 nm, respectively. These values correspond
to maximum IEFs of 263 and 264 kV/cm, respectively, which induce respective
polarization of 1.57 and 1.59 μC/cm2. The SHG signals
generated under the same conditions are shown in Figure 5a, which indicates that for
4% Co:BiVO4/3% Mo:BiVO4, 6% Co:BiVO4/3% Mo:BiVO4, and 8% Co:BiVO4/3% Mo:BiVO4 thin films, the ratio of SHG intensity is 0.86:1:0.88 and
the ratio of the nonlinear coefficients is 0.7:1:0.8. The results
in Figure 5a indicate
that the nonlinear coefficients can be tuned by artificial polarization
fields created by the IEF, by considering the maximum value and width
of SCR in the homojunctions.

SHG signal comparisons among different
superimposed thin films with Co-doped concentration of 4, 6, and 8%
BiVO4 and Mo-doped concentration of 3% BiVO4. (b) Relative SHG intensity fitted with quadratic equation under
different numbers of interface n.

On the basis of previous results
and condition of the polarization direction formed by the local IEF
along the c-direction (004) (Supporting Information), we fabricated the superimposed Co2+- and Mo6+-doped BiVO4 thin films with
periods ranging from 1 to 9 shown in the schematic diagram in Figure S11. The relative frequency doubled light
intensity (I) with number of interfaces n ranging from 1 to 17 are presented in Figure 5b. By fitting the theoretical quadratic relationship
between the relative frequency doubled light intensity I and the effective length l to I ∝ l2 = n2p2, we find that the theoretical
and experimental results agree well with each other, indicating that
the frequency doubling process can be phase-matched. Here, p is the width of the SCR, 3.18 nm. It should be noted that
the good fit of the SHG signals from all the samples also demonstrates
that the SHG signal is generated by the local IEF, because the sample
with only one period has a different thickness from the others and
the IEF has no influence on the structure of BiVO4 systems.
It is proposed that an analogous process as shown above may be realized
at other fundamental wavelengths by suitably controlling the orientation
of the thin film.

3 Conclusions
This
discovery not only promises to be a good
method for extending the range of alternative materials but also reflects
a breakthrough in second-order NLO and nanometer optics, especially
for efficient SHG by the phase-matching-like condition. Because the
polarization is directly related to many nonlinear properties, such
as piezoelectricity, ferroelectricity, pyroelectricity, and so forth,
the spontaneous polarization caused by an IEF provides a novel approach
to the development of NLO in the future.

In summary, with the
creation of an IEF in a homojunction, SHG was achieved in a Co:BiVO4/Mo:BiVO4 thin film, a centrosymmetric optical
material. Broadband SHG was produced with fundamental wavelengths
ranging from 800 to 1501 nm. The symmetry of the SHG effect was analyzed
and found to possess a twofold axis. The nonlinear second-order susceptibility
tensor coefficients were tuned and measured and are comparable with
the nonlinear coefficients of KDP. By producing an IEF at the interfaces,
phase-matching for efficient SHG was demonstrated. We believe that
this work will open the door for artificially created NLO based on
the IEF and should present inspiration for further development of
piezoelectricity, ferroelectricity, and pyroelectricity, in which
polarization is also a primary factor.

4 Materials
and Methods
4.1 Syntheses
Commercial FTO-coated glass
with
about 50 nm thick FTO layer (Pilkington Co.) was employed as the substrate
with a thickness of 3 mm and a diameter of 1.5 cm. It was ultrasonically
cleaned in ethanol (99.0%, Aldrich) for 10 min, rinsed with distilled
water, and dried before the BiVO4 deposition process. Precursor
mixing solutions of 0.2 M Bi(NO3)3·5H2O in glacial acetic acid (0.2 M, 0.9 mL) and vanadyl acetylacetonate
(C10H14O5V, 0.03 M, 5.82 mL) in acetylacetone
with a Bi3+ and V5+ stoichiometric ratio of
1:1 were obtained by ultrasonication (power, 1.4 kW) for 20 min at
room temperature. For the Mo6+- or Co2+-doped
BiVO4, molybdenyl acetylacetonate (C10H16MoO6) and cobalt acetylacetonate (C10H14CoO4) were dissolved in acetylacetone (C5H8O2) separately and then interfused
with the precursor solutions containing Bi3+ and V5+. A spin coater coated the mixtures on reserved FTO substrates
for four layers at a spin rate of 1000 rpm for 6 s. To ensure uniformity
and stability of the doped BiVO4 thin films, they were
then dried in air at 150 °C for 10 min and calcined at 470 °C
for 30 min per layer. For the superimposed doped BiVO4,
the Mo:BiVO4 mixed solution (380 μL) was first coated
on an FTO substrate using the aforementioned procedure, and then,
the Co-BiVO4 mixed solution was spin-coated over the Mo:BiVO4 layer. For the superimposed Co2+- and Mo6+-doped BiVO4 thin films with various numbers of interfaces,
one Mo:BiVO4 layer was coated on the FTO substrate, and
then, the Co:BiVO4 mixed solution was spin-coated over
the Mo:BiVO4 layer to form one period. Subsequent periods
were fabricated using the same spin coating procedure.

4.2 First-Principles Calculations
To simulate the doped
BiVO4 films and homojunction structures,
a large supercell (BiVO4)16 of dimensions 5.096
× 5.097 × 42.661 Å was built. A vacuum thickness of
15 Å was added to avoid interaction between the film and its
image produced by the periodicity. According to symmetry analysis,
this model belongs to the P2 space group, so it possesses
a twofold rotation axis along the z-direction, which
is consistent with experimental measurements. Geometry optimizations
were performed by the CASTEP package,50 with ultrasoft pseudopotentials51 and
GGA-PBE functionals.52,53 A plane wave basis with an energy
cutoff of 600 eV was used in our calculations. The convergence thresholds
between optimization cycles for energy change and maximum force were
set to 5.0 × 10–6 eV per atom and 0.03 eV/Å,
respectively. Monkhorst–Pack grids of 2 × 1 × 1 k-points were used for the (001) surface of BiVO4.54 On the basis of the optimized structures,
the Fermi energy, electron potential, and electron density of BiVO4, Mo-doped BiVO4, Co-doped BiVO4, and
Mo:BiVO4/Co:BiVO4 were calculated. The doping
concentrations of Mo and Co were set at 1/16 (∼6.25%), which
is comparable with the experimental doping concentrations (6%).
