Density functional theory-based computations are carried
out to analyze the electronic structure and stability of B2(MIC)2 complexes, where MIC is a mesoionic carbene, viz.,
imidazolin-4-ylidenes, pyrazolin-4-ylidene, 1,2,3-triazol-5-ylidene,
tetrazol-5-ylidene, and isoxazol-4-ylidene. The structure, stability,
and the nature of bonding of these complexes are further compared
to those of the previously reported B2(NHC)2 and B2(cAAC)2. A thorough bonding analysis
via natural bond order, molecular orbital, and energy decomposition
analyses (EDA) in combination with natural orbital for chemical valence
(NOCV) reveals that MICs are suitable ligands to stabilize B2 species in its (3)1∑g+ excited
state, resulting in an effective B–B bond order of 3. Their
high dissociation energy and endergonicity at 298 K for the dissociations
L–BB–L → 2 B–L and L–BB–L
→ BB + 2 L (L = Ligand) indicate their viability at ambient
condition. The donor property of MICs is comparable to that of NHCMe. The orbital interaction plays a greater role than the coulombic
interaction in forming the B–L bonds. The EDA-NOCV results
show that the sum of the orbital energies associated with the (+,
+) and (+, −) L→[B2]←L σ-donations
is far larger than that of L←[B2]→L π-back
donation. It also reveals that cAACMe possesses the largest
σ-donation and π-back donation abilities among the studied
ligands, and the σ-donation and π-back donation abilities
of MICs are comparable to those of NHCMe. Therefore, the
present study shows that MICs would also be an excellent choice as
ligands to experimentally realize new compounds having a strong B–B
triple bond.

Introduction
In
the first row of the periodic table, carbon and nitrogen are
the only two candidates which were thought to form homoatomic triple
bonds (e.g., RC≡CR, N≡N) until 2002 when Zhou et al.1 detected OC–B≡B–CO possessing
a very short B–B bond with a bond distance of 1.453 Å
and a high B–B bond dissociation energy (143.5 kcal/mol) via
low-temperature matrix isolation technique. The B–B bond in
OCBBCO is found to be much stronger and shorter than the B–B
double bond in H–B=B–H (1.507 Å and 113.0
kcal/mol, respectively).1,2 These observations led
the authors to conclude about the presence of some degree of triple-bond
character in OCBBCO. Subsequently, some theoretical works showed that
there is remarkable B–B triple bond character in L→BB←L
type of complexes, where, L = monoatomic noble gases (Ar, Kr), diatomic
molecules (CO, CS, N2, BO–), and phosphine
derivatives (PCl3, PMe3).3−6 In 2011, Frenking and co-workers
reported in silico that the B2 molecule can be stabilized
in a linear fashion in NHC→B2←NHC complex
(NHC = N-heterocyclic carbene).7 In this complex, the B2 fragment is in third
excited (3)1∑g+ state having valence electronic configuration
(2σg)2(1πu)4, making the formal bond order of 3 (see Scheme 1). Next year, Braunschweig synthesized bottolable
NHCDipp→B2←NHCDipp (Dipp
= 2,6-diisopropyl-phenyl) complex.8 The
B–B bond length is found to be 1.449(3) Å by X-ray crystallography,
which agrees well with the B–B triple bond length 1.46 Å
as predicted by Pyykkö.9 In 2014,
cAACDipp→B2←cAACDipp complex (cAAC = cyclic alkyl amino carbenes) was synthesized with
a slightly larger B≡B bond distance of 1.489 Å.10 The saturated NHCDipp-stabilized
diboryne was also reported with a B≡B bond with a length of
1.465 Å.11 A previous study demonstrated
that inclusion of metallocene, Zr(η5-Cp)2, into a borocycle is an excellent way to stabilize boron–boron
triple bond in a cyclic environment.12 The
Zr(η5-Cp)2 fragment donates one pair of
electrons to the in-plane π-bonding orbital of B≡B triple
bond. The stabilization originated from such interaction compensates
the angle strain from cyclization.12 Thus,
the bonding situation in this Zr(η5-Cp)2-stabilized cyclic diboryne is different from that in the B2(L)2 complexes. The multidentate carbenes are also found
to stabilize the diborynes and they can be used to form stable polymers.13,14

State, (b) the (3)1∑g+ Excited State, and (c) Shape of the
Molecular Orbitals (MO) of B2
The above-discussed carbenes are known as “normal”
carbenes, which were also reported to stabilize different transient
species in a complex of the form L→En←L,
where, En = C1,15 Si1,16,17 Ge1,18,19 B2,8,10 C2,20,21 Si2,22 Ge2,23 P2,24 As2,25 P4,26 P12,27 etc.

There is another type of carbene known as “abnormal”
or “nonclassical” carbene.28−30 They are also
called mesoionic carbenes (MICs) as no canonical resonance form can
be drawn for these carbenes without the introduction of formal charges
on the carbene carbon (Ccarb) center. In MICs, one or both
the heteroatoms adjacent to the Ccarb may be removed. This
removal of heteroatoms increases the donor ability of abnormal carbenes
compared to the normal one, but at the same time, it reduces the stability
of the carbene.31,32 There was always a question raised
about the true carbenic properties of MICs. As the concept of carbenes
starts with the divalency of Ccarb, it is also supposed
to be valid for both of the normal and abnormal carbenes. But the
Ccarb of MICs is tetravalent. Another flaw is that MICs
do not dimerize following the Wanzlick equilibrium as found in the
normal carbenes.29,31,32 Moreover, it is believed that a true carbene must have six valence
electrons at Ccarb-center. But, only CH2 is
found to follow this “sextet” rule at Ccarb-center. The normal carbenes are also represented with a Lewis structure
having six valence electrons at the Ccarb-center. But it
receives π electron density from the adjacent heteroatoms and,
thus, the Ccarb-center can be represented as 8e resonance
structure. On the other hand, there is no possibility for MICs to
attain a 6e structure because all probable resonance forms correspond
to an 8e count at the Ccarb-center. Despite such differences
in the free state, both normal carbenes and MICs show similar kind
of electronic structure, bonding pattern, and chemical reactivity
upon binding with metals.29,31 As soon as carbenes
bind with metal, it loses its divalency and 6e count at the Ccarb center and octet character at this center is grown. Thus,
the distinction between them is lost upon binding. The whole carbene
family has proven its versatile behavior in metalcatalysis,33−36 organocatalysis,37−39 main group synthesis,15−27 activation of small molecules,40,41 and many more
processes.

In this paper, we have studied the possibility of
attaining B≡B
triple bond supported by MICs via density functional theory (DFT)-based
computations, and their stability and bonding situation are compared
to those reported for NHC- and cAAC-supported B≡B triple bond
compounds. We have considered five MICs, viz., imidazolin-4-ylidenes
(MIC1)-, pyrazolin-4-ylidene (MIC2)-, 1,2,3-triazol-5-ylidene (MIC3)-,
tetrazol-5-ylidene (MIC4)-, and isoxazol-4-ylidene (MIC5)-based carbenes
(see Scheme 2).42−46

Scheme 2 Schematic Representation of the Carbenes Considered for the Study
The electronic structure calculations
and the bonding analysis
via energy decomposition analysis (EDA) in conjunction with natural
orbital for chemical valence (NOCV) suggest that MICs can stabilize
the diboryne and the triple-bond character between the two B atoms
is almost the same as in the NHCMe- and cAACMe-stabilized B2(L)2 systems.

Results and Discussion
Structures
and Stability
First of all, we validate
our chosen level of theory by comparing the computed geometrical parameters
to those of the previously synthesized B2(NHCDipp)2 and B2(cAACDipp)2 (Dipp
= 2,6-diisopropylphenyl) complexes (see Figure S1, Supporting Information). Our computed results show good
agreement with the experimentally determined parameters, and the differences
are within the range of solid-state effects. We then replace the bulky
−Dipp group with −Me group for computational economy
and maintain similar side group in all of the considered ligands.
The optimized geometries of all of the seven carbenes under study
are presented in Figure 1 along with their structural parameters.

Figure 1 Optimized geometries
of the carbenes calculated at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p)
level. Bond lengths are in angstrom unit, and angles are in degree
unit.

The ∠X–Ccarb–X (X = C, N) angle
varies between 99.4 and 106.5°. The maximum ∠X–Ccarb–X angle is 106.5° in cAACMe. The
∠X–Ccarb–X angle in all MICs is slightly
lower than or comparable to the ∠N–Ccarb–N
angle in NHCMe. The Ccarb–N bond lengths
vary in the range of 1.309 Å (cAACMe) to 1.407 Å
(MIC1), which is between those of C–N single (1.421 Å)
and C=N double-bond lengths (1.293 Å),26 suggesting some degree of double-bond character due to
the conjugation. A similar kind of situation can be noted in the bond
between Ccarb-center and adjacent C atom. The Ccarb–C bond length in cAACMe is 1.525 Å, which
is the largest and almost equal to a C–C single bond distance.
But in the MICs, Ccarb–C bond lengths fall in the
range of 1.340–1.416 Å, attaining some double-bond character
due to conjugation. Therefore, the sharp differences in geometrical
parameters between cAACMe and MIC1 indicate that the replacement
of a single carbon atom of the ring by a nitrogen atom causes some
significant structural alteration.

The singlet–triplet
energy gap (ΔES–T), which
is used to describe the stability of
carbene, is computed and presented in Table 1. A carbene with higher ΔES–T value would have larger stability in its singlet
state. The adibatic ΔES–T values for NHCMe and cAACMe are −85.5
and −48.9 kcal/mol, respectively, where a negative sign indicates
higher stability of singlet state than the triplet one. The absence
of one nitrogen center in cAACMe (one adjacent nitrogen
center) diminishes the ΔES–T value by 36.6 kcal/mol compared to that in NHCMe (two
adjacent nitrogen centers). We note that the ΔES–T value of a ligand plays a very crucial role
in the electronic structure of the ligand-stabilized species. Recently
reported (E)(L)BB(L)(E) (L = NHC, cAAC; E = SPh) is a classic example
of that where a triplet ground state with a twisted SBBS unit in cAAC-stabilized
complex and a singlet ground state with a planar central SBBS in NHC
bound analogue can be properly explained from their ΔES–T values.47 On the other hand, the ΔES–T values for MIC1, MIC3, and MIC4 are larger than those in cAACMe, but in the cases of MIC2 and MIC5 because of the absence
of any Ccarb–N conjugation, the ΔES–T values eventually become lower than those in
the latter one. Therefore, Ccarb–N interaction has
an important role to gain large ΔES–T. Further, the computed energy gap between the highest occupied molecular
orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO),
ΔEH–L, which is also a stability
and reactivity indicator, is well correlated with the ΔES–T, except for cAACMe. Similar
to ΔES–T, the ΔEH–L value is maximum for NHCMe (6.40 eV) and minimum for MIC2 (3.74 eV). All MICs have somewhat
lower ΔEH–L value than cAACMe, indicating that MICs would show higher reactivity than
the latter one. The partial natural charges at the Ccarb-center are also listed in Table 2, which shows that the Ccarb-center of NHCMe and cAACMe are slightly electropositive in nature,
whereas among MICs, except for MIC4, all carry significant negative
charges on the Ccarb-center. We note that among MICs, only
MIC4 has two N-atoms at the adjacent position of the Ccarb, which are responsible for the positive charge on Ccarb.

The minimum energy structures
of all of the studied B2(L)2 structures are
presented in Figure 2. While B2(NHCMe)2 corresponds to
a D2 symmetry
and B2(cAACMe)2 and B2(MIC4)2 belong to C1 point
group, other complexes have C2 symmetry
in their singlet spin state. The B–B bond length in free X3∑g– B2 molecules
is computed to be 1.616 Å at our computational level (experimental
B–B bond length is 1.590 Å in B2 molecule).48,49

geometries of the carbenes-stabilized diboryne B2(L)2 (L = NHCMe, cAACMe,
MIC1, MIC2, MIC3, MIC4, and MIC5) complexes calculated at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p)
level. Bond lengths are in angstrom unit, and angles are in degree
unit.

The B–B bond lengths are
1.455 and 1.487 Å in B2(NHCMe)2 and B2(cAACMe)2 complexes, respectively,
which agree well with
the experimental B–B bond lengths in B2(NHCDipp)2 (1.449 Å) and B2(cAACDipp)2 (1.489 Å) complexes. On the other hand,
the B–B bond distance in B2(MICs)2 complexes
ranges between 1.453 (MIC1) and 1.457 (MIC4) Å. Hence, it is
clear that the B–B bond distances in B2(MICs)2 are similar to those in B2(NHCMe)2 and somewhat smaller than those in B2(cAACMe)2. This distance is also in good agreement with
the predicted B≡B bond length of 1.46 Å.9 The B–Ccarb bond lengths in B2(NHCMe)2 and B2(cAACMe)2 are 1.482 and 1.454 Å, respectively. All of the
B–Ccarb bond lengths in B2(MICs)2 complexes are larger than those in B2(cAACMe)2. Among MICs, the smallest B–Ccarb bond length is noted in B2(MIC4)2 as 1.476
Å, which is even smaller than that in B2(NHCMe)2. We note that direct correlation between bond length
and the strength of the donor–acceptor interaction cannot be
drawn as observed previously. Upon complexation, the bond lengths
between the Ccarb-center and the adjacent atom (hetero
or homo) and the ∠X–Ccarb–X angles
in carbenes increase compared to those in the free carbenes in all
cases.

It is shown that the B–B bond stretching frequencies
(∼1700
cm–1) in B2(NHCDipp)2, B2(NHCDep)2, and B2(cAACDipp)2 fit well with the trend known for
triple bonds in dinitrogen (N≡N) and alkynes (C≡C).50 The corresponding frequencies of the B–B
stretching mode (ν(BB)) in B2(L)2 complexes
are presented in Table 2. Here, we have only considered 11B/11B pair
of B-atoms for our study. The simulated ν(BB) is 1687 cm–1 for B2(NHCDipp)2 and 1645 cm–1 for B2(cAACDipp)2, which are in good agreement with the experimental
frequency values.50 The computed values
for the −Me variants are slightly larger than the former ones
(1724 and 1667 cm–1 for B2(NHCMe)2 and B2(cAACMe)2 complexes,
respectively). For MICs-supported complexes, the ν(BB) values
range from 1724 (MIC4) to 1680 (MIC2) cm–1. Therefore,
all of them have larger ν(BB) values than those in cAACMe. In fact, MIC4 equalizes the value with NHCMe. Therefore, very comparable ν(BB) values to those in experimentally
reported and theoretically well-established systems indicate that
all of these B–B bonds can be considered as triple bonds.

Next, we have checked the bonding indices. The WBIs for the B–B
and B–Ccarb bonds and natural charges on the B and
C atoms in these complexes are provided in Table 2. The WBI(BB) values are computed to be 2.06
and 1.71 for the B–B bonds in B2(NHCMe)2 and B2(cAACMe)2 complexes,
respectively. We note that although the WBI(BB) values are much lower
than 3 and often much lowered value than the actual bond order is
noted for delocalized systems, we may use these values as a parameter
to compare with other B2(MICs)2. For these systems,
the WBI(BB) values vary from 1.98 (MIC4) to 2.16 (MIC2), indicating
almost equal bond order as that in NHCMe. The natural charges
on the B2 in B2(L)2 complexes are
negative except for the B2(cAACMe)2 complex. The B–L bonds in the B2(L)2 complexes are described as donor–acceptor interaction (vide
infra). The total natural charges on the B2 and carbenes
indicate about the relative size of electron donation and back donation.
The net negative charge on the B2 moiety indicates the
acceptance of more electron density through the L→[B2]←L σ-donation than the L←[B2]→L
π-back donation.

We have analyzed two dissociation processes
that include B–B
and B–Ccarb bond dissociations in the complexes:
(i) L–BB–L (1A)→2 B–L (4A) and (ii) L–BB–L (1A)→BB
(X3∑g+) + 2 L (1A). The first dissociation channel determines the strength of the
B≡B bonds, and the second one determines the B–Ccarb bond strength in B2(L)2 complexes
(see Table 3). The
zero-point energy (ZPE)-corrected dissociation energies (D0) and free-energy changes (ΔG)
at 298 K representing B≡B bond (first dissociation channel)
and B–Ccarb bond (second dissociation channel) are
computed to have very large values, reflecting very strong bond formation.
The high endergonicity of such dissociations is also confirmed from
the corresponding ΔG values. In all cases,
the sum of two B–L bonds is somewhat stronger than the B≡B
bond. Irrespective of B–Ccarb or B≡B, the
B2(cAACMe)2 complex has the highest D0 value among others. The rB≡B is maximum for the B2(cAACMe)2 complex; thus, a low D0 value for the B≡B bond dissociation is expected. But one
should remember that the correlation between the bond length and bond
strength does not hold good in all cases.51−53 The D0 value for the B≡B bond in B2(NHCMe)2 is computed to be 167.6 kcal/mol,
whereas the same for MICs-supported complexes ranges from 155.2 (MIC5)
to 164.2 (MIC3) kcal/mol, reflecting comparable B≡B bond strength
to that with the former one. Moreover, the B–Ccarb bond strength in B2(MICs)2 is also very similar
to that in B2(NHCMe)2, which indicates
the similarity in the donor–acceptor interactions in these
systems.

Molecular Orbitals
Further, the
similarity in the electronic
structure and bonding patterns between the MICs and NHCMe- and cAACMe-stabilized B2(L)2 complexes
can easily be understood from the associated molecular orbital (MO)
pictures. The most informative MOs for these complexes are depicted
in Figure 3. In the
case of B2(NHCMe)2 complex, the HOMO
and HOMO–1 correspond to the B–B π-bonding, and
HOMO–6 and HOMO–14 correspond to the B–B σ-bonding.
HOMO–13 represents the B–B antibonding in the complex,
thus giving a triple bond character in this B2(NHCMe)2 complex. HOMO–13 and HOMO–14
represent the electron σ-donation from NHC to the vacant 2σu* and 3σg orbitals of B2 in the
third excited 1∑g+ state.54 A similar set of MOs in the B2(MIC)2 complexes is also presented. In all cases, HOMO and HOMO–1
represent the two π-MOs in the complexes. These MOs have p(π)-orbital
coefficients from the central moiety as well as the donor atom in
the MICs. The next three MOs depict the σ-bonding in the complexes
as can be found in the NHCMe- and cAACMe-stabilized
complexes.

Energy Decomposition Analysis
Further important information
about the bonding situation can be obtained from the EDA-NOCV results
in which the orbital interaction is presented as a sum of pairwise
contributions from specific pairs of orbitals detailing about their
strength numerically. Further, this analysis also allows us to graphically
visualize the impact of such pairwise orbital interaction on the electronic
structure. Table 4 provides
the numerical results of EDA-NOCV computations of B2(L)2 complexes taking (3)1∑g+ B2 species as one fragment and (L)2 as another.55 Because of the similar
MOs reflecting similar electronic structure, for B2(MIC)2, this scheme is the most logical one. Similar to the D0 values, the intrinsic interaction energy (ΔEint) for the B–L bonds in the B2(cAACMe)2 complex is the largest (−351.8
kcal/mol), whereas for the remaining complexes, the ΔEint values range from −302.3 (MIC4) to
−309.5 (MIC2) kcal/mol and are comparable to those in the NHCMe-supported complex. These high ΔEint values suggest strong interaction between the excited B2 fragment and donor centers and it can easily compensate the
electronic excitation energy of B2. For all complexes,
the ΔEorb term plays the major role
(contribution: ca. 52.2–55.0%) in the stabilization of the
B–L bonds, whereas the coulombic attraction, ΔEelstat, is responsible for the 43.4–46.3%
of the total attraction. The dispersion energy is least important
here (ca. 1.3–1.7%). We note that both the enhanced orbital
and coulomb interactions are responsible for the larger ΔEint value in the B2(cAACMe)2 complex than that in the others, although larger Pauli
repulsion in the former nullifies some part of such attractive gain.
The magnitudes of ΔEorb and ΔEelstat terms in MICs are quite comparable to
those in NHCMe.

a Energy values are in kcal/mol.

b The values in parentheses give the
percentage contribution to the total attractive interactions (ΔEelstat + ΔEorb + ΔEdisp).

c The values in parentheses give the
percentage contribution to the total orbital interactions ΔEorb.

The NOCV calculations further decompose the ΔEorb into pairwise contributions between occupied and vacant
MOs of the interacting fragment terms, presenting us with the quantitative
size of L→[B2]←L σ-donations and L←[B2]→L π-back donations. The associated electron
density flow is visualized through the plots of four main deformation
densities, Δρ1–Δρ4, as shown in Figure 4. Here, the charge is shifted from the red to blue region. Δρ(σ1) represents the in-phase (+, +) σ-donation from the
two carbene ligands toward the vacant 3σg orbital
(LUMO + 1) on (3)1∑g+ B2 moiety, whereas Δρ(σ2) represents
the out-of-phase (+, −) σ-donation from the two carbene
ligands toward the vacant 2σu* orbital (LUMO) of
the B2 fragments. Because of the better overlap in the
(+, +) combination than in the (+, −) combination, the associated
ΔEσ1 is larger than ΔEσ2. The next two deformation channels,
Δρ(π1) and Δρ(π2), are originated from the two L←[B2]→L
π-back donations from the two π orbitals on B2 to L. Obviously, the contribution from the sum of two σ-donations
(ca. 58.7–65.7% of ΔEorb)
is significantly larger than that from the sum of two π-back
donations (ca. 24.2–35.7% of ΔEorb). Since (+, +) and (+, −) σ-donations populate
bonding and antibonding σ-orbitals of B2, respectively,
their impact on the bond order would almost nullify each other. On
the other hand, L←[B2]→L π-back donations
would weaken the B≡B bond. This would be the reason to get
lower WBI value than the ideal 3. An inspection of each orbital term
indicates that cAACMe has the largest σ-donation
and π-back donation ability. On the other hand, while the σ-donation
ability of MICs is almost the same as in NHCMe, except
for MIC2, which is only slightly smaller (by 7.7 kcal/mol), the π-back
donation ability of MICs is somewhat smaller (by 5.4–14.6 kcal/mol)
than that in NHCMe, except for MIC4. This explains why
we get slightly larger WBI(BB) values for MICs than NHCMe, except for MIC4. Therefore, all of these analyses clearly indicate
that MICs could indeed stabilize B2 species in its (3)1∑g+ excited state and the stability
is very comparable to that of NHCMe.

Conclusions
The present quantum chemical DFT calculations
reveal that mesoionic
carbenes (MICs), viz., imidazolin-4-ylidenes (MIC1), pyrazolin-4-ylidene
(MIC2), 1,2,3-triazol-5-ylidene (MIC3), tetrazol-5-ylidene (MIC4),
and isoxazol-4-ylidene (MIC5) are suitable candidates to stabilize
B2 species in its (3)1∑g+ excited state resulting in an effective B–B bond order
of 3. The B–B bond distance, Wiberg bond order, and molecular
orbitals are very comparable to those of experimentally reported B2(NHCMe)2 and B2(cAACMe)2. Further, the inspection of the stability of
these B2(L)2 complexes against L–BB–L
→ 2 B–L and L–BB–L → BB + 2 L indicates
high stability of MICs-supported complexes, which is also very comparable
to that in B2(NHCMe)2. Finally, EDA-NOCV
results confirm the similar bonding situation in B2(MICs)2 complexes and B2(NHCMe)2 and B2(cAACMe)2, where 3σg and 2σu* orbitals of (3)1∑g+ B2 moiety accept (+, +) and (+, −)
σ-donations from (L)2, respectively, with the former
interaction stronger than the latter one. L←[B2]→L
π-back donation from the two π orbitals on B2 to L also plays a role in the B–L interaction, but its contribution
is significantly smaller than the L→[B2]←L
σ-donation. Among the considered ligands, cAACMe has
the largest σ-donation and π-back donation ability, whereas
the σ-donation and π-back donation abilities of MICs are
comparable to those in NHCMe. In fact, the π-back
donation ability of MICs is somewhat lower than that in NHCMe, except for MIC4. Therefore, the present results indicate that apart
from NHC and cAAC, MICs are also very suitable ligands to produce
compounds containing B–B triple bond, at ambient conditions.
For this aspect, so far, these ligands have not been considered and
hence they need proper attention toward experimental realization of
new B2(L)2 complexes with B≡B bond. In
future, we would investigate the difference in reactivity between
B2(MICs)2 complexes and that of B2(NHCMe)2 and B2(cAACMe)2.

Computational Details
Geometries
of all of the studied compounds were optimized without
any constraints with B3LYP56−58 functional in conjunction with
6-311G(d,p)59 basis set. The resulting
structures are then reoptimized at the same level by imposing the
closest point group. The frequency calculations were also performed
at the same level taking the optimized geometries of the complexes.
All real frequencies confirm that the structures are at the minima
on their respective potential energy surfaces. The partial charge
on each atomic center and Wiberg bond indices (WBI) were computed
using the natural bond orbital analysis scheme.60−63 All of the above computations
were performed with the help of the GAUSSIAN 09 program.64

The energy decomposition analysis in conjunction
with natural orbitals
of chemical valence (EDA-NOCV) computations65,66 was carried out at the B3LYP-D3(BJ)/TZ2P//B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level
using the ADF2017.01 program package.67,68 In the EDA
scheme, the interaction energy (ΔEint) between two fragments under consideration is decomposed into four
energy terms as 1  The Pauli repulsion energy, ΔEPauli, accounts for the repulsion between the
electrons of the same spin of the occupied orbitals, and it is calculated
by employing Kohn–Sham determinant on the superimposed fragments
to obey the Pauli principle by antisymmetrization and renormalization.
The classical electrostatic interaction energy, ΔEelstat, is computed by taking the two fragments at their
optimized coordinates (as in the parent complexes), but the charge
distribution is considered to be unperturbed on each fragment by the
other one. ΔEorb stands for the
orbital interaction energy and it originates from the mixing of the
orbitals, charge transfer, and polarization between the fragments.
Finally, ΔEdisp represents the dispersion
energy correction toward the total attraction energy.

The EDA-NOCV
calculation combines the energy and charge decomposition
schemes and divide the deformation density, Δρ(r), associated with the bond formation, into different components
(σ, π, δ) of a chemical bond. From the mathematical
point of view, for each NOCV, ψi is defined as an eigenvector of the deformation density matrix in
the basis of fragment orbitals. 2  In EDA-NOCV,
ΔEorb is given by the following
equation 3  where −F–kTS and FkTS are diagonal Kohn–Sham
matrix elements corresponding to NOCVs with the eigenvalues −ν k and ν k, respectively. The ΔEkorb terms are assigned to a particular type
of bond by visual inspection of the shape of the deformation density,
Δρk. The EDA-NOCV scheme thus provides both
qualitative (Δρorb) and quantitative (ΔEorb) information about the strength of orbital
interactions in chemical bonds.
