Biocompatible surface-active ionic liquid (SAIL) was used first
to study the deintercalation process of a well-known natural compound
piperine (PIP) as an anticancer drug, obtained from PIP–calf
thymus DNA (ctDNA) complex under controlled experimental conditions.
In this study, we have been exploring the interaction of PIP in SAIL
(1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium octyl sulfate ionic liquid ([C4mim][C8OSO3])), ctDNA, and deintercalation
of PIP from the PIP–ctDNA complex through SAIL micelle using
various spectroscopic techniques. Absorption, emission, and lifetime
decay measurements provide strong evidence of the relocation of PIP
molecules from ctDNA to SAIL micelle. Fluorescence quenching and steady-state
fluorescence anisotropy were employed to examine the exact location
of PIP in different media. Moreover, the surface tension technique
was also employed to confirm the release of PIP molecules from the
PIP–ctDNA complex in the presence of SAIL. Circular dichroism
analysis suggested that SAIL micelle does not perturb the ctDNA structure,
which supported the fact that SAIL micelle can be used as a safe vehicle
for PIP. Overall, the study highlighted a novel strategy for deintercalation
of drug using SAIL because the release of the drug can be controlled
over a period by varying the concentration and composition of the
SAIL.

1 Introduction
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a chief target for many anticancer
drugs because of this drug–DNA interaction that provides valuable
information in the cancer research. Drug–DNA interaction gives
an idea about the three-dimensional shape of the complex and the binding
mechanism, that is, whether it is a covalent or noncovalent binding.
It is well-known that the noncovalent binding of drug–DNA interaction
are classified into three broad classes: (1) intercalation, (2) groove
binding, and (3) electrostatic interaction. In the intercalation,
the drug binds to DNA between its adjacent base pairs of strand, whereas
in groove binding, the drugs fit into the minor or major groove of
DNA.1,2 The release of the drug from the DNA was
also an important fact in pharmacology research. On this prospect
from the last few years, researchers are focused on the deintercalation
processes through different carriers.3−5

Deintercalation is the process of removal of bound ligands or drugs
from the biomolecule (DNA or protein) with the help of a carrier (such
as micelles and liposome). The micelles are the simplest structure
that easily modulate the drug DNA binding equilibrium. These nanostructures
provide a hydrophobic environment to the drug by which it deintercalates
from DNA and absorbs into the hydrophobic core of micelles without
disturbing the DNA structure.6,7 Westerlund et al. have
reported the dissociation of cationic DNA binding ligands in pre-
and postmicellar concentration ranges of the monomeric surfactant.5 Also, Chakraborty and co-workers have reported
the deintercalation processes of doxorubicin from DNA through different
biocompatible liposomes.4 Patra et al.
have also carried out the thermodynamic study about the deintercalation
process of the cationic dyes phenosafranine (PSF) from DNA using SDS
micelle.3 From the vast literature survey,
there is still no report of deintercalation processes using ionic
liquid (ILs) micelles. ILs are novel greener solvent with many fascinating
properties. From the last few decays, research studies explored the
IL as a drug carrier in life sciences and medical field because of
its highly tunable nature, low toxicity, greenness, low bioaccumulation,
bioavailability, and selective catalytic behavior.8−11 Herein, we utilized the surface-active
IL (SAIL) micelle for deintercalation of the drug from the calf thymus
DNA (ctDNA).

It was also reported that the rate of deintercalation depends on
the hydrophobic chain length of the carrier. Therefore, in this work,
we have utilized more hydrophobic anionic SAIL, that is, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium
octyl sulfate ([C4mim][C8SO4]), instead
of surfactants or liposome because the presence of long alkyl chain
in its anionic moiety provides a special character; as a result, they
behave as surfactants. Moreover, it was also reported that ILs are
less toxic and more greener than surfactants, which make them safe
drug carriers than surfactants.12,13 The critical micelle
concentration (cmc) of ([C4mim][C8SO4]) is 31.35 mM, which was confirmed by Langmuir microtensiometer.14 Recently, researchers have a great interest
to study the photophysical and chemical properties of many drugs or
natural product in the SAIL and explore SAIL-containing microemulsions
and micelles.15−17 From the overall viewpoint, we choose the [C4mim][C8SO4] because of its modest biodegradation
properties over other ILs.18 However, SAILs
have found to increase the drug permeability of the biological membranes.
Owing to the small size of the micelle and good stability of the drug
in micelle, the micelle can act as good drug carriers with advantages
over other drug carriers.10,19 Moreover, the micelle
enhances drug bootability and reduces the loss, degradation, and hazardous
side effect of the drug. This is all possible because micelles lessen
the contact of the drug molecule with enzyme and other body fluids
when compared to the free drug molecule.10,20 The experiment by Rangel-Yagui et al.21 showed the solubility of the drug molecules in the micellar system
because of the association between the drug and the surfactant micelle.
Similarly, Mahajan et al.22 have studied
the extent of binding of drug (dopamine hydrochloride and acetylcholine
chloride) with SAILs and compared with conventional surfactant TTAB.
They suggested that drugs interact in the outer portion of the SAIL
micelle and surfactant, but SAILs act as better carriers for drug
than surfactants. From the literature, it was observed that SAILs
acts as a better drug carrier compared to conventional cationic surfactants.10,16,22−26

In this work, we have shown the intercalation of piperine (PIP)
with ctDNA and followed by deintercalation in the presence of SAIL
micelle (Scheme 2).
PIP (1-piperoylpiperidine) is the major bioactive alkaloid phytochemical
extracted from the fruit and the root of black pepper (Piper nigrum L.) and long pepper (Piper longum L.) plants from the Piperaceae family27 (Scheme 1). It has been reported recently that PIP controls and reduces
the progression of tumor cell growth and induces apoptosis.28 Lai et al. reported that PIP suppressed the
tumor growth and metastasis of 4T1 cell of breast cancer in the mouse
model.29 It was also reported that PIP
inhibits the development of prostate cancer cells mediated through
decreased expression of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)
and phosphorylated STAT-3 in LNCaP cells.30 PIP also has the ability to bind with the G-quadruplex DNA structure,
which makes it more significant as a chemotherapeutic agent for cancers;
it also provides deviations in the DNA metabolism.31

Scheme 1 Structure of PIP
We have divided our present work into three sections (Scheme 2). The first section explains about the encapsulation of PIP
in a micellar environment formed by SAIL. The second section deals
with the interaction of PIP with ctDNA, followed by the third section
which deals with the deintercalation of PIP from the PIP–DNA
complex in SAIL by using different spectroscopic techniques and surface
tension method.

Micelle
2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Absorption and Emission Spectral Study
The absorption spectra of PIP observed three absorption bands at
250 and 342 nm with a small shoulder of 311 nm in an aqueous buffer
solution (Figure S1A), and the emission
spectra of PIP was found to be a single strong peak at 486 nm in an
aqueous buffer solution (Figure S1B). To
determine the behavior and encapsulation of the PIP in SAIL micelle
microenvironment, the absorption and emission spectroscopy was utilized.3Figure 1 demonstrates the absorption spectra of PIP in the absence
and presence of different concentrations of SAIL (2–35 mM).
After the addition of SAIL, the intensity of all absorbance bands
steadily increased with a minor blueshift (342–335 nm) (Figure 1A). Figure 1B represents the relative change
in the absorbance of PIP at 342 nm and a maxima absorbance of the
PIP against the pre- to postmicellar concentration of SAIL. The blueshift
is an indicator that PIP molecules go to more hydrophobic region,
which signifies an environment change from bulk aqueous to SAIL micellar
region.16 Conclusively, as the environment
drifts from monomeric SAIL to micellar SAIL, the absorption spectrum
shows a large hyperchromicity. From Figure 1B initially, at a lower concentration of
SAIL (2 mM), the decrease in the absorbance of the PIP is because
of the involvement of electrostatic interaction.32 After this, as the concentration of the SAIL increases,
a blueshift with hyperchromicity was observed in the absorbance of
PIP which suggested that PIP was entrapped into the core of the micelle
because of hydrophobic–hydrophobic interaction.32 Further, a relative change in the absorbance
and alteration in maxima absorbance of PIP recommended that PIP goes
from polar to nonpolar environment and is situated inside the hydrodynamic
sphere of the SAIL micelle.

Figure 1 (A) Absorption spectra of PIP (50 μM) in different concentrations
of SAIL (2–35 mM) and (B) plots of variation of relative absorbance
(red) and absorbance maxima (blue) of PIP in the presence of SAIL.

The emission spectrum of PIP shows a strong single peak at 486
nm when exited at 342 nm33 (Figure S1B). SAIL also shows emission spectra
at 415 nm at its higher concentration; however, it does not obstruct
the emission peak of PIP (Figure S2A,B). Figure 2A shows that on the
addition of SAIL (pre-cmc to post-cmc concentration), the intensity
of PIP steadily increases with a large blueshift. Many-fold enhancement
of the fluorescence relative intensity and the large blueshift about
22 nm (486–464 nm) show that PIP interacts with SAIL and alters
the microenvironment of PIP through the relocation of fluorophore
molecule from a high-polarity environment (buffer) to a low polar
region (the hydrocarbon core of the SAIL micelle) (Figure 2B). This result also favored
a stronger binding between PIP and SAIL and a possible intake of PIP
molecules into the SAIL micelle. A similar observation was previously
reported in cases of PSF and SDS systems.3 The overall absorption and emission spectroscopy result suggested
that the microenvironment around the fluorophore molecule is different
when compared to its native environment, and PIP is introduced to
the micellar region of SAIL. The emission spectral change of PIP in
the presence of SAIL was further utilized to determine the penetration
of PIP in the SAIL micelle. To support our absorption and emission
results related to the penetration of PIP into the SAIL micelle, the
partition coefficient was also determined using the following relationship34 1  where Kp is the
partition coefficient of PIP from aqueous to micellar phase. I0, It, and I∞ are the fluorescence
intensities of PIP in the absence of SAIL, an intermediate, saturated
concentration, respectively. The value of Kp was calculated from the slope of the (I∞ – I0)/(It – I0) versus [SAIL]−1 plot (Figure S3). The
value of Kp was obtained around 3.9 ×
103. The high magnitude of Kp for PIP and SAIL micelle system suggested partitioning of the PIP
in the SAIL micelle.16 Moreover, the high
value of Kp suggested that there is a
favorable binding between PIP and SAIL micelle, which is a stable
system.

Figure 2 (A) Emission spectra of PIP (50 μM) in different concentrations
of SAIL (2–35 mM) and (B) plots of variation of emission maxima
(red) and relative fluorescence intensity (blue) of PIP in the presence
of SAIL.

The absorption and emission profile of PIP with an increasing concentration
of ctDNA (0.22–1.25 μM) is depicted in Figure 3. The absorption spectra show
that the addition of ctDNA to PIP solution causes substantial decrease
in the absorbance spectra of PIP without any considerable shift (Figure 3A). It is a previous
report and generally accepted information that groove binding corresponds
to the insignificant or minor shift in the absorbance maxima, whereas
a large shift is found in the intercalation process when the ligand
binds to DNA with a base stack.35,36 This phenomenon suggested
that PIP binds with ctDNA through groove binding.33 In the emission spectral studies (Figure 3B), the fluorescence intensity of PIP was
decreased gradually with the addition of different concentrations
of ctDNA (0.22–1.29 mM) without any shift in maxima emission.
The extreme amount of quenching was observed at the maximum concentration
of ctDNA (1.29 mM), indicating that maximum PIP molecule binds to
ctDNA and a negligible quantity of unbounded PIP was leftover in the
aqueous solution. Das et al. also reported a similar type of results
for PSF binding with ctDNA.4 To confirm
the exact binding mechanism of PIP to ctDNA, we performed the ethidium
bromide (EB) fluorescence displacement experiment. EB is a well-known
intercalating agent, and it binds between the base pairs of DNA, which
cause enhancement of the fluorescence intensity.37 On the addition of PIP (up to 50 μM) in to the EB–ctDNA
system, the fluorescence intensity of the EB–ctDNA system was
decreased insignificantly (Figure S4).
Small reductions in fluorescence intensity of the EB–ctDNA
complex signify that PIP does not displace EB molecules from the ctDNA.
This result again confirmed the groove binding between PIP and ctDNA.38 The Stern–Volmer quenching constant (Ksv) was also determined from the fluorescence
data using Stern–Volmer equation39,40 and was found
to be 3.25 × 103 M–1 (Figure S5). This result exposed that with the
addition of ctDNA, the fluorescence intensity was dropped rapidly
and ctDNA was bound to PIP.

Figure 3 (A) Absorption spectra of PIP (50 μM) in different concentrations
of ctDNA (0.22–1.29 mM) and (B) emission spectra of PIP (50
μM) in different concentrations of ctDNA (0.22–1.29 mM).

The deintercalation of PIP from PIP–ctDNA complex to SAIL
micelle has been observed spectrophotometrically. The absorption and
emission profiles of PIP bound ctDNA (1:25 stoichiometric ratio at
maximum binding, as previously seen from the PIP–ctDNA binding
study) with a rising concentration of SAIL (2–35 mM) are shown
in Figure 4. As SAIL
was added to the PIP–ctDNA complex, the absorbance spectra
of PIP increased with a blueshift from 340 nm in ctDNA to 334 nm in
micellar medium. Enhancement in absorbance spectra and blueshift at
cmc concentration showed that the microenvironment of PIP changes,
that is, PIP migrates from ctDNA to SAIL micelle (Figure 4A). The position of the absorption
maximum of the PIP was observed (Figure 2A) at 335 nm in the SAIL micelle medium.
The overall absorbance study of PIP in SAIL (Figure 1B) and PIP–ctDNA complex in SAIL (Figure 4B) was suggested
that PIP relocated from ctDNA to the micellar environment of the SAIL.41 Further, the deintercalation phenomenon, that
is, relocation of PIP from ctDNA to SAIL micelle, was confirmed by
emission spectra. As shown in Figure 5A, the fluorescence intensity of PIP–ctDNA complex
with increasing concentrations of SAIL was increased with a considerable
blueshift about 20 nm. This large shift along with the evident increase
in fluorescence intensity indicates that PIP resides into the core
of SAIL micelle (Figure 5B). Figure 6 again
shows the relocation of PIP from ctDNA to SAIL micelle. The overall
absorbance and emission spectroscopy results confirmed that PIP was
encapsulated in SAIL micelle and showed groove binding with ctDNA.
Further, it was confirmed that as we increase SAIL concentration (above
cmc) with ctDNA–PIP complex, PIP dissociates from ctDNA to
micellar environment of SAIL. On this viewpoint, we will again confirm
this assumption through other techniques in the forthcoming sections.

systems.

2.2 Isothermal Titration Calorimetry
We have utilized isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) for observing
the thermodynamic and binding parameters of PIP in SAIL and ctDNA,
and also for deintercalation of PIP from ctDNA to SAIL micelle. The
ITC profiles of the titration of SAIL in PIP and PIP–ctDNA
complex, and PIP with ctDNA are shown in Figure 7, and the corresponding thermodynamic and
binding parameters are listed in Table 1. Figure 7A and Table 1 showed
clearly that the migration of PIP to SAIL micelle is an enthalpy-driven
process (ΔH0 = −5.57 kcal
mol–1) with negative entropy change (TΔS0 = −2.98 kcal mol–1). The free-energy change (ΔG0) was also calculated from the following relationship 2  

Figure 7 ITC profiles for the (A) PIP + SAIL interaction, (B) PIP + ctDNA
complex formation, and (C) PIP–ctDNA (1:25) complex with SAIL.

Table 1 Binding Constant (Kb) and Thermodynamic Parameter of PIP in Different System
Drive from ITC
s. no.	system	Kb M–1	ΔH (kcal mol–1)	TΔS (kcal mol–1)	ΔG (kcal mol–1)	
1	PIP + SAIL	78.1 ± 3.6	–5.57 ± 0.25	–2.98	–2.59	
2	PIP + ctDNA	10.1 × 104 ± 40	–71.80 ± 1.44	–64.96	–6.84	
3	PIP–ctDNA + SAIL	105 ± 8.5	–0.35 ± 0.07	2.40	–2.75	
The negative values of ΔG0 (−2.59
kcal mol–1) shows spontaneity in the binding process.
The large negative value of enthalpy shows that the migration of PIP
to SAIL micelle involved the disruption of water structure at micellar
surface which provides a more hydrophobic environment to PIP than
its previous state.3,32 This result is in good agreement
with our spectroscopic results. The binding of PIP with ctDNA was
also governed through the exothermic process (ΔH0 = −71.80 kcal mol–1) with a
large negative entropy contribution (TΔS0 = −64.96 kcal mol–1). The calculated ΔG0 value (−6.84
kcal mol–1) further confirms that the binding process
was spontaneous (Figure 7B and Table 1). Moreover,
the binding constant (Kb) values for PIP–ctDNA
binding was also observed and listed in Table 1 and found to be very close to the previously
reported work, which confirm the groove binding of PIP with ctDNA.33 In continuation to this, Figure 7C shows the deintercalation of PIP from ctDNA
to SAIL micelle. The less negative value of enthalpy change (ΔH0 = −0.35 kcal mol–1) was observed for PIP–ctDNA complex in the presence of SAIL
micelles with a positive entropic contribution (TΔS0 = 2.40 kcal mol–1). The positive entropic contribution showed that the migration of
PIP to SAIL micelle from ctDNA is much favorable. The Gibbs free energy
(ΔG0 = −2.75 kcal mol–1) was observed negative which suggested that the deintercalation
process was spontaneous. These thermodynamic values are complement
to the values observed for the PIP-SAIL system. Also, the value of Kb for deintercalation process (105 M–1) was observed very close to the Kb value
of PIP–SAIL system (78.1 M–1), which authenticates
our discussion about the relocation of PIP from ctDNA to SAIL micelle.
However, the value of Kb for PIP–ctDNA
system was very high (10.1 × 104). This binding result
from ITC again suggested that in composite systems, PIP favors to
binds in the SAIL micelle and releases from the ctDNA.3

2.3 Fluorescence Quenching Study
Fluorescence
quenching is a general phenomenon wherein emission intensity of fluorophore
is reduced by a quencher.42−45 The fluorescence quenching method using potassium
iodide (KI) as a quencher have been performed to determine the location
of PIP in different system. KI-induced quenching method provides an
idea about the accessibility of the entrapped or bound fluorophore
toward the quencher; as a result, it provides information about the
location of the fluorophore in microheterogeneous environments. The
quenching rate constants of PIP on the addition of quencher (KI) for
different system have been calculated by the Stern–Volmer equation46,47 3  where Ksv is the
Stern–Volmer quenching constant, I0 and I are the fluorescence intensities in the absence
and presence of the quencher (KI), and [Q] is the
molar concentration of the quencher. The higher the magnitude of Ksv, the higher will be the quenching efficiency
of the quencher, which recommends a greater degree of exposure of
the fluorophore to the quencher. Figure 8 represents the Stern–Volmer plots
for the KI induced quenching of PIP in different medium such as buffer,
ctDNA, SAIL micelle, and PIP–ctDNA complex in the SAIL micelle.
The value of Ksv of PIP in different systems
is listed in Table 2. It is clearly seen in Figure 8 and Table 2 that the fluorescence quenching of PIP in SAIL micelle is
significantly lower than that of PIP in the buffer solution. The lower Ksv value of PIP in SAIL micelle suggested that
the environment of PIP changes when compared to the buffer and PIP
residing into the hydrophobic core of the SAIL micelle. The degree
of exposure of the fluorophore toward the quencher diminishes in the
SAIL micelle, and because of these organized assemblies, the fluorophore
was unreachable to the water-soluble quencher (KI) and therefore,
there was drop in its Ksv values. Moreover,
the Ksv values of PIP–ctDNA complex
and PIP in SAIL micelle were observed to be lower than that of free
PIP (buffer). The lower Ksv value indicates
that PIP shows groove binding with ctDNA. Table 2 showed that SAIL was added in PIP–ctDNA
complex, and the Ksv value of complex
was increased and very close to PIP in the micellar system. Thus,
KI induce fluorescence quenching study, confirming that PIP binds
with ctDNA, and in micellar environment, it relocates to SAIL micelle
from ctDNA.48

different system.

2	PIP + ctDNA + KI	3.9 × 102 ± 0.0005	0.9282

4	ctDNA bounded PIP + SAIL + KI	1.44 × 103 ± 0.0012	0.9450	
2.4 Steady-State Fluorescence Anisotropy
To determine the exact location of the fluorophore in different biological
and microheterogeneous mediums (such as protein, nucleic acid, lipid,
micelle, and vesicle), we employed steady-state fluorescence anisotropy.49 When the fluorophore of molecule was excited
in polarized light, the emission from the fluorophore was polarized.
This degree of polarization of the emission is defined as anisotropy
(r), which provides a precious idea about the surrounding
environments of the fluorophores.46,50 The steady-state
fluorescence anisotropy gives an idea about the size, shape, and segmental
flexibility of a molecule affect in various moieties.

Fluorescence
anisotropy (r) value of PIP was determined in different
mediums to find out the location of PIP in these mediums. Figure 9 shows the fluorescence
anisotropy values of PIP in different medium. As shown in Figure 9, the fluorescence
anisotropy values of PIP in all environment were lower when compared
to those in a buffer medium (r = 0.330), which indicate
the decrease in rigidity at the microenvironment around the PIP upon
binding with ctDNA and SAIL. In the case of the PIP–SAIL system,
the fluorescence anisotropy value of PIP was decreased with the increasing
concentration of SAIL (Figure 9 inset). With the increasing concentration of SAIL, the monomers
of SAIL are arranged in a systematic order and restrict the rotational
motion of fluorophore. After reaching micellar concentration, the
anisotropy value of PIP was constant (r = 0.261)
which indicates that the PIP molecule goes inside a more restricted
region of the micelle. Fluorescence anisotropy result was also conformed
to a large blueshift in the fluorescence spectra. In PIP–ctDNA
system, the fluorescence anisotropy value of PIP gradually decreased
with the addition of ctDNA which goes upto 0.280. The lower fluorescence
anisotropy value indicates that PIP binds with ctDNA through groove
binding. General observation shows that in the case of intercalative
binding, the fluorescence anisotropy of fluorophores are much higher,
that is, more than 0.30.51,52 Sahoo et al. also reported
the lower anisotropy value (r = 0.20) for (dimethylamino)styryl)-1-methylpyridinium
iodide with ctDNA and showed the groove binding between them.35 Therefore, the steady-state fluorescence anisotropy
results again confirm PIP binds with the ctDNA through groove binding.
As SAIL is added into the PIP–ctDNA complex, the anisotropy
value of PIP deceases gradually and reaches 0.21 above the cmc concentration;
this indicates the change in the environment of PIP. The observed
fluorescence anisotropy value of the PIP–ctDNA complex in SAIL
environment is close to the value for PIP in SAIL medium, which again
confirmed that PIP is released from ctDNA and is incorporated into
to the SAIL micelle.49

Figure 9 Steady-state fluorescence anisotropy (r) of PIP
in different systems.

2.5 Time-Resolved Fluorescence Decay
Time-resolved fluorescence decay serve as a sensitive tool to investigate
the nature of hydration and the relaxation dynamics of the probe in
different microheterogeneous environments and excited-state interactions
of the probe.53−55 We monitored the fluorescence lifetime of PIP in
different environments (SAIL micelle and ctDNA) to find out deintercalation
of PIP from ctDNA to the SAIL micelle. The fluorescence lifetime of
PIP in SAIL, ctDNA, and PIP–ctDNA complex in SAIL medium are
shown in Figure 10 at an excitation wavelength of 342 nm, and the corresponding deconvoluted
data are listed in Tables 3, 4, and 5.
The fluorescence lifetime of PIP in buffer and with ct DNA showed
biexponential decay. PIP in buffer medium was composed of longer τ1 (3.632 ns) and shorter τ2 (0.007 ns) components
where the shorter component shows 100% amplitude. This indicates the
residence of the probe in a single environment.56 In the buffer solution, mainly, the biexponential decay
is found because of the existence of different hydrogen bonded molecules
encircled with water molecules.57 Moreover,
the origin of bi- or multiexponential decay of fluorophore may arise
because of different polarity environments in micro-heterogeneous
medium.36,58 With increasing concentrations of the ctDNA,
the contribution of longer component takes place in the major role
and the average lifetime (τavg) increases up to 2.065
nm (Table 3). The enhancement
in lifetime suggested the binding of the PIP to ctDNA. In SAIL environment,
PIP are fitted by triexponential function comprising a small relative
population of long components τ3, which represents
multiple locations of the probe environment differing in polarity.46,51 In the PIP–SAIL interaction, with the increasing concentrations
of SAIL, the average fluorescence lifetime of PIP was increased drastically
up to 6.560 ns, lowering the polarity of surrounding PIP suggesting
the incorporation of PIP in SAIL micelle (Table 4). Also, we added SAIL in PIP–ctDNA
complex and the average lifetime increased from 2.065 to 6.454 ns
(Table 5), which is
almost same as PIP alone in the SAIL environment (Table 4). Moreover, Figure 11 clearly showed the comparative
study of τavg value of PIP and PIP–ctDNA complex
in SAIL environment which evidently indicated deintercalation of PIP
from PIP–ctDNA complex to SAIL micelle. The τavg value of PIP–ctDNA complex was increased on increasing the
concentration of SAIL and reached equivalent to τavg value as that of the PIP–SAIL system (Figure 11). Almost identical lifetime average values
of both environments (PIP in SAIL and PIP–ctDNA complex in
SAIL) suggested that PIP released from ctDNA and entrapped in SAIL
micelle. Figure 10D shows the change of decay patterns of PIP in different environments
(buffer, micelle, ctDNA, and composite medium). As shown in the figure,
the lifetime of PIP–ctDNA in SAIL environment agrees well with
PIP in the SAIL medium, which suggested deintercalation of PIP from
ctDNA to SAIL micelle.

2.6 Time-Resolved Anisotropy
To determine
the microenvironment and location of the PIP in the multicomponent
environment, we utilized the time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy,
which provided information about the structural dynamics of fluorophore
in an organized assembly and biomolecule.4,59 Fluorescence
decay anisotropy is a very useful technique to study the molecular
dynamics, rotational relaxation, and structural information of fluorophore
because it directly provides the orientation dynamics of the excited
fluorophore.60 Therefore, in this work,
we also utilized time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy decay to observe
the rotational relaxation and dynamics of PIP in different mediums
(SAIL micelle, ctDNA, and composite medium) and the location of the
PIP in micellar medium. Figure 12 showed the time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy decay
of PIP in different medium. In aqueous medium (buffer), the anisotropy
decay of PIP is found to be a single exponential with a lifetime component
of 0.798 ns. Also, in the presence of the SAIL micelle, the anisotropy
decay is fitted single-exponentially; however, the rotational relaxation
decay time increases about 1.85 ns, which indicated that the environment
of PIP was changed. The significantly enhanced rotational relaxation
decay time of PIP shows the location of drug in a motion-constrained
environment (Figure 12). At higher concentrations of the ctDNA (1.25 mM), the decay pattern
of PIP was noticeably different because it was fitted biexponentially
with a longer and fast component. This observation revealed that the
rotational relaxation of the PIP molecule gets hindered after binding
with ctDNA, and this hindered rotation is eventually responsible for
the residual anisotropy of PIP molecule.46,59,61,62 As we add
SAIL in the PIP–ctDNA complex, the time-resolved anisotropy
decay was obtained in a single exponential function with a lifetime
component of 2.30 ns. The pattern of anisotropy decay profile of PIP
observes almost same as in SAIL micellar environment (Figure 12), which strongly support
our previous finding that is deintercalation of the PIP from ctDNA
to SAIL micelle.

Figure 12 Time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy (τr) decays of PIP, PIP + ctDNA, PIP + SAIL, and PIP–ctDNA
+ SAIL.

2.7 Surface Tension Study
Surface tension
is an appropriate technique to measure the micelle formation of amphiphilic
molecules.20 In this work, we have utilized
surface tension method to measure the cmc of SAIL with PIP and PIP–ctDNA
complex. The surface tension of SAIL allows us to understand its behavior
under variable circumstances. The presence of cations, anions, water,
drugs, and other molecules has a huge impact on the surface tension.63,64Figure 13 demonstrates
the plot between surface tension and log concentration of SAIL in
different mediums (water, PIP, and PIP–ctDNA complex). As shown
in the figure, a steep decrease in the linearity corresponds to the
concentration range below the cmc where only monomers of SAIL existed
at the solution surface. At higher concentrations, the solution surface
becomes crowded with SAIL and any further addition of SAIL must arrange
itself as micelles and no further change in surface tension will be
detected.65 The cmc of pure SAIL, SAIL
in PIP, and SAIL in PIP–ctDNA complex were found to be 31.35,
25.30, and 24.45 mM, respectively (Figure 13). In the presence of PIP, the cmc of the
SAIL declined from 31.35 to 25.30 mM, which shows the incorporation
of PIP in the SAIL micelle. The value of cmc obtained for SAIL–PIP
(25.30 mM) coincides with the cmc value of SAIL–PIP–ctDNA
complex (24.45 mM), which confirms that the PIP is dissociated from
PIP–ctDNA complex to the SAIL micelle. This result again supported
our spectroscopic result.

Figure 13 Surface tension of SAIL in water, PIP, and PIP–ctDNA complex.

2.8 Effect of SAIL on the Structure of ctDNA
To show better deintercalation processes, it is essential to know
the effect of SAIL micelle on the ctDNA structure. Thus, the impact
of premicellar and postmicellar concentration of SAIL on the structure
of ctDNA was observed through circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Figure 14A shows the CD
spectra of pure ctDNA with two concentrations of SAIL: one is below
cmc (10 mM) and the other is above cmc (35 mM). The CD spectrum of
ctDNA shows two characteristic peaks attributed to the right-handed
helicity: one is a positive peak at ∼275 nm and the other a
negative peak at ∼245 nm.66 As shown
in Figure 14A, on
the addition of SAIL concentration, no significant change was observed
in the CD spectrum of ctDNA. This result showed that SAIL micelle
does not affect the ctDNA structure, ensuring it is safe to use for
deintercalation processes.

Figure 14 (A) CD spectra of ctDNA (100 μM) in the presence of different
concentrations of SAIL and (B) CD spectra of ctDNA (100 μM)
with PIP (50 μM) and in the presence of different concentrations
of SAIL.

Further, we analyzed the CD spectrum of ctDNA with PIP and PIP–ctDNA
complex with different concentrations of SAIL for deintercalation
processes and confirmed the complete deintercalation of PIP from ctDNA
to SAIL micelle. On the addition of PIP, the CD spectrum of ctDNA
showed insignificant change at both the positive and negative bands
(Figure 14). This
signifies that PIP does not disturb the stacking of the nitrogen bases
and binds with ctDNA through groove binding. It is a known fact that
both the positive and negative bands of ctDNA are unaffected in groove
binding and show enormous change in the case of intercalative binding.67 This result is also identical to other experiments.
To confirm the complete deintercalation, we observed the CD spectrum
of PIP–ctDNA complex in the presence of different concentrations
of SAIL. Upon the addition of PIP, the positive ellipticity band of
ctDNA was slightly increased; however, after the addition of SAIL
in the PIP–ctDNA complex, the positive band decreased with
increasing SAIL concentration (Figure 14B). At above cmc concentration (35 mM),
the CD spectrum of the complex was overlapped with the CD spectrum
of ctDNA, which indicates that PIP relocates from ctDNA to the SAIL
micelle.3 Consequently, the CD result suggested
the complete deintercalation of PIP in the presence of the SAIL micelle.

3 Conclusions
Spontaneous interaction of ctDNA and PIP followed by the incorporation
of PIP in SAIL micelles and deintercalation of PIP from ctDNA in the
presence of SAIL micelles was successfully characterized by spectrophotometric
and surface tension method. Absorption and emission spectroscopy suggested
the involvement of minor groove binding between PIP and ctDNA complex
formation. Incorporation of PIP in the SAIL micelle is confirmed by
the change in spectra of both absorption and emission spectroscopy.
Last, the complex phenomenon of micelle-driven deintercalation was
established by the variation depicted in absorption and emission spectra
in the micellar environment, illustrating the relocation of the PIP
from ctDNA environment to the micellar environment. The locations
of PIP in different environments were determined by KI-induced fluorescence
quenching and steady-state fluorescence anisotropy, which confirm
the transfer of PIP. Surface tension studies were also utilized to
confirm the incorporation and deintercalation of PIP in SAIL, which
showed decreased cmc of PIP–SAIL from 31.35 (pure SAIL) to
25.30 mM, and a similar cmc was also found in deintercalation processes.
Time-resolved fluorescence and CD studies corroborate that PIP dissociated
from ctDNA to the SAIL micelle. The present research on deintercalation
process with SAIL provides imperative therapeutic significance through
controlled release of drug from the target cell in cancer therapy.

4 Experimental Section
Calf thymus deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA), PIP and SAIL (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium
octyl sulfate ([C4mim] [C8SO4])),
and phosphate salts (sodium monophosphate and biphosphate) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich Corporation and used without further purification.
ctDNA was prepared by dissolving in 10 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7.0
and stored in −20 °C. The intensity of the absorbance
maxima was measured at 260 and 280 nm to ensure the concentration
(molar extinction coefficients ε 6600 M–1 cm–1 at 260 nm) and purity of ctDNA. The A260/A280 ratios
were found to be 1.8, which confirmed that ctDNA samples were free
from protein. Millipore water was used during all conduct experiment.
Stock solution of PIP (5 mM) was prepared in 10% ethanolic solution,
and the concentration was determined by the measured absorbance at
342 nm using molar extinction coefficients (ε), 16 500
M–1 cm–1. The working solution
(50 μM) was prepared by diluting the solution through experimental
buffer solutions. The SAIL ([C4mim] [C8SO4]) was dissolved in water at a concentration of 400 mM (stock),
and the cmc of SAIL in water at room temperature was determined at
31.35 mM via surface tension experiments, which was approximately
similar to the previous reported data, that is, 34 mM.14

Analytik Jena Specord-210 spectrophotometer and Cary Eclipse fluorescence
spectrophotometer (Varian, USA) were used for the measurement of the
absorption and emission spectra, respectively. The time-correlated
single-photon counting spectrometer (Horiba, Jobin Yvon, IBH Ltd,
Glasgow, UK) was utilized to study the lifetime decay and dynamic
anisotropy. CD measurements have been performed on a Jasco-715 spectropolarimeter,
and for surface tension measurement, we utilized a high-precision
delta–pi Langmuir microtensiometer (Kibron, Hebsinki, Finland)
by Du-Nouy–Padday method. ITC measurements were performed on
a MicroCal VP-ITC unit (MicroCal, Inc., Northampton, MA). The technical
details are provided in the Supporting Information. The concentration of PIP was fixed 50 μM for all of the experiments
except ITC (500 μM). For PIP–SAIL interaction, we used
a constant concentration of PIP (50 μM) by gradually adding
SAIL (2–35 mM) below cmc to above cmc. For PIP–ctDNA
interaction, different concentrations of ctDNA (0.22–1.29 mM)
titrated in PIP (50 μM) and for deintercalation processes constant
PIP and ctDNA complex (1:25) was titrated with increasing SAIL concentration
(2–35 mM). More instrumental details of all of the used techniques
are provided in the Supporting Information.
