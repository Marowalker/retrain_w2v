The cytochrome P450/P450 reductase
fusion enzyme CYP505A30 from
the thermophilic fungus Myceliophthora thermophila and its heme (P450) domain were expressed in Escherichia
coli and purified using affinity, ion exchange, and
size exclusion chromatography. CYP505A30 binds straight chain fatty
acids (from ∼C10 to C20), with highest affinity for tridecanoic
acid (KD = 2.7 μM). Reduced nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide phosphate is the preferred reductant for CYP505A30
(KM = 3.1 μM compared to 330 μM
for reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide in cytochrome c reduction). Electron paramagnetic resonance confirmed
cysteine thiolate coordination of heme iron in CYP505A30 and its heme
domain. Redox potentiometry revealed an unusually positive midpoint
potential for reduction of the flavin adenine dinucleotide and flavin
mononucleotide cofactors (E0′ ∼
−118 mV), and a large increase in the CYP505A30 heme domain
FeIII/FeII redox couple (ca. 230 mV) on binding
arachidonic acid substrate. This switch brings the ferric heme iron
potential into the same range as that of the reductase flavins. Multiangle
laser light scattering analysis revealed CYP505A30’s ability
to dimerize, whereas the heme domain is monomeric. These data suggest
CYP505A30 may function catalytically as a dimer (as described for Bacillus megaterium P450 BM3), and that binding interactions
between CYP505A30 heme domains are not required for dimer formation.
CYP505A30 catalyzed hydroxylation of straight chain fatty acids at
the ω-1 to ω-3 positions, with a strong preference for
ω-1 over ω-3 hydroxylation in the oxidation of dodecanoic
and tetradecanoic acids (88 vs 2% products and 63 vs 9% products,
respectively). CYP505A30 has important structural and catalytic similarities
to P450 BM3 but distinct regioselectivity of lipid substrate oxidation
with potential biotechnological applications.

==== Body
Introduction
The cytochromes P450 are a superfamily
of heme-binding enzymes
found in virtually all organisms.1 They
are typically monooxygenases, catalyzing the oxidative scission of
dioxygen (O2) bound to their heme iron with the insertion
of one atom of oxygen into a substrate bound in their active site
and the other atom reduced to form a water molecule.2 Although often referred to as hydroxylases, P450s can also
catalyze a wide range of other reactions, including N-dealkylation, demethylation, sulfoxidation, dehydrogenation, reduction,
epoxidation, C–C bond formation, and decarboxylation.3−5 Human P450s play key roles in the transformation of xenobiotics
(e.g., pharmaceuticals and environmental toxins) to facilitate their
detoxification and excretion, and also in the biosynthesis and interconversion
of steroids.6,7 Microbial P450s have diverse roles,
including the catabolism of organic compounds as energy sources and
oxidative reactions in the synthesis of polyketides.8

Most of the cytochromes P450 require electron transfer
partners
to provide them with electrons that are ultimately derived from reduced
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) or reduced nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (NADH).9 Most P450s
fall into one of two major classes, based on their redox partner systems.
Class I P450s use a NAD(P)H-dependent, flavin-containing ferredoxin
reductase and an iron–sulfur cluster binding ferredoxin. The
class I P450s are usually membrane-bound in eukaryotes (e.g., adrenal
mitochondrial P450s involved in steroid biosynthesis) but are soluble
in prokaryotes (e.g., the camphor hydroxylase P450cam, CYP101A1).10,11 Class II P450s use a NADPH-dependent cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR)
redox partner that binds both flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and
flavin mononucleotide (FMN) cofactors. These are typified by mammalian
systems in the liver, where both the CPR and the P450s are bound to
the endoplasmic reticulum through a helical N-terminal
transmembrane anchor.12 P450s are characterized
by the proximal ligation of their heme b iron through
an invariant Cys thiolate, a residue essential for the monooxygenase
activity of P450s.13 A water molecule typically
occupies the distal site on the ferric heme iron in the resting state
of a P450. However, when a substrate binds, the distal water is displaced,
and is replaced by dioxygen once the heme iron is reduced to the ferrous
form. A further reduction step mediated by the redox partner converts
the ferrous–oxo form to the ferric–peroxo state, which
is then protonated in two consecutive steps, forming the reactive
intermediates compound 0 (ferric–hydroperoxo) and then compound
I (ferryl–oxo). Compound I is considered to be the major species
responsible for substrate oxidation in P450 enzymes.14

A particular group of P450 enzymes is exemplified
by the Bacillus megaterium P450 BM3
(CYP102A1, BM3), in
which the P450 (N-terminal) is fused to a CPR enzyme through a short
peptide linker region.15 BM3 was first
characterized by Armand Fulco’s group, who demonstrated that
the enzyme was soluble and that it acted as a highly efficient and
catalytically self-sufficient fatty acid hydroxylase, requiring only
NADPH and a lipid substrate for activity.16,17 BM3 was reported to catalyze oxidation of arachidonic acid with
a rate constant of >17 000 min–1.18 BM3 and P450cam are probably the best characterized
P450 enzymes, and both of these enzymes have been extensively engineered
to explore their catalytic mechanism and in efforts to diversify their
substrate selectivity. Recent protein engineering studies on BM3 have
produced variants capable of oxidizing alkanes and steroids, and of
producing metabolites of human drugs.19−21 The catalytic efficiency
of the P450 BM3 enzyme has made it a popular enzyme for synthetic
biology applications. However, B. megaterium is a mesothermophilic organism that grows optimally at ∼30
°C, and a lack of thermostability of the BM3 enzyme may thus
pose challenges for its application in synthetic biology. In particular,
FMN binding is relatively weak in BM3 in comparison to that of mammalian
CPR enzymes.22 In addition, a dimeric state
of BM3 is the catalytically relevant form of the enzyme, and the dimer
may also be destabilized at higher temperatures.23

In this report, we describe the identification, expression,
biochemical,
spectroscopic, kinetic, and catalytic properties of a novel, eukaryotic
P450–CPR fusion enzyme (CYP505A30) from the moderately thermophilic
fungus Myceliophthora thermophila,
an organism that grows optimally at ∼45–50 °C.24 The spectroscopic, biophysical, thermodynamic,
and kinetic properties of CYP505A30 are detailed to provide insights
into the catalytic properties of this novel member of the eukaryotic
CYP505 P450 family.

Results
CYP505A30 Amino Acid Sequence
and Phylogenetic Analysis
The M. thermophila CYP505A30 amino
acid sequence (Figure 1) reveals a protein of 1080 residues (including the initiator methionine)
that is closely related to other fungal members of the CYP505 family,
for example, the well characterized CYP505A1 (P450foxy from Fusarium oxysporum, 57% identity),25 and CYP505 family orthologues in Neurospora
crassa OR74A (64% identity) and in the saprophytic
fungus Chaetomium globosum CBS 148.51
(79.5% identity). P450foxy was shown to catalyze the hydroxylation
of decanoic acid (C10:0), undecanoic acid (C11:0), and dodecanoic
acid (C12:0) at the ω-1, ω-2, and ω-3 positions,
as was also reported for P450 BM3 by Fulco and co-workers for a number
of fatty acid substrates.26,27Figure 1 shows the amino acid alignment of CYP505A30
with the well-studied B. megaterium P450 BM3 (BM3, CYP102A1) and with three other members of the eukaryotic
CYP505 family, revealing conserved regions in these enzymes associated
with functions including heme, FAD, and FMN binding. Important conserved
residues in CYP505A3 include Phe93 (Phe87 in BM3) for regioselectivity
of substrate oxidation; Glu273/Thr274 (Glu267/Thr268) for protonation
of iron–oxo species in the P450 catalytic cycle; Cys411 (Cys400)
as the heme iron proximal ligand with Phe404 (Phe393) as a regulator
of heme iron potential; and Ser857/Cys1035/Asp1077 (Ser830/Cys999/Asp1044)
involved in NADPH binding/FAD cofactor reduction.15

Figure 1 Amino acid sequence of M. thermophila (CYP505A30) with related flavocytochrome enzymes. Amino acid alignment
of CYP505A30 was done using the Clustal Omega program via the European
Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) Web site (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/). CYP505A30 (Myceliophthora) was aligned with other CYP505 P450
family members from F. oxysporum (Fusarium—P450foxy,
CYP505A1), N. crassa (Neurospora),
and C. globosum (Chaetomium), and with
the B. megaterium P450 BM3/CYP102A1
(Bacillus). Residues Arg47/Tyr51 in BM3 are important for interactions
with the carboxylate of the fatty acid substrate, and have conservative
substitutions in the CYP505A1 (Lys/Phe) and N. crassa (Arg/Phe) P450 sequences (highlighted in red). BM3 Phe87 is part
of a DGLFT motif, that is, conserved in all of the aligned P450s.
Phe87 interacts with the terminal methyl group of fatty acid substrates
in BM3 and is important in regulating the regioselectivity of substrate
hydroxylation (highlighted in red).17 The
BM3 Glu267/Thr268 residues are important in interactions with and
proton transfer to iron–oxo intermediates in the P450 catalytic
cycle and are found in the center of a strongly conserved motif in
all of the P450s aligned (highlighted in red).54 The heme-binding motif is shown with gray shading. Highlighted
in red are the phylogenetically conserved Cys residues that act as
the proximal ligand to the heme iron and the conserved phenylalanines
located seven residues before the Cys. Studies in BM3 revealed that
mutations to Phe393 resulted in substantial changes to the heme iron
potential in the P450.55 Regions involved
in binding the FMN phosphate group and the FMN ring on its re-face and si-face, respectively, are
shown consecutively with yellow shading. Regions involved in binding
the FAD ring (si-face)/adenine moiety, the pyrophosphate
group, and the FAD ring (re-face) are also shown
consecutively with green shading. Regions involved in binding the
NADP(H) pyrophosphate group and the NADP(H) adenine group are also
shown consecutively with cyan shading.56,57 The six consecutive
glycine residues colored in red in the M. thermophila sequence (Gly486–Gly491) are located in the predicted interdomain
linker region between the P450 and P450 reductase domains. Flexible
linker peptides of varying sequence are predicted in this region for
each of these flavocytochromes. Also highlighted in red are BM3 residues
Ser830, Cys999, and Asp1044, which are a conserved “catalytic
triad” involved in NADP(H) binding and electron transfer to
the FAD cofactor.58,59

Figure 2 shows a
phylogenetic tree describing the relatedness of CYP505A30 to other
selected members of the CYP505 family, and to the B.
megaterium fatty acid hydroxylase BM3. Other bioinformatics
studies used the genome mining tool antiSMASH to identify secondary
metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters in M. thermophila.28 This analysis revealed that the CYP505A30 gene on chromosome 3 of M. thermophila is located directly adjacent to a type 1 polyketide synthase gene
cluster that is predicted to encode proteins required for production
of a monodictyphenone class (phenolic benzophenone) molecule. A near-identical
gene organization was found in Sclerotinia borealis, a psychrophilic plant pathogen. However, there is no evidence that
CYP505A30 is involved in polyketide synthesis in either organism.

Figure 2 Phylogenetic
tree of M. thermophila CYP505A30 and
related CYP505 family P450–CPR fusion enzymes.
The amino acid sequences of several selected members of the CYP505
family were aligned using the Clustal Omega program, and the image
was made using the program FigTree (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/). The CYP505A30 amino acid sequence aligns closely with CYP505A2
from N. crassa OR74A (64.3% identity),
and has 56.5% amino acid sequence identity with CYP505A5 from Magnaporthe grisea. CYP505* and CYP505A† proteins are P450 and P450–CPR fusions, respectively, identified
in the genome of the Thielavia terrestris fungus. CYP505A† protein has 73.5% identity with
CYP505A30.60 CYP505A30’s orthologue
from C. globosum is 79.5% identical
to CYP505A30.

Expression and Purification
of CYP505A30 and Its Heme Domain
CYP505A30 and its heme domain
were expressed in Escherichia coli and
purified as described in the Experimental Methods section. Typical recovery yields
were ∼15 mg/L of expression cell culture in the case of intact
CYP505A30, and ∼40 mg/L for the heme domain. Figure 3 shows sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gels demonstrating purification of
both CYP505A30 and its heme domain. The apparent molecular masses,
by comparison to protein standards, are ∼120 and ∼55
kDa for CYP505A30 and its heme domain, respectively. These are consistent
with the predicted masses from the protein amino acid sequences of
120.22 (CYP505A30) and 53.23 kDa (heme domain), including the N-terminal
hexahistidine tag region.

Figure 3 Purification of CYP505A30 and its heme domain.
CYP505A30 and its
heme domain were expressed in E. coli and purified as described in the Experimental Methods section. The SDS-PAGE gel on the left side shows molecular weight
markers in the first lane (Bio-Rad Precision Plus Unstained Standards
10–250 kDa) and fractions of the purified CYP505A30 heme domain
at ∼55 kDa in the lanes marked 1 and 2. In the adjacent SDS-PAGE
gel, the lanes marked 3 and 4 contain purified intact CYP505A30 at
∼120 kDa, with the final lane containing the same molecular
weight markers as before. The apparent masses of the two protein samples
correlate well with their predicted masses (53.23 kDa for the heme
domain and 120.22 kDa for intact CYP505A30).

UV–Visible Spectroscopic Properties of CYP505A30 and
Its Heme Domain
Figure 4 shows the UV–visible spectra for (i) the ligand-free,
oxidized (OX) CYP505A30, and for (ii) a sodium dithionite-reduced
form of CYP505A30. In the OX, ligand-free state, CYP505A30 has a typical
P450 absorption spectrum with the Soret maximum at 415 nm, and with
α- and β-bands in the visible region at ∼567 and
∼533 nm, respectively. There are also large CYP505A30 spectral
contributions arising from the OX FAD and FMN flavins in its reductase
domain between ∼450 and 510 nm, as well as a broad shoulder
(∼340–380 nm) on the opposite side of the heme Soret
band, which occludes the CYP505A30 heme delta band feature at ∼360
nm. Addition of limited amounts of dithionite bleaches the flavin
absorbance, indicating extensive reduction of the flavins. However,
there is not a substantial effect on the wavelength maximum of the
Soret band at ∼415 nm, suggesting that the heme does not become
significantly reduced under the conditions used and that the reduction
potential of the low-spin (LS), ferric CYP505A30 heme iron is considerably
more negative than those of the flavins. There is a small increase
in spectral intensity between ∼530 and 650 nm in the dithionite-reduced
enzyme, likely due to a proportion of the flavins being in the neutral
SQ state with an absorbance maximum at ∼600 nm.29,30

Figure 4 Reduction
of the flavin cofactors in the intact flavocytochrome
CYP505A30. A UV–visible spectrum is shown for a sample of intact
CYP505A3 (7.7 μM, solid line) with the Soret maximum at 415
nm and α/β bands at ∼566 and ∼534 nm, respectively.
Absorbance shoulders to either side of the Soret band arise from the
spectrum of the OX flavins in the protein (FAD and FMN). On reduction
of the sample with a small amount of sodium dithionite, the flavins
become near-fully reduced and their absorbance contribution is bleached
in the range from ∼370 to 520 nm (dashed line). Heme spectral
contributions are essentially unaffected, with the Soret maximum at
∼416 nm. These data indicate that the flavin reduction potentials
are considerably more positive than that of the substrate-free, ferric
CYP505A30 heme iron.

Figure 5A
shows
the UV–visible spectra for (i) the ligand-free, OX CYP505A30
heme domain, (ii) the sodium dithionite-reduced heme domain, (iii)
the heme domain bound to arachidonic acid and in a high-spin (HS)
form, (iv) the nitric oxide (NO) complex of the OX heme domain, and
(v) the ferrous/CO-bound form of the heme domain. The ferric heme
domain has a Soret maximum at 415 nm and the α- and β-bands
at 567 and 533 nm, respectively. The Reinheitszahl (Rz, A415/A280) value is ∼1.45
for the purified heme domain. On reduction of the heme domain with
a larger amount of dithionite than that which was used to reduce the
flavins in intact CYP505A30, the heme iron was fully reduced and the
Soret band shifted to 411 nm, with a single spectral feature in the
Q-band region at approximately 546 nm. The arachidonic acid substrate-bound
form has an absorbance maximum at 399 nm and is extensively HS. The
HS character is further confirmed by the development of an absorbance
band at ∼650 nm that is characteristic of a ferric heme iron-to-Cys
thiolate charge transfer (CT) complex. NO binding to the heme domain
resulted in a Soret shift to 434 nm, along with the development of
two prominent absorbance bands at 543 and 573 nm. The spectrum for
the CYP505A30 heme domain FeIII–NO complex is similar
to that reported previously for the P450 BM3 heme domain.31 On binding CO to the ferrous heme domain, a
characteristic shift of the Soret feature to 450 nm was seen, along
with the development of a single band at ∼550 nm in the Q-band
region. This spectrum is characteristic of a P450 FeII–CO
complex in which Cys thiolate is retained as the proximal ligand to
the heme iron.2

Figure 5 UV–visible spectroscopic
analysis of CYP505A30 and its heme
domain. Panel A shows the UV–visible spectra for the CYP505A30
heme domain; in its ferric resting state (thick solid line) with its
Soret maximum at 415 nm and the heme α- and β-bands at
567 and 533 nm, respectively. The sodium dithionite-reduced ferrous
form (dotted line) has its Soret maximum at 411 nm and a single visible
region absorbance band at 546 nm. The ferrous, CO-bound form (thin
solid line) has its Soret maximum at 450 nm and a visible band at
550 nm. The ferric heme NO-bound form (dashed line) has a Soret maximum
at 434 nm and visible region bands at 543 and 573 nm. The arachidonic
acid substrate-bound form (dashed and dotted line) shows extensive
conversion of the ferric heme iron to the HS form, with a Soret maximum
at 399 nm and visible region bands at ∼522 and ∼562
nm, with a further feature at ∼650 nm arising from a Cys thiolate-to-HS
ferric heme iron CT complex. For clarity, the visible region is also
shown at 5× magnification. Panel B (main image) shows a binding
titration of arachidonic acid to the heme domain. The substrate-free
heme domain (4.9 μM) is shown with a thick solid line. Thin
solid lines show selected spectra collected after stepwise additions
of arachidonic acid from a 10 mM stock, highlighting a LS to HS shift
in the heme iron spin-state equilibrium. The final spectrum (collected
at 7 μM arachidonic acid) is near-saturated with arachidonic
acid and has a Soret maximum at 399 nm (dashed line). Panel B (inset)
shows a plot of substrate-induced absorbance difference (peak minus
trough absorbance from difference spectra produced by subtraction
of the spectrum for the substrate-free heme domain from each consecutive
substrate-bound spectrum in the titration) against the relevant arachidonic
acid concentration. Each ΔAbs point is derived from the value
of the difference peak absorbance maximum (at 388 nm) minus the difference
trough absorbance minimum (at 417 nm). Data were fitted using the
Morrison equation, yielding KD = 0.12
± 0.01 μM for arachidonic acid. Panel C (main image) shows
spectral data for a titration of the intact CYP505A30 (thick solid
line, 4.6 μM) with the azole inhibitor drug bifonazole. A 10
mM bifonazole stock solution was used and the titration continued
to a final ligand concentration of 200 μM at which point the
near-saturating CYP505A3/bifonazole complex exhibited a diminished
Soret intensity with a maximum at 422 nm. Panel C (inset) shows a
plot of bifonazole-induced absorbance change vs bifonazole concentration. ΔAbs
data were generated as described for those in panel B. In this case,
the difference spectrum peak and trough values were at 431 and 411
nm. Data were fitted using the Michaelis−Menten function to
give KD = 69 ± 5 μM for bifonazole.

Analysis of the Binding
of the Flavin Cofactors to CYP505A30
The UV–visible
spectrum of intact CYP505A30 (Figure 4) is representative of several
preparations of this enzyme. The CYP505A30 flavin absorbance is relatively
more intense (compared to its heme absorbance) than is the case for
the well-studied flavocytochrome P450 BM3 enzyme, suggesting that
heme incorporation is substoichiometric in CYP505A30. In contrast,
the CYP505A30 heme domain showed a consistent level of heme incorporation,
corresponding to at least 90% heme content in the highly purified
samples. Previous studies on the P450 BM3 orthologues CYP102A2 and
CYP102A3 from Bacillus subtilis also
revealed substoichiometric heme incorporation in the case of the intact
flavocytochrome CYP102A2 when expressed in E. coli cells.32 To compare heme content with
those of the flavin cofactors, a 40 μM sample of CYP505A30,
quantified based on a heme extinction coefficient of ε418 = 105 mM–1 cm–1,18 was incubated at 90 °C for 10 min in buffer
B to release flavin cofactors from its reductase domain. The FAD and
FMN cofactors released were then resolved using high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) and their concentrations determined using HPLC
by reference to the peak areas of flavin (FAD and FMN) standards (Sigma-Aldrich),
as described in the Experimental Methods section.
Interpolation provided CYP505A30 flavin concentrations of 41.5 and
49 μM for FMN and FAD, respectively. These data are apparently
confirmatory of the substoichiometric binding of heme to CYP505A30,
particularly in view of the known tighter binding of FAD over that
of FMN in CPR enzymes. For example, FMN is more readily dissociated
from CPR by chaotropes than is FAD (e.g., by potassium bromide), and
the FMN KD values are 42 ± 7 and
86 ± 14 nM for the FMN (flavodoxin-like) domains of human and
P450 BM3 reductases, compared to, for example, 2.4 nM for Desulfovibrio vulgaris flavodoxin.33−36 FAD binding to rat CPR was reported
to be subnanomolar,37 and it is likely
that FAD binding is near-stoichiometric in CYP505A30, as this is the
larger of the flavins and has more interactions with the protein,
compared to FMN, through its additional adenosine monophosphate (AMP)
group. Thus, comparative analyses suggest that CYP505A30 heme binding
occurs up to only ∼80% stoichiometry, even with supplementation
of the heme precursor delta-aminolevulinic acid (ΔALA) in the
growth medium. FAD is likely to be stoichiometrically bound, whereas
purified CYP505A30 retains ∼85% FMN.

Substrate and Inhibitor
Binding to CYP505A30 and Its Heme Domain
As is consistent
with the properties of its bacterial homologue
P450 BM3 and its fungal orthologue P450foxy (CYP505A1), several medium
to long chain length fatty acids bind to CYP505A30 and its heme domain,
and in doing so displace the distal water ligand bound to the ferric
heme iron. This causes a LS to HS shift in the ferric heme iron spin-state
equilibrium, inducing a “type I” spectral shift characteristic
of substrate binding to P450 enzymes. On the binding of fatty acid
substrates to the CYP505A30/heme domain, the Soret maximum shifts
from 415 to ∼399 nm. There are alterations in the α/β-band
positions, as well as the development of a low intensity Cys thiolate-to-HS
ferric heme iron CT absorbance band at ∼651 nm. UV–visible
spectral binding titrations were done using several lipid substrates
and with both CYP505A30 and its heme domain. Figure 5B shows a spectral titration for the binding
of the substrate arachidonic acid to the CYP505A30 heme domain. The
inset shows a plot of arachidonic acid-induced absorbance change against
substrate concentration, with data fitted using Morrison’s
quadratic function for tight-binding ligands to give KD = 0.12 ± 0.01 μM.38 The Soret absorbance blueshift and the development of a CT species
are characteristic of HS heme iron formation in the substrate-bound
state. Table 1 shows
the compiled data for the binding of various fatty acid substrates
to CYP505A30 and its heme domain. These data reveal that several different
fatty acids bind tightly to these proteins and induce substantial
shifts in the heme iron spin-state equilibrium toward the HS form.

Methods section. The KD values
for the binding of saturated fatty acids (C10:0–C18:0), the
polyunsaturated fatty acid, arachidonic acid, and the N-acylamino acid, NPG, were determined by fitting of substrate-induced
heme absorbance change versus applied substrate concentration using
either a standard hyperbolic function or the Morrison equation for
tight-binding ligands.38 The extent of
HS heme iron accumulated is estimated to the nearest 5%. N.D. indicates
that a KD could not be accurately determined
due to weak spin-state shift.

Figure 5C shows
a CYP505A30 titration with the azole drug inhibitor bifonazole. There
is a Soret red shift from 415 to 423 nm that is consistent with the
distal coordination of the P450 heme iron through the available imidazole
nitrogen on bifonazole. The inset shows a plot of bifonazole-induced
absorbance change against inhibitor concentration, with data fitted
using a standard hyperbolic (Michaelis–Menten) equation to
give KD = 69.1 ± 4.6 μM. Similar
modes of CYP505A30 inhibition through distal coordination of the heme
iron were observed for other imidazole-based inhibitors, with the
following KD values: 723 ± 37 μM
(imidazole); 3.4 ± 0.2 μM (1-phenylimidazole); 12.7 ±
0.8 μM (4-phenylimidazole); and 10.0 ± 0.9 μM (econazole).

Redox Potentiometry Studies on CYP505A30 and Its Heme Domain
CYP505A30
Diflavin Reductase Potentiometry
To establish
the flavin midpoint reduction potentials for CYP505A30, spectroelectrochemical
titrations of both the substrate-free and the arachidonic acid-bound
forms of the intact CYP505A30 enzyme and its heme domain were carried
out as described in the Experimental Methods section. Initial studies involved a titration of intact CYP505A30
with dithionite reductant in the range from approximately +175 to
−210 mV versus the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE). Essentially
complete flavin reduction was observed with negligible heme reduction
in the same potential range. The heme Soret maximum remained at 415
nm, with no evidence of change in the position of the α- and
β-bands (Figure 6A). A plot of the absorbance change at 460 nm against the applied
potential revealed an apparent single transition, without any obvious
inflexions. This suggested that the reduction potentials for the FMN
and FAD OX/semiquinone (SQ) and SQ/hydroquinone (HQ) transitions are
in the same range. The data were fitted using the Nernst equation
to give an apparent flavin (FAD and FMN) midpoint potential of E0′ = −118 ± 2 mV for the
complete, four-electron reduction of both flavins that occurs in the
range between ∼−50 and −180 mV versus NHE (Figure 6B). The near-stoichiometric
binding of the flavins to CYP505A30 (∼1:0.85, FAD/FMN) determined
earlier in this study is also consistent with both FAD and FMN being
bound and having similar redox potentials. Further examination of
the spectra shown in Figure 6A revealed a flavin isosbestic point at ∼525 nm and
small increases in flavin absorbance from ∼530 to 690 nm. Flavin
absorbance in the 600 nm range is typical of blue (neutral) flavin
SQs, suggesting that one or both of the flavins may form a blue SQ
during the course of the redox titration. Figure 6C shows a plot of A600 versus applied potential, showing a biphasic increase and
then decrease in flavin absorbance in the range between ∼−50
and −200 mV versus NHE. Although the A600 change is small, it is consistent with a proportion of
the flavins undergoing single electron reduction to the blue SQ form,
followed by their further reduction to a neutral HQ form at more negative
potentials. Although the A600 absorbance
data are affected to an extent by small increases in solution turbidity
toward the end of the titration, it is still possible to fit the data
using a two-electron Nernst function, yielding a potential for the
OX/SQ transition of E0′ = −118
± 8 mV, whereas the potential for the incomplete SQ/HQ transition
can be estimated at approximately −180 ± 15 mV versus
NHE.39 Although the identity of the flavin
or flavins populating the SQ state is not clear, it appears most likely
that FAD should form this species. This is in view of the ability
of the FAD cofactor in P450 BM3 to stabilize a blue SQ in this enzyme,
whereas a transient red (anionic) SQ is formed by the BM3 FMN cofactor.40

Figure 6 Determination of flavin redox potentials in CYP505A30.
Panel A
shows the UV–visible spectral data for a redox titration of
intact, substrate-free CYP505A30 with dithionite reductant in the
potential range from ∼+175 to −210 mV vs NHE. The thick
solid line is the spectrum from the fully OX enzyme, with a dashed
line indicating the final spectrum collected in which the FAD and
FMN cofactors are near-completely reduced to their HQ states. Thin
solid lines show selected spectra collected during the course of the
titration. The heme spectrum remains largely unaffected in this redox
potential range, indicating that the heme FeIII/FeII reduction potential is lower (more negative) than those
of the flavins. Panel B shows a fit of absorbance data at 460 nm vs
applied potential, with data fitted using the Nernst equation to give
an apparent midpoint potential of E0′
= −118 ± 2 mV for the complete reduction of both flavin
cofactors. Panel C shows a fit of absorbance data at 600 nm (a wavelength
characteristic for neutral [blue] flavin SQs) vs applied potential,
with data fitted using a two-electron Nernst equation. These data
show that there is a small amount of blue SQ formed by single electron
flavin reduction. At more negative potentials the SQ is further reduced
toward the HQ form, which has no absorbance at 600 nm. Data fitting
gives estimates of E0′OX/SQ = −118 ± 8 mV and E0′SQ/HQ = −180 ± 15 mV.

CYP505A30 Heme Domain Potentiometry
The reduction potential
for the heme iron was determined for the isolated heme domain of CYP505A30
using both the substrate-free and arachidonic acid-bound forms of
the protein. On reductive titration of the substrate-free heme domain,
the Soret maximum shifts from 415 to ∼406 nm and broadens with
a partial “merging” of the α- and β-bands,
which shift to approximately 559 and 536 nm, respectively. A shoulder
appears at ∼430 nm for the Soret feature in its reduced form.
These data are consistent with the near-complete reduction of the
heme iron, but suggest that the distal coordination of the heme iron
may occur through both Cys thiol and Cys thiolate axial ligands. Data
fitting for the substrate-free heme domain was done using the Nernst
equation, giving the reduction potential for the heme FeIII/FeII couple as −298 ± 5 mV versus NHE, as
described in Experimental Methods (Figure 7A, inset).

Figure 7 Measurement
of heme iron potentials in the substrate-bound and
substrate-free forms of the CYP505A30 heme domain. Panel A (main image)
shows selected UV–visible spectra collected during a redox
titration of the arachidonic acid-bound form of the CYP505A30 heme
domain. The thick solid line shows the spectrum of the OX, substrate-bound
heme domain with a Soret maximum at 399 nm, and α- and β-bands
at ∼563 and 522 nm, respectively. The dashed line shows the
spectrum for the reduced heme domain, with the Soret band shifted
to 413 nm, a single feature in the Q-band region at ∼550 nm,
and the loss of an HS CT signal at ∼650 nm. Selected spectra
collected during the titration are shown in thin solid lines. Data
fitting using the Nernst equation gives a FeIII/FeII heme iron midpoint potential of E0′ = −69 ± 3 mV (panel B, filled triangles). Panel
A (inset) shows selected spectra from a redox titration of the substrate-free
heme domain. The spectra for the OX and reduced forms are shown as
thick solid and dashed lines, respectively. Other selected spectra
collected during the titration are shown as thin solid lines. The
Soret band shifts from 415 to ∼406 nm on heme iron reduction
with partial merging of the α- and β-bands and small peak
shifts to ∼559 and 536 nm, respectively. Data fitting as above
gives a midpoint potential of E0′
= −298 ± 5 mV for the substrate-free heme domain (panel
B, filled circles).

In the case of the arachidonic
acid-bound form of the heme domain,
the spectrum of the ferric protein is clearly indicative of an extensively
HS P450 with a Soret maximum at 399 nm, and with α- and β-bands
at approximately 563 and 522 nm, respectively (Figure 7A, main panel). Reductive titration of the
substrate-bound heme iron results in a Soret shift to 413 nm. Reduction
of the substrate-bound heme iron also results in the loss of the signal
originating from the CT complex observed at ∼650 nm in the
OX state, and in the development of a single Q-band feature at approximately
550 nm. The midpoint potential for the substrate-bound CYP505A30 heme
domain was determined by fitting absorbance data at 390 nm using the
Nernst equation. The data indicated a substantial increase in heme
iron potential for the arachidonic acid-bound heme domain to −69
± 3 mV versus NHE. These data demonstrate a large elevation of
the heme iron redox potential of 229 mV (from −298 mV) on binding
to the substrate. The redox data plots for the substrate-free and
arachidonic acid-bound forms of the CYP505A30 heme domain are shown
in Figure 7B. Substrate
binding induces a much larger heme iron potential shift than what
was observed for the arachidonic acid-bound form of P450 BM3 (ca.
130 mV).39 In the case of the BM3 heme
domain, arachidonic acid binding raises the heme iron reduction potential
from −368 ± 6 to −239 ± 6 mV versus NHE. In
so doing, it elevates the heme iron potential above that of the electron
donor NADPH (−320 mV vs NHE) and into the range where electron
transfer from the CPR partner FMN-binding domain can occur.39 Although the redox potentials in CYP505A30 are
rather different from those in P450 BM3, the substantial elevation
of the heme iron reduction potential that occurs in the arachidonic
acid-bound CYP505A30 heme domain has a similar effect to that observed
from its binding in BM3. The apparent overall midpoint potential for
the flavins in CYP505A30 is ∼−120 mV versus NHE, making
electron transfer to the arachidonic acid-bound heme domain (E0′ = −69 mV) thermodynamically
favorable. Alterations to the CYP505A30 heme structure/environment
likely contribute to the large change in CYP505A30 heme iron potential
on arachidonic acid binding, and further insights may be obtained
through structural analysis of the heme domain.

Stopped-Flow
Analysis of Flavin Reduction in CYP505A30
Stopped-flow absorbance
data were collected at 475 nm to follow the
reduction of the flavins in CYP505A30 at 10 °C. The final NADH/NADPH
concentrations used were in the range from 60 to 1200 μM. Flavin
absorbance change versus time data were fitted accurately in both
cases using a single exponential function. The kinetics of flavin
reduction were faster with NADPH than that of those with NADH, as
is also the case with BM3.41 In the case
of NADPH, there was little variation in the rate constant across the
[NADPH] range up to 1.2 mM (kobs = 82.4
± 9.1 s–1), suggesting a high affinity for
NADPH. However, there was a hyperbolic dependence of kobs on [NADH], giving a limiting rate constant of klim = 42.0 ± 3.2 s–1 and
an apparent KD for NADH of 816 ±
113 μM when data were fitted using a hyperbolic function (Figure 8).

Figure 8 Stopped-flow kinetic
studies on CYP505A30. Kinetics of flavin reduction
in intact CYP505A30 were analyzed using stopped-flow absorbance spectroscopy.
Experiments were done using a range of NADPH and NADH concentrations,
and by rapidly mixing NAD(P)H with samples of OX CYP505A30 in the
stopped-flow instrument. Data were collected at 475 nm, following
the kinetics of flavin reduction through decreasing A475 vs time after mixing, with data fitted accurately
using a single exponential function. There was little variation in
the observed rate constants for flavin reduction (kobs) at different NADPH concentrations in the range up
to 1.2 mM (filled inverted triangles) with an average rate constant
of 82.3 ± 9.1 s–1. With NADH as the reductant,
the rate constants were lower and there was a hyperbolic dependence
of kobs on NADH concentration (filled
circles). These data were fitted using a hyperbolic (Michaelis–Menten)
function to yield a limiting rate constant of klim = 42.0 ± 3.2 s–1 and an apparent KD for NADH of 816 ± 113 μM.

Compared to those of the B. megaterium BM3 enzyme, the kinetics of flavin
reduction in CYP505A30 are much
slower. Reduction of the P450 BM3 flavins was previously reported
to be biphasic, with apparent rate constants of k1 = 758.4 ± 5.9 s–1 and k2 = 117.6 ± 2.4 s–1 at
25 °C.41 To examine the influence
of temperature on flavin reduction in CYP505A30, further CYP505A30
stopped-flow flavin reduction experiments were done at 5 °C temperature
intervals between 10 and 35 °C, using 1 mM NADPH. Data were again
fitted using a single exponential function. These data revealed an
apparent linear dependence of the kobs flavin reduction rate constant in this temperature range, with a
gradient of 14.5 ± 1.5 s–1 °C–1. The highest rate constant obtained was 441 ± 11 s–1 at 35 °C.

Spectroscopic Analysis of CYP505A30 and Its
Heme Domain Using
Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR)
EPR Analysis of the CYP505A30
Ferric Heme Iron in Substrate-Free
and Substrate-Bound States
EPR spectra were collected as
described in the Experimental Methods section. Figure 9 shows the EPR spectra
for the substrate-free and substrate (arachidonic acid)-bound forms
of CYP505A30 and its heme domain. The substrate-free and arachidonic
acid-bound CYP505A30 (upper two spectra) show g-values
typical of a ligand-free, LS, ferric P450 with cysteinate and water
axial ligands (gz = 2.41, gy = 2.24, and gx = 1.92).42 The arachidonic acid-bound CYP505A30 spectrum
has identical g-values to the substrate-free sample,
indicating a near-completely LS ferric heme at the cryogenic temperatures
(10 K) required for heme EPR, and despite its HS nature at ambient
temperature. Both EPR spectra reveal a derivative feature at g = ∼2.004 corresponding to a flavin SQ contribution.

Figure 9 EPR analysis
of CYP505A30 and its heme domain. X-band EPR spectroscopy
was used to characterize ferric heme iron coordination in CYP505A30
and its heme domain in both their substrate-free and arachidonic acid-bound
forms. The data show rhombic signals typical for LS P450s in which
Cys thiolate and water (or hydroxide) are the axial ligands to the
ferric heme iron, with g-values of gz = 2.41/2.42, gy = 2.24/2.25,
and gx = 1.92. Minor features at g = 8.01/8.03 likely indicate small components of HS ferric
heme iron retained in the CYP505A30 heme domain samples at the 10
K operating temperature. The small g = 3.50 signal
is assigned to free ferric iron, with the g = 2.00
signal arising from a proportion of flavin SQ in the substrate-bound
and substrate-free forms of intact CYP505A30.

The EPR spectra for the substrate-free and arachidonic acid-bound
heme domains (lower two spectra) are also shown in Figure 9 for comparison to that of
CYP505A30. These heme domains have similar g-values
to the intact CYP505A30 enzyme samples (gz = 2.42/2.41, gy = 2.25, and gx = 1.92), though with some minor “splitting”
of the gz signal, suggesting subtle structural
changes in the heme iron environment between the heme domain and the
intact flavocytochrome CYP505A30. The absence of a minor flavosemiquinone
signal in the heme domain samples is consistent with the absence of
a reductase domain in this construct, and with the positive reduction
potentials of the flavins reported earlier in this article. There
is a small HS gz signal at 8.01 (substrate-free
heme domain) and a slightly larger gz signal
at 8.03 (arachidonic acid-bound heme domain), which may indicate that
these heme domains retain a small proportion of HS, thiolate-coordinated
heme iron at 10 K. The signal at g = 3.50 is assigned
to free ferric iron, and the g = 2.00 signal in the
intact CYP505A30 protein is assigned to a flavin SQ component (likely
on the FAD cofactor).

EPR Characterization of a Flavin SQ Species
in CYP505A30
Anionic and neutral flavin SQs have identical g-factors
(2.004 in this case) but can be differentiated by their Gaussian split,
which is the difference in the line width in G between the SQ maximum
and the minimum in the first derivative presentation.43 A 15 G line width is characteristic of an anionic, red
SQ, whereas a 19 G line width is characteristic of a neutral blue
SQ. Intermediate values are usually indicative of a mixture of the
two species. In studies of P450 BM3, Murataliev et al. demonstrated
from EPR analysis that an NADPH-reduced, active form of P450 BM3 contained
both anionic (FMN) and neutral (FAD) SQ species with an SQ line width
of 15.7 G. An active form of BM3 in steady-state turnover with NADPH
had a value of 16.8 G, again consistent with the presence of both
anionic and neutral flavin SQs. However, an inactive form of NADPH-reduced
BM3 had a value of 19.2 G, indicating that only a blue SQ (on the
FAD) was present, whereas FMN was reduced to a HQ state inefficient
in reducing the heme iron.44 Subsequent
studies provided evidence for the role of a transient FMN anionic
SQ in BM3 heme iron reduction using a stopped-flow kinetics approach.40

To examine the formation of SQ species
in CYP505A30, enzyme samples (190 μM) were incubated with NADPH
(2 mM) for periods of 30 s, 5 min, and 10 min prior to freezing for
X-band EPR analysis. Figure 10 shows the SQ species formed at these time intervals. After
30 s of incubation with NADPH the line width is 16.3 G, indicative
of a mixture of blue/red SQ species. After 5 min of incubation a value
of 16.8 G was obtained, and after 10 min of incubation the line width
is 19.0 G. The transition with time from a mixture of blue/red SQ
species in CYP505A30 to a form with only a blue SQ is similar to the
data presented by Murataliev et al., and suggests that the mechanism
of electron transfer through the flavins may be similar in BM3 and
CYP505A30.44 Specifically, both enzymes
may undergo a 0–2–1–0 cycle where the digits
indicate the number of electrons on the CPR flavins. The reduction
of FAD occurs by hydride transfer from NADPH and places two electrons
on the cofactor. One of these is rapidly transferred to form an FMN
anionic HQ, leaving a neutral SQ on FAD. The FMN HQ reduces the heme
iron, and this event occurs again after a single electron transfer
from FAD to FMN. The consecutive single electron transfers from FMN-to-heme
enable (i) the binding of dioxygen to the ferrous/substrate-bound
P450 heme iron, and (ii) the further single electron reduction of
the resultant ferric–superoxo species in the P450 catalytic
cycle, facilitating the later production of highly reactive iron–oxo
species that oxidize the substrate.

Figure 10 EPR analysis of flavosemiquinone formation
in CYP505A30. The figure
shows EPR data collected for samples of CYP505A30 (190 μM) incubated
with NADPH (2 mM) for periods of 30 s, 5 min, and 10 min prior to
freezing in liquid nitrogen and X-band EPR analysis at 77 K. Flavosemiquinone
signals occurred in each sample. The 30 s sample (thick line) has
the highest SQ content and a SQ spectral line width of 16.3 G. The
5 min sample has a line width of 16.8 G and that of the 10 min sample
was 19.0 G. These data are consistent with the presence of a mixture
of anionic (red) and neutral (blue) SQs in the initial sample, but
then a time-dependent progression toward the final sample, which is
dominated by a neutral SQ signal. This most likely occurs due to the
time-dependent reduction of an FMN anionic SQ to its HQ form, whereas
the FAD cofactor retains a blue SQ species, as seen in the P450 BM3
enzyme.44

Steady-State Kinetic Analysis of Substrate Turnover by CYP505A30
Steady-State
Kinetics of Fatty Acid-Dependent NADPH Oxidation
by CYP505A30
The kcat and KM parameters for CYP505A30 in reactions with
a range of fatty acids were determined by measuring substrate-dependent
NADPH oxidation spectrophotometrically at 340 nm. These data are presented
in Table 1, and Figure 11 shows examples
of steady-state kinetic data for the CYP505A30-dependent oxidation
of NADPH with tetradecanoic and pentadecanoic acid substrates. The kcat values determined range from 1.2 to 7.5
s–1 (72–450 min–1), with Km values in the range from 7.7 to 21.2 μM.
The second-order rate constants (kcat/KM) reveal that catalytic efficiency is highest
with pentadecanoic acid (C15:0, kcat/KM = 0.96 μM–1 s–1). Arachidonic acid has a kcat of 2.0 ± 0.1 s–1 and a Km of 9.2 ± 0.5 μM (kcat/KM = 0.21 μM–1 s–1). Although there is good affinity for the
fatty acids tested, the kcat values are
much lower than those in P450 BM3 for the same substrates under similar
conditions (e.g., kcat = 285 ± 32
s–1 for arachidonic acid and kcat = 30.8 ± 1.5 s–1 for myristic acid).17,18 Our stopped-flow data for the temperature-dependence of the CYP505A30
flavin reduction indicate that the relevant rate constant increases
considerably as temperature is elevated up to 35 °C, and this
may also result in stimulation of the rate of fatty acid oxidation.
However, other data point to relatively modest thermostability in
CYP505A30 (see Thermostability of CYP505A30 and
Its Heme Domain section). Under the same conditions and in
the absence of lipid substrate addition, CYP505A30 oxidizes NADPH
with a rate constant of ∼5 min–1.

Figure 11 Steady-state
kinetics of CYP505A30. Steady-state kinetic data were
collected for CYP505A30 with a number of lipid substrates, as described
in the Experimental Methods section. The graphs
in panels A and B show steady-state data collected for fatty acid
substrate-dependent NADPH oxidation with tetradecanoic acid (C14:0)
and pentadecanoic acid (C15:0) substrates. Rate constants were determined
as the statistical average of three replicates at each concentration
of the substrate, with measurements of initial rates done by monitoring
NADPH consumption spectrophotometrically at 340 nm (ε340 = 6.21 mM–1 cm–1). Data points
are shown with standard deviation error bars, and data were fitted
using the Michaelis–Menten equation to give kcat and KD values of 1.21
± 0.1 s–1 and 7.7 ± 1.9 μM for tetradecanoic
acid, and of 7.5 ± 0.7 s–1 and 7.8 ± 2.1
μM for pentadecanoic acid, respectively.

Steady-State Kinetics of CYP505A30-Catalyzed Electron Transfer
to Cytochrome c and Ferricyanide
The apparent kcat values for fatty acid-dependent NADPH oxidation
in CYP505A30 are relatively slow at 25 °C (≤7.5 s–1, depending on the fatty acid) (Table 1). However, stopped-flow studies indicate
that NADPH-dependent reduction of the CYP505A30 flavin cofactors is
considerably faster (klim is ∼82
s–1 at 10 °C, rising to ∼250 s–1 at 25 °C). To establish the efficiency of electron transfer
from NADPH through the CYP505A30 flavins and onto electron acceptor
molecules, we undertook steady-state kinetic studies using potassium
ferricyanide (FeCN) and cytochrome c as substrates.
Cytochrome c has been recognized as an excellent
substrate for CPR enzymes, with electron transfer mediated through
the FMN cofactor. FeCN reduction may occur through either flavin.
However, the FAD/NADPH binding domain of BM3 was shown to be an excellent
catalyst of FeCN reduction in its own right (kcat = 360 ± 4 s–1 at 25 °C), indicating
that electron transfer to FeCN through the FAD is likely to be the
most efficient route.45 CYP505A30 catalyzed
FeCN reduction with kcat = 38.4 ±
1.8 s–1, KM(NADPH) =
2.9 ± 0.4 μM, and KM(FeCN) =
48.2 ± 0.4 μM. The comparable parameters for cytochrome c are kcat = 29.7 ± 0.7
s–1, KM(NADPH) = 3.1
± 0.4 μM, and KM(cyt c) = 79.3 ± 10.3 μM. The KM(NADH) values in studies of the NADH-driven reduction
of FeCN and cytochrome c by CYP505A30 were substantially
higher than those for NADPH (265 ± 38 and 330 ± 56 μM,
respectively), although the kcat values
were very similar to those obtained with NADPH as the electron donor
(34.3 ± 2.4 and 29.5 ± 2.4 s–1, respectively).
These data confirm that NADPH is the favored electron donor (the apparent
binding constant [KM] value is ∼100-fold
lower for NADPH than for NADH). However, the kcat values for CYP505A30-catalyzed cytochrome c and FeCN reduction are approximately 7.5-fold and 3.8-fold slower
than the respective rate constants for the BM3 enzyme under similar
conditions.45

Thermostability
of CYP505A30 and Its Heme Domain
M. thermophila grows optimally in the temperature
range from 45 to 50 °C. To probe the thermostability of the enzyme,
differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) was used, as described in
the Experimental Methods section, and a diverse
buffer set was used to identify conditions that best stabilized CYP505A30
and it heme domain. DSF was done using a SYPRO Orange dye as a reporter
of protein unfolding, and by ramping the temperature from 20 to 90
°C in 0.2 °C increments following 5 s delays for signal
stabilization at each temperature. In all cases, DSF analysis resulted
in a sigmoidal (two-state) transition between folded and unfolded
states with no evidence of any metastable intermediates during the
process. For both CYP505A30 and the heme domain, the highest Tm values were found using sodium/potassium phosphate
at pH 7.0, at 58.0 and 48.0 °C, respectively (from Tm values in the range 41.2–58.0 °C for CYP505A30
and 43.3–48.0 °C for the heme domain). These data indicate
that the heme domain expressed in isolation is less thermostable than
the intact CYP505A30 enzyme. Possible explanations for this phenomenon
are that the reductase domain of CYP505A30 stabilizes the linked domain,
or that CYP505A30 forms a dimer that stabilizes the heme domain. In
the latter case, there is a precedent for the dimerization of the
flavocytochrome P450 BM3 and for the BM3 dimer being the catalytically
relevant state of this enzyme.23,46 In further studies
of the stability of CYP505A30, the thermal stability of its FeII–CO complex was assessed by recording spectral changes
associated with the conversion from the P450 (Cys thiolate-coordinated)
to the P420 (Cys thiol-coordinated) form as temperature was ramped
between 25 and 60 °C in 2.5 °C increments. The Tm value for the P450-to-P420 transition occurred at ∼43
°C, with evidence of aggregation of the protein at temperatures
above 55 °C. These data again point to modest thermostability
of CYP505A30, with formation of the P420 state associated with loss
of catalytic activity in the P450 enzymes.

Analysis of the Quaternary
Structure of CYP505A30 and Its Heme
Domain Using Multiangle Laser Light Scattering (MALLS)
Intact
CYP505A30 has a predicted molecular mass of 119 377.4 Da (121 540.7
Da including the N-terminal His-tag), and the heme domain has a mass
of 52 514.5 Da (54 677.8 Da including the His-tag).
MALLS was used to ascertain the oligomerization status of both proteins.
In the case of intact CYP505A30 (Figure 12A), the data reveal two major species at
∼11.4 and 12.4 mL with masses of approximately 225 and 130
kDa, respectively—suggesting that monomeric and dimeric forms
of the flavocytochrome CYP505A30 exist in equilibrium under the conditions
used, and that the dimer (as in the case for the P450 BM3 flavocytochrome)
may be the catalytically relevant form of the enzyme.23,46 A minor species (approximately 80 kDa, eluting at ∼14 mL)
may result from partial degradation of the enzyme, and the void volume
of the column is at ∼8 mL. Figure 12B shows a rerun of a sample of the heme
domain, eluting at ∼16.5 mL. The predicted mass is ∼50
kDa, consistent with the heme domain of CYP505A30 being monomeric,
as is also the case for the P450 BM3 heme domain.46

Figure 12 MALLS studies of CYP505A30 and its heme domain. MALLS
was used
to analyze the aggregation state of CYP505A30 and its heme domain.
Panel A shows the MALLS data for the intact CYP505A30. Two major species
are seen at elution volumes of ∼11.4 and 12.4 mL, with corresponding
masses of ∼225 and 130 kDa, respectively. These correlate reasonably
well with the predicted masses of the dimeric and monomeric forms
of CYP505A30, and suggest that the CYP505A30 dimer may be the catalytically
relevant form of the enzyme, as is seen for P450 BM3.23 A peak for the void volume of the column is seen at ∼8
mL. Panel B shows the MALLS data for the heme domain with an elution
volume of ∼16.5 mL and a predicted mass of ∼50 kDa.
These data are consistent with the mass of the monomeric form of the
heme domain, indicating that this domain does not self-aggregate and
that the intact CYP505A30 dimer does form as a consequence of interactions
between the heme domains of the enzyme.

Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (GC–MS) Analysis
of Fatty Acid Hydroxylation
CYP505A30-mediated oxidation
reactions of lauric acid and myristic acid were done using a NADPH
regeneration system to facilitate efficient enzymatic oxidation of
these fatty acid substrates. Products were derivatized and resolved
by GC–MS, as described in the Experimental
Methods section. Figure 13A shows data from the reaction of CYP505A30 with lauric
acid (C12:0), showing the resolution of three product peaks corresponding
to the ω-1, ω-2, and ω-3 hydroxylated lauric acid
products, with retention times (RTs) of 8.94, 8.87, and 8.76 min,
respectively. A proportion of unconverted lauric acid is also seen
at 7.65 min. The hydroxylated products are in the proportions of approximately
88% (ω-1), 10% (ω-2), and 2% (ω-3). Figure 13B,C shows product fragmentation
data to identify the ω-1 and ω-2 hydroxylauric acid products,
respectively. A similar outcome was observed using myristic acid (C14:0)
as the substrate, with proportions of hydroxylated product of approximately
63% (ω-1), 28% (ω-2), and 9% (ω-3). It is clear
that hydroxylation is preferred at the ω-1 position for these
saturated fatty acids. A similar behavior was reported for P450 BM3
with these substrates, with the ω-1 product (48%) being dominant
over the ω-2 and ω-3 products (48, 26, and 26%, respectively)
with lauric acid, and a similar outcome observed with myristic acid
(58, 21, and 21%, respectively).47 The
most notable difference in the behaviors of CYP505A30 and P450 BM3
with these substrates is that there are substantially more ω-1
hydroxylated products formed by CYP505A30 compared to those by P450
BM3, and considerably less ω-3 hydroxylated products. Although
further studies are needed to provide a more complete analysis of
the fatty acid oxidation properties of CYP505A30, these initial data
suggest important differences with P450 BM3. In particular, fatty
acid hydroxylation at ω-1 appears to predominate for CYP505A30
with lauric and myristic acid, however there is relatively little
hydroxylation at the ω-1 position. Coupling of NADPH oxidation
to hydroxylated product formation was ∼80–85% for both
substrates.

Figure 13 GC–MS analysis of fatty acid oxidation by CYP505A30.
Catalytic
reactions were done using both dodecanoic (lauric) acid and tetradecanoic
(myristic) acid as substrates, using NADPH to drive CYP505A30-dependent fatty acid hydroxylation.
Any remaining substrate and the hydroxylated products were isolated
and derivatized as described in the Experimental
Methods section. Panel A shows a gas chromatogram of the hydroxylated
products formed from dodecanoic acid. Peaks are labeled indicating
ω-1 (RT = 8.94 min), ω-2 (RT = 8.87 min), or ω-3
(RT = 8.76 min) hydroxylation positions on the dodecanoic acid chain.
The remaining nonhydroxylated dodecanoic acid substrate has an RT
= 7.65 min. Panel B shows the mass spectrum of the peak with RT =
8.94 min, corresponding to the derivatized ω-1 hydroxylated
product (11-hydroxydodecanoic acid). Panel C shows the mass spectrum
of the peak with RT = 8.76 min, corresponding to the derivatized ω-2
hydroxylated product (10-hydroxydodecanoic acid). Relevant molecular
masses are indicated on the hydroxylated dodecanoic acid product structures
and on the mass spectra shown in panels B and C.

Discussion
In this study, we report the identification,
expression, and characterization
of CYP505A30, a member of the CYP505A family of cytochrome P450 enzymes
for which CYP505A1 (P450foxy from the ascomycete fungus F. oxysporum) is the founding member.25 Studies presented in this article demonstrate
that M. thermophila CYP505A30 is a
fatty acid binding and hydroxylating enzyme, sharing similar catalytic
properties to those exhibited by CYP505A1 and by the well characterized B. megaterium P450 BM3 (CYP102A1) enzyme. All three
of these enzymes are natural fusions of a cytochrome P450 to a CPR,
enabling them to be catalytically self-sufficient, requiring only
NADPH and fatty acid substrates for catalytic activity.16,25 Both the intact CY505A30 enzyme and its heme (P450) domain were
expressed and purified using an E. coli expression system, mimicking work previously done for the P450 BM3
enzyme.42,48 Both constructs produced functional entities
in terms of fatty acid substrate binding with associated HS ferric
heme iron accumulation (Figure 5 and Table 1), and the intact CYP505A30 catalyzed efficient fatty acid substrate-dependent
NADPH oxidation, in addition to reduction of cytochrome c and ferricyanide (Figures 11 and 13). MALLS analysis demonstrated
that the heme domain was predominantly monomeric in solution, and
the intact CYP505A30 showed the presence of both monomeric and dimeric
forms (Figure 12).
Previous studies showed that the related P450 BM3 enzyme dimerizes,
and that its dimeric form is likely to be the catalytically active
form,23 and we propose that the dimeric
form is also the state relevant to fatty acid oxidation in CYP505A30.
In the absence of addition of the heme precursor ΔALA, CYP505A30
is produced with substoichiometric heme content, typically resulting
in preparations with a dark orange color. However, heme content is
increased by expression cell growth in the presence of ΔALA
and the protein color is red. It is possible that the heme-free form
of CYP505A30 has lower propensity for dimerization, leading to an
increased population of the monomeric state as seen in the MALLS studies.
Other studies on the related F. oxysporum CYP505A1 (P450foxy) enzyme expressed in E. coli reported that FAD and FMN content in the reductase domain was low
(15 and 65% occupancy, respectively).25 In contrast, flavin incorporation was considerably higher in the M. thermophila CYP505A30 (∼85% FMN and near-100%
FAD incorporation).

Both intact CYP505A30 and its heme domain
bind tightly to a range
of different saturated fatty acids in the range from C10 to C20, in
addition to arachidonic acid (C20:4) and NPG, in which palmitic acid
(C16:0) is linked to the amino acid glycine through an amide bond.
The binding constants for several lipids were determined by UV–visible
absorbance titrations, revealing that all substrates had KD values in the range from 2.7 to 21.1 μM for the
intact CYP505A30, and from 0.12 to 9.0 μM for the heme domain.
The most extensive HS shifts induced were with the C14:0–C16:0
fatty acids and NPG in intact CYP505A30 (80–95% HS heme iron
accumulation), and with the C14:0 and C15:0 fatty acids and NPG with
the heme domain (75–90% HS accumulation) (Table 1). Potentiometric studies of
the flavins in the intact CYP505A30 revealed that the reduction potentials
of the FAD and FMN cofactors are relatively positive and that their
transition from the OX (quinone) to two-electron reduced (HQ) states
occurs in the same potential range with a midpoint potential of −118
± 2 mV for the apparent overall four-electron reduction of the
two flavins. There is evidence of the formation of small amounts of
the neutral flavin SQ during the redox titration, as seen by small
changes (increase then decrease) in absorbance at ∼600 nm.
These properties are consistent with the optical features of a blue
SQ, and EPR studies confirmed the formation of flavin SQ species in
CYP505A30 (Figures 6, 9, and 10). A physiological
basis for the positive potentials of the CYP505A30 flavins became
clear through analysis of the redox potentials of the heme iron in
the CYP505A30 heme domain in its substrate-free and arachidonic acid-bound
forms. The midpoint reduction potential for the heme iron FeIII/FeII transition in the substrate-free state is −298
± 5 mV versus NHE, rising to −69 ± 3 mV versus NHE
in the arachidonic acid-bound form (Figure 7). The heme iron redox potential thus undergoes
a large increase on fatty acid binding, enabling its reduction by
the FMN cofactor in the reductase domain. A similar phenomenon (albeit
with flavin and heme potentials at more negative potentials) occurs
in P450 BM3, resulting in heme iron reduction occurring only in the
fatty acid substrate-bound form of the enzyme.39 In BM3, there is evidence for the formation of a blue SQ
in the FAD cofactor, and for the role of an anionic (red) SQ in the
process of electron transfer to the substrate-bound ferric heme iron.40,41,44 Our EPR studies on samples of
CYP505A30 reduced by NADPH and frozen for analysis at different time
intervals provide evidence for the presence of both neutral and anionic
SQs, suggesting that the mechanism of electron transfer within the
CYP505A30 reductase and from FMN-to-heme may be largely the same as
that observed for P450 BM3 (Figure 10). Other EPR studies confirm Cys thiolate coordination
of heme iron in both CYP505A30 and its heme domain (Figure 9).

Despite its origin
in the moderately thermophilic fungus M. thermophila, CYP505A30 and its heme domain did
not exhibit substantial thermostability. DSF to monitor unfolding
under different buffer conditions identified the best conditions giving
a Tm of 58 °C for CYP505A30 and of
48 °C for the heme domain, suggesting that the heme domain is
less thermostable than intact CYP505A30, as might be expected if the
intact enzyme forms more stable dimers. The Tm for the thermally induced transition of the P450 form (Cys
thiolate-coordinated) to the P420 form (Cys thiol-coordinated) occurred
at ∼43 °C, suggesting that loss of heme thiolate coordination
occurs at a lower temperature than the apparent Tm values for either intact CYP505A30 or its heme domain.
However, CYP505A30 is clearly functional in NADPH-dependent fatty
acid oxidation, and steady-state kinetic studies revealed kcat values of up to ∼450 min–1 with pentadecanoic acid (KD = 7.8 μM)
(Table 2 and Figure 11). There was no
evidence for substrate inhibition of the CYP505A30-catalyzed fatty
acid-dependent NADPH oxidation in assays with several fatty acids,
contrary to data from earlier studies on CYP505A1 where substrate
inhibition was reported for tetradecanoic, pentadecanoic, and hexadecanoic
acids.25 Steady-state analysis of the CYP505A30-mediated
reduction of cytochrome c and ferricyanide revealed kcat values of 29.7 ± 0.7 s–1 for cytochrome c reduction and 38.4 ± 1.8
s–1 for ferricyanide reduction (using NADPH as the
reductant in both cases). NADPH is the preferred cofactor, with a KM value of 3.1 ± 0.7 μM in cytochrome c reduction compared to 330 ± 56 μM for NADH.
These steady-state kcat values are substantially
higher than those for fatty acid oxidation, suggesting that the fatty
acid reaction rate is limited by FMN-to-heme electron transfer(s)
or, for example, by the rate of dissociation of the hydroxylated lipid
product. In P450 BM3, the rate of FMN-to-heme iron electron transfer
is ∼2-fold that of the overall turnover rate of the enzyme
in steady-state with dodecanoic acid, suggesting that this event is
important in steady-state rate limitation in BM3.18 Stopped-flow absorbance studies of flavin reduction in
CYP505A30 provided further evidence for the much tighter binding of
NADPH to the enzyme. There was negligible dependence of the apparent
flavin reduction rate using NADPH, whereas there was a hyperbolic
dependence observed with NADH as the electron donor and an apparent KD = 816 ± 113 μM.

Table 2 Steady-State Kinetic Data for CYP505A30a
substrate	kcat (s–1)	KM (μM)	kcat/KM (μM–1 s–1)	
dodecanoic acid (C12:0)	4.8 ± 0.2	21.2 ± 2.4	0.23

arachidonic acid (C20:4)	2.0 ± 0.1	9.2 ± 0.5	0.22	
a Steady-state kinetic assays were
done as described in the Experimental Methods section. The kcat and KM values were determined by fitting fatty acid-induced
NADPH oxidation rate constants (measured across a range of different
concentrations of the particular fatty acid) using the Michaelis–Menten
equation.

Following on from
the steady-state kinetic and equilibrium binding
studies of CYP505A30, substrate turnover studies were done using dodecanoic
acid (C12:0) and tetradecanoic acid (C14:0) substrates and with product
analysis done using GC–MS. The product outcomes were similar
for both of these substrates, yielding a mixture of ω-1, ω-2,
and ω-3 hydroxylated fatty acids in both cases. The formation
of a similar set of products was reported in previous studies of P450
BM3-dependent oxidation of these substrates.47 However, a clear difference in the regioselectivity of oxidation
of these substrates is evident between CYP505A30 and P450 BM3. Although
BM3 favors ω-1 hydroxylation, it also produces a substantial
amount of the ω-2 and ω-3 hydroxylated products (48% ω-1,
26% ω-2, and 26% ω-3 for dodecanoic acid). However, comparable
data for CYP505A30 show that the ω-3 hydroxylated dodecanoic
acid represents only a small amount of the final product mixture with
there being a much larger component of the ω-1 hydroxylated
dodecanoic acid (88% ω-1, 10% ω-2, and 2% ω-3 hydroxylated
dodecanoic acid) (Figure 13). A similar phenomenon was observed using tetradecanoic acid
as the CYP505A30 substrate (63% ω-1, 28% ω-2, and 9% ω-3
hydroxylated tetradecanoic acid). Kitazume et al. also reported dodecanoic
acid oxidation by CYP505A1.26 The products
formed were ∼55% ω-1, ∼37% ω-2, and ∼8%
ω-3 hydroxylated dodecanoic acid. Although the order of the
magnitude for the three hydroxylated products formed from dodecanoic
acid is the same for CYP505A1/CY505A30, there is a large difference
in the ratio for the ω-1/ω-2 hydroxylated products (1.5
for CYP505A1 and 8.8 for CYP505A30), highlighting greater specificity
for ω-1 hydroxylation in CYP505A30.

In conclusion, a novel
member of the CYP505 P450–CPR fusion
enzyme family has been expressed and purified using an E. coli expression system. M. thermophila CYP505A30 has hydroxylase activity toward fatty acids, hydroxylating
both dodecanoic acid and tetradecanoic acid predominantly at the ω-1
position. Further studies are required to characterize the full repertoire
of lipid substrates for this P450, but its moderate thermostability
may prove advantageous in biotechnological applications for production
of oxygenated molecules. Ongoing work is being focused on identifying
the hydroxylated products generated by CYP505A30 from a variety of
other straight chain and branched chain lipids.

Experimental Methods
CYP505A30
Retrieval and Bioinformatics Analysis
The CYP505A30 gene was identified as a potential orthologue
of P450 BM3 (CYP102A1 from B. megaterium) using the conserved domain architecture retrieval tool (CDART)
program.49 CDART was used to search for
protein sequences of BM3 homologues from thermophilic organisms. The
bioinformatics tool identifies functional domains from the amino acid
sequence input through reverse position specific-BLAST before querying
the National Center for Biotechnology Information database for protein
sequences with similar domain architectures. The 1080 amino acid sequence
of a hypothetical protein MYCTH_101224A from the fungus M. thermophila (UniProt: G2QDZ3 [G2QDZ3_MYCTT]) was
selected from the resulting list based on the thermophilic nature
of the host organism. This novel P450–CPR fusion gene was assigned
as CYP505A30 in the cytochrome P450 gene superfamily
on the basis of its relatedness to other eukaryotic P450–CPR
fusion enzymes. Amino acid alignment of the CYP505A30 sequence with
CYP102A1 and other CYP505 family member sequences was done using the
Clustal Omega program through the EBI web site (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/).

Cloning of the CYP505A30 Gene and Construction of Expression
Plasmids for the Intact CYP505A30 and Its Heme Domain
The CYP505A30 gene sequence from the thermophilic fungus M. thermophila was synthesized by GenScript (Cherwell,
U.K.) in an E. coli codon optimized
form and inserted into the pUC57 vector. The CYP505A30 gene was subcloned into the pET15b expression vector by digestion
of both plasmids with NdeI and BamHI (NEB, Hertfordshire, U.K.), and by ligation of the CYP505A30 gene-containing fragment into pET15b using T4 DNA ligase (NEB).
The correct cloning and sequence of the gene was verified by DNA sequencing
(Source BioScience, Nottingham, U.K.).

A heme (P450) domain
construct was generated from the intact WT CYP505A30 gene construct in pET15b. A pairwise alignment of CYP505A30 and
P450 BM3 (CYP102A1) facilitated the selection of D464 as an appropriate
terminal residue of the CYP505A30 heme domain. An ochre stop codon
(TAA) was introduced in place of the codon for amino acid Gly465 at
the end of the heme domain (D464X mutant) using a QuikChange Lightning
site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene-Agilent, U.K.). The oligonucleotide
primer 5′-GTGCTATTCTGCGCGACTAACTGACCGCGACGGAACT-3′
and its reverse complement were synthesized by Eurofins MWG Operon
(Ebersberg, Germany) and used for polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
mutagenesis. The D464X CYP505A30 heme domain gene construct in pET15b
was fully sequenced to ensure the presence of the stop codon at the
correct location, and the absence of undesired mutations (Source BioScience,
Nottingham, U.K.).

Expression and Purification of Intact CYP505A30
and Its Heme
Domain
The genes for both the wild-type, intact CYP505A30
(amino acids 1–1080), and its heme domain (amino acids 1–464)
were expressed in BL21-Gold (DE3) E. coli cells (Stratagene-Agilent, U.K.) using 500 mL of Luria–Bertani
medium in 2 L shake flasks inoculated with 5 mL of an overnight culture
of the respective transformant cells. The E. coli transformant cultures were incubated at 37 °C and with agitation
at 200 rpm in an orbital incubator until an OD600 of 0.6
was reached. Thereafter, P450 overexpression was induced with 0.8
mM isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside, and 0.4 mM
ΔALA was added to the culture to promote heme incorporation
into the intact CYP505A30 and its heme domain. The temperature was
lowered to 25 °C, and cells were grown for a further 16–20
h. The bacterial cells were then recovered by centrifugation at 4
°C (6000g, 8 min) and resuspended in 25 mL of
buffer A (50 mM potassium phosphate [KPi], pH 7.0) per litre of culture.
DNase I (100 μg/mL, bovine pancreas; Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, U.K.)
and lysozyme (100 μg/mL, hen egg white; Sigma-Aldrich) were
added to degrade chromosomal DNA and to aid bacterial cell lysis.
Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-free cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail
tablets (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) were used in all
protein purification buffers. Cells were lysed by sonication on ice
using a Bandelin Sonopuls sonicator (40% power, 45 pulses for 8 s
with 40 s between pulses). The supernatant containing soluble intact
CYP505A30 enzyme or its heme domain was separated from cell debris
by centrifugation (20 000g, 40 min, 4 °C).

The intact CYP505A30 enzyme was partially purified from the clarified
cell extract supernatant using an initial ammonium sulfate (30% w/v)
mixing step on ice. Precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation
(20 000g, 30 min, 4 °C). The supernatant
was then mixed with 2′,5′-adenosine 5′-diphosphate
Sepharose resin in buffer A containing 10 mM 5′-AMP for 3 h
at 4 °C on a rolling table. Thereafter, the resin was packed
into a column (2 × 10 cm2) and washed with a further
3 column volumes of buffer A plus 10 mM 5′-AMP to remove unbound
contaminant proteins, followed by elution of CYP505A30 from the resin
with 200 mM 5′-AMP in buffer A. The eluted protein fractions
were pooled, dialyzed into 50 mM KPi (pH 8.0) containing 200 mM KCl
(buffer B), and concentrated by ultrafiltration using a Vivaspin ultrafiltration
device (100 kDa molecular weight cut-off [MWCO]) (Sartorius, Epsom,
U.K.). The concentrated sample was loaded onto a Q-Sepharose ion exchange
chromatography column. CYP505A30 elution was achieved by applying
a linear gradient of 0–500 mM KCl in 50 mM Tris (pH 7.0) (buffer
C). The fractions containing the purest CYP505A30 samples were pooled
and concentrated by ultrafiltration as described above. A final purification
step was done by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) in buffer A using
a Sephacryl S-200 column (26 × 60 cm2) on an ÄKTA
purification system (GE Healthcare, Amersham, U.K.). Intact CYP505A30
fractions collected were checked for purity by SDS-PAGE, concentrated
by ultrafiltration (as described above) to a final concentration of
∼800 mM, and frozen in buffer A containing 10% glycerol at
−80 °C. The flavoenzyme concentration was determined spectrophotometrically
using an absorption coefficient of Δε457 =
23 000 M–1 cm–1 for the
OX minus sodium dithionite-reduced difference spectrum, as described
previously.50 The P450 heme concentration
of CYP505A30 was determined as described previously, using a coefficient
of 91 000 M–1 cm–1 for
the absorption difference between 450 and 490 nm in the reduced/CO
minus reduced P450 spectrum.51 The concentration
of the CYP505A30 flavocytochrome in its OX form was estimated spectrophotometrically
using a coefficient of ε415 = 105 000 M–1 cm–1, whereas that for the OX heme
domain was estimated using ε418 = 95 000 M–1 cm–1.39

The CYP505A30 heme domain was purified from its clarified
cell
extract by mixing with Ni–iminodiacetic acid nickel chromatographic
resin (Generon, Maidenhead, U.K.) in 10 mM imidazole for 3 h on a
rolling table at 4 °C, before elution of the heme domain from
the resin using 200 mM imidazole in buffer A. The eluted protein was
then dialyzed into buffer A at 4 °C and concentrated by ultrafiltration
(as described above, but using a 30 kDa MWCO Vivaspin) before a further
purification step by SEC on an ÄKTA purifier using a Sephacryl
S-200 column (as described above) in buffer A. Heme domain protein
fractions were checked for purity by SDS-PAGE, concentrated by ultrafiltration,
and frozen in buffer A at −80 °C.

Identification and Quantification
of Flavin Cofactors Using
HPLC
A 100 mL sample of intact CYP505A30 (40 mM) was incubated
in a sealed Eppendorf tube in buffer A at 90 °C for 10 min to
release the flavin cofactors from its reductase domain. Centrifugation
at 20 000g for 5 min separated the soluble
flavins from the precipitated, denatured enzyme. A 60 mL sample of
the flavin (FAD and FMN)-containing supernatant was then loaded onto
a reverse phase C18 HPLC column (Ascentis, Sigma-Aldrich, U.K.) in
85% 5 mM ammonium acetate (pH 6.5) and 15% methanol. Chromatographic
resolution of FAD and FMN was achieved by increasing the methanol
concentration linearly from 15 to 100% over 30 min. Absorbance was
monitored at 264 nm. FAD and FMN standards of known concentration
were resolved using the same method, and integration of the peak areas
of these flavin samples allowed a standard curve to be generated.
In turn, this allowed for the quantities of the FAD and FMN samples
released from denatured CYP505A30 to be determined by interpolation,
as described previously.50

Fatty Acid
and Inhibitor Binding Titrations with CYP505A30
All P450
spectral binding measurements were carried out on a Cary
60 UV–visible spectrophotometer (Agilent). Spectral binding
titrations of CYP505A30 and its heme domain with saturated linear
chain fatty acids (C10–C18), arachidonic acid, and NPG (Sigma,
Poole, U.K. and Cambridge Bioscience, Cambridge, U.K.) were performed
at 25 °C in buffer A using 1 mL volume samples containing ∼4–6
μM enzyme in a 1 cm pathlength cuvette. Substrate stock solutions
were made at 1–20 mM in 80% ethanol in H2O. Prior
to the binding titrations, all enzyme samples in buffer A were passed
through a Lipidex column of dimensions 5 × 1 cm2 (PerkinElmer,
Cambridge, U.K.) to remove any residual lipid retained during protein
purification. The CYP505A30 sample recovered from the column was in
an extensively LS ferric state, as established by its UV–visible
spectrum. Titrations were performed by stepwise additions of aliquots
(0.1–1 μL) of the fatty acids to the CYP505A30/heme domain
sample (substrate additions did not exceed 1% of the total sample
volume). UV–visible spectra (750–250 nm) were recorded
for the ligand-free enzyme and following each addition of substrate.
Substrate additions were continued until no further shifts in the
heme spectrum occurred. Difference spectra were generated at each
stage in the titration by subtraction of the spectrum for the ligand-free
enzyme from each subsequent ligand-bound form of CYP505A30/heme domain
spectrum produced. The wavelengths of the absorbance minimum and maximum
were identified from the difference spectra, and a maximal induced
absorbance change (ΔAmax) at each
point in the titration was determined by subtracting the absorbance
at the wavelength minimum from that at the absorbance maximum, using
the same wavelength pair throughout each titration. ΔAmax values were then plotted against ligand
concentration, and data were fitted using either a hyperbolic (Michaelis–Menten)
function or the Morrison function for tight-binding ligands, to determine
dissociation constants (KD values), as
described previously.38,52 Morrison’s equation was
used in preference when the KD value was
≤5× the P450 concentration. All data fitting was done
using Origin software (OriginLab, Northampton, MA).

Steady-State
Enzyme Assays
The steady-state activities
of CYP505A30 were determined using cytochrome c and
FeCN as electron acceptors, and NAD(P)H as electron donors. Experiments
were done using a Cary 300 (Varian) dual-beam spectrophotometer. To
account for low rates of nonenzyme-mediated (i.e., NAD(P)H-dependent)
reduction of electron acceptors, assays were performed in the dual-beam
spectrophotometer alongside a reference cuvette containing the same
components but no enzyme, and by replacing the same volume of buffer
in place of the enzyme. The reaction was initiated by the simultaneous
addition of NAD(P)H to both cuvettes. Cytochrome c (horse heart; Sigma-Aldrich) reduction rate constants were measured
at 550 nm (Δε550(red-ox) = 22 640
M–1 cm–1), and ferricyanide reduction
rate constants were measured at 420 nm (Δε420(red-ox) = 1020 M–1cm–1). Reactions were
performed in 1 mL of buffer A at 25 °C using 20–50 nM
CYP505A30. The kcat values for cytochrome c and ferricyanide were determined at a fixed and near-saturating
concentration of NAD(P)H (200 μM for NADPH and 800 μM
for NADH). The KM values for NADH and
NADPH were measured at near-saturating concentrations of cytochrome c and FeCN (400 μM for cytochrome c and 2 mM for FeCN). Steady-state kinetic assays were also done at
25 °C in buffer A using a series of saturated fatty acids (C12:0,
C13:0, C14:0, and C15:0) and the polyunsaturated arachidonic acid
(a good substrate for P450 BM3). Reactions were initiated by the addition
of 200 μM NADPH to 1 mL of buffer A containing 20–50
nM CYP505A30 and various concentrations of lipid substrates. Rate
constants at different substrate concentrations were determined using
Δε340 = 6.210 M–1 cm–1 for NADPH oxidation. Origin software was used in
data fitting to derive KM and kcat values from steady-state assays, using the
Michaelis–Menten equation to fit the data (OriginLab, Northampton,
MA).

Stopped-Flow Kinetic Studies on CYP505A30
Single-turnover
stopped-flow kinetic studies were done to determine the kinetics of
CYP505A30 flavin reduction using NAD(P)H, similarly to previous experiments
done on P450 BM3.41 Reactions were performed
using an Applied Photophysics SX.18 MVR stopped-flow spectrophotometer
(Leatherhead, U.K.) contained within an anaerobic glovebox under a
nitrogen environment, and with oxygen levels maintained below 2 ppm
(Belle Technology, Weymouth, U.K.). Stopped-flow spectral data accumulation
was done at single wavelengths and by using a photodiode array detector
on the same instrument for full spectral accumulation. Kinetics of
CYP505A30 flavin reduction by NADH and NADPH were monitored at 475
nm and at 10 °C in buffer A. The final CYP505A30 concentration
in the stopped-flow mixture was 10 μM and final NADPH and NADH
concentrations were in the range from 60 to 1200 μM. Subsequent
studies of the NADPH-dependent flavin reduction of CYP505A30 were
done at 5 °C intervals between 10 and 35 °C in buffer A,
and with final enzyme and NADPH concentrations of 10 μM and
1 mM, respectively.

Thermostability Studies on CYP505A30
Thermal fluorescence
studies were done using SYPRO Orange (SO) (Life Technologies, Carlsbad)
to report on CYP505A30 thermal stability. SO used for thermal unfolding
was supplied as a 5000× stock solution in anhydrous DMSO, and
was diluted to a 25× working concentration for all samples. Samples
of CYP505A30 (1 mg/mL) were prepared in a range of 50 mM buffer solutions
(containing various additives) from the JBS solubility screen kit
(Jena Bioscience GmbH, Jena, Germany). Samples were analyzed in a
96 well thin-wall PCR plate (Bio-Rad) sealed with optical-quality
sealing tape (Bio-Rad). The plates were heated in an iCycler iQ RT
PCR detection system (Bio-Rad) from 20 to 90 °C in increments
of 0.2 °C, and fluorescence emission intensities were monitored
simultaneously with a charge-coupled device camera. The wavelengths
used for excitation and emission of SO were 492 and 610 nm, respectively.
Thermal unfolding was measured as a function of fluorescence emission
at 610 nm, enabling the production of a fluorescence melt curve of
relative fluorescence units against temperature. The melting temperature
(Tm) in each case was determined from
the peak of the first derivative plot of the fluorescence melt curve.
Further studies were done to explore the thermostability of the CYP505A30
FeII–CO complex and its transition between the thiolate-coordinated
P450 state and the thiol-coordinated P420 state. A solution of ∼2.5
μM CYP5050A30 in buffer A containing 200 mM KCl was made under
anaerobic conditions and a P450 complex at ∼450 nm was prepared
through addition of a few grains of sodium dithionite and slow bubbling
of the sample with CO. Thereafter, the temperature was increased in
2.5 °C increments between 25 and 60 °C with 30 s delays
at each new temperature prior to spectral data collection. The extent
of the P450-to-P420 transition was established by plotting the observed
absorbance change (ΔA420 –
ΔA450 to obtain a midpoint (Tm) for the transition).

MALLS Analysis
MALLS data were collected using a DAWN
EOS MALLS detector (Wyatt Technology, Santa Barbara) using 5 mg protein
samples in buffer A containing 200 mM KCl, immediately following an
integrated Superdex 200 gel filtration step (GE Healthcare). MALLS
data were collected at a 1 s interval rate using a K5 cell type and
a laser wavelength of 658 nm.

EPR Studies on CYP505A30
and Its Heme Domain
Continuous
wave EPR spectra were recorded at the X-band (∼9.4 GHz) using
a Bruker ELEXSYS E500/E580 EPR spectrophotometer (Bruker GmbH, Rheinstetten,
Germany). Temperature control was effected using an Oxford Instruments
ESR900 helium flow cryostat coupled to an ITC503 controller from the
same manufacturer. EPR spectra for both CYP505A30 and its heme domain
were recorded at 10 K with a microwave power of 2.08 mW. Samples contained
enzyme at a concentration of 225 μM in buffer A containing 500
mM KCl. Fatty acid substrates were added to a concentration of 1 mM.
EPR spectra for flavin SQ analysis were collected at 77 K using intact
CYP505A30. To enable formation of the flavin SQ species, CYP505A30
samples were incubated with NADPH (2 mM) and incubated for 30 s, 5
min, and 10 min in each case at ambient temperature, prior to freezing
of the samples in liquid nitrogen.

CYP505A30 Redox Potentiometry
Redox titrations were
performed for both CYP505A30 and its heme domain in an anaerobic glovebox
(Belle Technology) under a nitrogen atmosphere, with O2 levels maintained below 2 ppm. All solutions were degassed by sparging
with N2 gas. The proteins were applied to an Econo-Pac
10DG desalting column (Bio-Rad, Hemel Hempstead, U.K.) in the anaerobic
box, which was pre-equilibrated with degassed buffer A containing
200 mM KCl (redox buffer) enabling transfer of the enzymes into the
anaerobic redox titration buffer. For the substrate-bound heme domain
titration, the redox buffer also contained 10% glycerol (v/v) and
1 mM arachidonic acid. The proteins (∼10–20 μM
in 5 mL of redox buffer) were titrated electrochemically according
to the method of Dutton, using sodium dithionite as a reductant.53 Dithionite was delivered in approximately 0.1–0.5
μL aliquots from concentrated stock solutions (typically ∼50
mM). Mediators were added to facilitate electrical communication between
the redox cofactors in the enzyme and the electrode, prior to titration.
2 μM phenazine methosulfate, 5 μM 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone,
0.5 μM methyl viologen, and 1 μM benzyl viologen were
included to mediate in the range between +100 and −480 mV.
The electrode was allowed to stabilize between each dithionite addition
and spectra (250–750 nm) were recorded using a fiber optic
probe linked to the Cary UV-50 Bio UV–visible scanning spectrophotometer
and immersed in the redox protein solution. Data manipulation and
analysis were performed using Origin software. For titration of intact
CYP505A30, absorbance values at 475 nm were plotted against potential
to follow flavin reduction. For the redox titration of the substrate-free
heme domain, difference spectra were generated by subtraction of the
spectrum for the OX heme domain from each subsequent heme domain spectrum
collected during the heme iron reduction process. The overall absorbance
change occurring during heme domain reduction was calculated by subtracting
the absorbance minimum (Atrough) from
the maximum (Apeak) to give ΔAmax, using the same wavelength pair throughout.
The ΔAmax was then plotted against
the applied potential and data were fitted using the Nernst equation.
For the arachidonic acid-bound heme domain redox titration, absorbance
data at 390 nm (at the peak for the substrate-bound form) were plotted
versus applied potential, and data were again fitted using the Nernst
equation, as described previously.3,39 A factor of
+207 mV was used to correct for the difference in electrode potential
reading between the Ag/AgCl electrode used in the titration and the
NHE.

Fatty Acid Oxidation by CYP505A30, and Product Derivatization
and Analysis Using GC–MS
Turnover reactions for fatty
acid hydroxylation by WT CYP505A30 were carried out at 37 °C
with shaking for 30 min. Reaction mixtures contained purified CYP505A30
(100 μM), fatty acid substrate (1 mM lauric acid or myristic
acid), NADPH (500 μM), and an NADPH regeneration system (glucose
6-phosphate [7.76 mM], NADP+ [0.6 mM], and glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase [0.75 units/mL]) in buffer A and in a final volume of
2 mL. Following completion of the reaction, the protein was precipitated
by heating at 100 °C for 10 min and pelleted by centrifugation
(4000g, 25 min, 10 °C). Hydroxylated fatty acid
products were isolated from the supernatant by filtration through
a StrataX SPE column (Phenomenex, Macclesfield, U.K.) into mass spectrometry
vials. Samples were dried down before derivatization in a rotary evaporator.
Derivatization was carried out by adding 0.5 mL of N,O-bis(trimethyl)trifluoroacetamide/0.1% trichloromethylsilane
(Sigma, Poole, U.K.) to the dried sample and by incubating at 60 °C
for 60 min. Product analysis was done using a Thermo Fisher DSQ II
GC/MS instrument with a 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm ZB5MS
GC column (Phenomenex). Injection was cold on-column. The oven program
was set so that an initial temperature of 50 °C was ramped at
23 °C/min to 310 °C post-injection. Electronic ionization
was used, and ions in the range of 40–640 m/z were scanned at two scans per second.

Materials
Unless otherwise stated, all reagents were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Poole, U.K.) and were of the highest
grade available.
