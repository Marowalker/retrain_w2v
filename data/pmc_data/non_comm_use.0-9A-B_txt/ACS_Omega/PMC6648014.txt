With this study, an innovative and
convenient enrichment and detection
strategy for eight clinically relevant pneumonia pathogens, namely, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia
coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae is introduced.
Bacteria were isolated from sputum samples with amine-modified particles
exploiting pH-dependent electrostatic interactions between bacteria
and the functionalized particle surface. Following this, an asymmetric
polymerase chain reaction as well as subsequent stringent array-based
hybridization with specific complementary capture probes were performed.
Finally, results were visualized by an enzyme-induced silver nanoparticle
deposition, providing stable endpoint signals and consequently an
easy detection possibility. The assay was optimized using spiked samples
of artificial sputum with different strains of the abovementioned
bacterial species. Furthermore, actual patient sputum samples with S. pneumoniae were successfully analyzed. The presented
approach offers great potential for the urgent need of a fast, specific,
and reliable isolation and identification platform for important pneumonia
pathogens, covering the complete process chain from sample preparation
up to array-based detection within only 4 h.

==== Body
Introduction
According
to the World Health Organization (WHO), pneumonia is
the most common infectious disease worldwide. It is associated with
very high morbidity and mortality, especially among patients with
a compromised immune system or small children.1 In 2015, pneumonia killed 92 0136 children under the age
of five, accounting for 16% of all deaths of children under five years.2 Pneumonia can be caused by bacteria, viruses,
or fungi.3 Most often, bacterial pneumonia
is induced by an infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae.4 Currently, the gold standard for diagnosing
this disease is the microbiological cultivation of the pathogens along
with an X-ray examination of the lung and a blood cell count.5,6 Unfortunately, this approach is very time consuming and not all
pathogens can be successfully cultivated. Accordingly, for therapy,
a broad-spectrum antibiotic is frequently administered before the
result of the cultivation is even known. This unspecific and random
use of antibiotics is highly problematic regarding the increase in
drug-resistant bacteria. A delayed initiation of the appropriate therapy,
however, is also not ideal as an effective treatment of pneumonia
requires early intervention.7 At present,
only one-third of children with bacterial pneumonia receive the right
antibiotics.8 This illustrates that there
is an urgent unmet medical need for fast and highly specific assays
for diagnosing pneumonia.

In principal, this need already has
been recognized, and efforts
were made to develop alternatives to a culture-based diagnosis. Generally,
assays based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have a great potential
for detecting pathogens causing pneumonia because of the speed and
high specificity of this method. Kim et al. developed a multiplex
PCR assay capable of differentiating between virulent S. pneumoniae and ubiquitous normal flora, Streptococcus mitis, and Streptococcus
oralis in respiratory samples.9 Li et al. combined real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) with an immunoassay
for improving the detection of Mycoplasma pneumonia infections in children with pneumonia.10 Furthermore, a real-time PCR assay targeting eight different bacteria
and six viruses relevant for respiratory tract diseases was introduced
by Edin et al.11 Recently, Gadsby et al.
established two real-time multiplex PCR assays enabling the quantification
of eight respiratory pathogens.12 While
qPCR provides both high specificity and sensitivity even with the
possibility for quantitation, major obstacles preventing its use in
routine clinical diagnostics are the high costs as well as the rather
complicated associated experimental procedures. Regarding point-of-care
applications, isothermal amplification has been proven to be less
demanding in terms of equipment and financial burden. For example,
Gotoh et al. successfully applied loop-mediated isothermal amplification
(LAMP) for detecting Mycoplasma pneumoniae.13 Huang et al. integrated a LAMP-based
detection scheme into a microfluidic system, allowing a parallel and
automated nucleic acid analysis of 24 samples.14 Moreover, Renner et al. designed a user-friendly cartridge,
in which isothermal amplification enables detecting various clinically
relevant bacterial species.15 To the best
of our knowledge, the BIOFIRE FILMARRAY (Pneumonia Panel) currently
offers the widest range of respiratory pathogen identification based
on multiplex PCR, including a fully automated sample preparation.
Results will be available within only 1 h. Next to PCR-based approaches,
matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy
(MALDI-TOF MS) can be used to identify bacterial species from blood
cultures within 1 h. Even though MALDI-TOF MS is an attractive tool
for the identification of bacteria, within the context of pneumonia
diagnosis, it is a distinct disadvantage, that a precultivation step
is necessary in order to generate sufficient amounts of biomass for
the analysis.16 Alternatively, immunoassays
are a further option for the specific detection of pneumonia pathogens.
Li et al. developed an immuno-chromatographic assay, which allows
a rapid and sensitive detection of M. pneumoniae from sputum samples or throat swabs.17 In practice, urinary antigen tests, such as ImmuView UAT and BinaxNOW,
are frequently applied for detecting S. pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila in urine
samples.18 Furthermore, Wang et al. recently
reported an electrochemical immunosensor to detect the pneumococcal
surface protein A, enabling ultrasensitive detection of S. pneumoniae.19

While it is encouraging that various promising attempts for a fast
diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia already have been made, some challenges
still remain. For instance, many approaches only encompass the amplification
and detection steps, omitting the sample preprocessing which is necessary
for the application of real samples. Others only address single species.
The aim of the present study is to cover the entire process chain,
starting with an efficient isolation and enrichment of the bacteria
from patients’ sputum samples up to the specific detection
of eight pneumonia-relevant pathogens in parallel (Figure 1). With regard to the potential
application in point-of-care testing, we made special efforts to incorporate
cost-efficient materials and to keep the assay as simple and convenient
as possible. For sample preparation, we employed expanded glass beads
(EGB), which are an intermediate product occurring during the recycling
process of glass. Our assay begins with the liquefaction of the sputum
samples, followed by the isolation of the bacteria from the complex
sample matrix using EGB. These feature an amine modification, that
allows a pH-dependent adhesion and desorption of cells. After a lysis
step, the target DNA is exponentially amplified and labeled using
specific primers. Finally, the PCR products are further analyzed using
array-based hybridization and enzyme-induced silver deposition. The
generated silver nanoparticles in case of a positive reaction served
as robust endpoint signals allowing an immediate visual readout by
the naked eye.

Results and Discussion
The main
objective of this study was the development of a PCR-based
assay enabling the fast and reliable detection of bacterial pneumonia
from sputum samples. We addressed the whole process chain and considered
sample preparation as well as a user-friendly detection scheme. Prior
to the amplification of the target DNA, we utilized a bead-based approach
for the isolation of the bacterial cells from the sputum matrix. As
it is our goal to address multiple species, we chose amine-modified
particles for the sample preparation. Based on electrostatic interactions
between the bacterial cell wall and the bead surface, this type of
surface modification allows directed binding or detachment of the
bacteria depending on the pH value of the surrounding buffer. The
particle surface will exhibit a positive charge because of protonated
amine groups in the acidic to neutral pH range causing an attractive
force for the bacteria, which generally have a negative charge on
their surface. By raising the pH to the alkaline region, the amine
groups will be deprotonated. Accordingly, the bacterial cells are
no longer drawn to the particle surface and can be detached. This
principle is highly interesting for assays, which aim at isolating
several pathogens, because various bacterial species can be captured
with only one type of surface modification.20,21 The expensive and often troublesome surface modification of particles
with antibodies can be avoided.

Array-Based Detection of Eight Bacterial
Species Relevant for
Respiratory Diseases
We tested two types of amine-functionalized
particles, namely, EGB and PEI-modified PE particles, for the isolation
of pneumonia-relevant bacteria from sputum samples. In order to optimize
the protocol for the particle-based isolation of the pneumonia pathogens
from sputum samples, we used an artificial sputum matrix spiked with
defined cell numbers of eight different species (Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and S. pneumoniae) to a final concentration
between 105 and 106 cfu/mL. Each sample was
divided into two equal volumes and the isolation was performed with
both types of particles. After that, a heat lysis of the cells was
performed, followed by the amplification of the target DNA. In order
to verify each single step of the process chain, successful amplification
of all pathogens was as well examined on agarose gels (exemplarily
shown in Figure S1). Using the biotinylated
primers (see Figure 1B) resulted in biotin-labeled PCR products. These were finally hybridized
on polymer chips modified with specific capture probes for the pathogens
of interest. By incubating the chips with a streptavidin enzyme conjugate,
the successful hybridization can be visualized exploiting the enzyme-catalyzed
reduction of silver ions: the streptavidin enzyme conjugate will bind
to biotinylated-hybridized PCR products and induce the reduction of
the silver ions to elementary silver resulting in the formation of
silver nanoparticles (see Figure 1C). The silver nanoparticles are visible to the naked
eye as black or gray spots on the chip surface and can be further
investigated using gray value analysis (see Figure 1D). The results of the corresponding analysis
for the samples processed either with EGB or polymer particles are
summarized in Figure 2. For clarity, we only displayed the gray values of the positions
of the correct capture probes for each species. Both sample preparation
methods enabled the PCR-based detection of all eight investigated
species. For each sample, the results of the array-based hybridization
were specific, meaning no false positive signals were obtained at
the positions of the noncomplementary probes. The respective diagrams
can be found in the Supporting Information (Figure S2 for EGB and Figure S3 for polymer particles). Generally,
we found that the signal intensities were slightly higher for the
EGB, with the exception of the samples with H. influenzae and S. aureus. With these results,
we were able to demonstrate that our introduced assay enables detecting
each of the eight investigated respiratory species from sputum samples.
The time required for completing the whole process chain only accounts
for 4 h. As the handling of the glass beads with the highly viscous
sputum matrix turned out to be even more convenient than the use of
the polymer beads, we decided to employ the glass beads for all future
experiments.

measured
at the positions of the species-specific capture probes for eight
pneumonia-relevant pathogens for EGB and PEI-modified particles (PEI).

Detection of Patient Isolates
In order to investigate
the applicability of the abovementioned assay, the optimized protocol
was further tested for several strains of S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, and H.
influenzae isolated from patients of the University
Hospital Jena. For this purpose, artificial sputum was spiked with
ten different strains to a final concentration of approximately 105 cfu/mL. Subsequently, the complete protocol starting from
the isolation of the pathogens with EGB was conducted. The results
of the gray value analysis from the polymer chips after performing
the hybridization assay are depicted in Figure 3. Because no unspecific signals at the noncomplementary
probe positions were detected, we only included the values of the
correct species-specific probes for better comprehensibility. The
detailed evaluation of each chip can be found in the Supporting Information (see Figure S4). Overall, the results
are in good agreement with the previously investigated strains. We
were able to unambiguously detect all of the ten patient strains.
For the two isolates of H. influenzae, the intensities of the gray values were even more pronounced than
those of the ATCC 9007 strain. The same trend was observed for the
three S. pneumoniae isolates, the gray
values of which all exceeded 80%, while the type strain DSM 20566
typically yielded intensities of approximately 55%. For the five isolates
of S. aureus, we obtained signal intensities
between 40 and 80%, while the type strain DSM 20231 displayed a mean
intensity of 55% in comparable experiments. These results indicate
that the established protocol is capable of covering several different
pneumonia-relevant bacterial species with only one set of parameters
for the isolation protocol. Even though the signal intensities vary,
depending from the species and also the strain, a distinct identification
is enabled in each case. One factor impacting the gray values of the
chip-based hybridization protocol is the isolation yield in the sample
preparation. Depending on the composition of the bacterial cell surface
and the presence of functional groups contributing to the surface
charge of the cells, the attractive interaction between the particles
and the cells will be influenced. The constitution of the cell surface
of course is affected by the species (Gram-positive, Gram-negative
bacteria), the strain, and even the growth conditions. Accordingly,
it would be possible to optimize the isolation protocol for each species
or strain. However, we refrained from this proceeding, as it was our
goal to access multiple species with one protocol. Based on the presented
results, it can be concluded that the introduced approach shows great
promise to be robust enough for coping with the cell surface variations
that occur within one species from strain to strain.

values measured at the positions of the
species-specific capture probes for ten different pneumonia-relevant
strains isolated from patients.

Determination of the Limit of Detection
A critical
parameter for the application of an assay in a clinical setting is
the sensitivity. Because S. pneumoniae is the most common causative agent of pneumonia, we performed the
corresponding experiments with the type strain of S.
pneumoniae. Briefly, samples with artificial sputum
in the concentration range between 102 and 106 cfu/mL were prepared and the full process chain was completed. Down
to a concentration of 103 cfu/mL, we were able to detect
the type strain of S. pneumoniae as
can be referred from Figure 4. For the sample of 102 cfu/mL, we did not obtain
a significant gray value in the hybridization assay. In contrast,
the analytical gel showed distinct bands only for 106 and
105 cfu/mL (see Figure S5).
Once again, the results of the array-based hybridization were specific
and no signals were detected at the noncomplementary probe positions
(data not shown). The sensitivity of our assay is sufficient for investigating
sputum samples as typical bacterial loads range from 103 to 107 cfu/mL.22 Comparable
results were reported by Gillespie et al. They also targeted the autolysine
gene lytA of S. pneumoniae and were able to detect the pathogen down to a concentration of
104 cfu/mL in a simulated sputum matrix using conventional
PCR.23 The sensitivity can be further improved
by employing qPCR. Werno et al. achieved reproducible and quantifiable
results to a level of 102 cfu/mL also addressing the lytA gene.22 Ikegame et al. investigated
clinical sputum specimens for evaluating the performance of an antigen
kit for the C-polysaccharide of the bacterial cell wall of S. pneumoniae. They found that 105 cfu/mL
was required for a positive test result.24 Overall, the sensitivity of our assay is comparable or superior
to other PCR-based detection schemes for S. pneumoniae from complex samples.

species-specific capture
probes for S. pneumoniae after performing
the complete assay with samples of different concentrations.

Investigation of Real Sputum
Samples
Finally, we challenged
our assay by processing actual patient samples. From the University
Hospital in Jena, we received three leftover samples, which had been
previously characterized via routine microbiological methods. In each
of the samples, only the standard microflora was detected. We spiked
each sample with the type strain of S. pneumoniae to a concentration of 106 cfu/mL and performed the whole
process chain from isolation of the bacterial cells to the array-based
hybridization. In general, we were able to detect S.
pneumoniae in all samples as can be seen in Figure 5. For the samples
R002 and R003, we obtained signal intensities over 80%. For the sample
R001, however, only a comparably low intensity of 20% was achieved.
The lower yield can probably be ascribed to difficulties during sample
preprocessing. Sample R001 displayed a very high viscosity compared
to samples R002 and R003, accordingly the mixing of the beads and
sample was apparently less efficient than in the other samples. Nevertheless,
the outcome of the experiment is encouraging and proves the general
applicability of our assay for real samples.

three sputum samples spiked with S. pneumoniae DSM 20566 and corresponding chips after

Conclusions
We developed a fast and convenient PCR-based
assay enabling the
detection of eight different pneumonia-relevant pathogens within 4
h. Our approach covers the complete chain of analysis from sample
preparation to array-based detection. We included robust and cost-efficient
materials, wherever possible, that is, EGB, which are a byproduct
from glass recycling. Our sample preparation strategy relies on amine-functionalized
particles, which are capable of isolating a broad range of different
Gram-negative and Gram-positive species, as demonstrated in this study.
The species-specific identification was achieved with a hybridization
assay on low-cost polymer chips. An additional advantage of these
chips is the simple functionalization with capture probes, without
the need of any additional surface modification. The detection method
based on enzyme-catalyzed silver deposition is not only robust, but
also entails great potential for an automated readout and analysis,
that is via smartphone. We successfully detected eight species in
an artificial sputum matrix and could also show that the previously
optimized parameters work well for different patient strains. Regarding
sensitivity, we found a detection limit of 103 cfu/mL for
the type strain of S. pneumoniae, which
is sufficient for the vast majority of sputum samples. Furthermore,
we were able to successfully analyze real sputum samples spiked with S. pneumoniae. Overall, our results make an important
contribution toward the development of culture-independent, sensitive,
and specific point-of-care assays for the reliable detection of pneumonia.
Future work will be aimed at an automated read out of the hybridization
assay and implementing the sample preparation into a cartridge for
more user friendliness.

Ethics Considerations
The study was approved by the
ethics committee of the Jena University Hospital (Germany), accession
number: 4672-01/16.

Cultivation of Bacteria
In this
study, we investigated
eight different bacterial species, namely, A. baumannii, E. coli, H. influenzae, K. pneumoniae, M.
catarrhalis, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, and S.
pneumoniae. The strains were either purchased from
the Leibniz Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and
Cell Cultures (DSMZ, Brunswick, Germany) or isolates from patients’
samples provided by the Jena University Hospital (UKJ, Jena, Germany).
All species, except from H. influenzae which was raised on chocolate agar with Vitox (Oxoid Deutschland
GmbH), were cultivated on Columbia sheep blood agar (Oxoid Deutschland
GmbH). The spiking of the sputum samples was carried out with cells
from the exponential growth phase. To that end, 5 mL of the liquid
growth medium (further information, see Table 1) was inoculated with a small amount biomass
from an agar plate and incubated overnight at the appropriate temperature.
On the next day, 2–3 mL of the overnight culture was added
to 50 mL fresh growth medium and incubated until the exponential phase
was achieved. The progress was monitored by measuring the optical
density at 600 nm (OD600) using a biophotometer (Eppendorf
AG, Hamburg, Germany). Bacterial cells were harvested when OD600 attained 0.4–0.6. Then 1 mL of the bacterial solution
was centrifuged at 10 000 rcf for 3 min. The supernatant was
discarded and the remaining cell sediment was dissolved in 1 mL phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS). Afterward, a serial dilution from 1:20 up to 1:200 000
was performed and aliquots of 50 μL were plated in order to
determine the colony-forming units (cfu) per mL.

Expanded Glass Beads and Polymer Beads
The EGB were
purchased from Liaver GmbH & Co KG in Ilmenau, Germany. The size
of the particles ranges from 0.5 to 1.2 mm and they have a density
of 0.9 g/cm3. Their surface was modified with primary amine
groups. The modification was a three-stage coating. First, it was
coated with 3-(aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (Sigma-Aldrich, Munich,
Germany) followed by lysine diisocyanate ethyl ester (LDI, Actu-All
Chemicals, Oss, The Netherlands) and finally with a polyetheramine
(JEFFAMINET403, Huntsman Corp., Bergkamen, Germany), each as a solution
in toluene. The polyethylene particles (Ticona GUR 2122) had a size
distribution between 100 and 200 μm and were functionalized
with Lupasol WF (BASF, Ludwigshafen, Germany) and succinic anhydride
as previously described.20 Scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) images of the particles can be found in the Supporting Information (see Figure S6).

et al. 2015, *W
= adenine (A)/thymine (T).

Primer and probes for the target sequence of basC, gad, khe, and ecfX were designed using consensus areas of all target genes and their
alleles. For the target genes fucK, copB, nuc, and lytA the primer sequences
were already published12 and only the hybridization
probes were designed within the aligned amplicon sequences.

Abbott’s in-house primer design software (Abbott (Alere
Technologies GmbH), Jena, Germany) was used to design the primer and
hybridization probes. Special attention was given for highly conserved
regions of each species marker gene to cover all known alleles which
were published at the time as the assay was designed (Juli 2017).
Briefly, all GenBank entries for any given target were retrieved and
one proofed and published entry was selected as the reference sequence
(see accessions numbers, Table 2). The resulting BLAST hits were reannotated and archived
into a local database. Sequences were classified into paralogues and
allelic variants based on their similarity. For this, all matching
regions from the alignments were used for the design of probes and
primers. Sequences were selected which specifically have a similar
GC content, length, and melting temperature. Afterward, all designed
sequences were reblasted against all available target sequences to
rule out false negative or cross-reactive binding events. Subsequently,
probes were modified with an amino-C6 linker and all forward primers
were biotin-labeled for the staining procedure after hybridization
on the chip. The primers and probes were synthetized by Eurofins Genomics
GmbH (Ebersberg, Germany). Detailed information about the used primers
and probes (sequences, melting temperature, and amplicon size) as
well as the target genes (accession numbers) are provided in Table 2.

Asymmetric
PCR
In the present study, an asymmetric
PCR was conducted to amplify a fragment within the respective target
gene region of the bacteria species (Table 2).The primer ratio between biotinylated and
nonbiotinylated primers was 0.2:0.05 μM as determined experimentally
(data not shown). A single reaction mix contained 1 μL cell
lysate, 1× PCR buffer, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.4 mM dNTPs,
0.2 μM of each primer, and 0.1 U/μL Taq Polymerase (innuTaq
DNA Polymerase Kit, Analytik Jena AG, Germany) in a final volume of
30 μL. All PCR reactions were carried out with the thermocycler
FlexCycler (Analytik Jena AG, Jena, Germany). The PCR was performed
with the following cycle profile: initial denaturation at 95 °C
for 300 s, 45 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, and annealing/elongation
at 58 °C for 30 s.

Successful DNA amplification was verified
on a 2% (w/v) agarose gel. For visualization, the DNA was stained
with GelRed (Biotium, Fremont, CA, USA) according to the recommendations
of the manufacturer. The molecular weight marker “GeneRuler
100 bp DNA Ladder” as well as “pUC19 DNA/MspI (HpaII)
Marker, ready-to-use” were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA USA).

Array-Based Hybridization
and Signal Detection
White
planar polypropylene (PP) sheets (Modulor GmbH, Berlin, Germany) were
cut into chip size (17 × 17 mm) by laser, and successively cleaned
in an ultrasonic bath with acetone, ethanol, and water for 10 min
each.

The capture probes (Eurofins MWG Operon, Ebersberg, Germany)
were dissolved in 1× micro spotting solution (ArrayIt Corporation,
Sunnyvale, USA) to a final concentration of 20 μM and spotted
(Nanoplotter 2.1, GeSim, Grosserkmannsdorf, Germany) in an array format
on the PP chips (layout see Figure S7 of Supporting Information). A biotin-labeled noncomplementary probe was immobilized
as a process control to verify the binding of streptavidin enzyme
and the subsequent silver deposition (=positive control). Another
noncomplementary probe was spotted to exclude unspecific binding (=negative
control).

The specific biomolecule interaction on the chip was
realized as
previously described by Schwenkbier et al.25 Briefly, 70 μL of hybridization solution (20 μL asymmetric
PCR product in 3× SSC/0.5% SDS) was incubated on the PP chip
surface for 1 h at 50 °C, followed by 30 min of incubation with
the streptavidin–horseradish peroxidase (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie
GmbH, Taufkirchen, Germany; 1:1000 diluted in 1× PBS with TWEEN
20, PBST). Afterward, the PP chips were washed with PBST and tap water.
Finally, the enzymatic silver deposition was performed by applying
the EnzMetTM HRP detection kit (Nanoprobes Inc., Yaphank, USA; components
A–C). The generated silver nanoparticles in case of a positive
reaction served as robust endpoint signals allowing an immediate visual
readout by the naked eye. In addition, the amount of silver deposits
was quantified by their gray values. The respective spots were scanned
(ProScan 7200, reflecta GmbH, Rottenburg, Germany) and analyzed using
the software ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, USA). After inversion
of the image, the gray value could potentially range from 0 (white)
indicating a clear chip surface without any deposition of silver to
255 (black). The gray value was determined by mean gray value calculation
(at least 10 spots with a size of 2 pixels each), subtracting the
measured background values from the sample values. The gray mean value
of the biotin-positive control was set at 100% and the gray value
signals of the capture probes were presented as gray value percentage
of the positive control. The mean gray values of the negative controls
plus three times the standard deviation were used to set the threshold
for a positive test result.
