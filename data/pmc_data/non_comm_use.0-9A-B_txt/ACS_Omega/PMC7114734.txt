Zero-mode waveguide
(ZMW) nano-apertures milled in metal films
were proposed to improve the Förster resonance energy transfer
(FRET) efficiency and enable single-molecule FRET detection beyond
the 10 nm barrier, overcoming the restrictions of diffraction-limited
detection in a homogeneous medium. However, the earlier ZMW demonstrations
were limited to the Atto 550–Atto 647N fluorophore pair, asking
the question whether the FRET enhancement observation was an artifact
related to this specific set of fluorescent dyes. Here, we use Alexa
Fluor 546 and Alexa Fluor 647 to investigate single-molecule FRET
at large donor–acceptor separations exceeding 10 nm inside
ZMWs. These Alexa fluorescent dyes feature a markedly different chemical
structure, surface charge, and hydrophobicity as compared to their
Atto counterparts. Our single molecule data on Alexa 546–Alexa
647 demonstrate enhanced FRET efficiencies at large separations exceeding
10 nm, extending the spatial range available for FRET and confirming
the earlier conclusions. By showing that the FRET enhancement inside
a ZMW does not depend on the set of fluorescent dyes, this report
is an important step to establish the relevance of ZMWs to extend
the sensitivity and detection range of FRET, while preserving its
ability to work on regular fluorescent dye pairs.

Introduction
Single-molecule Förster resonance
energy transfer (smFRET)
is a highly sensitive approach to investigate intra- and intermolecular
distances on the nanometer scale,1 revealing
dynamics information about biomolecular structures and interactions.2,3 However, the energy transfer efficiency quickly vanishes when the
donor–acceptor separation grows, making smFRET measurements
highly challenging at distances above 10 nm.4,5 Extending
smFRET to large biomolecular constructs requires the use of elaborated
donor–acceptor constructs, and several strategies have been
investigated using lanthanides,6−8 quantum dots,9,10 multicolor-cascaded
systems,11,12 gold nanoparticle quenchers,13−15 metal-induced energy transfer,16,17 or multiple
fluorophores.18−20 Because they do not rely on the organic fluorescent
dye pairs conventionally used in smFRET such as Cy3–Cy5, for
instance, these advanced approaches further complicate the sample
preparation and data analysis. For many applications, it would be
desirable to extend the smFRET range using regular fluorophore pairs.

Since the studies by Purcell and Drexhage,21,22 it is established that the fluorescence emission decay rate is not
only determined by the molecular structure but also depends on the
photonic environment surrounding the molecule. The presence of a mirror
(or a more elaborated optical component) can affect the fluorescence
decay kinetics and the fluorescence lifetime. In a conceptually similar
fashion, the dipole–dipole interaction leading to FRET can
also be influenced by the photonic environment in some cases.23−26 This opens a broad field of research using mirrors,27−31 microcavities,23,26,32,33 nano-apertures,34−40 nanoparticles,41−48 nanogap antennas,49−53 or hyperbolic metamaterials.54,55 Tuning FRET with nanophotonics
can potentially overcome the 10 nm barrier in diffraction-limited
confocal microscopes while still using conventional fluorophore pairs.
However, reaching an enhancement of the FRET efficiency requires a
delicate balance between the FRET rate and the other donor radiative
and nonradiative processes,47,48,51,55 while in many cases, the FRET
efficiency can end up being quenched by the nanophotonic element.27,33,48,50,51

We have recently shown that nano-apertures
milled in an opaque
aluminum film [the so-called zero-mode waveguides (ZMWs)56,57] can improve the FRET efficiency and enable smFRET detection beyond
the 10 nm barrier.58 ZMWs are promising
devices to perform smFRET on large biomolecular constructs with conventional
dyes. However, the demonstration was so far limited to Atto 550–Atto
647N FRET pairs.58 Both of these fluorescent
molecules bear a positive charge after DNA labeling and have been
found to be quite hydrophobic.59,60 They also bear a higher
affinity for glass or metal surfaces, which was observed for Atto
550 and Atto 647N dyes as compared to their cyanine or Alexa Fluor
counterparts.59−62 Although care was taken in our previous work to properly passivate
the ZMW surface,58,62 we cannot fully exclude that
the observed enhanced FRET could be related to this specific choice
of the FRET pair from Atto dyes.

Here, we build on the methodology
previously developed for smFRET
inside a ZMW58 and explore the enhancement
of smFRET efficiency for the Alexa Fluor 546–Alexa Fluor 647
donor–acceptor pair. This FRET pair, although spectrally quite
similar to the Atto 550–Atto 647N pair, has a markedly different
chemical structure and behavior (Figure 1a). Both Alexa 546 and Alexa 647 feature
a negative charge once labeled to DNA, while Atto 550 and 647N dyes
have a positive charge. It was observed that these Alexa dyes are
more hydrophilic than their Atto counterparts59,60 and that Atto 550 and 647N could induce surface adhesion of the
DNA molecules while Alexa 546 and 647 did not.62 To assess the relevance of ZMWs for smFRET enhancement,
it is thus necessary to quantify their performance for a clearly different
set of dyes than the Atto 550–Atto 647N pair used so far.35,36,50,58 Our new measurements for Alexa 546–Alexa 647 smFRET inside
aluminum ZMWs demonstrate enhanced smFRET efficiencies at separations
exceeding 10 nm, confirming the earlier conclusions drawn with Atto
dyes. The detailed characterization reported here is an important
step to establish the relevance and validity of ZMWs to extend the
FRET detection range. As an additional advantage, all the smFRET measurements
in the ZMWs are performed at 100 nM concentration, which is thousand-fold
more concentrated than the conditions typically used for confocal
detection. This brings smFRET analysis closer to physiological concentrations.63,64

pulses. (c,d) Scanning electron microscopy images of the pattern with

Results and Discussion
The FRET
sample consists of double-stranded DNA molecules of 51
bp length, labeled with a single Alexa 546 donor and a single Alexa
647 acceptor. The donor–acceptor distance is fixed to 30 or
40 bp depending on the DNA construct (see the Methods section for the detailed DNA sequences and sample preparation).
These fluorescent dyes feature a different surface charge and hydrophobicity
as compared to Atto 550 and Atto 647N. Alexa 546 and Alexa 647 bear
a negative charge after covalent linking to DNA, whereas Atto 550
and 647N have a positive charge (Figure 1a). A quantitative distinction between the
hydrophobicity found for Alexa and Atto dyes can be done by comparing
their distribution coefficient log D, with D denoting the ratio of the solute concentration in a nonpolar
and polar solvent. Positive values of log D indicate
hydrophobicity (Atto 550 and Atto 647N have log D values of 6.41 and 3.26, respectively), while negative values demonstrate
hydrophilicity (Alexa 546 and Alexa 647 have log D values of −1.43 and −4.26, respectively).60

Our experiments monitor the FRET events
stemming from individual
molecules diffusing across the detection volume (Figure 1b). To clearly quantify the
FRET efficiency and avoid the issues related to incomplete fluorophore
labeling, we implement pulsed interleaved excitation (PIE) using two
alternating laser excitations to excite the donor and acceptor dyes
in a sequential manner.65,66 PIE allows to postselect
the events corresponding to an active FRET pair, where both dyes are
fluorescent, and discard all the cases where only the donor is present.

The main difference as compared to a conventional diffraction-limited
microscope is the use of ZMW nano-apertures to confine the light into
attoliter volumes.56,57 The ZMWs used here are milled
in a 100 nm-thick aluminum film with a diameter of 110 nm (Figure 1c,d). Although the
use of Atto 550–Atto 647N dyes requires the ZMW to be passivated
with a silane-modified polyethylene glycol in order to avoid surface
adsorption of the DNA molecules,62 for
Alexa 546–Alexa 647, we find that similar results can be obtained
with and without the surface passivation step. This additional advantage
of the Alexa FRET pair further simplifies the experimental preparation.

Figure 2 shows typical
fluorescence time traces recorded with the confocal setup and with
a 110 nm-diameter ZMW. In order to ensure that the fluorescence bursts
correspond to single molecules passing through the observation volume
and to have a negligible probability to observe more than one molecule,
we use a low concentration of the DNA sample: 100 pM for confocal
and 100 nM for ZMWs. Brighter detection events are directly obtained
with the ZMW (Figure 2d–f) as compared to the confocal reference (Figure 2a–c), which illustrates
one specific advantage of the fluorescence enhancement occurring inside
ZMWs as an improvement for the net detected fluorescence brightness.67 We analyze the total fluorescence time trace
using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) to compute the temporal
autocorrelation and estimate the average number of emitters and their
average brightness. Following our previous studies,58,67 this quantifies the fluorescence brightness enhancement factor for
isolated donor and acceptor molecules. For Alexa 546, we find a gain
of 11.4 ± 0.9 in a 110 nm ZMW, while for Alexa 647, the enhancement
is 15.9 ± 1.2. The fact that a higher enhancement is observed
for the red dye is mostly related to the lower quantum yield of the
dye (33% for Alexa 647 and 79% for Alexa 546), as low quantum yield
emitters lead to the observation of higher enhancement factors.68

Figure 2 Fluorescent time traces of single Alexa 546–Alexa
647 FRET
pairs with 13.6 nm (40 bp) separation diffusing in the confocal setup
(a–c) and in a 110 nm-diameter ZMW (d–f) with a 0.5
ms binning time. The traces (a,d) show the donor emission after donor
direct excitation at 557 nm, the traces (b,e) show the acceptor emission
after acceptor direct excitation at 635 nm, and the traces (c,f) show
the FRET emission (acceptor fluorescence) after donor excitation at
557 nm. The fluorescence enhancement in the ZMW directly leads to
brighter detection events (d–f) as compared to the confocal
reference (a–c) without any postprocessing.

Using these fluorescence time traces (the total length is
120 s
and accumulates over 2000 detection events), we apply the standardized
smFRET analysis protocol detailed in ref (1) (see Methods for details).
After the PIE postselection, we compute the FRET efficiency (EFRET) for each burst, taking into account the
donor crosstalk, the acceptor direct excitation, and the different
quantum yields and detection efficiencies between the dyes. The influence
of the ZMW is fully taken into account by calibrating the correction
parameters for each ZMW independently. The aluminum ZMWs used here
are optically weakly resonant components, which do not noticeably
modify the fluorescence spectrum of the dyes. Therefore, as we detail
in the Methods section, most correction parameters
(for crosstalk and direct excitation) are unchanged in the ZMW as
compared to the confocal case.

Figure 3a,b compares
the smFRET efficiency histograms for the Alexa 546–Alexa 647
construct with 40 bp separation (corresponding to an average D–A
distance of about R = 13.6 nm) for the confocal setup
and the ZMW. For this D–A separation, which is about twice
the R0 = 7.4 nm Förster radius
for this FRET pair, the average FRET efficiency in the confocal case
is only 3.8 ± 0.3%. To estimate the uncertainty σaverage on the average FRET efficiency, we apply the classical formula , where σ is the standard deviation
of the Gaussian distribution fit and N is the total
number of detected bursts (typically 2000). Using the Förster
formula 1/(1 + (R/R0)6) gives a 2.5% estimate for the average FRET efficiency in
the confocal case for the 40 bp separation. However, this approach
is limited by the uncertainties on both R and R0 and the assumption of perfectly random orientation
for both dyes, which may not be fully verified by our real sample.
Thanks to the optical confinement occurring in the ZMW, the FRET efficiency
is improved up to 8.5 ± 0.2% inside the 110 nm ZMW. Moreover,
the full statistical distributions are clearly different, and smFRET
is better detected in the ZMW case thanks to higher average FRET efficiencies
and narrower distributions. In the confocal case, the standard deviation
of the Gaussian distribution (Figure 3a,c) is 12%, while it is reduced inside the ZMW to
8% thanks to the higher fluorescence brightness.

efficiency between Alexa Fluor dyes inside
a ZMW. (a,c) smFRET efficiency histograms measured in a confocal configuration
for Alexa 546–Alexa 647 FRET pairs with 40 and 30 bp, respectively
(13.6 and 10.2 nm). (b,d) Same as (a,c) recorded in a ZMW of 110 nm
diameter. Black lines are numerical fits with a Gaussian distribution
to determine average FRET efficiency (thick dashed line). The average
FRET efficiency is indicated for each plot, and the error bar corresponds
to one standard deviation of the average value estimate.

We also investigate shorter separations of 30 bp (D–A
distance
≈ 10.2 nm). As the acceptor is brought closer to the donor,
the average FRET efficiency is increased to 7.8 ± 0.3% in the
confocal setup (Figure 3c) and is further enhanced to 11.5 ± 0.2% in the ZMW (Figure 3d). Computing the
gains in the average FRET efficiencies brought by the ZMW, we find
a gain of 2.2× (±0.2) for the 40 bp separation and 1.5×
(±0.1) for the 30 bp case. First, these values demonstrate that
the ZMW can indeed improve the net detected FRET efficiency for Alexa
FRET pairs, which is especially relevant at large D–A separations
exceeding 10 nm where confocal microscopes face their limit of detection.
It was observed previously with nano-apertures,35 nanoantennas,50 and planar microcavities26 that the enhancement factors for the FRET rate
were higher for the samples corresponding to the larger D–A
separations. In other words, the influence of the nanophotonic structure
is more pronounced when the D–A separation is larger. We retrieve
this feature here. The main reason behind this is that the nanophotonic
structure influence on the FRET rate is quite weak as compared to
that on the FRET rate between two closely separated fluorescent dyes
in a homogeneous environment. Therefore, one has to go to D–A
distances greater than 10 nm so that the ZMW relative influence becomes
more prominent.58 Second, we can compare
the results for Alexa and Atto FRET pairs. For Atto 550–Atto
647N, our previous measurements indicated a gain of 2.9× (±0.3)
for the 40 bp separation and 1.2× (±0.1) for the 30 bp case,58 which are quite comparable to the results found
here with Alexa dyes despite their different chemical structures.
This suggests that the smFRET enhancement inside ZMWs does not depend
on the type of fluorescent dyes used.

Independent of the FRET
analysis in Figure 3, the average FRET efficiency can also be
assessed from the reduction of the donor lifetime because of the presence
of the acceptor, using the formula EFRET = 1 – τDA/τD, where τDA and τD are the fluorescence lifetimes of
the donor in the presence and absence of acceptor, respectively.2 This approach importantly provides an independent
control on the estimated FRET efficiencies and does not require any
separate calibration to account for donor crosstalk, acceptor direct
excitation, or quantum yield difference. Figure 4a shows the normalized fluorescence decay
traces for the Alexa 546 donor in the confocal setup and in a 110
nm-diameter ZMW, both with and without an Alexa 647 acceptor. Without
any data processing, it is apparent on the fluorescence decays that
the presence of the acceptor dye accelerates the donor decay dynamics.
This provides a direct evidence for the occurrence of FRET and not
of radiative energy transfer mediated by a propagating photon. The
donor lifetime change due to the acceptor occurs only in FRET where
the dipoles are coupled in the near field via evanescent waves. On
the contrary, the donor lifetime is unchanged when the dipoles are
coupled through radiative transfer, where the energy travels in the
form of a propagating photon and can be funneled by the presence of
a waveguide.69−72 The analysis of the traces in Figure 4a quantifies the τD and τDA lifetimes used to compute the average FRET efficiency (Figure 4b, see details in
the Methods section). An excellent agreement
is found with the results derived from the smFRET histograms in Figure 3a,b, with a difference
of less than 0.4% for both the confocal setup and the ZMW. This further
confirms the validity of our results.

decay traces in confocal
and in a 110 nm-diameter ZMW. Black lines are fits for lifetime traces.
For both ZMW and confocal cases, the presence of the acceptor (FRET
case) further accelerates the donor decay dynamics, which is a clear
signature for FRET. All fit details are summarized in Table 1 and in the Methods section. (b) Intensity-averaged fluorescence lifetimes
deduced from the traces in (a), which allow an independent measurement
of the average FRET efficiency based on the Alexa 546 donor lifetime

Although the various results demonstrate
the FRET enhancement inside
a ZMW of 110 nm diameter, we now investigate the influence of the
ZMW diameter on the energy transfer between Alexa dyes. The same procedure
as for Figure 3 is
applied for ZMW diameters ranging from 80 to 150 nm (Figure 5a). A gradual shift of the
mean FRET efficiency is observed in the distributions, which is summarized
as a function of the ZMW diameter in Figure 5b. Here, the 110 nm diameter used, as shown
in Figure 3, is near
optimum. Using a large diameter, the fluorescence enhancement decreases
and the FRET results tend to retrieve the confocal values. Using a
lower diameter, the quenching losses due to direct energy transfer
to the metal increase, which compete with FRET to the acceptor dye
and reduce the observed FRET efficiency.

line indicates the level found for the confocal reference. The error
bar on the graph corresponds to two times the standard deviation on
the mean FRET efficiency estimate.

Conclusions
Our data demonstrate here that the phenomenon of smFRET enhancement
inside a ZMW is quite general and does not depend on the type of fluorescent
dyes used. Performing smFRET measurements on Alexa 546–Alexa
647 pairs, which feature a markedly different chemical structure,
surface charge, and hydrophobicity, as compared to their Atto 550–Atto
647N counterparts, we retrieve the same conclusions about the quantitative
performance of ZMWs to enhance smFRET. Notably, we could achieve over
a twofold enhancement of the net detected FRET efficiency for dyes
separated by more than 10 nm. This significantly improves the sensitivity
and detection range of smFRET, while preserving the ability to work
on conventional fluorophore pairs. The only difference as compared
to a classical confocal microscope concerns the replacement of the
glass coverslip by a coverslip holding ZMW nano-apertures, which are
easy to fabricate using various lithography techniques. The ZMW confine
the detection volume to the attoliter range, enabling single-molecule
FRET detection at a 100 nM concentration. This 1000-fold higher concentration
for smFRET than with a diffraction-limited confocal microscope is
especially interesting for exploring protein–protein and protein–DNA
interactions, featuring lower affinities.63,64 It should be reminded that the Förster formula 1/(1 + (R/R0)6) is only valid
for a homogeneous medium and can no longer be applied directly in
the vicinity of a nanophotonic structure. Inside a ZMW, both the R0 and the 1/R6 decay
are affected. Although the changes remain minimal for distances below
8–10 nm,35,36 some significant deviations can
be found for D–A distances greater than 10 nm, where the FRET
enhancement becomes important, as demonstrated in this work. Therefore,
preliminary calibrations should be performed in order to enable relevant
distance measurements using FRET in ZMWs (and this work contributes
to it), but conceptually, there is no reason why quantitative distance
measurements would not be possible using FRET inside ZMWs.

Methods
ZMW Fabrication
A 100 nm thick layer of aluminum is
deposited on a clean glass coverslip by electron-beam evaporation
(Bühler Syrus Pro 710).58 The deposition
rate is 10 nm/s at a chamber pressure of 5 × 10–7 mbar.73 Individual ZMWs are then milled
with a gallium-based focused ion beam (FEI dual beam DB 235 Strata)
set at 10 pA current and 30 kV voltage. The gallium ion beam has a
resolution of about 10 nm. ZMWs are cleaned using UV–ozone
during 5 min and rinsed with water and ethanol to remove any organic
impurities before the measurements.

Alexa Dye FRET Samples
The FRET sample consists of
double-stranded DNA with the forward strand being labeled with Alexa
Fluor 546 (donor) and its complementary strand being labeled with
Alexa Fluor 647 (acceptor). The DNA strands are obtained from IBA
life solution (Göttingen, Germany) and are HPLC-purified. The
forward strand sequence of the DNA is 5′-CCT GAG CGT ACT GCA
GGA TAG CCT ATC GCG TGT CAT ATG CTG TTC AGT GCG-3′ where the
thymine at position 44 is labeled with Alexa Fluor 546. The complementary
reverse strand is 5′-CGC ACT GAA CAG CAT ATG ACA CGC GAT AGG
CTA TCC TGC AGT ACG CTC AGG-3′ where the T base at position
47 is labeled with Alexa Fluor 647. In this configuration, we get
a 40 bp separation between donor and acceptor dyes corresponding to
approximately 13.6 nm. For the sample with 10.2 D–A separation
(30 bp), the T base at position 37 is instead labeled with Alexa Fluor
647. The forward and reverse strands are hybridized in a buffer containing
5 mM Tris, 20 mM MgCl2, and 5 mM NaCl at pH 7.5. First,
the mixture is heated at 90 °C for 5 min. Then, the mixture is
cooled down to room temperature for 3 h. The concentration of 100
pM and 100 nM is used for the smFRET measurements in confocal microscopy
and in ZMWs, respectively, in a buffer containing 20 mM Hepes, 10
mM NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 at pH 7.5.

Experimental Setup
The confocal microscope setup has
been detailed in ref (58). Briefly, the Alexa 546 donor is excited at 557 nm using an iChrome-TVIS
laser (Toptica), and the Alexa 647 acceptor is excited at 635 nm using
an LDH laser diode (PicoQuant). Green and red pulses are alternating
at a 40 MHz repetition rate in a PIE configuration,66,74 with 20 μW average power low enough to avoid fluorescence
saturation or photobleaching on the diffusing dyes. Both lasers have
linear polarizations which are set parallel to each other. No polarization
selection is performed on the fluorescence detection. The microscope
objective is a Zeiss C-Apochromat 63× with a 1.2 NA water immersion
objective used in an epifluorescence configuration. For detecting
donor and acceptor fluorescence, two MPD-5CTC avalanche photodiodes
(PicoQuant) are employed together with 50 μm confocal pinholes
and spectral filters (donor fluorescence collection from 570 to 620
nm, acceptor fluorescence collection from 655 to 750 nm). The photodiode
signals are connected to a HydraHarp 400 single photon counting module
(PicoQuant) in a time-tagged time-resolved mode. The overall system
timing resolution is 38 ps (full width at half-maximum).

FRET Efficiency
Measurements
The procedure to compute
the FRET efficiency histograms follows the standard approach in smFRET.1,74 First, we select the single-molecule detection events and separate
them from the background noise, applying a threshold criterion so
that the sum of the signals in donor and acceptor channels exceeds
25 counts per ms for the ZMW (12 counts per ms for the confocal case).
A second threshold is used to check the presence of the red dye upon
the excitation using the red laser. We choose the value at 12 counts
per ms in the acceptor channel with red excitation (3 counts per ms
for the confocal case because of the lower fluorescence brightness).
We ensure that these levels have a negligible influence on the measured
average FRET efficiencies.

The FRET efficiency is then calculated
as1,58 1  where nDgreen and nAgreen are the number
of photons per each burst for the donor and acceptor channel upon
excitation using a green laser, respectively, nAred is the number
of photons in the red channel with the excitation using the red laser.
The numbers of photons are corrected for the background contribution
in each channel. The background counts are measured by performing
a separate experiment using the buffer solution only for the ZMW or
the reference glass coverslip. The equation above contains correction
factors for (1) the crosstalk α fraction of the donor emission
collected in the acceptor detection channel, (2) the direct excitation
δ of the acceptor by the green laser, and (3) the correction
parameter γ which accounts for the difference of the quantum
yields of the dyes (ϕD, ϕA) and
their detection efficiencies between channels (κd, κa).

The crosstalk α is the ratio
between the donor emission leaking
into the acceptor channel as compared to the donor emission in the
donor channel. The crosstalk is determined for the DNA sample containing
only the donor fluorophore: . For all ZMW diameters,
the crosstalk remains
nearly constant α = 0.05 with slight variation for 100 and 150
nm at α = 0.04. We found a similar value for the confocal setup
α = 0.05.

The direct excitation δ corresponds to
the fraction of the
acceptor fluorescence because of direct excitation by the green laser
as compared to the acceptor emission signal by the red laser. This
parameter is measured when a DNA sample containing only the acceptor
dye is excited: . For the confocal reference,
we find δ
= 0.11, which also does not change for ZMW diameters except for the
80 nm ZMW where we have δ = 0.08.

The γ correction
factor takes into account the differences
in the fluorescence quantum yields (ϕD, ϕA) and the detection efficiencies (κd, κa): . For the Alexa 546–Alexa
647 FRET
pair in our confocal setup, we compute γconf = 0.43
± 0.02 from the knowledge of the fluorescence spectrum and quantum
yield of each dye. The photodiode response is also accounted for in
the calculation. Alternatively, the γ correction factor can
also be estimated from the measured stoichiometry S(1) and the average fluorescence brightness
per molecule CRMAred and CRMDOgreen measured by FCS following the approach used in ref (58) 2  where CRMAred is for red excitation of the
acceptor dye
and CRMDOgreen is for green excitation of the sample containing only the donor
dye. Using the measured values of CRMAred = 5000 counts/s for Alexa 647 DNA, CRMDOgreen = 11,000
counts/s for Alexa 546 DNA, and S = 0.46, we find
γconf = 0.39 ± 0.05, in good agreement with
the 0.43 ± 0.02 calculated value.

For the ZMW, γ
is modified because of the different enhancement
factors of the donor and acceptor and is found as35,50,58 3  where EnhCRMAOgreen and EnhCRMDOgreen are the fluorescence
enhancement
factors of the fluorescence count rate per molecule for acceptor-only
and donor-only samples upon a green excitation, respectively, and
EnhCRMAOred is
for red excitation. All the enhancement factors are assessed by FCS
for each ZMW diameter.67 We find γZMW for 80, 90, 110, and 150 nm to be 0.45, 0.65, 0.6, and
0.65, respectively. Except for the 80 nm ZMW (for which a significant
fluorescence quenching is found), the γ correction factor does
not vary much for ZMW diameters from 90 to 150 nm. In contrast to
the case of the Atto 550–Atto 647N FRET pair,58 for Alexa 546–Alexa 647, we find an increase in
the γ correction factor in the ZMW as compared to the confocal
reference (γZMW ≈ 0.65, while γconf = 0.43). According to eq 1, a higher γ value will lead to a decrease in
the FRET efficiency (by increasing the denominator in the fraction).
The net FRET efficiency enhancement observed inside the ZMW (Figures 3 and 5) shows that the gain in the acceptor emission nAgreen is enough
to compensate for the increased γ factor.

Fluorescence
Lifetime Analysis
In addition to the fluorescence
burst analysis in eq 1, the average FRET efficiency can be independently determined from
the donor fluorescence lifetime data. We use the equation EFRET = 1 – τDA/τD, where τDA and τD are the
fluorescence lifetimes of the donor in the presence and absence of
the acceptor, respectively. To determine τDA and
τD, we fit the time-correlated single photon counting
(TCSPC) histograms (Figure 4a) with a reconvolution, taking into account the instrument
response function (IRF), whose full width at half-maximum was measured
to be 38 ps. All the lifetime analysis is performed using the SymPhoTime
64 software (PicoQuant). For the FRET data in Figure 4a, we use the same traces as for the intensity
burst analysis in Figures 2 and 3, leading to an average number
of molecules in the detection volume around 0.1 (concentrations of
100 pM and 100 nM for the confocal and ZMW cases). For the donor-only
TCSPC data, we use 10 times higher concentrations (average number
of detected molecules about 1) to achieve a better signal-to-noise
ratio. As a consequence of the higher background contribution in the
FRET cases, a peak at t = 0 is seen for the FRET
TCSPC data. This peak corresponds to a sum of laser light scattering,
metal photoluminescence, and Raman scattering. This contribution is
interpolated with a fixed 20 ps component (shorter than the 38 ps
IRF resolution) to achieve a complete fitting of the TCSPC decay,
but this contribution is then discarded for the lifetime analysis
as it only corresponds to noise. The background and scattering contributions
are recorded by performing a separate experiment in the same conditions
using only the buffer in the absence of the DNA sample. For the TCSPC
analysis, we ensure that more than 92% of the total detected photons
are considered for the fits. The data for the confocal reference (FRET
and donor only) are fitted with a single exponential decay (excluding
the fixed 20 ps contribution from laser scattering). For the ZMWs,
a biexponential function with fast and slow components provides a
better fit with flat residuals. As observed previously for Atto dyes,58 the fast component converges toward values around
400 ps for both the FRET and donor-only samples inside a 110 nm ZMW.
All the fit parameters are summarized in Table 1. The tail seen for long delay times higher than 5 ns is only
due to the background level, and there is no supplementary long lifetime.
In the ZMW case, the intensity-averaged lifetimes are used to compute
the average FRET efficiency. We find empirically that these values
provide a better match with the separate burst intensity analysis
(Figure 3) than the
amplitude-averaged data. However, our claim of enhanced FRET efficiency
in the ZMW is maintained for all the approaches (intensity-averaged,
amplitude-averaged, or direct comparison between long lifetime components).

a In the case of a biexponential fit,
τ1 and τ2 are the individual lifetimes
of each component and α1 and α2 are
their respective normalized amplitudes. τamp = (α1τ1 + α2τ2)/(α1 + α2) is the amplitude-averaged
lifetime, while τint = (α1τ12 + α2τ22)/(α1τ1 + α2τ2) denotes the intensity-averaged lifetime. The
20 ps scattering peak at t = 0 is not shown here.
