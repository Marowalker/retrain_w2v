A detailed
computational study of the decomposition reaction mechanisms
of cis-propylamine (cis-PA), trans-propylamine (trans-PA), and the cis-isomer
of its protonated form (cis-HPA) has been carried
out. Fourteen major pathways with their kinetic and thermodynamic
parameters are reported. All reported reactions have been located
with a concerted transition state, leading to significant products
that agree with previous theoretical and experimental studies. Among
six decomposition pathways of trans-PA, the formation
of propene and NH3 is the significant one, kinetically
and thermodynamically, with an activation energy barrier of 281 kJ
mol–1. The production of two carbenes is found via
two different transition states, where the reactions are thermodynamically
controlled and reversible. Furthermore, five decomposition pathways
of cis-PA have been considered where the formation
of ethene, methylimine, and H2 is the most plausible one
with an activation energy barrier of 334 kJ mol–1. The results show that the formation of propene and NH4+ from the decomposition of cis-HPA is
the most favorable reaction with an activation barrier of 184 kJ mol–1, that is, the lowest activation energy calculated
for all decomposition pathways.

Introduction
n-Propylamine
(PA) is an aliphatic primary amine
with the chemical formula C3H9N. PA is incessantly
included in organic syntheses, industrial formulation, and biological
processes. In pharmacopeia, PA used as a synthetic precursor for antifungal,1 antimalarial,2 antibacterial,3 antivirals,4 and anticancer5 agents. In the processing of nanomaterials, PA
is utilized in the synthesis,6,7 size8 and morphology9 control, and
functionalization of nanosized products.10 Moreover, PA found applications in the preparation of catalysts,11−13 molecular sieves,14 corrosion inhibitors,15,16 and removal of liquid17 and gaseous18 pollutants. The combustion of PA with fuels
leads to the formation of nitrogenized pollutants, that is, HCN, HCNO,
and NH3.19,20 These pollutants, if emitted,
react with carbonyl oxide (Criegee intermediate) and contribute to
the secondary organic aerosol formation, thus contributing to climate
change.21 The widespread applications of
PA raise the environmental concern about the emitted species during
environmental remediation of PA-containing products.

The decomposition
of both PA and protonated n-propylamine
(HPA) has been the focus of several studies.22−26 The decomposition of PA shows significant chemical
characteristics that require further investigation. The reaction is
homogeneous and apparently unimolecular;26 furthermore, it is the first order and probably a chain one.27 The order of skeletal bond scission probability
is α-CC bond > CN bond >β-CC bond.28 PA has a peculiar property in that it dissociatively ionize
with the production of alkyl-free radicals in addition to methylenimmonium
ion CH2NH2+29 which is considerably stabilized by the formation of C=N
π-bond,30 whereas the NH3 loss, that is analogous to the dehydration of n-propylalcohol, is unfavorable31 due to
the electrostatic repulsion between the terminal heavy atoms.32 In the presence of kaolin,33 the PA is decomposed into hydrogen cyanide (6.6%), propylene
(6.4%), H2 (6.3%), N2 (4.6%), and ethylene (3.0%).
On the silicon Si surface, eight decomposition products were studied
theoretically.25 The formation π-bond-containing
products, alkyl cyanide (activation energy 242 kJ mol–1), alkene (334 kJ mol–1), and imine(343 kJ mol–1), were the most plausible dissociation pathways,
whereas the formation of strained cyclic products, azetidine (467
kJ mol–1), cyclopropane (493 kJ mol–1), and aziridine (506 kJ mol–1), were kinetically
less favorable. The formation of NH3 and H2 is
within acceptable activation energy values of 384 and 400 kJ mol–1, respectively.25 In aqueous
solution, the PA is in equilibrium with HPA. The proton affinity and
the structural change of PA through protonation affect the dissociation
products of HPA.34,35 Experimental studies showed that
it follows three fragmentation patterns corresponding to propene loss,
NH3 loss, and ethane elimination.22,24

There are different experimental factors that affect the fragmentation
pattern of amines, including the activation or fragmentation regime,36 the applied power and time, the internal energies
of the molecular ions,37 and the molecular
weight.38 Collectively, these factors account
for the experimental inconsistency in the reported products, fragmentation
patterns, and intensities. Hence, further understanding is required
on the decomposition reactions of PA (Scheme 1) and HPA (Scheme 2). This shall shed more light on the chemistry
of the decomposition reactions, formed products, and decrease the
uncertainties in the previous literature. Therefore, the goal of this
computational study is to further investigate and study novel pathways
of the dissociation of PA and HPA. Furthermore, the formed products
through different pathways are compared with the reported experimental
data to ensure the results of this work.

Reactions of trans-PA and cis-PA

Results and Discussion
Different gas-phase decomposition
pathways of PA have been studied
to provide more kinetic and mechanistic insights. The studied pathways
are based on previous experimental findings26,27 and further computational consideration is built on chemical intuition
and different discoveries. It is worth noting that all studied decomposition
pathways occur in a concerted step as an endothermic process. The
kinetic parameters (Ea, ΔH⧧, and ΔG⧧) for the investigated pathways are reported herein
at different levels of theory. The plausible pathways that will be
discussed are compared based on the calculated kinetics, the lower
the energy the more plausible the reaction. The reaction coordinates
(R: reactant, TS: transition state, and P: product) are
depicted on a potential energy surface (PES) for related pathways
to define the energies of the most plausible pathways. The α-,
β-, and γ-carbons of PA with respect to the nitrogen atom
are indicated in some pathways, upon discussion, whenever is needed.

Decomposition
of trans-Propylamine
The cis and trans are
conformational isomers; however, both isomers
lead to the formation of different products. A connection between
both isomers through the same pathways has been accounted for; however,
the energy barrier is very negligible. For example, the experimentally
detected cyclic forms of aziridine, azetidine, and cyclopropane are
produced from the cis-isomer while other forms are produced more easily
from the trans. The decomposition of trans-propylamine
(trans-PA) leads to the formation of different products
of propene, carbene (CH3CH2C̈H), imine,
cyclopropanamine, NH3, H2, and CH4. This section examines the formation of these products through six
separate pathways (see Scheme 1 and Figure 1).

Figure 1 Proposed reaction mechanisms for the decomposition of trans-PA (pathways A to C).

One of the most indicated and proposed pathways in the decomposition
reactions is the formation of an alkene and NH3. Herein,
this route of reaction is designated as pathway A, where TSA shows how the C–N and C–H bonds are elongated
to 1.610 and 1.764 Å, respectively, while the C–C bond
length is decreased to 1.483 Å. This dissociation step is a concerted
one step that leads to the formation of propene and NH3 (PA), see Figure 1. The activation energy of TSA is lower
compared to other pathways with a value of 297 kJ mol–1 at B3LYP/6-31G(d). Increasing the Gaussian functions to B3LYP/6-311++G(3df,3pd)
decreased the energy barrier to 283 kJ mol–1, that
is, in agreement with the lower calculated value of 281 kJ mol–1, at CBS-QB3. The thermodynamic parameters indicate
that the reaction is endothermic by 39 kJ mol–1 and
endergonic by 16 kJ mol–1 at CBS-QB3. The calculated
activation energies are given in Table 1 at different levels of theory.

Another
significant route is producing CH4, which can
be generated through two different reaction mechanisms. For example,
pathway B occurs from the trans-PA while
another different mechanism of pathway J (discussed in
a further section) is initiated from the cis-propylamine
(cis-PA), generating different coproducts. Pathway B involves the dissociation of the terminal γ-carbon
through TSB with a bond length of 2.362 Å from the
β-carbon, followed with a simultaneous proton transfer with
a length of 1.202 and 1.392 Å approaching the γ and away
from the β-carbon, respectively (Figure 1). Interestingly, this step produces a carbene
(C̈HCH2NH2) and CH4 as final
products (PB). However, compared to pathways B and C, the reaction is not kinetically favored because
of the high calculated energy barriers of 404 kJ mol–1 at B3LYP/6-31G(d), 388 kJ mol–1 at B3LYP/6-311++G(3df,3pd),
and 391 kJ mol–1 at CBS-QB3. The high energy barrier
could be attributed to the formation of the carbene where the carbon
is sp-hybridized. However, the lower activation energy values of TSC via pathway C mark that this is not the main
case because another carbene of CH3CH2C̈H
with NH3 as a coproduct (PC) is formed with
respective values of 349, 330, and 329 kJ mol–1 at
B3LYP/6-31G(d), B3LYP/6-311++G(3df,3pd), and CBS-QB3, respectively
(Table 1). The carbene
in pathway C is formed through the detachment of the
C–N bond length of 1.684 Å with a simultaneous proton
transfer from the α-carbon of 1.459 Å to the amino group
forming PC. It is worth noting that based on the PES
of Figure 3, pathways B and C are thermodynamically reversible. The
carbenes most probably will react with other species in the atmosphere
as they are very reactive and unstable.

The formation of an
imine and H2 (pathway D) through the decomposition
of trans-PA via TSD occurs with a single
step by the removal of H2 from PA with lengths of 1.560
and 1.437 Å. Simultaneously,
the C=N imine bond is formed where the C–N bond decreased
by about 0.8 Å to become 1.387 Å, see Figure 2. Likewise, pathway E signifies
the formation of prop-2-en-1-amine and H2 (PE) through TSE. However, the kinetic scenario is different
in favorability where the former (TSD) is more favorable
than the latter (TSE) at different levels of theory.
The activation energy values for TSD are lower than TSE by 29, 14, and 22 kJ mol–1 at B3LYP/6-31G(d),
B3LYP/6-311++G(3df,3pd), and CBS-QB3, respectively. Moreover, enthalpies
and Gibbs energies of activation are lower, significantly favoring
pathway D than E, refer to Table1. Furthermore, thermodynamically,
pathway D is more favorable with lower parameters (ΔE, ΔH, and ΔG) and by 71 kJ mol–1.

Figure 2 Proposed reaction mechanisms
for the decomposition of trans-PA (pathways D to F).

Ultimately, the formation of cyclopropanamine and H2 through a different decomposition route, pathway F,
undergoes TSF in a cyclization step. C–C bond
with a length of 2.577 Å and hydrogens secession from the α-
and γ-carbons of 2.735 and 2.109 Å, respectively. The hydrogen
attached to the α-carbon is distinct from the γ with a
length longer by about 0.6 Å, and this is attributed to its C–N
bond that leads to a higher steric factor. However, in terms of energy,
this reaction mechanism and formed products (PF) are
not kinetically favored. Table 1 shows that for pathways F and E (producing H2), the activation energies are higher than
the other investigated pathways at different levels of theory. For
instance, the calculated energy barrier for the TSF value
of 406 kJ mol–1 at CBS-QB3 is the highest among
the other transition state energies. Interestingly, the thermodynamic
calculations of this reaction mechanism are more favored than the
other trans-PA H2-producing pathways D and E. The respective enthalpy and Gibbs energy
values of 83 and 65 kJ mol–1 are more favored than
for pathways D and E by about 7 and 74 kJ
mol–1, respectively. This result sheds more light
on the mechanism of how H2 is produced more favorably through
pathway D and further helps in explaining why the cyclopropanamine
and propenamine are not experimentally detected. The relative energies
of a PES for the investigated decomposition pathways of trans-PA are given in Figure 3. It is worth noting that increasing the
polarization and diffuse functions at B3LYP/6-311++G(3df,3pd) decreased
the energies of all pathways, and the calculated energies for all
TSs are consistent to CBS-QB3 by no more than 5 kJ mol–1 difference.

Figure 3 PES of the decomposition of trans-PA,
pathways A to F, calculated at CBS-QB3.

Decomposition of cis-PA
The decomposition
of cis-PA, as other separate pathways occur, is due
to the geometry of the PA; in which the trans-PA
cannot undergo these reaction mechanisms and vice versa. Furthermore,
the decomposition from both stereoisomers to form H2 proves
that the yield of 6.3% cannot be neglected and might be more than
expected.33 For example, TSG through pathway G is a different one that leads to
the formation of prop-1-en-1-amine and H2 (similar to pathway E but with geometric isomerism). However, bond lengths and
activation energies of TSG differ from TSE; this is attributed to the terminal alkene that is being formed
in TSE which is less sterically hindered than TSG. The hydrogens dissociate from the α and γ-carbons with
lengths of 2.445 and 1.186 Å with a forming C=C double
bond of 1.448 Å, see Figure 4.

Figure 4 Proposed reaction mechanisms for the decomposition of cis-PA (pathways G, H, and I).

The more favorable formation
of TSE rather than TSG is also confirmed
through the activation energies, where
it is higher in the latter by about 88 kJ mol–1at
different levels of theory (Table 2). The activation energy value of 499 kJ mol–1 at B3LYP/6-31G(d) decreased to 481 kJ mol–1 at
B3LYP/6-311++G(3df,3pd). Moreover, the calculations at CBS-QB3 are
in agreement with both levels with a value of 489 kJ mol–1. However, it is worth noting that thermodynamically, pathway G is more plausible with lower enthalpy and Gibbs energies
by about 34 and 40 kJ mol–1 at different levels
of theory.

As for the cyclic products, three
significant pathways (H, I, and J) with different transition states
were determined. Pathway H, where cis-PA decomposes to azetidine and H2 (PH), undergoes a reaction
mechanism of C–N bond formation of 2.084 Å and H2 dissociation from the nitrogen atom and γ-carbon of 1.052
and 2.341 Å, respectively. However, the barrier heights of 500,
494, and 492 kJ mol–1 (Table 2) are higher than the previously reported
value of 467 kJ mol–1, and this referred to the
fact that Cho and Choi25 studied the decomposition
pathways on a silicon surface. It should be noted that the cyclic
formation pathways are indicated here according to their relevance.
Moreover, in order to avoid repetition, the more plausible transition
states are purely described while other ones are indicated by comparison
and relevance.

Although the cyclopropane is more hindered than
azetidine, it is
found to be more favored in terms of energies, where the TSI barrier is lower than TSH, see Table 2. Furthermore, it is more thermodynamically
favored with lower energies by about 100 kJ mol–1 at the reported levels. Thus, the presence of a nitrogen atom in PH alters the chemical reaction of electron delocalization
from PI, which is also confirmed from the decomposition
to aziridine and CH4 through TSJ (pathway J), see Figure 5. This indicates that TSJ is more plausible than TSH; hence, pathway J is more favored kinetically
and thermodynamically than H.

Figure 5 Proposed reaction mechanisms
for the decomposition of cis-PA (pathways J and K).

The more favored TSI forms the cyclopropane
and NH3 (PI) through the dissociation of the
amino group
from the α-carbon of 2.104 Å with simultaneous proton transfer
from the γ-carbon of 2.003 Å. This is accompanied by a
C–C bond formation of 2.292 Å, corresponding to the cyclopropane
formation, through TSI, with an activation energy of
435 kJ mol–1 at B3LYP/6-31G(d). The calculated results
at B3LYP/6-311++G(3df,3pd) and CBS-QB3 levels of theory are consistent
with energy barriers of 414 and 416 kJ mol–1, respectively.
Furthermore, Table 2 shows that the energy values of decomposition to aziridine with
CH4 (TSJ, Figure 5) and cyclopropane with NH3 (TSI) are lower than the previously reported values25 of 506 and 493 kJ mol–1, respectively.

The calculated activation energies of TSI are lower
than TSH and TSJ, see Table 2. Thus, among the cyclic formation pathway,
pathway I is the most plausible one. However, this does
not mean that the other products are not formed because the decomposition
reactions occur at very high temperatures that aid in the formation
of different unexpected products. Moreover, studying the decomposition
reaction and its modeling on other cluster surfaces increases the
expectation of forming other products by acting as a catalyst surface
for these reactions, considering the fact that also some products
undergo further unimolecular or bimolecular reactions, leading to
the formation of other products.

An interesting novel decomposition
reaction, pathway K, that leads to the formation of ethane,
methanimine, and H2 is found to be kinetically more favored
than other pathways. The
reaction parameters shown in Figure 5 depict the concerted step, TSK, of C–C
and H2 dissociation. The former belongs to an α-
and β-carbon length of 2.308 Å, while the latter belongs
to 1.447 and 1.602 Å from the nitrogen and γ-carbon, respectively.
This change in bond lengths is accompanied by the formation of imine
with 1.319 Å and C=C double bond of 1.381 Å (PK). Extensive efforts to find a step-wise mechanism of this
reaction to check with the bond lengths and energy barriers were considered;
however, all efforts lead to the concerted one. It should be noted
that the product geometries of pathway K are obtained
at B3LYP/6-31G(d) because we were unable to locate the final products
(PK) at B3LYP/6-311++G(3df,3pd) and CBS-QB3 levels of
theory.

The kinetic scenario fulfills a reputable reaction barrier
of the
investigated decomposition reaction of cis-PA, where
the calculated activation energies are the lowest compared to other
pathways, see Table 2. The activation energy value of 343 kJ mol–1 at
B3LYP/6-31G(d) is lower than range off other pathways and further
improvement of basis sets conformable to the B3LYP/6-311++G(3df,3pd)
level of theory decreased the barrier by 10 kJ mol–1. This value is also consistent with CBS-QB3 calculated energy barrier
value of 334 kJ mol–1. Thus, pathway K is considered the most plausible pathway with lower activation energies
at different levels of theory. This is also given in Figure 6 as a comparative PES of the
investigated pathways at CBS-QB3. This reaction mechanism may also
be the indicated sink reaction for the formation of H2 because
it has a yield of 6.3%, along with the experimentally detected ethylene
with its yield of 3.0%.36 This also shows
the probabilities of H2 and other product formation through
different decomposition reactions. It should be noted here that the
barriers at B3LYP/6-311++G(3df,3pd) are comparable to CBS-QB3, differing
by no more than 8 kJ mol–1.

Figure 6 PES of the decomposition
of cis-PA, pathways G to J, calculated at CBS-QB3.

Decomposition of cis-HPA
The selection
of the cis-isomerism of HPA rather than the trans is based on the
investigated pathways (L, M, and N), in which it is possible to locate the desired transition states
and products from the cis. This is based on our efforts to locate
other transition states to find other pathways from the trans-isomer,
which all leads to the investigated pathways of L, M, and N. The protonation is on the amino group
(NH2) of PA that leads to the formation of an ammonia (NH3+) group, that is, a significant moiety for proton-related
reactions as it will be discussed in this section.

The momentum
of the ammonia group (NH3+) of HPA is proton
releasing to α-, β-, or γ-carbons, which results
in different kinetics, thermodynamics, and bond parameters. Pathway L shows the proton transfer from NH3+to γ-carbon with a length of 1.816 Å, followed by a simultaneous
proton transfer of 1.553 Å from the γ- to β-carbon
via TSL, see Figure 7. Interestingly, this step led to the formation of
a hydrogen bond bridge between the β- and γ-carbons (PL), where the positive charge is located on the CH2 group (as shown in Scheme 2). Despite our extensive efforts, we were unable to locate
a TS of the dissociation of the hydrogen bound complex
that produces the desired products. Therefore, we believe that, at
this state, the reaction proceeds to the hydrogen bound complex (the
located product on the PES) with a higher energy barrier which makes
it a kinetically unfavorable step and it is not worth investigating
more. On the other hand, the barrier heights for TSL are
relatively lower than the investigated decomposition pathways of cis- and trans-PA, where the barriers are
277, 265, and 269 kJ mol–1 at the B3LYP/6-31G(d),
B3LYP/6-311++G(3df,3pd), and CBS-QB3 levels of theory (Table 3), respectively, particularly
because these energies are significantly lower than other CH4-forming pathways of B and J by about 197
kJ mol–1. However, for pathway L, the
PES in Figure 8 shows
that the reaction is thermodynamically reversible with low product
energies relative to the transition states.

for the decomposition of cis-PA (pathways G, H, and I).

As mentioned earlier, there are considerable
pathways of H2 production. For example, pathway M describes
the formation of H2 through dissociation of the hydrogen
bonds from the NH3+ and β-carbon with
bond lengths in the range of 1.519 Å through TSM (Figure 7). Furthermore,
this step of TSM leads to the formation of protonated
propanimine (PM) with an imine consistent with other
pathway bond length of 1.387 Å. However, the calculated energy
barrier of TSM is exceedingly high, in comparison to
other steps, with a value of 332 kJ mol–1, at B3LYP/6-31G(d).
Further calculations at B3LYP/6-311++G(3df,3pd) and CBS-QB3 lower
the energy barriers to 311 and 317 kJ mol–1 (Table 3), respectively. Relative
energies of this pathway compared to other ones are given in a PES
of Figure 8, where
the reaction is endothermic and exergonic by 77 kJ mol–1.

Essentially, the production of ammonium cation (NH4+) along with propene is the most anticipated reaction
mechanism
of cis-HPA because of the presence of the galvanizing
nitrogen moiety toward having the additional hydrogen. The reaction
is initialized via TSN by the nitrogen dissociation followed
with the hydrogen abstraction from the β-carbon with bond lengths
of 2.291 and 1.521 Å, see Figure 8. The latter bond (N–H) formation has a bond
length of 1.473 Å, that is, higher than the other N–H
bond formation by about 0.4 Å. Furthermore, this concerted step
is accompanied with the C=C double-bond formation with a bond
length of 1.378 Å. The reaction is considerable with the lowest
activation energies of all investigated pathways, making TSN the most plausible transition structure with an activation energy
of 197 kJ mol–1 at B3LYP/6-31G(d). Further addition
of polarization and diffuse functions led to a decrease in the energy
barrier by 16 kJ mol–1. This is in agreement with
the complete basis set method, CBS-QB3, the value of 184 kJ mol–1, refer to Table 3. Thus, based on the calculated energies and relative
to other pathways (Figure 8), the reaction is kinetically favored and the most plausible
pathway, forming propene and NH4+ (PN). It should be mentioned that the barriers at B3LYP/6-311++G(3df,3pd)
are comparable to CBS-QB3 differing by no more than 6 kJ mol–1.

Conclusions
A thorough computational study of the gas-phase
decomposition of
PA and its protonated form has been detailed using density functional
theory (DFT) and CBS-QB3 methods. Fourteen different pathways have
been investigated; six for trans-PA, five for the cis-PA, and three for the cis-HPA. The
kinetic and thermodynamic parameters have been reported at different
levels of theory. Each desired reactant, transition structure, and
product have been optimized and ensured its connection to the related
pathway at different levels of theory. Two pathways have been considered
to lead to the carbine formation with different reaction energies.
Different decomposition pathways that lead to the formation of H2 along with significant products of propene, CH4, NH4+, and imine have been studied, compared,
and reported, kinetically and thermodynamically. The most favored
(energetically) pathways in the investigated decomposition reactions
are A (281 kJ mol–1), K (334 kJ mol–1), and N (184 kJ mol–1) of trans-PA, cis-PA, and cis-HPA, respectively. Furthermore, three
different pathways (B, C, and L) with thermodynamic reversibility were located and studied. Further
unimolecular and bimolecular reactions are expected to occur and affect
the energy barrier of the decomposition of PA, along with the need
for further understanding of HPA decomposition chemistry because it
leads to different products.

Computational Methods
All of the
electronic structure
calculations have been considered using the Gaussian 09 quantum package.39 Geometries were initially optimized by employing
the hybrid method of Becke’s three-parameter using the LYP
functional (B3LYP),40,41 utilizing the 6-31G(d) basis
set.42 Further calculations by increasing
the Gaussian functions corresponding to B3LYP/6-311++G(3df,3pd) were
considered; this is to test the effects of polarization and diffuse
functions on the energy barrier and ensure the reliability of calculations.
Moreover, single-point energy calculations were employed using the
more accurate method, CBS-QB3.43 The selected
methods are also based on our previous studies of the decomposition
pathways of different amines.19,44−47

Minimum energy stationary points were located and defined
by first optimizing the geometries of the minima and saddle points.
Analysis of the harmonic vibrational frequency of minima showed no
imaginary frequency, while the transition state shows only one negative
imaginary frequency in the Hessian matrix for the desired reaction
pathways. Further analysis of transition states via the intrinsic
reaction coordinate48 at B3LYP/6-31G(d)
ensured the connection of the desired points for each proposed mechanism.
Each reaction pathway is depicted on the PES along with the reacting
points. The PES formulates the calculated activation energies relative
to the initial reactive complex, which draws more conclusions on the
investigated reaction pathways. All relative energies of optimized
geometries were corrected with zero-point vibrational energies. The
calculated activation energies (Ea) are
reported at 0 K, while enthalpies of activation (ΔH⧧) and Gibbs energies of activation (ΔG⧧) are at 298.15 K.

B3LYP/6-31G(d)
is the most commonly used functional, however, it
still misses the long-range dispersion effect and van der Waals interactions.
Furthermore, the accurate prediction of energy barriers, as well as
the kinetics, is still a challenge to the B3LYP functional and DFT
methods. Hence, the utilization of the composite method, CBS-QB3,
comes in handy; due to the accurate description of energy barriers.
Increasing the Gaussian functionals, corresponding to B3LYP/6-311++G(3df,3pd),
produces energy values in qualitative agreement with the CBS-QB3 calculations,
within no more than 8 kJ mol–1. This indicates that
the B3LYP/6-311++G(3df,3pd) level of theory performs well to this
system; however, further and different functionals should be used
in future studies to describe the pyrolysis/decomposition reactions.
