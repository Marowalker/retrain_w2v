Herein, eco-friendly
iron titanate nanoparticles, FeTiO3 (FT), derived from
natural resources (like ilmenite sand) were coated
onto cotton fabrics (CF) to develop smart textile with enhanced UV-shielding
property. The FT nanoparticles were dispersed in a polyurethane (PU)
matrix, and the resulting nanocomposite was coated on CF. In addition,
few sandwich architectures were designed by rationally stacking CF
coated with PU and FT nanoparticles. The resulting sandwich structures
blocked UV rays mainly by absorption. FT nanoparticles were comprehensively
characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy,
transmission electron microscopy, UV–vis, vibrating sample
magnetometer, and thermogravimetric analysis. FT was suitably surface-functionalized
to enhance the quality of dispersion in PU, thereby facilitating effective
coating on CF. The latter was systematically evaluated by microscopic
and spectroscopic techniques. In addition, flammability of the coated
CF was evaluated and the char was assessed to gain insight into the
fire-retardant properties. Interestingly, CF coated with FT exhibited
a strong UV-shielding ability in sharp contrast to CF coated with
PU. Further, the sandwich architecture consisting of CF with FT and
PU resulted in an increase in the ultraviolet-protecting factor value
to >50 compared to only PU-coated CF. Our results indicate that
the
sandwich structure holds excellent promise in the quest of designing
smart textiles with enhanced UV shielding.

Introduction
Cotton fabrics (CF)
have been used in various applications for
their outstanding properties like softness, biodegradability, and
breathability, but they suffer from certain limitations like prone
to bacterial attack, poor UV shielding, and flammability.1−3 In recent years, ceramics (TiO2, SiO2, ZrO2, MgO, ZnO) and polymeric materials have been used to coat
the fabric to enhance their functional properties.4−6

The physical
and optical properties of perovskites have been used
in a number of applications like electronics, electro-optics, etc.7−10 Perovskites are one of the most important crystallographic families
with general stoichiometry of ABX3.11 Oxides (ABO3)12,13 and metal
trihalide perovskites (CsPbX3; here, X = Cl, Br, and I)14 have recently gained wide interest in electronics,
photovoltaics, nanotechnology, and biotechnology industries.15−17 Oxides of ABO3 type, with A being a metal, B being titanium,
and O being oxygen, have gained wide attention due to their applications
in different technologically relevant fields.11−13 Interestingly,
perovskite metal oxides exhibited a variety of interesting physical
properties, including ferroelectric, dielectric, pyroelectric, and
piezoelectric behaviors.10 During the past
decades, composite materials such as transition/rare-earth metal-doped
perovskite materials (ABO3) have been prepared and studied
for their unique properties.13

The
composition of a naturally occurring sand, ilmenite (with a
general formula of MTiO3), including metals (M) such as
nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co), zinc (Zn), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), and
copper (Cu) among others, has been assessed for its unique optical
properties.18−22 Among these, iron titanate (FeTiO3 (FT)) is one of the
most common minerals and is well known as a feedstock for industrial
production of TiO2.23,24 Ilmenite is economical,
abundant, and can be found in various geographical locations, including
America, Australia, India, Europe, Asia, and Africa.25 It is weakly magnetic,23 exhibits
a wide band gap (2.58–2.9 eV), and finds application in visible
light antiferromagnetic semiconducting materials with a Neel temperature
of around 52 K. The wide band gap of FT makes it a potential candidate
for spintronic devices, optoelectronics, high-temperature integrated
circuit, high-power electronic devices, and photocatalyst activities.26−28 The rhombohedral crystal structure of titanates possess diverse
properties.20,26

In recent times, a variety
of nanocomposite-based textile products
have been studied for flame-retardant, wettability, and sustainable
UV-blocking applications.2−5 Recent research focuses on the development of functional
textiles using polymeric materials or biomolecules.4,6,29 In this regard, attempts have been made
to incorporate nanoparticles in fabrics, which may be readily achieved
with a specific polymer using some coating techniques, such as pad-dry
cure method,30 dip coating,31 in situ polymerization method,32 knife over roll method,33 etc.

Herein, polyurethane (PU), which exhibits excellent adhesion quality,
is used to coat the surface of the fabrics. Attempts have been made
to surface-coat the CF with various nanomaterials like Ag/TiO2,3232 graphene,34 TiO2,6 and diammonium hydrogen phosphate35 for electrical conductivity, UV blocking, antibacterial
effect, flame-retardant property, etc. In addition, various surface
functionalization techniques on the nanoparticle surface have been
reported to homogeneously disperse in PU4,6,36 for coating onto the fabrics.

In this study,
an eco-friendly and facile approach of coating perovskites
on CF is designed to enhance the fire-retardant and UV-blocking properties
of the textile. To achieve this, naturally derived FeTiO3 nanoparticles were prepared by acid extraction method from ilmenite
sand. The microstructures and morphology of the FT nanoparticles were
well characterized. PU solution containing FT nanoparticles was prepared
via in situ polymerization method and coated onto CF by dip-coating
method. The coating of PU and FT/PU composites onto CF is a facile
and industrially viable route for coating at large scales. The resultant
fabrics were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) to assess the surface morphology and thermal stability,
respectively. The limited oxygen index (LOI), wettability, and UV-blocking
properties were investigated systematically. Taken together, this
study opens new avenues in the smart textile domain with enhanced
UV protection.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis and Characterization
of FT Nanoparticles
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of
FT nanoparticles is shown
in Figure 1a. All of
the observed peaks matched with the standard JCPDS file 01-075-1211,37 and the peak positions at 2θ = 24.9, 32.69,
35.47, 40.81, 48.61, 54.18, 62.58, and 64.10°, corresponding
to (012), (104), (110), (023), (024), (116), (124), and (300) planes
are evident. It is confirmed that the prepared FT nanoparticles are
rhombohedral and no impurities were found in the XRD pattern. The
average crystallite size is calculated using the Debye–Scherrer
equation to be ca. 30 nm. The surface morphology of the prepared nanoparticles
is analyzed by SEM. The globular-shaped morphology of the nanoparticles
with an average size of 100 nm can be seen from Figure 1b. The quantitative energy-dispersive spectrometry
(EDS) analysis reveals the elemental composition of the samples, which
consists of Fe, Ti, and O, and is shown in Figure 1c. The weight fractions of all elements (Fe,
Ti, and O) are determined from EDS and are presented in the table
shown in the inset of Figure 1c. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image shows
that the particles are mostly agglomerated (Figure 1d). The obtained concentric ring in the selected
area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (inset of Figure 1d) shows that the diffraction
pattern confirms the crystalline nature of the prepared FT particles.

pattern, (b) SEM, (c) EDS, and (d) TEM (inset, SAED pattern)
images of FeTiO3 nanoparticles.

The hysteresis loop of FT nanoparticles is shown in Figure 2a (from −20
to 20 kOe),
and the expanded view from −100 to 100 Oe at 300 K is shown
as inset. The observed results show that M–H loops do not saturate even up to 20 kOe, which is due
to the paramagnetic or antiferromagnetic nature of the material.38 Magnetic parameters like saturation magnetization
(Ms), remanent magnetization (Mrs), and coercivity (Hc) are obtained from hysteresis loops, which are measured at
(0, 0) point as 0.11 emu/g, 0.062 emu/g, and 67 Oe, respectively.
Squareness ratio and anisotropy constant are also determined from
the above-mentioned equation, and the resultant values are 0.56 and
7.52 Oe, respectively.

FT nanoparticles.

To confirm the decomposition
of FT nanoparticles, TGA was carried
out. A three-step (a–c) degradation is observed for FT nanoparticles,
which is shown in Figure 2b. In step (a), a weight loss of ca. 9.6% is observed at 496
°C, which could be ascribed to the evaporation of residual organic
matter in the material. A dominant weight loss of ca. 7.079% is observed
between 496 and 782 °C in step (b), which is attributed to the
oxidation of carbon to form volatile species, such as CO and CO2. In step (c), FT nanoparticles completely decomposed. The
amount of FT nanoparticles is calculated to be ca. 83% from TGA.

Figure 3a shows
UV–vis absorption spectra of FT nanoparticles measured at room
temperature. A strong absorption is observed around 310 nm. This indicates
that the FT nanoparticle suspension retains a high ability to absorb
UV light. The transmittance spectrum of FT nanoparticles is also shown
in Figure 3a, and an
average transmittance of 95% is observed in the visible region. It
confirms that the transmission of FT nanoparticles is completely blocked
in the wavelength range of 230–310 nm. The direct band gap
of FT nanoparticles can be calculated by Tauc plot, which is shown
in Figure 3b. Eg can be obtained by extrapolating the linear
portion of the plot to the photon energy axis where (αhυ)2 = 0. The calculated direct band gap
is found to be 2.9 eV, which is in good agreement with 2.9 eV reported
for FeTiO3.23

and transmittance and (b) band gap.

Surface Analysis of UC and Coated Fabrics
For direct
comparison, the surface morphologies of coated (PUC, FTPC) and UC
fabrics are analyzed by SEM, as shown in Figure 4a–f. The recorded SEM image of UC
fabric (Figure 4a)
is shown at lower magnifications. From the SEM images, it is observed
that PU is covered on the fabric surface. Moreover, extended network-like
structure of FT particles appears on the surface of the cotton fibers,
as observed in Figure 4e. EDS measurements are carried out to confirm the elemental composition
of coated and UC fabrics, and the results are summarized in Figure 4b,d,f. The EDS analysis
shows that C and O elements are present in the FTPC fabrics along
with Fe (06.69 wt %) and Ti (07.06 wt %).

and the corresponding EDS images of UC, PUC,
and FTPC.

Structural and Wettability
Studies of Cotton Fabrics
The crystallographic nature of
UC and coated (PUC and FTPC) cotton
fabrics are investigated by XRD, and the results are shown in Figure 5. Typical diffraction
peaks of cellulose I fibers (JCPDS file no. 03-0226) were observed
at 2θ = 15.4, 16.8, and 23.1°, which can be indexed to
(101), (101), and (002) planes, respectively. It is observed that
the diffraction peak of cotton fabrics is similar to that of PU-coated
fabrics because of the amorphous nature of polyurethane.39 Nevertheless, the FT nanoparticles are adhered
to the surface of fabrics, as is evident from Figure 5. On the other hand, the FTPU-coated fabrics
exhibited peaks at 27, 48.5, and 67.3°. This observation indicates
that the FT nanoparticles are accumulated on the surface of the cotton
fabrics.

Figure 5 XRD patterns of all coated and uncoated fabric samples.

The surface wettability property of coated and
UC fabrics is evaluated
from the static contact angle of water on its surface, as shown in Figure 6. It can be seen
that the water droplet is completely absorbed on UC fabric (Figure 6a) due to the hydrophilic
nature of cotton (water contact angle (WCA) angle = 0°), which
is ascribed to the −OH group of cellulose and its weave structure.40 After coating with PU, the surface of the coated
fabrics becomes rough and the contact angle for PUC fabrics remains
unaltered (Figure 6b), as the water droplet flattens. In Figure 6c, the contact angle for FTPC fabric is observed
to be 86.2°, due to the presence of hydrophobic silane coupling
agent41 on the surface of FT nanoparticles.
This hydrophobicity in the organically modified FT nanoparticles might
lead to an enhancement in the dispersion of FT nanoparticles.

Evaluation of Thermal Decomposition Behavior of UC and Coated
Fabrics
Flammability of textile materials is well understood
by describing their burning behavior, in particular, easiness of ignition
and sustained burning after ignition. An effectual flame-retardant
action is specified by the high thermal stability and char residue
for coated and UC fabrics. Thermal decomposition behaviors like weight
loss and residual char of the UC and coated cotton fabrics are comprehensively
investigated by TGA, and the results are depicted in Figure 7a and Table 1. As seen in Figure 7a, TGA of the cotton fabric shows a three-step
decomposition process. In the initial stage, the fabric is decomposed
due to the evaporation of water and char formation from the amorphous
region of cellulous fiber. In the second stage (230–460 °C),
the decomposition of residue from the carbonization process is manifested.
The thermal degradation of the char occurs in the last stage (460–800
°C and above 800 °C), where the complete decomposition or
oxidization or ignition of the carbonaceous species is expected.42 Here, the UC fabric is completely degraded.
In Figure 7a, the initial
weight loss of the degradation of UC cotton fabric is observed to
be 5% below 100 °C. This weight loss may be attributed to the
removal of moisture. The major weight loss of UC fabrics begins at
300–700 °C, as shown in Figure 7a.

Figure 7 (a) TGA measurements, (b) char residue at 650
°C, (c) LOI
test, and (d) relation between char residue and LOI of all coated
and uncoated fabric samples.

Table 1 TGA Data for All Coated and UC Fabrics
and LOI Value
s. no.	samples	Tmax1 (°C)	Tmax2 (°C)	Tmax3 (°C)	residue at 650 °C (%)	LOI (vol %)	
1	UC	237	335	542	8.33	19.8	
2	PUC	240	336	478	13.30	19.9	
3	FTPC	259	339	593	14.03	21.1	
The data in Table 1 show that the degradation of cellulose species leads to the formation
of residue of all fabrics. In contrast, the coated cotton fabric has
a higher Tmax with respect to the UC cotton
fabric (Table 1) due
to the presence of FT nanoparticles. Compared to that of the UC fabric,
the Tmax1 values of the PUC- and FTPC-coated
cotton fabrics obtained are found to be higher, 240 and 259 °C,
respectively. The obtained results revealed that the FT nanoparticles
can accelerate the dehydration and char formation of the coated fabrics.
This is advantageous for reducing volatile species during combustion
and preventing underlying materials from further burning. The major
weight losses of UC, PUC, and FTPC fabrics were recorded at 335, 336,
and 339 °C respectively.

In addition, the formation of
the residue at 650 °C, which
corresponds to the weight loss of all of the fabric samples, is shown
in Figure 7b and Table 1. In particular, FTPC
fabric induces a large amount of char residue compared to PUC and
UC fabrics. This result indicates that the enhancement of thermal
stability of the coated fabrics significantly improved their fire-resistant
performance compared to UC fabric.

Flammability Performance
of UC and Coated Fabrics
LOI
evaluates the flame-retardant properties of coated and UC fabrics.42 In this test, a mixture of N2 and
O2 is passed through a cylindrical heat-resistant glass
chimney containing fabric samples clamped vertically from the bottom.
A Bunsen burner is used to ignite the sample from the top. The minimum
amount of oxygen needed to ignite the sample is noted and is reported
as LOI. Basically, textile materials are considered to be easily flammable
and flame-retardant materials when LOI values fall in the range of
23% and above.43 All of the coated and
UC fabric samples have been tested, and the results are listed in Table 1 and Figure 7c. The LOI values of the UC,
PUC, and FTPC fabrics are found to be 19.8, 19.9, and 21.1%, respectively.
Therefore, the LOI values of all coated fabrics are found to be higher
than the control UC fabric (Table 1). From the results of thermal degradation (TGA) and
LOI, it is evident that the % of char residue at 650 °C and the
minimum concentration of oxygen (vol %) required to ignite the sample
support the flame-retardant property of coated fabrics. This observation
is shown in Figure 7d.

Assessing the Surface Morphology of Fabric Samples after LOI
Test
A detailed investigation of the morphology of the char
is carried out by SEM, as shown in Figure 8. For UC fabrics, the combustion of the fabric
shows complete degradation and the fiber weave structure is apparent
(see Figure 8a). In
contrast, the residue obtained from the coated fabric (Figure 8b,c) suggests that the weave
structure is preserved. Remarkably, the residue of FTPC also suggests
that the interlace structure of fibers is well preserved compared
to that of PUC and UC, as inferred from Figure 8c. It is envisaged from the SEM images that
the incorporation of FT into cotton fabrics can remarkably increase
the stability and compactness of the fiber. It is clearly seen from
the SEM images that the coated fabrics retained the interweave structure,
which can be attributed to FT nanoparticle and PU matrix on the surface
of the fabrics. Moreover, the ignition temperature of coated fabrics
was higher due to the addition of FT nanoparticles. Hence, the structure
and stability of FTPC fabrics suggest that they exhibit excellent
fire-retardant properties and can be further explored for commercial
applications.

Assessment of UV-Shielding
Properties of UC and Coated Fabrics
The shielding properties
of UC and coated (PUC and FTPC) cotton
fabrics against UV radiation are analyzed in the wavelength range
of 280–400 nm, as shown in Figure 9. The average transmittance percentage of
UC fabrics is ca. 77% for both UV-A and UV-B. As seen in Figure 9, the blocking percentage
of the coated fabrics indicates minor transmittance of UV radiation
compared to UC fabrics. The blocking % of coated fabrics shows that
the percentage of blocking UV-B radiation is higher than that of UV-A
(see Table 2). The
PUC fabrics show higher UV blocking, ca. 90%, because of reflection
and little absorption, compared to UC fabrics. On the other hand,
the reduction in transmittance is observed in FTPC fabrics. Here,
FeTiO3 nanoparticles aid in strong UV absorption ability.
It is interesting to note that the blocking % of FTPC fabric is higher
than PUC fabrics.

Figure 9 UV-blocking property: (a) transmittance spectra of all
coated and
uncoated fabric samples and (b) scheme of sandwich structure of coated
fabrics.

Table 2 UV Blocking % of
All Coated and UC
Fabrics
s. no.	fabric	T (UV-A) (%)	T (UV-B) (%)	% blocking UV-A	% blocking UV-B	UPF
value	
1	UC	22.8	24.11	77.2	75.82	12	
2	PUC	14.54	5.84	85.46	94.16	467	
3	FTPC	0.23	0.06	99.77	99.94	1218	
4	PFTPC	0.05	0.05	99.95	99.95	2000	
According to AS/NZS 4399:1996 standard, a ultraviolet-protecting
factor (UPF) value of >50 indicates excellent protection against
UV
radiation. The resultant UPF values of all fabric samples are listed
in Table 2. The UPF
value of coated fabric is much higher than 50, which reveals higher
blocking of UV radiation.

Additionally, the sandwich layer of
the coated fabrics for UV-shielding
applications is shown in Figure 9a. The schematic representation of the layered coated
fabrics is shown in Figure 9b. The UV-blocking percentage and UPF of sandwich fabrics
(PFTPC) are 99.9% and 2000, respectively, where the former is similar
to the UV-blocking percentage of FTPC fabrics. Therefore, PFTPC fabric
can be used as a UV-shieldable material. To check the UV shielding
of recent synthetic materials like functionalized carbon nanotube
(CNT),44 we coated CNT with PU onto cotton
fabrics. The composite-coated fabrics were then evaluated for UV-shielding
ability (see Figure S1). In Figure S1a, the UV transmittance properties of
CNPC and the sandwich layer of FTPC and PUC along with CNPC fabrics
are measured in the wavelength range of 280–400 nm. Table S1 lists UPF values and blocking percentage
of UV transmittance in the wavelength ranges of 280–315 and
315–400 nm for UV-B and UV-A, respectively. The results indicate
that excellent UV-shielding property is exhibited by PU/acid-functionalized
CNT-coated fabrics (inset of Figure S1a) and the blocking percentage is 92%, which is higher than that of
the PUC fabric but lower than that of FTPC fabrics. Therefore, although
CNT has strong UV absorption ability and is used as a blocking agent
against UV radiation, our results indicate that eco-friendly material
derived from natural resources can block UV more efficiently. In general,
CNT has a large band gap (10–50 eV) and the electrons that
absorb the photon energy go to the excited state and produce a pair
of electrons and holes. This results in effective absorption of UV.45−47

Additionally, the sandwich layer of the coated fabrics is
shown
in Figure S1, which is used for UV-shielding
applications. The shielding mechanism of the layered coated fabrics
shows excellent UV-blocking properties, as shown in Figure S1b. Furthermore, the intermediate layer of CNPC fabrics
placed between two layers of PUC fabrics also exhibited better UV-shielding
property than CNPC fabrics. Additionally, FTPC fabrics inserted in
the PCNPC fabrics were also evaluated for UV-shielding performance.
The observed results indicate that PFCPC fabrics also showed excellent
UV-blocking ability compared to PCNPC and PFTPC. The sandwich fabrics
(PFTPC, PCNPC, and PFCPC) showed higher UPF than polymer-coated fabrics
(FTPC > CNPC > PUC) and UC fabrics.

Taken together, our
study reveals that eco-friendly and naturally
derived FT nanoparticles can block UV effectively compared to other
synthetic blocking agents. Further, when these coated fabrics are
rationally stacked, the UPF values are significantly higher compared
to single layer. Thus, the results presented here suggest that FT-coated
fabrics can be a potential candidate for UV shielding in textile,
optoelectronics, and packaging applications.

Conclusions
In summary, FeTiO3 nanoparticles were successfully synthesized
by acid extraction method and systematically characterized. The band
gap of FT nanoparticle was determined to be 2.9 eV, and the VSM results
indicated that FT nanoparticles show antiferromagnetic properties
at room temperature. A composite mixture of FT nanoparticles and PU
solution was prepared by in situ polymerization method and coated
onto cotton fabrics. The FTPC fabrics showed higher LOI values compared
to other coated and UC fabric samples. FTPC formed a layer wrapping
around the cotton fabrics to protect them from being damaged by heat
and glow. Moreover, the intrinsic UV-blocking property of FT nanoparticles
resulted in excellent UV protection in the coated fabrics. Few sandwich
structures consisting of PU coating and FT resulted in excellent UV-blocking
performance and showed higher UV-blocking ability compared to single
layers. Thus, our results indicate that naturally derived FT nanoparticle-coated
CF can block UV effectively and can further be explored for myriad
applications.

Experimental Details
Materials
The
ilmenite ore used in this study was obtained
from Tamil Nadu, India. Bleached and mercerized cotton fabrics (116
ends/84 picks) with a weight (15 × 15 cm2) of 138.84
g/m2 were commercially obtained and used as substrate.
4,4-Methylene bis(p-phenyl isocyanate) (MDI, Mw = 250 g/mol), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 29–34 wt %), and (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane
(99%, APTS) were procured from Sigma-Aldrich. Poly(ethylene glycol)
(PEG, Mw = 4000 g/mol) was obtained from
SLR Chemicals, India. Analytical-grade sulfuric acid (H2SO4), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), and N,N-dimethylformamide
(DMF) solution were procured from SD Fine Chemicals Limited.

Synthesis
of Precursors from Raw Ilmenite
Raw ilmenite
was used as the starting material for this synthesis process. The
obtained ore was subjected to digestion with concentrated H2SO4 (about 98% GR) at 300 °C for 3 h in a muffle
furnace. The resulting dry cake of the mixture was allowed to cool
to room temperature. After digestion, it was leached using deionized
(DI) water to yield a water-soluble iron titanium sulfate solution,
which is shown in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Precursor Preparation from Ilmenite Sand
Synthesis of FT Nanoparticles
The precursor solution
prepared above was used as a base material to synthesize FeTiO3 nanoparticles (see Scheme 2). The obtained iron titanium sulfate precursor solution
(500 mL) was taken in a 1000 mL beaker and stirred vigorously at 700
rpm. Then, the reducing agent (25 mL of ammonia) was added dropwise
into the precursor solution and maintained at pH 7. Later, the obtained
solution was centrifuged at 10 000 rpm and the particles were
collected. The collected particles were kept in a hot air oven at
80 °C for 12 h, followed by annealing at 450 °C for 3 h.
Finally, reddish brown FT nanoparticles were obtained and were used
for further investigations.

Scheme 2 Synthesis of FeTiO3 Nanoparticles
Characterization of FT
Nanoparticles
The crystalline
phase of FT nanoparticles was characterized by X-ray powder diffraction.
The measurement was obtained using a X’Pert PRO X-ray diffractometer
with Cu Kα (λ = 1.54 Å) radiation. The morphology
and purity of the FT nanoparticles were characterized using a scanning
electron microscope equipped with an energy-dispersive spectrometer
(SEM-EDS, Ultra 55). The FT nanoparticles were dispersed in ethanol
using an ultrasonic bath drop-cast directly on a carbon-coated copper
grid for transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Titan Themis 300 kV)
analysis. Thermal analysis was carried out using a thermogravimetric
analyzer from TA Instruments.

Magnetic responses of the FT nanoparticles
were measured at room temperature using a Lakeshsore vibrating sample
magnetometer (JDM-13) with an applied force of −8000 to 8000
Oe. To get further information about the magnetic properties of the
FT nanoparticles, the squareness ratio and anisotropy constant (K) were calculated using the following equation48    where Mr is the
remanent magnetization; Ms is the saturation
magnetization; and Hc is the coercivity.

The optical properties (absorption spectra) were recorded using
a UV–vis–NIR spectrometer (Shimadzu MPC3600). The optical
band gap energy (Eg) was obtained from
the absorption coefficient (α), which was calculated from the
transmittance spectra of FT nanoparticles. The optical band gap energy
(Eg) is given by  where A is a constant, hυ is the photon energy, and α is the absorption
coefficient.

Synthesis of OH-Functionalized FeTiO3 Nanoparticles
To hydroxylate the FT, 1 g of FT nanoparticles
was dispersed in
a 400 mL aqueous solution of H2O2 by bath sonication
for 15 min. After bath sonication, the suspended solution was refluxed
at 106 °C for 4 h, followed by washing with deionized water in
sequence for several times. The H2O2-treated
FT was then dried in an oven at 80 °C for 24 h and stored in
desiccators.

Synthesis of NH2-Functionalized
FeTiO3 Nanoparticles
The as-prepared hydroxylated
FT nanoparticles
were refluxed again in the presence of APTS at 80 °C for 24 h.
Centrifugation of the obtained mixture followed by washing with toluene
for several times to remove the excess APTS yielded FT-NH2, which is denoted as f-FT. Finally, the solvent
was evaporated under vacuum.

Synthesis of f-FT/PU Nanocomposite
The composite mixture of f-FT/PU was synthesized
by a two-step process, as shown in Schemes 3 and 4, using MDI, PEG 4000, and f- FT. In the
first step (polymerization), MDI was reacted with PEG 4000 at a molar
ratio of 2:1 under N2 atmosphere with DMF at 80 °C
for 3 h. The reaction was constantly stirred with a mechanical stirrer
in an oil bath. In the second step, a certain amount of f-FT nanoparticles was predispersed in 20 mL of DMF by ultrasonication,
followed by bath sonication for 15 min, and then the obtained solutions
were added into the prepolymer of PU in an oil bath under N2 atmosphere with vigorous stirring at 80 °C for 3 h.

Coating of Cotton Fabrics
The cotton fabrics (15 ×
15 cm2) were treated by 10% of NaOH under a rotational
speed of 200 rpm for 1 h at 60 °C. This treatment was carried
out to hydrolyze the surface of the cotton fabrics. The fabrics were
then cooled to ambient temperature, thoroughly rinsed in ethanol,
washed with deionized water to remove all of the residual NaOH, and
subsequently dried at 60 °C for 30 min.

The PU and f-FT/PU nanocomposites were coated on the cotton fabrics
by dip-coating (Scheme 5). Separately, the fabrics were submerged in the PU and N-FT/PU emulsion
for 10 min under ultrasonication. The coated fabrics were placed between
two filter papers and gently pressed, which may remove the excess
solution from the coated fabrics. Further, the coated fabrics were
kept in a drier at 120 °C for 15 min to cure the coating on the
fabrics. Finally, the polymer nanocomposite was coated on the coated
fabrics.

Scheme 5 Preparation Route of PU- and FT/PU-Coated Fabrics
The uncoated, f-FT/PU-coated, and PU-coated fabrics
are referred to as UC, FTPC, and PUC, respectively, in this study.
The average thicknesses (according to the ASTM D1777-96 standard)
of the obtained coated fabrics were about 0.29 and 0.28 mm for FTPC
and PUC, respectively, which were higher than the average thickness
of the UC fabrics (0.21 mm). The variation of the thickness increased
due to the adhesion of nanoparticles in polymeric materials on the
surface of the fabrics.

Characterization of Fabric Samples
The morphological
analysis was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, ULTRA
55) with an acceleration voltage of 10 kV. Before analysis, the fabric
samples were sputtered with gold using a sputter coater. The physical
structure of the fabric samples was examined by XRD (X’Pert
PRO, PANalytical) with Cu Kα radiation generated at 40 kV (λ
= 0.1542 nm) and 30 mA.

The coated and UC fabrics were evaluated
indirectly by measuring the static water contact angle by the sessile
drop method with an OCA 15EC instrument (DataPhysics) at room temperature
and 65% relative humidity. The instrument consists of a CCD video
camera with 768 × 576 pixel resolution to capture images at a
rate of up to 50 per second. The wettability was achieved when 3.0
μL of DI water was drop tended to be static on the surface of
the fabric samples for nearly 1 min. Each sample was analyzed several
times and the values were recorded.

The thermal degradation
properties of the fabric samples were assessed
using a thermo analyzer (TA Instruments) from 30 to 800 °C at
a heating rate of 20 K/min under nitrogen and air.

All fabric
samples were tested by LOI using a specimen size of
13 × 4 cm2. For LOI, the samples were supported vertically
in a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen flowing upward through a transparent
chimney. The LOI values were measured in accordance with the ISO 4589
Part 2 standard test method on a digital oxygen index apparatus (Concept
Equipments, U.K.).

The UV transmittance of the coated and UC
fabrics was measured
by Labsphere UV 1000F. The UV protection factor (UPF) was calculated
according to Australian/New Zealand Standard, AS/NZ 4399:1996.49 The UV-blocking value of the fabrics was calculated
using mean percentage of transmission in the UV-A (315–400
nm) and UV-B (280–315 nm) regions according to AS/NZS 4399:1996.
