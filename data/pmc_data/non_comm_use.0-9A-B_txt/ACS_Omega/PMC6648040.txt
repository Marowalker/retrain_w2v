Here, we propose an easy method for
site-selective deposition of
two-dimensional (2D) material flakes onto nanoholes by means of electrophoretic
deposition. This method can be applied to both simple flat nanostructures
and complex three-dimensional structures incorporating nanoholes.
The deposition method is here used for the decoration of large ordered
arrays of plasmonic structures with either a single or few layers
of MoS2. In principle, the plasmonic field generated by
the nanohole can significantly interact with the 2D layer leading
to enhanced light–material interaction. This makes our platform
an ideal system for hybrid 2D material/plasmonic investigations. The
engineered deposition of 2D materials on plasmonic nanostructures
is useful for several important applications such as enhanced light
emission, strong coupling, hot-electron generation, and 2D material
sensors.

Introduction
In the last decade,
there has been an increasing interest in the
investigation of two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as graphene
and various transition metal chalcogenides.1−5 Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), in particular,
which consists of S–Mo–S layers bonded by van der Waals
interactions is noted. MoS2 offers a powerful platform
for applications in nanophotonics and optoelectronics due to its remarkable
optical properties.6,7 Moreover, monolayer MoS2 can also be integrated with other low-dimensional materials such
as quantum dots,8 nanowires,9,10 and other 2D materials11,12 to form hybrid nanostructures
with intriguing electronic and optical properties.

Regarding
the latter, extensive interest from researchers has been
focused in the last few years on exploring the potential of these
physical phenomena, especially light–matter interactions, such
as multiexciton photoluminescence, interlayer exciton coupling, strong
coupling, and the valley polarization effect.13−17 However, controlling the optical properties of a
MoS2 layer(s) is still a great challenge and significant
efforts are still required. The active control of MoS2 can
be, in principle, achieved by utilizing photonic and plasmonic nanostructures.18−23 However, one of the main limitations of MoS2 application
in photonics and plasmonics is related to the challenge of aligning
nanostructures with the 2D material. New approaches for easy and controlled
integration of 2D materials with metallic or semiconductor nanostructures
are now of great importance in various fields of research. We have
recently proposed and demonstrated the possibility to control the
deposition of single-layer MoS2 flakes on metallic nanostructures
by means of chemical conjugation.24 Here,
we propose an alternative approach that we demonstrate can be applied
to any substrates comprising nanoapertures, decorating them with MoS2 flakes as either a single or few layers. As we will show,
the procedure is based on electrophoretic deposition (EPD) where the
substrate does not act as an electrode. This method allows for high
yield deposition onto both flat nanostructures and three-dimensional
(3D) elements.

We surmise that the structures that can be easily
prepared with
this method can find several interesting applications in all of the
present fields of research in which 2D materials are the core. Such
examples include: enhanced light emission,13,21,25−30 strong coupling from plasmonic hybrid structures,17 hot-electron generation,31,32 and 2D material
sensors in general.33−38

Results and Discussion
An illustration of the deposition
process can be found in Figure 1 (top panel). A microfluidic
chamber containing two platinum (Pt) electrodes at the anode and cathode
sides has been used to perform the EPD (see Supporting Information SI#1). The chamber has been designed to place
a 1 × 1 cm2 sample that acts as a separation membrane
between the two sides. The distance between the two electrodes (designed
with a size of 1 × 1 cm2) is about 5 mm. MoS2 flakes obtained from a chemical exfoliation process39−41 (see Methods) and suspended in H2O are injected through a microchannel in the cathode side, whilst
the anode side is filled with the solvent (in our case H2O).

electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs of gold nanohole arrays decorated
with MoS2 flakes by means of EPD (2 V–5 min); (b)
EPD with full coverage (15 V–5 min). Insets: details of deposited
flakes.

The EPD can be performed, thanks
to the non-zero electrophoretic
mobility (μe) of the MoS2 in (H2O) solution. The μe of MoS2 flakes measured
by dynamic light scattering (DLS; Malvern Zetasizer nano ZS) is −3.10
± 0.03 μmcm/Vs (Table 1). In particular, the software measures the electrophoretic
mobility of the flakes and by means of Henry’s equation the
values of ζ (ζ-potential) are calculated considering parameters
related to the environmental conditions such as the dielectric constant
(ε), viscosity (η) of the solvent, and Henry’s
function (f(ka))  Once the charged MoS2 flakes
are
dispersed in water, ions of the opposite charge will be absorbed at
the surface forming a layer of strongly adhered ions (Stern layer),
which becomes a diffuse and dynamic layer comprised of a mixture of
ions with the increasing distance from the surface. Until a certain
distance from the surface, these ions will move with the particle
(slipping plane). The ζ measured is related to the potential
existing between the surface and the slipping plane. Both Stern and
diffuse layers form the electric double layer (EDL), which determines
the electrical mobility of the flakes in suspension under an electric
field measured by DLS.57 Several studies
can be found in the literature where EPD is achieved in organic solvent,39 but to achieve an effective and efficient EPD
additives are often added to the nonaqueous solvent.40,41 As MoS2 flakes are found to be stable in water, this
avoids unnecessary complexity in altering the organic solution when
the material can just be diluted in aqueous solvents.

EPD has been already proposed for
MoS2 nanosheet deposition
for several applications.42−44 With respect to the previously
reported cases, here, the substrate where the flakes are deposited
is not used as an electrode. In contrast, the nanoholes present in
the substrate allow for the through-flow of ions, whilst also representing
a barrier to the MoS2 flakes, which cannot pass due to
their size and are deposited. An illustration of the setup for EPD
can be found in Figure 1 (top panel) and a summation of the stages of the process are given
here. The nanohole array prepared on a Si3N4 membrane (see Methods) is first cleaned
in oxygen plasma for 60 s to facilitate the deposition. The sample
in the ground state is placed in the microfluidic chamber and the
chamber sides are filled with MoS2 suspended in H2O and distilled H2O, respectively. A suitable voltage
for the required deposition thickness is then applied for 5 min to
allow for electrophoretic deposition. The chamber is then opened,
and the deposited final sample is rinsed with EtOH. Theoretically,
this method can be used on any nanostructure comprising a nanohole
as we have verified here on planar and 3D metallic nanohole arrays
as well as dielectric (Si3N4) nanoholes. In
the case of large rectangular arrays of metallic nanoholes, the substrate
is a Si3N4 membrane coated with a 100 nm thick
gold film, where holes of 100 nm in diameter were prepared by means
of focused ion beam (FIB) lithography.

To compare the effectiveness
of EPD with a simple drop cast deposition,
we dropped 20 μL of MoS2 in H2O on a gold
nanohole substrate and let it dry, with a final rinse in EtOH. As
expected (see SI#2), the resulting substrate
was found to be randomly coated, though a large number of holes are
decorated with flakes. In our first EPD experiments, we observed that
site-selective deposition is possible using a relatively low applied
voltage (2 V). Nevertheless, this did not lead to 100% coverage of
the nanoholes array and to low reproducibility of the process (as
illustrated in Figure 1a). We considered MoS2 degradation as a potential cause
of the low reproducibility and checked by performing different ζ-potential
measurements simulating aging effects (see SI#3). To improve the % of coverage to include all of the nanoholes in
the array, we performed EPD while increasing the applied voltage up
to 15 V. Figure 1a,b
illustrate how, in this way, a full coverage could be easily obtained.

Once we demonstrated the proof-of-concept for controlled decoration
of nanohole arrays, we investigated the applicability of this method
to the case of 3D structures (Figure 2a–d). The fabrication of 3D plasmonic structures
comprising a nanochannel/nanohole has been shown for different designs
and materials in several recent papers.45−47 The main advantage of
these particular structures is the possibility to confine and enhance
the electromagnetic field (e.m.) in a narrow gap at the apex of the
structure. With respect to a nanohole on a flat metallic film, the
e.m. field enhancement can be significantly higher and the integrated
nanochannel can also act as a nanofluidic element.24

by means of EPD. (a, b) 15 V applied voltage, 5 min; (c, d) 25 V applied
voltage, 5 min; (b, d) details of deposited flakes.

Examples of electrophoretic deposition of MoS2 flakes
over these substrates are reported in Figure 2. As has already been stated, the vertical
antennas using a 3D design can be prepared with different aspect-ratio:
within the range of a few hundreds of nm high up to a few μm.
We expect that higher antennas (see SI#4) introduce a very high resistivity in the ion flux and, in fact,
it was not possible to obtain a reproducible electrophoretic deposition
at voltages up to 15 V. By decreasing the vertical dimension down
to 1 μm and increasing the diameter of the nanochannel (see Methods for details), it was possible to obtain
the ordered deposition. Actually, by increasing the voltage up to
25 V, a full coverage deposition with high reproducibility was achievable. Figure 2a–c illustrate
some examples of EPD performed onto 3D antennas at different applied
voltages. A drawback related to the high applied voltage used for
EPD onto 3D structures is the deposition of many flakes also around
the 3D antennas. In all of the cases, the deposition results in a
partially covering layer that crinkles around the metal in many ways,
ranging from small flakes covering only the top hole to large flakes
wrapping around the 3D body of the structure. Before discussing how
we evaluated the thickness (in terms of the number of layers) of the
deposited flakes, we want to underline that our EPD method does not
necessarily require a metallic substrate, but can also be applied
to nonconductive substrates patterned with nanoholes. A demonstration
of EPD on a dielectric substrate is reported (see SI#5) where we used a patterned Si3N4 membrane to decorate nanoholes with MoS2 flakes.

A well-known method7,48−51 to measure the thickness, in
terms of the number of layers, of a MoS2 flake is based
on Raman spectroscopy. MoS2 presents two main Raman modes
in the shifts ranging between 360 and 420 cm–1,
i.e., the in-plane (E2g1 at ∼380 cm–1) and out-of-plane (A1g at ∼404
cm–1) modes. The Δf (spectral
distance) between these two modes is known to steadily increase with
the number of layers. A value below 20 cm–1 is typically
associated with a single layer, whereas the values between 20 and
23 cm–1 are associated with bi-layer flakes and
higher values correspond to 3 or more deposited layers. Here, we used
this procedure (already reported in one of our recent papers24) to verify the deposition of MoS2 flakes and to evaluate the number of layers deposited over the different
positions. Raman spectroscopy measurements were performed using a
Renishaw InVia Microscope Raman system with a 50 × 0.95 NA objective,
collecting the signal with a spectral resolution of 2.5 cm–1 and an integration time of 1 s. We used an excitation wavelength
of 532 nm and the intensity of the standard peak at 520 cm–1 from a silicon substrate was used to calibrate the system. The results
of our measurements can be found in Figure 3. Figure 3a,b show the map over large arrays of metallic nanoholes
for low (2 V) and high (15 V) applied voltage, respectively. Figure 3c,d refer to measurements
performed on 3D antennas at 15 and 25 V, respectively. Raman shifts
integrated counts in the range between 400 and 410 cm–1 (in correspondence to the A1g Raman mode) have been used
to evaluate the coverage of the MoS2 over the maps. As
verified by SEM investigations, a significant difference appears amongst
the samples. In all cases, full site-selective deposition over the
nanohole array has been achieved once a potential of 15 and 25 V has
been applied to flat nanoholes and 3D antennas, respectively. For
lower applied voltages, the flakes’ deposition is still verified,
but not all of the arrays are covered. The Raman maps not only demonstrate
the actual site-selective EPD, but they can also be used to perform
statistical analysis of the thickness of the deposited flakes.

Figure 4a,b

statistical analysis of over about 200 and 100 different measured
points of the Raman spectra for the metallic nanoholes and 3D nanoantenna
samples deposited at 2 and 15 V, respectively. As illustrated, the
measured points were fit by Lorentzian functions (Figure 4c). The in-plane (E2g1 at ∼380 cm–1) and out-of-plane
(A1g at ∼404 cm–1) Raman modes
were always clearly visible and used in analysis. The difference between
the E2g1 and A1g modes (Δf) is known to steadily increase with the number of layers;7,48−51 hence, this parameter can be a reliable quantity to count the number
of layers of MoS2. We used Δf to
evaluate the percentage of single, double, or more layers of flakes
deposited on the considered array. We considered “1 layer”
to have a Δf equal to 18 cm–1, “2 layers” when for a value of 22 cm–1 and “more layers” when it is above 23 cm–1.

number of deposited MoS2 layers. (a) Metallic nanoholes

of analyzed spectra.

From our analysis, we can conclude that, while it does not
seem
possible to achieve single layer deposition with the higher applied
potential (15 and 25 V for planar and 3D nanoholes, respectively),
this is possible for a lower applied voltage (2 V for planar nanoholes
and 15 V for 3D antennas). In the case of metallic nanoholes (Figure 4a), a single layer
can be deposited in about 5% of the cases, while the major amount
of the deposited flakes is either double (26%) or more than two layers
(Figure 4b). For the
3D nanoantennas where, due to the high voltage needed for the deposition,
single-layer flakes were only deposited rarely, while the majority
of them resulted in two or more deposited layers. It should be mentioned
that the evaluation of deposited flakes’ thickness can be in
principle performed by means of atomic force microscopy (AFM). This
method, in our case, is less reliable with respect to Raman mapping
not only due to the high time-cost of the measurements but also because
the roughness of our metallic layer is comparable to a single-layer
thickness. As an example, we have reported (see SI#6) an AFM map showing the presence of a single layer.

Finally, statistical analyses based on Raman maps are used to also
give an estimation of the plasmonic field enhancement mentioned previously.
For this approximation, we designed the experimental evaluation as
the following. It is not possible to control the size of the flakes
deposited over the array, but it is well-known that the deposited
flakes play a role in the intensity of the Raman peaks. An evaluation
of the plasmonic field enhancement can therefore be reasonably obtained
with a statistical comparison (over an array of about 200 different
flakes) between the signals from plasmonic and nonplasmonic hole arrays.
We performed similar EPD on both gold and Si3N4 nanoholes and the mean intensities of the out-of-plane A1g peak over the whole array were considered for all of the cases.
The ratio between these values allows us to estimate a plasmonic enhancement
of approximately 5 and 9 for the metallic nanoholes and 3D plasmonic
antennas, respectively (see SI#7).

Computer simulations (see Methods for details)
can be used to better evaluate the observed enhancement effect.34 In particular, we consider the two structures
investigated, i.e., nanoholes and 3D antennas. Figure 5 illustrates the obtained field intensity
confinement/enhancement that can be achieved in the two cases into
the 2D layer. As can be easily seen in the case of a MoS2 flake deposited on top of a 3D antenna (Figure 5b) the electromagnetic field intensity is
more confined and can reach higher values with respect to the case
of a nanohole on a metallic film (Figure 2a). This is also confirmed in our experiments.

Conclusions
In summary, here, we
have presented a proof-of-concept experiment
on a new scheme for the EPD of 2D materials on nanoholes. Our results
demonstrate that whilst it is always possible to achieve a site-selective
deposition of MoS2 flakes and single-layer flakes can be
deposited, the process, in terms of the number of deposited layers,
is hard to control. An overview of the whole deposition procedure
can be surmised as follows. The applied potential creates an electroosmotic
flow from one side of the chamber to the other, and the charged flakes
move along the flow. The nanosized holes on the substrate act as a
filter and the particles are trapped at the locations of the holes
until the holes are completely clogged. Therefore, how many flakes
are deposited depends on their starting shape and size. Moreover,
it also depends on the applied voltage and reasonably from the used
solvents. We reason that better control of the process can be achieved
by altering the EPD conditions and the exfoliation procedure to obtain
better-quality, single-layer flakes in solution. In this work, the
aim was to obtain stable colloids of a few layers of MoS2 without the use of surfactants, which could affect the deposition
process. Therefore, a chemical exfoliation approach was pursued, since
it can provide highly exfoliated nanosheets with negative charges
on the surface.52 However, due to the harshness
of this process, MoS2 flakes can be crashed, causing the
broadening of the size dispersion. Our process was found to be effective
for all of the flakes’ sizes, however, being EPD, a process
influenced by hydrodynamical behavior of the material, a narrower
distribution of lateral size and thickness would allow a sharper control
on the deposition parameters. Hence, we believe that improving the
synthesis procedure could result in an enhancement of the plasmonic
response of these systems as well. Moreover, it is worthwhile to note
that our strategy to obtain MoS2 nanosheets is rather slow,
but the throughput of the Li-based exfoliation can be increased dramatically
by switching from chemical to electrochemical intercalation.53,54 In this regard, the preparation of single-layer MoS2 would
then be quick enough to make feasible the application of these systems
on large scales.

Regardless, we have demonstrated that this
fabrication procedure
can be used to prepare hybrid plasmonic nanostructures over large
arrays. This procedure is low-cost and does not require the use of
complex lithographic processes. This strategy can be applied to many
2D materials for which the net charge of their surface can be used
to guide the electrophoretic process. We believe that such an approach
can find interesting applications in new hybrid devices for photoluminescence,
strong coupling, and valley polarization studies.

Methods
Exfoliation
of MoS2
In a glove-box (water
< 1 ppm, O2 < 10 ppm), LiBH4 (0.109 g,
5 mmol) and MoS2 (0.320 g, 2 mmol) were ground in a mortar
and then transferred to a Schlenk-tube. This was then brought outside
the glove-box and connected to a Schlenk-line. The mixture was then
heated in a sand bath at 330 °C for 4 days under nitrogen. Afterward,
the Schlenk-tube was again returned to dry-box, where it was ground
with additional LiBH4 (0.109 g, 5 mmol). The sample was
subsequently heated for another 3 days at 330 °C under nitrogen.

The intercalation product was added in a single shot in 270 mL
of degassed water and the resulting suspension was bath-sonicated
for 1 h to facilitate the exfoliation.

To remove the LiOH produced,
the suspension was equally divided
into six centrifugation tubes (45 mL/tube) and centrifuged at 10 000
rpm (23 478g) for 20 min for three times,
replacing the supernatant with a clean solvent.

To select the
flake size, the suspension purified by LiOH, was
progressively centrifuged at 8000 (15 026g—8k fraction), 6000 (8452g—6k), 4000
(3757g—4k), 3000 (2113g—3k),
2000 (939g—2k), and 1000 rpm (235g—1k), collecting each time the top 2/3 of the supernatant
and replacing it with ultrapure water.

Fabrication of Plasmonic
Nanostructures
The fabrication
of the metallic nanoholes follows simple and robust procedures for
the 2D and 3D geometry. In both cases, the substrate was a Si3N4 membrane (100 nm thick) prepared on a Silicon
chip. The 2D holes were prepared by means of FIB milling with a voltage
of 30 keV and a current of 80 pA. After milling, a thin layer of gold,
ca. 100 nm, was deposited on the top side of the membrane. The fabrication
of the 3D nanoantennas array follows the procedure laid out in ref (24). A thin layer of S1813
optical resist is spin coated on top of the membrane with a final
thickness equal to the height of the structure we want to obtain.
This layer is exposed by the secondary electron during the FIB milling
of the nanoholes from the bottom of the membrane, afterward the resist
is developed in acetone and a final metal deposition (ca. 40 nm) produces
the 3D hollow antenna array. For these experiments, 3D antennas with
the inner diameter between 30 and 100 nm and final height between
1000 and 2000 nm were prepared.

FEM Simulation of MoS2 Flakes Integrated over Plasmonic
Nanostructures
We investigate the plasmonic properties of
the structure by means of finite element method (FEM) simulations
using an RF module in Comsol Multiphysics taking into account the
geometries that were actually fabricated. For the nanohole array,
we consider a hole of 100 nm in diameter in a 100 nm thick Si3N4 membrane with a 50 nm thick Au layer. In the
case of the 3D antennas, we consider an antenna with a height equal
to 1000 nm and an inner and outer diameter of 100 and 300 nm, respectively.
A top single layer of MoS2 has been considered for both
cases.

The refractive indices of Au and MoS2 were
taken from the works of Rakic et al. and Zhang et al.55,56 The model computes the electromagnetic field distribution in each
point of the simulation region, enabling the extraction of the quantities
plotted in Figure 5. A single nanostructure was considered by setting the unit cell
to be 400 nm wide in both the x- and y-directions, with perfect matching layers (150 nm thick) at the borders.
A linearly polarized incident plane wave was assumed to impinge on
the structure from the air side.

Measurement of Dynamics
Light Scattering of MoS2 Flakes
DLS experiments
were performed using a Malvern Zetasizer nano ZS
and the measurements were evaluated using Zetasizer software. Since
polar solvents have been used in this study, 1.5 was chosen as the
value for f(ka) (Smoluchowski approximation).
Thanks to this approximation, the influence of the size of the material
in suspension is limited, allowing the use of Henry’s equation
(therefore DLS) for the evaluation of electrophoretic mobility of
nonspherical materials.57,58 Data are reported as
the average of three measurements (n = 3) ±
SD. Samples were measured at 25 °C in disposable folded capillary
cells (DTS1070) in water dispersants.
