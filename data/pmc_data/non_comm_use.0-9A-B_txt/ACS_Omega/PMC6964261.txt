Porous coordination polymers have received intensive
attention
for pollution abatement, such as dye removal, because of their high
porosity and specific surface areas. However, the commonly used water-stable
porous coordination polymers are microporous and synthesized within
organic solvents, which deters seriously their widespread application.
In this report, we developed a facile strategy for the synthesis of
mesoporous Zr-based coordination polymer (Zr-BDC-CP) within aqueous
solutions. The morphology and structure of Zr-BDC-CP were characterized
with scanning electron microscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, and Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy. Pore size distribution analysis confirms
that the as-synthesized material is mesoporous, which allows the efficient
adsorption of methylene blue, 2.6 times higher than that of the microporous
coordination polymer, UiO-66. The decolorization ratio can reach higher
than 93.5% in the range of 10 and 400 mg/L for methylene blue solutions.
This Zr-based coordination polymer shows wonderful pH stability, where
no significant loss of adsorption capacities was observed between
pH values of 3 and 11. The simulation of adsorption isotherm indicates
that the Freundlich model can fit the adsorption isotherm very well,
which reflects that the surface of adsorbents is inhomogeneous. Fitting
of kinetic curves shows that the dye adsorption by Zr-BDC-CP follows
the pseudo-second-order model, which confirms that the rate-determining
step may be a chemisorption process involving valence forces because
of the defects within the frameworks of the mesoporous coordination
polymer. Zr-BDC-CP also shows desirable recyclability without significant
capacity loss. This work presents a facile and sustainable method
for the preparation of mesoporous Zr-based coordination polymer for
dye removal with excellent stability and recyclability, which could
further push the porous coordination polymers for application in the
areas of pollution abatement.

==== Body
Introduction
Organic dyes, such as methyl orange, methylene
blue, and rhodamine
B, are widely employed in paper, food, and textile industry.1,2 At the same time, the discharge of dyes leads to serious environmental
problems3 on account of their highly toxic
and non-biodegradable nature.4 Their removal
from waste water has been widely studied by various approaches.5 The conventional methods of dye wastewater treatment
include the chemical method,6 the physical
adsorption method,7 and the biological
method.8,9 Among these methods, adsorption has received
much attention owing to its high efficiency, low operation cost, and
easy regeneration/recycling of adsorbents.10 Therefore, it is of significant importance to design an exceptional
adsorbent with high selectivity and adsorption capacity, fast kinetics,
and good recycling properties.11

Porous coordination polymers (PCPs), or the so-called metal organic
frameworks, one of the exciting class of multifunctional crystalline
porous materials,12,13 are constructed by the mutual
connection between metal clusters and organic linkers.14 PCPs exhibit highly ordered porosity and high
specific surface area,15 which make these
materials suitable for selective removal of dye molecules, organic
isomers, and even fullerenes. In particular, a Zr-based PCP, UIO-66,
has been extensively investigated for pollute removal16 because of its high surface area (>1000 m2/g)
and relatively higher thermal and hydrodynamic stabilities even under
acidic/basic conditions.1 For example,
Yao et al.1 reported that acetic acid-promoted
UiO-66 could selectively adsorb methyl orange and methylene blue.
Liu et al.17 fabricated a hybrid material
through assembling a two-dimensional Tb-based coordination polymer
on UiO-66-NH2, which achieved simultaneous adsorption18 and detection of organic dyes. However, UiO-66
is a typical microporous coordination polymer, with a moderate pore
window size of 0.7 nm, which is almost similar to the size of typical
organic dyes19 (the width of cross-section
of methylene blue is around 0.7 nm). On the other hand, Zr-based coordination
polymers are often synthesized within N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF),20 an expensive
organic solvent. Therefore, it is important and also a challenge to
synthesize mesoporous coordination polymers with high adsorption capacity
under environmental benign conditions.

In this work, we develop
a convenient strategy for the aqueous
synthesis of mesoporous Zr-based coordination polymers (abbreviated
as Zr-BDC-CP) at room temperature. Herein, water is used to replace
the organic solvent, DMF, and NaOH is added to deprotonate the ligand,
which can initiate the reaction to produce precipitates within several
minutes at room temperature. The as-prepared coordination polymer
is mesoporous with an average pore size of 6 nm, which shows an enhanced
adsorption capacity of 9.78 mg/g toward methylene blue at a concentration
of 100 mg/L, around 3 times higher than UiO-66 (3.71 mg/g). The mesoporous
material shows stable adsorption ability at a wide pH range between
3 and 11 and can be recycled without a significant capacity loss.

Results and Discussion
Characterization of Zr-BDC-CP
The morphology of Zr-BDC-CP
was characterized with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) as shown
in Figure 1a, which
shows that the as-prepared sample is an aggregate of nanoparticles.
The structure of the coordination polymer was characterized with powder
X-ray diffraction (PXRD) (Figure S2), however,
the PXRD pattern is indicative of the nature of amorphous material.
The formation coordination polymer was confirmed with Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy (Figure 1b), where a peak at 1678 cm–1 attributed
to H2BDC disappeared, and a peak at 1556 cm–1 becomes the main peak for Zr-BDC-CP.21 Zr-BDC-CP also exhibits excellent thermal stability, which is stable
up to 450 °C under an Ar atmosphere (Figure S1).

Figure 1 (a) SEM image of Zr-BDC-CP and (b) FTIR spectra of Zr-BDC-CP and
H2BDC.

The porosity of Zr-BDC-CP was analyzed by N2 adsorption/desorption
isotherms. As shown in Figure 2a, Zr-BDC-CP shows a typical type IV isotherm with an H3 hysteresis
loop, which is the characteristic of mesoporous materials because
of the gap resulting from nanoparticle aggregation. This indicates
that the formation of mesopores within Zr-BDC-CP results from the
aggregation of nanoparticles, which is consistent with the observation
in SEM images. Further pore size distribution analysis confirms that
the mesoporous coordination polymer is formed with an average pore
diameter of 6.4 nm. The specific surface area and pore volume are
157 m2/g and 0.51 cm3/g, respectively.

Dye Adsorption Performance of Zr-BDC-CP
Methylene blue
is a typical dye, which is widely applied in the area of chemical
indicators, printing and dyeing, and pharmacy; therefore, this dye
was selected as a model to assess the dye adsorption performance of
as-prepared samples. Adsorption isotherms of Zr-BDC-CP toward methylene
blue aqueous solutions with different concentrations (20, 40, 60,
80, 100, 150, 200, and 400 mg/L) were first measured to assess the
adsorption capacity and kinetics, as shown in Figure 3a. It is found that Zr-BDC-CP can arrive
at the saturated adsorption capacity within 5 h. We observe that the
saturated adsorption capacity is linear with the initial concentration
of the dye, and the maximum adsorption capacity is 38.17 mg/g in the
tested range. We also compare the adsorption performance with that
of typical microporous UiO-66 at the initial dye concentration of
100 mg/L. More interestingly, the saturated adsorption capacity of
Zr-BDC-CP is 9.78 mg/g, which is 2.6 times higher than that of UiO-66
(3.71 mg/g). The significant improvement can be attributed to the
presence of mesopores in Zr-BDC-CP, whereas surface adsorption occurs
mainly for UiO-66 because of the nature of microporous materials.
The enhanced adsorption efficiency of Zr-BDC-CP other than UiO-66
can be directly observed from the photos of the dye solutions after
the adsorption saturation (Figure S4).
The color of dye solution after adsorption with Zr-BDC-CP is very
shallow, whereas that for UiO-66 is still very deep, which can obviously
confirm that Zr-BDC-CP shows excellent dye removal ability. The decolorization
ratio of Zr-BDC-CP was also calculated, as shown in Figure 3d. The decolorization efficiency
is quite high, and the decolorization ratio can reach 98.4% at a low
concentration (20 mg/L) and 93.5% at an even higher concentration
(400 mg/L).

concentration on the adsorption capacity of methylene blue by Zr-BDC-CP;
and (d) effect of initial concentration on the decolorization ratio
of Zr-BDC-CP for removal of methylene blue.

The adsorption capacity of adsorbents with different
pH values
is also an important parameter, which determines their application
range. Hence, we also measured the adsorption performance of Zr-BDC-CP
in dye solutions with different pH values, including 1, 3, 5, 7, 9,
11, and 14. Figure 4 shows that Zr-BDC-CP possesses the highest adsorption capacity at
a pH value of 7, and no significant capacity loss was observed between
3 and 11 for Zr-BDC-CP. However, the capacity decreases sharply when
the pH was decreased to 1, which is possibly because of the structure
collapse under highly acidic conditions. The photo of dye solutions
after adsorption at different pH values clearly confirms the above-mentioned
conclusion. These results indicate that the as-prepared mesoporous
coordination polymer displays desirable adsorption capacity at the
relatively wide pH range, which can enhance the practical application
of this material.

(inset is the photo of dye solutions after adsorption at different
pH values).

Adsorption Isotherm of Zr-BDC-CP for Dye Removal
The
adsorption mechanism of Zr-BDC-CP was disclosed through the analysis
of the adsorption isotherm for methylene blue removal. Two commonly
used models were employed to simulate the adsorption isotherms of
Zr-BDC-CP: Langmuir and Freundlich models. The fitting curves according
to Langmuir and Freundlich models are shown in Figure 5 and the fitting parameters are tabulated
in Table 1. The fitting
curves and correlation coefficients (R2) reveal that the Freundlich model is more appropriate for fitting
the adsorption isotherm. This result is different from that of the
microporous coordination polymer, such as UiO-66 and UiO-67.22,23 In the case of microporous coordination polymers, the pore is highly
ordered, homogenous, and mostly in the range of 0.5–1 nm, merely
allowing the monolayer adsorption of dyes within the pores, so that
the adsorption isotherm can be fitted with the Langmuir model. However,
in our case, the as-prepared material is mesoporous, and the pore
surface is not homogenous like the microporous coordination polymers,
where multilayer adsorption is possible so that the Langmuir model
is not suitable for fitting the adsorption. The fitting parameters
(KF and n) from the Freundlich
model reflect the interaction between the adsorbates and adsorbents. KF is related to the adsorption capacity of the
adsorbent and represents the strength of the adsorptive bond, and
the value of n reflects the bond distribution adsorption and the type
of isotherm to be favorable (n > 1) or unfavorable
(0 < n < 1). Compared with UiO-67 reported
previously, Zr-BDC-CP shows higher adsorption capacity and favorable
adsorption.23

Adsorption Kinetics of Zr-BDC-CP
To understand the
adsorption kinetics of Zr-BDC-CP for removal of methylene blue, we
fitted the relationship between the adsorption capacity and adsorption
time according to two typical models: pseudo-first-order model and
pseudo-second-order model (Figure 6a). The kinetic parameters and correlation coefficients
of Zr-BDC-CP for dye adsorption are listed in Table 2. The fitting curves, kinetic parameters,
and correlation coefficients confirm that adsorption of methylene
blue by Zr-BDC-CP follows the pseudo-second-order model. The equilibrium
adsorption amount calculated from the pseudo-second-order kinetics
matches very well with the experimental data (38.17 mg/g). The pseudo-second-order
kinetics was developed assuming that the rate-determining step may
be a chemisorption process involving valence forces via exchanging
or sharing electrons between the adsorbates and adsorbents. Zr-BDC-CP
was synthesized rapidly in an aqueous solution, possibly producing
more defects in the frameworks, which could improve the interaction
between methylene blue and Zr-BDC-CP.

Recyclability of Zr-BDC-CP for Removal of Methylene Blue
Recyclability is one of the important parameters for judging the
adsorption performance of an adsorbent; therefore, we also tested
the recyclability of Zr-BDC-CP. After adsorption of methylene blue,
Zr-BDC-CP was regenerated through washing with sodium hydroxide aqueous
solution and ethanol for several times, and then the regenerated sample
was applied for adsorption of methylene blue again. The dye removal
efficiency of Zr-BDC-CP versus recycling times is shown in Figure 7. It is found that
the dye removal efficiency showed no obvious decrease for first three
times, and only a slight decrease was observed after recycling for
six times (from 93.5% at the first time to 90.0% at the sixth time).
The slight decrease possibly resulted from the mass loss during the
washing step. The results clearly demonstrate that Zr-BDC-CP can be
easily recycled for the removal of methylene blue, which is definitely
beneficial to its practical application.

Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully developed
an aqueous synthesis
of mesoporous Zr-based coordination polymers for removal of methylene
blue. The synthetic strategy is straightforward and sustainable without
use of organic solvents. The as-prepared coordination polymer exhibits
an average diameter of 6.4 nm, which allows the efficient adsorption
of dyes, 2.6 times higher than that of microporous UiO-66. The decolorization
ratio can reach higher than 93.5% in the range of 10 and 400 mg/L
for methylene blue solutions. The adsorption experiments in dye solutions
with different pH values demonstrate that the mesoporous Zr-based
coordination polymers can be utilized for dye removal between pH values
of 3 and 11 without significant loss. The simulation of isotherms
indicates that the Freundlich model can fit the adsorption isotherm
very well, which reflects that the surface of adsorbents is not homogeneous.
Fitting of kinetic curves shows that the dye adsorption by Zr-BDC-CP
follows the pseudo-second-order model, which confirms that the rate-determining
step may be a chemisorption process involving valence forces because
of the defects within the frameworks of mesoporous coordination polymers.
Zr-BDC-CP also shows desirable recyclability without a significant
capacity loss after washing the materials saturated with methylene
blue with the alkaline solution and ethanol. This work presents a
facile and sustainable method for the preparation of mesoporous Zr-based
coordination polymers for dye removal with excellent stability and
recyclability, which could further push the PCPs for application in
the areas of pollution abatement.

Experimental Section
Reagents and Chemicals
Zirconium tetrachloride (ZrCl4), terephthalic acid (H2BDC), methylene blue (C16H18ClN3S), sodium hydroxide (NaOH),
trimethylamine (C6H15N), acetone (C3H6O), and DMF (C3H7NO) were of analytical
reagent grade, commercial, and used without further purification.

Preparation of Mesoporous Zr-Based Coordination Polymer (Zr-BDC-CP)
Mesoporous Zr-based coordination polymer was synthesized as follows:
0.16 g of ZrCl4, 0.114 g of terephthalic acid (H2BDC), and 0.055 g of NaOH were dissolved in 10 mL of deionized water.
Two solutions were mixed together under stirring for 24 h under room
temperature. After the reaction, the products were washed repeatedly
with trimethylamine aqueous solution and ethanol three times and then
dried at 60 °C overnight in a vacuum drying oven. Typically,
UiO-66 was synthesized according to the literature.16

Characterization
The phase identification and crystallinity
of the samples were performed on a powder X-ray diffractometer (D8
ADVANCE) using Cu Kα radiation, where the scanning range of
the diffraction angle (2θ) was 5–40°. The scanning
rate was 4° min–1, and the step width was 0.02°
with 40 mA operation current and 40 kV voltage. Thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) was performed using a HTG-1 (HENVEN) instrument, and
the sample was heated from room temperature to 800 °C at a rate
of 10 °C min–1 under an Ar atmosphere. SEM
measurements were made on a Hitachi S-4800 thermal field emission
scanning electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 5, 10,
or 15 kV. Samples for SEM measurements were attached to the stub using
the carbon paste and then sputter-coated with a thin layer of conductive
gold to improve electrical conductivity. The nitrogen adsorption–desorption
isotherms were measured at 77 K with a JW-BK200C (Beijing JWGB Sci.
& Tech. Co., Ltd.) gas adsorption analyzer after the sample was
first degassed at 120 °C overnight. Specific surface areas were
determined by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method, mesopore
size distribution was obtained based on the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
analysis of the desorption branches of the isotherms, and the total
pore volumes were determined using the desorption branch of the N2 isotherm at p/p0 = 0.99 (single point). FTIR spectra were measured by compressing
the samples into KBr pellets and recording FTIR spectra in the 250–4000
cm–1 range using a Bruker TENSOR 27 FTIR spectrometer.
Ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectra were recorded on
an Agilent Cary 300 spectrophotometer.

Adsorption Experiments
Methylene blue was used as a
probe dye at different concentrations to evaluate the adsorption capacity
of the as-prepared samples. Typically, 50 mg of Zr-BDC-CP was added
into 5 mL of 100 mg/L dye solution at 25 °C in a constant temperature
shaker. The adsorption capacities were calculated by monitoring the
intensity of the supernatant liquid with an UV–vis spectrophotometer
at given intervals. (The supernatant liquid was obtained by filtration
with a 0.22 μm filter.) The adsorption capacity of UiO-66 was
measured by the same method as that for Zr-BDC-CP.

Regeneration of Zr-BDC-CP after Dye Removal
After adsorption
of methylene blue, Zr-BDC-CP was regenerated through washing with
0.4 mol/L of sodium hydroxide aqueous solution and ethanol for three
times separately, until the color of mesoporous materials turned white,
which were then dried at 60 °C overnight in a vacuum oven. The
concentration of the dye solution used to measure the recyclability
is 400 mg/L, and the adsorption time is 10 h.

Adsorption Isotherms of Zr-BDC-CP
The mass concentration,
adsorption capacity, and decolorization rate of methylene blue solution
were determined by the UV–vis spectrophotometer. The data obtained
were calculated according to the following formula    wherein C0 is
the initial mass concentration of methylene blue solution (mg/L); Ce is the mass concentration (mg/L) of methylene
blue24 solution after equilibrium; qe is the equilibrium adsorption capacity (mg/g); m is the mass of the adsorbent used (g); V is the volume of waste water (L); and η is the decolorization
rate of methylene blue solution (%).

Adsorption isotherm refers
to the curve of the relationship between the mass concentration of
the dye and the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent after adsorption
reaches equilibrium,25,26 which can reflect the interaction
between the adsorbents and adsorbates.27 The typical models used to simulate adsorption isotherms of solid–liquid
adsorption include Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption models.28 It should be noted that the Langmuir model is
a theoretical, monolayer adsorption one, whereas the Freundlich model
is empirical. Langmuir model is based on the assumption that the adsorption
is monolayer adsorption on the surface of adsorbents and adsorption
locations are evenly distributed on the solid surface. The Freundlich
adsorption model is often used to describe heterogeneous adsorption
systems. The linear fitting equations based on these two models are
shown as follows:

Linear Langmuir equation  

Linear Freundlich equation  wherein qe is
the equilibrium adsorption capacity (mg/g), qmax is the maximum adsorption capacity (mg/g), Ce is the equilibrium concentration (mg/L), KL is a constant related to adsorption energy, Kf is the Freundlich coefficient, and n is the Freundlich constant.

Adsorption Kinetics of Zr-BDC-CP
The main reason for
studying adsorption kinetics is to investigate the quality of minimum
adsorbents required for complete removal in a certain period, which
is also an important factor to assess the adsorbent performance.29 The kinetic equation can directly reflect the
relationship between the adsorption capacity and time during an adsorption
process, and it can well explain the reaction mechanism and reaction
path, as well as reliably predicting the adsorption result and process
according to the adsorption kinetic model, which provides valuable
insights into the treatment of organic dyes.30 There are two commonly used adsorption kinetic models, namely the
pseudo-first-order and the pseudo-second- order kinetic models. The
difference is whether the limiting factor of adsorption is mass-transfer
resistance or not. The pseudo-first-order kinetic model considers
that the limiting factor of adsorption is the mass-transfer resistance
from the interior of the adsorbents. However, the pseudo-second-order
kinetic model considers that the limiting factor of adsorption is
actually the adsorption mechanism instead of the mass-transfer resistance.

Pseudo-first-order kinetic equation  

Pseudo-second order kinetic equation  K1 is the rate
constant of the first-order kinetic model (min–1), K2 is the rate constant of the second-order
kinetic model (g/(mg·min)), q is the adsorption
capacity of adsorbents at a certain time (mg/g), qe is the equilibrium adsorption capacity (mg/g), and t is the adsorption time (min).
