Intermolecular interactions between
alkyl chains such as CH···HC
should be reflected in the phase behavior of organic compounds. We
measured the attenuated total reflectance spectra in the far-UV region
(145–300 nm) of n-tetradecane (Tm = 5.9 °C), through both cooling and heating, from
15 to −38 °C, to determine its temperature dependency.
The chosen temperature range, with the minimum temperature much lower
than the melting point of n-tetradecane, allowed
for a detailed examination of the liquid–solid phase transition.
With decreasing temperature, the absorption band at 153 nm in the
liquid phase becomes weaker, and new bands appear at around 200 and
230 nm. Because the observed variations in the band intensities are
reversible during both cooling and heating processes and the conversion
from the 153 nm band to 200 and 230 nm bands takes place at the melting
temperature, we concluded that these spectral changes are caused by
changes in the electronic states because of the phase change. To understand
the origin of this drastic change observed experimentally, we carried
out time-dependent density functional theory calculations using a
model dimer structure of n-pentane and periodic density
functional theory calculations of the polyethylene crystal structure.
Although the simulated absorption spectra of both the optimized and
crystal structures did not explain the changes observed experimentally
in the absorption spectra, compressed structures were found to be
a potential explanation for the experimental findings. These results
suggest that an unusually compressed structure might be generated
on the surface at low temperatures, and this phase change, which is
reversible, is responsible for the unusual absorption observed in
the attenuated total reflection–far ultraviolet spectra.

Introduction
Understanding intermolecular
interactions is an area of ongoing
scientific research, and intermolecular interactions that involve
hydrogen atoms with the same polarity, the so-called dihydrogen contacts,
such as CH···HC, are of significant interest and have
been the subject of many theoretical studies.1 The interactions between alkanes in a crystal are of fundamental
importance to the understanding of this interaction. Previously, many
basic studies on the crystallization of n-alkanes
were performed, with reports on liquid–solid and solid–solid
phase transition temperatures.2 These studies
suggested that n-alkanes show some unique phenomena
during phase transition processes, such as surface freezing3 and rotator phases,4 and these phase behaviors show different trends between even and
odd number of carbon atoms.5 Studies of n-alkanes crystallized within oil-in-water emulsion droplets
have demonstrated that it is possible to achieve new polymorphic crystalline
structures in a soft microencapsulated environment.6 Recently, Xie et al. have reported the crystallization
of n-alkanes in a confined space, which has a very
large surface area, to control the crystalline structure.7 Although investigations on the electronic states
of n-alkanes in the solid phase have been carried
out to some extent, changes in their electronic states before and
after a phase transition are still not well understood.

n-Alkanes (CnH2n+2) are relatively unreactive molecules
composed only of saturated C–C and C–H bonds. The bands
attributed to the first electronic transition of n-alkanes (n = 1–8) in the gas phase were
observed in the 110–145 nm region via transmittance far ultraviolet
(TR-FUV) absorption spectroscopy.8 Because
the allowed electronic transitions of neat organic solids have large
absorption coefficients (α = 105 cm–1), the effective path length for a successful absorption spectra
measurement must be shorter than 100 nm. For this reason, TR-FUV spectra
of organic solids can be measured only for thin films. A few absorption
spectra of long chain alkanes (n = 36, 42, 44)9 and a polyethylene film9 have been measured in the region of 100–200 nm based on thin
film experiments. However, because of the poor reproducibility of
thin film experiments, definitive absorption bands of solid alkanes
remain elusive.

Higashi et al. found that it is possible to
measure attenuated
total reflection (ATR) spectra in the FUV region by using an internal
reflection element (IRE) made of sapphire.10 During the ATR measurement, an interaction of the evanescent wave
at the IRE-sample interface, after penetrating by half a wavelength,
allows for the measurement of spectra in the FUV region, with absorbance
as high as α = 106 cm–1. Moreover,
one can obtain an FUV spectrum easily by putting a sample in the air
because the IRE allows sealing an FUV optical path that needs an atmosphere
without oxygen. Thus far, we have reported ATR-FUV spectra of various
pure liquids such as water,11 aqueous solutions,12 alkanes,13 alcohols,14 ketones,15 amides,16 and ionic liquids,17 and solids such as nylons.18 We have
demonstrated that it is possible to probe the conditions of a molecule’s
valence electrons affected by intermolecular interactions in the condensed
phase, by comparing the experimental results with the theoretical
simulation based on quantum chemical calculations.

In this study,
we found that the electronic state of n-tetradecane
is altered drastically in the low-temperature solid
state and that the highest occupied molecular orbital–lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO–LUMO) gap in the aforementioned
state is decreased to 230 nm, which corresponds to the deep-UV (DUV)
region. Thus, we investigate the drastic change in the excited-state
character in n-alkanes at low temperatures because
of phase transition using FUV spectroscopy and time-dependent density
functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations.

Results and Discussion
In the present study, we measured the ATR-FUV spectra of n-tetradecane, through both cooling and heating, from 15
to −38 °C to determine its temperature dependence. The
minimum temperature was much lower than the melting point of n-tetradecane (Tm = 5.9 °C). Figure 1a shows the ATR-FUV
spectra of n-tetradecane measured on cooling from
15 to −38 °C. Similar results were obtained during the
heating process, as shown in Figure 1b.

Figure 1 Temperature-dependent spectral variations in the 145–300
nm region of n-tetradecane, measured over temperature
ranging (a) from 18 to −36 °C on cooling and (b) from
−38 to 15 °C on heating. Insets show their enlargements
in the region of 250–270 nm.

The spectra change little in the temperature range between
6 and
18 °C. However, below the melting point of n-tetradecane, marked temperature-dependent spectral changes are observed.
With decreasing temperature, the absorption band at 153 nm in the
liquid phase becomes weaker and new bands appear at around 200 and
230 nm. The new bands become increasingly weaker as the temperature
is increased (being faintly visible at 5 °C), along with a significant
blue shift. There is a weak-broad feature in the region of 260–280
nm at temperatures below −10 °C. We will discuss about
it in the theoretical section. Additionally, a different shoulder
band demonstrating interesting behavior is seen in the region of 170–180
nm. This shoulder band increases with heating up to 0 °C, before
visibly decreasing. Second-derivative coefficients of the spectra
were used to evaluate the band intensity change of each component,
as shown in Figure 2. A second-derivative peak for the shoulder at around 170–180
nm could not be found. We then plotted the second-derivative coefficient
values for the 153, 200, and 230 nm bands against temperature (Figure 3), where the values
of the vertical axis in Figure 3 were normalized by the minimum value of each band. Temperature-dependent
changes are similar to those shown during both the heating and cooling
process.
The intensity of the 230 nm band steadily decreases as the temperature
is increased from −20 °C to the stipulated melting temperature.
In comparison, the intensity of the 200 nm band increases as the temperature
is increased from −38 to 10 °C, before it weakens considerably
with further heating. The change in the intensity of the 170–180
nm shoulder band may be affected by the increasing intensity of the
200 nm band.

and (b) 180–260 nm regions of n-tetradecane,

Figure 3 Temperature-dependent changes of normalized
second-derivative coefficients
of peaks at 153, 200, and 230 nm during the (a) cooling and (b) heating
process of n-tetradecane.

Because the observed variations in the band intensities are
reversible
during cooling and heating and because an alternation between the
153 nm band and the two longer-wavelength bands takes place at the
melting temperature, we concluded that these spectral changes are
caused by changes in the electronic state of the alkane, owing to
the phase change. For n-alkanes (n = 6 and 8,19 18,20 20 and 24,21 24–28,22 and 3623) with an
even number of carbon atoms, polymorphism has been previously reported.24 Although an orthorhombic phase as a transient
metastable phase has been reported for C16H34, no such observation could be seen for n-tetradecane,
except for a triclinic phase. Even though surface freezing has been
observed for n-alkanes (n = 16–50)
at temperatures several degrees higher than their melting points,
it has not been reported for n-tetradecane. Therefore,
it is very likely that the observed temperature-dependent spectral
variations of n-tetradecane are due to a phase transition
from the liquid phase to the triclinic state.

In our previous
study, a band associated with the first electronic
transition of liquid n-alkanes (CnH2n+2; n = 5–9)
was observed at around 153 nm. Simulation spectra performed at the
level of TD-CAM-B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ and SAC-CI/aug-cc-pVTZ showed slightly
higher excitation energies (around 139 and 142 nm, respectively) than
those found experimentally. Comparing the spectra obtained experimentally
with those predicted using quantum chemical calculations, this band
was attributed to two distinct transitions from two different σ
orbitals near the HOMO to the Ryd 3p orbital.25 Chergui
and co-workers studied molecular Rydberg states in the condensed phase,
especially in the case of molecules in rare gas liquids and solids.99 In a rare gas matrix, low-n Rydberg states show a blue shift, which increases with density.
They also studied molecular Rydberg states in solid H2.100 In the case of NO in solid H2, the
gas-to-matrix shifts of Rydberg transitions reduced from those in
Ne, Ar, and Kr matrices, although the distance between the neighbor
molecules in solid H2 is smaller than those in the case
of Ar and Kr. Even though they discussed about a significant reduction
in the ionization energy due to the electron affinity of the solid
H2, Rydberg states in a molecular solid have been still
unclear. To elucidate the origin of the bands observed in the longer-wavelength
region of the low-temperature spectra of solid n-alkanes,
we carried out quantum chemical calculations for n-alkane dimers as a model of solid n-alkanes. Tsuzuki
et al. reported the optimized structures of several types of n-alkane dimers.1 They showed
that the antiparallel dimers (dimer type E in ref (1d)) of n-butane, n-pentane, and n-hexane
have shorter intermolecular distances at the potential minima than
the other configurations investigated. As a result, the intermolecular
distance in the n-hexane dimer is 3.8 Å. Figure 4 shows the simulated
spectra of the n-pentane monomer, optimized at the
level of MP2/6-311++G**, and that of the antiparallel dimer, the structure
of which was published in the supporting information of ref (1d). The calculations for
electronic excitation were performed at the level of TD-CAM-B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ.
The shoulder band in the spectrum of the dimer is red-shifted by approximately
6 nm relative to that of the monomer. Furthermore, the first electronic
excitation state shows a reduction in energy for the antiparallel
dimer of n-pentane, relative to that of the monomer.
However, the shift is much smaller than that observed in the low-temperature
spectra of solid n-alkanes.

spectra of the n-pentane
monomer optimized by MP2/6-311++G** and that of the previously published
antiparallel dimer.1d

To examine the intermolecular delocalized electronic structure,
we carried out periodic DFT calculations for the crystal structure
of polyethylene, which is considered to be a possible model for long-chain n-alkanes in the solid-state. The computational details
of the crystal structure are explained in the Computational
Methods of Periodic DFT Calculations. Figure 5 compares the calculated
total density of states (TDOS) of the crystal structure with that
of the monomer of polyethylene. The TDOS of the valence band near
the Fermi level of the crystal structure did not show any significant
change relative to that of the monomer. Likewise, the TDOS of the
conduction band of the crystal structure and the monomer are similar
to each other. Using the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE)
hybrid functional produced similar trends in TDOS, as shown in Figure S2. These results suggest that the dramatic
shift observed at low temperatures using ATR-FUV spectroscopy cannot
be explained by a delocalized electronic state of the crystal structure.

the crystal structure (a) and the monomer (b) of polyethylene
using the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional.

Because we could not obtain a suitable theoretical
explanation
for the experimental observations using the conventional structures
discussed thus far, we explored alternatives that could be responsible
for the unusual absorption in the low-energy region.

To this
end, we examined the compressed structures that might occur
because of the phase transition on the surface. As before, the electronic
excited states were calculated for all trans-n-pentane dimers, with an intermolecular distance of 3–6
Å. Figure 6 shows
the simulated spectra of an n-pentane dimer with
the variation in intermolecular distance (r) from
3 to 6 Å, as obtained from the calculations performed at the
level of TD-CAM-B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ. These calculations are detailed
in the Experimental and Theoretical Methods section. The spectrum of the dimer with r = 6 Å
displays a band centered at around 141 nm, which is assigned to the
transition from the σ to Ryd 3p orbital. It can be seen in Figure 6 that the intensity
of this band weakens as the intermolecular distance is decreased from
6 to 3 Å. It can be noted that the spectrum of the dimer with r = 3 Å shows three bands at lower energy, that is,
below 141 nm. This variation in the simulated spectra is in good agreement
with that observed in the ATR-FUV spectra. In Figure 7, the spectral bands of the dimer with r = 3 Å have been assigned to various electronic transitions.
The transition from the σ to Ryd 3p orbital is observed at around
170 nm, which is a red shift of 29 nm, relative to the dimer with r = 6 Å. A weak-broad feature observed in the region
of 260–280 nm has been calculated in the region of 190–200
nm and assigned to the σ to Ryd 3s orbital.
Although the computational model overestimates the absolute excitation
energies, the energy shift and the shape of the absorption bands are
in good agreement with the experimentally observed results.

in the region of 120–220 nm, of an n-pentane
dimer with an intermolecular distance (r) of 3–6
Å, calculated at the level of TD-CAM-B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ.
The inset shows the enlargement in the region of 180–210 nm.

an intermolecular distance (r) of 3 Å, along
with band assignments, calculated at the level of TD-CAM-B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ.

Figure 8 plots the
orbital energies of the HOMO and Ryd 3px orbitals, which is instructive in understanding the spectral changes
observed with varying intermolecular distances. Decreasing the intermolecular
distance leads to a concomitant increase in the energy of HOMO, whereas
the energy of the Ryd 3px orbital does
not change appreciably. Thus, only electrons of the occupied orbital,
that is, σ electrons are affected by the intermolecular distance.

Figure 8 Calculated
results for the orbital energy of the HOMO and Ryd 3px orbitals at r = 3–6
Å.

Figure 9 displays
the calculated molecular orbitals (MO) of a single n-pentane molecule [(a), (b)] and its dimer [(c), (d)]. MO of the
HOMO of dimers with the intermolecular distance longer than 5 Å
are almost the same as those of the HOMO of the single molecule. Because,
in the intermolecular distance of the dimer between 5 and 6 Å,
the orbital energies of HOMO – 1 and HOMO – 2 increase
with the decrease in the intermolecular distance more steeply than
that of the HOMO, the orbital energy of the dimer interchanges at
the intermolecular distance of 4 Å. As a result, HOMO –
1 and HOMO – 2 of the single molecule become HOMO and HOMO
– 1, respectively, in the dimer with an intermolecular distance
of less than 4 Å. The HOMO – 1 and HOMO – 2 of
the single molecule are strongly destabilized by decreasing the r value, with these orbitals correlating with the HOMO (Figure 9c) and HOMO –
1 (Figure 9d) respectively,
of the dimer with r < 4 Å. As seen in Figure 9c,d, the HOMO and
HOMO – 1 of the dimer have an antiphase interaction, which
leads to a repulsive interaction between the two molecules. Therefore,
these two orbitals, associated with transitions assigned to bands
in the low-energy region of the calculated absorbance spectra, are
significantly destabilized. The difference in the energy of the HOMO
when varying the intermolecular distance of the dimer from 3 to 6
Å is 1.4 eV, which is reflected in the energy of the HOMO–Ryd
3p transition (141–165 nm; 1.3 eV).

(a) HOMO – 1 and (b) HOMO – 2 and those of its dimer
(r < 4 Å) (c) HOMO, and (d) HOMO –
1.

We also performed periodic DFT
calculations for the compressed
crystal structure of polyethylene. Figure 10 shows the TDOS of polyethylene with compressed
crystal parameters with a factor of 0.8 and 0.7; that is, the lattice
parameters are scaled by a factor of 0.8 and 0.7. These compressed
crystal structures are shown in Figures S4 and S5. Although the calculations using a factor of 0.8 gave a
TDOS similar to that of the noncompressed structure (Figure 5a), the band gap calculated
using a factor of 0.7 is much narrower. This means that the electronic
transition within the structure shows a significant red shift upon
compression. In principle, these results correlate with the aforementioned
dimer model calculations and explain the absorption band in the low-energy
region.

Figure 10 TDOS of a polyethylene crystal with a compression factor of (a)
0.8 and (b) 0.7.

As described above,
we could not reproduce the spectral variation
in the longer-wavelength region, observed experimentally in the low-temperature
range, with a known crystal structure or a structure-optimized dimer
model. However, we could reproduce the experimental result with a
dimer model that is more compressed than the stable models, with an
intermolecular distance of 3 Å. Therefore, it is very likely
that the experimental result obtained at low temperatures demonstrates
changes in the electronic structure of the alkane because of the local
compression caused by some sort of force.

As shown in Figure 3, the intensity of
the normalized second-derivative coefficient of
the band at 153 nm decreases to below 20% in the liquid state. Our
calculations suggest that if the alkane becomes solid without compression,
the band gap does not decrease and an electronic spectrum close to
its liquid spectrum should be observed. Thus, if we assume a structure
that is compressed locally and has a decreased band gap, it would
occupy 80% of the observed range.

The penetration depth in the
ATR spectroscopy can be estimated
from the following equation 1  where n1 and n2 are the refractive
indices of the IRE and
the sample, respectively; in the case of the sapphire used for the
IRE, it is 2.0 at 153 nm. The refractive index of n-tetradecane is reported to be nd ∼1.43,
but in the solid state, where its density increases, the refractive
index becomes ∼1.53, which is close to that of polyethylene;
λ is the wavelength of light, which is 150 nm; and θ is
the incident angle, which is 70°. By using this incident angle,
the penetration depth dp is calculated
to be 20 and 22 nm at n2 = 1.43 and 1.53,
respectively. This suggests that a structure with a decreased band
gap is formed at least 16 nm below the surface.

Conclusions
In
the present study, the temperature-dependent ATR-FUV spectra
of n-tetradecane and the calculated spectra of n-pentane dimers with various intermolecular distances have
provided the following new insight: valence molecular orbitals (even
σ orbitals) interact with their neighbors in the condensed phase,
whereas the unoccupied Ryd orbitals are unaffected. A repulsive interaction
appears in the FUV spectra. The ATR-FUV spectra of the low-temperature
solid n-alkane indicate that the energy of its HOMO
and the energy gap between its HOMO and LUMO in the solid phase are
reduced to approximately 60% of those in the liquid phase. It is still
unclear whether this observation of such a remarkable reduction in
the excitation energy is characteristic of a surface or an aluminum
interface.

Experimental and Theoretical Methods
Materials
n-Tetradecane (99%) was
purchased from Nacalai Tesque Inc., Kyoto, Japan, and used without
further purification.

Temperature-Dependence Measurement of ATR
Spectra in the FUV
Region
Details of the ATR-FUV spectrometer used in this study
have been reported elsewhere.1 Briefly,
it consists of an FUV monochromator (KV-200, Bunkoh-Keiki, Japan)
and an external sample compartment. To prevent the absorption of oxygen,
the sealed inner compartments were separately purged with nitrogen
gas (99.999%). The light source used was a 30 W deuterium lamp. The
FUV radiation from the monochromator was split into a reference beam
and sample beam using an MgF2 splitter. The sample beam
was passed through an ATR probe equipped with a small hemicylindrical
prism IRE made of vacuum-UV-grade sapphire, with an incident angle
of 70°. Finally, the reflected light and the reference beam are
passed through a synthetic quartz plate coated with sodium salicylic
acid, which fluoresces. The fluorescence of each beam was then detected
using a photomultiplier, which converts the fluorescence into an electronic
signal.

We first measured the reflection spectrum through a
prism to determine the background intensity, I0, at room temperature. Following this, we placed a liquid
sample on the prism and measured its ATR intensity, I. We continued to measure the ATR intensity as the sample was cooled
and then warmed back up. The ATR absorption, A, is
defined by the following formula 2  In the temperature-dependence
measurement, n-tetradecane was introduced into an
ATR probe as a liquid
at room temperature. Next, the sample was cooled from 20 to −38
°C over 27 min while being kept in the probe. During the cooling
process, the ATR-FUV spectra were recorded every 3 min to give nine
distinct temperature points. After the cooling process was stopped,
the temperature was increased to 15 °C over 105 min, and the
spectra were recorded at 35 temperature points. Figure 11 shows the cooling and heating
rates, along with the observed temperatures of the experiments.

conditions for the temperature-dependent FUV spectroscopy
experiment in the 145–300 nm region of n-tetradecane,

Computational Methods for
the Dimer Model
TD-DFT calculations
were carried out for the model system. The B3LYP26 and CAM-B3LYP27 functionals
were used for the ground and excited states, respectively. The ground-state
geometry of the monomer pentane was obtained by optimization at the
B3LYP/cc-pVTZ28 level of theory, followed
by a vibrational analysis to confirm that the calculated structure
is a true local minimum. To construct the dimer models of n-pentane with intermolecular distances of 3–6 Å,
we place two n-pentane molecules parallel to the
molecular axis. For calculating the vertical transition energies of
these model systems, the TD-CAM-B3LYP calculations were carried out
with aug-cc-pVTZ.29 All calculations were
performed using the Gaussian 09 Rev. B.01 suite of program.30 Spectral simulations were conducted with the
Gauss function convolution with a half width at half height value
of 0.2 eV using GaussView.31

Computational
Methods of Periodic DFT Calculations
To obtain the density
of states (DOS) of the crystal structure and
the single chain of polyethylene, periodic DFT calculations were performed
by using the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP).32 The crystal structure was modeled as a unit
cell with experimental parameters of 7.39 × 4.93 × 2.54
Å3,33 as shown in Figure S1a. In the case of the single chain,
a large unit cell (14.78 × 9.86 × 2.54 Å3) was used to avoid the interaction between the single chain and
its repeated motif (Figure S1b). The lattice
parameters were fixed, while all atoms were allowed to relax in the
optimization calculations. The generalized-gradient approximation
of the PBE34 functional was used for geometry
optimizations. To describe the interactions between valence electrons
and the ion core, the projector augmented wave (PAW) method35 was adopted. The kinetic cutoff energy for the
plane wave basis set for valence electrons was fixed at 520 eV. The
Monkhorst–Pack mesh36 with dimensions
of 3 × 3 × 3 was used to sample the first Brillouin zone.
The convergence criteria for the electronic structure and geometry
optimization were 10–5 eV and 0.02 eV/Å, respectively.
In the DOS calculations, two different functionals, PBE and HSE,37 were used, with the Monkhorst–Pack mesh
of 9 × 9 × 9 for sampling the first Brillouin zone.
