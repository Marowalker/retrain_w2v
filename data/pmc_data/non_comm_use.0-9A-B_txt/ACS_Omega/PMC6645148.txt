Density functional theory (DFT) used
to study the encapsulation
of copper(II)phthalocyanine and chlorine-substituted copper(II)phthalocyanine
to a zeolite-Y framework. Changes occurring in the redox properties,
as well as the red shift of the time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) spectra,
point out the influence of encapsulation on the geometric parameters
of the complexes. Also, the TD-DFT calculations show good agreement
with the energy changes occurred in the highest occupied molecular
orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital. DFT-based descriptors
are used for scrutinizing the reactivity of the encapsulated complexes
and a mechanism of the glycidol formation is proposed based on the
energetics involved in the transformation.

Introduction
Metallophthalocyanine
complexes, widely
known as enzyme mimic catalysts,
have been used for activating peroxides.1−4 Phthalocyanine compounds with N4-macrocycles,
an analogue to porphyrin molecule are highly stable owing to their
diverse coordination. It exhibits excellent spectroscopic properties
and reversible redox chemistry.5−8 The catalytic performance of these phthalocyanine
catalysts was hindered basically because of two main reasons: aggregation
leading to the formation of inactive dimers and oxidative self-destruction
at some point in the catalytic oxidation. To minimize these problems
various supports, such as zeolites, graphene, carbon nanotube, chitosan,
and fibrous materials (silk, cellulose), were utilized to immobilize
these catalysts.9−15 Among various supports, zeolites were considered as ideal candidates
because of their distinctive framework. The geometry and physicochemical
properties of the encapsulated complex could be altered by the topology
(voids), steric, and electrostatic constraints obliged by zeolite
framework walls. The encapsulated complex shows better reactivity
than the homogeneous counterparts of the same. These complexes are
generally used as an alternative to the most of the biosystem and
known as zeozymes.16−23

Recently, metal phthalocyanine-based complexes have been widely
used as the catalyst for alkane and alkene oxidation reactions. However,
the major drawback of this application is the mechanism and the species
which is actively involved in the mechanism is not well established.
To overcome these problems, much effort is focused to design the novel
catalyst in the aspect of mechanistic path. However, only some of
the reports have been paying attention to the use of these biomimetic
catalysts over epoxidation reactions (e.g., allyl alcohol epoxidation).24−29 Jana et al. have used Cu(II) complex encapsulated Si-MCM-41 for
the epoxidation of a variety of olefinic compounds (styrene and allyl
alcohol) using tert-BuOOH as the oxidant. The complex
has been reported showing tremendous catalytic activity with a conversion
of 73% than Cu(II) complex alone. Ti-MWW and TS-1 ZSM-5 have been
utilized for the bis(allyl)ether and allyl alcohol epoxidation, where
the catalysts oxidize effectively to their corresponding ethers, allyl
glycidyl ether, and bis(glycidyl) ether. The reaction has been supported
with 30% aqueous hydrogen peroxide.30−32 The allyl alcohol epoxidation
is a big challenge in the industrial point of view because of their
wide range of applications in the field of organic synthesis and pharmaceuticals.33−38 Allyl alcohol undergoes epoxidation and gives glycidol. Glycidol
is used as an oil additive, precursor, and stabilizer for the synthesis
of novel polymers. Because very few studies have been reported in
this area, here, we have focused on understanding the physicochemical
properties of zeolite Y-encapsulated phthalocyanine and tetrachlorine-substituted
phthalocyanine Cu(II) complexes. Geometrical and electronic alterations
in the encapsulated catalyst were studied using density functional
theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) studies to confirm the
environment of the same.

Results and Discussion
Geometrical Parameters
Planar complexes such as porphyrins
and phthalocyanines show two types of distortions such as saddle and
ruffled distortions. In ruffled geometry, because of counter-rotation
of different isoindole rings, Nβ and two isoindole
carbon atoms are displaced perpendicularly to the molecular plane.
However, in saddle-type distortion, each pair of isoindole Cβ carbon atoms lies above and below of the molecular plane together
with the axis joining pyrrole Cα atoms, and it makes
the central CuN8 ring as planar. Because of this distortion,
the ruffled geometry was not considered, and the center of inversion
of CuPc molecule also preserved as not like the saddle distortion.
The isoindole ring displacements were equivalent and upright to the
molecular plane; for this reason, only symmetric saddle distortions
have been considered. From the optimized saddle-deformed geometry,
the isoindole rings tetrahedrally distorted to accommodate into the
zeolite framework supercage, and this distortion results in lower
interaction energy.23 The geometry of CuPc
does not have a center of inversion. The optimized geometry of CuPc,
CuPcCl4, CuPc-Y, and CuPcCl4-Y complexes has
been shown as follows (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Optimized structure of the (a) CuPc, (b) CuPcCl4, (c)
CuPc-Y, and (d) CuPcCl4-Y complexes.

The geometrical parameters from B3LYP/631G(d,p) level calculations
for CuPc, CuPcCl4, CuPc-Y, and CuPcCl4-Y complexes
are given in Table 1. The calculated geometrical parameters of the CuPc are in good concurrence
with the metal phthalocyanine complex reported earlier. After encapsulation,
changes are observed in geometrical parameters of the metal complexes,
this shows that zeolite encapsulation changes the metal active sites.
The bond angle between N12–Cu–N23 is 169.97 and 166.98
for CuPc-Y and CuPcCl4-Y complexes. This shows that chlorine-substituted
phthalocyanine complexes undergoes more distortion than unsubstituted
phthalocyanine complex.

The CuPc is found to be planar and in concurrence
with the available
computational and experimental information. In 1935, Robertson reported
that the X-ray structural studies of NiPc, CuPc, and PtPc48 and revealed that the metal atom lies in a plane
surrounded with the four isoindole nitrogen atoms.

Frontier Molecular
Orbitals
It is evident that from
the Figures 2 and 3 that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)–lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) patterns were qualitatively equivalent.
Spin-unrestricted calculations performed with all the complex systems
because of copper(II) open-shell d9 configuration system.
The frontier orbital energies (spin-up and spin-down states) of CuPc,
CuPcCl4, CuPc-Y, and CuPcCl4-Y were found to
be different (Table 2).

The HOMO
and LUMO populations
of the CuPc, CuPcCl4,
CuPc-Y, and CuPcCl4-Y are presented in Figures 2 and 3, and the gap between these two states is found to be 2.19(↑),
2.23(↓) eV, 2.18(↑), 2.21(↓) eV, 3.98(↑),
3.50(↓) eV, and 4.90(↑), 5.39(↓) eV for CuPc,
CuPcCl4, CuPc-Y, and CuPcCl4-Y, respectively.
The neat complexes have planar geometry. However, the encapsulated
complexes have a distorted planar geometry because of the steric hindrance
and counterion effect of the zeolite Y framework, and this leads to
a change in the frontier orbital energy levels. A Coulombic interaction
and coordination effects exist between the zeolite walls and a metal
complex. The encapsulation stabilizes the HOMO level to a lower energy
and LUMO to a higher energy and leads to higher energy gap, and it
is found to be correlated with the absorption spectrum of the encapsulated
complex and the red shift indicates the structural distortion. Global
and local descriptors were calculated to understand the reactivity
of the molecular system.

Absorption Spectrum
TD-DFT calculations
have been performed
in various solvents using the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) basis level. Conductor-like
polarizable continuum model (C-PCM) was used for solvation effects.
Copper(II)phthalocyanine exhibits Soret bands (n → π*)
around 330–370 nm and Q (π → π*) bands around
600–780 nm. These bands have been assigned to a1u → eg and a2u → eg transitions. In gas phase, the CuPc and CuPcCl4 complexes
show Q bands at 518, 592 nm and 523, 597 nm, respectively. These bands
are red-shifted to 556, 778 nm and 592, 718 nm in the encapsulated
complexes. The Soret bands are also red-shifted from 334 and 357 nm
to 347 and 364 nm for CuPc and CuPcCl4, respectively. The
solvent effects on absorption properties were studied using different
solvents. Table 3 shows
that the largest red shift of the Q band was observed for both neat
and encapsulated complexes in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The LUMO
gets stabilized, if the transition shift to longer wavelength. According
to that, the metal complex LUMO gets stabilized while it interacts
with coordination solvents. From this, it is evident that the zeolite
supercage effectively accommodates the complexes. In consequence,
the encapsulation results in the distortion of the structure of CuPc
and CuPcCl4 because of steric hindrance.

Global Descriptors
The global descriptors
values are
in Table 2. The maximum
hardness principle49,50 reveals that the complex stability
increases with its hardness. The chemical hardness of CuPc, CuPcCl4, CuPc-Y, and CuPcCl4-Y complexes are observed
at 1.095 and 1.115 eV; 1.090 and 1.105 eV; 1.991 and 1.750 eV; and
2.452 and 2.697 eV, respectively. Thus, the encapsulated complexes
show better stability corresponding to that of the neat complexes.
The electrophilicity index of the encapsulated complexes shows that
the minimum electrophilicity and maximum hardness are responsible
for its higher reactivity. The higher chemical potential value of
the encapsulated complexes makes it more active toward electron transfer
reactions compared with the neat complexes.

Local Descriptors
Hirschfeld population analysis has
been carried out to evaluate the Fukui function (fk+ and fk–) values of copper and four nitrogens present in the complexes CuPc,
CuPcCl4, CuPc-Y, and CuPcCl4-Y (Table 4). A site having a minimum value
of Fukui function favors the hard–hard interaction, whereas
that of maximum value favors the soft–soft interaction.51−53 Because the central copper atom of the encapsulated complex shows
a minimum Fukui function value, the zeolite framework influences the
metal reactivity and enhances the hard–hard interaction.

The energies of the CuPc, CuPcCl4, CuPc-Y, and CuPcCl4-Y complexes are tabulated
in Table 5. The spin
densities are calculated for CuPc and CuPcCl4 complexes,
and they are presented in the Figure 4. The central Cu atom has high Mulliken charge density,
and the four coordinated N atoms have lesser density. The high charge
density on central Cu atom implies that the unpaired d electron is
presented on the metallic center and not over the ligands aromatic
rings.54

Possible Mechanism for
the Conversion of
Allyl Alcohol to Glycidol
in the Presence of CuPc and tBuOOH
A possible catalytic cycle for allyl alcohol transformation into
glycidol in the presence of CuPc and tBuOOH is presented in Scheme 1. The mechanism involves a direct electrophilic attack of
the peroxo group of the allyl alcohol. DFT studies focused on the
allyl alcohol epoxidation mechanism including the location of transition
states and activation barriers of oxygen transfer. The calculations
disclose that direct nucleophilic attack of the allyl alcohol at electrophilic
peroxo oxygen center is preferred. An active species CuPc* is generated
via electron transfer between CuPc and tBuOOH. This leads to the formation of CuPc–O•– intermediate by the interaction of peroxo O to Cu2+.
Finally, the transfer of oxygen from peroxide to allyl alcohol resulted
in the formation of glycidol.

Scheme 1 Possible Reaction Path for Glycidol
Formation
The addition of tertiary
butyl hydrogen peroxide to the CuPc complex
through the axial position forms a weekly bound Cu(II)Pc. tBuOOH complex via TS1. The transition step is associated
with an energy barrier of 11.8 kcal/mol. In the TS1, the oxygen atom
of tBuOOH moves toward the metal center
and leads to the formation of the Cu–O linkage. The optimized
intermediate state geometries show the weakly bound complex formed
via the interaction of the metal center with one of the peroxide–oxygen
moiety. The oxidation state of Cu in the intermediate remains as Cu(II).
Cu(III) intermediates were proposed by Hamilton et al. in galactose
oxidase base. However, later it was found to be copper(II). The experimental
reports indicate that without forming high valent copper center, Cu(II)–hydroperoxo
complexes which are present in biological system directly oxidize
the substrates.55−58 The Cu···O distance is 2.09 Å. If allyl alcohol
inserts to the metal peroxide complex, oxygen from peroxide transferred
to allyl alcohol (TS2), leading to the formation of product and CuPc
subsequently regenerated. This transition step TS2 has an energy barrier
of 7.2 kcal/mol. The energy profile diagram for this conversion is
as follows (Figure 5).

Conclusion
Square
planar phthalocyanine and tetra-chlorine substituted phthalocyanine
complexes of Cu(II) are encapsulated with zeolite-Y and studied using
different DFT studies. It revealed that zeolite framework walls impose
steric hindrance and modify the overall behavior of the complex. DFT
calculation further supports that encapsulation changes the values
of the global, local, and Fukui function values of the complexes,
resulting in the higher catalytic ability. The electron-transfer process
is responsible for the interaction of tBuOOH with metal complexes. The encapsulated complexes show better
catalytic activity than the free complexes.

Computational Method
G09 program is used to perform the density functional calculations
with B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level.39−43 The Faujasite zeolite framework has been chosen, and the cluster
dimension was reduced to 40 tetrahedral units (40T). In zeolite framework,
Si and O atoms were held on their respective crystallographic positions,
and all the terminal positions were optimized using H atoms. Al atoms
were substituted with two Si atoms, in the six-member ring satisfying
Lowenstein’s rule. The starting geometry of CuPc is taken from
the X-ray diffraction data from the literature.44 The free neat complex was first optimized in the gaseous
state followed by encapsulation inside supercage. Geometric optimizations
were done eliminating the point group constraints.

The chemical
potential (μ) and global hardness (η)
can be calculated as follows45 1   2  where ELUMO is
the LUMO energy and EHOMO is the HOMO
energy.

The global electrophilicity is calculated by Parr46 et al. as follows 3  

The calculation
of the global softness is done by 4  

The Fukui function47 of an atom, k, is calculated
using the following equations. 5   6   7  where qk(N), qk(N + 1), and qk(N – 1) are the charges of
the kth atom for the N, N + 1, and N – 1 electron systems,
respectively.

TD-DFT calculations were performed at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p)
level
from the ground-state optimized geometry. C-PCM was used for solvation
effects. We have computed 100 excitation energies. Transition states
were confirmed by frequency analysis.
