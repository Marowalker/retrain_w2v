In
this work, synthesis of two cross-linked polymeric systems through
isoxazoline ring formation using nitrile oxide–acrylate click
chemistry has been described. In the first system, styrenic block
copolymer with oxime-functionalized middle block was synthesized using S,S′-bis(α,α′-dimethyl-α″-acetic
acid)trithiocarbonate as chain-transfer agent using reversible addition
fragmentation chain-transfer technique. This block copolymer was further
utilized to prepare core cross-linked star polymers by reacting with
a four-arm acrylic cross-linker by employing environment-friendly,
nontoxic PhI(OAc)2-mediated “click reaction”
via the formation of isoxazoline ring. In the second system, two linear
styrenic block copolymers, one containing oxime and another containing
acrylate group, were reacted to form a cross-linked (CS) polymeric
system. Formation of cross-linked polymers and isoxazoline ring was
confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, gel permeation
chromatography, NMR spectroscopy, and dynamic light scattering studies.
Later, we also demonstrated that in aqueous medium these CS polymers
produced polymeric nanoparticles (NPs), which can be used as potential
carriers of hydrophobic drug molecules. The loading capacity of the
hydrophobic domains has been investigated using coumarin dyes with
varying hydrophobicity through steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopy
studies. The polymeric NPs were also shown to successfully encapsulate
a hydrophobic drug doxorubicin.

Introduction
Cross-linked polymeric
systems are a promising field of interest
due to their compact architecture, aggregation behavior in selective
solvent(s), and unique properties toward the delivery of drugs or
dye molecules. For example, core cross-linked star (CCS) polymers,
in which the polymer chains emerge from a single core, have found
applications in the field of chemical sensing, tissue engineering,
cosmetics, catalysis, etc.1−4 Tremendous efforts have been made over the last few
years to develop a facile and efficient route to synthesize a new
class of cross-linked polymer structures, including core cross-linked
star using dynamic covalent chemistry,5−7 alkyne–azide click
chemistry,2−48−11 and thiol–ene click chemistry.12−14 In this context, 1,3-dipolar
cycloaddition15 (1,3-DC) has been successfully
utilized as synthetic tool for the formation of complex architectures,
owing to its effectiveness in producing functionalized organic compounds.
Matyjaszewski10 and Hvilsted11 prepared a series of miktoarm star, and on the
other hand, cross-linking star via a one-pot synthesis has also been
reported.13,14,16,17 A highly efficient click reaction was also
used for the development of a new class of miktoarm star polymer network.
For example, synthesis of star polymers was reported using click chemistry
as major pathway, as copper-catalyzed alkyne–azide cycloaddition
was carried out, leading to the formation of 1,2,3-triazole systems.6,7,18 However, complete removal of
metals from the residue is often challenging, and considering the
cytotoxicity of metals, a significant amount of work based on metal-free
procedure for the synthesis of CCS polymers has been carried out in
recent years by Sumerlin et al.,19−21 Wiltshire and Qiao,22−25 Fulton et al.,26−28 and Otsuka et al.29−31 In this context, hypervalent
iodine(III) reagents,32−35 such as iodobenzenediacetate [PhI(OAc)2], have drawn
considerable attention due to their fairly high activity toward various
oxidative organic reactions. We have also reported the synthesis of
polystyrene-based CCS polymer assembly with acrylic functionality
at the polymer backbone with oxime-functionalized cross-linker via
1,3-dipolar cycloaddition.36

During
the last decade, to increase the efficiency of drugs with
low therapeutic index, different types of drug carriers like liposomes,37 microparticles,38 nanoparticles (NPs),39 nanoassociates,40 drug–polymer conjugates,41 and polymeric micelles42 have
been formulated. In recent years, polymeric NPs have been the object
of growing scientific attention. Polymeric NPs are soft templates
with size in the range of 10–1000 nm. This type of nanoparticles
is typically composed of a hydrophobic polymeric core, which can effectively
solubilize poorly water-soluble drugs with high loading yields.

In this work, we have reported a unique method toward the synthesis
of (i) core cross-linked star (CCS) polymers and (ii) cross-linked
(CS) polymeric systems having polystyrene backbone via the formation
of isoxazoline ring through nitrile oxide–acrylate 1,3-dipolar
cycloaddition (1,3-DC) reactions.43−45 Reversible addition
fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT), one of the most diverse controlled
polymerization techniques,47−49 has been implemented to synthesize
well-defined, controlled block copolymers using styrene-, chlorobenzyl-,
and aldehyde-functionalized monomers. This was followed by introduction
of appropriate functionality into the polymer molecules, which was
subsequently utilized for the formation of targeted CCS/CS polymers
via isoxazoline ring formation using nontoxic, environment-friendly
reagent iodobenzenediacetate [PhI(OAc)2]. Furthermore,
we show that the synthesized CS polymers had been utilized in the
formation of polymeric NPs in aqueous medium, which can potentially
be used as a potent hydrophobic drug carrier.

Results and Discussion
In this work, our objective was to synthesize polystyrene-based
linear block copolymer building blocks displaying the required pendent
functional groups for the formation of cross-linked polymers via isoxazoline
ring formation. We have synthesized two cross-linked polymeric systems:
(i) core cross-linked star (CCS) polymers and (ii) cross-linked (CS)
polymeric systems. In the first system, a styrenic block copolymer
with oxime-functionalized middle block was synthesized using RAFT
polymerization technique. A four-arm acrylic cross-linker was synthesized
via acrylation of pentaerythritol and reacted with the block copolymer
to prepare core cross-linked star (CCS) polymers by environment-friendly,
nontoxic PhI(OAc)2-mediated click chemistry via the formation
of isoxazoline ring. In the second system, two well-defined polystyrene-based
linear copolymers containing the reactive functional groups, i.e,
oxime and acrylate, were also synthesized separately by RAFT polymerization.
The polymer–polymer cross-linked (CS) systems were synthesized
from these two linear triblock copolymers. The cross-linked polymeric
systems were found to form nanoparticles (NPs) in aqueous media that
showed potential as a hydrophobic drug carrier.

Synthesis of Styrenic Core
Cross-Linked Star (CCS) Polymers
In this approach toward
the synthesis of triblock copolymers with
reactive oxime functional group in the middle of the polymer (Scheme 1A), the RAFT agent S,S′-bis(α,α′-dimethyl-α″-acetic
acid)trithiocarbonate (CTA) was used for the preparation of polystyrene
macro-CTA (P1) with controlled molecular weight (MW)
and narrow dispersity (Mn = 10 400, Đ = 1.06, Table 5). Further, P1 was used to mediate the
polymerization of 4-vinylbenzaldehyde at 80 °C in 1,4-dioxane
to form the triblock copolymer P2 (Mn = 15 400, Đ = 1.15) with
aldehyde-functionalized polystyrene as the middle block flanked by
inert polystyrene blocks at the two ends (Scheme 1A). The complete conversion of aldehyde to
oxime was confirmed by 1H NMR (Figure 1) analysis, where the aldehyde proton, showing
chemical shift at 9.87 ppm, completely disappeared and two new peaks
due to the formation of oxime appeared at 7.961 and 11.012 ppm. It
is noteworthy that postpolymerization modification reactions are usually
difficult and not quantitative. However, in the present work, the 1H NMR spectra of polymers after postpolymerization functionalization
reactions show very high efficiency. Thus, we have successfully designed
the triblock copolymers with oxime functional group as a middle block
with hydrophobic polystyrene block at the two ends of the polymer.

Scheme 1 Syntheses of (A) Oxime-Functionalized
Triblock Copolymer (P2a), (B) Oxime-Functionalized Random
Copolymer (P5), and
(C) the Acrylate-based Four-Arm Cross-Linker (CL)
For comparison purpose, a linear
polymer P4 (Scheme 1B) was also prepared,
in which styrene and 4-vinylbenzaldehyde were incorporated randomly
in the chain in 1:1 ratio using the same chain-transfer agent in 1,4-dioxane
at 70 °C for 24 h, resulting a broad distribution of molecular
weight, which may be due to the high reactive nature of 4-vinylbenzaldehyde. P4 was then purified, and the corresponding oxime derivative
(P5) was prepared through the reaction with NH2OH·HCl and NaOAc in tetrahydrofuran (THF)/H2O (1:1)
mixture. On the other hand, an acrylate-based four-arm cross-linker
(CL, Scheme 1C) was prepared by acrylation of pentaerythritol by standard
organic synthetic method.

These copolymers, block (P2a) and random (P5), were then reacted, as described below,
with CL, to
prepare the core cross-linked star (CCS) polymers. Core cross-linked
polymers were formed through isoxazoline ring formation from oxime
functionality dangling from the polymer chain and the acrylic groups
present in the cross-linker (CL). The possible architecture
of the CCS polymers formed by the reaction between P2a and CL is shown in Figure 2. The aldoxime-functionalized block (P2a) and random copolymer (P5) were reacted with
PhI(OAc)2 to produce the nitrile oxide intermediate in
situ, which was then reacted with a range of different concentrations
of cross-linker, resulting in the formation of various CCS polymers.
The CCS polymers were obtained as solid powders after the final purification.
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectral analysis was done, and
the results confirmed the reaction between oxime and acrylate, which
resulted in the formation of the isoxazoline ring. A nearly complete
disappearance of the IR signal at 3450–3480 cm–1 for the free hydroxyl group of oxime and the appearance of a peak
at 1420 cm–1 (for −C=N) indicate the
formation of isoxazoline from oxime (Figure 3a).

cross-linked star
(CCS) polymers from P2a and CL via isoxazoline
ring formation.

corresponding CS of P2a and CL (red line).
(b) GPC image of polymer P1 (red line), P2a (blue line), and CS involving P2a and CL (black line).

The CCS polymers were
further characterized by GPC analysis. Dilute
solutions (ca. 1 mg mL–1) of these polymers in THF
were used to analyze the molecular weights and dispersity (Đ) by GPC. The GPC images of these CCS polymers were
observed at much lower elution volumes compared to the reacting block
copolymers (see Figure 3b for an example), indicating a significant increase in the molecular
weights of the CCS polymers over the reacting linear triblock copolymers.
Moreover, a study of the effect of cross-linker and block copolymer
concentration on the molecular weight of the CCS polymers revealed
that a decrease in the concentration of the cross-linker as well as
the block copolymers resulted in CCS polymers of relatively low molecular
weights (Table 1).
The molecular weight data show that the concentration of the cross-linker
had more effect on the MW of the CCS polymers compared to the concentration
of the block copolymers. MW of CCS decreased significantly when CL concentration was halved keeping the polymer concentration
same, whereas upon reduction of polymer concentration keeping the
concentration of CL same, the MW of the CCS was rather
increased. Although the GPC method applied in this work does not provide
absolute value of molecular weight, the formation of high-molecular-weight
polymers was confirmed from their significantly lower elution volumes
relative to their precursor polymer (e.g., P2a).

To conclusively prove the formation
of core cross-linked polymer
network via the formation of isoxazoline derivatives, the triblock
copolymer P2a was reacted with PhI(OAc)2 and
the resulting nitrile oxides intermediate was further trapped by ethyl
acrylate. 1H NMR analysis (Figure 4) revealed the disappearance of the peak
corresponding to oxime at 7.961 and 11.02 ppm and the appearance of
new peaks at 5.225 ppm (due to the proton adjacent to oxygen) and
4.153 ppm (due to two diastereotopic protons), suggesting the formation
of isoxazoline derivative. This new synthetic strategy may be employed
effectively for the development of new polymeric architectures with
potential applications in the field of advanced material science and
technology. It is to be mentioned here that the random copolymer, P5, produced cross-linked polymeric systems, which were either
insoluble or had very low solubility in common organic solvents.

Figure 4 1H NMR spectra of click product obtained from the reaction
of P2a and ethyl acrylate.

Synthesis of Styrenic Polymer–Polymer Cross-Linked
(CS) Systems
To extent this synthetic strategy one step further,
we have synthesized aldehyde- and benzyl chloride-based random copolymers,
in which these reactive functional groups were present in comparatively
small amount (5 mol %). The chain length of these two linear polymers
was expanded by the addition of polystyrene block in various compositions
in search for the enhancement of solubility in different organic solvents.
Then, the polymers were transformed into the corresponding oxime (P7a–e)- and acrylate (P9a–e)-functionalized polymers via the reactions
described in Scheme 2. The formation of oxime-based polymers was confirmed from the proton
NMR spectra. Among P7a–e, even the
polymer with the lowest oxime concentration showed peaks of oxime
at 7.89 and 10.30 ppm [Figure S1, Supporting
Information]. On the other hand, the formation of the acrylate group
from benzyl chloride group has been proved again from proton NMR spectroscopy,
where a new peak of acrylate proton appeared at 5.65 ppm (doublet)
and peaks of the other two protons merged with those of phenyl protons
of the polymeric backbone (Figure 5). The GPC images of these polymers (P7a–e and P9a–e) showed a gradual increase in molecular weight upon addition of
more and more amount of styrene to produce the second block of the
copolymer in the second step (Figure 6). Low dispersity (Đ) values
proved the controlled nature of the polymerization process. The dynamic
light scattering (DLS) study revealed that the hydrodynamic diameter
of these copolymers remained between 1 and 10 nm (Figure 7a,b). A slightly higher size
in case of oxime copolymers than the corresponding acrylate copolymers
was corroborated by the molecular weight data. The GPC and DLS data
for the above set of polymers are tabulated in Table 2.

A
series of reactions were carried out between acrylate- and oxime-containing
polymers to synthesize CS polymers of polymer–polymer systems.
Upon completion of a cross-linking reaction, the product was completely
purified and DLS experiments were carried out using high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC)-grade dimethylformamide (DMF) as solvent
at 25 °C to measure the size of the CS produced. The size of
the CS polymers increased as the size of the reactants, i.e., acrylate-
and oxime-containing polymers, increased (Figure 7c and Table 3). We have also checked the feasibility of synthesizing
cross-linked polymers by reaction of oxime-containing copolymers (P7a–e) with CL. It was found
that the synthesis of CS polymers was also possible this way. The
size of the CS polymers produced this way was smaller than that of
polymer–polymer systems. The data for the CS polymers synthesized
by this route are presented in Table S1 and Figure S2 (Supporting Information).

CS 100	P7e–P9e	295.3	
From the data generated so far, the solubility behavior
of the
cross-linked polymeric systems studied in this work may be summarized
as follows: (a) the CCS polymer systems from triblock copolymer were
soluble in common organic solvents up to 40 mol % of cross-linker,
whereas CCS polymer systems from random copolymer of styrene and 4-vinylbenzaldehyde
were insoluble or very slightly soluble; (b) CS systems were generally
soluble in DMF or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), with the solubility observed
to increase with the length of the polystyrene inner block. The CS
systems were very poorly soluble in THF, and the solubility in THF
increased slightly with increasing “inert” polystyrene
chain length.

One of these polymer–polymer CS polymeric
systems was further
explored to find its utility. CS 75 (Table 3) was added in an aqueous medium
to find the solution behavior. It was found that the CS polymer produced
nanoparticles (NP) in aqueous medium. The size and shape of the polymeric
NP thus produced was confirmed by field emission scanning electron
microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements.
The FESEM image of the nanoparticle confirmed the size around 300
nm, which closely matched the size obtained from TEM experiment (Figure 8).

images of nanoparticles produced in aqueous
medium from CS 75.

Encapsulation of Hydrophobic Dyes and Drug in the Polymer NPs
Produced from CS
The hydrophobic drug-loading capacity of
the prepared polymeric NPs from CS polymer (CS 75) was
investigated using steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopic techniques.
Various coumarin molecules (C153, C480, and C343) were chosen as model
drug molecules to ensure the efficacy of drug loading inside the polymeric
core of the NPs. Coumarins are well-known hydrophobic molecules, and
their hydrophobicity differs depending on the various functional groups
present in the molecules. The literature reports show the following
hydrophobicity order of the used coumarin molecules: C153 > C480
>
C343.50 Hence, we could expect that if
the synthesized polymeric NPs are well enough to carry water-insoluble
drug then the incorporation of the coumarin dyes would also follow
a similar trend, i.e., the incorporation of C153 should be higher
compared to the other two coumarin dyes (C480 and C343).

To
get the preliminary idea about the incorporation of the coumarin molecules
inside the polymeric NPs, UV–vis absorption measurements were
performed. Absorption spectra of the coumarin molecules inside the
polymeric NP are shown in Figure S3 (Supporting
Information). The absorption spectra for all of the coumarin molecules
were different. C153 and C480 showed absorption peaks at around 404
and 379 nm, respectively, but no sharp peak was observed in case of
C343, indicating no incorporation of C343 into the polymeric NP. To
ascertain hydrophobicity-driven incorporation of coumarin dyes, steady-state
emission measurements were also executed, and the corresponding data
are presented in Table S2 (Supporting Information).
In pure water, C153 exhibits an emission peak at ∼549 nm51 and inside the polymeric NP it showed emission
peak at around 495 nm (λex = 408 nm) (Figure 9). This large blue shift (∼54
nm) of the emission maximum indicates the incorporation of C153 into
the hydrophobic domains of the polymeric NP. The emission peak of
C480 in pure water is nearly at 492 nm52 and inside the polymeric NP it shifted to 486 nm. The lower blue
shift of C480 was due to its less incorporation in hydrophobic domains
of NPs driven by its lower hydrophobicity than C153. We have also
performed a similar experiment with another coumarin dye, C343, which
is considered to be hydrophilic due to its anionic carboxylate moiety
at neutral pH. The emission peak of C343 in water is found to be 490
nm,53 which remained unchanged in the presence
of polymeric NP, indicating no incorporation of the investigated C343
dye inside the NP. Hence, from the above results, we can conclude
that the synthesized polymeric NP has the ability to incorporate hydrophobic
molecules and the extent of incorporation depends on the molecules’
hydrophobicity.

Figure 9 Fluorescence spectra of the various coumarin dyes inside
polymeric
NPs.

The stability of incorporated
hydrophobic dye molecules is also
an important factor for drug-delivery applications. The stability
of the incorporated model drug/dye molecules can be understood by
measuring the fluorescence lifetime of the respective dye molecules
in polymeric NPs. The obtained lifetime values are listed in Table 4, and the lifetime
decays are shown in Figure 10. From Table 4, it is clear that both the coumarin molecules, i.e., C153 and C480,
show higher lifetime inside the polymeric NP compared to that in water.
The average lifetime value for C153 is 4.01 ns with components of
1.77 ns (43%) and 5.70 ns (57%) inside the polymeric NP, whereas the
lifetime values of C153 were reported to be around 1.6–1.7
ns depending upon the pH of the solution.54 In case of C480, the average lifetime value was found to be 4.02
ns with components 1.52 ns (35%) and 5.45 ns (65%). The higher lifetime
values inside the polymeric NP suggest preferable incorporation as
well as higher stability of the dye molecules. We did not measure
the lifetime of C343 as it was not incorporated inside the polymeric
NP, as discussed previously.

and (b) C480 in polymeric
nanoparticle.

Once it was certain that the polymeric NPs could potentially
encapsulate
hydrophobic molecules, we tried to encapsulate a hydrophobic anticancer
drug doxorubicin (DOX) inside the polymeric NP. A homogeneous solution
of HPLC-grade DMF containing both polymer and DOX was added dropwise
to 5 mL of Milli-Q water. After stirring for 30 min, the solution
was dialyzed against Milli-Q water for 24 h and then the DOX-loaded
polymeric NP was collected from the dialysis bag and UV measurement
was carried out. The absorption maxima of DOX appeared at 504 nm (Figure 11) and upon comparing
the absorbance value with the standard graph, the drug-loading content
(LC) was calculated following the equation provided later and it is
found to be 17.1%. This confirmed the drug-encapsulating ability of
the polymeric NPs produced from CS systems.

the other used chemicals and solvents were purchased from Sisco Research
Laboratories Pvt. Ltd. (SRL, India) and Spectrochem (India) and purified
following the standard procedure.46S,S′-Bis(α,α′-dimethyl-α″-acetic
acid)trithiocarbonate (CTA, Scheme S1 in
Supporting Information) was synthesized according to the literature
procedure.47 Synthesis of 4-vinylbenzaldehyde

laser diode (IBH, Nanoled) and the signals were recorded at the magic
angle (54.7°) using a Hamamatsu microchannel plate photomultiplier
tube (3809U), and the instrument response was 100 ps. Decay analysis
was carried out by IBH DAS, version 6 software. The long- and short-wavelength
decays were fitted biexponentially by reckoning χ2 close to 1, indicating a good fit.

S,S′-Bis(α,α′-dimethyl-α″-acetic
acid)trithiocarbonate (CTA) (0.136 g, 0.481 mmol) and AIBN (0.20 mg,

(5 g, 48 mmol) diluted in 1.5 mL of 1,4-dioxane was then added along
with a magnetic bar. The reaction mixture was degassed and purged
thoroughly with nitrogen, and this process was repeated thrice. The
reaction vessel was then placed in an oil bath at 70 °C and stirred
for 12 h. Thereafter, the polymerization was quenched by cooling in
liquid nitrogen, followed by precipitation of the product in ice-cold
methanol. The product was then filtered and dried under high vacuum
to obtain polymer P1 as a yellow solid (∼89% yield).

Synthesis of Oxime-Functionalized
Triblock Copolymer (P2a, Scheme 1A)
Copolymer P2 (0.4
g, ∼1.2 mmol) was dissolved
in THF (8 mL), then hydroxylamine hydrochloride (0.226 g, 3.256 mmol)
and sodium acetate (0.44 g, 5.32 mmol) were added to it, and the reaction
mixture was stirred overnight at 50 °C. After completion of the
reaction, the product was obtained through precipitation in cold hexane,
washed, and dried under high vacuum for 6 h. The complete conversion
of the aldehyde group to oxime was confirmed by 1H NMR
spectrum. 1H NMR (DMSO-d6):

acid)trithiocarbonate (CTA) (0.054 g, 0.192 mmol) were taken along
with a magnetic bar. AIBN (6.3 mg, 0.0384 mmol) was then added to
the mixture, followed by addition of 1.5 mL of 1,4-dioxane. The reaction
mixture was then degassed for 5 min and purged thoroughly with nitrogen,
and this process was repeated thrice. The reaction vessel was then
placed in a preheated oil bath at 70 °C and stirred for 24 h.
Thereafter, the polymerization was quenched by cooling in liquid nitrogen,
followed by precipitation of the product in ice-cold hexane. The product
was then collected by filtration, washed thoroughly with hexane, and

oxime) (P5, Scheme 1B)
Previously synthesized P4 (0.25 g, 0.025 mmol) was dissolved in THF (4 mL) in a 25

(0.1 g, 1.43 mmol) and sodium acetate (0.157 g, 1.9 mmol) in 4 mL
of water were added to it, and the reaction mixture was stirred overnight
at room temperature. After the completion of the reaction, the aqueous
part was discarded and the product was collected by precipitating
the THF part in cold hexane, filtered, washed thoroughly, and then
dried under high vacuum for 6 h to obtain oxime-based random copolymer P5 as a yellow solid. The complete conversion of the aldehyde
group to oxime was confirmed by 1H NMR spectrum. 1H NMR (DMSO-d6): δ 0.826 (br, −(CH3)2S(C=S)S(CH3)2), 1.388 (br, CHCH2 polymer backbone),

same procedure as that of P4. Styrene (2.0 g, 0.019 mol),
4-vinylbenzaldehyde (0.132 g, 0.001 mol), and CTA (54 mg, 0.20 mmol)
were taken in a 25 mL single-neck round-bottom flask with a magnetic

added to it. The reaction mixture was then degassed, purged thoroughly
with nitrogen, like before, and stirred at 70 °C for 24 h. Upon
increase of viscosity of the reaction mixture, the polymerization
was then quenched and the polymer was recovered by precipitating in
ice-cold hexane. The precipitation was filtered, washed with ice-cold
hexane, and dried to obtain polymer P6 as a yellow solid
(80% yield). 1H NMR (CDCl3): δ 0.843 (br,

Their Corresponding Oximes (P7a–e, Scheme 2A)
The
synthetic route to prepare block copolymer containing aldehyde and
oxime groups is similar to the synthesis of P2 and P2a, as shown in Scheme 1A. P6 (0.25 g) was taken along with 25,
50, 75, and 100 equiv of styrene in the presence of AIBN (0.2 equiv)
and 1.5 mL of 1,4-dioxane. After degassing the reactor properly, the
reaction mixture was stirred at 70–72 °C for 30 h. Upon
increase in the viscosity, the reactions were quenched and precipitated
out with ice-cold hexane. Then, the polymers were dried thoroughly
and stirred overnight with NH2OH·HCl and CH3CO2Na in THF/H2O (1:1) mixture to produce the
corresponding oximes with complete conversion. 1H NMR (CDCl3): δ 0.79 (br, −(CH3)2S(C=S)S(CH3)2),

equiv with respect to the oxime group) was taken, and
the reaction with CL (1.1 equiv) in the presence of iodobenzenediacetate
(1.2 equiv) and MgSO4 (1.5 equiv) was carried out in a
double-neck round-bottom flask under nitrogen atmosphere through the
same procedure as described before. After completion of the reaction,
unreacted MgSO4 was filtered out and the compound was precipitated
in ice-cold hexane/methanol mixture.

Styrene (2.0 g, 0.019 mol), 4-vinylbenzyl
chloride (0.154 g, 0.001 mol), and CTA (54 mg, 0.20 mmol) were taken
in a single-neck round-bottom flask. AIBN (9.77 mg, 0.059 mmol) and
1,4-dioxane (2 mL) were then added to the flask. The flask was then
degassed, purged with nitrogen, in the usual manner, and stirred at
70 °C for 20 h. Upon increase in the viscosity of the reaction
mixture, the polymerization was quenched and the polymer was recovered
by precipitating the solution in ice-cold hexane. The precipitation
was filtered, washed with ice-cold hexane, and dried thoroughly to
obtain polymer P8 as a yellow solid (78% yield).

Synthesis

chloride)] (P8a–e)
P8 (0.2
g) was taken along with 25, 50, 75, and 100
equiv of styrene monomer in the presence of AIBN (0.2 equiv) and 1
mL of 1,4-dioxane. After degassing the reactor properly, the reaction
mixture was stirred at 70–72 °C for 30 h. The reactions
were quenched once the viscosity increased, and the polymer was precipitated
out in ice-cold hexane.

Formation of Acrylate-Functionalized
Copolymer (P9a–e, Scheme 2B)
First, acrylic acid
(0.18 g, 2.5 mmol) was added to dry
DMF (5 mL) in a 50 mL double-neck round-bottom flask under nitrogen
atmosphere and stirred at 60 °C. Potassium carbonate (0.7 g,
4.9 mmol) was added portionwise to the solution, followed by addition
of KI (0.05 g, 0.28 mmol), and the reaction mixture was stirred for
30 min at that temperature. Then, a solution of each of P8a–e (2.5 mmol) in dry DMF was added dropwise and
stirring was continued at 100 °C for 36 h. The reaction mixture
was cooled to room temperature, and the product was then precipitated
from ice-cold methanol, washed thoroughly, and dried under high vacuum. 1H NMR (CDCl3): δ 0.94 (br, −(CH3)2S(C=S)S(CH3)2), 1.43 (br, CHCH2 polymeric backbone),
1.88 (br, CHCH2 polymeric backbone), 5.11 (br, −CH2O-(CH=CH2), polymer), 5.75
(br, −(CH=CH2), polymer), 6.60

Formation of CS Polymer from P7b–e and P9b–e
A series of click reactions
between P7b–e and P9b–e was also carried out under the same condition.
The oxime-based
polymers (P7b–e) (1 equiv with respect
to the oxime group), the acrylate-based polymers (P9b–e) (1 equiv with respect to the acrylate group),
iodobenzenediacetate (1.2 equiv), and MgSO4 (1.5 equiv)
were reacted in dry DCM under nitrogen atmosphere for about 24 h.
The pure and dry product was collected by precipitation for two to
three times, followed by drying in high vacuum for 6 h. A dynamic
light scattering (DLS) experiment was carried out to determine the
size of the polymers using HPLC-grade DMF as solvent.

Preparation
of Polymeric Nanoparticles
Polymeric nanoparticles
were developed as follows.55 A polymer
solution in HPLC-grade THF containing CS 75 polymer was
prepared with a concentration of 0.5 mg mL–1; 500
μL of this solution was taken out and added dropwise to 2.5
mL of water stirred in a 10 mL round-bottom flask. The solution was
stirred for 30 min. Then, it was kept under vacuum to evaporate THF
and ultrasonicated for 2 min. The dye-doped polymeric nanoparticles
were synthesized in the same way, where the dye (coumarin 153, coumarin
480, and coumarin 343, Scheme 3) was added in water along with polymer during the process.

Scheme 3 Different Coumarin Dyes with Varying Hydrophobicity
Encapsulation of Doxorubicin in Polymeric
Nanoparticles
Prior to use, doxorubicin hydrochloride was
taken in ethanol, neutralized
using Et3N, and filtered to remove the precipitated salt.
Ethanol was then evaporated to obtain the neutralized solid drug. CS 75 polymer (4 mg) was dissolved in 0.5 mL of HPLC-grade
DMF. The polymeric solution was then poured into the drug vial and
the solution was allowed to become homogeneous. Milli-Q water (5 mL)
was taken in a 10 mL single-neck round-bottom flask and stirred. The
polymer–drug-containing solution was added dropwise to the
water, and the solution was continued to be stirred for 30 min. The
solution was then dialyzed against Milli-Q water via a dialysis membrane
(molecular weight cutoff, 14 kDa) for 24 h, and the external Milli-Q
water was replaced every 3 h to remove free drug molecules and DMF
completely from the polymeric solution. The drug-loading content (LC)
was determined through UV measurement from the following equation  The mass of the drug in NPs was determined
by comparing the absorbance of the DOX-loaded polymeric NPs with the
standard absorbance vs concentration graph.

Conclusions
In conclusion, this study has enabled us to demonstrate a new approach
toward the synthesis of core cross-linked star and cross-linked polymers.
The cross-linking reaction was carried out via isoxazoline ring formation
in a rapid, experimentally convenient one-pot nitrile oxide–acrylate
1,3-DC reaction. Synthesis of precursor aldehyde- and acrylate-functionalized
triblock copolymers with well-defined structures was made possible
by RAFT technique. This allowed us to control the molecular weight
and dispersity (Đ) of the arms of the CCS polymers,
thereby enabling us to control the structures. This process was also
utilized successfully to prepare cross-linked polymeric systems that
formed polymeric nanoparticles in aqueous medium with hydrophobic
domains capable of encapsulating hydrophobic dyes and drugs. This
new synthetic strategy may thus be employed effectively for the development
of new polymeric architectures with potential applications in the
field of advanced material science and technology.
