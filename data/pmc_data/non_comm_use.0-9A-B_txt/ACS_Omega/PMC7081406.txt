Fosmidomycin
inhibits IspC (1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate
reductoisomerase), the first committed enzyme in the methylerythritol
phosphate (MEP) pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis. The MEP pathway
of isoprenoid biosynthesis is essential to the causative agent of
the plague, Yersinia pestis, and is
entirely distinct from the corresponding mammalian pathway. To further
drug development, we established structure–activity relationships
of fosmidomycin analogues by assessing a suite of 17 α-phenyl-substituted
reverse derivatives of fosmidomycin against Y. pestis IspC. Several of these compounds showed increased potency over fosmidomycin
with IC50 values in the nanomolar range. Additionally,
we performed antimicrobial susceptibility testing with Y. pestis A1122 (YpA1122). The bacteria
were susceptible to several compounds with minimal inhibitory concentration
(MIC) values ranging from 128 to 512 μg/mL; a correlation between
the IC50 and MIC values was observed.

Introduction
The plague, also known
as the “Black Death,” is caused
by the bacterium Yersinia pestis.1 The discovery of antibiotics, beginning with
the introduction of penicillin in the 1940s,2 was anticipated to be the end of bacterial diseases.3 However, the evolution of antibiotic resistance has since
resolved this notion. In fact, the increase in drug resistance has
coincided with a decline in antibiotic discovery.3 Compounding the issue of antibiotic resistance is the threat
of bioterrorism, which became a reality with the 2001 anthrax attacks.3,4

In 2000, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC)
released a response plan for bioterrorism, wherein they categorized
several infectious agents according to their likelihood to be used
as biothreats.5 According to the CDC, Y. pestis is presently classified as a “category
A” bioterrorism agent, that is, a high-priority agent.5 High-priority agents are classified as such by
their ease of transmission, high mortality rate, and likelihood to
require a specialized public health response.5

Antibiotic treatment is effective against plague bacteria;6 however, a 2017 plague outbreak in Madagascar
resulted in approximately 2417 cases and 209 deaths within a period
of 4 months.7 The plague takes two main
clinical forms: bubonic and pneumonic.6 Thirty to sixty percent of cases of bubonic plague result in fatality,6 and, if left untreated, pneumonic plague is always
fatal.1 Given the nature of antibiotic
resistance, the need for preventative biothreat countermeasures, and
the recent plague epidemics in Madagscar,7 continued development of antibiotics is necessary for the prevention
of widespread outbreaks and deaths.

Isoprenoids are one of the
largest and most diverse group of natural
products, enumerating over 30,000 known products.8,9 They
are fundamental biomolecules involved in vital biological functions
such as electron transport and peptidoglycan biosynthesis in bacteria.8,10,11 Bacteria synthesize isoprenoids
via the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis.12,13 The MEP pathway is entirely distinct from the corresponding mammalian
pathway, the mevalonic acid pathway, making it an attractive target
for antibiotic development.12,13

Previously, we
cloned, expressed, and characterized the first committed
enzyme of the MEP pathway, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate
reductoisomerase (DXR/IspC) from Y. pestis.14 IspC catalyzes the reduction and isomerization
of 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) to yield 2-C-methylerythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) (Figure 1).15 Furthermore,
we demonstrated the effectiveness of inhibiting both the purified Y. pestis enzyme (YpIspC) and liquid cultures of Y. pestis using the known IspC inhibitor, fosmidomycin
(Figure 1).14

Figure 1 Inhibition of IspC by fosmidomycin.

Previous studies have shown that α-phenyl substitutions of
reverse derivatives of fosmidomycin are efficacious.16−18 Furthermore, crystal structures of IspC- and α-phenyl-substituted
reverse derivatives of fosmidomycin have been resolved.19−21 However, no crystal structures of YpIspC in the presence of fosmidomycin
or one of its analogues have been resolved. Therefore, to elucidate
the structure–activity relationships (SARs) of α-phenyl-substituted
reverse derivatives of fosmidomycin, we systematically assessed the
potency of 17 compounds against YpIspC and performed antimicrobial
susceptibility assays with YpA1122. Specifically,
we assessed the effect of methylene, oxygen, or sulfur at the β-position,
the electron-donating or -withdrawing effects of the substituents
on the α-phenyl ring, and the substitution pattern of the α-phenyl
ring (Figure 2).

Figure 2 α-Phenyl-substituted
β-carba, thia, oxa reverse fosmidomycin
analogues. The β position, X, is either carbon (β-carba),
sulfur (β-thia), or oxygen (β-oxa). R, R1,
and R2 are either CH3, OCH3, Cl,
or F.

Results and Discussion
Biological Evaluation of
IspC Inhibitors
All assayed
compounds were synthesized according to previously described procedures.19−24 The addition of differently substituted phenyl rings at the α-position
of fosmidomycin analogues can increase their potency against IspC
enzymes from bacteria and the protozoan, Plasmodium
falciparum.17,19−21,24 However, to our knowledge, no
inhibitors from this class have been tested against YpIspC. Furthermore,
no crystal structures of YpIspC bound to fosmidomycin or one of its
analogues have been resolved. To expand upon our understanding of
SARs between YpIspC and fosmidomycin analogues, we screened a comprehensive
library of our α-phenyl substituted reverse fosmidomycin analogues
(Table 1). The determined
half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50 values) and
the determined minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for each compound
are presented in Table 1. YpA1122 is indicated as being either resistant
(R), or susceptible (S), to each compound.

a YpIspC = IspC from Y. pestis, IC50 = half-maximal inhibitory
concentration. All assays were performed in duplicate.

b YpA1122 = Y. pestis strain A1122, MIC = minimal inhibitory
concentration, R = resistant, S = susceptible. Six replicates were
performed for each compound.

c The IC50 value for this
compound has been published previously.14 IC50 values of fosmidomycin against IspC from Escherichia coli, Francisella tularensis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and P. falciparum are 0.035 μM (0.22 μM has
also been reported), 0.247, 0.080, and 0.14 μM respectively.14,19

The most potent compounds
in Table 1 (β-thia
and β-carba analogues 3b, 3d, 3e, and 4b) are twice
as potent as fosmidomycin, with IC50 values in the nanomolar
range. To assess the effect of replacing the β-methylene group
with either a sulfur or oxygen atom, the potency of four isosteric
sets of β-carba, β-thia, and β-oxa analogues (1a–1c, 2a–2c, 3a–3c, and 3d–3f) was determined. For each set of
isosteres, the β-thia analogues showed increased inhibition
over their β-carba and β-oxa counterparts, with the β-oxa
analogues showing the lowest levels of inhibition among the three.
This pattern of inhibition was observed for both the enzymes and the
bacteria. These results are consistent with our previous findings
with IspC orthologs from Escherichia coli and Mycobacterium tuberculosis.20 Taken together, these results further establish
that replacement of the β-methylene group with a sulfur atom
is an effective strategy for the development of reverse fosmidomycin
analogues for IspC proteins of bacterial origins.

Concomitantly,
the electron-donating or -withdrawing effects of
the substituents on the α-phenyl ring were assessed. The compounds
contained either electron-donating groups (CH3, OCH3, compounds 2a–d, 3g, 4a) or electron-withdrawing groups (Cl, F, compounds 3a–f, 4b, 5). Compounds without
substituents on the α-phenyl ring were assessed for comparison
(compounds 1a–c). Compounds containing electron-donating
groups showed decreased potency over analogues without substitutions
on the α-phenyl ring. Compound 1a is three times
more potent than its methylated analog, 2a, and 12 times
more potent than its 3,4-dimethoxyphenyl analog 3g. Furthermore,
compounds 2a and 3g have no activity against
the bacteria at 512 μg/mL. Similarly, YpA1122
is susceptible to 1b at 128 μg/mL, whereas YpA1122 is susceptible to its methylated analog, 2b, at 256 μg/mL, and resistant to its 3,5-dimethoxyphenyl analog, 4a, at 512 μg/mL.

Conversely, compounds containing
electron-withdrawing groups showed
increased potency over analogues without substitutions or electron-donating
groups on the α-phenyl ring. 3,4-Difluorophenyl analog, 3d, is three times more potent than 1a, and 42
times more potent than 3g. Similarly, 3,4-dichlorophenyl
analog, 3b, is 20 times more potent than 3,5-dimethoxyphenyl
analog, 4a. Four compounds were further examined to probe
the effect of the substitution pattern of the α-phenyl ring.
3,4-Difluorophenyl compound, 3e, was more potent than
its 3,5-difluorophenyl isostere, 4b. This correlation
can also be observed with the Y. pestis bacterium. YpA1122 is susceptible to 3e at 128 μg/mL, whereas YpA1122 is susceptible
to 4b at 256 μg/mL. Additionally, 3,4-difluorophenyl
compound, 3f, is three times more potent than its 2,4-difluorophenyl
isostere, 5. Altogether, these results demonstrate that
compounds containing electron-withdrawing groups (Cl, F) show promise
for inhibitor design and suggest that 3,4-substitution patterns are
more promising than 3,5- or 2,4-substitution patterns. Further study
is warranted to confirm the SARs of the substitution pattern conclusively.

In E. coli, fosmidomycin is known
to enter bacterial cells via the glycerol-3-phosphate transporter
(GlpT).25−27 Conversely, fosmidomycin uptake is limited in other
organisms, such as M. tuberculosis,
by the lack of a GlpT.26 Previously, using
a BLAST search with the E. coli K12
GlpT sequence (accession no. P08194), we identified a homologous
transport protein (accession no. YP_002347496) in the Y. pestis CO92 proteome.14 A BLAST search with this transport protein (accession no. YP_002347496) identifies a homologous transporter (accession no. AEL73320,
100% identity) in the Y. pestis A1122
proteome (taxonomy ID: 1035377).

It is possible that uptake
of fosmidomycin and/or fosmidomycin
analogues 1a, 1b, 2b, 3b, 3d, 3e, and 4b is
fully or partially dependent on the Y. pestis A1122 transporter. Previous studies have also shown that uptake
of fosmidomycin analog, FR900098, is only partially dependent on GlpT,
and that uptake of lipophilic phosphonate prodrugs of fosmidomycin
analogues is not dependent on GlpT.28 In
these studies, the more hydrophobic nature of these compounds was
attributed as a source of their partial-dependence or independence
on GlpT.28 Future study is warranted to
confirm the mechanism of uptake of these analogues and to assess their
dependence on a transporter protein to enter the cell. Nonetheless,
the enzyme SARs offer insight for the direction of future synthesis
and possibly a lipophilic phosphonate prodrug strategy may yield better
bacterial growth inhibition.

Conclusions
In
summary, we report kinetic data and antimicrobial susceptibility
data to establish SARs of a suite of 17 α-phenyl substituted
reverse derivatives of fosmidomycin for YpIspC. These compounds varied
by substitution of the β-methylene with oxygen or sulfur, addition
of electron-donating or -withdrawing substituents on the α-phenyl
ring, and by the substitution pattern of the α-phenyl ring.
Our results showed that replacement of the β-methylene group
with a sulfur atom is a useful strategy for developing reverse fosmidomycin
analogues for YpIspC. This result is consistent with other IspC proteins
of bacterial origins. We also found that attaching electron-donating
substituents to the α-phenyl ring is not a useful strategy for
developing reverse fosmidomycin analogues for YpIspC. Lastly, our
results show that 3,4-difluorophenyl substitutions are more potent
than 3,5- or 2,4-difluorophenyl substitutions; however, further study
is needed to unequivocally establish the relationship between potency
and the substitution pattern. These results provide useful information
for the future development of novel IspC inhibitors.

Experimental
Section
Bacterial Cell Culture
Recombinant proteins were expressed
in E. coli BL21 CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL
cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). E. coli was cultured at 37 °C in Luria–Bertani (LB) media supplemented
with 100 μg/mL ampicillin and 50 μg/mL chloramphenicol
with constant shaking at 250 rpm. Agar (1.5% wt/vol) was added to
prepare solid media. Y. pestis strain
A1122 was obtained through the NIH Biodefense and Emerging Infections
Research Resources Repository, NIAID, NIH. The YpA1122 bacterial isolates were subcultured on blood agar plates (tryptic
soy agar with 5% sheep blood) 48 h prior to antimicrobial susceptibility
testing.

Expression and Purification of Y. pestis IspC
Y. pestis IspC was
cloned, expressed, and purified as described previously.14 The Y. pestis ispC gene was synthesized (GenScript USA Inc, Piscataway, NJ) and
cloned into a pET101/D-TOPO vector to facilitate the expression of
a C-terminal His6-tagged protein. The plasmid was transformed
into chemically competent E. coli BL21
CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for protein expression.

To express the His6-tagged protein, 1 L of LB media
was inoculated with a 10 mL overnight seed culture and incubated with
shaking at 37 °C and 250 rpm. At an OD600 of 1.8,
protein expression was induced by addition of isopropyl b-d-thiogalactopyranoside to 0.5 mM. After protein induction,
the culture was incubated with shaking at 37 °C and 250 rpm for
an additional 18 h. Cells were harvested via centrifugation (4648g, 20 min, 4 °C) and stored at −80 °C.
Protein was subsequently isolated and purified from the cells via
chemical lysis and affinity chromatography.

Cells were lysed
with lysis buffer 1 (100 mM Tris pH 8.0, 0.032%
lysozyme, 3 mL per gram cell pellet), followed by lysis buffer 2 (0.1
M CaCl2, 0.1 M MgCl2, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.020% DNase,
0.3 mL per gram cell pellet). The clarified cell lysate was collected
after centrifugation (48,000g, 20 min, 4 °C)
and passed through a TALON immobilized metal affinity column (Clontech
Laboratories, Mountain View, CA).

The column was washed with
20 column volumes of equilibrium buffer
(50 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES)
pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl), 10 column volumes of wash buffer 1 (50 mM HEPES
pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole), and 15 column volumes of wash
buffer 2 (100 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 600 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole). The
protein was eluted with 5 column volumes of elution buffer (150 mM
imidazole pH 7.0, 300 mM NaCl), and then exchanged into storage buffer
(0.1 M Tris pH 7.5, 1 mM NaCl, 5 mM dithiothreitol) during concentration
by ultrafiltration. The protein concentration was determined using
Advanced Protein Assay Reagent (Cytoskeleton, Denver CO) with γ-globulins
(Sigma-Aldrich) as the standard. Purified protein was visualized via
Coomassie-stained sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
The yield of YpIspC averaged 30 mg per 1 L of culture.

Enzyme Assays
Y. pestis IspC activity was assayed
at 37 °C by spectrophotometrically
monitoring the enzyme catalyzed oxidation of NADPH upon addition of
1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP, Echelon Biosciences,
Salt Lake City, UT) to the assay mixture, as described previously.29 The oxidation of NADPH was monitored at 340
nm using an Agilent 8453 UV–visible Spectrophotometer equipped
with a temperature-regulated cuvette holder. All assays were performed
in duplicate.

Half-maximal inhibition (IC50) of enzyme
activity was determined using nonlinear regression of a plot of fractional
enzyme activity as a function of inhibitor concentration (sigmoidal
dose–response curve) using GraphPad Prism 5.0, wherein the
top plateau of the curve was set to 100% residual enzyme activity.
As fosmidomycin is a slow, tight-binding inhibitor,15 the fosmidomycin analogues were preincubated with the enzyme
at 37 °C for 10 min prior to the addition of the substrate, DXP.

Antimicrobial Susceptibility Assays
The MIC of each
compound was determined using the broth microdilution method outlined
by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI).30 Briefly, the compounds were twofold diluted
in cation-adjusted Mueller–Hinton Broth (CAMHB) in 96-well
round-bottom, polystyrene microtiter plates to final concentrations
ranging from 1 to 512 μg/mL. Wells containing broth only served
as growth and sterility controls. YpA1122 was cultured
on blood agar plates (tryptic soy agar with 5% sheep blood) at 37
°C for 48 h. After 48 h, the colonies were directly suspended
in phosphate buffered saline and diluted in CAMHB before inoculation
into the wells of the 96-well plate to yield a final starting inoculum
concentration of approximately 5 × 105 colony-forming
units (CFUs)/mL. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h.
The MIC was recorded as the lowest concentration of compound that
inhibited visible bacterial growth after 24 h of incubation (i.e.,
no turbidity is observed and optical density at 600 nm is zero). Six
replicates were performed for each compound.

Synthesis of Compounds
The synthesis of the carba analog 1a was performed
according to Behrendt et al., 2010 and the
carba analogues 2a, 2d, 3a,
and 3d according to Behrendt et al., 2011.19,23 The thia analogues 1b, 2b, 3b–c were synthesized following the same procedures described by Kunfermann
et al., 2013 and the analogues 4a–b according
to Lienau et al., 2019.20,24 The oxa analogues 1c, 2c, 3c, 3f, and 5 were synthesized according to Brücher et al., 2012
and the 3,4 dimethoxy analog, 3g, was synthesized according
to Konzuch et al., 2014.21,22
