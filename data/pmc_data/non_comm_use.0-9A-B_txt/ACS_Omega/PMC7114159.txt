Toxic
solvents such as dimethylformamide (DMF) are widely used
for the preparation of polymeric membranes due to the strong dissolving
power. Environmentally friendly solvents are available, but the developed
membranes suffered from low performance due to the poor solubility
of the polymer in the solvent. In this work, polyetherimide membranes
were prepared using DMF with the addition of the biodegradable solvent
γ-butyrolactone (GBL). Results show that mixing 75 wt % of DMF
with 25 wt % GBL enhanced the membrane gas permeability toward hydrogen,
methane, helium, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen. The overall permeability
was increased by 9.6% compared to the permeability of the membrane
made by 100 wt % DMF. Hydrogen-to-methane selectivity was also raised
from 26.3 to 29.3.

1 Introduction
Interest in implementing
green chemistry in industrial processes
has increased remarkably in recent years. The concept aims to reduce
energy consumption and minimize generated waste.1 This can be achieved by redesigning the process, for example,
alternating feedstock or changing the solvents.2 Preparation of gas-separation membranes involves the use
of toxic solvents like N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP)
and dimethylformamide (DMF) because they can dissolve the polymer
at room temperature. However, these solvents are reported to be harmful
if they made contact with the eye or skin. The solvent may also damage
the reproduction system or the unborn child as shown in Table 1. Furthermore, the solvents
may harm the aquatic life; therefore, they need special treatment
before disposal to the sewage system. Many researchers tried to substitute
the toxic solvents with the green ones, but the selection critically
affects the membrane performance as the solvent defined the physical
structure.3 Therefore, the green solvents
should have properties similar to the toxic ones in term of boiling
point, viscosity, and solubility. For liquid separation, researchers
managed to replace the traditional solvents with biodegradable ones.
For example, methyl lactate (ML) was successfully changed from NMP
for the preparation of cellulose acetate for water separation without
a drop in performance.4 However, the case
is different for gas-separation membranes because the formation of
a dense layer is required instead of a porous one. The transport mechanism
in dense membranes is based on the solution-diffusion model where
the gas is adsorbed and dissolved at the membrane surface.5 After that, the gas diffuses through the membrane
by means of free volumes. These volumes work similar to tiny pores,
but they differ from physical pores as their shape and location can
change based on the operating conditions.6

A previous study showed that nontoxic solvents such as ML, ethyl
lactate, propylene carbonate, tributyl o-acetyl citrate,
tributyl citrate, and triethyl phosphate failed to prepare a polyetherimide
(PEI) membrane for gas separation due to the poor solubility even
at an elevated temperature of 100 °C.7 Nevertheless, the green solvent γ-butyrolactone (GBL) dissolved
PEI, but the solution was very viscous making it more difficult to
cast. The researchers managed to prepare the PEI membrane from GBL,
but unfortunately, the performance of GBL membranes, in term of hydrogen
permeance, was extremely low compared to membranes prepared by NMP.
This sharp drop in the performance was interpreted by the formation
of a densified layer by GBL, which limited the gas diffusion.7

Another approach to using the green solvents
is by blending them
with the toxic ones to reduce the human and environmental impact.
The objective of this study was to investigate the possibility of
mixing toxic and nontoxic solvents for the preparation of polymeric
membranes to minimize the toxicity of the generated waste. In this
paper, PEI membranes were prepared using a mixed solvent of DMF and
GBL with different concentrations of 25, 50, and 75 wt % GBL, balanced
with DMF. PEI was selected as a polymer because of the excellent thermal
and mechanical stability.8 The polymer
is also gas-permeable and has excellent permeability toward hydrogen,
helium, and carbon dioxide.9 It has a chemical
formula of (C39H30N2O6)n with a molecular weight of 30,000
Da. Gas permeance and selectivity of the fabricated membranes were
measured and compared to the membranes made by 100 wt % DMF. Characterization
techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction
(XRD) had been utilized to observe any changes in the structure due
to the addition of GBL to DMF. Hansen’s model was also used
to study the equilibrium interaction between the solvents and the
polymer.

2 Materials and Methods
PEI membranes
were prepared using the phase-inversion method and
DMF as a solvent. DMF is an organic solvent with a chemical formula
of C3H7NO. It is colorless with a fishy smell
and has a high boiling point of 153 °C.10 DMF has been selected over NMP because in the previous study, PEI
membranes prepared by NMP showed a lower permeability and selectivity.7 This suggests that DMF has a better interaction
with the polymer, and the chain was more stretched with DMF. First,
PEI pellets (Sigma-Aldrich) were added to DMF (99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich)
to form a solution of 27 wt % PEI. The membrane was prepared initially
with different concentrations of 23, 27, and 30 wt % PEI, but 27 wt
% gave the best membrane performance.7 The
solution was heated and mixed overnight to form a homogeneous solution.
After that, the solution was poured on a glass sheet, and it was tape-casted
to form a film with a thickness of 300 μm. Next, the glass was
immersed in water to exchange the solvent and precipitate the polymer.
The membrane was kept to dry overnight and then cut into a disc with
47 mm diameter. Before operation, the membrane was heated to 110 °C
to remove the residual solvent. This procedure was repeated, but for
mixed solvents, the following three concentrations were used: 75 wt
% DMF–25 wt % GBL, 50 wt % DMF–50 wt % GBL, and 25 wt
% DMF–75 wt % GBL. The membranes were also prepared using GBL
alone (99%, Sigma Aldrich) for comparison.

GBL has been selected
as an environmentally friendly solvent because
it is biodegradable as it discomposes in water to γ-hydroxybutyric
acid and then to carbon dioxide.11 It is
a colorless liquid with a creamy odor and has a chemical formula of
C4H6O2 with a boiling point of 204
°C.12 GBL was used before as a nutritional
supplement for weight loss and sleep; however, the chemical was banned
by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1990 because it can cause
death if taken with alcohol.13 It should
be noted that pure GBL is still harmful if it made contact with skin
or eyes despite being biodegradable in water.

The morphology
of the membranes was examined using an SEM (JEOL,
JSM-IT300) with INKA Oxford instrumentation with a voltage of 20 kV.
Prior to scanning, the membranes were immersed in liquid nitrogen
for 5 min and then cut to obtain the cross-sectional area. After that,
the samples were gold-coated using a sputter coater (Polaron, SC7620)
with a current of 18–20 mA for 45 s.

The membranes were
characterized using an SEM (JEOL, JSM-IT300)
to examine the cross-sectional surface. XRD (PANalytical, Empyrean
XE) was also utilized to determine the structure of the polymer and
calculate the distance between the chains, which is known as d-space. After characterization, the membranes were evaluated
for gas separation using a membrane permeation unit (Convergence Inspector
Neptunus). The unit consists of a membrane cell and mass flowmeters
as shown in Figure 1. Pure gases (Kuwait Oxygen & Acetylene Company, KOAC, 99.99%)
such as hydrogen, methane, helium, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen were
fed independently to the cell at a rate of 100 L h–1 using a flowmeter. The feed pressure was set to 5 bar, and the temperature
was constant at 25 °C. The unit measures the permeate flow rate
(using a flowmeter), and the permeance was calculated by the following
equation, in gas permeation unit (GPU): 1  where Vp is the permeate volume flow
rate (cm3 s–1), A is
the active membrane area of 12.6 cm2, and ΔP is the pressure difference
across the membrane (cmHg). Gas ideal selectivity was calculated based
on the permeability of two gases. For example, for hydrogen-to-methane
selectivity, the following equation was applied: 2  where PH2 and PCH4 are the permeabilities of hydrogen
and methane, respectively. Separation of hydrogen from methane can
represent hydrogen recovery from a refinery off-gas. The membrane
performance for helium purification was measured by determining its
selectivity to methane and nitrogen. Natural gas purification and
flue gas treatment were demonstrated by measuring the selectivity
of carbon dioxide toward methane and nitrogen, respectively.14

Figure 1 Schematic diagram of the membrane permeation unit.

Hansen’s solubility parameters were also
used to study the
molecular interaction between the solvents and the polymer. The model
consists of three components: dispersion (δd), dipolar
intermolecular force (δp), and hydrogen bond (δh). These parameters present a three-dimensional sphere known
as the Hansen space. The distance (d) between the
solvent and the polymer can be then calculated based on the solubility
parameters of the solvent and the polymer as follows:15 3  For solvent mixtures, Bagley’s
equation can be applied to calculate the components of the mixture16 4   5   6  where a and b are the weight fractions
of solvent a and b, respectively.
Relative energy difference (RED) is a parameter for predicting the
solubility of the solvent and the polymer, and it can be calculated
by17 7  where R0 is the interaction radius of
the sphere in the Hansen space.
This radius is determined experimentally, and it is unique for the
polymer. The solvent dissolving power increases as the RED value approaches
close to zero.18

3 Results
and Discussion
The produced membranes were tested for hydrogen,
methane, helium,
carbon dioxide, and nitrogen, and the permeability data is given in Table 2. It is clear that
the membrane made by GBL only suffered from the low hydrogen permeance
of 0.5 GPU. On the other hand, the membrane made by DMF gave an excellent
permeance of 20.8 GPU. Surprisingly, the membrane made by 75 wt %
DMF and 25 wt % GBL achieved a permeance of 23.4 GPU, which exceeded
the permeance of the DMF membrane. The membranes made by 50 wt % DMF–50
wt % GBL and 25 wt % DMF–75 wt % GBL however gave a lower permeance
of 15.9 and 9.0 GPU, respectively. Similar to hydrogen, the membrane
made by 75 wt % DMF and 25 wt % GBL gave the highest permeance toward
methane, helium, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen. Overall, the gas permeance
increased by 9.6% compared to the permeance of the 100 wt % DMF membrane.
In terms of ideal selectivity, the membranes made by GBL solely gave
a low hydrogen-to-methane selectivity of 5.9; whereas, the 100 wt
% DMF membrane showed a selectivity of 26.3. Again, the membrane made
by 75 wt % DMF and 25 wt % GBL resulted in a selectivity of 29.3.
The membrane also showed the maximum selectivity for hydrogen-to-nitrogen,
helium-to-methane, helium-to-nitrogen, carbon dioxide-to-methane,
and carbon dioxide-to-nitrogen as shown in Table 3. The results in Tables 2 and 3 were obtained
twice to confirm the reliability of the data. Two samples were tested
for each solvent composition. The error was within the acceptable
range of 5–10%.

Compared to other researchers’
work with a similar experimental
setup, the permeability and selectivity of the developed membrane
of this study showed better results. For example, Shamsabadi et al.
prepared PEI membranes with a concentration of 28 wt % using NMP.19 The membrane thickness was also 300 μm,
but the membrane showed a low hydrogen permeance of 1 GPU at 5 bar
with a hydrogen-to-methane selectivity of only 17.

The developed
membranes were characterized by SEM to investigate
any changes in the structure. The top surface of the membranes was
examined, and it was free from defects such as holes and cracks. The
images of the cross-sectional area are given in Figure 2, and the membrane made by 100 wt % GBL showed
almost a totally dense layer; whereas, other samples showed a combination
of a porous and a dense structure. It is known that the dense layer
controls the membrane permeability and selectivity.20 Measurements of the dense layer of all membrane samples
are given in Table 4. The 100 wt % GBL membrane has the highest thickness of 10.8 μm,
and this interprets the lowest gas permeability due to diffusion limitation.
Furthermore, the change in porosity may also affect the gas permeance.

100 wt % GBL	10.8	
The poor interaction
between the polymer and GBL solvent may prevent
chain stretching and cause coiling leading to the formation of the
densified layer.21 Other researchers also
observed a drop in the permeability and selectivity when the membrane
thickness was increased, and they related it to the change in the
gas molecule enthalpy and entropy due to the change in void volume.22 On the other hand, the 100 wt % DMF membrane
had a thinner layer of 7.7 μm; whereas, the membrane made by
75 wt % DMF and 25 wt % GBL had the lowest thickness of 6.9 μm.
The reduction in thickness could be related to the increase in solvent
viscosity as DMF has a viscosity of 0.9 cP, while GBL has a viscosity
of 1.7 cP. Furthermore, it is reported that GBL has a higher interaction
with water,23 and this may increase the
exchange rate between the solvent and water to form a sponge-like
structure with uniform medium-sized holes (Figure 2b). In membrane processes, reducing the thickness
of the dense layer is generally favorable as it gives the maximum
permeability and selectivity due to the absence of diffusion and solubility
limitations.24 Other researchers also noticed
an improvement in the permeability of the PEI membrane when the thickness
of the densified layer was reduced.25 It
was related to the high solubility of carbon dioxide due to the interaction
with the polymeric chain. Furthermore, the lower kinetic diameter
of carbon dioxide compared to nitrogen also enhanced the permeance.
The change in thickness may also alter the crystallinity level, crystallinity
orientation, and the number of free volumes.26

Samples were additionally analyzed by XRD, and data is given
in Figure 3. Samples
made from
100 wt % GBL, 25 wt % DMF–75 wt % GBL, and 50 wt % DMF–50
wt % GBL show a very high intensity indicating that the structure
is more crystallized. Some researchers noticed that the higher the
intensity, the lower the permeance due to the limitation in molecular
diffusion.27 This finding also matches
the results in this study where enriched GBL membranes suffered from
the low permeance. For the sample prepared by 75% DMF and 25% GBL,
the intensity is slightly higher than the intensity of the 100 wt
% DMF membrane. Therefore, it was expected to see a drop in the membrane
permeance in the 75 wt % DMF–25 wt % GBL membrane; however,
the slight increase in intensity is actually reported to enhance the
permeance due to the increase in the interfacial space between the
amorphous and crystalline structure.28

Figure 3 XRD analysis
of the produced PEI membranes by mixed solvents.

XRD was used as well to calculate the distance between polymer
chains (d-space). The data is given in Table 5, and changing or mixing the
solvents did not alter the d-space value. Some researchers
also noticed that the d-space value did not change
when the solvent was altered.29

Hansen’s solubility parameters
were used to calculate solubility
of solvent mixtures with the polymer using eqs 3–7. The data
is given in Table 6. Using a pure DMF solvent gives a RED of 1.1, while using pure GBL,
RED increased to 1.5. This confirms that the solubility of GBL is
less than that of DMF, and this may interpret the low performance
of GBL membranes. For the 75 wt % DMF–25 wt % GBL membrane,
which shows the highest performance in terms of permeability and selectivity,
RED slightly increased to 1.2. It should be noted that, in RED calculations,
the solvent is considered as a “good solvent” when the
value is higher than the unity. However, in this study, all the values
are over the unity. This does not automatically mean that DMF is a
poor solvent as the Hansen’s model does not take some properties
in consideration such as temperature, polymer morphology, and solvent
molecular size.30 Experimental work is
necessary to confirm the reliability of Hansen’s results.

100 wt % GBL	19	16.6	7.4	9.2	1.5	
In the environmental
point of view, the solution of 75 wt % DMF
and 25 wt % GBL is considered toxic and harmful to aquatic life because
it is still concentrated with DMF. It was difficult to use GBL alone
to form PEI membranes because of the low permeance and selectivity.
Other eco-friendly solvents should be tested to seek the possibility
of substituting DMF.

4 Conclusions
Preparation
of polymeric membranes generally involves the use of
toxic solvents such as DMF due to the strong dissolving power. However,
special care is needed when handling these solvents due to possible
skin and eye irritation. Furthermore, the solvents will require a
chemical treatment before disposal to prevent harm to aquatic life.
Many researchers tried to substitute the toxic solvents with environmentally
friendly ones, but the fabricated membranes had a lower gas permeance
and selectivity. In this work, the nontoxic solvent GBL was mixed
with DMF with three different concentrations of 25, 50, and 75 wt
% GBL, balanced with DMF. The developed membranes were tested for
separation of various gases such as hydrogen, methane, helium, carbon
dioxide, and nitrogen. It was found that the membrane made by 75 wt
% DMF and 25 wt % GBL had the best permeance and selectivity. The
addition of GBL to DMF improved hydrogen permeance from 20.8 to 23.4
GPU with an increase in hydrogen-to-methane selectivity from 26.3
to 29.3. Characterization techniques such as SEM revealed that adding
25 wt % GBL to DMF reduced the thickness of the selective layer from
7.7 to 6.9 μm. The membrane improvement was also linked to the
increase in XRD intensity as the structure becomes more crystallized.
Furthermore, the addition of GBL changed the viscosity and raised
the interaction with water, and this resulted in formation of a sponge-like
structure, which facilitated the gas diffusion. Hansen’s model
was also used to predict the solubility parameters of the mixture
solvents, and the model reported that GBL has a lower solubility with
PEI. This matched the experimental data as GBL membranes suffered
from the lower performance. However, Hansen’s model did not
give key information on the 75 wt % DMF–25 wt % GBL membranes
as the RED value slightly increased from 1.1 to 1.2. This was connected
to the limitation of the model as it did not take in consideration
the temperature, molecular size, and polymer morphology.
