A green
modification has been introduced to the synthesis of benzothiazoles
by using polymethylhydrosiloxane (PMHS) for successive steps of benzotriazole
ring cleavage and cyclization, an approach which was previously developed
in our lab by the use of n-Bu3SnH. The
use of the silicone industry byproduct PMHS makes this protocol a
cost-effective and nontoxic one and thus may be considered for the
industrial importance.

Introduction
The benzotriazole ring
cleavage (BtRC) methodology has emerged
as an interesting approach for facile synthesis of a variety of compounds
including heterocycles.1,2 Reaction conditions, such as thermolysis,
photolysis, organometallic reagent oxidants, and free radical reagents,
cause the cleavage of the relatively stable benzotriazole ring, exhibiting
fascinating chemistry.3,4 The low cost, stability, and nontoxic
nature of benzotriazole moiety makes this approach an easy and economical
method for organic synthesis of a large number of valuable compounds.5

Our group has been involved in the exploration
of interesting features
of the benzotriazole methodology for the last 10 years. We have successfully
employed the BtRC approach for the synthesis of benzoxazoles, benzothiazoles,
and amide derivatives mainly using free radical pathway.2 We also presented an improved approach for the
synthesis of benzothiazoles via intramolecular cyclative cleavage
of the benzotriazole ring of N-thioacylbenzotriazoles
by using 2.2 equiv of nBu3SnH
along with 5 mol % azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN), which was further
improved by our group in another report using 0.6 equiv of nBu3SnH along with excess of NaBH4 and 5 mol % AIBN (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Previous and Present Work from Our Lab on BtRC
Nowadays, one of the crucial
challenges in front of organic synthetic
chemists is to innovate and modify the established processes by removal
of hazardous substances, reducing the waste product, re-use of industrial
waste, and conservation of energy in the reaction in such a way that
it benefits the human being, environment, and economy.6 Thus, for the past 2 decades research on green chemistry,
especially green organic synthesis, is considered as one of the most
promising areas, where further utilization of industrial waste materials
is the main goal. Polymethylhydrosiloxane (PMHS), a polymer with the
general structure −(CH3(H)Si–O)– is
a silicon industry byproduct (Figure 1).7 PMHS is inexpensive
(cost is almost ∼1.0 dollar per kilogram), stable to air, moisture,
and in organic solvents, having low viscosity, and moreover it is
a biodegradable and nontoxic reagent.7a Therefore, this reagent may be considered as a green alternative
reagent for wide applications in organic synthesis.7−22 For example, PMHS has been successfully used for the chemoselective
reductive amination of a variety of carbonyl compounds8 and also asymmetric hydrosilylation of heteroaromatic ketones.9 In addition, PMHS has also been utilized for
the reduction of other systems including ketone to alkane,10 tert amide to amine,11 alkyne to alkene,12 aromatic/aliphatic
nitro groups to respective amines,13 aromatic
acid chlorides to respective aldehydes,14 and indole to indoline.15 Interestingly,
chemoselective16 and enantioselective conjugate
reduction17 has also been achieved successfully
using this silicon industry waste reagent. Furthermore, hydrocarbonylative
C–C coupling of terminal alkynes with alkyl iodide (RI),18 and anti-Markovnikov hydroallylation with functionalized
alkynes were well investigated using PMHS.19 Although, PMHS was well utilized for the synthesis of benzothiazole
and the related heterocycle,20 and also
for the selective cleavage of allyl ethers, amines, and esters.21 However, this reagent is little explored for
the purpose of ring opening reaction in order to afford biologically
relevant molecules.2f,22

(PMHS), a cheap, stable,
nontoxic, and biodegradable industrial waste.

In the present work, we wish to report a modified BtRC protocol
for the synthesis of diverse benzothiazoles comprising an improved
green approach under the free radical condition by the use of a silicon
industry waste product PMHS in place of n-Bu3SnH.

Results and Discussion
Our synthetic
strategy begins with the preparation of benzotriazole
methanethione derivatives, which were obtained from corresponding
thiols or secondary amines or alcohols by treating them with bis-benzotriazole methanethione under the standard reaction
condition (see the Supporting Information, Scheme S1).2a,2b For establishment of PMHS as
a competent alternative of n-Bu3SnH for
BtRC, we set up a prototype reaction with 1.0 equiv of 4-chlorophenyl-1H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole-1-carbodithioate 1a and 1.1 equiv of PMHS by weight in the presence of 5 mol
% of AIBN in anhydrous toluene at 90 °C for 5 h (Scheme 2). The reaction mass was concentrated
under reduced pressure and the reaction product 2a was
purified through column chromatography (SiO2). A 69% yield
of the desired product 2a was obtained, which suggested
that PMHS can efficiently cleave the benzotriazole ring.

Scheme 2 Prototype
BtRC Reaction for the Synthesis of Benzothiazole 2a
After establishment of PMHS
as a suitable reagent for BtRC, we
tried to find out the optimum reaction conditions for the high product
yields with minimum use of a reagent. In this respect, solvent, reaction
time, and reaction temperature were optimized to get the best reaction
yield with great ease. First of all, optimization of the solvent including
toluene, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF),
tetrahydrofuran (THF), and benzene was considered independently, which
revealed that anhydrous THF is the best suited solvent for the BtRC
reaction (Table 1,
entry 5). To our pleasant surprise, the cleavage reaction also went
smoothly and satisfactorily in neat condition, that is the solvent-free
condition producing respective benzothiazole 2a in excellent
yield (Table 1, entry
6). After optimization of the reaction medium, we investigated the
loading of AIBN and found that reaction produces a maximum yield with
5 mol % loading of AIBN (Table 1, entry 6), whereas average yields were obtained when the
reaction was carried out in the absence of AIBN (Table 1, entries 8 and 9). We also
optimized the reaction temperature and found that lowering of the
temperature reduced the product yields drastically and at room temperature
the reaction did not move at all. At a temperature above 120 °C,
the reaction goes around 80% with a number of side products. The most
favorable condition for the reaction was found to be entry no. 6 of Table 1.

After optimization of the reaction conditions with
reactant 1a, we further tried to generalize the use of
PMHS in BtRC
of a variety of thioacyl benzotriazoles (1b-t). We successfully
developed various types of arylthio-thioacyl benzotriazoles including N-(ferrocenylmethyl)-N′-dialkylthiocarbamoyl
benzotriazole, N,N′-dialkylthiocarbamoyl
benzotriazole, and carbohydrate-based benzotriazole methanethione
derivatives (1b-t) following the procedures given in
literature.2a,2b When we carried out BtRC of aryl-thio-thioacyl
benzotriazole derivatives 1b & 1c with
PMHS under the optimized reaction conditions (i.e., Table 1, entry no. 6), it was found
that 1b & 1c undergo complete conversion
on thin layer chromatography (TLC) and give up to 98% yield after
purification by column chromatography, but N,N′-dialkylthiocarbamoyl benzotriazole (1d-m), N-(ferrocenylmethyl)-N′-dialkylthiocarbamoyl
benzotriazole (1n-q), and carbohydrate-based benzotriazole
methanethione derivatives (1r-t) give moderate to good
yields of respective benzothiazole (2b-t) in pure form
after purification by column chromatography (SiO2). A result
of BtRC chemistry using PMHS is depicted in Table 2.

a Molar ratios: 1a–t (1.0 equiv), PMHS

For the quantitative
generalization of the above-established BtRC
reaction with PMHS, we applied the optimized reaction in gram scales
and found that PMHS works equally well as a solvent and a reagent
in the grams scale synthesis of benzothiazole 2a via
the BtRC route (Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 PMHS-Mediated BtRC Executed in the Gram Scale
Mechanism of the PMHS-mediated BtRC is envisaged
to follow the
similar cleavage chemistry reported earlier by utilizing tributyl
tin hydride (Bu3SnH)2a or TMS-H2b under free radical condition, where the ring
opening of thioacyl benzotriazole 1 occurs via β-scission of
N–N bond followed by ring closure through the elimination of
molecular nitrogen (N2), thus resulting in the respective
benzothiazole heterocyclic skeleton 2 (Scheme 4). Our previous investigation based on Density
Functional Theory (DFT) calculation using Pople basis sets 6-31G (d,p)
is further supported to predict Si–S bonding strength (in TMS-H)
and it also supports the existence of intermediate radical I (in PMHS)
that we have postulated in our present mechanistic pathway.2b Likewise, AIBN commences the BtRC route by generating
the 2-cyanoprop-2-yl radical, which quickly reacts with PMHS and results
in a PMS radical (PMS•).23 This radical first attacks the thione group of RCSBt 1 and generates similar type of radical intermediates I and II, which, on benzotriazole ring opening, gives
biradical intermediate III followed by elimination of
molecular nitrogen and consequent attack of sulphur (resulted in the
respective intermediates IV and V) followed
by oxidative aromatization at the cost of the 2σ-bond, resulting
in a π-bond in the respective benzothiazole 2.
In the support of the free radical mechanism, we also added TEMPO
(a well-known free radical inhibitor) in the optimized reaction, which
resulted in only 14% product yield, which clearly suggests that free
radical formation has taken place during the course of reaction.24 The plausible mechanism for the PMHS-mediated
BtRC of N-thioacyl benzotriazole 1 leading
to the respective benzothiazole 2 is depicted in Scheme 4.

for PMHS-Mediated BtRC Leading to Benzothiazole 2
Conclusions
In
brief, we have established industrial waste PMHS (PMHS) as an
efficient reagent for the BtRC of N-thioacyl benzotriazoles
for easy access of benzothiazole derivatives. Furthermore, this reagent
is a cheap and waste product of the silicone industry, which works
equally well even in neat conditions, making this BtRC protocol a
cost-effective, nontoxic, and more applicable and greener than previous
investigated methods.

Experimental Section
General Remarks
The starting materials were synthesized
by using standard known procedures. The commercially available Merck
and Sigma-Aldrich solvents and reagents were used as such without
further purification. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra
were recorded at 500 and 125 MHz in a spectrometer, respectively.
The reactions were performed in sealed tubes under optimized conditions.
After the completion of the reaction on TLC, which was visualized
by observing it in a UV chamber (λmax = 254 nm),
organic scaffolds were purified by flash column chromatography (SiO2).

General Experimental Procedure for the Synthesis
of Benzothiazole
Scaffolds 2a–2t
Benzotriazole methanethione
derivative 1 (1.0 mmol) was taken with AIBN (5–10
mol %) and the PMHS reagent as well as a solvent, and the resulting
reaction mixture was stirred at 110 °C for about 5–6 h.
After the completion of the reaction (the progress of the reaction
was monitored by TLC), the crude solution was subjected to reduced
pressure using a rotary evaporator to obtain the crude mass. Furthermore,
the crude residues were purified by flash column chromatography (SiO2) using the gradient of ethyl acetate/n-hexane
(2–30%) to obtain the corresponding benzothiazole moieties
(2a–2t).
