In
this paper, we demonstrate the formation of hybrid nanostructures
consisting of two distinctive components mainly in a one-to-one ratio.
Thermolysis of inorganic nanotubes (INT) and closed-cage, inorganic
fullerene-like (IF) nanoparticles decorated with a dense coating of
metallic nanoparticles (M = Au, Ag, Pd) results in migration of relatively
small NPs or surface-enhanced diffusion of atoms or clusters, generating
larger particles (ripening). AuNP growth on the surface of INTs has
been captured in real time using in situ electron microscopy measurements.
Reaction of the AuNP-decorated INTs with an alkylthiol results in
a chemically induced NP fusion process at room temperature. The NPs
do not dissociate from the surfaces of the INTs and IFs, but for proximate
IFs we observed fusion between AuNPs originating from different IFs.

Introduction
The generation of hybrid
nano- and micromaterials consisting of
structurally different components to acquire new functionalities is
a tremendous challenge. The diversity of possible hybrid nano- and
micromaterials and their potential applications are countless.1,2 Nanomaterials have been developed into real-world applications and
are commercialized (i.e., carbon- and metal-based materials).3−5 As an example, MS2-based inorganic nanotubes (INT) and
closed-cage, inorganic fullerene-like (IF) nanoparticles were discovered
about 25 years ago and are nowadays produced on a large-scale, enabling
their use in diverse applications.6−8 Large efforts are being
devoted to engineer structurally well-defined hybrid nano- and micromaterials
that fulfill the many requirements needed to find competitive applications.9−11 The predesign of such hybrid materials and their properties using
bottom-up synthetic approaches requires a large knowledge base, which
is rapidly expanding because of the increasing number of excellent
fundamental studies.

We have introduced recently an efficient
one-step method for coating
INT and IF nanoparticles of WS2 and MoS2 respectively,
by uniform monolayers of monodispersed metallic nanoparticles (MNPs;
M = Au, Ag, Pd).12 Formation of multiple
sulfur–metal coordination bonds and lattice matching between
the surfaces of these two-dimensional nanomaterials composed of transition-metal
chalcogenides (MS2; M = W or Mo) and the MNPs are the driving
forces for the formation of the homogenous coatings (Scheme 1). In contrast to previous
studies,13 where decoration of the INT
by MNP was defect-driven and hence nonuniform, the decoration of the
nanotubes is chemically driven and hence highly uniform and controllable.
The interaction between the NPs of group 11 elements and the INT/IF
results in narrowing of the optical band gap of INT/IF, increased
work function, and improved surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS).
These hybrid materials can be further functionalized by the introduction
of fluorescent and structurally well-defined metal complexes, and
their solubility can be significantly enhanced by tetraoctylammonium
bromide (TOAB)-capping layer exchange with alkyl thiols. Furthermore,
we have shown that the surface-bound AuNPs can be cross-linked with
chromophores (metal complexes or porphyrins) having pyridine binding
sites. Subsequent oxidative removal of the inner INT with hydrogen
peroxide resulted in the formation of freestanding tubular assemblies
consisting of a nanoparticle–molecular network. The overall
structure of these single-walled tubular assemblies resemble that
of the inorganic template.14

Rendering Showing the Homogeneous Decoration of the Surfaces
of INT-WS2 and IF-MoS2 with MNPs (M = Au, Ag, Pd)12 Followed by Thermolysis or Chemically Induced Ripening
of the MNPs on the Surfaces of the Inorganic Structures
In this paper, we demonstrate
that the decorated MNP/INT-WS2 (M = Au, Ag, Pd) and AuNP/IF-MoS2 can undergo thermally and chemically induced
processes leading to on-surface NP growth. This NP-growth process
occurs on the outer surfaces of the inorganic structures. The thermolysis
of MNP/INT-WS2 results in the
formation of unique hybrid nanomaterials consisting predominantly
of a single relatively large NP per INT-WS2. Both in situ and ex situ monitoring of this process
for AuNP/INT-WS2 by scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) captures the growth of the AuNPs on the
surface of INT-WS2. These experiments
indicate the formation of a crystalline structure by on-surface particle
diffusion. The lability of the surface-bound monolayer of AuNPs is
further demonstrated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) by “shaving”
the AuNP-monolayer from the surface of the INT-WS2.

Results and Discussion
Physical
attachment of TOAB-capped MNPs (M = Au, Ag, Pd) of various
diameters (⌀ AuNP = 5 nm; ⌀ AgNP = 17 nm; ⌀ PdNP
= 2 nm) onto the outer surface of INT-WS2 and IF-MoS2 was achieved
using our previously reported synthetic route (Scheme 1; inorganic decoration).12 For example, adding a dispersion of TOAB-coated AuNPs in
toluene (600 μL, 2.67 mg/mL) to a dispersion of INT-WS2 in toluene (1.0 mL, 0.4 mg) resulted in
the quantitative formation of the desired AuNP/INT-WS2. SEM and transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) confirmed the formation of uniform coatings of a monolayer of
NPs. Representative SEM images of the MNP-decorated INT-WS2 and IF-MoS2 are shown in Figure 1. The average NP spacing of the dense coatings is ∼2
nm. Tilt series of high-resolution scanning transmission electron
microscopy (STEM) high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) images of AuNP/INT-WS2 confirm the monolayer
structure of the nanoparticle coating (Figure 2). Freshly prepared materials were used to
demonstrate the on-surface fusion of the NPs.

cut planes through the nanotube. The scale bars are 50 nm.

The AuNP/INT-WS2 was drop-casted
on a preheated (150 °C) silicon substrate using a hot plate.
SEM measurements showed the formation of new hybrid materials after
3 h of continuous heating in air, consisting of a relatively large
AuNP near an end of the INT-WS2 (Figure 3a). The
one-to-one relationship and the absence of free AuNPs indicate a mechanism
in which the AuNPs remain bound to the surface of the INT-WS2 during thermolysis. High-resolution SEM
images of an individual AuNP/INT-WS2 after heating unambiguously show the formation of crystalline
AuNPs. Examples of AuNPs having a decahedron structure are shown in Figure 3b,c.15 The radius of these AuNPs ranges from 20 to 40 nm. Ex situ
monitoring of the thermolysis of AuNP/INT-WS2 by SEM at different reaction times (0–180 min)
captures the growth of smaller AuNPs into increasingly larger ones
randomly distributed on the INT-WS2 (Figure 3d–g).
This process culminated in formation of one single crystalline structure
(Figure 3h).

images taken at different stages of the thermolysis process. (i) Raman
spectra taken at different stages of the thermolysis process. The
inset shows an exponential increase of the diameter of the AuNPs during
heating (R2 = 0.98).

We also monitored the thermolysis of AuNP/INT-WS2 by ex situ Raman spectroscopy showing the
gradual
disappearance of the SERS peaks (Figure 3i). The signal intensity of the characteristic
bands at ν = 353 cm–1 (E2g) and
ν = 421 cm–1 (A1g) of INT-WS2 decreases concurrently with the decreasing
number of AuNPs. The position of these bands and the ratios of their
intensities remain constant indicating that the structure of the INT-WS2 is not affected.16

Thermolysis of AuNP/IF-MoS2 (Figure 1b) was carried
out using similar reaction conditions as for AuNP/INT-WS2. SEM images of the thermodynamic products
show again the formation of AuNP-nanodecahedrons (Figure 4). The close proximity of the IF-MoS2 resulted in inter-IF fusing
of these AuNPs after 3 h (Figure 4b). The AuNPs continue to grow as judged from the SEM
images recorded after 24 h reaction time, suggesting some mobility
of the new crystalline Au structures between the IFs (Figure 4c), although they remain bound
to the MoS2 surface (Figure 4d).

h. (d) TEM image showing a crystalline AuNP-nanodecahedron attached

SEM images recorded after the
thermolysis of AgNP/INT-WS2 and PdNP/INT-WS2 also show the disappearance
of the dense NP coatings
of monodispersed MNPs and the generation of new materials consisting
of a relatively large single NP attached to the surface of the INT-WS2 (Figure 5). Apparently, there is no transfer of the
new MNPs between the INT-WS2.
No free NPs were observed, indicating that the NP-growth occurs exclusively
on the surface of the INT-WS2.

To gain further insight into the AuNP growth, we monitored
in situ
the thermolysis of AuNP/INT-WS2 by SEM under high vacuum (10–5 mbar). A movie
and real-time images showing this thermolysis process at 150 °C
are provided in the Supporting Information (Movie S1 and Figure S1). Although we applied
the same temperature as for the thermolysis of AuNP/INT-WS2 in air, the reaction under vacuum is ∼7.5×
faster and was completed in 24 min. Energy transfer from the electron
beam may lead to additional activation. It is likely that the TOAB-capping
layer of the AuNPs is further destabilized under these conditions,
thus facilitating surface-enhanced diffusion. The movie unambiguously
shows the growth of the NPs on the surface of the INT-WS2.

We have previously reported that
reaction of AuNP/INT-WS2 with
an alkylthiol results in the TOAB-alkylthiol-capping
layer exchange.12 The exchange did not
affect the structure of the AuNP monolayer. The hydrophobic coating
enhances the solubility of the hybrid INT in organic solvents. We
found here conditions that induce the fusion of the surface-bound
AuNPs in toluene at room temperature by using 11-mercaptoundecanoic
acid and AuNP/INT-WS2. TEM and
SEM images obtained after ∼6 h reaction time show that a monolayer
of the relatively small AuNPs has been transformed into many larger
AuNPs attached to the INT-WS2, that is, ripening (Figure 6). This chemically induced AuNP fusion at room temperature
can be a result of competing Au–S interactions between the
thiol groups of the 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid and those of the INT-WS2 surface. Weakening the binding
of the AuNPs to the surface of the INT-WS2 by reducing the number of Au–S interactions will enhance
their mobility and fusion. Under the applied reaction conditions,
no free AuNPs were observed, rendering a dissociation–association
route unlikely in this reaction as well.

Figure 6 Chemical-induced fusion
of AuNPs. SEM (a,b) and TEM (c) images
after reacting AuNP/INT-WS2 with
11-mercaptoundecanoic acid in toluene at room temperature.

We attempted to measure the heat dissipation of
the AuNP/INT-WS2 and INT-WS2 using AFM. The scanning thermal microscope
is capable of measuring
temperature differences on the order of 1 K, but no difference in
the heat dissipation was observed between the AuNP-decorated and native
nanotubes. This null result was likely due to the fact that the AuNPs
were mechanically removed from the surface of INT-WS2 by the thermal scan process. Indeed, SEM micrographs
of the samples scanned by AFM revealed that the AuNPs had been selectively
removed from the scanned regions (Figure 7). This measurement provides supporting evidence
for the mobility of the AuNPs on the INT. A previous study of the
interaction between AuNPs and INT-WS2 found that a normal force of ∼60 nN was required to
move the AuNPs along the defect-free INT-WS2 surface.13 In those studies,
the AuNPs subsequently became stuck on edge defects at the INT cap,
where the binding force was much stronger, on the order of a chemical
bond. However, those measurements were made with the AFM probe in
contact, leading to substantial shear force. Here, only intermittent
contact was made in the semicontact mode. Analytical expressions can
be used to estimate both the average and peak forces applied per cycle.17 Presuming a radial modulus of 4 GPa for the
nanotube,18,19 a tip radius of 50 nm, and the measured
modulation amplitude of 150 nm, we estimate average forces of ∼1
nN and peak forces of ∼400 nN. Further studies, using different
conditions, could reveal the minimum force required for the AuNP displacement.
Overall, the results observed here are in good agreement with mobility
of AuNPs on the surface of the INT-WS2.

Concluding Remarks
Unique nanostructures have been demonstrated
consisting of two
distinctive structures mainly in a one-to-one ratio. In situ electron
microscopy provided valuable fundamental information, as it has done
in the past for phase transformation and recrystallization processes
for other inorganic materials.20,21 Growth of metallic
particles on various surfaces from smaller particles can occur through
different mechanisms, including vapor-phase diffusion (Ostwald ripening)
or/and substrate-surface diffusion of smaller particles or atoms to
generate larger structures.22−27 A vapor-phase diffusion process is not likely to occur under the
experimental conditions in air at 150 °C. We have shown that
destabilizing the capping layer by adding alkyl thiol results in nanoparticle
fusion at room temperature (Figure 6). In our study, migration of metallic particles (atoms
and clusters thereof) and subsequent coalescence is likely the dominant
mechanistic pathway. This mechanism could be considered as a modified
Volmer–Weber 3D island growth, facilitated by several factors:
(i) a low interfacial energy between AuNPs and INT-WS2, (ii) small contact area of AuNPs on the
nanotube due to faceting, and (iii) favorable energy of formation
of the Au nanocrystal. The fact that the final crystalline shape is
similar in all cases supports the hypothesis of weak interaction with
the surface. The movement of the gold atoms and clusters on the surface
of INT-WS2 has to proceed with
both breaking and forming of Au–S bonds, making the overall
process likely to be thermodynamically neutral. Large NPs/clusters
have more Au–S interactions and are expected to be less mobile.
The Au–S bond is 40–50 kcal/mol and expected to break
upon heating as is well-known for alkylthiol-based monolayers on Au
substrates.28 This proposed particle-migration
mechanism is in agreement with, for example, the thermal-induced fusion
of AuNPs on GaN nanowires.22 The mobility
is remarkable as the lengths of some of the used INT-WS2 are orders of magnitudes larger than those
of the initial MNPs. No dissociation–association pathway of
the NPs is apparent. However, we did observe that the use of closely
packed IFs resulted in fusion of the AuNPs from different IFs, indicating
that cross-over pathways are accessible. Because the feedstock of
the final MNPs during the thermolysis processes is the smaller MNPs
bound to the same INT-WS2, the
size of the final MNP should reflect the dimensions of the supporting
inorganic nanostructures. Shape control and uniformity of NPs and
related nanostructures are highly sought after.29−35 The use of homogeneous inorganic nano- and microstructures as the
template can result in a new approach to generate metallic structures
with a high uniformity and useful mechanical properties.14,36

Experimental Section
Materials and Methods
INT-WS2 was supplied by NanoMaterials Ltd, Israel.
The length
and diameter of the INT-WS2 are
in the range 1–20 μm to 30–100 nm, respectively.
TOAB-coated AuNPs (⌀ AuNP = 5 nm),37,38 AgNPs (⌀ AgNP = 17 nm),39 and
PdNPs (⌀ AuNP = 2 nm)40 were prepared
according to published procedures. NaAuCl4·2H2O, AgCl, and PdCl2 were purchased from Alfa Aesar.
Sodium citrate monobasic and sodium borohydride were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich. 11-Mercaptoundecanoic acid was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
TOAB was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (98%) and from Chem-Impex International
(99.4%) and was used as received. Decoration of the NPs onto the outer
surface of INT-WS2 and IF-MoS2 was achieved using our previously
reported method.12

TEM images were
obtained with a JEM 2100 (HT) TEM (JEOL) system operating at an accelerating
voltage of 200 kV and equipped with a Gatan UltraScan 1000 CCD camera.
SEM images were collected with an Ultra 55 FEG (Zeiss). UV–vis
spectra were obtained by using Varian Cary 100 spectrophotometers
(in double beam transmission mode). Absorption data were obtained
by scatter-free absorbance spectra collected on a CLARiTY 1000 spectrophotometer
(Bogart, GA, USA). Raman spectra were obtained with a Renishaw micro
Raman imaging microscope with a 632.8 nm He–Ne laser. The laser
power was 25 mW with a 10× objective used for focusing. The acquisition
time was 10 s. The samples were drop-casted on a silicon wafer. Individual
nanotubes were placed at 45° with respect to the XY plane.

Electron Tomography
Tilt series of high-resolution
STEM HAADF images were acquired on an FEI F20 TWIN electron microscope.
The tilt increment was 2° in a range of 132°. Tomograms
were reconstructed using the iterative simultaneous reconstruction
technique, after cross-correlation alignment and iterative feedback
displacement refinement.41,42 MeVisLab was used for
the visualization of tomogram data.

AFM measurements were performed
using an NTEGRA AFM with Smena head (NT-MDT, Zelenograd). A module
for performing scanning thermal microscopy—VertiSense (App
Nano, Mt. View, CA) was applied to investigate the thermal properties
of decorated and uncoated nanotubes. VTP-200 probes, with nominal
spring constant of 10 N/m, were used in the semicontact mode. The
module was operated in the heat dissipation mode, where the laser
alignment on the probe was adjusted to heat the tip to approximately
20 K above room temperature, so that mappings of heat dissipation
could be obtained simultaneously with the topography. SEM micrographs
were made of the sample before and after imaging the nanotubes by
AFM.

Thermolysis of MNP/INT-WS2 (M = Au, Ag, Pd) and AuNP/IF-MoS2 on a Si[100] Wafer in Air
A dispersion of MNP/INT-WS2 (M = Au, Ag, Pd) or AuNP/IF-MoS2 (20 μL, toluene, 0.13
mg/mL) is drop-casted on a Si[100] substrate (0.2 cm × 0.2 cm),
and excess of solvent is removed using Kim wipe. Then, the substrate
is transferred to a preheated hot plate (150 °C) and heated for
3 h (AuNP/INT-WS2), 5 h (AgNP/INT-WS2), 4 h (PdNP/INT-WS2), and 3 h (AuNP/IF-MoS2).

In Situ Monitoring the Thermolysis of AuNP/INT-WS2 by SEM on a Cu Substrate under
Vacuum
A dispersion of AuNP/INT-WS2 (20 μL, toluene, 0.13 mg/mL) is drop-casted
on a copper substrate,
and excess of solvent is removed using Kim wipe. The Cu substrate
is placed in an XL30 ESEM-FEG (FEI) and is heated to 150 °C using
a heating stage (Kammrath and Weiss 800 °C heating module) under
high vacuum mode (10–5 mbar). The fusion of the
AuNPs to form Au-nanostructures occurs within 24 min. Images were
captured using 1 frame/s, and a movie was generated by stacking these
images.

Reaction of AuNP/INT-WS2 with 11-Mercaptoundecanoic Acid
A dispersion of AuNPs (600
μL, toluene, 2.67 mg/mL) was added to a dispersion of INT-WS2 (1.0 mL, toluene, 0.4 mg). AuNP/INT-WS2 slowly precipitated as
judged by absolute spectroscopy. Subsequently, 11-mercaptoundecanoic
acid (200 μL, toluene, 7.14 mg/mL) was added after 2 h, and
the reaction mixture was analyzed by absolute spectroscopy. The materials
were analyzed by SEM and TEM after 6 h to confirm that the treatment
with the thiol did not result in the release of the AuNPs.

Mechanical
Removal of AuNPs from AuNP/INT-WS2 by AFM
A dispersion of AuNP/INT-WS2 (0.4 mg, 200 μL water/toluene 3:1,
v/v) was drop-casted on a silicon substrate and dried under a gentle
flow of air. The sample was analyzed by low magnification SEM, followed
by AFM measurements, after which the SEM was applied again to observe
changes in the scanned hybrid nanostructures.
