Quantitative
monitoring of brain neurochemistry is aimed at an
accurate measurement of chemical basal levels and dynamics defining
neuronal activities. Analytical tools must be endowed with high selectivity,
sensitivity, and spatiotemporal resolution to tackle this task. On
one hand, in vivo electroanalysis combined with miniature electrodes
has evolved into a minimally invasive method for probing transient
events during neural communication and metabolism. On the other hand,
noninvasive imaging techniques have been widely adopted in visualizing
the neural structure and processes within a population of neurons
in two or three dimensions. This perspective will give a concise review
of the inspiring frontiers at the interface of neurochemistry and
electrochemistry (microvoltammetry, nanoamperometry, galvanic redox
potentiometry and ion transport-based sensing) or imaging (super-resolution
single nanotube tracking, deep multiphoton microscopy, and free animal
imaging). Potential opportunities with these methods and their combinations
for multimodal brain analysis will be discussed, intending to draw
a brief picture for future neuroscience research.

1 Introduction
Brain function or dysfunction
shapes our lives through the essential
neurotransmission or synaptic transmission process, which is a comprehensive
outcome of an interactive, dynamic network of neurochemicals. Establishing
a quantitative linkage between neurochemistry and activities of neurons,
circuits, intact brain and even the whole living biosystems is the
holy grail in neuroscience at the molecular scale. Generally, strategies
for building the connection can be invasive and noninvasive analysis,
depending on how the neural samples and analytical units/probes are
incorporated, of a broad range of chemicals in the brain: ions (H+, Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, etc.), gases (O2, H2S, NO, etc.), reactive
oxygen species, neurotransmitters [dopamine (DA), serotonin, epinephrine,
nonepinephrine, glutamate, acetocholine, etc.], neuromodulators (e.g.,
ascorbate), energy suppliers (glucose, lactate, pyruvate, ATP, etc.),
cell metabolites, peptides, proteins, and nucleic acids. Quite different
from widely understood analytical chemistry, this so-called in vivo
analysis faces much more challenges in endowing methods with enough
selectivity, sensitivity, spatiotemporal resolution, reliability,
and neuron compatibility to adapt to the unique complexity of chemical
environment in the brain. In the past half century, we have witnessed
a fast expansion of this topic into a multidisciplinary field that
involves knowledge and techniques of electrochemistry, optical imaging,
mass spectrometry, magnetic resonance imaging, and online sampling,
and so forth. However, rather than giving a full coverage of all the
progress in the field, we are restricted to latest inspiring and prospective
research on in vivo quantitation of brain neurochemistry, with a particular
focus on electrochemical and imaging approaches.

The task of
in vivo quantitation is measuring the basal levels
or dynamics of neurochemicals at various neural dimensions, such as
single vesicles, neurons, brain regions, neural circuits, brain slices,
and intact brains in living animals or humans. This was achieved by
time- and labor-consuming tissue/cell sampling, separation, and analysis
in early stages, and limitations were the spatiotemporal gaps between
the real chemical events in vivo and analytical outputs ex vivo. One
solution is the on-line microdialysis-sensing system based on miniaturized
push–pull perfusion sampling.1,2 Another important
direction is the development of the on-site analytical platform for
real-time monitoring of neurochemicals in living biosystems. It is
typically performed in conditions as close to the real states of biosystems
as possible, aiming at extracting accurate and quantitative molecular
information encoded in vivo. To achieve this goal, minimally invasive
or noninvasive methods applied to unrestricted living entities have
emerged in two major intriguing trends: in vivo electroanalysis and
imaging. A concise review of frontiers in these aspects will be made
in the present perspective. Our purpose is to draw a blueprint for
future interdisciplinary collaboration on molecular interpretation
of the brain.

2 In Vivo Electroanalysis
2.1 Fast-Scan Cyclic Voltammetry
The
history of in vivo electroanalysis was started by Adams and colleagues’
pioneering endeavor on microvoltammetry in the late 1970s. Using an
implanted micro-carbon paste electrode, they monitored the levels
of catecholamine transmitters in the cerebrospinal fluid in an electrically
or chemically stimulated rat brain.3 This
is a milestone in brain neurochemistry as neurotransmission can be
directly, continuously, and quickly quantitated. Electroactive substances
are electrolyzed at the biased electrode surface to yield faradaic
current as the quantitative indicator of concentration. Then the question
was asked: how could we clarify identities of coexisting chemical
constituents producing currents? The answer was later given by Wightman
and colleagues, who reported the breakthrough attempt of in vivo fast
scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) combined with pyrolytic carbon fiber
electrode (CFE4) in selective monitoring
of fast striatal DA release.5 The unique
advantage of FSCV over ordinary microvoltammetry is the strong resolving
power at high potential sweeping speed without gaining large charging
background under the aid of CFE. In a subsecond scan, neurochemicals
(such as DA and ascorbic acid) undergoing distinguishable electrode
kinetics can be resolved to distinct current peaks. Therefore, FSCV
is not only useful for selective measurement of neurochemicals of
interest but also well-suited for concurrent multicomponent analysis.

FSCV over three decades has advanced from the initial trial on
anaesthetized rats into a reliable technique for acute and chronic
measurements in freely behaving animals.6 Being a differential method, FSCV is incapable of determining basal
level, while favoring monitoring fluctuations of biogenic amines.7 Thus, sensitivity is crucial for capturing catecholamine
transients (below micro molars). A great deal of efforts have been
devoted into background subtraction and chemometric data analysis,
attempting to dig out signals overwhelmed by nonFaradaic currents,
interferences, and noises.6 In spite of
these, Tybrandt et al. described an interesting combination of FSCV
and organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) that took advantage
of the field effect to amplify FSCV signals and reduce electrical
noises. An OECT chip was fabricated to consist of micropatterned gold
electrodes as gate electrodes, source, and drain terminals and a microchannel
made of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS).
The FSCV measurement was conducted by applying the scanning potential
to one gate electrode, at which DA was oxidized. The resulting ionic
current caused consequential drain current change by modulating the
Na+ doping level of the PEDOT:PSS film thought the electrolyte
in the channel (Figure 1).8 Transient measurement of DA concentration
down to a few micromoles endowed this hybrid sensing platform with
a merely comparable performance in line with the state-of-the-art
FSCV equipment, although it has not been tested for implanted applications.
Nevertheless, OECT represents a new opportunity for development of
in vivo FSCV.

FSCV.

electrode subjected to FSCV, and doping level of the PEDOT:PSS film
changes with the resulting ionic current. (b) FSCVs of DA oxidation

2.2 Nanoamperometry
Different from CV,
amperometry monitors chemical dynamics in the sense of current transients
at a constantly held potential. Not relying on the scanning potential
waveform to gain resolving power, amperometric sensors require a specifically
designed electrode surface/interface to solely permit electrochemical
reactions of target molecules according to their intrinsic redox properties.
For instance, CFEs are modified with particularly treated carbon nanotubes
(CNTs) for selective in vivo amperometric monitoring of ascorbic acid.9 Because of the ultrasensitivity and ultrafast
response speed, amperometry can be performed at very small current
scale of a few nanoampere or even picoampere and time scale of millisecond
or microsecond. From this perspective it is an attractive tool for
probing transient chemical events like exocytosis during synaptic
transmission, and in fact Wightman and colleagues gave the early picture
of how it worked with chromaffin cells in 1991.10 As termed single-cell amperometry, it typically requires
a working CFE positioned close to or in contact with the membrane
of individual cell with a reference electrode in solution. Neurotransmitters
released into the extracellular space (ECS) from single vesicle are
quickly oxidized at the biased sensing probe and produce an anodic
current spike. Because the sensing interface and potential are tunable
for desired selectivity, we can assess types of neurochemicals packed
in a vesicle. A number of vesicular catecholamines like DA, serotonin,
epinephrine, and norepinephrine have been verified. Most recently,
quantum release of ascorbate from single rat adrenal chromaffin cell
upon K+ stimulation was confirmed and analyzed by an electrochemically
treated CFE at +0.0 V versus Ag/AgCl (Figure 2a), providing the first quantitative description
of endogenous ascorbate secretion.11 Number
of neurotransmitters during each quantum release is quantitated by
the integral charge of corresponding spike, shape of which also provides
useful information about release kinetics.12 For example, in measuring serotonin discharge from single synaptic
vesicles of neurons Bruns and Jahn characterized two types of vesicles
in terms of release amount and time: small clear vesicles discharging
∼4700 molecules within 260 μs and large dense core vesicles
discharging ∼80 000 molecules within 1.3 ms.13 By means of single-cell amperometry, Ewing,
Amatore, and their co-workers have identified a new partial release
mode of exocytosis. As they observed, a small prespike current increase
(“prefoot”) and postspike current decrease (“postfoot”)
indicated slower neurotransmitter diffusion during opening and closing
of the vesicle fusion pore. In some amperometric events, spikes were
small and short in pore duration, implying a third “kiss-and-run”
exocytosis mode. Unlike the widely accepted “all-or-nothing”
full release process, neurotransmission through a partial release
mechanism appears to be more modulable, because many factors including
lipid composition and membrane proteins may affect the pore opening
and closing rate or size and thus release kinetics.14−17 A further step of nanoamperometry
into the synaptic cleft (about 20 nm apart) can be realized by nanoelectrodes.
By flame etching, Huang, and co-workers fabricated a CFE with a cone-shaped
nanotip of 50–200 nm in diameter and 500–2000 nm in
length (Figure 2b–e).
Quantal norepinephrine spikes were recorded by the nanoCFE inside
synapses following high K+ stimulation, over 50% of them
featuring complex release sequence that may be explained by the “kiss-and-run”
mechanism.18

In order to find more quantitative
proof for the partial release
model, it is necessary to determine the neurotransmitter amount in
vesicles before membrane fusion. Ewing and co-workers showed that
single adrenal chromaffin vesicles underwent absorbing onto a microsized
carbon disk electrode, sliding over the electrode surface and then
membrane rupture to release entire catecholamine content trapped and
oxidized by the electrode. This demonstrated the possibility of counting
molecules in vesicles by stochastic collisions.19 On the basis of this principle, they established a novel
amperometric method termed intracellular vesicle impact electrochemical
cytometry (VIEC). In one way, the flame-etched CF nanotip was carefully
pushed into the cytoplasmic space without damaging the PC12 cell membrane.
Once collided the electrode surface vesicles went through absorbing–sliding–opening
to result in a full release of chemical content, 114 500 ±
15 300 molecules. In the other way, the nanotip was placed
in contact with the cell membrane to record exocytosis signals upon
K+ stimulation and measured released amount, 73 200
± 5820 molecules. Approximately 64% of vesicular catecholamine
neurotransmitters were secreted in single exocytosis events, in good
agreement with the open/close mechanism (Figure 3).20 This study
also demonstrates that combination of single-cell amperometry and
VIEC makes a powerful tool for understanding the dynamic mass transport
between cytoplasm and ECS in a real-time manner.

2.3 Galvanic Redox Potentiometry
Compared
to voltammetric or amperometric methods, potentiometric methods measure
analyte concentration by the interfacial potential difference. Under
equilibrium circumstances (zero net current) according to the Nernst
equation, the open-circuit potential (OCP) of the indicating electrode
with respect to the reference electrode is determined by relative
concentrations of chemicals across the sensing interface. Conventional
potentiometric sensors are designed for ion analysis, for example,
pH probe.7 Ion-selective membranes enable
measuring the transmembrane potential caused by biased transport of
target ions. However, in vivo potentiometry has been limited to a
narrow range of ionic species due to the lack of suitable permselective
membranes for the majority of neurochemicals. Most recently, galvanic
redox potentiometry (GRP) was brought up as a new concept of in vivo
analysis. GRP is built on a galvanic cell configuration: an anodic
indicating electrode (oxidation of analyte, EI) and a cathodic reference electrode (reduction
of electron acceptors like O2, ER) connected by a high-impedance voltmeter. In
principle, circuit current is infinitesimal enough for reactants to
establish thermodynamically determined potentials at equilibria of
the heterogeneous electron transfer with electrodes. When E = ER – EI is positive, that is, negative
Gibbs free energy (ΔG = −nFE), the whole-cell redox process occurs
spontaneously, and the GRP sensor delivers concentration-dependent
OCP signals in a self-driven manner.21

Bard and co-workers reported the first demonstration of ultrasensitive
potentiometric monitoring of single nanoparticle collision at a microelectrode
in 2012,22 bringing OCP-based methods up
to the comparable level of nanoamperometry. It is reasonable to foresee
real-time measurement of rapid chemical communication between neurons
by GRP. In the meantime, we have to admit that it is still at the
very beginning stage of its development toward in vivo analysis. Firstly,
selectivity is the biggest challenge as the OCP output cannot be resolved,
so GRP does not measure the basal level either. The only way out of
the riddle is the rational design and modification of the sensing
interface (e.g., electrode kinetics, surface binding, and recognition
units, etc.) to enhance OCP responses to neurochemical transients
of interest other than interfering fluctuations. Secondly, steady
performance of the reference electrode at constant ER is key to quantification. Potential disturbance
may come from alterations in electron acceptors, pH, and other electroactive
species. Microcompartmentalization of the reference electrode in a
favorable working environment can avoid unwanted perturbation in ER. Finally, the self-driven nature
will aid GRP development in many ways. The most appealing benefit
is the improved compatibility with minimally invasive and longitude
brain monitoring.

2.4 Ion Transport-Based Sensing
Besides
electroactive catecholamine neurotransmitters, most neurochemicals
are electroinactive and undetectable by direct electrolysis. Enzymatic
or nonenzymatic electrocatalysts on the electrode surface are required
to overcome the large electron transfer kinetic barrier and generate
electron currents. In recent years, rise of ion transport-based sensing
methods has introduced a completely different perspective for in vivo
analysis of electroinactive molecules.23Figure 4a illustrates
the typical setup of one Ag/AgCl wire (working electrode) placed in
a micro or nanopipette with the other (reference electrode) in bulk
testing solution. Electrical migration of small ions in electrolyte
solution—usually K+ and Cl–—forms
ion current, which is readily modulated by the spatial confinement
effect of the pipette tip. To be specific, tip geometry, pore size,
and surface chemistry will all influence the ion current. Measurements
can be performed in two modes. In the CV mode, potentials are repeatedly
scanned between +1 and −1 V. Current intensities at two potentials
of the same value but opposite signs are compared; if not equal, the
phenomenon is named ion current rectification (ICR). ICR was mostly
investigated with nanopipettes, asymmetric electrolyte solution or
biconical pipettes, until Yu et al. observed micrometer-scale ICR
(MICR) at polyelectrolyte brush-modified micropipettes in symmetric
electrolyte solution. In the proposed three-layer model, interior
surface charge accounted for different current changes at positive
and negative potentials.24 An MICR-based
biosensor was constructed by neutralizing the polyimidazole layer
(positively charged) inside a micropipette with attached ATP aptamers
(negatively charged). Cerebral ATP sampled by microdialysis strongly
bound the aptamer and caused its dissociation from the inner surface.
Exposure of imidazole moieties resulted in an increase of the net
surface charge and thus the MICR ratio. A notable achievement with
this biosensor is the determination of dialysate concentration of
ATP from brain cortex, suggesting that MICR-based methods can measure
the basal level of neurochemicals.25

set-up for ion transport-based sensing and schematic

concentration. Reprint with permission from ref (25). (c) Schematic illustration
of single nanoparticle collision at the orifice of a nanopipette in
two modes. Collision and stay produces staircase current. Collision
and leave produces spike currents. Reprint with permission from ref (26).

In the amperometric mode, ion current is continuously recorded
at a constant potential, which also drives the migration of analytes
toward or away from the probing nanopipette tip. In analyzing single
particles like biomacromolecules, lipid vesicles or cells, there are
three major types of particle–pipette interactions: translocation,
collide-and-leave, and collide-and-stay. The former two scenarios
produce current spikes by resistive-pulse principle, and the latter
one leads to staircase current decrease due to the partial blockage
of the tip pore. Up to date, a large body of publications on this
topic are about particle translocation kinetics through the nanopore
or the nanochannel. In 2016, Li et al. reported a description of single
nanoparticle events at the orifice of a nanopipette. In this fundamental
study, charged polystyrene particles were employed to unravel the
role of particle size, surface property, electric-field force, electroosmotic
force, and elastic force in shaping current transients (blip or staircase)
upon collision (Figure 4c).26 Although it has not been applied
in vivo yet, this method has shown similarities with nanoamperometry
in ultrasensitivity and high spatiotemporal resolution. Moreover,
it may analyze the nonredox aspects in neurochemistry, such as the
membrane composition and electroinactive content of vesicles.

3 In Vivo Imaging
High-resolution imaging is advantageous
in visualizing nanoscale
neurochemical dynamics in both qualitative and quantitative ways.
As a powerful tool for noninvasive analysis, brain imaging techniques,
especially fluorescent microscopy and mass spectrometric imaging,
have been extensively reviewed elsewhere12 and are beyond our discussion here. Instead, several latest updates
that may represent future research directions will be highlighted
in this section.

3.1 Super-Resolution Nanotube
Tracking
The microenvironment in the brain is a dynamic community
of neurochemicals
that varies during physiological and pathological processes. Direct
imaging of the structure and organization of the microenvironment
in situ has important implications for analyzing brain neurochemistry.
Compared to small molecular indicators, fluorescent, or luminescent
nanoparticles at moderate diffusion rates are better at completing
the task in combination with super-resolution deep tissue localization
microscopy. Single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs) stand out as excellent nano-emitters
because of their brightness in near-infrared luminescent emission,
photostability, biocompatibility, and good penetrating ability. Previously
super-resolution single SWCNT tracking was proved successful in quantitatively
probing molecular motion in cytoplasm and mapping intracellular fluctuation.27 Godin et al. recently applied this technique
to in vivo analysis of ECS in the brain. They injected SWCNTs into
live rats before preparation of acute brain slices and collected super-resolution
images of SWCNT-intercalated slices. Diffusion and distribution of
SWCNTs reflected the structural heterogeneity in forming the microenvironment
of ECS. Together with video recording such structural dynamics at
nanoscale was monitored by tracking the movement of SWCNTs (Figure 5a). Moreover, the
characteristic length-to-diameter ratio of a single nanotube endows
it with different diffusion accessibility in response to local environmental
fluctuation. Therefore, quantitative information on the interplay
of nanotube geometry and physiochemical properties of ECS (e.g., viscosity
and molecular crowding) can be extracted.28

sensors for measurements of DA dynamics in freely behaving animals.

3.2 Deep Multi-Photon Imaging
Optical
imaging of brain tissue over a depth of 30 μm greatly enriches
structural and chemical information about neuronal activities. However,
tissue scattering limits the signal-to-background ratio (SBR) and
thus imaging depth. Although neurons within rat cortex can be monitored
by two-photon microscopy, it still involves tissue treatment and optics
implantation. Ouzounov et al. lately established a multi-photon imaging
platform for noninvasive deep brain imaging at high spatiotemporal
resolution. Three-photon microscopy at excitation of 1300 nm enabled
capturing activity traces of neurons labeled by genetically encoded
calcium indicators. As demonstrated, it exhibited remarkably higher
SBR than two-photon microscopy did at the same depth because of the reduced out-of-focus
risk at a higher order of nonlinear excitation and scattering at longer-wavelength
excitation (Figure 5b). Spontaneous activities of about 150 labeled neurons deep into
the hippocampal stratum pyramidale (∼1 mm in depth) were concurrently
monitored.29 This deep multiphoton imaging
method offers new opportunities for three-dimensional brain mapping
of neurochemical dynamics.

3.3 Brain Imaging at Free Behavioral
State
In vivo imaging of neuronal chemical patterns in awake,
freely moving
animals deciphers the neurochemical basis underlying behaviors. To
meet the challenges in sample labeling and spatiotemporal resolution,
Zeng, and co-workers engineered a genetically encoded GPCR-activation-based
DA probe (GRABDA) by fusing a structure-sensitive green
fluorescent protein (cpEGFP) into the membrane DA receptor. Binding
of released DA to its receptor triggered protein structure/conformational
transitions and then large fluorescence increase of GRABDA. The whole activation process displayed subcellular resolution,
fast kinetics (subsecond), high binding affinity (nanomolar) and specificity.
Because these probes were expressed in transgenic living animals (fruit
flies, zebrafish and mice), flickering fluorescent signals related
to rapid quantum DA release and binding were recorded at free behavioral
states (Figure 5c).
Moreover, optogenetically elicited nigrostriatal DA release and dynamic
mesoaccumbens DA signaling in mice were quantitatively analyzed during
Pavlovian conditioning and sexual behaviors.30 Similar work with structure-sensitive fluorescence was conducted
on acetocholine receptors to analyze acetocholine-mediated chemical
communications.31 All these successful
attempts pave a solid foundation for quantitative imaging of neurochemistry
in synaptic events, circuits, and brain function in free animals,
especially with the assistance of miniature fast high-resolution microscopy.32

4 Multimodal Analysis
Multimodal analysis based on a combination of different sensing
methods provides comprehensive information and knowledge to interpret
the complex community in the brain. As discussed earlier, single-cell
amperometry with intracellular VIEC enables a quantitative comparison
of molecular amounts in unfused vesicles and exocytosis to demonstrate
the partial release mechanism. Imaging tools can also be correlated
to collect comprehensive snapshots of one single event from different
perspectives. For example, super-resolution optical microscopy combined
with mass spectrometric imaging (e.g., nanoscaled secondary ion mass
spectrometry or nanoSIMS) visualize and quantify chemical patterns
of isotope-pulsed neurons in the meantime. A detailed description
of correlated approaches can be accessed in the review by Phan et
al.12

Another type of multimodal
analysis is the simultaneous monitoring
of neurochemicals and neuron spike firings. In early 1990s, Crespi
et al. demonstrated that concurrent electrochemical and electrophysiological
measurements can be accomplished by a single CFE. This was done in
serial mode, that is, chemical and electrical signals alternatively
sampled with a very short interval.33,34 Wightman and
co-workers combined FSCV and cell firing recording by a CFE to investigate
the direct role of DA in the reward behavior. In this work, they revealed
the coincident DA changes and neuronal firing patterns activated by
intracranial self-stimulation in nucleus accumbens. Such a temporal
link suggested that their roles may be similar during rewarding and
drug self-administration.35,36 With the rapid development
of microfabrication and micropatterning, arrays of micro or nanoelectrodes
can now be integrated onto a miniature substrate for electrical recording
parallelized to electroanalysis or optical imaging.37−39 Compared to
the serial mode, parallel monitoring at multiple sites establishes
a spatial link between chemical and electrical patterns in neuron
communication and signaling.

5 Outlooks
In conclusion,
in vivo elecroanalytical and imaging approaches
have a promising future in quantitative molecular decoding of neural
physiology and pathology. However, we have to admit that accurate
deciphering of the correlation between chemical information and live
functions of the brain at the in vivo level will remain the biggest
challenge in a long period of time. Most of the reported achievements
have been obtained with isolated cells, brain slices, and small animals.
Longitude real-time brain analysis of higher-ordered primates or even
humans to track chemical traces in different physiological or pathological
states without intervening their activities is still extremely difficult.
Following current trends in method development, in vivo brain analysis
is stepping into a new era, and its boundaries with a wide variety
of research areas are kept blurring. Advanced soft materials possessing
good electronic conductivity or transparency and biocompatibility
make flexible miniature sensors for implanted and chronical monitoring
in free animals or humans. Advanced fabrication techniques enable
configuring integrated sensing platforms for high-throughput multidimensional
brain screening/mapping. For this purpose, GRP sensor may be an excellent
candidate because of its self-driven nature and ease of miniaturization.
In addition, microtomy-assisted photoacoustic microscopy (mPAM) is
a novel strategy for label-free, automated, noninvasive, and three-dimensional
whole brain imaging with high fidelity through simultaneous sensing
of nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids.40 Finally, in vivo brain analysis may be coupled by chemical biological
tools (chemical modification, protein engineering, and gene editing,
etc.) toward smart regulation of neuron function in response to abnormal
chemical fluctuations. This would make brain neurochemistry understandable
and controllable as well, being of great significance to early diagnosis
and management of neural diseases.
