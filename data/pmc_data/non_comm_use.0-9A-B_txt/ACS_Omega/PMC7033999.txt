A fibrous grafted metal adsorbent
with a piperazinyl-dithiocarbamate
(PZ-DTC) group was synthesized by radiation-induced emulsion grafting
of glycidyl methacrylate onto a polyethylene-coated polypropylene
nonwoven fabric (PE/PP-NF) and subsequent three-step chemical modifications
consisting of amination with N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)piperazine (N-Boc-piperazine, NBPZ),
deprotection of the Boc group with HCl, and dithiocarbamation with
carbon disulfide (CS2). By using the NBPZ reagent in the
amination step, the self-cross-linking of piperazine (PZ) could be
completely suppressed, unlike using the PZ reagent. Consequently,
the PZ-DTC group density of the fibrous grafted metal adsorbent synthesized
through NBPZ attained 2.122 mmol-PZ-DTC/g-adsorbent, which was approximately
6 times higher than that of the metal adsorbent synthesized through
PZ. The fibrous grafted metal adsorbent with the PZ-DTC group selectively
adsorbed heavy metal ions over light metal ions. Furthermore, it exhibited
high adsorption capacity, particularly for Cu2+. The Cu2+ adsorption capacity was determined to be 1.903 mmol-Cu2+/g-adsorbent by a batchwise adsorption test using a single-metal-ion
aqueous solution at pH 6. The order of metal ion selectivity of the
fibrous grafted metal adsorbent with the PZ-DTC group was Na+ < Mg2+, Ca2+, Co2+, Cd2+ < Pb2+ ≪ Cu2+, and Co2+ ≈ Ni2+ < Zn2+ ≪ Cu2+. In addition, the fibrous grafted metal adsorbent with the PZ-DTC
group did not lose its metal adsorption function even under highly
alkaline conditions (pH 15). It could recover Cu2+ efficiently
and selectively from a high-concentration Na+ aqueous solution
at this pH. The Cu2+ adsorption capacity of the fibrous
grafted metal adsorbent with the PZ-DTC group was 0.754 mmol-Cu2+/g-adsorbent under a highly alkaline condition, a 10 M NaOH
aqueous solution at pH 15. This value was approximately 2.4 times
higher than that of the other grafted adsorbent with an amine-type
functional group.

Introduction
The high integration of semiconductor
devices, which constitute
a key factor that has impelled the development of modern society,
has been achieved by innovations in microfabrication technology. The
number of transistors in densely integrated circuits continues to
increase adhering to the empirical rule called Moore’s law,
which states that the density doubles roughly every 2 years.1 While the linewidth of the earliest integrated
circuits (in the early 1970s) was 10 μm, it has recently been
announced by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Ltd. that a test
chip with a circuit line width of 5 nm will be prototyped on the production
line.2 Si wafers for the 5 nm process technology
are required to exhibit exceptionally high surface smoothness on the
order of nanometers. If the chemical solution for the surface etching
of Si wafers is contaminated with a concentration of a few μg/g
(ppm), the Cu2+ diffuses into the Si wafer and develops
pits on the surface of the wafer after the polishing treatment.3 Therefore, the development of a novel adsorbent
for removing Cu2+ and other ionic species from etchants
is highly desired.

Radiation-induced grafting, a convenient
technique for surface
modification of polymers, can impart the desired functional groups
into commercially available trunk polymers without deteriorating their
physical or chemical properties. This technique is suitable for synthesizing
new high-performance materials. Examples including metal adsorbents
for collecting useful metals or removing harmful metals,4−8 ion exchange fiber for antibody purification,9 dyes adsorbent for wastewater treatment,10 proton-conductive membrane for fuel cell devices,11,12 solid catalysts for biodiesel fuel productiony,13 flame-retardant fabric,14 superhydrophobic
fabrics,15 drug-eluting material,16 wiper blade rubber,17 and so forth have been researched and developed. Especially, the
fibrous adsorbents synthesized by the radiation-induced grafting have
a large specific surface area and high contact efficiency, so they
can capture target substances even under high flow rate conditions.
In the column treatment, the adsorption rate of the fibrous grafted
adsorbent was 10–100 times higher than those of commercially
available granular resins.18,19 The high adsorption
rate of the grafted adsorbent was explained by the negligible diffusional
mass-transfer resistance of target substances to functional groups.
The mass transfer of the grafted adsorbent was aided by the convective
flow through the fabric, whereas the mass transfer of the granular
resin was suppressed by the slow diffusion rate into the resin.20 Recently, we have succeeded in developing water
purifier for radioactive cesium removal from contaminated natural
water by making full use of the high-speed adsorption characteristics
of the fibrous grafted adsorbent.21 In
our previous study, we developed a metal adsorbent for an alkaline
etching aqueous solution for Si wafers by radiation-induced emulsion
grafting of glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) onto the polyethylene nonwoven
fabric and subsequent amination with 2,2′-iminodiethanol (IDE).22 The fibrous grafted metal adsorbent with the
IDE group could selectively remove trace amounts of Ni2+ and Cu2+ that were dissolved in highly alkaline solutions
(such as 48 wt % NaOH and 48 wt % KOH aqueous solutions) used in the
surface etching process of Si wafers. The liquid-passage rate and
the lifetime of the fibrous grafted metal adsorbent with the IDE group
were 20 times higher and 30 times longer, respectively, than those
of the commercial resin with a tertiary amine group (DUOLITE A378D,
Sumika Chemtex Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan). These performances satisfy
the requirement for adsorbents in removing metal ions from Si wafer
etchants. Therefore, and because its adsorption capacity is significantly
higher than that of the commercial resin used in Si wafer processing,
the fibrous grafted metal adsorbent with the IDE group was commercialized
as METOLATE.

With the remarkable evolution and innovation of
semiconductor technology
in recent years, the development of higher performance adsorbents
for removing contaminating trace metal ions in Si wafer etchants is
highly desirable. Although conventional chelating functional groups
such as IDE, iminodiacetic acid (IDA), and ethylenediamine (EDA) groups
(which have been used as metal-adsorptive functional groups) have
a certain degree of metal ion selectivity, their use does not result
in further improvement in the adsorbent performance. This is because
the conventional chelating functional groups adsorb heavy metal ions
as well as Na+ (which is the main component of Si wafer
etchants) simultaneously. In order to further improve the adsorption
performance from those of available metal adsorbents, it is necessary
to design a new functional group that can selectively recognize and
efficiently adsorb trace amounts of heavy metal ions from a highly
concentrated matrix solution. An index indicating the affinity between
metal ions and functional groups is the hard and soft acids and bases
(HSAB) theory.23−25 The concept underlying the HSAB theory can be summarized
as a simple rule: hard species favor interacting with hard species,
and soft species tend to favor interacting with soft species. Based
on this theory, the oxygen-based and nitrogen-based functional groups
such as IDE, IDA, and EDA are classified into the “hard base”
and “medium base.” Moreover, these functional groups
exhibit relatively high affinities for light metal ions. Therefore,
the oxygen-based and nitrogen-based functional groups are not necessarily
optimal for the capturing of heavy metal ions. Meanwhile, it is well
established that sulfur is a relatively soft atom, and a sulfur-based
functional group is classified as a “soft” base. A sulfur-based
functional group is likely to exhibit a relatively high affinity for
heavy metal ions than the oxygen-based and nitrogen-based functional
groups. Therefore, it is considered that a metal adsorbent having
a sulfur-based functional group can selectively and efficiently remove
heavy metal ions from high-concentration alkali aqueous solutions
such as Si wafer etchants.

The objective of this study was to
synthesize a metal adsorbent
having a sulfur-based functional group, with high affinity for heavy
metals, by radiation-induced grafting and subsequent chemical modifications.
In order to evaluate the metal adsorption capacity and selectivity
of the synthesized metal adsorbent, we conducted batchwise metal adsorption
tests. Furthermore, the metal adsorption performance under a highly
alkaline condition (a 10 M NaOH aqueous solution at pH 15) was also
evaluated.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis of Fibrous Grafted Metal Adsorbent
with Piperazinyl-Dithiocarbamate
Group
Radiation-Induced Emulsion Grafting
Fibrous grafted
metal adsorbent with the piperazinyl-dithiocarbamate (PZ-DTC) group
was synthesized by a radiation-induced emulsion grafting technique
and subsequent chemical modifications. The synthesis scheme of the
fibrous grafted metal adsorbent with the PZ-DTC group is shown in Figure 1. In this study,
the fibrous grafted metal adsorbent with PZ-DTC was synthesized through
two chemical modification pathways.

Figure 1 Synthesis schemes of fibrous grafted metal
adsorbent with a PZ-DTC
group.

GMA and chloromethylstyrene (CMS)
have been used as grafting monomers
because these monomers can easily introduce functional groups onto
the graft chains by chemical modification after grafting onto the
trunk polymer. It is well known that CMS is more carcinogenic than
GMA. For this reason, CMS is very difficult to use in adsorbent manufacturing
plants and is not a very suitable monomer from an industrial point
of view. In this study, the GMA was used as a grafting monomer and
a polyethylene-coated polypropylene nonwoven fabric (PE/PP-NF) was
used as a trunk material.

Regarding the grafting technique,
it has been reported that emulsion
grafting proceeded the graft polymerization effectively, and in the
case of the vinyl acetate monomer, the value of degree of grafting
(Dg [%]) of emulsion grafting enhanced 100 times higher compared with
using an organic solvent such as methanol.26,27 It has been found that polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan monolaurate
(Tween 20) is a suitable surfactant for the stabilization of GMA micelle
in water.28 For these reasons, we adopted
GMA emulsion grafting in this study. As for the Dg value, when Dg
is 200%, the molar density of epoxy group is 4.7 mmol/g-grafted PE/PP-NF.
If the conversion of the epoxy group is assumed to be greater than
50% in the amination step, the PZ-DTC group density of the synthesized
adsorbent would be at least 1.6 mmol-PZ-DTC/g-adsorbent. This value
is comparable to those of commercially available resins and is sufficient
for practical use as a metal adsorbent. Therefore, the GMA-grafted
PE/PP-NF (PE/PP-NF-g-GMA) samples with 200% Dg was
used as a precursor of the metal adsorbent in subsequent experiments.

Introduction of PZ-DTC Group through PZ
Functional
group density is the most important parameter for metal adsorbents
to capture large amounts of metal ions and varies greatly depending
on chemical modification conditions and type of chemical reagents.
Thus, first, the effect of the amination reagent on the functional
group density was examined. The functional group can be conveniently
introduced into the GMA-grafted polymer by the ring-opening reaction
of the epoxy group of the GMA-graft chain. Dipotassium piperazine-1,4-bis(carbodithioate)
has PZ-DTC groups. Although this reagent functions as a chelating
reagent for heavy metals, it cannot be introduced directly onto the
GMA-graft chain because it does not have a reaction site with the
epoxy group. Therefore, to introduce the PZ-DTC groups onto the GMA-graft
chains in this study, a two-step chemical modification consisting
of the amination with piperazine (PZ) (step 1) and the subsequent
dithiocarbamation with carbon disulfide (CS2) (step 2)
was attempted.

It is well established that in general, the type
of solvent substantially influences the degree of amination (Da [%])
in the amination process. Therefore, the effect of the solvent on
Da was investigated, and these results are summarized in Table 1. The PZ group density
(PZ density [mmol-PZ/g-adsorbent]), self-cross-linked PZ ratio (C-PZ
ratio [%]), and PZ-DTC group density (PZ-DTC density [mmol-PZ-DTC/g-adsorbent])
are also listed in this table. In the case where water was used as
the solvent, the Da, PZ density, and PZ-DTC group density were 5.2%,
0.244 mmol-PZ/g-adsorbent and 0.005 mmol-PZ-DTC/g-adsorbent, respectively.
These values were too low for metal adsorbents.

Meanwhile,
in the case where organic solvents were used, the amination
of PZ could be performed efficiently as compared with the water solvent,
and Da exceeded 50% regardless of the organic solvent types. However,
even after a 24 h amination, Da remained at approximately 50 and did
not attain 100%. Additionally, the PZ-DTC group densities of the final
products (PE/PP-NF-g-GMA-PZ-DTC) were considerably
lower than the values predicted based on the PZ densities of each
adsorbent. The dithiocarbamate (DTC) group was introduced onto only
12% or less of the existing PZ group in the adsorbent. The reason
for these lower PZ-DTC densities was considered to be that most of
the PZ was self-cross-linked in the GMA-graft chain. That is, two
nitrogen atoms of PZ both reacted quickly with two epoxy groups on
the GMA-graft chains, and the self-cross-linking structures of GMA-graft
chains were formed through PZ, as shown in Figure 2. The C-PZ ratio exceeded 85% regardless
of the organic solvent types because of the rapid amination of epoxy
groups with PZ. Furthermore, observing the FT-IR spectra of PE/PP-NF-g-GMA-PZ samples with a high C-PZ ratio, it was proved that
the self-cross-linking had occurred because several peaks derived
from the epoxy group disappeared completely. In the case where ethanol
was used, the PZ-DTC density was 0.106 mmol-PZ-DTC/g-adsorbent, which
was 1/20 of the value predicted based on the introduction amount of
PZ. This low PZ-DTC density was also insufficient for practical use.

Figure 2 Self-cross-linking
structure of PZ in GMA-graft chains.

To suppress the self-cross-linking of the PZ, that is, to increase
the proportion of noncross-linked PZ groups in the GMA-graft chains,
a highly concentrated PZ solution was used. With regard to the noncross-linked
PZ group, only one amine group of the PZ group is bound to the epoxy
group of the GMA-graft chain (resembling a pendant) so that the DTC
group could be efficiently introduced in the next dithiocarbamation
process with CS2. As presented in Table 1, the self-cross-linking of the PZ could
be suppressed slightly by using the highly concentrated PZ solution.
The PZ-DTC density of the 5 M PZ-ethanol became 0.358 mmol-PZ-DTC/g-adsorbent,
which was approximately 3.5 times higher than that of the 0.5 M PZ-ethanol
solution. As mentioned above, although this attempt to use highly
concentrated PZ solution could improve the metal adsorption performance
marginally, most of the PZ introduced onto the GMA-graft chains were
consumed for self-cross-linking. The C-PZ ratio of the fibrous grafted
adsorbent treated with 5 M PZ-ethanol became 86.4%, which was also
inadequate for practical use.

Introduction of PZ-DTC
Group through NBPZ
In the case
of the introduction of the PZ-DTC group through PZ, the self-cross-linking
of PZ could not be completely suppressed. This is because the PZ had
two NH groups that functioned as reactive sites with the epoxy group.
Therefore, in the experiment described in this section, N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)piperazine (N-Boc-piperazine, NBPZ) was used as an amination reagent in order
to prevent self-cross-linking of PZ completely. The NBPZ was a PZ
derivative exhibiting a structure in which a NH group of PZ was protected
by the tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group, and the other
NH group remained intact. The Boc group is one of the most widely
used amine-protecting groups. The amine group protected with a Boc
group loses its reactivity. The Boc group is stable under a basic
hydrolysis condition. In addition, it is well established that the
Boc group can be conveniently deprotected under acidic conditions
to obtain the free amine, which can be used for further chemical modifications.
In the case where NBPZ was used as an amination reagent, the self-cross-linking
of PZ could be completely prevented. This was because the NBPZ had
only one NH group that could contribute to the amination. As a result,
Da, the (NBPZ density [mmol-NBPZ/g-adsorbent]), and the C-PZ ratio
of the PE/PP-NF-g-GMA-NBPZ sample were 96.2%, 2.496
mmol-NBPZ/g-adsorbent, and 0%, respectively (Table 1). Furthermore, the effect of the amination
time on Da was investigated. It was observed that the amination using
NBPZ proceeded smoothly and rapidly, and it was completed within 1
h. The Boc groups of NBPZ did not cleave even after 24 h because this
amination process was carried out under a basic condition (pH 10.5).
Consequently, the self-cross-linking reaction through PZ did not occur.

To introduce the DTC group onto the NBPZ group, the Boc group of
NBPZ must be deprotected. Therefore, the effect of the deprotection
temperature and time on the degree of deprotection of the Boc group
(Dd [%]) when the PE/PP-NF-g-GMA-NBPZ sample was
treated with a 1 M HCl aqueous solution was investigated. As expected,
higher deprotection temperatures resulted in faster deprotection of
the Boc group. In particular, the deprotection was remarkably accelerated
at extremely high temperatures. As is evident from Figure 3, at 50 °C, complete deprotection
of the Boc group required approximately 3 h. In contrast, at 80 °C,
complete deprotection required 1 h, which is less than one-third of
the time required at 50 °C. The above results reveal that the
optimum temperature and time for complete deprotection of the Boc
group in the PE/PP-NF-g-GMA-NBPZ sample were 80 °C
and 1 h or higher, respectively. In addition, in this Boc-deprotection
process, the self-cross-linking reaction of PZ did not occur after
deprotection. This was because there was no epoxy group capable of
reacting with the terminal NH groups of Boc-deprotected NBPZ.

Figure 3 Effect of deprotection
temperature on Dd of the Boc group of NBPZ.

We succeeded in completely preventing self-cross-linking of PZ
by first introducing NBPZ onto the GMA-graft chain and then deprotecting
its Boc groups. Next, the effect of the dithiocarbamation condition
with CS2 on the PZ-DTC density was investigated. The results
are provided in Figure 4. In cases of the 2 wt % CS2 solution, 32 wt % 1 M NaOH
aqueous solution, and 66 wt % methanol, although the PZ-DTC density
of the final product was improved with an increase in the reaction
temperature, the introduction rate of the DTC group to the PZ group
of the final products did not attain 100% even after 24 h. If it is
assumed that the introduction rate of the DTC group to the PZ group
of the final products is 100%, the PZ-DTC density of the final product
is likely to be 2.516 mmol-PZ-DTC/g-adsorbent. After 24 h of the 2 wt % CS2 treatment, the PZ-DTC densities at
20, 30, and 40 °C were 0.283, 1.004, and 1.669 mmol-PZ-DTC/g-adsorbent,
respectively. The introduction rate of the DTC group to the PZ group
at 20, 30, and 40 °C were 11, 39, and 66%, respectively.

Figure 4 Effect of dithiocarbamation
condition on PZ-DTC density. Blue circle:
2 wt % CS2 solution, 20 °C; red triangle: 2 wt % CS2 solution, 30 °C; green square: 2 wt % CS2 solution, 40 °C; purple inverted triangle: 20 wt % CS2 solution, 40 °C.

To improve the PZ-DTC
density, it is generally preferable to perform
the CS2 treatment at a high reaction temperature. However,
because the boiling point of CS2 is 46.3 °C, increasing
the reaction temperature above 45 °C is hazardous. Therefore,
next, we attempted treatment with a highly concentrated CS2 solution. As shown in Figure 4, in cases of 20 wt % CS2 solution, 35 wt % 10
M NaOH aqueous solution, and 45 wt % methanol, the
dithiocarbamation with CS2 was accelerated remarkably.
The PZ-DTC density leveled off after a 12 h dithiocarbamation, and
the highest obtained PZ-DTC density was 2.122 mmol-PZ-DTC/g-adsorbent.
At this time, the introduction rate of the DTC group onto the PZ group
was approximately 85%. The fact that the experimentally obtained values
of the PZ-DTC density and the introduction rate of the DTC group onto
the PZ group were lower than the theoretical values appears to be
owing to the steric hindrance of CS2. Although this PZ-DTC
density of the metal adsorbent synthesized through NBPZ was marginally
lower than the theoretical value, the PZ-DTC density of the metal
adsorbent synthesized through NBPZ became approximately 6 times higher
than that of the metal adsorbent synthesized through PZ. Specifically,
the PZ-DTC density of the fibrous grafted adsorbent treated with 5
M PZ-ethanol solution was 0.358 mmol-PZ-DTC/g-adsorbent. Meanwhile,
the PZ-DTC density of the fibrous grafted adsorbent synthesized through
NBPZ attained 2.122 mmol-PZ-DTC/g-adsorbent. Moreover, its PZ-DTC
density was sufficient for its practical use as a metal adsorbent.
The above results reveal that the self-cross-linking of PZ in the
synthesis of a metal adsorbent with a PZ-DTC group can be prevented
by interposing NBPZ. Thereby, a remarkable metal adsorbent exhibiting
a high functional group density can be synthesized.

FTIR-ATR Analysis
The pristine PE/PP-NF, the grafting
of GMA onto PE/PP-NF, the introduction of NBPZ group to GMA-graft
chain, the deprotection of Boc group from NBPZ group, and the incorporation
of DTC group to PZ group can be verified using an attenuated total
reflection-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectrometer (model
Spectrum One equipped with ATR accessory, Perkin-Elmer Inc., MA, USA).
The samples were scanned in the range of 520–2300 cm–1 with a resolution of 1 cm–1. Figure 5 shows the results of the FTIR
analysis. The FTIR spectrum of pristine PE/PP-NF, Figure 5A, had peaks characteristic
of its olefinic nature: 1472 cm–1 (CH2 ben.), 1462 cm–1 (CH2 ben.), 1375 cm–1 (CH2 wag. and/or sym. CH3 movements),
731 cm–1 (CH2 rock.), and 718 cm–1 (CH2 rock.).29 After grafting with GMA, as shown in Figure 5B, several new peaks attributed to the GMA-graft
chain appeared in the spectrum of the PE/PP-NF-g-GMA:
1724 cm–1 (C=O str.), 1254 cm–1 (−C–O– str.), 1146 cm–1 (−C–O–
str.), 905 cm–1 (antisym. epoxy group def.), 842
cm–1 (sym. epoxy group def.), and 757 cm–1 (epoxy group def.).30−33 Postgrafting amination with NBPZ resulted in the ring-opening reaction
of the epoxy groups and introduction of the NBPZ group. As shown in Figure 5C, the epoxy ring-opening
reaction led to the disappearance of the epoxy group peaks, and the
introduction of the NBPZ group resulted in the appearance of new peaks:
1693 cm–1 (C=O str. in Boc group), 1364 cm–1 (CH3 ben. tert-butyl
group in Boc group), and 1165 cm–1 (C–N str.).34−36 After deprotection, as shown in Figure 5D, several peaks attributed to the Boc group
disappeared, and a new broad peak appeared at around 1595 cm–1, which is attributed to the NH stretching mode.37 After dithiocarbamation, as shown in Figure 5E, several new peaks attributed to the DTC
group appeared in the spectrum of the PE/PP-NF-g-GMA-PZ-DTC:
1406 cm–1 (C–S str.), 1211 cm–1 (C=S str.), 988 cm–1 (asym. CS2 str.), and 919 cm–1 (sym. CS2 str.)38−41 These features indicate that the PZ-DTC groups were successfully
imparted to the PE/PP-NF-g-GMA sample through the
three-step chemical modifications consisting of amination with NBPZ,
deprotection of Boc group with HCl, and dithiocarbamation with CS2. Table 2 presents
the summary of the properties of the fibrous grafted metal adsorbent
with the PZ-DTC group synthesized through NBPZ.

Table 3 is the summarized results of batchwise metal adsorption
tests with the synthesized adsorbent with the PZ-DTC group. In this
adsorption tests, the metal ion aqueous solution containing a single
element was used. As expected, the synthesized adsorbent having the
PZ-DTC group could adsorb cationic species. In particular, the fibrous
grafted metal adsorbent having the PZ-DTC group exhibits a high adsorption
capacity for Cu2+ (1.903 mmol-Cu2+/g-adsorbent).
Meanwhile, the metal adsorption capacities for the light metals such
as Mg2+, Sr2+, and Ba2+ became marginally
smaller than those for the heavy metals. The above results reveal
that the synthesized adsorbent with the PZ-DTC group functioned as
a metal adsorbent, and its metal adsorption capacity was sufficient
for practical use.

Ion Selectivity with Binary Mixed Metal Mode
Secondly, the
metal ion selectivity of the fibrous grafted metal
adsorbent with the PZ-DTC group was examined through batchwise adsorption
tests using metal ion aqueous solutions containing two elements, such
as Pb2+ and another metal ion. In this adsorption test
(Test 1), six types of binary mixed metal ion aqueous solutions (containing
Na+/Pb2+, Mg2+/Pb2+, Ca2+/Pb2+, Co2+/Pb2+, Cd2+/Pb2+, and Cu2+/Pb2+) were
used. The results are summarized in Table 4 (A). As shown in the table, in the case
of the Na+/Pb2+ mixed aqueous solution, only
Pb2+ (a heavy metal ion) was selectively adsorbed, and
Na+ was not adsorbed. In the cases of Mg2+/Pb2+, Ca2+/Pb2+, Co2+/Pb2+, and Cd2+/Pb2+ mixed aqueous solutions,
Pb2+ (the heavier metal ion) was selectively adsorbed.
The adsorption capacity of Pb2+ was over 3 times that of
the adsorption capacities of Mg2+, Ca2+, Co2+, and Cd2+. The metal adsorption capacities of
each metal ion per gram of the adsorbent were 0.279 mmol-Mg2+/0.958 mmol-Pb2+, 0.240 mmol-Ca2+/0.818 mmol-Pb2+, 0.208 mmol-Co2+/1.021 mmol-Pb2+,
and 0.076 mmol-Cd2+/0.820 mmol-Pb2+, respectively.
In the case of the Cu2+/Pb2+ mixed aqueous solution,
unlike the previous cases, the lighter Cu2+ was selectively
adsorbed over the heavier Pb2+. The adsorption capacities
of Cu2+ and Pb2+ were 0.828 mmol-Cu2+/g-adsorbent and 0.127 mmol-Pb2+/g-adsorbent, respectively.
Based on the above results, the order of metal ion selectivity of
the fibrous grafted metal adsorbent with the PZ-DTC group was Na+ < Mg2+, Ca2+, Co2+, Cd2+ < Pb2+ ≪ Cu2+. It was also
observed that the fibrous grafted metal adsorbent with the PZ-DTC
group exhibited specific selectivity for Pb2+ and Cu2+.

Third, the metal ion
selectivity for Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+,
and Zn2+ was examined. Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+ are classified
into the fourth period in the periodic table, and their atomic weights
are almost similar. In this adsorption test (Test 2), six types of
binary mixed metal ion aqueous solutions containing Co2+/Ni2+, Co2+/Cu2+, Co2+/Zn2+, Ni2+/Cu2+, Ni2+/Zn2+, and Cu2+/Zn2+ were used.
The results are summarized in Table 4 (B). As shown in the table, in the case of the Co2+/Ni2+ mixed aqueous solution, the adsorption capacities
of Co2+ and Ni2+ were almost identical. The
adsorption capacities of Co2+ and Ni2+ were
0.377 mmol-Co2+/g-adsorbent and 0.400 mmol-Ni2+/g-adsorbent, respectively. With regard to Zn2+, the adsorption
capacity of Zn2+ was nearly 2 times those of Co2+ and Ni2+ in the presence of Co2+ and Ni2+. In the cases of the Co2+/Zn2+ and
Ni2+/Zn2+ mixed aqueous solutions, the metal
adsorption capacities of each metal ion per gram of the adsorbent
were 0.337 mmol-Co2+/0.606 mmol-Zn2+ and 0.351
mmol-Ni2+/0.559 mmol-Zn2+, respectively. Cu2+ was selectively adsorbed in the presence of Co2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+, as in the previous two-metal-ion
mixed adsorption tests. From the above results, the order of metal
ion selectivity of the fibrous grafted metal adsorbent with the PZ-DTC
group was Co2+ ≈ Ni2+ < Zn2+ ≪ Cu2+. It was also observed that the fibrous
grafted metal adsorbent with the PZ-DTC group exhibited specific selectivity
for Cu2+. The above results revealed that the fibrous grafted
metal adsorbent having the PZ-DTC group could efficiently and selectively
recover heavy metal ions from an aqueous solution in which multiple
metal ions coexisted. In particular, the adsorbent with the PZ-DTC
group exhibited high affinity for Cu2+ and Pb2+.

Cu2+ Adsorption Capacity under Highly Alkaline Condition
Finally, the Cu2+ adsorption capacity of the fibrous
grafted metal adsorbent with the PZ-DTC group under a highly alkaline
condition was examined through the batchwise adsorption test. In this
Cu2+ adsorption tests, a 100 ppm Cu2+ aqueous
solution adjusted to pH 15 with 10 M NaOH was used, and the result
is summarized in Table 5. For comparison, the results of fibrous grafted metal adsorbents
with other functional groups such as diol (Diol), sulfonic acid (SA),
iminodiacetic acid (IDA), ethylenediamine (EDA), and iminodiethanol
groups (IDE) are listed in Table 5. The Diol-, SA-, IDA-, EDA-, and IDE-type adsorbents
were synthesized according to previously reported methods by Kim et
al., Ogawa et al., Dafader et al., Sekine et al., and Ozawa et al.,
respectively.42−46

Table 5 Cu2+ Adsorption Capacity
of Various Fibrous Grafted Metal Adsorbents under Highly Alkaline
Condition (pH 15)
adsorbent type	functional
group density [mmol/g-adsorbent]	Cu2+ adsorption capacity [mmol-Cu2+/g-adsorbent]	
PZ-DTC-type	2.112	0.754	
Diol-type	4.496	0.000	
SA-type	2.768	0.005	
IDA-type	2.172	0.082	
EDA-type	3.005	0.128	
IDE-type	3.015	0.314	
In this batchwise adsorption test, a marginal amount of Cu2+ was dissolved in a high-concentration NaOH aqueous solution
in order to adjust the pH to 15. The molar concentrations of Na+ and Cu2+ in the 100 ppm Cu2+ aqueous
solution at pH 15 corresponded to 10 M and 1.573 mM, respectively.
Therefore, the Na+ concentration was approximately 6400
times higher than the Cu2+ concentration, and the fibrous
grafted metal adsorbents were compelled to selectively adsorb a marginal
amount of Cu2+ from the solution with the high concentration
of Na+. As illustrated in Table 5, the Diol-type adsorbent could not adsorb
Cu2+. This was expected because the diol group is a hydrophilic
group and has no metal ion adsorption capability. Similarly, the SA-type
adsorbent could hardly adsorb Cu2+ selectively from a high-concentration
Na+ aqueous solution at pH 15. The Cu2+ adsorption
capacity per gram of the SA-type adsorbent under a highly alkaline
condition (pH 15) was 0.005 mmol-Cu2+/g-adsorbent. This
exceptionally low Cu2+ adsorption capacity of the SA-type
adsorbent was considered to be because the SA group, whose metal ion
selectivity was generally low, adsorbed metal ions by electrostatic
interaction.

Meanwhile, in the case of the metal adsorbent with
chelating functional
groups such as PZ-DTC, IDA, EDA, and IDE groups, although each chelate-type
adsorbent could selectively adsorb Cu2+ even from a high-concentration
Na+ aqueous solution at pH 15, the Cu2+ adsorption
capacities varied substantially depending on the type of chelate groups.
The IDA- and EDA-type adsorbents could selectively remove a trace
amount of Cu2+, which was dissolved in a high-concentration
Na+ aqueous solution at pH 15. The Cu2+ adsorption
capacities per gram of the IDA- and EDA-type adsorbents under a highly
alkaline condition (pH 15) were 0.082 and 0.128 mmol-Cu2+/g-adsorbent, respectively. In addition, the Cu2+ adsorption
capacity of the IDE-type adsorbent, which was used to clean the highly
alkaline etching aqueous solution of Si wafer and exhibited the highest
performance in a previous study, at pH 15, was approximately 0.314
mmol-Cu2+/g-adsorbent. The reason for these lower Cu2+ adsorption capacities was considered to be that the constituent
atoms of IDA, EDA, and IDE groups contained oxygen and nitrogen atoms,
which exhibit a high affinity for Na+. Therefore, it is
considered that various chelate groups such as IDA, EDA, and IDE groups
could adsorb Cu2+ and Na+ simultaneously.

Meanwhile, in the case of the PZ-DTC-type adsorbent, the Cu2+ adsorption capacity at pH 15 improved dramatically, attaining
0.754 mmol-Cu2+/g-adsorbent. This was approximately 2.4
times higher than that of the IDE-type adsorbent, which had been the
highest level until then. The reason for this higher Cu2+ adsorption capacity was considered to be that the constituent atom
of the PZ-DTC group did not contain an oxygen atom (which exhibits
a high affinity for Na+) and contained a sulfur atom (which
exhibits a low affinity for Na+). Therefore, it is considered
that the PZ-DTC groups could preferentially adsorb Cu2+ while excluding Na+. Additionally, regarding the stability
of the adsorbent at pH 15, the PZ-DTC-type adsorbent was not physically
destroyed and the introduced PZ-DTC groups were not released from
the adsorbent, even after being immersed in the highly alkaline solution
at pH 15 for 1 week.

The above results revealed that the fibrous
grafted metal adsorbent
with the PZ-DTC group did not lose its metal adsorption function even
under a highly alkaline condition (pH 15). In addition, it was observed
that the PZ-DTC-type adsorbent could recover Cu2+ efficiently
and selectively from a high-concentration Na+ aqueous solution
at pH 15.

Conclusions
A novel metal adsorbent
with the PZ-DTC group for heavy metal ions
was developed by radiation-induced emulsion grafting of GMA onto PE/PP-NF
and subsequent chemical modifications involving amination with NBPZ,
deprotection with HCl, and dithiocarbamation with CS2.
In the amination step, when the metal adsorbent was synthesized through
NBPZ, self-cross-linking of PZ could be completely suppressed. Thereby,
the metal adsorbent exhibiting a practically sufficient PZ-DTC density
was obtained. The PZ-DTC density of the metal adsorbent synthesized
through NBPZ attained 2.122 mmol-PZ-DTC/g-adsorbent, which was approximately
6 times higher than that of the metal adsorbent synthesized through
PZ.

The metal adsorbent with the PZ-DTC group exhibited higher
adsorption
performance for heavy metal ions than for light metal ions and specific
selectivity for Pb2+ and Cu2+. In particular,
the Cu2+ adsorbing function of this adsorbent could function
even under a highly alkaline condition (pH 15). Moreover, it could
recover Cu2+ efficiently and selectively from a high-concentration
Na+ aqueous solution at pH 15. The Cu2+ adsorption
capacity of the adsorbent was approximately 2.4 times higher than
that of the metal adsorbent with the IDE group. Therefore, it is apparent
that the metal adsorbent with the PZ-DTC group synthesized by the
graft polymerization technique and subsequent chemical modifications
is a potential and long-life material for removing metal ions from
highly alkaline aqueous solution such as etching solutions for Si
wafer.

Experimental Section
Materials
PE/PP-NF was supplied
by Kurashiki Textile
Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (Osaka, Japan) and used as a trunk material
for the metal adsorbent. The average fiber diameter and the mass per
unit area of the PE/PP-NF were 13 μm and 62 g/m2,
respectively. GMA was purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry Co.,
Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Tween 20, which was used as a nonionic surfactant
for preparing the monomer emulsion, was obtained from Kanto Chemical
Co., Inc. (Tokyo). Dipotassium piperazine-1,4-bis(carbodithioate)
was obtained from Oriental Giken Co., Ltd. (Saitama, Japan). All the
other chemicals such as PZ, NBPZ, CS2, NaOH, HCl, methanol,
ethanol, n-propanol, n-butanol,
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), dimethylformamide (DMF), 1,4-dioxane (DOX),
inorganic metal salts, and so forth were also obtained from Kanto
Chemical. GMA and other reagents were of highest commercially available
purity and used as received without further purification. The water
used for monomer emulsions was purified with a Milli-Q deionization
system (Nihon Millipore K.K., Tokyo).

Synthesis of Fibrous Grafted
Metal Adsorbent with PZ-DTC Group
Radiation-Induced Emulsion
Grafting
The radiation-induced
emulsion grafting procedure was almost the same as in the previous
studies.18,28,45,47 The PE/PP-NF was cut into 3 × 3 cm square pieces.
These were placed in polyethylene bags. The air inside the polyethylene
bags was replaced with nitrogen gas. The PE/PP-NF samples were irradiated
to produce starting sites of the grafting with an electron beam at
a dose of 20 kGy. This electron beam irradiation was applied using
a low-energy electron accelerator (type: EC250/30/180LS, Iwasaki Electric
Co., Ltd., Tokyo) under the following conditions: an acceleration
voltage of 250 kV and an irradiation current of 2.7 mA. Then, the
irradiated PE/PP-NF samples were placed in a glass ampoule from which
air was evacuated immediately using a vacuum line. Subsequently, a
previously deaerated GMA emulsion (5 wt % GMA/0.5 wt % Tween20/94.5
wt % H2O) was drawn into the glass ampoule. The grafting
was carried out by keeping the glass ampoule in a thermostated water
bath at 40 °C for 1 h. After grafting, the GMA-grafted PE/PP-NF
(PE/PP-NF-g-GMA) samples were washed repeatedly with
methanol to remove the remaining nonreacted GMA and dried in vacuo.
The amount of GMA grafted onto PE/PP-NF was expressed in terms of
the Dg and was calculated by the following equation  where W0 and W1 are the weights of the PE/PP-NF before and
after grafting, respectively. Five parallel samples were grafted,
and the Dg value is reported as an average.

Chemical Modification through
PZ
The introduction of
the PZ-DTC group through PZ was carried out by a two-step chemical
modification. First, the PE/PP-NF-g-GMA sample was
aminated with a 0.5 M PZ solution at 80 °C for
24 h to introduce PZ groups into the GMA-graft chains of PE/PP-NF-g-GMA. After amination, the sample of PE/PP-NF-g-GMA (PE/PP-NF-g-GMA-PZ) to which the PZ groups
were introduced was washed repeatedly with deionized water to remove
the remaining nonreacted PZ. Secondly, the PE/PP-NF-g-GMA-PZ sample was treated further with a CS2 solution
(20 wt % CS2/35 wt % 10 M NaOH aqueous solution/45 wt %
methanol) at 40 °C for 24 h to introduce the DTC group at the
terminal nitrogen on the PZ group. After dithiocarbamation, the dithiocarbamated
PE/PP-NF-g-GMA-PZ (PE/PP-NF-g-GMA-PZ-DTC)
sample was washed repeatedly with methanol and deionized water to
eliminate the remaining nonreacted reagents. Then, it was dried in
vacuo to obtain the fibrous grafted metal adsorbent having the PZ-DTC
group, which is the objective of this study. The Da, PZ density, C-PZ
ratio, and PZ-DTC density are defined as follows        

where W2 and W3 are the weights of PE/PP-NF-g-GMA-PZ
and PE/PP-NF-g-GMA-PZ-DTC, respectively.
The numbers 142, 86, and 99 are the molecular weights of GMA, PZ,
and CS2-Na, respectively. In this study, because the CS2 treatment was carried out in a NaOH solution, the amount
of the final product (the metal adsorbent) was calculated based on
that of the sodium form.

Chemical Modification through NBPZ
The introduction
of the PZ-DTC group through NBPZ was carried out by a three-step chemical
modification. First, the PE/PP-NF-g-GMA sample was
aminated with a 0.25 M NBPZ aqueous solution at 80 °C for 4 h
to introduce NBPZ groups into the GMA-graft chains of PE/PP-NF-g-GMA. After the amination, the sample of PE/PP-NF-g-GMA to which the NBPZ groups were introduced (PE/PP-NF-g-GMA-NBPZ) was washed repeatedly with deionized water to
remove the remaining nonreacted NBPZ. Second, to deprotect the Boc
group functioning as a protecting group of NBPZ, the PE/PP-NF-g-GMA-NBPZ sample was treated with a 1 M HCl aqueous solution
at 80 °C for 2 h. It was then washed repeatedly with deionized
water. The Boc-deprotected PE/PP-NF-g-GMA-NBPZ sample
exhibited a structure identical to that of the PE/PP-NF-g-GMA-PZ sample. Third, the PE/PP-NF-g-GMA-PZ sample
was treated further with a CS2 solution at 40 °C for
24 h to introduce the DTC group at the terminal nitrogen on the PZ
group, following the procedure in the chemical modification through
PZ. After dithiocarbamation, the PE/PP-NF-g-GMA-PZ-DTC
sample was washed repeatedly with methanol and deionized water and
then dried in vacuo to obtain the objective fibrous grafted metal
adsorbent with the PZ-DTC group. The Da, NBPZ density, Dd, and PZ-DTC
density are defined as follows        where W4, W5, and W6 are the
weights of PE/PP-NF-g-GMA-NBPZ, PE/PP-NF-g-GMA-PZ, and PE/PP-NF-g-GMA-PZ-DTC, respectively.
The numbers 142, 186, 86, and 99 are the molecular weights of GMA,
NBPZ, PZ, and CS2-Na, respectively.

Metal Absorption
Tests
The metal adsorption capacity
and selectivity of the synthesized fibrous grafted metal adsorbent
with the PZ-DTC group was evaluated through batchwise adsorption tests.
In this study, 12 types of metal ions (B(OH)4–, Mg2+, Ca2+, Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Sr2+, Cd2+, Ba2+, and Pb2+) were used
as the target elements. To evaluate the saturated metal adsorption
capacity of each metal ion, a metal ion aqueous solution containing
a single element was used. To evaluate the metal ion selectivity of
the fibrous grafted metal adsorbent with the PZ-DTC group, a metal
ion aqueous solution containing two elements (e.g., Na+/Pb2+ and Co2+/Ni2+) was used. The
adsorption tests of the single metal ions and the binary mixed metal
ions were conducted at pH 6. To evaluate the metal
adsorption capacity under a highly alkaline condition, a Cu2+ aqueous solution adjusted to pH 15 was used.

Approximately
25 mg of fibrous grafted metal adsorbent was immersed in 100 mL of
various metal ion aqueous solutions of 100 ppm for 24 h at room temperature
with the stirring rate maintained at 300 rpm. After 24 h, the fibrous
grafted metal adsorbent was removed from the metal ion aqueous solution,
and the concentration of the remaining metal ion in each solution
was measured using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission
spectrometer (ICP-OES) (model Optima 8300, Perkin-Elmer Inc.). Before
and after adsorption tests, the metal ion aqueous solutions were filtered
through a membrane filter with a 0.2 micrometer pore size in order
to remove the precipitates. The metal adsorption capacity (mmol/g-adsorbent)
of the synthesized fibrous grafted metal adsorbent was calculated
by the following equation  where C0 and C are the initial and
final concentrations (ppm), respectively,
of the metal ion in the aqueous phase; V is the volume
of the metal ion aqueous solution (mL); Awmetal is the
atomic weight of each metal ion (mol/g); and Wadsorbent is the mass of the fibrous grafted metal adsorbent
(mg).
