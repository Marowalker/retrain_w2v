We
have investigated a Z-scheme
based on a ZnO/Pt/CdZnS photocatalyst, active in the presence of a
complex medium composed of acetic acid and benzyl alcohol, the effects
of which on the catalyst stability and performance are studied. Transmission
electron microscopy images showed uniformly dispersed sub-nanometer
Pt particles. Inductively coupled plasma and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
analyses suggested that Pt is sandwiched between ZnO and CdZnS. An
apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 34% was obtained over the [ZnO]4/1 wt %Pt/CdZnS system at 360 nm, 2.5-fold higher than that
of 1%Pt/CdZnS (14%). Furthermore, an AQY of 16% was observed using
[ZnO]4/1 wt %Pt/CdZnS, which was comparable to that of
1 wt %Pt/CdZnS (10%) at 460 nm. On the basis of these results, we
proposed a charge transfer mechanism, which was confirmed through
femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. Finally, we identified
the two main factors that affected the stability of the catalyst,
which were the sacrificial reagent and the acidic pH.

1 Introduction
Photocatalytic
water splitting for hydrogen production employing
semiconductor-based photocatalysts is considered to be the “Holy
Grail” of solar energy conversion and storage.1 However, this photocatalytic process is largely limited
by four factors: (1) stability with respect to photocorrosion, (2)
a narrow band gap of the photocatalysts to absorb more light and suitable
band edges/maximum–minimum, which match with the redox potential/level
of water, (3) environmental friendliness, and (4) easy access and
cost-effectiveness. These four conditions are often mutually exclusive
for practical applications. Furthermore, fast charge recombination
of the photocatalysts seriously reduces the solar-to-fuel conversion
efficiency.2 Therefore, it is almost impossible
to find a single semiconductor photocatalyst that satisfies all of
these requirements. For instance, ZnO is the preferred material for
the photoelectrode in hydrogen production. However, it has an energy
band gap of about ∼3.2 eV; therefore, it mostly absorbs the
ultraviolet portion of the solar spectrum, which is less than 5% of
total solar energy. As an alternative, cadmium sulfide-based narrow
band gap semiconductors, such as CdxZn1–xS, also have been extensively investigated
due to their band gap tunability, and better charge mobility compare
to those of CdS.3 The photocatalytic activity
of various morphologies of CdxZn1–xS, including nanoparticles,4 nanotwins,5 nanoflowers,6 and volvoxlike structures,7 was
investigated. Despite the suitable band gap and high quantum efficiency,
these types of CdS-based photocatalysts suffer from catalytic decay
even with sacrificial reagents because the sulfide is easily oxidized
to elemental sulfur by photogenerated holes. Therefore, effective
removal of holes from CdS-based light absorbers is the key for long-term
stability of this type of photocatalysts. Nevertheless, these limitations
of CdS-based single semiconductors can be mitigated by designing a
heterogeneous p–n junction system. A p–n junction is
a boundary or interface between p-type and n-type semiconductors,
which improves charge separation through band bending. However, in
this process, the redox potentials of electrons and holes are reduced;8 as a result, it is impossible to obtain a system
that has higher charge separation as well as higher or suitable redox
potentials simultaneously. Therefore, it is necessary to explore new
types of multijunction photocatalysts that can overcome the drawbacks
of a p–n junction system. The actual solution for this problem
can be found in nature; for instance, plants use a Z-scheme photocatalytic
process to convert H2O and CO2 into carbohydrate
and O2, which is a two-step photoexcitation process.1,9 In step 1, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) electrons
of an oxygen-evolving complex (photosystem II, PS II) are excited
to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of PS II under solar
light and then the electrons in LUMO of PS II are transferred to the
HOMO of ferredoxin-NAPD reductase (PS I), through the electron mediator.
In step 2, the HOMO (photosystem I, PS I) electrons of PS I are excited
to its LUMO (PS I). As a result, the photogenerated electrons and
holes are left in the LUMO (PS I) and the HOMO (PS II), respectively.
Finally, the photogenerated electrons in the LUMO (PS I) are used
to reduce CO2, whereas the photogenerated holes in the
HOMO of PS II are used to oxidize H2O. In light of that,
artificial Z-scheme-based photocatalytic systems have been widely
investigated.10 The nature-mimicked Z-scheme
photocatalytic system not only shows high redox potentials but also
has a slow charge recombination rate in addition to enhanced light
absorption.9b Despite their limitations
as mentioned above as single semiconductors, ZnO and CdxZn1–xS together
can form an efficient Z-scheme system due to their compatible lattice
structures and suitable band gap alignment, which lead to excellent
charge migration through the interface and consequently facilitate
the effective interband charge transfer from CdxZn1–xS to ZnO.11 Recently, Rao et al. have reported [ZnO]4/1%Pt/Cd0.8Zn0.2S heterojunction structures
that show a high quantum yield under visible light.12 However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no systematic
studies on this particular photocatalyst in terms of the charge transfer
mechanism and stability due to the complexity of the system. Therefore,
we used ZnO/Pt/CdZnS as a model system to perform a detailed analysis
on the Z-scheme.

In this work, we first synthesized and characterized
ZnO/Pt/Cd0.8Zn0.2S and its two main components,
Pt/ZnO and
Pt/Cd0.8Zn0.2S, and performed detailed analysis
of their contributions to the photocatalytic activity of ZnO/Pt/Cd0.8Zn0.2S. Then, we studied the effect of Pt content
on the overall photoactivities of ZnO/Pt/Cd0.8Zn0.2S and evaluated the factors that affect the stability of this type
of photocatalysts. In addition, we also investigated charge carrier
dynamics using femtosecond transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy.
Finally, we proposed the possible charge transfer mechanism and verified
experimentally the proposed Z-scheme.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Characterization
The X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns of various catalysts are depicted in Figure 1. The ZnO/Pt/CdZnS hybrid system
shows a clear mixture of hexagonal ZnO and cubic Cd0.8Zn0.2S phases. The three diffraction peaks of all of the Cd0.8Zn0.2S-based materials with 2θ; values
of 26.9, 44.6, and 52.8° represent the (111), (220), and (311)13 planes of the zinc-blend phase, respectively.
All peaks are broad due to the high content of Cd in the solid solution,
which causes a significant increase of unit cell parameters because
of large differences of their ion radius (Cd2+(0.78 Å)
and Zn2+(0.68 Å))14 and
small particle sizes (<10 nm) of each component, as shown by transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) images (Figure 3). Because the solid solution of Cd0.8Zn0.2S was synthesized at low temperature (60 °C),
the main crystal composition is a zinc-blend cubic phase (Figure 1). Similar results
were reported by Chen et al.,14 where a
minor wurtzite phase starts to appear once the Cd content is higher
than 48% in CdxZn1–xS solid solution when the system was synthesized
at low temperature. The two small shoulder peaks at 25.3 and 28.5°
in Figure 1, corresponding
to the (100) and (101) crystal planes of wurtzite, indicate a mixed
phase in the solid solutions (Cd0.8Zn0.2S and
1%Pt/Cd0.8Zn0.2S), but it is not obvious in
the case of the hybrid system ([ZnO]4/1%Pt/Cd0.8Zn0.2S). However, high-resolution TEM images of [ZnO]4/0.1%Pt/Cd0.8Zn0.2S (Figure 3) show some wurtzite hexagonal
phases of Cd0.8Zn0.2S. Therefore, one can conclude
that both the solid solution and the hybrid system are formed by mixed
phases but the dominant phase is the zinc-blended phase. Because lattice
parameters of cubic CdxZn1–xS solid solutions follow Vergard’s law,15 which describes
a linear relationship between x and lattice parameters,
the Cd contents (x) were calculated according to eq 1. 1  Here, a(CdxZn1–xS) is the lattice parameter
of the CdxZn1–xS solid solution, a(CdS) and a(ZnS) are the lattice parameters of CdS and ZnS, respectively, and x is the molar fraction of Cd in the solution. The Cd contents
in the solid solutions were calculated to be 0.78 ± 0.02. Because
the error is less than 3%, the Cd content is assumed to be the same
in all of the cases as 0.8. All of the characteristic peaks of Cd0.8Zn0.2S, whether alone or with ZnO, show a clear
shift toward a higher angle, indicating the formation of a solid solution.
The crystal sizes of ZnO plus Cd0.8Zn0.2S both
in separate and mixed phases in the Z-scheme are calculated according
to Scherrer’s equation. The results show that the crystal sizes
of ZnO and Cd0.8Zn0.2S are the same in both
conditions, which are around 10 and 6 nm, respectively.

systems:

The optical band gaps
of the Cd0.8Zn0.2S-based
systems were determined by the Tauc plot;16 the optical band gap (Eg) can be obtained
in the wavelength range 450–750 nm from the straight line plot
between (αhυ)1/2 (α
is the absorption coefficient) and photon energy (hυ). There are slight differences in the Eg, as shown in Figure 2, which could be associated with slight differences of Cd
concentration in the solid solution during sample preparation. The Eg of the Cd0.8Zn0.2S-based
hybrid systems were found to be between 2.2 and 2.3 eV (Figure 2, inset).

Figure 3 shows the TEM images
of an overall view of as-prepared
[ZnO]4/Pt/Cd0.8Zn0.2S, which is constituted
by small particles, quite homogeneous in size. An enlargement of the
area inside the square in Figure 3a shows a very homogeneous distribution of particles
with an average particle size of 5 nm (Cd0.8Zn0.2S), which is slightly smaller than that estimated by XRD (Figure 1). It is interesting
to note, however, that particles with different crystallinities are
seen, ranging from almost amorphous to very well faceted ones. This
is particularly visible in the insets of the Fourier transform (FT)
image of the particle in Figure 3b. The spots at 3.36 and 3.16 Å correspond well
to the (002) and (101) crystallographic planes of hexagonal Cd0.8Zn0.2S, whereas the spots at 2.72 and 3.14 Å
represent the (200) and (111) planes of the cubic crystal phase, respectively.
Furthermore, the (101) plane of hexagonal ZnO is also observed. In Figure 3c, the several small
particles with high electron contrast (marked by white arrows) can
be ascribed to a Pt-containing phase. They are subnanometric and very
well dispersed. HAADF-STEM was performed to study the microstructure
of the catalyst. The EDX analysis shows strong signals of Zn, Cd,
and S; they are likely the mixed phases of ZnO and Cd0.8Zn0.2S. Both phases are extremely well mixed. Figure 1S shows the X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) survey spectra of 0.1%Pt/Cd0.8Zn0.2S, 1%Pt/Cd0.8Zn0.2S, [ZnO]4/0.1%Pt/Cd0.8Zn0.2S, and [ZnO]4/1%Pt/Cd0.8Zn0.2S, which confirm the coexistence
of Cd, Zn, S, and Pt. The binding energies of Cd 3d5/2,
Zn 2p3/2, S 2p3/2, and O 1s are recorded in Table 1 with the corresponding
references.

The range of binding energies of
Zn 2p3/2 of all of
the samples are between 1022.2 ± 0.2 eV
and they are close to each other which are similar to that reported
for ZnO17 and ZnS18 (Figure 4d). Therefore,
establishing an accurate assignment for both Zn2+(ZnO) and Zn2+(ZnS) is difficult. However,
the presence of metal oxide can be verified by analyzing the chemical
states of oxygen in the system. For example, the O 1s peaks from Pt/Cd0.8Zn0.2S and ZnO/Pt/Cd0.8Zn0.2S show three oxygen species in different chemical environments, where
the peaks at ∼530.0, 531.5, and 533.0 eV are ascribed to Zn–O, CH3O–H (−OH) (from solvent), and H–O–H, respectively19 (Figure S2). Interestingly, the surface-adsorbed
water is only detected on the surface of a nonhybrid system such as
0.1%Pt/Cd0.8Zn0.2S and 1%Pt/Cd0.8Zn0.2S. Furthermore, the signal intensity of Zn–O became much weaker in the case of ZnO/1%Pt/Cd0.8Zn0.2S compared to that of ZnO/0.1%Pt/Cd0.8Zn0.2S, which can be interpreted in terms of encapsulation
of ZnO by Cd0.8Zn0.2S in the hybrid systems.
The S 2p3/2 peaks of the samples are close to 161.0 eV,
characteristic of the presence of S2– species on
the surface20 (Figure 4a). Furthermore, no other sulfur species
are detected, which indicates that S2– species were
not oxidized during the synthesis.

(a) S 2p, (b) Pt 4f, (c) Cd 3d, and (d) Zn 2p.

The peaks at around 404.7 eV in Figure 4c correspond to Cd 3d5/2 and are
ascribed to Cd–S bonds.7 The binding
energies of Pt 4f 7/2 of the samples are almost identical
(Figure 4b). In general,
the Pt 4f 7/2 binding energy of bulk metal platinum is
around 71.1 eV, whereas the binding energy of Pt 4f 7/2 increases with decreasing the particle size of Pt.21,22 Then, the binding energy of Pt 4f7/2 recorded at 72.0
eV indicates the presence of very small Pt particles on the surface,
in accordance with high-resolution TEM (Figure 3). Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) and XPS
analyses suggest that Pt may be sandwiched between ZnO and Cd(Zn)S.
This is because 1 wt % Pt, detected by ICP and TEM, is not detectable
by XPS in the same hybrid system, even though XPS could detect concentrations
down to 0.1 wt % Pt in the absence of ZnO (the nonhybrid system, Figure 4b).

2.2 Photocatalytic Tests
Photocatalytic
hydrogen generation was evaluated at 42.5 mW/cm2 using
an aqueous solution of benzyl alcohol and acetic acid (2.5–2.5%
v/v) as a sacrificial reagent, which was reported to yield high quantum
yields.12 The pH of the solution was 2.5. Figure 5 shows a comparison
of the photocatalytic hydrogen generation activity of the as-prepared
samples. The highest hydrogen production rate was achieved for [ZnO]4/1%Pt/Cd0.8 Zn0.2S, which is likely
due to the effect of the Z-scheme between ZnO and Cd0.8Zn0.2S through Pt. No H2 was detected when
Pt/ZnO alone was used even after 5 h of irradiation, suggesting that
ZnO was not stable at pH = 2.5. However, ZnO/Pt/Cd0.8Zn0.2S showed good stability and better activity under such a
condition due to the encapsulation of ZnO by Cd0.8Zn0.2S. To study the effect of each component of ZnO/Pt/Cd0.8Zn0.2S on the Z-scheme, different combinations
of ZnO, Pt, and Cd0.8Zn0.2S were prepared (Pt/ZnO
and Pt/Cd0.8Zn0.2S). The hydrogen generation
activities in the broad light spectrum (360–700 nm) and the
corresponding quantum yields at 365 and 460 nm were compared to those
of ZnO/Pt/Cd0.8Zn0.2S. Both ZnO/Pt/Cd0.8Zn0.2S and Pt/Cd0.8Zn0.2S showed
much higher hydrogen generation rates than those of Cd0.8Zn0.2S regardless of the quantity of Pt. This could arise
from the increase in the charge-separation efficiency because of the
electron transfer from the semiconductor to Pt. In addition, the photocatalytic
activity of [ZnO]4/1%Pt/Cd0.8Zn0.2S was around 50% higher than that of 1%Pt/Cd0.8Zn0.2S, which highlights the positive contribution of ZnO to
the photoactivity. To quantify the actual contribution of ZnO, the
apparent quantum yields (AQYs) of both photocatalysts were measured
using the same quantities present in the hybrid system (Table 2). For instance, the maximum
hydrogen generation rate
of [ZnO]4/1%Pt/Cd0.8Zn0.2S was obtained
with 33 mg of catalyst in 30 mL of sacrificial reagent (33 mg cat/30
mL sac.), which contain 10 mg of Cd0.8Zn0.2S
and 23 mg of ZnO, respectively. The result reveals that when the catalysts
were illuminated at 365 nm, where both ZnO and Cd0.8Zn0.2S were activated at the same time, the AQY of [ZnO]4/1%Pt/Cd0.8Zn0.2S (33 mg/30 mL) was
over 2 times higher than that of 1%Pt/Cd0.8Zn0.2S (10 mg/30 mL), whereas 1%Pt/ZnO was not producing any hydrogen.
Therefore, it can be concluded that the [ZnO]4/1%Pt/Cd0.8Zn0.2S hybrid system follows a Z-scheme mechanism
at 365 nm, as shown in Figure 6a. In this case, the Z-scheme simultaneously generates valence
band (VB)-holes on ZnO with a higher oxidation potential and conduction
band (CB)-electrons on Cd0.8Zn0.2S with a higher
reduction potential compared to those of ZnO and Cd0.8Zn0.2S. Consequently, the maximum redox potentials of the hybrid
system were utilized, thus resulting in higher photocatalytic activities.
Interestingly, a significantly higher AQY was also obtained by ZnO4/1%Pt/Cd0.8Zn0.2S compared to that of
1%Pt/Cd0.8Zn0.2S when both catalysts were illuminated
at 460 nm (Table 2).
Although only the Cd0.8Zn0.2S portion of [ZnO]4/1%Pt/Cd0.8Zn0.2S was exited at 460
nm, a higher AQY was achieved likely because the photogenerated electrons
from CB of Cd0.8Zn0.2S were relocated to the
CB of ZnO and then transferred to Pt, resulting in a better charge
separation, which in turn leads to a higher activity. A similar phenomenon
was reported on various hybrid materials.23 In contrast, deactivations were observed at both 365 and 460 nm
when the [ZnO]4/0.1%Pt/Cd0.8Zn0.2S versus the 0.1%Pt/Cd0.8Zn0.2S (Table 2) which implies the importance
of Pt content in the hybrid system. Apparently, the amount of Pt needs
to be optimized for constructing an efficient Z-scheme. The effect
of Pt on the Z-scheme is currently subjecting to a further study.

Accordingly, we proposed the charge transfer
mechanisms for both
cases separately, as shown in Figure 6. The overall solar-driven Z-scheme involves four steps,
as
described in Figure 6a. The steps are as follows: (1) charge generation in ZnO and Cd0.8Zn0.2S, (2) charge recombination on Pt, (3) oxidation
of the sacrificial reagent on the VB of ZnO, and (4) hydrogen generation
on the CB of Cd0.8Zn0.2S. This process happens
only when both semiconductors are activated at the same time. On the
other hand, simple charge transfer happens when only Cd0.8Zn0.2S is excited, as shown in Figure 6b. The charge transfer process is also associated
with four steps: (1) Cd0.8Zn0.2S excitation,
(2) electron transfer from
Cd0.8Zn0.2S to ZnO and then to Pt, (3) photo-oxidation
on Cd0.8Zn0.2S, and (4) photoreduction on Pt.
In summary, the Z-scheme (Figure 6a) is formed under UV + vis light, whereas charge separation
(Figure 6b) occurs
under visible light on ZnO/1%Pt/Cd(Zn)S.

To further validate
the proposed mechanism, femtosecond transient
absorption (TA) measurements were performed on ZnO, ZnO/Pt, Cd0.8Zn0.2S, Cd0.8Zn0.2S/Pt,
and ZnO/Pt/Cd0.8Zn0.2S following 350 nm excitation,
as shown in Figure 7A. The details of TA spectra are described in Figure 7A, where the spectral signatures were identified
for both electrons and holes for ZnO and Cd0.8Zn0.2S. The spectral features of Cd0.8Zn0.2S in
terms of peak shapes and positions are similar to those observed in
CdS24 and are assigned in the same manner.
The TA feature around 420 nm decays rapidly, which can be attributed
to hot excitons in Cd0.8Zn0.2S.25 This feature disappeared in Cd0.8Zn0.2S/Pt due to fast electron transfer from Cd0.8Zn0.2S to Pt. The transient bleach (TB) around 470 nm shows slow decay,
indicating the domination of the long-lived single exciton state,
and it is attributed to the filling of the electron level,25 which is broadened when Pt is attached to Cd0.8Zn0.2S. Meanwhile, a fast TB feature at 610 nm
appears, suggesting electron transfer from CB of Cd0.8Zn0.2S to Pt.26 A similar feature
at a slightly different position (615 nm) was also observed in the
case of ZnO/Pt, further indicating that Pt nanoparticles are the main
exciton quenching pathway.25 In addition,
the broad TB features at 392 and 460 nm are attributed to electron
absorption from shallow trap (ST) states of ZnO, whereas the broad
photoinduced absorption (PA) peak at 538 nm can be assigned to hole
absorption in ZnO/Pt. It is interesting to note that only one long-lived
and high-energy exciton band was observed at 365 nm in pristine ZnO,
representing a band absorption of 3.2 eV, which resulted into electrons
and holes in the presence of Pt.

kinetic decay traces of ZnO, Pt/ZnO, and ZnO/Pt/Cd0.8Zn0.2S in 0.5 mg/mL water suspension following 350 nm excitation
with 90 μJ/cm2.

Although TB signals at 470 and 610 nm of Cd0.8Zn0.2S are stronger, they overlapped with those of ZnO/Pt
around
the same region, making it difficult to analyze (Figure 7A). Therefore, the TB feature
at 390 nm and PA at 538 nm of ZnO were chosen to monitor the effect
of Z-scheme (Figure 7B). All of the transient features of ZnO/Pt, ZnO/Pt/Cd0.8Zn0.2S at various wavelengths were fitted with biexponential
and the relevant fitted parameters are summarized in Table 3. The electron feature
of ZnO/Pt/Cd0.8Zn0.2S at 392 nm shows faster
decay compared to that of ZnO/Pt, whereas the hole feature at 538
nm displays a negligible change in both ZnO/Pt/Cd0.8Zn0.2S and ZnO/Pt (Figure 7B). This indicates faster depopulation of ST electron of ZnO
through Z-scheme. According to the proposed mechanism, as shown in Figure 6, the electron generated
on ZnO was quenched with the hole generated on Cd0.8Zn0.2S through Pt, which resulted in faster electron decay compared
to that of ZnO/Pt. On the other hand, the lifetime of the hole is
not affected that much. Consequently, this process made it possible
for the electron from Cd0.8Zn0.2S and the hole
from ZnO to participate in redox reactions. This kind of carrier dynamics
features agrees well with the description of Z-scheme, as shown in Figure 6.

The stability of the photocatalyst is considered
to be the most
important factor for practical applications. To investigate the stability
of the ZnO/Pt/Cd0.8Zn0.2S system, the time dependency
of the photocatalytic H2 production over [ZnO]4/0.1%Pt/Cd0.8Zn0.2S from an aqueous solution
containing 2.5–2.5% BnOH–CH3CO2H at 23% light intensity (42.5 mW/cm2) of a xenon lamp
was performed. The initial pH of the sacrificial reagent was around
2.5. The results (Figure 8) show that the H2 generation rate declines continuously
and then stops completely after 2500 min.

H2 production with
[ZnO]4/0.1%Pt/Cd0.8Zn0.2S. The reactor
volume (137 mL), amounts of catalyst (6 mg) and total flux (42.5 mW/cm2).

Although the catalysts aggregated
physically after a prolonged
time, there was no color change of the catalyst. Furthermore, a similar
H2 generation rate was obtained after washing the used
catalyst with ethanol. This phenomenon suggests that benzyl aldehyde
(BzCHO) which was quantified by GC-MS, as one of the reaction intermediates,
is strongly adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst, subsequently
inhibiting the photocatalytic reaction. Moreover, the XPS analysis
of catalysts before and after the reaction (Table 4) reveals a change of Cd/Zn ratio from 1:2.7
to 1:1.6. This could be due to Zn leaching during H2 generation,
owing to the acidic nature of the sacrificial reagent.

Fresh and Used Catalyst by ICP and XPS

fresh	1:4.7	0.1	1:2.7	 	
used	1:1	0.2	1:1.6	 	
According to the experimental results and visual observation, one
can conclude that the two main reasons for the deactivation of the
photocatalyst are strong adsorption of BzCHO and dissolution of ZnO.

3 Conclusions
In summary, a uniformly dispersed
ZnO/Pt/Cd0.8Zn0.2S photocatalyst exhibits high
photocatalytic
activity for
hydrogen production when 2.5–2.5% v/v BnOH/CH3CO2H was used as the sacrificial reagent under xenon lamp irradiation
(total light flux: 42.5 mW/cm2). In particular, the highest
photocatalytic rate (10.2 mmol/h g) and AQY (34%) were achieved with
[ZnO]4/1%Pt/Cd0.8Zn0.2S, which are
significantly higher than those of 1%Pt/ZnO and 1%Pt/Cd0.8Zn0.2S. These results are attributed to the effective
Z-scheme formation between ZnO and Cd0.8Zn0.2S through Pt. A Z-scheme-based charge transfer mechanism was proposed
by performing a time-resolved transient absorption study. Finally,
a systematic study was conducted on the photocatalytic stability of
the system. The results indicate that there are two main reasons for
catalytic deactivation of ZnO/Pt/Cd0.8Zn0.2S,
namely, (1) blockage of active sites caused by strong adsorption of
BzCHO and (2) ZnO dissolution under acidic conditions, which will
eventually destroy the Z-scheme. This work not only represents a systematic
study on the ZnO/Pt/Cd0.8Zn0.2S system but also
provides new insights into the understanding of photocatalytic activities
of metal oxide/metal/Cd(Zn)S hybrid systems.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Synthesis of ZnO/Pt/CdZnS
All reagents
were of analytical grade, purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and used without
further purification. The detailed synthetic procedure used for preparing
Cd0.8Zn0.2S-based hybrid materials is described
below.12

4.1.1 Pt/ZnO12
Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O (2.64 g, 12
mmol) was added to methanol (210 mL) in a 500 mL three-neck RBF, and
the temperature was raised to 60 °C. After 10 min, 30 mL of a
methanolic solution of KOH
(1.50 g, 26.7 mmol) was added dropwise to the reaction solution. The
clear solution was stirred for another 2 h at 60 °C and then
50 mL of water was added. The resulting white precipitate was filtered,
washed with water–methanol (1:1), and dried at 80°C for
overnight to give ZnO in quantitative yield. H4PtCl6 (1 mg Pt/mL, 12 mL) was added dropwise to a methanol solution
of ZnO (1 g, 12.3 mmol) nanocrystals, followed by 1.5 mL of NaBH4 (40 mM) aqueous solution. The solution was stirred for 10
min. The resulting suspension was centrifuged, washed with methanol,
and dried in air to give Pt@ZnO in quantitative yield.

4.1.2 ZnO/Pt/Cd0.8Zn0.2S12
ZnO/Pt (0.32 g, 4 mmol) nanoparticles
were dispersed in 70 mL of methanol, and the temperature was raised
to 60 °C. To form Cd0.8Zn0.2S layers on
the particles, the required amount of zinc acetate (0.2 mmol) from
zinc acetate stock solution (80 mM, 2.5 mL) and cadmium acetate (0.8
mmol) from its stock
solution (80 mM, 10 mL) were added to the suspension, the suspension
was stirred for 15 min at 60 °C, and then sodium sulfide (2 mmol)
from the (100 mM, 20 mL) methanolic stock solution was added dropwise.
The resulting suspension was stirred for 1 h. The precipitates were
separated by centrifugation, washed with H2O/MeOH (1:1)
mixture, and dried at 80 °C overnight to give the final product
of [ZnO]4/1%Pt/Cd0.8Zn0.2S (0.4 g,
88% in yield).

4.1.3 Pt/Cd0.8Zn0.2S
Zinc acetate (0.2 mmol) from zinc acetate stock
solution (80 mM,
2.5 mL) and cadmium acetate (0.8 mmol) from its (80 mM, 10 mL) stock
solution were mixed, the mixture was stirred for 15 min at 60 °C,
and then sodium sulfide (2 mmol) from (100 mM, 20 mL) methanolic stock
solution was added dropwise. The resulting suspension was stirred
for 1 h. The precipitates were separated by centrifugation, washed
with the H2O/MeOH (1:1) mixture, and dried at 60 °C
overnight to give the final product of Cd0.8Zn0.2S in quantitative yield. Photodeposition of Pt on Cd0.8Zn0.2S was carried out by mixing of Cd0.8Zn0.2S (100 mg) with 1 mL of stock solution of H4PtCl6 (1 mg/mL (Pt)) in BnOH/AcOH (2.5–2.5% v/v). The resulting
mixture was illuminated under UV (λ = 360 nm) light with the
intensity of 5 mW/cm2 for 4 h. The resulting solution was
filtered, washed with water, and dried at 80 °C overnight to
obtain the desired product 1%Pt/Cd0.8Zn0.2S
in quantitative yield.

4.2 Characterization
UV–vis absorption
spectra of the powdered catalysts were collected over the wavelength
range of 250–700 nm on a Thermo Fisher Scientific spectrophotometer
equipped with praying mantis diffuse reflectance accessory. Absorbance
(A) and reflectance (% R) of the
samples were measured. The reflectance (% R) data
were used to calculate the band gap of the samples using the Tauc
plot (Kubelka–Munk function).

XRD spectra were recorded
using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer. Cu Kα (λ
= 1.5406 Å) radiation over the range of 2θ; interval between
20 and 90° with a step size of 0.010° and a step time of
0.2 s/step was used.

The XP spectra of the samples were collected
by a Thermo Scientific
Escalab 250 XI XP spectrometer with an Al Kα X-ray source. The
X-ray spot size was 650 × 650 μm2. Charge compensation
was carried out using a standard flood gun. Before collecting XPS
data, samples were etched using Ar ions for 5 min at an ion energy
of 1000 eV. Data were acquired using the settings given in Table 5.

Table 5 XPS Setting for Date Acquisition
scan	PE (eV)	dwell time
(ms)	step size
(eV)	# of scans	
survey	100	100	1	1	
high resolution	30	100	0.1	10–30	
All peaks
were corrected with respect to the binding energy of
the adventitious C 1s peak at 284.5 eV. All peaks were fitted using
the SMART background option and Lorentzian/Gaussian.

The concentrations
of Zn, Cd, S, and Pt were measured by inductively
coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy on a Varian 720-ES instrument.
TEM samples were dispersed in alcohol, and a drop of the suspension
was placed over a grid with holey-carbon film. The TEM images were
collected using a FEI Tecnai F20 microscope operating at 200 kV.

4.3 Photocatalytic Test
Photocatalytic
reactions were performed in a 137 mL volume Pyrex glass reactor using
6–30 mg of catalyst. Various volume ratios (30 mL) of benzyl
alcohol/acidic acid (BnOH/AcOH) aqueous solutions were used. The slurry
was purged with N2 gas to remove any O2 and
subjected to constant stirring before the reaction. The reactor was
then exposed to UV light (100 W ultraviolet lamp H-144GC-100 Sylvania
par 38 with a flux of around 5 mW/cm2 at a distance of
5 cm). Similarly, to evaluate the UV + visible light activity, a xenon
lamp (Asahi spectra MAX-303) with a total flux of 42.5 mW/cm2 (UV ∼ 3.0 mW/cm2 and visible (up to 650 nm)) at
a distance of 2 cm was used. Product analyses were performed by a
gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector connected
to a Porapak Q packed column (2 m) at 45 °C, and N2 was used as a carrier gas. The BzCHO content was monitored by GC-MS
from Thermo Scientific (Waltham, MA USA) equipped with trance 1300
(GC) and ISQ single quadrupole (MS). Apparent quantum yields (AQYs)
at various wavelengths defined by eq 1(27) were calculated by data
obtained using monochromatic light-emitting diode (365–750
nm) at a distance of 2 cm. The corresponding light intensities were
measured with a GL Spectis 5.0 Touch spectrometer. 2  

4.4 Femtosecond Transient Absorption (TA) Measurements
Time-resolved absorption decays of the catalyst suspension in water
were measured with a pump–probe setup, in which a white light
continuum probe pulse was generated in a 2 mm thick sapphire plate
contained in an Ultrafast System LLC spectrometer using few microjoules
energy of an 800 nm pulse. The fundamental output delivered by a Ti/sapphire
femtosecond regenerative amplifier
operating at 800 nm with 35 fs pulses and a repetition rate of 1 kHz.
Spectrally tunable (240–2600 nm) femtosecond pulses generated
by an optical parametric amplifier (Light Conversion Ltd) and a white
light continuum were used, respectively, as the pump (excitation)
and probe beams in a pump–probe experimental setup (Helios).
The details of the experimental setup can be found elsewhere.28
