Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was synthesized from a simple,
cost-effective,
and eco-friendly method by using Capsicum annuum (CA) as reducing agent. The rGO was mixed with SnO2 to
synthesize a nanocomposite. The synthesized materials were characterized
by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning
electron microscopy, and UV–visible spectroscopy techniques.
The SnO2-C. annuum reduced
graphene oxide (CRGO) nanocomposite exhibited a photodegradation efficiency
of 97.4% when employed to remove methylene green (MG) dye. The synthesized
nanocomposite showed improved photodegradation ability due to its
high charge transfer and separation and owing to the presence of the
large surface area of the CRGO network system. Degraded water was
used in the plant and animal survival study, in which the dye solution
treated with CRGO nanocomposite exhibited better growth compared to
that of untreated MG solution. Likewise, in the ecotoxicity study, Artemia salina and zebra fish (Danio
rerio) survival was found to be enhanced with CRGO
nanocomposite-treated dye solution. This finding supports the effectiveness
of CRGO/SnO2 nanocomposite for the treatment of MG dye-contaminated
effluent samples.

==== Body
Introduction
The most important problem threatening
the present world is pollution
in different ecosystems. Due to the growth of textile industries and
dye houses, huge quantities of effluents are mixed with water bodies.
Textile effluents containing a large amount of organic synthetic dyes
contaminate water bodies leading to severe health problems for human
beings. The dye effluents are very toxic and lead to hereditary incurable
diseases like breast and colon cancer, heart diseases, hemophilia,
etc.1−3 Many methods have been employed to tackle the problems of water
pollution.4 Photocatalytic treatment is
a well-established method for dye degradation.

Graphene-based
semiconductor photocatalysts are well established
for dye degradation in polluted water.5 Tin dioxide (SnO2) is a good semiconductor that has a
large number of potential applications.6,7 Many research
works have used TiO2 as a photocatayst. Although SnO2 has a similar band gap to TiO2, it has a few special
features like nontoxic nature, low production cost, and good chemical
stability.8,9 Very few works have been carried out with
SnO2 for organic dye removal. Due to these reasons, SnO2 is employed as a photocatalyst.10,11 Graphene is a good conductive material with one-atom thickness and
has sp2-bonded arrangement with hexagonal lattices. It
has a zero band gap, high electronic conductivity for storing and
transporting electrons, and also has excellent mechanical, thermal,
optical, and electrical properties.12 Therefore,
graphene-based materials exhibit excellent diverse field applications.13−18 Graphene-based semiconductor photocatalysts facilitate effective
photodegradation of pollutants because the composite has excellent
adsorptive, transparency, conductivity, and controllability properties.19

In photocatalysis, the light passing into
the semiconductor oxide/sulfide
layer results in electron movements from the valence band (VB) to
the conduction band (CB). Then, excited electron and electron–hole
pairs are formed. The main problem in semiconductor metal oxide materials
is the quick recombination of the excited electrons with the electron
hole. In the case of metal oxide composites with graphene, the fast
electron recombination process is retarded by the trap of electrons
by the graphene sheet. The excited electrons react with oxygen and
water molecules to form oxygen radicals20 and also the electron–hole pairs form free oxygen radicals
with water molecules. During the degradation, huge numbers of intermediate
molecules are formed; some of the intermediate molecules are more
poisonous than the parent dye molecules. Due to the generation of
toxic intermediates, it is desirable to investigate the degraded dye
water employed in the animal and plant survival study. Mung bean (Vigna radiata) is one of the major food plants found
in Asian countries.20 The plant survival
study is carried out using the V. radiata plant. Likewise, Artemia salina (AS)
and zebra fish (Danio rerio) are fish
species tha can survive even in water having very low amounts of oxygen.21−25 Therefore, both the A. salina (AS)
and zebra fish (D. rerio) are taken
for the survival study in the dye-degraded water.

Chemical and
thermal methods are the two methods employed for graphene
(or) reduced graphene oxide (rGO).26,27 In the chemical
method, strong chemical reducing agents are used and these chemicals
are toxic to the environment and human beings. Some of the chemical
reducing agents are carcinogenic. In the thermal method, the graphene
sheets are damaged during strong heating and cause surface modification
of the graphene sheets.28 To overcome these
disadvantages, nontoxic eco-friendly reducing agents are used to reduce
the graphene oxide (GO). Some natural products have very good reducing
ability, but only few of them are used to reduce the GO to prepare
rGO. In the eco-friendly method, plant extracts, fruit extracts, and
some microorganisms are used to reduce the GO. Capsicum
annuum (CA) is one of the vegetables containing more
polyphenol in their extract.29,30 Due to their rich polyphenolic
content, CA can act as an excellent antioxidant, and so far it has
been used to reduce the GO. In this work, rGO is synthesized using
a natural reducing agent, namely, CA. A composite is prepared by combining
this rGO with SnO2 nanoparticles.31,32 The developed composite is then used for the photocatalytic degradation
of the methylene green (MG) dye. The methylene green (MG) dye is one
of the organic dye (Figure 1); it used for coloring fabrics. MG dye has a similar structure
to methylene blue (MB); the MG dye has one more NO2 group;
therefore, it has higher adverse effects than the MB dye. Most of
the researchers already reported the MB dye using photocatalytic degradation
studies, whereas this is the first research work on the MG dye degradation
by using green rGO–SnO2 [C. annuum reduced graphene oxide (CRGO)/SnO2] nanocomposite as
a photocatalyst.

Figure 1 Structure of methylene green (MG).

The ecotoxicology assessment of the dye-degraded
water is attempted
using the plant and animal survival studies. A. salina (AS) and zebra fish (D. rerio) are
the chosen aquatic species for animal survival study. V. radiata plant is employed for the plant survival
study in the degraded dye water. Figure 2 illustrates the synthesis of CGRO and CRGO/SnO2 nanocomposite for photocatalytic degradation of methylene
green (MG) dye.

nanocomposite and degradation process of methylene green (MG) dye.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Graphite powder, ethanol, hydrazine monohydrate,
potassium permanganate, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, methylene
green (MG), and hydrogen peroxide were purchased from Merck Pvt, Ltd.,
India. C. annuum (CA) was purchased
from the local market in Karunyanagar, Coimbatore, South India.

Synthesis of Graphene Oxide
Modified Hummers’
method was used to prepare graphene oxide synthesis.33 Graphite powder (0.167 mol) was taken in a 250 mL round-bottom
(RB) flask and 100 mL of conc. H2SO4 was added
to it. This mixture was sonicated for 30 min. Following this, 0.167
mol sodium nitrate (NaNO3) was added and the mixture was
continuously stirred under ice bath condition. While stirring, potassium
permanganate (0.5 mol) was slowly added at regular intervals of time.
After 2 h stirring, the temperature was increased to 35 °C and
maintained for 2 days. A pasty brownish product was formed, which
was transferred into a beaker. To this product, 90 mL of water was
added to dilute the solution. Then, 10 mL of H2O2 solution was slowly added to the contents of the beaker. Finally,
the formed product was washed with 10% dil. HCl solution and a large
amount of deionized water. Finally, the solution was filtered and
dried to get a dark brown GO powder.

Preparation of Capsicum Annum Extract
The purchased
CA was washed with deionized water, and its head portion was cut off.
The cut pieces were washed and the seeds were removed. The cleaned
sliced pieces were dried at 40 °C in N2 atm for 2
days. After drying, the sliced pieces were taken in a Soxhlet apparatus,
and using ethanol as the solvent, it was subjected to extraction.
The pure extraction product was collected, and the solvent was removed
using a rotary evaporator (Equitron). After drying and filtering using
a Whatman filter paper, an aqueous extract of CA was obtained.32

Synthesis of CRGO by C. annuum
About 6 mmol GO powder was taken in a 200 mL RB flask,
to which 40 mL of ethanol was added and sonicated for 20 min. To the
dispersed graphene oxide solution, 30 mL of pure CA extract (0.5:30)
was added, and the mixture was refluxed at 80 °C for 5 h. The
color of the solution changed from brown to black along with precipitation,
indicating the reduction of GO to rGO. This experiment was carried
out with various concentrations of CA extract to confirm and also
to optimize the reducing ability of CA extract.32

Preparation of CRGO/SnO2 Nanocomposites
The chemical method was used to prepare the CRGO/SnO2 nanocomposite.
Stannous chloride (SnCl2, 0.1 M) was mixed with a calculated
amount of CRGO; the mixture was subjected to magnetic stirring for
30 min at 80 °C. While stirring, 0.2 M KOH solution was added
to the mixture slowly. After 3 h stirring, the solution was washed
with ethanol and water several times. The obtained product was filtered
and dried (at 80 °C for 4 h) to get the powder form of CRGO/SnO2 nanocomposite.34 The same procedure
was adopted to prepare the SnO2 nanoparticles without the
addition of CRGO.

Characterizations
The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR)
spectra of the formed product was recorded using a Shimadzu FT-IR
(Japan) spectrophotometer. The surface morphology was studied using
a scanning electron microscope (JEOL-ASM 6390, Japan). The X-ray diffraction
(XRD) pattern was also studied using an X-ray diffractometer (Shimadzu
XRD 6000, Japan). The absorption spectra were obtained using a UV–visible
spectrometer (Jasco V-630, Japan).

Photocatalytic Studies
Photocatalytic degradation of
the methylene green (MG) dye was studied using the CRGO/SnO2 nanocomposite under visible light (VL) irradiation. The photocatalytic
reactor setup employed had a flat-bottom borosilicate glass tube of
4 cm length and 12 cm height. The suspension was stirred constantly
using a magnetic stirrer during the course of the experiment so as
to maintain the homogeneity of the solution. A 150 W tungsten lamp
was positioned in the middle of the reaction vessel as the visible
light source. In the degradation studies, 20 mg of CRGO/SnO2 nanocomposite was suspended in 50 mL of aqueous solution containing
MG dye at a concentration of 4 × 10–5 M. At
the start of the experiment, the suspension was continuously stirred
in the dark for about 15–20 min prior to visible light irradiation.
At given time intervals, 3 mL of the suspension was sampled and centrifuged
at a speed of 3000 rpm for 10 min to separate the photocatalyst particles
from the solution. The supernatant liquid was analyzed for the residual
concentration of the MG dye under study. The MG dye was analyzed by
recording the variations in absorbance at the characteristic absorption
band of λmax = 625 nm in addition to scanning over
the wavelength from 300 to 800 nm using a PerkinElmer UV–vis
spectrophotometer. The photocatalytic efficiency was calculated using
the relation given below 1  where Ct and C0 are the concentrations of MG dye after time
“t” and at the start, respectively.

The photocatalytic activities of the bare GO, reduced GO, and graphite
were also carried out for the same MG dye aqueous solution and compared
to the photocatalytic activity of the solution added with the CRGO/SnO2 nanocomposite.

Ecotoxicology Study
Hatchable cysts of A. salina (AS) brine shrimps salt lake were purchased
from a nearby aquarium, and hatching of the cysts was carried out
in the brine solution containing 3.5% NaCl at ambient temperature,
under continuous aeration for 24 h. Hatched nauplii were separated
from unhatched cysts after 48 h. Active nauplii were selected under
light and further divided into three groups each containing 10 animals.
Active nauplii were used for studying the toxicity assessment of MG
water and CRGO-treated water. Similarly, MG-induced alteration in
erythrocyctes of zebra fish (D. rerio) was studied in parallel as a marker for assessing the toxic ability
of CRGO-treated and control samples. Healthy zebra fish procured from
nearby aquarium were in-housed in laboratory conditions for acclimatization
for 60 days before the experiment. Fish of the same size and body
weight were sorted into three groups each containing n = 5 fish, and 12 dark/light cycles were maintained throughout the
experiment. Pellet feeds were used thrice a day for all of the three
groups. The spiked concentration of MG (4 × 10–5 M) positive control and distilled water without MG was used as experimental
control for 7 days and heparinized blood were drawn from the tail
cut after euthanasia by an ice-cold bath on the 8th day. Morphological
alteration by visual examination and alteration in the RBC’s
morphology were studied.

Results and Discussion
Characterization of Synthesized Materials
XRD Analysis
The interlayer changes and crystalline
properties of graphite and synthesized materials like graphene oxide,
CRGO, SnO2 nanoparticles, and CRGO/SnO2 nanocomposite
were studied by XRD analysis. From the analysis of Figure 3, it is observed that graphite
exhibits diffraction peaks at a 2θ value of 26° with 0.34
nm of interlayer spacing. The GO and the CRGO displayed diffraction
peaks (2θ) at 10.5 and 24.5°, respectively. The interlayer
spacing value of GO was 0.9 nm, and it was higher than that of the
graphite interlayer spacing value because of the addition of functional
groups, which contain oxygen functionalities (hydroxyl, carboxyl,
and epoxy groups) in the interposition of the graphite sheets when
oxidized with oxidizing agents like H2SO4, KMnO4, and H2O2. After the reduction of GO
using the CA extract, the diffraction peaks (2θ) value moved
to 24.5°, indicating the reduction of GO into CRGO, thus confirming
the reducing ability of the CA extract. The XRD patterns of pure SnO2 nanoparticles were studied, and all of the diffraction peak
values of SnO2 nanoparticles corresponded to the tetragonal
SnO2 phase (JCPDS: 41-1445).27 The SnO2/CRGO nanocomposite also had a similar XRD pattern
of formation of SnO2 in the tetragonal phase, which also
indicates the CRGO/SnO2 nanocomposite.

of graphite, graphene oxide (GO), reduced
graphene oxide (CRGO), SnO2 nanoparticles, and SnO2/CRGO nanocomposite.

FT-IR Spectra
The FT-IR spectra of synthesized graphene
oxide, CRGO, and CRGO/SnO2 nanocomposite are shown in Figure 4. The absorption
peaks of GO show bands at 1600 and 1500 cm–1, which
correspond to the C=O and C=C stretching vibration,
indicating the presence of carboxylic acid and carbonyl functional
groups on the GO. The absorption peaks at 1000 and 900 cm–1 corresponding to C–OH and C–O stretching vibrations
indicate the presence of alcoholic groups on the GO, and the absorption
peaks at 2900 and 2800 cm–1 correspond to the asymmetric
and symmetric vibrations of C–H band, respectively. After the
reduction of GO by the CA extract, the peak intensity was decreased,
indicating the removal of oxygen functional groups from the GO structure,
which also goes to confirm the formation of rGO.35 The absorption band which appears above 500 cm–1 indicates the presence of metal particles of SnO2. In
the CRGO/SnO2 nanocomposite, the absorption peaks appear
above 500 and 3400 cm–1, indicating the presence
of metal particles like SnO2 nanoparticles and the O–H
stretching vibration for C–OH groups, respectively.36 All of these observations help us to understand
that the CRGO/SnO2 nanocomposite contains SnO2 nanoparticles and CRGO in its structural matrix.

oxide (GO), reduced graphene oxide (CRGO),
SnO2 nanoparticles, and CRGO/SnO2 nanocomposite.

Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)
SEM was used to
analyze the surface morphology of prepared CRGO and CRGO/SnO2 nanocomposite. From Figure 5, the SEM image of CRGO shows a layer structure, which is
due to the reduction of GO by the natural reducing agent, namely,
CA extract. The CRGO/SnO2 nanocomposite image shows triangle-shaped
particles which are spread all over the nanocomposite, indicating
the equal distribution of SnO2 nanoparticles on the CRGO
surface.

Figure 5 SEM images of GO, CRGO, SnO2, and SnO2/CRGO
nanocomposite.

TEM analysis was also used to investigate the surface
morphology
of the synthesized GO, CRGO, and SnO2/CRGO. From Figure 6, it is clear that
GO has a wrinkle and folded-like form on their structure, and selected
area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns show sharp rings, indicating
that the GO has a multiple sheeted structure. The GO undergoes the
reduction process by using natural reducing agent C.
annuum. After reduction, GO exhibited the absence
of wrinkle and folding in their structure because of the removal of
oxygen functionalities, and the SAED pattern exhibited a short-range
ordering, which is a clear evidence for the formation of single-sheeted
CRGO. In the CRGO/SnO2 image, the SnO2 nanoparticles
are seen to be speared over the CRGO sheet. The average size of the
SnO2 nanoparticles is 48 nm (S1). Both the XRD and SAED patterns from TEM images are matched with
their respective plane for their structural confirmations (S2).

CRGO, SnO2, and SnO2/CRGO nanocomposite.

Energy-Dispersive Spectrometry (EDS)
The elemental
distribution was studied using the EDS analysis. Table 1 gives the elemental atom %
of CRGO, SnO2, and CRGO/SnO2 nanocomposite.
The CRGO has carbon and oxygen atoms to the extents of 75.65 and 24.35
atom %, respectively. The SnO2 nanoparticles contain tin
and oxygen atoms to the extent of 80.47 and 19.53 atom %, respectively.
The CRGO/SnO2 nanocomposite shows carbon, oxygen, and stannous
atoms with 30.49, 57.60, and 11.91 atom %, respectively. This can
be taken as an additional confirmation for the CRGO/SnO2 nanocomposite formation.

Table 1 EDS Values for CRGO, SnO2, and CRGO/SnO2 Nanocomposite
elements	CRGO	SnO2	CRGO/SnO2 nanocomposite	
carbon (atom %)	75.65	 	30.49	
oxygen (atom %)	24.35	80.47	57.60	
tin (atom %)	 	19.53	11.91	
The EDS elemental color mapping was carried out for
the synthesized
CRGO/SnO2 nanocomposite, and it is shown in Figure 7. Figure 7a–c shows the individual color mapping
of O, C, and Sn, and Figure 7d exhibits a uniform distribution of all of the individual
elements all over the nanocomposite. This clearly confirms the complete
formation of the CRGO/SnO2 nanocomposite.

CRGO/SnO2 nanocomposite.

UV–Vis Spectra
The study of absorption behavior
of the as-synthesized nanomaterial is one of the most important parameters,
and the optical absorbance spectra of CRGO, SnO2, and CRGO/SnO2 nanocomposite are shown in Figure 8. These samples show absorption bands in
the UV region of the spectra. This was attributed to the intrinsic
band gap absorption of SnO2 due to the electron excitation
from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB). However, there
are notable changes in the absorbance of the CRGO/SnO2 composite
compared to that of CRGO. The detected changes reflected in the absorbance
edge are related to the narrowing of the band gap energy. From this
figure, the band gap values are 3.29 (377 nm), 3.95 (314 nm), and
3.5 eV (352 nm) for CRGO, SnO2, and CRGO/SnO2 nanocomposite, respectively. If there is reduction in the band gap
energy, excitation of electrons from the valance band to the conduction
band utilizes very low energy, which will provide more electron/positive–hole
pairs and enhance the photocatalytic removal of the dyes.

for reduced graphene oxide (CRGO), SnO2 nanoparticles,
and CRGO/SnO2 nanocomposite.

Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS)
Electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to analyze the transfer performance
and photogenerated charge separation on the CRGO/SnO2 naocomposite. Figure 9 shows the Nyquist
impedance plots of the CRGO, SnO2, and CRGO/SnO2 naocomposite. These plots clearly show that the CRGO/SnO2 nanocomposite exhibits lower charge resistance compared to CRGO
and SnO2; therefore, the CRGO/SnO2 naocomposite
has higher photodegradation efficiency on MG dye.

of CRGO, SnO2, and CRGO/SnO2 nanocomposite.

Proposed Reaction Mechanism for CRGO Synthesis
Graphite
powder was oxidized with oxidizing agents like conc. H2SO4, KMnO4, NaNO3, and H2O2. The oxidation converts the graphite powder into GO.
The GO was reacted with the CA extract (rich in phenolic compounds).
As shown in Figure 10, the alcoholic group of the phenolic compounds interacts with the
epoxide group of GO to form intermediate I and intermediate II. At
the end of the reduction process, the reduced form of GO was formed
along with the oxidized form of the phenolic compounds. XPS exhibits
the additional confirmation for the formation of CRGO from GO (S3).

Figure 10 Proposed plausible mechanism for the synthesis
of rGO.

Photocatalytic Activity
Decolorization of Methylene Green Dye in Different Catalytic
Systems
The photocatalytic effect of CRGO/SnO2 nanocomposites was studied under visible light irradiation. Under
the dark conditions, no degradation was observed. To evaluate the
efficiency and the benefit of each condition on the MG dye degradation,
experiments were carried out under the following conditions: (a) dye
+ visible light (VL), (b) dye + GO + VL, (c) dye + GR + VL, (d) dye
+ rGO + VL, (e) dye + CRGO/SnO2 + VL, and (f) dye + rGO
+ no light. The results of the MG dye degradation under various conditions
are shown in Figure 11. The error bias for the photocatalytic activity of the CRGO/SnO2 nanocomposite was confirmed by mean and standard deviation,
which are also included in S4. From this,
it confirms the precise value for the degradation study.

Figure 11 Photocatalytic
degradation of methylene green using different catalysts
under visible light irradiations. Catalyst = 20 mg/50 mL; [dye] =
4 × 10–5 M.

The figure shows the relationships between irradiation
time and
decolorization rate of MG dye solution treated by the CRGO/SnO2 nanocomposite, bare rGO, and without photocatalyst under
visible light irradiation. The decolorization rates of the MG dye
solution are 97.4 and 80.8% for the CRGO/SnO2 nanocomposite
and SnO2, respectively, after 60 min of visible light irradiation,
while the efficiency of decolorization of MG solution without any
photocatalyst is negligible. The photocatalytic activity of the CRGO/SnO2 nanocomposite is greater than that of SnO2 under
visible light irradiation, which is illustrated in Figure 12.

Figure 12 Decolorization rates
of MG dye solution by using different catalysts
under visible light irradiation for 60 min.

From the results, it is observed that the MG dye
is resistant to
oxidation without the use of photocatalyst. As expected, the direct
photolysis (VL alone) is not an efficient process and can be neglected
since less than 25% degradation within 60 min of visible light illumination
occurred. When CRGO/SnO2 nanocomposite was used as the
photocatalyst, the MG dye removal was 97.4% during 60 min visible
light irradiation. Therefore, the as-synthesized CRGO/SnO2 nanocomposite is more efficient than the other catalyst combination,
and it exhibits better degradation ability compared to the reported
RGO and SnO2-based photocatalyst (Table 2).

The relative degradation efficiencies of the studied
conditions
are in the following order  

Scavenging Effects
The photocatalytic degradation studies
of the methylene green dye by the CRGO/SnO2 nanocomposite
were also confirmed by scavenging studies (Figure 13). The scavengers or quenching studies are
used to examine the role of the reactive species in the photocatalytic
mechanism. Ammonium oxalate (AO), benzoquinone (BQ), and isopropanol
(IP) act as scavengers with active radicals h+, O2•–, and •OH, respectively.
The experiment was carried out in similar conditions without scavengers
and with these three active radicals on methylene green dye in the
presence of photocatalyst. After the degradation, it exhibits 97,
36, 55, and 48% of MG degradation for catalyst, AO, BQ, and IP, respectively.
Therefore, from this experiment, it is clearly shown that these three
active radicals involve in the photocatalytic mechanism and also for
the production of hydroxyl radicals.

Figure 13 Quenching studies of reactive species
during the photocatalytic
degradation of MG dye over CRGO/SnO2 nanocomposite.

UV–Vis Absorption Spectroscopy
The absorption
spectra of the MG dye solution acquired at different reaction times
are shown in Figure 14. The spectra show four peaks which are normally observed for the
MG dye solution. The peak at 630 nm corresponds to the green chromophore
of MG, and the other three peaks at 315, 380, and 420 nm correspond
to the benzoic rings in the dye structure. The peak intensity decreases
gradually and finally disappears after 60 min of irradiation in the
presence of the CRGO/SnO2 nanocomposite. After the degradation
of the MG dye by the nanocomposite catalyst, there is no absorption
band seen in the visible region, which indicates the complete degradation
of MG dye and also confirms the degradation ability of the CRGO/SnO2 nanocomposite in the process.

changes for the degradation of MG dye under
visible light irradiation using the CRGO/SnO2 nanocomposite
catalyst.

Effect of Catalyst Dosages
The optimization of the
amount of the catalyst required for the complete degradation of MG
dye is essential. Figure 15 shows that the CRGO/SnO2 nanocomposite has excellent
photocatalytic activity in degrading the MG dye, and therefore, the
effect of catalyst dosage on the MG dye degradation was investigated.
The catalyst dosage was increased from 10 to 50 mg, and the degradation
percentage was also found to increase from 25 to 99% due to the increase
in the number of photogenerated e•h+ pairs.
When the amount of catalyst increases, the amount of •OH and •O2 radicals also increases,
which would degrade efficiently on the MG dye solution.

Figure 15 Effect of
catalyst dosages on the MG dye degradation under visible
light irradiation.

Figure 15 shows
that the percentage degradation of the MG dye enhances from 25.68
to 99.4% with increasing dosages of CRGO/SnO2 nanocomposite,
respectively, from 10 to 20 mg. However, further increase in the catalyst
dosages from 20 to 50 mg led to a decline in the degradation percentage
down to 60.55%. Normally, the increase in the amount of catalyst increases
the number of active sites, which in turn increases the amount of
OH• and O2•– radicals, which would degrade MG. But when the concentration of
the catalyst increases above the optimum value, the percentage degradation
decreases, due to the scattering effect of light by the catalyst particles.
Sun et al. reported41 that the excess catalyst
prevented the penetration of the light, thus decreasing the primary
oxidants in the photocatalytic system, i.e., hydroxy radicals, which
in turn decreases the percentage of degradation. Also the excess amount
of catalyst beyond the optimum concentration would agglomerate and
render the catalyst surface unavailable for photon absorption, resulting
in a decrease of the photodegradation efficiency. Therefore, the optimal
dosage of the catalyst nanocomposite for the MG degradation was found
to be 20 mg.

Stability and Reusability of Photocatalyst
The stability
and reusability of the photocatalyst was investigated by CRGO/SnO2 for the degradation of MG dye (Figure 16). All of the five repeated experiments
were carried out under similar reaction conditions. After completing
each and every cycle, the degraded solution was filtrated and the
remaining catalyst was also collected, and it was dried under high
vacuum. Then, this collected catalyst was used again for the degradation
of the MG dye; this experiment was repeated nearly five times with
the same catalyst. The catalytic efficiencies of the used catalyst
were 97.01, 95.32, 93.7, 80.74, and 69.86% for the first, second,
third, fourth, and fifth cycles, respectively. Therefore, the catalytic
efficiency of the used catalyst was retained for up to five cycles;
from this result, it is clearly revealed that the CRGO/SnO2 photocatalyst has good stability and reusability.

of MG dye under the visible light irradiation.

out to find the mineralization of MG dye under visible light irradiation.
During photodegradation, the organic dye decomposed into small toxic
intermediates. The initial TOC values before and after degradation
by different catalytic materials are shown in Figure 17. From these data, it is clearly understandable
that the high degradation efficiency of the SnO2/CRGO nanocomposite
leads to the complete mineralization of the MG organic dye.

Figure 17 TOC analysis
of the degradation of the methylene green dye in the
presence of different catalysts under visible light irradiation.

Mass Spectra
Mass spectrophotometry was used to analyze
the dye degradation products of the photocatalytic degradation process.
During degradation, some intermediates were formed, such as N-(7-(dimethylamino)-4-nitro-3H-phenothiazin-3-ylidene)-N-methylmethanaminium (m/z = 329), 3-(3-(dimethylamino)cyclohexa-1,4-dienylsulfinyl)-N1,N1-dimethylbenzene-1,4-diamine (m/z = 305), (Z)-N,N-dimethyl-7-(methylimino)-7H-phenothiazin-3-amine (m/z = 269),
3-(3-aminocyclohexa-1,4-dienylsulfinyl)-N1-methylbenzene-1,4-diamine
(m/z = 264), 2-(3-aminocyclohexa-1,4-dienylthio)benzene-1,4-diamine
(m/z = 235), 3,7-dimethyl-3H-phenothiazine (m/z =
227), 2-amino-5-(methylamino)benzenesulfinic acid (m/z = 186), 2-methylbenzene-1,4-diamine (m/z = 122), and p-toluidine
(m/z = 107), as shown in Figure 18. Figure 19 shows the plausible mechanism
for the degradation based on the intermediates formed.

dye in the
presence of the CRGO/SnO2 nanocomposite under visible light
irradiation.

Plausible Photodegradation Mechanism
The photocatalytic
activity of the CRGO/SnO2 nanocomposite under visible light
can be attributed to its adsorption capacity, absorption of visible
light capability, and the suppression of recombination of electron–hole
pair. After visible light irradiation, the electrons from the valance
band of SnO2 excite into the conduction band, and then
photogenerated electrons and electron–hole pairs are formed.
The photogenerated electrons are transferred to the CRGO sheets, and
the CRGO sheets act as a trap to inhibit the sudden recombination
of the photogenerated electrons into the electron–hole pairs.
The trapped electrons in the from CRGO react with the oxygen dissolved
in water forming oxygen radicals, and also the excited electrons SnO2 react with the dissolved oxygen directly and form more oxygen
radicals. The oxygen radicals react with water to form reactive hydroxyl
radicals, and this hydroxyl radical is the major radical involved
in the degradation of the MG dye molecules. At the same time, the
photogenerated electron–hole pairs also react with water directly
and form hydroxyl radicals, which again involve in the dye molecules
degradation. Excess of dye molecules are adsorbed by the CRGO/SnO2 nanocomposite due to its large surface area. The plausible
mechanism for the photodegradation reaction is given in Figure 20 2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9

(MG) dye degradation
under visible light irradiation.

Phytotoxicity
During the photocatalytic dye degradation,
some of the intermediates (or) degraded byproducts formed may be more
toxic than the initial dye solution. Therefore, the toxicity of the
degraded solution is investigated. Some analytical methods are available
to investigate such toxicity, but bioassay is one of the most efficient
and reliable methods for the toxicity analysis. Zee may assay was
used to perform the phytotoxicity studies. The mung bean (V. radiata) seeds were exposed to treated dye solution,
untreated dye solution, and control water solution. After 15 days,
the germination percentage and root and shoot lengths of the plant
were analyzed and tabulated in Table 3. From the table, the control solution showed 100%
germination and also higher root and shoot lengths as shown in Figure 21. The treated dye
solution showed 85% germination and root and shoot lengths of the
plant almost similar to the control solution. But the untreated dye
solution showed only 35% of germination and the root and shoot lengths
were very low compared to the other conditions. This goes to show
that the untreated dye solution exhibits toxicity on the seed growth.
The CRGO/SnO2 nanocomposite-treated dye solution exhibited
very low toxicity on the seeds similar to the control solution. Therefore,
one can understand the efficiency of the CRGO/SnO2 nanocomposite
in the dye degradation process.

MG dye solutions after different times of exposure on mung bean (V. radiata) plant model.

AS Mortality Assay
Survival experiment was conducted
on AS to assess the lethality percentage of CRGO/SnO2 nanocomposite-treated
MG dye solution and the untreated MG dye solution. Grouped nauplii
were allowed to interact with the solution spiked with MG solution
and CRGO/SnO2 nanocomposite-treated water in the 96-well
assay plates. The morbidity and mortality were calculated for 12,
24, and 48 h under an inverted phase contrast microscope. The survival
(%) of AS = final number of nauplii at each time/initial number of
nauplii × 100. CRGO/SnO2 nanocomposite-treated water
showed 95, 85, and 85% survival during 12, 24, and 48 h of incubation,
respectively. Only 10, 5, and >1% survival was observed in the
MG
spiked wells. The control wells showed 95, 90, and 85% survival at
the end of 48 h (Figure 22). Complete uptake of MG dye on the AS was observed after
12 and 24 h of incubation in the untreated dye solution. No chromogenic
alteration was observed in the CRGO/SnO2 nanocomposite-treated
sample, which indicates the degradation of the dye; however, physiological
alteration by shrinkage of internal organs and asymmetry of appendage
size were observed without mortality. Alteration in appendage size
and growth was reported earlier in arsenic-induced toxicity.

untreated (MG), treated (rGO-treated MG sample), and control (distilled
water).

MG-Induced Alteration in D. rerio
Morphological alteration including epidermal changes was
reported earlier along with mortality in the aquatic model for studying
ecotoxicology studies in zebra fish (Figure 23). During the experimental period, no lethality
was observed in all of the three groups. Alteration in the color scales
was observed in the MG-containing (untreated) fish, indicative of
the effect of toxicity. No modification was observed in the control
(freshwater) and CRGO/SnO2 nanocomposite (treated) fish.

Figure 23 Survival
assessment of (a) control, (b) treated, and (c) untreated
MG dye solution after different times of exposure on zebra fish (D. rerio) animal model.

The effect of alteration in the RBC on the morphology
of RBCs is
considered as marker for assessment of any anemic-inducing toxic compounds
in the in vivo assessment. RBCs from the MG-treated, untreated, and
control fish were examined by collecting heparinized tail cut blood
after a brief centrifugation. A thin smear was fixed on the degreased
glass side, stained, and visualized under oil immersion for alteration
in RBCs. Untreated (MG) fish showed completed lysis of nuclear membrane.
The CRGO/SnO2 nanocomposite-treated sample does not induce
complete morphological alteration; however, condensation on the membrane
was observed. The control sample has no alteration in RBCs where distinct
nucleus and membrane were observed.

Conclusions
In this study, a low-cost, eco-friendly
CRGO and CRGO/SnO2 nanocomposite was synthesized and characterized.
The green CRGO
is successfully incorporate with SnO2 nanoparticles to
synthesize CRGO/SnO2 nanocomposite. The photodegradation
efficiency was investigated using MG as model dye. The CRGO/SnO2 nanocomposite has higher photodegradation efficiency compared
to other materials because of the incorporation of CRGO with SnO2 nanoparticles. The lowest surface area of nanocomposite has
enhanced the higher dye adsorption, at the same time, CRGO will trap
the excited electrons (e–), which leads to decrease
in the recombination process and increase in the photodegradation
activity (97.4%/60 min). The toxicity nature of the treated dye solution
was evaluated by survival studies using mung bean, and living species
AS and zebra fish (D. rerio) showed
excellent survival activity in the treated MG dye solution compared
to the untreated MG dye solution. The enhanced photocatalytic activity
of the CRGO/SnO2 nanocomposite will be helpful to degrade
the untreated water for marine applications, and also plant life has
been clearly brought out in this present work.
