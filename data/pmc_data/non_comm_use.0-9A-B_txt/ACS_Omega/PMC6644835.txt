The physical and
gas-transport properties of Fe3+ cross-linked
Nafion membranes were examined. Wide-angle X-ray diffraction results
revealed a lower crystallinity for Nafion Fe3+ but showed
essentially no changes in the average chain spacing upon cation exchange
of Nafion H+. Raman and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
techniques qualitatively measured the strength of the ionic bond between
the Fe3+ cations and sulfonate anions. Thermal gravimetric
analysis indicated that the incorporation of Fe3+ adversely
affected the thermal stability of Nafion due to the catalytic decomposition
of perfluoroalkylether side chains. Gas sorption isotherms of Nafion
Fe3+ measured at 35 °C up to 20 atm exhibited a linear
sorption uptake for O2, N2, and CH4 following Henry’s law and slight concave behavior for CO2. Pure-gas permeation results showed reduced gas permeability
but higher permselectivities compared to Nafion H+ with
αN2/CH4 = 4.0, αCO2/CH4 = 35, and αHe/CH4 = 733 attributable to
the strong physical cross-linking effect of Fe3+ that caused
chain stiffening with enhanced size-sieving behavior. Gas mixture
permeation experiments using 1:1 molar CO2/CH4 feed demonstrated reduced CO2 plasticization for Nafion
Fe3+. At 10 atm CO2 partial pressure, CO2/CH4 selectivity decreased to 28 from the pure-gas
value of 35, which was a significant improvement compared to the performance
of a Nafion H+ membrane.

Introduction
Polymeric membranes are of increasing
interest and importance for
industrial gas separation applications such as nitrogen production
from air, olefin/paraffin separation, hydrogen recovery in petrochemical
plants, and carbon dioxide removal from natural gas.1−6 The requirements for a preferred membrane material include high
permeability, high selectivity, and good thermal and mechanical integrity
at the operating conditions.7,8 Robeson’s pure-gas
permeability/selectivity “upper-bound” curves identified
an undesirable tradeoff: polymer membrane materials with high selectivity
typically show low permeability and vice versa.9,10 In
the area of CO2/CH4 separation, removal of CO2 from natural gas or biogas is of particular commercial interest.1,4,11−13 The strong
interaction and resulting high sorption uptake of CO2 in
polymer membranes can result in swelling-induced plasticization. Therefore,
mixed-gas CO2/CH4 selectivity is often significantly
reduced compared to pure-gas values due to the dilation of the polymer
matrix, which leads to high CH4 process losses, thus making
membrane-based separation less attractive.14−19 Therefore, considerable research has been devoted to tailoring the
structure/composition of the polymer to achieve improved performance.
Ionomers, such as sulfonated polymers comprising strong acidic sulfonate
groups, potentially provide a convenient and advantageous approach
for tailoring material properties via metal complexations that can
cause substantial improvements in gas separation properties.20−26

Ionomers are known for their complex morphology, in which
sulfonic
groups together with counterions form aggregates that enable physical
cross-linking.27,28 Consequently, cation exchange
in ionomers can induce significant changes in their physical properties
including enhancement in glass transition temperature,28−35 increase in Young’s modulus,32,34,35 and reduction in chain mobility27,28,32,33,36 that play a crucial role in the intrinsic gas separation
performance of the material. For example, Park et al. reported pure-gas
transport properties of sulfonated polysulfone membranes neutralized
with several metal cations and showed that the cation-exchanged membranes
improved the CO2/N2 selectivity moderately due
to ionic cross-linking.20 However, the
CO2 permeability was reduced by 63% from 5.4 to 2.0 Barrers
due to reduction in the CO2 diffusion coefficient. Chen
et al. reported the permeabilities for a series of gases including
CO2 and CH4 in sulfonated polystyrene (PSS)
membranes neutralized with Na+ and Mg2+ cations.
PSS–Mg2+ and PSS–Na+ exhibited
CO2/CH4 permselectivities of 65 and 49, respectively,
which was substantially higher than the value of 18 in the acidic
PPS–H+ form. Additionally, it was shown that the
CO2 permeability in PSS–Mg2+ increased
by only 9% between 1 and 7 atm, indicating that the membrane was less
prone to CO2 plasticization.21 Rhim et al. investigated the CO2/CH4 separation
properties in sulfonated poly(phenylene oxide) (SPPO) membranes cation-exchanged
with several mono-, di-, and trivalent cations. The trivalent SPPO–Al3+ membrane showed the highest enhancement in CO2/CH4 selectivity from 11 in the protonated form to 20
in the cation-exchanged polymer.25 Similar
results were obtained by Khan et al., who reported an increase in
the mixed-gas CO2/CH4 selectivity in an Al3+-neutralized sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) membrane
by approximately 62% to 19 compared with 11 in the protonated form.22 The enhanced selectivity was attributed to the
strong cross-linking effect of trivalent cations that hindered the
diffusivity of the larger-sized CH4 molecule more effectively
that CO2.

Interestingly, only a few studies reported
the gas separation performance
of cation-exchanged Nafion membranes. For example, Sakai et al. investigated
gas transport properties of a K+ cation-exchanged Nafion
membrane and showed that O2/N2 selectivity increased
from 2.2 to 7.4.37 Mohamed et al.
investigated the free volume and gas permeation properties of Nafion
Na+ and K+ cation-exchanged membranes.34 Their study demonstrated an increase in
free volume coupled with a decrease in O2 permeability
for the cation-exchanged Nafion membranes compared to the H+ form. This behavior was different from the general free volume
concept, where polymers with higher free volume typically exhibit
higher gas permeability.38,39 More recently,
Fan et al. studied Nafion H+ neutralized with monovalent
(Li+, Na+, K+) and divalent (Ca2+) cations to investigate the effect of ionic interaction
on the gas-transport properties.40 Their
study showed a higher gas permeability for cation-exchanged membranes
compared to Nafion H+ and suggested that the high gas solubility
of metal-ion-functionalized Nafion dominated gas permeation. Our group
recently reported the effect of CO2 plasticization on CO2/CH4 separation performance in Nafion H+.41 Despite low CO2 solubility
in Nafion H+ compared to conventional hydrocarbon polymers,42 binary mixed-gas experiments revealed that the
strong affinity of CO2 to the sulfonate groups caused a
large increase in segmental mobility, resulting in 40% reduction in
the CO2/CH4 selectivity from 26 to 15 by increasing
the CO2 partial pressure from 2 to 15 atm.

This study
investigated the physical modification of Nafion by
exchanging the H+ ions with trivalent Fe3+ cations.
It was anticipated that the cross-linking effect of Fe3+ could reduce the intersegmental mobility of Nafion, leading to improved
resistance toward undesirable penetrant-induced plasticization effects
under demanding CO2/CH4 gas mixture test conditions.
The Fe3+ cation-exchanged membrane was characterized by
wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA),
Raman spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR).
Pure-gas sorption, diffusion, and permeation properties of Nafion
Fe3+, as well as pressure-dependent mixture performance
using a 1:1 molar CO2/CH4 feed, are reported.

Results
and Discussion
Structural Properties of Fe3+ Ion-Exchanged
Nafion
Nafion H+ films (NRE 211) with thickness
of 25 μm
and equivalent weight of 1100 g equiv–1 were purchased
from Ion Power, Inc. Ion exchange was performed by soaking Nafion
H+ films in an aqueous 0.05 molar Fe(NO3)3 solution, as described in more detail in Experimental Section. The structures of Nafion H+ and Fe3+ ion-exchanged Nafion are shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Structure of Nafion H+ and Fe3+ ion-exchanged
Nafion.

The effect of cation exchange
on the microstructure of Nafion Fe3+ was qualitatively
assessed using the wide-angle X-ray diffraction
(WAXD) as illustrated in Figure 2. Similar to our previous study42 using Nafion H+, the spectrum showed a semicrystalline
behavior for Nafion Fe3+ membranes that was represented
by (i) a crystalline peak at 2θ = 17.7° and (ii) two amorphous
halo peaks at 2θ = 16.9 and 40.1°. The average interchain
spacings (d) were determined from Bragg’s
equation (d = λ/2 sin θ)
and are summarized in Table 1. Apparently, the interchain spacing in Nafion was only marginally
affected by cation exchange, consistent with previously reported WAXD
results for Nafion and other cation-exchanged polymers.40,43 Based on this result, it is very difficult to draw any clear conclusions
about the effects of interchain spacing on the gas-transport properties.
The only noticeable difference was the decrease in the crystallinity
from 11.4% in Nafion H+ to 6.3% in Nafion Fe3+, which was calculated by applying the Pearson VII distribution function.42 Such a change in crystallinity upon cation exchange
has been previously reported and influences the gas-transport properties
as the crystallites act as impermeable regions in the polymer.23,44

Figure 2 Microstructure
of Nafion Fe3+. The diffraction spectrum
was corrected for background scattering and the crystalline and amorphous
peaks were obtained by applying the Pearson VII distribution function.

The effects of cation exchange
on the thermal properties of Nafion
were analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The TGA profiles
of Nafion H+ and Nafion Fe3+ membranes are presented
in Figure 3a,b as percentage
weight loss and first-order derivatives, respectively.

Figure 3 TGA profile presented
as (a) percentage weight loss and (b) first-order
derivative of Nafion H+ (black) and Nafion Fe3+ (red) operated under N2 atmosphere at a heating rate
of 3 °C min–1.

Both Nafion types exhibited four decomposition stages between
100
and 600 °C. The first stage weight loss occurred between 100
and 280 °C. The gases evolved during this temperature range were
mostly water with trace amounts of SO2 and CO2 as identified using FT-IR.45 The second
stage weight loss occurred between 280 and 350 °C and according
to Wilkie et al. was primarily due to the release of SO2 and CO2 gases with minimal amount of water.45 SO2 evolved due to the cleavage of
C–S bonds, forming CF2, SO2, and OH radicals.45 Interestingly, the weight reduction (excluding
water loss) observed in Nafion H+ was ∼7%, whereas
the weight loss in the cation-exchanged Nafion Fe3+ was
only 1%, indicating that the stronger interaction between Fe3+ cations and the sulfonate anions prevented the cleavage of the C–S
bonds. The absence of the desulfonation process for Nafion cation-exchanged
membranes has been previously reported.40,45−48 The third stage weight loss occurred between 350 and 410 °C
in Nafion Fe3+, with a sharp decomposition temperature
peak at 400 °C, whereas in Nafion H+, the weight loss
occurred between 350 and 450 °C, with the peak maxima at 423
°C. This weight loss has been attributed to the degradation of
perfluoroalkylether side-chain groups of Nafion.46,48 The shift toward a lower degradation temperature in the Fe3+ ion-exchanged membrane corresponded to a decrease in thermal stability.
A similar trend was observed for an Al3+ ion-exchanged
Nafion membrane in which the decrease in the thermal stability was
attributed to the breaking of the perfluoroalkylether bonds catalyzed
by aluminum oxides that act as Lewis acids.46,48 Above ∼400 °C, the final decomposition of the poly(tetrafluoroethylene)
backbone began and continued until the polymer mass decomposed to
100% in Nafion H+ and 97.9% in Nafion Fe3+ at
600 °C.

TGA was also used to quantify the amount of water
lost from each
membrane type by measuring the kinetics of the dehydration process
at 80 °C, as illustrated in Figure 4. A period of ∼300 min was required
to reach an essentially dry state in both membrane types. This result
indicated that the Nafion films dried under vacuum for 2 days at 80
°C did not contain a significant amount of water when used for
the gas sorption and permeation tests.

lost as a function of time upon drying at 80 °C under inert N2 gas.

The Raman and FT-IR spectra
in Nafion H+ and Nafion
Fe3+ membranes are presented in Figure 5a,b, respectively. The spectra provide information
on the changes in the membrane microstructure (chain packing, ordering,
bond strength) by measuring the shift and broadening of the spectra
maxima.49 The maxima observed at 1057 (FT-IR)
and 1062 (Raman) for Nafion H+ corresponded to the symmetric
S–O stretching vibrations of the sulfonate group. The assignment
of this band has been reported in previous work.40,50−52 As shown, the maxima shifted toward a higher frequency
when the protons were exchanged with Fe3+ cations. The
shift in frequency is a qualitative indication of the bond strength
between the cation and the sulfonate anion. The strength of the ionic
interactions influences the flexibility of the polymer chains,27 which has a significant effect on the gas transport
properties, as discussed below.

of Nafion H+ and Nafion Fe3+ films. The black
dotted line is drawn
through the center of Nafion H+ maxima for visualizing
the relative frequency shift.

Pure-Gas-Transport Properties of Nafion Fe3+ Membrane
The permeabilities of pure gas He, H2, N2, O2, CH4, and CO2 and gas-pair
selectivities of Nafion Fe3+ membranes are summarized in Table 2. The permeabilities
of Nafion H+ membranes were determined in our previous
study under the same conditions and are reported here for comparison.42

The permeabilities
of the Fe3+ ion-exchanged membrane
followed the order He > H2 > CO2 >
O2 > N2 > CH4, indicative of
its strong size-dependent
permeation properties, qualitatively similar to the permeability behavior
of Nafion H+.42 The Fe3+ ion-exchanged membrane demonstrated a reduced permeability for all
the gases compared to the H+ type. Increased chain stiffness
due to interchain cross-linking could be a plausible cause to explain
the reduced permeability in the Fe3+ ion-exchanged membrane.
The significant 45% drop in CH4 permeability enhanced the
N2/CH4 selectivity from 2.9 to 4.0, CO2/CH4 selectivity from 28 to 35, and He/CH4 selectivity
from 446 to 733. The higher selectivity can be attributed to the strong
cross-linking effect by the trivalent Fe3+ cations that
stiffened the amorphous phase in Nafion and, thereby, hindered the
diffusivity of the larger-sized CH4 molecule more effectively
than that of the other gases.

To better understand the effect
of cation exchange on the gas-transport
properties of Nafion, the diffusivity and solubility data of the Fe3+ ion-exchanged film are compared with the previously measured
values of the Nafion H+ membrane in Table 3.42 The gas solubility
coefficients in the Nafion Fe3+ membrane were measured
using the gravimetric technique and the diffusivity coefficients were
then deduced from the relationship D = P/S. The gas solubilities followed the order of increasing
condensability: N2 < O2 < CH4 < CO2. The Nafion Fe3+ ion-exchanged membrane
demonstrated a ∼2–3-fold higher gas solubility values
compared to the Nafion H+ membrane. Similar solubility
enhancements have been reported for Nafion37,40 and other ionomers upon cation exchange.20,21 Fan et al. suggested that the high gas sorption in the cation-exchanged
Nafion membranes resulted from the large cation size that acted as
a spacer causing polymer chain expansion.40 Furthermore, the reduction in crystallinity in Nafion Fe3+ could have contributed to the enhanced gas solubility.

a Solubility (S)
values were obtained barometrically from a previous study.42 The corresponding diffusion (D) values were determined using D = P/S.

As
shown in Figures 6a–c,
the sorption isotherms in Nafion Fe3+ were
linear up to 20 atm, following Henry’s law. Both Nafion types
showed similar qualitative solubility trends; however, the solubilities
in Nafion Fe3+ were significantly higher than those in
Nafion H+ across the entire pressure range. Interestingly,
the isotherm for CO2 in Nafion Fe3+, as shown
in Figure 6d, was slightly
concave to the pressure axis, contrary to the linear CO2 isotherm for Nafion H+.42 Cross-linking
in Nafion induced by trivalent Fe3+ ions effectively reduced
the segmental mobility in the vicinity of ionic aggregations and possibly
created rigid regions consisting of fixed holes similar to glassy
polymers that provide additional sites for gas sorption. The observed
increase in glass transition temperature reported in Nafion28−30,34,35 and other ionomers32,33 upon cation-exchange supports
this hypothesis.

Figure 6 Sorption isotherms in Nafion Fe3+ (red) measured
gravimetrically
and Nafion H+ (black) measured barometrically42 at 35 °C: (a) N2; (b) O2; (c) CH4; and (d) CO2.

Pure-gas diffusion (D) coefficients
in Nafion
Fe3+ calculated from the ratio of permeability and the
directly measured gravimetric sorption data at 2 atm and 35 °C
are shown in Table 4. The Nafion Fe3+ ion-exchanged membrane showed lower
diffusivities compared to the Nafion H+ membrane. The extent
of these differences is significant: the diffusivity of CH4 in Nafion Fe3+ was ∼6 times lower than that in
Nafion H+. Multivalent cations are known to physically
cross-link the Nafion matrix by coordinating with sulfonate anions,
resulting in enhanced chain rigidity and, therefore, improved size-sieving
properties.21,22 The higher N2/CH4 and CO2/CH4 selectivity in Nafion Fe3+ was primarily due to its enhanced diffusivity selectivity,
as shown in Table 4.

Pressure-Dependant Pure-
and Mixed-Gas Permeation Properties
Pure-gas permeabilities
of CO2 and CH4 in
Nafion H+ and Fe3+ membranes are compared in Figure 7 as a function of
pressure at 35 °C. Across the entire pressure range investigated,
Nafion Fe3+ demonstrated lower CO2 and CH4 permeabilities compared to Nafion H+.

Figure 7 Pressure-dependent
pure-gas permeability of (a) CO2 and
(b) CH4 in Nafion H+ (black) and Nafion Fe3+ (red) at 35 °C.

Figure 7a
shows
that the pure CO2 permeability increased with pressure
for both Nafion types, which can be attributed to increased diffusivity.
Presumably, quadrupolar CO2 molecules interacted favorably
with the polar sulfonate groups of Nafion to increase its segmental
chain mobility, causing membrane plasticization.27,41,53,54 The Fe3+ ion-exchanged membrane was less affected by CO2 plasticization, as indicated by the smaller relative increase in
CO2 permeability compared to the Nafion H+ membrane.
Our previous work showed that pure CH4 permeability of
Nafion H+ decreased with increasing feed pressure, which
was caused by a decrease in gas diffusivity most likely due to chain
compression of the relatively flexible protonated ionomer.41 On the other hand, CH4 permeability
of Nafion Fe3+ remained essentially constant over the pressure
range of 2 to 15 atm (Figure 7b), which can be ascribed to its enhanced chain rigidity due
to cross-linking. The pure-gas CO2 and CH4 permeation
properties of both Nafion types indicated that CO2/CH4 selectivity increases with feed pressure. However, the opposite
trend was observed when the polymers were tested under mixed-gas conditions,
as discussed below.

Figure 8 compares
the permeabilities of CO2 and CH4 in Nafion
H+ and Nafion Fe3+ membranes tested with a 1:1
molar feed gas mixture as a function of pressure at 35 °C. These
mixture experiments are important to assess the membrane material
performance as CO2 tends to introduce nonideal effects
such as plasticization and competitive sorption, typically resulting
in different permeation behavior compared to pure-gas permeabilities.
In comparison to Nafion H+, CO2 mixture permeabilities
in Nafion Fe3+ were lower at all pressure points, as shown
in Figure 8a. It is
important to note that mixed-gas CO2 permeabilities in
Nafion Fe3+ were lower than their pure-gas values most
likely due to competitive sorption effects. As pressure increased
from 2 to 15 atm, mixed-gas CO2 permeability was only marginally
affected for Nafion H+ and Nafion Fe3+.

Figure 8 Mixed-gas permeabilities
of (a) CO2 and (b) CH4 in Nafion H+ (black) and Nafion Fe3+ (red)
as a function of CO2 partial pressure at 35 °C.

Mixed-gas CH4 permeabilities
in Nafion Fe3+ were lower than their pure-gas values across
the investigated pressure
range. As discussed above, competitive sorption and polymer chain
compression can explain this decrease. In comparison to Nafion H+, mixture CH4 permeabilities in Nafion Fe3+ were lower at all pressure points, as shown in Figure 8b. As the pressure increased
from 2 to 15 atm, the mixed-gas CH4 permeability in Nafion
Fe3+ increased by ∼30%, whereas that in Nafion H+ increased by 56%. The strong cross-linking in Nafion Fe3+ suppressed the CO2-induced increase in segmental
mobility more effectively compared to Nafion H+, and consequently
reduced plasticization.

Figure 9 compares
pure- and mixed-gas (1:1 molar feed ratio) CO2/CH4 selectivities in Nafion H+ and Nafion Fe3+ membranes. In the pure-gas experiment, Nafion Fe3+ showed
a higher CO2/CH4 selectivity with increased
feed pressure, similar to the trend previously observed for Nafion
H+, as shown in Figure 9a.41 The increased pure-gas
selectivity resulted from two effects: (i) increased CO2 permeability due to plasticization and (ii) reduction in CH4 permeability to chain compression.41 However, when tested under mixed-gas conditions, the dominant increase
in CH4 permeability due to CO2-induced plasticization
caused the mixed-gas CO2/CH4 selectivities to
decrease for both Nafion types. In comparison, Nafion Fe3+ exhibited a higher selectivity than Nafion H+ over the
entire pressure range. The mixture CO2/CH4 selectivity
of Nafion Fe3+ dropped by only 19% from 32 at 2 atm to
26 at 15 atm CO2 partial pressure. At typical natural gas
operating conditions (∼10 atm CO2 partial pressure),55,56 Nafion Fe3+ exhibited the mixed-gas CO2/CH4 selectivity of 28, which was 48% higher than the value of
19 obtained for Nafion H+. When compared to the most commonly
used membrane material for natural gas treatment, cellulose triacetate,
Nafion Fe3+ had a slightly higher CO2/CH4 selectivity (28 vs 25) but a lower CO2 permeability
(1.1 vs 8 Barrer), which may limit its commercial potential for CO2/CH4 separations.

feed ratio) CO2/CH4 selectivity in Nafion H+ (black)41 and Nafion Fe3+ (red) membranes as

Conclusions
The
physical and gas-transport properties of Nafion complexed with
trivalent Fe3+ cations were investigated. The physical
cross-linking in Nafion Fe3+ resulted in high pure-gas
N2/CH4 and CO2/CH4 permselectivity
of 4.0 and 35, respectively, compared to the values of 2.9 and 28
in Nafion H+. This was attributed to the strong ionic interactions
between Fe3+ cations and sulfonate anions that caused chain
stiffening leading to enhanced diffusivity selectivities. High-pressure
gas solubility measurements showed linear solubility isotherms for
N2, O2, and CH4 and a slightly concave
isotherm for CO2, potentially indicative of the existence
of microvoids that created additional sorption sites. Consequently,
the gas solubilities in Nafion Fe3+ were higher than those
in Nafion H+. Binary mixed-gas experiments demonstrated
that physical cross-linking via trivalent Fe3+ cations
was an effective approach to reduce the high-solubility CO2-induced plasticization of Nafion. At a typical natural gas feed
CO2 partial pressure of 10 atm, Nafion Fe3+ exhibited
a CO2/CH4 selectivity of 28 compared to 19 in
Nafion H+.

Experimental Section
Materials
Nafion
NRE 211 films with the thickness of
25 μm and the equivalent weight of 1100 g equiv–1 were purchased from Ion Power, Inc., in the H+ form.
Before the Fe3+ exchange, the as-received Nafion H+ membranes were first washed with distilled water to remove
any surface impurities. Next, the films were immersed in an aqueous
Fe(NO3)3 solution of 0.05 molar concentration.
The exchange process was monitored using a pH meter until the pH value
stabilized. To ensure complete ion exchange, the films were then stored
in the solution for at least 10 days. The wet films were gently wiped
with soft tissue paper to remove any excess solution from the surface.
The films were air dried for 12 h by sandwiching between two filter
papers and then dried under high vacuum at 80 °C for 2 days before
testing. The film density of Nafion Fe3+ was 2.14 g cm–3 ± 1% using a mass-volumetric technique by accurately
measuring the weight, area, and thickness of dry samples.

Polymer Characterization
and Methods
Wide-angle X-ray
diffraction (WAXD) measurements were conducted on a Bruker D8 Advance
diffractometer.42 The thermal stability
of Nafion H+ and Fe3+ samples was investigated
on a TA instrument 2950 thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) in a nitrogen
atmosphere. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectra
were obtained with a Varian 670-IR spectrometer. Raman spectra of
Nafion H+ and Nafion Fe3+ were collected on
a LabRAM ARAMIS (Horiba Jobin Yvon, Inc.) instrument.

Pure-Gas Solubility
and Permeation Tests
The gas solubility
of Nafion Fe3+ was measured using a Hiden Intelligent Gravimetric
Analyzer (IGA-003, Hiden Isochema, U.K.) as previously described.41 Pure-gas permeabilities at 35 °C were determined
with a custom-designed constant volume/variable pressure test system.42

Mixed-Gas Permeation Tests
The mixed-gas
permeation
experiments were performed at 35 °C with a feed gas containing
50 vol % CH4/50 vol % CO2 at total pressures
ranging from 4 to 30 atm following a method described by O’Brien
et al.57 and applied in our previous work.41
