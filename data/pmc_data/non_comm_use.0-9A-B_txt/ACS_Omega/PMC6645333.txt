Spin-dependent
effects in organic solar cells (OSCs) are responsible
for tuning the electric current when an external magnetic field is
applied. Here, we report the magnetic field effect (MFE) on wide-bandgap
(WBG) solar cells based on the polymers PBDT(O)-T1 and PBDT(Se)-T1
blended with PC70BM. Furthermore, we propose an experimental
method based on the electrical transport (i–V) measurements to unveil the negative magneto conductance
(MC) at small bias. The observed curves in a double-logarithmic scale
display a particular S-like shape, independent of the OSC power conversion
efficiency (PCE) or MC amplitudes. Additionally, from the slope of
the S-like shape curve, it is possible to identify the fullerene concentrations
that would result in the minimum MC and the maximum PCE. Our work
opens up a door to find more patterns to describe MFE and PCE in polymer–fullerene
solar cells, without the application of external magnetic or luminous
sources.

1 Introduction
Organic
devices have drawn great interest because of its promising
capacities compared to inorganic semiconductors in photovoltaic applications,
regardless of their limitations in power conversion efficiency (PCE)
and stability. Their long spin diffusion length makes them attractive
and promising in the field of organic spintronics to transfer and
process information.

The magneto conductance (MC) describes
the spin-dependent effects
(SDEs) or magnetic field effects (MFEs) in organic solar cells (OSCs).1−21 It has been characterized by Lorentzian line shape curves.22 The MC curve can be divided into three regions
that correspond to an ultra-small field effect (USFE) upto ∼10
mT, low field effect (LFE) upto ∼300 mT, and high field effect
(HFE) from ∼300 mT onwards.11,19 Exploring
the MC in organic devices has been a motivation for experimental and
theoretical studies.5−22

SDEs have been found in OSCs composed of poly(9,9-dioctylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl)
(PFO),23 P3HT:PCBM,24,53 and MDMO-PPV:PCBM.25 Recently, wide-bandgap
(WBG) polymers have attracted much attention due to their important
applications in multiple junction OSCs.37,38 In Alq3 light-emitting diodes,39−45 the electrically injected current was increased by up to 5% after
the application of an external magnetic field.5 Different mechanisms have been proposed relying on the spin-dependent
interactions.31−33

The spin-dependent interactions between charged
particles will
result in different effects on the electric current that flows through
the organic device. First, within the bipolaron mechanism,31,51,54−69 the reaction between particles of the same electric charge takes
effect between one quasistationary and another nearby free carrier.
The respective alignment of the spins is important during the interaction.
According to the Pauli exclusion principle, this event is more likely
to occur for a pair of charges in a singlet configuration than in
a triplet state. At low magnetic fields, the random hyperfine field46 mixes the spin states of the charged particles
lifting the spin blocking, whereas at high magnetic fields, the hyperfine
field interaction is overruled and the spin blocking is regained.
As a consequence, the magnetic field dependence of the bipolaron mechanism
leads to a negative effect on the MC.25,70

Second,
the e–h mechanism proposed by Prigodin et al.32 indicates that electron–hole precursor
pairs can dissociate to form free polarons or recombine after the
formation of the exciton. If these reactions are spin selective,48 it is possible to consider different recombination
rates for singlet and triplet states. Because there is an internal
competition between dissociation and recombination, the application
of an external magnetic field overrules the hyperfine interactions
resulting in less mixing and giving rise to a positive MC.32 The performance of the polymer–fullerene
solar cells is closely dependent on the amount of PCBM (fullerene)
blended in the organic layer.52 The electric current in the polymer–fullerene solar cells is
increased, indicating the efficient dissociation of electron–hole
(e–h) precursor pairs and leading to the highest PCE.34−36 Under this scenario, the most likely mechanism that governs the
SDE is the e–h mechanism. It is important to mention that at
HFE, the polarons will have a slightly different g-factor. As a result, additional spin mixing occurs at large fields,
referred to as the Δg-mechanism.25

Last, we will discuss the triplet–polaron
mechanism. Because
triplets have longer lifetime compared to singlets, an increased population
of triplets, as a result of the magnetic field enhanced intersystem crossing (ISC) process, can boost the
free charge generation, resulting in a positive MC. In other words,
the average dissociation rate decreases (negative MC) with the increase
of triplets and the diffusion rate increases (positive MC). Therefore,
the negative and positive values of the MC comprise both components
due to dissociation and diffusion. In the triplet–polaron mechanism,
the hyperfine field is responsible for spin mixing,19 which plays an important role in the LFE (between singlet
and triplets) and the HFE (between doublets and quadruplets) regions
of the MC curve.25

The random recombination
of electron and hole spin polarization
of the injected current statistically yields a ratio of 1:3 in organic
materials.26,27 After the application of an external
magnetic field, the singlet and triplet recombination ratio can change,
affecting the electric current through the device28,29 and resulting in a positive or negative MC.6,30 The
separation distance between electron and holes in the polymer–fullerene
blend is critical to detect the presence of SDE. Several studies have
been performed to measure the MFE in OSCs with the application of
external magnetic fields. In this manuscript, we propose a novel method
to identify, the negative MC at small bias, and obtain the fullerene
concentrations for the minimum MC and maximum PCE. This proposal is
based on the electrical transport (i–V) curves obtained at different fullerene concentrations.
We conjecture that the curve patterns, such as the shape and slope,
offer information about the fullerene concentration for the smallest
MC and the maximum PCE without the application of external magnetic
or luminous sources.

Here, we fabricate the polymer–fullerene
WBG solar cells
PBDT(O)-T1 and PBDT(Se)-T1, blended with the fullerene PC70BM to investigate the MC in the dark and the PCE amplitudes under
illumination at different fullerene concentrations and applied voltages.
Then, we modify the electron transport layer (ETL) and the hole transport
layer (HTL) for both solar cells and kept the active layer at 50%
of fullerene concentration to measure the MC and the PCE. Additionally,
electrical transport (i–V) measurements are obtained without the application of external magnetic
fields or illumination in different configurations and fullerene concentrations.
There have been similar studies for tuning the MC in OSCs,25 however in this manuscript, we focus on two
new polymers blended with the fullerene PC70BM and propose
a novel method to investigate the MC and the PCE without the use of
external magnetic or luminous sources.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 MC in PBDT(O)-T1:PC70BM Solar Cell
We measured the MC as a function of
external magnetic field, fullerene
concentration, and applied bias voltage in the polymer–fullerene
solar cell PBDT(O)-T1:PC70BM shown in Figure 1. The current density was set
at ∼6 mA mm–2. In Figure 2, we observe the MC at three fullerene concentrations:
(a) 25, (b) 50, and (c) 75%. In Figure 2a, we note a positive USFE and LFE that reaches a plateau
after ∼300 mT. Moreover, in Figure 2b, we observe both USFE and LFE positives,
whereas in the HFE region the MC becomes negative. Finally, in Figure 2c, the MC follows
the same trend as the OSC at 25% of fullerene concentration. Notably,
for all the measurements, it is observed that the USFE and LFE remain
positive for all concentrations when the applied voltage is higher
than the built-in voltage.

cell. (a) Molecular structure and (b) device structure under investigation.

Figure 2 The MC in PBDT(O)-T11–x:PC70BMx at three different
concentrations
(a) x = 25%, (b) x = 50%, and (c)
at x = 75%. The electric current was set at similar
values for all the concentrations. The applied voltage was set to
be higher than the built-in voltage. (See Figure S1 in the Supporting Information for more details about
the MC at other fullerene concentrations).

Figure 3a
(on the
left side of the y-axis) reproduces the MC at 1T
measured at different fullerene concentrations. We can observe that
the smallest value of MC corresponds to the fullerene concentration
of 65% and reaches an oscillatory state beyond 75%. We also measured
the MC when the applied voltage changes from a higher to a lower value
compared to the built-in voltage. In Figure 3b, “Yes” denotes the change
from positive to negative MC only at particular fullerene concentrations.

the maximum value of the MCat 1T. (b) Sign change

2.2 MC in PBDT(O)-T1:PC70BM Solar Cells
To examine the electrical transport (i–V curve) under illumination at different fullerene concentrations,
PCE measurements were performed. We return to Figure 3a (right side of the y-axis),
where we observe different rates of change in the PCE curve that correlates
with different morphology regions in the polymer–fullerene
solar cell.15,25,47,50

The PCE curve can be divided into
two intervals, the first from 0 to 50% and the second from 50 to 95%.
The maximum PCE was obtained at 50% fullerene concentration, and it
is considered as the inflection point. In the first interval, after
starting with a negligible value at 0% fullerene concentration due
to quenching sites of excitons,25 the rate
of change in the PCE as a function of fullerene concentration is positive,
reaching the maximum value at 50% of fullerene concentration.

The maximum value of the PCE is ascribed to the balance in the
generation and the transfer of excitons and extraction of polarons.
As the fullerene concentration increases beyond 50%, the rate of change
turns to negative. In the interval of 50–95%, the PCEs decay
owing to the imbalance of holes with respect to the electrons in the
active layer and the fullerene aggregation dominated by single-carrier
electron and hole currents.15,47

2.3 Analysis
of the MC and PCE in PBDT(O)-T1:PC70BM Solar Cells
As reported in Section 1, the MC curve displays three regions. In
this section, we will focus only on the HFE region obtained at 1 T,
which is plotted in Figure 3a. According to the horizontal axis, the MC curve can be divided
into three regions with respect to the fullerene concentrations, the
first one located between 0 and 50%, the second between 50 and 65%,
and the third in the interval of 75–95%. On the other hand,
the PCE curve in Figure 3a is divided into two regions with respect to the fullerene concentration,
the first one from 0 to 50% and the second from 50 to 95%.

First,
at the beginning of the first region (0% of fullerene concentration),
the imbalance of charge carriers allows the solar cell to act as a
single-carrier device. Under this scenario, dissociation of charge
carriers becomes an unlikely event for PCE. The electrically injected
current spin polarizations statistically yields the singlet and triplet
ratios of 1:3,26,27 where triplet excitonic states
densities are higher for their long triplet lifetime.25 Therefore, the triplet-polaron33,75 mechanism becomes the most likely candidate to explain the positive
USFE, LFE, and HFE in the first region.

Second, when the content
of fullerene is increased up to 50%, the
fullerene is homogeneously distributed throughout the polymer PBDT(O)-T1,15 providing an ideal scenario for an electron–hole
pair formation as well as charge dissociation. Indeed, the high PCE
corroborates this statement. We notice that the PCE reaches the maximum
value at 50% of fullerene concentration. However, at smaller or higher
fullerene concentrations, the PCE decreases because of the imbalance
of the secondary generated charge carriers and the morphological changes
due to different fullerene concentrations.38 Based on this observation, we suggest the electron–hole mechanism32 to be responsible for the positive USFE and
LFE in the region. It is remarkable to mention that passing through
50 and 65% of fullerene concentration, the HFE becomes negative. We
assume that this change is caused by the Δg-mechanism as a fingerprint of an appropriate generation and dissociation
of charged carriers and the new spin mixing that takes place.

Finally, in the region beyond 65%, the imbalance of charge carriers
due to the increasing concentration and aggregation of fullerene,
separates the solar cell into two phases, performing as a single charge
carrier device.15,47,50 In this region, the PCE decreases as the concentration of fullerene
increases due to intermolecular interactions and diminished dissociation
of charged particles. The charge transport of the single charge carrier
device dominates this process. Once again, triplet exciton densities
can be very high because of the long triplet lifetime of the electrically
injected current that competes with the limited dissociation of charge
carriers. We suggest the triplet–polaron mechanism as a likely
candidate for the positive USFE, LFE, and HFE at concentrations beyond
75%.

After suggesting the mechanisms responsible for line shapes
in Figure 3a, we analyzed
the
origin of the signs in the three regions of the MC curves. For that,
we recall Figure 2.
In the USFE region, a competition between the low external magnetic
field and the hyperfine field interaction that degenerate the triplet
states20,71,73,74 leads to the suppression of intersystem crossing
(ISC) between singlet and triplet polaron pairs. As a consequence,
the sign of the MC in this region will be determined by the spin-dependent
interaction of the elements in the active layer of the OSCs, where
the spin–orbit coupling (SOC) plays an important role, especially
when heavy organic elements such as selenium are present. In our experiment,
the weak nature of the SOC of oxygen in the PBDT(O)-T1 polymer is
overruled by the external magnetic field, leading to a positive MC
at all concentrations. For the LFE and HFE regions, the sign of the
MC is ascribed to the intermolecular secondary charges collected by
the OSC electrodes, where processes such as ISC between singlet and
triplet states will affect the charge carrier population owing to
different recombination and dissociation rates leading to a positive
MC in the LFE region when the applied voltage is higher than the built-in
voltage and a negative MC when the applied voltage is smaller than
the built-in voltage. Moreover, in the HFE region, different Lande factors for e–h pairs lead to the enhancement
of ISC at 50 and 65% of fullerene concentration.25,71,72

In the following section, we report
the results of the MC and PCE
measurements in a second solar cell based on the polymer PBDT(Se)-T1
at 50% of fullerene concentration. Its molecular structure differs
only in one atom with respect to PBDT(O)-T1, as can be seen in Supporting Information Figure S2. Furthermore,
we measure the electrical transport (i–V) curves without external sources of illumination or magnetic
fields for both OSCs.

3 Double-Logarithmic Current–Voltage
(i–V) Curves in PBDT(O)-T1:PC70BM and PBDT(Se)-T1:PC70BM
Different fullerene
concentrations cause different amplitudes for
the MC and PCE in the OSCs. Moreover, we investigated the possibility
to describe the MC and PCE prior to the use of external sources such
as magnetic fields or illumination. For that, we examined in detail
the electrical transport (i–V) curves in a double-logarithmic scale.

In Figure 4, we
observed the complete set of (i–V) measurements at all concentrations in PBDT(O)-T1:PC70BM. It can be seen that samples at 50, 65, 75 and 85% fullerene concentration
exhibit an S-like shape with a typical plateau in the first region
of the curve.23,49 Strikingly, in Figure 3b, the sign of the MC is negative
only at these concentrations when the applied voltage was smaller
than the built-in voltage (small bias). We consider that the plateau
in the first region of the S-like shape curve is a signature of negative
MC. Besides, the most pronounced slope of the S-like shape curve in
the exponential region coincides with the device at minimum MC magnitude
that was found to be at 65% of fullerene concentration. Additionally,
from Figure 4, it is
possible to identify the curve that corresponds to the device with
the maximum PCE that corresponds to the sample at 50% of fullerene
concentration.

Figure 4 Double-logarithmic current–voltage (i–V) curves in PBDT(O)T11–x:PC70BMx at
different fullerene
concentrations. Note the characteristic plateau in the first region
of the curves at fullerene concentrations in the range of 50–85%
as a fingerprint of negative MFE at small bias. The curve with the
most pronounced slope (mmMFE) indicates the OSC with the minimum MFE.
On the other hand, the curve with the slope (mMPCE) indicates the
OSC with the maximum PCE. By inspection of the family of curves obtained
at different fullerene concentrations, it is possible to identify
the fullerene concentration for the minimum MC, the maximum PCE, and
negative MC at small bias.

It is appropriate to mention that the curves have been obtained
only from the electrical transport (i–V) measurements without the application of any external
magnetic field or illumination. To verify whether the characteristic
S-like shape and the plateau provide the same information in a solar
cell where oxygen (O) is replaced by (Se), we replaced the polymer
PBDT(O)-T1 by PBDT(Se)-T1 and kept the fullerene content at 50%.38

Proceeding in the same way as PBDT(O)-T1,
we performed the MC,
PCE, and electrical transport (i–V) measurements. The reported PCE in PBDT(Se)-T1 was 8.4% compared
to 4% in PBDT(O)-T1, whereas the MCat 1T in PBDT(Se)-T1 reported 0.02%
compared to 0.07% in PBDT(O)-T1. Strikingly, regardless of these differences
in MC and PCE, the double-logarithmic current–voltage (i–V) curve of the electrical transport
(i–V) measurements revealed
the S-like shape in both devices. (See Figure S3 in the Supporting Information to compare the double-logarithmic
current–voltage (i–V) for both OSCs). When measuring the MC at small bias in PBDT(Se)-T1,
we also found it to be negative, as reported in PBDT(O)-T1. We must
point out that the SOC due to the element selenium plays an important
role in the USFE in the PBDT(Se)-T1 polymer. The strong SOC of selenium
affects the hyperfine coupling interaction, leading to a negative
MC. Under these experimental findings, we conjecture that the plateau
in the first region of the S-like shape curve is a signature of negative
MC in OSCs at small bias and the most pronounced slope unravels the
OSCs with the smallest MC when the family of curves is investigated
at different fullerene concentrations.

To verify the role of
the electron transport layer (ETL) and the
hole transport layer (HTL) in the characteristic S-like shape, we
replaced the ETL and HTL to obtain the electrical transport (i–V) curves in several configurations
at 50% of fullerene concentration. (See Figures S4 and S5 in the Supporting Information). Surprisingly, we confirm
that the plateau in the first region of the S-like shape is present
only in devices that display a negative MC at small bias. Under this
evidence, we conjecture that the S-like shape curve is independent
of the ETL or HTL of the OSCs and the chemical composition of the
polymer. Once more, we confirmed that the plateau in the first region
of the S-like shape curve is a fingerprint of negative MC.

4 Conclusion
We presented the experimental results of
the magnetic field effects
(MFEs) in the OSCs based on the polymers PBDT(O)-T1 and PBDT(Se)-T1
blended with the fullerene PC70BM. From the electrical
transport (i–V) curves in
a double-logarithmic scale, the characteristic S-like shape and the
plateau in the first region of the curve unveil a negative MC at small
bias. Furthermore, the slopes of the curves provide information about
the OSCs with the maximum PCE and the minimum MC independent of the
MC and PCE amplitudes and active layer and injection layer structures.
Our work opens up a door to find more patterns to describe the MFE
and PCE in polymer–fullerene solar cells, without the use of
external magnetic fields or illumination.

5 Experimental
Section
To explore the electrical transport (i–V) curves, we analyze the MC in the OSC
benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene
(BDT)-based
copolymer (PBDT(O)-T1) blended with the fullerene PC70BM.38 The molecular and device structures are shown
in Figure 1. The PC70BM fullerene has been introduced to the polymer PBDT(O)-T1
in various concentrations. The PCE and MC were measured at room temperature,
different fullerene concentrations and applied bias voltages. Furthermore,
the electrical transport (i–V) measurements were performed and analyzed in the form of double-logarithmic
current–voltage (i–V) curves. Finally, a second solar cell benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT)-based copolymer
PBDT(Se)-T1 blended with the fullerene PC70BM was electrically
characterized, and the values of PCE, MC, and double-logarithmic current–voltage
(i–V) at 50% of fullerene
concentration were compared to the values of PBDT(O)-T1 (see supplementary
note 1 in the Supporting Information for
more details).
