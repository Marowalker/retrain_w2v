We
used high-throughput experimental screening methods to unveil
the physical and chemical properties of Mn1–xZnxO wurtzite alloys and identify
their appropriate composition for effective water splitting application.
The Mn1–xZnxO thin films were synthesized using combinatorial pulsed
laser deposition, permitting for characterization of a wide range
of compositions with x varying from 0 to 1. The solubility
limit of ZnO in MnO was determined using the disappearing phase method
from X-ray diffraction and X-ray fluorescence data and found to increase
with decreasing substrate temperature due to kinetic limitations of
the thin-film growth at relatively low temperature. Optical measurements
indicate the strong reduction of the optical band gap down to 2.1
eV at x = 0.5 associated with the rock salt-to-wurtzite
structural transition in Mn1–xZnxO alloys. Transmission electron microscopy results
show evidence of a homogeneous wurtzite alloy system for a broad range
of Mn1–xZnxO compositions above x = 0.4. The wurtzite Mn1–xZnxO samples with the
0.4 < x < 0.6 range were studied as anodes
for photoelectrochemical water splitting, with a maximum current density
of 340 μA cm–2 for 673 nm-thick films. These
Mn1–xZnxO films were stable in pH = 10, showing no evidence of photocorrosion
or degradation after 24 h under water oxidation conditions. Doping
Mn1–xZnxO materials with Ga dramatically increases the electrical conductivity
of Mn1–xZnxO up to ∼1.9 S/cm for x = 0.48, but these
doped samples are not active in water splitting. Mott–Schottky
and UPS/XPS measurements show that the presence of dopant atoms reduces
the space charge region and increases the number of mid-gap surface
states. Overall, this study demonstrates that Mn1–xZnxO alloys hold promise
for photoelectrochemical water splitting, which could be enhanced
with further tailoring of their electronic properties.

Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting
is one of the options
for sustainable hydrogen production. Photoactive semiconductors are
critical for the development of PEC water splitting technologies.
In particular, the choice of an efficient n-type semiconductor photoanode
material is a long-standing objective for PEC solar cell design. The
key requirements for a single semiconductor to perform efficient water
splitting can be summarized as follows: a band gap in the range of
1.5–2.0 eV (taking into account the 1.23 eV water dissociation
energy and overpotential losses), band edge positions that straddle
the water oxidation and reduction potentials, chemical and electrochemical
stability in the operating environment under illumination, fast transport
of the photogenerated carriers, high conversion efficiency, and low
cost.1−5 Such moderate-band gap semiconductors can be also coupled with a
suitable low-band gap semiconductor for applications in PEC tandem
solar cells that could potentially lead to higher solar-to-hydrogen
conversion efficiencies.

Transition-metal oxides are promising
candidates for water splitting
because of their low cost and excellent stability in aqueous environments.
However, many transition-metal oxides reported in the literature suffer
from one of the following problems: their band gaps are too large
for efficient light absorption, their band edges do not align with
Nernst potentials for water oxidation/reduction, the materials are
highly susceptible to chemical dissolution (especially under localized
acidic conditions), and/or they exhibit poor semiconducting properties.
For example, TiO2 is the most widely studied photoelectrode
material, but its wide band gap (∼3 eV) severely limits its
efficiency for PEC fuel generating applications unless interfaced
with low-band gap semiconductors at either an anode or cathode.6−9 Exciting progress has been made over the past years on alternative
binary oxide materials such as ZnO,10 WO3,11 Fe2O3,12 Cu2O,13 NiO,14 Ta2O5,15 Nb2O5,16 etc. However, most of these materials also suffer
from intrinsic limitations for PEC applications, especially related
to corrosion or to their band edges, which are not well aligned for
the production of hydrogen. BiVO4 has also shown promise
as a photoanode material,17 but this material
is still prone to photocorrosion and its performance is often limited
by poor electron transport and by surface recombination.18−20 Therefore, new semiconductors need to be discovered and developed
with specific functional attributes including band gap, band edge
alignment, and improved transport properties.

Our computational
research on d5 transition-metal oxides
has shown the possibility of creating semiconducting manganese(II)
oxide (MnO).21 This MnO compound can exist
in the rock salt (RS) or wurtzite (WZ) structures. The WZ structure
is metastable compared to the RS structure, which is the ground state.
However, the RS structure presents a large band gap (3.5 eV) and self-trapping
of holes, whereas the WZ structure is predicted to have an appropriate
band gap (2.1 eV) for water splitting and band-like hole transport
instead of hopping. Hence, the question arises on how to make MnO
structurally stable in the wurtzite phase and therefore take full
advantage of its properties for water splitting applications.

It is well known that the properties of a semiconductor can be
tuned through alloying, that is, substitution of one element for another
at tens of percent level. There are several reports in the literature
on MnO doping in ZnO that focused on substitution of only a few percent
of Mn for Zn. These studies focused mainly on the structural, electronic,
and magnetic properties of thin films fabricated by sputtering,22 pulsed laser deposition,23−25 and molecular
beam epitaxy.26 However, there are only
few reports with a particular emphasis on the alloying of MnO with
ZnO and/or their application in water splitting. One experimental
study27 looked at the interaction of MnO
and ZnO at different temperatures and pressures and determined the
experimental conditions at which Mn1–xZnxO (0.3 < x < 0.7) was formed in the rock salt structure. Another paper has
reported on rock salt MnO:ZnO microflowers (5% of Mn ions in the ZnO
matrix), finding that the emission of F+ centers at the
oxygen vacancies could enhance the performance of the material in
water splitting.28 Other theoretical studies
have demonstrated that MnO:ZnO alloys (Mn1–xZnxO) could potentially be used
for water splitting,29−32 reporting on tunability of the band gap,29 efficiency of different n- and p-type dopants,30 overpotential for water photo-oxidation on (001) surfaces,31 and their interfaces with water32 but all assuming the rock salt structure of Mn1–xZnxO.

Our recent
calculations showed that ZnO is a favorable candidate
for stabilizing MnO in the wurtzite structure and this structure has
promising properties for water splitting applications.33 We predicted the band line up, dopability, and
absorption in the visible region for wurtzite Mn1–xZnxO. We also predicted
the structure transition of Mn1–xZnxO from RS to WZ (above x = 0.3) with favorable electron and hole transport properties and
suitable physical properties for water splitting. This recently published
theoretical work also includes some preliminary experimental results
on wurtzite Mn1–xZnxO alloys for water splitting.33 In a more recent publication, we have also shown how this
basic Mn1–xZnxO work led to a new understanding of phase diagrams for
heterostructural semiconductor alloys.34 This new understanding offers a route for predicting the properties
of other heterostructural semiconductor alloys and opens up opportunities
in the development of new materials with desired functionalities.35

In this paper, we present detailed results
on the fabrication,
characterization, and application of wurtzite Mn1–xZnxO alloys for water
splitting. We use high-throughput combinatorial synthesis, measurement,
and analysis methodologies to rapidly screen the composition–structure–property
relationships of Mn1–xZnxO alloys and identify candidate samples for
a more detailed study in PEC applications. TEM measurements are reported
to demonstrate the homogeneity and structure of the fabricated alloys.
Mott–Schottky measurements are used to determine the flat band
potential, space charge layer, and carrier concentration of the samples.
In addition, measurements of this material for water splitting applications
are performed as a function of Zn atomic composition, pH, thickness,
and Ga doping. These PEC measurements show that undoped samples exhibit
a photoresponse current, while heavy doping inhibits the photoresponse
due to decreased space charge layer and surface defect states suggested
by photoemission spectroscopy.

Results
Structural Properties
Depending on the substrate deposition
temperature (T), oxygen partial pressure (pO2), and chemical environment, the manganese
oxide system can exist in a variety of oxidation states including
MnO [Mn(II)], Mn2O3 [Mn(III)], Mn3O7 [Mn(II,III)], MnO2 [Mn(IV)], MnO3 [Mn(VI)], and Mn2O7 [Mn(VII)], with a number
of possible polymorphs for each composition. However, the oxidation
state for Mn we are interested in here is +2 as in MnO, since it is
relevant to Mn1–xZnxO alloys. Therefore, prior to depositing combinatorial
libraries of Mn1–xZnxO alloys, we need to identify the processing conditions
that allow synthesizing MnO single-phase samples in the correct oxidation
state. This is done by varying both the total pressure (PTotal) and the oxygen pressure (pO2) during depositions as a function of the substrate temperature
gradient obtained on a combinatorial heater. An analysis of the X-ray
diffraction peaks allows the determination of various crystalline
structures of known oxidation states as a function of pO2, PTotal, and temperature.

A synthesis map determined from XRD patterns is presented in Figure 1, along with the
representative XRD patterns of Mn–O in different oxidation
states. A rock salt single-phase (face-centered cubic, JCPDS #07–0230)
of MnO is obtained using a fixed PTotal of 5 mTorr and pO2 of 10–5 Torr over a substrate temperature (TS) range of 250–650 °C. The results show that a pO2 < 10–5 Torr and PTotal < 5 mTorr are needed to grow rock salt
MnO. A mixture of MnO and Mn3O4, pure Mn3O4, and a mixture of Mn2O3 and Mn3O4 appear successively as a function
of PTotal and/or pO2 increase. Single-phase ZnO (JCPDS #653411) was also obtained
at the same condition as the single-phase MnO.

maps obtained by XRD of the Mn–O
system at (a) different total pressures as a function of substrate
temperature and (b) different oxygen pressures as a function of substrate
temperature. (c) Representative XRD patterns of the different phases,
with the same color code as in (a) and (b). Note that the phase of
interest, MnO, is in dark green.

Experimental XRD maps for typical Mn1–xZnxO alloy samples deposited
at
381 and 519 °C and at different MnO concentrations are shown
in Figure 2. Different
crystalline phases are observed as a function of ZnO concentration
at 381 °C, including rock salt (RS) at low x, wurtzite (WZ) at high x, and a mixture of RS and
WZ at intermediate x. At x <
0.2, a shift of the (111) and (002) RS peak positions is observed
with increasing ZnO composition (x), indicating that
Zn ions substitute Mn sites without changing the RS crystal structure.
The (002) WZ peak in the Mn1–xZnxO alloy starts appearing at around x = 0.2 and coexists with the RS peaks up to x =
0.2. Substituting Mn with Zn at x > 0.4 caused
a
position shift of the (002) WZ peak to shift to higher angles. Correspondingly,
the c-axis lattice constant of the wurtzite Mn1–xZnxO
alloy thin films is elongated with increasing Zn composition.

Figure 2 (a, b) XRD
scans of Mn1–xZnxO alloys with different x values
deposited at (a) 381 °C and (b) 519 °C, leading to different
rock salt (RS), wurtzite, (WZ), and mixture (WZ + RS) phases. The
RS peaks at 35–36° (111) and 40–41°o (200) and the WZ peak at 34–35° (002) are clearly visible.

To determine the position of a
phase boundary at a particular temperature
on the Mn1–xZnxO synthesis diagrams, we use the disappearing phase method.
For example, the inset of Figure 3 shows an example of the use of the disappearing phase
method to determine the RS/(WZ + RS) phase boundary at 260 °C.
In this specific case, the phase boundary location in the Mn1–xZnxO alloy is found at x = 0.15, where the WZ XRD peak intensity extrapolates to
zero. The composition–temperature phase boundaries that correspond
to the solubility limit of Mn in the WZ structure and Zn in the RS
structure in Figure 3 are obtained by repeating the disappearing phase analysis at each
studied temperature. From the synthesis phase diagram determined over
the 180–520 °C temperature range, the solubilities of
Mn in the WZ structure and Zn in the RS structure are found to decrease
with increasing temperature. Hence, the width of the two-phase WZ
+ RS region (miscibility gap) increases with increasing temperature.
From the thermodynamic point of view, this result may seem unusual,
because the miscibility gap is expected to close with increasing temperature
due to entropic contributions. This unexpected observation can be
explained by kinetic limitations during the thin-film growth, where
long-range phase separation is inhibited at low substrate temperatures
(200–500 °C), as discussed in more detail in our previous
works on Mn1–xZnxO33,34 and related alloys.35−37

the disappearing phase method used to determine the WZ/RS phase boundary
at 260 °C.

The TEM analysis of the
film microstructure is shown in Figure 4. Bright-field TEM
imaging (Figure 4a)
of the Mn0.48Zn0.52O film illustrates a uniform
film thickness and columnar microstructure over the 20 μm-wide
field of view analyzed in the FIB prepared cross section. As seen
in the (01-10) dark-field image (Figure 4b) and the corresponding selected area diffraction
pattern (Figure 4c),
the grain structure of the Mn0.48Zn0.52O film
is highly oriented toward (0001) with 10 to 30 nm grains rotated about
this axis. The diffraction pattern also shows a single phase that
indexes well to the wurtzite-type structure. High-resolution imaging
of the film (Figure 4d) again illustrates the highly oriented film structure with grain
rotations about the 0001 direction. Z-contrast scanning TEM (STEM)
imaging was completed using a high-angle dark field (Figure 5a) of the film cross section,
and the image illustrates no local changes in elemental distribution.
The lack of changes in elemental chemistry is correlated by the EDS
spectral image shown in Figure 5b. The quantitative analysis of the spectral image correlates
well to the expected Mn0.48Zn0.52O stoichiometry
and is consistent across the film thickness.

Optoelectronic Properties
It is important to evaluate
the band gap of Mn1–xZnxO from the measured absorption edge, because
it helps define the efficiency of solar light absorption and therefore
the upper limit of the photoconversion efficiency. As previously mentioned,
a minimum of 1.23 eV per electron–hole pair generated is needed
to drive the water splitting reaction. However, to account for the
overpotential losses produced during the electron-transfer processes
at the semiconductor/liquid junctions, an average of 2.0 eV is usually
needed to drive the reaction.1 Therefore,
it is important for the band gap energy of Mn1–xZnxO to be around that
value to efficiently split water.

The optical absorption spectra
of the Mn1–xZnxO for different crystalline structures grown at 381 °C
are shown in Figure 6. Substitution of Zn in MnO shifts the absorption edge toward the
higher wavelength region, which indicates a decrease in the band gap
energy. As-grown pure ZnO and MnO exhibit an absorption edge at around
3.3 eV. As x in the Mn1–xZnxO alloy increases, the optical
band gap absorption edge of the alloys shows a redshift down to 2.1
eV for x = 0.5. The color intensity map of optical
absorption spectra versus Zn content in Mn1–xZnxO is shown in Figure 7 for several different synthesis
temperatures. These absorption maps are also compared in Figure 7 with the corresponding
XRD color intensity maps. We find that the abrupt change in the optical
absorption onset occur at the RS/(RS + WZ) phase boundary, consistent
with the appearance of the lower-band gap WZ phase. Furthermore, the
Zn composition at which this abrupt change occurs decreases as a function
of increasing synthesis temperature, which is consistent with the
phase boundary results (Figure 3).

The blue dashed lines are theory predictions for the absorption onsets.

It has been found that the introduction
of Mn2+ into
the ZnO lattice leads to the presence of mid-gap states.25 The mid-gap states may affect the measured absorption
spectra and also influence the determination of the band gap.38 However, in our case where Zn2+ is
introduced into the MnO lattice, there is no evidence of the contribution
of mid-gap states as the Zn content is increased in Mn1–xZnxO. This is consistent
with what has been found in a previous work on undoped Mn1–xZnxO.29 However, the optical results are not sufficient to evaluate
the presence of mid-gap states, and further studies using photoelectron
spectroscopy are needed.

Most oxides photoanodes for photoelectrocatalytic
water splitting
in their intrinsic state suffer from poor electronic transport and
therefore require doping with electric charge carriers. In this case,
solar absorber materials should be n-type (electron carrier)-doped,
and the minority (hole) carriers should have a long lifetime and high
mobility. Therefore, we have explored the use of Ga as an extrinsic
donor dopant for our Mn1–xZnxO system. Although it was reported that Ga will
not contribute to the carrier or enhance the conductivity of rock
salt Mn1–xZnxO alloys,30 we have explored
the use of extrinsic n-type doping by Ga because it is known as an
efficient dopant in ZnO and wurtzite Zn1–xMgxO alloys.39 In addition, our previous band structure calculations predicted
a shallow Ga donor state with sufficiently low ionization energy to
generate free electrons at room temperature.33

As discussed in our previous publication,33 doping was achieved for the PLD growth by using a ZnO target
containing
4 cation % Ga. Thus, in the Mn1–x–yZnxGayO alloys, the Ga doping level varies with the Zn composition x (i.e., yGa = 0.04x). Thus, the conductivity (in S/cm) was normalized by the Ga content
per formula unit (i.e., per yGa). Note
that the Ga content is 0.02 at the composition x =
0.5. As x and y in Mn1–x–yZnxGayO increase, the conductivity increases
from unmeasurable in the RS single-phase region (x < 0.19), to 10 S/cm/Ga within the miscibility gap (0.19 < x < 0.45), to 100 S/cm/Ga observed in the WZ single-phase
region around x = 0.5, up to 104 S/cm/Ga
approaching the pure ZnO composition typical of Ga:ZnO.40 Subsequent Hall effect measurements have shown
that Mn1–x–yZnxGayO at x = 0.48 (yGa = 0.02) has an
electron concentration of n = 3 × 1019 cm–3 and mobility of μ = 0.4 cm2/(V·s), whereas at x = 0.75 (yGa = 0.03), n = 1 × 1020 cm–3 and μ = 3.5 cm2/(V·s),
consistent with conductivity values determined by a four-point probe.
Interestingly, the work functions of the films measured by Kelvin
probe microscopy were not greatly affected by the Zn content in the
range in Mn1–xZnxO and by the doping concentration of Ga, perhaps due to
the contribution of surface dipoles. The band gap of Mn1–xZnxO is also not expected
to be affected by dilute Ga substitution in a few percent range, where
rigid band approximation still holds and band filling effects are
negligible.

Discussion
After verifying the dopability
of Mn1–xZnxO, films without and with different
Ga atom percentages (atom %) were fabricated for the photoelectrochemical
experiments. In addition to the conductivity, the flat band potential
of a photoanode is an important parameter to determine, as it reflects
its ability to split water. Both conductivity and flat band potential
help elucidate the band structure of a semiconductor when interfaced
with a solution. Photoanodes drive the oxygen evolution reaction (OER)
at the electrode–electrolyte interface. When the photoanode
is illuminated with UV light, electrons and holes are generated, and
the photoanode surface shifts the Fermi level of the bulk (measured
potential) toward more cathodic potentials. The photogenerated minority
carrier holes remain on the photoanode and migrate toward the surface
to participate in the OER at the electrolyte interface by oxidizing
water or hydroxide to liberate O2. The majority carrier
electrons are directed from the photoanode to the Pt catalytic cathode,
where they reduce water or protons to form H2 gas.

Mott–Schottky
Analysis
In order to understand
the intrinsic electronic properties of Mn1–xZnxO in electrolyte solutions,
we performed electrochemical impedance measurements in the dark. The
carrier density and flat band potential (Vfb) at the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface can be quantified from
the measured CV curves by the Mott–Schottky equation41,42 1  wherein e0 is the electron charge, ε is the dielectric
constant
of Mn1–xZnxO, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, Nd is the donor density, V is
the electrode applied bias, Vfb is the
flat band potential, and kT/e0 is the temperature-dependent correction term. In this equation,
the area factor is included in the measured capacitance, as indicated
by the F/cm2 units in the corresponding plots (Figure 8). The high-frequency
dielectric constant ε of Mn1–xZnxO was theoretically (by independent
particle approximation)43 and experimentally
(by spectroscopic ellipsometry) determined to be 4 and 4.7, respectively.
We used here the experimental dielectric constant. The Mott–Schottky
plots collected from different compositions of Mn1–xZnxO alloys in PEC cells
are presented in Figure 8. An extrapolation of the linear region (X intercept)
in the Mott–Schottky plot (1/C2 versus applied potential V) was used to determine the value of the
flat band potential Vfb at 0.5 and 1 kHz.
The positive slope indicates that Mn1–xZnxO is an n-type material, consistent
with Hall effect measurements.

Figure 8 Mott–Schottky plots under dark
conditions for Mn1–xZnxO electrodes with
different compositions, measured at 1 kHz in 0.1 M aqueous K2SO4 solution (pH 10). The dashed lines represent the extrapolated
lines from the linear portion of the Mott–Schottky plots. The
inset is the magnification of the Mott–Schottky plots under
dark conditions for Ga0.02:Mn0.5Zn0.48O at 0.5 and 1 kHz. All films are 132 nm-thick unless mentioned (
data for the 272 nm-thick film is in green).

The results for both the flat band potential and the carrier
concentration
determined for different Mn1–xZnxO samples with x in the 0.4–0.6
range are presented in Figure 9. The carrier concentration of the undoped samples determined
from the Mott–Schottky plot increased slightly with the Zn
atomic concentration (Figure 9a). However, regardless of the Zn composition, the concentration
is below 1019 cm–3. The carrier density
of the samples increases with Ga doping with values varying between
1019 and 1021 cm–3 depending
on the Ga atomic concentration (Figure 9b). It is worth noting that these carrier density values
of are in agreement with the results obtained from Hall effect measurements
where the measured carrier densities for Ga-doped samples varied from
1019 and 1020 cm–3. The variation
of carrier density with Mn1–xZnxO thickness is very small, indicating that the
average concentration of donors does not vary much as the film becomes
thicker (Figure 9c).
However, if the total charge density does not vary, increasing the
thickness should lead to an increase in the total amount of charges
and therefore an increase in the flat band potential shift toward
more cathodic potentials.44−46

and carrier concentration

Photoelectrochemical Performance
The dependence of
the PEC performance of Mn1–xZnxO electrodes with 0.4 < x < 0.6 on the thickness is also studied, and the results are shown
in Figure 10. The
PEC performance of samples with thicknesses of 136 and 673 nm under
chopped light with both front illumination (the Mn1–xZnxO film facing the
light) and rear illumination is shown in Figure 10a. All films exhibit an anodic photocurrent,
indicating n-type behavior, and the photocurrent increases with the
applied positive potential. The front- and back-illuminated current–voltage
curves for the 136 nm sample strongly overlap each other, whereas
for the 673 nm sample, they differ as discussed in our previous publication.33 The inset of Figure 10a shows the generated photocurrent difference
(in percentage) between the front and back illumination (measured
at ∼1.25 V vs Ag/AgCl) for different photoelectrode thicknesses.
For a thickness equal or lower than ∼250 nm, a comparison between
the front and back illumination shows an almost identical photoresponse.
However, from a thickness equal to 200 nm or higher, this difference
becomes obvious and more pronounced with the thickness. A larger photoresponse
is observed when the material is illuminated from the front side.
Under front-side illumination, most charge carriers are generated
near the semiconductor/electrolyte interface where most of the light
is absorbed. This suggests that the performance of Mn1–xZnxO photoanodes for
water splitting is not limited by the diffusion length of the photogenerated
charge carriers for a film thickness equal or higher than 200 nm.
For other oxide materials, the hole transport is the rate-limiting
step for the PEC performance at much lower length scales.17,47,48

and (c) pH.

The effect of the Mn1–xZnxO
composition on the PEC performance was studied
by varying x from 0.3 to 0.7. It was found (Figure 10b) that with an
increase in x, the electrocatalytic activity first
increases and then decreases. The highest Mn1–xZnxO PEC activity was
obtained at x = 0.4, with the PEC activity dropping
and remaining relatively flat past x = 0.5. The highest
Mn1–xZnxO photoresponse, correlating with the lowest flat band potential
(−3 eV) at x ≈ 0.4 may be due to the
lowest doping at this composition and hence the highest spatial extent
of the built-in electric field at the liquid/semiconductor junction.
Another potential explanation is the induced internal electric field
close to the WZ/(RS + WZ) phase boundary that helps the electron–hole
separation and thus enhances the photocatalytic activity of the mixed
Mn1–xZnxO alloys.49

The effect of the pH
on the Mn1–xZnxO photocurrent was studied in different
electrolyte environments of 0.1 M K2CO3 with
pH 9.2, 0.5 M K2SO4 solution with pH 10, and
a buffer salt (sodium phosphate tribasic + K2SO4) with pH 12. In order to compare the behavior of the Mn1–xZnxO material in an environment
with different pH values, the applied potential was reported against
the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) according to the Nernst equation 2  where EAgCl is the experimental
potential measured against the Ag/AgCl
reference electrode and EAgCl0 is 0.198 mV (KCl saturated vs NHE) at 25 °C. The results shown
in Figure 10c suggest
that as the solution become more alkaline, the photocatalytic activities
of Mn1–xZnxO substantially improves. Therefore, changing the pH has the opposite
effect as varying the doping level of the semiconductor. A maximum
photocurrent of ∼340 μA cm–2 was measured
at pH = 12 for a 673 nm-thick film.

It is also worth noting
that a direct contact of the Mn1–xZnxO photoanode with
the K2SO4 electrolyte (pH = 10) for over 24
h under continuous UV illumination (simulated 1 sun illumination)
did not show evidence of photocorrosion or degradation and did not
substantially affect the measured current density values. Specifically,
the current densities were 0.117, 0.115, 0.119 mA/cm2 at
0, 7, and 25 h of measurement, which is within the ±0.005 mA/cm2 error of the technique. This observation is very encouraging
for Mn1–xZnxO as a viable candidate material for PEC applications. However,
it is worth mentioning that the Mn–O Pourbaix diagram is quite
complex with multiple species and a range of oxidation states. On
the other hand, the Zn–O Pourbaix diagram is rather simple,
with ZnO being stable at pH = 10 in a wide range of potentials. Thus,
one potential explanation for the Mn1–xZnxO stability is that a self-passivating
ZnO layer is formed on the surface of Mn1–xZnxO alloys.

Regardless of
the doping concentration, Mn1–xZnxO samples doped with
Ga did not exhibit any photoresponse. This observation suggests that
increased carrier concentration due to Ga doping may reduce the width
of the space charge layer, leading to less efficient separation of
the photogenerated charge carriers. The width of the space charge
layer (W) at the semiconductor/solution interface can also be derived
from the Mott–Schottky plot relationship and be expressed as 3  As one can see in Figure 10d, the width of
the space charge layer is reduced from 20 to 10 nm as Ga is introduced
and from 10 to 5 nm as the Ga doping concentration is increased, which
is consistent with the observed increase in carrier concentration.
So, even for the undoped samples, 1019 cm–3carrier density values obtained from the Mott–Schottky plots
may be already too high for forming a wide depletion region in Mn1–xZnxO
upon contact with the electrolyte, limiting the PEC performance. Therefore,
additional Ga doping of the Mn1–xZnxO material can only further decrease
the depletion width, which is detrimental to the performance of the
material.

The lack of PEC activity for the Ga-doped Mn1–xZnxO samples may also
result from several other effects. First, a very high doping concentration
may lead to the dopants forming recombination centers and result into
a rapid electron–hole recombination occurring before the electron
and/or hole species have time to carry out catalytic reduction/oxidation.50 Second, the specific surface area may decrease
with the increase in Ga concentration that is unfavorable to obtain
a high photocatalytic activity. Third, the band alignment of Ga-doped
samples may not straddle the water redox potentials to drive the OER.
To evaluate these different possibilities, additional measurements
such as XPS and UPS may help better understand the effect of Ga doping
on the PEC performance of Mn1–xZnxO.

Photoemission Spectroscopy
Figure 11 shows
ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy
(UPS) data for wurtzite Mn1–xZnxO (x ≈ 0.5) samples
undoped and doped with 0.4 and 4% Ga. The data in Figure 11b show that there is a change
in the O 2p orbital distribution in the He(I) spectra as a function
of doping. Figure 11c gives a magnified view of the onset of occupied states, which were
used to determine the ionization energy, as given in Table 1. Note that, here, we are investigating
the O 2p σ orbitals are at ∼4 eV and the O 2p π
orbitals are at ∼7 eV, rather than the electronic states of
the electrode surface defined by the valence features, since a better
way to understand these valence features is through a core-level analysis
and connection with theories. The He(II) spectra (Figure 11d) show the increased sensitivity
for the metal cation components of the valence band. This is evident
in the comparison between the He(I) and He(II) spectra where Zn 3d
orbital contributions emerge at ∼11 eV below the Fermi level.

and Fermi Level Relative to the Valence Band Minimum (ΔE) for Undoped and Doped Mn1–xZnxO (x ≈

Mn1–xZnxO (undoped)	4.5	5.3	0.8	
Mn1–xZnxO doped with 0.4% Ga	4.5	5.9	1.4	
Mn1–xZnxO doped with 4.0% Ga	4.3	5.8	1.5	
The UPS data presented in Figure 11 suggests that
increasing the doping in wurtzite Mn1–xZnxO
creates increased surface defects (mid-gap states) near the valence
band, which can be observed in the tail states. Given the self-compensation,
one can imagine similar tail states near the conduction band. The
listed ionization energies (Table 1) are the onsets of the tail states, as shown in Figure 11c (zoomed in the
region of the valence band from He(I)). The tail states also appear
to correlate with changes in the distributions of the oxygen orbitals
at 4–7 eV, which are most evident in the He(II) spectra (Figure 11d). This indicates
that Ga causes a change to the valence surface states and local binding
environment of the oxygen. In particular, the 4% Ga sample appears
to have the broadest distribution, which is consistent with doping.
The mid-gap states are the most easily oxidized states and expected
to be the first states to participate in the OER.51

In addition to light absorption (related to the band
gap), the
water oxidation efficiency also depends on two major factors: the
probability and rate of charge carrier separation and transfer and
the recombination rate of photogenerated electron–hole pairs.
The mid-gap states play a role in both cases. They can act as intermediates
for indirect charge transfer. In this case, the photogenerated carriers
trapped in the mid-gap states predominantly initiate the water splitting
process. However, the slow kinetics of the hole transfer to the water
oxidation reaction leads to a low rate of reaction, which is detrimental
to water splitting process.52−54 Instead of playing an intermediate
role and without a chemical involvement with the water splitting reaction,
the mid-gap states may act as trapping centers for photoexcited holes,
preventing them to participate in the water splitting reaction by
promoting the recombination of holes with electrons.55,56 Therefore, the mid-gap states contribute to lowering the rate of
water oxidation. Although there is no consensus in the literature
on which of these two processes is predominant, it is clear that both
of them impede the photocatalytic reaction.

In an attempt to
further understand the correlation between Ga
concentrations and poor electrochemical behavior, we constructed a
tentative band diagram of the doped Mn1–xZnxO materials based on photoemission
spectroscopy measurements. If we assume that the optical gap describes
the energetic position of the conduction band, then we can conclude
that increasing the Ga dopant increases the n-type character of the
sample, as shown in the band diagrams in Figure 12. Specifically, as the Ga concentration
increases, the Fermi level approaches the conduction band. However,
the validity of such an assumption is questionable for the Mn1–xZnxO
sample. In Figure 12a, the Fermi level at the surface is closer to the valence band (ΔE ≈ 0.8 eV), indicating a p-type material. This result
to first order appears as a direct contradiction to the n-type behavior
demonstrated by Hall effect and Mott–Schottky measurements.
This disparity could be explained by the fact that a bulk band gap
may be very different at the surface. In addition, in the n-type material
with defects, the Fermi level can be pinned at the surface at lower
energy than in the bulk, leading to upward band bending and apparent
lowering of the Fermi level measured by photoemission spectroscopy.
However, assuming the same (surface) band gap, with increasing Ga
concentration (Figure 12b,c), there is an increasing n-type surface character, consistent
with bulk measurements. In the future, it may be interesting to compare
this band diagram picture derived from photoemission measurements
(Figure 12) to a similar
picture that is constructed from photoelectrochemical measurements.

Conclusions
We
used a high-throughput screening methodology to study Mn1–xZnxO
materials in a wide composition range (with x varying
from 0 to 1) and identify a suitable composition for water splitting
applications. The films were grown by combinatorial pulsed laser deposition.
The observed band gap value Egap of 2.1
eV at the x ≈ 0.5 alloy composition is consistent
with theory predictions for the WZ structure of the Mn1–xZnxO alloy. The as-deposited
films are insulating, and doping with Ga improved the conductivity
of the films. The electrical conductivity for the 4% Ga-doped Mn1–x–yZnxGayO alloy with x = 0.48 is 1.9 S/cm, with an electron concentration of
3.1 × 1019 cm–3 and mobility of
0.8 cm2/(V·s), consistent with Mott–Schottky
measurements.

Mott–Schottky measurements were also used
to determine the
flat band potential and space charge width of all films and help evaluate
the carrier concentration of undoped samples. Water splitting experiments
have shown that as-deposited undoped films exhibit a photoresponse
under illumination, while doped films with Ga do not produce any photocurrent.
This could be explained by the small space charge region and the presence
of mid-gap surface states. The maximum photocurrent density of ∼340
μA cm–2 was measured at pH 12 for a 673 nm-thick
undoped film with 0.4 < x < 0.6.

Overall,
this study demonstrates that the Mn1–xZnxO alloys are promising
for photoelectrochemical water splitting but need further investigations
and optimization to be considered as an efficient material. For instance,
a careful control of the electron concentration is needed, with an
appropriate trade-off between good transport properties, the absence
of mid-gap states, and low recombination losses. Passivation of the
mid-gap states or enhancing the OER rate by coupling Mn1–xZnxO with an electrocatalyst
can also help enhance the photoresponse. Regardless of these future
challenges, Mn1–xZnxO appears to be a stable and viable candidate for
applications in PEC solar cells for hydrogen generation by water splitting.

Methods
Materials
Synthesis
Mn1–xZnxO alloy thin films were grown
on glass (Corning Eagle XG) substrates by pulsed laser deposition
(PLD). We employed a thin-film high-throughput combinatorial approach57−64 to deposit “libraries” with a spatial gradient in
both the composition and the substrate temperature. KrF excimer laser
(Spectra-Physics) operating at 248 nm with a pulse duration of 25
ns was used. The laser was operated at 40 Hz, and the beam was focused
through a 60 cm lens onto a commercial 1 inch MnO and ZnO rotating
targets (purity 99.99%) at a 45° angle, with a laser fluence
of 4 J/cm2 on the target surface. The target-substrate
distance was fixed to 7 cm. Prior to the depositions, the growth chamber
was evacuated to a base pressure of 10–9 Torr using
a turbomolecular pump then backfilled with an O2/Ar mixture.
In order to investigate the effects of different gas ratios and the
total pressure, the O2/Ar gas ratio was varied from 10–3 to 0.5 while keeping the total pressure (Ar + O2) at 5 mTorr, and then the total pressure was varied from
5 to 100 mTorr. The deposition was performed at a substrate temperature
ranging from 150 to 700 °C. A temperature gradient across the
substrate was obtained by introducing a spacer between the holder
and the substrate as reported elsewhere.65 Films with a lateral composition gradient were obtained by depositing
sequentially from MnO and ZnO targets with a specific geometry with
respect to the substrate.

Structural, Chemical, and Surface Characterizations
Each of the combinatorial samples was automatically mapped at 44
points (4 × 11 grid) to find the properties of the material as
a function of composition. X-ray fluorescence spectra were collected
using a Matrix Metrologies MaXXi 5 with W anode, 800 μm collimator,
and 300 s scan time. The resulting spectra were modeled using the
MTF-FP software to obtain both the chemical composition and the thickness
of the samples. The X-ray diffraction patterns of Cu Kα radiation
were collected using a Bruker D8 Discover. The diffraction peaks were
assigned based on the MnO and ZnO reference diffraction patterns obtained
from the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD). Kelvin probe
mapping with a 1 mm-diameter gold-coated probe was used to determine
the work function of Mn1–xZnxO combinatorial samples. The samples were placed
in ambient atmosphere and grounded during the work function measurements.
The Kelvin probe mapping system was calibrated both before and after
every mapping run using a highly oriented pyrolytic graphite standard
with the reference 4.6 eV work function.

Optical and Electrical
Characterizations
Optical spectra
were mapped in the 300–2000 nm range using a fiber optics-based
spectrometer with normally incident angle of light generated by deuterium
and tungsten/halogen light sources and collected using Si and InGaAs
detector arrays. The measured transmittance (T) and
reflectance (R) spectra were converted into the absorption
coefficient α using the relationship α = −ln[T/(1 – R)]/d, where d is the film thickness. The measurement of the electrical
conductivity was carried out by using the four-point probe method.
The current was applied by a Keithley 6221 DC and AC current source,
and the voltage was measured with a Keithley 2182 voltmeter. Spectroscopic
ellipsometry (J. A. Woollam M-2000S) was also used to both determine
the dielectric functions and verify the thickness accuracy of the
films.

Transmission Electron Microscopy
Specimens for transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) investigations were prepared site-specifically
in the combinatorial library using standard focused ion beam (FIB)
thinning and in situ lift-out techniques. Specifically, an FEI Co.
(Eindhoven, Netherlands) Nova 200 dual-column instrument operating
at 5 keV electron energies was used to first identify a composition
of Mn0.48Zn0.52O and then protect the sample
surfaces using electron beam-induced Pt deposition to a thickness
of approximately 50 nm. A Ga ion accelerating voltage of 30 kV was
used to further deposit a thicker layer of Pt and perform completion
of rough milling and in situ extraction to a Cu grid. Final thinning
was completed at 5 kV Ga ion accelerating voltages. Thinned specimens
were subsequently examined in an FEI Co. Talos 200 FX (S)TEM operating
at 200 keV. EDS spectral images (1000 × 1000 pixels) were acquired
using a nominally 1.5 nA STEM probe at count rates up to 125 kcps
using four windowless detectors. Spectral image analysis was completed
using the Esprit v.1.9 software (Bruker Inc., Berlin, Germany). Quantification
was completed using Cliff–Lorimer correction factors and fixing
the oxygen concentration to 50 atom %, assumed from the stoichiometries
of ZnO and MnO.

Photoelectron Spectroscopy
X-ray
and UV photoelectron
spectroscopy were performed on single-composition films with a Kratos
Axis Ultra X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with a monochromatic Al
Kα source (1486.6 eV) for XPS measurements and He(I) and He(II)
excitation sources (21.2 eV and 40.8 eV, respectively) for UPS measurements,
all at a base pressure of 10–9 Torr. Photoelectrons
were collected in a hemispherical analyzer and detected with a photodiode
array. A −10.00 V bias was applied to the sample to enhance
the collection of the lowest kinetic energy electrons during UPS analysis.
All UPS spectra were referenced to the Fermi level, EF, of a clean polycrystalline gold substrate.

Photoelectrochemical
(PEC) Experiments
Following all
previous characterizations, single-composition Mn1–xZnxO samples for PEC
characterizations were fabricated on the FTO substrate at the same
conditions as for combinatorial samples, except the substrate deposition
temperature that was fixed to 297 °C. For these samples, the
Zn composition in Mn1–xZnxO was varied with 0.40 < x < 0.60. The electrochemical measurements were performed using
a CH Instruments 660A electrochemical analyzer with a conventional
three-electrode system that consists of a platinum foil as a counter
electrode, Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) as a reference electrode, and Mn1–xZnxO
(grown at 297 °C) on FTO glass substrates as the working electrode.
The electrolytes used were 0.1 M K2CO3 with
pH 9.2, 0.5 M K2SO4 solution with pH 10, and
a buffer salt (sodium phosphate tribasic + K2SO4) with pH 12. A 250 W tungsten lamp solar simulator from Newport
Instruments was used as a light source (calibrated to global AM1.5
intensity with a reference cell). The samples were illuminated through
the back and front sides of Mn1–xZnxO photoelectrodes under chopped light.
An insulating epoxy (Loctite Hysol 1C) was used to cover the entire
Mn1–xZnxO sample except for the active area (between 0.27 and 0.42 cm2). Electrochemical impedance measurements were performed in
a 0.5 M K2SO4 carbonate buffer solution (pH
10) using an Impedance analyzer (Solartron SI 1260, Ametek, USA) and
the same three-electrode system. A sinusoidal (AC) potential with
and amplitude of 7 mV was superimposed on a bias voltage, and the
measurements were carried out through systematic variation of the
bias potential from 1.5 to 0.25 V versus Ag/AgCl at frequencies of
0.5 and 1 kHz. A scan rate of 5 mV/s was employed with a data acquisition
rate of 5 s per point. The ZView software version 3.1c (Scribner Associates
Inc., Southern Pines, NC, USA) was used for estimating the flat band
potential and carrier concentrations through fitting the experimental
data.
