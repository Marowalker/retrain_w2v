Using
quantum chemical calculations and exciton dynamics simulations,
we investigate the static second hyperpolarizability γ [the
third-order nonlinear optical (NLO) property at the molecular scale]
of slip-stacked pentacene dimer models in the correlated-triplet-pair
[1(TT)] state created from the singlet excited state in
the singlet fission (SF) process. It is found that the SF induces
significant (∼20 times at maximum) enhancement of γ/monomer
in the 1(TT) state as compared to that in the singlet ground
state. The origin of the remarkable enhancement of γ/monomer
is revealed by analyzing the γ density distribution and the
intermolecular orbital interaction. Furthermore, we clarify molecular
packings suitable for highly efficient SF and largely enhanced γ
values of a novel class of SF-induced NLO systems, which have promising
potential to surpass the conventional NLO systems.

1 Introduction
Third-order
nonlinear optical (NLO) phenomena have attracted a
great deal of attention in a variety of fields including physics,
chemistry, biology, and materials science due to their wide applications
including extremely large data storage,1,2 ultrafast optical
switching,3 ultrahigh sensitivity spectroscopy,4 and nanofabrication.5,6 Because
the materials with both the large third-order NLO property and ultrafast
response time are indispensable for realizing such applications, many
experimental and theoretical studies have been conducted to explore
the mechanism of NLO properties in molecular systems as well as to
construct design guidelines for highly active NLO materials. So far,
several structure–NLO property relationships and design guidelines
have been revealed; for example, introduction of donor/acceptor groups,4,7 extension of the π-conjugation length,8 and tuning the charge states9 have been
applied to the closed-shell molecular systems to enhance the second
hyperpolarizability γ, which is the third-order NLO property
at the molecular scale. In this regard, in recent years, open-shell
singlet systems have been explored from the viewpoint of highly active
NLO substances since the theoretical prediction of significant enhancement
of γ for open-shell singlet molecules with intermediate diradical
character y by Nakano et al.10−12 The diradical
character is a well-defined chemical index for the electronic state
of open-shell singlet systems and takes a value between 0 (closed-shell)
and 1 (pure open-shell).13,14 The theoretical prediction
of the y–γ correlation and the novel
design principle for highly efficient open-shell NLO systems have
been substantiated by accurate ab initio molecular orbital and density
functional theory (DFT) calculations on model and realistic molecular
systems12,15−20 and experimental measurements including two-photon absorption (TPA)21,22 and third-harmonic generation23,24 for several synthesized
open-shell singlet molecules.

Furthermore, Nakano and co-workers
have clarified spin-multiplicity
dependences of γ in molecules with different diradical characters
in the singlet state, that is, the relationship between spin-multiplicity,
diradical character, and γ: the closed-shell or open-shell molecules
with weak diradical character exhibit the enhancement of γ with
the increasing spin-multiplicity, whereas the molecules with intermediate
and large diradical characters exhibit the reduction of γ with
the increasing spin-multiplicity.25 This
finding suggests the possibility of another novel class of open-shell
NLO materials using high spin states, which are far superior in magnitude
to the conventional closed-shell NLO systems and even open-shell singlet
NLO systems with intermediate diradical character.

However,
few realistic NLO systems utilizing high spin states have
been proposed because it is known to be difficult to convert a singlet
into a higher spin state due to small spin–orbit coupling in
organic molecules. To overcome this problem, we focus on the singlet
fission (SF) phenomenon, which is an ultrafast process creating two
triplet excitons from one singlet exciton26−31 through a spin-allowed process to a correlated-triplet-pair (singlet
overall) state. The SF is now studied intensively due to its possibility
to improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency in organic solar
cells.32 As the feasibility conditions
of SF systems, Michl and co-workers have proposed the energy level
matching conditions at the single molecular level: (i) 2E(T1) ∼ E(S1) or 2E(T1) < E(S1)
and (ii) 2E(T1) < E(T2), where S1, T1, and T2 indicate the lowest singlet and triplet excited states and the second
lowest triplet excited state, respectively.28,29 On the basis of these conditions, Minami and Nakano have constructed
a novel design guideline for SF molecules using diradical (y0) and tetraradical (y1) characters: the molecules with small diradical (∼0.1
< y0 < ∼0.5) and much smaller
tetraradical character (y1/y0 < ∼0.2) tend to satisfy these energy level
matching conditions.33

Thus, SF is
predicted to be a feasible way to efficiently and immediately
generate the triplet state as the high spin state enhancing the NLO
property. Moreover, from the viewpoint of “weak diradical character”,
we expect that SF molecules are good candidates for a novel class
of open-shell NLO systems, referred to as SF-induced-NLO systems,
by combining the SF and high-spin NLO guidelines mentioned above.
Such molecules have the possibility to exhibit NLO properties that
surpass those of open-shell singlet molecules with intermediate diradical
character. From this hypothesis, it is predicted that the SF systems
have the potential for the ultrafast NLO switching systems using the
drastic change in the NLO property through SF. Indeed, larger NLO
responses have been reported recently in the SF process of pentacene-derivative
crystals, though the NLO enhancement mechanism remains veiled.34,35

In this study, therefore, we investigate the effects of SF
on the
third-order NLO properties (γ) of slip-stacked pentacene dimer
models with various intermonomer configurations to clarify the guiding
principle for controlling the γ in the correlated-triplet-pair
[1(TT)] state created by SF. The obtained results will
contribute to pioneering a novel class of highly efficient NLO materials,
that is, SF-induced NLO materials.

2 Methodology
2.1 Pentacene Dimer Models
The geometry
of pentacene monomers was optimized by the spin-flip time-dependent
density functional theory (SF-TD-DFT) method with the Tamm–Dancoff
and noncolinear approximations using the 6-311G* basis set and BHHLYP
xc-functional.36−38 We construct slip-stacked dimer models using the
optimized monomer structure, where z and x axes indicate the longitudinal and lateral directions,
respectively, and the y axis represents the stacking
direction (the intermonomer distance is fixed to be 3.50 Å) (Figure 1). The center of
the red-colored molecule is located at the origin of the coordinate
axis.

Figure 1 Molecular packing of the slip-stacked pentacene dimer model. The
centers of the upper (blue) and lower (red) monomers are located at
(z, x) and (0.0, 0.0), respectively,
with the fixed intermonomer distance y = 3.50 Å.

2.2 Representation of the Electronic
Structure
of the 1(TT) State Using the Spin-Unrestricted DFT Calculation
In this study, the broken-symmetry (spin-unrestricted) DFT [BS-DFT
(UDFT)] calculations are employed to describe the electronic structure
of the 1(TT) state. We first calculate the triplet states
for constituent pentacene monomers using the UDFT method and prepare
the initial guess for the calculation of pentacene dimers, which is
constructed from up and down spin wave functions localized at each
monomer. Next, the electronic structure of the 1(TT) state
is obtained by the UDFT calculation with the prepared initial guess.
Note here that the 1(TT) state is expressed by the multiconfigurational
determinants, which implies that the spin-restricted TDDFT method
cannot describe the electronic state correctly. On the other hand, the spin-unrestricted single determinant wave
function such as UHF and UDFT is known to have the ability to expand
in the form of a limited configuration interaction,39,40 though including spin contamination parts. Indeed, the open-shell
singlet ground states for various polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
are found to be well described by UDFT methods,15,41−43 and for their NLO properties, we have already justified
the UDFT results, e.g., LC-UBLYP results, for the hyperpolarizabilities
by comparing with strongly correlated results such as UCCSD(T) results.18 In contrast, since the reliability of the UDFT 1(TT) solutions for energies and NLO properties has not been
elucidated well, we compare the total energies, excitation energies,
and γ values calculated by the UDFT and the restricted active
space with double spin-flip (RAS-2SF) methods, the latter of which
more correctly describes the 1(TT) state.44−48 As a result, the variations in the γ values and the excitation
energies for a geometric change at the UDFT level of approximation
are found to well reproduce those at the RAS-2SF level of approximation
(see Figure S4–S8 in the Supporting
Information). Therefore, we discuss those quantities in the 1(TT) state at the UDFT level of approximation in this study.

2.3 Calculation and Analysis Methods for Second
Hyperpolarizability
We employ the finite-field (FF) approach49 to evaluate the longitudinal component of the
static γ (γzzzz). The γzzzz value is calculated using the fourth-order
numerical differentiation formula of energy E with
respect to the longitudinal electric field Fz 1  where E(Fz) indicates the total energy in the
presence of Fz. Also,
we employ the LC-UBLYP(μ = 0.33 bohr–1)/6-311+G*
method50 for the FF approach. In the present
calculations, we choose Fz = 0.0005 au, which is found to achieve a numerical accuracy within
an error of ∼1% on the static γ value (see Section 5 in the Supporting Information). To
clarify the spatial contribution of electrons to γzzzz, we perform γ density analysis.51,52 The longitudinal γ density ρzzz(3)(r)
is defined as the third-order derivative of the electron density ρ(r) with respect to Fz 2  ρzzz(3)(r) is related to
the γzzzz value by the following
equation. 3  where rz represents the longitudinal component z of
the electron coordinate. Also, to clarify the origin of the enhancement
of γ based on the summation-over-state (SOS) expression of γ,
we examine the excitation energies (Eex) and the longitudinal transition moments (μz), which contribute to the γ values, using the TD-LC-UBLYP
(μ = 0.33 bohr–1)/6-311+G* method. The SOS
expression of γ for symmetric systems is given by 4  where E0n denotes the
excitation energy to the nth
excited state from the initial state 0 and μnm is the transition moment along the longitudinal (z) axis between the nth excited state and the mth excited state.53

2.4 SF Dynamics Simulation with the Quantum Master
Equation Approach
To investigate the time evolution of 1(TT) population [P(1(TT))] in
each dimer configuration, we conduct SF exciton dynamics simulations
with the second-order time-convolutionless (TCL) quantum master equation
(QME) approach.54−56 We consider the total Hamiltonian of the pentacene
dimer models given by H = Hex + Hph + Hex-ph, where Hex is the
exciton Hamiltonian; Hph and Hex-ph represent the phonon (vibration) and exciton–phonon
(vibronic) coupling Hamiltonian, respectively (see Section 1 in the Supporting Information). We assume only the
Holstein coupling, which is predicted to provide significant effects
on the SF dynamics.57−59 The second-order TCL QME is expressed by43 5  where , Am≡|m⟩⟨m|, and  represents the adiabatic
exciton state
(the eigenstate of Hex with the eigenenergy
of Eα) given by a linear combination
of diabatic exciton state {|m⟩} = {|S1S0⟩, |S0S1⟩,
|CA⟩, |AC⟩, |TT⟩}. The second term on the right-hand
side of eq 4 indicates
the relaxation of exciton density matrix ρex(t), which is characterized by the relaxation
rate γm(ω,t) expressed by (under Markov approximation)45 6  where Jm(ν) is the spectral
density of the Holstein vibrational
mode of the mth diabatic exciton state and n(ν, T) indicates
the Bose–Einstein distribution at the temperature T. Jm(ν) is approximated by an Ohmic function with a Lorentz–Drude
cutoff56 7  where λm is the reorganization energy and Ωm is the cutoff frequency in the mth diabatic exciton
state.

In this study, the diagonal and off-diagonal elements
of the exciton Hamiltonian Hex are calculated
at the LC-RBLYP/6-311G* level of approximation using the range-separating
parameter μ (0.20 bohr–1) determined by the
IP tuning method.60,61 The excitation energies of the
Frenkel exciton (FE) state and the 1(TT) state are approximated
using those at the monomer level: E(FE) ∼ E(S1) = 2260 meV and E(1(TT)) ∼ 2E(T1) = 1720 meV.
The charge-transfer (CT) state excitation energy E(CT) and the electronic coupling are estimated at each dimer configuration
(see Section 1 in the Supporting Information).
The vibronic coupling parameters are set to (λm, Ωm) = (λ, Ω)
= (50, 180) meV, which are known to be the typical carbon–carbon
stretching mode for acene molecules.58 The
time evolution of P(1(TT)) is obtained
by applying the six-order Runge–Kutta method to solving the
QME (eq 5) with the initial
state S1S0 at T = 300 K (where
S0 is the singlet ground state), and the P(1(TT)) at 1 ps is regarded as the 1(TT) yield
in this study.

2.5 Evaluation of Energy Differences
between Excited
States in the Singlet Fission Process
For evaluation of the
lifetime of the 1(TT) state, we examine the energy difference
between adiabatic FE and 1(TT) states (ΔE(FE – 1(TT)) = E(FE) – E(1(TT))) and that between 1(TT) and 5(TT) states (ΔE(Q – S) = E(5(TT)) – E(1(TT))), both of which are predicted to be related to the lifetime
of 1(TT). ΔE(FE – 1(TT)) is estimated from diagonalization of Hex, and ΔE(Q – S) is calculated
by the CAM-UB3LYP/6-311G* method,62 which
is found to well reproduce the tendency of ΔE(Q – S) calculated using the restricted active space with
double spin-flip (RAS-2SF) method (see Figure S6 in the Supporting Information).44 Moreover, using the CAM-UB3LYP/6-311G* method, we calculate the
multiple diradical character yi,52,63 which is defined as the occupation number
of the lowest unoccupied natural orbital (LUNO) + i (nLUNO+i), to evaluate
the triplet–triplet interaction in the 1(TT) state.
We employ y0 and y1 to characterize the tetraradical 1(TT) state,
together with the average diradical character yav, which is defined by the arithmetic average of yi.64 All of
the calculations, except for the RAS-SF calculations, were performed
by the Gaussian 09 program package.65 The
RAS-SF calculations were performed by the Q-Chem 4 program package.66

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Spin State Dependence of γ of Pentacene
Monomers
We discuss the spin-multiplicity dependence of the
calculated γ values of the monomer. It is found that the γ
value increases from γ(S0) = 1.39 × 105 au to γ(T1) = 5.71 × 105 au by
changing from the singlet to the triplet state. We compare the excitation
having the largest |μz| value from the singlet ground state (S0 →
S5 excitation) with that from the first triplet state (T1 → T4 excitation) (see Tables S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information). The enhancement
of γ in the T1 state is predicted to be caused by
a significant reduction in Eex with keeping
a large amplitude of |μz| for the
T1 → T4 excitation. This tendency is
found to accord with the high-spin open-shell NLO design guideline.25

3.2 Molecular Packing Dependences
of γ at
the 1(TT) State, 1(TT) Yield, and SF-Induced
NLO Efficiency
We examine γ at the 1(TT)
state and P(1(TT)) in each dimer configuration. Figure 2a,b shows the molecular
configuration (z, x) dependences
of γ per monomer at the 1(TT) state [γ(1(TT))/2 for a pentacene dimer] and P(1(TT)) at 1 ps. It is found that the maximum γ(1(TT))/2 is 29.2 × 105 au at (z, x) = (7.0, 1.5) Å (C), in which γ
is ∼5 times enhanced as compared to that in the T1 state and ∼20 times enhanced as compared to that in the S0 state, whereas P(1(TT)) is only
0.37 due to the slow 1(TT) creation rate. It is found that
both γ(1(TT))/2 and P(1(TT)) exhibit large values at (z, x) = (4.5, 1.5) Å (A): γ(1(TT))/2
= 14.0 × 105 au and P(1(TT)) = 0.89, whereas γ(1(TT))/2 is similar to that
in the T1 state and P(1(TT))
is negligibly small at (z, x) =
(5.5, 1.5) Å (B): γ(1(TT))/2 =
5.31 × 105 au and P(1(TT))
= 0.01. To perform a comprehensive evaluation of the relationship
between P(1(TT)) and γ, we define
SF-induced NLO efficiency (η): 8  where γ(1(TT)) is
scaled
with γmax (the γ value for C)
so that η takes a value between 0 and 1, which is realized for
γ(1(TT))/γmax = 1 and P(1(TT)) = 1. Therefore, the larger η value indicates
the favorable molecular packing with higher efficiencies of both SF
and NLO properties. Figure 2c shows the variation in η on the z–x plane, where the regions near z = 4.5 and 7.0 Å are found to give the distributions
with larger η values in the x-direction and
the maximum η value is 0.42 for A. We have found
that the dimer configurations with large γ value tend to undergo
efficient SF, though the regions giving the peaks of γ(1(TT)) and P(1(TT)) do not necessarily
coincide with that of the η.

γ per monomer [×105 au] at (a) 1(TT)
state and (b) double-triplet
yield P(1(TT)) (at 1 ps) and (c) SF-induced-NLO
efficiency η in the slip-stacked dimer models. The (z, x) positions for A [(z, x) = (4.5, 1.5) Å], B [(z, x) = (5.5, 1.5) Å],
and C [(z, x) = (7.0,
1.5) Å] are also shown by black circles (see the main text for
explanation).

3.3 Analysis
of γ at the 1(TT)
State Using γ Density and Excitation Properties
To
clarify the spatial contribution of electrons to the enhancement of
γ, we investigate the γ density distributions for the
dimer models A, B, and C (Figure 3). It is found that
the γ density distributions for A and C exhibit well-separated positive and negative densities with significant
amplitudes between the monomers, which largely enhance the γ
amplitudes due to the third-order field-induced intermolecular charge
transfer (CT), whereas that for B does not exhibit such
features, resulting in the smaller γ amplitude.

Figure 3 γzzzz density distributions in 1(TT) states of the
slip-stacked dimer models A, B, and C. The yellow and blue surfaces
represent the positive and negative γzzzz density distributions with ±1000 au, respectively.

We further examine the excitation energy Eex and the longitudinal transition moment μz of 1(TT1) → 1(TTn) excitations
for A, B, and C to clarify
the origin of the
enhancement of γ. Here, 1(TTn) represents the nth 1(TT) state,
where the lowest 1(TT1) is also referred to
as 1(TT) as mentioned above (see Tables S4–S6 in the Supporting Information). In general, it
is difficult to obtain quantitative γ values by the SOS models
in the realistic systems because it requires precise excitation energies
and transition moments over a large number of excited states. On the
other hand, a small number of low-lying excited states with moderate
transition moments from the 1(TT) state are expected at
least to primarily contribute to the increase in γ based on
the SOS formula eq 4.
First, we discuss the characteristics of 1(TT8) (for C) and 1(TT9) (for A and B) states with the first largest transition
moment amplitudes from 1(TT). The primary excited configurations
in these excitations are found to be the same as those in the T1 → T4 excitation in the pentacene monomer
(see Sections 3, 5, and 6 in the Supporting
Information). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) –2
→ lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and HOMO →
LUMO+2 excitations in the 1(TT) state are found to correspond
to the HOMO–1 → HOMO and LUMO → LUMO+1 excitations
in the T1 state, respectively (see, for example, Figure S10 for A in the Supporting
Information). As shown in Table 1, these excited states have similar Eex and |μz| values at A, B, and C molecular configurations.
This result indicates that 1(TT8) and 1(TT9) states give similar contributions to the γ
values for A, B, and C.

Table 1 γ per Monomer (γ/2) and
Excitation Energies Eex of the Transition
with the First Largest Transition Moment Amplitudes |μz| for A, B, and C
 	γ/2 [×105 au]	excitation	Eex [eV]	|μz| [D]	
A	14.0	1(TT1) → 1(TT9)	2.50	12.3	
B	5.31	1(TT1) → 1(TT9)	2.47	12.9	
C	29.2	1(TT1) → 1(TT8)	2.47	14.1	
Next,
we discuss 1(TT1) → 1(TT3) (for A and B) and 1(TT1) → 1(TT4) (for C) excitations with the second largest |μz| values. Although these excited states are found
to be dominated by the HOMO → LUMO transition, the |μz| values are shown to be significantly different
from each other (Table 2). To clarify the origin of this difference, we investigate the transition
density (ρhl) distribution between
the α-HOMO and α-LUMO in the 1(TT) state (Figure 4). As seen from the
ρhl distribution, the HOMO →
LUMO transitions for A and C correspond
to the intermolecular CT with large transition density amplitudes,
which lead to the large |μz| for A and C. Moreover, this intermolecular CT transition
is predicted to be the excitation from the 1(TT) state
to the CT state because the primary distributions of α-HOMO
and α-LUMO have the distribution of the LUMO and HOMO in the
S0 state on the upper and lower monomers, respectively
(Figures S10 and S12). In contrast, the
HOMO → LUMO transition for B is found to have
a small amplitude of |μz| because
the transition density is relatively localized to a small spatial
region with small amplitudes, and the relative phase difference of
the ρhl in the monomers causes some
cancellations in the contributions to μz. As seen from the summation-over-state expression of γ
in the perturbation theory, these larger amplitudes of the intermolecular
transition moment for A and C than for B are predicted to contribute to more enhancement of γ
for A and C than for B.53 Therefore, the relative γ values for the
dimers on the (z, x) plane are predicted
to be determined by not the excitation with the first largest |μz| value but that with the second largest
|μz| value, which corresponds to
the HOMO → LUMO transition with a smaller orbital energy gap.

C	29.2	1(TT1) → 1(TT4)	1.34	3.70	156	
Here, we consider the electronic
couplings Vhl and Vlh, which are defined as Vij = ⟨i|F|j⟩(F: the Fock operator) and are included
in the off-diagonal elements in Hex, because
the degree of the intermolecular HOMO–LUMO overlap is related
to the relative values of Vhl and Vlh. Vlh indicates the electronic
coupling between the LUMO of the upper monomer (lA) and the HOMO of the lower monomer (hB), that is, between CT and 1(TT) states in
the SF process. Therefore, as seen in Figure S1b,c in the Supporting Information, Vhl and Vlh strongly
depend on the molecular configurations because the electronic coupling
is originated from the orbital overlap at a pair of neighboring chromophores.
Since Vlh is approximately
regarded as the transfer integral between the lA and hB for the dimer models,
we predict that if the |Vlh| is large, the distributions of the HOMO and LUMO in 1(TT) state extend over the neighboring monomer by including
both components lA and hB. It is found that |Vlh| exhibits large values for A and C (Table 2) because
of the large in-phase or out-of-phase overlap between the lA and hB. Therefore,
it is found that the α-HOMO and α-LUMO, which have primary
distributions on the upper (lA) and lower
(hB) monomers, respectively, also have
slight distributions on the lower (hB)
and upper (lA) monomers, respectively,
for A and C (see Figure 5), resulting in the large positive and negative ρhl densities well-separated
on the upper (lower) and lower (upper) monomers for A and C (see Figure 4). In contrast, |Vlh| shows a smaller value for B since the contributions
of the in-phase or out-of-phase overlap between the lA and hB are found to be almost
canceled with each other. This small |Vlh| value is predicted to cause the slightly extended
α-HOMO and α-LUMO distributions on the lower and upper
monomers, respectively, in the 1(TT) state for B (Figure 5), resulting
in the ρhl limited to a small spatial
region (Figure 4).
For β-HOMO and β-LUMO, the same discussion can be made
by replacing the upper and lower monomers.

Figure 5 Spatial distribution
of the α-HOMO and α-LUMO for A, B, and C. The white and blue
surfaces represent the positive and negative phases of the MOs with
a contour value of ±0.005 au, respectively. The orange circles
indicate the HOMO and LUMO distribution region extended to the neighboring
monomer.

From these results, we can see
that the molecular configuration
dependence of |Vlh| values
correlates with that of the ρhl distribution
patterns. In brief, we found the relationship between ρhl and |Vlh|, that is, the ρhl distribution
exhibits the character of the intermolecular CT transition from 1(TT) to CT states on the dimer configurations with the large
amplitude of the electronic coupling Vlh between CT and 1(TT) states in the SF
exciton Hamiltonian. Now, we predict that the large |Vlh| region well corresponds to the large
γ region since the ρhl distribution
with significant amplitudes over the dimer and well-separated positive
and negative distributions between the monomers cause the enhancement
of the HOMO → LUMO transition moment amplitude. To confirm
this prediction, we compare the two-dimensional maps [(z, x)–dependences] of γ and |Vlh| (Figures 2a and 6). It is found
that the molecular configurations with the relatively large |Vhl| values tend to exhibit
the large γ values, though the peaks of the Vlh map do not necessarily coincide with
those of the γ map. Consequently, the magnitudes of the SF electronic
coupling Vhl and Vlh between CT and 1(TT) states are found to be an effective index determining the relative
amplitude of γ in the 1(TT) state.

Figure 6 Molecular configuration
dependences of |Vlh|
[meV] in the slip-stacked dimer models.

Indeed, we evaluate the γ in the 1(TT) state for
two realistic SF dimer models (1 and 2 in Figure S15a in the Supporting Information) in
a pentacene crystal. The dimer model 2 having the large
displacement along the longitudinal (z) axis exhibits
a larger γ value (9.33 × 105 au) than 1 (5.22 × 105 au) due to the third-order intermolecular
CT (see Figure S16a in the Supporting Information).
Namely, such monomer configuration control for enhancing γ is
found to work well not only in the artificial slip-stacked dimer model
but also in the realistic pentacene crystal with a herringbone packing.
Moreover, as a possible approach to achieving the molecular configuration
with large γ value and 1(TT) yield, we could consider
a chemical modification such as an introduction of appropriate substituent
groups to zigzag edges of pentacene. 6,13-Bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl)
pentacene (TIPS-pentacene) is known to undergo the SF and slip-stacked
dimer configuration with large displacement along the longitudinal
axis (see Figure S15b in the Supporting
Information). The γ value in the 1(TT) state of the
TIPS-pentacene dimer model is found to be larger (γ = 25.3 ×
105 au) than those of the herringbone pentacene dimer models
(e.g., γ = 9.33 × 105 au for the dimer model 2). Therefore, among realistic pentacene frameworks, we expect
that the TIPS-pentacene is a good candidate for highly efficient SF-induced
NLO materials. We discuss the aggregation effect in molecular aggregates
on γ, though it is not the main purpose of this study. The important
factor in the enhancement of γ in the 1(TT) state
is whether the HOMO and LUMO are delocalized over the neighboring
monomer. As we mentioned above, the large electronic coupling leads
to the delocalization of the HOMO and LUMO in the 1(TT)
state. In molecular aggregates with large electronic couplings between
monomers, the HOMO and LUMO distributions are predicted to be more
delocalized than in the dimer models. Since the open-shell singlet
multiradicaloids with intermediate open-shell characters are predicted
to significantly enhance the γ values along the intermolecular
interaction pathway,19,64,67 the γ values are expected to increase more in larger-size
molecular aggregates, though the size and structural dependences of
such effects should be clarified in detail.

Differences between Frenkel Exciton
and 1(TT) States and between 1(TT) and 5(TT) States
Furthermore, from the viewpoint of realizing
the control of the NLO property in the 1(TT) state created
by SF, we investigate the lifetime of the 1(TT) state.
If the lifetime is short, it is difficult to utilize the remarkably
large γ in the 1(TT) state since the 1(TT) state is predicted to rapidly dissociate into two isolated triplet
(2 × T1) states via the 5(TT) state or
to recreate the FE state by triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA)
(Figure 7a). Therefore,
large ΔE(FE – 1(TT)) (= E(FE) – E(1(TT))) and
ΔE(Q – S) (= E(5(TT)) – E(1(TT))) values
are expected to be one of the conditions for utilizing the 1(TT) state. We calculate ΔE(FE – 1(TT)) and ΔE(Q – S) at the molecular
configurations with fixed z = 7.0 Å as a function
of displacement x, where a γ peak is included. Figure 7b,c shows the variations
in ΔE(FE – 1(TT)) and ΔE(Q – S) as a function of x. It
is found that the dissociation process more easily proceeds than the
TTA process because ΔE(Q – S) is shown
to be much smaller (more than 1 order) than ΔE(FE – 1(TT)). Interestingly, ΔE(Q – S) shows the peak for C, where the γ
is significantly enhanced, that is, the 1(TT) state for C has a longer lifetime than those in the other intermonomer
configurations. We examine the reason why ΔE(Q – S) has the peak for C using the average
diradical character yav (= (y0 + y1)/2) for 1(TT). The stabilization of the 1(TT) state by the intermolecular
bonding interaction between the two triplet excitons is predicted
to be described by the yav value since
the large (small) yav value indicates
the weak (strong) covalent-like intermolecular interaction. Figure 7c shows the molecular
packing dependences of ΔE(Q – S) and yav. It is found that the increase and decrease
in ΔE(Q – S) correspond to the decrease
and increase in yav value, respectively.

diagram for the SF process, (b) molecular packing
dependences of ΔE(FE – 1(TT))
[meV] and ΔE(Q – S) [meV], and (c) averaged
diradical character yav for 1(TT).

We examine the x-dependence of yav using natural orbitals
(NOs) corresponding to y0 and y1 for C and (z, x) = (7.0, 0.0)
Å (D). For D, the highest occupied
natural orbital (HONO) and LUNO in the 1(TT) state are
found to be made by the out-of-phase and in-phase mixings of the HOMO
in the monomer S0 state (corresponding to singly occupied
natural orbital (SONO1) in the T1 state), respectively
(Figure 8a,b). Similarly,
the HONO–1 and LUNO+1 are found to be made by the out-of-phase
and in-phase mixings of the LUMO in the monomer S0 state
(corresponding to SONO2 in the T1 state), respectively.
This implies that there exist only the interactions between the HOMO–HOMO
and LUMO–LUMO in D. On the other hand, for C, the HONO and LUNO in the 1(TT) state exhibit
primary distributions at the upper (lower) zigzag edge in the upper
(lower) monomer, whereas the HONO–1 and LUNO+1 do primary distributions
at the lower (upper) zigzag edge in the upper (lower) monomer (Figure 8d). Here, we consider
the linear combinations of the SONO1 and SONO2 in the T1 state, which are defined as the SONO1 – SONO2 and SONO1 +
SONO2 (Figure 8c).
In Figure 8c,d, it
is found that the HONO–1 – LUNO+1 is described by the
linear combinations of the SONO1 and SONO2 in the T1 state,
that is, the HOMO and LUMO in the S0 state. This result
indicates that there exist not only the HOMO–HOMO and LUMO–LUMO
intermolecular interactions but also the HOMO–LUMO intermolecular
interaction in C. Thus, it is found that the intermolecular
interactions for C are stronger than those for D because the HOMO–LUMO intermolecular interaction
does not exist in D.

SONO2 in the T1 state; (b) HONO–1 – LUNO+1
corresponding to y0 and y1 in the 1(TT) state for D; (c)
SONO1 ± SONO2, which
are combined linearly with SONO1 and SONO2 in the T1 state;
and (d) HONO–1 – LUNO+1 corresponding to y0 and y1 in the 1(TT) state for C. White and red surfaces represent the
positive and negative phases of the NOs with the contour value of
±0.015 au, respectively.

The strong intermolecular interaction in C is predicted
to cause the stabilization of the 1(TT) state, resulting
in the smaller yav and the larger ΔE(Q – S) values than D. For larger x values (>1.5 Å) in Figure 7c, the yav and
ΔE(Q – S) exhibit increase and decrease
behaviors, respectively, because of the decreasing intermolecular
structural overlap. Judging from the fact that the HOMO–LUMO
intermolecular interaction relates to the electronic coupling Vhl and Vlh, we can expect that the intermonomer configurations
with large |Vhl| values
tend to have large ΔE(Q – S) values.
From these results, the relationship among the SF efficiency, third-order
NLO property, and the lifetime of the 1(TT) state is found
to exhibit the positive correlation in the molecular packing dependence,
that is, the molecular packing suitable for efficient SF also tends
to exhibit a large enhancement of the third-order NLO property in
the 1(TT) state with a longer lifetime. Note here that
the efficient SF implies a rapid creation of 1(TT) in this
study, not implying the consecutive rapid dissociation into two isolated
triplet excitons, though the SF process usually includes the dissociation
process of 1(TT) to T + T.28,29 Recently,
the separation and the lifetime of the 1(TT) state have
been experimentally measured for several SF systems. For example,
it has been reported that the separation of the 1(TT) state
in rubrene single crystals occurs on the picosecond time scale.68 Moreover, it has been found that quinoidal bithiophene
(QOT2) has the long-lived 1(TT) state, where the lifetime
of the 1(TT) state and ΔE(Q –
S) are microsecond time scale and 230 meV, respectively.69,70 From the viewpoint of using the 1(TT) state, we expect
that SF systems having the long-lived 1(TT) state such
as QOT2 can be good candidates for SF-induced NLO systems.

4 Conclusions
In this study, we have explored the effective
molecular packing
in the pentacene slip-stacked dimer models suitable for high SF efficiency
[rapid creation of 1(TT)] and the large third-order NLO
property in the 1(TT) state. For the intermonomer packing
with a large |Vhl| value,
which relates to the 1(TT) creation rate, a remarkable
increase in the γ is predicted, the feature of which is found
to be caused by the HOMO–LUMO transition in the 1(TT) state with a small excitation energy and a large intermonomer
transition moment amplitude. The γ value is found to be maximized
in (z, x) = (7.0, 1.5) Å and
exhibits a significantly large enhancement of γ/2 by a factor
of ∼20 (γ/2 = 29.2 × 105 au) as compared
to that in the S0 state. The obtained γ value is
found to be comparable to that in dicyclopenta[b;g]naphthaleno [1,2,3-cd;6,7,8-c′d′]diphenalene
(NDPL) (γ = 22.8 × 105 au),71 which is known to exhibit the largest possible TPA cross
section (one of typical third-order NLO properties) in pure hydrocarbon
systems of similar size.22 In such molecular
packing, the 1(TT) state tends to be immediately created
and to have a long lifetime, which indicates the possibility of utilizing
the highly efficient third-order NLO property in the 1(TT)
state. The present results are expected to be applied to a variety
of SF systems as a new design principle “SF-induced NLO”
for the enhancement and the control of the NLO properties, which are
predicted to be superior to those of conventional NLO systems. The
investigations of a variety of SF-induced NLO systems are now in progress
in our laboratory.
