This
study examines the unique morphology and properties of enhanced
poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA) monoliths having a bacterial cellulose
(BC) framework. Open-porous BC/PLLA monoliths were successfully prepared
using thermally induced phase separation (TIPS) and a freeze-drying
technique. The BC/PLLA monoliths exhibited a unique ivy-like structure
composed of leaf-like PLLA units and a BC fiber network. We demonstrated
for the first time that the interpenetrating BC fiber gives PLLA monoliths
four times higher compressive strength than the pristine PLLA. Scanning
electron microscopy observation and the N2 adsorption test
revealed that the size of PLLA units and the surface area of the monoliths
can be manipulated by varying the starting PLLA concentration during
the TIPS process. Moreover, the hydrophilicity of the PLLA monoliths
was easily controlled by incorporating BC; the neat PLLA monoliths
showed a high static water contact angle of as high as 128.8 ±
1.1°, whereas the BC/PLLA monoliths exhibited a much lower contact
angle (102.1 ± 1.7°) and greater absorbability to water.

Introduction
Poly(lactic acid) (PLA)
is a representative bioplastic with biodegradability,
biocompatibility, and nontoxicity, and can be produced from renewable
resources such as sugarcane. In addition to these fascinating properties,
PLA also has a higher transparency, unique mechanical properties,
and a versatile processing ability when compared to other biomass-derived
plastics. As a result, PLA has attracted considerable attention as
a biomaterial and as an alternative to petroleum-based polymers.1 Because of the recent industrialization of PLA
and its environmental adaptability, it has been applied to various
fields such as biomedicine, food packaging, commodities, and even
3D printing technology based on the increasing awareness of sustainable
societies.2

Recently, PLA monoliths
have been in the spotlight as a functional
material because of their high surface area and interpenetrating 3D
network. Owing to these unique characteristics, monolithic PLA has
been utilized as scaffolds for human cells, artificial bones, supports
for controlled release of drugs, and biodegradable filters.3−7 However, the practical use of PLA monoliths remains challenging
because their mechanical properties considerably deteriorate because
of the development of porous structures.8 Furthermore, hydrophobic surfaces of monoliths that are notably
high limit their applications, particularly in scaffolds and filters
because the loss of hydrophilicity produces insufficient medium osmosis
and a high back pressure during the flow.6 To overcome these drawbacks, numerous studies have been conducted
to utilize the modifier agents.7−9 However, no studies so far have
achieved sufficient properties or were able to control the pore size.
In particular, the precise control of the pore size is critical to
meeting requirements for usage because the morphology of monoliths
affects several factors such as cell adhesion, biodegradability, and
filtration ability.4 Thus, producing hydrophilic
PLA monoliths that have high mechanical properties and have the ability
to control the morphology is desirable.

Bacterial cellulose
(BC) gel can be a promising means to address
the physical properties and hydrophobicity of PLA monoliths. BC gel
is an extracellular byproduct of acetic acid bacteria, which exhibits
biodegradability and biocompatibility similar to those of PLA.10,11 Compared to general plant-based cellulose, BC gel has considerable
superiority in terms of 3D network, porosity, purity, crystallinity,
and water content, making it an attractive biomaterial in numerous
fields.11−13 In addition, a layered structure is formed in a BC
gel during cultivation, which is the cause of its unique mechanical
anisotropy.14,15 Because it exhibits a high Young’s
modulus, tensile, and compressive strength, the BC gel has also been
used to reinforce polymers.16,17 Therefore, the use
of the BC gel would change PLA monoliths to a next-generation porous
material, storing its environmental adaptability.

Few studies
have been conducted that examine PLA monoliths that
use a single crystal of BC (i.e., BC nano-whisker; BCNW)18 instead of the BC gel. In contrast to a BC gel
with a 3D structure, BCNW can be easily introduced into the PLA monoliths
through a variety of methods. For instance, Luo et al. reported that
poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA) monoliths with 5 wt % of BCNW
were successfully produced using a solvent casting method and showed
improved mechanical strength and hydrophilicity.18 However, mechanical properties showing an increase in tensile
strength, tensile modulus, and compressive strength were limited to
less than 64% from the neat PLLA monolith. Furthermore, in contrast
to BC gel, the addition of considerable BCNW generally causes self-aggregation,
which causes poor dispersion. Thus, the amount of BCNW can be manipulated
within a very narrow range to control physical properties and wettability.19 In addition, until now, no studies have been
conducted that achieved both the reinforcements previously mentioned
and the control of PLA porous morphology.

In this study, we
attempted to synthesize a monolithic composite
of PLLA and BC gel having good mechanical strength and hydrophilicity
using a simple phase separation technique while controlling the porous
morphology during the process. Moreover, we measured the fundamental
physical properties of the monoliths through a compressive test and
water contact angle examination. The mechanical anisotropy of the
BC/PLLA monoliths was also investigated, focusing on the directions
of BC layers.

Materials
PLLA was purchased from
NatureWorks LLC (Ingeo Biopolymer 4032D).
1,4-Dioxane and 2-butanone were obtained from Nacalai Tesque and were
used as received. BC gel was purchased as a Nata de coco from Thailand
and exchanged with sufficient amount of water before use.

Results and Discussion
BC/PLLA monoliths were prepared through the formation of a porous
structure of PLLA within the BC gel using a thermally induced phase
separation (TIPS) method. Utilizing TIPS has remarkable advantages
in terms of process flexibility, reproducibility, and controlling
the pore size when compared to the traditional nonsolvent-induced
phase separation (NIPS).20−22 For this study, the NIPS technique
could not be used because its fast phase separation after the addition
of nonsolvents halts the diffusion of nonsolvents in the BC gel, thereby
preventing PLLA from forming inside the gel. This suggests that TIPS
can be a limited means to producing a monolithic composite of PLLA
and BC gel, while maintaining the morphology of each. TIPS was performed
using 1,4-dioxane as a good solvent, water as a nonsolvent, and 2-butanone
as a mid-solvent (Scheme 1). This recipe for phase separation was based on the previous
investigation conducted by our research group.23 Briefly, this ternary system that includes a mid-solvent
easily enables PLLA morphology to be manipulated simply by changing
the ratio of solvents or the concentration of PLLA.

Scheme 1 Fabrication Process
of BC/PLLA Monoliths in This Study
First, the BC gel (water content = 99.5%) was immersed
in 1,4-dioxane/2-butanone
mixture at room temperature, while fixing the solvent ratio (1,4-dioxane/2-butanone/water)
to 20/70/10 (v/v %), under stirring overnight. PLLA was added to the
solution in the range of 50–100 mg/mL (Table 1) and heated at 75 °C for 20 h to produce
a BC gel saturated with the PLLA solution. Then, the BC gel that includes
the PLLA solution was immediately cooled to 0 °C for 1 h using
an ice bath to induce phase separation of the PLLA. The resultant
BC/PLLA wet gel was exchanged with sufficient amount of water and
was freeze-dried under 10 Pa for 2 d to yield BC/PLLA dry monoliths.
Pristine PLLA monoliths listed in Table 1 were also prepared using this same method,
with fixed (1,4-dioxane/2-butanone/water) 20/70/10 (v/v %) as the
solvent. Each sample was named BC/PLLAx or PLLAx, where x denotes the starting concentration
of PLLA used in the process (Table 1).

was calculated from the weight of the starting BC gel assuming the
water content of the gel = 99.5 wt %.

c NA: The specimens were collapsed
during the measurements so that the data were not available.

BC/PLLA monoliths were successfully
prepared without undergoing
shrinkage through freeze-drying. The overall BC content in the monolith
was changed from 8.6 to 4.4 wt % as a result of the starting PLLA
concentration (Table 1). The PLLA concentration of less than 50 or more than 125 mg/mL
resulted in a polymer precipitation without gelation or a clouded
heterogeneous solution. In addition, PLLA50 and PLLA75 were sufficiently
fragile to collapse before the formation or measurements of the sample.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation demonstrated that
the open-porous BC/PLLA structure was formed without discontinuous
pores (Figure 1), thus
storing the original anisotropy of BC (Figure S1). It is noteworthy that the BC/PLLA monoliths exhibited
an ivy-like double network (Figure 2) composed of the BC fiber (Figure 1a) and leaf-like PLLA units (Figure 1b,c) . Furthermore, a single
PLLA unit was also formed and attached to the BC framework, which
is clearly seen in BC/PLLA50 (Figure 1d). This suggests that crystallization of PLLA occurred
in the BC gel through solid–liquid phase separation during
the TIPS process and is the main mechanism of the formation. In general,
TIPS employs two mechanisms until demixing is completed: liquid–liquid
(L–L) and solid–liquid (S–L) phase separation.21,22 L–L phase separation induces demixing between the polymer-rich
and the lean phases through spinodal decomposition, which results
in a continuous polymer morphology. By contrast, S–L phase
separation is driven by crystallization of polymers, which generates
a sea-island structure with polymer crystals. Considering the formation
of a leaf-like PLLA 3D network and the existence of an independent
PLLA unit, the crystallization of PLLA (S–L phase separation)
can occur during the polymer-rich phase of initial L–L phase
separation induced by quenching. This tendency can be found in studies
on PLLA monoliths (e.g., Rezabeigi et al. also successfully fabricated
noncontinuous porous PLLA through S–L phase separation through
NIPS).24,25 The leaf-like PLLA unit discovered in our
study may be explained by the single PLLA crystal formed at the beginning
of the S–L phase separation. It is known that the PLLA monoliths
consisting of leaf- or lozenge-like crystals can be prepared through
both the TIPS and the NIPS under limited conditions.23−25 Per the previous discussion, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)
measurements (Figure S2) were conducted
to calculate the crystallinity (Xc) of
PLLA, assuming a theoretical heat of fusion of 93.1 J/g.26 The Xc of BC/PLLA100
(66.4%, PLLA section) and PLLA100 (68.3%) monoliths were much higher
than that of the starting PLLA pellet (38.9%), which clearly suggests
that the crystallization of PLLA was promoted by S–L phase
separation. In particular, the Xc of BC/PLLA100
was significantly high despite the presence of the BC fiber in the
PLLA framework. This was probably because the BC fiber acted as a
nucleating agent for PLLA during phase separation.27 For this reason, the crystallization of PLLA could start
at the surface of the BC fiber, resulting in an ivy-like morphology
in which leaf-like PLLA crystals are entangled within the BC network.
It is interesting to note that the size of leaf units was minimized
when the content of PLLA was increased (see Figure 1). This was because of the higher viscosity
induced by both dense concentration and fast crystallization of PLLA,
which limited the initial L–L phase separation and induced
minimized crystal morphology.4 This suggests
that the pore size and surface morphology can be manipulated by the
starting PLLA concentration. To evaluate how easily the morphology
can be controlled, a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller N2 adsorption test was performed (Figure S3, Table S1), which revealed that the specific
surface area of the BC/PLLA monolith decreased with increasing amounts
of PLLA. This was possibly due to the relatively flat surface of the
PLLA unit (Table S1) and the change in
the PLLA surface structure caused by phase separation in the presence
of BC. Therefore, we demonstrated that the ivy-like BC/PLLA monoliths
with highly porous morphology and good controllability of pore size
could be effectively tailored using a simple TIPS technique.

Next, a compressive test was performed
to examine the change in
the mechanical strength of BC/PLLA monoliths (Figure 3, Table S1). The
sample was compressed perpendicularly or parallelly to the BC layers
to measure the mechanical anisotropy of the monoliths. It was surprising
that the BC/PLLA100 exhibited four times higher compressive stress
than the PLLA100 at 70% strain (Figure 3A, Table S1) despite the
fact that a dried neat BC gel has critical fragility.28,29 Moreover, BC/PLLA showed considerable improvement in terms of brittleness,
whereas PLLA100 was cracked and collapsed under 30% strain during
compression (the test was continuously conducted after 30% strain
as a matter of convenience) (Figure 3B). This may be because the 3D BC network acted as
a reinforcement agent, like a steel frame, for the brittle PLLA monoliths.16 In addition, the mechanical anisotropy of BC/PLLA
was observed according to the direction of compression (Table S1). It was revealed that a higher stress
was required for the compression parallel to the BC layer than that
for the perpendicular. This phenomenon was reported previously, namely,
the mechanical strength of a BC gel changed dramatically because of
its anisotropic structure.14,15 In this study, the
difference between these orientations was limited to within a small
range probably because the PLLA unit was filled throughout the BC
structure. Thus, it was revealed that the interpenetration of the
BC fiber efficiently enhanced the brittle PLLA monoliths consisting
of leaf-like crystals.

Finally, the change in
wettability was investigated through a static
water angle experiment (Figure 4, Table S1). The BC/PLLA100 monolith
exhibited a notably lower contact angle (102.1 ± 1.7°) than
did the pristine PLLA (128.8 ± 1.1°) (Figure 4A). Furthermore, the BC/PLLA100 monolith
spontaneously absorbed water droplets, whereas PLLA100 retained the
drops on its surface (Figure 4B). Regarding BC/PLLA50 and BC/PLLA75, the hydrophilicity
dramatically improved, as water droplets were rapidly absorbed in
the monoliths (Table S1) and the contact
angle was not available. This fact suggests that incorporating hydrophilic
BC enables the PLLA monoliths to manipulate its wettability. In previous
studies, the hydrophilicity of PLLA monoliths was improved using BCNWs.
However, the water contact angle remained at 57° in the BCNW/PLLA
monolith.18 In our research, it was demonstrated
that a large BC structure can be introduced throughout the PLLA monoliths
using a TIPS technique. In addition, we found that the hydrophilicity
of PLLA monoliths could be easily controlled by the ratio of a BC
gel (4.4–8.6 wt %).

Conclusion
In this study, we developed a novel monolithic
composite composed
of PLLA and BC gel using a simple TIPS technology and elucidated the
changes in morphology, mechanical properties, and wettability. BC/PLLA
monoliths exhibited a unique ivy-like double network wherein a leaf-like
PLLA unit and the BC fiber co-existed. It was clearly observed that
this ivy-like structure contributed to the reinforcement of the PLLA
monoliths and exhibited four times higher compressive strength than
that of neat PLLA. Furthermore, it was revealed that the interpenetration
of a BC structure changes the hydrophobic PLLA monoliths to hydrophilic
materials and can thus considerably expand the use of PLLA monoliths.
Thus, we demonstrated for the first time that the hydrophilic PLLA
monoliths with both high mechanical properties and the ability to
control morphology can be prepared by incorporating BC gel and by
using a simple TIPS technique.
