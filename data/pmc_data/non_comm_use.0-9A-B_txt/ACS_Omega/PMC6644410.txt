DNA
origami nanostructures are regarded as powerful and versatile
vehicles for targeted drug delivery. So far, DNA origami-based drug
delivery strategies mostly use intercalation of the therapeutic molecules
between the base pairs of the DNA origami’s double helices
for drug loading. The binding of nonintercalating drugs to DNA origami
nanostructures, however, is less studied. Therefore, in this work,
we investigate the interaction of the drug methylene blue (MB) with
different DNA origami nanostructures under conditions that result
in minor groove binding. We observe a noticeable effect of DNA origami
superstructure on the binding affinity of MB. In particular, non-B
topologies as for instance found in designs using the square lattice
with 10.67 bp/turn may result in reduced binding affinity because
groove binding efficiency depends on groove dimensions. Also, mechanically
flexible DNA origami shapes that are prone to structural fluctuations
may exhibit reduced groove binding, even though they are based on
the honeycomb lattice with 10.5 bp/turn. This can be attributed to
the induction of transient over- and underwound DNA topologies by
thermal fluctuations. These issues should thus be considered when
designing DNA origami nanostructures for drug delivery applications
that employ groove-binding drugs.

Introduction
During the last three
decades, the field of structural DNA nanotechnology
has developed a variety of techniques to assemble DNA into increasingly
complex two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) nanostructures.1−3 Currently, DNA nanostructures and especially DNA origami4,5 are widely investigated with regard to their applicability in fields
as diverse as nanoelectronics,6−10 molecular sensing,11−14 and drug delivery.15−26 For the latter application, drug loading of the DNA origami delivery
systems has been achieved mostly via intercalation between the base
pairs of the DNA origami’s double helices.16−19,23,25,26 Intercalation
induces unwinding of the double helices and may therefore lead to
structural distortions of the DNA origami nanostructures.16,27 By employing DNA origami designs with deliberately underwound double
helices, however, intercalator loading of the DNA origami can be enhanced.16,28

The interaction of DNA origami with other chemical species
that
undergo nonintercalative binding to DNA is less studied. Opherden
et al. investigated Mg2+ and Eu3+ coordination
of two different DNA origami nanostructures, that is, 2D triangles
and 3D six-helix bundles (6HBs).29 By employing
a variety of spectroscopic techniques, a superstructure-specific geometry
of Eu3+-binding sites was revealed in the two DNA origami
designs that furthermore deviates from that of genomic double-stranded
DNA (dsDNA).

In this work, we investigate the binding of the
drug methylene
blue (MB) to different 2D and 3D DNA origami nanostructures under
conditions favoring minor groove binding and observe a strong dependence
on DNA origami superstructure. MB is a fluorescent azine dye that
is widely used as an optical and electrochemical probe molecule in
the study of DNA-based systems and reactions.30−33 In clinical practice, MB has
been used extensively as a therapeutic agent to treat numerous diseases,
including malaria and methemoglobinemia.34,35 More recently, MB has been rediscovered as a photosensitizer for
the photodynamic therapy of various viral, bacterial, and fungal infections,
as well as cancers.36−45 Consequently, also the delivery and controlled release of MB by
various carrier systems has received significant attention in recent
years.46−53

Results and Discussion
MB can interact with dsDNA via different
binding modes. At low
salt concentrations, intercalation into the G–C base pairs
is favored, whereas at the high salt concentrations typically
employed in DNA origami experiments, for example, 10 mM MgCl2 as used in the following experiments, a transition to nonintercalative
binding occurs.54−57 Irrespective of the binding mode, however, interaction of MB with
DNA is in general accompanied by a decrease in its absorption at 668
nm.57−59

In order to elucidate the nature of this nonintercalative
binding
mode, UV–vis absorbance spectra of MB with and without
genomic dsDNA from salmon testes were recorded at different ionic
strengths. This dsDNA has a GC content of 41% and is thus
comparable to the fully hybridized M13mp18-based DNA origami scaffold
with a GC content of 42%. As can be seen in the spectra presented
in Figure 1a,
the absorbance at 668 nm clearly decreases upon addition of dsDNA,
both in water and in 1× TAE (Tris base, acetic acid, and ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid) buffer supplemented with 10 mM MgCl2. In water, this
hypochromicity is accompanied by a significant red shift of the absorbance
peak that results in a crossing of both spectral signatures at a wavelength
of about 680 nm. In TAE/MgCl2 buffer, however, this shift
is absent, indicating the nonintercalative binding of MB, which is
in agreement with previous reports.58,59

Figure 1 (a) UV–vis
absorbance spectra of 20 μM MB with and
without genomic dsDNA from salmon testes in water and MgCl2-containing TAE buffer. DNA concentrations were 13 μM (water)
and 11 μM (TAE + 10 mM MgCl2) in phosphates. In order
to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio and detect even small bathochromic
shifts, the shown spectra have been averaged over 10 individual absorbance
measurements. Individual spectra can be found in the Supporting Information. (b) UV–vis spectra of the competition
between 20 μM MB and 500 μM spermidine (left) and netropsin
(right), respectively, in 1× TAE buffer supplemented with 10
mM MgCl2. The spectra of the spermidine-containing samples
exhibited a broad background which has been subtracted in the above
plot. The concentration of the genomic dsDNA was 308 μM in phosphates.

In order to identify the nonintercalative
binding mode of MB, competition
assays were performed, employing spermidine and netropsin. While spermidine
can bind to both the minor and major grooves,60,61 netropsin is a potent minor groove binder.62,63 Depending on the binding modes of MB and the competing groove binder,
addition of a large excess of these groove binders will result in
its displacement from the minor groove, the major groove, or both,
and thereby reverse the hypochromicity observed upon MB binding to
the dsDNA. Indeed, as can be seen in Figure 1b, addition of both groove binders results
in a drastic increase in MB absorbance, which almost reaches the value
of free MB. This verifies the binding of MB to the minor groove of
dsDNA under the current buffer conditions, which also agrees with
previous theoretical predictions.64

Next, we set out to investigate the interaction of MB with a selection
of representative DNA origami nanostructures (see Figure 2). In particular, we chose
two 3D DNA origami nanostructures, that is, 6HBs65 and 60-helix bundles (60HBs).66 The 6HBs have previously been found to have an extraordinarily high
structural stability under physiological conditions, whereas more
complex 3D structures such as the 60HB are typically less stable.67,68 Furthermore, we also selected three differently shaped 2D DNA origami.
The Z shape69 is also designed on the honeycomb
lattice and features a chiral shape that may serve as an indicator
for visualizing MB-binding-induced structural distortions by atomic
force microscopy (AFM).27 The Rothemund
triangle,4 on the other hand, has previously
been identified as a potent drug delivery vehicle in vivo.18 It is designed on the square lattice and appears
highly strained (see the corresponding CanDo70,71 simulation in Figure 2). In order to evaluate the effect of such strain on MB binding,
we have also evaluated a more relaxed DNA origami structure in the
form of a bow tie that is designed on the same lattice but twist-corrected.69 These DNA origami nanostructures are characterized
by AFM in Figure 2,
both directly after assembly and after subsequent exposure to 20 μM
MB. Obviously, all DNA origami nanostructures remain intact upon MB
exposure. Furthermore, no major structural distortions induced by
MB binding can be observed by AFM. This is in agreement with the minor
groove binding of MB, which does not require any major structural
alterations of the DNA helices.54,55,64,72 Intercalators, on the other hand,
may induce unwinding of the helices and thereby twisting of the DNA
origami.16,27,28 Such a twisting
should be visible at least for the Z-shaped DNA origami.27

Figure 2 CanDo70,71 simulations and AFM images (1
× 1 μm2) of 6HBs (height scales 4.5 nm), 60HBs
(height scales 12
nm), Z-shaped DNA origami (height scales 3 nm), triangles (height
scales 3 nm), and bow ties (height scales 2 nm) before and after exposure
to 20 μM MB. The color coding in the CanDo simulations indicates
the lattice type (red—honeycomb, blue—square).

The binding of MB to these DNA
origami nanostructures was investigated
by UV–vis spectroscopy. In addition to the DNA origami, we
also used synthetic dsDNA (15 bp) with a GC content close to that
of the M13 scaffold (40%) as a reference. All the UV–vis spectra
shown in Figure 3a
were characterized by a decrease in the absorbance of MB at 668 nm
with increasing DNA concentration. As in the case of genomic dsDNA,
no bathochromic shift of the absorption peak is observed, indicating
the binding of MB to the minor groove.

Figure 3 (a) Representative UV–vis
spectra of 20 μM MB in 1×
TAE buffer containing 10 mM MgCl2 and different phosphate
concentrations of dsDNA and different DNA origami nanostructures,
respectively. The spectra are normalized to the absorbance at 668
nm in the absence of any DNA. (b) Representative normalized MB absorbance
at 668 nm as a function of phosphate concentration. (c) Corresponding
binding isotherms. The solid red lines in (c) are linear fits to the
data that have been used for the determination of Kd values. R2 values of the
fits are given in the plots. Error bars in (b,c) represent standard
deviations obtained by averaging over five individual measurements.
For Kd determination, these concentration-dependent
measurements have been repeated at least once (see Methods).

The normalized absorbance values shown in Figure 3b are found to saturate at
high DNA concentrations,
indicating that at these concentrations, all MB in solution is DNA-bound.
For all DNA origami nanostructures investigated here, saturation occurs
at phosphate concentrations between 35 and 55 μM and with different
saturation values of the absorbance. Also, the obtained loading efficiencies
differ significantly for the different DNA origami nanostructures
(see Table S1 for base pair contents) and
range from about 5700 MB molecules per DNA origami for the 60HB to
about 7400 for the bow tie (see Table S1).

The differences in the MB–DNA interaction observed
in Figure 3a,b were
assessed
more quantitatively by converting the concentration-dependent absorbance
values at 668 nm into binding isotherms (see Figure 3c) as described by Zhang and Tang.58 From the linear fits to the data shown in Figure 3c, dissociation constants Kd can be calculated as the ratio of intercept
and slope.58 This approach is frequently
employed for the quantitative investigation of the interaction of
DNA with both intercalators58,73 and groove binders.74,75

All the determined Kd values are
compared
in Figure 4. Obviously,
DNA origami 6HBs present a Kd value virtually
identical to that of synthetic dsDNA with the same GC content. This
is to be expected because the 6HBs have been designed on a honeycomb
lattice with 10.5 bp per helical turn and should thus exhibit a DNA
topology close to the canonical B-form. The same argument of DNA topology
also holds true for the 60HB, which indeed has a similar Kd as the 6HB and the dsDNA. Although in such compact 3D
DNA origami nanostructures, access of MB to the inner helices may
be restricted because of the shielding by the outer helices, this
effect appears to be of minor importance in the 60HB.

Figure 4 Determined Kd values for the investigated
DNA structures. Values are presented as averages over n independent
concentration series with the standard error of the mean as error
bars (see Methods).

Such geometric effects, however, should be entirely absent
in structures
that consist just of a single honeycomb “unit cell”
such as the 6HB or in objects that are purely two-dimensional. The
latter is true for the Z-shaped 2D DNA origami that was constructed
using the honeycomb lattice and is thus designed to exhibit 10.5 bp/turn
just as the 6HB and the 60HB. Surprisingly, however, the Kd determined for the Z-shaped DNA origami is more than
twice as large as those of the 6HB and the dsDNA (see Figure 4). On the basis of the overlap
rule of standard error bars,76 the difference
between the Z shape and the dsDNA is estimated to be statistically
significant with p < 0.05.

In addition to
the honeycomb lattice-based DNA origami, we have
also evaluated MB binding to two 2D DNA origami nanostructures based
on the square lattice.4,69 These structures are designed
with 10.67 bp/turn and thus exhibit DNA topologies different from
the canonical B-form of dsDNA.4 Efficient
minor groove binding of MB64,72 and other molecules77,78 typically requires a tight fit. Therefore, underwinding of the helices
will result not only in an increased spacing of base pairs but also
in a widened minor groove79 and should
thereby reduce the binding affinity of MB. This is in contrast to
the case of intercalation, where underwinding results in lower Kd values because of easier access to the widened
gaps between base pairs.16,28 In agreement with this
hypothesis, both DNA origami triangles and twist-corrected bow-tie
structures show Kd values slightly higher
than that of dsDNA, although the effect is surprisingly small (see Figure 4).

Of all the
DNA origami nanostructures studied in this work, the
Z shape shows the strongest deviation from B-DNA, even though it is
designed on the same honeycomb lattice as the 6HB and the 60HB, both
of which show Kd values similar to dsDNA.
We speculate that the high Kd of the Z-shaped
DNA origami is caused by the presence of DNA topologies different
from the canonical B-form. Despite being based on the honeycomb lattice,
such non-B topologies may occur transiently, that is, resulting from
thermal fluctuations. In the Z-shaped DNA origami, all helices are
aligned parallel to its long axis, including those in the two arms
(see Figure 2). These
arms are therefore comparatively floppy and subject to strong fluctuations.
These fluctuations travel from helix to helix via the crossovers,
thereby inducing an oscillatory over- and underwinding of the helices
in the vicinity of the crossovers (see CanDo70,71 simulations in the Supporting Information). Because groove binding requires a tight fit, both over- and underwinding
will result in reduced binding and in sum to an increased Kd. The bow-tie design also features only parallel
helices and could therefore show a similar behavior as the Z shape.
However, because of the intrinsic underwinding of the helices in the
square lattice, fluctuations in the bow tie may lead even to slightly
improved groove binding because of the occurrence of transient B-form
topologies. Note that in the case of intercalation, such fluctuations
will not lead to different Kd values because
here overwinding and underwinding result in lower and higher binding
affinities, respectively, and thus compensate each other.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have investigated the interaction of the drug
MB with different DNA origami nanostructures under conditions that
result in binding to the minor groove. The DNA origami superstructure
is found to have a noticeable influence on the binding efficiency
of MB. In particular, non-B topologies as for instance found in designs
using the square lattice with 10.67 bp/turn may result in reduced
binding affinity. Furthermore, also flexible DNA origami shapes that
are prone to structural fluctuations may exhibit reduced groove binding
because of the induction of transient over- and underwound DNA topologies.
These issues should be considered when rationally designing DNA origami
nanostructures for drug delivery applications employing groove-binding
drugs.

Methods
Preparation of dsDNA Samples
For
the initial experiments
addressing the binding mode of MB, lyophilized genomic dsDNA from
salmon testes (Alfa Aesar) was dissolved at the desired concentration
either in high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-grade water
(Carl Roth) or in 1× TAE (Calbiochem) with 10 mM MgCl2 (Sigma-Aldrich). MB, spermidine, and netropsin (all Sigma-Aldrich)
were added to achieve the desired concentrations.

For comparison
with the DNA origami nanostructures, synthetic dsDNA was prepared
by hybridization of two complementary oligonucleotides (Metabion)
with the sequences 5′-TTG GAA CAG CAT TGA-3′ and 5′-TCA
ATG CTG TTC CAA-3′. To this end, the readily mixed sample (100
μM of each strand in 1× TAE with 10 mM MgCl2) was heated to 94 °C in a thermocycler Primus 25 advanced (PEQLAB),
kept at this temperature for 5 min, and cooled down to 20 °C
with a cooling rate of 1.5 °C per minute.

DNA Origami Synthesis and
Purification
All DNA origami
nanostructures were fabricated as previously reported (see below).
All structures are based on the 7249 nt long M13mp18 scaffold (purchased
from Tilibit Nanosystems).Triangle:

After assembly, the DNA origami
nanostructures were
purified as described previously80 by spin-filtering
(Amicon Ultra filters from Millipore with 100 kDa molecular weight
cutoff) and washing with 1× TAE supplemented with 10 mM MgCl2.

Determination of DNA Origami Concentrations
The concentrations
of the DNA origami after purification were determined by UV–vis
absorbance measurements using an Implen Nanophotometer P330 operated
in dsDNA mode. Because different DNA origami nanostructures feature
different numbers of base pairs and unpaired nucleotides, the so-determined
concentration values had to be corrected.

The measured concentration cm is a result of the combined absorption the
single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and the dsDNA fractions in the DNA origami.
Because the extinction of ssDNA is about 1.5 times higher than that
of dsDNA,82 the real concentration creal is given by  Here, x is the fraction of
paired bases relative to the total number of nucleotides (paired and
unpaired) in the DNA origami. The numbers of base pairs and nucleotides
of the DNA origami used in this work are given in Table S1.

UV–Vis Spectroscopy
UV–vis
absorbance
spectra with a spectral range from 200 to 800 nm were recorded with
an Implen Nanophotometer P330 equipped with a sub-microliter cell.
The sample volume for each measurement was 2 μL. After each
measurement, the cell was washed at least twice with HPLC-grade water.

To record the UV–vis spectra of samples with different DNA
concentrations, a 20 μM MB solution in 1× TAE with 10 mM
MgCl2 was measured first. Then, a small aliquot of a DNA-containing
solution (80–300 μM in phosphates depending on the DNA
structure, 1× TAE, 10 mM MgCl2, 20 μM MB) was
added to the initial MB solution and mixed well. After recording the
UV–vis spectra of the resulting solution, the addition and
measurement cycle was repeated several times to record a complete
concentration series.

Determination of Kd Values
For the determination of the dissociation constants,
the measured
absorption at 668 nm was averaged over at least five individual measurements
at each DNA concentration in a concentration series, and the resulting
standard deviations were treated as error limits. After transforming
the data according to the protocol of Zhang and Tang,58 the Kd of each concentration
series was determined from a linear fit to the data with instrumental
weighting of the errors (see below). For each DNA origami, this determination
of Kd has been performed for two to three
independent concentration series. The so-obtained Kd values for each DNA origami were averaged, and the error
limits of the individual linear fits were used for determining the
standard error of the mean for each Kd value given in Figure 4 via propagation of error (see Table S3).

The binding constant Kd follows from the relation  Here, [Pho] refers
to the molar concentration
of phosphates, which has been used instead of the concentration of
base pairs in order to account for the different fractions of paired
and unpaired nucleotides in the different DNA origami designs. Δεap is the difference between the measured extinction coefficient
of the DNA–MB solution, εa, which features
both DNA-bound and free MB and the extinction coefficient of free
MB in a solution without DNA, εf, with  Here, εa and εf are determined
by dividing the measured absorbance values
by the molar MB concentration, which was kept constant at 20 μM
in all experiments.

Δε represents the difference
of the extinction coefficients
of DNA-bound MB, εb, and free MB, εf, that is,  

The dissociation constant Kd is
then
determined by plotting  versus [Pho] and fitting the data with
a linear function. In this case, the linear fit has a slope of  and intercepts the y-axis
at . Therefore, dividing
the intercept by the
slope yields the binding constant Kd.

AFM Imaging
For AFM imaging, a 5 μL droplet of
each DNA origami sample (10 nM in 1× TAE with 10 mM MgCl2) with or without 20 μM MB was deposited on a freshly
cleaved mica substrate. After adding 100 μL of 1× TAE with
10 mM MgCl2 to spread the sample over the whole substrate
surface, the sample was incubated for 5–15 min, subsequently
dipped in HPLC-grade water, and dried in a stream of ultrapure air.
AFM imaging was performed in air using Agilent 5100 AFM in intermittent
contact mode and HQ:NSC18/Al BS cantilevers from MikroMasch.
