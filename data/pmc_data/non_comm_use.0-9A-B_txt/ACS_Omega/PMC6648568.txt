Analytical methods often involve
expensive instrumentation and
tedious sample pretreatment for an analyte detection. Being toxic
and detrimental to human health, sensing of cyanide (CN–), fluoride (F–), chloride (Cl–), bromide (Br–), nitrate (NO3–), acetate (CH3COO–), and bisulfate
(HSO4–) is performed by a boron-based
molecular receptor, N,N,N,3,5-pentamethyl-4-{2-thia-9-boratricyclo[8.4.0.03,8]tetradeca-1(10),3(8),4,6,11,13-hexaen-9-yl}anili-nium (1), and the three newly designed receptors from it. Thermodynamics,
electronic structure, and photophysical properties are computed by
employing density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density
functional theory (TD-DFT) to explore selective sensing of these anions
and its mechanism. Free-energy changes (ΔG)
and binding energies (ΔE) suggest that among
these anions, only binding of CN– and F– is thermodynamically feasible with a very strong binding affinity
with the receptors. Boron atoms containing positive natural charges
act as the electrophilic centers to bind the anions involving a 2p–2p
orbital overlap resulting in charge transfer. In the receptor–analyte
complexes with CN– and F–, fluorescence
is quenched due to the intramolecular charge transfer transitions
(π–π* transitions in the case of the receptors
lead to fluorescence), internal conversion, and associated configurational
changes. Among the six tested functionals, CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d) is found to be the most accurate one. The designed receptors
are better fluorescent probes for F– and CN–, demonstrating their importance for the practical
utility.

==== Body
Introduction
The deadly poisonous
nature of the cyanide ion (CN–) makes it very toxic
to human body.1 The
binding between CN– and heme unit of cytochrome c causes paralysis of the cellular respiration and ultimately
leads to serious central nervous system damages.2,3 As
the versatility of cyanide reagents in industry is depicted by their
role in synthesis, metallurgy, etc., their release into the environment
is unavoidable.4,5 On the other hand, fluoride (F–) has so many beneficial effects like treating osteoporosis,
protection of dental health, etc. when consumed in a controlled manner.6,7 But fluoride overdose causes pathological disorders like skeletal
and tooth fluorosis, kidney failure, urolithiasis, and may even lead
to death.8−10 Thus, World Health Organization (WHO) has fixed the
maximum permitted limit at 0.07 and 1.5 mg/L, respectively, for CN– and F– in drinking water.11,12 In connection to these facts and due to the continuous discharge
of F– and CN– into the environment,
the development of a method for the accurate trace-level quantification
of these anions is indispensable. Although various analytical methods
like potentiometry, absorption spectrometry, inductively coupled plasma
emission spectrometry, etc. are used for detection of trace levels
of F– and CN– and other anions
(<0.1 μM), they require expensive instrumentation and tedious
pretreatment of samples.13−16 So, development of simple, reliable, inexpensive,
and rapid methods and designing of molecular probes for the recognition
of CN– and F– in particular and
other important anions in general have become a prime aim of research.17−19

The fluorescence sensing method can be utilized as a tool
for anion
and metal-ion detection due to real-time behavior, high sensitivity,
and selectivity.20−22 The sensing phenomenon is accomplished in two steps:
first, binding of target analyte to the receptor selectively; second,
converting the binding event into a visually detectable fluorescence
signal. The signal can be either switched on or switched off depending
on the electronic and structural properties of the receptor upon analyte
binding. Of the numerous approaches for analyte recognition, such
as hydrogen bonding,23−26 anion affinity to metal complexes,27,28 nucleophilic
addition,29−32 etc., chemical reaction-based fluorescent probes attracted attention
due to their high sensitivity and selectivity. Most of the experimental
studies mainly focus on the synthesis of fluorescent chemosensors
and their characterization by absorption without providing any detailed
description about sensing mechanisms, such as photoinduced electron
transfer (PET),33−35 intramolecular charge transfer (ICT),36,37 etc. Nevertheless, understanding the sensing mechanism is highly
crucial and significant for the design and application of better fluorescent
chemosensors.

The possible binding of CN– to
triarylboranes
(TABs) has gone overlooked regardless of the observed precipitation
of cesium ions by [Ph3CN]− for a long
period.38 Jackle et al. demonstrated that
the polymers having triarylborane constituents can be used as probes
for recognition of CN– in organic solvents.39 Matsumoto et al. reported a cationic borane, N,N,N,3,5-pentamethyl-4-{2-thia-9-boratricyclo[8.4.0.03,8]tetradeca-1(10),3(8),4,6,11,13-hexaen-9-yl}anili-nium (1), containing a 9-thia-10-boraanthracene moiety substituted
at boron by the cationic anilium group [4-(Me3N)-2,6-Me2-C6H2]+ shown in Scheme 1, which binds both
CN– and F– selectively in tetrahydrofuran
(THF) solvent.40 For the selectivity of
cationic borane 1 toward anions, it is demonstrated that
both steric and electronic effects are found to contribute.40

Scheme 1 Structures of Receptors 1, 2, 3, and 4
For the exploration of anion-sensing process, various
spectroscopic
techniques, including time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy, time-resolved
absorption spectroscopy, proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy, etc., are utilized. These techniques offer some
indirect information about the molecular geometries and their photophysical
properties. The density functional theory and time-dependent density
functional theory (DFT/TD-DFT) methods have proved to be effective
for studying the sensing mechanism of some anion fluorescent chemosensors.41−48 Hence, DFT/TD-DFT methods have been selected as the methods of choice
to comprehend the details of anion binding and overall sensing process
in this paper. The existing literature clearly lacks a detailed theoretical
electronic structure insight into anion sensing of TABs and hence
their fluorescence mechanism for sensing. Furthermore, no study has
shown the detailed assignment to the electronic levels involved for
absorption and emission in the case of TAB-based anion sensors. On
top of that, no efforts are made to perform the DFT assessment for
anionic sensors, particularly TABs to set up a protocol for accurately
exploring their optical properties to assess their anion-sensing capability.
The present work deals with seven different anions for fluorometric
sensing, performs the assessment of six different DFT functionals,
proposes three new triarylborane-based sensors, and provides mechanistic
details and factors influencing sensing.

So as to reinforce
the experimental outcomes and to offer additional
insights into the design of new fluorescent molecular sensors, we
performed the ground-state and excited-state computations for 1 and its various anion complexes using DFT and TD-DFT methods.40 Learning from the outcomes related to 1, we carried out three substitutions in 1 separately
to design three new receptors theoretically and checked their anion-sensing
properties. The substitutions were done as follows: (a) the nitrogen
atom of the anilium group was substituted by phosphorus atom producing
receptor (3,5-dimethyl-4-{2-thia-9-boratricyclo[8.4.0.03,8]tetradeca-1(10),3(8),4,6,11,13-hexaen-9-yl}phenyl)trimethylphosphanium
(2), (b) the sulfur atom was substituted by oxygen atom
to produce receptor N,N,N,3,5-pentamethyl-4-{2-oxa-9-boratricyclo[8.4.0.03,8]tetradeca-1(10),3(8),4,6,11,13-hexaen-9-yl}anili-nium (3), and (c) the nitrogen atom was substituted by phosphorus atom and
the sulfur atom by oxygen atom at the same time to produce (3,5-dimethyl-4-{2-oxa-9-boratricyclo[8.4.0.03,8]tetradeca-1(10),3(8),4,6,11,13-hexaen-9-yl}phenyl)trimethylphosphanium
(4), as shown in Scheme 1. The feasibility of these substitutions was checked
by calculating the free-energy changes; the negative free-energy changes
indicate that these substitutions are thermodynamically feasible (see Thermodynamics of Chemical Substitutions and Receptor–Analyte
Interactions). Receptors 2, 3, and 4 are proposed theoretically and there is no earlier report
about them. To check the thermodynamic feasibility of anion binding
to 1, 2, 3, and 4 and to predict the selective binding of various anions with these
receptors, we calculated free-energy changes (ΔG) and binding energies (ΔE). Furthermore,
the electronic excitation energies, de-excitation energies, and associated
frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) in 1, 2, 3, and 4 and their various anion complexes
have been analyzed and reported in this paper to demonstrate the anion-sensing
mechanism of all of the receptors.

Results and Discussion
Ground-State
Geometries
The ground-state optimized
structures of 1–4 are shown in Figure 1, whereas those for 1F–4F and 1CN–4CN are shown in Figure S1 of the
Supporting Information. The corresponding minima of the ground (S0) and first excited (S1) states potential energy
curves show the same configurations as that of the optimized geometries
(see Figure 2 for 1 and 2; Figure S2 for 1F and 1CN). For the sake of convenience,
the anthracene-type moiety containing boron and sulfur/oxygen is named
A and the phenyl moiety containing ammonium/phosphonium group is named
B. This nomenclature is followed throughout the discussion. The computed
optimized geometrical parameters in the ground and excited states
of all of the receptors and receptor–analyte complexes are
given in Table 1 for 1 and 1F and Tables S1–S7 for rest of the molecules, which display a close agreement with
the available reported X-ray data.40 The
comparison between computation and experiment over the 1 and 1F geometrical data is presented in Table 1. Among all of the functionals
employed, CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d) gives the best accuracy. For instance,
the CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d) computed geometrical data of 1F give the closest agreement with the corresponding X-ray data having
the lowest value of mean absolute deviation (MAD) of 0.091 Å
and 3.27°, respectively, in bond lengths and bond angles (Table 2) (see Table S8 for other functionals). The consistency
between the calculated and X-ray data validates the method CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d)
and henceforth its use for calculating further properties. Moreover,
the same functional is found to reproduce the absorption spectra with
the best accuracy (see UV–Vis Absorption
Spectra and Molecular Orbital Analysis).

Table 3 accommodates
the natural charges on some selected atoms in 1–4, 1F–4F, and 1CN–4CN. The positive charges on the central boron
atoms in 1–4 indicate their electrophilic
nature and thus are most prone to nucleophilic addition with the anions.
After analyte addition, the amount of positive charges on the B atoms
in 1–4 gets reduced, suggesting shifting
of electron density from the analytes to the B centers, for example,
the charge on B1 atom in 1 is reduced by 0.045 and 0.554
after F– and CN– addition, respectively.
The amounts of charge transfer (ΔQ) from the
analytes to receptors are quantified in the last column of Table 3. In 1F–4F, there is less transfer of charge from F– to the receptors, whereas in 1CN–4CN, charge transfer occurs to a greater extent from CN– to the receptors. This is attributed to the greater
electronegativity of fluorine than carbon in cyanide responsible for
less charge transfer from F– to the receptors than
CN–.

Thermodynamics of Chemical Substitutions
and Receptor–Analyte
Interactions
The feasibility of substitutions to 1 to form 2, 3, and 4 was checked
by calculating the free-energy changes; the negative free-energy changes
indicate that these substitutions are thermodynamically feasible (see Table 4). To know the feasibility
of nucleophilic binding between the receptors 1–4 and the selected anions, viz., CN–, F–, Cl–, Br–, NO3–, CH3COO–,
and HSO4–, the free-energy changes (ΔG) of binding and the binding energies (ΔE) were computed, which are shown in Figures 3 and 4, respectively. Figure 3 displaying the calculated
ΔG values demonstrates that only CN– and F– binding is thermodynamically feasible because
of high negative values. Furthermore, the high negative binding energy
(ΔE) values (Figure 4) of 1–4 for CN– and F– infer that 1–4 strongly bind to these anions than
the rest of the anions considered herein. Both ΔG and ΔE follow the same trend across the receptor–analyte
interactions. All other ions, viz., Cl–, Br–, NO3–, CH3COO–, and HSO4–, have
rather a very weak affinity to 1–4 or do not bind at all, which can be attributed to the steric effect;
CN– and F– being less bulky than
other ions are stronger nucleophiles, thus exhibiting higher binding
affinity and feasibility. Between CN– and F–, the latter has a stronger affinity to bind to the
receptors, again attributing to the smaller size of F– compared to CN–.

Configurational Changes on Analyte Binding
The geometry
of receptors undergoes an obvious change after the electron-deficient
boron atoms in 1–4 capture CN– and F–. After F– binding, the changes in bond angles C2–B1–C31, C2–B1–C41,
C31–B1–C41, C2–B1–F52, C31–B1–F52,
and C41–B1–F52 (see Figure 1 for the labeling of atoms) of 111.9, 116.7,
104.4, 106.8, 109.1, and 107.6°, respectively, from 1 reflect the change in geometry in 1F (see Table 1). Similarly, in 2F, 3F, 4F, and 1CN–4CN, the geometrical changes can be seen from Tables S1–S7. In addition, the change
of geometry at the boron center is indicated by the change in hybridization
from sp2 to sp3 on CN– and
F– addition, as shown in the hybrid and AO (%) columns
of Table 5. It is evident
that the sp2 hybridization of 1 along the
B1–C2, B1–C31, and B1–C41 bonds changes to sp3 in 1F and 1CN as can be seen in Table 5. This change in hybridization
influences the anion-sensing mechanism as discussed later.

Molecular
Orbital Diagram
The molecular orbital (MO)
diagrams for 1F, 1CN, and the receptor–chloride
complex (1Cl) presented in Figure 5 (MO diagrams for 1 and CN– are shown in Figure S3) show the compositions of some frontier
molecular orbitals (FMOs) like LUMO + 4 to HOMO – 4. It is
to be noted that in 1F, the 2py orbital of boron atom (B1) combines with the 2py orbital of fluoride (F–) analyte, indicating
a significant interaction between them that we can refer as p–p
interaction. As signaled by the coefficients, the orbital contribution
from the F– and CN– in the FMOs
is different, i.e., 2py (0.30) in HOMO
– 1 of 1F and 2py (0.16)
in HOMO – 1 of 1CN. This difference in the orbital
coefficients supports the different binding energies for F– and CN– (see Figure 4). Likewise, the coefficient of 3py (0.10) in HOMO – 1 of 1Cl reveals that the receptor–analyte interaction is weaker than
F– and CN–. Greater the coefficient,
more the orbital interaction and stronger the binding. Thus, higher
binding energy for F– has the origin in the higher
degree of orbital interaction between F– and 1 in comparison to CN– and 1 and all of the other analytes with 1. There occurs
a change of arrangement of the “2p” orbitals in the
case of 1 and 1F on the basis of their energy.
In 1, the “2p (boron)” orbitals that have
major contributions to the FMOs are 2py (HOMO – 1), 2pz (HOMO), and 2px (LUMO + 4), whereas in 1F, the
major contributions from the 2p (boron) orbitals are found in LUMO
+ 1 involving 2px and HOMO – 1
consisting of 2py, in which the 2py orbital of F– participates
in the MO formation. This shows that 2py of boron (B) and 2py of F– are involved in the interaction, and this is likewise true for other
analytes such as CN–, Cl–, etc.
Interestingly, as mentioned, the order of energy of 2p (B) orbitals
of 1F is not the same as of 1. This is due
to the presence of F–, which breaks this order in 1, enabling the 2p (B) to participate in the interaction with
the F– electrons.

UV–Vis Absorption
Spectra and Molecular Orbital Analysis
The electronic transition
energies of 1–4, 1CN–4CN, and 1F–4F were calculated by using their ground-state
optimized structures. For all of the receptors and receptor–analyte
complexes, the first 15 absorption transitions were calculated. Table 6 shows the comparison
between experimental results and the calculated absorption profiles
employing various functionals (total six) for 1, 1F, and 1CN.40 The
electronic transition energies, FMOs involved, and the corresponding
oscillator strengths (f) of all of the 15 absorption
transitions for all of the receptors and the receptor–analyte
complexes are given in Table S9 (and the
same for 1, 1F, and 1CN with
functionals other than CAM-B3LYP are provided in Table S10).

Figure 6 displays
the first six electronic transitions of all of the receptors and receptor–analyte
complexes highlighting the highest-intensity transition corresponding
to the largest oscillator strength value (red bars) in each case as
done in an earlier work.49 For 1, the calculated first singlet transition S0 →
S1 is found at 371 nm (3.34 eV) with an oscillator strength
of 0.1657 while S0 → S1 transitions for 1F and 1CN are located at 245 nm (5.06 eV) and
253 nm (4.90 eV), respectively, with oscillator strengths of 0.0018
and 0.0014. Such very low oscillator strengths for 1F and 1CN indicate the absorption quenching when F– and CN– bind to 1,
showing a fine agreement with the experimental observations. In the
newly designed receptors 2, 3, and 4, the calculated first singlet transitions S0 →
S1 are found at 410 nm (3.02 eV), 426 nm (2.91 eV), and
316 nm (3.92 eV) with oscillator strengths of 0.1750, 0.1561, and
0.1674, respectively, while those for 2F, 3F, 4F, 2CN, 3CN, and 4CN are located at 254 nm (4.88 eV), 242 nm (5.12 eV), 248
nm (4.99 eV), 256 nm (4.84 eV), 247 nm (5.02 eV), and 253 nm (4.90
eV) with oscillator strengths of 0.0016, 0.0001, 0.0001, 0.0005, 0.0001,
and 0.0001, respectively. These low oscillator strengths for S0 → S1 transitions of 2F–4F and 2CN–4CN again refer
to the absorption quenching due to the binding of F– and CN– to 2, 3, and 4.

level of theory. Red indicates the highest intense absorption peaks
(energy is unscaled).

Figures 7 and S4–S6 display the FMOs and their corresponding
orbital energies in 1, 1F, 1CN; 2, 2F, 2CN; 3, 3F, 3CN, and 4, 4F, 4CN, respectively, for the most probable and dominant
transitions. For 1, 2, 3, and 4, the most probable and the lowest-energy S0 →
S1 transitions are assigned to HOMO → LUMO (69.2%,
which represents the probability of transition), HOMO → LUMO
(69.1%), HOMO → LUMO (68.2%), and HOMO → LUMO (68.1%),
respectively. In 1–4, both highest
occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital (LUMO) are centered on fragment A, which reveals that their
S0 → S1 transition is basically π
→ π* transition (Figures 7 and S4–S6) for each
case. For 1F, the calculated maximum-intensity absorption
peak (less significant as f = 0.0184) arises from
transition to the second singlet excited state (S0 →
S2) assigned to HOMO → LUMO + 4 (49.7%). The HOMO
is localized at fragment A, while the LUMO + 4 shows a complete shift
to fragment B after binding. In the case of 1CN, the
calculated maximum-intensity absorption peak (f =
0.0294) of less significance is shown to be due to transition to the
third singlet excited state (S0 → S3)
assigned to HOMO → LUMO + 4 (52.1%). The HOMO is budged at
A, while the LUMO + 4 gets shifted to B. The FMOs suggest that the
S0 → S2 and S0 → S3 transitions for 1F and 1CN, respectively,
are intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transitions from A to B driven
by addition of electron-rich fluoride and cyanide ions. As described
in 1F and 1CN, the calculated maximum-intensity
absorption peaks for 2F (f = 0.0211), 2CN (f = 0.0198), 3F (f = 0.0161), 3CN (f = 0.0151), 4F (f = 0.0162), and 4CN (f = 0.0161) are shown to arise from S0 →
S4, S0 → S5, S0 → S3, S0 → S3, S0 → S4, and S0 → S5 transitions assigned to HOMO → LUMO + 4 (43.4%), HOMO
→ LUMO + 3 (35.0%); HOMO → LUMO + 3 (45.2%), HOMO →
LUMO + 3 (51.2%), HOMO → LUMO + 4 (49.1%), and HOMO →
LUMO + 5 (37.1%), respectively. Similarly, in 2F–4F and 2CN–4CN, the HOMOs
are budged at their corresponding A, whereas their respective LUMO
+ 4, LUMO + 3, LUMO + 3, LUMO + 3, LUMO + 4, and LUMO + 5 are completely
shifted to B. Thus, the FMOs indicate that these maximum-intensity
absorption transitions in 2F–4F and 2CN–4CN are intramolecular charge transfer
(ICT) transitions (Figures 7 and S4–S6). This can arise
due to analyte binding through 2py–2py orbital overlap interaction, followed by charge
redistribution, where the boron atoms acquire partial negative charges
as demonstrated in Figure 5 and Table 3, respectively.

ground state

ground state and the excited state (1F*), and (III) 1CN in the ground state and the excited state (1CN*) at the CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d) level using CPCM solvation model.

ICT is often confused with photoinduced
electron transfer (PET).
PET is an accepted mechanism for “turn-on” chemosensors,
which fluoresce in the presence of analytes only.50−54 These sensors are the electron donor–acceptor
systems. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of donor lies
in between the HOMO and LUMO of an acceptor. Upon photoexcitation,
one of the HOMO electrons of acceptor gets excited to its LUMO. The
orbital vacancy created in HOMO of acceptor is filled due to the rapid
transfer of the electron from HOMO of donor, stopping the radiative
decay of the excited electron of acceptor. This results in fluorescence
quenching or a very weak fluorescence. Due to PET, the electron density
decreases on donor on binding an analyte, leading to the HOMO energy
lowering in comparison to the acceptor HOMO, thus stopping the electron
transfer completely. This situation leads to turn-on of the fluorescence.
But the absorption quenching in 1F–4F and 1CN–4CN is because of the ICT
observed in their less significant transitions and the geometrical
changes at their boron centers compared to 1–4 on F– and CN– binding.
It should be mentioned that for all of the receptors and receptor–analyte
complexes, all of the chosen functionals converge to the similar results
for the electronic transitions (Tables S9 and S10). For example, as indicated by CAM-B3LYP, all other functionals
show that for 1–4, the most intense
transition is S0 → S1 occurring from
HOMO → LUMO. Similarly, all of the functionals show that in
the case of 1F, 2F, 3F, 4F, 1CN, 2CN, 3CN,
and 4CN, the calculated maximum-intensity absorption
peaks arise from S0 → S2, S0 → S4, S0 → S3, S0 → S4, S0 → S3, S0 → S5, S0 → S3, and S0 → S5, respectively,
as predicted by CAM-B3LYP (Tables S9 and S10).

Excited-State Geometries
Followed from analytical science,
the emission of a dye is more sensitive compared to its absorption.55 To establish the sensing mechanism, study of
the excited-state geometry is also very crucial. Figure S7 displays the optimized geometries of the first excited
states (S1) of 1–4, 1F–4F, and 1CN–4CN. While comparing the ground-state and the first excited-state
configurations, the maximum geometrical deviations occur along angles
C32–C31–B1 (2.0°), C32–C31–B1 (2.0°),
C31–B1–C41 (7.9°), and C2–B1–C31
(8.0°) in 1, 2, 1F, and 2CN, respectively, as indicated in Tables 1 and S2, S3. Scanning
of the first excited-state (S1) potential energy surfaces
(PES) has been carried out along the coordinates mentioned above,
which show maximum configurational changes from the ground state to
the excited states. The minima of the S1 potential energy
curves of 1, 2, 1F, and 2CN (Figures 2 and S2) provide the same configurations
as those of their respective first excited-state optimized geometries
(Figure S7). As it is a well established
fact that twist in excited-state configuration to that of the ground-state
configuration may lead to a significant internal conversion (IC),
energy loss, and thus fluorescence quenching.56,57 This effect of configurational change on the fluorescence quenching
is observed here and is discussed in the subsequent section.

Sensing
Mechanism
To appreciate the sensing mechanism
and to understand the complete ICT process in detail, we theoretically
studied the emission properties for 1, 1F, and 1CN. Furthermore, the emission properties of the
new designed receptors 2–4 and their
fluoride and cyanide addition products 2F–4F and 2CN–4CN have been
studied for understanding their sensing mechanism. The electron-deficient
boron centers in 1–4 act as an electrophilic
center to capture the added F– and CN–, which leads to change in the geometry in 1F–4F and 1CN–4CN from that
of 1–4 at the boron center. The TD-DFT
method was used to explore the emission properties and to understand
the fluorescent sensing mechanism of 1 and the new designed
receptors 2–4. Figures 7 and S4–S6 display the relevant FMOs, which are involved in emission. Table 7 (for 1–4, 1F–4F, and 1CN–4CN at the CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d) level
of theory) and Table S11 (for 1, 1F, and 1CN using different functionals
other than CAM-B3LYP) show the de-excitation energies, corresponding
oscillator strengths, and the transition compositions of all of the
receptors and receptor–analyte complexes. As stated by Kasha’s
rule, the fluorescence takes place solely from the lowest singlet
excited state (S1).58 In the
case of an electronic excitation to a higher state, the fast relaxation
(10–14–10–11 s) of excited
electrons to the S1 state takes place before any possible
emission to the ground state.58 For checking
the relaxation process from the higher excited states (states where
the receptors and the receptor–analyte complexes get excited
during absorption, i.e., S2, S3, S4, S5, S3, S3, S4, and
S5 for 1F, 1CN, 2F, 2CN, 3F, 3CN, 4F, and 4CN, respectively), the optimization of these
excited states was performed (displayed in Figure S8) and de-excitation energies along with their oscillator
strengths from these higher excited states were calculated (Table S12). As predicted by the TD-DFT results,
the excited-state deactivation processes in 1–4 are not similar to 1F–4F and 1CN–4CN (see Figures 8 and S9–S11). For 1–4, during the excitation
processes, the electron excitations involve the π → π*
transitions from S0 to S1 with oscillator strengths
0.1657, 0.1750, 0.1561, and 0.1674, respectively, and then a simple
dropping of the excited electrons back to S0 occurs with
fluorescence emission, as shown in Figures 7 and S4–S6. The S1 states of 1–4 are shown to be the bright states because of larger oscillator strengths
(0.1626, 0.1727, 0.1656, and 0.1785, respectively) and hence intensities
for their respective S1 → S0 transitions
indicate the allowed relaxation transitions and thus decay in a radiative
manner (fluorescence emission), which is mirrored by the red shift
in calculated emission wavelengths (410, 455, 463, and 367 nm, see Table 7) compared to their
absorption wavelengths of 371, 410, 426, and 316 nm, respectively
(see Table S9).

On the other hand, the excitations
in 1F–4F and 1CN–4CN take place
from the ground states to their respective S2, S3, S4, S5, S3, S3, S4, and S5 states with oscillator strengths 0.0184,
0.0211, 0.0161, 0.0162, 0.0294, 0.0198, 0.0151, and 0.0161, respectively,
resulting in the less significant charge-transfer transitions between
A and B moieties (see Table S11, Figures 7 and S4–S6). The excited electrons in 1F–4F and 1CN–4CN descend step by step from S2, S3, S4, S5 states to S1 through internal
conversion (IC), a nonradiative process (which is indicated by the
de-excitation energies and oscillator strengths of the higher excited-state
emissions in Table S12). The S1 → S0 transitions in 1F–4F and 1CN–4CN, which involve
the charge transfer between fragments A and B (see Figures 7 and S4–S6), are forbidden (as the oscillator strengths are very small, i.e.,
0.0003, 0.0002, 0.0002, 0.0001, 0.0001, 0.0004, 0.0002, and 0.0006),
inferring that S1 states are the dark states. Therefore,
these S1 states decay to their corresponding S0 in a nonradiative manner, indicating the fluorescence quenching.
This nonradiative decay is appreciated by intramolecular charge transfer
where the dissipation of energy through charge transfer induces the
fluorescence quenching.36,59 The lower oscillator
strengths of the de-excitations and thus fluorescence quenching in 1F–4F and 1CN–4CN are in good agreement with their less significant absorption
transitions from S0 → S2–5.

Conclusions
Receptor 1 and three newly designed
receptors (2, 3, and 4), constructed
by systematically
replacing (CH3)3N+ and O of 1 by (CH3)3P+ and S, respectively,
are studied as chemical probes to detect seven anions by DFT and TD-DFT
methods. Among all of the anions, sensing of CN– and F– is found to be thermodynamically feasible
(ΔG = −ve) with large values of −ΔE compared to the rest. Strongest binding is observed for
the smallest F– compared to CN–. In the receptors, the excitation process involves π →
π* transition from S0 → S1, and
the de-excitation from S1 → S0 results
in fluorescence, where each electronic de-excitation has a large oscillator
strength (f ∼ 0.16–0.18). The fluorescence
is quenched once the receptors bind the anions CN– and F–. The electronic structure properties at
the ground and excited states reveal that ICT (from fragment A to
B) occurs during S0 → Sn (n > 1) absorption transitions; emission occurs
involving IC with a significant geometrical change to the receptor–analyte
complexes unlike the emission of the receptors, which is conceived
as the reason for the fluorescence quenching (f ∼
0.0001–0.0006) upon anion binding. Natural population analysis,
hybrids, and MO plots provide a clear picture of receptor–analyte
interactions. The anions bind to the boron centers having partial
positive charges, leading to change of hybridization from sp2 to sp3 in 1–4. Such
interactions involve 2p–2p orbital overlap between the boron
centers of the receptors and the anions accompanied by anion →
receptor charge transfer, quantified in ΔQ.
There is greater degree of charge transfer in the case of CN– (e.g., in 1CN, ΔQ = −0.6829)
than F– (e.g., 1F, ΔQ = −0.4504), which may be because of the electronegativity
difference between fluorine and the carbon of the cyanide analyte.
Among the six different DFT functionals used, CAM-B3LYP gives the
best accuracy to reproduce experimental data (geometries, absorption
and emission peaks) for its augmented largest exact exchange component.
The PES scanning validates the optimized geometries considered in
the ground and excited states, which are subsequently used for different
property calculations. Finally, through this work, a successful design
of molecular probes to detect toxic anions, especially for CN– and F–, via fluorescence phenomenon,
detailed electron structure changes, and sensing mechanism is demonstrated,
which can be used for efficient designing of new boron-based molecular
probes in the future. It is emphasized that the novel receptors 2, 3, and 4 can be further experimentally
synthesized and checked for their applications in the real field.

Theory
and Computational Details
In this work, four cationic receptors, 1 and its three
substituted derivatives, 2, 3, and 4, (Scheme 1), were studied for sensing seven different anionic analytes, CN–, F–, Cl–, Br–, NO3–, CH3COO–, and HSO4–. The
resulting cationic–anionic complexes of 1–4 are referred to as 1CN–4CN, 1F–4F, and so on. All of the theoretical
computations were performed by utilizing the Gaussian 09 program.60 The ground-state (S0) geometrical
parameters of all of the receptors and receptor–analyte complexes
were determined by density functional theory (DFT) without using any
constraints. To check the nature of stationary points (minima), vibrational
frequency analysis was carried out. The electronic excitation energies
over the S0 geometries were computed within the vertical
approximation by using time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT).
The analytical TD-DFT gradients, as implemented in Gaussian 09, were
exploited for the determination of the geometrical parameters of the
first excited states (S1) of all of the receptors and receptor–analyte
complexes.61,62 Spectroscopic properties were
computed by excited-state simulations. The vibrational signatures
of the excited states were determined to check the absence of imaginary
frequencies by employing the numerical differentiation of the TD-DFT
gradients. For all of the ground-state and excited-state DFT and TD-DFT
studies, CAM-B3LYP, Coulomb-attenuating method based on Becke three-parameter
Lee–Yang–Parr functional (65% exchange and 35% correlation
weighting at long range), was employed. The basis for choosing CAM-B3LYP,
a range-separated hybrid functional, is its accuracy similar to the
functionals having 50% exact exchange part or more for charge transfer
(CT) excited-state studies producing more consistent de-excitation
energies.63−66 The 6-31G(d), a split-valence atomic basis set, was employed for
all of the DFT/TD-DFT calculations because 6-31G(d) is well constructed
for the electronic structure calculations in molecules containing
the first and second row elements with a reasonable accuracy.67−70 To further validate the use of CAM-B3LYP for the DFT/TD-DFT calculations,
a series of functionals [CAM-B3LYP {long-range-corrected functional
(LC), 65% exchange and 35% correlation}, M06-2X (meta-generalized
gradient approximation (meta-GGA) functional, with 54% exchange),
B3PW91 (hybrid functional, with 20% exchange), PBEPBE (a hybrid Perdew,
Burke, and Ernzerhof functional, 25% exchange and 75% correlation
weighting), local spin density approximation (LSDA), and HCTH (pure
GGA functional)] were used to carry out a test as reported earlier.45,71−73 The test reveals that out of all of the employed
functionals, CAM-B3LYP having highest exchange part provides excitation
energies, which show a fine agreement with the experiment (see Table 6).40 Thus, all of the DFT/TD-DFT studies were performed at the
CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d) level, which was considered most appropriate for
studying triarylboranes and their derivatives. Grimme and Parac noted
a substantial failure while estimating excitation energies for lowest-lying
π → π* states in oligoacenes by using standard
hybrid functionals in TD-DFT (error > 0.5 eV).74 To address this unexpected and surprising failure of TD-DFT
in these simple valence excitations, Wong and co-workers75,76 and Peng et al.77 showed that some range-separated
functionals,78,79 which possess both an asymptotically
correct contribution of Hartree–Fock (HF) exchange and a position-dependent
admixture, yield significant improvements over the conventional hybrids
in the excitations of oligoacenes and DNA complexes. They observed
that all full-HF-exchange LC functionals gave similar results for
the linear acenes upon employing several range-separated and LC functionals
like CAM-B3LYP, LC-BOP, LC-PBE, LC-ωPBE, and LC-BLYP. The CAM-B3LYP
functional as defined80 has a Coulomb-attenuating
parameter of α + β = 0.65 and −0.65/r dependence for the exchange potential. Hence, the CAM-B3LYP functional
is principally different from other LC functionals considered in the
work of Wong and Hsieh75 because at large
interelectronic distances, it does not include a full 100% HF exchange.
It is also found that the previously obtained systematic errors for
the acene systems by Grimme and Parac74 is mainly due to the HF exchange component rather than the specific
DFT correlation contribution used because similar results were obtained
from other full-exchange LC functionals as well. As the CAM-B3LYP
functional cannot capture the correct 100% asymptotic distance, it
gives inaccurate results. Among all of the functionals employed herein,
the CAM-B3LYP, however, has the highest exchange part (65% exchange
and 35% correlation); thus, it gives the better accuracy and is more
reliable comparatively. In both the ground and excited states, potential
energy surface (PES) scanning was done along the angles over which
maximum configurational change occurs in traversing from S0 to S1 state. It is worth mentioning that the configurations
at the local minima of S0 and S1 potential energy
surfaces are same as those of the corresponding optimized geometries
attained at CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d), validating the structural choice of
optimized ions and complexes given by this method. To take into account
the effect of solvation in tetrahydrofuran (THF, ε = 7.58),
conductor-like polarizable continuum model (CPCM) as implemented in
Gaussian 09 was used in all of the calculations.81 Natural bond orbital (NBO) method using the NBO 3.1 version
as implemented in Gaussian 09 program was exploited for performing
the natural population analysis at the CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of
theory.82 Binding energies (ΔE) and free-energy changes (ΔG) were
calculated for complexes of 1, 2, 3, and 4 with the seven different anionic analytes
considered herein with the following equations 1   2  where E and G refer to total energy and Gibbs free energy,
respectively. For reducing
the basis set superposition error (BSSE) in these energy terms, the
Boys–Bernardi scheme was used to offer the counterpoise corrected
energies.83
