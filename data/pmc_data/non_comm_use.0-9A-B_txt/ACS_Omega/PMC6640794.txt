A synergistic enhancement in oxygen
release/storage performance
was achieved with composites formed between CeO2 as an
oxygen gateway and La2O2SO4 as an
oxygen reservoir. CeO2 smoothly transfers oxygen atoms
between La2O2SO4 and the gas phase,
whereas La2O2SO4 stores a large amount
of oxygen. The composite materials exhibited enhanced anaerobic CO
oxidation and reversible oxygen storage in the presence of impregnated
Pt catalysts as compared to their individual constituents (Pt/CeO2 and Pt/La2O2SO4). In situ
X-ray diffraction and Raman experiments demonstrated that CeO2 significantly accelerated the redox reaction between La2O2SO4 (S6+) and La2O2S (S2–), while preserving its structure.
The reaction between CO and
CeO2/18O-labeled La2O2SO4 composites suggested that CO mainly reacted with the
lattice oxygen atoms of CeO2, and the resulting oxygen
vacancies were subsequently filled with oxygen atoms supplied by La2O2SO4. This oxygen gateway effect of
CeO2 greatly enhanced the oxygen release/storage rates
of La2O2SO4, while maintaining the
high oxygen storage capacity, which is an advanced feature of oxysulfate
materials. The synergistic effect is mostly pronounced when the two
different oxygen storage materials are in intimate contact to form
a three-phase boundary.

1 Introduction
Oxygen
storage materials are important in current automotive emission
control catalysts.1−7 These materials function as oxygen storage or releasing materials
in autoexhausts to achieve the ideal air-to-fuel ratio required for
complete conversion of noxious pollutants, including NOx, CO, and hydrocarbons over noble metal catalysts
(Pt, Rh, and/or Pd). Cerium-based binary oxides have been most widely
used for this purpose and CeO2–ZrO2 is
most widely used in practical applications.8−20 The redox reaction between Ce4+ and Ce3+ enables
fast oxygen transfer but limits the total oxygen storage capacity
(OSC) to less than 0.25 mol-O2 mol–1.
On the other hand, we reported an 8-fold increase in OSC values (2
mol-O2 mol–1) using lanthanum oxysulfates
(La2O2SO4), which utilize sulfur
as the redox center instead of metallic cations according to the following
reaction:21−27 La2O2SO4 ↔ La2O2S + 2O2. Their potential use has been studied
in other applications such as water–gas shift reaction catalysts,28 solid oxide fuel cells,29 and batteries.30 Even though oxysulfates
exhibit the largest reported OSC values, they have drawbacks owing
to their lower oxygen release rates and consequently higher operation
temperatures are required (≥600 °C) than those needed
for CeO2–ZrO2 (300–400 °C).
To overcome this, much research efforts have been directed toward
the microstructural and chemical modifications of materials by means
of methods such as soft-chemical synthesis using a surfactant-templating
method,23 impregnation of noble metals
such as Pt and Pd,25 complete replacement
of La by Pr (Pr2O2SO4),24 and partial replacement of La by Ce ((La1–xCex)2O2SO4).26 However, further
modifications are still needed to address the fundamental issue for
enabling lower operation temperatures, which may extend possible applications
of the oxysulfate materials.

Recently, a new type of oxygen
storage material, composites comprising
CeO2 and other metal oxides, has been proposed.31−36 A typical example is CeO2-grafted Fe2O3, which comprises several CeO2 grains intimately
bound on the surface of Fe2O3 via Ce–O–Fe
interfacial linkage.36 Owing to its local
structure, oxygen release and storage rates superior to those of CeO2 and an OSC greater than that of Fe2O3 could be simultaneously achieved. CeO2 plays the role
of an oxygen gateway by accelerating the conversion between O2 and oxide ions and the transfer of oxide ions to/from Fe2O3 acting as an oxygen reservoir. CeO2 is therefore considered as an efficient catalyst for enhancing oxygen
releasing and storage properties in other materials. This concept
can be extended for designing new composite oxygen storage materials
consisting of CeO2 (as an oxygen gateway) and other oxygen
reservoirs. La2O2SO4 can be a good
candidate for this purpose as it can serve as an oxygen reservoir
owing to its higher OSC and lower oxygen release/storage rates than
those of CeO2.

In the present study, novel composites
consisting of two oxygen
storage materials CeO2 and La2O2SO4 are prepared using the wet-impregnation method to examine
the oxygen gateway effect of CeO2. Oxygen release/storage
performance is evaluated using anaerobic CO oxidation techniques under
cycled feed stream conditions at various temperatures. Because the
composite materials exhibit prominent synergistic effects in terms
of the oxygen release/storage rate and capacity, the relationship
between the structure and properties of the materials was studied
using in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and in situ Raman spectroscopy
under the performed reaction conditions. A possible mechanism for
the oxygen gateway effect of CeO2 is discussed on the basis
of the results obtained with anaerobic CO oxidation using isotope-labeled
La2O2SO4.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Structure of CeO2/La2O2SO4 Composites
The
XRD patterns
of as-prepared CeO2/La2O2SO4 composites exhibited much less intense peaks of CeO2 even
with the greatest loading of CeO2 (40 wt %) as compared
to those obtained for reference samples consisting of physical mixtures
of CeO2 and La2O2SO4 (Figure S1). Therefore, the phases present in
the composite materials were analyzed using Raman spectroscopy. Figure 1 shows the Raman
spectra of La2O2SO4 and CeO2/La2O2SO4 (20 wt % CeO2) in the region of four fundamental vibration modes corresponding
to the SO42– unit: the nondegenerate
symmetric stretching mode (ν1, 990 cm–1), the symmetric bending mode of SO4 (ν2, 420 cm–1), the triply degenerate asymmetric stretching
mode (ν3, 1060–1180 cm–1), and the triply degenerate asymmetric bending mode of SO4 (ν4, 595–655 cm–1).37−39 Other bands observed in the 250–450 cm–1 region are assigned to the La–O fundamental modes.40 These bands are observed in the CeO2/La2O2SO4 composite, and a strong
band appears at approximately 460 cm–1, which is
assigned to the characteristic F2g mode of CeO2 corresponding to the symmetrical stretching mode of the CeO8 vibrational unit in the cubic fluorite structure.41,42 The Ce K edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) (Figure S2 and Table S1) analysis suggested that
Ce in the as-prepared CeO2/La2O2SO4 composites was present in a local environment similar to
that in CeO2; however, particles sizes of CeO2 were smaller in the composite than those in the individual sample.
The structural characterization results can be rationalized by considering
the presence of highly dispersed CeO2 in the composite
samples. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area
of the as-prepared CeO2/La2O2SO4 composites was ∼10 m2 g–1 regardless of CeO2 loading (5–40 wt %).

2.2 Oxygen
Release/Storage of Pt/CeO2/La2O2SO4 Composites
The
oxygen release/storage performance of Pt-loaded composite materials
was evaluated on the basis of the CO/O2 cycle reactions
and by comparing the results with those obtained with the individual
constituents (Pt/CeO2 and Pt/La2O2SO4). Figure 2 illustrates the typical gas concentration profiles obtained
at the inlet and outlet of the flow reactor when the two gas feeds,
1% CO/He (10 min) and 0.5% O2/He (20 min), are alternately
switched. Over Pt/CeO2 at 500 °C (Figure 2a), the O2-to-CO
switch results in the appearance of a temporal CO2 peak
along with the simultaneous consumption of CO, suggesting CO oxidation
by the lattice oxygen atoms of CeO2. The concentration
of CO is then gradually increased to the initial value after 10 min.
Subsequent CO-to-O2 switch results in O2 uptake
owing to the oxidation of partially reduced CeO2 and the
appearance of another temporal CO2 peak owing to the desorption
of carbonate species formed on the surface of CeO2. The
cumulative amount of O2 uptake is equivalent to the amount
of CO consumed in anaerobic oxidation, corresponding to an apparent
OSC of 0.134 mmol-O2 g–1. The stoichiometric
CO oxidation and oxygen storage can be stably cycled at temperatures
of 400–700 °C. When Pt-unloaded sample was used, very
small CO conversion rates and OSC values were obtained, indicating
that Pt provides a number of active sites for CO oxidation and O2 dissociation and accelerates oxygen release/storage. When
the same cycle reaction is performed with Pt/La2O2SO4, a smaller conversion from CO to CO2 takes
place after the O2-to-CO switch (Figure 2b). The obtained OSC (0.030 mmol-O2 g–1) is smaller than that of Pt/CeO2, as higher temperatures (≥600 °C) are required for achieving
fast oxygen release/storage cycles of La2O2SO4.25,26 Nevertheless, a much higher OSC is obtained
for the Pt/CeO2/La2O2SO4 composite (20 wt % CeO2) as shown in Figure 2c. The initial CO conversion
obtained at the O2-to-CO switch with the composite is higher
than that of Pt/CeO2 and the conversion continues for a
longer time. A subsequent CO-to-O2 switch results in O2 storage because of the O2 breakthrough time of
more than 5 min. Accordingly, OSC calculated from the oxygen breakthrough
curve exhibits a much larger value (0.242 mmol-O2 g–1), which is a more than 8-fold greater value than
that obtained for Pt/La2O2SO4. According
to previous studies,21,22 oxygen release/storage reactions
for La2O2SO4 can be written as follows,
and the maximum OSC should be 4.92 mmol-O2 g–1 that corresponds to 2 mol-O2 (mol-S)−1. 1   2  It should be noted that the observed OSC values
are significantly lower than the maximum achievable OSC because the
anaerobic CO oxidation in Figure 2 is not completed within 10 min of the CO supply.

Figure 2 Influent
and effluent gas profiles measured during CO/O2 cycle reactions
over (a) Pt/CeO2, (b) Pt/La2O2SO4, and (c) Pt/CeO2/La2O2SO4 (40 wt % CeO2) under cycled
feed stream conditions of 0.5% O2 or 1% CO at 500 °C. W/F = 4 × 10–3 g
min cm–3.

From the reaction profiles obtained at different temperatures,
the OSC values (OSCobs) of Pt/CeO2/La2O2SO4 are calculated (Figure 3). The weighted sum calculated from the weight
fraction and OSC of individual constituents (Pt/CeO2 and
Pt/La2O2SO4) is also given (denoted
as OSCcalc). The OSCcalc values obtained at
the lowest temperature of 400 °C might imply a larger contribution
from Pt/CeO2, in contrast to the negligible contribution
from Pt/La2O2SO4. However, Pt/La2O2SO4 exhibits significantly enhanced
OSC values at temperatures equal to or higher than 600 °C, whereas
the OSC of Pt/CeO2 is found to be less dependent on the
temperature. Notably, Pt/CeO2/La2O2SO4 exhibits much higher OSCobs values than
OSCcalc values (obtained at any temperature). This shows
that the composite exhibits higher OSCs than those obtained with the
individual constituents, clearly indicating the synergistic effect
achieved by combining two oxygen storage materials exhibiting different
characteristics. The difference between the OSCobs and
OSCcalc values is more obvious at low reaction temperatures
and high CeO2 loading. The enhancement in OSC is found
to depend on the microstructure of the composites as indicated in Figure 4. As compared to
the physical mixture of Pt/CeO2 and Pt/La2O2SO4, the two composites, prepared by impregnating
Pt onto La2O2SO4 followed by Ce impregnation
or by impregnating Ce onto La2O2SO4 followed by Pt impregnation, exhibit more than 2-fold greater OSC
values even though the samples have the same chemical composition.
This demonstrates that the extent of interface contact between CeO2 and La2O2SO4 plays a key
role in enhancing oxygen release/storage performance.

OSCcalc values for Pt/CeO2/La2O2SO4 at different temperatures

from OSCobs values for Pt/CeO2 and Pt/La2O2SO4.

Figure 4 OSC values for CeO2/Pt/La2O2SO4 and Pt/CeO2/La2O2SO4 composites and a physical mixture at 500 °C (20 wt %
CeO2).

The maximum OSC obtained
was determined using a flow microbalance
when reducing (1.4% H2/He) and oxidizing (0.7% O2/He) gas feeds were cycled at 600 °C (Figure 5). Pt/CeO2 exhibits small weight
oscillations (OSC < 0.1 mmol-O2 g–1) as oxygen release/storage is limited near the surface region. Pt/La2O2SO4 exhibits larger weight changes
(0.45 mmol-O2 g–1), close to 10% of the
theoretical OSC estimated from stoichiometric reactions (eqs 1 and 2),
which can be attributed to the slow reaction rates obtained at this
temperature. In contrast, Pt/CeO2/La2O2SO4 (20 wt % CeO2) exhibits fast and large
weight changes (3.12 mmol-O2 g–1) corresponding
to >70% of the stoichiometric reactions. The oxygen release and
storage
rates are estimated from the initial slope of the weight change shown
in Figure 5 (Table 1). The oxygen release
rates obtained with the composite are more than 9-fold faster than
those of La2O2SO4. Similarly, the
composite exhibits a faster oxygen storage rate (>6-fold) than
La2O2SO4. Both samples exhibit higher
oxygen
storage rates than oxygen release rates. In Figure 5, the weight oscillation curves a and b show
a slow decay with time, whereas the S/La molar ratio remained unchanged
during the oxygen release/storage cycles. A possible reason for the
decay is because of the carbonaceous residue removed under O2 atmosphere, which originates from an organic templating molecule
(SDS).

2.3 Structural Change during
Oxygen Release/Storage
Phase changes during oxygen release
obtained in a flow of 5% H2/N2 and subsequent
oxygen storage in 5% O2/N2 were analyzed using
in situ XRD. Figure 6a shows a comparison of the
XRD patterns of Pt/La2O2SO4 and Pt/CeO2/La2O2SO4 (20 wt % CeO2) recorded at 5 min intervals after starting the 5% H2/N2 gas feed at 600 °C. In the case of CeO2-unloaded Pt/La2O2SO4, the
La2O2SO4 phase gradually disappears
within the initial 70 min, accompanied by the simultaneous formation
of La2O2S. In contrast, with the Pt/CeO2/La2O2SO4 composite, faster
phase transformation from La2O2SO4 to La2O2S is obtained, which is almost complete
in 30 min. According to the following oxygen storage performed at
the same temperature in a stream of 5% O2/N2 (Figure 6b), the
oxidation of La2O2S in both the samples is completed
in 10 min; however, the composite exhibits a faster reaction than
the La2O2SO4 sample. These results
clearly demonstrate the promoting effect of CeO2 not only
on the reduction of La2O2SO4 but
also on the oxidation of La2O2S.

Figure 6 In situ XRD patterns
of Pt/La2O2SO4 and Pt/CeO2/La2O2SO4 (20 wt % CeO2) during (a) reduction in 5% H2/N2 at 600 °C
and (b) subsequent reoxidation in 5%
O2/N2 at 600 °C. The XRD patterns were
acquired every 5 min after starting each gas feed.

Because the structural change of CeO2 occurring during
reduction/oxidation could not be detected with in situ XRD, in situ
Raman spectroscopy was used to analyze the redox behavior of the composite.
The Raman spectrum is surface-sensitive and is reflected by the structural
changes of CeO2. Figure 7 shows the Raman spectra recorded at 30 s intervals
during cycled redox feed streams of 5% H2/N2 and 5% O2/N2 at 500 °C. During the reduction,
bands corresponding to the ν1 (990 cm–1) and ν2 (420 cm–1) modes of [SO4] disappear (Figure 7a). Even though a slight weakening of the CeO2 F2g band at 440 cm–1 is observed, it remains
even after the [SO4] bands disappear. As reported in our
previous paper,36 the CeO2 F2g band weakened under a H2 atmosphere at 500 °C
because oxygen release from the CeO2 lattice caused an
increase in the concentration of oxygen vacancies near the surface,
resulting in the disordered distribution of oxygen vacancies. The
F2g band is reversibly restored by the successive admission
of O2, indicating the filling of oxygen vacancies with
rapid O2 uptake. A similar trend is observed in the present
system when reduction and oxidation take place. The oxidation step
(Figure 7b) initially
leads to the temporal appearance of a strong band at ∼380 cm–1, which cannot be assigned at this stage. However,
it may be associated with the structural change of the [La2O2] unit occurring at the initial stage of oxidation from
La2O2S to La2O2SO4 because a similar phenomenon is observed with CeO2-unloaded Pt/La2O2SO4. The F2g band (440 cm–1) intensifies before the
ν1 band (990 cm–1) appears, indicating
that the oxygen storage of CeO2 is completed before the
oxidation of La2O2S begins. Thus, when loaded
onto the La2O2SO4 surface, CeO2 in the composite is assumed to lose lattice oxygen atoms
to some extent during oxygen release, while still preserving its structure.
The oxygen deficiency should be limited near the surface regions because
the Ce K edge EXAFS measurements suggest that the atomic distances
and coordination numbers for Ce–O and Ce–O–Ce
spheres are negligibly affected by the oxygen release occurring during
anaerobic CO oxidation (Figure S2 and Table S1). The efficient effect of CeO2 on the redox reaction
between La2O2SO4 and La2O2S should be associated with the oxygen transfer at the
three-phase boundary among CeO2, La2O2SO4/La2O2S, and the gas phase.

subsequent reoxidation in 5% O2/N2 at 500 °C.
The gas feed was switched from N2 to each gas at 0 s.

2.4 Possible
Mechanism of Enhanced Oxygen Release/Storage
To elucidate
the possible mechanism for enhanced oxygen release/storage,
anaerobic CO oxidation was performed over 18O-labeled La2O2SO4, which was prepared by the reaction
between La2O2S (Pt-loaded) and 18O2 at 600 °C. In a flow system, 18O2 pulse injection to a single phase La2O2S was repeated in a He stream (Figure S3). The occurrence of cumulative oxygen uptake corresponding to the
stoichiometric oxidation to form La2O2SO4 was confirmed. The as-prepared 18O-labeled La2O2SO4 sample was characterized using
Raman spectroscopy (Figure 8). The bands corresponding to the four fundamental vibrations
of the SO4 unit of La2O2SO4 broaden and shift to lower frequencies upon 18O-exchange
(Figure 8a,b). To confirm
that these changes are associated with isotopic shifts owing to the
presence of SO4 units containing different numbers of 18O, the strongest singlet ν1 mode band is
deconvoluted (Figure 8c). The band can be split into five peak components assigned to S16O4, S16O318O,
S16O218O2, S16O18O3, and S18O4. By
examining the integrated peak intensities obtained for each peak component,
the isotopic fraction [18O]/([16O] + [18O]) of the SO4 unit was calculated to be ∼66%.
Thus, the isotopic oxygen distribution in the sample can be expressed
as La2(16O0.3218O0.68)2S(16O0.3418O0.66)4. Because the oxysulfate crystal structure
is formed with alternately stacked layers of [La2O2]2+ and [SO4]2–, the
similar isotopic fractions observed in each structure unit suggest
the occurrence of a fast isotope scrambling in the solid phase. The
presence of 18O in the [La2O2]2+ unit can be associated with isotopic shifts of the bands
observed in the range of 250–450 cm–1, which
are assigned to the La–O fundamental modes.

La2O2SO4 and
(b) 18O-labeled La2O2SO4 showing four fundamental S–O vibration modes. (c) Fitting
results obtained for the ν1 vibration mode of 18O-labeled La2O2SO4.

By impregnating Ce onto as-prepared 18O-labeled La2O2SO4, CeO2/Pt/La2O2SO4 composites were
prepared to perform anaerobic
CO oxidation using the pulse injection method at 600 °C. As shown
in Figure 4, two composites
prepared by using different sequences of impregnation of Ce and Pt
onto La2O2SO4 exhibit similar OSC
values. Therefore, this sample can be used for analyzing the anaerobic
CO oxidation mechanism. Figure 9 shows a plot of isotopic oxygen fraction in CO2 versus the number of CO pulses at 600 °C. When 18O-labeled La2O2SO4 (Pt-loaded) is
used alone, the initial isotopic oxygen fraction in CO2 (37%) is close to half the aforementioned 18O fraction
of the SO4 unit (66%). This is explained by considering
the following reaction 3  The isotopic oxygen fraction in CO2 monotonically decreases
with an increase in the number of CO pulses,
as the oxygen scrambling between pulsed CO and the SO4 unit
decreases the concentration of 18O in La2O2SO4. Notably, quite different behavior was observed
with the CeO2/Pt/La2O2SO4 composites; the isotopic oxygen fraction in CO2 is initially
less than 10%, which gradually increases with an increase in the number
of CO pulses. This trend is more obvious at greater CeO2 loadings, although the isotopic oxygen fractions of these different
samples are almost the same after 25 times of CO pulse injections.
These results indicate that injected CO is oxidized by the lattice
oxygen atoms of CeO2 and the resulting oxygen vacancies
in CeO2 are filled with oxygen atoms diffused from the 18O-labeled La2O2SO4. With
an increase in CO pulse injection numbers, the lattice oxygen of CeO2 is further replaced by oxygen atoms transferred from La2O2SO4, which is increasingly converted
into La2O2S. We could not identify the presence
of 18O in CeO2 from Raman spectra because the
isotopic shift of the CeO2 F2g mode was small
(less than 20 cm–1)43 and the isotopic concentration in CeO2 was low.

fractions in CO2 produced by CO reaction
with samples containing 18O-labeled La2O2SO4 at 600 °C.

On the basis of the analysis results obtained and the enhancement
in oxygen release/storage performance, possible reaction schemes for
oxygen transfer at the three-phase boundary including the CeO2/La2O2SO4 interface are proposed
(depicted in Figure 10). In the present study, the 1 wt % Pt-supported samples were used
for the oxygen release/storage experiments. Although Pt plays a key
role in the activation of O2 and reducing agents (CO and
H2), the present study focuses on the oxygen gateway effect
of CeO2 on La2O2SO4. Under
a reducing atmosphere, the surface oxygen of CeO2 (Os) is readily removed by a reducing agent, such as CO and H2, yielding an oxygen vacancy (VO) (i–ii).
As the number of oxygen vacancies increases to a certain value, VO is immediately filled with oxygen atoms supplied by La2O2SO4 (iii). Because of the greater
OSC values of La2O2SO4, fast oxygen
release can occur (maximum value of 2 mol-O2 (mol-S)−1). As the O2 pressure in the gas phase
increases, reverse oxygen transfer occurs. Thus, O2 dissociated
on the CeO2 surface is smoothly transferred to oxidize
La2O2S to La2O2SO4 (iv–vi). This mechanism might explain the enhancement
in OSC and the reaction rate of the CeO2/La2O2SO4 composite. The role of CeO2 in the composite material is similar to that in the CeO2-grafted Fe2O3 examined in our previous study.36 The combination of CeO2 (as an oxygen
gateway) and Fe2O3 (as an oxygen reservoir)
yields a noticeable synergistic effect on oxygen release and storage.
Regardless of the limited OSC (<0.25 mol-O2 mol–1) that is attributed to the redox reaction between
Ce3+ and Ce4+, the unique ability of CeO2 in promoting rapid oxygen transfer between another solid
and gas phase can be widely extendable for producing various composite
materials exhibiting oxygen release/storage phenomena. Finally, although
this is beyond the scope of this paper, it is interesting to note
that the precise control of spatial distribution of Pt, CeO2, and La2O2SO4 is essential for
the oxygen release/storage performance because the extent of contacts
between these three components influences the final redox response
of the present ternary systems (Figure 4). This issue should be especially important to reduce
the amount of Pt loading and will be a common target for future studies.

3 Experimental Section
3.1 Sample
Preparation
La2O2SO4 was
synthesized via a template route
as reported previously.23 La(NO3)3 (99.9%, Mitsuwa Chemical), C12H25OSO3Na (SDS, 98.5%; Kishida Chemical), aqueous ammonia,
and deionized water with a molar ratio of La/SDS/NH3/H2O = 1:2:30:60 were mixed at 40 °C for 1 h followed by
stirring at 60 °C for more than 10 h. The mixture was then cooled
to room temperature to obtain a precipitate at pH 11. The precipitate
was collected by centrifugal separation, washed thoroughly with ion-exchanged
distilled water, dried by evacuation at room temperature, and finally
heated at 600 °C for 5 h in air to obtain La2O2SO4. CeO2/La2O2SO4 composites (5–40 wt % loading as CeO2) were prepared by impregnating an aqueous solution of Ce(NO3)3 (99.9%, Mitsuwa Chemical) onto as-prepared La2O2SO4 followed by calcination at 500
°C for 2 h in air. The as-calcined samples were impregnated with
an aqueous solution of H2PtCl6 and then calcined
at 500 °C for 5 h to produce Pt-loaded samples (1 wt % loading
as Pt). Another type of composite material was prepared by means of
the reverse sequence of impregnation, in which Pt was first supported
on La2O2SO4 followed by impregnation
of Ce. The as-prepared composite materials thus obtained are denoted
as Pt/CeO2/La2O2SO4 and
CeO2/Pt/La2O2SO4. In addition,
a physical mixture of Pt/CeO2 and Pt/La2O2SO4 was prepared for use as a reference sample.

Isotopic oxygen (18O)-labeled La2O2SO4 was prepared by the direct reaction between La2O2S and 18O2. Initially,
Pt-loaded La2O2SO4 (1 wt % Pt) was
completely reduced to La2O2S in flowing H2 at 700 °C. After evacuation, the product was placed
in He flow at 600 °C, and a pulse injection of 18O2 (1.63 mL) into the gas feed was repeated until oxygen uptake
was complete. The isotopic oxygen concentration in the effluent gas
was measured using a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Omnistar; Pfeiffer)
to calculate the isotopic fraction of obtained La2O2SO4. A composite material CeO2/Pt/La2O2SO4 (20 wt % CeO2) was
prepared by impregnating Ce(NO3)3 onto 18O-labeled La2O2SO4 as described
above.

3.2 Characterization
The BET surface
area was calculated from the N2 adsorption isotherms measured
at −196 °C (Belsorp-mini; Microtrac-Bel). Energy-dispersive
X-ray fluorescence analysis (MESA-500 W; Horiba) was used to determine
the loading of CeO2, the S/La molar ratio, and the presence
of possible impurities for as-calcined samples. The concentration
of residual chlorine associated with the impregnated H2PtCl6 was below the detection limit. Powder XRD measurements
were carried out with a Rigaku Multiflex diffractometer using monochromated
Cu Kα radiation (40 kV, 20 mA). The structural changes observed
during the reduction and reoxidation stages were measured by means
of in situ XRD using a Rigaku RINT Ultima diffractometer (Cu Kα,
40 kV, 30 mA) equipped with a high-speed two-dimensional detector
D/teX-25. XRD patterns of the sample placed in a stream of 5% H2 or 5% O2 balanced with N2 (100 cm3 min–1) in a temperature-controllable chamber
were measured at constant intervals of 5 min with a scan rate of 40°
min–1. The high-speed detector enabled rapid scanning
of each XRD pattern within 60 s, which is short enough to neglect
the phase changes occurring during data acquisition.

The Ce
K edge EXAFS spectrum was recorded with an NW10A instrument of the
Photon Factory Advanced Ring for Pulse X-rays, High Energy Accelerator
Research Organization at Tsukuba using a ring energy of 6.5 GeV and
a stored current of around 35–60 mA. A Si(311) double-crystal
monochromator was used, and the spectra were recorded at room temperature
in the transmission mode. The EXAFS data were processed using a REX
2000 program (Rigaku). The EXAFS oscillation was extracted by fitting
a cubic spline function through the post-edge region. The k3-weighted EXAFS oscillation in the 3.0–14.0
Å–1 range was Fourier-transformed. Phase shifts
and backscattering amplitudes of Ce–O and Ce–O–Ce
were obtained from the EXAFS data of CeO2.

Raman
spectra were obtained with a Jasco NRS-3100 spectrometer
using a 532.1 nm laser as the excitation source. In situ Raman scattering
measurements were performed with a Horiba Jobin Yvon LabRAM HR Evolution
spectrometer using a 457 nm laser excitation source. The spectrometer
was connected to an infrared image heating stage (MS-TPS; Yonekura)
with a gas-flow system to perform high-temperature measurements under
controlled gas environments. The powder catalysts were heated at 500
°C under 5% O2/N2 flow to remove adsorbed
gases. This procedure was followed by flushing the samples with N2 for 30 s and subsequently reducing them in 5% H2/N2 for 10 min. At the end of the first reduction step,
N2 was flushed and 5% O2/N2 was subsequently
passed for 10 min. During the two sets of reduction/oxidation cycles,
Raman spectra were recorded every 30 s.

3.3 Oxygen
Release/Storage Measurement
The oxygen release/storage performance
of the Pt-loaded samples was
determined by anaerobic CO oxidation under cycled feed stream conditions
at constant reaction temperatures (400–700 °C) in a dual-supply
flow system. 1% CO/He and 0.5% O2/He gas feeds were alternately
switched at programmed time intervals (10 min for CO and 20 min for
O2). The gas feed rate (F = 50 cm3 min–1) to the sample (W = 0.20 g) was controlled at W/F = 4.0 × 10–3 g min cm–3. The concentrations of each gas component (CO, CO2, and
O2) before and after the catalyst bed were recorded using
a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Omnistar; Pfeiffer). Pulse-mode CO
oxidation was performed over CeO2/Pt/La2O2SO4, which was prepared from 18O-labeled
La2O2SO4 as described above. Measurements
were performed by placing the sample (0.1 g) in a stream of He at
600 °C and injecting a certain amount of CO (0.98 mL) repeatedly
into the stream just before the sample bed with monitoring of the
effluent gas composition using a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Omnistar;
Pfeiffer). The oxygen release/storage cycles were also examined using
a microbalance (8120; Rigaku) connected to a dual-gas supply system.
The sample was first heated in a He stream up to 600 °C, and
the weight was stabilized within 30 min. The gas feed to the sample
was then switched between 1.4% H2/He (120 min) and 0.7%
O2/He (40 min), while recording the sample weight.

4 Conclusions
Composite materials consisting of two different
oxygen storage
materials CeO2 and La2O2SO4 were prepared to examine their synergistic oxygen release and storage
performance using anaerobic CO oxidation in the presence of impregnated
Pt catalysts. The as-prepared CeO2/La2O2SO4 composite material achieved greater OSC and
higher reaction rates than those of its individual constituents in
a wide temperature range (400–700 °C). In situ XRD and
Raman spectroscopy experiments demonstrated that CeO2 significantly
accelerated the redox reaction between La2O2SO4 and La2O2S, while preserving
its structure. The reaction between CO and 18O-labeled
La2O2SO4 indicated that CO mainly
reacted with the lattice oxygen atoms of CeO2, and the
resulting oxygen vacancies were subsequently filled with oxygen atoms
supplied from the solid interface with La2O2SO4. Consequently, the synergistic effect can be rationalized
by considering that CeO2 acts as an oxygen gateway and
La2O2SO4 acts as an oxygen reservoir
when they are in intimate contact in a composite. The former activates
the dissociation of O2 to form oxide ions or the reaction
between oxide ions and reducing gases and transfers oxide ions to/from
La2O2SO4, whereas the latter enhances
OSC.
