Molecular
simulations have the potential to advance the understanding
of how the structure of organic materials can be engineered through
the choice of chemical components but are limited by computational
costs. The computational costs can be significantly lowered through
the use of modeling approximations that capture the relevant features
of a system, while lowering algorithmic complexity or by decreasing
the degrees of freedom that must be integrated. Such methods include
coarse-graining techniques, approximating long-range electrostatics
with short-range potentials, and the use of rigid bodies to replace
flexible bonded constraints between atoms. To understand whether and
to what degree these techniques can be leveraged to enhance the understanding
of planar organic molecules, we investigate the morphologies predicted
by molecular dynamic simulations using simplified molecular models
of perylene and perylothiophene. Approximately, 10 000 wall-clock
hours of graphics processing unit-accelerated simulations are performed
using both rigid and flexible models to test their efficiency and
predictive capability with the two chemistries. We characterize the
1191 resulting morphologies using simulated X-ray diffraction and
cluster analysis to distinguish structural transitions, summarized
by four phase diagrams. We find that the morphologies generated by
the rigid model of perylene and perylothiophene match with those generated
by the flexible model. We find that ordered, hexagonally packed columnar
phases are thermodynamically favored over a wide range of densities
and temperatures for both molecules, in qualitative agreement with
experiments. Furthermore, we find the rigid model to be more computationally
efficient for both molecules, providing more samples per second and
shorter times to equilibrium. Owing to the structural accuracy and
improved computational efficiency of modeling polyaromatic groups
as rigid bodies, we recommend this modeling choice for enhancing the
sampling in polyaromatic molecular simulations.

Introduction
Polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs) are an important class
of materials, not least because they can self-assemble into structures
that exhibit a long-range order.1 This
spontaneous ordering can be beneficial, as in the case of organic
electronic devices (particularly plastic solar cells), where ordering
maximizes the intermolecular charge transport between molecules, resulting
in high carrier mobilities and device efficiencies.2−7 Spontaneous aggregation of PAHs is detrimental to oil-extraction
operations, where the self-assembly of asphalting molecules leads
to the rapid precipitation of tarlike aggregates that foul heat exchangers
and limit crude oil processing.8−10 To control PAH aggregation, whether
for new organic electronic device design or to prevent fouling in
oil extraction, we require a fundamental understanding of PAH self-assembly
physics.

Elucidating links between PAH chemistry and self-assembled
morphologies
has been limited by the difficulties associated with measuring PAH
structure.11,12 Neutron scattering investigations
of PAHs in solution give insights into ensemble-averaged structural
features but come at the cost of requiring deuterated solvents or
samples and a neutron source.12 In the
solid state, X-ray diffraction (XRD) permits periodic features to
be probed, but residual solvents and amorphous samples can complicate
the analysis.11 Furthermore, constraints
of lab space, time, and raw material cost limit the number of PAH
chemistries and synthetic protocols that can be enumerated.

Computational models of molecular self-assembly are not subjected
to the same space, time, and material cost constraints of wet labs
and therefore permit broader explorations of large parameter spaces.
The self-assembly behavior of systems ranging from organic photovoltaic
mixtures,13,14 tethered nanoparticles,15 and copolymer melts16 has been
successfully investigated with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.
Previous computational work has elucidated fundamental entropic contributions
of particle shape on self-assembly17,18 and the transition
dynamics of reconfigurable colloidal clusters.19 The practical limitations to performing MD simulations
of every system of interest are the computational costs of relaxing
a system to equilibrium and the subsequent sampling of the equilibrium
ensemble of states. Consequently, it is essential that the molecular
models, computational algorithms, and computational hardware used
to perform MD simulations are optimized to minimize the computational
cost. Minimizing the computational cost is especially relevant for
high-throughput, “Big Data” screening studies wherein
thousands of simulations are performed, and a 10% improvement in efficiency
can save weeks of computing.20,21

The most detailed
classical MD simulations use atomistic models,
wherein interaction potentials that determine forces between atoms
are derived from quantum mechanical calculations or are fit to experimental
data to avoid solving wave equations explicitly. Atomistic simulations
have been successfully employed to investigate protein folding,22 fullerene solubility,23 asphaltene aggregation,10,24 and polymer structure25,26 for small number of molecules. By contrast, coarse-grained models
of molecules permit larger length and timescales to be accessed by
representing collections of atoms as simulation elements. These coarse-grained
simulations have been used to investigate morphology in organic photovoltaics,13,14 lipid bilayers,27 and protein structures.28 Even larger length scales can be accessed using
phase-field methods.29,30

With increased coarse graining
comes access to longer simulation
times and larger systems, at the cost of resolution that has been
abstracted away. For example, one commonly used coarse-graining scheme
is the united-atom model, where an explicit consideration of hydrogen
is omitted.31,32 Instead, the interactions between
heavier atoms are modulated to include the hydrogen interactions implicitly.
This is justified, as the hydrogen atoms themselves are expected to
have a negligible effect on the electronic and physical structure
of a system but add significant computational costs when calculating
neighbor interaction forces due to the presence of the large quantity
of hydrogen in typical organic systems. United-atom models have been
used in simulations to accurately predict the behavior of various
systems, including polymers,33 proteins,32 and other hydrocarbons,34−37 demonstrating no significant
structural differences between the united-atom and all-atom simulations
or experimental data. In particular, united-atom investigations have
shown good agreement with the structural and thermodynamic properties
predicted through experiments for a variety of PAHs.38

Another approximation technique arises from assuming
that the intramolecular positional fluctuations of
atoms within certain small molecules or functional
groups do not
significantly affect the long-range self-assembly characteristics.
As such, these groups of atoms can be assumed to belong to a rigid
body, where atoms are fixed in space with respect to their bonded
neighbors. This can dramatically reduce the computational overhead
of determining all of the bond, angle, and dihedral constraints within
the system, permitting significantly longer length and timescales
to be accessed.39 Rigid bodies are frequently
implemented in systems that investigate the morphology of nanoparticle
systems, using amphiphilic block copolymers40,41 or DNA42,43 to guide their self-assembly, and are shown
to accurately describe the experimentally observed structures. Studies
on more general “metaparticles” have shown that various
structural features that are relevant to organic materials can be
generated using rigid-body simulations.44 Rigid models have also been used to simulate aromatic hydrocarbons,
showing excellent agreement with experiments for a wide range of structural
properties and particle dynamics.45 Despite
the potential for rigid models to lower the computational cost of
simulating planar PAHs, systematic comparisons are lacking between
flexible and rigid models used across broad sets of state points and
molecular chemistries.

To describe the advances of the present
work in a clearer context,
we briefly summarize other, recent computational studies focusing
on polyaromatic molecules. Asphaltenes have polyaromatic cores similar
to the molecules studied here and require lengthy simulations of aggregate
structures at many thermodynamic state points to understand their
assembly physics. It is common to see simulations using the LINCS
algorithm to rigidly constrain bond lengths to help access longer
simulation times,46−48 but there are no examples of the rigid bodies described above to simplify the simulations of polyaromatic cores.
The longest simulations, with trajectories of ∼2000 ns, observe
the assembly of a dozen asphaltenes in water and methane under four
different conditions.49 Atomistic simulations
of 400 asphaltene molecules in vacuum access only 6 ns of simulation
time.50 Indeed, simulations that include
atomistic representations or explicit solvents generally access fewer
than 150 ns for fewer than 30 molecules.46,47,51−53 Wang and Ferguson used
coarse-grained models and GPU acceleration to access 500 ns trajectories
for 200 asphaltenes at 27 state points, demonstrating the sampling
advantages of simplified models and hardware accelerators.48 The work presented here extends the ideas of
Wang and Ferguson, demonstrating that rigid-body models, combined
with GPU accelerators can be used to efficiently sample thousands of thermodynamic state points, by equilibrating systems of 200 molecules
for over 100 ns each. A prior molecular simulation study on perylene
has investigated preassembled crystal structures,54 whereas here we observe for the first time the spontaneous
self-assembly of structures large enough, and with sufficient order,
to be directly compared against the experimental grazing-incidence
X-ray scattering (GIXS) data.

To study the self-assembly of
rigid organic molecules using high-throughput
simulation techniques, we require an understanding of which models
and methods are necessary and sufficient for predicting the experimentally
observed structures. Therefore, in this work, we perform united-atom
MD simulations to characterize rigid and flexible models of two types
of small molecules.

In this work, the PAHs perylene and perylo[1,12-bcd]thiophene (perylothiophene) are considered as test cases,
both owing
to their applicability to organic electronics3 and similarity to the cores of complex asphaltene molecules.55 We consider a “flexible” model,
in which the topological connectivities and geometries are enforced
by bond, angle, and dihedral constraints, and compare the computational
performance and the resultant packing morphologies with the rigid
model, when these constraints are fixed. The rigid model considerably
improves computational efficiency by permitting a larger quantity
of time steps to be accessed per second, without significantly increasing
the relaxation or autocorrelation timescales or affecting the obtained
morphologies. In the Methods section, we describe
the simulation methodology, along with details on the molecular topologies
and the analysis metrics we use. In the Results section, we discuss the thermodynamically stable morphologies predicted
with the two molecules and two models, demonstrating that experimentally
observed phase transitions are reproduced. Finally, we conclude by
considering the quantitative implications of modeling organic molecules
as rigid bodies, comparing our predictions with experimental measurements,
and highlighting opportunities for future work.

Methods
MD simulations
are performed to determine the thermodynamically
stable morphologies of perylene and perylothiophene as a function
of temperature and packing fraction for both rigid and flexible models.
Equilibration and sampling metrics are computed from time series of
potential energy and structural metrics. The structural metrics are
computed from the resulting morphologies to distinguish “vapor”,
“droplet”, “ordered”, and “eclipsed”
morphologies, which are summarized in phase diagrams.

MD Simulations
MD simulations are performed using the
HOOMD-blue simulation suite to predict the thermodynamically stable
morphologies for perylene and perylothiophene (Figure 1a,b, respectively).56−58 These are performed
in the canonical ensemble (constant number of molecules N, volume V, and temperature T),
using a Nosé–Hoover thermostat to control the temperature.59 Particle positions and velocities are updated
with two-step velocity-Verlet integration of Newton’s equations
of motion with a time step of dt = 0.001 dimensionless
time units.60 We run periodically bound
simulations of systems containing 200−1500 molecules until
the equilibrium is reached based on the stabilization and autocorrelation
of observables, including potential energy and structural crystallinity
order parameter (section S1). Each MD simulation
is initialized with a random, unique initial configuration except
for those at the lowest temperatures, which are initialized from the
final configuration of the next-highest temperature run with the same
density. After simulations have reached equilibrium, they are continued
until at least 20 statistically independent snapshots are obtained,
requiring on average 1.05 × 107 time steps in total.

Figure 1 Molecular
structures of (a) perylene and (b) perylothiophene. United-atom
topologies for (c) perylene and (d) perylothiophene. Blue spheres
represent C atoms (inner ring) or C−H beads (outer rings),
yellow spheres represent S atoms, and blue/yellow cylinders represent
bonds of the respective bead type. Arrows are drawn to indicate the
vectors that are used to describe the orientation of the molecules,
both in-plane and normal to the plane of the molecules.

The molecular topologies (atomic positions and
bond connectivities)
for perylene are constructed using Avogadro-1.1.1 (Figure 1c).61 The base units of length σ = 3.8 Å, mass M = 12.011 amu, and energy ϵ = 121.7 cal/mol (0.51 kJ/mol) are
taken from the optimized potentials for liquid simulations (OPLS)-UA
force field, where σ is the van der Waals radius and ϵ
is the depth of the Lennard-Jones potential modeling the pair-wise
interactions between aromatic carbons.32 The complete bond, angle, and dihedral force-field parameters are
tabulated in section S2, alongside a description
of the computational infrastructure used in this investigation. The
rigid-body constraints are implemented as described in Nguyen et al.39 Perylene simulations have time scale , and consequently, dt =
1.84 fs. The extensive work of Tsuzuki et al. has previously emphasized
the importance of electrostatic interactions in the packing of aromatic
molecules containing a thiophene moiety; however, electrostatic interactions
between the partial atomic charges of simulation elements are omitted
in this investigation.62 This is in the
interest of computational efficiency, as preliminary results have
shown that simulations run 3–4× more slowly when electrostatic
interactions are included, as described in section S3. In this work, we are primarily concerned in finding the
optimal compromise between accurately generating morphologies and
maximizing the number of computed simulation time steps per second
(TPS), and so, we do not consider the effects of partially charged
atoms on the system. To ascertain the effect of heteroatoms on molecular
packing, a sulfur atom is included in the coarse-grained perylene
model to simulate perylothiophene (Figure 1d), which is selected because of its viability
in organic photovoltaic devices3 and also
because of the importance of heteroatoms in asphaltene molecules.55

The OPLS-UA and TraPPE-UA force fields
are used to infer the Lennard-Jones
parameters: ϵs = 358 cal/mol (1.5 kJ/mol) and σs = 3.5 Å for the sulfur−sulfur interactions, and
ϵc = ϵs/3 for carbon−carbon.32,63 The mass of the sulfur atom is MS =
32.06 amu. Simulations of both perylene and perylothiophene are conducted
for a range of: 61.25 ≤ T ≤ 1837 K.
A range of densities are considered between 0.01 and 1.7 g/cm3, which includes experimentally observed solid densities of
1.286 and 1.483 g/cm3 for perylene and perylothiophene,
respectively.64,65Section S4 summarizes the range of temperatures and densities studied in this
work along with temperature and density steps.

Structural Analysis
Molecular packing is quantified
by four metrics: the center-of-mass radial distribution function g(r), orientational correlations among
neighboring molecules ξ, a degree-of-crystallinity metric ψ,
and with simulated GIXS characterization. The metrics g(r), ξ, and ψ are used in concert to
distinguish the vapor, droplet, ordered, and eclipsed phases. Simulated
GIXS patterns are used to identify periodic length scales and structural
symmetries and to compare simulated morphologies against experimentally
synthesized materials. These GIXS patterns are computed using numerical
Fourier techniques, as described in refs (13) and (66).

Calculating g(r) between molecular centers of mass provides data to justify molecular-clustering
criteria. Two key length scales are determined from g(r) of ordered morphologies, Rin,cut and Rout,cut, which are
used to distinguish the molecules that are nearest neighbors in a
“stack” and the molecules that are in neighboring stacks,
respectively. The in-stack cutoff distance Rin,cut = 5.0 Å is chosen as a clustering criterion based
on the location of the first minimum in g(r), following the nearest-neighbor peak at r = 3.5 Å (Figure 2a). The neighboring-stack cutoff distance Rout,cut = 11.6 Å is determined by the geometric average 1  of the nearest-neighbor peak (rπ = 5.0 Å) and the stack-center to stack-center
distance (rc = 10.5 Å) determined
from the third-nearest-neighbor peak of g(r) (Figure 2a).

with a solid line at g(r) = 1 as
a reference for a completely random system. Tvapor > Tdisordered > Tdroplet > Tordered. Lower
temperature simulations give rise to g(r) values that are more distinct than a randomly oriented system.
The dashed black line describes a disordered system that lies between
the droplet and vapor phases. Further analysis is needed to distinguish
the phase of this system; see text for details. (b) Clusters colored
blue, green, and red based on molecule distances and orientations,
for a representative ordered morphology of rigid perylene, performed
at T = 1290 K and ρ = 1.77 g/cm3.

The orientational order parameter
ξ is calculated for a simulation
snapshot by averaging the local orientational order 2  over all pairs of neighboring molecules,
where oi and oj are the unit orientation
vectors for molecules i and j whose
COM separation is less than Rin,cut.54 The in-plane
orientation vector o for perylene is defined to be
orthogonal to the bonds connecting naphthalene rings and is depicted
by a black arrow in Figure 1c. In perylothiophene, the direction of orientation vector o is defined from the center-of-mass of the perylene core
to the sulfur atom, as shown in Figure 1d. A system is considered eclipsed when ξ ≥
0.9. This cutoff is chosen based on the evolution of ξ as a
function of T at the densities studied here, which
shows that 0.9 is a sensitive cutoff distinguishing molecular stacks
that are in and out of register (section S5).

The crystallinity order parameter ψ is calculated
for a simulation
snapshot as the fraction of molecules in large “clusters”.
Here, two molecules i and j are
considered to be part of the same cluster when ri,j ≤ Rout,cut and when θi,j < θcut. The alignment of two
molecules θi,j is
calculated from the dot product of their out-of-plane unit vectors
(Figure 1c,d). θcut is determined from the distribution of the dot products
between the normal vectors of molecules (section S6). Clusters comprising 30% or more of the system (60+ molecules)
are considered “large”. This metric is chosen to distinguish
ordered morphologies containing a few large clusters, whereas droplet
and vapor configurations contain many small clusters. Figure 2b shows a configuration with
three clusters (colored blue, green, and red), identified using this
clustering protocol. The “large cluster” cutoff of 30%
is chosen to balance overcounting of small clusters against undercounting
large clusters, based on visual inspection using Visual Molecular
Dynamics.67,68

The gaseous vapor phase distinguished
here is characterized by
low molecular association (no defined peaks in g(r)), low orientational correlations ξ ≤ 0.9,
and low crystallinity ψ ≤ 0.5 as expected at low densities
and high temperatures. The liquid droplet phase is distinguished by
significant aggregation (first peak is the only defined peak in g(r)), with low orientational correlations
ξ ≤ 0.9 and low crystallinity ψ ≤ 0.5. At
high temperatures and pressures, these liquid and gaseous phases become
indistinguishable and so are characterized instead as a “fluid”
phase. The solid ordered phase is distinguished by well-defined first-,
second-, and third-nearest-neighbor peaks in g(r) (Figure 2a), low orientational correlations ξ ≤ 0.9, and high
crystallinity ψ ≤ 0.5. In this work, ordered phases are
characterized by hexagonally packed columns of molecules (Figure 3), demonstrating
significant π-stacking (Figure 2b). The eclipsed phase shares the g(r) peak structure of the ordered phase but has
high orientational correlations ξ ≥ 0.9 and high crystallinity
ψ ≥ 0.5. As in the ordered phase, π-stacking is
prevalent in the eclipsed phase but differs in that molecules in a
stack share the same orientation.

the page, characteristic
of ordered morphologies of (a) perylene and (b) perylothiophene with
zoomed-in regions (c) and (d). Carbon atoms are represented with blue
spheres and sulfur with yellow.

At low densities (≤0.65 g/cm3), we consider
an
additional criterion to distinguish vapor and droplet phases. Here,
average g(r) values in the range
of 9.3 ≤ r < 10.9 Å (gray highlight
in Figure 1a) are compared
with those present in the highest temperature, most dispersed system.
This range is chosen to allow long-range order comparisons between
simulations, without taking into account the short-range π-stacking
present in all samples. If the average g(9.3 ≤ r < 10.9) for the lower temperature sample is within
10% of that for the highest temperature, most dispersed trial, then
the system is considered to be a vapor. An example of this characterization
methodology is shown in Figure 2a. Here, for 9.3 ≤ r < 10.9 Å,
the 1163 K system (black dashed line) is within 10% of the 1837 K
system (green line), representing the vapor system, and so, the 1163
K system is also considered to be a vapor. At lower temperatures,
the 918 K system (blue line) is shown to be more than 10% of g(r) of the vapor, and so, this morphology
more closely represents a droplet. As the temperature decreases further
(red line, 612 K), the morphology is significantly more ordered than
the vapor phase, and the g(r) peaks
become even more defined. Thus, g(r) is used to determine the phase transition temperatures from strongly
ordered to droplet to vapor.

Using these criteria to distinguish
the structures resulting from
the MD simulations, phase diagrams are constructed for flexible and
rigid perylene and for flexible and rigid perylothiophene. Note that
the transition temperatures indicated on phase diagrams presented
here are approximations whose utility is derived from their low cost
to generate. For more accurate phase coexistence curves, Gibbs ensemble
simulation techniques are more appropriate.69

Results
Initial simulation results demonstrate no differences
in structural
metrics ψ, ξ, and g(r) for systems of 200–1500 molecules (section S7). Owing to the significantly faster relaxation times and
simulation times, we therefore focus on systems of 200 molecules and
report the results in this section. Systems of 200 molecules require
on average 20 ns of simulation time to reach equilibrium, followed
by on average 115 ns of sampling time. Potential energy and ψ
autocorrelation times are calculated to ensure at least 20 uncorrelated
snapshots are generated during the sampling period. If fewer than
20 independent snapshots are generated, simulations are run longer
until this criterion is satisfied.

Phase Diagrams
Using g(r), ξ, and ψ to differentiate morphologies
resulting from
our MD simulations, we summarize how the assembled morphologies of
perylene and perylothiophene depend on temperature, density, and model
flexibility in four phase diagrams (Figure 4). Each phase diagram is divided into five
regions: vapor (green), fluid (cyan), droplet (blue), ordered (red),
and eclipsed (magenta). At high temperatures (T >
1700 K), vapor phases are observed at low densities and fluid phases
at high densities. All four phase diagrams show a phase boundary between
fluid phases and ordered phases at higher densities (ρ >
0.65)
g/cm3, although the disordered–ordered transition
temperatures TDO vary. Another common
feature is the phase boundary between the ordered and eclipsed phases
at lower temperatures across the full range of densities studied.
Finally, all four phase diagrams indicate regions of phase space with
droplets located between the ordered and vapor phases at low densities
(ρ ≤ 0.65) g/cm3. At densities greater than
0.65 g/cm3, the droplet and vapor phases are indistinguishable.

Figure 4 Phase
diagrams of (a) flexible perylene, (b) rigid perylene, (c)
flexible perylothiophene, and (d) rigid perylothiophene. Regions are
colored to describe phases of decreasing order as explained in the
text, where magenta describes eclipsed columns, red describes ordered
π-stacked columns, blue describes droplets, green describes
vapors, and cyan describes a disordered fluid phase. Each black “x”
represents a state point calculated in this investigation.

We find that the phase diagrams for rigid models
of perylene and
perylothiophene are similar to their flexible counterparts. For perylene,
the phase boundaries between the droplet phase and the vapor, fluid,
and ordered phases are nearly identical with both models. The phase
boundary between fluid and ordered phases is also similar between
rigid and flexible perylene, although we observe significantly higher TDO for the rigid model at high densities (ρ
> 1.5 g/cm3). The transition temperatures between ordered
perylene and eclipsed perylene also slightly shift higher for the
rigid model relative to the flexible model (and more so at ρ
= 1.77 g/cm3) but generally are within 90 K of each other.
For perylothiophene, the rigid and flexible phase diagrams are nearly
identical. As with perylene, there is a shift in TDO observed at high densities. At low densities, we observe
discrepancies between the rigid and flexible phase boundaries between
the droplet, vapor, and ordered phases.

The phase diagrams for
perylene and perylothiophene are qualitatively
similar in that they each contain the same five phases arranged similarly.
One difference is that the phase boundaries between ordered and fluid/vapor
phases of perylothiophene occur at higher temperatures than those
observed for perylene. Additionally, the phase boundary between the
ordered and eclipsed phases for perylothiophene is at lower temperatures
than that observed for perylene. This demonstrates that the addition
of a single heteroatom (the difference between perylothiophene and
perylene) is enough to significantly broaden the thermodynamic stability
of an ordered morphology (here, hexagonally packed cylinders) over
a wide region of state space.

Overall, we find that the rigid
models of perylene and perylothiophene
give comparable structural results to their flexible counterparts.
The discrepancy between rigid and flexible models at high densities
is not surprising. At high densities, flexible molecules can compress
to relieve stresses imposed by the crowded molecules nearby, whereas
rigid molecules cannot. This observation is consistent with entropic
considerations (which depend sensitively on degree-of-freedom constraints),
determining the phase behavior of densely packed shapes.18,70 The densities at which the rigid model differs substantially from
the flexible model are significantly higher than experimentally observed
densities for these molecules. We therefore conclude that rigid models
of perylene and perylothiophene give comparable structural results
to their flexible model counterparts and are appropriate for mapping
out the phase space.

This is further justified by the correspondence
between our simulated
perylene transition temperatures and those from experiments. In an
investigation by Botoshansky, Herbstein, and Kapon, the phase boundary
between melted perylene and crystalline α-perylene was found
at ≈600 K, and the phase boundary between α-perylene
and β-perylene was found at ≈450 K.71 These temperatures agree well with the ≈600 and
≈400 K phase boundaries between fluid/ordered and ordered/eclipsed
phases observed in this work at experimental densities (1.28 g/cm3).

Molecular Packings
In the ordered
phase, rigid and
flexible models of perylene and perylothiophene self-assemble hexagonally
packed columns (Figure 3a,b), at temperatures near 600 K. The center-of-mass radial distribution
function g(r) shows nearly identical
structural correlations among these four models, with flexible perylene
demonstrating slightly different ordering length scales (Figure 5). For these ordered
structures, shown in Figure 3a,b, the first g(r) peak
corresponds to π-stacking and is located at 3.50 Å in flexible
perylene. We measure π-stacking distance for both models of
perylothiophene and the rigid model of perylene to be 3.44 Å.
We therefore conclude that the rigid model faithfully reproduces the
major packing features of its flexible counterpart for perylene and
perylothiophene, with no g(r) peak
varying more than 0.1 Å between the two models.

and perylothiophene. Flexible perylene (F-Pe) is represented with
a blue line, rigid perylene (R-Pe) with a cyan line, flexible (F-Pt)

Perylene Morphologies
At temperatures below the disorder–order
transition temperature TDO, we observe
perylene systems with ρ > 0.85 g/cm3 self-assembling
into ordered morphologies. We observe a second phase transition between
ordered and eclipsed morphologies at even lower temperatures. The
ordered morphologies are characterized by stacks of perylene molecules
arranged hexagonally, as shown in Figure 3. The stacks of molecules in ordered morphologies
have no orientational correlations along the stacking axis. In eclipsed
morphologies, all of the perylenes in a stack have identical orientations,
as shown in Figure 6. Furthermore, we observe that the orientationally ordered stacks
in eclipsed morphologies can aggregate in both checkerboard (Figure 6a) and aligned (Figure 6b) motifs. In the
checkerboard case, adjacent stacks have orientation offset by 90°.
In the aligned case, adjacent stacks have identical orientations.
The potential energy of the checkerboard motif (−275.13 ±
0.17ϵ) is slightly lower, but very close to that of the aligned
motif (−275.95 ± 0.17ϵ) (section S8).

runs for both rigid and flexible perylene. These are colored red and

there exists a small, differently oriented crystal that is colored

Simulated GIXS patterns of ordered and eclipsed morphologies
(Figure 7a) are qualitatively
similar to experimental GIXS patterns of β-perylene crystals
(Figure 7b, adapted
with permission from Ishii and Miyasaka).72 We observe in-plane reflections (labeled 110 in Figure 7b) which correspond to π-stacking
and out-of-plane reflections (labeled 001 in Figure 7b), corresponding to columnar packings. We
do not observe (111̅) and (120) peaks, corresponding to the
glide planes that describe the symmetry between columns in our simulated
GIXS patterns. We find, using both GIXS and g(r) analyses, a π-stacking distance of 3.4 Å,
which is in good agreement with 3.47 Å found in α-perylene.73,74

and eclipsed perylene morphologies
observed here differ from the experimentally observed α and
β polymorphs of perylene.73−75 The herringbone arrangements
observed in α and β perylene are not observed in our simulations
and are the primary structural difference. Lattice parameters for
β-perylene have been measured experimentally as: a = 9.76, b = 5.84, and c = 10.61
Å.76,77 We calculate the lattice parameters for
aligned, eclipsed morphologies to be: a = 7.36, b = 3.33, and c = 9.12 Å. The parameter b is significantly smaller in the simulated morphologies,
as the perylene stacks are orthogonal to the b axis
in this investigation, instead of the flattened-out herringbone/γ-structure
often observed experimentally in the β phase.78 For the checkerboard, eclipsed morphologies, we calculate
lattice parameters: a = 11.46, b = 3.33, and c = 16.22 Å, which are further
from β-perylene parameters than the aligned, eclipsed morphologies.
Scattering patterns for the two structures are also shown in Figure 6e,f with the corresponding
morphologies in (c) and (d). The scattering patterns shown in Figure 6e,f are similar to
that of the β-perylene structure shown in Figure 7b, wherein we observe reflections owing to
π-stacking and columnar formations.

It is not surprising
that the rigid and flexible models of perylene
studied here do not perfectly capture the crystalline structures of
experimentally characterized perylene polymorphs. Our modeling choice
to neglect long-range electrostatics is expected to influence the
thermodynamic stability of molecular packings.62 Furthermore, the Lennard-Jones interaction parameters and
bond lengths chosen in this work are “off-the-shelf”
OPLS parameters that have not been optimized for perylene. With these
modeling assumptions in mind, we conclude that our simple models of
perylene satisfactorily predict the broad phase behavior and reproduce
many of the structural features of perylene polymorphs observed in
experiments.

Perylothiophene Morphologies
As
with perylene, below TDO, systems with
ρ ≥ 0.91 g/cm3 self-assemble into ordered
morphologies that are characterized
by hexagonally arranged columns of π-stacked perylothiophene
molecules (Figure 3b). We observe another similarity between perylene and perylothiophene
in the π-stacked columns shown in Figure 8a, which is quantified in the simulated GIXS
pattern (Figure 8c).
Hexagonally packed features (Figure 8b) are also present, as can be seen in the corresponding
simulated GIXS pattern (Figure 8d). The stacks of perylothiophene molecules have no orientational
bias within the ordered stacks at higher temperatures, T > 400 K. However, as temperature decreases (below ∼400
K),
sulfur atoms aggregate along the perylothiophene stacks to form an
eclipsed phase in which perylothiophene molecules within the stack
have the same in-plane orientation (Figure 8e,f). Beyond increased aggregation and order
within columns, we additionally find that the perylothiophene columns
within the eclipsed phase arrange in a staggered formation, with increased
anisotropy between them, as shown in Figure 8g.

stack at 360 K. (g) Top-view simulation snapshot at 360 K in which
columns of perylothiophene form staggered conformations.

Unlike perylene, perylothiophene tends not to assemble
into an
α-herringbone structure and so exists only as a single, flattened-herringbone
β polymorph. This difference is likely due to the more strongly
ordered π-stacking arising from the balance between the dispersion
force and electrostatic interactions between the sulfur atoms in the
thiophene ring.62 The local structure of
the ordered and eclipsed phases is similar to that of the crystal
structure determined by Santos and co-workers containing regular π-stacking
of perylothiophene molecules within the system.65 Within the ordered phase, we measure an interplanar distance
of 3.44 Å and an intercolumnar distance of 10.50 Å. However,
the eclipsed phase resembles the experimentally determined structure
more closely, owing to the presence of aligned perylothiophene molecules
that are in a staggered conformation. We measure lattice parameters a = 9.34, b = 3.49, and c = 8.42 Å in the eclipsed state. These results broadly agree
with those reported from experiments by Santos and co-workers: a = 8.46 and c = 8.95 Å, whereas the b parameter is in excellent agreement b = 3.52 Å.65 The intercolumnar distances,
along with the a and c lattice parameters,
are different because our model predicts that the perylothiophene
molecules stack perpendicularly to the b axis and
not at an angle of 39.84°, as observed in experiments. Despite
these structural differences, the similarity in our results and experimental
structures indicates that our model successfully describes much of
the key physics governing self-assembly in perylothiophene.

Performance
The absolute performance of a computational
model depends on three factors: the number of TPS that can be calculated,
the number of time steps required for the random initial configuration
to relax to equilibrium (τr), and the number of time
steps between statistically independent frames (τa) determined from autocorrelations in the potential energy and structural
metric time series. It is useful to consider these parameters in terms
of the “wall-clock time”, normalizing τr and τa by TPS to determine tr and ta. To evaluate the computational
performance of rigid and flexible models, we compare tr and ta between the models
in disordered, ordered, and eclipsed regimes. Performance is summarized
in Table 1, where the
nonbonded contributions to potential energy ULJ and the crystallinity order parameter ψ each are used
to calculate relaxation and autocorrelation times. Values of tr and ta are normalized
by the flexible model ULJ-determined values
to give absolute relative performance values. For instance, the calculated
value of tr = 0.17 for rigid disordered
perylene indicates that the rigid model relaxes to equilibrium 5.88
times faster than the flexible model, if ψ is used as a structural
metric instead of ULJ. Conversely, the
calculated value of ta = 3.51 for rigid,
ordered perylene indicates that independent samples are generated
3.51 times more slowly than the flexible model, if ψ is used
as a structural metric instead of ULJ.
For each flexible–rigid pair of data in the system, the lower
number of the two indicates the more efficient simulation methodology
as relaxation or a statistically independent frame has been obtained
more quickly. These data are included un-normalized and in full in section S9.

a The time taken to relax to equilibrium tr and autocorrelation time ta are determined by normalizing τr and
τa by the TPS for each case, respectively. Values
of tr and ta are normalized to the performance of the flexible model for each
molecule calculated using ULJ. Smaller
numbers indicate better performance.

Sampling times ta are
generally larger
when determined by autocorrelations in the degree of crystallinity
ψ than when determined by ULJ autocorrelations.
This observation is important because potential energy is frequently
used as a proxy for the molecular structure, and we show here that
a direct measure of structures decorrelates more slowly than potential
energy. We therefore use autocorrelation times calculated from ψ
as the more conservative and accurate metric for both structural sampling
and performance comparisons.

For the state points studied here,
initial relaxation to equilibrium
is a small fraction of the total simulation time compared with sampling
the equilibrium distribution. We find that the time required to relax
to equilibrium as measured by ψ is faster than that measured
by ULJ. Furthermore, we find that the
rigid model is generally more efficient than the rigid model at relaxing
to equilibrium, independent of whether the simulations are performed
at disordered, ordered, or eclipsed regions of the phase space (Table 1). The only outlier
to this is the case of eclipsed perylothiophene morphologies, where
we find the rigid model to take 1.2 (ULJ) to 1.45 (ψ) times as long as the flexible model to reach
equilibrium.

Comparing the autocorrelation times ta as measured by ψ in Table 1, we find that the rigid model offers significant
performance
benefits when sampling independent configurations. The rigid model
is 3.2 times faster sampling disordered perylene than the flexible
model, 1.47 times faster sampling ordered perylene, and 1.64 times
faster sampling eclipsed perylene. For perylothiophene, the rigid
model is 11.5, 1.36, and 2.2 times faster sampling disordered, ordered,
and eclipsed phases, respectively. The factor of 11.5 times better
performance sampling disordered configurations of perylothiophene
could be particularly important in the simulation of asphaltenes that
include heteroatoms and have interesting disordered aggregation behavior.
Because the sampling portion of these simulations is the majority
of simulation time and because the rigid model offers a factor of
1.36–11.5 times better performance sampling statistically independent
structures, we recommend using rigid bodies to model polyaromatic
hydrocarbons when appropriate.

Conclusions
MD
simulations are used to investigate the self-assembly of perylene
and perylothiophene systems using a simplified molecular model. Perylothiophene
is shown to self-assemble hexagonally packed columns over a broader
region of the phase space than perylene, a consequence of the added
sulfur atom. Our models reproduce the structural features of these
molecules observed in experiments (where available), reproducing the
π-stacking distances of α-perylene, and simulated GIXS
analysis shows morphologies with features observed in β-perylene.
The predicted structures of perylothiophene match well with the lattice
parameters determined experimentally, particularly at lower temperatures,
where we see the emergence of staggered perylothiophene rings wherein
sulfurs aggregate along the columns. While the simplified united-atom
model used here captures much of the key physics governing perylene
and perylothiophene self-assembly, we note differences in lattice
parameters and the local molecular structure between the morphologies
observed here and experiments. In particular, the herringbone arrangement
of perylene molecules observed in α and β polymorphs is
not observed in this work. Preliminary simulations indicate that herringbone
arrangements emerge when long-range electrostatics are included.

We find close agreement between the phase transitions in experimental
works and the phase diagrams generated with both flexible and rigid
models. The only caveat found is that at high densities, where confinement
effects are most pronounced, the rigid model and flexible models differ
in their thermodynamically stable packings. We show that potential
energy autocorrelations underpredict how fast the structure is evolving
in these systems and demonstrate that the rigid model offers 1.36–11.5
times enhanced sampling per second. We therefore propose the use of
rigid models to accelerate the simulation of polyaromatic hydrocarbons.
In particular, these models offer promise to investigate assemblies
of asphaltenes in solution and alternative electron acceptors in photovoltaics,
two fields that require access to long aggregation timescales.
