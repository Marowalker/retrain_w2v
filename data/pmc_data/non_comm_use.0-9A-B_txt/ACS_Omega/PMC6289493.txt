A new
synthetic approach is established where both TiO2 nanoparticles
and glucose oxidase (GOx) are together
encapsulated into the cavity of ZIF-8 metal–organic
framework (MOF) to fabricate a mediator-free glucose sensor in aqueous
media. ZIF-8 possesses high stability both physically and chemically.
Moreover, its large surface area and tunable cavity size are supportive
to encapsulate both nanoparticles (TiO2) and enzymes (GOx). The as-synthesized nanocomposite is methodically
characterized by various advanced analytical techniques, which suggests
that TiO2 is uniformly distributed within the cavity of
ZIF-8 MOF. High surface area and double-layer capacitance of nanostructured
TiO2 jointly enhance the catalytic biosensor activity.
The as-synthesized nanocomposite exhibits commendable stability and
is able to detect low-level concentration (80 nM) of glucose in aqueous
media by utilizing very low concentration of GOx (62 μg in 1 mL).

==== Body
1 Introduction
Nowadays,
diabetes mellitus is known to be the most prevalent chronic
disease when compared to other harmful diseases that affect human
body. There are few reasons given by the World Diabetes Foundation:
the disease occurs mainly due to obesity and lack of physical activity.
Moreover, it is occurring frequently due to rapid urbanization and
modern lifestyle acquired by people. The disease has a direct effect
as it destabilizes the level of blood glucose in our body, which ultimately
causes grave health problems including cardiac arrest, kidney function
failure, and even deterioration of neurons.1 Generally, doctors recommend patients suffering from this disease
to check their level of blood glucose periodically and to take invasive
shots of insulin sporadically to manage the level of blood glucose
for a long time.2 Because the available
routine methods are associated with invasive methods such as injection,
which is painful, glucose monitoring in a noninvasive way is highly
necessary.3−5 It is been a long time since the first proposal from
Clark and Lyon in 1962 regarding the concept of glucose sensing, and
still new approaches are being invited by the scientific fraternity.
In earlier versions, atmospheric oxygen is used as mediator for glucose
sensor response. As technology evolves, new-generation glucose sensor
had been introduced according to the demand. As per the current requirement,
sophisticated techniques are in high demand, requiring less amount
of enzyme and operating noninvasively. Saliva/sweat can be taken as
an excellent medium of choice for noninvasive point-of-care glucose
monitoring. The state of the art in this area is reviewed by various
authors.6−8 One of the major challenges to date to fabricate
sophisticated glucose sensor of such type is the long-term stability
of the enzyme. Generally, enzymes, including also glucose oxidase
(GOD), are very much sensitive toward pH and temperature. New concepts
were introduced to freeze the activity of GOx by encapsulating into some rigid cavity. Mediator-free direct electron
transfer between the electrode and the active center of a redox protein
is one of the most important perceptions for the development of next-generation
biosensor devices.9 Flavin adenine dinucleotide
(FAD)/FADH2 present at the prosthetic group of glucose
oxidase (GOx) is known to be the active
redox species, but it is deeply enclosed inside the nonconducting
layer of rigid protein (GOx) structure.9,10

Metal–organic framework (MOF) shows promising diversity
and fascinated scientific community for its exclusive framework design,
large surface-to-volume ratio, and tunable pore sizes.11 Zinc-imidazole framework 8 (ZIF-8) is a subclass
of zeolitic MOF. ZIF-8 is a well-known microstructure due to its unique
cavity and tunable pore size to accommodate small to large biomolecules
and protect them from major external stimuli.12−20 On the other hand, metal nanoparticles possess exceptional physical
and chemical properties and can be used as a component of composite
as it possesses high surface area, which assists in reducing the electron
tunneling distance.21−26 Tandem catalysis is one of the interesting properties of a catalyst.
If a single catalyst can govern two concurrent reactions, it is called
a tandem catalyst. GOx encapsulated into
MOF moiety can act as tandem catalyst for glucose oxidation and H2O2 reduction.27 TiO2 nanoparticle is known to have high charge-storage ability
due to high double-layer capacitance. Using the same, there are reports
where TiO2 had been used as an active catalyst for nonenzymatic
biosensor. The double-layer capacitance of TiO2 can be
used as an effective source for charge-transfer agent at electrode–electrolyte
interface.9,28,29

In this
work, we have proposed an innovative protocol to encapsulate
both TiO2 and GOx jointly inside
the cavity of ZIF-8 to fabricate the as-synthesized nanocomposite
GOx@ZIF-8(TiO2) and successfully
utilize the same for the tandem glucose sensor application. The as-synthesized
material is drop-cast on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE), and amperometry
was performed to obtain the sensor response. The composite shows a
detection limit as low as 80 nM of glucose, which accredits the monitoring
of glucose from sweat. Commercially available TiO2 nanopowder
has been used after probe sonication. Moreover, the catalyst shows
tandem catalytic behavior to both glucose oxidation and peroxide reduction
simultaneously. The oxidation of glucose to gluconate was also confirmed
by standard colorimetric experiment by assaying glucose with glucose
oxidase–peroxidase (GOD–POD) moiety. The redox adjustment
of the couple FAD/FADH2 makes the catalyst different toward
sophisticated glucometer fabrication. This is the very first time
that both a semiconductor nanoparticle and an enzyme are encapsulated
into an MOF cavity. The presented work also envisaged low-level detection
of glucose (80 nM), which is significantly low compared to the previously
reported TiO2-based glucose sensor.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of Materials
The
as-synthesized GOx@ZIF-8(TiO2) material shows characteristic features due to the presence of crystalline
TiO2. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) was performed to
determine the phases of the synthesized probe after the compound was
vacuum-dried for 24 h. The PXRD spectra of the as-synthesized GOx@ZIF-8(TiO2) are depicted in red
in Figure 1. The PXRD
spectra of the as-synthesized composite are compared to the simulated
PXRD data of the standard ZIF-8, as depicted in blue of the same figure.
It is clearly visible from the PXRD comparison data that there is
a >95% PXRD peak matching of the synthesized probe compared to
the
standard peaks of ZIF-8, suggesting that the native structural property
of ZIF-8 remains intact after the encapsulation of TiO2 and GOx. Two distinct peaks at 25.36
and 48.17° confirm the presence of anatase TiO2 (JCPDS:
21-1272).30 The standard basal plane of
TiO2 (200) at 48.17° estimated from the XRD data is
correlated perfectly with the TEM result.

Figure 1 PXRD patterns of synthesized
GOx@ZIF-8(TiO2) along with
simulated ZIF-8 (JCPDS: 00-062-1030) GOx for comparison.

Field emission scanning
electron microscopy (FE-SEM) was done to
investigate the surface morphology of GOx@ZIF-8(TiO2) and is depicted in Figure 2A, which represents a distinct flowerlike
structure having many sheets at low magnification. At high magnification,
a hexagonal sheet was observed, as depicted in Figure 2B. The morphology reveals high surface area
of the probe due to the presence of TiO2 nanopowder. GOx is supposed to play a vital role along with
TiO2 in governing the morphology. It was previously known
that GOx has an affinity toward imidazole
by hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonding.27 Moreover, imidazole is considered to be the building block
of ZIF-8, and hence GOx controls the morphology
of the as-synthesized probe. Further, transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) was performed to investigate the spatial structure of the synthesized
microstructure and is depicted in Figure 2C. Distinctive lattice fringes were observed,
probably depicting the presence of TiO2. High-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) was performed to obtain
the plane of TiO2 lattice, and the result is depicted in Figure 2D. The HR-TEM image
shows the presence of (200) plane of anatase TiO2 with
distinct metal fringes and a d-spacing of 0.189 nm.

showing a hexagonal single sheet having large surface area; (C) TEM
image of TiO2 growth-assembled nanoparticles; (D) HR-TEM
image of TiO2 lattice fringes consisting of 200 TiO2 plane (anatase).

The result also matches with the PXRD data, which confirms
the
presence of (200) plane of TiO2. Scanning transmission
electron microscope–energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM–EDX)
had been done to get further concrete information regarding the encapsulation
of TiO2 into ZIF-8 moiety, and the result is depicted in Figure S1 (Supporting Information). The result
depicts that the TiO2 nanoparticle is distributed homogeneously
with an almost equal spatial distance within the cavity of ZIF-8 microstructure.

ZIF-8 possesses tunable pore size, which can accommodate biomolecules.
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) had been performed
to check whether GOx possesses its native
structure after encapsulation. The FT-IR spectrum is depicted in Figure 3. Characteristic
IR peaks for GOx are observed at 1651
and 1420 cm–1. The peak at 1651 cm–1 is considered to be the stretching vibration of peptidic −C=O
group of amide-I, whereas the peak at 1420 cm–1 corroborates
the in-plane bending vibration of N5H in FAD group.31 It can be clearly seen from the FT-IR spectrum
that 1654 cm–1 peak of amide-I slightly shifted
to 1651 cm–1. The resultant shift is due to the
effect of amide-I, which is already reported to be highly sensitive
toward structural modification.32

Figure 3 FT-IR spectra
of GOx@ZIF-8(TiO2) showing
distinctive peaks for the presence of glucose oxidase
(GOx) in its native form.

One of the prime concerns to obtain FT-IR spectra
is to validate
the presence of GOx in its native state,
and the existence of two peaks at 1651 and 1420 cm–1 clearly suggests that GOx is not degraded
by any external stimuli and possesses its native biological structure
inside the cavity of ZIF-8 MOF, showing biocatalytic activity.

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) had been done to estimate the
thermal stability of the as-synthesized probe. The TGA profile is
depicted in Figure S2 (Supporting Information).
It is clearly seen from Figure S2 (Supporting
Information) that there is a steep decrease of weight loss percentage
due to MOF decomposition. The weight loss at 165 °C corresponds
to the evaporation of occluded water and organic components. The latter
corresponds to framework degradation. The analysis envisaged the stability
profile of the as-synthesized probe, and it can be concluded that
the probe is stable up to ∼200 °C.

The nitrogen
adsorption–desorption curve was plotted and
a hysteresis was observed in the high-pressure region (>0.8 P/P0), proposing the formation
of type IV isotherm, which is associated with capillary condensation
taking place in mesopores and the limited uptake over a range of high P/P0. The initial part of the
type IV isotherm is attributed to monolayer–multilayer adsorption
since it follows the same path as the corresponding part of the type
II isotherm obtained with the given adsorption on the same surface
area of the adsorbent in a nonporous form. The adsorption–desorption
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) isotherm is depicted in Figure 4. The BET surface
area was measured as 353.8 m2/g, which is quite superior
to that of the previously reported TiO2 composite. High
surface area clearly envisaged uniform encapsulation of GOx and TiO2 into the ZIF-8 cavity.
To obtain the pore size distribution of the synthesized probe, the
Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) plot was plotted and is
depicted in the inset of Figure 4. The average pore volume and pore diameter are found
to be 0.248853 cm3/g (STP) and 28 Å, respectively.
The result is attributed to the ability of ZIF-8 matrix to accommodate
TiO2 and GOx.

isotherm of GOx@ZIF-8(TiO2)
showing hysteresis at >0.8 P/P0. The average pore volume
and pore diameter are calculated from the BJH plot as depicted in
the inset.

2.2 GOD–POD
Test to Assay d-Glucose
It has been already shown
that GOx can
possess its native structure inside ZIF-8 moiety due to the exceptional
tunable pore size of ZIF-8, which accommodates GOx and protects it from the external chemical stimuli. Furthermore,
to check the bioactivity of GOx inside
the ZIF-8 MOF, glucose oxidase–peroxidase (GOD–POD)
assay test was done. The general principle of this test is basically
the oxidation of glucose to gluconate in the presence of GOx, which acts as an enzyme. The reaction ends
up with the formation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, eqs 1 and 2), which can be uptaken by 4-aminophenazone, a chromogenic
oxygen acceptor, and in the presence of phenol, a peroxidase (POD)
quinone dye is formed, which shows red color upon completion of the
reaction27 1   2  GOD–POD was performed to examine
the
activity of the probe with possible interferent analytes like fructose,
galactose, lactose, and urea, and the outcome is visible by the naked
eye, which is depicted in Figure S3 (Supporting
Information). It is clearly visible that the synthesized probe is
exclusively selective toward glucose. Characteristic UV–vis
absorbance peak at 505 nm wavelength was found, which confirms the
presence of GOx inside the as-synthesized
composite probe. The outcome is depicted in Figure S4 (Supporting Information). The result suggests that GOx is biocatalytically active and definitely encapsulated
into ZIF-8 matrix.

2.3 Biosensor Response of GOx@ZIF-8 (TiO2)
High surface
coverage
of TiO2 and the excellent biocatalytic activity of GOx demonstrate the as-synthesized ZIF-8 composite
to be an admirable candidate for the fabrication of glucose biosensor,
accrediting a low-level detection of glucose from sweat/saliva. Cyclic
voltammetry (CV) technique is used to check the faradic behavior of
electrolyte or species attached with electrode, and for this purpose,
CV experiment was performed using GOx@ZIF-8(TiO2)-modified GCE at a scan rate of 50 mV/s. Prior to use, GCE
was polished in a 0.3 μ alumina slurry by putting in a high-mesh
pad, followed by ultrasonication in 1:1 ethanol–water mixture
for 15 min. Finally, the GCE was washed with Milli-Q water several
times and dried under room temperature. The electrode was kept covered
to avoid any unavoidable dust particles. The as-synthesized composite
(5 mg) was taken and homogeneous dispersion was prepared by taking
the same 1 mL of 0.1 M pH 7.4 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and
the resultant solution was ultrasonicated for 10 min. The resulting
dispersion was used as the aliquot for further electrochemical experiment.
A small amount of the aliquot (10 μM) was pipetted out using
a micropipette and drop-cast over the clean GCE of 5 mm diameter.
The electrode was dried at room temperature for 6 h, covered to avoid
external dust, and stored overnight at 4 °C.

The tailored
electrode was then immersed into a different concentration of glucose
in 0.1 M pH 7.4 PBS. The concentration of glucose was increased from
0 to 10 mM, and CV was taken in the range of −0.6 to +0.6 V.
Pt wire was used as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl (sat. KCl)
was used as the reference electrode. A decrement of cathodic current
at around −0.45 V vs Ag/AgCl (sat. KCl) was observed while
glucose concentration was increased. The result is depicted in Figure 5. The cathodic potential
for the possible glucose oxidation is quite similar to that of the
other reported catalysts (enzymatic and nonenzymatic). Cathodic peak
current was observed to decrease with increasing concentration and
plotted against concentration of glucose. A linear increment of anodic
current was found with increasing concentration, and the result is
depicted in the inset of Figure 5.

Figure 5 Cyclic voltammetry of synthesized probe with different
concentration
of glucose in pH 7.4 PBS using a three-electrode cell setup. Calibration
of cathodic peak current versus glucose concentration is depicted
in the inset.

The result shows the
excellent catalytic activity of the as-synthesized
probe to glucose oxidation reaction due to the production of H2O2, which results in a decrement of cathodic current/increment
of anodic current. Although the nature of the obtained current is
nonfaradic (mostly capacitive), the response is well sharp. The possible
oxidation reaction occurring at the electrode (GCE)–electrolyte
(glucose) interface can be correlated by the following equations (eqs 3 and 4) 3   4  The probe GOx@ZIF-8(TiO2) not only catalyzes the
glucose oxidation reaction but also
shows distinctive tandem catalytic property, which makes itself different
from other reported amperometric glucose sensors. The probe possesses
tandem catalytic activity, which is very unique as it can catalyze
the reduction of H2O2. A characteristic increase
of cathodic current was observed over different concentrations of
H2O2 at −0.45 V vs Ag/AgCl (sat. KCl).
The cathodic current increases due to the possible oxygen reduction
reaction occurring at the electrode surface. The result is depicted
in Figure S5 (Supporting Information).
The possible electrode reaction at the electrode surface is depicted
in the following equation (eq 5) 5  We have also performed control
experiment
to understand the role of TiO2 in this composite, and for
this purpose, we synthesized the material without having TiO2. The synthesized GOx@ZIF-8 was drop-cast
over GCE, and CV was taken in an air-saturated 10 mM glucose solution
in pH 7.4 buffer and compared to the CV with GOx@ZIF-8(TiO2). The result is depicted in Figure S6. The result clearly suggests that there
is an active role of TiO2 as a charge-storage tank as the
control experiment shows an almost nonfaradic linear current–voltage
response with mostly the migration of ions present in PBS. The as-synthesized
probe is not much affected by ion migration and can store charges
originated at the electrode surface due to the generation of H2O2, which is uptaken by TiO2 and transferred
to the electrode surface, resulting in the appearance of cathodic
peak.

The bioelectrocatalytic activity of the synthesized probe
is estimated
by calculating electroactive protein density (Γ, mol/cm2) using eq 6 6  where n, F, and A carry their usual meaning. To
calculate
Γ, CV was performed in 0.1 M pH 7.4 PBS at a scan rate of 100
mV/s. Γ is calculated to be 1.56 × 10–10 mol/cm2, which is quite superior to that of other TiO2-based amperometric glucose sensors.

To estimate the
steady-state response of the probe, the potentiostatic
amperometric technique was performed. In this technique, the potential
needs to be constant while an increment/decrement of current is observed
with respect to time. For amperometric glucose measurement, an increment
of current is measured with increasing concentration of glucose added
at a constant rate. To proceed with the experiment, 0.1 mM glucose
has been added successively into the air-saturated pH 7.4 buffer solution.
The potential chosen for chronoamperometry was −0.45 V vs Ag/AgCl
(sat. KCl), and the result is depicted in Figure 6. Dynamic stairs of current change were observed
with constant rise and saturation of current. A quick steady state
upon successive addition of glucose (∼5 s) was observed, which
depicts the efficacy of the probe toward glucose reduction reaction.
% Relative standard deviation (RSD) was calculated to check the analytical
performance of the synthesized probe, and 1.2% RSD was found for 20
successive dilutions, depicting the nature and stability of the synthesized
probe. The steady-state current, obtained from the amperometric plot,
was plotted with the change of concentration, and the result is depicted
in the inset of Figure 6. A linear calibration plot was obtained, which depicts the linear
proportionality of the obtained current with change of concentration.
The first rise of current was designated as lower detection limit
of this biosensor, and it was calculated at 80 nM glucose concentration.
Dissolved oxygen plays an immense role in this experiment as the current
achieved steady state gradually after 18 successive dilution. This
is probably due to the increment of dissolved oxygen, which vigorously
disturbs the FAD/FADH2 equilibrium. This low-level detection
of glucose can be strongly correlated with the measurement of blood
glucose from sweat/saliva and can be an active component of noninvasive
monitor of glucose.

Figure 6 Amperometric response of synthesized probe at −0.45
V vs
Ag/AgCl (sat. KCl) by adding 0.1 mM glucose successively in air-saturated
pH 7.4 PBS, resulting in a dynamic stair with quick steady state of
current. Calibration plot is depicted in the inset.

To investigate the tandem catalytic activity of
the probe, the
same steady-state response for the reduction of H2O2 was also investigated, and for this purpose, 0.1 mM H2O2 was added successively to the air-saturated
pH 7.4 buffer solution. The potential for the chronopotentiometry
is also kept fixed, and it was chosen to be the same as we added for
glucose monitoring: −0.45 V vs Ag/AgCl (sat. KCl). The current
versus time plot was obtained and is depicted in Figure S7 (Supporting Information). The result shows a decrement
of cathodic current at −0.45 V vs Ag/AgCl (sat. KCl), which
shows the excellent tandem catalytic activity of the probe toward
H2O2, having a quick steady state of ∼7
s that was achieved successfully.

3 Conclusions
Herein, we report a protocol for successful encapsulation of TiO2 and GOx inside ZIF-8 MOF to synthesize
a new probe GOx@ZIF-8(TiO2),
applicable for mediator-free amperometric detection of glucose. GOx and TiO2 are jointly encapsulated
into ZIF-8 matrix in aqueous media to form the composite GOx@ZIF-8(TiO2). The protocol supports
gram-scale synthesis and shows commendable stability and good tandem
catalytic activity. The as-synthesized composite was thoroughly characterized
by various physicochemical methods. Thermal analysis depicts excellent
stability of the probe, whereas X-ray diffraction analysis depicts
the crystalline structure of the synthesized probe with TiO2 nanoparticles in the anatase phase. The presence of TiO2 nanoparticles increases not only the effective surface area but
also the charge storage due to the presence of electrical double layer,
which ultimately influences charge transfer at the electrode–electrolyte
interface, resulting in excellent tandem catalytic activity toward
both glucose oxidation and peroxide reduction reaction. Using this
probe, a low-level detection of glucose can be achieved (80 nM) in
aqueous media by using very low concentration of GOx (62 μg in 1 mL), which can be attributed to the monitoring
of blood sugar by noninvasive way, mainly from sweat. Overall, the
synthetic probe can be demonstrated as competent, robust, and aqueous
media-tolerable nanocomposite applicable as tandem catalyst for both
glucose oxidation and peroxide reduction reaction.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials and Methods
Analytical
grades of titanium oxide nanopowder (TiO2), glucose oxidase
from Aspergillus niger (GOx), and 2-methylimidazole
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification.
Analytical-grade Zn(NO3)2·6H2O purchased from SRL Chemicals was also used without further purification.
The synthesis of GOx@ZIF-8(TiO2) nanocomposite was done in aqueous media at room temperature.

The conventional glassy carbon electrode (GCE) of 5 mm diameter had
been used as a working electrode for all electrochemical experiments
performed. Prior to the experiment, alumina slurry of size 0.3 μ
was put in a cloth of dense mesh and the electrode was polished gently,
followed by sonication for 15 min in 1:1 ethanol–water mixture
to get a clean GCE surface for drop-casting of the as-synthesized
composite. The electrode was washed several times with ultrapure Milli-Q
water and dried at room temperature prior to use for experiment. A
conventional electrolytic cell setup consisting of three electrodes
was used in all of the electrochemical experiments. Glassy carbon
was utilized as the working electrode, Pt wire (0.1 mm diameter) was
used as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl (sat. KCl) was used as
the reference electrode. The GOx slurry
of GOx@ZIF-8(TiO2) composite
was prepared for electroanalysis. Material (1 mg) is dispersed in
200 μL of pH 7.4 buffer to make the slurry, followed by ultrasonication
for 15 min. Furthermore, 5 μL of 0.5% nafion is mixed with the
slurry, which acts as a binder to make the material strongly attached
to the GCE surface. All of the electrochemical experiments were performed
in Metrohm Autolab 203 potentiostat/galvanostat.

The structure
of the as-synthesized composite was characterized
by various physicochemical techniques. PXRD (PAN Analytical Empyrean
Series 2 X-ray diffraction system) was done to investigate the crystal
structure of the synthesized probe. The morphology of the synthesized
microstructured material was investigated by FE-SEM (JEOL JSM-7100F)
and HR-TEM (JEOL JEM-2100). UV–vis spectra were recorded with
Varian spectrophotometer. FT-IR experiment was performed using PerkinElmer
G-FT-IR. TGA experiment was performed in Mettler Toledo instrument.
BET N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm was measured
in Micromeritics, ASAP 2010. The detailed synthetic procedure for
the fabrication of GOx@ZIF-8(TiO2) nanocomposite is described below. Metrohm Autolab 203 potentiostat/galvanostat
is used for all electrochemical measurements.

4.2 Synthesis
of GOx@ZIF-8(TiO2)
ZIF-8 was prepared by a previously
reported method.13 Two distinct synthetic
mixtures of 22.70 g of 2-methlyimidazole (108 mM) were dissolved in
400 mL of ultrapure Milli-Q water, and 50 mg of GOx (8170 units in 50 mg) was added to the same solution, labeled
(A). The resulting solution turned pale yellow. In another synthetic
mixture, 1.17 g of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (1.53 mM) was dissolved in another 390 mL of ultrapure Milli-Q
water separately and labeled (B). TiO2 nanopowder (5 mg)
was taken in 1 mL of Milli-Q water separately (C) and sonicated for
30 min until a homogeneous dispersion formed. The as-prepared (B)
and (C) solutions were added directly to the as-prepared mixture (A)
under constant stirring of 700 rpm at room temperature, and the total
reaction mixture was stirred for 3 h. It was observed that the solution
turned hazy from transparent pale yellow, which is the indication
for the encapsulation of both GOx and
TiO2 jointly inside ZIF-8 moiety. The probable haziness
may have appeared due to precipitation of the as-synthesized probe.
Then, the mixture was allowed to stand overnight in a 100 mL beaker
to settle down the desired precipitate. The settled solid precipitate
was slowly removed from the beaker using a micropipette and further
centrifuged in 10 000 rpm for 10 min. The precipitate was collected
and washed thoroughly with 50 mL of Milli-Q water three times to remove
excess GOx and TiO2, which
may have stuck to the surface of the synthesized MOF. Finally, the
probe was put in a dessicator and dried under vacuum. An off-white
solid composite was recovered, and this is the first initial confirmation
for the formation of GOx@ZIF-8(TiO2) nanocomposite. The synthetic route is schematically depicted
in Scheme 1. The as-synthesized
probe was further characterized by various physicochemical techniques
like FT-IR, PXRD, FE-SEM, HR-TEM, and UV–vis spectroscopies
to confirm the formation of the desired material.
