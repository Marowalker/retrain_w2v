Herein, we have designed
a metal-free donor–acceptor dye
by incorporating an electron deficient bisthiazole moiety as a linker
in between the electron donor triphenylamine and cyanoacetic acid
acceptor. The bisthiazole-based organic dye D1 was synthesized
using the Pd-catalyzed Suzuki cross-coupling and Knoevenagel condensation
reactions. On the basis of the optical, electrochemical, and computational
studies, dye D1 showed a better electronic interaction
between the donor and acceptor moieties. As-synthesized C2 symmetric triphenylamine-linked bisthiazole-based organic
dye D1 has four anchoring groups, which play a significant
role for better adsorption on the ZnO surface along with the enhanced
kinetics of photoexcited electron injection. Consequently, photovoltaic
properties of the organic dye D1 has been carried out
by fabricating the ZnO nanoparticles (ZnO NPs)-based solar device.
We obtained the maximum incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency
of about 56.20%, with a short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 13.60 mA cm–2, which
results in a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.94% under AM 1.5
irradiation (100 mW cm–2). The high PCE value is
the result of proficient electron injection from ELUMO of dye D1 to the conduction band of
ZnO NPs, as suggested by the computational calculations. Electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy measurement is carried out to calculate the
electron lifetime and also reveals the insight to the reduced charge
recombinations at the various active interfaces of the photovoltaic
device.

1 Introduction
The
photovoltaic system is considered to be one of the key renewable
energy sources that has the tendency to fulfill the rising global
energy demand and is also likely to play a vital role in carrying
the whole world toward a less harmful, consistent, and sustainable
energy system.1−3 Among all the photovoltaic devices, dye-sensitized
solar cells (DSSCs) have gained attention because of their simple
fabrication, economical and able to generate the high efficiency.4 Since the discovery of DSSCs with ruthenium (Ru)-based
dye and TiO2 semiconductor that show an efficiency value
of ∼7.1%, Grätzel and his team have been constantly
modifying the various segments of the device to enhance the efficiency
of the solar device. They achieved a remarkable PCE value of about
∼13% using zinc-porphyrin as a sensitizer and cobalt(II/III)
redox shuttle.5,6 Usually, the photoanodic segment
of a DSSC consists of metal oxide (TiO2, ZnO, SnO2, etc.), visible light-responsive material, that is, sensitizer,
and the collector electrode, that is, fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO).
Among all components, sensitizer is the most essential part through
which solar light is harvested and generates photoexcitons, followed
by injection of these photoexcited electrons to the metal oxide semiconductor.
In the present scenario, Ru-based light harvesters are mainly used
to enrich the efficacy value of DSSCs. Because of the wide range visible
light absorption, favorable energy band positions, longer electron
lifetimes, and high electrochemical stability, the Ru-based device
exhibited superior PCEs of about ∼11%.7−14 However, ruthenium-based photosensitizers have limitations in terms
of high cost, laborious synthetic routes, complicated purification
steps, and are hazardous for the environment.15 On a larger scale, the cost-effective fabrication of the photovoltaic
device has gained the main attention among the scientific community.
In this regard, metal-free sensitizers have gained considerable interest
due to their low cost, flexibility in modifying structural design,
and higher molar extinction coefficients.16 In the recent past, metal-free donor–acceptor (D–A)
organic dyes have been synthesized and used as an alternate to ruthenium-based
sensitizers for enriching the efficiency of the DSSC.17−24 Generally, metal-free organic dyes have donor−π bridge–acceptor
(D−π–A) assembly,25 where intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the donor and
acceptor groups occurs via π-conjugated spacer acting as a bridge.
Optoelectronic properties of organic dyes can be varied by introducing
dissimilar π-conjugated units between the D–A moieties, to induce a
shift for both the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the
lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels, whereas the stability
of these sensitizers is diminished by increasing the π-conjugated
bridges. For the stable metal-free dyes, electron-withdrawing moieties,
such as pyrimidine ring,26 isoxazole,27 quinoline,28 thiazole,29 thiadiazole,30 benzothiadiazole,31 diphenylquinoxaline,32 and bisthiazole,33,34 were introduced into the molecular
configuration of organic dyes. Recently, Wang et al. achieved a notable
PCE of about 9.8% for a metal-free sensitizer-based DSSC.35 Donor–acceptor dyes have been utilized
by several groups to considerably increase the efficiency value of
DSSCs.36

Bisthiazole is a widely
known electron-accepting unit owing to
the position of the electron-withdrawing nature of nitrogen of the
imine (−C=N) replacing the carbon atom at the third
position of thiophene.37 Bisthiazole having
an alkyl chain has been utilized as an electron acceptor unit to make
a blended structure with the donor moieties, such as oligothiophene38 and cyclopentadithiophene,39 exhibiting the unique optoelectronic properties to be used
in thin-film transistors, light-emitting diodes, and photovoltaic
applications. Polymer solar cells based on the bisthiazole copolymers
have been showed to have a high Voc value
and considerable efficacy.40 Thus, bisthiazole-based
organic moieties are considered to be promising light harvesters and
have contributed to enhance the efficiency of a solar device. However,
organic dyes containing bisthiazole moiety need to be explored further.
Hua and co-workers designed a series of organic dyes having bisthiazole
as a conjugated spacer33 and showed improved
light harvesting due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the bisthiazole
entity. Wong et al. designed new bisthiazole-functionalized dyes containing
different electron donors and fabricated DSSCs with promising performance.41 Chen et al. synthesized the 3-(5′-(4-(bis(4-tert-butylphenyl)amino)phenyl)-2,2′-bithiazol-5-yl)-2-cyanoacrylic
acid organic dye for the DSSC application.42

In the past decade, zinc oxide (ZnO) was considered to be
a suitable
alternative to TiO2 as the sensitizer scaffold for DSSCs.43 Both TiO2 and ZnO showed almost similar
optoelectronic properties due to their energy band alignments and
electron affinities. ZnO has some advantages over TiO2 in
terms of high electron mobility, much higher electron diffusivity,
and a large exciton binding energy. The highest reported efficiency
(η) for a ZnO-based DSSC is about 7.5%,44 which is much lesser as compared to that of a TiO2-based
DSSC (13%).6 As the obtained lower PCE
value of ZnO-based DSSCs are mainly due to the dissolution of ZnO
to Zn2+ during the dye loading and formation of agglomerates,
this results in minimal injection of photoinduced electrons from the
dye to the metal oxide.45 Therefore, an
appropriate duration for sensitizers loading on ZnO film can overcome
with this issue and improve the efficiency of device. To the best
of our knowledge, bisthiazole-based sensitizers have been rarely studied
for ZnO-based DSSCs.

Herein, we have designed and synthesized
a novel efficient organic
bisthiazole-bridged sensitizer, that is, dye D1 with
triphenylamine as the donor and a cyanoacetic acid moiety as the anchoring
group. The motivation behind the presented work is to synthesize the
dye D1 having multiple anchoring groups unlike the earlier
reported bisthiazole-based organic dyes.33,34 However, on the basis of the earlier reported literature, it is
stated that the performance of DSSCs is strongly dependent on the
number of anchoring groups present in the sensitizer molecule.46 Photovoltaic properties of this organic dye
have been investigated by fabricating the ZnO nanoparticles (ZnO NPs)-based
solar device, and solar light to current conversion efficiency of
about 4.94% has been achieved. The obtained high PCE value is a result
of efficient electron injection from ELUMO of dye D1 to the conduction band (CB) of ZnO NPs, revealed
through computational calculations, efficient loading of sensitizer
particles, and faster regeneration of oxidized dye from I–/I3– redox shuttle. Two long alkyl chains
attached on a bisthiazole moiety are considered to reduce the recombination
processes and acquire a high open-circuit photovoltage (Voc). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement
is carried out to understand the reduced charge recombination at the
various interfaces of the photovoltaic device and to calculate the
electron lifetime.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis
The triphenylamine-linked
bisthiazole-based donor–acceptor dye D1 was synthesized
by the Suzuki and Knoevenagel condensation reactions. The precursor,
5,5′-dibromo-4,4′-dibutyl-2,2′-bisthiazole (1) was prepared by using a previously reported protocol (Scheme S1).47 4,4′-((4-(4,4,5,5-Tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)phenyl)azanediyl)dibenzaldehyde
(a) was synthesized from 4,4′-((4-iodophenyl)azanediyl)dibenzaldehyde
by the Suzuki coupling reaction (Scheme S2). The compound (1) was reacted with 4,4′-((4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)phenyl)azanediyl)dibenzaldehyde
boronic ester under the Suzuki coupling reaction, with the condition
to get dye 2 in 55% yield. The reaction of dye 2 with cyanoacetic acid in dry dichloromethane (DCM) (5 mL)
and ammonium acetate stirred for 3 h at 65 °C in microwave, resulted
in the dye (2E,2′E,2″E,2‴E)-3,3′,3″,3‴-((((4,4′-dihexyl-[2,2′-bithiazole]-5,5′-diyl)bis(4,1-phenylene))bis(azanetriyl))tetrakis(benzene-4,1-diyl))tetrakis(2-cyanoacrylic
acid) D1 in 58% yield (Scheme 1). All of the compounds were well characterized
by 1H, 13C NMR, and high-resolution mass spectrometry
(HRMS) techniques.

2.2 Optical
Properties
The absorption
profile of triphenylamine-linked bisthiazole-based donor–acceptor
dye D1 has been recorded in DCM at room temperature (RT),
and the obtained optical data is listed in Table 1. The dye D1 exhibited a strong
absorption peak at 438 nm, corresponding to the intramolecular charge
transfer (ICT) transition from donor (triphenylamine) to acceptor
(cyanoacetic acid) moiety, as depicted in Figure 1. Although the organic dye D1 has a limitation in terms of a wide absorption range in the visible
light (energy band gap, Eg = ∼2.34
eV, calculated from electrochemical analysis), it has a higher value
of the molar extinction coefficient (∼1.02 × 105 L mol–1 cm–1), which is larger
than that of the conventional ruthenium-based sensitizer, that is,
N719 (∼1.39 × 104 L mol–1 cm–1),48 indicating
that dye D1 has a good light-harvesting ability and capability
to generate the higher influx of photogenerated excitons, which is
responsible for producing the high value of photocurrent. Because
of the presence of multiple anchoring groups, dye D1 shows
the better kinetics of photoexcited electron injection from dye to
ZnO for obtaining the high Jsc value of
the solar device.

2.3 Electrochemical Properties
The electrochemical
nature of triphenylamine-linked bisthiazole-based dye D1 was demonstrated by the cyclic voltammetric (CV) analysis, carried
out in dry DCM at room temperature, using tetrabutylammoniumhexafluoro
phosphate (TBAPF6) as a supporting electrolyte. Figure 2 represented the
cyclic voltammogram, and the obtained electrochemical data are listed
in Table 1. The dye D1 shows one reversible oxidation wave related to the triphenylamine
group and one reversible reduction wave belonging to the bisthiazole
group. As observed oxidation and reduction potential values for dye D1 are found to be ∼0.68 and ∼−1.66 V.
Energy levels for the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and
lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) are calculated by using
[EHOMO = −(Eonset,ox – E1/2,Ferrocene + 4.8) eV] and [ELUMO = −(Eonset,red – E1/2,Ferrocene + 4.8) eV], respectively. Estimated HOMO and LUMO energy levels
of the dye D1 are found to be −5.48 and −3.14
eV, respectively, and the calculated electrochemical band gap [Eg (eV) = EHOMO – ELUMO] is around 2.34 eV. The HOMO energy level
of dye D1 (−5.48 eV) is more negative compared
to that of the I–/I3– redox shuttle (Eredox ≈ −4.90
eV), facilitating a faster regeneration of the dye, whereas the LUMO
energy level of dye D1 (−3.14 eV) is more positive
than that of the conduction band of ZnO NPs (−4.24 eV), which
favors the efficient injection of photogenerated electrons from LUMO
of the dye to the CB of ZnO NPs.

2.4 Theoretical
Studies
The density functional
theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT)
studies were carried out using the Gaussian 09 program for better
understanding of the optical and electrochemical properties of the
dye D1. Optimization and solvent calculations were carried
out in DCM using the polarized continuum model (CPCM) of Gaussian
09 software and 6-31G** basis set for C, N, H, O, and S for all of
the calculations.49,50 The computational electronic
absorption spectra of dye D1 is depicted in Figure S4 along with individual experimental
UV–visible spectra. The dye D1 shows two major
intense absorption bands at 383 and 410 nm, probably due to transition
occurring from HOMO – 1 → LUMO + 1 and HOMO →
LUMO, respectively. The frontier molecular orbitals that further support
these transitions are related to the ICT from donor to acceptor moiety,
as shown in Table 2.

along with Their Oscillator Strengths (f) and Major
Contribution for Dye D1
The HOMO energy level of dye D1 (−5.74
eV)
is more negative as compared to that of the electrolyte I–/I3– (−4.90 eV), whereas the LUMO energy level (−2.92 eV)
of dye D1 is more positive than the conduction band of
ZnO NPs (−4.24 eV), which is desirable for the interfacial
transfer of photoexcited electron. The electron injection pathway
is feasible from the LUMO of dye D1 to CB of ZnO NPs,
as shown in Figure 3.

NPs, and electrolyte I–/I3–.

2.5 Powder
X-ray Diffraction Analysis (PXRD)
PXRD analysis was demonstrated
to analyze the phase purity and
crystal structure of as-prepared zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs),
as shown in Figure 4. The diffractogram of ZnO NPs showed that (101̅0), (0002),
(101̅1), (101̅2), (112̅0), (101̅3), (202̅0),
(112̅2), and (202̅1) crystal planes correspond to the
formation of wurtzite hexagonal crystal phase of ZnO, having cell
constants of a = 0.3249 nm and c = 0.5205 nm (JCPDS File Card No. 05-0664). There is no detectable
impurity peak in the PXRD pattern, confirming the purity of ZnO NPs.

2.6 Normalized UV–Vis
Diffused Reflectance
Spectra (UV–Vis DRS)
The UV–vis DRS spectra
of the ZnO NPs (black line), dye, D1 (red line), and
ZnO NP-dye, D1 (blue line) were recorded to study the
optical properties, as displayed in Figure 5. Absorption spectra of all material (as-fabricated
thin films) were recorded in the scan range of 300–800 nm by
using a glass substrate as a reference. From Figure 5, absorption edges of as-synthesized ZnO
NPs and dye D1 are found to be at ∼396 and ∼517
nm, respectively, related to the energy band gap of ∼3.13 and
∼2.39 eV, respectively. The dye exhibited two different absorption
bands in the UV as well as visible region. A shoulder absorption peak
in the UV region is due to π–π* transition, whereas
the peak in the visible region is attributed to the ICT from donor
(triphenylamine) to acceptor moiety (cyanoacetic acid).

line) and ZnO NP-dye D1 (blue line).
The inset of this figure depicts the corresponding Tauc’s plots.

The composite sample, that is,
ZnO NP-dye D1 has displayed
a similar absorption profile that relates to the band energy profile
of the individual component, as can be seen from two different absorption
edges. The inset of this figure depicted the Tauc plots for both samples
for calculating the energy band gap of the materials. The calculated
band gap energies for ZnO NPs and dye D1 are found to
be ∼3.13 and ∼2.41 eV, respectively, which are in good
matching with the values obtained from absorption spectra.

2.7 Steady State and Time-Resolved Photoluminescence
Analyses
To examine the excited-state electronic interactions
between ZnO NPs and dye (D1), steady-state photoluminescence
(PL) spectra of dye D1 (red line) and ZnO dye D1 (blue line) were recorded by monitoring the samples at excitation
of 370 nm, as shown in Figure 6A. In Figure 6A, both samples, that is, dye D1 and ZnO NP-dye D1, exhibited the same emission profile that is obtained at
∼564 nm. We observed a significant decrement in the PL intensity
of dye D1 when it was deposited over the ZnO NP film.
This observation suggested the presence of excited-state electronic
interactions between the dye and ZnO NPs. The possibility of photogenerated
charge injection from the dye to ZnO was further supported by estimating
their conduction band energy from electrochemical analysis and found
to be dye D1 (CB edge ∼ −3.14 eV) to the
ZnO NPs (CB edge ∼ −4.24 eV). The photoexcited electron
injection from the dye D1 to ZnO NPs is accountable for
producing the photocurrent while the redox shuttle scavenges the hole
at the same time.

Figure 6 Photoluminescence spectra (A) and time-resolved photoluminescence
(TRPL) spectra (B) of dye D1 (red line) and ZnO NPs-dye D1 (blue line) at an excitation wavelength of 370 and 375
nm, respectively.

To examine the kinetics
of photoexcited electron and emission decay
patterns, TRPL measurements are carried out for dye D1 as well as dye D1 adsorbed onto ZnO NPs, as shown in Figure 6B. We have fabricated
thin films for both the samples on a glass substrate using a 375 nm
diode laser excitation as the source. The average exciton lifetime
has been calculated by fitting both time-decay patterns with a triexponential
function (Table 3).
As-obtained multiexponential decay patterns revealed various processes
that are involved during the decay of emissive excitons. The values
of the fitting parameter (χ2) and other spectroscopic
results, such as, exciton lifetimes (τ1, τ2, and τ3), pre-exponential factors (α1, α2, and α3), average exciton
lifetimes (⟨τ⟩), etc. are given in the Table 3. The average lifetime
values are derived from eq 1(51) 1  In Figure 6B, the decay pattern
for dye D1 anchored
on ZnO NPs is found to be much faster, as compared to the bare dye D1, indicative of the charge injection from the conduction
band (CB) of the dye to the CB of ZnO. In Table 1, the corresponding average exciton lifetime
values for dye D1 and dye D1-ZnO NPs are
calculated and found to be ∼3.942 and ∼1.484 ns, respectively.
Similarly, the average exciton lifetime of dye D1-ZnO
NPs is significantly decreased compared to that of dye D1, which suggests efficient interfacial charge transfer from dye D1 to ZnO NPs. It was believed that charge transfer is the
only pathway for the deactivation of the excited dye D1, so the electron injection rate constant (keinj) from the dye to ZnO NPs is calculated from eq 2 and listed in Table 3(50) 2  The keinj value
for the composites, that is, dye D1-ZnO NPs, is found
to be ∼4.20 × 108 s–1 (from Table 3), resulting in faster
charge injection dynamics in the composite and leads to the reduced
recombination processes that favor the enhanced photovoltaic performance
of the solar device.

2.8 Chemisorption and Surface
Area analysis
Chemisorption of dye molecules is performed
to calculate the quantity
of adsorbed dye on the ZnO NPs-based photoanode. To estimate the quantity
of the adsorbed dye, the photoanodic film with fixed area (1 cm2) after dye deposition is rinsed in acetonitrile to eliminate
the loosely bound dye molecules and then immersed into 0.1 mM sodium
hydroxide solution [ethanol/water, 1:1, v/v] for a few hours to completely
desorb and fully deprotonate the dye.52 After complete desorption of the dye, UV–vis absorbance is
recorded. Then, the concentration of the desorbed dye per cm2 area is estimated by using Beer’s law. It was observed that
the photoanode showed an optimum quantity of dye loading, with value
of ∼0.506 × 10–7 mol cm–2.

Figure 7 represented
N2 physisorption isotherms for as-prepared ZnO NPs, and
inset of this figure depicted the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) pore size distribution of the same material. High surface area
and porosity for a photoanodic material are the key attributes to
be used in photoanodic segment to enrich the performance of photovoltaic
devices.

Figure 7 Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) pore size distribution plot (inset) for ZnO NPs.

The mesoporous nature of the ZnO NPs was confirmed
by the type
IV isotherms with H3 hysteresis loop, as noticed in Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) isotherm. The BET surface area value for ZnO NPs is found to
be 46 m2 g–1, which is a significant
value for higher deposition of sensitizer molecules. From the inset,
we can see that pore distribution in ZnO NPs is noticed to be in the
range of 15–50 nm, which further advocates the mesoporous
nature of as-synthesized ZnO NPs.

2.9 Photovoltaic
Measurement of Solar Cells
Figure 8A showed
the photocurrent–voltage (J–V) characteristics
of the as-fabricated DSSC, namely, FTO/ZnO NPs/ D1 dye/
I–/I3– /Pt/FTO, measured
by using a bisthiazole-bridged (D1) dye as a light-absorbing
material against a platinized FTO as a counter electrode (CE) and
the I–/I3– redox electrolyte.
The values of all photovoltaic parameters, such as the short-circuit
current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage
(Voc), fill factor (FF), and power conversion
efficiency (PCE, η) of as-fabricated device are summarized in Table 4 and found to be ≈13.60
mA cm–2, ≈620 mV, ≈58.62%, and ≈4.94%,
respectively.

Figure 8B represented
the IPCE as a function of the wavelength for the as-fabricated DSSC.
The observed high Jsc value might be due
to the efficient interfacial charge injection from the dye to ZnO,
higher dye loading, and faster regeneration kinetics of I–/I3– redox electrolyte, which is also
explicit from the IPCE plot of the respective device. The estimated
IPCE value for the as-fabricated device is found to be ≈56.20%
in the wavelength range of 360–525 nm, which is in good accordance
with the UV–vis analysis. The inset of Figure 8B showed the feasible pathway for the photoexcited
electron injection from the LUMO of dye D1 (−3.14
eV) to the CB of ZnO NPs (−4.24 eV).

2.10 Electrochemical
Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS)
Analyses
The electron transport at various interfaces and
charge recombination kinetics are further examined by recording the
electrochemical impedance spectra for the as-fabricated device in
a frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz under dark conditions by
applying an external bias equivalent to the Voc, as shown in Figure 9A,B. The EIS analysis elucidates the charge transfer as well
as recombination processes occurring at various interfaces of the
fabricated DSSC, for example, the low-frequency region (0.1−0.01
Hz) corresponds to the diffusion of electrolyte in the photoanodic
film, the mid-frequency region (0.1 Hz to 1 kHz) corresponds to the
charge transfers at the ZnO/dye/electrolyte interface, and the high-frequency
region (1−100 kHz) corresponds to the charge transfers at the
counter electrode/electrolyte interface.53

plot displays the equivalent circuit diagram for the as-fabricated
photovoltaic device, and the abbreviations used are as follows: Rs is the sheet resistance; Rct1 and Rct2 are charge-transfer

in the higher frequency region and the other in the medium frequency
region. The device has shown a larger radius of the right semicircle
(Rk), which mainly relates to the charge-transfer
resistance (Rct).54,55 A large value of Rct infers an impeded
backward reaction of the photoinjected electrons at the semiconductor/sensitizer/electrolyte
interface, resulting in the enhancement of charge collection efficacy
at the electrode. If the radius of the right semicircle is large then
the device exhibits a longer electron lifetime (τe), attributed to better interfacial charge separation.

The
photoinduced electron lifetime (τe) has been
calculated from the characteristic maximum peak frequency (fmax) in the mid-frequency region of the corresponding
bode phase plot. We have calculated the value of τe by using the eq 3(56) 3  From Figure 9B, maximum peak frequencies
for the as-fabricated device
are found to be present at ∼11.14 Hz and the corresponding
τe value for the same device is calculated and found
to be ∼14.28 ms, mentioned in Table 4. The as-obtained higher value of the open-circuit
voltage (Voc) is a result of reduction
in charge recombination processes due to the presence of two long
alkyl chains on a bisthiazole moiety that are considered to reduce
the dark current. The observed high (τe) value for
the photovoltaic device advocated the minimum recombination processes,
occurring due to back transferring of photoinduced electrons to the
electrolyte at the working electrode/electrolyte interfaces.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we have designed and synthesized
a metal-free donor–acceptor
dye by incorporating electron deficient bisthiazole moiety as a linker
in between electron donor triphenylamine and cyanoacetic acid acceptor.
Photophysical, electrochemical, and computational analyses of this
dye have been performed. The steady state and dynamic PL analyses
advocated the charge injection from the LUMO of dye D1 to the CB of ZnO NPs. Improved light harnessing capability of this
organic dye is accredited to the electron-withdrawing nature of the
bisthiazole moiety. The photovoltaic performance of this donor–acceptor
dye has been carried out by fabricating the ZnO nanoparticles (ZnO
NPs)-based DSSC. All photovoltaic parameters, such as Jsc, Voc, FF, PCE, and IPCE of the as-fabricated
device are found to be ≈13.60 mA cm–2, ≈620
mV, ≈58.62%, ≈4.94%, and ≈56.20%, respectively.
The as-obtained high PCE value is a result of efficient electron injection
from the dye to ZnO owing to presence of multiple anchoring groups,
efficient loading of sensitizer particles, and faster regeneration
of the oxidized dye from the I–/I3– redox shuttle. The higher value of electron lifetime
(τe) advocated the minimum recombination processes;
occurring due to back transferring of photoinduced electrons to the
electrolyte at the working electrode/electrolyte interfaces. These
observations indicated that the Bisthiazole linker-based metal-free
dyes are auspicious candidates for the enrichment in the performance
of DSSCs.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
and Reagents
The materials
used in the synthetic procedure and device fabrication were of analytical
grade and used without further purification. Zinc chloride (Merck),
ethyl cellulose (Himedia), 4-tert-butylpyridine (Himedia),
chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (Sigma-Aldrich), ammonium hydroxide
(Merck), iodine (Merck), lithium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich), acetonitrile
(HPLC grade, Merck), dichloromethane (DCM, Merck), valeronitrile (Sigma-Aldrich),
terpineol (Himedia), hydrogen chloride (Merck), 1-butyl 3-methyl imidazolium
iodide (Sigma-Aldrich), and ethanol (TEDIA, USA) are used. Fluorine-doped tin oxide
(FTO, sheet resistance 12–14 Ω cm–2)-coated glass substrates were procured from Sigma-Aldrich. The water
used for the experiments is Milli-Q water (18.2 MΩ cm–2). All of the chemicals reagents used during the synthesis of dye D1 are mentioned in the synthetic protocol.

4.2 Synthesis Procedure of ZnO Nanoparticles (ZnO
NPs)
ZnO NPs are synthesized by following a protocol reported
by Becheri et al.57 Typically, 8 mmol zinc
chloride is first dissolved in deionized water (40 mL) and then kept
under stirring condition at 90 °C. A 3.2 mL 5 M sodium hydroxide
solution is then added dropwise into the above solution and continued
to be stirred for 40 min. After naturally cooling down to room temperature
(RT), the supernatant liquid is discarded and the precipitate is washed
several times with water and finally dispersed in 2-propanol using
ultrasonic bath. The solution is then dried at 70 °C for 6 h,
and finally the product is calcined at 500 °C for 1 h to obtain
ZnO nanoparticles.

4.3 Fabrication of Devices
All of the
device photoanodes were fabricated using a homogenous paste of ZnO
NPs and deposited over FTO. Initially, 0.2 g of ZnO NP powder was
ground with a mixture of ethanolic solution of ethyl cellulose and
terpineol in an agate mortar pestle to obtain a homogenous paste.
The as-prepared homogeneous paste was then deposited on the FTO substrate
via the doctor blade method and heated at 80 °C for 40 min in
a hot air oven. Thereafter, as-deposited ZnO films were calcined at
450 °C for 45 min to eradicate all of the organic components.
The thickness of the deposited ZnO layer was in the range of around
∼9–12 μm. These substrates were then dipped into
0.3 mM dye (D1) solution in acetonitrile/ethanol (1:1)
for 3 h at room temperature. The sensitized photoanodes were then
taken out, washed with EtOH, and dried under a hot air blower. Finally,
the sensitized photoanodes and counter electrode (CE) devices were
assembled by sandwiching. CEs were fabricated by spin-coating an isopropanolic
solution of chloroplatinic acid (5 mM) on a cleaned, ozonized FTO,
followed by 30 min of calcination at 450 °C in a muffle furnace.
The I–/I3– electrolyte
solution was introduced between the sandwiched devices. The I–/I3– solution contains
0.05 M I2, 0.1 M guanidium thiocyanate, 0.5 M LiI, and
0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in a 9:1 (v/v) mixture
of acetonitrile/valeronitrile. The active area for all devices was
fixed to 0.16 cm2. All of the DSSCs were kept under dark
condition for 24 h prior to the photovoltaic measurements.

4.4 Measurements and Material Characterization
NMR spectra
were recorded in a Bruker Avance (III) 400 MHz instrument
using CDCl3 as solvent for 1H NMR (400 MHz)
or 13C NMR (100 MHz). Chemical shifts (δ) are reported
in ppm and coupling constants (J) are given in Hz.
Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were carried out using a thermogravimetric
analyzer (Mettler Toledo Thermal Analysis system). A Cary-100 Bio
UV–visible spectrophotometer was used to record UV–visible
absorption spectra of bare dye (solution phase). Cyclic voltammograms
(CVs) were recorded using a three-electrode system, the saturated
calomel electrode (SCE) [reference electrode], glassy carbon [working
electrode], and Pt wire [counter electrode] at 100 mV s–1 scan rate on a CHI620D electrochemical workstation. A solution of
TBAPF6 (0.1 M, tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate)
in CH2Cl2 was used as the supporting electrolyte.
Freshly distilled DCM from CaH2 was used. The reduction
and oxidation peaks were calibrated using the ferrocene/ferrocenium
ion (Fc/Fc+) system. Here, the Fc/Fc+ couple exhibited E° = 0.38 V versus SCE. The Bruker-Daltonics micrOTOF-Q
II mass spectrometer was used for recording HRMS spectra.

Bruker
D2 Phaser X-ray diffractometer was used to record the powder X-ray
diffraction spectra, having Cu Kα (λ = 1.54 Å) X-
ray source with 10 mA operating current and 30 kV operating voltage,
respectively. The JASCO Model V-650 spectrophotometer was used to
record UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS), with BaSO4 used as an internal standard, using a 150 mm integrating
sphere. The steady state and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL and
TRPL) measurements studies were carried out using a Horiba–Jobin
Yvon Fluoromax 4 spectrophotometer and LifeSpec II Edinburgh instrument
(excitation laser source of 375 nm), respectively. The thickness of
the ZnO film deposited onto FTO was evaluated using a profilometer
(Veeco Dektak-150). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)
surface area analysis was carried out using Beckman-Coulter SA 3100
N2 adsorption apparatus. The samples were degassed at 150
°C for 4 h prior to surface area analysis. The Keithley 2400
source-meter was used to record the J–V measurements
for the fabricated devices in dark as well as in light (under an AM
1.5 G artificial solar light of 100 mW cm–2 calibrated
by a standard Si photovoltaic cell). The electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed using the CHI680E model
(CH instruments Inc., Austin, TX). Incident photon-to-current conversion
efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the fabricated devices were recorded
in a Newport ORIEL IQE-200 instrument fitted with a 250 W quartz tungsten
halogen lamp.
