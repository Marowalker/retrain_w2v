Micro
RNA (miRNA)-based medicines have attracted attention as new
therapeutic strategies to treat genetic diseases and metabolic and
immunological disorders. MiRNAs have emerged as key mediators of metabolic
processes fulfilling regulatory functions in maintaining physiological
conditions, while altered miRNA expression profiles are often associated
with genetic diseases. However, naked miRNAs exhibit poor enzymatic
stability, biomembrane permeation, and cellular uptake. To overcome
these limitations, the development of appropriate drug delivery systems
(DDS) is necessary. Herein, a DDS is characterized being assembled
from miRNA-27a (negative regulator in fat metabolism) and the amphipathic
N-TER peptide. Dynamic light scattering (DLS), electrophoretic light
scattering, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) are used to investigate
physicochemical properties (i.e., size, shape, and charge) of the
DDS. Although surface charges should provide decent stabilization,
the AFM results confirm a state of agglomeration, which is also suggested
by DLS. Furthermore, AFM studies reveal adhesion on hydrophilic as
well as hydrophobic substrates, which is related to the amphipathic
properties of the N-TER peptide. Physicochemical properties of DDS
are important parameters, which have an impact on cell internalization/uptake
and have to be taken into account for in vitro studies to develop
a successful peptide-based DDS for miRNA replacement therapy in metabolic
diseases, such as obesity and others.

Introduction
Micro
RNA (miRNA)-based medicines have attracted attention as promising
tools for developing new therapeutic strategies to treat genetic diseases
and metabolic and immunological disorders. In general, miRNAs are
endogenous noncoding RNAs, which regulate posttranscriptional regulation
of gene expression by degradation or translational repression, and
thus, they are often involved in the onset and progression of various
genetic diseases.1 These small nucleic
acids fulfill important regulatory functions in diverse biological
processes including cell proliferation, cell differentiation, apoptosis,
and metabolism.2−4 However, abnormal miRNA expression, diverging from
physiological levels, can be associated with disease development5 resulting in cancer,6−8 metabolic disorders,9,10 or autoimmune diseases.11,12 In particular, increasing
prevalence of overweight and obesity has emerged as a global health
problem and is often associated with obesity-related chronic conditions,
such as diabetes, dyslipidemia, several cancers, and/or cardiovascular
diseases.13,14 In this regard, antiadipogenic miRNAs, such
as miRNA-27a, might act as a new therapeutic approach as miRNA mimic
replacement therapy to prevent or treat obesity by inhibiting adipocyte
differentiation through downregulation of adipogenic marker genes
(i.e., PPARγ).14−16

Although nucleic acid-based therapies show
great potential to treat
several genetic diseases, application of naked miRNAs faces some additional
challenges. On the one hand, unprotected nucleic acid molecules might
be rapidly degraded, and on the other hand, the hydrophilic molecules
often show low biomembrane permeability and cellular uptake, which
is related to the anionic phosphodiester backbone resulting in electrostatic
repulsion from the anionic cell membrane surface.1,17,18 Therefore, the development of suitable drug
delivery systems (DDS) is of paramount importance to turn miRNAs into
medicine. Appropriate DDS for miRNAs have to fulfil some requirements,
which provide protection against enzymatic degradation, cell membrane
interaction, cell uptake, and intracellular release and distribution.
Promising candidates to develop delivery tools for nucleic acids comprise
the family of cell penetrating peptides (CPP). CPP are a class of
small cationic peptides, consisting of less than 30 amino acids and
are designed from sequences of membrane-interacting proteins, which
successfully enable the delivery of anionic molecules across cell
membranes into intracellular compartments.18−21

The spontaneously induced
self-assembly complexation between the
cationic peptides and anionic nucleic acids, based on electrostatic
interactions, represents a technically simple process to form a DDS.
It has already been described by using different peptides of the CPP
family, which includes cationic peptides, such as protamine,22,23 or amphipathic peptides, such as MPG24,25 standing for
May, Pierre, and Gilles, the names of the people who discovered the
peptide. Among the CPP, MPG belongs to the primary amphipathic peptides
and consists of 27 amino acids arranged in a sequential assembly of
hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues. The hydrophobic domain, derived
from HIV-1 gp41 (GALFLGFLGAAGSTMGAWSQPKKKRKV), enhances interactions
with the hydrophobic lipid moieties on the cell surface, whereas the
hydrophilic domain, derived from the nuclear localization sequence
(NLS) of SV40 large T antigen (PKKKRKV), promotes electrostatic interactions
with negatively charged nucleic acid molecules as well as with glycosaminoglycans
on the cell membrane surface. The hydrophobic and the hydrophilic
domains of MPG, hereinafter referred to the trading name “N-TER
peptide”, are connected with the linker sequence WSQ.18,25,26

The abilities of CPP, in
particular of amphipathic N-TER peptide,
to rapidly condense negatively charged miRNAs and to translocate their
cargos into cells make these peptides promising candidates for drug
delivery applications. To overcome biological barriers, however, physicochemical
characterization is very important to understand the interactions
between the therapeutic molecule (miRNA-27a) and the peptide (N-TER
peptide), forming the DDS. Physicochemical parameters including size,
shape, and charge often influence cellular internalization and uptake
and provide essential information to design an appropriate DDS with
optimal effectiveness for miRNAs in vitro.1,27,28 In addition, it must be taken into account
that biological media, which often resemble both in vitro and in vivo
conditions, highly influence and might alter physicochemical characteristics,
particularly stability. Therefore, physicochemical properties need
to be investigated extensively to provide new opportunities for developing
miRNA-based therapeutics.

Herein, it is demonstrated that the
N-TER peptide successfully
forms complexes with miRNA-27a. Furthermore, physicochemical characterization
using dynamic light scattering (DLS), electrophoretic light scattering
(ELS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) are used to investigate complexation
behavior. Important key parameters of this peptide-based DDS for miRNAs,
such as the particle size, geometry, zeta potential, and stability,
will be presented and discussed in this paper.

Results and Discussion
Topography
of Particles
To gain knowledge about the
complexation behavior of amphipathic N-TER peptides with nucleic acids,
a gradual addition of different components to the peptide was performed.
The investigations of various stages were analyzed using AFM height
images (see Figure 1), whereby N-TER peptides mixed with RNase-free water (Figure 1a); RNase-free water and siRNA
dilution buffer (Figure 1b); or RNase-free water, siRNA dilution buffer, and fluorescent-labelled
nucleic acid control (FluoNTC; Figure 1c1) were investigated.

Figure 1 AFM height images of the N-TER peptide
in RNase-free water (a),
additionally mixed with siRNA dilution buffer (b), and finally complexed
with FluoNTC (650 nM, c1). Images of the standard N-TER peptide–FluoNTC
complexes (650 nM) are captured by combining fluorescence and DIC
microscopy (c2), showing the same sample area as presented in c1.
The scale is 0.5 μm for the N-TER peptide alone (a,b) and 2
μm for N-TER peptide–FluoNTC complexes (c1).

Starting with the N-TER peptide alone, that is,
only mixed with
RNase-free water, reveals the formation of agglomeration (see the
left hand side of Figure 1a). The AFM results show occasionally formed N-TER peptide
complexes being located at the sample surface with a size of 200–300
nm and of rather spherical appearance. Further, a thin film of probably
unbound peptide material is located in its surrounding. The presence
of N-TER peptide complexes is interesting, whereby this self-assembly
of this pure material might be explained by peptide–peptide
interactions because of the hydrophobic domain of amphipathic peptides,
which seems to favor agglomeration.24,34−36 It was also shown in the literature that the propensity to form
agglomerates strongly depends on how concentrated the hydrophobic
residues are arranged in the sequence of the peptide as a continuous
block.37 Therefore, amino acid composition
as well as their sequence in the amphipathic peptide play an important
role during agglomeration.36 This phenomenon
of peptide-based self-assembly is further enhanced by adding siRNA
dilution buffer to the aqueous N-TER peptide solution, which is recommended
according to the description for N-TER nanoparticle siRNA transfection
system preparation.29

The addition
of more ions in the buffer to the aqueous peptide
solution leads to enhanced particle formation, e.g., more particles
are present (Figure 1b). Further, many particles appear to form agglomerations with others,
which then result in strongly enlarged structures. It can be estimated
that 10 to about hundred particles pack to achieve such structures.
At this point, it has to be noted that the withdrawal of liquid due
to evaporation might also induce the described agglomeration phenomenon
under measurement conditions in air. However, these concerns can be
excluded based on DLS data clearly confirming the system-specific
agglomeration behavior, which will be discussed in detail in the following
sections.

These observations here are in good accordance with
the literature
discussing the influence of alternating ionic strength on the particle
size and agglomeration.38−40 This suggests that by adjusting
some of the preparation protocol, the self-assembling of the pure
peptide can be minimized.

For the situation of the amphipathic
peptides already tending to
self-assemble by itself, the question arises, which experimental approach
is required to distinguish between just N-TER peptide particles and
N-TER peptide–nucleic acid complexes, representing the DDS.
For this purpose, AFM investigations are combined with optical methods
including fluorescence and differential interference contrast (DIC)
microscopy. For complexation with the N-TER peptide, a FluoNTC is
used in the presence of RNase-free water and siRNA dilution buffer.
In Figure 1c1, the
complexes are visualized by AFM imaging at a glass surface. Their
size is 200–300 nm, which is about the same with respect to
the pure peptide. Our special AFM-microscopy setup allows the determination
of fluorescence at the very same position (see Figure 1c2), showing a clear fluorescent signal of
the successfully complexed FluoNTC with the N-TER peptide (Figure 1c2, white circles).
In contrast to the observations obtained from fluorescence microscopy,
some complexes are detected by DIC microscopy and AFM without exhibiting
any fluorescent signal (Figure 1c2, white squares). Based on the results in Figure 1a demonstrating peptide-based
self-assembly, it is therefore assumed that the nonfluorescent complexes
are only composed of the N-TER peptide, without FluoNTC. Such a result
might be easily understood by the fact that adding an excess amount
of the N-TER peptide is absolutely critical to form a highly stable
DDS for nucleic acids.24,41 As this excess is prone to self-assembly,
this means that two types of particles can be found in such an experiment.

In principle, the complex formation of the N-TER peptide with nucleic
acids is explained by a noncovalent mechanism, which initially occurs
through electrostatic interactions between both components. The electrostatic
interactions involve the positively charged hydrophilic lysine-rich
NLS domain of the peptide and the negatively charged phosphate backbone
of nucleic acids, followed by peptide–peptide interactions
involving the hydrophobic domains.18,21,41 This phenomenon of spontaneously induced self-assembly
was described for positively charged CPP to condense polyanionic compounds,
such as nucleic acids or oligonucleotides.23,42 Morris et al. further hypothesized that additional interactions
take place between the hydrophobic peptide moieties and most likely
result in a peptide “cage” around the nucleic acids,
which can successfully protect them from enzymatic degradation to
form a stable DDS.20

In Situ Size
and Stability
As already shown in the
AFM images, N-TER peptide-based systems tend to self-assemble by itself,
which is mainly influenced by their hydrophobic amino acid composition.
Nevertheless, on drying of the samples, these assembling might result
as strong changes in the environment during solvent evaporation. To
check particle size progression of N-TER peptide–nucleic acid
complexes as a function of time and concentration, measurements using
DLS are performed. The time-dependent DLS investigations are carried
out (immediately, 1, 3, and 5 h after preparation) using standard
N-TER peptide complexes containing 650 nM of FluoNTC, nontargeting
control (NTC), or miRNA-27a, respectively, in the final dispersion
(Figure 2). The DLS
data in Figure 2 (on
top) display a certain size range for the main particle fraction between
200 and 300 nm directly after preparation. This matches perfectly
for all three nucleic acids used for complexation with the N-TER peptide.
The continuous observations show that after 1 h, the initially observed
particle size slightly increased. This increase continues with time,
and after 3 and 5 h, still an increase of the particles size is observed,
meaning that the agglomeration is continuing over the course of the
experiment. This event is even further enhanced after 24 h, which
results in continued agglomeration and increase of polydispersity,
indicating that this DDS is not appropriate for long-term storage
(unpublished experiments).

Figure 2 Time-dependent DLS measurements of standard
N-TER peptide complexes
containing FluoNTC (white bars), NTC (weakly dashed bars), or miRNA-27a
(strongly dashed bars) characterized as the intensity-based particle
size (on top) and PdI (below). Final nucleic acid concentrations are
650 nM, respectively.

The increase in size is according to its statistical nature
not
well defined, so that the polydispersity index (PdI) increases over
time. In detail, the PdI-values started at 0.2 immediately after preparation
and increase up to 0.6 after 5 h (Figure 2, below). The PdI generally provides important
information about mono- or polydisperse properties of DDS. The classification
of PdI-values indicates that values ≤0.1 are considered to
be highly monodisperse while values of 0.1–0.4 or ≥0.4
are considered to be moderately or highly polydisperse, respectively.43

The DLS findings allow the following conclusions
to be drawn: first,
the standard N-TER peptide–nucleic acid complexes (650 nM)
demonstrate that very moderate polydisperse or close to monodisperse
properties are present immediately after preparation. Second, the
time-dependent agglomeration tendency of the DDS might be explained,
on the one hand, by the self-assembly properties of amphipathic peptides
due to hydrophobic amino acids24,35,41 and, on the other hand, by a concentration-dependent effect due
to a higher probability of particle interactions with increasing concentrations.34,39,43 Third, the three nucleic acids
used for complexation with the N-TER peptide, namely FluoNTC, NTC,
and miRNA-27a, show similar complexation possibilities. With regard
to further studies, this comparable complexation behavior of the applied
nucleic acids with the N-TER peptide is supported by exhibiting similar
chain lengths (20–24 nucleotides) and molecular weights (about
14 000 g/mol).23,39

Stability Depending on
Environmental Changes
To identify
the effect of the dilution medium on the particle stability, the behavior
of N-TER peptide–nucleic acid complexes in RNase-free water,
zeta water, or serum-free low glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle
medium (DMEM) is evaluated using DLS. For this purpose, standard N-TER
peptide–nucleic acid complexes (650 nM) are diluted immediately
after preparation to obtain nucleic acid concentrations of 100 nM
FluoNTC, NTC, or miRNA-27a, respectively. The selected concentration
range is a common concentration applied in cell culture in vitro studies.
DLS measurements are then performed (immediately, 1, 3, and 5 h after
dilution) to monitor particle size progression considering time and
dilution medium. The data of these experiments are summarized and
displayed in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Time-dependent DLS measurements of diluted N-TER peptide complexes
containing FluoNTC (white bars), NTC (weakly dashed bars), or miRNA-27a
(strongly dashed bars) characterized as the intensity-based particle
size (upper row) and PdI (bottom row). Final nucleic acid concentrations
are 100 nM, respectively. As dilution medium, RNase-free water (left),
zeta water (middle), or serum-free low glucose DMEM (right) is used.

In the first experiment, N-TER
peptide–nucleic acid complexes
are diluted with RNase-free water, which is used as a reference to
minimize the influence of additional ionic ambient conditions (Figure 3, left). It has to
be noted that RNase-free water is always used for preparation of the
standard N-TER peptide–nucleic acid complexes (650 nM). Despite
dilution, Figure 3 (top
left) demonstrates that the main particle fraction of 200–300
nm being also present initially in the standard N-TER peptide–nucleic
acid complexes (shown in Figure 2) is still preserved. However, other than the experiments
at high concentration, the intensity-based particle sizes of the diluted
DDS do not change significantly over time. This more stable behavior
might be attributed to a concentration-dependent effect by reducing
the probability of particle interactions at lower concentrations.39,43 PdI values vary between 0.2 and 0.4 strongly indicating some polydisperse
properties, which is additionally confirmed by relatively broad standard
deviations (SD; Figure 3, bottom left).

For the second dilution test, N-TER peptide–nucleic
acid
complexes are diluted with zeta water, which contains a defined ion
concentration (0.5 mM) of NaCl (Figure 3, middle). Again, the intensity-based results indicate
a size range of 200–300 nm independent of the progressed time.
Such particles represent the main particle fraction (Figure 3, middle above), which is also
present in the standard (Figure 2) and RNase-free water-diluted (Figure 3, top left) samples. Therefore, the obtained
results suggest that the ionic strength in the tested concentration
range do not affect the size of the main particle fraction over time.
The PdI values show, similar to the dilution with RNase-free water,
no time dependence, that is, a rather stable situation. However, unlike
before, the PdI values are slightly larger in the range of 0.3–0.7,
showing a slightly stronger polydispersity developing (Figure 3, middle bottom).

In
the third and last dilution step, N-TER peptide–nucleic
acid complexes are diluted with serum-free low glucose DMEM, which
is a commonly used cell culture medium and as such interesting for
potential in vitro studies to expose the peptide-based DDS in cell-incubating
conditions. In general, serum-free low glucose DMEM contains amino
acids, vitamins, and inorganic salts, which are expected to affect
the particle size and stability of the exposed N-TER peptide–nucleic
acid complexes, and in fact, this can be seen in Figure 3 (right). In contrast to the
previously shown DLS data regarding standard N-TER peptide–nucleic
acid complexes (Figure 2) and RNase-free water or zeta water diluted samples (Figure 3 left/middle), the results
using DMEM as the dilution medium clearly demonstrate significant
differences in monitoring the particle size and PdI over time (Figure 3, right). Particle
sizes of about 600–800 nm are detected immediately after dilution
with further increase up to 1 μm (Figure 3, top right). After 5 h, however, the particle
sizes of diluted N-TER peptide–nucleic acid complexes seem
to decrease under DMEM conditions. While the increase might be understood
in a time-dependent growth of the agglomerated on account of statistic
processes, the decrease at the end is unexpected. There might be two
possible explanations for this phenomenon: On the one hand, particle
agglomerates could achieve a maximum size and start to decay. On the
other hand, sedimentation of the bigger agglomerates might have started
while smaller agglomerates are still influenced more by the Brownian
motion, thus floating similar to before. This leads to a different
settling behavior, which should be tested and compared to either Stokes’
equation or hindered Stokes’ equation to clarify this. PdI
values clearly show the agglomeration tendency of the DMEM-diluted
DDS and considerable increase of polydispersity up to 0.7 after continuous
observations over 5 h (Figure 3, bottom right).

To assess whether the chosen dilution
medium (RNase-free water,
zeta water, or serum-free low glucose DMEM) influence the zeta potential
of N-TER peptide–nucleic acid complexes as well as the particle
size, ELS measurements are performed (Figure 4). In short, the zeta potential is a hypothetical
plane within the diffuse layer, which acts as the interface between
the charged particles moving in the electric field and the layer of
the dispersant around them. The results allow for the conclusion on
electrostatic stabilization to be made.43 The samples are diluted standard N-TER peptide–nucleic acid
complexes with various media resulting in 80 nM solutions. The data
of the results are summarized in Figure 4. The RNase-free water dilution serves again
as a reference to investigate the zeta potential of the diluted samples
without additional changes. The ELS results in Figure 4 (most left columns) for RNase-diluted N-TER
peptide–nucleic acid complexes exhibit positively charged zeta
potential values of about +25 to +30 mV. There is nearly no difference
for all the different nucleic acid systems, reflecting again the similarity
of different particle types.

Figure 4 ELS measurements of diluted N-TER peptide complexes
containing
FluoNTC (white bars), NTC (weakly dashed bars), or miRNA-27a (strongly
dashed bars) characterized as zeta potential. Final nucleic acid concentrations
are 80 nM, respectively. As dilution medium, RNase-free water, zeta
water, or serum-free low glucose DMEM are used.

N-TER peptide–nucleic acid complexes diluted in zeta
water
exhibit zeta potential values of about +25 mV as shown in Figure 4 (middle columns),
which is only slightly smaller compared to RNase-diluted samples.
As a consequence, it can be assumed that the conductivity of zeta
water, which is set to 50 μS/cm by adding NaCl, is not strongly
affecting the diffuse layer and changing the initial surface characteristics
of the sample.44

By using serum-free
low glucose DMEM for dilution, the ELS experiment
shows a strong change. A decrease of zeta potential from about +25
mV from the other down to +10 mV is observed (Figure 4, most right columns), which can be explained
by a higher conductivity of the cell culture medium DMEM. This is
related to an increase of ionic strength regarding DMEM (135 mM) in
comparison to zeta water (0.5 mM) because of the additionally charged
components (e.g., amino acids, vitamins, and inorganic salts), which
lead to compression of the diffuse layer, and as a consequence, the
zeta potential of N-TER peptide–nucleic acid complexes decreases.40,43,45

To summarize the stability
considerations followed from DLS and
ELS for diluted N-TER peptide–nucleic acid complexes (100 nM),
the recorded data of PdI-values clearly indicate polydisperse properties
of the samples, independent of the dilution medium (RNase-free water,
zeta water, or serum-free low glucose DMEM). However, the particle
size characterization highlights the influence of the chosen dispersant
on the detected main particle fraction. Dilution with dispersants
exhibiting very low ionic strength, such as RNase-free water or zeta
water, do not influence the particle size of the main particle fraction,
which is already present in the standard N-TER peptide–nucleic
acid complexes (650 nM). In addition, the particle sizes of the main
particle fraction remain largely unchanged over time. On the contrary,
DMEM-diluted samples show a significant increase of the particle size
as well as agglomeration tendency over time, which is related to higher
electrolyte concentrations in the dilution medium and thus, an increase
of ionic strength. The discussed findings of DLS measurements are
in accordance with the literature, which emphasize that agglomeration
is very prominent for DDS in biological media. Enhanced electrostatic
interactions and electrolyte adsorptions result in increased particle
size diameters and degree of polydispersity.43,45,46

Furthermore, ELS measurements have
contributed to obtain important
information about zeta potential properties and colloidal stability
of N-TER peptide–nucleic acid complexes, depending on the applied
dilution medium (RNase-free water, zeta water, or serum-free low glucose
DMEM). The recorded data show positively charged zeta potential values,
which can be attributed to the positively charged lysine residues
in the hydrophilic N-TER peptide sequence, thus promoting electrostatic
interactions with negatively charged nucleic acids and beyond that
with negatively charged cell membranes. Guidelines for classifying
and predicting colloidal stability of nanoparticulate DDS are available
considering ±0 to 10 mV as highly unstable while ±10 to
20, ±20 to 30, and >±30 mV are classified as relatively,
moderately, and highly stable, respectively.43,44,47 After dilution with RNase-free water and
zeta water, the obtained zeta potential values (+25 to +30 mV) suggest
a DDS with moderately stable colloidal stability, which is in contrast
to the DLS measurements suggesting a polydisperse DDS. While zeta
potential provides information about electrostatic repulsive forces,
colloidal stability is also influenced by attractive interaction forces
including hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic and van der Waals forces.36,43,48 Surface properties including
surface charge and hydrophobicity can strongly affect stability and
provide an explanation for the agglomeration properties of N-TER peptide-based
DDS.49,50

Morphology and Adhesion Analysis
DLS and ELS are widely
used techniques for physicochemical characterization to determine
the particle size, polydispersity, and zeta potential. However, DDS,
such as N-TER peptide–nucleic acid complexes, are often polydisperse
and for this purpose, it is advisable to apply additional methods
for the particle size and morphology analysis.28,46 The AFM technique is therefore used here to clarify the morphology
of the structures made from N-TER peptide–nucleic acid complexes.
In addition, adhesion behavior of the complexes is estimated for chemically
modified substrates (Si-wafers) using bovine serum albumin (BSA) or
polystyrol (PS) coatings, which exhibit hydrophilic or hydrophobic
surface properties, respectively. The exemplary height images in Figure 5 reveal the presence
of particles but most often agglomerates are found on all investigated
substrates including uncoated, BSA- or PS-coated Si-wafers. The results
clarify that smaller particles of about 100–300 nm are present
on all substrates (marked as size profiles 1 in Figure 5), which can be related to be the primary
particles also noted in the DLS measurements right after fabrication.
These particles represent the smallest building unit, which later
form toward much larger size agglomerates even exceeding μm
(marked as size profiles 2 in Figure 5). These findings clearly prove that N-TER peptide-based
DDS have pronounced propensity to agglomerate. The described phenomenon
of particle agglomeration has already been discussed for other CPP
by Lochmann et al.39 Regarding the particle
shape, it can be demonstrated that the primary particles exhibit slightly
elongated and very flat disk-shaped geometries based upon aspect ratios
(AR, height-to-width relationship), which are assessed from the size
cross section profiles 1 in Figure 5.49,51,52 Remarkable is the fact that the primary particles only achieve very
low heights (30–50 nm) compared to very broad corresponding
widths (100–300 nm), which can be explained by a strong effort
to bind as much as possible of the surface of the particles to the
substrates. The driving forces for this phenomenon are probably electrostatic
interactions between the negative surface charge of uncoated or BSA-coated
Si-wafers and partially positively charged N-TER peptide–nucleic
acid complexes. In comparison with uncoated Si-wafers, BSA coating
leads to a slight improvement of AR from 0.1 to 0.2, which is related
to a reduced negative charge density and thus reduced electrostatic
interactions of the samples with the substrate.53−55 Although BSA
exhibits a negative net charge depending on the current pH conditions
(pH 5–7), some amino acids of the protein sequence still exhibit
positive charges.53,54,56 On the one hand, electrostatic interactions are promoted with the
negatively charged Si-wafer to enable BSA coating, but on the other
hand, the negative charge density of the Si-wafer after BSA coating
is reduced, resulting in an improvement of the height-to-width relationship.
If the interaction forces between the sample and the substrate surface
are too strong, the morphology of the sample might be changed, thus
affecting the AR. On the contrary, the electrostatic interactions
have to be strong enough to prevent detachment of the sample during
the scanning process.28,54

Figure 5 AFM height and corresponding phase images
with size cross section
profiles of N-TER peptide–NTC complexes on silicon wafers with
different chemical modifications. The scale is 0.5 μm.

Furthermore, the influence of
different chemical pretreatments
on adhesion behavior of the N-TER peptide–nucleic acid complexes
can be estimated. Surface properties of the substrates can have an
important impact on the extent of adhesion.57 As demonstrated in the exemplary height images of Figure 5, N-TER peptide–NTC
complexes adhere to all used silicon substrates, independent of hydrophilic
(uncoated, BSA-coated) or hydrophobic (PS-coated) surface properties.
In contrast to hydrophobic surfaces, the aqueous sample solution has
spread evenly across the hydrophilic surfaces, showing good wettability.
Additionally, the interaction forces between the sample and the hydrophilic/hydrophobic
substrates must have been strong enough to withstand the forces occurring
during the washing with RNase-free water after incubation, which is
necessary to remove the siRNA dilution buffer. Interestingly, the
molecular structure of the amphipathic N-TER peptide, containing hydrophobic
and hydrophilic amino acids, seems to be responsible for the adhesion
on hydrophilic as well as hydrophobic substrate surfaces.34,58 The hydrophobic amino acid sequence is composed of glycine (G),
alanine (A), leucine (L), phenylalanine (F), methionine (M), tryptophan
(W), proline (P), and valine (V), whereas the hydrophilic amino acids
of the peptide are divided, on the one hand, into a polar class containing
serine (S), threonine T, and glutamine Q and, on the other hand, into
a charged class containing lysine (K) and arginine (R).59,60 Adhesion of the N-TER peptide–nucleic acid complexes on the
hydrophilic substrates suggests electrostatic interactions predominantly
driven by the positively charged lysine and arginine residues of the
peptide. Conversely, the hydrophobic amino acids allow interactions
with the hydrophobic PS-coated surface. This adhesion phenomenon of
amphipathic peptides on hydrophilic silicon substrates or hydrophobic
PS is in agreement with the literature, which supports the different
bonding mechanisms (electrostatic or hydrophobic interactions).34,58

In addition to morphology and adhesion studies, phase imaging
is
used as an additional tool for characterizing surface properties and
distinguishing between different materials.61,62 In the case of BSA, the coated silicon substrate reveals an irregular
surface while the PS coating results in porous surface properties.
The phase contrast results are used to distinguish between hard (dark)
and soft (bright) surface areas. The recorded results in Figure 5 clearly reveal that
N-TER peptide–NTC complexes are softer compared to the used
substrate materials including uncoated, BSA-, or PS-coated silicon.

Conclusions
The physicochemical investigations using DLS,
ELS, and AFM techniques
are very important to develop a fundamental understanding about complexation
behavior between the amphipathic peptides and nucleic acids. Even
though zeta potential values should provide decent stabilization,
AFM investigations in the tapping mode qualitatively confirm a state
of agglomeration of N-TER peptide-based DDS, which is already suggested
by DLS data. Furthermore, AFM enables to estimate adhesion behavior
of our N-TER peptide–nucleic acid complexes on different chemically
modified substrates, exhibiting hydrophilic or hydrophobic surface
properties. AFM phase contrast images confirm soft sample properties
of the N-TER peptide–nucleic acid complexes on the used substrate
materials. It is further demonstrated that all three nucleic acids,
namely, miRNA-27a, NTC, and FluoNTC, exhibit similar complexation
possibilities with the N-TER peptide. With respect to successful miRNA-based
medicines, physicochemical properties of peptide-based DDS for nucleic
acids might influence the therapeutic efficiency of miRNAs on the
cellular level by promoting protection against enzymatic degradation,
cell membrane interaction, cell uptake, and intracellular release.
Therefore, future studies are planned in an in vitro cell culture
model to study the anti-adipogenic effect of miRNA-27a on adipogenesis
by applying our N-TER peptide-based DDS for nucleic acids.

Experimental
Section
Materials
The N-TER Nanoparticle siRNA Transfection
System from Sigma-Aldrich (Vienna, Austria) contains siRNA dilution
buffer and the N-TER peptide with the sequence GALFLGFLGAAGSTMGAWSQPKKKRKV.25,29 Three different nucleic acids from Dharmacon (GE Healthcare, Vienna,
Austria) were purchased and used as delivered to prepare complexes
with the N-TER peptide. double-stranded
miRNA mimic mmu-miR-27a-3p (miRNA-27a)
containing the sequence UUCACAGUGGCUAAGUUCCGC (MW 13454 g/mol) to
mimic the function of endogenous miRNAs

miRNA mimic negative control containing the sequence
UCACAACCUCCUAGAAAGAGUAGA (MW 14 074.31 g/mol) to act as a NTC
in miRNA mimic experiments

transfection control with Dy547 (FluoNTC)
containing the sequence CUCUUUCUAGGAGGUUGUGA 5′ Dy547 (MW 14 566.9
g/mol) to perform fluorescence experiments in vitro



RNase-free water (VWR, Vienna, Austria) was utilized
to prepare N-TER peptide complexes. For dilutions, RNase-free water,
zeta water, and DMEM containing 1 g/L d-glucose, referred
to as “low-glucose DMEM” (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Vienna, Austria), were used. Zeta water was prepared by using distilled
water adjusted with sodium chloride (NaCl) to a conductivity of 50
μS/cm (0.5 mM NaCl) and a pH of 5.5–6.0.30 The complex preparations were carried out under aseptic
conditions using a laminar flow box (Herasafe KS, Thermo Fisher Scientific).
The RNase AWAY (Sigma-Aldrich) decontamination reagent was used for
surface disinfection.

Sample Preparation
Stock solutions
of miRNA-27a, NTC,
or FluoNTC were prepared in RNase-free water and stored at −80
°C. After thawing, the stock solutions were diluted with RNase-free
water to 5 μM solutions followed by further dilution with the
siRNA dilution buffer to obtain 1.3 μM solutions. The N-TER
peptide was diluted with RNase-free water. The working solutions of
the N-TER peptide and miRNA-27a, NTC, or FluoNTC were intermixed using
equal volumes. The standard N-TER peptide–nucleic acid complexes
were incubated at ambient temperatures (about 23 °C) for 15–20
min containing finally a nucleic acid concentration of 650 nM. This
was followed by 5 min of sonication (Emmi-D100, EMAG Technologies,
Mörfelden-Walldorf, Germany). To obtain samples suitable for
the particle size (100 nM) and zeta potential (80 nM) measurements,
the standard N-TER peptide–nucleic acid complexes (650 nM)
were diluted either with RNase-free water, zeta water, or low glucose
DMEM.

Measurement Techniques
A Zetasizer Nano ZS from Malvern
Instruments (Malvern, UK) was employed to determine the particle size
by using DLS (intensity-based size distribution) and the zeta potential
using ELS technologies, respectively. The setup is equipped with a
green laser (532 nm). Particle size measurements were performed using
UVette cuvettes (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) at 25 °C with back-scattering
detection at 173°. The data processing model used for analysis
was general. In addition, the polydispersity was estimated using the
PdI implemented in the Malvern evaluation software. The zeta potential
was evaluated by using the Smoluchowsky approximation at 25 °C.
Clear folded capillary cells from Malvern Instruments were used. For
the DLS and the ELS, each sample condition was prepared in triplicates
as well as each measurement. All results are presented as mean values
± SD.

Using AFM, the topographies of particles were evaluated.
The investigations were performed with a FlexAFM atomic force microscope,
equipped with an Easyscan 2 controller (Nanosurf, Switzerland). Height
and phase images were recorded in the tapping mode using Tap300 Al-G
cantilevers (Budgetsensors, Sofia, Bulgaria). All recorded data were
processed and analyzed with the software package Gwyddion.31 All AFM measurements were performed under dry
conditions, that is, the samples were prepared onto either silicon
wafers containing a native oxide layer (about 1 nm) or glass substrates.
To clean, the substrates were treated with piranha solution (3:1 concentrated
H2SO4/30% H2O2), soaked
for 20 min, and rinsed thoroughly with deionized water making it highly
hydrophilic.32,33 Additionally, chemical modifications
of some of these substrates were achieved by coating the surfaces
with BSA or PS. To coat the substrates with BSA, a phosphate-buffered
saline solution containing 1 mg/mL BSA was applied and incubated for
15 min. The substrates were then rinsed with RNase-free water and
dried in air overnight. A film of PS was obtained by spin-coating
using tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution containing 5% (w/w) PS. The samples
of the N-TER peptide alone or complexed with nucleic acids were applied
by drop-casting immediately after preparation on the substrates and
incubated for 20 min. Afterward, the samples were rinsed with RNase-free
water to remove dried up siRNA dilution buffer residues and unbound/excess
complexes, followed by drying in air overnight.

The N-TER peptides
complexed with a FluoNTC were further evaluated
using fluorescence imaging and oil DIC optics (63×/1.4), both
present in the Zeiss Axio Observer (Göttingen, Germany). Filter
settings were chosen according to the absorption/emission spectra
(557 nm/570 nm) of the fluorescence marker Dy547. Because of the transmission
microscopy, glass substrates were utilized. Mounting the AFM on top
of the specimen holder of the Zeiss Axio Observer, this set up further
allows simultaneous imaging by AFM together with the fluorescent microscope
at the very same position, making combined investigations possible.
