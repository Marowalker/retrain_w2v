Glycosylation is ubiquitous throughout
the central nervous system
and altered following spinal cord injury (SCI). The glial scar that
forms following SCI is composed of several chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans,
which inhibit axonal regrowth. Cyclosporin-A (CsA), an immunosuppressive
therapeutic, has been proposed as a potential treatment after SCI.
We investigated CsA treatment in the spinal cord of healthy, contusion
injured, and injured CsA-treated rats. Lectin histochemistry using
fluorescently labeled lectins, SBA, MAA, SNA-I, and WFA, was performed
to identify the terminal carbohydrate residues of glycoconjugates
within the spinal cord. SBA staining decreased in gray and white matter
following spinal cord injury, whereas staining was increased at the
lesion site in CsA-treated animals, indicating an increase in galactose
and N-acetylgalactosamine terminal structures. No
significant changes in MAA were observed. WFA staining was abundant
in gray matter and observed to increase at the lesion site, in agreement
with increased expression of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans. SNA-I-stained
blood vessels in all spinal cord regions and dual staining identified
a subpopulation of astrocytes in the lesion site, which expressed
α-(2,6)-sialic acid. Glycosylation were altered in injured spinal
cord treated with CsA, indicating that glycosylation and alteration
of particular carbohydrate structures are important factors to consider
in the examination of the environment of the spinal cord after injury.

Introduction
In spinal cord injury (SCI), the primary
mechanical trauma is caused
by direct physical compression of the spinal cord by fractured and
displaced bone fragments. Blood vessels are crushed, causing microhemorrhages,
neural cell membranes are broken, and axons are damaged, leading to
a loss of functional connections.1,2 Secondary injury
adds to the complexity of SCI. Neuronal destruction causes the release
of toxic chemicals that attack the neighboring tissue via excitotoxicity
and often leads to a wave of apoptosis and free radical-induced lipid
oxidation.3,4 Inflammation plays an important role in
early and late stages of SCI.5,6 Cells of the immune
system migrate from the periphery through the damaged blood–brain
barrier and join the resident glial cells within the spinal cord.
A fluid-filled cyst forms at the site of injury. Many astrocytes become
hypertrophic and adopt a reactive phenotype.7 Reactive astrocytes begin to secrete inhibitory extracellular matrix
(ECM) molecules, including several chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans
(CSPGs), and migrate to the lesion site to build a barrier known as
the glial scar,8 which produces a physical
and chemical barrier and stops damaged and severed axons from traversing
the site of injury to unscarred spinal regions where they could potentially
regenerate and reconnect functional spinal circuits.9,10 The molecular organization of the scar and the production of inhibitory
molecules by astrocytes are contributing factors for regenerative
failure after SCI.7,8,11

Glycosylation is ubiquitous throughout the central nervous system
(CNS) and plays critical roles in development and normal cellular
function. Sialic acids are charged residues that often terminate mammalian
cell surface structures, ECM glycoconjugates, and glycolipids. Sialic
acids fulfil important functions in the CNS as critical components
of gangliosides and the repeating units of polysialic acid.12 Terminal galactose (Gal) residues interact with
galectins (receptors found throughout the cell) on cell surfaces and
in the ECM, and exert biological effects. For example, galectin-1
is expressed by reactive astrocytes and after SCI appears to have
a neuroprotective effect mediated by reactive astrocytes.13 Variously sulfated N-acetylgalactosamine
(GalNAc) residues comprise one of the two residues of the repeating
units of chondroitin sulfate (CS) chains on CSPGs, with the structures
and sulfation pattern of the CS repeating units determining the function.
For example, chondroitin-4,6-sulfate (also known as CS E) is potently
inhibitory to axonal growth.14 Previously,
we have shown in vitro that neuronal glycosylation in an injured environment
returns toward normal with chondroitinase ABC treatment.15 Thus, a return to healthy ECM and cellular glycosylation
after repair would coincide with resumed normal function in the spinal
cord.

Many therapeutic strategies have been proposed in the
treatment
of SCI.16 Cyclosporin-A (CsA) is an immunosuppressive
cyclic peptide that has been shown to have neuroprotective properties
by inhibiting calcineurin and the mitrochondrial permeability transition
pore, reducing lipid peroxidation, and releasing neurotrophic factors.17 Additionally, it is known to induce growth-associated
protein-43 (GAP-43) expression, which is involved in process extension
of neurons.18 Treatment with CsA leads
to improved functional recovery after SCI in rats, and it is frequently
combined with neural transplantation to avoid tissue rejection.19,20 However, the effect of CsA treatment on tissue and cell glycosylation
is unknown.

In this study, we investigated glycosylation in
vitro using normal
(primary) astrocytes and an astrocyte cell line, Neu7, that overexpresses
CSPGs. We also examined glycosylation in vivo within uninjured rat
spinal cord, injured spinal cord, and injured spinal cord treated
with CsA. In particular, we selected a panel of lectins, carbohydrate-binding
proteins, to elucidate the presence, localization, and potential alteration
of structures containing sialic acid, Gal, and GalNAc residues, including
CS, in the tissues of the CsA treatment compared to normal and no
treatment. To clarify potential interactions and functions of the
altered glycosylation expression and their roles in the documented
effects of CsA treatment after SCI, we also explored the relationship
between axonal growth, CS expression, astrocytes, and sialylation
expression using a combination of lectin histochemistry and immunohistochemical
strategies.

Results and Discussion
Cells are coated with a layer
of carbohydrates of complex structure,
which facilitates the interaction of the cells with other cells and
with their environment. Changes in carbohydrate expression can be
examined in different tissues (e.g., injured versus uninjured spinal
cord tissue) using lectins. Lectin histochemistry for both cells and
tissues was also carried out in the presence of haptenic sugars. A
reduction in intensity of lectin staining was observed for all lectin
staining (not shown), which confirmed the carbohydrate-mediated binding
of lectins.21 This study encompasses a
multidisciplinary chemical biology approach to studying tissue regeneration
after SCI.

Lectin Staining of Astrocytes in Vitro
To initially
screen for differences in carbohydrate expression related to CSPGs
and sialylation, protein extracts from two types of astrocytes, primary
and Neu7, were made, total cell lysates and extracts enriched for
membrane (hydrophobic) and cytosolic (hydrophilic) proteins. Neu7
cells overproduce the inhibitory CSPGs including NG2, the CS-56 antigen,
and versican and is used to simulate a reactive astrocyte phenotype.22 These protein preparations were fluorescently
labeled and incubated on lectin microarrays presenting a panel of
five lectins with specificity for terminal Gal and GalNAc residues
(SBA and WFA) and sialic acid (MAL-I, MAL-II, and SNA-I) (Figure 1).

binding of fluorescently labeled protein extracts to printed lectins
on a microarray surface where Ast_Lys is the total lysate from primary
astrocytes, Ast_Cyt is the cytosolic (hydrophilic) protein-enriched
extract from primary astrocytes, Ast_Mem is the membrane (hydrophobic)
protein-enriched extract from primary astrocytes, Neu7_Lys is the
total lysate from Neu7 cells, Neu7_Cyt is the cytosolic (hydrophilic)
protein-enriched extract from Neu7 cells, and Neu7_Mem is the membrane
(hydrophobic) protein-enriched extract from Neu7 cells. Graph represents
the mean of three replicate experiments (except for duplicate experiments
for Neu7_Mem binding to MAL-II), with each experiment the median of
six individual replicates. Error bars represent ±1 standard deviation
of the mean of the three experiments.

From comparison of astrocyte and Neu7 cell lysates, it is
clear
that there was an increased expression of Gal and GalNAc terminal
residues in Neu7 cell lysates as indicated by increased SBA and WFA
binding compared to primary astrocytes (Table 1). This is in agreement with the overproduction
of CSPGs by Neu7. Similarly, MAL-I and MAL-II binding to Neu7 cell
lysates was increased compared to primary astrocyte lysates, which
indicated an increased expression of α-(2,3)-linked sialic acid
(Table 1). However,
binding to SNA-I was similar for both cell lysates, which indicated
a similar expression of α-(2,6)-linked sialic acid (Table 1). Relative lectin-binding
intensities of the cells’ cytosolic protein-enriched extracts
were largely in agreement with the cells’ lysates, but the
lectin-binding intensities of the membrane protein-enriched extracts
differed (Figure 1).
Binding to MAL-I was increased for Neu7 cells compared to primary
astrocytes, whereas binding intensities to MAL-II was similar for
the membrane protein-enriched extracts for both cell types, indicating
a potentially modest increase of α-(2,3)-linked sialic acid
expression in Neu7 cells compared to primary astrocytes. On the other
hand, the binding intensity to SNA-I was greater for the membrane
protein-enriched extracts of primary astrocytes compared to Neu7 cells.

a For histochemical inhibition experiments,
lectins were co-incubated with 100 mM of the haptenic sugar and for
lectin microarray printing, lectins were co-incubated in 1 mM of the
haptenic sugar.

The enrichment
process used here for cytosolic and membrane protein
fractionation is based on relative hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity.
Therefore, cell surface bound hydrophilic proteins such as CSPGs and
mucins can be extracted to the “cytosolic” fractions,
so the protein membrane fractionation in this case can only be taken
as an enrichment and may not be truly completely representative of
the cell surface protein and proteoglycan population.

Thus,
the two cell types were then assessed for more specific surface
glycosylation changes by cytohistochemisty on the intact cells using
the fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated lectins SBA, MAA,
WFA, and SNA-I (Table 1). The Maackia amurensis agglutinin
(MAA) contains both MAL-I and MAL-II lectins and, as both have binding
specificity for terminal α-(2,3)-linked sialic acid, MAA was
used in place of MAL-I and -II for histochemistry experiments.23 Although the differences in secreted CSPGs between
primary astrocytes and Neu7 cells have been characterized, to our
knowledge, the cell surface glycosylation has not been previously
profiled. Lectin histochemistry revealed a greater expression of terminal
GalNAc (SBA staining) and/or Gal residues and α-(2,3)-linked
sialylation (MAA staining) on Neu7 cells compared to primary astrocytes
(Figure 2A–E).
The greater SBA and MAA binding of Neu7 cells compared to primary
astrocytes was in agreement with the findings from the lectin microarray
profiling of the cell protein extracts. However, there was equivalent
expression of α-(2,6)-linked sialic acid on primary astroctyes
and Neu7 cells as indicated by SNA-I binding (Figure 2A,F,G), which was in agreement with the SNA-I
binding of cell lysates on the lectin microarray. WFA binding in vitro
was the same in primary astrocytes and Neu7 cells (Figure 2A,H,I), in contrast to the
findings of the protein extracts on the lectin microarray. However,
as has been noted above, protein extractions are not completely representative
of the molecules actually present on the cell surface, so the cytochemistry
observations are more indicative of the cell surface expression. It
is notable that the lectins SBA and WFA did not have the same binding
pattern to Neu7 cells and primary astrocytes, which indicated that
the lectins favored binding to different carbohydrate structures or
presentations. Both SBA and WFA have been previously characterized
as having similar binding specificities and affinities for terminal
α- and β-linked GalNAc and Gal residues.24 Although it is known that WFA additionally binds to CS
and is frequently used as a histochemical marker for perineuronal
nets (PNNs), the exact target structure(s) and sulfation pattern(s)
to which this lectin binds in CS is not currently known.25,26 Thus, it is likely that the additional structures recognized by
WFA on the primary astrocytes cell surface are components of CS. Expression
of α-(2,6)-linked sialic acid is greater compared to α-(2,3)-linked
sialic acid on the primary astrocyte surface.27 Apart from α-(2,8)-linked polysialic acid, α-(2,3)-linked
sialic acid is typically predominant in the nervous system, and there
is very little α-(2,6)-sialylation.27 The presence of α-(2,6)-sialylation on the astrocyte cell
surface may be a characteristic of this cell type or the cell type
under certain conditions, such as in culture.

Lectin Staining of Spinal
Cord Cryosections
Lectin
histochemistry of the spinal cord tissue from the three animal groups,
uninjured, injured, and injured treated with CsA, were examined. The
gray and white matter of the uninjured group had a higher intensity
of SBA binding overall compared to the same two regions in the injured
and CsA-treated groups (Figure 3A–E,G,H), which indicated a decreased expression of
nonsulfated terminal Gal and/or GalNAc residues in the injured and
treated tissues compared to healthy tissues. In addition, the SBA-binding
intensity of the healthy gray matter was approximately 3 times that
of the uninjured white matter. At the lesion site, a slight increase
in SBA intensity was observed in the gray matter and lesion site of
the CsA-treated group compared to the injured group (Figure 3A,F,I). Lozza et al. (2009)
showed that SBA stains neuronal cell bodies and not glial cells in
young and aged rat spinal cords.28 Although
the binding of SBA was significantly higher in Neu7 astrocytes in
vitro compared to normal primary astrocytes, the same binding profile
for this lectin was not observed in the injured spinal cord tissue
compared to uninjured. This finding highlights the importance of cautious
interpretation when relying on in vitro data alone for glycosylation
analysis.

white matter (B, D, G), gray matter (C, E, H), and lesion site (F,

Scale bar = 50 μm.

MAA lectin staining exhibited no significant change in intensity
in the gray and white matter of the injured and CsA-treated group
compared to the uninjured group (Figure 4A–E,G,H), and no overall difference
in MAA intensity was observed between the lesions sites of the injured
and CsA-treated groups (Figure 4A,F,I). However, consistent with the greater MAA binding to
Neu7 cells compared to primary astrocytes, there was an observed trend
of slightly increased MAA binding to the injured and CsA-treated tissue
overall compared to uninjured, with the intensity of gray matter and
lesion site of CsA-treated tissues approximately twice that of the
same areas in injured tissues. There is an increased expression of
sialylation, sulfation, and fucosylation in tissue and on cell surfaces
overall associated with inflammation, which facilitates interactions
with selectins, although detailed studies of structural changes over
time have not been undertaken in neural tissue.29 Previously, it has been shown that neurite outgrowth from
cerebellar neurons was enhanced by the presence of α-(2,3)-sialylation
on glial CD24 via lectin-like binding to the L1 adhesion molecule.30

Figure 4 Integrated density of MAA lectin in spinal cord slices.
Graph shows
integrated density of MAA lectin staining in the white matter, gray
matter, and lesion site sampling regions within uninjured, injured,
and injured spinal cords treated with CsA (A). Mean ± SEM. *P < 0.05. Photomicrographs show MAA histochemical staining
in the white matter (B, D, G), gray matter (C, E, H), and lesion site
(F, I) of uninjured, injured, and injured spinal cords treated with
CsA. Scale bar = 50 μm.

There was also no statistically significant difference in
SNA-I
staining intensity for the white and gray matter between groups (Figure 5A–E,G,H).
Although an increase in intensity was observed at the lesion site
of the CsA-treated group compared to the injured group, which indicated
increased expression of α-(2,6)-linked sialic acid, this was
also not a significant change (Figure 5A,F,I). The morphology of the cells in SNA-I-stained
tissue in the gray and white matter of CsA-treated group appeared
to resemble glial cells (particularly astrocytes). For this reason,
dual SNA-I lectin and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunohistochemical
staining was carried out on the injured and CsA-treated group to determine
if co-localization could be observed between SNA-I and astrocytes.
In the tissue, SNA-I bound to the endothelial cells of blood vessels
in all regions examined, as expected,31 and to only a particular subpopulation of astrocytes in the lesion
of the injured (Figure 6A,B) and CsA-treated groups (Figure 6C,D) at the lesion site, which indicated that a subpopulation
of astrocytes expressed α-(2,6)-sialylation. It is well known
that GFAP expression increases throughout the lesion border in response
to injury.32,33 The number of astrocytes have
been previously reported to increase at the lesion site of CsA-treated
animals compared to untreated injured animals at 3 weeks after injury.18 Previously in a study of rat brain injury, both
MAA and SNA-I staining was increased in the injured tissue compared
to sham-operated control, but neither lectin staining co-localized
with astrocyte immunoreactivity. However, polysialic acid did co-localize
with both microglia and astrocytes, whereas SNA-I and MAA both co-localized
with Iba-1 immunoreactivity.34 In our study,
SNA-I also stained other glial cells aside from astrocytes within
the lesion areas, as many stained cells were observed to surround
those co-localized with GFAP. Since GFAP does not stain all of the
cellular processes of astrocytes, this may be the reason for the SNA-I
staining surrounding GFAP-positive astrocytes.35 SNA-I also stained neurons in the lesion. The expression
of the abnormal α-(2,6)-linked sialic acid motif has been reported
on the neuronal cell surface in an in vitro injury model environment.15 Reactive astrocytes are more abundant in the
spinal cord lesion at later survival times of 7–28 days and
mainly surround and enclose tissue with phagocytic macrophages and
activated microglia.36 Although we cannot
confirm that the astrocyte subpopulation expressing α-(2,6)-linked
sialylation are reactive astrocytes, this subpopulation was more frequent
at the lesion border in the untreated tissue (Figure 6A), whereas this subpopulation was more dispersed
in the CsA-treated lesion area (Figure 6B). In an effort to identify which structure on the
astrocyte subpopulation surface may have been modified with α-(2,6)-sialic
acid, dual staining by SNA-I and βI-integrin was carried out.
There appeared to be some sparse evidence of co-localization observed
(Figure 7). Different
glycosylation of receptors alters the signaling response induced in
cells after binding to ligands and may serve to regulate signaling
functions in vivo. Sialylation and galactosylation of the N-linked
oligosaccharides on intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) enhanced
the signaling response in mouse astrocytes.37 The expression of α-(2,6)-sialylation has been previously
observed on necrotic and apoptotic cells.38 The β1 integrin is expressed ubiquitously and can pair with
at least 12 different α subunits to bind different ligands and
induce a signaling response. Variable glycosylation of β1 integrin
alters the binding and signaling responses39 and α-(2,6)-sialylation of β1 integrin has been shown
to block binding to Gal-3 and protect colon carcinoma cells against
apoptosis.40 However, in our study, we
were unable to co-localize SNA-I and β1 integrin staining, suggesting
that a different receptor or structure was modified on the astrocyte
subpopulation expressing α-(2,6)-sialylation in the lesion.

Although similar binding
of WFA was observed in vitro between normal
astrocytes and Neu7 cells in our study, WFA lectin staining was significantly
increased in the gray matter compared to the white matter of the uninjured
tissues, at approximately 10 times greater magnitude. The uninjured
gray matter was significantly greater than the gray matter in both
the injured and CsA-treated animal groups, whereas the WFA-stained
uninjured white matter was significantly less compared to the white
matter in the injured and CsA-treated animal group (Figures 8A–E and 9). A significant increase in WFA binding was also observed
at the lesion site compared to gray and white matter in both the injured
and CsA-treated groups, with less binding in the gray matter and lesion
site of the CsA-treated group compared to the injured group (Figure 8A,D–I). Increased
expression of CSPGs has been shown within perineuronal nets (PNNs)
in CNS-lesioned tissue.41 In a conditional
Sox9 knockout, reduction of CSPGs within PNNs has been shown.42 The CSPGs are also present in the white matter
of the spinal cord.43 After SCI, these
CSPGs are elevated and cause the inhibition of axonal growth.44 Previously, ChABC was injected into the spinal
cord near the lesion, resulting in degradation of the CSPGs, which
promoted the sprouting of the injured dorsal column axons and functional
recovery and also reduced the WFA staining of PNNs.45 In our study, WFA staining in the lesion site of the CsA-treated
tissue was higher in comparison to the gray and white matter. WFA
staining at the injury was much lower in the CsA-treated group compared
to the injured group with no treatment, indicating that CsA may have
an effect on CS expression. WFA staining is used to stain PNNs, which
wrap around neuronal cell bodies or neurons, as well as other CSPGs
present.25 Dual WFA lectin and GAP-43 immunohistochemical
staining was carried out on the injured (Figure 8A,B) and CsA-treated groups (Figure 8C,D) at the lesion site to
assess the relationship between neurons and WFA. Although both markers
stained adjacent and closely related cells, no co-localization of
WFA and GAP-43 was observed. The dual lectin and immunohistochemistry
images indicated tissue remodeling in the lesion of the CsA-treated
tissue compared to injured tissue (Figures 7–10), supporting
the idea that CsA treatment reduced the formation of the glial scar
at the lesion 3 weeks after injury.

As the removal of PNNs is associated with a return
to plasticity
of the neurons and functional recovery, both CsA-treated and injured
tissue groups were stained for the presence of neurogranin.46 Neurogranin (RC3, BICKS) is a neuron-specific
calmodulin-binding protein kinase C substrate found in the neuronal
cell body, dendrites, and axons and can be associated with neuronal
plasticity.47 Although dual staining with
WFA and antineurogranin antibody did not reveal any co-localization
in the injured tissue group (Figure 10A–C), there did appear to be some co-localization
in the CsA group (Figure 10D,E), providing further evidence of the beneficial treatment
with CsA.

Many studies have been carried out where CsA administration
caused
functional recovery. The neuroprotective effects of CsA have been
well documented17,18 and this drug inhibits oxidative
free radicals and stabilizes the injury environment. The best functional
improvement was seen in animals that had CsA administered 6 h after
injury,48 and CsA treatment has been shown
to increase neuronal survival and inhibit demyelination when administered
within a day after SCI.17,19 When CsA was administered
4 days after injury, after the primary wave of injury had passed,
functional improvement was also observed 3 weeks after injury.18 However, CsA treatment does not always show
functional recovery due to calcineurin present in the lesion, which
inhibits CsA treatment.49

In this
study, we have shown that glycosylation was altered in
injured rat spinal cord with CsA treatment compared to injured tissue
with no treatment. Although the overall tissue glycosylation did not
return to normal conditions, CsA treatment from 4 days to 3 weeks
after injury did appear to significantly lower the CSPG expression
in the CsA-treated lesion compared to injured tissue and also indicated
tissue remodeling. In addition, a subpopulation of astrocytes localized
in the lesion expressed α-(2,6)-linked sialylation, and these
were also present in the CsA-treated lesion tissue. These alterations
in glycosylation may contribute to the functional improvements previously
observed for CsA treatment. This study supports the inclusion of glycosylation,
a critical component of the CNS, as an important aspect in future
research on CNS injury and regeneration to provide a more complete
perspective on successful molecular repair and remodeling strategies.

Cell Culture
Primary
cerebral astrocytes for immunocytochemistry
were obtained from P2 Sprague–Dawley rat pups and were purified
and cultured as previously described.15,50 For protein
extracts, primary astrocytes were prepared from spinal cords isolated
from 3–4-day-old postnatal Sprague–Dawley rats. Spinal
cords were isolated by minor modification of the “Ejection
method”.51 Briefly, after decapitation,
a transverse cut was made at the lower lumbar region of the spine
and spinal cords were flushed through the spinal canal using 19-gauge
needle attached to a syringe filled with Hanks’ balanced salt
solution. The spinal cords
were transferred immediately to Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM) with high glucose supplemented with 1% penicillin and
streptomycin (P/S) on ice. Spinal cords were transferred to a Petri
dish containing the same media and meninges were gently peeled under
microdissection microscope. Spinal tissues were chopped into fine
(approximately 1 mm) pieces and digested using 1% trypsin–EDTA
solution at 37 °C for 15–20 min. Trypsin activity was
inhibited using DMEM with high glucose supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum and 1% P/S and digested tissue was triturated by passing
it through various sizes of needles (18–23 gauge). Digested
tissue was expelled through a cell strainer filter (70 μm mesh
size, Falcon) to eliminate clumped cells or undigested tissue.

Neu7 astrocytes (generously provided from Professor James Fawcett52) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10%
horse serum, 1% l-glutamine, and 1% P/S at 37 °C in
a 5% humidified CO2 atmosphere. Primary astrocytes and
Neu7 astrocytes were seeded at a density of 10 000 cells onto
sterile coverslips in a 12-well tray and grown for 4 days in vitro.

Spinal Cord Injury
Female Sprague–Dawley rats
(Charles River UK Ltd, Margate, U.K.) weighing between 220 and 225
g were used in this study. The rats were housed with a 12 h light/dark
cycle in a temperature-controlled room. Food and water were provided
ad libitum. All animal experiments were carried out in accordance
with the Council Directive 2010/63EU of the European Parliament. All
housing and surgical procedures carried out in this study were approved
by the Animal Care Research Ethics Committee at the National University
of Ireland, Galway, and the Health and the Health Products Regulatory
Authority. Nine female Sprague–Dawley rats were used in this
study. Three animals were used as control (uninjured) rats and six
rats received a SCI. Prior to surgery, the rats were weighted and
preoperative analgesia, Buprenorphine (0.1–0.025 mg/kg, FortDodge
Animal Health Ltd), was delivered intraperitoneally (IP). The rats
were anesthetized by IP injection of ketamine and xylazine (100 and
10 mg/kg, respectively), following which a laminectomy was performed
at T8–T10. The injured animals received a 200 kilodyne moderate
contusion injury at T9 using an Infinite Horizon Impactor Device (Precision
Systems and Instrumentation, Lexington, KY). The muscle and skin was
sutured with absorbable suture material (Vicryl, 4 metric) and animals
kept warm on a heated blanket until fully recovered from intervention.
Each animal received a subcutaneous injection of 5–10 mg/kg
Enrofloxacin (Baytril 5%, Bayer) antibiotic once daily for a minimum
period of a week. Pain relief was provided by administering buprenorphine
(Torbugesic, FortDodge Animal Health Ltd.) at 0.1–0.25 mg/kg
twice daily for 7 days after surgery. Saline solution (3.5 mL) was
administered subcutaneously for 3 days following surgery. Bladders
were manually expressed twice daily from the day of injury.

CsA Administration
The six injured animals were randomly
divided into two groups: CsA-treated group (n = 3)
and control group (n = 3). A subcutaneous injection
of 5 mg/kg CsA (Sandimmun, Sandoz) was administered 4 days after injury
to the CsA-treated group and every day thereafter for the duration
of the experiment.

Tissue Processing
Three weeks from
the time of injury,
all animals were deeply anesthetized by IP injection of sodium pentobarbital
(50 mg/kg) and perfused transcardially with saline followed by 4%
paraformaldehyde in 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (PBS).
Spinal cords were dissected out, postfixed overnight with 4% paraformaldehyde,
immersed in 30% sucrose overnight, and frozen in liquid nitrogen-chilled
isopentane. Spinal cords were cryosectioned transversely at 20 μm
thickness in a rostral to caudal direction.

Cell Protein Extractions
and Fluorescent Labeling
Primary
astrocytes and Neu7 cells (5 × 106 cells/mL) were
lysed to make total protein lysate in a radioimmunoprecipitation assay
(RIPA) buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.02% sodium azide,
0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate,
pH 8.0) with complete protease inhibitor cocktail, EDTA-free (1:100),
phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (1:50), and PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor
cocktail (1:10). The cells were also fractionated using the Mem-PER
Plus membrane protein extraction kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) into
membrane (hydrophobic) and cytosolic (hydrophilic) protein-enriched
fractions according to manufacturer’s instructions. The protein
concentrations of the total cell lysate, cytosolic protein fraction,
and membrane protein fraction was determined using a Pierce BCA assay
kit and a BSA standard. Protein preparations were then aliquoted and
stored at −80 °C until further use.

Protein extracts
(200 μg) were labeled with AF555 (λex = 555
nm, λem = 580 nm) in 250 mM sodium borate, pH 8.3,
in the dark, essentially as previously described.53 Briefly, 1 mg of AF555 was dissolved in 100 μL dimethylsulfoxide
and 5 μL of the dissolved dye was added to each sample in a
final volume of approximately 300 μL and incubated at 25 °C
for 2 h in the dark at room temperature. Labeled protein samples were
then purified and buffer exchanged in PBS using a 3 kDa MWCO centrifugal
filters. These protein samples were quantified for protein content
and substitution according to manufacturer’s instructions and
stored in the dark at 4 °C until further use.

Lectin Microarray
Construction, Incubation, and Data Extraction
A panel of
five unlabeled pure lectins, MAL-I, MAL-II, SBA, WFA,
and SNA-I, were prepared at 0.5 mg/mL in PBS, pH 7.4, supplemented
with 1 mM of the appropriate haptenic sugar (Table 1). The lectins were printed at approximately
1 nL per feature on Nexterion Slide H microarray slides using a sciFLEXARRAYER
S3 piezoelectric printer (Scienion AG, Berlin, Germany) as previously
described.53 Each microarray slide contained
eight replicate subarrays, with each lectin spotted in replicates
of six per subarray. To ensure complete conjugation, these slides
were then incubated in a humidity chamber overnight at room temperature.
Residual functional groups were deactivated by incubation in 100 mM
ethanolamine in 50 mM sodium borate, pH 8.0, for 1 h at room temperature.
Each slide was washed with PBS, pH 7.4, containing 0.05% Tween-20
three times for 3 min per wash, once with PBS, centrifuged dry (450g, 5 min), and stored at 4 °C with desiccant until
use.

Prior to use, the lectin microarray slides were allowed
to equilibrate to room temperature for 30 min with desiccant. The
microarrays were protected from light throughout the procedure. Fluorescently
labeled protein samples were diluted in Tris-buffered saline (TBS)
supplemented with Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions (TBS; 20
mM Tris–HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2), pH 7.2, with 0.05% Tween-20 (TBS-T) for incubation on the
microarray slides. Initially, two fluorescently labeled protein samples
were titrated (1–10 μg/mL) to determine the optimal concentration
for signal-to-background ratio. For triplicate experiments, the optimal
concentration of 2 μg/mL of each labeled sample in TBS-T was
incubated on three separate microarray slides. For incubations, 70
μL of each diluted sample was applied to each well of the gasket
slide, sandwiched with the lectin microarray in an incubation cassette
system (Agilent Technologies), and incubated in the dark (1 h, 23
°C, 4 rpm) essentially as previously described.53 Following incubation, the microarrays were washed twice
in TBS-T and once in TBS for 3 min per wash. Finally, the microarrays
were dried by centrifugation and imaged in an Agilent G2505B (Agilent
Technologies) microarray scanner using the green channel (532 nm excitation,
90% photomultiplier tube, 5 μm resolution). Images were stored
as high-resolution.tif files.

Microarray data extraction from
image files was performed essentially
as previously described53 using GenePix
Pro v6.1.0.4 (Molecular Devices, Berkshire, U.K.). The data were then
exported as text to Excel (version 2010, Microsoft). Local background-corrected
median feature intensity data (F532median-B532) values were selected
and the median of six replicate spots per subarray was handled as
a single data point for graphical analysis. Binding-intensity data
are represented in bar charts as the mean intensity with single standard
deviation of all like experimental replicates.

Lectin Cytochemistry
Lectin cytochemistry was performed
at room temperature on primary astrocytes and Neu7 astrocytes. The
cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min and washed
four times in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) supplemented with 1 mM each
of the divalent cations Ca2+ and Mg2+ necessary
for lectin function for 2 min per wash. pBSA was used for all histochemical
blocking.54 The cells were blocked with
2% pBSA in TBS for 30 min, washed four times in TBS, and then incubated
with 20 μg/mL in TBS of the FITC-conjugated SNA-I, MAA, WFA,
or SBA lectins (Table 1) for 1 h in the dark. Inhibitory controls were also carried out
in parallel to ensure that lectin binding was carbohydrate-mediated.21 Inhibition was done by pre-incubating lectins
with 100 mM of appropriate haptenic carbohydrates in TBS for 1 h prior
to cell staining (SNA-I and MAA in lactose and WFA and SBA in GalNAc),
and lectin incubation was also carried out in the presence of the
appropriate haptenic sugar. After lectin incubation, the cells were
washed twice in TBS and incubated with DAPI for 5 min (1 μg/mL
in TBS). The cells were washed four times in TBS and mounted on glass
slides with a drop of ProLong Gold antifade reagent (Life Technologies,
Grand Island, NY). Images were captured on a Nikon Eclipse E400 fluorescent
microscope at 40× magnification and stored digitally for further
image analysis.

Lectin Histochemistry of Tissues
Lectin histochemistry
was carried out on three slides from all animals within the three
experimental groups. The frozen sections were rehydrated in TBS containing
0.05% Triton X-100 (TBS-T2) and washed twice in TBS-T for 2 min per
wash. The sections were blocked with 2% pBSA in TBS-T2 for 1 h at
room temperature and then washed twice. From this point all, all staining
procedures were carried out in the dark at room temperature. The sections
were then incubated with 20 μg/mL of FITC-conjugated SNA-I,
MAA, WFA, or SBA in TBS-T2 for 2 h. The sections were washed three
times in TBS-T2 for 2 min each, followed by a final wash in TBS, and
the slides were then cover slipped with ProLong Gold antifade reagent.
Inhibitory controls were carried out in parallel as described above.
Images were captured on a Nikon Eclipse E400 fluorescent microscope
at 40× magnification and stored digitally for subsequent image
analysis.

Dual Lectin and Immunohistochemistry of Tissues
For
lectin and immunohistochemistry double staining, immediately after
the final TBS wash step in the lectin histochemistry method (as above)
and continuing the staining procedures in the dark at room temperature,
the spinal cord sections were rehydrated in 0.01 M PBS and then blocked
with 20% normal goat serum (NGS) (Sigma-Aldrich Co., Dublin, Ireland)
in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 20 min. The primary antibodies
rabbit polyclonal anti-GFAP, 1:300 dilution (DakoCytomation, Dublin,
Ireland), rabbit polyclonal antineurogranin (1:100), mouse monoclonal
anti-βI-integrin (1:100), and rabbit polyclonal antigrowth-associated
protein-43 (GAP-43, 1:100) were diluted in PBS containing 2% NGS and
0.02% Triton X-100 and sections were incubated with the primary antibody
for 2 h. The sections were washed three times in PBS and the appropriate
secondary antibody, antirabbit IgG conjugated to rhodamine, or antimouse
conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY)
was diluted 1:500 in PBS and incubated for 1 h. The sections were
again washed in PBS and cover slipped with ProLong Gold antifade reagent.
A negative control was carried out for each antibody by substituting
PBS for the primary antibody. Images were captured on an Olympus IX81
fluorescent microscope at 20× and 40× magnifications and
stored digitally for further image analysis.

Image Analysis
Three images were captured at the same
exposure time from each coverslip containing primary astrocytes and
Neu7 astrocytes for each lectin stain. The images were then analyzed
for the integrated density of green fluorescence (lectin binding)
using Image Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Springs,
MD). The quantity of green fluorescence was compared to the number
of cells present using the DAPI images to count cell numbers and give
the integrated density reading per cell.

Three images were captured
from both the white matter and gray matter of the uninjured animal
group and from the white matter, gray matter, and lesion site of the
injured animal groups for all three lectins. Images were captured
at the same exposure time for each region of interest and animal group
examined. For each region of interest, the images were randomly chosen.
Image Pro Plus was again used to acquire the integrated density of
lectin binding from the digital images. For some of the images, the
brightness and contrast have been enhanced using Adobe Photoshop CS2
9.0 to allow for easier identification of positively stained tissue.

Statistical Analysis
The average integrated density
of lectin staining in vitro and in vivo for each sampling region was
calculated using Microsoft Excel v. 2007 and standard error of the
mean (SEM) was calculated. Statistical calculations were performed
using Minitab 16 software (Minitab Ltd., Coventry, U.K.). A two-way
analysis of variance was performed to examine differences between
regions of interest and treatment groups. Post-hoc comparisons were
undertaken by Fisher’s test. Differences were considered to
be statistically significant at a probability value (P) ≤ 0.05.
