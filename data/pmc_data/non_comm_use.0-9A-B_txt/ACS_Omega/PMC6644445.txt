The development of high volumetric
or areal capacitance energy
storage devices is critical for the future electronic devices. Hence,
the hunting for next-generation electrode materials and their design
is of current interest. The recent work in the two-dimensional metal
hydroxide nanomaterials demonstrates its ability as a promising candidate
for supercapacitor due to its unique structure and additional redox
sites. This study reports a design of freestanding high-mass-loaded
copper-cobalt hydroxide interconnected nanosheets for high-volumetric/areal-performance
electrode. The unique combination of hydroxide electrode with high
mass loading (26 mg/cm2) exhibits high areal and volumetric
capacitance of 20.86 F/cm2 (1032 F/cm3) at a
current density of 10 mA/cm2. This attributes to the direct
growth of hydroxides on porous foam and conductivity of copper, which
benefits the electron transport. The asymmetric supercapacitor device
exhibits a high energy density of 21.9 mWh/cm3, with superior
capacitance retention of 96.55% over 3500 cycles.

Introduction
The proliferating demand
for green and clean energy has excited
tremendous research efforts in the design and fabrication of the energy
storage devices, in particular, supercapacitor. Recent research has
focused on improving the specific capacitance of supercapacitor, but
a typical challenge for such a system is to increase the volumetric
capacitance.1−3 The only way to increase the volumetric capacitance
is higher mass loading with three-dimensional (3D) porous network.
Nevertheless, the crucial disadvantage of higher mass loading per
cubic centimeter is increasing the dead mass of an electrode.4 The highest volumetric capacitance achieved for
hydrated ruthenium oxide5 is around 1000–1500
F/cm3, activated graphene6,7 can reach the
capacitance of 200–350 F/cm3, activated carbon8,9 can reach 60–100 F/cm3, and Mxene10,11 can reach 1000 F/cm3 but only with low mass loading or
in thin film.

The two-dimensional solids are gaining tremendous
attention, in
particular, layered double hydroxide (LDH) with a general formula
of [M12+–x M3+x(OH)2]12−22 (M2+and M3+, the bivalent and trivalent metal
cations, respectively), due to the double benefit of their large active
surface area23−25 and high density of redox active species. Metal hydroxides
had been studied and proved to be a promising candidate for supercapacitors
exhibiting gravimetric capacitance exceeds that of reported metal
oxide materials. However, volumetric capacitance is limited due to
lower mass loading of active material. With increasing mass loading
per centimeter cubic, metal oxide/hydroxides show decrease in cyclability
as well as capacitance owing to lower surface active sites and etching
of active material. To date, all oxide/hydroxides have been studied
in thin film with lower mass loading.26−30

Layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets as
electrode for supercapacitor
application have raised particular interest.30,31 Several LDHs have been studied, including Ni–Co LDHs, Ni–Mn
LDHs, Ni–Fe LDHs, and Cu–Co LDHs.31−38 Although there are some publications on preparations39−43 and applications of Cu–Co LDHs, to our knowledge, the higher
mass loading of Cu–Co LDHs for high areal/volumetric supercapacitor
application has not been reported so far. The higher stability, good
conductivity, excellent electrochemical activity, and multiple functionality
over other metal hydroxides have let the Cu–Co LDHs to be an
ideal electrode for supercapacitor application. The copper-cobalt
double hydroxides reported in this study were prepared by growing
copper-cobalt double hydroxide higher mass loading on the nickel foam
with porous and layered nanostructures for supercapacitors. Here,
we report a two-dimensional copper-cobalt double hydroxide with different
mass loadings per centimeter square, demonstrating the improved electrochemical
properties when used as electrode material in a supercapacitor. The
unique combination of double hydroxide electrode with a high mass
loading of 26 mg/cm2 exhibits a high volumetric capacitance
of 1032 F/cm3 at a current density of 10 mA, which will
open up new opportunities to develop a high volumetric supercapacitor
and a new field in double hydroxide materials.

Results and Discussion
A schematic representation of the deposition process of high-density
layered copper-cobalt hydroxide (L-CCH) architecture is shown in Figure 1. The electrodeposited
L-CCH electrode results in the formation of a porous 3D-interconnected
two-dimensional layered framework with a large oxygen-containing functional
group, which was beneficial for increasing the electrochemical sites
within the network. The mass loading of the L-CCH can easily be tuned
with a variation of concentration of solute in the electrodeposition
process. The change in concentration of solute has been preferred
over time to have higher density of L-CCH electrode instead of growth
in the layered structure (Figure 1a). The growth mechanism and morphology of L-CCH network
is well understood from the field emission scanning electron microscopy
(FESEM) images that reveal the growth of 2D layered like interconnected
structure (Figure 1b). The insightful observation indicates the dense network of L-CCH
nanosheets that are approximately 100 nm in width and few microns
in length (Figure 1c). This interconnected structure can play an important role in increasing
the surface area and electrochemical sites for absorption. Further
energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis was carried out, which
confirms the presence of cobalt, copper, and oxygen, as shown in Figure 1f. The detailed spectroscopic
analysis of L-CCH structure was explored by Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy (FTIR) (Figure 1d). The peaks at 3134 and 3438 cm–1 are
assigned to O–H stretching vibration of water molecules in
the interlayer and hydrogen-bonded hydroxyl group of copper-cobalt
hydroxide. The other absorption bands observed below 700 cm–1 are associated with metal oxygen stretching and bending modes. The
spectrum shows a distinct peak at 524 and 541 cm–1, indicating the absorptions associated with Cu–O stretching
and Cu–OH bending vibrations, whereas that at 511 cm–1 corresponds to the Co–O stretching vibration.44Figure 1e shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the L-CCH electrode,
which shows the 2θ values at 13°, 26°, 33°, and
36°, corresponding to (001), (002), (120), and (121) lattice
plane, corresponding to copper hydroxide (JCPDS 42-0746), and the
peaks observed at 43°, 51°, 59°, and 74° 2θ
values, corresponding to (200), (102), (003), and (311) lattice plane,
which are in good agreement with the XRD data of cobalt hydroxide
of JCPDS 300443. The average grain size was estimated by using the
Debye–Scherer formula: D = 0.9 λ/β cos(θ),
where λ is 1.54A° for the wavelength of Cu Kα radiation,
“β” is full width at half-maximum, and “θ”
is the Bragg angle. The average grain size was found to be in the
range of 100 nm, which is in agreement with the SEM results.

Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have been extensively studied
as pseudocapacitive material and acknowledged as superior to metal
oxides due to higher electrochemical activity. However, the performance
of hydroxides/oxides completely depends on the electrode film thickness,
which limits their use in requisite high volumetric or areal capacitance
devices. Moreover, thick-film electrode without insulating binder
deteriorates the performance of metal oxide/hydroxide due to collapse
of 3D architecture as well as limited ionic transport in the inner
volume of the thicker electrode. To enhance the volumetric capacitance
of L-CCH electrode, a higher mass loading of 26 mg/cm2 electrode
was examined. In the initial experiments, we found that the volumetric
capacitance of lower mass loading L-CCH1 is negligible
compared to volumetric capacitance of high mass loading of L-CCH3.

First, the electrochemical properties of different
areal density
L-CCH electrodes were tested in 2 M KOH electrolyte. The electrically
conductive layer allows the thicker film with the high mass loading
formation without any binder. The obtained cyclic voltammetry (CV)
curves in 2 M KOH from 0.0 to 0.45 V potential versus Ag/AgCl are
shown in Figure 2a.
It is clearly seen from the typical CV curves of L-CCH electrode that
the capacitance increases by a factor of 10 in the higher-areal-density
electrode. Galvanostatic charge/discharge measurement (Figure 2b) was carried out for the
L-CCH1, L-CCH2, and L-CCH3 electrode
at a current density of 20 mA/cm2, which shows the discharge
time of 12.63, 32.72, and 192 s, respectively, suggesting the formation
of more redox sites in higher mass loading, which is in agreement
with CV results. Figure 2c shows the CVs of L-CCH3 electrode at a scan rate ranging
from 5 to 100 mV/s showing the semirectangular shape retained even
at a very high scan rate of 100 mV/s. The semirectangular shape may
be explained by the existence of double-layer capacitance as well
as pseudocapacitive behavior. The possible electrochemical faradic
process of L-CCH electrodes in 2 M KOH as electrolyte is 1   2  To study the areal and volumetric capacitance
of the L-CCH3, electrode galvanostatic charge/discharge
measurements were performed at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80, 102, 122,
204, and 306 mA/cm2 in 2 M KOH, shown in Figure 2d. A plot of current density
verses areal/volumetric capacitance for the high mass loading (L-CCH3) electrode is shown in Figure 2e. The excellent volumetric capacitance of 1032 F/cm3 and areal capacitance of 20.86 F/cm2 were measured
at a current density of 10 mA/cm2. The capacitance of L-CCH3 electrode was found to be 18.04 F/cm2, which is
18 times higher than that of L-CCH1 electrode (1.06 F/cm2) at the current density of 20 mA/cm2 and retains
50% of capacitance even at a high current density of 100 mA/cm2 (shown in Supporting Information Tables S1 and S2). This high capacitance value at a high scan rate
is assumed due to the more porous nature of L-CCH3 electrode,
which increases the rate of intercalation/deintercalation of an electrolyte
ion in the L-CCH 2D-interconnected layered framework. In addition,
it also reveals that the volumetric/areal capacitance is dependent
on the mass loading of L-CCH electrode. The cyclic stability of the
electrode was examined for >2000 charge/discharge cycles at a very
high current density of 60 mA/cm2 (Figure 2f). Usually, at higher current density, the
electrode stability decreases rapidly. However, in this study, the
capacity retention of 80% was found after 2000 cycles at 60 mA/cm2.

power density at various charge/discharge rates.

To elucidate the charge/discharge kinetics and semirectangular
behavior of L-CCH electrode for lower and higher mass loading, the
method given by Trasatti45,46 et al. was employed.
According to this method, the total charge storage of an electrode
is a sum of contribution due to an inner surface, where faradic reaction
occurs from the slow H+ ion donating species, and the outer
surface, where redox reaction can occur from fast charge transfer.
The capacitive charge (including both pseudocapacitance and electric
double-layer capacitance) depends on the potential scan rate given
by Trasatti in a way as follows 3   4  where Q* is the total charge
obtained by integrating the CV curve at different scan rates.

The capacitive charge contribution and the total charge contribution
can be calculated from the graphs, as shown in Figure 3a,b. In this process, the total charge storage
can be calculated from the y-axis intercept of Q* verses V1/2 and the charge
stored on the outer surface of the electrode can be calculated from
the plot of Q* against V−1/2. Moreover, the difference between the total charge and the charge
stored on the outer surface will give the value of the charge stored
in the inner surface. As shown in Figure 3a, the value of the maximum total charge
stored is found to be 8.3486 C/cm2, which is equivalent
to the maximum areal capacitance ∼20.86 F/cm2 for
the potential window 0.45 V. Furthermore, the charge stored at the
outer surface, (Figure 3b) was found to be 1.606 C/cm2 (∼3.56 F/cm2) and the charge stored in the inner surface (diffusion-controlled
redox capacity) was found to be 6.7426 C/cm2 (∼14.98
F/cm2). From Figure 3c, it is clear that the diffusion-controlled redox capacity
increases on increasing the mass loading. The L-CCH3 electrode
exhibited 80.77% diffusion-controlled redox capacity, whereas L-CCH2 and L-CCH1 exhibited 45.94 and 43.66%, respectively.
Increase in the total charge might be the reason for the corresponding
higher areal and volumetric capacitance for L-CCH3 electrode
compared to that of L-CCH2 and L-CCH1. It is
speculated that the surface Grotthuss mechanism18 is responsible for the diffusion of H+ ions
to the inner region surface.

the electrode material. (b) Plot of Q* against V–1/2 to find the charge stored only on
the outer surface of the electrode material (Q*outer).
(c) Contributions of double-layer capacity and diffusion-controlled
redox capacity to the total capacity of the electrode. (d) Plot of
log I and log V to
find the value of b (b = 0.53, 0.75,
and 0.71 for L-CCH1, L-CCH2, and L-CCH3)

The total electrochemical charge
storage can be obtained by integrating
the CV curve, and this charge originates from two contributions: the
faradic contribution limited by ion diffusion together with fast charge-transfer
process at the surface and the non-faradic contribution from the fast
electric double-layer effect. This effect can be analyzed by the CV
curve at the different scan rates using the power law47−49i = aVb, where “a” and “b” are adjustable
parameters. b value can be determined by the slope
of log i against log V. Ideally, if b value is ∼0.5, then the capacity
response is diffusion controlled and it satisfies Cottrell’s
equation9i = V1/2 and b = 1 shows purely
capacitive response (including both double-layer capacitance and diffusion-controlled
redox capacitance). From Figure 3d, the b value of L-CCH3 is found to be 0.53, which demonstrates the dominancy of diffusion-controlled
redox capacitance, which agrees with our results. For L-CCH1 and L-CCH2, b values were 0.75 and 0.71,
respectively, which shows the capacitive response. This confirms the
higher mass of our L-CCH3 electrode increases the diffusion-controlled
redox activity and is dominant in this study.

The electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is an important
characterization tool to evaluate the resistive behavior of the electrode. Figure 4a shows the respective
Nyquist plots for three different electrodes from f = 0.01 to 10 000 Hz, where Z′ is
the real part and Z″ is the imaginary part
of the impedance, respectively. The Nyquist plots consist of three
characteristic regions:50,51 (1) a low-frequency
region that is represented by an inclined line along the imaginary
axis which shows capacitive behavior also known as double-layer capacitive
region; (2) a high-frequency region represented by a partial semicircle
which shows the blocking behavior of the supercapacitor (in this region,
the supercapacitor behaves as a pure resistor and the resistance values
determines the charge-transfer and series resistance of the electrode);
and (3) a middle-frequency range that shows the effect of electrode
thickness and the porosity on the diffusion of ions from electrolyte
to electrode. The inset of the Figure 4g shows the equivalent circuit [R(C{RQ})W] used for the
fitting curve of L-CCH3. Rs is the equivalent series resistance of an electrolyte, Rct is the charge-transfer resistance during the faradic
reaction, Cd is the electric double-layer
resistance, Zw is the Warburg impedance
that represents the impedance of the diffusion controlling process
in the electrolyte, and CPE is the constant-phase element. Electrochemical
impedance is defined as51,52ZCPE = [Y0(jω)n]−1, where the unit of Y0 is 1 S/cm2 and is independent of
frequency and n is the exponent whose values varies
between −1 and +1; when n = −1, the
CPE is pure inductor; when n = 0, the CPE behaves
as a pure resistor; and when n = 1, CPE is pure capacitor.
In our experiment, the CPE value for L-CCH3 is found to
be n = 1.0, which shows that CPE behaves like a pure
capacitor, which is in good agreement with our results. Nyquist plots
clearly show that in the high-frequency region, L-CCH3 has
a lower series resistance value (Rs =
0.59 Ω) than that of L-CCH1 and L-CCH2 (Supporting Information Figure S1), which
implies that the resistance of an electrolyte solution is lesser in
L-CCH3 electrode. Moreover, the impedance spectrum of L-CCH3 shows a smaller semicircle (Rct = 0.11 Ω) than that that of the L-CCH1 and L-CCH2, which suggests that the L-CCH3 has a good electrical
conductivity between the prepared electrode and current collecting
electrode, as well as lower charge-transfer resistance, which is attributed
to the significant increase in the capacitance value of L-CCH3. Additionally, in the low-frequency region, the ideal straight
line implies a higher rate of electrolyte diffusion
and mass transfer. Figure 4c shows the good access to the electrolyte and ionic diffusion
even after 2000 cycles attributed to the excellent electrical conductivity
and very low internal resistance (Figure 4b). The Bode plots show phase angle values
obtained for higher mass loading electrode is close to 74, which is
almost near to that of the ideal capacitor, suggesting that the prepared
material is suitable for the fabrication of low-leakage capacitor.
Moreover, no significant change occurs in the phase angle after 2000
cycles. The EIS data strongly supports the excellent electrochemical
activity and high rate capability.

and after cycles for L-CCH3

The relaxation time constant τ is a measure of how
fast the
device can discharge and obtained from the analysis of the complex
plots. The complex capacitance is expressed as C(ω)
= C′(ω) + jC″(ω),
where C′(ω) is the real part of the
capacitance that shows the amount of stored energy in farad and C″(ω) is the imaginary part of the capacitance
that shows the energy dissipation as a function of the angular frequency
and they are given by22 5   6  where Z′ and Z″ are
the real and imaginary part of the impedance,
ω = 2πf, and Z(ω)
= Z′(ω) + jZ″(ω),
where ω is the angular frequency.

The complex power is
defined as S(ω) = P(ω)
+ jQ(ω), where P(ω)
is the real part of complex power called active
power and Q(ω) is the imaginary part of the
complex power called reactive power, and they are given by 7   8  where ΔVrms = ΔVmax/√2 and
ΔVmax is the maximum value of the
potential (here,
0.45 V). From Figure 4e, the relaxation time constant (τ = 1/f)
can be calculated from either the frequency corresponding to the half
of the maximum value of the real part of capacitance, that is, from C′(ω) against the frequency plot or peak frequency
corresponding to the C″(ω) against frequency
plots. As shown in Figure 4c, the real part of the capacitance decreases as the frequency
increases, which is a characteristic of the electrode material and
the electrode/electrolyte interface. The more detailed characteristics
of relaxation time constant can be obtained from the normalized power
against frequency plot. Figure 4f shows the plot of the real part of power P/S and imaginary part Q/S against frequency plots. The power dissipated into the
systems can be analyzed from the active power P/S. The impedance behavior of the supercapacitor varies from
the ideal capacitive behavior at a low frequency where no power is
dissipated to the pure resistive behavior at a high frequency where P = 100%. In fact, P/S and Q/S show the opposite trend
with respect to the frequency. The crossing of the two plots P/S and Q/S appears at ϕ = 45° and will give the value of the frequency
corresponding to the relaxation time. It defines the capacitive behavior
at frequencies below 1/τ and resistive behavior at frequencies
above 1/τ. From the crossing point of the two plots, the relaxation
time has been calculated for higher and lower mass loading. The obtained
relaxation times for L-CH1, L-CCH2, and L-CCH3 were 1, 2, and 12 s, respectively.

To study the practical application
of high mass loading L-CCH3 architecture, an asymmetric
supercapacitor is fabricated
by using L-CCH3 as a positive electrode and the activated
carbon cloth (ACC) as a negative electrode. Figure 5a shows the CV curves of carbon cloth within
a 0.0 to 1.0 V and L-CCH3 electrode within a 0.0 to 0.45
V voltage window. The prepared L-CCH3//ACC asymmetric device
operates at a higher voltage window from 0.0 to 1.2 V at different
scan rates ranging from 10 to 200 mV/s, exhibiting the combined behavior
of carbon cloth and L-CCH electrode (Figure 5b). The CV curves show obvious reduction
oxidation peak within a 0 to 1.2 V potential window. Interestingly,
with the increasing scan rate, no major shifts are observed in the
oxidation reduction peak, which shows the device ability to sustain
a high charge/discharge rate and an excellent ability of ion diffusion
into the electrode surface. Figure 5c shows the galvanostatic charge/discharge curve of
L-CCH3//ACC at various current densities from 3 to 10.5
mA/cm2. The areal capacitance values calculated from charge-discharge
(CD) curves are 2.43, 2.32, 2.24, 2.18, 2.14, 2.04, and 1.98 F/cm2 and 109.73, 104.38, 100.81, 98.14, 96.35, 92.11, and 89.22
F/cm3 at the current densities of 3, 4.5, 6, 7.5, 9, 10.5,
and 12 mA, respectively (shown in Supporting Information Table S4). The comparative study of different
areal capacitance values and their energy densities is shown in Supporting
Information Table S5, which shows the highest
performance of L-CCH electrode in terms of area/volumetric capacitance
as well as energy density.

The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
of an asymmetric device
is also studied to gain the understanding of electrochemical behavior. Figure 5d represents plot
of areal and volumetric capacitance as a function of current densities
and Figure 5e shows
the cyclic performance during 3500 charge/discharge cycles. Figure 5f shows the Nyquist
plot and the corresponding equivalent circuit. The asymmetric device
shows a very low series resistance Rs =
0.9 Ω and a charge-transfer resistance of 2.11 Ω. The
relatively low values of Rs and Rct represent the higher accessibility in the
diffusion of ions in the electrolyte to the electrode material during
charge/discharge cycles, which is responsible for an excellent electrochemical
performance of an asymmetric device. To study the stability of an
asymmetric device, the cycle stability tests were carried out at 8.33
mA/cm2 current density, shown in Figure 5e. The asymmetric device exhibits an excellent
cyclic stability with capacitive retention of 96.55% after 3500 cycles. Figure 5i shows the Ragone
plot of several commercially available energy storage devices. It
can be seen from the plot that the energy density of L-CCH3//ACC supercapacitor reached close to the energy density of Li thin-film
batteries and power density approached close to the power density
of the 25 mF supercapacitor. The imperative feature of this device
is a very small characteristic relaxation time constant τ0 (the minimum time required to discharge all energy from the
device), which is only 12 s. Thus, the areal/volumetric capacitance
values described above are probably near to the maximum values possible
for LDH materials in general. Thus, the fact is that high volumetric
and areal capacitance of L-CCH material may also enable LDHs use in
supercapacitors. Thus, this work opens up exciting possibilities of
developing higher mass loading of LDH electrode supercapacitor devices
using a large variety of combinations of metals and their chemistries.

Conclusions
In summary, a simple and reproducible method has been adopted to
demonstrate the electrochemical performance of copper-cobalt hydroxide
with higher mass loading in aqueous electrolyte. Benefits of the double
metal hydroxide and 2D structure contribute to the ultra-high volumetric/areal
pseudocapacitive performance. The 2D hydroxide structure reveals an
enhanced volumetric capacitance response of 1032 F/cm3.
The enhanced capacitance was due to the high mass loading layered
structure with porous structure leading to more electrochemical sites
for redox response, as well as high ionic diffusion and better electron
conductivity of copper in copper-cobalt hydroxide electrode. The prepared
asymmetric supercapacitor showed a high areal and volumetric capacitance
of 2.43 F/cm2 (109 F/cm3) at 2.41 mA/cm2 and exhibited an excellent cyclic stability with 96.55% capacitive
retention after 3500 cycles at the current density of 8.33 mA/cm2. Thus, this effective method of fabricating a freestanding
metal hydroxide/carbon asymmetric device paves the way for practical
application of an energy storage device.

Methods
Synthesis of
L-CCH/Ni-Foam Electrode
All chemicals
were of analytical grade and used without further purification. Before
depositing copper-cobalt LDHs, nickel foam was washed with 0.1 M HCl
solution for 3 min and cleaned with deionized water to remove NiO
layer from its surface. The cleaned nickel foam was dried in a vacuum
oven overnight at 60 °C and used as the working electrode (1.5
cm × 1 cm). Platinum and Ag/AgCl were used as the counter and
reference electrode, respectively. The Cu–Co LDHs were electrochemically
deposited by dissolving 4 mM Cu(NO3)2·3H2O and 8 mM of Co(NO3)2·6H2O in 30 mL of distilled water at a constant voltage of −1
V for 300 s. Further, the electrodeposited Cu–Co LHDs were
cleaned with distilled water and dried in vacuum oven overnight at
80 °C. The mass loading of the electrode was measured before
and after electrodeposition. The same procedure is repeated by taking
different concentrations of copper nitrate trihydrate and cobalt nitrate
hexahydrate to prepare a different mass loading electrode to compare
the results. The different mass loading electrode of 4.69, 8.77, and
26.53 mg/cm2 are denoted as L-CCH1, L-CCH2, and L-CCH3, respectively.

Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns
were recorded with a PAN-analytical diffractometer equipped with Cu
Kα (λ = 1.5405 Å) X-ray source in geometry and 0.5
s dwelling time with a proportional detector. An anti-scattering incident
slit (2 mm) and nickel filter were used. The tube voltage and current
were 40 kV and 40 mA, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
was performed on a JEOL JSM 7610F FESEM equipped with energy-dispersive
spectroscopy (EDS) Oxford instruments, X-Max with coating unit (make:
JEOL, model: JEC-3000FC). The EDS mapping was obtained at low magnification
at random points of the electrodeposited film. Fourier transform infrared
spectra were obtained from the Perkin Elmer Spectrum one instrument.
All electrochemical measurements were carried out using a Metrohm
Autolab 128N potentiostat (Netherland) with 2 M KOH aqueous electrolyte
in electrochemical cell. Ag/AgCl and platinum foil were used as pseudo
reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively, whereas electrodeposited
L-CCH was the working electrode.

Electrochemical Measurement
Electrochemical performance
of L-CCH electrodes was studied by using a three-electrode configuration
and 2 M KOH as an electrolyte. Platinum foil and silver/silver chloride
electrode are used as a counter and a reference electrode, respectively.
Cyclic voltammetry was performed on a Metrohm Autolab-128N potentiostat.
The electrodeposited L-CCH electrodes were used as a working electrode
in a three-electrode system. CV measurement was carried out at different
scan rates in the potential window 0 to 0.45 V. The charge/discharge
study was performed at different current densities of 10, 20, 30,
40, 50, 60, 80, 102, 122, 142, 204, and 306 mA/cm2 in a
potential window of 0 to 0.45 V.
