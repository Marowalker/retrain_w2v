The Bayan Obo rare earth (BORE) concentrate
is the largest
light rare earth mineral resource in the world. The decomposition
of the BORE concentrate is a principal step to develop new technologies
to recover useful elements and is therefore of much importance. In
this paper, the phase transformation and thermal decomposition kinetics
of the BORE concentrate in air were investigated. The results showed
that bastnaesite decomposed upon air roasting. The roasted solid was
recovered by sulfuric acid leaching. The activation energy and pre-exponential
factor of the roasting reaction of the BORE concentrate were calculated
through the isoconversional methods of Flynn–Wall–Ozawa
and Kissinger, and the probable mechanism function was estimated through
the Coats–Redfern method. The kinetic model that best describes
the thermal decomposition reaction for the BORE concentrate is the
A2 (Avrami–Erofeev 2) model, and the corresponding probable
mechanism function is f(α) = 2(1 – α)[−ln(1
– α)]1/2 and G(α) =
[−ln(1 – α)]1/2.

Introduction
Bayan Obo rare earth
(BORE) ore
deposit (Inner Mongolia, China) is the largest light RE resource in
the world. RE elements exist primarily as bastnaesite ((Ce, La)CO3(F, OH)) and monazite ((Ce, Th, La, Pr, Nd)PO4)
in the BORE ore.1 The mass of total Ce
accounts for about 50% of RE elements in the BORE concentrate. Ce
is separated first, which will simplify the following extracting process
of other RE(III) elements and make it to be more convenient.2 Apart from RE elements, fluorine (F) accounts
for 7–8% and phosphorus (P) for 4–6% in the BORE concentrate.
Nowadays, the predominant treatment for the BORE concentrate is using
the concentrated
sulfuric acid method industrially.3 However,
this method cannot recover F and P resources and causes different
types of pollution in the environment.4 In recent years, some new technologies for processing the BORE concentrate
have been proposed, for instance, the two-step oxidation method.5 First, bastnaesite in the BORE concentrate was
decomposed by oxidation roasting, and then, the roasted product was
leached by sulfuric acid. Then, the RE hydroxide was obtained by alkaline
attacking of the roasted and leached residue,
containing monazite as the main phase. Finally, the RE hydroxide cake
was oxidized by wet air oxidation and then leached with sulfuric acid.
After pretreatment with the two-step oxidation method, a mixed H2SO4 leaching liquor containing Ce(IV), F, and P
was obtained, which were recovered
by solvent extraction with Cyanex 923. The yield of rare earth elements
for the whole process can reach as high as 95%.

With the rapid
development in
mineral-processing technology, the BORE concentrate with a grade of
50% or even more than 60% REO (rare earth oxides) was obtained.6 The mole ratio of bastnaesite to monazite in
the 50% REO-grade BORE
concentrate was as high as 3:1 and was even 4:1 for the 60% REO-grade
RE concentrate. Regarding such a high content of bastnaesite in the
BORE concentrate, the idea of processing bastnaesite first in the
concentrate was feasible. According to the reported research works,
bastnaesite in the BORE concentrate can be decomposed by oxidation
roasting and solvent extraction methods.7−10

The kinetics of
oxidation roasting of bastnaesite in the rare earth (RE) concentrate
is very important to find out the factors affecting unit operation
and process control. Thus, it is necessary to investigate the decomposition
process and reaction kinetics of the RE concentrate.
Since 1951, the thermogravimetric (TG) analysis technique has been
applied to study the reaction kinetics. Afterward, several methods
for the processing of kinetics data, such as Flynn–Wall–Ozawa,
Kissinger, Freeman–Carroll, and so on, were proposed.11 The roasting reaction process and kinetics of
bastnaesite have been reported.12−16 The
activation energy of the roasting reaction of bastnaesite is obtained
to be 177–230 kJ mol–1; the reaction mechanism
involves nucleation and nuclei growth, and its reaction kinetics model
can be expressed as f(α) = 1 – α
and g(α) = −ln(1 – α).
However, the BORE concentrate is a mixed ore consisting of bastnaesite
and monazite. There were studies on the thermal decomposition kinetics
of the BORE concentrate mixed with sodium carbonate and on the decomposition
mechanism of the BORE concentrate with concentrated sulfuric acid.17,18 However, the thermal decomposition kinetics of bastnaesite in mixed
ores in a complicated system is rarely studied. The study on the thermal
decomposition of the BORE concentrate will be of great significance
for developing new technologies for processing BORE ores.

The
goal of this paper was to study the thermal behavior in the oxidation
roasting process of the BORE concentrate. The roasting mechanism of
the RE concentrate was determined by characterizing the phase and
structural transformation of RE elements. Then, the reaction kinetics
of RE concentrate decomposition was investigated by a non-isothermal
method and the activation energy, pre-exponential factor, and mechanism
function were determined.

Results and
Discussion
Recovery of REO from the Rare
Earth Concentrate
Effect of the Roasting
Temperature on the Leaching Ratio
The effect of the roasting
temperature on the leaching ratio of REO was investigated at temperatures
ranging from 350 to 600 °C. All concentrate samples were roasted
for 2 h. As shown in Figure 1, when the temperature was below 450 °C, the leaching
ratio of REO increased as the temperature increased. Above 500 °C,
the leaching ratio began to decrease. The result indicated that the
leaching ratio of REO increased as the roasted temperature increased
from 350 to 500 °C (from 8.21 to 70.51%). When the temperature
was above 500 °C, the RE concentrate was sintered and the surface
became compacted, thus reducing the leaching ratio of REO.19Figure 2 shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the products
of the RE concentrate roasted at different temperatures. As can be
seen from Figure 2,
the phase of bastnaesite (PDF no. #11-0340) still existed in the sample
when the roasting temperature was not higher than 400 °C. When
the temperature increased to 450 °C, bastnaesite began to disappear
and a new phase of the roasted product, Ce3O4F3 (PDF no. #21-0184)/(La, Pr, Nd)OF (PDF no. #22-0168),
appeared. The phases of the roasted products above 450 °C were
almost the same, that is, left unreacted monazite (PDF no. #46-1295)
and newly generated Ce3O4F3/(La,
Pr, Nd)OF. This indicated that bastnaesite in the RE concentrate was
completely decomposed when the temperature was above 500 °C.

Characterization of the Sulfuric Acid
Leached Product
To investigate the existing form of RE concentrate
in the roasted solid, the products roasted at 500 °C were leached
by sulfuric acid at 85 °C for 1 h (solid–liquid ratio
1:4, g mL–1, 3 mol L–1 H2SO4). The filtrate was collected and used to analyze the
composition. The XRD patterns of the roasted product and the leaching
residue are shown in Figure 3. The composition of the leaching residue is listed in Table 2. As shown in Figure 3, the peaks
of bastnaesite existed in the RE concentrate, whereas the peaks of
bastnaesite disappeared and the peaks of (La, Pr, Nd)OF and Ce3O4F3 appeared in the roasted product.
This result suggested that bastnaesite in the RE concentrate was decomposed
completely to (La, Pr, Nd)OF or Ce3O4F3. In the leaching residue, the main phases were monazite and CaSO4. It was explained that (La, Pr, Nd)OF/Ce3O4F3 was leached into the sulfuric acid solution.
The result of chemical composition analysis indicated that the mass
fraction of REO in the leaching residue was 48.03% (Table 1). The REO leaching ratio was
calculated to be 70.51% under the given experimental conditions. Therefore,
a majority of RE elements can be effectively separated from the RE
concentrate first through oxidation roasting and sulfuric acid leaching
step.

products (A) and the leaching
residue (B).

Reaction Kinetics Analysis
TG and Differential
Thermal Analysis DTA
Analyses
The kinetics of BORE concentrate thermal decomposition
was determined through the thermogravimetric method. TG and DTA curves
of the RE concentrate at heating rates of 4, 6, 8, and 10 K min–1 are shown in Figures 4 and 5, respectively. As the
heating rate increased, the TG curves moved to the higher temperature
range and the strength of endothermic peaks increased. Besides, there
was one mass loss in TG curves and one endothermic peak in the DTA curve.
Therefore, the thermal decomposition process has only one stage within
the given temperature range, as illustrated in Figure S1. The mass loss and endothermic peak occurred at
about 440–450 °C. This could be due to the release of
CO2 and the decomposition of bastnaesite
from REFCO3 to REOF. 1  The
total mass loss
was about 13%, which was in agreement with the theoretical value of
13.63% (the calculation method is shown in the Supporting Information) for the release of CO2 owing
to the decomposition of bastnaesite in the RE concentrate.

Kinetics Models
The degree of conversion
(α) is defined as 2  where m0 is the
initial mass of the sample (g), mt is
the mass at a certain temperature (g), and mf is the final mass (g).

According to the solid–solid
kinetics equation20 3  where α is the degree of
conversion, t is the reaction time (s), T is the reaction temperature (K), f(α) is
the reaction model, and k(T) is
the kinetics rate constant, which can be described as 4  where R is the gas constant
(8.314 J mol–1 K–1), A is the pre-exponential factor (s–1), and Ea is the apparent activation energy (kJ mol–1).

The heating rate can be calculated by the
reaction temperature divided by the reaction time, so 5  where β
is the heating rate (K min–1). For reaction kinetics
under non-isothermal conditions, 6   7  where G(α)
is the integral form of the reaction model.

Many methods were
adopted to determine the kinetics parameters.21 In our study, the kinetics of the BORE concentrate decomposition
was determined using both Flynn–Wall–Ozawa and Kissinger
models.

(a) Flynn–Wall–Ozawa method22 8  According
to eq 8, Ea can be calculated from the slope of lg β
versus  at different conversions.

(b) Kissinger
method23 9  where Tp is the temperature
at which the reaction rate is maximum in DTA curves. Ea and A can be obtained from the slope
and intercept of the line plot of  against .

In our study, the most
probable mechanism function of the RE concentrate was determined by
the Coats–Redfern equation (eq 10).24 10  As can be
seen from eq 10, if
the mechanism function is correct,  is linear to . If the linear relationship between  and  is good and the
obtained Ea by this method is closer to
the Ea obtained from the Kissinger or
Ozawa method, the mechanism function is the most probable mechanism
function. Table S1 presents the common
thermal decomposition reaction mechanism functions for the solid state.

Model Evaluation
In this paper,
four different heating rates (4, 6, 8, and 10 K min–1) were adopted to investigate the relationship between Ea and α through the isoconversional method.25,26 The plot of α at different heating rates versus temperature
is illustrated in Figure 6.

Figure 6 Conversion
at different heating rates.

The α values changing from 0.1 to 0.9 were adopted
for the kinetic process analysis. The values of ln β
at different α’s were calculated, as indicated in Figure 7. On the basis of eq 8, Ea was obtained from the slope of the plot of ln β
versus  according to the
Arrhenius formula at the selected conversion. Each heating rate corresponds
to each Arrhenius plot. Therefore, batteries of values were obtained
from the slopes of linear regressions of Figure 7. Table S2 presents
the data of ln β values and their linear regressions
with . The results indicated
that the correlation coefficients (R2)
were more than 0.99. That is to say, the Flynn–Wall–Ozawa
method fitted the kinetics data of the BORE concentrate decomposition
process in our study. Therefore, it also showed
that our speculation on the thermal decomposition kinetics model of
BORE was reasonable.

versus .

The plot of Ea versus α
is illustrated in Figure 8. As can be seen from Figure 8, Ea was within
the range of 160–190 kJ mol–1 when α
changed within the range of 0.1–0.9.

Figure 8 Plot of Ea versus α.

Figure 9 shows
the relationship of  with  of different
β’s.
Based on eq 9, Ea and A can be obtained from
the plot of  against . The correlations
shown in Figure 9 suggest
that the data calculated from the experiment fitted very well eq 8 and thus with the obtained
kinetic parameters of the RE concentrate decomposition.
The calculated Ea and A were 152.81 kJ mol–1 and 3.07 × 1010 s–1, respectively.

Figure 9 Plot of  versus .

By processing the data
of TG and DTA curves and fitting different mechanism functions listed
in Table S1, it was found that the data
best fitted with the Avrami–Erofeev 2 mechanism function (Figure 10). The data calculated
from Figure 10 is
listed in Table 2. The results showed that the obtained average Ea (191.30 kJ mol–1) was close
to that obtained by the Flynn–Wall–Ozawa method (160–190
kJ mol–1) and the Kissinger method (152.81 kJ mol–1). Therefore, this indicated that the A2 mechanism
function is the probable mechanism function of the RE concentrate
decomposition. That is,

Conclusions
In
this paper, the thermal decomposition of the BORE concentrate
by oxidation roasting was studied. Also, the reaction kinetics and
mechanism were obtained. Bastnaesite in the RE concentrate was completely
decomposed by oxidation roasting at 500 °C, and the main phase
of the roasted solid was REOF, which could be leached out by sulfuric
acid with 70.51% REO leaching ratio. The activation energy of the
roasting reaction of the BORE concentrate was calculated through the
isoconversional methods of Flynn–Wall–Ozawa (160–190
kJ mol–1) and Kissinger (152.81 kJ mol–1), and the probable mechanism function was estimated through the
Coats–Redfern method. The kinetic model that best describes
the thermal decomposition reaction for the BORE concentrate is the
A2 (Avrami–Erofeev) model, and the corresponding probable mechanism
function is f(α) = 2(1 – α)[−ln(1
– α)]1/2 and G(α) =
[−ln(1 – α)]1/2.

Experimental Section

Co. Ltd. of China Northern Rare Earth. The concentrate of an average
practical size of <74 μm was prepared by sieving. The structure
and composition of the concentrate are presented in Figure 11 and Table 3, respectively. The main phases were bastnaesite

Methods
Thermal Decomposition
Experiment
The
thermal decomposition experiment was conducted in a muffle furnace
at temperatures within the range of 350–600 °C in an air
atmosphere (>99.9%). Once the desired value of the temperature
was reached, the concentrate samples were put into the muffle furnace.
After being roasted for 2 h, the samples were taken out to cool in
a dryer. Then, X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 FOCUS, Germany) was
adopted to analyze the phase composition.

Sulfuric Acid Leaching
To find out the contents of
REO, the roasted products were leached by 2.5 mol L–1 sulfuric acid at 85 °C for 1 h in a DF-101 thermostat magnetic
stirrer reactor. The ratio of solid to liquid was 1:4, and the stirring
speed was 350 rpm. Then, the leach liquor was filtrated. Also, the
content of REO in the filtrate was analyzed by the inductively coupled
plasma (ICP) method. Thus, the leaching ratio of REO (η) can
be calculated as follows 11  where CREO is the concentration
of REO in the filtrate (g L–1), VF is the volume (L), mc is the mass of the rare earth concentrate, and ω
is the mass fraction of REO in the rare earth concentrate.

After
filtration, the leaching residue was dried at 105 °C for 24 h.
The chemical and phase structures of the residue were analyzed by
ICP-atomic emission spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction techniques.

Thermal Decomposition Kinetics
The thermal decomposition
kinetics of the BORE concentrate was determined
by thermogravimetric analysis with a non-isothermal method. A thermogravimetric
analyzer (STA-449 F3, NETZSCH, Germany) was adopted to measure the
thermal decomposition process to obtain TG and DTA curves, where the
mass loss of the concentrate sample was measured. In each test, about
10 mg of the concentrate sample (<74 μm) was heated in a
corundum crucible from 25 to 800 °C at the heating rates of 4,
6, 8, and 10 K min–1 in air with a flow rate of
20 mL min–1. Experimental curves of TG and DTA of
the RE concentrate thermal decomposition are illustrated in Figure S1.
