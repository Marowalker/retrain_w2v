The development of hybrid nanostructures of graphene
oxide (GO)
and metal nanoparticles (NPs) is of paramount interest for highly
flexible surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrate-based
molecular sensing. In this work, we report a simple and eco-friendly
synthesis strategy for the synthesis of a three-dimensional (3D) GO/gold
nanostar (3D GO/Au NS) hybrid nanocomposite using deep eutectic solvent
(DES) for SERS-based molecular sensing. The 3D GO/Au NS hybrid nanocomposite
was obtained by a two-step synthetic process. In the first step, the
GO nanosheets of thickness ∼1.25 nm were homogeneously dispersed
in choline chloride/urea (molar ratio of 1:2)-derived DES, followed
by functionalization of −NH groups using 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane.
Afterward, the presynthesized Au NSs of size ranging between 150–200 nm were then covalently attached
on the −NH-functionalized GO nanosheets mediated by DES at
60 °C to obtain 3D GO/Au NS hybrid nanocomposites. Importantly,
the SERS substrate fabricated using the 3D GO/Au NS hybrid nanocomposite
exhibits highly enhanced SERS activity with an enhancement factor
of 1.7 × 105 and high sensitivity for the detection
of crystal violet with a concentration up to 10–11 M. The green synthetic approach presented here can be expected to
be promising for the large-scale fabrication of GO–metal NP-based
hybrid nanostructures for their potential applications in SERS-based
sensing.

1 Introduction
Surface-enhanced Raman
scattering (SERS) spectroscopy has been
validated as a highly powerful, specific, nondestructive spectroscopy
technique for the detection of chemical and biological analyte molecules
at a concentration down to a single-molecule level.1−4 After the discovery of Raman enhancement
onto rough silver electrodes in 1974,5 it
has become a rapidly growing field of research, which stimulated various
emerging applications such as biosensors,6 bioimaging,7 biomarkers,8 bioanalyses,2 photothermal therapy,9 and monitoring catalytic reactions.10 The signal enhancement in SERS is largely governed
by the intensified electromagnetic mechanism (EM).3,11 When
the light is incident onto the plasmonic nanostructures, free electrons
on the surface of the nanoparticles (NPs) are concentrated to the
corner sites or edges, leading to the enhancement of the local electromagnetic
field, which serves as “SERS hotspots”.12 If an analyte molecule is placed in the vicinity of these
“hotspots”, the intensity of the Raman signal by molecules
is enhanced considerably.11 The noble metal
nanostructures, particularly those made of silver (Ag),13 gold (Au),14,15 and bimetallic
Au@Ag NPs,16 have been extensively studied
for SERS applications because of their widely tunable localized surface
plasmon resonance (LSPR) and intense local EM field around the NPs,
which are capable of contributing SERS signals in the order of 104–108 when a target analyte molecule is on
the metal NP surface.11 In particular,
anisotropic gold nanostars (Au NSs) have received particular research
interest because of their strong and easy tunable LSPR from the visible
to near-infrared region and generation of intense localized EM field
originating from their sharp tips/edges of the Au NSs, which serves
as SERS “hotspots” for amplified SERS signal enhancement.17−19

Recently, tremendous research efforts have been focused on
the
development of flexible and reproducible SERS substrates by combining
plasmonic metallic NPs over different support matrices for practical
applications.20−23 Among various substrate materials explored, two-dimensional (2D)
layered GR or graphene oxide (GO) has attracted a significant attention
for application in SERS because of its distinct properties and it
is well known to interact easily with various organic analyte molecules
via π–π stacking, which facilitates efficient charge
transfer from the analyte molecules.24−26 Such excellent properties
of GR or GO are of great research interest as an ideal substrate material
for various applications in SERS,27 in
which the SERS signal arises by the chemical enhancement mechanism
(CMEM). To observe CMEM, the target molecules should be close to the
substrates for chemical interaction to be effective.28,29 However, the CMEM has a short-range effect, which can contribute
to the signal enhancement in the order of 10–100.24 Hence, combination of Au NSs with GR/GO is expected
to be a promising approach for the SERS substrates because of the
synergetic effect of both EM and CMEM.30,31 Furthermore,
previous studies have demonstrated that the SERS enhancement factors
(EFs) and stability of the SERS substrates can be further amplified
by forming a 3D GO/NP hybrid nanocomposite in order to diffuse the
analyte molecules inside the porous structures.32−34

Over
the past few years, numerous synthetic approaches have been
explored for the controlled synthesis of metal NPs supported over
GR/GO nanosheets to obtain GO/NP hybrid nanocomposites.35−38 The ionic liquids have shown to be promising as an efficient medium
for the controlled synthesis and functionalization of a variety of
nanostructures because of their unique physicochemical properties.39 Recently, deep eutectic solvents (DESs) emerged
as a new and advanced type of IL analogues, which are considered to
be a potential alternative to standard ILs, have attracted great attention
in the past few years for the synthesis of different nanostructured
materials because of their excellent properties and potential technological
applications.40 DESs are a class of liquids
formed by the mixing proper ratios of two compounds having high melting
points (i.e., hydrogen bond acceptor and hydrogen bond donor), which
lead to the formation of eutectic mixtures with low melting points
that are close to room temperature.41 The
main advantages of DES are as follows: it is derived from natural
origin, has low toxicity, high biocompatibility, biodegradability,
and low cost, and plays a dual role as a solvent and template for
the nanostructure synthesis.42,43 Such fascinating properties
of DES provide a promising platform for designing functional nanostructured
materials that include controlled surface functionalization of NPs44 and syntheses of a variety of metallic, semiconducting,
and porous carbon-based nanostructures.42,45 For example,
Pethsangave et al.46 described a novel
route using DES-assisted functionalization of GR and their potential
application as an effective flame-retardant material. Recently, Guan
et al.47 fabricated a porous carbon–GO
composite using eutectic mixture composed of phosphoric acid (85%
in water, PA), ethylamine hydrochloride (EA), and glycerol (Gly) in
a 1:2:1 molar ratio. However, DES-assisted surface functionalization
and synthesis of a metal NP-supported GO-based hybrid nanocomposite
have not been explored enough.

In this work, we designed a facile
and green synthetic approach
for the controlled synthesis of a 3D GO/Au NS hybrid nanocomposite
using ChCl/urea (molar ratio of 1:2)-based DES as a large-area SERS
substrate. DES can be used as an effective solvent and template for
surface functionalization of NH2 groups on GO and also
to support Au NSs on the GO surface to form 3D hybrid nanostructures.
Owing to the unique 3D structure, the resultant GO/Au NS hybrid nanocomposite
manifests greatly enhanced SERS performance for detection of crystal
violet (CV) probe molecules with concentration as low as 10–11 M and reproducible SERS signals. This DES-assisted synthetic approach
to controlled synthesis, and assembly of Au NSs onto GO nanosheets
has several advantages such as eco-friendly, large-scale synthesis,
high control over uniformity, and economic feasibility in comparison
with other standard ionic liquid-assisted synthesis and wet-chemical
synthetic routes.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis and Structural Studies of the 3D
GO/Au NS Hybrid Nanocomposite
As schematically shown in Figure 1, the hybrid 3D GO/Au
NS nanocomposite was prepared by two-step synthetic steps using ChCl/urea
(ratio of 1:2)-based DES as the solvent. In the first step, the GO
nanosheets were uniformly dispersed in DES, followed by controlled
functionalization of −NH groups on GO. For this purpose, the
GO nanosheets were first treated with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane
(APTES) in order to facilitate the amine (NH2) group-terminated
surface through reacting NH2 groups of APTES with carboxylic
groups of GO surfaces using DES as the solvent at 60 °C. In the
second step, uniform Au NSs (size of 150−200 nm) were synthesized
separately in DES using the HAuCl4 precursor and l-AA as reducing agents at 60 °C. The as-synthesized Au NSs are
surface-passivated by Cl– because of the presence
of a large amount of Cl– in the ChCl/urea-based
DES.48 The presynthesized Au NSs were functionalized
onto NH2-terminated surfaces through covalent coupling.
Notably, in the presence of the dense NH2-functionalized
surface of GO, the Au NSs tend to assemble into a one-dimensional
(1D) chain-like structure. Previous studies demonstrated that the
passivation of Cl– onto Au NSs shows the strong
affinity between two adjacent particles, which also trigger assembly
into a chain-like structure.49,50 In the present synthesis,
both surface-functionalized NH2 groups and surface-passivated
Cl– ions onto Au NSs favor the formation of a 1D
assembled structure on the GO surface. To understand the synthesis
better, we performed an additional one-step experiment by surface
functionalization of APTES and subsequent in situ reduction of Au3+ into Au on GO nanosheets by keeping all other conditions
the same. The resultant composite showed that flower-shaped Au nanostructures
are effectively supported over the GO nanosheets (Figure S1, Supporting Information), in which no ID assembly
was observed, suggesting that the Cl–-passivated
Au NSs can play an important role in 1D assembly over GO.

Figure 1 Schematic illustration
of the steps involved in the fabrication
of Au NS assembly onto the GO nanosheets in a ChCl/urea (1:2 ratio)-based
DES.

The morphology of the as-synthesized 3D GO/Au NS
samples was characterized
using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) analysis. Figure 2a,b shows the SEM image of the 3D GO/Au NSs, which
revealed the formation of a porous 3D-like structure, in which the
Au NSs were supported over GO nanosheets. In addition, the energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping analysis demonstrated that the C,
O, and Au elements are uniformly distributed as shown in Figure 2c–f, further
suggesting the uniform dispersion of Au NSs on GO supports. Furthermore,
EDS elemental analysis presented in Figure S2 also confirms the existence of only C, O, Si, and Au peaks, indicating
that no additional elements are present in the hybrid nanocomposite.
It should be noted that the existence of Si peaks in the sample indication
of successful APTES-functionalized GO nanosheets.

NS nanocomposite. (c–f) Scanning TEM and corresponding EDS

Figure 3a,b shows
the TEM images of the obtained pristine Au NSs using DES as the solvent,
which displays highly uniform Au NSs with an average size ranging
between 150 and 200 nm. Figure 3d presents the TEM image of pristine GO nanosheets utilized
for supporting Au NSs, which showed that the highly smooth surface
is estimated to be 2–5 μM in length and ca. 200 nm in
thickness. The TEM images of the 3D GO/Au NS hybrid nanocomposite
are displayed in Figure 3e,f. As can be seen from Figure 3e,f, the uniform Au NSs are effectively supported over
the GO nanosheets, in which Au NSs are assembled as 1D chain-like
structures. In addition, a close observation of Figure 3f shows that the GO nanosheets are transformed
into 3D porous structures after surface functionalization and decoration
of Au NSs in DES. The TEM results are in good agreement with the SEM
images in Figure 2.

of 150–200 nm and (b) self-assembled Au NSs. (c,d) TEM images
of pristine GO nanosheets and (e,f) 3D GO/Au NS nanocomposite, respectively.

To further demonstrate the structural details,
the atomic force
microscopy (AFM) analysis was also performed. Figure 4a–d displays the AFM images of the
single GO nanosheet and 3D GO/Au NS hybrid nanocomposite and corresponding
line profiles. As can be seen from the AFM topographical image of
the pristine GO sheet in Figure 4a, a thin layered GO structure with a smooth surface
was observed. The surface height profile was scanned across the single
GO nanosheet (Figure 4c), which revealed that the thickness is about ∼1.25 nm and
the size is about 1 μM. Figure 4b shows the typical AFM image of the GO/Au NS hybrid
nanocomposite, which showed that some Au NSs are attached onto the
surface of GO as can be visualized as bright spots. The structure
of the Au NSs is not clearly visible, which may be due to the presence
of the sharp edges in the Au NSs and porous structure of the support.
The corresponding line-profile analyses scanned across the Au NSs
in the resultant nanocomposite indicate that the height of Au NSs
is about 200 nm (Figure 4d). Interestingly, a close observation of Figure 4b shows the formation of a 3D structure,
which is in good agreement with the SEM and TEM results. The AFM results
further support the successful incorporation of Au NSs over GO and
formation of a 3D hybrid structure in the resultant sample.

image of pristine GO nanosheets and 3D
GO/Au NS nanocomposite, respectively. (c,d) Corresponding line-profile
analysis of the region highlighted as a white color line in figure
(a,b).

To understand the structure and interaction in
the GO/Au NS nanocomposite,
we applied various spectroscopic characterization techniques. Figure 5a shows the UV–vis
absorption spectra of the GO nanosheets, pristine Au NSs, and 3D GO/Au
NS hybrid nanocomposite samples. The Au NSs exhibit two absorption
peaks at 547 nm and a less intense peak at around 300 nm, indicating
the LSPR peaks of an anisotropic Au NS.48 After supporting Au NSs over GO nanosheets, the appearance of both
peaks of Au NSs and GO nanosheets suggests the effective formation
of GO/Au NS hybrid nanocomposites. The powder X-ray diffraction (p-XRD)
of GO and the GO/Au NS composite is shown in Figure 5b. The GO nanosheets exhibit a sharp peak
at 2θ = 9.85°, which is ascribed to the d-spacing of 8.97 Å for the (001) plane.51 In comparison with GO, the obtained GO/Au NS nanocomposite samples
display four additional peaks at 2θ = 38, 44.3, 64.45, and 77.3°,
which are assigned to the (111), (200), (220), and (311) planes of
the face-centered cubic (fcc) structure of Au.52

Figure 5 (a) UV–vis absorption spectra of GO nanosheets, Au NSs,
and 3D GO/Au NS nanocomposites. (b) XRD pattern of bare GO and the
3D GO/Au NS hybrid nanocomposite.

Raman spectroscopy was used to examine the crystalline
structure
of the obtained pristine GO and GO/Au NS nanocomposite (Figure S3, Supporting Information). It is noticed from Figure S3a that the GO nanosheets exhibit a G-band
peak at 1591 cm–1, which is higher relative to the
original G-band peak of graphite (1685 cm–1).53 In addition, after decoration of Au NSs, the
intensity of the Raman peaks increased, and a slight negative shift
in the G-band peak from 1691 to 1578 cm–1 was observed.
These changes are attributed to the strong enhancement of plasmonic
effect caused by the supported Au NSs in the GO/Au NS nanocomposite
sample.52 Furthermore, Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectra of the GO/Au NS nanocomposite were compared
with those of the pristine GO nanosheets, as shown in Figure S3b (Supporting Information). The FTIR spectra of
functionalized GO nanosheets showed several peaks such as hydroxyl
bending vibrations (C–OH, 3326 cm–1), carbon–ketone
bonds (1724 cm–1), C=C stretching vibrations
of aromatic carbon atoms (C=O, 1656 cm–1),
stretching vibrations of epoxide bonds (C–O–C, 1370
cm–1), and C=H bending and C–O stretching
vibrations (1194 and 1039 cm–1), respectively.54 The peak positions are well consistent with
the previous report of GO nanosheets.53 After supporting Au NSs onto the GO sheets, significant reduction
in the intensity of the peak at 1724 cm–1 and slight
decrement in the peaks at 1587 and 3326 cm–1 are
associated with the C=O and O–H stretching vibrations,
indicating the reduction of oxygen groups, which confirm the effective
interaction of Au NSs with the GO nanosheets in the resultant composite.55

Furthermore, the oxidation states and
chemical interaction between
Au NSs and GO were further investigated using X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. Figure 6a shows that the high-resolution XPS spectrum for the
C 1s region is fitted to three peaks. The prominent peak at 285.40
eV, which can be assigned to the C–N bonds, arose from the
amine functionalization in the GO structure, while other two weak
peaks at 286.80 and 289.60 eV, corresponding to the carbon–oxygen
bonds (C–O–O or C–OH) and carboxylic acid groups
(C=O), indicate the oxidized form of the sp2 atomic
structure of the graphene.53,55,56Figure 6b shows that
the O 1s XPS spectrum is fitted with two peaks at 532.7 and 530.6
eV, which are assigned to the C–O and C=O bonds, respectively.
The N 1s XPS spectrum of the GO/Au NS hybrid nanocomposite in Figure 6c showed two peaks
at 400.54 and 404.40 eV, corresponding to the carbon–amine
bonds (C–N) and quaternary nitrogen atoms.55 The Au 4f XPS spectrum of the GO/Au NS nanocomposite sample
is presented in Figure 6d. It exhibits peaks at 83.87 and 87.76 eV, which are assigned to
the Au 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 core levels of metallic
Au (Au0), whereas other less intense peaks at 84.86 and
89.88 eV correspond to the Au 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 core levels of the unreduced form of Au (Au3+), respectively.
Notably, the presence of less intense peaks at 84.86 and 89.88 eV,
suggesting that the majority of Au are present in the metallic state
(Au0).

2.2 SERS Performance of the GO/Au NS Hybrid Nanocomposite
It is well-known that, in comparison with the bare Au NSs, the
GO/Au NS nanocomposite can produce much stronger SERS signal because
of the synergetic effect of both EM and CMEM.34,57,58 Furthermore, controlled assembly of Au NSs
over GO nanosheets can provide a large amount of inherent SERS “hotspots”
because of the existence of gaps between the adjacent Au NSs, thereby
generating extremely intense EM field at the conjunctions, resulting
in remarkable enhancement in the overall SERS signal response.59 Thus, the SERS substrate fabricated using the
as-synthesized 3D GO/Au NS hybrid nanocomposite is expected to exhibit
highly improved SERS performance. The SERS measurements were carried
out on the 3D GO/Au NS hybrid structure using a 633 nm excitation
laser source and most commonly employed probe molecules (CV). Owing
to its 3D structure, the GO/Au NS nanocomposite can enable to adsorb
the analyte probe molecules (CV) from aqueous solution, making it
possible to detect the specific analyte molecules from solution. Therefore,
first we performed the SERS analysis in an aqueous dispersed sample
with the same concentration, which was mixed with the aqueous solution
of CV and incubated for 2 h before the SERS measurements. The SERS
substrate of 3D GO/Au NSs showed higher SERS signals relative to the
pristine GO and pristine Au NSs, respectively (Figure S4, Supporting Information).

Furthermore, it
was well accepted that the SERS signal dramatically improved when
the Au NP deposited over any substrates by forming multiple inherent
“hotspots” over the substrates.20 Thus, substrate-based SERS measurements were carried out, and the
SERS performance was evaluated. For preparation of the SERS substrate,
a known amount of samples was deposited over the silicon (Si) substrates,
followed by depositing the analyte molecule, CV (10–6 M), by a simple drop-casting technique and dried well prior to SERS
analysis. To understand the SERS enhancement of the 3D GO/Au NS hybrid
nanocomposite-based SERS substrate, we have prepared two different
SERS substrates, and their SERS performance was compared with the
3D GO/Au NS nanocomposite. First, the spherical Au NPs (average size
of 9 nm) were uniformly decorated onto GO nanosheets (Figure S5a,b). Second, the Au NSs were simply
supported on GO nanosheets, without introduction of APTES functionalization
steps that contain the same concentration of Au NSs (Figure S5c,d). As shown in Figure 7a, the substrate fabricated with the 3D GO/Au
NS nanocomposite exhibited higher SERS signal intensity compared with
the other tested SERS substrates. The higher SERS signal for 3D GO/Au
NS nanocomposites can be due to the availability of a large amount
of SERS “hotspots” between two adjacent Au NSs and efficient
diffusion and adsorption of CV molecules in the 3D structure.

Figure 7 SERS performance
and sensitivity of the SERS substrates. (a) Comparison
of the SERS signal of the GO nanosheet, GO/Au NPs, Au NSs, GO/Au NSs,
and 3D GO/Au NSs and (b) corresponding SERS EFs. (c) Raman spectra
of CV probe molecules with varying concentrations from 10–6 to 10–11 M on the 3D GO/Au NS hybrid nanocomposite
and (d) corresponding linear calibration plot at the SERS peak at
1620 cm–1.

To evaluate the SERS performance of the 3D GO/Au
NS hybrid nanocomposite,
SERS EF was quantitatively estimated according to the previous report
of Meng et al.60 by using the following
equation 1  where ISERS and INor are the SERS signal intensities of the CV-adsorbed
GO/Au NS substrate and normal Raman spectra of CV at the prominent
peak at 1620 cm–1 and NSERS and NNor represent the corresponding
number of CV molecules in the focused incident laser spot. It should
be mentioned that it is extremely difficult to calculate the number
of analyte molecules adsorbed onto the substrate and the number of
CV molecules present at the laser irradiation site. Thus, by assuming
uniform distribution of CV molecules over the GO/Au NS hybrid substrates,
the substituted values of NSERS and NNor by the concentration of CV subjected to
obtain SERS spectra and the normal Raman spectra of CV (without substrate)
are 1.0 × 10–6 and 1.0 × 10–3 M, respectively (Figure S6, Supporting Information).

Figure 7b
compares
the calculated SERS EFs for different obtained SERS substrates. The
EF for 3D GO/Au NSs is about 1.7 × 105, which is higher
relative to the GO/Au NSs (1.6 × 105), Au NSs (1.1
× 105), and GO/Au NPs (0.3 × 105),
respectively. The greater SERS EFs of the fabricated 3D GO/Au NS hybrid
nanocomposite are due to the following parameters: (i) the assembly
of uniform Au NSs over GO can provide a large number of gaps between
two adjacent Au NSs, which serves as “hotspots” for
SERS signal enhancement, and (ii) the 3D structure of the GO/Au NS
nanocomposite permits the analyte molecule (CV) to diffuse inside
the pores or cavities, which could produce stable SERS signals. The
sensitivity of the substrates was estimated using the CV molecule
that was adsorbed onto the GO/Au NS hybrid nanocomposite by varying
the CV concentration. Figure 7c displays the Raman spectra obtained by varying the CV concentration
from 10–6 to 10–11 M. As can be
seen from Figure 7c,
the Raman intensity increases gradually with increasing concentration
from 10–11 to 10–6 M, and even
at 10–11 M of CV concentration, the Raman peak was
observed. In addition, the changes of the Raman intensity at a prominent
peak at 1620 cm–1 were plotted as a function of
CV concentration (Figure 7d), revealing the linear dependence. Importantly, the observed
sensitivity is greater or comparable with the previous report of the
GO/metal NP hybrid nanocomposite as summarized in Table S1, suggesting the excellent sensitivity of the fabricated
3D GO/Au NS hybrid nanocomposite-based SERS substrate.

The reproducibility
of the substrate is another important parameter
for SERS-active substrates for their applications in various platforms.61 Thus, two different reproducibility tests were
performed, and their reproducibility was evaluated. First, spot-to-spot
Raman scanning in the same substrate was examined to evaluate the
SERS reproducibility. Figure 8a depicts the Raman spectra of 15 random spots in the same
substrates. The SERS intensities for 15 obtained SERS spectra are
highly uniform, indicating that the SERS substrate is highly reproducible
and stable. To quantitatively evaluate the SERS reproducibility, we
estimated the relative standard deviation (RSD) of a prominent peak
of the CV peak at 1620 cm–1 for 15 SERS spectra
(Figure 8b). The RSD
value is estimated to be ∼13.2%, which suggests the excellent
SERS reproducibility of the as-fabricated SERS substrate. Second,
the substrate-to-substrate reproducibility of the 3D GO/Au NS substrate
is carried out by collecting a SERS signal from eight different substrates
with the same condition. Figure 8c shows the SERS spectra of eight different substrates
with the same CV concentration (10–6 M). The RSD
of the Raman intensity of the most prominent peak for CV at 1620 cm–1 is calculated to be ∼11.4%. This value is
significantly lower than the maximum threshold RSD for any SERS-active
substrate, which is determined to be about 20%,61 which indicates the outstanding reproducibility of the
designed substrates. Furthermore, the stability of the fabricated
GO/Au NS hybrid nanocomposite substrate was evaluated by collecting
the SERS spectra under continuous laser irradiation at the same spot
(Figure S7, Supporting Information). As
can be observed in Figure S7, the prominent
Raman peak intensity at 1620 cm–1 of the probe molecule
(CV) gradually decreases with the repeated irradiation by the laser
beam, and the SERS peaks are visualized after six irradiation cycles
at the same site of the substrate, suggesting reasonable stability
of the substrate. The decrease in the SERS signal upon continuous
irradiation can be understood by the fact that damage of the laser
irradiation site on the substrate as well as due to partial degradation
of CV molecules.

3 Conclusions
In summary, an eco-friendly
route to fabricate a 3D GO/Au NS hybrid
nanocomposite using choline chloride/urea (1:2 molar ratio)-based
DES as an efficient substrate for SERS-based molecular sensing is
reported. Specifically, the NH-functionalized GO was decorated with
Au NSs of size ranging between 150−200 nm by an ex situ synthesis
route using nonaqueous DES. DES was found to play an important role
as both a solvent and soft template for controlled surface functionalization
of GO nanosheets with −NH2 groups and subsequent
formation of a 3D GO/Au NS hybrid nanocomposite. Importantly, the
SERS substrate fabricated using the 3D GO/Au NS hybrid nanocomposite
exhibited enhanced SERS activity and stability for the detection of
a probe molecule (CV) with high sensitivity of CV concentration as
low as 10–11 M. Furthermore, the SERS substrate
showed excellent stability and reproducibility with a small RSD of
13.2%. The excellent SERS performance of the 3D GO/Au NS nanocomposite
is mainly related to the presence of abundant SERS “hotspots”
in the composite as well as 3D morphology. Furthermore, the 3D morphological
features allowed for the CV molecule to diffuse into the porous structure,
resulting in a stable and reproducible SERS signal. This green, DES-assisted
synthetic approach to design 3D hybrid nanocomposites is expected
to be a promising platform for controlled fabrication of GO-based
hybrid nanocomposites in a nonaqueous environment for their potential
applications in SERS-based sensing.

Graphite powder, potassium
permanganate (KMnO4), sulfuric acid (H2SO4), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), choline
chloride (ChCl), urea, chloroauric acid (HAuCl4·4H2O, 99.9%), l-ascorbic acid (AA, 99%), sodium borohydride
(NaBH4, >98%), APTES (99%), and CV (90%) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich, Mexico. All the chemicals were utilized as received,
and all the glasswares were washed thoroughly using deionized (DI)
water prior to their use in experiments.

4.2 Synthesis of GO Nanosheets
GO was
synthesized from graphite powder by following a modified Hummer’s
method.62 Briefly, 2 g of graphite powder
was dispersed in 46 mL of H2SO4 at 0 °C,
followed by the addition of 6 g of KMnO4. The mixture was
heated to 35 ± 2 °C under vigorous stirring and reacted
for 2 h. After that, 92 mL of distilled water (R =
15 MΩ·cm) was slowly added to the reaction mixture and
kept under magnetic stirring for 15 min. The reaction was terminated
by transferring the mixture to a beaker containing H2O2 at 1% to remove the remaining MnO4–. For further purification, the mixture was washed using centrifugation
first with 1% HCl and then with distilled water several times at 3000
rpm for 5 min. The resulting GO was dried for 12 h at 65 °C,
and then GO powder was exfoliated in a sonication bath (Bransonic
1510, 40 KHz) in 10 mg/mL of water for 3 h to obtain a brown-colored
GO nanosheet dispersion.

4.3 Preparation of ChCl/Urea-Based DES
Choline chloride (ChCl)/urea-derived DES (molar ratio of 1:2) was
prepared using the previously reported protocol.63 Prior to the preparation, ChCl was heated to 90 °C
for 2 h in a vacuum oven in order to dry the moisture content if any.
DES was obtained by mixing ChCl/urea with a molar ratio of 1:2, followed
by heating the mixture at 80 °C for 2 h, and then a colorless
liquid is obtained. After that, the formed DES was cooled down to
room temperature, closed tightly, and then saved in an ambient condition
for further synthesis.

4.4 DES-Assisted Synthesis of the 3D GO/Au NS
Nanocomposite
The Au NSs were first synthesized following
our previously reported protocol.48 Briefly,
10 mg of gold precursor (HAuCl4·4H2O) was
added to 20 mL of freshly prepared DES and magnetically stirred at
60 °C until a homogeneous dispersion was obtained. Separately,
50 mg of l-AA was mixed with 10 mL of DES solution and then
magnetically stirred at 60 °C until AA was completely dissolved.
Then, the DES-containing l-AA solution was quickly added
to the reaction mixture and magnetically stirred for another 30 min
in a closed environment. The yellow-colored solution mixtures immediately
turned transparent and then slowly changed into a dark brown color,
suggesting the formation of Au NSs. The resultant Au NS was separated
by adding an equal amount of DI water and centrifuged at 7000 rpm
for 15 min 4 times.

For the preparation of GO/Au NSs, 5 mg of
presynthesized clean GO nanosheet powder was dispersed in 20 mL of
DES and magnetically stirred at 60 °C for 15 min to obtain a
well-dispersed GO/DES mixture. Then, 0.1 mL of APTES solution was
slowly added into the reaction and magnetically stirred at 60 °C
for 6 h to obtain NH2-terminated GO nanosheets. After that,
10 mg of presynthesized Au NSs was added to the reaction under magnetic
stirring for another 30 min to obtain 3D GO/Au NS nanocomposites.
The resultant product was cleaned and separated using the similar
steps as that used for Au NSs. In a typical in situ synthesis of GO/Au
NSs, 5 mg of GO nanosheets was dispersed in 20 mL of DES, and 0.1
mL of APTES was added into the solution mixture and magnetically stirred
at 60 °C for 6 h. After that, 10 mg of the HAuCl4 precursor
was added to the solution mixture and magnetically stirred for another
30 min. Subsequently, 50 mg of AA was dissolved separately in 10 mL
of DES, and the l-AA-containing DES was added to the solution
mixture and magnetically stirred for 30 min. The final product was
separated by the same protocol used for the ex situ synthesis.

4.5 Characterization Techniques
The morphology
of the Au NSs and GO/Au NS samples was analyzed by TEM using a JEOL
JEM-1010 microscope operating at 80 kV. The samples for TEM measurement
were prepared by dispersing the colloidal nanostructures over carbon-coated
Cu grids and subsequent drying at room temperature overnight. The
AFM of the samples was carried out using a Bruker (scanAsyst-Air model)
AFM microscope operating in tapping mode. For AFM analysis, the dispersed
samples were deposited onto the Si substrate and dried at ambient
conditions. UV–vis spectra of the samples were recorded with
an Agilent 8453 UV–vis spectrophotometer. The XRD patterns
were obtained with an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Ultima IV, using
Cu Kα radiation) using parallel-beam geometry with 2θ
scan between 20 and 80°. The XPS spectra of the samples were
obtained using an XPS spectrometer (Intercovamex-XPS110) using nonmonochromatic
Al Kα (1486.7 eV) X-ray source. All the recorded XPS spectra
were corrected utilizing the C 1s line at 284.8 eV. Infrared transmittance
spectra (FTIR) of the samples were collected from a Thermo Scientific
(NICOLET 6700) spectrometer, equipped with a universal ATR accessory
in the spectral range of 4000–650 cm–1. Raman
and SERS spectra of the samples were collected utilizing a Bruker
(SENTERRA) Raman spectrometer equipped with a He–Ne laser of
633 nm excitation wavelength (λex).

4.6 SERS Measurements
Solution-based
SERS performance was carried out by the same amount of as-synthesized
GO/Au NS hybrid nanocomposite samples (1 mg/mL in DI water) that were
mixed with 25 μL of an aqueous solution of CV with a concentration
of 10–6 M by magnetic stirring for 2 h. After that,
the solution containing CV-adsorbed samples was then transferred to
a glass cuvette to collect the SERS spectra. For the substrate-based
SERS measurements, the samples of the same concentrations (1 mg/mL)
were first dispersed in a DI water using sonication for 30 min, and
then 0.1 mL of well-dispersed samples was drop-casted over silicon
(Si) wafer (8 mm × 8 mm). After that, 25 μL of an aqueous
CV solution (10–6 M) was dropped over the sample
and dried under the ambient condition. The CV deposited substrates
were then washed with DI water and dried prior to the SERS analysis.
Raman spectra were collected using an excitation wavelength of 633
nm He–Ne laser with a laser power of 4.7 mW under 50×
lens, and the signal acquisition time was fixed at 2 s for all samples.
