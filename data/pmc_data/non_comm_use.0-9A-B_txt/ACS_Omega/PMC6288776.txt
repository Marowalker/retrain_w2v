Platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) are
antioxidant enzyme-mimetic nanomaterials
with significant potential for the treatment of complex diseases related
to oxidative stress. Among such diseases, Cerebral Cavernous Malformation
(CCM) is a major cerebrovascular disorder of genetic origin, which
affects at least 0.5% of the general population. Accumulated evidence
indicates that loss-of-function mutations of the three known CCM genes
predispose endothelial cells to oxidative stress-mediated dysfunctions
by affecting distinct redox-sensitive signaling pathways and mechanisms,
including pro-oxidant and antioxidant pathways and autophagy. A multitargeted
combinatorial therapy might thereby represent a promising strategy
for the effective treatment of this disease. Herein, we developed
a multifunctional nanocarrier by combining the radical scavenging
activity of PtNPs with the autophagy-stimulating activity of rapamycin
(Rapa). Our results show that the combinatorial targeting of redox
signaling and autophagy dysfunctions is effective in rescuing major
molecular and cellular hallmarks of CCM disease, suggesting its potential
for the treatment of this and other oxidative stress-related diseases.

Introduction
Multifactorial diseases,
such as cerebrovascular pathologies, require
complex therapeutic approaches based on the combination of different
drugs simultaneously directed at multiple targets to achieve synergy
and efficient therapeutic response.1−4 Among cerebrovascular diseases, Cerebral
Cavernous Malformation (CCM) has emerged as a major health issue,
affecting approximately 24 million people worldwide.5−7 CCM is characterized by vascular lesions consisting of abnormally
dilated and fragile blood capillaries, mainly occurring in the central
nervous system, which expose to a lifetime risk of seizures, focal
neurological deficits, and hemorrhagic stroke.5−8 Genetic studies have demonstrated
that CCM is caused by loss-of-function mutation in three CCM genes
(KRIT1/CCM1, CCM2, and CCM3)9 implicated
in the maintenance of endothelial cell–cell junction stability
and blood–brain barrier (BBB) integrity.10 Growing evidence suggests that multiple factors contribute
to CCM disease pathogenesis and its highly variable expressivity.11 Indeed, it has been shown that loss-of-function
of CCM genes affects major pleiotropic mechanisms involved in cellular
redox homeostasis and defense against oxidative stress, including
the fine-tuned crosstalk between redox signaling and autophagy.10 In particular, a recent report demonstrates
that KRIT1 loss-of-function causes defective autophagy and consequent
molecular and cellular abnormalities, including accumulation of the
autophagy adapter p62, and abnormal persistence of dysfunctional mitochondria,
leading to a strong increase in intracellular levels of reactive oxygen
species (ROS).12−14 Importantly, these findings have opened novel perspectives
for the pharmacological treatment of CCM disease, suggesting that
a promising possibility would be the development of a combinatorial
treatment that may simultaneously and synergistically target autophagic
dysfunction and antioxidant deficiency.10,14 Consistently,
all the potential therapeutic compounds for CCM disease proposed so
far, including statins,15N-acetylcysteine,16,17 fasudil,18 tempol,19 vitamin D3,19 sulindac derivatives,20 rapamycin
(Rapa),12 and avenanthramides,21,22 are endowed with either autophagy-inducing or antioxidant properties
or both.10,13,14

To address
the possibility of developing a combinatorial treatment
simultaneously targeting redox signaling and autophagic dysfunction,
we developed a multifunctional nanocarrier, composed of rapamycin-functionalized
platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs). This multifunctional nanocarrier combines
the intrinsic antioxidant activity of PtNPs23−26 and the autophagy-stimulating
activity of rapamycin.12 PtNPs are known
to act as artificial antioxidant enzymes (nanozymes) and have proven
strong antioxidant activity in cellular models of CCM disease, being
able to restore their physiological ROS homeostasis.27 Moreover, the nanocarrier may allow the improvement of
the cellular delivery of rapamycin, which is characterized by poor
solubility in aqueous media, limiting its use as a free drug.28−30 Using established cellular models of CCM disease, we demonstrated
that the combinatorial and synergistic pro-autophagic and antioxidant
activities of the multifunctional nanocarrier were highly effective
in rescuing major molecular and cellular phenotypes caused by KRIT1
loss-of-function, including defective autophagy, altered ROS homeostasis,
and endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMt), suggesting promising
therapeutic applications.

Results and Discussion
Preparation and Characterization
of Platinum@BSA–Rapamycin
Nanocarrier (Pt5@Rapa NPs)
The multifunctional nanocarrier
was prepared using biocompatible, endotoxin-free, and highly catalytic
citrate-capped PtNPs of 5 nm, synthesized as previously reported.27 The radical scavenging activity of PtNPs was
recently proved to restore intracellular redox homeostasis in a cellular
model of CCM disease.27 Although the small
size of these NPs may limit their drug-loading capacity, their superior
antioxidant nanozyme properties (due to their high surface-to-volume
ratio) are particularly promising for the combinatorial treatment
of CCM.27 On the other hand, rapamycin
was selected for its proven efficacy in rescuing defective autophagy
in CCM cells.12 Because this drug has low
bioavailability,29 we exploited Bovine
Serum Albumin (BSA) to incorporate rapamycin within the hydrophobic
pockets of the protein in the attempt to improve its solubilization
and delivery, as well as to protect it from degradation.31Figure 1A illustrates our multifunctional platinum@BSA–rapamycin
nanocarrier (Pt5@Rapa NPs). In particular, citrate-capped PtNPs were
coated with two different thiols, one of them terminating with free
carboxylic groups for the covalent binding of BSA through its amine
groups, and the other one to provide colloidal stability to NPs during
the bioconjugation procedure (see Materials and Methods). Exposed carboxyls were activated by click chemistry and covalently
coupled to the primary amines of BSA via carbodiimide reaction. Drug
loading was performed by two approaches: co-incubation of NPs with
rapamycin and BSA or incubation of NPs with rapamycin-loaded BSA.
These procedures gave similar results, provided that a low concentration
of rapamycin is used to preserve the NP colloidal stability.

Right, overlay of optical and fluorescent acquisitions.

TEM analyses showed that Pt5 NPs were highly monodisperse
(Figure 1B), with a
size distribution
centered around 5 nm (Figure 1C). The size and the dispersion degree of Pt5@Rapa NPs were
investigated by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS). An increase in the
average hydrodynamic radius by 30 nm compared to Pt5 NPs was measured
(Supporting Information Table S1). Binding
of BSA on Pt5 NPs (Pt5@BSA) was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis
(Figure 1D). Pt5@BSA
NPs were retained in the agarose gel due to their higher molecular
weight compared to nonfunctionalized Pt5 NPs, indicating the successful
conjugation of the protein to the NPs. However, because BSA has molecular
size comparable to our Pt5 NPs, only few BSA proteins can be conjugated
to each NP.32 Actually, fluorescence analysis
showed that each Pt5 NPs contained an average of 2 conjugated molecules
of BSA. Furthermore, as probed by UV–vis, we estimated that
each nanocarrier transported about two molecules of rapamycin. Although
our nanovector had low drug loading capacity (few rapamycin molecules
per NP), such bioconjugation conditions represented a good compromise
between NP stability and monodispersion, drug loading, and high antioxidant
activity, all crucial features for our combinatorial therapeutic approach.

Pt5@Rapa NPs for Rapamycin Delivery
To test the activity
of the multifunctional rapamycin nanocarrier, we took advantage of
KRIT1-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells (KRIT1-KO MEFs),
an established cellular model of CCM disease characterized by impaired
autophagy and high levels of intracellular ROS.12,16,17 This cellular model is well suited for testing
combination approaches based on multifunctional nanocarriers. Several
studies demonstrated that treatments of these cells with distinct
compounds, endowed with antioxidant properties, were capable of recovering
increased intracellular ROS levels and altered redox signaling,16,17,22,27,33 whereas their treatment with rapamycin was
effective in rescuing also defective autophagy.12

We first assessed the toxicological profile of the
Pt5@Rapa nanocarriers on KRIT1-KO MEF cells. Specifically, the cytocompatibility
of Pt5@Rapa NPs was tested at concentrations up to 50 μg/mL
for 24 and 48 h, by WST-1 assay. Pt5@Rapa NPs were cytocompatible
on MEFs (Figure 2A),
indicating that Pt5 NP conjugation with rapamycin-loaded BSA does
not alter their toxicological profile. Moreover, we assessed Pt5@Rapa
NP cellular uptake and their intracellular fate by confocal microscopy.
Confocal images showed an efficient internalization of Pt5@Rapa NPs
and their compartmentalization within lysosomes (Figure 2B), confirming that NP uptake
occurs by endocytosis, as previously demonstrated for nonfunctionalized
citrate-capped Pt5 NPs.27 It has been demonstrated
that also rapamycin–polymer conjugates are taken up by the
endocytic pathway and compartmentalized within the lysosomes, where
the release of the drug takes place.28 Accordingly,
it is possible to speculate that, once endocytosed, the attack of
peptidases to Pt5@Rapa NPs within lysosomes may induce the release
of rapamycin from BSA, leading to rapamycin therapeutic action.

control. (D) Quantification of p62 on vinculin in KRIT1-KO MEFs, representative

DCF intensity of treated KRIT1-KO MEFs is expressed relative to untreated
KRIT1-KO MEFs. At least three independent experiments were performed.
Data are expressed as mean ± SD. Differences between treated
samples and the control were considered statistically significant
for p-values <0.05 (***p <
0.001).

The efficacy of Pt5@Rapa NPs as
rapamycin delivery system was tested
by quantifying the expression of p62, a typical autophagic marker
that accumulates when autophagy is inhibited. The total level of p62
was quantified in lysates of KRIT1-KO MEFs treated with Pt5 or Pt5@Rapa
NPs. In parallel, cells were treated with free rapamycin, at a concentration
known to restore the physiological p62 expression of wild-type cells
(Supporting Information Figure S1).12 Western blot analysis revealed that the accumulation
of p62 significantly decreased upon cell treatment with Pt5@Rapa NPs
(Figure 2C,D), indicating
that rapamycin delivered by the nanocarrier is able to restore cell
autophagy with similar efficiency as the free drug. On the contrary,
no change in the level of p62 expression was detected in cells treated
with nonfunctionalized Pt5 NPs, demonstrating that Pt5 NPs itself
does not interfere with autophagy, unlike some reports with other
metal NPs.34−36 These findings demonstrate that PtNP-assisted rapamycin
delivery is effective to elicit a therapeutic effect comparable to
the free drug, even at a lower drug concentration. It can be hypothesized
that rapamycin encapsulation within NPs might also have contributed
to its efficacy by protecting it from the degradation and improving
its internalization within the cells. Consistent with our findings,
the use of rapamycin-loaded nanoparticles has been shown to target
defective autophagy in muscular dystrophy and to enhance both skeletal
muscle strength and cardiac contractile performance, which is not
achievable with conventional oral rapamycin, even in pharmacological
doses.37

Pt5@Rapa NPs as Antioxidant
Nanocarriers
Citrate-capped
Pt5 NPs were recently found to restore ROS homeostasis in KRIT1-KO
MEFs.27 To assess the ROS scavenging activity
of Pt5@Rapa NPs, KRIT1-KO MEFs were treated with citrate-capped Pt5,
Pt5, Pt5@Rapa NPs, or free rapamycin and ROS levels were quantified
by the dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) assay. Both
Pt5 NPs and the multifunctional nanocarrier exhibited high ROS scavenging
potential, which was comparable to that of nonfunctionalized citrate-capped
Pt5 NPs, even though their surface is partially covered by thiols
and BSA (Figure 2E).
This suggests that the coating does not interfere with the catalytic
reactions (as discussed above, it is likely that BSA molecules are
degraded once in the lysosomal environment). Within the intracellular
environment, Pt5@Rapa NPs exert significant antioxidant activity,
directly reducing the ROS species, unlike free rapamycin that indirectly
regulates the ROS levels by acting on autophagy pathways that control
the clearance of ROS-generating dysfunctional mitochondria.38 Therefore, the drug itself has a weak antioxidant
activity. Consistently, additive effect of rapamycin within the nanovector
was not detectable, probably due to its lower concentration on the
nanocarrier compared to that of the free drug. These results demonstrated
that our nanocarrier is also an efficient modulator of ROS homeostasis
in a cellular model of CCM disease, confirming its potential as multifunctional
nanovector for combination therapy.

Pt5@Rapa NPs as Angiogenesis
Modulator
CCM proteins
play a major role in the maintenance of endothelial cell–cell
junction stability and blood–brain barrier (BBB) integrity
through the tight modulation of the interplay between autophagy and
redox homeostasis and signaling.10,14,15,39−43 By impairing autophagy and dysregulating ROS homeostasis, loss-of-function
of CCM genes, including KRIT1, causes EndMt,12,20,44 a process whereby endothelial cells lose
their specific markers and cell–cell contacts, weakening their
barrier function.45 In light of this mechanism,
we tested the efficacy of our multifunctional nanocarrier to attenuate
or reverse EndMt and re-establish physiological angiogenesis of KRIT1-depleted
endothelial cells, comparing its effect with that of rapamycin alone
or PtNPs. Once verified the cytocompatibility of Pt5 NPs on wild-type
primary Human Umbelical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC) (Supporting
Information Figure S2), the effect of Pt5
NPs, rapamycin, and Pt5@Rapa NPs was evaluated on unsilenced and KRIT1-silenced
HUVECs (KRIT1-KO HUVECs) by an in vitro angiogenesis assay (Figure 3A). The formation
of a network of capillary-like structures on Matrigel was followed
over a period of 6–12 h after cellular exposure for 15 h to
treatments (Figure 3B,C). Normal angiogenesis was observed in all unsilenced cells, regardless
of the treatments. Conversely, KRIT1 knockdown completely impaired
cell ability to form capillary-like tube structures. This is in agreement
with previous reports showing that endothelial cells with the loss-of-function
of CCM genes fail to organize into well-formed capillary-like networks.46 Interestingly, KRIT1-KO HUVECs exposed to Pt5
NPs developed some capillary-like structures, demonstrating that PtNPs
can promote the partial recovery of the endothelial phenotype of KRIT1-silenced
HUVECs. This might be attributed to the intrinsic property of Pt5
NPs to act as antioxidant nanozymes, being ROS homeostasis crucial
for normal endothelial cell function and signaling.47 As expected, also rapamycin treatment was found to be effective
in reactivating some in vitro angiogenesis. Indeed, treatment with
rapamycin was previously demonstrated to reverse EndMt by increasing
the expression of key endothelial cell markers in KRIT1-KO endothelial
cells.12 However, neither the antioxidant
treatment with bare nanoparticles nor autophagy induction with rapamycin
alone was sufficient to fully inhibit EndMt and restore physiological
in vitro angiogenesis, further supporting the requirement of a combined
treatment with antioxidants and autophagy inducers. Remarkably, KRIT1-KO
HUVECs treated with Pt5@Rapa NPs were able to undergo in vitro angiogenesis
almost comparably to unsilenced cells, thus demonstrating the synergistic
effect of the combination of the two therapeutic activities.

NPs, 500 nM rapamycin, or 50 μg/mL of Pt5@Rapa NPs. All the
data are presented as mean ± SD. (C) Representative images of
one of three independent experiments of capillary networks visualized

A possible model of the molecular mechanism of Pt5@Rapa NPs
in
KRIT1-KO endothelial cells is reported in Figure 4C. Specifically, the loss-of-function of
KRIT1 strongly affects autophagy, leading to the aberrant accumulation
of p62 and causing an increase in intracellular ROS and the EndMt
switch (Figure 4A).
Cell treatment with rapamycin reactivates autophagy, thereby decreasing
p62 accumulation, partially reducing the ROS levels and reverting
the EndMt switch (Figure 4B). On the other hand, given the intrinsic ROS-scavenging
activity of the Pt5 NPs core and the pro-autophagic activity of the
conjugated rapamycin, Pt5@Rapa NPs can directly counteract both increased
intracellular ROS levels and defective autophagy, thus exerting synergistic
effects that efficiently limit the major molecular and cellular dysfunctions
associated with defective autophagy, including ROS overproduction
and EndMt. Such a combined action allows endothelial cells to reacquire
their specific phenotype and function (Figure 4C). Hence, the synergism of Pt5@Rapa NPs
demonstrates the superiority of the combinatorial approach over the
targeting of single molecular pathways, suggesting that NP-based combinatorial
therapies may represent a promising strategy to treat CCM disease.
Furthermore, it is also possible to speculate that the leaky/abnormal
nature of CCM vasculature would favor NP-based drug delivery in vivo
because NPs may accumulate at the level of the lesions through the
enhanced permeability and retention phenomenon rather than penetrate
through tight endothelial junctions of normal blood vessels of other
tissues, minimizing systemic side effects and toxicity of the free
drug.48 In general, given their superior
performances over classical antioxidant compounds in terms of long-term
stability, prolonged action, and wider operational conditions,26,27 the multifunctional PtNPs developed in this work could be adapted
to targeted combination therapy approaches for other oxidative stress-related
diseases.

Figure 4 Schematic model of Pt5@Rapa NP mechanism of action in KRIT1-KO
cells. (A) KRIT1 loss-of-function impairs autophagy, leading to the
aberrant accumulation of autophagy adapter p62, which, in turn, enhances
intracellular ROS and promotes the EndMt switch, the two crucial events
that contribute to CCM progression. (B) Therapeutic reactivation of
autophagy with rapamycin in KRIT1-KO cells decreases p62 accumulation,
reduces intracellular accumulation of ROS, and inhibits the EndMt
switch. (C) PtNPs-based combinatorial treatment exerts synergistic
effects that enhances the efficacy of the therapeutic treatment. Pt5@Rapa
NPs in KRIT1-KO cells work as multifunctional nanoplatform simultaneously
acting as ROS-scavenging materials and drug nanocarriers. Pt5@Rapa
NPs counterbalance the increase in intracellular ROS levels through
their activity of antioxidant enzymes and deliver rapamycin into the
cells to decrease the aberrant accumulation of p62. Together, these
activities restore ROS homeostasis and inhibit EndMt with a higher
efficacy than the treatment with rapamycin alone.

Conclusions
In recent years, nanocarriers have emerged
as a promising tool
for the co-delivery of multiple drugs for the combination therapy
of complex diseases. Integrating multiple drugs in a single nanocarrier
has the advantages of beneficially overlapping the pharmacological
profiles of drugs, reduced toxicity, and ratiometric drug delivery
and offers the possibility to achieve maximum therapeutic synergy
and personalized treatments.49 Here, we
exploited the nanozyme properties and the versatile surface modification
of PtNPs to engineer a multifunctional drug delivery system with combined
antioxidant properties and autophagy-stimulating activity to prove
their therapeutic potential in combinatorial treatments. The CCM cellular
model represented a suitable benchmark to demonstrate the ability
of the multifunctional nanovector to work simultaneously as antioxidant
nanozyme and drug nanocarrier and the superiority of the combinatorial
treatment over single treatments with PtNPs or the free drug alone
in rescuing major phenotypic hallmarks of cellular models of CCM disease.
Our proof-of-concept study also suggests that PtNPs possess suitable
features to be considered for further investigations as multifunctional
nanocarriers in combinatorial treatments of CCM or other oxidative
stress-related complex diseases. The development of advanced delivery
systems, including those based on pickering emulsions,50 could be envisaged to attempt possible in vivo
translation of the proposed nanovector.

Materials and Methods
Synthesis
of Pt5 NPs
Immediately after the synthesis
of the citrate-capped Pt5 NPs,27 0.8 mL
of a solution 50 mM sodium 3-mercapto-1-propanesulfonate (Sigma-Aldrich),
and 2 mL of a solution 20 mM of 3-mercaptopropionic acid, MPA (Sigma-Aldrich),
were sequentially added to the reaction mixture. The solution was
kept under vigorous stirring for at least 1 h at 80 °C. Thiol
molecules form a self-assembled monolayer on the citrate-capped Pt5
NPs due to the high affinity of thiols for noble metals51−56 and the strong Pt–sulfur interaction.57,58 Afterward, the solution was cooled to room temperature, washed with
Milli-Q water using 50 K Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters, and stored
under 4 °C for future experiments. Pt5 NPs were then characterized
by dynamic light scattering (DLS) spectroscopy using a Zetasizer Nano
ZS System equipped with a 633 nm He–Ne laser (Malvern Instruments).

TEM Imaging of Pt5 NPs
The shape and the size of Pt5
NPs were analyzed using the TEM analysis. A dilute solution of PtNPs
dispersed in methanol was deposited on a carbon-coated grid and left
to dry in an oven. The TEM images of NPs were recorded by using a
JEOL JEM 1011 microscope. The size of PtNPs was determined by ImageJ
software, measuring the diameter of more than 300 NPs.

Preparation
of Platinum@BSA–Rapamycin Nanocarrier (Pt5@Rapa
NPs)
BSA conjugation with Pt5 NPs was carried out by a covalent
coupling of the carboxylic groups of the MPA layer with the primary
amines of BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) via carbodiimide chemistry. N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N-ethylcarbodiimide
hydrochloride (EDC) (Sigma-Aldrich, BioXtra) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) (Sigma-Aldrich) were used as cross-linking
agents. EDC was used to mediate the formation of peptide linkages
between BSA and MPA, and NHS for improving the reaction rate and efficiency.59

Activation of Pt5 NPs was carried out
using EDC and NHS as follows: 15 μL of a solution 30 mg/mL of
EDC and 15 μL of a solution 40 mg/mL of NHS were added to 1
mL of a solution 300 μg/mL of Pt5 NPs. The reaction mixture
was gently shaken for 5 min at room temperature. The excess of EDC/NHS
was immediately removed from the NP solution by centrifugation at
15 000 rcf for 30 min. Afterward, the supernatant was collected
in another vial, the pellet was resuspended in Milli-Q water, and
both the solutions were centrifuged again. This washing procedure
was repeated two more times. The NP solution was then resuspended
into 1 mL of PBS.

Pt5@Rapa nanovector was obtained by adding
simultaneously 100 μL
of a solution of 2 mg/mL of BSA and 20 μL of a solution 100
μM of rapamycin (CalbioChem) in dimethyl sulfoxide to 1 mL of
EDC/NHS-activated NPs. The solution was gently shaken and incubated
for 2 h at room temperature. The resultant Pt5@Rapa NPs were washed
twice with PBS at 15 000 rcf for 30 min to remove unconjugated
BSA and drug molecules. The hydrodynamic diameter of PtNPs was then
measured by DLS spectroscopy to confirm the successful bioconjugation.
For fluorescence analysis, BSA-conjugated PtNPs were prepared using
Alexa Fluor 647 conjugated BSA (A34785, Thermofisher).

Gel Electrophoresis
of Platinum@BSA NPs
Gel electrophoresis
was carried out for 20 min at 70 V on 0.6% agarose gel using sodium
boric acid buffer pH 8.5. Ten microliters of two solutions containing
50% glycerol and Pt5 or Pt5 NPs conjugated to fluorescent BSA was
loaded in each well. Images were taken with Typhoon Trio (GE).

Characterization
of Pt5@Rapa NPs
The number of BSA
molecules per PtNP has been quantified by fluorescence analysis comparing
the results with a fluorescent BSA standard calibration curve. A Infinite
200 Pro Tecan microplate reader was used for reading the BSA fluorescence
intensity, setting the excitation filter at 647 nm and the emission
filter at 680 nm.

The evaluation of the amount of rapamycin
per nanovector has been obtained indirectly by considering the number
of BSA per nanovector and their ability to load rapamycin. Rapamycin-loading
capacity of each BSA protein was calculated using UV–vis measurements.
BSA and rapamycin were incubated at equimolar ratio for the nanovector
synthesis. The amount of rapamycin that does not get trapped within
BSA is able to pass through the 3 K Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters
and then can be measured by UV–vis.

Cell Culture
Mouse
embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs)16 were cultivated
in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10%
(v/v) fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich), 100 U/mL penicillin, and
100 mg/mL streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich). Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial
Cells (HUVECs) were cultivated on 0.1% gelatin (Sigma-Aldrich) in
Medium 200 (Cascade Biologics—Invitrogen cell culture, Cat.
no. M-200-500) supplemented with Low Serum Growth supplement kit (Cascade
Biologics—Invitrogen cell culture, Cat. no. S-003-K). Cells
were incubated at 37 °C under a humidified controlled atmosphere
with 5% CO2. The HUVECs were used for experiments between
passages 2 and 6.

WST-1 Assay
In vitro toxicological
profile of Pt5 and
Pt5@Rapa NPs on MEFs and HUVECs was evaluated by WST-1 assay (Sigma-Aldrich)
according to the previously described method.60 Briefly, MEFs (25 000 cells/well) were plated in a 96-well
tissue culture plate in a final volume of 100 μL. After 24 h
of adhesion, the culture medium was removed and replaced with medium
containing Pt5 or Pt5@Rapa NPs at a concentration of 50 μg/mL,
up to 24 or 48 h. Afterward, the cells were washed three times with
PBS and incubated for 1 h with medium containing 10% WST. The HUVECs
(50 000 cells/well) were plated in a 96-well tissue culture
plate in a final volume of 100 μL. After 24 h of adhesion, the
culture medium was removed and replaced with medium containing a series
of Pt5 NPs dilutions ranging from 10 to 50 μg/mL, and the cells
were cultured for other 24 h. Afterward, the cells were washed three
times with PBS and incubated for 1 h with a medium containing 10%
WST. An Infinite 200 Pro Tecan microplate reader was used for reading
the cell viability results.

DCFH-DA Assay
MEFs (25 000
cells/well) were
plated in 96-well microplates (Constar) and exposed to 50 μg/mL
of citrate-capped Pt5, Pt5, Pt5@Rapa NPs, and 500 nM rapamycin. After
15 h, the cells were washed three times with PBS with Ca2+ and Mg2+ and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min with
5 μM DCFH-DA (Sigma) in PBS. An Infinite 200 Pro Tecan microplate
reader was used for reading the DCF fluorescence intensity, setting
the excitation filter at 480 nm and the emission filter at 520 nm.
The results were normalized with respect to untreated control cells.

Cell Transfection and siRNA-Mediated Gene Silencing
For
KRIT1 knockdown with small interfering RNA, the HUVECs were transfected
twice with a mix of 4× predesigned iBONi siRNA against KRIT1
(D-00101-Plus, Ribbox GmbH, Germany) or an iBONi siRNA negative control
(K-00301-0005-N3, Ribbox GmbH). HiPerFect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen)
was used according to manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly,
on the day of transfection, the HUVECs (2 × 105 cells/well)
were transfected in 6-well dishes with negative control siRNA or with
siRNA against KRIT1 at the final concentration of 120 nM (30 nM each
siRNA). The siRNA transfection procedure was repeated after 24 h to
enhance KRIT1 knockdown efficiency. KRIT1 silencing was monitored
by Western blotting analysis.

Western Blotting
The transfected HUVECs were lysed
in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer containing protease and phosphatase
inhibitor cocktails (Sigma-Aldrich) for 20 min on ice. After centrifugation
at 14 000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, the proteins were quantified
by Micro BCA Protein Assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Total cell
lysates containing equal amounts of total proteins (20 μg) were
separated by 10% mini-protean TGX precast acrylamide gels (Bio-rad
Laboratories) and electroblotted onto poly(vinylidene difluoride)
(PVDF) membranes (Bio-rad Laboratories).

MEFs (500 000
cells/well) treated for 15 h with 50 μg/mL of Pt5, Pt5@Rapa
NPs, or 500 nM rapamycin were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris
pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium dodecyl
sulfate, protease, and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Sigma-Aldrich)
for 20 min on ice. After centrifugation at 14 000 rpm for 10
min at 4 °C, the proteins were quantified by Micro BCA Protein
Assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Total cell lysates containing
equal amounts of total proteins (5 μg) were separated by 4–20%
mini-protean TGX precast acrylamide gels (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and
electroblotted onto PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The blots
were blocked with 5% nonfat milk (Sigma-Aldrich) in Tris-buffered
saline (TBS) containing 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature
and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies diluted
in TBS 1% BSA. The membranes were then washed three times with TBS
0.3% Tween 20 and incubated with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibodies (1:2500) in TBS 0.3% Tween 20 for 1 h at room
temperature. The proteins were visualized according to manufacturer’s
instruction by an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Bio-Rad)
with Typhoon Trio (GE). Protein band intensity was quantified by using
ImageJ software (NIH).

Antibodies
Rabbit polyclonal anti-P62/SQSTM1
antibody
(P0067, Sigma-Aldrich), rabbit recombinant monoclonal KRIT1 antibody
[EPR16560] (ab196025, Abcam), mouse monoclonal anti-vinculin antibody
(V9264, Sigma-Aldrich), and goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG (H
+ L)-HRP conjugated secondary antibodies (1706515, 1706515, Bio-Rad)
were used.

Confocal Microscopy
MEFs (10 000
cells/well)
cells were seeded in an 8-well chamber (VWR) and incubated at 37 °C
and 5% CO2. After 24 h, the cellular medium was removed
and replaced with 50 μg/mL Pt5@Rapa NPs containing Alexa Fluor
647 conjugated BSA diluted in fresh FluoroBrite DMEM medium (Thermo
Fisher Scientific). After 30 min, the cells were imaged with Leica
TCS SP8 confocal microscope using a 63× oil immersion objective.
Pt5@Rapa NPs were imaged using a 647 nm excitation wavelength. For
lysosomes imaging, the cells were incubated with 75 nM LysoTracker
Green DND-26 (Molecular probes). After 10 min of incubation, the medium
was removed, cells were washed three times with PBS, and imaged using
a 488 nm excitation wavelength for LysoTracker Green signal detection.

In Vitro Angiogenesis Assay
Seventy-two hours after
transfection with negative control siRNA or 4× predesigned KRIT1
siRNA, the HUVECs were incubated with 50 μg/mL Pt5, Pt5@Rapa
NPs, or 500 nM rapamycin. After 15 h, the In Vitro Angiogenesis Assay
(Millipore) was performed following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Briefly, untreated or treated HUVECs (10 × 103) were
plated in each well of a 96-well plate precoated with 50 μL
of ECMatrix (Millipore) in complete Medium 200. After 4 h of incubation,
the samples were stained with Calcein AM (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
for 20 min at 37 °C and the formation of capillary-like structures
was analyzed under an EVOS Cell Imaging microscope (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) at 4× magnification. To evaluate the degree of angiogenesis
progression, the number of closed polygons formed in eight replicates
was counted using ImageJ software (NIH).

Statistical Analysis
The data are expressed as mean
± SD. For statistical analysis, GraphPad Prism 5 statistical
analysis software was used (GraphPad Prism version 5.00 for Windows,
GraphPad Prism 5 Software, San Diego, California). The p-values were calculated using one-way analysis of variance and compared
to the corresponding control by the Bonferroni post-test. Each experiment
was independently performed at least three times. Differences between
treated samples and controls were considered statistically significant
for p-values < 0.05. (*p <
0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p <
0.001).
