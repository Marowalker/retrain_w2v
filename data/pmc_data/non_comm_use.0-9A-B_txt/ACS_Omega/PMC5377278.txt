Metabolic
activation of the carcinogenic tobacco-specific nitrosamines
4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK, 1) and N′-nitrosonornicotine (NNN, 2) results in the formation of 4-(3-pyridyl)-4-oxobutyl (POB)-DNA
adducts, several of which have been previously identified both in
vitro and in tissues of laboratory animals treated with NNK or NNN.
However, 2′-deoxycytidine adducts formed in this process have
been incompletely examined in previous studies. Therefore, in this
study we prepared characterized standards for the identification of
previously unknown 2′-deoxycytidine and 2′-deoxyuridine
adducts that could be produced in these reactions. The formation of
these products in reactions of 4-(acetoxymethylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone
(NNKOAc, 3), a model 4-(3-pyridyl)-4-oxobutylating agent,
with DNA was investigated. The major 2′-deoxycytidine adduct,
identified as its stable cytosine analogue O2-[4-(3-pyridyl)-4-oxobut-1-yl]-cytosine (12),
was O2-[4-(3-pyridyl)-4-oxobut-1-yl]-2′-deoxycytidine
(13), whereas lesser amounts of 3-[4-(3-pyridyl)-4-oxobut-1-yl]-2′-deoxycytidine
(14) and N4-[4-(3-pyridyl)-4-oxobut-1-yl]-2′-deoxycytidine
(15) were also observed. The potential conversion of
relatively unstable 2′-deoxycytidine adducts to stable 2′-deoxyuridine
adducts by treatment of the adducted DNA with bisulfite was also investigated,
but the harsh conditions associated with this approach prevented quantitation.
The results of this study provide new validated standards for the
study of 4-(3-pyridyl)-4-oxobutylation of DNA, a critical reaction
in the carcinogenesis by 1 and 2, and demonstrate
the presence of previously unidentified 2′-deoxycytidine adducts
in this DNA.

Introduction
The tobacco-specific nitrosamines 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone
(NNK, 1, Scheme 1) and N′-nitrosonornicotine (NNN, 2) are among the most important carcinogenic compounds in
tobacco products.1 Both are powerful cancer-causing
agents in animal models, NNK targeting mainly the lung in rats, mice,
hamsters, and ferrets, whereas NNN causing tumors of the oral cavity
and esophagus in rats and respiratory tract tumors in mice, hamsters,
and mink.2 NNK and NNN are considered “carcinogenic
to humans” by the International Agency for Research on Cancer.1 NNK and NNN are typical nitrosamine carcinogens,
requiring metabolic activation, generally by cytochrome P450 enzymes,
to exert their carcinogenic properties.2 Methyl hydroxylation of NNK and 2′-hydroxylation of NNN are
catalyzed by cytochrome P450s, such as human P450s 2A6, 2A13, and
others (Scheme 1).3,4 (There are also other hydroxylation reactions that are not shown
here.)2 The resulting α-hydroxynitrosamines, 4 and 5, are unstable, with lifetimes in the
range of seconds, spontaneously decomposing to diazohydroxide 6, which reacts with DNA, producing 4-(3-pyridyl)-4-oxobutyl
(POB)-DNA adducts (7).5 These
adducts can be hydrolyzed with acid to release 4-hydroxy-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone
(HPB, 8), which has been used to quantify 4-(3-pyridyl)-4-oxobutylation
of DNA as well as is an indicator of human exposure to tobacco-specific
compounds.6,7

Scheme 1 Metabolic Activation of NNK and NNN by P450s
and Hydrolysis of NNKOAc
by Esterase Yield Reactive Intermediates That Form POB-DNA Adducts
POB-DNA adducts can release HPB
upon acid hydrolysis.

Previous studies have
characterized and quantified POB-DNA adducts
in DNA reacted with the model compound 4-(acetoxymethylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone
(NNKOAc) (3, Scheme 1).8−10 NNKOAc hydrolysis can be catalyzed by esterase to
produce intermediate 4, leading to the identified DNA
adducts O2-POB-dThd (9), O6-POB-dGuo (10), 7-POB-Gua (11), and O2-POB-Cyt (12) (Chart 1), as well
as POB-phosphate adducts.11 The same adducts
have been detected in the tissues of rats treated with NNK or NNN.12−18 Adduct 12 is produced by neutral thermal hydrolysis
(NTH) of its relatively unstable precursor O2-POB-dCyd (13) and is a relatively minor product
among these four commonly analyzed DNA adducts; in fact, it was not
always observed, possibly due to the instability of 13.17 These studies also indicated by measurement
of released HPB (8) that the identified DNA adducts in
rats treated with NNK comprised approximately 45–95% of the
total POB-DNA adducts.

Chart 1 Structures of DNA Adducts Discussed in the
Text
Therefore, one objective of
our research has been to characterize
more completely DNA adduct formation from NNK and NNN. In the study
reported here, we focused on dCyd adducts. We hypothesized that there
may be additional POB-dCyd adducts formed from NNK or NNN but that
have not been previously detected due to lack of appropriate standards
and/or inherent instability. Thus, the 3-position and exocyclic N4-amino group of dCyd are also potentially reactive
sites for 4-(3-pyridyl)-4-oxobutylation, which could result in adducts
such as 14 and 15. Additionally, 3-substituted
dCyd adducts can undergo facile hydrolysis of the N4-imino group to produce deoxyuridine (dUrd) adducts (e.g., 16).19−22 Furthermore, we hypothesized that treatment of the adducted DNA
with bisulfite could convert the relatively unstable O2-POB-dCyd adduct, 13, to a stable dUrd adduct, 17, as O2-POB-dThd (9), a close structural analogue of 17, is stable. While
the bisulfite treatment approach proved to be untenable due to its
relatively harsh conditions, the newly synthesized dUrd standards, 16 and 17, were useful in our analysis. Thus,
in this study, we focused on the POB-dCyd and -dUrd adducts and report
an improved synthesis of adduct 12, the preparation of
standards for the identification of dCyd adducts 14 and 15 and dUrd adducts 16 and 17, and
analysis of these adducts in DNA reacted with NNKOAc (3).

Results
Starting with commercially available 4-amino-2-chloropyrimidine
(18), an efficient synthesis of O2-POB-Cyt (12) was achieved through a reaction
with HPB (8), in 44% yield, much higher than that previously
reported (Scheme 2).10

Scheme 2 Synthesis of O2-POB-Cyt (12)
Syntheses of adducts 14–17 were
based on the literature procedures for related compounds.23 Some general procedures are worth noting. All
2′-deoxyribonucleoside intermediates were prepared with the
2′-deoxyribose hydroxyl groups protected as t-butyldimethylsilyl (TBS) derivatives to direct reactivity toward
the O2, 3, or N4 position of the base. In an
effort to make these reactions as selective as possible, a dithiane-protected
HPB intermediate, 26 (Scheme 5), or the tosylated version, 22 (Scheme 3), was used
under basic alkylation conditions in the syntheses. Despite these
efforts to increase the yields, the maximum yields of the purified
adducts did not exceed about 2%. Deprotection of the TBS intermediates
was achieved through a mixture of tetrahydrofuran (THF) and aqueous
trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). In the synthesis of 3-POB-dCyd (14) (Scheme 3), the Boc group was removed under the same conditions but with a
higher concentration of TFA. The dithiane was removed with a mixture
of N-chlorosuccinimide (NCS) and AgNO3.

Scheme 3 Preparation of 3-POB-dCyd (14)
TBSCl, t-butyldimethylsilyl
chloride; DMAP, 4-dimethylaminopyridine.

The
synthesis of 3-POB-dCyd (14) is summarized in Scheme 3. This product could
only be confirmed by mass spectrometry because it was unstable to
HPLC collection, deaminating to 3-POB-dUrd (16) on the
column. Therefore, our studies with this adduct were performed using
a crude mixture resulting from the final deprotection of 23. However, the protected precursor, 23, was fully characterized,
confirming its structure and connectivity. Because the structural
similarities between the 3- and N4-POB-dCyd
adducts make it difficult to discern the two, two-dimensional (2D)
NMR was utilized to determine multiple-bond connectivities. For compound 23, the fully protected precursor to 3-POB-dCyd (14), the first methylene of the pyridyloxobutyl side chain showed equal
interactions with C2 and C4 of the pyrimidine ring. In contrast, a
2D-HMBC of N4-POB-dCyd (15) confirmed that alkylation occurred at the N4 position;
a strong signal was observed between the first methylene group of
the pyridyloxobutyl chain and C4 and C5 of the pyrimidine ring.

The synthesis of N4-POB-dCyd (15) is summarized in Scheme 4. The protected dCyd, 20, was reacted
with the HPB derivative, 22, to yield 24, which was deprotected to give N4-POB-dCyd
(15).

Scheme 4 Preparation of N4-POB-dCyd
(15)
NCS, N-chlorosuccinimide.

The synthesis of O2-POB-dUrd (17) (Scheme 5) utilized cyclic
precursor 25, activating the O2 position to
alkylation with protected
alcohol 26 under basic conditions. When compared to the 13C shifts of 3-POB-dUrd (16), it was clear that 17 had an O-connectivity, as the carbon of the pyridyloxobutyl
chain attached to the 2-oxygen atom of the dUrd ring was far downfield
at 68 ppm compared with the N-connectivity of 16 at 40.2
ppm.

Scheme 5 Preparation of O2-POB-dUrd (17)
NCS, N-chlorosuccinimide.

The preparation of 3-POB-dUrd (16) (Scheme 6) followed
the same basic strategy
used for 3-POB-dCyd (14), except that 16 was stable and readily isolable, in contrast to 14.

Scheme 6 Preparation of 3-POB-dUrd (16)
TBSCl, t-butyldimethylsilyl
chloride; TBAF, tetrabutylammonium fluoride.

Compounds 12 and 14–17 were subjected to acid, base, and neutral thermal stability tests. O2-POB-Cyt (12) was unstable to
basic conditions; 3-POB-dCyd (14) partially degraded
when heated or subjected to HPLC analysis; and O2-POB-dUrd (17) was unstable to pH extremes. Otherwise,
these compounds were reasonably stable under acidic, basic, and NTH
conditions.

O2-POB-Cyt (12) was the
major dCyd-related adduct observed in the reaction of calf thymus
DNA with NNKOAc (3) (Table 1 and Figure 1). The levels of 3-POB-dCyd (14) and N4-POB-dCyd (15) were lower. When
the reaction mixture was subjected to NTH at 100 °C for 1 h,
the amount of 12 increased, consistent with previous
results.10,12 After NTH, 3-POB-dCyd (14)
was no longer detected but N4-POB-dCyd
(15) was still observed. No POB-dUrd adducts were detected.

With respect to
the proposed bisulfite treatment of DNA, O2-POB-Cyt (12) was not stable to
the basic DNA denaturation conditions and 3-POB-dCyd (14) converted to 3-POB-dUrd (16). The results of the experiment
in which DNA was denatured with base and then treated with bisulfite
are illustrated in Figure 2. 3-POB-dUrd (16) was detected, and 4-POB-dCyd
(15) was also observed, but there was no evidence for O2-POB-dUrd (17). Quantitation was
not feasible due to extensive degradation of the internal standard,
[pyridine-D4]O2-POB-dThd, under
the reaction conditions.

Discussion
The results of this study provide a more complete
picture of dCyd
adduct formation in the reaction of NNKOAc with DNA. Our results indicate
that O2-POB-dCyd (13), isolated
and analyzed as O2-POB-Cyt (12), is the major dCyd adduct formed in these reactions. Considerably
lower amounts of 3-POB-dCyd (14) and N4-POB-dCyd (15) were observed, and we were
unable to provide conclusive evidence for substantial amounts of dUrd
adduct formation in these reactions. In previous studies of cytidine
alkylation, reactivity at the O2-position
versus the 3- or N4-position was dependent
on the alkylating agent;24 thus, the predominance
of O2-POB-dCyd (13) may result
mainly from the properties of the POB intermediate, 6. Overall, these results do not indicate that dCyd adduct formation
is a quantitatively significant pathway of DNA 4-(3-pyridyl)-4-oxobutylation
compared with the previously established reactions, which produce
the major products observed in vitro and in vivo, such as 7-POB-Gua
(11) and O2-POB-dThd (9).

Although our results do not contribute significantly
to the identification
of any major and previously unknown DNA adduct formed in 4-(3-pyridyl)-4-oxobutylation
reactions using NNKOAc, we were able to achieve and/or improve the
preparation of five relevant DNA adducts: O2-POB-Cyt (12), 3-POB-dCyd (14), N4-POB-dCyd (15), O2-POB-dUrd (17), and 3-POB-dUrd (16), four of which are novel. O2-POB-Cyt
(12) has been previously synthesized by NTH of O2-POB-dCyd (13), which results
from the alkylation of dCyd with NNKOAc (3) in very low
yields.10 Here, by utilizing commercially
available 4-amino-2-chloropyrimidine (18) and reacting
it with HPB (8), a 44% yield was achieved in a one-step
synthesis. The synthesis of 3-POB-dCyd (14) posed a stability
problem. The deprotected adduct, 14, readily deaminated
to 3-POB-dUrd (16) during the HPLC purification process,
partially confirming our hypothesis that the POB-dUrd adducts were
more stable and therefore potentially more easily detected than the
POB-dCyd adducts. O2-POB-dUrd (17) was synthesized in a selective manner using a cyclic dUrd precursor, 25, and reacting with the protected dithiane, 26 (Scheme 5), to yield
the O2 adduct exclusively. These new standards will be
useful in future investigations of DNA adduct formation in laboratory
animals and humans exposed to NNK and NNN.

The bisulfite treatment
approach initially appeared attractive
for the conversion of potentially unstable O2-POB-dCyd adducts (13) to stable O2-POB-dUrd adducts (17), particularly in
view of the established stability of O2-POB-dThd (9), a major DNA adduct of NNK and NNN in
the tissues of rats treated with these carcinogens. Bisulfite sequencing
is a well-studied reaction that is utilized extensively in the methylation
analysis of dCyd. Bisulfite treatment only deaminates unmethylated
dCyd, converting it into dUrd. This modified DNA is then subjected
to PCR, where methylated dCyd is amplified as dCyd but dUrd is amplified
as dThd. This allows one to determine the location of methylated dCyd
in a strand of DNA. This is a very efficient reaction that takes very
little DNA, as low as nanogram amounts, but bisulfite conditions are
also very harsh and can degrade as much as 95% of a DNA sample.25,26 We were unable to identify bisulfite treatment conditions that did
not degrade DNA or our internal standard during the proposed conversion
of O2-POB-dCyd (13) to O2-POB-dUrd (17) and thus had to
abandon this approach, although we did observe 3-POB-dUrd (16) in these reactions (Figure 2).

In summary, we report a more complete analysis of
adduct formation
with dCyd during 4-(3-pyridyl)-4-oxobutylation of DNA by intermediates
formed in the metabolic activation of the tobacco-specific carcinogens
NNK and NNN. Using newly prepared synthetic standards encompassing
potential reactions with dCyd and possible conversion of these to
dUrd adducts, we demonstrate that 3-POB-dCyd (14) and N4-POB-dCyd (15) are relatively
minor products of these reactions compared with the previously identified O2-POB-Cyt (12), a thermal hydrolysis
product of O2-POB-dCyd (13).

Experimental Procedures
Chemicals and Reagents
HPB (8),27 NNKOAc (3),28 2′-deoxy-3′,5′-bis-O-(t-butyldimethylsilyl)cytidine (20),29 3-[2-(3-pyridyl)-1,3-dithian-2-yl]propan-1-ol
(26),30,31 and 2′-deoxy-3′,5′-bis-O-[t-butyldimethylsilyl]-uridine (29)32 were synthesized as reported
previously. Phosphodiesterase II, micrococcal nuclease, and calf thymus
DNA were purchased from Worthington. Unless otherwise noted, all other
chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Accurate masses were
obtained on an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid instrument (Thermo Scientific).
UV spectra were recorded for a 15 mM NH4OAc/MeCN mixture
on an Agilent 1100 Series LC-UV. NMR studies were performed on a 500
MHz Bruker spectrometer equipped with a Bruker Avance IIIHD console
using a 5 mm probe or a 700 MHz Bruker UltraShield using a 1.7 mm
CryoProbe. Submilligram yields were calculated by quantitative NMR.33

General Methods
Removal of the Dithiane
Protecting Group
This was adapted
from a published procedure.23 The reactants
were dissolved in MeCN (65 mM) and stirred at room temperature. Separately, N-chlorosuccinimide (NCS, 1 equiv) and AgNO3 (1
equiv) were weighed and dissolved in 4:1 MeCN/H2O (200
mM), which was added to the reaction mixture. This was stirred at
room temperature for 30 min, followed by the addition of 0.1 mL each
of saturated NaCl, Na2SO3, and Na2CO3, and the mixture was allowed to stir at room temperature
for an additional 20 min. MeCN was removed in vacuo, and the remaining
aqueous solution was filtered through a preconditioned (washed with
1 mL MeOH, followed by 2 × 1 mL distilled H2O washes)
30 mg Strata-X 33 μm cartridge (Phenomenex) and washed twice
with 1 mL H2O, and the analytes were eluted in 1.5 mL MeOH.

Removal of TBS and Boc Protecting Groups
For TBS removal,
the reactants were dissolved in 2:1:1 THF/TFA/H2O (100
mM) for 60 min at room temperature. For removal of Boc, a mixture
of 8:20:1 THF/TFA/H2O was used. Saturated NaHCO3 (5 volume equiv) was added and stirred for an additional 20 min.
THF was removed in vacuo, and the remaining aqueous layer was loaded
on a preconditioned (washed with 6 mL MeOH, followed by 2 × 6
mL H2O washes) 200 mg Strata-X 33 μm cartridge (Phenomenex)
and washed twice with 6 mL H2O, and the analytes were eluted
in 6 mL MeOH.

Purification of Analytical Standards
Purification was
carried out using a Luna 5 μm C18, 100 Å, 250 × 10
mm2 preparatory column (Phenomenex) with a linear gradient
and a 3 mL/min flow rate. The initial composition of the eluents was
85% A, and it decreased to 76.5% A over 12 min, where A was H2O and B was MeCN. Analytes were collected between 9 and 11
min, concentrated, and reinjected onto a Luna 5 μm C18, 100
Å, 250 × 4.6 mm2 analytical column (Phenomenex).
A linear gradient and a 1 mL/min flow rate were used, with an initial
composition of 95% A, which was decreased to 50% A over 40 min.

O2-[4-(3-Pyridyl)-4-oxobut-1-yl]cytosine
(O2-POB-Cyt, 12)
In a 5 mL round-bottom flask, HPB (2, 105.8 mg, 0.51
mmol) was dissolved in 1.0 mL of THF. NaH (60% immersion in oil, 20.8
mg, 0.52 mmol) was slowly added. The reactants were stirred at room
temperature for 20 min. 4-Amino-2-chloropyrimidine (18, 25.1 mg, 0.19 mmol) was dissolved in 0.5 mL of THF and slowly added
to the flask. The flask was fitted with a jacketed condenser, and
the mixture was heated under reflux at 70 °C overnight. The reaction
mixture was then dissolved in 2 mL H2O and extracted three
times with CHCl3, and the CHCl3 extracts were
dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated
to dryness. A Florisil plug was eluted with EtOAc to remove unreacted
HPB; then, the product was purified by HPLC as described, with a yield
of 21.6 mg (0.084 mmol, 44%). The spectral data matched those reported
previously.10

3-[4-(3-Pyridyl)-4-oxobut-1-yl]-2′-deoxycytidine
(3-POB-dCyd, 14)
Compound 23 was
deprotected using
the procedures outlined above. These reactions were monitored by HPLC–MS/MS.
Purification was attempted by HPLC; however, the major product isolated
was the deaminated 3-POB-dU analogue, 16, and could not
be fully characterized by NMR. HRMS calcd for C18H22N4O5•H+, 375.1663; found, 375.1672. UV: 229, 268.

N4-[4-(3-Pyridyl)-4-oxobut-1-yl]-2′-deoxycytidine
(N4-POB-dCyd, 15)
3′,5′-bis-O-t-Butyldimethylsilyl-2′-deoxycytidine29 (14.1 mg, 0.030 mmol) was dissolved in 0.1 mL
dimethylformamide (DMF). NaH was added (60% in oil, 3.3 mg, 0.08 mmol),
and the reaction mixture was kept at room temperature for 20 min.
A solution of 3-[2-(pyridin-3-yl)-1,3-dithian-2-yl]propyl 4-methylbenzenesulfonate
(22) (10.5 mg, 0.026 mmol) in 0.14 mL of DMF was added.
The reaction mixture was capped, sealed with parafilm, and stirred
overnight at 37 °C. DMF was removed in vacuo, and the residue
was taken up in H2O and extracted three times with CH2Cl2. The combined organic layers were washed with
brine, dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated
in vacuo. This crude product was then desilylated using the general
protocol outlined above. The products were concentrated in vacuo,
and the dithiane was removed using the general protocol to give crude 15, which was purified as described in the general methods.

O2-[4-(3-Pyridyl)-4-oxobut-1-yl]-2′-deoxyuridine
(O2-POB-dUrd, 17)
This procedure was adapted from the preparation of the thymidine
analogue.23 A solution of 3-[2-(3-pyridyl)-1,3-dithian-2-yl]propan-1-ol
(26) in DMF (48.2 mg, 0.16 mmol, 30 mM) was flushed with
N2. To it, 20.5 mg of NaH (60% in oil, 0.51 mmol) was added,
and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 min.
Then, 2,5′-anhydro-2′-deoxyuridine (25,
20.8 mg, 0.10 mmol) was added, the reaction mixture was flushed again
with N2, capped, sealed with parafilm, and stirred at 37
°C for 72 h. DMF was then removed under vacuum, and excess starting
materials were removed by passage through a silica plug eluted with
4:1 CHCl3/MeOH. This mixture was then treated using the
general protocol for removal of the dithiane group, and the product
was purified by HPLC as in the general methods, 224 μg, 0.60

Analytical Standards’
Stability
Solutions of
the analytical standards were treated with base, acid, and heat to
gauge stability. Standards of 12 and 14–17 (50 fmol/μL) were treated with HCl and NaOH separately
at a final concentration of 0.1 M. These solutions were incubated
at room temperature for 1 h before neutralizing to pH 7. Separate
aliquots were incubated for 1 h at 100 °C to determine the thermal
stability.

Reaction of NNKOAc with DNA
This
was carried out essentially
as described previously.10 Briefly, calf
thymus DNA (5.5 mg) was dissolved in 2.5 mL of 0.1 M phosphate buffer,
pH 7.0. To this, porcine liver esterase (3.8 mg, 70 U) and NNKOAc
(9.2 mg, 35 μmol in 25 μL of methanol) were added, and
the reaction was gently agitated at 37 °C for 2 h. The mixture
was diluted with 3 mL of H2O and washed twice with 6 mL
of CHCl3/isoamyl alcohol (24:1), followed by 6 mL of ethyl
acetate. The DNA was precipitated from the aqueous portion by the
addition of ethanol, washed with 70% of aqueous ethanol followed by
ethanol, and then briefly dried in a stream of N2. A small
aliquot was set aside for analysis of the nucleotide content, and
the rest was carried forward.

Base Denaturation of Pyridyloxobutylated
DNA
Prior
to reaction with bisulfite, DNA must be denatured. Aliquots of DNA
that had been reacted with NNKOAc (0.9 mg each) and analytical standards 15 (small aliquot), 12, and 16 (30
pmol each, including 2 pmol internal standard [pyridine-D4]O2-POB-dThd) were dissolved in 0.5 mL
of distilled H2O, and 5 μL of 10 N NaOH was added
to achieve a final concentration of 0.1 N NaOH; the solution was kept
at 37 °C for 20 min. A small sample (which included 1 pmol internal
standard [pyridine-D4]O2-POB-dThd)
was neutralized by the addition of 5 N HCl and set aside for analysis.
To the remaining reactions, 1.0 mL of distilled H2O was
added and taken immediately forward.

Reactions of Pyridyloxobutylated
DNA with Bisulfite
A saturated solution of bisulfite was
prepared by adding 6 g of Na2S2O5 to a solution of aqueous 100 mM
hydroquinone and 0.4 M NaOH for a total volume of 10.0 mL. Saturated
bisulfite solution (1 mL) was added to each DNA aliquot, analytical
standard, and one H2O blank (for a total volume of 2.5
mL), and the reaction mixture was stirred at 50 °C overnight,
shielded from light. DNA reactions were then desalted on prepacked
PD-10 Desalting Columns (GE Healthcare) and eluted into 3.5 mL of
distilled H2O. Analytical standards were desalted on a
200 mg Strata-X cartridge using a scaled-up version of the procedure
described earlier (4 mL per wash), and analytes were eluted in 4 mL
of MeOH. MeOH eluates were evaporated in vacuo, and the reaction mixtures
were redissolved in 0.5 mL of distilled H2O. For desulfonation,
53 μL of 10 N NaOH was added to the DNA reaction mixtures and
9 μL was added to the analytical standards, and the reaction
mixtures were gently agitated at 37 °C for 20 min. The reaction
mixtures were then neutralized by the addition of 5 N HCl, and DNA
was precipitated from ethanol and then washed with 70% aqueous ethanol
followed by ethanol and then briefly dried in a stream of N2. Analytical standards were purified on 30 mg Strata-X cartridges,
as described above. MeOH eluates were concentrated in vacuo and reconstituted
in 30 μL of 2% MeCN in 15 mM NH4OAc for analysis.

Enzymatic DNA Hydrolysis
This was performed essentially
as described.35 Briefly, 1 mg of treated
DNA aliquots was dissolved in 1.0 mL of 5 mM CaCl2, 10
mM succinic acid buffer, pH 6.5. Internal standard [pyridine-D4]O2-POB-dThd (1 pmol), phosphodiesterase
II (250 mU), and micrococcal nuclease (30 U) were added, and the mixture
was gently agitated at 37 °C for at least 5 h. Alkaline phosphatase
(75 U) was then added, and agitation was continued at 37 °C overnight.
The samples were then loaded onto Centrifree 30 kDa MWCO centrifugal
filters (Millipore) and centrifuged at 4 °C for 20 min at 4000
rpm. A 10 μL aliquot of each filtrate was removed for dGuo analysis
and quantitation by HPLC, and the remaining filtrate was purified
by solid-phase extraction on a Strata-x 33 μm polymeric reversed-phase
cartridge (30 mg; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). The cartridge was preconditioned
with one 1.0 mL MeOH wash, followed by two 1.0 mL H2O washes.
The reaction mixtures were loaded and washed with 1 mL of H2O and 1 mL of 10% (v/v) MeOH sequentially, and the analytes were
eluted into 1.0 mL of MeOH. The MeOH eluates were then concentrated
in vacuo and reconstituted in 30 μL of 2% MeCN in 15 mM NH4OAc. Adduct formation was normalized to the dGuo content of
each sample.35 Quantitation of dGuo was
performed on an Agilent 1100 series HPLC, with a UV diode array detector
set at 254 nm. LC was performed on a 0.5 × 250 mm2 Luna C18(2) 5 μm, 100 Å column (Phenomenex), with a linear
gradient at 10 μL/min from 5 to 20% MeOH in H2O over
22 min, with subsequent washout and re-equilibration.

DNA Adduct
Analysis by LC–MS/MS
The DNA hydrolysates
and analytical standard reactions were analyzed for standards 12, 14–17, and internal standard
[pyridine-D4]O2-POB-dThd by
liquid chromatography–positive electrospray ionization–tandem
mass spectrometry (LC–ESI+-MS/MS). LC was carried
out on a 0.5 × 150 mm2 Zorbax SB-C18 5 μm column
(Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) with a gradient and a flow rate of 15 μL/min.
After maintaining the initial conditions at 2% B for 3 min, the composition
was increased to 39.1% B from 3 to 20 min, followed by washout and
re-equilibration, where solvent A was 15 mM NH4OAc and
solvent B was MeCN. MS was performed on a TSQ Quantum Discovery MAX
triple quadrupole mass analyzer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA).
Selected reaction monitoring mass transitions were m/z 375.1 → 259.1, 375.1 → 148.1, and
259.1 → 148.1 for dC-POB adducts. Transitions monitored for
dU-POB adducts were m/z 376.1 →
260.1, 376.1 → 148.1, and 260.1 → 148.1. For internal
standard [pyridine-D4]O2-POB-dThd,
the transition m/z 394.1 →
152.1 was monitored, as well as m/z 390.1 → 148.1, corresponding to the nondeuterated O2-POB-dThd (9). The collision energy
was 23 eV and scan width was 0.4 amu. Calibration curves that covered
the range observed in the in vitro DNA samples for 12, 15, and 16 were used for quantitation.
As we were unable to purify 3-POB-dCyd (14) fully, the
calibration curve for N4-POB-dCyd (15) was applied to quantify the formation of 14 in vitro, making the assumption that the LC–MS/MS response
for 14 was similar to that for 15. The calibration
curves for all adducts were linear (R2 > 0.998) between 2.5 and 250 fmol on the column, which covered
the
range observed in the samples. The limit of detection was found to
be 1.0 fmol on the column.
