Dissolved Se(VI)
removal by three commercially available zero-valent
irons (ZVIs) was examined in oxic batch experiments under circumneutral
pH conditions in the presence and absence of NO3– and SO42–. Environmentally relevant
Se(VI) (1 mg L–1), NO3– ([NO3—N] = 15 mg L–1), and SO42– (1800 mg L–1) were
employed to simulate mining-impacted waters. Ninety percent of Se(VI)
removal was achieved within 4–8 h in the absence of SO42– and NO3–. A similar Se(VI) removal rate was observed after 10–32 h
in the presence of NO3–. Dissolved Se(VI)
removal rates exhibited the highest decrease in the presence of SO42–; 90% of Se(VI) removal was measured after
50–191 h for SO42– and after 150–194
h for SO42– plus NO3– depending on the ZVI tested. Despite differences in removal rates
among batches and ZVI materials, Se(VI) removal consistently followed
first-order reaction kinetics. Scanning electron microscopy, Raman
spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction analyses of reacted solids showed
that Fe(0) present in ZVI undergoes oxidation to magnetite [Fe3O4], wüstite [FeO], lepidocrocite [γ-FeOOH],
and goethite [α-FeOOH] over time. X-ray absorption near-edge
structure spectroscopy indicated that Se(VI) was reduced to Se(IV)
and Se(0) during removal. These results demonstrate that ZVI can be
effectively used to control Se(VI) concentrations in mining-impacted
waters.

Introduction
Selenium contamination
by anthropogenic activities, including mining,
is an increasing environmental issue worldwide.1−4 Although total dissolved Se rarely
exceeds 10 μg L–1 in natural waters,5 concentrations exceeding 100 μg L–1 are reported for mining-impacted waters.4,6 Excessive
Se exposure can have negative impacts on aquatic ecosystems.7 Consequently, the World Health Organization established
a 40 μg L–1 Se drinking water standard.8 The corresponding Health Canada and United States
Environmental Protection Agency standards are 50 μg L–1.9,10 Water quality criteria for protection of aquatic
life for Se are substantially lower at 1 μg L–1 in Canada11 and 5 μg L–1 in the United States.10

Selenium
contamination by mining and mineral processing is commonly
associated with coal operations;4,7,12 however, Se contamination by copper6 and
uranium2 mining is also documented. Selenium
substitution for sulfur (S) occurs in sulfide minerals, including
pyrite [FeS2], chalcopyrite [CuFeS2], and sphalerite
[ZnS].7,12−14 The oxidative weathering
of these sulfides within mine waste deposits can generate sulfate
(SO42–) and release metals (i.e., Fe,
Cu, and Zn) and trace elements, including Se.15,16 Nitrate (NO3–) derived from residual
blasting agents can also co-occur with SO42–, metals, and trace elements in mining-impacted waters.17−19 Consequently, Se-bearing waters associated with mining and mineral
processing can contain elevated concentrations of Se, SO4, and NO3.

Selenium can occur in four oxidation
states (i.e., VI, IV, 0, and
−II) in the environment; however, Se(VI) and Se(IV) predominate
in natural and contaminated waters.5,7,20 Se(VI) oxyanions HSeO3– and SeO32– exhibit sorption onto Fe(III)
(hydr)oxides and other variably charged mineral surfaces at circumneutral
to acidic pH.21 However, SeO42–, the dominant Se(VI) oxyanion at pH > 2,
exhibits
a relatively weak sorption onto mineral surfaces over a wide pH range.22 Consequently, Se(IV) is generally less mobile
and bioavailable than Se(VI) in the environment. Abiotic or biological
reduction of Se(VI) or Se(IV) to insoluble Se(0) can also decrease
Se mobility and bioavailability.5

Selenium sorption onto Fe(III) (hydr)oxides, including ferrihydrite
[Fe2O3·9H2O], goethite [α-FeOOH],
and hematite [Fe2O3], has been widely studied.23−31 More recently, removal by zero-valent iron (ZVI) has been examined
as a method for treating Se-contaminated waters.32−37 These studies examined Se(VI) or Se(IV) removal under both oxic32,34,35,37 and anoxic36,38,39 conditions. Previous studies (both oxic and anoxic) generally agree
that Se(VI) removal follows three principal steps: (1) Se(VI) reduction
to Se(IV) by dissolved or adsorbed Fe(II); (2) Se(IV) sorption onto
Fe(III) (hydr)oxides at ZVI surfaces; and (3) subsequent reduction
of Se(IV) to Se(0) or Se(−II) on the ZVI surface.35−37,40 Additional research examined
different approaches to enhance Se removal, including the introduction
of organic matter,36 transition metals,38,39 clay minerals,41,42 and magnetic fields.43,44 Unfortunately, the Se(VI) concentrations used in previous studies
were often considerably higher and did not reflect those typically
observed in mine-impacted waters.34,36 Further, the
dominant aqueous concentrations in the tests conducted to determine
the influence of ZVI on Se(VI) removal have not represented the chemistry
of mine waters.4,7,12 Mine
waters generally contain elevated SO42– concentrations derived from sulfide-mineral oxidation15,16 and elevated NO3– concentrations derived
from blasting agents commonly used during mining.17−19 Although these
ions have the potential to influence Se(VI) removal by ZVI,32 their influence on Se(VI) removal rates and
mechanisms by ZVI has not been reported. This study examined the influence
of SO42– and NO3– on Se(VI) removal rates and mechanisms by three ZVI materials using
environmentally relevant concentrations of SO42–, NO3–, and Se(VI). Results of this
study will inform the development of Se(VI) removal methods for waters
impacted by mining and other anthropogenic activities.

Results and Discussion
Initial
ZVI Characteristics
The three unreacted ZVI
samples exhibited particle morphologies ranging from angular to subrounded
(Figure 1). Reacted
ZVI particle morphologies are presented in Figure S1. Surface areas were generally low; however, CGPM exhibited
a slightly higher surface area (2.5 m2 g–1) than both PM and QMP (2.3 m2 g–1).
The minor differences between surface areas of all of the ZVI samples
could be attributed to granularity or the presence of oxidation products.
These values are in general agreement with previously reported ZVI
surface areas of 1.63 m2 g–1 for PM32 and 0.36 m2 g–1.35

Figure 1 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images
of unreacted ZVI: (a)
CGPM, (b) PM, and (c) QMP. Scale bars are 20 μm.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) revealed that all three
ZVI materials composed
of Fe(0) with magnetite [Fe3O4] and minor wüstite
[FeO] (Figure S2a). Raman spectra exhibited
a strong band for magnetite at ∼670 cm–1 (Figure S3a). Two strong bands at ∼1315
and ∼1585 cm–1 in all of the three ZVI materials
were attributed to the presence of carbon. Overall, the XRD and Raman
analyses indicate that ZVI mineralogy was consistent with previous
studies.34,35,46,47

Se(VI) Removal Rates
The Se(VI)
removal was effectively
described by first-order reaction kinetics (R2 = 0.98–0.99), with an additional term (r) included to represent the residual aqueous Se(VI) concentrations
(Figure 2, Table 1). Removal of >90%
Se(VI) was achieved in 4 h (PM) to 8 h (QMP) in the absence of SO42– and NO3– (Figure 2a). The
removal rates decreased approximately 10 times in the presence of
SO42– (1800 mg L–1),
with 90% Se(VI) removal observed in 50 h (CGPM) to 191 h (QMP) (Figure 2b, Table 1). In contrast, Se(VI) removal
rates were decreased 1.5–2.5 times in the presence of NO3– ([NO3—N]0 = 15 mg L–1), with 90% Se(VI) removal observed
after 10 h (PM) to 32 h (QMP) (Figure 2c, Table 1). Se(VI) removal rates also decreased in the presence of SO42– + NO3– (Figure 2d, Table 1), with 90% removal observed
after 150 h (PM) to 194 h (CGPM) of reaction time. These rates were
similar to those observed for the batches (B2) containing only SO42– (Table 1). These results are generally consistent with previous
studies on the influence of SO42– on
Se removal by ZVI. Zhang et al.32 observed
that increasing the SO42– concentration
from 480 to 48 000 mg L–1 decreased the Se
removal rate by 65%, that is, from 0.093 to 0.033 h–1. Reinsch et al.48 reported that both
SO42– and NO3– may promote passivation of ZVI surfaces and therefore a decrease
in Se removal efficiency. The fits using first-order reactions were
consistent with other studies that used first-order or pseudo-first-order
reaction kinetics to describe oxic Se removal by ZVI.32,34,35,49 Although all of the three ZVI materials exhibited Se(VI) removal
capacity, Peerless Metal (PM) was the most effective under the experimental
conditions (Table 1). Results indicate that both CGPM and PM are considered to be the
more suitable ZVI compared with QMP with respect to the removal rate
of Se(VI) from the aqueous solutions tested in this study.

ZVI Corrosion
Concomitant pH increases and Eh decreases
were observed in all batches following ZVI addition (Figure 3). Initial Eh values for all
batches ranged from 550 to 575 mV but declined rapidly and stabilized
between 200 and 400 mV following ZVI addition. This trend is attributed
to the initial ZVI corrosion and subsequent solution equilibration
or surface passivation.46 Initial pH averaged
6.0 ± 0.2 among all batch experiments but rapidly increased to
between 7 and 10 following ZVI addition (Figure 3). The largest pH increases were observed
in batches containing both SO42– and
NO3– (B4), with pH values for all ZVI
materials exceeding 9.0 during the experiment.

Figure 3 Measured pH and Eh values
for B1, B2, B3, and B4 batches.

Although differences in pH between ZVI materials were observed,
the source of these differences was not apparent. Subtle differences
in the mineralogy of ZVI surface coatings could produce variation
in solution pH; however, final pH values for all batches were consistently
within 1 pH unit. The increase in pH with reaction time was attributed
to ZVI (Fe0) corrosion, which generates Fe(II), H2, and OH–50 1  Subsequent
Fe(OH)2(s) formation
at ZVI surfaces has previously been proposed;34,50,51 however, this metastable phase forms under
anoxic conditions and would rapidly oxidize to Fe(III) (hydr)oxide
in the presence of oxygen.46 Liu et al.46 proposed an additional ZVI corrosion pathway
in the presence of O2 2  Reactions 2 and 3 involve the formation
of Fe(II), which would undergo rapid oxidation followed by Fe(III)
(hydr)oxide precipitation under oxic conditions at circumneutral pH.46 Dissolved Fe concentrations were consistently
less than 0.02 mg L–1 (data not shown), suggesting
that the formation of secondary phases controlled the dissolved Fe
concentrations in all batches. These observations are generally consistent
with previous studies, which reported similar trends to the current
study in both Eh and pH during ZVI corrosion.34,36,46,52

Nitrate Reduction
In the absence of SO42– (B3), NO3—N concentrations linearly
decreased from 15 to 12 mg L–1 over 32 h (Figure 4a). Similar results
were observed for B4 batches, where NO3—N concentrations
linearly decreased over 34 h from 14 to 11 mg L–1 in the presence of SO42– (Figure 4b). These data suggest
that SO42– had a limited influence on
NO3– reduction by ZVI. Nitrate (NO3—N) concentrations further decreased in B4 to between
6 and 10 mg L–1 after 121 h. Subsequent decreases
were limited, and NO3—N concentrations after 194
h were 7.8 mg L–1 (CGPM), 6.4 mg L–1 (PM), and 8.4 mg L–1 (QMP). These results indicated
that ZVI can remove Se(VI) and NO3– simultaneously
over the pH range of the experiments. These findings are consistent
with those of other studies conducted over a wide pH range in the
presence and absence of competing ions.52−55

Figure 4 Nitrate (as N) and ammonium
(as N) concentrations with time for B3 and B4 batches.

Dissolved NH4+—N concentrations
increased
over the first 0.5–32 h in B3 and B4 batches (Figure 4). These increases were generally
proportional to decreases in NO3–—N
concentrations for individual ZVI materials for both batches. However,
subsequent decreases in NH4+—N concentrations
after 50–100 h were observed for B4 batches (Figure 4b).

Desorption measurements
suggested that these decreases resulted
from NH4+—N sorption onto ZVI surfaces
with time. More specifically, these measurements revealed that up
to 30% of NH4+ was adsorbed to reacted ZVI surfaces
during the experiments. These findings are consistent with previous
studies52−55 that have reported NH4+ formation during NO3– reduction by ZVI. 3  Nitrate reduction by ZVI
has been shown to
be a spontaneous process by either an indirect reduction of NO3– by hydrogen generated via Fe corrosion
(eq 2) or a direct reduction
via Fe0 (eq 3).52,54

Secondary Mineralogy
Overall, XRD
results show that
magnetite and lepidocrocite are the principal products of ZVI reaction
under oxic conditions. Distinct magnetite XRD peaks were observed
for all ZVI materials after 8 h in the absence of both SO42– and NO3– (B1).
The Fe(0) peaks did show an appreciable increase or decrease in intensity
after 8 h (end of the experiment) (Figure S2b). The intensity of the initial wüstite peaks diminished after
8 h, which suggests oxidation had occurred (Figure S2b). Magnetite peaks were observed after 191 h in the presence
of SO42– (B2). In addition to the magnetite
peaks, weak lepidocrocite and goethite peaks developed for ZVI from
B2 batches (Figure S2c). The intensity
of Fe(0) peaks in B2 diminished considerably compared to those in
B1, suggesting more intense oxidation and accompanying ZVI corrosion
due to extended reaction time. In contrast to Fe(0), magnetite peaks
increased in intensity for the solid samples collected from all B2
batches. This observation suggested that the solid phase from B2 was
dominated by magnetite plus minor lepidocrocite, traces of goethite,
and residual Fe(0) (Figure S2c). The mineralogies
of reacted B3 and B1 samples were generally consistent and composed
of Fe(0), magnetite, and wüstite (Figure S2d). Minor lepidocrocite peaks were observed in B3; however,
this phase was not detected in reacted B1 solids. These variations
may result from the differences in the reaction time (i.e., 8 h for
B1 and 32 h for B3) or the role of NO3– in ZVI oxidation (Figure S2d). The mineralogies
of reacted B4 and B2 ZVI materials were also similar (Figure S2e). For example, B4 and B2 samples were
dominated by magnetite and lepidocrocite, plus traces of goethite
and residual Fe(0). However, the intensities of the magnetite peaks
were lower and those of the lepidocrocite peaks were greater for B2
compared to those of the B4 samples. This observation suggests that
although B2 and B4 were reacted for similar time periods (191 h for
B2 and 194 h for B4), NO3– enhanced ZVI
oxidation in B4.

Raman spectral analyses also indicated that
magnetite and lepidocrocite were the principal products of ZVI oxidation
in all batches. However, Raman spectra exhibited three weak bands
at approximately 300, 485, and 548 cm–1 because
of the presence of goethite phases (Figure S3b–e). Bands for lepidocrocite at approximately 246 and 376 cm–1 were stronger for B3 and B4 compared to those for B1 and B2. This
observation further suggests that NO3– enhances ZVI oxidation (Figure S3d,e).
Magnetite bands were better defined for B1 samples (Figure S3b) compared to those for the other three batches
(Figure S3c–e), which suggested
that reaction time might have contributed to the observed variations
in secondary phases. The bands assigned to carbonaceous materials
(∼1315 and 1585 cm–1) were also visible after
aging in all four batches (Figure S3b–e); however, these band intensities were much lower in reacted ZVI
samples than in unreacted ZVI samples (Figure S3a).

These XRD and Raman results were supported by SEM
analyses (Supporting Information), which
also revealed
that iron oxides and hydroxides, including magnetite, lepidocrocite,
wüstite, and goethite, for during aging of ZVI. The presence
of these secondary minerals is consistent with the literature.34,35,46,56 Although magnetite and lepidocrocite are reported as stable end
products of ZVI aging, additional and minor constituents, such as
hematite,57 ferrihydrite,56 schwertmannite, milkasaite, and vivianite,48 have also been reported from ZVI aging experiments. These
minerals were, however, not observed in the spectral data of the current
study.

Solid-Phase Se Speciation
Selenium associated with
reacted ZVI solids was dominated by Se(IV) and Se(0) for all batches
(Figure 5a–c).
Results of linear combination fitting (LCF) analyses indicate that
Se(IV) and Se(0) account for >95% of Se on reacted ZVI from B1
and
B3 samples. This observation suggests that ZVI effectively reduces
Se(VI) to Se(IV) and Se(0) in the absence of sulfate. However, using
the LCF Se(0) content as a measure of the reduction extent, the results
(Table 2) indicate
that Se reduction in both B1 and B3 was the lowest in the CGPM samples
(mean Se(0) = 45%) and the highest in the QMP samples (mean Se(0)
= 64.4%).

 	QMP	21.2 (±1.1)	52.8 (±1.1)	32.2 (±2.8)	 	106.3	0.011	
This finding is illustrated by B3 LCF results (Figure S4), which exhibit Se(0) content following the general
order QMP > PM > CGPM. The mean Se(0) content of B1 samples
(55%)
was also slightly greater than that of B3 samples (52%), perhaps suggesting
that NO3– inhibits Se(VI) reduction by
ZVI. Se(IV) was the predominant oxidation state in B2 (mean = 66%)
and B4 (mean = 57%) samples (Table 2), whereas Se(0) accounted for 23% (B2) and 32% (B3).
Additionally, the mean Se(VI) content for B2 (17%) and B4 (17%) is
substantially greater than that for B1 (4%) and B3 (4%) samples. These
results indicate that SO42–, present
at 1800 mg L–1 in B2 and B4 batches, limited Se(VI)
reduction to Se(0) by ZVI. However, the extent of Se(VI) reduction
to Se(0) was slightly greater in B4 samples (mean Se(0) = 32%) compared
to that in B2 samples (mean Se(0) = 22.6%). This observation suggests
that NO3– somewhat diminishes the limiting
effect of SO42– on Se reduction by ZVI.
The proportions of Se(IV) and Se(0) were similar for CGPM and PM;
however, Se(0) was the dominant oxidation state for QMP.

The
LCF results for B1, B2, B3, and B4 samples suggest the presence
of other oxyanions, such as NO3– and
SO42–, with Se(VI) in solution limiting
the rate and extent of Se(VI) reduction by ZVI. The observed order
of the extent Se reduction in the samples tested is B1 > B3 >
B4 >
B2. The results of the analysis also indicate that the type of ZVI
also affects the extent of Se reduction associated with Se(VI) removal.
Generally, the observed order of Se(VI) reduction to either Se(IV)
or Se(0) from solution by the source of the ZVI is CGPM < PM <
QMP. These results are consistent with the modeled Se(VI) removal
rates (Table 1, Figure 2), which revealed
that Se(VI) removal was most effective for CGPM and PM than for QMP.
Nevertheless, Se(VI) removal rates in the presence of both NO3– and SO42– (i.e., B4) were slightly greater for QMP and PM than for CGPM.

The XANES results are consistent with limited published results
in the literature, where reduced Se species (i.e., Se(IV), Se(0),
and Se(−II)) are formed during Se(VI) removal by ZVI.34,35,58 The results of this study indicate
that Se(VI) removal involves the reduction of dissolved Se(VI) to
predominantly Se(IV) and Se(0), which are associated with ZVI surfaces.
The results also show that Se(VI) reduction and removal proceeded
in the presence of other oxyanions (i.e., NO3– and SO42–).

Conclusions
Contamination
of surface waters and groundwater by Se(VI) is a
global problem often associated with anthropogenic activities, including
mining and mineral processing. There is a pressing need to develop
cost-effective techniques for treating these waters. Sorption onto
Fe oxides and hydroxides is an important Se(VI) attenuation mechanism
in the environment.24,28,31 Adsorption capacity is surface-area-controlled, and Se(VI) removal
via this mechanism may, therefore, be limited. Recent studies have
demonstrated that ZVI can promote Se(VI) removal via adsorption and
reduction to low-solubility Se species.32,34,35,38,39 Unlike adsorption on iron oxides and hydroxides, the capacity for
Se(VI) removal by adsorption and reduction using ZVI is substantially
increased.59 However, the impact of competing
ions on Se(VI) removal by ZVI from mining-impacted waters, which commonly
contain high SO42– and NO3– concentrations, remains uncertain.

This
study evaluated Se(VI) removal rates and mechanisms for three
commercial ZVI materials under oxic and near-neutral pH conditions
and in the presence of SO42– and NO3–. Batch experiments revealed rapid Se(VI)
removal in the absence of both SO42– and
NO3–. Although Se(VI) removal rates decreased
substantially in the presence of NO3– and SO42–, >99% removal was achieved
over longer times. The Se(VI) removal process for all batches was
described by first-order reaction kinetics with the inclusion of a
residual Se(VI) component. In addition to Se(VI) removal, all of the
three ZVI exhibited the ability to partially remove NO3– via reduction and/or sorption mechanisms. Solid-phase
analyses revealed that Fe(0) oxidizes to magnetite, lepidocrocite,
wüstite, and goethite with time. Furthermore, XANES analyses
showed that Se(VI) was reduced to a mixture of Se(IV) and Se(0) associated
with ZVI solids. This study suggests that ZVI can effectively remove
Se(VI) from mining-impacted waters, which commonly contain elevated
SO42– and NO3– concentrations.

Materials and Methods
Zero-Valent Iron
Selenium(VI) removal rates and mechanisms
were examined using three commercially available ZVI materials: (1)
ground-cast Fe aggregate (ETI CC-1004; 0.368–2.36 mm) from
Connelly-GPM Inc. (CGPM; Chicago, IL); (2) ground-cast Fe aggregate
(8/50; 0.368–2.36 mm) from Peerless Metal Powder and Abrasives
(Detroit, MI); and (3) metallurgical granular Fe (H2Omet
58; 0.075–1.68 mm) from Rio Tinto Metal Powders (QMP; Montreal,
Canada). These ZVI materials contained >90% Fe with minor to trace
impurities, including C, O, S, Mn, V, Cu, and Cr (quantified by the
suppliers). The ZVI materials were used as received from the suppliers;
surface coatings were not removed before initiating the experiments.

Batch Experiments
Four batch experiments were conducted
to assess Se(VI) removal using all of the three ZVI materials. These
experiments included: (B1) Se(VI); (B2) Se(VI) + SO42–; (B3) Se(VI) + NO3–;
and (B4) Se(VI) + SO42– + NO3–. Solutions were prepared by dissolving NaSeO4 (0.0024 g) in 1 L of Type-1 ultrapure water (i.e., 18.2 MΩ
cm) and adding Na2SO4 (3.24 g) and NaNO3 (0.0753 g). These masses produced Se(VI), SO42–, and NO3—N concentrations of 1,
1800, and 15 mg L–1, respectively, which are consistent
with drainage from coal spoils.4,12 The solutions were
prepared in 2 L polyethylene (PE) beakers and continuously stirred
at 300 rpm under ambient conditions (i.e., ∼22 °C, atmospheric
O2) throughout the experiment. The experiment was initiated
by adding 10 g of ZVI to each solution such that Se(VI) removal by
each material (CGPM, PM, and QMP) was evaluated for each solution
(B1, B2, B3, and B4).

Water Sampling and Analysis
Water
sampling and geochemical
measurements were performed before initiating the experiment and subsequently
at time intervals of 30 min to 30 h for up to 200 h. Measurements
of pH and redox potential (Eh) were performed in conjunction with
water sampling. The pH electrode (VWR Symphony) was calibrated to
NIST-traceable 4, 7, and 10 buffer solutions. The electrode performance
was regularly checked, and recalibration was performed as necessary.
The performance of the redox electrode (Accumet) was verified using
ORP calibration solution (Orion). The water samples were collected
in PE syringes, passed through 0.2 μm polyethersulfone (PES)
syringe filter membranes, stored in high-density PE (HDPE) bottles,
and refrigerated until analysis. Inorganic anions (NO3–, NO2–, and SO42–) were quantified by ion chromatography (ICS2100;
Dionex Corporation) on nonacidified samples. Total Se was quantified
by inductively coupled plasma–optical emission spectroscopy
(SPECTROBLUE SOP, SPECTRO Analytical Instruments GmbH, Germany) on
samples acidified to pH < 2 with trace-metal-grade nitric acid
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). Spectrophotometric (DR2800; HACH Chemical
Co.) determination of total ammonium (NH4+)
concentrations (by the Nessler method) was performed for samples from
B3 and B4, which initially contained NO3–.

Solid-Phase Sampling and Analyses
Samples of the three
reacted ZVI materials (i.e., CGPM, PM, and QMP) from each batch (i.e.,
B1, B2, B3, and B4) were collected at the end of the experiment. These
samples were freeze-dried and refrigerated until analysis (up to 30
days). XRD, Raman spectroscopy (RS), SEM, and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface-area analyses were used to examine the physical, chemical,
and mineralogical characteristics of the three initial ZVI materials
(n = 3) and the reacted ZVI samples (n = 12). These samples were gently ground in an agate mortar and pestle
before analysis. Samples from each of the B1 batches were analyzed
to assess the reproducibility of the results. X-ray absorption near-edge
structure (XANES) spectroscopy was performed on the reacted ZVI samples
(n = 12) to examine Se speciation in the reaction
products.

XRD
Samples were mounted on glass plates, which were
then placed on a spinning reflection/transmission stage of an X-ray
diffractometer (Empyrean, PANalytical B.V., the Netherlands). The
power supply and Co X-ray tube were operated at 40 kV and 45 mA, respectively.
An incident beam path Fe Kβ-filter, 1° antiscatter slit,
0.02 mm Soller slits, and divergence and receiving slits each fixed
at 0.5° and spectral acquisitions were used during data acquisition.
Diffraction patterns were obtained from 10 to 80° with a step
size of 0.0167° and a scan speed of 1° min–1. Phase identification was performed using search-match software
(HighScore Plus, PANalytical B.V., the Netherlands) and the ICDD database
(International Center for Diffraction Data).

RS
The Raman microscope
(inVia Reflex, Renishaw plc,
U.K.) was equipped with a solid-state laser diode operated at 785
nm and 1200 lines mm–1 grating. Following wavenumber
calibration using an internal silicon standard (Raman shift, 520 cm–1), a few milligrams of each sample were placed on
a glass slide and viewed under a 20× N PLAN microscope objective
with 0.40 numerical aperture (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Germany). Backscattered
Raman signals were collected (32 spectral accumulations) with a Peltier-cooled
charge-coupled device detector, operated in the line focus confocal
mode with a 10 s detector exposure and 0.1% laser power.

SEM
Samples were mounted onto 10 mm aluminum pin stub
mounts using double-sided carbon tape. A 200 Å thick gold coating
was then applied using a plasma sputter coater (S150B; Edwards High
Vacuum, U.K.). Scanning electron images were obtained using an SEM
(JSM-840A; JEOL Ltd., Japan) with digital image acquisition system
(dPict7, MicroÅnalytical Laboratory Inc.). The SEM was operated
using a 20 kV acceleration voltage at 1500× magnification and
a 25 mm working distance.

Surface Area
The surface area was
quantified by obtaining
11-point BET-nitrogen isotherms (NOVA 2200e, Quantachrome
Instruments). The multipoint BET surface area of each sample was measured
at atmospheric pressure, and the adsorption isotherms achieved a p/p0 range of 0.05–0.35.
Samples were degassed at 70 °C for 24 h before analysis.

X-ray
Absorption Spectroscopy
Selenium K edge XAS spectra
were collected at the Hard X-ray Micro-Analysis beamline (HXMA-06ID-1)
at the Canadian Light Source (Saskatoon, Canada). The beamline utilizes
a 2 T superconducting wiggler with rhenium-coated mirrors for upstream
collimating and downstream beam focusing. Paired Si(111) crystals
were used to monochromatize the incident white beam. Higher harmonics
were rejected by detuning the second monochromator to 50% of the fully
tuned beam intensity. The monochromator step size was reduced to 0.25
eV in the XANES region, and constant 0.05 Å–1 steps in k-space were used in the extended X-ray
absorption fine structure (EXAFS) region to 9.2k.

Samples and reference materials were ground in an agate mortar
and pestle before being loaded into 0.5 mm thick poly(tetrafluoroethylene)
sample holders and sealed between two layers of polyimide tape. References
materials included Se(VI) (NaSeO4(s)) Se(IV) sorbed onto
ferrihydrite, Se(0) (Se(s)), and Se(−II) (FeSe(s)). The Se(VI), Se(0), and Se(−II) reference materials
were diluted with boron nitride. Sample spectra were collected under
ambient conditions in fluorescence mode using a 32-element solid-state
Ge detector (Canberra Industries Inc.). Aluminum foil, a Soller slit,
and an arsenic filter were placed between the sample and the detector
to reduce scattering and Fe fluorescence, which, therefore, enhance
the Se fluorescence signal. Reference spectra were collected in transmission
mode under ambient conditions between the first and second ionization
chamber detectors. Transmission spectra for Se foil positioned between
the second and third ionization chambers were used for energy calibration
during data reduction. Four spectra were collected and averaged for
all samples, whereas duplicate scans were collected and averaged for
each reference material.

The ATHENA module of the Demeter (v.0.9.24)
XAS software package45 was used for data
reduction and XANES analyses.
Individual Se K edge XAS scans were calibrated to the second derivative
zero crossing of the reference Se foil. Following calibration, replicate
scans were averaged to improve signal-to-noise ratios. Background
removal and normalization were subsequently performed on averaged
spectra. The relative percentages of Se redox species were assessed
for normalized XANES spectra using LCF over the energy range of 12 640–12 690
eV, assuming that this is representative of the sample as a whole.
The residual factors (R) of the best fits provided
a measure of the goodness of fit, with smaller values indicating a
better fit. The total values also reflected the goodness of fit as
the totals are not constrained in the fits, and, as such, better fits
are represented by the totals closest to 100.

Ammonium Desorption
Ammonium (NH4+) adsorbed onto ZVI during Se
removal in B4 batches was quantified
following desorption at acidic pH. Approximately 0.5 g of reacted
ZVI was combined with 119.5 mL of Type-1 ultrapure water in a 200
mL PE beaker to achieve a final volume of 120 mL. The solution was
stirred at 100 rpm for 5 min, and the pH was adjusted to 1 using 1
M HCl. Following 24 h of continuous stirring, 1 mL of solution was
passed through a 0.2 μm PES syringe filter, and NH4+ was quantified by spectrophotometry as previously described.

Modeling Selenium Removal Kinetics
Best-fit first-order
reaction rates for Se removal were determined using 4  where [A]t is
the Se concentration (mg L–1) at time t (h), [A]0 is the initial Se concentration (mg L–1), k is the rate constant (h–1), t is time (h), and r is the
residual aqueous Se concentration (mg L–1). The R2 values for the best fits are indicative of
the goodness of fits, where values closer to 1 indicate a better fit.
