We
present a theoretical study on the formation of graphene nanoribbons—via
polymerization of coronene molecules—inside the inner cavity
of boron nitride nanotubes. We examine the electronic property of
the hybrid system, and we show that the boron nitride nanotube does
not significantly alter the electronic properties of the encapsulated
graphene nanoribbon. Motivated by previous experimental works, we
examine graphene nanoribbons with two different widths and investigate
probable scenarios for defect formation and/or twisting of the resulting
graphene nanoribbons and their effect on the electronic properties
of the hybrid system.

Introduction
Graphene nanoribbons
(GNRs) with a tunable band gap, as a function
of width and edge configurations, are promising candidates for future
nanoscale electronic devices.1−8 GNRs can be obtained via a top-down procedure by selectively cutting
graphene sheets9,10 or unzipping carbon nanotubes,11−13 or in a bottom-up fashion via polymerization of small carbon-based
molecules (molecular building blocks).14−18 The latter is a more promising approach because it
offers better control over the width and edge configuration of GNRs
and the possibility for band gap engineering.19,20 The polymerization of the molecular building blocks is usually catalyzed
by an underlying thin film of Au or Ag,17,19 or promoted
by constraining the building blocks to a regular arrangement in the
inner cavity of nanotubes.15,16,21−23 Although the former approach (utilizing catalysts)
provides defect-free GNRs with well-defined edges, there is no control
over quantity, orientation, and length of the synthesized GNRs; additionally,
because of strong adhesion between the GNR and the underlying metallic
thin film, it is challenging to transfer the GNRs to another substrate
of choice. In contrast, the latter approach provides individual GNRs
inside nanotubes, where the GNR width, and to some extent also length,
are determined, respectively, by the diameter and the length of the
host nanotube.

It is known that the interaction of nanostructures
with the surrounding
environment, in particular a substrate, can alter associated electronic
properties.24,25 Therefore, freestanding (isolated)
nanostructures under an inert atmosphere might appear to be a preferred
configuration for nanodevice fabrication. However, such a geometry
is extremely challenging for practical technological applications.
The encapsulation of GNRs in the inner cavity of single-walled carbon
nanotubes (SWCNT) overcomes some of the difficulties, but because
SWCNTs are electronically active materials, they may negatively alter
the properties of the GNR and its function in electronic devices.
We recently reported the synthesis of GNRs in the inner cavity of
boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs),26 via
polymerization of coronene molecules, in which the high chemical and
thermal resistance of BNNTs protects the encapsulated GNR from ambient
degradation. The host BNNT, with a large electronic band gap, presumably
also acts as an electrically insulation layer for the encapsulated
GNRs, which in turn suggests a route for practical implementation
in integrated circuits.

Here, we theoretically probe such hypotheses
by means of density
functional theory (DFT). We study the encapsulation and structure
of coronene-based GNRs inside the inner cavity of BNNTs and show that
encapsulated GNRs do not significantly interact electronically with
the surrounding BNNT. We also examine different intermolecular interactions
between coronenes and possible defect formation and consequent effects
on the electronic properties of the host GNRs.

Results and Discussion
Encapsulated
GNRs inside BNNTs
Coronene is a symmetric
flat carbon-based molecule, in which the carbon atoms at the edges
form periodic zigzag–armchair configurations. The polymerization
of coronene molecules (confined within the inner cavity of a BNNT)
forms a nonmagnetic semiconductor GNR with irregular edges (see Figure 1a,b). The chemical
bonding between two coronene molecules can be realized either by formation
of a hexagonal ring (when two zigzag edges are facing each other,
see Figure 1a) or via
a pentagonal ring (when a zigzag edge faces an armchair edge, see Figure 1b). The former results
in the growth of a defect-free GNR with an electronic band gap (Eg) of 0.92 eV and a lattice parameter (along
the growth direction) of 8.65 Å. The latter case, on the other
hand, results in the formation of a defective GNR with a larger Eg of 1.52 eV (see Figure 1c,d). In both cases, the resulting GNR is
seven carbon atoms wide at its wider part; therefore, we denote this
GNR as “7-GNR” in the text. In both cases, the resulting
GNRs have irregular edges, with a mixture of zigzag and armchair sides
and a nonuniform width along the length of the GNR.4

7-GNR into the (12,12)-BNNT. Red (blue) indicates electron accumulation
(depletion). The iso-surfaces are plotted at 0.00005 eV/Å3 to see the effect; however, the charge transfer is negligible.

The interaction between encapsulated
GNRs and BNNTs is theoretically
investigated by introducing GNRs into a (12,12)-BNNT (7-GNR@(12,12)-BNNTs).
The (12,12)-BNNT exhibits an Eg equal
to 4.70 eV, which is in agreement with previous reports,27,28 and has a diameter of 16.5 Å, which ensures a minimum separation
distance of 3.6 Å from the GNR. There is a natural mismatch between
the lattice parameter along the growth direction of BNNTs and the
coronene-based GNRs. Thus, a supercell comprising a coronene dimer
(dicoronylene) and seven BNNT unit cells is used, resulting in a lattice
mismatch of 0.29 Å. This change in the lattice parameter slightly
increases the band gap, but its effect on the electronic properties
is insignificant as seen in Figure S1.
The optimized geometries of both composite systems, pristine and defective
7-GNRs@(12,12)-BNNTs, are depicted in Figure 1a,b. The interaction between GNRs and the
BNNT seems negligible, as the density of states (DOS) of the composite
system is basically a combination of both isolated components (see Figure 1c,d). The charge
density transfer (δn(r)) is
computed by performing a Bader charge analysis on the composite and
the individual components, the results of which are shown in Figure 1e,f. As expected,
the atoms located at the ribbon’s edge interact most strongly
with the BNNT’s wall, but the charge transfer is 100 times
smaller than that observed for metal–carbon interfaces,29,30 and such a small charge transfer does not appreciably modify the
electronic properties of the 7-GNRs@(12,12)-BNNTs.

GNRs may
also form via polymerization of dicoronylene molecules
(dimers of coronene) inside BNNTs of appropriate diameters.26 As depicted in Figure 2a, the likely polymerization of dicoronylene
molecules follows a regular pattern, in which the long, in-plane axis
of the molecules makes an angle of 30° with respect to its zigzag
vertical direction. The resulting GNR is 12 carbon atoms wide at its
wider section, and therefore, we denote it as the “pristine
12-GNR” in the text. A defective 12-GNR can also be constructed
by using the defective dicoronylene (in which the two coronenes are
chemically bonded together via a pentagon; see the previous section).
As illustrated in Figure 2b, the boundary between two defective dicoronylene molecules
contains 7- and 5-member carbon rings. The pristine 12-GNR exhibits
semiconductor behavior with a small Eg of 0.43 eV, whereas the defective 12-GNR exhibits a larger Eg of 0.75 eV and new localized states above
and below the Fermi level because of introduced defects. For 12-GNRs,
a (16,16)-BNNT is selected as a host with an Eg equal to 5.64 eV and a diameter of ∼22 Å, allowing
a graphene-tube separation distance of 3.3 Å. The optimized structures
are depicted in Figure S2. The DOS of both
composite systems are plotted in Figure 2c,d. Similar to the 7-GNRs case, these results
indicate that the interaction between the (16,16)-BNNT and the 12-GNR
is negligible. Similar results are observed when encapsulating purely
zigzag or armchair GNRs inside BNNTs, see Figure S3, clearly indicating that the edge morphology does not play
a significantly role in the interaction with the nanotube.

and (d) defective case. The carbon atoms in blue identify a dicoronylene
molecule unit within the 12-GNR.

Twisted GNRs
It has been shown that a freestanding
GNR may experience twisting along its axis with a well-defined periodicity.31,32 Such twisting is explained either by nonuniform stress along the
length of the GNRs because of the elongation of the edges relative
to the center of the GNR,33,34 or by compressive strain.35 Similarly, a GNR, encapsulated inside a nanotube,
may also exhibit twisting along the host tube axis.14,15,26,36 Below, we
study such a possibility for GNRs encapsulated in BNNTs and investigate
the properties of the resulting configurations.

The considered
GNRs are twisted by 180° (1π rad) at different twisting
rates (π rad/unit). Figure 3a,b depicts the optimized geometry of the nondefective
7- and 12-GNRs (see Figure S4 for more
information). The energy necessary to achieve 1π rad (twist
energy) is calculated as the energy difference between the flat and
twisted configuration, and the results for different twisting rates
are plotted in Figure 3c. In general, the twist energy is an increasing function of the
twisting rate. For the narrow 7-GNRs, the increase in energy is relatively
small when the twist occurs slowly (for instance, at a twist rate
of 0.25π rad/unit, the GNR completes a full twist over a length
of 3.25 nm, which requires an energy of 0.28 eV); however, it significantly
increases for a higher twisting rate (e.g., 2 eV at 0.5π rad/unit).
The electronic band gap of the twisted 7-GNRs exhibits a gradual increase
from 0.92 eV at a twist rate equal to zero, up to 1.41 eV at a twist
rate of 0.5π rad/unit; see Figure S5. For defective 7-GNRs, the increase in energy is similar at low
twisting rates when compared to the nondefective case (it makes little
or no difference), and only at a twist rate equal to 0.5π rad/unit,
a significant difference in energy becomes apparent (increase by 0.36
eV). Regarding the band gap, the defective 7-GNR exhibits a reduction
from 1.52 to 1.18 eV (Figure S6). However,
this reduction is not beneficial for electron transport as discussed
below. In fact, the reduced band gap is because of the appearance
of localized electronic states that act as scattering states, degrading
the electron transport, but enhancing the chemical reactivity. The
experimentally observed twisted GNR exhibited a nonperiodic twisting
with a twist length of approximately 1.7 nm,26 which corresponds to a twist rate of 0.5π rad/unit. In Figure 3c, the region corresponding
to experimental observation is indicated in gray, suggesting that
such twisting is energetically less probable compared to other examined
cases. The fact that the experimentally observed twisting for the
encapsulated GNR is not periodic suggests that the origin of the twist
is different from that for freestanding GNRs,34,35 and is possibly induced by formation of a local defective side.
Polymerization of coronene molecules can initiate from different points
along the length of the nanotube, which in turn result in the formation
of several GNR fragments (possibly with a slightly different orientation).
This induces defected (twisted) regions when the small GNRs join together.

Optimized structures of nondefective but twisted 12-GNR and
7-GNR at 0.25 and 0.5π rad/unit, respectively. (c) Energy required
for a half-turn (180°) at different twisting rates.

For the case of the wider 12-GNRs, the twist energy
is significantly
larger even at low twist rates (for instance, at 0.25π rad/unit,
the twist energy is 3.54 eV), suggesting that such cases might not
be physically realizable. This is rationalized by the internal strain
accumulated by the atoms in the basal plane, while the 7-GNR can cope
easily with such strain because of the single hexagonal (or pentagonal)
carbon ring that joins the coronene units. The twisted 12-GNR exhibits
a gradual increase in the band gap from 0.43 eV at twist rate zero
up to 0.62 eV at a twist rate of 0.25π rad/unit; see Figure S7. The defective 12-GNR exhibits a slight
increase in Eg; however, at the maximum
twist rate of 0.25π rad/unit, two large peaks appear at the
Fermi level (FL) associated to large internal strain located at the
pentagonal carbon rings, where the C–C distance increases to
cope with the twisted configuration (Figure S7). As we discuss shortly, these localized states severely hinder
the electron transport.

We next turn to the interaction of the
twisted GNRs with BNNTs.
The pristine and defective 7-GNRs which twist at 0.50π rad/unit
are encapsulated into a (12,12)-BNNT, with optimized geometries depicted
in Figure S8a,b. The DOS of the composite
system (Figure S8c) indicates that the
GNR-BNNT interaction is minimal, and the electronic properties near
the Fermi level are not affected at all. A similar study is performed
for pristine and defective 12-GNRs twisted at 0.25π rad/unit
encapsulated inside a (16,16)-BNNT. The optimized geometries can be
seen in Figure S8d,e. As expected, a comparison
of the DOS of the hybrid composite and the isolated components also
reveals a null interaction, similar to their planar counterpart (Figure S8f).

Electron Transport of Planar
and Twisted GNRs
The electron
transport characteristics are also investigated for the planar and
twisted configuration of all GNRs, with the modeled device configuration
depicted in Figure S9. Figure 4a shows the transmission function
(TF) of the pristine and defective 7-GNRs both in their planar and
twisted configuration. At the charge neutrality point, the TF of the
planar, nondefective 7-GNR exhibits a step-like behavior in the available
conducting channels. A quantum conductance of 2G0 (G0 = 2e2/h) is observed around the FL with a conductance
gap of 0.8 eV. Once the ribbon is twisted, a reduction in the TF is
observed at the valence and conduction bands, with the TF being less
pronounced at energies near the FL and slowly increasing at around
±1 eV. This has a significant effect on the current–voltage
(I–V) characteristics as
seen in Figure 4b.
The planar 7-GNR achieves a current of 8.2 μA at 1.7 V, while
the twisted configuration yields only 3.0 μA at similar bias,
a 63% reduction in current. The defective 7-GNR exhibits a completely
different TF in comparison with the pristine case; here, the conductance
gap is ∼0.9 eV, but there is a significant reduction in conductance
at the valence band, whereas at the conduction band, the conductance
is reduced to ∼1G0, half the value
of the nondefective counterpart. As a result, the defective 7-GNR
achieves only 0.9 μA at 1.7 V, 89% lower than the nondefective
7-GNR. After twisting, the TF for a defective 7-GNR is reduced even
further at the conduction band, resulting in a current of 0.6 μA
at 1.7 V, 93% lower in comparison to the 7-GNR. A summary is presented
in Table 1.

and Defective 7-
and 12-GNRs

twisted 12-GNR	0.62	23.3	3.5	
twisted defective 12-GNR	 	2.2	5.0	
For the 12-GNR case, the pristine and defective 12-GNR
exhibits
a conductance gap of 0.4 eV (Figure 4c). However, the defective ribbon has a significant
reduction in the TF at the valence and conduction bands with results
similar to the 7-GNR counterpart. After twisting both nanoribbons,
the TF is reduced as expected, and only the twisted and defective
12-GNR exhibits an increase in the conductance gap of 0.77 eV, resulting
in a larger turn-on voltage as observed in the I–V curve in Figure 4f. The current achieved at 1.7 V is reduced by 44, 61, and
95% for the twisted, defective, and twisted-defective 12-GNR, respectively,
in comparison with the planar, nondefective 12-GNR.

In summary,
theoretical modeling for the interaction of encapsulated
GNRs with a host BNNT is presented. The results reveal that encapsulated
GNRs do not interact with the host BNNT and that the electronic property
of the hybrid system is simply a mixture of two noninteracting systems.
The presence of structural defects (five and seven member rings) and
twisting of GNRs significantly compromises the electron transport,
but in general, it does not have any effect on the interaction between
the encapsulated GNRs and the host BNNT. The origin of twisting is
suggested to be the local defective sites at the junction of the GNR
fragments. The isolation of a GNR inside the inner cavity of the electrically
insulating BNNT provides a route for a possible implementation of
GNRs in complex electronic devices, in which the BNNT also acts as
a chemically robust protection layer for the encapsulated GNR.

Computational
Method
Electronic Properties
The electronic properties are
investigated using the DFT within the generalized gradient approximation
with the Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof parametrization37 as implemented in the SIESTA code.38 The valence electrons are represented by a linear combination of
pseudo-atomic numerical orbitals using a double-ζ polarized
basis.39 The real-space grid used for charge
and potential integration is equivalent to a plane wave cut-off energy
of 250 Ry. Periodic boundary conditions are used, and a distance of
25 Å is used to avoid lateral interactions. The Brillouin zones
are sampled only at the Γ point during geometric relaxation;
however, a K-grid of 1 × 1 × 16 is used
to obtain the DOS. All systems are relaxed using a variable cell scheme
by conjugate gradient minimization until the maximum force is <0.04
eV/Å. Note that dispersion forces are not considered during the
structural optimization, and the addition of such forces is not expected
to alter the final configuration.

Electronic Transport
The electronic transport characteristics
are investigated by the nonequilibrium Green’s function techniques40 within the Keldysh formalism using the Atomistix
ToolKit 2016.4 software.41 The electronic
transport calculations are performed by obtaining well-converged electrodes
using the 1 × 1 × 301 Monkhorst–Pack K-grid for sampling the 1D-Brillouin zone and 1 × 1 × 101 K-grid for the scattering region. A real-space grid of 250
Ry and single-ζ polarized (SZP) basis are used. Previous studies
have confirmed that the use of such an SZP basis size is appropriate
for carbon-based systems.42,43 The devices consist
of a two-probe system where coronene-based nanoribbons (8.65 Å)
are used as semi-infinite left and right electrodes. The scattering
region consists of pristine and defective GNRs with a total length
of ∼34 Å, and for twisted GNRs, the scattering regions
have a length of ∼50 Å.

Charge Analysis
The Bader charge analysis44,45 is used to determine
the transferred electronic charge among components
using the optimized geometries and 250 Ry as energy cutoff for the
real-space grid. The charge density difference δn(r) is obtained by subtracting the charge densities
of the individual components (GNR and BNNT) from the composite systems,
δn(r) = n(r)Total – n(r)GNR – n(r)BNNT. The charge densities of the isolated components
are computed by maintaining the geometry in the composite system.
