The
coupling of thioamides and donor/acceptor-substituted diazocarbonyl
compounds is reported for the first time. The present report provides
a mild, catalytic method that couples thioamides and donor/acceptor-substituted
diazocarbonyl compounds to form enamino esters and enaminones. Unlike
traditional methods for the synthesis of enamino esters and enaminones
from thioamides, both N-alkyl thioamides and thiocarbamates are suitable
substrates in this coupling reaction. Copper(I) bromide catalyzes
the reaction and provides enamino esters and enaminones chemo- and
diastereoselectively in less time than Rh2(OAc)4 or Ru(PPh3)3Cl2 catalysts.

Introduction
Enamino esters and
enaminones are important synthetic intermediates.1−6 They have been used in the synthesis of a number of natural products
and pharmaceutically active compounds.3,7,8 Because of this importance, various methods are available
for enamino ester and enaminone synthesis2,9−19 and new methods are constantly pursued.20−27 Exocyclic enamino esters and enaminones are generally prepared by
the Eschenmoser sulfide contraction reaction (ESR)7,28−30 or the imino ester (imidate) approach.28,31−33 Both methods complement each other. In the ESR, a
thioamide is the nucleophile, while in the imidate approach, an amide
is converted into an electrophile. However, both methods are sensitive
to steric hindrance,7,28 and neither of them is shown
to be suitable when the nitrogen of a thioamide or an amide is protected
as a carbamate34—one of the most
common nitrogen atom protection strategies. A thio-Reformatsky-type
reaction does exist that couples thiocarbamates and bromocarbonyl
compounds to prepare enamino esters. However, the reaction has limited
substrate scope, is noncatalytic, and only provides trisubstituted
enamino esters.34 The reaction of thioamides
with diazo electrophiles to form enamino esters, and enaminones is
a modified version of the ESR reaction. The modified version overcomes
steric issues associated with the ESR reaction.7 So far, this modified version of the ESR has not been achieved
for the cross-coupling of thioamides with the donor/acceptor-substituted
carbenoids. The reactivity profile of a carbenoid is dependent upon
the structure of a carbenoid.35 Thus, donor/acceptor-substituted
carbenoids are expected to have a different reactivity profile than
other carbenoids that have been reported previously in the formation
of enamino esters and enaminones (Figure 1). Furthermore, there are no reports of the
modified ESR in which the starting thioamide’s nitrogen is
protected as a carbamate.7 N-Alkyl and
N-Boc thioamides are electronically very different from each other
and tend to reflect this in their reactivity toward electrophiles.34 In this report, a method is described which
overcomes these deficiencies of the coupling reaction between thioamides
and diazo compounds (Figure 1). The reaction uses a catalytic amount of copper(I) bromide
and provides products stereoselectively.

of exocyclic enaminoesters and enaminones.

Results and Discussion
The catalyst screening was conducted
on thioamide 1a and diazo compound 2a (Table 1). Dichloroethane
was chosen as the solvent
as it provides good yields of enamino esters and enaminones in the
related copper-catalyzed coupling of thioamides and acceptor/acceptor-substituted
carbenoids.36,37 No reaction was observed with
selected copper salts at room temperature (entries 1–3, Table 1). The reaction initiated
at 40 °C and provided enamino ester 3 (entries 4–12, Table 1). A full consumption
of thioamide 1 was observed with various copper(I) catalysts
(entries 4–9 and 12, Table 1). Copper(I) chloride consumed 1 the fastest,
but did not provide a good yield of the isolated enamino ester (entry
5, Table 1). Copper(I)
triflate, which is the best commercial copper catalyst for the coupling
of thioamides and acceptor/acceptor-substituted carbenes,37 was also a successful catalyst in this transformation
(entry 12, Table 1).
However, both CuBr and CuI provided 100% conversion of the enamino
ester 3 in the shortest period of time. Copper(I) bromide
is more economical than CuI, and thus it was chosen to study the substrate
scope. No reaction was observed in the absence of a catalyst (entry
13, Table 1). Greener
solvent (EtOH) gave low percent conversion (entry 18, Table 1).

Dirhodium(II)
catalysts are considered the most effective in diazo
decomposition.38 However, 2.5 mol % of
Rh2(OAc)4 did not give a quantitative yield
of 3, and both 1 and 2 remained
(entry 14, Table 1)
in the reaction mixture even after 16 h. Some dimer formation of 2 was also observed in this reaction. Increasing the catalyst
loading (5 mol %) also gave similar results (entry 15, Table 1) and starting materials 1 and 2 were not consumed completely even after
17 h. Ruthenium(II) catalysts are successful in the coupling of thioamides
and acceptor/acceptor-substituted diazo compound.39 For the synthesis of 3a though, Ru(PPh3)3Cl2 gave a low yield of 3a (entry 16, Table 1). These results conclude that CuBr and CuI are not only more economical
catalysts in this transformation, but they are also more efficient
than the studied rhodium(II) and ruthenium(II) catalysts. Finally,
BF3·OEt was attempted in the reaction (entry 17) as
it has shown to be one of the best Lewis acids in many Lewis-acid
promoted reactions of diazo compounds40−46 and has been used to promote sulfur extrusions in the ESR reaction.7,28,29 The reaction failed to give the
enamino ester and within 10 min. all 2a dimerized at
room temperature. This result suggests that the formation of 3a in the presence of copper catalysts is not a Lewis-acid
catalyzed reaction.

The scope of thioamides was evaluated in
this reaction. The N-alkyl
and N-Boc thioamides were tested (Table 2). Both cyclic- and acyclic-positioned thioamides
gave coupled products (3a, 3b, and 3c–3i) in good yield and gave predominantly
the E isomer. The stereochemistry was assigned using 2D-NOESY experiments.
The diastereomeric ratios observed (except for 3b) are
likely due to the low energy barrier to C=C rotation which
precludes the isolation of any one isomer at room temperature. This
hypothesis is supported by the fact that the variable-temperature 1H NMR spectra of 3d show a change in the ratio
of E/Z isomers with decreasing temperatures (Supporting Information). The 1H NMR spectra of 3d also show typical broadening of resonances with decreasing temperatures
which are indicative of temperatures approaching the coalescence point
(Supporting Information). A similar E/Z
isomerism has been reported previously.47−50 In the case of 3b, in addition to the 2D-NOESY, the 1D NOESY technique was used to
confirm the stereochemistry and differentiate rotamers from diastereomers.51 Enamino ester 3b is the first example
of the metal-catalyzed coupling reaction of thioamides and diazo compounds
where the nitrogen atom is protected as a carbamate. As 3b is electronically different than 3a, we tested the
formation of 3b against Ru(II) and Rh(II) catalysts.
At room temperature, 1b and 2a failed to
react in the presence of 2.5 mol % Rh2(OAc)4 and upon heating at 40 °C, 2a dimerized completely.
In the presence of 5 mol % Ru(PPh)3Cl2, at 40
°C, no reaction was observed. FeCl3 (10 mol %) was
used to check the possibility of a Lewis acid-catalyzed formation
of 3b at 40 °C. FeCl3 was attempted
instead of BF3·OEt as BF3·OEt is expected
to N-deprotect the Boc group.52 The N-Boc
deprotection of 1b is unlikely in the presence of FeCl3.53 However, the coupling of 1b and 2a again failed to provide 3b. These results clearly show that Cu(I)Br is a superior catalyst
in this transformation.

Next, the
scope of diazo compounds was studied (Table 3). Both N-Me and N-Boc thioamides 1 gave good yields of enamino esters and an enaminone with
a variety of donor/acceptor-substituted diazo compounds 2. Formation of N-Boc-protected enaminones consistently required less
time than N-Me counterparts. Benzyl ester containing diazo compounds
reacted faster than methyl or ethyl ester containing diazo compounds
(compare 3k vs 3a and 3o vs 3b and 3n). Electron-donating groups on the donor
side of diazo compounds gave enaminones in higher yields and in less
time (compare 3j vs 3m and 3q vs 3r). Higher temperature (60 °C) was required
with α-unsubstituted diazoketone and the reaction remained incomplete
even after 24 h (3s). Although α-diazocarbonyl
compounds are known to undergo C–H insertion and Buchner reactions,38,54 in all reactions reported here, except for the formation of 3, and a negligible dimerization of 2, no other
products were observed. The stereochemistry of products 3j–3s (except 3l) was assigned using
1D- and 2D-NOESY experiments (Supporting Information). 3l did not show any diagnostic NOE enhancements.
Its stereochemistry was assigned as E after comparing with the chemical
shift values of related compounds (Supporting Information). In the case of carbamates, the 1D NOESY technique
was also used to confirm the stereochemistry and/or to differentiate
diastereomers from rotamers (Supporting Information).51 Unlike the N-alkyl series, with the
N-Boc-protected enamino esters, we suspected no E/Z equilibration
because the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom is expected
to be delocalized on the carbamate carbonyl. Indeed, variable-temperature 1H NMR spectra of 3q showed no change in the ratio
of E/Z isomers with decreasing temperatures (Supporting Information). The reaction of vinyl diazoacetate with 2g gave enamino ester 3t as a mixture of isomers.
The complex 1H NMR spectrum suggests that 3t is under an E/Z equilibration due to conjugation.

2-Nap = 2-naphthyl.

In order
to determine if the reaction is chemoselective, 1b was
reacted with 2b (Scheme 1). Diazocarbonyl 2b is known
to undergo an intramolecular cyclopropanation reaction with Rh(II)
and Cu(I) catalysts.55−57 Under the reaction conditions, 3u was
obtained selectively without any formation of 4. In the
absence of thioamide 1a, 2b produced 4 upon reaction with CuBr, albeit in a low yield. These results
again show that CuBr is a selective and superior catalyst in this
transformation.

Scheme 1 Competition Experiments: Enamino Ester Formation vs
Cyclopropanation
Reaction
The abovementioned
results can be explained via the mechanism that
we have proposed (Scheme 2) previously for the reaction between thioamides and acceptor/acceptor-substituted
diazo compounds.37 Formation of carbenoids
is supported by literature38,58 and by the fact that
the replacement of CuBr with Lewis acids fails to provide enamino
esters. Nucleophilic attack of thioamide on the carbenoid gives metal-associated
ylide 5. Copper dissociates from ylide 5 giving metal-free ylide 6, which is under an equilibrium
with the thioether59 when the thioamide
is a primary or secondary thioamide [as expected, the coupling reaction
between 2a and a secondary thioamide (1k, Supporting Information), provided a
thioether (9, Supporting Information)]. Ylides 5 or 6 can cyclize to give episulfide 7, which upon sulfur extrusion provides enamino ester 8. Formation of 5 is based on the observation
that thioamide 1b, which is more nucleophilic than an
alkene, tends to give enamino ester 3u, and in the absence
of a thioamide a less nucleophilic alkene can react with the carbenoid
giving 4 (Scheme 1). Formation of thioether suggests the formation of metal-free
ylide 6. Less time for the formation of N-Boc enamino
esters versus N-alkyl enamino ester [Table 2 (3b vs 3a), and Table 3] is perhaps due to
a slow sulfide contraction process (5 → 7) in the case of amines compared with carbamates. This is
because, in N-Boc 5, the iminium carbon is more electrophilic
than it is in N-alkyl 5 iminium carbon, which makes N-Boc 5 more reactive. Electron-donating substituents on diazo compounds
(3b vs 3o and 3a vs 3k and Table 3) accelerate
the formation of enamino esters as 5 is expected to be
more reactive with electronically rich R4. Sulfur extrusion
(7 → 8) happens with37 or without the aid of CuBr.7

Scheme 2 Proposed Mechanism for Copper-Catalyzed Coupling Reaction between
Thioamides and Donor/Acceptor-Substituted Diazo Compounds
Conclusions
In
summary, coupling reactions between donor/acceptor-substituted
diazo compounds and tertiary thioamides have been realized for the
first time. Unlike the traditional ESR reaction,7 both N-alkyl thioamides and thiocarbamates can undergo
this reaction to provide corresponding enamino esters. The reaction
also gives enaminones. Copper(I) bromide is a more efficient catalyst
in this transformation than Rh(II) or Ru(II) catalysts that have been
previously reported with other classes of diazo compounds.7 Copper(I) bromide is also the most inexpensive
catalyst reported so far in the coupling reaction of thioamides and
diazo compounds.

Experimental Section
General Experimental
1H and 13C NMR and 1D- and 2D-NOESY experiments
were performed on a Varian
400/50 (400 MHz) spectrometer. Dr. Margaret Eastman performed variable-temperature 1H NMR experiments on a Varian Inova 400 MHz instrument at
the Oklahoma State University’s Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
Facility. All NMR spectra were measured in parts per million (ppm)
relative to the residual solvent signals (CDCl3 for 1H NMR δ = 7.27 ppm and 13C NMR δ =
77.0 ppm). Infrared spectroscopy was performed on a Thermo Scientific
Nicolet iS50 spectrometer. Absorption maxima of selected peaks are
reported in wave numbers (cm–1). High-resolution
mass spectrometric measurements were conducted on a Thermo Scientific
Exactive or Fusion spectrometer operating in a positive ion electrospray
mode using an orbitrap analyzer at a normal resolution of 500 000.
Thin-layer chromatography was performed on 250 μm glass silica
gel plates. Plates were visualized with UV and/or a basic aqueous
potassium permanganate stain. Retention factor (Rf) values are reported along with the solvent system in
parenthesis. Flash chromatography was performed on a sorbent silica
gel 60 Å (40–63 μm). Petroleum ether refers to the
fraction of the mixture that distills between 30 and 60 °C. Anhydrous
dichloroethane was obtained by distilling it from calcium hydride
and onto activated 4 Å molecular sieves. All other reagents were
obtained from commercial sources and used without further purification.
Unless specified, all reactions were carried out under an inert atmosphere
(argon) with oven-dried glassware.

Experimental Procedure
for the Synthesis of Thioamides
All thioamide synthesis was
conducted under noninert conditions.

(S)-1-tert-Butyl 2-Ethyl 5-Thioxopyrrolidine-1,2-dicarboxylate

Compound 1b was prepared by
modifying a procedure used for the preparation of 1-tert-butyl 3-methyl-5-thioxopyrrolidine-1,3-dicarboxylate.60 (S)-Ethyl 5-thioxypyrrolidine-2-carboxylate
(1.24 g, 7.14 mmol),61 4-DMAP (872 mg,
7.14 mmol), and Et3N (1.00 mL, 7.14 mmol) were transferred
into a 100 mL round-bottom flask. Then, 25.0 mL anhydrous dichloromethane
was added to the mixture under an inert atmosphere. The solution was
stirred and cooled to −80 °C. Di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (Boc)2O (1.56 g, 7.14 mmol) was dissolved
in 15.0 mL anhydrous dichloromethane and added dropwise to the reaction
mixture. The flask containing the (Boc)2O was rinsed twice
with 5.00 mL anhydrous DCM and the contents were transferred to the
reaction mixture. It was stirred for an additional 48 h at −80
°C, allowed to come to room temperature, and the solvent was
evaporated. The crude reaction mixture was charged into a silica gel

Ethyl 2-phenylacetate
(1.63 g, 10.0 mmol) was
dissolved in 15.0 mL anhydrous acetonitrile. Tosyl azide (2.37 g,
12.0 mmol) was dissolved in 10.0 mL anhydrous acetonitrile and added
to the above solution. The vial containing tosyl azide was washed
once with 5.00 mL anhydrous acetonitrile and the contents were transferred
to the reaction mixture. The reaction vessel was cooled to 0 °C
and DBU (2.25 mL, 15.0 mmol) was added dropwise to the stirred solution.
The reaction mixture was allowed to come to room temperature overnight.
The mixture was concentrated and the crude was purified by column
chromatography using a short column (10% ethyl acetate in petroleum
ether). It afforded pure 2a (1.56 g, 8.20 mmol, 82%)

The reaction mixture was allowed to come to room temperature overnight.
The mixture was concentrated and the crude was purified by column
chromatography using a short column (5% ethyl acetate in petroleum
