Transfer
RNA remains to be a mysterious molecule of the cell repertoire.
With its modified bases and selectivity of codon recognition, it remains
to be flexible inside the ribosomal machinery for smooth and hassle-free
protein biosynthesis. Structural changes occurring in tRNA due to
the presence or absence of wybutosine, with and without Mg2+ ions, have remained a point of interest for structural biologists.
Very few studies have come to a conclusion correlating the changes
either with the structure and flexibility or with the codon recognition.
Considering the above facts, we have implemented molecular modeling
methods to address these problems using multiple molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations of tRNAPhe along with codons. Our results
highlight some of the earlier findings and also shed light on some
novel structural and functional aspects. Changes in the stability
of tRNAPhe in native or codon-bound states result from
the conformations of constituent nucleotides with respect to each
other. A smaller change in their conformations leads to structural
distortions in the base-pairing geometry and eventually in the ribose-phosphate
backbone. MD simulation studies highlight the preference of UUC codons
over UUU by tRNAPhe in the presence of wybutosine and Mg2+ ions. This study also suggests that magnesium ions are required
by tRNAPhe for proper recognition of UUC/UUU codons during
ribosomal interactions with tRNA.

1 Introduction
Protein biosynthesis is an essential process crucial to the survival
of every living cell. Various biological macromolecules contribute
critically to run a smooth and in-phase functioning of this process.1 Transfer RNA is a key molecule that acts as an
adapter to decode the genetic code into a functional array of a variety
of proteins.2 It is well known that tRNA
has an inverted-L-like three-dimensional (3D) structure. This 3D orientation
of the molecule is one of the key features that govern its stability
and interactivity.3 Similar to other biomolecules,
tRNA also shows structure-dependant functional properties, which can
be seen through its stability and interactions with codons.4 Also, its proper 3D fold is essential for its
interactions with various proteins and the decoding center itself.5 tRNA is unique in its base composition as it
encompasses a variety of modified nucleic acid bases in addition to
the usual RNA bases, A, U, G, and C.6 Various
studies have reported that these modified bases are crucial elements
contributing to various properties of the molecule.7−14 Some studies also show that the absence of a specific modified nucleoside
in tRNA causes structural deformities, which in turn cause considerable
damage to native functions of the molecule.14−17

The presence of the hypermodified
nucleoside, wybutosine, at the
37th position in tRNA and its structural and functional
effects have remained a topic of discussion over the years.18−24 It has been well documented that wybutosine exhibits multiple conformations
in the anticodon stem loop.22,24 It has also been proved
that in the absence of wybutosine HIV replication progresses faster.25

This study was undertaken to understand
the role of modified nucleoside
wybutosine present at the 37th position in tRNAPhe. Wybutosine and its derivatives are known to play a crucial role
during codon recognition. They are reported to support the codon–anticodon
base pairing by maintaining a proper translational reading frame26 and also by preventing the formation of extended
Watson–Crick base pairing.14 Various
other bases present at the 37th position in tRNA are also
known to support the codon recognition process by some cooperative
interactions with the base present at the 34th (wobble)
position.27 The structural properties of
hypermodified base wybutosine have been documented by various research
groups over decades.18,24,28−33 In the present study, we have tried to explore its structural and
functional role during the codon–anticodon recognition process.
The results of this study will be helpful in understanding the pattern
of UUC/UUU codon recognition by yeast phenylalanine tRNA. Also, the
preference in codon recognition under various physiological conditions
can be understood. Prevention of ribosomal slippage during codon recognition
due to the presence of wybutosine can probably be seen in the presence
and absence of wybutosine with the two cognate codons (UUC/UUU). This
phenomenon is of critical importance to study the initial steps of
retroviral replication.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Stability of the Whole tRNAPhe Molecule
RMS deviations of the ribose-phosphate backbone were used to evaluate
the stability of all model systems (Figure 1). We noticed that the RMSD for the whole
tRNA molecule shows occasional fluctuations for all models. Comparatively,
the RMSD for model 1 (Figure 2) shows stability as compared to that for model 2. Similar
stability is also observed in the case of models 3 and 5 as compared
to the lower stability of models 4 and 6, respectively (Figures 3 and 4). These changes in the RMSD of multiple models are correlated with
the structure of the tRNA molecule, and it is found that the molecule
shows minute conformational changes within its component domains,
which are reflected in such RMS deviations in systems. RMSD observations
for the whole tRNA systems seem to be a cumulative effect of the dynamics
of its component domains on the whole tRNA structure. Overall, the
systems show a higher level of dynamism in the structures with respect
to time, which can be accorded to changes occurring in various loop
regions of the tRNA molecule (Figure 5a). From this RMSD analysis, it can be inferred that
model 3 (tRNA without Mg2+) shows a smaller RMSD than model
4, which contains Mg2+. Similarly, among the codon-bound
models, model 7 and model 5 show a smaller RMSD as compared to models
1, 2 and models 6, 8, respectively (Figures 2–4).

2.2 Stability
of the ACL, ASL, T-Loop, and D-Loop
Domains of tRNA
Transfer RNA comprises various component
domains, such as the D-loop, ACL, ASL, and T-loop. All of these loops
coordinate with each other structurally and make the tRNA molecule
ready for further functions. Primarily, these loops are crucial to
maintain the 3D fold of tRNA. During maturation of tRNA, the D- and
T-loops fold over each other such that the T-loop region folds back
over the D-loop. Thus, the D-loop is involved in stabilization of
the 3D structure of the tRNA molecule. The D-loop structure is also
essential for recognition of the tRNA molecule by aminoacyl tRNA synthetases.42,43 Similarly, the importance of the anticodon loop and anticodon stem
loop has been well documented in previous reports.13,17 Hence, the stability of these component domains was individually
assessed to check for local structural changes with the help of parameters
such as the RMSD or structural visualization.

From RMSD results,
it was observed that the whole tRNAPhe shows some significant
structural changes. However, RMSD analysis of the ACL, ASL, T-loop,
and D-loop shows stability, which could be useful to determine the
structure and function of tRNAPhe. Four constituent loops,
viz., di-hydro-uridine (D-loop), anticodon stem loop (ASL), anticodon
loop (ACL), and TψC or T-loop of the molecule, were considered
for detailed RMSD analysis.

The RMSD of the D-loop (residue
no. 10–25) shows smaller
values in the case of models 1, 4, and 6 as compared to those of their
respective control models 2, 3, and 5. From the figure (Figure 6), it can be easily seen that
the RMSD of model 1 (green) is considerably lower as compared to that
of model 2 (red). In the case of model 3, the RMSD is larger as compared
to model 4. Also, in the case of model 5, the RMSD is seen to be larger
as compared to model 6. This behavior of the molecule from models
2 and 6 (both in the absence of WBG) suggests the occurrence of local
conformational changes in the backbone residues of the D-loop. This
change can also be correlated with the changes observed in Figure 5, wherein a structural
change in models 2 and 6 can be seen as compared to their control
models 1 and 5. From these observations, it can be seen that the presence
and absence of wybutosine has a distinguishable effect on the stability
of the D-loop (Figure 6).

Figure 6 RMSD of the D-loop describing stability of various models.

RMSD analysis for the anticodon step loop (ASL)
region (residue
no. 27–43) is depicted in Figure 7, in which models 1 and 2 show similar behavior
with occasional variations. ASL regions of models 3 and 4 show a stable
RMSD of model 3 (green) as compared to the fluctuating RMSD of model
4 (yellow). In models 5 and 6 (Figure 8), the effect of the presence and absence of wybutosine
on the binding of UUU codons can be seen. In spite of the presence
of wybutosine at the 37th position, the RMS deviation observed
in model 5 (Figure 8) is an indication of the codon preference for UUC over UUU of tRNAPhe.28 Comparing the RMSD of models
1, 2 and 5, 6 for codon preference (Figures 2 and 8), one can observe
that tRNAPhe in the presence of wybutosine can recognize
UUC codons more preferably over UUU codons. It can also recognize
UUU codons but with some structural adjustments in the tRNA.

anticodon stem loop describing the stability of various
models.

Figure 8 RMSD of the anticodon stem loop describing the
stability of various
models.

The anticodon loop (ACL) region
(residue no. 32–38) is crucial
to the function of each tRNA as it actually influences the codon–anticodon
interactions. The RMSD for this region of tRNA for all models is depicted
in Figure 9. This domain
of the tRNA molecule shows more dynamics as compared to other domains.
This might occur due to the presence of various modifications and
also because of the open-loop structure itself.44 Hence, the RMSD for model 1 shows more deviations as compared
to that for model 2, while model 7 shows the least deviations as compared
to models 1 and 2. In the case of model 1, the presence of WBG and
Mg2+ might be a strong reason for occasional RMS deviations,
which might, otherwise, get compensated for by the absence of WBG
in the case of model 2. This presence and absence of WBG show changes
in the conformation of the ACL, which is evident from Figure 5. The ACL can also be seen
affected by the presence or absence of Mg2+ ions. From
the RMSD of the ACL (Figure 9), it can be seen that the absence of Mg2+ in models
3, 7, and 8 imparts more stability to the ACL as compared to models
4, 1, and 5, correspondingly. The presence of Mg2+ highly
destabilizes the ACL in the case of model 4. The ACL RMSDs of models
1 and 2 show occasional fluctuations. Similar fluctuations are also
observed in the case of models 5 and 6, where model 5 shows higher
deviations as compared to model 6. This behavior of model 5 in the
presence of wybutosine can be correlated with a previous study,28 wherein it has been experimentally demonstrated
that tRNAPhe prefers UUC over UUU codons.

Figure 9 RMSD of the anticodon
loop describing the stability of various
models.

The RMSD for the TψC loop
(residue no. 49–65) is depicted
in Figure 10. Model
1 shows a stable RMSD as compared to model 2, while models 3 and 4
both show similar RMSDs with minute fluctuations. Contrary to this,
the RMSD for model 5 is less stable as compared to that for model
6. This suggests that interactions with the UUU codon influence the
structure of tRNAPhe. Overall, the structure of the TψC
loop is highly affected by either the presence or absence of wybutosine
and of the UUC/UUU codons. The presence of wybutosine lowers the RMSD
in the case of model 1 as compared to that of model 2 (Figure 10), while its absence in model
6 lowers the deviations in the backbone of the T-loop in comparison
with model 5, favoring recognition of UUU codons. Hence, it can be
easily concluded that the presence or absence of WBG in models 5 and
6 has a minor effect on the structure of the TΨC loop. The RMSDs
of models 3 and 4 (Figure 10) show that the absence or presence of Mg2+ does
not hamper the TψC loop structure.

Figure 10 RMSD of the TΨC
loop describing stability of various models.

2.3 RMSF
RMS fluctuations of all eight
models along with RMSFs of their constituent loops have been calculated
and are depicted in Figure 11. RMSFs for whole tRNA with UUC/UUU codons indicate that residues
from models 1 and 5 show smaller atomic fluctuations as compared to
those from models 2 and 6, respectively. In the case of models 3 and
4, RMS fluctuations can be seen to increase for model 4, while RMS
fluctuations in the case of model 3 are comparatively lower. From
the RMSF of the ASL (Figure 12), it can be clearly seen that models 1 and 5 show a reduced
level of RMSF as compared to models 2 and 6. Overall, the RMSF results
indicate that the presence of wybutosine is essential for codon recognition.
Similarly, it is also evident that binding of codons induces structural
changes in the tRNA molecule; essentially in the D-loop, ASL, ACL,
and TψC loop domains. The RMSF of the ASL suggests that codon
binding residues from 34 to 36 along with wybutosine at the 37th position show elevated fluctuations.

Figure 11 RMSF of the whole tRNAPhe of various models.

Figure 12 RMSF
of the anticodon stem loop of tRNAPhe of various
models.

Hence, correlating the RMSD and
RMSF results, we can observe that
model 1 represents the exact native state of the molecule describing
comparatively lower RMSD and RMSF values, especially in the ASL region
of the molecule. The presence of wybutosine is helpful in recognizing
UUC codons, while in its absence, UUU codons can be read.45,46 The function of Mg2+ ions can be better understood by
considering the ribosomal environment in simulation. Auffinger in
1995 also reported similar structural stability of tRNAAsp in the absence of Mg2+.47 We
would like to highlight at this point that though Mg2+ is
essential for in vivo activity of the molecule, it has lower contribution
toward governing the structure of the molecule.46

2.4 Analysis of Base Stacking
Base stacking
interactions within tRNAPhe of all eight models were analyzed
for their stable behavior. For this purpose, representative base pairs
of each of the stem loops were monitored. Out of these, the interaction
between A31···PSU39 (Figure 13) is indicative
of the level of base stacking within the ASL,48 while terminal base stacking interactions between G1···C72 (Figure 14a–c) show the effect of structural conservation or distortion
occurring in the overall structure of all models.

Figure 13 U-turn feature of the
anticodon stem loop of various tRNAPhe models.

Figure 14 (a–c) Base stacking interaction of the first base pair of
various tRNAPhe models.

The base stacking interaction between N(1)A31···H(3)PSU39, which is indicative of the typical U-turn feature of tRNA,
is seen to be well maintained only in the case of models 1 and 5,
whereas it fluctuates for models 2 and 6 (Figure 13). This indicates that base stacking within
the ASL of models 2 and 6 is disturbed, while that of models 1 and
5 is well conserved. Similarly, the terminal base stacking interaction
between G1···C72 is assessed
with the help of three interactions, viz., H(1)G1···N(2)C72, H(21)G1···O(2)C72,
and O(6)G1···H(41)C72 (Figure 14a–c). Overall,
these interactions show a high level of distortions in the last base
stacking pair, i.e., G1···C72 only for models 2 and 6. This shows that the interactions are well
maintained in the presence of wybutosine, i.e., for models 1 and 5.

2.5 Binding Free Energy Analysis
Binding
free energy analysis was performed to determine the strength of bonds
formed between the codons and anticodons for each model. MM-PBSA results
(Figure 15a–c
and Table 1) suggest
that binding of codons in the case of models 1 and 5 is more energetically
favorable than that seen in the case of models 2 and 6.

energy of all tRNAPhe models with their
respective codons. (b) Binding energy of models 1, 2, and 7 (tRNAPhe with UUC codons). (c) Binding energy of models 5, 6, and

Models 1 and 5, containing
wybutosine at the 37th position,
show average binding energies of −18.597 and −13.808
kcal/mol, respectively, while for models 2 and 6, the average binding
energy values recorded are −10.532 and −9.11 kcal/mol.
This analysis suggests that model 1 having wybutosine at the 37th position and UUC codon is energetically more favorable than
model 2 lacking wybutosine at the 37th position and with
UUC codon. Similarly, in the presence of wybutosine, model 5 with
UUU codon is energetically more favorable than model 6 lacking wybutosine
and with UUU codon. The energy difference of models 1 and 5, for
recognition of UUC codons over UUU, is +4.789 kcal/mol. This also
supports the observation of RMSD, RMSF, and base stacking analysis
that tRNAPhe prefers recognition of UUC over UUU codons
in the presence of wybutosine as per earlier reports.28 Binding energies for models 7 and 8 were also determined
to understand the effect of Mg2+ ions on tRNAPhe function. The average binding energy for model 7 was found to be
−19.788 kcal/mol and that for model 8 was −13.631 kcal/mol.
Comparing these values of binding energy for models 7 and 8 with those
for models 1 and 5, respectively, we can say that the absence of Mg2+ in the case of models 7 and 8 has a small energetic stabilizing
effect on recognition of both the codons. Thus, it is evident that
wybutosine essentially determines the energetic feasibility for binding
of tRNA to UUC/UUU codons.

2.6 Effect of Mg2+ Ions on the Structure
of tRNA
In this study, we have observed that the presence
of Mg2+ ions in models 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 does not contribute
to tRNA stability. Instead, from RMSD, RMSF, and binding energy calculations,
it can be seen that the absence of Mg2+ has been found
to be more favorable for the stability of the system. A previous study
reported that Mg2+ ions are the stabilizing factors for
the tRNA structure,49 whereas another study
reported stability of the tRNA structure even in the absence of Mg2+.47 Ghosh and Ghosh in 1972 investigated
the effect of removal of WBG in codon recognition. They found that
the concentration of Mg2+ ions influenced the structure
and thereby the function of tRNAPhe in recognizing UUC/UUU
codons. Hence, we have simulated another two systems (models 7 and
8) in the absence of Mg2+ ions to understand the preference
of codon recognition. Here, models 1, 2, 7 and 5, 6, 8 can be compared
for UUC and UUU codons, respectively. In both the groups, we can see
that the absence of Mg2+ in model 7 induces smaller RMS
deviations as compared to models 1 and 2 (Figure 2). However, in the case of model 8, the RMSD
is higher than that of models 5 and 6 (Figure 4). This behavior can be the result of changes
in the composition of the respective systems. It has been reported
that Mg2+ ions are key players during attachment of tRNA
to A/P sites of the ribosome.50

2.7 Effect of Codon Binding on the Structure of
tRNA
It has been documented previously that binding of codon
to a tRNA induces certain conformational changes,49,51 which are crucial to the energetics of the whole system. In the
present study, this effect was investigated using a control system
(model 3), which consisted of a system similar to models 1, 2, 5,
6, 7, and 8 except for the codons and Mg2+ ions. Comparative
RMSD and RMSF plots, along with structural comparisons (Figures 1, 5, and 12), show that codon binding definitely
induces structural and conformational changes in the core domains
of the tRNA molecule. Structural comparisons show some notable changes
near the wybutosine base at the 37th position and also
near the acceptor arm region. According to the visualization, we can
say that the native structure of tRNA is conserved only in the case
of models 1 and 5, while models 2 and 6 show some deformities at the
loop structures and acceptor arms (Figure 5). These structural changes will be of great
interest in the context of peptidyl transferase enzyme, which helps
in recognizing the tRNA molecule in the P-site and transferring the
respective amino acid to the growing peptide chain.

2.8 Effect of the Presence and Absence of Wybutosine
on the tRNA Structure and Codon–Anticodon Interactions
In this study, the contribution of wybutosine to the structural changes
in tRNA was investigated. Structural comparisons (Figure 5) show that in the absence
of wybutosine, as in the case of models 2 and 6, tRNA adopts some
structural changes in its ribose-phosphate backbone, especially near
the anticodon stem loop, D-loop, and near the acceptor arm (Figures 1 and 5). Remarkably, such distortions are not observed in the presence
of wybutosine. These minute conformational changes cause other bases
to change their native base-pairing geometry, as can be clearly seen
from Figure 16a,b.
Similarly, a change in the backbone of the base stacking pair along
with its interactions near the acceptor arm in the absence of WBG
is very crucial, as it might hamper the polymerization of the protein
molecule being synthesized.

base pair from various
models.

3 Conclusions
Structural aspects of the whole tRNA were investigated using fully
solvated multiple molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on eight model
systems of yeast tRNAPhe. The effect of Mg2+ on the tRNA tertiary structure is worth considering in the context
of ribosomes, as there are few reports that shed some light on its
interactions with ribosomal residues. Otherwise, the presence of Mg2+ in the native state of tRNA may result in some structural
deformities. Transfer RNA phenylalanine prefers the UUC codon over
UUU because of its energetics in the presence of wybutosine. The highly
hydrophobic WBG restricts the anticodon loop structure and maintains
it in the open-loop conformation, which allows easy access to the
UUC codon for Watson–Crick pairing during the codon recognition
process. In contrast, UUU codon recognition is less favored in the
presence of wybutosine at the 37th position (Figure 17). The presence
of a hydrophobic wyosine side chain does not allow formation of Watson–Crick
pairing within the UUU codon and anticodon, thus avoiding translational
frame shifts. Thus, the codon recognition results revealed that the
presence or absence of WBG has a determining effect on the preference
of codon recognition.

4 Computational Methods
4.1 System Nomenclature
Referring to
3D coordinates from the crystal structure of the whole tRNA34 from yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) (RCSB PDB ID: 1EHZ), totally eight tRNAPhe model systems were constructed
(Table 2) for the study
as follows.

These model systems
were built using commercially available SYBYL
ver 7.3 [SYBYL] and UCSF Chimera.35 Codon
trinucleotide segments were manually docked to tRNA by holding proper
alignment and distance for each hydrogen bond.16,23 Each of these systems was then subjected to MD simulations.

4.2 Molecular Dynamics Simulations
MD
simulations were performed by taking the initial coordinates from
model systems as mentioned above. Parameters for the modified nucleosides
occurring in tRNAPhe were retrieved from the AMBER parameter
database maintained by the Bryce group (http://research.bmh.manchester.ac.uk/bryce/amber). The solvated system was neutralized by 74 Na+ counterions.
The water density of the rectilinear box was maintained at 1.0. All
simulations were run under periodic boundary conditions with the particle-mesh
Ewald method for calculating long-range interactions.36 MD trajectories were recorded at a 2 fs time step using
the SHAKE algorithm37 for hydrogen atoms
with a nonbonded cutoff of 9 Å. The Berendsen coupling algorithm38 with 2 fs was used to calculate the trajectories
by maintaining constant pressure (1 atm) and temperature (300 K).

The equilibration protocol consisted of 4 steps of MD and 2 steps
of energy minimization. Initially, 10 000 steps of the steepest
descent method were used to minimize steric clashes between atoms.
This system was then subjected to four steps of equilibration MDs
as per our earlier studies.13,17 A final minimization
with 10 000 steps of the steepest descent method was then used
to remove any steric clashes between the atoms. These equilibrated
model systems were further used for production MD simulations of 50
ns using constant temperature and pressure. All MD simulation experiments
were performed on IBM-HS22 and HP-Proliant DL 180-G6 rack servers
using the AMBER10 software suite.39

4.3 Data Analysis
The data generated
from MD simulations were analyzed using the CPPTRAJ40 module of AmberTools16.41 Snapshots
and average structures were generated by clustering the data over
a selected time period using CPPTRAJ and UCSF Chimera.35 Postprocessing of trajectories was done to evaluate
the binding energies of the codons and anticodons using the MM-PBSA
method41 for calculating binding energies
between the codon–anticodon complexes. For graphical and statistical
representations of the results, SigmaPlot ver 10 was used.
