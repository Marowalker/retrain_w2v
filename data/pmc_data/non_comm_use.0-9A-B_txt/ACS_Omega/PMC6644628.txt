A series of supported alkali metal salts
were investigated as catalysts to produce propylene oxide (PO) from
biomass-derived 1,2-propanediol via dehydrative epoxidation in a solid–gas
reaction system. The effects of supports, cations, and anions in the
alkali metal salts and calcination temperature were investigated by
X-ray diffraction and CO2-temperature-programmed desorption.
The results indicate the catalysts with relative mild basicity having
higher yields of PO. The highest yield of PO is 58.2% from reactions
at 400 °C at an atmospheric pressure over KNO3/SiO2. In addition, the catalyst could be reused after calcination
in air at 550 °C.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Propylene oxide (PO) is an important fine chemical
which has been widely used in manufacturing of various products, including
polyurethanes, unsaturated resins, and surfactants.1 Currently, PO is mainly produced from petrochemical propylene
via two traditional routes, namely the chlorohydrin and Halcon processes.2,3

In the chlorohydrin process (Scheme 1), propylene is first reacted with a chlorine
aqueous solution in which HCl and HOCl are in equilibrium to form
a mixture of α- and β-chlorohydrin. Then, without intermediate
separation, the chlorohydrin is dehydrochlorinated with excess aqueous
Ca(OH)2 to form PO along with byproducts such as dichloropropane
and CaCl2.4 Even though the
overall selectivity is high (87–90%) by this route, the serious
equipment corrosion and environment pollution caused by the byproducts
necessitate the search for greener processes.

Scheme 1 PO from the Chlorohydrin Process
The Halcon process
(Scheme 2) is an indirect
oxidation process which normally utilizes tert-butyl
or ethylbenzene hydroperoxides as an oxidant to epoxidize propylene.
However, byproducts (tert-butanol and acetone from tert-butyl; 1-phenylethanol and acetophenone from ethylbenzene)
are also produced during this process.

Scheme 2 PO from the Halcon Process
Recently, to decrease
the formation of byproducts during the oxidation process, researchers
greatly improved the catalytic performance of titanium silicalite
(TS-1) by using novel synthetic technique.5 With the help of the TS-1 catalyst, propylene can be converted into
PO using H2O2, with H2O as the only
significant byproduct in the process. This process has attracted significant
attention from the chemical industry because of the environmental
benefit. Dow and BASF have announced the construction of the first
commercial PO plant using this technology.1

However, all of the aforementioned production processes are
strongly based on petroleum-derived propylene. Both academia and chemical
industry have shown great interests in producing PO from renewable
resources. During the last decade, the rapid development of the biomass-based
chemical industry offers plenty of chances for people to introduce
new production methods from renewable chemical intermediates.6 Because PO is a C3 compound, production
of PO from other C3 structured biomass-derived molecules
is reasonable and applicable. In this regard, bio-based 1,2-propanediol
(1,2-PDO) is a suitable candidate because the vicinal diols in 1,2-PDO
can be converted into epoxide via dehydration. Moreover, 1,2-PDO can
be easily obtained from bio-based glycerol and other kinds of C5/C6
sugars via hydrogenolysis, which has already been well-studied7 and industrialized by BASF, ADM, and S2G companies.8 The catalytic hydration of 1,2-PDO into PO has
received less study and become more difficult because of the high
reactivity of PO, which can easily react with coproduced H2O during the reaction. Fouquet et al.9 claimed a technology for the preparation of PO from 1,2-PDO diesters
via pyrolysis reaction. However, the low PO yield (only 15.6%) and
severe coking problems hindered the further development of this method.
Liu et al.6,10 reported a method of catalytic transformation
of 1,2-PDO into PO using potassium nitrate-loaded silica catalyst.
However, the highest yield is only 30.8%, and the detailed relationship
between the selectivity of PO and surface properties of the catalyst
was not fully studied. Yi et al.11 studied
gas-phase dehydration of 1,2-PDO into PO over Cs/SiO2 catalyst
and illustrated that the strong basic sites formed by Cs+ and the interaction between SiO2 and Cs+ dominated
the reaction process. Still, the yield for PO needs to be further
improved.

To better understand the relationship between the
basicity on the surface of catalysts and the selectivity for target
product PO, in this work, we systematically studied the effects of
support material, cation/anion pair in the alkali metal salt, and
calcination temperature on the basicity of the catalyst. Moreover,
the stability of catalysts during the reaction process and regeneration
process was also studied.

2 Results and Discussions
2.1 Effect of Anion Types of Potassium-Based (K-Based) Salts
Table 1 shows the
effects of various anions of K-based salts on the catalytic conversion
of 1,2-PDO and selectivity of the products. Compared with other K-based
salts, KNO3/SiO2 showed the highest activity
and selectivity for the target product. The catalytic dehydrative
epoxidation of vicinal diols is a base-promoted reaction,11 and the basicity of catalysts will significantly
affect the reaction process.12−15 Therefore, detailed basicity
conditions on the surface for each catalyst used in Table 1 were investigated by CO2-temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) method, and the results
are shown in Figure 1 and Table 2.

SiO2.

Theoretically, the surface electronic properties of the SiO2-supported catalysts are influenced by the anion types. As shown
in Figure 1, K3PO4/SiO2 exhibited CO2-desorption
peaks at lower temperatures (<110 °C), which indicated the
weak basic sites on the surfaces of these catalysts compared with
KNO3/SiO2. KNO2/SiO2 and
K2CO3/SiO2, besides having similar
CO2-desorption peaks around 110 °C, showed desorption
peaks in the range of 160–220 °C corresponding to the
much stronger basic sites on their surfaces compared with KNO3/SiO2. Also, from the perspective of basic sites
on the surface of catalysts, although the KNO3/SiO2 did not hold the highest basic sites compared with other
candidates, both the reaction rate and the selectivity were much better.
Because the basicity of catalyst is the key factor for base-promoted
reactions, the basicity of catalyst affects the reaction rate and
reaction selectivity significantly.10 Taking
both the reaction results and the basicity of K-based catalysts into
consideration, neither the weaker nor stronger basicity generated
by the anions other than NO3–1 favors
the production of PO. The reaction occurred effectively only under
the moderate basicity generated from NO3–1.

2.2 Catalytic Effects
of Different Metal Ions of Alkali Nitrate Catalysts
Table 3 shows the catalytic
effects of different alkali nitrates on 1,2-PDO conversion. KNO3/SiO2 appears the best candidate for this reaction
in terms of conversion of 1,2-PDO and selectivity of PO. To better
understand the relationship between surficial basicity and reaction
performance, the CO2-TPD profiles of these SiO2-supported alkali nitrate catalysts were further studied (Figure 2 and Table 4).

nitrates

It is obvious that
the base strength of SiO2-supported alkali nitrate catalysts
increased with the increase of molecular weight of metal cations from
LiNO3 to CsNO3, whereas the basic sites reached
the maximum in the case of KNO3/SiO2 which possibly
because of the large radius of Cs+ affected the dispersion
of CsNO3 on the surface of SiO2. Because the
reaction rate significantly relied on the surface basicity of catalysts,
the conversion of 1,2-PDO increased along with the increase of basicity.
On the contrary, even though the basicity of CsNO3/SiO2 was stronger than KNO3/SiO2, the server
coking on the surface of CsNO3/SiO2 depressed
the conversion of 1,2-PDO during the reaction process (the image of
coked catalyst is shown in Figure S12).

2.3 Influence of Support
Type
Besides the nature of the cation and anion of the alkali
metal salt catalysts, the properties of supports also played critical
roles during the reaction process. In Table 5, it is noted that the acidic/basic properties
of the supports greatly affected the reaction rate and selectivity.
To clarify the influence of support material, the bare supports were
tested under the reaction conditions. The results indicated that the
supports alone did not promote the formation of PO. Instead, the formations
of acetol and allyl alcohol were more favorable in the presence of
CaO and MgO, whereas in the case of γ-Al2O3, propionaldehyde and acetone were the main products. In the case
of SiO2, the conversion of 1,2-PDO was only 1.8%. This
is probably because of the neutral property of SiO2 because
dehydration of 1,2-PDO is a typical kind of acid–base-promoted
reaction. KNO3/SiO2 exhibited the highest selectivity
for producing PO, indicating that KNO3 is the primary component
in catalyzing the formation of PO. In other cases, the KNO3 only slightly altered the reaction direction and support surface
properties still dominated the reaction process. Taking both reactivity
and selectivity into consideration, the neutral SiO2 is
the best support for this reaction.

2.4 Effect of Calcination Temperature
The effect
of calcination temperature during the catalyst preparation was investigated,
and the results are listed in Table 6. In Table 6, it is clear that the calcination temperature greatly influenced
both the reaction activity and the selectivity toward PO. The conversion
of 1,2-PDO and selectivity for PO increased with increasing calcination
temperature from 400 to 550 °C. When calcination temperature
reached to 600 °C, the conversion of 1,2-PDO decreased dramatically
to 37.0% and the selectivity for PO rolled back to 60.4%. To better
understand this phenomenon, several characterization methods such
as X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption–desorption
analysis, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and CO2-TPD
were used to identify changes of physical structure, thermal stability,
and surface properties of KNO3/SiO2 under different
calcination temperatures.

a Reaction conditions:
400 °C; 1 atm; N2 space velocity: 15 min–1; 1,2-PDO injection rate: 3.6 mL/h; and reaction time: 1 h.

In Figure 3, the XRD patterns of KNO3 were
largely retained when the calcination temperature changed from 400
to 550 °C. However, when calcination temperature exceed 600 °C,
the characteristic peaks of KNO3 disappeared completely.
This indicated both of the crystal structure, and the physical properties
of KNO3/SiO2 were strongly related to the calcination
process. In Figure 4, the TGA curve of KNO3/SiO2 indicated that
the supported KNO3 started to decompose when the calcination
temperature was over 400 °C and greatly decomposed at around
560 °C which is in accordance with the change of XRD patterns.
Because the decomposition of supported KNO3 will certainly
affect the porous structure of catalysts and its corresponding catalytic
performance, the N2 adsorption–desorption analysis
was carried out and the results were shown in Table 7. In Table 7, with the increase of calcination temperature, both
the surface area and the pore volume decreased which means the supported
KNO3 nanocrystals would aggregate and block the pores within
SiO2.

550	40.5168	0.064598	
600	31.4878	0.040925	
Additionally, because of the heterogeneous
reaction always happening on the surface of catalyst, the surface
properties are crucial for the overall reaction trend. The CO2-TPD profiles (Figure 5 and Table 8) further illustrated the change of surface basic property of KNO3/SiO2 under different calcination temperatures.

calcination temperatures.

600	4.23	
In Figure 5, the
KNO3/SiO2 calcinated between 400 and 500 °C
exhibited similar desorption peaks, which remained almost unchanged.
Although the catalyst calcinated at 550 °C or higher temperatures,
the desorption peaks at the lower temperature red-shifted and the
desorption peaks at 225 °C disappeared. On the other hand, although
the total basic sites on the surface of KNO3/SiO2 decreased along with the increase of calcination temperature (Table 8), the KNO3/SiO2 prepared at 550 °C still exhibited the highest
conversion and selectivity of PO. Because the intensity and position
of CO2 desorption peaks are strongly related to the surface
basic properties, which also dominated the reaction process. This
suggests that the weak basic sites corresponding to the CO2 desorption peak at ∼105 °C are more favorable for the
formation of PO. The slight change of basicity (CO2-desorption
peak from 125 to 105 °C) would significantly affect the reaction
process and selectivity of the target product.

2.5 Effect of Reaction Temperature
In Table 9, the reactivity and
selectivity for PO increased with a reaction temperature up to 400
°C, and then it started to decrease when the reaction temperature
is increased to 450 °C. When the reaction time was extended to
2 h at 400 °C, both the reactivity and the selectivity for PO
sharply dropped because of coking on the surface of the catalyst.
To solve this problem, we tried to introduce 10 wt % water vapor into
the reaction system, as shown in Table 9. However, there was no PO formed under that circumstance,
probably because of the higher reactivity of the produced PO reacting
with water under such harsh reaction conditions.

Further investigation
of the coking problem on the surface of coked catalyst was performed
by TGA. In Figure 6, there are four main peaks in the differential thermogravimetry
curve of a coked catalyst. Because the decomposition temperature of
KNO3 is around 550 °C,16 the peaks below 500 °C are likely because of the decomposition
of the coked substrate. This means the coked catalysts can be regenerated
at 500 °C under air atmosphere. The catalytic performance of
the regenerated catalyst is shown in Table 10.

In Table 10, it is noted that after three times recycling,
the catalytic activity of catalyst and the selectivity for PO exhibited
some moderate decreases, but the latter still remained at a relatively
high level. Therefore, this catalytic process could be more practical
by coupling with a regeneration system which maintains the reaction
processing continuously.

3 Conclusions
In this article, a novel catalytic system
for producing PO from bio-based 1,2-PDO has been investigated. Several
types of alkali metal salt catalysts were evaluated. Support type,
cation/anion pair in the alkali metal salt, and calcination temperature
greatly affected surface properties of the catalysts, which, in turn,
dominated the conversion process and selectivity. The moderate strength
of basic sites favored the reaction conversion and selectivity to
PO. The highest yield of PO was 58.2% under 400 °C at atmosphere
pressure over KNO3/SiO2, and the catalyst could
be reused several times after being calcinated at 500 °C with
air.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Preparation of Supported
Alkali Metal Catalysts
The supported alkali metal catalysts
were prepared by the impregnation method. Typically, the porous support
was impregnated in a nitrate solution of alkali metal (alkali metal
= Li, Na, K, or Cs) at ambient temperature while stirring for 4 h.
After that, the resulting precursor of the supported catalyst was
dried at 120 °C overnight and then calcinated at 550 °C
for 6 h. The supporting ratio of alkali metal on the surface of support
is 1.5 mmol/g.

4.2 Reactivity
Tests
A fixed-bed quartz reactor was used to evaluate the
catalytic performance of the catalyst for the dehydration of 1,2-PDO
into PO. Temperature was measured by a K-type thermocouple and was
controlled with an external electrical furnace. The reaction was performed
using a 0.3 g of catalyst sample diluted with SiC (1:1 mass ratio)
which greatly disperses the reaction heating. 1,2-PDO was injected
at a rate of 3.6 mL/h into a preheating zone which was maintained
at 473 K and connected to the top of the reactor at a N2 space velocity of 15 min–1. The product was collected
hourly, and acetonitrile was used as an external standard for quantification.

The products were analyzed using a gas chromatography (GC)/GC–mass
spectrometry (MS) (Agilent 6890) equipped with a flame ionization
detector and DB-WAX capillary column, and the oven temperature ramp
was set at 333 K for 2 min and then increased to 553 K at a rate of
10 K/min. The data acquired at 1 h of the reaction time were used
to compare the catalytic activity of the catalysts. All of the experimental
data were the average values for three times experimental runs.

4.3 Characterization of
Catalysts
The XRD patterns were measured by a Rigaku D-max
2500-PC powder X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (1.5406
Å) in an operating mode of 50 kV and 100 mA.

TPD of CO2 was carried out using Micromeritics AutoChem II chemisorption
analyzer. Prior to the analysis, 0.2 g of sample was heated at 673
K for 1 h under a He flow to remove adsorbed impurities. After cooling
to 323 K, the sample was saturated with a probe gas by a flow of 10.2%
CO2/He. The physisorbed probe gas was removed by flushing
of He flow at 373 K. After the sample was cooled to 323 K and the
thermal conductivity detector signal was stabilized, the signal was
recorded with increasing temperature from 323 to 823 K at a rate of
10 K/min under the flow of He.

Thermal stability was measured
using a thermogravimetric analyzer, and the sample (∼10 mg)
was scanned from 50 to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 K/min under
nitrogen or oxygen atmosphere.

N2 adsorption–desorption
analysis was carried out using a Micromeritics ASAP-2010 instrument.
The total surface area of the samples was calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method (P/P0 =
0.1–0.2). The pore volume and pore size distributions were
obtained from the desorption branches of the isotherms using Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
methods.
