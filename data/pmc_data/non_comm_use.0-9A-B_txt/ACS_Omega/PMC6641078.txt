lα-Aspartic acid (Asp)
residues in proteins are
nonenzymatically isomerized to abnormal lβ-, dα-, and dβ-Asp isomers under physiological conditions.
Such an isomerization of Asp residues is considered to be a trigger
of protein denaturation because it either elongates the main chain
or induces a different orientation of the side chain within the protein
structure or both. However, previous studies have found no direct
evidence of the effects of Asp isomers on protein function. Therefore,
the production of Asp-isomer-containing proteins is required to verify
the effects of Asp isomerization. Here, we describe the production
of an Asp-isomer-containing protein using the expressed protein ligation.
As a model protein, bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A (RNase A, EC
3.1.27.5), which catalyzes the cleavage of phosphodiester bonds in
RNA, was used. In this study, lα-Asp at position 121
in RNase A was replaced by lβ-, dα-,
and dβ-Asp. The objective aspartic acid at position
121 is located near the active site and related to RNA cleavage. The
RNase A with lα-Asp at position 121 showed a normal
activity. By contrast, the catalytic activity of lβ-, dα-, and dβ-Asp-containing RNase A was
markedly decreased. This study represents the first synthesis and
analysis of a protein containing four different Asp isomers.

Introduction
All amino acids except
glycine have two enantiomers: l-amino acid and d-amino acid. l-Amino acid has
been assumed to be an exclusive constituent of proteins in nature.
However, recent studies have demonstrated the presence of many d-amino acid-containing proteins in various aged tissues, such
as eye lens, brain, and skin.1−5 Above all, the d-aspartic acid (Asp) residue is considered
to be associated with age-related disorders because many d-Asp residues have been found to accumulate in aged proteins as compared
with other amino acid residues. Commonly, Asp residues in proteins
are of the lα form; however, lα-Asp
residues in proteins can be nonenzymatically isomerized to abnormal lβ-, dα-, and dβ-Asp isomers
under physiological conditions via the formation of a succinimidyl
intermediate over time, as shown in Figure 1(6) Isomerization
of Asp is considered to be a trigger of protein denaturation as it
induces elongation of the main chain and a different orientation of
the side chain within the protein structure.

Figure 1 Isomerization pathways
of aspartic acid via succinimidyl intermediates.

Aki et al. studied the kinetics of isomerization of Asp residues
in peptides, predicting that >60% of lα-Asp will
isomerize
to the lβ-Asp form within a few years in metabolically
inert tissues.7 Therefore, isomerization
of Asp residues is considered to be related to not only age-related
disorders but also a wide range of protein-degenerative diseases,
such as prion diseases. An analysis of changes in protein function
due to isomerization of Asp is thus required.

Protein expression
using recombinant DNA technology is the principal
method of producing a target protein. Although it is the most frequently
used approach, it is unable to produce d-Asp-containing proteins
because this Asp isomer is a noncoded amino acid. In addition, although
chemical synthesis is able to introduce Asp isomers into a peptide
chain, the synthesis of a large polypeptide with more than 50 amino
acid residues is technically difficult. It is also very difficult
to extract the d-Asp-containing protein from aged tissue
because of the very small amounts of these proteins. Given the above
background, methods for the preparation of Asp isomer-containing protein
are limited. Here, to overcome these limitations, we have focused
on a combination of native chemical ligation (NCL) and chemical peptide
synthesis to create an Asp-isomer-containing protein and evaluated
the effect of Asp isomerization on this protein.

NCL, a coupling
reaction that produces an amide bond between the
thiol of an N-terminal cysteine (Cys) residue in one peptide and a
C-terminal thioester in another peptide, was developed by Dawson et
al.,8 which can be combined with expressed
protein ligation (EPL), where the C-terminal thioester is produced
by recombinant DNA technology. On the basis of these ligation reactions,
several proteins have been synthesized.9−13 However, EPL is restricted to the synthesis of proteins
containing Asp isomers because the cysteine residue must be located
near the N- or C-terminus and the isomerization site of the Asp residue
needs to be located outside this cysteine. Therefore, as an initial
step to clarify the effect of Asp isomerization on protein function,
we carried out a study on bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A (RNase
A, EC 3.1.27.5), which has a native Asp residue that is amenable to
EPL.

RNase A is a small monomeric protein composed of 124 amino
acids
with a molecular mass of 13 690. The three-dimensional structure
of RNase A is fully defined by its amino acid sequence.14,15 Therefore, RNase A has been used extensively as a model protein
to clarify structure–activity relationships, as summarized
by Raines.16 The active site of RNase A
has been clearly defined: two histidine (His12 and His119) and one
lysine (Lys41) are the most important amino acids for the activity
of RNase A. Structural analyses show that Asp121 forms a hydrogen
bond with His119 during RNA cleavage by RNase A.17,18 In a site-directed mutagenesis study, where Asp121 was replaced
by a glutamate residue (D121E), the catalytic activity of D121E decreased
to 17% compared to that of wild-type RNase A. Furthermore, Asp121
is located near the C-terminus, and Cys110 is located on the inside
of Asp12119 (Figure 2). Hence, Asp121 of RNase A is well positioned
for isomer replacement via EPL.

Figure 2 Structure of bovine pancreas ribonuclease
A (EC3.1.27.5). The positions
of Asp121 and Cys110 are shown in red and blue, respectively.

In this study, Asp121 of RNase
A was replaced by three abnormal
Asp isomers using EPL. The large segment of RNase A (residues 1–109)
with a C-terminal thioester was expressed by the recombinant DNA technology.
The short segment of RNase A corresponding to residues 110–124
with an N-terminal Cys residue was synthesized by the solid-phase
peptide synthesis method, in which Asp121 was replaced by each of
the Asp isomers. After their preparation, the large segment of RNase
A was ligated to the short segment containing lα-Asp, lβ-Asp, dα-Asp, or dβ-Asp
to form lα-RNase A, lβ-RNase A, dα-RNase A, and dβ-RNase A, respectively
(Figure 3). The catalytic
activities of different Asp-isomer-containing RNase A enzymes were
then compared.

Figure 3 Overview of the synthesis of RNase A by EPL.

In the present study, we report the novel preparation
of a protein
with each Asp isomer incorporated at a specific site coupled with
an investigation of the function of the resultant variant proteins.
The results clearly show that Asp isomerization affects the protein
function.

Results
Synthesis of Asp-Isomer-Containing RNase
A by EPL
In
this study, we synthesized an Asp-isomer-containing RNase A using
EPL. The progression of the ligation reaction between the large segment
and the short segment was monitored by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis using 15% polyacrylamide gels. Figure 4 shows the electrophoretogram
of the large segment of RNase A (1–109) (lane 2), after the
cleavage of intein (lane 3), and after the ligation of the short segment
of RNase A (110–124) containing lα-, lβ-, dα-, and dβ-Asp at position
121 in lanes 4–7, respectively. Lane 3 indicates that intein
was cleaved by 2-mercaptoethane sulfonate (MESNA) from RNase A (1–109),
whereas lanes 4–7 indicate that the short segment of RNase
A (110–124) was connected to the large segment of RNase A (1–109).
The ligation efficiency did not differ among the different types of
Asp isomer. After ligation, the His-tag was removed from RNase A (1–124)
using factor Xa. About 50% of the His-tag was removed from lα-RNase A over a reaction time of 20 h (Figure 5a). Figure 5b shows the four isomeric RNases after removal of the
His-tag by factor Xa. The four RNases, which still contained His-tag,
were purified by ion-exchange chromatography using a cation-exchange
column (TOYOPERL CM-650M; Tosoh Bioscience, Japan) (Figure 6). Figure 6 clearly shows the purity of the four RNases
after ion-exchange chromatography.

Differential RNase Activity Depending on Asp Isomerization
The catalytic activity of RNase A toward 2′,3′-cCMP
was measured by monitoring the increase in absorbance at 284 nm. Figure 7 shows the time course
of the activity of the RNase A variants with different Asp isomers.
The catalytic activity of lα-RNase A was at the same
level as that of commercially available RNase A (Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO). On the other hand, replacement of the lα-Asp
isomer at position 121 with lβ-, dα-,
and dβ-Asp decreased the RNase activity.

of the catalytic activities of four RNase A proteins
containing different Asp isomers.

Differential RNase Solubility Depending on Asp Isomerization
The solubility of RNase A differed depending on the type of replacement
of the Asp isomer. An aliquot of the RNase A (1–124) enzymes
containing Asp isomers was stored in a lyophilized state after dialysis
against water. Lyophilized RNase A containing lα-Asp
and dα-Asp was soluble in water at a final concentration
of 1 mg/mL. By contrast, RNase A containing lβ-Asp
and dβ-Asp showed a very low solubility in water.

Discussion
In this study, a protein containing four different
Asp isomers
was initially synthesized, and it was revealed for the first time
that isomerization of an Asp residue in the protein induced a marked
change in protein function and solubility. RNase A was selected as
an initial model protein to introduce four different Asp isomers because
(1) it is amenable to EPL and (2) it is easy to evaluate the changes
in RNase A function caused by Asp isomerization.

Our results
clearly indicated that the catalytic activity of RNase
A was completely lost by introducing abnormal Asp isomers at position
121. The loss of activity of the isomeric RNase A enzymes might be
due to the structural changes caused by introducing isomerization
at Asp121. We tried to analyze the structures of these proteins using
X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance analysis, circular
dichroism spectroscopy, and infrared spectroscopy. However, structural
information could not be obtained because of the low solubility of
the isomeric RNase A proteins. In a previous study, the RNase activity
of a D121E variant was found to decrease by approximately 83%.20 In common with gene mutation, the introduction
of Asp isomers at position 121 clearly had a large effect on enzyme
activity.

His12, His119, and Lys41 are the most important amino
acids for
the activity of RNase A. Asp121 forms a hydrogen bond with His119
during the RNA cleavage by RNase A. It is likely that the isomerization
of Asp121 made it impossible for His119 to form the hydrogen bond
that is needed for RNase activity. In addition to this functional
change, the Asp isomerization affected the solubility of RNase A.
Although Asp121 of RNase A is not isomerized in vivo, this study provides
valuable information on the functional changes that are likely to
occur in a protein due to the replacement of a single Asp isomer.

Asp isomers are often found in various metabolically inert tissues,
such as eye lens, brain, skin, bone, artery wall, and tooth.1−5 In particular, they are found in metabolically inert proteins, such
as crystallin from eye lens and β-amyloid protein from brain.21−27

In 2006, Fujii et al. demonstrated that the isomerization
of one
Asp residue in a partial peptide of αB-crystallin induced changes
in the secondary structure, hydrophobicity, and chaperone activity.28 Molecular dynamics simulation also revealed
that the inversion of l-leucine to d-leucine at
position 2 in the tetrapeptide Leu-Leu-Gly-Asp induced a change in
its three-dimensional structure.29 These
structural changes may be a trigger of protein dysfunction and insolubilization.
Indeed, our previous study supported the hypothesis that αB-crystallin
and βA3-crystallin, in which an Asp residue is inverted from
the l-form to the d-form, cannot assemble the crystallin
complex in aged human lens.30 In addition,
a large amount of Asp isomers has been found in the insoluble fraction
of human cataract lens compared to that of the soluble fraction.31

In addition, it has been reported that,
apart from isomerization,
various amino acid modifications, such as deamidation, truncation,
oxidation, and methylation, occur in human crystallin. These modifications
are also considered to be a factor in the insolubilization of human
lens.32−38

Asp isomers tend to accumulate in a metabolically inert tissue,
such as crystallin, because the isomerization of Asp undergoes an
equilibrium reaction. Therefore, the accumulation of proteins, in
which function and solubility are decreased by the isomerization of
Asp, may be a trigger of age-related diseases. It is considered that
the dysfunction of RNase A observed in this study is also related
to the denaturation of this enzyme. In terms of RNase A, isomerization
from the α-form to the β-form (epimerization) may induce
larger changes in the protein structure compared to those by the isomerization
from the l-form to the d-form (inversion) because
lyophilized RNase A containing β-Asp (lβ-
and dβ-Asp) was insoluble, whereas RNase A containing dα-Asp remained soluble. Asp121 of RNase A is located
near the C-terminus and forms a β-sheet structure through hydrogen
bonds between NH and CO groups in the main chain of the protein. Because
epimerization of an Asp residue extends the main chain of the protein,
the β-sheet structure would be broken in RNase A containing lβ- and dβ-Asp. On the other hand, the
overall structure might not be affected in RNase A containing dα-Asp. However, side-chain orientation is also important
for RNase activity because the carboxylic group of Asp121 is related
to the stabilization of the active center of RNase A. Thus, the inversion
of Asp121 is considered to affect the stabilization of the active-site
structure in RNase A. In this study, the Asp-isomer-containing RNase
A proteins showed decreased solubility, suggesting that their structures
might differ from those of lα-RNase A. lα-RNase
A was undoubtedly folded to the proper structure because its enzymatic
activity was the same as that of commercially available RNase A. This
result suggested that protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) properly folded
the chemically synthesized RNase A enzymes. On
the one hand, PDI has the ability to refold not only RNase A but also
other proteins by replacing non-native disulfides with the correct
native ones.39−41 On the other hand, the enzymatic activity of the
isomeric RNases was decreased despite using PDI. Therefore, isomerization
of Asp121 in RNase A is considered to affect the RNase activity. Even
if the isomeric RNases were misfolded, PDI might not refold them properly
because it might not recognize a protein containing an Asp isomer.
Nevertheless, although we could not determine the structure of the
isomeric RNases, Asp isomerization undoubtedly changed the behavior
of RNase. The selection of a suitable protein for analyzing the structural
changes induced by the isomerization may help us to solve this problem.
However, the isomerization of Asp is considered to be strongly related
to protein aggregation, as observed for crystallin and β-amyloid
protein. Therefore, it might be difficult to analyze the structural
changes caused by the isomerization of Asp by avoiding aggregation
of the protein.

This study demonstrated that EPL is a useful
method to construct
Asp-isomer-containing proteins. Synthesis of various proteins containing
Asp isomer using EPL would be an effective way to verify the relationship
between protein aggregation and isomerization of Asp.

Isomerization
of Asp is one of the many post-translational modifications
of proteins, including acetylation, phosphorylation, glycation, and
deamidation. Asp isomers in aged proteins are produced spontaneously
and slowly over time during the life span of an animal. Most cases
of cataract and Alzheimer’s disease develop during the aging
process regardless of the presence or absence of a genetic defect.
Indeed, a large amount of Asp isomers are found in patients with these
diseases. Therefore, it is strongly suspected that Asp isomerization
is related to the aggregation and malfunction of aged proteins. Asp
isomerization will be an important factor in age-related diseases
even if an individual is born healthy. To clarify the effect of different
Asp isomers on a protein, it is necessary to synthesize proteins containing
each of the four Asp isomers. To date, however, limitations in the
methods of protein synthesis have prevented the widespread use of
this approach. For example, recombinant DNA technology cannot introduce
Asp isomers into a protein, as the standard solid-phase peptide synthesis
cannot prepare polypeptides longer than 100 amino acids. Therefore,
EPL was used to overcome these problems in the present study. However,
other approaches will be necessary to find further information about
functional changes caused by Asp isomerization. For example, the isomerization
site of Asp in crystallin in vivo is located on the inner side of
crystallin. Thus, the synthesis of Asp-isomer-containing crystallin
protein using EPL would be difficult because the site of the Asp isomer
must be located near the N- or C-terminus and the cysteine residue
required for EPL needs to be located inside the site of the Asp isomer.
Thus, a method other than EPL is needed to synthesize crystallins
containing Asp isomers. Human secretory phospholipase A2 has been
synthesized by NCL,42 which might be applicable
to crystallins and other proteins containing Asp isomers. The synthesis
of crystallins and other proteins containing Asp isomers is a subject
for our future studies.

In summary, it has been clarified that
the introduction of Asp
isomers into a protein decreases the protein function and leads to
insolubilization. Exploring the role of d-amino acids in
proteins in an l-amino acid world opens up a new field of
protein science and will be useful to understand the mechanism underlying
the onset of age-related diseases.

Experimental Procedures
Peptide
Synthesis
The short segment of RNase A (residues
110–124; Cys-Gln-Gly-Asn-Pro-Tyr-Val-Pro-Val-His-Phe-Asp121-Ala-Ser-Val),
containing four different Asp isomers at Asp121, was synthesized by
9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl group (Fmoc)-based solid-phase peptide
synthesis using an automated solid-phase peptide synthesizer (PSSM-8;
Shimadzu, Japan). Fmoc amino acids and other coupling reagents were
purchased from Watanabe Chemical Industries, Ltd. Fmoc-l-Asp(OtBu)-OH
for use as lα-Asp was converted to Fmoc-l-Asp-OtBu-OH,
Fmoc-d-Asp(OtBu)-OH, and Fmoc-d-Asp-OtBu-OH for
use, respectively, as lβ-, dα-, and dβ-Asp. The coupling reaction was carried out by mixing
each Fmoc amino acid (10 equiv), (benzotriazol-1-yloxy)tripyrrolidinophosphonium
hexafluorophosphate (10 equiv), 1-hydroxybenzotriazole hydrate (10
equiv), and N-methylmorpholine (7.5 equiv) in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). The N-terminal
Fmoc group was deblocked with 30% piperidine in DMF. A spontaneous
cleavage of the peptide from the resin and the removal of the protective
groups were achieved by the treatment of a mixture containing 90%
trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), 5% 1,2-ethanedithiol, and 5% thioanisole
for 2 h. The crude peptides were purified by reversed-phase high-performance
liquid chromatography using a C18 column (Capcell Pak C18 ACR, 10
× 250 mm2; Shiseido, Japan) with a linear gradient
of 0–50% acetonitrile in the presence of 0.1% TFA at a flow
rate of 3.0 mL/min and detection at 230 nm.

Construction of Expression
Plasmid Containing the Intein-Fused
RNase A Gene
A complementary DNA (cDNA) of RNase A was purchased
from Open Biosystems, Inc. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out
to delete the SapI restriction site in the RNase
A gene. After mutagenesis, the cDNA of RNase A encoding amino acids
1–109 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). During
the PCR, an NdeI restriction site, His-tag, and factor
Xa site were incorporated at the 5′ end, and an SapI restriction site was added at the 3′ end of the RNase A
gene (1–109) (Figure S1). The amplified
gene was cloned into a pTXB1 vector using NdeI and SapI. The primers used in the mutagenesis and PCR are given
in Supporting Information.

Expression
of the Intein Fusion Protein
The constructed
plasmid was transformed into T7 express lysY/Iq Competent Escherichia coli (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA),
and a large segment of RNase A (1–109) was expressed. The crude
extract was purified by affinity chromatography using a Ni-sepharose
column (HisPrep FF 16/10 Column; GE Healthcare UK Ltd) with a linear
gradient of 0–250 mM imidazole in the presence of 20 mM Tris–HCl
(pH 7.4), 500 mM NaCl, and 2 M urea at a flow rate of 1 mL/min using
an AKTAprime system (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) (Figure S2).

EPL
The purified large segment of
RNase A (1–109)
dissolved in 20 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.4), 500 mM NaCl, and 2 M
urea was treated with MESNA for 20 h to cleave intein (Figure 3B). After cleavage, the short
segment of RNase A (110–124) was added to the RNase A (1–109)
solution (Figure 3C).
The resulting RNase A (1–124) fused to His-tag was purified
by affinity chromatography using a Ni-sepharose column (HisPrep FF
16/10 Column; GE Healthcare UK Ltd). After purification, the RNase
A was treated by factor Xa (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) in
50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, and 5 mM CaCl2 to cleave the His-tag (Figure 3D). The full-length RNase A was purified by ion-exchange
chromatography using a cation-exchange column (TOYOPERL CM-650M; Tosoh
Bioscience, Japan) with a linear gradient of 0–1 M NaCl in
the presence of 20 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.4) at a flow rate of 1
mL/min using an AKTAprime system (Figure 6).

Assay of RNA Cleavage Activity
The
activity of RNase
A was measured as described by Crook et al.43 In this study, 12 μg of RNase A was refolded using PDI (Takara
Bio, Japan) in the presence of 20 mM reduced l-glutathione
and 2 mM oxidized l-glutathione for 1 min at 25 °C.
After refolding, the RNase A was added to 0.1 M cytidine 2′:3′-cyclic
monophosphate (2′,3′-cCMP, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO) dissolved in 0.1 M MOPS buffer (pH 7.0). The rate of increase
in the absorbance at 284 nm was monitored by absorption spectrophotometry
(UV-2700; Shimadzu, Japan).
