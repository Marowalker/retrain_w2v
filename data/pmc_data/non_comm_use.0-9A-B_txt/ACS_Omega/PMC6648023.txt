Graphene
oxide (GO) nanoparticles have been developed for a variety
of biomedical applications as a number of different therapeutic modalities
may be added onto them. Here, we report the development and testing
of such a multifunctional GO nanoparticle platform that contains a
grafted cell-targeting functionality, active pharmaceutical ingredients,
and particulates that enable the use of magnetothermal therapy. Specifically,
we demonstrate the ability to covalently attach hyaluronic acid (HA)
onto GO, and the resultant nanoparticulates (GO-HA) exhibited low
inherent toxicity toward two different breast cancer cell lines, BT-474
and MDA-MB-231. Doxorubicin (Dox) and paclitaxel (Ptx) were successfully
loaded onto GO-HA with high and moderate efficiencies, respectively.
A GO-HA-Dox/Ptx system was significantly better than the GO-Dox/Ptx
system at specifically killing CD44-expressing MDA-MB-231 cells but
not BT-474 cells that do not express CD44. Further, modified iron
oxide nanoparticles were loaded onto the GO-HA-Dox system, enabling
the use of magnetic hyperthermia. Hyperthermia in combination with
Dox treatment through the GO-HA system showed significantly better
performance in reducing viable tumor cell numbers when compared to
the individual systems. In summary, we showcase a multifunctional
GO nanoparticle system that demonstrates improved efficacy in killing
tumor cells.

==== Body
Introduction
Graphene
oxide (GO)-based nanomaterials have shown tremendous promise
in controlled delivery of therapeutic agents.1−3 The unique physicochemical
properties of GO such as its large surface area, its ability to interact
with and adsorb hydrophobic molecules, and its relative inertness
to biological substances make it an ideal choice as a base material
for drug delivery.1,4,5 A
number of drug delivery systems utilizing GO are being developed,
and a significant majority of these systems focus on their use for
delivering chemotherapeutics.4,5 However, like many other
systems, GO-based delivery of chemotherapeutics suffers from the inability
to target specific cells in the body. This may be overcome by the
attachment of targeting moieties on GO.

A molecule that may
be used for targeted delivery of chemotherapeutics
is hyaluronic acid (HA).6 HA is a naturally
occurring polysaccharide that is present in the extracellular matrix
where it plays an important role in promoting structural integrity
of tissues and mediates cell attachment. HA is able to function in
this manner as many cell surface proteins (receptors) bind to it,
and CD44 is one such receptor, which is highly expressed on certain
types of tumor cells.7 Utilizing the CD44-binding
capacity of HA, many reports have shown the efficacy of GO modified
with HA for targeted delivery of chemotherapeutic agents.8−10 However, the GO-HA chemotherapeutic system does have its limitations.
Modified versions of these systems using molecules that enable photothermal11−14 or magnetothermal15 therapy have been
developed also, but individually, many of them do not appear to be
potent enough for killing all tumor cells.

To overcome this
issue, here, we explore the use of GO as a base
material to prepare a composite with multiple functionalities. We
hypothesized that a composite that combines numerous functionalities
into the same system is likely to be significantly better at killing
the vast majority of tumor cells. To test this hypothesis, we developed
a GO-based system that is capable of targeting specific cells (through
HA conjugation) and delivering chemotherapeutic agents (through doxorubicin
or paclitaxel loading) and may be used for magnetothermal therapy
(through addition of iron oxide nanoparticles16−19). We perform thorough chemical
characterization of the prepared nanocomposites and show their efficacy
in targeted killing of a breast cancer cell line overexpressing CD44.
Further, we demonstrate that brief exposures to AC magnetic fields
(AMF) in combination with chemotherapeutic loaded on to the nanocomposite
result in improved antitumor efficacy.

Results and Discussion
Material
Characterization
First, to confirm the syntheses
of graphene oxide (GO) and hyaluronic acid-modified GO (GO-HA), UV–visible,
X-ray diffraction (XRD), FTIR, and Raman spectroscopic analyses were
performed. UV–visible spectroscopy analyses (Figure 1A) of both GO and GO-HA show
absorbance peaks around 230 nm and a shoulder at 300 nm, which correspond
to π–π* and n–π*
transitions,20 respectively. The FTIR spectra
(Figure 1B) showing
the presence of −OH (3200–3500 cm–1), C=O (1729 cm–1), and C–O (1050–1060
cm–1) demonstrate the synthesis of GO. Additionally,
the GO-HA FTIR spectra exhibited an absence of the 1729 cm–1 peak (C=O) and a strong 1637 cm–1 peak
suggestive of an amide bond. For GO, XRD (Figure 1C) showed a shift in the peak from 26.2°
(graphite) to 9.05° and a d001 value
of 0.97 nm, indicating the incorporation of different functional groups
that resulted in exfoliation of graphite layers. GO-HA showed a slight
increase in the d-spacing value to 1.13 nm, peak shift to 7.9°,
and additional peaks in the range of 15°–30° (2θ).
Raman spectroscopic analysis of GO21 (Figure 1D) revealed the strong
absorption peaks at 1336 cm–1 (D-band) and 1584
cm–1 (G-band). Additionally, the D/G ratio was measured
to be 1.04, suggesting the introduction of disorder into the graphene
sheets as a result of oxidation, which was further increased for GO-HA.
Overall, the characterization data shows the successful synthesis
of GO, and subtle differences in the characterization data of GO-HA
when compared to GO are suggestive of the incorporation of HA onto
GO.

Figure 1 Characterizations of GO and GO-HA. (A) UV–visible spectroscopic
measurements, (B) FTIR spectroscopy, (C) X-ray diffraction analysis,
and (D) Raman spectroscopic analysis, with characteristic peaks highlighted.

To further verify the incorporation
of HA onto GO, X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) was performed. XPS analysis of GO (Figure 2) revealed significant peaks
between 284 and 289 eV (C1s spectrum) and a broad peak around 535
eV (O1s spectrum) attributed to the presence of C–C, C=C,
C–O–C, C=O, O—C=O, O=C,
O–C, and O—C=O groups.22,23 In the case of GO-HA (Figure 2), the C1s and O1s spectra showed similar peaks. In addition,
the presence of peaks in the N1s spectrum was observed, specifically
399.1 and 400.5 eV, which correspond to the secondary amine and amide
groups, respectively,24 confirming the
successful formation of an amide linkage, which would occur only if
HA was incorporated onto GO.

Figure 2 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of GO and GO-HA.
Characteristic
C1s and O1s peaks were observed in both nanoparticulates, but an N1s
peak was observed only in GO-HA, which confirms the presence of nitrogen-containing
chemical groups associated with HA.

Particulate Characterization
Next, dynamic light scattering
and atomic force microscopy were performed to characterize the size,
charge, and surface morphology of the graphene oxide particulates.
The hydrodynamic size of the particulate suspensions also provides
information on their stability in aqueous solutions. Dynamic light
scattering measurements showed that GO and GO-HA had similar hydrodynamic
diameters of 184.1 ± 33.1 and 166.8 ± 16.2 nm, respectively.
The particulates were negatively charged as would be expected for
oxides of graphene, with zeta potential values of −18 ±
3.2 mV (GO) and −21.5 ± 2.25 mV (GO-HA). Particulate sizes
as determined by atomic force microscopy (Figure 3) showed slightly lower lateral dimensions
(130–160 nm) as would be expected for dried particles. Additionally,
the calculated thickness of the graphene oxide sheets was measured
to be between 1 and 2.5 nm for both GO and GO-HA, confirming that
these were nanosized particulates. Further, transmission electron
micrographs of GO showed the exfoliated wave-like monolayer or bilayers
graphene sheets, while GO-HA exhibited a network-like geometry (Supplementary Figure 1).

Figure 3 Atomic force microscopy
of GO (top) and GO-HA (bottom). Representative
scans of GO and GO-HA are shown on the left. On the right side are
line profiles that indicate the lateral dimensions (ΔX) of the particulates (measured to be between 130 and 160
nm) and enable the calculation of thickness.

Doxorubicin (Dox) Loading and Release
Dox was loaded
onto the graphene oxide particulates by simple mixing. Based on the
aromatic character of both graphene oxide sheets and Dox, loading
was expected to occur through adsorption. Dox loading on graphene
oxide particulates was confirmed through UV–visible and FITR
spectroscopies (Supplementary Figure 2).
Loading efficiency (amount of drug loaded to the initial amount added)
was calculated to be 86.0 ± 10.7% for GO and 87.0 ± 5.6%
for GO-HA. The high loading efficiency is likely a result of the large
surface area on graphene oxides, the aromatic π–π
interaction, and possibly hydrogen bonding interaction between the
amine group on Dox and hydroxyl/carboxylic groups of graphene oxide.
In terms of weight percentage of the final complex (ratio of mass
of drug to mass of particulate + drug), the calculated amounts were
33.2 ± 2.8% for GO and 33.5 ± 1.4% for GO-HA.

To investigate
the release kinetics of the drug from graphene oxides, in vitro release
studies were performed in buffers of two different pH values: pH 7.4
(extracellular) and pH 5.5 (endosomal inside the cell). Figure 4 shows the kinetics of release
from GO and GO-HA. At physiological pH, Dox release from both GO and
GO-HA exhibited an initial burst followed by slow release over a period
of 48 h. Under conditions of lower pH (5.5), a higher burst followed
by potentially faster rates of release was observed from both particulates,
with 53 and 61% of loaded drug released over a period of 48 h. The
higher burst release in an acidic environment could possibly be due
to lowered hydrogen bonding between the amine group of DOX molecules
and the hydroxyl group of graphene oxide nanoparticles. These results
suggest that, in extracellular spaces (or in the blood), a limited
amount of drug would be released from these particulates, and a larger
portion of the drug would release only upon the intracellular uptake
of the nanoparticulates.

Figure 4 Release kinetics of Dox from nanoparticulates.
Releases from both
GO-Dox and GO-HA-Dox systems were measured in buffers of two different
pH values. Data is based on n = 3 independent release
measurements at each time point.

In Vitro Cytocompatibility
Next, intrinsic cytocompatibilities
of GO and GO-HA was investigated using two cell lines: MDA-MB-231
(a hyaluronic receptor CD44-expressing cell line) and BT-474 (cell
line with negligible expression of CD44).25 Cultures of these cell lines with nanoparticulates show that, at
low concentrations of particulates (≤25 μg/mL), live
cell numbers were close to those of control (absence of particulates)
cultures (Figure 5A,B).
At higher concentrations (100 μg/mL), both particulates were
found to result in 25–35% reduction in live cell numbers, which
could be a result of particulate-associated toxicity or due to reduced
cell growth in the presence of the particulates. In the case of the
MDA-MB-231 cell line, two-way ANOVA showed that significant differences
in cell viability are found at higher concentrations. Importantly,
significant differences were not observed between the cytocompatibilities
of GO and GO-HA (two-way ANOVA, source of variation as treatment),
suggesting that they were similarly compatible at all concentrations.
Further, at lower concentrations of particulates, the compatibilities
of particulates on both cell lines were also similar. For all further
studies, we used graphene oxide particulates at ≤10 μg/mL
concentrations.

Figure 5 Cytocompatibilities of nanoparticulates. Varying concentrations
of particulates were cultured with (A) BT-474 and (B) MDA-MB-231,
and their effect on cell viability was determined. Cell viability
measurements are normalized to control cultures of cells in the absence
of any particulates. Statistical testing was performed using two-way
ANOVA, and the results are displayed in tables adjacent to the graphs.

Cytotoxicity of Dox-Loaded
GO and GO-HA Particulates
The therapeutic efficacy of the
nanoparticulates was evaluated by
loading Dox on them and testing their ability to improve killing of
tumor cells in vitro. For these studies, Dox (in its dispersed form)
was used as a control, and equivalent amounts of Dox loaded on particulates
were tested. When tested on BT-474 cells, no differences in cell viability
were observed between GO-Dox and GO-HA-Dox (Figure 6A). However, when tested on MDA-MB-231 (CD44-expressing
cells), GO-HA was found to be significantly better at reducing the
number of viable cells when compared to GO at high concentrations
(Figure 6B). This difference
is likely due to HA conjugation, which is thought to improve the interaction
and uptake of GO-HA into cells. Another interesting aspect of the
observed result is that the targeting feature enables much higher
efficacies to specific cells. That is, while Dox is effective at killing
both cells and GO-Dox is not as effective in killing either cell type,
GO-HA-Dox is much more effective at killing CD44-expressing cells
while not as effective at killing CD44-negative cells. We suggest
that this difference could be a result of improved uptake of GO-HA
when compared to GO particulates, as shown in Supplementary Figure 3. Hence, the HA-conjugated system is
likely to be more effective on target cells and has lower side effects
on nontarget cells.

Figure 6 Cytotoxicity of Dox-loaded nanoparticulates. Varying concentrations
of Dox (either in a suspension form or on particulates) were added
to two different breast cancer cell lines, (A) BT-474 and (B) MDA-MB-231,
and their effect on cell viability was determined. Cell viability
measurements are normalized to control cultures of cells in the absence
of any Dox or particulates. Statistical analysis of data (two-way
ANOVA) was performed, and significant differences were observed, which
are reported in tables associated with the graphs.

Paclitaxel (Ptx)-Loaded System
One
of the major advantages
of the graphene oxide particulates is that they may be used as the
platform technology on which a number of features may be added. In
place of Dox (or in combination with it), another chemotherapeutic
may be used. Here, we show that Ptx may be loaded onto graphene oxide
particulates in a similar manner (Supplementary Figure 4). Loading efficiencies were measured to be 30.8 ±
9.6% for GO and 34.0 ± 11.6% for GO-HA, and weight percentages
were 23.1 ± 1.7% for GO and 28.1 ± 7.0% for GO-HA. These
Ptx-loaded graphene oxide particulates were also effective at reducing
the number of viable CD44-expressing MDA-MB-231 cells, possibly by
blocking tubulin-mediated cell division.26 Also, as observed for the Dox system, the GO-HA-Ptx nanoparticulates
were significantly better than the GO-Ptx, again suggestive of targeted
delivery (Figure 7).

Figure 7 Cytotoxicity
of Ptx-loaded nanoparticulates. Varying concentrations
of Ptx (either in a suspension form or on particulates) were added
to MDA-MB-231 cells, and their effect on cell viability was determined.
Cell viability measurements are normalized to control cultures of
cells in the absence of any Ptx or particulates. Statistical analysis
of data was performed, and significant differences were observed,
which are reported in tables associated with the graph.

Composite of Graphene Oxide and Iron Oxide
Particulates
In both drug-loaded GO-HA systems, it was observed
that the lowest
normalized cell viability was around 30%, suggesting that all tumor
cells were not killed. To improve the killing efficacy, another feature
that may be added to the graphene oxide particulates is their ability
to be used for magnetothermal therapy. Along these lines, we synthesized
iron oxide particles and loaded them onto the graphene oxide particulates
(Supplementary Figure 5). With the help
of these iron oxide particles, the temperature around the composite
particulates may be raised using magnetic fields, and such magnetothermal
therapies may be used to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapeutics
in killing tumor cells.19 The vibrating
sample magnetometer (VSM) analysis of the composite system exhibited
a small hysteresis loop (Supplementary Figure 6A) having a saturation magnetic moment (Ms) value of 46.68 emu/g. Placing our composite system
in AC magnetic fields resulted in an increase in temperature, as would
be expected (Supplementary Figure 6B).
Next, the efficacy of such a system in killing MDA-MB-231 (CD44 expressing)
tumor cells was determined by first incubating the composite particulates
with cells, followed by a brief (10 min) exposure of this entire system
to magnetic fields for 10 min, followed by incubation for 48 h. While
the magnetic hyperthermia alone resulted in a nonsignificant reduction
in the number of viable cells (Figure 8A), the combination of hyperthermia and drug (Dox loaded
on the nanoparticulates) was significantly better at reducing the
number of viable cells when compared to use of drug only (Figure 8B). These results
suggest that the GO-HA system may be effectively used to develop composites
for combination therapies, and more specifically, the combination
of targeting followed by hyperthermia along with chemotherapeutic
treatment results in significantly greater killing of tumor cells
(in this case, cells expressing CD44) with less harm to other cells
(in this case, cells not expressing CD44).

Figure 8 Cytotoxicity induced
by combination of drug treatment and hyperthermia.
GO-HA-iron oxide particulates (A) without or (B) with Dox were cultured
with MDA-MB-231 cells and exposed to magnetic fields, and cell viability
was measured. Cell viability measurements are normalized to control
cultures of cells in the absence of particulates, drugs, and hyperthermia.
Paired Student’s t-test was performed to compare
hyperthermia treatment to their respective no-heat controls. **p < 0.01.

Breakdown of Graphene Oxide Particulates
Finally, it
has been suggested that graphene oxide nanoparticulates may be degraded
in the body by immune cells.27−29 To assess if the particulates
prepared herein behave similarly, GO and GO-HA were incubated for
24 h with a macrophage cell line and then analyzed using Raman spectroscopy.
As reported by others in cultures with neutrophils or neutrophil enzymes,
a decrease in the D-band and G-band was observed in the case of RAW
cell-incubated GO and GO-HA (Supplementary Figure 7). Breakdown of GO-HA appears to be less than GO in this timeframe,
which may be due to the presence of chemical groups that affect enzymatic
activity, as suggested by Kurapati et al.30

Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrate the successful
synthesis of graphene
oxide particulates and show that they may be used as a platform for
the addition of multiple functionalities. First, we demonstrate that
hyaluronic acid may be grafted onto GO, and chemotherapeutic drugs
may be loaded onto these particles to enable killing of tumor cells.
Next, we show that the addition of a magnetothermal functionality
using iron oxide nanoparticles loaded onto the GO-HA-drug system results
in significantly improved killing efficacy when compared to systems
with only one functionality. These composite particulates with targeting,
chemotherapeutic, and magnetothermal functionalities have the potential
to be used in a number of biomedical applications, and we have showcased
one such use for killing breast cancer cells.

Experimental Section
Synthesis
of Graphene Oxide by Modified Hummers Methods
Graphene oxide
(GO) was synthesized using the modified Hummers method
followed by sonication.31 Briefly, graphite
flakes (Merck, USA), sodium nitrate, and potassium permanganate (SRL
Chemicals, Mumbai, India) were mixed at a ratio of 2:1:6 in the presence
of concentrated H2SO4 in an ice bath (at 0–5
°C). The reaction mixture was diluted by adding distilled water
under vigorous stirring followed by addition of hydrogen peroxide
(30%, v/v; Merck, India) to terminate the reaction. The resulting
mixture was centrifuged at ∼3000g for 10 min,
and the pellet was washed with 10% hydrochloric acid solution to remove
the metal ions followed by repeated washing with distilled water to
get the solution having pH 7. Purified GO was finely dispersed in
distilled water and sonicated for 2–4 h to facilitate the synthesis
of nanoparticulates.

Amination of Hyaluronic Acid
Hyaluronic
acid (HA, SRL
Chemicals, India) was reacted with ethylene diamine (EDA) to obtain
free amine groups on HA that would enable a reaction with GO. Briefly,
8.8 mg of HA (Mw = 80–100 kDa)
was first dissolved in 9 mL of 0.1 mM MES buffer at room temperature.
Then, 5 mg of EDAC·HCl and 7 mg of NHS were added to enable activation
of the carboxyl group. After 2 h of stirring, the pH of the solution
was adjusted to ∼7.3 using 0.1 N sodium hydroxide solutions,
and 20 μL of 1 mM cold EDA solution was added to initiate the
modification of HA. After 4 h of reaction, the mixture was kept for
dialysis against excess deionized water for 24 h. The prepared HA-EDA
was stored at 4 °C.

Hyaluronic Acid Functionalization of Graphene
Oxide
To incorporate HA onto the graphene oxide nanoparticulates,
the carboxyl
group of GO and amine group of HA-EDA were conjugated using the aforementioned
carbodiimide chemistry. Briefly, GO (1 mg/mL) and HA-EDA (0.1 mg/mL)
were mixed with EDC (6 mg) and NHS (6 mg) in MES buffer (0.1 M, pH
5.4) at 37 °C under constant stirring for 8 h. The obtained product
was first centrifuged at 16,000g for 10 min to collect
the hyaluronic acid-grafted graphene oxide as a pellet and washed
twice using deionized water. Finally, the redispersed solution was
dialyzed against deionized water for 48 h. The prepared GO-HA particulate
was stored at 4 °C.

Composite Preparation: Gelatin-Coated Fe3O4-Impregnated GO-HA
First, a coprecipitation
method was followed
to synthesize the iron oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticle,
where FeCl3 and FeSO4·7H2O (2:1
molar ratio) were mixed under alkaline condition (NH4OH/0.7
M NaOH). The product was centrifuged and washed twice with deionized
water to remove the impurities. Then, it was dried and stored. In
the second step, 5 mg of as-prepared Fe3O4 was
added to 10 mL of gelatin solution (1.5 mg/mL in water), and the mixture
was sonicated for 2 h. Next, it was centrifuged, and the supernatant
was stored at 37 °C. In the final step, 5 mL of prepared gelatin-Fe3O4 was added dropwise to 5 mL of 1 mg/mL GO-HA
solution and left under stirring condition at room temperature. After
12 h of incubation, the mixture was centrifuged and washed twice.
Finally, the pellet was dried and stored for further analysis.

Characterization
UV–visible spectral analysis
of GO, GO-HA, Doxorubicin (Dox, Merck), and paclitaxel (PTX, SRL Chemicals)
solutions was done on a UV–visible spectrophotometer (NanoDrop
1000, ThermoFisher Scientific) with a resolution of 1 nm. Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of GO, HA, and GO-HA nanoparticles
were recorded using a PerkinElmer FTIR spectrometer (model: L1860121,
USA), scanning from 4000 to 500 cm–1 for 42 consecutive
scans at room temperature. The hydrodynamic diameter and zeta potential
values of the nanoparticulates were measured using a Zetasizer Nano
ZS dynamic light-scattering instrument (Malvern, UK) at room temperature.
The surface morphology of the particulates was determined using an
atomic force microscope (NX-10 AFM, Park System, South Korea, along
with XEI Software for imaging) in a tapping mode at room temperature.
The interlayer spacings and diffraction patterns of graphite flakes,
graphene oxide, and hyaluronic acid-conjugated graphene oxide were
monitored using X-ray diffraction, filled with Rigaku filtered Cu
Kα radiation operated at 40 KV and 30 mA over the range of 2θ
= 5°–90°. The exfoliation of GO and GO-HA was observed
using a transmission electron microscope (Titan THEMIS, 300 KeV).
The structural order of the particulates was investigated using a
Raman microscope (532 nm laser, LabRAM HR). Elemental composition
was assessed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Al-monochromatic
radiation, 1486.6 eV, model: Kratos Axis Ultra DLD).

Drug Loading
and Release Study
To load Dox or paclitaxel
(Ptx, SRL Chemicals) onto particulates, freshly prepared 500 μM
drug solution (in DMSO) was added to 200 μL aqueous suspension
of GO or GO-HA (0.5 mg/mL) and placed on a spinning rotor (25 rpm)
at room temperature in the absence of light. After overnight incubation,
drug loaded systems were centrifuged at ∼16,900g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was washed twice in sterilized
1× PBS to remove the loosely bound drug molecules. The final
product was suspended in 200 μL 1× PBS and stored at 4
°C. The supernatant from centrifugation was collected, and the
amount of drug present was assessed [absorbance at 488 nm (Dox) and
231 nm (Ptx)] using the free drug standard curve. The drug adsorption
efficiency (AE; also loading efficiency) was determined as below  

In vitro release studies
were performed
in solutions of pH 5.5 (sodium acetate buffer) and pH 7.4 (phosphate
buffered saline) at 37 °C under shaking condition. At specified
time intervals, Dox-loaded particulates were centrifuged at 16900g for 10 min, and 160 μL of supernatant was collected
at each time point, followed by the addition of 160 μL of respective
fresh sodium acetate or PBS solution. Finally, the absorbance of the
supernatant was measured using the NanoDrop method at 488 nm, and
the percentage of the cumulative drug was calculated using the following
relation  where Ct and Ct–1 are
concentrations of the drug measured
at times t and t–1.

Cell Toxicity
Assays
The efficacy of drug-loaded nanoparticulates
and the intrinsic toxicity of the particulates without the drug were
determined by culturing these particulates with CD44– BT-474 or CD44+ MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines and
performing a standard MTT assay. For toxicity studies, both the cell
lines (5 × 103) in DMEM (10% FBS and 1% antibiotics)
were seeded in individual wells of a 96-well culture plate and incubated
at 37 °C (and in the presence of 5% CO2) for 12 h.
Varying concentrations of nanoparticulates (100–6.25 μg/mL)
were added to the cell pates, and these mixtures were incubated for
another 24 h. Finally, the culture plates were washed twice using
sterilized 1× PBS solution and incubated with 200 μL (0.5
mg/mL) of MTT solution in the dark at room temperature for 3 h. Following
the addition of DMSO, the absorbance was measured at 570 nm according
to the method described by Qin et al.32 To investigate drug (Dox or Ptx)-mediated cytotoxicity, varying
concentrations of free drug or drug-loaded particulates (equivalent
concentration of the drug) were incubated with the two different cell
lines for 48 h. Then, the individual wells were washed twice with
sterile PBS and incubated with 200 μL MTT solution (0.5 mg/mL)
in the dark at room temperature for 3 h, followed by measurement of
absorbance at 570 nm.

Hyperthermia
Magnetic hyperthermia
experiments were
performed in an EASYHEAT induction system (4.2 kW Ambrell, USA). To
measure the change in temperature, the experimental sample (with or
without magnetic nanoparticles and with or without cells) was placed
into the system and exposed to an AC magnetic field at 235 kHz under
400.5 A (RF coil current) for 10 min. Temperature change was recorded,
and if the samples contained cells, the sample was retrieved and placed
in a culture.

In Vitro Degradation of Graphene Oxide Nanomaterials
To investigate the effect of immune cells on the degradation of
graphene
oxide nanomaterials, the particulates were cultured with RAW 264.7
(macrophage) cells, and confocal Raman spectral analysis was performed
on the supernatant. For these studies, initially, cells (20 ×
103) were cultured in 96-well plates in 200 μL of
DMEM media for 12 h. Next, varying concentrations of particulates
(0.5, 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001 mg/mL) were incubated for 24 h with the
cells. The supernatant from these cultures were collected and centrifuged
at 10,000g for 10 min. The supernatant from centrifugation
was first dialyzed against MQ water for 48 h and analyzed.

Statistical
Analysis
In studies involving cells, three
independent repeats were performed for each experiment, and within
each experiment, the assays were usually performed in duplicates.
Data is reported as the mean of each independent repeat ± standard
deviations (SD). Repeated measured two-way ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni
post-hoc test was used to statistically compare data, except for the
hyperthermia studies where Student’s paired t-test was used for statistical comparisons.
