Hexagonal boron nitride
(BN), an effective diffusion material for
mass transport, was functionalized with molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and Au nanoparticles (Au NPs). Then, the working electrodes
with developed nanomaterials were applied to construct an electrochemical
paraquat sensor. BN was prepared using a solid-state synthesis method
combined with solvent-cutting. The electrochemical properties of the
BN/MoS2/Au NP-based glassy carbon electrode (GCE) were
investigated using differential pulse voltammetry and cyclic voltammetry.
An excellent response signal to paraquat was found from 0.1 to 100
μM with a limit of detection of 0.074 μM, and it had acceptable
reproducibility (relative standard deviation = 2.99%, n = 5) and good anti-interference ability. The modified GCE showed
superior performance owing to the synergistic effects among all three
given nanomaterials. With the proposed method, paraquat in grass samples
from an orchard was then investigated. The results of the electrochemical
analysis agreed with those of experiments and obtained a 96.28% confidence
level via high-performance liquid chromatography, exhibiting relatively
high stability. Therefore, the fabricated sensor can be a candidate
for the determination of paraquat.

1 Introduction
With the need to increase food production, pesticides and herbicides
have been widely used in agriculture practices.1 The past few decades have witnessed the issue of herbicide
paraquat. Paraquat dichloride is an active composition of one of the
dipyridyl compounds. With its nonselectivity and high toxicity, paraquat
is usually used against weeds,2,3 which has been a threat
to our environment, especially in developed countries.4 Therefore, monitoring paraquat residues in the environment
is of great importance. Up until now, several analytical approaches
of paraquat determination have been developed, including chromatography/mass
spectrometry,5,6 colorimetric assay,7,8 and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy.9 Nevertheless, these techniques require time-consuming sample pretreatment
and are mainly laboratory-based for bulky instruments except for the
electrochemical method.10−13 In contrast, electrochemical alternatives without
any complicated sample pretreatment are easier to operate, have higher
sensitivity, and are less expensive for a sensory platform. Nasir
developed an electrochemical detection method for paraquat using mesoporous
silica thin film modified GCEs.1 Ye prepared
polyvinyl pyrrolidone functionalized graphene and cuprous oxide to
fabricate the paraquat electrochemical sensor.12 Li used polypyrrole-grafted nitrogen-doped graphene to
modify the glassy carbon electrode (GCE) to detect paraquat.14 Thus, electrodes modified with mesoporous and
nanostructured materials emerged and have been applied in the field
of electroanalysis.

Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials have
gained an increasing interest
in nanoscience and nanotechnology.15 Boron
nitride (BN) nanosheets, with layers of sp2 bonded, have
become an excellent candidate in optoelectronic materials and sensors
owing to the particular optical and electronic properties.16 The preparation of highly thermally conductive,17 mechanically stable and thicker BN18,19 and its electrochemical application20,21 have attracted
lots of researchers’ attention. Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) consists of layered sheet morphology with S–Mo–S
covalent bonding and is stacked vertically with interplanar van der
Waals interactions. Owing to well-known semiconducting properties,
MoS2 has been applied as one of the modified GCE materials
in amperometric- and impedance-based sensors for different analytes.22 With BN and MoS2 deposited on GCE,
the enhanced mobility and carrier conductivity could allow efficient
energy transfer. Because of the special properties of 2D materials,
these composite materials have been successfully developed and studied
in many fields.

In comparison with individual 2D materials,
electrical and thermal
conductive interfaces and mechanical reinforcement can be improved
by the doping 2D materials.23 In addition,
controlling their intrinsic electronic properties is another strategy
to optimize the sensing properties of semiconductors.24 Therefore, numerous doping approaches such as defect engineering,
molecule physisorption, and chemical doping methods have aimed at
changing the materials’ charge concentrations.24,25 In particular, with metal nanoparticles (NPs), surface adatoms can
be an effective way for the combination of 2D material.25,26

Inspired by the foregoing research, scalable BN was developed
by
a solid-state reaction combined with the solvent-cutting method. MoS2 was created by liquid phase exfoliation, offering large surface
areas. Au NPs can be easily made, usually as a support for target
sensors, and thus, they enhance adsorbance.27 The BN/MoS2/Au NP nanocomposites were designed to achieve
preferable sensing performances. Herein, the self-assembled structures
were characterized and discussed. Furthermore, the paraquat electrochemical
behavior on the sensor was investigated by voltammetry. Paraquat in
grass samples can be detected according to the selected electrochemical
measurement.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of the BN/MoS2/Au NPs
The
crystal structures of BN and MoS2 were researched using
X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Bruker, Germany)
to characterize. From Figure 1A (blue), three sharp diffraction peaks (26.4°, 41.8°,
and 54.5°) representing the (002), (100), and (004) lattice planes
can been observed, indicating the well crystallized BN colloidal nanocrystals. Figure 1A (red) displays
12 distinct peaks at 14.4°, 29.1°, 32.7°, 33.5°,
35.9°, 39.6°, 44.3°, 49.9°, 56.1°, 58.4°,
50.3°, and 62.9°, respectively, confirming MoS2 synthesized, as in the literature.28−30 The Raman spectra of
BN (blue), MoS2 (red), and BN/MoS2/Au NPs (black)
have been shown in Figure 1B. It is clear that the characteristic band of BN at 1390
cm–1 corresponds to the E2g phonon mode.
Besides one prominent peak of BN, the Raman spectra of the BN/MoS2/Au NP composites have the other two main peaks at 464 and
570 cm–1, which belong to the in-plane E2g1 and out-of-plane
Ag2g1 modes
of MoS2.The result also confirms that BN and MoS2 exist in the composites.

Figure 1 (A) XRD patterns of BN (blue) and MoS2 (red). (B) Raman
spectra of BN (blue), MoS2 (red), and BN/MoS2/Au NPs (black).

To investigate the morphology
of BN and MoS2, scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) (ZEISS, Germany) and transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) (FEI, Netherlands) analyses were applied. Figure 2 displays the SEM
images of BN and MoS2; TEM mappings of BN, MoS2, Au NPs, and the hybrid composite were displayed in Figure 3. Figure 2A clearly illustrates the feature of BN with
an obvious gap and some voids visualized using SEM. The TEM image
of BN (Figure 3A) displays
clear lattice fringes, indicating a high degree of crystallinity.17Figure 2B shows the SEM image of MoS2 obtained by the up-bottom
method. Besides, the elemental composition of the BN/MoS2/Au NPs was determined (Figure S1). It
can be seen clearly the elemental mapping (B, N, Mo, S, and Au) of
the composites.

Figure 3 TEM images of (A) MoS2, (B) BN by
solvent cutting, (C)
Au NPs, and (D) BN/MoS2/Au NPs.

As seen in Figure 3B, there is a smooth surface on the MoS2 nanosheets. The
morphology of Au NPs is shown in Figure 3C. The TEM image was captured to explore
the nanostructures of BN/MoS2/Au NPs. Figure 3D shows the assembled composite
monolayers. Figure 3D shows the assembled composite monolayers with high surface coverage.
The growth on top of each other between 2D BN and 2D MoS2 is the result of the van der Waals heterostructures. Thus, MoS2 is decoupled in the lateral locations of the BN monolayer.31,32 Furthermore, Au NPs of the hybrids were decorated on the edges of
the BN and MoS2, which improves the electronic conductivity
of MoS2 and prevents MoS2 aggregation.33

2.2 Electrochemical Behaviors
of Paraquat
The electrochemical performance of paraquat was
investigated with
differential-pulse voltammetry (DPV) after the decoration of the BN/MoS2/Au NP GCE (Figure 4). With different GCEs, there are strongly different signal
reactions on their charge. The peak current at a bare GCE was lower
than the current at other modified GCEs, while the highest currents
of peak 1 (P1) and peak 2 (P2) at the BN/MoS2/Au NP electrode
were up to 10.9 and 5.1 μA, respectively. The signal according
to the Randles–Sevcik relationship can be described as eq 1 1  where ip is the
forward peak current, n is number of electrons exchanged
per molecule, A is the electrode active area (m2) (A = 0.07 cm2), D is diffusion coefficient (m2 s–1),
and C0 is the concentration of paraquat
(mol L–1). Therefore, it is clear that the improved
properties of the BN/MoS2/Au NP GCE were considerably contributed
to the increasing active area (1.8 cm2). Additionally,
peak potentials, which can be seen, are approximately −0.55
and −0.90 V (Figure 4). The other GCEs’ active areas (BN/GCE, MoS2/GCE, and Au/GCE) are 0.61, 0.31, and 0.27 cm2, respectively.
The two peak potentials are attributed to the two successive one-electron
transfers.34 The redox mechanism of paraquat
is obviously well-described as given below:

of PB (0.1 M, pH = 8.5) with paraquat (50 μM)
on nonmodified, BN, MoS2, Au NPs, and BN/MoS2/Au NP-modified GCE.

2.3 Cyclic
Voltammetric Characterization
To further understand the dynamic
performance of paraquat on the
BN/MoS2/Au NP composites, cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves
of the proposed electrochemical sensor in PB (0.1 M, pH = 8.5) containing
paraquat (50 μM) were recorded at scan rates ranging from 10
to 300 mV s–1, as shown in Figure 5A. Figure 5B shows that the redox peak current varied linearly
with the increasing of square root of the scan rate (S), suggesting a diffusion-controlled kinetic process on the BN/MoS2/Au NP-based electrode in accordance with other ref (14) The linear regression
equations are Ipa = 0.4077v1/2 + 0.2026 and Ipc = −0.492v1/2 −0.4002 with R2 = 0.9934 and 0.9902, respectively.

μM paraquat in pH 8.5 PB at a scan rate ranging from 10 to 300
mV s–1. (B) Relationship between peak currents and
square root of the scan rate.

2.4 Optimization of the Paraquat Signal on the
Modified Electrode
To obtain the optimum conditions for paraquat
analysis, main factors including the pH value of PB, the volume of
the BN/MoS2/Au NP suspension, and accumulation time were
found. Figure 6A shows
the paraquat responses detected by DPV in PB solution (0.1 M) at a
series of pH values. In addition, the P1 current at around −0.58
V is detected, and the potential of P1 is unrelated to pH, while the
P2 current at approximately −0.90 V is detected only in an
alkaline environment, and there is a weak shift in P2 in the same
condition. These phenomena can be ascribed to proton participation
in the redox reaction.12 In Figure 6B, the peak current grows as
the pH value of PB changes from 4.5 to 8.5 and then decreases when
the pH value varies from 8.5 to 9.7. Therefore, the paraquat signal
is maximal in PB (pH = 8.5), which is similar to the previous research.35 Consequently, PB, when its pH value was adjusted
to 8.5, was used in all subsequent work. Adsorption increases with
decreasing acidity because the herbicide paraquat exists in its cationic
form in water (pKa = 11).36 At lower pH, the BN/MoS2/Au NP GCE surface was
saturated with hydronium ions (H3O+); thus,
the high competition between these ions and positively charged paraquat
decreased the adsorption of paraquat. When the pH value is up to 8.5,
the peak current achieves maximum with the adsorption of paraquat
being highest. Subsequently, the current response begins to fall down
because of the maximum possible coverage of the electrode surface
with paraquat.

Figure 6 (A) Paraquat responses detected by DPV in PB solution
(0.1 M) at
a series of pH values. (B) Effect of pH on the current of paraquat
determination (50 μM) in PB (0.1 M, pH = 8.5).

The behavior on the GCE decorated with different volumes
of the
BN/MoS2/Au NP suspension was also investigated to determine
optimal values for further detection. As presented in Figure 7, the signals of P1 and P2
have nearly the same inclination. As the amount of the BN/MoS2/Au NP composite increases from 2 to 5 μL, the peak
currents also show an increase. The currents decline in the range
of 5–8 μL. Hence, 5 μL was used as the optimum
for subsequent measurements. This is attributed to the thickness of
the BN/MoS2/Au NP film covered successfully on the GCEs.
As the volume of BN/MoS2/Au NPs decorated on the GCE increased,
the adsorbed paraquat amount also increased. However, the film became
too thick with more than 5 μL of BN/MoS2/Au NP suspension-modified
GCEs, which blocked the electron transfer between the electrolyte
and the electrode. Consequently, the appropriate amount of BN/MoS2/Au NPs is 5 μL. In this way, not only the electron
transfer is fastest but also the surface area for the enhancement
of paraquat is largest. The sensitivity is thus also improved.

Figure 7 Effects of
the BN/MoS2/Au NP coating solution volumes
on the peak current of paraquat (50 μM) in PB (0.1 M, pH = 8.5).

The effects of accumulation time on the DPV response
for paraquat
under the accumulation potential of −1.4 V can be seen in Figure 8. For the solution
containing 50 μM paraquat, the P1 and P2 currents apparently
increase with concentration time until 120 s. The results confirm
that adsorption equilibrium cannot be obtained instantly. Thus, considering
the sensitivity of target analyte detection, 2 min is the best for
the lower concentration of the paraquat.

Figure 8 Effects of the accumulation
time on the peak current of paraquat
determination (50 μM) with 5 μL BN/MoS2/Au
NPs modifying GCE in PB (0.1 M, pH = 8.5).

2.5 Analytical Characterization of the BN/MoS2/Au NP-Modified Electrode
The analytical performances
of paraquat on the GCE with 5 μL BN/MoS2/Au NP modifying
were obtained in PB (0.1 M, pH = 8.5) for 2 min accumulation mentioned
above, and it can be shown that the signal of peak currents varies
with concentration (Figure 9). As seen in Figure 9, peak currents at a potential around of −0.5 V versus
Ag/AgCl are used as the calibration data, the black line represents
voltammogram for blank concentrations and a stripping response is
then observed at concentrations between 0.1 and 100 μM. Fresh
sample solutions were used for each individual concentration, and
five measurements were made for each data point. Hence, the relative
standard deviation (RSD) of P1 is 2.99%. There is a very linear behavior
between I and C, which can be shown
as the equation I = −0.4332 + 0.0857C (R2 = 0.9941). The limit of
detection (LOD) was calculated according to the reported literature.37 The LOD (3σ) of P1 is 0.074 × 10–6 mol L–1. The figures of interest
obtained using the BN/MoS2/Au NP-modified electrode and
other sensors in the reported papers for paraquat detection are listed
in Table 1. Compared
with the other electrodes, the BN/MoS2/Au NP sensor displays
a relatively low LOD.

2.6 Reproducibility,
Stability, and Interferences
To evaluate the precision of
the BN/MoS2/Au NP GCE sensor,
a series of repetitive analysis was conducted in PB with 10 μM
paraquat using five different modified electrodes under the optimal
electrochemical conditions (pH = 8.5, the volume of BN/MoS2/Au NP suspension was 5 μL, and the accumulation time was 120
s). The average RSD of 5 time measurements of the paraquat was around
3% (P1), demonstrating superior repeatability. Furthermore, given
the stability of the modified electrode, 10 modified electrodes were
stored for a month at room temperature. The peak currents of P1 and
P2 retained approximately 90 and 88%, respectively, of the original
responses, suggesting a potential for continuous operation. Different
analyses were examined considering their interference with the determination
of paraquat. Inorganic ions including K+, Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Fe3+, Cl–, SO42–, and PO43– had no influence on the
detection of paraquat. Moreover, some organic substances added into
the detection solution are listed in Table 2. The electrochemical alternative makes the
paraquat recovery between 99.4 and 102.7%, indicating relatively excellent
selectivity.

2.7 Real Sample Determination
The fabricated
sensor’s analytical utility was estimated by determining paraquat
in grass samples obtained from an orchard. The 200 μL sample
was diluted in 2 mL PB solution. The same stored samples were detected
five times in a parallel comparison to calculate the RSD. The voltammograms
for the real sample analysis are presented in Figure S2. All of the real-life samples were also determined
by HPLC. According to Table 3, the proposed method demonstrated good accuracy and reliability
with a relative error of approximately 4%.

3 Conclusions
BN was prepared using a solvent-cutting
method, and the size of
BN required customization dependent on the reaction temperature. With
MoS2 decoupled in the lateral locations of the BN monolayer,
the active area has been enhanced. With Au NPs, the electronic conductivity
has been improved and MoS2 aggregation has been prevented.
The combination of BN, MoS2, and Au NPs shows a large surface
area and facilitates electron transfer, which is used to fabricate
an efficient sensory platform for the determination of paraquat, expanding
the application of BN as an electrochemical sensor material. Therefore,
the synergy existing between BN, MoS2, and Au NPs may facilitate
electron transfer. Besides, the sensor not only has a wide linear
range with low LOD but also presents good anti-interference ability
and stability. The novel sensor based on BN/MoS2/Au NPs
can be considered as a promising candidate for the determination of
trace paraquat.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Chemicals and Apparatus
The chemicals
used are the following: some are Nafion-117 and paraquat (98%) (Sigma-Aldrich,
USA); others are boric acid (BA), melamine, cyclohexane, formaldehyde, N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP), and ethchloroauric acid tetrahydrate
(HAuCl4·4H2O) (Sinopharm group, China).
Phosphate butter (PB, 0.1 M) with pH values from 4.5 to 9.5 was prepared
with Na2HPO4 and NaH2PO4. The other chemicals used were of analytical grade.

4.2 Preparation of BN
BN colloidal nanocrystals
were synthesized following a reported article.39 Naturally, the mixture of BA and melamine (n1/n2 = 1:6) was milled with
agate mortar and pestle. The milled sample was then heated in a horizontal
tube furnace to 1000 °C (10 °C/min) and kept for 2 h with
5% H2/N2 mixed gas. The gained crude samples
were then trimmed using ethylene glycol at 40 °C for 2 h. The
final obtained powders were dialyzed for 1 week to remove melamine,
and then, stable dispersions of the BN sheets were gained.

4.3 Preparation of MoS2
A
procedure for obtaining MoS2 is as follows.28 The dispersed MoS2 nanosheet suspension
was prepared with the bulk MoS2 powders (50 mg) in 10 mL
NMP solution by sonication at 25 °C for 6 h. The MoS2 was prepared by ultrapure water rinsing and dried at 60 °C.

4.4 Preparation of Au NPs
Au NPs were
obtained by the following steps in the literature.29 Solutions of sodium citrate (1% by weight) and HAuCl4 (0.01% by weight) were prepared. Afterward, the HAuCl4 solution (0.5 mL) was added in the boiled sodium citrate
solution (48.5 mL). The mixture was then heated until the color changed
to a brilliant red. The obtained suspension was subsequently centrifuged
and concentrated to a volume of 5 mL.

4.5 Preparation
of the BN/MoS2/Au NP
Composites
MoS2 nanosheets (1.5 mg) were dispersed
in 1 mL of monodisperse Au suspension by ultrasonic treatment for
1.5 h until a black solution was formed. BN (1.5 mg) was then added
into the prepared MoS2/Au NP suspension by ultrasonication
for 1.5 h. After that, these self-assembled structures was added with
20 μL of Nafion-117 (5 wt %) to form a well-dispersed suspension,
which was kept at 4 °C.

4.6 Fabrication of BN/MoS2/Au NP Electrode
The 3 mm GCE was processed with
alumina powder (0.05 μm)
and washed using 1 M H2SO4, deionized water,
and ethanol several minutes for sonication until it was cleaned. Subsequently,
the dispersions containing BN-based hybrid structures (5 μL)
were drop-casted on the GCE surface. For comparison, others were similarly
prepared using BN, MoS2, and Au NP dispersions.

4.7 Analytical Procedure
CV and DPV were
performed using CHI 660E Instruments (China). CV and DPV were investigated
at the potential ranging from −1.2 to −0.2 V.

The grass samples with sprayed paraquat were collected from the orchard
after a week in Zhangqiao of Weinan, China. The samples were air dried
and mixed uniformly. The as-obtained samples were sieved (0.075 mm)
and thoroughly homogenized. Five grams of processed samples and 20
mL of ultrapure water were added into a centrifuge tube. The remaining
paraquat in the samples was recovered by sonication for 1 h. The supernatant
was then obtained through centrifugal separation. Each sample was
divided into two portions and kept in labeled polypropylene containers
at 5 °C before analysis.

Paraquat was determined by electrochemical
analysis and high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) (2695, Alliance, USA). The chromatographic
separation of the analytes was performed with a 25 cm length ZORBAX
Extend C18 column at 30 °C. The mobile phase consisted
of sulfonate (3.64 g), phosphoric acid (16 mL), acetonitrile (100
mL), and water (900 mL), and the pH value of the mobile phase was
adjusted to 2 with trimethylamine. The flow rate, injection volume,
and detection wavelength were 1 mL min–1, 10 μL,
and 290 nm, respectively.
