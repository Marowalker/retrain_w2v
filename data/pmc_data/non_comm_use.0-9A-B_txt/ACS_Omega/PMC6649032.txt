Flow blurring (FB) atomizers are
relatively simple yet robust devices
used for the generation of sprays from solutions of a wide range of
viscosities. In this work, we have demonstrated that FB devices may
also be applied for massive production of liquid filaments from polymeric
solutions. They can later be transformed into solid filaments and
fibers, leading to the production of so-called fiber mats. The liquid
precursors consisted of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) solutions of varying
molecular weights (105 [100k] to 4 × 106 g/mol [4M]) and concentrations. The FB device was operated in the
gas pressure range of 3–6 bar. Except for solutions of PEO
100k, all solutions exhibited a shear thinning behavior. For massive
filament production, a threshold polymer concentration (ct) was identified for each molecular weight. Below such
concentration, the atomization resulted in droplets (the classical
FB functioning mode). Such a threshold value decreased as the PEO
molecular weight increased, and it coincides with the polymer coil
overlap concentration, c*. The viscoelastic nature
of the solutions was also observed to increase with the molecular
weight. A 3.2 dependency of the zero-shear rate viscosity on a so-called Bueche
parameter was found for filament production, whereas a nearly linear
dependency was found for droplet production. In general, the mean
diameter of the filaments decreased as they traveled downstream from
the atomization point. Furthermore, at a given distance from the atomizer
outlet and gas pressure, the mean filament diameter slightly shifted
toward larger sizes with increasing PEO molecular weight. The tendency
agrees well with the calculated filaments’ Deborah number,
which increases with PEO molecular weight. The approach presented
herein describes a high-throughput and efficient method for the massive
production of viscous filaments. These may be transformed into fibers
by an on-line drying step.

1 Introduction
Liquid
filaments from polymeric solutions or melts constitute the
base for fabrication of microfiber networks, so-called fiber mats,
in various processes. These mats, and their derivatives, find a wide
range of applications as high-value fabrics, from scaffolds for biomaterials
and tissue engineering,1,2 to films for energy harvesting3 and electronic devices.4 They also serve as catalytic surfaces in the chemical industry.5,6 The generation method of the filaments affects the final characteristics
of the microstructured fiber mats, such as the diameter of the fibers
and their composition. In general, the liquid filaments are transformed
into fibers by solidification because of cooling, in the case of polymer
melts, or by solvent evaporation in the case of polymer solutions.
Processing of polymers is of interest to many areas of material science,
for instance in high-tech applications such as space technology.7,8

Common approaches for generation of micrometer-sized liquid
filaments
or jets involve electrical forces, as in electrospinning.5,9,10 In such techniques, a meniscus
of a viscous liquid, continuously emanating from a capillary tube,
is transformed into a so-called Taylor cone by the action of a sufficiently
high electric potential. At this critical potential, the cone’s
apex emits a jet that travels toward an electrically grounded electrode
positioned downstream of the capillary. More details of the electrospinning
and electrically driven liquid jets can be found elsewhere.5,11−17 Other methods use aerodynamic forces to focus a liquid stream through
an orifice, thus forming a relatively thin, uniform jet in what is
known as flow focusing (FF).18−20 In general, a three-dimensional
FF device consists of two concentric capillary tubes, where the liquid
flows in the inner capillary and a gas in the exterior one. At the
capillaries’ end, the gas surrounds the liquid stream and focuses
it to pass through a small orifice, perforated on a plate and placed
downstream of the tubes’ end, thus generating a jet. These
methods are advantageous for production of liquid jets with uniform
diameter at the expense of a relatively low throughput.

However,
in this work, we demonstrate that the so-called flow blurring
(FB) method,18 a pneumatic approach for
atomization of liquids into fine sprays, may also be used for the
massive production of liquid filaments. The FB technique has a throughput
of the order of tens of liters per hour, thus allowing mass production
of filaments at a rate many orders of magnitude larger than most common
methods. The mechanism of liquid atomization by FB was first reported
by Gañán-Calvo18 and since
then the technique has been employed by others.19,21−24 Schematics of a typical FB atomizer are shown in Figure 1a. Geometrically, an FB atomizer
is similar to an FF device, the only difference being the value of
a dimensionless parameter ϕ = H/D, where D is the diameter of the discharge orifice
and H is the gap between the tip of the liquid feeding
tube and the discharge orifice (see Figure 1a). For ϕ approximately >0.25, the
FF mode is achieved, whereas for ϕ below such value the device
operates in FB mode.18 Briefly, in an FB
device, the kinetic energy carried by a gas flow radially imploding
onto the liquid stream induces a relatively stagnant region between
the feeding tube and the outlet, thus generating a turbulent back-flow
pattern in the interior of the device, which promotes an efficient
gas–liquid interaction and simultaneously results in the breakup
of the liquid surface to form droplets. This characteristic flow constitutes
one of the main advantages of the FB method as it is responsible for
its high atomization efficiency. Indeed, FB devices generate from
five to fifty times more surface area than other methods, such as
plain-jet air-blast and effervescent atomizers.18,22,25 FB is a relatively simple yet robust method
to atomize a variety of liquids with a wide range of viscosities,
from water and ethanol (∼10–3 Pa·s),21 to vegetable oil (∼500 Pa·s).22 So far, FB has only been employed to disperse
bulk liquids into droplets, and not to produce liquid filaments from
polymer solutions. These are known to exhibit viscoelastic nature
depending on their molecular weight and concentration.

Viscoelastic liquids are fluids
that exhibit an extensional rheology,
thus varying their viscosity with time and applied strain rate.26−28 The length of the chain, that is, the molecular weight of the polymer,
is the main factor determining its rheological properties.28 It is this elastic characteristic of polymeric
solutions which leads us to think that, under the relative high stress
experienced by the liquid stream in the FB atomizer, it may exhibit
an elongational flow behavior rather than breaking up into droplets.
The work of Keshavarz and co-workers also shows the formation of short-range
ligaments during the fragmentation of dilute viscoelastic liquids.29 Some authors have reported the formation of
filaments or fibers from highly viscous liquids using air-blast type
of atomizers under certain conditions of applied pressure and temperature.
Lysak and collaborators reported the production of fibers, using a
pneumatic atomization method, from polymer melts, which requires additional
energy to heat the polymer and achieve its flowing state.30 Nevertheless, details of their atomizer and
its functioning mechanism remain largely unknown, but it can be inferred
that they used a type of air-blast atomizer. Otaigbe and McAvoy atomized
a molten stream of polyethylene using an air-blast device combining
high-pressure (>72 bar or 7.6 MPa) and temperature (∼200
°C),
and reported the formation of fibers under certain conditions.31 Li observed the formation of ligaments and filamentary
structures during air-blast atomization of relatively low molecular
weight poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and pointed out that the physical
scale of these ligaments increased with PEO molecular weight and thus
elasticity.32 Solution blow spinning (SBS)
has also been used to produce polymer fibers without the need of an
electric field.33 Daristotle and co-workers33 summarized the important parameters that govern
the SBS process and have identified a critical polymer concentration
for fiber formation, which is also shared with the electrospinning
process.

In the present work, we have used aqueous solutions
of PEO of various
molecular weights and concentrations to demonstrate the massive formation
of filaments at a critical concentration using the FB method, at room
temperature, even at distances far downstream of the atomization point.

(PEO 100k), 600 000 g/mol (PEO 600k), 1 000 000
g/mol (PEO 1M), 2 000 000 g/mol (PEO 2M), and 4 000 000
g/mol (PEO 4M) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received.
Distilled water (Milli-Q) was used as solvent. For atomization experiments,
a commercial FB atomizer (Ingeniatrics Tecnologías, Seville,
Spain) with an orifice diameter (D) of 700 μm
and a distance from the liquid capillary outlet to the orifice (H) of 100 μm was used, resulting in a ϕ of 1/7.19,21

2.2 Solution Preparation, Viscosity, and Surface
Tension Measurements
Polymeric solutions of different concentrations
were prepared by mixing the appropriate amount of PEO in distilled
water, followed by mixing with a magnetic stirrer until a uniform
solution was obtained. Generally, the final aqueous polymeric solutions
were transparent except for PEO 100k, for which a turbid liquid was
obtained, probably due to its relatively high concentration. Typical
stirring times were of the order of 1 day; in some cases, mild heating
was applied to facilitate mixing, particularly in the case of PEO
of higher molecular weight and relative high concentration. The solutions
were cooled at room temperature prior to use. Subsequently, the viscosity
was measured using a Brookfield DV-E instrument equipped with LV-type
spindles, in the shear rate range of 1–100 s–1. All measurements were performed at room temperature (19–24
°C) and ambient relative humidity (40–60%). Solutions
were allowed to stabilize for a few minutes before recording any measurement.

The surface tension of polymeric solutions in air was measured
with a KSV contact angle meter (CAM 100) set up in a pendant drop
configuration, for static measurements in the range 0°–180°.
The instrument is equipped with a FireWire video camera module with
a resolution of 640 × 480 pixels and with a light-emitting diode,
monochromatic, light source. The objective lens provided with the
camera is telecentric with a 55 mm focus length. The instrument’s
software applies a curve fitting using the Young–Laplace equation
to calculate surface tension. Only polymeric solutions with a critical
concentration were measured (as described below).

2.3 FB Atomization and High-Speed Video Recording
Figure 1b shows
the setup used for atomization experiments. The FB atomizer was mounted
on an optical table using high-precision, movable mounts (not shown
in the figure), which allowed to displace it forward and backward
along a straight center line. The atomizer was operated by controlling
the pressures of gas, air in this case, and liquid supply lines. The
air was fed into the FB atomizer directly from the supply line. The
liquid was fed pneumatically thru a hermetic aluminum liquid container
as depicted in the figure. A check valve was placed between the liquid
container and the atomizer inlet to avoid back flow. Both, gas and
liquid pressures were measured by digital manometers. For the FB atomizer
operation, first, the air pressure (Pg) was fixed in the range 3–6 bar, and then the liquid pressure
(Pl) was adjusted until a continuous,
stable atomization was achieved. Typically, Pl was ∼0.7 bar lower than Pg.

Videos of the atomization process were recorded at varying
distances, d, from the emission point (i.e., the
atomizer outlet, see Figure 1b) using a Shimadzu ultra-high-speed HPV-2 video camera capable
of recording up to 106 fps. The videos were illuminated
with a high-intensity Walimex Pro Studio Flash (VC-4000) positioned
on the opposite side of the camera, across the FB atomizer (Figure 1b). The flash was
synchronized with the video camera’s power unit through an
external trigger. The camera began recording 1 ms after the trigger
was manually switched on.15,21 The camera recording
plane was focused along the centerline of the atomization output.
The videos were then processed with the freeware image analysis software
ImageJ34 to obtain the diameter of filaments.
To obtain the size distribution of filaments, several images recorded
at the same d and varying times were processed
with ImageJ and a minimum of 150 filaments were measured. Only individual
filaments were counted, that is, bundles whose filament diameters
are indistinguishable were screened out.

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Viscoelastic Nature of
PEO Aqueous Solutions
As the rheology of the solution plays
an important role in liquid
atomization processes, viscosity measurements were performed to investigate
the solution characteristics at threshold concentrations (ct, summarized in Table 1) at which liquid filaments are produced.
These concentrations were identified in preliminary atomization experiments
for each PEO molecular weight. The filaments remained present even
at 4 cm downstream from the atomizer’s outlet. We also show
that these filamentary structures maintain such shapes even at distances
as far as 8 cm from the emission point. For solution concentrations
below ct, only droplets or a mixture of
filaments and droplets are generated. Viscosity data of PEO solutions
at this threshold concentration are depicted in Figure 2 as a function of shear rate. The figure
indicates that PEO 100k 7 wt % exhibits a Newtonian-like behavior
within the measured shear rate range. Conversely, solutions of PEO
of higher molecular weight show increased viscoelastic properties.
Our results agree very well with more detailed measurements performed
by other authors using PEO of similar molecular weights.35 All solutions of PEO of Mv > 100k, in the concentration range used in this work,
exhibit
a shear thinning behavior. Ebagninin and co-workers35 and Grigorescu and Kulicke36 identified a shear-thickening behavior of PEO aqueous solutions
of a given critical concentration at relatively low shear rates. Such
concentration increased with decreasing the molecular weight of PEO.35,36 However, the solutions used herein show a shear thinning behavior
solely because their concentrations are below the critical value pointed
out by Grigorescu and Kulicke36 and by
Ebagninin et al.35 Note also that the shear
thinning properties of the solutions used in this work are not as
pronounced as it has been reported for aqueous solutions with a higher
PEO concentration.35 It thus appears as
though the viscosity of the solutions atomized with concentration ct, and which formed filaments, may approach
its value at the so-called infinite-shear rate as a consequence of
the peculiar stress concentration characteristic of the FB flow pattern.

Typically, polymer solutions exhibit five distinct states based
on their mass composition in a thermodynamically good solvent.35−39 To assess the rheological nature of our solutions, we have calculated
the so-called overlap concentration, c*, that is,
the critical concentration above which the polymer coils overlap in
solution (see, for instance, refs38,41 for a detailed
discussion on this topic). c* was estimated with Mv/Rg3NA, where Rg = 0.0215Mv0.583 (as reported
by Devanand and Selser42) is the radius
of gyration (in nm) of the polymer coil and NA is Avogadro’s number.40−43 In all calculations hereafter, Mv is given in units of g/mol. The values of
the overlap concentration are summarized in Table 1. The solution concentrations (c) that we have identified as threshold values (ct) to generate filaments with FB are of the order of c*, ct/c* ≈ , thus indicating that the polymer coil’s
overlap plays a key role in filament formation with FB. Similar results
were obtained for other jetting processes such as electrospinning,44 although the physics behind the filament production
process differs radically from the one presented herein. As in this
work the ratio of atomized solution concentration to overlap concentration c/c* ≈ 1, they fall under the so-called
semidilute regime.36−39,45 In these types of semidilute
solutions, intermolecular interactions and entanglements may become
relevant. The nature of entanglements at concentrations above the
so-called entanglement concentration, ce, leads to viscoelastic properties observed in shear flow experiments.36,37 Some authors have modeled the transition from dilute to concentrated
solutions using a Bueche plot, that is, a graph of the zero-shear
rate viscosity (η0) as a function of the product
of concentration times the molecular weight of the polymer (M). Generally, below a critical molecular weight, η0 is directly proportional to M, and above
such threshold, it is widely accepted that η0 is
proportional to M3.4 for polymer melts.
This viscosity increase has been attributed to intermolecular entanglement
in the polymer chains.36

Figure 3 depicts
the viscosity at zero-shear rate (η0) as a function
of a dimensionless Bueche parameter cm·Mv/Me for PEO in the range 100k to 4M measured in this work. In the figure, cm is the polymer concentration given in mass
fraction, Mv is its viscosity-average
molecular weight, and Me (4400 g/mol)
is the entanglement molecular weight of PEO in water.46 In the figure, the white squares represent data points
of polymeric solutions (with ct) which
when atomized formed filaments (the ones indicated in Table 1). Two distinct regimes are
distinguished, in agreement with literature reports.28,36,37 In the first regime, η0 is nearly directly proportional to the parameter cm·Mv/Me up to a value of ∼1, above which the
viscosity increases sharply. For cmMv/Me > 1, approximately
a 3.2-dependency of η0 on the dimensionless Bueche
parameter is observed, which is very close to the value of 3.4 reported
by others for the case of polymer melts (see Grigorescu and Kulicke36 and Shenoy et al.47). In our work, the critical value of the Bueche parameter (cm·Mv/Me) that results in atomization in the form of
liquid filaments appears to be in the range 1–2, thus resulting
in η0 of the order of 0.012 Pa·s. As mentioned
earlier, solutions with c/c* <
1, which correspond to cm·Mv/Me < 1 in Figure 2, are called dilute
solutions and are not able to generate stable filaments with FB, implying
that the filaments break up into smaller structures at short distances
from the atomizer’s outlet. It is thus clear that, under the
FB conditions used in this work, only semidilute solutions produce
stable filaments (with 3.2-dependency on cm·Mv/Me), which retain their structure even at distances as long as 8 cm
(∼114D) from the atomizer’s outlet.
We have calculated the so-called entanglement concentration, ce, the critical concentration above which the
polymer coils begin to form entanglements, with ne3(ν–1)/(MvA2) for solutions that were atomized
into filaments (see Table 1).42,45,48,49ne is the number
of monomers between entanglements and is calculated as the ratio of
the molecular weight of entanglement to the molecular weight of the
monomer, Me/Mo. For PEO in water, the exponent ν = 0.583 and A2 = 0.0184Mv–0.2 (in mL mol/g2).42 The condition
that establishes the onset for polymer entanglement in solution is
given by c > ce. As
our
data indicate, and as in our atomization experiments ct(=c)/c* ≈ 1,
it follows that ct/c*
< ce/c*; thus, the
atomized solutions are semidiluted, unentangled solutions. Although
the studied solutions do not form entanglements, the dependence of
η0 on Mv is thought to
originate from coil overlapping.

dimensionless parameter cmMv/Me. The white squares indicate
data of polymers atomized into filaments (Table 1).

3.2 Filament Production by FB-Based Atomization
of PEO Aqueous Solutions
The PEO solutions were then systematically
atomized with the FB device shown in Figure 1 at different gas pressures. It was observed
that at each Pg a minimum value of liquid
pressure is required to achieve a continuous and stable atomization
of the solutions into liquid filaments. Such stability has a relatively
strong dependence on Pl as shown in Figure 4. The figure depicts
images recorded right at the outlet of the FB device, d = 0 cm, at the same gas pressure (Pg = 4 bar) but varying liquid pressures: (a) 3.3 and (b) 3 bar. In Figure 4a, the liquid surface
appears to be formed by filamentary structures solely, whereas in Figure 4b smaller structures
are also observed (red circles). These smaller structures, which most
likely are generated in the atomizer’s interior, transform
into droplets downstream. Note also that their relative velocity appears
to be higher than that of the filamentous structures, as observed
in high-speed videos (not shown). Macroscopically, this “droplet”
production regime exhibited a “cloud” surrounding a
core filament bundle (and it was accompanied by a characteristic noise).
However, when the liquid pressure was increased by 0.3 bar (Figure 4a), the cloud disappeared
and only the filamentary structures were observed (while the noise
also ceased). It is important to note that the formation of filaments
at d = 0 cm is indicative that the FB is occurring,
as expected, in the atomizer’s interior, because they can only
be the result of the breakup of the liquid surface.

Figure 4 FB atomization of PEO
600k 0.8 wt % at Pg = 4 bar, (a) Pl = 3.3 bar and (b) Pl = 3.0 bar.

Subsequently, PEO aqueous
solutions were atomized at Pg = 3, 4,
5, and 6 bar, with Pl being the minimum
to produce filaments (generally, Pl was
∼0.7 bar lower than Pg). Figure 5 shows images of
a typical atomization of an aqueous solution of
PEO 600k 0.8 wt % recorded at varying distances (d) from the atomizer outlet with a high-speed video camera. Right
at the outlet (d = 0 cm, Figure 5a), the liquid surface is composed of filamentary
structures which appear to be interconnected, and at this position
it is difficult to discern the diameters of individual filaments.
However, 0.5 cm downstream of the outlet some of those threads have
separated from the core bundle, and there, several filament diameters
may be measured. Nevertheless, in the atomization core, a few (∼6)
main “thick” bundles are observed, and smaller filaments
also appear. Further downstream, the number of the core bundles is
reduced as it is their typical diameter as can be observed in the
images of Figure 5c–f.
It is important to mention that the filamentary structures appear
even at d = 8 cm from the emission point, which has
not been reported before. In other words, the filaments do not break
into droplets at d = 8 cm. For instance, Li reported
formation of filaments at distances as far as 4 cm from the atomizer
outlet.32 The lifetime of filaments from
polymeric solutions is associated to their extensional viscosity.
It is known that addition of a high molecular weight macromolecule
to a solvent such as water dramatically increases its extensional
viscosity. The variation of the mean filament diameter as a function
of d can be quantitatively observed in the size distributions
of Figure 6. The trend
indicates that the mean filament diameter shifts toward smaller sizes
as the filaments travel downstream. At d = 0.5 cm,
filaments’ diameters are in the range 10–130 μm
and some of them have a size of ∼190 μm, with a large
fraction of them having diameters of the order of 50 μm. As
they move downstream, the distributions shift toward smaller sizes
and at d = 8 cm they have diameters <100 μm,
with a major fraction having sizes smaller than 50 μm. The distributions
are well fitted by a lognormal function (continuous, red line). Note
that the measured viscosity of this viscoelastic, shear thinning PEO
solution is in the range ∼0.01 Pa·s. As measured in this
work and reported by others, the viscoelastic nature of PEO solutions
increases with the molecular weight of the polymer. In general, the
viscosity gradient as a function of shear rate is larger for PEO 4M
than for PEO 600k. It is thus expected that aqueous solutions of PEO
4M will exhibit a stronger shear thinning behavior when atomized under
the same gas and liquid pressure conditions than the solutions of
PEO 600k. In the current work, the solution of PEO 4M 0.2 wt % had
a measured viscosity of ∼0.05 Pa·s, half that of the solution
of PEO 600k 0.8 wt %. Figure 7 shows images of a typical atomization of an aqueous solution
of PEO 4M 0.2 wt % recorded at varying distances from the atomizer
outlet. Overall, the filament bundle dynamics is similar as in the
case of the 600k solution; that is, the diameter of the liquid ligament
decreases as it moves downstream. From Figure 8 it is evident that whereas at d = 0.5 cm the filaments’ diameters are in the range 10–190
μm, at d = 8 cm all diameters are below 50
μm. Note also that for a given d, the mean
diameter becomes slightly larger with increasing the polymer molecular
weight as observed from Figure 8 (d ≥ 0.5 cm), for the 4M case, compared
to the filaments from 600k PEO (Figure 6). This trend was observed for all atomized solutions.
Nevertheless, large filaments observed in the proximity of the atomizer
outlet in the case of the 600k solution (for instance at 1 cm, 100–150
μm) are not present in the case of the 4M PEO, perhaps because
of its increasing shear thinning nature. The so-called Deborah numbers
(De), the ratio of a time to relaxation to a “time
of observation”, of each of the atomized solutions are summarized
in Table 1; for this
calculation the atomizer’s orifice radius R (=D/2) was used as the characteristic length. That
is, , where ρ is the density of the solution,
σ is the surface tension, and λz is the longest
relaxation time in the Rouse–Zimm model. Although such a model
is only valid for dilute polymeric solutions, the atomized solutions’ c/c* ≈ , and thus it may be used as a first approximation.
The relaxation time was then estimated with  as
applied by other authors,50,51 where NA is Avogadro’s number, kB is the Boltzmann constant (1.38 × 10–23 m2 kg s–2 K–1), T is the absolute temperature, and ηs is
the solvent viscosity; in the limit of dominant hydrodynamic
interactions 1/ζ(3ν) is 0.422, and the intrinsic viscosity
was estimated with [η] = 0.0125Mv0.78 in units of mL/g, for PEO in water.43,52 The data show there is approximately three orders of magnitude difference
in the relaxation time between PEO 100k and PEO 4M solutions. Furthermore,
for PEO 100k (7 wt %) De ≪ 1, thus indicating
the lower viscoelastic nature of the filaments and a more Newtonian-like
behavior. Conversely, De increases as PEO molecular
weight increases, despite a decrease in zero-shear rate viscosity,
which is indicative of the remarkably strong viscoelastic behavior
of the solutions, particularly the 0.2 wt % PEO 4M. It is thus reasonable
to think that both the existence of filaments at distances far from
the emission point and the larger mean filament diameter as PEO molecular
weight increases are the result of the viscoelastic rheology of the
polymer solutions and the relatively slow relaxation rate.

All atomized solutions (see Table 1) exhibit two types of behaviors, which are
depicted
in Figure 9. The figure
shows the zero-shear rate viscosity as a function of solution composition
(polymer mass fraction) for PEO of different molecular weights, in
the range 100k to 4M. For relatively low values of η0, the atomized solutions formed droplets (data not shown), as in
the classical FB mechanism. Such result is in agreement with observations
by others during air-blast atomization of dilute polymeric solutions,
in which the concentration is well below c*. However,
the figure also depicts an abrupt change in the slope as the mass
fraction is increased above ct. Beyond
such value, a linear log–log relationship is observed, as indicated
by the straight lines (to guide the eye only) and the production of
filaments took place for all Pg used.
Such mass fraction coincides with the calculated c* of each solution, indicated by the arrows on the x-axis (each color corresponds to a specific PEO Mv). The filamentary structures were present at d = 8 cm, although in some cases droplets were also observed
at such a distance.

Figure 9 Viscosity at zero-shear rate of PEO solutions as a function
of
mass concentration. The arrows on the x-axis indicate
the value of c* for each PEO molecular weight.

We have also performed an analysis
of the parameters that govern
the atomization process and calculated the dimensionless Ohnesorge
number (Oh), which represents the ratio of viscous
forces to inertio-capillary forces, and given by . Figure
S1 in the Supporting Information file shows a dimensionless scaling parameter that
includes the Oh as a function of gas pressure for
PEO solutions at the threshold concentration that resulted in filaments
(Table 1). The parameter
is Oh(Mv/105Mo)0.33cm–0.35, where Mo is the molecular weight of the monomer and cm is the mass fraction of the polymer in solution at ct. Note that the parameter takes into account
the effect of polymer molecular weight and concentration. At a relatively
low pressure, the scaling parameter is slightly below unity for PEO
of all molecular weights. However, at Pg = 4 bar, it appears as though the scaling parameter reaches, first,
a maximum and then a plateau around unity. The graph shows that the
data points tend to collapse around the scaling parameter. Also note
that in the case of PEO 100k the Oh would be higher
than 1, thus indicating that viscous forces dominate the process.
Conversely, in the case of PEO of high molecular weight (≥600k)
the Oh would be smaller than 1 (>0.3) for all Pg, perhaps because of their marked shear thinning
nature compared with PEO 100k.

4 Conclusions
We have applied the FB method to massively generate liquid filaments.
The test liquids consisted of solutions of PEO of varying molecular
weights, in the range 100k to 4M, as well as varying concentrations.
Not all PEO solutions resulted in generation of filaments, but only
those above a threshold concentration value, which sets the onset
for liquid ligament formation for each molecular weight; such concentration
appears to be the well-known overlap concentration c* of polymer coils. The threshold concentration increased with decreasing
PEO molecular weight. For instance, for PEO of the lowest molecular
weight, 100k, the threshold concentration was 7 wt %, whereas for
4M such value decreased to 0.2 wt %. When solutions of concentrations
lower than c* were atomized, the typical functioning
mode of the FB was achieved, that is, sprays were produced. Except
for solutions of PEO 100k, all solutions exhibited a marked shear
thinning behavior. The droplet production and filament production
regimes were characterized using a Bueche parameter, that is, the
product of the mass fraction of PEO in the solution times the ratio
of viscosity–average molecular weight of PEO to its entanglement
molecular weight. In our experiments, the critical Bueche parameter
was . A 3.2-dependency of the zero-shear rate
viscosity on the Bueche parameter was found for filament production,
whereas a nearly linear dependency was found for droplet production.
As a general trend, the mean filament diameter decreased as a function
of the distance from the atomizer outlet. Furthermore, for a given
gas pressure the mean filament diameter increased with the rise of
the PEO molecular weight. This work sets a general and energetically
efficient approach for the massive production of liquid filaments,
at a rate of the order of tens of liters per hour, for an immense
variety of scientific and industrial applications such as biomedical
scaffolds, filters, fabrics, mats, paper, packaging stuff, artificial
hydroponic or aeroponic soils or substrates, and so forth. These fibrous
materials may thus be synthesized with our FB-enabled approach by
adding a postprocessing procedure, for instance, an on-line drying
step following filament generation. Conversely, an off-line step may
be used as well. In such a case, the filaments would be collected
onto a substrate and then calcined in an oven.
