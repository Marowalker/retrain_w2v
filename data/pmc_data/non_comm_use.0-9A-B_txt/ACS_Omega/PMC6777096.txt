Hybrid and double-hybrid density functionals are employed
to explore the O–NO bond dissociation mechanism of vinyl nitrite
(CH2=CHONO) into vinoxy (CH2=CHO)
and nitric monoxide (NO). In contrast to previous investigations,
which point out that the O–NO bond dissociation of vinyl nitrite
is barrierless, our computational results clearly reveal that a kinetic
barrier (first-order saddle point) in the O–NO bond dissociation
is involved. Furthermore, a radical–radical adduct is recommended
to be present on the dissociation path. The activation and reaction
enthalpies at 298.15 K for the vinyl nitrite dissociation are calculated
to be 91 and 75 kJ mol–1 at the M062X/MG3S level,
respectively, and the calculated reaction enthalpy compares very well
with the experimental result of 76.58 kJ mol–1.
The M062X/MG3S reaction energetics, gradient, Hessian, and geometries
are used to estimate vinyl nitrite dissociation rates based on the
multistructural canonical variational transition-state theory including
contributions from hindered rotations and multidimensional small-curvature
tunneling at temperatures from 200 to 3000 K, and the rate constant
results are fitted to the four-parameter Arrhenius expression of 4.2

Introduction
Nitroethylene (CH2=CHNO2) as the simplest member of the nitro-olefin
series was usually considered to be a useful surrogate for understanding
the behavior of nitro groups in the insensitive high energetic material
1,1-diamino-2,2-dinitro-ethylene (DADNE). Due to the fact that the
experimental interpretations of decomposition processes of energetic
materials are very complicated, quantum chemical calculations have
been performed by Gindulytė et al.,1 Shamov et al.,2 and Khrapkovskii et al.3 to investigate the unimolecular decomposition
mechanism of nitroethylene. Four distinct thermally initiated gas-phase
decomposition pathways have been identified: direct C–NO2 bond fission (R1), nitro to nitrite
rearrangement with subsequent O–NO bond fission to yield CH2CHO and NO (R2), which is a result of
the weak O–NO bond, HONO elimination reaction with formation
of acetylene (R3), and 1,3-H shift with generation
of CH2=CN(O)OH (R4). Furthermore,
the nitro to nitrite rearrangement (R2) was found
to be energetically favored by the decomposition of nitroethylene.1−3 R1   R2   R3   R4  The theoretical
studies above concerned with the C–NO2 bond rupture
of nitroethylene proposed that there was no maximum on this reaction
pathway, as will be confirmed in this work. With respect to the NO
release of vinyl nitrite in the ground state, it was also assumed
to be barrierless in the same manner,1−4 i.e., the absence of
a saddle point based on the similarity of thermal destruction of aliphatic
nitrites. In this respect, it was interesting to note that a maximum
in energy was observed from our potential energy surface scan for
the O–NO bond cleavage of vinyl nitrite in this work. However,
experimental information on the detailed mechanisms of the title reaction
was still insufficient, and no experimental evidence of an activation
barrier has been observed for the decomposition of vinyl nitrite.5,6 In this connection, elucidation of whether the transition state
exists for the radical decomposition of vinyl nitrite becomes an important
issue that will be addressed below.

If the activation barrier
exists, it would produce a remarkable effect on the decomposition
rate constant and a critical difference in understanding experimental
measurements. Unimolecular pre-exponential factors for loose bond
dissociations are very high, whereas pre-exponential factors for the
well-defined transition-state saddle points would be much lower, which
would increase the lifetimes of intermediate species and in turn slow
down the dissociation. Furthermore, quantum kinetics near the transition
state, e.g., reaction path curvature, plays a crucial role in the
state-to-state reaction dynamics. Therefore, understanding the fundamental
reactivity of vinyl nitrite is a key component for improving the decomposition
chemistry model of nitroethylene.

To describe this abnormal
dissociation behavior, quantum chemical calculations have been performed
on the vinyl nitrite dissociation to characterize the potential surface
with the aim of proving whether the reaction has a well-defined transition
state. Furthermore, high-pressure-limit rate constants are calculated
at temperatures between 200 and 3000 K relevant for pyrolysis chemistry
by means of multistructural canonical variational transition-state
theory with multidimensional tunneling correction.

Results and Discussion
Potential Energy Surface for the O–NO Bond Rupture
The potential energy surface for CH2=CHONO →
CH2=CHO + NO, as shown in Figure 1, is calculated at the M062X/MG3S level to
cover the O–N bond with separation from 1.404 to 4.104 Å
using an interval step of 0.1 Å with other geometric parameters
fully optimized and taking the spin multiplicity as 1. The M062X/MG3S
dissociation curve for CH2=CHNO2 →
CH2=CH + NO2 with the distance between
the bonding C and N atoms is also depicted in Figure 1 for comparison. One can observe that the
energy of the system [CH2=CH···NO2] first increases with the increasing bond length and then
reaches a plateau, appearing without a tight transition state along
the reaction coordinate. The relative energy of CH2=CH
+ NO2 to CH2=CHNO2 is calculated
to be 314.1 kJ mol–1 without ZPE correction. When
ZPE correction and thermal correction to enthalpy are taken into account,
this energy value is reduced to 298.5 kJ mol–1,
which is in excellent agreement with the experimental result7 of 299.2 kJ mol–1. Nevertheless,
the homolytic cleavage process of the O–NO bond of vinyl nitrite
involves a maximum point in energy, as mentioned in the Introduction, and the structure with peak potential energy
is most likely a transition state. In addition, CH2=CHONO
immediately dissociates via O–NO bond scission to form CH2=CHO + NO upon CH2=CHONO formation.
This is a result of the much weaker O–NO bond relative to the
C–N bond of CH2=CHNO2.

B2PLYP,13 B2PLYPD,14 B2PLYPD3,15,16 mPW2PLYP,17 and mPW2PLYPD14 with the TZVP

the vinyl nitrite dissociation has a well-defined transition-state
saddle point via the “TS” and “QST3” calculations
with the “Guess = Mix” keyword to break the spin symmetry. Figure 2 depicts the optimized
geometries of the stationary points, and selected geometrical parameters
obtained with the various DFT-based electronic model chemistries used
in this study are compared in Table 1 and the agreement is good. The detailed geometries,
rotational constants, and vibrational frequencies obtained at various

a Bond lengths are in Å and dihedral angles are in
degrees.

Reasonably
similar tight transition-state structures have been identified. The
optimized separation distances between the O and N atoms of the transition
state are quite consistent across all adopted levels of theory, as
presented in Table 1, which correspond to the first-order saddle points characterized
by only one imaginary frequency, confirming the process of the combination
and separation of the CH2=CHO and NO fragments.
In addition, the IRC calculations confirm that the transition state
connects to the CH2=CHONO minimum-energy geometry
on the reactant side, and on the product side, the IRC path did not
dissociate into the free products but instead led via a movement of
the NO moiety to a hydrogen-bonded OC(H)C(H)H···NO
radical–radical complex (IM). See Figure 1 for schematic structures of the stationary
points. This represents quite a mechanistic oversight to assume the
CH2=CHONO → CH2=CHO + NO
reaction to be barrierless. The transition state has a biradical character,
and the geometrical parameters of the CH2=CHO and
NO fragments in the transition structure are almost the same as those
in their equilibrium structures obtained at the same theoretical level.

The O–NO bond dissociation of singlet vinyl nitrite proceeds
via a spin-flip process to yield two doublet radicals, where two electrons
initially paired in the O–NO bonding orbital become separated
into two different orbitals, introducing evident problems associated
with spin contamination. At the equilibrium geometry, the two electrons
in the O–NO bonding orbital are correlated, but this correlation
energy disappears once the bond is broken. Furthermore, the vinoxy
radical is stabilized between the CH2=CH–O• and •CH2–CH=O
conformations (the dot • denotes the radical center) with the
latter being predominant. Therefore, it is necessary to assess whether
single-reference methods are suitable for accurate investigations
of this system. In this work, the T1 diagnostic of Lee and Taylor19 was employed to measure the multireference character
for the M062X/MG3S- and B2PLYPD3/TZVP-optimized geometries by the
CCSD20,21/cc-pVnZ and aug-cc-pVnZ (n = D, T)22−24 calculations, and the T1 diagnostic results
are presented in Table 2.

As can be seen in Table 2, T1 parameters <0.045 are evaluated for the open-shell
systems,25 despite the severe problems
associated with TS, IM, and CH2=CHO. In addition,
those for the spin-restricted geometry (CH2=CHONO)
are calculated to be lower than the threshold of 0.02,19 suggesting that the decomposition reaction of
vinyl nitrite can be correctly characterized using the above-mentioned
single-reference methods. Furthermore, our calculated values of the
vibrational frequencies for vinyl nitrite and vinoxy radicals are
in good agreement with the MP2/6-31G(d,p), MP2/6-31G(d), and B3LYP/6-311G(2d,d,p)
results,1,26,27 as compared
in the Supporting Information. Thus, previously
computed single-reference reaction energies for the overall reaction
CH2=CHONO → CH2=CHO + NO
are likely to be reasonable, and the DFT methods employed in this
work are applicable for the direct dynamics calculations.

Table 3 presents the activation
energies for the O–NO bond dissociation of vinyl nitrite. One
can see that gratifying results are achieved by different single-reference
methods, especially at the double-hybrid density functionals with
the TZVP basis set and the M062X/MG3S level, for estimating the transition-state
energies (barrier heights calculated by taking the energy difference
between the reactant and transition-state structures).

As can
be seen in Table 4,
the vinyl nitrite dissociation reaction is calculated to be an endothermic
process. The M062X/MG3S level provides a reaction enthalpy of 75.14
kJ mol–1 with ZPE correction included at 298.15
K, concurring with the determination of 76.58 kJ mol–1 using the involved species enthalpies of formation: experimentally

ΔHf,298o(CH2CHONO) = 30.12 kJ mol–1 via a variety of homodesmic
and isodesmic reactions by Snitsiriwat et al.27 Other theoretical calculations all underestimate the reaction enthalpy,
i.e., at the B2PLYPD3/TZVP and mPW2PLYPD/TZVP levels, this value is
calculated to be 63.75 and 58.38 kJ mol–1, respectively,
which is about 13 and 18 kJ mol–1, respectively,
lower than the experimentally based value. In view that the M062X/MG3S
level performs well to predict thermochemistries of species, it will
be selected for the anharmonic torsion and kinetics calculations to
be carried out in the next sections.

Multistructural and Torsional Anharmonicities
Two internal
rotations about the O–NO and C–ONO bonds in the trans-vinyl nitrite and TS structures are involved, which
are denoted τ-i and τ-ii, respectively, and ϕ1(O–N–O–C) and ϕ2(N–O–C–C)
correspond to the two torsional angles specified above. The total
energies as functions of torsion angles are calculated by scanning
the torsion angles between 0° and 360° with the step size
of 5°. At every step, we constrain the dihedral angle corresponding
to a specific torsion, and then a minimum or a saddle point is obtained
by the full optimizations of the remaining degrees of freedom. The
M062X/MG3S-based one-dimensional τ-i and τ-ii potentials
are pictured in Figure 3 for the lowest-energy conformers (trans configuration)
of vinyl nitrite.

Figure 3 One-dimensional
potentials
for the (a) τ-i internal rotation about the O–NO bond
and (b) τ-ii internal rotation around the C–ONO bond
in the trans-vinyl nitrite structure calculated at
the M062X/MG3S level. Data in the figure denotes the energy differences
between the jth conformer and trans-vinyl nitrite.

As can be found in Figure 3a, two different minima are observed on the
τ-i potential plot, leading to the number of distinguishable
minima (Pj,τ) for
τ-i of trans-vinyl nitrite equal to 2 with
στ-i being unity. The deep minimum (trans configuration
of the nitrite group) is predicted to be more stable than the shallow
one (cis isomer) by about 7 kJ mol–1 without ZPE
included. The O–NO internal rotation in vinyl nitrite exhibits
a symmetric twofold significantly high barrier of 49 kJ mol–1, which is not corrected for ZPEs. It can be argued that the rotation
of the NO moiety about the O–NO bond seems very difficult.
The τ-ii torsional potential profile in Figure 3b involves the locations of three minima
from 0 to 360°. Except for the most stable trans conformer of
vinyl nitrite, the other two minima, which are isoenergetic, correspond
to the mirror-image structures; therefore, they are distinguishable.
The connectivity between these two mirror-image structures (labeled
as Reactant-3 and Reactant-4) exhibits a low torsional barrier height
of 1.2 kJ mol–1, whereas the transformation of trans-vinyl nitrite to Reactant-3 or Reactant-4 structures
requires to surmount a high zero-point-exclusive barrier height of
about 15 kJ mol–1.

In the relaxed
scan of the τ-i torsion of the TS structure, the transformation
between the CH2=CH–O• and •CH2–CH=O fragments with large
bond length changes is involved. Chuang and Truhlar’s approach29 is employed to treat the torsional anharmonicity
of τ-i of TS. Figure 4 depicts the M062X/MG3S-based τ-ii potential for the
lowest-energy TS conformer. Two different minima are observed on the
τ-ii potential plot. These two isoenergetic minima correspond
to the mirror-image structures (TS-1 and TS-2), leading to Pj,τ equaling 2 with στ-ii being unity. The connectivity between TS-1 and TS-2
requires to get over a significant zero-point-exclusive barrier height
of about 26 kJ mol–1.

Figure 5 depicts the four
distinguishable conformations of vinyl nitrite due to the strong coupling
between the τ-i and τ-ii torsional motions, and TS-1 and
TS-2 geometries are also included. Then, the same relaxed scan procedure
is also carried out on all uncoupled torsions for the cis conformer
and Reactant-3 geometries of vinyl nitrite. The information about
the fully optimized geometries, rotational constants, harmonic vibrational
frequencies, and Fourier series for one-dimensional τ-i and
τ-ii potentials of all conformers for vinyl nitrite is summarized
in the Supporting Information.

Table 5 presents the torsional
information for all structures of vinyl nitrite and TS related to
its partition function approximations. Uj denotes the energy difference between the jth structure and the most stable conformer, and Uj for the global minimum conformations

a Fvinyl nitriteMS-LH and FTSMS-LH, multistructural harmonic factors of vinyl
nitrite and transition state, respectively; Fvinyl nitriteT and FTST, torsional anharmonicity factors of vinyl nitrite and transition
state, respectively; Fvinyl nitriteMS-T and FTSMS-T, ratios
of the MS-T partition functions to the single-structure, rigid-rotor
harmonic-oscillator ones for vinyl nitrite and transition state, respectively; FMS-T, the reaction-specific multistructural
torsional anharmonicity factor.

As can be seen
in Table 6, deviations
between the torsional partition functions and the harmonic ones for
vinyl nitrite grow more significant with temperature and the anharmonic
ones approach the high-temperature limit of the free rotor. However,
the harmonic ones rise steadily and cannot characterize the torsions
reliably. The FTST factor for the transition state exhibits the
same behavior, as outlined in Table 6. Since trans-vinyl nitrite accounts
for the global minimum conformer, the approximation of the MS-LH factor
of vinyl nitrite leads to 1.000 at 50 K with the fj,τ and Zj factors in eq 7 being unity. With the elevated temperature,
the three less stable conformations begin to contribute to the overall
partition functions of vinyl nitrite, and the Fvinyl nitriteMS-LH values rise significantly to 5.656 at 3000 K. The FTSMS-LH component
of the species-specific F-factor for the transition
state in Table 6 is
equal to 2 at all temperatures since TS has only one additional structure,
its isoenergetic mirror image. Here, this leads to the conclusion
that, for vinyl nitrite and transition state, the multiple-structural
anharmonicity (FαMS-LH) predominates at low temperatures
compared to the torsional effect (FαT) and makes a pronounced
contribution to FαMS-T, and with the increasing temperature,
the torsional anharmonicity factors (FαT) of the
vinyl nitrite and transition state appear more remarkable.

Rate Constants
The M062X/MG3S-calculated
minimum-energy path potential (VMEP),
local zero-point vibrational energy (ZPE), and vibrationally adiabatic
ground-state potential energy (VaG) with respect to the reaction
coordinate (s) for the O–NO bond dissociation
of vinyl nitrite are depicted in Figure 6. Location s corresponds
to the distance along the MEP with s = 0 at the first-order
saddle point. MEP terminates on the reactant side for negative s and on the product side for positive s. VMEP(s) value represents
the potential energy at location s relative to trans-vinyl nitrite (VMEP(s → −∞) = 0). ZPE(s) is computed with the M062X/MG3S-based Hessian results scaled by
0.97, and VaG(s) is obtained through adding VMEP(s) to VMEP(s). Note that at high energies, very
small amounts of points with large T1 parameters are exhibited, and
they have been omitted from VMEP.

Figure 6 M062X/MG3S minimum-energy
path potential VMEP(s), ZPE(s), and vibrationally adiabatic ground-state
potential VaG(s) profiles for the O–NO
bond dissociation of vinyl nitrite.

For
the O–NO bond dissociation of vinyl nitrite, the notable geometry
changes primarily occur in the reaction coordinate range from −3.69
to 1.55 bohr, as seen from VMEP(s) in Figure 6, and then they proceed by the rearrangement of heavy atoms to approach
the vinyl nitrite or IM structures. A lower concave can be observed
ranging from −0.59 to 0.52 bohr on the ZPE(s) profile, which leads to that VaG(s) gets its
maximum in energy at s = −0.15 bohr, indicating
that the variational effect should be taken into consideration in
the kinetic modeling.

This work employs various levels of theory
including TST, CVT, ICVT, and MS-CVT to calculate the high-pressure-limit
rate constants using the M062X/MG3S-based gradients, force constants,
geometries, and energetics. Tunneling probabilities are taken into
account by utilizing the ZCT and SCT approximations. Here, it should
be noted that the overall rotational symmetry number for a given species
has been included in its partition function approximations, and the
chiral effect of Reactant-3 or TS based on the fact that the two isoenergetic
mirror-image structures make equivalent influence to the total partition
function has been taken into consideration in the MS-CVT approximations
by the multistructural factor, FαMS-LH.

The TST, CVT,
ICVT, CVT/ZCT, CVT/SCT, and MS-CVT/SCT rate constants at various temperatures
are outlined in Table 7, where /ZCT or /SCT denotes that ZCT or SCT tunneling estimates
are included in the rate constants.

As can be seen in Table 7, the CVT rate constants
are appreciably overestimated by the TST evaluations, and the difference
between the TST and CVT rate constants first decreases with temperature
and then increases with the elevated temperature, i.e., factors of kTST to kCVT are
estimated to be 4.94, 2.55, 3.09, 3.91, and 4.31, respectively, at
200, 650, 1000, 2000, and 3000 K. The variational transition states
move toward negative from s = −0.29 bohr at
200 K to location s = −0.38 bohr at 640 K.
When the temperature is above 650 K, the generalized free energy of
activation at −0.64 bohr becomes larger than that at −0.38
Å and then moves gradually to location s = −0.67
bohr at 3000 K. This clearly shows the importance of variational effects
in the vinyl nitrite dissociation, and inclusion of variational approximations
would provide more reasonable rate constants. Furthermore, it is found
that the microcanonical effect is negligible on the rate constants
of the vinyl nitrite dissociation with kCVT almost equal to kICVT and thus the tunneling
effect is discussed based on the CVT rate constants.

At high
temperatures, the CVT/SCT and CVT/ZCT rate constants approach the
CVT ones asymptotically since more and more vinyl nitrite molecules
dissociate either by the pathway above the barrier or by the vibrational
tunnel very close to the barrier. With the decreasing reaction temperature,
the ZCT and SCT tunneling effects in an analogous way become increasingly
important in the estimations of the rate constants, and most of the
vinyl nitrite molecules dissociate by the pathway through the barrier
with small vibrational activation. Since the process CH2=CHONO → CH2=CHO + NO involves a
fairly high activation barrier, as shown in Table 3, the tunneling effect is observed to be
modestly significant. Due to the fact that the local reaction path
curvature close to the transition state is taken into consideration
in the SCT tunneling, the CVT/SCT rate constants appear generally
greater than the CVT/ZCT ones at the same temperature (the factors
for kCVT/SCT:kCVT/ZCT are 2.31, 1.03, 1.01, and 1.00 at 200, 1000, 2000, and 3000 K, respectively),
confirming the significant role of the small-curvature effects, especially
at low temperatures. Furthermore, multiple-structural anharmonicities
produce a substantial effect on the rate constant evaluations at low
temperatures, increasing them by factors of 1.84 and 1.17 at 200 and
400 K, respectively, whereas with the increased temperature, torsional
anharmonicities become increasingly critical, and the MS-CVT rate
constants are 0.81, 0.39, and 0.34 times the CVT estimates at 600,
2000, and 3000 K, respectively.

Because of the lack of experimental
data for the O–NO dissociation of vinyl nitrite, it is hoped
that this work will enable a more rigorous understanding of the underlying
chemistry and facilitate a detailed comparison between theory and
future experiments to refine the chemical kinetic mechanisms for nitroethylene
pyrolysis.

This work employs the four-parameter modified Arrhenius
functional to describe the temperature dependence of the MS-CVT/SCT
rate constants over the temperature range 200–3000 K with a
step of 50 K. These parameters in eq 12 are obtained through minimizing the root-mean-square
residual (RMSR), which is given by 4  with N being the total number of temperatures, k(Ti) the MS-CVT/SCT
rate constant at Ti,
and kM(p1, p2, p3, p4, Ti) the
computed rate constants by eq 12. The four parameters are given by the frequency factor A = 4.2 × 109 s–1, E = 87.5 kJ mol–1, n =
4.3, and T0 = −32.6 K for the reaction
kinetic model of vinyl nitrite dissociation.

Conclusions
Quantum chemical calculations
are performed to explore the detailed kinetic mechanism for the O–NO
dissociation of vinyl nitrite to produce CH2=CHO
+ NO. There are indications that the title reaction involves a transition
state with a well-defined saddle point connected to a hydrogen-bonded
complex directly instead of ultimate products (CH2=CHO
+ NO) from our computational results, and the activation energy at
298.15 K for the O–NO dissociation of vinyl nitrite is calculated
to be 91 kJ mol–1 at the M062X/MG3S level. Direct
kinetics calculations demonstrate that tunneling appears to be important
at low temperatures and variational effects on the computed rate constants
are observed to be evident. Torsional and multiple-structure anharmonic
effects in the vinyl nitrite and transition state considerably influence
the rate constants, especially at high temperatures. The M062X/MG3S
rate constants in units of per second based on the MS-CVT calculations
with corrections from SCT tunneling, hindered rotation, and variational
effects are fitted to the four-parameter Arrhenius form for the temperature
range of 200–3000 K. Note that some strong features proposed
by our calculations have not been observed, thus serving as predictions.

Computational Details
Electronic Energy Calculations
The Gaussian 09 computational
package was employed for the theoretical calculations.32 The ground-state geometries on the potential
energy surface were fully optimized with the hybrid density functionals
BB1K,8,9 MPWB1K,10 and
M062X11 in combination with the MG3S basis
set12 without symmetry restrictions. In
addition, a series of double-hybrid density functionals B2PLYP,13 B2PLYPD,14 B2PLYPD3,15,16 mPW2PLYP,17 and mPW2PLYPD14 in conjunction with the TZVP basis set18 have also been employed to characterize the
vinyl nitrite dissociation. For the singlet species, CH2=CHONO, the spin-restricted method was used; otherwise, unrestricted
methods were employed for the NO and CH2=CHO radicals,
postreaction CH2=CHO···NO complex
(IM), and transition state, with their wave function instability being
checked.

Critical points were checked by counting no imaginary
frequency for local minima and a single imaginary frequency for the
transition state. The calculated values of vibrational frequencies
are given in the Supporting Information. The transition state (TS) accounting for first-order saddle point
is characterized by a single imaginary frequency, i.e., 755i cm–1 at the M062X/MG3S level, 390i cm–1 at the B2PLYP/TZVP level, and 421i cm–1 at the mPW2PLYP/TZVP level, which
describe properly the desired breaking/forming process for the O–NO
bond of vinyl nitrite. Minimum-energy path (MEP) is calculated using
the intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) algorithm33,34 with
a step of 0.07 bohr to verify the connection between the transition
state and the desired reactant and product. The rate constant is computed
using the M062X/MG3S gradients and Hessian of 90 selected points (50
and 40 points on the reactant and product sides, respectively) on
MEP.

Zero-point energies and thermal corrections to enthalpy
and Gibbs free energy were computed with the same level. The HDFT
energetics includes zero-point energy (ZPE) corrections. Taking the
account of electronic uncertainty, the BB1K/MG3S, MPWB1K/MG3S, M062X/MG3S,
and B2PLYP/TZVP ZPEs were, respectively, scaled by factors of 0.957,
0.954, 0.970, and 0.9832.35,36 The scaling factors
for the B2PLYPD, B2PLYPD3, mPW2PLYP, and mPW2PLYPD with the TZVP basis
set ZPEs are taken as the same as that for the B2PLYP/TZVP ZPEs.

Rate Constant Calculations
Multistructural
canonical variational transition-state theory37,38 (MS-CVT)
was employed to calculate the high-pressure-limit rate constants in
the gas phase, defined as follows 5  where kCVT(T) is the
single-structure CVT39,40 rate constant, and the reaction-specific
multistructural torsional anharmonicity factor, FMS-T, accounts for torsional and multiple-structure anharmonic
effects.

Total partition functions for a given chemical species
are defined as products of the electronic (Qelec), translational (Qtrans),
and conformational–rovibrational (Qcon-rovib) contributions 6  According
to the multistructural treatment for torsional anharmonicity38 (MS-T), the conformational–rovibrational
partition function is calculated via 7  with J being
the number of distinguishable structures for a given species, kB Boltzmann’s constant, T the temperature, t the torsion number in structure j, and Uj the
energy difference between the jth structure and the
most stable conformer. In eq 7, for the jth structure, fj,τ denotes the internal coordinate
torsional anharmonicity, QjQH is the normal-mode
harmonic-oscillator vibrational partition function, Qrot,j is the classical rotational partition
function, and the MS-T calculations reach the correct high-temperature
limit by the Zj factor.
Here, it should be noted that the rotational symmetry numbers of the
reactant and TS are directly included in their respective rotational
partition function calculations.

The FαMS-T factor
is defined as the ratio of the MS-T partition function to the single-structure,
rigid-rotor harmonic-oscillator (SS-RRHO) one for the α species 8  and it can be divided into two components: a multistructural harmonic
factor, FαMS-LH, and a torsional factor, FαT 9  to assess the multiple-structural and torsional
anharmonicity, respectively. Qcon-rovib,αMS-LH in eq 9 denotes the multistructural
normal-mode harmonic partition function. Accordingly, the reaction-specific
factor, FMS-T, is given by 10  where the effect
of chirality is taken into consideration.

Tunneling contributions
are treated by the multidimensional zero-curvature tunneling41 (ZCT) and small-curvature tunneling42 (SCT) approximations. By substituting the appropriate
tunneling predictions into the MS-CVT rate constants, the overall
rate constants are computed by 11  The single-structure CVT rate constants,
as well as ZCT and SCT tunneling corrections, are evaluated by the
Polyrate 9.7 program43 with the M062X/MG3S
structures, energies, gradients, and force constants of the adopted
points along MEP as inputs.

Discrete MS-CVT/SCT rate constants
for the vinyl nitrite dissociation in the temperature range of 200–3000
K with a step of 50 K are fitted to the four-parameter modified Arrhenius
expression44 12  where A, n, T0, and E are the
parameters of the modified Arrhenius equation.
