DNA
molecular compaction/decompaction is of great significance
for the exploration of basic life processes, the research of biomedical
and genetic engineering, and so forth. However, the detailed mechanism
of DNA compaction/decompaction caused by surfactants remains an open
and challenging problem that has not been fully solved so far. In
this paper, a sort of novel solid substrate, nanoPAA-ZnCl2-AuLs, with good stability and high sensitivity, was prepared by
a self-assembly method. Based on this substrate, the surface-enhanced
Raman scattering (SERS) technology was employed to investigate characteristics
of interactions between DNA molecules and surfactants at a single
molecular level. SERS spectra of calf thymus DNA (ctDNA), cetyl trimethyl
ammonium bromide (CTAB), and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) with a concentration
as low as 10–9 M, and SERS spectra of ctDNA–CTAB
and ctDNA–CTAB–SDS composites were collected, respectively.
The interactions between ctDNA and surfactants were analyzed by changes
in SERS spectra, for example, disappearances and appearances of SERS
bands and relative changes of peak intensity, in which CTAB resulted
in the compaction of the DNA molecule while SDS induced the decompaction
of the ctDNA–CTAB complex. Moreover, UV–visible spectrophotometry
was employed to demonstrate the compaction/decompaction of ctDNA molecules
caused by surfactants. The local binding modes of ctDNA molecules
and surfactant molecules were expounded. This work will be helpful
for understanding biological processes such as DNA compaction and
recombination within nucleus or/and cells and for the development
of gene therapy technologies.

1 Introduction
Exploring
the conformation changes of DNA molecules in detail and
revealing their mechanisms accurately, such as the compaction/decompaction
of DNA molecules induced by the interaction of various surfactants,
are both of great significance for expanding fields of basic research
in molecular biology and developing practical technologies of biomedical
engineering.

The fact that DNA molecules can be used as carriers
of drugs1 or nonviral genes has received
much attention.2,3 During the delivery process, DNA
molecules are compacted into small
particles under the action of surfactants, by which they are protected
from the degradation of nucleases, and then they penetrate through
the membrane and move inside the cell under external forces. Subsequently,
the DNA complexes are decompacted to release the drugs/nonviral genes.
With this method, the amount of effective drugs/non-viral genes absorbed
by a cell will be substantially increased. This technique has been
utilized for gene transfer, gene transfection, gene therapy, and so
on,4−6 and this procedure has been employed as a typical model for DNA
extraction7 and purification.8

In order to investigate the interaction
between DNA molecules and
surfactants, scientists have proposed many methods,9−13 including zeta potential measurement, dynamic light
scattering measurement, agarose gel electrophoresis, conductivity
measurement, tension measurement, circular dichroism, isothermal titration
calorimetry, fluorescence imaging, and so forth. By evaluating the
overall properties (e.g. electrical, optical, and mechanical) of surfactants
and DNA molecules, interactions between surfactants and DNA molecules
can be deduced. However, because detections are carried out on a large
number of molecules with the concentration of ca. 10–5 M, these traditional technologies are only capable of reflecting
average effect. Furthermore, it is required to use complex chemical
methods to covalently connect optical or electroactive indicators
to the specific sites of DNA molecules, which is complicated and difficult
to operate.

The local binding pattern of surfactant to DNA molecule
at single
molecular level was unable to be directly determined until the 1990s.
A variety of techniques have been developed to accurately explore
the interaction information between DNA molecules and surfactants,
that is optical tweezers, atomic force microscopy, magnetic tweezers,
and other biological single molecule manipulation techniques.14−17 However, the measurement accuracies are severely affected by environmental
conditions, that is temperature, mechanical vibration, airflow, and/or
electronic noise.18 So far, it is still
an openly challenging problem that needs a lot of efforts to elucidate
the mechanism of surfactants-induced DNA molecular compaction and
decompaction at a single-molecule level.

Raman scattering spectroscopy
is one of the efficient technologies
and has been used to study structural information of single biomolecules.19,20 Each molecule has its own unique vibrational modes (molecular vibration,
lattice vibration, rotation, etc.),21 which
can be identified by Raman scattering spectra. For example, peak position
reflects the composition of the sample, peak shift reflects the tension
or stress, peak intensity reveals the total amount of the substance,
peak width expresses the quality, and Raman polarization reflects
the symmetry and orientation of the crystal.22 By analyzing the Raman spectra, the information of molecular structures
and slight variations can be distinctly obtained. However, the intensity
of Raman spectra is much weaker than that of the Rayleigh spectra,
only 10–3 to 10–6 times. Some
molecular information cannot be revealed.

In recent years, surface-enhanced
Raman scattering (SERS) technology
has been rapidly developed and made good progress,23 the intensity of Raman spectra can be selectively enhanced
by 106 times. SERS can investigate the sample structure
at a single molecule level and explore the molecular interaction model.
It has been used to study the configuration and conformation, and
analyze the structure of biological molecules.24,25 As for the principle of SERS intensity enhancement, there are widely
accepted explanations of physical and chemical mechanisms. The physical
mechanism is that when a beam of laser excites the surface of SERS
substrate, the surface plasmon resonance is generated, the local electric
field intensity is increased, and the peak intensity of Raman spectra
is enhanced in a large frequency range. The region where the local
electric field intensity increases through surface plasmon resonance
is defined as a hot spot. The main content of the chemical enhancement
mechanism is that the chemical bond formed between the molecules absorbed
onto the surface of the metal substrate and the metal surface can
change the polarizability of the sample molecules, resulting in some
selective enhancement of Raman peaks.

For SERS applications,
selection of SERS-active substrates is crucial.
Generally, SERS substrates can be divided into two categories according
to the types of substrate materials. That is, one is metal nanoparticle
sol,26,27 and the other is a solid nanostructure.28,29 About the former, the SERS measurement is performed by adding an
analyte sample to a metal nanoparticle sol, and the nanoparticles
are aggregated to generate an electromagnetic hot spot; thus, the
SERS effect will be achieved. Applications of colloidal particles
are generally limited to their irregular size and shape and uncontrollable
aggregations. In addition, analytes are easily contaminated by nanoparticle
sols, which would severely affect the accuracy of SERS detection.
As for the latter, solid nanostructures may include nanostructures
prepared directly on a solid substrate using nanofabrication methods,
or assembly of metal nanoparticles on a solid substrate. SERS technology
based on solid substrate has more advantages, for example, convenient
operation, high stability, diversified forms, and controllable structure.

Our research group has developed multiple solid complex substrates.28,30 Here, the nanoporous anodic alumina (nanoPAA)-ZnCl2-AuLs
substrate is first prepared and experimentally demonstrated that it
can be capable of detecting rhodamine 6G (R6G) solution with a concentration
as low as 10–11 M [Figure S1]. Compared with the Au nanoparticle film over a glass slide, the
SERS intensity of R6G solution on nanoPAA-ZnCl2-AuLs substrates
is enhanced by 7.8 times.31 Furthermore,
nanoPAA-ZnCl2-AuLs composite as SERS substrate has more
advantages such as great stability, uniformity, and reproducibility.

In this paper, based on the self-made nanoPAA-ZnCl2-AuLs
substrate, the compaction of DNA under the action of cetyl trimethyl
ammonium bromide (CTAB) and the decompaction of DNA–CTAB complex
under the action of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) were investigated
by SERS. In addition, UV–visible spectrophotometry is also
employed to expound the mechanism of action of DNA compaction/decompaction
as a reference.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
Both CTAB (impurities ≤
0.001% and assay ≥ 99%) and SDS (assay ≥ 98.5%), linear
surfactant molecules, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Corporation,
and their purity are analytical grade. Calf thymus DNA (ctDNA) was
also purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Corporation. It can be found that
the ratios of the absorption of the ctDNA solutions at 260–280
nm were more than 1.8, indicating proteins were absent. R6G was purchased
from Aladdin Industrial Corporation.

During experiments, samples
of ctDNA and surfactants were prepared at room temperature. ctDNA
solutions were kept at a fixed concentration, that is, 10–7 M. According to different ratio, for example, CCTAB/CDNA = 5, various amounts
of surfactants were mixed with DNA molecules in sample cells.

2.2 nanoPAA-ZnCl2-AuLs Solid-Stated
Substrates
The preparation process of nanoPAA-ZnCl2-AuLs solid-stated substrates is described as shown in Figure 1A. First, nanoPAA membranes
were made with standard two-step anodic oxidation method. Second,
several drops of ZnCl2 solution with the concentration
of 0.001 M were added onto the template. After that, the samples were
stored at a certain temperature of 25 °C for 7 days. Then, ZnCl2 nanofilm was self-organized on the top surface of nanoPAA
membrane. Finally, a gold layer with thickness of ca. 25 nm was deposited
on the top surface by vacuum thermal evaporator and then sprinkled
a layer of gold nanoparticles with 50 nm diameter.

of the preparation process; (B) top surface of the nanoPAA membrane;
(C) nanoPAA-ZnCl2 composite film, the dotted ellipse marks
the nanoPAA; (D) nanoPAA-ZnCl2-AuL composite film.

Figure 1B shows
a typical scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of nanoPAA membrane. Figure 1C displays the substrate
of nanoPAA-ZnCl2 composite film, in which the nanoPAA membrane
marked with dotted ellipse can be clearly observed. Figure 1D shows a SEM image of nanoPAA-ZnCl2 coated by 25 nm Au layer. During experiments, the nanoPAA-ZnCl2-AuLs substrate was fixed on a clean glass slides first, and
then a certain amount of sample solution was transferred onto the
solid substrate by a transfer liquid gun.

R6G, one of the most
commonly used probe molecules, was employed
to determine SERS enhancement factors (EFs) and reproducibility of
the substrate because of its high adsorption energy yielding Raman
enhancement.

About the SERS EFs, the spectra of 10–9 M and
100 mM R6G were collected on the nanoPAA-ZnCl2-AuLs substrate
and the quartz slide (Figure S2), respectively.
After a simple calculation, the EF of the SERS-active substrate was
9.18 × 107 at a Raman shift of 1313 cm–1.

For reproducibility of nanoPAA-ZnCl2-AuLs substrates,
the SERS spectra of 10–9 M R6G were measured at
9 differently located spots randomly under the same conditions (Figure S3). Experimental data revealed that all
the deviations are less than 20%, indicating the substrate has good
reproducibility and is suitable for SERS applications.

2.3 Characterization
The SERS spectra
were measured by an confocal Raman microscopy system (Alpha 500R,
WITec, Germany) with a 532 nm laser sources (here, only used for the
Raman spectrum of DNA fiber), 633 nm (beam size about ca. 1 μm,
objective with 20×), and a EMCCD (UHTS 300). SERS spectra were
collected with the Raman shifts ranging from 0 to 2750 cm–1 with a 600 g mm–1 grating. The spectra were processed
by WITec Project Four software.

The SERS spectra of ctDNA, CTAB,
SDS, DNA–CTAB complex solution, and DNA–CTAB–SDS
complex solution were separately detected on different pieces cut
from an identical substrate. After a 10 μL droplet of solution
was dripped onto the surface of the substrate and was dried at room
temperature, molecules were completely adsorbed for SERS measurements.

In addition, UV–vis spectrophotometry (DS-11, DeNovix, USA)
was used to collect the spectra of UV absorption of the sample solution.
The spectra were recorded in a range of wavelength from 220 to 350
nm.

For the DNA molecule compaction, a series of CTAB were added
into
the DNA solutions with different concentration ratios of CTAB to DNA
of 0, 0.1, 1, 3, 5, 8, 100, and 1000. About 3 μL of DNA–CTAB
complex solution was taken for UV absorption spectrum after cultivated
for 24 h. As for the DNA molecule decompaction, SDS surfactants were
added into the DNA–CTAB complex with different concentration
ratios of SDS to CTAB of 0, 0.02, 0.2, 1, and 20. About 3 μL
of DNA–CTAB–SDS solution was taken for UV absorption
spectrum after cultivated for 24 h.

3 Results
and Discussion
Based on the self-made nanoPAA-ZnCl2-AuLs substrates,
both the compression of ctDNA molecules caused by surfactant CTAB
and the decompression of ctDNA molecules caused by surfactant SDS
were investigated by SERS technology under room temperature. All of
the following measurements were repeated more than 3 times.

3.1 SERS Spectra
3.1.1 ctDNA Molecule
Figure 2 displays
Raman spectra of
ctDNA molecules. Figure 2A shows typical Raman spectrum of ctDNA fiber and SERS spectrum of
ctDNA solution with concentration of 10–8 M; Figure 2B shows SERS spectrum
of ctDNA molecule with a low concentration of 10–9 M, the illustration in the upper left corner is the chemical molecular
structure of ctDNA molecule.

Figure 2 (A) Raman spectrum of ctDNA fiber and SERS spectrum
of ctDNA solution
(10–8 M); and (B) SERS spectrum of ctDNA solution
(10–9 M), the inset is the molecular structure of
ctDNA.

From Figure 2A,
it can be observed clearly that the main characteristic Raman peaks
of ctDNA are at 673, 733, 784, 807, 980, 1013, 1092, 1106, 1156, 1183,
1251, 1304, 1336, 1381, 1422, 1470, 1485, 1510, and 1570 cm–1. These characteristic peaks reveal structural information of DNA
molecule illustrated as follows.32−34 The bands at 673 cm–1 is assigned to thymine (T), and the 733 cm–1 is assigned to the symmetric stretching vibration of adenine (A).
The 784 cm–1 is related to the symmetric stretching
vibration of phosphodiester O–P–O. The 807 cm–1 is designated as the main chain vibration mode of the phosphate.
The 980 cm–1 is assigned to deoxyribose. The 1013
cm–1 is the contribution of C–O stretching
vibration of deoxyribose. The 1092 cm–1 is attributed
to the symmetric stretching vibration of O=P=O in PO2–. The 1106 cm–1 is attributed
to the stretching vibration of O–P–O in the phosphate.
The band at 1156 cm–1 is attributed to the phosphate
skeleton vibration mode, the band at 1183 cm–1 is
assigned to C–N stretching outside the base, and the band at
1251 cm–1 is attributed to adenine (A) and cytosine
(C). The bands at 1304, 1336, and 1510 cm–1 are
all attributed to the vibration of adenine (A). The 1381 cm–1 is assigned to thymine (T), adenine (A), and guanine (G), while
the bands at 1422, 1470, 1485, and 1570 cm–1 are
attributed to adenine (A) and guanine (G). It can be noted that the
SERS intensity of 10–8 M DNA solution at 1323, 1381,
1470, 1485, and 1570 cm–1 are significantly increased
compared with the rest of the bands. These bands are attributed to
the characteristic peaks of bases and deoxyribose. These characteristic
Raman peaks are usually undetectable when the concentration of DNA
solution is extremely low, reaching the level of a single molecule.
Under the effect of hotspots, the SERS intensity of DNA molecule is
considerably increased.

In Figure 2B, the
concentration of ctDNA solution was decreased to 10–9 M. the SERS intensity at 1510 cm–1 is significantly
increased compared with the rest of the bands in 10–9 M ctDNA solution. It has been proved that spectral quality and reproducibility
may be severely influenced by the large changes of the conformation
of DNA molecules and/or the bulk density of DNA molecules on the substrate
in previous studies.35 The vibration mode
of the adsorbed molecule has a large polarization component perpendicular
to the SERS substrate,36 which results
in efficient enhancement of the Raman peaks. The strong intensity
enhancement of peak at 1510 cm–1 can be assigned
to the orientation of the adenine (A) ring plane of the ctDNA molecule
that maybe perpendicular to the Au surfaces.37 Therefore, it can be deduced that DNA molecules are absorbed on
the substrate surface via the chemisorption of adenine (A).

3.1.2 Surfactant CTAB
CTAB is a typical
cationic surfactant with good coordination with anionic, nonionic,
and amphoteric surfactants. It is an amphiphilic molecular system
with a hydrophobic chain at one end and a hydrophilic polar head at
the other end. Generally, the hydrophilic polar head is defined as
the CTAB head, and the hydrophobic chain is defined as the CTAB tail.
Some research groups38 have studied the
conformational changes of DNA molecules caused by CTAB with various
techniques. However, the detailed mechanism and the sites acting on
DNA molecules are still not fully understood.

Figure 3 shows Raman spectra of CTAB
surfactant. Figure 3A shows a typical Raman spectrum of the CTAB powder and SERS spectrum
of CTAB solution with a concentration of 10–8 M; Figure 3B shows SERS spectrum
of CTAB molecule solution with a lower concentration of 10–9 M, the illustration in the upper left corner is the chemical molecular
structure of CTAB.

Figure 3 (A) Raman spectrum of CTAB powder and SERS spectrum of
CTAB solution
(10–8 M); and (B) SERS spectrum of CTAB solution
(10–9 M), the inset is the molecular structure of
CTAB.

From Figure 3A,
it can be seen clearly that the characteristic Raman peaks of CTAB
mainly appear at 758, 830, 901, 942, 957, 1013, 1063, 1125, 1146,
1164, 1212, 1267, 1291, 1393, 1435, 1460 cm–1, and
so forth. These characteristic peaks can reflect structural information
of CTAB molecular illustrated as follows.39−42 The 758 cm–1 is attributed to methyl rocking vibration from the (CH3)3N+ group. The bands at 830 cm–1 corresponds to the CH3 deformation. The 901, 942, and
957 cm–1 bands probably correspond to methyl rocking
vibration from the (CH3)3N+ group
and C–N+ stretching modes. The bands at 1013, 1063,
and 1125 cm–1 are attributed to the C–C stretching
vibration. The 1146 cm–1 band is assignable to C–C
antisymmetric stretch. The band at 1164 cm–1 has
its origin in the CH2 rocking mode, and the 1212 cm–1 is attributed to the CH2 wag vibration.
The strongest line at 1267 cm–1 is assigned to the
δ(C–H) vibrations of the −CH2–N+(CH3)3 group. The 1291 cm–1 is assigned to the CH2 twisting, while the bands at 1393
cm–1 is assigned to the wag vibration of CH2 and the deformation vibration of CH3. The band
at 1435 cm–1 is attributed to CH2 bending
vibration, and the 1460 cm–1 is assigned to CH2 scissors. It can be noted that there are new bands at 1478
and 1526 cm–1, and the SERS intensity at of bands
1212, 1304, 1435, and 1460 cm–1 are significantly
increased compared with the rest of the bands in 10–8 M CTAB solution. Except for the case of 1526 cm–1, which can be assigned to the bending of methyl group in (CH3)3N+ group, the rest are characteristic
peaks of CH2 in the structure.

In Figure 3B, the
SERS bands of 10–9 M CTAB solution are the same
as most bands shown in Figure 3A, while there is a new Raman peak at 1027 cm –1 related to C–C band. In addition, the SERS intensity of at
942, 962, 1164, 1267, and 1526 cm–1 are significantly
increased compared with the rest of the bands in 10–9 M CTAB solution. The sharply enhancement at 942, 962, 1267, and
1526 cm–1 can be attributed to the methyl groups
of the head group adsorbed well on the gold surface. The reason of
the strongest increase at 1267 cm–1 band is that
the orientation of the C–H vibrations of the −CH2–N+(CH3)3 group is
consistent with the polarization direction of the incident light.42 The reason of the band blue-shifted to
962 from 957 cm–1 is the chemical adsorption
of the methyl groups from the (CH3)3N+ group to the substrate. The enhancements of CH2 at 1164
cm–1 and C–C at 1027 cm–1 are also assigned to the alkane chain being close to the substrate
surface. The main reason of these bands of blue-shifted to 1072, 1304,
and 1403 cm–1, is the chemical adsorption of CH2 to the substrate. So, during experiments, both the head methyl
groups and the hydrocarbon chain of CTAB are near the hot spot of
substrate surface.39

3.1.3 Surfactant SDS
SDS is another typical
sensitive anionic surfactant. It is an amphiphilic molecular system
with hydrophilicity at one end and hydrophobic chain at the other
end. The hydrophilic polarity head is defined as the SDS head, while
the hydrophobic chain is defined as the SDS tail. SDS can bind to
CTAB and destroy the combination of CTAB and DNA to study the decompression
of DNA molecules.

Figure 4 is the Raman spectra of SDS. Figure 4A shows a typical Raman spectrum of SDS powder
and SERS spectrum of SDS solution with a concentration of 10–8 M; Figure 4B shows
SERS spectrum of SDS solution with a low concentration of 10–9 M, the illustration in the upper left corner is the chemical molecular
structure of SDS.

Figure 4 (A) Raman spectrum of SDS powder and SERS spectrum of
SDS solution
(10–8 M); and (B) SERS spectrum of SDS solution
(10–9 M), the inset is the molecular structure of
SDS.

From Figure 4A,
it can be seen clearly that the characteristic Raman peaks of SDS
mainly are at 687, 830, 895, 995, 1060, 1081, 1125, 1217, 1300, 1321,
1365, 1437, 1454, 1478, 1537 cm–1, and so forth.
These characteristic peaks reveal abundant structural information
of SDS molecular illustrated as follows.43−46 The bands 687 cm–1 belonged to an SO3 vibration. The 830 cm–1 belonged to CO–SO3 stretching vibration. The 895
cm–1 is attributed to CH3 rocking, and
the 995 cm–1 is attributed to the stretching vibration
of S–OC. The 1060 cm–1 is assigned to the
full-reflex vibration of the C–C skeleton and may be mixed
with SO3 vibration, and the 1081 cm–1 is attributed to twist mode of the C–C skeleton and may be
mixed with SO3 vibration. The band at 1125 cm–1 is attributed to the full-reflex vibration of the C–C skeleton,
and the 1217 cm–1 is a characteristic of the S=O
bond. The 1300 and 1321 cm–1 are assigned to the
CH2 twist. The SERS feature at 1365 cm–1 can be attributed to the CH2 wag and the band at 1437,
1454, and 1478 cm–1 are attributed to the CH2 bending modes. The 1537 cm–1 is attributed
to CH2 rocking vibration. It can be noted that there is
a new Raman peak at 1578 cm–1, and the SERS intensity
of 10–8 M SDS solution at 1321, 1365, and 1478 cm–1 are greatly increased compared with the rest bands,
these bands are characteristic peaks of CH2.

In Figure 4B, the
SERS bands of 10–9 M SDS are the same as the most
bands shown in Figure 4A, except for the appearance of a new band at 736 cm–1 and the intensity increase of the peaks at 1217, 1370, 1478, and
1578 cm–1 compared with the rest of the bands. The
significantly enhanced 1217 cm–1 is one characteristic
peak of the head group, and the main reason of great enhancement of
1217 cm–1 is that the vibration of S=O bond
has a large polarization component perpendicular to the SERS substrate.
The band blue-shift to 1370 from 1365 cm–1 can be
assigned to the CH2 of the chain interacted with the gold
surface. The characteristic peaks of CH2 at 736, 1370,
1478, and 1578 cm–1 are also enhanced, and the main
reason is that the alkane chain is close to the surface. From these
stretching modes and vibrational modes of the OSO3 moiety
and CH2, it can be inferred that the SDS is absorbed on
the gold surface, and both the polar head and the nonpolar hydrocarbon
chain are close to the gold surface with the CH2.

3.1.4 Composite of ctDNA–CTAB
Figure 5 is the information
of the composite of ctDNA–CTAB. Figure 5A shows the SERS spectrum of a ctDNA–CTAB
composite, in which the black and blue characteristic numbers represent
the wavenumbers of DNA and CTAB, respectively. The concentration of
DNA molecules is 1 × 10–9 M. Figure 5B is a schematic diagram of
the ctDNA molecule in the compaction state induced by surfactant CTAB.

Figure 5 Composite
of ctDNA–CTAB. (A) SERS spectrum, black and blue
characters represent the wave number of DNA and CTAB, respectively;
(B) schematic diagram of a ctDNA molecule under compaction state induced
by CTAB.

From Figure 5A,
some characteristic peaks of DNA and CTAB can be clearly observed.
For example, for the DNA molecules, bands are at 653, 807, 1092, 1106,
and 1422 cm–1. The band at 653 cm–1 is attributable to deoxyribose, the band at 807 cm–1 is designated as symmetrical vibration mode of O–P–O
phosphate backbone, the band at 1092 cm–1 is attributed
to the symmetric stretching vibration of O=P=O in PO2–, the 1106 cm–1 is attributed
to the stretching vibration of O–P–O in the phosphate,
and the 1422 cm–1 band is attributed to the bending
vibration of the CH2 group of deoxyribose. While, for the
CTAB, some characteristic peaks are also observed at 758, 962, 1027,
1146, 1164, 1212, 1304, 1446, and 1478 cm–1. The
bands at 758 and 962 cm–1 belong to methyl rocking
from the (CH3)3N+ group, the 1027
cm–1 is assigned to C–C stretching vibration,
the 1146 cm–1 is assignable to C–C anti-symmetric
stretch, the band at 1164 cm–1 belongs to the CH2 rocking, the 1212 cm–1 can be attributed
to CH2 wag, the 1304 cm–1 is related
to the CH2 twisting, the 1446 cm–1 is
attributed to CH2 bending vibration, and the 1478 cm–1 is related to the CH2 scissors.

Comparing the characteristic peak of ctDNA molecules shown in Figure 5A with that shown
in Figure 2B, it can
be found that: (1) the number of characteristic peaks of DNA molecules
are less in Figure 5A. Both the phosphate group at 807, 1092, and 1106 cm–1 and the deoxyribose at 1422 cm–1 are observed,
while the characteristic peak of the base disappears, which indicates
that the DNA molecule has been compressed from the free state and
some components like the base was hidden and undetectable. (2) When
DNA molecules are free (Figure 2B), the peak intensity ratio of the phosphate group to the
deoxyribose is I1092/I1422 = 6.86, while it is I1092/I1422 = 0.42 as DNA molecules are in
compaction state of DNA–CTAB (Figure 5A). The ratio of DNA phosphoric acid to deoxyribose
reduces by about 16 times in the compressed state, indicating that
the action of the phosphate group with the substrate is weakened because
the phosphate group is further away from the hot spot in the substrate.
It can be inferred that the ctDNA molecule are tightly packed by CTAB.

Furthermore, comparing the characteristic peaks of CTAB shown in Figure 5A with that shown
in Figure 3B, it can
be observed that (1) the characteristic peaks of CTAB, both the head
group and the hydrophobic tail, are all appeared. The peak intensity
of hydrocarbon chains at 1212, 1446, and 1478 cm–1 are enhanced compared with the rest bands, indicating the number
of hydrocarbon chains increase sharply at the hot spot of the substrate.
The band blue-shift to 1446 from 1435 cm–1 suggests
that CH2 in hydrocarbon chain exposed to the hot spot interact
with the surface of the substrate by chemical adsorption. (2) The
peak intensity ratio of the head group to the hydrocarbon chain is I962/I1027 = 2.22
in the pure CTAB, while it is I962/I1027 = 0.69 in the DNA–CTAB complex.
The ratio reduces about 3 times in the DNA–CTAB complex, which
reveals that the action of the head with the substrate is sharply
reduced. According to the essences of peak intensity of SERS spectrum,
it can be concluded that the number of the head group interacting
with the substrate decreases greatly because the head group leaves
the substrate surface to bind to the phosphoric acid by the electrostatic
effect. This point is also corroborated by the disappearance of the
1267 cm–1 of the Raman characteristic peaks of CTAB
head.

The process of surfactant CTAB interacting with DNA molecules
to
compress DNA can be described as following: at first, the head of
CTAB combine with the phosphate group of the DNA, and then, the hydrophobic
interaction among the CTAB hydrocarbon chains bring about the bending
of DNA molecules to achieve a tightly compaction conformation. CTAB
wrap around the compressed DNA molecules, hydrocarbon chains is exposed
to the outside.

3.1.5 Composite of DNA–CTAB–SDS
Figure 6 shows the
composite of ctDNA–CTAB–SDS. Figure 6A is the SERS spectra of ctDNA–CTAB–SDS
composite, in which the black, blue, and red character numbers represent
the wavenumber of DNA, CTAB, and SDS, respectively. The concentration
of DNA molecules is 1 × 10–9 M. Figure 6B is a schematic diagram of
composite ctDNA–CTAB–SDS in the decompaction state that
DNA is decompressed from the ctDNA–CTAB compaction to a free
state induced by the action of surfactant SDS.

Figure 6 Composite of ctDNA–CTAB–SDS:
(A) SERS spectra of
composite ctDNA–CTAB–SDS, black, blue, and red characters
represent the DNA, CTAB, and SDS, respectively; (B) schematic diagram
of ctDNA–CTAB–SDS in decompaction state.

From Figure 6A,
some characteristic peaks of DNA, CTAB, and SDS can be clearly observed.
(1) Bands at 697, 733, 784, 980, 1092, 1251, 1510, and 1570 cm–1 are all related to the ctDNA molecules. The band
at 697 and 980 cm–1 are attributable to deoxyribose.
The band at 733 cm–1 is attributed to the symmetric
stretching vibration of adenine (A). The 784 cm–1 is related to the symmetric stretching of phosphodiester O–P–O.
The band at 1092 cm–1 is attributed to the symmetric
stretching vibration of O=P=O in PO2–. The 1251 cm–1 is because of adenine
(A) and cytosine (C), and the 1510 cm–1 is assigned
to adenine (A). The 1570 cm–1 is related to adenine
(A) and guanine (G). (2) There are Raman characteristic features of
CTAB, for example, 758, 942, 1027, 1072, 1125, 1403, 1435, and 1526
cm–1. As mentioned above, the band at 758 and 1526
cm–1 are assigned to CH3 rocking from
N+(CH3)3 group. The 942 cm–1 is derived from the methyl rocking of the (CH3)3N+ group and C–N+ stretching mode. The
band at 1027, 1072, and 1125 cm–1 are assigned to
the C–C stretching vibration. The 1403 cm–1 is attributed to CH2 wag and CH3 deformation.
The 1435 cm–1 is attributed to CH2 bending
vibration. (3) The characteristic peaks of SDS at 895, 1125, 1217,
1370, 1478, and 1578 cm–1 can also be found. It
is known that the 895 cm–1 is assigned to CH3 rocking vibration, the band at 1125 cm–1 belongs to C–C stretching vibration, the 1217 cm–1 band is a characteristic of the S=O bond, the 1370 cm–1 is attributed to the CH2 wag, and the
1478 cm–1 is attributed to the CH2 bending.
The 1578 cm–1 is assigned to CH2 rocking
vibration.

Analyzing the SERS characteristic spectra can provide
us an insight
into the effects of surfactant CTAB–SDS on the compaction and
decompaction of DNA molecules at the single molecule level. (1) In Figure 6A, there are characteristic
peaks of the deoxyribose at 980 cm–1 and phosphate
groups at 784 and 1092 cm–1, and bases of DNA molecule
at 733, 1251, 1510, and 1570 cm–1. The main components
of the DNA molecule are exposed and can be detected, which indicate
that the DNA molecule has been decompressed from the compaction state.
(2) The intensity at 1570 cm–1 is enhanced greatly
compared with the rest peaks of ctDNA molecule in Figure 6A, which indicates that the
adenine (A) ring plane might be perpendicular to the surface of substrate
and interact with it. Thus, the DNA molecule is close to the substrate
surface by adenine (A). (3) The peak intensity ratio of the base to
the phosphate group is I1251/I1092 = 0.87 in Figure 2B, while it is I1251/I1092 = 0.86 after the SDS decompressed the ctDNA–CTAB
complex in Figure 6A. The ratio is barely changed, revealing that the configuration
of DNA molecule are basically recovered to the original state, but
the DNA molecules in the decompaction state can no longer have the
same conformation as the original one. (4) Compared with the SERS
spectrum of CTAB solution in Figure 3B, characteristic peaks of the head group at 758, 942,
and 1526 cm–1 and the hydrocarbon chain at 1027,
1072, 1125, 1403, and 1435 cm–1 still exist in a
complex state of DNA–CTAB–SDS shown in Figure 6A. It can be observed that
the peak intensity of the hydrophobic chain at 1403 cm–1 is enhanced compared with the rest bands in Figure 6A, which can be attributed to the chemical
adsorption of CH2 and CH3 to the SERS substrate.
About the characteristic Raman pattern of CTAB, in Figure 3B the peak intensity ratio
of the head to the hydrocarbon chain is I1526/I1072 = 2.04, while it is I1526/I1072 = 1.62 after the
SDS decompressed the ctDNA–CTAB complex. The ratio is reduced
by 1.3 times, indicating the effect of CTAB head group interacting
with the substrate is weakened slightly but still in close proximity
to the substrate, while the CH2 of the hydrocarbon chain
still interacts with the substrate surface. (5) Compared with the
SERS spectrum of SDS solution in Figure 4B, characteristic peaks of the head group
at 895 and 1217 cm–1 and the hydrocarbon chain at
1370, 1478, and 1578 cm–1 still exist in a complex
state of DNA–CTAB–SDS shown in Figure 6A. The peak intensity ratio of the head to
the hydrocarbon chain is I1217/I1478 = 0.81 in pure SDS solution, while it is I1217/I1478 = 0.72
after the SDS decompressed the DNA–CTAB complex, which indicates
that the action of the head and the tail with the SERS substrate are
not significantly changed.  (6) Combined with (4) and (5), it
can be concluded that the negative head of SDS neutralize the positive
head of CTAB when SDS interact with the complex DNA–CTAB composite,
and the interaction not only disbands the DNA from the DNA–CTAB
compaction state to a decompaction state, but also lead to the head
group of CTAB no longer directly acting on the substrate. From Figure 6A, it should also
be noted that the peak intensity at 1125 cm–1 and
the C–C bond in both CTAB and SDS, is significantly enhanced,
which can be assigned to the part of C–C chain being perpendicular
to the solid surface of the SERS substrate. After SDS combined with
CTAB by electrostatic and hydrophobic, their head group and hydrocarbon
chain interact with the SERS substrate, and the part of C–C
chains in CTAB and SDS are vertical to the substrate.

The decompaction
process of DNA after adding surfactant SDS can
be described as follows: at first, the compacted conformation of DNA–CTAB
complex is destroyed by SDS combining with CTAB through electrostatic
and hydrophobic bonding; then, the DNA is released from the DNA–CTAB
complex and extended by the electrostatic repulsion of the phosphate
group. The DNA molecule is decompressed but cannot have the original
conformation.

3.2 UV–Vis Spectra
To characterize
the internal construction of DNA–CTAB compaction and DNA–CTAB–SDS
decompaction, the ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy (UV–vis)
technology was employed. UV–vis, an ultraviolet–visible
absorption spectrum, belongs to the electronic spectrum, and is generated
by the transition of valence electrons.47 The ultraviolet visible spectrum and the degree of absorption, produced
by the absorption of ultraviolet and visible light from molecules
or ions of a sample, can be determined and inferred for the composition
and structure of the sample. Generally, the technique measures the
absorption of light across the ultraviolet and visible light wavelengths
through a liquid sample. With a constant light path length and known
absorption coefficient, the concentration of a compound in question
can be determined from the light absorbed by the sample according
to the Beer–Lambert’s law: , where a is the absorbance
of the solution, ε is the molar absorptivity, l is the thickness, and c is the concentration.

3.2.1 UV–Vis Spectra of DNA–CTAB
Compaction
There is strong absorption of DNA in a range of
wavelength from 240 to 290 nm. The maximum absorption peak at 260
nm is caused by its conjugated double bond in the nucleotide bases.
To determine the relationship between the amount of cationic surfactant
CTAB and DNA molecules in the compacted/decompacted state, the absorption
spectra of DNA molecules interacted with CTAB at various concentration
ratios are systematically investigated. As shown in Figure 7, the DNA concentration is
10–7 M; while, the CTAB concentrations are 0, 10–8, 10–7, 3 × 10–7, 5 × 10–7, 8 × 10–7, 10–5, and 10–4 M, respectively.

Figure 7 (A) Absorption
spectra of DNA molecules in compacted state under
the action of cationic CTAB at different concentrations; (B) absorption
peak values of DNA–CTAB complex around 260 nm at various CCTAB; the connecting line is just to guide the
eyes.

Figure 7A shows
the absorption spectra of DNA–CTAB complex at different concentrations. Figure 7B displays the absorbance
of DNA–CTAB at 260 nm changing with different concentrations
of CTAB (CCTAB). It can be observed clearly
from Figure 7B, the
absorbance of DNA decreases first and then increases with increasing
CTAB concentration, and the absorption nadir is the CCTAB = 5 × 10–7 M. That is, as
the CCTAB increases, the absorption value
decreases when CCTAB < 5 × 10–7 M, which indicates that the DNA molecules are gradually
compressed, both the number of DNA directly exposed and the total
area of DNA exposed gradually reduce; when the CCTAB = 5 × 10–7 M, DNA molecule is under
the most compressed state; when the CCTAB > 5 × 10–7 M, the absorbance has an apparently
increase, which reveals the DNA–CTAB complexes are decompressed
as an excessive amount of CTAB interacting with them; when the CTAB
concentration is about 10–4 M, the absorbance is
similar to the value of the DNA solution without CTAB. At this time,
all DNA molecules are under completely decompaction state.

3.2.2 UV–Vis Spectra of DNA–CTAB
with SDS
DNA molecules can be decompressed when anionic surfactant
SDS is added into the DNA–CTAB complex. As shown in Figure 8, the SDS concentrations
are respectively 0, 10–8, 10–7, 5 × 10–7, and 10–5 M.
For comparison, the absorption spectra without SDS is also provided.

Figure 8 (A) Absorption
spectra of DNA–CTAB complexes in decompaction
state with added anionic surfactant SDS at different concentrations
and (B) absorption peak values of DNA–CTAB complex solutions
at various CSDS around 260 nm, the connecting
line is just to guide the eyes.

Figure 8A displays
the absorption spectra of the ctDNA–CTAB complex when surfactant
SDS is added to the solution. Figure 8B shows the tendency of the absorbance at 260 nm with
the concentration of SDS (CSDS). It can
be seen from Figure 8B that the absorbance at 260 nm first rises and then stabilizes with CSDS increasing, and the threshold value of CSDS = 10–7 M. That is, when CSDS < 10–7 M, the absorption
peak gradually increases with the increasing of CSDS, indicating the concentration of SDS is insufficient
enough to break down the DNA–CTAB complex, that is, the amount
of anionic SDS is not large enough to neutralize the cationic CTAB.
The absorbance gradually increases with the increase of CSDS, indicating that DNA–CTAB complex is gradually
decompressed. When CSDS > 10–7 M, the absorbance of solution is near to that of the pure DNA solution,
which indicates the DNA is fully released from the DNA–CTAB
compressed state. Furthermore, as the SDS concentration continues
to increase, there is no significant change in the absorption value
at 260 nm, indicating that the addition of excessive SDS has little
effect on the absorption of DNA in the decompaction state.

From Figures 7 and 8, it can be deduced that both the excessive cationic
CTAB and the anionic SDS could lead to the decompaction of the DNA–CTAB
complex.

3.3 Mechanism of Interaction
Figure 9 is a schematic
diagram
of ctDNA molecule compaction and decompaction induced by surfactants
of cationic CTAB and anionic SDS.

Figure 9 Schematic diagram of DNA molecule compaction
under surfactant CTAB
and decompaction interacted with surfactants of SDS or CTAB.

The compaction process of ctDNA molecules interacted
with surfactant
CTAB can be described as following: positively charged CTA+ ions (i.e. head of CTAB) approach and bind to the negatively charged
binding site of DNA (phosphate group) by electrostatic action. The
hydrophobic action of the CTAB hydrophobic chains results in the double
helix DNA bend, shrink, and even compaction. The decompaction of DNA–CTAB
is induced by two ways, one is the interaction with surfactant SDS
and the other is the effect of excess surfactant CTAB. As for the
former, because of the strong electrostatic ion pairing and hydrophobic
effect between the anionic SDS and cationic CTAB, CTAB is detached
from the DNA–CTAB compressed complex to interact with SDS,
causing the DNA molecules in the decompaction state. With regard to
the latter, the hydrophobic tail of the excessive free CTAB acts on
the DNA–CTAB complex to form micelles by the similar compatible
principle when the concentration of CTAB is further increased, which
results in the separation of CTAB from the DNA–CTAB compaction
state and the release of DNA molecule.

4 Conclusions
To understand the mechanism of DNA molecular compaction/decompaction
is very meaningful for life sciences and biomedicine. In this paper,
a sort of solid nanofilm of nanoPAA-ZnCl2-AuLs was prepared
by the standard two-step anodization method combined with self-assembly
method, which was with high sensitivity and reproducibility. The EF
of the SERS-active substrate was evaluated to be 9.18 × 107 at a Raman shift of 1313 cm–1. Then, based
on this novel solid substrate, SERS technique was used to study the
interaction between ctDNA molecules and surfactants (e.g., CTAB and
SDS) which resulted in the DNA molecule compaction and decompaction.
The SERS spectra of ctDNA, CTAB, and SDS were all obtained, even though
the sample concentration was as low as 10–9 M. The
SERS spectra of the compacted ctDNA–CTAB complex and the decompacted
DNA–CTAB–SDS with DNA concentration of 10–9 M were also obtained. For the compaction, it is found that the ratio
of DNA phosphoric acid to deoxyribose reduces by about 16 times in
the DNA–CTAB complex, and the characteristic peak of the base
disappears. In addition, the peak intensity ratio of the head group
to the hydrocarbon chain reduces about 3 times in the DNA–CTAB
complex, indicating that the DNA is compacted and the hydrophobic
chain of CTAB is exposed at the outermost layer. For the decompaction,
the characteristic peak components of the DNA molecule in a state
of decompression is the same as the natural state, the SDS peak intensity
ratio of the head to the hydrocarbon chain is not significantly changed,
and the CTAB peak intensity ratio of the head to the hydrocarbon chain
is reduced by 1.3 times, which indicates that the DNA is decompressed
but no longer has the original conformation, and the CTAB head is
not directly electrostatically adsorbed on the substrate but acts
on the substrate after electrostatic adsorption with the SDS. The
mechanism of DNA compression and decompression caused by surfactants
is that positively charged CTA+ ions bind to negatively
charged phosphate groups through electrostatic interaction and compress
DNA through hydrophobic interaction of hydrophobic chains. The combination
of strong electrostatic ion pairing and hydrophobic effect between
SDS and CTAB results in the release of DNA from the compacted state,
which is extended because of the mutual repulsion of phosphate groups
in the DNA skeleton. In addition, UV–visible spectrophotometry
was also employed to detect the compaction and decompaction under
different concentrations of the surfactant. When the concentration
ratio of CTAB to DNA is 5, the DNA was completely compressed, while
SDS (not less than 0.2 times of CTAB) or excess CTAB could bring the
DNA–CTAB complex to a decompressed state. The combination mode
of DNA with surfactant and the mechanism of DNA compaction and decompaction
are very practically helpful for the future research of DNA as drug
or gene carriers for disease treatment.
