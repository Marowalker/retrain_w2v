The trimetallic Fe/Al/Ti (1:1:1)
nanocomposite (FAT), synthesized
by an adaptable tuned chemical route, offers a new approach for water
treatment, for example, the de-fluoridation and photodegradation soluble
dye methylene blue (MB) at pH 7. FAT acted as a good fluoride scavenger
in the presence of other co-ions and within a widespread pH range
(pH 2–11). The photodegradation efficiencies were >90% for
different concentrations of MB solutions. The characterization of
FAT includes thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction, Fourier
transform-infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission
electron microscopy, and ζ-potential analysis. Furthermore,
the regeneration efficiencies of both the water treatments were checked,
where the removal efficiency was not hampered significantly even after
five batches. Spectroscopic techniques were adopted to perform the
kinetic studies and to propose the probable mechanistic paths.

1 Introduction
Industrial
activities contaminate water reservoirs with hazardous
chemicals, like heavy metals (Pb2+, Cd2+),1 dyes,2 fluoride, and
so forth.3 Fluoride (F–) contamination of drinking water is becoming a global problem for
the modern world4 besides the release of
carcinogenic dyes from textile industries also affecting human and
aquatic life.5 The World Health Organization
(WHO) made a guideline of 1.5 mg/L fluoride level for drinking water
as intake of excess fluoride-containing drinking water affects human
health5 and one-third of the 1.26 billion
Indian population is in danger of fluorosis (>2 mg/L).6 Several techniques have been developed for de-fluoridation,
such as precipitation,7 membrane-based
electrodialysis processes,8 adsorption,9 and so forth, among which adsorption is the most
promising.10 Previously activated alumina,11 activated carbon,12 and bone char13 were used. Various metal
oxides have been confirmed to have an excellent affinity to fluoride
adsorption, such as the oxides of Fe,14 Ti,15 Al,16 Zr,17 Mg,18 and their bimetallic compositions.19,20

For
the purpose of detoxification of industrial colored wastes,
several techniques like adsorption,21 precipitation,
sedimentation, ion-exchange processes,22 and biological treatments23 were adopted;
however, photocatalytic degradation with nanoparticles is a well accepted
process.24 V-doped Mn3O4 nanoparticles were able to degrade methylene blue (MB) in
the presence of H2O2 at pH 10 photo-catalytically.25 Ahmed et al. were able to degrade MB photo-catalytically
using Fe2O3/TiO2 nanoparticles.24

Among the adsorbents for fluoride removal,
activated alumina is
the most used as it is commonly available and inexpensive,26 but its high adsorption is exhibited at low
pH ranges, which eventually promotes dissolution of aluminum.27 In this communication, the 3d transition metal
oxides (Fe2O3 and TiO2) were modified
with the Al3+ trivalent cation to form 1:1:1 trimetallic
oxide for the de-fluoridation and photodegradation process as Al3+ enhances the efficiencies of Fe3+ and Ti4+ in bimetallic systems.28,29 Various techniques
for the development of metal oxides were applied, such as the impregnation
method,30 solid-state dispersion, sol–gel
method,31 hydrothermal method,32 mechanical mixing method, co-precipitation method,
flame spray pyrolysis, photo-deposition method, and so forth.33 These methods have some disadvantages, for example,
prolonged reaction time, difficult procedures, high temperature, specialized
instruments, toxic reagents, external additives, and so forth. Among
the various preparation ways, solution combustion synthesis is an
efficient, economically favored, and homogeneous method for preparing
various metal oxides.34 A simple chemical
method to synthesize nanoparticles is the formation of a precursor
mass through solution combustion synthesis using a fuel (urea, glycine,
oxalyl dihydrate)33 with the constituent
metal nitrates. This process has some advantages, for example, self-sustained
reaction in homogeneous solution, simple equipment, time and energy
consuming, and molecular level mixing, and also the product composition
can be tuned.35,36

The efficient trimetallic
Fe/Al/Ti (1:1:1) nano-oxide (abbreviated
as FAT) was synthesized by a simple solution combustion method using
the chelating ligand triethanolamine for the fluoride removal and
photocatalytic degradation of MB (C16H18ClN3S), IUPAC name: 3,7-bis(dimethylamino)-phenothiazin-5-ium
chloride, at neutral pH medium for the first time. Herein, the investigation
of fluoride adsorption with different initial F– concentrations, adsorbent dose in different time intervals along
with the photodegradation of different concentrations of MB with their
kinetic, thermodynamic, and mechanistic studies, was done. The pH
effects and interfering co-anions on the F– adsorption
process and the reuse abilities were also examined. We investigated
in order to confirm that this work is a novel cost-effective method
and has recycling ability for waste water treatment.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials Required
Chemicals used
during this work were NaF, Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, Al(NO3)3·9H2O, TiO2, HF, triethanolamine (abbreviated as TEA), tartaric acid,
MB, HNO3 and double distilled water. All the chemicals
were bought from Merck Specialties Limited, Mumbai, India.

2.2 Material Synthesis
2.2.1 Preparation of 0.05 M
Solution of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, Al(NO3)3·9H2O, Ti-Tartarate Solution
The
0.05 (M) solutions of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and Al(NO3)3·9H2O were prepared
by dissolving the required amount of corresponding metal salts into
1000 mL volumetric flasks using double distilled water, and to prepare
the Ti-tartarate solution [0.05 (M)], the standard process was adopted.37

2.2.2 Synthesis of FAT
All the required
chemicals were taken in a 1000 mL beaker in equimolar ratio, and the
standard procedure was adopted to prepare the precursor mass.35 After mechanical grinding, the precursor carbonaceous
mass was calcined at 900 °C for 4 h, nano-powders of FAT were
obtained as shown in the flow chart in Figure 1 and the mechanism of the formation of the
precursor mass is discussed in Figure S1.35

Figure 1 Synthetic procedure of nanosized FAT.

2.3 Analytical
Measurements
The concentration
of fluoride, pH studies, and other physical parameters was done using
Thermo Scientific (Orion Versa star Pro) Advance Electrochemistry
Meter (Software Revision: r4.06, serial number: V11855). The thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) for the precursor sample was done using PerkinElmer
STA 6000 at N2 atmosphere. UV–vis spectrophotometer
(PerkinElmer, LAMBDA 35) was used to measure the degradation of MB
and also for the UV–vis DRS study (diffused reflection spectra)
of FAT. The nano-powder was characterized by X-ray diffraction (Bruker
D8 ADVANCE eco), Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) with
scanning speed 2° 2θ/min and identified by standard JCPDS
file (76-1157). Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) (PerkinElmer
Spectrum model L1600300) was recorded in the range of 4000–450
cm–1 by the KBr pellet method (Merck Spectra grade,
Merck India Private Limited) for the characterization. Transmission
electron microscope (TEM) (JEM-ARM300F, USA, Inc.) was used for powdered
sample characterization. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Model
JSM 5800 JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) was used for the surface morphology and
other topographic information. The ζ -potential investigation
was done using Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS90 (United Kingdom).

2.4 Determination of Fluoride Ion Concentration
The ion-selective
electrode was used to determine F– level. TISAB(III)
(Orion 940911) was used to minimize the ionic
strength variation in the samples, and the cyclohexane diamine tetraacetic
acid buffer was used to mask the other interfering ions in aqueous
medium.

A calibration curve was obtained using NaF standard
solutions (Orion 940907) with different F– concentrations
of 1–10 ppm, which were mixed with TISAB(III) in 10:1 volumetric
ratio. The results were plotted as F– as a function
of concentration (ppm) versus potential (mV) to obtain the calibration
curve.

2.5 Preparation of Fluoride and Dye Solutions
Standard fluoride solution (1000 mL of 1000 ppm) was prepared by
dissolving the requisite amount of anhydrous NaF with double distilled
water, and from that, 3, 5, and 10 ppm fluoride solutions were prepared
and stock solutions of 1000 mL 10–5 (M) and 10–4 (M) MB were prepared by dissolving the appropriate
amount of the dye using double distilled water, and the physical parameters
were measured by the Thermo Scientific (Orion Versa star Pro) Advance
Electrochemistry Meter, as described in Table 1.

a Fluoride concentrations are expressed
in ppm, and MB concentrations are expressed in molar (M) unit.

For different F– solutions (3, 5, and 10 ppm),
different adsorbent doses (0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 g/100 mL) were varied
and shaken as per the standard procedure38 by varying the contact times from 30 to 60 min at 30 °C, pH
7. For the photodegradation, the MB solutions were irradiated in sunlight
with 1 mmol of FAT with 100 mL stock solution taken in a 250 mL beaker
with occasional stirring. The experiments were performed under ambient
condition between 11 am and 11:30 am (month of April, Purulia, West
Bengal, India) at a latitude and longitude of 23.3613° N, 86.3399°
E, respectively, with average solar intensity 6.08 kW h m–2.39 The photocatalytic experiments were
conducted simultaneously to avoid the error arising because of the
solar light fluctuation. Dye solutions (3 mL) were taken in regular
intervals, arresting the mixture for the kinetic studies up to 20
min (1200 s) and detected under UV–vis spectrophotometer. A
set without catalyst was also exposed to sunlight irradiation to ensure
the role of the photocatalyst.

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Characterization
TGA analysis for
the precursor sample was studied from 50 to 900 °C with heating
rate of 10 °C/min, as shown in Figure 2A. The thermal degradation of the prepared
black mass occurred in three stages, with a total mass loss of 68.19%.
In Stage I, the weight loss was because of physically and chemically
adsorbed water, which occurred up to ∼300 °C with 12.60%
of mass loss. The second weight loss with 49.50% happened between
330 and 670 °C, with the evolution of CO2, NH3, and nitrogenous oxide in Stage II, as described in Figure S1. In the final Stage III, that is, at
>670 °C, there was a gradual weight decrease, which indicated
complete volatilization of all the substances as mentioned in the
previous stages, the sample tended to reach its calcination temperature,
and the mass loss was 5.79%. It could be decided that the TG graph
tended to be parallel with the x-axis above 800 °C.
Thus, calcination was performed at 900 °C to get the desired
phase.

and (c) regenerated. (D) magnified FTIR studies of FAT. All samples
for (B,C) are produced after calcining at 900 °C, 4 h.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns
of FAT calcined at 900 °C
for 4 h is shown in Figure 2B. The XRD patterns were verified with the JCPDS data file
no. 76-1157. All of the diffraction peaks of FAT indicated orthorhombic
with Cmcm (63) S.G with a = 3.37
Å, b = 9.15 Å, and c =
10.58 Å and the unit cell volume was 326 Å3.
The heating rate and calcination time were carefully monitored. The
crystallite size was obtained as 30 nm using Scherrer’s method.38

The FTIR spectra of FAT calcined powder,
F– adsorbed
powder, and F– regenerated powder are shown in Figure 2C(a–c), respectively.
The broad peak observed at 3426 cm–1 is for the
vibration of −OH groups, hydrogen bonded with intermolecular
water molecules or the surface absorbed moisture.40 The peaks around 1630 cm–1 are designated
for the metal carbonyl stretching vibrations present in the samples.38 It was reported that the peaks observed from
1150 to 1170 cm–1 were those for mixed metal oxides
M–OH.41 The peaks observed at 617
and 1076 cm–1 were for the stretching vibrations
of Ti–O or O–Ti–O bond41 and Al–O bond,40 respectively,
as shown clearly in Figure 2D. After adsorption, the −OH group peak was shifted
and the intensity of the peak was slightly decreased. This was because
of the involvement of the fluoride adsorption. The peak intensity
decreased after fluoride adsorption, but after regeneration, it almost
merged with the pure sample, which indicated that the regeneration
process was done properly and assured that the adsorbents were fit
for batch studies without any adverse effect, as indicated in Figure 2C(c).

TEM studies
showed mostly spherical morphology with uniform distribution
of the particles, as indicated in Figure 3a. The black and white spots indicate focused
particles. The diameter of the particles ranged between 35 and 55
nm (Figure 3b), and
the average diameter was found to be 42.00 ± 0.50 nm with 30%
polydispersity, which was calculated by a UTI image tool software
(version 3.0).

(c) SEM
image of FAT calcined at 900 °C for 4 h.

The morphology of FAT was observed by SEM, as shown in Figure 3c. The topology was
very porous in nature, with average grain size 155 nm using UTI image
tool software (version 3.0). Larger grains are visible with porosity
indicated by the darker part of the micrograph.

3.2 Analytical Studies for Fluoride Adsorption
3.2.1 Fluoride Removal Efficiency
The
whole experiment was performed as described in Section 2.5, and the percentage of
fluoride removal was calculated using eq 1; the results are enlisted in Table 2. 1  where C0 and Cf (ppm) are the F– concentration
of the initial and the final state, respectively.

The effects of change in adsorbent dose at various
fluoride concentrations
at different contact times are illustrated in Figures S2–S4. It was observed that with increasing
concentration of pollutant (here F–), the percentage
removal efficiency of the pollutant increased, which seemed to be
opposite to the general trend. However, in this case, on increasing
F– concentration, more and more F– were available for adsorption onto the adsorbent competing with
OH– ions in solution. Similar types of observations
were previously reported elsewhere.6,9,47,48 From Table 2, it can be concluded that the
use of 0.2 g/100 mL of adsorbent dose gave the most satisfactory results
for all of the sets of fluoride solutions. A maximum of 99.00% F– removal capacity was observed after 30 min of shaking
with the adsorbent dose 0.2 g/100 mL at 5 ppm initial F– concentration. Thus, further studies were done using the adsorbent
dose 0.2 g/100 mL, and the kinetic studies of 3, 5, and 10 ppm F– solutions were performed at contact time from 5 to
300 min. The variation of other parameters, such as pH, conductance,
salinity, resistivity, and TDS (total dissolved solid), before and
after the adsorption process is mentioned in Tables 1 and S1, respectively.

The fluoride adsorption was performed at different pH ranges from
pH 2 to pH 11 for the adsorbent dose, as depicted in Figure 4A. The removal capacity was
detected to be >80% throughout the pH range, and the optimum condition
was found at pH 5. This trend could be elucidated based on the composition
and the surface charge of FAT. As the metal centers are made up of
hard materials, the adsorbent can scavenge the fluoride, overcoming
the competition with OH–/other anions. In the surface
potential study, the ζ-potential (pHZPC) was observed
at 5.72, as shown in Figure 4A (inset). FAT showed positive superficial charge up to pH
5, which favored anion adsorption (F–),42 which can be correlated with the pH study given
in Figure 4A. The details
of variation of F– adsorption onto FAT at higher
pH are discussed in the Supporting Information (Figure S5). Experiments were continued regarding the F– removal in the presence of different interfering co-ions with two
sets of 10 ppm aqueous F– solutions, one containing
Cl–, NO3–, and SO42– and another containing Cl–, NO3–, SO42–, PO43–, and HCO3– sodium salts, as per the allowed limit of WHO at 30 ± 2 °C43 with 0.2 g/100 mL FAT within the time intervals
of 5–300 min (Figure 4B).

Figure 4 (A) Influence of pH of fluoride adsorption of FAT at 10 ppm F– solution, with inset plot showing the ζ-potential
of FAT vs pH, (B) effect of % of fluoride removal in the presence
of other co-ions onto 0.2 g/100 mL FAT (concentrations of NaCl, Na2SO4, NaNO3, Na3PO4, and NaHCO3 were 500, 500, 50, 500, and 250 mg/L) in
10 ppm F– solution.

The percentage of the fluoride removal got lowered in the
presence
of PO43– and HCO3– along with the other anions (Cl–, NO3–, SO42–), as shown
in Figure 4B(b), as
the fluoride adsorption affinity follows the order in the presence
of the other co-ions, such as HCO3– <
PO43– < Cl– ≈
SO42– < NO3–.44,45 This might be for the affinity of these
anions toward the adsorbent dependent on high charge density and pH
effect.46

The fluoride removal process
followed the two-step metal–ligand
exchange mechanism, as shown in eqs 2 and 3, revealed from the FTIR
studies, and to find out the reuse ability, the standard procedure
was adopted.38Eqs 4 and 5 represent the
leaching out of adsorbent fluoride from the adsorbent, which was also
supported by the FTIR analysis, as shown in Figure 2C. 2   3  where
M is the metal ion (Fe3+ or
Al3+ or Ti4+), MOH (s) represents a surface
OH– ion, and MF represents a surface site occupied
by a fluoride ion.

For the regeneration process, the probable
mechanism can be drawn
as 4   5  where MF is the surface-occupied site, MOH2+ represents the acidic active site, and MOH(s) represents
surface OH– ions, which was neutral.

3.3 Analytical Studies
3.3.1 Photodegradation of MB
The photodegradation
process was performed as discussed in Section 2.5, and to find out the degradation efficiency, eq 6 was used. The kinetics
was studied using spectroscopic studies, and a probable mechanism
was also established. 6  where C0 and Ct (M) are the MB concentration
of the initial and the final state, respectively.

The percentage
of degradation of different concentrations of MB is summarized in Tables 5 and 6. The photodegradation of different concentrations of MB were
successfully illustrated by UV and FTIR studies, as shown in Figures 8A,B and 9.

3.3.2 Kinetic and Thermodynamic
Studies of Fluoride
Adsorption
In the kinetic investigation, the contact time
varied from 5 to 300 min for the 3, 5, and 10 ppm F– solutions with an adsorbent dose of 0.2 g/100 mL at 30 °C at
pH 7 (Figure 5A,C).
For this study, both the pseudo-1st- and pseudo-2nd-order model were
examined as shown in Figure 5B,C. In the case of the pseudo-1st-order model, that is, ln(qe – qt) = ln qe – k1t, where qt and qe represent the
quantities of F– adsorbed (mg/g) at the given contact
time and at equilibrium, respectively, and the pseudo-1st-order rate
constant is k1 (min–1), the adsorption results were not fitted as shown in Figure 5B. The kinetic studies were
illustrated and the changes in concentration of fluoride with adsorption
time were monitored at various time intervals, and kinetic results
were verified for the pseudo-2nd-order model (eq 7). 7  where the qt and qe represent the amount of
F– adsorbed (mg/g) at the given contact time and
at equilibrium, respectively, and k2 is
the rate constant of the pseudo-2nd-order reaction (g min/mg). The
adsorption results fitted best to the pseudo-2nd-order model (R2 > 0.99, Figure 5C) as chemisorption controlled the adsorption
kinetics47 revealed from the FTIR study
of the fluoride-adsorbed
adsorbent (Figure 2C). Zhao et al. (2010)48 and Chen et al.
(2017)44 have studied Fe2O3@Al(OH)3 nanoparticles and pyrrole/TiO2, which promoted pseudo-2nd-order reaction kinetics with k2 (g min/mg) 3.142 × 10–2 and 3.9 × 10–2 with R2 0.9997 and 0.998, respectively, when the initial fluoride
concentrations were 20 and 10 ppm, respectively. However, Lv et al.
(2006)45 and Kumar et al. (2017)3 have shown k2 (g min/mg) to be 4.4846 × 10–3 and 1.9 × 10–3 with R2 0.99 and 0.997 when the initial F– concentration
was considered to be 50 and 11 ppm, respectively. In our study, k2 (g min/mg) was found to be of higher value
on the order of 10–1 for 3 and 5 ppm initial F–concentration, whereas k2 was in the order of 10–2 for 10 ppm F– concentration with R2 value 0.999 in
all the cases. The pseudo-2nd-order kinetic results of FAT are compared
in Table 3.

The adsorption capacities
were studied with adsorbent dose 0.2
g/100 mL for the adsorption isotherm study, which was well fitted
in Langmuir isotherm model,47 as shown
in Figure 5D. Using
the Langmuir isotherm further investigations, ΔH0 and ΔS0 were evaluated
by using the Van’t Hoff plot,49 as
shown in Figure 6 and
data summarized in Table 4.

The result
revealed that FAT nano-adsorbent was able to adsorb
the F– ions by electrostatic interaction as well
as by chemisorption. The negative (−ve) value of ΔH0 indicated that the adsorption process was
exothermic, and the (−ve) value of ΔS0 indicated
that the adsorption process was reversible; that is, the adsorbent
FAT could be reused for another batch studies.

3.3.3 Kinetics of the Dye Degradation under Visible
Light
To describe the photodegradation process using 1 mmol
FAT, experimental setups were done as stated in Section 2.5 and the color change with
time of the arrested solutions is shown in Figure 7a–g. The change in concentration of
MB with respect to the irradiation time was measured as shown in Figure 8. The kinetics results were best fitted to the Lindemann–Hinshelwood
pseudo-1st-order kinetics50 for 10–5 and 10–4 (M) MB, respectively,
and the rate constants were evaluated through −ln(C/C0) versus t plot,
as shown in Figure 8C,D (inset) for the sets shown in Figure 8A,B. The percentage degradation of MB with
FAT photocatalysts was calculated using eq 6. The kinetic details and percentage degradation
data are mentioned in Table 5.

of using the trimetallic nanocomposite FAT as a photocatalyst
instead of the commercially available TiO2 (Merck Specialties

3.3.4 UV and FTIR Investigation
of Photodegraded
Products
The UV–visible spectrum of 10–5 (M) and 10–4 (M) MB (a typical thiazine dye) showed
absorption (λmax) intensely at 293.4 and 663 nm,54 as shown in Figure 8A,B, respectively. The change from blue color
to colorless aqueous solution of MB in the presence of FAT irradiated
in sunlight indicated the chemical change in the aqueous solution.
In UV analysis in Figure 8A,B, the peaks of MB gradually lowered as the irradiation
time continued. The 663 nm peak disappeared and a peak generated at
246.8 nm, which represented the formation of leuco-MB (LMB) (C16H19N3S), the reduced product of MB.55

In FTIR studies, shown in Figure 9a characteristic peaks of MB were observed at 1600, 1356,
1144, and 1065 cm–1 for C=C group, C–N(Me)2 group, C–N bending, and C–S–C stretching,
respectively,56 and the band at 3425 cm–1 was for the O–H stretching. As the photodegradation
process continued, the FTIR patterns changed, where signature peaks
of MB57 disappeared. The presence of the
peak around 1640 cm–1 in the products ensured the
presence of the C=C group and 1071 cm–1 also
indicated the C–S–C stretching present in the product
(Figure 9b-c). The
bands around 3400 cm–1 got broadened and peaks around
580 cm–1 appeared in the degraded products, which
indicated the presence of the N–H 2° amine group and N–H
wagging. Thus, the FTIR study also revealed that MB got photodegraded
in the presence of FAT and the aromatic rings did not break down,
and the appearance of the 2° N–H amine group supported
the formation of LMB after the degradation.

Figure 9 FTIR studies of photodegradation
of MB using 1 mmol FAT.

3.3.5 Photocatalytic Mechanism of MB
The UV and FTIR studies supported that MB was reduced to LMB in the
photodegradation process. From the UV–vis DRS study, the band
gap of FAT was found to be 1.72 eV (see Supporting Information, Figure S6a,b). On photoirradiation, FAT generate
electrons (eCB–) in the conduction band
(CB) and holes (hVB+) in the valance band (VB).
The water molecules (H2O) in the reaction medium reacted
with the holes (hVB+) in the VB to produce H+. Now the generated electrons in the CB and the H+ produced in the medium preformed the reduction of MB to LMB through
the 2e–, 1H+ mechanism,58 as shown in Figure 10 representing the mechanism of degradation of MB using
FAT.

Figure 10 Mechanistic path of photodegradation of MB using 1 mmol FAT.

The proposed mechanism of the
MB degradation was associated with
the electrons formed in the CB of FAT. To understand the key role
of the CB electrons, the same degradation procedure was adopted using
an electron scavenger (0.05 mM AgNO3),33 where the degradation (%) got lowered up to 30 and 35%
for 10–5 and 10–4 (M) MB solutions,
respectively, as shown in Figure 11a,b. Thus, it could be concluded that the electrons
generated in the CB were solely responsible to carry out the photodegradation.

of (a) 10–5 (M) and (b) 10–4 (M)
MB using electron scavenger (AgNO3) over FAT under solar
irradiation.

3.4 Recycling
Study
Reusability of an
adsorbent is the promising aspect of an adsorbent. In this communication,
reuse sets were performed for the 10 ppm F– solution,
with the 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 g/100 mL adsorbent doses for 45 min contact
time, discussed in Section 3.2.1, and to reuse FAT for the F– removal
process, the standard process was adopted.38 To reuse, after the photodegradation process, FAT was washed with
0.1 (M) HCl and ethanol and deionized water until the adsorbents got
neutral and filtered, and allowed to dry in oven at 110 °C. The
regeneration efficiencies of both the water treatments were still
at their higher value up to five cycles, as shown in Figure 12a,b.

at different adsorbent doses in fluoride
adsorption; (b) reusability of FAT in the photodegradation process
in different MB solutions.

4 Conclusions
In conclusion, the present
study describes the preparation of trimetallic
nanocomposite, FAT, by a tuned, fast, energy-efficient chemical route
as a useful material for contaminated or waste water treatment. The
average particle size and grain size of FAT powder were estimated
through TEM and SEM studies, which were 42 and 155 nm, respectively.
XRD study of the synthesized nano-adsorbent FAT was orthorhombic with
326 Å3 unit cell volume. The results confirmed that
the high fluoride removal capacity was found for the adsorbent dose
0.2 g/100 mL for all sets. The fluoride adsorption occurred through
the chemisorption process following the pseudo-2nd-order kinetic model
with rate constant values in between 10–1 and 10–2 g min/mg range via a two-step metal ligand exchange
mechanism. FAT (1 mmol) can act as a photocatalyst for the detoxification
of organic dye (MB) to LMB with greater than 90% degradation efficiencies
for different MB concentrated solutions. The photodegradation was
established through the UV and FTIR studies of the reaction solutions
and a 2e–, 1H+ probable mechanistic path
was also established. This photodegradation kinetics of MB obeyed
the Lindemann–Hinshelwood pseudo-1st-order kinetic model, where
the rate constants were in the range 10–2 s–1. FAT could be reusable at least up to five cycles
for both the fluoride removal and the MB degradation process without
hampering any other aspects. Thus, the use of this cost-effective
material could be a solution to prevent the water contamination.
