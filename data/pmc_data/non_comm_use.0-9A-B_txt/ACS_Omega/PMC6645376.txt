A tandem oxidative α-hydroxylation/β-acetalization
reaction of β-ketoamides was developed in the presence of PIDA
and NaOH. This reaction proceeded
at 25 °C in the absence of a metal catalyst to provide 2-hydroxy-3,3-dimethoxy-N-substituted butanamides in good to excellent yields from
readily available starting materials. The application of this chemistry
to the construction of α-hydroxy-β-ketoamides and quinolinones
was also described.

1 Introduction
α-Hydroxy-β-keto ester and amide moieties are the main
structural units of certain natural products and pharmaceutical compounds,
serving as important contributors to various biological activities.1−4 These functional units, also serving as key intermediates, appear
in many multistep reaction sequences, such as the Aspidosperma alkaloids 11-demethoxyvindoline and vindoline, Passerini adducts,
and 3-substituted oxindoles.5−9 To date, a number of methods with a variety of electrophilic oxidants,
including oxaziridines,10−13 oxygen,1,14−17 DDQ,18 dimethyldioxirane,19 nitroso compounds,20m-CPBA,8 and Mn(OAc)3,21 have been developed to prepare
α-hydroxy-β-dicarbonyl moieties,22−25 and the hydroxylation of β-dicarbonyl
enolates is the most direct approach to this structural unit. However,
despite considerable efforts in the area of synthesis methods toward
α-hydroxycarbonyl derivatives, the development of practical,
diverse synthesis procedures to access α-hydroxy-β-ketoamides
starting from β-ketoamides in the presence of novel oxygen sources
is highly desirable.

Organoiodine reagents, possessing reactivity
similar to that of
transition metals,26 are widely used in
various organic reactions as selective oxidants and environmentally
friendly reagents, including aminations, oxidations, halogenations,
C–C bond-forming reactions, rearrangements, and transition-metal-catalyzed
reactions.27−49 They are also used for the acetalization of carbonyl compounds.26,50 In 2005, in a perspective of Moriarty group’s work in hypervalent
iodine chemistry, it was reported that the alcoholysis of iodobenzene
diacetate (PIDA: PhI(OAc)2) in MeOH can generate the active
reagent (dimethoxyiodo)benzene (PhI(OMe)2).26 The concomitantly formed enolate anion 1′ subsequently adds to the PhI(OMe)2 to
yield intermediate A, which results in intermediate B via the addition of a methoxide anion. Then, the oxirane C is formed, accompanying the release of one molecule of PhI
from the intramolecular B nucleophilic displacement via
the alkoxide anion. The reaction is completed with the attack of a
second methoxide ion on oxirane C to yield product 2 (Scheme 1). The procedure has been shown to work well for a large range of
structural types.26,51−55 However, a literature review disclosed that no systematic
work has focused on this type of reaction starting from β-ketoamides
to date.55−57 Herein, we present our recent progress on a hypervalent-organoiodine-promoted
controllable tandem oxidative intramolecular α-hydroxylation/β-acetalization
reaction of β-ketoamides as well as the application of this
chemistry to the construction of α-hydroxy-β-ketoamides
and quinolinone derivatives.

Formation Reaction
of Enolizable Ketone
We recently developed a facile and direct oxidative reaction
for
the synthesis of vicinal tricarbonyl amides (VTAs) in moderate to
good yields (53–88%) starting from various readily available
β-ketoamides (1) in the presence of phenyliodine(III)
bis(trifluoroacetate) (PIFA) (Figure 1).58 While optimizing reaction
conditions, a small amount of byproduct was isolated under alkaline
conditions in MeOH solvent and characterized as 2-hydroxy-3,3-dimethoxy-N-phenylbutanamide (2a) based on its NMR spectral
and analytical data. This delightful preliminary result prompted us
to attempt to develop a controllable tandem oxidative α-hydroxylation/β-acetalization
reaction of β-ketoamides in the preparation of functionalized
amides 2 because this type of product is useful in the
synthesis of 2-indolinones and quinolines.5,56,59

2 Results and Discussion
In light of these findings, commercially available β-ketoamide
(1a) was selected as a model substrate to explore the
optimal conditions for this tandem reaction. Some of the key experiments
are summarized in Table 1. We found that the highest yield of the desired compound 2a was 78% when compound 1a (0.2 mmol) was treated with
phenyliodonium diacetate (PIDA) (1.2 equiv) and NaOH (50% aq, 0.2
mL) in MeOH at 25 °C after 1 h (Table 1, entry 1). However, increasing or decreasing
the amount of PIDA both led to a slightly lower yield of 2a (Table 1, entries
2 and 3). Other trivalent iodine reagents, including PIFA and PhIO,
could also promote the reaction but gave a lower yield than PIDA (Table 1, entries 4 and 5).
Further investigation using pentavalent
iodine reagents, such as IBX and DMP, confirmed that they were entirely
inefficient for the conversion (Table 1, entries 6 and 7); similar reports have disclosed
a different oxidation capacity with trivalent iodine and pentavalent
iodine reagents.28,49 Different percentages of NaOH
were also tested for the reaction, and they all gave yields lower
than that of entry 1 (Table 1, entries 8–10). The experiments also showed that it
is of no use to further increase the yield of 2a by decreasing
or increasing the reaction temperature (Table 1, entries 11 and 12). Other bases, such as
KOH and K2CO3, only afforded the desired product 2a in 69 and 55% yields, respectively (Table 1, entries 13 and 14).

mL) in 1
h at 25 °C temperature.

With the optimized conditions in hand (Table 1, entry 1), we proceeded to investigate the
scope of this tandem oxidative α-hydroxylation/β-acetalization
reaction. The variation of amide moieties (substituents of the R1 and R2) was investigated first. As shown in Table 2, a phenyl group (1a) and various other aryl groups bearing electron-donating
groups (e.g., 1b–j: −OMe and −Me)
and electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., 1k–o: −Cl
and −NO2) at the ortho, meta, or para position of
the phenyl ring converted to the corresponding α-hydroxylated
and β-acetalized amides 2a–o in 57–81%
yields. Furthermore, N,N′-(1,4-phenylene)bis(acetoacetamide) 1p also gave the target compound 2p in 20% yield
via the formation of six new C–O bonds simultaneously in one
pot. N-Benzyl-substituted starting materials 1q and 1r and other N-alkyl-substituted
aliphatic secondary and tertiary amides 1s and 1t also afforded the desired products 2q–t in 54–74% yields. However, the primary amide 1u was poorly tolerated by this tandem reaction, and some of the decomposition
products were detected by LC–MS. This observation prompted
us to explore a wider range of starting material 1. Compounds 1v and 1w were then selected and tested as starting
materials. The results revealed that the reaction failed to afford
the desired products 2v and 2w but resulted
in an unidentified complex mixture. This limitation suggested that
the amide moiety is important to the conversion.

b Isolated yield.

c 95% of 1w was recovered.

d 15% of 1x was recovered.

e 21% of 1y was recovered,
and the yield of 2y was not increased by prolonging the
reaction time.

The investigation
of the R3 group disclosed that it
could affect the reaction significantly. Compound 1x (R3 = Ph) afforded product 2x in only 30% yield,
along with the recovered 1x (15%) and some unidentified
complex mixtures; moreover, the yield of 2x could not
be further improved by increasing the amount of PIDA (3.0 equiv) or
the reaction temperature. This might be caused by the large steric
hindrance of the phenyl group. Hence, Et-substituted starting material 1y was employed in the reaction. As a result, we obtained
a slightly higher yield of 2y (50%) than that of 2x (30%). Furthermore, compared with the reactions using Me-,
Et-, iPr-, and tBu-substituted
starting materials (1a and 1y–a′), it was found that the yields of 2a and 2y–a′ were gradually reduced (from 77 to 50 to 20 to 0%) with increasing
steric hindrance. In an attempt to investigate a wider scope of alcohol-substituted
starting materials, ethylene glycol and 1-pentanol were also tested
with the reaction. They performed poorly in the reaction; only ethylene
glycol led to the desired product 2b′ in 20% yield
in addition to a complex mixture, and compound 2c′ was not detected by thin-layer chromatography (TLC). To our delight,
α-methyl-substituted starting material 1d′ still afforded the desired product 2d′ in 41%
yield.

The previous studies clearly demonstrated that α-hydroxy
amide derivatives are important building blocks for the construction
of 2-indolinones and quinolines.5,56,59 According to these reports, we randomly selected several 2-hydroxy-3,3-dimethoxy-N-arylbutanamides (2) for further derivatization
using the method detailed herein. It was found that compounds 2a, 2f, 2i, and 2l cyclized
smoothly to the quinoline derivatives 3a, 3f, 3i, and 3l in yields of 66, 75, 84, and
74%, respectively (Scheme 2). It is noteworthy that the dimethyl acetal protecting group
at the 3 position was removed simultaneously during the cyclization
process.60 This result prompted us to attempt
to obtain controlled deprotected products 4 from 2. Still in the presence of sulfuric acid, the reaction could
produce the deprotecting products 4j, 4l, 4o, 4s, and 4t in 48–88%
yields when we only reduce the reaction temperature from 80 to 25
°C (Scheme 3).
All of these applications demonstrated the usefulness of compound 2, although they are very elementary.

3 Conclusions
A systemically oxidative
intramolecular α-hydroxylation/β-acetalization
tandem reaction of β-ketoamides was described for the synthesis
of 2-hydroxy-3,3-dimethoxy-N-substituted butanamides
in the presence of PIDA and NaOH. Notably, this metal-free reaction
is advantageous owing to its readily available starting materials,
simple operation, moderate to good yields, and dense and flexible
substitution patterns. Further applications of this chemistry to the
construction of α-hydroxy-β-ketoamides and quinolinone
derivatives have been developed simultaneously so that the method,
at present, can be considered as an alternative procedure for producing
these types of functionalized small molecules.

Section
4.1 General Remarks
All reactions were
carried out under air atmosphere, unless otherwise indicated. Other
all reagents were purchased from commercial sources and used without
further treatment, unless otherwise indicated. Petroleum ether (PE)
used refers to the 60–90 °C boiling point fraction of
petroleum. Ethyl acetate is abbreviated as EA. 1H NMR and 13C{1H} NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE/600
(1H: 600 MHz and 13C{1H}: 150 MHz
at 25 °C) or a Bruker AVANCE/400 (1H: 400 MHz and 13C{1H}: 100 MHz at 25 °C) using tetramethylsilane
as internal standard. Data are represented as follows: chemical shift,
integration, multiplicity (br = broad, s = singlet, d = doublet, dd
= double doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, and m = multiplet), and
coupling constants in hertz (Hz). All high-resolution mass spectra
(HRMS) were measured on a mass spectrometer by using electrospray
ionization (ESI-oa-TOF), and the purity of all samples used for HRMS
(>95%) was confirmed by 1H NMR and 13C{1H} NMR spectroscopic analyses. Melting points were measured
on a melting point apparatus equipped with a thermometer and were
uncorrected. All reactions were monitored by TLC with GF254 silica
gel-coated plates. Flash chromatography was carried out on SiO2 (silica gel 200–300 mesh).

for 1 h in MeOH (1.5 mL) at 25 °C (the whole process was closely
monitored by TLC). After the completion of the reaction, the residue
