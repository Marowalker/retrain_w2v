Cucurbit[7]uril
inclusion complexes with guests bearing dimethylamino
groups show the expected upward pKa shifts,
whereas their diethylamino counterparts display a decrease in pKa due to the preferential stabilization of the
unprotonated form. These results identify the diethylamino group as
the substituent of choice to avoid receptor-assisted protonation of
guest molecules and present new evidence for the role of the hydrophobic
effect as a driving force in cucurbituril complexation.

Introduction
Cucurbit[n]urils (CBn) are water-soluble
macrocyclic receptors holding a rigid barrel-shaped hydrophobic cavity
and highly electronegative portals lined by carbonyl groups.1,2 Owing to these structural and electronic characteristics, CBn display high affinity and selectivity for guest molecules
with complementary size, shape, and charge/polarity. Their remarkable
binding properties enabled the development of potential applications
based on the reversible formation of host–guest complexes within
the fields of sensing, catalysis, self-assembled materials, drug delivery,
etc.3−17 Likewise, fundamental investigations on CBn molecular
recognition also contributed to progress the knowledge on crucial
aspects of supramolecular chemistry and noncovalent interactions in
aqueous media. Some examples include recent reports on the nonclassical
hydrophobic effect associated with the release of high-energy water
molecules from hydrophobic cavities, which was invoked to rationalize
the exceptionally high binding affinities of CBn receptors
toward some neutral organic guests.18−25

Although CBn can display high affinity for
some
neutral guests, these molecules are traditionally known for their
ability to selectively complex organic cations. In fact, for most
basic guests, such as amines, CBn display stronger
affinity for the positively charged protonated species (BH+) with association constants from 1 to more than 4 orders of magnitude
higher in comparison with those determined for the respective neutral
conjugated bases (B). The higher stability of the complexes formed
with the protonated guest leads to upward complexation-induced pKa shifts that are proportional to the relative
stabilization of this species with respect to this conjugated base.
Mathematically, this is elegantly expressed by eq 1, where Ka and K′a are the acid dissociation constants
of the guest in bulk solution and in the encapsulated form, respectively,
whereas KBH+ and KB are the association constants for the formation of the
complex with BH+ and B, respectively. 1  According to eq 1, for
guests with KBH+ values more
than 4 orders of magnitude higher than KB, complexation-induced pKa shifts higher
than 4 units are predicted.26−28 This special
feature has been explored in the framework of supramolecular catalysis,
drug delivery, indicator displacement assays, and dye stabilization,
which in the case of the flavylium family compounds is of major importance
for their applications, for example, as food colorants and dye-sensitized
solar cells.29−35 The trend in the recognition properties of CBn,
showing selectivity factors (KBH+/KB) for positively charged species
covering various orders of magnitude, depending on the guest, is not
completely understood and, consequently, in most cases, the magnitude
of the pKa shifts cannot be predicted.
Herein, by using flavylium cations and water-soluble trans-chalcones (Scheme 1) to form inclusion complexes with cucurbit[7]uril (CB7), we show
that the magnitude of this shift is very sensitive to small structural
variations. Our study puts in evidence that whereas guests with dimethylamino
groups display the traditional upward pKa shifts, their counterparts with diethylamino substituents revealed
downward pKa shifts. These results establish
the diethylamino group as the substituent of choice for applications
where the complexation-assisted protonation should be avoided and
provide new hints into the recognition properties of CBn receptors.

Cations 1a/1b and Water-Soluble trans-Chalcones 2a/2b
Results and Discussion
Flavylium derivatives 1a and 1b (Scheme 1) were previously
investigated and were found to form inclusion complexes of equivalent
stability with CB7 at pH = 2.36 The amino
groups in flavylium compounds are weakly basic with pKa values of −0.35 ± 0.05 and 0.60 ± 0.02
for 1a and 1b, respectively (see Figure S1). Figure 1 shows the spectral variations observed for 1a and 1b upon addition of CB7 in the presence
of a concentration of HCl required to adjust the H+ activity
near the pKa value.

Figure 1 (a) Spectral variations
observed upon gradual addition of CB7 to
a solution of 1a (8.9 μM) in 1.5 M HCl. (b) The
same experiment for 1b (7.0 μM) in 0.25 M HCl.

In the case of 1a, upon addition of CB7, the absorption
band centered at 530 nm (flavylium) decreases and the band centered
at 428 nm increases (protonated flavylium). This result is in line
with the displacement of the acid–base equilibrium toward the
dicationic species and therefore with an expected complexation-induced upward pKa shift. On the other
hand, in the case of 1b, the equilibrium is shifted toward
the monocationic species upon addition of CB7, suggesting that the
complexes formed with this species are more stable than those formed
with the dicationic species. This behavior is compatible with an unexpected downward pKa shift and is in
contrast to that observed for 1a. Fitting the absorbance
data reported in Figure 1 to a 1:1 binding model allows the recovery of the apparent binding
constants for 1a (K = (7.9 ± 0.8)
× 105 M–1) and 1b (K = (2.6 ± 0.3) × 105 M–1). However, these association constants cannot be compared, as the
experiments were performed for different concentrations of H+, which is a known competitor for CB7 complexation.37 Additionally, under these conditions, the apparent binding
constants also depend on the pKa value
of the guest and on the association constants for complexation of
monocationic and dicationic species.38

Owing to the very acidic and, thus, unfavorable conditions required
for the determination of pKa of the inclusion
complexes and the association constants of the dicationic species,
it was decided to investigate other possible guests with higher pKa values (which also would confirm the generality
of the observed behavior). With this purpose in mind, water-soluble trans-chalcones 2a and 2b (Scheme 1) were readily synthesized
through a Claisen–Schmidt condensation.

The N-protonation
of the trans-chalcones, 2a and 2b, can be readily followed by ultraviolet–visible
(UV–vis) absorption spectroscopy affording pKa values of 3.50 ± 0.02 and 4.90 ± 0.03, respectively
(see Figure S2), with the diethylamino
substituted 2b being more basic, as expected. The formation
of inclusion complexes between both trans-chalcones
and CB7 was also investigated by UV–vis absorption spectroscopy
at pH = 9. Upon addition of increasing concentrations of CB7, the
characteristic absorption of 2a (centered at 425 nm)
and 2b (centered at 440 nm) gradually decreases and a
new red-shifted band (ca. 50 nm) concomitantly appears (Figure 2). The spectral variations
were fitted to a 1:1 binding model with K = (3.9
± 0.4) × 104 M–1 and K = (2.3 ± 0.2) × 105 M–1 for 2a and 2b, respectively.

Figure 2 (a) Spectral
modifications observed upon gradual addition of CB7
to a solution of 2a (25 μM) at pH = 9; (b) the
same for 2b (20 μM).

To rationalize the observed selectivity for 2b, complementary 1H NMR (Figure 3) and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC)
(see Figure S3) experiments were carried
out. The complexation-induced
chemical shifts (Δδ) observed upon addition of CB7 to 2a and 2b suggest that the amino groups and the
respective phenyl ring are included within the cavity of the receptor
(complementary 2D NMR experiments were carried out for complete assignment
of the 1H NMR signals, see the Supporting Information). Nevertheless, the phenyl ring of 2a (Δδ = −0.586, −1.092, and −0.336
ppm for protons g, f, and e, respectively) seems to be completely
included in the hydrophobic cavity, whereas in the case of 2b (Δδ = −0.628, −0.638, −0.702, and 0.021
ppm for protons h, g, f, and e), the diethylamino group is deeply
enclosed in the CB7 cavity with the phenyl ring partially exposed
to the solvent, as shown in Scheme 2.36

of 2a (0.5 mM, pD = 9) and 2b (0.5 mM, pD
= 7) in the absence and presence of CB7 (1.2
and 0.5 mM for 2a and 2b, respectively).
pD = pH* + 0.4, where pH* is the direct reading taken from the pH
meter; see ref (39).

Scheme 2 Proposed Structures for the Inclusion
Complexes Formed between 2a and 2b with
CB7
On the other hand, ITC experiments
afforded binding constants compatible
with those obtained by UV–vis and revealed that the association
process is enthalpy driven with a small unfavorable entropic component
(Table 1). The higher
enthalpic change observed for 2b is in line with the
incorporation of the diethylamino group into the CB7 cavity, as observed
from 1H NMR. This group displays an optimal packing coefficient
of 55% for the truncated cavity of CB7, contributing for a more efficient
release of high-energy water molecules from the hydrophobic pocket
of the receptor when compared with the dimethylamino group of 2a.18,36,40

Table 1 Thermodynamic Parameters Obtained
for the Formation of CB7 Inclusion Complexes with Unprotonated 2a and 2b
 	KUV–vis (×105 M–1)	KITC(×105 M–1)	ΔG (kJ mol–1)	ΔH (kJ mol–1)	–TΔS (kJ mol–1)	
2a	0.39 ± 0.04	0.47 ± 0.04	–26.6 ± 0.2	–29.0 ± 0.5	2.4 ± 0.5	
2b	2.3 ± 0.2	2.8 ± 0.4	–31.1 ± 0.4	–34.9 ± 0.5	3.8 ± 0.6	
The acid–base dissociation equilibria of the inclusion complexes
were investigated by titrating solutions of 2a and 2b in the presence of CB7 in excess to ensure near quantitative
formation of the complex (93 and 98% for 2a and 2b, respectively). For the dimethylamino derivative, the pKa increased from 3.50 ± 0.02 in the absence
to 6.22 ± 0.02 in the presence of 430 μM of CB7 (Figure 4a). This observation
is in line with the general understanding of cucurbituril recognition
properties, showing higher affinity for the protonated cationic species.
In fact, from the complexation-induced pKa shift (ΔpKa = 2.7) and using the
previously determined binding constant for the conjugate base (K = 3.9 × 104 M–1), it
is possible to estimate a value of KH =
2 × 107 M–1 for the protonated trans-chalcone 2a. On the other hand, for the
inclusion complex with 2b, a small decrease in pKa is actually observed (ΔpKa = −0.2) from 4.90 ± 0.03 to 4.71 ±
0.03 (Figure 4b, this
experiment was repeated with 350 μM of CB7 and a value of 4.58
± 0.03 was obtained, thus confirming the negative pKa shift; see Figure S18), demonstrating
the lack of selectivity of CB7 for the protonated diethylamino derivative
(KH = 1.4 × 105 M–1). The KH values were
obtained directly by titrating the guests with CB7 at pH = 2, but
the spectral variations are small (see Figure S4). Nevertheless, values of KH > 1 × 107 M–1 and KH = (1.4 ± 0.2) × 105 M–1 were, respectively, determined for 2a and 2b, in good agreement with the values estimated from the observed complexation-induced
pKa shifts.

Figure 4 (a) Spectral modifications
observed upon gradual pH variations
in an aqueous solution of 2a (25 μM) in the presence
of 430 μM of CB7 and (b) the same for 2b (20 μM)
with 250 μM of CB7. The dotted lines in the insets represent
the curve simulated using the pKa value
of the free guests.

The complexation-induced
chemical shifts observed in the 1H NMR (see Figure S7 and S8) for the protonated
forms of 2a and 2b at pD = 2 are similar
for both compounds. Particularly, the signals of the aromatic protons
of the aniline group are shifted upfield in both cases, whereas the
magnitude of the shift is lower for diethylamino protons of 2b. Conversely, this suggests that the binding mode is similar
for 2a in the basic and protonated forms, whereas in
the case of 2b, the diethylamino group is displaced from
the interior of the cavity to the proximity of the portals upon protonation.
The co-conformational
movement is due to a change in the complexation driving force from
hydrophobic to electrostatic (ion–dipole), which is associated
with a relevant energetic penalty. The net result is a lower binding
constant for the protonated form of 2b and hence a downward
pKa shift.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, the present work shows that the general assumption
regarding the selectivity of CB7 receptor for positively charged species
has exceptions and reveals a simple structural motif to avoid or reverse
this selectivity. This can be achieved by substitution of dimethylamino
by diethylamino groups in selected guests, leading to an inversion
of the pH-dependent selectivity and consequently of the complexation-induced
pKa shift. These results support the increasing
evidence for the higher contribution of enthalpic hydrophobic effects
over ion–dipole interactions in the complexation of specific
guests with cucurbiturils.16,18 It is also remarkable
that this effect arises from a small structural variation within similar
guest molecules. In addition to an obvious fundamental interest, we
envisage that such contrasting pKa shifts
observed for a family of structurally similar guest molecules can
find applications in several fields such as molecular machines, pH-driven
self-sorting systems, or in selective supramolecular catalysis, where
reactants might be not selectively recognized but selectively activated
by complexation-assisted protonation.29,41

Materials
All solvents and chemicals employed for synthesis
and for preparation of samples were of reagent grade and were used
as received. Ultrapure Millipore grade water was used. Cucurbit[7]uril
and flavylium
cations were available from previous studies.36

Synthesis of 2a and 2b
2a and 2b were synthesized using a similar procedure
(Scheme 3). 4′-(1-Sulfo-4-butyloxy)acetophenone
sodium salt (0.1 g, 0.34 mmol) and 4-(dimethylamino)benzaldehyde (0.051
g, 0.34 mmol) or 4-(diethylamino)benzaldehyde (0.060 g, 0.34 mmol)
were dissolved in 0.4 mL methanol and the solution was cooled in an
ice bath. After addition of 0.044 mL of 40% NaOH, the solution was
allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred overnight. The reaction
mixture was diluted in 5 mL of distilled water, neutralized with 1
M HCl, and extracted with diethyl ether. The aqueous phase was concentrated
by evaporation, and the crude product was purified by reverse-phase
(C18) column flash chromatography with gradient elution from 100%
H2O to 70% H2O/30% CH3CN. After evaporation
of the solvent and drying in high vacuum, 2a (0.094 g,
69% yield) and 2b (0.110 g, 75% yield) were obtained
as orange solids.

Methods
The pH of the solutions was adjusted with HCl
and NaOH and measured with a Crison basic 20+ pH meter. UV/vis absorption
spectra were recorded using a Varian Cary 100 Bio or a Varian Cary
5000 spectrophotometer. NMR experiments were run on a Bruker AMX 400
instrument, operating at 400 MHz (1H) and 101 MHz (13C). The solutions for NMR were prepared in D2O
and the pD adjusted with DCl or NaOD. Corrections due to isotope effects
were applied using the equation pD = pH* + 0.4, where pH* is the reading
taken from the pH meter.39 The mass spectra
were obtained in a LTQ Orbitrap XLTM mass spectrometer. The capillary
voltage of the ESI was set to 3000 V. The capillary temperature was
275 °C. The sheath gas flow rate (nitrogen) was set to 5 (arbitrary
