The
charge-transfer coupling is an important component in tight-binding
methods. Because of the highly complex chemical structure of biomolecules,
the anisotropic feature of charge-transfer couplings in realistic
proteins cannot be ignored. In this work, we have performed the first
large-scale quantitative assessment of charge-transfer preference
by calculating the charge-transfer couplings in all 20 × 20 possible
amino acid side-chain combinations, which are extracted from available
high-quality structures of thousands of protein complexes. The charge-transfer
database quantitatively shows distinct features of charge-transfer
couplings among millions of amino acid side-chain combinations. The
overall distribution of charge-transfer couplings reveals that only
one average or representative structure cannot be regarded as the
typical charge-transfer preference in realistic proteins. This work
provides us an alternative route to comprehensively understand the
charge-transfer couplings for the overall distribution of realistic
proteins in the foreseen big data scenario.

1 Introduction
Charge
transfer is one of the simplest but fundamental reactions
in life science.1−7 Electron- or hole-transfer reactions are possible between donors
and acceptors separated by a long distance, that is, across protein–protein
complexes.6,8−13 The charge-transfer effect is also suggested to be important to
the protein folding or protein–water interactions.14−16 In biological molecules, the superexchange (tunneling) and hopping
mechanisms are commonly used to interpret charge-transfer processes.5,6,17−19 The tunneling
mechanism is a one-step process which exhibits a strong distance dependence,
whereas the hopping mechanism provides an explanation for electron
or hole transfer across long distances. Although the driving force
of charge-transfer reactions is “encoded” in thousands
of known protein structures, “decoding” them is challenging
because of the complexity of natural proteins.20−23

The building blocks of
proteins are only the twenty l-amino
acids, which are distinguished by their distinct side-chain structures.
Bioinformatics scientists have paid much attention to depict the structural
significance of these protein complexes, and a large number of biological
databases were constructed to classify protein structures in the past
decades.24−31 In addition, the growing amount of high-quality experimental (X-ray,
NMR, and cryo-electron microscopy) protein structures have opened
space to improve our theoretical understanding of biological charge-transfer
reactions. The relative abundance of various modes of amino acid contacts
(van der Waals contacts and hydrogen bonds) could be completely exploited
to understand the nature of electron transfer in proteins. Therefore,
it becomes increasingly important to incorporate the available structural
knowledge into our physical model development.32−36

Generally, in biomolecule charge-transfer reactions,
the charge-transfer
rate is proportional to the square of the donor/acceptor electronic
coupling strength and the nuclear factor associated with the motion
along the reaction coordinate.6,12,13,37,38 Electronic coupling elements as an important component for biological
charge transfer can be derived from various empirical or semiempirical
models20,38−42 and from direct electronic structure calculations.43−48 Nowadays, the computations with more advanced models are becoming
increasingly possible to obtain the charge-transfer couplings for
ensembles of structures. Therefore, it is desirable to go beyond the
empirical parameters and directly calculate charge-transfer coupling
parameters for millions of molecular fragments.

In this work,
we derived the charge-transfer couplings from the
single-electron motion equation of biomolecule systems under the tight-binding
approximation. Then, a promising computational protocol is suggested
to construct the charge-transfer coupling database, which is large
enough to sufficiently represent possible occurrences of amino acid
contacts in realistic proteins. The possible structural changes could
significantly influence the electrical properties in bimolecular fragments,
as revealed by differential analysis of charge-transfer couplings
among millions of amino acid side-chain combinations. Thus, the pairwise
charge-transfer interactions among discretized libraries of amino
acid side-chain conformations, as a powerful look-up table, enable
us to directly obtain the overall charge-transfer preferences for
any structures, in the foreseen big data scenario.

2 Methods and Computational Details
2.1 Tight-Binding
Method for Biomolecules and
Charge-Transfer Couplings
The tight-binding model is an effective
approach to study complicated molecular systems with large sizes.
Here, the single-electron motion equation for biomolecule systems
is derived according to the idea of tight-binding approximation. Here,
we provide a brief introduction of the tight-binding method for biomolecules,
following the previous work of Liu49−51 and others.52,53 The time-independent Schrödinger equation for the many-electron
problem of large biomolecules can be written as 1  where H is the Hamiltonian operator
for the biomolecular system of nuclei and electrons. In atomic units,
the Hamiltonian for n electrons and m nuclei can be expressed as 2  

In eq 2, Ma is
the ratio of the mass of nucleus a to the mass of
an electron and Za is
the atomic number of nucleus a. The Laplacian operators
∇i2 and ∇a2 involve differentiation with
respect to the coordinates of the ith electron and
the ath nucleus. The first term in the equation is
the operator for the kinetic energy of the electrons; the second term
is the operator for the kinetic energy of the nuclei; the third term
represents the Coulomb attraction between electrons and nuclei; and
the fourth and fifth terms represent the repulsion between electrons
and between nuclei, respectively.

Note that the kinetic energy
of the nuclei can be neglected within
the Born–Oppenheimer approximation. The remaining terms in eq 2 are called the electronic
Hamiltonian or Hamiltonian describing the motion of n electrons in the field of m nuclei, 3  

The building blocks of biomolecules
are simply a few repeated structural
units, that is, amino acids for proteins, nucleotides for DNA, and
so on, and the many-electron Hamiltonian in this physical picture
can be written as 4  

In eq 4, L and M refer to the repeated structural units or
sites. The last term refers to the repulsion between the nuclei, which
has no effect on the electronic structure of the biomolecules. Equation 4 can be rewritten
as the sum of one-electron operators: 5  and 6  

The corresponding many-electron Schrödinger equation can
be solved via the one-electron Schrödinger equation, 7  whereas ψ
is the one-electron wave function
for the biomolecules, and the one-electron Hamiltonian can be expressed
as 8  

The first step to solve eq 7 is to calculate the one-electron
Schrödinger equation
of the isolated structural unit at the nonperturbation state. 9  

In eq 9, ϕlis the molecular orbital of one structural
unit L and εl0 is the corresponding orbital energy. Equation 9 can be solved by
available electronic structure methods, such as the Hartree–Fock
or density functional theory method. In addition, the electronic orbital
for the entire biomolecules can be expanded as the linear combination
of site orbitals for repeated structural units. 10  

Substituting the above equation into eq 8, we can obtain the following
equation: 11  

According to the
tight-binding approximation, the electrons in
this model are tightly bound to each structural unit to which they
belong and they should have limited interaction with states and potentials
on surrounding sites. Thus, the potential of the neighboring sites
can be treated as perturbations. The tight-binding Hamiltonian is
usually written as 12  where c and c+ are the
annihilation and creation operators for electrons
or holes, respectively, ε is the on-site energy, and t is the transfer integral between sites.

In the tight-binding
approximation, the electron has limited interaction
with the non-neighboring sites. Thus, we can get the following expression: 13  

After comparing eqs 12 and 13, the formulas
for the on-site energy
and transfer integral can be given as 14   15  

The summation runs over all possible sites L;
however, only the neighboring sites are required to be considered
in the tight-binding approximation. Thus, the on-site energy for site n only needs the potential information of site n and its closest neighboring sites C; the related formula
of on-site energy can be simplified as 16  

It
is obvious that the on-site energy in eq 16 is not fully equal to the orbital energy
of the site n; at least, the first neighboring sites
should be considered. The transfer integral only requires the potentials
of sites n and n + 1, that is 17  

The transfer integral describes the ability to perform charge
transfer
among neighbor sites; meanwhile, the on-site energy describes the
ability to move or inject an electron from a specific site. The use
of amino acid dimers is sufficient for the construction of a charge-transfer
coupling matrix.

Because the tight-binding model is corresponding
to the orthogonal
basis, the Löwdin method is performed to minimize the orbital
overlap. In addition, the effective transfer integral can be transformed
to 18  

In eq 18, s is the orbital overlap integral between sites. This transformation
shows minor effects on the on-site energy and therefore can be ignored
in our code implementation.

As two basic variables, the on-site
energy and transfer integral
are the diagonal and off-diagonal elements of the tight-binding Hamiltonian,
respectively, which are basic physical variables in the study of DNA
damage and respiration, photosynthesis, and the design of molecular
electronic devices and charge-transfer problems.

The matrix
elements of the overlap and Fock matrices are extracted
from Gaussian 09 output, and then they are used to calculate the on-site
energy and charge-transfer coupling. Once the tight-binding Hamiltonian
is constructed, we may directly solve the well-known eigenvalue equation
(HC = EC) for the electronic structure calculations
of biomolecules. Also, the implementation of this workflow can be
found in http://github.com/dulikai/bioX. Further work on the application of the charge-transfer database
can be found in our recent work.54 This
work is not aimed to deal with the charge-transfer interactions in
complex proteins. In addition, we hope to understand the big picture
of the tight-binding Hamiltonian elements from millions of possible
amino acid combinations.

2.2 Construction of the Charge-Transfer
Knowledge
Graph
The Protein Data Bank (PDB) contains a wealth of data
on nonbonded biomolecule interactions. This information is useful
for us to develop a data-driven or informatics-based model. Here,
the data collection procedure is accomplished by extracting the structural
data from an improved version of the “Atlas of Protein Side-Chain
Interactions”, which are derived from thousands of unique structures
of protein complexes.55 This database is
at its mature state. As of June 2017, the Atlas comprised 482 555
possible amino acid side-chain combinations for 20 × 20 sets
of amino acid contacts. Note that the snapshot of this database on
June 2017 can be directly obtained from us upon request. Each type
of amino acid combinations has been carefully classified up to six
clusters based on geometric similarity. In this fashion, each cluster
has a clear-cut representative structure. The procedure to extract
each dimer complex has been described in the work of Singh and Thornton.56

The initial structures in the amino acid
side-chain database contain only the coordinates of heavy atoms, and
the missing hydrogen atoms were added using the tleap module in AmberTools package.57 In addition,
we mainly focus on the big picture of the charge-transfer couplings
for millions of amino acid side-chain combinations. For simplicity,
only one representative protonation state is considered for each amino
acid because the protonation states of amino acids should only be
reasonable in the realistic proteins. Therefore, we would assume that
the amino acids adopt only a single protonation state, which can be
regarded as the data washing procedure in big data. In addition, we
believe that such a rough representation is very necessary for millions
of amino acids combinations. In the language of cheminformatics, the
side chains in the database present reasonable molecular descriptors
for the differential analysis. The general trends can be extracted
from millions of amino acid side-chain combinations in this fashion.
The workflow to derive the charge-transfer couplings is summarized
in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Work Flow
of Calculating the Charge-Transfer Coupling for Any Amino
Acid Side-Chain Combination
The frontier orbitals of amino acids with large side chains
are
mainly located at the amino acid side-chain atoms, whereas the backbone
atoms may be involved in the frontier orbitals for amino acids with
small side chains. Therefore, the backbone of amino acids has been
incorporated for amino acids with small side-chain groups, such as
Gly and Ala. The point of cutting covalent bond is saturated with
hydrogen atoms (i.e., either the Cα or Cβ atom). To eliminate any potential nonspecific interactions, the
positions of hydrogen atoms were first optimized for each dimer at
the semiempirical PM6 level with subsequent optimization with B3LYP/6-31G*
calculations. The coordinates of the heavy atoms were kept fixed during
the optimization procedure. The quantum chemistry calculations are
performed with Gaussian 09 package.58 The
optimized structures are used for our subsequent calculations of charge-transfer
couplings at the B3LYP/6-31G* level and statistical analysis. The
entire work flow requires 482 555 geometric optimizations at
the PM6 level and 482 555 geometric optimizations at the B3LYP/6-31G*
level, with subsequent 1 447 665 single-point calculations
at the B3LYP/6-31G* level. Considering the geometric optimization
generally requires 10–30 cycles; we need at least 10 millions
of B3LYP calculations.

3 Results and Discussion
First, the charge-transfer integrals are calculated for millions
of amino acid side-chain combinations to reveal the richness of biological
charge-transfer reactions in realistic proteins. This database is
helpful to describe how the conformation ensemble influences charge-transfer
couplings within distinct protein structures. Here, without losing
any generality, we will restrict our study to electron- and hole-transfer
coupling between highest occupied molecular orbitals of each amino
acid side-chain combination. To facilitate our following discussions,
the words “hot” and “cold” are used to
describe the residues with larger and smaller charge-transfer coupling
values, respectively.

Traditionally, the charge-transfer coupling
was often assumed to
be a constant or an empirical formula for each type of residue combinations
in modeling realistic biomolecule systems.38,41,49−51,59 Thus, Table 1 presents
the average charge-transfer couplings as constants of the overall
20 × 20 possible amino acid pairs, which reveals that most charge-transfer
couplings are nonzero and below 0.05 eV. The 20 amino acids can be
divided into several groups according to the chemical compositions
of their side chains, that is, nonpolar/hydrophobic groups, nonpolar/aromatic
groups, polar/neutral groups, polar/basic groups, and polar/acidic
groups. In general, the transfer couplings for the polar/polar or
basic/acidic combinations are greater than those of the pairwise hydrophobic
combinations,60 with only minor exceptions.

the 20 × 20 Possible Pairs over Their Representative Structuresa
a The filled colors
are used to distinguish
residue types. White refers to nonpolar, purple refers to aromatic,
green refers polar and neutral, blue refers to polar and basic, and
red refers to polar and acidic amino acids. Significant charge-transfer
couplings are highlighted with blue (0.05–0.1 eV) and red (>0.10
eV) fonts.

The knowledge
graph is applied to visualize charge-transfer couplings
for 20 × 20 possible amino acid combinations. In Figure 1a, the edge weights in our
graph are assigned as the average values of the unsigned charge-transfer
couplings between two types of amino acids (see Table 1). Each vertex represents an amino acid.
The edge width between the nodes is linearly corresponding to the
absolute value of the charge-transfer couplings. This graph representation
provides a self-explanation of the significant charge-transfer interactions
among amino acids, such as Glu/Ser and Lys/Pro. Note that the remarkable
charge-transfer couplings between cysteine residues are mainly caused
by the possible disulfide bonds in realistic proteins.

charge-transfer couplings among residues.

couplings. (b) Number distribution graph connected by the number of
amino acid pairs with charge-transfer couplings larger than 0.05 eV.
(c) Residues with significant charge-transfer couplings are highlighted
with blue (<0.05 eV) and red (≥0.05 eV) backgrounds.

In Figure 1b, we
try to go beyond the analysis of average charge-transfer couplings,
and details of the entire 482 555 amino acid pairs are exploited.
The edge weights are assigned as the number of structures with charge-transfer
couplings larger than 0.05 eV in each kind of amino acid combinations.
This graph retains most topological features of charge-transfer couplings
in Figure 1a, which
indicates that the average structures of each amino acid pair provide
a reasonable approximation to interpret the charge-transfer couplings
in realistic proteins. Figure 1c summarizes the charge-transfer significance of each amino
acid, which is consistent with our common sense that most remarkable
residues for charge-transfer reactions are those polar residues, such
as Ser and Lys. This one-dimensional representation may be useful
as a reference material to qualitatively understand the possible charge-transfer
features in proteins.

Next, we focus on the top 16 amino acid
pairs with significant
charge-transfer couplings in 400 possible amino acid pairs. In Figure 2, the box plots are
used as a quick way of examining the variation in statistical population
of charge-transfer couplings. Each box plot refers to the distinct
geometric clusters for a specific type of the amino acid pair. The
median values of the charge-transfer couplings for each geometric
cluster are significantly different. The spacings between the different
parts of the box indicate the degree of dispersion (spread) and skewness
of the data. The overall charge-transfer couplings are widely distributed
among geometric clusters within a specific amino acid combination.
These observations are consistent with our calculated median and standard
deviation of the charge-transfer coupling database (Tables S1–S3). In summary, each type of amino acid
pair or even each geometric cluster may contain widespread charge-transfer
couplings. Thus, it is not always a good choice to assume that the
charge-transfer coupling is the same for one type of amino acid combinations
in realistic proteins and their dynamics studies.

Figure 2 Box plots are used to
depict the character of charge-transfer couplings.
Each plot shows the distinct clusters for a specific amino acid pair.
The bottom and top of the box are the first and third quartiles, respectively,
and the band inside the box is the second quartile (the median). Note
that the scale of the y-axis is not the same to enhance
the comparison within each box plot.

Figure 3 presents
three-dimensional structure distributions for the Glu/Glu and His/Glu
pairs as typical systems, which have an intermediate total number
of observed contacts (2475 and 2583) in the protein amino acid side-chain
atlas. Figure 3a,b
shows the geometric distributions for each amino acid pair, for which
the amino acids have distinct interaction patterns, indicating that
their packing is not entirely random.61−63 The population of charge-transfer
couplings is encoded in various models of geometric contacts, that
is, the hydrogen bonds or van der Waals contacts. The geometric distributions
with charge-transfer couplings greater than 0.05 eV are shown in Figure 3c,d. A few geometric
clusters completely disappear in the Glu/Glu and His/Glu pairs, which
indicates their minor contribution to the possible charge-transfer
events. These results suggest that the charge-transfer coupling distribution
of overall geometric clusters cannot be simply described by only one
representative structure. In addition, one must pay close attention
when dealing with the geometric ensemble of amino acid pairs in realistic
proteins, and the appropriate transfer coupling parameters should
be applied only after performing tests on similar geometric features.

distribution and its associated geometric clusters for
Glu/Glu (a) and His/Glu (b) pairs. The selective structural distributions
for Glu/Glu (c) and His/Glu (d) pairs with the charge-transfer coupling
greater than 0.05 eV.

As mentioned above, the charge-transfer coupling parameters
are
found to be very sensitive to the structural orientation of the amino
acid pairs,3,64−66 in the context
of overall geometric distribution. The relative abundance of various
modes of amino acid contacts leads to a very different charge-transfer
coupling distribution. Thus, several geometric clusters can be assigned
as hot contacts, whereas the others can be assigned as cold contacts.
The plots of charge-transfer coupling distributions of all amino acid
pairs are available at http://github.com/dulikai/bidiu.

In Figure 4, the
charge-transfer coupling population is summarized for the Ser/Glu
pair, which can be classified into six geometric clusters. The Ser/Glu
pair is used as an illustrated example, with enough geometric contacts
(3277 contacts) and charge-transfer couplings strengths. First, the
selected cluster representatives (red lines) are not always related
to the largest peak position in the charge-transfer coupling distributions.
In addition, the cluster representative structures may even represent
the extreme charge-transfer coupling values in a few cases. Second,
the charge-transfer coupling distribution curves usually exhibit more
than one peak, beyond the peak position near the zero value. Third,
the charge-transfer coupling distribution can be widespread in the
same geometric clusters, although the root-mean-square deviation values
of these structures in each cluster are only within 1.5 Å.56 In summary, further geometric variables should
be applied to measure the charge-transfer coupling distribution in
realistic proteins.

Figure 4 Distributions of charge-transfer couplings (eV) for the
six geometric
clusters of the Ser/Glu pair are shown, where Ser is the center fragment.
The red line refers to the charge-transfer couplings for the representative
structure of each geometric cluster.

The explicit geometric correlation with the charge-transfer
couplings
is investigated. The electronic coupling is usually supposed to decay
exponentially with the distance between donors and acceptors67−69Figure 5 shows the
charge-transfer couplings along the center to center distance between
the two amino acid pairs. Because of the anisotropic feature of amino
acids, it is hard to say that the amino acid pairs with larger charge-transfer
couplings show relatively shorter pairwise distances. In most cases,
the values of charge-transfer couplings can differ by 1 order of magnitude
at the median range (4.0–5.0 A). The charge-transfer couplings
remarkably decay to nearly zero beyond the median range. In addition,
the overall charge-transfer coupling distribution is strongly related
to the physicochemical properties of amino acids. In addition, each
type of amino acid pairs exhibits its specific charge-transfer coupling
feature or fingerprint.

Figure 5 Charge-transfer couplings as a function of amino
acid pairwise
distance for top 16 amino acid pairs.

It is expected that more abundant electronic information
can be
derived from the orientation of amino acid side-chain contacts. Figure 6 provides the charge-transfer
coupling distribution as a function of distance and angle between
pairwise amino acids. The definition of the coordinate system can
be found in Scheme S1. The overall view
of heat maps suggests that each type of amino acid combinations contains
its specific charge-transfer coupling distribution. In addition, the
charge-transfer coupling shows strong anisotropic features among various
clusters of amino acid side-chain combinations. We can find a few
distinct hot regions, for which the unsigned charge-transfer couplings
are larger than those of its surroundings. Thus, the angular variable
should be considered in the analytical estimate of the charge-transfer
couplings among amino acids. The anisotropic stacking of protein side
chains could be a critical factor to determine the electronic properties
of proteins. In addition, we suggest that the possible structural
changes could significantly influence the electronic properties in
proteins.64,66,70,71

Figure 6 Distance vs angular-dependent charge-transfer couplings
for top
16 amino acid pairs.

Finally, we present the selected structures for top 16 amino
acid
pairs with most significant charge-transfer couplings in Figure 7. It is clear that
the amino acid pair should have specific contacts to achieve high
charge-transfer couplings. Various intermolecular interactions can
be responsible for the significant charge-transfer reactions. The
hydrogen bonds are most common in the available amino acid pairs,
such as Asp/Thr, Asp/Ser, Glu/Ser, Glu/Glu, and Glu/Thr. This is consistent
with our common sense.3,23,59,60 The π···π stacking
or C–H···π interactions between the hydrophobic
amino acid side chain and aromatic rings are also observed to be important
for the charge-transfer reactions (i.e., Lys/Phe, Phe/His, and so
on), although their absolute couplings values are not very large (∼0.05
eV). The role of C–H···π interactions
in charge-transfer reactions is not commonly recognized,72,73 although the C–H···π interactions are
reported to play an important role because of their significant occurrences
in organic crystals, proteins, and nucleic acids.74−76 Further investigation
of the role of C–H···π interactions in
charge-transfer interactions is needed. In summary, the exploitation
of the mega data sets allows us to rationalize the charge-transfer
couplings and their structural characters on the same foot.

significant charge-transfer couplings.

4 Conclusions
In summary, we present a promising
protocol to construct a charge-transfer
database at a residue level, which is derived from millions of electronic
structure calculations among 20 × 20 possible amino acid side-chain
combinations. In this fashion, the possible charge-transfer properties
among residues could be understood in a more explicit and more intuitionistic
fashion, without any requirement of the knowledge of chemical intuition
about the chemical interactions or empirical formulas. In addition,
the possible structural changes could significantly influence the
electronic properties in proteins. On the basis of these observations,
we suggest that the protein charge transfer can be accomplished by
the selective arrangement of interacting amino acid orientations.

The construction of charge-transfer database for amino acids presents
one of the key steps toward understanding the electronic structure
information in proteins. Future work may be possible to enumerate
the most common hot motifs that are suitable for charge-transfer reactions
in proteins by reusing sophisticated charge-transfer parameters.
