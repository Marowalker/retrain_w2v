Recently,
two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)
have received tremendous attention in many fields including environmental
remediation. Magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4NPs)
decorated with MoS2 (MoS2@Fe3O4NPs) have been synthesized via a new one-step synthesis route
and utilized as an efficient adsorbent for removal of Cr(VI)/Cr(III)
from aqueous solutions. The obtained MoS2@Fe3O4NPs with numerous surface hydroxyl groups show uniform
size and shape, excellent water-dispersibility, and superior magnetic
property to enhance the adsorption. The physicochemical properties
of the adsorbent prior to and after adsorption of Cr(VI)/Cr(III) were
extensively characterized using several advanced instrumental techniques.The
adsorption of Cr(VI)/Cr(III) on MoS2@Fe3O4NPs was performed under batch conditions aiming at identification
of optimal contact time, pH value of chromium solution, and influence
of the presence of competitive ions. This study was supported by modeling
of adsorption equilibrium and kinetics by using empirical equations.

1 Introduction
The
tremendous increase in the usage of heavy metals in diverse
industrial applications has caused in an increased amount of “chromium
pollution” into the water bodies. The global awareness of their
underlying detrimental effects has received great attention in the
past decade. The chromium oxidation states vary from −2 to
+6, whereas the most stable oxidation states are +3 and +6. Between
the last two, Cr(VI) compounds cause more concerns due to their high
water solubility and mobility.1−3 The permitted levels for Cr(III)
and Cr(VI) in wastewater are 2 and 0.05 mg L–1,
respectively.4,5 To meet the required levels, several
treatment technologies have been developed, among which adsorption-based
processes are primarily preferred due to their removal efficiency
and cost efficiency.4 Current research
focuses on development of selectivity toward sorbent chromium ions,
which when dispersed in water, can be easily captured to be then regenerated
and reused.

Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs)
represent an alternative
group of materials in which application for water cleanup started
to be developed several years ago.6 The
undisputed advantage of the Fe3O4NP over other
sorbents, membranes, or filter materials is their high adsorption
capacity and selectivity for a broad range of hydrocarbons and toxic
anions such as As(III/V) and Cr(III/VI).1−4,7 On the other
hand, Fe3O4NPs is highly susceptible to oxidation,
which can be exposed to the atmosphere which then can affect particle
storage and save transport.8 Furthermore,
they are challenging to use in continuous-flow systems due to their
small particle size and variability. To overcome these difficulties,
several researchers have prepared magnetic Fe3O4NP cross-linked by transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) materials.9,10 The TMDs have a widespread formula MX2, where M can denote
molybdenum (Mo), and X can denote chalcogens, like sulfur (S). Every
Mo is coordinated in a trigonal prismatic geometry to six S atoms.11,12 Such a modification not only stabilizes the nanoparticles and ultimately
inhibits their oxidation but also ensures large surface area and high
porosity of synthesis product.13

In practical applications, MoS2@Fe3O4 NPs can be synthesized to exhibit unique properties14−17 such as chemical stability,9,10 water solubility,9,12 biocompatibility,7 uniform particle size,17 and good dispersion in an aqueous medium.9,10 For example, co-assembly of Ag and Fe3O4 NPs
on MoS2 nanosheets has recently emerged as promising high-performance
anode materials for lithium-ion batteries.16 Song et al. have developed NPs by dispersion of MoS2 in
ethanol/water solution and further dissolution in FeCl3·6H2O and FeCl2·4H2O.
The obtained material exhibits excellent performance for dye removal
(such as congo red, methylene blue, methylene green, rhodamine B,
etc.).9 An additionally, two-step hydrothermal
synthesis of MoS2@Fe3O4NPs was proposed
by Yu et al. First, polyethylene glycol was dissolved into H24Mo7N6O24·4H2O followed
by addition of thioacetamide.15 Then the
obtained polyethylene glycol-coated MoS2 was mixed with
FeCl3 and ascorbic acid. It leads to material possessing
magnetically targeted photothermal therapy guided by magnetic resonance
imaging. Undoubtedly, the combination of MoS2 nanosheets
and magnetic properties (Fe3O4NPs) can generate
a new class of materials with great potential application of environmental
remediation.7,9,10 Therefore,
it would be important to develop a simple synthesis route to reduce
the production cost.

Until now, there are no reports on the
study of application of
magnetic MoS2@Fe3O4NPs for chromium
uptake (Table 1). Its
use for chromium uptake from real water streams requires estimation
of optimal process conditions. As one can expect, chromium adsorption
is controlled by the initial pH of the solution, which defines both
Cr(III) and Cr(VI) hydrolysis products and availability of functional
groups of new adsorbents. In acidic condition, the surface-active
groups of Fe–OH and quaternary ammonium cation functionalized
MoS2@Fe3O4NPs will be protonated
and positively charged, which favors the uptake of negatively charged
Cr(VI) species. Whereas in alkaline pH, deprotonation of adsorbed
surface facilitates interaction with positively charged Cr(III) species.
It is especially important in real wastewater treatment where the
presence of Fe(II) and Mn(II) can reduce Cr(VI) to Cr(III), while
other heavy metals could form tetrahalo complexes (e.g., HgCl42–, NiCl42–, PdCl42–), which, similarly to competitive
anions (e.g., sulfite, nitrite), could also compete with Cr(VI) for
sorption efficiency.18

The aims of the present
work were to provide a one-step synthesis
route of magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4NPs) decorated
with MoS2. We determined capability of obtained material
to adsorb Cr(VI)/Cr(III) from binary and multicomponent solutions
as well as from real wastewaters. Finally, we checked the material’s
ability for regeneration and reuse.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Raman Spectra and Powder
XRD
The
chemical composition of the Fe3O4NPs, MoS2, and MoS2@Fe3O4NPs was confirmed
by Raman spectra, which are measured at 532 nm excitation. A well-resolved
Raman peak was observed at 217, 282, 395, and 596 cm–1, which is attributed to the A1g vibration mode of bare
Fe3O4NPs (Figure 1A).19,23 For the bulk MoS2 sample,
two characteristic Raman peaks are attributed to 390 and 416 cm–1, which correspond to the A1g and 1E2g vibration modes (Figure 1B).11,15,20 Related peak frequency difference is Δk =
26 cm–1. However, as-synthesized MoS2@Fe3O4NP peaks were slightly shifted to 392
and 417 cm–1, which correspond to the A1g and 1E2g vibration modes (Figure 1C). In this case, a peak frequency
difference was Δk = 25 cm–1. This result is in line with the results obtained by Liu et al.20

Figure 1 Raman spectra of Fe3O4NPs (A), bulk
MoS2 (B), and MoS2@Fe3O4NPs (C).

The XRD spectra of Fe3O4NPs, MoS2, and MoS2@Fe3O4NPs are depicted
in Figure 2. Diffraction
peaks at 2θ = 30.3, 35.7, 43.2, 53.3, and 56.9° could be
indexed to (220), (311), (400), (422), and (511) planes of the magnetite
structure (JCPDS no. 019-0629) of the cubic lattice of Fe3O4NPs, respectively (Figure 2A).9,19,21 The bulk MoS2 diffraction peaks of 2θ = 14.4, 32.6,
39.5, 49.8, and 58.4° correspond to the reflections (002), (100),
(103), (105), and (110) indexed by JCPDS no. 037-1492, respectively
(Figure 2B,C). The
visible dominant peak reflects the (002) plane, which strongly confirms
the nature of the MoS2 nanosheets.11,15,24 Moreover, the very sharp peak of high intensity
and strong peak of XRD spectra further confirm a well-stacked crystalline
structure.9,11,20,24 Apparently, MoS2@Fe3O4NPs exhibited peaks at 2θ = 29.2, 30.3, 32.9, 33.7, 35.7, 39.8,
44.4, 50.0, 57.2, and 58.5° (Figure 2D). Two new weak diffraction peaks emerge
from the low-angle region, where 32° corresponds to the (100)
plane of the pristine 2H-MoS2, indicating the formation
of MoS2@Fe3O4NPs.9,20,21

2.2 Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET)
Surface Area
Both Fe3O4NPs and MoS2@Fe3O4NPs have type IV isotherms and
type H3 hysteresis loops, which indicate mesoporous structures of
the as-prepared samples (Figure 3).22,25 Yet decoration of Fe3O4NPs with MoS2 results in increase of the
surface area (74.6 m2 g–1) in comparison
with pure Fe3O4NPs (65 m2 g–1). Furthermore, the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) pore
size distribution curve obtained for the MoS2@Fe3O4NPs reveals a pore size of 14.5 nm and maximum pore
volume of 0.27 cm3 g–1 (Table 2). Thus, the high surface area
of the one-step synthesized material is associated with its mesoporous
features, beneficial for chromium ion adsorption.

2.3 TEM Analysis
of Fe3O4 and MoS2@Fe3O4 NPs
The
high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images of
the as-synthesized Fe3O4NPs show highly crystalline
nature of the material, which was confirmed by clearly visible diffraction
rings on the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (figures
not shown here) indexed to (111), (220), (311), (400), (422), and
(511), which are in line with our previous studies.19,23 Moreover, the measured distance between two adjacent lattice fringes
is 0.47 nm and corresponds to the lattice spacing of (111) planes
of a cubic lattice of Fe3O4NPs.15,19,24 The HR-TEM histograms of as-synthesized
Fe3O4NPs decorated with MoS2 via
chemical reaction have the lattice fringe spacings of 0.25 and 0.31
nm (Figure 4C). The
(311) and (004) planes of cubic lattice of both Fe3O4NPs and MoS2 nanosheets are determined, which indicate
uniform distribution of Fe3O4NPs on the MoS2 surface. Comparable dark cloudy patterns
are visible on HR-TEM images of MoS2@Fe3O4NPs (Figure 4A) and pristine MoS2 (Figure 4B).9,10,16,17 Two diffraction rings visible
on the SAED pattern of MoS2@Fe3O4NPs (Figure 4D) correspond
to the hexagonal MoS2 crystalline structure indexed by
JCPDS no. 37-1492. High-resolution magnification of Fe3O4NPs decorated on the surface of MoS2 nanosheets
allowed us to measure an average size of Fe3O4NPs, which was around 27 nm (particle size distribution bar chart
shown in Figure 4F).

2.4 Scanning Electron Microscopy
(SEM)
Detailed observation of the nanoparticles’ morphology
and
size distribution is obtained by SEM analysis. SEM image of both Fe3O4NPs and MoS2@Fe3O4NPs can reveal morphology features, which are in good agreement with
the TEM results. The clumsy tiny particles correspond to Fe3O4NPs, which are decorated on the surface of MoS2 nanosheets. The average size of the Fe3O4 is
around several micrometers.9,10 The SEM images of bulk
MoS2 nanosheets, Fe3O4NPs, and MoS2@Fe3O4NPs as well as their images after
Cr(VI) adsorption are illustrated in Figure 5. As shown in Figure 5A,B, two-dimensional ultrathin uniform sheet-like
structures of MoS2 nanosheets were successfully functionalized
with Fe3O4NPs, which provides large surface
area. However, bulk MoS2 and Fe3O4 clearly show that the thickness of bulk MoS2 was around
several micrometers with Fe3O4 diameters ranging
from 1 to 5 μm. These particles tended to be aggregated together,
as can be seen from Figure 5D,E, whereas Fe3O4NPs were successfully
distributed on the surface of MoS2 nanosheets. In other
words, the MoS2 nanosheet structure was not destroyed after
being introduced with Fe3O4NPs during the synthesis.
All the above data proved that Fe3O4NPs were
effectively decorated onto the surface of MoS2 nanosheets.15−17 Moreover, the MoS2 nanosheets could probably prevent
the aggregation of Fe3O4NPs to a certain extent,
which can be one of the great benefits for environmental remediation.7,9,10

Fe3O4NPs (C), MoS2@Fe3O4 NPs (D,E), and MoS2@Fe3O4NPs after chromium adsorption (F).

2.5 Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectrometry (EDX)
The results of EDX analysis of the MoS2@Fe3O4NPs (shown in Figure 6A–C) identified the presence of Mo, S, Fe, and
O. After adsorption of Cr(VI), an additional peak in the 0–6
keV region appeared (Figure 6D).3−5,9−12,24,25

spectra of bulk MoS2 (A), pure Fe3O4NPs (B), MoS2@Fe3O4NPs (C),

adsorption (D).

2.6 Magnetic
Properties
The magnetic
properties of Fe3O4NPs and MoS2@Fe3O4NPs were examined using a superconducting quantum
interference device (SQUID) magnetometer at an ambient temperature.
The identified saturation magnetizations of the Fe3O4NPs and MoS2@Fe3O4NPs were
found to be 120.6 and 35.6 emu g–1 (Figure 7). The slope defined as S-like
shape of the magnetic hysteresis loops as well as the fact that both
materials exhibit zero coercivity and remanence at ambient temperature
allowed ranking them as superparamagnetic.9,19,23 Nevertheless, the lower range of magnetization
(emu g–1) for the MoS2@Fe3O4NPs indicates the decrease of Fe3O4 content in MoS2@Fe3O4NPs.9,21,22 When comparing Figure 7C,D, it is evident that homogeneous
black MoS2@Fe3O4NP suspension can
be easily separated from solution under magnet influence.

2.7 Fourier
Transform Infrared (FT-IR) Spectra
FT-IR spectra of MoS2, Fe3O4NPs,
and MoS2@Fe3O4NPs (before and after
adsorption of Cr(VI)) are depicted on Figure 8. The peak at 582–626 cm–1 could reflect the vibration of Fe–O groups, and the peak
at 3417 cm–1 is attributed to the stretching frequencies
of Fe–OH groups (Figure 8A).9,19,25 The spectra of MoS2 reveal a peak at 528 cm–1 assigned to the stretching vibrations of the Mo–S bond.26 Furthermore, the peak at 595 cm–1 and the tiny peak at 587 cm–1 in the spectra of
MoS2 reflect the terminal vibration ν(S–S)
and bridging S22– ligands, respectively
(Figure 8B,C). The
peak at 1089 cm–1 indicates the terminal stretch
vibration of (MoVI–Ot) groups.27 Nevertheless, the observed peaks below 700 cm–1 reflect the ν(Mo–O)’s deformation
mode, which can result from the sulfidation vibrations observed between
750 and 1000 cm–1, giving the most conclusive information
on Mo–O coordination. It could confirm successful decoration
of Fe3O4NPs on the MoS2 surface (Figure 8D). The chromium
adsorption is confirmed by two new peaks around 839 and 819 cm–1 characteristic for Cr=O and Cr–O (Figure 8E,F).1−5,18

and MoS2@Fe3O4NPs after chromium
adsorption (E,F).

2.8 Thermogravimetric
(TGA) Analysis
The TGA curve showed about 3.1% weight loss
of naked Fe3O4NPs over 600 °C (Figure 9, curve A), which
is related to the loss
of residual water molecules.9,23 The visible weight
loss below 100 °C identified vanishing of physically adsorbed
residual solvent and water molecules. The sharp decrease at 500 °C
could be explained by elimination of more stable functional groups.
The total weight loss of MoS2 was 8.0 wt % at 620 °C.
It is close to the theoretical value of SO2 (10 wt %),
meaning that during the heating process MoS2 could transform
to molybdenum oxide and SO2 (Figure 9B).25,26 The TGA curvature of
MoS2 and Fe3O4NPs shows a decrease
of weight by 5.1% at 620 °C. Relatively low weight loss of the
MoS2@Fe3O4NPs up to around 500 °C
indicates its better thermal stability compared to that of MoS2.26

2.9 X-ray
Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS)
Consequent XPS analysis
gives further details about the chemical
state of the MoS2@Fe3O4NPs (Figure 10A–E). The
values of characteristics depicted in Table 3 identified the presence of the following
ions: Mo4+, Mo6+, SO42–, S2–, Fe2+, and Fe3+. It
is in accordance with results of similar material analysis performed
by other researchers and suggests the existence of Fe–S and
Fe–O bonds, with the lattice oxygen of Fe3O4NPs and the hydroxyl group originating from the surface modification,
respectively.11,15−17,24−28

The results of XPS analysis of the MoS2@Fe3O4NPs after chromium adsorption are depicted in Figure 10F. The high resolution
of the Cr 2p region identified Cr 2p1/2 and Cr 2p3/2 line peaks located at 583.8 and 573.6 eV, respectively.29−32 The broad peak of Cr 2p3/2 could be fitted into two peaks
at binding energies of 574.5 and 573.4 eV, which are characteristic
for Cr(VI) and Cr(III), respectively. It identifies coexistence of
both Cr(VI) and Cr(III) on the MoS2@Fe3O4NPs surface. According to Fang’s observation, Fe3O4NPs in MoS2@Fe3O4NPs favor the Cr(VI) reduction to Cr(III).33 The splitting of the Cr 2p3/2 line peak into two peaks
indicated precipitation of Cr2O3 or Cr(OH)3 during the adsorption.34

2.10 Batch Adsorption Study
The adsorption
experiments were conducted under batch studies at an ambient temperature
using the optimum conditions of pertinent factors such as chromium
concentration (from 40 to 400 mg L–1), solution
pH (2–10), and solid–liquid contact time (form 2 to
10 min). The subsequent adsorption experiments were carried out only
with optimized parameters: pH = 5.5, a contact time of 10 min for
equilibrium study; Cinit = 40 and 50 mg
L–1 for kinetics study of Cr(VI) and Cr(III), respectively.
The experiments were performed in individual batches containing a
mixture of 0.02 g of MoS2@Fe3O4NPs
and 0.01 L of Cr(VI)/Cr(III) solution at constant pH values.1−5 At the designed time, the adsorbent was separated from the solution
using by simple magnetic process.9,10 The supernatant
was analyzed by an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS)
with a PerkinElmer, Sciex-Elan-6100 DRC PLUS. The quantity of adsorbed
chromium per unit mass of the adsorbent (mg g–1)
was calculated as follows: 1  where Cinit and Cfinal are the initial
and final chromium concentration
in liquid phase (mg L–1), respectively, and Cfinal relates either to Ce (equilibrium experiment) or to Ct (kinetics experiment); V and W represent the volume of the solution (L) and the weight of the adsorbent
(g), respectively. The chromium adsorption efficiency was calculated
as 2  

2.11 Point of Zero Charge (pHPZC),
Effect of pH, and Adsorption Mechanism
The MoS2@Fe3O4NPs was synthesized through a one-step
chemical reaction of Fe3+ and Fe2+ with cetyltrimethylammonium
bromide (CTAB)-coated MoS2 in the presence of NH4OH.9,10 Addition of 0.1% (w/v) CTAB to MoS2 solution caused electrostatic repulsion between the MoS2 surfaces and prevented them from aggregating in aqueous solution.
This is due to the fact that positively charged CTAB exhibits a strong
electrostatic attraction toward negatively charged MoS2 nanosheets.

The point of zero charge (pHpzc) of
MoS2@Fe3O4NPs was determined from
the plot of ΔpH [pHinitial – pHfinal] versus pHinitial (Figure 11A). The pHpzc was found to be
6.9. Below this value, the material surface is positively charged
and favorable for Cr(VI) oxyanion adsorption. As pH increases, the
surface of MoS2@Fe3O4NPs becomes
less positively charged and the interaction between MoS2@Fe3O4NPs and Cr(VI) decreases and changes
to a repulsive force at pH >6.9, resulting in significant decrease
of Cr(VI) uptake.24,25

of Fe3O4NPs and MoS2@Fe3O4NPs (B,C), and effect of pH adsorption of Cr(VI)/Cr(III)
(D,E).

The isoelectric point (IEP) of
Fe3O4NPs and
MoS2@Fe3O4NPs was found to be 6.68
and 6.15 (see Figure 11B,C). The IEP values obtained are slightly bigger than the value
reported in literature,25,35,36 which could be ascribed to the different suppliers and purity of
CTAB and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2). At pH values lower
than the IEP, the hydrated surface of the MoS2@Fe3O4NPs is protonated and therefore acquires positive charge: 3  Opposite, at pH values higher than the IEP,
the surface is deprotonated and acquires a negative charge: 4  Additionally, Cr(VI) oxyanions interacting
with the neutral surface via a ligand exchange mechanism cannot be
excluded either: 5  At pH below the IEP, the Cr(VI) adsorption
onto MoS2@Fe3O4NPs can occur through
electrostatic attraction or surface complexation. The association
between the positively charged surface of MoS2@Fe3O4NPs and HCrO4– can occur
as follows: 6  The acidic environment promotes the
Cr(VI)
reduction to Cr(III):1−5,24,25 7  As depicted in Figure 11D,E, the increasing of initial pH increases
the efficiency of chromium removal. The maximum uptake (99%) was obtained
at pH between 4 and 7 when the surface of the adsorbent is highly
protonated and positively charged. At pH >7, the removal efficiency
drops gradually, and further increase of alkalinity enhances ionization
of the −OH groups on the sorbent surface and production of
negatively charged (Fe–O–),
which attracts Cr3+. Its uptake can occur via ion exchange
mechanism according to Scheme 1. At high alkali environment, the deprotonated surface hydroxyl
groups of the adsorbent act as an electron donor facilitating electrostatic
interactions with chromium oxycations: Cr(OH)2+ and Cr(OH)2+ (Figure 12).1−5,24,25

2.12 Adsorption Equilibrium
The saturation
curves for Cr(VI) and Cr(III) adsorption are shown in Figure 13 as a function of the amount
of chromium adsorbed onto the adsorbent at equilibrium versus the
chromium concentration in aqueous solution. As can be seen, the experimentally
obtained data for both Cr(VI) and Cr(III) follow L type adsorption
isotherms, providing initially a sharp increase of adsorbed chromium
and tending to approach a maximum adsorption capacity equal 218 and
119 mg g–1, respectively. Table 4 gives a comparison between the adsorption
capacity obtained for the materials investigated during this work
and those of other sorbents found in the literature. The Cr(VI) uptake
values determined in this work were significantly higher than almost
all of those reported in the literature.

The effective electrostatic
interactions between the chromium oxyions
and the MoS2@Fe3O4NPs are evident
from the ascending portion of the curve and relatively flat terrains
at higher Ce values, which indicate the
saturation of the fixed number of adsorption sites.4,5 The
most commonly used equilibrium models, the Langmuir and the Freundlich,
were used to explain the observed phenomena. The Langmuir model assumes
a homogeneous adsorption on limited amounts of sites of equal energies
and the same percentage to desorption of each adsorbates, thus relating
to a physical adsorption: 8  where qe (mg g–1) and Ce (mg L–1) are the equilibrium chromium
concentrations in solid and liquid
phase, respectively, qmaxL (mg g–1) is the maximum adsorption capacity, and KL represents the energy of adsorption.

Contrary to the
Langmuir model, the Freundlich one does not reach
a limited sorption capacity and can deal with both homo- and heterogonous
adsorption, which can be physical or chemical:37,38 9  where KF represents
a unit capacity coefficient and nF is
a parameter related to the degree of system heterogeneity.

Modeling
calculations were conducted using the Maple program by
means of a nonlinear regression method based on the Levenberg–Marquardt
algorithm. The model’s parameters were determined by minimizing
the sum of the squares of the error (SSE) function across the concentration
range studied: 10  The parameters
obtained along with the Fisher
Test (FT), mean error (ME), and the approximation of standard deviation
(σ) are listed in Table 4. The comparison of the data obtained indicated that the isotherm
data are not represented appropriately by the Freundlich model in
the concentration range studied. Opposite, the Langmuir model correlated
quite well with the experimental data. The estimated qmax value for Cr(III) (119.38 mg g–1) is very close to the experimentally obtained maximum adsorption
capacity. As can be seen in Figure 13, the Langmuir curve obtained for Cr(VI) overlapping
the experimental points in linear range (origin of the plot qe versus Ce) is
less convex than the one obtained for Cr(III) and tends to increase
in the equilibrium plateau range (qmax). As a consequence, the Langmuir model overestimates the qmax value for Cr(VI).

2.13 Adsorption
Kinetics
Figure 14 shows a plot of the experimental
data points for the adsorption of chromium by the MoS2@Fe3O4NPs as a function of time. These data correspond
to chromium adsorption efficiency (AE, eq 2) higher than 85% and exhibits almost horizontal
distribution of experimental points, when qt gets close to its equilibrium value. Most of both Cr(VI) and Cr(III)
were removed within the first 1–2 min. Then the efficiency
of chromium removal shows only a gradual increasing trend. Both Cr(VI)-NP
and Cr(III)-NP systems needed 10 min to attain the equilibrium, which
is quite faster than that in the earlier reported research.2−5 It suggests that the active sites on the adsorbent surface are equally
available for both chromium species adsorption. The kinetics data
were modeled by the solid phase adsorption pseudo-first-order model
and the pseudo-second-order kinetics model. The first-order rate expression
of Lagergren39 can be expressed mathematically
as 11  where qt is the
amount of adsorbed chromium, qe its value
at equilibrium, k1 is the pseudo-first-order
constant, and t is the time. A pseudo-second-order
reaction model40 utilized in the study
of adsorption can be expressed mathematically as 12  in which k2 is
the pseudo-second-order constant. Similarly to modeling of adsorption
equilibrium, the Maple program based on the Levenberg–Marquardt
algorithm was used to regress the values of k1 and k2. For both sets of experimental
points, better results for the pseudo-second-order reaction model
were confirmed by the higher values of the FT and lower value of both
the ME and the approximation σ (Table 5). It is quite common that this model gives
better approximation if the experimental data (qt) are located very close to the equilibrium (qe) and do not cover fast initial rise range.41 Nevertheless, the discrepancy between modeling
curves (Figure 14)
and the first experimental point (which is underestimated) identifies
that neither of the rate equations described the kinetics of both
Cr(VI) and Cr(III) on the MoS2@Fe3O4NPs well. However, it does not exclude that a fast initial uptake
limited by diffusion in the external layer is followed by a slower
second step limited by adsorption reaction.1−5,24,25

2.14 Thermodynamics of Adsorption
The
thermodynamic parameters, standard free energy (ΔG0), standard enthalpy (ΔH0), and standard entropy (ΔS0) depicted
in Table 6 were calculated
by using the following equations.5 13   14  where is R is the gas constant
(J K–1 mol–1), T is the temperature (in Kelvin), and K is obtained
from the ratio of the concentration of Cr(VI) in the solid and liquid
phases, respectively. ΔH0 and ΔS0 were obtained from the slope and intercept
of the van’t Hoff plot of ln K against 1/T (Figure 14C). The obtained positive slope as well as the fact that the equilibrium
constants decrease with increase of temperature indicates an exothermic
reaction.4,5 The adsorption of Cr(VI) gradually decreases
at higher temperature, indicating that low temperature is more favorable
to the adsorption process, and the following electrostatic interactions
HCrO4–···+OH2–Fe, Fe–OH2+···Cr2O72–, and Fe–OH2+···CrO42– result in compactness which randomly decreases at the solid–solution
interface.

Table 6 Thermodynamic Parameters
temperature (K)	Ea (kJ mol–1)	ΔG0 (kJ mol–1)	ΔS0 (J mol–1 K –1)	ΔH0 (kJ mol–1)	
298	–63.49	–8.61	–175.67	–61.01	
308	–66.66	–6.52	
318	–63.74	–5.46	
328	–63.82	–3.14	
Furthermore, the enthalpy
change (ΔH0) and the value of Ea were found
to be negative, confirming the exothermic nature of adsorption. The
magnitude of ΔH0 gives information
about the adsorption mechanism.1−5 For physical adsorption, ΔH0 is
generally less than −20 kJ mol–1, which was
the case for Cr(VI) adsorption (ΔH0 = −61.01 kJ mol–1). The negative value
of entropy (ΔS0 = −175.67
J mol–1 K–1) also indicates favorable
adsorption of HCrO4– and CrO42– ions onto the adsorbent surface (Table 6). At acidic pH, functional
groups (Fe–OH) of the adsorbent are protonated, resulting in
positively charged surface which attracts the negatively charged Cr(VI)
oxyions. This attraction is more efficient at lower temperature because
the obtained ΔG0 values increase
along with temperature (Table 6). The negative free energy (ΔG0) values further confirm the effectiveness of the electrostatic
interaction between HCrO4–, CrO42–, and adsorbent surface.1−5

2.15 Effect of Competitive
Ions on the Cr(VI)
Adsorption
The study of competitive adsorption was performed
to investigate the effect of commonly present ions in aqueous solutions
on the Cr(VI) uptake. Briefly, 1 g of MoS2@Fe3O4NPs was contacted for 10 min with 100 mL sample volumes
containing 10 mg L–1 of Cr(VI) and along with a
foreign anion (F–, Cl–, NO3–, SO42–, HCO3–, and HPO42–) with a concentration of 500 mg L–1. The initial
pH of the solutions depended on the competitive anions used and varied
between pH = 4.0 and 7.0. The final concentration of anions was analyzed
by using ICP-MS on a PerkinElmer, Sciex-Elan-6100 DRC PLUS. The data
obtained (Figure 15A) identify that the presence of competitive anions leads to a drop
in the Cr(VI) adsorption. Similarly to Cr(VI) ions, other anions could
form stable ion pairs with protonated Fe–OH2+ groups on the adsorbent surface and compete with the bichromate
for active sites. The sulfate and nitrate anions can also interfere
by reducing hexavalent chromium to the trivalent one.18,42

Figure 15 Efficiency of Cr(VI) adsorption by MoS2@Fe3O4NPs in the presence of competitive anions (A) and cations
(B).

The effect of cations on the Cr(VI)
uptake was studied by addition
of foreign cations V5+, As5+, Se4+, Mn2+, Pb2+, Cd2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, Co2+, and Hg2+ with concentrations
of 100 and 250 mg L–1 to the Cr(VI) solution (50
mg L–1, ICP-MS standard solution). The final concentration
of cations was analyzed by using ICP-MS in a PerkinElmer, Sciex-Elan-6100
DRC PLUS. The data obtained (Figure 15B) identified that Cr(VI) adsorption was not influenced
by Mn2+, Hg2+, Cd2+, Co2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, and Pb2+ at their
lower concentration (100 mg L–1) (data not shown).
However, at higher concentration (250 mg L–1), the
relaxation of the diffusion barrier leads to the competing ability
of cations such as Pd2+, Hg2+, Zn2+, Co2+, Cd2+, and Ni2+ by forming
their respective chloro complexes.18,29 It causes
a decrease in Cr(VI) uptake (Figure 15B). Much stronger negative influence on Cr(VI) uptake
is observed in the presence of V5+, As5+, and
Se4+. It results from the fact that at acidic pH all of
them exist in various negatively charged oxyion forms (i.e., SeO42–, HSeO4–,
H2AsO4–, HAsO42–, VO2(OH)2–, VO3(OH)2–) which compete with Cr(VI) for the same
active sites on the MoS2@Fe3O4NP
surface.18,19,29

2.16 Application of Synthesized MoS2@Fe3O4NPs for Wastewater Treatment
2.16.1 Chromium
Uptake from Electronics Industry
Wastewater
The wastewater was collected from a local electronics
manufacturer in Kaohsuing, Taiwan. The samples were filtered by 0.45
μm pore size membranes to remove the suspended particles. The
removal efficiency experiments were performed using a standard addition
method by spiking the real electronic industrial wastewater (pH 6.5)
with the total Cr standards at three concentration levels (2.0, 5.0,
and 10.0 μg L–1) and analyzing three replicates
for each concentration. A minimum adsorbent dose of 0.1 g removed
about 93.5–97.5% of the total Cr(VI) from 10 mL of wastewater
sample containing 7.4 μg L–1 of Cr(VI) in
the presence of other ions; pH was adjusted to pH 5.5. The adsorbent
was separated from the solution using a simple magnetic process, and
the supernatant was analyzed by ICP-MS. The data depicted in Table 7 identify effective
chromium uptake up to 97.5% from electronic wastewaters by adsorption
onto MoS2@Fe3O4NPs.

2.16.2 Chromium Uptake from
Eyeshadow Samples
Four eyeshadow samples of two different
brands and colors were
acquired from a local market in Kaohsuing, Taiwan. The sample pretreatment
was done according to method D335-85a of the American Society for
Testing Materials (ASTM).43 Briefly, an
adsorbent dose of 0.3 g of MoS2@Fe3O4NPs was contacted for 10 min with 10 mL of appropriate diluted eyeshadow
sample containing Cr(VI) in the presence of multiple ions (cations
and anions); pH was adjusted to pH 5.5. The adsorbent was able to
remove 90.2–98.2% of total Cr(VI) from the diluted eyeshadow
sample (concentration = 140–700 μg L–1). Analytical results along with the removal efficiency are given
in Table 8. Furthermore,
the adsorbent exhausted with chromium ions was entirely generated
by 0.5 M NaOH.

2.17 Adsorbent Regeneration
From the
perspective of practical application of the obtained MoS2@Fe3O4NPs, it is important to investigate its
regeneration possibility toward multiple adsorption/desorption cycles.
Hence, the following reagents (sodium sulfite, sodium nitrite, l-ascorbic acid, sodium hydroxide and ammonium hydroxide at
concentration of 1.0 M) were used to elute Cr(VI) from the adsorbent
by its reduction to Cr(III) as well as to the corresponding chromate
salt.5,18,29 During the
experiment, we followed two strategies in order to avoid the direct
disposal of Cr(VI) into the laboratory sink. The hexavalent chromium
was desorbed from the adsorbent, which was further diluted and reduced
to Cr(III) as less toxic and finally preserved separately. As a second
strategy, the Cr(VI) from the eluate was diluted and utilized for
the subsequent experimental studies.4,5,18,29 The data depicted in Figure 16A show the order
of elution: sodium hydroxide (95.0%) > ammonium hydroxide (79.0%)
> l-ascorbic acid (52.5%) > sodium sulfite (33.0%)
> sodium
nitrite (25.0%).

Figure 16 Regeneration of the adsorbent (A) and adsorbent regeneration
cycles
(B).

Sodium hydroxide was found to
be a potential reagent for desorption.
As a strong alkaline medium, NaOH enhances deprotonation of the surface
functional groups (Fe–O–) which causes Cr(VI)
desorption. After desorption, adsorbent was washed with deionized
water under faintly acidic conditions and subjected to the next adsorption
process. The adsorption/desorption cycle was repeated four times.
The data depicted in Figure 16B indicate that MoS2@Fe3O4NPs could be reused without significant decrease in the efficiency
of Cr(VI) removal for two adsorption–desorption cycles.4,5 Further repetitive alkaline and acid treatment of the adsorbent
results in reduction of Cr(VI) uptake efficiency to 78 and 65% after
the third and fourth cycles, respectively.

3 Conclusions
Novel adsorbent for Cr(VI)/Cr(III) removal was obtained by synthesis
of Fe3O4NPs and its decoration with MoS2. The HR-TEM images, BET surface area, Raman, XRD, XPS, and
FT-IR analyses identified that the MoS2@Fe3O4NP synthesis process is controllable toward the size and morphology,
and a new adsorbent has cubic lattice structure and exhibits good
dispersibility in polar solvents. Its superparamagnetic properties
with zero coercivity and remanence for Fe3O4NPs and MoS2@Fe3O4NPs enable easy
separation from aqueous solution by an external magnetic field.

The efficiency of chromium removal was shown to be strongly affected
by the pH of the solution, which defines the chromium hydrolysis products
and influences the surface charge of the MoS2@Fe3O4NPs. The optimum pH of chromium adsorption was found
to vary in the range of 4.0–7.5 for Cr(VI) and 5.63–10
for Cr(III). The adsorption efficiency is more affected by the presence
of other anions than cations in the solution. The adsorption of Cr(VI)
and Cr(III) correlated well with Langmuir isotherm. The kinetics data
exhibit a fast initial rise that cannot be represented correctly by
either rate law equations.

Regeneration of the adsorbent by
using NaOH does not significantly
reduce the efficiency of chromium uptake up to two repetitive adsorption/desorption
cycles. This indicates substantial potential of the MoS2@Fe3O4NPs application in practice.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Chemicals
The
starting material of
molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) was purchased from Alfa-Aesar,
and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) was purchased from Merck;
FeCl2 and FeCl3 were obtained from Showa Chemicals.
Stock solutions of 1000 mg L–1 Cr(VI) and Cr(III)
as well as ICP-MS standard were purchased from Merck. Working solutions
were prepared by appropriate dilution with Milli-Q water.

4.2 Synthesis of Fe3O4NPs
and Its Decoration with MoS2
MoS2 (0.5
g) was dispersed in 100 mL of dimethylformamide (DMF) and ultrasonicated
for 10 h at room temperature. For purification, the obtained solution
was centrifuged at 6000 rpm two times, and the supernatant was collected
to remove unexfoliated MoS2 and also excess DMF solution.
Again, the solid was redispersed in water and centrifuged at 2000
rpm; the obtained product was used for further functionalization with
CTAB (20 mL 0.1% v/v) at ambient temperature by magnetically stirring
for 2 h. The CTAB-coated MoS2 was mixed with FeCl3·6H2O (2.16 g) and FeCl2·4H2O (0.8 g). The resulting solution was deoxygenated by bubbling with
nitrogen gas for 10 min, followed by being heated to 80 °C for
10 min. The NH4OH (10 mL, 8 M) was slowly added drop by
drop to the heated solution, which was left to stir for 1 h. After
being cooled to an ambient temperature, the formed MoS2@ Fe3O4NPs were magnetically collected,9 washed two times with deionized water (100 mL),
and stored at 4 °C. The concentration of MoS2@ Fe3O4NPs was estimated to be 15.1 mg mL–1. For comparison purposes, the pure Fe3O4NPs
were also synthesized under the same experimental conditions without
having added the MoS2. The adsorbent Fe3O4NPs and MoS2@Fe3O4NPs could
be used for further comprehensive characterization studies using various
physicochemical techniques to confirm the presence of the adsorbents.9,21

4.3 Instruments and Characterizations
The pHpzc of the adsorbent MoS2@Fe3O4NPs was measured at 25 °C by taking 0.1 g of adsorbent
in 50 mL of 0.1 mol L–1 potassium chloride electrolyte
solution. The initial pH was adjusted using 0.1 mol L–1 of HCl or NaOH with constant orbital shaking at 250 rpm followed
by a time period of 24 h, and the final pH was measured. Raman spectra
were recorded on a WITec Confocal Raman microscope Alpha 300R using
a 532 nm He–Ne laser at 5 mW. The TEM analysis was carried
out using a PHILIPS CM-200 TWIN instrument under an operating voltage
of 200 kV. A drop of DMF solution to the sample was dispersed and
deposited on a carbon-coated copper grid. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption
isotherms were measured with a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 instrument,
before measurement of adsorbent samples were outgassed for 10 h under
vacuum at 200 °C. The BET method was used to calculate the surface
areas and pore size distributions, whereas pore volume was derived
from the adsorption branches of the BJH method. Magnetometry was performed
with a superconducting quantum interference device (Quantum Design,
San Diego, CA). The XPS (Kratos Axis Ultra) instrument was used to
record samples, X-ray sources: 500 mm Rowland circle monochromator
Al–Mg/Al achromatic source 450 W max power. The spectra were
recorded using a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (15 mA, 14
kV). All obtained spectra were calibrated to a C 1s peak at 284.6
eV and fitted with a mixed Gaussian–Lorentzian function by
XPSPEAK (a freeware). The pressure in the analyzer chamber was 1 ×
10–8 Torr. High-resolution spectra were collected
using 40 eV pass energy, the spot size of 300 × 700 μm
slots, and 0.05 eV step size. The FT-IR spectrometer (spectrum100)
was used to characterize the functional groups of the material (in
the range of 400–4000 cm–1) by mixing 0.01
g of the material with 0.1 g of KBr (spectroscopy grade). X-ray diffraction
(powder XRD) was carried out on a D8 Discover X-ray diffractometer
with Cu Kα radiation (k = 0.1541 nm, Bruker,
Germany) and utilized to record the characteristic changes in the
diffraction pattern of the adsorbent material. The TGA analysis was
done by using a PerkinElmer (TGA-4000) thermal analyzer, where the
samples were heated between 30 and 700 °C at a rate of 10 °C
min–1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. The pH adjustments
of the aqueous solutions were done using the METTLER TOLEDO pH meter
S20. The concentration of chromium in the aqueous solution was measured
using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (PerkinElmer, Sciex-Elan
DRC Plus software and used Elan-6100 DRC PLUS).
