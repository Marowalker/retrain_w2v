An enantioselective domino Michael–Michael
reaction of nitroolefins
and 2-nitro-3-arylacrylates has been established, which provided a
series of spirocyclopentane oxindoles with four consecutive stereocenters
including quaternary α-nitro esters with good yields (up to
73%) and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 97% ee). The reaction
was realized and optimized with the aid of a chiral squaramide-amine
catalyst. The structures of 11 products were confirmed by single-crystal
X-ray diffraction analysis.

Introduction
The naturally occurring
spirooxindoles possessing diverse biological
activities have been attracting great interest among chemists for
decades, and considerable efforts have been devoted to the synthesis
of the spirooxindole motif (Figure 1).1 Extensive approaches
have been produced toward
the synthesis of spirooxindole scaffolds from isatins.2 More recently, asymmetric catalysis strategies3 and organocatalytic cascade approaches4 were applied in these syntheses. In addition,
inspired by the natural-product-derived spirooxindoles, new therapeutic
agents have been discovered from a variety of derivatives5 and have led to some clinical trials or preclinical
studies, e.g., CFI-400945,6 MI-77301(SAR-405838),
and MK-0677. Moreover, among the spirooxindole syntheses, the preparation
of chiral spirooxindole scaffolds with a five-membered ring is of
great interest to synthetic chemists. Nevertheless, facile construction
of such systems bearing multiconsecutive stereocenters and multiquaternary
stereocenters have been less reported and the approaches have been
usually limited to those reactions wherein methyleneindolinones serve
as dipolarophiles and Michael acceptors.7 In this context, the development of efficient methods for the asymmetric
synthesis of spirooxindole with multiconsecutive stereocenters and
functionalities continues to be a great need in the search for new
lead compounds in drug discovery.

Figure 1 Examples of naturally occurring and synthetic
bioactive spirooxindoles.

Because of their ability to efficiently construct multi-stereocenters
and multibonds in a single operation, organocatalytic domino or cascade
reactions have constituted an important tool in contemporary synthetic
chemistry.8 Since the turn of this century,
various organocatalysts and substrates with exquisitely designed functionalities
have been introduced and employed in a variety of reactions. Among
them, the Michael reaction has been demonstrated to be one of the
most practical and successful reactions.9

The organocatalyzed cascade conjugate additions (Michael reaction)
of nitroalkane (without the α-carbonyl activating group) to
nitroalkene have been realized recently10 compared with the well-studied reactions of aldehydes to nitroalkenes
and the reactions of nitroalkanes to enals. Additionally, bifunctional
squaramide organocatalysts11 have been
recently developed after the proliferation of amine-based and thiourea-based
organocatalysts and have proven to be efficacious promoters for asymmetric
catalysis. Despite the advances of these catalysts in contemporary
asymmetric synthesis, the diverse applications of the domino catalytic
reactions in the synthesis of multi-stereocenters and multiring systems
remain a highly compelling line of investigation.

Inspired by
the aforementioned background and the continuing efforts
in elucidating the organocatalytic domino reactions,12 we envisioned that the asymmetric synthesis of the chiral
spirooxindole motif could be achieved by the reaction of a rationally designed 3-(3-nitroallyl)indolin-2-one
(1a) and a nitroolefin bearing an electron-withdrawing
moiety in the α-position (Scheme 1). However, the following obstacles impede these domino
reactions: (1) the conceivable self-alkylation of nitrooxindole 1 through nitro-Michael additions;13 (2) efficient activation of the nitroalkene 2 as a
Michael acceptor, generating the nitroalkane, and the subsequent alkylation
to the nitroalkene moiety on 1; and (3) the need to control
stereoselectivity in the construction of a sterically hindered spirooxindole
with four contiguous stereocenters, including two quaternary centers.
As such, bifunctional catalysts may be able to overcome these impediments.

Scheme 1 Retrosynthetic Analysis
Results and Discussion
At the beginning, the reactions
of nitrooxindole 1a and nitroalkene ester (Z)-2a were
studied with different organocatalysts in CH2Cl2 at room temperature and at a concentration of 0.3 M (Table 1). The reactions catalyzed with
pyrrolidine (I) provided tiny amount of the product after
2 days, with recovery of the starting 1a (Table 1, entry 1). The reaction with
triethylamine as the catalyst gave a 41% yield of the products, which
was useful as a racemic standard in the next-stage high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. The Takemoto catalyst (II)-catalyzed reaction of 1a with 2a afforded the spirooxindoles 3a and 4a in
63% yield with a ratio of 61:39 and 64% ee of the major product 3a (Table 1, entry 3). The reaction with squaramide III gave a
66% yield of the spirooxindoles 3a and 4a and 96% ee of the opposite enantiomers 3a obtained
above (Table 1, entry
4). Promisingly, the reaction catalyzed by squaramide IV provided 70% yield of the anticipated adducts 3a and 4a in a ca. 81:19 ratio and 94% ee of the major product 3a (Table 1, entry 5). The process with catalyst V did not improve
dr or ee, whereas the reaction with catalyst VI afforded
85% ee of 3a and with a lesser yield (Table 1, entries 6 and 7). Later, examination
of the reaction with catalyst IV in different solvent
media, e.g., dichloroethane, toluene, tetrahydrofuran (THF), and CH3CN, identified that CH3CN was the optimal medium
for the process, in terms of yields (70%) and diastereoselectivity
of 3a and 4a (Table 1, entries 8–11). In addition, the
reaction afforded a ratio of 91:9, favoring the major product 3a in 94% ee, albeit lower ee (55% ee) was observed in the
minor product 4a (Table 1, entry 11). On the other hand, the reaction catalyzed
by VII in CH3CN gave similar yields to those from the reaction catalyzed
by IV, but with slightly lower dr and ee (Table 1, entry 12). Raising the reaction
temperature with catalyst IV in CH3CN to 60
°C facilitated the reaction to achieve completion in 13 h, compared
to 24 h at room temperature, yet a lower ee of 3a was
observed (Table 1,
entry 13). Based on these findings, in consideration of yields, diastereoselectivity,
and enantioselectivity, the condition shown in entry 11 was selected
for the subsequent study.

Accordingly, we explored the cascade reactions in regard to nitrooxindole 1 and nitroalkene ester 2 (Table 2). The results were encouraging, and promising
outcomes were observed with respect to the derivatives tested, providing
the products in good yields (64–73%) with persistently good
enantioselectivities (92–97%) of major product 3. The reactions usually required roughly a day for completion. In
addition, the reactions provided adducts 3 and 4 in a ratio of around 80:20 or higher, whereas the dr was
increased to ca. 90:10 in some reactions (Table 2, entries 1 and 3). The structure of seven
products in Table 2 was explicitly confirmed by X-ray crystallography analysis. The
stereo plots of the X-ray crystal analyses of (±)-3b, (±)-4b, and (+)-3j are shown in Figure 2.

Additionally,
the reaction of 2a (E/Z mixture in a ratio of 2.2:1) and 1a under the same
reaction conditions (0.2 equiv of catalyst IV in CH3CN) for 24 h gave 66% yield of products 3a and 4a, with relatively similar dr (78:22)
and enantioselectivities (92 and 61% ee, respectively) to those obtained
from the reaction with (Z)-2a. This
observation implies that the stereoselective domino reactions are
irrelevant to the stereochemistry of the starting nitroolefin esters,
e.g., 2a.

To elucidate the result of this cascade
process, a plausible mechanism
is presented in Scheme 2. The original Michael reaction of 1a to nitroalkene
ester 2a via the squaramide hydrogen-bonding activation
process (transition state TS A) could engender intermediate C, followed by the Michael reaction of squaramide-amine-activated
nitroester to nitroolefin, providing the adduct 3a. On
the other hand, the Michael reaction of 1a to nitroalkene 2a through TS B, which is less favorable than TS A owing to steric effect, could provide intermediate D. Succeeding Michael addition affords the spirooxindole adduct 4a as the minor product. The development of 3a and 4a is conceivably controlled by a dynamic equilibrium
progression wherein elegant arrangement is crucial and only stable
transition states or intermediates are obtainable.14

Scheme 2 Proposed Reaction Mechanism
Quite a few amino esters, e.g., valaciclovir and SNX-5422,
have
been approved as medical drugs or used in clinical trials. Therefore,
preparation of the spirooxindole with α-amino esters would be
of interest. Accordingly, a sequential double Michael-reduction process
was conducted with the reaction of 1a and (Z)-2a, followed by the hydrogenation on Pd/C in MeOH
to give the amino ester 5a and 6a in 48%
yields, without isolation of the first-step products (3a and 4a), Scheme 3a. In addition, the reaction with meta-bromo
nitrostyrene gave a lesser yield of 3k and 4k, Scheme 3b. On the
other hand, the reactions of 1b with a nitrostyrene lacking
the α-ester group, i.e., nitrostyrene and 4-bromo-β-nitrostyrene,
are problematic, Scheme 3c–e. For example, the reaction of 1b and nitrostyrene
with catalyst IV in CH2Cl2 required
a longer time than that required for the reaction with α-ester
nitrostyrene (Z)-2a (46 h vs ca. 24
h) and gave only 45% yield of products 7a and 8a (as the major products in a 81:19 ratio and much lower ee), along
with many other complicated mixtures, Scheme 3c. In addition, the same reaction with 4-bromo-β-nitrostyrene
afforded 49% yield of the products 9b and 8b (as the major products in a 72:28 ratio and low ee too), Scheme 3d. However, in this
reaction with 4-bromo-β-nitrostyrene, a different isomeric product 9b with 7a, arising from the epimerization of
the CHNO2 group, was isolated as the major product. This
reaction has been repeated twice, and the same results were obtained.
Exact reasons causing this disparity are unknown but may be the stronger
acidity of the methine on CHNO2 and the steric congestion
of the bromo-substituted compound. In comparison, the same reaction
with the catalyst III gave similar yields and ratios
of the products 9b and 8b to those from
transformation with catalyst IV, but with opposite enantioselectivity
and better ee of the major product 9b, Scheme 3e. The structures of the X-ray crystallography
analysis of (+)-7a, (±)-8a, (+)-9b, and (±)-8b are elucidated in Figure 2. In short, these
results highlight the merit of introducing the α-substituted
ester group on the nitroolefin to increase the yields and stereoselectivity
in these reactions.

Conclusions
In
summary, we have established a squaramide-amine catalyzed domino
Michael–Michael reaction for the construction of spirooxindoles
with four adjacent stereocenters, including a quaternary α-nitro
ester with high enantioselectivity. The transformation of the product
to the α-amino esters was demonstrated. The process not only
furnished a succinct manner for the construction of cyclopentane-fused
spirooxindoles but also increased the reaction feasibility and stereoselectivity
by introducing appropriate α-substituents on the nitroolefin
and suitable squramide-amine bifunctional catalysts that would provide
otherwise unattainable products and stereoselectivities. The structures
of 11 products were explicitly determined by single-crystal X-ray
diffraction analysis.16 Given the considerable
importance of spirooxindoles in chemistry and medical studies, the
domino reaction protocol could contribute a useful implement to asymmetric
synthesis. Further elaboration of the synthetic method in other specific
examples is now in progress.

Experimental Section
General Information
All chemicals and solvents were
purchased as reagent grade from commercial suppliers. Catalyst II (CAS no: 620960-26-1) was purchased from Strem Chemicals;
catalyst V (CAS no: 1211565-07-9), catalyst III (CAS no: 1256245-84-7), and catalyst VII (1211565-11-5)
were purchased from Daicel Chiral Technologies. In addition, catalysts III and VI were also prepared according to the
literature procedure.15 Catalyst IV (CAS no: 1211565-08-0) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
and Daicel Chiral Technologies. Catalyst VI was prepared
from (+)-quinidine (CAS number 56-54-2, purchased from Alfa Aesar).15a,16 Reactions were usually proceeded under a nitrogen atmosphere in
vials or pear-shaped flasks. Flash column chromatography was carried
out with Merck silica gel 60 (particle size 0.04–0.063 mm).
Melting points were reported uncorrected and were recorded on an automated
melting point apparatus (Stanford Research System MPA-100). 1H NMR spectra were recorded at 500 MHz (Varian-Unity INOVA-500) or
400 MHz (Bruker AscendTM 400 or Bruker DPX-400), respectively, and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 125 or 100 MHz. The enantiomeric
excess (ee) values were determined by HPLC on a Hitachi HPLC system
(Hitachi pump L-2130 and Hitach diode array detector L-2455) with
a chiral column (chiralpak IA or IC, 0.46 cm ID x 25 cm, particle
size 5 μ) using a mobile phase containing THF–hexane
or i-PrOH–hexane. The optical rotation values
were measured with a Jasco P-2000 polarimeter.

General Procedure for the
Synthesis of (Z)-Nitroolefin
To a solution
of benzaldehyde (1 g, 9.42 mmol, 1 equiv) and anhydrous
magnesium sulfate (340 mg, 2.8 mmol, 0.3 equiv) in dry THF (3 mL)
was added aniline (877 mg, 9.42 mmol, 1 equiv) at room temperature
(∼30 °C). The resulting solution was stirred at ambient
temperature for 5 h, followed by dilution with CH2Cl2 (10 mL). The solution was filtered and concentrated in vacuo
to give an oil residue. The crude imine product (1.69 g) was used
for the next-step reaction without further purification. A solution
of ethyl nitroacetate (1 mL, 9.01 mmol) in acetic anhydride (10 mL)
was heated to 50 °C. To this preheated solution was added the
above prepared crude imine product (1.69 g) and rinsed with Ac2O (2 mL), and the resulting solution was stirred at 50 °C
for 14 h until the completion of the reaction. The reaction was quenched
by the addition of water (10 mL), and the reaction mixture was extracted
with CH2Cl2 (100 mL × 3). The organic solution
was washed with brine (50 mL × 3), dried over MgSO4, and concentrated in vacuo to give a crude residue. The crude product
was purified by flash column chromatography with 10% EtOAc–hexane
(Rf = 0.47 in 20% EtOAc–hexane)
to afford 2a (1.83 g, 88% yield, Z/E = 2.3:1 analyzed by 1H NMR). The pure (Z)-2a was obtained upon recrystallization in
hexane–CH2Cl2 (15:3 mL).

General Procedure
for the Synthesis of Products 3a and 4a
To a solution of catalyst IV (9.7 mg, 0.02 mmol, 0.2
equiv) and 1a (25 mg, 0.11
mmol, 1 equiv)12b in CH3CN (0.4
mL) was added (Z)-2a (38 mg, 0.17 mmol,
1.5 equiv). The resulting solution was stirred at 30 °C for 24
h until the completion of the reaction, as monitored by TLC. The resulting
mixture was diluted with EtOAc (10 mL), washed with water (5 mL) and
brine (5 mL), dried over MgSO4, and concentrated in vacuo
to give the crude residue. The diastereomeric ratio, as determined
by 1H NMR analysis of the crude mixture, was found to be
91:9. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography with
20% EtOAc–hexane (Rf = 0.37 for 3a, Rf = 0.50 for 4a in 40% EtOAc–hexane)
to give products 3a and 4a (35 mg, 70% yield).

(1S,2R,3R,4S)-2-(4-Bromophenyl)-1′-methyl-3-nitro-4-(nitromethyl)spiro[cyclopentane-1,3′-indolin]-2′-one
(ent-9b) and (1R,2R,3S,4S)-2-(4-Bromophenyl)-1′-methyl-3-nitro-4-(nitromethyl)spiro[cyclopentane-1,3′-indolin]-2′-one
(ent-8b)
To a solution of catalyst III (16.3 mg, 0.03 mmol, 0.2 equiv) and 1b (30 mg, 0.13
mmol, 1 equiv) in CH2Cl2 (0.44 mL) was added
(E)-1-bromo-4-(2-nitrovinyl)benzene (44.2 mg, 0.19
mmol, 1.5 equiv). The resulting solution was stirred at 30 °C
for 40 h until the completion of the reaction, as monitored by TLC.
The resulting mixture was diluted with EtOAc (10 mL), washed with
water (5 mL) and brine (5 mL), dried over Na2SO4, and concentrated in vacuo to give the crude residue. The diastereomeric
ratio, as determined by 1H NMR analysis of the crude mixture,
was found to be 64:36. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography
with 10% EtOAc–hexane (Rf = 0.38 for 9b, Rf = 0.52 for 8b, after developing twice
in 20% EtOAc–hexane) to give products 9b and 8b (31 mg, 52% yield). Chiral HPLC analysis for 9b: Chiralpak IA (elute: 20% IPA–hexane), flow rate 1.0 mL/min,
detector: 215 nm, t1 = 9.34 min, t2 = 10.53 min, 95:5 er. Chiral HPLC analysis
for 8b: Chiralpak IC (elute: 30% IPA–hexane),
flow rate 1.0 mL/min, detector: 215 nm, t1 = 7.57 min, t2 = 8.80 min, 42.7:57.3
er.
