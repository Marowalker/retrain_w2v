A simple and low-cost polymer-aided
sol–gel method was developed
to prepare γ-Al2O3 protective layers for
LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NCM622)
cathode materials. The selected polyvinyl alcohol polymer additive
not only facilitates the formation of a uniform and thin γ-Al2O3 layer on the irregular and rough cathode particle
surface to protect it from corrosion but also serves as a pore-forming
agent to generate micropores in the film after sintering to allow
fast transport of lithium ions, which guaranteed the excellent and
stable battery performance at high working voltage. Detailed studies
in the full battery mode showed that the leached corrosion species
from the cathode had a more profound harmful effect to the graphite
anode, which seemed to be the dominating factor that caused the battery
performance decay.

Introduction
Lithium-ion batteries
(LIBs) have revolutionized the market of
electronic power devices since their commercialization in 1991.1−3 To pursue higher energy density LIBs, a high capacity cathode material
is in great demand. One way to improve the energy capacity is to use
Ni-rich layered lithium transition metal (TM) oxides (LiNixCoyMnzO2, NCMxyz), which can
deliver up to 195 mA·h g–1 when the Ni content
reaches 0.8.4,5 Another strategy is to increase
the charge cutoff voltage. For example, a capacity of 200 mA·h
g–1 can be achieved for NCM622 under a charge cutoff
voltage of 4.55 V (vs Li/Li+).6,7 However,
both strategies can cause serious safety issues and quick performance
decay. It is commonly believed that the cathode degradation is the
predominant reason, where the highly reactive Ni4+ and
Co4+ induce electrolyte decomposition and cathode oxygen
loss, subsequently resulting in phase transformation from the layered
structure (i.e., “O3” phase) to the rock-salt
structure and TM ion dissolution.8−12 Another decay mechanism is attributed to the irreversible
consumption of lithium ions for the solid electrolyte interface (SEI)
formation on the anode (i.e., graphite), which is mainly caused by
the deposition of dissolved TM ions from the NCM cathode on the surface
of the anode.13,14 This degradation becomes more
serious when cycled at high voltage (4.5 V vs graphite) and high temperature,
especially for the Ni-rich NCM whose phase transition occurs more
easily. Thus, many efforts have been made to improve the surface structure
stability of Ni-rich layered oxide cathodes via surface coating with
various protection materials such as Al2O3,15−17 TiO2,18−20 ZrO2,21−23 AlPO4,24−26 AlF3,27−29 and so forth. The general objective of these approaches
is to prevent direct contact of the electrode from the electrolyte
to reduce the potential parasitic side reactions at the cathode electrode/electrolyte
interface. However, it is noted that all of these reported coatings
have a dense structure, which inevitably impedes the transport of
lithium ions and thus limits the performance improvement, particularly
at a high voltage where the slow transport of lithium ions will cause
serious concentration polarization. To increase the lithium-ion transport
rate, one way is to reduce the layer thickness, but this requires
expensive methods such as atomic layer deposition.30−32 Thus, it is
still a challenge to develop a practical approach to achieve a thin,
uniform, and low-cost coating with good lithium-ion permeability.
Moreover, most of these studies focused on the performance decay of
the cathode, while the influence to the anode has not been fully studied,
particularly at high voltage.

In this work, a polymer-aided
sol–gel process is developed
to prepare a microporous γ-Al2O3 protection
layer on the NCM layered oxide cathodes (e.g., LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2, NCM622). The selected polyvinyl
alcohol (PVA) polymer can facilitate the film forming while leaving
micropores in the film after sintering. This method could give rise
to an ultrathin yet uniform and microporous coating layer on the irregular
particle surface through a simple sol–gel coating process.
The thickness of the coating layer is controlled less than 10 nm,
benefiting from the excellent film-forming capability of the polymer/γ-Al2O3 sol–gel. The ultrathin and microporous
γ-Al2O3 coating does not hinder the lithium
diffusion process, while enhancing the NCM622 electrochemical performances
at high voltage. The decay mechanism of the full battery using a graphite
anode at 4.5 V is also studied. The results showed that the cycling
degradation of the full battery with a pristine NCM622 cathode was
mainly due to the irreversible consumption of lithium ions for SEI
on the graphite anode, which was caused by the TM ions leached from
the cathode. The ultrathin and uniform γ-Al2O3 coating could effectively suppress the dissolution of the
TM ions and protect the graphite anode from their poison, thus guaranteeing
the excellent and stable battery performance.

Results and Discussion
The coating process for the NCM622 cathode material with the transparent
polymer/γ-Al2O3 sol–gel is illustrated
in Figure 1a. NCM622
particles were first soaked in a diluted polymer/γ-Al2O3 sol–gel for about 30 min, dried, and then calcined
at 550 °C to remove the polymer while leaving the γ-Al2O3 coating layer with micropores. In order to demonstrate
the microporous feature of the γ-Al2O3 coating layer, the prepared polymer/γ-Al2O3 sol–gel was coated with enough thickness on a porous
α-Al2O3 substrate. The top-view and cross-sectional
images showed that a smooth and continuous layer on top of the α-Al2O3 porous support was formed after calcination
(Figure 1b,c). The
layer is highly permeable, as illustrated by the gas permeation data
in Figure 1d. The permeance
of different gases has an inversely linear relationship with the square
root of the molecular weight, indicating a Knudsen diffusion transport
mechanism. The small-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the coating
layer displayed a peak at 2θ angle around 2.0° (Figures 1e and S1a), indicating that the film had a uniform
porous structure with a pore size of around 3.6 nm. The Raman spectra
of the coating layer (Figure S11) confirmed
the γ-alumina phase. For comparison, Figure S1b,c shows the film made of pure sol without the PVA additive.
It can be clearly observed that the top γ-Al2O3 layer was rougher and had thermally induced cracks. The layer
also detached from the α-Al2O3 porous
support, suggesting the poor adhesion properties of the pure sol.
These results indicated the excellent film-forming capability and
the good adhesion of the polymer/γ-Al2O3 sol–gel, which is crucial for giving rise to an ultrathin
yet uniform and porous coating layer.

The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of
the polymer/γ-Al2O3-coated NCM622 sample
showed that there was no
visible change to the morphology after calcination (Figure 2a). The energy-dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy (EDX) analysis (Figure 2b) demonstrated an even distribution of aluminum, indicating
a uniform coating of the γ-Al2O3 layer
on the particle surface. Detailed inspection of the surface layer
by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Figure 2c,d) revealed that the layer was around 7.8
nm on the particle surface, which was near to the theoretical value
of 6.02 nm (calculation with the γ-Al2O3 equation of L = m/ρS, where L is the thickness of the coating layer, m is the coating weight [1 wt %, inductively coupled plasma (ICP)
analysis in Table S1), ρ is the density
of γ-Al2O3 (3.8 g cm–3), and S is the superficial area of NCM622 (0.437
m2 g–1)], demonstrating the uniform coating
layer. Further XRD analyses of the NCM622 materials before and after
the coating are shown in Figure 2e,f. All diffraction peaks matched with the standard
patterns of NCM622, but no signal from the Al2O3 coating layer was observed, which was presumably due to the ultrathin
thickness.30 Rietveld refinement of the
XRD patterns revealed that the Li/Ni cation disorder for the coated
and uncoated NCM622 framework were both around 2.4%, proving that
the coating process did not affect the structure of the pristine NCM
material (Table 1).

Figure 3a shows
the initial capacities of the pristine and polymer/γ-Al2O3-coated NCM622 measured at high voltage (i.e.,
4.55 V vs Li/Li+) in half battery using lithium as the
anode. The polymer/γ-Al2O3-coated NCM622
delivered a bit higher capacity compared to the pristine one (203.97
mA·h g–1 vs 196.07 mA·h g–1), which could be ascribed to the γ-Al2O3 coating layer which improves the interface stability and the Coulombic
efficiency (C.E., 89.8 vs 88.8%). The long-term cycling performance
was also compared under 0.5 C (Figure 3b). The polymer/γ-Al2O3-coated NCM622 displayed excellent cycling stability and maintained
a capacity retention of around 90% after 200 cycles under 4.55 V,
which was 24.8% higher than that of the pristine sample. For comparison,
NCM622 coated with pure Al2O3 sol without the
PVA additive was also prepared similarly, and the initial capacity
and long-term cycling performance are shown in Figure S2. Note that the initial C.E. increased to 89.1%,
which also demonstrated a more stable interface of NCM622 after the
Al2O3 coating. However, the cycled capacity
decreased much faster compared to the coating sample with the PVA
additive, and the capacity retention was only around 82% after 200
cycles, which could be due to the nonuniform, thick, and dense coating
layer (Figure S1). While with the aid of
PVA, a thin, uniform, and microporous coating layer was achieved (Figure 2), where the lithium
ions diffused easily through the micropores in the coating layer with
low interface impedance.33 Thus, the PVA-aided
γ-Al2O3-coated sample displayed the best
initial C.E. and cycling stability. Figure 3c further compares the rate capability of
the pristine and polymer/γ-Al2O3-coated
sample. The polymer/γ-Al2O3-coated NCM622
displayed 87.1% capacity retention at 5 C, much higher than 79.5%
of the pristine one. Furthermore, a comparison of the Al2O3-coated NCM622 cathodes under a high working voltage
is shown in Table S2.15−17,30−32,34 The polymer/γ-Al2O3-coated NCM622 in
this work displays enhanced performances on both capacity and capacity
retention in long-term cycling, suggesting the superiority of the
polymer-enhanced sol–gel method.

1 C = 200 mA g–1.

On the basis of these results, full batteries (capacity of about
2.0 mA·h) using a graphite anode were assembled and measured
under high voltage of 4.5 V (Figure 3d–f), where the N/P ratio was controlled around
1.1 (Figure S3). Similar to the half batteries,
the full battery using the polymer/γ-Al2O3-coated NCM622 cathode showed higher initial C.E. than that of the
pristine one (Figure 3d). Figure 3e compares
the cycling stability of the full batteries under 0.5 C (1 C = 200
mA·h g–1). Remarkable highly stable cycling
performance was observed for the polymer/γ-Al2O3-coated NCM622 sample, whose capacity remained at 154.7 mA·h
g–1 (calculated based on the weight of the NCM622
material) after 100 cycles, corresponding to a capacity retention
of 82%, whereas the pristine NCM622 sample only had a capacity of
only 103.9 mA·h g–1 after 100 cycles and a
capacity retention of 59.2%. In addition, the rate capacities of the
polymer/γ-Al2O3-coated NCM622 sample were
6.9, 10.9, 12.4, 20.1, and 26.0% higher than that of the pristine
one under 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, and 5.0 C rates, respectively (Figure 3f). These results
revealed a large improvement in the electrochemical performance of
the polymer/γ-Al2O3-coated NCM622 full
battery, which benefits from the continuous γ-Al2O3 coating on the cathode. It should be noted that in
half battery measurements, the improvements of the rate discharge
capacity of the polymer/γ-Al2O3-coated
NCM622 cathode only showed 5.5, 7.0, 8.0, 7.9, and 7.3% higher than
those of the pristine one under the same C-rates (Figure S4). Moreover, the capacity decay rate with an increase
in the C-rate in the half-cell was also much lower than that in full
battery (Figure 3b,e).
These phenomena suggested that the graphite anode played a crucial
role in the cycling and rate performance of the full battery, and
its stability might be affected by the cathode at a high working voltage
as well.

To understand the mechanism for the large improvement
in the high-voltage
performance of the polymer/γ-Al2O3-coated
NCM622 sample, the area-specific impedance (ASI) of the full battery
was then studied by hybrid pulse power characterization (HPPC).35−37 The battery was first pulse discharged for 10 s at a 3 C rate, relaxed
to the open-circuit voltage (OCV) for 40 s, and then finally charged
for 10 s with a regenerative pulse at 75% current (2.25 C rate) of
the discharge pulse (Figure S5a). The battery
was fully charged and then discharged at a 1 C rate, and the discharge
procedure was repeated from 10 to 90% depth of discharge (DOD), each
followed by a 1 h rest period before applying the next sequence. One
sequence under 20% DOD is shown in Figure S5b, in which Rdisc was calculated via the
equation: Rdisc = (V0–V1)/idisc. The ASI and the corresponding OCV of the pristine
and polymer/γ-Al2O3-coated NCM622 sample
during cycling are shown in Figure 4a,b, respectively. It can be seen that the ASI increased
much slower for the polymer/γ-Al2O3-coated
NCM622 battery during the HPPC cycling. The largest increment of ASI
appeared at 90% DOD of the battery, where the resistance increased
only from 16.1 to 26.9 Ω cm2 for the polymer/γ-Al2O3-coated NCM622 sample after 12 HPPC cycles, while
the corresponding values of the pristine NCM622 sample increased from
17.4 Ω cm2 to as large as 109.1 Ω cm2. In addition, the corresponding OCVs of the polymer/γ-Al2O3-coated NCM622 sample under various DODs were
also more stable. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
was also carried out to study the impedance evolution of the full
battery during cycling (Figure 4c,d). The polymer/γ-Al2O3-coated
NCM622 sample showed an Rct increment
of 24.7 Ω, much lower than 52.2 Ω of the pristine sample
after 100 cycles. The impedance of the polymer/γ-Al2O3-coated NCM622 battery increased much slower than the
pristine NCM622 sample, which proved that the γ-Al2O3 coating helped to suppress the resistance increase
during cycling and led to the reduced ASI and Rct.

The remaining capacities and impedances of the cathodes and anodes
from the full batteries were further analyzed in detail. Two full
batteries were disassembled after 100 cycling tests, and then the
separated cathode and anode were reassembled into two half-cells using
a lithium metal as the counter electrodes. The remaining capacity
of the polymer/γ-Al2O3-coated and pristine
NCM622 cathodes were 167.4 and 150.9 mA·h g–1, corresponding to 88.7 and 88.5% of its initial capacity, respectively
(Figure 5a and Table S3). The polymer/γ-Al2O3-coated NCM622 cathode also showed higher initial C.E.
compared with the pristine one (i.e., 93.1 vs 87.9%). The Rct of the polymer/γ-Al2O3-coated NCM622 cathode increased 8.6 Ω after 100 cycling
tests, which was lower than 11.2 Ω of the pristine one (Figure S6). These results demonstrated a large
decay of the NCM622 cathodes at high voltage, and polymer/γ-Al2O3 coating could improve its stability. However,
the variation of the cathode cannot be considered as the main cause
for the degradation of full battery when compared with the great value
change for the corresponding graphite anode. As shown in Figure 5b, the remaining
capacity of the pristine graphite anode (i.e., the anode of the full
battery using a pristine NCM622 cathode after 100 cycling tests) was
only 147.2 mA·h g–1 (0.1 C charge/discharge),
corresponding to a 43.3% of its initial capacity. This could be attributed
to a thick SEI formed on the electrode, leading to a high resistance
(Figures 5c and S7), where Rct increased
77.4 Ω. The irreversible consumption of lithium ions for the
anode SEI was responsible for the quick capacity decay of the full
battery.14 However, the conditions became
much better when using the polymer/γ-Al2O3-coated NCM622 cathode. The remaining capacity of the corresponding
graphite anode could maintain as high as 265.5 mA·h g–1 (78.1% of its initial capacity) (Figure 5b). The Rct increased
only 42.3 Ω, much lower than that of the pristine graphite (Figures 5d and S7). The above results indicated that the polymer/γ-Al2O3 coating improved the stability of the NCM622
cathode, but more importantly, it could suppress the quick growth
of SEI on the corresponding graphite anode and minimize the resistance.
The reason could be that the polymer/γ-Al2O3 coating reduced the strong side reactions of the NCM622 cathode
with the electrolyte, especially the dissolution of TMs from the cathode.
The dissolved TMs could migrate from the cathode side and deposit
on the surface of the graphite anode, which led to the continuous
growth of the SEI and the consumption of the limited Li ions in the
full battery.14,38Figure S8 compares the dissolution of active metal ions in the electrolyte
with a vivid visualization demonstration. Two cells using a pristine
cathode and polymer/γ-Al2O3-coated NCM62
cathode were first charged to 4.5 V and then disassembled in a glovebox.
The cathodes were stored in the electrolyte (20 mg of active materials
in 2 mL of electrolyte solution) at 60 °C for 2 weeks. The darker
color of the pristine sample indicated that there were more TMs dissolved
in the electrolyte. The ICP analysis further confirmed this result
(Table S4). It was clearly shown that the
dissolving amount of TMs for the polymer/γ-Al2O3-coated samples in the electrolyte was significantly reduced
compared with the pristine sample.

and (b) graphite anodes. Comparison of the ac resistance of the graphite
anodes cycled with the (c) pristine NCM622 cathode and (d) polymer/γ-Al2O3-coated NCM622 cathode at 1st and 100th cycles.

The surface chemistry of the graphite anodes of
the full battery
after 100 cycling tests was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) analyses. Figure 6 shows the evolution of the Ni 2p, Mn 2p, and Co 2p spectra of the
cycled graphite anodes after sputtering time t =
0, 60, and 120 s. There was no signal peak for Co 2p and Mn 2p for
the coated graphite anode (i.e., the anode of the full battery using
the polymer/γ-Al2O3-coated NCM622 cathode
after 100 cycling tests) (Figure 6a,b). The reason could be that the dissolved amount
of TMs was small, such that the deposition of TMs on the coated graphite
anode was too low to be detected by the XPS equipment. For Ni 2p (Figure 6c), the peak at around
858 eV was obtained from the Auger electrons of the fluorine, as LiPF6 decomposed during the charge–discharge process and
produced LiF as SEI on the anode.39 However,
the spectra for the pristine graphite displayed quite different results,
where the TM peaks appeared when the surface SEI containing F was
removed after etching. The Co 2p3/2 peak at around 779.3
eV appeared after sputtering for 120 s (Figure 6d). Meanwhile, the Ni 2p1/2 (871.3
eV) and 2p3/2 (853.9 eV) signal peaks were observed after
etching and became more significant with an increase in the sputtering
time (Figure 6f).40,41 These results agreed with the previous reports that the Ni and Co
elements were concentrated in the inner layer of the SEI.38,42 However, the Mn 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 peaks existed
at the beginning and increased with etching (Figure 6e), indicating that the Mn element could
be redissolved and deposited on the top surface of the anode SEI layers
during the Li+ deintercalation process so that the Mn element
exhibited higher catalytic activity for the SEI growth.43,44 Further XPS analysis of NCM622 cathodes after 100 cycling tests
is presented in Figure S9. In contrast
to the graphite anode spectra, there was not much difference between
the polymer/γ-Al2O3-coated NCM622 and
the pristine one. The spectra for Al and O elements were attached
as well in Figure S10 as a reference. This
observation confirmed that the control factor for the battery degradation
was not the NCM622 cathode but rather the graphite anode where the
deposition of TMs results in the continuous growth of the SEI and
the consumption of the limited Li ions in the full battery. The polymer/γ-Al2O3-coated layer on the NCM622 cathode could prohibit
the dissolution process effectively and remarkably enhanced battery
capacity and stability under high voltage.

Conclusions
In summary, the NCM622 cathode material has been successfully coated
with a thin, uniform, and microporous γ-Al2O3 through a PVA-aided Al2O3 sol–gel
process. The selected polymer can facilitate the film forming while
leaving micropores after sintering. The polymer/γ-Al2O3-coated NCM622 demonstrated significantly improved electrochemical
performance when cycled at high voltage, where the cycling stability
and rate capabilities were 22.8 and 26% higher than that of the pristine
one, respectively. In addition, the impedance analysis demonstrated
that both DC and AC resistance of the full battery using the polymer/γ-Al2O3-coated NCM622 cathode remained more stable and
were much lower than those of the battery using the pristine one.
Battery decay mechanism analysis (i.e., remaining capacity, impedance,
and surface chemistry of the cathode and anode after cycling) demonstrated
that the pristine and polymer/γ-Al2O3-coated
NCM622 cathodes exhibited a similar capacity decay, while the corresponding
graphite anodes showed quite different results. The XPS analysis results
further confirmed that the control factor for the battery degradation
was not the decay of NCM622 cathodes but rather of the graphite anodes.
This was because the dissolved TMs from the NCM622 cathode deposited
on the graphite anode, leading to the continuous growth of the SEI
and consumption of the limited Li ions in the full battery. The polymer/γ-Al2O3 coating of the NCM622 cathode has successfully
suppressed the degradation through mitigating the strong side reactions,
especially the dissolution of TMs.

Experimental Section
Synthesis
of LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2
NiSO4·6H2O, MnSO4·H2O, and CoSO4·7H2O (Beijing
Chemical Factory, China) were first mixed, and an aqueous
solution with a concentration of 2.0 mol L–1 MSO4 (M = Ni, Mn, Co) was achieved. The solution was pumped into
a continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR, 2.0 L) under the N2 atmosphere. At the same time, NaOH solution (10.0 mol L–1) and NH3·H2O solution
(10.0 mol L–1, Beijing Chemical Factory, China)
were fed into the CSTR separately, where the ratio of NH3/MSO4 was controlled strictly at 0.8. The pH value (11.00
± 0.05), temperature (60 °C), and stirring speed (1000 rpm)
were monitored and controlled carefully during the reaction process.
When the coprecipitation reaction was done, the suspension was filtered,
washed, and finally dried at 120 °C for 12 h. The as-obtained
Ni0.6Co0.2Mn0.2(OH)2 powder
was mixed thoroughly with LiOH·H2O (Beijing Chemical
Factory, China) at a molar ratio of 1:1.05. The mixture was sintered
at 500 °C for 5 h and 875 °C for 12 h in the air at a rising
rate of 1 °C min–1. Afterward, the product
was slowly cooled down to 800 °C for another 5 h and then to
500 °C under a rate of 1 °C min–1.

Preparation
of the γ-Al2O3 Sol–Gel
and Surface Coating
Aluminum-tri-sec-butoxide
[67 mL (0.25 mol), ATSB, Fluka] was added drop by drop into 170.5
mL of deionized (DI) water at 90 °C by an additional funnel.
The aqueous solution was stirred for 2.5 h, while 12.5 mL of 1.0 M
HNO3 (Sigma-Aldrich) was added. Then, the solution was
refluxed at 90 °C for another 12 h and cooled down. PVA (3.0
g, Fluka, MW = 72 000 g/mol) was fully dissolved in 95 mL of
DI water and 5 mL of 1 M HNO3. Then, 50 mL of PVA solution
was mixed with 50 mL of the previous solution to obtain the required
Al2O3 sol–gel. The NCM 622 active materials
were washed first with DI water to remove the residue surface alkaline.
Then, 50.0 g of the NCM 622 material was mixed with 20 mL of the Al2O3 sol–gel under stirring. After drying
at 80 °C under vacuum, the powder was sintered at 550 °C
for 5 h with a heating rate of 2 °C min–1.
For comparison, pure sol without the PVA additive was also used as
a coating solution. The coating and sintering procedure was the same
as above.

Material Analysis
The morphology, microstructure, and
chemical composition of NCM622 cathode materials were characterized
by field emission SEM (Zeiss Merlin, Germany) with EDX, TEM (FEI,
Titan300 KV) equipped with high-angle annular dark-field scanning
TEM , and ICP–mass spectrometry (Agilent), respectively. Powder
XRD data were collected over the 2θ range 10°–80°
on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ
= 1.5406 Å, 40 kV/40 mA). The refinement of the XRD data was
performed using the Fullprof software. XPS analyses were carried out
on a Kratos Supra spectrometer using an Al Kα monochromatic
irradiation (1486.6 eV) at a working pressure smaller than 7 ×
10–8 bar. Depth profiling was carried out using
Ar ion beam sputtering with 500 eV. The sputtering rate was equivalent
to 0.26 nm/s on Ta2O5.

Electrode Preparation and
Battery Assembly
The pristine
or Al2O3-coated NCM622 powder, conductive carbon
(SP and KS-6), and poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) were mixed by
a weight ratio of 90:4:6 in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidine
(NMP, Sigma-Aldrich). Graphite, super P, and PVDF were mixed with
the weight ratio of 92:2:6 in NMP. These two kinds of mixtures were
both mixed for 20 min using a Thinky AR-100 planetary mixer, and then
the uniform slurry of NCM and graphite was cast on Al (cathode) and
Cu foil (anode), respectively. The cathode and anode electrodes were
dried at 120 and 90 °C, respectively, in vacuum for 6 h, and
the loading density of active materials in cathode and anode electrodes
was controlled around at 9.0 and 6.0 mg cm–2, respectively.
The battery was assembled inside the Ar-filled glovebox using a 2032-type
coin cell, which consists of the NCM-622 cathode, lithium or graphite
anode, Celgard 2320 separator (USA), and 1.0 M LiPF6 in
EC/EMC (3:7 by weight) with 2 wt % VC as the additive.

Electrochemical
Measurements
The galvanostatic tests
were conducted using the Neware Instrument (China) in the voltage
range of 3.0–4.55 V for half batteries and 2.75–4.5
V for full batteries at room temperature. EIS measurements were completed
on the electrochemical station Bio-Logic VMP3. All the batteries were
measured under 50% DOD. For the EIS results of cycled graphite and
NCM622 electrode, the full battery was discharged to 2.75 V after
desired cycles and then disassembled in the glovebox. Then, the cycled
graphite and NCM622 electrode were taken out and reassembled as a
new half battery directly (without washing) using the lithium foil
as the counter electrode. This type of battery aims to measure the
remaining capacity and resistance of the cycled graphite and NCM622
electrode. EIS of the two half-cells was also measured at 50% DOD
after one charge/discharge cycle.

HPPC was conducted during
the cycling test, in which a 10 s 3.0 C discharge pulse and a 2.25
C regenerative charge pulse current were applied to the cells. There
were 40 s rest periods between discharge and regenerative pulses.
The pulse profiles were measured at every 10% DOD. The ASI as a function
of DOD was established by calculating the voltage changes during pulses.
