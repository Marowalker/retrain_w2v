An epoxy curing agent polyether aliphatic
polymerized amide (PEAPA)
was synthesized using epoxy fatty acid methyl ester and diethylenetriamine.
The Fourier transform infrared spectra and 1H NMR analysis
indicated successful synthesis of PEAPA. Gel permeation chromatography
showed a high degree of polymerization. The obtained PEAPA was used
to cure E51 epoxy resin and partially replace rigid 1,3-cyclohexanediamine
curing agent. A series of epoxy resins with varying rigidities were
prepared. The mechanical and thermal properties of the materials were
analyzed. Mechanical property tests showed that the tensile strength
and hardness of the materials decreased gradually with increased PEAPA
content. However, elongation at breaks of the prepared materials increased
with increased PEAPA content. Micromorphological investigation indicated
excellent compatibility between PEAPA and the curing system. Furthermore,
a dynamic mechanical thermal analysis demonstrated that the glass
transition temperature of the epoxy resin decreased with increased
PEAPA content. Thermal stability, while still excellent, decreased
slightly with the addition of PEAPA. At the primary weight loss stage,
initial decomposition temperatures for all resins were above 330 °C.

1 Introduction
As traditional thermosetting
polymers, epoxy resins have many uses,
including as adhesives, semiconductor laminates, and insulators for
electric devices. The resins have excellent adhesive, mechanical,
and electrical properties. In addition, they offer low-cure shrinkage
and excellent moisture and chemical resistance.1−3 However, the
application of epoxy-cured materials is limited in that they crack
easily, are inherently brittle, and exhibit poor elongation upon curing.
Therefore, great effort has been made to toughen these materials.4,5

Several chemical or physical means of modification have been
advanced
to toughen epoxy resins, including particulate, elastomer, and thermoplastic
modifications.6,7 Toughening by chemical means could
improve the mechanical and thermal properties through the formation
of strong covalent bonds, but physical blending depends only on the
marginal toughening effect. Thus, many attempts have been made to
design epoxies with suitable molecular structures and to synthesize
flexible curing agents to toughen epoxy resins.8 For example, a novel aromatic amine bis(4-nonyl-2,5-diamine-penoxyl)alkylate
(RAn) was prepared as a curing agent for epoxy resins materials by
a three-step process using nonyl-phenol and dibromoalkylate.9 A novel amine with a flexible polyoxypropylene
chain was synthesized with various molecular weights and used to cure
the diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A.10 A
polyurethane (PU) prepolymer, based on hydroxyl-terminated polyester
resin, was synthesized and used to modify epoxy resins of various
concentrations.11 Polyesters prepared by
direct polycondensation from bisphenol A and aliphatic dicarboxylic
acids (adipic, sebacic, and dodecanoic acids) have been used to improve
the toughness of the diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A.12 In addition, three types of polyurethane (i.e., polycarbonate-type
PU, polyether-type PU, and polycarbonate–polyether-type PU)
prepolymers were used to modify epoxy resin.13 Lou synthesized a series of imidazole (MI)-blocked 2,4-toluene diisocyanate
(TDI) with polyethylene glycol (PEG-400) as the soft segment (PEG-MI-b-TDI) for toughening and curing the bisphenol A type epoxy
resin (E-44). The E-44 cured by PEG-MI-b-TDI was
toughened without sacrificing the tensile shear strength.14

On the other hand, recently, considerably
attention has been paid
to prepare novel polymers from renewable resources to replace petroleum-based
products in response to fossil fuel depletion and the need for environmental
protection.15 Vegetable oils may offer
an ideal alternative to chemical feedstocks. For example, a novel
vegetable oil-based polyamine was prepared from grapeseed oil using
cysteamine chloride by thiol-ene coupling and used as a curing agent
for the bio-based epoxy resin.16 Huang
synthesized three C21-based reactive polyamides from tung oil, as
displayed in Figure 1a, which were then used as curing agents to prepare toughened epoxies.
It was found that the cured materials were superior in tensile and
flexural strength to those cured by C36-based polyamides. The flexural
modulus of the epoxies cured by C21-based polyamides was also superior
to those cured by C36-based polyamides.17 Two rosin-based curing agents containing imide groups were synthesized.
For comparison, an imide-diacid derived from trimellitic anhydride
was also prepared. The glass transition temperatures, as well as the
tensile and dynamic mechanical properties, of the cured epoxy resins
were significantly improved over the imide-diacid cured epoxy resin.18 A light colored cardanol-based epoxy curing
agent was synthesized with markedly improved toughness and shear strength
and also displayed in Figure 1b.19 We also used epoxy fatty acid
methyl ester (EFAME) to prepare an epoxy curing agent. EFAME contains
multiple active epoxy groups and is derived from vegetable oil. EFAME
is a renewable plasticizer, compatibilizer, dispersing agent, surfactant,
and softener due to its sustainable production and reasonable costs.20,21 In the past decade, the use of EFAME rapidly developed, according
to several research groups. The main objective of this work was to
prepare a flexible polyether aliphatic polymerized amide (PEAPA) epoxy
curing agent using EFAME. We propose an epoxy ring-opening polymerization
and amidation method to prepare PEAPA. EFAME is an environment friendly
chemical raw material. Because this epoxy curing agent is prepared
using vegetable oil, it offers reduction in environmental pollution
and fossil fuel dependence.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Gel Permeation
Chromatography Analysis
Figure 2 shows the
gel permeation chromatography curves of prepared PEAPA with various
degrees of polymerization. Gel permeation chromatography analyses
showed that each of the target products was highly polymerized. Polymerization
of PEAPA increased with the addition of BF3·OEt2. When more than 0.50 wt % (0.67, or 1.00 wt %) BF3·OEt2 was added, the number-average molecular weight
of the copolymerized system reached very high levels (hundreds of
thousands) and the viscosities were high, which could limit the preparation
and application of PEAPA. With the addition of less than 0.50 wt %
(0.33 wt %) BF3·OEt2, polymerization was
very low, with a number-average molecular weight (Mn) of only 2307. With the addition of 0.50 wt % BF3·OEt2, the molecular weight of the three obvious
peaks was 700, 1007, and 1450 respectively, corresponding to the theoretical
molecular weights of dimer, trimer, and tetramer in PEAPA. For the
overall analysis, the Mn of the 0.50 wt
% BF3·OEt2 polymerized system was 3599,
which is very close to the PEAPA of 10 polymers. Thus, we selected
the 0.50 wt % copolymerized system for further study.

analysis of PEAPA.

2.2 Fourier
Transform Infrared Spectroscopy Analysis
Figure 3 shows the
infrared spectra of EFAME, PFAME, and PEAPA. The EFAME spectrum shows
that the antisymmetric stretching vibration of the epoxy group appeared
in 1013.9 and 834.6 cm–1. Furthermore, the EFAME
spectrum shows peaks at 1195.5 and 1168.6 cm–1 that’s
behind the overlapped stretching vibrations of the C–O of ester
and epoxy groups. In PFAME, the peaks at 3501.5 and 1076.8 cm–1 arise from the stretching vibration of hydroxyl and
ether bonds, respectively. This indicates ring opening polymerization.
Meanwhile, PFAME with a excellent degree of polymerization can be
demonstrated by the emergence of a peak at 3531.8 cm–1.

Figure 3 Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analyses of EFAME, PFAME, and
PEAPA.

In PEAPA, the peak at 1646.6 cm–1 is attributed
to the C=O of the amide groups. The peak at 1739.5 cm–1 corresponding to the C=O of −COOR–, which exists
in the infrared spectrum of PFAME, almost disappears. The amidation
between PFAME and diethylenetriamine was confirmed in three ways.
First, it was confirmed by the appearance of a C=O stretching
absorption peak at 1646.6 cm–1. The appearance of
a strong, broad characteristic absorption peak of the −N–H
stretching vibration at 3289.1 cm–1 was the second
confirmation. The third confirmation was from an absorption peak of
the C–N stretching vibration at 1071.9 cm–1. The weak peak at 3071.1 cm–1 is attributed to
the stretching vibration of N–H in the associative state of
the cis-anticoexistence secondary amide. The peak at 1550.3 cm–1 is attributed to the bending vibration of N–H
on the secondary amide. The peaks at 2921.8 and 2851.7 cm–1 are attributed to the C–H stretching vibration absorption
of −CH2 and −CH3.

2.3 1H NMR Analysis
The molecular
structures of EFAME, PFAME, and PEAPA were detected with 1H NMR analysis. Figure 4 shows the 1H NMR spectra of EFAME, PFAME, and PEAPA.
There are many lapped peaks in the 1H NMR spectra of EFAME,
PFAME, and PEAPA because of the complexity of the raw material and
finished product. In the 1H NMR spectrum of EFAME, the
peaks of methine protons on the epoxy groups appear at 3.10–2.90
ppm. The main characteristic peaks at about 1.55 ppm correspond to
the methylene protons adjacent to two epoxy groups, whereas the characteristic
peaks at about 1.72 ppm are attributed to the methylene protons adjacent
to two epoxy groups.

Figure 4 1H NMR spectra of EFAME, PFAME, and PEAPA.

The PFAME spectra shows characteristic
peaks at 3.68–3.65
ppm corresponding to the methine protons on the generated ether bonds
of the −CH–O–CH– group. The complexity
of this peak indicates a number of protons adjacent to oxygen atoms.
The overlapped peaks at about 1.60 ppm correspond to the methylene
protons adjacent to the newly formed ether bonds and the methylene
protons adjacent to carbonyl groups in mesoposition. In addition,
the peaks of the methylene and methine protons corresponding to the
epoxy groups have disappeared, which confirmed the ring-opening polymerization
of the epoxy groups.

The PEAPA 1H NMR curves had
characteristic peaks at
2.85–3.15 ppm corresponding to methylene and methine protons
adjacent to −NH or −NH2 groups. The newly
formed characteristic peaks at 1.49 ppm are related to the protons
on NH and −NH2 groups, and the intensity of the
overlapped peaks at 3.68–3.65 ppm clearly decreased due to
the disappearance of −CH3 groups. The results of 1H NMR analysis show that PEAPA was synthesized successfully.

2.4 Tensile Properties
Figure 5 shows typical tensile stress–strain
curves of the prepared epoxy-cured materials. These stress–strain
curves indicate flexible tensile behavior with no yield stress point,
indicating that the prepared epoxy materials are all flexible. The
tensile strength and hardness of the epoxy materials generally decreased
with increased PEAPA. However, the elongation at break increased with
increased PEAPA content, indicating that epoxy materials containing
PEAPA had good flexibility. The tensile strength and elongation at
the break of the epoxy materials are determined by the chemical structures
and state of cross-linking curing systems, which also change with
the amount of curing agent used.22 The
PEAPA molecule contains multiple ether bonds and a flexible chain
alkyl group, which enables the mixed curing agents to have outstanding
curing capabilities and improves the flexibility of the cured system
(Table 1).

Figure 5 Tensile stress–strain
curves of the various epoxy-cured
systems.

and Hardness Data

PEAPA90/CHDA10	16.59	9.98	76	
PEAPA100	15.54	13.20	73	
The tensile tests showed
that the mechanical properties are dominated
by the polyether chains from PEAPA. More PEAPA in the system means
greater flexibility. When the PEAPA curing ability is above 70%, chemical
structure is the main factor influencing the materials’ breaking
elongation and their tensile strength; therefore, the PEAPA70/CHDA30
cured system had high tensile strength (37.54 MPa) with low elongation
at a break of 5.00%. With 100% PEAPA, the elongation at break reached
13.20% but the tensile strength was only 15.54 MPa, likely because
the curing and epoxy material system exists in many ether bonds and
long aliphatic chains, which endows the materials with very high flexibility.

2.5 Morphological Properties
Figure 6 depicts the scanning
electron microscope (SEM) images of the tensile fracture surface of
the epoxy materials. The relatively smooth fracture shows that the
curing agents formed a perfect cross-linked structure with the E51
epoxy resin after cross-linking polymerization and formed the continuous
phase of materials, which indicated the excellent compatibility of
the mixed curing systems. There were significant differences in the
tensile fracture surfaces of the samples. The fracture surface of
the PEAPA50/CHDA50-cured system had irregular broken cracks and abundant
scaly fragments. The rough fracture surface might be attributed to
more ring structures in the material. Under external force, the stress
extended in multiple directions until it broke due to its greater
strength and rigidity. As a result, the fracture surface presented
an irregular scaly crack and was not in a plane state. With the reduction
of the rigid structure in the PEAPA70/CHDA30 cured system, the fracture
surface of the material showed a less scaly structure than the PEAPA50/CHDA50-cured
system. As shown in Figure 6c, the fracture surface of the PEAPA90/CHDA10 cured system
showed a gully state, which is attributed to the flexible fatty chain
structure. With the more flexible chain structure, the free motion
of the chain segments increased. Under external tension, the free
segments were arranged in an orderly way along the direction of tension.
When the external tension increased, the material started to break
and showed the fracture characteristics of an elastomer. Figure 6d shows an orderly
strip structure on the fracture surface. The samples were arranged
in a regular manner along the direction of tension at the beginning
of the stretching process because of its excellent toughness. Eventually,
the sample began to tear in the direction of the stress and attained
a relatively regular strip fracture-surface structure.

fracture surfaces of the epoxy materials.

2.6 Dynamic
Mechanical Analysis (DMA)
The dynamic mechanical behaviors
of the samples were studied. In Figure 7, the dynamic mechanical
analysis curves, including loss factors (tan δ) and storage
modulus (E′), are studied. In our study, the
cross-linking density (νe) was determined by DMA
analysis with rubber theory as follows.23,24 1  where E′ is the storage
modulus of the rubber state (MPa), νe is the cross-linking
density (mol m–3), R is the ideal
gas constant (8.314 J mol–1 K–1), and T is the temperature in Kelvin (K).

Figure 7 Dynamic mechanical
analysis traces of epoxy materials with various
curing systems. (a) E′ curves of epoxy resins
with different curing systems; (b) tan δ curves of epoxy
resins with different curing systems.

To ensure that each sample is in a rubber state, Tg + 30 K was removed as the temperature used
in the calculation.
The cross-linking density of each sample is shown in Table 2.

Table 2 νe of the Cured Sample
sample	Tg + 30 (K)	E′ at Tg + 30 (MPa)	νe (mol m–3)	
PEAPA50/CHDA50	388.31	15.30365	1580	
PEAPA70/CHDA30	366.70	3.03796	332	
PEAPA90/CHDA10	366.11	5.48874	601	
PEAPA100	365.82	7.68763	842	
As shown in Figure 7b, the E′ of the PEAPA50/CHDA50-cured
system
was much higher than that of other cured systems. This may be because
the PEAPA50/CHDA50-cured system possesses a much higher cross-linking
degree than that of the other cured systems, which is in accordance
with the data of νe in Table 2. All E′ curves showed
the same tendency: E′ decreases sharply in
two stages from −45 to 15 °C and from 40 to 60 °C.
At low temperature, the materials were in a glassy state, in which
case, all of the molecular segmental motions were frozen, and thus E′ remained above 2000 MPa. With increasing temperature,
the frozen segmental structure began to relax. All tan δ
curves showed a single peak, indicating the excellent compatibility
of the mixed curing systems. The intensity of the tan δ
peaks increased with the PEAPA content, indicating that more flexible
long-chain structures improved the chain-sliding ability of the cured
system, and thus the tan δ curves showed broad peaks.
With the increase of the PEAPA content, the energy needed to relax
the molecular chains of each cured component was less, resulting in
a temperature decline corresponding to the tan δ peak
(Tg). Therefore, materials with the highest
PEAPA (100% curing ability) content had the lowest Tg (62.67 °C). In addition, the Tg of the PEAPA50/CHDA50-cured system (85.16 °C) was
much higher than that of the other cured systems. As shown in Table 2, the PEAPA50/CHDA50-cured
system possesses much higher νe, resulting in a significant
improvement of Tg.

2.7 Thermal
Stability Analysis (TGA)
The TGA curves of the cured epoxy
materials in nitrogen (N2) are shown in Figure 8. The cured samples had similar
thermal TGA curves; all curves displayed
one-stage degradation behavior in N2. The obvious weight
loss in a range from 330 to 450 °C was attributed to the decomposition
of amidogens and carbon–carbon bonds and the decreased cross-linking
density of the cured epoxy resin. In addition, as shown in Table 3, the initial decomposition
temperature decreased slightly with increased PEAPA. This was attributed
to the improved thermal stability resulting from the reduction in
the number of ring structures in the system. In general, the char
yield of the material was inversely proportional to hydrogen content.
The char yield of the epoxy-cured materials decreased with increased
PEAPA. This was attributed to the increased methyl and methylene in
PEAPA and the lower number of ring structures with the reduction of
1,3-cyclohexanediamine (CHDA) in the whole system. At the main weight
loss stage of heating, initial decomposition temperatures were all
above 330 °C, indicating that all PEAPA-modified epoxy materials
had excellent thermal stability.

PEAPA/CHDA.

3 Conclusions
FTIR and 1H NMR analyses demonstrate
that a new type
of PEAPA epoxy curing agent was synthesized successfully. Gel permeation
chromatography (GPC) analysis showed that the target product had a
high degree of polymerization. The even dispersion of PEAPA on the
tensile fracture surface showed good compatibility between PEAPA and
the curing system. The weight ratios of PEAPA in the curing system
significantly affected the mechanical properties of the produced epoxy
materials. The dynamic mechanical analysis showed a result similar
to the micromorphologic investigation, and the changing trendency
of Tg shows perfect compatibility of the
mixed curing systems. TGA indicated excellent thermal stability in
the PEAPA-modified epoxy curing systems. In our study, the prepared
PEAPA curing agent contained long flexible chain segments that can
be bonded to the dense cross-linking network of the epoxy resin and
thus the toughness of the epoxy system was significantly improved.

at 70–80 °C in the water bath, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00, or 1.50
g of BF3·OEt2, were slowly charged into
the mixture. The weight ratios of BF3·OEt2 to EFAME were 0.33, 0.50, 0.67, and 1.00 wt %, respectively. The
reacting system was adjusted and controlled at 45 °C. After the
reaction of 2 h, 2 mL of ethanol–H2O (1:1) was added
to the reaction to deactivate the catalyst. Finally, a highly viscous

Pour the
epoxy resin E51 and the mixed curing agent into the mold for the specific
tensile test. Tensile properties were studied according to GB/T 2567-2008.
The tensile samples were tested by a CMT4303 universal test machine
(SANS, China). The tensile test speed was 10 mm min–1. The test region of the samples was 4.00 ± 0.10 mm thick, 10
± 0.10 mm wide, and 50 ± 0.50 mm long. Both the tensile

(SEM; Hitachi, Japan) under conventional secondary electron imaging
conditions at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV.

4.3.6 Dynamic Mechanical Analysis
The
storage modulus (E′) and loss factor (tan δ)

test mode. All samples had a dimension of 40 mm × 5 mm ×
1 mm and were tested from −70 to 120 °C at a heating rate
of 3 °C min–1 and a frequency of 1 Hz.
