Nanoscale-patterned azobenzene thin films were incorporated
in
organic solar cells to scatter incident light, thus increasing the
optical path length of photons inside the active area. This ultimately
led to significant power conversion efficiency (PCE) enhancements
in the active layer. Specifically, the azobenzene thin films were
patterned with two-dimensional crossed surface relief gratings inscribed
via laser interference lithography. The patterned films were then
bleached and thermally stabilized by exposure to strong ultraviolet
light before being incorporated in P3HT:PC61BM and PTB7:PC61BM solar cells. The fabricated solar cells exhibited a PCE
enhancement of 133%, from 1.37 to 3.19%, for P3HT:PC61BM
solar cells, and a PCE enhancement of 302%, from 0.53 to 2.13%, for
PTB7:PC61BM solar cells.

1 Introduction
Consumption of fossil
fuel has been rising exponentially since
the beginning of the twentieth century.1 While it is possible that the reserves of fossil fuel will continue
to grow as a result of continued exploration, the depletion of this
source of energy is a lesser problem than the negative long-lasting
effects resulting from its combustion. These include adverse consequences
to human health and the threat of global climate change.2 These facts call for a greater emphasis on identifying
and implementing alternative sources of energy such as solar energy.
However, the performance of conventional inorganic solar cells has
now reached a steady state with only minor improvements in the last
20 years. Some multijunction cells have progressed to PCE values beyond
30%; however, their cost is commercially not advantageous.3 Polymer organic solar cells offer many advantages
compared to their inorganic counterparts, such as short energy payback
times, low environmental impact during manufacturing, low cost and
ease of fabrication, mechanical flexibility, and versatility of the
chemical structure,4 but their relative
low efficiency still limits their practical use and they have yet
to reach the point of commercialization.

Organic polymer solar
cells were developed in the 1980s and consisted
of a single absorbing polymer sandwiched between two electrodes, resulting
in efficiencies below 0.1%.5 The first
pioneering work on polymer solar cells was the introduction by Tang
in 1986 of a second organic layer, resulting in a bilayer cell with
donor and acceptor layers that brought the efficiency to around 0.9%.6 The next breakthrough came with development by
Yu et al.7 of a bulk-heterojunction structure
by mixing soluble polymers and fullerenes to create a network of electron
donor and acceptor materials. While early solar cells used poly[2-methoxy-5-(3,7-dimethylocxylogy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene]
(MDMO-PPV) as a polymer, the introduction of P3HT polymers saw an
efficiency increase when used in conjunction with the fullerene derivative
PC61BM to around 4% due to a better absorption of visible
light up to wavelengths of 650 nm. Recently, various polymers have
been developed with increasing optical range, such as PTB7, which
has an absorption range reaching 750 nm and was able to achieve a
maximum efficiency of 9.2% when used with the fullerene PC71BM.6 However, due to low carrier mobility
and short exciton lifetime,8 the internal
quantum efficiency (IQE) of organic solar cells tends to decrease
as the thickness of the active layer increases, thus organic solar
cells need to remain in the thin-film form. This results in low light
absorption limiting the efficiency of organic solar cells. Various
approaches have been suggested to increase the optical absorption
in thin-film organic solar cells, and these include tandem structures,9 plasmonic solar cells,10,11 and ray-optical light trapping systems.12,13 An alternative method to improve light absorption in organic solar
cells is to scatter incident light within the active layer of the
solar cell, thus increasing the chance that photons would be absorbed
and their energy be converted into electrical energy.

The theory
of light scattering from nanostructures in solar cells14 was initially developed for conventional solar
cells where the absorbing film is typically many light wavelengths
thick. With an optically rough interface, the light propagation directions
inside the material are randomized, thus resulting in a much longer
propagation distance inside the active layer, and hence, a substantial
absorption enhancement15,16 is obtained. This theory demonstrated
that absorption enhancement could reach a maximum factor of 4n2, where n is the refractive
index of the active layer.14 By roughening
both the active layer’s interfaces, an optical path length
enhancement on the order of 50 times is theoretically possible, although
in practice, enhancements of approximately 10 times have been reported
in silicon solar cells.17 For thin films,
some of the basic assumptions in the conventional scattering theory
are not applicable, and an absorption enhancement factor of 48n2 has been numerically demonstrated.18 Thus, there is a potential for substantial improvements
in the efficiency of organic solar cells through light scattering.
However, in practice, scattering by surface roughening is normally
not used in organic solar cells as the surface roughness would exceed
the film thickness. Instead, scattering is achieved in organic solar
cells by doping one of the layers with metallic nanoparticles, such
as silver and gold nanospheres.19 Metallic
nanowires,20 nanocubes,21 nanoprisms,22 carbon nanotubes,23−25 and nanocomposites26 have also been used
for scattering light in thin-film organic solar cells. PCE enhancements
of 16%21 and 14%22 have been respectively reported for P3HT:PC61BM and PTB7:[6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric
acid methyl ester (PC71BM) solar cells with embedded nanoparticles.
However, the size, shape, and density of the nanoparticles must be
tuned to the chosen active materials, and the efficiency enhancements
are often limited to a narrow spectral range, typically around 100
nm. In this work, a different approach is explored by incorporating
nanopatterned azobenzene thin films in organic solar cells to scatter
incident light before entering the solar cell active area.

The
photoinduced fabrication of nanostructures in azobenzene polymer
thin films was first reported by Rochon et al.27 in the form of surface relief gratings (SRGs). They noted
that the azobenzene chromophore underwent a trans–cis–trans photoisomerization when exposed to a laser light with a wavelength
in the polymer’s absorption region and that SRGs could be inscribed
in a single-step process using interference lithography. The optical
inscription of diffraction gratings in azobenzene materials is a single-step
and inexpensive process that can be accomplish in only a few minutes
using a laser with cheap optics. The resulting nanostructures are
stable over time spanning decades, and they can be coated with other
materials, depending on the application. While azobenzene is a popular
material nowadays for the optical inscription of SRGs, as well as
many other applications,28 it has a strong
absorption in the visible spectrum below 600 nm.29 Furthermore, azobenzene nanostructures collapse when heated
above their glass transition temperature, typically around 80 °C.30 These drawbacks limit azobenzene applications
in solar cells as not only would the transmission of light be negatively
affected but also the nanostructures could be destroyed during high-temperature
annealing, which is often required in the manufacturing of organic
solar cells, notably the P3HT:PC61BM heterojunction blend.4 However, an increased transmission of azobenzene
films in the visible range and thermal stability have been reported
after exposure to strong ultraviolet (UV) light.29,31,32 One example was found in the literature
using UV-treated azobenzene surface relief gratings as scattering
centers to improve light emission from organic light-emitting diodes
(OLEDs).33 However, a literature review
did not reveal any published reports on using nanopatterned and bleached
azobenzene films to enhance the efficiency of solar cells. In this
work, azobenzene thin films were patterned with crossed surface relief
gratings fabricated by laser interference lithography and bleached
by prolonged exposure to strong UV light. P3HT:PC61BM and
PTB7:PC61BM solar cells were then fabricated with transparent
bottom electrodes on the opposing side of the glass substrates from
where the azobenzene films are located, a design referred to as double-sided
solar cells for the rest of this work. The solar cells with the patterned
and bleached azobenzene thin films showed significant enhancements
in the current density Jsc and the PCE
compared to the control solar cells. Furthermore, the patterned azobenzene
thin films can be used with different active materials or solar cell
architectures without requiring a redesign, thus providing a versatile
option compatible with mass production.

2 Results
2.1 Effect of the UV Exposure on the Transmission
of the Azobenzene Thin Films
Amorphous azobenzene thin films
were bleached by a strong UV light exposure at a distance of 3.5 cm
from the lamp. The transmission of the bleached amorphous azobenzene
thin films was taken at different exposure times, and it was found
to saturate after 20 h of exposure, as shown in Figure 1a. In this figure, there are two peaks in
the spectrum changing over time, one near 300 nm and the other near
490 nm. The behavior of the first peak corresponds to the reversible trans–cis isomerization process, which first gets
stronger and then decreases as more and more molecules are damaged
from continued photoexposure, while the second peak is associated
with an irreversible photodegradation. The transmission of the azobenzene
thin films was found to also depend on the distance of the sample
from the lamp, as shown in Figure 1b, with better transmission associated with a closer
distance to the lamp. A transmission value of 75% at a wavelength
of 450 nm was recorded for an amorphous azobenzene thin film at a
distance of 3.5 cm to the UV lamp, while a transmission value of only
37% at a wavelength of 450 nm was recorded for a sample positioned
at 6 cm from the lamp. In contrast, an unbleached amorphous azobenzene
thin film has a transmission of only 3% at the same wavelength. Figure 1c,d is photographs
of an azobenzene thin film before and after a 20 h UV exposure at
a 3.5 cm distance from the lamp, respectively. A dip in transmission
can be seen in Figure 1b in the 600–750 nm range for an unbleached azobenzene thin
film patterned with crossed gratings with a pitch of Λ = 450
nm. This is most likely the result of incident light being coupled
in the azobenzene layer. However, this dip disappears for UV-treated
films since the UV exposure also results in a modification of the
surface profile of the patterned azobenzene thin films, making them
more suitable for scattering than diffraction.

Figure 1 UV treatment of azobenzene
thin films. In (a), an amorphous azobenzene
thin film was exposed to UV light at a constant distance of 3.5 cm,
with a prolonged exposure improving the transmission of the film in
the visible region. In (b), azobenzene thin films patterned with crossed
gratings were submitted to a 20 h UV exposure at different distances
from the lamp, with better transmission achieved at a shorter distance.
The images in (c) and (d) are respective photographs of an amorphous
azobenzene film prior to and after a 20 h UV exposure at a distance
of 3.5 cm from the lamp.

2.2 Effects of UV Exposure on the Nanostructures
of the Azobenzene Thin Films
The UV exposure had several
effects on the nanostructures of the azobenzene thin films. The first
effect was the partial destruction of the original crossed SRGs, with
grating modulation depths decreasing to a range between 5 and 20 nm
for bleached samples, compared to the original grating modulation
depths of ∼85 nm, as seen in Figure 2. The grating modulation depth for the bleached
films was found to depend on the distance from the sample to the UV
lamp, which was varied from 3.5 to 6 cm at a constant 20 h exposure,
with better preservation of the grating profiles associated with shorter
exposure distances. The second effect is the apparition of volcano-shaped
nanostructures. It was also found that the lamp distance had a critical
effect on the size of these nanostructures, with maximum heights varying
between 34 nm at a sample–lamp distance of 6 cm and 287 nm
at a sample–lamp distance of 3.5 cm. The impact of the UV lamp
distance on the azobenzene nanostructures of the azobenzene thin films
is discussed in further details in the Supporting Information.

Figure 2 (a) 2D, (b) 3D, and (c) profile of crossed gratings on
an azobenzene
thin film after a 20 h UV exposure. The UV exposure resulted in the
formation of volcano-shaped nanostructures and a partial destruction
of the original gratings. Both effects were dependent on the distance from the sample to the
lamp, with bigger volcano-shaped nanostructures and better conservation
of the gratings associated with shorter exposure distance.

As the gratings are better preserved at shorter
lamp-sample distances,
their partial destruction cannot be due to the sample heating above
the glass transition temperature of the azobenzene film under the
UV lamp. It is more likely that the initial absorption of the UV energy
allows the azobenzene chromophore to undergo a trans–cis isomerization responsible for the partial destruction of the grating,
but the high intensity of the UV light causes an irreversible photodegradation
of the azobenzene molecules, “freezing” the molecules
in place. As the light would be more intense for a sample closer to
the source, the photodegradation would be more rapid, therefore freezing
the molecules in place at a faster rate. One possible explanation
for the formation of the volcano-shaped nanostructures is that the
UV irradiation produces photoinduced surface reorientation and mass
movement of the azobenzene molecules. This would create surface defects,
which in turn would act as seeds for spontaneous surface relief gratings
(SSRGs).34 Crossed gratings are normally
associated with diffraction instead of scattering. However, the UV
treatment of the crossed gratings resulted in partial destruction
of the gratings, with only a minimal modulation depth remaining. Combined
with the apparition of the volcano-shaped nanostructures, the results
are rougher surfaces, which are appropriate for scattering light.

2.3 Thermal Stability of UV-Treated Azobenzene
Thin Films
The irreversible photodegradation of the azobenzene
molecules was also found to increase their thermal stability, as the
degraded molecules would not be able to undergo a cis-to-trans isomerization. Before fabricating the organic
thin-film solar cells on the opposing side of the substrate, the thermal
stability of the UV-treated gratings was verified. In Figure 3a,b, it can be seen that heating
an unbleached azobenzene molecular glass thin film above its 71 °C
glass transition temperature35 results
in total erasure of the crossed gratings by allowing the azobenzene
chromophores to relax back to their trans isomers.36 However, as shown in Figure 3c,d, a 20 h UV treatment resulted in thermal
stability of the nanostructures, with the rms roughness
and maximum height of the nanostructures Rq/Rqmax of the film measured at 4.6/53
nm before heating and 5.1/57 nm after heating. While the thermal stability
of UV-treated azobenzene structures has been previously observed for
maleimide-based copolymers bearing azobenzene moieties,31 a copolymer of 4′-[(2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl)
ethylamino]-4-nitroazobenezene with 2 methacryloyloxy-phenol (polyDR1M),32 and an amorphous polymer containing Disperse
Red 1 (DR1) and cross-linkable acrylic groups as separate side groups,40 this thermal stability effect has never been
reported for the newer gDR1 compound used in this work.

Figure 3 Thermal stability
of UV-treated azobenzene thin films. The 3D images
of an unbleached azobenzene thin film patterned with crossed gratings
are shown (a) before and (b) after being heated at 120 °C for
30 min. The 3D profiles of an azobenzene thin film that patterned
with crossed gratings and submitted to a 20 h UV exposure are shown
(c) before and (d) after being heated at 120 °C for 30 min. Heating
the unbleached azobenzene thin film above its glass transition temperature
erased the gratings, while there was no apparent effect on the nanostructures
of UV-treated films.

3 Discussions
As seen ealier in Figure 1, the bleached azobenzene
thin films still absorbed some light
in the visible range even after a prolonged 20 h UV exposure. The
absorbance spectrum of the P3HT:PC61BM blend thin film
largely overlaps with the absorbance spectrum of the gDR1 thin film,
as shown in Figure 4a. The wavelength range of 350–600 nm contains approximately
90% of the gDR1 thin-film absorbance spectrum, while P3HT:PC61BM has 81% of its absorbance in the same range. Solar cells made
from this blend would therefore be largely affected by the transmission
of the azobenzene thin films. This issue could be subsidiary in a
polymer/fullerene blend less susceptible to the azobenzene absorbance.
For example, PTB7:PC61BM only has 51% of its absorbance
in the 350–600 nm range. Double-sided PTB7:PC61BM
solar cells with patterned and UV-treated azobenzene thin films are
therefore expected to have stronger PCE enhancements, compared to
a control solar cell, than P3HT:PC61BM solar cells with
similar roughness, nanostructure maximum heights, and transmission
of the azobenzene thin film. The J–V characteristic curves of the best patterned P3HT:PC61BM and PTB7:PC61BM solar cells, along with their
respective control solar cells, are shown in Figure 4b. Figure 4c,d show the J–V characteristic curves of P3HT:PC61BM and PTB7:PC61BM with different rms roughness and nanostructure
height values, as detailed below.

Figure 4 Characteristics of double-sided P3HT:PC61BM and PTB7:PC61BM solar cells with UV-treated
and -patterned azobenzene
thin films. The absorbance spectra of a thin gDR1 film, the azobenzene
compound used in this study, and P3HT:PC61BM and PTB7:PC61BM films are shown in (a). Best J–V characteristics are shown in (b) and were obtained with Rq /Rqmax = 3.9/41
nm for P3HT:PC61BM and Rq /Rqmax = 3.6/52 nm for PTB7:PC61BM
solar cells, where Rq and Rqmax are respectively the rms roughness
and the maximum height of the nanostructures of the azobenzene thin
films. The J–V characteristics
of double-sided P3HT:PC61BM and PTB7:PC61BM
solar cells with different Rq /Rqmax values are shown in (c) and (d), respectively.

Control P3HT:PC61BM solar cells without
the azobenzene
layer as well as double-sided P3HT:PC61BM solar cells with
patterned and bleached azobenzene thin films were fabricated as per
the procedures detailed in the Experimental Method section. One sample containing four solar cells was patterned uniquely
by the volcano-shaped nanostructures resulting from the UV exposure.
This resulted in a rms roughness and maximum height
of the nanostructures Rq/Rqmax= 2.1/40 nm. In all other cases, crossed gratings
were first inscribed on the azobenzene films, and then the UV lamp–sample
distance was varied from 5 cm, resulting in azobenzene thin films
with Rq/Rqmax= 3.9/41 nm, to 3.5 cm, resulting in Rq/Rqmax= 14/136 nm. The current–voltage J–V characteristic curves for the
best P3HT:PC61BM solar cells obtained for each of the Rq/Rqmax values are
shown in Figure 4c.
Control PTB7:PC61BM solar cells and double-sided PTB7:PC61BM solar cells with azobenzene thin films patterned by UV
exposure only (Rq/Rqmax = 3.6/52 nm) or a combination of crossed gratings and
UV exposure (Rq/Rqmax= 3.4/34 nm, 9.0/80 nm, and 36/287 nm) were also fabricated
as per the procedures detailed in the Experimental
Method section using varied UV lamp–sample distances.
The J–V characteristic curves for the best
PTB7:PC61BM solar cells obtained for each of the Rq/Rqmax values are
shown in Figure 4d.

The first point of interest in Figure 4b is the J–V characteristics of the P3HT: PC61BM solar cell
with Rq/Rqmax = 2.1/40 nm obtained by patterning the azobenzene thin film by UV
exposure only. The solar cells from this sample exhibited an average
PCE of 1.0 ± 0.6% with the best solar cell having a Jsc of 13.49 mA/cm2, a Voc of 0.58 V, an FF of 0.19, and an efficiency of 1.47%, up
from 1.37% for the best P3HT:PC61BM control solar cell
(average of 0.90 ± 0.06%). With both the average and the best
solar cell efficiencies surpassing those of the control solar cell,
the PCE enhancements are most likely attributed to scattering from
the volcano-shaped nanostructures formed during UV exposure. Since
the azobenzene thin film still absorbed some light even after 20 h
of bleaching, a lower PCE would be expected from solar cells made
with an amorphous layer of bleached azobenzene compare to a control
solar cell made without the azobenzene layer. The increase in the
efficiency of the solar cell with Rq/Rqmax = 2.1/40 nm can therefore only be attributed
to the scattering of incident light by the azobenzene volcano-shaped
nanostructures resulting from the UV exposure, with the scattering
effect slightly overcompensating for the loss in transmission.

To further increase the surface roughness of the azobenzene layer,
crossed gratings were first inscribed on the surface of the azobenzene
films prior to the UV exposure. The double-sided P3HT:PC61BM solar cells with crossed gratings and an Rq/Rqmax= 3.9/41 nm had an increase
average PCE of 2 ± 1% (compared to 0.9 ± 0.4% for the control
solar cells). The best solar cell with this design had a high Jsc of 23.68 mA/cm2 compared to 13.62
mA/cm2 for the best control solar cell, a strong indication
of successful scattering within the solar cell leading to an increased
absorption of the light. It also exhibited an improved Voc of 0.59 V, an FF of 0.23, and an efficiency of 3.19%,
up from 1.37% for the best control solar cell, a significant efficiency
enhancement of 133%. However, a further increase in Rqmax, with Rq/Rqmax= 14/136 nm, resulted in a smaller increase in Jsc of 19.89 mA/cm2, a Voc of 0.58 V, an FF of 0.19, and a PCE of 2.32%. This
effect is probably due to a non-optimized ratio of forward/total scattering
due to the larger nanostructures. There are therefore two competing
requirements: while a high transmission and an increased roughness
(i.e., better preservation of the gratings) are desirable and require
a shorter UV lamp–sample distance, limiting the maximum height
of the volcano-shaped nanostructures is critical and requires a longer
UV lamp–sample distance. Since PTB7:PC61BM has an
absorbance spectrum less susceptible to the azobenzene bleaching quality
than P3HT:PC61BM, it could therefore yield stronger enhancements.

Control PTB7:PC61BM solar cells without the azobenzene
layer were fabricated as per the procedures detailed in the Experimental Method section. The best solar cell
control, PTB7:PC61BM solar cell, exhibited a Jsc of 5.24 mA/cm2, a Voc of 0.49 V, an FF of 0.21, and a PCE of 0.53%, while the
average PCE for the control PTB7:PC61BM solar cells was
0.4 ± 0.2%. The low Jsc of those
solar cells is attributable to the use of PC61BM instead
of PC71BM, which is the fullerene typically paired with
PTB7.37 Furthermore, the additive 1,8-diiodooctane
(DIO) is often normally used with PTB7 to increase the phase separation
in these solar cells, resulting in a threefold enhancement of the
efficiency38−41 and a maximum published efficiency of 9.2%.42 However, for this work, PTB7 was paired with the relatively less
expensive PC61BM. The best results were achieved using
a rms roughness and maximum height of the azobenzene
nanostructures Rq/Rqmax= 3.6/52 nm, a value similar to the best results achieved
with P3HT:PC61BM (Rq/Rqmax= 3.9/41 nm). The solar cells from this
design had an average efficiency of 1.5 ± 0.3%, up from 0.4 ±
0.2% for the control solar cells. The best PTB7:PC61BM
solar cell exhibited a Jsc of 13.97 mA/cm2 compared to 5.24 mA/cm2 for the control solar
cell, a Voc of 0.69 V, an FF of 0.22,
and a PCE of 2.13%, up from 0.53% for the best control solar cell,
a 302% efficiency enhancement. The solar cells with the azobenzene
thin film Rq/Rqmax= 3.4/34 nm also exhibited an increased Jsc and efficiency enhancement, although not as pronounced as the ones
for samples with Rq/Rqmax= 3.9/41 nm, probably due to a lower value of the rms roughness of the azobenzene thin film. The solar cells
with the azobenzene thin films Rq/Rqmax= 9.0/80 and 36/287 nm also showed Jsc and efficiency enhancements compared to the
control solar cells, but it is believed that the enhancements were
limited by the large nanostructures causing a non-optimized forward/total
scattering ratio. The best solar cell with a nanostructure size of
80 nm had an efficiency of 1.56%, while the best solar cell with the
nanostructure size of 287 nm had an efficiency of 1.39%. Table 1 summarizes the J–V characteristics of the solar cells fabricated
during this work.

Figure 5 shows the
enhancements of the Jsc, Voc, FF, and PCE of the P3HT:PC61BM and PTB7:PC61BM solar cells for different values of rms roughness Rq and maximum height Rqmax values of the nanostructures of the azobenzene
thin films. As it can be seen from this graph, in both P3HT:PC61BM and PTB7:PC61BM solar cells, the scattering
of the photons by the azobenzene nanostructures mainly resulted in
an improved Jsc and PCE, with optimal
values achieved with increased rms roughness of the
azobenzene thin films as long as the maximum heights of the azobenzene
nanostructures remained below ∼60 nm. Stronger enhancements
were achieved with PTB7:PC61BM solar cells as PTB7 is less
affected by the azobenzene absorption than P3HT due to a different
absorbance spectrum. Furthermore, it can be noted that the strongest
enhancements were achieved using similar roughness values for P3HT:PC61BM and PTB7:PC61BM solar cells, showing the versatility
of the double-sided solar cell design with patterned and bleached
azobenzene thin films. Once the ratio of forward/total scattering
is optimized, there is no need for redesign of the scattering films
to accommodate different active materials or solar cell architectures.

4 Conclusions
In this work, Disperse
Red 1 azobenzene molecular glass thin films
were patterned by crossed surface relief gratings via laser interference
lithography, and then they were bleached upon exposure to a strong
UV light for 20 h to increase their transparency. The resulting films
were used as scattering centers in double-sided design organic thin
film solar cells with the active layer being either P3HT:PC61BM or PTB7:PC61BM. The UV exposure of the patterned azobenzene
thin films resulted in the partial destruction of the crossed gratings
due to the initial absorption of the UV energy by the azobenzene molecules,
the formation of volcano-shaped nanostructures and, finally, an enhanced
thermal stability of the inscribed gratings well beyond the glass
transition temperature of the azobenzene film. For the fabricated
solar cells, the increase in the optical path length of the incident
photons within the active layer, due to scattering, resulted in significant Jsc enhancements, which are a strong indication
of improved absorption, which in turn led to PCE enhancements. Larger
PCE enhancements were achieved in the fabricated solar cells with
increased rms roughness of the azobenzene thin films,
however the heights of the resulting nanostructures needed to be carefully
controlled to optimize the ratio of forward/total scattering. The
best P3HT:PC61BM solar cell with a nanopatterned and bleached
azobenzene thin film exhibited a high Jsc of 23.68 mA/cm2 compared to 13.62 mA/cm2 for
a control solar cell, an enhanced PCE of 3.19%, and a significant
PCE enhancement of 133%. The best PTB7:PC61BM solar cell,
also with a nanopatterned and bleached azobenzene film, exhibited
a Jsc of 13.97 mA/cm2 compared
to 5.24 mA/cm2 for the control solar cell and an PCE of
2.13%, a PCE enhancement of 302%. The strongest PCE enhancements were
achieved using a similar azobenzene nanostructure roughness for the
P3HT:PC61BM and PTB7:PC61BM solar cells, showing
the versatility of the double-sided solar cell scattering design,
as it does not require redesigning the architecture for different
active materials. Furthermore, patterning the azobenzene thin films
used a process that was cheap, simple, and compatible with mass production,
thus bringing affordable and efficient organic solar cells one-step
closer to wide-spread commercialization. Finally, we have shown that
azobenzene materials can possess versatile optical properties that
make them desirable for incorporating in new photonics devices.

5 Experimental Methods
5.1 Substrate and Solutions Preparations
Soda lime glass slides (no. 2947) (Corning Glass Works, Corning,
USA) were cut to dimensions 3.4 cm × 2.5 cm and were cleaned
with a liquid dish soap followed by a series of ultrasonic baths of
detergent water, acetone, isopropanol, and deionized water for 10
min each, with deionized water rinse between each bath. The slides
were then kept in deionized water until used. Immediately prior to
use, the glass slides were dried in an oven at 120 °C for 15
min and blow-dried with nitrogen to remove any dust particles. Solutions
of Disperse Red 1 molecular glass (gDR1),43 which are made of azobenzene chromophores functionalized with mexylaminotriazine
backbones, were prepared by dissolving 0.18 g of gDR1 in 5.82 g of
dichloromethane (DCM) and shaking the mixture in a mechanical shaker
for 1 h to obtain a 3% wt solution, which yielded 400 nm thick films
when spin-coated at 1000 rpm. A highly conductive formulation of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene:poly(styrene
sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), namely, Heraeus Clevios PH1000 (Ossila, Sheffield,
England), was mixed with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for an hour in
a mechanical shaker to obtain a 5% wt solution with a conductivity
of 677.69 S/cm for a thin film with a thickness of 105 nm. The active
layer consisted of either P3HT:PC61BM or PTB7:PC61BM polymer/fullerene heterojunction blends. The polymers P3HT (SOL4106,
molecular weight (Mw) 50–70 kilodaltons (KDa)), PTB7 (SOL4700M,
Mw 50–100 KDa), and fullerene PC61BM (SOL5061) were
acquired from Solaris Chem Inc., Montreal, Canada. Solutions of P3HT:PC61BM were prepared by first mixing 0.093 g of P3HT in 2 mL
of chlorobenzene (CB) and 0.074 g of PC61BM in 2 mL of
CB inside a nitrogen-filled glovebox. Once sealed and wrapped in an
aluminum foil, the vials were transferred to a mechanical shaker and
shaken overnight. The prepared solutions were placed in an ultrasonic
bath for 1 h to ensure complete dissolution. The vials were then transferred
back to the glovebox, and the solutions were mixed to form P3HT:PC61BM (1:0.8) 25 mg/mL in CB solution, which was shaken again
in a mechanical shaker for 1 h. A similar procedure was conducted
to prepare the PTB7:PC61BM solutions: 0.040 g of PTB7 and
0.080 g of PC61BM in 4 mL of CB were mixed to obtain PTB7:
PC61BM (1:2) 30 mg/mL in CB solution. Finally, the solutions
were filtered with a 0.45 μm syringe filter prior to each use.

5.2 Inscription of Surface Relief Gratings on
Azobenzene Thin Films
Thin films of azobenzene were prepared
by spin-coating 60 μL of the gDR1 solution at 1000 rpm for 20
s using a Headway Research spin-coater (Garland, USA). The cast films
were cured in an oven at 95 °C for 30 min, producing films with
a thickness range between 150 and 200 nm, as measured by a Sloan Dektak
IIA/IID profilometer (Santa Barbara, USA), with a root-mean-squared
(rms) roughness Rq =
0.5 nm and a maximum profile height Rqmax = 3.0 nm, as measured by a Bruker dimension edge atomic force microscope
(AFM) (Santa Barbara, USA). The AFM tip scanned the surface using
a peak-force tapping mode, on a 5 × 5 μm area, with a scan
rate of 1 Hz per line. The collected images were then corrected and
fitted by a built-in 2D plane fit function in the AFM software, which
was also used to obtain the average roughness over the entire scanned
area. The films were then patterned using laser interference lithography
to form crossed surface relief gratings, as depicted in Figure 6. The beam from a Coherent
Verdi V5 diode-pumped continuous wave laser (Santa Clara, USA) with
a wavelength of 532 nm and an irradiance of 416 mW/cm2 was
passed through a 25 μm spatial filter to reduce its Gaussian
profile. The beam was then collimated using a plano-convex lens, and
it was circularly polarized with a quarter-wave plate. A variable
iris was used to control the diameter of the laser beam incident on
a Lloyd’s mirror interferometer, which consisted of a mirror
and sample holder fastened at a 90° angle and mounted on a rotating
platform. The platform was remotely controlled by a LabView program
and a Velmex (Bloomfield, USA) stepping motor controller, which enabled
the adjustment of the laser incidence angle, thus allowing control
of the grating spacing.27 The intersection
axis between the mirror and sample holder was positioned at the center
of the laser beam so that the half of the laser beam was incident
on the mirror’s surface and the other half on the sample’s
surface to create an interference pattern. The grating spacing was
arbitrarily set to Λ = 450 nm for all gratings in this work.
A grating was first inscribed with a laser exposure time of 120 s,
followed by a 90° rotation of the sample with respect to the
vertical plane, and a second grating was inscribed on the same area
with an exposure time of only 55 s. This procedure resulted in the
fabrication of a two-dimensional crossed grating with an approximate
85 nm modulation depth along the first grating vector and 60 nm along
the second grating vector.

Figure 6 Surface relief grating inscription, with a schematic
of the set-up
in (a), 3D AFM image of a linear grating in (b), and 3D AFM image
of a crossed grating in (c). In (a), a lens collimates the laser beam,
which is then circularly polarized before irradiating a Lloyd’s
mirror interferometer, creating a linear surface relief grating on
the azobenzene thin film as shown in (b). The sample can then be rotated
by 90° and a subsequent grating inscribed to create a crossed
grating as shown in (c).

As azobenzene has a strong absorption in the visible
range, the
films were made transparent, or bleached, by a prolonged 20 h UV exposure
using an ORC HmW-6238 mercury lamp (Torrance, USA). No optical components
such as filters or lenses were used between the lamp and the sample,
and the distance of the samples to the UV lamp was varied between
3.5 and 6 cm, resulting in a lamp irradiance between 7.4 and 2.5 kW/m2, respectively.

5.3 Incorporation of Patterned Azobenzene Films
in Solar Cells
Organic thin-film polymer solar cells were
built in a direct structure configuration on the opposing side of
the glass substrate from where the azobenzene nanostructures were
formed, as depicted in Figure 7a. To prevent damage to the azobenzene nanostructures while
fabricating the solar cell, a second glass slide was temporarily fixed
over the azobenzene film with a small gap in between the two slides.
Silver conductive paste was then applied to select areas of the glass
slide surface where the solar cell would be built to improve the anode
and cathode electrode contact points and the entire device was cured
in an oven at 120 °C for 20 min. A single thin-film anode made
of the PH1000 + DMSO mixture was spin-coated over the dried silver
paste inside a nitrogen-filled glovebox at 2800 rpm for 60 s. The
cathode silver paste contacts and the edges of the substrate were
cleaned with deionized water to remove the excess PH1000 + DMSO solution,
and the sample was annealed at 120 °C for 10 min under N2 atmosphere, producing a bottom electrode with a thickness
of ∼100 nm. For the P3HT:PC61BM solar cells, 120
μL of P3HT:PC61BM (1:0.8), 25 mg/mL in CB, was spin-coated
inside a nitrogen-filled glovebox at 1100 rpm for 30 s. The anode
and cathode silver paste contacts were cleaned with CB, and the sample
was annealed at 120 °C for 30 min under N2, producing
an active layer thickness of ∼90 nm. For PTB7:PC61BM, 120 μL of PTB7:PC61BM (1:2), 30 mg/mL in CB,
was spin-coated inside a nitrogen-filled glovebox at 1100 rpm for
30 s. Similarly, the anode and cathode silver paste contacts were
cleaned with CB, and the sample was left to dry uncovered in a nitrogen-filled
glovebox for 2 h in the dark. The additional glass slide used to protect
the azobenzene nanostructures during the fabrication of the solar
cell was then removed. Finally, the solar cell fabrication was completed
by evaporating a 100 nm thick layer of aluminum using a Key High Vacuum
Products KV-301 (Nesconset, USA) physical vapor evaporator controlled
by a Varian Turbo-V 301-AG vacuum controller (Santa Clara, USA) through
an in-house built evaporation mask. The aluminum deposition rate was
kept between 3 and 5 Å/s, as measured using a Sigma Instrument
SQM-160 rate/thickness monitor (Bad Ragaz, Switzerland). The overlap
of the electrodes resulted in four solar cells per sample with active
areas of 8.49 mm2, as illustrated in Figure 7b.

Figure 7 Schematic of a double-sided solar cell, with
the solar cell built
on the opposing side of the glass substrate containing a nanopatterned
azobenzene thin film. A sideview of the solar cell schematic is shown
in (a), and a top-view of the electrodes overlap is shown in (b).

The standard spectrum for measuring terrestrial
solar cell efficiency
is AM1.5G, which is available in ASTM G-173-03(2006).44 The AM1.5G spectrum represents the total power per unit
area that is received at the surface of the Earth at a solar zenith
angle of 48.2° on a clear sunny day. The integral of this spectrum
over the entire spectrum is the input power Pin used in the calculation of solar cells PCE and has a value
of 1000 W/m2. This has become the standard irradiance at
which the efficiencies of solar cells are reported and is often referred
to as 1 Sun condition. The solar cells fabricated for this work were
tested using an in-house built solar simulator composed of an Oriel
66058 xenon arc lamp (Irvine, USA) powered by an Oriel 200 W power
supply (Irvine, USA). To reduce the strong emissions of the xenon
arc lamp in the infrared region and to achieve a closer spectral match
to the standard AM1.5G spectrum, the lamp was paired with an Omega
Optical AM1.5G filter (Brattleboro, USA). To get the standard 1 Sun
illumination testing condition, a Sciencetech 362 power energy meter
(London, Canada) equipped with a Sciencetech 380101 silicon detector
(London, Canada) was used to determine the required distance between
the sample and the xenon arc lamp. Even though the PCE is measured
as a ratio of the maximum output power from the solar cell to the
input power, respecting the 1 Sun standard test condition is important
as, at low light levels, the effect of the shunt resistance of the
solar cell becomes increasingly important,45 and therefore, standardization of the input light intensity for
testing and reporting purposes is required. However, due to the spectral
responsivity of the silicon detector, care was taken during the calibration
of the solar simulator to avoid overestimation of the efficiency.46 The chosen silicon detector can detect in the
wavelength range of 280–1064 nm. This range contains 78.4%
of the AM1.5G spectrum or a total irradiance of 784 W/m2. Using , where P is the power
level read on the power energy meter, and A is the
area of the detector illuminated by the light, the position of the
detector was therefore varied until E = 784 W/m2 was achieved, thus ensuring that the sample actually received
an illumination of 1000 W/m2. With the lamp current set
to maximum, this was achieved at a distance of 25.4 cm. The operating
temperature also has an effect on the efficiency of the solar cell.
While the open-circuit voltage (Voc) decreases
with increasing temperature, Jsc and fill
factor (FF) increase with increasing temperature, resulting in an
overall increase of the energy conversion efficiency.45,46 A cooling fan was therefore added to the solar simulator set-up
to ensure that the standard test condition of 25 °C was maintained.
The solar cell characterization set-up was completed with a variable
iris to control the illuminated area, and a Keithley 2601A System
Source Meter (Beaverton, USA) was used to obtain the current–voltage
characteristics of each solar cell. PCE could then be calculated using eqs 1 and 2:1 1  and 2  where Pmax = JmpVmp is the point of the maximum output power
from the solar cell.
