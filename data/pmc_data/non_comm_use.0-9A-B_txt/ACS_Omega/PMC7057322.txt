Cholera is caused by Vibrio cholerae and is an example of a blood-group-dependent
disease. Recent studies
suggest that the receptor-binding B subunit of the cholera toxin (CT)
binds histo–blood group antigens at a secondary binding site.
Herein, we studied the conformational dynamics of Lewis Y (LeY) oligosaccharides, H-tetrasaccharides and A-pentasaccharides,
in aqueous solution by conducting accelerated molecular dynamics (aMD)
simulations. The flexible nature of both oligosaccharides was displayed
in aMD simulations. Furthermore, aMD simulations revealed that for
both oligosaccharides in the free form, 4C1 and 1C4 puckers were sampled for all but GalNAc monosaccharides,
while either the 4C1 (GlcNAc, Gal, GalNAc) or 1C4 (Fuc2, Fuc3) pucker was sampled in the CT-bound
forms. In aMD, the complete transition from the 4C1 to 1C4 pucker was sampled for GlcNAc
and Gal in both oligosaccharides. Further, we have observed a transition
from the open to closed conformer in the case of A-pentasaccharide,
while H-tetrasaccharide remains in the open conformation throughout
the simulation. Both oligosaccharides adopted an open conformation
in the CT binding site. Moreover, we have investigated the molecular
basis of recognition of LeY oligosaccharides by the B subunit
of the cholera toxin of classical and El Tor biotypes using the molecular
mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) scheme. The O blood
group determinant, H-tetrasaccharide, exhibits a stronger affinity
to both biotypes compared to the A blood group determinant, A-pentasaccharide,
which agrees with the experimental data. The difference in binding
free energy between O and A blood group determinants mainly arises
due to the increased entropic cost and desolvation energy in the case
of A-pentasaccharide compared to that of H-tetrasaccharide. Our study
also reveals that the terminal Fuc3 contributes most to the binding
free energy compared to other carbohydrate residues as it forms multiple
hydrogen bonds with CT. Overall, our study might help in designing
glycomimetic drugs targeting the cholera toxin.

Introduction
There is a strict variation
in the blood group type and frequencies
among the human population throughout the world, which is a result
of the genetic pressure giving protection from different infectious
diseases.1 Among all of these blood-group-dependent
diseases, cholera is one of the deadliest and epidemic diseases in
human history and most prevalent in the African subcontinent. More
than 1.2 million cases were reported in 2017 all over the world, with
a fatality rate of 0.5. Cholera is caused by the pathogen Vibrio cholerae.(2) The
relationship between blood groups and cholera was first shown by Barua
and Paguio.3 People with the O blood group
tend to acquire a higher risk in the development of severe cholera
symptoms.4−7 Further, evolutionary history also suggests an association between
the blood group O and cholera. The Ganges delta is a region where
cholera is prevalent from ancient times. As a result of the genetic
pressure, the O blood group is decidedly less prominent in the Ganges
delta region.8 All of these studies indicate
an active role of the blood groups, especially the O blood group,
in the infection and development of cholera. Despite several experimental
analyses, a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying
this cause is still missing, and this needs to be addressed.9

Throughout the world, cholera infection
can be divided into two
serogroups, O1 and O139. Further, O1 can be classified into classical
and El Tor biotypes.10,11 Both biotypes produce cholera
toxins (cCT and ET CT) differing in two residues of the B subunit,
H18Y and T47I (classical and El Tor). The interaction of the blood
group
with El Tor was observed to be stronger compared to that with the
classical strain.12

Blood group antigens
(BGAs) are cell surface carbohydrates that
are conjugated with glycolipids (e.g., GM1) or membrane glycoproteins
expressed mainly in red blood cells and epithelial cells. The Lewis
blood group antigens are mostly fucosylated glycans and possess a
typical basic structure composed of galactose (Gal), N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), and fucose (Fuc) residues.13 There are four Lewis antigens, namely, Lewis
A (LeA), Lewis B (LeB), Lewis X (LeX), and Lewis Y (LeY). Further, LeA or LeX can often be found sialylated to yield sialyl Lewis A (sLeA) or sialyl Lewis X (sLeX), respectively. For LeX, the sequence of the core trisaccharide is found to be Galβ(1–4)(Fucα(1–3))GlcNAcβ.14 LeY is obtained when a second Fucα(1–2)
is attached to the terminal Gal residue of LeX. All of
these determinants are characteristics of blood group O. An enzymatic
addition of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) or galactose
(Gal) yields A or B blood group, respectively. In this study, we consider
only LeY oligosaccharides, as shown in Figure 1B. Recently, Heggelund et al.15 reported the crystal structure of cCT and ET
CT with LeY blood group determinants, H-tetra and A-penta
BGAs, which opens the possibility of systematic dynamical studies
of interactions between blood groups and cholera toxins. Moreover,
it was shown that H-tetrasaccharide binds to CT with a much higher
affinity in comparison to A-pentasaccharide.

plugin available at www.glycam.org/3d-snfg. A detailed atomic structure is also shown in the ball-and-stick
model, where the standard color scheme is used to depict different
types of atoms.

The interaction between carbohydrates
and the cholera toxin is
highly specific and depends on the conformational variation. The cholera
toxin binds to not only GM1 but also various analogues of GM1.16 A previous study on the interaction of the cholera
toxin with several monosialogangliosides describes the possible binding
modes of carbohydrates to the toxin and elucidates the role of water-mediated
hydrogen bonds that stabilize the interaction.17 Several studies involving different analogues of sialic
acid against the cholera toxin showed that it is successfully recognized
and interacts with the analogues.18,19 Cervin et
al. show that CT can induce toxicity in the absence of GM1 and support
a role for host glycoproteins in CT intoxication. It is worth noting
here that these glycoprotein receptors are fucosylated since human
intestinal epithelial cells are heavily fucosylated.20 Fazil and co-workers have shown by utilizing molecular
dynamics simulations that the binding efficiency of the carbohydrate
units of GM1 receptors varies against different genotypes of CT.21

In this study, we focus on investigating
the conformational dynamics
of Lewis Y oligosaccharides (i.e., H-tetra and A-pentasaccharides)
and elucidating the biophysical basis of their recognition by the
cholera toxin of two biotypes. Previously, various computational methods
have been employed to study the conformational dynamics of glycans.22−29 In general, Lewis sugars behave as a rigid structure in solution
stabilized by the stacking interaction between fucose and galactose
rings.30 In this study, we have utilized
the accelerated molecular dynamics (aMD)31 technique for investigating the conformational dynamics of free
LeY oligosaccharides. We compare the conformational preferences
in solution and bound to CT by constructing the underlying free energy
surfaces corresponding to the glycosidic linkages. It is worth noting
here that the conformational dynamics of H-tetra and A-pentasaccharides
have not been studied previously. Finally, we calculate the binding
free energy of each glycan complexed with both biotypes of CT by employing
the popular MM-GBSA32 scheme, which is
an average estimation of molecular mechanics and solvation free energy.
Since the binding event occurs in aqueous solution,33 MD simulations were conducted in an explicit water environment.

Results
and Discussion
Structural Stability and Flexibility of the
Complexes
First, we have computed the root-mean-squared deviations
(RMSDs)
of backbone atoms compared to the initial structure for all four protein–glycan
systems, and the time evolution of RMSD is shown in Figure 2A. In the case of all four
complexes, the RMSD values quickly reach the plateau and remain stable
throughout simulations, suggesting the convergence of simulations.
The average RMSD is estimated to be 1.2 Å for the classical strain
bound to H-tetra and A-pentasaccharides. Similarly, average RMSDs
of 1.3 and 1.4 Å are obtained when the El Tor (ET) strain is
complexed with the H-tetra and A-pentasaccharides, respectively. The
main reason for the structural stability of the pentameric cholera
toxin could be a conserved intermonomer hydrogen bond.

Figure 2 (A) Time evolution of
the root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs) of
backbone atoms with respect to the initial structure and (B) root-mean-square
fluctuations (RMSFs) of Cα atoms for all four complexes.

Next, we investigated the flexibility of each residue
by computing
root-mean-squared fluctuations (RMSFs) of Cα atoms,
which are shown in Figure 2B. A similar variation is observed for all four protein–glycan
complexes. Further, it is revealed in Figure 2B that the region between residues 51 and
58 is the most flexible region. Another highly flexible region is
located between residues 8 and 12. Both the areas correspond to a
dynamic loop and are solvent-exposed.

Conformational Dynamics
of Glycans Bound to CT
To investigate
the conformational features of glycans, we have calculated the RMSD
of each glycan bound to each monomer of the pentameric cholera toxin
of both biotypes, which is shown in the Supporting Information (see Figures S1–S4). For both biotypes, the
RMSD of each of the five H-tetrasaccharides is very stable (see Figures S1 and S2). In contrast, the RMSD of
A-pentasaccharide is found to be varying and fluctuating (see Figures S3 and S4), suggesting a more flexible
nature of A-pentasaccharide compared to that of H-tetrasaccharide
in the binding site. Such a flexible nature was observed for the LeX trisaccharide bound to RSL.28 In
the case of H-tetrasaccharide, an average RMSD of ∼0.9 Å
is obtained when it is bound to either cCTB or ET CTB (see Table 1). On the other hand,
average RMSDs of 1.3 and 1.6 Å are obtained for A-pentasaccharide
bound to cCTB and ET CTB, respectively (see Table 1). Furthermore, it is evident from Figures S3 and S4 that the flexibility of A-pentasaccharide
is biotype-specific as it is found to be more flexible when it is
bound to ET CTB than to cCTB. An addition of GalNAc monosaccharide
to A-pentasaccharide causes a higher degree of flexibility compared
to that for H-tetrasaccharide.

Further, we analyzed the flexibility of the glycosidic
linkages
for both glycans bound to both biotypes by constructing two-dimensional
(2D) free energy surfaces of φ/ψ glycosidic torsions (see Figures S5–S6, Supporting Information).
Three glycosidic linkages of H-tetra are Galβ(1–4)GlcNAc,
Fucα(1–2)Gal, and Fucα(1–3)GlcNAc, while
four glycosidic linkages of A-penta are Galβ(1–4)GlcNAc,
Fucα(1–2)Gal, Fucα(1–3)GlcNAc, and GalNAc(1–3)Gal.
For constructing the φ/ψ map, we generated a 1 μs
trajectory by extracting the trajectory of each BGA at the five binding
sites and combining such five trajectories (5 × 200 ns). For
both glycans bound to both biotypes, the free energy surfaces are
similar, and we obtained a narrow and single free energy minimum for
all of the glycosidic linkages. In the case of H-tetra, the principal
minima corresponding to Galβ(1–4)GlcNAc, Fucα(1–2)Gal,
and Fucα(1–3)GlcNAc linkages almost coincide with the
corresponding linkages of A-penta. However, the φ/ψ distribution
of the Fucα(1–2)Gal linkage shows a slightly broader
free energy minimum in H-tetra compared to that in A-pentasaccharide.
Moreover, the free energy surface of the GalNAcα(1–3)Gal
linkage in A-pentasaccharide is also found to be a little broad. This
observation suggests that the movements of the glycans get restricted
while they are bound to CT.

Conformational Dynamics of Free Oligosaccharides
in Aqueous
Solution
The flexible nature of the glycan is revealed in
1 μs long aMD simulations. The time evolutions of RMSD of nonhydrogen
atoms for both BGAs are displayed in Figure S7A,B. The average RMSD for both BGAs obtained from the aMD simulation
is reported in Table 1. It can be noted from Table 1 that the average RMSD value of the free oligosaccharide is
much higher compared to that of the oligosaccharide at the binding
sites and is estimated as 3.3 and 3.9 Å for H-tetra and A-penta
BGA, respectively (see Table 1). We have also calculated and plotted the probability distribution
of RMSD for both glycans in Figure S7C,D. It displays a single peak at ∼3.3 Å for H-tetra BGA,
while three peaks at 3.3, 3.7, and 4.7 Å are obtained for A-penta
BGA. Furthermore, the conformational dynamics of both BGAs are illustrated
by the free energy landscape (FEL) of RMSD and the radius of gyration
(Rg) and are shown in Figure S8A,B. It is evident from Figure S8 that in H-tetra BGA, a single broad conformational space
is explored with a global free energy minimum at RMSD/Rg ∼3.3/∼4.6 Å, while the FEL of A-penta
BGA is characterized by three dispersed basins (RMSD/Rg: ∼3.3/∼5.3, ∼3.7/∼5.2, ∼4.7/∼4.9
Å). The global free energy minimum in A-penta BGA is located
at ∼4.7, ∼4.9 Å. In contrast, in the case of bound
H-tetra BGA, the free energy minimum is located at ∼0.8, ∼5.1
Å, as shown in Figure S9. On the other
hand, in the case of A-penta BGA, the global free energy minimum is
located at ∼1.0, ∼5.2 and ∼1.8, ∼5.1 Å
for cCTB and ET CTB, respectively. Overall, this suggests that the
conformational ensemble of A-penta BGA in solution is more diverse
compared to that of H-tetra.

Next, we constructed the free energy
surfaces of the glycosidic linkages for both H-tetra and A-penta BGAs,
which are shown in Figure 3. Overall, Figure 3 indicates a broad sampling around the principal minimum for
all of the glycosidic linkages. On comparing Figure 3 with Figure S5 (Supporting Information), we find out that the locations of principal
minima for all glycosidic linkages are almost similar in the free
and CT-bound states. However, the regions of minima of both glycans
are much broader in solution compared to those in the CT-bound form.
It is worth noting here that in the case of A-pentasaccharide, the
core linkage [Galβ(1–4)GlcNAc] displayed two distinct
minima closely connected by a very shallow free energy barrier (Figure 3D), while a single
minimum was obtained for H-tetrasaccharide (Figure 3A).

Investigating Closed and Open Conformations
of Free A-Penta
BGA in Solution
To further characterize the structural
features, the distances between GlcNAc-GalNAc (R1) and
GalNAc-Fuc3 (R2) for each CTB-bound A-penta BGA are calculated
from the PDB (Protein Data Bank) structure for both biotypes and are
listed in Table S1 (Supporting Information).
It can be seen in Table S1 that R1 varies between 8.9 and 9.4 Å while R2 varies between
9.2 and 9.6 Å for both biotypes. This suggests that A-penta adopts
an extended conformation in the binding site. To explore conformational
preferences of unbound A-penta in aqueous solution, we constructed
a two-dimensional potential of mean force (2D PMF) from the aMD simulation
with R1 and R2 as reaction coordinates (see Figure 4). It is characterized
by two distinct free energy wells separated by a relatively high free
energy barrier. R1 varies between 5 and 9 Å, suggesting
that both open and closed conformations are explored by free A-penta
in solution, which is in contrast to what has been observed in the
CTB-bound X-ray structure. Further, Figure 4 suggests that the open conformation, characterized
by R1/R2: ∼9.4/11.1 Å, is more probable
compared to the closed structure (R1/R2: ∼5.3/9.3
Å). The three-dimensional structures of both conformations are
also shown in Figure 4. The closed structure is characterized by a hydrogen bond between
O5@GlcNAc and O6@GalNAc, which is absent in the open structure. The
extended or open conformation is linear, and all of the terminal fucose
residues are also perpendicular to the main branch. These two different
forms of A-penta oligosaccharide can bind to different targets, as
is the case with Lewis X.34,35 The same 2D PMF was
generated for A-penta BGA from the complex simulations and is shown
in Figure S10 (Supporting Information).
Here, for both biotypes, only the open conformation, characterized
by R1/R2: ∼10/9 Å, is explored.
Overall, our simulations suggest that A-penta can adopt both open
and closed conformations in solution, while only the open conformation
is preferred when it is bound to pentameric CTB.

of mean force for A-penta BGA in solution

GalNac and GalNac and terminal fucose residue (Fuc3) were considered
as reaction coordinates.

Puckering Conformations
of the Pyranose Ring
Next,
we characterized the shape variation of the individual sugar ring
pucker for both oligosaccharides in solution and compared it with
the protein-bound state. The IUPAC convention was used to calculate
the canonical puckering conformations, and the Mercator representations
of the Cremer–Pople sphere36 depicting
pyranose shapes for aMD simulations of both BGAs in solution are shown
in Figure 5. Both chair
conformations (4C1 and 1C4) were sampled for all (GlcNAc, Gal, Fuc2, and Fuc3) but GalNAc monosaccharides,
as is evident from Figure 5. On the other hand, either the 4C1 (GlcNAc,
Gal, GalNAc) or 1C4 (Fuc2, Fuc3) pucker conformation
was sampled in all monosaccharides for both BGAs bound to CT (Figure S11, Supporting Information).

Figure 5 Mercator representation
of the Cremer–Pople Sphere for all
of the monosaccharides in solution derived from the accelerated MD
simulations. Left-hand images (A)–(D) correspond to the GlcNAc,
Gal, Fuc2, and Fuc3, respectively, from H-tetra BGA, whereas right-hand
images (E)–(I) correspond to GlcNAc, Gal, Fuc2, Fuc3, and GalNAc,
respectively, from A-penta BGA.

Next, we computed the one-dimensional (1D) puckering free energy
profiles for all monosaccharides in both BGAs, which are shown in Figure 6. It is observed
from Figure 6A,B that
only for GlcNAc and Gal monosaccharides in both H-tetra and A-penta
BGAs, the complete 4C1 to 1C4 pucker transition was sampled in solution. A similar trend
was obtained by Alibay and co-workers for the Lewis X trisaccharide.14Figure 6C,D further reveals that for both BGAs bound to CTB, only
the 4C1 pucker was sampled for GlcNAc, GalNAc,
and Gal monosaccharides, while the 1C4 pucker
conformation was populated for both fucoses (Fuc2, Fuc3). On computing
the puckering angle ⊖ as a function of simulation time from
aMD simulations of free BGAs in solution, we noted that for GlcNAc
in both BGAs, the 1C4 pucker was sampled more
frequently than 4C1 with significant time in 0,3B, 3S1, and 0S2 (Figure S12, Supporting Information).
Further, Figure 6A,B
suggests that the boat/skewed-boat conformations in GlcNAc are energetically
more favorable by ∼1.5 kcal/mol for H-tetra than for A-penta.
In contrast, for Gal in H-tetra BGA, the 4C1 pucker was more populated compared to 1C4, while both pucker conformations (4C1,1C4) were almost equally sampled in A-penta BGA
(Figure S12, Supporting Information). This
is because the 4C1 pucker in Gal is energetically
more favorable by ∼2 kcal/mol compared to the 1C4 shape in H-tetra BGA (see Figure 6A,B). Furthermore, in the case of Gal, 0,3B, 1S3, 1,4B, and 0S2 puckers were also sampled more significantly
in A-penta BGA than in H-tetra BGA, as these conformations have lower
free energies in A-penta than in H-tetra BGA (see Figure 6A,B). Although both the chair
conformations (4C1, 1C4) were sampled for Fuc2 and Fuc3 monosaccharides in solution with
a short time in the 3S1 shape, the 1C4 pucker conformation was found to be energetically more
favorable than 4C1 for both fucose monosaccharides,
as is evident from Figure 6A,B. In the case of GalNAc, mostly, the 4C1 pucker conformation was sampled with the only optimization
passage to the 1S3 and 1,4B puckers
when A-penta BGA is either in solution or at the binding sites (Figure 6B,D). Finally, Figure 6C,D displays that
the boat/skewed-boat puckers are free energetically unfavorable for
Gal, Fuc2, and Fuc3 monosaccharides when BGAs are bound to CTB.

Recognition of H-Tetra and A-Penta by the Cholera Toxin
Binding Energetics
To elucidate the mechanism of recognition
of H-tetra and A-penta BGAs by the cholera toxin, we have calculated
the total binding free energy and decomposed the same into various
components including electrostatics, van der Waals, polar and nonpolar
solvation free energies, and entropy (see Table 2). The total binding free energy and its
different components for all four complexes are listed in Table 2. Overall, it is evident
from Table 2 that the
complex formation is mainly favored by the intermolecular electrostatic
(ΔGelec) and van der Waals (ΔGvdW) interactions. The nonpolar component of
the solvation free energy also favors the complexation. On the contrary,
polar solvation free energy (ΔGpolar) and configurational entropy (−TΔS) oppose the binding of BGAs to CT.

a All values are
given in kcal/mol.

As shown
in Table 2, the calculated
binding free energies (ΔGbind) are
−4.8, −2.7, −2.6, and −2.8
kcal/mol for cCTB/H-tetra, ET/H-tetra, cCTB/A-penta, and cCTB/A-penta,
respectively. This suggests that H-tetra (i.e., the O blood group
determinant) binds more strongly to both classical and El Tor (ET)
biotypes compared to A-penta (the A blood group determinant). This
observation is in agreement with the experimental study.15 It should be noted that ΔGelec varies between −39.1 and −47.6 kcal/mol,
while ΔGvdW varies between −32.9
and −42.8 kcal/mol for all four complexes. This means that
ΔGelec contributes more favorably
to the complexation compared to ΔGvdW. This is in contrast to what has been observed for HIV-1 protease-inhibitor37−40 or with-no-lysine kinase-inhibitor complexes.41,42 It is also worth mentioning here that for both oligosaccharides,
ΔGelec and ΔGvdW are more favorable for the classical strain than for
El Tor.

In the case of cCTB/A-penta, both ΔGelec (−47.6 kcal/mol) and ΔGvdW (−42.8 kcal/mol) are more favorable for the
binding
compared to the binding of H-tetra to cCTB (ΔGelec = −41.1 kcal/mol, ΔGvdW = −35.4 kcal/mol). However, in the case of
cCTB/A-penta, both ΔGpolar (62.1
kcal/mol) and −TΔS (31.2
kcal/mol) oppose more to the binding compared to cCTB/H-tetra (ΔGpolar = 52.8 kcal/mol, −TΔS = 23.3 kcal/mol). Overall, A-penta binds
less strongly to cCTB compared to H-tetra due to the increased polar
solvation free energy and configurational entropy. However, in the
case of the El Tor strain, a similar binding free energy (ΔGbind = ∼−2.7 kcal/mol) is obtained
for both H-tetra and A-penta.

Quantification of per-Residue
Contributions to ΔGbind
To provide further insights into
the mechanism of recognition of BGAs by CT, we calculated the contribution
of each monosaccharide to ΔGbind for all four complexes, which is listed in Table 3. For all four complexes, Fuc3 and GlcNAc
contribute more favorably to the binding compared to other monosaccharides,
as is evident from Figure 7. The contribution from GlcNAc ranges between −3.1
and −3.9 kcal/mol, while Fuc3 contributes between −8.6
and −8.9 kcal/mol toward the total binding free energy for
all cases (see Table 2). The contribution from Fuc3 in H-tetra BGA accounts for ∼70%
of the total binding energy for both strains, while it reduces to
∼55% in the case of A-penta complexed with either strain (see Figure 7). Further, Figure 7 reveals that GlcNAc
is the next important monosaccharide for the binding for all four
complexes, accounting for ∼25% of the binding energy. Interestingly,
only in the case of A-penta BGA bound to the El Tor strain, the contribution
of Gal (−2.6 kcal/mol) to ΔGbind is significant compared to the other three cases (Figure 8). Gal in A-penta BGA contributes
approximately 4 times more favorably to the binding with ET compared
to the classical strain because of the ∼3-fold increase in
favorable interatomic electrostatic interactions (Tele = −5.5 kcal/mol) relative to classical (Tele = −1.9 kcal/mol). A careful inspection
of Table 3 reveals
that the electrostatic (Tele) contribution
from GlcNAc and Fuc3 to the binding is more favorable compared to
van der Waals (TvdW) interactions and
varies between −6.6 and −12.9 kcal/mol for all complexes.
However, it gets nearly canceled due to unfavorable polar desolvation
free energy (TGB). Therefore, the key
contributor to the binding from these two monosaccharides is TvdW, which varies between −3.4 and −7.6
kcal/mol.

a Energies are shown as contributions

nonpolar solvation energy (np) of the side chain (S), backbone (B),
and their sum (TOT) for CT-BGA complexes. All values are given in
kcal/mol.

Next, we calculated
the contribution of each amino acid to the
binding (Table 4) and
plotted the CT/BGA interaction energy spectra (Figure S13, Supporting Information). A similar spectrum is
obtained for all four cases. We note that H18/Y18, A46 T47/I47, P93,
H94, and Q3′ are important residues for the binding of BGA
and contributed to the binding by ≥−1.5 kcal/mol (Table 4). In the case of
the classical biotype, T47 contributed by ∼−3.1 kcal/mol,
while the corresponding residue (I47) in El Tor contributed by ∼−4.0
kcal/mol. In T47 (i.e., classical), the backbone (TB) contributed more favorably to the binding than the
side chain (TS), while TS is more favorable than TB in I47 (El Tor). Table 4 further reveals that in cases of A46, H94, and Q3′, TS is more favorable than TB for all four complexes. In contrast, TB is more favorable than TS in
P93 for all complexes. Here, it is worth mentioning that TvdW (−1.9 to −3.9 kcal/mol) is more favorable
compared to Tele (−0.2 to −3.5
kcal/mol) for both A46 and H94 and Tele is overcompensated by TGB.

b Energies are shown as contributions
from the van der Waals (vdW), electrostatic (ele), polar (GB), and
nonpolar solvation energy (np) of the side chain (S), backbone (B),
and their sum (TOT) for CT-BGA complexes. All values are given in
kcal/mol.

Subsequently,
we performed the hydrogen-bond (h-bond) analysis
for all four complexes to complement the above results, and the critical
h-bonds between BGA and CT with their occupancies are shown in Table S2 (Supporting Information). It is observed
from Table S2 that H94, T47/I47, Q3′,
and G45 form h-bonds with BGAs for all cases during MD simulations,
explaining high intermolecular electrostatic contributions to the
binding from these residues (Figure S14, Supporting Information). Further, we observe that mainly Fuc3 and
GlcNAc monosaccharides participated in forming h-bonds with CT.

In Figure 8, we
have shown h-bonds between Fuc3 and CT. The h-bond between T47/I47@O
and Fuc3@O4 remains nearly conserved (∼95%) during the simulation
for all four complexes (Figure 8). Furthermore, an h-bond with an occupancy of ∼23–30%
was formed between Fuc3@O5 and T47/I47@N-H. Since h-bonds were formed
with the backbone atoms, TB was found
to be more favorable in T47/I47 than TS. The glutamine residue from the neighboring monomer (i.e., Q3′)
was also found to be interacting with Fuc3 by forming h-bonds with
O2 and O3 atoms of the fucose ring. We complemented the above result
by calculating the pairwise correlation function or the radial distribution
function, g(r), of the water molecules
with respect to the oxygen atoms of individual monosaccharide in the
free (Figure S15A,B) and protein-bound
(Figure S15C,D) states. In the case of
free glycans, the intensity of the peak corresponding to Fuc2 and
Fuc3 is found to be much higher compared to that of other monosaccharides
(see Figure S15A,B). However, in the protein-bound
form, the intensity of the peak of Fuc3 in both BGAs is greatly diminished
(Figure S15C,D), while it remains unchanged
for Fuc2. This is because Fuc3 was found to be involved in forming
multiple h-bonds with the cholera toxin (Figure 8). Finally, for the whole glycan, the distribution
of g(r) is the same, irrespective
of whether the glycan is in the protein-bound or free states.

Overall, Fuc3 is found to be critical in recognizing the cholera
toxin by BGA as the maximum number of h-bonds is formed by Fuc3 with
CT (Figure 8). This
is in agreement with a previous experimental study, elucidating the
role of fucosylated molecules in interaction with CT.43

Conclusions
First, in this study,
we have elucidated the conformational dynamics
of the Lewis Y blood group antigens, H-tetra, and A-penta oligosaccharides,
in aqueous solution using 1 μs long accelerated molecular dynamics
(aMD) simulations. We have also investigated the conformational preferences
of BGAs bound to CT using cMD. Both oligosaccharides in aqueous solution
were found to be flexible. A similar result was obtained for the core
LeX trisaccharide [Galβ(1–4)(Fucα(1–3))GlcNAcβ]
in solution.14,28 The aMD simulations suggest that
the conformational ensemble of A-penta BGA is more diverse compared
to that of H-tetra BGA. Three different conformers with varying populations
were sampled for A-pentasaccharides, while a single conformer was
populated in the case of H-tetrasaccharide. Moreover, the free energy
surfaces of glycosidic linkages for both BGAs obtained from aMD simulations
were found to be broader compared to those of the protein-bound form.

Interestingly, only aMD simulations revealed that A-pentasaccharide
could adopt both open and closed forms in solution (Figure 5), while it takes an open conformation
in the binding site. In contrast, H-tetrasaccharide remained in an
open conformation in solution or bound form. Furthermore, aMD simulations
revealed that for both oligosaccharides in the unbound state, 4C1 and 1C4 puckers were sampled
for all (GlcNAc, Gal, Fuc2, and Fuc3) but GalNAc monosaccharides,
while either the 4C1 (GlcNAc, Gal, GalNAc) or 1C4 (Fuc2, Fuc3) pucker conformation was sampled
in cMD simulations of protein–glycan complexes. In the time
scale of our cMD simulation, the other puckering states were not sampled
due to the high energy barrier caused by the cyclization of the sugar
ring.44 The 1D free energy profile of the
puckering angle (⊖) shows that only for the GlcNAc and Gal
rings in H-tetra and A-pentasaccharides, the aMD simulations sampled
the complete 4C1 to 1C4 pucker transition. In the case of LeX trisaccharide,
the complete transition was observed only for GlcNAc, while only the 4C1 pucker was sampled for the Gal ring.14

Second, we have studied the mechanism
of binding of H-tetra and
A-penta BGAs with the cholera toxin using the MM/GBSA scheme. A relatively
stronger binding affinity was obtained for the O blood group determinant,
H-tetrasaccharide, complexed with both biotypes compared to the A
blood group determinant, A-pentasaccharide. This agrees with the experimental
data. In the case of the CT/H-tetrasaccharide complex, both polar
solvation free energy and configurational entropy were less disfavored
compared to those in CT/A-pentasaccharide, resulting in higher binding
free energy. Per residue decomposition of the total binding free energy
shows that the terminal Fuc3 monosaccharide contributes most to the
binding free energy compared to other carbohydrate residues, and it
forms multiple h-bonds with CT. Overall, our study provides a detailed
overview of the conformational preferences of LeY BGAs
in solution and the protein-bound form and molecular basis of recognition
of BGAs by the cholera toxin, which may further help in designing
a more potent and reliable cholera toxin inhibitor as well as a vaccine
to fight this century-old deadly disease.

Materials and Methods
MD Simulations
of CT-BGA Complexes
We have simulated
the pentameric CT-BGA complexes in aqueous solution using conventional
molecular dynamics (cMD) simulations at 300 K. Initial coordinates
of the four complexes were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB
IDs: 5ELB and 5ELC for H-tetra BGA
with cCT and ET CT, respectively, and 5ELD and 5ELE for A-penta BGA with cCT and ET CT, respectively).15 The missing part of the crystal structure was
built using the University of California, San Francisco, Chimera software.45 In cases where the glycan was missing in the
binding site of a monomer, we placed it by geometrically translating
the glycan from the neighboring monomer. For all complexes, the AMBER
ff14SB force field46 was used for modeling
the protein, and glycam06j-147 was employed
for describing the glycan. All of the systems were solvated using
TIP3P48 water molecules in a truncated
octahedral box, having a 10 Å distance between the solute and
the wall of the box. An appropriate number of sodium ions were added
to neutralize the system. Bonds involving hydrogen atoms were constrained
using the SHAKE algorithm,49 and the long-range
electrostatic interactions were estimated using the particle-mesh
Ewald (PME)50 method. The nonbonded cutoff
was set to 10 Å, and the temperature was kept fixed at 300 K
using the Langevin thermostat51 with a
collision frequency of 2 ps–1. The energy minimization
of the system was carried out in two stages: (i) 500 steps of steepest
descent followed by another 500 steps of conjugate gradient with a
harmonic restraint of 2 kcal/(mol Å2) applied on the
solute and (ii) without any restraint on the solute using the steepest
descent followed by conjugate gradient schemes. After the minimization,
the systems were heated stepwise from 0 to 300 K with a restraint
force of 2 kcal/(mol Å2) acting on the solute. A 50
ps simulation with the restraint of 2 kcal/(mol Å2) on the solute was carried out at a pressure of 1 atm to equilibrate
the density. After that, we conducted 1 ns simulation under the NPT
ensemble without any restraint on the solute. Finally, the production
simulations were carried for 200 ns in the NPT ensemble with a time
step of 2 fs using the pmemd.cuda module of AMBER 16.52−54 We recorded coordinates every 10 ps, resulting in 20 000
configurations.

aMD Simulations of Free Glycans
For better sampling,
we also simulated BGAs in aqueous solution using the accelerated molecular
dynamics (aMD) technique. We equilibrated the solute for 10 ns before
applying the aMD boost to get the average potential energy and dihedral
energy. After that, we used a dual boost potential using the following
boost parameters. For H-tetrasaccharide, dihedral energies Edih = 24.22 kcal/mol, αdih =
3.5 kcal/mol; total potential energy Etot = −13 222.0 kcal/mol; and αtot =
807.1 kcal/mol were used. Similarly, in the case of A-pentasaccharide,
dihedral energies Edih = 16.6 kcal/mol,
αdih = 4.2 kcal/mol; total potential energy Etot = −17 222.6 kcal/mol; and
αtot = 1047.0 kcal/mol were employed. Finally, aMD
simulations were carried out for 1 μs under the NPT ensemble
and the coordinates were stored every 10 ps.

Analysis
All of the trajectories obtained from the
unbiased and biased simulations were analyzed using the Cpptraj55 module of AMBER 16. Glycosidic torsion angles
were defined as φ = O5–C1–O–Cn, ψ = C1–O–Cn–C(n–1) for α/β(1 – n) linkages. The
relative free energy surfaces corresponding to the glycosidic angles
were computed using the expression ΔGx = −kBT ln(ρx), where kB is the
Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and ρx is the probability density of the geometric
coordinate x. As the value of this logarithm function
is negative or zero, the final free energy value remains zero or positive.
The state having the highest probability will always be 1; therefore,
the minimum always stays at zero. For estimating the puckering conformation
of the pyranose rings, we have adopted the generalized pseudorotation
coordinates coined by Cremer and Pople.36 Further, we followed the IUPAC convention to show different puckerings,
which lead to the partition of ⊖ and φ plane in 38 regions.
The one-dimensional free energy surface was also generated using the
already stated Boltzmann formula, taking ⊖ from the puckering
parameter as a reaction coordinate. For aMD simulations, we have employed
the Pyreweighting scripts developed by the McCammon group56 for constructing the potential of mean force
(PMF) surface from the biased potential. This script uses the 10th-order
Maclaurin series expansion to reweigh the total boost energy from
each frame.

For estimating the binding
free energy of CT-BGA complexes, the popular molecular mechanics generalized
Born surface area (MM/GBSA)32 scheme was
used. For protein–glycan systems, it has been shown in previous
studies57,58 that MM/GBSA outperforms the computationally
expensive MM/PBSA.59−61 The MM/GBSA scheme has been discussed elsewhere.37−39,41,62,63 We have used the option (igb = 2)64 within the MM-GBSA framework for all cases.
We extracted the trajectory of a dimer pair with one oligosaccharide
from the pentameric complex trajectory for estimating the binding
free energy. Two adjacent monomers were considered because the ligand
was found to form a stable hydrogen bond with the glutamine residue
of the neighboring monomer (Q3′). We have considered 8000 frames
for computing the binding free energy. The normal mode analysis (NMA)
method was employed for calculating the configurational entropy, and
50 frames were used for the calculation.
