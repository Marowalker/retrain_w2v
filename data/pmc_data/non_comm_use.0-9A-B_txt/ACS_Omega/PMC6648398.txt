As–Sb
dust from metallurgical processes causes serious environmental
issues due to the presence of the toxic element As. In this study,
a facile method for removing As through the destruction of the As–Sb
solid solution structure from the dust using CaO under an oxidizing
atmosphere was processed. The effects of the variables, including
the amount of CaO added, roasting temperature and time, and oxygen
partial pressure, on the volatilization of As and Sb were investigated.
Under an oxidizing atmosphere in the presence of CaO, the formation
of the vitreous material (As–Sb–O) was hindered through
the transformation of Sb2O3 and (As, Sb)2O3 in the untreated dust into Sb2O4, Sb2O5, Sb6O13, and Ca2Sb2O7, and the volatilization
of arsenic was promoted, as a result. The volatilization attained
for As was 91.53% whereas that for Sb was only 4.30% under the following
optimum conditions: 5 mass % CaO, a roasting temperature of 550 °C,
an O2 partial pressure of 21 vol % (air), and a roasting
time of 80 min.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Antimony and its compounds
are widely used in making catalysts,
ceramics, glasses, batteries, paints, firework materials, ammunition,
and fire retardants.1−5 Sb consumption is continuously increasing, whereas natural reserves
of Sb are declining; thus, the recovery of Sb has become a topic of
interest.6−8 In nonferrous metallurgy processes, Sb is mainly
concentrated in dusts and slags together with As due to their similar
chemical properties. This dust cannot be directly used in the Sb smelting
process owing to its high As content.9,10

The
methods for separating As from the As–Sb dust mainly
include pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical processes.11−15 In the hydrometallurgy process, arsenic is selectively leached into
solution and separated from antimony using an acid or alkali as the
leaching medium and a high liquid–solid ratio;16−19 the arsenic removal through these methods can reach over 92 mass
%. However, this process involves the consumption of large amounts
of reagent, and the arsenic-bearing wastewater produced poses a potential
hazard to the environment.20,21 By taking advantage
of the different volatilities of As and Sb compounds, some roasting
processes have been developed. Li et al. and Tang et al. found that
only approximately 60 mass % of arsenic was removed and more than
10 mass % of antimony was lost when the dust was roasted under an
oxidizing atmosphere,22,23 possibly due to the formation
of an As–Sb solid solution during the roasting process.24 The vapor pressure of this As–Sb solid
solution is lower that of As2O3 but higher than
that of Sb2O3,2525 making it difficult to achieve a high As–Sb
separation efficiency. Thus, several recent methods for the treatment
of As–Sb dust using CuO and MnO2 as weak oxidants
have been proposed.26,27 In these methods, the structure
of the As–Sb solid solution is effectively destroyed, and the
arsenic removal rate can reach over 90 mass % with an antimony loss
rate of less than 9%. Most Sb is retained in the roasted residue in
the form of Sb2O4, and the Cu and Mn are retained
in the forms of Cu2O and Mn3O4, respectively.
However, this leads to a new problem for recovering Sb from these
roasted residues through a general reducing smelting process, as the
Cu and Mn will enter the Sb melts, decreasing the quality of the Sb.
Thus, for Sb recovery, metal oxides with oxidizing properties should
not be used.

In this work, a new method for removing arsenic
by roasting the
As–Sb dust under an oxidizing atmosphere using CaO as an additive
is put forward. The influences of processing parameters, namely, the
amount of CaO added, the roasting temperature, oxygen partial pressure,
and roasting time, on the separation of arsenic were investigated.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Thermodynamic Analysis
The contents
of arsenic and antimony in the dust are high (Table 1) and mainly exist as As2O3, Sb2O3, and As–Sb solid solution
((As, Sb)2O3) in the dust.28 As shown in Figure 1, the vapor pressure of the As–Sb solid solution is
lower than that of As2O3 but higher than that
of Sb2O3. Meanwhile, the As2O3 could react with Sb2O3 to form a vitreous
material (As–Sb–O) at temperatures higher than 300 °C.
For these reasons, it is difficult to separate As2O3 from Sb2O3 effectively via a roasting
process under an inert atmosphere. As2O3 and
Sb2O3 could be oxidized to nonvolatile compounds
as shown in eqs 1–3; additionally, the Sb2O3 oxidation
is favored due to the more negative Gibbs free energy values of eqs 1 and 2 compared with that of eq 3(28) Thus, As2O3 can be effectively separated from Sb2O3 via
a selective oxidation process, in which Sb is oxidized and transformed
into nonvolatile Sb2O4 and Sb2O5 remaining in the residue, whereas As is volatilized in the
form of As4O6(g). However, the oxidation of
the “Sb2O3” component in the (As,
Sb)2O3 solid solutions (eq 4) is hindered by the affinity between “As2O3” and “Sb2O3” in (As, Sb)2O3, seen from Figure 2. In Figure 2, these solid solutions were
assumed to be ideal solid solutions, and “Sb2O3” was given an activity coefficient of 1 on the basis
of Raoult’s law. However, by adding CaO, the oxidation of both
free and bound Sb2O3 is promoted, as demonstrated
by the comparison of the Gibbs free energies of eqs 1 and 2 with that of eq 5, and that of eq 4 with eq 6, respectively (Figure 2), and thus the separation between arsenic
and antimony could be promoted from a thermodynamic point of view. 1   2   3   4   5   6  The formation of a vitreous material (As–Sb–O)
would inhibit the separation of As2O3 from Sb2O3.29 The diagram in Figure 3 shows the predominance
of As2O3–Sb2O3–O2 as a function of temperature at different As4O6(g) partial pressures, as calculated using the phase stability
diagram module of HSC Chemistry 7.0 on the basis of the minimum Gibbs
free energy. As shown in the diagram, the Sb(s), Sb(l), Sb2O3, SbO2, Sb2O5, and
1.5As2O3·0.5Sb2O3 phases are obtained at different oxygen partial pressures and temperatures.
It is notable that the stable region of 1.5As2O3·0.5Sb2O3 decreases with the As4O6(g) partial pressure and temperature. Thus, we can infer
that the separation of As2O3 from Sb2O3 will also be accelerated at higher temperatures.

2.2 Effects of the Amount of CaO Added
Conditions of air
atmosphere (21 vol % O2), a flow rate
of 200 mL/min, a roasting temperature of 550 °C, and a roasting
time of 90 min were chosen for studying the effects of the amount
(5, 8, 12, 14, and 20 mass %) of CaO added on the volatilization of
As and Sb. In addition, a control experiment without CaO was also
carried out under the same conditions.

According to eqs 1 and 2, and Figures 3 and 4a, when no CaO is added, some Sb2O3 could be oxidized to Sb2O4 and Sb2O5 under an air atmosphere, whereas the rest will
combine with As2O3 to form the As–Sb–O
phase (Figure 5). The
“Sb” in Sb2O4 contains Sb3+ and Sb5+.30Figure 5 shows that the residue
of the dust roasted without CaO is mainly composed of Sb–O
and As–Sb–O phases and does not contain any free As2O3 phase. The formation of the As–Sb–O
phase obviously restricts the volatilization of arsenic, but promotes
the volatilization of antimony as deduced from Figure 1, as a result of which the Va is only 70.47%, whereas the Vs is up to 35.60% as shown in Figure 6.

Figure 6 Effects of the amount of CaO added on volatilization rates of As
and Sb at 550 °C for 90 min under an air atmosphere.

Based on the data shown in Figures 2 and 4, when CaO was
added,
the oxidation of free Sb2O3 and the “Sb2O3” component in (As, Sb)2O3 in the untreated dust is promoted, which also inhibits the
formation of the As–Sb–O phase. Most of the Sb-containing
phases were transformed to nonvolatile Sb2O4, Sb2O5, Sb6O13, and
Ca2Sb2O7 after roasting in the presence
of CaO (Figure 7),
and massive volatilization of arsenic in the form of As4O6(g) was observed.28 Correspondingly,
the arsenic and antimony volatilization rates increased to 92.69%
and decreased to 6.77% (Figure 6), respectively, when 5 mass % CaO was added. However, as
the amount of CaO increased further, more Ca3(AsO4)2 was formed through eq 7 (Figure 8), causing a decreases in the Va (Figure 6). Moreover, eq 7 is an exothermic reaction
(Figure 9) and will
increase the temperature in the reaction region, which increases the
volatilization of antimony to some extent (Figure 6). Thus, to optimize the separation of arsenic
and antimony, the optimal amount of CaO is 5 mass %. 7

2.3 Effects of the Roasting Temperature
Using 5 mass % CaO, effects of the roasting temperature ranging from
400 to 600 °C on the volatilization rates of As and Sb were investigated
at an air flow rate of 200 mL/min and roasting time of 90 min.

As the roasting temperature increases, the vapor pressures of As2O3 and Sb2O3 increase and
the Va and Vs values gradually increase (Figure 10). Figure 11 shows the structures of the residues roasted at temperatures
of 400 and 450 °C, both of which are noncrystalline based on
the apparent broadening of the XRD peak and are mainly composed of
the As–Sb–O phase. The generation of this As–Sb–O
phase obviously inhibits the volatilization of arsenic, and the Va values are rather low at 17.12 and 20.06%
for roasting temperatures of 400 and 450 °C, respectively (Figure 10). In addition,
the X-ray diffraction analysis results of the roasted residues conducted
with a step of 1° at the rate of one step per minute (the subgraphs
in Figure 11) show
that some Sb phases in the untreated dust have been oxidized and transformed
to Sb2O4, Sb2O5, and Sb6O13 at 400 °C and 450 °C, causing the Vs values to be as low as 4.33 and 6.08%, respectively.
When the roasting temperature was increased above 500 °C, the
noncrystalline structure of the roasted residue was destroyed, and
the generation of the As–Sb–O phase was inhibited due
to the transformation of Sb2O3 and (As, Sb)2O3 in the untreated dust to Sb2O4, Sb2O5, Sb6O13, and Ca2Sb2O7 (Figure 12). The As volatilization rate
(Va) increases significantly from 35.25
to 91.25% when the temperature was raised from 500 to 550 °C,
whereas the Vs changes only slightly from
7.15 to 8.95%. Moreover, the As might be oxidized to As5+ compounds at 600 °C, and the Va value decreases slightly (Figure 10). Thus, the roasting temperature should be fixed at
550 °C to increase the As volatilization rate.

2.4 Effects
of the Oxygen Partial Pressure
The oxygen partial pressure
plays an important role in the phase
transformation of arsenic and antimony during the roasting process,
as shown in Figure 13. In regions of II, III, and V, arsenic exists stably in the form
of As2O3, whereas antimony is present as nonvolatile
Ca2Sb2O7, Sb2O4, and Sb2O5, allowing for the volatilization
and separation of arsenic. When the oxygen partial pressure is increased
to the regions of IV, VI, and VII, arsenic and antimony both exist
as nonvolatile phases (As2O5, Sb2O4, and Sb2O5), as a result of which
arsenic separation is very difficult to be carried out.

Figure 13 Predominance
diagram of the As–Sb–Ca–O system.

Under a N2 atmosphere, most arsenic
and antimony in
the untreated dust remained in the forms of As2O3 and Sb2O3 (region I in Figure 13) and would be combined into a vitreous
material (As–Sb–O) during the roasting process,24 resulting in a low As/Sb separation efficiency
(Figure 14). At an
oxygen partial pressure of 15 vol %, most phases of (As, Sb)2O3 and Sb2O3 in the untreated dust
were oxidized and transformed to Sb2O4, Sb2O5, Sb6O13, and Ca2Sb2O7 (Figure 15), through which the formation of the vitreous material
(As–Sb–O) was hindered. As a result, the volatilization
rates of As and Sb increase and decrease to 91.54 and 9.14%, respectively
(Figure 14). When
the oxygen partial pressure was increased above 21 vol %, some arsenic
phases might be oxidized to As5+ compounds and the Va decreases, as shown in Figure 14. To improve the separation efficiency of
As and Sb, the most suitable O2 partial pressure is 21
vol % (air).

rates
of As and Sb (5.0 mass % CaO, 200 mL/min gas flow rate, 550 °C,

residue under 15 vol %
O2 partial pressure (5.0 mass % CaO, 200 mL/min gas flow
rate, 550 °C, 90 min).

2.5 Effects of the Roasting Time
As shown
in Figure 16, the Va reaches 91.53% at a roasting time of 80 min
and then increases slightly with a longer roasting time, and the Sb
volatilization rate remains almost constant at roasting times less
than 80 min and then increases obviously at roasting times longer
than 90 min. To achieve the aim of improving the As removal rate and
decreasing the mass loss of Sb, 80 min is the most appropriate roasting
time, at which the Sb volatilization rate (Vs) is 4.30%.

Figure 16 Effects of roasting time on volatilization rates of As
and Sb (5.0
mass % CaO, air flow rate 200 mL/min, 550 °C).

Under the optimum conditions of 5 mass % CaO, a
roasting temperature
of 550 °C, an O2 partial pressure of 21 vol % (air),
and a roasting time of 80 min, the volatilization rate of As was 91.53%
and that of Sb was only 4.30%. A high As/Sb separation efficiency
was realized in this process, and the As-containing volatiles could
be collected and used for preparing FeAsO4, which renders
the As harmless.28 Meanwhile, the Sb in
the roasted residue, which existed as Sb2O4,
Sb2O5, Sb6O13, and Ca2Sb2O7, could be reclaimed through a
general smelting process.

3 Conclusions
The effective removal of As from the As–Sb dust by roasting
with CaO under an oxidizing atmosphere was feasible. The amount of
CaO, the roasting temperature, and the oxygen partial pressure played
significant roles in the As separation.

The As could be volatilized
and separated in the form of As4O6(g) from the
As–Sb dust through a selective
oxidation process from a thermodynamic point of view, and, meanwhile,
the Sb was oxidized and transformed into nonvolatile forms (Sb2O4, Sb2O5) remaining in the
residue. Furthermore, the oxidation of the “Sb2O3” component in the (As, Sb)2O3 solid solution in the raw dust has traditionally been hindered by
the affinity between “As2O3” and
“Sb2O3” in (As, Sb)2O3. By adding CaO, this hindrance was alleviated.

A vitreous material (As–Sb–O) could be formed during
the roasting process when CaO was not added and an inert atmosphere
was used; the formation of this material would obviously restrict
arsenic volatilization. By roasting the As–Sb dust at a temperature
above 500 °C under an oxidizing atmosphere in the presence of
CaO, the formation of the vitreous material (As–Sb–O)
could be avoided through the transformation of Sb2O3 and (As, Sb)2O3 in the untreated dust
into Sb2O4, Sb2O5, Sb6O13, and Ca2Sb2O7, and the volatilization of arsenic was promoted. By using the optimum
conditions of 5 mass % CaO, a roasting temperature of 550 °C,
an O2 partial pressure of 21 vol % (air), and a roasting
time of 80 min, an As volatilization rate of 91.53% was achieved,
whereas that of Sb was only 4.30%.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials
The As–Sb dust was
collected from a plant located in the Yunnan province of China, which
mainly treats tin anode slime through a pyrometallurgical process.
The chemical composition of the dust was characterized by chemical
analysis, and the results are given in Table 1. Table 1 shows that the arsenic and antimony contents in the
dust are 36.28 and 28.72 mass %, respectively; thus, the recovery
of Sb is worthwhile. The XRD pattern of the dust is shown in Figure 17; its main mineral
constituents are As2O3, Sb2O3, and a solid solution of (As, Sb)2O3. An electron probe microscopic analysis coupled with energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was carried out to detect the elemental distribution
in different phases of the dust. Figure 18 shows the focal points of analysis in the
raw material, and Table 2 gives the composition of these points. The major phases present
in the dust are determined to include As–O, Sb–O, and
coexistent phases of (As–Sb–O), which was consistent
with the XRD results in Figure 17.

4.2 Roasting
Methods
All of the experiments
were conducted in a horizontal resistance furnace; the schematic diagram
of the experimental equipment has been reported previously,26 which is shown as Figure 19. The samples were roasted using a tube
furnace (GSL-1500X, Hefei Kejing Materials Technology Co. Ltd., China)
under different roasting temperatures, amounts of CaO, O2 partial pressures, and roasting times. The roasting temperature
was precisely measured by a Pt–Rh thermocouple and controlled
using a KSY Intelligent Temperature Controller (accuracy: ±1
°C). Nine grams of the dust was used in each experiment. The
dust was first ground and sieved to yield a grain size below 200 mesh
and then mixed thoroughly with a given amount of CaO. The amount of
CaO to be added was calculated based on the mass ratio of CaO to the
dust; CaO contents of 0–20 mass % were investigated. For the
experimental procedure, the horizontal tube furnace was first heated
to the desired temperature and then cleaned using a preset N2 + O2 gas mixture. The sample boat containing the samples
was weighed and placed in the constant-temperature zone of the furnace
when the temperature reached the set value, and was then held for
the desired roasting time. Meanwhile, the off-gas from the reaction
tube was continuously passed through an As4O6 condenser, which collected the volatile matter, and then directed
to NaOH solutions to remove harmful components. After the desired
roasting time, the sample was cooled under a N2 atmosphere,
weighed once the temperature reached room temperature, and prepared
for analysis.

4.3 Characterization
The samples were
characterized using X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD, Rigaku, TTR-
III), electron probe microanalysis techniques (EPMA, JXA82, JEOL),
and scanning electron microscopy (HITACHI-S3400N) coupled with energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) to study the phase transformation in roasting
processes. The X-ray diffraction study was carried out with the 2θ
varying from 10 to 90° using Cu Kα radiation at a scanning
rate of 8°/min. The chemical compositions of the samples were
analyzed using chemical analysis. The software HSC Chemistry 7.0 was
used to calculate the standard Gibbs free energy changes of the reaction
system. Mathematical expressions for the volatilization rates of arsenic
(Va) and antimony (Vs) were defined as follows  and  where Mt and Mr represent the total mass of the original dust
and roasted residue, respectively; Woa and Wos are mass percentages of As and
Sb in the untreated dust, respectively; and Wa and Ws are mass percentages of
As and Sb in the roasted residue, respectively.
