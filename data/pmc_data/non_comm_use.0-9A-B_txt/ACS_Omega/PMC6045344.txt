The
binding interaction of a biocompatible water-soluble polycationic
two-photon fluorophore (Ant-PIm) toward human serum albumin
(HSA) was thoroughly investigated
under simulated physiological conditions using a combination of steady-state,
time-resolved, and two-photon excited fluorescence techniques. The
emission properties of both Ant-PIm and the fluorescent
amino acid residues in HSA undergo remarkable changes upon complexation
allowing the thermodynamic profile associated with Ant-PIm–HSA complexation to be accurately established. The marked
increase in Ant-PIm fluorescence intensity and quantum
yield in the proteinous environment seems to be the outcome of the
attenuation of radiationless decay pathways resulting from motional
restriction imposed on the fluorophore. Fluorescence resonance energy
transfer and site-marker competitive experiments provide conclusive
evidence that the binding of Ant-PIm preferentially occurs
within the subdomain IIA. The pronounced hypsochromic effect and increased
fluorescence enhancement upon association with HSA, compared to that
of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and other biological interferents, makes
the polymeric Ant-PIm probe a valuable sensing agent
in rather complex biological environments, allowing facile discrimination
between the closely related HSA and BSA. Furthermore, the strong two-photon
absorption (TPA) with a maximum located at 820 nm along with a TPA
cross section σ2 > 800 GM, and the marked changes
in the position and intensity of the band upon complexation definitely
make Ant-PIm a promising probe for two-photon excited
fluorescence-based discrimination of HSA from BSA.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The
archetypical human serum albumin (HSA) is the main extracellular
protein of the circulatory system.1−3 In particular, the ability
of HSA to interact with a wide range of endogenous metabolites and
exogenous drugs, which may modify their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
properties and influence their distribution and availability toward
the biological target, is well known.4−6

X-ray crystallographic
analysis of HSA has revealed that this globular
protein, a 585 amino acid residue monomer, consists of three homologous
α-helical domains (I–III), each of which is subdivided
into two subdomains A and B.7 Competitive
studies and crystal structure analysis enabled the identification
of two specific ligand binding sites within the hydrophobic cavities
of the protein template named either subdomains IIA and IIIA or Sudlow’s
site I and II, respectively, in which molecules acting as HSA probes
bind to this biomolecule with association constants ranging from 103 to 106 M–1.8−10 It is known
that either a low (hypoproteinemia) or high level (microalbuminaria)
of HSA in the blood plasma is a characteristic feature of physical
health issues such as cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis, diabetes, and
hypertension.11,12 In this context, the selectivity
of a probe with respect to binding with HSA or other relevant reactive
biological interferents (bovine serum albumin (BSA), myoglobin, lysozyme,
chymotrypsin, chymotrypsinogen A, l-cysteine, l-glutathione,
and l-arginine) is of great interest for laboratory biomedical
analyses. In this article, we were particularly interested in controlling
the HSA selectivity over BSA. BSA, which demonstrates 70% of the biological
functions of HSA, is widely used as a HSA replacement due to its lower
cost in many biochemical and pharmacological assays;13−16 the ability to discriminate between these two similar proteins is
therefore a challenge of great importance. Although several fluorescent
probes for serum albumin detection have been reported, most of them
have shown poor selectivity for HSA over BSA and their detection limits
were found to be above 30 mg/L.17−28 Additionally, their excitation and emission wavelengths often lie
in the UV or visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum, which
does not allow easy discrimination from biological autofluorescence.
Thus, red emitting probes that can be excited by two-photon absorption
(TPA) in the near infrared (NIR) range would constitute a significant
improvement over existing systems.

Indeed, the development of
new, bright, two-photon fluorescence
probes, possessing a relatively high TPA cross section in the NIR
region, has received much attention during the last decade due to
their promising applications in both laboratory biological imaging
and clinical diagnosis.29−35 Advantages such as larger penetration depth of the exciting light,
low tissue autofluorescence background, reduced photodamage, and photobleaching
make two-photon based technologies an advantageous substitute over
their one-photon counterparts.29−35

We recently developed a polymer engineering strategy for water-soluble
polymer NIR probes with large two-photon excited fluorescence brightness
for cellular and intravital two-photon laser scanning microscopy (TPLSM)
imaging.36−38 From a chemist’s point of view, to meet the
criteria needed for the development of suitable nonlinear probes useful
for in vitro or in vivo cell imaging in tissues, detection of chemical
analytes, and monitoring of biological processes with excellent spatial
and temporal resolution, requires to address several pivotal points,
which were central in our rational molecular engineering approach:38−40i. The molecule
should display a large
TPA cross section and significant fluorescence quantum yield in the
biological transparency window (BTW: 680–1300 nm);

ii. The molecule should possess
good two-photon
brightness (φ × σ2), in the far-red or
NIR regions, to be implemented as a microscopic tool in TPLSM procedures;

iii. The molecule must be
water soluble
(the majority of nonlinear probes are not soluble in water media due
to the extended aromatic surfaces needed to enhance the σ2 values), biocompatible, and furtive to the immune system
to ensure a relatively long residence time within the organism that
is compatible with imaging of biological processes;

iv. The molecule must be nontoxic, affordable
at a large scale, and exert good selectivity toward biological targets/compartments.



An overwhelming majority of the aforementioned
points were addressed
for the neutral macromolecular probes Ant-PHEA(36) and the quasi-quadrupolar Ant2-PHEA,38 which are two of our best-suited reported
probes in this regard.

We recently found that Ant-PHEA and its analogous
cationic (Ant-PIm) anthracene polymeric probe, designed
using this approach, presented relatively high affinity toward double-stranded
DNA, even if the latter seemed to be particularly sensitive to the
surroundings.41,42 This overall framework prompted
us to investigate the affinity of Ant-PIm (Figure 1), whose synthesis has been
reported elsewhere,42 toward HSA and its
selectivity over BSA.

Figure 1 Chemical structure of Ant-PIm (n =
4 and 5).

In this contribution, we report
the characterization of the HSA–Ant-PIm binding
mode using a combination of steady-state,
time-resolved, and two-photon excited fluorescence techniques. In
particular, we provide detailed insights into the affinity constant,
binding sites, intermolecular distance, nonlinear optical parameters,
and secondary structure changes determining the Ant-PIm–HSA association mechanism. Furthermore, the ability of Ant-PIm to selectively recognize and discriminate HSA from
BSA and common biological interferents is also described, highlighting
the outstanding properties of the probe to suitably detect HSA in
rather complex biological environments. This is the first report in
which a water-soluble nonlinear probe, which can be excited by TPA
within the BTW, is used to selectively detect and discriminate serum
proteins in rather complex biological environments under simulated
physiological conditions.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Effect of Ant-PIm on HSA Fluorescence Spectra
HSA contains
a single tryptophan, Trp-214, and 18 tyrosine (Tyr)
residues, which are responsible for its intrinsic fluorescence.43 Trp-214 is located in subdomain IIA within a
hydrophobic pocket, whereas the Tyrs are distributed along the whole
peptide chain.44 Upon excitation at 280
nm, both the tryptophan and Tyr residues are readily excited but most
of the fluorescence arises from Trp-214 due to the resonance energy
transfer from Tyr to tryptophan.43 However,
the excitation wavelength of 293 nm allows only the tryptophan residue
to emit fluorescence.43 If Ant-PIm interacts with HSA, the fluorescence properties of HSA may be modified
depending on the proximity of the ligand to the intrinsic protein
fluorophores (Trp and/or Tyr). To determine whether both the tryptophan
and Tyr residues are involved in the Ant-PIm–HSA
association process the protein fluorescence emission spectra were
recorded in the absence and in the presence of the anthracenyl derivative
using excitation wavelengths of 280 and 293 nm (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Fluorescence emission spectra of HSA (10.0 μM)
treated with:
0.0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0, 12.5, and 15.0 μM (curves 1–7) Ant-PIm at 298 K at (A) λexc = 280 nm and
(B) λexc = 293 nm.

Upon addition of increasing concentrations of Ant-PIm, a steady decrease in the HSA fluorescence intensity (≈91%
at λexc = 280 nm and ≈86% at λexc = 293 nm), with a concomitant red shift (λmax (λexc=280 nm) = 340 nm and λmax (λexc=293 nm) = 346 nm) of the maximum emission wavelength
of 8 and 4 nm, respectively, was observed, suggesting that almost
quantitative energy transfer from the aa residues to Ant-PIm occurs. To provide further insights into the quenching nature of
the HSA–Ant-PIm complex, the fluorescence data
were analyzed using the Stern–Volmer equation assuming a static
binding quenching phenomenon, as discussed in detail further on.45,46 1  where F0 and F denote the steady-state fluorescence intensities in the
absence and presence of Ant-PIm, respectively. KS is the Stern–Volmer constant used in
the presence of a static quenching mechanism, [Q] is the Ant-PIm concentration, kq is the apparent quenching
rate constant of the biomolecules, and τ0 is the
average excited-state lifetime of HSA without a quencher and it is
equal to 3.53 × 10–9 s.47,48

Due to Ant-PIm absorption at the excitation and
emission
wavelengths, an inner filter correction was applied before quantitatively
analyzing the data using the following equation.49 2  where Fcorr and Fobs are the corrected and observed fluorescence,
respectively, and Aex and Aem are the absorbance values at the excitation and emission
wavelengths, respectively.

The plot of F0/F versus
[Ant-PIm] is shown in Figure 3A.

Figure 3 (A) Stern–Volmer plots for the quenching
of HSA fluorescence
by Ant-PIm at 298 K (λexc = 280 nm and
293 K). (B) Stern–Volmer plot for the quenching of HSA fluorescence
by Ant-PIm at 298, 304, and 310 K (λexc = 280 nm).

A significant difference
in magnitude of the KS values (KS (λexc=280nm) = (6.8
± 0.2) × 104 M–1 and KS (λexc=293nm) = (4.8 ±
0.3) × 104 M–1) after excitation
at these two wavelengths was observed indicating the involvement,
to some extent, of the Tyr residues in the molecular interaction between
HSA and Ant-PIm, and this is further confirmed by the
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) studies discussed further on.

It is known that quenching of the fluorescence intensity can be
ascribed to a wide variety of molecular interactions including ground-state
complex formation, collisional quenching, excited-state reactions,
molecular rearrangement, and energy transfer.45 Such different mechanisms are usually collectively considered as
either static or dynamic quenching. Static quenching arises from the
formation of a ground-state dark complex between the fluorophore (F)
and the quencher (Q), whereas dynamic quenching refers to the diffusive
encounter between the fluorophore and the quencher during the lifetime
of the excited state.

Static and dynamic quenching can be distinguished
by their different
dependence on temperature.45 Higher temperatures
lead to faster diffusion and thus larger amounts of collisional quenching,
whereas in the case of static quenching, they will typically result
in the dissociation of weakly bound complexes. The KS temperature-dependence analysis (Figure 3B and Table 1) shows that less quenching occurs at higher temperatures
strongly pointing toward formation of the Ant-PIm–HSA complex through a static mechanism. Further evidence was also
provided by analysis of the kq values,
which were found to be much higher than the maximum diffusion collisional
quenching rate of various quenchers with biopolymers ≈ 2.0
× 1010 M–1 s–1, confirming the ground-state complex formation (Table 1).

2.2 Fluorescence Binding Data
Analysis
By exploiting the fluorescence titration data and
assuming a static
quenching event, we evaluated the association constant (Ka) using the modified Stern–Volmer equation45 3  where ΔF is the difference
between the total fluorescence in the absence and in the presence
of Ant-PIm and fa is the
fraction of fluorescence that is accessible to the quencher and is
equivalent to the number of binding sites (n).

The plot of F0/ΔF versus the inverse of the quencher concentration [Q] is linear,
which suggests a single component donor quenching system that would
be expected for one major binding mode (Figure 4A). The obtained data listed in Table 1 clearly evidence
the accessibility of the fluorophore to the quencher and a moderate
binding affinity.

plots of the Ant-PIm–HSA association system at
298, 304, and 310 K.

When a guest molecule binds to a set of equivalent sites
on a macromolecule,
the equilibrium binding constant (Kb)
can be further calculated according to the Scatchard equation50−52 4  where r is the number of
ligands attached to a single protein, Df is the molar concentration of the free ligand, and n refers to the binding site multiplicity per class of binding sites.

As reported in Table 1, the magnitudes of the binding constants (Kb) are in good agreement with those found using the modified
Stern–Volmer plots (Ka) and agree
well with literature data on a variety of therapeutic compounds targeting
the protein template.50,53−55 Furthermore,
the linearity of the Scatchard plots (Figure 4B) corroborates well with the aforementioned
hypothesis that only one class of binding sites is available to the
quencher and it also highlights the noncooperativity of the process.

2.3 Analysis of Protein Secondary Structure
Changes in the protein secondary structure upon ligand interaction
were studied by exploiting the circular dichroism (CD) technique.
The HSA CD spectrum consists of one negative dichroic band located
in the far UV spectral region, which is characteristic of the α-helical
structure of the protein.56Ant-PIm, which is achiral, is thus CD inactive.42 Upon addition of Ant-PIm to the HSA solution, a steady
decrease in the negative ellipticities at 208 and 222 nm was observed
indicating a decrease in the intrinsic HSA α-helix content (Figure 5).

Figure 5 CD spectra of HSA (1.0
μM) treated with: 0.0 (black line),
1.25 (red line), 2.5 (blue line), and 5.0 (green line) μM Ant-PIm at 298 K.

To provide quantitative information on the HSA secondary
structure,
we calculated the mean residue ellipticity (MRE) value at 208 nm and
the α-helix % content using the following equations56 5   6  where Θ208 is the observed
CD value (in millidegrees), Cp is the
concentration of the protein, l is the path length
of the cuvette, and n is the number of amino acid
residues of the protein (585); 4000 is the MRE of the β-sheet
and random coil conformation at 208 nm and 33 000 is the MRE
of a pure α-helix at 208 nm.

According to the above equations,
the percentages of α-helix
at different HSA/Ant-PIm molar ratios were calculated.
It was found that the HSA α-helix content decreases from 56.8
to 46.2, 33.8, and 24.1% with increasing Ant-PIm concentration
(r = 0.8, 0.4, and 0.2, respectively). The CD data
categorically established that the presence of the ligand perturbs
the protein secondary structure, even if the lack of shift in CDmax and the similarity of the intrinsic dichroic protein bands
in the absence and in the presence of the ligand suggest that HSA
retained its original conformation excluding a denaturation process.
To further support our hypothesis, infrared spectroscopic studies
were carried out for the free and complexed protein (Figure 6).

Figure 6 FT-IR spectra of the
free HSA and Ant-PIm and their
relative difference FT-IR spectra at a Ant-PIm/HSA molar
ratio equal to 1.

As one can easily see,
no major spectral shift for the protein
amide I band at 1654 cm–1 (mainly C=O stretch)
and amide II band at 1539 cm–1 (N–H bending
coupled with C–N stretching mode) could be observed upon ligand
interaction. Nevertheless, a decrease in intensity of both the amide
bands was detected suggesting a weak overall perturbation of the protein
secondary structure due to the reduction in α-helix content,
which correlates well with the CD results discussed above.55,57−59 It is worth noting that the weak band at 1454 cm–1 of the free HSA, assigned to the Tyr side chain vibration,
shifted to 1448 cm–1 upon ligand addition, which
confirms the involvement to some extent of the Tyr residues in the
molecular interaction between HSA and Ant-PIm.60,61 Further insights into the Ant-PIm–HSA adduct
were also provided by analyzing the intrinsic vibrational bands of
the anthracenyl derivative. Upon complexation, the bands of the free
fluorophore at 1729 and 1167 cm–1 (assigned to C=O
and C–O stretching, respectively) shifted to 1734 and 1170
cm–1, respectively, presumably due to the occurrence
of external binding interactions, electrostatic in nature, between
the hydrogen bond donor (Tyr 411 and Ser 489) and acceptor sites of
the protein and ligand, respectively. Moreover, the free Ant-PIm bands at 1602, 1390, and 767 cm–1 ascribed to
the C–C stretching and C–H bending of the aromatic rings
shifted to 1621, 1386, and 760 cm–1, respectively,
highlighting the presence of hydrophobic contacts through the anthracenyl
polymer aliphatic chain and the surrounding hydrophobic environment
in which the tryptophan residue is located, which is in good agreement
with the thermodynamic studies reported within the Supporting Information.

2.4 Intermolecular
Energy Transfer
The
steady-state emission data obtained (vide supra) upon excitation of
Trp-214 (λexc = 280 nm) suggest the existence of
energy transfer from Trp-214 to Ant-PIm. Figure 7 shows the overlap between
the HSA emission and Ant-PIm absorption spectra, respectively.

Figure 7 Spectral
overlap between the HSA emission and Ant-PIm absorption
spectra. [HSA]/[Ant-PIm] = 1.

The Förster equation for nonradiative energy transfer
(FRET)
can be used to probe the proximity and relative angular orientation
between the excited molecule (donor) and its neighbor (acceptor).62−64 It is well established that FRET occurs only when all of the following
three requirements are fulfilled: (i) the donor (D) is a fluorescence
emitter; (ii) the fluorescence emission spectrum of the donor and
the absorption spectrum of the acceptor (A) at least partially overlap;
and (iii) the distance between D and A is lower than 10 nm.40 Under such circumstances, the distance r between HSA (Trp-214) and Ant-PIm can be
calculated using the following equation45 7  where E and r denote
the efficiency of transfer and the average distance between
D and A, respectively; R0 is the critical
distance when the energy transfer is 50% and is expressed by the following
equation.45 8  where K2 is the
orientation factor related to the geometry of the donor and acceptor
dipoles in random orientation and its value is equal to 2/3 (which
is the approximate case considered here, as we cannot get more precise
information); n is the average refractive index of
the media; Φ is the fluorescence quantum yield of the donor;
and J is the overlap integral between the emission
spectrum of the donor and the absorption spectrum of the acceptor
and it is defined by the equation given below.45 9  where F(λ) is the corrected
fluorescence intensity of the donor in the wavelength range from λ
to λ + Δλ and ε(λ) is the extinction
coefficient of the acceptor at each λ.

By applying eqs 7–9 and knowing that n = 1.36 and Φ
= 0.118,45,65 we calculated the following parameters: J = 2.70 × 10–14 cm3 M–1; E = 0.33; R0 = 2.89 nm; r = 3.25 nm. As the average distance
between donor and acceptor is within the 2–10 nm range and
0.5R0 < r < 1.5R0, these results indicate that the energy transfer
from HSA to Ant-PIm occurs with high probability and
provides further evidence for Ant-PIm–HSA complexation
through a static quenching mechanism.6 The
average distance r was found to be in good agreement
with those reported for a variety of compounds targeting Sudlow’s
sites.6,50,54,64

According to the Förster theory, the
rate constant of energy
transfer (kET) from Trp-214 to Ant-PIm can be estimated by the following equation.45 10  where
τHSA = 3.53 ×
10–9 s.47,48 By implementing the
parameters calculated above (eqs 7–9) into the equation, we obtain kET = 1.40 × 108 s–1, which indicates that the energy transfer rate between Trp-214 and Ant-PIm is fast enough to compete with the radiative deactivation
of the tryptophan residue.47,48

2.5 Effect
of HSA on Ant-PIm Fluorescence Spectra
Ant-PIm is a strong luminophore and shows an emission
band centered at 570 nm when excited with 516 nm wavelength radiation
(Figure 8). Changes
in the emission spectra of Ant-PIm upon incremental addition
of HSA were thus investigated.

Figure 8 Fluorescence emission spectra of Ant-PIm (2.5 μM)
at 298 K treated with: 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, and 50
μM (curves 1–11) HSA. Inset: plot of 1/(I –
I0) against 1/[HSA] for the Ant-PIm–HSA system at 298 K (λexc = 516 nm).

Upon incrementally increasing concentrations of
HSA, an enhancement
in the fluorescence intensity of Ant-PIm along with a
14 nm blueshift of the maximum emission wavelength was detected. The
enhancement in the fluorescence intensity and change in maximal wavelength
can both be ascribed to either (i) the reduction in polarity of the
environment around Ant-PIm that arises from its interaction
with the hydrophobic pocket of the protein or (ii) the accommodation
of the Ant’s chromophore into the HSA template;
this may simultaneously impose a specific conformation on its long
conjugated carbon skeleton, causing modification in the ground and
excited-state geometries of the chromophore, and reducing the freedom
of rotation of the fluorophore, which in turn, limits the possibility
of vibrational deactivation pathways.

To provide quantitative
information on the strength of the HSA–Ant-PIm interaction, the modified Benesi–Hildebrand
equation was used66 11  where I0 and I are the emission intensities of Ant-PIm in
the absence and presence of the protein, respectively, and I∞ is the fluorescence intensity at saturated
interaction, which is reached when the excess of added protein in
the medium is so large that Ant-PIm is exclusively present
in its bound form. The plot of 1/(I – I0) versus 1/CHSA is linear over
the whole concentration range studied and the binding constant (Kf) can be calculated from the ratio of the intercept
and the slope (inset Figure 8) providing a value equal to (8.5 ± 0.1) × 104 M–1, which confirms a relatively high binding
affinity.

Moreover, by exploiting the linear dependence of the Ant-PIm emission changes as a function of HSA concentration,
we determined
a limit of detection (LOD) (=3σ/slope) = 7.5 × 10–3 mg/mL, which makes Ant-PIm an ideal probe to estimate
HSA in normal and albuminuria urine samples.26

2.6 Time-Resolved Fluorescence Decay Measurements
To elucidate the origin of the Ant-PIm fluorescence
enhancement in complex with HSA, the changes in the fluorescence decay
functions upon binding to the protein were determined, and are shown
in Figure 9.

Figure 9 Representative
time-resolved fluorescence decay profiles (λexc =
515 nm) of Ant-PIm at different HSA/Ant-PIm molar ratios. [Ant-PIm] = 2.5 μM.

The free Ant-PIm was found to exhibit
a mono-exponential
decay pattern that comprised a slow component of 3.27 ns. However,
as reported in Table 2, the time-resolved fluorescence decay of Ant-PIm bound
to HSA could be satisfactorily described by a bi-exponential pattern
with two distinct lifetimes.

Fluorescence Quantum Yield, and Kinetic Parameters of Ant-PIm with Increasing Concentrations of HSA

15	48	52	2.70	4.77	4.06	0.53	13.05	11.58	
Upon addition of HSA, the component τ1, which
corresponds to the free Ant-PIm molecule, shows a sudden
decrease in magnitude followed by the simultaneous appearance of a
new component τ2, which provides the largest contribution.
The direct outcome of the binding phenomenon between the Ant’s chromophore and the protein template can be confirmed by
the progressive increase in the average lifetime ⟨τ⟩
with increasing protein concentration.

A more quantitative data
analysis was undertaken to demarcate the
contribution of the radiative (kr) and
nonradiative (knr) decay constants of Ant-PIm in an aqueous buffer solution and protein environment
according to the following equations45 12   13  where Φf denotes the fluorescence
quantum yield of Ant-PIm. On the basis of the calculated
results shown in Table 2, we infer that the longest chromophore lifetime is the direct outcome
of the attenuation of the radiationless pathway via the motional restriction
imposed on the Ant-PIm moiety.

2.7 Unraveling
the Selective Ant-PIm Binding to
Biological Targets
These results prompted us to to investigate
whether the revealed emission enhancement upon HSA interaction could
be taken advantage of in the conception of a biocompatible fluorescent
probe that is able to discriminate HSA from BSA. As shown in Figure 10, an enhancement
in the intrinsic Ant-PIm fluorescence intensity with
a concomitant 4 nm blueshift of λmax was observed
upon BSA addition. Consequently, the reduced hyperchromic and hypsochromic
effect observed for the Ant-PIm–BSA complex (Kf Ant-PIM-BSA = (3.0 ± 0.3) × 104 M–1)
as compared to that of the Ant-PIm–HSA adduct
allows easy discrimination of HSA from BSA, either by the monitoring
of their emission spectra or by naked-eye detection, as shown in Figure 11.

and presence of serum proteins.

Further insights were also provided by testing the Ant-PIm-sensing response toward common biological interferents
by fluorescence
spectroscopy experiments. As shown in Figure 12, no, or very weak, changes to λmax occurred in the intrinsic Ant-PIm emission
upon binding to common biomolecules, which highlights the probe’s
excellent ability to suitably detect HSA in rather complex biological
environments.

2.8 Two-Photon Fluorescence Response of the Free
Ant-PIm and Ant-PIm–Protein Systems
Recent developments
in TPA applications have focused on identifying extrinsic biological
targeting agents that are easily excitable by a short pulse light
source because they can avoid conventional one-photon drawbacks such
as shallow penetration depth, a relatively high autofluorescence background
from other naturally occurring emissive compounds, and the tissue
photodamage inherent to conventional UV–visible (UV–vis)
sources.29−35 Consequently, NIR TPA excitable probes, with a high TPA cross section
(σ2), are a much sought-after class of dyes for biomedical
imaging, analysis, and diagnosis.29−35

As shown in Figure 13 (top left panel), a relatively high TPA is observed in the
spectral region between 780 and 860 nm with the maximum located at
820 nm for both the free and complexed Ant-PIm. It is
worth noting that the cross section values vary significantly between
the unbound (σ2Ant-PIm = 813
GM at 820 nm) and bound dye (σ2Ant-PIm–HSA = 469 GM and σ2Ant-PIm–BSA = 443 GM at 820 nm); therefore, the lack of a common
scaling factor for the free and bound Ant-PIm molecule
states makes the straightforward comparison of σ2 values very difficult, as the environmental conditions in which
the fluorophore is placed can dramatically modify the transition dipole
moment of the dye, affecting the two-photon cross section magnitude.
However, if we compare the Ant-PIm performance in terms
of molecular brightness (σ2 × Φf), we find two similar values for the free fluorophore (σ2(Ant-PIm) × Φf(Ant-PIm) = 244 GM at 820 nm) and its HSA-bound state (σ2(Ant-PIm–HSA) × Φf(Ant-PIm–HSA) = 248 GM at 820 nm)
(Figure 13 top right
panel). These overall findings definitively make the anthracenyl derivative
a promising sensing probe for serum protein detection. This was illustrated
by irradiating the same cuvettes, as shown in Figure 11, with a Ti-Sapphire laser working at 820
nm: a detectable two-photon excited fluorescence was observed for
all three mixtures, underlining even further the potential of Ant-PIm for use as a selective probe for the discrimination
of HSA versus BSA even in complicated, auto-fluorescent biological
mixtures (Figure 13 bottom central panel).

3 Conclusions
In summary,
the HSA-binding properties of a water-soluble fluorophore
have been comprehensively investigated under simulated physiological
conditions. Steady-state fluorescence data, obtained as a function
of temperature, confirmed that hydrophobic forces regulate the Ant-PIm–HSA complex formation. Displacement and energy
transfer studies provide clear evidence for the binding of Ant-PIm in the protein subdomain IIA. CD and FT-IR structural analysis showed
a decrease in the protein α-helix content upon ligand complexation
even if no, or weak, overall changes in the HSA secondary structure
were observed. Enhancement of the intrinsic Ant-PIm fluorescence
intensity and changes in the fluorophore’s lifetime may be
considered to be the direct outcome of the attenuation of the radiationless
pathway via the motional restriction imposed on the Ant’s moiety from the protein template. The different Ant-PIm emission response to HSA and BSA categorically established the excellent
selectivity of the probe to suitably target the two similar proteins
even in rather complex biosystems, as proven by the lack of response
toward common biological interferents. Moreover, the high TPA cross
section (σ2 > 800 GM) maximum located at 820 nm
makes
the anthracenyl derivative a promising probe for serum protein discrimination.
This is the first report in which a water-soluble two-photon fluorophore
has been used for selective albumin detection at physiological pH.
We speculate that future works in this area will open up new avenues
to develop smart multi-photon anthracenyl-based sensors, which have
the potential to emerge as specific bio-markers for diagnostic applications.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Synthesis of Ant-PIm
The synthetic
route and the physical properties of the anthracenyl derivative Ant-PIm are reported in our previous papers.42

4.2 Reagents
All chemicals
used throughout
the experiments were purchased from commercial suppliers and used
without further purification. HSA and BSA, purchased from Sigma-Aldrich,
were diluted in Milli-Q water to a final concentration of 0.2 mM.
Stock solutions of Myoglobin, l-glutathione, l-arginine,
lysozyme, l-cysteine, chymotrypsin, and chymotrypsinogen
A were prepared by dissolving the samples in Milli-Q water until the
desired concentration was reached. Sodium cacodylate trihydrate (0.05
M), supplied by Sigma-Aldrich, was used to control the pH of the solutions
(pH 7.2).

4.3 Apparatus and Methods
Absorption
spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer Lambda 20 UV–vis spectrometer.
Emission spectra were obtained with a Hitachi F-4500 spectrofluorometer
equipped with a xenon lamp. Fluorescence lifetimes were determined
with an Edinburgh Instruments FLS 980 spectrophotometer via time-correlated
single-photon counting (TCSPC), with excitation from a 516 nm picosecond
laser diode. Two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) was achieved with
a coherent chameleon laser that delivered a train of ≈100 fs
pulses with 80 MHz repetition rate. The TPEF spectra were recorded
by an Ocean Optics 2000 fiber spectrometer. CD experiments were conducted
on a Jasco J-815 spectropolarimeter (Jasco Inc). The infrared spectra
were collected on a diamond crystal surface under vacuum (<1 hPa)
using a Bruker Vertex70v FT-IR spectrometer. Quartz cells with a 1
cm path length were used throughout the measurements.

Titration
experiments were recorded keeping the final volume of each solution
constant to reduce dilution issues and thus achieve better reproducibility
of the recorded data.

4.4 Steady-State Fluorescent
Measurements
Fluorescence quenching studies were recorded
at different temperatures
(298, 304, and 310 K) keeping the HSA concentration constant (10 μM;
λexc = 280 nm or λexc = 293 nm)
and varying that of the anthracenyl derivative Ant-PIm until saturation was achieved.

The intrinsic Ant-PIm emission response toward biomolecules was observed at a fixed Ant-PIm concentration (2.5 μM; λexc = 516 nm) and varying that of the biological targets.

The
resulting changes in the emission profiles were used to calculate
the biophysical and thermodynamic parameters as well as the strength
of binding.

Moreover, the linear dependence of the fluorescence
emission of Ant-PIm in the presence of increasing concentrations
of HSA
allowed the LOD to be estimated, which was defined as: LOD = 3σ/k,
where σ is the standard deviation of the blank measurement and k is the slope of the linear plot obtained by casting the
changes in the fluorescence intensity of the Ant-PIm–HSA complex as a function of HSA concentration.26,67,68

4.5 Fluorescent Displacement
Assay
Site-marker
competition experiments were performed using the well known serum
protein binders Ibuprofen and Warfarin purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
An equimolar concentration of both drugs and HSA was mixed and the
relative product was scanned in the wavelength range 285–500
nm (λexc = 280). The resulting signal was normalized
to 100% of the emission profile. Subsequently, various concentrations
of Ant-PIm were added to the mixture and the fluorescence
was measured after an incubation time of 10 min. The addition of Ant-PIm was continued until the fluorescence signal reached
saturation. The study, which allowed us to conclude that Ant-PIm could efficiently replace both binders, is included as Supplementary Material.

4.6 Time-Resolved
Fluorescence
Fluorescence
decay traces of both the free Ant-PIm and its bound sate
were recorded via TCSPC. The fluorescence was collected at a 90°
geometry after passing through a polarizer set at the magic angle.
Calculations of Ant-PIm excited-state lifetimes (τi) and the corresponding amplitude (Ai) were made using OriginPro 8 software. The amplitude-weighted
fluorescence lifetime was calculated using the following formula 14  where n denotes
the number
of decay components in the total function.

4.7 TPEF
TPEF measurements were performed
at HSA or BSA/Ant-PIm molar ratios r = 0 and 6 using fluorescein as the reference. The relative concentration
was adjusted so that the linear absorbance at 2hν
was kept below 0.1 over the whole wavelength range studied (780–920
nm).

The TPA cross section was determined according to the following
equation 15  where σ2 is the TPA cross
section, c and n are the concentration
and refractive index, respectively, and F is the
integrated area obtained from the TPEF spectrum. The subscript r refers
to the reference solution.

4.8 CD Spectroscopy
CD spectra were recorded
as an average of five scans within the wavelength range 200–500
nm. The Ant-PIm/HSA molar ratios were varied from 0 to
5 and the buffer contribution subtracted from each recorded spectrum.
Quantitative analysis of the protein secondary structure was performed
according to previous reports.69

4.9 FT-IR Spectroscopic Measurements
IR measurements were
carried out at a fixed HSA/Ant-PIm ratio (r = 1) and the relative signal of either
the free HSA or Ant-PIm was subtracted from the HSA–Ant-PIm complex spectrum to achieve only the contribution
of the interaction.
