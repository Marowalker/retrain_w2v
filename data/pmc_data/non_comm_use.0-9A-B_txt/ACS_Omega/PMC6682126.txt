DNA methylation (DNAm)
sensors are an emerging branch in the discipline of sensors. It is
believed to be able to promote the next generation of epigenetics-based
diagnostic technology. Differing from the traditional biochemical
sensors that aimed at individual molecules, the challenge in DNAm
sensors is how to determine the amount of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) in
a continuous nucleotide sequence. Here, we report a comparative study
about meso-tetra(4-carboxyphenyl)porphine (TCPP)-based DNAm sensing
interfaces on a light-addressable potentiometric sensor (LAPS), depending
on TCPP’s postures that are flat in the π-conjugated
TCPP layer on reduced-graphene-oxide-decorated LAPS (#1) and stand-up
in the covalently anchored TCPP on glutaraldehyde (GA)-treated LAPS
(#2), along with the blank one (only GA-treated LAPS, #3). These DNAm
sensing interfaces are also distinct from the traditional biosensing
interface on LAPS, that is: it is not functionalized by the sensing
indicator (5mC antibody, in this case) but by the target nucleotide
sequence. The surface characterization techniques such as Raman spectra,
scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
are conducted to prove the decorations, as well as the anchored nucleotides.
It is found that, though all of them can detect as low as one 5mC
in the target sequence, the enhanced DNAm sensitivity is obtained
by #2, which is evidenced by the higher output-voltage changing ratio
for the 5mC site of #2 than those of #1 and #3. Furthermore, the underlying
causes for the improved sensitivity in #2 are proposed, according
to the conformational and electronic properties of TCPP molecules.
Conclusively, TCPP’s synergetic function, including the molecular
configuration and the activate (carboxyl) groups on its peripheral
substituents, to improve the DNAm sensing interface on LAPS is investigated
and demonstrated. This can shed light on a new approach for DNA methylation
detection, with the merits of low cost, independence on bisulfite
conversion, and polymerase chain reaction.

==== Body
1 Introduction
DNA methylation (DNAm) refers to the presence
of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) on the gene sequence.1 As one of the epigenetic mechanisms, it is essential for
embryonic development,2 genomic imprinting,3 X-chromosome inactivation,4 etc. It has been accepted that understanding the DNAm degree
in a certain genomic DNA sequence is conducive to the early diagnosis
and treatment of disease.5 Therefore, an
effective technology to profile the landscape of genomic methylation
is necessary. Lots of conventional approaches have been extensively
developed for the determination of DNAm, such as methylation-specific
polymerase chain reaction (PCR),6 bisulfite
conversion (BC),7 fluorescence assay,8 high-performance liquid chromatography,9 and mass spectroscopy.10 Recently, attention has been focused on electrochemistry (EC)-based
DNAm detections,11 in which the key problem
is how to recognize the 5mC and transduce it to the electronic signal.
The basic EC-based 5mC sensing strategies can be grouped in four categories:
(1) the direct detection based on the electro-oxidation peak of 5mC;12 (2) the methylated and demethylated DNA after
having undergone endonuclease digestion can be discriminated by the
differential pulse voltammogram (DPV) technique;13 (3) after suffering BC and PCR, the methylated and unmethylated
genomic sequences are in the states of guanine-enrich and adenine-enrich,
respectively, which can be measured by EC signals;14,15 (4)
the anti-5mC monoclonal antibody (anti-5mC)-based DNAm sensing mechanism
(as illustrated in Scheme 1A), which can be measured by the stripping peak induced by
the anti-5mC-functionalized silver nanoparticles modified on glass
carbon electrodes.16 In brief, it has been
confirmed that EC-based DNAm sensors have a promising future to promote
the DNAm assay in clinical medicine.

Scheme 1 Protocol of the DNAm Sensing Interface.
(A) the anti-5mC-based
methylation recognition
strategy; (B) main procedures in forming three DNAm-LAPS, including
the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and TCPP-modified (#1), TCPP-activated
(#2), and blank (#3) LAPSs.

Light-addressable potentiometric
sensors (LAPSs) are a class of surface-charge sensing devices with
the structure of electrolyte–insulator–semiconductor
(EIS). By constructing a specific biochemical sensing interface, it
can be exploited to realize the detection of DNA17,18 and
bacteria.19 In this work, a LAPS is developed
to be a DNAm sensor (named DNAm-LAPS), for the first time, to our
best knowledge. That is, the anti-5mC-based DNAm sensing strategy
(illustrated in Scheme 1A) is brought about on the LAPS’ insulator layer (Si3N4 in this work, as sketched in the right-upper of Scheme 1B), then LAPS’
surface charges can be altered by this DNAm sensing reaction, resulting
in a varied output-voltage (ΔVout) according to LAPS’s working principle, which has been discussed
in our previous work and outlined in Figure S1. In this work, the main attention is how to determine the amount
of 5mC in the target single-strand DNA (ssDNA), which needs to be
fixed on LAPS first, instead of anti-5mC, because anti-5mCs can bind
with any 5mC sites no matter they are in one strand, or not. Then,
if LAPS is functionalized by anti-5mCs, we cannot be sure. If ΔVout is induced by 5mCs from the same strand,
then the goal to measure the amount of 5mCs on the concerned ssDNA
cannot be realized. Accordingly, how to anchor ssDNAs as much as possible
and make them in a suitable posture are of great concern to form an
efficient DNAm-LAPS.

In this context, the captivating ideas
for constructing DNA–porphyrin adducts are ideal for us to
draw upon, which include: (a) intercalating porphyrins into the strand
structure to provide insights into the complicated dynamics;20 (b) attaching porphyrins onto the major/minor
groove to induce DNA cleavage, forming the G-quadruplex DNA21,22 and they act as indicators for DNA detection;23 (c) stacking them onto the DNA strand by π–π*
conjugation21,24 or electrostatic interaction;25 and (d) the covalent binding mode.26,27According to the current understanding of DNA–porphyrin interactions,28 the covalent approach is utilized to anchor
the target nucleotide sequence, for the purpose of exposing the 5mC
sites as much as possible. Meanwhile, metalloporphyrins and dsDNA
are not used as the prototype in this work because they have a strong
tendency to form the π-stacking interaction with DNA.

Herein, two kinds of mesotetrakis(4-carboxylphenyl)porphyrin (TCPP)-decorated
LAPS interfaces are studied as a model for anchoring the tested ssDNA
and the consecutive DNAm detection. In contrast with the blank one,
three kinds of ssDNA-anchored LAPS are illustrated in Scheme 1B and named #1, #2, and #3,
respectively. The reasons for different modification methods are outlined
here. For #1 and #2, TCPP’s morphological features (the shape-persistent
macrocycle, the π-electronic structure, and more carboxyl groups
on its peripheral benzene ring) are utilized to form enhanced DNAm
sensing interfaces on LAPS, because more ssDNA sequences can be fixed
by the covalent bond between TCPP’s carboxyl group and modified
amino group on ssDNA’s 5′ terminal, according to the
report of TCPP-anchored ssDNA on a graphene field-effect-transistor
platform.26 Meanwhile, the extra layer
of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) in #1 is used for the purpose of attaching
more TCPP molecules assisted by the π–π* interaction
between rGO and TCPP. However, whether higher DNAm sensitivity can
be obtained by #1 than #2 is still uncertain because the possible
configurational discrepancies of TCPP between #1 and #2, as diagrammed
in Scheme 1B. Finally,
the blank one (#3) is used as a control.

To identify TCPP molecules,
as well as the immobilized ssDNA on three interfaces (#1, #2, and
#3), surface characterization techniques such as Raman spectra, scanning
electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
are performed first. Then, electronic examinations of DNAm-LAPS are
conducted step by step, to evaluate the TCPP-enhanced DNAm sensing
interface on LAPS. Furthermore, the capability of TCPP to enhance
DNAm sensitivity is evaluated by the relation of LAPS’ changing
ratios of Vout (ΔVout/Vout,0) to the amount
of 5mC sites on the target sequences by comparison of three DNAm sensing
interfaces. Finally, the theoretical deductions are provided for the
measured results, based on the amount of anchored ssDNAs which are
evidenced by XPS characterization, as well as ssDNA morphological
variations on each of the interfaces. It is believed that the improved
DNAm sensing interface on LAPS by vertically anchored TCPP molecules
is an effective and promising candidate for determining the methylation
degree of the anchored sequences, with the merits of independence
on the extra processes like bisulfite conversion and PCR.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Raman and SEM
In Figure 1A, by using TCPP
(green) as a control, the TCPP molecule in TCPP@rGO (red) can be identified
by its characteristic peaks, which are contributed by the vibrations
of Cα–Cm (1004 and 1552 cm–1), Cα–N (1242 cm–1), Cα–Cβ + Cβ–H (1330 and 1457 cm–1), and the weak peak
at 1497 cm–1.29 The positions
of carbon α, β, and m are marked in the inset of Figure 1A. The superimposed
peaks of rGO and TCPP can be distinguished in TCPP@rGO (red) by using
rGO (gray) as a control, which are the D band (∼1346 cm–1), G band (∼1598 cm–1), and
two-dimensional (2D) band (∼2672 cm–1). The
confirmation about a reduced GO layer is made by the existence of
a 2D peak; meanwhile, its full width at half-maximum (about 140 cm–1) indicates that the sp2 carbon network
is distorted. What’s more, the intensity ratio of the D peak
to G peak (ID/IG) is about 1.28, which means that there are still structural defects
in the rGO layer. By comparing “TCPP@rGO” and “rGO”,
the diminished 2D band is deduced to be caused by the π-conjugated
TCPP flakes.

Figure 1 Raman spectra of TCPP,
rGO, and TCPP on rGO (TCPP@rGO), excited at λ = 532 nm (A),
and SEM photographs of TCPP (B), TCPP on rGO (C), and rGO (D).

The SEM image in Figure 1B indicates that the directly coated TCPP
flakes on GA-treated LAPS are not flat, which is similar to the reported
morphology of porphyrin films.30 The cross-stand
TCPP flakes agree with the binding pattern of TCPP as illustrated
in Scheme 1B#2. In
contrast, the TCPP flakes on rGO (Figure 1C) can be identified by the flat strips on
rGO’s nanosheets, which can be identified from the pure rGO
SEM image (Figure 1D). This overlapped TCPP and rGO shape corresponds to the π–π*
conjugation, as mentioned above and illustrated in Scheme 1B#1.

2.2 XPS Characterization
It is found
from the wide spectra (Figure 2A) that the atoms of C, N, and O existed in all samples, while
P, Na, and Cl are only found in the ssDNA-immobilized ones, also proved
by component analysis (Figure S2). In Figure 2B, the resolved curves
of P 2p core spectra (SP_i, i =
1, 2, 3) can be classified into two groups, which are close to 134.0
± 0.1 and 133.0 ± 0.1 eV, and they agree with P atoms in
the phosphate backbone of unpaired ssDNA.31−33 By comparing the N 1s core spectra (Figure 2C) of TCPP-decorated
ones (#1 and #2) with #3 (blank), the existence of TCPP can be identified
by the peaks at about 397.6 and 399.9 eV, which are contributed by
the N atoms in the porphyrin ring.34 Moreover,
the peak fitting analyses of N 1s and C 1s core spectra (Figures S3 and S4) can provide more proofs of
the porphyrin ring and carboxyl in TCPP.34,35 Finally,
the existence of ssDNA can also be evidenced by the peaks at about
401.5 eV in Figure 2D and their peak fitting analyses in Figure S3.

Figure 2 XPS wide
spectra (A),
P 2p core spectra (B), and N 1s core spectra before (C) and after
ssDNA immobilization (D). Split curves (SP_#i, i = 1, 2, 3) in (B) are decomposed by CasaXPS.

Based on these XPS characterization results, it is inferred
that the amounts of anchored ssDNA on three kinds of interfaces can
be ordered as #2 > #1 > #3. This deduction can be explained
from two points: (1) the carboxyl groups in TCPP-decorated ones (#1
and #2), after being treated by EDC and NHS, can provide more covalent
binding sites for the amino-modified ssDNA sequences.26 (2) the less-anchored ssDNA on #1 than #2 can be illustrated
by the morphological differences of TCPP molecules. Although there
are more free carboxyl groups on #1 (10.59%) than #2 (3.99%) (Figure S4), the flat posture of TCPP on #1 (evidenced
by Raman and SEM characterizations) makes the anchored ssDNA chains
consume more surface area. By contrast, the erected TCPP molecules
on #2 is more helpful to reduce the steric hindrance, so more ssDNA
sequences are anchored on #2 than #1.

2.3 Electronic Measurements
First, the basic
working curve of blank LAPS is examined. The gradually growing Vout with the changing of VREF from left to right (Figure 3A) agrees with LAPS’ theory for the p-type Si
substrate.31 The measured Vout is the out-express of the inner electric field (EI) from SI to the bulk of p-Si, which can be
altered by the interface state at Si and insulator SiO2/Si3N4 (SI), as illustrated in Figure 3A-1,A-2. (1) Exhausted state.
It is induced by positive VREF or charges
on the insulator. In this state, EI can
be easily altered by VREF, resulting in Vout changing; (2) Accumulated state, which is
induced by the negative VREF or charges.
In this state, EI cannot be easily altered
because of the homologous carriers (hole) in the SI region and bulk
of p-Si. The steep curve at around VREF 0.4 V indicates that LAPS’ Vout is sensitive to the altered surface potential. Therefore, in the
following experiments, VREF is controlled
at 0.4 V.

Figure 3 Electronic features of
blank LAPS (A), the effects of decorated TCPP (B) and anchored ssDNA
(C) on LAPS’ output voltages. The error bars are the standard
deviations for the average values (n = 5), in which
the data of Vout,0 in (B) and (C) are
the measured Vout when C_TCPP and C_DNA
are zero.

From Figure 3B, it is found that changing ratio (ΔVout/Vout,0) is decreased,
after LAPSs (#1 and #2) are incubated with higher concentrations of
TCPP solutions (C_TCPP). Vout,0 is the
data of Vout when C_TCPP is zero. It is
deduced to be caused by the electronegativity of TCPP’s carboxyl
groups,26 which can introduce negative
charges on the LAPS surface, then more holes may be induced at the
SI interface and weaken the exhausted state, which can subsequently
reduce Vout. Meanwhile, the discrepancy
between #1 and #2 is explained from two sides: (1) the oxygen-containing
groups and the resistance of in rGO coating (#1),36 which can increase the negative charges and lower VREF, respectively. (2) morphological differences
of TCPP at two interfaces which are the evenly π–π
conjugated TCPP on rGO (#1) and the vertically fixed TCPP on GA-treated
LAPS (#2). Then, there will be more free electronegative carboxyl
groups on #1 than on #2, as evidenced by C 1s core spectra analyses
(Figure S4), so Vout of #1 is reduced more than that of #2.

2.4 Responding to ssDNA Immobilization
After incubation with different concentrations of ssDNA (C_DNA,
by using DNAm1 as an example), three kinds of LAPS (#1–#3)
are measured in similar working conditions. Their data of Vout and ΔVout/Vout,0 (Vout,0 is Vout when C_DNA is zero.) are presented
in the bilongitudinal coordinates (Figure 3C). Their main trends are falling down with
the increase of C_DNA (0–100 nM), and it is inferred to be
caused by the negative charges on the anchored phosphate backbone,
which can make the SI interface state changed from A-1 to A-2 (Figure 3A). According to
this common feature in three kinds LAPS (#1–#3), 100 nM ssDNA
solutions are used in the subsequent experiments. Meanwhile, two divergences
are also obvious, which are the upshift Vout curves (#1–#2) and the weakly varied ΔVout/Vout,0 curve (#1).

For the first one, it is deduced to be caused by the positive (Na+) charges that are generated by the EDC and NHS treatments
for #1–#2, as illustrated by the inset in Figure 3C and evidenced by the XPS
spectrum of EDC and NHS modified chip in Figure S5; they can turn the EIS interface state to the “exhausted
state” (as shown in Figure 3A-1) and increase Vout data
at zero. Subsequently, accompanied by ssDNA immobilization, these
positively charged groups are replaced by negatively charged ssDNA
sequences, so the decreased Vout can be
measured.

For the latter one, ΔVout/Vout,0 data of #1 (the blue
dash curve) are only varied around −10 to −30%, whereas
for #2–#3, their data are decreased gradually in the range
of 0–100 nM. This coincides with the morphological discrepancy
of ssDNA on them. For #1, there are two ways for fixing ssDNA: (1)
covalently anchored on the peripheral carboxyl groups of the lateral-orientated
TCPP; (2) π-conjugated on TCPP’s macrocycle or residual
rGO. Both of them can make ssDNA lie on LAPS, induce a large amount
of negative charges on the insulator layer, and turn the SI interface
state into the “accumulated state” (Figure 3A-2) quickly, even when C_DNA
is as low as 10 pM. However, for #2–#3, the covalently anchored
nucleotide strands tend to stand on LAPS, owing to the rigid macrocycle
of erected TCPP (#2) and the short length of the tested ssDNA (#3).
In this case, the interface resistor at SI, which can be increased
with increasing C_DNA, is the main issue to lower Vout, according to our previous work.31 As a consequence, the curves of #2–#3 are similar,
and they gradually fall from −5 to −60% and from −25
to −80% (C_DNA = 10 pM to 100 nM).

2.5 Responding of DNAm-LAPS to Anti-5mC
Based on the optimized experimental conditions, three kinds of DNAm-LAPS
(#1–#3) are examined in the reactions with anti-5mC, after
they are functionalized by different DNAmi (i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4) with similar concentrations (100 nM).
When DNAmi (i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4) is
different, the DNAm-LAPS responding to the concentration of anti-5mC
(C_anti-5mC) is shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4 DNAm-LAPS responding
to anti-5mC, which is functionalized by the sensing interface of #1
(A), #2 (B), and #3 (C), in which Vout,0 is the measured Vout when C_anti-5mC
is zero. The error bars are the standard deviations (n = 5).

First, there are negatively increased data
of ΔVout/Vout,0 in the curves of DNAmi (i = 1, 2, 3, and 4; Vout,0 is the measured Vout when C_anti-5mC is zero.). It is in agreement
with the increased anti-5mC molecules captured by 5mC sites, and they
can increase the interface impedance, depress the exhausted state
(Figure 3A-1), and
decrease Vout consequently. In contrast,
almost no C_anti-5mC-related LAPS responding could be found in the
curves of DNAm0-LAPS (black curves in #1–#3). The comparison
indicates the methylation information about the amount of 5mC on the
anchored DNAmi can be transduced to the changed Vout.

Secondly, TCPP-decorated DNAm-LAPS
(#1–#2) show a wider responding range for C_anti-5mC than the
DNAm-LAPS without TCPP (#3) that demonstrates once more, more DNA
sequences are anchored on TCPP-decorated LAPS. Besides, it is also
found in Figure 4,
when C_anti-5mC <1 μg/mL, the data of ΔVout/Vout,0 vs C_anti-5mC cannot
be ordered regularly from i = 0 to 4, although the
trends of these curves are downward. It is surmised to be caused by
the randomly captured anti-5mC molecules. So, it is necessary to provide
an enough methylation indicator (anti-5mC) for DNAm detection, and
its concentration is optimized as 1 μg/mL.

2.6 Methylation Determination
Methylation determination by three kinds of DNAm-LAPS (#1, #2 and
#3) is compared in Figure 5A, after they are incubated with similar anti-5mC solutions
(1 μg/mL). Generally, the data of −ΔVout/Vout,0 grow up when the
amount of 5mC is varied from 0 to 4, which is coincident with the
increased anti-5mC molecules captured by 5mC sites. It is found that
the DNAm changing ratios of TCPP-decorated DNAm-LAPS are higher than
that of the blank one, due to the increased ssDNA by TCPP’s
peripheral carboxyl groups, which is evidenced by the XPS analyses.

Figure 5 Methylation
evaluation by DNAm-LAPS. (A) −ΔVout/Vout,0 vs the amount of 5mC,
in which the DNAm-LAPS is modified by different methods (#1–#3)
and similar concentrations (100 nM) of DNAmi (i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4), are incubated on them. (B) Selectivity
examinations by DNAm-LAPS of #2, in which equal volume mixtures of
DNAmi (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) with DNAm0
are used as the control. The error bars are the standard deviations
(n = 5).

Moreover, it is also found that TCPP directly decorated DNAm-LAPS
(#2, red line) exhibits higher methylation sensitivity than #1 (blue).
Why rGO coating in #1 (blue) cannot further increase DNAm-LAPS sensitivity?
The reasons may be as follows: (1) the amount of the anchored ssDNA
sequences on #1 is lower than that on #2, which has been evidenced
and explained in the section of XPS characterization; (2) the configuration
of ssDNA on #1 is lying, and the attachment of ssDNA on the substrate
may overlap the 5mC sites. Therefore, the directly decorated TCPP
method is demonstrated to be more effective than the methods of no
TCPP (#3) and with an extra rGO layer (#1).

Finally, the selectivity
of TCPP directly decorated LAPS (#2) to the 5mC site is examined,
as presented in Figure 5B. It is found that the responding data (−ΔVout/Vout,0) for the mixture
of DNAmi and DNAm0 are almost halved. The results
are in agreement with the anchored sequences and the amount of 5mC
on each of them, that is: (1) for the analyte of only DNAmi (i = 1, 2, 3, 4), the growing columns
agree with the increased 5mC sites on the anchored sequences; (2)
for the analyte of the mixture “DNAmi + DNAm0”
with a V/V ratio of 1:1, and there are amino groups on all of them,
the chances of the methylated and unmethylated nucleic acids should
be 50–50, then, when the other conditions are same, the captured
anti-5mC molecules should be halved. However, because of the complexity
and randomness in the binding process, the decreased data (−ΔVout/Vout,0) are
not exactly half, as shown in Figure 5B. Nevertheless, the reduced columns’ height
by mixing DNAm0 can also be observed. Moreover, their shifting trend
from left to right is in a similar way to “DNAmi”, that means, the methylated sites on the anchored sequences
can be selectively detected.

3 Conclusions
In this work, for the particular
DNAm sensing application that is aimed to evaluate the amount of 5mC
sites along the concerned nucleotide sequence, an enhanced sensing
interface is proposed and discussed on the versatile sensing platform
LAPS, according to the TCPP’s distinct structural property,
the highly π-conjugated macrocycle, as well as the functional
groups on its external substituents. It is found that by the LAPS
electronic measurements and the XPS evidence, the initial idea of
using TCPP decoration to enlarge the number of the anchored strands
is accomplished; then under the action of the immunoindicator (anti-5mC),
the 5mC sites on them can be recognized and the increased sensitivity
for the amount of methylated sites is achieved by the TCPP-decorated
LAPS (#1–#2). However, the idea of using rGO in #1 fails to
further enhance the amount of the anchored ssDNA and the DNAm sensitivity,
due to the planar oriented molecules of the π-conjugated TCPP
on rGO. In conclusion, the enhanced DNAm sensing interface is achieved
by the erectly coated TCPP, and the succeeded DNAm-LAPS by this method
may be nominated as an efficient device for epigenetic assay.

The surface of LAPS is activated
by three methods as sketched in Scheme 1B. The main steps executed on the LAPS surface are

h), successively; (2) the first part of APTES and GA-treated LAPS
(named #1) is coated by rGO at room temperature, incubated with TCPP
solutions (37 °C, 3 h), and after being treated by EDC (2 mM)
and NHS (5 mM), they are incubated with different DNAmi solutions (37 °C, 4 h); (3) the second part of LAPS (named

4.4 Experimental Procedures
The data Vout of blank LAPS (#3) are first measured in
PBS, at different VREF (−0.8 to
0.8 V) and the controlled illumination modulation frequency (1 kHz).
Second, TCPP-decorated devices (#1–#2) that are incubated with
TCPP solutions are examined in similar PBS, respectively, at the controlled
illumination background and optimized VREF. Third, after the treatments of EDC (2 mM) and NHS (5 mM) on #1–#2, Vout data of three kinds of LAPS that are incubated
with DNAm1 solutions (0–100 nM) are measured at similar conditions
to those in the second step. Fourth, DNAmi-LAPS (i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4) are prepared after incubating three kinds
of LAPS (#1, #2, #3) in the optimized DNAmi solutions,
respectively. After they have reacted with anti-5mC solutions (0–1
μg/mL) and rinsed with PBS, the data of Vout are measured by the same method as in the third step.

4.5 Methylation Detection
DNAmi-LAPS (i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4)
based on three kinds of sensing surfaces (#1, #2, and #3) are prepared
by incubating them with DNAmi solutions (the optimized
concentration). After being incubated with anti-5mC solution with
the optimized concentration and rinsed with PBS, the methylation detections
are conducted on each of them and their Vout data are measured by the same method as in the fourth step in Experimental Procedures. Finally, the selectivity
experiments are executed by mixing unmethylated nucleic acid (DNAm0,
100 nM) into the methylated ones DNAmi (i = 1, 2, 3, and 4) with a similar concentration and V/V ratio of
1:1 and incubating them onto the optimized DNAm-LAPS. The methylation
detections are conducted following the method in the fourth step of Experimental Procedures.

4.6 Apparatus
SEM examinations are executed
by SEM S-3500N (Hitachi, Japan). XPS measurements are conducted by
Axis Ultra DLD (Kratos Analytical Ltd., U.K.). Raman spectra are measured
by RTS-HiR-AM (Titian Electro-Optics Co. LTD). The home-made LAPS
detection system that has been used previously31 is utilized to perform the electronic measurements, in
which the reference voltage (VREF) and
the illumination’s modulation frequency are controlled as optimized
values.
