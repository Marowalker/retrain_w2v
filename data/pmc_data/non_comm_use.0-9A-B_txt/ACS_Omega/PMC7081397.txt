More than 60 million tons of sulfur
are produced as a byproduct
of the petrochemical industry annually. Recently, the inverse vulcanization
process has transformed this excess sulfur into functional polymers
by stabilization with organic cross-linkers. These interesting new
polymers have many potential applications covering diverse areas.
However, there has been very little focus on the potential of these
high-sulfur polymers for their antibacterial properties. These properties
are examined here by exposing two common bacteria species, Escherichia coli (E. Coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), to two structurally different, inverse
vulcanized sulfur polymers: sulfur-co-diisopropenyl
benzene (S-DIB) and sulfur dicyclopentadiene (S-DCPD). We report the
highest bacteria log reduction (>log 4.3) of adhered bacterial
cells
(S. aureus) to an inverse vulcanized
sulfur polymer to date and investigate the potential pathways in which
antibacterial activity may occur.

Introduction
Synthetic polymers
are ubiquitous and among the most extensively
manufactured materials on earth. The environmental impact and sustainability
of any alternative synthetic polymer are therefore important to consider.
However, the majority of synthetic polymers are produced from limited
resources derived from petrochemicals.1 There is, therefore, a current goal in materials chemistry to identify
sustainable building blocks that provide monomers generated from alternative
sources, such as industrial waste.

Elemental sulfur is not only
an abundant naturally occurring mineral;
it is also produced as a byproduct from the petrochemicals industry.
Sulfur is removed from crude oil and natural gas during refining.2 Currently, the supply of sulfur outweighs demand,
leading to vast unwanted stockpiles. In terms of materials chemistry,
it would seem obvious to try to use this resource to make useful functional
materials. Unfortunately, sulfur naturally occurs as S8, a small cyclic molecule that forms a brittle, crystalline powder,
and thus not useful for making materials from. However, if sulfur
is heated, it first melts and then polymerizes to form linear chains
of sulfur atoms. The resultant ruby red polymer is a solid and could
be used to make materials but it is not stable and readily depolymerizes
back to S8 rings at room temperature. A process termed
inverse vulcanization has been shown to allow high-sulfur-content
polymers to be stabilized against depolymerization by reacting the
sulfur with organic small-molecule dienes, allowing sulfur contents
up to 90 wt %. From this perspective, there is current interest in
exploiting this untapped, low-cost sulfur for materials.3−10

In 2013, Pyun et al. first reported the inverse vulcanization
process.4 In this process, molten sulfur
acts as both a
solvent and a monomer, eliminating the need for any solvents or initiators in traditional polymerization
mechanisms. Since this study, many have shown that inverse vulcanized
sulfur polymers can be prepared successfully with alternative cross-linkers.6 The low cost of sulfur and the unique properties
exhibited by high-sulfur-content polymers, in comparison to those
with a carbon backbone, have captured research interest,6 and inverse vulcanized sulfur polymers have received
considerable attention for wide-ranging applications across Li–S
batteries11 heavy-metal capture,12,13 oil and water separation,14 lenses,15 thermal insulation,16 and self-healing polymers.17

One
application that has received little attention is the antibacterial
properties of high-sulfur-content polymers. Sulfur has been recognized
throughout history as an antibacterial agent, given orally for bacterial
infection and used topically as fungicides and bactericides for the
treatment of cutaneous infections.18 Preventing
biofilm formation is also of wider importance industrially, such as
in coatings for ships’ hulls and pipelines. Despite this, little
experimental work has been carried out to investigate the antibacterial
properties that high-sulfur-content polymers may possess.

More
recently, Lienkamp et al. have studied the antibacterial surface
properties of poly(sulfur-co-diisopropenyl benzene)
(S-DIB).19 The findings show that polymer-covered
surfaces kill up to 72% of Escherichia coli for a sample that contains 50 wt % sulfur.19 With this said, their findings suggest that S-DIB as a cross-linker
is not ideal for antibacterial activity. Although promising, the Lienkamp
study focuses on thin polymer film coatings and only one bacterial
species, applied by spraying, and the antibacterial activity was assessed
over a short time period (between 5 min and 4 h). With both E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus being serious causes of a variety of nosocomial infections,20 the goal of the present study was to expose
both E. coli and S.
aureus to two different types of high-sulfur-content
bulk polymer surfaces, thereby testing the effect on both Gram-positive
and -negative species. To investigate the antibacterial activity,
two polymers exhibiting different structural properties were chosen:
S-DIB and sulfur dicyclopentadiene (S-DCPD) (Figure 1). S-DIB is a shape-persistent, stable, hyperbranched
polymer (Figure S1), whereas4 S-DCPD is a highly cross-linked polymer (Figure S2).12 Here,
we compare the antibacterial activity of two different types of inverse
vulcanized sulfur polymers as robust, homogeneous, bulk solids rather
than thin coatings that would be more subject to imperfections and
damage. Inverse vulcanized S-DCPD and S-DIB polymers were successfully
prepared at a ratio of 50 wt % sulfur content, similarly to previously
published inverse vulcanization reactions (see Electronic Supporting Information (ESI) for details).4,12

prepared to dimensions of 30 x 30 x 3 mm3.

Results and Discussion
Briefly, elemental sulfur was heated
at 160 °C until it melted
and became a pale orange liquid. Subsequently, the cross-linker (DCPD/DIB)
was then added directly into molten sulfur and further heated for
20–30 min until a homogeneous mixture was formed. The mixture
was then poured into a mold of dimensions of 30 × 30 × 3
mm3 and cured for 12–14 h at 130
°C to form solid squares suitable for further
testing.

To determine if the resultant polymer surfaces possessed
antibacterial
effects, fluorescent microcopy using LIVE/DEAD BacLight was used to
examine the response of E. coli to
exposure to both polymer surfaces, S-DCPD and S-DIB surfaces, and
to examine responses on polycarbonate (PC) control surfaces. E. coli was incubated on the three surfaces independently
by immersing each surface in a 1:500 diluted nutrient broth (see ESI for further details). The cell density reached
∼ 1 × 108 cells/mL after incubation for 24
h. The cells were visualized on the various surfaces via fluorescent
microscopy. There was no exponential growth of the E. coli and no biofilm formation was detected (see ESI for further details). Micrographs (Figures 2, S9–S17) indicated that S-DIB surfaces significantly
reduced the percentage of live cells (green) (29.9 ± 12.9% survival)
compared to both S-DCPD (49.6 ± 9.0% survival) and the control
sample (84.7 ± 4.1%). Furthermore, no noticeable variations were
observed for the total cell numbers on the surface of the control
and copolymer surfaces after 24 h.

respectively. Observation was achieved using a 100x objective lens.

To accurately quantify bacterial
survival, we employed a standardized
methodology (ISO 22196:2011 [see ESI for
further details on modification]) for testing the antibacterial properties
of a surface. Gram -ve (E. coli ATCC8739)
and Gram +ve (S. aureus DSM347) bacterial
strains were exposed to both polymer surfaces and the number of viable
cells recoverable from the surfaces was measured.

Briefly, surfaces
were held in a Petri dish and seeded with 100
μL of bacterial cell solution (∼3 x 106 cells/mL)
in a 1:100 (S. aureus) or 1:500 (E. coli) nutrient broth and covered with a polyethylene
film. The inoculated surfaces were encased in a humidity chamber to
limit surface evaporation and incubated at 37 °C for 24 or 48
h. To recover the bacteria, the surfaces were washed with 10 mL of
soybean casein digest broth with lecithin and polyoxyethylene sorbitan
monooleate. The recovered cells underwent serial dilutions and plating
on plate count agar and were incubated for 48 h (see ESI for details).

The number of cells of both E. coli (>99.9% reduction, >3 log) and S. aureus (>99.9% reduction, >log 4.9) was
significantly reduced by the S-DIB
surface. (Figure 3,
further details in ESI). This is much higher
in comparison to that in previous investigations, which report a 72%
reduction for E. coli microorganisms
on S-DIB (50 wt % sulfur).19 Both S-DIB
and S-DCPD exhibit strong bactericidal effects on E.
coli microorganisms in comparison to S. aureus, where only S-DIB exhibits a bactericidal
effect on S. aureus. Scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) imaging of the polymer surfaces, after exposure to
the bacteria in equivalent conditions, does not show any significant
biofilm formation (See ESI for details, Figures S18–S23), in agreement with the
findings of confocal microscopy.

and 48 h, in comparison to
the control, as measured by the growth of surface-adhered bacteria

(SCDLP). Data have been normalized. Statistical analysis was carried
on the log-transformed data. *(p-value < 0.05),
** (p-value < 0.01), *** (p-value
< 0.001), NS (not significant). Error bars represent the standard
deviation.

To further understand how the
polymer surfaces may be having an
antibacterial effect on the attached cells, the effect of sulfur leaching
was assessed. Both bacterial strains were cultured in nutrient broth
(NB) into which one of the three surface substrates was placed and
these cultures were incubated at 37 °C (see ESI for details). From Figure 4, no significant difference in recovered c.f.u. was
observed between the presence of the control (1.8 x 108 ± 8.2 x 107, S-DIB (1.6 x 108 ±
4.6 x 107), or S-DCPD (1.4 x 108 ± 1.1
x 108)) substrates for E. coli cells in the planktonic phase. The difference in the cell viability
between the samples is smaller than the standard deviations; this
indicates that the release of any active sulfur-containing material
into the liquid phase was negligible and did not affect cell viability.
This is also supported by the live/dead staining (S9–S17),
as a significant surface effect is observed for E.
coli for both copolymers but there is no change in
bacterial viability in the planktonic phase.

Figure 4 Assessment of antibacterial
effects from substrate leaching based
on bulk substrate submersion in broth culture. Cellular growth quantified
by colony-forming units (cfu)/mL of broth culture after 24 h. Data
have been normalized. NB Error bars represent the standard deviations
from three independent replicates. NS, not significant; p-value, ≥  0.05.

Parallel to this, both differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)
and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) confirm that when both polymer
surfaces are exposed to E. coli and S. aureus, no crystalline sulfur is formed and both
polymers retain an amorphous character (Figures S3–S6). If the polymers were depolymerizing back to
elemental sulfur (S8), this would form crystals detectable
by DSC and PXRD. Therefore, this suggests that the antibacterial effect
arises from the action of the polymer itself, rather than the release
of S8.

Why polysulfides exhibit antibacterial activity
is not yet definitively
understood; however, several mechanisms are suggested throughout the
literature. On comparison of the antibacterial activity, S-DIB exhibits
a greater reduction in cell numbers for both bacteria (Figure 3). Potential reasons for both
polymers exhibiting different degrees of antibacterial activity could
be due to the degree of cross-linking and the molar ratio of sulfur:cross-linker.
It has been reported that polysulfides (RSxR, x ≥ 3)
are toxic against bacteria, fungi, and particular types of human cells,
although the reasons behind this are unknown.21 The central S–S bond in a polysulfide (RSxR, x ≥ 4) is weak in comparison
to terminal S–S bonds, with bond dissociations of alkyltetrasulfides
and disulfides being 146 and 293 kJ mol–1, respectively.21 DCPD has a lower molecular mass than DIB (132
vs 162 g mol–1) for the same number of reactive
double bonds. This means that for S-DIB, there are longer S–S
chains (CSxC, x ≥ 2) between each carbon cross-link.
The longer the polysulfide chains, the weaker the central S–S
bond, and thus the more likely the occurrence of a homolytic S–S
bond cleavage.21−23 This will lead to the formation of CSx.21 The literature
has shown this species to have great biological importance when killing
bacteria, although specific reaction pathways are still unknown.21,23 Although little experimental data have been published with regard
to the effect of sulfur-containing compounds against differentiated
microorganisms, it is apparent that polysulfides appear to have similar
effects against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria.24,25 However, the presence of low-concentration sulfides has been shown
to provide some microorganisms, such as S. aureus, with protection against oxidative stress and certain antibacterial
compounds.26,27 This could explain why we see
subtle differences in S. aureus survival
for S-DCPD treatment but would need to be further studied to confirm
this scenario with the sulfur copolymers used here.

Other reported
potential mechanisms for how polysulfides may kill
bacteria are thiolation reactions, hydrophobic interactions, or Sx transfer reactions, which
all involve leaching, and in some cases, the formation of crystalline
sulfur.21 As the data in this study suggest
that no significant amounts of material containing sulfur are leached
and polymers retain an amorphous character, the most likely mechanism
of action is homolytic bond cleavage.21 This high degree of stability of sulfur within the cross-linked
bulk material is a desirable feature of long-term antibacterial surfaces.
Surfaces associated with leaching or product release have a fixed
lifetime based on the finite amount of antibacterial compounds present.28 Furthermore, the creation of a potential concentration
gradient or a local decrease in antibacterial compounds over time
can lead to issues of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and in vivo
decreases in antibacterial drug concentrations are often associated
with detrimental effects surrounding the host’s immune response.
However, a constitutively active antibacterial surface would be of
more benefit both financially and for a reduction in hospital-acquired
infections or industrial contamination, particularly with respect
to AMR.

Bacterial infections have been considered to be one
of the greatest
threats to human health and are becoming more problematic due to increasing
AMR.28 With endotracheal tubes, vascular
and urinary catheters, and hip prosthetics being responsible for more
than half of the nosocomial infections in the United State,21,28 it is important to research different materials that may exhibit
antibacterial properties for future development, particularly with
the increasing prevalence of AMR. We have demonstrated the ability
of inverse vulcanized sulfur polymers as bulk substrates to act as
antibacterial surfaces against E. coli and S. aureus, the causes of common
persistent bacterial infections. This study reports the highest log
reduction (>log 4.3) of both bacteria on different inverse vulcanized
polymers to date. To fully translate this to a biological setting,
complete knowledge of how the surfaces kill bacteria and the comparison
of different high-sulfur-content polymers are essential. Here, we
provide a vital investigation comparing two structurally different
polymers and highlight key experiments that can help us identify the
potential mechanisms of how these surfaces exhibit an antibacterial
effect. It is interesting to note that while the mechanism of action
is not yet known with certainty, it is not inhibited by the thick
peptidoglycan layer of Gram-positive bacteria.

Conclusions
In
summary, we show the activity of two high-sulfur-content polymers,
as bulk solids, against both Gram-negative and -positive bacteria.
S-DIB is seen to have greater activity than S-DCPD; this could be
attributed to S-DIB having a higher sulfur rank (the number of sulfur
atoms in between each carbon cross-link, CSx), therefore having a weaker central S–S bond promoting homolysis.

The low cost of availability of sulfur on a vast scale provides
the potential for use as antibacterial materials and surfaces in bulk
applications that would not be possible for more expensive or complex
materials. The promising results found already and the difference
in efficacy between these cross-linkers against two bacterial strains
suggest that the broader antibacterial effect of sulfur polymers may
be further improved in the future and certainly warrants further investigation
and development. Future studies into the optimization and mechanism
of the effect of these are needed, as well as an assessment of their
safety within a hospital environment.

Experimental Section
Materials
1,3-Diisopropenyl benzene (DIB) and dicyclopentadiene
(DCPD) were purchased from Tokyo Chemicals Industry. Sulfur was purchased
as 25 kg sacks from Brenntag. E. coli DMS 1576 and S. aureus DSM 346 strains
provided by the University of Liverpool were used for the antimicrobial
surface tests.

Characterization
X-Ray Diffraction (PXRD)
Powder X-ray Diffraction (PXRD)
patterns were carried out on samples using a PAN analytical X’pert
powder diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation.

Differential
Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)
Differential
scanning calorimetry was carried out using Q2000 DSC (TA instruments).
The method was a heat/cool/heat process for three cycles, heating
to 150 °C and cooling to −80 °C at a heating rate
of 5 °C/min with Tzero Hermetic pans.

Scanning Electron Microscopy
(SEM)
Scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) was performed using a Hitachi S-4800 cold-field emission
scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM). Samples were prepared by sticking
them to the SEM stub using conductive silver adhesive paint. The sample
was then coated with chrome using a current of 120 mA for 15 s to
give approximately 15 nm chrome coatings using a Quorum S150T ES sputter
coater. Imaging was conducted at a working distance of between 7.9
and 8.5 mm at an accelerating voltage of 1.5 kV.

Methods
Synthesis of
S-DIB and S-DCPD
Sulfur (10 g) was added
to a 40 mL glass vial equipped with a magnetic stirrer bar and heated
on a hot plate to 165 °C. Molten sulfur was formed (transparent,
yellow solution) and, to this, 1,3-diisopropenyl benzene (DIB)/dicyclopentadiene
(DCPD) (10 g) was added to the mixture via a pipette. The reaction
mixture was heated at 165 °C until homogeneous (15–20
min). The product was then immediately transferred from the glass
vial into a silicone mold of dimensions of 30 × 30 x 3 mm3. This was then cured at 130 °C for 14–16 h.

Bacteria Preparation
Bacterial strains were stored
on nutrient agar containing 10 g L–1 peptone, 5
g L–1 NaCl, 2 g L–1 yeast extract,
5 g L–1 meat extract, and 15 g L–1 agar at pH 7.1 ± 0.1. A scrape of bacteria was transferred
to fresh nutrient agar and incubated for 37 °C for 18 h; this
was then subsequently repeated. A loopful of agar-grown bacteria was
transferred to a nutrient broth (1:500 dilution for E. coli and 1:100 dilution for S.
aureus) containing 5 g L–1 meat
extract, 10 g L–1 peptone (enzymatic digest of casein),
5 g L–1 sodium chloride, and 15 g L–1 agar at pH 7 ± 0.2. The bacterial cells were homogeneously
suspended by vortexing for 10 s and water bath sonication for 10 s.
50 kHz (Grant Ultrasonic XB3). Bacterial enumeration was conducted
using a calibration curve from the spectrophotometer value. The bacterial
suspension was then adjusted to the desired optical density to achieve
a target concentration of 3 × 106 cells mL–1.

Fluorescent Imaging
Testing was conducted on the control
(polycarbonate), SDIB50:50, and SDCPD50:50 surfaces (30 × 30
mm2) and sterilized by submersion in 70% ethanol for 5
min; then, ABS ethanol 10 s. E. coli was grown overnight in LB Broth (15 mL), subcultured into fresh
LB, and grown until an OD600 of 0.4 was achieved. This
subculture (10 mL) was centrifuged at 5000 g for 5 min. The supernatant
was discarded and the pellet was resuspended in 30 mL of 1:500 diluted
LB Broth at a concentration of approximately 107 cells
mL–1. The surface was submerged in the cell suspension
for 24 h. After incubation, the cell suspension was removed and the
surface was gently washed with 0.85% sodium chloride (25 mL) three
times. Live/Dead Baclight Bacterial Viability Kit L7007 was prepared
by placing 1.5 μL of Syto 9 and 1.5 μL of propidium iodide
in 1 mL of 0.85% sodium chloride. From this prepared stain, 1 mL was
placed directly onto the surface and incubated in the dark for 15
min. The surface was washed with 25 mL of 0.85% sodium chloride and
then imaged using a Ziess Plan Apochromat 40x/1.0 DIC VIS-IR objective
(Zeiss Axio Imager 2 microscope).

Assessment of Sulfur Leaching
Both bacterial strains
were inoculated in nutrient broth (NB) at a concentration of 105 cell/mL and a final volume of 30 mL. Substrates were added
to the broth and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The growth was
monitored by determining absorbance at 600 nm and an aliquot of 200
μL was serially diluted and plated on NA using the Miles and
Misra method for the enumeration of colony-forming units (CFU). Data
are shown in Figure 4 of the paper after normalization to set the control as 100%.

Surface
Preparation and ISO Standard Testing
Testing
was conducted on the control (polycarbonate), SDIB50:50, and SDCPD50:50
surfaces (30 × 30 mm2) and sterilized by submersion
in 70% ethanol for 5 min and then ABS ethanol for 10 s. The surfaces
were subsequently dried in a sterile environment using the aseptic
technique. The test surface was placed in a Petri dish with an autoclaved
sponge (20 x 20 mm2) containing 3 mL of sterilized H2O. The bacterial suspension (100 μL, 3 × 106 cell mL–1) was then placed on the test
surface and covered with a polyethylene film (20 × 20 mm2). The Petri dish was placed in a humidity chamber for 24
h. The surface was washed using a serological pipette uptaking and
releasing soybean casein digest broth with lecithin and polyoxyethylene
sorbitan monooleate (SCDLP broth, 10 mL (10×)). The resulting
wash was then ten-fold serially diluted to 10–6 using
sterile phosphate-buffered solution. The dilutions (1 mL) were added
to 15 mL of plate count agar containing 2.5 g L–1 yeast extract, 5 g tryptone L–1, 1 g glucose L–1, and 15 g agar L–1 at pH 7.1 ±
0.1 and incubated at (35 ± 1) °C for 40 to 48 h (any modifications
to the ISO 22196 were stated in the methods section; however, the
protocol was followed as closely as possible). Data are shown in Figure 3 of the main paper
after normalization to set the control as 100%.

Bacteria Enumeration
and Statistical Analysis
For each
dilution series, the colony number was recorded and converted to recovered
bacteria using the formula CFU/mL = (colony number x dilution factor)
x 10. The antibacterial activity was calculated using the following
formula  where R represents the antibacterial
activity, A is the average number of viable bacteria
immediately after inoculation on the control specimen, B is the average number of viable bacteria on the control specimen
after 24 h, and C is the average number of viable
bacteria on the antibacterial specimen after 24 h.

Fixation of
Bacterial Cells for SEM Analysis
Surfaces
were prepared as described in the “Surface preparation and
ISO standard testing” section and then washed with PBS three
times. The bacteria on the surface were then fixed with a 2.5% glutaraldehyde
solution in sterile PBS for 4 h. The bacteria were then dehydrated
in increasing concentrations of ethanol (30, 50, 75,90, 95, and 100
v/v %) by soaking for 5 min in each ethanol concentration. The samples
were dried in air and stored at 4 °C before SEM imaging.

Note on
Lighting Conditions
All bacterial testing was
carried out under ambient indoor lighting. While the light levels
were relatively low, it should be noted that incident light, particularly
UV light, might influence the frequency of S–S bond cleavage,
and therefore bactericidal activity.
