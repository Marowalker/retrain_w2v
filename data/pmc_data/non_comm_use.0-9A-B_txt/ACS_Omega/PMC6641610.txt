Narrow band-gap lead
chalcogenides have been developed for several
optical and electronic applications. However, band-gap energies of
the ternary and quaternary alloys have received little attention compared
with the parent binary phases. Here, we have fabricated single-phase
ternary (PbTe)1–x(PbSe)x and quaternary (PbTe)0.9–y(PbSe)0.1(PbS)y and
(PbTe)0.65–z(PbSe)0.35(PbS)z alloys and shown that although
lattice parameters follow Vegard’s law as a function of composition,
the band-gap energies exhibit a substantial bowing effect. The ternary
(PbTe)1–x(PbSe)x system features a smaller bowing parameter predominantly due
to the difference in electronegativity between Se and Te, whereas
the larger bowing parameters in quaternary alloys are generated from
a larger crystal lattice mismatch and larger miscibility gap. These
findings can lead to further advances in tuning the band-gap and lattice
parameters for optical and electronic applications of lead chalcogenides.

Introduction
Lead chalcogenides (PbQ, Q = Te, Se, S)
are unique compared with
other semiconductors due to their interesting electronic and transport
properties, such as narrow band gaps, low resistivities, large carrier
mobilities, and positive temperature coefficients, showing an increase
in the energy of band gap with temperature.1−3 These optical
and electronic properties have led to the development of lead chalcogenides
for several applications, including infrared lasers and detectors,4 thermophotovoltaics,5 infrared optoelectronic devices,6 photovoltaics,7 and thermoelectrics.8−11

The optical and thermoelectric
properties of lead chalcogenides
have been shown to vary significantly with alloying.11−15 Despite significant recognition of band engineering in lead chalcogenide
alloys,11,16,17 the band-gap
energies of ternary and quaternary lead chalcogenides have received
little attention in contrast to the parent binary phases of PbTe,
PbSe, and PbS. Conventional semiconductor physics wisdom suggests
that “band-gap bowing” is a common effect in semiconductor
alloy systems12,18−21 and that it is likely present
in lead chalcogenide alloys as well. Regardless, many authors have
overlooked this and assumed that lead chalcogenide alloy band gaps
change linearly with composition, in a similar way to their lattice
parameters.8,14,22,23 This work aims to provide a better understanding
of the band gap and bowing parameters for a wide range of lead chalcogenide
alloys, to provide fundamental information required to tune the energy
gap for optoelectronic and electronic applications.

In this
work, we have fabricated intrinsic polycrystalline single-phase
bulk ternary and quaternary lead chalcogenide alloys and measured
their room-temperature energy gaps. The ternary system of (PbTe)1–x(PbSe)x was selected to determine the effect of PbSe content on the band-gap
energy of PbTe. Whereas, quaternary samples of (PbTe)0.9–y(PbSe)0.1(PbS)y and (PbTe)0.65–z(PbSe)0.35(PbS)z were specially fabricated to elucidate
the effects of PbS alloying on the band gap of ternary solid solution
alloys of (PbTe)0.9(PbSe)0.1 and (PbTe)0.65(PbSe)0.35, respectively.

We show that
although the lattice parameter variation of alloys
with composition follows Vegard’s law, the energy gaps exhibit
nonlinearity. The measured room-temperature band gaps, as a function
of composition, consistently differ from any linear projection and
show a deviation, with a parabolic function (bowing). Bowing parameters
have been determined for ternary and quaternary systems, and factors
influencing the degree of bowing are described in detail.

Results and Discussion
Extrinsically doped semiconductors show high charge-carrier concentrations
that increase the measured optical band-gap energy values due to the
Burstein–Moss shift.24 Therefore,
all samples in the current study were undoped. The room-temperature
electrical resistivity of sintered samples was measured to assure
negligible effect of intrinsic doping. Extrinsically doped n-type
and p-type lead chalcogenides show room-temperature
resistivity values below 1 mΩ cm, whereas the current study
samples show resistivities between 6 and 90 mΩ cm.25 Nevertheless, the optical band gaps measured
for n-type PbTe samples show a noticeable increase in band-gap energy
due to Burstein–Moss shift for heavily doped samples with carrier
concentrations above 1019 cm–3, corresponding
to electrical resistivities below ∼0.5 mΩ cm.24 This indicates that band-gap energies of current
study samples are hardly affected by the Burstein–Moss effect.

A single-phase sample is also vital in obtaining an accurate band-gap
measurement, as it has been shown that precipitation of secondary
phases can incorrectly increase the measured optical energy gap for
semiconductors.26 The solubility of PbS
in PbTe is very limited due to a large miscibility gap that exists
between these binary compounds where the phase separation occurs27 and results in the precipitation of PbS within
the PbTe matrix at concentrations as low as 4 atom % PbS.28 Therefore, the selected compositions for quaternary
systems lie outside the miscibility gaps wherein only single-phase
alloys can be obtained. The presence of PbSe in quaternary compounds
(PbTe)0.9–y(PbSe)0.1(PbS)y has been shown to increase PbS
solubility in the ternary alloy (PbTe)0.9(PbSe)0.1.9,10

Crystal Structure
X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns
of (PbTe)(1–x)(PbSe)x (x = 0, 0.10, 0.15, 0.35, 0.50,
0.70, 0.85, and 1.0), (PbTe)0.9–y(PbSe)0.1(PbS)y (y = 0, 0.05, 0.08, and 0.9), and (PbTe)0.65–z(PbSe)0.35(PbS)z (z = 0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, and 0.65) samples are shown
in Figure 1a–c,
respectively. All patterns show the single-phase NaCl-type face-centered
cubic structure. Figure 2 shows that diffraction peaks are progressively shifted to a higher
angle by increasing PbSe and PbS concentrations. The lattice parameter
of the PbTe (a = 6.46 Å) phase is larger than
that of PbSe (a = 6.13 Å) and PbS (a = 5.93 Å). Rietveld refinement was employed to accurately determine
lattice parameters of all samples by extrapolating from high angle
diffraction peaks. The results (Figure 1d–f) show that the lattice parameters of the
alloys change linearly with composition and follow Vegard’s
Law, indicating solid solution phases for all systems.

alloys as a function of composition.

and 1.0) system from raw data obtained using diffuse reflectance infrared
Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). (b) Normalized Kubelka–Munk

fit along with a few linear extrapolations to obtain the direct band
gap by the Tauc method.

Optical Band-Gap Energy
The room-temperature absorption
coefficient was calculated using the Kubelka–Munk function
(α/S), where α is the absorption and S the scattering coefficient, respectively. Normalized spectra
are shown in Figure 2a for the ternary (PbTe)(1–x)(PbSe)x (x = 0, 0.10, 0.15, 0.35,
0.50, 0.70, 0.85, and 1.0) system. Optical band-gap energies are determined
by applying the Tauc method, where (αhω)n is extrapolated to zero as a function of
the incoming photon energy (hω) for direct
gap semiconductors (n = 2)24 (Figure 2b for the
(PbTe)(1–x)(PbSe)x system).

Band-gap energies of (PbTe)0.9–y(PbSe)0.1(PbS)y (y = 0, 0.05, 0.08, and 0.9) and (PbTe)0.65–z(PbSe)0.35(PbS)z (z = 0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, and 0.65)
samples were calculated from the normalized Kubelka–Munk graph
shown in Figure 3a,b,
respectively. The shift in energy of the band gaps to higher values
with PbS content is evident in the quaternary samples compared to
that in the ternary system. The band-gap energy of PbS (0.41 eV) is
much higher than that of PbSe (0.27 eV) and PbTe (0.29 eV) and hence
there is a large difference in the energy gap between the PbS-free
samples (PbTe)0.9(PbSe)0.1 and (PbTe)0.65(PbSe)0.35 and the PbTe-free samples (PbSe)0.1(PbS)0.9 and (PbSe)0.35(PbS)0.65, resulting in a larger energy range for the measurements to spread
across.

of the Tauc method for determining direct band gaps.

Figure 4a illustrates
nonlinear variation of the optical band gap of ternary (PbTe)(1–x)(PbSe)x alloys with composition. Although the differences in the measured
band gaps from linear assumption values are small, the adopted measurement
technique DRIFTS has been shown to be reliable in quantifying changes
in the band gap, with high resolution of ±0.004 eV.24 It is evident that the band gaps of (PbTe)(1–x)(PbSe)x alloys vary in a parabolic contour with composition rather than
in a linear relationship. This deviation is due to a phenomenon known
as the bowing effect. This effect has been previously observed in
(PbTe)(1–x)(PbSe)x alloys grown on the (111) BaF2 substrate by the
molecular beam epitaxy method6 (Figure 4a). Although both
studies show a bowing effect, the measured energy gaps are different.
This might have originated from fabrication methods. The molecular
beam epitaxy technique might have introduced point defects in the
structure, resulting in higher carrier concentration, which is shown
to increase the optical band gap due to the Burstein–Moss effect.25

1.0) system as a function
of the PbSe content, compared to those of films grown by the molecular
beam epitaxy method;6 (b) the quaternary
(PbTe)0.9–y(PbSe)0.1(PbS)y system and (c) the (PbTe)0.65–z(PbSe)0.35(PbS)z system as functions of PbS concentration.

Figure 4b,c shows
the calculated linear assumption and measured variation of the direct
band-gap energy with respect to the PbS content for quaternary systems
of (PbTe)0.9–y(PbSe)0.1(PbS)y and (PbTe)0.65–z(PbSe)0.35(PbS)z, respectively. The calculated curve is a linear prediction
of the band gap, using the band-gap energy measured for pure binary
phases of PbTe, PbSe, and PbS. The linear assumption lines in Figure 4b,c are the predicted
variation in the energy of the band gaps with composition between
the ternary alloys of PbS-free (PbTe)0.9(PbSe)0.1 and (PbTe)0.65(PbSe)0.35 and PbTe-free samples
of (PbSe)0.1(PbS)0.9 and (PbSe)0.35(PbS)0.65. The curves in Figure 4b,c fit the parabolic equation for the measured
energies of the band gaps. The experimental data in Figure 4c deviate slightly from the
linear relationship, although the calculated curves for (PbTe)0.9–y(PbSe)0.1(PbS)y compounds show band gaps much smaller than
with the linear assumption and experimental data due to the smaller
band-gap values obtained for binary PbSe, PbTe, and PbS. It is worth
noting that experimental band-gap energies measured for these binary
compounds are equal to values extracted from the literature (Table 1). The composition
gaps in the experimental data in Figure 4a,b exhibit a phase separation region, wherein
the PbS-rich phase precipitates within the PbTe-rich matrix.10,29

The nonlinear nature of the
variation of the optical band gap with
composition is not uncommon and has been observed in a number of classical
semiconductor systems, such as Si–Ge,32 InGaN, AlGaN, AlInN,18 and CdSe-CdTe.33 The bowing parameter in semiconductors is described
by a parabolic polynomial12 1  where Eg,A and Eg,B are intrinsic
energy gaps of the initial
semiconductors A and B and x is the phase ratio of
A that is used to calculate the energy gap of the alloy (Eg,AB). The degree to which the curve deviates from the
linear fit is described by the bowing parameter b.34

Bowing parameters calculated
for ternary and quaternary systems
are summarized in Table 2. The negative sign of bowing parameters is due to the inverted nature
of the parabola for these systems.35 It
is worth noting that the bowing parameter for the (PbTe)0.9–y(PbSe)0.1(PbS)y system has been obtained by fitting limited experimental data, which
can contribute to a larger error value. Nevertheless, the absolute
value of the bowing parameter (b) for the quaternary
(PbTe)0.65–z(PbSe)0.35(PbS)z system (−0.08326 eV) is
much smaller than that for the quaternary (PbTe)0.9–y(PbSe)0.1(PbS)y system (−0.21813 eV), larger than that (−0.052 eV)
for the ternary (PbTe)(1–x)(PbS)x system, and similar to that of the ternary
(PbSe)(1–x)(PbS)x system (−0.190 eV).12 There
are several factors that affect the bowing parameter of solid solution
materials, including ionicity and crystal structure mismatch, solubility,
electron potential, and electronegativity.8,12,33,36

(PbSe)(1–x)(PbS)x12	–(0.190 ± 0.045)	
Atomic Size and Ionicity
The atomic size and ionicity
mismatch of the atoms have been shown to be the main cause for bowing
of band gaps in solid solution semiconductor alloys.20,32,34 In systems such as (Zn, Mg, Be)O,34 BaTiO3–CaTiO3,
BaTiO3–BaZrO3, SrTiO3–BaZrO3,32 and MgxZn1–xSe,20 there are large variations in the atomic size and ionicity of participant
atoms, which are believed to cause the band-gap bowing.

Lattice
parameters of PbTe (6.50 Å) and PbSe (6.12 Å) are very similar
but larger than those of PbS (5.94 Å). Concurrently, Se ions
(1.98 Å) are slightly smaller than Te ions (2.21 Å), and
both are larger than S ions (1.84 Å). All have valence 2–. Therefore, it is unlikely that atomic size and ionicity
play a significant role in the observed bowing of the band gap in
ternary (PbTe)(1–x)(PbSe)x and (PbSe)(1–x)(PbS)x systems. On the other hand, replacing
Te with S atoms in quaternary systems creates a slightly larger lattice
mismatch that, in turn, increases the bowing parameter.36

Electronegativity
The electronegativity
of individual
anions bonded to cations has also been identified as a major factor
determining the degree to which band-gap bowing occurs in alloys.33 The electronegativity effect is used to measure
an atom’s ability to draw electrons from surrounding atoms
toward it. It is determined by the atomic number and how far the outer
electrons lie from the inner nucleus. The Pauling scale is the most
frequently used method to compare electronegativities, in which fluorine
is given the highest value of 4.0, and this value decreases down through
all elements to cesium and francium at 0.7.31

Electronegative values of Te, Se, and S atoms are 2.10, 2.55,
and 2.58, respectively, according to the Pauling scale. The band-gap
bowing in the ternary (PbTe)(1–x)(PbS)x system might be attributed to
the larger electronegativity of Se ions compared to that of Te ions
(2.55 > 2.10). It is unlikely, however, that replacing Te ions
with
S ions with slightly larger electronegativity (2.58 > 2.55) in
quaternary
systems could cause bowing in the energy gaps.

Valence Electron Potential
Similar to electronegativity,
conflicting valence electron potentials of individual atoms in a specific
system have also been identified to play a significant role in the
band-gap bowing of alloys. This valence electron potential is a quantitative
indication of the reactivity of individual atoms and can be calculated
using the equation37 2  where −eV is the valence
electron potential, n is the number of valence electrons, r is the ionic radius (Å), and k is
the proportionality factor used to convert angstrom (Å) into
centimeter (cm) and transform the force of valence electrons into
electron volt (eV).

The valence electron potential of S (160
eV) is higher than that of Se (120 eV) and is much higher than that
of Te (59 eV), suggesting an increase in the core potential fluctuation
and increased deviation from the symmetric alloy behavior.35 Therefore, one would expect that quaternary
systems show a larger bowing parameter than that of ternary compounds.

Solubility
The solubility of two compounds is directly
linked to the magnitude of bowing in the band gaps of their alloys.
Solubility is a direct reflection of atomic size, ionicity, and electronegativity.38 Alloys that contain large regions where phase
separation occurs tend to have larger bowing parameters than those
of alloys with minimal or no miscibility gaps.33,35

It is evident from the pseudobinary phase diagram of PbSe–PbTe
that the miscibility gap only occurs at temperatures below 170 K for
(PbTe)(1–x)(PbSe)x alloys.39 Hence, the solubility
factor has minimal influence on the band-gap bowing of the (PbTe)(1–x)(PbSe)x system, although it might result in bowing of band gap for (PbTe)0.9–y(PbSe)0.1(PbS)y and (PbTe)0.65–z(PbSe)0.35(PbS)z systems,
as their alloys have a sizeable miscibility gap.29 The size of the miscibility gap for the (PbTe)0.65–z(PbSe)0.35(PbS)z system is much smaller than that of the (PbTe)0.9–y(PbSe)0.1(PbS)y system.29 Therefore, one would expect
to observe a larger bowing parameter for the (PbTe)0.9–y(PbSe)0.1(PbS)y system. Both quaternary systems show larger bowing parameters than
those of ternary (PbTe)1–x(PbSe)x alloys, with complete solubility over the
whole composition range.

The solubility, atomic size, and ionicity
factors suggest minimal
band-gap bowing for ternary (PbTe)(1–x)(PbSe)x and (PbSe)(1–x)(PbS)x systems, whereas,
the electron potential and electronegativity predict bowing in the
energy of band gaps in the ternary (PbTe)(1–x)(PbSe)x system. It is worth noting
that the band gap for ternary (PbSe)(1–x)(PbS)x alloys was determined for
nanocrystals, suggesting that the bowing is influenced by quantum
confinement and changes of the quantum dot size.12 A linear relationship of band-gap energy with composition
is expected for bulk (PbSe)(1–x)(PbS)x alloys. On the other hand, the
atomic size, electronegativity, and solubility that result in spinodal
decomposition (below 1050 K) in the PbTe–PbS system appear
to be likely factors behind the band-gap bowing of quaternary systems.

A potential reason for the reduced bowing parameter in the (PbTe)0.65–z(PbSe)0.35(PbS)z system compared to that of the (PbTe)0.9–y(PbSe)0.1(PbS)y system is the smaller miscibility gap that
exists between the (PbTe)0.65(PbSe)0.35 and
(PbSe)0.35(PbS)0.65 phases in the (PbTe)0.65–z(PbSe)0.35(PbS)z system compared to that between (PbTe)0.9(PbSe)0.1 and (PbSe)0.1(PbS)0.9 in the (PbTe)0.9–y(PbSe)0.1(PbS)y system.

Conclusions
The unique physical properties of Pb chalcogenides have led to
their development for several optical and electronic applications,
wherein the tuned band-gap energy can tailor electronic transport
properties. Herein, intrinsic polycrystalline samples of ternary and
quaternary Pb chalcogenide alloys were fabricated and their optical
band-gap energies and lattice parameters were measured as a function
of composition. Although lattice parameters of these alloys follow
Vegard’s equation, the band-gap energies exhibit nonlinear
relationships with compositions. We have determined the bowing parameters
for these systems.

The ternary (PbTe)1–x(PbSe)x system featured a small
amount of band-gap
bowing, predominantly due to the difference in electronegativity between
Se and Te. Bowing parameters for the quaternary (PbTe)0.9–y(PbSe)0.1(PbS)y system are larger than those for (PbTe)0.65–z(PbSe)0.35(PbS)z due to the larger crystal lattice mismatch and miscibility
gap. This opens up promising perspectives for tuning the band-gap
energy and lattice parameters of Pb chalcogenide alloys for optical
and electronic applications.

Methods
Sample Fabrication
Intrinsic polycrystalline samples
of PbS, PbSe, and PbTe were prepared by mixing stoichiometric ratios
of high purity Pb (99.999%), Se (99.999%), and dried S (99.99%) in
vacuum-sealed quartz ampoules. These were reacted at 1373 K to produce
high purity PbS, PbSe, and PbTe. The final polycrystalline samples
of ternary and quaternary compounds of (PbTe)1–x(PbSe)x (x = 0, 0.15, 0.35, 0.50, 0.70, 0.85, and 1), (PbTe)0.9–y(PbSe)0.1(PbS)y (y = 0, 0.05, 0.08, and 1), and (PbTe)0.65–z(PbSe)0.35(PbS)z (z = 0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, and 1) were
synthesized by mixing stoichiometric quantities of high purity PbS,
PbSe, Pb, and Te. The mixtures were sealed in carbon-coated quartz
tubes under vacuum, reacted at 1373 K for 10 h, and then cooled to
room temperature in the furnace. The resulting ingots were hand-ground
to powder in an agate mortar and used to measure the energy of band
gaps.

XRD Analysis
The crystallographic structure of samples
was characterized by XRD using a GBC Scientific X-ray diffractometer
with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.544 Å, 40 kV, 30 mA).
To measure phase ratios and calculate lattice parameters, XRD patterns
were refined using the Rietveld analysis.

Infrared Optical Properties
Room-temperature diffuse
reflectance spectra of finely ground powders were recorded using a
Shimadzu IRPrestige-21 Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectrophotometer
equipped with diffuse reflectance. The spectra were monitored in the
mid-IR region (6000–400 cm–1), which were
then converted to electron volts (eV) using Planck’s law. Absorption
data (α/S) were calculated from reflectance
data via the Kubelka–Munk transformation. Optical energy gaps
were extracted using the Tauc method.40
