1 Introduction
Energy is increasingly in demand around the world.1,2 Hydrogen (H2) is an alternative energy source for fossil
fuel.3,4 Numerous inorganic semiconductors work as
candidates of photocatalytic H2 production for practical
applications.5,6 Nevertheless, there exists low
visible-light activity, difficult preparation conditions, and rare
low-cost elements among them.7,8

Compared with
inorganic photocatalysts, conjugated polymers (CPs)
work as semiconductors for photocatalytic H2 production
(PHP), thanks to high degree of flexibility, low-price fabrication,
bulk synthesis, and multifunctionalization.9,10 Following
the pioneer report of various zinc (Zn)-based polymers, such as semi-crystallized
bipyridine-based frameworks, poly(arylene ethynylene) (PAE)-covalent
organic frameworks and benzothiadiazole-conjugated porous polymers
have been further investigating for photocatalysis,11−13 while there
exists several shortcomings among them, multistep synthesis or poor
quantum efficiency (QE).14,15 In this regard, developing
CPs with visible-light photocatalysts still remain an extraordinary
challenge currently.16,17 It indicates that metal-binding
and visible-light-absorbing polymer with a PAE backbone show quite
interesting building blocks, expected to be novel photocatalytic systems.
It also offers to tune the optical properties of the PAE-based ligand,
including the catalytic and optical properties of the coordinated
metal complexes.18,19

It is necessary for obtaining
ideal CPs, including broad wavelength,
proper energy levels, and high-efficiency charge transfer.20,21 A variety of building blocks are used for constructing CPs’
aim to realize these desirable properties simultaneously.22,23 Besides, PAE is extraordinary attractive owing to its conjugating
plane structure, in favor of charge separation and transport when
introduced with PAE.24,25 In addition, bithiazole (BTz)-bridged
polymer receives a great deal of uses, including benzothiadiazole
moiety, especially for PHP.26−28 Thus, the incorporation of CPs
into BTz, and the corresponding polymers were systematically characterized
(Scheme 1).29−34 Moreover, these samples were investigated for photocatalytic activity
under visible light.

2 Results
and Discussion
The precursor PAE–BTz was then subjected
to reaction with
zinc chloride, affording the target Zn–COF in over 85% yield
(Scheme S1 and Table 1). The optical absorption profile of the
prepared polymers was determined by diffuse reflectance UV–vis
and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. UV–vis spectra show
obvious changes between the PAEs (Figure 1), showing a redshift from 420 to 590 nm
with increasing BTz content, when moving from 4a to 4e. It is beneficial to adjust the optical properties in the
PAE networks, whereas the optical gap is regulated by alternating
the molar ratio of the monomer between 3 and ZnCl2 (Table 1).
With the help of UV–vis absorption measurements, there exists
a distinct bathochromic shift along with the as-grown sample other
than monomers, demonstrating the extension of conjugated π system,
thanks to alkynyl coupling with electron delocalization.35

studies.

The PL spectrum
for PAE, the sample without BTz is blue, shows
a maximum characteristic emission (445 nm). In contrast, the emission
of specimens containing BTz moieties (4a–4e) exhibited
a gradual redshift. The polymer 4a reached its peak with
a bluish-green emission (465 nm), whereas 4b reached
its peak with a saturated green/yellow emission (534 nm), and 4c with a red emission (588 nm) (Figure 2). It is suggested that PAE–BTzs contain
cyclic structures, manifesting itself as a redshift in the PL spectrum.
Because of its planar nature, an increase was observed for high electric
conduction in the copolymer series by the function of PAE.36

Figure 2 Emission spectra of PAE–BTz–Zn 4a–4e and PAE.

Aiming to the excited state dynamics,
the fluorescence lifetime
of polymers was evaluated. As given in Table 1, the BTz-linked polymer 4c reveals
the least fluorescence lifetime (τ1 = 0.54 ns, τ2 = 3.89 ns, Table 1) in those polymer networks. The decreased fluorescence intensity
is obviously combined with localized states in the band gap loaded
with BTz moiety.37 It is certainly beneficial
to transfer charge carriers in the photocatalytic reactions.38

The porous property of the as-synthesized
polymers was determined
by N2 sorption measurements at 77 K. The calculated Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) and Langmuir surface area values for those samples are present
in Table 2, varying
from 85.4 to 189.3 m2 g–1. Among them,
the sample 4c exhibits the highest apparent SBET (189.3 m2 g–1, Table 1). N2 uptake
at a low relative pressure (P/P0 < 0.05) illustrates moderate porous structure, besides
having a pore size smaller than 2 nm. The observed hysteresis loop
results from the elastic deformation of the cross-linked network in
the N2 atmosphere. The sharp rise at high-pressure regions
(P/P0 = 0.9–1.0)
is good for macropores (>50 nm) or absorbance at the external surface
area or textural porosity in these materials. It has been demonstrated
that the large specific surface area corresponds to more reactive
sites in favor of the photocatalysis procedure, thanks to the abundant
catalytically active sites, both on the edges and PAE basal planes.39 The reason may be ascribed to the low degree
of π–π stacking among the adjacent PAE layers,
leading to offset stacking in the framework. As for that, it suits
the moderate surface area in the system.40

light irradiation (λ

The structure
of the as-prepared PAE sample 4c was
measured by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). From Figure 3a, the margin between
PAE film and Zn complex is observed. The typical layered structure
of the as-obtained PAE can be observed above the interface, demonstrating
the π-stacking interlayer distance from two-dimensional layers
(Figure 3b). High-resolution
TEM (HR-TEM) illustrated curved streaks with a lattice parameter of
0.369 nm that belongs to the interlayer distance of PAE (Figure 3c).41 Meanwhile, selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern
is shown in Figure 3d as well. The plane (100) is presented in the inset, and its intensity
integrates to more than 360°. It is over graphene attribute to
a more delocalized system of PAE. The component of sample 4c was further shown for Zn, O, N, S, and C by energy-dispersive X-ray
(EDX) spectrum (Figure 3e), which coincides with the result of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) analysis and energy-dispersive system mapping. It implied that
the two-dimensional-layered PAE film with good crystallinity was acquired
successfully.42

Figure 3 TEM (a,b), HR-TEM (c),
SAED (d), and EDX (e) images of specimen 4c.

Among them, N and S originated from both PAE and BTz ligands
in
the system, as confirmed by the XPS data (Figure S14). N (1s) reached its peak at approximately 397.8, 399.7,
and 400.7 eV, stating that thiazole coordinated with zinc ions and
benzothiadiazole N, respectively.43 In
the XPS spectrum of S (2p), a peak was observed at around 163.0 and
164.4 eV attributed to S from carbon sulfur bond,
and another peak at around 160.6 and 161.8 eV corresponding to S from
thiazole and benzothiadiazole from the catalyst.44

The amount of the corresponding polymers 4a–4e is 11–17 mg mL–1, respectively (Table 2). Increasing the
concentration of PAE should be a good strategy to further improve
the quantum yield and H2 generating rate.45 To access the photocatalytic activities of samples 4a–4e, the PHP experiments were carried out when triethanolamine
(TEOA) worked as a sacrificial reagent (Table 2, Figure 4). Prior to the actual PHP experiment, control evaluations
were measured by a pure TEOA solution with either photocatalysis or
irradiation. No apparent H2 was produced, implying that
H2 comes from the TEOA solution by photocatalysis in these
photocatalytic reactions.46 The results
show that the ratio between BTz and PAE has an apparent effect on
the photocatalytic performance in the system (Figure 4a). The photocatalytic performance of these
catalysts increased when the BTz content increases, and the largest
activity of H2 evolution acquired for 4c (14.32
mmol h–1 g–1, QE = 6.79%) far
surpasses pure PAE (0.05 mmol h–1 g–1); furthermore, its rate exceeds dramatically that of benzodithiophene-based
complex.21 When the content of Zn increased
persistently, the H2 generation activity of the BTz–PAE
specimen obviously decreased, owing to the higher opacity and stronger
light scattering from the higher contents of BTz. It is noted that
BTz and PAE show positive synergistic effects on the H2 producing performance of Zn–COF.

Figure 4 Photocatalytic properties
of these samples (0.05 g) in an aqueous
solution (100 mL) including TEOA as a hole scavenger with visible-light
irradiation: (a) H2 evolved rate of specimens 4a–4e and pure PAE, respectively (irradiation time = 3 h); (b) photocatalytic
H2 evolution of sample 4c in different water
qualities; and (c) stability test of specimen 4c during
photocatalytic H2 generation.

The QE of sample 4c was determined under different
monochromatic light, as shown in Figure S17. The largest QE of 8.91% was presented at 450 nm. Regarding the
remarkable photocatalytic properties, sample 4c demonstrated
a great stability after discontinuous photocatalytic measurement and
shelved for a month, as illustrated in Figure 4b; only 10% descend of H2 production
can be observed. In addition, sample 4c also exhibits
supreme photocatalytic performance under different water qualities
(Figure 4c). Although
the inorganic salt components are complicated in seawater, a practically
identical H2 generating rate (11.21 mmol h–1 g–1) with that in 3 wt % NaCl was acquired as
well.47

Electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy (EIS) and transient photocurrent
detections evaluated the interface interaction between PAE–BTz
and Zn. As shown in Figure 5, from EIS changes of PAE–BTz–Zn 4a–4e electrodes, the highest one was the specimen 4c photoelectrode. This leads to improvements in charge-separation
efficiencies, leading to a less curvature radius and a smaller resistance
in charge transfer.48 Therefore, sample 4c possesses higher charge-transportation efficiency than
other samples, possessing a similar topology to that coordinated with
Zn-oxo clusters.

Figure 5 EIS of the composites 4a–4e.

In particular, a drastic shrink of the semicircular
Nyquist plots
from Figure S18 is observed for sample 4c in the night, revealing that the conjugated structures
from the polymeric matrix could efficiently cut down the resistance
on the interface, benefiting the photoexcited charge carrier isolation
in the photocatalytic process.49

Furthermore, it has an essential effect on the charge dissociation
efficiency of PAE–BTz by transient photocurrent tests. These
measurements show that PAE–BTz produces a higher photocurrent
response than pure PAE, demonstrating that photoinduced electron (e–)–hole (h+) pairs are isolated more
effectively (Figure 6). This result further manifests that photoexcited PAE–BTz
needs more time to arrive in the balance than pure PAE.50

Figure 6 Transient photocurrent results of the composites 4a–4e with chopped light illumination of 420 nm at
0.5 V bias vs Ag/AgCl.

In the meantime, a similar
result was given by the transient photocurrent
response test. As illustrated in Figure 6, these as-synthesized photocatalysts’
electrodes show larger photocurrent density, and the specimen 4c has the most outstanding photocharge density. This demonstrates
that 4c is superior to the upper ones in isolating electron–hole
pairs, matching with the biggest one for the H2 evolution
rate. It implied that pristine PAE played an important role in promoting
charge separation and transfer as well.51 However, their photocatalytic activities would decrease when the
PAE amount was over 10%, owing to agglomeration and low solubility.
The reason may be further explained the enough conductive electron
mediator could not connect to the large PAE additive, restricting
the isolation of photoexcited electrons and holes.52

After exposure to prolonged visible-light irradiation
for as long
as 2 days (Figure S20), the photocurrent
of sample 4c was beginning to decrease, remained a stable
value followed. This phenomenon confirms the prohibition of photocorrosion
of PAE planar architecture.53

To
further investigate the electronic route for the PHP process,
the corresponding mechanism tested the physicochemical behaviors of
the photocatalysts (Figure 7).54 In the photocatalytic reaction,
the water reduction is the most essential step, where PAE and the
(100) crystal plane of Zn are models, respectively. In the photoexcitation
of the PAE–BTz–Zn system in the presence of TEOA, the
excited state PAE moiety is formed, and it is then quenched by BTz
to produce the reduced state Zn moiety. Electrons may be transferred
from the PAE unit to zinc sheet through the electron–electron
exchange of BTz groups of polymers, and thus, protons are reduced
to H2 on the surface of Zn lattice plane.55 This procedure isolated the photogenerated electrons and
holes, resulting in improving the photocatalytic performance for H2 generation and efficient photocorrosion inhibition.56

Figure 7 Illustration of photocatalytic H2 evolution
over hybrid 4c using TEOA as a hole scavenger.

As shown in Figure S21, in both materials,
a narrow isotropic electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) message with
a g datum of g = 2.0041 and Lorentzian
line shape was tested, even in the night. It showed that the paramagnetic
centers were in the PAE framework.57 The g datum revealed that this message was ascribed to surface-trapped
electrons, containing preferential carbon character. The conduction
band (CB) is generated by carbon 2p orbitals, whereas trapped CB-e– was acquired for analyzing the EPR message intensity
with illumination (Figure S21, red spectra).58 The reformation between CB-e– and holes was seen after light burn out (Figure S21, gray spectra). To an extent, conjugation of the upper
polymer was influenced by charge separation and transport.59−61

3 Conclusions
Visible-light-driven H2 generation was realized over
novel BTz-based zinc polymers (PAE–BTz:Zn = 1:5) up to 14.32
mmol h–1 g–1. Furthermore, on
the basis of the successful electron transfer from the photosensitizer
arylene ethynylene to isolated zinc polymers, the resulting new material
reaches over 8.91% for QE (λ = 450 nm). It also opens up potential
routes for porous organic polymers as candidates to develop the new
artificial photosynthesis system, even for using seawater.

resistivity >18 MΩ × cm–1.

The
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed with a TGA Q600 SDT
TA Instruments apparatus (New Castle, DE, USA) at a heating rate of
10 °C/min under dry nitrogen (flow velocity 10 mL/min).

4.2 Synthetic Procedures of Compounds 1–4
Syntheses of compounds 1 and 2 are reported
in the literature.

4.3 Preparation of Compound 3
To a 10 mL flask equipped with a rubber seal and
a magnetic stirring
bar were added PdCl2(PPh3)2 (14.0
mg, 0.02 mmol), 2-(5-bromo-2-(5-bromo-4-(2-hydroxyphenyl)thiazol-2-yl)thiazol-4-yl)phenol 1 (1.1 mmol), and CuI (3.8 mg, 0.02 mmol). Afterward, tetrahydrofuran
(3.0 mL) was injected into the flask, and Ar2 was bubbled
into the solution. After the mixture was stirred for 5 min, a solution
of 4,7-diethynyl-5,6-bis(octyloxy)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole 2 (1.0 mmol) in THF (2.0 mL) was added to the flask successively,
and the mixture was stirred under a balloon pressure of Ar2 at 120 °C for 4 h. The precipitate was filtered, washed with
methanol, and then purified by column chromatography (silica gel,
petroleum ether–ethyl acetate) to afford compound 3.

4.4 Typical Procedure for the Synthesis of Photocatalyst 4
A mixture of 2-(2-(5-(2-(5,6-bis(octyloxy)-7-(prop-1-ynyl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-yl)ethynyl)-4-(2-hydroxyphenyl)thiazol-2-yl)-5-methylthiazol-4-yl)phenol
(3, 0.8193 g) and anhydrous ZnCl2 (0.1363
g) (molar ratio: 1:1) was added into a quartz ampoule inside a glovebox.
The ampoule was then evacuated, vacuum-sealed, and then heated at
450 °C for 12 h. The heating rate is 5 °C × min–1. The obtained yellow powder was subsequently ground
and washed thoroughly with dilute 2 M HCl, water, acetone, and dichloromethane.
The desired product was dried in an oven at 80 °C. Besides, different
contents of ZnCl2 (1:1, 1:3, 1:5, 1:10, and 1:20, molar
ratio) were used toward the synthesis of Zn–N–O with
a diverse Zn loading by following the same procedure as above.

4.5 Steady-State UV–Vis Absorption Measurements
UV absorption peaks were measured by a Hitachi U-3010 absorption
spectrophotometer with THF as the solvent. In addition, the corresponding
samples were solved in THF to a 10 μM concentration prior to
the measurements, unless otherwise stated.

4.6 Steady-State
PL Measurements
PL spectra
were measured by Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer, with
the excitation wavelength of 370 ± 5 nm. Moreover, the solid
fluorescence quantum yield (ϕPL) values were determined,
employing a calibrated integrating sphere system (λexc = 370 ± 5 nm).

4.7 PL Lifetime Measurements
Time-resolved
PL decay spectra were tested at room temperature with an Edinburgh
FLS 920 Fluorescence spectrometer.

4.8 Physicochemical
Characterization
Crystallographic information for the as-synthesized
samples was obtained
on an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker, Germany) with monochromatized
Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm).

The detailed morphology
and structure of the products were recorded by TEM, HR-TEM, and SAED,
on a JEM-2100 apparatus with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. EDX
spectroscopy was also given from an EDAX detector performed on the
same HR-TEM.

The chemical compositions and surface states of
those samples were
probed with an XPS (Axis Ultra DLD, Kratos) instrument.

The
BET specific surface area of as-synthesized photocatalysts
was evaluated at 77 K with a Quantochrome NOVA 1200e instrument.

Infrared (IR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker Tensor 27 Fourier
transform IR (FT-IR) spectrometer by the KBr salt slice method in
the absorption range of 4000–400 cm–1.

Raman spectroscopy was measured using a Renishaw 514.5 nm argon
laser.

4.9 Photoelectronic Measurements
Photoelectrochemical
and EIS measurements were carried out by an electrochemical analyzer
(CHI660C Instruments, Shanghai, China) with a conventional three-electrode
system. Prior to these experiments, the film electrodes of sample 4a–4e were prepared at first. The as-prepared sample
was employed as the working electrode; the counter electrode and the
reference electrode were platinum mesh and an Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl),
respectively. TEOA (10%, v/v) was mixed with Na2SO4 (0.5 mol ×L–1) aqueous solution as
the supporting electrolyte.

The measured potentials versus the
Ag/AgCl reference electrode were converted to the reversible hydrogen
electrode (RHE) scale via the Nernst equation  where ERHE is
the converted potential versus RHE, EAg/AgCl is the experimental potential measured against the Ag/AgCl reference
electrode and is the standard potential of Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl)
at room temperature (i.e., 0.197).

Both linear sweep voltammetry
and photocurrent-time response (I–t) experiments were conducted
in a three-electrode system, and the scan rate was 20 mV × s–1. The photocurrent densities were produced at a bias
of −0.4 V versus RHE in the dark and visible-light irradiation
(λ > 420 nm, light on/off cycles: 20 s). The photostability
measurement was performed under the same condition. Besides, EIS spectrum
of the as-prepared samples was measured by following the identical
procedure, according to the previous reference.

Electron spin
resonance (ESR) spectra were recorded with an ESR
spectrometer (Bruker EMX-10). Before testing, the as-synthesized samples,
respectively, immersed in an aqueous solution (2 mL) including lactic
acid (10%, v/v) were added to the cell, evacuated at 77 K to remove
dissolved oxygen, and then illuminated for 30 min under visible light
(λ > 420 nm) at room temperature. Meanwhile, ESR spectra
for
the composite 3 without visible-light illumination (control) is shown
in Figure S9g.

Cyclic voltammetry
was also measured by an electrochemical analyzer
(CHI660C Instruments, Shanghai, China) consisting of a standard three-electrode
setup, as mentioned above. TBAPF6 and ferrocenium–ferrocene
(Fc+/Fc) worked as the supporting electrolyte and internal
standard, respectively. All of the potentials were determined at a
scan rate of 100 mV·s–1 for oxidation in N2-purged dichloromethane and 100 mV·s–1 for reduction in acetonitrile.

4.9.1 Band Gap Calculation
The energy
band gap (Eg) of the samples was calculated
from the absorption edge of Tauc plot, using the Tauc expression,
given below  where α is the absorption
co-efficient, h is Planck’s constant, and
ν is the wavenumber
(λ). The value of hν is obtained from
the λ. Eg is determined from the
intercept of the extrapolated linear part of the curve with the energy
axis. In another case, the valence band (VB) top position was measured
from the VB XPS plot and CB bottom was calculated by subtracting the Eg. Therefore, the VB and CB potentials of samples 4a–4e are listed in Table 3.

4.10 Photocatalytic Experiments
Typical
photocatalytic experiments were set up as follows. Photocatalytic
performances of as-synthesized samples were evaluated in a closed
gas circulation system equipped with a Pyrex glass reaction cell.
Briefly, a total of each photocatalyst (0.05 g) was, respectively,
loaded into a mixture of lactic acid (10 mL) and water (90 mL) in
the reactor under magnetic stirring. The reactor was placed in a thermoregulated
rack at room temperature with stirring and irradiated using a high-pressure
Xe lamp (300 W) with a UV cutoff filter. In addition, high purity
(99.999%) N2 carrier gas was employed.

4.11 H2 Detected by Online Gas Chromatography
Generated H2 was characterized by gas chromatography
(GC) analysis (GC7900, Tian Mei, Shanghai), equipped with a 5 Å
molecular sieve column and a thermal conductivity detector. The retention
time of H2 was approximately 0.9 min under the same condition.
First of all, a H2 calibration curve was obtained by high
purity (99.999%) H2. Then, the evolved H2 from
the photocatalytic measurement was injected into the online GC to
get the H2 peak area. On the basis of the previous calibration
curve, the actual volume of H2 for those samples was calculated.

4.12 Determination of QE Values
QE was
measured using various monochromatic lights with different band-pass
filters (λ = 420, 450, 480, 510, 540, 570, 600, 630, 660, and

4.13 Characterization
Discussion
The
structures of product 4 (Scheme S1) are characterized by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), IR, differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC), and TGA. The following discussions on
the features reveal that these polymers are obtained indeed as expected.

All of the samples are well-soluble in common solvents such as
THF, DMF, and DMSO, owing to the presence of ether and flexible side
chains, along the macromolecular chains. As determined by GPC (Figure S10), the number-average molecular weight
(Mn) and polydispersity index (PDI) values
of those specimens are in the modest ranges of 1.84–4.14 kDa
and 1.05–1.18, respectively (Table 3). Similarly, the reason is derived from
the enhanced reactivity of long-chain ester groups as well as good
solubility of the polymer in the reaction solution.

According
to upper FT-IR analysis, two peaks were at 1251 and 1451
cm–1, which may be assigned to C–N and C=C
bonds, respectively. The band observed at 1060 cm–1 could be attributed to the stretching vibration of the C–O
bond. The band of 2191 cm–1 is the typical C≡C
stretching vibration, that is in agreement with the result of the
below Raman spectrum. The stretching vibration strength of C/N double
bond in the BTz ring located at 1456 and 1563 cm–1 gradually increases as the BTz content increases for all of the
samples, indicating that the chemical composition of the as-prepared
polymers was fine-tuned by changing the PAE/BTz ratio.

The thermal
properties of the polymers were characterized by TGA
and DSC. The five polymers show good thermal stability with a 5 wt
% weight loss for decomposition temperatures (Td) over 250 °C (Table 3, Figures S11 and S12).
DSC curves clearly exhibited endothermic peaks at 143–190 °C
while being heated, and the corresponding exothermic peaks at 90–121
°C were also observed during cooling. These five polymers exhibited
similar transitional temperatures which may be attributed to the phase
transition of the long alkyl chains.

Meanwhile, the C (1s) peak
in the XPS spectra of the PAE photocatalyst
can be deconvoluted into two peaks, accounted for sp2 and
sp (C≡C) hybridized carbons at 284.1 and 285.9 eV, respectively
(Figure S14). No surface oxygen-containing
groups are evident in the C 1s peak, validating the vacancy of oxidized
carbons in backbones. Overall, the Eg for 4a–4e ranges from 2.56 to 3.42 eV (Table 3).

Raman spectra as a
sensitive technique is used to investigate the
uniformity and quality of the PAE-based polymer 4c. As
exhibited in Figure S15, the peak at 1520
cm–1 coincides with the stretching vibration of
sp2 carbon domains in the aromatic rings. The peak at 2190
cm–1 can be attributed to the stretching vibration
of conjugated alkyne links. As shown in the Raman spectrum, two dominant
peaks appeared at 1605 and 1360 cm–1, belonging
to G- and D-band in the PAE system, respectively. That is, it contains
abundant BTz rings from 4c and edges and defects of PAE.
Besides, peaks at around 2610 cm–1 are attributed
to N in zinc nitron bond of sample 4c that coordinate
with zinc ions.
