In
the recent times, multifunctional materials have attracted immense
interest. Self-healing polymers are in great demand in almost every
coating application. With an increase in electromagnetic (EM) pollution,
curbing the same has become an urgent necessity. Lightweight coatings
and conducting polymeric materials are being highly researched upon
in this regard, and combining these properties with self-healing systems
would open new avenues in EM interference (EMI) shielding (specifically
in the microwave frequency domain) applications. In the current study,
a novel approach toward the development of microwave shielding materials
capable of self-healing through microwave heating has been attempted.
A covalently cross-linked material was developed using Diels–Alder
(DA) chemistry, which shows self-healing properties when stimulated
by heating. Herein, reduced graphene oxide grafted with magnetite
nanoparticles (rGO/Fe3O4) was covalently cross-linked
to thermoplastic polyurethane using DA chemistry. The addition of
multiwalled carbon nanotubes into these nanocomposites led to exceptional
EM wave shielding and self-healing properties through a synergistic
effect. The synergism led to exceptional EMI shielding of −36
dB, primarily through absorption in the microwave region of the EM
spectrum. When used in the form of thin coatings of about 1 mm in
thickness, the shielding value reached −28 dB, manifesting
in more than 99% attenuation of EM waves through absorption. The material
was also found to be capable of healing scratches or cuts through
microwave irradiation.

Introduction
The recent advancements
in science and technology have led to pervasive
use of electronic devices which emit electromagnetic (EM) radiations
as their byproduct. The miniaturization of devices has led to various
electric circuitries in a particular device to be placed in close
proximity to each other. This invites its own repercussions, leading
to interference among these devices causing device malfunctioning.
This not only compromises the proper functioning of the devices but
also has an adverse effect on human health.1−3 Therefore, extensive
research is being carried out to curb this menace of EM interference
(EMI).

EMI can be prevented either by reducing the emission
at the source
or by immunizing the victim device. The immunization of the victim
device is generally achieved by using EMI filters that are local devices
used to protect limited number of sensitive elements. Filters pose
certain disadvantages, one of which is that they only screen out conducted
emissions having characteristics different from that of the device
being protected. Therefore, to protect a device from interferences
from a broad spectrum of EM waves, there is a pressing need to develop
EMI shields. The basic requirements for a shield are good electrical
conductivity to reflect EM waves, good magnetic permeability, and
the presence of electric and magnetic dipoles to interact with the
incoming EM waves and absorb them.

Metals, despite being the
most prominent choice as shields, pose
several drawbacks such as high density, cumbersome process ability,
and poor corrosion resistance. Moreover, there is a demand for flexible
and easily moldable materials, which has led to polymer nanocomposites
becoming as emerging choices for shielding materials. Polymers are
exceptional in the sense that they can be easily customized as per
the requirement by adding certain fillers which impart EM shielding
properties. Carbonaceous fillers such as carbon black, graphite, graphene,
multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs), carbon fibers, and so forth
are highly conducting in nature and can be dispersed in polymer matrices
with the ease to develop an EMI shield. Carbonaceous fillers, being
electrically conducting in nature, predominantly screen EM waves by
reflection, which is not desirable. However, these fillers when used
in conjugation with magnetic nanoparticles help in multiple scattering
and absorption of EM waves. MWNTs and graphene derivatives are emerging
choices because of their high aspect ratios and skin effect which
leads to a high-frequency bandwidth.4−9

Graphene oxide (GO) is a versatile material that hosts a large
number of functional groups which can be used to graft magnetic particles
so that multifunctional materials can be developed for EMI shielding
applications. GO is nonconducting in nature, but it can be made conducting
by reducing it, forming reduced GO (rGO) which is partially conducting.
The planar structure of graphene sheets makes them the ideal choices
to graft nanoparticles, thus reducing the percolation concentration
of nanoparticles. Grafting of magnetic nanoparticles such as Co, Fe3O4, and Ni or dielectric nanoparticles such as
BaTiO3 and MnO2 on rGO sheets helps to improve
microwave absorption due to enhanced charge transport and enhanced
polarization losses.10−12 In the light of the above-mentioned facts, we have
attempted to conjugate rGO with magnetite nanoparticles using a facile,
one-pot approach, solvothermal route. The magnetic nature of these
heterostructures when combined with the high conductivity and aspect
ratio of MWNTs and dispersed in a polymer matrix helps to develop
an excellent EMI shielding material.13−21

In an attempt to develop multifunctional materials with more
than
just one application, we have developed a self-healable EMI shield.22−32 Self-healable materials are of great interest in this context because
the EMI shields may be in the form of coatings which on being scratched
can again recover through heating, without losing its shielding properties.
These multifunctional materials were developed by cross-linking nanoparticles
with the polymer matrix using Diels–Alder (DA) chemistry.33−37 The nanocomposites developed in this study can be used in the form
of thin self-healable coatings for EMI shielding applications. The
proposed work represents a novel approach because there is no literature
available on EMI shielding materials that are self-healable.

Characterizations
To characterize the nanoparticles, transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) images were acquired using TEM-Titan Themis at 300 kV. The structural
properties of the nanoparticles were analyzed using an X’pert
Pro X-ray diffractometer using a Cu Kα source. The Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectra of the samples were recorded using PerkinElmer
GX in the range of 4000–650 cm–1, in the
ATR mode. The defect characterization of nanoparticles was carried
out using a HORIBA LabRAM HR Raman spectrometer. The elemental state
of nanoparticles was characterized by an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer
(AXIS Ultra) using an Al monochromatic source (1.486 keV). The room-temperature
electrical conductivity of the samples was measured on 10 mm compression
molded discs using a TA Discovery HR-3 rheometer using a dielectric
setup connected to an LCR meter in the frequency range of 20 Hz to
2 MHz. The EMI shielding properties of the as-prepared samples were
studied in the X- and Ku-band frequency range using an Anritsu MS4642A
vector network analyzer (VNA) using a coax (Damaskos M07T) setup on
5.8 mm thick toroidal specimens, obtained by compression molding.
The samples had an outer diameter of 7 mm and inner diameter of 3
mm. The shielding effectiveness (SE) for thin films was measured on
a 1 mm thin film using a Keykom waveguide. The healing ability of
the nanocomposites was imaged using a ZEISS ULTRA 55 field emission
scanning electron microscope with an accelerating voltage of 5 kV.

Results
and Discussion
Characterization of rGO/Fe3O4, Furfuryl-Modified
rGO/Fe3O4, and Furfuryl-Functionalized Polyurethane
Figure 1a represents
the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern for neat GO and as-synthesised
rGO/Fe3O4 nanoparticles. Neat GO shows its characteristic
peak at 2θ = 10.5°, corresponding to its (001) reflection.
After solvothermal functionalization of GO sheets with Fe3O4 nanoparticles, six new peaks at 30.4°, 35.7°,
43.4°, 53.7°, 57.4°, and 62.8° can be observed,
which corresponds to the (200), (311), (400), (422), (511), and (440)
reflections of a cubic spinel structure of pure Fe3O4, respectively (JCPDS no. 19-0629).38 Apart from the characteristic reflections of Fe3O4, two broad peaks at 14.3° and 25.4° can be seen,
which corresponds to that of the partially reduced GO.39 Therefore, it can be said that the complete
reduction of GO was prevented so that some functional groups can be
made available for the functionalization of furfuryl amine (FA) onto
GO.

GO sheets. (j) AFM image of rGO/Fe3O4. (k) XPS
survey spectra of rGO/Fe3O4 along with C 1s
and Fe 2p spectra in the inset.

The morphology of rGO/Fe3O4 nanoparticles
was studied using TEM, as shown in Figure 1b. From the image, it can be seen that small
Fe3O4 nanoparticles of about 5–10 nm
size are dispersed uniformly over the GO sheet. The corresponding
selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern clearly indicates
the polycrystalline nature of these nanoparticles.40

The structural changes in the graphitic structure
of GO before
and after functionalization with Fe3O4 nanoparticles
were studied using Raman spectroscopy. The ID/IG ratio of neat GO and rGO/Fe3O4 was found to be 1.07 and 1.70, respectively,
as shown in Figure 1c. This shows that the defect concentration increased after solvothermal
functionalization because of unpaired defects arising out of the removal
of oxygen functional groups.

To determine the successful functionalization
of rGO/Fe3O4 with FA, FTIR spectra were analyzed,
as shown in Figure 1d. In the spectrum
of rGO/Fe3O4, it can be seen that GO was not
completely reduced by the solvothermal process. There are still some
functional groups left, such as the peaks at 3220 and 1024 cm–1, corresponding to −OH– and −C–O–
stretching vibrations of GO. In the spectrum of rGO/Fe3O4–FA, the peak at 3378 cm–1 and
also the increase in peak broadness due to overlap of −NH–
and −OH– stretching vibrations as compared to the spectrum
of rGO/Fe3O4 shows the presence of the −NH–
group from FA. The peaks at 1404 and 1336 cm–1 can
be assigned to furfuryl, and the peak at 1050 cm–1 can be assigned to −C–O–C– of the furfuryl
moiety of FA.41

The successful completion
of the DA reaction and formation of self-healable
structures was characterized using the corresponding FTIR spectrum.
In the spectrum of PU-SH, the peaks at 1773 and 1708 cm–1 correspond to the C=C stretching of the DA adduct and the
C=O stretching vibration of N,N′-(4,4′-diphenylmethane)bismaleimide (BMI), respectively.
Additionally, the peak at 750 cm–1 for the furfuryl
moiety of furfuryl-functionalized polyurethane (PU-FA) disappeared
in the spectrum of PU-SH, which again confirms the successful formation
of the DA adduct.

Figure 1f,g shows
the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrograph and the corresponding
energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDAX) mapping of the rGO/Fe3O4 nanoparticles. The percentage of Fe3O4 nanoparticles reduced onto rGO sheets was found to be 38%. Figure 1h shows the corresponding
EDAX mapping of elemental Fe on the rGO sheets. It can be seen that
Fe is distributed uniformly onto rGO sheets.

Figure 1i,j shows
the atomic force microscopy (AFM) topographic images of neat GO and
rGO/Fe3O4 nanoparticles, respectively. It can
be observed that neat GO sheets are quite large in their lateral dimension.
However, rGO/Fe3O4 nanoparticles on the other
hand are comparatively smaller in their lateral dimension because
of the high-temperature solvothermal treatment. The height of the
neat GO sheet was measured to be about 10 nm, due to overlapping of
GO sheets, whereas the height of the rGO/Fe3O4 sheets was measured to be about 30 nm. The increase in height may
be due to grafting of Fe3O4 nanoparticles onto
GO sheets.

To further confirm the grafting of Fe3O4 nanoparticles
onto the rGO sheets, XPS spectra were analyzed. From Figure 1i, the XPS survey spectra show
the presence of C 1s, O 1s, and Fe 2p peaks at ∼284, 529, and
710 eV, respectively. In the C 1s spectra (shown in the inset), three
distinctive peaks at 284.7, 285.5, and 288.6 eV corresponding to C=C,
C=O, and O–C=O functional groups, respectively,
in GO can be realized. Similarly, in the Fe 2p spectra (shown in the
inset), two distinctive peaks at 710.9 and 724.6 eV characteristic
of Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2, respectively, of Fe3O4 nanoparticles were realized. The absence of
any peak at 719.9 eV confirms the absence of any traces of Fe2O3.42,43

AC Electrical Conductivity
of Nanocomposites
It is
envisioned that conductivity is one of the key factors that can enhance
the EM wave shielding property of a material. Although conductivity
is not the only the criterion for effective EMI shielding, EM wave
attenuation can be escalated because of the well-connected MWNT network.
MWNTs facilitate charge transport in a well-connected network either
by hopping or by tunneling. Intertube distance plays a key role in
the conductivity of MWNT-based nanocomposites. Intertube distance
can be minimized by increasing the MWNT concentration, which facilitates
charge transport through tunneling. In Figure 2a, it can be seen that MWNTs can percolate
in the thermoplastic polyurethane matrix at a concentration of as
low as 0.5 wt %. At higher loadings of the MWNT, the MWNTs can percolate
very well and form effective charge transport networks. In Figure 2b, it can be seen
that, when only 5 wt % rGO/Fe3O4–FA was
added to PU-SH, the conductivity achieved is quite low. This can be
attributed to lower conductivity of rGO compared to MWNTs. When both
MWNTs and rGO/Fe3O4–FA were added together,
an improvement in conductivity was again noticed. This can be perceived
as an amplification in charge tunneling ability because of the presence
of semiconducting MWNTs and partially conducting rGO sheets. The universal
power law fitting onto frequency-dependent AC conductivity curves
reveals the equivalent number of resistors and capacitive network
taking part in the charge transport mechanism of these nanocomposites44 1  

Figure 2 AC electrical conductivity for nanocomposites.

The value of the exponent “s” gives
an indication of the extent of charge transfer that is taking place
through tunneling. In Figure 2, a value of above 0.75 was achieved for the exponent “s”, which indicates 25 and 75% equivalent network
of capacitors and resistances, respectively, for both PU-SH/3 wt %
MWNT and PU-SH/3 wt % MWNT/5 wt % rGO/Fe3O4–FA.
Capacitive networks create virtual connections between MWNTs at high
frequencies, due to intertube polarization, thereby leading to amplification
of conductivity at high frequencies, where DC conductivity has not
yet reached.45

Microwave Shielding Ability
of Nanocomposites
The EMI
shielding efficiency of a material is quantified as the ratio of the
intensities of the incident wave to that of the transmitted wave.
The attenuation of the incident EM wave is manifested as the total
SE (SET) and is expressed in decibels (dB). The total SE
is a culmination of the contributions from shielding due to three
different scattering mechanisms, namely, reflection from the rear
surface of the shield, attenuation by absorption as the wave passes
through the shield, and multiple reflections, which is neglected because
it occurs only in materials with thickness less than its skin depth
and whatever wave is reflected from the inner surface of the shield
will eventually get absorbed. It is apparent that shielding by absorption
is always the most preferred mechanism of shielding. Shielding by
absorption is brought about by the magnetic and electric dipoles in
the shield that can interact with the magnetic and electric fields,
respectively, of the incident EM wave.

In a two-port VNA, SE
is measured in terms of various scattering parameters (S11, S22, S12, and S21); therefore46 2   3   4  

Figure 3a represents
the total SE of nanocomposite samples of about 5.8 mm in thickness.
Because SE scales with MWNT concentration, with only 3 wt % loading
of conducting MWNTs, a SET of −27 dB was achieved
at 18 GHz. MWNTs help in attenuating EM waves not only because of
its conducting nature but also because they promote Ohmic losses through
charge transport.3 EMI shielding is enhanced
by a very well-connected MWNT network. With the increase in the MWNT
concentration, multiple scattering occurs within the various overlapping
MWNT interfaces and eventually attenuation of the EM waves takes place
because of their large specific area. This causes the EM wave shielding
by MWNTs to be manifested as absorption. Absorption in the intrinsically
conducting and nonmagnetic MWNTs may also be caused because of the
presence of defects and intertube polarization (electric dipoles).47

Figure 3 Total SE (SET) for (a) 5.8 mm thick toroidal
samples
and (b) 1 mm thick films.

When 5 wt % of rGO/Fe3O4–FA
was introduced,
it was realized that the SET diminished to a value of −4
dB at 18 GHz. Therefore, it can be said that rGO/Fe3O4–FA alone is ineffective in attenuating EM waves because
of its poor conductivity and inefficient charge transfer. However,
when a 3 wt % MWNT was introduced along with 5 wt % of rGO/Fe3O4–FA, a synergistic effect was realized.
The SET, increased to −36.7 dB at 18 GHz. This observed
synergism was due to the nanoscopic nature of MWNTs and rGO/Fe3O4, leading to interparticle scattering and absorption.
The presence of heterogeneities and macroscopic boundaries in the
shield leads to nomadic charge transfer and charge trapping, thereby
promoting EM wave absorption.48

Figure 3b represents
the SET of 1 mm thin nanocomposite films. It was realized
that even at such small thickness of the shield, the EM wave shielding
of above 95% (SET of −15 dB) was achieved with only
3 wt % MWNTs. When both MWNTs and rGO/Fe3O4–FA
were added, attenuation of above 99.7%, that is, SET of
−28 dB was achieved. Therefore, the proposed shield can be
very well used as an effective EM wave absorber and a self-healable
coating.

Underlying Mechanism of Microwave Shielding of Nanocomposites
In a two-port VNA, the different S-parameters
generated help to determine the contribution of absorption and reflection
toward the total SE. The SE due to reflection and absorption has been
represented in Figure 4a,b, respectively. As mentioned earlier, when it comes to the mechanism
of shielding by MWNTs, a small portion of the EM wave gets reflected
at the front surface of the shield, but because of enhanced charge
transport taking place in the MWNTs, the wave gets attenuated as it
passes through the shield by multiple scattering and ohmic losses,
which is interpreted by the VNA as absorption. In the case of nanocomposites,
3 wt % MWNTs, SER is about −1.5 dB and SEA is −25.5 dB. This proves that in a well-percolated MWNT network,
absorption is the predominant mechanism of shielding. Nanocomposites
containing only rGO/Fe3O4 show SER of only −0.1 dB and the corresponding SEA show
−3.9 dB. This absorption may come from the magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles which interact with the magnetic
component of the EM wave, causing attenuation, from the interconnected
rGO network which is slightly conducting causing multiple scattering
or due to the charge accumulation at the heterojunctions and interfaces.

Figure 4 SE due
to (a) reflection (SER) and (b) absorption (SEA) for 5.8 mm thick toroidal samples.

As was discussed earlier, a combination of MWNTs and rGO/Fe3O4 leads to a synergistic effect which helps in
attenuating EM waves by absorption through better impedance matching.
From Figure 4, it can
be realized that the synergism leads to enhanced EM wave absorption
of about −35.4 dB and diminished reflection of only −1.3
dB.

From the above discussion, it can be concluded that the
synergism
achieved by loading both MWNTs and rGO/Fe3O4 is desirable to achieve the maximum possible EM wave absorption.49,50 The mechanism of shielding can be further analyzed using complex
microwave properties such as complex permeability and permittivity.
These properties have been discussed in detail in the Supporting Information.

Microwave-Healing Ability
of Nanocomposites
The microwave
shielding nanocomposites developed in the current study were fabricated
such that these materials could be used as self-healable coatings
for electronic applications. As discussed earlier, furfuryl-linked
rGO/Fe3O4 (rGO/Fe3O4–FA)
and PU (PU-FA) were covalently cross-linked using BMI through the
DA chemistry. This resulted in nanocomposites with self-healing properties
using microwaves. The proposed material apart from being an excellent
EMI shielding material also works as a self-healing material because
of its microwave absorbing nature. The self-healing ability is triggered
by the heat generated in the material as a result of microwave absorption.
The absorbed microwave is dissipated across the material in the form
of heat.

To demonstrate the self-healing ability of these nanocomposites,
samples were made by molding the samples into thin films by compression
molding. The film was then cut into two halves and then joined together
with slight pressure. As shown in Figure 5a, a cut was made on the film. The joined
film was allowed to heal by exposing it to waves from a domestic microwave
having a wattage of 900 W for 10 min. After 10 min, the sample was
removed from the microwave and observed under a microscope. As shown
in Figure 5b, the cut
healed completely. As opposed to the conventional hot-air oven, where
healing of the cracks may take up to 24 h, healing using a microwave
is a much faster and efficient process.51

Figure 5 SEM
images for self-healing tests on molded samples showing (a)
cut sample and (b) healed cut after heating in a microwave oven.

The mechanism of healing has been
represented schematically in Scheme 1. The healing of
the cut was brought about by the recombination of furan and maleimide
groups to form the DA adduct. The DA bond being much weaker compared
to other types of covalent bonds can break because of stretching or
scratching of these bonds.41,51 When the cut is heated
using microwaves, the heat generated due to the absorption of microwaves
by the microwave absorbers in the sample leads to fusing and recombination
of these bonds, thereby healing the cut.

Conclusions
The
current study was focused on developing self-healable EMI shielding
materials. The nanocomposites developed by cross-linking furfuryl-functionalized
rGO/Fe3O4 with furfuryl-functionalized PU using
BMI and DA chemistry showed self-healing properties when heated using
microwave irradiation. The microwave absorbers in the nanocomposite
helped in absorbing most of the incoming microwave radiations, and
this manifested in exceptional microwave shielding properties. The
material when used in the form of 1 mm thin coatings/films provided
above 99% microwave screening ability. Substantially, this current
work not only verifies the microwave shielding ability of the developed
nanocomposites but also verifies that the absorbed microwave when
dissipated as heat can be used to heal cuts and scratches in the material.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Polyethylene glycol (PEG, Mn = 4000 g mol–1) was procured from
Merck. 4,4-Diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI, 99%), FA, and (BMI)
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Pristine MWNTs were purchased from
Nanocyl. GO was purchased from BT Corp. Other chemicals and solvents
used were obtained from commercial sources.

Preparation of rGO/Fe3O4 Nanoparticles
by the Solvothermal Method
The reduction of magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles onto rGO sheets was achieved using
a one-pot solvothermal method.52 In a typical
procedure, 100 mg of GO was first dispersed in 30 mL ethylene glycol
(EG), by probe and bath sonication. 200 mg of FeCl3·6H2O was dissolved in 10 mL of EG. To this solution, predetermined
amount of urea was added and dissolved under magnetic stirring. The
as-prepared GO solution was added subsequently to the above solution
followed by stirring for 20 min. To this solution, 2 mL of hydrazine
hydrate was added and stirred for another 20 min. This solution was
transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave, and solvothermal reduction
was carried out at 180 °C for 10 h. After that, the solution
was allowed to cool to room temperature, and rGO/Fe3O4 was magnetically separated and washed thoroughly with ethanol,
followed by drying at 60 °C for 12 h.

Synthesis of FA-Modified
rGO/Fe3O4 (rGO/Fe3O4–FA)
Nanoparticles
As shown in Scheme 2, 100 mg of rGO/Fe3O4 was dispersed in 100 mL water. pH was adjusted
to 1 by adding few drops of HCl. Then, 1 g of FA was added, and the
reaction was carried out at 80 °C for 12 h. The obtained product
was washed thoroughly with water to remove redundant HCl and unreacted
FA and dried under vacuum at 60 °C for 12 h.41

Scheme 2 Synthesis of rGO/Fe3O4–FA
Synthesis of PU-FA
PU-FA was synthesized by a two-step
process.51 The first step is the synthesis
of PU. In a typical process, 1 mol PEG and 2 mol MDI were dissolved
in dimethylformamide (DMF) separately. The two solutions were mixed
together and stirred at room temperature for 1 h. The temperature
was then increased to 80 °C, and the reaction was carried out
for 4 h under nitrogen atmosphere. To this solution, 1 mL of FA was
added, and the reaction was carried out for another 4 h. The obtained
solution was dried first in air and then under vacuum at 80 °C
for 24 h (Scheme 3).

Shielding Self-Healing PU Nanocomposites
Self-healable PU
nanocomposites, capable of microwave shielding,
was fabricated by adding 5 wt % of rGO/Fe3O4–FA to the PU-FA solution in DMF followed by bath sonication
for 30 min. The solution was subjected to mechanical mixing along
with sonication for 2 h. To this solution, 1 g of BMI was added, and
mechanical stirring was continued at 65 °C for 3 h. To further
improve the EMI shielding performance of these nanocomposites, 3 wt
% MWNTs was added to these nanocomposites. The solution was then poured
into a Teflon-lined Petri plate and dried in air for 24 h followed
by vacuum drying for 48 h. Unfilled self-healable PU (PU-SH), PU-SH
with 3 wt % MWNT and PU-SH with 5 wt % rGO/Fe3O4–FA was prepared as per the above protocol as control samples.
