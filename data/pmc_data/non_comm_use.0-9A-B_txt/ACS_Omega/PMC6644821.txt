We first fabricated holographic polymer-dispersed
liquid crystals
(HPDLCs) that produce multiple Bragg diffractions with different polarization
states for every angle of incidence, through a photopolymerization-induced
phase separation by one-time interferential exposure. The polarizations
of the Bragg diffractions were well-controlled at individual wavelengths
in the fabrication process by the compositional ratio of LCs to monomers.
The raw mixtures of extremely low-functionality monomers having very
different viscosities were used to reduce the domain size in phase
separation and subsequently to form elaborate periodic structures
of the LC and polymer phases. A cross-linker (1-vinyl-2-pyrrolidione)
and a prepolymer with urethane groups were employed to strengthen
the polymer network. Note that the diffractions of our HPDLCs are
regarded as not purely but mostly Bragg type, according to the evaluation
with the established criteria. The devices, which are monolithic but
versatile in diffractive behaviors, have advantages of simple manufacturing
and handling.

1 Introduction
A versatile diffractive
device that allows us to efficiently steer
multiple light waves is useful in various areas ranging from all-purpose
optical elements to cutting-edge photonic applications. From the point
of view of manufacturing, this device should have a simple fabrication
procedure and moreover an integrated but monolithic durable structure.
These constraints on the device properties do not conflict but can
be realized with holographic polymer-dispersed liquid crystals (HPDLCs).
Conventional HPDLCs have produced only a single Bragg diffraction
regulated by a simple periodic structure. However, our HPDLCs are
capable of displaying multiple Bragg diffractions with different wavelength
and polarization properties for every angle of incidence. These HPDLCs
are made with a single interferential exposure while only adjusting
fabrication conditions (liquid crystal/monomer mixture ratio and exposure
temperature) and selecting appropriate raw materials to control the
phase separation morphology and orientation-ordering distribution.
These diffractive structures were formed through photopolymerization-induced
phase separation (PPIPS) developed by interferential exposure to the
prescribed raw materials. Thus, the devices with the HPDLCs are expandable
to a wide range of fundamental and advanced optical (photonic) applications.
For instance, the devices possess an integrated monolithic structure
and allow us to unite optical pickup components of multiformat disk
drives, which separate and combine several light beams with different
wavelengths.1,2 Such multiple periodic structures
have a potential for applications to optical nonlinear resonators
and distributed Bragg reflector or distributed feedback lasers.3−5

Generally, HPDLCs are made of regularly arranged double-phase
structures
with mesoscale (submicrometer- to micrometer-scale) domains. LC molecules
aggregate to form discrete or coalesced droplets that are periodically
distributed in polymer networks on the scale of optical wavelengths.
An essential property of HPDLCs is the ability to produce Bragg diffraction
with a strong optical polarization, resulting from the orientation
ordering of the LC molecules in the droplets. Coupled wave theory,
an established general theoretical framework for analyzing thick optical
gratings first described by Kogelnik, is based on scalar wave equations
in electromagnetic wave optics.6,7 Two-wave coupled wave
theory, an extension of the Kogelnik’s theory developed for
analyzing particularly thick HPDLC gratings,8−11 accounts accurately for the individual
p- and s-polarization components in the Bragg diffractions, that is,
the polarizations parallel and perpendicular to the plane containing
the incident and diffracted rays, respectively.12,13

HPDLCs can be formed through PPIPS, achieved by a spatially
periodic
intensity modulation during holographic or interferential exposure.
Linearly polarized Bragg diffraction is produced by the orientation
ordering of LC molecules, which is uniaxial along the grating vector
and can be switched by applying an electric field. Following the demonstration
of switching the polarization states in the diffraction by Sutherland,14 Boiko et al. developed an electrically controlled
four-state switch using orthogonal polarized diffractions by combining
two HPDLCs with a polarization rotator.15 Lu et al. produced a polarization beam splitter that can precisely
switch between states with orthogonal polarizations using an electric
field.16 This polarization switchability
has given rise to many fundamental and pioneering photonic applications,
such as photonic crystals, tunable wavelength lasers, tunable focal
length lenses, and all-optical switches using azo-benzene dyes.17−23 Recently, HPCLCs with fine and complex structures were fabricated
using elaborate techniques of holographic exposure such as multibeam,
multiple, or nonlinear irradiation.24−27 For instance, reflective HPDLC
gratings with a half pitch equal to the interferential fringe spacing
have been fabricated through PPIPS by holographic exposure using a
femtosecond laser and a two-photon absorptive dye.27 Future HPDLCs will soon be required to display more complex
and finer structures. Furthermore, a simplification of fabrication
processes will make devices readily applicable to practical use.

The processes of localized aggregation and uniaxial orientation
ordering of LC molecules during PPIPS have been reliably investigated
using Fourier transformation infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and
dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements.28−32 Real-time FTIR spectroscopy and photo-DSC, which
are useful for tracking processes of LC orientation ordering and acrylate
polymerization, revealed the role of monomer functionality in structural
formation during PPIPS.33,34 NMR and DLS measurements
provided information on the diffusion and orientation-ordering behaviors
of LC molecules constrained during PPIPS, in particular, the anchoring
effect at the LC/polymer interfaces and the diffusion rates influenced
by the LC/monomer compositional ratio.

The orientation-ordering
dynamics of LC molecules during PPIPS
was explained by diffusion theory including polymerization reactions35−37 and by the thermodynamics of spatiotemporal fluctuations within
LC/monomer mixtures.38−41 Because the photopolymerization rate depends on the (sinusoidal-distributed)
irradiation intensity during interferential exposure, inhomogeneous
polymerization is the driving force to segregate monomers and LCs
and consequently to order the orientation of LC molecules. The diffusion
coefficient of monomers depends on their molecular weight and reactivity.
Therefore, a variety of monomer molecular weights or functional numbers
yield the complex distribution of polymer and LC phases. For instance,
a simulated mixture of LC and prepolymer with tri- and hexa-functionalities
displays a much more complex distribution than expected when using
sinusoidal intensity in interferential exposure because of the difference
in diffusion coefficients between tri- and hexa-functional oligomers.36 The formation of LC droplet distribution and
the orientation orderings of LC molecules during PPIPS were theoretically
explained in terms of the free energy of liquid–liquid (de-)mixing,
molecular orientation ordering, and polymer network elasticity. For
instance, the inhomogeneous aggregation that produces discrete LC
droplets with orientation ordering was numerically reproduced using
the time-dependent Ginzburg–Landau model combined with Flory–Huggins
and Maier–Saupe theories, assuming Gaussian-type cross-linked
polymer chains.40−43

The shape of LC droplets and the molecular orientation within
them
are generally dominated by the temperature, LC/monomer compositional
ratio, and polymer network density.44−47 Boots and Serbutoviez et al.
theoretically and experimentally studied droplet morphology during
PPIPS under spatially uniform irradiation and reported that the shape
and size are influenced by the cross-linking density of the polymer
network surrounding the droplets.38,41 The LC droplet
size decreases in a loose network because LC molecules permeate the
polymer network easily. Pogue et al. adjusted the monomer functional
number from 2 to 5 and observed the LC droplet morphology. Their statistical
analysis revealed the dependence of the LC droplet size, shape, or
distribution on the monomer functionality.48 The influence of the monomer functional number on the LC droplet
size was examined to improve the diffraction efficiency.49 This efficiency was maximized for a monomer
functional number of approximately 1.5 because the phase separation
morphology yielded a smooth sinusoidal periodic structure that could
reduce light scattering. Because smaller LC droplets may produce more
elaborate structures in phase separation and suppress residual light
scattering, we reduced the LC droplet size by using monomer (prepolymer)
mixtures with low functional numbers as low as 1 or 2. However, phase
separation may fail to occur with such low-functionality monomers,
as previous studies suggested that the elasticity in a low-dimensionality
polymer network may be insufficient to segregate LC molecules.48 We therefore used a prepolymer containing urethane
groups to strengthen the polymer networks.50−52 A mixture of
monomers (prepolymer) with a wide viscosity range was used. Such a
monomer system is expected to diffuse at different rates and, consequently,
to polymerize into complicated periodic structures as a result of
interferential irradiation. Furthermore, a small amount of 1-vinyl-2-pyrrolidione
(NVP) was added because it generally fulfills three purposes: first,
as a diluent to homogenize the monomer mixture; second, as a cross-linker
in the polymer network; and third, as an agent to reduce LC droplets.34,53

2 Results
The diffraction efficiency spectrum
was measured for different
angles of incidence. Each spectrum displayed either a single peak
or plural peaks, of which the intensity and wavelength varied as a
function of the angle of incidence.54 Characteristic
results, measured at 25 °C, are plotted for the samples with X = 56 mol % and Tex = 25 °C
(Figure 1) and X = 50 mol % and Tex = 55 °C
(Figure 2), as a function
of the wavelength λ and the angle of incidence θ, where X is the molar ratio of LC to the raw mixture and Tex is the exposure temperature, as detailed
in section 2.3.
The vertical bars in the graphs denote the diffraction efficiencies
for the p- and s-polarizations, ηp and ηs. The broken curves in the λ–θ plane represent
the theoretical estimates of the Bragg formula for a periodic structure
with a pitch of Λ/N, that is, λ = 2(Λ/N) sin θ, where Λ is the periodic interval of
the sinusoidal intensity fringes produced by the interferential irradiation
and N = 1, 2, 3, .... The value of Λ was determined
to be 1.03 ± 0.03 μm from optical microscopy as detailed
below. The measured diffraction efficiencies satisfy the Bragg formula
for either N.

Figure 1 Diffraction efficiencies measured with
a polarizer set for (a)
p- and (b) s-polarization directions for the samples prepared with X = 56 mol % and Tex = 25 °C.
The vertical bars denote the diffraction efficiencies. The broken
curves in the θ–λ plane indicate the Bragg formula
predictions for N, as explained in the text. The
numerals neighboring the bars indicate diffraction efficiencies.

Figure 2 Bragg diffraction efficiencies measured with
a polarizer set for
(a) p- and (b) s-polarization directions for the samples prepared
with X = 50 mol % and Tex = 55 °C. The features are as described in Figure 1.

For N = 1, ηp is large
and satisfies
the Bragg formula over a wide range of θ, as represented by
the data located on the curves (N = 1) in Figures 1a and 2a. On the other hand, ηs is approximately
zero over the θ–λ plane, as shown by the data on
the curves (N = 1) in Figures 1b and 2b. For N = 2, ηp and ηs are essentially
zero, as shown by the data on the curves (N = 2)
in Figure 1a,b, but
have nonzero values over a wide range of θ when the sample was
prepared with another condition, as shown by the data on the curves
(N = 2) in Figure 2a,b. Some diffraction is also apparent along the curves,
corresponding to N ≥ 3, for all the samples
prepared. We examined a thicker sample, as shown in Figure 3a,b. The results are of an
optical grating of a thickness of 29 μm, which was prepared
with X = 56 mol % and Tex = 40 °C. The measured data display that ηp for N = 1 is mostly 90% and ηs for N = 2 is about 60%, and they depend strongly
on the polarization state.

Figure 3 Bragg diffraction efficiencies measured with
a polarizer set for
(a) p- and (b) s-polarization directions for the samples of a thickness
of 29 μm, which was prepared with X = 56 mol
% and Tex = 40 °C. The features are
as described in Figure 1.

We sampled the diffraction efficiencies
for N =
1 and 2 at θ = 30°, at wavelengths of approximately 1.0
and 0.5 μm, respectively. The diffraction property is generally
characterized by its polarization and magnitude. In this paper, the
diffraction polarization α is defined as α = (ηp – ηs)/(ηp + ηs) and equals −1, 0, or 1 when the diffraction is completely
s-polarized, nonpolarized, or p-polarized, respectively. The values
of α for N = 1 and 2 are mapped as a function
of X and Tex, as expressed
by the color scale in Figure 4a,b, respectively. The magnitude of the diffraction β
is defined as the maximum diffraction efficiency achieved by rotating
the polarization azimuth and is expressed by the contours superposed
on the same figures. As shown in Figure 4a, the diffraction for N = 1 retains p-polarization (α > 0) over a wide range of Tex and X, whereas β increases
as X increases. The increase of β is particularly
strong around X = 50 mol %, as indicated by the high
contour density. Figure 4b shows the diffraction for N = 2 changing from
p- to s-polarization as X increases. The transition
from green to red shows the polarization switching rapidly from the
p-state (α > 0) to the s-state (α < 0) as X increases past 50 mol %. This change appears significantly
at approximately Tex = 40 °C. These
rapid changes in β
for N = 1 and in α for N =
2 near X = 50 mol % are mostly independent of Tex.

Figure 4 Bragg diffraction efficiency for samples prepared
using low-functionality
monomers mapped as a function of the LC/monomer mixture ratio and
the exposure temperature. The data were measured for wavelengths λ
of (a) 1 μm and (b) 0.5 μm, with the angle of incidence
θ set to 30°, corresponding to N = 1 and
2, respectively. The color scale and contours represent, respectively,
the diffraction polarization α and magnitude β, as defined
in the text. The circle symbols represent measured points. The color
scale and contours were determined in the simplest way from the measurements,
that is, the linear interpolations between the measurements. The labels
I–IV indicate the measurement points discussed elsewhere in
this paper. The NI transition point of the LC material (35 °C)
is expressed as a broken white line.

The diffraction properties of the samples prepared with a
high-functionality
monomer or dipentaerythritol pentaacrylate (DPHPA) were examined in
comparison with the present low-functionality monomer system. The
values of α and β are mapped as a function of X and Tex, in the same way as Figure 4, for N = 1 and 2, respectively, as shown in Figure 5a,b. For N = 1, the values
of α and β are the largest at around X = 55–60 mol % and Tex below nematic-to-isotropic
(NI) transition temperature, which decrease monotonically as X or Tex deviates from there,
as shown in Figure 5a, whereas the values of α and β for the samples obtained
from low-functionality monomers remain large in the wide range of X and Tex, particularly even
at Tex higher than the NI transition point,
as shown in Figure 4a. For N = 2, as shown in Figure 5b, β reaches its maximum value of 0.06
at around X = 57 mol % and Tex = 40 °C, and α remains positive. On the other
hand, as shown in Figure 4b, β is averagely quite larger than that in Figure 5b, and X can control α well between negative and positive. The results
indicate that the samples made of high-functionality monomers produce
single diffraction only for N = 1 and suggest a microscopic
view that the periodic structure of phase separation forms sinusoidal
distribution of refractive index modulation.

Figure 5 Bragg diffraction efficiency
for samples prepared using a high-functionality
monomer (DPHPA) mapped as a function of the LC/monomer mixture ratio
and the exposure temperature. The data are shown in the same way as
in Figure 4. The labels
V and VI indicate the measurement points discussed elsewhere in this
paper.

Figure 6a,b shows
the diffraction efficiencies as a function of the polarization azimuth
for N = 1 and 2, respectively. The data refer to
four specific samples with different values of X at Tex = 40 °C, denoted I to IV in Figure 4. In Figure 6a, the diffraction polarization
for N = 1 remains in the p-state as X increases, whereas in Figure 6b, the diffraction for N = 2 changes from
p-polarization to nonpolarization and to s-polarization states, as
shown by samples I to IV. Figure 6c,d shows the diffraction efficiencies as a function
of the polarization azimuth for N = 1 and 2, respectively,
when samples I to IV were heated up and maintained at 70 °C.
The polarization properties of the HPDLCs were found to appear and
vanish reversibly at temperatures below and above the NI transition
point. This result ensures that the diffraction polarization is caused
by the LC orientation orderings that were inhomogeneously formed through
PPIPS in the interferential exposure.

Figure 6 Polarization azimuth dependence of the
diffraction efficiency for
samples I to IV, labeled in Figure 4. The results were obtained for wavelengths of (a)
λ = 1 μm and (b) λ = 0.5 μm and with an angle
of incidence θ = 30°, corresponding to N = 1 and 2, respectively. The data in (c) and (d) are the same, respectively,
as those in (a) and (b) but were measured at 70 °C, higher than
the NI transition point of the LC material (35 °C), where the
data for samples II to IV in (d) are magnified ten times to show them
in detail. Note that p- and s-polarizations correspond to 0°
(180°) and 90° (−90°) in polarization azimuth,
respectively.

The parameter S, which quantitates the orientation
ordering at 25 °C (i.e., a temperature below the NI transition
point of K15 (35 °C)), is mapped out as a function of Tex and X in Figure 7. S is very
close to zero near X = 33 mol %, regardless of Tex, and is consistent with the result shown
in Figure 4a,b. That
is, the diffraction property near 33 mol % for N =
1 and 2 is nonpolarized or nondiffracted. S increases
with increasing X initially, and much more steeply
as X passes 50 mol %, albeit with some local irregularities.

the LC in the HPDLCs, as a function of the LC/monomer mixture ratio
and the exposure temperature. Measurements were performed at 25 °C.
Samples I to IV refer to the labels in Figure 4. The circle symbols represent measured points.
The labels I–IV indicate the measurement points discussed elsewhere
in this paper. The values of S on the map were linearly
interpolated between the measurements. The NI transition point of
the LC material (35 °C) is expressed as a broken black line.

Microscopic optical anisotropy
in the periodic structures of samples
I to VI was observed when the grating vector was rotated to 45°
in the azimuth from the polarizing directions of the crossed-nicols
polarizers, as shown in Figure 8a–f. The inset photographs in Figure 8a–d were captured under the same exposure,
to allow a comparison of the average optical anisotropy between samples
I, II, III, and IV. The fringes are arranged along the direction of
the grating vector (arrow labeled p in the image). The pitch of 1.03
± 0.03 μm corresponds to the interferential interval of
the exposure. This indicates that anisotropic and isotropic phases
were formed with a spatial periodicity by PPIPS in the interferential
exposure and suggests that the LC molecules in the LC-rich phase are
ordered in their orientation along the grating vector, whereas the
polymer-rich phase is isotropic. The periodic contrasts increase with
increasing X, as shown in the insets. This result
is consistent with the increase in S as shown in Figure 6. Samples V and VI,
of which X is 57 mol %, revealed smooth and obvious
periodic contrasts within the image resolution, as shown in Figure 8e,f, in comparison
with the image of sample IV, of which X is nearly
the same.

Figure 8 Optical anisotropy in samples I to VI (see labels in Figures 4 and 5), imaged with a polarizing optical microscope, as shown in (a–f),
respectively. The insets are images of the corresponding samples that
were photographed at a fixed exposure. The cross lines indicate the
polarizer orientations in the crossed-nicols configuration. The length
of the cross lines defines the 1 μm scale. The arrows indicate
the p- and s-polarization directions.

Detailed morphological information on the phase separation
was
obtained by observing the cross sections of the polymer phase in samples
I to VI using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), after rinsing
out the LC phase. The resulting images are shown in Figure 9a–f and magnified in
the insets. The cross sections show the periodic variable clarity
along the direction of the grating vector (the arrow p in the image)
with a periodicity of 1 μm. These periodic layers can reasonably
be regarded as consisting of polymer- and LC-rich phases. In the sample
with a small X, for example, sample I, as shown in Figure 9a, the polymer pervades
most of the periodic structure, whereas the LC-rich phase is confined
to narrow layers. In samples II and III, as shown in Figure 9b,c, the polymer layers gradually
decrease, and the LC molecules most likely permeate the polymer phase
with increasing X. Then, in sample IV, as shown in Figure 9d, the porous network
of the polymer extends, incorporating the LC molecules to form the
mixed phases. On the other hand, as shown in Figure 9e,f, samples V and VI possess relatively
large holes locally confined in the grating layers, in comparison
with sample IV.

I to
VI (see labels in Figures 4 and 5), observed by SEM after rinsing
out the LC, as shown in (a–f), respectively. The insets show
magnified images. The scale bars correspond to 1 μm. The arrows
indicate the p- and s-polarization directions.

3 Discussion
In this study, the optical diffractions
measured here are regarded
as not purely but mostly Bragg diffraction because they are categorized
in the intermediate regime between Raman–Nath and Bragg types
but are close to the Bragg regime, according to the criteria proposed
by Moharam et al., as detailed below.55−57 They proposed two indicators
to evaluate the criteria of the diffraction type, that is, the terminology
of thin or thick grating, Q′ = 2πλd/naΛ2 cos θ′, and the modulation
parameter of the refractive index, γ = πΔnd/λ cos θ′. The values of Q′ and γ for our HPDLC gratings can be estimated to be
41.3 and 2.65, respectively. Note that the periodic pitch is Λ
= 1 μm, the thickness is d = 10 μm, the
average refractive index is na = 1.6,
the amplitude of refractive index modulation is Δn = 0.08, the optical wavelength is λ = 1 μm, and the
angle of incidence in the grating medium is θ′ = 18.2°,
estimated from the angle of incidence in air θ = 30° through
Snell’s law. According to the criteria, an optical diffraction
is categorized into the Raman–Nath regime if Q′γ < 1, in the Bragg regime if Q′/γ > 20, and in the intermediate regime if the other
cases. The values of Q′γ and Q′/γ for our HPDLCs are estimated to be about
109 and 15.6, respectively, from the above-mentioned parameters. Thus,
the diffractions are categorized into the intermediate regime but
far from the Raman–Nath regime and close to the Bragg regime.

The occurrence of multiple Bragg diffractions (N = 1, 2, ...) from the HPDLC with different wavelengths and polarizations
for every angle of incidence indicates that the grating possesses
a periodic nonsinusoidal modulation of the birefringent refractive
index. As shown in Figure 4, the diffraction behavior is rapidly altered around an LC/monomer
ratio value, X = 50 mol %. The orientation-ordering
parameter S also displays a marked change at the
same value, X = 50 mol %, as shown in Figure 7. These coincident changes
in diffraction polarization and LC orientation ordering at around
an LC/monomer ratio of 50 mol % suggest the existence of a critical
transformation of the LC molecular orientation surrounded by the polymer
network.

The cross-sectional views observed by SEM provide some
insights
into the phase separation structure that undergoes a transformation
in LC- and polymer-rich morphologies at around the critical ratio
(X = 50 mol %), as shown in Figure 9a–d. On the basis of the results that
the diffractions for all of N appear and vanish reversibly
by changing the temperature, as shown in Figure 6, the uniaxial orientation orderings are
most likely distributed periodically with different periodic pitches
Λ/N at N = 1, 2, .... This
complex periodic distribution of the orientation orderings is speculated
to result from LC molecular anchorings that occur at the interfaces
with the polymer phases.28,31,58,59 At small values of X, the LC molecules aggregate to form isolated droplets surrounded
by the polymer network, as shown in Figure 9a,b. These isolated droplets typically display
a point-symmetric shape. Therefore, optical anisotropy is not macroscopically
exhibited, although each droplet possesses orientation-ordered LC
molecules. For large X, the LC droplets coalesce
together in the porous polymer networks, as shown in Figure 9c,d. The two-beam interferential
exposure may uniaxially produce periodic phase separation along the
grating vector and anisotropic coalescent boundaries between the LC
molecules and the polymer networks. Consequently, the orientation
orderings formed by these anisotropic interfaces are considered to
appear macroscopically as optical anisotropy.

Various polarization-operated
diffractive switches composed of
these HPDLCs can be implemented using this one-time interferential
exposure, simply by controlling the preparation conditions. Our HPDLCs
allow us to control the diffraction intensity individually at different
wavelengths by the polarization state, and the devices can be grouped
into three types. The first type is an antisynchronous wavelength
selector, that is, the incident
light with a given wavelength is diffracted at the p-polarization
state and transmitted at the s-polarization state, whereas the incident
light with a given different wavelength is diffracted at the s-polarization
state and transmitted at the p-polarization state (sample IV, Figure 6a,b). The second
type is a synchronous wavelength selector, which switches the diffraction/transmission
states synchronously at two given different wavelengths by rotating
polarization azimuth (sample I, Figure 6a,b). The third type switches the diffraction/transmission
states of the incident light at a given wavelength depending on polarization
azimuth, whereas the light with a given different wavelength remains
diffracted regardless of the polarization state (nearly sample III, Figure 6a,b). These types
are adjustable in the fabrication process, as mentioned above. Furthermore,
the fabrication process could be integrated with other processes,
such as multibeam, multiple, or nonlinear irradiation, and potentially
produce advanced holographic structures.

4 Conclusions
In summary, we first produced HPDLCs displaying multiple Bragg
diffractions with different wavelengths and different polarizations
for every angle of incidence, following PPIPS by a single interferential
exposure. We have to note that, strictly speaking, our HPDLCs produce
not purely but mostly Bragg diffractions, based on the established
criteria. The polarization states of the diffraction were found to
be individually controlled from linear to nonpolarized states while
retaining a large diffraction efficiency, by carefully adjusting the
fabrication parameters and choosing fundamental properties of the
raw materials. The fabrication parameters that governed the nonsinusoidal
periodic structure of the phase separation were only the LC/monomer
compositional ratio and the exposure temperature. The extremely low
functionality of the used monomers reduced the domain size in the
phase separation. The mixture of plural types of monomers with different
viscosities was used, causing diffusion at different rates during
PPIPS to form elaborate periodic structures. A cross-linker (NVP)
and a prepolymer including urethane groups were employed to strengthen
the polymer network. This method is readily adaptable to other fabrication
techniques and has a potential for applications to various optical
(photonic) diffractive devices.

5.1 Mixture of Materials
A nematic LC,
4-cyano-4′-pentylbiphenyl (K15, Merck Corp., molecular weight Mw = 249.53, viscosity ηv =
30 mPa s (25 °C)), has refractive indices for ordinary and extraordinary
rays (no = 1.5331 and ne = 1.7288) and a NI transition point of 35 °C. K15
was mixed with a commercial prepolymer (AH600, Kyoeisha Chemical Co.,
Ltd., Mw = 612.7, ηv =
2000–4000 mPa s, and functionality f = 2)
that possesses urethane groups in 2-hydroxy 3-phenoxy propyl acrylate
(refractive index n = 1.5258) and hexamethylene diisocyanate
(n = 1.453). We mixed dimethylol tricyclo-decane
diacrylate (DCPA, Kyoeisha Chemical Co., Ltd., Mw = 304, ηv = 150 mPa s, n = 1.5034, and f = 2) and 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate
(HO, Kyoeisha Chemical Co., Ltd., Mw =
116.1, ηv = 6.5 mPa s, n = 1.453,
and f = 1) as monomers and NVP (Sigma-Aldrich Co.
LLC., Mw = 111.4, ηv =
2.5 mPa s, n = 1.512, and f = 1)
as a cross-linker. The corresponding ratios in the monomer mixtures
AH600, DCPA, HO, and NVP were 50, 22, 22, and 6 mol %, respectively.
The ratio of the LC and the monomer mixture was X:(100 – X), where X varied
from 33 to 59 mol %. An initiator, N-phenylglycine
(NPG, Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd., Mw = 151.2), and a sensitizer, dibromofluoroscein (DBF, Tokyo Chemical
Industry Co., Ltd., Mw = 490.1), were
then added to the mixture, in 0.1 and 0.1 wt %, respectively. The
whole mixture was stirred while increasing the temperature gradually
to 50 °C and was then confirmed to have dissolved uniformly after
cooling down to 20 °C.

In addition, samples were prepared
using a higher functionality monomer in the same way as aforementioned.
K15 was mixed with a monomer DPHPA (mixture of tetra-, penta-, and
hexa-acrylate) (Polysciences, Inc., Mw = 524.5, n = 1.490, f ≈
5). The corresponding ratios in the monomer mixtures DPHPA and NVP
were 94 and 6 mol %, respectively. The ratio of the LC and the monomer
mixture was X:(100 – X),
where X varied from 44 to 70 mol %. NPG and DBF with
0.1 wt % were added to the monomer mixtures. The whole mixture was
stirred in the same way as above, except that the temperature was
increased to 70 °C, and was then confirmed to be uniformly dissolved.

5.2 Photopolymerization Procedure
The
mixtures were injected into a 10 μm gap formed between two glass
substrates of size 20 × 25 × 1 mm, where the actual measured
gap in the experiment was 9.6 ± 0.6 μm. The substrate surfaces
were untreated to avoid favoring any particular orientation of the
LC molecules and were cleaned by ultrasonication and ozonization.
Two-beam interferential exposures were carried out to enable PPIPS
of the mixtures in the gaps. The light source was a continuous-wave
single-mode Nd:YVO4 laser with a wavelength of 532 nm (J150GS,
Showa Optronics Co., Ltd.). The laser light was expanded, collimated,
and split into two pathways, each with an intensity of 20 ± 2
mW cm–2. Then, the two beams were superposed on
the cells at angles of incidence of 15° and −15°
relative to the plane perpendicular to the cell surface for fabricating
HPDLCs. The superposition was designed to produce sinusoidal intensity
fringes with a 1 μm pitch in the cell. During exposure, the
mixture in the cell was maintained at a constant temperature Tex that was varied between 25 and 70 °C.
After an interferential exposure over 5 min, any residual monomer
was polymerized by a uniform 5 min irradiation with an ultraviolet
lamp of intensity 0.8 mW cm–2 at room temperature.

5.3 Measurement and Observation
The diffraction
intensity was measured for wavelengths ranging from 0.3 to 2.5 μm
and an angle of incidence θ in air varying between 20°
and 60°, using a spectrophotometer (U4100, Hitachi High-Technologies
Corp.). The angles of incidence and diffraction were adjusted to satisfy
the Bragg condition. The diffraction efficiency was determined by
normalizing the diffraction intensity with the incident intensity.
This was done separately for linear polarizations parallel and perpendicular
to the plane formed by the incident and diffracted rays, referred
to as the p- and s-polarizations, with diffraction efficiencies ηp and ηs, respectively.12

Infrared absorption near the 2226 cm–1 peak is an indicator of the molecular orientation of the cyano-biphenyl
LC.60 The absorption areas Ap and As, relating to the
p- and s-polarization states, respectively, were measured separately
using an FTIR spectrophotometer (Frontier, PerkinElmer Co., Ltd.)
together with an infrared polarizer. The orientation ordering of the
LC molecules was hence determined as S = (Ap – As)/(Ap + 2As). The optical
anisotropies of the LC- and polymer-rich periodic phases were observed
using a polarizing optical microscope (MT9430, Meiji Techno Co., Ltd.)
in a crossed-nicols configuration. Cross sections of the periodic
structure were observed using a SEM (S-4300, Hitachi High-Technologies
Corp.) after the samples were cut and rinsed with methanol to dissolve
the LC droplets. The distribution and shape of the LC droplets were
manifested by the holes formed in the polymer.
