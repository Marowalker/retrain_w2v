spectroscopic
analysis of six new pinch-porphyrins: protoporphyrin-picpenta 1, mesoporphyrin-picpenta 2, deuteroporphyrin-picpenta 3, protoporphyrin-picocta 4, mesoporphyrin-picocta 5, and deuteroporphyrin-picocta 6. The Michaelis–Menten
enzymatic pathway and the guaiacol test confirmed the ability of the
compounds to function like new peroxidase models. UV–vis, 1H NMR, and electron spin resonance studies are in accordance
with porphyrin-Fe(III) molecules with the quantum phenomena called
quantum mixed spin (qms, s = 3/2, s = 5/2). Importantly, the influence of the presence of the s = 3/2 spin state in the compounds and its critical role
for the catalytic capacity is proven here, which was the original
hypothesis in our research group. The compounds with higher populations
of the s = 3/2 spin state have increased peroxidase
activity.

Introduction
Most physiological reactions occur within
the cell, and diverse
enzymes catalyze them.1 Particularly, the
peroxidase enzymes from plants and animals are of interest to many
researchers because of their promising biocatalytic capability for
oxidizing a wide range of aromatic substrates including various industrial
dyes.2 The peroxidases belong to the group
of hemeproteins. This group carries out several relevant biological
functions, and among them, we find O2 transport, storage
and reduction, electron transfer, redox catalysis, and O2 and CO sensing.3 The peroxidases belong
to the biggest superfamily of biocatalyzers and are evolutionarily
related monomeric proteins, usually with a molecular weight ranging
from 35 000 to 45 000 Da.4−6 Moreover, peroxidase
enzymes at the resting state exhibit a single heme b cofactor with a high-spin s = 5/2 penta-coordinated
Fe(III), with axial coordination via the Nε
of conserved proximal histidine. The imidazole ring of this histidine
is approximately perpendicular to the porphyrin plane, giving the
molecule mobility within the plane and allowing the coordination to
a possible sixth substituent.7−9 This feature has a key role for
O2 release on Fe(III), and, hence, for life itself.10

The magnetic state of Fe(III) in hemoproteins
is a consequence
of the porphyrin coordination. In this sense, when porphyrin is axially
coordinated to strong, weak, or middle field ligands, it presents
all three different possibilities of magnetic structures. The electronic
arrangement of Fe(III) corresponds to the five unpaired 3d electrons, giving various possible spin states such as low spin s = 1/2, the not observed intermediate spin s = 3/2, high spin s = 5/2, and the quantum mixed
spin (qms) s = 3/2, s = 5/2. In
a low spin octahedral environment, the unpaired electron is initially
assigned to dx2–y2 and partially delocalized in the dxy orbital.11 It is well known that if the native protein horseradish
peroxidase (HRP) lacks a substituent in the sixth coordination position,
the energy gap of the nondegenerated dx2–y2 and dz2 orbitals
is narrower. However, the coordination of a sixth ligand can result
in the displacement of the Fe ion located nearest to the porphyrin
plane. This displacement results in a complex with a distorted octahedral
geometry. This “in–out” movement between the
highest and the lowest spin of the iron ion will direct the qms contribution
for the different spin state mixtures of Fe(III) according to the
crystal field theory.12 A quantic mixture
of pure spin states in a hemoprotein means that the wave function
representing the electronic configuration of the Fe-hemo contains
contributions of two or more unequal spin states,13−15 which is the
case for this work as the different spectroscopic tools prove.

Additionally, Reyes-Ortega et al. studied the proportion of the
qms in many peroxidase models.16 Those
models presented the qms phenomenon for the Fe(III) ion, which is
also present in some native peroxidases such as the horseradish peroxidases
A2 and C2, Japanese peroxidase, and myeloperoxidases.13 Interestingly, the length of the aliphatic chain in the
pinch ligand seemed to play an important role in the s = 3/2 proportion in the qms of Fe(III) and in the enzymatic kinetics of the models, as shown
in Table 1.

As discussed later in this article, the new compounds
included
here support the hypothesis of the length of the aliphatic chain of
the pinch ligand affecting the qms ratio, and even the lack of nitrogen
inside this chain is crucial for their efficiency as catalysts. In
this work, we use compounds 1–6 which are obtained
from the chemical reaction of proto, meso, and deuteroporphyrin with
the novel ligand picpenta (seven atoms of length chain) and picocta
(11 atoms of length chain), which do not contain the mid-chain nitrogen
atom, as presented in Scheme 1.

Results and Discussion
Ultraviolet–Visible Spectra
The absorption spectra
of free porphyrins have a unique shape containing four Q bands and
the Soret band, having the D2h symmetry and increasing it to D4h in the metallic coordination sphere when an ionic
metal is added to the porphyrin ring center.17 When a pinch ligand coordinates to the iron cation in the porphyrins,
we can expect a system of penta or hexa coordination; thus, these
changes should be evident in the UV–vis plots [Figure S2]. A summary of the more representative
changes is reported in Table 2.

The typical UV–vis bands for Fe(III) containing
qms are
identifiable in Figure S2, in the range
of 580–550 nm for all the pinch-porphyrin compounds studied
herein.18 Furthermore, the Soret band for 1–6 decreases because the intensity of the transition
in the system is lower due to the change in the geometry of the molecule,
which becomes axially coordinated to the pinch ligand.19,20

NMR 1H Spectroscopy
To further analyze the
formation of the complexes and their electronic spin configuration,
NMR proton measurements were performed in CD3OD at different
temperatures. The chemical shifts in the paramagnetic region presented
in Table 3 for 1–6 are in accordance with previous assignments of
similar pinch-porphyrin complexes.16 However,
the dynamics of the porphyrin Fe(III) compounds at 300 K do not allow
us to convey in a simple conclusion of a six-coordinated Fe(III) complex.
Thus, experiments at low temperature were needed, Figure S1. The series of spectra show the lineshape of six-coordinated-like
porphyrin complexes.16−20 Furthermore, the heme-ethyl groups in these kinds of compounds have
been well studied, as well as their influence in the porphyrin’s
pyrrole rings protons. The admixture of the spin could be established
on the basis of the electronic and magnetic interaction over the longitudinal
axis (dx2–y2 orbital) with the electronic σ-spin
delocalization, resulting in different chemical shifts. The dependence
of the methyl-heme and meso-protons chemical shift has been associated
with the presence of the Fe(III) qms phenomenon. It has been shown
that the picdien-free porphyrin complexes present a S = 5/2 Fe configuration that is the result of the π-electron
system of the pyrrole conjugation. In this context, when the pinch
ligand is coordinated to the Fe(III), it is expected that the amine
groups, being a weak ligand field, open up the energy gap of the d
orbitals, provoking an admixture of Fe(III) states that could vary
depending of the type of porphyrin used. Then, the porphyrinic ring
is magnetically perturbed as well, yielding a more anisotropic environment,
for example, when the axial orbitals are unoccupied in the case of
a five-coordinated compound. We could study the contribution of this
magnetic effect in the ligand field of the pinch ligand to the qms
using the Qassym parameter which is calculated
from the chemical shift in the 1H NMR at different temperatures.
It has been studied that a six-coordinated value of Qassym is around 0.14.16,17

Figure 1 shows the
chemical shift versus the reciprocal temperature describing the linear
behavior of 1–6 in the CH3, vinyl-Hα,
α-CH2, and 2,4-H signals, which according to the
literature, demonstrates that six-coordinated compounds are formed
because they deviate from the Curie behavior seen for five-coordinated
compounds.

Additionally, the Walker–Nikolai equation
(eq 1) 1  is used to fit the data obtained from the
NMR experiments, which allows us to calculate the H-meso parameters F1 and F2 (Tables 4–6), which are the indicators of the dipolar and fermi contacts
in the ground and excited states of the pyrrolic protons, directly
affecting their chemical shifts,20−22 where δ(n) is the chemical shift in ppm of the lines in the
NMR 1H experiment, W1 is the statistical
weight (multiplicity) of the ground state, W2 is
the statistical weight (multiplicity) of the excited state, F1 is the Curie factor of the ground state, F2 is the Curie factor of the excited state, and ΔE/KBT is the energy gap.

Factor F1 for 1–6 for the
H-heme signals are always negative, being this typically displayed
for unoccupied dx2–y2 orbitals and a vast
electron density delocalization over the π orbitals. In this
case, the spin state s = 3/2 is energetically the
lowest level. The values obtained for F2 are negative
or near to zero for 1–6 because of no changes
in σ localization through the variance of temperature. A different
analysis of Figure 2 was made through the linearization of temperature dependence, in
other words, through the elimination of the spin state s = 5/2.

temperature and fits to the equation of Walker–Nikolai.18

The Curie factors obtained for this adjustment
are as follows (ppm
K): F(1) = −6.98 × 10–3F(2) = −19.06
× 10–3F(3) =
−3.58 × 10–3F(4) = −11.74 × 10–3F(5) = −6.52 × 10–3F(6) = −10.29 × 10–3. The resulting Curie factors are clear evidence that the spin state s = 3/2 in the Fe(III) species has enormous contribution
when the magnetic levels are independent of the thermic energy or
when the temperature tends towards 0 K. The discussed parameters were
obtained by setting the statistical weigh state  and 4/6. This group of values is representing
the spin states: S1 = S2 = 3/2, S1 = 3/2, S2 = 5/2 and S1 =
5/2 S2 = 3/2.

Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy
The electron spin
resonance (ESR) spectra of 1–6 are displayed in Figure 3, where three species
of Fe(III) were identified: species A, B, and C. For precursor porphyrins,
the ESR spectra showed a rhombic species, Figure 3, with g’s of ∼12,
5, and 2. Two axial spectra have been reported for porphyrinic systems
with the qms s = 3/2, s = 5/2 ground
state.13,16,20 ESR spectra
of pinch-porphyrin Fe(III) complexes showed a new lineshape and several
Fe(III) species, corresponding to the different spin states as discussed
earlier. The Fe(III) pinch-porphyrins showed a rhombic line shape
after the addition of the pinch ligand for 1–6, which is different from those showed for free porphyrins, indicating
that the axial coordination of the pinch ligand modified the ligand
field around Fe(III).17 The signals corresponding
to species B presented g⊥ values
between 6.5 and 5.3 and for species C, the value was ≈ 4.2.
The cc values for species A were between 4.3 and
4.05.11,20 Values of g⊥ = 6 and g∥ = 2 are reported to
belong to the pure high spin, s = 5/2, while the
signals with g⊥ = 4 and g∥ < 2 value would correspond to the
pure intermediate spin, s = 3/2. Signals from the
species with s = 1/2 are not analyzed in the present
work because high spin s = 5/2 and low spin s = 1/2 compounds have been largely studied.7,21

Figure 3 ESR
spectra of the porphyrin-Fe(III) complexes used in this work
and of their corresponding pinch complexes 1–6 at 77 K in the X-band.

Moreover, we performed the Maltempo–Moss
and Cammack,13 correlation curves treatment
of the crystal
splitting λ/Δ versus g⊥ giving values of λ/Δ among −1.2 and −2.3
for 1–6. The g⊥ values of species A, B, and C are taken from Figure 3 to obtain the admixtures present in the
novel compounds. The proportion of the s = 5/2 state
in the qms s = 5/2, s = 3/2 of Fe(III)
resulted, for the species A and for 1–6, larger
than 70%, species A being in higher proportion with respect to species
B and C.22 According to Nesset et al.23 for 1–6, it is concluded
that the Fe(III) ion is moved in the range of 0.10–0.30 Å
out of the porphyrin plane for s = 5/2. Thus, species
B of 1–6, showing qms, with more than 70% s = 3/2 may contain the Fe(III) ion moved out of the plane
≈0.30 Å. For species C in 1–6, the
treatments resulted in an admixture larger than 72.5% of s = 3/2, which coincides with previous studies for this species and
suggests that the iron ion might be displaced out of the plane a distance
of 0.10 Å. All these observations confirmed the fact that the
Fe(III) compounds have, indeed, a qms, but the B and C species, in
all compounds, have a major contribution of s = 3/2
in the quantic mixture. As we will see further in the discussion,
when similar porphyrinic systems are analyzed throughout kinetic parameters,
a major contribution of the spin state s = 3/2 will
determine the reaction rate.16,20

The ESR analysis
helped us correlate the Michaelis constant values
and the kcat with the amount of quantic
mixture in the system (Table 8). This correlation shows (a) when the predominant spin state
is s = 3/2 over 5/2 in the major species of Fe(III)
with qms, the catalytic peroxidase activity is higher and thus, (b)
the lowest kcat values for these type
of models are directly related to the percentage of species C. In
the present work, the low catalytic activity of 1–6 results from the fact that species with more s =
3/2 are the less abundant part of the mixture.

The ESR and UV–vis
analysis ensure that the coordination
of the pinch-ligand happened, however, according to a preliminary
density functional theory (DFT) relaxed structure and previous studies,16,20 one of the axial coordination is made by the methanol solvent on
the account of stress that will be imposed on the structure in case
two axial coordination of pyridines are forced, Figure 4.

novel compounds.
Note the Hmeso···Npicdien interaction
which stabilizes the pinch-porphyrin structure.

Magnetism
The interpretation of the Fe(III) spin states
was examined by magnetic measurements for complex 1–6 using SQUID magnetometry because of the exact predictions of the
spin states of the compounds over the temperature range 2–300
K. Sample solutions at ca. 0.001 mM of 2–6 were
found in fact to exhibit χMT ≈
1.57 cm3 K/mol at 300 K (Table 7), which are in accordance with the Fe(III)
χMT spin-only values for S = 3/224 except for 1 which is χMT ≈ 2.5 cm3 K/mol and stays steady during the temperature variation.

a Spin only expected values for S = 3/2, χMT = 1.875 cm3 K/mol and for S = 1/2, χMT = 0.375 cm3 K/mol.

Moreover, a variation of χMT values
is also shown while the temperature decreases as seen in Figure 5. This decay could
be attributed to the porphyrin-Fe(III) plane that at low temperatures
lacks mobility, and it is stabilized toward the low spin configuration
Fe(III), S = 1/2 with χMT ≈ 0.37 cm3 K/mol.25 This behavior of the Fe(III) species is shown, as well
as plots of effective magnetic moment (μeff) versus
the temperature (Figure S6) for 1–6.

Figure 5 Temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility of 1–6.

Kinetic Behavior
To confirm the peroxidase-like behavior,
guaiacol tests18 were performed for 1–6, followed by UV–vis, resulting in λmax (nm) for the guaiacol oxidation products (Scheme S1), proving their formation. Additionally, the data
from UV–vis spectra allowed us to perform a Michaelis–Menten
study for each compound, proving that the compounds behave as enzymes
ruled by this model.26,27 Complementarily, the guaiacol
test proves even further that 1–6 are indeed the
peroxidase model. By adjusting the guaiacol test graphs with the Michaelis–Menten
model V0 = Vmax[S]/(Km + [S]), we are able to emphasize two different regions: (a) the linear
area which is the initial part and exhibits a first-order kinetic
and (b) the asymptotic part which is the end area and has a zero-order
kinetic, from which the three concentrations of guaiacol were used
to quantify the kinetic constants (Table S1).

The complete kinetic parameters of 1–6 are calculated from the Michaelis–Menten plots (Figures S3–S6). The 10 optimum concentrations
of 1–6 were obtained by fixing one H2O2 concentration and one guaiacol concentration (Table S1). Equivalent experiments were made to
determine the 10 optimum concentrations for guaiacol and H2O2.

Therefore, according to the classic ping-pong
peroxidase kinetic
model, it is possible to obtain a primary plot (Figure 6) which is adjusted with eq 2.28 2  where [E]0 is
the compound’s concentration and KH2O2 and Kguaiacol are the Michaelis constants, and kcat is the theoretical maximum rate constant. A straight line results
from the previous equation, being KH2O2/kcat the slope, and
by using three different concentrations of guaiacol, we obtained two
more parallel lines. The primary intercepts (PIs) to [E]/V0 were obtained from the classic ping-pong
model as well for each of the guaiacol concentration producing the
secondary plot.

Figure 6 Primary plots for 1–6.

From the PI plots versus 1/[guaiacol] (secondary
plots), kcat for 1–6 is calculated.
The low affinity that compounds 1–6 have for H2O2 is clear, Table 8. Furthermore, Kguaiacol for 1–6 is smaller
than that for KH2O2; hence, their affinity for guaiacol is higher, being in accordance
with the native peroxidase mechanism, where once the enzyme is oxidized,
it will immediately oxidize the substrate. Then, from the PI plots
versus 1/[guaiacol] (secondary plots), kcat for 1–6 are calculated. Finally, the complexes
showed kcat in the same order of magnitude
(102 M–1 s–1) and fall
into the same class of complexes already reported, and the complete
set of kinetic parameters can be found in Table 8.

Table 8 helped us
complete an extensive study in our research group. It becomes clearer
that there is an optimal length of the aliphatic chain in the pinch
ligand to achieve better catalytic effect of the compounds (Figure 7 and Table 8). Another fundamental characteristic
in the pinch ligand is the influence of the nitrogen atom present
in the middle of the chain because this can stabilize the mobility
of the structure. The trend of the plot in Figure 7 shows that the larger the chain, the least
catalytically efficient the model is; however, as we can see, the
ligands with an equal number of atoms have higher catalytic activity
if a nitrogen atom is present in the middle of the chain.

Figure 7 Influence of
the chain length of the pinch ligand in the catalytic
activity of peroxidases models16,20 (with permission of
Reyes-Ortega, Y. et al. Dalton Trans. 1998,4, 667–674), asterisks indicate when a nitrogen
atom is present in the middle of the chain.

Conclusions
Six novel compounds of the pinch-porphyrin
family were synthesized
with a simple methodology. They have catalytic activity when tested
as peroxidases models as well. However, the reaction rates were lower
than the ones for native proteins such as the HRP and for the three
porphyrin-Fe(III) used: proto, meso, and deuteroporphyrin, which according
to our research group, is explained by the number of the atoms in
the aliphatic chain of the ligand and the percentage of the Fe(III)
species with s = 3/2. According to the UV–vis
and ESR spectroscopic analyses, all compounds showed different spin
states of Fe(III). These Fe species exhibit additionally to the high,
intermediate, and low spin, the qms in the Fe(III), but the contribution
in the species is different among the six complexes. Compounds 1 and 4 were the best peroxidase models with kcat = 2.00 × 104 and 4.58 ×
102 M–1 s–1, respectively,
and s = 3/2 percentage contribution of 85 and 92%
in the species B and 80 and 90% in the species C. It is worth mentioning
that both species are not necessarily the most abundant of all the
three. This work helps us extend the study of the pinch-porphyrin
compounds by our research group and adds to the interpretation that
the percentage of the spin state in Fe(III) correlates with its catalytic
activity; hence, we direct our research toward the synthesis of pinch
porphyrin compounds with ligands that satisfy the s = 3/2 species to achieve better artificial peroxidases.

Materials and Methods
Titration and other spectrophotometric
measurements were performed
on a UV–vis/NIR Shimadzu 3100 spectrophotometer at 25 °C.
The 1H NMR was measured using the CD3OD solvent
in a Bruker 500 MHz frequency magnet in a range from −30 to
30 °C. ESR spectra were recorded using ultrapure quartz tubes
of 3 mm on a JEOL JES-RE3X spectrometer at liquid-nitrogen temperature.
The recording parameters in the microwave X-band (9.8 GHz) were as
follows: sweep width 8000 G, power attenuation 20 mW, mode phase 100
kHz, and a time constant of 30 s. Magnetic measurements were performed
in methanol at ca. 0.001 mM of 1–6 in a gelatin
capsule using a Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS, Quantum
Design, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) from Quantum Design. Measurements
were performed in small magnetic fields, from 20 to 200 G; the data
were adjusted with the subtraction of the diamagnetic Pascal constant
of methanol, the pinch ligand, and porphyrin.

Materials
Spectrophotometric and kinetic measurements
were conducted in anhydrous methanol. The iron-porphyrins were prepared
as described in previous studies.16,29 The pinch
ligand 1,9-bis-(2-pyridyl)-2,8-diazanonane (picpenta) was prepared
by the method of Ahmed et al., while the 1,12-bis-(2′-pyridil)-2,11-diazododecane
(picocta) was obtained by the Sánchez-Sandoval methodology.16,30 The kinetic studies were conducted using aqueous 20.1 mM solution
of guaiacol; porphyrin-iron methanolic solutions were in the range
of 0.015–0.030 mM and the hydrogen peroxide solution was in
the range of 1400–1600 mM.

Preparation of Iron-Pinch-Porphyrin Complexes
All pinch
porphyrin complexes were synthesized using the method reported by
Reyes-Ortega and co-workers. At 25 °C, 5 mL of Fe(III) porphyrin
(0.01 mM) in methanol was added to 5 mL of 0.02 mM of the picpenta
or picota ligand. The mixture was stirred for 6 h. The spectroscopic
and kinetic studies were performed directly on the reaction solutions.

Kinetic Studies
Rate determinations of iron-porphyrin-catalyzed
oxidation of guaiacol with hydrogen peroxide were carried out as previously
described for horseradish peroxidase31 and
other compounds. The used concentrations are reported in the Table S1. The oxidation product concentrations
were determined by optical spectrophotometry. In order to observe
the oxidation products (Scheme S1), the
reaction (guaiacol with peroxide in the presence of each pinch-porphyrin
complex) was observed by UV–vis spectroscopy with time intervals
of 90 s. It is important to note that the complexes were stable throughout
the studies. The pH range was 6.5–7.0, and the final concentrations
were 0.017, 0.160, and 11.27 mM.
