Realizing
quantitative surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)
analysis is extremely helpful and challenging. Here, we utilize a
facile method to synthesize spiked plasmonic nanorods with an interior
gap. The Raman signal from the molecules embedded in the gap can be
dramatically enhanced, leading to strong, stable, and reproducible
SERS signals that can be used as an internal reference for quantitative
SERS analysis. We demonstrate that the rough exterior surface has
a good performance in enhancing the Raman signal of polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbon molecules adsorbed on the surface. The result shows that
this method is applicable for a large range of analyte concentrations
and there is an excellent linear relationship between the SERS intensity
ratio and the analyte concentration (0.5–100 μM).

Introduction
Surface-enhanced Raman
scattering (SERS) has been recognized as
a powerful protocol that is capable of detecting molecular vibrations,
which can be viewed as fingerprint information on various organic
molecules, biomolecules, and cells and tissues.1−3 SERS is an ultrasensitive
method, as the Raman signal can be dramatically enhanced as much as
1010 to 1011 times in some plasmonic nanostructure,4 which allows to detect even one single molecule.4−7 Compared with the conventional techniques such as fluorescence,
electrochemistry, and high-performance liquid chromatography, SERS
holds significant advantages.8−12 For example, higher resolution on multiplex samples as SERS provides
fingerprint signatures of analytes endowing with better anti-interference
resistance. Generally, SERS enhancement is ascribed to electromagnetic
and chemical enhancement, and the former contributes to most of SERS
enhancement. The electromagnetic enhancement is localized at the “hotspots”
resulting from the coupling of the localized surface plasmon resonance
(LSPR) on the surface or in the junctions of plasmonic nanoparticles.13−16 Optimizing the structure of plasmonic nanoparticles including size,
shape, surface morphology, and composition is important in improving
the reproducibility and sensitivity of SERS assays. The typical approach
is to use the target molecule to induce the aggregation of nanoparticles
forming a large number of hotspots in solution.8,17 However,
problems still remain due to the random and poor reproducibility of
the hotspots, resulting in lack of quantitative SERS data and wide
distribution of enhancement factors.13 In
addition, the operational and instrumental factors also have a profound
influence on the Raman signal.17 Therefore,
to date, it is still a great challenge to realize quantitative SERS
analysis.18−20

In previous studies, researchers have attempted
to use internal
standards to achieve sensitivity and reproducibility simultaneously.21−26 However, the internal standard molecules can be influenced by the
microenvironment of the solution and compete for the surface adsorption,
leading to the fluctuation of the intensity and frequency.1,27,28 Recently, a new structure based
on core–molecule–shell nanoparticles has captured great
attention.4,29,30 The interior
gap between the core and the shell provides controllable hotspots
and uniformity for SERS enhancement.4,31 The Raman
molecules inside the gap could generate a highly stable, strong, and
quantitative SERS signal. In particular, DNA, polymer-functionalized
spherical Au nanoparticles, and galvanic replacement reaction have
been reported to synthesize these nanostructures with nanometer interior
gaps, exhibiting strong and stable SERS signals.4,29,30,32,33 For example, it was shown that galvanic replacement
reaction between silver and gold facilitates the formation of gold
nanorods (GNRs) with uniform interior nanogaps with a stable, strong,
and reproducible SERS signals.32 Other
methods such as small molecule-interlayered plasmonic structure and
SiO2 interlayered gold structures also have been used to
synthesize nanostructures with interior gaps.34−36 The standard
molecule inside the gap between the core and shell was in a safe environment
without perturbation from outside, and the surface of the shell was
free without competitive adsorption. However, for these structures,
they still have some shortcomings, such as laborious synthetic procedures
and long preparation times. More importantly, all of these structures
reported so far have smooth surfaces. It has been shown that the most
important factor affecting SERS intensity is the shape of the nanoparticles.37 The shapes with tips and edges can localize
the plasmonic near field and create hotspots around the edges.38−40 The plasmonic nanostructures with more tips and edges will provide
higher sensitivity in SERS analysis.41,42 Up to now,
there has been no method to synthesize such spiked plasmonic nanorods
with an interior gap, without the need to use DNA templates, for direct
quantitative SERS analysis. Herein, an efficient method to prepare
plasmonic substrates with spiked surfaces and interior gaps by employing
a polydopamine internal shell is reported. This structure is very
reliable and suitable for quantitative SERS analysis, as the spiked
surface provides a higher surface enhancement in a variety of samples.
We used 4-mercaptopyridine (4-mp) as an internal standard in the nanogap
(Scheme 1). This is
a label-free method with high sensitivity and was successfully tested
to detect polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) quantitatively.
The limit of detection is up to 0.3 μM. Finite-difference time-domain
(FDTD) simulation is also used to confirm these results.

Structure, Based on GNRs, for Quantitative SERS Analysis of PAHs
Results and Discussion
Only three steps are needed to synthesize the GGN with interior
gaps. Herein, we introduced pristine GNRs as the core (Figure S1), of which the surface was modified
by 4-mp as internal molecules via Au–S bonds. Afterward, the
mpGNRs were treated with dopamine (DA) and tris buffer (pH = 8) for
1 h to yield poly-DA-coated species (mpGNRs@DA). Noted that, under
alkaline conditions, phenolic catechols were oxidized to quinones,
causing the formation of 5,6-dihydroxyindolines, their derivatives,
and then leading to the polymerization to form oligomers. These were
crammed by π–π stacking, charge transfer, and hydrogen
bonding to form a nanometer thick poly-DA layer.43 As shown in Figure S2, we can
see that there is a thin layer of poly-DA outside the GNRs and the
thickness is about 2.6 nm. These functional groups such as catechol,
amine, and imine can serve as both an anchor and reaction sites for
loading metal ions,44,45 and the catechol takes the role
of a reducing agent for gold nucleation and growth.46 Catechol was oxidized to quinones by Au(III), and small
gold nanoparticles were produced on randomly oriented oxidized sites
of the poly-DA shell. Further anisotropic growth of gold nanoparticles
were activated by the reduction of HAuCl4 by hydroxyl amine
which was subsequently added.10 From the
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy
images (Figures 1a
and S3), we found that the GGNR structure
is uniform and the surface of gold shell is rough and spiky. We applied
scanning TEM (STEM) to demonstrate the core–shell structure
with an interior gap, as expect, the spatial distribution of the Au
core, the spiked gold shell, and the interior gap could be clearly
identified (Figure 1c,d). It is worth mentioning that the amount of HAuCl4 plays an important role in the synthesis. The density of the small
gold nanoparticles increases by raising the amount of HAuCl4 (Figure S4). At first, there are some
sporadic gold nanoparticles on the surface; then, it becomes a whole
shell. In case more HAuCl4 added, the particles will become
bigger and smooth (Figure S4c).

of GGN with interior gaps. (b) High-resolution transmission
electron microscopy image of a typical GGN. (c) STEM image of GGN
with interior gaps. (d) STEM image a typical GGN.

The SERS properties of GGN were tested by three laser colors
(785,
660, and 532 nm) (Figure S5). Excited by
785 nm laser, GGN shows the most glaring response in the near infrared
region. In the case of 532 nm, little SERS signal was observed, by
contrast to 785 or 660 nm, where the SERS signals were raised enormously.
This is because 532 nm is outside the peak region of the UV–vis
spectrum of nanorods (Figure S6). Under
laser irradiation, there is no measurable changes in time sequence
SERS spectra of GGN (Figure S7). This leaves
out the laser trapping effect on the aggregation of particles.1,47 From these experimental results, sufficient and stable SERS signals
were obtained with excitation at either 785 nm or 660 nm.

We
used pyrene (Pyr), anthracene (Ant), and naphthalene (Nap) as
target molecules that are PAHs to verify the quantitative SERS analysis.
The PAH molecules can be adsorbed on the surface of GGN. In the adsorption
process, the time-dependent SERS spectra exhibited stable signals
in 1 h after the addition of PAH molecules (Figure S8). The Pyr, Ant, and Nap all have a few characteristic peaks
as compared to 4-mp, and the unique peaks for 4-mp are located around
∼1000 cm–1 (Figure 2). It has been experimentally proved that
nearly no Raman signals of Pyr, Ant, Nap, and 4-mp in water were found
even at a high concentration level (3 × 10–4 M). However, the SERS signals of Pyr, Ant, Nap, and 4-mp mixed GNRs
were remarkably enhanced (Figure 2). As a result, it could be concluded that the SERS
signals were generated as these molecules reside close to the particle
surfaces but not from the molecules themselves during the detection.

Figure 2 Raman
spectra of Pyr (a), Ant (b), Nap (c), and 4-mp (d) powder,
in water and mixed with GNRs. The spectra were obtained by 785 nm
laser.

Moreover, the as-synthesized GGN
was mixed with Pyr of various
concentrations for quantitative SERS analysis. After incubation of
1 h with the addition of Pyr, two new peaks of Pyr have been observed
at ∼590 and ∼1400 cm–1. The SERS intensity
of Pyr fluctuated with parallel samples, but the reproducibility can
be improved by normalizing the data to that of 4-mp (at ∼1000
cm–1) (Figure S9). By
lowering the concentration, the intensity of the characteristic peaks
of Pyr declines correspondingly (Figure 3a). In order to correct the fluctuations
in the instrumental factors and other unknown factors, the Pyr signals
(at ∼590 cm–1) were normalized to the SERS
intensity of internal molecules 4-mp (at ∼1000 cm–1). The intensity ratio of the target molecule (Pyr) to internal standard
molecule shows a good linear relationship with the Pyr concentration
(Figure 3b). The same
operation was used for Ant and Nap. As depicted in Figure 3c, we can find that the peak
intensities at ∼400, ∼750, and ∼1400 cm–1 are all decreasing along with the concentration of Ant going down;
the normalized peak at ∼1400 cm–1 to that
of 4-mp was used for quantitative detection. The relative SERS intensity
versing the Ant concentration follows a very nice curve (Figure 3d). We further applied
the GNN to the quantitative detection of Nap (Figure 3e,f). The linearity of these working cures
demonstrated a larger range of the analyte concentration, where the
highest concentration is 100 times larger than the lowest concentration.
From the linear working curve, the minimum response value of Pyr,
Ant, and Nap is lower than that has been reported in detecting PAH
molecules.48,49

concentrations of Pyr
(a), Ant (c), and Nap (e) as well as the linear relationship of SERS
intensities vs different concentrations of Pyr (b), Ant (d), and Nap
(f). The spectra were obtained by 785 nm laser.

To better understand the optical properties of the nanorod
structures
and verify the role of roughness through the far-field LSPR peak on
the wavelengths with observed Raman enhancements, we performed UV–vis
spectroscopy and compared our data with FDTD simulations for GGN. Figure 4a shows the UV–vis
spectra as compared with the calculated far-field extinction cross
sections of the two nanoparticles obtained by single-particle FDTD
simulations. The calculated far-field extinction cross-sectional spectra
for GGN were calculated for two polarization directions, along the
long axis of the rod (longitudinal) and normal to the long axis (transverse).
The larger extinction cross section at this wavelength for GNN contributes
to the larger enhancement factor measured for these particles in Table 1. To explore the role
of the roughness and extinction cross sections in the high performance
of GGN as a SERS substrate, the near-field distribution around the
modeled nanorod structures was calculated. Near-field enhancement
contributes to Raman enhancement, and resonant optical extinction
seen from the far field creates the strongest near-field enhancement,
so we calculate near field at that wavelength. It has been reported
that the SERS enhancement factor can be estimated from a term defined
as the product of the electric near-field intensity at the excitation
and Stokes frequencies.50−54Figure 4b shows the
calculated near-field distribution for an excitation wavelength of
785 nm and a Stokes wavelength of 824 nm (corresponding to a 600 cm–1 Raman shift) around a modeled GGN under longitudinal
excitation. It can be seen from this structure that the plasmon resonance
creates hotspots both inside the gap layer and at the shell surface.
Whereas the gap hotspots appear to be stronger in intensity, the surface
hotspots occupy a larger area, which also greatly affects the measured
SERS enhancement. To quantify the relative contributions from these
two types of hotspots, summation of the value over the corresponding
regions was evaluated and shown in Table 1. This overall enhancement in the detection
ability of GGN is consistent with the experimental observation of
the higher sensitivity.

as the product of the electric field intensity at the excitation (785

Conclusions
We have designed and
synthesized a new spiked plasmonic nanorod
with an interior nanogap for quantitative SERS analysis by using an
easy and cheap protocol. We used GNR as a core, 4-mp as an internal
standard to develop a novel spiked rodlike core–molecule–shell
nanostructure (GGN) with an interior gap by the support of polydopamine.
Because of both closeness to the LSPR peak of the excitation wavelength
and the rough surface, GGN provides a reliable SERS quantitative analysis
in detecting PAH molecules, showing a strong potential as quantitative
SERS detectors. The interior gap and surface roughness 
exhibited  high SERS enhancements that were also confirmed by
FDTD simulations. This will provide a new material for reliable quantitative
SERS analysis, detection, Raman imaging, and photothermal therapy.

Experimental
Section
Methods
HAuCl4·xH2O, hydroxylamine hydrochloride, polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP, Mw = 29 000), hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium
bromide (CTAB), NaBH4, ascorbic acid, 4-mp, DA, AgNO3, H2SO4, pyrene, anthracene, naphthalene,
and tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris) were all purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich and were used as received without further purification.
The deionized (DI) water (Millipore Milli-Q grade) prepared in-house,
with a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ, was used in all experiments.
TEM images were taken with a FEI Titan 80-300 KV STEM (voltage 300
kV). The nanoparticles were dispersed in water and drop-casted on
carbon-coated Cu grids. Raman spectra were collected by a Raman spectrometer
(Horiba Jobin Yvon, Labram Aramis) at the respective excitation wavelength
of 785, 660, and 532 nm. All of the Raman spectra of materials are
collected in the liquid phase.

Synthesis of GNRs
The GNRs were synthesized via a seed-mediated
procedure. Solution A: the gold seed solution was prepared by first
mixing an aqueous solution of CTAB (7.5 mL, 0.1 M) and HAuCl4 (100 μL, 24 mM). A freshly prepared aqueous solution (ice-cold)
of NaBH4 (0.6 mL, 0.01 M) was then added to the above mixture,
of which the color changed from yellow to brown. Then, 1.2 mL of DI
water was further added, and the mixture was aged for 3–4 h.
Solution B: an aqueous solution of ascorbic acid (800 μL, 0.1
M) was added to a mixed aqueous solution of HAuCl4 (2 mL,
24 mM), H2SO4 (2 mL, 0.5 M), CTAB (100 mL, 0.1
M), and AgNO3 (700 μL, 10 mM), of which the color
was changed from orange to colorless. For the final step, 240 μL
of solution A was added to solution B and kept at 30 °C for 12
h.

Synthesis of 4-mp-Modified GNRs (mpGNRs)
The prepared
GNR solution (5 mL) and an aqueous solution of 4-mp (3.85 × 10–4 M, 1 mL) were mixed and stirred overnight.

Synthesis
of DA-Coated mpGNRs (mpGNRs@DA)
The mpGNRs@DA
nanoparticles were synthesized as below: 1.5 mL of mpGNR solution
was centrifuged and dispersed in the DA solution (1.9 mL, 516 μM).
A 0.5 mL of Tris (10 mM) was then added. The mixture was sonicated
for 1 h. Finally, the mixture was centrifuged and resuspended in 1.5
mL of DI water.

Synthesis of Core–Shell Gold-Coated
mpGNRs@DA (GGN)
For the synthesis of GGN, 0.5 mL of mpGNRs@DA
was diluted to 2.5
mL by adding 2 mL of DI water. HAuCl4 (150 μL, 5
mM), PVP (50 μL, w/w, 5%), and hydroxyl amine (150 μL,
50 mM) solutions were added consecutively. The mixture was then sonicated
for 5 min. Noted that, in order to explore the density of gold shell,
different amounts of HAuCl4 (5 mM, 75 and 250 μL)
and hydroxyl amine (50 mM, 75 and 250 μL) were tested.

FDTD Simulations
FDTD simulations on the optical properties
of the single nanostructure were performed with Lumerical FDTD Solutions
software v8.11. A typical GGN structure was modeled but with an additional
layer of sphere-tipped gold nanocones to mimic the surface roughness
(Figure S10). A 2.66 fs broadband total-field
scatter-field pulse was used to excite the modeled structures with
a boundary condition of perfectly absorbed layer applied to all directions.
Detailed dimensions are shown in Table S1. All simulations were performed with a mesh size of 0.5 nm and a
background refractive index of 1.33 mimicking the aqueous solution
measurement. Both the far-field extinction cross-sectional spectra
and the near electric field distributions were recorded from the simulations.
Details of the simulation method used are described in our previous
publications.51,53−56
