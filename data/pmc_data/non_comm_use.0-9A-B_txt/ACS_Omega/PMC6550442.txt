In the last few decades,
marine metabolites have been exploited
to find commercially viable products in several areas. In this article,
molecular descriptors [log P, mass, total polar surface
area (TPSA), H-bond donor, H-bond acceptor, and the number of rotatable
bonds] for the marine-derived cytotoxic metabolites were calculated
and compared with marketed anticancer drugs to understand their position
in the drug-like space. Marine-based cytotoxic metabolites are divided
into highly toxic (HT) and moderately toxic (MT) classes. The marketed
anticancer drugs complied well with Lipinski’s rule of five
for all molecular descriptors. The majority of HT and MT metabolites
complied solely with H-bond donors and a number of rotatable bonds
with the Lipinski cutoff values. Hierarchical cluster analysis
(HCA) and principal component analysis (PCA) were also performed using
73 molecular descriptors on an ensemble of highly cytotoxic or moderately
cytotoxic marine metabolites and the marketed reference drugs. The
HCA results showed that 12% of marine metabolites clustered with the
marketed anticancer drugs and many of them had structural scaffold
homology. The PCA results revealed the presence of a clear distinction
between the cytotoxic marine metabolites and the marketed anticancer
drugs. Results indicate that mass, TPSA, and log P are the vital parameters and the careful optimization of these parameters
for marine cytotoxic metabolites may generate more meaningful
anticancer candidates in the future.

Introduction
Cancer is one of the
unbeatable causes of death worldwide. As per
the GLOBOCAN statistics for 2012, there are 14.2 million new cancer
cases, which are diagnosed and result in a mortality of 8.2 million
globally.1 In the last two decades, there
has been an alarming increase in cancer cases in the lesser developed
world. This is increasingly evident because of the 8–15% rise
in mortality due to cancer observed in developed countries as compared
to lesser developed ones. Prostate, colorectal, lung, and breast cancers
have high incidence rates in developed countries, whereas lesser developed
countries have witnessed an increase in liver, stomach, and cervical
cancer types owed to the prevalence of less hygienic conditions.2 Even though a battery of treatment options are
available, except acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the human battle is
ongoing against other cancer types. Chemotherapy is a primary treatment
option that has undergone dramatic progress in the last few decades.3 It has few important drawbacks such as toxicity
due to lack of specificity to cancer cells4 and multidrug resistance.5 To address
these pitfalls, the search for new drug candidates is essential. This
forces seeking the novel sourcing of new drug candidates in both academia
and the pharmaceutical industry.

Scientific exploration in the
ocean opened up a new avenue for
medicinal chemists and the pharmaceutical industry. MarinLit, a marine-based
natural product database contains about 24,000 compounds and 26,000
research articles; it is a good piece of evidence for the growing
interest in marine-sourced natural products. Excellent reviews on
marine natural products give detailed accounts of their sources and
the various classes of molecules derived from them.6−9 Marine-based natural products
have found wide application as pharmacologicals,10 nutraceuticals,10 cosmetics,10 antifouling agents,11 and surfactants.12 For pharmaceutical
application, many marine-based drugs are currently in the pipeline
for various disorders such as tetrododoxin for pain,13 DMXBA for neurological disorders,14 and plitidepsin for cancer.15 Cytarabine
(Ara-C) and trabectedin are approved as anticancer drugs by the USFDA
and EMA, respectively, having their origin in the ocean.16 The marine-based drug pipeline includes a number
of agents having exciting anticancer potential in various stages of
clinical trials.16

Modern medicinal
chemistry has acquired tools from chemoinformatics
to identify and predict the drug-like and pharmacokinetic properties
of new candidates.17 Molecular descriptors
explained by Lipinski—such as molecular weight (<500), log P (<5), H-bond donor (<5), and H-bond acceptor (<10)—are
useful to understand the oral absorption of drug or drug-like compounds.18,19 The extension of Lipinski’s rule to predict the drug-like
properties of compounds include polar surface area and molar refractability.20 Lipinski’s rule of five has been reduced
to three [molecular weight (<300), log P (<3),
H-bond donor (<3), and H-bond acceptor (<3)] to accommodate
the increase in molecular weight and lipophilicity during the lead
optimization stage in the drug discovery process.21 This article attempts to identify the possible drug-like
candidates from the different groups of marine-based cytotoxic metabolites
by analyzing their molecular descriptors benchmarked with currently
marketed anticancer drugs. Additionally, hierarchical cluster analysis
(HCA) and principal component analysis (PCA) have been performed on
the data to identify the marine metabolites in the drug-like space.

Results
and Discussion
The log P distribution for
highly and moderately
cytotoxic marine metabolites and the marketed cancer drugs is shown
in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Comparison
of log P for cytotoxic marine
metabolites and marketed anticancer drugs. Highly toxic (HT; blue);
moderately toxic (MT; red); marketed drug (green).

About 90% of the marketed drugs obeyed Lipinski’s
rule of
five (log P < 5)18,19 which includes
negative values. For the HT and MT categories, 72 and 84% accounted
for the range from −ve values to +5, respectively. Even while
excluding negative values, about 64% of HT and MT were in the range
of 0–5.

Marketed anticancer drugs showed a high (90%
including negative
values) compliance with Lipinski’s rule of five for log P, because they were modified to enhance the pharmacokinetic
properties, particularly oral availability. The average log P of HT, MT, and marketed anticancer drugs are 3.65, 2.16,
and 1.25, respectively. Three drugs (Ara-C, trebectedin, and eribilin
indicated in Figure 1) from marine origins among the marketed drugs category obeyed Lipinski’s
rule of five (0–5). The aqueous marine environment may be a
driving force for cyanobacteria or sponges to produce highly hydrophobic
cytotoxic metabolites having a high log P value,
which can be delivered to the target in their vicinity.

For
the mass distribution shown in Figure 2, 62 and 26% of marketed anticancer drugs
fall in the range of 0–500 and 500–1000, indicating
a significant number of deviations from Lipinski’s rule of
five (M < 500).

Figure 2 Comparison of mass for marine metabolites
and marketed anticancer
drugs. HT (blue); MT (red); marketed drug (green).

The majority of highly (77.94%) and moderately
(73.39) toxic marine
metabolites are in the range of 500–1000. Mass in the range
of 1000–2000 is contributed between 8 and 20%; hence, synthetic
and marine cytotoxic metabolites showed similar trends in this category.
The average mass for marketed anticancer drugs, highly (77.94%) toxic
marine metabolites, and moderately (73.39) toxic marine metabolites
are 517, 827, and 897, respectively. Out of three marine-derived reference
drugs, Ara-C obeyed Lipinski’s rule of five and other two (trabectedin
&
eribulin) showed a violation. There is a large difference in the average
mass between the marketed anticancer drugs and other cytotoxic marine
metabolites. Hence, mass and log P showed considerable
deviation for bench marked anticancer drugs and marine-based cytotoxic
metabolites.

Total polar surface area (TPSA) variation for marketed
anticancer
drugs and marine-based cytotoxic metabolites is shown in the Figure 3.

Figure 3 Comparison of TPSA for
cytotoxic marine metabolites and marketed
anticancer drugs. HT (blue); MT (red); marketed drug (green).

As per Lipinski’s rule
of five, TPSA has the range of 0–140.
In the case of marketed anticancer drugs, 64% complied with Lipinski’s
rule of five, whereas marine-based cytotoxic metabolites showed a
compliance of 21–30%. In the range 140–300, 56% of HT
and MT categories of marine cytotoxic metabolites were observed. In
the category of marine-derived reference drugs, Ara-C obeyed Lipinski’s
rule of five, whereas trabectedin & eribulin violated by having
a larger TPSA.

Lipinski’s rule of five limits the number
of rotatable bonds
to less than 10 (RB < 10) for a drug candidate. Figure 4 depicts distribution of RB
for marine metabolites and marketed anticancer drugs.

Figure 4 Comparison of number
of rotatable bonds for cytotoxic marine
metabolites and marketed anticancer drugs. HT (blue); MT (red); marketed
drug (green).

The percentage distribution
of marketed anticancer drugs, highly
cytotoxic, and moderately cytotoxic categories for the range 0–10
are 88, 64, and 48, respectively. Interestingly, the marketed anticancer
drugs including marine sources (Ara-C, trabectedin, eribulin) strictly
obeyed Lipinski’s rule of five with the highest percentage
distribution in the 0–10 range among the three different categories.
A decrease in the number of rotatable bonds makes the molecule rigid,
restricting the conformation freedom. Furthermore, it may freeze the
molecule in bioactive conformation, which confers the drug status
for the given candidate. This may account for a steady decrease in
the percentage distribution from marketed anticancer drugs to
highly cytotoxic and moderately cytotoxic categories for the range
0–10.

For H-bond donors, the percentage distribution
for marketed anticancer
drugs and cytotoxic marine metabolites is shown in the Figure 5.

Figure 5 Comparison of number
of hydrogen bond donors for cytotoxic marine
metabolites and marketed anticancer drugs. HT (blue); MT (red); marketed
drug (green).

HT and marketed anticancer drugs
account for about 80% for
the 0–5 range. The maximum number of hydrogen bond donors as
per Lipinski’s rule of five is five and its compliance is excellent
for the marketed anticancer drugs including marine sources (Ara-C,
trabectedin, eribulin) and the highly cytotoxic marine metabolites.
Moderately, cytotoxic metabolites are lagging behind (66% in the range
of 0–5) the other two categories in this respect.

Cluster
Analysis
HCA was performed on all the ctyotoxic marine
metabolites and marketed anticancer drugs, as shown in Figure 6.

Figure 6 Dendrogram of HCA showing
cytotoxic marine metabolites and
the marketed anticancer drug using Ward’s method (H denotes
highly cytotoxic marine metabolite, M denotes moderately cytotoxic
marine metabolite, R denotes marketed anticancer reference drug).

It is important to identity the
cytotoxic marine metabolites
clustering with marketed anticancer reference drugs, which is the
primary goal of HCA in this article. Molecular scaffold plays an important
role in the structure–activity relationship.22 It is classified into structural and functional scaffolds.
Hence, the comparison of structural and functional scaffolds of reference
drugs with marine metabolites is used to understand whether the clustering
similarity results from structural homology or nonstructural factors.
The comparison of scaffolds of reference drugs and marine metabolites
was based on the Bemis–Murcko framework, which presents the
structural scaffold along with the functional scaffolds associated
with them. All marine metabolites clustering with marketed reference
drugs are mentioned in Table 1. The dendrogram showing HCA of all the cytotoxic marine metabolites
and the marketed anticancer reference drugs is shown in Figure 6. It shows two major
clusters 1 and 2. Cluster 2 consisted of two subclusters F and G.
In the subcluster F, bleomycin (R8) showed a high degree of similarity
with the family of largamides (D,E,F,G) (M41–44). Scaffolds
showing the backbone and the rings are shown in the Supporting Information. The bleomycin scaffold showed that
it is an acyclic peptide molecule with two aromatic five-membered
rings at the N-terminal region and two nonaromatic six-membered rings.
It has a long twelve carbon tail ending with two thiazole rings. Bleomycin
exerts its cytotoxicity by intercalation of its peptide into the GC-rich
region of the DNA and the two thiazole rings bind metal ions leading
to the production of free radicals resulting in DNA cleavage.23 Largamides have a cyclic peptide head, a smaller
hydrophobic chain, and a six-membered aromatic ring at the end of
the molecule. Even though both bleomycin and largamides share certain
amounts of scaffold homology, largamides lack the functional scaffold
(like thiazole rings) to enter the drug-like space.

Reference drug degarelix (R15) clustered
with koshikamide A2 (M36)
and halicylindramide D (M16). Degarelix is GnRH antagonist24 and functional scaffold requirements are fused
aromatic ring at the N-terminal and a linear peptide structure having
aromatic rings on either side and a five membered ring aliphatic ring
at the C-terminal region. Degarelix can be compared with leuprolide,
which is a GnRH agonist showing structural similarity. In this cluster
(R15-M36-M16), koshikamide A2 showed few structural similarities to
degarelix; it has a six-membered aromatic ring at the C-terminal and
lacks aromatic rings between the N- and C-terminal regions.

Eribulin (R17) clustered with piperazimycins (A,B,C-H57-59). Eribulin
is a cylic macrolide and it destabilizes the microtubule assembly
by acting as a hydrogen bond breaker.25 However, the piperazimycins have a cyclic structure having both
H-bond donors and acceptors. Because of this, the hydrogen bond breaking
capacity of eribulin is higher than piperazimycins.

Actinomycin
D (R3) clustered with thiocoraline (H64). As shown
in the supplement 2, both peptides did not show any structural scaffolds.
Actinomycin has a homodimer and the thiocoraline is a bicyclic peptide.
Moreover, the most important functional scaffold in actinomycin D
is the phenoxazone ring, which binds to the GC base pairs in the DNA,26 preventing the RNA polymerase from binding to
the DNA.

Leuprolide (R25) and wewakazole (M107) clustered and
both the peptides
showed structural variations. Leuprolide is a linear peptide and wewakazole
is a cyclic peptide and the geometry of functional scaffolds is essential
for bioactivity.

Ixabepilone27 (R24)
and mitomycin (R28)
clustered with cryptophycin 128(H15) and
Cryptophycin 52 (H16). Both the cryptophycins share cyclic peptide
scaffold homology with ixabepilone and all three inhibit microtubule
assembly.

In the dendrogram of HT and reference drugs, few clusters
having
both the marine metabolites and the reference drugs were observed
in Figure 7. Paclitaxel
(R29), trabectedin (R32), vinblastine (R33), and vinorelbine (R34)
clustered with diazonamide (H18) and microcolin A (H47). Paclitaxel,
trabectedin, vinblastine, vinorelbine, and diazonamide showed complex
fused ring systems. Except trabectedin, the other four showed binding
to microtubules.27 In the second cluster,
anastrozole (R4) clustered with smenothiazoles A and B. All three
showed a heterocyclic five-membered ring connected to either a six-membered
(anatrozole) or five-membered ring systems (smenothiazoles). Anastrozole
binds to the aromatase in which the azole electron deficient nitrogen
binds to the heam prosthetic group in the enzyme.29 Similarly, smenothiazoles have thiazole rings, which may
be responsible for bioactivity. Finally, degarelix (R15) and bleomycin
(R8) clustered with palauamide (H55) in which degarelix and bleomycin
showed structural homology having an open peptide structure with aromatic
rings between the N- and C-terminal regions. Palauamide is a cyclic
peptide with one benzene ring and does not share much with the other
two reference drugs.

Figure 7 Dendrograms of HCA showing HT marine metabolites (H) and
the marketed
anticancer drug (R) using Ward’s method.

The dendrogram having moderately marine metabolites and reference
drugs showed two interesting clusters in Figure 8. First, ixabepilone (R15) clustered with
pseudodysidenin (M75) in which both showed the thiazole ring, as stated
in earlier sections, thiazole is an important functional scaffold
for many bioactive compounds. Ixabepilone inhibits the microtubules27 and the exact mechanism of pseudodysidenin is
not known; thiazole may have functional role in its bioactivity. The
second cluster, tamoxifen (R30), clustered with virenamides (A–C)
(M103, M104, and M105) and belamide (M3). Three ring connectivities
are the structural scaffold in this cluster and they are observed
in all four molecules except virenamide A. In the case of tamoxifen,
three aromatic ring systems may be important for binding to the estrogen
receptor30 and the thiazole ring present
in virenamides may be the important functional scaffold.

Principal
Component Analysis
The suitability of PCA was assessed prior
to the analysis. The overall Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO)
measure and Bartlett’s test of sphericity for three data sets
are given in Table 2.

Table 2 PCA Datasets and Their Quality Parameters
PCA
dataset	dataset
size	KMO
values	Bartlett’s test of sphericity	
HT + MT + reference drugs (dataset 1)	212	0.807	<0.0005	
HT + reference drugs (dataset 2)	103	0.681	<0.0005	
MT + reference drugs (dataset 3)	143	0.810	<0.0005	
Dataset 1 & 3 showed
the KMO value > 0.7 indicating that
the classifications belong to middling to meritorious according to
Kaiser.31 Dataset 2 (HT + reference drugs)
KMO falls between the mediocre to middling category and the KMO values
of all the data sets indicate PCA is well applicable to all analyses
using PCA. Bartlett’s test of sphericity for all three datasets
was <0.0005, indicating that all three datasets were likely factorizable.

The PCA score plot for dataset 1 (HT, MT and reference drugs) is
shown in Figure 9.

Figure 9 PCA score
plot for HT (yellow), MT (green), and reference drugs
(brown). Three marine derived anticancer reference drugs are
R12 (Ara-C), R17 (eribulin), and R32 (trabectedin). H60 corresponds
to smenthiazole A.

In the left upper and
lower quadrant of the score plot, 25 reference
drugs were grouped accounting for 74% and the rest co-exist with other
marine metabolites. The four reference drugs spread over the right
upper quadrant area which resulted from a higher mass (>1000);
mass is one of the parameters resulting in the clear separation of
the two groups. Except smenothiazole A (H60), no other marine metabolite
was observed in the major group of reference drugs (brown). Out of
three marine-derived reference anticancer drugs, R12 (marked R12 =
Ara-C) falls into the group of 25 reference drugs (Brown), whereas
the other two (marked R32 = trabectedin, marked R17 = eribulin) co-exist
with other marine derived cytotoxic metabolites. Interestingly, eribulin
was present in the group of marine metabolites and completely separated
from other reference drugs. Three aggregated sub space groups (circled
in red color) were observed and interestingly two reference drugs
(R18-etoposide in the top and R17-eribulin in the bottom) were present
in the aggregated sub space.

The score plot from the PCA analysis
performed on HT and reference
drugs is shown in Figure 10. The separation of two groups could be clearly observed and
85% of the reference drugs were seen on the left side of the red line.
Two marine derived reference drugs (R12-Ara-C and R32-trabectedin)
were grouped with a majority of the reference drugs. In the left side,
29 HT metabolites were present; still there was no complete mixing
of reference drugs and HT metabolites. Interestingly, smenthiazole
B (H69) and smenthiazole A (H60) were observed to closer to reference
drug group compared to other marine metabolites.

Figure 10 PCA score plot for HT
marine metabolites (yellow) and the marketed
anticancer drugs (green). Three marine derived reference drugs are
R12 (Ara-C), R17 (eribulin), and R32 (trabectedin).

The score plot from the PCA analysis on moderately
cytotoxic marine
metabolites and the reference drugs is shown in Figure 11. Most of the (76%) reference
drugs were observed in the upper left quadrant of the plot. Similar
to earlier PCA results, two marine-derived anticancer reference
drugs (R12-Ara-C, R32-trabectedin) were observed with the other reference
drugs. Majority of cytotoxic marine metabolites were clustered
around the center of the plot. Eight cytotoxic marine metabolites
circled in orange color [jasplakinolide J (M29), jasplakinolide M
(M30), jasplakinolide Q (M31), marthiapeptide A (M50), microcystin-YR
(M52), pipestelide A (M72), virenamide B (M104), and virenamide C
(M105), reference drugs: daunorubicin (R14), doxorubicin (R16), etoposide
(R18), irinotecan (R23), and methotrexate (R27)] co-existed with reference
drugs.

anticancer drugs (green). Three marine derived anticancer reference
drugs are R12 (Ara-C), R17 (eribulin), and R32 (trabectedin).

Successful drug design must address
structural, ADMET aspects for
a drug candidate to become a marketable drug by any pharmaceutical
company. Oral availability is governed by the log P of a drug and it has an impact on the effective serum concentration,
eventually affecting the required efficacy at the target site. Majority
of marketed anticancer drugs (88%) are highly hydrophilic having log P below 5 possessing excellent oral availability, whereas
marine-based cytotoxic metabolites (HT and MT) are highly hydrophobic,
resulting in poor oral availability. In the case of mass, about 62%
of marketed anticancer drugs complied with Lipinski rule of five (0–500);
this deviation is more pronounced with cytotoxic marine metabolites.
TPSA compliance with Lipinski’s rule is higher (64%) for marketed
anticancer drugs as compared to other two categories (21–30%).
Drug candidates exhibit poor absorption when their TPSA is higher
than 140 Å2, which is benchmarked for marketed drugs.32−34 TPSA has a positive correlation with mass and the molecules with
a mass higher than 500 are observed to have TPSA beyond the range
of 0–140. Compliance with Lipinski’s rule of five for
a total number of rotatable bonds and H-bond donors for cytotoxic marine
metabolites is high and matched with reference drugs.

The comparison
of cytotoxic marine metabolites clustered with
reference drugs in the dendrogram obtained from HCA showed that many
scaffolds of cytotoxic marine metabolites have a high degree
of similarity with reference anticancer drugs. Bleomycin (R8)–largamides-E-F,
degarelix (R15)–koshikamide A2 (M36), erubulin (R17)–piperazimycins,
vinblastine (R33)–diazonamide (H18), anastrozole (R4)–smenothiazole
B (H69), and tamoxifen (R30)–virenamides B-C (M104, M105) are
good cases of structural scaffold homology. Apart from structural
scaffolds, the placement and topology of functional scaffolds in the
molecule is important for bioactivity and the selection of function
scaffold depends on the protein target in the cell. The PCA results
suggest a clear distinction between the reference anticancer drugs
and the cytotoxic marine metabolites. The raw marine cytotoxic
metabolites have to undergo modifications to reach the anticancer
drug space. When PCA was run on HT and reference drugs, a sizable
number of HT metabolites grouped with reference drugs. Smenothiazoles
A and B (H60, H69) merged into the reference anticancer drugs
space (Figure 10).
Hence, it offers optimistic picture on cytotoxic marine metabolites
in the journey to become a successful drug candidate.

Molecular
engineering on marine cytotoxic metabolites by applying
de novo drug design principles may possibly remove the unnecessary
hydrophobic group or fragment from marine-based cytotoxic metabolites.
In this process, reduction with mass may optimize the factors such
as mass, log P, and TPSA to improve the drug-like
properties. In this process, the structural and functional scaffolds
of the candidate should be retained for its biological activity.

Conclusions
Analysis of five molecular descriptors (log P,
mass, TPSA, number of rotatable bonds, and H-bond donors) for reference
anticancer drugs and cytotoxic marine metabolites showed that
cytotoxic marine metabolites violated Lipinski’s rule
of five with respect to mass and TPSA. The HCA results indicate that
there are cytotoxic marine metabolites having structural scaffold
homology with reference anticancer drugs. PCA results pointed
out that cytotoxic marine metabolites have not reached the drug
status in their current form. Necessary chemical modifications on
cytotoxic marine metabolites controlling mass, log P, and TPSA without disturbing structural and functional scaffolds
will result in more drug-like candidates for the chemotherapy route
in the future.

Methods
Cytotoxic marine metabolites
from cyanobacterial species were
collected from the cyanobacterial database.35 For sponges and other creatures (mollusk, ascidian, sea hare etc),
a list of cytotoxic marine metabolites was obtained from excellent
reviews.36−39 Each marine source was divided into two categories—highly
cytotoxic (Table 3)
(picomolar to 100 nM) and moderately cytotoxic (Table 4) (101 nM to 15 μM). Highly and moderately
cytotoxic groups had 69 and 109 metabolites, respectively. Thirty
four currently marketed and widely used anticancer drugs, which include
three agents from the marine origin, were benchmarked against the
marine cytotoxic metabolites (Table 5).

Marketed
anticancer drugs were selected from all categories such
as alkylating agents, antitumor-antibiotics, antimetabolites, microtubule
inhibitors, DNA linking agents, and hormones. Furthermore, three recently
FDA/EMA approved anticancer drugs from marine sources were included
in the reference list of anticancer drugs. Five molecular descriptors
(log P, mass, number of rotatable bonds, TPSA, and
the number of hydrogen bond donors) were calculated using the Molinspiration
software from Molinspiration Chemoinformatics for a comparison study
on Lipinski’s rule of five between marine metabolites and the
marketed reference drugs. The initial cutoff was set for molecular
parameters adhering to Lipinski’s rule of five obtained from
the relevant literature. The data was analyzed using an Excel spreadsheet.

For multivariate analysis, 73 molecular descriptors were derived
from the CDK molecular descriptor calculator. All the molecular descriptors
for all three group sets are provided in the Supporting Information.

Cluster
Analysis
HCA was executed using the Orange software (version
3.15.0) developed by Bioinformatics Lab at the University of Ljubljana,
Slovenia, in collaboration with the open source community.40 Furthermore, Ward’s method was used for
HCA.

Principal
Component Analysis
PCA was executed using SPSS25 statistics
from IBM that were run on three data sets. The first data set had
highly cytotoxic elements (HT-69), moderately cytotoxic elements (MT-109),
and the 34 reference drugs. The second and third data sets had HT
and MT candidates along with 34 reference drugs.

Scaffold
Analysis
Scaffold analysis was performed using the Marvin
sketch 18.20 module from ChemAxon software solutions. The Bemis–Murcko
loose framework was selected for the extraction of scaffolds for a
given molecule.
