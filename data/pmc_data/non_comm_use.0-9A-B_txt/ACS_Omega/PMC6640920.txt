2-(2-Bromovinyl)benzimidazoles
and 2-(2-bromophenyl)benzimidazoles
react with cyanamide by microwave irradiation in dimethylformamide
in the presence of a catalytic amount of CuI along with a base to
give the corresponding benzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-c]pyrimidin-1-amines
and benzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-c]quinazolin-6-amines,
respectively, in moderate to good yields. 2-(2-Bromophenyl)indoles
also react with cyanamide under similar conditions to afford indolo[1,2-c]quinazolin-6-amines. The reaction pathway seems to proceed
via a sequence such as intermolecular C–N coupling, C–N
formative cyclization, and tautomerization.

Introduction
Besides a class of
homonuclear N-heterocyclic compounds, their
N-fused hybrid structures frequently exhibit characteristic biological
activities that are not shown in each homonuclear scaffold. Thus,
many synthetic methods for such hybrid structures have been developed
and tested for biological activities.1 It
is known that benzimidazole-fused pyrimidines, benzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidines, also exhibit diverse biological activities
and fluorescent properties (Scheme 1, A).2−4 However, in contrast
to the well-known synthetic methods and biological activities for
benzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidines, those for benzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-c]pyrimidines are relatively rare (Scheme 1, B). It is reported that such
a scaffold can be synthesized by the initial addition of 2-cyanomethylbenzimidazole
to trichloroacetonitrile and the condensation of the resulting adduct
with ethyl orthoformate.5 Goekjian and
co-workers have demonstrated that a series of functionalized benzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-c]pyrimidines can also be prepared by aza-Graebe–Ullmann
coupling and palladium-catalyzed Buchwald–Hartwig coupling
protocols starting from 4,6-dichloropyrimidine and benzotriazole,
thus showing activity against anaplastic lymphoma kinase.6 The course of our continuing studies aiming to
develop a new protocol for transition-metal-catalyzed coupling and
cyclization reactions led us to seek for a new synthetic method for
benzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-c]pyrimidines.7 This report describes copper-catalyzed coupling and cyclization
of 2-(2-bromovinyl)benzimidazoles with cyanamide, leading to a class
of benzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-c]pyrimidines under microwave
irradiation (Scheme 2).8,9 To the best of our knowledge, two reports are found
for the synthesis of N-fused hybrid scaffolds using cyanamide. Fu
et al. have shown that 2-bromo-N-(2-halophenyl)benzamides
and N-(2-halophenyl)propiolamides are coupled and
cyclized with cyanamide in the presence of a copper catalyst along
with a ligand to form benzimidazo[2,1-b]quinazolin-12(6H)-ones and benzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4(10H)-ones, respectively (Scheme 3).10 The present
work shows another example for the synthesis of N-fused hybrid scaffolds
using cyanamide.

Results and Discussion
Treatment
of 2-(2-bromocyclohex-1-en-1-yl)-1H-benzo[d]imidazole (1a) with 2 equiv of cyanamide
(2) in dimethylformamide (DMF) in the presence of a catalytic
amount of CuI (10 mol %) and K2CO3 at 100 °C
for 30 min under microwave irradiation (100 W of initial power) afforded
1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-c]quinazolin-6-amine
(3a) in 51% yield (Table 1, entry 1) with incomplete conversion of 1a. Prolonging the reaction time up to 1 h was needed for the effective
formation of 3a with complete conversion of 1a; however, the reaction was accompanied by several unidentifiable
side products (Table 1, entry 2).a,b The reaction temperature was also critical for the effective formation
of 3a, and the yield raised with the increase in temperature
up to 100 °C (Table 1, entries 2–4, 14, and 16). When used with K2CO3 as a base and DMF as a solvent, copper salts such
as CuCl, CuBr, and Cu(OAc)2·H2O showed
lower catalytic activities than did CuI (Table 1, entries 5–7). Performing the reaction
using copper powder combined with l-proline and copper powder
resulted in lower yield of 3a (Table 1, entries 8 and 9).c The reaction also proceeded in the presence of other bases such
as NaOAc, KOH, NaOtBu, and Cs2CO3 in combination with CuI and DMF, but the yield of 3a was lower than that when K2CO3 was
employed (Table 1,
entries 10–13). However, an activity similar to that of K2CO3 was observed with K3PO4 (Table 1, entry 14).
Here again, further addition of l-proline gave no change
in the yield of 3a (Table 1, entry 15). Among the solvents examined in combination
with CuI and K3PO4, DMF was found to be of choice (Table 1, entries 14 and 17–19).
No expected product was observed in the absence of copper catalyst,
and 1a was recovered almost completely (Table 1, entries 20–23).

a Reaction conditions: 1a (0.3 mmol), 2a (0.6 mmol), Cu catalyst (0.03

W of initial power), 1 h, unless otherwise stated.

After the reaction
conditions had been optimized, various 2-(2-bromovinyl)benzimidazoles 1 were subjected to the reaction with cyanamide 2 to investigate the reaction scope, and several representative results
are summarized in Table 2. The six-membered 2-(2-bromovinyl)benzimidazoles (1b and 1c) reacted with 2 to give the corresponding
benzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-c]pyrimidin-1-amines (3b and 3c), irrespective of the presence of the
methyl and phenyl substituents on 1b and 1c. The coupling and cyclization with 1d having a dimethyl
substituent on the benzimidazole moiety also proceeded to give the
corresponding benzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-c]pyrimidin-1-amine 3d. With cyclic 2-(2-bromovinyl)benzimidazoles 1e–h having various ring sizes, the corresponding coupled and cyclized
products, benzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-c]pyrimidin-1-amines 3e–h, were also formed, as expected, in the range of
57–83% yields. Lower reaction yield, not yet explained, was
observed with 1e. For testing the effect of the position
of bromide and benzimidazole groups on benzo-fused 2-(2-bromovinyl)benzimidazoles, 1i and 1j were employed. The coupling and cyclization
took place irrespective of the position, and both cases are accompanied
by the dehydrogenation of benzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-c]pyrimidin-1-amines initially formed by the coupling and cyclization
of 1i and 1j with 2 under the
employed conditions. The coupling and cyclization product 3i formed from 1i was partially dehydrogenated to 3i′, whereas the product from 1j was completely
dehydrogenated to 3j. Such a similar dehydrogenation
was observed by our recent reports on copper-catalyzed coupling and
cyclization of β-bromo-α,β-unsaturated carboxylic
acids with terminal alkynes and palladium-catalyzed carbonylative
cyclization of 2-(2-bromovinyl)benzimidazoles.12 The reaction of acyclic 2-(2-bromovinyl)benzimidazole 1k with 2 also afforded the coupled and cyclized
product 3k; however, the yield was lower than that when
cyclic 2-(2-bromovinyl)benzimidazoles were used. Similar treatment
of 2-(2-bromoaryl)benzimidazoles 1l–n and 2-(2-bromoaryl)imidazole 1o with 2 under the employed conditions also
afforded the coupling and cyclization products 3l–o in 69–85% yields. It is known that benzimidazole- and imidazole-fused
quinazolines, benzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-c]quinazolines
and imidazo[1,2-c]quinazolines, have a wide spectrum
of biological activities and act as commercial drugs.13

Table 2 Scope of Coupling and Cyclization
Reactiona
a Reaction conditions: 1 or 4a (0.3 mmol), 2 (0.6 mmol),
CuI (0.03
mmol), K3PO4 (0.6 mmol), DMF (3 mL), 100 °C
(with 1), 130 °C (with 4), 1 h, under
microwave irradiation (100 W of initial power).

The present protocol can be extended
to the reaction with 2-(2-bromophenyl)-1H-indoles 4 (Table 2).
Similar treatment of 2-(2-bromophenyl)-1H-indole
(4a) with 2 under the
optimized conditions shown in Table 1 produced indolo[1,2-c]quinazolin-6-amine
(5a) in 47% yield. However, further tuning with the reaction
temperature resulted in an increased yield of 5a (73%
yield at 130 °C). From the reaction of several 2-(2-bromophenyl)-1H-indoles 4b–d with 2,
the corresponding coupled and cyclized indolo[1,2-c]quinazolin-6-amines 5b–d were also invariably
produced irrespective of straight and branched alkyl chains on the
indole moiety. It is also known that indole-fused quinazolines, indolo[1,2-c]quinazolines, exhibit biological activities such as antibacterial
and antifungal properties.14

Although
no additional experimental efforts for the reaction pathway
were performed, the reaction seems to proceed via an initial formation
of intermediate 6 by copper-catalyzed Ullmann-type coupling
between 1 (or 4) and 2 (Scheme 4).15 This is followed by the intramolecular addition of N–H
to CN to form 7, which triggers tautomerization to give
product 3. The following experimental observation is
worth noting as evidence for the formation of intermediate 6. We confirmed that a similar treatment of 2-(2-bromophenyl)-1-methyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazole (8) with 2 under the employed conditions afforded C–N-coupled
product 9 in 78% yield (Scheme 5, see the Supporting Information). A similar pathway has already been proposed in
copper-catalyzed coupling and cyclization reactions using cyanamide.10,16

Conclusions
It has been shown that 2-(2-bromovinyl)benzimidazoles
and their
analogs are coupled and cyclized with cyanamide under microwave irradiation
in the presence of CuI to give a class of N-fused hybrid scaffolds,
benzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-c]pyrimidin-1-amines and their
analogs. The present reaction provides a new method for synthesizing
several N-fused hybrid heterocycles from readily available starting
compounds.

Experimental Section
General Information
1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 500 and 125 MHz,
respectively, in
DMSO-d6 or CDCl3. Melting points
were determined on a microscopic melting point apparatus. High-resolution
mass data were recorded using electron ionization (HRMS-EI, magnetic
sector-electric sector double-focusing mass analyzer) at the Korea
Basic Science Center, Daegu, Korea. All microwave reactions (CEM,
Discover LabMate) were carried out in a sealed tube (5 mL), and the
reaction temperature was maintained by an external infrared sensor. The
isolation of pure products was carried out via thin-layer (a glass
plate coated with Kieselgel 60 GF254, Merck) chromatography
(TLC). The starting 2-(2-bromovinyl)benzimidazoles and their analogs
were prepared by literature procedures.17−19 Commercially available
organic and inorganic compounds were used without further purification.

General Procedure for the Synthesis of 3
A
10 mL microwave reaction tube was charged with 1 (0.3
mmol) and 2 (0.025 g, 0.6 mmol) together with CuI (0.006
g, 0.03 mmol), K3PO4 (0.127 g, 0.6 mmol), and
DMF (3 mL). The reaction mixture was heated to 100 °C for 1 h
by microwave irradiation at 100 W initial power. The mixture was then
cooled to room temperature and filtered through a short silica gel
column (ethyl acetate) to remove inorganic components. Removal of
the solvent left a crude mixture that was separated by TLC (dichloromethane/MeOH
= 19:1) to give 3. Except for known 3l,20 all new products were characterized spectroscopically.

a The yield of 3a was considerably
affected by the molar ratio of 2 to 1a.
The yield gradually increased from 47% ([2]/[1a] = 1.0), to 60% ([2]/[1a] = 1.5), and
to 77% ([2]/[1a] = 2.0).

b Similar treatment of 1a (0.3 mmol)
with 2 (0.6 mmol) in DMF (3 mL) in the presence
of CuI (0.03 mmol) and K2CO3 (0.6 mmol) under
usual heating method (screw-capped vial, 100 °C for 24 h) afforded 3a in 49% yield with 68% conversion of 1a.

c It is known that Cu catalyst combined
with amino acid effectively catalyzes C–N cross-coupling reactions.
