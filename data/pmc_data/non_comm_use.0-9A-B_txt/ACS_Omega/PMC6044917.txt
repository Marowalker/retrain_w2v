Overexpression of c-MYC oncogene is associated
with cancer pathology. Expression of c-MYC is regulated
by the G-quadruplex structure formed in the G-rich segment of nuclease
hypersensitive element (NHE III1), that is, “Pu27”, which is localized in the promoter region.
Ligand-induced stabilization of the Pu27 structure
has been identified as a novel target for cancer therapeutics. Here,
we have explored the library of synthetic compounds against the predefined
binding site of Pu27. Three compounds were selected
based on the docking analyses; they were further scrutinized using
all atom molecular dynamics simulations in an explicit water model.
Simulated trajectories were scrutinized for conformational stability
and ligand binding free energy estimation; essential dynamic behavior
was determined using principal component analysis. One of the molecules,
“TPP (1-(3-(4-(1,2,3-thiadiazol-4-yl)phenoxy)-2-hydroxypropyl)-4-carbamoylpiperidinium)”,
with the best results was considered for further evaluation. The theoretical
observations are supported well by biophysical analysis using circular
dichroism, isothermal titration calorimetry, and high-resolution NMR
spectroscopy indicating association of TPP with Pu27. The in vitro studies were then translated into c-MYC overexpression in the T47D breast cancer cell line. Biological evaluation
through the MTT assay, flow cytometric assay, RT-PCR, and reporter
luciferase assay suggests that TPP downregulates the expression of c-MYC oncogene by arresting its promoter region. In silico
and in vitro observations cumulatively suggest that the novel skeleton
of TPP could be a potential anticancer agent by stabilizing the G-quadruplex
formed in the Pu27 and consequently downregulating
the expression of c-MYC oncogene. Derivation of new
molecules on its skeleton may confer anticancer therapeutics for the
next generation.

Introduction
Health problems due
to cancer are increasing worldwide; according
to global demographic characteristics, more than 20 million new cancer
cases per year are expected by 2025.1 Limitations
in earlier chemotherapeutic cancer treatments such as severe side
effects, toxicity, and the emergence of resistance have been overcome
by incorporating specificity toward cancer targets. Targeted therapy
has proven to be an efficient alternative whereby molecular targets
responsible for addictions, dependencies, and vulnerabilities of cancer
cells are identified and treated with either an immunotherapy approach
or with small molecular chemical entities.1−4 Some of the successes in targeted
therapy are as follows: inhibition of EGFR by gefitinib and erlotinib,
inhibition of c-kit and PDGFR by imatinib, inhibition
of VEGFR by sorafenib, inhibition of protein kinase ALK by crizotinib,
inhibition of BRAF by vemurafenib, and so forth.1,4 Recently,
Cifuentes et al. studied the interaction of the TTP–DMβCD
inclusion complex in targeting ctDNA.5 One of the unattained cancer targets is c-MYC oncogene;6 multiple mutations and overexpression
of c-MYC are observed in carcinomas of the breast,
colon, and cervix, and in osteosarcomas, glioblastomas, and myeloid
leukemias.7c-MYC plays
a key role in regulating the cell cycle; it assists in cell proliferation;
however, in collaboration with n-MYC, it inhibits
the differentiation of cells, thus maintaining the pluripotency and
self-renewal of cells and causing malignancy.7−12 Thus, inhibition of c-MYC has been considered as
an approach for anticancer therapy. c-MYC can be
targeted in three ways; (i) inhibition of c-MYC–MAX dimerization, (ii) inhibition of binding of the dimer
with E-box, and (iii) transcriptional regulation of c-MYC by arresting the G-quadruplex formed in its promoter region7 and inhibition of binding of the respective transcription
factors with Pu27.13 Here,
we have adopted the third mode for downregulation of c-MYC expression, that is, stabilization of the respective quadruplex
using small molecules. The mode of arresting the G-quadruplex structure
via small molecules has been investigated broadly over the few last
decades,14−16 opening a new arena in modern day therapeutic approaches.

“Nuclease hypersensitivity element” (NHE III1) consists of a 27-bp long purine-rich noncoding sequence
named Pu27, which is located at the upstream site
of the P1 promoter of c-MYC. G-quadruplex formation
in the guanine-rich strand of Pu27 results in silencing
of the c-MYC oncogene, whereas in the active state
it adopts a duplex secondary structure, thus NHE III1 regulates
the transcription of c-MYC through the structural
transitions of Pu27.17−22 Natural compounds and some synthetic chemical compounds have been
studied for their stabilization effect on the G-quadruplex structure
of Pu27 and the further inhibition of expression
of the c-MYC oncogene.23−30 Quarfloxin is the only quadruplex binding agent that has entered
phase II clinical trials for its anticancer activity;31 it was also found to inhibit c-MYC expression
by binding to Pu27.32 Other
chemical entities have been found to be transcriptional inhibitors
of c-MYC through quadruplex interaction such as the
perylene derivative PIPER (N,N′-bis(2-(1-piperidino)ethyl)-3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic
acid diimide),33 the cationic porphyrine
derivative TmPyP4,34,35 acridine derivatives,36 quindoline derivatives,27,37 the FDA-approved drug, methylene blue,38 and so forth. The presence of two single-nucleotide loops and one
two-nucleotide loop in one of the quadruplex conformers of Pu27 provides the stability to the overall secondary structure
in simulated conditions thus allowing the utilization of an in silico
approach in studying the Pu27–ligand interaction.39−41 Nasiri et al. screened a fragment library against the promoter region
of c-MYC by means of in silico methods and further
validated the results using biophysical techniques and biological
assays; they proposed some small fragments such as the amino–indole
motif and amino–benzodioxan skeleton binding in the groove
region as a starting point for further drug design.39 Similarly, Kang et al. determined hit molecules against
the promoter region of c-MYC oncogene based on virtual
screening, molecular docking, and a molecular dynamics study, and
further analyzed their interaction properties using biophysical and
biological approaches.23 Also, Rocca et
al. determined novel natural alkaloid derivatives with a dual binding
property toward h-telo and c-MYC promoter quadruplex by means of virtual screening, molecular docking,
and molecular dynamics simulations.28 Shan
et al. utilized a similar in silico approach in screening molecules
that could disrupt the binding of NM23H2 with Pu27 resulting in the downregulation of c-MYC expression.13 Lee et al. indentified the natural product Fonsecin
B as a c-MYC stabilizing agent via a high-throughput
virtual screening method.42 In our previous
study, we followed the in silico approach for screening the natural
drug database with chelerythrine-like molecules and determined the
pharmacophoric features essential for stabilizing the quadruplex formed
in Pu27.43

In the
current study, a library of small compounds has been screened
based on their druglikeness using a virtual screening method and further
screened for their probable binding capacity toward the G-quadruplex
formed in Pu27 using molecular docking. The top three
best fitting molecules are further studied for their binding characteristics
and stabilizing effect on Pu27 using all atom molecular
dynamics simulations in an explicit solvent model. On the basis of
the structural stability, essential dynamics properties, and binding
free energy estimations, one compound, TPP (1-(3-(4-(1,2,3-thiadiazol-4-yl)phenoxy)-2-hydroxypropyl)-4-carbamoylpiperidinium), with promising results is taken for further
scrutiny. Biophysical techniques such as circular dichroism (CD) and
isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) confirm the binding of TPP
with Pu27. NMR spectroscopy offers the atomistic
details of the binding pattern of TPP, further validating the simulation
results. The postulation that the screened compound with a binding
phenomenon toward Pu27 can downregulate the expression
of c-MYC is established by further ex vivo assessment
of c-MYC overexpression in the T47D breast cancer
cell line. The flow cytometric assay confirms the killing effect of
TPP over cancer cells, reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and the reporter
luciferase assay imply that TPP arrests the quadruplex structure and
reduces the expression of c-MYC oncogene. Thus, here
we have combined the stepwise protocol of computer aided drug design
with in vitro and ex vivo approaches to obtain a novel lead molecule
that can act as a c-MYC inhibitor. Further optimization
of TPP may offer a promising anticancer agent.

Materials and Methods
Virtual
Screening and Molecular Docking
Virtual screening
workflow available in Maestro44 was utilized
for screening 54 645 chemical compounds obtained from the Maybridge
database. The stepwise screening of chemical compounds is as shown
in Figure 1. After
stepwise refinements, 88 589 conformations were used for further
molecular docking.

Figure 1 Virtual screening protocol followed in stepwise filtering
of chemical
compounds is given in the flow chart format. Selected compounds are
represented in the two-dimensional (2D) format. Respective docking
scores, IUPAC naming, and Maybridge database IDs are given below the
structures.

The initial model structure
of the G-quadruplex formed in Pu27 was kept the same
as that reported in the previous
study.43 It was built over the template
of the NMR solution structure (PDB-ID 2A5P)25 using Maestro45 and further details are as documented previously.43 On the basis of the information provided in
the literature,23,25,28,43 the 5′ end of Pu27 was taken as the ligand binding site. A grid with an inner box (10
Å) and an outer box (30 Å) was built at the 5′ end
of the quadruplex structure. Screening of compounds was done with
three-step molecular docking using Grid based Ligand Docking with
energetics (GLIDE);46 (i) all compounds
were docked using HTVS protocol and the top 10% of the compounds were
screened, (ii) compounds screened through HTVS were re-docked using
SP protocol and the top 10% of the compounds were screened, (iii)
compounds screened through SP were re-docked using XP protocol. Three
compounds with a favorable docking score were taken as a lead for
further study. Their IUPAC names, database codes, and respective 2D
structures are shown in Figure 1. In further discussion, they are named TPP, RJC, and AWO.

Molecular Dynamics Simulations
Four molecular systems
termed unbound-Pu27, Pu27–TPP
complex, Pu27–RJC complex, and Pu27–AWO complex were considered for simulation analysis. All
atom molecular dynamics simulations in explicit water were conducted
using the simulation program AMBER11.47 Two K+ ions were explicitly placed into the central region
of the quartet channels using the xleap module of AMBER11. Force field
parameters for ligand molecules were generated in the Antechamber48 module of AMBER with AM1-BCC charges. Ions were
parameterized using a General Amber Force Field (GAFF)49 and the quadruplex segment was parameterized
using the ff99SB50 and parmbsc051 force fields of AMBER11. Sodium ions were incorporated
to neutralize the charges, and the systems were submerged within an
8 Å TIP3PBOX water model;52 further
simulation stages were the same as that in a prior report.53 Minimization was conducted in two steps using
a combination of the steepest descent and conjugate gradient method;
initially, water molecules and ions were minimized constraining the
biomolecule, and afterwards, the whole system was minimized. Systems
were gradually heated to 300 K within 50 ps, and macroscopic factors
were equilibrated for 1 ns prior to production. A final production
run of 50 ns was conducted in NPT ensemble at 300 K temperature and
1 atm pressure and a calculation was performed for each 2 fs step
size. Temperature and pressure was regulated using a Langevin thermostat-barostat,
and the SHAKE algorithm was applied for bond length corrections.54−56 Long range electrostatic interactions above the cut off distance
of 12 Å were optimized with the Particle Mesh Ewald method (0.1
nm grid space of FFT grid).57 A trajectory
was formed with the atomic coordinates saved at each 10 ps time step.
Trajectories were further analyzed using the CPPTRAJ module of AMBER,
VMD, PyMol, and Chimera tools.58−61

The binding free energy of each ligand was
estimated over the entire simulation run by extracting frames at each
500 ps. Both the MMPBSA and MMGBSA approaches were used, as MMPBSA
can provide energies close to experimental observations and MMGBSA
offers comparative values thus allowing ranking of multiple ligands.62−67 Estimations were based on the following mathematical functions  where ΔGbinding is the binding
free energy and GDNA+ligand complex, GDNA, and Gligand represent the free energies of the respective states.

The
free energy of each state was calculated as follows      where EMM is the
molecular mechanical energy, GPB/GB is
the polar contribution toward solvation energy, Poisson–Boltzmann
(PB) or Generalized Born (GB) method used for calculations, GSA are the contributions from nonpolar terms
toward solvation energy, Eele is the electrostatic
energy, EvdW is the van der Waals energy, Eint is the internal energy (bond, angle, and
torsional angle energy) SASA is the solvent accessible surface area,
γ is the surface tension proportionality constant (0.0072 kcal/mol/Å2), and b is the free energy of nonpolar solvation
for a point solute (0 kcal/mol).

In this tool, SASA is computed
by molsurf using linear combinations
of pairwise overlaps (LCPO), the solute atoms were taken as a probe
sphere of 1.4 Å. Binding free energy calculations were averaged
over 100 frames taken at the interval of 500 ps over the production
run of 50 ns.

Biophysical Techniques and Materials
TPP was purchased
from Thermo Fisher Scientific India. Potassium phosphate monobasic,
potassium phosphate dibasic, and potassium chloride were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich. The commercially synthesized oligonucleotides, Pu27 and Pu24 were purchased from from
Eurofins Genomics India Pvt Ltd.

Pu27-5′-TGGGGAGGGTGGGGAGGGTGGGGAAGG-3′

Pu24-5′-TGAGGGTGGGGAGGGTGGGGAAGG-3′

10 mM phosphate buffer containing 100 mM KCl at pH 7.0 was prepared
in millipore water. It was autoclaved and filtered prior to use. Pu27 and Pu24 were dissolved in the same
buffer, annealed at 90 °C, cooled to room temperature, and stored
at 4 °C for further use. The molecule TPP was dissolved in 100%
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), the DMSO concentration was, however, kept
below 1% in all experiments.

CD
The CD spectra of Pu27 and the Pu27–TPP complex were monitored
using a Jasco 815
spectrometer. Pu27 (20 μM) was dissolved in
10 mM phosphate buffer containing 100 mM KCl at pH 7.0. CD titrations
of Pu27 with increasing concentration of TPP were
carried out at 25 °C using a cuvette of 0.1 cm path length. To
attain equilibration and ensure complete complex formation, each spectrum
was recorded after 5 min of addition of TPP. Each spectrum was scanned
from 220 to 310 nm with a scan speed of 100 nm/min. The data interval
was set at 1 nm with an average of 3 scans. All spectra were base
line corrected. To check the stabilization effect of TPP over Pu27, CD melting experiments were carried out. Pu27 (20 μM) was annealed separately in 10 mM phosphate buffer
containing 100 mM KCl at pH 7.0 and water (K+ < 1.5
mM) to find out the Tm of unbound-Pu27.
To conduct the melting of the Pu27–TPP complex
both in phosphate buffer containing 100 mM KCl and in water, TPP was
mixed with Pu27 in a 3:1 molar ratio. The thermal
melting was recorded from 20 to 95 °C for the Pu27–TPP complex in phosphate buffer and from 20 to 90 °C
for the Pu27–TPP complex in water. The temperature
interval was 5 °C with a ramp rate of 2.5 °C min–1. The sample was equilibrated for 3.0 min at each temperature before
data acquisition.

NMR Spectroscopy
A Bruker AVANCE
III 500 MHz NMR spectrometer
equipped with a 5 mm SMART probe was used to monitor the NMR spectra
at 298 K. Acquisition and data processing were done using TopspinTMv3.1
software. The samples were dissolved in 10 mM phosphate buffer containing
100 mM KCl and 10 % D2O. Trimethylsilylpropanoic acid (TSP)
was used as an internal standard (0.0 ppm). An array of one-dimensional
proton spectra and proton-decoupled one-dimensional 31P
spectra were monitored with increasing concentration of TPP until
the peak started broadening employing the standard Bruker pulse programs
“zgesgp” and “zgpg30”, respectively. A
total of 512 scans were used with a spectral width of 20 ppm. To calculate
the rate of exchange of imino protons (Kex) of Pu24, two selective inversion recovery experiments
were performed, one for water and the other for imino protons, with
inversion recovery delays ranging from 0 to 3.5 s and 0 to 0.0125
s to compute the spin lattice rates, R1W and R1i, respectively. The water-selective
magnetization experiment was performed to calculate Kex using the following equation  where I0 and It are the peak intensities
of the imino proton
at zero and t delay/mixing time, respectively. The
detail of the pulse sequence used to commute Kex was described in detail in our previously published paper.68

ITC
An iTC200 Microcalorimeter was
used to conduct
ITC experiments at room temperature. TPP and Pu27 were degassed ahead of titration to make sure that no bubble formation
occurred. Pu27 (700 μM) was injected at an
interval of 180 s into a fixed volume of TPP (20 μM). A blank
experiment was performed by injecting the same concentration of Pu27 into the buffer solution without TPP to subtract the
heat of dilution when Pu27 interacts with the buffer.
The isotherm was analyzed with the help of in-built Origin 7.0 software.
The data points obtained were best fitted into a “one-site”
binding model. The thermodynamic parameters such as change in enthalpy
(ΔH), change in entropy (ΔS), and Gibbs free energy (ΔG) were calculated
using the following equation.  

Cell Culture and Treatment
Human
breast ductal carcinoma
cell line (T47D) and normal kidney epithelial cell line (NKE) were
cultured separately in complete Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM) (Himedia; AL007G) and RPMI-1640 (Himedia; AL120A) media,
respectively, supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 2 mM l-glutamine, 50 μg/mL gentamycin, 1% Pen-Strep, and 2.5
μg/mL Amphotericin B in a fully humidified CO2 incubator
(ESCO cell culture CO2 Incubator, Model no. CCL-1708-8-UV)
at 37 °C and 5% CO2.

MTT Assay
T47D
and NKE cells were subcultured in a
96-well microtiter plate at a density of 104 cells/well
in 100 μL of respective culture media and incubated in an ESCO
cell culture CO2 incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 24 h to ensure cell attachment. Cells were treated with
an increasing concentration gradient of TPP (1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40,
50 μM) for 24 h. After treatment, 10 μL of a 5 mg/mL solution
in phenol-free media of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) tetrazolium substrate was added to each well and incubated
for 4 h at 37 °C in the CO2 incubator. The resulting
violet formazan precipitate was solubilized in 100 μL of DMSO.
Absorbance for each sample was recorded at 570 nm in the 96-well microtiter
plate reader (Polar Star Optima, BMG Labtech) with a reference wavelength
of 650 nm. All of the assays were performed in six replicates, and
the DMSO-treated set was considered as a negative control to nullify
the cytotoxic effects of DMSO (as TPP was solubilized in DMSO). The
percentage cell viability was calculated as the percentage of MTT
absorption  

Flow Cytometry
T47D and NKE cells were individually
seeded into 6-well microtiter plates up to 70% confluency, at a density
of 1 × 106 cells per well in 2 mL of respective culture
media and allowed time for adherence. Cells were treated with an increasing
concentration (1–150 μM) of TPP. After 24 h of treatment,
cells were trypsinized and washed twice with 1× PBS at 3000 rpm
for 5 min at room temperature. The cell pellet was subjected to the
flow cytometric assays with a BD Pharmigen Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis
detection Kit (Catalog no. 556570). In brief, the cell pellet is re-suspended
in 100 μL of 1× binding buffer followed by incubation with
5 μL of Annexin V-FITC and 2 μL of PI under dark conditions
for 30 min and 15 min, respectively, at 4 °C. Finally, cell suspensions
were diluted with 400 μL of 1× binding buffer immediately
prior to the analysis in the BD FACS Verse Flow cytometer. Measurement
of individual sets was acquired at 1000 events with medium flow rate
and carried out in triplicate. DMSO-treated and 60 μM Etoposide
(known to induce apoptosis in cells)-treated cells69 were considered as negative and positive controls, respectively.
The gate was set based on the SSC (side scatter) versus FSC (forward
scatter) dot plot, and the resulting quadrants of the treated sets
reflect the fluorescence properties of the gated population only (Figures S15 and S16).

RT-PCR
T47D cells
were subcultured into 6-well microtiter
plates up to 70% confluency, at a density of 1 × 106 cells per well in 2 mL of DMEM media and allowed time for adherence.
Cells were treated with different concentrations (30, 35, and 40 μM)
of TPP. After 24 h of treatment, cells were scraped and washed twice
with 1× PBS at 3000 rpm for 5 min at room temperature. Total
RNA was isolated from both untreated and TPP treated T47D cells using
the TRIzol method (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) as per manufacturer’s
instructions. 2 μg of total RNA was processed for cDNA synthesis
and reverse transcribed using a Super MuLV RT Kit (Biobharati Life
Sciences Pvt. Ltd.). PCR reactions were optimized to 94 °C for
5 min, 45 amplification cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, the appropriate
annealing temperature for 45 s, 72 °C for 45 s, and a final extension
of 7 min at 72 °C followed by storage at 4 °C. The final
products were electrophoresed on 1.5% agarose gels and visualized
by ethidium bromide staining along with a 100 bp DNA ladder (Thermo
Scientific). Reactions were carried out in triplicate, and the housekeeping
gene GAPDH was used as an internal control to normalize
the variability in expression levels. Semiquantitative densitometric
analyses were performed to determine the relative mRNA expression
levels. PCR primers were designed using Primer-BLAST, NCBI, and analyzed
in OligoAnalyser 3.1-IDT. The forward and reverse primer sequences
and corresponding annealing temperatures are listed in Table 1.

confluency and transfected with 5 μg of reporter plasmid by
Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) using the manufacturer’s
protocol. After 30 h of transfection, cells were treated with TPP
(25, 35, and 40 μM). Luciferase assays were performed after
24 h of treatment using the Promega Luciferase Assay System (E1500)
and Multimode Microplate Reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as per
the manufacturer’s protocols. Transfection of each construct
was performed in triplicate. Readings were recorded for each experiment
and triplicates were averaged.

Results and Discussion
Analysis
of Molecular Docking
As seen in Table S1, the selected ligand molecules, through
virtual screening and molecular docking, fulfill the criteria for
druglikeness. All possess a negative docking score (better than chelerythrine43), and respective docked conformations are shown
in Figure S1. TPP forms polar interactions
with A15 and CH−π interactions with A6 and G14. RJC forms
polar interactions with A15 and G11 and π–π stacking
interactions with G14. AWO forms polar interactions with A15, G11,
and G9, and π–π stacking interactions with G11
and T10. Thus, the 5′ end bases are providing the binding site
for ligand molecules. These results are in correlation with our previous
findings;43 also, Kang et al. suggested
a similar binding pattern for small molecules interacting with Pu27.23 We further explored the
binding pattern of selected ligands using all atom molecular dynamics
simulations to overcome the limitations of docking in considering
the flexibility of receptor and ligand molecules. The results of this
are discussed further.

Root-Mean-Square Displacement (RMSD) Analysis
RMSD
analysis illustrates the deviation of the structure at a particular
time point from that of the reference frame. Here, we considered the
coordinates of the structure after the equilibration stage as the
reference frame, and RMSD is estimated over the entire 50 ns simulation
run using the formula  where N is the total number
of atoms under consideration and δ is the distance between two
positions of N pairs of equivalent atoms. Higher
deviation in the RMSD pattern indicates the flexible nature of a respective
structure and if the RMSD is converging to a certain steady value,
this implies the convergence of the structure to a stable conformation.

Backbone RMSD represents the integrity of an overall secondary
structure; as seen in Figure 2A, the Pu27–TPP complex possesses
the lowest backbone RMSD (∼2.0 Å), which is steady over
the entire simulation run. Unbound-Pu27 and the Pu27–AWO complex show unsteady RMSD, which fluctuates
around ∼3.0 Å. The Pu27–RJC complex
has the highest RMSD value, which fluctuates around ∼4.7 Å.
Thus, the backbone RMSD estimation suggests that the secondary structure
of Pu27 attains the most stable conformation when
it is in the bound form with the TPP molecule. 5′ end capping
bases (G5, A6, A15) provide the binding surface for ligands; in all
of the bound and unbound states, these bases are rigid (Figure 2B) with a steady pattern in
RMSD (<∼3.0 Å). In the Pu27–TPP
complex, 5′ end capping bases are stabilized to a greater extent,
as reflected in the small RMSD value (∼1.5 Å); also, in
unbound-Pu27 and the Pu27–AWO
complex, these bases are stabilized with RMSD within the range of
∼1.5 to ∼2.0 Å, whereas, in the presence of RJC,
the active site bases are fluctuating far from the initial conformation
(RMSD ∼ 2.2 Å). RMSD observations imply that TPP is effective
in stabilizing the binding site. The characteristic feature of the Pu27 structure, the “GAAG cap” at the 3′
end (G23, A24, A25, G26) (Figure 2C), and the core region of stacked guanines are found
to be rigid in all of the systems (Figure 2E) with lower RMSD values (∼1.5 Å).
As seen in the RMSD of the ligand molecule (Figure 2D), AWO is flexible as RMSD is fluctuating
around ∼2.0 Å; however, RJC and TPP are stabilized at
different ranges of RMSD values. TPP is stabilized around ∼1.0
Å for the initial 10 ns and for subsequent 10 ns steps it is
stabilized around ∼0.5 Å. During the last 30 ns simulation
run TPP has attained a steady RMSD of around ∼1.0 Å. Similar
to the RMSD pattern of TPP, the RMSD of RJC is also fluctuating between
∼0.5 and ∼1.0 Å. The flexibility of the ligands
is visible in the ensemble structure of the respective system (Figure 2F); TPP and RJC converge
to a steady conformation; however, AWO deviates. Thus, among all of
the ligand molecules, TPP is found to be effective in enhancing the
structural strength of Pu27 over that of its unbound
state.

complex (pink), Pu27–AWO complex (green)];

stacking, and (F) superimposed structure of coordinates taken at each
100 ps from last 1 ns trajectory of each system.

B-Factor Analysis
RMSD gives the average deviation
of the overall structure from the reference frame at each time point,
whereas the B-factor gives the average fluctuation of each atom from
the reference frame over the entire simulation run. This means RMSD
offers the conformational integrity over the entire structure and
B-factor offers the contribution of each atom toward the strength
and flexibility of the structure. Segment wise B-factors are determined
using the cpptraj58 module of AMBER using
the formula  Here, RMSF represents root-mean-square
fluctuation.

B-factor analysis (Figure 3A) suggests that the 5′ overhanging
nucleotide stretch
and loop regions are flexible and the guanines involved in core stacking
are rigid; these observations are in correlation with the RMSD data.
The B-factor of the bases involved in ligand binding and guanines
forming the first G-stack (G5, A6, G7, A15, G16, G20) shows variation
in different states (Figure 3B); in the Pu27–TPP complex these
bases are stabilized to a greater extent than that of the other states,
in the Pu27–RJC complex this region is highly
flexible, whereas in unbound-Pu27 and the Pu27–AWO complex these regions are moderately flexible.
Both the RMSD and B-Factor data confirm the stabilizing effect of
TPP over the ligand binding site. The B-factor of the 5′ overhanging
nucleotide stretch (Figure 3C) is found to be lowest in the Pu27–TPP complex, highest in the Pu27–RJC complex,
and moderate in both the unbound-Pu27 and Pu27–AWO complex systems. The flexibility of the
loop regions increases in the presence of ligand molecules over that
of the unbound state. The flexibility of Loop-1 is similar in the Pu27–TPP complex and the Pu27–AWO complex but in the Pu27–RJC complex it
is at a higher range (Figure 3D). G13 of Loop-2 is highly flexible (Figure 3E) in the Pu27–RJC
complex and in the Pu27–TPP complex whereas
G14 of Loop-2 is stabilized in the presence of TPP; visual analysis
confirms that TPP forms H–π interactions
with G13 thus affecting its flexibility, and G14 is stabilized due
to π–π stacking interactions with
G13 (refer to the video of simulated trajectory provided in the Supporting Information). Loop-3 (Figure 3F) is highly flexible in the Pu27–TPP complex but stabilized in the presence of
RJC and AWO.

Hydrogen Bond Analysis
Hydrogen bonds are determined
with the distance cut off between donor and acceptor group set to
3 Å and angle cut off set to 20°, “% hydrogen bond
occupancy” is calculated as the percentage of time that the
hydrogen bond is formed over the entire simulation time using VMD
software.59

During the simulation
run, TPP forms ∼2 hydrogen bonds with Pu27, whereas both RJC and AWO form only ∼1 hydrogen bond (Figure S2A). AWO, being flexible, does not intercalate
with the active site bases and it is highly exposed to the water molecules,
as illustrated by water shell analysis (Figure S2F), it forms nearly four hydrogen bonds with water molecules
(Figure S2B). However, TPP and RJC are
rigidly bound with the active site bases and further stabilized by
interacting with water molecules forming ∼3 and ∼1 hydrogen
bond interactions, respectively (Figure S2B). As shown in Figure S2G, TPP forms hydrogen
bonding interactions with G4, G11, and A15 with high occupancy values
and electrostatic interactions with A6, G11, and A15 (Figure S2D). Thus, polar interactions and hydrogen
bonding of TPP strengthen the wrapping of 5′ end bases with
overhanging stretch. TPP–Pu27 complexation
is well supported with solvent molecules. RJC shows poor hydrogen
bonding and forms polar interactions with G3, G4, and A15 (Figure S2E); however, unlike the Pu27–TPP complex, wrapping of the overhanging stretch over the 5′
end bases is lacking. AWO forms strong hydrogen bonding interactions
with G11 but its overall conformation is not stabilized in the binding
site, thus it is excluded from the evaluation of polar interactions.
The total number of water molecules in the inner (3.4 Å from
ligand) and outer shell (5 Å from ligand) of ligand molecules
are as illustrated in Figure S2F. In the Pu27–TPP complex, the total number of water molecules
in both the inner and outer shells is in a lower range than that of
the other two complex systems. Also, the numbers of total water molecules
fluctuate for TPP during the simulation run, unlike the RJC and AWO
complex systems that have a steady count of water molecules around
the ligands. This implies that binding of TPP is perturbing the structure
of the surrounding water molecules, which is absent in RJC and AWO.
Binding of TPP and RJC is majorly through interactions with the 5′
end bases; a similar interaction pattern has been reported in analysis
of alkaloid derivatives28 and some novel
ligands.23

The intramolecular interactions
of Pu27 in different
states are shown in (Figure S3). In the Pu27–TPP complex and unbound-Pu27, the 5′ end overhanging bases (T1, G2, G3, G4) are capping
over the first guanine stack (G7, G11, G16, G20), which is supported
by hydrogen bonding interactions among G2–G3 (Pu27–TPP complex), G2–G4 (Pu27–TPP complex), G4–A15 (Pu27–TPP complex), and G3–G4 (unbound-Pu27). Such interactions are absent
in the AWO and RJC complex systems. A–A-mismatch
(A6–A15) is a characteristic feature of the Pu27 structure, which is highly stabilized in the presence
of TPP and in the unbound state; however, it is weakened in the Pu27–RJC complex and Pu27–AWO complex. The guanines involved in core stacking are highly stabilized
through Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding in all of the systems, in the Pu27–AWO complex these base pairings are weakened
to a small extent at the third guanine stack, as reflected in the
reduced hydrogen bond occupancy (Figure S3). Hydrogen bond analyses clearly indicate that binding of TPP is
strengthening the secondary structure of quadruplex formed in Pu27 by means of enhancing occupancy of base pairing and
other hydrogen bonding interactions.

Water Density Map Analysis
and Ion Density Grid Analysis
Density maps of water molecules
and ions surrounding the quadruplex
were generated using the grid function of CPPTRAJ.58 A grid box of “100 Å × 100 Å ×
100 Å” was generated with a mesh size of 0.5 Å. The
occupancy of the oxygen atom of a water molecule and sodium ion at
each grid point was determined over the average coordinates of Pu27 recorded for the last 10 ns simulation run. The occupancy
of water or ion molecule represents the population of the respective
atom (oxygen in the case of water and Na+ in the case of
ion) that retains the same distance and angle (as present in the reference
frame) with that of the corresponding atoms of the quadruplex during
the trajectory period (10 ns) under consideration. Though the “simulation
time” term is not included in the function of density calculation,
it has been indirectly taken into consideration as the population
reflects the total number of times the particular condition is satisfied.
A denser contour represents the localization of a respective molecule
at the associated grid point for a longer duration and vice versa.
The generated XPLOR density maps were visualized in Chimera 1.9.61 The approach of correlating water density and
ion density with the structural properties of the G-quadruplex structure
has been applied in our previous studies.43,53,70

A denser water structure around the
macromolecule suggests rigidity of the respective region, whereas
a thin water structure is generally observed around the flexible regions.
As seen in Figure S4A, the water structure
is dense in all of the states of Pu27 reflecting
the strength of the overall secondary conformation. Pu27 in complex with the ligand attains a higher water density than that
of the unbound state thus indicating a stabilizing effect of the ligands
over the G-quadruplex structure. In the Pu27–TPP complex and Pu27–RJC complex, water molecules
are densely located in the groove region thus supporting the secondary
structure. Further, the flexible nature of the bases present in the
loop region is reflected by the deficiency of hydration. In the Pu27–AWO complex, the water structure is unsystematic,
loop bases are hydrated thus indicating their rigid nature, which
is in correlation with the B-factor analysis.

In the simulation
of the quadruplex, the repulsive forces generated
due to negative charges over the backbone phosphate atoms and partial
negative charges over the carbonyl oxygen atoms are counterbalanced
by the explicitly incorporated counterions. As illustrated in Figure S4B, core regions in all of the states
of Pu27 are stabilized by channeled K+ ions. In unbound-Pu27, the loop bases, A–A mismatch region, and GAG triad at the 3′
end are supported by counterions. The GAG triad is surrounded by ions
in all of the systems, but the rest of the ion structure varies. In
the Pu27–TPP complex, ions are centered over
the 5′ end, the overhanging stretch at the 5′ end is
surrounded by ions and scattered interactions of ions are found in
the backbone regions and some in the loop regions. In the Pu27–RJC complex, the A–A mismatch region
is in contact with ions, and the other regions show ion interactions
to a small extent. Similar to the water structure, the ion structure
in the Pu27–AWO complex is different from
the other states as Loop-1, the GAG triad, and external portion of
the ligand molecule are majorly surrounded by ion molecules.

Principal
Component Analysis and Conformational Behavior
The essential
dynamics responsible for the overall conformational
behavior of the quadruplex was determined using principal component
analysis (PCA). PCA assists in extracting the set of coordinate frames
that reflects the dynamic pattern of the macromolecule occurring in
the simulation run.71−76 All of the states of Pu27 were evaluated using
the PCASuite package.77 Each trajectory
of 50 ns length was divided into 5 subsections (10 ns each), and they
were processed using the PCAzip module for phosphodiester backbone
atoms. Noise due to oscillations and tumbling motions was eliminated
by a two step alignment; first, all of the frames were superimposed
with the initial frame and, accordingly, the average coordinates were
computed. Further alignment was performed over the average coordinates
based on the Gaussian RMSD algorithm.78 The coordinates of each atom were taken as a random variable to
form a covariance matrix, which was further diagonalized to obtain
eigenvectors generated with 90% of the variance. The first two eigenvectors
were selected based on the cumulative percent contribution for further
analysis as they covered a minimum of 40% variance (Figure S5). The porcupine plots representing the essential
dynamics were built in PyMOL.60 Lindemann’s
coefficient was calculated for each base and averaged over 5 sets,
the calculation was based on the formula72,79  where N is the number of
atoms, a′ is the empirical constant most probable
nonbonded near-neighbor distance and ΔRi2 is the fluctuation of the atom, i.

In unbound-Pu27 (Figure S6), the capping
arrangement of the 5′ overhanging stretch is assisted by guanines
of Loop-2; however, the dynamicity of the respective bases is in a
higher range in the whole simulation period. As found in a previous
study,43 the stacking arrangement within
T1, G13, and G14 is essential for stabilization of the cap, and this
is absent in the current trajectory, which leads to the dynamic behavior
of the 5′ overhanging stretch. In the Pu27–TPP complex (Figure S7), the overall dynamicity
of the quadruplex and ligand molecule is reduced with simulation time.
TPP strengthens the capping of the 5′ overhanging stretch;
polar interactions among G2–G3, G2–G4, G4–TPP, and TPP–A15, and H–π stacking
interactions in G2/TPP/G14 are found in cap formation. In the RJC
and AWO complexes (Figures S8 and S9),
the structure is highly dynamic, especially in the loop regions and
at the 5′ end. Ligand molecules (RJC and AWO) also show high
flexibility.

Zhou et al. and Jamroz et al. applied the Lindemann’s
coefficient
as a measure of the solid and liquid behavior of protein molecules.72,79 Small values of ΔL (<0.15) indicate a solid
nature and higher values (>0.15) indicate a liquid nature of respective
bases. In previous studies, we utilized the same concept to determine
the dynamic properties of G-quadruplex.43 Here, we compared all of the states of Pu27 and
ΔL of the backbone atoms (Figure S10B) suggest that the secondary structure is rigid in all
of the systems; however, the 5′ overhanging stretch is highly
flexible and stabilized to some extent in the presence of TPP. Here,
the backbone atoms are exposed to solvent molecules and thus posses
ΔL higher than 0.15; however, the side chain atoms
that are buried in the core region have lower ΔL values.79 Side chain atoms of the loop regions and 5′
overhanging stretch are most flexible (Figure S10A). In the presence of TPP, the flexibility of the 5′
overhanging bases is reduced as they are arrested in capped conformation.

Binding Free Energy Estimation
As can be seen in Table 2, the binding of all
three ligands is energetically favored as the binding free energy
estimated using the MMPBSA and MMGBSA methods is in the negative range.
Both electrostatic energies (Eele) and
van der Waal’s energies (EvdW)
are contributing favorably in the binding of all three ligands; the
same was found to be evident in the docked conformations as well as
in the simulated conformations. However, the electrostatic energy
components (Eele) are counterbalanced
by the polar solvation energy components (EPB), and the overall electrostatic interactions impart repulsive forces.
Thus, van der Waal’s energies EvdW are found to be deterministic in the binding free energies of the
respective ligands. Comparative analysis suggests that TPP and RJC
bindings are more favored compared to that of AWO. The energy components
leading to binding of TPP are in close correlation with those of chelerythrine
(naturally occurring plant alkaloid with anticancer activity) and
12-methoxy chelerythrine, which are reported in a previous study.43 Thus, we can state that, like chelerythrine,
TPP can also arrest the G-quadruplex structure formed in Pu27 and it can inhibit the expression of c-MYC oncogene.

In summary, analysis of the simulated systems suggests
that binding
of TPP with Pu27 is energetically favorable and well
supported by hydrogen bond interactions as well as polar interactions,
which impart stabilization over the secondary structure of quadruplex.
TPP shows druglike properties, and further, it possesses pharmacophoric
features such as a central positive charge (piperidinium motif), moderately
flexible skeleton, aromatic ring to form π–π interactions, and polarity imparted by the thiadiazole motif,
which assist in the binding of TPP with Pu27. TPP
was explored further using an experimental approach to evaluate the
proposition that TPP can interact with Pu27 and that
it may lead to downregulation of c-MYC expression.

CD
CD spectroscopy provides significant information
regarding various topologies, the effect of metal ions, and the thermal
stability of G-quadruplex structures. Parallel G-quadruplex structures
display a positive peak near 260 nm and a negative peak around 240
nm. CD spectra with a positive peak around 290 nm and a negative minima
near 265 nm represent antiparallel topology. A hybrid G-quadruplex
structure exhibits a positive peak near 290 nm and a positive shoulder
around 270 nm.80,81 The CD spectra of Pu27 exhibits a positive peak at 261 nm with a negative minima at 240
nm, which is indicative of a parallel G-quadruplex structure (Figure 4A). There occurs
a slight decrease in elipticity in the CD spectra of Pu27 when titrated with increasing concentrations of TPP. However, the
overall topology of Pu27 remains the same after addition
of TPP (Figure 4A).
This slight alteration in elipticity may arise due to changes in the
local environment upon complex formation, such as the development
of new interactions between the receptor (Pu27) and
ligand (TPP) molecules, and/or changes in the dynamicity of the loop
bases. To explore whether TPP imparts any structural stabilization
upon binding with Pu27, we carried out thermal melting
experiments. The thermal melting profiles of Pu27 and the Pu27–TPP complex reveal that TPP,
upon interacting with Pu27, imparts moderate stabilization
(ΔTm = ∼3 °C) (Figure S11A,B). Pu27 itself
forms a very stable G-quadruplex in the presence of K+ ions
(Tm = 77.8 °C), which might be the
reason behind the minute increase in Tm upon addition of TPP. To avoid the influence of ions and to establish
the major stabilizing effect by TPP on Pu27, melting
of the complex was carried out in water (K+ < 1.5 mM).
We found a rise in Tm of ∼5 °C
in the Pu27–TPP complex compared to that of
the unbound-Pu27 in water (Figure S11C).
Thus, TPP, when added in a 1:3 ratio (Pu27/TPP),
stabilizes the secondary structure of Pu27.

ITC
The ITC experiment
was conducted to determine the
thermodynamic parameters behind the complexation of TPP with Pu27. It delivers information concerning the molecular forces,
energetics of binding, and most importantly the number of binding
sites of the macromolecule (here Pu27) engaged in
complex formation with the ligand (here TPP). The thermodynamic parameters
for the association of Pu27 with TPP obtained through
ITC are listed in Table 3. The thermogram for the interaction is shown in (Figure 4B), portraying a one-site binding
event. The Gibbs free energy change is negative (ΔG = −7.5 kcal mol–1) inferring the binding
interaction of TPP with Pu27 is energetically favorable.
The negative free energy change is attributed to a negative enthalpy
change and a positive change in entropy. Stacking interactions of
the planar molecule onto the bases of G-quadruplex and electrostatic
interactions are majorly responsible for the negative enthalpy. The
positive change in entropy of the Pu27–TPP
complex may arise from two factors: (i) the entropy of the system
may increase if binding of TPP results in release of the solvent molecules
or (ii) due to conformational changes in Pu27 upon
TPP binding. The negative enthalpy factor and positive entropy factor
correlate well with those of the molecular simulation data. The presence
of electrostatic interactions and H–π
interactions, as obtained from hydrogen bond analysis, may contribute
favorably toward the negative enthalpy change of the Pu27–TPP complex. B-factor analysis reveals that the flexibility of Loop-2
and Loop-3 of Pu27 increases upon binding of TPP,
thus increasing the conformational entropy of the system (Figure 3E,F). The second
factor behind the entropy term may be attributed to the perturbation
of the water structure upon binding of TPP with Pu27, as observed in the hydrogen bond analysis (Figure S2B) and water shell analysis (Figure S2F). The binding affinity (Ka) for the Pu27–TPP complex is 3.25
× 105 M–1. The binding affinity
obtained is comparable to previously reported literature.14 Small molecules like sanguinarine,82 chelerythrine,26 diarylethynyl
amides,83 arene ruthenium(II) complexes,84 aryl indenopyrimidine derivatives,85 and so forth, have similar binding affinity
toward c-MYC G-quadruplex structures. The molecule
TPP possesses a low Kd (high Ka) value but causes a modest increase in ΔTm upon binding with Pu27. This
implies that although the ligand has a moderate effect over the stabilization
of the secondary structure, it has significant binding affinity. Such
ligands can interfere with the expression of c-MYC, as previously reported by Kang et al.23 Waller et al. suggested that such ligands may be better suited for
interfering with protein–quadruplex recognition
thus disrupting the assembly of the respective transcription factors.86 The 1:1 binding stoichiometry of TPP with Pu27 found here is in accordance with the earlier reported
interaction patterns of small molecules with G-quadruplex DNA. Recently,
Bončina et al. studied the thermodynamics of various 1:1 complexes
of small molecules interacting with human telomeric G-quadruplexes.87 The Ru(II) complex acts as a groove binder to
the c-myc G4 DNA forming 1:1 complex.84 The thermodynamic feasibility (negative value of ΔG) of Pu27–TPP complex formation
is also reflected in the negative MMPBSA and MMGBSA values depicted
in Table 2.

NMR Titrations
NMR titrations were performed to explicate
the interactions of TPP with Pu24 at the atomic level.
As Pu27 forms multiple conformations in K+ solution, a truncated 24 mer sequence was used as it gives well-resolved
spectra between 10 and 12 ppm.25 The numbering
of the Pu24 sequence was done according to the previously
reported NMR spectra; to maintain the unambiguity in NMR assigned
residue numbers and residue numbers used in simulation, we put the
respective numbering of nucleotide bases corresponding to Pu27 in parenthesis. Although the first three bases from
the 5′-terminal are absent in the truncated version of Pu27, the bases involved in ligand binding are intact. With
increasing concentration of TPP (0.6:1.0, TPP/Pu24), an upfield chemical shift is observed for most of the imino protons
but substantial line broadening of most of the imino protons is absent
(Figure S12). G17 (G20-Pu27) displays a strong downfield chemical shift (−12.75 Hz) (Figure 4C). The chemical
shift perturbation of G4 (G7-Pu27) imino proton is
strong (13.47 Hz) but the peak is not broadened upon addition of TPP
(Figures 4C and S12). Imino protons of G17 (G20-Pu27) and G9 (G12-Pu27) show a strong chemical shift
perturbation along with broadening of the respective peaks (Figures 4C and S12). Moderate perturbations in chemical shift
are observed for G13 (G16-Pu27), G18 (G21-Pu27), and G14 (G17-Pu27) without any line
broadening (Figures 4C and S12). The maximum perturbations
in chemical shift are observed for the 5′ end guanine tetrad
(Pu24-G4-G8-G13-G17, Pu27-G7-G11-G16-G20),
followed by the middle tetrad (Pu24-G5-G9-G14-G18, Pu27-G8-G12-G17-G21) (Figure 4C). The 3′ end guanine tetrad (Pu24-G6-G15-G19-G24, Pu27-G9-G18-G22-G27) is least perturbed
compared to the 5′ end guanine tetrad (Figure 4C). This pattern of perturbation implies
that TPP is interacting with Pu24 without forming
multiple conformations and the 5′ end guanine tetrad is probably
offering a binding site. This is also depicted in the molecular dynamics
simulations. B-factor analysis reveals that G4 (G7-Pu27), G13 (G16-Pu27), and G17 (G20-Pu27) of Pu24 are highly stabilized upon association
with TPP (Figure 3B).
The high chemical shift perturbation of G9 (G12-Pu27) may arise due to flexibility of the Loop-2 and π–π interactions between its two consecutive adjacent bases,
G10 (G13-Pu27) and G11 (G14-Pu27), refer to video (tpp-pu27.avi). Interestingly, G20 (G23-Pu27) of the GAG triad, which remains intact over the entire
simulation run, shows high chemical shift perturbation of its imino
proton in NMR titrations. In visual observations of the simulated
trajectory, we found that A24 (A21-Pu24) forms steady
π–π stacking interactions with
G23 (G20-Pu24) in the Pu27–TPP complex, whereas in unbound-Pu27 A24 (A21-Pu24) is flexible. This enforced structural rigidity over
the GAG triad in the presence of TPP might be the reason behind the
observed high chemical shift perturbation of G20 (G23-Pu27). An array of one-dimensional 31P titrations of Pu24 with TPP was performed to verify the association of
TPP with the phosphate backbone of Pu24 (Figure S13); a similar approach was followed
in previous reports.88 Substantial line
broadening with a drop in intensity in one-dimensional 31P spectra of Pu24 was observed upon addition of
TPP in the molar ratio 0.6:1 (TPP/Pu24), suggesting
interaction of TPP with the phosphate backbone of Pu24. These results are in correlation with the interactions observed
in simulations where TPP is forming polar interactions with the phosphate
backbone of A15 (A12-Pu24) of Pu27 (Figure S2).

Rate of Hydrogen Exchange
(Kex)
To understand the base
pair stability, as per previous applications,68,89 we calculated the rate of hydrogen exchange of the imino protons
(Kex) of the unbound-Pu24 and Pu24–TPP complex. Figure 4D depicts the Kex value of the unbound-Pu24 and Pu24–TPP complex; the rate of exchange of most of the imino protons decreases
when TPP is added to Pu24. The calculated fold change
(Figure 4E) reveals
that the imino proton of G4 (G7-Pu27) is mostly affected,
followed by G24 (G27-Pu27), G14 (G17-Pu27), and G20 (G23-Pu27). The G13 (G16-Pu27), G9 (G12-Pu27), and G17 (G20-Pu27) guanine protons show a moderate exchange rate, whereas the rest
of the imino protons are least affected upon addition of TPP. The
decrease in Kex value of the Pu24–TPP complex compared to that of the unbound-Pu24 shows that the dynamicity of Pu24 is decreasing
after complex formation with TPP. Comparative analysis of the Kex value for the individual G-quartet reveals
that the 5′ end is mostly affected, followed by the second
quartet (Figure 4D,E)
and the 3′ end quartet is least affected (Figure 4D,E). It has been previously
reported by Lee et al. that regions that are protected from solvent
display the slowest exchange rate compared to those of solvent exposed
sites.90 Both the rate of exchange and
one-dimensional 1H titration correlate well with the molecular
dynamics simulations, where the 5′ end tetrad guanines are
stabilized when bound with TPP and the 5′ end tetrad guanines
are buried by the 5′ end overhanging bases thus reducing solvent
exposure to a certain extent. ITC data also reveal that the entropy
of the system increases after association of TPP with Pu24; as an increase in entropy may also be attributed to perturbation
of solvent molecules associated with Pu24, thus the
perturbed solvent structure might be the factor behind the decrease
in rate of hydrogen exchange in the Pu24–TPP
complex.

The increased compactness of Pu27 after
its association with TPP, the 1:1 binding stoichiometry, and the 5′-end
of Pu27 being the preferred region of binding are
in good agreement with molecular simulation data. Thus, the biophysical
techniques implemented in this study support the observations as obtained
from molecular dynamics simulations. After analyzing the interaction
profile of TPP with Pu27 through simulated conditions
and various biophysical experiments, the molecule was proposed for
ex vivo study to investigate its potential in arresting intracellular c-MYC expression.

MTT Assay
The T47D cell line was
taken as an in cellulo
model to investigate the effect of TPP on the expression of c-MYC, as earlier studies reported that the T47D cell line
displays elevated levels of endogenous c-MYC.91 An MTT assay was carried out in T47D (human
breast ductal carcinoma cell line) and NKE (normal kidney epithelial
cell line) cells to examine the cytotoxic effect and anticancer property
of the molecule TPP. The results depict that TPP significantly and
selectively reduces cell viability in T47D cells (19.45% live cells
at 50 μM), whereas the NKE cells remain mostly unaffected (74.36%
live cells at 50 μM) (Figure S14).
This observation underlies the selective anticancer activity of TPP.

Flow Cytometry
In the MTT assay, the depletion of cell
viability does not dictate if the cancer cells undergo apoptosis or
necrosis. Therefore, we performed flow cytometry-based Annexin V-FITC
and propidium iodide (PI) staining experiments for the evaluation
of apoptosis and cell viability in T47D and NKE cells treated with
TPP at increasing concentrations for 24 h.

The percentages of
live, early and late apoptotic, and necrotic or dead populations were
quantitatively determined. Annexin V-FITC tags those cells that are
en route to early apoptotic events exposing the phosphatidylserine
residues to the outer leaflet of the lipid bilayer. PI binds to the
nucleic acid and stains the cells that have lost their membrane integrity. In brief, the cells tagged with
Annexin V-FITC/PI are classified as follows: dead or necrotic cells
(the upper left quadrant; Annexin–/PI+ and the upper right quadrant; Annexin+/PI+), early apoptotic cells (the lower right quadrant; Annexin+/PI–), and live cells (the lower left quadrant;
Annexin–/PI–).92,93

The results demonstrate that TPP selectively induces apoptosis
in cancer cells, whereas the normal NKE cells were appreciably unaffected
(Figures 5A and S17). An escalation in the concentration above
20 μM culminates in a sharp decline in the cell viability with
a concomitant increase in the apoptotic population (early apoptosis
+ late apoptosis) in the T47D cell line. A gradual hike in the early
apoptotic and necrotic population is pronounced in the range of 20–50
μM TPP (early apoptotic population ∼10, ∼31, ∼18,
∼16%, necrotic population ∼4, ∼8, ∼38,
∼48% at 20, 30, 40, and 50 μM, respectively) (Figure 5B). The IC50 value (concentration at which 50% of cells are alive) was calculated
to be around 35 μM in cancer cells whilst in normal cells around
99% of cells remain alive in the concentration range of 25–85
μM (Figure 5C).
However, 50% cell death is not achieved at 150 μM concentration
of TPP in NKE cells even unattained at 150 μM concentration
of TPP in normal cells. Above 100 μM, a gradual increase in
the necrotic population is evident in the case of normal cells (∼6,
∼10, ∼6, ∼16, and ∼28% at 100, 120, 130,
140, and 150 μM, respectively), which suggests that TPP selectively
promotes apoptosis in T47D cancer cells (higher c-MYC levels) over normal cells. Therefore, TPP could be a promising lead
to show a safe therapeutic index and exert anticancer activity.

Figure 5 TPP exhibits
anticancer properties and abrogates c-MYC transcription
in T47D cancer cells. (A) TPP selectively induces
apoptosis in cancer cells: FACS dot plots showing apoptosis induction

In the RT-PCR analysis, the target genes are normalized to the average
of internal control gene GAPDH and represented in arbitrary units.

RT-PCR Study
After examining its
anticancer property,
we proceeded to study the effect of TPP in c-MYC transcription
in T47D cells. We reasoned that if the molecule binds to the G-quadruplex
structure developed in the upstream promoter region of the human c-MYC gene, the endogenous expression of c-MYC mRNA will be negatively regulated.94 In
this study, T47D cells were treated with TPP in a concentration-dependent
manner and the total RNA, extracted from the treated cells, was processed
to poly-(A) specific reverse Transcription (RT) to produce cDNA. This
cDNA served as the template for specific PCR amplification of the c-MYC gene and the expression level of GAPDH gene was used
to normalize the data obtained from different samples. The semiquantitative
densitometric analyses demonstrate a notable downregulation in c-MYC expression profiles at the mRNA level with increasing
concentrations of TPP. 30 μM TPP treatment renders significant
repression (58.28% relative to the control) in c-MYC mRNA expression. An increase in TPP concentration up to 35 μM
results in almost a 3-fold repression (66.36% relative to the control)
of the intracellular abundance of c-MYC mRNA (Figure 5E). However, further
increments in the dose up to 40 μM do not alter the mRNA expression
(65.58% relative to the control) compared to that of the 35 μM
TPP treated set, which indicates that 35 μM exerts a saturating
impact for the abrogation of c-MYC transcription.

Reporter Luciferase Assay
As c-MYC lies
at the nexus of innumerable crosstalks and its expression is
highly orchestrated by a number of signaling cues, we could not comment
from the RT-PCR experiment on whether TPP interferes with the quadruplex
in NHE III1 element to repress c-MYC transcription.
Therefore, to shed light on TPP’s underlying mechanism of transcription
abrogation, we attempted the reporter luciferase assay to verify the
potential of TPP in targeting the quadruplex forming motif in the
NHE III1 element.24 We transfected
the T47D cells with two luciferase vectors: (a) one having the major
promoters (P1–P2) only and devoid of the quadruplex forming
motif in the NHE III1 (Pu27) and (b) the
other comprising of both NHE III1 (Pu27) and P1–P2 promoters. Then, the promoter activities, in the
presence of both the vectors, were monitored under different concentrations
of TPP. We found that the promoter activity is akin to the control
set in the absence of the Pu27 region in the upstream
promoter (P1–P2) of c-MYC. This suggests that
TPP does not promote any significant alteration in the promoter activity
in the absence of the quadruplex forming motif. But, transfection
of NHE III1 (+) P1–P2 luciferase vector translates
into significant depletion of c-MYC promoter activity
with increasing concentrations of TPP. At 40 μM TPP, almost
60% repression in promoter activity is accomplished compared to that
of the untreated one (Figure 5F). Therefore, the integration of RT-PCR and reporter assays
gives an insight that TPP has no function in c-MYC transcription regulation in the absence of NHE III1,
but in the presence of the quadruplex forming motifs it interacts
with the quadruplex structure, which in turn probably inhibits the
recruitment of RNA polymerase or other transcription factors in the
proximal promoter region, rendering transcription repression.

Conclusions
Overexpression of c-MYC is observed in different
cancerous conditions; the quadruplex forming motif in NHE III1 found in the vicinity of P1 promoter of c-MYC oncogene significantly represses its transcription and therefore
provides a promising therapeutic target in anticancer treatment. Here,
we have implemented small molecule induced stabilization of G-quadruplex
to interfere with the expression of c-MYC.

A pool of small molecules was screened based on their druglike
properties using a virtual screening method and further target specific
molecules were mined out using molecular docking. Atomistic binding
characterization was investigated theoretically through all atom molecular
dynamics simulations with the top three molecules, named “TPP,
RJC, and AWO”. Structural analysis of the simulated trajectories
inferred the superiority of a small molecule “TPP” over
the other two ligands studied (AWO and RJC). The biophysical observations
correlate well with the simulation results inferring 1:1 binding stoichiometry
with a Kd value in the sub-micro-molar
range and ΔG in the negative range. High-resolution
NMR spectroscopy confirmed the atomistic details found in simulation
inferring the 5′ end guanine stack as a binding site and stabilization
of the overall secondary structure with a rigid conformation of TPP.
MTT assay and flow cytometry analysis signify the selective cytotoxicity
and anti-proliferative effect of TPP on the T47D cancer cells over
that of the normal NKE cells. RT-PCR confirms the downregulation c-MYC expression in T47D cancer cells upon treatment with
TPP at micromolar concentration. The reporter luciferase assay further
validates the proposed mechanism of action of TPP, that is, TPP is
arresting the quadruplex forming motif Pu27 and further
interfering with the transcription process.

The combined effort
of rational drug design with in silico, biophysical,
and biological approaches has offered a promising lead molecule “TPP”,
which can be explored further as a new generation anticancer agent.
