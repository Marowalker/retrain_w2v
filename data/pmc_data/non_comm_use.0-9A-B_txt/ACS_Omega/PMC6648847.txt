A promiscuous Bacillus glycosyltransferase (YjiC)
was explored for the enzymatic synthesis of monoterpene O-glycosides in vitro and in vivo. YjiC converted seven monoterpenes
into 41 different sugar-conjugated novel glycoside derivatives. The
whole-cell biotransformation of the same set of monoterpenes exhibited
robust enzyme activity to synthesize O-glucosyl derivatives
from Escherichia coli. These newly
synthesized selected monoterpene-O-glucosyl derivatives
exhibited enhanced antibacterial activities against human pathogenic
bacteria and antinematodal activities against pine wood nematode Bursaphelenchus xylophilus.

Introduction
Approximately 55,000
terpenoids have been identified from diverse
sources. They are well known to exhibit anticancer, antimicrobial,
antifungal, antiviral, antiparasitic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidative,
antihyperglycemic, and skin permeation enhancing activities.1 Monoterpenes that contain 10 carbon atoms in
various branched and often cyclic structures sharing p-methane are increasingly getting popular as flavoring agents and
perfumery products, spices and seasoning of foods, and additives in
bath, oil lamps, massages, and aromatherapy.2 They are major constituents of essential oils and are nontoxic and
nonmutagenic to human. Thus, they are generally recognized as safe
(GRAS) for use as drug permeation enhancers.3 Using formulations containing menthol, thymol, carvacrol, linalool,
anethole, and limonene in humans does not lead to skin irritation
or sensitization.4 However, these compounds
have extremely low water solubility that their use in the industry
is limited.5 The major hurdle in modifying
these molecules to other derivatives is associated with loss of inherent
flavor and certain pharmacological properties. However, glycosides
of monoterpenes have high water solubility. Sugar-conjugated terpenes
can retain their inherent flavor after hydrolysis of the compound,
which releases terpene and sugar. Moreover, sugar-conjugated natural
products are known to exhibit different biological activities.6 Although a small number of monoterpene glycosides
have been isolated from natural sources, few glycosides have been
produced using the whole-cell biotransformation of microbial and plant
cells.7 Selected monoterpene glycosides
chemically synthesized by Higashiyama and Sakata have several limitations
associated with their regio- and stereoselectivities, final yields,
purification steps, and protection/deprotection of functional groups.8

In recent years, we have explored the catalytic
promiscuity of
glycosyltransferases (GTs; EC 2.4) for the synthesis of diverse sugar-conjugated
natural products. YjiC, one of the Bacillus licheniformis DSM 13 glycosyltransferases belonging to GT1 family proteins in
CAZy classification (www.cazy.org), has been discovered to possess highly flexible activity toward
a wide range of plant and microbial polyketides.9 To investigate the potential of using this recombinant
enzyme to synthesize glycodiverisified monoterpenes, we examined its
activity with selected commercially available medicinally important
monoterpene alcohols and different nucleotide diphosphate sugars (NDP-sugars).

Results
and Discussion
To study the promiscuity of YjiC toward monoterpenes,
eugenol (1) was initially used as an acceptor substrate,
while UDP-α-d-glucose (UDP-Glc) was used as a glucose
donor. Then, Ni-affinity
purified His6-tagged fusion protein produced in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) was allowed to react
with 2 mM 1 in 200 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing
20 μg/mL YjiC and 2 mM UDP-Glc at 37 °C for 3 h (Scheme 1). After adding methanol as
a quenching reagent, the reaction was analyzed by high-performance
liquid chromatography–photodiode array (HPLC-PDA) and high-resolution
quadruple time-of-flight electrospray ionization mass spectrometry
(HRqTOF-ESI/MS) in positive mode. The reaction lacking eugenol served
as a control reaction. MS analysis of 1a showed a spectrum
of an ion peak at m/z [M + Na]+ 349.1270,
which resembled glucose (162 amu greater)-conjugated 1 for which the calculated exact mass was 349.1263 Da. The sister
fragment of 1 with an ion peak at m/z [M + H]+ 165.0914 confirmed 1 (Figure S1). Under identical conditions, six other
monoterpene alcohols thymol (2), isoeugenol (3), carvacrol (4), α-terpineol (5),
(+)-menthol (6), and (−)-borneol (7) were assessed as acceptor substrates. HPLC-PDA and HRqTOF-ESI/MS
analyses confirmed the glucose-conjugated monoterpene alcohols (Figures S2–S7 and Table S1). Conversion
rates for most of these compounds were more than 40% except for 5 and 7, which had a conversion rate of only
30 and 16%, respectively. The maximum conversion rate was achieved
for 3 (∼78%), followed by that for 1 (65%) and 4 (51%).

Scheme 1 YjiC Mediated In Vitro Glycodiversification
of Monoterpene Alcohols
Among the seven monoterpenes (1–7) used as acceptor substrates, four molecules (1–4) contain a benzene ring in their structure
(Figure 1A). The conversion
percentage
of these molecules to glucosides (1a–4a) is fairly high when UDP-Glc was used as the glucose donor substrate
(Figure 1B). This results
provide the evidence to support that YjiC has more substrate specificity
toward a phenolic ring containing the acceptor substrates. A previous
report has shown that YjiC converted phenolic compounds such as flavonoids,
stilbenes, and chalcones to multiple glucosides by conjugating glucose
moieties to multiple available phenolic hydroxyl groups.9 Similarly, the conversion of 7 to 7a was the least among all. Structurally, compound 7 is a bicyclic monoterpene, while the remaining compounds are monocyclic.
This structural difference could be a possible reason for less preference
by YjiC over other acceptor substrates for glycosylation.

Asterisk (*) represents the glucosylated products that are identified
by 1H and 13C NMR analyses. ND indicates no
detection of the product.

All products (1a–7a) were
prepared
in large scale under identical reaction conditions and purified by
prep-HPLC (Figure S8) for structural characterization. 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic analyses of 1a–7a were in good agreement with glucose-conjugated 1–7 (Figures S9–S15). The appearance of a distinct doublet spectrum between δ
4.1 and 5.0 ppm with a coupling constant of ∼J = 7.5 Hz (Table S2) represented the anomeric
proton (1′) of the glucose moiety in β configuration.
Other spectra for glucose were in the range of 3 to 5 ppm. In 13C NMR, anomeric carbon was distinctly observed at around
100 ppm, while other spectra of glucose were present between 60 and
80 ppm (Figures S9–S15).

To
further expand the chemical diversity of monoterpene alcohol
glycosides, in addition to UDP-Glc, six other nucleotide diphosphate
(NDP)-sugars [UDP-galactose (UDP-Gal), UDP-glucuronic acid (UDP-GlcA),
UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine (UDP-GalNAc), UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GluNAc), TDP-rhamnose (TDP-Rhm),
and GDP-fucose (GDP-Fuc)] were reacted with all 1–7 acceptor substrates. HPLC-PDA and HRqTOF-ESI/MS analyses
(Figures S17–S22) of all these reaction
mixtures showed the capacity of YjiC to tolerate a wide range of NDP-sugars
to transfer most of these sugars to acceptor molecules, generating
a total of 41 glycoside derivatives (1b–g to 7b–g) (Figure 1). However, the enzyme had
a relatively small catalytic activity for other sugars. With most
of these sugar donors, the conversion rate was limited (below 5–10%).
One of the sugars used in the reaction, GalNAc, was conjugated with
only 1 and 6 with detectable conversion
percentage. Thus, we did not scale up these reactions to preparative
scale for structural elucidation or biological activities.

The
conversion of 1–7 to 1a–7a was higher when UDP-Glc was used
as a sugar donor. However, the conversion of the same set of molecules
with other NDP-sugars (b–g) to glycosides
(1b–g to 7b–g) was comparatively very low (Figure 1). This result demonstrated that UDP-Glc
is one of the preferred substrates among seven different NDP-sugars.
In nature, UDP-Glc is abundantly present in all living cells, and
many GTs accept UDP-Glc to transfer to a range of acceptor substrates
within the cell.10 YjiC, though found as
a promiscuous enzyme to accept wide ranges of substrates and NDP-sugars,9 preferred UDP-Glc over other NDP-sugars. However,
this statement warrants further studies such as the crystal structure
of YjiC and molecular docking of different acceptors and donor NDP-sugars
to provide a clear understanding of substrates preferences.

Experiments were also carried out to check the possible synthesis
of diverse sugar-conjugated monoterpenes using YjiC and cheap synthetic
sugar donors such as p-nitrophenyl-β-d-xyloside (8) and p-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside (9) in one-pot transglycosylation
reactions. Most GTs are capable of reversing the glycosylation reaction
in the presence of NDPs.11 This property
of GT helps to use alternative cheap sugar donors instead of relatively
expensive NDP-sugars for the cost-effective production of natural
product glycosides.12 Purified YjiC was
used along with other reaction ingredients under aforementioned reaction
conditions, and 1 was used as the sugar acceptor in Tris-HCl
buffer at 37 °C. The reaction was carried out for 13 h. As shown
in Figure 2, various
NDPs such as ADP, TDP, CDP, GDP, and UDP were used at a concentration
of 4 mM to transfer sugar moieties xylose (Xyl) and galactose (Gal)
from 8 and 9, respectively. In the presence
of high concentrations of NDPs, YjiC drove the reaction in the opposite
direction to produce NDP-Xyl and NDP-Gal eventually utilized by the
same enzyme to conjugate Xyl and Gal moieties to 1 in
the coupled one-pot reaction. Byproduct 10 was released
in the reaction medium, which developed a yellow color representing
the progress of the reaction. Samples were taken at different time
points to check the production of 1e and 1h. HPLC-PDA analysis showed that all five NDPs could be equally used
to carry out transglycosylation with a conversion rate of ∼60%
from 1 to 1e using 9 as the
Gal donor. The conversion reached almost the maximum within 30 min.
It was increased slightly until 13 h. However, the synthesis of 1h was lower under identical conditions when 8 was used as the Xyl sugar donor. The conversion rate of 1 to 1h was below 5% in ADP, GDP, and CDP. However, it
reached ∼35% with UDP and 20% with TDP after 13 h of reaction
(Figure 2).

ADP, GDP, and CDP). (B) Conversion percentage of 1 to

Many organic compounds with limited water solubility precipitate
during in vitro enzymatic reaction. Thus, the use of organic co-solvents
is considered to be useful for the enhancement of enzymatic reactions.
We also studied the effect of co-solvent such as dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) for the conversion of monoterpenes to their glucosides. Compound 2 was randomly selected to check its conversion to 2a in the presence of DMSO, which is generally considered as a beneficial
co-solvent for the enzymatic reactions. However, the result showed
no increment in the conversion percentage of 2 to 2a in the presence of DMSO. The conversion percentage was
somehow similar when there was no DMSO in the reaction mixture and
in the presence of 5 and 10% DMSO. Instead, the conversion was decreased
when the DMSO concentration was increased from 15 to 25% to the final
concentration of the reaction mixture (Figure S23). DMSO is a good organic solvent that solubilizes organic
molecules and makes them available for enzymes to react in the mixture.
However, in the case of compound 2, the water solubility
is 0.98 g/L (∼6.6 mM). The reaction mixture contained only
2 mM 2, which is completely soluble in water or reaction
buffer condition. Thus, there was no additional catalytic enhancement
in the conversion of 2 to 2a while using
DMSO as a co-solvent in the reaction.

The stability of YjiC
under reaction conditions was also studied
using compound 2 as an acceptor substrate for glycosylation.
Four sets of glycosylation reactions were set up in triplet and placed
in a 37 °C water bath. These reaction mixtures contained all
reaction ingredients except the donor and acceptor substrates. Each
set of reaction was activated after 0, 2, 5, and 10 h of incubating
at a 37 °C water bath by adding UDP-Glc and compound 2. The relative conversion percentage of 2 to its glucoside 2a was determined using HPLC-PDA analysis at different time
intervals from 2 to 180 min. When the reaction was activated at 0
h, the enzyme reached the maximum conversion within 15 min and started
to reverse the reaction as the accumulation of compound 2 was seen. This decrease in product concentration is because of the
deglycosylation property of YjiC. YjiC drove the reaction in the opposite
direction in the presence of high concentrations of nucleotide diphosphates
such as UDP and glucosides. This behavior of YjiC was also observed
with other acceptor substrates in previous studies.9 In a similar manner, when the reaction was activated after
2 h, the enzyme achieved the maximum conversion considerably late
after 60 min and started to decrease in product concentration due
to deglycosylation by YjiC. However, when the reaction mixture was
activated after 5 and 10 h, the enzyme activity was dramatically decreased
and did not achieve the maximum conversion percentage (Figure S24). These results clearly showed that
the enzyme’s activity was decreased over time under the reaction
condition at 37 °C.

Since the enzymatic synthesis of natural
product glycosides requires
purified enzymes and large quantities of NDP-sugars are costly, the
process is difficult to scale up for practical quantity biosynthesis.
Thus, we shifted the biosynthesis of monoterpene glucosides into the
microbial system using recombinant E. coli BL21 (DE3) harboring YjiC plasmid (Figure 3A). The recombinant strain can utilize indigenous
cytosolic UDP-Glc as a glucose donor and biotransform exogenously
supplemented monoterpene alcohols to respective glucoside derivatives
in Luria–Bertani broth medium.13 These growing recombinant cells were induced by isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside at a final concentration of 0.5 mM
and incubated at 20 °C for 12 h for protein expression. These
induced cells were then supplemented with exogenous 0.5 mM monoterpene
alcohols (dissolved in DMSO) and further incubated at 20 °C for
biotransformation. Time-dependent HPLC-PDA and ELSD analysis of 1–7 revealed the conversion of all substrates
into respective O-glucosides and excreted out of
the cells into the growth medium (Figure S25). Interestingly, the conversion reached the maximum within 4 h and
remained almost constant or slightly increased until 68 h. The in
vitro conversion profile was different from in vivo conversion. The
conversion of 5 was elevated to 80% in the in vivo reaction.
However, it was limited to 30% in the in vitro reaction system. Conversions
of 2 and 4 were decreased, while those of 1 and 3 remained almost the same as those in
the in vitro conversion system. Cell lysates were also subjected to
HPLC-PDA and ELSD analyses for the possible accumulation of glucosides
inside the cells. However, the concentrated cell lysate methanol extract
did not show any glucoside peak in considerable abundance (Figure S26). When the same strain was supplemented
with additional 5% sterile glucose in the culture medium at 0, 12,
and 24 h of substrate feeding, it showed elevated conversion for most
monoterpenes. Conversions of 3a and 6a reached
∼100%, while those of 1a and 5a reached
90% in 36 h. Those of 2a, 4a, and 7a reached 60% or more (Figure 3B). The in vivo conversion of 1–7 established the cost-effective biosynthesis of 1a–7a in a regiospecific manner through a sustainable
and green approach.

coli BL21 (DE3) harboring pET28-YjiC at different
time intervals. The conversion of all monoterpenes was checked at
a 0.5 mM final concentration. A 5% final concentration of sterile
glucose was also supplemented at 0, 12, and 24 h.

All these newly synthesized glucoside derivatives (1a–7a) were produced using the in vivo
system [isolated
yields: 1a (93.3%), 2a (47.6%), 3a (91.3%), 4a (51.5%), 5a (75.4%), 6a (68%), and 7a (43%)]. They were purified using
prep-HPLC and used for antibacterial and antinematodal assays. All
seven O-glucoside derivatives of monoterpene alcohols
were accessed for their antibacterial activities against 16 different
Gram-positive and Gram-negative human pathogens (Table S4). Most Staphylococcus aureus strains used in this study were methicillin-resistant or methicillin-susceptible
(MRSA/MSSA) superbugs. Since most of the glucosides tested showed
antibacterial activities in disc-diffusion assay (Table S5), we further determined the minimum inhibitory concentration
(MIC) values of these compounds (1–7 and 1a–7a) in liquid culture. Results
showed the loss of antibacterial activity of glucoside derivatives 1a, 2a, 3a, and 4a for
most pathogens tested, although they retained similar MIC values for
selected MRSA, Kocuria rhizophila,
and Proteus hauseri strains. However, 5a retained the antibacterial activity similar to its parent
molecule against most pathogens tested. Moreover, it showed 2-fold
lower MIC values against K. rhizophila and Klebsiella pneumonia. Interestingly, 6a and 7a not only retained the antibacterial
potential of their respective parent molecules but also gained antibacterial
properties (2- to 4-fold higher than their parent molecules against
MRSA and MSSA strains). 6a also exhibited a 4-fold lower
MIC value than 6 against P. hauseri. It had a 2-fold lower MIC value against several pathogens, including
MSSA, MRSA, Salmonella enterica, and K. rhizophila (Table 1).

The same set of molecules were
also used to study their potential
application for pinewood nematode control. In vitro antinematodal
activity was determined using Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, a pinewood nematode known to infect pine trees, resulting in pine
wilt and finally death of the plant.14 Pine
wilt epidemics widely occurs in eastern Asian countries such as Japan,
Korea, China, and Taiwan, and in North and South American countries.
This nematode is also threatening wild ecosystem worldwide.15 Nematode infection can be controlled by applying
organophosphorus compounds such as thiacloprid, acetamiprid, fenitrothion,
and malathion. However, concerns for the use of such toxic molecules
have increased due to their toxicity via food chain and environmental
contamination issues (www.fao.org).16 Alternative nematocides including
levamisole, thionazin, and avermectin analogs such as emamectin and
milbemactin are also used to prevent pine wilt disease including other
plant wilt diseases.17 In this context,
we assayed plant volatile metabolites with GRAS status having strong
odor such as monoterpenes (1–7) and
their glucoside derivatives synthesized in this study (1a–7a) against pinewood nematode B. xylophilus through in vitro experiment. Most of
these glucoside derivatives of monoterpenes (1, 1a, 3, 3a, 4, 4a, 6, 6a, 7, and 7a) lost their antinematodal properties. However, compounds 2a and 5a exhibited significantly higher antinematodal
activities, with lethal concentration 50% (LC50%) values
of 1.002 and 0.246 mM, respectively (Table 2). The LC50% concentration of 2a was approximately 2-fold lower than its parent aglycone,
whereas the value of 5a was 16-fold lower than compound 5. Previously, it has been reported that selected monoterpenes
possess antinematodal activities.18 This
preliminary evidence of superior antinematodal activities of 2a and 5a opens up opportunities to develop these
safe-to-human molecules as future lead compounds for the control of
pine wilt disease.

The mode of action of glycoconjugates synthesized
in this study
against nematode and bacteria is unknown. There are chances of deglycosylation
of these molecules prior to acting on the target. Nevertheless, we
also cannot rule out the fact that many natural product glycosides
such as doxorubicin, erythromycin, avermectins, and amphotericin B
are active only when sugars are conjugated on them. Thus, there are
equal chances of acting on target either in aglycon form after deglycosylation
or as it is in the glycoside form in in vivo systems. Thus, investigation
of the exact behavior of these compounds in in vivo systems could
be the subject of the next study.

Although YjiC is well known
as a promiscuous GT to glycosylate
different classes of natural products, biosynthesis of glycodiversified
monoterpenoids is the first report. In nature, a significant number
of terpenes exist as glycosides while conjugation of sugar unit is
crucial for their activity.19 Very few
reports are available on the biosynthesis of monoterpenoid glycosides.
Selected monoterpenes glycosides were reported to be produced by plant
whole-cell biotransformation.7 Many monoterpene
glycosides are chemically synthesized in industrial level. In this
context, the enzyme has shown broad applicability in the biotech industries
to synthesize human beneficial monoterpene glycosides either in a
cell-free system or using engineered microbial cells. Since both enzymatic
and microbial synthesis methods are eco-friendly, sustainable, cost-effective,
robust, and easy to scale up at the industrial level, this study provides
a broad path in the field of monoterpene glycosides synthesis using
green approach.

Experimental Part
General Experimental Procedures
A reversed-phase high-performance
liquid chromatography–photodiode array (HPLC-PDA) was performed
with a C18 column (YMC-Pack ODS-AQ; 4.6 mm internal diameter
(I.D.), 250 mm long, 5 μm particle size) connected to a PDA
detector (SPD-M20A) (Shimadzu, Japan) for the analysis of 1–5 and their derivatives using the binary condition
of H2O (0.01% trifluoroacetic acid buffer) and 100% acetonitrile
(ACN) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min for 30 min. The ACN concentrations
were 15% (0–12 min), 75% (12–18 min), and 15% (18–30
min) and stopped at 30 min. Compounds 6 and 7 and their derivatives are UV inactive. So, they were analyzed by
reversed-phase HPLC connected to a evaporative light scattering detector
(ELSD) (ELSD-LT II) (Shimadzu, Japan) under the same binary condition
of H2O (0.01% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) buffer) and acetonitrile
(ACN) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min for 30 min. The temperature of the
ELSD detector was set at 60 °C with a N2 gas flow
pressure with 350 psi. Since 6 and 7 were
highly volatile, we were unable to detect them; however, their glucosylated
derivatives were detected in ELSD. High-resolution quadruple time-of-flight
electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HRQTOF-ESIMS) was carried
out in positive ion mode on an Acquity mass spectrometer (with UPLC;
Waters, Milford, MA, USA) coupled with a Synapt G2-S system (Waters).

The compounds were extracted using a double volume of ethyl acetate
(2:1, v/v) using a Soxhlet extractor. The Soxhlet extractor was kept
still to separate the mixture for 4–6 h in room temperature
after shaking. The organic fraction of the extract was evaporated
using a rotary evaporator. The extract was subjected to preparative-HPLC
(prep-HPLC) for purification. Each glucosylated compounds were purified
using prep-HPLC (Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan) with a C18 column
(YMC–Pack ODS-AQ (250 × 20 mm I.D., 10 μm) connected
to a UV detector under the binary condition of H2O (0.05%
TFA buffer) and 100% ACN at a flow rate of 10 mL/min for 35 min. The
ACN concentrations were 20% (0–5 min), 50% (5–10 min),
70% (10–15% min), 90% (15–25 min), 50% (25–30
min), and 20% (30–35 min). To purify the glucosylated derivatives
of 6 and 7, the eluted solvent was collected
in a separate tube for every 1 min interval. Each fraction was analyzed
by HPLC-ELSD, and the pure fraction was concentrated for further use.

The pure fraction of glucosylated compounds was first dried using
a rotary evaporator and then lyophilized (HyperVAC-Max, HyperCOOL).
The dried sample was taken and dissolved in DMSO-d6 (Sigma-Aldrich) and further analyzed with a 300 MHz
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer. One-dimensional NMR
(1H NMR and 13C NMR) was performed to confirm
the structures of the glycosylated monoterpenes. All the raw data
were processed using TopSpin 3.1 software (Bruker) and further analyzed
by using MestReNova 8.0 software (Mestrelab Research S.L., Spain).

The standard curve of 6a and 7a was prepared
to determine the conversion percentage in in vitro and in vivo reactions.
A standard calibration curve was created using the integrated HPLC-ELSD
peak area of both compounds at different concentrations (312.5, 156.25,
78.125, 39.66, and 19.5 μg/mL).

In Vitro Glucosylation
Assay
The reaction was carried
out in a total volume of 450 μL by mixing the purified YjiC
enzyme (20 μg/mL) with 200 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 10
mM MgCl2, 2 mM monoterpenes (1–7), and 2 mM UDP-α-d-glucose as a sugar donor.
The reaction mixture was then incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. Three
parallel assays were routinely carried out. A double volume of chilled
methanol was used for quenching the reaction. Aliquots was removed
by centrifugation at 13,475g for 20 min and subjected
to HPLC-PDA or HPLC-ELSD.

Use of Co-Solvent in the Assay
To
study the effect
of co-solvent in product formation, the reaction was carried out using
DMSO as a co-solvent. The reaction was performed in a total volume
of 200 μL by mixing YjiC enzyme (20 μg/mL) with 200 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0),
10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM 2, and 2 mM UDP-Glc as a
sugar donor. Six sets of reactions were carried out using 0, 5, 10,
15, 20, and 25% of the final concentration of DMSO in the reaction
mixture. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. After 3 h,
reactions were quenched with a double volume of chilled methanol.
Aliquots were removed by centrifugation and analyzed by HPLC-PDA.

Stability of Glycosyltransferase under Reaction Conditions
To study the stability of glycosyltransferase under reaction conditions,
reactions were carried out in four different tubes under aforementioned
in vitro reaction conditions. All the reaction ingredients were added
in the microcentrifuge tubes except the donor and acceptor substrates.
All the tubes containing reaction ingredients were incubated at a
37 °C water bath. Substrates 2 and UDP-Glc were
added in the tubes and activated the reaction mixture at 0, 2, 5,
and 10 h. After activation of the reaction mixture, 50 μL of
the sample was taken from the reaction mixture at different time intervals
(2, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 min) and quenched by 450 μL
of chilled methanol. The aliquots were centrifuged, and each sample
was analyzed by using HPLC-PDA.

Biosynthesis of Diverse
Monoterpene Glycosides
To synthesize
diverse sugar-conjugated monoterpenes, reactions were carried out
with six different nucleotide diphosphate sugars including d and l sugars. For the NDP-d-sugars, four different
types of sugars were used. In correlation to glucose, C-2 position-modified
sugars (UDP-α-d-N-acetyl galactosamine
and UDP-α-d-N-acetyl glucosamine),
a C-4 position-modified (UDP-α-d-galactose), and a
C-6 position-modified sugar (UDP-α-d-glucuronic acid)
were used. Similarly, two NDP-l-sugars, TDP-l-rhamnose
and GDP-l-fucose, were also used for the in vitro reactions.
The reaction mixture contents were added in an identical concentration
to aforementioned methods. Each substrate (1 to 7) was reacted with all six different NDP-sugars. Altogether,
42 different reactions were carried out and incubated at 37 °C
for 3 h. Three parallel assays were routinely carried out. The reactions
were quenched with a double volume of chilled methanol. The aliquots
after centrifugation was analyzed by either HPLC-PDA or HPLC-ELSD.
All the in vitro reaction samples were further analyzed by HRQTOF-ESI-MS
analysis.

One-Pot Transglycosylation Reaction
The one-pot transglycosylation
reaction was carried out using various commercially available synthetic p-nitrophenyl glycosides such as p-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside, p-nitrophenyl-β-d-xyloside, and p-nitrophenyl-α-d-galactoside
in the presence of five different nucleotide diphosphates (NDPs) such
as UDP, ADP, CDP, GDP, and TDP. The reaction mixture containing 4
mM p-nitrophenyl glycosides, 4 mM NDP, 2 mM 1 (as an acceptor substrate), 10 mM MgCl2, 200
mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), and 20 μg/mL pure YjiC in a total
volume of 300 μL was incubated at 37 °C for 13 h. The sample
was collected at different time intervals (15, 30, 60, 180, and 780
min). Each sample was analyzed by HPLC-PDA. Three parallel assays
were routinely carried out.

Whole-Cell Bioconversion of Monoterpenes
E. coli BL21 (DE3) harboring pET28a-YjiC
was prepared
in a 5 mL culture volume in LB broth containing kanamycin antibiotic
for seed culture. The culture was incubated at 37 °C and kept
for overnight growth. The following day, 100 μL of pre-inoculum
was transferred to the 50 mL LB broth medium containing kanamycin
antibiotic. This was kept at 37 °C until the OD600nm reached 0.6. Then, the culture was induced by 0.5 mM isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG) and kept at 20 °C for 12 h. Standard
monoterpenes prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to a
final concentration of 0.5 mM. Additionally, 2% sterile glucose was
supplemented to each flask and again kept at 20 °C for 60 h.
The sample was taken every 12 h and analyzed by HPLC-PDA or HPLC-ELSD.
The same set of additional experiments were carried out in which,
instead of 2% glucose, 5% glucose was supplemented while feeding monoterpenes
and every 12 h. The conversion profile of each substrate was monitored
every 12 h interval. Three parallel assays were routinely carried
out. The conversion percentage of each substrate was calculated using
the integrated peak area of the substrate and product peak.
