Chitosan-based hydrogel has received
considerable interests because
of its appealing properties and applications in many areas. The primary
objective of this work was to produce novel cationic chitosan-based
hydrogels via polymerizing chitosan with two cationic monomers of
the same structure but with different counter ions [2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl]trimethylammonium
methyl sulfate (METMS) and [2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl]trimethylammonium
chloride (METAC). Polymerization of chitosan with the cationic monomers
performed under the conditions of 50 °C, 5 h, 7 pH, and 2/1 mol/mol
monomer/chitosan led to chitosan–METMS and −METAC with
the cationic charge densities of 3.22 and 2.88 mequiv/g, respectively.
Elemental analysis, gel permeation chromatography, Fourier transform
infrared, X-ray diffraction, and differential scanning calorimetry
analyses were used to confirm the impact of counter ions of cationic
monomers (i.e., polarizability of monomers) on their polymerization
performance and the characteristics of induced chitosan-based hydrogels.
Also, the results of this work postulated that the counter ions associated
with the monomers could dramatically impact the water uptake and swelling
properties of the generated chitosan-based hydrogels as well as their
performance in adsorbing an anionic dye from a simulated solution.

==== Body
Introduction
Hydrogels are defined as a class of macromolecular
and hydrophilic
networks that can contain a large fraction of liquid within their
structure. The hydrophilicity of hydrogels stems from the presence
of hydrophilic groups, such as amine (−NH2), carboxylic
acid (−COOH), and hydroxyl (−OH) groups in the hydrogel
networks.1,2 The main favorable properties of hydrogels
are their ability to imbibe large amount of liquid when they expose
to compatible solvents and their great adsorption performance.11−14 Hydrogels have received attentions for their wide range of applications,
such as heavy metal remediation,3−5 wastewater treatment,6 pharmaceutical industry,7 drug delivery systems,8,9 and wound dressing.10

There is a broad variety of hydrogels
produced from different natural
polymers (e.g., polysaccharides) and synthetic polymers [e.g., poly(ethylene
glycol)].15,16 Conventional synthetic polymer-based hydrogels
have limited uses because of the difficulties in their production
(e.g., side reactions and low coupling efficiency).17 Over past decades, hydrogels made from renewable and biodegradable
resources have been the focus of studies. Natural-based hydrogels,
especially polysaccharide-based ones, have obtained substantial interests
because of their nontoxicity, biocompatibility, low production price,
and structural versatility.18−20 Starch,21 cellulose,22 hemicellulose,23 lignin,24,25 alginic acid,26 hyaluronic acid,27 and chitosan-based hydrogels are the most studied polysaccharide-based
hydrogels. Chitosan is composed of randomly distributed β-(1–4)-linked d-glucosamine and N-acetyl-d-glucosamine
units that is accessible, renewable, biocompatible, bioactive, and
nontoxic.28,29 Despite the generation of chitosan-based
hydrogels, their water swelling and adsorption characteristics have
not been great, and the new generation of chitosan-based hydrogels
can be produced with superior properties.30

In recent studies, chitosan have been modified to produce
hydrogel
with improved properties in aqueous fluids.31−35 One possibility for inducing high-performance chitosan-based
hydrogel is to chemically crosslink it with other chemicals, such
as ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether,36 polyaniline,37 glutaraldehyde,38,39 and epichlorhydrine.40 The polymerization of chitosan with monomers,
such as 2-acrylamido-2-methyl propane sulfonic acid,41 is another modification method. Although these results
provide information on the influence of monomer’s structure
and type on producing hydrogel with different properties, they do
not discuss the impact of monomer’s counter ions on their reaction
performance with chitosan for hydrogel generation.

Charged monomers
are generally available in solutions along with
their oppositely charged counter ions, which are correlated together
by Coulombic attraction.42−44 Binding efficiency of counter
ions can be verified by considering the Hofmeister (lyotropic) series,
which are defined as the classification of iononic materials according
to their influence on these macroscopic properties.45,46 Different counter ions with altered polarizabilities affect their
polyions, which may severely impact the overall electron density of
monomers and thus their reaction tendency in polymerization. In aqueous
media, the penetration of water molecules in polyelectrolyte’s
interlayer space reduces the attractive forces between the polyions
and the counter ions;47,48 hence, polyions with different
binding efficiencies may polymerize differently. The first objective
of this work was to investigate the generation of chitosan-based hydrogel
via polymerizing it with two similar polyelectrolyte agents, whose
counter ions are different, [2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl]trimethylammonium
methyl sulfate (METMS) and [2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl]trimethylammonium
chloride (METAC).

Synthetic dyes are widely used in various
industries, such as pulp
and paper, textile, and food industries. The complex aromatic structure
of dyes causes their degradation and retardation challenging, which
has ecological and environmental footprints.49−51 Adsorption
has been known as an effective technique for the dye removal from
solutions because of its high efficiency, simplicity in operation,
and the reusability of the adsorbent.52 Hydrogels have also been reported as effective adsorbents for dye
segments.53,54 In one study, chitosan-based hydrogels were
applied for the removal of different anionic dyes (Acid Red 18, Acid
Orange 7, Methyl Orange and Basic Violet 14) from aqueous solutions.55 In another study, a surfactant-chitosan based
hydrogel was utilized for removing Congo red dyes.56 The second objective of this work was to evaluate the performance
of chitosan–METMS- and −METAC-based hydrogels in removing
reactive yellow 50 dye from solutions. The main novelty of present
work was the study on the impact of counter ions of cationic monomers
on their polymerization efficiency with chitosan for hydrogel production
and on the characteristics and performance of induced hydrogels.

Results
and Discussion
Reaction Mechanism
The reaction
scheme for the polymerization
of chitosan and METMS or METAC is depicted in Figure 1. Briefly, free radicals on the NH2 of deacetylated part of chitosan would be initiated with the help
of the initiator (H8N8CeO18). The
radicals would then attack the alkenyl group of cationic monomers,
METMS or METAC, generating chitosan–METMS or chitosan–METAC
polymers, respectively. In this case, the electron density of the
carbon double bond of the cationic monomers would likely be affected
by the binding affinity of the counter ions and the quaternary amine
group, which may affect the polymerization efficiency of chitosan
and the cationic monomer and properties of the induced hydrogels.
Coincidentally, as shown in Figure 1b, METMS or METAC could participate in a side reaction
generating the homopolymers of polyMETMS [P(METMS)] or polyMETAC [P(METAC)],
respectively.57

Figure 1 (a) Polymerization reaction
of chitosan with METMS/METAC in the
presence of initiator and (b) generation of METMS/METAC homopolymers.

The charge density of deacetylated chitosan was
reported to be
+0.88 mmol/g, which is mainly due to the existence of the NH3+ group on chitosan after dissolving in acidic solution.58 The polymerization of chitosan with METMS and
METAC was carried out according to the research performed on methacrylatoethyl
trimethyl ammonium chloride at temperature of 50 °C for 5 h at
natural pH.59 However, to understand the
polymerization performance of the cationic monomer and chitosan, the
impact of the monomer/chitosan ratio on the charge density of the
product was attested.

Effect of Monomer/Chitosan Molar Ratio
Figure 2 presents
the effect of METMS
and METAC dosage on the charge density of chitosan–METMS and
chitosan–METAC polymer. As depicted in Figure 2, increasing the molar ratio mimics chitosan–METMS
and chitosan–METAC polymer with a higher charge density, which
is basically due to the attachment of more METMS/METAC group to chitosan.
Chitosan–METMS and chitosan–METAC polymers exhibit the
maximum charge densities of +3.22 and +2.88 mmol/g at 1 mol/mol monomer/chitosan
ratio, respectively. The drop in the charge density at a higher reagent/chitosan
ratio could be due to the progress in the formation of homopolymers
of PMETMS and PMETAC (Figure 1b).60,61 A similar trend was reported
for the polymerization of xylan and METMS.62

of the monomer/chitosan molar ratio on the charge density
of chitosan–METMS and chitosan–METAC polymer.

Fourier Transform Infrared Analysis
Figure 3 displays
the Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectra for unmodified and modified chitosan. The
broad and strong peak ranging 3200–3600 cm–1 attributes to different vibrations, namely, O–H stretching
vibration at 3441 cm–1, NH2 asymmetric
stretching at 3360 cm–1, and NH stretching at 3293
cm–1.63,64 The bands indicated
at 2929 cm–1 contributed to sp3 C–H
stretching vibration of chitosan backbone and C–N stretching,
bands indicated at 2870 cm–1 belonged to the stretching
of (−C=O) of the amid group (CONHR) of chitosan, bands
indicated at 1605 cm–1 are attributed to −NH2 bending,65 and bands indicated
at 1647 cm–1 are associated with carbonyl (C=O)
stretching of secondary amid.64 The adsorption
bands at 1566 cm–1 are assigned to N–H bending
and N–H angular deformation in the CO NH plane.

Figure 3 FTIR spectra of chitosan,
chitosan–METMS, and chitosan–METAC
hydrogels.

Furthermore, in both unmodified
and modified chitosan polymers,
adsorption bands at 893, 942, and 1109 cm–1 are
attributed to C–O ring stretching, CH3 bending vibration,
and C–O–C stretching, respectively.65−67 Two sharp peaks
at 1488 and 1724 cm–1 in chitosan–METMAS
and chitosan–METAC polymers are assigned to asymmetric angular
bending of methyl groups of quaternary hydrogen,68 and carbonyl stretching vibration of C=O groups69,70 existed in both METMS and METAC, which confirms the polymerization
of chitosan and METMS and METAC monomers.

X-ray Diffraction Analysis
The structural properties
of chitosan before and after dissolution in acetic acid for hydrogel
formation as well as chitosan–METAC and chitosan–METMS
polymers after hydrogel formation were analyzed using an X-ray diffraction
(XRD) technique, and the results are shown in Figure 4. The XRD pattern for chitosan powder reveals
a strong peak at 2θ of 20° and one weak peak at 2θ
of 10°, which are the indicators of the existence of crystalline
and amorphous regions, respectively. The crystallinity of chitosan
is because of arranged saccharide backbone and the ordered regions
formed by amino groups on saccharide units.71−73

Figure 4 XRD pattern of chitosan
powder, chitosan hydrogel, chitosan–METAC,
and chitosan–METMS hydrogel.

The crystallinity peaks were decreased by converting chitosan powder
to hydrogel and after polymerization with METMS or METAC. These changes
are due to the significant change in chitosan’s functional
groups and decreasing the crystallinity of chitosan by converting
it into hydrogel via polymerization.73

Properties of Chitosan before and after Modification
Elemental
compositions, molecular weight, and charge density of the
samples were investigated, and the results are shown in Table 1. Chitosan–METMS and
chitosan–METAC hydrogel had 4.57 and 4.4 wt % nitrogen contents,
respectively, which were higher than that of unmodified chitosan-based
hydrogel (1.07 wt %). The increase in the nitrogen content of hydrogel
stems from the nitrogen part of METMS or METAC monomer attached to
the chitosan–METAC or −METMS polymers.74 On the other hand, chitosan–METMS and chitosan–METAC
hydrogels contained more hydrogen and less oxygen compared to unmodified
chitosan hydrogel, which is attributed to the higher proportion of
hydrogen and lower proportion of oxygen in METAC and METMS monomers
attached to the polymer.57,62 The grafting ratio
(GR) for chitosan–METMS hydrogel was 121.69% and for chitosan–METAC
was 114.5%. Based on eq 1, the GR greater than 100% would indicate that more mass of grafted
side chains than the original mass of chitosan was attached to chitosan
via the polymerization reaction. These changes confirmed the polymerization
of chitosan with METMS and METAC. Molecular weight of chitosan was
increased from 1.06 × 106 g/mol for unmodified chitosan
to 2.44 × 106 and 2.25 × 106 g/mol
for chitosan–METMS and chitosan–METAC polymers, respectively.
Chitosan–METMS polymers exhibited a higher charge density (+3.22
mequiv/g) than chitosan–METAC hydrogel (+2.88 mequiv/g). The
polydispersity index, which indicates the distribution of polymer’s
molecular weight, increased remarkably via polymerization. The polydispersity
of chitosan–METMS hydrogel was also greater than that of chitosan–METAC
hydrogel, which would ascribe the broader molecular weight distribution
of this polymer. Generally, these results confirm more effective polymerization
of METMS than METAC with chitosan.

Differential Scanning Calorimetry Analysis
The differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves of chitosan, chitosan–METMS,
and chitosan–METAC hydrogels are presented in Figure 5. The endothermic humps in
DSC curves for all of the samples at the temperature higher than 160
°C are attributed to the transition of the samples from solid
state to soft and rubbery states, that is, glass transition temperature
(Tg) of the materials, which were specifically
167, 169, and 178 °C for chitosan, chitosan–METMS, and
chitosan–METAC hydrogels, respectively.72 The increase in the chitosan–METMS and chitosan–METAC
hydrogel’ glass transition temperatures can confirm the improvement
in the thermal stability of the hydrogel.72 In one study, a similar DSC trend was reported for glutaraldehyde
cross-linked chitosan, and the endothermic peaks were observed in
the range of 130 and 155 °C.29

hydrogels.

Water Uptake Behavior of
Unmodified and Modified Chitosan Hydrogels
Figure 6a shows
the water uptake (WU) of the samples as a function of time in neutral
pH. It can be seen that the rate of WU was fast in the first minute
of the test and then slowed down. As depicted, unmodified chitosan
hydrogel’s WU increased from 239% in 1 min to 517% in 1300
min. On the other hand, chitosan–METMS absorbed 404 and 1286%
and chitosan–METAC absorbed 175 and 678% water in 1 and 1300
min, respectively. During swelling, the hydrophilic groups of hydrogel
start to absorb water and expand within the structure by forming primary
bound water.75 By completing polar groups’
hydration, hydrophobic groups in hydrogel interact with water, forming
secondary-bound water. After saturation of hydrophilic and hydrophobic
groups, the osmotic driving force of the network chain causes the
absorption of more water.75

Figure 6 WU of chitosan, chitosan–METMS,
and chitosan–METAC
hydrogels in (a) pH 3, (b) pH 7, and (c) pH 11.

It was also observed that acidic (pH 3) and alkaline (pH 11) environments
had pronounced effects on the WU profiles of hydrogels (Figure 6). In fact, the WU was more
profound in acidic environment than other media. Also, the rate of
WU was significantly lower in alkaline pH than other pH. During the
swelling of unmodified and modified chitosan hydrogels, the amino
groups located on the surface of hydrogel are ionized first. Then,
water will penetrate into the hydrogel, and this penetration is facilitated
via electrostatic repulsion created between adjacent ionized amino
groups.76 Low pH (i.e., acidic medium)
favors the protonation of amino groups in the hydrogels leading to
high repulsion and hence higher WU.76−78 On the other hand, the
slower and less amount of WU in basic environment was attributed to
the presence of the OH– group in the medium that would suppress
the protonation of amino groups and thus hinder the electrostatic
repulsion development. Similar behavior was reported for chitosan-based
hydrogels in the past.77,78

Figure 7 presents
the water swelling of unmodified chitosan, chitosan–METMS,
and chitosan–METAC hydrogels as a function of time. The water
swelling results confirm a trend similar to those of Figure 6 for WU. However, the swelling
amount was 1.43–2 times as large as the WU after 420 min. In
opposition to the WU that occurs only in an axial direction, the water
swelling results (Figure 7) provide evidence that the hydrogels had affinity to absorb
water in radical and tangential directions in addition to the axial
direction (Figure 6).79

Figure 7 Water swelling of chitosan, chitosan–METMS,
and chitosan–METAC
hydrogels.

Both WU and swelling results exhibited
the following order of chitosan–METMS
> chitosan–METAC > chitosan (Figures 6 and 7) in absorbing
water. The difference in their performance could be related to their
altered structures. The morphologies of hydrogel samples after swelling
are shown in Figure 8. It can be seen that the structure and surface pattern of the unmodified
and modified hydrogels were completely different. The surface structure
of chitosan hydrogel (Figure 8a) was smooth and uniform, whereas chitosan–METAC and
chitosan–METMS hydrogels had rougher and more porous structure
(Figure 2b,c), which
probably increased the surface area and porosity of the hydrogels
facilitating their higher WU and swelling affinity.80

and chitosan–METAC (c) hydrogels.

Kinetics
of Dye Removal
The adsorption of dye with
adsorbents is important for eliminating it from effluent.49,81 The adsorption capacity of chitosan, chitosan–METMS, and
chitosan–METAC hydrogel for reactive Y50 dye is depicted in Figure 9. Unmodified chitosan
hydrogel reached the highest performance in the dye removal after
60 min with equilibrium adsorption capacity of 60.5 mg/g dye/hydrogel.
The adsorption capacity of chitosan-METMS hydrogel was 153.5 mg/g
dye/hydrogel after 80 min and that of chitosan–METAC hydrogel
reached the capacity of 147.5 mg/g dye/hydrogel after 360 min. An
increase in the dye removal is attributed to the presence of more
available quaternary amine groups in the hydrogel structures.82,83 A similar trend was observed by Vakili and his colleagues reporting
that chitosan hydrogel modified with 3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane
removed reactive blue 4 (RB4). Also, chitosan–METMS hydrogel
adsorbed dyes more quickly than other samples. The results confirmed
that the equilibrium adsorption capacity of chitosan hydrogel on RB4
dye (500 mg/L concentration) increased 1.37 times by polymerizing
with 3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane.84

of adsorption of Y50 dye on chitosan, chitosan–METMS,
and chitosan–METAC hydrogels.

Comparison of Chitosan–METMS and Chitosan–METAC
Hydrogels
During polymerization in aqueous media, water molecules
penetrate into the interlayer space between the polyions and counter
ions in polyelectrolytes. The electrostatic charge pattern within
the colloidal system causes the adsorption of polyions to the opposite
charged materials.47,48 The ionic effect of polyelectrolytes
not only depends on the ionic groups of polyions but it also depends
on the counter ions’ properties (i.e., charge, charge distribution,
and polarizability).85 Therefore, the nature
of counter ions in polyelectrolyte can considerably influence the
properties of their polyions.86,87 Hence, two polymers
with identical polyions but different counter ions could have different
properties.44 Counter ions differ by their
polarization affinity, that is, their binding efficiency according
to the sequence of Hofmeister series.45

Two used monomers in current study have identical polyions
([2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl]trimethylammonium) and two different counter
ions, methyl sulfate and chloride for METMS and METAC, respectively.
Based on Hofmeister series, which describes the binding affinity of
anionic as SO4–2 > HPO4–2 > CH3CO– >
Cl– > Br– > NO3– > I– > SCN–,88−92 methyl sulfate has a higher binding affinity than
chloride.92,93 Thus, it neutralizes the charge of quaternary
ammonium group of the monomer more effectively, affecting the polarizability
of the monomer. This interaction will less significantly affect the
electron clouds of the carbon double bonds of the monomers participating
in the polymerization reaction. The stronger electron density of the
carbon double bond of METMS than METAC most probably led to its more
effective polymerization with chitosan, which generated a more effective
hydrogel.

Conclusions
This work presented
a process for polymerizing chitosan with monomers
of the same structure but with different counter ions to produce hydrogels.
The polymerization enhanced the charge density of chitosan from +0.88
to +3.22 and +2.88 mmol/g in chitosan–METMS and chitosan–METAC,
respectively. The molecular weight of chitosan increased almost 2
times via polymerization. The polymerization of chitosan was confirmed
by means of FTIR and XRD. DSC results showed the higher thermal and
network stability for chitosan–METMS than chitosan–METAC
due to its higher polymerization efficiency. Chitosan–METMS
and chitosan–METAC hydrogels revealed 1.7 times WU as much
as chitosan hydrogel. Polymerized chitosan hydrogel with METMS and
METAC revealed much more adsorption for reactive Y50 dye than did
chitosan hydrogel. In this case, chitosan–METMS hydrogel exhibited
higher dye adsorption capacity (153.5 mg dye/g hydrogel) and shorter
equilibrium time (80 min) than chitosan–METAC hydrogel with
146.5 mg/g of dye/hydrogel adsorption capacity and longer equilibrium
time of 360 min. Generally, hydrogels behaved differently in altered
pH, and they absorbed more water at acidic pH. Overall, the results
confirmed that the counter ion’s binding affinity, which would
impact the polarity of the cationic monomer, indeed influenced the
performance of the cationic monomer in polymerizing with chitosan
and the properties of chitosan-based hydrogels. Thus, the impact of
counter ions of the cationic monomers on hydrogel production must
be taken into account when cationic monomers are selected.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Chitosan powder (with 75–85% degree
of deacetylation and 190 000–310 000 kg/mol molecular
weight) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Also, METMS, METAC, ceric
ammonium nitrate (CAN), methanol, sodium hydroxide pellets, poly diallyldi
methylammonium, acetic acid (90 vol %), HCl (37%), sulfuric acid (98
wt %), and direct yellow 50 (Y50) dye were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
company. Potassium polyvinyl sulfate (PVSK) (with molecular weight
of 200–300 kg/mol, 98.4% esterified) was provided by Wako Pure
Chemical Industries Ltd., Japan. Cellulose acetate dialysis membrane
(molecular weight cut-off of 1000 g/mol) was purchased from Wako Chemicals,
Japan. In this research work, no unexpected or unusually high safety
hazards were encountered.

Preparation of Modified-Chitosan Hydrogel
In this set
of experiments, a 2 g sample of chitosan powder was dissolved homogeneously
in 40 mL of acetic acid (1 vol %) by stirring overnight.94 The gel-like sample was then mixed with certain
amounts of METMS or METAC in plastic bags. The mixtures were stirred
thoroughly prior to adding 0.03 g of CAN as the initiator. The mixtures
were deoxygenated under nitrogen atmosphere and then kept at 50 °C
for 5 h while mixing every 15 min. Then, they were cooled down and
precipitated by ethanol (95%) to extract modified chitosan polymer
from the reaction media. The rest of unreacted monomers were separated
from the products by membrane dialysis, while changing water every
2 h for the first 6 h and then once a day for 2 days. Thereafter,
the sample was dried using a freeze-dryer.

Afterward, unmodified
and modified chitosan-based hydrogels were prepared by dissolving
the samples in a 1% acetic acid solution via mixing overnight. Then,
the solutions were added drop-wise into an alkaline solution containing
deionized water, methanol, and sodium hydroxide with ratio of 4:5:1
(wt/wt/wt), respectively, to form hydrogels.95 The formed hydrogels were then filtered and washed thoroughly to
neutral pH.96

Charge Density Analysis
In this set of experiments,
0.2 g of freeze-dried chitosan, chitosan–METMS, and chitosan–METAC
hydrogels were dissolved in 19.8 mL of deionized water. Then, they
were incubated in a water bath shaker (Innova 3100, Brunswick Scientific,
Edison, NJ) for 1 h at the revolution of 150 rpm and temperature of
30 °C. After incubation, the samples were centrifuged for 10
min at 1000 rpm. Then, the charge density of prepared samples was
measured by a particle charge detector, Mutek, PCD 04 titrator (Herrsching,
Germany) with PVSK solution (0.0052 M).61 All experiments were carried out in triplicates, and the average
values were reported.

Elemental Analysis
The elemental
analysis was carried
out for unmodified and modified chitosan-based hydrogels to determine
their carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen contents using an elemental
analyzer, Elementar Vario EL (Germany). In preparing the sample for
this analysis, they were first oven-dried at 60 °C, and about
0.02 g of the samples was transferred into the carousel chamber of
the elemental analyzer. The combustion of the samples was performed
at 1200 °C, and the gases were reduced to analyze the elemental
content of the samples.

GR was calculated based on their nitrogen
content, according to eq 1.74 1  where N is the nitrogen content determined
by the elemental analysis (wt %) and MWm is the molecular
weight of monomer.

Molecular Weight Analysis
The molecular
weight of chitosan,
chitosan–METMS and chitosan–METAC were assessed using
a gel permeation chromatograph instrument (Malvern GPCmax VE2001 Module
+ Viscotek TDA305), which was equipped with RI and viscometer detectors
at the flow rate of 0.7 mL/min and temperature of 30 °C. The
samples were prepared by drying for 72 h using a freeze-dryer prior
to use. Then, approximately 10 mg of each sample was dissolved in
20 mL of 5.0 wt % acetic acid by stirring at 600 rpm for 48 h. Thereafter,
the solution was filtered with a nylon filter (pore size 0.2 μm)
and used for the molecular weight analysis.

Fourier Transform Infrared
The FTIR analysis was conducted
for determining the structure of chitosan and chitosan–METMS
and chitosan–METAC hydrogels. The samples were dried in an
oven at 60 °C overnight, and 0.1 g of the sample was used for
the analysis using the FTIR instrument (Bruker Tensor 37, Germany,
ATR accessory). The spectra were recorded in a transmittance mode
in the range of 590–4000 cm–1 with 32 scan
and resolution of 4 cm–1.

X-ray Diffraction
The XRD analysis was conducted on
chitosan powder, chitosan hydrogel, and chitosan–METAC and
chitosan–METMS hydrogels. The freeze-dried samples were used
in this analysis using an XRD (Panalytical X-pert Pro) with a high-resolution
goniometer and a Pixel solid-state detector. The X-ray tube contained
a copper anode and was set to 45 kV and 40 mA. The samples were set
to analyze from 6° to 96° (2θ) with a step size of
0.0263°.

Differential Scanning Calorimetry
The thermal behavior
and glass transition temperature (Tg)
of chitosan, chitosan–METMS, and chitosan–METAC hydrogels
were analyzed using a DSC, TA instruments Q2000, in standard cell
RC mode. In this set of experiments, the samples were oven-dried at
60 °C, and then, 2–5 mg of the dried samples was loaded
into a Tzero aluminium pan and analyzed via heat/cool/heat methods
in a temperature range of 50–210 °C at 50 mL/min in nitrogen.

WU and Swelling
The WU of chitosan, chitosan–METMS,
and chitosan–METAC hydrogels from their axial surface was determined
by capillary rise of water on a bed of freeze-dried hydrogel following
the Washburn theory.97 The test was performed
with 0.05 g of samples using a Sigma 700/701 optical tensiometer (Espoo,
Finland) after conditioning its temperature at 20 °C. A vessel
containing water (100 mL) was placed on the platform of the machine
and moved until water touched the sample bed, after which capillary
force caused water absorption by the sample.75 To study the effect of pH on the WU of hydrogels, the pH of water
was adjusted to 3, 7, and 11 by using 0.1 M of HCl and NaOH solutions.
The mass uptake by the hydrogel was subsequently recorded every 1
min for 1300 min. The WU of each sample at different time intervals
was calculated according to eq 2 2  where WD and WW are the weight (g) of hydrogels before and
after exposing to water at different time duration, respectively.98

The swelling experiment of unmodified
and chitosan–METMS and chitosan–METAC hydrogels was
performed manually by immersing the freeze-dried samples in deionized
water to swell. At different time intervals, the samples were removed
and blotted by paper towel to extract excess water from their surface.99 The swelling ratio of hydrogel (Q) was determined following eq 3 3  where Ws and Wo are the weights of
swollen hydrogel and dried
hydrogel, respectively.100 The WU analyzed
by the tensiometer measures the water penetration in only axial direction,
whereas the water swelling measurement includes WU in any direction
of axial, radial, and tangential.

Surface Morphology of Hydrogel
The unmodified and modified
hydrogels were swollen in water at pH 7 and room temperature for 24.
Then, they were freeze-dried and coated on gold using an EFFA coater
(Ernest F. Fullam, USA). The structures of the freeze-dried hydrogels
were analyzed using a Hitachi SU-70 scanning electron microscope (SEM)
at 10 kV under 10–4 to 10–3 Pa.

Removal of Reactive Yellow 50 Dye
Adsorption experiments
were carried out to assess the capacity of the unmodified and chitosan–METMS
and chitosan–METAC hydrogels for removing the reactive Y50
dye molecules from a simulated aqueous medium. Reactive Y50 dye solution,
which is an anionic dye, was prepared by dissolving dye powder in
deionized-distilled water (23 mg/L) at pH 2 while stirring at 300
rpm and 25 °C for 1 h.101 About 100
mg of unmodified/modified chitosan hydrogels was mixed with 50 mL
of the prepared dye solution. During the adsorption process, 5 mL
of solution was drawn out at certain time intervals and its concentration
was measured using a Genesys 10s UV–vis spectrophotometer at
the wavelength 390 nm.102 The adsorption
capacity of the hydrogels (qt, mg/g) for
Y50 dye was calculated based on the changes in dye concentrations
before and after adsorption following eq 4. 4  where q (mg/g) represents
the dye adsorption capacity and C0 (mg/L)
and Ct (mg/L) represent
the dye concentration before and after adding the hydrogel samples,
respectively. V represents volume (L) and W (wt) represents the dry weight of hydrogel samples.103,104 All experiments in this study were performed in triplicate under
identical conditions to assure the accuracy of the results.
