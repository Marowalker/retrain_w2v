Reagent-deposited
pieces of paper were characterized by the use
of a compact conductometer, a compact pH sensor, and a conventional
spectrophotometer to assess their suitability for use as reagent containers.
The pieces of paper were fabricated by wax printing to form a limited
hydrophilic area to which a consistent volume of an aqueous reagent
could be added. The pieces of paper without the reagent increased
the conductivity of water gradually because of the release of sodium
salts, whereas pH of NaOH decreased because of the acidity of the
functional groups in the paper. Three reagents, sulfamic acid as an
acid, Na2CO3 as a base, and BaCl2 as a metal salt, were deposited on the pieces of paper to evaluate
their ability to release from the pieces of paper. Sulfamic acid and
Na2CO3 were released in quantities of 58 and
73% into water after 420 s, whereas 100% of BaCl2 was released
after 480 s. The conductometric titrations of NaOH, HCl, and Na2SO4, and the spectrophotometry of Fe2+ were examined using the pieces of paper that contained sulfamic
acid, Na2CO3, BaCl2, and 1,10-phenanthroline.
Titrations using the pieces of paper suggested that the reagents were
quantitatively released into the titrant, which resulted in a linear
relationship between the endpoints and the equivalent points. In 120
s of soaking time, 60–70% of the reagents were released. The
spectrophotometric measurements of Fe2+ indicated that
when an excess amount of the reagents was deposited onto the pieces
of paper, they nonetheless sufficiently fulfilled the role of a reagent
container.

Introduction
Recent analytical techniques now address
many requirements in diverse
fields and purposes, and chemical analyses have become essential in
fields such as environmental science, pharmaceutical science, medical
science, agricultural science, and engineering. Many sophisticated
instruments are routinely employed in laboratories, whereas small
sensors and devices permit point-of-care testing (POCT), on-site field
analysis, and analysis in ill-equipped laboratories. Therefore, analytical
techniques must be based on suitability for particular purposes and
circumstances.

Miniaturization of chemical sensors and chemical
devices is a trend
in analytical chemistry that has been in evidence in the development
of microfluidic devices since the early 1990s.1,2 The
proliferation of review articles on microfluidic devices includes
topics such as bioanalysis,3 electrophoretic
separation,4 ion analysis,5,6 optical sensing,7 preconcentration,8 and real-sample analysis.9 Microfluidic devices can miniaturize the channels used in separation,
pretreatment, and detection by integrating them with small substrates,
whereas larger pumping systems, detectors, and power supplies complicate
the use of microfluidic devices in the field. Conversely, several
types of miniaturized sensors that are used for onsite analysis and
POCT have been reported and are commercially available. Miniaturized,
highly sensitive amperometric sensors have shown promise not only
for in vivo measurement10 but also in POCT
via coupling with microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (μPADs).11 However, amperometry requires equipment, such
as a personal computer and a potentiostat, that is appreciably bigger
and more expensive than μPADs. Conversely, Futagawa et al. have
developed a miniaturized conductivity sensor with platinum electrodes
on a silicon substrate, which permits measurements of electrical conductivities
ranging from 10–2 to 101 S m–1.12

As a miniaturized sensor, one
of the most suitable analytical platforms
in POCT and onsite analysis is the μPAD, which has received
much attention since the Whitesides’ group demonstrated the
measurement of multiple analytes on a piece of paper with narrow channels
fabricated by photolithography.13 μPADs
possess the characteristics of simple structure, easy fabrication,
lightweight, and inexpensive materials, so they are considered suitable
for use outside well-equipped laboratories—POCT and onsite
analysis. Many researchers have demonstrated novel μPADs that
potentially permit the determination of an analyte without the use
of other instrumentation. These techniques include detection schemes
with time-based,14,15 distance-based,16,17 and counting-based readouts.18,19 We have also reported
counting-based titration μPADs that can measure acid, base,
magnesium, and calcium concentrations.20,21 In addition,
recent publications have demonstrated several types of distance-based
readouts as seen in the determination of inorganic ions,22−24 antioxidants,25 and lactoferrin.26

Although μPADs have shown promise
in realizing onsite analysis
and POCT, sufficient sensitivity continues to require sensitive equipment.
Therefore, much effort has been invested in developing miniaturized
detection systems that include transmittance detectors27−29 and electrochemical detectors.30−32 These detectors have
the potential to enable high-performance analysis outside laboratories
because of their portability and the necessity for only small batteries.
Therefore, a suitable coupling of paper devices with small detectors
and sensors should be explored in order to achieve actual onsite analysis
and POCT.

There are many investigations on miniaturization of
the instruments,
but analytical techniques also require reagents for chemical reactions.
In many cases, reagent solutions must be prepared in a laboratory
on a large scale and transported using portable containers. Therefore,
portability of chemical reagents is also an important issue to be
resolved for achieving on-site analysis. In this study, we propose
a method to carry chemical reagents using pieces of paper that form
reagent containers. A piece of paper is lightweight, inexpensive,
and is easy to dispose of in an environmentally friendly manner. For
the present study, pieces of paper were fabricated by wax printing
and were characterized using a compact conductometer and a compact
pH sensor in order to verify their utility as a container of a solid
reagent because a small sensing volume could suppress the dilution
and permit the measurements of conductivity and pH changes due to
ions released from a small piece of paper.

In order to miniaturize
the conductometric titrations, we used
a compact conductometric sensor and pieces of paper. In the acid–base
titrations, standard solutions of NaOH and HCl were titrated with
pieces of paper containing sulfamic acid and Na2CO3, which are primary standard substances that represent acids
and bases, respectively. In the precipitation titration, a standard
sample containing SO42– in the form of
Na2SO4 was placed into a well in the sensor.
After measuring the conductivity, pieces of paper containing a titrant
were successively soaked into the sample solution to dissolve the
titrant, which either resulted in a neutralization reaction or yielded
a precipitate of BaSO4. The conductivity after soaking
each piece of paper was monitored and plotted against the amount of
the reagent deposited on the piece of paper. With this system, linear
relationships between the endpoints of the miniaturized titrations
and the equivalent points were obtained for the titrations of OH–, H+, and SO42–. In addition, Fe2+ was measured spectrophotometrically
using pieces of paper containing 1,10-phenanthroline.

Results and Discussion
Characterization
of the Paper
Initially, pieces of
paper with no reagent were characterized using a compact conductometer
and a compact pH sensor. The pieces of paper were dipped in pure water,
1 mM NaOH, and 1 mM HCl, and then the conductivity and pH changes
were monitored, as shown in Figure 1. When dipping the pieces of paper into pure water,
the conductivity gradually increased as soaking time increased (Figure 1a). The conductivity,
which was 3.3 μS cm–1 initially, increased
to 20.3 μS cm–1 after soaking a piece of paper
for 720 s. The results suggested that small amounts of electrolytes
were leached from the paper substrate into the water. We expected
the substrate to cause the release of salts that resided in the paper
from the pulping process. To confirm the release of salts, Na, K,
Mg, and Ca that resided in the water following the soaking of a sheet
of paper were determined by inductively coupled plasma–optical
emission spectrometry (ICP–OES). Paper sheets (30 × 40
mm) with and without wax printing were soaked in 10 mL of water. Both
forms of paper sheets showed Na at levels of several hundred ppb.
Interestingly, the paper sheet without wax printing released 330 ppb
of Na, whereas the version with wax printing on one surface showed
a suppressed release of Na to a level of 170 ppb. This fact suggests
that the sodium was entrapped in the wax. According to these results,
the increased conductivity was attributed to sodium salts released
from the paper.

Figure 1 Change in conductivity and pH by soaking pieces of paper
in solutions.
(a) Conductivity change by a piece of paper without reagent. (b) pH
change by pieces of paper without reagent. The concentrations of HCl
and NaOH were 1 mM in (b).

Figure 1b shows
the pH changes when pieces of paper with no reagent were soaked in
water, 1 mM HCl, and 1 mM NaOH. Each piece of paper was soaked in
each solution for 120 s. Water and HCl solution exhibited a negligible
decrease in pH of less than 0.05 following soaking of each piece.
pH of the NaOH solution was significantly decreased by more than 0.2
following soaking of each piece (Figure 1b). We also assessed the influence that the
pieces of paper had on the conductivity of 1 mM NaOH. The conductivity
of NaOH decreased gradually and then reached a constant value with
the increase in the number of pieces of paper. According to these
results, the paper substrates contain acidic functional groups that
neutralize OH– in a strongly basic solution, although
the dissociation constant was too small to release H+ into
either water or 1 mM HCl solution.

Subsequently, we investigated
reagent-deposited pieces of paper
using 50 nmol solutions of sulfamic acid, Na2CO3, or BaCl2. Changes in conductivity were monitored when
the pieces of paper were soaked in water and the results were compared
with the changes in conductivity caused by the addition of the solutions
(5 μL). Figure 2 shows the amount of reagents released into water as a function of
the soaking time where the conductivity change expected by a complete
release of the reagent was estimated based on the conductivity from
the addition of the solution, which is represented by straight lines.
The amount of the reagents released into water varied depending on
the reagent type. Sulfamic acid and Na2CO3 were
released incompletely and reached a plateau after a soaking time of
420 s, whereas BaCl2 was dissolved completely in water
following an extended soaking time of 480 s. The released amounts
were estimated to be 58% for sulfamic acid and 73% for Na2CO3. These results suggest that the releasable amounts
must be standardized for each reagent because the amounts and the
time needed to dissolve each reagent depends on its type.

Figure 2 The effect
of soaking time on conductivity for pieces of paper
with reagents. Each piece of paper contained the reagent [(a) sulfamic
acid, (b) Na2CO3, or (c) BaCl2] at
50 nmol. Dotted lines indicate the expected conductivity when 50 nmol
of the reagents were dissolved in water completely.

Conductometric Titrations
In order to quantify the
amount of reagent released from the pieces of paper, different concentrations
of NaOH, HCl, and Na2SO4 were titrated with
reagent-deposited pieces of paper containing sulfamic acid, Na2CO3, and BaCl2, respectively. Typical
titration curves are shown in Figure 3 where a constant soaking time of 120 s was used to
reduce the time needed to complete the titrations. As indicated in
the titration curves, the endpoints were shifted to overestimated
amounts due to expectations of an incomplete release. Titrations using
the pieces of paper capably quantified the analytes, as summarized
in Table 1, because
the relationship between all equivalent points and the endpoints showed
good linearity. The pieces of paper released constant amount of the
titrant during a consistent amount of soaking time. According to the
slope of the linear relationships in Table 1, the pieces of paper released sulfamic acid,
Na2CO3, and BaCl2 at 60–70%
of the total amount deposited (the slope for HCl should be divided
by 2 because Na2CO3 is a divalent base). The
linear relationship indicates that the pieces of paper accomplished
miniaturized titrations with the need for neither a large volume of
titrant nor a lot of glassware, although the amount of the titrant released from each piece
of paper had to be calibrated for the analyte similar to establishing
a secondary standard in conventional titrations.

Figure 3 Typical titration curves.
(a) Titration of NaOH with sulfamic acid,
(b) titration of HCl with Na2CO3, and (c) titration
of Na2SO4 with BaCl2. Concentrations
of titrands: 1.9 mM NaOH, 2.0 mM HCl, and 1.0 mM Na2SO4. Volume of the titrands, 100 μL. The pieces of paper
contained 50 nmol of the titrant.

Table 1 Relationship between the Endpoint
of the Titration and the Equivalent Pointa

Na2SO4	50–200	BaCl2	y = 0.602x – 1.428	0.9988	
a x: endpoint (nmol); y: equivalent point (nmol).

The titration curve for NaOH
seems slightly strange because the
conductivity is almost constant around the endpoint. This type of
a titration curve can be seen when the titrand contains both a strong
base and a weak base. It would be plausible to attribute this result
to the weak acid on the paper substrate being neutralized by NaOH,
and the resultant weak base would then dissolve into the titrand solution.

Absorption Spectrophotometry of Fe2+
It
is noteworthy that the dilution effect can be excluded when using
reagent-deposited pieces of paper. In other words, chemical reagents
could be added to a solution without dilution. Therefore, paper containers
are also useful for pH control and for chemical reactions in onsite
analyses when the pieces of paper are prepared containing buffer components
and reactants. To demonstrate the utility of the paper containers,
we applied the method of absorption spectrophotometry. A photo of
the solutions after soaking the pieces of paper containing hydroxylamine
hydrochloride and 1,10-phenanthroline hydrochloride is shown in Figure 4. The calibration
curve shows good linearity for concentrations ranging from 10 to 50
μM Fe with r2 = 0.9997. It should
be noted that 2 mL of sample solutions represent rough measurements,
which is why the levels of the solutions appear different in the cuvettes.
This would be an advantage for paper containers with a negligible
dilution of a sample solution. Sample solutions need not be precise
in so far as the paper container releases excess amount of the reagents.
The potential applicability to on-site analyses would make spectrometric
measurements using the reagent-deposited pieces of paper more attractive
for coupling with miniaturized photometric detectors.29,33,34

Figure 4 Reaction of Fe(II) with 1,10-phenanthroline
deposited on the pieces
of paper. Standard solutions of Fe(II) were placed in disposable cuvettes
at volumes of roughly 2 mL. The pieces of paper containing 3 μmol
of hydroxylamine hydrochloride and 3 μmol of 1,10-phenanthroline
hydrochloride were soaked in the cuvettes.

Conclusions
Herein, we proposed novel hydrophilic paper
containers that have
reagents deposited on their surface and can simplify the onsite analysis
of analyte reactions. These paper containers were characterized using
a commercially available compact conductometer and a pH sensor. The
applicability of the paper containers with reagents sulfamic acid,
Na2CO3, and BaCl2 was validated in
conductometric titrations of NaOH, HCl, and Na2SO4, respectively. The titrations were achieved by soaking the paper
container with 100 μL of a titrand solution filled in the sample
reservoir, which was then removed after 120 s. Reliable results were
obtained for standard samples using the paper containers when the
endpoints were correlated with the expected equivalent points. Colorimetric
reagents for the measurement of Fe(II) were also deposited on the
surface of the paper containers to allow reaction with the analyte
in sample solutions, which was then followed by a measurement of absorbance.
An additional advantage was realized when it became apparent that
a precise volume of the sample solution was unnecessary, which negates
dilution considerations and further increases the usefulness of the
paper containers for conductometric titrations, pretreatments of samples,
and chemical reactions of analytes during onsite analyses. Further
applications should expand the utility of this system for onsite analysis
and POCT.

Experimental Section
Materials
Analytical-grade reagents
were used in this
experiment. Deionized water (18.2 MΩ·cm) purified using
a Milli-Q System from Merck Millipore (Millipore Co. Ltd., Molsheim,
France) was used for standard and reagent preparations. Sodium sulfate
(Na2SO4) and barium chloride (BaCl2) were ordered from Kanto Chemical (Tokyo, Japan). Other chemicals
were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industrials, Ltd. (Osaka, Japan).
The stock solutions were prepared with 1 M concentrations of deionized
water.

Fabrication of Paper-Based Reagent Containers
Paper-based
reagent containers (paper containers) were fabricated using the following
procedure: a sheet of Whatman 1CHR chromatography paper (GE Healthcare
Life Science, England) was printed by using a wax printer (ColorQube
8580N, Xerox, USA) using the design shown in Figure 5a where each piece of paper was composed
of a printed 40 × 5 mm rectangular portion and an unprinted 4.5
× 3.5 mm rectangular portion for the measurements of conductivity
and pH, and a printed 50 × 8 mm rectangular portion and an unprinted
8 × 6 mm rectangular portion for spectrophotometry. The printed
paper sheets were heated at 120 °C for 120 s in an oven to create
a hydrophobic barrier. Subsequently, one side of each paper sheet
was again processed through the wax printer to enhance the hydrophobic
surface and to prevent leakage of the reagent solutions from the bottom
(Figure 5b), and then
each piece was cut and formed to construct the individual paper containers.

Measurements of Conductivity,
pH, and Metal Ions
A
commercially available compact conductometer and a pH sensor (LAQUAtwin
Sensor, HORIBA, Tokyo, Japan) were employed to characterize the paper
containers with and without the reagents. The paper containers were
soaked in solutions that filled the reservoir of either the compact
conductometer or the pH sensor. The volumes of the solution added
to the reservoirs were fixed at 100 μL for the conductometer
and 1 mL for the pH sensor. The maximum volumes of the sensing reservoirs
were 120 μL for the conductometer and 2 mL for the pH sensor.

To characterize the ability to release a reagent deposited on the
pieces of paper, 5 μL of the reagent solution was dropped onto
the hydrophilic white area of each paper container and allowed to
dry for 40 min at room temperature. Conductometric titrations were
carried out as follows: 100 μL of a sample solution was placed
into the sample reservoir of the compact conductometer. After measuring
the initial conductivity of the sample solution in the conductometer,
a piece of paper container was soaked in the sample solution for 120
s and then the conductivity of the sample solution was measured again.
The operation was repeated until there was a distinct increase in
conductivity. The measured conductivity values were plotted against
the amount of the titrant deposited on the paper containers in order
to determine the endpoint.

Inorganic salts released from the
paper sheets were determined
by ICP–OES (Vista Pro, Seiko Instruments, Inc., Tokyo, Japan).
A 40 × 30 mm paper sheet was soaked in 10 mL of water. Four elements,
Na, K, Mg, and Ca, were selected as candidates of metal ions to be
released from paper. Calibration curves were constructed for concentrations
that ranged from 0 to 2 ppm for each element.

To measure Fe(II)
via conventional spectrophotometry, two different
reagent containers were prepared by adding 60 μL of 0.05 M hydroxylamine
hydrochloride and 60 μL of 0.05 M 1,10-phenanthroline hydrochloride
to the hydrophilic zones of pieces of paper followed by drying at
room temperature. Standard solutions of 10, 25, 40, and 50 μM
of Fe(II) were placed into disposable cuvettes at a volume of about
2 mL, and then the pieces of paper were soaked in the cuvettes. After
45 min, the pieces of paper were removed and the absorbance at 510
nm was measured via spectrophotometer (UV-2400PC, Shimadzu, Kyoto,
Japan).
