In this article, a series of novel
Mn4+-doped Ba2GdTaO6 (BGT) red-emitting
phosphors were successfully synthesized via a high-temperature solid-state
method. The crystal structure, morphology, and luminescent performance
of the samples were investigated in detail with X-ray diffraction,
field emission scanning electron microscopy, photoluminescence (PL)
spectra, decay curves, and internal quantum efficiency (IQE). Excited
at 358 nm, these samples showed an intense deep-red emission band
peaking at 688 nm in the wavelength region of 620–800 nm. The
excitation spectra of these samples monitored at 688 nm exhibited
two broad excitation bands from 250 to 600 nm with peaks at 358 and
469 nm. The systematic investigation of the concentration-dependent
PL properties of BGT:Mn4+ phosphors revealed that the deep-red
emission intensity reached the maximum when the Mn4+ doping
concentration was 0.6 mol %. The critical distance (Rc) between Mn4+ ions for concentration quenching
was 36.57 Å, and the major mechanism of energy transfer among
Mn4+ activators in BGT:Mn4+ was dipole–dipole
interaction. The decay lifetimes decreased from 0.285 to 0.248 ms
with the increasing Mn4+ doping concentration from 0.2
to 1.2 mol %. The Commission Internationale de l’Éclairage
coordinates of the optimal BGT:0.6%Mn4+ sample were (0.7294,
0.2706). The values of the IQE for all BGT:Mn4+ samples
were measured, and the highest value could reach up to 62%. The above
results revealed that these high-efficiency BGT:Mn4+ deep-red-emitting
phosphors had promising potential for application in indoor plant
growth lighting.

1 Introduction
It is well known that
light is the basic factor of plant growth and development.1 Light can not only provide the energy needed
for plant photosynthesis but also regulate plant life activities,
such as seed germination, seedling formation, flowering, bearing,
and other processes.2 Therefore, plant
illumination technology is an indispensable part of modern agricultural
development; especially for areas lacking land resources and light
conditions, plant illumination is particularly important.3 As reported previously, the blue light around
450 nm (410–500 nm) and red light around 660 nm (610–700
nm) are important for photosynthesis, phototropism, and photomorphogenesis.4−7 At present, the light-emitting diodes (LEDs) possess many advantages,
such as energy savings, low cost, high efficiency, environmental friendliness,
and long lifetimes, and could be considered as the main type of light
source for both general lighting and plant growth lighting.8−18 According to the current situation, searching for phosphors with
bright red emission for plant growth lighting is imperative.

Recently, non-rare-earth transitional-metal Mn4+ ions,
which could serve as efficient luminescent activators with a strong
absorption in the range of 250–600 nm and an intense red emission
covering the region from 600 to 800 nm, were widely investigated for
developing new red phosphors.3,5,19−30 Generally, Mn4+ ions can be stable in the host matrix
with an octahedral environment.31−33 Double perovskite structure is
regarded as an outstanding host material for Mn4+ activators
on account of its different crystal structures, excellent optical
properties, and good chemical stability.34−36 Previously,
our group has reported several red phosphors based on Mn4+-activated double perovskite compounds, including Ca2GdTaO6:Mn4+, KLaMgWO6:Mn4+, NaLaMgWO6:Mn4+, BaLaMgSbO6:Mn4+, Ca2GdSbO6:Mn4+, and BaLaMgNbO6:Mn4+.34,37−41 To the best of our knowledge, the luminescence properties
of the Mn4+-doped Ba2GdTaO6 (BGT)
double perovskite have not been reported until now. The BGT compound
would be a good host material for Mn4+ ion doping because
it has abundant [TaO6] octahedrons that are favorable for
Mn4+ ions to replace Ta5+ ion sites.42 Accordingly, in this work, we reported on the
luminescence properties of BGT:Mn4+ phosphors, which were
synthesized using the conventional high-temperature solid-state reaction
method. The crystal structure, morphology, optical properties, decay
curves, and internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of the BGT:Mn4+ phosphors were systematically investigated and discussed. Our results
demonstrated that the as-prepared BGT:Mn4+ phosphors were
efficient deep-red-emitting luminescent materials for indoor plants
growth LEDs.

2 Results and Discussion
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the BGT:xMn4+ (x = 0.2, 0.6, and 1.2 mol %) samples
are displayed in Figure 1. It could be seen that all of the diffraction peaks of these samples
were completely matched with those of the standard JCPDS card of the
BGT compound (no. 49-1900). Furthermore, other impurity phases were
not found. The experimental results indicated that single-phase BGT:Mn4+ phosphors were successfully synthesized and doping of the
Mn4+ ions into the BGT host had no substantial effect on
the BGT structure.

Figure 1 XRD patterns of BGT:xMn4+ (x = 0.2, 0.6, and 1.2%) phosphors and the standard diffraction
positions of the BGT compound (JCPDS no. 49-1900).

Figure 2a
presents Rietveld XRD refinement of BGT:0.6%Mn4+ phosphors.
The values of Rp, Rwp, and χ2 were determined to be 7.74%, 11.71%,
and 0.5308, respectively. The results implied that the refined results
were of good quality. Figure 2b shows the crystal structure of the BGT:0.6%Mn4+ sample. BGT:Mn4+ was crystallized into a tetragonal system
with the space group I4/m. The Gd3+ and Ta5+ ions were surrounded by six O2– ions to form the [TaO6] octahedrons. The Ba2+ ions were located in the middle of the gap between octahedrons.
The obtained experimental cell parameters for the BGT:0.6%Mn4+ sample were calculated to be a = b = 6.00416(6) Å, c = 8.52159(16) Å, α
= β = γ = 90°, V = 307.202(5) Å3, N = 2. Given that the Mn4+ ions
prefer to occupy the octahedral and distorted octahedral sites and
the ionic radius of the Mn4+ ions (r =
0.53 Å, coordination number (CN) = 6) was much closer to that
of the Ta5+ ions (r = 0.64 Å, CN
= 6) than that of the Gd3+ ions (r = 0.94
Å, CN = 6), so the Mn4+ ions could easily enter the
Ta5+ octahedral sites in the BGT host.43

The scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) image and the corresponding elemental mapping profiles of BGT:0.6%Mn4+ phosphors are displayed in Figure 3. Obviously, the particle size of BGT:0.6%Mn4+ powders ranged between 1 and 3 μm, as shown in Figure 3a. The elemental
mapping profiles shown in Figure 3b–f suggest that the Ba, Gd, Ta, O, and Mn elements
are uniformly distributed over the whole samples.

Figure 4a exhibits
the room-temperature photoluminescence (PL) and the PL excitation
(PLE) spectra of the BGT:0.6%Mn4+ sample. The PLE spectrum
recorded at 688 nm emission consisted of two broad excitation bands
from 250 to 600 nm, with peaks at 358 and 469 nm. The excitation spectrum
could be well-fitted into four Gaussian bands around 354, 390, 448,
and 521 nm, which were attributed to the Mn–O charge-transfer
band and the Mn4+ spin-allowed transitions of 4A2g → 4T1g, 4A2g → 2T2g, and 4A2g → 4T2g, respectively.44,45 Under excitation at 358 nm, the BGT:0.6%Mn4+ sample exhibited
an intense deep-red emission band in the wavelength range of 620–800
nm, with three emission peaks at 662, 674, and 688 nm, which can be
assigned to the spin-forbidden 2Eg → 4A2g transition of the Mn4+ ions.46,47 Among these emission peaks, the 688 nm emission peak showed the
strongest intensity. Figure 4b shows the Commission Internationale de l’Éclairage
(CIE) diagram of BGT:0.6%Mn4+ phosphors. The CIE chromaticity
coordinates of the BGT:0.6%Mn4+ sample were calculated
to be (0.7294, 0.2706), which were located in the deep-red region.
The corresponding digital photograph of the BGT:0.6%Mn4+ sample under a 365 nm UV lamp is shown in the inset of Figure 4b. Clearly, the phosphors
emitted bright red light.

Figure 5a shows the
PLE spectra of BGT:xMn4+ phosphors (x = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, and 1.2 mol %) at different
Mn4+ doping concentrations monitored at 688 nm. It can
be seen that the PLE spectra of all samples did not change significantly
except for the PLE intensity. Figure 5b shows the corresponding PL spectra of the BGT:xMn4+ (x = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8,
1.0, and 1.2 mol %) samples upon 358 nm excitation. All of the PL
spectra of these samples were similar to each other except for the
PL intensity. The PL intensity of BGT:xMn4+ phosphors increased first with increasing Mn4+ ion concentration,
approached a maximum at x = 0.6%, and then dropped
as x exceeded 0.6%, as observed in Figure 5c. This phenomenon was known
as the concentration quenching effect, which was caused by the energy
transfer between the nearest Mn4+ ions.48 The critical transfer distance (Rc) between the Mn4+ ions in BGT:Mn4+ phosphors
can be estimated by the following formula49−51 1  where V is to the unit cell volume, Xc is the
critical doping concentration, and N is the number
of available sites for the dopant in the unit cell. For BGT:Mn4+ phosphors, Xc = 0.6%, V = 307.202(5) Å3, and N = 2, respectively. The Rc value was
determined to be 36.57 Å, which was much higher than 5 Å.
Hence, it was inferred that the energy transfer mechanism of the Mn4+ ions in the BGT host was dominated by the electric multipolar
interaction because the exchange interaction works only at shorter
distances (Rc < 5 Å).52 To further confirm the detailed interaction
mechanism between the Mn4+ ions, the relationship between
log(I/x) and log(x) could be expressed by the following equation53 2  where I is the emission intensity of BGT:Mn4+ phosphors; x is the concentration of the
Mn4+ ions; and K and β are the constants
for the same excitation condition. An index of the electric multipolar
character, θ = 6, 8, and 10 correspond to the dipole–dipole,
dipole–quadrupole, and quadrupole–quadrupole interactions,
respectively.54−56Figure 5d depicts the dependence of log(I/x) on log(x). It was observed that the slope of the
fitted straight line (−θ/3) was −1.6036, thus
the value of θ was 4.8108. The value of θ was approximately
6, suggesting that the major concentration quenching mechanism in
BGT:Mn4+ phosphors was electric dipole–dipole reaction.

PL intensity on Mn4+ doping concentration in BGT:xMn4+ phosphors. (d) Linear fitting of log(x) versus log(I/x) in

Figure 6 shows the
decay curves of the 688 nm deep-red emissions of BGT:xMn4+ phosphors (x = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8,
1.0, and 1.2 mol %) under 358 nm excitation, which could be well-fitted
into double exponential decay model function below57 3  where It is the luminescence intensity
of BGT:xMn4+ phosphors at time t; A1 and A2 are constants; and τ1 and τ2 are the short and long lifetimes for the exponential components,
respectively. As a consequence, the average lifetime τs could be calculated by the following equation58 4  The decay lifetimes were found to be 0.285, 0.283,
0.272, 0.268, 0.257, and 0.248 ms for x = 0.2, 0.4,
0.6, 0.8, 1.0, and 1.2 mol %, respectively, as shown in Figure 6. As we can see, the values
of the decay times were in the microsecond range, meaning that the
luminescence was caused by the forbidden transition in the intra-d-shell
of the Mn4+ ions.49,59 Distinctly, the decay
times gradually decreased with x increasing from
0.2 to 1.2 mol %, which was due to the increased possibility of a
nonradiative energy migration between the Mn4+ ions with
increasing Mn4+ concentration.60

under 358 nm excitation and monitored at 688 nm emission.

Under 358 nm excitation, the IQE of the BGT:0.6%Mn4+ sample was measured using an integrating sphere, as shown in Figure 7a, which could be
calculated by the following equation61 5  where η is the IQE; LS is the emission spectrum of the sample; and ES and ER are the
spectra of the excitation light with the BGT:0.6%Mn4+ sample
and only with BaSO4 reference, respectively. Thus, the
calculated IQE was 44%, which was higher than that of the recently
reported Mn4+-activated red-emitting phosphors, such as
Mg7Ga2GeO12:Mn4+ (IQE:
28.13%), La(MgTi)1/2O3:Mn4+ (IQE:
27.2%), and SrLaScO4:Mn4+ (IQE: 12.2%).62−64 Furthermore, we also measured the IQEs for other samples of BGT:xMn4+ phosphors using the same integrating sphere
method. As shown in Figure 7b, the IQE values of BGT:xMn4+ phosphors (x = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, and 1.2
mol %) under 358 nm excitation were calculated to be about 62, 52,
44, 41, 32, and 24%, respectively.

1.0, and 1.2 mol %) under 358 nm excitation.

Finally, we compared the as-prepared BGT:0.6%Mn4+ phosphors
with several reported Mn4+-activated perovskite-type red-emitting
phosphors. Their host materials, optimal Mn4+ doping concentrations,
PL and PLE peaks, and IQEs are shown in Table 1. It can be seen that BGT:0.6%Mn4+ phosphors had a higher IQE and better PL properties than other phosphors.
These results further demonstrated that the as-prepared BGT:0.6%Mn4+ phosphors with outstanding optical properties could be applied
in plant growth LEDs.

3 Conclusions
In summary, Mn4+-activated BGT deep-red-emitting phosphors
have been synthesized by a high-temperature solid-state reaction method.
The excitation spectra showed broad excitation bands in the wavelength
region of 250–600 nm, which matched well with the emission
of the commercial near-UV LED chips. The PL spectra presented a deep-red
emission band with a maximum at 688 nm. The optimized doping concentration
of Mn4+ in the BGT host was determined to be 0.6 mol %.
The critical distance (Rc) of concentration
quenching was found to be 36.57 Å, and the concentration quenching
phenomenon was caused by the dipole–dipole interaction-based
energy transfer among the Mn4+ centers. The CIE chromaticity
coordinates of the BGT:0.6%Mn4+ sample were calculated
to be (0.7294, 0.2706). The IQE value of BGT:Mn4+ phosphors
reached as high as 62%. Finally, all results indicated that BGT:Mn4+ phosphors were potential candidates for deep-red phosphors
for indoor plants growth LEDs.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Sample Preparation
The powder samples with the general
formula of Ba2GdTa1-xO6:xMn4+ (x = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, and 1.2 mol %) were synthesized by a
high-temperature solid-state reaction method. The stoichiometric amounts
of raw materials including BaCO3 (analytical reagent, AR;
Tianjin Dingshengxin Chemical Industry Co., Ltd), Gd2O3 (99.99%; Jining Tianyi New Materials Co., Ltd), Ta2O5 (99.5%; Aladdin Chemical Reagent Company), and MnCO3 (AR; Tianjin Sailboats Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd) were weighed
accurately and ground thoroughly in an agate mortar. Then, the obtained
mixtures were presintered at 600 °C for 3 h and then resintered
at 1500 °C for 6 h. Finally, the samples were cooled slowly to
room temperature naturally in the furnace and ground again into powder
for subsequent characterization.

4.2 Sample
Characterizations
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of
the samples were identified using a Bruker D8 X-ray diffractometer
with a Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) in the range
of 10–80°. The morphologies of the samples were characterized
using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM; TESCAN
MAIA3). The PL and PLE spectra, as well as the decay curves, of the
as-obtained phosphors were plotted using an Edinburgh FS5 spectrometer
equipped with a 150 W continued-wavelength xenon lamp and a pulsed
xenon lamp, respectively. The IQE values of the BGT:Mn4+ samples were measured using an Edinburgh FS5 spectrometer equipped
with an integrating sphere coated with BaSO4.
