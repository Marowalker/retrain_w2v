Early
metal complexes supported by hemilabile, monoanionic di(pyridyl)
pyrrolide ligands substituted with mesityl and anthracenyl groups
were synthesized to probe the possibility of second coordination sphere
arene−π interactions with ligands with potential for
allosteric control in coordination chemistry, substrate activation,
and olefin polymerization. Yttrium alkyl, indolide, and amide complexes
were prepared and structurally characterized; close contacts between
the anthracenyl substituents and Y-bound ligands are observed in the
solid state. Titanium, zirconium, and hafnium tris(dimethylamido)
complexes were synthesized, and their ethylene polymerization activity
was tested. In the solid state structure of one of the Ti tris(dimethylamido)
complexes, coordination of Ti to only one of the pyridine donors is
observed pointing to the hemilabile character of the di(pyridyl) pyrrolide
ligands.

Introduction
The use of secondary
coordination sphere interactions in transition-metal
ancillary ligand design has recently emerged as a powerful strategy
to modulate the behavior of the resulting complexes and catalysts.1 Incorporation of hydrogen bond donor groups has
been reported to support metal oxo and hydroxo (A, Figure 1),1a,1b,2 nitrite activation,3 CO2 reduction,4 and other
reactivity.5 Ligands appended with Lewis
acidic moieties have also been reported to promote hydrazine bonding
at Fe,6 reductive CO coupling (B),7 selective alkyne hydrogenation,8 and other small molecule activation.9 Lewis base incorporation into the secondary coordination
sphere of Fe complexes for N2 reduction,10 Ni catalysts for proton reduction (C),11 and Co water oxidation catalysts12 has reported to change catalyst selectivity
and activity. Finally, the use of the combination of pendant Lewis
acids and Lewis bases has been reported as a strategy for stabilization
of hydrazine binding at V (D).13

Figure 1 Examples
of ligands incorporating secondary coordination sphere
effects including hydrogen bond donors (A), Lewis acids
(B), Lewis bases (C), and a combination
of pendant Lewis acids and bases (D).

One type of potential interaction, which has been under-explored
in the literature, is the use of π interactions through incorporation
of pendant π-systems into the ancillary ligands (Figure 2).14 Terpyridine (terpy) ligands are an example of a ligand framework
in which incorporation of such motifs can lead to π–π
interactions with additional ligands (Figure 2). Lehn and co-workers demonstrated that
incorporation of pyrene groups into the terpy ligand results in formation,
upon metal binding, of heteroligated Zn complex E, which
displays average distances of 3.50 Å between the pyrene units
and the other terpy ligand,15 and homoligated
Cu complex F displaying average distances of 3.50 Å
between the pyrene units and the plane of the terpy backbone.16 Chan and co-workers also demonstrated that incorporation
of both 2,6-dimethoxyphenyl, G, and anthracenyl, H, groups on to the terpy backbone can be used to selectively
prepare the heteroligated complexes as a consequence of the favorable
electronics of π-stacking in these cases.17 Despite these and other18 examples
of arene-appended terpy ligands displaying favorable π–π
interactions in the solid state, monoligated complexes, in the absence
of additional ligands bearing extended π-systems, do not display
parallel aryl substituents in the solid state19 as a consequence of the central six-membered pyridine donor.

Figure 2 Examples of
terpyridine-supported complexes displaying π–π
interactions in the solid state as reported by Lehn and co-workers
(E and F), Chan and co-workers (G and H), and an example of a crystallographically characterized
di(pyridyl) pyrrolide complex bearing arene substituents by Yi and
co-workers (I).

The use of di(pyridyl) ligands bearing a central five-membered
substituent was hypothesized to enhance the ability of flanking aryl
substituents to interact with incoming substrates in directed X–H
bond activation and olefin polymerization (Figure 3). The di(pyridyl) pyrrolide (DPP) backbone,
in particular, was thought to be suitable for supported early transition-metal
complexes as a consequence of its monoanionic charge. Pyrrolide groups
can also bind μ2 through the nitrogen and η5 through the pi system.20 Ti, Zr,
and Hf complexes bearing related pyrrolide imine and pyrrolide amine
ancillary ligands have been previously shown to be competent for ethylene
polymerization.20n,21 Unsubstituted (dpp) ligands have
received attention in the literature as ligands for Ag,22 Cu,22,23 Fe,24 Co,25 Ru,26 La,27 and Pd;26a,28 however, only those bearing phenyl and 2-thienyl substituents, I (Figure 3),29 have been reported where the DPP
substituents could interact with the π-systems of incoming substrates.
Such interactions are not observed between the phenyl and 2-thienyl
substituents and in the solid-state structures of I.

Figure 3 Di(pyridyl)pyrrolide
ligands bearing flanking aryl groups for second
coordination sphere π interactions with ligands.

Herein, we report a series of Al, Y, Ti, Zr, and Hf complexes
supported
by arene-appended di(pyridyl)pyrrolide ligands, which display C–H−π,
Cl−π, and π–π interactions in the
solid state. Furthermore, the reactivity of the Ti, Zr, and Hf complexes
in ethylene polymerization upon activation with AlMe3 and
[CPh3][B(C6F5)4] is reported.

Results
and Discussion
Aryl-substituted dipyridyl pyrrole proligands
were synthesized
by Suzuki cross-coupling of the previously reported (DPPBr)H (1)30 with the corresponding
boronic acid or ester as shown in Scheme 1. 2-Mesitylboronic acid and 9-anthracenylboronic
acid were synthesized from the corresponding aryl bromides according
to the literature.31 The 10-tri(iso-propyl)silylethyl-substituted anthracene boronic ester
(3) was prepared from the corresponding bromide (2)32 via lithium–halogen
exchange and quenched with trimethylborate. Suzuki coupling of 1 with the corresponding boronic acid or boronic ester affords
the aryl-substituted proligands (DPPmes)H (4), (DPPanth)H (5), and (DPPanthSiiPr3)H (6), which were isolated in good
yields.

the Previously Reported (DPPBr)H (1)30
Yttrium bis(tetramethyldisilylazide) complexes were prepared by
the reaction of the pyrrole proligands with Y(N(SiMe2H)2)3(THF) in C6H6 at elevated
temperatures (Scheme 2). In comparison with 7, 8 features an
upfield-shifted Si–H resonance by 3.7 ppm and an upfield-shifted
Si–CH3 resonance by 0.48 ppm, consistent with increased
shielding by the more extended π-system of the anthracenyl substituent.33 X-ray quality crystals of 8 were
obtained by slow cooling of a saturated benzene solution (Figure 4). Crystals with
two unit cells were observed from the same crystallization; however,
initial solutions indicated formation of similar trigonal bipyramidal C2V complexes (τ5 = 0.01 to 0.05).34 Two molecules of 8 are observed in the asymmetric unit of the higher-quality
structure; in both, Y is located near equidistant to the pyridine
donors, with Y–N(Py) distances in a range of 2.643 (4) to 2.706
(3) Å and Y–N(pyrrole) distances in a range of 2.266 (3)
to 2.245 (3) Å. Angles of 33.4o and 31.4o are observed between the anthracenyl groups; such distortion is
likely a consequence of the size of the tetramethyldisilylazide groups.

Scheme 2 Preparation of Bis(tetramethyldisilylazide)yttrium
Complexes Supported
by the Dipyridylpyrrolide Ligand and Subsequent DPP Transmetallation
upon Treatment with AlR3
Treatment of 7 with AlMe3 or AlEt3 leads to formation of new metal alkyl-containing species. The product
of the reaction of 7 with AlEt3 was identified
as the four-coordinate diethylaluminum complex 10 (τ4 = 0.88; Figure 5)35 by X-ray crystallography and independent
synthesis. A distance of 2.885 (2) Å from Al (1) to N (3) of
the free pyridine is observed, which is within the sum of van der
Waals radii (3.91 Å).36 Comparison
of the 1H NMR spectra of the products of the reaction of 7 with AlMe3 and AlEt3 with the products
of the reactions of 4 with AlMe3 and AlEt3 indicates formation of the same species in both reactions
(Figures S13 and S14). Such ancillary ligand
transmetallation from Y to Al has been observed in a number of other
systems including in related iminopyrrolide complexes.37

(8); N2-Al1-C36 117.90 (10); N2-Al1-C36 117.12 (9).

Reaction of 6 with Y(CH2SiMe3)3(THF)2 in thawing hexanes over 40
min affords
a red-brown species with NMR features consistent with C2V Y(CH2SiMe3)2(THF) complex 12 (Scheme 3). An upfield-shifted doublet is observed
in the 1H NMR spectrum at −2.33 ppm (2JYH = 2.4 Hz), which is assigned to the
methylene protons of the CH2SiMe3 groups; the
CH2SiMe3 resonance is observed at 29.41 ppm
(1JYC = 31.0 Hz) in the 13C NMR. X-ray quality crystals were grown by slow evaporation
of a pentane solution of the complex at −35 °C (Figure 6). The DPP ligand
binds meridionally with a short Y–N(pyrrolide) distance of
2.259 (2) Å and two long Y–N(pyr) distances of 2.591 (2)
and 2.563 (2) Å. The two CH2SiMe3 groups
are located trans to one another, and the coordination sphere is filled
with THF bound between the two anthracenyl substituents. Distances
of 3.64 and 3.46 Å are observed between the oxygen of the bound
THF and the planes of the two anthracenyl substituents, consistent
with C–H−π interactions between the THF and the
ligand substituents.

Scheme 3 Synthesis and Reactivity of (Dialkyl)yttrium Complex 12
Reaction of 12 with excess trimethylsilylacetylene
upon heating to 55 °C for 1.25 h affords a new C2V symmetric species with NMR features
consistent with 13. In comparison with the starting material, 13 features an upfield-shifted pyrrole resonance at 6.96 ppm
in the 1H NMR and broad resonances at 1.48 and 1.00 ppm
corresponding to the bound THF group. The trimethylsilyl resonance
of the bound acetylide is shifted to 0.04 ppm from 0.11 ppm in the
free alkyne, while the 13C resonances of the C≡C-SiMe3 unit are observed as doublets at 171.37 ppm (1JYC = 48.83 Hz) and 108.38 ppm (2JYC = 8.42 Hz). Reaction of 12 with aromatic substrates such as benzene, phenanthrene,
and 2,3,4,5,5-pentafluorotoluene was attempted; however, decomposition
with loss of SiMe4 and THF was observed to initially form
a species with a set of two doublets of doublets centered at −2.07
and – 2.53 ppm (1JHH = 11.6 Hz, 2JYH = 3.3 Hz)
corresponding to a species bearing a single CH2SiMe3 group with loss of symmetry between the two pyridine donors.
MeOD quench of this species leads to deuterium incorporation into
the DPP ligand as shown in Scheme 3.

12 reacts with 2 equiv of indole
to release THF and
2 equiv of SiMe4 and affords the bis(indolide) complex 14, which was confirmed by X-ray crystallography (Figure 7). The NMR features
of this complex are broadened in comparison with 12 and 13. This broadness could be a consequence of the interaction
of the indolide substrates with the extended π-systems of the
anthracenyl substituents. In the solid state, this distorted square
pyramidal complex (τ5 = 0.07) displays an average
distance of 3.38 Å between the nitrogen atoms of the indolide
ligands and the plane of the anthracenyl substituents, consistent
with π–π interaction. The six-membered rings of
the indolide ligands are positioned away from the Y center and toward
the anthracenyl substituents, suggesting that formation of the π–π
interactions is favored in comparison with formation of less sterically
congested complexes. As in the structure of 12, 14 exhibits longer Y(1)–N(Py) distances (2.516 (2)
and 2.518 (2) Å) in comparison with a shorter Y(1)–N (2)
distance of 2.260 (2) Å. Similar Y(1)–N(Ind) distances
of 2.238 (3) an 2.245 (3) Å are observed.

displacement ellipsoids. Hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity. Selected
bond distances (Å) and angles (°): Y1-N1 2.518 (2); Y1-N2
2.260 (2); Y1-N3 2.516 (2); Y1-N4 2.245 (3); Y1-N5 2.238 (3); N1-Y1-N2

(10).

Reaction of 4 or 5 with ZrCl4 upon in situ ligand deprotonation
with KHMDS afforded complexes
with exceedingly low solubility, leading to poor reproducibility of
the syntheses; however, grow crystals are suitable for X-ray diffraction
of the six-coordinate complex zirconium trichloride complex 15 (Figure 8) from this route. This complex features two long Zr-Py distances
of 2.392 (1) and 2.368 (1) Å with a relatively short Zr-pyrrolide
distance of 2.148 (1) Å. The three Cl ligands are located at
similar distances from Zr (1), in a range of 2.4006 (4) to 2.4273
(6) Å. The chloride ligand trans to the pyrrolide donor is located
between the two anthracenyl ligand substituents with distances of
3.19 and 3.23 Å between the chloride and the planes of the anthracene
groups. These distances are within the sum of the van der Waals radii
(3.4 Å) and are consistent with halogen−π interactions.38

bond distances (Å) and angles (°): Zr1-N1 2.3685 (11); Zr1-N2

(4); Zr1-Cl3 2.4273 (4); N1-Zr1-N2 69.15 (4); N1-Zr1-N3 137.59 (4);
N2-Zr1-Cl1 89.69 (3); N2-Zr1-Cl2 179.24 (3); N2-Zr1-Cl3 89.61 (3).

Due to the low solubility of this and other targeted
chloride complexes
and difficulties with complex isolation, more soluble complexes were
targeted. Reaction of M(NMe2)4 (M = Ti, Zr,
Hf) precursors with the pyrrole proligands in toluene at room temperature
affords the corresponding tris(dimethylamido) complexes in good yields
(Scheme 4). All tris(dimethylamido)
complexes, as isolated, feature a single dimethylamido resonance with
equivalent pyridines and equivalent aromatic ligand substituents by 1H and 13C NMR, consistent with fast exchange between
free and bound pyridine groups on the NMR timescale at room temperature.
Upfield-shifted NMe2 resonances are also observed for the
complexes bearing anthracene substituents as compared with complexes
bearing mesityl substituents (ΔδNMe(Ti) = 0.38;
ΔδNMe(Zr) = 0.48; ΔδNMe(Hf) = 0.47) consistent with increased shielding by the more extended
anthracenyl π-system.

Scheme 4 Synthesis of Tris(dimethylamido) Ti,
Zr, and Hf Complexes
Crystals suitable
for X-ray diffraction could be grown for (DPPmes)Ti(NMe2)3 (16, Figure 9). This crystallizes
with two molecules in the asymmetric unit; however, both feature five-coordinate
Ti centers with distorted trigonal bipyramidal geometry (τ5 = 0.74 and 0.73), with a free pyridine group. Consistent
with other structures, both Ti centers are located closer to the pyrrolide
N as compared with the pyridine N (2.1070 (10) and 2.1054 (11) Å
vs 2.3658 (11) and 2.3792 (11) Å). The dissociated pyridine arm
is rotated away from the Ti center with Ti–N distances of 5.0
to 5.1 Å and an angle of 28o between the plane of
the unbound pyridine and the bound pyrrolide and pyridine. The Ti
centers are both located out of the plane of the bound pyrrolide and
pyridine donors by 0.87 Å. A similar metal geometry was observed
by X-ray crystallography by Bochmann and co-workers in their Zr tris(dimethylamido)
complex supported by the bis(imino)pyrrolide ligand.21a

Based on the crystallographically characterized complexes supported
by the aryl-substituted DPP ligands, coordination of small and/or
flat ligands to metal centers supported by these ancillary ligands
leads to the formation of interactions with the DPP mesityl and anthracenyl
substituents. Distances in the range of 3.3 to 3.6 Å are observed
between ligands and aryl substituents, within the sum of the van der
Waals radii. As demonstrated in the solid-state structure of 8, coordination of the larger (tetramethyldisilylazide) ligands
leads to significant distortion of the anthracenyl substituents away
from coplanarity. As a consequence of the large bite angle of the
DPP ligand, ready ligand activation can occur in the case of Y and,
with the Ti, Zr, and Hf tris(dimethylamido) complexes, exchange of
free and bound pyridine arms is rapid at room temperature, although
coordination to only two donors is favored in the solid-state structure
of 16. This may indicate that the use of these arene-substituted
DPP ligands with larger metals could lead to compounds more competent
for intermolecular substrate activation by disfavoring pyridine dissociation.
From the solid-state structure of 14, interaction of
substrates bearing extended aromatic substituents with the flanking
anthracene substituents is favored; however, competition with formation
of lower coordinate number species and facile ligand activation limits
applicability in the current series of complexes.

The tris(dimethylamido)
complexes 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20 were evaluated
for their activity in the homopolymerization and in the copolymerization
of ethylene and 1-hexene. In initial small-scale reactions with 18, no activity was observed in toluene using MMAO-12 and
minimal activity was observed in chlorobenzene (Table S1, entries 1 and 2). The best activity from 18 was observed using a mixture of AlMe3 and [CPh3][B(C6F5)4] as an activator and
cocatalyst (740 g mmolM–1 h–1, Table S1, entry 3). Between the mesityl-
and anthracenyl-substituted Zr and Ti complexes under AlMe3/[CPh3][B(C6F5)4] activation
conditions, no activity differences were observed; however, the activity
did vary depending on the nature of the metal. In all cases, very
broad molecular weight distributions were observed, which is likely
a consequence of processes including chain transfer to aluminum, multiple
di(pyridyl) pyrrolide binding modes (Figure 10), and different degrees of dimethylamido
group substitution. The lack of effect from the aryl substituents
could indicate that interaction between the 1-hexene and ethylene
monomers and the mesityl and anthracenyl substituents does not substantially
alter catalyst behavior; alternatively, this could indicate that these
groups are not positioned so as to interact with the incoming monomers
in the active catalyst(s). The differences in activity between the
Ti, Zr, and Hf complexes could be indicative of different species
being formed upon activation of these complexes (Figure 10); with the smaller Ti, a
lower coordination complex is formed due to single pyridine binding
resulting in a more active species that produces higher-molecular-weight
products, whereas with the larger metals, formation of less active
species is favored.

Conclusions
In summary, a series of early metal alkyl, amide,
indolide, and
acetylide complexes supported by mesityl- and anthracenyl-substituted
di(pyridyl)pyrrolide ligands were synthesized, and the effects of
the extended π-substituents on their NMR and structural features
were examined. As a consequence of the anthracenyl substituents, significantly
upfield-shifted NMR resonances are observed for the amide resonances
on Y, Ti, Zr, and Hf complexes. The anthracenyl substituents are observed
to have close contacts with indolide, THF, chloride, and tetramethyldisilylazide
substituents and long metal-pyridine distances where coordination
of both pyridine donors is favored. In the structurally characterized
tris(dimethylamido)titanium complex, however, dissociation of one
pyridine is observed in the solid state to accommodate a closer metal-pyridine
distance. The ethylene polymerization behavior of the tris(dimethylamido)
group IV complexes was tested, and Ti and Zr complexes were found
to be competent for ethylene polymerization when activated with AlMe3 and [CPh3][B(C6F5)4], although the resulting polymers displayed very broad molecular
weight distributions, which is proposed to result from both from chain
transfer to Al and the formation of multiple species under these activation
conditions.

Experimental Section
General Comments
All air- and water-sensitive
compounds
were manipulated under N2 using standard Schlenk or glovebox
techniques. Solvents for air- and moisture-sensitive reactions were
dried by the method of Grubbs.39 Trimethylsilylacetylene,
chlorobenzene, and 1-hexene
were stirred over CaH2 for upward of 72 h, vacuum transferred
or distilled, and run over activated alumina prior to use. 1,30 2-mesitylboronic acid,31a 9-anthracenylboronic acid,31b2,32 Zr(NMe2)4,40 Hf(NMe2)4,41 Y(CH2SiMe3)3(THF)2,42 and Y(N(SiMe2H)2)3(THF)243 were prepared according to literature
procedures. [CPh3][B(C6F5)4] was purchased from Strem and used without further purification.
Methylaluminoxane (10% in toluene), AlMe3, and AlEt3 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further
purification. Deuterated solvents were purchased from Cambridge Isotopes
Laboratories, Inc. CDCl3 was used without further purification;
C6D6 was distilled from purple Na/benzophenone
ketyl and stored over 4 Å molecular sieves prior to use. 1H and 13C spectra were recorded on Varian INOVA-400,
Bruker Cryoprobe 400, and Bruker 400 spectrometers. 1H
and 13C chemical shifts are reported relative to residual
solvent resonances. Elemental analysis was performed on a PerkinElmer
2400 CHNS/O analyzer, and samples were taken from representative batches
prepared in an N2-filled glovebox, unless otherwise noted.

Preparation of 3
A Schlenk flask was charged
with 2 (4.6167 g, 10.55 mmol) and THF (400 mL) and cooled
to −78 °C with a dry-ice/acetone bath. nBuLi (4.2 mL, 10.5 mmol) was added over the course of several minutes,
and then B(OMe)3 (3.5 mL, 31.4 mmol) was added in one portion
after 1 h. The reaction was allowed to come to room temperature over
8 h and then quenched by addition of 2 N HCl. Volatiles were removed
under reduced pressure, and the residue was taken up in DCM and washed
with water and brine, dried with MgSO4, filtered, and evaporated.
Purification by column chromatography with an initial eluent of 10%
EtOAC in hexanes allowed separation of the major impurities, and the
desired material was eluted with 10% MeOH in DCM to afford a mixture
of the dimethyl borate, methyl borate, and boronic acid, which was
used for the next Suzuki coupling without further purification (3.273
g, 7.603 mmol, 77%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3,

General Small-Scale
Polymerization Procedure
In the
glovebox, a Fisher-Porter bottle was charged with PhCl (7 mL), 1-hexene
(0 or 0.50 mL, 0 or 4.0 mmol, 0 or 1000 equiv), AlMe3 (0.08
mL, 0.8 mmol, 200 equiv), and [CPh3][B(C6F5)4] (2 mL of 33.3 mg in 6 mL PhCl stock solution,
3 equiv) and sealed. A syringe was charged with the desired precatalyst
(0.004 mmol in 1 mL PhCl, 1 equiv) and sealed. Both were brought out
of the glovebox, the Fisher-Porter bottle was charged with 40 PSI
ethylene, the precatalyst solution was injected, and the pressure
rapidly increased to 100 PSI. After the desired reaction time, ethylene
flow was stopped and pressure vented, and the reaction was quenched
by slow addition of 10% HCl in MeOH solution (v/v). Solids were triturated
in at least 50 mL of 10% HCl in MeOH for several hours, then collected
by filtration, washed with additional fresh 10% HCl in MeOH, and dried
under vacuum.

General Large-Scale Polymerization Procedure
Polymerizations
were carried out in a 500 mL Büchi glass autoclave using a
HiTech polymerization reactor system. The reactor vessel was heated
to 110 °C under high vacuum for several minutes and then purged
repeatedly with Ar and vacuum to remove air and moisture. Upon cooling
of the vessel under Ar to the desired reaction temperature (60 or
80 °C), the vessel was charged with MAO (7.5 mL, 1000 equiv)
and PhMe (100 mL) and presaturated with ethylene (5 bar) for 10 min.
For ethylene-1-hexene copolymerizations, the reaction was additionally
charged with 1-hexene (20 mL, 1600 equiv) prior to presaturation.
Upon presaturation, the precatalyst (0.01 mmol) in PhMe (10 mL) was
injected into the reactor. The reaction was stirred for 60 min at
5 bar ethylene pressure and 60 or 80 °C; ethylene consumption
was monitored by a mass flow controller (Brooks Instrument). After
the desired reaction time, ethylene flow was stopped and excess pressure
was vented. The polymerization was quenched by addition of 5% HCl
in MeOH (200 mL), and the resulting polymer was isolated by filtration,
washed with fresh methanol, and dried under high vacuum.

GPC Analysis
Gel permeation chromatographic (GPC) analysis
of polymers was performed at 160 °C (PL-GPC 220, Agilent Technologies)
equipped with two PLgel Olexis 300 × 7.5 mm columns. BHT (0.0125
wt %) was added to 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene to prevent polymer sample
degredation. Sample solutions of 2.5–3.0 mg/1.5 mL were prepared
at 140 °C, and 100 μL was injected into the GPC. Data was
analyzed using the Cirrus software package, and the GPC was calibrated
using polystyrene standards. The polystyrene calibration curve was
converted into the universal using the Mark–Houwink constants
of polystyrene (Κ = 0.000406 dL/g and α
= 0.725).44

DSC Analysis
Differential
scanning calorimetric (DSC)
analysis was performed using a DSC Q2000 (TA Instruments). The temperature
and heat flow of the instrument were calibrated with an indium standard.
Polymer samples were first equilibrated at 25 °C, followed by
heating to 200 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min under N2 flow (50 mL/min). The temperature was maintained at 200 °C
for 5 min, and then the samples were cooled to 25 °C at a rate
of 10 °C/min. The temperature was maintained at 25 °C for
5 min, and then samples were reheated to 200 °C at a rate of
10 °C/min. The melting temperature (TM) for each sample was determined from the second heating scan. The
percent crystallinity was calculated from ΔHf(J/g)/ΔH(J/g), where ΔHstd is the heat of fusion for a perfectly crystalline
polyethylene (290.0 J/g).45
