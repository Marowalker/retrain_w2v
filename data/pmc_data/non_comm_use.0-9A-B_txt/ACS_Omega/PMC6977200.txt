The
Sondheimer dialkyne reagent has previously been employed in
strain-promoted double-click cycloadditions with bis-azide peptides
to generate stapled peptide inhibitors of protein–protein interactions.
The substituted variants of the Sondheimer dialkyne can be used to
generate functionalized stapled peptide inhibitors with improved biological
properties; however, this remains a relatively underdeveloped field.
Herein, we report the synthesis of new substituted variants of Sondheimer
dialkyne and their application in the stapling of p53-based diazido
peptides to generate potent stapled peptide-based inhibitors of the
oncogenic p53-MDM2 interaction. The functionalized stapled peptide
formed from a meta-fluoro-substituted Sondheimer
dialkyne was found to be the most potent inhibitor. Furthermore, through
experimental studies and density functional theory calculations, we
investigated the impact of the substituent on the strain-promoted
double-click reactivity of Sondheimer dialkyne.

Introduction
Peptide
stapling offers a strategy to generate potent inhibitors
of protein–protein interactions (PPIs) by constraining short
linear peptides into their native alpha-helical conformation by forming
a covalent link between two of its amino acid side chains.1−6 Recently, a double strain-promoted peptide stapling approach was
developed by our group, utilizing a double strained Sondheimer dialkyne
reagent 1 (Figure 1a).7 Sondheimer dialkyne 1 contains two strained alkyne moieties which allow the linking
of the two azide containing side chains on the linear peptide in a
metal-free environment via a double strain-promoted click chemistry.8−10 This double strain-promoted stapling approach has been successfully
applied to the development of stapled peptide inhibitors of the oncogenic
p53-MDM2 PPI, a validated target for anticancer therapeutics.7 The p53 protein is a tumor-suppressing transcription
factor that binds to an E3 ubiquitin ligase protein MDM2 which inhibits
the transcriptional activity of p53 and is overexpressed in some cancers.11−13

of PPIs. (b) This work: synthesis of functionalized stapled peptides
for p53-MDM2 inhibition by application of substituted Sondheimer dialkynes
in double strain-promoted stapling of a p53-based diazido peptide.

One major general limitation of the double strain-promoted
stapling
approach is the lack of functional groups on Sondheimer dialkyne 1 and thus the resulting stapled peptides. It was envisaged
that the use of substituted Sondheimer dialkynes in the stapling process
would allow for the facile introduction of diverse additional functionalities
into stapled peptides, which could impart novel physical properties
and modify biological activities. To explore this concept, we targeted
the design and synthesis of stapled peptide inhibitors of the p53-MDM2
PPI which incorporated substituents on their aromatic ring systems
(Figure 1b).

Herein, we describe the synthesis of substituted variants of the
Sondheimer dialkyne and their application in the double strain-promoted
stapling of a p53 diazo peptide 2 to generate previously
unreported functionalized stapled peptide inhibitors of the p53-MDM2
PPI. Substitution was shown to impact significantly upon the biological
profile of the stapled peptides, with the pattern of substitution
also being of great importance in this regard. In this work, through
both experimental and computational studies, we also show how the
presence of a substituent on Sondheimer dialkyne influences its azide
reactivity in double strain-promoted click chemistry.

Results and Discussion
Substituted
Sondheimer Dialkyne Synthesis
Four different
substituted variants of the Sondheimer dialkyne bearing methoxy and
fluoro substituents at the meta and ortho-positions relative to the
alkyne moiety were targeted (11, 12, 13, and 14, Scheme 1a). Orita et al. had previously reported
the synthesis of the Sondheimer dialkyne from ortho-(phenylsulfonylmethyl)benzaldehyde via a dimerization then double-elimination
sequence.14,15 It was envisaged that this approach could
be modified to allow access to the target substituted Sondheimer dialkynes 11–14 from the corresponding substituted
benzyl sulfone aldehyde substrates 3, 4, 5, and 6 (Scheme 1a).

Scheme 1 (a) Synthesis of Benzyl Sulfone-Substituted Aldehyde
Substrates;
(b) Synthesis of Substituted Sondheimer Dialkynes
Substituted benzyl sulfone aldehyde substrates 3, 4, and 5 were readily accessed from commercially
available starting materials 15, 18, and 19 (Scheme 1b). Wohl–Ziegler bromination of meta-fluoro-substituted
ester 15 and subsequent treatment with benzenesulfinic
acid afforded sulfone ester 16. DIBAL-H reduction of 16 followed by Dess–Martin oxidation gave the desired meta-fluoro-substituted aldehyde 3. The ortho-fluoro and meta-methoxy substituted
sulfones 4 and 5 were synthesized by treating
arenes 18 and 19 to Wohl–Ziegler
bromination, followed by nucleophilic substitution with benzenesulfinic
acid sodium salt. Reduction of the resulting sulfone nitriles 20 and 21 gave the desired aldehydes 4 and 5. Sulfone 6 bearing a 3,4-dimethoxyphenylsulfonyl
group was synthesized by following the reported procedure.15

The sulfones 3–6 were subjected
to Wittig–Horner conditions in the presence of LiHMDS and diethyl
chlorophosphate to form the cyclized intermediates 7–10 (Scheme 1a).14 Subsequent treatment with LDA led
to the elimination of the phenylsulfonyl groups to afford the desired
substituted dialkynes 11–14 in low-to-moderate
yields. This method was unsuccessful in the preparation of heteroaromatic
(pyridine and furan) based variants of Sondheimer dialkyne (see Supporting Information 1.1).

Strain-Promoted
Double-Click Peptide Stapling
The substituted
dialkynes 11–14 were then applied
to the double strain-promoted stapling of the p53-based diazido peptide
PDI-E 2 (Ac-LTFXEYWAQLXS-NH2, X = Orn(N3))16,17 in an effort to generate functionalized stapled peptide inhibitors
of the p53-MDM2 PPI. Peptide 2 was chosen for stapling
as previous work within our group has shown that the stapled peptide
generated from PDI-E peptide and Sondheimer dialkyne 1 is a potent inhibitor of the p53-MDM2 interaction.7 Double strain-promoted stapling of peptide 1 with substituted dialkynes 11–14 proceeded successfully to deliver the corresponding functionalized
stapled peptides 22–25 in 22–39%
yield (Scheme 2).The
functionalized stapled peptides are drawn as a single isomer for simplicity.
These functionalized stapled peptides were then tested for their in
vitro binding affinity with MDM2 in a competitive fluorescence polarization
(FP)2,18 assay. The meta-fluoro
derivative 22 (17.3 ± 7.7 nM) and meta-methoxy derivative 24 (8.5 ± 1.9 nM)-functionalized
stapled peptides were found to be particularly potent binders of MDM2
(Table 1).

Next, the p53-MDM2 inhibitory activities of the functionalized
stapled peptides 22–25 in a p53 reporter
cell-based assay were evaluated.18 p53
reporter cells taken in a 96-well format were treated with purified
stapled peptides 22–25 in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Figure 2a). The meta-fluoro-functionalized
peptide 22 was found to be the most potent inhibitor.
Moreover, 23 and 24 were also found to exhibit
slight inhibitory activity. p53 activation values are reported as
fold activation over the activation value obtained when cells were
treated with 1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). This provides an indirect
comparative measure of the cellular p53 levels, where higher values
are indicative of increased cellular activity. We also performed an
in situ stapling assay where p53 reporter cells taken in a 96-well
format were treated with linear diazido peptide 2 and
substituted dialkynes 11–14 in DMEM.
This in situ stapling technique allowed the screening of the resultant
stapled peptides directly in the cellular medium and avoided the need
to perform separate stapling reactions and purifications with each
dialkyne variant. This assay also showed meta-fluoro-functionalized
peptide 22 (fold activation: 3.9 ± 0.7) to be the
most potent and twice as active than unsubstituted stapled peptide 26 (fold activation: 1.9 ± 0.1, Figure 2b). No p53 activation was observed with dialkynes 12, 13, and 14.

as fold activation over 1% DMSO.

Kinetic Analysis
To determine the effect of substitution
on the azide-reactivity of Sondheimer dialkyne 1, we
experimentally investigated the SPAAC reactivity of our substituted
Sondheimer dialkynes bearing substituents at ortho- and meta-positions
relative to the alkyne moiety (Figure 3). We studied the reaction kinetics of 11 and 12 by monitoring their consumption in a SPAAC with
benzyl azide in methanol using UV spectroscopy (see Supporting Information 1.4 for details). We also compared
the kinetic data of ortho- and meta-amine-substituted dialkynes 27–32, available from our previous studies (Figure 3, see Supporting Information 1.4 for details).19 The second-order
rate constants determined experimentally are depicted in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Experimentally determined
second-order rate constants (k, in M–1 s–1) of substituted
Sondheimer dialkynes in SPAAC with benzyl azide in MeOH at rt.

We observed that the presence of a substituent
at the ortho-position
led to a significant decrease in the rate of reaction of 1. A fluoro-substituent at the meta-position (11, 0.047
M–1 s–1) did not have any considerable
effect on the rate of reaction of 1. On the other hand,
a fluoro-substituent at the ortho-position (12, 0.004
M–1 s–1) resulted in about ten-fold
decrease in the rate of reaction compared to 11 and 1. Moreover, the presence of a larger dimethylamine substituent
ortho to the alkyne (30) led to a further decrease in
reactivity, making it essentially unreactive toward benzyl azide at
rt.19 Similarly, dialkynes bearing a charged
trimethylammonium substituent at the ortho-position (31 and 32) were also found to be unreactive.19 Overall, trimethylammonium-substituted dialkyne 29 was found to be the most reactive dialkyne exhibiting 3.6-fold
increase in reactivity over Sondheimer dialkyne 1.

X-ray Crystallographic and Computational Analysis
In
order to understand the observed contrast in reactivity between the
ortho and meta-substituted dialkynes, we successfully determined the
X-ray crystal structures of amine-substituted dialkynes 27, 28, 29, and 30 (Figure 4a). Previously, Bertozzi
and co-workers have demonstrated how alkyne bond angles in strained
cyclooctyne reagents can be used as a measure to predict their reactivity.20 Hence, we sought to determine how the presence
of different substituents at ortho and meta-position would affect
structural changes in our substituted Sondheimer dialkynes. Alkyne
bond angles measured experimentally via X-ray crystallography for 27–30 are depicted in parenthesis in Figure 4b. From the resulting
structural data obtained, we noted that the presence of a dimethylamine
substituent at either the ortho or meta-position (30 and 27) did not affect any significant structural change on Sondheimer
dialkyne 1 (Figure 4b). A charged trimethylammonium substituent (28) at the meta-position, however, did affect minor structural
changes on the dialkyne distorting the alkyne bond angles slightly,
reflecting an increased reactivity.

dialkynes. (a) X-ray
crystal structures of dialkynes 27, 28, 29, and 30. (b) Calculated bond angles and strain
energy values (X-ray crystallography data shown in parenthesis).

Concurrently, we also performed a computational
analysis to predict
the alkyne bond angles of our amine and fluoro substituted dialkynes 11, 12, 27–30 (Figure 4b). All
geometry optimizations were performed using Gaussian 0921 with the B3LYP density functional and the 6-31G(d)
basis set within the CPCM model for methanol as the solvent at standard
conditions (see Supporting Information 2 for full computational details).8,20,22,23 Single-point energies
were calculated using M06-2X,24 the polarized,
triple-ζ valence quality def2-TZVPP basis set of Weigend and
Ahlrichs,25 and an ultrafine integration
grid within the CPCM model (methanol). The Gibbs free energy values
were determined by the addition of the B3LYP thermal correction to
the M06-2X energies.26 This approach has
previously been shown to give reliable results when modeling organic
reactions.27,28 The computationally obtained
geometry optimized structures of the substituted dialkynes 27–30 corroborated with the X-ray crystal structures
(see Supporting Information 1.5 and 2.1.1 for details). Furthermore, these studies indicated that the presence
of a fluoro substituent at the ortho or meta-position (12 and 11) did not result in any significant structural
change on Sondheimer dialkyne 1 (Figure 4b). We also calculated the strain energies
for these substituted Sondheimer dialkynes in accordance with the
work previously reported by Orita and co-workers (Figure 4b, see Supporting Information 2.2 for details).15 We found that all of the substituted dialkynes show similar
values of strain energy.

Generally, we noted that the substitution
of Sondheimer dialkyne 1 did not result in any significant
structural change and
all substituted dialkynes demonstrated alkyne bond angles around 155°,
along with similar strain energy values. This suggested that alkyne
bond angle distortion and strain energy are not the sole factors determining
the reactivity of these substituted strained alkynes and that there
are other potential factors like steric and electronic effects playing
a role.

Therefore, to further investigate the effect of the
substituent
on the reactivity of our amine and fluoro-substituted Sondheimer dialkynes 11, 12, 27–30, we calculated their transition state barriers in a SPAAC with methyl
azide (Figure 4a).
Previously, Goddard and co-workers have computationally predicted
a decrease in reactivity for dibenzocyclooctynes over cyclooctynes
due to the resulting steric interference between the incoming azide
and hydrogen atom on the benzene ring ortho to the alkyne.29 A similar decrease in the reactivity in the
presence of an ortho-substituent has also been observed by Bertozzi
and co-workers with biarylazacyclooctynone (BARAC)-based alkynes.20

We started our investigations with Sondheimer
dialkyne 1 and calculated the transition states for both
first and second cycloaddition
with methyl azide in MeOH at rt. We chose methyl azide as it is less
conformationally flexible than benzyl azide, and calculations show
that it behaves similarly to benzyl azide in a SPAAC with 1.20 We found that the first cycloaddition
leading to the formation of the monoyne intermediate is the rate-determining
step because the second cycloaddition demonstrated a lower activation
energy barrier than the first (by 3.6 kcal/mol, see Supporting Information Figures S86 and S94 for details). This
is in accordance with the results obtained by Hosoya and co-workers
for the SPAAC of Sondheimer dialkyne 1 with methyl azide.8 Therefore, we calculated the transition states
and activation barriers of the first cycloaddition for all of our
substituted Sondheimer dialkynes (Figure 5a). Transition states were found for both anti- and syn-attack (see Supporting Information 2.1.3 for details) of methyl azide
on dialkynes, we denote here the one with the lower activation barrier
for rate comparison.

kcal/mol for cycloaddition of substituted Sondheimer dialkynes with
methyl azide in methanol. (b) Front view of the transition states
of cycloaddition with dialkynes 1, 12, and 30 depicting C–N bond lengths. (c) Side view of the
transition states depicting the angle of the azide approach during
cycloaddition with dialkynes 1, 12, and 30.

We found that substitution of
Sondheimer dialkyne with a fluoro
group at the meta-position 11 led to a small decrease
in the activation barrier (by 0.6 kcal/mol), whereas substitution
with dimethylamine at meta-position 27 led to a small
increase in the activation barrier (by 0.5 kcal/mol). However, substitution
with either a fluoro 12 or dimethylamine 30 at the ortho-position led to large increments in the activation
barrier (by 1.1 and 2.3 kcal/mol, respectively), thereby suggesting
a decreased SPAAC reactivity. This increase in the SPAAC activation
barrier of Sondheimer dialkyne in the presence of an ortho-substituent
was found to be more significant with the bulkier dimethylamine substituent 30 in comparison to fluoro 12. This was clearly
reflected in their relative SPAAC rates observed experimentally (Figure 3).

We further
analyzed the transition states of ortho-substituted
dialkynes 12 and 30 in order to explain
their observed inactivity (Figure 5b,c). This demonstrated that the presence of a bulkier
dimethylamine substituent in 30 leads to an increased
C–N bond distance (by 0.2 Å) on one side in the transition
state (Figure 5b).
This is consistent with the observation made by Bertozzi and co-workers
with ortho-substituted BARAC.20 The presence
of a relatively smaller fluoro substituent at the ortho-position in 12 similarly resulted in a small increase in the C–N
bond distance (by 0.1 Å). We also looked at the approach of the
methyl azide toward dialkynes 12 and 30,
and we noticed from the transition states (side-view) that as the
size of the ortho-substituent increases, the angle of attack (from
the plane of dialkyne) increases (Figure 5c). These observations confirm that the presence
of an ortho-substituent on Sondheimer dialkyne hinders the approach
of methyl azide during cycloaddition, and the larger the substituent
the more significant is the effect. Conversion of meta-dimethylamine-substituted dialkyne 27 to monocharged 28 led to a decrease in the cycloaddition barrier (by 0.8
kcal/mol), suggesting an increase in rate of reaction (Figure 6a). This was further decreased
(by 0.6 kcal/mol) on conversion to the bis-charged 29, suggesting a further increase in the reactivity. This was in accordance
with their relative rates of reaction observed experimentally.

of D/I analysis on SPAAC of methyl azide with substituted
Sondheimer dialkynes. (b) Table depicting calculated distortion energies
(ΔEdist⧧), interaction energies (ΔEint⧧), overall electronic energies of activation (ΔE⧧), and free energies of activation (ΔG⧧). ΔEdist⧧, ΔEint⧧, and ΔE⧧ denoted here are
calculated using the single-point energies obtained with M06-2X,24 the polarized, triple-ζ valence quality
def2-TZVPP basis set of Weigend and Ahlrichs,25 and an ultrafine integration grid within the CPCM model (methanol).

In order to further explain the relative reactivities
observed
with substituted Sondheimer dialkynes, we applied the distortion/interaction
(D/I) model developed by Ess and Houk co-workers to selected substrates.30,31 This model deconstructs the activation energy ΔEact⧧ into distortion energy ΔEdist⧧ and interaction energy
ΔEint⧧ (Figure 6a). Distortion energy is the energy needed to distort
the starting alkyne and azide to transform them into their preferred
transition-state geometries, whereas the interaction energy is the
energy released upon favorable orbital interactions between these
distorted reactants. This model has previously been applied to various
SPAAC reaction systems, and it has been generally observed that steric
effects induced by the presence of a substituent are reflected in
an increased distortion energy, whereas the interaction energy encompasses
the electronic effects introduced by the substituent.20,23,32 Hence, we used this model to
calculate the distortion (ΔEdist⧧) and interaction energies
(ΔEint⧧) for our reaction in order to investigate
the steric and electronic effects of different substituents on Sondheimer
dialkyne SPAAC reactivity.

The results from D/I analysis (Figure 6b) demonstrated that
the presence of an ortho-substituent
next to the alkyne has a significant effect on the distortion energy.
For instance, installation of an ortho-fluoro (12) caused an increase in the distortion energy ΔEdist⧧ (by 1.3 kcal/mol) and a slight increase in the interaction energy
ΔEint⧧ (by 0.4 kcal/mol), leading to an overall
increase in the activation energy ΔE⧧ (by 0.9 kcal/mol). The most significant effect was observed with
the bulkier dimethylamine substituent at the ortho-position (30), which led to a considerable increase in the distortion
energy ΔEdist⧧ (by 1.8 kcal/mol) and no change in
the interaction energy, leading to an even higher overall activation
barrier ΔE⧧ (by 1.8 kcal/mol).
This clearly reflects the steric hindrance offered to the SPAAC reaction
in the presence of an ortho-substituent which becomes more significant
in the presence of an even bulkier substituent, overall resulting
in an observed sluggish reactivity of these dialkynes. This is also
in accordance with the D/I analysis results shown previously with
BARAC in the presence of an ortho-fluoro/methyl substituent.20 On the other hand, installation of a substituent
at the meta-position of Sondheimer dialkyne (11 and 27) did not have a considerable effect on the D/I energetics.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have reported the synthesis
of substituted variants
of the Sondheimer dialkyne and their application in the double strain-promoted
stapling of a p53-based diazido peptide 2 to generate
four novel functionalized stapled peptide inhibitors of the oncogenic
p53-MDM2 PPI. Minor changes in the aromatic substitution pattern around
the aromatic rings of the stapled peptides were found to affect both
MDM2 binding affinity and p53 cellular activity. The fluoro-functionalized
stapled peptide 22 was found to be the most potent inhibitor
in a p53-reporter cell-based assay. Overall, this study demonstrates
that substituted Sondheimer dialkynes can be employed in double strain-promoted
stapling as a means to readily access functionally diverse stapled
peptides. In the future, this approach could conceivably be used to
develop potent functionalized stapled peptide inhibitors of other
therapeutically relevant PPIs. Reactivity investigations, through
experimental studies and density functional theory calculations, suggested
the involvement of steric and electronic effects induced by the substituent
in determining the reactivity of the substituted Sondheimer dialkyne.

Synthetic Procedures
Methyl 4-Fluoro-2-((phenylsulfonyl)methyl)benzoate 16
To a suspension of methyl 4-fluoro-2-methylbenzoate 15 (2.0 g, 11.89 mmol) in CCl4 (59 mL) at 80 °C
under N2 were added NBS (2.23 g, 12.49 mmol) and AIBN (0.19
g, 1.19 mmol), and then the resulting mixture was heated at 100 °C.
After stirring at this temperature for 6 h, the reaction mixture was
cooled to rt. The reaction mixture was diluted with saturated aqueous

in CCl4 (37.0 mL) at 80 °C under N2 were
added NBS (0.75 g, 4.20 mmol) and BPO (97.0 mg, 0.40 mmol), and then
the resulting mixture was heated at 100 °C. After stirring at
this temperature for 6 h, the reaction mixture was cooled to rt. After
workup with CH2Cl2/NH4Cl(aq), the
combined organic layers were dried over MgSO4 and evaporated
in vacuo. To the resulting crude product were added CaCO3 (4.0 g, 40.0 mmol), dimethoxyethane (13.3 mL), and H2O (13.3 mL). After the resulting mixture had been heated at 120 °C
overnight, it was cooled to rt, and the remaining CaCO3 was neutralized with dilute HCl (aq) solution. The reaction mixture
was diluted with water (12 mL) and extracted with CH2Cl2 (3 × 20 mL). The organic layers were combined, dried
(MgSO4), filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. To this crude
product were added MnO2 (3.48 g, 40.0 mmol) and CH2Cl2 (13.3 mL). After the resulting mixture was
heated to 50 °C overnight, it was cooled to rt and filtered,
and the filtrate was concentrated in vacuo. Purification via flash
column chromatography on silica gel (EtOAc/hexane = 1:1) gave 6 as a pale-yellow solid (0.64 g, 50%).

Peptide Synthesis Procedure
Peptide
synthesis was carried
out on solid-phase using an Fmoc-protecting group strategy on a CEM
Liberty Automated Microwave Peptide Synthesizer. Merck Rink Amide
MBHA resin LL (0.29–0.39 mmol/g) was used. Peptide couplings
were conducted with Fmoc-protected amino acids (5 equiv) in DMF, HATU,
or HBTU (5 equiv) in DMF as the coupling reagent, and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (10 equiv) in NMP as the
base. Double coupling was used for arginine for 15 min each without
microwave irradiation. Single coupling was used for all other amino
acids, with 25 W power at 75 °C over 15 min. Fmoc deprotection
was carried out using 20% piperidine in DMF, with 45 W power at 75
°C over 3 min. N-terminal capping was carried out manually by
treating the resin-bound peptide with acetic anhydride (10 equiv)
and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (10
equiv) in dichloromethane for 45 min. Cleavage was carried out with
a cocktail of 95% trifluoroacetic acid, 2.5% water, and 2.5% triisopropylsilane
for 2 h. The cleavage solution was then evaporated under a stream
of nitrogen and triturated with diethyl ether prior to purification
by preparative HPLC. Peptide yields were estimated based on absorbance
in the HPLC chromatograph at 220 nm. The concentration of peptides
in stock solutions was determined by amino acid analysis at the Peptide
Nucleic Acid Chemistry Facility at the Department of Biochemistry,
University of Cambridge.

General Strain-Promoted Double-Click Peptide
Stapling Procedure
A solution of diazido PDI-E peptide (1
equiv) and dialkyne (1.1
equiv) in 1:1 t-BuOH/H2O (1 mL/mg peptide)
was stirred at rt for 16 h. The reaction mixture was lyophilized and
purified by HPLC to give the stapled peptide.

Competitive Fluorescence
Polarization Assay
Competitive
fluorescence polarization (FP) assays were performed as previously
described2,7 in 384-well microplates (Corning) on a CLARIOstar
microplate reader (BMG labtech) using an excitation filter 540–20
nm, dichroic mirror LP 566 nm, and emission filter 590–20 nm.
All peptides were dissolved in DMSO as stock solutions. The stock
concentration of the TAMRA-labeled tracer (TAMRA-RFMDYWEGL-NH2) was determined based on the 5-TAMRA absorbance at 556 nm
(extinction coefficient ε = 89,000 M–1 cm–1) measured on a NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific),
and the concentrations of all peptides were determined by amino acid
analysis (Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge). Kd of the TAMRA-labeled tracer was obtained from
previously reported experiments.2 For the
competitive fluorescence polarization assay, the TAMRA-labeled tracer
(50 nM) was incubated with MDM2 (95 nM) in PBS buffer containing 0.05%
(v/v) Tween 20 at 25 °C for 1 h. The unlabeled peptides or positive
controls (nutlin) were diluted twofold serially in PBS buffer containing
0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 for a 16-point titration curve (20 μL per
well). To each well containing the unlabeled compound was added the
TAMRA-labeled tracer/MDM2 solution (20 μL), and the mixture
was incubated for 1 h at 25 °C before the measurement was taken.
Titrations were performed in triplicate. Data were fitted in GraphPad
Prism 5.0 using the equations as described previously.35

Cellular p53 Reporter Assay
The
basic assay was carried
out as previously described in the literature18,36 and is briefly described as follows. T22 cells stably transfected
with a p53-responsive β-galactosidase reporter,18 kindly provided by Prof. Sir David Lane, were grown in
DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells
were seeded for 24 h at 8000 cells per 100 μL well in a 96-well
black-walled clear flat-bottom polystyrene plate (Greiner #655090),
then treated with the peptide in triplicate for 18 h at 37 °C
in DMEM with 10% serum and a final DMSO concentration of 1%. The β-galactosidase
activity was quantified using a FluoReporter LacZ/Galactosidase Quantitation
kit (Invitrogen). Fluorescence measurements were read on a Tecan Infinite
200 Pro plate reader. The in situ stapling version of the assay was
identical to the basic assay conditions in all aspects, except that
the cells were treated with a pure unstapled PDI-E peptide (50 μM)
and substituted Sondheimer dialkynes (0.5 mM). Control cells were
treated with only substituted Sondheimer dialkynes (0.5 mM), only
unstapled PDI-E peptide (50 μM), or only 1% DMSO.

Kinetic Analysis
The rate measurement of substituted
Sondheimer dialkynes 1, 11, and 12 in a double strain-promoted click reaction was performed by monitoring
the absorbance of dialkynes in the presence of an excess amount of
benzyl azide.8,15 It has been demonstrated previously
with Sondheimer diyne 1 that the first cycloaddition
leading to the formation of monoyne intermediate is the rate-determining
step of the reaction.8 All UV measurements
were recorded using a Varian Cary 300 UV–visible spectrophotometer.
General procedure: to 1.5 mL 2 mM solution of substituted dialkyne
in MeOH taken in a quartz cuvette was added 1.5 mL of MeOH solution
of benzyl azide in 3 different concentrations (100, 200, and 400 mM;
final concentration at 50, 100, and 200 mM, respectively). The consumption
of dialkyne was monitored by UV spectroscopy at a wavelength that
is characteristic for the absorbance of dialkyne but almost no significant
absorption is observed for benzyl azide and products. The experiments
were repeated in duplicate for each concentration of azide. The observed
absorbance data at the characteristic wavelength were plotted versus
time and fitted to a first-order exponential decay curve. The pseudo-first
order rate constants (k0) were determined
by least-squares fitting of the data to the following exponential
equation (y = A × exp(−k0 × x) + y0) using Origin, where A and y0 are constants. The pseudo-first order rate
constants determined were plotted versus the concentration of azide
and fitted to a straight line by a linear regression method using
Microsoft Office Excel 16. The slope of the straight line indicates
the second-order rate constant (k) for the first
cycloaddition in a double strain-promoted click reaction of dialkyne
with benzyl azide, which is the rate-determining step of the reaction.

Computational Analysis
All quantum mechanical calculations
were performed with Gaussian 09 Rev D.01. All geometries were optimized
using the B3LYP density functional and the 6-31G(d) basis set within
the conductor-like polarisable continuum solvation model (CPCM)37,38 for methanol, using the default integration grid. Vibrational frequencies
were computed for all optimized structures to verify that they were
either minima (zero imaginary frequencies) or transition states (a
single imaginary frequency). Single-point energies E (M06-2X) were
calculated using M06-2X,24 the polarised,
triple-ζ valence quality def2-TZVPP basis set of Weigend and
Ahlrichs,25 and an ultrafine integration
grid within the CPCM model (methanol). The strain-promoted click reaction
of substituted Sondheimer dialkynes with methyl azide was modeled
at 298.15 K at 1 atm in methanol. Methyl azide was employed as it
is less conformationally flexible than benzyl azide, and the calculations
showed that it behaves similarly to benzyl azide in a SPAAC with Sondheimer
dialkyne.20 Transition states were calculated
for both anti- and syn-attack of
methyl azide on diynes. Previous computational studies with similar
methods provided results in accordance with the experiment.8,20,29 Computationally obtained structures
were illustrated with PyMOL. The Gibbs free energy values were determined
by addition of the B3LYP thermal correction to the M06-2X energies.26 This approach has previously been shown to give
reliable results when modeling organic reaction.27,28
