Crystal
violet (CV) and methylene blue (MB) dyes with silver (Ag) nanoparticles
(NPs) were
encapsulated into silicone to produce light-activated antimicrobial
surfaces. Optical microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
showed that CV and MB were diffused throughout the silicone samples
and that Ag NPs were successfully encapsulated by the swell–encapsulation–shrink
process. Antimicrobial tests on Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli showed that
CV/MB-encapsulated silicone samples have stronger photobactericidal
activity than CV or MB samples and the addition of Ag NPs significantly
enhanced the antimicrobial activity under white light. The number
of viable bacteria decreased below the detection limit (below <103 CFU) on the silicone-incorporating CV/MB/Ag NPs within 3
h for S. aureus and within 5 h for E. coli. In leaching tests over 216 h, the amount
of dye leaching from the samples was barely detectable (<0.02 ppm).
These surfaces have a potential for use in healthcare settings to
decrease hospital-associated infections.

Introduction
The incidence of hospital-associated
infections (HAIs) has been
noted as “unacceptably high” by the National Institute
for Health and Care Excellence. In the U.K., about 300 000
patients per year are treated for a HAI, such as surgical site infections
(15.7%), infections of the urinary tract (17.2%), and lower respiratory
tract or pneumonia infections (22.8%), at a cost of approximately
£1 billion to the NHS1−4 It is estimated that 1 of 16 patients who receive
treatment in an NHS hospital in the U.K. would get a HAI.2−4 Despite extensive
effort, little has been accomplished to reduce the prevalence of hospital
pathogens and hospitalized patients are still under risk due to the
prevalence of HAIs.2 The approximate cost
of HAIs to U.S. hospitals was approximately U.S. $45 billion for hospital
services related to inpatients and around 75 000 patients with
HAIs died in 2011 according to the report by The Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention.5

Most of
the patients, visitors, and staff in hospitals do not apply
the highest standards of personal hygiene, and almost 80% of nosocomial
infections are transferred through touches between hospital surfaces
and healthcare workers or patients or between healthcare workers and
patients.6−13 Surfaces act as a reservoir for contamination and involve door handles,
keyboards, taps, sterile packaging, telephones, bed rails, mops, walls,
ward fabric/plastics, medical equipment, counters, bedside tables,
sheets, surgical trays, and stethoscopes.6−13

Improvements in medicine and surgery rely on a wide range
of medical
devices of which the catheter is the most commonly used.14 Catheters are medical devices used in the transfer
of fluids from and to the body in addition to drug administration.
Flexible polymeric materials (e.g., polyurethane and silicone) are
used to manufacture catheters. The surface properties of catheters
are frequently rough and nonshedding meaning that they can be easily
colonized by bacteria.14,15 There is a growing body of literature
that recognizes the importance of medical device-related infections
in causing significant morbidity especially in the case of implanted
synthetic medical devices.16−18 Among medical devices, catheter-related
infections are a cause of a high proportion of HAI. Intravascular
and urinary catheters are two of the most common sources of hospital
bloodstream infections, which are due to their prevalent use in medical
care.19 The three most common sources of
catheter failure and dysfunction are formation of a biofilm that causes
the development of thrombus formation, a fibrin sheath, and infection.20 An antimicrobial catheter surface would considerably
decrease the infections.21

Incorporation
of photosensitizer dyes, including crystal violet
(CV), methylene blue (MB), and toluidine blue O, into a polymer provides
a method to develop photoactivatable bactericidal surfaces.22−24 Photosensitive dyes have been encapsulated into polymeric materials
using a simple “swell–encapsulation–shrink”
method and displayed antimicrobial activity against a variety of bacteria.
The swell–encapsulation–shrink approach involves immersing
the polymer in an organic solution of the photosensitizer that enables
swelling of the silicone polymer and allows the diffusion of the dye
molecules uniformly within the polymeric matrix. The polymer is subsequently
removed from the solution, the solvent evaporates with shrinkage of
the polymer to its original size leaving the photosensitizer dye encapsulated
in the polymer.25 Photoactivated antimicrobials
have the advantage such that it is unlikely that bacterial resistance
will develop to them because the bactericidal properties occur through
multiple pathways.26,27 Light-activated antimicrobial
agents, including molecular dyes, can destroy bacterial cells when
they are illuminated with light by generating reactive oxygen species
(ROS) and/or singlet oxygen. Despite the fact
that the photosensitive dyes are not toxic, during illumination with
visible light, the molecule is stimulated from ground singlet state
to an excited triplet state, creating cytotoxic ROS through photochemical
reaction type I and/or type II: through type I, the dye in the triplet
state interacts with the surrounding environment, resulting in production
of ROS, and through type II, the molecular energy in a triplet state
is transferred to triplet oxygen (3O2) and then
it produces singlet oxygen (1O2).28,29

Different kinds of metallic nanomaterials, such as copper,
zinc,
titanium, magnesium, gold, and silver, have been comprehensively studied
with regard to their toxicity and bactericidal properties. So far,
silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) have demonstrated the most effective
bactericidal activity against microorganism.22,30 Ag NPs are used in a range of applications, e.g., burn treatment,
dental materials, coating stainless steel materials, textile fabrics,
and water treatment. Additionally, Ag NPs showed low volatility, high
thermal stability, and low toxicity for human cells.22,30,31

In this study, we combine
CV and MB into silicones together with
Ag NPs by the swell–encapsulation–shrink process and
the materials were tested for antimicrobial activity under white light
and dark conditions. Optical microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) showed that the dyes and Ag NPs are well encapsulated into the
silicone, and leaching tests confirmed that the materials are stable
in water over a long period of time. In antimicrobial tests, the materials
showed very potent bactericidal activity under white light and also
showed antimicrobial activity in the dark. This is the first time
that two photosensitizer dyes have been used in combination with Ag
NPs.

Results and Discussion
Silver nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized
by mixing and heating
aqueous solutions of sodium borohydride and trisodium citrate (TSC),
followed by the dropwise addition of silver nitrate to the heated
mixture of reductants. The solution was further heated until the formation
of a bright yellow color. As shown in Figure 1A, high-resolution transmission electron
microscopy (HR-TEM) analysis showed that the nanoparticles are spherical
and polydispersed and the average nanoparticle size of Ag NPs was
6.8 ± 4.5 nm in diameter (Figure 1B). Energy-dispersive spectrometry analysis confirmed
the existence of Ag NPs without impurities. The absorption spectra
of Ag NPs solution showed a peak at 398 nm (Figure 1C), and the concentration of Ag in the particle
solution was about 36 ppm.

distribution, and
(C) absorption spectra of Ag NP solution.

A facile swell–encapsulation–shrink method
was used
to encapsulate Ag NPs into medical-grade silicone. CV/MB/Ag NPs encapsulated
into silicones were prepared using a two-step dipping process. Silicone
samples (10 mm × 10 mm × 1 mm) with various dipping times
were analyzed using optical microscopy. The thinly sliced silicone
side sections were imaged using charge-coupled device camera to confirm
dye diffusion into the inside of the silicone. At the beginning, absorption
was predominately near to the silicone surface and with increasing
exposure time, the dye absorbed throughout the silicone (Figure S1). As shown in Figure 2, the coloration of samples is dark blue
for silicone-incorporating Ag NPs and MB, dark purple for silicone-containing
Ag NPs and CV, and dark blue-purple for silicone-incorporating MB,
CV, and Ag NPs. Ag NP-encapsulated silicone had a more intense color
than silicone without Ag NPs, indicating that the addition of Ag NPs
enables enhanced dye uptake into the silicone. As a result, the main
absorbance spectra of the NP-encapsulated samples were higher than
the sample without the NPs.

Figure 2 Distribution of dye in silicone after swell-encapsulation-shrink
process for 24 or 72 h in silicone.

As shown in Figure 3, UV–vis absorbance spectroscopy measurements of silicone
samples incorporating Ag NPs and dye showed greater absorbance signals
compared to those only incorporating Ag NPs or dyes. The silicone-incorporating
MB or CV absorbed intensely with maxima at 650 and 590 nm, respectively.
The silicone encapsulated with the two dyes and the Ag NPs demonstrated
absorption peaks at 650 and 600 nm, corresponding to MB and CV, respectively.
The presence of Ag nanoparticles (vide infra from XPS) in the silicone
increased the dye peak intensity, whereas the peak shape and position
stayed the same compared to silicone-incorporating dyes alone. However,
the combination of Ag NPs, CV, and MB displayed a small shift in the
peak maxima position from 590 to 600 nm. It might be because Ag NPs
had an interaction with the dyes.32 Additionally,
as shown in Figure S2, the characteristic
UV–vis signal of the nanoparticles was not observed when Ag
NPs only were embedded into silicone. It was considered that the number
of Ag NPs inside the polymer was not enough to be easily detected
by the spectrometer or that the signal of Ag NPs was covered by the
absorbance spectrum of the polymer because allowing for polymer thickness
absorbance at 389 nm was higher than that of Ag NPs suspension for
encapsulation.

and (c)
CV, CV-Ag NPs.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) was used to analyze the
existence of Ag NPs on the polymer surface and within the polymer
bulk for Ag NP-encapsulated silicone samples. As shown in Figure 4, XPS analysis of
the Ag NP-encapsulated silicone sample showed an indication of silver,
identifying the existence of Ag NPs embedded both within the polymer
matrix and at the polymer surface. As shown in the figure, XPS shows
evidence of Ag NPs at the sample surfaces and within the polymer bulk.
A doublet peak in the Ag (3d) region corresponds to silver 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 that consist of two peaks 368.3 and
373.3 eV binding energies, respectively, showing evidence of Ag on
the surface and within the silicone bulk. XPS depth profile data results
indicate the presence of Ag NPs encapsulated on the surface and within
the polymer matrix. To investigate the concentration of Ag NPs encapsulated
into the polymer, the UV–vis spectra of Ag NPs suspension were
measured before and after encapsulation. The silicone sample was placed
into Ag NPs suspension for 24 h. Ag (1.5 ppm) in the suspension was
encapsulated into the polymer after 24 h indicating that 41% of Ag
NPs was encapsulated.

regions
of the polymer.

In previous research,
it was reported that swell–encapsulation–shrink
process decreased significantly the water contact angle of polyurethane
resulting in a change from hydrophobic and hydrophilic.24 However, as shown in Table 1, when the nanoparticles and dyes were encapsulated
into silicone, the change in water contact angle of silicone was minor,
indicating that the process does not affect its hydrophobicity.

The extent to which CV and MB were released from the
silicone-incorporating
dyes was measured using a UV–vis spectrometer. The treated
samples with dye were immersed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
solution up to a period of 216 h. Figure S3 shows the concentrations of MB and CV dyes released from the treated
sample. The total concentration of the dye leached from silicone was
below 0.02 ppm over a period of 200 h. The results confirmed that
the leakage of CV and MB into the surrounding PBS solution is negligible.

The bactericidal activities of treated and control samples were
examined against Escherichia coli,
Gram-negative bacterium, and Staphylococcus aureus, Gram-positive bacterium. The visible light source that was used
to initiate bactericidal activity was less intense than most of those
used in U.K. hospital environments (3000 lx).26,33 The light-activated bactericidal activities of the following samples
were determined: solvent-treated silicone (control), MB- or CV-only
encapsulated silicone (MB or CV), Ag NP-only encapsulated silicone
(Ag), Ag NPs and MB encapsulated into silicone (MB-Ag), Ag NP- and
CV-encapsulated silicone (CV-Ag), MB- and CV-encapsulated silicone
without Ag NPs (CVMB), and MB- and CV-encapsulated silicone with Ag
NPs (CVMB-Ag).

The capacity of the materials to cause photoactivatable
killing
of bacteria was determined using a white light source with an average
light intensity of 970 ± 80 lx. The light intensity distribution
ranged from high to low between 800 and 1100 lx from the center toward
the edge (Figure S4). As shown in Figure 5A, Ag MB, MB-Ag,
and CV demonstrated no significant kill of S. aureus by comparison with the control silicone sample in dark conditions
after incubation for 3 h. However, CV-Ag, CVMB, and CVMB-Ag silicone
samples caused a statistically significant (p value
<0.05 compared to the control) reduction in the number of S. aureus compared to that of the control silicone
sample in the dark for the same period of time; 0.47 log, 0.32 log,
and 0.35 log kills were on CV-Ag, CVMB, and CVMB-Ag samples,
respectively. After 3 h incubation in white light, photosensitizer
dye-encapsulated samples showed photoactivated bactericidal activity.
Among them, MB-Ag, CV-Ag, CVMB, and CVMB-Ag samples showed potent
photobactericidal activity. The MB-Ag, CV-Ag, and CVMB samples had
0.74 log, 0.61 log, and 0.47 log kills (p value <0.05 compared to the control). The CVMB-Ag sample
demonstrated the most lethal photosensitization, with the number of
bacteria reduced below the detection limit within 3 h of incubation
(>2.55 log reduction and p value <0.01
compared to the control).

Figure 5 Antimicrobial activity of treated silicone samples
on (A) S. aureus and (B) E. coli under dark condition and white light conditions.
In all tests, the
temperature was maintained at a constant 20 °C.

As shown in Figure 5B, the antimicrobial activity of the light-activated
bactericidal
surfaces was observed against E. coli after 5 h incubation time. Compared with the control, the CV-Ag
and CVMB-Ag samples showed statistically significant reduction in
the number of bacteria (p value <0.01 compared
to the control) after 5 h incubation in the dark, whereas the antimicrobial
activity of Ag, MB, CV, MB-Ag, and CVMB sample was negligible. The
CV-Ag and CVMB-Ag silicone samples showed strong bactericidal activities
with 0.48 log and 2.1 log reductions in the dark, respectively
(p value <0.01 compared to the control). Upon
5 h exposure of white light, MB-Ag, CV, CV-Ag, CVMB, and CVMB-Ag samples
showed an enhanced bactericidal activity (p value
<0.01 compared to the control). The MB-Ag- and CV-only encapsulated
samples demonstrated 0.44 log and 0.73 log kills upon
5 h white light illumination, and the CV-Ag and CVMB samples also
showed an enhanced activity with 1.6 log and 1.21 log
reductions, respectively. The dual-dye-encapsulated sample with silver
nanoparticles (CVMB-Ag) showed the most potent bactericidal activity
upon 5 h of white light illumination with bacterial numbers reduction
below the detection limit (>3 log and p value
<0.01 compared to the control).

This study shows that potent
lethal photoactivated silicone has
the capacity to cause killing of S. aureus, after shorter illumination time than E. coli. The results from our work have shown that the inactivation of bacteria
is associated with the type of bacterium. The susceptibility of E. coli, Gram-negative bacterium, is less than S. aureus, Gram-positive bacterium, relating to different
cell walls that respond differently to the radical threat.34

It is known that Ag NPs, crystal violet,
and methylene blue have
intrinsic bactericidal activity. Ag ions or the dyes themselves dissociated
from the substances cause bacterial death.35,36 However, after encapsulation, each of them did not represent any
bactericidal activity in the dark, thus indicating that the cytotoxic
effect of Ag or the dyes was not sufficient to reduce bacterial viability.
The combination of Ag NPs and crystal violet or crystal violet and
methylene blue in the polymer produced a reduction in the number of
viable bacteria in dark. This might be because of multitype ion attack
produced from silver and the dyes. This trend was in agreement with
previous research.24 Additionally, MB-Ag
sample did not show an enhanced bactericidal activity in dark and
this is mainly due to methylene blue, which has a weak bactericidal
activity compared to crystal violet.37

On exposure to the white light, crystal violet or methylene blue
molecules are promoted from a ground state to an excited single state
and then they transform to a triplet state via intercrossing system
or they return to a ground state through energy loss depending on
surrounding or dye molecules conditions.28,29 The molecules in a triplet state undergo two different pathways
including photoreaction types I and II. In photoreaction type I, they
produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) through an interaction with
their environment, and in the reaction II, the energy is transferred
to triplet oxygen species resulting in single oxygen (1O2) generation. Bacteria in the vicinity of the sample
surface are killed by multisite attack of the generated ROS and 1O2.28,29 In previous studies, it was reported
that Au or Ag nanoparticle addition into the dyes did not increase 1O2 generation under white light condition, indicating
that photoreaction type II is not enhanced by the particles.24,38 Thus, it is speculated that the addition of silver nanoparticles
into dye-impregnated silicone enhances photoreaction type I, resulting
in an enhanced photobactericidal activity with an increase of ROS
generation

Although MB is distributed comparatively uniformly
throughout the
polymer, CV-encapsulated polymer exhibits high concentrations in a
layer on the polymer surface, as analyzed using optical microscopy.
This mechanism can clarify the difference between MB- and CV-encapsulated
silicones because the dye on the surface would cause enhanced generation
of ROS that results in exceptional kill of surface-located bacteria.

The ROS diffusion distance generated during photosensitization
of a dye is probably between 10 and 100 nm within the polymer, and
the half-life time of ROS is less than 1 μs in physiological
environment.39 Because of this short diffusion
distance of ROS within a polymer, the photosensitizer encapsulated
within the polymer bulk is redundant in terms of bactericidal activity.
Thus, the photobactericidal activity was mainly induced by the dyes
near to the sample surface.

To validate the bactericidal efficacy
of the Ag NP-encapsulated
surface, photobactericidal activity was compared to results in previous
studies.33,40,41 The study
of Ag NP-coated titania thin film showed that Ag NPs could enhance
photobactericidal effect against E. coli under a white light intensity of 5000 lx.33 The combination of Ag NPs, CV, and MB dyes produced stronger photobactericidal
activities against E. coli and S. aureus than those of Ag NPs and titania because
with a white light intensity of average 970 lx, our combination reduced
bacterial viability to below detection limit within 3 h (S. aureus) or 5 h (E. coli). Compared to multidyed photobactericidal surface40 and zinc oxide NP-encapsulated polymer,41 Ag NP-encapsulated surface dropped the required light intensity
to obtain bacterial kill by a quarter.

The bactericidal activity
of these novel dual dyes and silver-encapsulated
surfaces would be the most effective in places that have higher light
intensity, for instance, operating theaters and examination rooms.34 It was shown in this study that although relatively
low light intensity was used for short exposure times, exceptional
bacteria kill can still be achieved. However, it should be considered
that very high bacterial load (∼1.3 × 106 CFU
cm–2 for E. coli and
∼2.2 × 106 CFU cm–2 for S. aureus) was used to observe the efficiency of
antimicrobial activity of the polymer in these experiments. In comparison
to hospital surfaces, the contaminated surfaces reserve notably less
than the level used in these experiments (up to an equivalent of 3060
CFU cm–2 with average values of <100 CFU cm–2).40

In previous
studies, the photostability test was performed under
a white light lamp with a light intensity of 12 500 lx for
29 days, and it was shown that dual-dye- and Au nanoparticle-encapsulated
polymer maintained its absorbance spectra over a long period of time.40 The light intensity of the lamp used in this
study was about 13 times lower than 12 500 lx. Thus, it is
speculated that under our white light condition, the photobactericidal
polymers will maintain their activity for far longer than 29 days
and of the order of a year.

Conclusions
Through a swell–encapsulation–shrink
process, methylene
blue, crystal violet, and silver nanoparticles were encapsulated into
medical-grade silicone that is in common use in healthcare environments.
XPS and optical microscopy demonstrated that the dyes and silver nanoparticles
were successfully penetrated inside the polymer, and UV–vis
spectroscopy showed that the addition of silver nanoparticles enhanced
the absorbance features of either dyes crystal violet and methylene
blue. In leaching test, the dyes in the polymer were shown to be stable
over a period of 210 h with minor leaching into the surrounding liquid.
Bactericidal test showed that when silver nanoparticles and dual-dye-encapsulated
samples were exposed to white light, their bactericidal activity was
significantly enhanced, achieving >3 log reduction of viable bacteria
after several hours exposure of white light (3 h for S. aureus and 5 h for E. coli). It is expected that the photobactericidal surfaces that we developed
is useful to reduce surface contamination by bacteria and thus the
nosocomial infection in hospital facilities.

Experimental Section
Chemical
and Reagents
AgNO3 (silver nitrate),
Na3C6H5O7·2H2O (sodium citrate tribasic dehydrate), and acetone were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. Sodium borohyride (NaBH4) was purchased from BDH Chemicals Ltd. Medical-grade flat silicone
sheets (thickness 1.0 mm) were purchased from NuSil (Polymer Systems
Technology, Ltd.). Deionized (DI) water (resistivity 15 MΩ cm)
was used during the experiments.

Synthesis of Silver Nanoparticles
Silver nanoparticles
were prepared using sodium borohydride (NaBH4) and trisodium
citrate (TSC),42 as primary and secondary
reductants, respectively, in addition to a stabilizing agent. The
reduction processes were performed at 60 and 90 °C and provided
mainly through sodium borohydride and trisodium citrate, respectively.
A usual preparation is as follows: the required volumes of freshly
prepared aqueous solutions of NaBH4 (2 × 10–3 M) and TSC (4.25 × 10–3 M) were mixed and
heated to 60 °C under vigorous stirring for 30 min to make a
homogenous solution. After 30 min, 4 mL of AgNO3 solution
(1 × 10–3 M) was added dropwise to the mixture
solution and then the temperature was further raised to 90 °C.
The temperature was maintained at 90 °C for 20 min until a bright
yellow color was obtained. The nanoparticle suspension was then allowed
to cool to room temperature.

Preparation of Visible Light-Activated Antimicrobial
Polymers
Preparation of MB only and MB with Ag NPs samples:
as shown in Figure S5A,D, methylene blue
(MB) solutions were
prepared at a concentration of 700 ppm in a mixture of acetone (9
mL) and DI water (1 mL) or NPs (1 mL). Silicone samples (10 mm ×
10 mm × 1 mm) were immersed in 10 mL of the solutions and kept
in the dark for 24 h. The silicone samples were collected from the
solutions and washed two times using DI water and then air-dried for
24 h in the dark at room temperature.

Preparation of CV-only
samples: as shown in Figure S5B, crystal
violet (CV) solutions were prepared at a concentration of 1000 ppm
in DI water. Silicone samples were placed in 10 mL of the solutions
and kept in the dark for 72 h, the samples were then collected from
the solution, washed two times using DI water, and then air-dried
for 24 h in the dark at room temperature.

Preparation of Ag
NP-encapsulated samples: as shown in Figure S5C, the samples were placed in a mixture
of acetone (9 mL) and Ag NPs (1 mL) for 24 h, then collected from
the solution, washed two times using DI water, and air-dried for 24
h in the dark at room temperature.

Preparation of CV samples
with Ag NPs: as shown in Figure S5F, the
samples were immersed in a mixture
of acetone (9 mL) and Ag NPs (1 mL) for 24 h and then immersed in
CV solutions for 72 h. The samples were collected from the solution,
washed two times by DI water, and then air-dried for 24 h in the dark
at room temperature.

Preparation of CVMB samples: as shown in Figure S5E, the samples were immersed in MB solutions for 24 h and
then placed in CV solution for 72 h. The samples were collected from
the solution, washed two times using DI water, and then air-dried
for 24 h in the dark at room temperature.

Preparation of CVMB
samples with Ag NPs: as shown in Figure S5G, the samples were immersed in the
mixture of Ag NPs and MB for 24 h and then placed in CV solution for
72 h. They were collected from the solution, washed two times using
DI water, and then air-dried for 24 h in the dark at room temperature.

Materials Characterization
Ag NPs suspension was drop-casted
onto a 300 Cu mesh lacey carbon film grid (Agar Scientific Ltd.) and
then air-dried for 1 h. The images of nanoparticles were taken by
a JEOL 2100 high-resolution transmission electron microscope equipped
with an energy-dispersive X-ray. The imageJ was used to analyze TEM
images.

The UV–vis absorption spectra of Ag NPs suspensions,
control, and treated silicone samples were measured by a UV–vis
spectrometer Lamb 25 (PerkinElmer Inc., Winter St., CT). Absorption
was measured from 400 to 800 nm for treated silicone samples and 300–800
nm wavelength for Ag NPs solution.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) was performed by a Thermo
K-Alpha spectrometer to determine silver as a function of polymer
depth. All binding energies were calibrated to the C 1s peak at 284.5
eV.

FTA 1000 drop shape instrument was used to determine the
difference
in surface hydrophobicity before and after the treatment on the silicone,
and the water contact angle (∼5.0 μL) was analyzed by
the FTA32 software.43

The stability
of the dye-encapsulated silicone was tested in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) at room temperature. All treated samples encapsulated
with dye were immersed in PBS for an extended period of time. The
UV–vis spectra of absorbance of PBS solution were measured
periodically (596 nm, Pharmacia Biotech Ultrospec 2000) to determine
leaching amount of the dye from the treated silicone into the surrounding
solution. The concentration of MB and CV that was released into the
PBS solution was examined by comparison of the absorbance of PBS at
665 and 584 nm with a MB and CV calibration curve.

Uptake of Ag
NPs into Silicone
To investigate the concentration
of Ag NPs encapsulated into silicone, the silicone was placed in a
mixture of acetone (9 mL) and Ag NPs (1 mL) for 24 h. The UV–vis
absorbance spectra of Au NPs suspension were measured before and after
the encapsulation. Through the change of absorption at 398 nm, the
concentration of Ag NPs inside silicone can be determined.

The
amount of the NPs encapsulated into the polymer was calculated as
follows 1  where AUbefore indicates the absorption
of NP suspension before the encapsulation and AUafter represents
the absorption of NPs suspension after the treatment; 3.6 ppm indicates
Ag concentration in the suspension.

Antimicrobial Test
The antimicrobial activities of
the samples were tested against E. coli (strain ATCC 25922) and S. aureus 8324-5, both of which were stored at −70 °C in brain-heart-infusion
(BHI) broth (Oxoid Ltd., Hampshire, England, U.K.) containing 20%
(v/v) glycerol and propagated on either MacConkey agar or mannitol
salt agar (Oxoid Ltd., Hampshire, England, U.K.) for E. coli and S. aureus, respectively. BHI broth (10 mL) was inoculated with one bacterial
colony and cultured at 37 °C for 18 h with a shaking of 200 rpm.
After 18 h, the bacteria were harvested through centrifugation (20
°C, 3000g, 15 min), washed using 10 mL of PBS
two times, and then 1000-fold diluted to obtain bacterial suspension
with 106 CFU mL–1. Bacterial suspension
(25 μL) was inoculated onto the surface of the treated silicone
sample. The samples were placed into plastic Petri dishes containing
moistened filter paper to maintain humidity and exposed to a white
light intensity of 970 lx, while an identical set of samples was maintained
in the dark. After light exposure, the modified sample was placed
into 5 mL of PBS and vortexed for 1 min to wash out bacteria from
the sample to PBS. The bacterial suspension was serially diluted,
plated onto MacConkey agar or mannitol salt agar, and cultured at
37 °C for 24 h (E. coli) and 48
h (S. aureus), respectively. The colonies
that were grown on the plates were counted.

Statistical Analysis
Statistic t test
of the results was performed using Excel (Microsoft Corporation).
