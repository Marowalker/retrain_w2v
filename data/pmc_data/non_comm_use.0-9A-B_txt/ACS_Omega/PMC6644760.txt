Energy harvesting from thermal energy
has been widely exploited
to achieve energy savings and clean technologies. In this research,
a new cost-effective and environment-friendly solution is proposed
for the growing individual energy needs thanks to the energy application
of cavitating flows. With the aid of cavitating jet flows from microchannel
configurations of different sizes, it is shown that significant temperature
rise (as high as 5.7 °C) can be obtained on the surface of the
thin plate. The obtained heat energy could be integrated to a thermoelectric
power generator, which can be used as a power resource for consumer
devices, such as cell phones and laptops. To explore the difference
in the temperature rise with different microtube diameters, namely,
152, 256, 504, and 762 μm, and also with different upstream
pressures of 10, 20, 40, and 60 bar, the cavitation flow patterns
are captured and analyzed using an advanced high-speed visualization
system. The analysis of the captured data showed that different flow
patterns exist for different diameters of the microtubes, including
a pattern shift from micro- to macroscale, which accompanied the pattern
of temporal results very well.

Introduction
Hydrodynamic cavitation
is a progressive cycle of vaporization,
bubble generation, and bubble implosion and is one of the major phase
change phenomena. The effects of hydrodynamic cavitation have been
examined by many researchers and are included in the literature.1−5 It occurs when the local static pressure is reduced to a critical
value. Small bubbles are generated in small flow-restrictive elements,
which trigger a sudden reduction in the local pressure of the flows
and cause cavitation inception. The collapse of the cavitation bubbles
downstream of these elements leads to a high energy release, thereby
generating highly localized, large-amplitude shock waves and high-velocity
jets.6,7 Thus, hot spots of over 1000 K and high-speed
microjets exceeding 300 m/s have been achieved as a result of the
collapse of the cavitation bubbles.8,9 Although jet
impingement gives rise to cooling on an exposed surface and is considered
an effective cooling method,10−12 a rise in the surface temperature
can be instead attained in the presence of intense bubbly cavitating
flows downstream of the flow-restrictive elements. Our recent study
illustrates that many cavitation bubbles were generated in channels
with inner diameters of 256 and 504 μm and filled more space
inside the channel compared to the conventional channels at higher
upstream pressures,13 which increased the
possibility of the occurrence of collapse process at the outlet of
the microchannels. These findings imply that the proposed method in
this study is feasible. Multiple cavitation bubbles in the proximity
of a surface constitute a heat source with uniform temperature distribution,
which can be integrated to a thermoelectric generator to power daily-used
devices. This effect constitutes the motivation of the present study.

Small bubbles have many potential applications in the pharmaceutical,
food, and chemical industries. In the field of medicine, nano-/microbubbles
are expected to be applicable in areas such as the development of
ultrasound contrast agents,14 targeted
drug delivery, tumor destruction, and tumor imaging.15 In the food industry, the density and texture of gel- and
cream-based foods could be controlled by the uniform and fine dispersion
of gases into these materials.16

Two types of studies were considered in the literature on the field
of the proposed system. On the one hand, spraying is used as a technology
to provide cooling heat transfer on the exposed targets. In this regard,
due to the high heat flux removal, high heat dissipation rate, and
low superheat, spray cooling has been used in different areas of industry.17

On the other hand, utilization of the
thermal gradient generated
during the collapse of the ultrasound cavitation bubble is considered
in a broad range in the literature. The gas inside the bubble has
high temperature and pressure during the collapse point.18 Moreover, the cavitation impact of the power
loss and heat dissipation due to the bubble generation and noise generation
in the hydraulic machinery has been considered in the literature recently.19 It was predicted that the cavitation phenomenon
would have a strong potential for heat generation from an energetic
point of view.

In this study, compared to the studies available
in the literature,
we propose a novel approach in microscale utilizing the energy produced
during the interaction of the spray affected by the hydrodynamic cavitating
flow and a thin aluminum plate. With a decrease in size, cavitation
effects become significant. It is clearly shown that with the aid
of hydrodynamic cavitation generated inside the micro-/minichannels
in addition to the optimization of the distance between the tip of
the microchannel configuration and the solid surface, surface temperatures
can be increased up to 5 °C under the conditions of this study.
The temperature rise on the surfaces near the collapsing small bubbles
was exploited for energy harvesting in small scale in such a way that
miniature, cost-effective, and environment-friendly energy-harvesting
devices can be developed. Such devices will not require any external
power and moving parts in contrast to common energy-harvesting devices,
such as those involving piezoelectric materials20,21 and microengines.22,23 In this study, the capability
of the hydrodynamic cavitation in microscale as a strong alternative
to the ultrasound cavitation is presented in terms of clean and cheap
energy harvesting, which has not been considered in the literature
to the best of our knowledge.

Results and Discussion
The results
show a temperature rise in all of the cases. In Figure 1, the contours on
the left side of each row indicate the temperature profile before
jet impingement. The subsequent contours show the temperature variation
after approximately 1 (named as 0) and 30 s surface exposure to the
cavitating jet. The reduced data obtained with the FLIR software (FLIR
Systems) from the analysis of the thermal contours of all cases are
presented in Figure 2. The detailed data for all cases are shown in Supporting Information.

Figure 1 Thermal contours captured by a thermal
camera on the solid surface
for different cases: (a) without spray exposure (152 μm), (b)
just after the exposure (152 μm), (c) 30 s after the exposure
(152 μm), (d) without spray exposure (504 μm), (e) just
after the exposure (504 μm), and (f) 30 s after the exposure
(504 μm). The selected box on the surfaces is the location where
the emerging cavitation jet hits the surface. This approach helps
to measure the mean temperature, where the most direct effect of the
spray jet impingement occurs. AR01 represents the most relative area
that the jet influences on the plate. It was tried to consider the
same area of 1 × 1 mm2 for all cases. However, as
the area which was directly impacted by the jet from the tube with
the inner diameter of 152 μm was less than 1 mm2,
a smaller area was introduced for this microtube.

Figure 2 Surface temperature rise as a function of upstream pressure: (a)
just after the exposure to the surface, (b) 30 s after the exposure,
and (c) 120 s after the exposure. The thermal contours are analyzed
at three time steps to monitor and confirm the stability and steadiness
of the temperature rise, which is needed to ensure reliable power
harvesting. The room temperatures for the selected experiment sets
were measured as 17.3, 19.3, 19, and 19.6 °C for the channel
configurations with diameters of 152, 256, 504, and 762 μm,
respectively. Overall, the extracted results shown in this figure
depict a consistent temperature rise between 0.8 and 5.7 °C for
all of the channels at different upstream pressures.

Figure 2a shows
that there is a temperature rise for all of the channels, starting
from upstream pressures of 10–60 bar, just after the emerging
cavitating jet contacts the surface. The largest temperature increase
is seen at an upstream pressure of 40 bar. Under this upstream condition,
the largest temperature rise is 2.6 °C in the microchannel configuration
with diameter of 152 μm. A temperature rise of 2.5 °C is
seen in the microchannel configurations with diameters of 256 and
504 μm at the same upstream pressure. The microchannel configuration
with diameter of 762 μm has an increase of 1.7 °C, which
is the lowest recorded temperature rise at this pressure. For all
of the channels, with an increase in the upstream pressure from 40
to 60 bar, the surface temperature either remains constant or moderately
decreases. The optimal pressure depends on the diameter in a way that
the optimal pressure for 504 μm is 40 bar, but the optimal pressure
for 152, 256, and 762 μm is 60 bar.

Similarly, Figure 2b illustrates, for
all of the cases, the reduced data corresponding
to 30 s after the exposure of the solid body to the cavitating flows.
As can be seen, the temperature increases with time. Further, as time
elapses, it can be seen that the rise in surface temperature becomes
saturated, which also implies an optimum rise in temperature for the
studied cases. The comparison of Figure 2b with Figure 2c reveals that temperature does not significantly change
between the time steps of 30 and 120 s after exposure, thus implying
steady-state conditions after a time lapse.

In the second time
step, the highest temperate rise is recorded
as 5.7 °C in the microchannel with inner diameter of 504 μm
at an upstream pressure of 40 bar. Because this temperature rise is
significantly higher than those for the other micro-/minichannel configurations,
additional experiments were performed to ensure the repeatability
of the results. This finding originated from the corresponding flow
patterns illustrated in Figure 3, especially when considering the flow patterns of the micro-/minichannel
configurations with inner diameters of 504 and 762 μm.

Figure 3 Flow patterns
at the outlet of the micro-/minichannels for different
upstream pressures at the first and last segments of the spray structure.
The emerging spray has a conical shape in almost all of the channels,
except that with diameter of 762 μm. The flow patterns significantly
change as the diameter of the channel shifts from 504 to 762 μm,
which implies a difference between micro- and macroscale cavitation
phenomena. (a.1) Di = 152 μm, Pi = 10 bar, segment 1; (a.2) Di = 256 μm, Pi = 10

bar, segment 6.

The temperature rise
obtained from the largest channel configuration,
which corresponds to a tube diameter of 762 μm, is smaller than
that in the other cases just after the spray exposure to the surface.
A rise of 3.2 °C is recorded for this configuration after a 30
s exposure, and the nearest result is 4.3 °C, obtained from the
configuration with diameter of 152 μm. The same trend of rise
in temperature with time occurs for all of the configurations. The
largest temperature rise, of approximately 4 °C, is attained
from the microchannel configurations with diameters of 504 and 152
μm. The experiments were repeated four times for each case,
where all showed reasonably similar outcomes. However, for the cases
which corresponded to peak points, the experiments were repeated two
or three times more than usual to ensure the repeatability of the
results.

To complement the results of the temperature profiles,
the flow
patterns are analyzed at the outlet of the channel configurations
using a high-speed visualization system and a laser shadow probe.
Visualization experiments are performed for all of the configurations
at six different consecutive segments throughout the spray, starting
from the channel exits. Each segment has a length of 3 mm. As shown
in Figure 3, for most
of the segments in the channels with inner diameters of 152 and 256
μm, the flow structures are similar. With the increase in diameter
from 256 to 504 μm, an intense separation of little droplets
from the main jet is observed. This is in agreement with the change
in the temperature rise trends mentioned earlier. As diameter increases
to 762 μm, the flow pattern becomes different and a bigger jet
comes out of the channel. This change in the flow pattern is accompanied
by a lower temperature rise. With an upstream pressure of 10 bar (Figure 3a.1–a.4 and 3b.1–b.4), the flow pattern changes slightly
by increasing the channel diameter. However, with the upstream pressure
of 40 and 60 bar, the droplet/bubble separation from the main flow
gets more intense along with the spray cloud, especially in the channel
with inner diameter of 504 μm. The transition from micro- to
macroscale cavitating flow is more apparent for the channels with
inner diameters of 504–762 μm at higher upstream pressures.
The detailed data for all cases are shown in Supporting Information.

The spray at the outlet section of the channels
experiences decomposition
along its length, which leads to increasing effects of disintegrated
droplets and bubbles from the cavitating jet, during the primary and
secondary breakups. The primary breakup leads to the generation of
big droplets/bubbles, which causes a dense region close to the orifice.
The next stage in the spray structure is a secondary breakup, where
smaller droplets/bubbles form from the big ones. The secondary breakup
occurs due to the resisting aerodynamic forces from the surrounding
gas acting on the droplets/bubbles. This resisting force reduces the
droplet velocity. Furthermore, at the tip of the spray, droplets tolerate
much higher drag forces. Therefore, at this location, droplets consistently
change to new ones and the spray length increases. Hence, additional
and faster droplets/bubbles interact with the solid body as time passes.

The intensity of cavitation is characterized via the cavitation
number, which is expressed as: σ = (Pref – PV)/0.5ρV2ref, where Pref is the reference pressure, which is the upstream pressure in this
study, PV is the vapor saturation pressure
(vapor saturation pressure for the working fluid is approximately
3500 Pa), and Vref is the reference velocity,
which is the mean velocity in the channel and measured using the flow
rate during the flow injection. Accordingly, the cavitation numbers
for the channels with diameters of 152 and 762 μm are 0.078
and 0.52, respectively, for the upstream pressure of 40 bar. Thus,
cavitation is more intense in channels with smaller diameters. There
is a similar trend for the cavitation number at the other injection
pressures.

The images in the first row of Figure 3 show the first segments at the upstream
pressure of 10 bar. At this pressure, the cavitation effects are not
intense for any of the channels, which is also in agreement with the
previous studies.13,24 The flow pattern at this pressure
and segment is mainly a liquid jet. However, in the last segment,
different flow patterns exist. For the channel with diameter of 152
μm and for the channel with diameters of 256 and 504 μm,
droplet separation and large perturbations, respectively, are observed
in the last segment. Large and small perturbations are also observed
in the channels with diameters of 256 and 504 μm, which tend
to form a spray jet under the minimal energy condition.

In the
third and fourth rows of Figure 3, the upstream pressure increases to 40 bar,
and in the fourth and fifth rows of Figure 3, the upstream pressure increases to 60 bar.
It can be seen in the fourth row (which is the sixth section of different
microtubes) that an intense breakup pattern exists for microtubes
with inner diameters of 152, 256, and 504 μm. As the upstream
pressure increases to 60 bar, this intense breakup pattern becomes
prevalent in all segments of the channels with diameters of 152, 256,
and 504 μm, which is accompanied by droplet/bubble separations,
suggesting a cloudy spray under the effect of cavitation. The effect
of this spray cloud becomes more dominant with increasing temperature
at higher injection pressures. However, entirely different patterns
can be seen for all segments of the channel with diameter of 762 μm.
The flow pattern resembles that of the liquid jet in macro-/conventional-scale
sprays, which is shown in the literature.25 Moreover, the cavitation numbers for the channels with diameters
of 504 and 762 μm are 0.39 and 0.52, respectively, for the upstream
pressure of 40 bar. According to the observations and trends in temperature
rise presented above, it can be concluded that there is a flow structure
change because of the shift from mini-/macroscale to microscale cavitation,
concerning the channels with diameters between 504 and 762 μm.

According to the results, cavitating flows are more intense for
the smallest channel configuration. However, those cavitating flows
hit a smaller surface area, where the rise in temperature contributes
less to the average temperature rise. Although this contribution is
greater for larger channel configurations, the cavitation intensity
is smaller. The interplay between exposed area and cavitation intensity
results in an optimal channel configuration for the average temperature
rise and consequent energy harvesting.

The temperature rise
with small-scale cavitating flows can be exploited
for energy harvesting using thermoelectric generators. According to
this study, the obtained power is in the range of the maximum power
gained from a thermal harvester, PMax =
(SΔT)2/4R, where S and R are the
Seebeck coefficient and resistance of aluminum, respectively. Even
taking into account that the energy conversion efficiency of existing
thermoelectric elements can be far from ideal (especially at lower
voltage values), it can be expected that a temperature difference
of 2–3 °C would result in an output power of around 300
mW,26 which can power devices such as radio
frequency receivers/transmitters, light-emitting diodes (LED), and
miniature sensors.

Figure 4 displays
the output power for the time step of 30 s. It can be seen that the
highest power is obtained from the channel with diameter of 504 μm,
which is in agreement with Figure 2b. At the upstream pressure of 40 bar, the maximum
reclaimable power is 0.316 W for this channel. This configuration
is followed by the channel with diameter of 152 μm. Although
cavitation is more intense in the smallest channel, jet impingement
exposure surface is limited compared to the other configurations.
Therefore, its thermal effects become less compared to those of the
channel with diameter of 504 μm. The channel with diameter of
762 μm delivers higher power output compared to the channel
with diameter of 256 μm. Although the jet impingement exposure
surface is the largest for the channel with diameter of 762 μm,
the transition in flow morphology results in a relatively lower power
output.

Figure 4 Output power generated as a result of the exposure of the solid
surface to the cavitating jets.

To illustrate the potential of energy harvesting, the required
power values for operation of some miniature electronic appliances
are included in Table 1. As can be seen, all of the reported (generated) power values are
within the range of the required power levels for these miniature
appliances. Under the studied conditions, the proposed system is capable
of powering approximately three light-emitting diodes and a digital
mini thermometer. The reclaimed power values serve as the preliminary
results and proof of concept for the proposed method. Necessary power
for consumer devices, such as cell phones, laptops, and devices in
offices, could be provided using this approach.

Conclusions
In this study, we showed that the exposure of small-scale cavitating
jet flows exiting different micro-/minichannel configurations has
the capability to increase the temperature on a thin solid surface,
which can be used to exploit energy. The preliminary results show
that the temperature rise ranges from 0.8 to 5.7 °C under the
experimental conditions. To support the temporal results, a detailed
set of visualization images was provided for different microtube diameters
and different upstream pressures. Various morphological patterns exist
for each case, and pattern shifts were also observed as the inner
diameter of the microtube increased from 504 to 762 μm. The
calculated obtainable power values can provide enough energy for many
basic miniature electronic appliances, such as cell phones, laptops,
and office devices. The only required input is a simple flow/injection
of a cooling fluid, which could be well provided by miniature/embedded
MEMS micropumps or recovery water lines from thermal fluid systems.
Thus, this approach has the potential of meeting personal energy needs
in an inexpensive and environment-friendly manner and offers considerable
advantages compared to other energy-harvesting devices in terms of
cost and energy implementation. Furthermore, the results could be
further improved by optimizing the injection conditions, designing
a functional solid surface having multiple cavitating jet arrangements,
and integrating it to effective thermoelectric power generators.

Experimental
Section
Experimental Setup
The cavitating-flow generation setup
used in this study is shown in Scheme 1. An aluminum plate with a surface of 1 × 1 cm2 and weight of 1.85 g is kept at a specific distance (1.8
cm) from the tip of the micro-/minichannels to act as the exposed
surface for impingement of the microjets resulting from the exiting
spray. The depth of the aluminum plate utilized in this study was
1 mm. Except certain cases, the area that was chosen to calculate
the effect of temperature rise was 1 × 1 mm2. In other
cases, such as the microtube with diameter 152 μm (which had
a smaller impact area), modifications in calculations were considered
to ensure a reasonable judgment. The tests are performed in four different
channel configurations with diameters of 152, 256, 504, and 762 μm,
respectively. In the presence of intense cavitating flows downstream
of the cavitating-flow generator device (micro-/minichannel acts as
a restrictive element connected to the stainless steel tube), a heating
effect can be accomplished. The temperature variations are recorded
using a thermal camera system, whereas the cavitating flows are visualized
using a high-speed camera system.

Scheme 1 Schematic of the Proposed System for
Generating Cavitation Bubbles
and Micro/Mini Cavitating Jets
A
high-pressure pure nitrogen
tank (Linde Gas, Gebze, Kocaeli, Turkey) supplies the required upstream
pressure for the system. This tank is connected to a 1 gal fluid reservoir
(Swagelok, Erbusco BS, Italy), which is filled with deionized water
and serves as the working fluid. The reservoir is connected to the
system with adapter fittings. Two pressure sensors (Omega) are mounted
at the entrance and end of the tubing system to measure the pressures.
Two fine control valves (Swagelok) are integrated to the system to
control the flow at the desired locations. A micro T-type filter (Swagelok)
with nominal pore size of 15 μm is used to filter any particles
larger than 15 μm.

Device Characterization
The setup generates cavitating
flows with flow-restrictive elements, which are microchannels with
different diameters. The stainless steel tubing with diameter of 4.5
mm is connected to these polyether ether ketone (PEEK) micro-/minichannels.
The connection between the tubes is accomplished with proper Swagelok
fittings to have a sudden reduction in diameter, thereby reducing
the static pressure, which leads to the generation of cavitation bubbles
and cavitating jet flows. Furthermore, the lengths of the PEEK channels
are adjusted in such a way that the generated bubbles and vapor phase
could reach the exit of the channels. Thus, this length is kept at
4.5 mm to better exploit the energy released from the collapse of
the cavitation bubbles. To reduce light reflection from the aluminum
plate and increase emissivity, besides the calibration of the thermal
camera, the plate is colored black.

Experimental Procedure
The experiments are carried
out in two separate steps. In the first step, temperature variations
on the aluminum plate are measured with the aid of the thermal camera
system. This plate is connected to the system via sustaining clamps,
which hold it against vibration. A thermal camera (FLIR Systems) and
a workstation with image postprocessing software capture the temperature
variations on the aluminum plate that result from its exposure to
the cavitating jet flows. The plate is held by means of suitable clamps
at a distance of 1.8 cm from the exit of the channel. The selected
upstream pressures are 10, 40, and 60 bar. The exiting jet is exposed
to the atmospheric pressure of 1 bar. Surface temperatures are recorded
at three different time steps for each micro-/minitube and each upstream
pressure. Time steps are selected as 0 (just after), 30, and 120 s
after the exposure of the surface to the cavitating flow.

In
the second step, the flow structure is visualized utilizing a high-speed
camera system for the aforementioned channels at different segments
relative to the exit of the microchannels and injection pressures.
The spray structure is divided into six identical segments from the
emergence of the jet at the outlet of the channel down to the location
where the cavitating jet interacts with the aluminum plate. Each segment
has a length of 3 mm. The visualization experiments are performed
at several upstream pressures ranging from 5 to 60 bar. To study the
spray formation in the different segments, the exposure time is adjusted
to a very low value of 1 μs. The images of the cavitating flows
are collected by a double-shutter CMOS camera, which allows the acquisition
of two successive images with a resolution of 1280 × 800 pixels
(pixel size of 0.02 mm) within a very short time delay. The CMOS camera
is equipped with a macro camera lens (type K2 DistaMax with focal
length: s = 50 mm and f-number: f = 1.2) and is mounted at a distance of 342 mm from the
imaging plane, yielding a magnification of M = 0.137.
This optical arrangement ensures that only the central region of the
lens is used, where aberration can be neglected. The images are exposed
in a background illumination mode using a pulsed LED array consisting
of 551 high-performance LEDs with a total area of 160 mm × 100
mm. In front of the LED array, an opaque plate is installed to produce
diffuse illumination. The typical duration of the light pulses is
0.05–0.07 ms, whereas the time delay between the two successive
images is adjusted to the local flow velocity in the range of 1–3
ms.

Flow Characterization
The mass flow rate is obtained
by measuring the fluid mass passing from the outlet cross-sectional
area over a given time period. The experiments are carried out at
a broad range of upstream pressures, and all temperature measurements
and visualization tests are repeated several times to ensure the reliability
of the obtained results. Using the manufacturer’s specification
sheets and also the propagation from the uncertainty propagation method
by Kline and McClintock,28 the average
uncertainties in cavitation number (±6.7%), flow rate (±1.4%),
inner diameter (±0.002 mm), and pressure drop (±0.3%) are
obtained.
