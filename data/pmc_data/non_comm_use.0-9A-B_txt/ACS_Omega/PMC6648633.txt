The
aim of this study was to investigate the effect of three synthesis
parameters on the morphology and composition of nanosized binary bioactive
glass particles (nBGPs) obtained through a modified Stöber
process. Syntheses were conducted by varying only one parameter at
a time while keeping the other parameters constant. As already mentioned
in the literature, the ammonium hydroxide volume conditioned the size
of the nanoparticles. Nonagglomerated monodispersed spherical particles
with a diameter between 70 and 452 nm were produced. The quantity
of calcium nitrate and the moment it was introduced in the sol had
a tremendous impact on the quantity of calcium inserted and on the
particle morphology and aggregation state. High Ca-content particles
were obtained when the calcium precursor addition time was 1 h or less after
the beginning of the sol–gel reaction but at the cost of a
strong aggregation. A better control on the morphology, polydispersity
and dispersibility of the nBGPs was achieved when the Ca(NO3)2 addition time was increased up to 6 h. However, a significant
decrease of the quantity of Ca2+ inserted was also noticed.
Using an intermediate (3 h) addition time, the quantity of calcium
nitrate has been optimized to maximize the insertion of Ca2+ ions inside the silica particles. Finally, an optimum initial Ca/Si
atomic ratio of 2, maximizing Ca insertion while limiting the salt
quantity used, was found. It led to the synthesis of particles with
a molar composition of 0.9SiO2–0.1CaO without any
side effect on the particle stability and morphological characteristics.

==== Body
1 Introduction
It
is has been established that bioactive glass particles (BGPs)
can form a direct and strong chemical bond with bones when implanted
in living tissues.1 In vitro studies conducted
in Simulated Body Fluid (SBF) showed that this bonding ability
is due to the formation of a hydroxyapatite (HAp) layer on the glass
surface.2 In addition, while the HAp layer
grows, the glass particles dissolve, leaving in the end, a completely
new bone matrix without any residue of the starting material. Hence,
they are one of the most promising biomaterials for bone tissue regeneration.2 In the 90’s, the advances in sol–gel
research marked a new turning point in the elaboration of BGPs traditionally
obtained by the melt-quenching route.3 This
wet chemistry process leads to the formation of an inorganic silica
network by mixing at room temperature the precursors, mostly alkoxides.
This route leads to the synthesis of materials with a pore volume
and a specific surface area higher (up to 2 orders of magnitude) than
the melt-derived ones. Because of the ability to form a HAp layer
being directly linked to the specific surface area, sol–gel
BGPs account for a higher bioactivity as reported by Sepulveda et
al.4 Moreover, for binary bioactive systems
(SiO2–CaO), the compositional range to show a bioactive
behavior is extended. BGPs with a SiO2 content up to 90%
mol can be produced, whereas with the melt-quenching route, the CaO
content has to be at least 50% mol.5,6 In addition,
the sol–gel method is extremely versatile, as the physical
properties such as particle size and morphology can be controlled
by playing on the process itself.7 A lot
of research is currently ongoing to reduce the size of the BGPs to
obtain increased specific surface area and thus increased surface
reactivity, leading to faster glass dissolution, hence improving bioactivity
properties. Also, it has been pointed out that nanosized bioactive
glass particles (nBGPs) could promote better human marrow mesenchymal
cell attachment and proliferation as compared to micron-sized bioactive
glass particles.8 Therefore, an improvement
of BG osteogenic properties can be expected at the nanoscale. Despite
their great potential for bone regeneration, they are not yet used
because of their novelty, leaving the autograft as the gold standard
procedure for load-bearing bones. Considering that the natural bones
can be described as composites composed of collagen fibrils and HAp
nanocrystals, there is a great interest for the elaboration of mimetic
nanocomposite scaffolds with nBGPs dispersed in a polymer.9−11 However, the aggregation of nBGPs in the polymer matrix reduces
the interaction between particles and the polymer structure, limiting
the toughness of the nanocomposite materials as compared to natural
bones.12 It is thus of tremendous importance
to synthesize BGPs which are both in the nanoscale and nonagglomerated.
A modified Stöber process allows obtaining such well-dispersed
nanoparticles.13 It involves the hydrolysis
and condensation of a silicon alkoxide precursor (usually tetraethyl
orthosilicate, TEOS) in an alkaline solution to obtain in the first
step SiO2 nanoparticles. The synthesis has to be performed
under strong basic conditions (ammonium hydroxide, NH4OH)
to lead to particles and not to a low-reticulated silica network.
Also, being at high pH induces a negative charge at the surface of
silica particles, which repel one another by electrostatic repulsion.
In the second step, a calcium salt is added (often calcium nitrate),
resulting in the adsorption of Ca2+ ions onto the surface
of the pristine silica particles. Calcium is only incorporated in
the silica network after a 400 °C thermal treatment (diffusion),
performed after a washing step. Ca2+ ions act as network
modifiers, reducing the glass network connectivity, thus providing
the bioactivity property.14 The calcium
addition step must be carefully controlled to avoid side effects such
as irregular morphology,15 inhomogeneity
in size,16 and aggregation.17 Beyond the importance of calcium ions in the
elaboration of bioactive systems, numerous studies investigated their
effect on biological responses. Maeno et al.18 figured out that osteoblast proliferation and differentiation are
enhanced in the presence of calcium ions, as well as extra cellular
matrix mineralization. Marie19 showed that
extracellular calcium ion concentration controls osteoblast differentiation
and proliferation via the activation of Ca-sensing receptors in the
osteoblast cells. Furthermore, in vitro studies carried out by Pereira
et al.20 showed that a high amount of calcium
ions incorporated in BGPs induced a fast nucleation of HAp crystals.
Thus, a fine control of the nBGP synthesis protocol with high calcium
content is critical to further improve the bioactivity and biological
properties of nanocomposite scaffolds. It has been reported that the
aggregation state, size, size dispersity, and morphology of nBGPs
with high calcium content (20% mol CaO) were optimized when the initial
Ca/Si molar ratio was of 1.3.21 Also, Greasley
et al.22 found out that this same ratio
was optimal for a maximal insertion of Ca2+ ions (9% mol
CaO) in monodispersed nBGPs. More recently, Zheng et al.23 reported that the timing of calcium nitrate
addition affected greatly the morphology, aggregation state, and composition
of nBGPs. Greasley et al.22 performed nBGP
synthesis slightly differently from the modified Stöber process
described previously, with a centrifugation step after the silica
particle formation and no washing steps after Ca2+ addition
and before thermal treatment. In the following, we present a one-pot
strategy to synthesize nBGPs and evaluate the impact of calcium nitrate
addition time and Ca/Si initial molar ratio on the nBGP morphology,
size, size dispersity, and calcium content. Also, to modulate the
specific surface area of the particles, ammonium hydroxide concentration
has been varied because it was recognized in the literature as the
major parameter impacting the size of silica particles in the Stöber
process.22

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Variation of NH4OH Concentration
The impact of ammonium hydroxide concentration
was investigated,
keeping all the other synthesis parameters constant. The initial Ca/Si
ratio was 0.2, and calcium nitrate was added after 24 h and the particles
were recovered and washed 3 h later. A range of NH4OH volume V from 0.75 to 3 mL was used. This corresponds to concentrations
from 0.14 to 0.57 M if one considers only ethanol as a solvent (water
being a reactant). Figure 1 shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the
nBGPs elaborated by this modified Stöber process, all presenting
a spherical morphology and being nonagglomerated. The size histograms,
fitted with log-normal distribution functions, give a precise insight
on the mean sizes and size dispersity. One can see that the nBGP mean
diameter increases significantly as the concentration of ammonium
hydroxide increases from 71 to 452 nm but that the size dispersity
stays always low (between 18 and 6%). Another indicator of the size
dispersity is the polydispersity index (PDI) measured by dynamic light
scattering (DLS). It is defined as: PDI = (σ/D)2 where σ is the standard deviation of the particle
diameter distribution and D is the mean particle
diameter. As it can be seen in Table 1, the PDI values are between 0 and 0.1, a range which
characterizes highly monodispersed systems.24 The mean diameters obtained by DLS are slightly higher than the
one previously presented for SEM measurements (from 87 to 485 nm).
This is perfectly consistent as DLS measures hydrodynamic diameters
(particle diameter plus the electric double layer and the hydration
shell). This size evolution versus ammonia concentration can be explained
by the synthesis mechanism. It is well-known that under Stöber
conditions, TEOS hydrolysis and condensation lead to the formation
of primary silica particles which then aggregate and form secondary
spherical particles. Then, Ostwald ripening induces a homogenization
of the particle size through the dissolution of the smallest particles
used to feed the bigger ones.25 In addition,
because of the high pH value induced by the presence of NH4OH (above the isoelectric point of silicic acid), the silica particles
newly formed remain well-dispersed and are very stable, thanks to
their negative surface charge.26 Therefore,
increasing the ammonium hydroxide concentration above a critical value
promotes the formation of large primary particles, resulting in the
formation of larger, well-separated, and monodispersed silica particles
with a negative surface charge as evidenced by the zeta potential
values (see Table 2). The specific surface area of the particles was assessed by nitrogen
sorption (SBET). This parameter is known
to impact the dissolution rate of bioactive glasses and thus their
bioactivity because it characterizes directly the glass active surface
which can interact with the surrounding environment (physiological
media).27 The adsorption–desorption
isotherms of the particles are of type III (see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information), characteristic of nonporous
materials according to the IUPAC classification. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area decreases from 45 to 7 m2/g as the particle
size increases (see Table 1). These values are higher than those of melt-derived bioglass
45S5 microparticles (0.15–2.7 m2/g)4 and are consistent with other studies reported on sol–gel-derived
bioactive glass nanoparticles.28,29 Using the size histograms
obtained from SEM micrographs, the theoretical specific surface area
(SSEM) of the particles was calculated
(see the Supporting Information for calculation
details). For the calculations, we assumed a density of 2.2 g/cm3. This value is slightly higher than the density of Stöber
silica particles,30 as bioactive glasses
synthesized are dense and nonporous and contain calcium, which is
heavier than silicon. One can notice that the SSEM and SBET values are quite similar
(see Table 1), proving
that particles are not aggregated. It has been reported that the immobilization
of Ca2+ ions onto the surface of the silica particles changed
their surface chemistry, resulting in particle aggregation.31 Here, 24 h after the beginning of the sol–gel
process, the particles might have been very stable, and thus, the
impact of Ca2+ addition in the media on aggregation is
rather small. Decreasing the NH4OH concentration below
0.14 M led to agglomerated particles. The sizes obtained here are
in accordance with the results of Greasley et al.,22 even though their synthesis protocol differed after the
silica particle formation step, underlining the fact that the particle
size is defined during this first step, no matter the way Ca2+ ions are then inserted in the silica matrix. After the washing steps,
only the Ca2+ ions that are ionically bonded with the OH
species covering the particle surface still remain and then diffuse
in the silica network via a thermal treatment at 650 °C. As already
mentioned in the literature, such a high temperature is not mandatory
for ion diffusion14 but is necessary to
remove the remaining nitrate ions at the particle surface. Figure 2 shows the X-ray
diffraction (XRD) patterns of the nBGPs synthesized with different
ammonium hydroxide concentrations. As it can be seen, no diffraction
peaks were observed, confirming the amorphous nature of the nBGPs.32 One important result here is that it is possible
to obtain bioactive glass nanoparticles as small as 70 nm, with a
low size dispersity and being nonaggregated with the modified Stöber
process described in this study. In summary, we showed that ammonium
hydroxide concentration has a great influence on the size of the bioactive
glass nanoparticles. Indeed, increasing slightly its concentration
results in a significant increase of the nBGP size, while a homogeneous
spherical shape and a narrow size distribution are maintained. However,
its concentration has to be maintained over a certain value to avoid
the decrease of the double layer thickness of silica particles, which
can promote aggregation.33

2.2 Variation of the Calcium Salt Addition Time
The impact of calcium nitrate addition time was investigated, keeping
all the other synthesis parameters constant. The NH4OH
concentration was fixed at 0.21 M and the Ca/Si ratio at 0.2. CaNO3 addition was performed between H = 30 min
and 6 h after the beginning of the sol–gel reaction. All the
obtained nBGPs are purely amorphous (see XRD patterns, Figure S2 in
the Supporting Information). The transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) images of the nBGPs obtained at H = 30 min (nBGP + 30 min) and H = 1 h
(nBGP + 1 h) are shown in Figure 3. It can be seen that nBGP + 30 min particles are strongly
aggregated and present an irregular morphology. On the contrary, nBGP
+ 1 h particles exhibit a spherical morphology with a rather homogeneous
size (∼150 nm), but they are still aggregated. The Figure 4 shows the SEM images
of nBGP + 2 h, nBGP + 3 h, nBGP + 4 h, nBGP + 5 h, and nBGP + 6 h
particles. All of them are nonaggregated and exhibit a spherical morphology.
The mean diameter and the size distribution evaluated by a log-normal
function fit of the histograms are, respectively, 154 ± 18, 158
± 13, 150 ± 15, 184 ± 22, and 173 ± 19 nm. One
can notice that the bioactive nanoparticles are monodispersed in size
(standard deviation of about 11%) and that there is no significant
difference between the particle diameters. It is well-known that the
addition of an electrolyte in the solution during a sol–gel
synthesis can impact the final structure of nBGPs because it impacts
the colloidal stability of the pristine silica particles.33 Thirty minutes after the TEOS hydrolysis/condensation
process, silica particles are not fully formed and are very reactive
because of their small size. When the calcium salt is added, the overall
electrostatic interaction is strongly attractive and the Ca2+ ions act as cross-linkers between the silica particles, hence destabilizing
the particle dispersion. The nBGP + 30 min particles (see inset Figure 3a) are thus highly
clustered with irregular morphology. This result is in good agreement
with the work of Zheng et al.23 In the
case of nBGP + 1 h, the silica particles are a bit less reactive than
the former ones. As a consequence, attractive electrostatic interactions
are less effective and nBGPs are only moderately aggregated (see the
necking parts in the inset Figure 3b) with a uniform spherical morphology. Over 1 h, the
colloidal stability is high enough for not being impacted anymore
by the attractive electrostatic interactions induced by the addition
of the calcium salt. The corresponding nBGPs are then nonaggregated
and exhibit a spherical morphology with a uniform size distribution.
In summary, the variation of the calcium salt addition time does not
have a significant impact on the nBGP size but strongly influence
their shape and aggregation state. An early addition of the calcium
salt in the reaction media irreversibly destabilizes the colloidal
suspension of silica particles because of the strong electrostatic
interactions, resulting in their aggregation. The addition of the
calcium salt thus have to be performed at least 2 h after the beginning
of the sol–gel reaction. In the study of Zheng et al.,23 this threshold time was at 30 min. The difference
with the present study could be explained by the different synthesis
conditions used, such as a larger initial Ca/Si ratio (0.614) and
a larger NH4OH concentration (1 mol·L–1).

The composition of the particles
synthesized with different calcium
salt addition times H has been investigated using
energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) to unravel its influence
over the quantity of calcium effectively inserted in the silica matrix.
The results are presented in Figure 5. When added early in the reaction system, at H = 30 min and 1 h, respectively, 100 and 90% of the amount
of calcium initially in the media has been incorporated. At H = 2 h and H = 3 h, a decrease of this
quantity is noticed (37% incorporation) and a significant drop can
be seen at H = 4, 5, and 6 h (down to about 16% incorporation).
This kind of deviation between the nominal and actual nBGP composition
has already been reported and is for a part, a consequence of the
washing step which removes the soluble calcium salt in the pore liquor
(condensation byproducts), resulting in a lower amount of calcium
nitrate deposited onto the surface of silica particles during the
drying step.29 However, washings are mandatory
because of the remaining unreacted precursors in the reaction media
which could still react and form impurities or aggregate the particles.21 Nevertheless, this is not the main factor impacting
the nBGP composition. The reactivity of the silica particles is closely
related to its surface which is covered by silanol groups.26 The pH of the solution being higher than the
isoelectric point of silicic acid (pH = 2.2), the silanol groups are
deprotonated, resulting in a negative surface charge as already mentioned.
It is thus obvious that the number of silanol groups available at
the silica particle surface when the calcium salt is added will strongly
influence the composition of the synthesized nBGPs. At H = 30 min and H = 1 h, hydrolysis and condensation
still being ongoing, a maximum of these active sites might be available
to create strong attractive electrostatic interactions with Ca2+ ions. Therefore, all (or almost all) the calcium is adsorbed
onto the particle surface, resulting in a high quantity of Ca2+ ions inserted in the silica network after washing and calcination
procedures. In the course of the sol–gel reaction, the negative
charge density at the particle surface probably decreases because
of the Ostwald ripening process, leading to the formation of larger
silica particles. Hence, fewer active sites remain available to interact
with the Ca2+ ions, resulting in a significant gap between
the nominal and the actual composition of the nBGPs, as observed for
the samples obtained at H = 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 h.
These results are in perfect agreement with the ones of Zheng et al.,23 who pointed out for the first time that the
calcium salt addition time had a significant impact on the actual
composition of the nBGPs. In their study, the initial Ca/Si ratio
was 0.614 and the resulting Ca/Si ratio in the synthesized nBGPs was
0.1 (16% insertion) for a Ca2+ addition time of 30 min
and 0.03 (5% insertion) for 1 h after the beginning of the sol–gel
reaction. With the idea of maximizing the calcium content, Kozon et
al.34 and El-Rashidy et al.35 also synthesized monodispersed nBGPs with a
modified Stöber method using a calcium nitrate addition time
of H = 30 min. The initial Ca/Si ratios were, respectively,
of 0.4 and 1, leading to final Ca/Si ratios within the particles of
0.03 (7.5% insertion) and 0.07 (7% insertion). The amount of calcium
inserted in the particles in the former three studies was thus much
lower than the ones presented here (0.2 and 0.18 for H = 30 min and 1 h, respectively). It might be explained by their
use of a larger concentration of NH4OH (1 mol·L–1), which resulted in the synthesis of larger particles
(about 400 nm). It is interesting to mention that one could tailor
the synthesis protocol depending on the application foreseen for the
particles. If the particles are to be used as cement (e.g., mixed
with blood to make a paste that would be pressed into bone defects),
the fact that the particles are aggregated is not necessarily a drawback.
In that case, an early addition of calcium will permit to obtain a
highly bioactive material, thanks to the high calcium content. On
the contrary, if well-dispersed nBGPs with uniform spherical morphology
and a narrow size distribution are required, for example, to disperse
them in a polymer matrix to obtain a nanocomposite material or to
disperse them in an injectable preparation which would polymerize
at body temperature and fill bone defects, nBGPs such as nBGP + 2
h or nBGP + 3 h should be used.

vs the precursor addition
time H for an initial Ca/Si ratio of 0.2.

2.3 Variation of the Initial
Ca/Si Ratio
In the previous section, we reported that spherical
and nonagglomerated
nBGPs with a narrow size distribution and a fair amount of calcium
incorporated in the silica network could be achieved by adding the
calcium salt in the reactive media 2 or 3 h after the beginning of
the sol–gel reaction. Another parameter, the initial atomic
ratio between Ca and Si, could also have an impact, so it was investigated
while keeping all the other synthesis parameter constant. The NH4OH volume was fixed at 1.12 mL (C = 0.21
M) and the CaNO3 addition was performed 3 h after the beginning
of the reaction. The initial Ca/Si ratio was varied between 0.2 and
3.5. All the obtained nBGPs are purely amorphous (see the XRD patterns,
Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). The obtained particles are all nonagglomerated as shown in the
SEM images in Figure 6 and present a mean diameter around 180 nm with a standard deviation
of about 10%. The amount of calcium salt added in the reaction media
thus had no impact on the colloidal stability of the particles, nor
on their size and size dispersity. EDXS shows that the amount of calcium
present in the nBGPs increases with the initial Ca/Si ratio (see Figure 7). A saturation is
reached at Ca/Si = 2 with an effective Ca/Si ratio of about 0.1, which
is higher than the optimal ratio value of 1.3 reported by Greasley
et al.22 This saturation can be explained
by the limited number of available site for Ca2+ ions to
adsorb onto the particle surface. No further increase can happen due
to the washing steps which remove nonadsorbed ions. However, it is
important to notice that for an initial Ca/Si ratio of 2, only 5%
of the Ca2+ ions are incorporated in the silica particles,
which is not cost effective. Despite the smaller size of the particles
studied by Greasley et al.22 (about 100
nm) and thus their higher specific surface area, the quantity of calcium
in the final nBGPs was not higher than the one we presented here.
Playing on both the addition time and the initial quantity of calcium
salt is thus of tremendous importance for one to optimize the calcium
content in the synthetic nBGPs.

3 Conclusions
A one-pot-modified Stöber route was used to elaborate monodispersed
nBGPs (SiO2–CaO). The influence of ammonium hydroxide
concentration, calcium nitrate addition time (H),
and initial Ca/Si atomic ratio upon the morphology, mean size, size
dispersity, aggregation state, and composition of the nanoparticles
has been investigated. The results showed that increasing the ammonium
hydroxide concentration induced an increase of the mean bioactive
glass nanoparticle diameter, while the timing of calcium salt addition
(for H ≥ 2 h) in the media and its quantity
had no significant impact on its size. All particles were monodispersed
in size and nonagglomerated, except for syntheses where calcium was
added 1 h or less after the beginning of the sol–gel reaction
(H ≤ 1 h). Regarding the composition of the
nanoparticles, the results showed that the timing of calcium salt
addition and the initial Ca/Si ratio had a tremendous impact. For
syntheses with H ≤ 1 h, despite their strong
agglomeration, the particles showed a high Ca content. However, for H > 1 h, the quantity of Ca2+ ions inserted
in
the silica matrix decreased significantly. Also, it was found out
that the initial Ca/Si ratio had a significant impact on the final
composition of particles. The amount of calcium inserted increased
when increasing the initial Ca/Si atomic ratio from 0.2 to 2 and then
reached a plateau. On the light of the results obtained in this systematic
study, it is now clearer and easier to understand the effect of the
main synthesis parameters on the morphology and composition of bioactive
glass nanoparticles obtained through a modified Stöber protocol.
Future studies will focus on the bioactivity and the evaluation of
the cytocompatibility of those nanomaterials to assess their possible
benefits for bone tissue regeneration.

4 Materials
and Methods
4.1 Materials
TEOS (99%), ammonium hydroxide
solution (28.0–30%), and calcium nitrate tetrahydrate (Ca(NO3)2·4H2O) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Absolute ethanol (99.5%) was obtained from VWR Chemicals. All reagents
were used as received without any further purification.

4.2 Synthesis
The bioactive glass nanoparticles
were obtained following a modified Stöber route. Three parameters,
(i) ammonium hydroxide concentration, (ii) the moment of addition,
and (iii) the quantity of calcium nitrate, were varied while keeping
all the other parameters constant to unravel their impact on the size
and morphology of the BGPs and on the quantity of calcium inserted
in the silica network. Briefly, two solutions were prepared separately
at room temperature. The solution 1 was obtained by rapidly pouring
2.34 mL of TEOS in 20 mL of absolute ethanol and the solution 2 by
mixing 11.7 mL of deionized water, 17.5 mL of absolute ethanol, and
a concentration C of ammonium hydroxide ranging from 0.14 to 0.57
M (V = 0.75–3 mL). After keeping these solutions
under mechanical stirring for 30 min, the solution 1 was dropped in
the solution 2 and left to mix for a certain time H. After H hours, a certain quantity of calcium nitrate
dissolved in 1 mL of water, corresponding to a Ca/Si ratio ranging
between 0.75 and 3.5, was added to the resulting turbid solution and
left under stirring for (24 – H) hours. The
white suspension was collected by centrifugation (6297g/20 min) and washed with ethanol and water to remove nonreacted reagents.
The obtained white solid was dried overnight at 60 °C and then
heat-treated at 650 °C for 3 h to remove the remaining nitrate
ions and to allow the incorporation of calcium into the amorphous
silica network.

4.3 Characterization
The size and size
distribution of nBGPs were investigated by TEM using a Hitachi H-7650
microscope operating at 80 kV. Micrographs were obtained by using
a Hamamatsu camera placed in a side position. For TEM observation,
the powders were dispersed in deionized water and sonicated for 10
min. Then, 10 μL of the suspension was deposited on carbon-formvar
copper grids and left for drying overnight at room temperature. The
morphology of the particles was also investigated by field emission
SEM using a Zeiss Supra 55VP microscope operating at 3 kV, with a
working distance in a range of 4.9–5.3 nm. The particles were
deposited on a conductive carbon tape (no metallization necessary).
The particle size distribution was determined by the measurement of
the diameter of more than 200 particles from TEM/SEM micrographs using
the ImageJ processing software. The mean diameter and the size dispersity
were obtained by fitting the size histograms with a log-normal distribution
function. Chemical composition has been determined by EDXS in
the scanning electron microscope using an X-MAX 80N spectrometer
silicon drift detector (Oxford Instruments) coupled to the Oxford
Instruments Aztec Advanced software. For EDXS measurements, the samples
were pressed into pellets and deposited on a carbon film (no metallization).
The experimental Ca/Si ratios were calculated by dividing the measured
atomic percentage of Ca measured by the measured atomic percentage
of Si. Error bars on Ca/Si values are calculated as: Δ(Ca/Si)
= Ca/Si × [(ΔCa/Ca) + (ΔSi/Si)] where ΔCa and
ΔSi are the standard deviation of Ca and Si atomic percentages
in three measurements. A calibration was performed by measuring the
Ca and Si content of different ceramic powders of known Si and Ca
concentrations. DLS and zeta potential measurement were performed
using a Zetasizer Nano apparatus (Nano-ZS, Malvern Instruments). The
powders were suspended in deionized water and sonicated for 10 min
before the measurements. Powder XRD patterns were recorded using a
D2 phaser (Bruker) diffractometer equipped with a Cu Kα anode,
in the range 2θ = 20°–40° and with a step size
of 0.016°. The specific surface area of nanoparticles was assessed
by nitrogen sorption measurements conducted on a sorptometer (Micromeritics
TriStar II Plus). Before the analysis, the samples were degassed under
vacuum overnight at 150 °C. The surface specific area was calculated
using the BET equation on the adsorption branch.
