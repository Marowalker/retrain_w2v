In this work, we
have attempted to improve electromagnetic interference
(EMI) shielding and mechanical behavior of epoxy/carbon fiber (CF)
composite, simultaneously, in the presence of functionalized carbon
nanotubes. It is well understood that properties of composite depend
on the interface between the filler and matrix. Considering this basic
understanding, functionalized carbon nanotubes/epoxy nanocomposites
were impregnated into a bidirectional carbon fiber (CF) mat and, further,
various mechanical and EMI shielding behaviors were studied. Multiwalled
carbon nanotubes were functionalized with branched poly(ethyleneimine)
(b-MWNT) to tailor the interface of epoxy/CF composites. Laminates
with two layers of CF were fabricated with functional MWNT modified
epoxy. Scanning electron microscopy was used to analyze the microstructure
of epoxy/CF laminates. Lap shear test was performed to analyze adhesion
between the modified epoxy and carbon fiber. Further dynamic mechanical
analysis in the temperature range of 30–160 °C was performed.
Thermal degradation of composites was studied using a thermogravimetric
analyzer. Electrical conductivity of laminates was measured using
a four-point method on an Agilent probe station. EMI shielding effectiveness
(SE) was measured for 0.5 mm-thin laminates in the Ku band. The b-MWNT
modified epoxy/CF composites showed excellent SET of ca.
−60 dB and SEA of ca. −50 dB, which are of
commercial importance. Compared to unmodified epoxy/CF, b-MWNTs/epoxy/CF
exhibited 200% increment in EMI SET and 35% enhancement
in storage modulus due to the improved interface between the epoxy
matrix and carbon fiber.

1 Introduction
Epoxy (Ep)/carbon fiber
(CF) composites have brought extensive
technological advancements in different sectors due to their versatile
properties.1 Epoxy/carbon fiber composites
provide a combination of strength and modulus of matrix and filler,
ease of fabrication, low density, high strength to weight ratio, and
so on.2 These composites are nonisotropic
in nature and hence design of components is difficult to compare to
that of pure metals or polymers. However, this also provides the additional
benefit of tailoring the properties depending on requirements. The
replacement of metals with composites has led to reduced weight of
aircraft and hence extensively improved efficiency has been achieved.
In these composites, in-plane load is carried by the directional fiber,
whereas out-of-plane load is transferred by the matrix and interface.3 Hence, developing a better interface between
the filler and matrix remains an active research area among the industry
and academia. Improved interface reduces the possibility of debonding
and hence increases the load-bearing property of the composite.4 Considering these requisites, researchers have
continuously attempted to functionalize carbon fiber or epoxy resin
with various nanoparticles, such as clay, graphene, montmorillonite,
and carbon nanotubes (CNTs), to obtain enhanced properties depending
on a wide range of applications.5−14 Owing to the exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal behaviors,
CNT have always attracted the attention of researchers.15,16 In one of the studies by Kepple and co-workers, multiwalled carbon
nanotube (MWNT) was grown on carbon fiber using the chemical vapor
deposition technique and four layered composites were prepared using
structural epoxy. These composites were subjected to fracture testing,
and fracture toughness was increased by 50% with no structural stiffness
loss.17 Bekyarova et al.18 developed multiscale CNT/CF preform by the electrophoresis
technique, followed by epoxy composite fabrication using vacuum-assisted
resin transfer molding (VARTM). They reported 30% increment in interlaminar
shear strength and higher out-of-plane electrical conductivity. Godara
et al.19 studied the effects of functionalized
and nonfunctionalized CNTs on the mechanical properties and processing
of epoxy/carbon fiber composites.

Nowadays, epoxy/carbon fiber
composites are the preferred materials
for aircraft structure. Current technologies involved in aircraft/satellite
design include a highly efficient on-board electronics control system,
which leads to electromagnetic perturbations. It can also be caused
due to the gadgets or electronic devices used by the boarders.20 For example, during launch and orbiting of satellites,
their communication system is prone to electromagnetic interference
(EMI) and hence EMI shielding is required.21 These disturbances can also lead to the loss of data in the communication
system. The improper functioning or performance of any electronic
device or system arises due to the interference of electromagnetic
waves coming out from nearby devices. Hence, to avoid or minimize
the effect of electromagnetic interference, various shielding materials
have been employed. The ability of a material of shielding EM waves
is expressed in terms of EMI shielding effectiveness (SE), given in
terms of decibel (dB). There has been very little study carried out
to understand the EMI shielding behavior of epoxy/CF composites. Shah
et al.22 reported reflection loss of −26.8
dB at a frequency of 4.9 GHz for arrayed CF/gradiently dispersed Fe
nanoparticle-filled epoxy matrix. Apart from EMI shielding behavior,
it is important to understand the mechanical and thermal responses
of shielding materials. Because during the service life of shield
materials, they have to undergo both mechanical and thermal cycles,
there is the possibility of performance deterioration. Hence, it becomes
important to study the overall behavior of EMI shielding materials.
In the current work, we have attempted to simultaneously improve EMI
shielding as well as mechanical and thermal properties of epoxy composites;
such materials have potential for use in a wide range of applications.

In our previous work, we studied the functionalization of carboxylic
acid terminated MWNTs (c-MWNTs) with branched poly(ethyleneimine)
(BPEI) and their effects on mechanical and thermal behaviors of epoxy
matrix.23 In the current study, we have
attempted to simultaneously improve the dynamic mechanical and EMI
shielding behavior of epoxy/CF composites. To this end, first the
epoxy matrix was modified with BPEI functionalized MWNT (b-MWNT),
followed by CF composite fabrication. We modified the epoxy with b-MWNT,
rather than functionalizing the CF mat itself, which adds to the mechanical
disintegration of the mat on account of the harsh chemical treatment
involved. Poly(ethyleneimine) has the ability of forming cross-bridges
with CF to improve the interface with the matrix epoxy. From our previous
study, we understood that amine-terminated BPEI helped in tailoring
the interface between the epoxy and MWNT. Hence, this work addressed
the concerns often encountered in laminates/sheets designed to shield
a specific device from incoming EM radiation, especially concerning
the fate of the material (thermal cycles). The heat-map of the laminate
on interaction with the incoming EM radiation is studied systematically
along with the dynamic mechanical properties. Improved interface together
with good dissipation makes these laminates/composites an alternate
solution in the quest of lightweight and effective shielding materials.

2 Experimental Details
2.1 Material and Composite
Fabrication
Bisphenol-F-based epoxy resin (prepolymer) of
molecular weight ≤700,
along with diamine hardener was used as the matrix, provided by Axson
Technologies. MWNT was obtained from Nanocyl, Belgium, branched poly(ethyleneimine)
(BPEI) (Mn = 25 000) was procured
from Sigma-Aldrich, and bidirectional woven carbon fiber mat (average
diameter 7 μm) was bought from Hindoostan Technical fabrics.

In our previous work, synthesis and characterization of BPEI functionalized
MWNTs from carboxylic acid terminated MWNTs have been explained. In
this work, first, epoxy nanocomposites with 1 wt % of c-MWNT and b-MWNT
were prepared using the sonication-mechanical mixing method. For this
work, we used a low-weight fraction of MWNTs, that is, 1 wt %, because
higher concentration of MWNTs leads to the formation of agglomerates.
Presence of such agglomerates hinders the cross-linking of epoxy polymers
and hence can lead to premature failure of the material. Vacuum-assisted
resin transfer molding (VARTM) technique was used to prepare two-layered
CF laminates. CF mats were kept at 0° angle, followed by the
infusion of b-MWNT/epoxy and c-MWNT/epoxy. Table 1 shows the details of the sample prepared
and the code used throughout the article. Scheme 1 shows the different steps involved in fabrication
of CF laminates, which include synthesis and dispersion of functionalized
MWNTs, preparation of epoxy nanocomposites, impregnation of epoxy
nanocomposites into CF mat, followed by vacuum bagging and oven curing
to obtain the cured CF laminates.

2.2 Characterization
JPK atomic force
microscopy (AFM) was used to image the surface of c-MWNT and b-MWNT
in tapping mode. The morphology and cross section of different epoxy/CF
composites were observed under an FEI ESEM Quanta 200 scanning electron
microscope (SEM). Lap shear test was carried out at 0.5 mm min–1 under tensile loading to measure the adhesion strength
of different epoxy nanocomposites with a CF surface. Electrical conductivity
of thin laminates was measured using the four-probe method on Agilent
probe station. EMI shielding effectiveness was measured using a vector
network analyzer in the range 12–18 GHz on samples of dimension
15 × 8 × 0.5 mm3. Thermomechanical behavior was
analyzed using Dynamic Mechanical Analyzer from TA instruments. Thermal
degradation studies were carried out on Netzsch thermogravimetric
analyzer (TGA) in the temperature range of 30–900 °C in
air. Thermal mapping of various CF laminates was carried out by irradiating
EM wave of frequency 18 GHz for 10 min.

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Morphology of Functionalized
MWNTs
AFM is an effective tool to image variation in the
surface topography
of nanoparticles.24 Tapping mode AFM was
employed to characterize the morphology of different MWNTs. Samples
were dispersed quite well in ethanol and spin-coated on silicon wafer. Figure 1a,b shows the AFM
micrographs and height image of c-MWNTs and b-MWNTs. Surface undulations
of MWNTs increased on functionalization with BPEI, which suggests
the presence of polymeric chains on their surface. Again from the
height image, the increase in the circumference of c-MWNTs on covalent
functionalization was clearly evident. The average diameter of c-MWNTs
was 10 nm, whereas b-MWNTs showed increased diameters of 20–22
nm.

3.2 Lap Shear
Strength Measurement
Adhesive
joints were prepared using neat epoxy, c-MWNT/Ep, and b-MWNT/Ep as
adhesives and a carbon fiber reinforced polymer composite-based substrate.
Substrates were abraded up to lap length to remove polymer (epoxy)
so that a bare CF surface is obtained. It is important to remove surface
polymers from the substrate because for our studies we need to understand
the adherence behavior of different modified epoxy nanocomposites
with a CF surface. Furthermore, different epoxy adhesives were applied
on clean substrates. Both substrates were held using a spring clamp
to ensure uniform spread of adhesive on the CF surface, and excess
adhesive material was removed. Later, these specimens were cured in
an oven. Scheme 2 shows
the different steps involved in the sample preparation for a single
lap shear test. Lap shear experiment was conducted under tensile loading
at room temperature according to standard ASTM D1002. Nanoparticles
are known to increase adhesive strength due to the improved dispersion
state in the matrix, which enlarges the interaction area between the
adhesive and adherent. It has been found that CNTs can show strong
binding in the direction of applied shear.25−27 The force curve
as a function of strain was obtained (see Figure 2), and Table 2 enlists the lap shear strength measured for various
epoxy nanocomposites. Lap shear strength for b-MWNT/Ep composites
was found to be 19.7 MPa, nearly 100 and 40% increment compared to
neat epoxy and c-MWNT/Ep nanocomposites, respectively. From the force–strain
graph, it can be suggested that the presence of b-MWNTs has increased
the failure strain of epoxy along with the lap shear strength of epoxy.
It can be concluded that b-MWNT can bind better with the adherent
under shear. It also explains the improvement in interface between
CF and epoxy due to the presence of functionalized MWNTs.

function of strain for different epoxy nanocomposites.

3.3 Microstructure of Laminates
Figure 3 shows the microstructure
of different Ep/CF composites with and without functionalized MWNTs.
It is important to understand the role of epoxy nanocomposites with
c-MWNTs and b-MWNTs on wettability of the CF surface. From Figure 3a, it can be clearly
seen that there is debonding between CF and matrix (red highlight)
due to the weak interface. These regions were minimized in case of
c-MWNT/Ep/CF composites, which can be attributed to the presence of
c-MWNTs in epoxy (Figure 3b). In case of b-MWNTs/Ep/CF, the adherence between the adjacent
fibers was improved. The presence of BPEI in b-MWNTs/Ep assisted in
bridging individual CFs; this can further improve load transfer between
the filler and matrix. Such morphologies can enhance the overall mechanical
and thermal behavior of composites. Furthermore, we obtained highly
magnified SEM micrographs of b-MWNTs/Ep/CF laminates to evaluate the
localization of functionalized MWNTs in the laminate. From the SEM
micrographs, it was clearly evident that b-MWNTs were also present
on the edges of epoxy matrix and closer to the surface of CF. From
the lap shear experiment, it was seen that b-MWNTs/Ep has better adherence
to the CF surface compared to that of neat epoxy and c-MWNTs/Ep. This
can be attributed to the enhanced interface between epoxy and CF due
to the presence of b-MWNTs.

and (c) b-MWNT/Ep/CF
laminates; (d) and (e) SEM micrographs of b-MWNTs/Ep/CF composite
at 20k and 70k magnification.

3.4 Electrical Conductivity
Electrical
sheet resistance (Rs) of CF laminates
was performed using four-probe measurements at room temperature (ASTM
F76). Further electrical resistivity was calculated from the van der
Pauw technique. It provides the average resistivity of an arbitrary-shaped
sample. For our work, rectangular-shaped CF laminates of thickness
(t) 0.5 mm were cut and silver paste was applied
on the corners to ensure proper contact of probes with the sample
surface. Electrical resistivity, ρ, and conductivity for CF
laminates were calculated.

From Table 3, it was observed that electrical resistance
possessed by b-MWNT/Ep/CF was the highest among composites. Similarly,
its electrical conductivity was the lowest compared to that of c-MWNT/Ep/CF
and Ep/CF composites. This can be explained from the fact that BPEI
is an insulating polymer that forms an interface between epoxy and
CF. There was no significant change in resistance value, which suggests
that the contribution of CF is more prominent than that of various
modified epoxies. These composites are conducting enough to create
a Faraday cage to shield devices against incident EM waves.

3.5 EMI Shielding
Effectiveness
As discussed
earlier, EMI SE provides information about attenuation of the propagating
EM waves caused by the shielding material. It is obtained using a
two-port vector network analyzer (VNA) in a given frequency range
in terms of S-parameters, scattering parameters (S11, S12, S21, S22). Shielding
is mainly governed by three mechanisms, namely, reflection (R), absorption
(A), and multiple reflection (M). Total shielding effectiveness (SET) can be calculated from the following equation      Figure 4 shows SET as a
function of frequency for c-MWNT/Ep/CF
and b-MWNT/Ep/CF composites in the range of 12–18 GHz. Two-port
VNA was coupled with waveguide setup using an SMA type
of connector. Before the measurement, short-open-load-through calibration
was carried out. It was observed that c-MWNT/Ep/CF could shield up
to −50 dB, whereas b-MWNT/Ep/CF showed EMI SE of −60
dB. Polymer composites are inhomogeneous in nature, unlike metals
or conducting polymers. In the present study, heterogeneous junctions
were formed consisting of functionalized MWNTs, epoxy, and CF. These
types of junctions interact with EM waves differently and decrease
the energy of EM waves by absorption and multiple reflection. Reflection
mechanism can be explained from the high electrical conductivity shown
by the composites. SER was similar for all of the three
composites because reflection contribution comes mainly from the CF
surface due to high electrical conductivity. SER shown
by different composites was nearly −10 dB (Figure 5) and contributes little to
the overall SE of the composites. On further investigation, we found
that the major shielding effectiveness contribution is from the absorption
mechanism. Ep/CF composites showed the lowest SEA value
of approx. −15 dB. Interestingly, addition of 1 wt % of functional
MWNTs, that is, c-MWNTs and b-MWNTs in Ep/CF composites, exhibited
excellent absorption of EM waves. SEA for c-MWNTs/Ep/CF
and b-MWNTs/Ep/CF composites was found to be approx −39 and
−50 dB, respectively, at various frequencies (Figure 6). This can be further explained
by the heterogeneity generated in Ep/CF composites by the inclusion
of c-MWNTs and b-MWNTs. These functional MWNTs form an interface or
nonuniform interfacial junction between the epoxy matrix and CF. It
is well known that MWNTs possess free electron cloud on their surface.
These functional MWNTs retain charge cloud to a certain extent even
after functionalization. Furthermore, the charge accumulation at the
interface also contributes to the higher absorption of EM waves in
Ep/CF.28 The relatively higher value of
SEA for b-MWNTs/Ep/CF can be explained by the better dispersion
of b-MWNTs in the epoxy matrix and hence leading to better and multiple
interfacial junctions with CF. In our work, we observed that there
were certain undulations in SE values at higher frequencies of 16–18
GHz. This can be attributed to mainly the nonuniform formation of
a conductive mesh between the epoxy nanocomposite and CF.29−33 It can also be explained by the fact that at higher frequencies,
these conductive networks formed in the modified laminates effectively
convert EM energy into heat and leakage current.34

3.6 Thermal Mapping
Thermal mapping of
various CF laminates was carried out by irradiating EM waves of frequency
18 GHz for 10 min. Further thermal response of laminates was scanned
using a Fluke Ti 25 IR (fusion technology) thermal sensor (Figure 7a). High-frequency
EM wave irradiated on the Ep/CF laminate does not show significant
increase in temperature, as seen in Figure 7b. Composites with 1 wt % of c-MWNTs and
b-MWNTs showed a slight increase in temperature by 1–2 °C,
as observed from thermal maps. This is due to the presence of residual
functional groups attached to the surface of carboxylic MWNTs and
BPEI functionalized MWNTs (Figure 7c,d).35 CF and MWNTs show
excellent thermal conductivity due to which heat dissipation in CF
composite is quite efficient.36−38 This can further be attributed to the
thermal stability of CF laminates while irradiation and absorption
of EM waves.

CF laminates (b) Ep/CF, (c) c-MWNTs/Ep/CF, and (d) b-MWNTs/Ep/CF.

3.7 Dynamic
Mechanical Analysis
Dynamic
mechanical analyzer is an efficient tool to analyze the mechanical
behavior of a material as a function of temperature.39Figure 8 represents the storage modulus of CF laminates as a function of
temperature. The experiment was performed in the temperature range
of 30–160 °C, frequency 10 Hz, and amplitude 15 μm.
Ep/CF showed a storage modulus of 17 GPa, whereas c-MWNT/Ep/CF showed
an increment of approx. 18% in storage modulus with 20 GPa. b-MWNT/Ep/CF
exhibited the highest storage modulus of 24 GPa. This can be attributed
to the enhanced interface between the modified epoxy and CF mat.40 b-MWNTs form a better interface due to the enhanced
dispersion in the epoxy matrix.41 Furthermore,
b-MWNTs hinder the mobility of Ep/CF under mechanical loading and
hence improve the stiffness of the composite. The plastic behavior
in b-MWNTs/Ep/CF composites initiates only after 110 °C, which
explains that these composites can be used at higher temperatures
without material failure.

3.8 Thermal
Degradation
In case of polymer
composites, it becomes important to analyze the thermal degradation
temperature. On degradation, polymer breaks down into small molecules
CO, CO2, NO, and so on, which are harmful in nature. Figure 9 represents the percent
weight loss of CF composites as a function of temperature. TGA analysis
for composites was performed between 30 and 900 °C. CF composites
showed only one slope at 350 °C, which is the degradation temperature
of the epoxy matrix. There was no observable degradation shown by
carbon fiber.

4 Conclusions
In this work, we studied the effects of b-MWNTs on EMI shielding
as well as the thermal and mechanical behaviors of Ep/CF composites.
The morphology of functionalized MWNTs was obtained from AFM. CF laminates
were fabricated with different modified epoxy systems using the VARTM
technique. The microstructure of laminates was examined under SEM,
and it was observed that b-MWNTs/Ep formed a better interface with
the CF surface. Lap shear strength was measured for different epoxy
nanocomposites on the CF substrate. It was found that b-MWNT/Ep showed
a lap shear strength of 19 MPa, which was 110% higher than that of
neat epoxy. EMI SE was measured in the frequency range of 12–18
GHz. SET for b-MWNT/Ep/CF was found to be −60 dB,
and the storage modulus was as high as 24 GPa. b-MWNTs/Ep/CF composites
exhibited excellent absorption behavior, having an SEA value
of maximum −49 dB at 17 GHz. Such materials with excellent
EMI shielding along with mechanical and thermal characteristics are
of commercial importance to aircraft industries where the communication
system works in the Ku band.
