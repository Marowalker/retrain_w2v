Conjugates
based on cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are scientifically
relevant owing to their structural complexity; their ability to enter
cells and deliver drugs, labels, antioxidants, bioactive compounds,
or DNA fragments; and, consequently, their potential for application
in research and biomedicine. In this study, carboxyamidated fluorescently
labeled conjugates FAM-GG-TAT(47-57)-NH2 and FAM-PEG6-TAT(47-57)-NH2 and photosensitizer-labeled conjugate
Chk-PEG6-TAT(47-57)-NH2 [where TAT(47-57)
is the CPP, 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein is the (FAM) fluorophore, chlorin
k (Chk) is the photosensitizer, and the dipeptide glycyl–glycine
(GG) or hexaethylene glycol (PEG6) is the spacer] were
originally designed, prepared, and fully characterized. Practically,
all chemical reactions of the synthetic steps (peptide synthesis,
spacer incorporation, and conjugation) were microwave-assisted at
60 °C using optimized protocols to give satisfying yields and
high-quality products. Detailed analyses of the conjugates using spectrofluorimetry
and singlet oxygen detection showed that they display photophysical
properties typical of FAM or Chk. Anticandidal activity
assays showed that not only this basic property of TAT(47-57) was
preserved in the conjugates but also that the minimal inhibitory concentration
was slightly reduced for cells incubated with PS-bearing conjugate
Chk-PEG6-TAT(47-57)-NH2. Overall,
these results indicated that the synthetic approach on-resin assisted
by microwaves at 60 °C is simple, straightforward, selective,
metal-free, sufficiently fast, cleaner, and more cost-effective than
those previously used for preparing this type of macromolecule. Furthermore,
such new data show that microwaves at 60 °C and/or conjugation
did not harm the integrity of the conjugates’ constituents.
Therefore, FAM-GG-TAT(47-57)-NH2, FAM-PEG6-TAT(47-57)-NH2, and Chk-PEG6-TAT(47-57)-NH2 have high potential for practical applications in biochemistry,
biophysics, and therapeutics.

Introduction
Chemical compounds
with the ability to enter cells or specifically
affect them are the front-runners in the quest to fight diseases.
Hence, there is a growing interest in the chemistry and structure
of cell-penetrating or cell-modifying agents as well as in the fundamental
mechanisms by which they interact with cellular membranes and their
model counterparts, the lipid membranes.

Cell-penetrating peptides1 (CPPs) are
short amino acid sequences2 able to enter
different cells;3−5 thus, they have been named “biological Trojan
horses”6 and have been employed
in cellular delivery of cargoes such as DNA,7 siRNA,8 organic halide,9 ruthenium complex,1089Zr-labeled antibody for PET imaging,11 low-molecular-weight chitosan,12 and
fluorescent dyes.13 This strategic property
has also increased the interest on CPP interaction with biological
membranes (BMs) and their uptake pathways14 as well as has aided understanding BM properties. Because BMs are
very complex supramolecular fluids, simplified models or biomimetic
membranes (BMMs)15−17 have frequently replaced them in biophysical studies.
In fact, studies with BMMs have also helped investigating cell internalization
mechanisms. A good example is the work of Dennison et al., who found
out that penetration is affected when hydrophobic molecules are attached
to TAT.18

Among the hundreds of CPPs
identified so far,19 TAT peptides are perhaps
the most studied and found in
practical uses. TAT peptides are fragments of the human immunodeficiency
virus 1 protein containing 86–102 amino acid residues and exhibiting
three domains responsible for transactivation, DNA binding, and nuclear
transport,14 one of them being the arginine-rich
basic domain 48–60 (GRKKRRQRRRPPQ).20 TAT(47-57), YGRKKRRQRRR,21 is frequently
employed for covalent binding to peptides, proteins, fluorophores,22 chelators,23 and
DNA,7 with the aim of delivering them to
different cells through translocation across their plasma membranes.
Such examples illustrate the high interest in TAT(47-57)-based conjugates
in research and biomedicine. In the last case, the following information
speaks for itself: in 2015, Fosgerau and Hoffmann stated that 140
peptide drugs were in clinical trials and more than 500 therapeutic
peptides in preclinical tests;24 this year,
Lau and Dunn are reporting: “over 60 peptide drugs have been
approved in the United States, Europe, and Japan; over 150 are in
active clinical development, and an additional 260 have been tested
in human clinical trials”.25

Selective covalent binding between a CPP and a cargo to produce
a conjugate involves consideration of their chemically reactive groups
and structural properties, selection of a suitable synthetic approach,
and establishment of conditions. Most studies on TAT peptide-based
conjugates containing the cargo covalently bound to the CPP have employed
(i) traditional solid-phase synthesis (in which all reactions are
performed at room temperature), (ii) exposure of the resultant fully
protected CPP to acidic conditions for the release of the crude unprotected
TAT, and (iii) conjugation in solution.20,22,26−30 In fact, up to 2014, the on-resin method seemed to be less used
than the in-solution method for the conjugation of variable cargoes
with TAT or linker-TAT prepared on-resin. Among the conjugates prepared,
some have a spacer between the TAT peptide and the cargo, such as
a disulfide carbonate linker,30 PEG6,31,32 or an amino acid side chain,20 but others have the cargo molecule directly
connected to the terminal amino acid.28 Conjugates DFO-Suc-TAT(47-57), DFX-TAT(47-57), and DFO-Suc-TAT(49-57),
where Suc was succinic acid and DFO and DFX were desferrioxamine and
deferasirox, respectively, are examples of spacer-containing TAT-based
conjugates fully synthesized on-resin23,33,34 as the conjugation of DFO-Suc occurred at the N-terminus
of the TAT peptide-resin, a highly selective approach carried out
traditionally (at room temperature) or at 60 °C using conventional
heating.

The present study is a step forward for the chemistry
and development
of CPP-based conjugates as it originally encompasses (i) the design
of new potentially useful carboxyamidated TAT-based conjugates; (ii)
their on-resin syntheses assisted by microwaves at 60 °C using
optimized protocols; (iii) chemical, photophysical, and biological
analyses of the conjugates to verify if conjugation and/or microwaves
at 60 °C had any impact on the typical properties of the conjugate
constituents. Indeed, despite having structural similarity with conjugated
variants of TAT(47-57) previously reported, FAM-GG-TAT(47-57)-NH2, FAM-PEG6-TAT(47-57)-NH2, and Chk-PEG6-TAT(47-57)-NH2 [where TAT(47-57):
CPP, FAM: fluorophore 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein, Chk: photosensitizer
chlorin k, GG: glycyl–glycine, and PEG6: hexaethylene
glycol] have never been reported. Additionally, (i) the photosensitizer
Chk has not been conjugated with a peptide and (ii) although
solid-phase synthesis has been used to make this type of conjugate,
very few employed microwaves for the synthesis of TAT(47-57) or TAT(47-57)-NH2 and no one used microwaves at 60 °C with the protocols
that we have been establishing and appraising. Moreover, detailed
analysis of the conjugates to assess if they displayed typical properties
of their constituents (and, therefore, if the synthetic approach used
is suitable for the synthesis of such macromolecules) is unique.

The motivations for using fluorophore FAM and photosensitizer Chk as TAT(47-57)-NH2 cargoes were the following:(a) 5-Carboxyfluorescein
and 6-carboxyfluorescein
(5-FAM and 6-FAM, respectively) display fluorescent properties with
absorption at 492 nm and emission at 518 and 515 nm, respectively.35 Because of the high cost and difficulty to separate
them, the two isomers are commercially available and used as a mixture
commonly abbreviated as FAM.36,37 FAM is probably the
most popular fluorescent dye used for labeling and imaging applications35 involving peptides,38−40 proteins,41 and oligonucleotides.36 FAM-labeled peptides and proteins have been widely used to understand
their interactions with BMs39,42,43 or BMMs.44,45

(b) a PS is a molecule singlet in its
ground state that, when exposed to appropriate quantum energy, goes
to an unstable singlet excited-state and loses its energy excess either
by light emission (fluorescence) or heat production (internal conversion).46 When the PS excited state undergoes electron/energy
transfer reactions, several oxidant species (including 1O2) are generated.47 These
photochemical processes have been intentionally used to kill/induce
death and destroy targeted cells and/or tissues in photodynamic therapy
(PDT),48 where a PS is administered and
activated by light in a specific wavelength.49 To overcome their low selectivity50 and
hydrophobicity,51 the PSs have been conjugated
to saccharides,52 proteins,53 antibodies,54 polymers,55 and peptides,50 including
CPPs.56−58



Results and Discussion
Design
of New CPP-Based Conjugates
Figure 1 shows the chemical structures
of the building blocks of the target conjugates. Either the properties
of the CPP TAT(47-57), FAM, and ChK cited above or the
following information served as background for their design:1. Peptide carboxyamidation
certainly
would help obtaining TAT(47-57)-based conjugates chemically more stable
in physiological media because carboxypeptidases would not act on
them.

2. Glycyl–glycine
(12 atoms) and
PEG6 (21 atoms) could act as spacers for coupling of FAM
or Chk to 1R (Scheme 1) as they could minimize steric hindrance
between the bulky fluorescent and phototherapeutic cargo and, consequently,
help preserving the photophysical properties of such building blocks.
In addition, the spacers’ polar nature was expected to increase
water solubility of the conjugates.59 Furthermore,
they are chemically and biologically inert. Indeed, PEGs of low molecular
masses are also reported to display low cytotoxicity; thus, PEG6 would not significantly interfere in potential cell toxicity
displayed by intermediate PEG6-TAT(47-57)-NH2 and by conjugates FAM-PEG6-TAT(47-57)-NH2 and
Chk-PEG6-TAT(47-57)-NH2.

3. Although the antimicrobial
peptides
(AMPs) have the ability to kill bacteria and fungi by disrupting their
plasma membrane or affecting a specific intracellular target,60 PSs can do the same by inducing oxidative stress
at multiple cellular targets. Therefore, it is not surprising that
conjugates of PS-AMPs have been assembled and examined on their potential
for use in antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (PDT).61

Synthesis of the TAT(47-57)-Based Conjugates
In the
present study, we projected that the synthesis of the designed conjugates
would be even faster and relatively more environmentally friendly
if experimental conditions very similar to those established by us
for manual peptide solid-phase synthesis at 60 °C using conventional
heating,62,63 recently used for making iron-chelating
TAT conjugates,34 were adapted for the
new compounds and for conduction on the CEM equipment under N2 stirring and microwave irradiation at 60 °C. It is essential
to highlight that the protocols employed are somewhat different from
those often used for microwave-assisted solid-phase peptide synthesis
as our couplings and deprotections are not as fast as those regularly
described,64,65 but they have been proven to
minimize amino acid enantiomerization,62 a critical aspect to be considered when high temperature and microwaves
are used in synthetic chemistry of peptide and peptide-based compounds.

Scheme 1 summarizes
all steps of the synthetic route. Each chemical reaction was monitored
by the Kaiser test66 of the corresponding
resin, peptidyl-resin (1R), spacer-peptide-resin (2R and 4R), or conjugate-resin (3R, 5R, and 6R) beads.

Step 1: Microwave-Assisted
Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis of 1R
TAT(47-57)
was assembled on-resin to obtain peptidyl-resin 1R, which
was divided into three parts for the preparation
of the target conjugates. To our knowledge, this is the first report
on the synthesis of this TAT peptide using the approach and protocols
described here. Confirming our previous studies on microwave-assisted
SPPS at 60 °C,62,63 this combination was efficient
and shortened the assembling of 1R in comparison to that
performed earlier using traditional SPPS23,33 or SPPS at 60 °C using conventional heating.34 In fact, under the conditions used, the Fmoc-removal reactions
were accomplished within 5 min and the acylation reactions were completed
within 20 min, except for the acylation of the growing peptidyl-resin
by Fmoc-Arg7(Pmc)-OH that had to be repeated for completion.
Peptide cleavage from resin/full deprotection of about 10 mg of 1R gave crude product 1 containing the desired
amidated TAT(47-57) as the major component, as shown by RP-HPLC (conditions
in Table S1) and LC/ESI-MS (Figures S1
and S2 of Supporting Information).

Step
2: Introduction of Spacer Gly-Gly or PEG6 into 1R To Obtain 2R or 4R, Respectively
Two subsequent acylations of 1R by Fmoc-Gly-OH followed
by Fmoc removals were done with microwaves at 60 °C using optimized
protocols and HOBt/DIC for carboxyl group activation.62 Peptide-resin weight gain (13 mg) and analysis by LC-ESI/MS
(LC conditions in Table S1) of crude product 2 obtained from peptide cleavage/full deprotection of 2R (about 10 mg) indicated that (i) the dipeptide was successfully
incorporated into the fully protected CPP-resin and (ii) despite the
microwaves and high temperature used, such incorporation occurred
with very low extension of Fmoc removal from acylating reagent Fmoc-Gly-OH
and/or its active ester (2R) formed in the reaction medium.39,63,67

Likewise, and under similar
conditions using HATU/DIPEA for carboxyl activation,68,69 two reactions of 30 min were needed for the total attachment of
the PEG6 spacer to 1R, which was confirmed
by resin weight gain (10 mg) and analysis by LC-ESI/MS (LC conditions
in Table S1) of crude product 4 obtained from peptide cleavage/full deprotection of a small sample
of 4R (10 mg). This result is in agreement with previous
attempts to incorporate PEG6 to a peptidyl-resin.68

Step 3: Attachment of FAM to 2R and 4R To Produce 3R and 5R, Respectively
The coupling reaction was also carried out
on-resin with microwaves
at 60 °C using optimized protocols and BOP/HOBt/DIPEA for carboxyl
activation.39,42 Monitoring by the Kaiser test
showed that the reaction starting from 4R was faster
than that starting from 2R: indeed, to be completed,
the first required 60 min (2 × 30 min) and the second demanded
90 min (3 × 30 min). Because the same molar excess of FAM was
used and knowing that this is a bulky compound (Figure 1), these results revealed that the size and
nature of the spacer play a decisive role in the incorporation of
the cargo molecule into the spacer-CPP-resin. In addition, they suggest
that such attachment would be sluggish if carried out at room temperature
and/or were not assisted by microwaves. Weight gains of 2R and 4R (7 and 10 mg, respectively) and analyses by
LC-ESI/MS of crude products 3 and 5 (LC
conditions in Table S1) resulting from
peptide cleavages/full deprotections of small samples of 3R and 5R (about 10 mg of each) indicated that the target
conjugates were finally obtained.

Step 4: Attachment of Chk to 4R Aiming
at Obtaining 6R
Inspired by a previous work,70 the coupling reaction was performed under orbital
shaking at 60 °C for 14 h using HATU/HOBt/DIPEA and our customized
protocols for acylation of peptide-resins. In this case, the reaction
was not microwave-assisted because, due to limitation of Chk, the volume of the reaction media (1.5 mL) did not reach the minimum
volume (3 mL) required for the oven/apparatus employed. Again, the
weight gain of 4R and analytical data (LC conditions
in Table S1) of crude product 6 confirmed that the coupling was completed to give the desired conjugate 6 as the major component.

Steps 5–7: Conjugate
Detachment from the Resin/Full Deprotection
on Semipreparative Scale, Purification of the Crudes, and Characterization
of Purified Compounds 1–5
Analysis by
RP-HPLC and LC-ESI-MS of the crudes obtained gave exactly the same
results found for those obtained on analytical scale (Figures S1 and S2 of Supporting Information);
thus, conditions for purification by RP-HPLC were established (Table S1), except for conjugate 6 used in its crude form. The RP-HPLC profiles and mass spectra of
the final compounds allowed the evaluation of their purity degrees
and confirmed their identities. Table 1 describes the purification yields as well as the purity
degrees and peptide contents of purified compounds 1–6. As expected, because the synthetic arginine-rich peptide
conjugates are cationic and were purified using a TFA-based solvent
system, they contain trifluoroacetate (TFA–) counter
ions, which explains the ions of higher mass/charge ratios (m/z) detected and listed in the same table.
Such a statement was confirmed with the help of RP-HPLC of purified
TAT(47-57)-NH2 using a formic acid-based solvent system
to swap the TFA– followed by Direct Infusion Mass
Spectrometry analysis of the eluted peptide (data not shown). Detailed
results are shown in the Supporting Information.

Altogether,
the results above demonstrated that the combination
of SPPS and microwave irradiation at 60 °C using optimized protocols
was extremely beneficial for the total synthesis of the target macromolecules.
Positively, the microwave-assisted on-resin steps at 60 °C (aminoacylations
of the resin or peptide assembly, Fmoc deprotections, and acylation
of the CPP-resin by FAM or PEG6) occurred with reasonable
yields and were sufficiently fast, selective, metal-free, reasonably
priced, and, also, relatively clean. These features satisfy the increasing
worldwide demand for faster, more selective, and cleaner means to
prepare fine chemicals of high quality with satisfactory yields. Additionally,
the high speed and cost-effectiveness of the synthetic approach used
in the present study are especially important features if B. Merrifield’s
statement in his Nobel lecture (1984) is considered: “...When
a multistep process, such as the preparation of a long polypeptide
or protein, is contemplated, the saving in time and effort and materials
could be very large...”.

Photophysical Properties
of the Purified Synthetic Conjugates
Because conjugates 3, 5, and 6 were fully or mostly
synthesized under microwave irradiation at
60 °C expecting to obtain new conjugates with potential for practical
uses, chemical characterization (for identity confirmation and, consequently,
demonstration of structural integrity) and examination of the basic
properties of their constituents (light absorption, fluorescence emission
and/or photodegradation, antimicrobial activity with and without illumination)
were conducted, using FAM and ChK as references. Altogether,
the results indicated that we succeeded in our endeavor as the conjugates
obtained were the desired ones with the desired properties.

Figure 2 shows the
light absorption and fluorescence emission spectra of all compounds
at equivalent concentration. The similarity of profiles (presence
of identical bands) in Figure 2a–c indicated that FAM’s photophysical properties
were preserved in the conjugates, meaning that microwaves at 60 °C
and/or incorporation of any of the two spacers followed by conjugation
were harmless. The significantly lower intensities of the band at
440 nm in Figure 2b,c
(for FAM-containing conjugates 3 and 5)
in comparison to those in Figure 2a (for free FAM) are probably explained by the existence
in 3 and 5 of a covalent bond between the
fluorophore and spacer-TAT(49-57)-NH2. This hypothesis
finds support in similar observations made by Li et al. when comparing
the photophysical properties of FAM-containing peptides with those
of free FAM.40 Conversely, the fluorescence
signals in the spectra of 3 and 5 were not
drastically reduced: actually, a little positive effect was observed
in b and c, indicating that the conjugation did not create any channel
of nonradiative deactivation of the excited singlet state. It appears
that this is the first work to use spacer Gly-Gly or PEG6 for the conjugation of this fluorophore to TAT(47-57) and to demonstrate
whether FAM’s properties were preserved. Indeed, for instance,
in previous works, FAM was directly linked to the N-terminal of the
peptide-resin71−73 or to a C-terminal linked by a Lys44 or, yet, used as a modified FAM (carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl
ester).45

Figure 2 Absorbance (left axis; solid line) and
emission (right axis; dashed
line) spectra of (a) FAM, (b) conjugate 3, (c) conjugate 5, (d) chlorin k, and (e) conjugate 6 at the
same concentration.

With respect to the spectra
recorded for Chk and Chk-containing conjugate 6, they were also very
similar (Figure 2d,e),
indicating preservation of photophysical properties of the PS after
conjugation. As described above, either the intensities of the two
bands at 400 and 650 nm or the fluorescence of the conjugate was partly
reduced.

Experiments of singlet oxygen detection were carried
with Chk, conjugate 4, and conjugate 6 in
60% acetonitrile (ACN)/0.09% TFA in H2O to compare their
chemical stabilities and consequent preservation of the phototherapeutic
(singlet oxygen generation) properties of the PS even when covalently
bound to the PEG6-TAT peptide (4). Reading
scans at 1200–1360 nm obtained after exposure of their solutions
to a laser at 410 nm demonstrated that 4 provided a low-intensity 1O2 signal, but Chk and Chk-containing conjugate 6 presented equivalent high-intensity
signals (Figure 3),
meaning that the conjugation did not influence this photosensitizer
property. The 1O2 lifetimes measured in the
solvent used were 13.4 μs for Chk and 13.7 μs
for conjugate 6, which are very similar to the lifetime
value reported previously for 50% ACN in H2O (15–22
μs).74

Figure 3 Photosensitized singlet
oxygen generation and detection for free
Chk (solid black line), conjugate 4 (solid
gray line), or conjugate 6 (dotted line).

The photostabilities of the conjugates synthesized 3, 5, and 6 were also examined by
laser
irradiation of their solutions at identical concentrations, followed
by registration of their UV/vis absorption spectra every 5 min for
50 min. The photodegradation curves of FAM and its conjugates (3 and 5) at 440 nm are shown in Figure 4a. As observed, the absolute
value of absorbance is smaller for the conjugate. However, whereas
absorbance readings for FAM varied from 0.062 to 0.040 (difference
of 0.022) in 50 min of exposure to light, absorbances for conjugates 3 and 5 were considerably stable (varying from
0.031 to 0.029; difference of 0.003). Therefore, it is possible to
uphold that photodegradation was not as prominent for the conjugate
as for the free FAM.

3 (●),
and conjugate 5 (▲) and of (b). chlorin k (■) and conjugate
6 (●) at the same concentration.

Figure 4b
shows
the decay curves obtained for Chk and for Chk-containing conjugate 6 at 410 nm. Despite the difference
of intensity, the pattern is definitely the same, clearing any possible
effect of the conjugation on such specific Chk’s
property. These results are also supported by a previous study focused
on conjugates composed by porphyrins bound to a cationic antimicrobial
peptide61 as discussed below.

Antimicrobial
and Cell-Penetrating Activity of the Purified
Synthetic Conjugates
Knowing that TAT peptide (47-58), a
carboxyl-free analogue of TAT(47-57)-NH2 used as CPP in
the present study, has the ability to inhibit the growth of bacteria
and Candida albicans cells (AMP activity)
without hemolytic effect on human erythrocytes, penetrate, and localize
in the nucleus of HeLa and Trichosporon beigelii cells (CPP activity),75,76 liquid growth inhibition
assays were performed to verify whether the new conjugates also presented
anticandidal activity. Compounds 1, 2, and 4 were used as controls. Candida parapsilosis was chosen as the target microorganism because likewise C. albicans it is involved in infections of major
clinical importance. In addition, its significance and prevalence
has been dramatically increased.77

Table 2 describes
the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) found. Those of conjugates 3, 5, and 6 revealed that the synthetic
approach used, the incorporation of a spacer followed by covalent
binding of FAM or Chk, did not extinguish the antimicrobial
activity displayed by compound 1, the building block
TAT(47-57)-NH2. On the other hand, the slightly higher
MIC observed for conjugate 5 could suggest that either
the nature of the cargo or the length of the spacer may have an impact
on the bioactivities of TAT-based conjugates (indeed, conjugate 5 has FAM as cargo instead of Chk present in conjugate 6; conjugate 3 contains a GG as a spacer instead
of PEG6 present in conjugate 5). Anyway, the
overall results were very satisfying because they reinforced that
each building block of the conjugates reported here had its basic
properties preserved. Although the MICs found are higher than those
usually reported for antibiotics,77 they
are at the concentration range often found for antimicrobial peptides
and CPPs with antimicrobial activities,78−80 including TAT(47-57),76 as well as they are consistent with the contemporary
literature in which labeling of AMPs and/or CPPs with FAM has been
explored to better investigate by fluorescence microscopies their
mode of action on microbes;39,42 their interactions
with BMs,39 BMMs, or intracellular targets;
and drug delivery. Thus, no further experiment in this direction seemed
to be required in the present study. Overall, such results support
the idea that the new conjugates have potential for practical applications.

Because conjugate 6 contains a PS as a cargo molecule
covalently bound to a CPP with anticandidal activity (thus being an
antifungal cationic PS), assay against C. parapsilosis cells was also carried out with irradiation by a led array at 408
nm. As predicted, light irradiation slightly increased the yeast susceptibility,
which was strongly suggestive of conjugate 6 cell internalization:
in fact, cell penetration and light irradiation may have allowed the
Chk present in its structure to cause oxidative stress,
potentiating the anticandidal activity observed in the dark.

Conclusions
We have designed, synthesized, and characterized original TAT(47-57)-based
conjugates that can find practical uses owing to their photophysical
properties, anticandidal activity, and high potential to enter the
nucleus of bacterial, fungal, and human cells. To our knowledge, this
is the first study to either conjugate Chk to a peptide
or employ microwave irradiation at 60 °C for solid-phase synthesis
of TAT(47-57)-based conjugates (peptide synthesis, incorporation of
a spacer, and conjugation). Some features of the synthetic approach
and protocols employed are in agreement with the principles of green
chemistry.

Experimental Section
Synthesis of Cell-Penetrating Peptide-Resin
(1R)
TAT(47-57) was manually assembled on a
solid support (Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis; SPPS) using 9-Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) chemistry
using protocols
established in our laboratory for microwave-assisted SPPS at 60 °C,62,81 which were adapted to the target compounds. Fmoc-Arg(Pmc)-OH, Fmoc-Gln-OH,
Fmoc-Lys(Boc)-OH, Fmoc-Gly-OH, and Fmoc-Tyr(tBu)-OH were used as acylating
reagents, purchased from Bachem, NovaBiochem-Merck (Germany), or ChemPep.
The reactions (couplings) and Fmoc removal (deprotections) required
for peptide chain assembly on-resin were carried out in a 25 mL polypropylene
vessel placed into the microwave cavity of the 300 W single-mode manual
microwave peptide synthesizer (CEM, Discover SPS) using 60 °C
as the setup temperature. Although power pulsing sequences of 5 W
for 20 min were used for coupling steps (2.5 equiv of Fmoc-amino acid,
2.5 equiv of N,N′-diisopropylcarbodiimide
(DIC), 2.5 equiv of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt), and 1 equiv of
the resin or the peptide-resin in DMF), 20 W for 5 min were used for
deprotections (25% 4-methyl-piperidine in DMF). Reactions were stirred
by N2 bubbling, and their temperatures were monitored continuously
with a fiber optic probe inserted into the reaction vessel; the volumes
varied from 13.0 to 15.0 mL. To obtain a C-terminal C(O)-NH2 using 4-(2′,4′-dimethoxyphenyl-Fmoc-aminomethyl)phenoxy,
resin of 0.3 mmol/g substitution degree (Rink amide, Bachem) was employed.
Coupling and deprotection reactions were followed by alternate washing
with DMF, MeOH, and 25% DMSO/toluene and monitored by the Kaiser test66 on growing peptide-resin. The resultant peptide-resin
was washed and dried under vacuum. The resin weight gain was determined
by gravimetry comparing the starting mass of resin and the final mass
of peptide-resin.

Incorporation of Spacer Gly-Gly (2R) or PEG6 (4R) to 1R
The glycines
were subsequently incorporated into the CPP-resin (1200 mg) using
the customized protocols and conditions cited above. Fmoc-NH-PEG6-COOH (2.5 equiv) from Iris Biotech (Germany) was coupled
to 150 mg of the peptide-resin using HATU (2.5 equiv) and DIPEA (5
equiv) in DMF (3.5 mL) under microwave irradiation for 2 × 30
min at 60 °C. The progress of each reaction was also monitored
by the Kaiser test.66

Attachment
of 5(6)Carboxyfluorescein (FAM) to 2R and 4R (3R and 5R)
FAM, purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich, reacted with peptide-resin 2 or 4 also using the following conditions:39 FAM (5 equiv), BOP (5 equiv), HOBt (5 equiv),
DMF (3.5 mL), DIPEA (15 equiv), and 100 mg of 3 or 5 in DMF for 2 × 30 min. The reactions were also assisted
by microwaves at 60 °C (5 W). They were also monitored by the
Kaiser test.66

Incorporation of Chlorin
k (Chk) into 5R (6R)
Chk, purchased from Frontier
Scientific, reacted with modified peptide-resin 5 under
conditions similar to those described above: Chk (2.5 equiv),
HATU (2.5 equiv), HOBt (2.5 equiv), and 50 mg of 5 in
DMF (1.5 mL) for 14.5 h under orbital shaking at 300 rpm and at 60
°C. The reaction progress was monitored by the Kaiser test.66

Peptide Detachment from Resin and Simultaneous
Full Deprotection
This step was performed suspending 10 mg
of the 1R–6R peptide-resin (analytical
scale) or 100 mg
of 1R, 2 × 100 mg of 2R, 2 × 80
mg of 3R, 90 mg of 4R, 150 mg of 5R, and 40 mg of 6R (preparative scale) in 100 μL
(analytical scale) or in 1000 μL of 1R, 2R, 3R, and 4R or 1500 μL
of 5R or 500 μL (preparative scale) of the mixtures
TFA/H2O/PhOH (95/2.5/2.5; v/v/v) (for 1–5) or TFA/PhOH/H2O/TIS (88/5/5/2; v/v/v/v) (for 6R) and keeping the reaction mixture at 60 °C under orbital
shaking for 2 h. Then, cold diisopropyl ether (800 μL or 5 mL)
was added for peptide precipitation, the resulting suspension was
centrifuged, and the supernatant was discharged, a procedure repeated
three times. Peptide extraction from the solid material was done by
adding 800 μL or 3 mL of solutions of 60% ACN/H2O containing 0.09% TFA, stirring, and centrifugation. The supernatant
was then removed, a procedure repeated twice. Finally, the supernatants
were pooled and lyophilized to give the crude peptide, which was weighted
and characterized.

Purification of Crude Peptides by RP-HPLC
Purifications
were performed on a system composed of an automatic gradient controller
(Waters 600 Controller), a quaternary pump (Waters Delta 600 Pump),
a UV detector (Waters 2487 Dual λ Absorbance), a manual sample
injector (Rheodyne 3725i-119), and a register (Kipp & Zonen recorder
124 SE) connected to a preparative C18 column (10 μm,
300 Å, 2.2 × 25.0 cm2, Vydac). The conditions
employed are listed in Table S1. The percentages
of ACN in solvents B and the linear gradients chosen are related to
the nature of the peptides analyzed.

Characterization of Crude
and Purified Peptides by RP-HPLC
All analyses were done using
a LDC system composed of an automatic
gradient controller, two pumps (LDC Analytical, a ConstaMetric 3500
and a ConstaMetric 3200 pump), a UV detector (LDC Analytical spectroMonitor
3100 detector), a manual sample injector (Rheodyne 7125), and an analytical
C18 column (5 μm, 300 Å, 0.46 × 25 cm2, Vydac). The software Clarity was used to register the chromatogram
obtained. The analytical conditions employed are listed in Table S1.

Characterization of Crude
and Purified Products 2–5 by LC-MS
Analyses
were performed on an on-line coupling
of a RP-HPLC system composed of two pumps (Shimadzu LC-10AD), an analytical
C18 column (5 μm, 300 Å, 0.46 × 25 cm2, Vydac), a detector (Shimadzu SDP-10 AV), and an injector
coupled to an electrospray (ESI) mass spectrometer with an ion-trap
detector (AmaZonX, Bruker Daltonics). The mass spectra were analyzed
with the help of HyStar 3.2 software. Analyses employed the same linear
gradient and solvent conditions as those used for analytical RP-HPLC.

Amino Acid Analysis
After full hydrolysis of purified
peptide conjugates by treatment with HCl 6 mol·L–1 at 110 °C for 24 h, amino acid analysis of the hydrolyzate was done using a Dionex BioLC
Chromatography system (Sunnyvale/CA) composed by an AS40 automatic
sampler, a GS50 quaternary pump, an LC25 column oven, a 2 × 250
mm2 PA10 AminoPac ion exchange column, and an ED50 electrochemical
detector. The amount of each amino acid detected was calculated from
comparative analyses using a mixture of 19 amino acids as a standard
at known concentrations.

Absorption and Emission Spectra of Free FAM,
Chk,
and Its Conjugates
Solutions (5 μmol·L–1) in 60% ACN/0.09% TFA/water of free FAM, free Chk, conjugates 3, 5, and 6 were prepared. Samples
were put in a cuvette, and absorption spectra (300–800 nm)
were recorded with the help of a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2401PC);
however, emission spectra were recorded in a Varian Eclipse Cary fluorescence
spectrophotometer. The excitation wavelengths were 492 nm for FAM
and conjugates and 410 nm for Chk and conjugates.

Evaluation
of Chk-PEG6-TAT(47-57)-NH2 Photosensitizing
Properties
Singlet oxygen generation
and detection were performed in an especially designed instrument
(Edinburgh F900) composed of a laser, cuvette holder, silicon filter,
monochromator (liquid-nitrogen-cooled), and a fast multiscaler analyzer
card with 5 ns/channel resolution. 1O2 emission spectra were obtained
by measuring emission intensities from 1200 to 1350 nm with 1.05 nm
steps. Lifetime measurements were performed by accumulation of ∼2000
decays in a time range of 80 μs. Emission spectra were automatically
recorded with the help of the instrument software by acquiring decays
at various wavelengths, accessing the maximum emission intensity in
each wavelength, and plotting the maximum intensity as a function
of the wavelength. The solutions of free Chk, 4, and 6 were prepared in a mixture of 60% ACN/H2O/0.09% TFA and diluted with it directly in the cuvette to
have an absorbance of ∼0.10, to be excited at 410 nm. All measurements
were performed at room temperature.

Photodegradation of FAM,
Chk, and Conjugates 3, 5, and 6
Absorption
spectra of solutions (10 μmol·L–1) of
Chk, FAM, and conjugates 3, 5, and 6 and pure Chk (∼8.5 μmol·L–1) in 60% ACN/H2O/0.09% TFA were obtained
with the help of a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2401PC) before and
after 5 min of laser irradiation (410 nm for Chk and conjugate 6, 440 nm for FAM and conjugates 3 and 5, pulses of 10 Hz) for 50 min, at room temperature. Then,
emission spectra were recorded by plotting the maximum absorbance
(at 410 nm for Chk and conjugate 6 and at
440 nm for FAM, conjugates, 3 and 5) as
a function of time.

Anticandidal Activity Assay
The
antifungal activity
was determined by the liquid growth-inhibition method based on the
Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) document M27-A2
and the method described by Bulet.82 The
strains (Candida parapsilosis, ATCC
22019) were cultured in Sabouraud Dextrose Agar for 24 h at 35 °C;
then, 4–5 colonies from it were collected and incubated in
Sabouraud Dextrose Broth at 35 °C overnight and then diluted
in fresh broth to have an Abs595nm ∼0.1 and incubated
again until the midlogarithmic phase is reached. This inoculum was
diluted in Potato Dextrose Broth (Abs595nm = 0.001) to
prepare the microplate for the assay. Amphotericin B was used as reference. The microplate
prepared was incubated at 35 °C under shaking for 24 h. Peptide
concentrations were in the range of 0.19–100 μmol·L–1. The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration
that causes total growth inhibition.

Effect of Light Irradiation
on the Anticandidal Activity
Because Chk is a
PS molecule, an extra assay for conjugate
6 was carried out similarly as described above but irradiating the
cells with light at 408 nm: after preparing the test plate, it was
left in the dark for 30 min to allow conjugate incorporation and then
irradiated by a led array (408 nm) for 40 min, to have a total light
dose of 10 J·cm–2. Finally, the plate was incubated
as described above.
