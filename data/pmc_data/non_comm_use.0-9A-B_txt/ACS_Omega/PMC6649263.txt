Cholinesterase, β-site
amyloid precursor protein cleaving
enzyme 1 (BACE1), and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β)
are the three main enzymes responsible for the early onset of Alzheimer’s
disease (AD). The main aim of the present study was to delineate and
accentuate the triple-inhibitory potential of arylbenzofurans from Morus alba against these enzymes. Overall, the enzyme
inhibition assays demonstrated the prominence of mulberrofuran D2
as an inhibitor of AChE, BChE, BACE1, and GSK-3β enzymes with
IC50 values of 4.61, 1.51, 0.73, and 6.36 μM, respectively.
Enzyme kinetics revealed different modes of inhibition, and in silico
modeling suggested that mulberrofuran D2 inhibited these enzymes with
low binding energy through hydrophilic, hydrophobic, and π–cation
interactions in the active site cavities. Similarly, in Aβ-aggregation
assays, mulberrofuran D2 inhibited self-induced and AChE-induced Aβ
aggregation in a concentration-dependent manner that was superior
to reference drugs. These results suggest that arylbenzofurans from M. alba, especially mulberrofuran D2, are triple
inhibitors of cholinesterase, BACE1, and GSK-3β and may represent
a novel class of anti-AD drugs.

Introduction
In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), cognition
progressively declines
due to neurodegeneration. AD affects the majority of elderly people
and thus has been regarded as the fourth leading cause of death worldwide.
Neuropathologically, AD is characterized by the formation of amyloid-β
peptide (Aβ) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), along with
the degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons.1 AD autopsy studies in the 1970s unveiled significant
losses of cholinergic cells in the basal forebrain and cholinergic
enzymes in the cortex. These findings, along with the well-known contribution
of the cholinergic system to memory and cognitive skills, led to the
“cholinergic hypothesis”, and since then, the cholinergic
neurotransmitter system has become known for its role in the cognitive
decline seen in AD.2

Additionally,
the deposition of amyloid protein via the amyloid
cascade leads to neurodegeneration and ultimately senile dementia,3 as described in the “amyloid hypothesis”.4 Under normal conditions, amyloid-β is cleaved
from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β- and γ-secretases
and is released outside the cell, where it is rapidly degraded. However,
under pathological conditions (e.g., a reduced metabolic ability to
degrade Aβ), Aβ peptides accumulate, contributing to Aβ
amyloid fibril formation. The assembly of Aβ amyloid fibrils
progresses to senile plagues, causing neurotoxicity and induced tau
pathology, thus triggering neuronal cell death.5

Another hypothesis is the “tau hypothesis”,
in which
tau protein is regarded as the principle causative agent of AD. Tau
is a microtubule-associated protein that regulates the stability of
tubulin. In AD, tau accumulates in neuronal cells in a hyperphosphorylated
state, forming what are commonly known as neurofibrillary tangles
(NFTs). This impairs the ability of tau to bind microtubules, which
reduces their stability and regulation,6 ultimately leading to tauopathy and cognitive decline.7

The three hypotheses on AD described above
have gained much attention,
and the treatment approaches for AD include the use of cholinesterase
(AChE and BChE) inhibitors, secretase (β- and γ-secretase)
inhibitors, and potential kinase inhibitors (for GSK-3β, CDK5
and MARK).8,9 Despite the long history of the cholinergic
and amyloid hypotheses, there have been disappointments during the
discovery and development of therapeutics for AD, due to failures
in different stages of clinical trials; thus, interest has shifted
toward the tau hypothesis. Nevertheless, regarding the former two
hypotheses, researchers have done their best to discover novel therapeutics
by natural or semisynthetic routes, so we have been gifted with several
novel dual inhibitors. Still, we researchers are not satisfied with
these discoveries and are thus focusing on triple inhibitors or multi-target-directed
ligands (MTDLs). Due to multifactorial etiology of AD and the fact
that there is no effective treatment till date besides drugs alleviating
associated symptoms, molecules designed to hit simultaneously different
key targets of the complex pathological network (known as MTDLs) emerge
as a more realistic alternative.10 Compared
to “one-molecule, one-target” with presumed selectivity
and inadequacy for multigenic diseases,11 discovery of multitarget small molecules that can modulate diverse
receptors or enzymatic systems in AD would lead to a new and more
efficient treatment approach.12,13 In addition, combination
therapy has issues of drug–drug interactions, off-target adverse
effects, poor patient compliance, and high development costs, and
MTDLs have inherent advantages over these issues.14 Herein, we continue our efforts to discover novel phytochemicals
from natural sources for the treatment of AD. We have evaluated the
triple-inhibitory potential of arylbenzofurans from Morus alba against cholinesterase, β-site amyloid
precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), and glycogen synthase
kinase-3β (GSK-3β), which address the three aforementioned
hypotheses.

Different parts of the M. alba Linn
plant, especially the root bark, leaves, fruit, and twigs, have been
used in traditional Chinese medicine as remedies for impaired vision,
hypertension, various metabolic disorders (e.g., diabetes), arthritis,
and fevers. Diverse groups of phytochemicals have been isolated from M. alba, including terpenoids, alkaloids, flavonoids
(such as anthocyanins and chalcones), phenolic acids, stilbenoids,
and coumarins.15 However, Diels–Alder-type
adducts (formed by the Diels–Alder reaction between the α,β-olefinic
moiety of a chalcone and an isoprene moiety) are the most representative
compounds of the genus Morus.16 Many of these compounds exhibit various biological activities,
including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antimicrobial,
antitumor, antihypotensive, antidiabetic, and anti-Alzheimer’s
disease activity.16−19 In our recent study on the root bark of M. alba, we discovered moracin derivatives that functioned as dual inhibitors
of BACE1 and cholinesterase.20 Similarly,
in a recent study by Xia et al.,21 10 Diels–Alder-type
adducts, which are abundant in M. alba, have been characterized as multitargeted agents for Alzheimer’s
disease. Besides Diels–Alder-type adducts, 2-arylbenzofurans
represent the other group of active phytochemicals that are commonly
substituted by prenyl and geranyl groups at different positions. Numerous
studies have suggested an important role of prenyl and geranyl groups
in enzyme inhibition.22 In addition, it
was reported that the prenyl, geranyl, and/or farnesyl group increase
cellular permeability.23 Therefore, 2-arylbenzofurans
substituted by prenyl, geranyl and/or farnesyl group at different
positions could be promising targets in neurodegenerative diseases.
Thus, in the present study, we have evaluated the triple-inhibitory
potential of arylbenzofurans from M. alba (Figure 1), having
prenyl, geranyl, and/or farnesyl group at different positions, against
cholinesterase, BACE1, and GSK-3β.

Results
Inhibition of Multiple
Enzyme Targets by Arylbenzofurans
The structures of the arylbenzofurans
isolated from the root bark
of M. alba Linn are shown in Figure 1. The potential of
each compound to inhibit the tested enzymes by 50% is listed in Table 1. As shown in the
table, 1, 2 and 4 strongly
inhibited AChE. Among them, 2 was the most potent, with
an IC50 value of 4.61 ± 0.08 μM, followed by 4 (IC50, 13.92 ± 1.98 μM) and 1 (IC50, 23.05 ± 1.15 μM). Interestingly, 3 and 5 did not have observable effects. However,
for BChE inhibition, all of the test compounds except 4 were active. Again, with the lowest IC50 value (1.51
± 0.09 μM), 2 was a stronger inhibitor than
the other compounds against BChE. The IC50 values for 1, 3, and 5 were 6.12, 64.51, and
19.14 μM, respectively. Comparing the inhibitory activities
of the compounds against the cholinesterases, 4 was selective
toward AChE, 3 and 5 were selective toward
BChE, and 1 and 2 exhibited dual inhibition,
although 2 had multifold higher activity than that of 1 and was the most potent compound overall.

d Inhibition constants at constant
adenosine 5-triphosphate (ATP) and substrate concentrations, respectively.

The BACE1 inhibition results
demonstrated that all of the test
compounds were potent at low micromolar concentrations. With a submicromolar
IC50 value (0.73 ± 0.03 μM), 2 was
the most active, followed by 3 (1.04 ± 0.78 μM), 4 (2.03 ± 0.34 μM), 1 (3.74 ±
1.01 μM), and 5 (5.64 ± 0.27 μM). Compounds 2–4 had better activity than the reference
drug quercetin (IC50, 3.38 ± 0.05 μM). Similarly,
the IC50 values of 1–5 against GSK-3β were less than 10 μM, indicating that
these compounds were potent inhibitors of this enzyme. Luteolin was
used as a natural reference drug, as it has been reported to be a
potent inhibitor of GSK-3β.24 Upon
review of the inhibition patterns of 1–5 against the tested enzymes, 1 and 2 were
found to be triple inhibitors of cholinesterase, BACE1, and GSK-3β,
with 2 being the more active compound, having lower IC50 values than those of 1 for all of the enzymes.

Enzyme Kinetics of Arylbenzofurans
To determine the
enzyme inhibition mechanisms, we analyzed the enzyme kinetics of the
respective enzymes at different substrate concentrations. Based on
the IC50 values of enzyme inhibition, the inhibition mode and enzyme kinetic
parameters of 2 were investigated via Lineweaver–Burk
plots and Dixon plots (Table 1 and Figures 2 and 3). The kinetic results of enzyme inhibition
revealed that 2 was a noncompetitive inhibitor of AChE
and BACE1, with Ki values of 1.40 and
0.45 μM, respectively. For BChE inhibition, 2 exhibited
a mixed-type inhibition mode, with a Ki value of 0.78 μM. In the noncompetitive mode of enzyme inhibition
(Figure 2D,F), the Vmax value increases in a dose-dependent manner
without changing the Km value. In the
case of BChE inhibition (Figure 2E), the plots of 1/V versus 1/[S] produced a family of straight lines with a common intercept
in the second quadrant, indicating mixed-type inhibition.

and Lineweaver–Burk plots for AChE (A, D), BChE

D2.

Figure 3 Dixon and Lineweaver–Burk plots for GSK-3β
inhibition
by mulberrofuran D2, (A, C) at constant ATP and (B, D) at constant
GSM substrate, respectively.

To determine the mechanism of GSK-3β enzyme inhibition,
we
assessed the ability of 2 to competitively replace ATP
and the substrate GSM (Figure 3). Under the conditions of either a constant substrate (25
μM) or a constant ATP (1 μM) concentration, the Lineweaver–Burk
plots revealed that all of the lines intersected at the same point
on the y-axis (Figure 3C,D), suggesting that Km increased with increasing concentrations of 2, while
1/Vmax did not change. The data demonstrated
that 2 competed with both the substrate and ATP at their
respective binding sites, with Ki values
of 3.09 and 5.54 μM, respectively.

In Silico Molecular Docking
Simulation of Enzyme Inhibition
Compound 2,
the triple inhibitor of cholinesterase,
BACE1, and GSK-3β, was selected for further molecular docking
simulations, due to its high inhibitory activity against these enzymes
(Figures 4–6). Tables 2 and 3 display the binding energies
of 2 and the reference compounds in the active site cavities
of the respective enzymes, along with various interacting residues.
As shown, 2 bound to the active site cavity of AChE (PDB
code 1EVE) with
lower binding energy than the reference compounds (−11.66 kcal/mol)
by forming hydrophobic bonds with Trp84, Tyr334, and Trp279 and an
H-bond with Tyr121 (Figure 4A–C). These are prime interacting residues at the peripheral
anionic site (PAS) responsible for allosteric inhibition. Besides
this, other hydrophobic interactions with Tyr70, Phe330, and His440
were observed, which probably stabilize 2 within the
binding cavity. Compared to the noncompetitive reference inhibitor
donepezil, 2 displayed two additional H-bond interacting
residues (Arg289 and Tyr121), in addition to a common residue (Phe288).

and allosteric inhibition, respectively.

c Binding poses of mulberrofuran D2

Similarly, 2 exhibited
mixed-type inhibition of BChE
(PDB code 4BDS), with a low binding energy (−10.12 kcal/mol) that was similar
to that of the reference allosteric inhibitor 5i (1-[2-(2,4-Dichlorophenyl)-2-phenylmethoxyethyl]imidazole)25 but lower than that of the reference catalytic
inhibitor tacrine. The H-bond interacting residues included Gln67,
Asp70, Asn68, and His438, while the major hydrophobic residues responsible
for BChE inhibition by 2 were Trp82, Ala328, Pro84, Pro285,
Met437, Phe329, Tyr440, and Tyr332 (Figure 4D–F).

X-ray crystallography
has been used to determine the structures
of numerous BACE1 complexes, and we employed 2WJO for our docking
study (Figure 5). As
shown in Table 2, QUD
was used as a reference catalytic inhibitor of BACE1, while sinensetin
was used as an allosteric inhibitor.26 Bridging
with three H-bond interacting residues (Asn37, Ser36, and Tyr198), 2 bound to the active allosteric site of BACE1 with very low
energy (−10.06 kcal/mol). The other hydrophobic interacting
residues (Val69, Tyr71, Trp76, Phe108, Tyr198, and Ile126) enhanced
the binding affinity by increasing stability.

mulberrofuran D2 are shown as red, blue, and green sticks, respectively.
Closeup of the mulberrofuran D2 binding pose in the active site of
BACE1 (B, C).

Similarly, for GSK-3β
enzyme inhibition (Table 3), 2 formed H-bonds
with Gln89, Asp90, and Lys94 within the substrate pocket, with lower
binding energy (−9.87 kcal/mol) than that of the reference
substrate-competitive inhibitor andrographolide (−8.17 kcal/mol).
Other hydrophobic interacting residues that helped to stabilize ligand 2 within this pocket were Arg96 and Pro294, similar to the
reference inhibitor (Figure 6). Additionally, in the ATP-binding pocket,
the major H-bond interaction involved Asp133 and Val135 residues,
which are prime interacting residues for ATP-competitive inhibitors.
Furthermore, the aromatic ring exhibited a π–cation interaction
with MG1002, which accounted for the higher binding affinity of 2 (−9.78 kcal/mol) than that of the ATP-competitive
reference inhibitor phosphoaminophosphonic acid–adenylate ester
(AMP–PNP). Ala83, Leu188, and Val70 stabilized ligand 2 within the ATP-binding pocket in a similar manner to the
reference inhibitor. Overall, the docking study revealed that ligand 2 bound to the active site cavity of each enzyme with lower
energy and higher binding affinity than those of the reference inhibitors.

Effects on the Aβ
Aggregation
Since 2 showed the highest potency
for AChE inhibition, it was selected
to assess its ability to inhibit self-induced and AChE-induced amyloid-β
aggregations. As shown in Figure 7, 2 showed moderate effect on self-induced
Aβ1–42 aggregation inhibition, which was concentration-dependent.
At 20 μM concentration, 2 inhibited the self-induced
Aβ1–42 aggregations by 60%. Curcumin was used
as a reference drug, which inhibited the aggregation by 43% at 20
μM. Similarly, in the AChE-induced amyloid aggregation assay, 2 inhibited the Aβ1–40 aggregations
by 83% at 20 μM. Donepezil was used as a reference drug, which
inhibited AChE-induced amyloid aggregation by 35% at 50 μM concentration.
Activity of 2 even at 10 μM concentration was better
than that of reference compounds in Aβ aggregation assays.

Druglikeness was predicted for all of the
tested 2-arylbenzofuran derivatives. The results suggested that these
compounds have good druglike properties, as they adhered to the MDDR-like
rule and Lipinski’s rule (Table 4). However, in the case of 4, though it
exhibited druglike properties according to the MDDR-like rule,27 it did not obey Lipinski’s rule.28

and log P (≤5). MDDR-like rule: the
MDDR-like rule describes a molecule as druglike or non-drug-like on
the basis of the number of rings, rigid bonds, and rotatable bonds.

The ADME prediction results
of these compounds revealed an excellent
percentage of plasma protein binding (100%), a high percentage of
human intestinal absorption (HIA) (>90%), and good lipophilicity
(log Po/w value range of 4.74–10.66)
(Table 4). The blood–brain
barrier (BBB) penetration values ([brain]/[blood]) were >10%, except
for 3 (1.01%). Since human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma
cells (Caco-2) and Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells are
commonly used to assess intestinal permeability in early drug discovery
in vitro, we used these cell models to predict the permeability of
our test compounds. The compounds exhibited low permeation across
MDCK cells but medium permeation across Caco-2 cells, except for 3, which exhibited a low value. All of these predicted results
will be helpful for the optimization of druglike properties.

Discussion
The most common form of neurodegenerative disease is Alzheimer’s
disease. It is characterized by amyloid-β and tau protein deposition.
Various proteases, α-, β-, γ-, and δ-secretases,
have been reported to be involved in APP cleavage via either amyloidogenic
or nonamyloidogenic pathways.29,30 However, β-secretase
mediates the initial and rate-limiting process of Aβ generation.
Monomeric and oligomeric forms of this protein in the brain parenchyma
aggregate through a nucleation-dependent cascade, forming mature β-sheet-rich
protein structures called amyloid fibrils. These amyloid fibrils stack
upon one another and form conserved amyloid, propagating the pathology
and neurotoxicity. Hence, inhibitors of β-secretase prevent
amyloidogenesis. Our results revealed five arylbenzofurans with potent
inhibitory activity against BACE1 at low micromolar concentrations.
Test compounds 2–5 were more potent
than the reference compound berberine. Interestingly, 2 exhibited the most prominent activity against BACE1, with an IC50 value <1 μM. Enzyme kinetics and molecular docking
studies revealed 2 as a competitive inhibitor with lower
binding energy than that of the reference compounds. To validate our
docking results, we used QUD, a potent catalytic inhibitor of BACE1,
as a reference.

The cholinergic system is the most important
neurotransmitter system
involved in learning and memory. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) hydrolyzes
acetylcholine (ACh) to choline and acetate, while butyrylcholinesterase
(BChE) acts as a coregulator of AChE activity. These esterases also
have nonenzymatic functions associated with Aβ aggregation and
NFT formation in the AD brains of mice and humans.31,32 Our cholinesterase inhibition assays demonstrated that three compounds
were active against AChE and four were active against BChE. Among
them, 1 and 2 were active against both cholinesterases,
but 2 was a stronger inhibitor, as its IC50 value was one-fifth that of 1.

Insight into various
essential structural elements and modes of
ACh processing can be obtained from the X-ray structures of AChE cocrystalized
with its ligands. The presence of a narrow but long hydrophobic gorge,
20 Å deep inside, with a catalytic triad consisting of Glu334,
His447, and Ser203, is an astounding structural feature of AChE.33 In addition, a peripheral anionic site (PAS),
which comprises the other set of aromatic residues (namely, Asp74,
Tyr72, Tyr124, Tyr286, and Tyr341) at the rim of the gorge, provides
a binding site for allosteric inhibition.34 So far, two mechanisms of AChE inhibition have been proposed, besides
an exceptional case of backdoor inhibition, in which inhibitors induce
a conformational change in Trp86 at the catalytic triad at a depth
of 20 Å and interfere with the opening and closing of the product-releasing
channel.35 The two well-explained AChE
inhibition mechanisms are as follows: (a) competitive inhibition via
interaction with the catalytic triad inside the gorge at a depth of
20 Å and (b) allosteric inhibition via π–cation
or π–π interactions with PAS, thus blocking the
entry of the substrate into the gorge or preventing the exit of products.36

In our docking study of AChE, 2 exhibited hydrophobic
interactions with Tyr70, Trp279, Trp84, Phe330, Tyr334, and His440
and H-bond interactions with Phe288, Arg289, and Tyr121. Trp84 is
the main binding residue of the catalytic anionic site in the vicinity
of the catalytic triad, while Tyr70, Tyr121, Tyr334, and Trp279 are
the main peripheral anionic sites at the gorge rim.37 Thus, from our kinetics and docking results, we can conclude
that 2 allosterically inhibited AChE through hydrophobic
interactions with Tyr70, Tyr121, Trp84, Tyr334, and Trp279, while
other residues stabilized this inhibitor at the binding site. The
two extra H-bond interacting residues of 2 (Arg289 and
Tyr121) in addition to the common residue Phe288 might explain why 2 had a higher binding affinity than that of the reference
inhibitor donepezil.

Similarly, at the BChE active site, 2 bound with Tyr332
within the anionic hinge that prevents choline from entering the enzyme
cavity. A recent study by Murakawa et al.38 revealed that Phe329 is a common binding site for active BChE inhibitors.
The authors also described that Asp70 in the hinge and Gly116 within
the oxyanion cavity form another active site for BChE where inhibitors
may bind. Our docking results also revealed hydrophobic interactions
of 2 with Phe329 and Asp70.

The cholinesterases
AChE and BChE share 65% amino acid sequence
homology but differ in their substrate specificity and susceptibility
to various inhibitors. The anionic site of AChE, comprising Trp84,
Tyr130, Phe330, and Phe331, is responsible for substrate binding with
π–cation interactions. However, in BChE, the key tryptophan
residue (Trp82) is conserved, while Phe330 is replaced by Ala328.
Thus, inhibitors that interact strongly with Phe330 have a higher
affinity for AChE than for BChE, due to the replacement of Phe330
by Ala328 in the latter.39 However, in
our study, 2 interacted with Phe330 at the anionic site
of AChE and with Ala328 in BChE and was further stabilized by other
hydrophobic interactions, thereby demonstrating itself as a potent
allosteric inhibitor of both cholinesterases.

Among various
secretases, β-secretase is a prime enzyme catalyzing
the rate-limiting step in the production of Aβ, a principal
pathological component of AD. Although all of the tested arylbenzofurans
were potent inhibitors of BACE1, we further evaluated 2 for its enzyme kinetics and mechanism via in silico docking, considering
its submicromolar IC50 value. The numerous H-bond interacting
residues and the low binding energy of 2 demonstrated
its high binding affinity for the active site cavity. Various X-ray
crystallography studies have revealed the structures of numerous BACE1
complexes,40−42 indicating that BACE1 is covered by a flexible antiparallel
β-hairpin (flap) that controls substrate access to the active
site and determines the geometry of the catalytic process; the inhibitor-bound
form is tightly packed in a closed conformation. However, the apo
(substrate-free) structure of BACE1 is in an open conformation, indicating
the necessity of a conformational change upon inhibitor or substrate
binding.43

Ligand 2 exhibited
hydrophobic interactions with allosteric
residues Val69, Tyr71, Trp76, Phe108, and Ile126 of BACE1, without
involving the catalytic dyad. A study by Kumar et al.44 revealed that a catalytic Asp dyad is responsible for the
cleavage of APP by an acid–base mechanism. Since BACE1 is a
membrane-bound aspartyl protease with a catalytic Asp dyad, direct
inhibition via these aspartyl residues (Asp32 and Asp228) may have
deleterious effects.45 This emphasizes
the need to discover allosteric inhibitors that bind to regions other
than the conserved active site of BACE1. Ligand 2 formed
a dual hydrophobic and hydrophilic interaction with the allosteric
Tyr198 residue of the enzyme. This accumulation of evidence, together
with the allosteric inhibition of BACE1 by 2 through
allosteric residues Asn37, Tyr198, Trp76, Val69, and Phe108, demonstrates
the mechanism whereby 2 prevented APP cleavage. The additional
interactions of 2 with Ser36 and Tyr71 enhanced its binding
affinity and stability compared to those of sinensetin, the reference
allosteric inhibitor.

The other important and emerging hypothesis
besides the cholinergic
and amyloid hypotheses is the tau or GSK-3 hypothesis of AD. According
to this hypothesis, enhanced Aβ production and memory impairment
are due to the overexpression of GSK-3. GSK-3 is a kinase protein
and a promising drug target in AD, due to its pathophysiological involvement
in tau protein phosphorylation or hyperphosphorylation. The inhibition
of GSK-3 prevents neuronal destruction resulting from tau pathology
in AD. In the present study, all of the tested arylbenzofurans potently
inhibited GSK-3β, with 50% inhibitory concentrations less than
10 μM. Although 1 and 4 were stronger
inhibitors of GSK-3β, 2 was selected for enzyme
inhibition and molecular modeling studies, as it had the lowest IC50 values against the cholinesterase and BACE1 enzymes. In
GSK-3β enzyme kinetics studies, 2 competed with
both the substrate and ATP and was characterized as a competitive
inhibitor. An X-ray crystallographic structure of GSK-3β (PDB
ID: 1PYX) was
selected to take into consideration the potential induced-fit effects
upon ligand binding, as this structure corresponds to the native enzyme
for substrate recognition.24 The docking
results of 1PYX demonstrated that −OH groups of 2 formed H-bonds with GSK-3β residues Gln89, Asp90, and Lys94
within the substrate pocket. Similarly, within the ATP-binding site,
the two −OH groups established H-bond interactions with Asp133
and Val135 and an aromatic ring formed a π–cation interaction
with MG1002. These residues were previously reported as backbone residues
for ATP-competitive inhibitors of GSK-3β.46 In Aβ-aggregation assays employing the ThT fluorescence
method, 2 showed a concentration-dependent inhibition
of self-induced and AChE-induced aggregation of Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 superior to reference controls.
Since AChE promotes aggregation of Aβ-peptide fragments by forming
a complex with the growing fibrils,47 inhibitory
effect of 2 on Aβ-aggregation represents a preventive
action on senile plaque formation.

Despite the fact that AD
is a progressive neurodegenerative disease,
there is no clinically accepted therapy to cure it. The US Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) has approved drugs (donepezil, galantamine,
memantine, and rivastigmine) that at their best provide only marginal
benefits, thus demonstrating the urgent need to explore other molecular
entities as future drug candidates for AD. A closeup view of the molecular
framework of these FDA-approved drugs indicates that most of them
have heterocyclic ring systems, highlighting the potential of heterocyclic
compounds as potent drug candidates. Likewise, heterocyclic compounds
have been evaluated for the treatment of neurological and psychological
disorders and benzofurans and indole derivatives have been suggested
for the treatment of AD.48 In support of
this, our ADME and druglikeness prediction results demonstrated that
the compounds we tested were druglike molecules with excellent human
intestinal absorption (>90%) and 100% plasma protein binding. Thus,
these arylbenzofuran scaffolds from the root bark of M. alba Linn, especially 2, could be
promising drug candidates in the management of AD. However, detailed
in vivo studies will be of the utmost importance to support our findings.
Similarly, in recent studies by Zhang et al.,29 δ-secretase was found to cleave APP and regulate the pathogenesis
of AD, and its inhibition improved cognitive function in mouse models
of AD. Thus, it would be worth examining the effects of these compounds
on δ-secretase.

In the present study, we identified and
characterized arylbenzofurans
(1–5) from M. alba Linn as triple inhibitors of cholinesterase, BACE1, and GSK-3β
by in vitro enzyme kinetics assays and in silico molecular simulations.
The triple inhibition mode of this class of compounds, especially 2, explains their multiple-targeting properties. Due to their
unique inhibition mechanism, these compounds have specific advantages
over the reported single and/or dual inhibitors, and the results of
ADME and druglikeness predictions further support the possibility
of drug development. Still, in vivo studies remain to be conducted.

Isolation of Compounds
A MeOH extract (1.2 kg) of the
root bark of M. alba Linn was suspended
in distilled water (H2O) and successively partitioned with n-hexane, CH2Cl2, and EtOAc. The CH2Cl2 fraction (215.2 g) was then subjected to silica
gel CC and eluted with a gradient of 0–100% MeOH in CHCl3 to afford 15 fractions (F1–F15). Fraction F2 (5.5
g) was chromatographed by silica gel CC with n-hexane–acetone
(100:0 to 0:100, gradient, v/v) as the eluent to afford 10 subfractions
(F2.1–F2.10). Subfraction F2.7 (225 mg) was passed over a silica

based
on the proton and carbon NMR spectra.

Cholinesterase Enzyme Inhibition
Assay
The in vitro
ChE-inhibitory potential of the arylbenzofurans isolated from the
root bark of M. alba Linn was determined
through our previously reported procedure.51 ACh and BCh were used as substrates to examine the inhibition of
AChE and BChE, respectively. The test samples and the positive control
(berberine) were each dissolved in 10% analytical-grade DMSO. The
reactions were conducted in triplicate in a 96-well microplate. A
VersaMax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) was
employed to monitor the hydrolysis of ACh or BCh at 412 nm. The percent
inhibition of ChE was calculated as (1 – S/E) × 100, where S and E are the enzyme activities in the presence or absence of
inhibitors, respectively. The IC50 values were calculated
from the log dose–inhibition curve.

BACE1 Enzyme Inhibition
Assay
Inhibition of the BACE1
enzyme was evaluated in vitro with human recombinant β-secretase
and a BACE1 fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay kit.
All of the experimental conditions and procedures were similar to
those in our previous report.52 Quercetin
was used as a reference control. The percent (%) inhibition of BACE1
was calculated from the following equation: % inhibition = [1 –
(A60 – A0)/(C60 – C0)] × 100%, where A0 and C0 are the initial fluorescences of the test
and control samples, respectively, and A60 and C60 are the final (after 60 min)
fluorescences of the test and control samples, respectively. The IC50 values were calculated from the log dose–inhibition
curve.

GSK-3β Enzyme Inhibition Assay
The inhibition
of the GSK-3β enzyme was evaluated in vitro with hGSK-3β
and a Kinase-Glo reagent kit. The procedure reported by Baki et al.53 was used, with some modifications.54 To initiate the reaction, 5 μL of the
sample, 5 μL of ATP (1 μM final concentration), 5 μL
of 50 μM GSM and 5 μL of 20 ng GSK-3β were mixed per well in a 384-well black plate. The
test samples were serially diluted in an assay buffer containing 50
mM HEPES, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, and 15 mM magnesium acetate at pH
7.5. The final concentration of DMSO in each reaction mixture was
less than 5%. The reaction mixture was then incubated at 37 °C
for 30 min, followed by the addition of 20 μL of the Kinase-Glo
reagent as a stop solution. Once the reaction was terminated, glow-type
luminescence was recorded. The method was validated with luteolin
as a reference compound causing maximum inhibition, and the maximum
enzyme activity was determined in the absence of inhibitors (5 μL
of sample replaced by 5 μL of buffer).

Enzyme Kinetics
The assay method described in the enzyme
inhibition section was used to evaluate the kinetics of AChE inhibition
by mulberrofuran D2 (2.5, 5, and 10 μM) in the presence of varying
concentrations of ACh (0.15, 0.3, and 0.6 nM). For BChE enzyme kinetics,
mulberrofuran D2 was used at concentrations of 0.2, 1, and 5 μM,
with different concentrations of BCh (0.3, 0.6, and 0.9 nM). Similarly,
mulberrofuran D2 (0.5, 1, and 2 μM) was reacted with different
substrate concentrations (250, 375, and 750 nM) following the assay
method for BACE1 enzyme inhibition described above. The assay method
in the enzyme inhibition section was used to evaluate the enzyme kinetics
of GSK-3β with varying concentrations of ATP (2, 1, and 0.5
μM) or substrate (50, 25, and 12.5 μM). Mulberrofuran
D2 was used at concentrations of 2.5, 5, and 10 μM. The double
reciprocal plots of the enzyme kinetic data were used to derive a
Lineweaver–Burk plot. Ki values
were calculated from the Dixon plots.

Docking Studies
Molecular docking analysis was carried
out in AutoDock 4.2.55 X-ray crystallographic
structures of AChE–donepezil (PDB ID: 1EVE),56 BChE–tacrine (PDB ID: 4BDS),57 and BACE1–QUD
(PDB ID: 2WJO)58 complexes were obtained from the RCSB
Protein Data Bank (PDB) website (http://www.rcsb.org/) at resolutions of 2.50, 2.10, and 2.50
Å, respectively. The X-ray crystallographic structure of human
GSK-3β complexed with a known ATP-competitive inhibitor, phosphoaminophosphonic
acid–adenylate ester (AMP–PNP), was obtained from the
RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 1PYX) at a resolution of 2.4 Å.59 Rotatable bonds in the inhibitors and positive
controls were assigned by AutoDockTools (ADT). The structures of mulberrofuran
D2, 1-[2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-phenylmethoxyethyl]imidazole (5i),
and N′-dodecanoyl-1-ethyl-4-hydroxy-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline-3-carbohydrazide
(VP0.7) were created in Chem3D Pro software (v12.0, CambridgeSoft
Inc., Cambridge, MA). The structures of galantamine, sinensetin, and
andrographolide were obtained from NCBI PubChem, with the respective
CIDs of 9651, 145659, and 5318517. Energy minimization was carried
out for each ligand by means of a molecular mechanics 2 (MM2) force
field. AutoDock 4.2 was used for docking simulations, and grid maps
that included the catalytic site and allosteric site were generated
in the AutoGrid program. The protocol for rigid and flexible ligand
docking comprised 15 independent genetic algorithms. Docking results
were visualized and analyzed with PyMOL (v1.7.4, Schrödinger,
LLC, Cambridge, MA) and Discovery Studio (v17.1, Accelrys, San Diego,
CA).

Self-Induced Aβ1–42 Aggregation Inhibition
Assay
Mulberrofuran D2, which showed the highest potency
for AChE inhibition, was selected to assess its ability to inhibit
self-induced Aβ1–42 aggregations via the thioflavin
T (ThT) fluorescence method.60 Briefly,
Aβ1–42 lyophilized from 2 mg/mL hexafluoro-2-propanol
(HFIP) solution was dissolved in DMSO to obtain 0.5 mM stock solution.
Then, the stock solution of Aβ1–42 was diluted
by 10-fold in 0.05 M phosphate buffer solution containing 0.1 M NaCl
(pH 7.5). To 30 μL of the amyloid solution, 30 μL of different
concentrations of mulberrofuran D2 (5, 10, and 20 μM) and/or
curcumin (20 μM) was added. After 24 h incubation at 37 °C,
240 μL of a 5 μM thioflavin T in 50 mM glycine–NaOH
buffer (pH 8.5) was added, and after 5 min, the fluorescence emission
at 490 nm (ex = 446 nm) was measured. The fluorescence intensities
were compared and the percent inhibition due to the presence of the
inhibitor was calculated by the following formula: 100 – (Fi/Fc × 100),
where Fi and Fc are the fluorescence intensities obtained for Aβ1–42 in the presence and in the absence of inhibitors, respectively.

AChE-Induced Aβ1–40 Aggregation Inhibition
Assay
For the AChE-induced Aβ1–40 aggregation inhibition assay, aliquots of 2 μL of Aβ1–40 were incubated for 24 h at room temperature in
0.215 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) at a final concentration
of 230 μM. For coincubation experiments, 16 μL of AChE
(final concentration of 2.3 μM, Aβ1–40/AChE molar ratio of 100:1) and AChE in the presence of 2 μL
of the tested inhibitor (final concentration 5, 10, and 20 μM)
in 0.215 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) solutions were added.
Blanks containing Aβ1–40 alone, human AChE
alone, and Aβ1–40 plus tested inhibitors in
0.215 sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) were prepared. After incubation,
180 μL of 5 μM thioflavin T in 50 mM glycine–NaOH
buffer (pH 8.5) was added. Each assay was run in triplicate, and donepezil
was used as a reference drug. The detection method was the same as
above.

Druglikeness and ADME Prediction
Druglikeness predictions
were carried out with PreADMET. This web-based server can be used
to calculate absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME)
data and build a druglikeness library in silico.

Statistical
Analysis
All of the results are presented
as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) of triplicate experiments.
One-way analysis of variance and Duncan’s test (v23.0, Systat
Inc., Evanston, IL) were used to calculate the statistical significance.
A p-value <0.05 was considered significant.
