Near-infrared (NIR)
absorbing nanomaterials, built from anionic
heptamethine cyanine dyes and single-walled carbon nanotubes or few-layer
graphene, are presented. The covalent linkage, using 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition
reactions, results in nanoconjugates that synchronize the properties
of both materials, as demonstrated by an in-depth characterization
study carried out by transmission electron microscopy, atomic force
microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. UV–vis–NIR
and Raman spectroscopies further confirmed the unique electronic structure
of the novel photoactive nanomaterials.

Introduction
The field of carbon
nanostructures has attracted tremendous research
interest over the last few years because of the fascinating properties
and potential applications of these materials, which have stimulated
scientists of different areas of knowledge.1 In particular, fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, and graphene have become
extraordinarily popular nanomaterials because of their unique mechanical,
electronic, and thermal properties.2 However,
it is often desirable to further modify their properties, and, in
this sense, the use of a great variety of chemical methodologies has
allowed the fine-tuning of carbon nanomaterial performance.3

The chemical modification of carbon nanotubes
and graphene is critical
to improve their processability for any practical application. Functionalization
schemes that confer an additional element of control over the nanomaterial
properties are particularly attractive, and, in this regard, the combination
of carbon nanostructures with photo- and electroactive molecules or
polymers attracts considerable attention for their potential as electron-donor/-acceptor
systems for artificial photosynthesis,4 in photovoltaics,5 or as optical sensors.6

Interactions of carbon nanotubes and graphene
with several photo-
and electroactive molecules/macromolecules that operate in ultraviolet/visible
regions of the spectrum, such as anthracene,7 pyrene,8 tetrathiafulvalenes,9 polymers,10 and other
chromophores,11 have been studied. However,
the near-infrared (NIR) region, which constitutes a significant portion
of the solar spectrum, is very promising for fluorescence detection
and imaging and has been largely unexplored. In this regard, only
a few examples combine carbon nanotubes and graphene with quantum
dots12 and metalomacrocycles such as porphyrins
and phthalocyanines.13 In particular, porphyrins
are characterized by remarkably high extinction coefficients and tailor-made
carbon nanohybrids endowed with porphyrins offer valuable new systems
in the field of nano-optoelectronic devices for energy conversion,
sensing, and biological applications.14

Anionic heptamethine cyanines represent another interesting
class
of ionic light harvester dyes showing an intense NIR absorption that
spans from 750 to 900 nm.15 Stimulated
by the aforementioned results on porphyrinoid systems, we succeeded
in preparing heptamethine cyanine molecular nanoconjugates 1–3 as NIR light harvesters in donor–acceptor
systems (Figure 1).16−18 Here, we extend the methodology effectively used in the functionalization
of [60] and [70]fullerenes16 with heptamethine
cyanines to single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and few-layer
graphene (FLG) in an effort to increase the light-absorption capabilities
of these carbon nanomaterials in the NIR region.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis of Cyanine-Based Nanomaterials
The synthesis
of the SWCNT–cyanine (5) and FLG–cyanine
(6) nanoconjugates is described in Scheme 1. Formylcyanine 4 was obtained
following a previously reported procedure16a and subsequently used in the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction19 with SWCNTs or FLG, and N-octylglycine—amino
acid selected in an attempt to increase the solubility of these nanocarbons.
The commercial SWCNTs were used without any treatment in the reaction,
whereas FLG was obtained through graphite exfoliation in ortho-dichlorobenzene (oDCB) following Coleman’s
procedure.20 Such a FLG suspension in oDCB was immediately reacted.

Scheme 1 Synthetic Approach
Used for the Preparation of Carbon Nanomaterials 5 and 6
The 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition
reaction was carried out under microwave
irradiation in a closed quartz tube at 160 °C. After cooling
to room temperature, the solid was washed by filtration over a 0.2
μm poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) membrane several times with oDCB, CH2Cl2, and MeOH (sonicated,
centrifuged, and filtered) until the filtrate solution remained colorless,
thus affording functionalized nanocarbons 5 and 6.

The obtained nanoconjugates were studied by a number
of characterization
techniques, including thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron
microscopy (TEM), and UV–vis–NIR spectroscopy, to obtain
fully detailed information about the structural, electronic, and chemical
properties of the functionalized SWCNTs and FLG.

Structural
Characterization
A first indication of the
covalent attachment of the heptamethine cyanine to SWCNTs and FLG
was obtained from TGA under an inert atmosphere (Figures 2 and S1, respectively). As anticipated, considering the different curvature
and reactivity of the carbon nanostructures investigated,21 a slightly higher degree of functionalization
was observed for SWCNTs (34%) as compared to that for FLG (31%) considering
the mass loss of the materials at 650 °C. From this data, we
estimated 1 functional group per 140 carbon atoms in the case of nanoconjugate 5 and 1 functional group per 171 carbon atoms in the case
of nanoconjugate 6. As expected, 5 and 6 maintain the decomposition pattern of the heptamethine cyanine,
although with a small increase of the temperature decomposition maxima
(see derivate curves in Figures 2 and S1), which indicates
a thermal stabilization of the whole system due to the covalent linkage
of heptamethine cyanine to SWCNTs or FLG.

Figure 2 TGA analysis and first
derivate curves of 5 (blue), 4 (green),
and HiPco SWCNTs (black), recorded under nitrogen
atmosphere.

Additional support of
the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction taking
place on SWCNTs and FLG was obtained by FTIR (Figures 3 and S2). The
appearance of the stretching vibrations of the cyano groups at 2221
cm–1 for 5 and at 2218 cm–1 for 6 corroborates the existence of these groups on
the surfaces of the nanoconjugates formed. Furthermore, the existence
of other characteristic bands of heptamethine cyanine, such as those
at ca. 1100–1096 cm–1, confirms the presence
of heptamethine cyanine molecules in nanomaterials 5 and 6.

Figure 3 FTIR spectra of 6 (blue) relative to 4 (green) and FLG (black).

XPS provided a semiquantitative analysis of the elements
found
on the surface of 5 and 6, giving, in addition,
information about the relative abundance of those elements within
the material surface (Figures 4 and S3).22 Interestingly, in the XPS survey of nanocarbons 5 and 6, in addition to the core-level contributions of C 1s at
284.6 eV and O 1s at 532.6 eV, photoelectrons collected from the N
1s core level are also observed at 399.5 eV.

Figure 4 XPS analysis of FLG–cyanine
nanoconjugates 6. The inserts show the C 1s and N 1s
core-level spectra deconvolution.

The XPS C 1s core-level spectrum of 6 can be
deconvoluted
into five peak components with binding energies of 284.4, 285.1, 285.8,
287.2, and 289.5 eV, which, similar to previous reports on covalently
functionalized carbon nanomaterials,23 are
assignable to C=C, C–C, C–N, C–O, and
C=O bonds, respectively (Figure 4). For 5, the same contributions to the
C 1s core-level spectrum are found (Figure S3).

The analysis of the high-resolution N 1s core-level spectra
of 5 and 6 furnished three different contributions.
The first deconvoluted peak, observed at 404.3–403.5 eV, could
be attributed to the quaternary ammonium salts, and the other two
contributions found at lower binding energies could be attributed
to the different types of cyano groups of the heptamethine cyanine
core, which have slightly different binding energies, in the range
from 399.5 to 402.4 eV, because they are differently involved in the
stabilization of the negative charge density of the dye.24

Considered as a whole, XPS analysis of
nanomaterials 5 and 6 demonstrates the presence
of different nitrogenated
functional groups (cyano, ammonium salts, and pyrrolidines) and, ultimately,
the covalent linkage of heptamethine cyanine to SWCNTs and FLG.

To complement the characterization of nanoconjugates 5 and 6, AFM and TEM investigations were employed to
study their morphologies.25

From
TEM, the disaggregation and dispersion of SWCNTs induced through
covalent functionalization in nanoconjugates 5, when
compared with a sample of commercial HiPco SWCNTs, are clearly observed
(Figure S4). Furthermore, AFM reveals topographic
images of commercial HiPco SWCNTs that present most of the SWCNTs
stacked in aggregates of diameters up to 16 nm, whereas in nanomaterial 5, smaller aggregates, with diameters of 2–6 nm and
typical lengths that range from 500 nm to 2 μm, are observed
(Figure 5).

Figure 5 AFM images
of: (a) commercial HiPco SWCNTs and (b, c) nanoconjugate 5. On the right, the height profile of each sample is displayed.

Similar to previous results,26 graphite
exfoliation in oDCB showed FLG nanosheets of less
than five layers stacked with smaller flakes on their surface. The
reaggregation of graphene flakes prior to functionalization was, to
some extent, prevented by keeping the sample in solution because TEM
analysis of nanoconjugate 6 reveals a nanomaterial that
is uniformly disintegrated and with regular flakes that are randomly
stacked onto each other (Figure 6).

and (b) scale bar 10 nm.

Electronic Properties
Raman spectroscopy provides evidence
of the covalent functionalization of SWCNTs and FLG at the time that
allows to obtain valuable information about the structural and electronic
characteristics of the nanomaterials.27

The Raman spectrum of nanoconjugate 5 at 785
nm excitation is characteristic of a SWCNT-based nanomaterial, showing
radial breathing modes (RBMs) between 170 and 310 cm–1, the D band, attributed to the disorder of the carbon hexagonal
lattice on the SWCNT sidewalls (sp3 carbons) at 1293 cm–1 and, the G mode or manual torque-tangential mode,
which corresponds to the stretching mode in the graphite (sp2 carbons), at 1593 cm–1 (Figure 7a). On the basis of the comparison with the
starting SWCNTs, several important conclusions are made: (i) RBM resonance
signals reveal a pattern similar to that of the reference material
and thus the reaction proceeds without preference for metallic or
semiconducting tubes;28 (ii) the D band
increases its intensity, ID/IG = 0.1 for 5 versus ID/IG = 0.06 for the starting SWCNTs,
which proves that the functionalization occurs through covalent bonding
with the sidewall carbon atoms, which convert some sp2 bonding
into sp3;29 and (iii) no appreciable
shifts are observed in the G or G′ modes of nanoconjugate 5 versus the starting SWCNTs and therefore a negligible electronic
interaction seems to be operating in the ground state between heptamethine
cyanine and SWCNTs.30

Figure 7 (a) Raman spectra of
commercial HiPco SWCNTs (black) and 5 (blue) recorded
under 785 nm excitation wavelength. The
inset shows a comparison of D band intensities. (b) Raman spectra
of 6 (blue) and exfoliated FLG (black) in oDCB under 532 nm excitation wavelength. The inset shows the deconvolution
of the two-dimensional (2D) FLG band.

For nanoconjugate 6, the typical Raman bands
of exfoliated
graphite, namely, the D band at 1347 cm–1, the G
band at 1578 cm–1, and the 2D band at 2694 cm–1, are observed by excitation at 532 nm.31 Upon the formation of nanoconjugate 6, the intensity of the D band increases compared to that for the
exfoliated FLG because of the rehybridization of the carbon atoms
from sp2 to sp3 (Figure 7b). Thus, the ID/IG ratio increases from 0.25 for FLG
to 0.46 for 6, indicating the covalent anchoring of the
heptamethine cyanine moiety to FLG. The 2D bands of both the exfoliated
FLG and nanoconjugate 6 are highly symmetric and could
be fitted by a single Lorentzian, which allows to determine the presence
of FLG of around three sheets in the Raman study.32 Moreover, the G band, which is very sensitive to doping
effects, does not experience any shift from exfoliated FLG to nanoconjugate 6, which, similar to the Raman analysis of 5,
indicates a weak or inexistent ground-state interaction between FLG
and the dye.

Finally, the UV–vis–NIR analysis
of 5 and 6, as well as that of formylcyanine 4, permits to corroborate the NIR absorption increase of FLG
and SWCNTs
with the covalent anchoring of heptamethine cyanine (Figures 8 and S5). All of the materials display the characteristic absorption peak
of the dye at ca. 896 nm. For nanoconjugate 5, the absorption
spectrum reflects the loss of the van Hove singularities of SWCNTs,
an observation that once again supports the covalent attachment of
the heptamethine cyanine dye to the sidewalls of SWCNTs.33

Conclusions
In
summary, we have carried out the synthesis of a new type of
NIR absorbing nanomaterials, anionic heptamethine cyanine-based SWCNTs
(5) and FLG (6) nanoconjugates, using 1,3-dipolar
cycloaddition reactions. The systematic and meticulous analyses through
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), FTIR spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) unambiguously confirmed the covalent attachment
of the heptamethine cyanine moiety to the nanocarbons. Furthermore,
the electronic characteristics of the nanoconjugates have been investigated
considering Raman and UV–vis–NIR spectroscopies, which
also confirmed the covalent linkage between the electroactive species.
The new hybrid nanomaterials reveal appealing absorbance in the NIR
region, thus paving the way to a variety of optoelectronic applications.

Experimental
Section
Materials
HiPco SWCNTs were purchased from Carbon Nanotechnologies
(lot: P0261, purity > 82, <18% remaining iron particles, length
= 100–1000 nm, diameter = 0.8–1.4 nm) and used without
any further purification treatment. Graphite from TIMCAL (TIMREX SFG15,
ρ = 2.26 g/cm3, particle size = 8.80 μm, specific
surface = 9.50 m2/g, ashes ≤ 0.100%, interlamellar
distance = 3.354–3.358 Å) was used for the synthesis of
few-layer graphene (FLG). Graphite flakes (200 mg) were dispersed
in anhydrous oDCB (200 mL) and sonicated in a low-power
sonication bath for 150 min under an inert atmosphere to obtain FLG.
The dispersion was centrifuged at 500 rpm for 45 min, and the supernatant
was decanted and stored in solution.

Organic solvents and reagents
used in this work were purchased from commercial suppliers and used
as received, unless stated otherwise. Formylcyanine 4 (Scheme 1) was synthesized
following the previously reported method.16a

Instruments
TGA analyses were carried out under air
and nitrogen in a TA-TGA-Q500 apparatus. The sample (∼0.5 mg)
was introduced inside a platinum crucible and equilibrated at 100
°C, followed by a 10 °C min–1 ramp between
100 and 1000 °C and by an isotherm of 30 min. FTIR spectra were
recorded in Bruker TENSOR 27 using a spectral range of 4000–400
cm–1, with a resolution of 1 cm–1, and in pellets of dispersed samples of the corresponding materials
in dried KBr. Raman spectra were recorded on Renishaw inVia (SWCNTs)
or NT-MDT (FLG) microscopes at room temperature and at 785 or 532
nm wavelength, respectively. XPS analyses were carried out using a
SPECS GmbH (PHOIBOS 150 9MCD) spectrometer operating in the constant
analyzer energy mode. A nonmonochromatic aluminum X-ray source (1486.61
eV) was used with a power of 200 W and voltage of 12 kV. Pass energies
of 75 and 25 eV were used for acquiring both survey and high-resolution
spectra, respectively. Survey data were acquired from kinetic energies
of 1487–400 eV with an energy step of 1 eV and 100 ms dwell
time per point. The high-resolution scans were taken around the emission
lines of interest with 0.1 eV steps and 100 ms dwell time per point.
SpecsLab version 2.48 software was used for spectrometer control and
data handling. The semiquantitative analysis was performed from the
C 1s (284.3 eV) signal. The samples were introduced as pellets of
8 mm diameter. UV–vis–NIR spectra were recorded in a
UV-3600 Shimadzu spectrophotometer. TEM micrographs were obtained
using a JEOL 2100 microscope operating at 200 kV. The samples were
dispersed in oDCB and dropped onto a holey carbon
copper grid (200 mesh), and the solvent was removed in a vacuum oven
for 48 h. AFM was performed on an SPM Nanoscope IIIa multimode microscope
working in tapping mode with an RTESPSS tip (Veeco) at a working frequency
of ∼235 kHz. The samples were prepared by spin-coating on mica.

Synthesis of SWCNT–Cyanine Nanoconjugate 5
Formylcyanine 4 (20 mg) and N-octylglycine
(20 mg) were added to pristine SWCNTs (20 mg) suspended
in oDCB (10 mL). The mixture was sonicated for 10
min and heated under microwave irradiation at 160 °C for 1 h.
The final product was separated from the reaction mixture by filtration
over a poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) membrane (0.2 μm). The
black solid was purified by successive washing in membrane with oDCB, CH2Cl2, and MeOH. FTIR (KBr):
ν = 2922, 2854, 2221, 1718, 1659, 1601, 1422 (broad), 1260,
1096, 1021, and 800 cm–1. TGA: weight loss and temperature

Synthesis of FLG–Cyanine Nanoconjugates 6
The exfoliated FLG in dry oDCB
was utilized
as produced for further covalent modification. To a suspension of
25 mL of FLG in oDCB were added formylcyanine 4 (5 mg) and N-octylglycine (5 mg). The reaction
mixture was submitted for 12 microwave cycles following the sequence
specified in Table 1. After cooling to room temperature, the resulting modified FLG was
separated from the reaction mixture by filtration over a PTFE membrane
(0.2 μm). The black solid was purified by subsequent washing
in membrane with oDCB, CH2Cl2, and MeOH. FTIR (KBr): ν = 2924, 2854, 2218, 1726, 1641, 1581,
1460, 1433, 1157, 1100, and 800 cm–1. TGA: weight
loss and temperature desorption (organic anchoring groups): 20.3%,
400 °C; 10.8%, 650 °C. Raman: ID/IG = 0.45. XPS: % atomic: C (284.6 eV)
= 81.0, O (532.6 eV) = 18.0, and N (399.5 eV) = 1.0. UV–vis–NIR
