A disulfide-bond
formation system for nascent proteins in the Escherichia
coli periplasm contains efficient electron
transfer systems for the catalysis of oxidation. This electrochemical
system has interesting implications in vivo. Disulfide bonds are formed
by disulfide-bond formation protein A (DsbA), which contains two reactive
cysteines. DsbA is reoxidized by a membrane protein, disulfide-bond
formation protein B (DsbB), which has four catalytic cysteines. The
oxidation of DsbA by DsbB seems energetically unfavorable on the basis
of the redox potential. The oxidizing power of ubiquinone (UQ), which
endogenously binds with DsbB, is believed to promote this reaction.
However, using UQ-deficient DsbB, it was found that the oxidation
of DsbA by DsbB proceeds independently of UQ. Thus, the reaction mechanism
of DsbA oxidation by DsbB is under debate. In this study, we used
the quartz crystal microbalance technique, which detects the intermediate
complex between DsbA and DsbB during DsbA oxidation as a change in
mass, to obtain kinetic parameters of DsbA oxidation under both the
oxidized and reduced states of UQ at acidic and basic pH. In addition,
we utilized sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
mobility shift assay technique to determine the pKa of the cysteine thiol groups in DsbA and DsbB. We found
that DsbA oxidation proceeded independently of UQ and was greatly
affected in kinetics by the shuffling of electrons among the four
cysteine residues in DsbB, regardless of pH. These results suggest
that DsbA oxidation is driven in an entropy-dependent manner, in which
the electron-delocalized intermediate complex is stabilized by preventing
a reverse reaction. These findings could contribute to the design
of bio-inspired electrochemical systems for industrial applications.

Introduction
Cells contain a system
for the promotion of disulfide-bond formation
in nascent proteins, which stabilizes the active conformations of
proteins.1,2 This system consists of biomolecules that
relay electrons to a certain direction in conjunction with their oxidation
or reduction processes. To understand electrochemical systems in vivo,
the mechanism of electron relay needs to be elucidated. In the Escherichia coli periplasm, disulfide bonds are generated
by disulfide-bond formation protein A (DsbA, 21 kDa), which is capable
of introducing disulfide bonds to newly synthesized proteins much
faster than the natural oxidation process by oxygen.3−7 DsbA contains a disulfide bond at a pair of cysteine residues, namely
Cys30 and Cys33, which forms a CXXC motif (Figure 1).8−10 An oxidized DsbAS–S receives two electrons (and two protons) from two cysteine thiol
groups in a prefolding protein, forming a disulfide bond in the protein.
The reduced DsbASH,SH passes two electrons to an inner
membrane protein, DsbB (20 kDa), resulting in oxidized DsbAS–S and reduced DsbB. DsbB contains four transmembrane helices and has
four active cysteine residues, namely, Cys41, Cys44, Cys104, and Cys130.11,12 The reduced DsbBS–S,SH,SH is reoxidized by passing
electrons to endogenous lipophilic ubiquinone (UQ), which binds proximately
to DsbB.13−16 Finally, the reduced ubiquinone, namely, ubiquinol (UQ2–), transfers the electrons to oxygen via ubiquinol oxidase.13−16

Figure 1 Protein
disulfide-bond formation system for a newly synthesized
protein in E. coli. The oxidized disulfide-bond
formation protein A (DsbAS–S) promotes the transfer
of two electrons from a prefolding protein to DsbAS–S. The resulting reduced DsbASH,SH is reoxidized by an
inner membrane protein, DsbBS–S,S–S. Finally,
electrons are transferred from DsbB to ubiquinone (UQ), resulting
in ubiquinol (UQ2–). Two proposed pathways (pathway
I and II) are still under debate and are illustrated here (see text
for details). The cysteine residues circled in red play a key function
in DsbA oxidation.

The oxidation process
of DsbA by DsbB is initiated by an attack
of a thiolate anion at Cys30 (DsbA) to a disulfide bond at Cys104–Cys130
(DsbB) (Figure 1).17,18 On the basis of the crystal structure of the complex between DsbA
and DsbB, Cys104 on the peptidyl loop of DsbB is captured by the hydrophobic
groove of DsbA during the formation of an intermolecular disulfide
bond at Cys30 (DsbA)–Cys104 (DsbB).19,20 The separation of the thiolate anion at Cys130 on the flexible peptidyl
loop of DsbB from the intermolecular disulfide bond is thought to
prevent the reverse reaction, resulting in efficient electron transfer
from DsbA to DsbB.19−22 DsbA oxidation is completed via the intramolecular attack of a thiolate
anion of Cys33 (DsbA) on the disulfide bond of Cys30 (DsbA)–Cys104
(DsbB). The resulting reduced DsbB could be reoxidized by UQ.23 In this process, the oxidation of DsbA can proceed
in either a UQ-dependent or independent manner, proposed as pathway
I (Figure 1).17

On the other hand, DsbA oxidation by DsbB
was found to be energetically
unfavorable in terms of a redox potential.18,24 The standard redox potential of the cysteine pair of DsbA (−120
mV for Cys30–Cys33) was higher than the standard redox potential
of the cysteine pairs of DsbB (−207 mV for Cys41–Cys44
and −224 mV for Cys104–Cys130), indicating that DsbB
is significantly less oxidizing than DsbA.18,24 Meanwhile, UQ has a high standard redox potential (+110 mV) and
is believed to be a key component of the electron transport system
as a source of oxidizing power.14,25,26 Accordingly, it is proposed that the oxidization of DsbA could proceed
by coupling with the reduction of UQ, in which DsbB plays a role as
a mediator of electron transfer, namely, via a concerted pathway (pathway
II in Figure 1).18,27

However, UQ-deficient DsbB has been used to demonstrate that
the
oxidation of DsbA by DsbB occurs independently of UQ in spite of being
an energetically unfavorable reaction.17 Thus, the driving forces of the electron transfer are yet to be
elucidated and the two proposed reaction pathways are still under
debate.17,18 In addition, the pH of the environment may
affect the electron transfer mechanism of the system.3 Generally, the nucleophilicity of a cysteine residue is
influenced by pH because the ratio of a reactive thiolate anion to
a thiol is largely dependent on pH, according to the pKa of the cysteine thiol group. Therefore, it is also necessary
to quantitatively evaluate the pKa of
the cysteine thiol groups in DsbA and DsbB to understand the electron
transfer mechanism.18

Previously,
the oxidation of DsbA by DsbB has been observed using
the sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
mobility shift assay4,17 and absorbance measurements.26,28 The SDS-PAGE mobility shift assay is able to detect the intermediate
complex between DsbA and DsbB. However, SDS-PAGE is not suitable to
obtain a kinetic parameter quantitatively.4,17 Absorbance
measurements can be used to determine the time courses of DsbA oxidation.
Nevertheless, it is difficult to estimate the difference in reactivity
among each of the six thiolate groups in DsbA and DsbB because the
absorbance measurement took into account the changes of the only two
absorbance intensities of UQ and a tryptophan residue in DsbA during
the oxidation process.26,28 NMR revealed the residue-specific
information and provided functional insights into the electron transfer
between DsbA and DsbB.21,25 However, it is still difficult
to obtain kinetic parameters in the process of oxidation of DsbA by
DsbB.

Here, we focused on the effect of UQ and the pH-dependent
reactivity
of the thiol groups on the reaction kinetics to determine the mechanism
of efficient electron transfer among DsbA, DsbB, and UQ. We used a
quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) biosensor to detect real-time mass
changes on a sensor plate at the nanogram level, allowing us to obtain
the kinetic parameters for an interaction of various biomolecules.29−32 The oxidization reaction of DsbA has been successfully detected
as the mass change in DsbA–DsbB complex formation using DsbB
embedded in a supported lipid bilayer on a sensor plate.33,34 In this study, we investigated the effect of UQ on the kinetic parameters
of the DsbA–DsbB reaction under various pH conditions using
QCM to determine the driving force of the electron transfer. The redox
state in the QCM cell was adjusted using redox buffers, allowing us
to determine the kinetic parameters under the controlled oxidation/reduction
state of DsbB and UQ. Furthermore, we directly measured the reactivity
of reactive cysteine residues in DsbA and DsbB to obtain the pKa values by SDS-PAGE using the alkylating agent
of poly(ethylene glycol), containing a maleimide moiety. It is difficult
to determine a precise pKa value of a
catalytic cysteine residue using chemical reactions with an agent
that reacts with thiol groups such as a maleimide group. This is because
the resulting pKa value contains a systematic
error introduced by the reaction conditions. Although it is necessary
to apply the apparent pKa value judiciously,
it is suitable for ascertaining the reaction mechanism, which is the
main objective of this study. Finally, the pH-dependent reaction mechanism
of DsbA oxidation by DsbB was discussed on the basis of the kinetic
parameters and the pKa of thiol groups
in DsbA and DsbB.

Results and Discussion
Effect of Redox States
of DsbB and UQ on the Stability of DsbA–DsbB
Complex Evaluated by QCM Analyses
QCM detects the reaction
intermediate of DsbASH,SH and DsbBS–S,S–S as a change in mass.33,34 Two electrons are transferred
from DsbASH,SH to DsbBS–S,S–S during
the oxidation process of DsbA. A single electron-transferred DsbA–DsbB
complex formation was previously monitored using a DsbA(C33A)SH mutant and DsbBS–S,S–S by QCM measurements.33,34 Thus, the efficiency of the electron transfer can be evaluated by
the stability of the single electron-transferred complex. To investigate
the effect of a redox state of DsbB and UQ on complex formation, we
monitored frequency changes as a function of time, responding to the
addition of DsbA(C33A)SH to a QCM plate immobilized with
oxidized DsbBS–S,S–S, hemioxidized DsbBS–S,SH,SH, or reduced DsbBSH,SH,SH,SH (Figure 2). The redox states
of oxidized, hemioxidized, and reduced DsbB were adjusted by a redox
buffer set at −162, −222, and −282 mV, respectively,
where UQ (+110 mV) was in a reduced state, denoted as UQ2–. Although oxidized DsbBS–S,S–S resulted
in complex formation (curve c), reduced DsbBSH,SH,SH,SH did not respond to DsbA(C33A)SH (curve a). The amount
of complex formation between DsbA(C33A)SH and hemioxidized
DsbBS–S,SH,SH (curve b) was smaller than that between
DsbA(C33A)SH and oxidized DsbBS–S,S–S. The complex formation behavior between DsbA(C33A)SH and
hemioxidized DsbBS–S,SH,SH was similar to that between
DsbA(C33A)SH and DsbB(C41A,C44A)S–S,
with only two reactive cysteine residues, as reported previously.33 These results suggest that the stability of
the single electron-transferred complex is dependent on the number
of electron receivable cysteine residues in DsbB.

Figure 2 Effect of redox states
of DsbB on time courses of frequency changes
(ΔF) showing the complex formation between
DsbA(C33A)SH and DsbB in the QCM experiments. DsbA(C33A)SH was added to the QCM plate immobilized with (a) reduced
DsbBSH,SH,SH,SH, (b) hemioxidized DsbBS–S,SH,SH, and (c) oxidized DsbBS–S,S–S in a supported
lipid bilayer. After the redox potential in each QCM cell was adjusted
by a redox buffer at (a) −282 mV, (b) −222 mV, and (c)
−162 mV, the experiments were carried out under the following
conditions: 50 mM citrate, pH 6.0, and 100 mM NaCl at 25 °C.
[DsbA] = 2700 nM in 500 μL, and [DsbB] = 16 pmol/cm2 on the QCM plate.

The effect of UQ on the
efficiency of DsbA oxidation was examined
by kinetic analyses, where an excess of UQ-10 was added to the QCM
plate with DsbBS–S,S–S embedded in the supported
lipid bilayers. For comparison, a QCM plate with DsbBS–S,S–S bound to UQ2– was prepared by setting the redox
potential at −162 mV to convert the endogenous UQ into reduced
UQ2–. The complex formation of DsbA(C33A)SH with DsbBS–S,S–S in an excess of UQ or
the presence of UQ2– was monitored using the QCM
device under a variety of DsbA(C33A)SH concentrations at
pH 6.0, 7.5, and 9.0 (Figures S1–S3). The complex formation rate constants (kf) and the reverse rate constants (kr)
were obtained by the curve fitting method.33 There were no differences between the resultant kinetic parameters
under an excess of UQ and the presence of UQ2– at
each pH (Table 1).
Thus, the kf and kr were not influenced by the redox state of UQ, indicating
that the DsbA oxidation by DsbB proceeded without the aid of an oxidizing
power of UQ over a pH range from 6.0 to 9.0.

To confirm that
the exogenous UQ can affect the DsbB–UQ
complex immobilized on a QCM plate, we designed the following experiment.
DsbASH,SH was first added to the DsbB-immobilized QCM plate
to reduce DsbBS–S,S–S (Figure S4a). Then, an excess of UQ-1 was added to DsbBS–S,SH,SH externally to reoxidize the DsbB. Finally,
DsbA(C33A)SH was added to the DsbB-immobilized QCM plate.
We found that DsbA(C33A)SH could bind with DsbB in the
presence of UQ-1, whereas DsbA(C33A)SH could not bind with
DsbB in the absence of UQ-1 (Figure S4b). The reactivation of the complex formation between DsbA(C33A)SH and DsbB resulted from the reoxidation of DsbB, by replacing
endogenous UQ2– with exogenous UQ or by only oxidizing
endogenous UQ2– with added UQ.

To determine
the driving force of DsbA oxidation, the kinetic parameters
of complex formation between DsbA(C33A)SH and DsbB(C41A,C44A)S–S were compared with those between DsbA(C33A)SH and DsbBS–S,S–S, as shown in Table 1. The association
constants (Ka) in the complex formation
between DsbA(C33A)SH and DsbBS–S,S–S or DsbB(C41A,C44A)S–S were obtained as the ratio
of kf to kr. The Ka values of the complex formation
between DsbA(C33A)SH and DsbBS–S,S–S were approximately 10–100 times greater than those between
DsbA(C33A)SH and DsbB(C41A,C44A)S–S at
each pH. The electron shuffling among four cysteine residues in DsbB
induced energetically favorable delocalization of the electrons and
significantly contributed to the stabilization of the DsbA–DsbB
complex (Ka increase), thus facilitating
DsbA oxidation. Therefore, the oxidation of DsbA by DsbB proceeds
in an entropy-driven manner independent of UQ.

pKa Determination of Cysteine Residues
in DsbA
On the basis of the kinetic analyses in the QCM experiments,
DsbA oxidation was influenced by pH. The kr values were approximately 10 times higher under alkaline conditions
than those under acidic conditions (Table 1), suggesting that the pKa of a thiol group at Cys130 or Cys44 in DsbB is involved
in the reverse reaction. The progress of DsbA oxidation depends on
the competition between the reverse attack of Cys130 in DsbB and the
oxidation attack of Cys33 in DsbA. Therefore, we determined the pKa of the cysteine residues in DsbA and DsbB.

First, DsbA mutants were modified with poly(ethylene glycol) (5
kDa), containing a maleimide moiety (malPEG), under pH conditions
ranging from pH 3 to 11 to investigate the pKa of cysteine residues (Cys30 and Cys33) in DsbA (Figure S5). Then, the DsbA samples were subjected
to SDS-PAGE (Figure 3). The DsbA(C33A)SH demonstrated malPEG-modified products
at 26 kDa above pH 3, showing that the Cys30 in DsbA(C33A)SH was reactive as a thiolate anion when pH was above 3 (Figure 3a). The reactivity of Cys30
in DsbA(C33A)SH decreased slightly at the pH above 10.
The decrease in reactivity was probably due to the denaturation of
DsbA(C33A)SH, which was consistent with the previous literature.34 On the basis of the SDS-PAGE mobility shift
assay using DsbA(C30A)SH (Figure 3b), Cys33 reacted with the alkylating agent
above pH 8.

Figure 3 Effect of pH on the amount of DsbA (21 kDa) modified with maleimide–poly(ethylene
glycol) (malPEG, 5 kDa) over a pH range from 3 to 11 by SDS-PAGE analyses:
(a) DsbA(C33A)SH and (b) DsbA(C30A)SH.

The reactivity between thiolate
anions of DsbA and malPEG was quantified,
as shown in Figure 4. On the basis of the effect of pH on the reactivity of the Cys30
in DsbA(C33A)SH (Figure 4a), the pKa of Cys30 should
be below 3. This low pKa value correlates
with that of a previous study, which reported that the pKa of Cys30 in DsbA was approximately 3.4 on the basis
of the higher absorption of a thiolate anion at 240 nm during pH titration.35 The extraordinarily low pKa of Cys30 was also supported by the previous QCM measurement
used to monitor the oxidation of DsbASH,SH by DsbBS–S,S–S under the acidic pH range.34 The resultant QCM chart showed the complex formation
and the following dissociation behavior with high reaction activity
during DsbASH,SH oxidation under the pH range of 4.0–6.0.
The pKa of Cys33 was also evaluated by
the SDS-PAGE result using DsbA(C30A)SH, demonstrating that
the pKa of Cys33 was approximately 8.3
(Figure 4b). In native
DsbASH,SH, the low pKa of Cys30
could provide an anionic field around Cys33 in the pH range above
the pKa of Cys30, which may shift the
pKa of Cys33 to higher pH. However, the
reactivity of Cys33 should be investigated when forming a noncharged
disulfide bond in the DsbA–DsbB complex. Thus, the apparent
pKa obtained using a DsbA(C30A) mutant
is more suitable for discussing the reaction mechanism.

Figure 4 Effect of pH
on the reactivity of cysteine residues in DsbA with
malPEG over a pH range from 3 to 11: (a) DsbA(C33A)SH and
(b) DsbA(C30A)SH.

When native DsbASH,SH was used in the SDS-PAGE
mobility
shift assay, DsbASH,SH reacted with malPEG only in the
pH range of 3.0–8.0 (Figure S6).
This can be explained as immediate conversion of malPEG-modified DsbASH,SH to DsbAS–S due to an intramolecular
nucleophilic attack from thiolate anion at Cys33 in the alkaline condition
(pH > 8). This result is consistent with the pKa (8.3) at Cys33 determined by using DsbA(C30A)SH. Thus, we determined that malPEG could be used to determine pKa.

pKa Determination
of Cysteine Residues
in DsbB
The pKa value of Cys44
and Cys130, of which thiolate anions play a key role in electron shuffling
in DsbB, was evaluated by SDS-PAGE mobility shift assay using DsbB(C41A)SH,S–S and DsbB(C104A)S–S,SH, respectively.
The amount of malPEG-modified DsbB(C41A)SH,S–S and
DsbB(C104A)S–S,SH was monitored over a pH range
from 4.0 to 9.5 (Figure 5). The alkylation of Cys residues by malPEG was incomplete because
of the air-facilitated oxidation of Cys residues and/or the short
alkylation time due to the bulky alkylating agent. However, this does
not affect the relative comparison of reactivity to the same position
at the same reaction time. The reactivity of Cys44 with malPEG increased
at higher pH (Figure 5a). Likewise, the alkylation of Cys130 was enhanced at higher pH
(Figure 5b). The effect
of pH on the reactivity of Cys44 and Cys130 with malPEG was plotted
as a function of pH (Figure 6), which resulted in a pKa value
of Cys44 and Cys130 of approximately 7. The pKa of Cys44 correlates with a previous study where pKa of Cys44 was 6.6 based on the absorbance at
500 nm derived from the UQ-dependent electron transition at Cys44.23

and malPEG over a pH range from 4.0 to 9.5 using DsbB mutants: (a)

Effect of UQ on the pKa of Cysteine
Residues in DsbB
DsbBS–S,S–S reoxidizes
the reduced DsbASH,SH. Then, the reduced DsbBS–S,SH,SH is recycled by UQ, which proximately binds to DsbB in the lipid
membrane. Previous studies revealed that the thiolate anion of Cys44
in DsbB forms a charge-transfer complex with UQ during the reduction
of DsbB.25,26 There is the possibility that the UQ changes
the pKa of the reactive cysteine residues
in DsbB. Thus, the effect of UQ on the pKa of cysteine residues in DsbB was evaluated with a SDS-PAGE mobility
shift assay using DsbB bound either with an excess of UQ or with UQ2–. To arrange DsbB with an excess of UQ, UQ-1 was solubilized
with surfactant of n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside
(DDM) to form a micelle with DsbB. Meanwhile, to arrange the DsbB
with UQ2–, the redox potential was adjusted to −162
mV, at which UQ exists as UQ2– and DsbB exists as
oxidized DsbBS–S,S–S. The amount of malPEG-modified
Cys44 and Cys130 in DsbB was investigated over a pH range from 4.0
to 9.5 under an excess of UQ or with UQ2– (Figures S7 and S8). On the basis of the SDS-PAGE
data, the modification of Cys44 and Cys130 with malPEG occurred at
higher pH values. The effect of pH on the reactivity of Cys44 and
Cys130 was plotted against pH, which showed that the pKa of Cys44 and Cys130 in DsbB were both approximately
7 independently of the redox state of UQ. These results indicate that
the UQ does not influence the pKa value
of Cys44 and Cys130 in DsbB.

pH-Dependent Reaction Mechanism for DsbA
Oxidation by DsbB
We propose that DsbB-catalyzed DsbA oxidation
is an entropy-driven
reaction originating from delocalization of electrons among four cysteine
residues in DsbB, which proceeds independently of an oxidizing power
of UQ over a wide range of pH values. On the other hand, it has been
confirmed that DsbA oxidation by DsbB(C41A,C44A)S–S proceeds under acidic conditions, with pH values ranging from 3
to 7.34 Here, we summarize the pH-dependent
reaction into two pathways (Figure 7). One pathway is the “4Cys pathway”,
in which DsbA oxidation occurs through the stable complex between
DsbA and DsbB using four cysteine residues in DsbB. The other pathway
is the “2Cys pathway” and occurs through simple dithiol–disulfide
exchanges between DsbA and DsbB using only two cysteine residues in
DsbB. Both pathways are initiated by the nucleophilic attack of Cys30
in DsbA to Cys104–Cys130 disulfide bond in DsbB. In an acidic
pH ranging from 3 to 7, the reverse reaction to the initial stage
is restricted because the thiol group of Cys130 is protonated due
to the pKa of 7 at Cys130 (Figure 7A). Electron shuffling among
the four cysteine residues takes place in DsbB, followed by DsbA oxidation
via the 4Cys pathway. Direct dithiol–disulfide exchanges can
also occur to some degree via the 2Cys pathway, due to the small effect
of the reverse reaction. On the basis of the Ka values of DsbA oxidation at pH 6, the complex formation ratios
for the 4Cys and 2Cys pathways were calculated using eq 1 in the Materials
and Methods as a ratio of the amount of the DsbA–DsbB
complex to the total amount of DsbB. The ratios for the 4Cys and 2Cys
pathways could be approximately 92 and 4%, respectively. On the other
hand, in an alkaline pH ranging from 7 to 10, the DsbA–DsbB
complex is slightly unstable (Ka decrease)
due to a reverse reaction with the thiolate anion of Cys130 in DsbB
(pKa = 7) in comparison with Cys33 in
DsbA (pKa = 8.3). The complex formation
ratio for the 2Cys pathway at pH 9 was calculated to be approximately
1%. In contrast, once the DsbA–DsbB complex is formed, the
electron shuffling among the four cysteine residues occurs inside
DsbB, resulting in a thiolate anion of Cys44 in DsbB (Figure 7B). Then, the electrostatic
interaction forms between the thiolate anion of Cys44 (DsbB) and the
guanidinium cation of Arg48 (DsbB), which stabilizes the DsbA–DsbB
complex and prevents the reverse reaction.13,36 Then, the intramolecular nucleophilic attack in DsbA occurs to oxidize
DsbA via the 4Cys pathway (the complex formation ratio is 15%).

(a) The kcat values were obtained from
our previous reports.33,34 (b) The approximate rate values
were calculated as first order rate constants of kf[DsbA] at [DsbA] = 0.1 μM using the kf values of DsbBS–S,S–S and UQ
(pH 6 and 9) for the 4Cys pathway and DsbB(C41A,C44A)S–S and UQ (pH 6 and 9) for the 2Cys pathway in Table 1. (c) The approximate kr values were obtained from Table 1 in the same manner. (d) The complex formation
ratios were calculated from eq 1 in the Materials and Methods as a
ratio of the amount of DsbA–DsbB complex to the total amount
of DsbB at [DsbA] = 0.1 μM.

Four cysteine residues in DsbB act together to stabilize
the DsbA–DsbB
complex, facilitating DsbA oxidation over a wide range of pH values.
Recently, the entropic force generated by an intrinsically disordered
segment was found to determine the function of the protein.37 Also, in the case of the DsbA–DsbB complex,
the entropic force generated by a flexible Cys104-containing loop
in DsbB played a key role in DsbA oxidation. In addition, the equal
pKa values of Cys44 and Cys130 are likely
to facilitate electron shuffling in DsbB. Electron shuffling with
a gain in entropy could stabilize the intermediate complex of DsbA
and DsbB, contributing to overcoming the energetically uphill reaction
of the redox potential between DsbA and DsbB.

Conclusions
The driving force of DsbA oxidation by DsbB against the energetically
uphill reaction of the redox potential remains a topic of debate.
In this study, DsbB was immobilized on a QCM plate with excess UQ
or with UQ2–, allowing us to obtain the kinetic
parameters of DsbA oxidation under various pH conditions. The resulting
kinetic parameters were not dependent on the redox state of UQ but
were largely dependent on the number of electron receivable cysteine
residues in DsbB over a wide pH range. Electron shuffling among the
four cysteine residues of DsbB was important to prevent the reverse
reaction (kr values decrease) and stabilize
the single electron-transferred complex between DsbA and DsbB (Ka values increase). Thus, DsbA oxidation generally
progressed through the 4Cys pathway utilizing the four cysteine residues
whether under acidic or alkaline conditions, which could be achieved
in an entropy-driven manner independent of UQ. Furthermore, the pKa values of the reactive cysteine residues in
DsbA and DsbB were obtained using a SDS-PAGE mobility shift assay.
Combined with the kinetic parameters and the pKa of the reactive cysteine residues in DsbA and DsbB, we elucidated
the pH-dependent reaction mechanisms in an E. coli disulfide-bond formation system. Under acidic conditions, where
the reverse reaction was partly prevented due to the protonation of
thiol groups, the direct exchange between dithiol and disulfide bonds
occurred to some extent. However, under alkaline conditions, the reverse
reaction prevents the formation of a complex between DsbA and DsbB
due to the reactive thiolate anion of Cys130, especially in the 2Cys
pathway. Thus, DsbA oxidation over a wide pH range is achieved by
the 4Cys pathway. E. coli may have
evolved a pH robust-oxidative protein folding system because the pH
of the periplasm region, where DsbA and DsbB are located, is variable
depending on the environmental pH. The findings on the reaction mechanisms
in E. coli can contribute not only
to the development of antibacterial drugs that target the bacterial
disulfide-bond formation process but also to the design of bio-inspired
efficient electrochemical devices for industrial use.

Unless stated otherwise, all other reagents were purchased from Nacalai
Tesque Co. (Kyoto, Japan). Type 1 ultrapure water (MilliQ water, Merck
Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) was used in all experiments.

Preparation
of DsbA and Its Variants
DsbA and its variants
were expressed according to previous reports.33,34 Briefly, a 627 bp fragment encoding DsbA (EC 5.3.4.1) was obtained
from the genomic DNA of E. coli JM109
and then cloned into pET22b(+). Two vectors for the expression of
DsbA(C33A)SH and DsbA(C30A)SH were prepared
using site-directed mutagenesis. E. coli JM109 (DE3) harboring each expression vector was grown in LB broth
with ampicillin and then isopropyl-β-d-thio-galactopyranoside
(IPTG) was added into the medium to overexpress the protein. After
the cells were converted into spheroplasts, the supernatant containing
the periplasmic contents was collected and repeatedly dialyzed against
a buffer solution. The collected solution was added to a DEAE FF anion
exchange column (GE Healthcare). The target proteins were obtained
by elution with a linear gradient of NaCl in a buffer solution and
stored at −80 °C until further use.

Preparation
of Biotin-BCCP-DsbBS–S,S–S and Its Variants
The procedure to express the DsbB derivatives
used in this study was obtained from previous studies.33,34 DsbB was expressed with the biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP)
tag, which included a region biotinylated by an endogenous biotin
ligase in E. coli. Briefly, an amplified
fragment encoding DsbB (EC 1.8.4.2) was obtained with the same procedure
as DsbA and cloned into pET22b(+). The codons for the two nonessential
cysteine residues, Cys-8 and Cys-49, were then replaced by alanine
and valine codons, respectively, using site-directed mutagenesis,
to prevent disulfide-linked oligomerization. A fragment encoding the
BCCP tag was inserted into the C-terminus of the DsbB-coding region
of the vector. The vectors for the DsbB mutants were prepared using
site-directed mutagenesis.

E. coli C41 (DE3) harboring each expression vector was grown in LB broth
with ampicillin. Then, overexpression was induced using IPTG. The
cells suspended in a buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mM
NaCl, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) were passed through a French
press. After the cell lysate was centrifuged to collect the membrane
fractions as a pellet, the membrane pellet was homogenized and passed
through a syringe needle (inner diameter: 0.7 mm). The suspension,
which was a mixture with a DDM solution at a final concentration of
1%, was ultracentrifuged to remove insoluble membrane fractions. The
supernatant was loaded on a nickel–nitrilotriacetic acid column
(GE Healthcare), and the target protein was eluted from the column
by an imidazole gradient. The collected protein was additionally purified
on a gel filtration column (Superdex 200 pg, GE Healthcare) in a buffer
solution (50 mM phosphate, pH 6.0, 300 mM NaCl, 0.1% DDM) and stored
at −80 °C until further use.

Kinetic Analysis of Complex
Formation of DsbA Variants with
DsbB Embedded in a Supported Lipid Bilayer on a QCM Plate
The QCM experiments using an AFFINIX Q4 system (Initium Co. Ltd.,
Tokyo, Japan) were performed according to our procedures, as previously
reported.33,34 Briefly, NeutrAvidin (60 kDa) was immobilized
covalently on a 27 MHz QCM plate with an Au electrode (diameter: 2.7
mm; area: 5.7 mm2), which was attached to the bottom of
a QCM cell (volume: 500 μL). A predetermined amount of biotin-BCCP-DsbBS–S,S–S solubilized with DDM was immobilized
on the NeutrAvidin-immobilized QCM plate using avidin–biotin
interaction. The buffer solution including DDM in the QCM cell was
replaced by a mixed micelle solution consisting of total lipids from E. coli and DDM. To prepare the lipid bilayers containing
excess UQ-10, UQ-10 (0.3 mg, corresponding to 11 mol%) was mixed with
a chloroform solution of lipid extract from E. coli, followed by evaporation. The remnant layer of the lipid extract
and UQ-10 was suspended in 0.1% DDM buffer to generate a mixed micelle
solution of the lipid and UQ-10. After incubating to form an E. coli lipid bilayer around the immobilized DsbB,
the remaining DDM was removed from the QCM cell by replenishing a
buffer solution (50 mM citrate, pH 6.0, and 100 mM NaCl) without DDM
several times.

To oxidize only DsbB but reduce UQ, the QCM cell
was incubated for 2 h with a redox buffer (50 mM phosphate, pH 8.0,
100 mM NaCl, 100 mM oxidized DTT, and 1 μM reduced DTT), resulting
in a redox potential (−162 mV) between that of DsbB (−224
to −207 mV) and UQ (+110 mV). After incubation, the QCM cell
containing oxidized DsbBS–S,S–S and UQ2– was filled with 500 μL of a reaction buffer
at pH 6.0 (50 mM citrate), pH 7.5 (50 mM N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES)–NaOH), or pH
9.0 (50 mM Tris–HCl) with 100 mM NaCl. After the QCM cell was
set in the device and pre-equilibrated at 25 °C, the frequency
changes of the QCM in response to the addition of reduced DsbA variants
were measured over time. The resulting curves of the frequency decrease
(mass increase) were analyzed kinetically to obtain the kf and kr values using the
curve fitting method, as previously described.33,34 The complex formation ratio ([C]/[C]max) was calculated
using eq 1 1  where [C] is the number of moles of the DsbA–DsbB
complex, [C]max is the maximum number, Ka is kf/kr, and [DsbA]0 is the initial molar concentration.

Determination of pKa of Cysteine
Residues in DsbA by SDS-PAGE
In a 1.5 mL microtube, 1 μL
of DsbA (4.5 μM) was incubated in 7 μL of buffer solution
(100 mM) and 1 μL of NaOH-neutralized TCEP (2 mM) for a reducing
pretreatment. Then, the reduced DsbA was reacted with 1 μL of
malPEG (2 mM) for 2 h at 25 °C, where a buffer solution was set
at various pH values using citrate (pH 3.0–6.0), 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (MOPS)–NaOH (pH
6.5–7.0), HEPES–NaOH (pH 7.5), Tris–HCl (pH 8.0–9.0),
or glycine–NaOH (pH 10.0–11.0). Then, DsbA was recovered
as a pellet using trichloroacetic acid precipitation. The resulting
pellet was washed twice with cold acetone and subjected to 12% reducing
gel by SDS-PAGE, followed by detection using the Gel Doc EZ System
(Bio-Rad) after staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The band intensity
was quantified using Image Lab software equipped with the Gel Doc
EZ System. The reactivity of the cysteine thiol group with malPEG
was evaluated by the ratio of the band intensity corresponding to
the malPEG-modified DsbA to the band intensity corresponding to the
sum of malPEG-modified and unmodified DsbA. The resultant sigmoid
curve showing the reactivity as a function of pH was transformed into
a linear plot using logit–log conversion, as shown in eq 2(38) 2  where x is the
experimental
pH value and y is the reactivity of the cysteine
thiol group with malPEG. The pKa of the
cysteine residue was calculated as an intercept at the X axis.

Determination of pKa of Cysteine
Residues in DsbB by SDS-PAGE
To prepare DsbBS–S,S–S bound with reduced UQ, 1 μL of DsbB (45 μM) solubilized
with DDM was incubated for 2 h with the redox buffer (50 mM phosphate,
pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 100 mM oxidized DTT, 1 μM reduced DTT,
0.1% DDM). After treatment, DsbB was recovered using a Zeba Desalting
Spin Column. For the preparation of DsbB containing excess UQ, DsbB
was incubated for 2 h with 29 equiv of UQ-1 (1.5 mM) for DsbB in a
buffer solution (50 mM phosphate, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% DDM) and
used for the experiment.

The DDM-solubilized DsbB was incubated
with 44 equiv of malPEG for 30 min at 37 °C in a solution set
at various pH values using 70 mM citrate (pH 4.0–6.0), MOPS–NaOH
(pH 6.5–7.0), HEPES–NaOH (pH 7.5), Tris–HCl (pH
8.0–9.0), or glycine–NaOH (pH 9.5) including 0.1% DDM.
Then, the DsbB was analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE. The pKa was calculated from logit–log conversion of the
resultant sigmoid curve using eq 2.
