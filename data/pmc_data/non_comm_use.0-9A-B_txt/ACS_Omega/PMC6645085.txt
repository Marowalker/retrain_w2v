A simple
synthetic route to a novel sterically hindered triptycene-based diamine,
1,3,6,8-tetramethyl-2,7-diaminotriptycene (TMDAT), and its use in
the preparation of high molecular weight polyimides of intrinsic microporosity
(PIM-PIs) are reported. The organosoluble TMDAT-derived polyimides
displayed high Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface areas
ranging between 610 and 850 m2 g–1 and
demonstrated excellent thermal stability of up to 510 °C. Introduction
of the rigid three-dimensional paddlewheel triptycene framework and
the tetramethyl-induced restriction of the imide bond rotation resulted
in highly permeable polyimides with moderate gas-pair selectivity.
The best performing polyimide made from TMDAT and a triptycene-based
dianhydride showed gas transport properties located between the 2008
and 2015 polymer permeability/selectivity trade-off curves with H2 and O2 permeabilities of 2858 and 575 barrer combined
with H2/N2 and O2/N2 selectivities
of 24 and 4.8, respectively, after 200 days of physical aging.

1 Introduction
Since
their introduction in 2004, a wide variety of ladder polymers
of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs) were intensively studied
because of their potential commercial applications in catalysis,1−3 sensors for trace substance detection,4,5 gas storage,6−8 nanofiltration,9,10 pervaporation,11,12 and most importantly membrane-based gas separations.13−29 The microporosity in these unique glassy ladder polymers was induced
by design of nonplanar bulky contortion sites and the rigidity of
the polymer chains that restricted efficient chain packing and, consequently,
introduced high free volume with interconnected micropores (<2
nm).1−3

Aromatic polyimides are among the most promising materials
for advanced gas separation membranes owing to their (i) excellent
gas transport properties, (ii) exceptional thermal and chemical stability,
(iii) high mechanical strength, (iv) good film-forming properties,
and (v) flexible chemistry.30−35 Recently, polyimides of intrinsic microporosity (PIM-PIs) were developed by introducing sterically hindered diamine-
and/or dianhydride building blocks in the polymer backbone, including
spirobisindane-, ethanoanthracene-, spirobifluorene-, Tröger’s
base-, carbocyclic pseudo Tröger’s base-, and triptycene-derived
units.36−56 PIM-PIs showed attractive gas separation properties for several
important gas pairs with performance near or above the 2008 permeability/selectivity
Robeson upper bounds.57 Specifically, triptycene
has been used as an attractive organic building block to construct
PIM-PIs because of its unique nonplanar three-dimensional (3D) rigid
paddlewheel architecture comprising three benzene groups connected
at 120° around a [2,2,2]-tricyclic ring system.49 The rigidity and the nonplanar contortion site of the triptycene
motif frustrate efficient polymer chain packing and generate high
intrinsic internal free volume.49,50

Previous work
showed that the introduction of ortho-substituted methyl groups in
diamine monomers restricted the rotation of the imide linkages, thereby
enhancing the rigidity, solubility, microporosity, and gas permeability
of the corresponding polyimides.37−39,46,51,58 In extension to our previous work on triptycene-based PIM-PIs and
to combine the potential of using the triptycene moiety and tetra-o-methyl substituents for the construction of new PIM-PI
materials, here, we report a facile method for the synthesis of a
novel 1,3,6,8-tetramethyl-2,7-diaminotriptycene (TMDAT) monomer. This
new protocol has advantages of using a low-cost starting material, m-xylene, and simple synthetic chemistry to prepare solution-processable,
high molecular weight triptycene-based PIM-PIs with enhanced porosity
and gas permeability. The pure-gas permeation properties of a series
of TMDAT-based PIM-PIs are reported for fresh and aged membrane samples.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthetic Route to TMDAT
The TMDAT monomer was synthesized by a simple synthetic route in
four steps starting from m-xylene, as shown in Scheme 1a. The key intermediate
1,3,6,8-tetramethylanthracene (TMA) was obtained as a major product
from the Friedel–Crafts alkylation reaction of m-xylene with dichloromethane (DCM) in the presence of aluminum chloride
using the procedure reported by Ellison and Hey.59 The Diels–Alder reaction of tetramethylanthracene
with the diazonium salt of 2-aminobenzoic acid yielded 1,3,6,8-tetramethyltriptycene
(TMT). Nitration of TMA using potassium nitrate and trifluoroacetic
anhydride followed by palladium-catalyzed hydrazine reduction of the
dinitro intermediate [1,3,6,8-tetramethyl-2,7-dinitrotriptycene (TMDNT)]
yielded the diamine product TMDAT. The purity and molecular structures
of all products were confirmed by standard characterization techniques,
such as 1H- and 13C NMR, Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR), and high-resolution mass spectroscopic analyses. The molecular
structure of TMDNT was also confirmed by single-crystal X-ray crystallography
analysis.

TMDAT and (b) a Series of Intrinsically Microporous TMDAT-Based Polyimides
Using Various Dianhydrides
The FTIR spectra of TMDNT and the TMDAT monomer are shown
in Figure 1a. TMDAT
showed characteristic absorption bands in the range of 3450, 3377,
and 2943 cm–1 because of N–H stretching vibrations
of the amine groups and the C–H stretching frequency of the
methyl groups, respectively. The disappearance of the two characteristic
absorption bands at 1515 and 1364 cm–1 assigned
for the symmetric and asymmetric stretching frequency of the nitro
groups in TMDNT confirmed the complete reduction to the diamine groups,
respectively.

Figure 1 (a) FTIR spectra of TMDNT and TMDAT and (b) 1H NMR spectra of TMDNT and TMDAT.

The 1H NMR spectra for both TMDAT and TMDNT products
confirmed their chemical structures and purity. As shown in Figure 1b, the signals at
(2.07, 2.37) and (2.21, 2.44) ppm are assigned for the methyl protons
of TMDAT and TMDNT, respectively. The protons of the amino groups
appeared as broad singlet at 4.07 ppm. The signals assigned for the
bridgehead protons of TMDAT and TMDNT appeared at (5.12, 5.86) and
(5.39, 5.90) ppm, respectively. The molecular structure of TMDNT was
further validated by single-crystal X-ray crystallographic analysis
(Figures 2 and S2), which confirmed the nonplanarity and 3D
architecture of the triptycene moiety and the selective nitration
at the 2,7-positions of triptycene.

2.2 Synthesis
and Characterization of TMDAT-Based Polyimides
Five polyimides
were prepared under nitrogen via a one-step high-temperature solution
cycloimidization reaction of equimolar amounts of TMDAT and the aromatic
dianhydride monomers in m-cresol containing two drops
of isoquinoline, as shown in Scheme 1b. The polymers were characterized by 1H
NMR, FTIR, gel permeation chromatography (GPC), thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA), and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface
area measurements. The 1H NMR spectra for all polymers
were consistent with their proposed chemical structures. The 1H NMR spectrum of a representative polyimide, 4,4′-(hexafluoroisopropylidene)diphthalic
anhydride (6FDA)-TMDAT, is shown in Figure 3. The two singlets at 2.08 and 2.30 ppm each
integrated for six protons were assigned to the methyl protons. The
bridgehead protons appeared at 5.40 and 5.90 ppm, whereas the aromatic
protons appeared in the range of 7.03–8.01 ppm. The complete
imidization of the polyamic acid precursor was confirmed by the disappearance
of the acid or amide signals at 10–12 ppm. The FTIR spectrum
of 6FDA-TMDAT (Figure S1) showed two characteristic
absorptions bands at 1787 and 1720 cm–1 assigned
to asymmetric and symmetric stretching of imide carbonyl groups, respectively.
Another band at 1374 cm–1 due to C–N bond
stretching further confirmed the formation of imide linkages. No peaks
corresponding to polyamic acid were observed, indicating complete
imidization. Gel permeation chromatographic measurements showed that
the polyimides were prepared in high weight-average molecular weights Mw in the range of 122,000–192,000 g mol–1 and with narrow polydispersity index (Mw/Mn) in the range of 1.4–1.6
(Table 1).

temperature.

Aromatic polyimides
derived from rigid planar dianhydrides such as pyromellitic dianhydride
(PMDA) and 1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (NTDA) generally
show poor solubility in common organic solvents because of π–π
stacking of polymer chains, which results in strong interchain interactions. To
improve their solubility, polyimides made from PMDA with nonplanar
bulky diamines have shown significantly improved solubility.46,60 The TMDAT-derived PIM-PIs, including PMDA-TMDAT and NTDA-TMDAT,
also displayed very good solubility in low- and high-boiling point
organic solvents (Table S1) because of
the nonplanarity of the 3D-paddlewheel triptycene architecture and
the effect of the sterically restricted tetra-o-methyl
substituents on the C–N–imide bond rotation. The thermal
properties of the polymers were evaluated by TGA, demonstrating excellent
thermal stability with onset decomposition temperatures between 450
and 510 °C in a N2 atmosphere (Figure 4, Table 1).

Figure 4 Thermal gravimetric analysis of TMDAT-based polyimides
under a N2 atmosphere.

The microporosity of the TMDAT-based polyimides was evaluated
by nitrogen adsorption analysis measured at −196 °C up
to 1 bar (Figure 5).
As previously demonstrated for other PIM-PIs, the introduction of
sterically hindered o-methyl substituents to the
imide linkages increased chain rigidity and reduced efficient chain
packing.37−39,46,51 All TMDAT-derived polyimides exhibited very high BET surface areas
ranging from 610 to 850 m2 g–1 (Table 1), which rank among
the highest values reported for PIM-PIs to date.

Figure 5 N2 adsorption
isotherms of TMDAT-derived PIM-PIs measured at −196 °C
up to 1 bar.

The pore size distributions
of the TMDAT-based polyimides derived by NLDFT from nitrogen adsorption
isotherms measured at −196 °C are shown in Figure S3. The estimated pore sizes range between
∼5 and 7.5 Å, as typically observed for PIM-PIs. The general
trend of the pore size distributions of all polyimides is similar,
which correlates qualitatively with their similar gas-pair selectivities
for fresh film samples, as discussed below.

2.3 Gas Permeation
Properties of PIM-PIs
Pure-gas permeabilities and ideal gas-pair
selectivities for 1 day old samples of TMDAT-derived PIM-PIs measured
at 2 bar and 35 °C are shown in Table 2. It is well known that the gas transport
properties of microporous polymers strongly depend on film preparation,
film thickness, drying, and aging conditions.62 Therefore, in this work, all polyimide films were made by the same
methodology including a methanol treatment after an initial drying
step to remove any residual casting solvent that has proven useful
in obtaining reproducible gas permeation properties for fresh samples.
The TMDAT-based polyimides showed high gas permeabilities and moderate
gas-pair selectivities regardless of the dianhydride type. For example,
fresh PIM-PI samples made from TMDAT and conventional dianhydrides,
6FDA-TMDAT and PMDA-TMDAT, displayed O2 permeabilities
of 374 and 680 barrer with O2/N2 selectivities
of 3.3 and 3.8, respectively. Notably, the PIM-PI made from the inexpensive
PMDA-derived polyimide exhibited higher gas permeability without sacrificing
selectivity when compared to 6FDA-TMDAT. This trend has also been
demonstrated previously for 6FDA- and PMDA-derived PIM-PIs made from
tetramethyl-substituted Tröger’s base diamine.46 It is interesting to compare the gas permeation
properties of 6FDA-TMDAT with those of the previously reported 6FDA-DAT1,
which was made from 6FDA and 2,6-diaminotriptycene (DAT1).54 6FDA-DAT1 exhibited a much lower BET surface
area of 320 m2 g–1 than 6FDA-TMDAT (620
m2 g–1). Furthermore, 6FDA-DAT-1 displayed
a much lower O2 permeability of 25.4 barrer but higher
O2/N2 selectivity of 5.4 compared to 6FDA-TMDAT
(O2 permeability = 374 barrer and O2/N2 = 3.3). Clearly, the enhanced permeability of 6FDA-TMDAT resulted
from the tetramethyl-substitution that severely restricted the mobility
of the imide linkages, resulting in higher free volume. Unfortunately,
the desirable increase in permeability is coupled with a significant
loss in selectivity, indicating undesirable effects in the pore size
distribution that reduce the size-sieving properties of 6FDA-TMDAT.

Similar
to other high surface area PIM-PIs, the gas permeability of fresh
aromatic TMDAT-derived polyimide films increased in the following
sequence: PN2 < PCH4 < PO2 <
PHe < PH2 < PCO2; the only exception in
this series was the polyimide based on the cycloaliphatic dianhydride,
bicyclo[2.2.2]oct-7-ene-2,3,5,6-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (BCDA),
where PH2 > PCO2, indicating a more dominating
size-sieving behavior.

It is well known that the gas transport
properties of microporous glassy polymers typically undergo a physical
aging process during which the polymer free volume decreases with
time because of chain rearrangement to tighter intra- and interchain
packing.62 Consequently, physical aging
leads to reduction in gas permeability as the polymer is slowly approaching
its equilibrium chain configuration. Physical aging of 6FDA-TMDAT
and PMDA-TMDAT films tested after 200 days resulted in ∼25–30%
drop in O2 permeability with only small gain in O2/N2 selectivity. Interestingly, the most permeable PIM-PI
in this series, TPDA-TMPDA, showed the largest relative decrease in
O2 permeability of ∼50% from 1153 to 575 barrer
after 200 days of aging, but O2/N2 selectivity
increased significantly from 3.8 to 4.8. The loss in permeability
with concomitant increase in selectivity is believed to be due to
a relative increase in the fraction of ultramicropores (<7 Å)
relative to larger micropores in TPDA-TMPDA.

The gas permeation
properties of PIM-PIs previously made from other tetramethyl-substituted
diamine building blocks, 2,8-diamino-1,3,7,9-tetramethyl-6H,12H-5,11-methanodibenzo-[b,f][1,5]diazocine (4MTBDA) and 2,3,5,6-tetramethyl-p-phenylene diamine (TMPD), are also listed in Table 2. It is noteworthy
to compare the gas permeation properties of 6FDA- and PMDA-derived
polyimides made from 3D tetramethyl-substituted triptycene and Tröger’s
base diamines. It appears that polyimides made either from triptycene
or Tröger’s base PIM motif diamine building blocks with
the same dianhydride had similarly high permeabilities coupled with
moderate gas-pair selectivity. The effect of diamine building blocks
on gas permeability in PIM-PIs can be further elucidated by comparing
6FDA-TMPD and the two polyimides containing 3D-PIM motifs, 6FDA-TMDAT
and 6FDA-4MTBDA. Clearly, the planar 6FDA-TMPD exhibits about 50%
lower permeability with similar selectivity values compared to the
3D-type triptycene and Tröger’s base polyimides. The
notable exception in this series of tetramethyl-substituted polyimides
(KAUST-PI-1) is based on a previously reported triptycene-based dianhydride
(TPDA) and planar TMPD, which showed an exceptional combination of
gas permeability and gas-pair selectivity because of high intrinsic
microporosity and significant fraction of ultramicroporosity.51

The performance of the TMDAT-based polyimide
series for O2/N2 and H2/N separation
is summarized and compared to other tetramethyl-substituted polyimides
in Figure 6. Clearly,
TPDA-TMPDA is the most promising candidate membrane material with
performance between the 2008 and 2015 O2/N2 and
H2/N2 permeability/selectivity trade-off curves.
On the other hand, although the TMDAT-based polyimides showed very
high CO2 permeability (>1000 barrer), their applicability
for viable CO2/CH4 separation in natural gas
or biogas treatment is unlikely because of their modest pure-gas CO2/CH4 selectivity of <20.

3 Conclusions
In this
study, a series of PIM-PIs was successfully prepared by a conventional
one-step high temperature cycloimidization reaction of a novel, sterically
highly contorted triptycene-based diamine, TMDAT, with five different
dianhydrides (6FDA, PMDA, TPDA, NTDA, and BCDA). The polyimides exhibited
high molecular weight (Mw > 100,000
g mol–1), excellent solubility in organic solvents,
and high thermal stability. Intrinsic microporosity of the polyimides
was demonstrated by high BET surface area values (610–850 m2 g–1). All polymers showed high gas permeabilities
with moderate gas-pair selectivities. Interestingly, the most permeable
polyimide in this series, TPDA–TMDAT, also displayed the highest
gas-pair selectivities with performance located between the 2008 and
2015 permeability/selectivity trade-off curves for O2/N2 and H2/N2 separations.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Potassium
nitrate, m-xylene, acetonitrile, trifluoroacetic
anhydride, hydrazine monohydrate, Pd/C catalyst (10 wt %) isoquinoline,
anthranilic acid, and isopentyl nitrite were obtained from Aldrich
and used as received. PMDA and 6FDA were purchased from Aldrich and
purified by sublimation under vacuum prior to use. Sublimed NTDA and
BCDA were obtained from TCI (America). 9,10-Diisopropyl-triptycene
dianhydride (TPDA) monomer was prepared according to a previously
reported procedure.51m-Cresol was purchased from Aldrich and dried over 4 Å molecular
sieves. All other solvents were obtained from various commercial sources
and used as received.

4.2 Characterization
1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra for all monomers
and polymers were obtained with a Bruker AVANCE-III spectrometer at
a frequency of 400 or 500 MHz in deuterated chloroform (CDCl3) or dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO-d6). FTIR
measurements were performed using a Varian 670-IR FTIR spectrometer.
Single-crystal X-ray data were collected at 140(2) K using a Bruker
D8 Venture diffractometer equipped with a PHOTON 100 CMOS area detector
and a Cu (Kα) source, λ = 2.54 Å. Yellow crystals
of TMDNT suitable for X-ray diffraction were obtained by slow evaporation
from solution in n-hexane/DCM (3:1) after 2 days.
Column chromatography was carried out on silica gel 60A. Molecular
weights (Mw and Mn) of the polymers were determined by gel permeation chromatography
using chloroform (CHCl3) or N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) as eluents (GPC, Viscotek and
Agilent 1200) and polydisperse polystyrene as the external standard.
High-resolution mass spectroscopy (HRMS) was conducted on a Thermo
LC/MS system with LTQ Orbitrap Velos detectors. The onset thermal
decomposition temperatures of the polymers were determined by TGA
(TA Q-5000) under nitrogen flow at a heating rate of 3 °C min–1 from room temperature to 700 °C. The BET surface
area of the polymers was determined by nitrogen adsorption at −196
°C up to 1 bar using Micromeritics ASAP-2020 equipped with micropore
option. Prior to analysis, powder samples were degassed under high
vacuum at 150 °C for 24 h.

4.3 Synthesis
of TMA
TMA was prepared according to the previously reported
procedure by Ellison and Hey.59 To a stirred
mixture of anhydrous m-xylene (200 mL) and AlCl3 (60 g, 0.44 mol) was added DCM (37.6 mL) for a period of
1 h. After heating at 60 °C for 3 h, the temperature was raised
to 80 °C and maintained at this temperature for 5 h. The reaction
mixture was quenched with crushed ice and steam-distilled to remove
excess m-xylene. The residual solid was extracted
with hot ethanol and boiled with charcoal and filtered to give the
desired product in 23% yield. Melting point = 296–298 °C. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 2.48 (s, 6H),
2.76 (s, 6H), 7.11 (s, 2H), 7.56 (s, 2H), 8.16 (s, 1H); 8.47 (s, 1H). 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 19.8, 22.1, 118.8,
124.8, 125.5, 128.4, 129.5, 132.3, 134.4, 134.7. HRMS (ESI) (m/z): calcd for C18H18, 234.1409; found, 234.1403 (M+).

4.4 Synthesis
of TMT
To an ice-cooled anthranilic acid (15.00 g, 36.0 mmol)
solution in ethanol (150 mL) were added concentrated HCl (12.6 mL)
and isopentyl nitrite (31 mL) under stirring. After 15 min, diethyl
ether (200 mL) was added and the reaction mixture was stirred for
additional 15 min. The resulting diazonium salt was then filtered,
washed with ether, and dried in a vacuum aspirator and added in portions
to a hot solution of TMA (4.81 g, 17.83 mmol) in dichloroethane (120
mL) and 1,2-epoxypropane (15 mL). The reaction mixture was refluxed
under a nitrogen atmosphere for 10 h, and the solvent was then removed

4.7 Typical Procedure for the
Synthesis of the Polyimides
In a dry 10 mL reaction tube,
a mixture of the diamine monomer (1.0 mmol) and dianhydride monomer
(1.0 mmol) was stirred in dry m-cresol (4 mL) under
a nitrogen atmosphere for 15 min. After heating to 80 °C, two
drops of isoquinoline were added, and the reaction temperature was
raised gradually to 200 °C and maintained at that temperature
for 2 h under steady flow of nitrogen. During this period, water formed
by the imidization reaction was removed by a stream of nitrogen. After
cooling, the clear and viscous polyimide solution was added dropwise
into stirred methanol, and the resulting fibrous polymer was collected
by filtration, purified by reprecipitation twice from an appropriate
solvent into methanol, and then dried under vacuum at 120 °C
for 20 h.

μm PTFE syringe filter into a flat glass Petri dish. Isotropic
films were obtained by slow evaporation of the solvent at room temperature
(CHCl3) or at 80 °C (DMAc) under flow of a nitrogen
stream. The films were further dried under vacuum at 120 °C and
then soaked in methanol for 24 h, air-dried, and finally post-dried
at 120 °C for 24 h under vacuum. Prior to the gas permeation
tests, TGA experiments were performed to confirm complete solvent
removal from the polymer films. Films with thickness of 50–60
μm were used for gas permeability measurements.

4.14 Gas Permeation Measurements
Pure-gas permeation measurements
were conducted with a custom-designed permeation system using the
constant-volume/variable-pressure method. The pure-gas permeabilities
of He, H2, N2, O2, CH4, and CO2 were measured at 35 °C and 2 bar.
