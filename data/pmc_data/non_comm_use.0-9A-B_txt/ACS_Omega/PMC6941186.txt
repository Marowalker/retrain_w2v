New ether-substituted poly(1,4-phenylene vinylene) (PPV)
derivatives
were synthesized via Horner–Emmons coupling. The structures
of the monomers and the resultant oligomers were confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopies. The molecular weights
of the oligomers were characterized by gel permeation chromatography,
giving the number-average and weight-average molecular weights and
the corresponding polydispersity indices. Measurements of UV–vis
absorption and fluorescence were used to characterize the optical
properties of the oligomers. Estimation of the highest occupied molecular
orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels and
other electrochemical characteristics of the oligomers were investigated
by cyclic voltammetry. Dialkyl and dialkoxy PPV oligomers were also
prepared and characterized following the same instrumental methods
used for the ether-substituted oligomers, providing a known reference
system to judge the performance of the new conjugated oligomers. Devices
were fabricated to analyze the electroluminescent characteristics
of the oligomers in organic light-emitting diodes.

Introduction
Conjugated semiconducting polymers have
been the focus of much
research since the first green electroluminescent (EL) device, generated
from poly(phenylene vinylene) (PPV), was presented.1−5 Since then, many modifications have been made to
improve polymer processability, device efficiency, emission wavelength,
and turn-on voltage.6−10 However, unsubstituted PPV is known to be insoluble and infusible,
and because the oft-cited advantage of polymeric materials over small
molecules in electronic devices is ease of processability, the search
for soluble conjugated polymers has been extensive. Methods to improve
solubility include the introduction of solubilizing side groups on
the PPV structure, introduction of soluble polymers to yield PPV copolymers,
and introduction of flexible blocks.11−15 One of the most common methods used to improve PPV
solubility is the incorporation of solubilizing long alkyl chains—linear,
branched, or alkyl chains with polar functional groups—onto
the phenyl rings, see Figure 1 for examples.16−25 Synthetically, the solubilizing moieties can easily be attached
through a phenoxy precursor. The increased acidity of the phenolic
hydrogen facilitates alkylation of the aromatic ring, opening avenues
for the synthesis of a variety of functionalized PPV derivatives.

Figure 1 Common
PPV derivatives with solubilizing side chains.

Previous research by Lee and co-workers focused
on improving device
lifetime by eliminating the use of electron-donating alkoxy substituents
on the aromatic ring.26 This not only decreases
the oxidation potential by lowering the energy of the highest occupied
molecular orbital (HOMO) but also introduces radical scavenging benzylic
positions associated with the replacement of a solubilizing substituent.
The proposed mechanism of PPV degradation shows singlet oxygen cleaving
the vinyl bonds, reducing the conjugation length, and also introducing
carbonyl defects that have been shown to be fluorescence quenchers.27,28 On the other hand, cleavage of the solubilizing alkyl chains from
the benzylic position does not have a significant impact on the optical
properties of the polymer; cleavage at the benzylic position ensures
that the polymer backbone remains intact, with no change in conjugation
length.

However, in a previous study, removal of the oxygen
atoms attached
to the aromatic ring not only had the expected consequence of producing
a blue shift in the emission spectrum (from orange to green), because
of the replacement of the strong electron-donating oxygen with the
weakly electron-donating alkyl group, but also produced a marked reduction
in solubility from the dialkoxy PPV derivative—poly(2,5-didecyloxy-1,4-phenylene
vinylene) (PDOPV)—to the new dialkyl PPV derivative—poly(2,5-didecyl-1,4-phenylene
vinylene) (PDDPV), Figure 2.25,29 The decrease in solubility complicated
comparisons in device performance because of the inability of PDDPV to form films of adequate thickness. While the oxygen
present in PDOPV is detrimental to device lifetime, it
appears to be necessary for improved device efficiency based on the
role of solubility in device preparation. Apparent from the previous
study, the presence of oxygen, directly attached to the aromatic ring,
significantly affected the optical properties of the polymer. However,
when the solubility-enhancing oxygen was not present, or in a position
to donate electron density through resonance, the optical properties
were less red-shifted, which is more amenable to realizing blue emitters.
Therefore, herein we report the synthesis and characterization of
new PPV derivatives in which the solubilizing chains are varied to
study the effect on performance in organic light-emitting diode (OLED)
devices. Meanwhile, because of the improved performance of the alternating
copolymer poly(2,5-didecyl-p-phenylene vinylene-alt-2,5-didecyloxy-p-phenylene vinylene)
(PDDPV-alt-DOPV) relative to the homopolymers
in a previous study, the alternating copolymer incorporating the new
heptyloxypropyl moiety was also studied.26 The oligomers prepared for this study include poly(2,5-didecyloxy-1,4-phenylene
vinylene) (PDOPV) and poly(2,5-didecyl-1,4-phenylene
vinylene) (PDDPV) and the new PPV derivatives poly(2,5-bis(3-(heptyloxy)propyl)-1,4-phenylene
vinylene) (PHOPPV), poly(2,5-bis(3-(2-butoxyethoxy)propyl)-1,4-phenylene
vinylene) (PBEPPV), poly(2,5-bis(3-(heptyloxy)propyl)-1,4-phenylene
vinylene-alt-2,5-didecyl-1,4-phenylene vinylene)
(PHOP-alt-DDPV), and poly(2,5-bis(3-(heptyloxy)propyl)-1,4-phenylene
vinylene-alt-2,5-didecyloxy-1,4-phenylene vinylene)
(PHOP-alt-DOPV); the molecular structures
of the oligomers used in this study are shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 PPV derivatives targeted
in this study.

The incorporation of oxygen in the alkyl side chains
should enhance
the solubility of the new PPVs, leading to improved processing in
the fabrication of OLED devices. To synthesize the targeted oligomers,
the Horner–Emmons condensation was employed. This technique
has been used to create polymers with no evidence of saturated defects,
as can be seen with the Gilch polymerization.30 Irregularities introduced in the polymer reduce the conjugation
length and diminish the device efficiency by acting as charge traps.31,32 In addition, unlike the Wittig reaction, the Horner–Emmons
condensation has been shown to produce no cis-defects, which can also
reduce charge transfer by limiting conjugation.33 Furthermore, unlike the Heck coupling or acyclic diene
metathesis (ADMET) polymerization, the Horner–Emmons condensation
does not rely on expensive metal catalysts.34,35

Poly(2,5-bis(3-(heptyloxy)propyl)-1,4-phenylene vinylene) (PHOPPV)
The dialdehyde 11 (0.1250 g,
0.2799 mmol), the diphosphonate 13 (0.1930 g, 0.2799
mmol), and potassium t-butoxide (0.1568 g, 1.397
mmol) were added to a 25 mL two-neck round-bottomed flask with a condenser
that had been flame-dried, flushed with N2 gas, and wrapped
in aluminum foil. Anhydrous DMF (18 mL, purged 20 min with N2 gas) was added via a syringe. The solution was stirred at 80 °C
for 12 h and then cooled to rt. Methanol (24 mL) was added to precipitate
the product. After transferring to a centrifuge tube, the suspension
was chilled to promote precipitation. The sample was centrifuged and
the supernatant was discarded. After adding a minimal amount of THF,
additional reprecipitations were carried out using methanol (twice),
isopropanol, and pentane. After vacuum-drying, the product was obtained
as a yellow-green solid (0.0241 g, 19%). 1H NMR (500 MHz,

Results and Discussion
Monomer and Oligomer Synthesis
As outlined in Schemes 1, 2, 3 and detailed in the Experimental Section, the Horner–Emmons polycondensation
was carried out in DMF to accomplish the polymerizations. All the
investigated oligomers were isolated in modest yields with those formed
from alkyl substituents as yellow-green solids and those including
alkoxy substituents as red solids. The anticipated chemical structures
of the oligomers were verified by analysis of their 1H
NMR spectra (Figures S1–S6).

For the synthesis of the diether precursors, our initial approach
was to use the same Kumada coupling used to obtain didecylbenzene
in the synthesis of PDDPV.42 However, coupling of the ether side chains onto 1,4-dichlorobenzene
failed, and thus, the route seen in Scheme 1 was then developed to obtain the dibromobenzene,
intermediate 5, used in the synthesis of both diether
precursors to PHOPPV and PBEPPV in good
yield. While the purification of the dibromobenzene with the ether
side chains (6) in Scheme 1 was achieved in moderate yields, the route outlined
in Scheme 2 was more
successful for the PBEPPV precursors, with substituents
bearing two oxygen atoms. The increased solubility of PBEPPV contributed to low yields in the polymerization step as significant
portions of the product failed to precipitate during the purification
process. Even with two glycol-like moieties per repeat unit, PBEPPV still remained insoluble in water, a necessary characteristic
for purification methods as well as for future device fabrication.
Additionally, the 1H NMR spectra for this series of oligomers/co-oligomers
confirmed that the Horner–Emmons route led to PPV derivatives
with no saturated defects.30,32,43 While derivatives with benzylic hydrogens exhibit peaks below 3.0
ppm, and the hydrogens adjacent to oxygen are observed above 3.3 ppm,
no saturated defects were observed at 3.1 ppm in the PPV oligomers
prepared here (please see the 1H NMR spectra in Figures S1–S4),30 which is consistent with other reported syntheses of PPV derivatives
using Horner–Emmons methods.32,43 We also note
that a reduced signal-to-noise ratio was observed for PDDPV and to a lesser extent for PHOP-DDPV because of reduced
solubility of the PDDV-containing derivatives; however,
all other derivatives were readily soluble when analyzed by 1H NMR spectroscopy.

Molecular Weight Measurements
The number-average molecular
weight (Mn), the weight-average molecular
weight (Mw), and the polydispersity index
(PDI) are shown in Table 1.

b PDI = Mw/Mn.

c DP = number of monomer
units per

Because the oligomers were all synthesized under similar
reaction
conditions, the resultant molecular weights and PDIs are similar. PDDPV, the only oligomer in this series produced without oxygen
incorporated in its side chains, produced oligomer chains with the
highest degree of polymerization (DP). It is possible that with varying
reaction conditions, such as time and concentration, larger molecular
weights could be obtained for the more soluble oligomers.44 The poor solubility of the oligomers is also
a contributing factor to the low molecular weights obtained. Both PDDPV and PDOPV precipitated during the course
of the reaction; however, the other derivatives, PHOPPV, PBEPPV, PHOP-alt-DOPV, and PHOP-alt-DDPV, precipitated upon
cooling in methanol. Limitations associated with the gel permeation
chromatography (GPC) equipment used in this study also complicate
the analysis of the results. The GPC sample preparation methods necessitated
multiple filtrations, which only allowed lower molecular weight chains
to be analyzed. Regardless, for the current set of polymers, all degrees
of polymerization exceed the estimated theoretical limit for delocalization
of excitons; therefore, the optical properties should be unaffected
by chain length.45

Absorption and Photoluminescence Spectra
The optical
properties of the oligomers were measured for dilute solutions in
THF and for thin films spin-coated onto quartz slides and are shown
in Figures 3 and 4, respectively; a summary of the optical properties
with numerical values is given in Table 2. The absorbance maxima in solution for PDDPV, PHOPPV, PBEPPV, and PHOP-alt-DDPV are all similar: 408, 410,
415, and 410 nm, respectively (see Figure 3). A similar trend is also observed for the
spin-coated quartz slides, 385, 390, 400, and 375 nm, respectively.
The similarity in the absorbance maxima for the aforementioned oligomers
can be attributed to the nature of the alkyl linkage at the aromatic
ring for the substituent chains. The slight red shift observed for PBEPPV in solution could be attributed to a more rodlike structure
from improved solvation of the chains.46 In contrast to all other oligomers, PDOPV exhibited
a red shift in the solid state (485 nm) compared to solution (472
nm). This difference can perhaps be attributed to the presence of
multiple strong electron-donating alkoxy groups in PDOPV and/or interactions of the multiple phenoxy moieties in PDOPV with the THF solvent and/or additional ordering of PDOPV in the solid state, which has been observed for certain organic
semiconductors.47

exhibited a slight red shift in the film PL spectra (see Figures 3 and 4), compared to the solution-based samples, because of increased
interchain interactions.49 The optical
properties for this set of oligomers and co-oligomers are summarized
in Table 2, including
the PL quantum yields (QYs). From all of the homo-oligomer derivatives, PDOPV exhibited the lowest QY, 34%, while PHOPPV exhibited the highest, 74%. Incorporation of the PHOPPV unit in the investigated co-oligomers led to a higher QY than the
other oligomers with alkyl linkages, PDDPV (57%), PDOPV (34%), and PBEPPV (56%). In the alternating
co-oligomers (PHOP-alt-DDPV and PHOP-alt-DOPV), the QY was improved significantly
relative to the homo-oligomers without the heptyloxypropyl moiety
(PDDPV and PDOPV). The higher QY values
observed for derivatives containing the heptyloxypropyl moiety can
plausibly be attributed to a reduction in the coiled nature of the
pendant side chains in these derivatives, leading to an increase in
their intrinsic persistence length.50

Electrochemical Properties
Cyclic voltammetry (CV)
is widely used in studying the electrochemical behavior of the investigated
compounds. The HOMO and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO)
of the conjugated oligomers were estimated using methods from the
literature to verify oligomer compatibility with device structures.51 The onset oxidation measured from thin-film
cyclic voltammograms was used to estimate the HOMO, eq 1. Using the low-energy edge of the
absorption spectra to calculate the band gap (Eg), eq 2, it is
also simple to estimate the LUMO, eq 3. 1   2   3  

Eoxd,1 is
the first oxidation potential, which was obtained by CV from the oligomer
thin film on a glassy carbon working electrode. Eoxd,ferrocene is the onset oxidation potential of ferrocene
(0.40 V vs Ag/AgNO3) and was determined by CV in a 0.1
M solution of tetrabutylammonium perchlorate in acetonitrile. Eg is the energy band gap estimated from the
low-energy edge of the absorption spectra from the oligomer thin film.
A summary of the electronic properties is shown in Table 3. The energy band gaps of the
investigated oligomers are similar, ranging from 2.20 to 2.61 eV.
The data of PHOP-alt-DOPV, PDDPV, and PDOPV are consistent with values from the previous
research.26 While the absence of oxygen
in PDDPV increased the band gap relative to PDOPV, moving it to the δ position achieved the same result in PHOPPV, PEBEPV, and PHOP-alt-DDPV.

Device Studies
The OLED energy diagram shown in Figure 5 is a representative
example of the devices fabricated for this report. The design consists
of a glass substrate patterned with an indium tin oxide (ITO) anode,
followed by a conducting layer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)
poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and then the emissive layer (active
layer). Using thermal evaporation, tris(8-hydroxyquinolinato)-aluminum
(Alq3), an electron transport layer, and a thin electron
injection layer of lithium fluoride (LiF) were deposited prior to
the aluminum (Al) cathode.52 The organic
component (e.g., PDDPV) is utilized for the emissive
layer. Conducting polymers often exhibit higher hole mobility caused
by increased HOMO overlap, necessitating electron transport layers
(e.g., Alq3) to allow recombination of hole–electron
pairs (excitons) to occur in the emissive layer. Energy is released
in the form of photons at a wavelength corresponding to the band gap
of the emissive material.53 While the characteristics
of the polymer are critical to device performance, the effectiveness
of the device is also dependent on designing an architecture that
has a good band gap overlap between layers.6

Figure 5 Energy
diagram depicting the relative position of the band gaps
for the components of an OLED device representative of those fabricated
in this report.54

Previous studies showed marked improvement in the
performance of PDOPV and PDDPV devices when
using an electron
injection layer of Alq3.26 Not
only did this promote exciton recombination in the emissive layer
but it also increased efficiency by reducing shorts caused by defects
in the polymer film. Because of low solubility, pinhole defects in
devices without Alq3 caused shorts and pixel burnout. The
electronic properties of the new oligomers are within the range between
those of PDDPV and PDOPV; therefore, Alq3 was used as the electron injection layer in all of the devices.
Based on the above conditions, we designed our device configuration
as: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Oligomer/Alq3 (30 nm)/LiF (8 nm)/Al (80
nm). The properties and performance of the OLED devices fabricated
with the investigated oligomers are shown in Figures 6–8.

The current density–voltage characteristics
and the EL spectra
of the oligomers in the OLED devices are shown in Figure 6. The luminous efficiency and
luminance–voltage characteristics of the OLED devices are shown
in Figure 7. The maximum
EL brightness of each OLED device obtained with the oligomers is summarized
in Table 4. Note that
all of the newly synthesized oligomers and co-oligomers exhibited
improved solubility in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) over PDDPV and PDOPV, allowing for thicker spin-coated films for
the devices. Perhaps because of the solubility advantage, the device
prepared from PHOP-alt-DDPV was able
to outperform the device prepared with PDDPV in EL brightness,
an oligomer with poor solubility characteristics, at 157.7 and 101.0
cd/m2, respectively. The maximum efficiency of 0.230 cd/A,
for the DDPV co-oligomer while modest, was twice that
of the PDDPV homo-oligomer, 0.116 cd/A. Furthermore,
the device produced with the alkoxy-substituted PDOPV oligomer had the best results, 210.0 cd/m2, and a maximum
efficiency of 0.725 cd/A. However, the most soluble oligomer, PBEPPV, produced a device with the lowest brightness, 14.6
cd/m2. While all other samples produced light in a 0.2
cm2 pixel, the PBEPPV device showed only pinpoints
of light within the measured area. It is possible that the increased
polarity of PBEPPV might cause unfavorable interactions
with the ODCB solvent or the underlying PEDOT:PSS layer.16,55,56 Interestingly, although PBEPPV exhibited similar electronic properties to the other
alkyl derivatives, it had a lower turn-on voltage, which allows for
milder operating conditions. As expected, the lower energy PDOPV and DOPV co-oligomer exhibited lower turn-on voltages
because of their smaller band gaps. The PHOPPV and the DDPV co-oligomer exhibited a similar turn-on voltage as PDDPV because they share correspondingly higher band gaps.
The EL maxima are very similar to the film PL maxima and can be seen
with a summary of other EL characteristics in Table 4. The observed broadening of the peaks in
the EL spectra in Figure 6 when compared to the PL spectra in Figures 3 and 4 can plausibly
arise from exciplex emission at the organic solid interface.57

The chromaticity of all fabricated OLED devices is
shown in Figure 8.
The chromaticity
coordinates of each OLED device are also summarized in Table 4. In addition, all of the investigated
oligomers, with the exception of PHOP-alt-DOPV, exhibited similar CIE chromaticity coordinates across the measured
voltage range and efficiency. The co-oligomer PHOP-alt-DDPV also exhibited twice the efficiency of the PDDPV homo-oligomer, with almost identical optical properties. This shows
that the limited performance of PDDPV can be improved
by introducing more soluble side chains. Unfortunately, these preliminary
results do not clearly delineate the role the position or amount of
oxygen atoms present on the side chains has on OLED performance requiring
further investigations to determine parameters affecting film formation.

Conclusions
New poly(p-phenylene vinylene)
derivatives, PHOPPV and PBEPPV, as well
as co-oligomers, PHOP-alt-DDPV and PHOP-alt-DOPV, were synthesized through the
well-known Horner–Emmons
polycondensation procedure. This simple and inexpensive synthetic
route afforded oligomers with low PDI and of sufficiently high molecular
weight for use in OLED devices. The introduction of oxygen into the
solubilizing alkyl side chains increases the solubility of the oligomers
(i.e., PHOPPV was more soluble than PDDPV). Furthermore, increasing the oxygen content in the side chains
2-fold (i.e., PBEPPV) further increases the solubility
of the oligomer. The optical properties of these new soluble derivatives
were studied using UV–visible absorption and fluorescence emission
spectroscopy. The nearly identical optical properties of the oligomers,
where oxygen is not attached directly to the ring, were expected because
of the inability of the oxygen to participate in resonance. The synthesized
oligomers demonstrated the capacity to perform color tuning, as demonstrated
by the incorporation of the alkoxy phenylene units in PDOPV and PHOP-alt-DOPV as compared to PHOPPV and the corresponding shift from orange to green as
alkoxy units were reduced or removed from the ring. Considering the
modest performance of the OLED devices, it is clear that solubility
is not the only factor affecting device performance, and film morphology
is not totally dependent on good solubility. The study of the lifetime
of devices prepared from these oligomers is currently in progress.
