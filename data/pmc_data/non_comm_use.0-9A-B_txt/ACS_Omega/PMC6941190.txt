Sn2Fe anode materials were synthesized by
a solvothermal
route, and their electrochemical performance and reaction mechanism
were evaluated. The structural evolution in the first two lithium
cycles was investigated by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), synchrotron
X-ray diffraction (XRD), and magnetic studies. In the first cycle,
progressive alloying of Sn with Li accompanied by metallic iron displacement
occurs upon lithiation, and the delithiation proceeds by LixSn dealloying and recovery of the Sn2Fe phase. In the second cycle, both XRD and XAS identify Li–Sn
alloying at earlier lithiation stages than in the first cycle, with
low-Li-content alloys evident in the beginning of the lithiation process.
In the fully lithiated state, XAS analysis reveals higher coordination
numbers in both the LixSn and Fe phases,
which points toward more complete reaction and higher crystallinity
of the products. Upon second delithiation, the Sn2Fe phase
is generally reformed as evidenced by XRD. However, XAS indicates
somewhat reduced Sn–Fe coordination and shorter Fe–Fe
distance, which indicates incomplete reconversion and metallic Fe
retention, which is also evident in the magnetic studies. Thus, a
combination of long-range (XRD, magnetic) and local (XAS) techniques
has revealed differences between the first and the second Li cycles
relevant to the understanding of the capacity fading mechanisms.

==== Body
Introduction
Lithium-ion batteries have been successfully
applied in various
fields, such as portable electronic devices, medical devices, electric
and hybrid electric vehicles (EV and HEV), and others.1,2 Currently graphite is widely used as an anode for lithium-ion batteries
due to its low cost, stability, and decent cyclability. However, the
low operating voltage of graphite, which is close to the lithium-plating
voltage, potentially causing safety issues,3 and its limited theoretical capacity of 372 mAh/g makes researchers
look for safer and higher capacity anode candidates. Among such candidates
are Si (4200 mAh/g),4,5 Sn (993 mAh/g),6 and Ge (1620 mAh/g).7 A Sn-based
anode is one of the most promising candidates because of its high
capacity, high packing density, and safe working voltage.8 Despite a higher theoretical capacity of the
Sn-based anode as compared with a graphite anode, its practical use
is hindered by the huge volume change (about 260%)9 of Sn during lithiation and delithiation. This volume change
results in the building and destruction of the solid electrolyte interphase
(SEI) layer on each cycle, which, in turn, causes a continuous increase
in the cell impedance and subsequent fast capacity failure.10 Generally, there are two strategies to mitigate
this volume change. One is to downsize the particles to nanoscale,
which helps to release the stress on the particles when the volume
change occurs and, thus, improve the cycling performance.11,12 Downsizing to nanoscale also shortens the lithium diffusion path.13 However, associated issues such as low tap density,
high surface reactivity, as well as the flammable or explosive tendency
should not be neglected.14 The other strategy
is to make Sn–M alloys or Sn–M–C composite materials,
in which M can be either electrochemically active or inactive, such
as Fe,15−19 Co,20,21 Mn,22 Ni,23,24 Cu,25−27 Ti,28 and so on.29,30 The M component can act as a matrix to accommodate the volume change
during cycling and hold the integrity of the active material, so that
the capacity retention can be improved. Enhanced electronic conductivity
and prevention of Sn particles’ aggregation are other benefits
of introducing M to form Sn–M or Sn–M–C composites.26,29 The first successful commercialization of a Sn-based anode was in
the SONY Nexelion battery first released in 2004.31 Analysis of the Nexelion Sn anode showed that it contained
an essentially nanosize amorphous CoSn alloy embedded in carbon32 and could deliver a reversible capacity of more
than 500 mAh/g at 1 mA/cm2 for over 30 cycles,33 significantly higher than the 350 mAh/g of graphite-based
anodes. This success reignited interest in related materials as it
is necessary to replace the expensive and toxic Co by other elements.
Therefore, we targeted Sn–Fe-based alloys because Fe is a cost-effective,
earth-abundant, and environmentally benign material, and it does not
react with lithium, hence it can provide an inactive cushion effect.18,19

Among all of the reported Sn–Fe alloys, Sn2Fe
is the most stable Sn-rich phase at room temperature according to
equilibrium binary phase diagrams,34 and
it also exhibits the highest reversible capacity.16 With respect to the reaction mechanism of the Sn2Fe anode, it has been reported that Li–Sn alloys are formed
during lithiation while Fe is being extruded, even though Fe is hard
to be detected.16,35 However, there is a debate for
the delithiation process, for which some researchers claim that Sn2Fe is reformed upon delithiation, while others argue contrarily
that the “liberated” Fe particles remain inert so that
Sn2Fe could not be recreated. For example, Chamas et al.36 claim that the first discharge could be considered
as an irreversible transformation from Sn2Fe into a α-Fe/Li7Sn2 nanocomposite by combining operando Sn Mössbauer
spectroscopy and ex situ magnetic measurements, while the first charge
process is a progressive delithation of Li7Sn2 and a back reaction of poorly lithiated Li–Sn phases with
the iron nanoparticle generated at the first discharge. Yoon and co-workers
propose that Sn2Fe is decomposed and Li4.4Sn
is formed on reaction with lithium; the reaction is reversed during
lithium removal.35 They also point out
that the second cycle is similar to the first cycle by X-ray diffraction
data.35 However, no iron phase was clearly
identified in their results. Mao et al.37,38 claim that
the reaction 8.8Li + Sn2Fe → 2Li4.4Sn
+ Fe occurs during the first discharge, and alloying/dealloying of
Li with Sn was the primary reaction in the subsequent charge–discharge
cycles. They also claim that the “rejected” Fe is inert
so that Sn2Fe could not be reformed during charge.37,38 In another paper, they point out that crystalline Sn or Sn2Fe could not be detected by X-ray diffraction, but a singlet similar
to that of ultrafine Sn2Fe was found in Mössbauer
spectra, which probably lead to the conclusion that Sn2Fe could be reformed during the charging process.15 Moreover, they observe peak shifts of Li4.4Sn
but no iron showing in the diffraction pattern, which is explained
by the small solubility of Fe in the Li–Sn alloy.15 They have also studied the reaction mechanism
of other Sn–Fe alloys such as SnFe and attributed the reason
that liberated Fe was not found to small grain effect or overlapping
with SnFe peaks.16 As for the formation
of Fe during this electrode reaction, Nwokeke and co-workers have
detected superparamagnetic iron (and/or tin-doped iron) nanoparticles
during discharge by both electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and
Mössbauer spectroscopy, which they thought would be preserved
even after the reverse charge process.39

To achieve a comprehensive understanding of the reaction mechanism
of this material, Sn2Fe was prepared solvothermally. The
solvothermal method was chosen due to its low energy consumption and
scalability and to avoid the high-energy ball-milling step necessary
to achieve small particle size in the high-temperature synthesized
alloy, thus eliminating the impurities introduced by the ball-milling
medium. The reaction mechanism of this solvothermally synthesized
Sn2Fe during the first two cycles has been thoroughly investigated
through local and long-range characterization techniques such as X-ray
absorption spectroscopy (XAS), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), and
magnetic studies.

Experimental Section
Sn2Fe was synthesized
via the solvothermal method modified
from a previous report.40 SnCl2 (99%, Sigma-Aldrich) and FeCl3 (anhydrous, Sigma-Aldrich)
with a molar ratio of 2:1 were put into a 125 mL Teflon-lined autoclave
with 80 mL of ethanol. After stirring the as-prepared suspension for
1 h, a sufficient amount of NaBH4 (99%, Fisher Scientific)
was added. The autoclave was then sealed and heated to 200 °C
with a heating rate of 5 °C/min. After keeping at 200 °C
for 20 h, the autoclave was naturally cooled down to room temperature.
The obtained precipitate was washed by deionized water and ethanol
for five times and then dried in the vacuum oven at 80 °C overnight.
To investigate the influence of the precursor’s ratio on the
resulting product as well as the cycling performances, different ratios
(5:1 and 10:1) between SnCl2 and FeCl3 were
used.

The material’s morphology was studied by a Zeiss
Supra 55
VP field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) operating at
5 kV. The phase composition was initially determined by powder X-ray
diffraction (XRD) using a Scintag XDS2000 θ-θ diffractometer
equipped with a Ge(Li) solid-state detector and Cu Kα sealed
tube (λ = 1.54178 Å). The data were collected in the range
of 2θ = 10–80° with a step size of 0.02° while
spinning the sample to minimize preferred orientation.

For the
electrode preparation, 80 wt % active material, 10 wt %
carbon black, and 10 wt % poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) binder
were mixed with an appropriate amount of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone
(NMP) solvent to form a slurry. The obtained slurry was spread onto
the copper foil by a doctor-blade and then dried in the vacuum oven
at 80 °C overnight. The electrodes (each with ∼5 mg of
the active material) were assembled into 2325-type coin cells in a
He-filled glovebox with a lithium foil (Aldrich, thickness 0.38 mm)
as the counter electrodes and Celgard 2400 separator (Hoechst Celanese).
The electrolyte was 1 M lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) dissolved in ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC)
with a volume ratio of 1:1 and 6% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) as
the additive. The electrochemical performance was tested on VMP multichannel
potentiostat (Biologic). The galvanostatic cycling test was performed
at various current density within a voltage range of 0.01–1.5
V. The first cycle was performed at 0.12 mA/cm2, while
the following cycles were at 0.20 mA/cm2. For ex situ electrode
preparation, the cells cycled to different lithiated/delithiated stages
were stopped, and the electrodes loaded with ∼5 mg of actives
materials were taken out. Further sample preparation was all done
in an Ar-filled glovebox. All of the electrochemistry for the ex situ
studies were done using 0.12 mA/cm2 current density.

For synchrotron XRD, the powder samples from as-prepared electrodes
were scraped off, filled in separate capillaries, and characterized
at the beamline 17BM (wavelength 0.728 Å) at Advanced Photon
Source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory (ANL). Data refinement and
analysis was done with General Structure Analysis System (GSAS).41,42

For synchrotron XAS, the as-prepared electrodes were press-sealed
between thin layers of a Kapton film and stored in the glovebox prior
to measurement. The experiments were performed at beamlines X18A,
X18B, X19A at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS), Brookhaven
National Laboratory and 5BM, 20BM at the Advanced Photon Sources of
Argonne National Laboratory. XAS data were collected at both Fe K-edge
(7712 eV) and Sn K-edge (29 200 eV), with the respective metal
foils (Fe and Sn) measured in the reference mode simultaneously for
the X-ray energy calibration and data alignment at each absorption
edge. Data processing and analysis were conducted by using the IFEFFIT
package.43 By using the Athena program,44 all raw spectra were aligned and averaged, which
was followed by normalization and background-removal. For the theoretical
analysis of the extended region of absorption data (EXAFS), the passive
electron reduction factors, So2, were obtained by fits to the
reference foils as 0.77 for Fe and 0.87 for Sn and fixed in the analysis
of the sample. The simultaneous analysis of Fe and Sn K-edges EXAFS
was employed by fitting theoretical FEFF6 signals to the experimental
EXAFS in the r-space. Several parameters describing
the electronic properties (e.g., correction to the photoelectron energy
origin, ΔE) and local structural environment
(coordination numbers (N), bond lengths (R), and mean squared disorder parameter σ2) around absorbing atoms were varied in the fits. Physical reasonable
constraints (RSn–Fe = RFe–Sn and σSn–Fe2 = σFe–Sn2) were applied to accurately associate
the structure information around Fe and Sn.

Magnetic measurements
were performed on electrodes cycled to different
stages. For this experiment, the active materials from the electrodes
at different states of charge were scraped into plastic capsules inside
the glovebox and sealed with vacuum grease to prevent air exposure.
A SQUID magnetometer (Quantum Design MPMS XL-5) was employed to investigate
the magnetic properties using the following protocol. First, the remnant
magnetic field was quenched to less than 3 mOe using the ultralow
field option, the sample was cooled to 2 K, and at that temperature,
the magnetic field of 10 Oe was applied. Zero-field-cooled (ZFC) magnetization
was measured while heating the sample from 2 to 400 K, followed by
field-cooled (FC) magnetization measurements in the same field cooling
of the sample from 400 to 2 K. Magnetization curves were measured
at 2 and 298 K in magnetic fields up to 5 T. The sample was zero-field-cooled
before the magnetization data at 2 K was taken.

Results and Discussion
We have first investigated the
synthesis products obtained with
different precursor ratios as these could lead to phases or composites
with advantageous electrochemical performances. It can be noticed
from the X-ray diffraction patterns (Figure 1a) that when the initial molar ratio between
Sn and Fe is 2:1, mostly Sn2Fe diffraction peaks appear
with a small amount of crystalline impurities. Once the initial molar
ratio of Sn/Fe increases (e.g., from 2:1 to 5:1), the obtained final
product becomes a mixture of Sn and Sn2Fe. The more Sn
in the precursor, the higher the percentage of Sn is found in the
final product (Figure 1a). The precursor ratio also affects the product morphology (Figure 2). Although, all
of the products are composed of primary spherical particles of ∼100
nm in diameter, as the initial Sn/Fe ratio increases from 2:1 to 10:1,
more and more agglomeration occurs through smearing the particles’
boundaries. As for the electrochemical performance, the capacity retention
is found to drop dramatically upon cycling when the excessive Sn is
present (Figure 1b),
which can be associated with the particle agglomeration and with well-known
capacity fading of the pure Sn metal.10,45 Thus, we have
chosen a 2:1 product for further structural investigation.

First, we have taken a high-resolution X-ray diffraction
pattern
at APS beamline 17BM (wavelength = 0.728 Å) and performed Rietveld
refinement (Figure 3). It revealed the expected Sn2Fe phase, space group I4/mcm,
lattice parameters a = 6.532(1) Å, c = 5.321(1) Å, V = 281 Å3,
consistent with previous reports,22 along
with the small amount of the SnFe phase. Also, a small shoulder is
observed at the (130) peak of Sn2Fe (around 20.6°
in Figure 3). SnFe
peaks are expected in this area but do not match exactly with the
shoulder position. The more likely candidate is Fe, the most intense
(011) diffraction peak of which is close to the (130) peak of Sn2Fe.

Thin gray lines represent a group of eight (4 + 4) Sn–Sn distances
of 3.392 and 3.467 Å.

We have performed magnetic studies of the sample
and indeed found
a behavior atypical of Sn2Fe, which is a collinear antiferromagnet
with the Neel temperature TN = 384 K.46,47 In the ordered state, the magnetic moments of the Fe atoms in Sn2Fe are aligned ferromagnetically in the chains running in z-directions (vertical in Figure 3b), but the neighboring chains are aligned
antiferromagnetically, so that no net magnetic moment is expected.
Instead, we found a hysteresis loop typical of ferromagnets, FC and
ZFC curves departed already at 400 K, the highest temperature available
in our system, no signs of antiferromagnetic ordering at 384 K and
susceptibility values significantly exceeding those reported for Sn2Fe (Figure 4). This clearly indicates the presence of a ferromagnetic Fe, since
the other possible phase, SnFe, is antiferromagnetic.48 The amount of Fe estimated from the saturation magnetization
is about 2 wt %, consistent with the size of the shoulder observed
in the high-resolution XRD pattern. Another interesting feature is
the magnetization drop below 4 K observed in FC and ZFC curves for
some samples, which is attributed to the presence of a small amount
of Sn metal undergoing a superconducting transition.49 The presence of both Fe and Sn impurities in the final
product indicates that the formation of Sn2Fe was incomplete,
and small quantities of metals formed by the reduction did not form
the alloy.

The structure of the hydrothermal product was further
investigated
by the X-ray absorption (XAS) technique, through its two modifications,
X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption
fine structure (EXAFS), as these techniques provide local structural
information critical in further reaction mechanism studies. The edge-step
normalized and background-subtracted EXAFS data in the r-space for the pristine material measured at Fe and Sn K-edges is
presented in Figure 5 along with fitting curves. Sn EXAFS shows prominent scattering signals
for up to 4 Å from the Sn scattering center, while Fe EXAFS oscillations
diminish past 3 Å. This is consistent with the Sn2Fe structure, where Sn is surrounded by four Fe atoms at 2.789 Å,
three (1 + 2) Sn atoms at 2.977 and 3.126 Å, and eight (4 + 4)
Sn atoms at 3.392 and 3.467 Å (Figure 3). Fe, on the other hand, is surrounded by
two Fe (at 2.660 Å) and eight Sn (at 2.789 Å) atoms within
3 Å, and the next coordination shell is at more than 4 Å
distance. The best fit performed simultaneously at both edges using
the FEFF6 code shows that the most prominent features of the Sn and
Fe EXAFS data can be adequately described using the coordination distances
mentioned above. For the Sn K-edge EXAFS, an interaction between Sn
and Fe contributes to the first nearest coordination shell (peak “α”),
and the bond distance is calculated to be at 2.770(7) Å (Table 1). The Sn–Sn
bonding at 3.11(2) Å was used to account for the “β”
peak, and a longer Sn–Sn bond (3.43(1) Å) characterizes
the third peak (“γ”) depicted in Sn FT spectra
(Figure 5a). The respective
coordination numbers, in the order of bond length, are found to be
4.1(4), 5(3), and 9(1). In this fit, we did not fix the coordination
numbers to those of Sn2Fe due to the presence of multiple
phases in the sample. Nevertheless, the results agree very well with
the coordination numbers of 4, (1 + 2), and (4 + 4) for the nearest
three coordination shells in the structure of the Sn2Fe
alloy confirming that it is the major phase (Figure 3). Iron–tin interaction dominates
the nearest coordination around the iron, evidenced by the drastic
contrast between calculated coordination numbers: NFe–Sn = 5.5(6) and NFe–Fe = 0.8(6), which agrees well with the 8:2 ratio between Sn and Fe
in the first coordination shell of the Sn2Fe structure.
The fitting results reveal the contractions of the nearest Fe–Fe
(2.62(3) Å) and Fe–Sn (2.770(7) Å) distances relative
to the theoretical ones in the crystalline Sn2Fe (2.660
and 2.789 Å, respectively). Two of the shortest Fe–Fe
distances correspond to the c-lattice parameter in
the Sn2Fe structure, but XRD data does not show contraction
with respect to the reported values. Thus, we attribute the shorter
Fe–Fe distance from EXAFS to the admixture of signals from
Fe and SnFe phases, both with shorter Fe–Fe distances, and
evidenced by XRD. In contrast, the EXAFS-derived first Sn–Sn
bond (3.11(2) Å) is slightly longer, compared to the theoretical
average (∼3.08 Å) in the crystal Sn2Fe, which
may be attributed to the contribution of Sn impurity found in the
magnetic data. Such a multiphase structure is also supported by the
large uncertainty associated with the coordination number, i.e., NSn–Sn = 5(3).

For the reaction mechanism studies, the ex situ samples
at different
lithiation states were taken out of the coin cells stopped at different
voltages as indicated on the cycling curves below in Figure 6. The associated potentials
are listed in Table 2. The first and the second cycles are noticeably different, as a
huge irreversible capacity of about 400 mAh/g is observed in the first
cycle, which is attributed to side reactions. Here, we will compare
the phase evolution in the first and the second cycles.

To reveal the phase changes during Li cycling, high-resolution
synchrotron X-ray diffraction measurements have been carried out at
APS-17BM (wavelength = 0.728 Å) on the ex situ powder samples.
During the first discharge (Li insertion), the peak intensity of Sn2Fe decreases and almost disappears at the full lithiation
stage. Meanwhile, the formation of Li–Sn alloys, which contribute
to the broad peaks at 2θ = ∼11° and ∼18.2°,
is observed (Figure 7a). The XRD patterns also show that the formation of Li–Sn
alloys undergoes a continuous phase-evolution process, progressing
from low-lithium-content (such as LiSn) to high-lithium-content Li–Sn
phases. As shown in Figure 7b, the peak shoulder, which appears around 2θ = 10–10.5°,
keeps increasing upon lithiation and becomes most pronounced in the
fully lithiated state; this shoulder is contributed by the high-lithium-content
Li–Sn phases of Li3.5Sn and Li4.4Sn.
Formation of the Li4.4Sn phase in the first cycle is, however,
questionable, as the irreversible capacity of 400 mAh/g suggests that
the full lithiation may not be achieved. The Li3.5Sn phase
was observed as the first cycle end lithiation product by Chamas et
al. using Mössbauer data.36

Sn2Fe ex situ samples for (a) the first cycle stopped at
different voltages indicated by each curve and (b) it’s expanded
view in which Li–Sn alloys can be clearly seen.

As mentioned in the Introduction section,
although it is commonly believed that the Fe phase should be extruded
from Sn2Fe during the lithiation, a clear XRD evidence
for the Fe formation is still missing, probably because of the small
particle size of Fe as well as the limited resolution of the lab X-ray
diffractometers. Owing to the exceptional high-resolution capability
of synchrotron X-ray diffraction, we can attempt here to find such
XRD evidence in our data. As shown in Figure 8a, the XRD peak at 2θ = 20.6°
attributed to bcc α-Fe splits more noticeably from the nearby
Sn2Fe peak upon lithiation, until it becomes a separate peak at points
E and F. The peak area, which is comparable to that of the shoulder
in the pristine sample and its sharpness, suggests that it most likely
belongs to the inert crystalline iron originally present in the sample.
On the other hand, a broad amorphous background develops in the XRD
pattern between 20 and 22° toward the end of the lithiation,
which might indicate the formation of Fe nanoparticles. Further proofs
of the formation of bcc α-Fe from XAS and magnetic analyses
will be discussed later.

= 0.728 Å) of solvothermal Sn2Fe for (a) the first
lithiation process and (b) the first delithiation process stopped
at different voltages indicated by each curve in which Fe phase can
be clearly seen.

Compared to the commonly accepted lithiation mechanism,
the Sn2Fe’s delithiation process is a subject of
debate, in
which some researchers claim that the Fe particles formed upon lithiation
would remain inert so that Sn2Fe could not be recreated,
while others argue that Sn2Fe could be reproduced upon
delithiation.15,35,36,38,39 Our XRD results
(Figure 7a) show that
the lithium removal process is a continuous phase-evolution dealloying
process: first, high-lithium-content Li–Sn phases of Li3.5Sn and possibly Li4.4Sn are delithiated, associated
with the disappearing of the characteristic peak shoulder at 2θ
= 10–10.5° (sample F to K); second, most remaining Li–Sn
alloys (corresponding to two broad peaks of 2θ = ∼11°
and ∼18.2°) are gone when the delithiation voltage is
over 0.585 V (samples I and J in Figure 7a), and meanwhile the Sn2Fe phase
starts to reform. Finally, in the charged state, the peaks of Sn2Fe are recovered. Rietveld refinement performed at the beginning
and at the end of the cycle, where the amount and crystallinity of
the Sn2Fe phase allow for the lattice parameter determination,
shows only small variations of lattice parameters (Table 3). The peak broadening observed
in cycled samples makes it difficult to determine the lattice parameters
with high precision, therefore local structural details will be revealed
using the XAS technique. Also, as shown in Figure 8b, the broad XRD feature of formed bcc α-Fe
also keeps decreasing upon delithiation, but with a small portion
of Fe being inactive, thus remaining in the final product (notice
the shoulder at 2θ = 20.6° on the XRD pattern of sample
K).

To reveal the local structural details of the first
lithium cycle,we
further studied the samples at the same states of charge as indicated
in Table 2 by the X-ray
absorption spectroscopy technique. The selected edge-step normalized
and background-subtracted EXAFS data in k- and r-spaces
for the samples measured at Fe and Sn K-edges are presented in Figure 9, where the data
for the fully lithiated sample F and fully delithiated sample K obtained
from the first cycle are compared with the pristine sample. The delithiated
sample resembles the pristine material in structure, whereas the atoms
are arranged differently in the lithiated one. This is evidenced by
its distinct EXAFS oscillations in the k-space and
radial distribution structures at each absorption edge. Such findings
confirm that the structural transformation of the pristine material
is mostly reversible upon delithiation. The lower amplitude of FT-EXAFS
peaks exhibited by the delithiated sample, compared with that in the
pristine sample, indicates a reduction of alloy’s particle
size after the first cycle.

Figure 9 EXAFS data for the Sn2Fe anode material
in its pristine,
lithiated, and delithiated forms: (a) Fourier transform (FT) magnitude
of EXAFS spectra K2χ(k) at the Fe K-edge, k ranges 2–10.5 Å–1; (b) Fourier transform (FT) magnitude of EXAFS spectra K2χ(k) at the Sn K-edge, k ranges 1.5–12 Å–1. The inserts
are their respective k-space EXAFS signal χ(k).

A structure involving Sn–Li interaction
was attested the
most suitable model to fit the Sn-edge EXAFS data for the lithiated
sample (Figure 10).
It is found that Sn–Fe, Sn–Sn, and Sn–Li, at
respective distances of 2.69(1)°, 2.92(3)°, and 2.86(5)
Å, contribute to the EXAFS signal at the Sn K-edge. The alloying
of Sn in the lithiated sample is well illustrated by the spectral
difference from that of the Sn foil (Figure 11). The Sn–Li bond, on average slightly
shorter than 2.9 Å, points to a Li–Sn alloy structure
with Li/Sn > 2.5.50,51 The derived coordination numbers
for Sn–Li and Sn–Sn are 6(2) and 1.0 ± 0.5, respectively,
which corresponds well to the LixSn (2.5
< x < 4).50,51

A combination of Fe–Fe and Fe–Sn
bonds was employed
to model the Fe EXAFS data at low-R regions (Figure 10). The Fe–Fe
distance is calculated to be almost equivalent in length to that in
the Fe foil, which is considerably shorter (by ∼0.16 Å)
than Fe–Fe distance in pristine Sn2Fe. This contraction
is also accompanied by a 4-fold increase in the coordination number.
These quantitative evidences confirm the initial observations of Fe
XAS and are in excellent agreement with the XRD-observed formation
of the bcc Fe metal. The resulted Fe–Fe coordination number,
3.9(4), is below the average value (8) for a full first coordination
sphere in the Fe crystal structure, which points toward the small
particle size of the segregated Fe. The average of the heterogeneous
bond between Fe and Sn atoms renders ∼0.08 Å contraction
from its original length in the pristine sample, corroborating the
structure rearrangement involving the transition from tetragonal Sn2Fe to cubic Fe. The breakdown of the Sn–Fe alloy structure
is also demonstrated by the declined coordinations between Fe and
Sn: NFe–Sn =1.6(2) and NSn–Fe = 0.5(4). Interestingly, though
reduced, the contributions of Fe–Sn interaction to the EXAFS
data are essential, hinting the presence of the minor SnyFe phase or close proximity of nano Fe- and Sn-based
phases.

The best-fitting results (Table 1) for the first cycle delithiated sample
K reveals
a slight reduction of the Fe–Sn coordination number and the
considerable shortening of Fe-involved bonds compared to the pristine
material. It is proposed that in the delithiated structure, the core
is dominated by Sn–Fe alloying with somewhat strained geometry
caused by those unrecovered Fe. This irremediable transformation of
the structure is expected as it has been established that the first
cycle usually involves irreversible structure rearrangement or activation.52,53

Table 1 also
shows
that at approximately 50% lithiated stage (cell stopped at 0.12 V
during first cycle lithiation), the respective value of each Fe-based
bond parameter, derived from EXAFS fitting, is in-between of those
in pristine and fully lithiated sample, indicating the gradual transformation
of Fe from the alloyed to the segregated phase in the course of lithiation
intercalation. However, no direct evidence is present to confirm Li–Sn
alloying at this stage while large uncertainties and high correlation
obtained for the coordination numbers and bond disorders for the two
Sn–Sn bonds, averaged at 3.07(4)° and 3.41(3) Å,
respectively, implicating the possibility for Sn to be in mixed phases
of Fe-alloyed Sn and segregated Sn.

Magnetic properties were
studied to further investigate the details
of Fe separation and reconversion back to Sn2Fe in the
first cycle, based on a distinct difference in their magnetic properties.
As was mentioned earlier, Sn2Fe is antiferromagnetic at
room temperature, while Fe is ferromagnetic in bulk and superparamagnetic
if nanosized.46,47,49Figure 12 shows
magnetization curves of lithiated (point F) and delithiated (point
K) Sn2Fe in comparison with that of the pristine sample
(point A). Upon discharge to 0.01 V (point F), magnetization increases
significantly and attains about 1.7 μB/mol. This
value is less than expected for the bulk iron (2.2 μB), which was observed upon lithiation of Sn2Fe by Chamas
et al.36 However, it is consistent with
our EXAFS observation of considerable Sn–Fe bonding in this
sample, indicating incomplete conversion. It is interesting to notice
that the sharp magnetization increase occurs at the very end of the
lithiation process, indicating that Fe displacement from the alloy
proceeds gradually, and the distinct Fe particles are formed only
at the end of discharge. Charge to 1.5 V results in magnetization
decrease, but it still remains a bit higher than that of pristine
Sn2Fe indicating some remaining Fe, which is also consistent
with EXAFS and XRD observations.

Figure 12 (a) Magnetization curves at 2 K and (b)
field-cooled (solid symbols)
and zero-field-cooled (open symbols) temperature dependences of magnetization
of pristine, lithiated to 0.01 V and delithiated to 1.5 V Sn2Fe.

Field-cooled and zero-field-cooled dependences
of magnetization
were also studied as they can indicate formation of superparamagnetic
iron particles and allow determination of their size. Pristine Sn2Fe shows that FC and ZFC curves depart already at 400 K, the
highest temperature available in the experiment. Upon lithiation,
the ZFC curve develops a peak at 18 K in a sample lithiated to point
K, which is attributed to the blocking temperature Tb of superparamagnetic Fe particles. The volume V of iron particles can be estimated from Tb using equation Tb = KV/25kB (K is
the magnetocrystalline energy and kB =
1.38 × 10–16 erg/K is the Boltzmann constant).
Assuming the magnetocrystalline constant K = 4.8
× 105 erg/cm3 of metallic Fe0 and spherical particle shape, the Fe particle diameter is about
6 nm at the end of the lithiation process. It should be noted that
the magnetocrystalline constants up to an order of magnitude higher
were reported for the 2–3 nm Fe particles, which would bring
the particle size down to 3 nm. It is consistent with the Fe particle
size observed by Chamas et al.36 from the
magnetization data and by Mao et al. from the Mössbauer data.54

The FC curve of the delithiated sample
closely resembles that of
the pristine sample; however, ZFC curve still shows a maximum typical
of superparamagnetic Fe particles centered at 100 K, which corresponds
to 5 or 10 nm particles using two different magnetocrystalline constants
mentioned above. This observation is consistent with slightly higher
magnetization found for the delithiated sample in comparison with
the pristine one. Larger Fe particle size in the delithiated sample
points toward Fe particle coarsening during the delithiation process
or indicates that larger Fe particles tend to remain unreacted upon
delithiation.

For the anode materials, it is known that the
first discharge–charge
cycle is often associated with some side reactions such as SEI formation,
cracking of crystallites, materials activation, structure rearrangement,
and so forth. It is evident in the electrochemical data (Figure 6a) as a large irreversible
capacity, which makes it difficult to delineate the Sn2Fe lithiation/delithiation reaction from the SEI formation. Therefore,
to have a comprehensive understanding of the reaction mechanism of
Sn2Fe, high-resolution synchrotron X-ray diffraction measurements
have also been performed on the ex situ powder samples from the second
discharge–charge cycle. As shown in Figure 13, during the second discharge, the transformation
of Sn2Fe to Li–Sn alloys (see the two broad peaks
of 2θ = ∼11° and ∼18.2°) and bcc α-Fe
is similar to that occurring in the first cycle. However, such a phase
transformation mainly occurs as early as at 0.366 V (sample L), which
is much faster compared to the first cycle (the main phase transformation
occurring at 0.125 V (sample C)). This kind of kinetic difference
may be ascribed to the cracking of crystallites or breaking up of
agglomerates after the first cycle, which would allow a better electrolyte
access to the active electrode material and would trigger the conversion
reaction earlier. After the second discharge, a small amount of Sn2Fe still remains in the fully lithiated sample P probably
as the discrete or inactive particles (Figures 13 and S2).

Figure 13 Ex situ synchrotron
XRD patterns (wavelength = 0.728 Å) of
solvothermal Sn2Fe for the second cycle stopped at different
voltages indicated by each curve.

Similar to the first charge, the recovery of most
Sn2Fe as well as the reversible reaction are also observed
during the
second charge process. Interestingly, at the lithiation stages S or
T (above 0.585 V), LiSn, an intermediate state of the Li–Sn
alloys’ evolution, has been clearly captured (Figure 13). This low-lithium-content
alloy is formed when the dealloying process progresses from high-lithium-content
Li–Sn phases (such as Li3.5Sn and Li4.4Sn) to low-lithium-content ones. Different from the first charge,
the Sn2Fe recovery during the second charge does not proceed
so much until the very end of the delithiation; while a clear Sn2Fe formation can be observed starting from the sample I of
the first cycle (Figure 7a). Although most of Sn2Fe can be recovered from the reversible
reaction, a small amount of unreacted Li–Sn alloys as well
as bcc α-Fe can be clearly identified in the final product (after
two cycles), as shown in Figure 13. It is noteworthy that the amount of these unreacted
species increases from the first to the second cycle, which means
that inactive particles of Li–Sn alloys and Fe could be accumulating
from cycle to cycle. This might be the reason why the solvothermally
synthesized Sn2Fe exhibits a bigger capacity fading than
the mechanochemically formed Sn2Fe/Sn/C composite.18,19

A comparative XAS evaluation of the second lithiation/delithiation
process against the first one was conducted, emphasizing that the
structure features at fully lithiated and delithiated stages. Analysis
shows that a good fit of EXAFS data for the lithiated sample can be
achieved also by involving Sn–Li interaction (2.88 ± 0.01
Å), confirming the reformation of LixSn where x is greater than 2.5.50,51 The coordination number of Sn–Li is calculated to be 6.5
± 0.5, comparable to that of the fully lithiated sample in the
first cycle.

However, no Sn–Sn bond is detected within
∼3.0 Å
distant from the central Sn atom, a distinguished difference from
that in the first cycle and also clearly exhibited by FT-EXAFS in Figure 11d. Its absence
and the negligible Sn–Fe bond (0.10 ± 0.09) are taken
as the supporting evidences for complete conversion upon lithiation
in the second cycle to the high-Li-content alloys, for instance, Li4.25Sn or Li4.4Sn, in which the available Sn–Sn
scatterings are expected to appear at R > 4.6
Å.55−57 In addition, the coordination number of the Fe–Fe
bond (5.5
± 1.8) is larger than its first cycle counterpart, reflecting
the growth or aggregation of discrete Fe particles. This more complete
lithiation reaction in the second cycle results in a higher charge
capacity in the second cycle evidenced in Figure 6.

EXAFS examinations for the delithiated
sample for the second cycle
suggest that Sn–Fe alloying is mostly restored as the material
is delithiated. The resemblance of Sn spectral properties of the two
delithiated samples in the first and second cycles and comparable
parameters derived from the fits particularly illustrate the similarity.
On the other hand, a noticeable difference of the second cycle delithiated
sample from that of the first cycle is observed in the Fe–Fe
coordination: a decrease in bond distance and an increase in coordination
number. This finding may hint an elevated concentration of the segregated
Fe phase in the system.

Additionally, the XAFS investigation
of the intermediate phases
of the lithiation process during the second cycling demonstrates a
progressive transformation of structure from mainly the Sn–Fe
alloy to the mixture of Sn–Li alloy and segregated Fe. It suggests
that Sn–Li alloying can be identified at a much earlier stage
of discharge, compared to the first cycle. The Sn–Li bond averaged
at 2.92 ± 0.02 Å is involved in the fitting for Sn EXAFS
data for approximately 20% lithiated sample B (cell stopped at 0.366
V during lithiation). Also, the Sn–Sn bond becomes much shorter
than that in the Sn2Fe alloy or segregated Sn. The resulted
value of 2.98 ± 0.01 Å is consistent with formation of lithiated
Sn, the composition of which is in-between of Li7Sn3 and LiSn.50,51

Conclusions
Sn–Fe anode materials with various
ratios (2:1, 5:1, and
10:1) were synthesized successfully via solvothermal route; among
them, 2:1 product of mainly the Sn2Fe phase delivers better
electrochemical performance than Sn2Fe/Sn. A combination
of XRD, XAS, and magnetic studies has revealed Li–Sn alloying
and metallic iron formation during the first lithiation. XAS and magnetic
data suggest a small Fe particle size (about 3 nm from the magnetic
properties) and incomplete conversion. The first delithiation proceeds
by LixSn dealloying and Sn2Fe alloy reformation, indicating that the conversion reaction is
generally reversible. Magnetic studies show that some Fe particles
of a larger size (5–10 nm) remain after the first charge. In
the second lithiation, earlier formation of LixSn alloys and more complete conversion is evidenced; however,
upon delithiation, the unreacted Fe accumulation continues, as indicated
by shorter Fe–Fe distances, approaching those of metallic Fe.
Such coarsening, observed also by Mao et al. using the Mössbauer
technique,54 might be a critical factor
contributing to the capacity loss upon cycling. One of the ways to
prevent this coarsening could be by creation of composites with even
smaller, uniform-sized particles, as we have recently demonstrated.58 Based on our data and analysis of the reaction
mechanisms reported in the literature, we believe that the differences
in the reaction mechanism are caused by differences in particle size,
morphology, conductive additives, and other details affecting the
material’s ability to undergo the reversible conversion.
