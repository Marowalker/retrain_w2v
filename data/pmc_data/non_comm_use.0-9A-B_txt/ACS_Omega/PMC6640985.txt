Monoclinic
vanadium(IV) oxide (VO2) has been widely
studied for energy-efficient glazing applications because of its thermochromic
properties, displaying a large change in transmission of near-IR wavelengths
between the hot and cold states. The optimization of the reaction
between VCl4 and ethyl acetate via atmospheric-pressure
chemical vapor deposition (APCVD) was shown to produce thin films
of monoclinic VO2 with excellent thermochromic properties
(ΔTsol = 12%). The tailoring of
the thermochromic and visible light transmission was shown to be possible
by altering the density and morphology of the deposited films. The
films were characterized by X-ray diffraction, atomic-force microscopy,
scanning electron microscopy, ellipsometry, and UV–vis spectrometry.
This article provides useful design rules for the synthesis of high-quality
VO2 thin films by APCVD.

Introduction
Climate change is one
of the major challenges for humankind to
overcome in the near future. Over the last 40 years, a rapid increase
of the average global temperature has been observed. This can be seen
through the intensification of extreme weather events, melting of
glaciers and sea-level rise,1 with consequences
on food and water supply, as well as human health.2 In March 2016, it was approximately 1.5 °C above the
preindustrial era average temperature.3 This correlates with the increase of the total anthropogenic greenhouse
gas emissions, which has risen by 61% during the same period.4 In addition to finding alternative sources of
energy, this has also led to a greater focus on energy efficiency
and overall energy consumption. The building sector is an area that
can deliver large reductions in energy consumption as it has been
estimated to contribute up to a third of annual greenhouse gas emissions.
This is mainly due to heating and cooling demands, as well as lighting.5 As windows are responsible for a significant
amount of the energy loss from buildings, a promising approach to
improve the energy efficiency of buildings is the use of intelligent coatings on glazing surfaces. Thermochromic thin films are an example
of one such intelligent coating and can play an important
role in the area of energy-efficient glazing. They display a reversible
change in near-infrared (NIR) reflectivity in response to temperature.6

Monoclinic VO2 has been widely
studied for energy-efficient
glazing applications because of its thermochromic properties. At the
critical temperature (Tc) of ca. 68 °C,
a reversible metal-to-semiconductor transition (MST) occurs.7 That is, from the semiconducting monoclinic phase
(VO2(M)) to the semimetallic rutile phase (VO2(R)).8 This transition involves changes
in optical properties in the NIR region as well as a large change
in electrical conductivity.9 VO2 thin films can be synthesized through different techniques such
as magnetron sputtering,10,11 pulsed laser deposition,12 chemical vapor deposition (CVD),13 and sol–gel processes.14 This article reports on the use of atmospheric-pressure
CVD (APCVD), which is a large-scale production process currently used
to deposit functional coatings in industrial processes (e.g., self-cleaning
coating Pilkington Activ). For VO2 to be used for energy-efficient
glazing, visible light transmittance (Tlum) and solar modulation (ΔTsol)
are the two major parameters that need improvement. Unfortunately,
optimizing both Tlum and ΔTsol in the same film has proven challenging,
with thin films displaying high visible light transmission but poor
solar modulation and thick films displaying the opposite trend. Optical
models have been designed for improving thermochromic properties of
VO2. These models have shown that the ideal thickness should
be between 60 and 100 nm to keep an acceptable visible light transmittance
while maintaining reasonable solar modulation values.15 The density of the deposited films is also an important
consideration. Films with a high density can show better ΔTsol because of a higher electron mobility and
also present fewer defects, resulting in a decrease of incident light
scattering and a higher Tlum.(16) Both the growth rate and film density may be
influenced by having a fine control over the temperature and flow
rate of the precursors in APCVD. This is particularly achievable when
using highly volatile precursors, and their selection is thus crucial
for a high performance of thermochromic coatings.

Several precursors
have been used for the growth of VO2 thin films on glass
substrates via APCVD. VOCl3 has been
shown to produce monoclinic VO2 when reacted with water.
However, this process requires high reactor temperatures (above 600
°C). Below this temperature, or with an excess of VOCl3, undesirable V2O5 is produced.17 VO(iOPr)3 has been used as a single
precursor in APCVD.18 Although it lowers
the deposition temperature required to achieve monoclinic VO2 (450 °C), the slow growth rate of 8 nm min–1 is not convenient for large-scale processes. A number of studies
also related VO(acac)2 and VCl4 as precursors
for growing VO2 thin films by reaction with water.14 A comparative study9 investigated both precursors for depositing thin films of VO2 by APCVD. These authors found that the films deposited from
VO(acac)2 showed a greater change in NIR reflectivity between
the hot and cold states. However, deposition with VO(acac)2 is a complex system, which may lead to undesired byproducts. In
addition, it is not a convenient precursor for APCVD because of its
low vapor pressure. VCl4 was found to be a suitable simple
precursor with a relatively high vapor pressure. However, so far,
the deposition of VO2 films from VCl4 has been
carried out using water as the oxygen source. VCl4 is highly
reactive with water, resulting in inhomogeneous or highly porous VO2 films, which may have an impact on the optical properties
of the deposited films.19 In the current
work, the synthesis of homogeneous thermochromic VO2 thin
films was carried out from VCl4 and ethyl acetate (EtAc)
using APCVD. We show here that EtAc is an excellent oxygen precursor
because of its high vapor pressure and clean reaction with VCl4, resulting in the formation of smooth, homogeneous thin films.
The VCl4/EtAc system was optimized, allowing for precise
control over both the film growth rate and porosity of the deposited
films. This research is an important step toward the development of
high-performance thermochromic coatings from APCVD processes.

Results
and Discussion
Thin Film Synthesis and Characterization
Monoclinic
VO2 thin films were deposited onto floating glass substrates
via APCVD from the reaction between VCl4 and EtAc. The
molar flow ratio was 2:1, VCl4/EtAc, and the deposition
temperature was kept constant at 550 °C. Below this temperature,
the resulting VO2 films showed high carbon contamination
and were poorly crystalline, which had a drastic impact on their thermochromic
properties. Nitrogen was introduced into the mixing chamber via heated
stainless steel pipes, called the plain line. The total volume flow
rate of the plain line was fixed at 23.2 L min–1. This flow rate was found to be critical in our system: a higher
flow rate (24.9 L min–1) led to nonhomogeneous films,
whereas a lower one (21.6 L min–1) produced films
with poor surface coverage and poor solar modulation. Considering
this, a series of four samples of VO2(M) were synthesized
under different deposition times and molar flow rates, as shown Table 1. All of the samples
synthesized had a gold-brown color and passed the Scotch tape test.
The films were stored in air and showed good stability over a period
of several months (as assessed by UV–vis). They were also resistant
to common solvents such as acetone, methanol, and ethanol.

°C. All of the depositions were carried out under a total volume
flow rate of nitrogen of 23.2 L min–1.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis
confirmed the presence of monoclinic
VO2 phase, with preferential orientation along the (011)
plane (Figure 1). Sample
D showed weak diffraction peaks compared to those of the other films. As both samples B and D had comparable
thicknesses, the poorly defined pattern of sample D suggests that
it had comparatively poor crystallinity.

Figure 1 XRD patterns of single
VO2 films of different thicknesses:
(A) 177, (B) 65.5, (C) 124.6, and (D) 72.2 nm.

The chemical environments and oxidation state of vanadium
were
investigated by XPS. The V2p3/2 core-level peak (Figure 2) showed the presence
of two oxidation states of vanadium at the surface, V4+ and V5+, at the binding energies of 515.9 and 517.3 eV,
respectively. The VO2 thin films showed a slight oxidation
(presence of V2O5) at the extreme surface (few
nanometers) because of the direct contact of the thin films with air
(XPS analysis was carried out on samples stored for several months
in air at room temperature). However, compared to the films prepared
previously using APCVD, those presented in this study
showed a greater proportion of V4+ at the surface as the
major contribution to the V2p3/2 peak was from V4+ (V4+/V5+ ratio was 60:40). This highlighted
the good chemical stability of the VO2 thin films. Although
in situ Ar ion etching is often used to remove surface layers, it
is known to cause significant changes in the vanadium oxidation state
in vanadium oxides.21 Therefore, etching
cannot be used here to measure the bulk vanadium oxidation state.
The binding energies at 529.9 eV in O1s signal were attributed to
V—O bonds. The O1s spectra also showed the presence of carbon
(C—O bonds) at the binding energy of 531.9 eV. This is likely
due to the use of EtAc as the oxygen source. Finally, the binding
energy of 533.3 eV was assigned to Si—O bonds. The silicon
came from the SiO2 barrier layer, suggesting the presence
of pinholes into the thin films. These binding energies are in accordance
with those reported in the literature.22,23

spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of VO2 thin films. The V4+/V5+ ratio at surface thin
films was 60:40.

The surface morphology
and microstructure of the films were characterized
by SEM and atomic-force microscopy (AFM). SEM images of the samples
displayed a uniform morphology with high surface coverage (Figure 3). However, the microstructure
of the films was clearly different as function of the molar flow rate
(μ). Samples A and B, deposited at relatively high molar flow
rates (μVCl4 = 5 × 10–3 mol min–1 and μEtAc = 3 ×
10–3 mol min–1), showed agglomerated
round particles, whereas low molar flow rates (μVCl4 = 1 × 10–3 mol min–1 and μEtAc = 0.5 × 10–3 mol
min–1) produced elongated particles, as seen in
samples C and D. The particle growth in the four films was inferred
from the different molar flow regimes used. We found that the particle
sizes were comparable within short deposition times (0.5–1
min) under the high flow regime (samples A and B). However, in the
low molar flow regime, there was a clear difference between the samples
deposited at 1 (sample D) and 2 min (sample C), with particles in
sample D being significantly smaller, likely due to the lack of available
precursor.

Further morphology analysis was carried out using
AFM. The three-dimensional
(3D) AFM study (Figure 4) of the four VO2 films correlated well with the SEM observations.
The average surface roughness (root-mean-square, RMS) increased upon
increasing the thickness of the films. This suggests that the surface
roughness of a deposited film can be tailored by controlling the molar
flow rate and deposition time within the flow-rate regimes used in
this work. Sample A showed significant roughness (RRMS = 22 nm) compared to that of the other films (Table 2). Instead, samples
B and D showed relatively smooth surfaces with average roughness similar
to that of a single VO2 layer of 125 nm deposited by magnetron
sputtering (RRMS ∼ 12 nm).24

Thermochromic Properties of the Optimized
VO2 Films
The thermochromic and optical properties
of the VO2 thin
films were measured by recording the transmittance spectra in the
UV–vis–IR regions in the range of 20–90 °C
(Figure 5). All samples
showed a reversible switch occurring at ∼68 °C, which
is the typical temperature shown for undoped VO2. The data
from each spectrum was used to calculate the solar modulation of each
sample (Table 3). For
all samples, the solar modulation (Tsol) and the integral luminous transmittance (Tlum) were obtained on the basis of the spectra measured using
the following equation  where λ is the wavelength of light,
ϕlum is the weighted visible light human eye, ϕsol is the weighted solar irradiance spectrum,
and Tσ is the transmission of the
VO2 thin film in either the hot state or the cold state.

As a first observation of Table 3, the results can be split into two categories
according
to the synthesis conditions.

High Molar Flow Rate Regime (μVCl4 = 5 × 10–3 mol min–1 and
μEtAc = 3 × 10–3 mol min–1)
Samples A and B showed similar solar modulations,
around 12%. They also had the same large switch (around 52%) between
the cold and the hot state at 2500 nm. The difference between the
thicknesses of samples A and B did not affect ΔTsol. However, there was an impact on their visible light
transmittance (Tlum), which was higher
for the thinnest thin VO2 film, sample B, as expected.

Low Molar Flow Rate Regime (μVCl4 = 1
× 10–3 mol min–1 and
μEtAc = 0.5 × 10–3 mol min–1)
Sample C showed a ΔTsol around 12%, with a large switch of 58% difference
at 2500 nm. Sample D presented a ΔTsol around 7.8%, with a switch of 41% at 2500 nm. Sample D showed the
smallest change in transmission in this work. However, its switch
is in accordance with those reported in the literature. For instance,
VO2 thin films synthesized via APCVD using VCl4 and water as precursors showed a switch of 35% at 2500 nm.25 At this molar flow rate, the thickness had a
negative impact on ΔTsol. This could
be explained by the crystallinity of sample D. XRD patterns showed
low crystallinity, which could reduce the thermochromic performance.
On the other hand, the thinnest thin film, sample D, showed the highest Tlum.

Overall, all samples showed good
thermochromic properties with similar ΔTsol. Although sample D had the lowest ΔTsol, it still showed good thermochromic performance. All
of the solar modulations estimated here (7.8–12%) are in line
with those of typical VO2 thin films synthesized using
other techniques, such as magnetron sputtering or spin-coating (Table 4). The thermochromic
performance, in terms of solar modulation, of films from magnetron
sputtering ranged between 6 and 13.4% (Table 4).26−30 Similarly, VO2 thin films deposited by spin-coating showed
solar modulations between 6.4 and 18.6%.31,32 The same thin film process, APCVD, for a higher thickness, around
300 nm, showed a lower solar modulation and visible light transmission,
3.1 and 14 (cold state) and 16 (hot state), respectively.33 Also, it is important to keep in mind that optical
modulations for VO2 (finite-difference time-domain simulations)
showed that the highest solar modulation reached for a single VO2 layer synthesized by APCVD was ΔTsol ∼ 15%;15 thus, our system
is close to the theoretical limits.

For comparison, several data from the literature were gathered
in Table 4. They showed
the thermochromic properties of VO2 thin films deposited
by various methods.

Visible light transmission was dependent
on film thickness for
samples deposited using the same molar flow rates. This can be seen
when comparing samples A and B, where upon increasing thickness, the
visible light transmission decreased. For a better overview of visible
light transmittance, an illustration of sample B is shown in Figure 6 and compared with
a commercial window. However, this was not the case when comparing
the samples deposited using different molar flow rates but with similar
thicknesses, such as B (65 nm) and D (72 nm). Here, it appeared that
sample D had a better Tlum despite being
thicker than sample B. The AFM data showed similar RMS for both samples
(Table 2). However,
the 3D AFM scans and SEM images showed difference between the morphologies
of the two samples. Sample D had more elongated particle shapes and a less compact
surface. Although they had similar thicknesses, the average size of
the particles for these two samples was very different. Sample B had
an average particle size of ca. 143 nm, whereas sample D showed average
particle size of ca. 30 nm.
Zhou et al.34 demonstrated that for VO2 particle sizes below 50 nm the light scattering was very
weak, with visible wavelengths only interacting poorly with the VO2 particles. This resulted in higher visible light transmission.
Conversely, the light scattering increased with particle size. Therefore,
the higher visible light transmittance observed in sample D could
be due to a weaker light scattering than that for sample B.

As a result, VO2 thin film with a certain thickness
and morphology (sample D) was obtained. The sample displayed a high
visible light transmittance, 47 and 51% in cold and hot states, respectively,
while maintaining a good solar modulation. As seen in Table 4, Tlum of sample D is higher than Tlum of VO2 thin films deposited by magnetron sputtering, with similar
ΔTsol. Magnetron sputtering is an
expensive thin film deposition process that requires low pressure
and low growth rate. Considering this, this article showed the experimental
conditions to synthesize VO2 thin films that displayed
good thermochromic properties and high visible light transmittance
with a cheaper thin film deposition technique (APCVD) and commercial
precursors and at a fast growth rate. Although the visible light transmittance
was high for a single VO2 layer, a higher Tlum for samples A–C is required to meet the standards
of window and glazing markets. It is important to note that commercial
windows are often sold with a visible light transmittance of 45–55%.
For instance, anti-reflection (AR) layers could be grown on the top
of VO2 thin films for improving Tlum. This could be the subject of a future study.

Conclusions
Single-layer VO2 thin films were synthesized by APCVD
using VCl4 and EtAc as vanadium and oxygen precursors,
respectively. It has been found that EtAc is a convenient oxygen source
to use in APCVD and can be used with VCl4 to synthesize
VO2 thin films. The use of EtAc allowed us to finely control
film morphology and thickness as a function of the molar flow rate
and deposition time. This study proposes the experimental conditions
to grow high-quality VO2 thin films with commercial precursors
and high growth rates, which is an advantage for large-scale processes.
The VO2 films showed excellent thermochromic properties
(ΔTsol = 7.8–12%) and were
highly reproducible. The visible light transmission of the VO2 thin films discussed in this work is among the highest for
thin films deposited by APCVD processes. However, these values could
be further improved upon addition of AR coatings and nanostructuring
of the films.

Experimental Section
All chemicals
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Vanadium(IV) chloride
(VCl4, 99%) and EtAc (C4H8O2, 99.8%) were used as the V and O sources, respectively. The substrate
was float glass (15 × 7 cm2; Pilkington, United Kingdom),
coated with a SiO2 barrier layer (50 nm). The deposition
occurred on the barrier coating, which was identified using a UVC
lamp (λ = 254 nm). Prior to deposition, substrates were cleaned
with soap, acetone, isopropan-2-ol, and deionized water and left to
air-dry.

APCVD
All of the experiments were performed on a custom-built
APCVD rig. The rig consisted of two bubblers, containing precursors,
which were linked to the reactor and the exhaust via heated stainless
steel pipes, as shown Figure 7. The reactor consisted of a quartz tube with a carbon block
with three inserted Whatman heater cartridges. All
heaters were controlled by Eurotherm controllers and RS type-k thermocouples.
The bubblers were heated so as to produce enough vapor pressure from
the precursors. The vaporized precursors were then carried to the
reaction chamber by a flow of oxygen-free N2 (BOC). The
mass flow of the precursors, VCl4 and EtAc, into the reactor
was calculated from the equation below  where a is the amount of
material introduced (in mol min–1), Vp is the vapor pressure of the material at the temperature
in the bubbler (mmHg), F is the flow rate of the
carrier gas (L min–1). Once the deposition was complete,
the substrate would be left to cool under a flow of N2 before
being removed once below 80 °C. All samples were handled and
stored in air.

Figure 7 APCVD rig scheme.

Film Analysis
The surface morphologies of the films
were determined by SEM using a JEOL JSM-6700 microscope (3 kV). The
roughness measurements were obtained using a Nanosurf easy scan AFM,
equipped with a 10 μm tip in noncontact mode with an oscillating
probe. The scan area was 5 μm × 5 μm with 20 nm scan
intervals. XRD was performed on a Bruker D8 Discover LynxEye diffractometer
using primary monochromated Cu Kα1 radiation (λ
= 1.5406 Å, 2θ = 5–66°, 0.05° per step).
XRD patterns were compared with Inorganic Crystal Structure Database
(ICSD) reference patterns for monoclinic VO2 (ICSD 34033).
Optical transmittances were monitored on a Perkin Elmer Lambda 950
UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer that was equipped with
a homemade heating unit. The thermochromic properties of the films
were measured by recording the transmittance spectra from 2500 to
250 nm as a function of temperature between 20 and 90 °C. The
Scotch tape test20 was used to determine
the adhesion of the films to the substrate. Thin films thicknesses
were determined by the φ SemiLab SE-2000 ellipsometer. XPS was
carried out on thin films using a Thermo Scientific K-α spectrometer
with monochromated Al Kα radiation, a dual beam charge compensation
system, and constant pass energy of 50 eV (spot size, 400 μm).
Spectra were recorded from 0 to1200 eV.
