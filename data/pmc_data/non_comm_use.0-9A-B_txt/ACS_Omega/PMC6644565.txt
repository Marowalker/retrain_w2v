Tall,
crystalline carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are desired to successfully
integrate them in various applications. As the crystallinity of CNTs
improves with increasing growth temperatures, higher growth temperatures
are required to obtain crystalline CNTs. However, in a typical chemical
vapor deposition (CVD) process, CNT growth rate reduces when the growth
temperature exceeds a specific level due to the degradation of the
catalyst particles. In this study, we have demonstrated the improved
catalytic activity of nickel/ferrocene-hybridized catalyst as compared
to sole ferrocene catalyst. To demonstrate this, CNTs are grown on
bare silicon (Si) as well as nickel (Ni) catalyst-deposited substrates
using volatile catalyst source (ferrocene/xylene) CVD at the growth
temperatures ranging from 790 to 880 °C. It was found that CNTs
grown on bare Si substrate experience a reduction in height at growth
temperature above 860 °C, whereas the CNTs grown on 10 nm Ni
catalyst-deposited substrates experience continuous increase in height
as the temperature increases from 790 to 880 °C. The enhancement
in the height of CNTs by the addition of Ni catalyst is also demonstrated
on 5, 20, and 30 nm Ni layers. The examination of CNTs using electron
microscopy and Raman spectra shows that the additional Ni catalyst
source improves the CNT growth rates and crystallinity, yielding taller
CNTs with a high degree of structural crystallinity.

Introduction
Since the discovery of carbon nanotubes
(CNTs) by Iijima,1 there has been an ongoing
interest in the properties
and the synthesis techniques for CNTs. Comprehensive understanding
of CNTs is required for their successful integration into the applications
that utilize their unique properties, including high mechanical strength,2 high aspect ratio,3 and outstanding electrical properties.4 These applications include field emission devices,5 separation science,6 miniaturized
interconnects and passives,7 energy storage,8 biomedical membrane,9 and so on, which have been proposed extensively in the past decade.
Among the reported potential applications, there has been increasing
interest in the application of CNTs in electronic interconnects due
to their outstanding electrical conductivity.10,11 At the same time, CNTs also show promise in field emission applications
due to their exceptionally high aspect ratio and unique electrical
properties.12 To integrate CNTs in these
applications, tall CNT pillars with specified degree of crystallinity
are needed.13,14 For instance, crystalline CNTs
with substantial height are needed for realizing an efficient bottom-up
filling of the via holes in miniatured interconnects;15 moreover, tall, high-aspect-ratio CNTs are required in
field emission applications to achieve high emission current density.16

In a typical chemical vapor deposition
(CVD) process for growing
CNTs, the widely accepted growth model assumes that the hydrocarbon
vapor is absorbed by the catalyst nanoparticles formed from thermal
annealing and catalytically decomposed carbon species are diffused
through the catalyst nanoparticles. Upon reaching supersaturation,
carbon structure will be precipitated out in the form of seamless
carbon cylinder.17 To achieve highly crystalline
CNTs, it has been reported that the growth temperature of CNTs plays
a significant role in their crystallinity.18,19 However, a common issue in obtaining tall, crystalline CNTs is the
reduction of CNT growth rate at high temperatures due to the reduction
in the catalytic activity.20,21 This reduction in the
CNT growth rate will lead to the formation of shorter CNTs, which
limits their performance in applications where tall, crystalline CNTs
are required.

It has been commonly reported that the reduction
of CNT growth
rate at high growth temperatures can be attributed to the catalyst-poisoning
phenomenon wherein catalyst particles are deactivated due to the encapsulation
of catalyst particles by amorphous carbon.21,22 This encapsulation will result in limiting the diffusion of hydrocarbon
source into the catalytic particles, hindering the nucleation of carbon
particles to form CNTs.23 However, it has
been reported by Xiang et al. that the decreasing growth of CNTs cannot
be solely attributed to the diffusion limit of hydrocarbon into the
catalyst nanoparticles, as suggested by the simulated and the experimental
outcomes.24 At the same time, Schünemann
et al. have suggested that the catalyst-poisoning phenomenon does
not give a comprehensive explanation of the reduction of CNT growth
rate at higher growth temperatures and needs to be re-examined. Nevertheless,
the reduction in the CNT growth rate can be attributed to various
factors such as the nucleation rate of catalytic particles, diffusion
of the hydrocarbon source during CVD growth, hydrogenation activity
on the precipitated carbon encapsulation, and so on.25

From the reported literatures, catalyst enhancement
in the CNT
growth can be carried out using two different approaches, reducing
the carbon encapsulation on the catalyst particles and enhancing the
CNT yield using mixed catalyst sources. To reduce carbon encapsulation,
introduction of etching agent (H2) has been reported to
prevent the encapsulation of catalyst particles by carbon precipitation.23,26 Besides using H2 etching agent, Patole et al. also reported
supergrowth of CNTs using water-assisted CVD. In the reported study,
water was used as a weak oxidizing agent to remove the amorphous carbon
coating around the catalyst particles, lengthening the lifetime of
the catalyst.27 Apart from etching and
oxidation to remove carbon encapsulation, Liu et al. have reported
the use of novel nanoarchitectured Co/Pt/Au catalyst. The use of nanostructured
Co/Pt/Au catalyst has been reported to reduce the formation of carbon
encapsulation around the catalytic particles.28

In the use of mixed catalyst sources, it has been reported
that
depositing nickel catalyst layer on the predeposited iron catalyst
layer promotes a higher CNT yield29 due
to a high hydrocarbon decomposition rate.30 Besides using bilayer nickel/iron catalyst, Atthipalli et al. have
reported use of hybridized catalyst combining the predeposited nickel
layer and continuously injecting volatile ferrocene catalyst sources
for dense, vertically aligned CNT growth.31,32 As ferrocene is an iron-containing organometallic compound, using
ferrocene/nickel-mixed catalyst source resembles the use of iron/nickel-mixed
catalyst, as discussed earlier. It can be predicted that the additional
catalytic activity of nickel to the ferrocene catalyst source contributes
significantly to the achievable CNT height and the crystallinity in
a CVD process. However, the comparative growth between the sole ferrocene
catalyst source and the nickel/ferrocene-hybridized catalyst source
is not addressed in the reported studies by Atthipalli et al. At the
same time, there still exist limited comparative studies between the
hybridized catalyst sources and other catalyst sources.

In this
study, the goal is to investigate the effect of adding
nickel catalyst to the volatile ferrocene catalyst source in the CNT
growth. We have performed a temperature-dependent comparative study
between use of the sole ferrocene catalyst source and the nickel/ferrocene-hybridized
catalyst sources in the CNT growth. We have demonstrated that CNTs
grown using sole ferrocene catalyst source experience reduction in
height above a specific growth temperature. On the other hand, the
CNTs grown using nickel/ferrocene-hybridized catalyst source experience
a continuous increase in height with increase in temperature. This
suggests that the additional nickel catalyst enhances the catalytic
activity of the ferrocene catalyst source. The use of nickel/ferrocene-hybridized
catalyst sources promotes tall, vertically aligned crystalline CNTs
that are desired for applications where these conditions are required.

Results
and Discussion
For all of the experiments, the chemical vapor
deposition (CVD)
growth temperature is varied between 790 and 880 °C on the nickel-deposited
(10 nm Ni) and bare silicon (Si) substrates, keeping all of the other
parameters constant. The CNTs show poor alignment for 800 °C
growth temperature on both 10 nm Ni and bare Si substrates, as shown
in Figure 1a,b. As
the growth temperature increases to 860 °C, the CNT alignment
improves, as shown in Figure 1c,d. As the growth temperature further increases to 880 °C,
homogeneous, vertically aligned CNT films are obtained on both 10
nm Ni and bare Si substrates, as seen in Figure 3e,f. Despite the appearance of detached CNTs,
it can be seen that tall (145 μm), vertically aligned CNTs are
grown on 10 nm Ni substrate at 880 °C growth temperature (Figure 1f). The CNT alignment
is highly dependent on the “crowding effect” between
CNTs, where the densely packed CNTs show a high degree of vertical
alignment due to the mechanical support between CNTs.33 At higher growth temperatures, the catalyst nanoparticles
size distribution is small and homogeneous;34 the small diameter, high-density CNTs grown from the small catalyst
nanoparticles are afflicted with high Van der Waals interactions,
which results in the vertical alignment of CNTs.35

at 800 °C, (c) bare Si and (d) 10 nm Ni substrates at 860 °C,
and (e) bare Si and (f) 10 nm Ni substrates at 880 °C.

The Raman characteristics of CNTs
grown at different temperatures
on 10 nm Ni and bare Si substrates are shown in Figure 2. The appearance of the D band (1339–1444
cm–1) and G band (1575–1577 cm–1) in the Raman spectrum for all of the investigated CNT samples indicate
the presence of a disorder in the graphitic structure and the in-plane
vibration of the C–C bond.36 Generally,
CNTs show an increasing degree of crystallinity (decreasing Id/Ig ratio) as the
growth temperature increases. This agrees well with Lee et al., who
showed that the degree of crystalline perfection in the CNTs increases
progressively as the growth temperature increases.19 Overall, the CNTs grown on 10 nm Ni substrate show a higher
degree of crystallinity (lower Id/Ig ratio) at higher growth temperatures. This
improvement in the degree of crystallinity can be attributed to the
catalytic effect by Ni, as suggested by Hoyos-Palacio et al.37

nm Ni substrates
at 790 and 880 °C; (b) Id/Ig ratio of CNTs grown on bare Si and 10 nm Ni
substrates at the growth temperatures between 790 and 880 °C.

To investigate the effect of growth
temperature on the CNT height,
we have compiled the CNT height–growth temperature profiles
for the CNT grown on 10 nm Ni and bare Si substrates, as shown in Figure 3. On the bare Si substrate, it is shown that the obtained
CNT height–growth temperature profiles possess a similar trend
as that reported by Bai et al., wherein the CNTs reach a maximum height
at a specific temperature and the height reduces as the growth temperature
increases further.21 As shown in Figure 3, the CNT height
increases from 1.45 to 31.32 μm on the bare Si substrate as
the growth temperature rises from 790 to 840 °C. This increment
of the CNT height can be attributed to the higher decomposition rate
of ferrocene at a higher temperature, which increases the catalytic
effect of ferrocene.16 The CNT height reaches
a saturation point of 34.28 μm at 860 °C. As the temperature
increases further to 880 °C, the CNT height reduces to 17.4 μm
due to the encapsulation of catalyst nanoparticles by hydrocarbon
precipitates,38 as predicted by Bai et
al.21 In contrast, the CNT height on 10
nm Ni substrate increases continuously with increase in the CVD growth
temperature from 790 to 880 °C. At 880 °C, much taller CNTs
are formed on 10 nm Ni substrate (145 μm) as compared with CNTs
formed on bare Si substrate (17.4 μm).

Figure 3 CNT heights on bare Si
and 10 nm Ni substrates at different growth
temperatures.

To further justify the
improvement in CNT heights by additional
Ni catalyst, we have repeated the CNT growth process on Ni catalyst
of different thickness, using the obtained optimal growth temperature
of 880 °C. Figure 4 presents the SEM images of the CNTs grown on 5, 20, and 30 nm Ni
catalyst and the variation of obtained CNT heights on different Ni
thicknesses. From the SEM images, it can be observed that the CNTs
grown on 5, 20, and 30 nm Ni catalyst show a vertical alignment, similar
to the CNTs obtained on the 10 nm Ni catalyst as exhibited in Figure 1. Among the investigated
Ni thickness, the tallest CNTs are grown from 5 nm Ni catalyst. As
the thickness of Ni catalyst increases, the shorter CNTs are obtained.
This obtained outcome is similar to several reported studies,39−41 wherein the CNT growth rate reduces with increase in the catalyst
thickness. To explain this outcome, Jang et al. suggested that variation
in the CNT heights with catalyst thickness can be attributed to the
carbon diffusion length in catalyst particles. For a thicker catalyst,
the diffusion length of carbon increases with decrease in the growth
rate, resulting in shorter CNTs.42 Nevertheless,
in this study, the CNTs grown from 5 to 30 nm Ni catalyst layer are
generally taller than the CNTs grown from pure ferrocene catalyst.
From the obtained CNT heights, it can be postulated that the formation
of taller CNTs on the Ni substrates is due to the additional assistance
of the Ni catalyst to the Fe catalyst from ferrocene.

using (a) 5 nm, (b) 20 nm, and (c) 30
nm thick Ni catalyst at 880 °C growth temperature. (d) Variation
in the CNT heights with Ni catalyst thickness.

For further verification of the above-mentioned postulation,
we
have performed the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) characterizations on the CNT samples grown
on bare Si and 10 nm Ni substrates. Multiple metal clusters are found
on the CNTs grown on both bare Si and 10 nm Ni substrates (Figure 5a,d). The tubular
and multiwalled structure of the CNTs on bare Si and 10 nm Ni substrates
can be seen in Figure 5b,e. The obtained structure of CNTs possesses similar morphological
properties as reported by Kar et al.43 CNTs
grown on 10 nm Ni substrate show a larger diameter (50.7 nm outer
diameter; 16.3 nm inner diameter) as compared to the CNTs grown on
bare Si substrate (20.8 nm outer diameter; 10.2 nm inner diameter).
As shown in Figure 5c,f, the metal clusters are found on the tips of CNTs on bare Si
and 10 nm Ni substrates. On both 10 nm Ni and bare Si substrates,
the metal clusters were wrapped by the multiwalled structure of CNTs,
which suggests the close-ended structure of the CNTs. Because ferrocene
is the sole catalyst source for CNTs grown on bare Si substrate, it
can be speculated that the metal clusters observed in Figure 5a,c are iron catalyst clusters.44 On the other hand, the metal clusters observed
in Figure 5b,f may
be comprised of both iron and nickel elements. This has been examined
further in the following.

Figure 5 TEM images of CNTs grown at 860 °C on (a–c)
bare Si
and (d–f) 10 nm Ni substrates under different magnifications.

To determine the elements present
in the metal clusters shown in Figure 5f, we performed EDS
characterization at multiple points located on the cluster. The EDS
characterization is carried out under scanning transmission electron
microscopy (STEM) view to accurately locate the metal clusters embedded
in the CNT body. As shown in Figure 6a, multiple metal clusters are found embedded in the
CNT body, with an exceptionally large metal cluster found on the tip
of the CNT. This embedded catalyst indicates a possible passivation
of the catalyst by the CNT walls or amorphous carbon precipitation.
EDS spectra are taken on four selected points of the CNT tip as shown
in Figure 6b. From Figure 6c–f, both
Fe and Ni elements are present from points 1–4. Exceptionally
high signal counts from Ni at points 2 and 3 suggests the tip-growth
mechanism of the CNTs from the Ni catalyst source, as agreed by Kim
et al.45 In summary, it is clear that both
Ni and Fe catalysts involve in the CNT growth on 10 nm Ni-deposited
substrates. From the EDS analysis shown in Figure 6, the nickel-rich metal cluster found on
the CNT tip suggested the tip-growth mechanism of the CNTs by nickel
catalyst. Besides, the larger diameter CNTs formed on 10 nm Ni substrate
as compared with those grown on bare Si substrate suggested the formation
of larger catalyst particles on 10 nm Ni substrate during the CNT
growth.46

10 nm Ni deposited substrate
at different magnifications; TEM–EDS spectra at (c) point 1,
(d) point 2, (e) point 3, and (f) point 4.

The achievement of taller CNT heights by additional Ni catalyst
can be attributed to the enhancement in the catalytic activity of
the CNT growth. It has been well-reported that water-assisted CVD
uses water molecules to oxidize the amorphous carbon formed on the
catalyst particles, resulting in a prolonged catalyst lifetime.27,47,48 On the other hand, Amama et al.
reported that water reduces the Ostwald ripening behavior among the
catalyst particles, enabling the formation of small, well-distributed
catalyst particles, which favors the growth of tall CNTs.49 In our current study, nickel/ferrocene-growth
CNTs show a larger diameter than the CNTs grown from the sole ferrocene
source. The formation of a larger CNT diameter indicates the formation
of larger catalyst particles by the nickel ferrocene source, attributed
to the additional nickel. Therefore, the anti-Ostwald ripening behavior
mechanism of the water-assisted CVD may not be the most suitable approach
in explaining the CNT growth enhancement in this study.

A possible
mechanism to explain the achievement of taller CNTs
by the additional Ni catalyst source is the increase in the CNT yield.
It has been reported that adding Ni to Fe catalyst source results
in a higher CNT yield.29,50 This can be attributed to the
increased rate of hydrocarbon decomposition by the additional Ni catalyst,
as reported by Qian et al.30 In our case,
it can be speculated that adding Ni into the ferrocene catalyst source
yields taller CNTs, possibly due to the improvement in the CNT yield
by accelerating the hydrocarbon decomposition rate. In conjunction
to the thicker CNTs formed by the additional Ni catalyst, it can be
postulated that the formation of thicker CNTs is attributed to the
formation of larger catalyst particles by Ni, whereas taller CNTs
are due to the additional catalytic activity upon the addition of
Ni catalyst. In summary, it has been demonstrated that adding nickel
to the ferrocene catalyst source yields taller CNTs, possibly attributed
to the higher hydrocarbon decomposition by the nickel/ferrocene catalyst
source.

Conclusions
Tall, crystalline CNTs are grown using
the nickel (Ni)/ferrocene-hybridized
catalyst source. The results obtained conclusively show that the additional
Ni catalyst source to ferrocene catalyst yields taller carbon nanotubes
(CNTs). To obtain these results, the CNTs are grown on the Ni-deposited
and bare Si substrates using a volatile catalyst (ferrocene/xylene)
source chemical vapor deposition (CVD) at the growth temperatures
ranging from 790 to 880 °C. It was found that the CNTs grown
on bare Si substrate experience a reduction in the height at growth
temperature above 860 °C. But the CNTs grown on 10 nm Ni substrates
experience a continuous increase in the height as the growth temperature
increases from 790 to 880 °C. The enhancement in the CNT heights
by the additional Ni catalyst is also demonstrated on 5, 20, and 30
nm Ni layers. At the same time, the CNTs grown on both 10 nm Ni and
bare Si substrates show a continuous improvement in the structural
crystallinity with the increasing growth temperature, as reflected
by the associated Id/Ig ratios obtained from the Raman spectrum of the CNTs.
These results together demonstrate the feasibility of a growing tall,
crystalline CNTs using the nickel/ferrocene-hybridized catalyst source,
which indicates a promising potential of this technique in the applications
where these conditions are needed.

Experimental Methods
N-doped silicon (Si) wafers are used as the substrates for all
of the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) growth studies in this work. As a comparative
study, the CNT growth is carried out on both 10 nm nickel (Ni) catalyst-deposited
and bare Si substrates. In the preparation of 10 nm Ni-deposited substrates,
30 nm titanium followed by 50 nm titanium nitrate are first sputtered
on the Si wafers as the barrier layer between the Ni catalyst and
Si substrate. After that, 10 nm Ni catalyst is deposited on the titanium
nitrate layer using the electron beam evaporation technique. The CNT
growth processes are carried out on 10 nm Ni and bare Si substrates
using an established volatile catalyst source (ferrocene/xylene) chemical
vapor deposition (CVD) technique, described in the previous studies
reported by our research group.51−53 A typical CVD process is carried
out in a 1/2 inch diameter quartz tube reactor in a continuous argon
gas flow at temperatures of 790, 800, 820, 840, 860, and 880 °C
under continuous injection of ferrocene/xylene solution. The ferrocene
concentration in xylene solvent is fixed to be 1 wt %, the argon gas
flow is fixed to be 100 sccm, and the growth duration is fixed at
60 s. At 880 °C growth temperature, it is found that the CNTs
grown on 10 nm Ni substrate are significantly taller than those grown
on bare Si substrate. After that, the CVD process using 880 °C
growth temperature is then repeated on 5, 20, and 30 nm Ni-deposited
substrates. The morphologies of the CNTs are characterized by field
emission scanning electron microscopy (LEO 1550 Gemini SEM) and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM, Philips Tecnai 20). The Raman spectra are
measured using a single monochromator with a microscope micro-Raman
spectroscopy system (WITec) with 532 nm laser wavelength.
