A novel nitrile-/cyano-free ionic
liquid was synthesized and carbonized
under two different carbonization methods in the presence of ZnCl2 as a catalyst to afford N-doped carbon materials. It was
found that the carbonization condition could affect the nature and
textural properties of the resulting carbon. In the following, ionic
liquid-derived carbon was hybridized with naturally occurring halloysite
nanotubes via two procedures, that is, hydrothermal treatment of halloysite
and as-prepared carbon and carbonization of ionic liquid in the presence
of halloysite. The two novel nanocomposites were then used for stabilizing
Pd nanoparticles. Examining the structures and catalytic activities
of the resulting catalysts for the hydrogenation of nitroarenes in
aqueous media showed that the carbonization procedure and hybridization
method could affect the structure and the catalytic activity of the
catalysts and hydrothermal approach, in which the structure of halloysite
is preserved, leading to the catalyst with superior catalytic activity.

Introduction
Considering the wide
range of applications of heteroatom-doped
carbon materials,1−5 many attempts have been made to develop efficient methods for their
preparation.6,7 In this context, two main methodologies,
that is, posttreatment of carbon materials with suitable gases and
carbonization of heteroatom-containing precursors, have been developed.8 In contrast, homogeneous incorporation of nitrogen
with a controlled chemistry is achieved by the latter approach, and
as a part of these methodologies, a wide range of precursors such
as pyridine,9 acetonitrile,10 polyacrylonitrile,11 or others12 have been used. However,
carbonization of most of organic compounds generates completely gaseous
products under the high-temperature procedure, so currently available
precursors are rather limited. Polymer-related procedures, on the
other hand, are multistep and time-consuming. These deficiencies have
led scientists to focus on a new category of compounds such as carbon
precursors.

Ionic liquids, ILs, are organic salts composed of
heteroatom-containing
cations as well as anions.13 Conventional
ILs have low vapor pressure and are not proper for carbonization,
while nitrile-/cyano-containing ILs can tolerate harsh condition of
carbonization to furnish heteroatom-doped carbon materials.14−16 However, the synthesis of these compounds is time-consuming and
costly. Moreover, the textural properties of the final carbon are
not mostly satisfying and need some modification. Hence, other methodologies
such as carbonization of confined conventional ILs and use of template
and structural guides17,18 have been developed.15,16 However, each approach has its own drawbacks.

The biocompatible
and nontoxic nature of naturally occurring halloysite
nanoclay, Hal, as well as its availability expanded its applications
in many scientific and industrial uses such as composite and material
science, catalysis, cleaning, separation, smart delivery systems,
and so forth.18−31 Considering the increasing use of Hal, it can be concluded that
this natural clay is focused remarkably and can be considered as a
potential alternative for many synthetic inorganic compounds such
as mesoporous silica or conventional minerals. As Hal possesses a
tubular morphology with tunable surface area and attractive textural
and mechanical properties,18,21,22,32,33 its utility as a catalyst support has received much attention. Hal
in its individual or functionalized form or in combination with other
compounds can be used for the catalytic purposes.20,34,35

Using hydrogen gas as a reducing agent
for transforming unsaturated
chemicals to the saturated counterparts is economically and environmentally
interesting process. To promote hydrogenation reactions such as converting
nitro group to amine functionality, use of the catalyst is imperative.
In this context, mostly, precious metals are used, which make the
process costly. To circumvent this limitation, supporting catalysts
on efficient supports that do not deactivate the catalytic sites and
result in heterogeneous and recyclable catalysts are proposed.36−40

In continuation of our study on the catalytic composites,41 recently, we disclosed the outstanding performance
of Hal–carbon composites as catalyst supports.42,43 Our results confirmed the synergism between Hal and carbon that
resulted in the catalysts with superior catalytic performances compared
to the individual components. Considering these promising results
and in the search for novel Hal–C composite systems, herein
we present a novel catalyst that was obtained through immobilization
of Pd nanoparticles on a composite prepared from the hydrothermal
treatment of Hal with a novel IL-derived N-doped porous carbon. Notably,
to synthesize the N-doped carbon material, a new cyano-/nitrile-free
IL (TCT-IMI) was designed and synthesized from the reaction of cyanuric
chloride and 1-methyl imidazole through a simple protocol (Figure 1). In this study,
use of ZnCl2 as a catalyst was presented for efficient
carbonization of IL in the absence of any structural guide. This approach
not only obviates the need for confinement of ILs or using costly
nitrile-containing ILs but also presents a cost-effective and simple
method for preparing N-doped porous carbons. To study the effect of
carbonization temperature on the nature of the resulting carbon materials,
two samples carbonized under two different carbonization methods were
prepared, and their structural features were compared. Moreover, to
study the effect of method of hybridization of Hal and IL-derived
carbon on the catalytic activity of the final catalyst, two protocols,
carbonization of IL in the presence of Hal and hydrothermal treatment
of Hal in the presence of IL-derived carbon, were examined, and the
structures of two composites as well as their catalytic performances
were compared for the hydrogenation of nitroarenes.

the synthesis of CIL-1, CIL-2, Pd@Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-C,
and Pd@Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-HT.

Results
and Discussion
To prepare the hybrid of Hal and IL-derived
carbon, a novel task-specific
cyano-/nitrile-free IL was first synthesized (see the Experimental Section). The formation of TCT-IMI was confirmed
by recording its 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra
as well as thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The TGA of the IL showed
a weight loss below 150 °C that is due to the loss of water and
a weight loss at about 250 °C that can be assigned to the degradation
of IL (Figure S1).

The NMR spectroscopy
has provided sufficient information on the
structure of TCT-IMI and confirmed the accuracy of the structure. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopies (Figure S2) revealed the characteristic signals of four hydrogen
types and five carbon types in the synthesized IL structure, respectively.
The symmetry in the TCT-IMI structure has led to the adaptation of
the hydrogen signals in the imidazolium rings. The detailed NMR data
are as follows:

1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO): δ 2.5
(s, 3H, −CH3), 7.64 (s, 3H, −CH−),
7.69 (s, 3H, −CH−),
9.18 (s, 3H, −CH−); 13C NMR (100 MHz, DMSO):
δ 35.8, 120.1, 123.5, 135.9, 150.3.

In the following,
TCT-IMI was used as a carbon precursor to prepare
a carbon material, CIL. To study the effect of carbonization condition
on the nature of the resulting carbon material, two different thermal
processes were used for the carbonization (see the Experimental Section for the preparation of CIL-1 and CIL-2).
The characterizations of the resulting carbons, CIL-1 and CIL-2, are
as follows:

CIL-1 was characterized by applying Raman, Fourier
transform infrared
(FTIR), CHN, TGA, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) techniques (Figure 2). As depicted in Figure 2A, the FTIR spectrum of CIL-1 confirmed that the formed
carbon material possessed some functional groups. In detail, the characteristic
bands at 1546 and 1627 cm–1 can be assigned to the
−C=C and −C=N functionalities, respectively,
the band at 3423 cm–1 can be indicative of −OH
groups, and the observed band at 2850 cm–1 can be
representative of the −CH2 functionality. The thermogram
of CIL-1 (Figure 2B)
indicated the high thermal stability of this sample, confirming the
successful carbonization. The XRD pattern of CIL-1 (Figure 2C) exhibited a broad band at
2θ = 15–23° as well as two sharp bands at 2θ
= 26° that can indicate the diamond–lonsdaleite system.44 The Raman spectrum of CIL-1 (Figure 2D) indicated
that the nature of the formed carbon is diamond-like amorphous carbon.45,46 According to the literature,47,48 the amorphous nature
of CIL-1 can be attributed to the high content of nitrogen atoms in
the carbon lattice that led to the amorphization of the graphitic
network. To confirm this issue, the CHN analysis was performed. According
to the CHN analysis, the percentages of H, C, and N in CIL-1 were
calculated to be 1.61, 62.21, and 10.96%, respectively. Finally, the
N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm of CIL-1 showed
type II isotherm with a specific surface area of 41 m2 g–1.

spectrum
(D) of CIL-1.

Figure 3 FTIR spectrum (A), XRD pattern (B), Raman spectrum
(C), and TGA
(D) of CIL-2.

Similar to CIL-1, the formation
of CIL-2 was verified by using
FTIR, CHN, BET, Raman, TGA, and XRD (Figure 3). As depicted in Figure 3A, CIL-2 exhibited the characteristic bands
at 3451, 2952, 1729, and 1658 cm–1 that can be attributed
to the −OH, −CH2, −C=N, and
−C=C functionalities, respectively. Similar to CIL-1,
the thermogram of CIL-2 (Figure 3D) confirmed the successful carbonization and high
thermal stability of this sample. The XRD pattern as well as the Raman
spectrum of CIL-2 (Figure 3B,C) was distinguished
from those of CIL-1. As shown, the Raman spectrum of CIL-2 exhibited
two bands at 1343 and 1584 cm–1 that are indicative
of the graphitic nature of CIL-2. The XRD pattern of CIL-2 (Figure 4C) showed a band at 2θ = 25° that confirms the
graphitic nature of CIL-2. Considering the previous reports,49 it can be assumed that the formation of a graphitic
carbon initiated at an early step of carbonization and the low-temperature
thermal decomposition of the IL controls whether or not the final
carbon generated at the elevated temperature will be graphitic. Consequently,
CIL-2 with a longer carbonization process at a lower temperature has
a more graphitic structure.

Notably, the specific surface area
of CIL-2 was estimated to be
568 m2 g–1 that is far higher than that
of CIL-1. According to the CHN analysis, the percentages of H, C,
and N in CIL-2 were calculated to be 1.32, 68.41, and 7.87%, respectively.
Comparing the CHN results of CIL-1 and CIL-2, it can be concluded
that using a longer and harsher carbonization protocol led to the
decrease of the N content. This observation is in good agreement with
the previous reports.50

The characterization
of two carbon materials, CIL-1 and CIL-2,
indicated that the carbonization condition affects the properties
(specific surface area, nitrogen content, etc.) of the resulting carbon.
Interestingly, the catalytic activity of the catalysts prepared via
Pd immobilization of these two carbon materials also showed different
catalytic activities, and Pd@CIL-2 was more effective than Pd@CIL-1
(vide infra). Considering the superior performance of CIL-2 for the
catalytic purpose and in an attempt to improve its activity, CIL-2
was hybridized with Hal. For this purpose, two different hybridization
processes were examined. First, TCT-IMI was carbonized in the presence
of Hal to generate Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-C. The second procedure was
the hydrothermal treatment of Hal with CIL-2 to afford Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-HT.
The two hybrid systems were then used as Pd supports. The resulting
catalysts, Pd@Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-HT and Pd@Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-C,
were then characterized.

The structure of Pd@Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-C
was verified by FTIR,
XRD, TGA, and BET. Moreover, to study the effect of the incorporation
of CIL-2 on the structure of Hal, all the above-mentioned analyses
were compared with those of pristine Hal (Figure 4). As depicted in Figure 4A, the FTIR spectra of Pd@Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-C
and Hal are distinguishable. More precisely, in the FTIR spectrum
of Hal, the characteristic bands at 1107 cm–1 that
is indicative of Si–O stretching, 3696 and 3624 cm–1 that are due to the internal hydroxyl functionality of Hal, and
580 cm–1 that represents Al–O–Si vibration
can be observed, while in the FTIR spectrum of Pd@Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-C,
some Hal characteristic bands disappeared and the characteristic bands
of CIL-2 can be detected. In more details, a short characteristic
band at 1107 cm–1 (Si–O stretching) can be
observed in the FTIR spectrum of Pd@Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-C. According
to the literature, thermal treatment of Hal that can affect the structure
of Hal can justify this observation.51 The
Hal thermogram (Figure 5B) showed two weight losses at ∼120 and 540 °C that are
due to the loss of water in the Hal framework and dehydroxylation
of the Hal matrix, respectively.52,53 Pd@Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-C
that contained CIL-2 with high thermal stability however showed higher
thermal stability compared to the pristine Hal. In Figure 4C, comparison of the XRD pattern
of Hal and Pd@Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-C showed that the two samples
exhibited different XRD patterns. More precisely, the XRD pattern
of Pd@Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-C does not contain the characteristic
bands of Hal (2θ = 12.4, 18.8, 20.5, 25.2, 36.7, 39.0, 56.3,
and 62.5°) (JCPDS no. 29-1487, labeled as *)54,55 but shows a broad 2θ = 20–30° that is representative
of amorphous silica. This observation indicates that thermal treatment
led to the destruction of the Hal structure. This observation is in
good agreement with the literature,51,56 which indicated
that under carbonization condition Hal tubes can be transferred to
silica nanoparticles. In the XRD pattern of Pd@Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-C,
the characteristic bands of CIL-2 and Pd nanoparticles (at 2θ
= 40, 46.6, 68.4, 82.4, and 87°, JCPDS, card no. 46-1043, labeled
as “o”) can also be observed. The BET analysis of Pd@Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-C
showed that the specific surface area of this sample was 436 m2 g–1. This value is higher than that of
Hal (51 m2 g–1) and lower than that of
CIL-2 (568 m2 g–1). It is believed that
transformation of Hal nanotubes to amorphous silica upon harsh carbonization
condition can block some of the pores of CIL-2 and resulted in lower
specific surface area compared to that of CIL-2.

(B), and XRD patterns (C) of Pd@Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-C
and pristine Hal.

and pristine Hal.

The next sample characterized
was Pd@Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-HT that
was prepared under hydrothermal condition. First, the FTIR spectrum
of this sample was recorded (Figure 5). Similar to Pd@Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-C, the FTIR
spectrum of Pd@Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-HT was compared with that of
Hal. As depicted, the FTIR spectrum of Pd@Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-HT
exhibited the characteristic bands of CIL-2. Similar to the previous
sample, the Hal characteristic bands are less pronounced in Pd@Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-HT.

In Figure 6, the
XRD pattern of Pd@Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-HT is compared with that of
pristine Hal. In the Pd@Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-C sample, the Hal structure
collapsed under harsh carbonization condition and no Hal bands were
observed, whereas in the Pd@Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-HT XRD pattern,
the Hal characteristic bands can be detected. This observation confirmed
that hydrothermal treatment did not destruct the Hal structure. Apart
from Hal bands, the characteristic bands of CIL-2 and Pd nanoparticles
are also observable.

Hal.

In Figure 7, the
TGA thermograms of pristine Hal as well as Pd@Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-HT
are depicted. Comparing the two thermograms, it can be concluded that
the latter exhibited higher thermal stability that can be attributed
to the incorporation of CIL-2 with high thermal stability.

Figure 7 TGAs of pristine
Hal and Pd@Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-HT.

Pd@Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-HT was further characterized via BET and
ICP. The ICP analysis of Pd@Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-HT revealed that
the loading of Pd was low (0.01 mmol g–1). The BET
analysis of Pd@Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-HT showed that the specific surface
area of this sample was 740 m2 g–1 that
was higher than that of CIL-2. It is postulated that incorporation
of hollow tubes of Hal in combination with CIL-2 can justify this
observation.

Finally, to investigate the morphology of Pd@Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-HT,
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the catalyst were
recorded. In Figure 8, one of the TEM images of the catalyst is depicted. As shown, Hal
nanotubes are observable, confirming that incorporation of IL-derived
carbon did not result in the collapse of the Hal structure (this was
also confirmed via XRD analysis). However, in some parts, thickening
of the tubes and their coverage by fine IL-derived carbon can be seen.
On the other hand, fine Pd nanoparticles (small black spots) with
an average diameter of 3 ± 1.0 nm and homogeneous dispersion
on the support can be detected, indicating that Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-HT
could effectively prevent the aggregation of Pd nanoparticles.

Pd@Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-HT.

To investigate the catalytic activity of the palladated Hal–carbon
composite and to study the effect of preparation condition on the
catalytic activity of the resulting catalytic composite, hydrogenation
of nitroarenes was selected as a model catalytic reaction. To start
the catalytic experiments, hydrogenation of nitrobenzene was performed
in the absence of any catalyst to confirm the necessity of a catalyst
for this reaction (Table 1, entry 1). As shown, no aniline was collected without the
use of the catalyst. Next, the catalytic activity of Pd@Hal was investigated
for this model reaction (Table 1, entry 2) under optimum reaction condition (use of water
as the solvent and catalyst 1 wt %). As tabulated, the efficiency
of Pd@Hal was low, and only 30% aniline was achieved after 1 h. This
result indicated that Hal in its individual form is not an efficient
support. According to the literature, this can be attributed to the
weak interaction of Hal and Pd.57 In the
following, the catalytic activity of Pd@CIL was investigated. As shown,
two carbons, CIL-1 and CIL-2, prepared via two different carbonization
protocols and possessed different natures, showed different catalytic
activities (Table 1, entries 3 and 4), and Pd@CIL-2 resulted in superior catalytic activity.
This result can be attributed to the higher specific surface area
of CIL-2 (see the BET results) that led to uniform distribution of
Pd nanoparticles.58,59 Moreover, the measurement of
the Pd loading of two catalysts, that is, Pd@CIL-1 and Pd@CIL-2, showed
that the Pd loading of the latter (0.41 mmol g–1) was almost 2 times the former.

Having the best
CIL in hand, the composite of Hal with CIL-2 was
prepared, and its catalytic activity was investigated. In this line,
the effects of two factors, that is, the ratio of Hal/CIL-2 and the
method of preparation of the nanocomposite on the catalytic activity
of the final catalyst, were examined. The effect of the ratio of Hal/CIL-2
was investigated via comparison of the catalytic activities of three
control catalysts with different Hal/CIL-2 ratios (Table 1, entries 5–7). As depicted,
the 1:2 ratio of Hal/CIL-2 led to the best catalytic activity. To
shed more light on this observation, the TGAs of all three samples
were carried out, and the content of CIL was calculated in all samples.
The results confirmed that in Pd@Hal–CIL-2(1:2), the content
of C was higher than that of other two samples, indicating that CIL
can contribute to the catalysis. This effect can be justified by the
capability of N-doped carbon for the anchoring of Pd nanoparticles.
In other words, it can be observed that in Pd@Hal–CIL-2(1:2)
with more CIL-2, the nitrogen functionalities in the structure of
CIL-2 can more effectively interact with Pd nanoparticles through
electrostatic interactions. This result was further confirmed by the
ICP analysis that indicated higher Pd loading of Pd@Hal–CIL-2(1:2)
compared to that of the other two samples.

To elucidate the
effect of the preparation method on the catalytic
activity, two samples, Pd@Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-HT that was prepared
through the hydrothermal treatment of Hal and CIL-2 and Pd@Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-C
that was synthesized by the carbonization of IL in the presence of
Hal, were compared in the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene (Table 1, entries 7 and 8).
As demonstrated, the sample prepared via hydrothermal treatment of
as-prepared CIL-2 with Hal showed a higher catalytic activity. The
lower catalytic activity of Pd@Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-C can be attributed
to the destruction of Hal in the course of preparation. According
to the literature,21 Hal can not only play
the role of the catalyst support but also exert the catalytic activity.
Moreover, its presence in the nanocomposite mostly resulted in the
synergism that favored the catalytic activity.42 Hence, destruction of Hal may decrease the catalytic activity.
On the other hand, the lower specific surface area of Pd@Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-C
compared to that of Pd@Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-HT can account for the
lower catalytic activity of the former.

In the following, two
other substrates, that is, 4-nitroacetophenone
and 1-nitronaphthalene as representatives of the substrates with competing
functionality and steric hindrance, were hydrogenated under Pd@Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-HT
catalysis (Table 2).
As tabulated, both substrates could tolerate the hydrogenation reaction
to furnish the corresponding products in high yields. The interesting
point was that in the case of 4-nitroacetophenone, hydrogenation of
keto functionality was not observed, and the selectivity toward the
nitro group was 100%.

Notably, nitroarenes
with different electron densities could also
tolerate the hydrogenation reaction to afford the corresponding products
in high yields.

To elucidate whether Pd@Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-HT
catalysis is real
heterogeneous and the hydrogenation reaction does not proceed by leached
Pd nanoparticles in the reaction mixture, hot filtration test was
performed. As expected, by removing Pd@Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-HT from
the reaction mixture after short reaction time, no reaction progress
was observed, indicating that in the course of the reaction, leaching
of Pd nanoparticles from Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-HT and their redeposition
did not occur and the catalyst was heterogeneous.

The final
feature of Pd@Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-HT that was investigated
in this research was its recyclability. To find out whether Pd@Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-HT
can be recycled, it was recovered and reused for the hydrogenation
of nitrobenzene (more details are provided in the Experimental Section). The measurement of the yields of aniline
after each reaction cycle (Figure 9) confirmed that Pd@Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-HT could
be successfully reused with no loss of its catalytic activity for
the second run of the reaction. Recycling for the third reaction run
showed slight loss of the catalytic activity (3%). The loss of the
catalytic activity for the fourth and fifth reaction run was more
pronounced (about 8 and 14% compared to the fresh catalyst, respectively).
Recycling for the sixth reaction run led to a significant decrease
of the aniline yield.

in the
hydrogenation of nitrobenzene.

In the following, the recycled Pd@Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-HT was
structurally investigated by FTIR spectroscopy (Figure 10). As illustrated, although
in the FTIR spectrum of the recycled catalyst some broadening of the
bands can be observed compared to the fresh Pd@Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-HT,
the characteristic bands are still maintained, indicating the stability
of Pd@Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-HT under recycling. The ICP analysis of
the recycled catalysts confirmed no leaching of Pd nanoparticles after
the first reaction run. Further recycling, however, led to slight
Pd leaching, and upon the sixth run, Pd leaching reached its highest
value (0.85 wt % initial loading).

Finally, to investigate whether recycling of Pd@Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-HT
could cause any aggregation of Pd nanoparticles, TEM images of recycled
Pd@Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-HT were obtained (Figure 11). As illustrated, similar to fresh Pd@Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-HT,
in the recycled catalyst Pd nanoparticles are distributed on the surface
of the support homogeneously without aggregation.

Pd@Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-HT.

Conclusions
Pd@Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-HT was prepared through a three-step procedure,
in which CIL-2 was first prepared via carbonization of a novel IL
synthesized from the reaction of TCT and 1-methyl imidazole, followed
by hybridization with Hal under hydrothermal condition and Pd immobilization.
The nanocomposite was then used as an efficient and heterogeneous
catalyst for the hydrogenation of nitroarenes. It was revealed that
the carbonization temperature can significantly affect the features
of the resulting CIL. Moreover, the hybridization procedure could
influence the catalytic activity of the resulting nanocomposite. In
the sample prepared via carbonization of IL in the presence of Hal,
the structure of Hal was destructed and the resulting nanocomposite
showed inferior catalytic activity. The study of the ratio of Hal/CIL
also disclosed that the optimum ratio was 1:2 and the lower content
of CIL resulted in a less efficient catalyst. This was attributed
to the role of CIL in more effective anchoring of Pd nanoparticles.
Notably, the catalyst, Pd@Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-HT, was highly selective
toward the nitro group and showed good recyclability.

Materials and Instruments
All chemicals and solvents
including 1-methyl imidazole, cyanuric chloride (TCT), zinc chloride,
Hal, NaBH4, Pd(OAc)2, DMSO, MeOH, Et2O, deionized water, toluene, ethyl acetate, and n-hexane were received from Sigma-Aldrich. The hydrogenation reaction
was performed by using nitroarenes as the substrate. All the chemicals
were of analytical grade and used without further purification. The
progress of the reactions was monitored by thin-layer chromatography
(TLC) on commercial aluminum-backed plates of silica gel 60 F254,
which was visualized using ultraviolet light. Notably, all the organic
products were known, and their identification was performed by comparing
their melting points for solid products in open capillaries using
an Electrothermal 9100 and FTIR spectra with those of authentic samples.

The Philips CM30300Kv field emission transmission electron microscope
was used for studying the morphology of the nanocomposite. Powder
XRD patterns were recorded by using Siemens. TGAs were accomplished
by using a METTLER TOLEDO instrument. To carry out the analysis, the
samples were heated under inert atmosphere with a heating rate of
10 °C min–1 over the range of 40–800
°C. FTIR spectra of all carbons and nanocomposites were recorded
by the PerkinElmer-Spectrum 65 instrument using KBr pellets. The nitrogen
adsorption and desorption isotherms were obtained using a BELSORP
Mini II. For this analysis, all the samples were preheated at 200
°C for 3 h. The Raman spectra of the prepared carbon materials
were recorded by using the TEKSAN-N1-541 spectrum at k = 532 nm instrument. The 1H NMR and 13C NMR
spectra were recorded by a Bruker DRX-500 spectrometer. The ultrasonic
apparatus employed for the synthesis of nanocomposites was Bandelin
HD 3200 that was equipped with tip TT13 with the output power between
100 and 200 W. Metal loading and leaching on the catalyst were measured
by using the ICP analyzer (Varian, Vista-pro).

Catalyst Preparation
Synthesis
of TCT-IMI Ionic Liquid
To synthesize TCT-IMI,
cyanuric chloride (50 mmol) was dissolved in 50 mL of toluene, and
the solution was heated up to 110 °C under reflux condition.
Subsequently, a solution of 1-methyl imidazole (160 mmol) in 60 mL
of toluene was added to the aforementioned solution in a stepwise
manner. More precisely, a solution of 1-methyl imidazole (50 mmol
in 20 mL of toluene) was first added, and the mixture was stirred
for 24 h. Second, the second portion of 1-methyl imidazole (50 mmol
in 20 mL of toluene) was introduced, and the resulting solution was
mixed for 24 h. Finally, the third portion of 1-methyl imidazole (60
mmol in 20 mL of toluene) was added, and stirring was continued for
48 h under Ar atmosphere. Upon completion of the reaction, the mixture
was cooled to room temperature, and the yellowish product was filtered
over a Buchner funnel. To purify the product, the obtained material
was successively washed with excess Et2O and toluene and
dried in an oven at 100 °C for 12 h to furnish pure TCT-IMI.

Synthesis of CIL-1
To synthesize CIL 1, TCT-IMI (3
g) and ZnCl2 (12 g) were mixed and ground thoroughly. Then,
the obtained paste was transferred into a quartz tube (10 × 50
cm) and heated under programmed temperature (heating at 300 °C
for 0.5 h, followed by heating at 700 °C for 5 and 1 h at 900
°C) in a tubular furnace under N2 atmosphere. After
cooling to room temperature, the obtained black powder was ground.
To remove the catalyst, the resulting carbon was stirred in HCl (3
M, 250 mL) for 24 h. Finally, the resulting black powder was filtered
off, washed successively with water and EtOH, and dried in an oven
at 100 °C for 24 h.

Synthesis of CIL-2
CIL-2 was prepared
using the similar
procedure that was applied for CIL-1, except the heating program was
different. The used heating program was initially heated at 400 °C
for 4 h, followed by heating at 900 °C for 1 h.

Synthesis
of Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-HT
Hal–CIL-2-HT
was prepared by using the hydrothermal method. Initially, CIL-2 (2
g) and Hal (1 g) were mixed in deionized water (100 mL) and homogenized
under ultrasonic irradiation of power 150 W for 0.5 h. Subsequently,
the resulting suspension was transferred into an autoclave and heated
at 220 °C for 48 h. At the end of the reaction, the reactor was
cooled to room temperature, and the obtained black powder was filtered
over a Buchner funnel, washed thoroughly with water, and then dried
in an oven at 100 °C for 24 h. Notably, apart from the main sample,
Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-HT, other samples, Hal–CIL-2(1:1)-HT
and Hal–CIL-2(2:1)-HT with different ratios of Hal/CIL, were
synthesized under the same condition used for the synthesis of Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-HT.

Synthesis of Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-C
TCT-IMI IL (3
g), ZnCl2 (12 g), and Hal (1 g) were mixed and ground to
soft dough. Subsequently, the obtained yellowish dough was transferred
into a quartz tube (10 × 50 cm) and carbonized under N2 atmosphere. The heating program was as follows: heating at 400 °C
in a tubular furnace, followed by further treatment at 900 °C
for 1 h. Upon completion of the carbonization, the reactor was cooled
to room temperature, and the resulting black solid was suspended in
HCl (3 M, 250 mL) and stirred for 24 h to remove ZnCl2.
The product was further purified by washing with water and EtOH. Finally,
the resulting solid (Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-C) was dried in an oven
at 100 °C for 24 h.

Incorporation of Pd into Different Supports,
That Is, Hal, CIL-1,
CIL-2, Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-HT, and Hal–CIL-2(1:2)-C
Immobilization of Pd nanoparticles on the support was achieved through
the wet-impregnation procedure. Briefly, 1.2 g of the support was
added to 30 mL of toluene and sonicated for 0.5 h to furnish a well-dispersed
suspension. Then, a solution of 0.1 mmol of Pd(OAc)2 in
20 mL of toluene was added to the above-mentioned suspension in a
dropwise manner. After stirring at room temperature for 2 h, a solution
of reducing agent, that is, NaBH4 in H2O (10
mL, 0.2 N), was introduced to furnish Pd(0) nanoparticles. Finally,
the precipitate was filtered, washed three times with MeOH, and dried
in an oven at 100 °C for 12 h. The general synthetic procedure
of the catalyst is shown in Figure 1.

Catalyst Application: General Procedure for
the Hydrogenation
Reaction of Nitroarene
In a typical process for nitroarene
hydrogenation, an appropriate amount of solid catalyst (1 wt %) was
added into a mixture of nitroarene (1 mmol) in 3 mL of deionized water
in a three-necked flask at room temperature. After purging with hydrogen
three times, the final pressure was adjusted to 1 bar, and the glass
reactor was stirred vigorously. The progress of the reaction was traced
by TLC (ratio of n-hexane/ethyl acetate solvent,
10:1). After the end of the reaction, the solid catalyst was separated
by centrifuging at 5000 rpm and washed several times with deionized
water and absolute ethanol. The separated catalyst was dried in an
oven and reused for the next reaction run. The hydrogenized product
was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 10 mL) and dried over anhydrous
Na2SO4 and evaporated under vacuum to obtain
the product.
