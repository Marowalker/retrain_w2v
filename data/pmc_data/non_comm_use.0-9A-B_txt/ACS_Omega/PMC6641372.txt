Environmentally friendly multifunctional
rubber composites are
reported. Graphitic nanocarbon (NC) deriving from cracking of biogas
(methane/carbon dioxide) and natural rubber extracted directly from
the Hevea brasiliensis tree are the
two components of these composites produced via latex technology.
While maintaining and enhancing the intrinsic thermal and mechanical
characteristics of rubber, the presence of NC shows a significant
improvement on the electrical response. For a 10 wt % NC content,
a 1010-fold increase in conductivity has been achieved
with a conductivity value of 7.5 S·m–1, placing
these composites among the best obtained using other carbon fillers.
In addition, the piezoresistive behavior has also been verified. These
promising green composites have a potential use in a variety of applications
such as sealing of electronic devices and sensors.

Introduction
Natural rubber (NR)
is a biopolymer composed mainly of poly(cis-1,4-isoprene).
Elastomers, such as NR, are harnessed
in high-volume products such as tires, pipes, and belting.1 It is a strategic material that cannot be replaced
by synthetic rubbers for a variety of applications because of its
unique characteristics such as outstanding elasticity, flexibility
at low temperatures, and resistance to abrasion.2 It has been used in several fields, from medicine and personal
protective equipment to asphalt paving roads.3−5 The ultimate
properties of NR composites depend not just on the polymers, but also
on the fillers, such as nanocarbon, silica, and others.1 Carbon black (CB) is one of the materials principally
utilized to reinforce polymer properties.6−8 A lot of research
work has been performed to replace total or partial CB. There are
several academic studies that substitute CB by harnessing allotropes
from the carbon family such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene oxide,
reduced graphene oxide (RGO), and carbon nanoplatelets.7−17 However, to reinforce the properties of synthetic rubber and NR,
the rubber industry still widely utilizes CB.1 Its cost-effectiveness combined with its intrinsic properties makes
CB the principle candidate to address rubber limitations. However,
rather high loads of CB are necessary to reach optimal performances
with the associated problems of color (black), cost, and eventual
diminution of the matrix properties/behavior. Therefore, a replacement
candidate should be both economical and effective. Graphitic fillers
have long been tested as additives for rubber.18 The graphitic nanocarbons under the study have two important
peculiarities: (i) it originates from methane, that is, potentially
from food waste and thus would contribute to more sustainable materials
and (ii) it has a narrow size distribution around 50 nm lateral size
and 5 nm thickness. Food waste can be transformed into high-value
graphitic nanocarbon (NC) and renewable hydrogen.19 Methane/carbon dioxide mix, originating from anaerobic
digestion of food waste, is split into NC and hydrogen via a microwave
plasma process. The resulting graphitic NC needs to be assessed as
a valid candidate to substitute the petroleum-based carbon additives
(CB) in polymer composites.19 In this work,
homogeneous multifunctional composites of NR and graphitic NCs were
produced, combining synergistically the properties of the two materials,
thereby extending their application possibilities while maintaining
their low cost and sustainability. The resulting composites gain 11
orders of magnitude conductivity with only 10 wt % NC loading. Furthermore,
they show a good piezoelectric behavior and might be used to monitor
mechanical deformation.12

Results and Discussion
Characterization
of the NC in Dispersions and of the NC/NR Composites
Previous
analysis of the NCs and their dispersions had showed the
NC particles to be multilayer graphene particles, in turbostratic
packing (uncorrelated layers) with narrow lateral size distribution
around 60 and 3 nm average thickness (ca. nine graphene layers). Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
method shows a specific surface area of 153 m2·g–1.19 Raman spectra of pure
NR, a representative composite, purified NC powder, and a dried NC
dispersion are shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Raman spectra of pure NR, a representative composite (7.5 wt %
NC/NR), dried NC dispersion, and initial purified NC powder.

The powder exhibits the G, D,
and 2D band characteristics of its
graphitic nature. Detailed Raman analysis of the NC powder has been
performed in two previous studies.19,20 In the spectrum
of the dried NC dispersion, a slight shift of D, G, and 2D bands of
2–3 cm–1 is revealed. This shift could occur
due to the surfactant that surrounds the particles. The Raman spectrum
of the rubber composite shows both of the bands derived from the NC
and NR. Further evidence of the presence of both NR and NC in the
composites was acquired by performing X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis.
Diffractograms of the pure polymer, composites, dry NC dispersion,
NC powder, and surfactants were measured, as shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 XRD spectra of pure NR,
composites, dried NC dispersion, and initial
purified NC powder.

NR shows a characteristic
halo of amorphous materials with a maximum
at around 18.5°. All of the composites show the same halo-shaped
spectrum. However, as the filler concentration increases, the peak
that derives from NC (ca. 25.6°) becomes obvious, and its intensity
increases as a function of the amount of additive. The presence of
the surfactant peaks (18.99° and 23.13°) in the spectra
of the composites with higher carbon concentrations (7.5 and 10 wt
%) is noticeable. The morphology and the state of dispersion of the
NC particles in the rubber were assessed by transmission electron
microscopy (TEM). Figure 3 illustrates the images of the neat polymer, a representative
composite (with 5 wt % NC), and the composite with the highest amount
of filler (10 wt % NC) at two different magnifications (TEM images
of all composites are in the Supporting Information).

Figure 3 TEM images of NR, 5 wt % NC/NR, and 10 wt % NC/NR. Inset: TEM image
of 10 wt % NC/NR in higher magnification.

The presence and absence of the NC particles are obvious
from the
images of the composites and pure rubber, respectively. The TEM image
at higher resolution provides evidence of the presence of fully exfoliated
graphene sheets in the matrix (inset—graphene layers appear
almost transparent). The difference in the filler concentration results
in the formation of a network, most prominent for 10 wt % NC/NR composite.
These morphological differences influence the composites properties
as discussed below.

Further characterization of the composites
was provided via peak
force atomic force microscopy (AFM). In Figure 4, the images of the 10 wt % NC/NR composite
are depicted.

Figure 4 Peak force AFM images of 10 wt % NC/NR composite. In all
three
images, the NC and polymer component are marked with white and blue
circles, respectively. (a) Topography, (b) Young’s modulus,
and (c) adhesion.

The AFM topography (Figure 4a) gives an indication
of the roughness of the material. Figure 4b,c shows, respectively,
the difference in Young’s modulus and the adhesion between
the soft material (NR) and the harder one, the NC fillers. The lighter
parts in Figure 4b
represent materials with higher mechanical response whereas the darker
parts are of lower modulus. In contrast, the lighter parts in Figure 4c indicate higher
adhesion with the tip, and the darker areas indicate the part where
there is less tip–sample interaction. Peak force modulus image
of 10 wt % NC/NR composite is shown in Figure 4b. The polymer matrix presents a low modulus
structure (dark-colored areas). Many bright-colored areas ascribed
to the NC particles that are located close to the sample surface can
be seen. The NC network can be detected by the peak force AFM technique
because of their significantly higher Young’s modulus than
that of NR matrix. The adhesion image (Figure 4c) clearly differentiates the substrate from
the NC particles. The soft polymer interacts with the tip (lighter
colored areas), whereas the harder material (NC) does not (darker
colored areas). The corresponding topography image (Figure 4a) does not show much contrast.
Furthermore, from Figure 4c by a rough estimation, the NC particles size has been found
to be about 50 nm which is in excellent agreement with the size analysis
results of the NC aqueous dispersion.19

Properties of the NC/NR Composites
Thermal Properties
A thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
under air was carried out to estimate the influence of the NC additive
on the thermal stability of the polymer. Three to five samples of
each composite have been tested to obtain reliable results. All thermograms
are shown in Figure S2 where the same trend
of the thermal decomposition rate is presented for each composite. Figure 5 illustrates the
thermograms of NR and composites.

Figure 5 TGA thermograms of neat NR and the NC/NR
composites.

The global compartment
is similar for NR and all four composites.
Initial degradation starts within the same 20° range; hence,
the inclusion of NCs neither perturbs nor improves the thermal stability
of the NR. At around 360 °C, a slower degradation rate occurs.
The samples decompose slowly by increasing the NC concentration in
the composite, an indication of the superior thermal properties of
the composites than that of pure polymer.

Electrical Properties
Rubbers have inherently low electrical
conductivity. A way to overcome this limitation is the addition of
conductive additives into the polymer matrix which leads to the conductive
materials. A number of works with remarkable results have been carried
out using fillers from the family of carbon allotropes.6−8Figure 6 (top) shows
the ac conductivity as a function of frequency of NR and the NC/NR
composites. The ac conductivity of the rubber is very low, approximately
10–10 S·m–1. A nearly linear
increase is observed for the conductivity as a function of frequency
for NR under log–log conditions due to the contribution of
bound charges. Owing to the absence of conductive paths deriving from
the fillers, the conductivity is dominated by polarization effects
occurring in the polymer, which highly depends on the frequency. Therefore,
a frequency-dependent ac conductivity is observed. By adding as little
as 2 wt % of NCs, the increase of conductivity with frequency, typical
of a dielectric matrix, is transformed to an almost constant ac conductivity,
associated with a conducting behavior. Likewise, the bulk ac conductivity
is increased by 4 orders of magnitude. Further addition of NCs leads
to higher and higher conductivity values, the 10 wt % composites reaching
σ = 7.5 S·m–1, that is, 11 orders of
magnitude higher than the pristine rubber (Figure 6, bottom).

Figure 6 Top: ac conductivity as a function of
frequency for the neat NR
and NC/NR composites. Bottom: ac conductivity as a function of filler
concentration at a frequency of 10 Hz.

By adding NC fillers, a conductive network is formed breaking
down
the dielectric nature of the elastomer, even at low concentrations,
therefore inducing an increase of the conductivity via the contribution
of free charges brought by the fillers. Clearly, the results indicate
that NC additives enhance the electrical conductivity of rubber. Moreover,
NC fillers compare very well with commercial fillers, showing conductivity
that is several orders of magnitude higher for the same amount of
loading (Figure 7).6−8 The conductivity data do not follow percolation behavior but rather
a continuous increase of conductivity with filler fraction as has
been previously reported by Parant et al. where it was ascribed to
fractal filler networks.21 This behavior
shows that the conductivity probably follows a more complicated law
than a simple percolation law.22,23

Figure 7 Comparison of our observed
conductivity with values from the literature.
CB: carbon black, NR: natural rubber, SBR: styrene–butadiene
rubber, CNTs: carbon nanotubes, RGO: reduced graphene oxide, GnPs:
graphene platelets, FGS: functionalized graphene sheets.

In Figure 7, the
values of conductivity have been plotted for composites containing
different carbon concentrations of various carbon fillers.

It
is immediately apparent that NCs appear far more efficient than
other low anisometry fillers such as CB, with 5 to 7 orders of magnitude
better bulk conductivities. Moreover, NC performs similar to multiwalled
CNTs, when their anisometry is far lower (10 against 1000). Finally,
to reach the conductivity values as high as that obtained with 10
wt % NC, composites with commercial fillers must include as much as
25 wt % filler content,6,7 with the resulting penalties associated
with high filler content, such as cost and loss of the matrix elastic
(or other) properties.

There are several factors that contribute
to the high electrical
conductivity values of the NR/NC composites: (i) before its dispersion,
the NC has been thermally purified to remove the amorphous part and
therefore increase its conductivity,19 (ii)
these few layered graphene particles have no point defects at all20 and thus constitute a kind of ideal conductive
filler, and (iii) Brij S 100 surfactant here leads to a nonoptimal
dispersion and hence partial aggregation leading to better conductivity.
Finally, it has previously been reported that the films made by filtering
the suspensions of these nanocarbons showed very good conductivity
up to 4000 S·m–1 and in an average of 100 S·m–1.19

Mechanical
Properties
The effect of the NC fillers
on the mechanical response was estimated by tensile testing. In Figure 8, the stress–strain
curves of the composites with low particle concentrations (2 and 5
wt %) follow the same behavior as that of the neat NR.

Figure 8 Representative stress–strain
curves of NC and NC/NR composites.
Inset: Young’s modulus as a function of NC concentration.

An increment in the tensile strength
is observed with further NC
addition, and the highest value for stress at the break of 0.6 MPa
(double than the NR) appears for 10 wt % filler. Moreover, the elastic
modulus increases. The Young’s modulus of the 7.5 and 10 wt
% composites, extracted from the initial slope of the stress–strain
graphs, is twice that of the neat polymer (inset of Figure 8). Table 1 discloses all mechanical results.

a Values were averaged
over 2–5
measurements (the numbers in brackets represent the standard deviation).
Values of E were calculated from eq 1.

The addition of particles in the composites enhances
the hardness
of the polymer. This is due to the hydrodynamic effect arising from
the inclusion of rigid particles into the soft rubber matrix. In this
perspective, the polymer is considered as a continuum, and attention
is focused on the effect of NC without taking into account the rubber
behavior at the molecular level. Therefore, the tensile strength is
higher by increasing the filler concentration, since more force is
needed for elongation.24 Moreover, as it
has also been observed in microscopy images, the contact of the particles
becomes higher by increasing their concentration in the composite.
The surfactant that has been used to prepare aqueous NC dispersions
could act as not a strong stabilizer when the particles are dispersed
in the soft matrix, resulting in the NC network formation. Another
possible reason could be related to processes that occur during the
drying of the composite. Following Bhattacharyya et al.,9 the experimental data have been fitted by the
hydrodynamical model of Einstein–Smallwood–Guth (eq 1).9,25 1  where f is the shape factor:
16.7 (50 nm lateral size and 3 nm width—considering individualized
particles) and φ is the volume fraction of the filler. The weight
fraction was transformed into the volume fraction by using the densities
of NR and graphite (for NR, the density was d = 0.93
g·cm–3 and for NC, d = 2.1
g·cm–3, close to that of graphite). The theoretical
and experimental values are in rather good agreement (cf. Table 1 and inset of Figure 8).

Piezoresistive
Properties
The dependence of the electrical
properties with mechanical deformation was determined by measuring
the change in resistance as the samples were elongated by applying
force in a tensile deformation. Figure 9 shows the change in resistance as a function of strain
for the composites with 10 wt % NC. Data were fitted according to
the model used by Knite et al.26 Tunneling
conductivity dominates with no apparent contribution of the destruction
of conducting networks upon strain (see the Supporting Information, Figure S7 and eq S1). Curves for the other samples
as well as a video that shows a representative piezoresistive measurement
are included in the Supporting Information.

Figure 9 Ratio of the change in resistance and the initial resistance and
gauge factor as a function of strain for 10 wt % NC/NR composite.
Inset: schematic representation of piezoresistive measurement. The
initial maximum of the gauge factor is reproducible. It may be linked
to an initial reorganization of the NC network as has been observed
in the case of CNT/poly(vinyl alcohol) fibers.27

In all samples, an increase in
the relative resistance (R – R0)/R0 is observed. To define
the sensitivity of the composites
as sensors of deformation, the gauge factor (defined as ΔR/(R0·ε), where ΔR is the change from zero-strain resistance (R0) and ε is the strain) has also been plotted in Figure 9 for the 10 wt %
NC/NR composites. The gauge factors of the other composites are presented
in the Supporting Information. For the
samples with NC concentration up to 5 wt %, a relatively low gauge
factor is observed. However, a better electrical sensitivity is obtained
for higher filler concentrations with very interesting results for
the 10 wt % NC/NR composite. Indeed, with a gauge factor of 20 (with
a stretchability of up to 225%.), the 10 wt % NC/NR composite could
be placed among the recently reported values of strain sensor devices
(variation from 14 to 62) which often required complicated preparation
procedures.28−31 These strain sensor devices have been used for real-time human motion
detection28,29 or for sensing various emotions.30 Moreover, possible applications in which strain
sensors could be used are in stretchable electronics, robotics, medical
diagnostics, and healthcare.28−31

Conclusions
The NC/NR composites
were successfully prepared from methane by
an environmentally friendly and sustainable procedure. NC appears
as a viable competitor compared to petrol-based CB. In particular,
highly conducting rubbers were obtained with only 10 wt % of NCs.
Furthermore, piezoresistive experiments have shown that the rubber
composites may be used as stress sensors with a gauge factor up to
20. The present availability of NCs actually coming from the methane/CO2 mix originating from food waste anaerobic digestion opens
exciting perspectives about sustainable multifunctional rubber composites.

Experimental
Section (Materials and Methods)
Materials
Nanocarbons were produced
by FGV Cambridge
Nanosystems via the cracking of CH4/CO2 by a
microwave plasma process. NCs were purified using heat treatment at
500 °C in air for 6 h to remove amorphous carbon.19 All of the water was deionized using a Milli-Q
system, and a nonionic surfactant, Brij S 100, was used as received
from Sigma-Aldrich to disperse purified NC. The polymer used to prepare
the composite is an NR latex (NR, Tg:
−62 ± 1 °C, ζ: −80 ± 4 mV, solid
content: 62.4 ± 0.1 wt %) kindly supplied by Talismã (Mirassol,
Brazil). The NR latex has not been cured.

Equipment
TEM:
the internal structure and the state
of dispersion of the filler particles within the elastomeric matrix
were assessed via TEM using a Hitachi 7650 operating at 80 kV. Ultrathin
sections (70 × 70 nm2) of the composites were microtomed
using a cryo ultramicrotome Leica UC7 equipped with a cryo diamond
knife DiATOME at −120 °C and with a knife angle at 35°.
The thin cuts were put on holey carbon grids.

Peak force microscopy:
mechanical response and adhesion differences between the matrix and
the additives were evaluated via peak AFM in ambient air in tapping
mode. A peak force AFM on Icon microscopy was used. The tip was calibrated
just before the experiment. An ultrathin section was used and prepared
as described above for the TEM analysis. The cut was placed onto an
aluminum substrate.

Raman spectroscopy was carried out on a
HORIBA Jobin-Yvon Xplora
microscope with a cooled Andor CCD detector and a laser spot size
of ∼1 μm. The spectra were recorded at an excitation
wavelength of 532 nm and calibrated with highly oriented pyrolytic
graphite.

XRD: X-ray diffractograms were acquired with a PANalitycal
X’pert
MPD-PRO Bragg–Brentano θ–θ geometry diffractometer
equipped with a secondary monochromator. The Cu Kα radiation
(λ: 1.5418 Å) was generated at 45 kV and 40 mA. The spectra
were obtained within a range 2θ: 8°–80° with
an acquisition time of 2 h and 5 min. The samples were placed on a
silicon wafer (“zero background”) sample holder and
flattened with a piece of glass when required.

TGA was performed
using a SETARAM instrument equipped with a two-balance
setup for equilibration under air. The samples of weights around 10
mg were collected on a Pt-holder and heated at a rate of 5 °C/min.

AC conductivity of the composites was measured as a function of
frequency with a model M2 Materials Mates 7260 Impedance Analyzer
at room temperature (frequency range: 10 Hz to 1 MHz). Prior to the
measurements, samples of 10 × 10 × 0.5 mm were gold-metallized
and then sandwiched between the two electrodes in a cell. A parallel
resistor–capacitor equivalent circuit was used to describe
the samples which could be considered as plane capacitors. The dc
resistance value was extrapolated from the measured ac resistance
values. The conductivity was deduced from eq 2.32−34 2  where z′ and z″ are the real and imaginary parts of the impedance,
respectively; S is the surface area (cross-sectional
area); and d is the distance between the two electrodes.

The mechanical response of the neat NR and the composites was estimated
from the stress–strain curves acquired using a Zwick Roell
tensile machine at a strain rate of 1 mm·min–1. Stress is defined as the force applied to elongate the sample divided
by the section and, strain is the change in the length while the specimen
is stretched divided by the initial length. Three to four specimens
were tested for each sample and the reported values were the representative
results. The Young’s modulus was extracted from the slope of
the stress–strain plots in the Hooke’s region (elastic
part).

Moreover, the change on resistivity as a function of
deformation
(piezoresistivity) was determined after following the change in resistance
(R) with a Keithley 6517A multimeter during the elongation
of the rubbers until breakage. The connection of the samples with
the electrodes was achieved by using silver paint and copper wire
(inset to Figure 9).
The gauge factor, g, (ratio of the change in resistance
to the strain) was determined from the slope of the elastic part of
the curve as shown in eq 3. 3  where ε
is the strain and R0 is the resistance
for the initial length.

The resistivity (ρ) was calculated
by taking into account
the dimensions of the samples and considering the volume (V) constant (eqs 4 and 5) (safe assumption for high strains). 4   5  

From eqs 4 and 5, we
obtain eq 6 6  where l is the length.

Preparations
NC Dispersion
Purified NCs (0.32 g; 3.2 wt %) were
dispersed in 9.67 g of water using 0.05 g of Brij S 100 (0.5 wt %)
as the surfactant. The dispersion was homogenized with a Branson Digital
Sonifier tip sonicator, applying for 30 min a total energy of 14.4
kJ in an interval mode (pulse on: 0.5 s and pulse off: 0.2 s). The
resulting dispersion was then centrifuged for 20 min at 4000 rpm (2486g) with a Fisher Bioblock Scientific centrifuge to remove
the largest particles (aggregates) to obtain a monodisperse suspension
of NC. After this step, the supernatant was freeze-dried to determine
the NC yield. The final concentrations were 17 mg·mL–1 of NC (1.7 wt %, 53% yield) and 5 mg·mL–1 of Brij S 100 (0.5 wt %). The electrical conductivity value of the
films made from such NC dispersions has been reported in a previous
work and is approximately 1 Ohm·cm.19 To prepare NR composites, adapted volumes of supernatant were directly
used.

NC/NR Composites
Multifunctional composites with NR
were produced via an environmentally friendly route that some of the
coauthors of this article have developed with other carbon species
as CNTs or graphene, utilizing latex technology.10,13,35

For the preparation of the composites,
appropriate volumes of NC aqueous dispersion (ca. 4 to 19 mL) were
directly mixed with NR latex (solid content 62.4 wt %) under magnetic
stirring (30 min, 2000 rpm). The mixture was then sonicated using
a bath sonicator (Branson 5200) for 10 min to remove the large bubbles
created by magnetic stirring. Afterward, the slurries were placed
onto molds and dried in an oven under vacuum at room temperature to
remove the bubbles for an hour and at 70 °C for 48 h. Five different
samples were prepared as control samples: an NR film without any additive,
referred as NR, and four samples with the following NC concentrations:
2, 5, 7.5, and 10 wt % referred to as: x wt % NC/NR
(x = 2, 5, 7.5, and 10 wt %).
