Herein, we report the synthesis and
neuroprotective power of some
N-substituted C-(dialkoxy)phosphorylated nitrones 4a–g, by studying their ability to increase
the cell viability, as well as their capacity to reduce necrosis and
apoptosis. We have identified (Z)-N-tert-butyl-1-(diethoxyphosphoryl)methanimine oxide
(4e) as the most potent, nontoxic, and neuroprotective
agent, with a high activity against neuronal necrotic cell death,
a result that correlates very well with its great capacity for the
inhibition of the superoxide production (72%), as well as with the
inhibition of lipid peroxidation (62%), and the 5-lipoxygenase activity
(45%) at 100 μM concentrations. Thus, nitrone 4e could be a convenient promising compound for further investigation.

1 Introduction
Reactive
oxygen species (ROSs) exert their physical functions at
low to moderate concentrations, but at high concentrations, they become
toxic for the living systems, resulting in oxidative stress (OS).1 Oxidative stress (OS) plays a key role in many
pathologies, being possibly the most important molecular event occurring
before and after ischemic damage.2 Aerobic
organisms have integrated antioxidant systems, which include enzymatic
and nonenzymatic antioxidants that are usually effective in blocking
harmful effects of ROS.3

In this
context, free radical scavengers, such as nitrones like NXY-059 (1) (Figure 1) (Cerovive, AstraZeneca),4,5 are
efficient neuroprotective agents in experimental ischemia studies.4 However, as NXY-059 (1) failed in advanced clinical trials for stroke, the neuroprotection
therapy strategy for cerebral ischemia based on antioxidants and nitrone
ROS scavenging agents has been critically analyzed and almost discontinued.6

Figure 1 Structures of compounds 1–3 and
of the (diethoxyphosphoryl)nitrones (DEOPNs) 4a–e and (dibenzyloxyphosphoryl)nitrones (DBOPNs) 4f,g investigated in this work.

In spite of this, the impressive results that we have recently
published using novel quinolylnitrones mean that the structure and
functional groups incorporated in the nitrone cores have a critical
influence on their antioxidant and pharmacological properties7 and that there is still place for novelty and
originality in this area of medicinal chemistry. On the other hand,
as the capability of phosphorylated nitrones DEPMPO 2(8) and 2-(diethoxyphosphoryl)-N-(benzylidene)propan-2-amine oxide derivatives 3(9) (Figure 1) to trap various radicals has been well recognized, all of
these observations inspired us to study the antioxidant properties
of the N-substituted C-dialkoxyphosphorylated nitrones 4a–g, including the (diethoxyphosphoryl)nitrones
(DEOPNs) 4a–e and (dibenzyloxyphosphoryl)nitrones
(DBOPNs) 4f,g (Figure 1), and their neuroprotective properties.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Chemistry
The
phosphorylated nitrones 4a–d were
synthesized from hydroxymethylphosphonate
(5) by Swern oxidation and subsequent reaction with the
respective hydroxylamine10−12 (Scheme 1), whereas nitrones 4e and 4f,g have been synthesized here for the first
time in an analogous manner starting from diethyl hydroxymethylphosphonate
(5) and dibenzyl hydroxymethylphosphonate (6), respectively (Supporting Information). According to our previous observations, crystalline DEOPN 4a exists as a Z isomer, whereas in chloroform-d as well as in benzene-d6 solutions
at room temperature, a 15:85 equilibrium mixture of E/Z isomers was noticed (1H NMR analysis).10 Similarly, DEOPN 4b exists as a
14:86 mixture of E/Z isomers.10 On the other hand, both (R)-
and (S)-configured DEOPNs 4c and 4d in chloroform-d solution form 7:93 mixtures
of E/Z isomers.11 Nitrones 4f and 4g in deuterated
chloroform solutions form equilibrium mixtures of E/Z isomers, 10:90 and 5:95, respectively, whereas
nitrone 4e exists as only a Z isomer.
Surprisingly, all of the phosphorylated nitrones 4a–g exist as Z isomers in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) and less than 2% of E-isomers could be detected
with a 600 MHz NMR spectrometer.

2.2 Neuroprotective Effect of N-Substituted C-Dialkoxyphosphorylated Nitrones
Following the
usual protocols (see the Supporting Information), we obtained the cell viability and neuroprotection values shown
in Table 1 and Figure 2. Based on these
results, we conclude that all of the nitrones showed moderate neuroprotective
values, in the micromolar range, from 10.62 (4e) to 131.21
(4c). Second, by comparing with the EC50 determined
for the standard compounds α-phenyl-tert-butyl
nitrone (PBN), citicoline (CCh), and N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), it is clear that most of the nitrones 4, with the exception of 4a and 4c, are more neuroprotective than PBN and CCh but less
than NAC.

a Data are given

analysis of variance (ANOVA) test. Differences were considered to
be statistically significant when P ≤ 0.05.
EC50’s were calculated from data obtained from three
experiments made in triplicate on cells from four different cultures.
ns: nonsignificant; *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001; compared with the
basal value.

Among the DEOPNs 4a–e, on going
from nitrone 4a (R = Me, EC50 = 98.30 μM)
to nitrones 4b or 4e, the incorporation
of benzyl or t-butyl motifs, respectively, instead
of the methyl group, produces strong positive neuroprotective responses,
affording the two most neuroprotective agents discovered in this work.
Very interestingly, the α-substitution on nitrone 4b by a methyl group significantly decreases the neuroprotection observed
for this nitrone, more strongly in the (R)-enantiomer 4c than in the (S)-enantiomer 4d. However, nitrones 4b and (S)-4d have a lower maximal activity than (R)-4c, which shows a lower neuroprotection. This is possibly
due to the fact that at high concentrations both nitrones are more
toxic than (R)-4c. This result is very
interesting, showing that the absolute configuration at the stereogenic
center has an influence on the neuroprotection, but unfortunately
we have no explanation for this fact.

This could also be supported
by the results of the effect of these
nitrones on the necrotic and apoptotic cell death tests (Figure 3a,b, see below).
By comparing DEOPNs 4a,b with the corresponding
DBOPNs 4f,g, we conclude that nitrone 4f is 2.2-fold more potent than nitrone 4a (P < 0.01) but that nitrone 4b has a neuroprotective
potency very similar to that of nitrone 4g (nonstatistically
significant). However, DBOPNs 4f,g have
a maximal neuroprotective effect higher than those of their corresponding
DEOPNs 4a,b, indicating that the addition
of a benzyloxy group, instead of an ethoxy group, affords less toxicity
at high concentration.

Figure 3 Effect of nitrones on (A) lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
release or
(B) caspase-3 activity in SHY5Y human neuroblastoma cell cultures
exposed to oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD). The bar chart
shows the percentage of LDH release at 24 h of recovery after (A)
3 h OGD or (B) caspase-3 activity (AFU/μg protein/h), either
untreated (R24h) or treated with different concentrations (μM)
of nitrones 4a–g or NAC and PBN. The value induced by OGD at 3 h without the recovery
period (OGD3h) is also indicated. LDH release corresponding to R24h
cells exposed to 3 h OGD and 24 h of reperfusion (R24h) (3.78 ±
0.48%) was considered as 100%. The values represent the average of
three independent experiments (mean ± SEM) at *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001 vs R24h by one-way analysis of variance followed by Holm–Sidak’s
post-test, when analysis of variance was significant. Statistical
significances above the R24h value are not shown.

To shed light on the neuroprotective effects of nitrones 4a–g, the effect of these compounds on
necrotic and apoptotic cellular death was measured by monitoring lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) release (necrosis) and caspase-3 activity (apoptosis)
from the cultured human neuroblastoma cells.

Results from Figure 3 show that exposure
of SHSY5Y cultures to 4 h OGD (OGD4h) followed
by 24 h reperfusion (R24h) induced a significant increase in LDH release
(3.78 ± 0.48%, about 4-fold of the control values; P < 0.001, Student’s t-test) (Figure 3A). These increasing
LDH release values correlate with the loss in cell viability observed
under this condition (about 35%). Exposure of neuroblastoma cell cultures
to just 4 h OGD (OGD4h) also induced a statistically significant increase
in LDH release (5.48 ± 0.68%, mean ± SEM) when compared
with control of 4 h reperfusion (C) (1.38 ± 0.20%), which is
about 45% higher than that induced by IR. This means that, during
the OGD treatment, neurons suffered cellular membrane damage, which
is partially repaired during reperfusion, parallel to a reduction
in cell viability loss of about 30% during the IR condition. The presence
of some nitrones 4 during this period reversed the necrotic
death in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 3A). The neuroprotective effects of nitrones,
at concentrations from 1 to 500 μM, on necrotic cell death were
assayed by adding them at the beginning of the reperfusion period.
Their effect was compared with the neuroprotective effect of NAC,
from 1 to 500 μM doses, showing a decrease in LDH release in
a dose-dependent manner, having then a significant neuroprotective
effect at concentrations between 10 and 500 μM (ranging from
59 to 100% of maximal reduction) (Figure 3A).

The addition of 10–500 μM
nitrone 4e produced
a reduction of necrotic cell death, in the same range as NAC (from
55 to 100% LDH release inhibition), thus being the most potent neuroprotective
nitrone, followed by nitrone 4a (52–70% inhibition),
indicating that the substitution of Me by the t-Bu
group increases the neuroprotective and antinecrotic effect. Nitrones 4b–d were also able to reduce LDH release
induced by IR in a dose-dependent manner, although nitrone 4c, nitrone 4b, at 100 μM dose, or nitrone 4d, at 100 and 500 μM concentrations, did not reduce
the LDH release, indicating that, similar to the observed antioxidant
and neuroprotective effects, both nitrones are toxic at these concentrations.
In general, DEOPNs 4a,b have a neuroprotective
effect higher than that of their corresponding DBOPNs, indicating
that the addition of a benzyloxy group, instead of the ethoxy, decreases
their antinecrotic cell death activity.

The observed high antinecrotic
cell death capacity of these nitrones
contrasts with their weak capacity to reduce apoptotic cell death.
An increase in caspase-3 activity is correlated with apoptosis. Thus,
to know whether these nitrones reduce apoptosis induced by experimental
ischemia, the caspase-3 activity was measured.

As shown in Figure 3B, the reduction
in caspase-3 activity induced by the nitrones, NAC,
and PBN was very small, and only at high concentrations
(100–500 μM), an antiapoptotic effect was observed. In
general, DBOPNs 4f,g seem to be less antiapoptotic
than their analogues DEOPNs, indicating that the incorporation of
a benzyloxy group, instead of an ethoxy group, decreases not only
their antinecrotic but also their antiapoptotic cell death activity.
It is interesting to note that the introduction of a t-Bu group in nitrone 4e, the best neuroprotective nitrone
in our hands, has an opposite antinecrotic or antiapoptotic effect.
Thus, while this chemical modification increases the antinecrotic
effect, it decreases its antiapoptotic effect, as shown by comparing
these activities between nitrones 4a and 4e.

To sum up, taken together all of these results of neuroprotection,
antinecrotic, and antiapoptotic activities of the nitrones described
here, we conclude that the mechanism of their neuroprotective activity
might be related to their antinecrotic actions more than their antiapoptotic
activity.

2.3 Antioxidant Assays: ROS Production in Cultures
of SHSY5Y Human Neuroblastoma Cells
It is well documented
that nitrones NXY-059 and PBN have good
antioxidant properties.13,14 To analyze the antioxidant
capacity of nitrones 4 and explore whether ROS could
be involved in their neuroprotective actions, ex vivo experiments
were carried out, following the usual protocols (Supporting Information), to evaluate the effect of these nitrones
on ROS production in cultures of SHSY5Y human neuroblastoma cells,
under oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) conditions, using PBN, NAC, and CCh for comparative purposes and sodium nitroprusside
(SNP) as the positive control.

To address this issue, we monitored
superoxide production by a fluorimetric assay. SHSY5Y neuroblastoma
cells in the culture had a basal superoxide production rate of 0.76
± 0.072 AFU/min × 2 × 105 cells (n = 10; Figure 4A). OGD (3 h) and IR (3 h reperfusion after 3 h OGD) caused
an increase in the rate of O2•– production (Figure 4A), reaching values of 1.73 ± 0.18 and 2.59 ± 0.278 AFU/min
× 2 × 105 cells (n = 10), respectively,
values similar to that obtained for 3 h of cell treatment with 2 mM
SNP. Nitrone 4e reduced IR-induced superoxide production
in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in the 100% inhibition at 1
mM concentration (0.82 ± 0.091 AFU/min × 2 × 105 cells; P < 0.001, ANOVA test) (Figure 4A, inset). Results of Figure 4B show that all of the nitrones were able
to reduce ROS levels measured by a dihydroethidium (DHE) probe. After
reperfusion (IR) for 3 h and 3 h under OGD conditions, ROS levels
were significantly increased 2.5-fold with respect to the control
and also significantly higher than in the OGD conditions alone. Nitrones
showed antioxidant power, ranging from a reduction of about 30–35%
for nitrones 4a and 4c, 60–65% for
nitrones 4d and 4f (0.1 mM concentrations),
and 40–45% for nitrones 4a,b,d or 70–80% for the most potent antioxidant nitrones 4e and 4f (at 1 mM concentration). In the case
of nitrones 4b and 4d, an inverse relationship
exists between the nitrone concentration and antioxidant activity,
indicating thus a possible toxic effect at concentrations higher than
1 mM. These results confirm that the antioxidant power of the nitrones
tested here translates into their neuroprotective activity (see below).
Interestingly, nitrone 4f is one of the most potent antioxidant
nitrones in the ex vivo analysis, especially at a high, 1 mM, concentration,
showing ROS (%) reduced values higher than those observed for PBN, NAC, and CCh (Figure 4B).

Figure 4 Inhibitory effects of nitrones 4 on ROS (superoxide)
production in SHSY5Y human neuroblastoma cell cultures exposed to
OGD 3 and 3 h reperfusion (IR). (A) Rate of experimental ischemia
and reperfusion-induced superoxide production. ROS production was
determined as indicated in Methods. The
slopes of the lines fitting the fluorescence intensity changes (an
index of the rate of superoxide production) were individually calculated
and averaged. The mean slope values were used to generate a theoretical
line using the following equation: y = ax. The figure represents the generated lines for superoxide production
in untreated cells and in the presence of OGD, IR, and SNP as a positive
control. The inset represents the effect of 0.1 and 1 mM nitrone 4e on superoxide production induced by experimental ischemia
(OGD + reperfusion; IR). (B) Effect of nitrones 4 on
the ROS levels induced by IR. The bars show the percentage of ROS
obtained by the IR treatment in the absence and presence of the indicated
concentrations of nitrones, PBN, NAC, and CCh. The data
represent the mean ± SEM of three determinations, each performed
in triplicate (n = 9). The statistics compare the
effect of the OGD or IR over their respective controls at 3 and 3
+ 3 h, respectively (*red), or the effect of the different compounds
on the IR condition (*black) to ***P < 0.001 (one-way
ANOVA, followed by Holm–Sidak analysis as a post hoc test).
SNP (1–2 mM) was used as a positive control of ROS formation.

We observed that, among DEOPNs 4a–e, nitrones 4d and 4e are the most potent
antioxidants. The incorporation of benzyl or t-butyl
motifs, instead of the methyl group, seems to increase the antioxidant
capacity of these nitrones, and the α-substitution on nitrone 4b by a methyl group significantly increases its antioxidant
capacity, more strongly in the resulting (R)-enantiomer 4c than in the (S)-enantiomer 4d. However, both nitrones 4b and the (S)-enantiomer 4d show less antioxidant activity at 1
mM than at 0.1 mM concentrations, which is possibly due to the fact
that at high concentrations both nitrones are more toxic than (R)-enantiomer nitrone 4c. By comparing DEOPNs 4a and 4b with the corresponding DBOPNs 4f and 4g, we conclude that nitrone 4f is 2-fold more potent than nitrone 4a (R = Me) (P < 0.01) but that nitrone 4b has a neuroprotective
potency very similar to that of nitrone 4g (R = Bn) (nonstatistically
significant).

Very interestingly, the most potent neuroprotective
nitrone 4e shows high values for the inhibition of the
lipid peroxidation
(LP) (62%), inhibition of the 5-lipoxygenase (LOX) (45%), and lipophilicity
(Clog P = 2.04) (Table 2). These results are in good agreement with
its capacity to inhibit superoxide production shown in the ex vivo
experiments (about 100% at 1 mM; Figure 4A,B). Thus, the antioxidant properties of
these nitrones could be strongly involved in their neuroprotective
effects.

3 Conclusions
We report herein the synthesis
and neuroprotective properties of
some N-substituted C-dialkoxyphosphorylated nitrones 4, easily available in good yields from commercial starting
materials. Regarding the neuroprotection analysis, DEOPNs t-butyl nitrone 4b and benzyl nitrone 4e have been identified as good neuroprotective nitrones,
although in the case of nitrone 4b, no clear trends have
been observed to correlate these results with its antioxidant capacity.
The replacement of a methyl group with a t-butyl
or benzyl group improves the neuroprotective power of the corresponding
nitrone. Similarly, the replacement of the benzyl with a methyl group
reduces the neuroprotective capacity, resulting in less-potent nitrones 4c and 4d, where we have observed that the (S)-enantiomer is 4.2-fold more potent than the (R)-enantiomer. To sum up, DEOPN 4e has been
identified as the most potent neuroprotective, antinecrotic agent
investigated here, showing the capacity to inhibit LP and decrease
superoxide levels in neuronal cultures, and consequently deserves
further investigation. The etiology and origin of stroke, as a complex
and multifactorial disease, is unknown. However, as the oxidative
stress is thought to play a key role, among other factors, we have
tried to explain the observed neuroprotective effect by nitrone 4e on these grounds but without excluding other factors and
mechanisms being involved.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Chemistry: General Methods
1H NMR spectra
were recorded in CDCl3 on the following
spectrometers: Varian Mercury-300 and Bruker Avance III (600 MHz)
with tetramethylsilane as the internal standard. 13C NMR
spectra were recorded for CDCl3 solution on the Varian
Mercur-300 machine at 75.5 MHz, whereas for DMSO solution on Bruker
Avance III at 151.0 MHz. IR spectra were recorded on an Infinity MI-60
FT-IR spectrometer. Melting points were determined on Boetius apparatus
and were uncorrected. Elemental analyses were carried out on a PerkinElmer
PE 2400 CHNS analyzer. The following adsorbents were used: column
chromatography, Merck silica gel 60 (70–230 mesh); analytical
TLC, Merck TLC plastic sheets silica gel 60 F254.

4.2 General Method for the Synthesis of Nitrones
To a stirred
solution of oxalyl chloride (0.210 mL, 2.48 mmol)
in CH2Cl2 (5 mL) under an argon atmosphere,
DMSO (0.360 mL, 5.15 mmol) dissolved in CH2Cl2 (1.5 mL) was added dropwise at −60 °C. After 30 min,
a solution of the appropriate dialkoxy hydroxymethylphosphonate 5 or 6 (2.0 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (2 mL) was added followed by triethylamine (0.850 mL, 6.00 mmol)
and the respective alkylhydroxylamine (2.0 mmol). The cooling bath
was removed, and saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (10 mL) was added
when the temperature of the reaction mixture reached 0 °C. The
aqueous layer was extracted with CH2Cl2 (3 ×
5 mL), and the organic phases combined were washed with brine, dried
(MgSO4), and concentrated to yield the crude nitrone 4, which was purified by column chromatography using a chloroform–MeOH
mixture (50:1). More details about these methods are briefly described
in the Supporting Information.

4.3 Antioxidant “in Vitro” Assays
In vitro
inhibition of linoleic acid peroxidation and soybean-lipoxygenase
was evaluated spectrophotometrically as reported previously.15 These methods are briefly described in the Supporting Information.

4.4 Neuroprotection
Assays
4.4.1 Neuroblastoma Cell Cultures
The
human neuroblastoma cell line SHSY5Y was cultured in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium: Ham’s F12 medium as described
in ref (16). For assays,
SHSY5Y cells were subcultured in 96- or 48-well plates at a seeding
density of (0.50–1) or (2–2.5) × 105 cells per well, respectively. When the SHSY5Y cells reached 80%
confluence, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 0.01
μM to 10 mM compound concentrations or PBS in the controls,
as indicated in each assay.

4.4.2 Neuroblastoma Cell Culture
Exposure to Oxygen–Glucose
Deprivation (OGD)
Neuroblastoma cell cultures
were exposed to OGD so as to induce cellular damage (experimental
ischemia). Cultured cells were washed and placed in glucose-free Dulbecco’s
medium and maintained in an anaerobic chamber containing a gas mixture
of 95% N2/5% CO2 and humidified at 37 °C,
as described in ref (17). Cells were exposed to OGD for a period of 3–4 h (OGD4h),
as indicated. Then, the culture medium was replaced with oxygenated
serum-free medium and cells were placed and maintained in the normoxic
incubator for 24 h for recovery (R24h). Nitrones were analyzed independently
three to five times with different batches of cultures, and each experiment
was run in triplicate.

4.4.3 Assessment of Cell Viability
Measurements
of cell viability in human SHSY5Y neuroblastoma cells (about (0.75–1)
× 105 cells/well) were carried out in 96-well culture
plates by the XTT methods, as described in ref (17).17

4.4.4 Measurement of LDH Activity
For
these assays, cultured neuroblastoma cells grown in 96-well culture
dishes at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells/well were used.
LDH activity was measured as the rate of decrease of the absorbance
at 340 nm, resulting from the oxidation of NADH to NAD+ as described.17 Data are given as the
percentage of LDH release with respect to the total LDH content (LDH
in the culture medium and LDH inside the cells).

4.4.5 Analysis of Caspase-3 Activity
For these assays, cultured
neuroblastoma cells grown in 48-well culture
dishes, at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/well, were
used. After OGD treatment, cells were treated with different nitrones
or indicated positive controls at 1–500 μM concentrations
and subjected to 24 h reperfusion. Attached cells were lysed at 4
°C in a lysis medium containing 5 mM Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 20 mM
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and 0.5% Triton X-100 and centrifuged
at 13 000g for 10 min. The activity of caspase-3
was measured using the fluorogenic substrate peptide DEVD-amc (66081;
BD Biosciences PharMingen), as described in refs17, 18. Proteins were measured by the Bradford
assay. Results were expressed as arbitrary fluorescence units [(AFU)/μg
protein/h].

4.4.6 Measurement of ROS Formation
SHSY5Y
human neuroblastoma cells (2 × 105 cells/well) were
exposed to OGD for a period of 3 h (OGD3h). At the end of the OGD
period, the culture medium was replaced with oxygenated Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium containing glucose and 10% fetal calf
serum. Cells were treated in the absence (controls) or presence of
indicated concentrations of nitrones or different known neuroprotective
agents and maintained at 37 °C in a normoxic incubator for 3
h for recovery. At the end of this period, 20 μM DHE (HEt; Molecular
Probes) was added and fluorescence was recorded every 15–30
s during a 15 min period, using an excitation filter of 535 nm and
an emission filter of 635 nm in a spectrofluorimeter (Bio-Tek FL 600)
as previously described.18,19 Linear regression of
fluorescence data [expressed as arbitrary fluorescence units (AFU)]
was calculated for each condition, and the slopes (a) of the best fitting lines (y = ax) were considered as an index of O2•– production. SNP was used as a positive control of superoxide production.19

4.5 Statistical Analysis
Data were expressed
as mean ± SEM of results obtained from at least three independent
experiments from different cultures, each of which was performed in
triplicate. Statistical comparisons between the different experimental
conditions were performed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA),
followed by Holm–Sidak’s post-test when the analysis
of variance was significant. A P-value <0.05 was
considered statistically significant. Fit curves for EC50 determinations were performed according to the program of SigmaPlot
v.11 (Systat Software INC., 2012).
