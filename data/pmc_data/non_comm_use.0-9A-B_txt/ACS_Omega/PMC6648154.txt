A spoof
fingerprint was fabricated on paper and applied for a spoofing
attack to unlock a smartphone on which a capacitive array of sensors
had been embedded with a fingerprint recognition algorithm. Using
an inkjet printer with an ink made of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), we
printed a spoof fingerprint having an electrical and geometric pattern
of ridges and furrows comparable to that of the real fingerprint.
With this printed spoof fingerprint, we were able to unlock a smartphone
successfully; this was due to the good quality of the printed CNT
material, which provided electrical conductivities and structural
patterns similar to those of the real fingerprint. This result confirms
that inkjet-printing CNTs to fabricate a spoof fingerprint on paper
is an easy, simple spoofing route from the real fingerprint and suggests
a new method for outputting the physical ridges and furrows on a two-dimensional
plane.

Introduction
Since
the 1980s, inkjet printers became the most commonly used
type of printers. However, inkjet printing using the diverse materials
as ink is a relatively new technology, providing a great opportunity
for various applications such as electronic circuits,1 batteries,2 semiconductors,3 optical devices,4,5 microfluidics,6−9 and sensors.10−13 Inkjet printing allows a specific design to be printed with high
resolution in a simple, fast, low-cost process and with low material
waste.14−17 Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are common materials used for printing conductive
circuits and sensors because they have good electrical conductivity,
high surface sensing area, and high stability and because they can
be dispersed in a typical solvent.15,18−23 Kwon et al. successfully formulated CNT ink for inkjet printing
and used the ink for printing simple conductive electrodes and digital
microfluidic chips on paper.6,7,24

Physiological biometric traits, such as the characteristics
of
one’s face, iris, hand, finger-vein, and fingerprints, are
unique to an individual.25,26 Fingerprints have routinely
been used for personal identification since their first use by a French
police expert, A. Bertillon, in the 19th century; they have also been
used in China as signatures on legal documents for 3000 years.27−29 The fingerprint has become a highly secure biometric key for accessing
personal and financial information on smartphones equipped with cutting-edge
security features, including a fingerprint sensor and appropriate
software.

A possible way to attack such a fingerprint sensor
device is to
generate a spoof fingerprint from its owner’s latent fingerprint.30,31 Spoof fingerprints can be made using a molding method or an inkjet
printing method.30−34 In 2016, Cao reported an easy and simple spoofing attack to unlock
the home button (unlock button) of smartphones by using a spoof fingerprint
that had been fabricated with silver ink through inkjet printing.31

Herein, we report the results of our research
in which we investigated
a novel CNT ink that would allow a simpler, more easily accessible
way to fabricate a spoof fingerprint by using an inkjet printer. Furthermore,
the CNT-printed patterns have better flexibility and stability in
ambient conditions compared to metal-based ones, in addition to the
ease of use and economical advantages. We described in detail about
characterizations of the printed CNT patterns versus printing conditions
and image processing on an image of a latent fingerprint in order
to create a good spoof fingerprint. Finally, we used the printed spoof
fingerprint to attack successfully a smartphone with a fingerprint
sensor device (Figure 1).

Results and Discussion
Inkjet-Printed CNT Ink on Paper
A CNT has a cylindrical
tube structure seamlessly rolled by using a graphene sheet, which
is a hexagonal lattice of carbon atoms. It has uniquely superior mechanical,
electrical, optical, and thermal properties that depend on its characteristics,
such as its length, diameter, rolling-up geometry as well as the presence
of functional ligands.35,36 The diameter and length of a
CNT were measured by using ImageJ software in a scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) image in Figure 2b. The results showed that the average diameter and
length of the CNT were about d < 50 nm and l = 0.92 ± 0.31 μm, respectively. The average
length of the CNT is one-twentieth of the 21 μm nozzle diameter,
allowing the inkjet printer to jet out the CNT ink without clogging.15,31 Using the fluidic parameters of our CNT ink, that is, a viscosity
of ∼2 cP and a surface tension of ∼40 mN/m, we determined
that the jetting condition of the inkjet printer was satisfied (Video Clip S1).24,37

Figure 2 (a) Dispersed
CNT ink for inkjet printing and (b) SEM image of
CNTs, showing their lengths (l) and diameters (d).

By using our prepared
CNT ink with its optimized properties, we
printed on paper CNT patterns with a fingerprint-like design (Figure 3a). The printed pattern
showed a clean edge that resulted from the optimum properties of the
ink, the inkjet printer, and the printing paper, which had a glossy
surface. After we had printed the design with CNT ink, we investigated
its morphology by using SEM. The SEM image showed the presence of
CNTs in the printed pattern aggregated on the glossy surface of the
paper (Figure 3b).
That aggregation of CNTs provided physical contact that allowed the
printed CNT pattern to conduct electricity. The printed CNT patterns
showed no hint of conductivity breakdown even after the bend cycles
for 500 times at a bend angle of 180°.

Figure 3 (a) Mimic design of fingerprint
patterns and a printed image of
the CNT pattern. (b) SEM image showing the surface morphologies of
the CNT pattern/printing paper (left) and high-magnification SEM image
of the CNTs (right).

An error in the printing of an aqueous ink by using the inkjet
printing method commonly causes the printed drop placement to be inaccurate
by about ±3 μm with a 300 μm throw distance, which
is the distance from the printhead to the printing substrate38 and a spreading of the printed drop on the printing
substrate through the wettability phenomena.39,40 These factors can make a printed pattern larger than its actual
design. To observe changes in the area of the patterns printed using
our setup, we designed a pattern with a total area of 1 mm2 (l = 5 mm, w = 0.2 mm) and printed
it from 1 to 10 times (Figure 4a inset). After the CNT patterns had been printed, we measured
the total area of the patterns by using ImageJ software. Data showed
that the total area of the printed pattern was larger than the actual
design by about 0.35 mm2 for one printing, increased to
about 0.60 mm2 for two printings, and continued to increase
slightly after the second printing (Figure 4a). Figure 4b shows the surface profiles of the CNT-printed patterns;
the height is seen to increase approximately from 0.3 to 1.7 μm
as the number of printings was increased from 1 to 10.

Figure 4 Properties of printed
CNT patterns as a function of printings:
(a) total area of the printed patterns, (b) surface profiles, and
(c) electrical surface sheet resistance vs number of printings.

Because the electrical conductivity
of a CNT pattern depends on
the printed CNT network, the conductivity of a CNT pattern can be
improved by increasing the number of printings. To investigate the
electrical conductivity of the CNT-printed patterns, we measured the
surface sheet resistance of a CNT electrode printed on paper as a
function of the number of printings. Figure 4c shows that the surface sheet resistance
of the printed CNT pattern is roughly 3.4 kΩ/sq for one printing,
decreases to about 0.6 kΩ/sq for five printings, and continues
to decrease slightly to 0.4 kΩ/sq as more printings are added.

Image Processing for a Spoof Fingerprint
In addition
to providing electrical similarity, in order to prepare a spoof fingerprint,
we performed an image transformation from the real fingerprint to
the fake fingerprint in four steps (Figure 3): capture, electronic transformation, image
processing, and printing.

Capture: Collecting a fingerprint
would be very complicated, complex forensic process if we tried to
get it non-noticeably or illegally from its owner without permission,
for example, by taking surreptitiously the fingerprint left on the
smartphone’s screen. In this study, we skipped this spoofing
step by directly copying the real fingerprint of the right index finger
in black stamp ink onto printing photo paper with a white background.
In the capture step, the tip of the finger was cleaned with alcohol,
covered with ink evenly, dried for about 30–60 s, and pressed
slightly so that the fingerprint was copied in ink onto the photo
paper. A precise copy of the patterns from the original fingerprint
was achieved by allowing the ink on the fingerprint to dry before
transferring it and using photo paper as a substrate.

Electronic
Transformation (Figure 5a): We used an office scanner for capturing a fingerprint
image with a scanning resolution of 500 dpi. The image should be scanned
in the range of 300 dpi or higher resolution. The images scanned with
different resolutions should be processed (contrast adjustment) in
the image processing step differently in order to obtain desired fingerprint
image.

Figure 5 Imaging process for generating a copy of a fingerprint by printing.
Fingerprint images obtained after (a) scanning and flipping horizontally
and (b) adjusting the contrast. (c) Higher-magnification image of
the printed fingerprint.

Image Processing (Figure 5b): Using ImageJ software, we modified the scanned
image to
obtain a good-quality fingerprint. Initially, the scanned image was
processed with the threshold option to adjust the contrast of the
image (contrast = 215) and to erase the blur, which had been created
mostly during the image capture and scanning steps. We also used the
threshold option to optimize the dimension of the printing ridge patterns
in order to generate an identically printed fingerprint. Because the
captured image was a mirror image of the real one, it was transformed
into the flip-horizontal image that was needed for the fake image
for our spoofing attack.

Printing (Figure 5c): We used an inkjet printer with CNT ink
to pattern the fingerprint
images on photo paper. To obtain good-quality printed patterns, we
set our printing condition to six printing nozzles, a 20 μm
drop spacing, and a 1270 dpi printing resolution.

Printed CNT
Pattern as a Spoof Fingerprint
A fingerprint
is composed of a series of friction ridges (500–700 μm
in width and 40–60 μm in height) and furrows on the epidermis
of the skin of the human finger.33,41,42 The uniqueness of a fingerprint is due to its overall
pattern of friction ridges and its minutiae, such as ending ridges,
deltas, bifurcations, dots, and lakes; moreover, a fingerprint does
not change and is specific to the individual such that it has used
for personal identification.28,29,41 In addition to its specific structures and shapes, a fingerprint
has an electrical property, that is, a resistance of about 2 kΩ
to 2 MΩ.43,44

In order to generate a
spoof fingerprint that has characteristics similar to those of a real
fingerprint, we printed a latent fingerprint pattern by using an inkjet
printer with conductive CNT ink. With the printing setup, we could
print spoof fingerprint patterns that not only mimicked the shapes
of fingerprint patterns but were also electrically conductive. Before
the printing, we optimized the latent fingerprint, as mentioned in
the image processing section. We printed the latent fingerprint various
numbers of times to select the best printing condition for generating
a printed fingerprint identical to the latent fingerprint. Figure 6a shows that the
total area of the printed fingerprint was larger than the total area
of the processed image by approximately 18 mm2 for one
printing. Moreover, the total area of the printed fingerprint was
smaller than that of the original latent fingerprint by roughly 18
mm2. The spoof fingerprint fabricated using two printings
had a total area larger than that of the original latent fingerprint
by approximately 18 mm2. Thus, one and two printings provided
total areas similar to that of the original latent fingerprint. The
data also showed that the total area of printed fingerprint pattern
dramatically increased with increasing number of printings.

Figure 6 Characterization
of the printed fingerprint: (a) total area of
the printed fingerprint pattern vs the number of printings, (b) widths
of a ridge and a furrow of the printed fingerprint pattern vs the
number of printings, and (c) surface profiles of the ridges and the
furrows of the printed fingerprint for various numbers of printings.

To observe the changes in the
widths of the ridges and the furrows
of the printed fingerprint, we selected three ridges and furrows and
then measured the changes in their widths. We found that the width
of the ridge printed 10 times was about 40 μm larger than the
width of the ridge printed one time, whereas the furrow width of the
printed fingerprint decreased with increasing number of printings
(Figure 6b). One and
two printings provided patterns similar to those of the latent fingerprint.
We measured the surface profiles of the printed fingerprints across
six ridges and five furrows (Figure 6c). The physical structure (height) of the printed
fingerprint increased with increasing number of printings, which made
the printed ridges more distinguishable.

Spoofing Attack on a Fingerprint
Capacitive Sensor
A fingerprint can be used as an identification
key via a fingerprint
sensor embedded in the unlock button and in the recognition system
of a smartphone. According to Galbally et al., who compared the detected
fingerprint with the stored one, identification was verified and access
was authorized if at least a dozen characteristics and minutiae among
the extracted features of the fingerprint used for entry matched those
of the fingerprint in storage.45

The capacitive sensor works by detecting changes in capacitance across
its electronic circuits under the influence of a conductor on its
surfaces. The capacitance of a parallel plate capacitance, C, is 1  where κ, ε0, and A and d are the dielectric constant, the
permittivity of free space, and the area of and the distance between
the plates, respectively. The top plate of the capacitive sensor was
replaced by a patterned CNT electrode printed on paper, thus forming
an electrically equivalent sensing capacitor, Cs (the capacitor in Figure 7, colored in orange),46,47 and ground
capacitor, Cb (the capacitor in Figure 7, colored in green).
Because the CNT plate was charged with free electrons at the moment
of touching, at least the sensor’s capacitance was clearly
detected, along with a specific relatively small additive perturbation
that was caused by the long, conductive-CNT-ridge electrode acting
as a grounding plate. As a result, our ungrounded fake fingerprint
was detectable (Figure 7).

Figure 7 Spoofing attack to unlock a smartphone by using a printed paper-based
fingerprint and mechanism through which a printed paper-based fingerprint
sends the electronic signals necessary to unlock the fingerprint sensor.

Once the latent fingerprints had
been printed from 1 to 10 times,
individually printed fingerprints were cut out by using scissors.
We used each printed fingerprint for a spoofing attack on the unlock
button of a smartphone, Samsung Galaxy A5, which had been preprogrammed
with the owner’s real fingerprint. It should be noted that
many trials were needed to exert the pressure of the printed pattern
on the unlock button, which must be similar to that usually exerted
by the owner. After the spoofing attack on the phone, we found that
the fingerprints printed one, two, three, and five times had been
successful in unlocking the phone (Figure 7, Video Clip S2), whereas the fingerprints printed more than five times failed to
unlock the phone. This is because the fingerprints printed one, two,
three, and five times generated ridges that were identical in width
to the original latent fingerprint, while the others had much larger
widths. We also discovered that the spoofing attack typically invoked
two types of responses: the phone was unlocked instantaneously on
the first try or in less than 10 trials in about a minute for the
case of using the spoof fingerprints printed two and three times,
and the phone was unlocked after many attempts, which took as long
as 20 min for the case of using the spoof fingerprint printed one
and five times. We believe that the cause of difference in responses
was not only contributed from the exactness in width to the original
latent fingerprint but also caused by the thickness of the printed
patterns.

Conclusions
We made a fingerprint
by using an inkjet printer to print CNT ink
on paper and successfully applied that fingerprint for a spoofing
attack to unlock the start button of a smartphone. Because of the
unique features of the CNT ink over other conducting metal-based inks,
this method had the advantage of being easily accessible, without
the need for a posttreatment. We demonstrated that by mimicking real
ridges that were CNT-printed electrodes, a conductive CNT ink could
be used to unlock a currently available smartphone. We emphasize that
current security systems, without reinforced protection, may not be
able to prevent a spoofing attack using a printed spoof fingerprint
from being successful. If spoofing attacks on biometric devices are
to be avoided, users must be careful not to leave latent fingerprints
on any devices, digital images, or places.

Experimental Details
In this experiment, an aqueous printable ink made of multiwalled
CNTs was used with a nonpolar organic dispersant, as described in
our previous report.24 After being mixed
and dispersed, CNTs were filtered with a 1 μm pore filter (GF/B,
Whatman) to be used with an inkjet printer (Figure 2a). The ink’s surface tension and
viscosity were measured by using a surface tension analyzer (SmartDrop,
Femtobiomed) and a rheometer (Brookfield, RVDV-III Ultra), respectively.
An ink cartridge (DMC-11610, Fujifilm, USA) was filled with the CNT
ink, and an inkjet printer (Dimatix, DMP-2831, Fujifilm, USA) was
used for the printing. A scanner (XP-225, Epson) was used to scan
the fingerprint, which had been captured by pressing the real fingerprint
covered with black stamp ink (Mae-Pyo) on photo paper (HB4020). We
used the inkjet printer with the CNT ink to create a spoof fingerprint
on the same photo paper (HB4020). The surface roughness (Ra) and surface contact angle of the photo paper were approximately
10 nm and 40°, respectively. The image processing and analyzing
were carried out by using a freeware program (ImageJ).

The surface
properties of the printed patterns were analyzed using
a surface profiler (Dektak-XT, Bruker). A USB microscope (U500X, Cooling
Tech) and a scanning electron microscope (JSM-6710F, JEOL) were employed
for image analysis. A four-point measurement of the surface resistance
was carried out by using Lucas Pro4 with a Keithley 2400 source meter
(Keithley Instruments).
