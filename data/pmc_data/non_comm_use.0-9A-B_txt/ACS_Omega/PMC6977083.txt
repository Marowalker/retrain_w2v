Sodium dodecyl sulfate
(SDS)·1/8 hydrate (NaC12H25SO4·1/8H2O) crystals were
successfully produced by evaporation, antisolvent addition, cooling
crystallization, and isothermal aging in a common stirred tank. A
clear 33.3 wt % SDS aqueous solution was concentrated by evaporation
to a 60 wt % coagel consisting of numerous SDS hydrates and water.
The coagel was transformed to a clear solution when two times the
volume of acetone relative to the water remaining were added. By this
fluid property, a controlled crystallization was made possible in
a homogeneous solution. Moreover, acetone with a water-to-acetone
volume ratio of 1:15 was then added as an antisolvent to induce crystallization
of SDS·1/8 hydrate by cubic addition. Finally, cooling crystallization
and isothermal aging were carried out to further increase the yields
and gave monodispersed particle size. The stability test showed that
the produced SDS·1/8 hydrate could be stored at various relative
humidity environments for at least 5 days.

INTRODUCTION
To better engineer
the crystal attributes for manufacturability
in downstream processes, solution crystallization can be induced by
supersaturation through three well-known approaches: evaporation,
antisolvent addition, and cooling. Evaporation is one of the convenient
ways to concentrate the solution. As the concentration of the solution
keeps increasing, the supersaturation will induce crystallization
of the solute. Consequently, evaporative crystallization is often
combined with other separation processes to reduce equipment requirement.1 Despite the operational advantages of evaporative
crystallization, there is a caveat. By employing evaporative crystallization,
crystal attributes, including polymorphism, crystallinity, and particle
size distribution (PSD), are hard to achieve reproducibly upon scaling
up.2,3 The crystallization process is also easily influenced
by the uncontrollably grown crystals acting as seeds having inconsistent
PSD due to the descent of the mother liquid level. Antisolvent crystallization
can be operated at the isothermal condition, which is of paramount
importance for heat-sensitive substances aside from convenience and
economical aspects. The desired PSD may be achieved by controlling
the addition position and rate of the antisolvent.4,5 However,
the binary solvent mixture must be subsequently separated to recover
and recycle one or both solvents, and the capacity of the vessel is
taken up by the additional volume of the antisolvent. On the other
hand, cooling crystallization is a popular technique for the production
of high-value chemicals.6 Temperature control
is a critical factor for determining the crystallization rate by cooling
crystallization. A low crystallization rate can be achieved by a slow
cooling rate, which gives a relatively large metastable zone width
(MSZW) beyond the solubility. Accordingly, a high degree of supersaturation
is required to induce crystallization. Slow cooling could increase
the product purity because of fewer lattice defects and reduced crystal
agglomeration.

Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) is the most common
sulfate surfactant
and a key component of many domestic cleaning, personal hygiene, cosmetic,
pharmaceutical, and food products, as well as of industrial and commercial
cleaning and product formulations. SDS is prepared by first reacting
dodecyl alcohol (dodecanol) with concentrated sulfuric acid (or with
sulfur trioxide gas, oleum, or chlorosulfuric acid)7 and then neutralizing dodecyl sulfate with sodium hydroxide
aqueous solution. Since water is generated as a byproduct8 and SDS is highly soluble in water,9 the result is an SDS aqueous solution. Based
on our previous experiences, foaming could occur at boiling upon evaporation
in a stirred tank, and phases such as micelles, liquid crystals, and
coagels would form as the concentration of SDS aqueous solution increases
at a given temperature, complicating the nucleation step control.
Moreover, SDS has several hydrates other than the anhydrous form,10 such as 1/8 hydrate,11 hemihydrate,12 monohydrate,13 and dihydrate.14 An
additional form, called the “α phase”, nearly
identical to 1/8 hydrate, has also been reported.15,16 The α phase, produced by slow evaporation of SDS from a 95%
ethanol aqueous solution, has a monoclinic Cc or C2/c structure.17 However, the single-crystal structure of the
dihydrate SDS solid has not been established, and various kinds of
SDS hydrates have only been prepared and analyzed in a small scale
by growing the solids in chloroform-methanol cosolvents,11 water through cooling,18,19 or ethanolic aqueous solution by slow evaporation from a saturated
solution at a constant temperature.15 These
methods can only be utilized for crystallography and are inappropriate
for mass production.

Interestingly, the formation of hydrates
is affected by the solvent
composition, temperature, pressure, and relative humidity (RH) range.20,21 Hydrates can be described in terms of their stoichiometry relative
to the host molecule, and they are often classified as stoichiometric
or nonstoichiometric. Stoichiometric hydrates have a well-defined
water content, and the crystal structure is clearly different from
that of other solid forms.22 In comparison
to the stoichiometric hydrate, nonstoichiometric hydrates can vary
in water content without distinguishable changes in the crystal structure
because of the existence of the so-called channel (open structural
voids).23 Upon dehydration, water in the
channel can be removed without substantially affecting the crystalline
structure. The void spaces due to dehydration can also be filled reversibly
while still retaining the initial crystalline structure. Various hydrate
solid forms possess different properties of thermodynamics, kinetics,
and surfaces,24 which are especially important
for active pharmaceutical ingredients. In general, knowledge of the
water content of hydration is necessary for determining the equivalent
weight and dosage amount in formulation.

Commercially, SDS solids
are produced by spray-drying.25 Water in
the sprayed droplets of the SDS aqueous
solution is rapidly evaporated off with a hot gas, and fine powders
are made instantly. However, the hydrate solid forms in the fine powders
are not well controlled, and the resultant fine powders need to be
enlarged for ease of handling into cylindrical granules by an additional
step of extrusion.26 Although it was shown
that cooling crystallization of the 20 wt % SDS–water micellar
solution could give a much larger particle size, this single-solvent
process by linear cooling was not robust enough because the production
of either SDS monohydrate platelets or SDS hemihydrate needles was
sensitive to the cooling ramp and the final temperature.19 Interestingly, commercial SDS solids are sold
as a mixture of hydrate forms rather than a specific hydrate. The
large-scale production of specific SDS hydrate solids has never been
reported in the literature. The complicated evaporation process during
spray-drying may easily make the quality of its crystallization product
go out of control. The instability of the hydrate forms also makes
long-time storage difficult. Nevertheless, a mixture of crystal forms
was unfavorable at all times for manufacturing or practical applications
due to its inconsistent physical and chemical properties. Stability,
molecular weight, dissolution rate, hardness, toughness, and morphology
of SDS particles would be greatly affected as the hydrate structure
varies. High purity should be pursued not only in chemical structures
but also in the crystal form.

Although crystallization and phase
transformation among different
SDS hydrates at various temperatures have been studied,17−19,27,28 the systems were constrained in an aqueous solution and the drying
behaviors of the hydrate crystals have not been investigated. The
SDS·1/8 hydrate was believed to be stable in air.28 Therefore, the aim of this paper is to develop
a robust crystallization protocol in a common stirred tank for readily
making large particles of a stable SDS·1/8 hydrate solid form
from an SDS aqueous solution reproducibly. The crystallization of
the SDS·1/8 hydrate would be broken down into four steps: evaporation,
antisolvent addition, cooling, and isothermal aging. Notably, the
crystallization know-how learned from SDS may also be applied to some
other highly water-soluble zwitterionic sulfonic acid biological buffering
agents, which are also synthesized in aqueous media.29

Results and Discussion
Construction of Form Space
Solvents
play an important
role in controlling yield, purity, solubility, polymorphism, and crystal
habit and in selecting the appropriate crystallization process. Choosing
a suitable solvent for dissolution and crystallization is essential.
Form space30 is a useful table to indicate
rapidly whether a solvent is good or bad in terms of its solubility
power and show clearly the mutual relationship between any two solvents.
A solvent is classified as a pure good solvent when the solubility
value of SDS in that solvent at 25 °C is higher than or equal
to 5 mg/mL; otherwise, it was considered a pure bad solvent in our
present study. Actually, the criterion of 5 mg/mL can be changed to
1 mg/mL or less, 10 mg/mL or more, at 25 °C depending on the
volume of the crystallizer, the process, and the nature of the final
product. According to the results summarized in the form space (Table 1), SDS had five pure
good solvents: N,N-dimethylformamide
(DMF), ethanol, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), methanol, and water, as
represented by the yellow grids, and 18 pure bad solvents: n-heptane, xylene, p-xylene, ethyl acetate,
toluene, methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), benzene,
methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), chloroform, tetrahydrofuran (THF), N,N-dimethylaniline (DMA), acetone, 1,4-dioxane,
nitrobenzene, n-butyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol
(IPA), benzyl alcohol, and acetonitrile, as marked by the red grids.
A good solvent is commonly used as a medium for solution crystallization.
Its high solubility power can provide a sensible ratio between the
solvent and solute for efficient utilization of volume capacity of
a crystallizer to give a relatively high yield of product. It should
be noted that it is insufficient to select the solvent candidate for
crystallization merely by the form space. Other factors, such as the
slope of the solubility vs. temperature curve, chemical reactivity,
toxicity, and cost, would have to be taken into account. By integrating
the information above, a solvent database is constructed for selecting
a suitable solvent and designing a crystallization process. For example,
the good solvent that displays a high-temperature-dependent solubility
behavior to the desired product can be employed for cooling crystallization
due to the high theoretical yield.21

Table 1 Form Space of SDS at 25 °C and
1 atm
The form space in Table 1 is diagonally symmetrical.
There are 10 good cosolvent pairs
represented by the blue grids, 72 antisolvent pairs designated by
the green grids, and 20 immiscible pairs indicated by the gray grids.
The bad solvent miscible with the good solvent can play the role of
either an antisolvent for crystallization or a rinsing solvent for
filter cake washing. An antisolvent is usually used for (1) inducing
crystallization under isothermal condition, (2) combining with cooling
or evaporative crystallization to further enhance the yields, and
(3) modifying the solubility of the solute by other reasons.31 In general, a pure bad solvent, a bad cosolvent
system, and an immiscible solvent system are rarely considered for
crystallization. As a result, the criterion can be set to less than
5 mg/mL at 25 °C if the good solvents are so few in number that
it is difficult to find a suitable solvent medium.

Since water
is the reaction medium, a byproduct for SDS synthesis
in the final step, and environmentally benign, it is chosen as the
good solvent employed out of the five good solvents from Table 1 in the preparation
of the SDS·1/8 hydrate to simulate the real situation after reaction,
whereas acetone was chosen as the antisolvent out of the 18 bad solvents
from Table 1 because
of its low cost, slight toxicity, and water miscibility.32

Determination of the End Point for Evaporation
Since
SDS was highly water-soluble, it was difficult to get a high yield
by using the single solution crystallization method. The phase diagram
of the SDS–water binary system also exhibited that the SDS·1/8
hydrate was generated in a narrow region having a very low water content.14 Evaporation was used first to enhance the concentration
of the SDS solution for preparing the SDS·1/8 hydrate. However,
the high viscosity caused by the high concentration of SDS led to
poor mixing. To overcome the unwanted solution thickening, an antisolvent
was introduced after evaporation. As a result, the end point of evaporation
had to be determined beforehand. At first, evaporation was applied
to concentrate the clear, free-flowing 33.3 wt % SDS aqueous solution,
which was close to saturation.14 The photo
images taken after evaporation for SDS–water systems having
final compositions of 55, 60, 65, and 70 wt % with different addition
volumes of acetone based on acetone-to-water volume ratios of 0:1,
2:1, 3:1, and 5:1 relative to the volumes of water remaining in the
vials of 2.45, 2.00, 1.62, and 1.29 mL, respectively, at 25 °C
are summarized in Table 2. It is clearly seen that the coagel was formed on the SDS aqueous
solution surface for all SDS–water systems at 55, 60, 65, and
70 wt %. The opaque and inhomogeneous coagel phase comprised water
and SDS hydrates.14,33 The micellar solution phase,
liquid crystalline phase, coagel, and hydrate were illustrated in
the phase diagram by Kékicheff et al.14 Given the concentration of SDS between 37 and 87 wt % at 25 °C,
the coagel phase will develop in water, which agrees with our experimental
observation. It is well known that good mixing is critical for the
crystallization process. Uniform crystal quality and narrow PSD could
then be achieved in the common stirred tank during scale-up upon efficient
momentum, heat, and mass transfer. Any presence of the tacky coagel
could hinder the free flow of the SDS solution and make the mixing
very difficult.

Table 2 Phase behaviors of the SDS aqueous
solution at the end of evaporation and after acetone addition
Interestingly, the already-formed coagel
phase dissolved and turned
into a clear, free-flowing SDS solution when two times the volumes
of acetone 4.9 and 4.0 mL relative to the water remaining in the vials
of 2.45 and 2 mL were added into the SDS coagel in vial nos. 1 and
4, respectively. The clear, free-flowing SDS solution became turbid
when the volume ratios of water to acetone were adjusted to 1:3 and
1:5 in vial nos. 2–3 and 5–6, respectively (Table 2). When the SDS aqueous
solutions were concentrated to 65 or 70 wt %, the coagel phases did
not disappear even when two times the volume of acetone of 3.24 and
2.58 mL relative to the water remaining in the vials of 1.62 and 1.29
mL were added in vial nos. 7 and 10, respectively. Vial nos. 8–9
and 11–12 illustrated that more and more solids precipitated
out as the volume of acetone was increased. Therefore, a 60 wt % SDS–water
system was selected to be the end point for the evaporation step,
and two times the volume of acetone relative to the residual volume
of water would need to be added to achieve a homogeneous phase for
carrying out the controllable crystallization process.

Determination
of the Final Composition of the Water–Acetone
Cosolvent for Preparing the SDS·1/8 Hydrate
Although
the hydrate form and micelle structure were investigated a lot in
the literature, most of the cases were constrained in the SDS–water
binary system. The crystallization and phase transition of the SDS
hydrate in the SDS–water–acetone ternary system had
never been reported. The composition of the antisolvent was also a
significant factor for crystallization; therefore, the final volume
ratio of water to acetone for the production of SDS·1/8 hydrate
solids at 5 °C was determined in our present study. Figure 1 displays the powder
X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns for the commercial SDS cylindrical
granules and the commercial SDS cylindrical granules aged in water–acetone
cosolvents with water-to-acetone volume ratios of 1:10, 1:17, and
1:25. The PXRD patterns of the commercial SDS powders and the aged
SDS cylindrical granules looked nearly the same. However, the thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) scans of the commercial SDS cylindrical granules and
the aged SDS powders in Figure 2 showed otherwise. All SDS samples exhibited two steps in
weight loss regardless of the composition of the aging solvent used.
The slight weight loss before 120 °C resulted from dehydration
(inset in Figure 2),
and the significant weight loss from 200 to 325 °C can be attributed
to the decomposition of the SDS molecule. The weight loss from dehydration
for each sample is listed in Table 3. The commercial SDS cylindrical granules had a weight
loss of 1.64 wt %, and all aged SDS commercial cylinder granules had
a weight loss of 0.74–0.75 wt % before 120 °C.

The three SDS hydrate forms of 1/8 hydrate, hemihydrate,
and monohydrate
gave the theoretical weight fractions of water of 0.77, 2.95, and
5.58 wt %, respectively. According to the definition of hydrate, the
host molecule and the water molecule have a definite stoichiometry
within the crystal lattice. The weight loss arising from dehydration
of a pure SDS hydrate should correspond to the weight percent of water
originally present in the SDS hydrate. A weight loss of 0.77% was
predicted for the SDS·1/8 hydrate crystal during dehydration.
Obviously, all of the aged SDS powders were SDS·1/8 hydrates
because of the weight loss of close to 0.77% as determined by TGA,
whereas the commercial SDS was a mixture of hydrates composed primarily
of SDS·1/8 hydrate and a small amount of hemihydrate and/or monohydrate. Figure 3 shows that the differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) scans of the commercial SDS cylindrical
granules and the aged SDS powders exhibited more or less the same
dehydration endotherm around 103 °C and melting point around
196 °C, indicating that all dehydrated samples have the same
crystal structure.

commercial
SDS cylindrical granules aged in a cosolvent with volume ratios of
water to acetone of (b) 1:10, (c) 1:17, and (d) 1:25 at 5 °C
for 8 h.

In summary, the SDS·1/8 hydrate
could be produced by aging
the commercial SDS cylinder granules in the water–acetone cosolvents
with the water-to-acetone volume ratios ranging from 1:10 to 1:25.
XRD and TGA could discriminate a specific hydrate form from the others
or their mixtures. From the standpoint of optimizing the product yield
from solution crystallization, seemingly, the more antisolvent added,
the better. The water-to-acetone volume ratio of 1:25 would have been
the best choice. However, the large volume of antisolvent added would
take up the crystallizer volume, which could have been fed by more
SDS aqueous solution. Consequently, we decided to operate at the water-to-acetone
volume ratio of 1:17, which was between 1:10 and 1:25; this would
also give an operation cushion for unexpected volume fluctuation during
scale-up.

Crystallization Process of the SDS·1/8 Hydrate
Figure 4 illustrates
the temperature versus time profile for the crystallization process
of SDS·1/8 hydrate crystals. First, the 33.3 wt % SDS saturated
solution was heated from 25 to 70 °C and evaporated at a constant
temperature of 70 °C. Considering the low boiling point of acetone,
acetone was added as the temperature was decreased to 25 °C.
The cooling ramp was about 1 °C/min, which was controlled by
the water bath. The large amount of acetone would give a high degree
of supersaturation for SDS and induce crystallization. Then, the resulting
SDS suspension was further cooled to 5 °C with a cooling ramp
of 0.66 °C/min and further aged isothermally for 8 h. The composition
of SDS in wt % in the glass stirred tank was deduced by weighing the
evaporated water condensed and collected in the round-bottomed receiver
every 30 min during evaporation, and the temperature profile was monitored
for the whole 13 h-long crystallization process.

Figure 4 Temperature, volume of
water, and volume of acetone vs. time profile
of the crystallization process of the SDS·1/8 hydrate.

To speed up the evaporation process, the 33.3 wt
% SDS aqueous
solution was heated to 70 °C under agitation of 200 rpm at 260
torr. Because the saturated vapor pressure of water at 70 °C
is 235 torr, to avoid solution boiling and minimize foaming, the operating
pressure of 260 torr was set above 235 torr. Intensive foaming was
troublesome since the SDS soap bubbles could move up the stirred tank
and go down to the receiver. The same problem would occur if the agitation
rate was too high and a lot of air was blown through the solution.
The 33.3 wt % SDS aqueous solution was quite viscous in the beginning,
and then slight foaming occurred at 36 wt % in 0.5 h due to the decrease
in water surface tension. As the concentration went up to 44 wt %,
the SDS–water system became more and more tacky, and finally
the coagel was formed. By the end of 3 h, the 60 wt % SDS–water
system was cooled to 25 °C, and the pressure was recovered to
760 torr. The temperature fluctuation between 0 and 3 h in Figure 4 was caused by water
evaporation. Evaporation is an endothermic process, and the temperature
of the SDS solution was reduced when water was vaporized. However,
the vacuum was temporarily broken from time to time for weighing the
water inside the receiver while the hot water jacket still supplied
heat to the SDS solution; the temperature of the SDS solution was
then increased. As a consequence, the periodic vacuum shutdown had
led to the noisy temperature profile during evaporation.

The
volume of acetone was determined as 289 mL, which was 17 times
the volume of residual water from the previous evaporation experiment.
However, if the total volume of acetone was poured in all at once,
the already-formed SDS coagel and the newly generated crystals from
antisolvent crystallization would coexist. This would make the crystallization
process go out of control, resulting in the inconsistency of yield,
purity, crystal habit, and PSD of the final SDS hydrate product. The
uncontrollable crystallization process was disadvantageous in batch-to-batch
reproducibility and scale-up performance. It should be noticed that
the particular proportion of acetone to water was found in the end-point
determination experiment for the evaporation process (Table 2). The tacky SDS coagel disappeared
and became clear upon the introduction of acetone, whose volume was
two times the volume of the remaining water. It was much better to
divide the addition of acetone into two portions. After adding the
first portion of 34 mL of acetone, which was twofold that of 17 mL
of the remaining water, at 25 °C, the coagel lumps dissolved
and turned into a clear, free-flowing tertiary SDS–water–acetone
solution. The drawback brought about by evaporative crystallization
could be overcome by this redissolution. The second portion of 255
mL of acetone was then fed by cubic addition at 25 °C. The addition
strategy of the antisolvent is an important factor in antisolvent
crystallization. Linear addition of the antisolvent is commonly used
in antisolvent crystallization. It causes a high level of supersaturation
initially but decreases gradually with time. In other words, the level
of supersaturation varied with time. The other strategy was nonlinear
addition; the addition rate of the antisolvent was increased with
time to offer a roughly constant change of the supersaturation level.34 This method could minimize the nucleation rate,
so that the promoted concentration was controlled within the metastable
zone, leading to a growth-dominant process. Cubic addition is one
of the examples of nonlinear addition and has been utilized in our
present process. Finally, the SDS slurry at 25 °C was cooled
to 5 °C to produce more crystals and aged in the cosolvent comprising
17 mL of water and 289 mL of acetone with the water-to-acetone volume
ratio of 1:17 at 5 °C for 8 h. The SDS·1/8 hydrate crystals
became larger, and the PSD was narrowed by Ostwald ripening.

The crystal habit and stoichiometry of the produced SDS crystals
were monitored by optical microscopy (OM) and TGA after the introduction
of acetone by the cubic addition method, respectively, as demonstrated
in Table 4. The SDS
crystals started to nucleate and grow immediately once acetone was
fed. Thin and flaky plates of produced SDS crystals18 grew gradually with time from 50 μm after the addition
of the first vial of 25.5 mL of acetone at t = 0
min to about 100–150 μm at the end upon the addition
of the tenth vial of 25.5 mL of acetone at t = 27.
0 min. Remarkably, the weight loss of the produced SDS crystals harvested
at t = 0 min had already reached 0.77 wt %, which
matched well with the theoretical amount of water in the SDS·1/8
hydrate. The same TGA weight loss of 0.77 wt % was maintained for
the produced SDS crystals collected after the addition of the tenth
vial of 25.5 mL of acetone at t = 27.0 min. These
results prove that antisolvent crystallization could produce SDS·1/8
hydrate crystals that are stable in the water–acetone cosolvent
system. The produced SDS·1/8 hydrate crystals more or less stayed
at 150 μm and became monodispersed after aging for 4 and 8 h
at 5 °C (Table 4). The final yield of the SDS·1/8 hydrate crystals was about
83%. Apparently, the SDS crystal had a tendency to become SDS·1/8
hydrate in a water–acetone cosolvent system at both 5 and 25
°C. Changing the temperature for acetone addition from 25 to
5 °C might be feasible. However, the substantial temperature
drop would lead to a large solubility difference and a high level
of supersaturation. The number of nuclei explodes suddenly, which
was disadvantageous for PSD control. In addition, the poor mixing
resulting from the coagel phase should be overcome first, or else,
the heat exchange in the crystallizer would be hindered. For these
given reasons, cooling was done after antisolvent addition even though
it was possible to harvest the SDS·1/8 hydrate if those two steps
were reversed. The second cooling step from 25 to 5 °C not only
enhanced the yield of SDS·1/8 hydrate crystals but also facilitated
the growth of SDS·1/8 hydrate crystals.

The assignments of Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy
bands for SDS·1/8 hydrate crystals made from the crystallization
process are shown and compared in Figure 5: the 3470 cm–1 band was
assigned to −OH stretching; the 2957, 2873, 2848, and 1468
cm–1 peaks corresponded to −CH2 stretching and bending modes, which were characteristic of a polar
environment; the 1213 cm–1 peak was assigned to
skeletal vibration involving the bridge S–O stretch; the 1083
cm–1 peak was attributed to C–C band stretching;
and the 837 and 592 cm-1 peaks were attributed to
asymmetric C–H bending of the CH2 group.35 The PXRD pattern of our produced SDS·1/8
hydrate crystals and the theoretical PXRD patterns of the SDS anhydrous
form, the SDS·1/8 hydrate, the SDS hemihydrate, and the SDS monohydrate
are shown in Figure 6. The PXRD pattern of the produced SDS·1/8 hydrate crystals
matched very well with the theoretical one of the SDS·1/8 hydrate.
The GC chromatograms in Figure S1 of the
Supporting Information (SI) indicated that no acetone remained in
our produced SDS·1/8 hydrate crystals.

Moisture Stability Test
The hydrate
forms could transform
mutually with the change of RH, temperature, and pressure.36 It was difficult to evaluate the stability among
the various SDS hydrate forms under solvent-free and ambient conditions
because the dry powders were not obtainable. Nevertheless, our produced
SDS·1/8 hydrate could be stable upon oven-drying at 40 °C
in air. To further determine the influence of humidity on the SDS·1/8
hydrate, the moisture stability test for our produced SDS·1/8
hydrate crystals was performed in the present study. Our produced
SDS·1/8 hydrate crystals were stored in three different humidity
conditions of 25, 52, and 75% RH at 25 °C for 5 days. The TGA
scans in Figure 7 demonstrate
that SDS·1/8 hydrate crystals subjected to three different %RH
values exhibited the same weight loss of around 0.75 wt %. The PXRD
patterns in Figure 8 also indicated that all of our produced SDS·1/8 hydrate samples
exposed to the three different %RH values looked identical to the
PXRD pattern of the original SDS·1/8 hydrate crystals. The wide
range of %RH illustrated that the water content of the SDS·1/8
hydrate was not altered by moisture. It was reasonable to deduce that
the SDS·1/8 hydrate was more stable than the other hydrate forms
at various %RH, 25 °C, and 1 atm.

75% RH at 25 °C for 5 days.

Moreover, the SDS powders were dehydrated to evaluate the stability
of anhydrous SDS. The commercial SDS sample was first dehydrated by
heating in TGA from 40 to 150 °C and then holding isothermally
for 5 min under a nitrogen purge. The weight loss of the samples was
followed. The TGA dehydrated samples were then characterized immediately
by PXRD after the temperature was returned to room temperature to
minimize the contact time with air. In Figure 9a,b, the first and second scans of the commercial
SDS sample showed weight losses of 1.45 and 0.76 wt %, respectively,
indicating that the commercial SDS sample was a mixture of hydrates
initially. The SDS sample was then recovered to the mixture of hydrates
even though it had been dehydrated previously. Right after the first
dehydration for the TGA dehydrated commercial SDS sample (Figure 10a), the diffraction
pattern exhibited diffraction peaks of SDS hemihydrate with characteristic
2θ = 5.6 and 8.5° (Figure 10d). The dehydrated SDS crystals, presumably the anhydrous
form, were instable upon air contact and showed the tendency of rehydration
again. It implied that the SDS·1/8 hydrate was more stable than
anhydrous SDS at 25 °C in air. Therefore, the production of SDS·1/8
hydrate was favorable not only for the reproducibility of SDS structural
purity and equivalent weight determination but also for the storage
quality of SDS.

Conclusions
To date, SDS has commonly
been applied in the areas of detergents,
excipients, cosmetics,37 and gas hydration.38 The water present in the crystal lattice of
the host molecule was critical for influencing the physical and chemical
properties of the solid state such as morphology, hardness, dissolution
rate, and toughness, leading to inconsistent quality of the final
products. Therefore, it is paramount to make the pure stable hydrate
in a large scale reproducibly. In the present study, the form space
of SDS has been constructed, which can be utilized as an important
reference for determining the solvents used in synthesis, crystallization,
and separation processes. SDS·1/8 hydrate crystals were successfully
produced by evaporation, antisolvent addition, and cooling in a common
stirred tank. A clear, free-flowing 33.3 wt % SDS aqueous solution
was concentrated by evaporation to a 60 wt % SDS–water binary
system containing the tacky coagel, which was determined as the end
point. Acetone that was two times the volume relative to the water
remaining was added to dissolve the coagel. The newly formed tertiary
SDS–water–acetone system had turned clear again. By
this property, a controlled crystallization was made in a homogeneous
solution. Acetone was then added to the system at 25 °C until
the water-to-acetone volume ratio in the stirred tank had reached
1:17 as an antisolvent to induce crystallization by cubic addition.
The cubic addition strategy of acetone and isothermal aging can not
only enlarge the crystal size of SDS but also give a narrow PSD. The
produced platelike SDS·1/8 hydrate crystals were verified by
TGA and PXRD and had a size of 150 μm as characterized by OM.
In summary, a robust and reproducible protocol has been developed
by combining evaporation, antisolvent addition, and cooling crystallization
in a common stirred tank for readily controlling the particle size
and the hydration stoichiometry of a stable form of SDS hydrates grown
from an SDS aqueous solution. The moisture stability test showed that
commercial SDS cylindrical granules became a mixture of SDS hydrates
rapidly again after dehydration. Moreover, the produced SDS·1/8
hydrate could be stored at a relatively high %RH environment at 25
°C for at least 5 days.

Construction
of Form Space
Form space consisted of
six parts: pure good solvents, pure bad solvents, good cosolvents,
bad cosolvents, antisolvent (i.e., good-solvent–bad-solvent
pairs), and immiscible pairs. Twenty-three common solvents, n-heptane, xylene, p-xylene, ethyl acetate,
toluene, MTBE, benzene, MEK, chloroform, THF, DMA, acetone, 1,4-dioxane,
nitrobenzene, n-butyl alcohol, IPA, benzyl alcohol,
acetonitrile, DMF, ethanol, DMSO, methanol, and water, were used for
the construction of form space of SDS at 25 °C and 1 atm. The
solvents were classified as pure good solvents, pure bad solvents,
good cosolvents, bad cosolvents, antisolvents, and immiscible pairs
in accordance with their solubility to SDS. These six parts would
be displayed as grids by different colors and formed a 23 × 23
table. Solvents that gave the solubility value of SDS larger than
5 mg per mL were defined as pure good solvents, or else as pure bad
solvents. The pure solvent system was represented as diagonal grids
in the form space. The binary solvent systems mixed by two good solvents,
two bad solvents, and one good and one bad solvent were classified
as good cosolvents, bad cosolvents, and Antisolvent-good-solvent system,
respectively. The immiscible solvent pair indicated that the solvent
mixture was immiscible, for example, water and n-heptane.

The procedure for constructing the form space was followed.30 About 10–30 mg of SDS powder sample was
weighed in 7 mL scintillation vials, and the 23 solvents were added
dropwise into the vials individually with intermittent shaking at
25 °C until SDS solids were totally dissolved as observed manually.

Determination of the End Point for Evaporation
This
process aimed to simulate and determine the end point for the concentration
step of SDS aqueous solution by evaporation. Twelve 100 mL scintillation
vials, with each containing 33.3 wt % SDS aqueous solution by dissolving
3 g of commercial SDS cylindrical granules in 6 mL of water at 25
°C, were prepared. All 12 clear 33.3 wt % SDS aqueous solutions
were then evaporated under 760 torr at a constant temperature of 70
°C by a water bath until the final compositions of the SDS aqueous
solutions of vial nos. 1–3, 4–6, 7–9, and 10–12
had become 55, 60, 65, and 70 wt % SDS–water systems, respectively,
which were equal to the water volumes remaining of 2.45, 2.00, 1.62,
and 1.29 mL, respectively. All 12 vials were then cooled to 25 °C.
Two times the volume of acetone of 4.90, 4.00, 3.24, and 2.58 mL relative
to the water volume remaining were introduced into vial nos. 1, 4,
7, and 10 of 55, 60, 65, and 70 wt % SDS–water systems with
agitation at 25 °C, respectively. Three times the volume of acetone
of 7.35, 6.00, 4.86, and 3.87 mL relative to the water volume remaining
were added into vial nos. 2, 5, 8, and 11 of 55, 60, 65, and 70 wt
% SDS–water systems with agitation at 25 °C, respectively.
Five times the volume of acetone of 12.25, 10.00, 8.10, and 6.45 mL
relative to the water volume remaining were added into vial nos. 3,
6, 9, and 12 of 55, 60, 65, and 70 wt % SDS–water systems with
agitation at 25 °C, respectively. If a given wt % of the SDS
aqueous solution could form a slurry or coagel upon evaporation and
be turned into a free-flowing clear solution by acetone addition at
the same time, that particular wt % of the SDS aqueous solution and
the acetone volume were determined as the end-point conditions for
evaporation. The compositions of vial nos. 1–12 and the flowchart
are shown in Table S1 and Figure S2 in the SI, respectively.

Determination of the Final
Composition of the Water–Acetone
Cosolvent for Preparing the SDS·1/8 Hydrate by Aging
First, 0.5 g of commercial SDS cylindrical granules was immersed
into a water–acetone cosolvent with different water-to-acetone
volume ratios at 25 °C for 8 h. The volume ratios of water to
acetone are listed in Table S2 of the SI.
After 8 h of aging, the immersed SDS solids were filtered, oven-dried
at 40 °C for 8 h, and characterized by PXRD, TGA, and DSC to
determine the water-to-acetone ratio, which gave the SDS·1/8
hydrate.

Crystallization Process of the SDS·1/8 Hydrate
Considering the unpredictability in engineering the crystal quality
by evaporative crystallization, evaporation at high temperature and
under vacuum was only used for concentrating the SDS aqueous solution
up to an end point where a thick coagel was formed. A specific organic
solvent was then identified and added to the coagel at room temperature
at a given volume ratio to turn the binary SDS–water gelation
system into a clear ternary SDS–water–solvent solution
system for better flowing and mixing. An extra amount of the same
organic solvent was then slowly added to the clear SDS aqueous solution
as an antisolvent at room temperature at a particular volume ratio
of water to solvent for carrying out the antisolvent crystallization
step mainly for controlling the SDS hydrate form and its PSD. Cooling
crystallization, which goes from room temperature down to a lower
temperature at which point it is kept for a while, was employed primarily
for maximizing the yield and increasing the monodispersity of the
desired hydrate crystals. The experimental setups are demonstrated
in Figure S3. Commercial SDS cylindrical
granules of weight 25 g were dissolved in 50 mL of water in a 500
mL glass stirred tank at 25 °C and 200 rpm under 760 torr to
prepare a 33.3 wt % SDS aqueous solution. The stirred tank had an
inner diameter and height of 8.0 and 17 cm, respectively, and was
installed with a four-bladed 45° impeller having a diameter of
3.5 cm. The distance between the impeller and the tank bottom was
set to 1 cm. The SDS aqueous solution was then evaporated at 70 °C
by a water bath and 200 rpm under a partial pressure of 260 torr with
minimum foaming until the volume of water remaining decreased to 17
mL. Once the composition of the resulting SDS slurry had reached 60
wt % for about 3 h, the evaporation was stopped, which was the predetermined
end point for evaporation. The composition of the SDS solution was
monitored and deduced by weighing the water distillate collected in
the round-bottomed receiver. The solution was then cooled to 25 °C,
and the pressure was returned to 760 torr. Next, 34 mL of acetone,
which was two times the volume of 17 mL of water remaining in the
60 wt % concentrated SDS–water system, was introduced into
the glass stirred tank at a constant addition rate of 1 mL/s and agitation
rate of 200 rpm to make a free-flowing clear solution ready for the
next antisolvent crystallization step.

First, 255 mL of acetone
was added at slower rates in the beginning and then at higher rates
over the time period of 27 min into the solution by a cubic addition
method at 25 °C and under an agitation of 200 rpm to crystallize
the SDS·1/8 hydrate. Next, 255 mL of acetone, which was 15 times
the volume of the 17 mL of water remaining in the concentrated SDS
aqueous system, was divided into 10 equal portions of 25.5 mL each.
The time intervals for the addition of each portion through the addition
funnel into the glass stirred tank were shortened over time at 0,
5.0, 9.5, 13.5, 17.0, 20.0, 22.5, 24.5, 26.0, and 27.0 min. The accumulated
volume of acetone addition with time by cubic addition is displayed
in Figure S4.

Finally, the SDS–water-containing
acetone solution was cooled
to 5 °C in 30 min, and the SDS·1/8 hydrate crystals were
further aged in the water–acetone cosolvent at 5 °C for
8 h. The SDS·1/8 hydrate crystals were filtered, oven-dried at
40 °C for 8 h, and characterized by OM, FTIR, TGA, and PXRD.

Moisture Stability Test
Three open 20 mL scintillation
vials, each containing 0.5 g of SDS·1/8 hydrate crystals were
placed separately in three tightly capped 100 mL scintillation vials
filled with saturated MgCl2, Mg(NO3)2, and NaCl aqueous solutions at 25 °C, providing 25, 52, and
75% RH conditions, respectively, for 5 days. Afterward, the SDS·1/8
hydrate crystals exposed to different RH conditions were characterized
by TGA and PXRD.

The commercial SDS cylindrical granules were
dehydrated in TGA by heating to 150 °C at a heating ramp of 10
°C/min, holding isothermally for 5 min, and then cooling back
to 40 °C. The dehydrated SDS sample was characterized by PXRD
as soon as possible to minimize the time for air contact. Moreover,
the dehydrated SDS sample was then characterized by TGA again.

Instruments
OM
The crystal habits and PSD of harvested SDS solids
were observed by Olympus BX-51 (Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a digital
camera (Hong Kong, China) Moticam 2000. The obtained images were transformed
by Motic Image Plus (version 2.0) into digital photographs. Analysis
of the photographs was done by ImageJ 1.51 g software equipped with
Microscope Measurement Tools v1 plugin.

FTIR
FTIR spectroscopy
was utilized to verify the chemical
structure of SDS. FTIR spectroscopy was conducted on Perkin Elmer
Spectrum One (Norwalk, CT). Each sample was ground with KBr powders
with a weight ratio of about 1 to 100 in an agate mortar; then, a
hydraulic press was used to turn the powder mixture into a pellet.
The pellet was scanned 8 times with a resolution of 2 cm–1 ranging from 4000 to 400 cm–1.

TGA
TGA was employed to determine the dehydration temperature
and drying temperature. TGA analysis was conducted by Perkin-Elmer
TGA Pyris 1 (Norwalk, CT) to monitor the weight loss of the SDS sample
as a function of temperature. The stoichiometric ratios of water to
SDS in the hydrates were calculated from the weight loss. Samples
of 5–10 mg weight were placed on the open platinum pan suspended
in a heating furnace. All samples were heated under a nitrogen atmosphere
to avoid oxidization. The heating ramp was 10 °C/min ranging
from 40 to 350 °C.

DSC
DSC was used to measure the
dehydration temperature,
enthalpy of dehydration, solid–solid and solid–liquid
transition temperatures, and enthalpies of solid–solid and
solid–liquid transitions. Thermal analytical data of samples
in perforated aluminum sample pans were collected by PerkinElmer DSC
7 (Shelton, CT) at a temperature scanning rate of 10 °C/min from
40 to 210 °C under a constant nitrogen purge of 99.990%.

PXRD
PXRD was used to determine the crystal forms of
the samples by comparing the PXRD patterns of the samples with references
obtained from Cambridge Crystallography Data Center (CCDC). PXRD patterns
of SDS samples were obtained by Bruker D8 Advance (Karlsruhe, Germany).
The source of PXRD was Cu Kα (λ = 1.5418 Å), and
the diffractometer was operated at 40 keV and 25 mA passing through
a nickel filter. Samples were subjected to PXRD analysis with a sampling
width of 0.01° in a continuous mode at a scanning rate of 2°/min
over an angular range from 2θ = 5 to 35°.
