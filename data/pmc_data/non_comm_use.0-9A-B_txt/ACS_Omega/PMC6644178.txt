A low-cost,
platinum-free electrocatalyst for hydrogen (H2) generation
via the water splitting reaction holds great promise
to meet the demand of clean and sustainable energy sources. Recent
studies are mainly concerned with semiconducting materials like sulfides,
selenides, and phosphides of different transition metals as electrocatalysts.
Doping of the transition metals within the host matrix is a good strategy
to improve the electrocatalytic activity of the host material. However,
this activity largely depends on the nature of the dopant metal and
its host matrix as well. To exploit this idea, here, in the present
work, we have synthesized semiconducting Ag2S nanoparticles
and successfully doped them with different transition metals like
Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni to study their electrocatalytic activity for the
hydrogen evolution reaction from neutral water (pH = 7). Among the
systems doped with these transition metals, the Ni-doped Ag2S (Ni–Ag2S) system shows a very low overpotential
(50 mV) with high catalytic current in neutral water. The trend in
electrocatalytic activity of different transition metals has also
been explained. The Ni–Ag2S system also shows very
good stability in ambient atmosphere over a long period of time and
suffers no catalytic degradation in the presence of oxygen. Structural
characterizations are carried out using X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy to establish the phase purity and morphology of
the materials.

Introduction
The rapidly increasing
environmental hazards created due to burning
of fossil fuels and demand of nonconventional energy sources have
motivated researchers to explore a new class of renewable carbon-free
energy alternatives. Among the recently used traditional fuels, hydrogen
is advocated as a promising clean and renewable energy carrier. A
potential way to produce hydrogen is via water splitting either by
light or electricity. The vital step involved in water splitting is
the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which requires an efficient
catalyst to lower its large overpotential value. To produce hydrogen
fuel on a large scale, the electrocatalyst should have the capability
to work in aqueous solutions at neutral or near-to-neutral pH with
a small overpotential requirement and high catalytic rate.1 The state-of-the-art electrocatalysts used for
efficient hydrogen evolution reaction are Pt-group noble metals, but
unfortunately there is a limitation in their use for large-scale hydrogen
production because of their high price and low abundance. Therefore,
in the present situation, exploration of Pt-free, efficient, earth-abundant
electrocatalysts is highly desirable. There are several electrocatalysts
that have already been explored including different semiconductor
nanostructures of transition metal (TM) (Mo or W)-based sulfides,2−15 selenides,4,16−18 and phosphides,19−24 which show very promising electrocatalytic activity.25 However, most of the commonly used transition
metal dichalcogenides are in the semiconducting 2H phase with lower
conductivity. Because high conductivity promotes fast electron transfer
in the electrocatalytic reaction, recent electrocatalysts need further
improvement to enhance their HER performance. One of the finest strategies
to improve the HER performance is to increase the active sites that
act as molecular catalytic centers. However, the major problem of
these catalysts is the poor activity and limited stability in neutral
aqueous solution. Moreover, a little amount of oxygen can deactivate
the electrocatalyst through the formation of its oxide and therefore
during the long-term electrolysis process the cathode should be strictly
separated from the oxygen-generating anode to avoid the oxygenation
of the electrocatalyst.26 To address these
issues, further work is needed to design a new kind of electrocatalyst
that will be useful in acid-free aqueous medium and work efficiently
in aerobic conditions without losing its activity and stability. Thus,
there is enormous scope to design electrocatalysts that have good
conductivity and act in aerobic neutral medium where no extra source
of proton is available.

Catalytic water splitting with silver-based
electrocatalysts has
not yet been well explored. Being a very low band gap semiconductor
(∼1.1 eV), Ag2S has good electrical conductivity.
There are inadequate reports available on the electrocatalytic activity
of Ag2S.27−30 In addition, chemical doping of metal chalcogenides with transition
metals to tune the physical properties is an elegant approach.31,32 It has been proposed that transition metal (Fe, Ni, Co) doping adjacent
to sulfur edge sites can enhance the HER activity by lowering the
hydrogen adsorption free energy (ΔGH). Density functional theory calculations also support this fact.
However, the lowering of Gibbs free energy as well as the enhancement
of electrocatalytic activity depends on the nature of dopant metal
in the particular host material, and it varies from one system to
another system. In the case of MoS2, it has been reported
that Ni doping can enhance its HER activity almost 3 times.33 Actually, the transition-metal-doped MoS2 structure offers more active sites, which accelerate the
hydrogen evolution reaction. It is reported that a Zn-doped MoS2 structure shows superior catalytic activity toward HER, whereas
structures doped with other transition metals show less activity.34 In a recent study, it has been reported that
among different transition-metal-doped CoS2 structures,
Mn-doped CoS2 shows the best electrocatalytic activity,
which has been confirmed theoretically as well as experimentally.
Theoretical analysis reveals that among different transition metals
Mn is found to be the best dopant to have smallest Gibbs’ free
energy (ΔGH).35 With the concept of active sites and Gibbs free energy
of hydrogen adsorption, our intention is to find the appropriate transition
metal dopant that can accelerate the electrocatalytic activity of
the Ag2S system. In this regard, we have synthesized different
transition-metal (Mn, Fe, Co, Ni)-doped Ag2S nanoparticles
through the reflux technique and the materials are characterized by
different microstructural analyses like field emission gun transmission
electron microscopy (FEG-TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Doping
with every transition metal was confirmed by energy-dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy (EDS) analysis. We have carried out electrochemical measurements
with each of the four transition-metal-doped Ag2S nanoparticles
along with pristine Ag2S. It is seen that among all of
the doped systems Ni-doped Ag2S shows the best electrocatalytic
hydrogen evolution reaction, whereas Mn-, Fe-, and Co-doped Ag2S materials show less activity than that of even pristine
Ag2S. The Ni-doped Ag2S material shows a very
low overpotential of 50 mV with quite higher catalytic current in
neutral medium. The presence of Ni ions lowers the overpotential of
pristine Ag2S (∼175 mV) in neutral medium. The material
also has good stability toward hydrogen evolution even after 12 h
in aerobic conditions. It can be used easily in ambient atmosphere
without any activity loss. We have also measured the charge transfer
resistance of the sample by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
during HER. It gives an Rct of 882 Ω
at 50 mV potential, which gradually decreases to 120 Ω with
an increase in forward bias, suggesting efficient charge transfer
during HER.36 Moreover, the trend in electrocatalytic
activity of different transition-metal-doped Ag2S nanoparticles
has been explained by difference in electronegativity and hydration
enthalpy values of different transition metals with respect to silver.
Finally, doping of transition metal (e.g., Ni) into a low-band-gap
semiconductor (Ag2S) will result in a new pathway toward
an efficient hydrogen evolution reaction for green energy production.

Results
and Discussion
XRD
After successful synthesis of
Ag2S and
Ni-doped Ag2S (Ni–Ag2S), they are characterized
primarily by XRD.

Figure 1a,b shows the XRD patterns of Ni–Ag2S and
Ag2S, respectively. The XRD pattern represents sharp diffraction
peaks, which confirm the formation of a crystalline Ag2S nanostructure (JCPDS no. 140072). It is seen that upon addition
of very small amount of Ni there are no significant changes in the
XRD pattern, and only XRD peaks get slightly intense. This indicates
that substitution of silver by nickel does not remarkably change the
crystal lattice parameters. The absence of any extra peak also discards
the possibility of formation of a nickel sulfide phase during the
reaction process. Ag2S doped with a higher concentration
of Ni (Ni(L)–Ag2S) also shows no significant changes
in the XRD pattern, as given in the Supporting Information (Figure S1). We have also performed XRD analyses
of other transition-metal (Mn, Fe, Co)-doped Ag2S nanoparticles,
which have been shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S1). It is worth mentioning that there are no peak
shifts in the XRD patterns after incorporation of Ni/Mn/Fe/Co, which
indicates that these transition metals are very compatible for substitution
into the lattice structure of the Ag2S matrix and do not
form any other compounds. In Mn–Ag2S, a small hump
appears in the 10–30° region, which is due to the glass
on which XRD of the sample is performed.37

of Ag 3d of Ni–Ag2S; (d) XPS spectrum of Ni 2p of
Ni–Ag2S; and (e) deconvoluted spectra of S 2p of
Ni–Ag2S.

X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS)
The chemical
composition and oxidation states of the elements present in Ni–Ag2S have been further investigated by XPS analysis. Figure 1c shows high-resolution
XPS spectra of the Ag 3d region. The two main peaks are located at
367.86 eV (Ag 3d5/2) and 373.87 eV (Ag 3d3/2), which confirm the presence of the Ag+ oxidation state
in the Ni–Ag2S phase. No binding energy peak corresponding
to metallic silver has been detected that excludes the possibility
of formation of silver (Ag0) along with Ag2S.27,38

As shown in Figure 1d, the XPS spectrum of Ni 2p appears at binding energy values
of 853.8 eV (2p3/2) and 871.3 eV (2p1/2). This
indicates the presence of Ni2+ in the Ni–Ag2S structure.39 The binding energy
peaks of Ni 2p are less intense and broad in nature. This may be due
to the presence of low nickel content in the nanostructure. Figure 1e shows the high-resolution
deconvoluted spectra of S 2p. The deconvoluted spectra consist of
three peaks. Of these three peaks, two components are centered at
around 161.2 eV (2p3/2) and 162.4 eV (2p1/2).
These two peaks are separated by spin–orbit splitting of 1.2
eV. According to the literature, the S 2p XPS spectrum of Ag2S appears at around 160.7 eV (2p3/2) and 161.9 eV (2p1/2).38,40 This shifting in binding energy
(0.5 eV) in our case may be due to the successful doping of nickel
in Ag2S. The peak at around 163.8 eV indicates the presence
of elemental sulfer, which justifies the slight excess of sulfer in
the EDS analysis.

Microstructural Analysis
Figure 2 represents field
emission gun transmission
electron microscopy (FEG-TEM) images of the Ni–Ag2S nanostructure. As shown in the transmission electron micrographs
(Figure 2a–c),
the Ni-doped Ag2S nanoparticles with an average diameter
of 15–20 nm are grown.

Figure 2 (a–c) Low-resolution TEM images of Ni–Ag2S; (d) high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of Ni–Ag2S and the inset showing the fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern
of Ni–Ag2S; and (e) the corresponding EDS spectrum
of Ni–Ag2S.

Figure 2d
represents
the high-resolution TEM image of Ni–Ag2S. It clearly
shows the interplanar distances of 0.26 and 0.29 nm corresponding
to the (1̅21) and (1̅12) planes, respectively, and the
interplanar distance calculated from FFT (Figure 2d inset) is also found to be 0.265 nm, which
is in good agreement with the XRD analysis. No lattice fringes associated
with Ni or nickel sulfide phases have been detected. Therefore, to
confirm the doping of Ni in the Ag2S nanostructure, energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis has been carried out, which has
been shown in Figure 2e. The EDS spectrum of the material confirms the presence of Ni,
Ag, and S elements. The atomic percentage of Ag/Ni/S is found to be
62.08:0.56:37.36. This indicates very low Ni content and slight excess
of sulfur site in the Ni–Ag2S nanostructure. The
FEG-TEM images of other transition-metal-doped Ag2S nanoparticles
have been given in the Supporting Information (Figures S2–S4), which show very low atomic percentage
of transition metal doping and also confirm the absence of other phases
within the nanostructure. A higher percentage of Ni doping in Ni(L)–Ag2S has also been confirmed by EDS analysis given in the Supporting
Information (Figure S5).

To check
the Ni doping effect on the electrical conductivity of
Ag2S nanoparticles, we have also measured the electrical
conductivity of Ag2S and Ni–Ag2S as a
function of temperature, as shown in Figure S6. The standard four-probe method with pellet samples has been used
for conductivity measurements. It is seen that the conductivity of
both the samples is decreased exponentially with a decrease in temperature.
This confirms the semiconductor-like behavior of both samples. The
room temperature conductivities are found to be 8.4 × 10–3 and 5.5 × 10–3 S/m for Ag2S and Ni-doped Ag2S, respectively. Because of band
structure modulation, Ni doping caused some lowering of the electrical
conductivity of the virgin Ag2S nanoparticles. Doping of
a divalent transition metal (Ni2+) in the matrix of monovalent
Ag2S produces extra charge cloud on the Ni sites, which
act as additional scattering centres, and scattering of conduction
electrons with these decreases the conductivity of the doped material.

Performance of Electrocatalytic Activity in Hydrogen Evolution
Reaction (HER)
We have used pristine Ag2S and
different transition-metal-doped Ag2S nanoparticles as
the active electrocatalysts for HER processes. We have measured their
catalytic activity by linear sweep voltammetry experiments using the
standard three-electrode setup. Here, the as-synthesized materials
drop-casted on an indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated poly(ethylene terephthalate)
(PET) sheet (1 × 1 cm2) (see electrode preparation)
act as working electrodes and Ag/AgCl acts as a reference electrode.
The platinum (Pt) and glassy carbon electrode is used as a counter
electrode. For assessing the benefit of the electrocatalyst in practical
applications, we have carried out all of the experiments in neutral
medium (pH 7) under ambient conditions. We have used the KH2PO4–K2HPO4 buffer, pH 7,
solution and 100 mM KPF6 solution as the working electrolyte
and supporting electrolyte, respectively, in all of the cases.

In the first step, we have checked the HER activity of the as-synthesized
Ag2S nanoparticles at pH 7. This shows ∼175 mV overpotential
toward HER, as shown in Figure 3a. To check the effect of doping of transition metal (TM)
in Ag2S nanoclusters, we have carried out HER measurements
also on Ag2S nanoparticles doped with different TMs like
Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni. Among them, Ni is found to be the best dopant
candidate toward HER activity, whereas other dopants (Mn, Fe, and
Co) show very low activity compared to that of even pristine Ag2S nanoparticles. Ni-doped Ag2S shows a very low
onset potential of 50 mV with very high current density. However,
Co-, Fe-, and Mn-doped systems show quite higher onset potentials
of ∼210, 350, and 485 mV, respectively, with moderate current
density, as shown in Figure 3a. From Figure 3a, we see that for pristine Ag2S the cathodic current
starts to increase at around 70 mV overpotential and that after 170
mV it increases rapidly. However, for Ni-doped Ag2S nanoparticles,
the overpotential drastically decreases. After only 5 mV overpotential,
the cathodic current starts to increase, and then it increases rapidly
after 50 mV.

plots; (c) Nyquist plots at different overpotentials during the HER
process with Ni–Ag2S in neutral medium; and (d)
stability test of Ni–Ag2S in neutral medium and
aerobic atmosphere.

The order of electrocatalytic
activity is Ni–Ag2S ≫ Ag2S >
Co–Ag2S > Fe–Ag2S > Mn–Ag2S. These results are well explained
by considering electronegativity and hydration enthalpies of the TM
dopants. Due to the diagonal relationship, silver (Ag) and nickel
(Ni) have similarity in their chemical properties including their
electronegativity values. As we go from Ni to Mn, the absolute electronegativity
values of the metals decrease and therefore difference between the
electronegativity of metal and sulfide increases, resulting in the
enhancement of negative charge density on sulfur, which strongly adsorbs
H+ ions from water. Because of this enhancement in negative
charge density, desorption/release of hydrogen will be much more slower.2 Apart from this trend in electrocatalytic activity,
it is found that electrocatalytic activity increases sharply when
Ag2S is doped with Ni atoms. Although the electronegativity
values of Ni and Ag are almost the same, still Ag2S shows
much better electrocatalytic activity when it is doped with nickel.
Here, hydration enthalpy plays a key role. Ni has a much higher value
of hydration enthalpy compared to that of Ag as well as other transition
metals (Fe, Co, Mn). Therefore, it has the ability to attract more
water molecules from the system to form a nickel aqua complex. Being
a Lewis acid, Ni can attract the electron cloud from H2O molecules, which makes proton release easier during the hydrogen
evolution reaction. In the present case, doping of bivalent Ni in
the monovalent Ag site in Ag2S produces an extra positive
charge cloud on the Ni sites, which will effectively attract the electron
cloud of H2O molecules to release proton easily during
the hydrogen evolution reaction.

The electrocatalytic activity
order of different transition-metal
(TM)-doped Ag2S nanoclusters has been further verified
with higher doping concentration samples. Although the onset potentials
are increased, the trend of electrocatalytic activity is very similar
to that with lower doping concentration samples, as shown in Figure S7. This result also confirms the activeness
of lower doping concentrations in Ag2S nanoparticles. Furthermore,
to examine any effect of Pt dissolution, we have further checked the
electrocatalytic activity of Ag2S and Ni–Ag2S using the glassy carbon electrode (non-Pt electrode) as
the counter electrode under similar conditons.41 In Figure S8, we do not see
any difference from our previous results. Therefore, it is confirmed
that platinum (Pt) has no role in improving the electrocatalytic activity
of our synthesized materials.

To carry out a detailed study
of the HER activity, we have investigated
the kinetics of the process by plotting Tafel slopes and fitted with
the equation η = a + b log(j) (where b is the Tafel slope). Three
principal steps are used in the conversion of 2H+ to H2, commonly referred to as the Volmer (eq 1), Heyrovsky (eq 2), and Tafel (eq 3) equations. 1   2   3  Combinations
of steps (eqs 1 and 2) or (eqs 1 and 3), i.e., Volmer–Heyrovsky
or Tafel–Volmer, can lead
to the production of molecular H2. A relatively smaller
Tafel slope indicates the Tafel–Volmer mechanism, whereas a
higher Tafel slope gives the Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism during
the HER process. In our case, all of the materials show quite higher
Tafel slopes and the Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism has been operated.
Pristine Ag2S shows a Tafel slope of 154 mV/dec, and all
of the TM-doped Ag2S also show quite higher Tafel slopes
except for the Ni-doped system. It shows a quite lower Tafel slope
of 99 mV/dec for the Ni–Ag2S system. These results
also support our proposed explanation of higher hydration enthalpy
of Ni for greater HER activity compared to other TM doped Ag2S nano systems.

To check the electron transfer process in the
Ni–Ag2S system, we have measured the change of resistance
of the
sample during the HER process. From the Nyquist plot in Figure 3c, it is clearly seen that
Ni–Ag2S has the resistance in a megaohm (MΩ)
range before starting the HER process. Just after the commencement
of HER, the resistance drops suddenly to 1.5 kΩ. As we have
increased the applied potential, the resistance decreased sharply.
Therefore, this strongly supports the charge transfer effect in the
system during this HER process. The resistance (882 Ω) corresponding
to charge transfer at 50 mV potential decreases to only 120 Ω
with the increasing bias and suggests that better charge transfer
makes the electrocatalyst more conducting during the HER process.
Nyquist plots of bare Ag2S and Mn-, Fe-, and Co-doped Ag2S nanoparticles have been given in the Supporting Information
(Figure S9).

In addition to low overpotential,
the long-term stability of the
electrocatalyst in aerobic conditions is another important parameter
for its practical use. The durability of the material (Ni–Ag2S) has been assessed at neutral pH as well as in aerobic conditions.
From Figure 3d, we
can see that our synthesized material is quite stable after 14 h of
electrocatalysis even at a higher overpotential (200 mV). Thus, our
material shows quite good activity in aerobic conditions. We have
also performed different characterizations like XRD and FEG-TEM of
our Ni–Ag2S sample after the HER experiment to observe
any structural changes in it. No significant structural changes have
been observed for the nanostructure, as shown in Figure S10. Thus, this Ni-doped Ag2S material can
be explored as an effective electrocatalyst in HER at pH 7 regarding
its practical applications.

Conclusions
In
summary, to explore a transition-metal-doped, low-band-gap,
and air-stable electrocatalyst toward the hydrogen evolution reaction
(HER), we have successfully synthesized different transition-metal
(Mn, Fe, Co, Ni)-doped Ag2S nanoparticles via a simple
wet chemical synthesis route. Among them, Ag2S doped with
Ni shows the best electrocatalytic activity in neutral water medium,
where nickel doping lowers Gibbs’ free energy of hydrogen adsorption,
resulting in a very low overpotential of 50 mV. It also shows very
good stability (>12 h) in ambient atmosphere. The charge transfer
resistance (Rct) is also found to be as
low as 120 Ω under the bias voltage indicating superior charge
transport for better HER.

Experimental Section
Chemicals
Silver
nitrate (AgNO3), nickel
chloride hexahydrate (NiCl2·6H2O), manganese
chloride (MnCl2), ferric chloride (FeCl3), cobalt
chloride (CoCl2), oleylamine, 1-dodecanethiol, potassium
hexafluorophosphate (KPF6), and pH 7 buffer are purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich. Disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4·2H2O) and all of the spectroscopy-grade
solvents like n-hexane, ethanol, and acetone are
bought from Merck Chemicals. All of the chemicals are of analytical
grade and used as received.

Synthesis of Catalysts
The Ni-doped
Ag2S
nanoparticle has been synthesized by a one-step temperature-controlled
reflux method. Typically, 0.5 mmol of AgNO3 and 0.005 mmol
of NiCl2·6H2O have been taken in 5 mL of
oleylamine and allowed to stir under an inert atmosphere to form a
homogeneous mixture. Then, 25 mL of 1-dodecanethiol is added to the
mixture and the solution is allowed to keep at 120 °C for 1 h.
Then, the resultant light green solution is slowly heated upto 240
°C and kept at this temperature for 1.5 h. The resultant blackish-gray
solution is cooled down to room temperature, and a small amount of
hexane is added to this solution. Precipitation is obtained by addition
of excess ethanol and acetone to the solution. The final product is
obtained by washing the precipitate several times by the re-precipitation
method.

Mn-, Fe-, and Co-doped Ag2S nanoparticles
were prepared by the same procedure with addition of MnCl2, FeCl3, and CoCl2 (i.e., 0.005 mmol), respectively.

Pure Ag2S is obtained by following the same procedure
without addition of the transition metal salt.

To check the
effect of doping concentration, we have also synthesized
another batch of doped Ag2S nanoparticles, namely, M(L)–Ag2S (M = Ni/Mn/Fe/Co) with a higher concentration of transition
metal halides (0.01 mmol) following the same procedure.

Physical Characterization
of Ag2S, Mn–Ag2S, Fe–Ag2S, Co–Ag2S, and
Ni–Ag2S
Microscopic structures of these
materials are determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM),
and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) has also been performed
to analyze the elemental composition. A PPMS system with a closed-cycle
cryostat (Janis) having a cold head (Sumitomo) has been used for the
conductivity measurement of the samples. X-ray diffraction has been
carried out by a X-ray diffractometer (RICH SEIFERT-XRD 3000P) using
an X-ray generator (Cu, 10 kV, 10 mA, and wavelength 1.5418 Å).
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is performed using an OMICRON-0571
system. TEM is performed using JEOL 2011, which is equipped with an
EDS tool. All of the electrochemical measurements are carried out
using an electrochemical analyzer, model CHI760E.

Electrode Preparation
For the three-electrode system,
we have used Pt (CHI760E) as the counter electrode, Ag/AgCl (CHI760E)
as the reference electrode, and our as-synthesized different-transition-metal-doped
Ag2S as well as bare Ag2S as the working electrodes.
To prepare the working electrode, we have taken 5 mL of the as-synthesized
Ag2S in hexane solvent and sonicated it for 30 min to prepare
a homogeneous dispersion. Then, we have drop-cast the sample over
a 1 × 1 cm2 ITO-coated poly(ethylene terephthalate)
(PET) sheet to make the working electrode. Finally, we have dried
the electrode in a vacuum oven before use.
