Of late,
novel magnetic nanomaterials have drawn worldwide attention because
of the uniqueness in their properties and uses. In our studies, we
have prepared nearly monodisperse zero-valent iron nanoparticles (nZVIs)
of diameter of less than 60 nm in aqueous medium by a reductive precipitation
process and pectin as stabilizing agent. The characterization of these
nanoparticles was done by dynamic light scattering and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) techniques. The TEM images confirmed that
the average size of the nZVIs was about 25 nm. The resultant nZVIs
were then employed to degrade DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane)
in spiked soil, and their toxicity toward Collembola (Folsomia candida) and Ostracods (Heterocypris
incongruens) was measured. The fabricated nZVIs degraded
DDT in soil quite effectively. Further, the effects of nZVIs on Collembola
and Ostracods were found to be negative. This was due to the oxidation
of nZVIs and creation of anoxic conditions thereupon, and the generation
of excess Fe(II) in soil. In addition, the negative effects of DDT
on ostracod development and Collembola reproduction were found to
be quite weak.

==== Body
Introduction
DDT [1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane],
an organochlorine pesticide, is
in use extensively worldwide since the 1940s to control agricultural
pests and vector-borne diseases like typhus, malaria, yellow fever,
encephalitis, and so forth.1−3 It is a persistent organic pollutant, a potent carcinogen, a known
teratogen, and an endocrine disruptor.4 DDT and its metabolites have also been shown to cause chronic effects
on the nervous system, the liver, the kidneys, and the immune system.
Although it has been regulated under the Stockholm convention5 and banned by many western countries in the 1970s
owing to environmental concern and toxicity to humans and wildlife,
DDT and its metabolites are still found at many places in the world
because of their persistency, bioaccumulation, and long-range atmospheric
transport.3,6−10 Their persistency in the environment is attributed to their long
half-life, which stretches from 4 to 30 years.11 India is yet to ban the production and use of this compound.

Several physical, chemical, and biological methods have been employed
to mitigate the menace of DDT and its metabolites from the environment.
Some of them are soil excavation,12 incineration,13 washing the contaminated soil with surfactants,14 oxidation processes like chemical oxidation,15 as well as advanced oxidation processes (AOPs)
using semiconductor photocatalysts,16 catalytic
reactions using metal catalysts like Pd/C,17,18 and
bioremediation treatments.3 Among these,
AOPs using photocatalysts and metal-catalyzed reactions have been
found promising but their prohibitive cost and cumbersome process
make them less attractive. More recently, the use of zero-valent iron
(ZVI) to degrade DDT in water and soil has become an attractive process
because of its ability to remove all chlorines much faster than natural
processes under moderate conditions.19,20 Moreover, ZVI
is inexpensive and environmental friendly. Compared to bulk or macro-scale
ZVI, nanoscale ZVI offers larger surface area with high surface activity.
Because of their small size, zero-valent iron nanoparticles (nZVIs)
can be injected and transported easily in porous media. nZVIs have
been successfully used for transformation and detoxification of common
environmental pollutants including chlorinated organic compounds (COCs)
and pesticides.21−25 Of late, some
researchers have shown that nZVIs can be used to degrade DDT and its
metabolites effectively. In one such study, the concentrations of
DDT residues in a contaminated soil were reduced by about 40 percent
in 28 h through nZVI addition.26 Similarly,
El-Temsah et al.27 reported 45 percent
reduction in DDT concentration when treating columns containing DDT-contaminated
soil with nZVI suspensions. It was also reported that DDT degradation
was slower with micron-sized ZVI particles compared to nZVIs.10 Such studies have affirmed that DDT degradation
by nZVIs in a contaminated soil is indeed possible.

ZVI is an
effective reductant (Ev0 = −0.44 V) and is capable of
reducing COCs like DDT by reductive dehalogenation.28 The mechanism of this reaction involves the transfer of
electrons from metallic iron (Fe0) to chlorinated organics
which undergo reductive dechlorination. 1   2  

Thermodynamically, the coupling of reactions 1 & 2 are energetically favorable. 3  

Dechlorination is also possible when there is transformation of Fe2+ to Fe3+.

Several synthetic approaches to
fabricate nZVI particles have been reported in the literature. In
this study, nZVIs, however, have been synthesized by the reductive
precipitation of iron(III) salts, a conventional wet chemical method.
The colloidal chemistry of these particles is such that they tend
to agglomerate.29 Therefore, various types
of water-soluble organic polymeric coatings like starch, sodium carboxymethyl
cellulose, or pectin are used nowadays to prevent their agglomeration
and enhance stability.30−34 These polymeric
surfactants provide long-range steric repulsion forces to particles
and eventually achieve their stabilization.

nZVIs are considered
as the single largest variety of engineered nanomaterials entering
the environment.35 Despite their use in
environmental protection processes for the last 2 decades, the ecotoxicological
studies of nZVIs are limited. As a result, their large-scale use in
environmental remediation is hampered. However, they are reportedly
toxic to pure bacterial cultures of Escherichia coli,36,37Pseudomonas fluorescens, and bacillus subtilis var. niger.38 The lack of their proper ecotoxicological data
and hitherto unknown harmful effects on organisms has hampered the
large-scale use of this technology around the world.

The objectives
of the present work were to (i) synthesize nZVIs, (ii) identify a
good stabilizing agent which prevents the agglomeration of synthesized
nZVIs, and (iii) use the synthesized nZVIs against DDT in soil slurries
and assessment of their toxicity toward Collembola and Ostracods as
they represent the key soil organisms in their respective environment.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals & Reagents
Fe(III) chloride, Sodium borohydride,
and pectin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, USA). HPLC-grade
ethanol and acetone were obtained from Bioexon, Delhi. Soil and Collembola
were obtained from Kerala, and the Ostracodtox kit from Micro BioTests
Inc. Kleimoer Mariakerke (Gent) Belgium.

Synthesis of nZVIs
Synthesis of iron nanoparticles
was carried out in aqueous solution by reducing ferric ions with sodium
borohydride according to a protocol formulated by Wang and Zhang21 with minor modifications, and followed by capping
those with pectin obtained from citrus peel. Briefly, 500 mg of pectin
was dissolved in 50 mL of Millipore water in a three-necked RB flask
fitted with septa around its necks and 0.05 M FeCl3 solution
was added to it. It was then deaerated by passing N2 gas
for 1 h. In another RB flask, 50 mL of 0.3 M of NaBH4 solution
was prepared and it was purged with nitrogen gas for 15 min. Then,
this deaerated NaBH4 solution was added dropwise to the
above ferric chloride solution in an inert atmospheric condition under
vigorous stirring. After some time, the color of the solution turns
grayish black because of the formation of nZVIs. The above black-colored
solution was centrifuged to separate the black-colored iron nanoparticles.
These iron NPs were washed thrice with deoxygenated water, thrice
with absolute ethanol, and once with acetone. These particles were
then dried in a vacuum oven (oxygen-free) at 40 °C. The above
particles can be preserved under a layer of acetone for a long period
of up to 6 months. The prepared particles were studied further for
characterization.

Characterization
of Iron Nanoparticles
Dynamic Light
Scattering
Dynamic light scattering (DLS) technique was used
to determine the hydrodynamic diameters of iron nanoparticles in suspension.

Transmission Electron Microscopy
Images of the iron nanoparticles were recorded by transmission
electron microscopy (TEM). Sample preparation was done by depositing
few droplets of the stable nZVI suspension in water on a formvar-coated
copper grid and allowing it to dry in a vacuum oven at room temperature.

DDT Degradation Experiment
Soil (100 gm, pH 5.9), amended with 40 mg DDT/kg soil, was incubated
with 200 mL of an nZVI suspension at 1, 5, and 10 g/kg soil in a 500
mL glass bottle at 30 °C. The incubation was carried out on a
rotatory shaker at constant rpm for 7, 15, 21, and 28 days and the
bottles were aerated by opening them once a day for 30 s. After the
predetermined time of incubation, the suspension was centrifuged,
and the supernatant and the solid phase were separated using Whatman
filter paper for DDT analysis.

DDT
Extraction and Analysis
The dry soil sample (6 g) was dissolved
in a 100 mL mixture of hexane and acetone (1:1 ratio) in a 150 mL
glass bottle and the suspension was incubated on a horizontal shaker,
fixed at a constant rpm, for 60 min. Then, 30 mL of triple-distilled
water was added to it and the resulting emulsion was incubated for
another 10 min. The emulsion was centrifuged (671g, 5 min) to obtain phase separation. A 2 mL aliquot of the upper
hexane phase was taken into gas chromatography (GC) glass vials for
analysis by GC–mass spectrometry using a 0.2 mm × 50 m
column and 1 mL/min He as carrier gas. A 2 μL sample was injected
into a split/split less injector at an initial oven temperature of
75 °C, whereas the injector temperature was 240 °C and the
column temperature was 300 °C. The total DDT recovery from the
soil was 90.1 ± 5.2%.

Ecotoxicity
Studies
Ostracod Toxicity
A 6 day direct contact microbio test for mortality/growth-inhibition
of Ostracods (Heterocypris incongruens) was performed according to the standard test protocol of Ostracodtoxkit
F (Micro-Bio Tests, Nazareth, Belgium), using 24-well trays. Each
Ostracodtoxkit F is equipped with all the disposable materials to
carry out 3–5 bioassays. Other equipment, in addition to Ostracodtoxkit
F, needed for the test were an incubator [25 °C (±1 °C)],
a dissecting microscope (magnification 10–12×), and normal
laboratory glassware. Three replicates of each soil treatment were
taken into account in this study. The study was conducted by taking
0.4 g of soil (dry weight) in each well and mixing it thoroughly with
1 mL of medium-hard EPA water (Ostracodtoxkit F). The soil was then
left to settle. Live algae suspension (1 mL)(food for Ostracods) and
five neonate Ostracods were added to each well. Parafilm was used
to seal the test tray. It was then covered by a lid and kept under
darkness in an incubator, maintained at 25 °C (±1 °C).
After 6 days of incubation, microsieving of the contents of each well
was carried out to separate the Ostracods. Mortality and growth of
the surviving Ostracods were then determined. Length measurements
of surviving Ostracods were carried out by unique micrometric slips
provided with each Ostracodtoxkit. % growth inhibition (GI) of Ostracods
was calculated as: GI = 100 – (A/B × 100), where A is growth of Ostracods in
the reference sediment, B is growth of Ostracods
in the treatment.

Collembola Tests
We followed the standard protocol39 and
accordingly 10 Collembola were added to treated and untreated soil
following the incubation of 7, 15, 21, and 28 days. About 30 g of
soil samples from each category were taken in plastic cylinders of
height 6 cm and inner diameter 4.2 cm. A small space in the cylinder
cover was left for respiration of Collembola. Dried baker’s
yeast weighing about 15 mg was added onto the top soil to serve as
food for Collembola. All these tests were conducted when the soil’s
water-holding capacity was about 50%. The test cylinders were maintained
at 20 °C with an alternate light and dark cycle of 16:8 h at
400–800 lux. The test species’ reproduction process
took 4 weeks to complete, and thereafter adults and juveniles were
counted after flotation according to Skovlund et al.40

Fe(II) Extract from Soil
Following the incubation period of 7, 15, 21 and 28 days, about
0.5 g of soil was taken in a glass vial to which 5 mL of 0.5 M HCl
was added and the entire content was mixed by swirling for 30 s. The
whole mixture was then left for 1 h at room temperature. Then, 0.1
mL extract of the above mixture was added to 5 mL of ferrozine (1
g/L) in 50 mM HEPES (N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N′-2-ethanesulfonic acid) and the solution was maintained
at pH 7 by adding NaOH. The determination of Fe(II) content was done
spectrophotometrically by measuring the absorbance of the supernatant
at 562 nm. During the extraction process, Fe(II) was neither oxidized
nor Fe(III) was reduced. Similarly, another soil sample of the same
quantity was extracted by the above-described method with the exception
that the extractant was 5 mL of hydroxylamine hydrochloride (0.25
M) in HCl (0.25 M). Fe(III) is reduced to Fe(II) under acidic conditions
by hydroxylamine. The calculated difference between the Fe(II) obtained
in the hydroxylamine and HCl extractions was taken as the amount of
hydroxylamine-reducible Fe(III).

A wide range of concentrations
of Fe(II) (FeSO4), Fe(III) (FeCl3), nZVIs, and
DDT were used to establish standard toxicity curves for Ostracods
to determine LC50 and EC50. Ostracods were exposed to soil spiked with DDT, nZVIs, Fe(II), and Fe(III).

In Vitro Study
Hemolysis Assay
Blood sample (5 mL) was
collected from an anonymous human donor. It was drawn directly into
K2-EDTA-coated Vacutainer tubes to prevent coagulation
and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was discarded.
RBCs were washed thrice with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS),
pH 7.4, for 5 min. and washed erythrocytes were finally suspended
in 1× PBS (1:9 dilution). To study hemolysis, 950 μL of
the above suspension was mixed with a 50 μL solution of nanoparticles
of different concentrations to obtain 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and
1 g/mL of nanoparticles with RBC suspension, and also the 1:9 diluted
RBC suspension was mixed with Triton X-100 to make 1% solution for
complete lysis of the erythrocytes. RBCs suspended in 1 mL of PBS
were used as negative control to assess background lysis, if any.
Each suspension was incubated at 37 °C for 15, 30, 60, 120, and
180 min. After the predetermined time of incubation, the suspension
was centrifuged, and the supernatant was analyzed using a spectrophotometer
at 540 nm. The percentage of hemolysis was determined by the following
equation  where Abso is the absorption of the blank sample, abss is the absorption of the sample, and Abs100 is
the absorption of the sample treated with Triton X-100.

MTT Assay
It is used to measure the in
vitro cytotoxicity of the synthesized nanoparticles at different concentrations
on specimen cells. Cell viability, as opposed to cytotoxicity, is
measured by this method to assess the cytotoxicity. Cell viability
can be determined on the basis of their mitochondrial dehydrogenase
activities. For metabolically active cells, the mitochondrial activities
remain constant and any variations in them are reflected in the numbers
of active cells. The mitochondrial activity of cells is assessed by
the conversion of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium
bromide (MTT) to formazan crystals by mitochondrial enzymes. Therefore,
any changes in mitochondrial activity will be reflected on the formation
of formazan. By measuring the concentration of formazan formed, one
can estimate the number of viable cells. For this purpose, macrophages
were collected from sodium thioglycolate-stimulated mice, which were
then put into a growth medium, RPMI 1640 (incomplete). It was then
centrifuged at 1400g for 10 min at 4 °C, washed
twice by PBS, and again put in the growth medium (complete). Macrophages
at a density of 1 × 106 cells mL–1 were seeded in 96-well tissue culture plates at 0.1 mL per well,
and were then exposed to various concentrations of nZVIs (0.1, 0.2,
0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 1 g/mL) for 12 h in an incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. After incubation, the formazan crystals formed
were made soluble by dissolving in DMSO solvent and their absorbance
measurements were done later at 492 nm. The absorbance at 492 nm represented
the total number of viable cells. LD50 values for different
concentrations of nZVIs were calculated from the dose–response
curve. The mean percentage of viable cells was calculated as follows  

Results and Discussion
DLS Analysis
DLS, also known as photon correlation
spectroscopy (PCS), is a technique used to determine the size and
size distribution profile of submicron particles in suspension. The
particles’ size distribution is calculated from their erratic
motion or diffusion using Stokes–Einstein equation, d = kBT/3πηD, where kB is the Boltzmann
constant, T is the absolute temperature, η
is the solvent viscosity, D is the diffusion coefficient,
and d is the hydrodynamic diameter of the particle.
In this DLS technique, a vertically polarized He–Ne laser of
wavelength 632.8 nm was passed through a dilute nanoparticle suspension
and the intensity of the scattered light was collected on an autocorrelator.
CONTIN algorithms were used in the Laplace inversion of the autocorrelation
function to obtain the size distribution.41 The particles size analysis of the nZVIs was performed by DLS at
25 °C (DLS/Malvern Instrument, PCS). The number average mean
hydrodynamic sizes of iron nanoparticles at 0.05 M aqueous solution
of FeCl3 was 29 nm (Figure 1), with a narrow polydispersity index (0.11–0.16).

Figure 1 Hydrodynamic size of ZVIs was found to be 29 nm with narrow
polydispersity.

TEM Analysis
TEM micrographs
of nZVIs synthesized by borohydride reduction method (reduction of
aqueous solution of FeCl3 by NaBH4) are shown
in Figure 2. The mean
diameter of the synthesized nZVIs, obtained from the TEM image, was
found to be 25 nm with spherical shape and low polydispersity.

Figure 2 Well-defined nanoscale, high monodispersity,
and low polydispersity
were obtained from TEM micrograph. It is apparent that they are 25
± 2 nm in diameter.

DDT Degradation Study
The degradation
of DDT in soil with 1, 5, and 10 g nZVI/kg soil after 7, 15, 21, and
28 days of incubation is shown in Figure 3. The amounts of DDT degraded in the nZVIs’
treatments were significant compared to controls without nanoparticles.
It was observed that after 7 days of incubation, the concentration
of DDT in treatments was lowest for the lowest concentration of added
nZVI. Addition of 1 and 5 g of nZVI/kg soil thus resulted in 58.3
and 29.62% degradation of DDT (as the sum of DDT and its degradation
products), respectively, after 7 days, whereas it was only 18.87%
with 10 g nZVI/kg soil (comparable to control). At the highest dose
of nZVIs, the DDT degradation continued for the entire incubation
period of 28 days, whereas no additional degradation was observed
for the lowest dose of nZVIs during the incubation period spanning
from 7 to 28 days.

Figure 3 Residual concentrations
of DDT in soil, spiked
with 40 mg DDT/kg soil, and incubated with 1, 5, or 10 g nZVIs/kg
soil for 7, 15, 21, and 28 days in soil slurries.

The results of the above study showed that
nZVIs are capable of degrading DDT. In our control treatments, it
was observed that in the absence of nZVIs, there were no significant
changes in concentrations of DDT in spiked soil during the entire
incubation period of 28 days. This was attributed to the recalcitrant
and persistent nature of DDT. Thus, in treated soil, nZVIs were clearly
responsible for the degradation of DDT. It was also observed from
the data that after an incubation period of 7 days, a dose of 1 g
nZVI/kg soil reduced the level of DDT faster than the dose at 10 g
nZVI/kg soil. This was probably because of increased reduction of
organochlorine compounds like DDT in the presence of excess electrons
released by the complete and extensive oxidation of nZVIs. However,
the degradation capability of 1 g nZVI/kg soil did not find any improvement
when the incubation period was extended from 7 to 28 days. This could
be due to the oxidation process and consequent formation of hydroxide
substances on particles’ surface, which might have retarded
the reactivity of nZVIs. On the other hand, when similar experiments
were carried out using macrosized ZVIs, the degradation efficiency
was quite low. Yao et al., 200642 found
that DDT degradation in spiked soil was very low even after adding
high concentrations of macrosized ZVIs (50 g ZVIs/kg soil for 1 week
resulted in 70% degradation of DDT). nZVIs offer larger surface area
compared to ZVIs and the reductive interactions of chlorinated contaminants
like DDT with iron particles is proportional to latter’s surface
area (Table 1).20

Toxicity Study
Collembola Mortality Study
Collembola
(Folsomia candida) are one of the most
abundant groups of soil arthropods. Toxicity of nZVIs in soil can
be assessed by studying its toxic effects on soil arthropods like
Collembola as they are abundant on the top soil. Mortality and reproduction
of juveniles have been used as the basis to measure the toxicity of
nZVIs toward Collembola. The results of our study when Collembola
were exposed to 1, 5, and 10 g nZVIs/kg soil for 28 days are shown
in Figure 4. Negative
effects on both adult and juvenile Collembola were quite significant
(p < 0.05) in test soil compared to control soil
(without nZVIs and DDT). It was also observed that toxicity of nZVIs
toward Collembola after an incubation period of 28 days was significantly
lower than that after 7, 15, and 21 days of incubation when the test
species were exposed to nZVIs at 1, 5, and 10 g/kg soil concentrations.
After an incubation period of 7 days, there was 100% mortality when
adult Collembola were exposed to any of the above nZVI concentrations
in soil, whereas mortality reduced to 65, 75, and 89% for the dose
of 1, 5, and 10 g nZVIs/kg soil, respectively, after an incubation
of 28 days because of reduced toxicity. In addition, the negative
effect of fresh nZVI suspension on adult and juvenile Collembola was
quite high. On the contrary, there were no significant negative effects
on adults by DDT alone. However, in soil spiked with DDT alone, no
juveniles were observed. Irrespective of the length of the incubation
period, no juveniles were found on any of the soils treated with three
different concentrations of nZVIs (Table 2).

Iron
Concentrations in DDT-Contaminated Soil
The solid phase iron
concentrations in DDT-spiked soil slurry after 28 days of incubation
are shown in Figure 5. Addition of both 1 and 5 g of nZVIs/kg soil slightly increased
Fe(II) concentrations in the DDT-spiked soil in comparison to control,
whereas a dose of 10 g of nZVIs/kg soil in the spiked soil increased
solid phase Fe(II) and Fe(III) concentrations significantly as shown
in Figure 5.

solid phases from slurries of DDT-spiked soils after 28 days of incubation

Toxicity Effects on Ostracods
Ostracods
are sediment dwellers and are found in abundance in top soil. The
toxicity studies of nZVIs in the ostracod population reflect the toxicity
of the whole sample soil matrix. Ostracods (H. incongruens) as test organisms have been successfully used earlier to assess
the toxicity of the soil.27 Ostracods are
very sensitive to nZVIs in both water and soil. This could be due
to the creation of anoxic conditions following initial oxidation of
nZVIs. In support of this assumption, it was observed that the mortality
of Ostracods decreased rapidly as the slurry was subjected to prolonged
incubation before test. The longer incubation period was able to supply
enough oxygen to end the anoxic conditions developed at the early
stage of incubation. Further, mortality remained high in treatments
which received higher doses of nZVIs. At a higher dose, nZVIs consume
more oxygen because of their oxidation and create a state of anoxia,
which cause death among ostracods. From EC50 thresholds
of the individual components, as shown in Figure 6, it was observed that toxicity of nZVIs
is lower than that of either DDT or Fe(II). Therefore, the ostracod
mortality by nZVIs could be indirect. When studying the toxic effects
of nZVIs on medaka fish larvae, Chen et al.43 concluded that hypoxia was caused by nZVIs because of consumption
of oxygen, and the Fe(II) released in the process caused toxicity
because of generation of reactive oxygen species. Toxicity of nanoparticles
is also explained on the basis of their indirect link to food depletion,44 which seems irrelevant in this case (Table 3).

In Vitro Study
Hemolysis
Assay of nZVIs
The results of the hemolytic experiments indicate
that the pectin-capped iron nanoparticles greatly increase the blood
compatibility and remain nontoxic up to 1 mg/mL to erythrocytes. The
results significantly emphasize the usefulness of iron nanoparticles
for the soil and water treatment processes apart from their use against
many diseases (Figure 7),
(Table 4).

MTT Assay
From the MTT assay, a dose-dependent
response was observed and LD50 values were calculated.
Cytotoxicity data for the pectin-capped iron nanoparticles and the
macrophages are presented (Figure 8). The LD50 values presented for different
concentrations of iron nanoparticles were found to be nontoxic after
12 h of exposure time. The LD50 values calculated from
the MTT assay are 0.1 g/mL (confidence interval ± 1.09), 0.2
g/mL (confidence interval ± 1.09), 0.3 g/mL (confidence interval
± 1.09), and 0.4 g/mL (confidence interval ± 1.09), 0.5
g/mL (confidence interval ± 1.09), and 1 g/mL (confidence interval
± 2.97), for the 25 nm nZVIs. This shows that the particles have
negligible cytotoxicity in comparison to Triton X-100 (Table 5).

Conclusions
In this study, we synthesized
well-defined monodisperse pectin-capped nZVIs, which were used to
study the degradation of DDT in spiked soil. Pectin-capped nZVIs are
generally used in the field of biomedical sciences and are rarely
used in environmental remediation. However, our study showed that
the degradation rates of DDT in spiked soil by pectin-capped nZVIs
were as good as that of earlier studies taken up by nZVIs capped with
other polymers. Hence, pectin-capped nZVIs could be a promising and
effective material against soil pollutants like DDT. The ecotoxicity
of nZVIs on soil biota was studied by taking Collembola and Ostracods
as test species as these are predominantly sediment dwellers. The
negative effects of nZVIs on mortality and growth of both Collembola
and Ostracods were quite severe, whereas the negative effects of DDT
on reproduction of Collembola and development of Ostracods were very
weak. It was also observed that prolonged incubation period led to
diminishing toxicity of nZVI on Collembola and Ostracods. Concentrations
of Fe(II) and Fe(III) were increased in the soil after addition of
nZVIs followed by incubation. Fe(II), particularly, was found to be
more toxic than nZVIs toward Ostracods. More studies are required
to optimize the effectiveness of nZVIs against DDT in different soil
categories and to assess their ecotoxicity with respect to severity
and impact period by covering a wide spectrum of soil biota.
