With the rapid development
of bio-based polymers, polybenzoxazine derived from renewable resources
has been widely investigated. However, there are few reports on the
functional application of bio-based polybenzoxazine based on the special
chemical structures of renewable compounds. In this work, an easy
approach to prepare the polybenzoxazines with varied thermomechanical
properties and excellent marine antifouling performance from renewable
resources is presented. After a variety of main-chain-type benzoxazine
polymers (MCBPs) were synthesized from the renewable daidzein, furfurylamine,
polyetheramine, and paraformaldehyde, their chemical structures were
identified by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and nuclear
magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR). Then, their curing
behaviors were monitored by differential scanning calorimetry and
rheological tests. Results revealed that the cross-linked MCBPs with
varied thermomechanical properties could be easily prepared by adjusting
the molar ratio of polyetheramine and furfuramine. Notably, these
cured MCBP films demonstrated excellent antibacterial and algaecidal
properties due to the presence of daidzein and furan units. This work
first presents the new application prospect of bio-based MCBPs, for
example, in marine antifouling coatings.

==== Body
Introduction
Polybenzoxazine, a
relatively new phenolic-type thermoset with
excellent properties, has attracted enormous interest from both academia
and industry.1,2 It is well known that the most
outstanding properties of polybenzoxazines stem from the Mannich bridges
[−CH2–N(R)–CH2−]
and hydrogen bonds.3−5 However, the existence of strong hydrogen bonding
restricts the movement of molecular chains, which in turn results
in the relatively low cross-linking density and high brittleness.6 To overcome this drawback, the molecular design
flexibility of benzoxazine monomers was fully utilized, and thus a
variety of main-chain-type benzoxazine polymers (MCBPs) that contain
repeated benzoxazine units in the main chain were developed.7−11 MCBPs not only perform like ordinary thermoplastics, which have
good processability, but also can form a three-dimensionally cross-linked
network via ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of the oxazine ring
in the main chain by heat treatment.

For the preparation of
most MCBPs, bisphenol A is usually used
as the starting material due to its abundant avaliabiltiy.7−10 However, the endocrine disruptor toxicity of bisphenol A has been
well ascertained,12 and the United States
as well as other developed countries have banned the usage of bisphenol
A in baby bottles.13 Therefore, it is highly
desirable to look for the healthy alternative to bisphenol A. In addition,
synthesis of polymers from renewable feedstock has received extensive
attention because of the increasing concern on petroleum resources
and environmental issues.14 Benzoxazine
resins are also on the same course and researchers have been making
efforts to replace the petroleum-based phenols and amines by the bio-based
ones.15 Up to now, varieties of benzoxazine
monomers have already been synthesized from the renewable sesamol,16 diphenolic acid,17 thymol,18 cardanol,19 lignin derivatives (guaiacol, vanillin, eugenol),20−26 coumaric,27,28 chavicol,29 umbelliferone,30 furfurylamine,31,32 stearylamine,33 and so on. However, compared
with the benzoxazine monomers derived from renewable feedstock, research
on bio-based MCBPs is seldom reported. Yagci et al. prepared a novel
bio-based MCBPs from coumarin, and the obtained polybenzoxazine demonstrated
satisfied thermal and mechanical properties.34 The eugenol-based MCBPs showing excellent processing performance
was also reported.35 What should be pointed
out here is that almost all the previous works are focused on the
thermal, mechanical, or processing properties of bio-based MCBPs.
Yet, there is little research on the unique chemical structure of
renewable compounds, which sometimes endows polymers with special
functionality.

Daidzein is a naturally occurring phenolic compound
that can be
isolated from soybeans and other legumes. Its derivatives have been
widely used in cosmetics, drugs, and food supplements with excellent
antioxidant and antimicrobial activities.37−39 Furfurylamine
is another well-known bio-based platform chemical that can be industrially
produced from agricultural byproducts. In addition, the furan ring
can provide additional cross-linking points for the benzoxazine, thereby
enhancing the performance of corresponding polybenzoxazines. More
importantly, furan and its analogues have been proven to have excellent
antifouling properties.40,41

Based on the
above information and analysis, besides the satisfied
thermal and mechanical properties, we expect to design and synthesize
MCBPs demonstrating some special functionalities, taking advantage
of the unique structure of bio-based compounds. Both the antibacterial
activity of daidzein39 and the antifouling
performance of furan analogues40,41 lead us to believe
that the incorporation of daidzein and furfurylamine units will give
polybenzoxazine some functional properties, for example, antibacterial
and algaecidal properties. Consequently, a series of MCBPs were synthesized
from the renewable daidzein, furfurylamine, polyetheramine, and paraformaldehyde
(Scheme 1). Also, furfurylamine
also acted as the monoamine to regulate the molecular weight of MCBPs.
The structure features, curing behaviors, and processability of these
oligomers as well as the properties of cured resins, including thermodynamic
properties, thermal stability, and antibacterial and anti-algae performance
were systemically investigated. In summary, besides thermal and mechanical
properties, the special functional properties of bio-based MCBPs caused
by the unique structure of bio-based compounds were concerned in this
work.

and Paraformaldehyde
Results and Discussion
Synthesis
and Characterization of MCBPs
MCBPs with
different compositions were synthesized from daidzein, amines (D-600
and furfurylamine), and formaldehyde. Their chemical structures were
determined by 1H NMR and FT-IR. As shown in Figure 1, the characteristic peaks
at 3.83 and 4.77 ppm corresponded to the Ph-CH2-N (H1-H4) and O-CH2-N (H1′-H4′)
protons in the oxazine ring. The furan ring was strongly suggested
by the signals at 6.0–6.5 ppm (H5, H6, H5′, H6′),
and their intensities displayed an increasing trend with the increase
of furfurylamine content in amines. Besides, the presence of a furfuryl
difunctional bisbenzoxazine monomer (Dz-f) was observed, as indicated
in Figure 1. Based
on the integrated area ratios of different peaks of Ph-CH2-N (H1-H4), the ratio of MCBPs to Dz-f varied from 1:0.09
to 1:0.51. Figure S1 shows the FT-IR spectra
of MCBPs. The absorbance peaks centered at 1233 and 914 cm–1 were assigned to C–O–C asymmetric stretching and C–H
out-of-plane bending in the benzene ring fused to the oxazine ring,
attesting to the formation of oxazine ring. The band at 1497 cm–1 was associated with the trisubstituted benzene ring.
The strong band at 1630 cm–1 was attributed to the
C=O attached to daidzein units.38 The successful incorporation of the furan ring was confirmed by
the bands at 1578 and 744 cm–1.42 In addition, the formation of MCBPs was also verified by
gel permeation chromatography (GPC) (Figure S2). In Table 1, the
number-average molecular weight (Mn) was
in the range of 1.8 × 103 to 5.5 × 103 g/mol, corresponding to a degree of polymerization (DP) of ∼2
to 6. As expected, the molecular weight increased with the reduction
of furfurylamine content in amines. Also, the obtained MCBPs all showed
narrow molecular weight distributions with a dispersity (Đ) of 1.2–2.1.

Curing Behaviors of MCBPs
Differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC) analysis was used to investigate the curing behaviors of obtained
MCBPs. As shown in Figure 2a, all the MCBPs exhibited similar DSC profiles with one exothermic
peak, which was related to the ROP of oxazine rings. Obviously, the
ROP temperature of these MCBPs polymers was relatively low. The reason
might be due to the existence of primary amine end groups in the molecular
chain, which could catalyze the curing reaction and then decrease
the starting curing temperature.43 After
more careful analysis, it was found that the peak temperature increased
slightly from 191.0 to 197.1 °C with the increasing content of
D-600 in amine mixtures, while the enthalpy value was decreased from
205.5 J/g for Dz-0.3d600-1.4f to 136.5 J/g for Dz-0.9d600-0.2f, which
might be associated with the dilution effect. As reported in previous
work,10,35,36 the lower
concentration of oxazine rings per unit weight would result in lower
polymerization reactivity and enthalpy. To have further insight into
the curing process, Dz-0.5d600-1.0f was taken as an example, and its
non-isothermal DSC thermograms at each curing stage are presented
in Figure 2b. It could
be seen that the exothermic enthalpy gradually decreased along with
the curing process, suggesting the increment in curing degree. Simultaneously,
the exothermic peak shifted to a higher temperature due to certain
structural rearrangement occurring and facilitating the diffusion-controlled
reaction at high temperature.44 After the
sample was cured at 200 °C for 2 h, the exothermic peak disappeared,
indicating the complete curing reaction. Therefore, the curing procedure
for MCBPs described in the Experimental Section could ensure the full polymerization.

the synthesized MCBPs; (b) DSC thermograms
of Dz-0.5d600-1.0f at each curing stage; (c) viscosity as a function
of temperature with the heating rate of 3 °C min–1; and (d) viscosity as a function of time at 150 °C.

Processability of MCBPs
In this work, all the MCBPs
were viscous liquids at room temperature, which is advantageous to
processing. To carefully evaluate the processability, dynamic viscosity
analysis was performed. As depicted in Figure 2c, the viscosity of all the MCBPs remained
low and fairly constant at the temperature range from 100 to 150 °C.
Meanwhile, when the temperature was over 150 °C, the viscosity
was observed to increase rapidly, indicating the gelation of MCBPs
at higher temperature. Usually, the maximum temperature at which the
viscosity was greatly increased up to 103 Pa·s was
taken as the gelation temperature of thermosetting resins.35 Thus, the gelation temperatures of Dz-0.9d600-0.2f,
Dz-0.7d600-0.6f, Dz-0.5d600-1.0f, and Dz-0.3d600-1.4f were determined
to be 167, 176, 175, and 176 °C, respectively.

The curing
reactivity of synthesized MCBPs was also evaluated during isothermal
curing at 150 °C. As shown in Figure 2d, the gel points for isothermal curing of
these bio-based MCBPs at 150 °C were observed after 12.8, 21.2,
28.2, and 37.6 min, respectively, which also indicated that the curing
reactivity of MCBPs increased gradually with the increasing content
of furfurylamine in amine mixtures. This was consistent with the above
DSC results.

Thermal and Mechanical Properties of Cross-Linked
MCBPs
Figure S2 shows the stress–strain
curves for all the cross-linked MCBPs, and the detailed data is collected
in Table 2. As depicted
in Figure S3a, when the ratio of D-600/furfurylamine
varied from 9:2 to 3:14, Young’s modulus was increased from
360 MPa for poly(Dz-0.9d600-0.2f) to 1620 MPa for poly(Dz-0.3d600-1.4f),
and the related tensile strength was increased from 16.3 to 54.7 MPa.
Meanwhile, their tensile strain at break decreased from 8.8 to 3.9%.
As for the flexural stress–strain curves shown in Figure S3b, the same trend was observed. It is
well known that a higher cross-linking density usually leads to an
increased strength, modulus, and brittleness. In this work, the end-capped
furan ring could participate in the polymerization and significantly
increase the cross-linking density and rigidity of resulted resins.30 As described in the Experimental
Section, the mole ratio between D-600 and furfurylamine could
be manipulated freely; therefore, the cross-linked MCBPs with varied
mechanical properties could be easily prepared.

The dynamic
mechanical properties of cross-linked MCBPs were evaluated
by DMA. The DMA curves are shown in Figure 3a,b, and the relevant data, including storage
modulus, Tg, and crosslinking density,
are collected in Table 3. As noticed, the storage moduli of cross-linked MCBPs at room temperature
were found to be in the range of 0.6–2.7 GPa. Also, the Tg values defined by the tan δ peak for poly(Dz-0.9d600-0.2f), poly(Dz-0.7d600-0.6f), poly(Dz-0.5d600-1.0f),
and poly(Dz-0.3d600-1.4f) were 92.9, 166.8, 212.8, and 268.5 °C,
respectively. Obviously, both the storage modulus and Tg were significantly increased with the increasing content
of furan moiety, which was mainly attributed to the formation of additional
cross-linking points caused by the reaction between the furan ring
and oxazine groups.45 Compared with literature
results, the Tg values of cross-linked
MCBPs in this work were much higher. For example, Ishida et al.10 synthesized several poly(ether diamine)-based
MCBPs showing excellent flexibility. However, even their highest Tg was lower than the room temperature.

c Cross-linking
density.

The cross-linking
density of a polymer is defined as the number
of cross-linking points per unit volume in the network. It could be
calculated using the following equation: 1  where E′ is the storage modulus
in the rubbery plateau region (E′ at the temperature
of 300 °C was chosen in this work), R is the
gas constant, and T is the 4absolute
temperature. The obtained νe values
are listed in Table 3, and they also increased with the furan moiety content in MCBPs,
which was in line with the above results.

The thermal stability
of cross-linked MCBPs was investigated by
TGA under N2 (Figure 3c) and air (Figure 3d) atmospheres. The temperature for 10% weight loss
(Td10%) and the residue at 800 °C
(R800) were selected for their thermal
stability evaluation. In Figure 3c, the Td10% was increased
from 366 °C for poly(Dz-0.9d600-0.2f) to 398 °C for poly(Dz-0.3d600-1.4f)
with the increasing content of furan moiety, much higher than those
of similar MCBPs reported in the literature.8,10,34 In addition, the R800 values were also increased accordingly, from 35.3 to 54.0%.
As for their thermal degradation in the air atmosphere (Figure 3d), the same trend was observed.
According to a previous study,38 the monomer-type
polybenzoxazine based on daidzein and furfurylamine also showed excellent
thermal stability both in nitrogen and air atmospheres. The reason
was attributed to the special benzopyrone structure of daidzein and
the presence of the furan moiety. In this work, the increasing thermal
stability of cross-linked MCBPs was also attributed to the fact that
the furan moiety could participate in the polymerization at high temperatures
and then increase the cross-linking density, which slows down the
degradation and promotes the char formation. In addition, the presence
of residual Dz-f monomers in different systems might be another reason
for the relatively higher Tg and better
thermal stability for the cured resins.

As we know, due to their intrinsic brittleness,
the static mechanical
properties of monomer-type polybenzoxazines, such as tensile strength
and modulus, are seldom reported. Also, the MCBPs, which contain repeated
benzoxazine units in the main chain, usually demonstrate higher toughness.
In order to further enhance the toughness of cured MCBPs, the long
flexible units are often incorporated. However, the long soft chain
will seriously sacrifice their thermal properties and mechanical strength.
Based on the literature survey,2,9,10 it was a proven fact that the cross-linked MCBPs usually show relatively
low Tg and strength, except the excellent
flexibility. Unlike the previously reported results, in this work,
the MCBPs based on daidzein and furfurylamine showed satisfied mechanical
and thermal properties as shown in Tables 2 and 3. Besides the
varied cross-linking density caused by the well-known crosslinking
reaction involved with the end-capped furan ring as well as the residual
Dz-f monomer, the daidzein unit, which could participate in the formation
of extra hydrogen bonding and then improve the performance of cured
resin, might be another reason for their good mechanical and thermal
properties.46

In order to study the
hydrogen bonding interactions in the cured
MCBPs in detail, poly(Dz-0.5d600-1.0f) was taken as an example and
the normalized FT-IR spectra at different temperatures (25 and 250
°C) were recorded for investigation (Figure 4a). As we know, the hydrogen bonds, such
as O–H···O, O–H···π,
O–H···N, and O–···H+N, generally exist in polybenzoxazine.47 Based on the literature, they could be divided into O–···H+N (∼2800 cm–1), O–H···N (∼3150 cm–1), O–H···O (∼3440 cm–1), and O∼H···π (∼3580
cm–1) intramolecular hydrogen bonding interaction
as well as O–H···O (∼3350 cm–1) and O–H···N (∼3300 cm–1) intermolecular hydrogen bonding for the sake of figuring out which
part of them made the main contribution to thermal performance.48 The splitting FT-IR spectra of poly(Dz-0.5d600-1.0f)
under 25 °C (Figure 4a, upper) and 250 °C (Figure 4a, lower) were displayed. It was clear that
the hydrogen bonding with different features possessed the uneven
ability of withstanding high temperature, especially for the intramolecular
O–H···π, which was completely disappeared
when the temperature was increased to 250 °C.

Figure 4 (a) Splitting FT-IR spectra

(b) comparison of split peaks’ integrated areas in Poly(Dz-0.5d600-1.0f)
at 25 and 250 °C; (c) idealized chemical structure of cured MCBPs.

The integrated areas of splitting peaks at different
temperatures
for poly(Dz-0.5d600-1.0f) were calculated, and their ratios are illustrated
in Figure 3b. As noticed,
when the temperature was increased to 250 °C, the intensity of
absorption bonds was decreased accordingly, which should be related
to the decreased hydrogen bonding strength. Other than the several
intramolecular hydrogen bonds with high strength retained more or
less, to our surprise, the generally weak intermolecular O–H···O
hydrogen bonding was majorly retained. As we know, hydrogen bonding
is a kind of electrostatic force; usually, the higher the negativity of the receptor, the higher the strength of the hydrogen bonding.49 In this work, one of the significant features
of the daidzein unit was that they contained an alkaline oxygen atom
with high negativity and a carbonyl group, which could not only increase
the probability of constructing more intermolecular O–H···O
hydrogen bonding but also enhance their strength and then increase
their durability at higher temperature. With these results and deductions,
for easy identification, we only put forward the intermolecular O–H···O
hydrogen bonding involved in daidzein units in Figure 4c (marked by red circles). Although it might
be a preliminary investigation on the hydrogen bonding interactions
here, the contribution of the hydrogen bonding involved in the alkaline
oxygen atom and carbonyl group in daidzein units to the satisfied
thermal and mechanical properties of cured MCBPs should not be ignored.
In the following work, more information about the formation and characteristic
of hydrogen bonding interactions in daidzein-based polybenzoxazines
will be provided.

Coating Performance of Cross-Linked MCBPs
Considering
the excellent film-forming and processing properties of MCBPs, it
has been extensively used for the preparation of solvent-free coatings.
The coating performances of cross-linked MCBPs in terms of adhesion,
pencil hardness, flexibility, and solvent resistance were investigated,
and the results are tabulated in Table 4. The adhesion of organic coatings is closely related
to its polar group content, which can significantly enhance the interaction
between the coatings and substrate.50 As
shown in Table 4, the
adhesion of all the cured MCBPs on tinplate was as high as 5B (the
highest level). That should be attributed to the presence of numerous
aromatic rings and phenolic hydroxyl groups in the cross-linked networks.51 The pencil hardness of coatings shows highly
correlation with their Tg. Higher Tg results in higher hardness values, from B
to 4H. In the contrary, the flexibility of these coatings was decreased
with the increasing Tg. When the D-600
content was 0.9–0.7, the flexibility of the film was 0T, which
was the highest grade of flexibility according to the ASTM D4145-10.
When the content of furan unit was increased to be higher than 0.6,
the rigidity and cross-linking density of cured networks were both
increased, which would lead to the decreased flexibility. The solvent
resistance of coatings is another important factor in determining
their end use. As could been seen from Table 4, all the coatings showed excellent solvent
resistance without any defect after 400 double rubs with ethanol and
methyl ethyl ketone.

Antibacterial Assay of Cross-Linked MCBPs
Marine biofouling
is a worldwide problem in marine systems. It is mainly caused by the
adhesion of barnacles, macroalgae, and microbial slimes. According
to the mainstream view of biofouling formation mechanism, preventing
the surface from colonization of bacteria is the key to inhabit the biofouling.52 Therefore, the suspension
assays were carried out by measuring both bacteria’s colonies
in solution with and without treatment to assess the bacterial killing
efficiency of cured MCBPs. Figure 5 shows the elimination ratio of both Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Bacillus
cereus ATCC6538 after contact with the cured MCBPs
films, and the images of these two bacterium colonies that survived
on the nutrient agar plates are exhibited in Figure S4. On the whole, the killing effect of these polybenzoxazine
films on E. coli was stronger than
that on B. cereus. The highest elimination
ratio of E. coli was 99.9%, and it
was 70.6% for B. cereus. Their different
cell wall structures should be responsible for this result. The toxicity
of the same antibacterial substance to different bacteria depends
on the degree of contact with the cells, and Gram-positive Bacillus species have a much thicker cell wall that could
prevent the passage of antibacterial substances through the cell wall.
Additionally, the elimination effect of these cured MCBP films on
the bacteria increased with the furan content. As the molar ratio
of D-600 to furfurylamine increased from 0.2 to 1.4, the elimination
ratio against the two bacteria increased from 27.1% (E. coli) and 31.2% (B. cereus) to 99.9% (E. coli) and 70.6% (B. cereus). This result indicated that it might be the functional groups,
such as the furan ring, responsible for the antifouling activities
of cured MCBP films. In fact, the intrinsic antifouling properties
of the furan ring and its derivatives have already attracted much
attention. For example, the halogenated furanones extracted from the
red alga Ahnfeltiopsis flabelliformis(53) and other furanones54 are typical quorum-sensing blockers. They are able to accelerate
the degradation of transcriptional activator LuxR and inhibit the
acylated homoserine lactone regulatory system of bacteria, resulting
in an inhibition of biofilm formation. Other furan analogues, including
14-hydroxycembra-1,3,7,11-tetraene, 15-hydroxycembra-1,3,7,11-tetraene,
13α-acetoxypukalide, and (9E)-4-(6,10-dimethylocta-9,11-dienyl)furan-2-carboxylic
acid also had excellent antibacterial activity.55,56 Of course, the other variable factor here, that is, the content
of D-600 moiety, might be another reason for the satisfied antifouling
property of cured films, which should be confirmed in the near future.

Anti-Algae Performance of Cured MCBPs
The settlement
behavior of algae like Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Navicula sp. on the surface of these bio-based
polybenzoxazine films was also studied. As shown in Figure 6, the confocal laser scanning
microscope photograph showed the distribution of fluorescence. The
state of the two diatoms on the surface of the silicon wafer and these
polybenzoxazine films was highly similar. However, the fluorescence
distribution on the surface of cured MCBPs films was diffused and
filled the whole view rather than being dense but having a strict
distinction from the background in the control group. This might be
due to the toxic effect of the polybenzoxazine films on the two algae
cells, which resulted in the breakage of the algae cells, causing
the chlorophyll efflux cells to be evenly distributed on the surface
of the samples. The SEM photos in Figure 6 demonstrated the above hypothesis. Large
amounts of algae with complete cell morphology attached to the surface
of the silicon wafer, and almost no algal cells with ruptured cell
morphology were observed. However, on the surface of the polybenzoxazine
films, algae cells showed a state of accumulation, with a large number
of flocculent cell debris around, indicating that these polybenzoxazine
films had a toxic effect on both algae and had good algae resistance.
As previously stated, the daidzein derivatives have shown excellent
antioxidant and antimicrobial activities when used as drugs and food
supplements.37,38 In this work, the amazing anti-algae
performance of cured MCBP films should also be attributed to the presence
of daidzein units.

Conclusions
A
variety of bio-based main-chain-type benzoxazine polymers (MCBPs)
were synthesized from the renewable daidzein, furfurylamine, polyetheramine,
and paraformaldehyde. Their microstructures were identified by FT-IR,
NMR, and GPC before the curing behaviors were investigated by DSC
and dynamic rheological analysis. Prior to the curing reaction, the
synthesized MCBPs showed excellent processability, and after heat
treatment, the cross-linked MCBPs exhibited varied thermal and mechanical
properties, depending on the molar ratio of polyetheramine and furfuramine.
Their Tg was in the range of 92.9–268.5
°C, their tensile strength varied from 16.3 to 54.7 MPa, and
their flexural strength ranged from 24.8 to 93.1 MPa. Some of them
were even higher than the monomer-type polybenzoxazines. These results
were totally different from the literature results where the cured
MCBPs usually showed relatively low Tg and strength, except the excellent flexibility. Notably, the MCBP-based
coatings demonstrated very good antibacterial properties and excellent
algae-killing ability, which had huge potential application in the
field of marine antifouling coatings, and the reason was attributed
to the unique structure of daidzein and furan units. In this work,
the functional application of polybenzoxazine based on the special
structures of renewable compounds was first demonstrated, which might
be a remarkable step toward the functionalization of bio-based materials,
besides the high thermal and mechanical properties.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Daidzein (98%) was obtained from SHANXI HAOCHEN
Bio-Technology Co., Ltd. Poly(propylene glycol) bis(2-aminopropyl
ether) (D-600, 98%), furfurylamine (99%), paraformaldehyde (96%),
and toluene (99%) were acquired from Aladdin Reagent, China. Petroleum
ether (60–90 °C) and methanol (99%) were purchased from
Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. All the chemicals were used as
received.

Synthesis of MCBPs
The synthesis of MCBPs was simply
illustrated in Scheme 1. Toluene (200 mL), a predetermined mixture of D-600 and furfurylamine
(the total amino group content of D-600 and furfurylamine was 1 mol
with varied molar ratio), and paraformaldehyde (2 mol) were added
into a 500 mL round-bottom flask and stirred at room temperature for
30 min. Then, 0.5 mol of daidzein dissolved in 50 mL of toluene was
added into the above mixture. After being heated at 90 °C for
12 h, the solution was cooled down to room temperature and concentrated
under reduced pressure. The obtained crude product was washed several
times with petroleum ether and then precipitated in methanol. Finally,
the residual solvent was evaporated under vacuum to yield the target
product. The nomination, feed composition, yield, and molecular weight
of resulting MCBPs are shown in Table 1.

Curing Procedure for MCBPs
The curing
reaction for
MCBPs was conducted in a stainless steel mold according to the following
procedure: MCBPs in a stainless steel mold were degassed under vacuum
oven at 100 °C for 20 min and then step-cured in a convection
oven for 2 h at 140 °C, 2 h at 160 °C, 2 h at 180 °C,
and 2 h at 200 °C. Once they were completely cured, the samples
were allowed to slowly cool to room temperature, and the brown films
were obtained. For coating performance evaluation, the degassed fluid
MCBPs were sprayed on polished tin plates to form a resin film with
a thickness of ∼50 μm. Then, the coatings were cured
according to the same curing procedures.

Measurements
Fourier
transform infrared spectra (FT-IR)
were acquired on a NICOLET 6700 (NICOLET, America) spectrometer at
room temperature. Samples were prepared by blending with KBr powder
and then being compressed into a pellet. The spectra were recorded
in the range of 400–4000 cm–1 with a resolution
of 4 cm–1. The chemical structure of MCBPs was verified
by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra recorded
on a 400 MHz AVANCE III Bruker NMR spectrometer (Bruker, Switzerland)
at 25 °C using CDCl3 as the solvent. The molecular
weight determination of MCBPs was conducted on an HLC-8320 (TOSOH
ECOSEC, Japan) gel permeation chromatography (GPC) system using monodisperse
polystyrene as the calibrant and THF as the eluent at a flow rate
of 1 mL/min. The curing behavior of MCBPs was analyzed by differential
scanning calorimetric (DSC) measurement conducted on a DSC (METTLER
TOLEDO, Switzerland) from 25 to 300 °C under a high-purity nitrogen
atmosphere at a flow rate of 20 mL/min. The thermal stability of cured
samples was evaluated with a Mettler-Toledo TGA/DSC1 (METTLER TOLEDO,
Switzerland) from 50 to 800 °C at a heating rate of 20 °C/min.
A universal mechanical testing machine (Instron 5569A) was used to
measure the tensile (100 mm × 8 mm × 0.5 mm) and flexural
(100 mm × 8 mm × 3 mm) properties with a crosshead speed
of 10 and 2 mm min–1. Five tests were carried out
for each sample.

Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) was performed
on a TA Instrument (TA Q800, USA) in tension mode with a heating rate
of 3 °C/min in the temperature range of 25 to 350 °C using
a frequency of 1 Hz. The dimensions were 20 mm × 5 mm ×
0.5 mm, and the amplitude was set as 10 mm. To evaluate the melt processability
of MCBPs, a dynamic rheological analyzer (Anton Paar Physica MCR-301,
Austria) was utilized. The test was performed between parallel plates
in steady shear mode with a heating rate of 3 °C/min and shear
rate of 1 s–1. The pencil hardness was evaluated
using a pencil hardness tester (Tianjin Kexin Test machinery factory,
China) according to ASTM D3363-00. The flexibility of the film was
measured according to ASTM D4145-10. The adhesion was determined by
a crosshatch adhesion method according to ASTM D3359-09. The solvent
resistance of coating films was determined by the double rub method
according to the ASTM D5402-06. These films were wiped with a cotton
gauze using ethanol or methyl ethyl ketone as the solvent. The results
were reported as the minimum number of double rubs at which a significant
change on the surfaces was observed or it was reported as “>400”
if no change was observed after 400 double rubs, which was the maximum
number of double rubs in the test. The antifouling property of cured
films was assessed by examining the formation of a bacterial biofilm
and settlements of algae on their surfaces. E. coli (ATCC 25922, Gram-negative) and B. cereus (ATCC6538, Gram-positive) were chosen as the model bacteria (ASTME2149-01):
the bacterium was incubated in a fluid medium (0.5 wt % yeast extract
powder, 1 wt % fish meal peptone, 1 wt % NaCl) with a shake speed
of 120 rpm at 30 °C for 24 h. Then, the bacteria-containing medium
was centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 10 min. After the supernatant was
removed and washed three times with sterile 9 wt % saline solution,
the concentration of bacterium solution was determined using a microplate
reader (SpectraMax 190, Molecular Devices) until an OD 600 of 0.1
A (108 CFU/mL) was reached. Further appropriate dilution
with the sterile 9 wt % saline solution led to a final concentration
of 105 CFU/mL. Each film was added into a flask, which
contains 50 mL of bacterium solution with the concentration of 105 CFU/mL, and was placed on a shaker at 37 °C (120 rpm).
After cultivation for 36 h, 100 μL of solution was extracted
and diluted (10–1, 10–2) and 100
μL of diluted solution was placed on nutrient agar plates in
triplicate and incubated at 37 °C
for 24 h. The number of bacterial colonies on each plate was counted.
The killing ratio (R) was calculated by R = (N0 – Nt)/N0 × 100%. N0 and Nt are the bacterium
concentrations of control and experiments, respectively. Diatoms P. tricornutum (NMBguh001, from Ningbo University,
China) and Navicula sp. (NMBguh006–8, from
Ningbo University, China) were selected to further investigate the
antifouling performances. The diatoms were cultured in sea water until
the concentration was close to 105 cells/mL. The MCBP films
were incubated in a biochemical incubator with the above diatom suspension.
Adhesion of algae on the surface of MCBP films for 24 h was performed,
and then they were observed using a 3100v laser scanning confocal
microscope (LSCM, TCS SP5, Leica, Germany) analysis system and a scanning
electron microscope (SEM, EVO18, ZEISS, Germany). Each sample was
randomly selected at 10 fields of vision, and the amount of attached
algae was calculated. At least three experiments were repeated for
each sample.
