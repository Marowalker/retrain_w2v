Reactions of two dinaphthyl
phosphines
with [Cp*IrCl2]2 have been carried out. In the
case of di(α-naphthyl)phenylphosphine
(1a), a simple P-coordinated neutral adduct 2a is obtained. However, tert-butyldi(α-naphthyl)phenylphosphine
(1b) is cyclometalated to form [Cp*IrCl(P^C)] (3b). Complexes 2a and 3a undergo
further cyclometalation to give the corresponding double cyclometalated
complexes [Cp*Ir(C^P^C)] (4a,b) upon heating.
In the presence of sodium acetate, reactions of 1a,b with [Cp*IrCl2]2 directly afford the
final double cyclometalated complexes (4a,b). In the absence of acetate, [Cp*RhCl2]2 shows
no reaction with 1a,b, whereas with acetate
the reactions form the corresponding single cyclometalated complexes
[Cp*RhCl(P^C)] (5a,b), which react with tBuOK to form the corresponding rhodium hydride
complexes (6a,b). Treatment of 4a with CuCl2 or I2 leads to opening of two Ir–C
σ bonds to yield the corresponding P-coordinated iridium dihalide
(7 or 8) by means of an intramolecular C–C
coupling reaction. A new chiral phosphine (11) is formed
by the ligand-exchange reaction of 8 with PMe3. Reactions of the single cycloiridated complex 3b with
terminal aromatic alkynes result in the corresponding five- and six-membered
doubly cycloiridated complex 12 and/or η2-alkene coordinated complexes 13–15; the latter
discloses that the electronic effect of terminal alkynes affects the
regioselectivity. While the single cyclorhodated complex 5b reacts with terminal aromatic alkynes to form the corresponding
six-membered cyclometalated complexes 16a–c by
vinylidene rearrangement/1,1-insertion. Plausible pathways for formation
of insertion products 13–16 were proposed. Molecular
structures of twelve new complexes were determined by X-ray diffraction.

Introduction
To date, cyclometalation
reactions are the most actively investigated
reactions in the field of organometallic chemistry, which have been
carried out with the most transition metal compounds, especially platinum
group metal complexes.1 In the last 2 decades,
especially after Davies et al. developed an efficient acetate-assisted
cyclometalation of some N-donor ligands with [Cp*MCl2]2 (M = Rh and Ir) and [(p-cymene)RuCl2]2,2 a significant number
of N-containing functional arene or heteroarene derivatives were cyclometalated
by [Cp*RhCl2]2, especially by [Cp*IrCl2]2, such as benzylamine,2−6 imine,2b,7−12 2-phenylpyridine,2a,8−14 2-benzylpyridine,11 2-benzoylpyridine,15,16 2-phenylpyrroline,17 2-phenylpyrrolidine,17 phenylpyrazole,8,10,15,18 benzo[h]quinoline,8,10,12 oxazoline,2b,8,10,15 oxazolone,19 oxime,15 imidazole,15 and
trizole.15 Later on, Jones et al. investigated
the reactivity and regioselectivity of cyclometalation reactions of
substituted phenyl imines and 2-phenylpyridines with [Cp*MCl2]2, including electronic and steric effects of substituted
groups and solvent and temperature effects.11 Most cyclometalation reactions with above N-donor ligands produce
intramolecular-coordination five-membered ring compounds, and only
few of them afford six-membered ring products.11,15,16 To date, there is less study on phosphine
ligands involved cyclometalation with [Cp*MCl2]2 (M = Rh and Ir)20−24 when compared to that of N-containing ligands. Recently, we reported
the cyclometalation of phosphines and phosphinites with [Cp*MCl2]2 (M = Rh and Ir)25 and [(p-cymene)RuCl2]226 in methanol in the presence of sodium acetate,
and the resulting five-membered cyclometalated products showed interesting
and diverse chemical reactivity. To increase the diversity of donor
ligands and further understand the reactivity of cyclometalated products,
herein we report an investigation of cyclometalation of two dinaphthyl
phosphine ligands with [Cp*MCl2]2 (M = Rh and
Ir) and discuss the structures and reactivity of the resulting single
and double cyclometalated complexes.

Results and Discussion
Reaction
of [Cp*IrCl2]2 with Di(α-naphthyl)phenylphosphine
(1a) or tert-Butyldi(α-naphthyl)phenylphosphine
(1b)
Compounds 1a and 1b were chosen as ligands for two reasons: first, two α-naphthyl
groups could provide two C(sp2)–H bonds at the appropriate
positions for potential C–H bond activation by the metal center;
and second, phenyl and tert-butyl groups represent
two typical groups with different steric effects, which might lead
to different reactivity. By analogy to our previous work with similar
substrates,25 phosphine 1a was reacted with [Cp*IrCl2]2 in methanol at
room temperature, producing the corresponding phosphine-substituted
iridium dichloride 2a in good yield (Scheme 1). The similar complex Cp*Ir(PPh3)Cl2 has been reported as early as 1969,27 which was synthesized similarly by [Cp*IrCl2]2 and PPh3 in hot ethanol. However,
when phosphine 1b reacted with [Cp*IrCl2]2 under the same conditions, a five-membered cyclometalated
complex 3b was formed. Obviously, the formation of complexes 3b goes through an intramolecular activation of the C(sp2)–H bond on the adjacent α position of naphthyl
ring. Davies et al. have concluded that hydrogen bonding between the
C–H bond and acetate are two key factors for successful cyclometalation,2a and here we consider that larger steric demand
of phosphine ligand 1b may also contribute to the implementation
of cyclometalation, because cyclometalation could relieve the strain
in the molecular structure. Thus, in the absence of acetate, the cyclometalation
reaction still occurred in this case. When the above two reactions
were carried out under heating conditions, the final products 4a,b were obtained, which contain two five-membered
metalated rings in their respective structures. Apparently, two C(sp2)–H bonds from two naphthyl rings were activated by
the metal center; 2a is red solid, 3b is
orange solid, and 4a,b are light yellow
solid. All of them were fully characterized by spectroscopic analysis,
in which the structures of 2a and 4a were
confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis.

Scheme 1 Reaction of [Cp*IrCl2]2 with Di(α-naphthyl)phenylphosphine
(1a) or tert-Butyldi(α-naphthyl)phenylphosphine
(1b)
The structure of 2a is shown in Figure 1, which reveals a
classic three-legged piano
stool geometry with the iridium(III) center coordinated by a η5 Cp*, one phosphorus atom P(1), and two chlorine atoms Cl(1)
and Cl(2). The Ir(1)–P(1) bond distance [2.349(3) Å] is
slightly longer than that [2.324(3) Å] in Cp*IrCl2(PPh3),28 which is probably
due to the larger steric bulk of di(α-naphthyl)phenylphosphine
compared to that of PPh3.

Selected bond lengths [Å] and angles [°] are Ir(1)–P(1)
2.349(3), Ir(1)–Cl(1) 2.417(3), Ir(1)–Cl(2) 2.407(3),

85.86(9), ∠Cl(1)–Ir(1)–P(1) 92.55(9), and ∠Cl(2)–Ir(1)–P(1)
89.53(9).

The structure of 4a is shown in Figure 2, the dinaphthylphenylphosphine is acting
as a tridentate ligand, which is coordinated to the iridium(III) center
through one phosphorus atom P(1) and two metalated carbon atoms C(11)
and C(21), both come from naphthyl groups. Two five-membered rings
fused together sharing two adjacent atoms Ir(1) and P(1), which constitute
the main molecular framework. Either five atoms constituting Ir(1)–C(11)–C(12)–C(13)–P(1)
ring or five atoms constituting Ir(1)–C(21)–C(22)–C(23)–P(1)
ring are not exactly in the same plane, especially for the latter
five ones. The Ir(1)–P(1) bond distance [2.2232(11) Å]
is significantly shorter than that [2.349(3) Å] in 2a, which indicates that cyclometalation would help ease the strain
in the molecular structure. Carmona has reported a structurally similar
iridium complex Cp*Ir[PMe(η1-Xyl)2],20c the formation of which went through intramolecular
activation of two C(sp3)–H bonds. Its Ir–P
bond distance is 2.205(2) Å, consistent with the value in 4a.

Davies et al. have reported that
acetate could assist C–H
bond activation and promote the cyclometalation in the reactions of
2-substituted pyridines with [Cp*MCl2]2 (M =
Ir, Rh).2a For comparison, similar reactions
of [Cp*IrCl2]2 with phosphines 1a,b in the presence of sodium acetate were performed
at room temperature, which resulted in corresponding doubly five-membered
cyclometalated complexes 4a,b in good yields
(Scheme 2). It is quite
clear that acetate also promotes the cyclometalation in our cases.
The use of iridium complex [Cp*IrCl2]2 as precursor
in cyclometalation reactions with a large variety of nitrogen-containing
and phosphine ligands has been widely reported, however, the similar
cyclometalation reactions based on two C–H bonds activation
from one phosphine ligand are rarely studied. A closely related reaction
was performed by Carmona et al., who found that bis(aryl) phosphine
PMe(Xyl)2(Xyl = 2,6-Me2C6H3) could be cycloiridated by [Cp*IrCl2]2 in
the presence of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine to give the complex
Cp*IrCl[PMe(Xyl)(η1-Xyl)],20c and it was further treated with an excess of NaOMe in a 1:1 solvent
mixture of MeOH and CHCl3 to afford the doubly metalated
complex Cp*Ir[PMe(η1-Xyl)2]. In our cases
of di(α-naphthyl)phosphine (1a,b),
the double metalated complexes 4a,b were
directly produced from one-pot reactions. Activation of the aromatic
C(sp2)–H bond in our cases may account for the ease
of the double cyclometalation reaction compared to C(sp3)–H bond activation in the case of phosphine PMe(Xyl)2.

Scheme 2 Reactions of [Cp*IrCl2]2 with 1a,b in the Presence of NaOAc
Reaction of [Cp*RhCl2]2 with 1a or 1b
For comparison, reactions of phosphines 1a,b and [Cp*RhCl2]2 have
been carried out in methanol; however, neither C–H activation
product nor simple phosphine coordination product was observed even
at elevated temperatures. The decreased reactivity of rhodium compared
to iridium indicates that the former is less electrophilic, a similar
argument has been made by Jones in discussion of the reactions of
[Cp*MCl2]2 (M = Ir and Rh) with 2-benzylpyridine.11 When the same reactions were performed in the
presence of sodium acetate, the corresponding five-membered cyclometalated
rhodium complexes 5a,b were successfully
produced (Scheme 3).
It is worth noting that above reactions did not give the doubly metalated
products even under heating conditions, which are different with the
cases of iridium. We considered that doubly metalated rhodium compounds
may not be the thermodynamically stable products, contrary to the
iridium analogues 4a,b. To obtain the doubly
metalated rhodium compounds, a reaction of 5a or 5b with an excess of tBuOK in
methanol was carried out at room temperature; however, no expected
doubly metalated product was observed, but a light-yellow solid was
precipitated in the bottom of flask. The solvent methanol was carefully
removed and replaced with C6D6 for further NMR
characterization. In the 1H NMR spectra of 6a,b, a distinct triplet at high field (δ −12.09
ppm for 6a and −12.72 ppm for 6b)
was observed indicating the existence of Rh–H proton. Combined
with other NMR spectra analysis, 6a,b were
assigned as the cyclometalated rhodium hydride (Scheme 3). When above reactions were performed in
CD3OD, the corresponding products 6a-d1 and 6b-d1 were obtained. It is very clear that the hydride ligand in 6a or 6b comes from methanol. A similar Cl/D
exchange reaction was observed in the reaction of Cp*IrCl[PMe(Xyl)(η1-Xyl)] with NaOCD3.20a In the process of purification of 6a,b by column chromatography in air, serious decomposition was observed.
Besides, we also tried the reaction of 5a with nBuLi or MeLi in THF for further cyclometalation;
however, no product was obtained except the starting material 5a.

Scheme 3 Reactions of [Cp*RhCl2]2 with 1a,b
Complexes 4a,b are structurally novel products, iridium(III)
center is coordinated by one phosphorus atom and two sp2 hybridized carbon atoms, and two fused five-membered rings constitute
the main molecular framework. We are curious about the chemical reactivity
of this type of complexes. To develop a general understanding of the
reactivity of the complexes containing two metalated five-membered
rings, we have chosen 4a as a representative and explored
the reactions of 4a with anhydrous CuCl2,
and I2.

Reaction of 4a with CuCl2
Anhydrous
CuCl2 is a well-known oxidant, which is generally used
for inducing oxidative coupling in organometallic reactions. Jones
et al. have reported the insertion reactions of dimethylacetylenedicarboxylate
with cyclometalated rhodium compounds, and then, the demetallization
of the insertion compounds was achieved by oxidative coupling with
CuCl2 to form the novel isoquinoline salts.12 Here, a similar treatment of 4a with 2 equiv of anhydrous CuCl2 in CH2Cl2 at room temperature was performed, which produced the phosphine-substituted
iridium dichloride 7 (Scheme 4). Obviously, oxidative coupling of two metal-bound
naphthyl groups occurred in the presence of CuCl2 to form
a binaphthyl unit, which was accompanied by the opening of two five-membered
metallacycles. However, the phosphorus atom is still coordinated to
metal center, which may due to the strong bonding between metal and
phosphine ligand. When the same reaction was performed on 4a with only 1 equiv of CuCl2, a mixture of the starting
complex 4a and the product 7 was obtained,
indicating that a full 2 equiv of CuCl2 is required to
complete the oxidative-coupling reaction. A plausible pathway was
proposed in Scheme 5 to show how 2 equiv of CuCl2 is required in the reaction.
Complex 4a was also treated with excess Cu(OAc)2, but no reaction was observed at room temperature. Complex 7 was fully characterized by spectroscopic analysis, and its
structure was further confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis.

Scheme 4 Reaction of 4a with CuCl2
Scheme 5 Plausible Pathway for Formation of 7
The structure of 7 is shown in Figure 3, which reveals a classic three-legged piano
stool geometry with the iridium(III) center coordinated by a η5 Cp*, one phosphorus atom P(1), and two chlorine atoms Cl(1)
and Cl(2). It is noteworthy that two naphthyl groups from phosphine
ligand are bonded by two adjacent α carbon atoms to constitute
a seven-membered ring. The Ir(1)–P(1) bond distance is 2.3159(12)
Å, which is in good agreement with the value [2.324(3) Å]
in Cp*IrCl2(PPh3),28 and slightly shorter than that [2.349(3) Å] in 2a, which is probably due to the less steric bulk of two bonded naphthyl
groups compared to two normal naphthyl ones. The C(19)–C(21)
bond distance is 1.494(6) Å, close to the normal value of C–C
single bond, which means the absence of conjugation between two naphthyl
rings.

98.95(19).

Reaction of 4a with I2
It is
well-known that the M–C σ bond of the cyclometalated
complex readily undergoes the oxidative addition of I2 to
give the ring-opening product.29 Treatment
of 4a with an excess of I2 in CH2Cl2 afforded the phosphine-substituted iridium diiodide 8, the analogue of 7 (Scheme 6). Generally speaking, oxidative addition
of I2 on one Ir–C σ bond would lead to the
opening of a five-membered ring to yield the iridium iodide adduct;
a similar addition reaction of the five-membered cyclometalated rhenium
amine complex with I2 has been reported by Lu,29 and thus, addition of I2 on two Ir–C
bonds should similarly give the expected product 9 (Scheme 6). However, compound 9 has never been observed either by TLC monitoring or by column
chromatography. We considered that the final product 8 was generated from the further cross-coupling of two iodonaphthalene
units of the intermediate 9. The crystal structure of 8 is provided in the Supporting Information, which exhibits structure similar to that of 7.

Scheme 6 Reaction of 4a with I2
New Type of Chiral Phosphine Formed by the
Ligand-Exchange Reaction
The phosphine-substituted iridium
diiodide 8 readily
underwent the ligand-exchange reaction in the presence of excess PMe3 in toluene at room temperature to free a new phosphine 11, as well as PMe3-substituted iridium diiodide 10 (Scheme 7). Compound 11 is an air-stable white solid. The structure
of 11 is shown in Figure 4, which is assigned as S configuration.
Structures of two naphthyl rings are not standard, because 10 carbon
atoms of each one are not exactly in the same plane. The dihedral
angle between two bonded six-membered rings is 43.7°, so there
should be no distinct conjugation between two naphthyl rings. This
is also supported by the long C(9)–C(11) bond distance [1.516(3)
Å], which is quite close to the value of normal C–C single
bond (1.54 Å). This chiral phosphine is first reported, which
may have potential application as ligands for construction of a chiral
catalyst or as an additive in stereoselective catalytic reactions.

∠C(13)–P(1)–C(21) 100.76(10).

Scheme 7 Reaction of 8 with PMe3
Recently, we reported a series
of results concentrated on the alkyne-insertion
reactions into M–C bonds (M = Ir, Rh, or Ru) of five- and six-membered
N- or P-containing cyclometalated complexes. We observed different
alkyne-insertion modes, including 1,2-insertion and 1,1-insertion
after the initial vinylidene rearrangement.25 Hence, considering the interest of some of us in the reactivity
of alkyne-insertion for different metals, different ligands, or different
ring sizes, and the complementary research of others on understanding
the features and patterns of insertion reaction, here we investigated
the reactions of doubly cyclometalated complexes 4a,b with aromatic alkynes, like diphenylacetylene or phenylacetylene;
however, no product was obtained. A reasonable explanation for this
result is that the metal center in 4a or 4b is coordinately saturated and relatively crowded, and there is no
free space for acetylene approaching and subsequent coordination.

To compare the results we obtained recently,25 we similarly performed the reactions of terminal aryl acetylenes
with five-membered cycloiridated and cyclorhodated phosphine complexes
(3b and 5b). First, the reaction of 3b with PhC≡CH in methanol at room temperature was
carried out, which, unfortunately, did not afford any characterizable
products. Then, two substituted phenylacetylenes were tested under
the same conditions instead of phenylacetylene. In the case of p-FC6H4C≡CH, the reaction yielded
the expected five- and six-membered doubly cyclometalated complexes 12 (Scheme 8), which is similar to the one obtained from the reaction of PhC≡CH
with the five-membered cycloiridated complex Cp*IrClPPh2(η1-C10H6) in our previous
work,25 so we consider that the plausible
pathway for the formation of 12 is also similar to that
we have proposed before. It is interesting to note that the reaction
also afforded the other unexpected product 13, the η2-alkene coordinated complex.

Scheme 8 Reaction of 3b with p-FC6H4C≡CH
While in the case of p-MeOC6H4C≡CH, the reaction
resulted in the only product 14 (Scheme 9), which
is similar to 13, but the regioselectivity of alkyne
insertion is opposite to that in 13. Complexes 12–14 were fully characterized by spectroscopic analysis,
and the structures of 12 and 14 were further
confirmed by X-ray crystallography. Although complex 13 did not form crystal of high quality that is suitable for X-ray
diffraction, its structure was supported by the consistent 1H NMR data with the anion-exchanged complex 15c described
below, whose structure was determined by X-ray diffraction.

Scheme 9 Reaction
of 3b with p-MeOC6H4C≡CH
The structure of 12 is shown in Figure 5 with selected bond lengths and angles, which
shows that the iridium(III) center is coordinated by a η5 Cp*, one phosphorus atom P(1), and two metalated carbon atoms
C(35) and C(38), which come from phenylacetylene. Two fused rings
constitute the molecular framework: one is a five-membered ring, and
the other is a six-membered one; they share two adjacent atoms Ir(1)
and C(35). For the five-membered ring, all five atoms in the ring
are almost in the same plane. The corresponding bond lengths and angles
in 12 are almost equal to those of its analogue obtained
from the phenylacetylene insertion reaction of the five-membered cycloiridated
complex Cp*IrClPPh2(η1-C10H6) in our previous work.25

The structure of 14 is shown in Figure 6 with selected bond lengths and angles. The
iridium cationic center is coordinated by a η5 Cp*,
a η2 C=C double bond, one phosphorus atom
P(1), and one metalated carbon atoms C(36). The five-membered ring
(Ir(1)–P(1)–C(34)–C(35)–C(36)) adopts
a nonplanar “puckered” conformation. The Ir(1)–C(36)
bond distance is 2.077(12) Å, which is shorter than two almost
equal length ones [2.204(12) and 2.208(10) Å] in Ir(1)(η2-(C(18)=C(19))) unit and also shorter than those [2.269(4)
and 2.281(5) Å] in double five-membered cycloiridated complex 4a. The Ir(1)–P(1) bond distance [2.286(3) Å]
is shorter that [2.349(3) Å] in Cp*IrCl2PPh(Naph)2 (2a) but longer than that [2.2232(11) Å]
in 4a. The η2-coordinated disubstituted
alkene adopts a stable cis configuration, which might be ascribed
to the steric factor.

Recently, some alkyne insertion
reactions of five-membered cycloiridated
complexes were studied in the presence of NaBArF4, which presented 1,2-insertion mode or 1,1-insertion mode after
the initial vinylidene rearrangement.30 Thus, we have further investigated the reactivity of 3b with terminal aryl acetylenes and NaBArF4.
When a mixture of 3b with p-RC6H4C≡CH (R = H, MeO, or F) and NaBArF4 in CH2Cl2 was stirred at room
temperature for 30 min, a yellow-green crystal was obtained by recrystallization.
X-ray diffraction studies disclosed the structures of 15a–c (Scheme 10). For
PhC≡CH or p-MeOC6H4C≡CH,
similar products (15a,b) were obtained with
the same regioselectivity of alkyne insertion; however, for p-FC6H4C≡CH, the product 15c was formed with the opposite regioselectivity of alkyne
insertion. The 1H NMR spectra of 15b and 15c show the consistent peaks with those of 14 and 13, respectively, except the extra peaks for the
protons on BArF4 anion. The X-ray structure
of 15c is depicted in Figure 7, and the crystal structures and crystallographic
data for 15a and 15b are provided in the Supporting Information.

Scheme 10 Reaction of 3b with p-RC6H4C≡CH (R = H, MeO, or
F) in the Presence of NaBArF4
In the structure of 15c, the iridium
cationic center
is coordinated by a η5 Cp*, a η2 C=C double bond, one phosphorus atom P(1), and one metalated
carbon atoms C(11). The Ir(1)–C(11) bond distance is 2.139(8)
Å, slightly longer than the similar Ir(1)–C(36) bond distance
[2.077(12) Å] in 14. Unlike those in 14, Ir(1)–C(35) and Ir(1)–C(42) bond distances [2.289(9)
and 2.121(9) Å] in Ir(1)(η2-(C(35)=C(42)))
unit are not even, which might be due to the different steric effect
on two carbon atoms, C(42) is bonded with two H atoms, whereas C(35)
is bonded with two bulky aromatic groups. The Ir(1)–P(1) bond
distance [2.288(2) Å] is almost equal to that [2.286(3) Å]
in 14.

By careful analysis of the crystal structures
of 13–15, we proposed a plausible pathway for
the formation of them in Scheme 11. First, the chloride
of 3b dissociates to free up a coordinate space for aromatic
alkyne and then generate a η2-alkyne complex B, which undergoes 1,2-alkyne insertion to give the seven-membered
metallacycle C or C′. The most noteworthy
thing is the different regioselectivity of the alkyne insertion in
this step. For the simple phenylacetylene or the arylacetylene containing
an electron-donating substituent (p-OMe), the aryl
group is found on the carbon atom adjacent to the metal iridium in C, and the regioselectivity is the same as that found by Jin
in the reaction of PhC≡CH with the similar five-membered cycloiridated
aryl imine complex,31 also the same as
that reported by Davies in the reaction of PhC≡CH with the
five-membered cycloiridated phenylpyrazole or imine complex.32 For the arylacetylene containing an electron-withdraw
substituent (p-F), the terminal carbon atom is bonded
to the metal in C′, and the regioselectivity similar
to this case was rarely observed. The above results indicate the dominance
of electronic effects on the regioselectivity. Subsequently, this
is followed by an intramolecular activation of the C–H bond
on the adjacent α position of the other naphthyl ring to build
a new five-membered metallacycle (D or D′). In the last step, reductive reduction occurs to give a disubstituted
alkene, which subsequently coordinates to the metal center in η2 mode and affords the final products 15a,b or 15c. Apparently, 1,2-alkyne insertion into
the Ir–C(naphthyl) bond was more favored in these reactions
than vinylidene rearrangement of alkyne, while the opposite preference
was observed in the reaction of PhC≡CH with the five-membered
cycloiridated complex Cp*IrClPPh2(η1-C10H6) in our previous work,25 we considered that an appropriate and activable C–H bond
provided by the other naphthyl group on phosphine ligand is crucial.

Scheme 11 Plausible Pathway for the Formation of 15a–c (Anion
Cl– or BArF4– is Omitted for Clarity)
Finally, we have studied the reactions of terminal aryl
acetylenes
with five-membered cyclorhodated phosphine complex (5b). When a mixture of 5b with p-RC6H4C≡CH (R = H, MeO, or F) in methanol was
stirred at room temperature for 1–2 h, the corresponding red
crystals 16a–c were obtained by recrystallization
(Scheme 12). X-ray
diffraction studies disclosed the structures of 16b,c, which are the six-membered cyclorhodated phosphine complexes,
so the formation of 16a–c should occur through
the initial vinylidene rearrangement to the corresponding phenylvinylidene
intermediate followed by the 1,1-insertion of vinylidene ligand into
the Rh–C(naphthyl) bond and Cl recoordination to metal center.
It is noteworthy that products 16a–c did not undergo
the further intramolecular activation of the C–H bond on the
α position of the other naphthyl group to build the second metallacycle.
Besides, this result is also different with the reaction of the similar
five-membered cyclorhodated phosphine complex Cp*RhClPPh2(η1-C10H6) with PhC≡CH,25 which mainly produced the corresponding seven-membered
cyclometalated complex by means of 1,2-alkyne insertion. This difference
shows that the substituents on phosphine may affect the alkyne insertion
modes.

Scheme 12 Reaction of 5b with p-RC6H4C≡CH (R = H, MeO, or F)
The X-ray structure of 16b is depicted
in Figure 8, which
shows that
the rhodium(III) center is coordinated by a η5 Cp*,
one phosphorus atom P(1), one chlorine atom Cl(1), and one carbon
atom C(21), which come from p-MeOC6H4C≡CH. For the six-membered ring Rh(1)–P(1)–C(12)–C(11)–C(20)–C(21),
the five nonmetal atoms are almost in one plane, whereas the metal
atom Rh(1) is 1.2797 Å away from the plane. The bond lengths
Rh(1)–P(1), Rh(1)–Cl(1), and Rh(1)–C(21) [2.2941(11),
2.4183(11), and 2.064(4) Å] are in good agreement with those
[2.2776(7), 2.4007(7), and 2.079(2) Å] in a five-membered cyclorhodated
phosphine analogue Cp*RhClPiPr2(η1-Xyl) reported by Carmona.20d Two aryl groups on alkene C(21)=C(22) unit adopt
a cis configuration, which is reflected by the minor
torsion angle [∠C(20)–C(21)–C(22)–C(23)
−9.4(7)°]. The crystal structure of 16c is
similar to that of 16b, and the crystallographic data
of 16c is provided in the Supporting Information.

Conclusions
[Cp*IrCl2]2 and [Cp*RhCl2]2 show different
cyclometalation reactivity with dinaphthyl
phosphines (1a,b). For the former, the reactions
give the corresponding double cyclometalated complexes [Cp*Ir(C^P^C)]
(4a,b), while for the latter, the reactions
afford the single cyclometalated complexes [Cp*RhCl(P^C)] (5a,b). An intramolecular C–C coupling reaction
in 4a is induced by CuCl2 or I2 to form the simple P-coordinated iridium dihalide (7 or 8). The double cyclometalated complexes 4a,b show no reaction with terminal or internal aromatic
alkynes, whereas the single cyclometalated complexes 3b and 5b present novel and different reactivity with
terminal aromatic alkynes. For the former, competition between vinylidene
rearrangement/1,1-insertion and 1,2-alkyne insertion into the Ir–C
is observed with p-FC6H4C≡CH;
an appropriate C–H bond provided by the other naphthyl ring
could be readily activated by metal center, which may contribute to
the pathway of 1,2-alkyne insertion, because we did not observed the
similar process in the reaction of the single cycloiridated complex
Cp*IrClPPh2(η1-C10H6) with PhC≡CH or PhC≡CPh.25 In the presence of NaBArF4, only η2-alkene coordinated complexes 15a–c are
obtained by means of 1,2-alkyne insertion followed by the further
intramolecular transformation. The regioselectivity of insertion of
alkynes with different electronic effects has also been tentatively
studied, and the regioselectivity was found to depend on the exact
alkyne used; terminal alkyne with electron-rich aromatic ring favored
insertion with the aromatic ring next to the meal, whereas terminal
alkyne with electron-poor aromatic ring favored insertion with the
aromatic ring next to the naphthyl phosphine. For the cyclometalated
rhodium complex 5b, the six-membered cyclometalated complexes 16a–c are formed by vinylidene rearrangement/1,1-insertion.
In summary, these results show that both the activity of transition
metals and steric and electronic effect of substituents on phosphine
would affect the alkyne insertion modes and the subsequent structural
transformation.

Experimental Section
General Considerations
All reactions were carried out
under nitrogen using standard Schlenk and vacuum line techniques;
however, the workup was carried out in air unless stated otherwise.
All solvents were distilled from appropriate drying agents under nitrogen
prior to use. 1H (400 MHz), 13C (100 MHz), and 31P (162 MHz) NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV400 instrument
at room temperature with CDCl3 as the solvent. Chemical
shifts were recorded in ppm, referenced to residual 1H
and 13C signals of the nondeuterated CDCl3 (δ
7.26 and 77.16) as internal standards or to the 31P signal
of PPh3 (δ −5.65) as an external standard.
Elemental analyses were performed on a PerkinElmer 240C analyzer.
The starting materials [Cp*MCl2]2 (M = Ir, Rh)
and terminal aromatic alkynes p-RC6H4C≡CH (R = H, MeO, or F) were purchased from Strem without
further purification; the ligand di(α-naphthyl)phenylphosphine
(1a) was prepared by literature methods.33

Synthesis of tert-Butyldi(α-naphthyl)phenylphosphine
(1b)
A solution of 1-bromonaphthalene (1.04
g, 5.0 mmol) in diethyl ether (5 mL) was slowly added over a period
of 10 min to a solution of n-butyllithium (1.6 M
solution in n-hexane) (3.2 mL, 5.0 mmol) in diethyl
ether (5 mL) at −78 °C. After allowing the reaction mixture
to stir for 30 min at room temperature, a solution of tert-butyldichlorophosphine (0.40 g, 2.5 mmol) in diethyl ether (5 mL)
was added dropwise to the above 1-naphthyl lithium solution. The resulting
solution was heated under reflux for 3 h, then allowed to come to
room temperature. The solvent was then removed under vacuum, and the
residue was chromatographed on a silica gel column with a mixture
of petrol ether/ethyl acetate (10:1) as the eluent. Removal of the
solvents from the above eluate yielded a pale yellow solid 1b (40%). 1H NMR: δ 8.70 (dd, J =

General Procedures for the Insertion Reactions
of Alkynes into
the Ir–C Bond of 3b
A mixture of 3b (15 mg, 0.02 mmol) and alkyne (4.0 equiv) in methanol (4
mL) was stirred for 1 h at room temperature. The solvent was then
removed under vacuum, and the residue was chromatographed on a silica
gel column with petrol ether or methanol as the eluent. The products
were recrystallized from n-hexane/CH2Cl2 at −10 °C to afford 12–14 as yellow crystals.

Crystallography
Single crystals of complexes 2a, 4a, 7, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15a, 15b, 15c, 16b, and 16c (CCDC reference numbers 1589471–1589482)
suitable for X-ray
diffraction were obtained by crystallization from n-hexane/CH2Cl2 (1:1). Data collection was performed
on a Bruker SMART 1000, using graphite-monochromated Mo Kα radiation
(ω–2θ scans, λ = 0.71073 Å). Semiempirical
absorption corrections were applied for all complexes. The structures
were solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least squares.
All calculations were using the SHELXL-97 program system. The crystal
data and summary of X-ray data collection are presented in Tables
S1–S3 in the Supporting Information.
