A hydrazone-based N′1,N′3-bis((E)-4-(diethylamino)-2–hydroxybenzylidene)isophthalohydrazide
(NDHIPH), has
been synthesized, characterized, and assessed for its highly selective
and sensitive (limit of detection, 2.53 nM) response toward Al(III)
via fluorescence enhancement in 95% aqueous medium. All experimental
results of analytical studies are in good consonance with the theoretical
studies performed. Further, this NDHIPH-Al(III) ensemble
is used for selective and sensitive (12.15 nM) detection of explosive
picric acid (PA) via fluorescence quenching. This reversible behavior
of NDHIPH toward Al(III) and PA is used for the creation
of a molecular logic gate.

Introduction
Fluorescent sensors
have attracted extensive inquisitiveness of
researchers in the past few decades owing to their operational simplicity,
extreme sensitivity of emission intensities and/or wavelengths to
subtle environmental changes, and direct visual perception selectivity.1 Out of various metal ions, aluminum, being the
most abundant one in the earth’s crust, finds wide applications
in industry and in our daily lives, such as in food additives, packing
materials, water treatment, paper making, production of light alloys,
and some medicines.2 Studies indicate that
excess accumulation of Al(III) can cause serious damage to the human
nervous system, which leads to diseases such as Alzheimer’s
and Parkinson’s diseases.3 Toxicity
due to Al(III) is also accountable for bone softening, impaired lung
function, fibrosis, chronic renal failure, etc.3 It is also found to be detrimental for aquatic life and
agricultural production by increasing the acidity of the soil.4 The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends
an average weekly human body dietary intake of Al(III) of around 7
mg/kg of body weight.5 Therefore, detection
of Al(III) is crucial in controlling its concentration levels both
in the environment and biological systems. Unfortunately, determination
of Al(III) is much more difficult in comparison to the determination
of other biologically important cations, such as Cu(II), Pb(II), Hg(II),
Zn(II), etc., due to its properties of strong hydration and poor coordination.
Although a significant number of chemosensors are known6 for sensing Al(III), they are relatively fewer
in number in comparison to those for sensing other metal ions. Hitherto,
many approaches such as atomic absorption spectroscopy, graphite furnace
atomic absorption spectrometry, inductively coupled plasma atomic
emission spectrometry, mass spectrometry, electrochemistry, and NMR
technology have been used for Al(III) detection.7 However, these methods have limitations, as they require
sophisticated instrumentation and are time-consuming. In contrast,
optical sensors have gathered interest for providing quick, low-cost,
nondestructive, and highly selective results. Hence, there is an ample
need to design and synthesize new chromo-fluorogenic Al(III) sensors
through simple synthetic mechanisms that possess a low detection limit
and high selectivity and sensitivity in aqueous medium.

Research
interests of our lab involve recognition of various biologically
important ions through usage of aromatic platform based chemosensors,8 which have imine/hydroxyl, urea/thiourea, thiosemicarbazide,
and hydrazone functional groups acting as receptor-cum-transducers.
We have already reported9 three positional
isomers of a Schiff base (DBIH1–DBIH3) for highly
selective and sensitive Al(III) detection (respective limit of detection
(LOD): 8.91, 14.1, and 19.95 nM) in 70% aqueous medium. Presently,
we report another highly sensitive (LOD 2.53 nM) and selective system, NDHIPH, for Al(III) detection. NDHIPH possesses
a coordination environment of −CONH, C=N, and −OH
groups (Scheme 1).
Being a hard acid, Al(III) prefers systems containing hard base sites
such as O and N; hence, NDHIPH provides an ideal framework
for the detection of Al(III) in 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic
acid (HEPES) buffer (pH 7.4, containing 5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
as a cosolvent). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were
performed to check the geometrical and electronic structural features
of NDHIPH and its Al(III) complex. The detection limit
achieved for NDHIPH is 2.53 nM, comparable to the concentration
range of Al(III) ions found in many chemical and biological systems.
Furthermore, NDHIPH finds application in the form of
“paper strips” that facilitate instant selective detection
of Al(III) in the presence of other interfering metal ions.

Results
and Discussion
Syntheses and General Characterization
N′1,N′3-bis((E)-4–(diethylamino)-2-hydroxybenzylidene)isophthalohydrazide
(NDHIPH) was synthesized by a Schiff base condensation
reaction of isophthalohydrazide
and (IPH)4-(diethylamino)-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (Scheme 1) and characterized by techniques
such as 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, distortionless
enhancement by polarization transfer (DEPT), correlation spectroscopy
(COSY), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, electrospray
ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), and CHN analysis (Figures S1–S7). In 1H NMR spectra
of NDHIPH, the signal of the −CH2 group
is merged with the residual peak of moisture, which is established
with techniques such as 13C NMR, DEPT, and COSY. The presence
of a peak at δ 44.2 in 13C and DEPT spectra confirms
the presence of the −CH2 group. Further, the COSY
spectrum also showed the interaction of methyl protons at δ
1.11 (position p) with the methylene proton at δ
3.38 (position o).

Colorimetric, Chromogenic,
and Fluorogenic Spectral Responses
of NDHIPH
NDHIPH exhibits two absorption bands
centered at 269 nm (ε = 2.03 × 104 M–1 cm–1) and 383 nm (ε = 9.17 × 104 M–1 cm–1) in HEPES buffer
(pH 7.4, containing 5% DMSO as a cosolvent) (Figure S8). These bands from 320 to 460 nm indicate internal charge
transfer between the imine and hydroxyl groups.10 On addition of Al(III) (inset, Figure 1) to NDHIPH, the
absorption band at 269 nm showed a slight increase in intensity, whereas
the band at 383 nm showed a bathochromic shift to 391 nm (ε
= 7.54 × 104 M–1 cm–1) along with the formation of two new bands at λmax of 411 nm (ε = 8.00 × 104 M–1 cm–1) and 436 nm (ε = 5.69 × 104 M–1 cm–1). The color
change from colorless to bright yellow (inset, Figure 1) corroborates these shifts in absorption
bands. The stoichiometry of the Al(III) complex of NDHIPH is checked using a Job’s plot, which turns out to be 1:2
(Figure S9).

Figure 1 (a) Changes in absorption
spectra of NDHIPH in DMSO:HEPES (5:95)
(10 μM) upon gradual addition of Al(III). Inset: Color change
in the sensor solution with Al(III).

Further, NDHIPH was investigated for its fluorogenic
properties in HEPES buffer (pH 7.4, containing 5% DMSO as a cosolvent)
(Figure 2). It exhibits
a very weak fluorescence (Φ = 0.11) at λem of
529 nm (excitation at 383 nm), which may be due to the excited-state
intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) phenomenon, well known in the
case of Schiff’s bases.10

fluorescence spectra of NDHIPH in DMSO:HEPES (5:95)
(1 μM) upon the addition of 10 equiv of various metal nitrates.
Inset: Color changes in the sensor solution with Al(III) under a UV
lamp.

This type of phenomenon generally
involves the conversion of a
basal enol form to an excited enol form as a result of the transfer
of a hydroxy proton to the nitrogen atom of the imine group, which
ultimately leads to the formation of a cis-keto tautomer (also a π–π*
state or keto*). This cis-keto form may further undergo relaxation
toward a ground-state trans-keto (or keto) isomer form (photochromic
tautomer) along with a large Stokes shift of 145 nm (from 383 to 528
nm) after photoinduced proton transfer.10 When treated with Al(III), NDHIPH caused a significant
fluorescence enhancement along with a hypsochromic shift from 529
to 485 nm (λex 383 nm) (Figure 3). This remarkable fluorescence enhancement
may be attributed to the metal coordination of NDHIPH through the lone pair of electrons of nitrogens of imine and oxygens
of hydroxyl groups, which gives rise to a tetradentate N2O2 donor site for the generation of a stable chelated
system with high rigidity and results in an efficient chelation-enhanced
fluorescence. Further, the selectivity of NDHIPH can
be checked by screening it with various metal ions under study. The
addition of Li(I), Na(I), K(I), Ag(I), Mg(II), Ca(II), Cd(II), Ba(II),
and Sr(II) showed no significant change, whereas Bi(III) and Zn(II)
showed a slight fluorescence enhancement and Co(II), Cr(III), Cu(II),
Fe(III), Hg(II), Ni(II), and Pb(II) caused quenching to various extents
(Figure 3).11,12 Sensor NDHIPH showed no significant change in selectivity
when different counteranions were investigated under the same conditions
by using Al2(SO4)3 and AlCl3 (Figure S10). The reversibility of the
recognition process of NDHIPH toward Al(III) was studied
by the alternating addition of Al(III) and a strong chelating agent
such as the disodium salt of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (Figure S11).

Figure 3 Variation in fluorescence intensity of NDHIPH in DMSO:HEPES
(5:95) (1 μM) with the addition of metal nitrates.

Further, the 1:2 stoichiometry (Figure S12) of NDHIPH–Al(III) was checked
through
fluorescence using a Job’s plot. This stoichiometry was also
supported by a peak in the mass spectrum at m/z 798.1951, assignable to [(NDHIPH-Al(III)-NO2)•]+ = [(C30H34Al2N10O16– NO2)•] = [(C30H34Al2N9O14)•]+. The
simulated mass spectrum agrees well with that of the experimental
one (Figure S20). The binding constant
of NDHIPH with Al(III), 4.25 × 1012 M–2 (Figure S13), was determined
through titration of NDHIPH with Al(III), employing a
modified form of the Benesi–Hildebrand plot (ref (3)a in the Supporting Information). Selectivity is another important
criterion of an efficient fluorescent sensor, which is checked for NDHIPH by titrating it with Al(III) in the presence of other
metal ions (Figure S14), which revealed
that NDHIPH can detect Al(III) even in the presence of
other competitive metal ions. For this experiment, NDHIPH was treated with 10 equiv of Al(III) in the presence of 100 equiv
of other metal ions. There was a slight interference in the case of
Cu(II) and Fe(III), which showed some quenching but enhancement was
clearly detectable, whereas other metal ions showed no significant
interference with Al(III). The quantum yields of NDHIPH and its Al(III) complex were determined to be 0.11 and 0.78 using
9,10-diphenylanthracene as the standard. The limit of detection13 (LOD) of NDHIPH for Al(III) (Figure S15) was calculated from fluorescence
titrations to be 2.53 × 10–9 M, which is quite
lower than the limit specified by the WHO. Further, for realistic
applications, the sensitivity of NDHIPH was also checked
toward variations in the pH by performing fluorescence titration by
adjusting the pH with HCl and NaOH in the presence and absence of
Al(III) (Figure S16). An analysis of pH-induced
changes in fluorescence at λmax = 485 nm showed that NDHIPH remains unaffected over the pH range of 2.24–10.09.
For NDHIPH-Al(III), a large increase in intensity is
observed at pH 4.05 and the intensity remains almost constant till
pH 11.03, which is a good range for analysis in a biological medium.
This working range for NDHIPH and its Al(III) complex
may be attributed to the decomposition caused at a high pH and protonation
of the phenolic hydroxyl groups at a low pH.

Sensing Mechanism
To further dig into the NDHIPH-Al(III) interactions,
NMR titrations were performed in DMSO-d6, (Figure 4). With
the addition of Al(III) to the solution of NDHIPH, the
peak for −OH at δ 11.42 almost disappears
completely along with a slight downward shift of the peak for −NH
owing to deprotonation of former groups and complexation by imine
and −OH groups. The signals of aromatic protons at positions l, i, and j (in the vicinity of
the −OH group) and protons of −CH=N groups showed
downward shifts, whereas aromatic protons at positions “a” and “b” remain virtually
unperturbed (Figure S17 and Table S1).
The formation of the NDHIPH-Al(III) complex was further
confirmed by isolating the solid complex formed by reacting NDHIPH with Al(NO3)3·9H2O in ethanol and characterizing it by NMR, IR, and mass spectroscopy
(Figures S18–S20).

Figure 4 Changes in 1H NMR of NDHIPH (5 mM) upon the addition
of Al(III) in DMSO-d6.

Response of the NDHIPH-Al(III) Ensemble toward Organic Nitro
Derivatives
The NDHIPH-Al(III) ensemble showed
another useful property in the form of a selective and sensitive probe
for the detection of organic nitro-based explosives. When titrated
with various nitro derivatives, the ensemble showed a highly selective
response only toward picric acid (PA). With the addition of PA, the
absorption bands of the ensemble metalloligand NDHIPH-Al(III) at λmax of 411 and 436 nm showed a large
increase in intensity (Figure S21a), whereas
it showed significant quenching of the emission band at 485 nm (Figure S21b). To examine the selectivity of NDHIPH-Al(III) for PA, its fluorescence response was investigated
toward different analytes, such as picric acid (PA), 2-nitrophenol
(2-NP), 4-nitrophenol (4-NP), 2-nitrotoluene (2-NT), 4-nitrotoluene
(4-NT), 2,4-dinitrophenol (2,4-DNP), 3,5-dinitrophenol (3,5-DNP),
Cl–, Br–, I–, F–, CN–, ClO4–, NO2–, CH3CO2–, C6H5CO2–, HSO4– H2PO4–, PO43–, AMP, ADP, and ATP (Figure 5).

Figure 5 Competitive selectivity of NDHIPH-Al(III) (1μM) toward picric
acid (PA) in the presence of various anions under study.

Interestingly, only the addition of PA instantly causes significant
fluorescence quenching, whereas no significant change in fluorescence
intensity is observed in other cases. A fluorescence titration of
ML with PA (ϕ = 0.040) (Figure 6) caused quenching gradually up to the extent of 96%,
which is calculated using the formula: [Io – I]/Io ×
100, where Io is the original fluorescence
intensity and I is the fluorescence intensity of
ML.

Figure 6 Changes in the fluorescence spectra of ML in DMSO:HEPES (5:95)
(5 μM) upon gradual addition of picric acid (0–50 μM).
Inset: Color changes in ML solution with PA under a UV lamp.

These changes in fluorescence intensity were consistent
with the
disappearance of the fluorescent green color (under a UV lamp, Figure 6, inset, right).
Further, this fluorescence quenching data were analyzed using a Stern–Völmer
plot, which showed a linear dependence of the fluorescence intensity
ratio (I/Io) on the concentration
of Al(III) ions added (Figure S22). The
value of Ksv for the complex of PA and NDHIPH-Al(III) was calculated to be 1.165 × 106 M–1. The 1:2 stoichiometry of binding between
the NDHIPH-Al(III) and PA was calculated using a Job’s
plot (Figure S23), which was further confirmed
by the appearance of a peak in high-resolution ESI-HRMS at m/z 1130.1980 assignable to [(NDHIPH-Al(III)
+ PA-NO2)•]+ = [(C42H38Al2N14O24–NO2)•]+ = [(C42H38Al2N13O22)•+] (calc 1130.1980) (Figure S24). This
interaction of the NDHIPH-Al(III) complex with PA was
also studied by 1H NMR titrations (Figure S25), although no significant chemical shift with addition
of picric acid was observed except for an increase in the intensity
of the peak at 8.6 ppm for the aromatic protons of picric acid. The
detection limit of the NDHIPH-Al(III) ensemble toward
PA was calculated to be 12.15 nM (Figure S26). Hence, the mechanism proposed for the quenching of picric acid
involved replacement of one NO3 ligand of Al in NDHIPH-AL
with picric acid in its phenoxide anion form. In Table S2, we have compared the outcomes of NDHIPH with the already reported literature values.

Computational Analysis
of NDHIPH, NDHIPH-Al(III) Complex, and
NDHIPH-Al(III) Complex with Picric Acid
To identify the geometrical
and electronic structural features of NDHIPH and its
possible Al(III) complexes, density functional theory (DFT) calculations
were performed using the Gaussian 09 package.14 The results show that there can be three geometrical isomers of NDHIPH (Figures 7 and S27), with comparable energies (Table S3). NDHIPH exists in the
hydrazide form, NDHIPH-r is its rotamer, and NDHIPH-t is an azine tautomer of NDHIPH-r.15 The rotamer is more stable by only 0.19 kcal/mol, whereas
the tautomer is less stable by only 0.82 kcal/mol. NDHIPH and its rotamer are characterized by two intramolecular hydrogen
bonds each, and the tautomer is characterized by two bifurcated hydrogen
bonds. NDHIPH possesses two benzylidene groups coplanar
with the attached hydrazide moieties. However, the overall geometry
is nonplanar. Stability is attained due to the E/E configuration along C1–N1–N2–C2
bonds, O2–H···1 hydrogen bonding,
and C1–H···O type of weak hydrogen
bonding interaction. In the ground state, NDHIPH exists
in the enol form. Thus, a time-dependent DFT calculation (TDDFT) was
performed to identify the intramolecular proton transfer through the
excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) mechanism. The
obtained geometry, NDHIPH(keto), in the excited state
possessed a cis-keto configuration and was characterized by a ππ*
transition state, which attained stability due to O2···H–N1 intramolecular hydrogen
bonding (Figure 7).

Figure 7 Proposed
isomers of NDHIPH, optimized at the B3LYP/6-311 + G(d,p)
level of theory. NDHIPH(keto) was obtained using the TDDFT excited-state
calculation with the same basis set.

Complexation of NDHIPH with Al(III) can result in
three probable complexes, namely, A, B,
and C (Figure 8), depending on the stoichiometry of the reaction (Figure S26). When an equimolar amount of Al(NO3)3 is considered, two complexes A and B were possible. Quantum chemical analysis indicates that
the formation of A demands 15.20 kcal/mol (endergonic),
whereas the formation of B is exergonic by 19.32 kcal/mol.
Two equivalents of Al(NO3)3 leads to the formation
of complex C, releasing 35.25 kcal/mol. In principle, NDHIPH-t can also yield two metal complexes, B′ with the loss of two units of HNO3 and complex C′ with the loss of four units of HNO3.
Formation of B′ and C′ is
exergonic by 4.15 and 10.31 kcal/mol, respectively (Figure S29). The three-dimensional (3D) structures of all
complexes are provided in Figure S30. The
energetics of the complexation reaction indicates that C is the most stable complex (Figure S28). The optimized 3D structure of C (Figure 9) shows that the bond length
between Al and O2 is 1.777 Å and the Al–N1 bond length is 1.956 Å. After complexation, the C1–N1 bond is elongated from 1.299
to 1.318 Å due to the involvement of N1 in coordination.
The C–O2 bond length is decreased from 1.349
to 1.321 Å. The C–C1 bond is shortened
to 1.412 from 1.443 Å, and a slight elongation of the aromatic
C=C bond is observed after complexation. This transformation
makes a conjugated system through benzylidene and hydrazide, which
results in a stable NDHIPH-Al(III) complex. The angles
around Al are observed to be between 93 and 108°, which indicates
that both the Al centers have a distorted trigonal-bipyramidal configuration.
This complex is also characterized by a N2–H···O–NO2 hydrogen bonding interaction with a bond length of 2.130
Å.

Figure 8 Possible complexes (A, B, and C) formed as a result of the reaction
of NDHIPH with Al(NO3)3; C + PA is the complex
of C with picric acid. The geometries are obtained at the B3LYP/6-311
+ G(d,p) level of theory.

acid, C + PA; hydrogens are hidden for the clarity of
image. Bond lengths are given in Å and all geometries are optimized
at the B3LYP/6-311 + G(d,p) level of theory.

The optimized 3D geometry of complex of C with picric
acid (C + PA) indicates that picric acid was bound to
Al in the form of a phenoxide anion by replacing one NO3 ligand of the Al (Figure 8). The bond length between O1″ and
Al was observed to be 1.850 Å, which is slightly longer than
the Al–O2 bond length and shorter than the
Al–ONO2 bond length (2.001 Å). The coordination
through O of one of the o-NO2 groups of
picric acid (with Al–O2″ bond length
= 1.997 Å) stabilized the complex. Bidentate ligation of picric
acid to Al may affect the aromaticity of the ring (Figure 9b).

Frontier molecular
orbital analysis (Figures 10 and S31) shows
that the energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital
(HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of NDHIPH is 3.39 eV, which is reduced to 3.12 eV after coordination
with Al as in complex C.

Figure 10 HOMO–LUMO orbitals
of NDHIPH, its keto form
in the excited state, and its Al(III) complex.

On the other hand, the HOMO–LUMO gap of the keto form of NDHIPH (Figure 10) is 1.06 eV in the excited state. Presumably, a slight decrease
in energy gap after metal complexation is responsible for the absorption
phenomenon of the ligand, while showing a bathochromic shift in the
UV–visible spectrum. Contrarily, the same energy difference
is greater than the HOMO–LUMO gap of the keto form in the excited
state. Thus, the observed hypsochromic shift in the fluorescence spectrum
can be explained.16

Logic Gate
The
reversible behavior of the fluorogenic
response of NDHIPH at 485 nm toward Al(III) ions and
picric acid can be usefully engaged in the construction of an INHIBIT
logic gate with two inputs, Al(III) and picric acid (Figure 11). In the first case, both
the inputs are absent; there is no significant change in the fluorescence
emission of NDHIPH at 485 nm, which implies that the
gate is “OFF” or in the “0” state. In
the second case, when only Al(III) is added, large fluorescence enhancement
implies that the gate is “ON” or in the “1”
state. In the third case, when only picric acid is added to NDHIPH,
the result is OFF or the 0 state. In the fourth case, when both the
inputs are present, the quenching (by input 2, PA) of the fluorescence
of NDHIPH at 485 nm should override the fluorescence
enhancement by input 1, which is in accordance with the truth table
and the circuit for the INHIBIT gate.

logic gate. (a) Truth table corresponding
to the INHIBIT logic gate. (b) Pictorial representation of the logic
gate. (c) Bar chart presentation of fluorescence outputs. (d) Visual
color outputs.

Paper Strip Experiment
To check the practical usefulness
of NDHIPH, we accomplished a paper strip experiment for
the on-site detection of metal ions.

The paper strips were coated
first with an aqueous solution of NDHIPH and then dried
for 30 min. for uniform distribution of the sensor. After drying,
these strips were dipped in a solution of Al(NO3)3 (5 μM) in distilled water and dried again for 30 min. Further,
these strips were checked under a UV lamp. Bright bluish green fluorescence
was observed on that part of the test strip that was dipped in the
solution of Al(NO3)3, whereas the other part
of the test strip showed no change. Similar color changes were observed
in the solid state (Figure 12) as earlier in the solution state.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have
designed and synthesized a new hydrazone-based
Schiff base, NDHIPH, which possesses a coordination environment
of −CONH, C=N, and −OH groups and exhibits excellent
selectivity and sensitivity toward Al(III). The detection limit of NDHIPH toward Al(III) is 2.53 nM. Further, the NDHIPH-Al(III) ensemble acts as a selective and sensitive probe for picric
acid. DFT calculations were performed for NDHIPH, NDHIPH-Al(III),
and the complex between NDHIPH-Al(III) and picric acid. The reversible
behavior of NDHIPH toward Al(III) and picric acid leads
to the creation of an INHIBIT logic gate. Hence, these results specify
that NDHIPH will be a significant addition in the perception
of sensing of trace metal ions in aqueous medium.
