The
regulation of pH is essential for proper organelle function, and organelle-specific
changes in pH often reflect the dynamics of physiological signaling
and metabolism. For example, mitochondrial energy production depends
on the proton gradient maintained between the alkaline mitochondrial
matrix and neutral cytosol. However, we still lack a quantitative
understanding of how pH dynamics are coupled between compartments
and how pH gradients are regulated at organelle boundaries. Genetically
encoded pH sensors are well suited to address this problem because
they can be targeted to specific subcellular locations and they facilitate
live, single-cell analysis. However, most of these pH sensors are
derivatives of green and yellow fluorescent proteins that are not
spectrally compatible for dual-compartment imaging. Therefore, there
is a need for ratiometric red fluorescent protein pH sensors that
enable quantitative multicolor imaging of spatially resolved pH dynamics.
In this work, we demonstrate that the I158E/Q160A mutant of the red
fluorescent protein mCherry is an effective ratiometric pH sensor.
It has a pKa of 7.3 and a greater than
3-fold change in ratio signal. To demonstrate its utility in cells,
we measured activity and metabolism-dependent pH dynamics in cultured
primary neurons and neuroblastoma cells. Furthermore, we were able
to image pH changes simultaneously in the cytosol and mitochondria
by using the mCherryEA mutant together with the green fluorescent
pH sensor, ratiometric-pHluorin. Our results demonstrate the feasibility
of studying interorganelle pH dynamics in live cells over time and
the broad applicability of these sensors in studying the role of pH
regulation in metabolism and signaling.

==== Body
Introduction
In eukaryotic cells,
pH compartmentalization is critical for cellular processes, such as
mitochondrial energy production, protein degradation in lysosomes,
and post-translational protein modification in the endoplasmic reticulum.1,2 In the brain, for example, organelle pH gradients are essential
for proper neurophysiology. The acidification of synaptic vesicles
provides the proton motive force for neurotransmitter loading, and
the alkalinization of the mitochondrial matrix provides the proton
motive force for adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) synthesis,
both of which are required for the energetically expensive process
of neurotransmission.3,4 Because neurotransmission is fundamentally
a pH-dependent process, pH is also a useful indicator of activity.
For example, transient pH fluctuations in the cytosol of neurons occur
due to proton and ion fluxes and mitochondrial pH fluctuates in response
to energy consumption during action potential generation.5−7

Aberrant changes in pH are also commonly seen in diseases.
For example, significant pH changes are seen during neurological disorders
such as stroke and ischemia, where pH dynamics during hypoxia plays
an important role in cell survival.1,8 In cancer,
altered pH homeostasis can occur9 and the
Warburg effect and metabolic reprogramming can cause intracellular
alkalinization and extracellular acidification, both of which may
play important roles in cell survival.10−12 Furthermore, regulation
of organelle pH has been linked to oncogenic signaling13,14 but we still need new pH sensors to accurately study organelle pH
changes in the context of the entire cell.

In biological imaging
studies, spatially resolved pH dynamics are commonly visualized using
pH-sensitive dyes, such as BCECF or SNARF,15 and genetically encoded green and yellow fluorescent protein-based
pH sensors, such as pHluorin and SypHer.16,17 Genetically encoded sensors are advantageous because they can be
targeted to subcellular locations. However, to study the role of proton
exchange and buffering between different compartments in pH regulation,
we need a toolbox of both green and red fluorescent pH sensors for
multiplex imaging. Currently, many of the red fluorescent protein
(RFP) sensors, such as pHTomato,18 pHuji,19 and mNectarine,20 report pH changes on the basis of fluorescence intensity alone.
These sensors have high dynamic range and are very useful for the
detection of events such as synaptic vesicle release.21 However, ratiometric sensors are better suited for quantifying
pH changes because they are insensitive to variations in sensor concentration
and photobleaching, which facilitates the comparison of pH dynamics
between independent experiments. The ratiometric red fluorescent protein
pH sensor pHRed22 has been used to monitor
pH fluctuations in mitochondria23 and to
measure peroxisomal pH.24 However, pHRed
has a pKa of 6.9, which limits its sensitivity
in alkaline compartments because it exhibits smaller changes in its
signal at pH greater than 8. The availability of spectral variants
and pH sensors with a range of pKa values
would facilitate the study of pH changes in various cellular compartments.

In this study, we demonstrate that the I158E/Q160A mutant of mCherry,
originally reported by Piatkevich et al.,25 is an effective ratiometric red fluorescent protein pH sensor. We
characterize the pH-dependent fluorescence properties of the mCherry
mutant protein in solution, and we also characterize its pH sensing
performance in live cells. To demonstrate its use in biological studies,
we show that it reports pH dynamics caused by changes in neuronal
activity and metabolism. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it is spectrally
compatible with the green fluorescent pH sensor ratiometric-pHluorin,
facilitating the visualization of pH changes in mitochondria and the
cytosol simultaneously within the same live cell.

Results
Characterization
of mCherryEA as a Ratiometric pH Sensor
We first demonstrated
that the mCherry(I158E/Q160A) mutant, which we refer to as “mCherryEA”,
is a ratiometric pH sensor. The I158E and Q160A mutations were originally
engineered to support excited-state proton transfer (ESPT) in mCherry
to generate a long Stokes shift (LSS) variant (Figure 1A).25 This mutant
has not been used as a long Stokes shift RFP because at neutral pH,
it exhibits two excitation peaks corresponding to the protonated and
deprotonated chromophore, with a single emission peak (Figure 1B). However, we hypothesized
that existence of the two peaks would instead make the mutant an effective
ratiometric pH sensor because it is proposed that the protonation
state of Glu158 is sensitive to the pH of the surrounding solution,25 resulting in pH-dependent protonation of the
chromophore.

fluorescence. (D) The pH titration curves for the fluorescence intensity

(G) quantum yield (QY), and (H) brightness (ε·QY) (n = 2). Data were fit to a Boltzmann equation, ratio = minimum
+ (maximum – minimum)/(1 + exp((pH – pKa)/slope)). Errors are standard deviation (std).

To determine whether the mCherryEA
mutant exhibits a pH-dependent ratiometric change in the excitation
spectra peaks, we characterized the pH response of purified mCherryEA
protein in solution. The mutant showed pH-dependent changes in its
excitation spectra with a ratiometric change in excitation peaks at
455 and 585 nm, without a significant spectral shift in the emission
peak at 610 nm (Figure 1B,C). We did not observe residual green emission from immature chromophore,
and thus mCherryEA is compatible with blue, cyan, green, and yellow
fluorescent proteins that exhibit spectrally distinct emission peaks.
As predicted, the proton-transfer network25 results in an “inverse” pH dependence with an increase
from pH 5.5 to 9, causing a 2.80 ± 0.14-fold increase in the
455 nm peak (protonated form) and 2.54 ± 0.20-fold decrease in
the 585 nm peak (deprotonated form), with a pKa of 7.8 (Figure 1D). Fold change was measured by dividing the highest fluorescence
ratio by the lowest fluorescence ratio. The intensity ratio (F585nm/F455nm) showed
a 6.90 ± 0.83-fold (n = 7, mean ± std)
increase with decrease in pH from 9 to 5.5, and the pKa was 7.29 ± 0.03 for the ratio response (Figure 1E). The pH response
was insensitive to variation of salts (NaCl, KCl, MgCl2, and K-gluconate), oxidative stress (H2O2 and
dithiothreitol (DTT)), and temperature (25–37 °C) (Figure S-1).

To compare the brightness
of the mCherryEA mutant relative to wild-type mCherry, we measured
the extinction coefficient (ε) and quantum yield (QY) of each
protein in solution. At pH 7.5, the mutant (ε = 11 650
M–1 cm–1, QY = 0.05) was dimmer
compared to wild-type mCherry (ε = 72 000 M–1 cm–1, QY = 0.22).26 Both the excitation peaks showed an increase in QY with increasing
pH (Figure 1F). However,
the ε530nm decreased with increasing pH and ε440nm remains relatively unchanged (Figure 1G). The brightness (ε·QY) for
the 455 nm peak showed a larger change compared to that of the 585
nm peak, and it drives the dynamic range of the ratio (Figure 1H). These results show that
the mCherryEA mutant can serve as a ratiometric pH sensor, and therefore
it could be an important addition to the toolset of quantitative pH
sensors. However, due to the relatively low brightness of the purified
protein, we next characterized the sensor expressed in live cells
and found it to be well suited for live-cell ratiometric imaging.

Live-Cell Ratiometric pH Imaging
To test mCherryEA as a
pH sensor in cellular imaging, we expressed the protein in mammalian
cells. The brightness of mCherryEA was comparable to that of pHRed
in several mammalian cell lines using exactly the same illumination
and imaging conditions (Figures 2 and S-2), and we did not
observe any cell toxicity during extended imaging sessions that lasted
over 2 h. Differences in sensor characteristics in live cells compared
with purified protein measurements have been observed for other fluorescent
proteins and sensors, although the exact reasons are unknown.27,28 Thus, despite the low ε and QY measured for purified protein
in solution, in live cells, mCherryEA exhibits sufficient brightness
to provide a high fluorescence signal over the background.

Figure 2 mCherryEA reports
live-cell pH changes in different cell types. (A) Top: differential
interference contrast (DIC) and fluorescence images showing the expression
of mCherryEA in the cytosol of Neuro2A cells. Bottom: representative
pseudocolored image sequence showing changes in the pixel-by-pixel

pH response in primary astrocytes expressing mCherryEA upon exposure
to 10 mM NH4Cl (n = 11).

We next tested mCherryEA’s pH response by
exposing the cells to ammonium chloride (NH4Cl). It is
well-established that exposure to NH4Cl causes a transient
alkalinization and reacidification upon washout.29 The responsiveness of the mutant was demonstrated in Neuro2A
cells expressing mCherryEA in the cytosol (Figure 2A). The cells were exposed to 10 mM NH4Cl for 5 min and then washed with imaging solution. The pH
response was determined by measuring the ratio F575nm/F440nm for single cells over
time (Figure 2A). As
expected, the addition of NH4Cl caused alkalinization of
the cytosol, followed by reacidification upon removal of NH4Cl (Figure 2B). We
found that mCherryEA exhibited a 2.3 ± 0.2-fold change in ratio
signal (n = 20, mean ± std) in response to the
NH4Cl transient, which was comparable to the 4.2 ±
0.7-fold change observed for pHRed (n = 29, mean
± std) (Figures 2B and S-2). We saw similar responses in
cultured primary astrocytes (Figures 2C and S-3) and in HEK-293
cells (Figure S-3). Note that the lag in
pH response to NH4Cl is caused by the slow perfusion delay
and variability in mixing in the live-cell imaging chamber, which
also contributes to overall differences in the response. Interestingly,
we observed that primary astrocytes regulate cytosolic pH more strongly
than Neuro2A cells. That is, the astrocytes exhibited a rebound neutralization
during the NH4Cl exposure, which was not observed in Neuro2A
cells (Figure 2B,C).
It is not clear if this is an active or passive homeostatic mechanism,
but future experiments could address the energy dependence of the
response by pairing mCherryEA with one of the currently available
green fluorescent ATP sensors.30−32

We did observe that long-term
expression of both wild-type mCherry and mutant mCherryEA resulted
in the formation of red fluorescent puncta in cultured astrocytes
after several days (Figure S-3). This may
be due to protein accumulation in lysosomes, which has been observed
for other red fluorescent proteins.33−35 To avoid complications
caused by puncta formation, all subsequent experiments were carried
out 2 days after transfection when neurons and Neuro2A cells did not
show any puncta and therefore did not interfere with its use or analysis.

Live-Cell pH Calibration
To calibrate the pH response, we
performed an in situ pH titration in Neuro2A cells, expressing cytoplasmic
mCherryEA using the ionophore nigericin. Nigericin is a K+/H+ ionophore, which equilibrates the intracellular pH
and extracellular pH when high-potassium imaging solution is used.36 The cells were exposed to nigericin solutions
to clamp cytosolic pH from pH 5.5 to 9, and steady-state values were
measured over a period of 15–30 min (Figure S-4). mCherryEA in cells has a pKa of 7.31 ± 0.01 (n = 3, mean ± std) (Figure 3A), consistent with
the pKa measured with the purified protein
in solution (Figure 1E). We also carried out an end-of-experiment nigericin pH calibration
after exposing cells to an ammonium chloride transient pulse, demonstrating
that it is possible to normalize ratio signals into pH values (Figures 3B and S-5).

and mitochondria live cells. (A) pH titration of Neuro2A cells expressing

(red line) and mito-ratiometric-pHluorin (green dashed line) using

each). (E) pH change upon exposure to a transient 10 mM NH4Cl pulse in Neuro2A cells expressing mito-mCherryEA that were calibrated
using nigericin plus monensin at the end of the experiment (n = 7). Bars indicate std.

The pKa of mCherryEA also makes
it well suited for studying pH changes in the mitochondria matrix,
which can fluctuate between neutral and alkaline conditions (pH 7–8).17,37 We first demonstrated efficient targeting of mito-mCherryEA in Neuro2A
cells using the mitochondrial stain, MitoTracker Deep Red, and high-magnification
images confirm colocalization of mito-mCherryEA and MitoTracker (Pearson
correlation coefficient 0.93 ± 0.06, n = 12
cells) (Figures 3C
and S-6). The in situ pH titration of Neuro2A
cells expressing mito-mCherryEA was carried out using nigericin plus
monensin to clamp mitochondrial pH from pH 5.5 to 9,17 and we measured a pKa of 7.18
± 0.09 (n = 3, mean ± std) similar to that
of both purified protein and in situ cytosolic values (Figure 3D). Again, we carried out an
end-of-experiment pH calibration using nigericin plus monensin following
an ammonium chloride treatment to demonstrate that ratio signals can
be normalized to mitochondrial pH values (Figure 3E). Interestingly, we observed that mitochondrial
pH resided near neutral pH, as has been observed for HeLa cells in
other studies.17

For comparison to
mCherryEA, ratiometric-pHluorin16 is a
green fluorescent pH sensor that is also based on a mutated single
fluorescent protein. In the cytoplasm, mCherryEA exhibited a maximum
fold change of ratiomax/ratiomin = 3.84 ±
0.91 (mean ± std, n = 6), which is similar to
ratiometric-pHluorin expressed in the cytosol of cells (ratiomax/ratiomin = 2.83 ± 0.20, pKa = 6.38 ± 0.77, n = 3) (Figure 3A). The maximum fold
change was similar for mCherryEA in mitochondria (ratiomax/ratiomin = 4.42 ± 1.08, mean ± std). However,
mito-ratiometric-pHluorin showed a dampened dynamic range (ratiomax/ratiomin = 1.36 ± 0.16, pKa = 6.83 ± 0.10, mean ± std, n = 3) (Figure 3D).

Thus, we have demonstrated that mCherryEA can be used for calibrated
pH measurements in the cytosol and mitochondria of live cells. Ideally,
in situ pH calibrations are carried out on a cell-by-cell basis at
the end of each experiment to transform the ratio signal into an absolute
pH value.17 However, in practice, ionophores
and permeabilization reagents such as nigericin and monensin can cause
cell death in sensitive cell types such as primary neurons or after
experimental paradigms that already cause significant cell stress
and the low yield of successful calibrations can be prohibitive. Despite
this complication, relative pH changes within a compartment can be
measured more easily and have proven sufficient for studying many
physiological processes, including metabolism and neuronal activity.38−40 Therefore, we next demonstrated that mCherryEA can be used together
with ratiometric-pHluorin to measure relative changes in compartment-specific
pH, taking advantage of the fact that the spectral cross talk between
mCherryEA and ratiometric-pHluorin is minimal (≤3%). Although
the ratio signals that we measure cannot be used to directly compare
absolute differences in pH between compartments, they can be used
to observe correlations between relative pH changes. We conducted
two proof-of-concept experiments. First, we demonstrated that both
cytosolic and mitochondrial pH exhibit activity-dependent acidification
in neurons. To do this, we expressed mCherryEA in cytosol and ratiometric-pHluorin
in mitochondria. Second, we demonstrated that relative changes in
cytosolic and mitochondrial pH correlate with metabolic inhibition.
To do this, we also demonstrate that mCherryEA and ratiometric-pHluorin
can be used in either compartment.

Neuronal Activity-Dependent
pH Dynamics
Neuronal activity involves membrane depolarization,
and membrane depolarization results in the acidification of neurons.8,41 Membrane depolarization can be caused by neurotransmitters such
as glutamate or a rise in external potassium chloride, and both proton
fluxes through channels and metabolic generation of acid equivalents
can contribute to the pH dynamics.42,43 To test the
utility of mCherryEA in visualizing this activity-dependent acidification,
we expressed mCherryEA in the cytosol of cultured mouse hippocampal
neurons (Figure 4A).
Upon transient stimulation with 10 μM glutamate, we were able
to visualize acidification in the cytosol, as expected (Figures 4B,C first arrow and S-7). This was followed by wash-in of 100 μM
ATP before a second pulse of glutamate in the presence of ATP (Figure 4B,C second arrow).
ATP was then washed out prior to a third glutamate application (Figure 4B,C third arrow).
The activity-dependent acidification of the cytosol could be observed
with repeated glutamate stimulation, and it was not modified by the
application of neuromodulators, such as extracellular ATP acting on
neuronal purinergic receptors.44 To validate
that mCherryEA was responsive to both acidic and alkaline changes
in pH, we exposed neurons to a transient pulse of NH4Cl.
Cells exhibited a biphasic response, demonstrating that it is functionally
responsive in neurons, similar to other cell types (Figure 2). Because energy metabolism
contributes significantly to activity-dependent acidification, we
also investigated pH dynamics more closely in both the cytosol and
mitochondria.

images showing cortical neurons: DIC, cytosolic mCherryEA (red, λex = 575 nm, λem = 632 nm), mitochondrial

time in the cytosol (red) and mitochondria (green, dashed) upon addition

response. (D–E) Hippocampal neurons coexpressing cytosolic

treated with 10 mM NH4Cl at the end of the experiment to
validate the sensor response. Bars indicate std.

Neuron excitation is a highly energy consuming process, requiring
increased glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration for ATP production.
Thus, the increased energy demand drives pH changes in both the cytosol
and the mitochondrial matrix, and we used a dual pH sensor imaging
approach to test how strongly the compartment-specific pH dynamics
is coupled to activity. By coexpressing cytosolic mCherryEA and mitochondria-targeted
ratiometric-pHluorin45 in the same neurons
(Figures 4 and S-8), we were able to observe synchronous activity-dependent
pH changes with similar dynamics in cytosol and mitochondria. Notably,
the spectral cross talk between the mCherryEA red fluorescence and
ratiometric-pHluorin green fluorescence channels is minimal (≤3%)
and does not account for the synchronous changes in cytosolic and
mitochondria pH. Thus, the ratio signals report that activity-dependent
acidification occurred in each compartment. Although we were unable
to carry out pH calibrations due to the toxicity of nigericin and
monensin to the cultured neurons, the responsivity of both sensors
was validated at the end of the experiment by exposing the cells to
NH4Cl. The activity-dependent pH responses observed in
both the cytosol and mitochondria could indicate coupling of neuronal
activity to mitochondrial ATP synthesis or uncoupling of pH compartmentation
due to increased Ca2+ flux. For example, Azarias et al.
saw glutamate-induced acidification in mitochondria of astrocytes,
which they report was due to loss of cytosol-mitochondrial pH gradient.
They also saw pH-dependent loss of metabolism in mitochondria.46 Further calibration and studies with metabolic
sensors would help us better understand the effect of increased neuronal
activity on pH and neuron metabolism. Overall, in this proof-of-concept
study, we validated that mCherryEA can be used to measure pH dynamics
in cultured neurons. We were also able to observe activity-dependent
pH changes in different compartments by expressing mCherryEA in the
cytosol and ratiometric-pHluorin in the mitochondria of the same cell.

We next tested whether simultaneous imaging of mCherryEA and ratiometric-pHluorin
could reveal compartment-specific differences in metabolism-dependent
pH dynamics. Since the pKa of mCherryEA
also makes it well suited for studying pH changes in the neutral to
alkaline range in mitochondria, we set out to test the utility of
mCherryEA in measuring mitochondrial pH dynamics. We confirmed the
efficient localization of mCherryEA and ratiometric-pHluorin using
confocal imaging to demonstrate that mCherryEA could be efficiently
targeted to the mitochondrial matrix when co-transfected with cytosolic
ratiometric-pHluorin (Figure 5).

Figure 5 Confocal microscopy. Dual-compartment imaging with mito-mCherryEA
and cyto-ratiometric-pHluorin. Scale bar is 20 μm.

The mCherryEA sensor showed excellent mitochondrial
targeting when co-expressed, and therefore we next studied the metabolism-dependent
pH changes in a neuroblastoma cell line using well-established inhibitors
for glycolytic and oxidative phosphorylation pathways.47,48

Metabolism-Dependent pH Dynamics
Metabolism and pH are strongly
coupled, with perturbations in the metabolic pathway known to cause
pH changes.1,48 In cancer cells, increased glycolytic
activity is known to cause acidification of tumor extracellular environment
and alkalinization of the cytosol.10,12,49 Recent studies have also implicated a link between
organelle pH and oncogenic signaling.50,51 For example,
Kondapalli et al. report increased luminal pH due to mutations in
Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE9) in patient glioblastomas.13 However, studies on compartment-specific pH
changes in neuroblastoma due to metabolic changes are lacking.

To investigate this with our dual sensor imaging strategy, we studied
pH changes in the Neuro2A mouse neuroblastoma cell line coexpressing
ratiometric-pHluorin and mitochondria-targeted mCherryEA (Figures 6A–C and S-9). Cells were grown in the presence of glucose
or in the absence of glucose, using galactose-supplemented media.52 Cells were then imaged during sequential treatment
with metabolic inhibitors to reveal pH changes linked to glycolysis
versus mitochondrial respiration. To inhibit glycolysis, the cells
were first exposed to iodoacetic acid (IAA). IAA inhibits the glycolytic
enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and is frequently
used to inhibit glycolysis in a variety of cell types, including Neuro2A
cells, as determined by measurement of ATP, reduced nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide, and other metabolic parameters.30,53−57 To next inhibit mitochondrial electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation,
cells were exposed to a combination of the mitochondrial membrane
ionophore, carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone
(FCCP), and the ATP synthase inhibitor, oligomycin.58−60

Figure 6 Metabolic inhibition
causes differential acidification in the cytosol vs mitochondria.
(A) Representative overlay image showing Neuro2A cells expressing
cytosolic ratiometric-pHluorin and mitochondria mCherryEA. (B) Average
pH change over time in the cytosol (green, dashed) and mitochondria
(red). Treatment with the glycolytic inhibitor 1 mM iodoacetic acid
(IAA) caused minor acidification in the cytosol with significant difference
in the ratio before and after addition of IAA in individual cells.
Although, no acidification was detected in mitochondria (asterisks)
for the population, two of the three cells showed significant decrease.
Treatment with the mitochondrial inhibitors 5 μM oligomycin
and 1 μM FCCP (O/F) caused acidification in both compartments,
and in particular, the cytosol exhibited large acidification. (D–F)
The metabolism-dependent pH dynamics were independent of the sensor.
(D) Representative overlay image showing Neuro2A cells expressing
cytosolic mCherryEA and mitochondrial ratiometric-pHluorin. (E, F)
Similar pH dynamics were observed when the localization of mCherryEA
and ratiometric-pHluorin was switched. The sensors were validated
at the end of the experiment by adding 30 mM NH4Cl and
10 mM acetic acid (n = 3, 30 cells total). Error
bars are std. Scale bar is 10 μm. mCherryEA (red, λex = 575 nm, λem = 632 nm). ratiometric-pHluorin
(green, λex = 475 nm, λem = 525
nm).

As expected, metabolic inhibition
with 1 mM IAA caused a small decrease in pH in the cytosol, which
is consistent with glycolytic inhibition. Although the pH change before
(ratio = 1.39 ± 0.04, mean ± std, n = 3)
and after (ratio = 1.48 ± 0.05) IAA addition is not significant
for the population average (p = 0.28, n = 3), the pH change is significant (p < 0.05)
in the cytosol of individual cells, highlighting the power of single-cell
analysis to reveal differences obscured by ensemble means. The pH
change in the mitochondria before (ratio = 0.90 ± 0.04) and after
(ratio = 0.90 ± 0.02) IAA addition was not significant (p = 0.80) for the population average (n = 3), but two cells show significant pH decreases (p ≤ 0.015) (Figure 6B,C). Further calibration would be required to compare the
difference in responses between the compartments, but we were clearly
able to observe relative pH changes in each compartment. Subsequent
treatment with 1 μM FCCP and 5 μM oligomycin (O/F) blocked
oxidative phosphorylation and caused further acidification in the
cytosol (before O/F ratio = 1.48 ± 0.05; after O/F ratio = 2.08
± 0.17, p = 0.06, n = 3) and
also in mitochondria (before O/F ratio = 0.90 ± 0.02; after O/F
ratio = 1.07 ± 0.05, p = 0.02, n = 3). Individual cells showed a significant decrease in pH in both
the compartments (p < 0.001). Although blocking
the ATP synthase with oligomycin alone would increase mitochondrial
pH, the presence of FCCP causes coupling between mitochondrial and
cytosolic pH resulting in acidification of the mitochondria. Interestingly,
the metabolism-dependent pH dynamics may be dependent on glycogen
stores, fatty acid supply, or gluconeogenic amino acid supply because
IAA also caused acidification when glucose is replaced with galactose.52 The IAA-dependent acidification during galactose
replacement indicates that extracellular glucose supply is not strictly
required for the effect (Figure S-9). However,
future metabolic studies will be needed to explore this further.

Importantly, the compartment-specific differences in pH dynamics
are consistent with the compartmentation of metabolic processes and
we validated that our observations are not an artifact of the sensors
themselves. To do this, we switched the localization of the two sensors,
now expressing mCherryEA in the cytosol and ratiometric-pHluorin in
the mitochondria. We again observed that FCCP and oligomycin treatment
caused the greatest change in pH of the cytosol and of the mitochondria
compared with IAA treatment, confirming that the compartment-specific
pH dynamics are independent of the specific sensor (Figure 6D–F). We cannot interpret
the difference between cytosol and mitochondria dynamics because of
the dampened dynamic range in mitochondria, but in the future, additional
pH calibration of the sensor in mitochondria and other organelles
will enable compartment-specific differences in pH dynamics to be
quantified with respect to the physiological process under study.

These studies show the mCherryEA sensor can be used simultaneously
with ratiometric-pHluorin to monitor coupled pH changes in two compartments.
In addition, the mCherryEA mutant, a ratiometric red pH sensor with
a pKa of 7.3, is well suited for quantitative
imaging in neutral to alkaline organelles, such as cytosol (pH 7.2),
endoplasmic reticulum (pH 7.2), mitochondria (pH 8), and peroxisome
(pH 7).61

Discussion and Conclusions
We demonstrated here that mCherryEA is a ratiometric red fluorescent
pH sensor that adds to the current toolbox of genetically encoded
indicators available for multicolor live-cell imaging. An excitation
ratiometric sensor exhibits two peaks in its fluorescence excitation
spectrum, and for fluorescent protein-based sensors, the peaks are
characteristic of the ionization states of the chromophore. The I158E/Q160A
mutant of mCherry was originally engineered by Piatkevich et al. to
shift the ionization state of the chromophore from the deprotonated
to protonated form to generate a long Stokes shift (LSS) mutant.25 Structural analysis indicated that an aspartate
or glutamate at residue 160 could facilitate excited-state proton
transfer (ESPT), and therefore the I160E mutation was made to create
a proton-relay network between S158, E160, and the hydroxyl group
of the chromophore.25 ESPT mutants have
been similarly engineered for LSS mutants of mCherry and other RFPs.25,62 Piatkevich et al. also showed that the E160 interacts with solvent
protons,25 and we showed here that this
interaction makes it a suitable solvent pH sensor. In a similar manner,
pHluorin was engineered using the S202H mutation in wild-type green
fluorescent protein (GFP). Although wild-type GFP exhibits excitation
peaks characteristic of the protonated and deprotonated states, it
does not exhibit a ratiometric shift in ionization in response to
pH changes. Like the engineered glutamate in mCherryEA, the residue
S202, which is involved in the proton-relay network, was mutated to
histidine (pKa = 6.0) in pHluorin to increase
its sensitivity to solvent pH. Thus, our work characterizing mCherryEA
highlights the utility of engineering ESPT mutants of RFPs to generate
new pH sensors.

Interestingly, in our characterization of mCherryEA,
we found that despite the low quantum yield and extinction coefficient
measured from the purified protein, the brightness of mCherryEA expressed
in live cells was comparable to that of pHRed under same imaging conditions.
Similar photophysical and photochemical differences between solution
studies versus live-cell studies have been observed for other fluorescent
protein biosensors, but the exact causes are not well understood.27,28 We then compared the pH sensing characteristics of mCherryEA to
that of two other single fluorescent protein-based pH sensors. We
found that mCherryEA has a more alkaline pKa of 7.3 compared to that of both ratiometric-pHluorin and pHRed,
making mCherryEA useful for monitoring pH changes in neutral to alkaline
compartments. We also found that the dynamic range for mCherryEA (4-fold
change) is comparable to that for ratiometric-pHluorin and several
commonly used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) sensors,
such as AKAR, EKAR, and JNKAR, which show 1.2–2-fold change
in cells.63−65 In the future, further mutagenesis could help improve
the dynamic range of mCherryEA to be comparable to that of the multidomain
green fluorescent pH sensor SypHer (10-fold change)17,27 (Figure S-2) and other FRET-based sensors
such as the calcium sensor Twitch (4–10-fold change).66

A major contribution of mCherryEA is to
enable multicolor live-cell imaging because it is red fluorescent
and should be compatible with green fluorescent sensors. As a proof-of-concept,
we simultaneously imaged mCherryEA and ratiometric-pHluorin in different
compartments in live neurons and neuroblastoma cells. We demonstrated
that the negligible spectral cross talk between mCherryEA and ratiometric-pHluorin
makes it possible to measure pH changes in the cytosol and mitochondria
of the same cell. We observed relative changes in compartment-specific
pH that correlated with neuronal activity and metabolic inhibition.
However, because the sensors show decreased dynamic range in mitochondria,
we could not directly compare the differences in pH between compartments.
To compare pH changes between organelles, it is necessary to carry
out an in situ pH calibration at the end of each experiment on a cell-by-cell
basis, as demonstrated by Poburko et al. for example.17 We demonstrate that in situ calibrations can be done with
cytosolic or mitochondrial-targeted mCherryEA using nigericin and
monensin. However, we also found that nigericin and monensin can cause
extensive cell death after long metabolic manipulations or with primary
neuron cultures, precluding our ability to carry out in situ calibrations
in some scenarios. In the absence of calibrated measurements, mCherryEA
can still be used to observe relative changes in pH within a compartment.

In conclusion, we demonstrated that the mCherryEA mutant is a red
fluorescent, ratiometric pH sensor with pKa of 7.3, which is more alkaline than other red fluorescent pH sensors
such as pHRed. It can be used to measure compartment-specific pH changes
simultaneously with green fluorescent pH sensors such as ratiometric-pHluorin
in several different cell types, and in principle, it is spectrally
compatible with sensors of other analytes that utilize blue, cyan,
green, or yellow fluorescent proteins.

Molecular Biology
pRSETb-mCherry(wt) and GW1-mCherry(wt)
were mutated using the NEB Q5 site-directed mutagenesis kit to generate
the mCherry(I158E/Q160A) mutant. Mitochondria-targeted mCherryEA was
cloned by fusing a tandem 4xCoxVIII signal sequence67 to the N-terminus. GW1-ratiometric-pHluorin and GW1-SypHer
were generated by subcloning ratiometric-pHluorin from VV064: 1xCox8-ratiometric-pHluorin
and SypHer from SypHer-mt into GW1 vector using NEB HiFi reactions.
VV064: 1xCox8-ratiometric-pHluorin in the FCK vector was a gift from
Adam Cohen (Addgene plasmid # 58502), and SypHer-mt was a gift from
Nicolas Demaurex (Addgene plasmid # 48251).

Protein Expression and
Purification
pRSETb-mCherryEA was transformed into BL21(DE3)
cells and grown in 500 mL of autoinduction media (ForMedium) at 37
°C overnight and transferred to 4 °C for 3 days. Protein
was purified using HisTrap Nickel columns (GE Healthcare) according
to manufacturer instructions. Purified protein was dialyzed into storage
solution (5 mM 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid
(MOPS), 150 mM NaCl, and 5% glycerol, pH 7.4) and stored at −80
°C.

Steady-State Fluorescence Spectroscopy
pH titration
was performed in solutions containing 10 mM each of Bis-Tris, MOPS,
and Tris plus 100 mM NaCl adjusted to pH values ranging from 5.5 to
9. Protein samples were diluted to 1–2 μM, and fluorescence
was measured in a microplate reader (BioTek Synergy H5). The excitation
spectrum was measured using a monochromator set to scan from 350 to
600 nm, with emission set at 630 nm. The fluorescence was normalized
by calculating the ratio of excitation peaks at 585 by 450 nm. To
test for environmental interference, the mutants were titrated in
buffered solutions containing either 100 mM NaCl, KCl, or K-gluconate
and the addition of 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2,
1 mM H2O2, and 3 mM DTT. For temperature dependence,
the fluorescence measurement was taken with the reader set to 23,
25, 31, and 37 °C.

Cell Culture and Transfections
Neuro2A
(ATCC CCL-131) and HEK-293 (ATCC CRL-1573) cells were cultured at
37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified air incubator in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) media containing 10% cosmic
calf serum (HyClone). Cells were transfected using Effectene (Qiagen)
as per manufacturer’s instructions and imaged after 2 days.

Neuron and Astrocyte Cultures
All animal procedures were
performed in strict accordance with recommendations provided in the
National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals, according to protocols approved by the Purdue Animal Care
and Use Committee and the Purdue University Laboratory Animal Program
to minimize pain and suffering. Cortical and hippocampal neurons were
isolated from P0 mice and maintained in Neurobasal media supplemented
with 5–25 mM glucose, 0.2 mM pyruvate, 0.5 mM GlutaMAX, B-27,
penicillin, and streptomycin (Pen/Strep). Neurons were transfected
after 7–9 days using calcium phosphate method.68 Cortical astrocytes were isolated from P0 to P4 mice and
maintained in DMEM/F12 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
and Pen/Strep. Astrocytes were transfected using Lipofectamine 3000
(Invitrogen), as per manufacturer’s instructions.

Extinction
Coefficient (ε) and Quantum Yield (QY)
The concentration
of protein containing mature chromophore was quantified by measuring
the absorbance of the protein in 1 M NaOH at 450 nm (ε: 44 000
M–1 cm–1), as previously described.18 Twenty-eight percent of purified mCherryEA corresponded
to mature chromophore. The concentration from alkaline denaturation
method was used for ε and QY measurements. For ε measurement,
absorbance and fluorescence spectra of the protein at dilutions of
5–20 μM were measured. The ε was calculated according
to the Beer–Lambert equation. For QY measurement, slopes from
absorbance versus fluorescence at different pH were measured with
wild-type mCherry as the standard for excitation at 530 nm (QY = 0.22).
QY at 440 nm was calculated relative to 530 nm QY.

Sensor Characterization
in Live Cells
NH4Cl: pH response of the sensors in live cells was tested by adding 10 mM NH4Cl to the imaging solution (mM: 15 N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), 1.25 NaH2PO4, 10 glucose, 120 NaCl, 3 KCl, 2 CaCl2,
1 MgCl2, and 3 NaHCO3, pH 7.3). Cytosol pH calibration:
Neuro2A cells transfected with mCherryEA or ratiometric-pHluorin were
seeded in a multiwell plate and exposed to different pH ranging from
5.5 to 9 in a high-potassium solution (mM: 15 HEPES, 1.25 KH2PO4, 10 glucose, 123 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, pH 7.3) in the presence of 2–5 μM nigericin.22,27,60 Mitochondria pH calibration:
Neuro2A cells transfected with mito-mCherryEA or mito-pHluorin seeded
in a multiwell plate were exposed to pH 5.5–9 in a high-potassium
solution (mM: 15 HEPES, 10 glucose, 123 KCl, 20 NaCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2) in the presence of 5 μg/mL nigericin
and 5 μM monensin. For individual cell calibration, Neuro2A
cells were treated with 10 mM NH4Cl. After washing the cells with
imaging solution, a three-point calibration was performed with high-potassium
solutions buffered at pH 6.0, 7.5, and 8.0.

Live-Cell Imaging
Cells were imaged using an Olympus IX83 fluorescence microscope with
a 20×/0.75 NA and 60×/1.35 oil objective illuminated by
a Lumencor SpectraX light engine and equipped with an Andor Zyla 4.2
sCMOS camera. Lumencor power levels were typically set at 5–10%
for each ratio channel for cytosolic sensor and 15–30% for
mitochondrial sensor. mCherryEA and pHRed were excited using 575/25
and 438/29 nm band-pass filters, and emission was collected through
a 632/60 nm band-pass filter. Ratiometric-pHluorin was excited using
475/34 and 395/25 nm band-pass filters, and emission was collected
through a 525/50 nm band-pass filter. SypHer was excited using 475/34
and 438/29 nm band-pass filters, and emission was collected through
a 525/50 nm band-pass filter. The exposure time was set between 50
and 200 ms for all experiments, and fluorescence signals were at least
3-fold above the background in all fluorescence channels. For mCherryEA
and pHRed comparison, cells expressing each sensor were imaged on
the same days under the exact same illumination and imaging conditions
(exposure times, light-emitting diode power, etc.). Neurons were perfused
at 1 mL/min with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (mM: 15 HEPES, 120
NaCl, 3 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 3 NaHCO3, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 5 glucose, 0.2 pyruvate, and
0.5 glutamax, pH 7.4). To confirm targeting of GW1-4xCox8-mCherryEA,
10 nM MitoTracker Deep Red (Invitrogen) was added to Neuro2A cells
expressing mito-mCherryEA and treated as per manufacturer’s
instruction. High-magnification images were captured using the 60×/1.35
oil objective. MitoTracker Deep Red was excited using 631/28 nm band-pass
filter and emission was collected through a ET706/95 nm band-pass
filter.

Data Analysis
Images were acquired with IQ (Andor)
and analyzed with ImageJ. The mean and background intensities were
measured for the images. The ratio was calculated by dividing the
background-subtracted means of images excited at the higher wavelength
by the lower wavelength. For pixel-by-pixel measurement, fluorescence
images were background-subtracted and a threshold was set to reject
background pixels. Ratio images were obtained by dividing the images
captured by exciting at the higher and the lower excitation wavelengths.
