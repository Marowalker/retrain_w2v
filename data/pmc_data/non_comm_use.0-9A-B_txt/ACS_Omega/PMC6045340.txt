Protein scaffolds
have proven useful for co-localization of enzymes, providing control
over stoichiometry and leading to higher local enzyme concentrations,
which have led to improved product formation. To broaden their usefulness,
it is necessary to have a wide choice of building blocks to mix and
match for scaffold generation. Ideally, the scaffold building blocks
should function at any location within the scaffold and have high
affinity interactions with their binding partners. We examined the
utility of orthogonal synthetic coiled coils (zippers) as scaffold
components. The orthogonal zippers are coiled coil domains that form
heterodimers only with their specific partner and not with other zipper
domains. Focusing on two orthogonal zipper pairs, we demonstrated
that they are able to function on either end or in the middle of a
multiblock assembly. Surface plasmon resonance was employed to assess
the binding kinetics of zipper pairs placed at the start, middle,
or end of a construct. Size-exclusion chromatography was used to demonstrate
the ability of a scaffold with two zipper domains to bind their partners
simultaneously. We then expanded the study to examine the binding
kinetics and cross-reactivities of three additional zipper pairs.
By validating the affinities and specificities of synthetic zipper
pairs, we demonstrated the potential for zipper domains to provide
an expanded library of scaffolding parts for tethering enzymes in
complex pathways for synthetic biology applications.

Introduction
The use of scaffolds
for pathway organization is a promising synthetic
biology approach that co-localizes functional proteins of the same
pathway to provide programmable control over parameters such as enzyme
stoichiometry.1−5 This approach has the potential to yield improved product production,
as it serves to physically enrich the local concentration of enzymes
and substrates, which may be especially beneficial for multienzyme
cascades. The most successful protein-based scaffolds have been built
from modular protein–protein interaction domains connected
by peptide linkers. Enzymes were expressed as fusions with interaction
partners that self-assembled onto the scaffold. The number of repeats
of an interaction domain on the scaffold controls the stoichiometry,
and the use of multiple interaction domains facilitates the incorporation
of various enzymes. In one example, a 77-fold increase in mevalonate
biosynthesis was realized through scaffolding of three enzymes.4 To be scalable, a wide variety of binding domains
with tight affinity and high specificity need to be available for
scaffold construction. Ideally the building blocks should be able
to function on either end or in the middle of a scaffold construct.

To date, most of the work has utilized metazoan signaling proteins
(SH3-, PDZ-, and GBD-binding domain) or cohesin domains as scaffold
components.4,6,7 Other systems,
such as tetratricopeptide repeat affinity protein–peptide interaction
domains have been proposed as alternate interaction modules.8 These components are useful; however, the interactions
of the aforementioned domains are typically in the micromolar range.8,9 Ideally, researchers would benefit from a wide variety of scaffolding/interaction
domains with a range of affinities.

Coiled coil domains (zippers)
offer additional scaffold components.
These domains offer good affinity, tunable from the micromolar down
to sub-nanomolar.10 Until recently, researchers
did not have access to a large set of coiled coils with specific and
predictable interactions. Now, however, several groups have described
sets of designed synthetic orthogonal zippers.11−14 The availability of a variety
of orthogonal zippers has wide ranging applications from use in synthetic
biology to the design of non-natural protein structures such as tetrahedral
protein cages.15,16 The motivation behind our work
was to investigate the ability of these synthetic zipper domains to
function as building blocks for protein scaffolds.

We initially
focused on two pairs of SYNZIP designed coiled coil
domains first described by the Keating laboratory (SYZNIPs 1 and 2
and SYNZIPs 3 and 4) known to be orthogonal.12,17 Orthogonal zipper domains form interactions only with their partners;
in this case, SYNZIP 1 with 2 and SYNZIP 3 with 4. To gain the most
utility, the scaffold building blocks must retain their binding function
when expressed at either end or within the middle of the scaffold
assembly. Each zipper was constructed as a Bglbrick part18 for facile mixing of parts. The zippers were
fused to single-domain antibody (sdAb) domains19,20 to facilitate protein production and characterization. Binding affinities
for the zipper pairs were measured using surface plasmon resonance
(SPR), and size-exclusion chromatography was utilized to demonstrate
the ability of a scaffold with two zippers to bind their partners
simultaneously. We expanded our investigation using surface plasmon
resonance to examine the interactions of two additional pairs of SYNZIP
designed zippers,12,17 as well as a heterodimerizing
pair consisting of a basic and an acidic zipper derived from a eukaryotic
protein.21

This study demonstrated
that the synthetic zippers maintained their
function when placed at different locations in a multidomain construct
substantiating their promise as domains for use in the scaffolding
of enzymes. In addition, this work confirmed the original binding
and specificity data reported by the group that produced the SYNZIP
proteins. The availability of validated protein building blocks (parts)
with well-characterized interactions is beneficial for a variety of
synthetic biology applications.22

Results
and Discussion
Our work started by evaluating two pairs of
synthetic zippers.
The constructs were assembled using the Bglbrick cloning strategy,18 where each was a combination of a single-domain
antibody (sdAb) domain19,20 and one or two SYNZIP domains.12,17 Each domain was separated by a 12–15 amino acid long linker.
Two series of constructs were built. The first included a ricin-binding
sdAb, referred to here as D (originally termed D12fneg23), produced as a C-terminal fusion with individual
SYNZIPs (1, 2, 3, and 4) and SYNZIP domain pairs (1, 3 and 3, 1).
The second set consisted of a staphylococcal enterotoxin B-binding
sdAb (ACVE,24 referred here as A) in combinations
with each of the SYNZIPs (1, 2, 3, and 4) expressed at the C-terminal,
SYNZIPs 1, 3, and 4 at the N-terminal, and SYNZIP 1 sandwiched between
two A domains. The constructs were designated by abbreviating the
domains in the order they occurred using the letter designation of
the sdAb and the number of the SYNZIP. Figure 1 shows a schematic overview of each of the
initial constructs. All of the protein sequences are provided in the
Supporting Information (Figure S1). Figure 1 also presents the
cartoon depictions of several of the interactions expected between
the zipper pairs within the constructs.

Figure 1 List of SYNZIP constructs
assembled to examine the ability of the
zippers to function at the C-terminus, N-terminus, or interior of
a multidomain protein. A schematic is shown for each construct along
with cartoons of some of the interactions that we characterized.

SdAb contain a conserved disulfide
bond making periplasmic expression
preferred, thus all the sdAb-SYNZIP fusions were expressed in the
periplasm. Each construct was found to have a protein expression of
at least 1 mg/L, with the C-terminal fusions producing ∼9–20
mg/L. Each construct was prepared at least twice; the average protein
yields along with the average deviation are summarized in Table 1. Interestingly the
C-terminal fusions with A produced at least 5 times better than the
N-terminal fusions, and the construct with a SYNZIP sandwiched between
two A domains. However, this might be particular to this sdAb and
not a general feature of the SYNZIP domains. The scaffolds containing
the D sdAb and two SYNZIPs produced ∼10–12 mg/L.

Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was
used to measure the binding
kinetics of the SYNZIP interactions and verify their specificity.
The BioRad ProteOn XPR36 enabled simultaneous interrogation of six
immobilized sdAb-SNYZIP constructs with five concentrations of an
sdAb-SYNZIP-based construct in solution. Oriented immobilization of
the fused SYNZIP was provided through the interaction of the D sdAb
with ricin covalently attached to the chip; a cartoon of the experiment
is shown in Figure S2 of the Supporting
Information. The D sdAb binds to ricin with a very high affinity (equilibrium
dissociation constant (KD) = 0.04 nM),23 which allowed us to evaluate accurately the
affinity of the SYNZIP pairs. The SPR results are summarized in Tables 2 and 3. Table 2 provides
the KD for each interacting pair, whereas Table 3 includes ka and kd, the measured
on and off rate constants. An example set of the SPR data is shown
in Figure 2; other
data sets are presented in the Supporting Information (Figure S3). Previously, the affinity of the SYNZIP
1–2 and 3–4 pairs had been reported as <10 and <30
nM, respectively.17 Our results measured
by SPR are in general agreement with the earlier reports. Critical
for their potential use in scaffolding schemes, our work verifies
that the SYNZIP 1–2 and 3–4 interactions are specific
and demonstrated that the SYNZIP domains are able to specifically
recognize their partner when incorporated at the start, middle, or
end of a fusion protein.

Figure 2 Representative SPR data. D-1, D-2, D-3, D-4,
D-1-3, and D-3-1 were
immobilized on six individual columns of the SPR chip. Dilutions of
the A-1 construct (300, 100, 33, 11, 3.7, and 0 nM) were flowed over
the chip in rows and are noted to the right of each trace. Data are
presented for binding of A-1 to each of the six immobilized D-SYNZIP
constructs.

It is imperative that the domains of a scaffold can
bind their
partners simultaneously. Size-exclusion chromatography was employed
to address this question. Results are shown in Figure 3 (also in the Supporting Information, Figure S4). No assembly was observed with the
control constructs (A-1 and A-3 with a D-1-3 or D-3-1 scaffold; Figure S4), as judged by the fact that the profile
of the combinations was essentially the sum of the profile of the
individual components. As shown in Figure 3, when D-3-1 is combined with A-2 or A-4,
the combined peak runs at a smaller volume, indicating that D-3-1
is able to bind both the SYNZIP 2- and 4-based partner constructs.
The combined D-3-1, A-2, and A-4 sample elutes at a smaller volume
than any of the components or partial combinations, clearly implying
that both A-2 and A-4 are able to bind simultaneously to the scaffold
and maintain that interaction during the course of the gel filtration
run. Interestingly, the combined D-1-3, A-2, and A-4 sample runs at
only a slightly smaller volume than the combined D-1-3 and A-4 peak
(13.2026 mL vs 13.3159 mL; Figure S4).
As with the D-3-1 scaffold, however, the three-component mix ran primarily
as one peak with ∼3 times the height as the individual components.
This indicates that the A-2 and A-4 are assembling simultaneously
on the D-1-3 scaffold.

Figure 3 Size-exclusion chromatography. Each component was run
separately
and then A-2 and A-4 were run in combination with the D-3-1 scaffold.
The concentration of each protein was held constant for every experiment.

Next, we produced three additional
zipper pairs and measured their
binding affinities and cross-reactivities. Four of the zippers were
SYNZIPs (5, 6, 17, and 18) that form 2 additional pairs: 5 with 6
and 17 with 18.17 Unlike the other pairs,
17 and 18 were previously shown to interact in an antiparallel orientation.
Each new zipper was cloned to the C-terminus of the A or D sdAb. As
with the other SYNZIPs, new constructs had excellent protein yields
ranging from ∼4 to 25 mg/L (Table S1, Supporting Information). In addition to the SYNZIPs, we produced
an acidic and basic zipper pair (R34m and E34m) derived from the B-Zip
domain of the chicken transcription factor VBP that has been characterized
and utilized in synthetic biology applications as dimer-forming domains.21,22,25 The original acidic and basic
zipper sequences each contain a single cysteine. In an effort to avoid
the zippers forming disulfide bonds when expressed as sdAb fusions
in the periplasm, we mutated the cysteines to serines. Fusions with
the E34m zipper produced well (∼13–23 mg/L); however,
those with the positively charged R34m zipper had poor protein yields
(∼1 mg/L). This is consistent with poor protein expression
we had previously obtained for a fusion of an sdAb to a similar positively
charged zipper.26

Each of the six
additional zippers was immobilized to a chip for
SPR analysis. We examined the ability of all 10 zippers to bind, providing
information on both affinity and specificity. The binding data are
summarized in Table 4, and the kinetics are shown in Table 5. In several cases, weak binding interactions were
observed; for example, A-5 has a weak interaction with D-18. In general,
the SYNZIP binding affinities observed agreed with what had previously
been reported (<15 nM for the 5–6 pair and <10 nM for
17–18 pair).17 The previous characterization
of the SYNZIP domains also indicated some cross-reactivity that is
consistent with our observations.12,17 Likewise,
the E34m–R34m interaction was close to the value of 6 nM that
had been previously reported.25

Both the R34m and SYNZIP 17 zippers
were found to be “sticky”,
giving a signal on every spot when employing the running buffer used
in the binding measurements of the first sets of zippers. Examining
the sequences showed that both zippers have five or six more Arg/Lys
residues than Glu/Asp. Other zippers had either one additional Arg/Lys
or slightly more Glu/Asp (Table S2, Supporting
Information). Adding 5 mM MgSO4 to the running buffer eliminated
most of the nonspecific interactions while preserving the specific
binding of the zipper pairs.

The new zipper constructs were
also examined by SPR for their ability
to bind to immobilized SYNZIP 1, 2, 3, and 4. The samples were run
in buffer with added BSA and MgSO4. No interactions were
observed with the exception of SYNZIP 17, which appeared to bind to
2 and 3. This may be due to the sticky nature of the positively charged
SYNZIP 17. No binding, however, was observed with the positively charged
R34m zipper. The data are reported in Table S3 and Figure S5 in the Supporting Information.

In summation,
we demonstrated that the SYNZIPs can be used as effective
scaffolding domains, showing that they are able to function at either
end or in the middle of a construct. Next, we characterized three
other zipper pairs showing the potential for five orthogonal interacting
pairs. Our work serves, in part, as an independent verification of
the affinity and specificity of the SYNZIP constructs. The methods
demonstrated here are of value to evaluate other SYNZIP constructs,
or designed orthogonal coiled coil systems to ensure their functionality,
and thereby provide a wealth of validated high-affinity interaction
domains for synthetic biology and scaffolding applications.

Experimental
Section
Construction of Bglbrick Parts and Assembly of Constructs
Cloning enzymes were from New England Biolabs. The BglII site was removed from the pET22b vector using the quick change
mutagenesis kit (Agilent), and a Bglbrick compatible version of pET22b
termed pET22b-BglII was constructed.27 The DNA coding for each of the SYNZIP sequences12 was synthesized by Eurofins Genomics, with PCR
used to introduce linkers and restriction sites for Bglbrick cloning.18 Each sdAb was also cloned into pET22b-BglII. All the Bglbrick parts were constructed with C-terminal
Gly Ser linkers. The proteins were produced and purified as described
previously,23,24 with the exception that an Enrich
SEC 650 column was utilized for size-exclusion purification. Proteins,
in PBS containing 0.02% sodium azide, were quickly frozen in dry ice
and stored at −80 °C.

Surface Plasmon Resonance
SPR was performed as previously
described,23 with the exception that BSA
(1 mg/mL) was added to the standard running buffer of PBS with 0.005%
Tween-20. Briefly, ricin was immobilized onto every spot on the chip.
Next, each of the six D constructs was immobilized along one column.
Dilutions of A constructs in the running buffer, including a 0 nM
control, were flowed along each of the six rows. The first type of
chip contained D-1, D-2, D-3, D-4, D-1-3, and D-3-1, whereas a second
type of chip was immobilized with D-5, D-6, D-17, D-18, D-R34m, and
D-E34m. The first type of chip was prepared three separate times,
whereas the second type was made once. Only limited nonspecific binding
interaction was apparent between the initial constructs, it was not
until testing the A and D constructs on the second chip that nonspecific
binding became more obvious, thus both chips were run an additional
time using running buffer containing 1 mg/mL BSA and 5 mM MgSO4 to minimize these undesirable interactions. All of the interactions
were measured at least two times, some as many as six times. The data
were fit using a global analysis 1:1 Langmuir model with the standard
error always less than 10%, typically ∼1%; variation between
multiple tests of the same sample was within a factor of 2, and a
representative data set was used in the tables and shown in the Supporting Information.

Size-Exclusion Chromatography
The analysis was carried
out using a BioLogic DuoFLow chromatography system (Bio-Rad) with
an Enrich SEC 650 column. The samples were made up to 250 μL
with PBS. The protein concentrations (∼20 μM) were used
to generate a signal of around 45–50 mAU. The mixtures (∼20
μM each component) were incubated on the bench top at least
15 min before injecting.
