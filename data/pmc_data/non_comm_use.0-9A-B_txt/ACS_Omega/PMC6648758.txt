This short essay urges the community
of those who study electrocatalysis
and photocatalysis to report measures of the number of active sites
in heterogeneous catalysts (especially the redox sites in an electrocatalyst)
and the number of photons involved in photoconversions. An example
of the former is the use of CO stripping for catalysts containing
platinum-group metals and N2O titration to count redox
sites in supported electrocatalysts containing base metals that do
not strongly chemisorb CO or hydrogen. A minimal example of the latter
is to report energy density as a way to bridge between batch photolysis
and flow photoinitiated reactions.

==== Body
Introduction
Only about 1% of the contributions published
to date in ACS Omega
deal with heterogeneous catalysis, but they all touch forefront topics
in the conversion and storage of energy, particularly renewable energy,
new materials, and new reactors that enable effective electrochemical
and photochemical conversions. Evidently, these contributions have
met the scope of ACS Omega, which is to present new findings “without
any perceived evaluation of immediate impact.” This perspective
addresses ways to enhance the future appreciation and utility of the
information by encouraging the community, going forward, to tie the
findings to the number of catalytic sites and the intensity of the
process conditions, both of which are often under-reported.

Discussion
Site-Counting
Counting the sites that ostensibly confer
activity on heterogeneous catalysts, like all of metrology, requires
bootstrapping, an initial approximation followed by successive refinements
that define and realize the measurement and facilitate its traceability.1 The measurement is complicated by changes in,
indeed generation of, the sites during reaction. Methodological deficiencies,
uncertainties, and special reaction conditions notwithstanding, the
reporting of some measure of the number of sites permits better comparison
of results across laboratories because it provides an additional benchmark
for “homemade” catalysts, which can be difficult to
reproduce when synthesized at a small scale.2 The use of well-characterized reference catalysts may be inappropriate
because they are available only for a limited range of compositions3,4 and the whole point of the reported research may be to test a composition
or architecture that cannot be achieved by modifying an existing catalyst.

Unless the sites are uniform and 100% exposed, physical characterization
of the sites, via bulk-averaging techniques, e.g., spectroscopy, diffractometry,
or microscopy, will not necessarily correctly census them; the signature
of a minority population of rare, very active sites could be overwhelmed
by the signal from the majority species.

There is also no guarantee
that a molecular probe, for example,
titration, even one that uses a participant in the catalytic cycle,
will count the sites faithfully because with the exception of populating
an isotopically labeled pool5 or a “knockout”
protocol that incrementally poisons the sites,6 titration must be employed outside of the catalytic cycle, i.e.,
ex and not in operando. Steady-state isotopic transient analyses are
susceptible to error in the deconvolution of overlapping transients.
The method can, in principle, be applied to reactions involving condensed
media, but the high density of the intermediates may, again, impede
interpretation, particularly for species that can rapidly scramble
(e.g., surface- and solvent-bonded hydrogens). The knockout experiment
may count readily titrated but irrelevant sites. Finally, we note
that the stoichiometry of titration may be sensitive to the measurement
protocol7 so that, in general, one can
only count the sites on average or nominally.8

Such cavils, however, should not dissuade researchers from
attempting
to normalize rates. The normalization itself is a hypothesis that
needs to be reported to be disproved. Moreover, it provides further
characterization of the catalyst, which should be obligate for papers
published in ACS Omega because it assists future researchers who try
to reproduce prior work, particularly in domains like electrocatalysis
where the tradition of counting sites is not as strong as it is in
heterogeneous catalysis.

For example, titration using H29 systematized the activity of
a set of supported Pt electrocatalysts.
In that case, the electrically conductive carrier itself had sufficient
electrochemical activity to preclude the use of techniques (e.g.,
underpotential deposition) that serve well to estimate the electrochemically
active surface area of bulk metals.

Even when special attention
is paid to subtraction of background
currents,10,11 the use of techniques that can work well
for platinum-group metals, e.g., CO stripping or underpotential deposition
of a monolayer of hydrogen or another metal, can be problematic for
redox sites containing base metals that do not chemisorb CO or hydrogen
at convenient temperatures. For this reason, to count the redox sites
in a carbon-supported copper electrocatalyst, we adapted titration
that uses N2O to gently deposit a monolayer of oxygen on
the surface of the metal.12 Electrochemical
stripping of the adsorbed O then counted the sites. We believe, but
have not yet shown, that the technique could be used for any reduced
metal that dissociatively adsorbs N2O (Figure 1).13

Figure 1 Elements
likely susceptible to site-counting by N2O
titration followed by electrochemical stripping of the deposited O.

An alternative to titrating sites
stoichiometrically would be to
compare the measured rate of the reaction under study to that of a
fiducial reaction, one whose rate per site has only a small variability
between bulk catalysts (whose surface structure can, in principle,
be determined through physical measurements) and supported catalysts.
In the case of metals, any structure-insensitive reaction14 should serve as a fiducial reaction for any
other structure-insensitive reaction.15

For electrochemical reductions, the electrochemically activated
evolution of hydrogen16 might serve as
a first guess at a fiducial reaction for other electrochemical reductions,
for example, the electrochemically activated removal of heteroatoms.17 The variation of surface geometry with particle
size can be calculated for compact, simply faceted particles,18,19 and the exchange current density has been measured for some metals,
for example, the low-index facets of Pt16 (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Estimation
of the exchange current density of small, compact, faceted
particles of Pt using literature values for facet population densities19 and exchange current densities for low-index
planes of the metal.16

In the case of metal oxides, the oxidation of methanol appears
to serve well as a fiducial reaction because it has been shown20 to track with the number of M1–O–M2 moieties that comprise the active sites for alcohol oxidations.

Photon Counting
When the source of illumination is
monochromatic and tightly coupled to the reactor, it can suffice to
report lamp power as a surrogate for the input flux of photons in
photoconversion. For example, we have shown that photoactivated trifluoromethylation
of substituted arenes, in batch21 and flow
reactors,22 tracks with the density of
the photon energy admitted to the reactor (Figure 3). In the case of the batch reactor, the
energy density is the power of the lamp multiplied by the duration
of the experiment and divided by the volume of the illuminated solution.
In the case of the flow reactor, the energy density is the power of
the lamp divided by the flow rate of the solution.

Figure 3 Yield of photoactivated
trifluoromethylation of substituted arenes21 can track with lamp power in both batch and
flow reactors.

That sort of correlation
is convenient but does not afford the
same level of insight as would knowing the quantum yield of the conversion.
For example, photoconversions exhibit quantum yields, Φ, that
can be less than unity, when the energy of the photon is dissipated
before it affects the desired reaction, or greater than unity, when
the photon initiates a chain reaction. In either case, it is good
to know the value of Φ both to explain the chemistry and to
compare the conversion efficiency to other ways of deploying the photons.
Moreover, lamps age and the coupling of the source to the experiment
may incur losses. Therefore, it is far more instructive to report
some measure of the utilization of the photons that have arrived,
for example, through the results of an actinometric assay, rather
than merely reporting the nameplate power of the illumination source.
Several assays are available,23 including
wet assays, which are suitable for flow photochemistry, and solid-state
actinometers, which may be more convenient for testing photovoltaic
devices.

Conclusions and Outlook
Reviewers,
readers, and editors of ACS Omega would certainly object
if an experimental procedure only described the use of “some”
catalyst, either “some type” or “some amount”.
Description of the type of a catalyst is rarely omitted, but the omission
of information about the number of catalytic sites is common.

Similarly, the heating of a sample described only by the wattage
of the oven would raise objections. The addition of thermal energy
is almost always quantified by reporting the temperature of the sample.
However, the addition of photoenergy is rarely accompanied by reproducible
specification of the number or flux of photons or the quantum yield
of the conversion.

Adding those details, even approximately
or imperfectly, will surely
enhance the archival value of contributions dealing with catalysis,
especially electrocatalysis and photocatalysis, by equipping future
readers with metrics that can be used to quantify progress in the
understanding and utilization of the materials and energy involved
in the targeted chemical processes.

Intrinsic, normalized rates
of catalytic conversions and photon
conversions should depend on the molecular scale chemistry and imposed
reaction conditions. Establishing normalized rates is a first step
toward detecting (and perhaps diagnosing) scale-dependent phenomena
that interfere with comparisons between laboratories and that can
mask underlying trends in the targeted chemistry.24
