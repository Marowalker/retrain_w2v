Herein, we present a water-soluble
dendritric Pt(II) complex as
a phosphorescent label for bacterial cells. The dendritic moiety endows
the Pt(II) complex with unique properties such as water solubility,
shielding from quenching by dioxygen, and binding to bacterial surfaces.
The new biosensor was employed for two-photon excitation microscopy,
and the binding was confirmed by electron microscopy, which demonstrates
that such hybrid arrays can provide orthogonal yet complementary readouts.

Introduction
The luminescence properties
of platinum(II) complexes have attracted
considerable attention in the last decade, due to their potential
application in the field of bioimaging.1 The versatility of Pt(II) complexes lies in the tunability of their
luminescence to blue, green, red, or white by tailored ligand design,2−5 their photostability, and their significant Stokes shift.6 Moreover, the ability of Pt(II) complexes to
emit upon two-photon excitation (TPE) affords the possibility of in
vivo imaging in tissues.7 However, despite
these qualities, their application in the field of bioimaging is still
limited due to solubility and quenching phenomena in aqueous environments.

Pt(II) complexes possess square-planar coordination geometries
that favor strong axial interactions. Therefore, most of them interact
face-to-face, stacking into aggregates. This in turn leads to broad
red-shifted emission bands. The excimeric luminescence from aggregates
is attributed to metal-metal-to-ligand charge transfer states (3MMLCT), whereas monomeric species emit from triplet ligand-centered
(3LC) excited states with sizeable metal-to-ligand charge
transfer (3MLCT) character.8 This metal-perturbed ligand-centered (3MP-LC) luminescence
is usually quenched by triplet dioxygen in solution (3O2), leading to shortened emission lifetimes, reduced luminescence
intensities and reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as singlet dioxygen
(1O2).9 Even if useful
for photodynamic therapy (PDT), the photoproduction of ROS can be
detrimental for optical imaging, where high luminescence intensities
are necessitated and cytotoxicity is to be avoided.10 Thus, it is necessary to suppress diffusional quenching
by shielding the luminophoric complex. Adequate ligands surrounding
the metal center can control the alignment of the core and tune π–π
staking in solution or in solid media, where the formation of aggregates
can be favored or hindered on demand.11,12

We have
recently reported on compact clusters of Pt(II) complexes
adsorbed at the interface of bovine serum albumin, which are intrinsically
shielded from molecular oxygen that allows a time-gated separation
of their phosphorescence from background autofluorescence. While these
clusters can even act as donors in energy transfer processes, the
free monomeric species in solution are nonemissive.13 Moreover, we have shown that self-assembled micelles based
on tailored copolymers doped with Pt(II) complexes can be tracked
by optical and electron microscopy, due to their oxygen-insensitive
luminescence and contrast enabled by the high atomic number. The resulting
dual readout was employed to track their uptake and localization in
eukaryotic cells with high spatiotemporal resolution.14

Solubility in aqueous media and shielding of the
luminophores from
diffusional quenching are two key aspects to be tackled. In this sense,
dendrimers (dendrons) constitute appealing tools. They are highly
branched, three-dimensional macromolecules, where the size, structure,
and surface functionality are controllable. A few dendritic structures
have been able to encapsulate and to isolate the emitting core Pt(II)
complexes, thus decreasing intermolecular interaction in organic solvents.15−17

We reasoned that the use of alkyl chain-based dendritic structures
to protect the emitting core of a Pt(II) complex should not affect
its photophysical properties, due to the nonconjugated nature of the
encapsulating array, while the functional groups at the periphery
would control the solubility. In this work, we present a concept combining
the unique excited-state characteristics of Pt(II) complexes with
the features of water-soluble dendrimers. We demonstrate that an amino-terminated
amide–alkyl dendritic structure can effectively avoid aggregation
while protecting the emitting core from quenching by molecular oxygen.
Additionally, as a proof of concept, we demonstrate the ability of
such a luminophore to act as a biosensor, labeling the cells with
a green phosphorescence that can be used for two-photon excitation
microscopy.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis and Characterization
In
the design of the
amino-terminal amide–alkyl dendritic-Pt, we chose a BAPAD type
structure as a template,18 and a 3,4-disubstituted
pyridine as an anchoring point for the Pt(II) complex.11 For the synthesis of the dendritic structure
(DG2, Scheme 1, Supporting Information (SI)),
a Boc-protected generation 2 dendron with an alkyne moiety in the
focal point (1, Scheme 1, SI) was prepared and coupled
with 3,5-bis(azidomethyl)pyridine via a copper-catalyzed azide–alkyne
“click” cycloaddition (CuAAC).19 Complex 2 (Scheme 1) was synthesized as previously described.11 The Pt-containing dendritic structure was obtained
by a convenient exchange reaction of the chlorido ligand. After deprotection
of the terminal amino groups, Pt-DG2 was obtained with
a 13% yield. The resulting complex is soluble in aqueous media, due
to the eight amino groups of the structure. These amino groups not
only ensure solubility in aqueous media, but also modulate the biological
activity of the molecule (such as promoting the adhesion to bacteria)
and can be conjugated to a variety of structures with relevant biological
properties.20

Scheme 1 Synthesis of the
Pt-DG2 Complex
Synthesis of the dendritic Pt(II)
complex: (i) copper(II) sulfate and l(+)-ascorbic acid sodium
salt in tert-butanol/water (1:2); (ii) THF, 80 °C,
overnight; (iii) trifluoroacetic acid, THF, overnight.

Characterization by NMR spectroscopy (in D2O) confirmed
the presence of the dendritic complex (see the SI); broad signals between 0 and 4 ppm are characteristic
of the dendritic moiety together with two singlets at 4.44 and 5.69
ppm, corresponding to the methylene groups adjacent to the triazole
ring. The presence of the Pt core is confirmed by the signal between
7.5 and 9 ppm. However, no mass spectrum was obtained, probably due
to the lability of the Pt–N bond of the ancillary ligand.

Diffusion-ordered spectroscopy (DOSY) experiments were carried
out observing a monoexponential decay of the signal (at a concentration
of 10–3 M, Figure 1). This results in a linear Stejskal–Tanner
plot, showing that diffusion of a monodisperse molecule is monitored,
which excludes any aggregation (Figure 1).21,22

of the NMR tube under visible light (left) and excitation at 365 nm
(right); (b) Stejskal–Tanner plot.

Photophysical Characterization
The steady-state and
time-resolved luminescence spectroscopy studies of Pt-DG2 in water showed an absorption band at around 250 nm, which can be
assigned to π–π* excitations, as well as a broad
band around 350 nm that can be ascribed to a transition with mixed
MLCT/LC character (Figure S45, SI).11 In agreement with the results observed in the
DOSY experiments, no significant evidence for ground state aggregation
is observed.

The green luminescence exhibited by the complex
(Figure 2, Table 1) is partially quenched
by molecular oxygen. In fact, both the photoluminescence quantum yields
and the amplitude-weighted average lifetimes are enhanced by a factor
of roughly 3 in deoxygenated samples (Table 1). The biexponential decay can be attributed
to the ensemble of conformations that lead to different decay rates
in the dendritic environment, despite being originated from the same
excited state. Complex environments can lead to such an observation,
as discussed in the literature.23 Even
though aggregation phenomenon could also account for this observation,
the profile of the emission band corresponds to a monomeric species
in a broad concentration range.

(dashed line).

a ϕL quantum yield
and lifetime (λem = 500 nm) of aqueous solutions
of Pt-DG2, 10–5 M (fractional amplitudes

Although the formation of a
small amount of aggregates cannot be
completely ruled out when increasing the concentration (up to 10–4 M), no significant contribution of aggregates is
observed at around 650 nm (Figures 2 and S46).

Pt-DG2 is luminescent in aqueous environments without
the need for complex carriers, such as proteins, micelles, or polymers
(Figure S47, SI). When comparing these
results with similar Pt(II) complexes possessing the same ĈN̂N
luminophore (derived from 2, Scheme 1), a clear influence of the dendritic moiety
can be observed,11 as both the quantum
yield and the lifetime appear enhanced in fluid environments but without
traces of excimeric emission. When the ancillary ligand is a 4-substituted
pyridine, a broad red-shifted emission band (around 600 nm) appears
at higher concentrations, which can be associated with stacked species.
The wavelength of such emission (normally from 3MMLCT states)
depends on the bulkiness of the ancillary ligand and its tilt angle
with respect to the coordination plane.11 Similar Pt(II) complexes have also been modified using a 4-substituted
pyridine with tetraethylene glycol chains as the ancillary ligand.
In that case, solubility in aqueous solution was partially achieved,
observing ground state aggregation at concentrations above 10–4 M. Above this concentration, emission of the aggregates
was observed at 580 nm as well, and luminescence of the monomeric
species was observed at any concentration at room temperature.24

The bulky dendritic ligand DG2 prevents intermolecular
interactions even in aqueous media. Only absorption and emission due
to the monomeric species are observed in aerated aqueous solutions
of Pt-DG2, showing higher luminescence quantum yields
than similar complexes.11,24 The long lifetimes
observed for Pt-DG2 indicate that the dendritic structure
protects the platinum core against the environment, partially avoiding
quenching of the luminescence by molecular oxygen. This is a key feature
for imaging, as it suppresses at least partially the formation of
cytotoxic reactive oxygen species while retaining the phosphorescence
in oxygenated samples. The residual sensitivity to molecular dioxygen
could be used to highlight hypoperfused or anoxic samples and tissues,
as a prolongation of the excited-state lifetime could be monitored.

Excitation and emission spectra acquired by two-photon excitation
(TPE) conditions were also recorded on a confocal optical microscope
equipped with a high-performance laser and a spectrograph (Figure S52, SI). Taking into account the difference
in resolution, the emission observed at 405 nm coincides with the
one measured on the photoluminescence spectrometer in the one-photon
excitation regime. When TPE spectra were recorded for related Pt(II)
complexes where the ancillary ligand is P(Ph)3, no appreciable
emission was observed in THF solution at 10–5 M
(Figure S51, SI). In this particular case,
even concentrations up to 10–4 M only provided an
extremely weak signal, where the contribution of the aggregates is
detectable. In all cases, the two-photonic nature of the observed
phenomenon was confirmed by the quadratic dependence of the emission
intensity on the laser power (Figures S51 and S52, SI).

Pt-DG2 presents therefore the
possibility of combining
one- and two-photon excitation (OPE or TPE, respectively), opening
the way for integrating multiple excitation channels to observe its
luminescence. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first example
of a Pt(II) complex with this potential in aqueous media.

Labeling of E. coli (Gram-Negative)
and P. subtilis (Gram-Positive) Bacteria
with Pt-DG2
To evaluate the use of Pt-DG2 as
a multichannel luminescent marker for biological samples, two E. coli and P. subtilis bacterial strains were employed as a model targets. The amino-terminal
groups of Pt-DG2 provide an effective binder to the Gram-negative
and Gram-positive bacterial surface, owing to their capacity for hydrogen
bonds and electrostatic interaction.20 After
incubation (2 h) with a 10–4 M solution of the complex, Pt-DG2 effectively labeled both E. coli and P. subtilis bacteria, as can
be seen in the optical micrographs (Figures 3, S54, and S55 in the SI).

Figure 3 (a) Excitation (dotted line) and emission (solid line)
spectra
of E. coli incubated for 2 h with Pt-DG2 upon one-photon (black) or two-photon (red) excitation
(405 and 720 nm, respectively), in aqueous solutions. Confocal micrographs
of E. coli incubated for 2 h with (right
row; b2, c2, and d2) or without (left
row; b1, c1, and d1) Pt-DG2: (b1, b2) recorded emission with one-photon
excitation (λexc = 405 nm; collected through 500–600
nm); (c1, c2) bright-field images; (d1, d2) recorded emission with two-photon excitation (λexc = 720 nm; collected through 500–550 nm). Scale bars:
5 μm.

An intense green luminescence
can be observed from the outer surface
of the bacteria, confirming the adhesion of the complex to the bacterial
wall. This characteristic emission can be observed under both OPE
and TPE conditions. This is a key point when performing imaging experiments
of biological samples, which is relevant to distinguish the intrinsic
emission of the luminescent probe from sample autofluorescence and
background noise.25 In untreated bacteria,
an extremely weak autofluorescence is observed under OPE. However,
no autofluorescence is observed under TPE conditions (capture settings
and image processing are identical). Moreover, the emission and excitation
spectra of the stained bacteria resemble those of Pt-DG2 in both OPE and TPE conditions (Figures 2, 3a and S52, SI). The longer excited-state lifetime observed
for stained bacteria (10 μs) also indicates the presence of
the monomeric species and the protection of the Pt(II) core from quenching
processes.

The dynamics of bacterial growth was monitored in
liquid LB medium
originally inoculated with 4 × 106E. coli and P. subtilis and incubated in the presence (10 or 100 μM) or absence of Pt-DG2. No significant E. coli growth delay was recorded with increasing Pt-DG2 concentration
from 10 to 100 μM, but P. subtilis growth was significantly reduced at 100 μM Pt-DG2. (Figure S56 in the SI).

Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) images were also acquired,
where energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms the presence
of platinum (Figures 4 and S57 SI). Although no measurable interaction
between the metal centers is observed in solution, TEM images of incubated
cells show high contrast clusters that are not observed in untreated
bacteria (red arrow in Figure 4b,c). Such Pt clusters provide a possibility of tracking heavy
atoms by means of electron microscopy.

c) E. coli incubated (2 h) with Pt-DG2 (red arrows highlight some of the Pt clusters observed).

Conclusions
By combining the characteristics of dendritic
structures with the
photophysical properties of Pt(II) complexes, we obtained a unique
luminescent marker soluble in aqueous media. The dendritic moiety,
with well-defined structure and three-dimensional geometry, possesses
the ability to encapsulate the emitting core and create a specific
site-shielded nanoenvironment. In this way, the complex constitutes
a triplet emitter whose photophysical properties are perfectly stable
in biological media without the need for a carrier. The approach to
exploiting the luminescence properties of Pt(II) complexes in bioimaging
has been demonstrated using both OPE and TPE conditions. Additionally,
the array has proven to be traceable by electron microscopy and acts
as a probe providing dual orthogonal readouts.

The solvent was removed under vacuum, and the residue was dissolved
in ethyl acetate (30 mL) and washed with water (3 × 30 mL). The
organic phase was dried over MgSO4, and the solvent was
removed. The obtained compound was dissolved in dry THF (5 mL) and
the solution was cooled in an ice-water bath. TFA (2 mL) was added

DOSY Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
(NMR) Experiment for Pt-DG2
The sample was prepared in deuterium
oxide at a concentration of
1 mM. The experiments have been performed on a Bruker Ascend 400 MHz
spectrometer, equipped with a 5 mm BBFOPLUS probe with a 2H “lock”
channel and z gradient. The spectrometer is also
equipped with a control temperature unit prepared to work at temperatures
ranging from 0 to +50 °C. Gradient strength was calibrated by
measuring the diffusion rate of pure water of residual protons in
D2O. Experiments were conducted at 300 K. The samples were
equilibrated for no fewer than 15 min. To determine the diffusion
rates, a two-dimensional sequence using double stimulated echo for
convection compensation and a LED using bipolar gradient pulses for
diffusion were used. A diffusion constant of 2.1 × 10–10 m2/s was observed.

Two-Photon Excitation Experiments
Excitation and emission
scans were performed using a Leica SP5 MP confocal microscope equipped
with a Spectraphysics MaiTai HP pulse IR laser for multiphoton excitation
and an HCX PL APO lambda blue 63× NA 1.40 oil immersion objective
lens. For excitation scans, fluorescence was measured between 500
and 600 nm using an internal PMT detector with excitation varying
from 700 to 1040 nm at 10 nm intervals. For emission scans, samples
were excited at 720 nm and emissions were measured using internal
spectral PMT detectors as a 30 nm window moving from 400 to 700 nm
in 15 nm intervals (20 measurements). TPA cross-sections were determined
by the TPEF method.26 It is assumed that
the quantum efficiencies after two-photon excitation are the same
as those after one-photon excitation. The TPA cross-sections (δ)
were obtained by calibration against rhodamine B with a known δ
value in MeOH solution. Then, the TPA cross-section δ values
were calculated on the basis of the following expression: , where δ is the TPA cross-section, C and η are the concentration and refractive index
of the sample solution, and F is the integrated area
under the TPEF spectrum. Pt-DG2 shows TPA cross-sections
δ of about 3.90 GM [1 GM (Goeppert–Mayer unit) = 10–50 cm4 s molecule–1 photon–1] (710 nm).

Luminescence Microscopy Experiments with E. coli (Gram-Negative) and P. subtilis (Gram-Positive)
Bacteria Incubated with Pt-DG2
Both bacteria (E. coli and P. subtilis) were grown in 10 mL of LB Broth at 37 °C in a rocking incubator
(18 h). Then, culture contents were split into four 15 mL vials, centrifuged
(5000g, 5 min), and washed again in 5 mL of PBS.
After an additional centrifugation (5000g, 5 min),
bacterial pellets were either resuspended in 3 mL of PBS with Pt-DG2 (10–4 M dilution) or resuspended
in 3 mL of PBS alone, followed by a 2 h incubation step in a rocking
incubator (37 °C). Then, both samples were centrifuged (5000g, 5 min) and washed twice in 3 mL of PBS. Finally, each
bacterial sample was resuspended in 100 μL of PBS. Bacterial
cultures were analyzed using a Leica SP5 MP confocal microscope equipped
with Spectraphysics MaiTai HP pulse IR laser for multiphoton excitation
and an HCX PL APO lambda blue 63× NA 1.40 oil immersion objective
lens was used. Bright-field and confocal images were acquired using
405 nm excitation with emissions detected with a spectral PMT detector
set to 500–600 nm. Multiphoton images were acquired sequentially
with excitation at 720 nm and detection between 500 and 550 nm with
an external HyD nondescanned detector.

Bactericidal Test
To examine the bactericidal effect
of Pt-DG2 on Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria,
approximately 4 × 106 colony-forming units of E. coli and P. subtilis were cultured on LB agar plates supplemented with 10 or 100 μM Pt-DG2. Pt-DG2-free LB plates cultured under
the same conditions were used as controls. The plates were incubated
for 24 h at 37 °C, and the number of colonies was recorded. Counts
on the three plates corresponding to a particular sample were averaged.
To examine the bacterial growth rate as well as to determine the growth
curve in the presence of Pt-DG2, E. coli and P. subtilis were grown in liquid
LB medium supplemented with 10 or 100 μM. Growth rates and bacterial
concentrations were determined by measuring the optical density (OD)
at 600 nm every 1 h (OD of 0.1 corresponds to a concentration of 108 cells per cm3) in a FLUOstar Omega de BMG Labtech
device.

Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) Experiments
TEM and EDX measurements of bacteria were performed using a Thermo
Fisher Tecnai G2 20 Twin microscope. For TEM measurements, a drop
of a solution of bacteria in PBS was placed in a copper grid covered
with a Formvar-Carbon film and was left to dry overnight. No contrast
agent was used for these samples. The voltage used was 120 kV, and
the beam of electrons was between 6.94 and 8.80 μA. The exposure
time for image capture was 1 s. To obtain EDX data, a magnification
between 200 and 240 kX was used, focusing the beam on the center of
the bacteria. The spectral measurement was carried out in such a way
that the death time (waiting time for the acquisition between counts)
was around 10–15%, with a total counting duration of 50 s.
