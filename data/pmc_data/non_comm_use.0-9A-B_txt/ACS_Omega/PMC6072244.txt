Currently, in clinics, breast cancer
is treated with free chemotherapeutic
drugs, as a result there is not much therapeutic effect in treated
models, leading to substantial systemic toxicity. To overcome these
critical problems for the primary outcome, we developed the formulated
nanomaterial (FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs) aimed to specifically target cancer
cells via nanoscopic-based drug delivery for getting better therapeutic
effectiveness. In the present study, an isoquinoline alkaloid, berberine
(BBR), was chosen as a cancer therapeutic agent, encapsulated on citrate-capped
silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) through electrostatic interactions (BBR-AgNPs).
Then, BBR-AgNPs were conjugated with polyethylene glycol-functionalized
folic acid (FA-PEG) via hydrogen bonding interactions (FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs).
The transmission electron microscopy study shows the cellular invasion
of the formulated FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs, indicating the accretion of the
nanomaterial at the tumor-specific site. Hence, FA conjugated with
the nanomaterial suggests an efficient release of BBR molecules into
the specific cancer site. Consequently, the results showed an increase
in apoptotic induction via reactive oxygen species and condensed nuclei
in cancer cells. Moreover, the western blotting analysis shows reduced/increased
expression of PI3K, AKT, Ras, Raf, ERK, VEGF, HIF1α, Bcl-2,
Bax, cytochrome c, caspase-9, and caspase-3, thereby
enhancing apoptosis. Likewise, the in vivo antitumor efficiency of
FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs showed a significant restraint of tumor progression,
and histopathological observations of lung, liver, kidney, heart,
and brain tissues proved lesser toxicity of FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs. Thus,
the successfully formulated nanomaterial can serve as a potential
drug-discharging vehicle to combat cancer cells by a molecular-based
targeting approach.

Introduction
Breast cancer is the
most frequently diagnosed cancer among females
worldwide and the second foremost cause of cancer death.1 In 2017, the total estimate was stated as 252 710
cases of invasive breast cancer and 40 610 deaths in the United
States.2,3 Typically, the fast expansion, metastasis,
and angiogenesis of breast tumors owing to the imbalance in the supply
of cellular O2 signify hypoxia.4−6 The PI3K/AKT
and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK molecular signaling network commonly play a central
role in the alteration of several human cancers because these pathways
are involved in cellular physiological functions such as proliferation,
survival, differentiation and metabolism, and cell mobility. Activation
of these signaling pathways is accountable for unrestrained cell proliferation
and activation of these drug resistance ability.7,8 In
addition, the PI3K/AKT and Ras/Raf/ERK signaling network is a primary
regulator of hypoxia by activating the HIF-1α protein. The cancer
cells with the hypoxic condition generate excessive levels of superoxides,
peroxides, hydroxyl radicals, and singlet oxygens, collectively represented
as reactive oxygen species (ROS) that promote angiogenesis, aggressive
phenotypes, drug resistance, and metastasis in cancer cells.9,10 Nowadays, the field of nanotechnology is generating new tools and
techniques in biomedical fields for getting better treatment strategies
to control or cure the disease at molecular levels. In this regard,
the effective delivery of drug molecules combined with nanoparticles
(NPs) improves the treatment strategies of cancer. Besides, the naturally
occurring berberine (BBR) as an isoquinoline alkaloid causes cell
cycle arrest, cell growth inhibition, and cellular apoptosis, suppresses
cell migration and invasion in cancer cells through the intrinsic
pathway,11−14 as well as inhibits the phosphorylation of PI3K/AKT and Raf/MEK/ERK
signaling pathways, consequently reducing the expression of hypoxia-induced
proteins.15 Free administration of BBR
specifically in in vivo conditions causes low aqueous solubility,
little gastrointestinal uptake, and rapid metabolism.16,17 In this context to overcome these obstacles, NP formulations have
been used to improve bioavailability and reduce water solubility efficiently.
Of late, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are the most relevant NPs owing
to their influence on significant genotoxic effects and programmed
cell death (apoptosis) in cancer cells. Recently, Jeong et al. have
reported that obstructing AgNPs induced ROS-mediated apoptotic pathways
in cancerous cells.18 Mostly, the therapeutic
efficacy of a nanodrug system depends upon its targeting ability and
stimulation of responsive cargo release into tissues/cells. Moreover,
a tumor-targeted molecule, folic acid (FA), authorizes the cancer
cell endocytosis and NP accumulation by recognizing its counterpart,
which is over-expressed on many cancer cell surfaces.19 Thus, labeling of folic acid functionalized with polyethylene
glycol (PEG) on NPs could be a healthier method for specifically targeting
cancer cells as well as providing high solubility, prolonged circulation
time, and superior biocompatibility to the formulated nanomaterial.20

In the present study, citrate-capped AgNPs
are fabricated and loaded
with BBR through electrostatic interactions and conjugated with FA-PEG
by hydrogen bonding interactions, denoted as the FA-PEG@BBR-AgNP drug
delivery system that is used as a therapeutic agent for breast carcinoma.
Our research mainly focuses on developing a new nanomaterial, which
acts by using the combined effect of AgNPs and BBR via the folate
receptor. Moreover, the effectively invasive FA-PEG@BBR-AgNP nanomaterial
could be more promising in eliciting molecular-based novel therapeutic
effect by targeting PI3K/AKT and Ras/Raf/ERK signaling pathways, thus
reducing the hypoxia condition in breast cancer cells. Therefore,
the formulated nanomaterials comprise BBR with AgNPs to target PI3K/AKT
and Ras/Raf/ERK signaling pathways and induce severe ROS generations
as well as the use of the PEG-altered drug delivery system demonstrates
a very significant effect on breast cancer cells. Additionally, in
vitro and in vivo studies were performed to investigate the antitumor
effectiveness of the FA-PEG@BBR-AgNP nanomaterial.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
and Characterization of FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs
AgNPs acts as an
efficient drug delivery agent as well as exhibits
intrinsic anticancer activity.25 The chemical
method was followed by the synthesis of citrate-capped AgNPs; the
trisodium citrate serves as a reducing agent for reducing silver salts.
The negatively charged citrate anions assembled into the surface of
the AgNPs. The BBR was positively charged cations, which readily bind
with citrate anion-surfaced AgNPs through electrostatic interactions.
Then, PEG-amine was chosen as the linker between FA and BBR-AgNPs
using hydrogen bond interactions. The reaction mechanism for the synthesis
of FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs is outlined in Scheme 1.

UV–Vis Spectroscopy Studies
UV–visible
absorption spectra of silver nitrate (AgNO3), AgNPs, BBR-AgNPs,
FA-PEG, and FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs are presented in Figure 1. UV–vis spectra are usually the predictable
method for studying the formation of NPs in aqueous suspension.26Figure 1a shows the UV–vis spectra of AgNO3 and
synthesized AgNPs, which reveals that new absorption peaks at 428
nm appeared only for AgNPs. Figure 1b shows the UV–vis spectra of BBR and BBR-AgNPs,
FA-PEG, and FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs. The major absorption peaks at 232, 266,
346, and 428 nm represented BBR; similar peaks were observed by Dai
et al.27 The successful loading of BBR
on the surface of AgNPs was evident from the presence of BBR-AgNPs.
After interactions of BBR with AgNPs, the peaks were slightly changed
from 232, 266, 346, and 428 nm to 230, 264, 348, and 428 nm, respectively,
which confirmed the successful loading of BBR on the surface of the
AgNPs via electrostatic interactions. Subsequently, FA-PEG showed
the major absorption peaks at 275 and 365 nm. Afterward, FA-PEG was
conjugated with BBR-AgNPs through hydrogen bonding interactions to
synthesize FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs, which showed absorption peaks at 220,
270, 350 and 430 nm.

Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) Analysis
FT-IR is a suitable technique for determining the interaction of
BBR on the AgNPs, as well as the conjugation of FA-PEG with BBR-AgNPs. Figure 2 shows the FT-IR
spectra of AgNPs, BBR, BBR-AgNPs, FA-PEG, and FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs. The
significant bands of AgNPs at 3341 cm–1 are assigned
to O–H stretching vibrations and the band at 1606 cm–1 corresponds to C=O stretching vibrations. The peaks at 1387,
1314, and 1110 cm–1 represent C–H stretching
vibrations, and our results agree with those of Sharma and Tapadia.28 The BBR exhibited significant bands at 3452
and 3345 cm–1 that represent N–H and O–H
stretching vibrations, respectively. Other bands at 2947 and 2877
cm–1 correspond to C–H stretches (alkanes);
likewise, peaks at 1576, 1140, and 1023 cm–1 correspond
to aromatic C=C vibrations, CH in-plane bending, and C–H
vibrations, respectively, and these major peaks are matched with the
earlier report.29 FT-IR was further extended
to study about BBR-AgNPs, FA-PEG, and conjugated FA-PEG on the BBR-AgNPs
(FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs). The peak at 3384 cm–1, corresponding
to O–H stretching vibrations of BBR-AgNPs, shifted from the
BBR peak at 3452 and 3345 cm–1. The peaks at 1505
and 1125 cm–1 are due to aromatic C=C vibrations,
and the peak at 1140 cm–1 corresponding to C–H
vibrations disappeared, which indicates no CH in-plane bending. The
major characteristic peaks of the FA-PEG at 2962 and 2889 cm–1, due to C–H stretches, correspond to asymmetric and symmetrical
stretches, respectively. Bands at 1708, 1664, 1402, and 1302 cm–1 show C=O, C=C, C–C, and C–O
stretch, respectively.30 The FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs
were also confirmed through FT-IR spectroscopy; the peaks at 3370
cm–1 were due to the stretching vibrations of AgNPs.
The BBR-AgNP bands at 2962 and 2850 cm–1, representing
C–H stretching (alkanes) and 1505 cm–1 (aromatic
C=C vibrations) were shifted to 2976, 2874, and 1507 cm–1. The other bands at 1708 and 1664 cm–1 are FA-PEG shifted to 1737 and 1649 cm–1, which
confirms the successful loading of FA-PEG on the surface of BBR-AgNPs.

X-Ray Diffraction (XRD)
Analysis
The structural nature
(crystal and phase purity) of the prepared AgNPs and FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs
was studied using the XRD patterns. The diffraction peaks at 38.11°,
44.01°, 65.01°, and 77.01° could be indexed to (111),
(200), (220), and (311) planes of the face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal
structure of AgNPs, respectively (Figure 3a), and well-matched with the Standard Joint
Committee on Powder Diffraction data (JCPDS PDF no. 01-087-0717). Figure 3b shows the peaks
at 17.11°, 24.02°, 45.12°, and 55.32°, indicating
the peaks of BBR,31 as well as peaks at
21.04° and 27.11° responsible for the presence of PEG moieties,
and all other diffraction peaks observed at 8.02° and 16.33°
were due to the presence of folic acid.32

Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Dynamic Light Scattering
(DLS), and Zeta Potential
The micrographs of AgNPs and FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs
are shown in Figure 4. Figure 4a shows
that the monodispersed spherical-shaped AgNPs had an approximate size
ranging from 20 to 30 nm. As illustrated in Figure 4b, the FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs shows a slightly
larger size with spherical shape approximately in the range of 50–60
nm. It is evident from Figure 4c,d that hydrodynamic diameters of the prepared NPs measured
by DLS were 53 ± 2 nm (polydispersity index, PDI = 0.566 ±
0.07) for AgNPs and FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs, and it was found to be 113 ±
4 nm (PDI = 0.297 ± 0.05). Furthermore, the electrostatic stabilization
of NPs was estimated by measuring their zeta potential values (Figure 4e,f). The citrate-capped
AgNPs are negatively charged (−15.6 mV), indicating that the
surplus negative charge of AgNPs might be due to the capping with
citrate.33 The final product, FA-PEG@BBR-AgNP
nanomaterial, possesses a positive charge (+33.28 mV).

the stability
of the formulated FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs in 10% mouse serum (mSerum) suspended
in DMEM, reveals a slight change in size after 72 h. Subsequently,
the obtained result exhibits that the formulated nanomaterial was
found to remain stable under the physiological pH for 72 h (3 days).
The positively charged nanomaterial improves the association and cellular
internalization of negatively charged cell membranes.34

BBR Drug Loading Profile
To evaluate
the encapsulation
efficiency of BBR in the core–shell of AgNPs, the positively
charged BBR encapsulated on the negatively charged AgNPs through electrostatic
interactions. Loading efficacy of BBR-AgNPs was investigated by using
a UV–vis spectrophotometer and theoretical DLC. Initially,
free BBR appeared in dark yellow color; after being encapsulated into
AgNPs, the color turned into brownish yellow, indicating the successful
loading of BBR onto AgNPs. The BBR-loaded AgNPs exhibits the absorption
peaks at 230, 264, 348, and 428 nm. The theoretical DLC was set at
10 wt %, and the results showed that the DLC of BBR-AgNPs was 8.79
wt %, and as a result, BBR was effectively loaded onto the citrate-capped
AgNPs.

In Vitro Drug Release Study
The cumulative quantity
of BBR liberated from the FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs was (Figure 5) calculated under different pH conditions,
for instance, 7.4 (corresponds to the circulatory system), 6.5 (pH
of tumor tissue), and 5.5 (corresponds to the mature endosomes of
tumor cells) at 37 °C, respectively. The drug release was found
to be 7.3, 55.7, and 88.7% at pH 7.4, 6.5, and 5.5, respectively.
An increased quantity of drug was released at pH 5.5 and 6.5 when
compared to pH 7.4 (7.3%). The FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs remains stable for
a considerable period of circulation in the blood at pH 7.4 and thereby
eliminates the premature burst release. The stability, to a large
extent, can reduce the side effects of the drug on normal cells because
the release of BBR from FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs occurs by a pH-sensitive
polymer PEG on the surface of the NPs and inhibits the release of
BBR from the BBR-AgNPs at pH 7.4. On the contrary, the hydrolysis
of PEG leads to simultaneous dissociation on the surface of the nanocarrier
at low pH (pH 6.5 and 5.5). Consequently, it influences the discharge
of BBR from PEG. Our obtained results suggested that the pH-responsive
polymer-based BBR is released from FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs in a controlled
and sustainable manner.

conditions 5.5, 6.5, and 7.4.

In Vitro Cytotoxicity Study
The cytotoxic effects of
AgNPs, BBR, BBR-AgNPs, and FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs were evaluated on MDA-MB-231
(breast cancer cell) and HBL-100 (normal breast cell) by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthialzol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay. The treated HBL-100 cells by AgNPs, BBR, BBR-AgNPs,
and FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs at different concentrations of 1–14 μg/mL
at 48 h. In the final concentration (14 μg/mL), inhibition rate
was found to be 53% for AgNPs, 60% for BBR, 24% for BBR-AgNPs, and
18% for FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs. A significant inhibition rate was observed
with BBR and AgNPs when tested with HBL-100 cells (Figure 6a). The remaining BBR-AgNPs
(24%) and FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs (18%)-treated groups exhibit lesser toxic
effect, indicating the biocompatibility of FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs. However,
the treatment of MDA-MB-231 by AgNPs, BBR, BBR-AgNPs, and FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs
at different drug concentrations (0.2–3 μg/mL) for 48
h showed an increased toxicity in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 6b). The IC50 concentration was found to be 1 μg/mL for FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs.
The FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs exhibit significant inhibitory effects on MDA-MB-231
cells. The increased rate of inhibition effects on cell viability
might be due to the targeted drug delivery system adopted via the
folate receptor, which gets over-expressed in certain types of cancer
cells.19 On the other hand, there was a
less toxic effect on normal cells (HBL-100).35

Figure 6 MTT
assay results reveals the in vitro cytotoxicity effect of
AgNPs, BBR, BBR-AgNPs, and FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs against (a) normal breast
cell lines (HBL-100) and (b) breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 after
incubation for 48 h, respectively. Data represent mean ± SD.
*p ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Analysis of Apoptotic Cells
and Nuclear Morphology by Fluorescence
Microscopy
The apoptosis induction was observed in the MDA-MB-231
cell line after treatment with FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs at the IC50 concentration (1 μg/mL) for 48 h incubation. Briefly, the
treated cells were stained with acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EtBr)
and observed using fluorescence microscopy. As can be seen in Figure 7a, untreated MDA-MB-231
cells (control) were stained with a similar green fluorescence image
because the AO stain can only penetrate into the membrane of the normal
cell. When compared with FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs treated cells, orange color
was observed because of their apoptotic condition. As a result, the
cells exhibited nuclear shrinkage and bulging.36,37

DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole)
staining was used to
study the nuclear morphology of the cells, as well as helps to differentiate
the apoptotic nuclei from healthy cells. As can be seen from the images
of Figure 7b, the untreated
cells (control) exhibited a normal round nucleus morphology and discharged
a weak fluorescence, whereas the FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs nanomaterial-treated
cells exhibited a significant nuclei fragmentation with the compression
of apoptotic nuclei.

Intracellular ROS Generation
The
intracellular oxidative
stress induced via ROS generation was used to investigate the toxicological
reports of nanomaterials.38,39 The investigation about
the capability of various materials such as AgNPs, BBR-AgNPs, and
FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs for intracellular ROS generation was analyzed by
green fluorescence stain DCFH-DA. Under the normoxia condition, the
AgNPs increased intracellular ROS generation in MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 8a), compared to hypoxia
pre-exposed DCF-positive cells. According to previous reports, under
the hypoxia condition, AgNP treatment showed that the ROS generation
reduced the percentage of DCF-positive cells.18 Hence, in the present study, we used BBR-AgNPs and the FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs
for ROS generation, which was further enhanced in MDA-MB-231 cells
under the hypoxia condition. From these results (Figure 8b), ROS scavenger DCFH-DA-stained
BBR-AgNPs and FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs treated MDA-MB-231 cells showed increased
ROS generation under normoxia and hypoxia conditions.

significant.

Cellular Internalization
of BBR-AgNPs and FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs by
TEM Analysis
TEM analysis was used to study the intracellular
diffusion of the nanomaterial and the ultrastructural features of
MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells treated with BBR-AgNPs and FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs. Figure 9 shows a significant
cellular uptake through endocytosis and easy detachment of the polymeric
background at intracellular acidic pH. This could elucidate the possible
interaction of the nanomaterial with endolysosome membranes because
of transitory undermining of the cell membranes, resulting in the
easy entry of the nanomaterial into the cytosol.40,41 At this stage, the BBR is released from FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs, after
the accretion of the nanomaterial in MDA-MB-231 cells. The aim of
the study is to assess the MDA-MB-231 cell-targeting capability of
the nanocarrier such as BBR-AgNPs and FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs through FA
receptor-binding efficacy (over-expressed in many types of cancer).42

mitochondria
of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, sections after 4, 12, and 24 h
of incubation with (a) BBR-AgNPs and (b) FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs.

In Figure 9a,b,
the TEM images of BBR-AgNPs and FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs treated MDA-MB-231
cells indicated the effectiveness of cellular internalization through
different time intervals at 4, 12, and 24 h, respectively. This reveals
a significant amount of cellular uptake of FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs through
the folate receptor, compared with BBR-AgNPs. Besides, the TEM images
showed well-accretion of FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs (red arrow) in the cytoplasm
of the nucleus and mitochondria in MDA-MB-231 cells. On the other
hand, the yellow arrows indicate the nuclear membrane fragmentation,
as well as mitochondrial destruction, by the formulated FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs
in treated breast cancer cells. The above results show a significant amount
of formulated nanomaterial accretion specifically high 
at tumor sites. The constructed nanoscopic-based targeted delivery
system possesses necessary features, such as targeting a particular
site, cell-type specificity, improved cellular uptake, and delivery
to an acidic environment.43 The internalization
of nanomaterials have shown to possess significant therapeutic
properties in FA over-expressed breast cancer cells.

Western Blot
Analysis
The molecular-based activation
of apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells treated with FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs
was studied by western blot analysis. The expression levels of tumor
progression proteins (PI3K, AKT, Ras, Raf, and ERK), angiogenesis
protein (VEGF), hypoxia protein (HIF-1α), and mitochondrial-mediated
apoptotic proteins (Bax, cytochrome c, caspase-9
and caspase-3) and antiapoptotic proteins (Bcl-2) were evaluated.
The results show that the formulated FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs treated cells
caused the downregulation of tumor progression proteins such as PI3K,
AKT, Ras, Raf, ERK, VEGF, and HIF-1α proteins (Figure 10a). The apoptotic regulator
proteins were upregulated (Bax, cytochrome c, caspase-9,
and caspase-3), whereas, the antiapoptotic protein (Bcl-2) was downregulated
(Figure 10b). In our
study, the adequately formulated FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs in higher levels
inhibits the expression of PI3K, AKT and Ras, Raf, and ERK, consequently
blocking the binding of the HIF-1α protein with HIF-1β.
On the other hand, the AgNPs stimulate the depolarization of the mitochondrial
membrane potential (MTP) and result in mitochondrial-attributed apoptosis
via ROS production under the hypoxic condition, leading to the activation
of the pro-apoptotic factors such as cytochrome c, caspase-9, and caspase-3 for the apoptosis to take place in breast
cancer cells. The obtained results demonstrated that the downregulation
of PI3K, AKT and Ras, Raf, ERK, VEGF, and HIF-1α triggered the
apoptotic pathways (Figure 10a–d). Thus, the FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs act as a valuable
nanomaterial to activate the molecular-based stimulation of apoptosis
in hypoxia-conditioned breast cancer cells.

protein (HIF-1α), apoptotic proteins (Bax, cytochrome c, caspase-9, and caspase-3), and antiapoptotic protein

In Vivo Antitumor Activity
The in vivo antitumor efficacy
of AgNPs, BBR, BBR-AgNPs, and FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs with a usage dose of
5 mg/kg body weight delivered intravenously into MDA-MB-231 tumor-bearing
athymic nude mice was assessed. Followed by, recording the treatment
strategy of various nanomaterials on tumor volume of mice group was
evaluated after 24 days. The mice were treated with saline as a control
group, and the tumor volume was increased quickly at 1287.27 ±
0.12 mm3, indicating no significant tumor suppression.
Subsequently, AgNPs (601 mm3) and BBR (470 mm3) show a moderate level of tumor growth suppression when compared
to the control group. The BBR-AgNP-treated group had a tumor volume
of 270 mm3, and FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs treated group had a volume
of 101 mm3 (Figure 11a). However,
the obtained results indicate the significant tumor suppression observed
in FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs than others, owing to the fact that FA conjugation
on the nanomaterial improves the cellular internalization as well
as increases the drug discharging into cancer cells. Then, the body
weight loss was evaluated, which showed variations in the animal body
weight, helpful in in vivo toxicity study. Figure 11b demonstrates a gradual increase in the
body weight of mice that are administered with saline. The decrease
in the AgNP- and BBR-administered animal body weight when compared
to other treated groups reveals that AgNPs and BBR can induce unfavorable
effects at the specified dose concentration. However, BBR-AgNPs and
FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs administered mice group did not show any decrease
in the body weight. Therefore, this result indicates that the formulated
FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs nanomaterial was nontoxic. Furthermore, the assessment
of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining for histological studies
in treated mice groups (saline, AgNPs, BBR, BBR-AgNPs, and FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs)
indicates no significant damage to vital organs such as lungs, liver,
kidneys, heart, and brain (Figure 11c). Although, the histological image of AgNPs and BBR-treated
mice group shows acute inflammation, as well as organ injury in liver,
heart, and kidneys, indicating that the free drug molecules can cause
severe side effects in treated mice. Hence, using FA-PEG formulations
with BBR-AgNPs, desired applications including biocompatibility, organ
specificity, biodegradability, and targeted drug delivery can be obtained.
Besides, at pH 7.4 corresponding to blood circulation, at this environment
unfavorable for release of drugs, owing to stimulating the normal
cell killing efficacy, but FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs nanomaterial enhances
the selective delivery of the drugs at tumor-specific sites (pH 5.5)
by FA conjugation. Thus, the formulated nanomaterial minimizes the
side effects of drugs and increases the anticancer activity of breast
cancer cells.

Conclusions
In
summary, the prepared biocompatible FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs based drug
delivery specifically targeted the breast cancer cells. The formulated
nanomaterial stimulates their cellular uptake by breast cancer cells,
which was visualized by Bio-TEM images. The internalized nanomaterial
disassembled their components including BBR & AgNPs into the cytoplasms
of breast cancer cells, which synergistically induce cytotoxicity
via the inhibition of PI3K/AKT and Ras/Raf/ERK protein expression
to block the HIF-1α expression. Besides, the induction of depolarization
in MTP to generate the highest level of ROS generation in mitochondria
subsequently, to release the cytochrome c, and to
activate the apoptotic pathway. Then, we verified the superior biocompatibility
and tumor inhibition of the FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs nanomaterial, and this
reveals the effective inhibition of the tumor progression with no
acute toxicity in vital organs. In this view, the formulated FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs
accomplished by precisely targeting the hypoxia condition via the
downregulation of PI3K/AKT and Ras/Raf/ERK signaling networks, as
a result of discrete therapeutic effectiveness and achieving severe
synergistic cancer therapy with diminished tumor cell masses in mice
models. Conclusively, the present finding shows the functionally upgraded
FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs as a prominent drug carrier, which could perform
as an effective drug delivery for the molecular-based cancer therapy.
Thus, the formulated nanomaterial (FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs) might be a promising
approach for targeted drug delivery in breast carcinoma.

Materials and
Methods
Materials
Silver nitrate (AgNO3), trisodium
citrate (C6H5O7Na3·2H2O), berberine hydrochloride, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), PEG
(MW 4000), folic acid (MW 441.4), N,N′-dicyclohexyl carbodiimide (DCC), and N-hydroxysuccinimide
(NHS) were obtained from HiMedia. MTT, DAPI, and AO/EtBr were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (India).

Synthesis of BBR-AgNPs and Drug Loading Content
In
a typical procedure, the synthesis of AgNPs was followed by the previously
reported method.21 Then, 50 mg of AgNPs
was mixed with 50 mg of BBR in 10 mL of DMSO solution and stirred
overnight. The reaction mixture was transferred to the dialyzer method
at 25 °C for 24 h, respectively. After that, BBR-AgNPs were purified
using a dialysis tube against ultrapure water to easily remove the
unloaded BBR and DMSO solution.

The BBR loading efficacy of
citrate-capped AgNPs was calculated by two methods: first, an indirect
method by estimating the BBR content of the supernatant of the solution
and, second, a direct method is the estimation of the BBR content
present in the pellet obtained after centrifugation at 10 000
rpm for 30 min. The drug concentration in the supernatant and pellets
was measured in UV absorbance at 345 nm by using UV–visible
spectroscopy, and the percentage of loading BBR-AgNPs were estimated
by the following formula.  where wo is the
weight of BBR loaded on the AgNPs and w is the weight
of AgNPs.

Synthesis of Folic Acid-Polyethylene Glycol (FA-PEG)
FA-PEG was prepared by a previously reported method with slight modification.22 Briefly, about 10 mg of FA was reacted with
DCC/NHS at a different ratio 10:5:5 in dimethyl sulfoxide (2.5 mL),
which was stirred and kept in the dark for 5 h at 50 °C. Afterward,
the reaction solution was mixed with 1 mg of PEG-bisamine (MW 4000)
dissolved in a mixture of DMSO (2.5 mL) and then added with 0.1 mL
of triethylamine. The mixture solution was stirred overnight at room
temperature. The obtained product was isolated and purified by the
dialysis method for the removal of unconjugated FA and unreacted PEG-bisamine.

Synthesis of FA-PEG@BBR-AgNP Nanomaterial
For the synthesis
of the FA-PEG@BBR-AgNP nanomaterial, 20 mg of BBR-AgNPs in 10 mL phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS, pH 7.4) was added using 0.5 mL FA-PEG amine and stirred
for 24 h in 27 °C. Later, the final product was centrifuged and
washed several times using Milli-Q water to remove unconjugated FA-PEG
and dried overnight in a vacuum at 45 °C and used for further
study.

Characterization of FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs
The formation
and stability of NPs in aqueous solution was determined using a UV–visible
spectrophotometer (UV-1800, Shimadzu). The assessment of composition
in NPs was carried out on a JASCO (FT-IR-400) spectrophotometer in
the range of 400–4000 cm–1 using the KBr
pellet technique. The nature of the NPs was analyzed by XRD, completely
indexed to the fcc and well-matched with the available Joint Committee
on Powder Diffraction Standards Ag (JCPDS PDF no. 01-087-0717). The
morphology of AgNPs and FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs was investigated using a
TEM (EM TECNAI microscope). The particle surface charge (zeta potential)
was measured by Nanotrac wave, and the average size distribution of
NPs was determined by DLS using Mastersizer 3000. The stability of
the formulated FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs in 10% mouse serum in DMEM or 0.01
M phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 72 h was evaluated
by dynamic light scattering (DLS).

BBR Release Assay
In vitro, the BBR release response
from FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs was carried out in systemic physiological pH
of 7.4, 6.5, and 5.5 at 37 °C, respectively. The BBR discharge
profiles from FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs were measured by dialysis bag methods.
Therefore, the FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs (200 mg) was suspended in 1 mL PBS
solution, permitted to stabilize the solution for 30 min, and positioned
in a dialysis bag. The dialysis bag was submerged in 10 mL of PBS
buffer solution having pH of 7.4, 6.5, and 5.5 and then incubated
in a water bath at 37 °C and stirred at 110 rpm, respectively.
At prearranged time intervals, 1 mL of PBS was collected from the
medium to measure the released BBR quantity and replaced with the
same new PBS solution. The BBR releasing concentration was measured
at 420 nm to find out the level of BBR release from FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs.
All experiments were conducted in triplicate at each pH selected for
the investigation.

Biological Experiment
Cell Line and Culture Conditions
For the cytotoxicity
study of AgNPs, BBR, BBR-AgNPs, and FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs on MDA-MB-231
(breast cancer cell) and HBL-100 (normal breast cell) were purchased
from NCCS (National Centre for Cell Science) Pune, India. These cells
were grown in 90% DMEM (Dulbecco’s modified Eagles medium)
and added with nonessential amino acids (0.1 mM), l-glutamine
(2 mM), and fetal bovine serum (FBS, 10%) at 37 °C and 5% CO2 condition.

In Vitro Cytotoxicity Studies
MTT
assay was used to
evaluate the cytotoxicity of AgNPs, BBR, BBR-AgNPs, and FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs
at different concentrations against HBL-100 normal breast cells and
MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Briefly, the breast cancer cells and
normal breast cells were seeded into a 96-well plate at a density
of 2 × 105 cells/well in 100 μL of complete
Dulbecco’s modified Eagles medium (DMEM) containing 10% FBS
and nonessential amino acids and cultured for 1 day at 37 °C
in a 5% CO2 incubator. Subsequently, the breast cancer
cells (0.2–3 μg/mL) and normal breast cells (1–14
μg/mL) were treated with various concentrations of AgNPs, BBR,
BBR-AgNPs, and FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs for 48 h. After incubation, MTT stock
solution (5 mg/mL in PBS, 20 μL) was added to each well and
incubated for another 4 h. The culture media were completely removed
and added with 150 μL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to each well
to dissolve the formazan blue crystal. The absorbance was recorded
using a microplate reader (Bio-TekELx800) at the wavelength of 572
nm.

Fluorescence Microscopic Studies
AO/EtBr and DAPI Staining
The cells were grown in a
6-well plate (2 × 106 cells/well) and treated with
FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs for 48 h. Then, the treated MDA-MB-231 cells were
stained with 50 μL acridine orange (AO, 1 mg/mL) and ethidium
bromide (EtBr, 1 mg/mL), and on the other hand, the MDA-MB-231 cells
were stained with DAPI (nuclear staining). Later, the stained cells
were washed with PBS and incubated for 20 min.23 These cells were examined under a fluorescence microscope
(Nikon Eclipse, Inc., Japan).

Determination of Intracellular
ROS Levels
The determination
of ROS production in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were treated with
AgNPs, BBR-AgNPs and PEG-FA@BBR-AgNPs (2 μg/mL) using the DCFH-DA
stain was according to the method of Chen et al.24 Briefly, the intracellular ROS production monitored in
the cells (5 × 105 cells/well) was pipetted to a six-well
plate and treated with various compounds (AgNPs, BBR-AgNPs and PEG-FA@BBR-AgNPs)
for 24 h and stained with DCFH-DA (5 μg/mL). The ROS generation
was observed through a fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse, Inc.,
Japan) at 488 and 530 nm, respectively. Finally, the mean fluorescence
intensity of DCF was evaluated by using a fluorescence plate reader.

TEM Analysis for Internalization of BBR-AgNPs and FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs
The cellular internalization of BBR-AgNPs and FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs
by MDA-MB-231 cells was evaluated. Briefly, the MDA-MB-231 cells were
treated with BBR-AgNPs and FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs, and then, the cells were
washed with PBS buffer solution to remove the boundless BBR-AgNPs
and FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs. Then, the cells were fixed in glutaraldehyde
(2.5%) for 30 min at 4 °C and washed with PBS buffer solution.
Following, the different ratios of acetone and Spurr low viscosity
resin was used in 3:1, 1:1, and 1:3 and incubated with beam capsules
at 70 °C for 80 h, respectively. Microtome was used for 60 nm
thickness cell section and then stained with 0.5% uranyl acetate and
observed under a TEM microscope.

Western Blot Analysis
The MDA-MB-231 cells were treated
with FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs (1 μg/mL) and incubated for 24 h and then
washed with ice-cold PBS buffer solution twice. Afterward, the cell
extract was centrifuged for 5 min at 25 000 rpm to dispose
the supernatant immediately. The centrifuged cells were washed with
PBS solution and immersed in the lysis buffer containing (100 μL)
Tris-HCl (50 mM), NaCl (150 mM), Triton X-100 (1%), phenylmethane-sulfonyl
fluoride (1 mM), pepstatin (10 μg/mL), and leupeptin (10 μg/mL)
at pH 8.0. The lysis buffer with cells was centrifuged for 10 min
at 12 000 rpm at 4 °C, and the supernatants were stored
at −80 °C for further use. The following 30 μg/lane
proteins were separated using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (10%) and then transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride
(PVDF) membranes. The PVDF membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered
saline and Tween 20 (TBST) solution containing a nonfat milk (5% (w/v))
for 2 h, at 4 °C in overnight incubation with primary antibodies
such as PI3K, AKT, Ras, Raf, ERK, HIF-1α, VEGF, Bax, Bcl-2,
cytochrome c, caspase-9, caspase-3, and β-actin
as a loading control in blots. The blots were washed with TBST buffer
solution and tagged with secondary antibodies and combined with horseradish
peroxidase for 1 h at ambient temperature.

In Vivo Anticancer Efficacy
As per the Institutional
Animal Ethical Committee (IAEC) of Periyar University (PU/IAEC 1085/PO/OC/07/CPCSEA/ZOOC/04/2016),
the in vivo study has been permitted and approved. Initially, the
female athymic nude mice (5–6 week old) were subcutaneously
injected with MDA-MB-231 cells (5 × 106). After 7
days, the mice were randomly divided into five groups with five mice
in each group. The mice of group A, normal saline; group B, AgNPs;
group C, BBR; group D, BBR-AgNPs; and group E; FA-PEG@BBR-AgNPs and
the concentration of 5 mg/kg body weight were injected intravenously
via tail every 2 days for 24 days. After the experimental period,
the tumor volume of mice was calculated by using the following formula: V = [length × (width)2]/2. After measuring
the tumor volume, the treated mice were sacrificed by using the CO2 inhalation method, and the major vital organs like lung,
liver, kidney, heart, and brain were collected and then immediately
fixed in 10% paraformaldehyde in PBS solution for the histopathological
study. The vital organs were embedded in paraffin and sliced
into 4 μm sections using a microtome and then placed onto the
slide and stained with H&E (hematoxylin and eosin) and observed
using a Nikon light microscope.

Statistical Analysis
The data were calculated as the
mean ± standard deviation (SD) of the experiments performed in
triplicates. Statistical comparisons were carried out using student’s t-test. *p ≤ 0.05 was considered
to be significant.
