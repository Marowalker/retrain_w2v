Layered cobalt hydroxides are cost-efficient
electrocatalysts for
oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the field of energy conversion.
Herein, we developed a facile synthesis method of 3d transition-metal-doped
α-Co(OH)2 nanomaterials mediated with ammonia in
water–methanol at room temperature. The doping of Cu2+ and Ni2+ leads to flower-like nanostructures similar
to pure α-Co(OH)2, whereas the doping of Fe2+ produces nanoparticles with more than 2 times larger surface area
in comparison with the Cu2+- and Ni2+-doped
nanoflowers. The obtained dispersion with the addition of Nafion can
be used directly as an electrocatalyst for OER with excellent catalytic
activity, especially that the overpotential of Fe2+ doped
is as low as 290 mV at 10 mA cm–2 and the turnover
frequency is improved by 3 times as compared with that of α-Co(OH)2. Furthermore, the catalyst can be loaded onto foam nickel,
which presents excellent durability with the current density unchanged
under continuous chronoamperometry reaction for as long as 12 h and
almost quantitative faradaic efficiency. The superior electrocatalytic
properties combined with the simple synthesis without the tedious
purification procedure is very promising for OER.

Introduction
Water splitting into
oxygen and hydrogen is a promising strategy
toward sustainable renewable energy resources.1−4 There are various methods for
water splitting including electrochemical, photocatalytic, photobiological,
and thermal decomposition.5−7 Among them, electrochemical approach
is simple, cost-effective, and clean and provides great potential
for water splitting.8 Electrochemical water
splitting involves water oxidation to oxygen at the anode and proton
reduction to hydrogen at the cathode. Owing to the sluggish kinetics
of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the conversion efficiency of water
to fuel is low.9,10 Thus, development of efficient
catalysts to reduce the kinetic barrier for OER is urgent in the field
of water splitting.11−14

Layered cobalt hydroxides (LCHs) have gained increasing attention
because of their promising electrochemical applications, especially
for supercapacitors and electrochemical water splitting.15−17 LCH can be crystallized in two polymorphs as the hydrotalcite-like
α-Co(OH)2 and the brucite-like β-Co(OH)2. The β-Co(OH)2 is a thermodynamically stable
phase as compared to the metastable α-Co(OH)2, whereas
α-Co(OH)2 is theoretically expected to exhibit higher
electrochemical activity than β-Co(OH)2.18−20 Some research studies illustrated that amorphous Co(OH)2 presents high electrochemical activity as well.21−24

The application of Co(OH)2 in electrochemical water
splitting requires the large surface area or more active sites on
the surface of the catalysis.25,26 Several methods for
the synthesis of ultrathin nanostructural Co(OH)2 have
been developed recently and used as electrocatalysis for OER. Three-dimensional
flower-like α-Co(OH)2 hierarchical microspheres were
fabricated via a solvothermal method with dodecyl benzene sulfate
as a surfactant.27 α-Co(OH)2 and β-Co(OH)2 nanosheets were selectively synthesized
through an epoxide precipitation reaction under mediation of fluoride
ions.28 Unilamellar cobalt hydroxide nanosheets
can be obtained by direct exfoliation of nanocones in formamide.29,30 Ultrathin α-Co(OH)2 nanostructures were prepared
through 2-methylimidazole-mediated methods with good to excellent
electrocatalytic activity.31−33 Transition-metal doping has also
been proved as an efficient method to improve the electrocatalytic
activity of Co(OH)2.34−37 Copper- or iron-doped Co(OH)2 has been
respectively reported to effectively catalyze water oxidation at the
overpotential around 300 mV at 10 mA cm–2 current
density with the former synthesized via NaBH4 reducing
method and the latter precipitated with NaOH in the presence of NaNO3, NH4F, and sodium citrate under N2 atmosphere.38,39 Cobalt iron hydroxides electrodeposited on nickel foam films have
also been proved to exhibit excellent catalytic effect for OER.40

Ammonia as a weak and evaporable alkaline
has been broadly used
to synthesize transition-metal-layered hydroxide materials.41−43 It is different from NaOH or KOH to only afford [OH]− and ammonia can also act as a ligand to resolve Co(OH)2 through forming Co(NH3)62+.44−46 Xu and Zeng systematically examined the interconversion of α-Co(OH)2 and β-Co(OH)2 mediated with liquid ammonia.
They concluded that the addition time of Co2+, aging time,
and preparative atmosphere play key roles in controlling the phase
of Co(OH)2.47 Rajamathi et al.
successfully synthesized α-Co(OH)2 mediated with
ammonia solution containing an excess of sodium salt.48 Although α-Co(OH)2 can be synthesized
easily via ammonia-mediated method, to the best of our best knowledge,
there is still no report about their electrocatalytic application
probably because of their limited active sites on the surface. In
this manuscript, we present a facile method for the synthesis of α-Co(OH)2 and 3d transition-metal-doped α-Co(OH)2 nanomaterials.
The synthesis was carried out by simply reacting ammonia with cobalt
salt with or without the addition of the 3d transition-metal chloride
using water–methanol as a solvent at room temperature. The
obtained α-Co(OH)2 nanoflowers can be directly used
as a catalyst, which shows moderate electrocatalytic activity for
OER. Interestingly, the electrocatalytic activity can be improved
via incorporating the 3d transition metal into α-Co(OH)2, especially that the Fe doped α-Co(OH)2 has
an overpotential as low as 290 mV at 10 mA cm–2 current
density. The resulted doped α-Co(OH)2 can be loaded
onto nickel foam as an electrode, which demonstrated long durability.

Results
and Discussion
Aggregated α-Co(OH)2 was
produced via precipitating
Co(NO3)2 with ammonia using water as a solvent
(Figure S1). However, by replacing water
with water–methanol solution, homogeneous green dispersion
can be obtained within 30 min, which presented the typical UV–vis
absorption peaks of α-Co(OH)2 at 586 and 642 nm (the
inset of Figure 1a).31 The characteristic X-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks
of α-Co(OH)2 at 9.6°, 19.3°, 33.4°,
and 59.6° correspond to the lattice distances of (003), (006),
(012), and (110) planes of α-Co(OH)2 (JCPDS no. 46-0605)
(Figure 1a).49,50 As shown in the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) images in Figure 1b,c, the products have the flower-like nanostructure
with two-dimensional petals. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images
show the clear lattice fringes of 0.26 nm, which belong to the (012)
planes of α-Co(OH)2 (Figure 1d). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area of the product is 42 m2/g, which exhibits
the type IV adsorption (Figure S2a). The
solvent-induced effects have been demonstrated to play an important
role in nanostructure growth processes. Especially, the dual-solvent
system of alcohol and water can lead to the formation of ultrathin
α-Co(OH)2 using 2-methylimidazole as the alkali source
and the surface modifier.51,52 The advantage of the
present synthesis method is that it does not need expensive organic
ligands and complicated purification process.

absorption and optical image of α-Co(OH)2); (b) SEM
image of α-Co(OH)2; (c) TEM image of α-Co(OH)2; and (d) HRTEM image of α-Co(OH)2.

In the next step, 3d transition metals were incorporated
into α-Co(OH)2 via adding various amounts of FeCl2, CuCl2, or NiCl2 to the precursor solution.
As shown
in the XRD patterns in Figure 2, the diffraction peaks of α-Co(OH)2 were
kept unchanged with three extra peaks at 16°, 31°, and 39°
appeared for Cu2+- and Ni2+-doped samples, which
can be assigned to Cu(OH)2 and Ni(OH)2, respectively.
In contrast, the XRD pattern of Fe-doped sample exhibits an obvious
broadening of the diffraction peaks and shifts to higher angles (∼0.4°)
relative to α-Co(OH)2, which probably indicates the
partial substitution of Co2+ by Fe2+ to form
CoxFe(1–x)(OH)2.24 The morphologies
of the synthesized 3d transition-metal-doped α-Co(OH)2 were investigated with SEM and TEM (Figure 3). Copper and nickel doping results in the
flower-like nanostructures similar to pure α-Co(OH)2 (Figure 3a–f).
Unexpectedly, iron doping leads to particle-like morphology. Elemental
mappings of the doped α-Co(OH)2 indicate the uniform
distribution of 3d transition metal in the products. The BET surface
area of the products was 35, 40, and 110 m2/g for Cu-Co(OH)2, Ni-Co(OH)2, and Fe-Co(OH)2, respectively
(Figure S2b–d). Especially, Fe-Co(OH)2 has an obvious mesoporous hole with a width of 3–4
nm. This illustrates that the doping of Cu2+ and Ni2+ does not change the morphology of Co(OH)2 significantly.
In contrast, the Fe doping leads to nanoparticles with more than 2
times larger surface area in comparison with the nanoflowers.

and (i) EDX mapping.

The produced Co(OH)2 dispersion with the addition of
Nafion was loaded directly onto the glassy carbon working electrode
for the electrochemical measurement at 1 M KOH alkaline solution.
To obtain reliable data, multiple cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests were
performed before the liner sweep voltammetry (LSV) experiment was
carried out. Figure 4a shows the LSV curves of all the electrodes with the scan rate of
10 mV s–1. α-Co(OH)2 obtained in
water–methanol solution exhibits moderate OER performance with
the onset potential of 1.40 V and the overpotential of 340 mV at 10
mA cm–2. In comparison, α-Co(OH)2 obtained in pure water displays much poor OER performance. The doping
of Ni2+ does not improve the performance. In contrast,
the incorporation of Cu2+ or Fe2+ reduces the
overpotential significantly (Figure 4a). After carefully optimizing the ratio of 3d transition
metal to Co2+, the samples containing 30% Cu2+ or 20% Fe2+ in mole gave rise to the lowest overpotential
of 295 and 290 mV at 10 mA cm–2, respectively (Figure S3). For comparison, LSV experiments of
the 3d metal doping Co(OH)2 synthesized at pure water were
undertook to give rise to the negative results similar to Co(OH)2@H2O (Figure S3). This
indicates that the using solvent has an important effect on the reactivity
for the same element content catalysis, which the pure water leads
to the aggregated morphology (Figure S1).

at 1.64 V vs RHE in 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz with an ac amplitude of 5 mV,
the inset is the equivalent circuit model; and (e) current density
vs scan rate plot for estimation of ECSA.

Encouraged by these results, we then investigated the stability
of α-Co(OH)2, Cu-Co(OH)2, and Fe-Co(OH)2 via performing the continuous CV between 0.0 and 0.6 V (vs
Ag/AgCl) at a scan rate of 100 mV s–1. The LSV curve
of Fe-Cu(OH)2 has no obvious change even after 1000 continuous
cycles, whereas the curves of α-Co(OH)2 and Cu-Co(OH)2 change slightly (Figure 4b). These indicate that Fe-Co(OH)2 not only
has the lowest overpotential but also is of excellently stability.
Additionally, the turnover frequencies (TOFs) were measured. The TOF
values of α-Co(OH)2, Cu-Co(OH)2, and Fe-Co(OH)2 are 1.24 × 10–3, 3.24 × 10–3, and 4.00 × 10–3 s–1, respectively. The value of Fe-Co(OH)2 is the highest
and 3 times higher than that of α-Co(OH)2.

To better understand the OER process, the electrocatalytic kinetics
of the OER process were evaluated using Tafel plots (Figure 4c). Fe-Co(OH)2 has
the lowest Tafel slope of 69 mV dec–1 compared to
81 and 95 mV dec–1 for α-Co(OH)2 and Cu-Co(OH)2, indicating its quicker electrocatalytic
kinetics and higher OER electrochemical catalytic activity. The large
Tafel slope of Cu-Co(OH)2 is probably due to the raised
LSV curve before 1.5 V caused by the copper oxidation peak. Furthermore,
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted to evaluate
the electron transport ability and further study the OER kinetics.
Equivalent circuit model is shown in the inset in Figure 4d. The solution resistance
(Rs) values of the samples are the same
as 12 Ω. The electron-transfer resistance (Rct) values of α-Co(OH)2, Cu-Co(OH)2, and Fe-Co(OH)2 is 29, 17, and 15 Ω, respectively
(Figure 4d). The smaller Rct values of Fe-Co(OH)2 and Cu-Co(OH)2 indicate their more efficient charge transport during the
electrochemical OER process than α-Co(OH)2. Furthermore,
the electrochemically active surface areas (ECSAs) were estimated
from the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) in the non-faradaic region in the scan rate range
of 1–20 mV s–1 (Figure S4). The Cdl are 41.17, 60.75,
and 109.11 mF cm–2 for α-Co(OH)2, Cu-Co(OH)2, and Fe-Co(OH)2, respectively
(Figure 4e). The improved
catalytic activity of Cu-Co(OH)2 and Fe-Co(OH)2 can be attributed to the lower charge-transfer resistance and the
larger electrochemical surface area than Co(OH)2 because
of Cu or Fe doping.

Consequently, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) measurements
were carried out to examine the electronic structure of α-Co(OH)2, Cu-Co(OH)2, and Fe-Co(OH)2. The obtained
spectra show distinctive peaks of Co, Cu, Fe, and O (Figure S5), indicating the successful doping of Cu2+ and Fe2+ in α-Co(OH)2. The high-resolution
Co 2p spectra of α-Co(OH)2, Cu-Co(OH)2, and Fe-Co(OH)2 are shown in Figure 5a. There is a slight shift of 0.24 and 0.41
eV for Co 2p3/2 and 0.15 and 0.2 eV for Co 2p1/2 in Cu-Co(OH)2 and Fe-Co(OH)2 toward lower
binding energy as compared with that of α-Co(OH)2. The shift of the binding energy in Cu- and Fe-doped α-Co(OH)2 reveals the strong coupling between Cu, Fe, and Co for the
doped α-Co(OH)2.53,54 In addition,
we can observe that the content of Co2+ increases and the
content of Co3+ decreases after doping. This means that
doping facilitates the formation of hydroperoxy (OOH) species,23,55,56 which was regarded as the active
phase for many Co-based OER catalysts.53 The O 1s XPS spectra for Cu-Co(OH)2 and Fe-Co(OH)2 also present the obvious shift toward lower binding energy
side (Figure 5b). These
indicate the strong electronic interaction between Cu and Fe with
α-Co(OH)2.57 The high-resolution
Cu XPS curve of Cu-Co(OH)2 can be ascribed as Cu 2p3/2 (935.2 eV) and Cu 2p1/2 (955.1 eV) with two
shake satellite peaks (943.1 and 962.9 eV). For the high-resolution
Fe XPS spectra of Fe-Co(OH)2, two main peaks of Fe 2p3/2 (712.6 eV) and Fe 2p1/2 (725.8 eV) with the
satellite peak at 717.6 eV are observed, demonstrating the presence
of Fe3+.57 Fe3+ is
usually considered as a redox-active species that can cooperate with
Co to participate in the redox-hopping-type charge transfer, resulting
in better OER activity.26

spectra of Co 2p; (b) O 1s for α-Co(OH)2, Cu-Co(OH)2, and Fe-Co(OH)2; (c) high-resolution
Cu XPS spectrum of Cu-Co(OH)2; and (d) high-resolution
Fe XPS spectrum of Fe-Co(OH)2.

As can be seen from the above results, Fe-Co(OH)2 has
the smallest Tafel slope and electron-transfer resistance with the
largest electrochemical double-layer capacitance, which presents the
best catalytic activity among the tested catalysts. To extend its
application in water split, Fe-Co(OH)2 was loaded onto
a nickel foam (1 × 1 cm) and the chronoamperometry (CP) experiment
was performed on the resulted electrode. The current density remains
unchanged at 10 mA cm–2 under continuous CP reaction
for as long as 12 h at the overpotential of 270 mV (Figure 6a), and the LSV curve barely
changes after 12 h test (Figure 6b). This demonstrates the long durability of the electrode.
Furthermore, the volume of the released mixed gas of H2 and O2 was measured with a gas burette. 31.2 mL of gas
was produced within 60 min, and the faradaic efficiency is calculated
as 99% (Figure 6c).15,29

Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrate the facile synthesis of 3d transition-metal-doped
α-Co(OH)2 nanostructures in H2O/MeOH cosolvent
mediated with ammonia at room temperature. The doping of Cu2+ and Ni2+ gives rise to the nanoflower structures similar
to pure α-Co(OH)2; however, the doping of Fe2+ leads to particle morphology with more than 2 times larger
surface area in comparison with the nanoflowers. The obtained dispersion
together with Nafion can be used directly as electrocatalysis for
OER with good to excellent catalytic activity, avoiding time-consuming
purification procedure. The incorporation of Cu2+ and Fe2+ improves the OER performance significantly, especially that
the overpotential of the Fe2+-doped sample is as low as
290 mV at 10 mA cm–2 and the TOF is improved 3 times
as compared with that of α-Co(OH)2. The electrode
of Fe-Co(OH)2/nickel foam presents excellent durability
and almost quantitative faradaic efficiency. The ammonia-mediated
synthesis route proposed in this work is simple and of low cost and
up-scale synthesis can be performed easily. The produced products
are very promising catalysts for electrochemical water splitting.

Experimental
Section
Materials and Characterization
Co(NO3)2·6H2O (99%), CuCl2·2H2O (99%), FeCl2·4H2O (99%), NiCl2·2H2O (99%), and NH3·H2O (25–28%) were purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation.
Nafion perfluorinated resin solution was received from Sigma-Aldrich.
All chemicals were used without further purifications.

Morphology
characterization was performed using a scanning electron microscope
(JSM-6700F) and a transmission electron microscope (JEM-2100F) equipped
with EDX (X-Max 80T, Oxford). Powder XRD patterns were recorded on
a powder diffractometer (SmartLab9, Rigaku). The absorption spectra
were recorded using a TU-1901 UV–visible spectrometer. XPS
was recorded in a RBD-upgraded PHI-5000C ESCA system (PerkinElmer)
with Al Kα radiation (hν = 1486.6 eV).
Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were operated on an
automated surface area pore size analyzer (QUADRASORB evo).

Synthesis
of the α-Co(OH)2 Nanoflowers
Co(NO3)2·6H2O (582 mg, 2 mmol)
was dissolved in 15 mL of methanol/H2O (3/1, v/v). NH3·H2O (300 μL) diluted in 5 mL of methanol/H2O (3/1, v/v) was then added slowly under magnetic stirring.
The reaction continued for 30 min at room temperature to give a homogeneous
green colloid solution. Finally, the green α-Co(OH)2 product was collected via centrifugation and dried under air. The
synthesis of 3d transition-metal-doped Co(OH)2 was similar
to this procedure except with the addition of various amounts of CuCl2·2H2O, FeCl2·4H2O, or NiCl2·2H2O, respectively.

Electrochemical
Measurement
The glassy carbon electrode
(GCE) with a diameter of 3 mm was selected as the working electrode.
For the preparation of catalysis ink, 40 μL of ethanol solution
of Nafion (5 wt %) was added to 1 mL of Co(OH)2 reaction
mixture and sonicated for 30 min. Subsequently, 6 μL of catalyst
ink was dropped on the GCE and then dried overnight at room temperature.
The electrochemical tests were carried out on a standard three-electrode
system with an Autolab Nova III electrochemical workstation. An Ag/AgCl
electrode with 3 M KCl solution and a platinum foil were used as the
reference and counter electrodes, respectively. KOH solution (1.0
M, pH = 13.9) was used as the electrolyte. All potentials measured
were calibrated to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) using the
following equation  

LSV curves were recorded at a scan
rate of 10 mV s–1. The impedance spectra were recorded
under 0.602 V (vs Ag/AgCl) in the frequency range from 105 to 0.1 Hz with a sinusoidal 5 mV amplitude, possibly.

The
TOF values were calculated from equation  where J is the current density
at a fixed overpotential (e.g. η = 300 mV), A is the geometrical surface area of the electrode, F is the Faraday constant (a value of 96 485 C mol–1), and M is the mole of metal on the electrode.
All the metal atoms are assumed to be the catalytically active sites,
which indicates that the minimum values of TOF were calculated.  where F is the Faraday constant, nO2 (mol) is the total amount of the
produced O2, the four electrons are needed to produce one
O2 molecule, and It means under a constant
oxidation current (I) within a certain time (t).
