Catalysts
prepared for ethanol dehydration in a fixed-bed reactor
acted as strong active acidic catalysts under reaction conditions
at lower temperatures. Experimental conditions including the catalyst
type [active aluminum oxide (γ-Al2O3)
and ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst modified using two-stage through dealumination
or desilication and by using the impregnation method with phosphorous
and lanthanum], weight hourly space velocity (WHSV), ethanol concentration,
and reaction temperature were investigated to obtain optimal reaction
conditions. The catalysts were characterized using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
method, temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia gas, thermogravimetric
analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction.
The results revealed that the ethylene yield and selectivity were
98.5 and 100%, respectively, for the ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst modified
through dealumination at a temperature of 220 °C and WHSV of
2.5 h–1 when the ethanol concentration was 95%.
The ethylene yield and selectivity were 94.3 and 94.4%, respectively,
for the ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst modified using phosphorous at a temperature
of 240 °C and WHSV of 1.5 h–1 when the ethanol
concentration was 20%. Both of these catalysts were the most favorable
among all prepared catalysts.

==== Body
Introduction
Ethylene is an essential chemical in the
petrochemical industry.
Ethylene is traditionally produced through the steam cracking of hydrocarbons,
and this method remains the predominant method in the industry.1 However, attention has been recently shifted
toward the use of green alternatives for ethylene production to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions and dependency on limited fossil fuels. Catalytic
bioethanol dehydration has been primarily used as a green alternative
for ethylene production.2 Bioethanol produced
from biomass fermentation is a potential alternative feedstock instead
of petroleum that is used as a chemical feedstock for ethylene production.
Therefore, dehydration of ethanol to ethylene has attracted increasing
attention. Bioethanol is a renewable and eco-friendly energy source
that can be produced from biomass such as hemicellulose.2 For example, the fast-growing fern genus Pteris is not of major economic importance but is
a reliable source of hemicellulose that can be converted to bioethanol.3

In the catalytic dehydration of ethanol
to ethylene, an acid catalyst
initially protonates the hydroxyl group, which leaves as a water molecule.
The conjugate base of the catalyst then deprotonates the methyl group,
and the hydrocarbon rearranges into ethylene. Because this reaction
is endothermic, maintaining a high reaction temperature ranging from
180 to 500 °C is essential. However, the industrial application
and maintenance of such a high reaction temperature constitute a considerable
portion of the energy cost because competing reactions into diethyl
ether or acetaldehyde are favored outside the temperature range and
thus reduce the ethylene yield. The dehydration reaction of ethanol
is given as follows 1  

This is the E1 reaction mechanism. In the initial
studies on the
dehydration of ethanol to ethylene, γ-alumina was used as a
catalyst for the reaction. Because a high reaction temperature of
450 °C is required and the yield of ethylene is relatively low
(80%), researchers have been focusing on modifying the catalyst to
reduce the reaction temperature and increase the ethylene yield to
make the reaction more economically efficient. Phillips Oil Co. (USA)
uses γ-alumina treated with KOH and ZnO/Al2O3 for ethylene production, and Halcon SD (USA) has been using
the MgO–Al2O3/SiO2-based SynDol
catalyst in their facilities.4 Bi et al.
(2010) reported that the nanoscale H-ZSM-5 zeolite powder (crystal
size: 50–100 nm; SiO2/Al2O3 = 26) can provide a conversion rate of 98.6% and an ethylene selectivity
of 99.2% at a reaction temperature of 240 °C.5 Moreover, the ability of H-ZSM-5 to catalyze the dehydration
of ethanol to ethylene at low temperatures (200–300 °C)
has made it commercially valuable and promising for further improvement
in its efficiency. ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts treated by dealumination
or desilication and modified with phosphorous or lanthanum have been
reported.6−9 For example, Xin et al. (2014) post-treated ZSM-5 zeolite powder
by desilication with sodium hydroxide, dealumination with oxalic acid,
or both in a sequential way to finely tune zeolite catalysts in a
hierarchical porous structure with varying acidities.8Table 1 summarizes
the ability of catalysts to dehydrate ethanol to ethylene.

Because the production concentration
of the bioethanol process
can reach 15–20%,3,10 we examined the ethanol
feed concentration of 20–95% by using diluted industrial ethanol
to simulate bioethanol. In view of saving technological energy, development
of a low-temperature (<240 °C) catalyst with a high catalytic
performance and stability is essential. In this study, we have developed
a ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst modified using two-stage to reduce the reaction
temperature and increase the ethylene selectivity and yield in ethanol
dehydration.

Results and Discussion
ZSM-5 zeolites
were promising from the perspective of industrial
applications, which is limited to unsatisfactory catalytic performance
and low anticoking ability.8 The modification
of ZSM-5 zeolites is more crucial to reduce their strong acidic sites.
With regard to the coke effect, the weak acidic site has more satisfactory
lifespan performance than the strong acidic site.8 The γ-Al2O3 catalyst can change
its structure to increase the number of acidic sites; however, the
increase in the number of acidic sites can reduce its catalytic lifespan.
Moreover, the γ-Al2O3 catalyst begins
to convert into other transitional phases at 500 °C.4

In this study, we first evaluated the dehydration
of ethanol to
ethylene by using commercial catalysts ZSM-5 (Zeolyst), Al2O3 (BASF), and γ-Al2O3/SiO2 (NKC). Ethanol conversion and ethylene selectivity were measured
at different reaction temperatures. The results obtained when the
feed ethanol concentration was 95% are graphically illustrated in Figure 1. A comparative study
of ZSM-5 (Zeolyst), γ-Al2O3 (BASF), and
γ-Al2O3/SiO2 (NKC) for ethanol
conversion and ethylene selectivity indicated a decreasing order for
the commercial catalysts: ZSM-5 > Al2O3 (BASF)
> γ-Al2O3/SiO2 (NKC). The
micropore
surface area (Smicro) for the ZSM-5 (Zeolyst),
Al2O3 (BASF), and γ-Al2O3/SiO2 (NKC) catalysts was 245, 20.1, and 0 m2/g, respectively.

and (D) ethylene selectivity vs reaction temperature for different
commercial catalysts. Ethanol(aq): 95 wt %, WHSV: 0.75
h–1, catalyst: 0.4 g, and carrier gas (N2): 30 mL/min.

Ethanol dehydration was
incomplete, and ethanol conversion was
low at lower temperatures. Furthermore, ethanol conversion for each
catalyst increased with an increase in the temperature. Ethanol conversion
for the γ-Al2O3/SiO2 (NKC)
catalyst at 350 and 450 °C was 66.9 and 97.1%, respectively.
The yield of the by-product (ether) exhibited a different tendency.
The ether yield decreased with an increase in the temperature. As
presented in Figure 1, the ethylene yield obtained using the ZSM-5 catalyst at 200 °C
was 0.51%. Furthermore, 85.6% of the ethylene yield was achieved when
the reaction temperature reached 280 °C. The ethylene yield obtained
using the ZSM-5 catalyst was higher than that obtained using other
catalysts. In addition, ethylene selectivity exhibited the same tendency.
Ethylene selectivity was low at lower temperatures because of diethyl
ether production. With an increase in the temperature, ethylene selectivity
increased with a concomitant decrease in the diethyl ether selectivity.
The maximum ethylene selectivity for the ZSM-5, Al2O3 (BASF), and γ-Al2O3/SiO2 (NKC) catalysts was 94.7, 94.5, and 51.2% at 280, 450, and 450 °C,
respectively. However, the disadvantage of the ZSM-5 catalyst was
its acidity, which reduced its stability and coking resistance. In
general, the ZSM-5 catalyst can be modified using desilication, dealumination,
phosphorous, and lanthanum to improve its efficiency in ethanol dehydration.
Thus, we modified the ZSM-5 catalyst by using four methods and studied
their reactivity.

Stability of the Catalyst in Ethanol Dehydration
Effect
of Time on Stream for Ethanol Concentration (95%)
The stability
of the catalysts in the dehydration of ethanol to ethylene
was examined under optimal reaction conditions, as listed in Table 2. Ethanol conversion
and ethylene selectivity decreased with the reaction time (Figures 2 and 3). As presented in Figure 2, the ZSM-5 catalyst had poor stability. However, the
ZSM-5-deAl-1/25 (220 °C), ZSM-5-La (240 °C), ZSM-5-P (240
°C), and Al2O3 (BASF; 350 °C) catalysts
had high stability. Ethanol conversion and ethylene selectivity for
all modified ZSM-5 catalysts were more than 99% after the reaction
time of 100 h (Table 2). This finding demonstrates that the ZSM-5-deAl-1/25 catalyst had
higher catalytic stability than the parent ZSM-5 catalyst (Figure 2). Furthermore, the
ZSM-5-deAl-1/25 catalyst had higher effective catalytic activity and
stability, and its ethylene yield, ethylene selectivity, and ethanol
conversion did not decrease after the reaction time of 100 h.

Effect of Time on Stream
for Ethanol Concentration (20–95%)
Figure 4 presents
the results of ethanol dehydration performed using the ZSM-5-deAl-1/25,
ZSM-5-La, and ZSM-5-P catalysts at different ethanol feed concentrations
(20–95%). The calculated ethanol conversion for ZSM-5-deAl-1/25,
ZSM-5-P, and ZSM-5-La was less than 5% when the ethanol feed concentration
for these three catalysts was 95% at 220 °C, 20, 60, and 95%
at 240 °C, and 95% at 240 °C, respectively, and their initial
ethanol conversion was 99, 95, and 95%, respectively.

Catalytic Performance Using Commercial and ZSM-5-Modified Catalysts
Tables 3, 4, and 5 list the effect of
temperature and weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) on ethanol conversion,
ethylene yield, ethylene selectivity, and space-time yield (STY) by
using the ZSM-5, ZSM-5-deAl, ZSM-5-P, ZSM-5-La, and Al2O3 (BASF) catalysts. The catalytic activity of all catalysts
became significant from 200 to 280 °C. STY is the amount of ethylene
synthesized per kg of the catalyst per hour. Table 3 lists the STY for different catalysts at
temperatures ranging from 220 to 280 °C. The results revealed
that the ZSM-5-deAl-1/50 catalyst has higher ethanol conversion and
STY when the reaction temperature was 240 and 280 °C.

The ethylene yield for the ZSM-5-deAl-1/25, ZSM-5-P,
ZSM-5-La,
ZSM-5-deAl-1/50, and ZSM-5-deAl-1/100 catalysts was approximately
94, 94, 91, 100, and 99%, respectively, when the reaction temperature
reached 240 °C. Furthermore, the ethylene yield for ZSM-5-deAl-1/25,
ZSM-5-P, and ZSM-5-La decreased to 29.8, 38.5, and 34.9%, respectively,
but that for ZSM-5-deAl-1/50 and ZSM-5-deAl-1/100 increased to 100
and 100%, respectively, when the reaction temperature was increased
to 280 °C. This finding indicates that the ethylene yield and
selectivity for the ZSM-5-deAl-1/25, ZSM-5-P, and ZSM-5-La catalysts
decreased when the reaction temperature was increased from 240 to
280 °C. This could be attributable to the increased production
of by-products at a reaction temperature of 280 °C.

The
dehydration of ethanol by the acidic catalysts competitively
form ethane and diethyl ether. For Al2O3 (BASF)
and ZSM-5 (Zeolyst) in Table 3, the selectivity of ethylene increases with increasing reaction
temperature. High reaction temperatures are propitious to the ethylene
formation via intramolecular dehydration, whereas low temperatures
are favorable to diethyl ether via intermolecular dehydration. At
low temperatures, not only the catalyst activity is poor but also
the selectivity of ethylene is low because of a large amount of ethanol
being converted to diethyl ether. The selectivity of ethylene for
the other ZSM-5 modified catalysts is of the same trend, but higher
temperature is decreased. The liquid hourly space velocities (LHSVs)
in the traditional fixed-bed reactor are as low as 0.2–0.4
h–1 because of the heat transfer and intrinsic reaction
rate limitations.4Table 4 shows that the selectivity of ethylene is
decreased when the WHSV is larger than 2.5, but the selectivity of
diethyl ether behaved in the opposite way.

Ethanol conversion
for the ZSM-5, ZSM-5-deAl-1/50, ZSM-5-deAl-1/100,
ZSM-5-P, ZSM-5-La, and Al2O3 (BASF) catalysts
did not improve when the reaction temperature was decreased to 220
°C. However, the ethylene yield for the ZSM-5-deAl-1/25 catalyst
was 96.3% at a reaction temperature of 220 °C. At a low reaction
temperature (220 °C), the STY for the ZSM-5-deAl-1/25 catalyst
was higher than that for other catalysts. Hence, the ZSM-5-deAl-1/25
catalyst was assessed at different temperatures and WHSVs when the
feed ethanol concentration was 95% (Table 4). When the reaction temperature was 240
°C and WHSV was 4.0 h–1, STY was 2160 g kg–1 h–1, but the ethylene yield was
88.4%. When the reaction temperature was decreased to 220 °C
and WHSV was 2.5 h–1, the ethylene yield increased
to 98.5% and STY was 1512 g kg–1 h–1. The ethylene yield and selectivity were 98.5 and 100%, respectively,
for the ZSM-5-deAl-1/25 catalyst under optimal conditions (temperature
of 220 °C and WHSV of 2.5 h–1). Table 5 depicts the reaction performance
of ethanol dehydration at a low-feed ethanol concentration (20–60%).
The performance of the ZSM-5-P catalyst was excellent when the reaction
temperature was 240 °C and the feed ethanol concentration was
20%. The conversion of ethanol decreases with the decreasing concentration
of ethanol in the feed, especially when the temperatures are lower
than 220 °C, using ZSM-5-deAl-1/25. The selectivity of ethylene
decreases with decreasing ethanol concentration, whereas the selectivity
of ethyl ether is on the contrary. This may be because of competitive
adsorption of water and ethanol on the active sites of the catalyst
surface. The ZSM-5 catalyst modified with dealumination, phosphorous,
or lanthanum can increase the ethylene selectivity at lower temperature,
particularly the ZSM-5-deAl catalyst modified using two-stage.

The results of the comparison of catalysts examined in this study
with those examined in previous studies are listed in Table 1. The ZSM-5-deAl-1/25 catalyst
had the most efficient catalytic performance and anticoking ability.
When the ZSM-5-deAl-1/25 catalyst was used at a WHSV of 2.5 h–1 and a temperature of 220 °C, the ethanol conversion,
ethylene yield, ethylene selectivity, and STY were 98.1, 98.5, 100%,
and 1512 g kg–1 h–1, respectively,
and the time on stream was 100 h.

Characterization of the
Catalysts
The catalysts were
characterized through temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), micropore
size, and surface area analyses by using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA).

Crystallinity of the Catalysts
As presented in Figure 4, the XRD patterns
of the five samples exhibited well-resolved diffraction peaks that
were characteristic of the mordenite framework inverted structure.
The relative crystallinity was calculated according to the aggregate
intensities of the three peaks at 2θ of 23.07°, 23.28°,
and 23.90°. The three-peak intensities of the parent ZSM-5 zeolites
were considered to be 100% crystalline. The XRD crystallinity of the
ZSM-5-deSi catalyst exhibited a decrease from that of the ZSM-5 peak
intensity of 2θ = 23–25°. The XRD crystallinity
of the ZSM-5 catalysts decreased to 48.2% (ZSM-deSi), and the crystallinity
of ZSM-5-deAl was quite close to that of ZSM-5-La and ZSM-5-P. Compared
with the ZSM-5-P catalyst, the long-range integrity of the ZSM-5-La
catalyst was relatively small. The decrease in the crystallinity of
the ZSM-5-deSi catalyst may be attributable to substantial changes
in lattice parameters caused by post-treatments.

Acidic Properties
of the Catalysts
NH3-TPD
was used to characterize the acidic properties of the catalysts. We
observed two NH3 desorption peaks for the ZSM-5, ZSM-5-P,
ZSM-5-deSi, ZSM-5-deAl-1/25, and ZSM-5-deAl-1/100 catalysts (Figure 5). Regarding NH3-TPD patterns, the NH3 desorption temperature below
and above 300 °C corresponded to weak and strong acidic sites,
respectively.11 The centering of low-temperature
desorption peaks at 200 °C and high-temperature desorption peaks
at 400 °C was attributable to weak acidic sites and binding of
NH3 to strong acidic sites, respectively. For the five
catalysts, the number of weak acidic sites was higher than that of
strong acidic sites. Compared with the parent ZSM-5 catalyst, the
ZSM-5 modified catalysts exhibited higher desorption temperature in
the strong acidic sites, indicating that the strength of acidic sites
increased by post-treatment.12 Upon desilication,
the ZSM-5-deSi catalyst had lower number of weak and strong acidic
sites than the parent ZSM-5 catalyst because the structure of the
ZSM-5-deSi catalyst was destroyed (Figure 4). The desilication reaction may be conducted
under relatively mild conditions to enhance the acidic sites.

Figure 5 NH3-TPD profiles of differently modified ZSM-5 catalysts.

Intermolecular dehydration of ethanol is a comprehensive
and synergistic
effect of weak and strong acidic sites. An increase in the number
of weak acidic sites and in the acidity of both weak and strong acidic
sites was beneficial to the catalytic activity for dehydration of
ethanol to ethylene. However, strong acidity can lead to ethylene
polymerization.13 Thus, the ZSM-5-deAl-1/25
catalyst had a high intensity and desorption temperature. Of course,
except the acid strength (strong or weak), the acidity type (Brønsted
or Lewis) and acid amount strongly determine the catalytic performance.
They also need to be considered for the stability of the catalyst
and the selectivity of the product (ethylene) in industrial applications.
Chemisorption of basic molecules such as pyridine using Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR)14 and state-of-the-art
solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)15 are often used to determine the surface acidity of zeolite catalysts.
The amount of pyridine retained after the desorption process is related
to the Brønsted acidity of the catalyst. The Brønsted acidity
and Lewis acidity of the spent (8 h) and fresh catalysts analyzed
using FTIR were 205 and 24 and 236 and 31 μmol/g, respectively,
at the peaks of 1545 and 1455 cm–1.

Surface Area
of the Catalyst
The Smicro and
pore volume size (Vmicro) can affect the
catalyst in the ethanol to ethylene reaction. The
coke effect is increased with a decrease in the Smicro and Vmicro. Moreover,
the catalyst activity decreases with an increase in the coke effect.
The coke effect can block the Smicro and Vmicro and thus reduce the catalytic activity.11Table 6 lists the Smicro and Vmicro of the ZSM-5, ZSM-5-P, ZSM-5-La, ZSM-5-deAl-1/25,
ZSM-5-deAl-1/50, ZSM-5-deAl-1/100, Al2O3 (BASF),
and γ-Al2O3/SiO2 (NKC) catalysts.
The pore characteristics of the fresh and spent catalysts were studied
through the N2 adsorption–desorption technique.

The pore size diameters ranging from 2 to 50 nm, less
than 2 nm,
and more than 50 nm are considered mesoporous, microporous, and macroporous,
respectively. The Smicro and Vmicro of ZSM-5 were 245 m2/g and 0.13 cm3/g, respectively, which decreased to 160 m2/g (34%
decrease) and 0.08 cm3/g, respectively, after the reaction.
A high amount of coke deposition was observed on the spent ZSM-5 catalyst,
which blocked the catalyst channel during the reaction. The Smicro and Vmicro of the ZSM-5-deAl-1/25 catalyst were 206 m2/g and 0.11
cm3/g, respectively, which decreased to 188–192
m2/g (10% decrease) and 0.10 cm3/g, respectively,
after the reaction. Compared to the result in Table 3, the selectivity of ethylene increases with
increasing mesoporous structure, that is, decreasing Smicro and Vmicro.

XPS Profiles of the Catalysts
The XPS spectra revealed
a band for Na 1s, Al 2p, P 2p, and La 3d at binding energies between
1100 and 1080 eV, 84 and 68 eV, 140 and 125 eV, and 870 and 830 eV,
respectively. In addition, the spectra demonstrated a main band (Si
2p) at a binding energy between 108 and 100 eV. The peak at 104 eV
was associated with the bond Si groups. Table 7 summarizes the mass surface concentration
(C 1s, O 1s, and Si 2p) obtained through the XPS analysis of carbon,
oxygen, and silicon. The amount of surface carbon and oxygen was approximately
13.6–30.2% and 42.1–51.9%, respectively. The amount
of surface silicon ranged from 27.3 to 34.4%. The amount of silicon
decreased in the modified ZSM-5-deAl, ZSM-5-deSi, ZSM-5-P, and ZSM-5-La
catalysts. For the ZSM-5-deSi catalyst, the decrease in the amount
of silicon was 7.1% and the increase in the amount of carbon was 16.6%.
The desilication of the ZSM-5 catalyst resulted in a shift in the
maximum of the Si 2p band to lower binding energies, indicating a
decrease in the proportion of oxidized silicon groups. This behavior
indicated that the desilication method made the catalyst inactive
and reduced its performance.

Coke Deposition on the Surface of the Catalyst
TGA
was performed to examine coke deposition in the Al2O3 (BASF), ZSM-5, ZSM-5-P, ZSM-5-La, and ZSM-5-deAl-1/25 catalysts
after the reaction (Figure 6). The total weight loss at a temperature of 800 °C for
the ZSM-5-deAl-1/25-95%, ZSM-5-deAl-1/25-20%, ZSM-5-P ZSM-5-deAl-1/25-60%,
ZSM-5, ZSM-5-La, and Al2O3 (BASF) catalysts
was 2.09, 2.60, 2.86, 3.15, 3.33, 4.20, and 5.48 wt %, respectively.
The weight loss below the temperature of 150 °C is attributable
to physically adsorbed water in porous materials. The weight loss
at temperatures of 200–800 °C is attributable to the burning
of heavy coke. The amount of coke deposition for the ZSM-5 catalyst
was higher than that for the ZSM-5-deAl-1/25-95% catalyst. This explains
the reason for the high stability of the ZSM-5-deAl-1/25 catalyst.

Figure 6 TGA curves
of used catalysts: BASF, ZSM-5, ZSM-5-P, ZSM-5-La, and
ZSM-5-deAl-1/25 under 20–95 wt % feedstock/100 h.

A decrease in the Smicro and Vmicro is caused by coke deposition
(Table 6). The blockage
of
the channel by coke deposition over the spent ZSM-5 catalyst restricts
the access of reactants or intermediates to the internal active sites
of the catalyst. The loss of Smicro in
the spent ZSM-5 and ZSM-5-deAl-1/25 catalysts was 85.2 and 18.1 m2/g, respectively. The decrease in the percentage of Smicro of the ZSM-5, ZSM-5-P, ZSM-5-La, ZSM-5-deAl-1/25,
ZSM-5-deAl-1/50, and Al2O3 (BASF) catalysts
was 34.7, 12.1, 28.9, 8.74, 9.35, and 100%, respectively.

A
high loss of Smicro in the catalysts
suggests that the coke precursors or the coke produced during the
reaction procedure tends to deposit in the newly created micropores.
Therefore, the newly created micropores may accommodate a part of
coke deposition, consequently reducing the formation of coke deposition
in its inherent micropores to some extent. We observed a reduction
in the micropore blockage in the ZSM-5-deAl-1/25 zeolites. Because
of the reduction in the micropore blockage in the spent ZSM-5-deAl-1/25
catalyst, most active sites were still accessible to reactants and
intermediates. Therefore, ethanol conversion for the ZSM-5-deAl-1/25
catalyst was much higher than that for the ZSM-5 catalyst when the
feed concentration of ethanol was 95%.

Performance of ZSM-5-deAl
Figure 7 presents
the simulation for the dehydration
of ethanol to ethylene by using ASPEN software under the following
reaction conditions: 180–500 °C, ethanol feed concentration
= 95%, ethanol feed rate = 0.013 mL/min, and pressure = 1 atm. The
reaction formula is as follows 2   3  

Figure 7 Simulation plot of ethanol conversion and product yield

temperature in ethanol dehydration using ASPEN software. The solid
line (—○—) is the result obtained with the
ZSM-5-deAl-1/25 catalyst; WHSV = 2.5 h–1 and ethanol
feed concentration = 95%.

The simulation for the dehydration of ethanol indicates that
ethanol
conversion decreased below 220 °C. By comparing the simulation
results with this study results, we observed that the aforementioned
conditions are optimal for ethanol dehydration.

Conclusions
The modification of the ZSM-5 catalyst by using the dealumination
method improved its catalytic performance and anticoking ability for
the dehydration of ethanol to ethylene at a low temperature, which
could be attributable to the tuned acidic sites, pore structure, and
synergistic interaction with aluminum. The ZSM-5-deAl-1/25 and ZSM-5-P
catalysts restricted the formation of coke, which can lead to the
activation of the catalysts, and an increase in the stability of the
catalysts. The most favorable ethylene yield and selectivity (98.5
and 100%, respectively) for the ZSM-5-deAl-1/25 catalyst were obtained
at a WHSV of 2.5 h–1, lifespan reaction time of
100 h, reaction temperature of 220 °C, and ethanol feed concentration
of 95% and for the ZSM-5-P catalyst at a lifespan reaction time of
100 h, WHSV of 1.5 h–1, reaction temperature of
240 °C, and ethanol feed concentration of 20%. The mesoporous
structure of the catalyst and a strong acidic site (high temperature
in NH3TCD) can enhance the catalytic stability and ethylene
selectivity.

Experimental Section
Materials
We purchased
zeolite ammonium ZSM-5 (CBV28014,
SiO2/A2O3 mole ratio = 280, surface
area = 400 m2/g, and cation form = ammonium) from Zeolyst
International (Valley Forge, USA), ethanol (95%) from Echo Chemical
(Miaoli, Taiwan), ammonium phosphate and aluminum nitrate-9-hydrate
(99%) from J.T. Baker (Mexico, USA), ammonium nitrate and lanthanum
nitrate hexahydrate from Sigma (Utah’s Salt Lake, USA), and
ethylene (99%) from Ming Yang (Taoyuan, Taiwan). The reagents were
used as supplied by the manufacturer.

Preparation of the Catalyst
Preparation
of the ZSM-5-deSi Catalyst
We performed
the desilication treatment of the ZSM-5 catalyst (3.3 g) by vigorously
stirring it in 100 mL of aqueous NaOH (0.2 M) solution in a flask
at 65 °C for 30 min, followed by filtration and thorough washing
with deionized (DI) water. The solid sample was isolated and dried
at 100 °C for 24 h in an oven. Then, we mixed the sample (1 g)
in 30 mL of NH4NO3 (1 M) solution and stirred
it vigorously. We placed the sample in a boat quartz tube and then
subsequently calcined it in static air from room temperature to 550
°C (ramp rate of 1 °C/min). After calcination, we placed
the catalyst in a sample bottle and maintained the bottle at room
temperature.

Preparation of the ZSM-5-deAl Catalyst Modified
Using Two-Stage
First stage: the dealumination treatment
of the ZSM-5 catalyst
(1.0 g) was carried out in 50 mL of aqueous oxalic acid (0.5 M) solution
in a flask and then heated to 120 °C for 2 h. The solid product
was filtered and dried at 100 °C for 24 h in an oven. Second
stage: then, we mixed 1 g of the filtered sample in 25, 50, and 100
mL of oxalic acid solution (0.5 M) separately, vigorously stirred
it, and named them ZSM-5-deAl-1/25, ZSM-5-deAl-1/50, and ZSM-5-deAl-1/100,
respectively. Furthermore, we calcined these samples in static air
from room temperature to 550 °C (ramp rate of 1 °C/min).

Preparation of the Phosphorous- and Lanthanum-Modified Catalyst
The phosphorous (ZSM-5-P) or lanthanum (ZSM-5-La) treatment of
the ZSM-5 catalyst (1 g) was performed by suspending the catalyst
in 50 mL of DI water and then adding the desired volume (100 mL, 1
wt %) of aqueous (NH4)2HPO4 or La(NO3)3·6H2O (0.02 M) solution, respectively.
After agitation at 60 °C for 6 h, the excess water was removed
under reduced pressure. The residue was dried at 60 °C in an
oven and then calcined at 500 °C for 6 h.

Activity of
Ethanol Dehydration
Figure 8 presents the schematic of the experimental
apparatus. The dehydration reaction was performed in a fixed-bed reactor.
First, 0.4 g of 60–80-mesh catalyst particles was added in
a U-type quartz tube (diameter, 1 cm and length, 24 cm) isolated by
silicon carbide cotton and then placed in an electrically heated furnace.
The temperature was controlled using a microprocessor-based temperature
controller through a K-type thermocouple (Maxthermo, MC-2438, Taiwan).
Ethanol (20, 60, or 95%) was injected into the reactor by using a
liquid pump (LC-10A, Shimadzu, Japan) under a nitrogen carrier gas
flow rate of 30 mL/min. The WHSV of ethanol was set at a selected
value (0.75–6.0 h–1).

Figure 8 Schematic of experimental
apparatus. (A) N2, (B) flow
controller, (C) liquid chromatography pump, (D) evaporator, (E) evaporator,
(F) temperature controller, (G) U-type fixed-bed reactor, (H) condenser
(0.2 °C), (I) flow meter, (J) dilute tube, and (K) GC with FID.

Ethanol and the condensate from
the condenser (Figure 8H) were determined using a
gas chromatography–flame ionization detector (GC–FID;
GC2014, Shimadzu, Japan) equipped with a column of 7HK-G013-22 ZB-WAX
(length, 30 m; i.d., 0.53 mm; and film, 1 μm; Zebra, Los Angeles,
USA) under nitrogen carrier gas (30 mL/min). The oven temperature
was set at 50–100 °C (ramp rate of 10 °C/min). The
sample was withdrawn at a time interval of 1 h. C2H4 and (C2H5)2O obtained from
the dilute tube (Figure 8J) were determined using a GC–FID (GC14B, Shimadzu, Japan)
equipped with a column of Porapak-Q-141023J (length, 3 m and i.d.,
2 mm; Quadrex, Bethany, USA) under a nitrogen carrier gas flow rate
of 30 mL/min. The oven temperature was set at 180 °C. The sample
was withdrawn at a time interval of 1 h.

Calculation of the Conversion
and Yield of Ethylene and Ether
WHSV is defined as the ratio
of the hourly feed flow rate of ethanol
and water mixture to the catalyst weight. The ethanol conversion (Xethanol), ethylene selectivity (Sethylene), ether yield (Yether), and ethylene yield (Yethylene) are
defined as follows 4   5   6   7  where Me, Me0, Me1, and Me2 are the molar amounts of ethanol after the
reaction, ethanol before the reaction, ethanol converted into ethylene,
and ether after the reaction, respectively.

Characterization of the
Catalytic Property
The acidity
and its distribution were analyzed through ammonia (NH3) adsorption and TPD of NH3 gas (NH3-TPD; Micromeritics,
AutoChem 2950 HP, USA). We heated 0.1 g of the catalyst sample for
1 h at 500 °C under a helium flow rate of 40 mL/min and then
held it at 100 °C for impulse NH3 adsorption. When
the saturated adsorption was achieved, the system was swept with helium
for 15 min. Then, the temperature was programmed to increase to 700
°C at a ramp rate of 10 °C/min. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption
isotherm was measured at −196 °C on ASAP 2020 (Micromeritics,
USA). Before measurement, the sample was degassed in vacuum at 200
°C for 200 min (ramp rate of 10 °C/min). The BET method
was used to calculate the specific surface area by using the adsorption
data in a relative pressure ranging from 0.02 to 0.25. XRD patterns
were recorded on a D/max-2500 X-ray diffractometer (Shimadzu Labx
XRD-6000, Japan) with Cu Kα radiation by using 0.1 g of the
catalyst and instrumental settings of 40 kV and 40 mA. The scanning
range was from 10° to 90° at a ramp rate of 10°/min.
The surface chemistry of the samples was analyzed through XPS. The
XPS analyses of the samples were obtained using a 5700C model Physical
Electronics apparatus (PerkinElmer, USA) with Mg Kα radiation
(1253.6 eV) by using 0.1 g of the catalyst. The XPS peaks were fitted
using least squares with Gaussian–Lorentzian peak shapes. The
thermal property of the samples after the reaction was measured using
TGA (TA Instruments Q50, USA) to monitor the amount of coke deposition.
The samples were heated from room temperature to 800 °C at a
ramp rate of 10 °C/min under a nitrogen flow. For the FTIR analysis,
approximately 25 mg of the sample and 1 g of KBr were weighed, milled,
and ground in an agate mortar, until a fine powder with a uniform
particle size was obtained. It was then pressed with a steel die to
obtain a thin wafer. The wafers of fresh and used catalysts were activated
in situ in an infrared cell under vacuum (10–6 mbar)
at 623 K (fresh sample) and 423 K (coked samples) for 2 h and then
cooled to room temperature. After the saturated adsorption of pyridine
at room temperature, the sample was desorbed under vacuum at 423,
573, and 723 K. The FTIR spectra were recorded in the transmission
mode with a resolution of 4 cm–1.
