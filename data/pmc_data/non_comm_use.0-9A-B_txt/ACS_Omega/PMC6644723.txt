With an appropriate
catalyst, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)
by water splitting can be used to produce hydrogen gas. Recently,
layered transition-metal dichalcogenides have been proposed as alternative
HER catalysts. However, a significant challenge is how to obtain the
high-density active sites. With first-principle calculations, we explore
the possibility of defect engineering to trigger the HER catalytic
activity of basal plane by analyzing monolayer PdSe2, PtSe2, PdTe2, and PtTe2. It is found that
the double-vacancy DVSe (DVTe) and B-doping
can modulate appropriately the interaction between H and basal plane
and improve the HER activity of these transition-metal dichalcogenides.
Especially, the B-doping with high concentration can increase enormously
the density of active sites on basal plane.

1 Introduction
Hydrogen as an energy carrier can be used to produce clean electricity
in hydrogen fuel cells.1 Among different
hydrogen production methods, electrolytic water as a sustainable one
has been concerned.2−5 The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), as the cathodic half-reaction
of water splitting, is vital for the production of hydrogen gas. In
acidic condition, the total HER includes two processes.6 The first step is hydrogen adsorption onto a
catalyst by Volmer reaction with H+ + e– → H*, where the prefix of * represents the adsorption site
of the catalyst. The second step is releasing of molecular hydrogen
through two different mechanisms, Heyrovsky reaction H* + H+ + e– → H2+* and Tafel
reaction 2H* → H2 + 2*. To decrease the overpotential
and thus accelerate the reaction rate, searching for high-efficiency
electric catalysts to reduce the reaction barrier becomes important
in this filed. Platinum is the most electrochemically stable catalyst
and exerts excellent HER electrocatalytic performance.7−9 However, the high cost and earth-scarcity have hindered its widespread
use. It is urgent to find new efficient and abundant electrocatalyst
for HER.

The two-dimensional materials, such as layered transition
metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs), have been reported to exhibit superior catalytic
properties for the electrocatalytic applications and emerged as alternative
to Pt.10−25 As a prototype, MoS2 with different phase structures
(such as 1T′ and 2H) has been widely studied.26−29 It has been found that the basal plane of MoS2 is catalytically
inert and the catalytic activity originates from the sulfur-terminated
Mo-edge and S-edge state for 2H phase.29−31 To enhance the catalytic
performance of MoS2 catalysts, it is considered critical to be make
a substantial fraction of exposed edge sites. Synthesizing the nanostructures,
such as nanoflakes,32 nanoparticles,11 and nanowires,33 has
been the typical method at present. Because of the thermodynamic stability
of basal plane and the dominant exposed surface of monolayer TMDs,
another strategy is to activate the basal plane of TMDs through defect
engineering and/or phase engineering.34−39 For example, with 1T′ phase, MoS2 exhibits metallic
characteristic. Phase transition from 2H to 1T′ has been investigated
as a method of tuning electronic properties to improve the HER activity.
Defect engineering is also expected to activate the inert basal plane.
It have been found that introducing the S vacancies and strain could
activate the basal plane of monolayer 2H-MoS2 for HER.40 The doping with transition metal and light element
has been proposed to improve the catalytic activity of inert basal
plane.41−44 In fact, various structural defects, such as point defects and grain
boundaries, have been observed in two-dimensional (2D) materials,
and were proposed to bring additional active sites for monolayer TMDs
to improve the HER ratio.35

Recently,
platinum- and palladium-based dichalcogenides were synthesized
and proposed to be as the catalysts for HER.45 In this work, we explored the way of defect engineering to activate
the basal plane of PdSe2, PtSe2, PdTe2, and PtTe2 for HER by first-principle calculations combined
with the basic theory about HER. We mainly investigated the HER activity
of basal plane by introducing different kinds of vacancies and the
B-doping in monolayer. First, we analyzed the formation of different
vacancies and the possibility of B-doping. Then, we simulated the
different configurations of H-adsorption around the defects. By the
analysis of electronic properties of defect structures, the atomic
mechanism of interaction between H and defects was explored. Finally,
with the relative free energy of H at the absorption state as the
indicator and Sabatier principle, we analyzed the effect of different
defects in four materials on HER catalytic activity. These results
indicate that defect engineering, especially the B-doping, is an effective
method to activate the basal plane of PdSe2, PtSe2, PdTe2, and PtTe2 and make them excellent
HER catalysts.

2 Calculation Methods and Theoretical
Models
We carried out the density functional theory calculations
by using
the Vienna ab initio simulation package.46 The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of the parameterization
of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) was used as the exchange–correlation
functional.47 The kinetic energy cutoff
was set to 500 eV. The k-point grid was generated
with the spacing of 0.02 Å–1 under Monkhorst–Pack
scheme.48 The criterion of energy convergence
was set to be 10–5 eV. All the atomic relaxation
was terminated until the Hellmann–Feynman forces were smaller
than 0.01 eV/Å. The vacuum layer was set to be larger than 18
Å, enough to separate the neighboring layers.

The primitive
cells of monolayer PdSe2, PtSe2, PdTe2, and PtTe2 are relaxed to the equilibrium
structures. All the calculated structural parameters and electronic
properties are shown in Table 1. The calculated lattice constants are consistent with the
experimental values.45 The bond length
of Pt–Se is similar to that of Pd–Se, and the bond length
of Pt–Te is similar to that of Pd–Te. All the four monolayers
are semiconductors.

PdSe2	3.74	2.53	–1.07	0.73

To analyze the defect effect, we considered four kinds
of defect
structures, including single-vacancy of metal atom (VPd and VPt), single-vacancy of nonmetallic atom (VSe and VTe), double vacancy (DVSe and DVTe), and the B-doping (BSe and BTe).
Here, we chose boron as the doping element mainly due to the obvious
difference of electronegativity between B and Se (Te). It is expected
that the B-doping can introduce the band gap states to active the
basal plane. With PtSe2 as an example, these defect models
are shown in Figure 1. These defect models are constructed in a 4 × 4 supercell.
To assess the thermodynamic stability of these defect structures,
we analyzed the formation energies of defects. The formation energy
is calculated by the formula49 1  where ED and EP are the total energies
of the monolayer dichalcogenides
with defect structure and pristine structure in the same supercell,
respectively. μi is the chemical
potential of atom type i and Δni is the difference of number of atom
type i in the pristine structure and defect structure.
With PdSe2 as an example, we considered Se as the experimental
parameter to analyze the formation of these defects. Under the thermodynamic
equilibrium, the chemical potential of Se (μSe) is
set in the range of [μSe(bulk) + ΔHf/2, μSe(bulk)]. Here, ΔHf is the formation heat of PdSe2 and
defined by the formula, ΔHf = EPdSe2 – EPd – 2ESe, in which EPdSe2, EPd, and ESe are the total energies of single-layer
PdSe2, bulk Pd, and bulk S. The upper limit of μSe corresponds to the Se-rich condition and the down limit
corresponds to the Pd-rich condition. For the B-doping, the chemical
potential of B (μB) is set to that of bulk α-B.

pristine structure and different kinds of defects including (b) single
vacancy of metal atom (VPt), (c) single vacancy of nonmetallic
atom (VSe), (d) double vacancy (DVSe), and (e)
the B-doping (BSe). Note that the numbers around the defect
represent the potential adsorption positions of H around defects considered
in this work. The structures of defect models in PdSe2,
PdTe2, and PtTe2 are similar to that in PtSe2.

To get an insight into the HER
catalytic activity by the interaction
between H and the catalyst, we analyzed the adsorption energy on the
potential active sites of the surface. The adsorption energy is defined
by the formula 2  where Ehost+H and Ehost are the total
energies of substrate material
with and without H-adsorption, respectively. EH denotes the energy of isolated H atom.

The total HER
can be expressed as 2H+ + 2e– →
H2. At equilibrium state, the free energy of
the initial state and the final state in the reaction should be equivalent.
Therefore, the free energy of the intermediate state H* (H adsorbed
on the active site of catalyst) is important for the reaction rate.
As an important indicator of the HER activity, the relative free energy
of H* with the initial state or the finial state as the reference
can be expressed as , where Ecat+H and Ecat are the total
energies of the
catalysts with and without H-adsorption, respectively. EH2 is the total energy of H2 molecule.
ΔEZPE is the difference of zero-point
energies between the intermediate H* and the finial state. ΔS is the entropy difference of both states. Following the
work of Nørskov et al., the contribution of vibrational entropy
from H in the intermediate H* is small and can be ignored.6 ΔS can be calculated on
the basis of the entropy of gas phase at standard conditions and TΔS at 300 K is about −0.2
eV. The contribution of ΔEZPE to
free energy for H-adsorption is usually small and about 0.04 eV for
H on Cu(111) surface. Therefore, the relative free energy can be approximately
calculated by the formula6 3  For ΔGH*, the positive
value will obstruct
the adsorption process and the negative value will restrict the desorption.
Both cases hinder the HER rate.6,50,51 According to Sabatier principle, the optimal value should be a thermoneutral
value, ΔGH* ≈ 0.

The theoretical exchange current density
(i0) is calculated on the basis of ΔGH*. The theoretical
exchange
current density can reveal the reaction rate during the proton transfer
to the surface to some extent.6 If the
proton transfer is exothermic (ΔGH* < 0), the exchange current expression
at standard conditions with pH = 0 and T = 300 K
is 4  By contrast, if the reaction is endothermic
(ΔGH* > 0), the exchange current density is calculated by 5  where k0 is the
rate constant (200 s–1/site) and k is Boltzmann constant.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Defects and B-Doping
In 2D materials,
vacancy as a typical point defect is popular. We analyzed two kinds
of single vacancies in PdSe2, PtSe2, PdTe2, and PtTe2, as shown in Figure 2. From the formation energy, whatever the
condition of Pd-rich (Pt-rich) or Se-rich (Te-rich), the single-vacancy
VSe (VTe) is more stable than VPd (VPt). It is also noticed that these nonmetal vacancies
have low formation energy (less than 2 eV). This implies that they
are a common type of defects in the process of experimental synthesis,
especially under the condition of rich Pd to synthesize PdTe2.

Figure 2 Defect formation energy as a function of chemical potential for
different materials including (a) PdSe2, (b) PdTe2, (c) PtSe2, (d) PtTe2, and (e) formation energy
of B substitution (BSe for PdSe2 and PtSe2, BTe for PdTe2 and PtTe2) as a function of chemical potential calculated on the basis of
the pristine structure in Figure 1a and single-vacancy structure in Figure 1c. Note that the formation
energy of B substitution calculated on the basis of single-vacancy
structure does not change by following the chemical potential of Te
(Se) in (e).

Compared to the single
vacancy VSe (or VTe), the formation of double
vacancy (DVSe or DVTe) is a little difficult.
In addition, in Figure 2, it is found that the isolated single vacancies
are more popular than one double vacancy by comparing the formation
energies of one double vacancy DVSe (DVTe) and
two isolated single vacancies (V2Se or V2Te)
at the same Se (Te) concentration. This suggests the single vacancy
VSe (VTe) is dominant in PdSe2, PtSe2, PdTe2, and PtTe2.

For the B-doping,
the popular way is the replacement of Se (Te)
by B because B is easier to bond with Pt (Pd) than with Se (Te). The
formation energy was calculated as presented in Figure 2e. For the four layered-compounds we considered,
in B-rich condition, the B substitution becomes possible due to the
low formation energy. Especially, in PtTe2, the formation
energy of BTe is less than 1.8 eV. It is also possible
that B will occupy the single vacancy VSe (VTe) because it is popular in the synthesis processes. With the single
vacancy VSe (VTe), we found that B would likely
be absorbed on the vacancy to form the defect BTe (BSe). Especially, in PtSe2, the formation energy
is very low and less than 0.2 eV.

3.2 H-Adsorption
and Electronic Properties of
Defective Structures
To consider the adsorption in the proposed
four kinds of defective models, we analyzed all the possible adsorption
sites with the consideration of structural symmetry for each defective
model. These adsorption sites are marked by a number, as shown in Figure 1. The results are
listed in Table S1. For the pristine structure,
the most stable adsorption site of H is at the top of Se (Te) atom
for all the considered materials. For the VPd (VPt) model, the adsorbed H atom is located at the Se (Te) atom near
VPd (VPt), except PdSe2. For the
VSe (VTe) model, the adsorbed H atom tends to
occupy the top site of the Pd (Pt) atom near VSe (VTe). In the case of double-vacancy DVSe (DVTe) model, there are two kinds of Pd (Pt) atoms near DVSe (DVTe), which are four-coordinated and five-coordinated,
respectively. The adsorbed H atom is located at the middle site of
the double vacancy and the H atom prefers to bind with four-coordinated
Pd (Pt) atom, as shown in Figure S1c. For
the B-doping model, H atom is adsorbed above the bridge site between
B and Pd (Pt).

For each model in four compounds, the adsorption
energy of most stable adsorption configuration is demonstrated in Figure 3. From the adsorption
energies of hydrogen on different materials with various defects,
we come to a conclusion that the adsorption energy of VPd (VPt) is the largest among the considered various defect
types. It means that the interaction between Se (Te) near the defect
and H in the VPd (VPt) model is strong, especially
in PdSe2. Meanwhile, the interaction strength between H
and other types of defects is similar.

Figure 3 Adsorption energy of
H for monolayer PdSe2, PtSe2, PdTe2, and PtTe2 with various defects
in the most stable configuration.

It is noticed that the interaction between H and the defects
is
stronger than that of H and pristine PdSe2 (PtSe2, PdTe2, and PtTe2). To understand the atomic
mechanism of interaction between H and the defects, we analyzed the
change in electronic properties due to the defects. Taking PdSe2 for example, the density of states (DOS) and partial density
of states (PDOS) of VPd, VSe, VSe2, and BSe are plotted in Figure 4. The electronic band structure in Figure S2a demonstrates that pristine PdSe2 is a semiconductor with a band gap of about 0.7 eV. For VPd in Figure 4a, a quasi-localized state appears in the region of band gap. Fermi
level is anchored at the middle of quasi-localized state. From the
PDOS, this defect state can be attributed to the Se near VPd. To observe the distribution of charge in real space, we plotted
the differential charge density in Figure 5. As shown in Figure 5a, from the charge distribution, the polarized
covalent bond is formed between Pd and Se atom with the surplus charge
transferred from Pd to Se. With VPd, there is charge accumulation
near the unsaturated Se atom near the vacancy. With the H-adsorption
near the defect, the hydrogen interacts with the localized electronic
states from Se near VPd, as shown in Figures S1a and S3a. In addition, H also traps the other Se
atom near VPd in PdSe2, resulting in the weakening
of the Pd–Se bond near VPd. This phenomenon is not
observed in other three compounds (Figure S4). It may be the reason why the absorption strength at VPd of PdSe2 is the largest.

of states (PDOS) of
PdSe2 with various defects including (a) VPd, (b) VSe, (c) VSe2, and (d) BSe.

Figure 5 Differential charge density of PdSe2 with various defects
including (a) VPd, (b) VSe, (c) VSe2, and (d) BSe. Note that dark red color indicates
charge accumulation and green color denotes charge depletion.

The localized states with high
PDOS, such as the edge states from
S edge-atoms in MoS2, can strengthen the interaction between
H and defect. However, for the metal vacancy (VPd and VPt) in PdSe2, PtSe2, PdTe2, and PtTe2, the interaction is too strong to favor the
HER based on Sabatier principle. For the VSe and DVSe in PdSe2, the weak localized states with lower
PDOS is found to be formed, as shown in Figure 4b,c. With the participation of localized
states, the H is adsorbed on Pb atom near the vacancy results in the
appropriate interaction between H and defects (Figures S1 and S3). In Figure 5b,c, it is observed that there is a little charge accumulation
near the vacancy. For BSe, the weak localized states from
the contribution of Pd near B atom (Figure 4d) induce the accumulation of charges near
the B atom (Figure 5d). With the H-adsorption, the localized state is modulated obviously
with the charge transfer in Figure S3d.
In addition, it is noticed there is a trend of charge transfer from
defects to H with charge polarization in the three cases, VSe, DVSe, and BSe (Figure S1b–d). This is different from the mechanism of H-adsorption
on pristine basal plane where the electron charge is transferred from
H to adsorption site and its nearby sites, as shown in Figure S5.

3.3 HER Activity
on Defective Structures
The relative Gibbs free energy (ΔGH*) of H-adsorption
state H* with
the gas phase as a reference state is an important indicator to assess
the catalytic activity of catalysts. Here, we adopt ΔGH* to access
the HER activity of the four materials with different defect types.
As the value of ΔGH* approaches zero, the HER activity will become the
best. First, we analyze the reaction activity of pristine basal plane.
For PdSe2, PtSe2, PdTe2, and PtTe2, the values of ΔGH* are
0.94, 1.38, 1.10, and 1.44 eV, respectively. These large positive
values imply that the HER activity of these pristine basal planes
are not good. Therefore, the favorable HER activity in experiments
of similar materials, such as MoS2, is usually attributed
to the contribution of edge states from the edges of 2D materials.

The calculated ΔGH* values of various materials considered
with various defects are shown in Figure 6a. Compared with the pristine basal plane,
these point defects can decrease significantly the Gibbs free energy
of H-adsorption and thus greatly improve the catalytic activity, except
the VPd and VPt in PdSe2 and PtSe2. The calculated ΔGH* of Pd (Pt) vacancy in PdSe2 and PtSe2 is very negative and indicates the interaction
between H and substrate materials is too strong to release H2 effectively. Compared to T′-MoS2, the ΔGH* value of
Se (Te) vacancy in the case of PdSe2 and PdTe2 is a little large. The large positive value of ΔGH* implies that the
weak binding of H with the catalyst will impede the Volmer adsorption
process. For the rest of defect models in the considered four materials,
especially for the B-doping, the calculated ΔGH* values are close
to the thermoneutral, suggesting the superior HER catalytic activity.

Figure 6 (a) Values
of ΔGH* and (b) volcano curve between the
exchange current density i0 and ΔGH* for monolayer
PdSe2, PtSe2, PdTe2, and PtTe2 with various defects.

To further directly compare the HER catalytic activity of
different
defect models in the four materials, the theoretical exchange current
density (i0) is calculated on the basis
of ΔGH*. The results are plotted in Figure 6b. The catalytic activity of the catalyst
is reflected in the volcano curve. We can find that the double vacancy
DVSe (DVTe) and B-substitution are located at
the top of volcano curve and show a much higher current density. The i0 of BSe in PdSe2 and
DVTe in PtTe2 are even higher than those of
Pt catalyst because of the small value of ΔGH*. The results of the
above analysis of the formation of defects indicate that the B-doping
can improve HER activity effectively. A comparison of the overall
catalytic properties of these four materials reveals that PtTe2 exhibits a slightly more superior activity than other materials.

Defect concentration may have an important effect on the HER activity,
whereas a higher defect concentration means more active sites on the
basal plane. To take PdSe2 as an example, we explore the
concentration effect of defects. The ΔGH* values of PdSe2 with various defects including VSe, DVSe,
and BSe was calculated as the functions of defect concentration
in Figure 7a. At the
low concentration less than 8%, the defect concentration does not
have significant effect on the Gibbs free energy for the single vacancy
VSe and double vacancy DVSe. With the increase
in concentration to more than 12%, the H-adsorption strength of VSe has a trend of decrease and that of DVSe has
a trend of increase. For the B-doping, the value of ΔGH* has a decreasing
trend, following the increase in B concentration. The volcano curve
between exchange current density and Gibbs free energy is plotted
in Figure 7b. The B-doping
is located at the top of the volcano curve, which implies a moderate
H-adsorption and a superior activity, especially at low concentration
less than 6%. For the concentration less than 8%, the double vacancy
DVSe also has a superior activity and resides near the
top site. Taking PdSe2 as an example, we also check the
effect of vacancy size under the condition of rich vacancies. As shown
in Figure S6, with the increase in vacancy
size up to quadruple vacancy, the value of ΔGH* has a decreasing
trend.

PdSe2. (b) Volcano curve between the exchange current density i0 and ΔGH* for defective PdSe2 with

4 Conclusions
We have studied the formation
of defects and the modulation of
electronic properties of the monolayer PdSe2, PtSe2, PdTe2, and PtTe2 by first-principle
calculations. It was found that single vacancy VSe (VTe) was easier to form in Se (Te)-rich condition. In addition,
B can be doped effectively into the lattice of the four compounds
by the formation of BSe (BTe). We demonstrated
that the catalytic activity of inert basal plane in PdSe2, PtSe2, PdTe2, and PtTe2 could
be triggered efficiently through the single vacancy, double vacancy,
and B-doping. This indicates that defect engineering could be used
to enhance the HER activity of these compounds. The improvement in
catalytic activity is found to originate from the facts that the defects
can introduce quasi-localized states in the band gap and that these
electronic states can interact moderately with H atom. With an overall
assessment of the HER activity in terms of ΔGH* value, the activity
of tellurides is found to be superior to the selenides slightly among
PdSe2, PtSe2, PdTe2, and PtTe2. Moreover, B-doping is a much more effective method to enhance
the HER activity in these compounds. In short, it is a feasible strategy
to activate the HER activity of platinum and palladium dichalcogenides
by introducing the intrinsic defect and B-doping. It is also expected
that these results may shed some light on improving the HER activity
of other TMDs.
