A cost-effective,
scalable, and environmentally benign process
is herein reported for the synthesis of pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate:
5-(difluromethoxy)-2-[{(3,4-dimethoxy-2-pyridinyl)methyl}sulfinyl]-1H-benzimidazole sodium sesquihydrate. At least two of the
three main synthetic steps (coupling and oxidation) have been carried
out for the first time in water, with no need to isolate and purify
the intermediates, affording the corresponding pantoprazole sodium
in good yield and purity. Minimum organic solvents, in terms of both
the number of solvents and the volume of solvent used, are employed
to make this process both economical and environment friendly. Furthermore,
in situ transformation of pantoprazole sodium heterosolvate, due to
the association between molecules of water and solvent used, to pantoprazole
sodium sesquihydrate is described.

1 Introduction
Pantoprazole1 is the active ingredient
of a pharmaceutical product that is marketed as sodium salt in the
United States by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Inc. and sold under the brand
name Protonix. Pantoprazole is chemically known as 5-(difluromethoxy)-2-[{(3,4-dimethoxy-2-pyridinyl)methyl}sulfinyl]-1H-benzimidazole.2,3 It is a proton pump
inhibitor used to treat ulcers, gastroesophageal reflux disorder,
erosive esophagitis, and Zollinger–Ellison syndrome.1,4 Pantoprazole sodium (1) was disclosed for the first
time in European patent application EP0166287.2 The process comprised the condensation of 5-difluromethoxy-2-mercaptobenzimidazole
(2) with 2-chloromethyl-3,4-dimethoxypyridinium hydrochloride
(3) to get the sulfide intermediate (4),
which is oxidized with m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid
(MCPBA) in dichloromethane, yielding pantoprazole. The main disadvantages
are the formation of sulfone impurity (6), which is difficult
to remove, use of costly reagent (MCPBA), and the generation of m-chlorobenzoic acid as a byproduct during the reaction,
which affects the purity of the product. Several other oxidizing agents,
namely, tert-BuOCl,5tert-butylhydroperoxide,6,7 oxone,7 H2O2,8,9 Na2CO3·1.5H2O2,10 NaBO3·4H2O,11 CH3CO3H,12,13N-chlorosuccinimide,14 and ϵ-phthalimidoperhexanoic acid15 are well reported for the preparation of pantoprazole from its corresponding
sulfide intermediate by oxidation. However, the major drawbacks of
these methods are the formation of oxidative impurities,5−9,15 high cost,7 difficulty in scale-up,7−9,12 longer reaction time (1–2 days),9 and low yields,5,16 as well as use of expensive transition-metal
catalysts, such as sodium tungstate,8 ammonium
molybdate,9,10 and VO(acac)2.6

A key step in the synthesis of this largest-selling
drug is the
oxidation of sulfide (4) to the corresponding sulfoxide
(5). A critical issue is to avoid unwanted further oxidation
(overoxidation) of the sulfoxide (5) to the corresponding
sulfone derivative (6) and the formation of pantoprazole N-oxide (7). Due to the structural similarity
of sulfoxide and sulfone, the removal of the sulfone impurity is very
difficult, and even the application of high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) at an industrial scale has been mentioned,18 which is an expensive procedure. Different approaches, as well as their combinations, have been described
to prevent overoxidation of 5: application of different,
sometimes for industrial use, and even somewhat extraordinary oxidizing
agents,19,20 working with diluted oxidizing agents,21 working at low, sometimes even extremely low,
temperatures,1,19 optimization of molar ratio of
the sulfide oxidizing agent,20 and use
of mild oxidizing agents, such as magnesium monoperoxyphthalate.22 All of these oxidation process modifications
are indirect in their approach and mostly result in complicated isolated
procedures and reaction conditions that are noncompetitive at industrial
scale. Attempts to scale up some of the laboratory procedures reported
in the literature showed very poor reproducibility and scalability.
Therefore, the prior art teaches that the reaction can only be controlled
by taking extreme care to find the precise reaction conditions and
by repeating the process many times to validate the ideal conditions.
This makes the reaction extremely inflexible in terms of transferring
the process to new facilities or scaling up the production capacity
by moving the process to larger reactors.

Sodium hypochlorite
(NaOCl) has attracted much interest in the
synthesis17,23−26 of pantoprazole owing to its
potential to control the sulfone impurity.27 Sodium hypochlorite is a commercially available, nonhazardous, and
inexpensive reagent, which is easy and safe to handle, and its use
in an industrial scale requires neither specific reactors nor safety
devices and procedures. Besides, NaOCl and its byproduct are less
polluting and allow to easily recover the resulting pantoprazole in
highly pure form, without the need for cumbersome and costly purification
processes. Furthermore, it has been found that the use of NaOCl as
an oxidizing agent allows to predict and control the kinetics of the
oxidation reaction, thereby avoiding the formation of byproducts with
different oxidation degrees, such as N-oxides and/or
sulfonyl (−SO2−) derivatives28 and/or dangerous accumulations of oxidizer. In contrast,
such accumulations take place with other known oxidizing agents, for
example, with peracetic acid,12,13 H2O2,8,9 or acetic acid aqueous solution, which contains
about 15% of active oxygen. Therefore, the oxidation reaction can
be easily carried out by using NaOCl on a large scale without particular
hazards. Bajic et al.17 reported the use
of 16.9% sodium hypochlorite solution (active chlorine assay) for
oxidation; however, the commercial availability of higher assay NaOCl
is limited, which makes the process less attractive. They have also
reported process improvement to avoid overoxidation impurities, which
involves controlling the molar ratio of oxidizing agent versus sulfide
intermediate by providing an initial inadequate amount of oxidizing
agent into the process and adding further appropriate amount(s) of
oxidizing agent sufficient to substantially complete the reaction
but inefficient to produce any overoxidation impurities. However,
such techniques are tedious and cumbersome from commercial point of
view.

In the present work, we have found that by the use of
sodium hypochlorite,
the oxidation of 4 to 5 is readily achievable,
giving a reproducible and easily scalable process having sulfone impurity
and sulfide below quantification limits by HPLC. The concentration
of sulfide impurity is not critical for the final quality of the product
because it can be efficiently removed as it has no inclination toward
sodium salt formation.13 The present process
produces the pantoprazole containing not more than 0.2% (w/w by HPLC)
of total impurities.

Compared to the reported procedures, our
main aims were to develop
a green, cost-effective, scalable, and economic process to conduct
the mass production of pantoprazole in a more concentrated fashion
to increase throughput and minimize cost and waste. Although we are
mindful of the diversity of methods available for the oxidation of
sulfide to date,5−15 in the present work, we have explored the conditions for the industrial
synthesis of pantoprazole taking into account all of the aforesaid
literature reports and reported, for the first time, the alkylation
and oxidation reactions in aqueous reaction media, the key steps involved
in the synthesis of pantoprazole (Scheme 1). A comparison of the results of present
reagent system (NaOCl/NaOH/H2O) with the literature precedents
of some recently published oxidative systems5,7−10,12−16,23,25 for the conversion of 4 to 5 in the synthesis
of pantoprazole is reported in Table 1, which clearly indicates the advantages of the present
system over existing methods.

(5 vol); temp (0–5 °C); time (3 h).

2 Results and Discussion
Herein, we described an improved, one-pot approach for the synthesis
of 1 with high-quality API product as per the standards
of European Pharmacopoeia.29 The present
process involves the coupling of the key starting materials 2 and 3 in water using NaOH to yield pantoprazole
sulfide (4) as a solid in the reaction mass. The obtained
sulfide (4) is then subjected to oxidation in water using
NaOCl as an oxidizing agent under organic-solvent-free conditions.
The oxidant is added slowly to the alkaline aqueous solution of 4 over a period of 2–3 h at a temperature of 0–5
°C. After completion of reaction by HPLC, the residual hypochlorite
was quenched using 5% Na2S2O5 solution,
and the pH was adjusted between 7.5 and 8.0 to yield the corresponding
pantoprazole free base (5), which was isolated as a red-brown
residue by extraction of aqueous layer using DCM. The residue obtained
after removal of solvent was then treated with ∼46% w/w aqueous
solution of NaOH in acetonitrile to afford the final API that meets
all aspects as per the European Pharmacopoeia.

It is possible
for the pantoprazole sulfide (4) to
be isolated and dried before subjected to oxidation; however, this
is not preferred, as it is possible to improve the yield and purity
of the pantoprazole sodium by carrying forward the wet cake of pantoprazole
sulfide in situ for the oxidation step by treating it with the hypohalite
solution in water. Reported industrial processes5,14 involved
the isolation of 4 in the form of a dried solid. Nevertheless,
it is a low-melting compound, and a large amount of time is consumed
for its drying to proceed to the next stage. Herein, the intermediates 4 and 5, as shown in Scheme 1, were not isolated during the process. In
particular, they were not subjected to any purification.

Optimization of Ideal Reaction Conditions
Concomitant
tests were carried out for the screening of best reaction conditions
for the synthesis of 1. The main parameters of the reaction
have been studied and determined as discussed herein.

2.1 Coupling of 2 and 3
The first
step is the modest coupling of 2 and 3,
in which equimolar amounts of 2 and 3 react
in aqueous medium in the presence of NaOH
to form 4 under organic-solvent-free conditions. The
syntheses of 4 have been accomplished by various researchers;
however, the drawbacks associated are reaction at high temperature
(60–65 °C),30 use of organic
solvent14 (isopropyl alcohol), and tedious
and cumbersome workup procedures.5 As per
the chemistry involved, 2 M equiv of NaOH will be required to effect
the coupling. However, the volume of water plays an important role
in the quality and yield of 4. Figure 1 describes that yield and quality of product
are strongly dependent on the volume of water used. The yield of the
product reduced to 94.18% with purity 98.81% when 5 vol water was
used (Table 2, entry
1). However, if we increase the water volumes, the yield and purity
profile of 4 gets increased. On the other hand, when
the volume of water is less, the reaction mass increased viscosity,
causing difficulty in stirring the solution. Therefore, it has been
found that the optimum yield (99.80%) and the desired HPLC purity
(99.91%) of 4 are obtained when 10 vol of water are used
in the reaction of 2 and 3 in the presence
of 2 mol equiv of NaOH in a reaction time of 3 h at 25–30 °C
(Table 2, entry 4).
The obtained 4 has been carried forward to the next stage
as wet solid without drying.

2.2 Oxidation of 4 to 5
With the optimized synthesis of 4 in hand,
we next explore the ideal reaction conditions of oxidation of 4 to 5. A detailed discussion of the main parameters
is given below.

2.2.1 Effect of Solvent
Solvents ethyl
acetate, acetonitrile, acetone, and DCM were tried to study the reaction
rate of oxidation of 4 to 5 using NaOCl
as an oxidant. Table 3 indicates that the HPLC conversion of 4 to 5 is good using ethyl acetate, acetonitrile, and DCM. However, using
ethyl acetate and DCM, biphasic reaction mass was obtained, which
leads to difficulty in the monitoring of reaction as 4 is soluble in organic solvent and 5 being sodium salt
in the reaction mixture will remain soluble in aqueous phase. Acetone
leads to poor conversion by exploiting the same reaction conditions.
However, in case of acetonitrile, homogeneous reaction mass was obtained
throughout the reaction with 96.58% conversion by HPLC. Later, surprising
to our results, almost same reaction profile was obtained when the
reaction was carried out in neat water (Table 3, entry 5). The only difference between using
water and organic solvents arises in the impurity profile of 5, wherein content of pantoprazole dimer impurity (8) (Scheme 2) was slightly
high (0.45%) compared to that obtained in rest of the solvents (Table 3).

2.2.2 Effect of Mole Equivalents
of NaOCl
It is quite obvious from Table 4 that the quality of product is strongly
dependent
on the mole equivalents of NaOCl. It has been observed that the optimum
conversion (98.29% by HPLC, Table 4, entry 3) and the desired purity profile were obtained
when 1.05 equiv of NaOCl was utilized. The reaction conversion decreased
to 97.78 and 96.52% with an increased content of 4 (0.08
and 0.49%, entries 1 and 2), if we decrease the mole equivalent of
NaOCl to 1.0 and 0.95, respectively. On the other hand, if we increase
the mole equivalent of NaOCl from 1.05 to 1.1 and 1.2, the conversion
of 4 to 5 decreases comparatively with an
increased sulfone content (0.07 and 0.10%, respectively, entries 4
and 5).

2.2.3 Effect of Temperature
After optimization
of mole equivalents of NaOCl, we explored the effect of temperature
on the oxidation reaction. The temperature of reaction proved to be
a very important factor in controlling the content of sulfone impurity
(6). It was found that the oxidation of 4 to 5 carried out at temperatures of 0–5 °C
produces high-quality compound (Table 5). The content of 6 was found to be increasing
with the increase in temperature (Table 5, entries 2 and 3). The chances of formation
of 6 also minimize at low temperature (−5 to 0
°C); however, the reaction conversion was slightly slow.

All
of the above optimized parameters in combination produced excellent
results. The wide range of studies carried out in this direction has
thrown light on the fact that using NaOCl as an oxidizing agent, the
formation of sulfone impurity 6 is negligible. We found
that there is no criticality of pH range and solvent except temperature
of the reaction in the formation of 6, as is claimed
by various researchers.13,17 Meanwhile, isolation
of the compound by pH adjustment in water alone proved problematic.
The nature of the solid obtained after pH adjustment was found to
be gummy; therefore, a suitable solvent for the isolation of 5 from aqueous layer was required. From the economic point of view and the solubility of 5, the best possible solvent was DCM. Thus, extraction of the aqueous
layer using DCM followed by its removal gives the sulfoxide (5) free from the contamination of parent sulfide (4) and sulfone impurity (6).

2.3 Formation of Sodium Salt of 5
Next, we
explore the formation of sodium salt of pantoprazole
free base (5) using NaOH in a suitable solvent. Solvents
acetonitrile, DCM, ethyl acetate, and acetone were tried (Figure 2). Table 6 concludes that quality (99.92%
HPLC purity, Figure 3) and other parameters as per international standards29 and the optimal yield (85%) of 1 were accomplished using acetonitrile as solvent. DCM leads to off-white
product with an increased content of dimer impurity (8). However, using ethyl acetate, yield was low and the product fails
with respect to description.

2.3.1 Acetone–Water Solvate of Pantoprazole
Sodium
An almost white powder with good yield (82%) was obtained
using acetone as solvent; however, the product fails with respect
to assay by potentiometry (90.43% w/w), which is not adequate as per
the international standards. The residual solvent analyses of the
product by GC revealed that acetone has been trapped in the molecule
up to 90 172 ppm even after drying at 45 °C up to 15 h.
These observations led to the conclusion that both water molecules
and acetone molecules get involved in the formation of crystal lattice,
which in turn resulted in the formation of a pantoprazole sodium heterosolvate31 (acetone–water solvate of pantoprazole
sodium), which was further supported by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) techniques. The
acetone content in the product was found to be 20.37% from 1H NMR spectrum, which shows a singlet at 2.083 ppm (δ value),
which is further supported by signals at 30.71 ppm (−CH3) and 206.58 ppm (−CO) in the 13C NMR spectrum.
The PXRD patterns of pantoprazole heterosolvate and pantoprazole sesquihydrate
are shown in Figure 4, which clearly illustrates that both sesquihydrate and heterosolvate
exhibit distinct peaks. The TG thermograms of heterosolvate and sesquihydrate
shown in Figure 5 disclosed
that the weight loss of sesquihydrate was 6.19%, which is consistent
with both the theoretical water content (6.67%; lit.29 between 5.9 and 6.9%) and water content (6.56%, Table 6), as determined by
KF titrator. However, heterosolvate shows two weight-loss steps, corresponding
to release of solvent twice. The weight loss is 12.49% in the first
step and 2.79% in the second step. It can be inferred that the first-step
weight loss corresponds to the removal of one water molecule and one
acetone molecule, whereas the second-step weight loss corresponds
to the removal of another water molecule. Figure 6 depicts the DSC thermograms of heterosolvate
and sesquihydrate of pantoprazole. Only one endothermal peak was observed
when water is removed in case of sesquihydrate, whereas heterosolvate
shows two endothermic peaks, the first one being of removal of acetone
molecules. Because acetone molecules with low boiling points form
channels and connect with water molecules by hydrogen bonding (between
O-atom of carbonyl group of acetone and H-atom of water) in the lattice,
the desolvation begins at low temperature and water molecules are
removed together with acetone molecules. Another water molecule is
removed subsequently, which is the same with monohydrate. To date,
no reports have been found regarding the conversion of heterosolvate
to sesquihydrate utilizing DCM as solvent, a well-known drawback encountered
in various reports32a−32c employing acetone for the formation of sodium
salt. After studying all of these parameters, it has been observed
that using acetone as solvent for salt formation of 5 leads to the formation of pantoprazole sodium heterosolvate. Meanwhile,
we tried to remove acetone from wet solid of 1 after
its isolation by filtration of reaction mass. After several investigations,
we discovered that next to the preparation of sodium salt of 5 in acetone as solvent, the wet solid obtained after filtration
of reaction mass shall not be subjected to drying. Instead, the wet
solid was given DCM slurry in a reactor to remove the traces of acetone.
This technique works well, and the solid obtained after filtration
of DCM slurry was pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate (1). To confirm the transformation, the PXRD data were recorded, which
proved that the heterosolvate has been converted to sesquihydrate.

3 Conclusions
The present process has a number of advantages compared to those
of the known ones, for example, inexpensive and commercially available
reagents (NaOH/NaOCl/H2O) and most of the reaction steps
were carried out in water. High product purity with good yield was
achieved by controlling the impurities after optimizing the main parameters.
This makes the synthesis economical and scalable, thus rendering this
process highly amenable to the synthesis of this important and largely
consumed generic pharmaceutical. The problem of heterosolvate was
successfully resolved by exploiting the DCM washing to the wet solid.

4 Experimental Sections
4.1 Reagents and Analytics
All of the
starting materials used in the process were purchased from commercial
suppliers with optimum purity and used without further purification.
The reagents and solvents were supplied by manufactures. NMR spectra
were recorded on Bruker 400 MHz spectrometers with TMS as the internal
standard. Chemical shifts are expressed in parts per million (δ,
ppm). MS were recorded on Velos Pro from Thermo Scientific LC-Mass
spectrometer. The IR spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu IR Affinity-I
FT-IR spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Corporation, North America) over
the range of 4000–400 cm–1 by pressed pellet
method using KBr. HPLC analyses were conducted using Waters 2695 with
UV detector, hypersil ODS column (125 mm × 4.0 mm, 5 μm),
solvent system of acetonitrile and NaOH sol. (40 mg/L) in the ratio
1:1 (% v/v), wavelengths of 290 and 305 nm, flow rate of 1.0 mL/min,
and run time of 55 min. PXRD spectra were recorded on PANalytical,
model: Empyrean. Melting points were determined on Buchi B-542 apparatus
by an open capillary method and are uncorrected. TGA curves were recorded
on Mettler Toledo, model: TGA, software: STARe system,
method: 30–300 °C @10 °C/min. DSC were recorded on
Mettler Toledo, model: DSC, software: STARe system, method:
30–250 °C @10 °C. Purified water by Milli-Q system
(Millipore) was used for the preparation of samples, reference solutions,
and mobile phases. Isolated yields refer to yields corrected for purity
on the basis of HPLC assay using standards. The spectroscopic analysis
data of API are well correlated with reported specifics.3

4.2 General Experimental Procedure
for the Synthesis
of Pantoprazole Sodium Sesquihydrate (1)
A 3
L four-necked round-bottom flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer,
a reflux condenser, a thermometer, and a pressure-equalizing funnel
was charged with 5-difluromethoxy-2-mercaptobenzimidazole (2) (0.4625 mol, 100 g) in a mixture of water (1000 mL) and NaOH (0.925
mol, 37 g) under stirring. The reaction mass was stirred at 25–30
°C, and an aqueous solution of 2-chloromethyl-3,4-dimethoxypyridinium
hydrochloride (3) (0.4625, 103.64 g in 200 mL of water)
was added dropwise over a period of 2–3 h. The stirring was
continued for an additional 1 h at 25–30 °C. When the
reaction was considered complete as determined by HPLC analysis, the
precipitated solids were filtered under reduced pressure and washed
with water, thus yielding the wet cake (466 g) of pantoprazole sulfide
(4). The wet cake of pantoprazole sulfide (4) was charged into an aqueous solution of NaOH (0.6937 mol, 27.75
g dissolved in 500 mL of water) at 25–30 °C. The reaction
mass was cooled to 0–5 °C, and an aqueous solution of
9% NaOCl (401.68 g) was added dropwise over a period of 2–3
h and then stirred for 1 h. Progress of the reaction was monitored
by HPLC. After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was
quenched with a 5% Na2S2O5 solution
(350 mL). DCM (500 mL) and water (400 mL) were charged into the reaction,
and the pH of the reaction mass was adjusted between 7.5 and 8.0 using
2N-HCl solution. Layers were separated, and the aqueous layer was
extracted with DCM (200 mL). The combined DCM layers were distilled
off under vacuum at 30–35 °C to obtain a red-brown residue
of pantoprazole free base (5). The residue was dissolved
in acetonitrile (500 mL) and cooled to 20–25 °C. Aqueous
solution of NaOH (18.50 g dissolved in 20 mL of water) was added dropwise,
followed by addition of a seed crystal of pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate.
The contents were stirred for 2 h at 20–25 °C and then
cooled to 0–5 °C for 3 h. The reaction mass was filtered,
washed with chilled acetonitrile (50 mL), and the obtained solid was
dried under vacuum at 35−40 °C; 170 g (85% yield and 99.92%
w/w HPLC purity) of almost white powder of 1 having water
