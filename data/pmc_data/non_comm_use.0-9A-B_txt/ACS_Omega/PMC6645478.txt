Sepiolite nanoclay needles have been
selectively localized either in the natural rubber (NR) phase or in
the carboxylated nitrile rubber (XNBR) phase of the XNBR/NR (50/50)
blend prepared by the solution casting method. In a systematic manner,
the role of the difference value between the interaction parameter
of individual blend components (NR or XNBR)/solvent and the interaction
parameter of sepiolite nanoclay/solvent in selectively localizing
the sepiolite nanoclay to the NR phase or the XNBR phase of the XNBR/NR
(50/50) blend has been explored. A higher percentage of sepiolite
nanoclay resides in the dispersed NR phase when the difference value
between the interaction parameter of NR/solvent and the interaction
parameter of sepiolite nanoclay/solvent is lower than the difference
value between the interaction parameter of XNBR/solvent and the interaction
parameter of sepiolite nanoclay/solvent. On the other hand, a higher
percentage of sepiolite nanoclay resides in the continuous XNBR phase
when the difference value between the interaction parameter of XNBR/solvent
and the interaction parameter of sepiolite nanoclay/solvent is lower
than the difference value between the interaction parameter of NR/solvent
and the interaction parameter of sepiolite nanoclay/solvent. It has
been shown that by judiciously choosing different solvent combinations
to prepare the blend and to disperse nanoclay, it is possible to fine-tune
the difference value between the interaction parameter of individual
blend components (NR or XNBR)/solvent and the interaction parameter
of sepiolite nanoclay/solvent and dictate the selective localization
of sepiolite nanoclay to the NR phase or the XNBR phase of XNBR/NR
(50/50) blend. This study shows that it is possible to generate a
rubber blend with controlled properties by selectively localizing
needlelike sepiolite nanoclay in the dispersed phase or the continuous
phase of the rubber blend prepared by the solution casting method.

1 Introduction
Distribution
of fillers in polymer blends is important in controlling the physical
properties of the final products.1 In a
matrix of incompatible polymer blends, an added filler distributes
itself unevenly to each component of the polymer blend.2 The distribution of filler particles between
the two phases of a polymer blend is affected by a number of factors,
such as molecular weight, polarity, unsaturation, viscosity, and so
on, of the individual polymers of the polymer blend.3 In general, these filler particles distribute randomly
within the incompatible polymer blends, that is, either preferentially
accumulate in either of the blend phases or at the blend interface,
depending on thermodynamic driving forces and several kinetic factors.4,5 In the literature, many researchers have investigated the effect
of heterogeneous distribution of fillers in polymer blends.1,6,7

Over the past few years,
incorporation of nanoparticles into polymer blends has also attracted
considerable attention because nanoparticles can act as compatibilizers
for immiscible polymer blends, control the morphology of polymer blends,
change the phase separation temperature, and so on.8 However, like conventional reinforcing fillers, nanofillers
also randomly localize either in the blend phases or at the blend
interface and lead to several undesirable properties.4,5,9 Elias et al. have studied the
effect of hydrophilic and hydrophobic silica nanoparticles on the
morphology and the rheological properties of immiscible polypropylene
(PP)/polystyrene (PS) blends.10 Morphological
studies show that the hydrophilic silica tends to confine in the PS
phase because of the better interaction between hydrophilic silica
and PS.10 On the other hand, hydrophobic
silica tends to locate in the PP phase and at the PP/PS interface.10 It has been shown that the stabilization mechanism
of the PP/PS blend by hydrophilic silica is because of the reduction
in the interfacial tension whereas hydrophobic silica acts as a rigid
layer preventing the coalescence of PS droplets.10 Essawy and El-Nashar have investigated the use of montmorillonite
(MMT) nanoclay as a reinforcing and compatibilizing filler for the
acrylonitrile butadiene rubber/styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) rubber
blend.11 It has been shown that the MMT
nanoclay has moderate compatibility with both the blend components,
and the nanoclay particles are located at the interface of the blend
which induces compatibilization between the blend components.11

Hong et al. have investigated the effect
of organically modified nanoclay in immiscible polybutylene terephthalate
(PBT)/polyethylene (PE) blend.12 It has
been shown that the nanoclay particles selectively localize in the
dispersed PBT phase because of their affinity with PBT.12 This results in effective size reduction and
narrowed size distribution of the dispersed phase, which significantly
increases the storage modulus of the blend.12 Ray and Bousmina have investigated the effect of organic modification
of MMT nanoclays on the compatibilization efficiency in the immiscible
polycarbonate (PC)/polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) blend.13 It has been found that the nanoclay particles
are well dispersed both in the continuous PMMA phase and in the dispersed
PC phase.13 The results show that the increase
in the order of d-spacing (average basal spacing
or gallery gap observed in layered MMT-based nanoclays) of MMT nanoclays
correlates well with the order of particle size reduction of the dispersed
phase, which dramatically improves the thermal stability of the PC/PMMA
blend.13

Bandyopadhyay et al. have
studied the distribution of MMT-based nanoclay particles (Cloisite
30B and Cloisite Na+) and its influence on the mechanical
properties of nonpolar natural rubber (NR)/polar epoxidized NR (ENR)
and nonpolar NR/nonpolar polybutadiene (BR) blends.14 It has been shown that both Cloisite 30B and Cloisite Na+ nanoclay particles preferentially migrate toward the ENR
phase rather than the NR phase in the 50NR/50ENR blend because of
the low viscosity of the ENR phase in comparison to the viscosity
of the NR phase.14 The migration of a very
high amount of the Cloisite Na+ nanoclay particles toward
the ENR phase is because of the interaction between the polar Cloisite
Na+ and the pendant epoxy groups present in the ENR phase.14 Furthermore, it has been shown that both Cloisite
30B and Cloisite Na+ nanoclay particles preferentially
migrate toward the NR phase rather than the BR phase in the 50NR/50BR
blend because of the low viscosity of the NR phase in comparison to
the viscosity of the BR phase.14

Cao et al. have investigated the effect of graphene oxide (GO) in
polyamide-12 (PA-12)/polyphenylene oxide (PPO) blend with special
reference to the compatibilization of blend components.15 It has been reported that GO is homogeneously
distributed throughout the PA-12/PPO blend. It has also been shown
that the amphiphilic GO sheets exhibit strong interactions with PA-12
and PPO, which in turn minimizes their interfacial tension, thus leading
to notable improvement in mechanical and thermal properties.15 Chen et al. have studied the effect of modified
pristine multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) in high-density PE/polyamide
6 blend.16 The modified MWCNTs are preferentially
found at the interface of the immiscible polymer blend.16 The MWCNTs at the interface facilitate the chain
segments diffusion across the interface, which prevents the propagation
of cracks along the interface.16 Liu et
al. have studied the design of high-performance poly-l-lactide
(PLLA)/poly-d-lactide grafted ethylene-acrylic ester copolymer
(EGD)/MWCNTs blends through anchoring MWCNTs at the interface with
the aid of stereocomplex crystallization.9 The anchored MWCNTs function as effective interfacial enhancers
to significantly increase the toughness and interfacial strength of
PLLA/EGD blends. The anchored MWCNTs also facilitate the formation
of an electrical conductive pathway in the network-like PLLA/EGD blends
at a much lower percolation threshold.9 Liu et al. have studied the effect of nanosilica particles on the
shape relaxation of dispersed PS droplets in the PP/PS blend.17 The shape relaxation process of PS droplets
from highly elongated fiber toward spheres has been observed in both
filled and unfilled systems using an optical microscope.17 The selective localization of nanosilica on
the dispersed PS droplet retards the relaxation process of the deformed
PS droplets particularly when nanosilica particles form the network
in the dispersed phase.17 Pawar and Bose
have studied the effect of the shape of nanoparticles in preserving
the peculiar morphologies in various binary polymer blends.18 It has been shown that the presence of nanoparticles
in the filled phase slows down the relaxation of the filled phase.18 This helps to preserve the peculiar morphology
without altering the interfacial tension between the phases.18 Zhao et al. have studied the strain relaxation
behavior of the dispersed PP droplets in the PP/PS blends in the presence
of styrene–ethylene/butylene–styrene (SEBS) triblock
copolymer as a compatibilizer.19 It has
been found that the SEBS significantly retards the stress relaxation
of the dispersed PP phase by increasing the interfacial adhesion between
the blend components.19

From a detailed
literature review, it is evident that there are few reports in the
literature which discuss the methodology to selectively localize nanoparticles
in the dispersed phase or continuous phase of rubber blend prepared
by the melt mixing method. However, many efforts have not been directed
toward understanding the methodologies for selectively localizing
nanofillers in the dispersed phase or in the continuous phase of rubber
blend generated by dissolving the blend in a solvent and dispersing
nanoclay in a solvent (solvent casting method). In our recent publication,
a simple and unique thermodynamic approach has been used to preferentially
fix layered MMT-based nanoclay particles in a particular phase of
incompatible NR and carboxylated nitrile rubber (XNBR) blend prepared
by the solvent casting method.20 It has
been shown that by judiciously choosing different solvents for dissolving
the rubbers and for dispersing nanoclays, it is possible to preferentially
move the MMT nanoclay particles to different phases of the XNBR/NR
(50/50) blend.20 A similar approach needs
to be undertaken to validate this thermodynamic approach for preferentially
fixing different nanoclay particles (having different structures)
in the phases of rubber blends. In this work, the same thermodynamic
approach has been used to selectively localize individual sepiolite
nanoclay needles either in the NR phase or in the XNBR phase of the
incompatible XNBR/NR (50/50) blend prepared by the solvent casting
method. It has been shown that the difference value between the interaction
parameter of the individual blend components (either XNBR or NR)/solvent
and the interaction parameter of sepiolite nanoclay/solvent dictates
the localization of sepiolite nanoclay needles either in the NR phase
or in the XNBR phase. The abovementioned difference value has been
judiciously manipulated by choosing different solvent combinations
to prepare the XNBR/NR blend and to disperse sepiolite nanoclay, which
consequently gives scope to selectively localize sepiolite nanoclay
needles either in the NR phase or in the XNBR phase of the XNBR/NR
(50/50) blend.

2.1.1 Calculation
of the Difference Value between the Interaction Parameter of Rubber
(Either XNBR or NR)/Toluene and the Interaction Parameter of Sepiolite
Nanoclay/Toluene
The difference value between the interaction
parameter of NR–toluene and the interaction parameter of sepiolite
nanoclay–toluene has been calculated from the equation below
and the values are reported in Table 1. 1  where χAB is the interaction
parameter of NR–toluene and χCD is the interaction
parameter of sepiolite nanoclay–toluene. The χAB (0.056) and χCD (0.104) values have been calculated
from Hildebrand equation.20−22 The solubility parameter values of NR, XNBR, sepiolite nanoclay,
and toluene are obtained from the standard literature.20−22

3	NR/chloroform–sepiolite nanoclay/MEK	 	 	0.12	 	
4	XNBR/chloroform–sepiolite nanoclay/MEK	 	 	 	0.00	
The difference value between
the interaction parameter of XNBR–toluene and the interaction
parameter of sepiolite nanoclay–toluene has been calculated
from the equation below, and the values are reported in Table 1. 2  where
χXY is the interaction parameter between XNBR–toluene.
The χXY (0.179) value has been calculated from the
Hildebrand equation.20−22

The lower interaction parameter value of NR–toluene (χAB) when compared to the interaction parameter value of XNBR–toluene
(χXY) confirms the good compatibility between NR
and toluene in comparison to the compatibility between XNBR and toluene.
Because the difference value between the interaction parameter of
NR–toluene and the interaction parameter of sepiolite nanoclay–toluene
is lesser than the difference value between the interaction parameter
of XNBR–toluene and the interaction parameter of sepiolite
nanoclay–toluene, it is predicted that the higher concentration
of sepiolite nanoclay should selectively localize in the NR phase
when compared to the XNBR phase of the XNBR/NR (50/50) blend. The
above prediction regarding the selective localization of a higher
percentage of sepiolite nanoclay in the NR phase of the XNBR/NR (50/50)
blend has been validated in the forthcoming sections.

2.1.2 Morphological Analysis by
Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM),
and X-ray Diffraction (XRD)
The TEM micrograph of the pristine
XNBR/NR (50/50) blend shows uniform dispersion of NR domains (spherical
or elliptical shaped) in the continuous XNBR matrix (Figure 1a). The size of the phase-separated
NR domains is around 4–5 μm (Figure 1a). In line with the TEM image (Figure 1a), the AFM phase
image of the pristine XNBR/NR (50/50) blend also shows uniform dispersion
of bright NR domains in the dark XNBR matrix (Figure 1b). The size of the dispersed NR domains
is around 4–5 μm (Figure 1b). It is interesting to note here that the TEM micrograph
of the XNBR/NR (50/50) blend with 8 phr of sepiolite nanoclay shows
the selective localization of a higher percentage of sepiolite nanoclay
in the dispersed NR phase (Figure 1c). This observation is consistent with the prediction
that higher concentration of sepiolite nanoclay will selectively localize
in the NR phase when compared to the XNBR phase if we use toluene
as the solvent to prepare the XNBR/NR (50/50) blend and to disperse
sepiolite nanoclay. The average length, width, and thickness of the
individual sepiolite nanoclay needles are in the range of 450–500,
40–45, and 10–20 nm, respectively (Figure 1c). The dimensions of the sepiolite
nanoclay needles reported here are in accord with the dimensions of
the sepiolite nanoclay needles reported in the literature.22−25 It
is also clear that the sepiolite nanoclay needles show nanodispersion,
and there is no sign of aggregation. It should be pointed here that
some of the individual sepiolite nanoclay needles are aligned in a
way that they are tightly stitching the dispersed NR phase and the
continuous XNBR phase (Figure 1c). The AFM phase image of the XNBR/NR (50/50) blend with
8 phr of sepiolite nanoclay shows that a higher percentage of sepiolite
nanoclay particles is selectively localized in the dispersed brighter
NR phase in comparison to the continuous darker XNBR phase (Figure 1d). The dimensions
of the individual sepiolite nanoclay needles as observed in the AFM
phase image correlate well with the dimensions of the individual sepiolite
nanoclay needles as observed in the TEM micrograph (Figure 1c). From the AFM phase image,
it can also be seen that some portion of the individual sepiolite
nanoclay needles are protruding into the continuous XNBR phase from
the dispersed NR phase. This again confirms that the sepiolite nanoclay
needles stitch the dispersed NR phase and continuous XNBR phase of
the incompatible XNBR/NR (50/50) blend. This is a very unique observation
reported for the first time in the literature. Elias et al. have shown
that selective accumulation of nanoparticles at the interface in a
polymer blend can significantly decrease the particle size of the
dispersed phase and lead to increased compatibility and enhanced properties.10 However, here, the addition of sepiolite nanoclay
to the XNBR/NR (50/50) blend prominently improves the overall properties
without reducing the particle size of the dispersed NR phase. The
possible reasons for the prominent enhancement of the overall blend
properties by the addition of sepiolite nanoclay are because of the
selective localization of sepiolite nanoclay in the NR phase (discussed
later) and possibly because of the stitching effect produced by individual
sepiolite nanoclay needles.

(50NR/50XNBR)T; (b) AFM phase image of (50NR/50XNBR)T; (c) TEM micrograph of (50NR/50XNBR)T/8SEPT; (d) AFM phase image of (50NR/50XNBR)T/8SEPT; and (e) XRD curves of pristine sepiolite nanoclay, NRT/8SEPT, XNBRT/8SEPT, and
(50NR/50XNBR)T/8SEPT.

The nanocomposites have been characterized
by XRD to understand the dispersion of sepiolite nanoclay in the rubber
and rubber blend matrix. The X-ray diffractogram of the pristine sepiolite
nanoclay shows a strong peak at 2θ = 7.28° (d-spacing of 1.22 nm) (Figure 1e). This peak mainly arises due to the reflections from the
internal channels of the needlelike structure of sepiolite nanoclay.22−26 The pristine NR containing 8 phr of sepiolite
nanoclay, pristine XNBR containing 8 phr of sepiolite nanoclay, and
the XNBR/NR (50/50) blend containing 8 phr of sepiolite nanoclay also
register strong XRD peaks in the vicinity of 7.28° (Figure 1e). This is in line
with the earlier observations that sepiolite is a non-expandable nanoclay,
and exfoliation cannot take place in the polymer matrix.22−26 Here, selective localization of sepiolite
nanoclay in the NR phase prominently enhances the blend properties
(discussed later) in spite of the fact that exfoliation does not take
place. It has been shown by various authors that although exfoliation
will not take place, sepiolite nanoclay can significantly improve
the mechanical properties because it can be very easily dispersed
in rubber matrices because of its very low specific surface area.22−26 It should be pointed here that there is
a decrease in the peak intensity in the case of nanocomposite samples.
It is well known that sepiolite nanoclay needles normally show tendency
to stick together and form aggregated bundles of fibres.27−30 The
strong interactions between the blend components (NR and XNBR) and
the sepiolite nanoclay needles together with the shear involved during
mixing tend to destroy the agglomerated structures. This ultimately
leads to the nanodispersion of sepiolite nanoclay and results in the
reduction of the peak intensities in the nanocomposite samples.

2.1.3 Dynamic Mechanical
Properties
2.1.3.1 Quantitative Estimation of the Amount of Sepiolite Nanoclay Selectively
Localized in the NR Phase and XNBR Phase of the XNBR/XR (50/50) Blend
The dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) tan δ versus temperature
plots for pristine NR, pristine XNBR, and pristine XNBR/NR (50/50)
blend are shown in the inset of Figure 2a. Pristine NR presents a peak around −55 °C,
showing its glass transition temperature (Tg) (Table 2). It has
been observed that the tan δ curve of NR with 8 phr of sepiolite
nanoclay is similar to that of pristine NR, except that there is a
reduction in the tan δ peak height (Table 2). Pristine XNBR shows a peak at −9
°C, corresponding to its Tg (Table 2). It is clear that
the tan δ curve of XNBR with 8 phr of sepiolite nanoclay is
similar to that of pristine XNBR, except that there is a reduction
in the tan δ peak height (Table 2). It is well known that the reduction in the tan δ
peak height by addition of any reinforcing filler can be attributed
to the increased population of immobilized rubber chains.23,31 The pristine XNBR/NR (50/50) blend presents two peaks around −50
and −6 °C, corresponding to the Tg of NR and XNBR, respectively (Figure 2a). Whereas, the 8 phr sepiolite nanoclay-loaded
XNBR/NR (50/50) blend shows the Tg value
of NR and XNBR close to −48 and −8 °C, respectively
(Figure 2a). With the
incorporation of sepiolite nanoclay into the XNBR/NR (50/50) blend,
the Tg of NR is shown to shift to a higher
temperature and the Tg of XNBR shifts
to a lower temperature (Table 2). It is expected that sepiolite nanoclay can have good compatibility
with both the NR phase and the XNBR phase of the XNBR/NR (50/50) blend.
The silanol groups present on the sepiolite nanoclay ends and edges
can interact with the carboxyl groups present in the XNBR rubber.
Darder et al. have shown that hydrogen bonding can be established
between the functional groups present in the polymers and the silanol
groups present on the edges of the sepiolite nanoclay needles.32 It is also well known that sepiolite nanoclay
particles show good affinity to NR because the surface energy values
of sepiolite and NR are in close vicinity to each other.33 Accordingly, sepiolite nanoclay has enhanced
the interactions and compatibility between XNBR and NR in the NR/XNBR
blend, which shifts the Tg of NR to a
higher temperature and shifts the Tg of
XNBR to a lower temperature. Zhang et al. have studied the effect
of incorporation of GO into the XNBR/SBR latex blend.34 It has been reported that with the addition of GO, the Tg of SBR shifts to a higher temperature and
the Tg of XNBR shifts to a lower temperature.34 Addition of GO introduces interactions between
XNBR and SBR, thus improving the miscibility and compatibility between
the blend components.34 The tan δ
peak heights of NR and XNBR in the pristine XNBR/NR (50/50) blend
are 0.75 and 0.45, respectively (Table 2). On the other hand, the tan δ peak heights
of NR and XNBR in the XNBR/NR (50/50) blend with 8 phr of sepiolite
nanoclay are 0.34 and 0.36, respectively (Table 2). The reduction in the tan δ peak
height by the addition of sepiolite nanoclay indicates the enhanced
rubber–nanoclay interaction, which results in restricted segmental
mobility of polymer chains. The tan δ peak height of NR in the
XNBR/NR (50/50) blend with 8 phr of sepiolite nanoclay is much lower
than the tan δ peak height of NR in the pristine XNBR/NR (50/50)
blend (Table 2). On
the other hand, the tan δ peak height of XNBR in the XNBR/NR
(50/50) blend with 8 phr of sepiolite nanoclay is in close vicinity
to the tan δ peak height of XNBR in the pristine XNBR/NR (50/50)
blend (Table 2). This
confirms that sepiolite nanoclay shows greater interaction with the
NR phase when compared to the XNBR phase in the XNBR/NR (50/50) blend
if we use toluene for dissolving the blend and for preparing sepiolite
nanoclay dispersion.

In the literature, it has been shown that
from the extent of reduction in the tan δ peak heights corresponding
to the continuous phase and dispersed phase (in a polymer blend) by
the addition of filler, it is possible to quantitatively estimate
the amount of filler present in the phases of the polymer blend using
the equation given below.1,14,20 3  where
tan δmax is the tan δ curve peak (maxima in
tan δ), and uf and f correspond to the unfilled (gum) and filler-loaded
systems, respectively. R correlates with the filler
to weight fraction of polymer (ω) according to the equation
given below 4  where α corresponds to the interaction parameter between the
polymer/filler. Applying eq 4 for individual polymer and polymer blend systems yields the
below equations 5   6   7   8  where subscripts 1 and
2 correspond to the individual blend components, and the notations
denoted by prime symbols correspond to the polymer blend system; ω1′ and ω2′ represent
the filler weight fraction to total polymer (in polymer blend) distributed
in polymer 1 and polymer 2, respectively. Accordingly, the total filler
weight fraction, ω, in the polymer blend can be obtained by
adding ω1′ and ω2′. 9  

By assuming α1/α2 = α1′/α2′, eqs 5 and 8 will yield 10  

The weight fraction
of the filler in the phases of polymer blend (ω1′) can be
determined from eqs 9 and 10 as shown below: 11  

The amount of sepiolite nanoclay selectively localized in
the dispersed NR phase and in the continuous XNBR phase of the XNBR/NR
(50/50) blend (when we use toluene for dissolving the blend and for
preparing sepiolite nanoclay dispersion) has been obtained using eq 11, and the values are
shown in Table 3.

Localized in the NR Phase and in the XNBR Phase of the XNBR/NR (50/50)
Blend
Sl. no.	sample
code	amount of sepiolite nanoclay localized

(38%)	
2	(50NR/50XNBR)C/8SEPM	3.18 (39%)	4.82 (61%)	
It is evident from Table 3 that around 62% of sepiolite nanoclay selectively localizes
in the NR phase of the XNBR/NR (50/50) blend. It should be pointed
here that this is in accordance with the earlier prediction that a
higher percentage of sepiolite nanoclay will selectively localize
in the dispersed NR phase when we use toluene for dissolving the blend
and for preparing sepiolite nanoclay dispersion. In the literature,
several authors have used the above methodology (DMA tan δ vs
temperature plots) to understand the distribution of different fillers
in the phases of various rubber blends.1,14,20,35−41

is shown in the inset of Figure 2b. A comparison between pristine NR and pristine XNBR
shows that the modulus (at 25 °C) of pristine NR is higher compared
to that of pristine XNBR (Table 2). The modulus (at 25 °C) of the pristine blend
lies between the modulus of pristine NR and pristine XNBR (Table 2). The modulus (at
25 °C) of NR increases considerably with the incorporation of
8 phr of sepiolite nanoclay (Table 2). This is because NR exhibits excellent compatibility
with sepiolite nanoclay when we use toluene for dissolving NR and
for preparing sepiolite nanoclay dispersion (as discussed earlier).
However, the modulus (at 25 °C) of XNBR does not enhance considerably
by incorporating 8 phr of sepiolite nanoclay (Table 2). This is because XNBR exhibits relatively
a limited compatibility with sepiolite nanoclay when we use toluene
for dissolving XNBR and for preparing sepiolite nanoclay dispersion
(as discussed earlier). The elastic modulus versus temperature plots
of the pristine XNBR/NR (50/50) blend and the XNBR/NR (50/50) blend
with 8 phr of sepiolite nanoclay are shown in Figure 2b. The modulus (at 25 °C) of the XNBR/NR
(50/50) blend containing 8 phr of sepiolite nanoclay is around 140%
higher than the modulus (at 25 °C) of the pristine XNBR/NR (50/50)
blend (see Table 2).

2.1.4 Tensile Property
Studies
The stress versus strain curves of pristine NR, pristine
XNBR, NR containing 8 phr of sepiolite nanoclay, and XNBR containing
8 phr of sepiolite nanoclay are shown in the inset of Figure 3. It has been observed that
the breaking stress and stress at 100% strain of pristine NR are 0.42
and 0.29 MPa, respectively (Table 4). On the other hand, the breaking stress and stress
at 100% strain of pristine XNBR are 0.30 and 0.26 MPa, respectively
(Table 4). The strain
at the break of pristine NR is lower than the strain at the break
of pristine XNBR (Table 4). The breaking stress and stress at 100% strain of NR significantly
enhance by the addition of 8 phr of sepiolite nanoclay (Table 4). On the other hand, the breaking
stress and stress at 100% strain of XNBR do not significantly enhance
with the incorporation of 8 phr of sepiolite nanoclay (Table 4). The stress versus strain
curves of the pristine XNBR/NR (50/50) blend and the XNBR/NR (50/50)
blend with 8 phr of sepiolite nanoclay are shown in Figure 3. The breaking stress, stress
at 100% strain, and strain at the break of the pristine XNBR/NR (50/50)
blend lie in between the breaking stress, stress at 100% strain, and
strain at the break of pristine NR and pristine XNBR (Table 4). The breaking stress, stress
at 100% strain, and strain at the break of the pristine XNBR/NR (50/50)
blend continuously increase with increasing sepiolite nanoclay content
(Table 4). It is very
important to understand how the selective localization of a higher
percentage of sepiolite nanoclay in the dispersed NR phase of the
XNBR/NR (50/50) blend prominently increases the DMA elastic modulus
(at 25 °C) and the stress–strain properties (breaking
stress, stress at 100% strain, and strain at break) of the incompatible
XNBR/NR (50/50) blend. The possible reasons for the above behavior
have been discussed in the subsequent paragraph.

Sepiolite nanoclay
shows better interaction with the NR phase when compared to the XNBR
phase when toluene is used for dissolving the blend and for preparing
sepiolite nanoclay dispersion (as discussed earlier). Accordingly,
a higher percentage of sepiolite nanoclay selectively localizes in
the NR phase of the XNBR/NR (50/50) blend. The well-dispersed sepiolite
nanoclay in the NR phase can prominently enhance the strength of NR
phase in the XNBR/NR (50/50) blend, which in turn can lead to enhanced
blend properties. In addition, the sepiolite nanoclay needles lead
to better interaction between the NR phase and XNBR phase (as discussed
in DMA studies) by aligning themselves (stitching effect) across the
interface in the XNBR/NR (50/50) blend (Figure 1c,d). This can also significantly enhance
the overall blend properties.

2.2 XNBR/NR (50/50) Blend Dissolved in Chloroform and
Sepiolite Nanoclay Dispersed in Methyl Ethyl Ketone (MEK)
2.2.1 Calculation of the Difference
Value between the Interaction Parameter of Rubber (Either XNBR or
NR)/Chloroform and the Interaction Parameter of Sepiolite Nanoclay/MEK
To selectively localize a higher amount of sepiolite nanoclay in
the XNBR phase of the XNBR/NR (50/50) blend, chloroform is selected
as the solvent for preparing the blend, and MEK is selected as the
solvent for preparing sepiolite nanoclay dispersion. The difference
value between the interaction parameter of NR–chloroform and
the interaction parameter of sepiolite nanoclay–MEK has been
identified from the equation below and the values are reported in Table 1. 12  where χA′B′ is the interaction parameter of NR–chloroform and χC′D′ is the interaction parameter of sepiolite
nanoclay–MEK. The χA′B′ (0.141)
and χC′D′ (0.012) values have been
calculated from the Hildebrand equation.20−22 The solubility parameter values of MEK and
chloroform are taken from the literature.20−22

The difference value between the interaction
parameter of XNBR–chloroform and the interaction parameter
of sepiolite nanoclay–MEK has been identified from the equation
below, and the values are shown in Table 1. 13  where χX′Y′ is the interaction parameter between XNBR–chloroform. The
χX′Y′ (0.020) value has been calculated
from the Hildebrand equation.20−22

The lower interaction parameter value of XNBR–chloroform
(χX′Y′) when compared to the interaction
parameter value of NR–chloroform (χA′B′) confirms the excellent compatibility between XNBR and chloroform
in comparison to the compatibility between NR and chloroform. As the
difference value between the interaction parameter of XNBR–chloroform
and the interaction parameter of sepiolite nanoclay–MEK is
lower than the difference value between the interaction parameter
of NR–chloroform and the interaction parameter of sepiolite
nanoclay–MEK, it is predicted that the higher concentration
of sepiolite nanoclay should selectively localize in the XNBR phase
when compared to the NR phase in the XNBR/NR (50/50) blend. The above
prediction regarding the selective localization of the higher percentage
of sepiolite nanoclay in the XNBR phase of the XNBR/NR (50/50) blend
has been validated in the forthcoming sections.

2.2.2 Morphological Analysis by
TEM, AFM, and XRD
The TEM micrograph of the pristine XNBR/NR
(50/50) blend prepared using chloroform as the solvent shows uniform
dispersion of NR domains (having particles size in the range of 5–6
μm) in the continuous XNBR matrix (Figure 4a). In line with the TEM micrograph (Figure 4a), the AFM phase
image of the pristine XNBR/NR (50/50) blend prepared using chloroform
as the solvent shows a uniform dispersion of NR domains (having particles
size in the range of 5–6 μm) in the continuous XNBR matrix
(Figure 4b). It is
interesting to note here that the TEM micrograph of the XNBR/NR (50/50)
blend containing 8 phr of sepiolite nanoclay shows selective localization
of a higher percentage of sepiolite nanoclay in the continuous XNBR
phase (Figure 4c).
This observation is consistent with the prediction that higher concentration
of sepiolite nanoclay will selectively localize in the XNBR phase
when compared to the NR phase if we use chloroform as the solvent
to prepare the XNBR/NR (50/50) blend and if we use MEK as the solvent
to disperse sepiolite nanoclay. It should be pointed here that the
sepiolite nanoclay needles are uniformly distributed and show nanodispersion
in the XNBR phase. The average length, width, and thickness of the
individual sepiolite nanoclay needles are in the range of 450–500,
40–45, and 10–20 nm, respectively (Figure 4c). Because a higher percentage
of sepiolite nanoclay needles are localized in the XNBR phase, there
is no prominent stitching effect of sepiolite nanoclay needles across
the interface (Figure 4c). However, at few places, some portions of the individual sepiolite
nanoclay needles protrude into the NR phase from the XNBR phase (Figure 4c). The preferential
localization of the higher percentage of sepiolite nanoclay in the
XNBR phase does not reduce the particle size of the dispersed NR phase.
It is worth mentioning here that there is no considerable enhancement
in the blend properties because of selective localization of sepiolite
nanoclay in the XNBR phase (discussed later). From the AFM phase image
of the XNBR/NR (50/50) blend with 8 phr of sepiolite nanoclay, it
is clear that a higher percentage of sepiolite nanoclay particles
is present in the XNBR phase in comparison to the brighter NR phase
(Figure 4d). The dimension
of the individual sepiolite nanoclay needles as observed by the AFM
phase image (Figure 4d) correlate well with the dimension of the individual sepiolite
nanoclay needles as observed by the TEM micrograph (Figure 4b). The AFM phase image also
clearly reveals that there is no prominent stitching effect of the
sepiolite nanoclay needles across the phases of the XNBR/NR (50/50)
blend. The X-ray diffractograms of the nanocomposites have peak positions
in the range of 7.28 (2θ) (Figure 4e). The X-ray diffractogram of pristine sepiolite
nanoclay also shows a peak at 7.28 (2θ) (Figure 1e). This again reconfirms the non-expandable
nature of sepiolite nanoclay (as discussed earlier). The reduction
in the peak intensity in the nanocomposite samples validates the nanodispersion
of sepiolite nanoclay in NR, XNBR, and XNBR/NR (50/50) blend.

2.2.3 Dynamic Mechanical Properties
2.2.3.1 Quantitative Estimation
of the Amount of Sepiolite Nanoclay Selectively Localized in the NR
Phase and XNBR Phase of the XNBR/NR (50/50) Blend
The tan
δ versus temperature plots for pristine NR, pristine XNBR, and
pristine XNBR/NR (50/50) blend are shown in the inset of Figure 5a. Pristine NR presents
a peak about −55 °C, showing its Tg (Table 2).
It has been observed that the tan δ curve of NR with 8 phr of
sepiolite nanoclay is similar to that of pristine NR, except that
there is a reduction in the tan δ peak height (Table 2). Pristine XNBR shows a peak
at −9 °C, corresponding to its Tg (Table 2).
The tan δ curve of XNBR with 8 phr of sepiolite nanoclay is
similar to that of pristine XNBR, except that there is a reduction
in the tan δ peak height (Table 2). The pristine XNBR/NR (50/50) blend presents two
peaks around −50 and −6 °C, corresponding to Tg of NR and XNBR, respectively (Table 2). It is interesting to note
that the 8 phr sepiolite nanoclay-loaded XNBR/NR (50/50) blend shows Tg values of NR and XNBR at −50 and −6
°C, respectively (Figure 5a). With the incorporation of sepiolite nanoclay, there is
no shift in the Tg of NR to higher temperature,
and there is no shift in the Tg of XNBR
to lower temperature (Table 2). This can be due to the existence of minimum interactions
between the blend components (NR and XNBR) because of the selective
localization of sepiolite nanoclay needles in XNBR phase and also
due to the absence of a prominent stitching effect of the sepiolite
nanoclay needles. The tan δ peak heights of NR and XNBR in the
pristine XNBR/NR (50/50) blend are 0.68 and 0.52, respectively (Table 2). On the other hand,
the tan δ peak heights of NR and XNBR in the XNBR/NR (50/50)
blend with 8 phr of sepiolite nanoclay are 0.55 and 0.28, respectively
(Table 2). The tan
δ peak height of XNBR in the XNBR/NR (50/50) blend with 8 phr
of sepiolite nanoclay is much lower than the tan δ peak height
of XNBR in the pristine XNBR/NR (50/50) blend (Table 2). On the other hand, the tan δ peak
height of NR in the XNBR/NR (50/50) blend with 8 phr of sepiolite
nanoclay is in close vicinity to the tan δ peak height of NR
in the pristine XNBR/NR (50/50) blend (Table 2). This confirms that sepiolite nanoclay
shows excellent interaction with the XNBR phase when compared to the
NR phase in the XNBR/NR (50/50) blend when we use chloroform as the
solvent for preparing the blend, and MEK as the solvent for preparing
the sepiolite nanoclay dispersion.

and (50NR/50XNBR)C and (b) elastic modulus, E′, vs temperature plots of (50NR/50XNBR)C and (50NR/50XNBR)C/8SEPM. Inset: Elastic modulus, E′, vs temperature plots of NRC, XNBRC, and (50NR/50XNBR)C.

The amount of sepiolite nanoclay
selectively localized in the dispersed NR phase and in the continuous
XNBR phase of the XNBR/NR (50/50) blend (when we use chloroform as
the solvent for preparing the blend and MEK as the solvent for preparing
sepiolite nanoclay dispersion) has been identified using eq 11, and the values are
shown in Table 3.

It is evident from Table 3 that around 61% of sepiolite nanoclay selectively localizes
in the XNBR phase of the XNBR/NR (50/50) blend. It should be pointed
here that this is in accordance with the earlier prediction that a
higher percentage of sepiolite nanoclay will selectively localize
in the continuous XNBR phase when we use chloroform as the solvent
for preparing the blend and MEK as the solvent for preparing the sepiolite
nanoclay dispersion.

2.2.3.2 DMA Elastic Modulus Versus Temperature Studies
The
elastic modulus (E′) versus temperature curves
for pristine NR, pristine XNBR, and pristine XNBR/NR (50/50) blend
is shown in the inset of Figure 5b. A comparison between pristine NR and pristine XNBR
shows that the modulus (at 25 °C) of pristine NR is higher compared
to that of pristine XNBR (Table 2). The modulus (at 25 °C) of the pristine blend
lies between the modulus of pristine NR and pristine XNBR (Table 2). The modulus (at
25 °C) of XNBR enhances considerably by the incorporation of
8 phr of sepiolite nanoclay (Table 2). This is because XNBR exhibits excellent compatibility
with sepiolite nanoclay when we use chloroform for dissolving XNBR
and MEK for preparing sepiolite nanoclay dispersion (as discussed
earlier). On the other hand, the modulus (at 25 °C) of NR does
not enhance considerably by the incorporation of 8 phr of sepiolite
nanoclay (Table 2).
This is because NR exhibits limited compatibility with sepiolite nanoclay
when we use chloroform for dissolving NR and MEK for preparing sepiolite
nanoclay dispersion (as discussed earlier). The elastic modulus versus
temperature plots of the pristine XNBR/NR (50/50) blend and the XNBR/NR
(50/50) blend with 8 phr of sepiolite nanoclay are shown in Figure 5b. The modulus (at
25 °C) of the 8 phr sepiolite nanoclay-loaded XNBR/NR (50/50)
blend is around 39% higher than the modulus (at 25 °C) of the
pristine XNBR/NR (50/50) blend (see Table 2). It is worth mentioning here that selective
localization of a higher percentage of sepiolite nanoclay in the XNBR
phase does not prominently enhance the modulus (at 25 °C) of
the XNBR/NR (50/50) blend. On the other hand, as discussed earlier,
selective localization of a higher percentage of sepiolite nanoclay
in the NR phase significantly enhances the modulus (at 25 °C)
of the XNBR/NR (50/50) blend. The reasons for the above behavior have
been explained in the forthcoming section.

2.2.4 Tensile Property Studies
The stress versus strain curves of pristine NR, pristine XNBR,
NR containing 8 phr of sepiolite nanoclay, and XNBR containing 8 phr
of sepiolite nanoclay are shown in the inset of Figure 6. It has been observed that the breaking
stress and stress at 100% strain of pristine NR are 0.38 and 0.23
MPa, respectively (Table 4). The breaking stress and stress at 100% strain of pristine
XNBR are 0.31 and 0.29, MPa respectively (Table 4). The strain at the break of pristine NR
is lower than the strain at the break of pristine XNBR (Table 4). The breaking stress and stress
at 100% strain of XNBR significantly increase with the addition of
8 phr of sepiolite nanoclay (Table 4). On the other hand, the breaking stress and stress
at 100% strain of NR do not significantly enhance with the incorporation
of 8 phr of sepiolite nanoclay (Table 4). The stress versus strain curves of the pristine
XNBR/NR (50/50) blend and the XNBR/NR (50/50) blend with 8 phr of
sepiolite nanoclay are shown in Figure 6. The breaking stress, stress at 100% strain, and strain
at the break of the pristine XNBR/NR (50/50) blend lie in between
the breaking stress, stress at 100% strain, and strain at the break
of pristine NR and pristine XNBR (Table 4). The breaking stress, stress at 100% strain,
and strain at the break of the pristine XNBR/NR (50/50) blend do not
significantly enhance by the incorporation of 8 phr of sepiolite nanoclay
(Table 4). It is instructive
to know why the selective localization of the higher percentage of
sepiolite nanoclay in the dispersed XNBR phase of the XNBR/NR (50/50)
blend does not significantly increases the DMA elastic modulus (at
25 °C) and the stress–strain properties (breaking stress
and stress at 100% strain and strain at break) of the incompatible
XNBR/NR (50/50) blend.

blend and the XNBR/NR (50/50) blend/sepiolite nanocomposite. Inset:
Tensile properties of pristine NR, pristine XNBR, NR/sepiolite nanocomposite,
and XNBR/sepiolite nanocomposite.

Sepiolite nanoclay shows better interaction
with the continuous XNBR phase when compared to the dispersed NR phase
when we use chloroform for preparing the blend and MEK for preparing
sepiolite nanoclay dispersion (as discussed earlier). Accordingly,
a higher percentage of sepiolite nanoclay selectively localizes in
the XNBR phase of the XNBR/NR (50/50) blend. Consequently, the NR
phase loses a larger percentage of sepiolite nanoclay, and the XNBR
phase receives a higher percentage of sepiolite nanoclay. There will
be a significant drop in the strength of the NR phase in the XNBR/NR
(50/50) blend because a major portion of sepiolite nanoclay has migrated
to the XNBR phase. The extent of reduction in the strength of the
NR phase by losing sepiolite nanoclay overcomes the extent of enhancement
in the strength of the XNBR phase by accumulating sepiolite nanoclay.
This ultimately does not contribute to the improvement of the blend
properties to a greater extent. In addition, the presence of a higher
percentage of sepiolite nanoclay in the XNBR phase does not increase
the interaction between the NR phase and XNBR phase (as discussed
in DMA studies) because there is no prominent stitching effect of
the sepiolite nanoclay needles across the interface. Accordingly,
there is no prominent increase in the overall blend properties.

3 Conclusions
1. A unique approach
for selectively localizing needle-shaped sepiolite nanoclay in the
dispersed NR phase and in the continuous XNBR phase of the incompatible
XNBR/NR (50/50) blend and its effect on the overall blend properties
have been studied by considering various thermodynamic governing factors.
It has been found that 62% of sepiolite nanoclay (at 8 phr) selectively
localizes in the dispersed NR phase when toluene is used as the solvent
for dissolving the XNBR/NR (50/50) blend and for preparing the sepiolite
nanoclay dispersion. This is because the difference value between
the interaction parameter of NR–toluene and the interaction
parameter of sepiolite nanoclay–toluene is low (χNR/toluene – χsepiolite nanoclay/toluene = 0.04) in comparison to the difference value between the interaction
parameter of XNBR–toluene and the interaction parameter of
sepiolite nanoclay–toluene (χXNBR/toluene –
χsepiolite nanoclay/toluene = 0.07). Selective localization
of sepiolite nanoclay in the dispersed NR phase increases the strength
of the NR phase in the XNBR/NR (50/50) blend because of the excellent
compatibility between NR and sepiolite nanoclay when toluene is used
as the solvent for dissolving the XNBR/NR (50/50) blend and for preparing
sepiolite nanoclay dispersion. This significantly increases the tensile
properties and the DMA elastic modulus (at 25 °C) value of the
incompatible XNBR/NR (50/50) blend. Morphological studies reveal that
the sepiolite nanoclay needles are aligned in a way that the continuous
phase (XNBR) and the dispersed phase (NR) of the incompatible XNBR/NR
(50/50) blend are tightly stitched together by the needle-shaped sepiolite
nanoclay. This increases the interactions between the blend components
and prominently improves the overall blend properties.

2. It has been observed that 61% of sepiolite
nanoclay selectively localizes in the XNBR phase when chloroform is
used as the solvent for dissolving the XNBR/NR (50/50) blend and MEK
is used as the solvent for preparing the sepiolite nanoclay dispersion.
This is because the difference value between the interaction parameter
of XNBR–chloroform and the interaction parameter of sepiolite
nanoclay–MEK is lower (χXNBR/chloroform –
χsepiolite nanoclay/MEK = 0.00) when compared to
the difference value between the interaction parameter of NR–chloroform
and the interaction parameter of sepiolite nanoclay–MEK (χNR/chloroform – χsepiolite nanoclay/MEK = 0.12). The selective localization of sepiolite nanoclay in the
XNBR phase does not significantly improve the tensile properties and
the DMA elastic modulus (at 25 °C) value of the XNBR/NR (50/50)
blend. This is attributed to the reduction in the strength of the
NR phase in the incompatible XNBR/NR (50/50) blend when a higher percentage
of sepiolite nanoclay localizes in the XNBR phase. The extent of reduction
in the strength of the NR phase by losing sepiolite nanoclay overcomes
the extent of enhancement in the strength of the XNBR phase by accumulating
sepiolite nanoclay. This ultimately does not contribute to the improvement
of the blend properties to a greater extent. In addition, localization
of the higher percentage of sepiolite nanoclay in the XNBR phase reduces
the stitching effect of the sepiolite nanoclay needles across the
phases of the XNBR/NR (50/50) blend. This reduces the interactions
between the blend components and does not contribute to the prominent
enhancement of the overall blend properties.

acrylonitrile groups, Mooney viscosity, ML1+4 at 100 °C
= 47 ± 5, specific gravity = 0.99, was purchased from Lanxess,
Cologne, Germany. ISNR 3CV (NR), having Mooney Viscosity, ML1+4 at 100 °C = 63 ± 5, was purchased from Rubber Research
Institute of India, Kottayam, India. Pangel B20 (sepiolite nanoclay)
was procured from Tolsa S.A., Empres, Mercedes, Spain. Pangel B20
sepiolite nanoclay is an organophilic needlelike nanoclay containing
ribbons of 2:1 phyllosilicate structure with a significant number
of silanol groups (SiOH) at its edges. Individual sepiolite fibers
generally range from 10 nm to 5 μm in length, 10–30 nm
width, and 5–10 nm thickness with an aspect ratio ranging from

procured from Sigma-Aldrich, New Delhi, India.

4.2 Synthesis of Samples
4.2.1 Synthesis of Pristine Rubber Samples and
Rubber Nanocomposite Samples
XNBR (4 g) or NR (4 g) was swollen
in a known amount (80 mL) of solvent (toluene or chloroform) and stirred
thoroughly by using a magnetic stirrer for 10 h (1000 rpm at 25 °C).
Once the stirring was completed, the rubber solution was poured into
a glass Petri dish and dried for 4 days at room temperature until
there was no weight change. For preparing rubber nanocomposite samples,
the neat rubber solutions were prepared as per the procedure described
above. Nanoclay was dispersed in a desired solvent (either MEK or
toluene) by an ultrasonicator for 1 h at a frequency of 25 kHz at
25 °C. The dispersion of nanoclay was incorporated into the prepared
rubber solution. The stirring was continued again for 9 h using a
magnetic stirrer (1000 rpm at 25 °C). Once the stirring was completed,
the rubber nanocomposite solution was poured into a glass Petri dish

4.2.2 Synthesis of Pristine Rubber Blend Samples and Rubber Blend
Nanocomposite Samples
XNBR (2 g) and NR (2 g), to prepare
the XNBR/NR (50/50) blend, was swollen in a known amount (80 mL) of
solvent (toluene or chloroform) and stirred thoroughly for 10 h using
a magnetic stirrer (1000 rpm at 25 °C). Once the stirring was
completed, the rubber blend solution was poured into a glass Petri
dish and dried for 4 days at room temperature until there was no weight
change. For preparing rubber blend nanocomposite samples, the neat
rubber blend solutions were prepared as per the procedure described
above. Nanoclay was dispersed in a desired solvent (either MEK or
toluene) by an ultrasonicator for 1 h at a frequency of 25 kHz at
25 °C. The dispersion of nanoclay was incorporated into the prepared
rubber blend solution. The stirring was continued again for 9 h using
a magnetic stirrer (1000 rpm at 25 °C). Once the stirring was
completed, the rubber blend nanocomposite solution was poured into
a glass Petri dish and dried for 4 days at room temperature until
there was no weight change. The samples prepared are reported in Table 5.

4.3 Characterization Techniques
TEM was used to study the bulk morphology of the samples. The sample
preparation for TEM was done by ultra-cryomicrotomy at −100
°C (which was well below the glass transition temperature (Tg) values of NR and XNBR). A JEOL 2011 instrument
(Japan) with a LaB6 electron source operating at 200 kV
was used for TEM imaging. AFM was used to study the surface morphology
of the samples. A multimode AFM instrument from Bruker Dimension Icon
SPM (Massachusetts, USA) was used. Phase images were captured in the
PeakForce tapping mode at a set point ratio of 100 pN, using a long
tapping mode etched silicon probe (LTESP) tip with a ScanAsyst-Fluid
probe (spring constant in the range of 1.4 N/m). The cantilever was
oscillated at a resonance frequency (ω0) of 180 kHz.
XRD patterns were measured at 25 °C using a Rigaku Mini-flex
Diffractometer (Tokyo, Japan). The instrument was equipped with a
Cu filter under the following conditions: scan range (2θ) =
2°–10°; scan rate = 0.5°/min; and Cu Kα
radiation (λ) = 1.54 Å. A dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA
Q800, TA Instruments, New Castle, DE, USA) instrument was used to
study the dynamic mechanical property of the samples. Experiments
were carried out in tension mode at a strain amplitude of 0.01%, at
a constant sinusoidal frequency of 1 Hz, from −100 to 100 °C
at a heating ramp of 2 °C/min under a nitrogen atmosphere. The
selective localization of the sepiolite nanoclay needles in the continuous
phase and in the dispersed phase of the XNBR/NR (50/50) blend was
estimated from the DMA tan δ versus temperature curves. The
tensile stress–strain properties of the samples were estimated
using a universal testing machine (UTM, Zwick/Roell Z010, Ulm, Germany)
having a 10 kN load cell at a crosshead speed of 50 mm/min. The experiments
were conducted according to the ASTM D 412–98 test method using
dumbbell-shaped tensile specimens.

financial interest.
