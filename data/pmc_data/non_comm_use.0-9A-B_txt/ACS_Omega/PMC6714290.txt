The occurrence of the most important
mycotoxins (deoxynivalenol, fumonisin
B1 and B2, aflatoxins B1, B2, G1, and G2, ochratoxin A, zearalenone, T-2,
and HT-2 toxins) was determined in 64 extruded cat foods purchased
in Italy through ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with
tandem mass spectrometry. Deoxynivalenol and fumonisins were the most
common contaminants (quantified in 80 and 95% of the samples, respectively).
Conversely, aflatoxins B2, G1, and G2 were not identified in any sample. Some cat foods exceeded the regulatory
limit for aflatoxin B1 (n = 3) or the
guidance values for zearalenone (n = 3), fumonisins
(n = 2), ochratoxin A (n = 1), and
T-2 (n = 1) recently established for pets in the
European Union. A widespread co-occurrence of mycotoxins was observed
(28, 42, and 8% of the samples contained quantifiable amounts of two,
three, and four mycotoxins, respectively). This study describes criticisms
regarding the mycotoxin issue in pet food and suggests an improvement
of the monitoring of the pet food chain.

Introduction
Nowadays, feeding practice
based on commercially prepared pet food is extremely widespread throughout
the world since it represents an easy and economical way to meet the
nutrient requirements of dogs and cats at the various stages of their
life both in healthy and pathological conditions.

In consideration
of the current strict human–animal bond and the importance
of the feeding time perceived by pet owners as an opportunity of interaction
and gratification,1 pet food quality is
considered of great importance given its recognized connection to
pet health. In this regard, among recent concerns about pet food safety,
mycotoxin contamination represents a well-known problem.2 Mycotoxins are chemical compounds derived from
the secondary metabolism of various genera of fungi such as Aspergillus, Fusarium, and Penicillium that can grow on agricultural crops. Consequently, these toxins
are frequently detected in plant-based foods as well as animal feed.3

Although dogs and cats belong to the Carnivora
order, extruded pet food typically contains relatively high amounts
of cereals and cereal byproducts since the extrusion process, by favoring
starch gelatinization, makes starch easily digestible.4 Nevertheless, these particular processing conditions, even if characterized by high
pressures and temperatures, do not generally guarantee the complete
degradation/inactivation of mycotoxins possibly contaminating raw
ingredients.5 Consequently, extruded (or
commonly named “dry”) pet food results particularly
at risk of contamination, as proven by several surveys recently conducted
in various world regions6−17 (Table 1).

Awareness of the worldwide
occurrence of mycotoxins in food and feedstuffs, the consequent risks
to human and animal health, and the detrimental effects on global
trade have led in recent decades to the adoption of regulatory limits
for the most important mycotoxins found in food commodities18 and animal feed:19 aflatoxins, fumonisins, ochratoxins (OTA), zearalenone (ZEA), and
trichothecenes (in particular, deoxynivalenol (DON) and T-2 toxin
(T-2)). Consequently, these particular mycotoxins are considered the
most relevant from both a safety and economic perspective.

In the European Union (EU), legislation
concerning mycotoxin contamination in animal feeds (mostly for livestock
and only in regard to fumonisins for pets) has been promulgated in
the past.20,21

More recently, following some scientific
opinions provided by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA),22−24 specific “guidance values” recommended for DON, ZEA,
OTA, T-2, and HT-2 also referred to the compound feed intended for
dogs or cats have been introduced.25,26

Beyond
the detrimental consequences on economic performance and reputation
in the pet food industry, mycotoxin contamination poses severe health
risks to pet animals although current knowledge on the toxicological
effects in these species is limited.2 Moreover,
modern analytical methods based on liquid chromatography tandem mass
spectrometry (LC–MS/MS), allowing simultaneous determination
of different molecules, have recently highlighted the problem of mycotoxin
co-occurrence also in pet food products,9,14,16 as described for other animal feeds.27

The aim of the present study was to investigate the
occurrence of the most important mycotoxins that are currently covered
by EU legislation in the complete dry pet food intended for cats that
is commercially available in Italy.

Results
Chemical
analysis of the samples identified similar mean moisture and starch
contents in the two cat food categories evaluated. In fact, excluding
grain-free products, moisture contents were 46 ± 11 and 64 ±
14 g/kg, while starch contents were 259 ± 54 and 269 ± 35
g/kg (on a dry matter basis) in the premium and standard products,
respectively. In cat foods not containing cereals, moisture was 50
± 13 g/kg, and starch content was 186 ± 45 g/kg.

Positivity
for and concentrations of the different mycotoxins in the two cat
food categories are reported in Tables 3 and 4, respectively.

ZEA was identified in 75% of the samples. Higher concentrations
of this mycotoxin than those of the corresponding LOQ (5 μg/kg)
were found in 42% of the samples. Standard cat foods were less contaminated
than premium ones (8.89 vs 20.8 μg/kg, respectively; P < 0.05). Furthermore, in this last category, three
dietetic samples (one for obesity management and two for renal diseases),
containing 112, 101, and 104 μg of ZEA/kg, exceeded the reference
guidance value recently established for cats used for reproduction
and for kittens (100 μg/kg) (Figure 1). On the other hand, these three last samples
respected the limit referred to compound feed intended for adult cats
other than for reproduction (200 μg/kg).26

Figure 1 Samples of commercial dry cat food that did not comply with the
current EU legislation concerning mycotoxin contamination.

DON was quantified in 62% of the premium and 100%
of the standard cat foods (at concentrations ≥ the corresponding
LOQ, 3 μg/kg), with higher values in this last price category
(77.7 vs 209 μg/kg in premium and standard samples, respectively; P < 0.05). All of the positive samples resulted in compliance
with the corresponding European guidance value recommended for cat
food (5000 μg/kg).26

Concerning
aflatoxins, analyses revealed a general low occurrence among the cat
foods evaluated. In particular, no sample contained AFB2, AFG1, and AFG2 at levels above the corresponding
LOD (1 μg/kg) (Table 3). AFB1 was identified in trace amounts in 16%
of the samples (values > the corresponding LOD, 1 μg/kg,
but < the corresponding LOQ, 3 μg/kg) and quantified in eight
samples (one premium and seven standard cat foods) at concentrations
between 3 and 18.4 μg/kg. In particular, three of these last
positive samples (one premium sample for renal diseases and two standard
samples for adult cats), containing values of 17.4, 18.4, and 16.5
μg of AFB1/kg, exceeded the regulatory maximum content
established for compound feeds for animals other than for livestock
(10 μg/kg)20 (Figure 1).

Fumonisins were the most common
mycotoxins. With only one exception (represented by a grain-free product),
all of the samples presented at least one of the two types of fumonisins
evaluated (FB1 or FB2) at concentrations above
the corresponding LOD (1 μg/kg). In particular, FB1 and/or FB2 were quantified in 95% of the samples (their
concentration was ≥ the LOQ, 3 μg/kg), with no differences
between standard and premium samples. The average levels of total
fumonisins (FB1 + FB2) were relatively high
although a wide range of contaminations was found (overall mean concentration
of 1297 μg/kg and median concentration of 376 μg/kg).
Furthermore, two dietetic products formulated for obesity management
(containing 7494 and 7933 μg of total fumonisins/kg, respectively)
exceeded the corresponding guidance value for pets (5000 μg/kg)26 (Figure 1).

OTA was identified in seven standard samples among
which only two (both intended for adult cats) contained quantifiable
amounts of this mycotoxin (at concentrations of 5.1 and 14 μg/kg,
respectively). According to the current European guidance value for
compound feeds for dogs and cats (10 μg/kg),26 one sample was illegal (Figure 1).

Finally, T-2 and HT-2 were detected
in trace amounts (when the concentration was between the corresponding
LOD (5 μg/kg for both toxins) and LOQ (10 μg/kg for T-2
and 20 μg/kg for HT-2)) in 28 and 11% of the total samples,
respectively. Only T-2 was quantified in five samples (two standard
and three premium), with mean and maximum concentrations of 35.6 and
69.6 μg/kg, respectively. This last value, found in a dietetic
product intended for cats affected by gastrointestinal diseases, was
higher than the current guidance value established for T-2 + HT-2
regarding compound feeds for cats (corresponding to 50 μg/kg)26 (Figure 1).

In regard to grain-free products, one sample did
not contain detectable levels of any mycotoxin, while in the other
four samples, only fumonisins were quantified (at concentrations ≥
the corresponding LOQ, 3 μg/kg) in a range between 11.1 and
125 μg of FB1 + FB2/kg.

The present
study showed that 80% of the cat foods evaluated (51 of 64 samples)
contained quantifiable concentrations of at least two types of mycotoxins.
In particular, 28% of the cat foods (11 standard and 7 premium samples)
were contaminated by two different mycotoxins (among which 89% contained
DON + fumonisins), 42% (14 standard and 13 premium samples) by three
(among which 82% contained ZEA + DON + fumonisins), 8% (3 standard
and 2 premium samples) by four, and 2% (1 standard sample) by five
mycotoxins (ZEA + DON + fumonisins + OTA + AFB1) (Table 5). The simultaneous
quantification of at least DON and fumonisins (FB1 and/or
FB2) was the most frequent: 77% of the samples evaluated
(29 standard and 20 premium) revealed measurable concentrations of
these two Fusarium mycotoxins.

In regard to the correlation
study between starch content (on a dry matter basis) and mycotoxin
concentration, only total fumonisins, ZEA, and DON were considered
because of their widespread occurrence in over half of the samples.
Nevertheless, the Pearson coefficient test failed to show a linear
relationship for all three mycotoxins evaluated (r = 0.058, r = 0.002, and r = 0.195
in regard to the correlation between starch content and total fumonisins,
ZEA, and DON, respectively).

Discussion
The present monitoring
compared, for the first time, the occurrence of the most important
mycotoxins in cat food with the guidance values for pets that were
recently introduced by EU legislation.26 Based on our results, a relatively high number of samples (five
premium dietetic samples and three standard samples for adult cats)
exceeded the European regulatory limits established for some mycotoxins
(Figure 1). Astonishingly,
two dietetic samples even exceeded the guidance values for two mycotoxins
simultaneously. Nevertheless, it must be emphasized that cat food
sampling preceded the adoption of the current European Recommendation
concerning DON, ZEA, and OTA contamination in pet food.26

The lack of compliance with European rules
appears particularly critical since this outcome mainly concerned
dietary products aimed at nutritional support for cats affected by
common pathological conditions such as obesity and renal and gastrointestinal
disorders. In fact, such animals might present a suboptimal immunological
status, and prolonged consumption of mycotoxin-contaminated pet food
could be detrimental to their health.2 Dietetic
pet food is poorly investigated in this regard as most of the published
studies on mycotoxin contamination have been carried out on pet food
formulated for healthy dogs and cats (Table 1).

The results from the present monitoring
partially disagreed with those highlighted by our previous similar
study on Italian dry dog food.14 In the
previous work, interesting evidence such as a widespread multicontamination
in most of the samples and differences in the concentration of some
mycotoxins (fumonisins and OTA) based on the price category was obtained.14 Conversely, the present investigation on cat
food showed that a high price does not necessarily guarantee a mycotoxin-free
product.

The mean starch content in standard and premium categories
was similar given the high variability of this complex carbohydrate
among the cat foods evaluated. Furthermore, the correlation study
between the starch content and the concentration of the most prevalent
mycotoxins (total fumonisins, ZEA, and DON) failed to demonstrate
a linear relationship. On the other hand, the five grain-free samples
evaluated, containing starch from legumes and potatoes, showed an
overall low contamination. In most of the other samples, cereals and
cereal byproducts represented the first or second ingredient (or ingredient
category) listed on the label (corn in primis when the type of cereals
was specified). Anyway, information on the exact amount of the different
ingredients was not provided. Consequently, it is only possible to
speculate on the relationship between mycotoxin contamination and
the relatively large quantity of cereals used to produce dry pet food.

Mold growth and mycotoxin production strongly depend on several
factors along the cereal supply chain, such as weather and storage
conditions (i.e., temperature and humidity), microbial and insect
damages, and mechanical injuries.28,29 This situation
partially explains the difficulties in the prediction and control
of the problem as well as the heterogeneous levels of contamination
emerging from the comparison of the results described by the different
studies conducted on pet food published in recent years (Table 1).

In the present
study, in accordance with our previous investigation on dry dog food14 and other similar investigations,8,12,16,17 a widespread occurrence of the most important Fusarium mycotoxins (DON, fumonisins, and, to a lesser extent, ZEA) was observed.

These toxic molecules are commonly found in cereals (corn, in primis)
and in compound feeds (typically containing different grains).30 Furthermore, DON, ZEA, and in particular fumonisins
are particularly heat-stable, and only temperatures above 150 °C
have demonstrated a significant reduction of their toxicity.31 Consequently, these toxins are a matter of great
concern for the pet food industry (particularly fumonisins) since
extrusion typically provides lower temperatures.

According
to previous investigations, the situation concerning aflatoxin occurrence
in pet food is widely heterogeneous (Table 1). Surprisingly, our study revealed a non-negligible
presence of AFB1 in the cat foods evaluated, with three
samples exceeding the European regulatory limit established for animal
feeds including pet food.20

Several
outbreaks of canine aflatoxicosis are reported in the literature.32−34 Conversely, to our knowledge, no case involving cats has been described.
Anyway, aflatoxins represent a common cause of pet food recalls.35 Given the absence of critical control points
for aflatoxins along the manufacturing process (due to their stability
to the extrusion process), routine screening for these contaminants
in cereal ingredients (especially corn and corn byproducts) is necessary.36 Furthermore, even if lower levels of AFB1 than 20 μg/kg have previously shown to be insufficient
for causing noticeable clinical signs in companion animals, the chronic
exposure should not be ignored.2 Surely,
the situation concerning AFB1 as indicated in the present
study represents an important warning sign and suggests for rigorous
screening tests on incoming raw ingredients.

OTA contamination
was very limited even if one of the two positive standard samples
contained a level above the current European guidance value recently
established for companion animals.26 OTA
represents a nephrotoxic compound usually detected not only in several
agricultural commodities such as corn, wheat, and barley but also
in animal-derived products (in particular, meat and milk) given its
high fat solubility and the consequent accumulation in animal tissues,
particularly in swines.18 For this reason,
OTA could be detected both in dry and wet pet food since the latter
product typically contains large amounts of animal-derived ingredients
such as muscles and offal.37 Different
levels of contamination have been reported by several studies carried
out both in Europe and in African countries (Table 1). Interestingly, a recent retrospective
study by Meucci et al.38 evaluating the
blood concentration of OTA in healthy and nephropathic dogs showed
a higher incidence of OTA positivity in this last group. In this regard,
other authors had previously pointed out this mycotoxin etiology in
canine renal failure syndrome.39 Certainly,
these results contribute to supporting the need for rigorous monitoring
by the pet food industry regarding OTA.

According to toxicological
studies, T-2 represents the most toxic compound among trichothecenes.
Given the rapid in vivo conversion of T-2 to HT-2, in vivo toxicity
of T-2 is recognized to include that of HT-2.31 According to a recent EFSA opinion, cats are extremely sensitive
to this mycotoxin category,40 and probably
for this reason, some years ago, the European legislation was implemented
with a guidance value for T-2 + HT-2 only referred to this last species.25 Recently, some studies have reported a wide
occurrence of T-2 and HT-2 in cereals and animal feed.28,29 In regard to pet food, only a few studies have evaluated the occurrence
of these mycotoxins, and they reported conflicting results.12,16 In the present monitoring, probably because of the corresponding
relatively high LODs and LOQs, few positive samples were identified
among which a dietetic product did not comply with the current legislation.26

The present study confirmed the noteworthy
problem of the co-occurrence of different mycotoxins, previously reported
by other surveys on pet food (Table 1) as well as on feed raw materials and feedingstuffs.28,29 Certainly, the detection of one single mycotoxin in a feed sample
represents the exception, and it is well-known that both humans and
animals are usually exposed to several mycotoxins (mainly at low levels)
at the same time.27 Nevertheless, worldwide
regulations and past toxicological studies usually refer to individual
mycotoxins. Recently, an increasing number of investigations evaluating
the toxicological effects of different mycotoxin combinations have
been published, both in vivo41 and in vitro
conditions,27 even if the experimental
doses were usually higher than those found in “natural”
contaminations and often exceeding the international regulatory limits.42 In the present study, one of the most common
co-occurrence was ZEA + DON + fumonisins, with these mycotoxins being
the most frequent in the samples evaluated. In this regard, several Fusarium strains producing ZEA also produce trichothecenes
such as DON, and in general, a frequent co-occurrence of ZEA with
other Fusarium toxins has been described in cereals,
especially in corn.43 Furthermore, a synergy
among these Fusarium toxins has been recognized42 even though additive, synergistic, and antagonistic
effects have been described under in vitro conditions, often depending
on the dose of the toxins.27

Pets
are traditionally fed with the same type of diet for long periods
of their life. Therefore, the scientific community should be aware
of the potential chronic exposure of dogs and cats to relatively low
levels of different mycotoxins and the consequential detrimental risks
to their health.

The results from the present study showed that
mycotoxin contamination represents a critical point for pet food safety.
Certainly, given the high stability of mycotoxins through the cooking
process used to produce dry pet food,5 scrupulous
monitoring of incoming ingredients undoubtedly represents the most
effective strategy to prevent mycotoxin contamination.

Materials and
Methods
Sampling
In order to evaluate a representative selection
of the different types of cat food available on the Italian market,
64 complete commercial dry products of different brands were collected
from stores in the province of Bologna (Italy) from June to September
2015. Specifically, they included 30 standard cat foods (5 for kittens,
5 for senior, and 20 for adult cats) and 34 premium cat foods (5 for
kittens, 5 for senior cats, 5 grain-free, and 19 dietetic products
including 6 for obesity management, 7 for renal diseases, and 6 for
gastrointestinal disorders). Standard samples consisted of products
ranging in price from 0.80 to 4.00 €/kg that were sold by discount
and mass-market retailers. Conversely, premium samples consisted of
more costly diets ranging from 4.00 to 15.00 €/kg that were
purchased in specialized pet stores. The size of the packages ranged
from 250 g to 2 kg. In grain-free samples, the main sources of starch
declared on the label were legumes (lentils, peas, chickpeas, and
beans) and potatoes. The main cereals and cereal by-products listed
on the package of the other cat foods were corn, wheat, rice, corn
gluten, wheat gluten, corn starch, barley, spelt, and yellow millet.
In particular, corn and corn byproducts (corn starch and corn gluten)
represented the most common vegetable ingredients placed in the first
positions of the ingredient list declared on cat food labels.

All of the cat foods were stored in a cool, dry place inside their
original hermetically sealed package until chemical analysis. With
the aim of obtaining a representative sample of each cat food, approximately
half of the content of each product was randomly taken from the original
package (from four different sites), finely ground, stored at −20
°C, and analyzed within its shelf life.

Nutrient Analyses
The cat food samples were chemically analyzed to determine the moisture
and starch content according to the official methods of the Association
of Official Analytical Chemists (method 950.46 for moisture and method
996.11 for starch).44

Determination
of Mycotoxin Concentration
The most important mycotoxins
currently regulated in the EU regarding pet food have been evaluated
in cat food samples.

Chemicals and Reagents
Aflatoxin
B1 (AFB1), aflatoxin B2 (AFB2), aflatoxin G1 (AFG1), aflatoxin G2 (AFG2), fumonisin B1 (FB1), fumonisin B2 (FB2), deoxynivalenol (DON),
zearalenone (ZEA), ochratoxin A (OTA), T-2 toxin (T-2), and HT-2 toxin
(HT-2) standards were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany).

U-[13C17]-aflatoxin B1 (13C AFB1), U-[13C34]-fumonisin B1 (13C FB1), U-[13C15]-deoxynivalenol
(13C DON), U-[13C18]-zearalenone
(13C ZEA), U-[13C20]-ochratoxin A
(13C OTA), and U-[13C24]-T-2 toxin
(13C T-2) were obtained from Romer Lab Inc. – Biopure
(Tulln, Austria).

Methanol, formic acid, and ammonium acetate,
used as mobile phases, were of LC–MS grade and were purchased
from Riedel-de Haën (Seelze, Germany). Acetonitrile and acetic
acid, used in the extraction procedures, were purchased from Merck
(Darmstadt, Germany).

Reverse osmosis and ultrapure water, respectively
used as an extraction solvent and the mobile phase, were produced
using a human-powered apparatus from Human Co. (Seoul, South Korea).

Sample Preparation
The method set up by Zhang et al.45 was slightly modified and used in this work.
A ground sample (500 mg) was weighed in a beaker, fortified with labeled
standards, and extracted with 5 mL of acetonitrile/water (50:50).
The sample was shaken for 15 min, and 500 μL of the supernatant
was collected and transferred in an Amicon ultra centrifugal filter
(0.5 mL, 3 K; Millipore, Carrigtwohill, Ireland). After a centrifugation
step, 14,000 rpm for 30 min at 20 °C, the sample, once filtered,
was analyzed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography in combination
with tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS/MS). The samples with
a mycotoxin concentration greater than 1,000 μg/kg were diluted
to obtain a correct analyte concentration in the curve range.

UPLC–MS/MS
Equipment and Conditions
Analyses were conducted with a UPLC–MS/MS
system, composed of a Waters Acquity UPLC binary pump, equipped with
a Waters Acquity BEH C18 reversed-phase column (50 ×
2.1 mm, 1.7 μm) coupled to a VanGuard guard column with identical
packaging (Waters, Milford, MA, USA).

Two different mobile phases
were optimized, one for DON and the other for all of the other analytes.

For all the analytes, water containing 0.1% formic acid and methanol
containing 0.1% formic acid were employed as mobile phases under programmed
conditions at a flow rate of 0.42 mL/min. Analyses were carried out
over 16 min using a previous method developed by Jackson et al.46

Some changes about LC and MS conditions
for the DON analysis were necessary to improve the sensitivity of
the determination. For DON, the mobile phase consisted of 5 mM ammonium
acetate (A) and methanol (B), and the flow rate was 0.3 mL/min. The
following gradient program, time (%A–%B), was applied: 0 min
(99–1), 1 min (95–5), 2 min (25–75), 2.1 min
(1–99), 4 min (99–1), 6 min (99–1). For both
methods, the column heater temperature was set at 40 °C, and
the volume injection was 10 μL.

The mass spectrometer
was a Quattro Premier XE, a triple quadrupole instrument equipped
with an ESCI multimode ionization source (Waters, Milford, MA, USA).

The mass spectrometer was operated in the positive electrospray
ionization mode (ESI+) using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). The
capillary voltage was set at 3.5 kV for all analytes and 3.0 kV for
DON; the MRM transitions, cone voltages, and collision energies are
shown in Table 2.

Data acquisition and processing was performed using Mass Lynx 4.1
Software (Waters Corporation, Milford, USA).

Method Validation
The proposed method was validated in-house according to the European
Commission Decision 2002/657/EC47 and Commission
Regulation 2006/401/EC.48 The following
parameters were evaluated: specificity, linearity, trueness, precision,
limits of quantification (LOQs), and limits of detection (LODs).

One grain-free sample exhibiting no measurable concentrations of
the analytes of interest was used for the validation of the analytical
method.

Fortified samples were obtained adding different volumes
of mycotoxin standard solutions to blank samples before the extraction
steps. Spiked samples were left at least for 2 h at room temperature
to allow for the evaporation of the solvents and the equilibration
between the analytes and matrix.

The matrix-matched calibration
curve (R2 > 0.98) occurred over the
range of 0 to 1000 μg/kg using seven calibration standards (0,
5, 20, 50, 100, 200, and 1000 μg/kg).

The recovery and
precision of the methods were evaluated at three quality control levels
(20, 50, and 100 μg/kg).

The injection of four replicates
of three quality control levels demonstrated satisfying precision,
with maximum relative standard deviations to the mean of 12.2% as
well as good trueness values expressed as the relative bias between
the mean value measured and the spiked concentration, ranging from
−12.1 to 4.5%. The trueness and precision (in terms of repeatability)
values obtained fulfill the performance criteria established by the
abovementioned regulations.47,48 Specificity was assessed
excluding the presence of potential interferences around mycotoxin
retention times in the chromatograms of non-contaminated samples.
Moreover, the blank sample used for the method validation was used
to evaluate the matrix effects, as ion suppression or enhancement;
in particular, it was injected while standard solutions (1 μg/mL)
were directly infused with a flow of 10 μg/min through a T-connection
device into the LC eluate.49 The ion currents
were stable, and no interference was recorded at the specific retention
times of the considered mycotoxins.

Limits of quantification
of the method, defined as the concentrations providing a chromatographic
signal with a signal-to-noise ratio equal to 10, were 3 μg/kg
for FB1, FB2, AFB1, AFB2, AFG1, AFG2, and DON, 5 μg/kg for ZEA
and OTA, 10 μg/kg for T-2, and 20 μg/kg for HT-2. Limits
of detection of the method, defined as the concentrations providing
a chromatographic signal with a signal-to-noise ratio equal to 3 for
the qualification transition, were 1 μg/kg for FB1, FB2, AFB1, AFB2, AFG1, AFG2, and DON, 2 μg/kg for ZEA and OTA, and 5
μg/kg for T-2 and HT-2.

Standard curves and quality controls
were run at the beginning and end of each analytical run day.

Statistical Analyses
The concentrations of the different
mycotoxins in the two price categories of cat foods were statistically
analyzed by using Student’s t test. For samples
in which they were not detected or quantified, a specific mycotoxin
was assigned according to the corresponding LOD or LOQ. The level
of significance was set at P < 0.05. Furthermore,
the correlations between the starch content (expressed on a dry matter
basis) and the concentration of the different mycotoxins were analyzed
using the Pearson correlation test. All of the statistical computations
were performed with Statistica 10.0 (Stat Soft Italia, Italy).
