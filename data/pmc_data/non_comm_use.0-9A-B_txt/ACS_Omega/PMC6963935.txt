A magnetically retrievable ferrocene
appended supported ionic liquid
phase (SILP) photocatalyst containing a molybdate anion has been synthesized
and characterized by Fourier transform infrared, X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction,
energy dispersive spectroscopy, and vibrating sample magnetometer
analysis. The optical properties of the photocatalyst were probed
by photoluminescence and UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy.
The discharge of undesirable dye effluents from textile industrial
plants in the environment is the major concern of environmental pollution
and toxicity. In this context, we employed the as-prepared SILP photocatalyst
for degradation of methyl orange (MO) under UV light (365 nm) irradiation,
and subsequently, recycling studies were performed. The histological
alteration in gills of the fish is employed as a tool for monitoring
toxins in the environment. In view of this, the histo-toxicological
assessment on freshwater fish Tilapia mossambica gills asserted the damage of secondary gill lamellae due to MO.
Conversely, structural modifications in the gill architecture were
not observed by virtue of photodegraded products confirming that the
degraded product is nontoxic in nature. Additionally, the normal behavior
of fishes on exposure to photodegraded products reveals that research
findings are beneficial for the aquatic ecosystem.

1 Introduction
The environmental pollution
has become a prominent issue with a
detrimental influence on human
life. Industries such as textile, dye manufacturing, plastic, rubber,
and cosmetics release nonbiodegradable, toxic, and carcinogenic dyes
in the nearest water bodies, which provoke environmental pollution
causing perilous consequences to human health and aquatic biota.1−4 The discharge of synthetic dyes containing wastewater leads to generation
of dangerous by-products through the chemical processes like oxidation,
hydrolysis, or other reactions.5 Consequently,
the development of efficient processes for removal of dyes from wastewater
has gained a great deal of attention. Among the various processes,
photocatalysis is a promising tool of dye degradation.6 The design of robust and efficient photocatalytic systems
is highly demanded, and efforts have been concerned on applications
of metal oxide, sulfide, or nitride based semiconductors and nanomaterials
for removal of pollutants.7−23 Moreover, the Fenton process is a propitious way of advanced oxidation
processes employed for wastewater treatment. However, the addition
of a ferrous salt during the course of dye degradation limits the
applicability of the traditional Fenton process. In addition, separation
of the catalyst becomes a tedious task as it turns into iron sludge
accumulation, which contributes to secondary pollution.24 In order to circumvent these issues, the development
of Fenton mimicking heterogeneous processes is the subject of vivid
interest in environmental remediation research. Ferrocene is a highly
stable, nontoxic, organometallic compound with high catalytic potential
due to the electron donor–acceptor conjugated structure serving
as a redox switch. Tian et al. reported the applicability of ferrocene
in dye degradation.25,26 Recently, the efforts have been
focused on designing a heterogeneous version of the Fenton system
by immobilization of ferrocene on SBA-15,27 MCM-41,28 silica,29 and SWCNTs.30

The implementation
of green chemistry principles is becoming a
central issue in the 21st century. The chemical industry is adopting
more sustainable technologies, which is possible through developing
the eco-friendly processes for reducing waste and also preventing
the toxicity in the environment.31 In this
regard, generous interest has been sparked in supported ionic liquid
phase (SILP) catalysis involving grafting of ionic liquid like units
onto a porous material with high surface area.32 A highly striking stratagem is offered by these advanced
materials to overcome the demerits of ionic liquids and opens up a
new avenue of powerful green tools for recognizing the goal of sustainable
chemical processes.33,34 The motive for designing SILP
catalysts instigates from their tempting properties such as facile
separation, selectivity, recycling, reproducibility, and activity.
Moreover, the processes employing SILP catalysts can be carried out
in continuous fixed bed reactors.35 In
the last few years, the field of SILP catalysis has witnessed substantial
progress allowing chemical transformations under environmentally benign
conditions.36−38

In the past few years, the applicability of
magnetic nanoparticles
(MNPs) has received significant attention due to their broad applications
in the chemical industry.39−41 Amidst them, exploitation of
Fe3O4 MNPs in developing magnetically separable
catalysts has originated as a frontier horizon that empowers greener
and sustainable chemical transformations.42 The low toxicity, easy retrievability by external magnet and high
surface area of Fe3O4 MNPs have made them as
excellent support materials in the preparation of SILP catalysts.43 Furthermore, in tailoring task specific catalytic
systems, ease of surface functionalization of Fe3O4 MNPs with desired substituents has incorporated noteworthy
versatility for these materials.44 Owing
to these features, a large number of Fe3O4 MNP
SILP catalysts have been designed and successfully prepared for catalyzing
important organic transformations. However, despite substantial progress,
application of Fe3O4 MNP SILP catalysts in photocatalysis
is still unexplored and therefore warrants immediate attention.

In view of prior discussion and in continuance of our research
associated with green chemistry,45,46 in the present
investigation, the advantages of materials that mentioned above are
united. This study aims to establish a new heterogeneous ferrocene
based Fenton system. We succeeded in preparing a new magnetically
retrievable ferrocene appended supported ionic liquid phase photocatalyst
containing a molybdate anion, which was reaffirmed by various analyses.
The photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange (MO) under UV radiation
(365 nm) was investigated in the presence of the as-prepared material
as an effective photocatalyst. It is found that incorporation of the
ferrocenyl moiety and molybdate anion play a vital role in photocatalysis.
On the other hand, MNPs act as magnetic seeds that aid in the separation
and reusability of the photocatalyst. The degradation percentage of
MO as a pollutant was calculated about 99% within 30 min. Another
aim of this study was the histo-toxicological assessment of photodegraded
products on the gills of freshwater fish Tilapia mossambica. The normal behavior of fishes and no alterations in the gill architecture
confirmed the nontoxic nature of photodegraded products.

2 Results and Discussion
The preparative route for the magnetically
retrievable ferrocene
appended supported ionic liquid phase photocatalyst is outlined in Scheme 1. Initially, the
chemical coprecipitation method was employed for preparation of Fe3O4 MNPs abbreviated as Mag. (1). Subsequently,
the silica layer was coated by the sol–gel process using tetraethyl
orthosilicate (TEOS (2)) to afford (SiO2@Mag, 3). The synthesis of 3-chloropropyl modified Fe3O4 MNP (3-Cl.Pr.SiO2@Mag, 5) with
efficient organofunctionalization was achieved by taking advantage
of the distinctive capacity of Si–OH groups on the surface
of 3 to produce strong Si–O–Si bonds with
alkoxysilane groups of 3-chloropropyl triethoxysilane (4). The ionic liquid mimicking unit was incorporated in 5 with the aid of the chloropropyl group via quaternization of 1-N-ferrocenylmethyl benzimidazole (6) to give
the azolium salt acronymed as [FemIL@SiO2@Mag]Cl (7). Afterward, 7 by the anion metathesis reaction
with sodium molybdate (8) afforded a magnetically retrievable
ferrocene appended supported ionic liquid phase photocatalyst containing
a molybdate anion abbreviated as [FemIL@SiO2@Mag]2MoO4 (9).

Scheme 1 Preparation of [FemIL@SiO2@Mag]2MoO4 (9)
The surface modifications on pristine Mag. (1) associated
with preparation [FemIL@SiO2@Mag]2MoO4 (9) were monitored by FT-IR spectroscopy (Figure 1). The stretching
vibration band of Fe–O was observed at 592 cm–1 in the FT-IR spectrum of unmodified Mag. (1).47 The peaks in the FT-IR spectrum at 1060, 957,
and 794 cm–1 approved the successful coating of
the silica layer on 1, which are ascribed to asymmetric
Si–O–Si, symmetric Si–O, and symmetric Si–O–Si
stretching modes, respectively.48 The characteristic
peak displayed at 2942 cm–1 in the FT-IR spectrum
of 3-Cl.Pr.SiO2@Mag (5) is ascribed to the
C–H stretching modes of the propyl group.49 In the FT-IR spectrum of [FemIL@SiO2@Mag]Cl
(7), the strong bands observed at 472 (Fe-Cp stretching),
1564 (C=C stretching), and 1635 (C=N stretching) suggesting covalent
anchoring of 1-N-ferrocenylmethyl benzimidazole (6) on 5. Moreover, the stretching vibration of
aromatic C–H in benzimidazole and ferrocene groups is displayed
at 3018 cm–1.47,50 In the FT-IR spectrum
of [FemIL@SiO2@Mag]2MoO4 (9), the absorption peaks observed at 890 and 959 cm–1 are ascribed to Mo–O stretching confirmed the successful
immobilization of the molybdate anion [MoO4]2– on 9.51

The loading of the molybdate anion in [FemIL@SiO2@Mag]2MoO4 (9) was probed by energy-dispersive
X-ray (EDX) analysis, which affirmed 0.21 mmol of molybdate anion
per gram of 9.

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
was employed to study the thermal
profile of [FemIL@SiO2@Mag]2MoO4 (9) at a 10 °C/min heating rate in air within the 25–1000
°C temperature range (Figure 2). Initially, a weight loss of 1.99% centered at 105
°C was observed in the thermogram attributed to desorption of
physisorbed water. Moreover, a steep weight loss of 33.91% up to 340
°C as well as cramped weight losses of 14.99% at 450 °C
and 21.78% at 615 °C was due to thermal degradation of covalently
bonded organic scaffolds. The large residual weight is ascribed to
generation of thermostable metallic oxides and silica.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and field emission
scanning
electron microscopy (FE-SEM) were employed to investigate the size,
shape, and morphology of prepared samples as displayed in Figures 3 and 4. The SEM images of different magnetic nanoparticles in this
work (SiO2@Mag (3), [FemIL@SiO2@Mag]Cl (7), and [FemIL@SiO2@Mag]2MoO4 (9)) displayed that the particles are
mostly spherical with average sizes of 27 (3), 34 (7), and 35 nm (9). Moreover, SEM images clearly
indicate that the sizes of particles changes very slightly after organofunctionalization.
So, the influence of surface modification on particle size was found
to be negligible.

[FemIL@SiO2@Mag]Cl (7), and (c) [FemIL@SiO2@Mag]2MoO4 (9).

Figure 4 TEM images of (a–d) [FemIL@SiO2@Mag]2MoO4 (9) with SAED patterns.

The TEM micrographs of [FemIL@SiO2@Mag]2MoO4 (9) present spherically shaped granules
with
a nonsmooth surface (Figure 4a–c). In addition, TEM micrographs display a dark Fe3O4 nanocore encapsulated with a gray shell indicating
surface functionalization.43 A bright dotted
pattern demonstrated by selected area electron diffraction (SAED)
confirmed that the nature of Fe3O4 MNP was single
crystalline (Figure 4d), which is in well agreement with X-ray diffraction analysis.

The preservation of the crystalline nature of Fe3O4 MNPs in [FemIL@SiO2@Mag]2MoO4 (9) was affirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The XRD
patterns of SiO2@Mag (3), 3-Cl.Pr.SiO2@Mag (5), [FemIL@SiO2@Mag]Cl (7), and [FemIL@SiO2@Mag]2MoO4 (9) are shown in Figure 5. The position and relative intensities of all peaks
in diffractograms of all the samples coincide with JCPDS card no.
86-1339, confirming the structural preservation of the Fe3O4 nanocore as single phase inverse spinel with crystallinity
and high phase purity. All four samples demonstrate diffraction peaks
at 2θ values of 30.19, 35.48, 43.12, 57.10, 62.67, and 75.03°
assigned to the (2 2 0), (3 1 1), (4 0 0), (5 1 1), (4 4 0), and (6
2 2) crystal planes of Fe3O4, respectively.
The sharp and highly intense peak at a 2θ value of 35.48°
was assigned to the (3 1 1) plane. With respect to the sharp and highly
intense peak, the average crystallite size for 9 was
found to be 47 nm according to the Debye–Scherrer equation.
Gratifyingly, the multistep functionalization process on the surface
of Mag. (1) did not induce any phase alteration.

The structural modifications
due to functionalization of Mag. (1) were investigated
by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).
The peaks for Mo, C, O, N, Fe, and Si were observed in the survey
spectrum of [FemIL@SiO2@Mag]2MoO4 (9) (Figure 6). The peaks at 235.7 (2p3/2) and 232.4 eV (2p1/2) displayed in the core-level XPS spectrum of Mo 3d confirmed
the existence Mo in 9 with a +6 oxidation state (Figure 6b).52 The photoelectron peak in the C 1s region displayed at
283.1 eV is deconvoluted into peaks at 286.4, 285.0, 284.2, and 283.0
eV (Figure 6c). The
peak at 283.0 eV signifies bonding interactions of silicon and carbon.
Moreover, the photoelectron peak in the Si 2p region at 100.0 eV is
evident to support this fact (Figure 6g).53 The peaks detected
in the C1s XPS spectra were assigned to ferrocenyl carbons (284.2
eV), sp3 C carbon (285.0 eV), and carbon bonded with quaternized
nitrogen (286.4 eV).54,55 Dong and co-workers reported
that, in the XPS spectrum of Fe, the shifting of core-level peaks
toward higher binding energy is observed in the ferrocene anchored
material as compared to ferrocene. The successful grafting of the
ferrocene moiety is evident from photoelectron peaks of Fe 2p at 723.0
and 708.7 eV (Figure 6f).56 In the N 1s XPS spectrum, two distinct
peaks at 398.7 and 401.2 eV were perceived. The photoelectron peak
at 401.2 eV is ascribed to wingtip nitrogen in the benzimidazolium
cation ring (Figure 6d).57 The peaks observed in the O 1s XPS
spectrum reflects oxygen in Fe3O4 MNPs (528.1
eV) and oxygen bonded with Si (530.5 eV) (Figure 6e).58 Thus, successful
formation of 9 is corroborated by these structural investigations.

A magnetic vibrating
sample magnetometer (VSM) was employed to
scrutinize the magnetic characteristics of bare Mag. (1) and [FemIL@SiO2@Mag]2MoO4 (9). The hysteresis loops of samples at room temperature are
depicted in Figure 7. The bare Mag. (1) and 9 illustrate magnetization
saturation (Ms) values of 44 and 14 emu/g, respectively.
Conversely, a decrease in saturation magnetization was observed after
multistep functionalization of 1.59 This lowering of Ms stems from quenching
of surface magnetic moments in 9 due to nonmagnetic groups
on the surface of 1.However, Ms illustrated
by 9 was sufficient enough such that 9 was
effectively retrieved with the aid of an external magnet.

2.1 UV–Visible
Diffuse Reflectance Spectra
The optical properties of Mag.
(1), SiO2@Mag (3), 3-Cl.Pr.SiO2@Mag (5), [FemIL@SiO2@Mag]Cl (7), and [FemIL@SiO2@Mag]2MoO4 (9) were studied
by UV–visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and are displayed
in Figure 8. The spectra
indicate different absorption edges for Mag. (1), SiO2@Mag (3), 3-Cl.Pr.SiO2@Mag (5), [FemIL@SiO2@Mag]Cl (7), and [FemIL@SiO2@Mag]2MoO4 (9). The studies
reveal that all the samples (1, 3, 5, 7, and 9) exhibit absorption
in the visible region plausibly owing to the presence of Fe3O4 MNPs. In addition, the optical band gap values of Mag.
(1), SiO2@Mag (3), 3-Cl.Pr.SiO2@Mag (5), [FemIL@SiO2@Mag]Cl (7), and [FemIL@SiO2@Mag]2MoO4 (9) were obtained by the Tauc plot ((αhυ)2 vs hυ) from
the UV–visible spectra using the following equation (Figure 8).60 1  where n is
equal to 0.5 for the allowed direct transition, h is Planck’s constant, A is the proportionality
constant, α is the absorption coefficient, υ is light
frequency, and Eg is the band gap energy.

The band gap of pristine Mag.
(1) was found to be
2.1 eV and is in well harmony with the literature.61 The band gaps of Mag. (1), SiO2@Mag (3), 3-Cl.Pr.SiO2@Mag (5), [FemIL@SiO2@Mag]Cl (7), and [FemIL@SiO2@Mag]2MoO4 (9) are 2.1,
2.26, 2.39, 2.09, and 2.31 eV, respectively (Figure 9). These studies reveal significantly a higher
band gap of 9 than 7. The increase in the
band gap and decrease in absorption intensity of 9 can
be ascribed to the existence of the molybdate anion [MoO4]2– in [FemIL@SiO2@Mag]2MoO4 (9), which subsequently leads to the decrease
in the rate of electron–hole pair recombination.

2.2 Photoluminescence Spectra
The degree
of transfer, migration, and reunion rate of photogenerated electron–hole
pairs in Mag. (1), SiO2@Mag (3), 3-Cl.Pr.SiO2@Mag (5), [FemIL@SiO2@Mag]Cl (7), and [FemIL@SiO2@Mag]2MoO4 (9) were investigated by photoluminescence
(PL) spectral analysis.

The PL spectra were recorded with an
excitation wavelength of 292 nm at ambient temperature (Figure 10). The appearances
of comparatively strong emission bands at 580 (3-Cl.Pr.SiO2@Mag (5)), 583 (SiO2@Mag (3)),
584 (Mag. (1)), and 579 nm ([FemIL@SiO2@Mag]Cl
(7)) indicate rapid reunion rates of the photoinduced
electron–hole pairs. It is noteworthy that the presence of
[MoO4]2– in [FemIL@SiO2@Mag]2MoO4 (9) causes a significant lowering
of the PL intensity compared to [FemIL@SiO2@Mag]Cl (7). This is accounted to the improved electron–hole
pair separation. On account of this, [FemIL@SiO2@Mag]2MoO4 (9) is envisioned to show excellent
photocatalytic activity toward degradation of MO.

2.3 Photocatalytic Activity
The photocatalytic
activity, kinetics of reaction, and adsorption ability of [FemIL@SiO2@Mag]2MoO4 (9) were tested
for a model pollutant MO degradation under UV-light irradiation (365
nm). UV–visible spectra were used to determine concentrations
of the dye at a wavelength of maximum absorbance (464 nm for MO).
A mathematical relation for degradation (D%), final
concentration (C), and initial concentration (Co) is 2  

The photocatalytic
reaction was found to fit with a pseudo-first-order. The corresponding
slope of the fitting line presents the value of the rate constant k (min–1). 3  

The photocatalytic
performances of as-prepared samples were tested
for MO degradation under irradiation of UV light. Initial efforts
were focused on optimization of loading of the [FemIL@SiO2@Mag]2MoO4 (9) for MO photodegradation.
Accordingly, various quantities of 9 were employed (Figure 11). Use of 0.5 g/dm39 resulted in 45% MO photodegradation efficiency.
Increasing catalyst loading from 0.5 to 0.75 g/dm3 to 1.0
g/dm3 enhanced the photodegradation efficiency to 75%.
The increase in degradation efficiency can be rationalized on the
basis of the increase in the number of active sites that significantly
increase the interaction between both light and MO molecules. However,
increasing the catalyst quantity beyond 1.0 g/dm3 had a
negative impact as the photodegradation efficiency dropped to 57%.
This is attributed to the agglomeration of 9 due to which
the surface becomes unavailable for photon absorption. In addition,
turbidity of the suspension leads to diminution in the penetration
of UV light, thereby decreasing the photodegradation efficiency. It
is noteworthy to mention that, in the absence of 9, negligible
degradation of MO was observed indicating the decisive role of 9 in the photodegradation process. Further, no shift in the
λmax of MO reveals that the course of photodegradation
proceeds without generation of toxic intermediates (Figure 12).62 The photocatalytic reaction was found to fit with a pseudo-first-order
along with rate constants (k) of 3.124 × 10–3, 3.219 × 10–3, 7.997 ×
10–3, and 6.66 × 10–3 min–1 for 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, and 1.5 g/dm3, respectively
(Figure 13).

The use of H2O2 is crucial in dye degradation
as it leads to the generation of hydroxyl radicals that assist in
the dye degradation. In view of this, we decided to probe the effect
of H2O2. Accordingly, [FemIL@SiO2@Mag]2MoO4 (9) assisted photodegradation
of MO was carried out using various concentrations of H2O2 (Figure 14). The results revealed that increasing the H2O2 concentration from 2 to 10 mmol/dm3 significantly
enhances the MO photodegradation efficiency from 76 to 99% with substantial
reduction in photodegradation time to 30 min (Figure 15).

Figure 15 UV–visible spectral changes for photodegradation of MO in
the presence of [FemIL@SiO2@Mag]2MoO4 (9) under the optimized conditions.

We also investigated the photocatalytic activities of SiO2@Mag (3), 3-Cl.Pr.SiO2@Mag (5), and [FemIL@SiO2@Mag]Cl (7) keeping
all
the parameters identical (Figure 16). Considerable MO photodegradation was not observed
using SiO2@Mag (3) and 3-Cl.Pr.SiO2@Mag (5) in photocatalytic experiments. However, [FemIL@SiO2@Mag]Cl (7) displayed 43% photocatalytic activity,
which is due to its lower band gap, as compared to [FemIL@SiO2@Mag]2MoO4 (9) that results
in a higher recombination rate of photogenerated electron–hole
pairs.

2.4 Plausible Mechanism for [FemIL@SiO2@Mag]2MoO4 (9) Assisted Photodegradation
of MO
A tentative mechanistic rational for [FemIL@SiO2@Mag]2MoO4 (9) assisted
photodegradation of MO under UV light is shown in reactions 4–7 on the basis of the literature.63 In
the UV light irradiation, excitation of the electron from the valence
band (VB) to conduction band (CB) of 9 occurs leading
to the generation of the electron and hole in the VB and CB, respectively
(reaction 4). The electrons
transferred in the CB react with H2O2 molecules
to form oxidative species ·OH radicals (reaction 5). Furthermore, photoinduced
holes left in VB accept electrons from the hydroxyl group forming
highly oxidative ·OH radicals (reaction 6), which are responsible for degradation of
MO dye molecules (reaction 7) (Figure 17). 4   5   6   7  

Figure 17 Schematic model for mechanism of catalyst performance.

Additionally, the appended ferrrocenyl group plays
a crucial role
in photodegradation of MO because it, along with H2O2, forms Fenton catalyst mimic species. Ferrocene is reversibly oxidized; initially, it reacts with H2O2 where it is oxidized forming the ferrocinium
cation and ·OH radical and then regenerated back by
transfer of the electron from H2O2 to ferrocinium
cation producing HO2. Both ·OH and HO2· are key oxidative species, which are primarily
responsible for MO photodegradation (reactions 8–9).64 8   9  

The recyclability of the catalyst
is crucial concerning green chemistry
and economical perspectives. MO photodegradation under the optimized
reaction conditions was performed to study reusability of [FemIL@SiO2@Mag]2MoO4 (9). After each
cycle, 9 was retrieved magnetically, washed with deionized
water, dried at 50 °C in vacuo, and employed directly for another
consecutive cycle. The photocatalyst exhibited remarkable recyclability
as the photodegradation efficiency of 9 was maintained
in the range of 99–93% up to six consecutive cycles (Figure 18).

2.5 Histo-Toxicity
Assessment of MO and Photodegraded
Products on T. mossambica
Gills play a vital role in the fish body as a respiratory organ.
A layer of thin epithelial cells is covered on fish gills, which facilitate
discharge of nitrogenous waste, control of acid–base, ionic
balance, and exchange of gases.65 The large
surface area of gills is sensitive to physical and chemical modifications
in aquatic environments. Consequently, histological alteration in
gills of the fish is employed as a tool for monitoring toxins in the
environment.66 In view of this, we investigated
histo-toxicity assessment of MO and photodegraded products on gills
of T. mossambica. It was observed that
fishes exposed to MO solution showed striking behavioral changes such
as restlessness and rapid movement followed by loss of balance and
erratic swimming to near water surfaces. However, the fishes exposed
to photodegraded MO products displayed normal behavior, which was
similar to the control group of fishes.

The histological markers
are proven to be useful in assessing toxicity of various compounds
including dyes.67−69 Therefore, the histopathological examination of gills
was performed to assess toxicity of MO and its photodegraded products.
In the control group of fishes, the gill showed characteristic histological
features like blood vessels (BV), supporting cartilaginous rod (SCR),
primary gill lamella (PGL), and overall normal architecture (Figure 19A). However, fishes
exposed directly to MO solution showed deformations in the gill architecture
such as fusion of secondary gill lamellae (FSGL), desquamation (DSQ),
breakdown of pillar cells (BPC), curling of secondary lamellae (CSL),
epithelial lifting (EL), and telangiensis (TL). Moreover, the decrease
in the gill size was noticed due to shrinkage of the supporting cartilaginous
rod (SSCR). Additionally, intracellular vacuolation, severe degeneration
(DEG), and necrosis epithelium resulted in gill disruption (Figure 19B). On the contrary,
the fishes exposed to photodegraded MO products revealed a normal
gill architecture similar to control fishes (Figure 19C). These investigations reveal that the
photodegraded MO products are nontoxic.

In continuation with the
attainment of this work, the scope of
[FemIL@SiO2@Mag]2MoO4 (9) could be furthermore expanded by evaluating its photocatalytic
performance toward mixed proportions of various dyes as well as industrial
effluents. Additionally, histo-toxicological assessment of photodegraded
products on other aquatic animals may open avenue for applicability
of this protocol realizing its environmental fate. Considering these
aspects, the work is currently underway in our laboratory.

3 Conclusions
We have successfully prepared a magnetically
retrievable ferrocene
appended supported ionic liquid phase (SILP) photocatalyst containing
a molybdate anion. The photocatalytic potential of the as-prepared
SILP photocatalyst demonstrated that the percentage of MO degradation
in the presence of H2O2 was up to 99% after
UV light irradiation (365 nm) for 30 min. The reusability studies
revealed that the photocatalyst could be efficiently recycled for
six consecutive runs without substantial loss in activity. These results
implying that the as-prepared SILP photocatalyst is a promising material
with remarkable potential to be employed for photocatalytic applications
under UV light. The presence of the molybdate anion in the SILP photocatalyst
was found to be responsible for the lowering of PL intensity improving
electron–hole pair separation. As a result, immobilization
of the molybdate anion facilitated enhancement in overall photocatalytic
performance of the SILP catalyst as compared to its precursor. The
fishes exposed to photodegraded MO products displayed normal behavior,
which was similar to the control group of T. mossambica fishes. The histo-toxicological assessment on the T. mossambica gills asserted the damage to secondary
gill lamellae due to MO. On the contrary, structural modifications
in the gill architecture were not observed by virtue of photodegraded
products confirming their nontoxic nature. The use of SILP as a photocatalyst
for the removal of MO in water affords a significant insight toward
dye containing wastewater treatment. In view of green chemistry, this
protocol offers precious advantages such as excellent photodegradation
efficiency, hassle-free magnetic isolation, recyclability, and nontoxic
nature of photodegraded products.

employed. Typically, 2.0 g of FeCl2·4H2O, 5.2 g of FeCl3·6H2O, and 0.85 mL of
HCl (12 mol/L) were dissolved in 25 mL of deionized water to prepare
a stock solution. Then the stock solution was added in a dropwise
manner to a beaker containing 250 mL solution of NaOH (1.5 mol L–1) with vigorous stirring in a nitrogen atmosphere
maintaining temperature at 80 °C. Afterward, the precipitate
of Fe3O4 MNPs was separated magnetically followed

The
magnetic Fe3O4 NPs were coated
with silica by using the sol–gel technique. In 40 mL of absolute
ethanol, a suspension of 0.9 g of Mag. (1) was prepared
and subjected to ultrasonication for 0.5 h. Subsequently, 14 mL of
TEOS solution (2) (0.2 mL of TEOS in 13.8 mL of absolute

(0.12 mol, 23.25 g) with constant stirring. After refluxing for 5
h, the reaction mixture was cooled and water (125 mL) was added with
stirring. The residue was isolated by filtration and subsequently
washed with dilute acetic acid and water. The sodium hydroxide solution
(50%) was used to make the filtrate alkaline while maintaining cooling
in an ice bath. Finally, the resultant mixture was extracted thrice
with ether. The washing of the collected organic extract with water
was performed. Anhydrous Na2SO4 was employed

Benzimidazole (6)
A mixture of ferrocenylmethyl
trimethyl ammonium iodide (2 g) and benzimidazole (6.5 mmol, 0.766

per gram of 9.

4.10 Catalytic Test of [FemIL@SiO2@Mag]2MoO4 (9)
The photocatalytic
activities of as-synthesized samples were tested using MO photodegradation
under UV light (365 nm) using a high pressure Hg lamp (HPL-N) Philips
250 W. The provision to get enough oxygen for the photochemical reaction
was made by keeping the photoreactor open in air. For the photocatalytic
experiments in a photoreactor containing 100 mL of aqueous dye solution
(MO = 20 ppm), the various amounts of [FemIL@SiO2@Mag]2MoO4 (9) from 0.5 to 1.5 g/dm3 were dispersed. To ensure adsorption equilibrium, before
UV irradiation, the suspensions were stirred in the dark (30 min).
Irradiated aliquots (3 mL) were taken periodically at specific time
intervals. The dispersed photocatalyst was magnetically retrieved.
The residual MO concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance
of the dye at 464 nm employing a UV–vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu,
model-UV-3600) during the photocatalytic degradation process. 1 g/dm3 [FemIL@SiO2@Mag]2MoO4 (9) was elected as the optimum quantity. The effect of H2O2 concentration of 2–10 mmol/dm3 was investigated keeping other parameters identical. The optimum
concentration of H2O2 was found to be 10 mmol/dm3. Further, the catalytic tests of SiO2@Mag (3), 3-Cl.Pr.SiO2@Mag (5), and [FemIL@SiO2@Mag]Cl (7) were also performed under optimized
conditions. To study the recyclability of 9, the model
photochemical reaction was performed for photodegradation of MO and 9 was separated magnetically followed by washings with deionized
water. The dried photocatalyst was again dispersed in dye solution
for consecutive cycles.

4.11 Histo-Toxicological Assessment
of Dye on T. mossambica Gills
Histo-toxicity of MO
(20 ppm) and subsequent photodegraded products was tested on the gills
of T. mossambica obtained from Kalamba
Lake, Kolhapur, Maharashtra, India. Initially, fishes were adapted
in a tank of glass containing tap water (26 ± 2 °C, pH =
6.7 ± 0.2) for 12 days. Further, the experiment was performed
in glass tanks of 10 dm3 capacity. Three fingerlings per
tank with 6.53 ± 1.5 cm body length and 5.6 ± 1.2 g weight
were used for histo-toxicity studies. Three experimental groups were
set: one control group containing tap water and two treatment groups
containing MO (20 ppm) and photodegraded products in tap water. Toxicity
was tested for 48 h with a photoperiod of 12 h. Fingerlings were fed
once a day with commercial fish feed.

Finally, fishes were sacrificed
to remove gills for histological investigations. NBF (neutral buffered
formalin) was employed to fix gill tissue for 24 h followed by washing
with tap water. Further, tissues were dehydrated in grades of alcohols,
cleared in xylene, and embedded in wax blocks for sectioning. Paraffin
wax blocks were sectioned with a rotary microtome to obtain 5 micron
thick sections. The sections were processed for rehydration and dehydration
and cleared in xylene. Eosin–hematoxylin was used to stain
the sections, which were subsequently, mounted within DPX. Slides
were then examined using a light microscope (Lawrence and Mayo, U.K.)
with 100× magnification and photographed with an attached camera.
The observations and deformities recorded in the gill architecture
were based on the considerations and terminology used earlier.84
