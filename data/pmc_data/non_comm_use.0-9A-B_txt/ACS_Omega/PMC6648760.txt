The
development of form-stable phase-change materials (FSPCMs)
with large latent heat, excellent thermal stability, and recyclability
is essential for their practical applications in thermal or solar
energy saving. In this paper, we first report the FSPCM composites
with exceptional latent heat by employment of sugar alcohol, in this
case erythritol (Ery) and mannitol (Man), as organic phase-change
materials (PCMs) and carbonized kapok fiber (KKf) with a high Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
surface area of up to 3396 m2 g–1 as
porous supporting materials. The unique hollow tubelike structure
of KKf makes it possible to load the organic PCMs inside and outside
the KKf tubes, and a high load value of 93% was achieved. The carbonized
KKf could not only endow itself robust thermal stability but also
significantly decrease supercooling while enhancing the thermal conductivity
of the PCM composites by over 130% compared with pure Ery and Man.
Compared with these reported PCM composites for low and medium temperature
usually having latent heat ranges from 150 to 258 J g–1, our PCM composites display exceptionally high latent heat ranging
from 297 to 350 J g–1, owing to the inherent large
latent heat of sugar alcohols. Notably, as a kind of natural plant
fiber with abundant availability, the employment of kapok fiber as
the supporting material via physical incorporation with sugar alcohols
thus makes the approach simple, green, and cost-effective, which is
of great technological significance for their real energy-saving applications
owing to their high energy storage performance, high loading values,
and enhanced thermal conductivity.

Introduction
The huge amount of global energy consumption
each year has led
to a number of severe issues, including the energy crisis of fossil
fuels, emerging ecological concerns, global warming, and so forth.1−3 Accordingly, there is an increasing interest for the development
of clean, renewable, and sustainable energy resources and techniques.4 In this regard, though traditional energy resources
such as solar energy,5 hydro energy, wind
energy,6 biomass energy, and nuclear energy
have long been exploited to maintain the development of human society
and modern industry, a big gap between supply and demand7 such as energy intermittence, geographical restrictions,
and so forth still remains a challenge.8 Therefore, it is of great importance to construct advanced energy-saving
strategies or highly efficient materials/devices to address these
issues.

Phase-change materials (PCMs) are a kind of energy-storage
material
which can store and release latent heat from the solid to the liquid
state or vice versa.9 Compared with traditional
energy resources, PCMs have great advantages, such as their high energy
storage density, low temperature changes, and considerable economic
benefit properties, and they have been considered as one of the frontier
emerging materials for solar and waste heat storage.10 Up to now, a number of PCMs or PCM composites have been
created, including inorganic salts or hydrated salts,11 paraffin,12 fatty acids,13 and polyethylene glycol.14−16 Generally,
inorganic salts possess high latent heat and, in most cases, were
used as a thermal energy storage medium under working condition ranges
from moderate temperature to high temperature.17 Comparatively, organic PCMs have great advantages of low
corrosion and melt/freeze cycles without phase segregation,18,19 and these have been extensively studied because of their promising
energy-saving applications. However, several essential issues still
remain an obstacle to their commercial use at large scale.20 First, the leakage of organic PCMs may occur
between melt/freeze cycles when they are directly applied, so packaging
them into polymeric microcapsules to form a core/shell structure or
incorporating them into porous supporting materials to manufacture
a composite is therefore a common approach for their real workable
operation.21 This, however, in turn results
in a multistep and complicated process with high manufacturing costs
or low PCM loading and poor thermal stability, especially for the
PCM composites discussed in this study.22 Second, the low thermal conductivity of organic PCMs, which originated
from their organic nature, would dramatically decrease their performance.23 This situation is much worse for those PCM microcapsules
where their polymeric shell serves as a barrier to impede thermal
transfer. Though great efforts have been made and huge progress has
been achieved to address these issues, the fabrication of a thermal
energy medium based on PCMs with desired thermal conductivity, high
latent heat, better thermal stability, and a simple and cost-effective
process still remains a challenge.

In our previous studies,
several kinds of form-stable phase-change
material (FSPCM) composites have been developed by incorporation of
organic PCMs into porous supporting materials including graphene-coated
nickel foam,24 MnO2 nanowire
and nanotubes,25 and polyethylene nanofoam.9 In these cases, both the porosity and the wettability
(e.g., to be superlipophilic) of porous supporting materials were
modified to achieve a better PCM loading and high thermal conductivity
by physical or chemical methods. However, the difficulty in the fabrication
of such nanoporous supporting materials may also cause other issues
such as high product cost or industrial scaled-up problems. Kapok
fiber (untreated kapok fiber named as Kf) is a kind of natural, tubelike
hollow fiber with an internal diameter of ca. 15 μm and a length
of about 25 ± 5 mm.26 In view of its
unique tubular morphology and easy commercial availability, Kf should
be ideal candidate as porous supporting materials for preparation
of PCM composites. To the best of our knowledge, however, few investigations
involving Kf as supporting materials have been reported so far. In
this regard, we report the design and preparation of novel FSPCM composites
employing erythritol (Ery) and mannitol (Man) as PCMs and the carbonized
kapok fiber treated with potassium hydroxide at 800 °C (KKf)
as porous supporting materials via a simple and “green”
method (no chemicals were used during the whole process). As a proof-of-concept
study, the resulting FSPCM composites possess enhanced thermal conductivity
and high latent heat. Furthermore, the manufacturing process is easy
to be scaled up for industrialization, which may open up a new way
for fabrication of high-performance PCM composites based on natural
products as a heat-storage medium for real applications.

Results and Discussion
In this work, kapok fiber (Kf), which has a distinct hollow structure
and characteristics such as low-cost, being environmentally friendly,
and being rich for carbon production, was used as the raw material
for preparation of the porous support material to fabricate the PCM
composites. The tremendously large specific surface area (3396 m2 g–1) of carbonized kapok fiber treated
with potassium hydroxide at 800 °C (KKf) revealed KOH plays a
vital role in this process by maintaining the collapse of pores and
can also be used to expand interior porosity after subsequent acid
leaching, leading to production of a much more interconnected pore
structure with a high number of micro- and mesopores. These characteristics
provide possibilities to load large PCMs and enhance the thermal conductivity
of PCM composites. The schematic procedure is shown in Scheme 1. The liquid PCMs were in contact
with the KKf when the temperature was above the melting point of the
PCMs. Because of the large specific surface area of KKf, the liquid
PCMs permeated inside the KKf and filled the entire tube. It is worth
noting that the PCMs were also trapped on the outer surface of the
KKf, with the load rate up to over 93%; thus, KKf would be a promising
candidate for preparing FSPCM composites.

Scheme 1 The Production Process
of the KKf/PCMs
The morphologies
of Kf before and after corrosion were observed
by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy
(TEM). As shown in Figure 1a,b, the SEM images of Kf have a hollow tubular structure
with a smooth surface, owing to the coverage of inherent plant wax.
Macroscopically, they are connected with each other to form a network
structure. Figure 1c,d is the TEM image of the Kf; the presence of the cylindrical shaped
structure of kapok fibers is apparent, and such an observation is
consistent with the previous literature results.27 Such a unique hollow tubular structure of Kf facilitates
the loading of PCMs; Kf facilitates the loading of PCMs inside and
outside the tubes of Kf. The KKf SEM images (Figure 1e,f) show that the etched kapok fibers maintain
a tubular structure, whereas the wall of the tube is rough and a number
of pores present on the wall were observed, which indicates an obvious
corrosion, and the waxy coating has been removed from the fiber surface.
The corresponding TEM images (Figure 1g,h) indicate that the tube wall of kapok fibers after
potassium hydroxide treatment is significantly thinned, confirming
that the impurities and pectin on the fiber surface have been removed. Figure 1i–k shows
the SEM images of KKf after loading of PCMs, in this case, sugar alcohols.
It can be seen that almost all KKf surfaces are covered with sugar
alcohols both outside and inside the tubes. Also, the PCM-loaded KKf
tubes stack and connect closely with each other to form a loose architecture,
which along with their hollow tubular structure is also favorable
for the loading of sugar alcohols.

(c,d) Kf, SEM images of (e,f)
KKf, TEM images of (g,h) KKf, and SEM images of KKf/PCMs (i–k).
Scale bar: (a) 1, (b) 10, (c,d) 2, and (e–j) 1 μm.

Elemental mapping of typical single
KKf combined with Man (the
sample named as KKf/Man) was further investigated by EDS, and results
are shown in Figure 2. As can be seen, the red and orange in the energy-dispersive X-ray
(EDX) mapping, belonging to C–K and O–K, respectively,
distribute the average along the surface of kapok fibers, which indicates
the presence of C and O originating from organic PCMs, confirming
successful loading of sugar alcohols onto the KKf. Interestingly,
a secondary porous network structure also apparently appeared along
the wall of tubes (marked as the red arrow in Figure 2), which may also be responsible for its
extremely large specific Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)
surface area (see porosity analysis in Figure 3).

Figure 2 TEM–EDX mapping of KKf/Man.

Figure 3 (a) Nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms of KKf
measured
at 77.3 K and (b) pore size distribution for KKf, calculated according
to desorption data.

The porosity properties
of the KKf were evaluated by nitrogen gas
adsorption and desorption measurement at 77.3 K. As shown in Figure 3a, the KKf exhibits
type IV adsorption and desorption isotherms. The BET surface area
of the KKf was calculated to be 3396 m2 g–1, based on the t-plot method. All of the experimental
data are summarized in Table 1. The estimated pore volume of KKf is 1.94 cm3 g–1. These microspores are obtained from the inherent
voids formed by evaporation of less stable substances and gas during
pyrolysis and activation processes. Apparently, the KOH activation
contributes to the large specific surface area. The pore size distribution
of KKf obtained through Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH)
analysis is shown in Figure 3b. From the analysis of Figure 3b, the pore size distribution diagram shows that KKf
consists of micropores. The average porosity of adsorption is 2.29
nm. It can be seen that KKf is mainly composed of micropores (1.7–2
nm).

KKf	3396	884	0.48	1.94	2.29	
Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) spectra are used to further confirm
the changes in chemical compositions for the initial Kf, carbonized
Kf (CKf), and sodium hydroxide solution-treated Kf (KKf), as shown
in Figure 4. The KKf,
as well as CKf, has an obvious peak at 3415 cm–1, which is the stretching vibration peak of surface −OH. In
addition, CKf shows the vibrations of the aliphatic CH groups at 2920
cm–1. Compared with CKf and KKf, Kf reveals more
different peaks, ranging from 1744 to 1047 cm–1.
The peak at 1741 cm–1 for Kf corresponds to the
carboxylic group. The assignment of other peaks for Kf is summarized
in Table 2.28 The analysis on the FTIR spectra of Kf, by comparison
with CKf and KKf, fully confirmed that the wax and impurities on the
fiber surface have been moved in view of the disappearance of the
oxygen-containing groups after carbonization and KOH etching.

The detailed degree
of graphitization in CKf and KKf was investigated
by Raman spectroscopy, and the results are shown in Figure 5. It is well known that Raman
spectra of carbon materials generally have sharp peaks at 1346 and
1587 cm–1, which are referred to as D and G bands,
respectively. The D band (defect band) is a disorder from the graphitized
structure due to in-plane defects such as defects and heteroatoms.
The G band due to the stretching vibration mode having E2g symmetry in the aromatic layer of the crystalline graphite represents
the degree of order of the graphite structure. In general, the intensity
ratio recorded as R = ID/IG is commonly used to estimate the
degree of disorder in graphite.29 As shown
in Figure 5a, both
of the samples display two distinctive peaks at around 1326 and 1578
cm–1, corresponding to D and G band, respectively. Figure 5b,c presents the R values 3.04 and 1.19, which implies KKf has a higher graphitic
structure.

CKf and KKf.

Figure 6 shows the
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of KKf, pure Man, and KKf/Man. As
shown in Figure 6,
the XRD pattern of hollow KKf shows a characteristic peak at 22.37°
corresponding to the (002) crystallographic planes of cellulose. Pure
Man has distinct peak shapes at 14.79°, 18.65°, and 23.62°,
which are basically consistent with the data mentioned in the previous
literature.30 Compared with the XRD peak
shape of the pure material, no new peak appeared in KKf/Man, which
indicates the PCMs are physically loaded onto KKf. Though the shape
is similar, both the position and the peak intensity slightly changes,
indicating that the crystal size of sugar alcohols changes slightly
when combined with KKf in a confined space.

Figure 6 XRD of KKf, pure Man,
and KKf/Man.

The phase-change behavior,
including the phase-change latent heat
and the phase-change temperature, is essential to the PCM and was
measured by the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) technique. Figure 7a displays the DSC
curves of pure Man, KKf/Man, and KKf/Man after 500 cycles, whereas
DSC curves of pure Ery, KKf combined with Ery (KKf/Ery), and KKf/Ery
after 500 cycles are shown in Figure 7b. Moreover, the PCM latent heat percent of pure PCMs
and PCM composites can be calculated by the following equation25,31  where ΔH (PCM composite)
refers to the latent heat of the PCM composite and ΔH (pure sugar alcohols) refers to the latent heat of the
relevant pure PCM. A higher ω value suggests more preservation
of the crystalline phase in the composites.31

Figure 7 DSC
curves of different pure sugar alcohols and PCM composites.

The phase change parameters and
enthalpy of pure sugar alcohols
and composites are listed in the Table 3. As shown in Table 3, the mass fraction of pure Man and Ery in the KKf/Man
and KKf/Ery, and that in KKf/Man and KKf/Ery after 500 cycles of heating
and cooling was found to be 92.54 and 94.41, and 77.29 and 87.42%,
respectively, indicating a large loading capacity of Man and Ery in
the composites, and the values are higher than those of Ery/EG32 (15–20%), paraffin/EG33 (10%), C–SiO2-PA34 (61%), and gypsum/C18–C2435 (18%) systems. The high ω value for the
PCM composites is due to the fact that KKf has a unique hollow tubular
structure and huge surface area, which provide much more spaces to
allow the loading of sugar alcohols in the composite during the melting
and cooling. In previous literatures, common cotton has been investigated
as a PCM supporting material. In that case, three kinds of microcapsules
were prepared from common cotton, and the encapsulation ratio is measured
to be 35.62, 41.47, and 35.09%. The low incorporation ratio may be
due to the fact that the cotton is not hollow in appearance. In this
case, in view of its unique tubular morphology and easy commercial
availability, Kf should be an ideal candidate as porous supporting
materials for preparation of PCM composites. The latent heat storage
values of Man, KKf/Man, and KKf/Man after 500 cycles of heating and
cooling were measured to be 321.86, 297.84, and 248.75 J g–1, respectively, whereas for Ery, KKf/Ery, and KKf/Ery after 500 cycles
of heating and cooling, the latent heat corresponded to 341.53, 322.46,
and 298.54 J g–1, respectively. Similar observations
have been documented in several recent investigations on composite
PCMs.36 On the other hand, clearly, the
latent heat of Man (321.86 J g–1) and Ery (341.53
J g–1) are larger than that of a number of conventional
organic PCMs used in the medium temperature range,37 including paraffin wax (250 J g–1), high-density
polyethylene (160 J g–1), phthalic anhydride (321
J g–1), and hydroquinone (258 J g–1), as shown in Figure 8. Though a number of investigations involving sugar alcohols as PCMs
have been performed by theoretical simulation, only a few studies
involving the use of sugar alcohols for preparation of PCM composites
have been reported to date. With these values, the latent heat for
KKf/Man and KKf/Ery are larger than that of paraffin/CMPs,38 paraffin/xGnP,39 and
PP/MA9 composites, owing to the intrinsic
larger latent heat of Man and Ery.

Moreover,
it was observed from the DSC curves that the freezing
temperatures of Man and Ery in composites (KKf/Man and KKf/Ery) increase
compared with those of pure Man and Ery. That is, the supercooling
of these two kinds of sugar alcohol PCMs is greatly decreased by incorporation
of Man and Ery into the kapok fiber. The melting and freezing temperatures
(Table 3) were measured
to be 171.06 and 117.38 °C, respectively, for Man; 173.74 and
129.42 °C, respectively, for KKf/Man; and 171.93 and 118.85 °C,
respectively, for KKf/Man after 500 heating and cooling cycles, which
is a decrease of 9.36 and 0.6 °C of supercooling for these two
samples, respectively. For Ery and KKf/Ery, and KKf/Ery after 500
heating and cooling cycles, the supercooling decreased 9.58 and 4.9
°C, respectively. The phenomenon is attributed to the rapid crystallization
rate of the Man and Ery in composites originating from the restricted
molecular motion area and increased regional undercooling caused by
the enhanced viscosity.40 It is well known
that the sugar alcohols have large latent heat compared with other
organic PCMs (e.g., paraffin wax); unfortunately, however, usually
their large supercooling degree makes them unsuitable for practical
applications. In this case, interestingly, the decrease in the supercooling
of PCM composites based on Man and Ery is greatly advantageous for
their practical applications, in addition to their large latent heat.
The phenomenon for latent heat of the cooling process is much smaller
than that of heating process is common for PCMs composites. In the
heating stage, the PCMs tend to disorder from their ordered structure
because of an endothermic process. In this case, according to the
published literature, Ery is identified with at least two crystalline
forms, a metastable polymorph and a stable crystalline. The stable
crystalline form is only obtained upon heating the frozen solid or
leaving it for a long time at room temperature. Hence, in the cooling
stage, it has a relative lower latent heat than that in the heating
stage. To our knowledge, such an observation has rarely been reported
for sugar alcohol-based FSPCMs so far.

The thermal stability
for PCMs is one of main factors for its applications.41 In this study, we evaluate the thermal stability
of the resulting PCM composites by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA).
From Figure 9, it can
be seen that the KKf was stable and decomposed slightly at 31.78 °C.
It may be that a small amount of water was absorbed before the test
and was lost at this time. The quality of the KKf at 461 °C obviously
increased. Because the test was under a nitrogen atmosphere, this
process may have absorbed a part of nitrogen because of the large
specific surface area and porous nature, whereas only 13.83% of the
KKf has been lost in the whole process, which proved the stability
of the carrier. Pure Man started to decompose around 239 °C and
completely decomposed around 400 °C. Although the initial decomposition
temperature and complete decomposition temperature of the composite
were almost the same as those of pure Man, the composite was reduced
by 93.42% over the course of the entire process, about 5.2% increase
compared to pure Man, indicating that Man was dispersed into the pores
of KKf.

Figure 9 TGA curves of KKf, pure Man, and KKf/Man between room temperature
and 800 °C.

The thermal conductivity
of pure sugar alcohols and the as-synthesized
PCM composites was investigated by using a thermal conductivity tester,
and the results are shown in Table 4. The thermal conductivity of pure Man is 0.265 W m–1 K–1, whereas the KKf/Man exhibits
a much more high thermal conductivity of up to 0.353 W m–1 K–1, which is about 133% higher than that of the
control. Similarly, KKf/Ery also shows an enhanced thermal conductivity
of 0.401 W m–1 K–1, equal to 131%
of that of pure Ery (0.305 W m–1 K–1). Clearly, a significant improvement of thermal conductivity was
achieved when pure sugar alcohols were loaded into KKf, owing to the
inherently high thermal conductivity of KKf and its interconnected
carbon skeleton. Therefore, during the heat transfer process, thanks
to the presence of interconnected three-dimensional honeycomb-like
carbon, heat conduction was rapid and effective along the carbon skeleton,
resulting in the significant increase of thermal conductivity of composites.
In this regard, the KKf used here can not only serve as supporting
materials but also could significantly improve their thermal conductivity
without adding any additive.

Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated an approach for the creation of
novel FSPCM composites with exceptional latent heat by employment
of two kinds of sugar alcohols as organic PCMs and carbonized kapok
fiber as porous supporting materials. Compared with other FSPCM composites
based on porous supporting materials such as carbon nanotubes, porous
polymers, and so on, the carbonized kapok fiber, as a kind of natural
plant fiber with abundant availability, has great advantages such
as its high BET surface area (up to 3396 m2 g–1) and unique cylindrical structure with hollow pores in the tubular
wall, which could provide a larger accessible surface and faster transport
channel for loading of sugar alcohols. Furthermore, compared with
the reported PCM composites for low and medium temperatures, usually
having latent heat ranges from 150 to 258 J g–1,
our PCM composites display exceptionally high latent heat ranging
from 297 to 350 J g–1 because of the inherent large
latent heat of sugar alcohols, in addition to their enhanced thermal
conductivity, large loading value, excellent thermal stability, and
dramatically reduced supercooling. Based on these merits, the resulting
PCM composites may have great potential as a promising heat-storage
medium for solar energy or other thermal energy saving applications.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Kapok fiber (Kf) was purchased from Shanghai
Panda Co. Ltd., China. Ery and Man were received from Shanghai Macklin
Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd., China. All chemicals were used as
received without further purification.

Preparation of Kapok Fiber
as the Supporter Material
An appropriate amount of Kf was
put it into 2 wt % NaOH solution
and kept for 48 h to remove the wax and impurities on the fiber surface.
The as-treated fiber was repeatedly washed with distilled water until
the pH reached neutrality and then dried in an oven at 105 °C.
The treated kapok fiber was first placed into a porcelain boat and
carbonized at 650 °C for 70 min. After that, the precarbonized
kapok fiber (CKf) was mixed with KOH and then heated to 800 °C
under a nitrogen atmosphere; this temperature was maintained for 2
h. The sample was thoroughly washed with 1 M HCl to remove the residual
KOH. Finally, the resulting fiber was washed with hot distilled water
several times until the filtrate reached neutral and was dried at
105 °C overnight. The as-prepared sample was marked as KKf.

Preparation of Form-Stable KKf/PCM Composite Materials
The
KKf/PCMs were prepared through the melting-impregnation method
by using Ery and Man as PCMs and KKf as the supporting materials.
The resulting samples were named as KKf/Ery and KKf/Man, respectively.
Taking KKf/Man as an example, Man was placed in a glass beaker and
then put it into a vacuum drying oven at 120 °C. After completely
dissolving the Man, a certain amount of KKf was added into the beaker
and kept for a certain time to ensure the Man fully covered the surface
of KKf. After that, the sample was taken out from the vacuum drying
oven and cooled to room temperature. To ensure no leakage of the composites,
the composites were removed onto the glass plate and then moved to
the vacuum drying oven. The above process was repeated until no liquid
was observed on the glass and the weight of the composites no longer
changed. The resulting sample was named as KKf/Man. KKf/Ery was fabricated
by using the same method by using Ery as PCMs.

Material Characterization
The micromorphology of the
supporting materials and PCM composites was observed by using cold
field emission SEM (JSMM-6701F, JEOL, Ltd.) and TEM (JEM-1200EX, FEI,
Co.). XRD measurements were performed on a Rigaku D/Max-2400 diffractometer
with a Cu tube source, and 2θ scans were obtained from 10 to
80 °C. The BET surface areas and band pore structures of resulting
ZCMPs were measured by using a micromeritics ASAP 2020 apparatus at
77.3 K. All samples were degassed at 120 °C overnight under vacuum
before analysis. FTIR spectra were recorded in the wavelength range
of 4000–400 cm–1 using the KBr pellet technique
on a Nexus 670 spectrum instrument. The thermal properties of PCM
composites and pure PCM were determined by DSC (Netzsch DSC 200 F3)
at a heating and cooling rate of 5 °C min–1 in the range of 20–180 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere.
The thermal diffusivities and the specific heat for the KKb/PCM composites
were measured at 25 °C by a thermal conductivity testing instrument
(LFA 457 MicroFlash, NETZSCH). EDX spectrometry was performed on a
cold field emission scanning electron microscope (JEM-1200EX). Raman
spectra were all recorded via a Raman spectrometer (JY-HR800 micro
Raman) with an argon-ion laser (λ = 532 nm).
