In this work, the self-assembly behavior
of cetyltrimethylammonium
bromide (CTAB) on the surface of citrate-capped gold nanoparticles
(AuNPs) in solution has been studied by UV–vis absorption spectroscopy,
fluorescence probe techniques, ζ potentiometric methods, transmission
electron microscopy, etc. The UV–vis spectra show that the
color with the increase of CTAB for the mixture containing CTAB and
a given amount of AuNPs changes from red to blue and then to red.
The absolute value of ζ potential corresponding to this color
change decreases initially and then increases. Specially, the reversible
color change, from red to blue and then to red, could be observed
only in the case of a gradual addition of a AuNP solution to a CTAB
solution; however, this reversible change is not suitable for the
mixture formed in a reverse order of mixing. The results from pyrene
used as the fluorescence probe indicate that the features in the fluorescence
spectrum (including fluorescence quenching, I1/I3, and the excimer) well correspond
to those from the UV–vis spectrum mentioned above. Based on
the experimental results, the mechanism of the assembly structure
variation of CTAB on the surface of negatively charged AuNPs was proposed.
For a given amount of AuNPs, the assembly structure of CTAB on the
surface of AuNPs undergoes the transformation from a monolayer to
a bilayer with the increase of CTAB. In the case of the concentration
of CTAB far beyond its critical micelle concentration (CMC) and the
higher ratio of CTAB and AuNPs, there is a possibility of the formation
of an extra micellar structure only after the formation of a double-layer
structure.

Introduction
Surfactants play a key role in the synthesis
and functionalization
of metal nanoparticles.1 Generally, a surfactant
seems to be one of the desirable structure-directing agents inducing
anisotropic growth in aqueous media through binding to specific nanocrystal
facets, achieving the controlled growth and shape of the particles.2 By binding to some crystal surfaces and decreasing
the surface energy, they also act as a stabilizer against coagulation.3 In addition, the presence of these moieties on
the surface of nanoparticles causes new and/or improved properties,
which makes them important in biological activity, catalytic behavior,
chemical sensing,4−12 optical properties, etc.3 Hence, deepening
the understanding of the interaction between surfactants and metal
nanoparticles is of significance for their application.

Among
the surfactants used in the preparation of metallic nanoparticles,
cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) has been the most typical representative
to grow gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with different morphologies, such
as gold nanorods (AuNRs),13−15 hexagonal and triangular nanocrystalline
gold plates,16 bimetallic nanoparticles,17 high-index faceted gold nanocrystals,18,19 and gold nanocubes.20

The development
of the methods for preparing metal nanomaterials
with various morphologies has promoted the exploration of the growth
mechanism as well as the surface structure of the NPs capped with
surfactants. In the synthesis of rod-shaped gold nanoparticles, Nikoobakht
and El-Sayed proposed that CTAB as the major and cosurfactant tetradodecylammonium
bromide (TOAB) as the minor component in the mixture form a bilayer
structure, rather than a micelle, around AuNRs.21 This conclusion was also supported by Murphy and Mann et
al. They reported that a surfactant micelle is not involved in controlling
the shape anisotropy of metallic nanoparticles.22 Since then, the model of a CTAB bilayer structure rather
than a micelle around the surface of AuNPs has been widely approved.23−25 This bilayer structure was also proved in the preparation of AuNPs
using CTAB and cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) as a cosurfactant.26 Murphy et al. using 1-naphthol as a probe also
proved the rationality of the double-layer structure of CTAB on the
surface of gold nanorods,27 and they also
verified this structure on the surface of AuNPs by replacing CTAB
with the polymerizable surfactant 11-(acryloyloxy)-undecyl-trimethyl
ammonium bromide in the preparation of polymer-stabilized AuNPs.28 Baruah et al. found that the stability of the
double-layer structure of CTAB formed on AuNPs could be enhanced by
nonylamine (NA) as a cosurfactant.29 Recently,
the double-layer structure of CTAB on the surface of AuNPs was confirmed
by a multiscale model that combines first-principles methods with
atomistic and mesoscopic simulations.30

Although the double-layer structure of CTAB formed in the
preparation
of AuNRs has almost become a consensus, even now, the assembly structure
of CTAB on the surface of already-prepared negatively charged AuNPs
is still controversial. Recently, on the basis of the results of small-angle
neutron scattering (SANS), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) techniques,
etc., Skoglund et al. proposed that the negatively charged AgNPs were
stabilized by CTAB cluster micelles rather than a double-layer structure
of CTAB.31 Based on the color change of
the negatively charged AuNPs induced by CTAB or CTAC at their concentrations exceeding the critical
micelle concentration (CMC), a similar conclusion was also drawn.32,33 Although the CTAB bilayer structure is easier to form on the facets
of gold nanorods than on spherical gold nanoparticles,2 it is also possible to produce the bilayer structure of
CTAB on the surface of negatively charged AuNPs.

We believe
that the difference in the reported assembly structure
of CTAB on the negatively charged AuNPs is related to the relative
proportion of CTAB and AuNPs in the experimental process. As the positively
charged CTAB molecules are added into the solution containing a given
amount of the negatively charged AuNPs, the assembly structure of
CTAB onto the surface of AuNPs and their stability change with CTAB.
With the increase in the amount of CTAB added, the assembly structure
of CTAB onto the surface of AuNPs undergoes a change from an incomplete
to a complete hydrophobic single layer.34 During the above process, not only the charge on AuNPs gradually
decreases but also the surface hydrophobicity enhances. As a result,
the tendency of AuNPs aggregation is gradually enhanced. It is worth
noting that the aggregation of AuNPs leads to the irreversible fusion
among AuNPs if the amount of CTAB covered on AuNPs is not sufficient
to block the contact among AuNPs.35 However,
the aggregation of AuNPs covered with monolayer CTAB is reversible
due to enough isolation of the CTAB layer. In this case, the hydrophobic
tail of the added CTAB can insert into the CTAB single layer on the
surface of AuNPs through a hydrophobic interaction gradually to form
a complete bilayer structure of CTAB, similar to a lipid bilayer.28 The above transformation from the monolayer
to the bilayer makes the aggregated AuNPs disperse due to the enhancement
of electrostatic repulsion and hydrophilicity. During this transformation,
if the formation of a CTAB monolayer on AuNPs is reasonable, it is
difficult to understand that CTAB molecules bound in the monolayer
can be completely released to participate in the formation of CTAB
micelles together with the added CTAB.

Obviously, the assembly
structure of CTAB on the surface of AuNPs
is closely related to the relative proportion of CTAB and AuNPs rather
than the concentration of CTAB. It was reported in the literature
that AuNPs have a stable dispersion state when the concentration of
CTAB approaches CMC. Based on this finding, it was concluded that
AuNPs were stabilized by surrounding CTAB micelles, which may be a
coincidence. In fact, for a given surfactant, its CMC is different
from that in the presence of an electrolyte. The presence of the negatively
charged AuNPs may decrease the CMC of the surfactant, which is similar
to that of electrolyte.36 Therefore, only
when the concentration of CTAB far exceeds its CMC, both the CTAB
double-layer structure and micelles around AuNPs could be simultaneously
present. Actually, this situation has been described in the literature.37,38

To explore the influence of exogenous CTAB on the aggregation
of
the prepared negatively charged AuNPs as well as the corresponding
mechanism, this work detailedly studied the behaviors for a series
of specially designed mixtures containing CTAB and citrate-capped
AuNPs using UV–vis spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy,
ζ potential analysis, and fluorescence probe techniques. The
following main findings are included in our investigations: (1) CTAB
micelles are not stable in AuPN solution and are prone to disassemble
and reassemble on the surface of AuNPs. (2) As long as CTAB/AuNPs
are in a proper ratio, the above-mentioned assembly could occur regardless
of the CTAB concentration being lower or higher than its CMC. (3)
The mixing sequence of the positively charged CTAB and the negatively
charged AuNPs can directly impact the reversibility of the aggregation
of AuNPs induced by the CTAB assembly. These results could be explained
in terms of the change in the self-assembly structure of CTAB from
a single layer to a double layer and the ζ potential of the
corresponding assemblies. The present investigation is expected to
not only help understand the self-assembled structure of CTAB on the
surface of AuNPs but also provide a basis for the research associated
with the special effects of surfactants on the surface of AuNPs and
their applications, for example, based on the sensitivity in electrostatic
interaction, developing some approaches to monitor negatively charged
species (surfactants, polyelectrolytes, biomolecules, etc.) and methods
to prepare some arrays using AuNPs loaded with the monolayer or bilayer
of CTAB as a structural unit.

Results and Discussion
Effect of CTAB on the UV–Vis
Spectrum of AuNPs
Figure 1a depicts
the UV–vis absorption spectra of the mixture (mixture A) containing
different concentrations of CTAB and 1.50 × 1012 NPs/mL
of AuNPs. Photos of the corresponding typical color change of the
mixtures are shown on the top of Figure 1a. Overall, the trend of the color change
in AuNPs with the increase of CTAB is similar to the results reported
in the literature.32 This phenomenon, the
color variation from red to blue and then from blue to red for the
AuNP solution with the increase of CTAB, could be explained in terms
of the change in the charge feature of AuNPs. Due to gradual adsorption
of CTAB with a positive charge onto the surface of AuNPs with a negative
charge, the original negative charge of AuNPs gradually increases
to zero and then from zero to a positive charge. This change directly
results in the change of the dispersity of AuNPs.

Figure 1 (a) Change in the UV–vis
spectrum with different CTAB concentrations
for the mixture of CTAB and a given amount of AuNPs (1.50 × 1012 NPs/mL), and photos (top) of the corresponding samples.
(b) Change in the ζ potential of citrate-capped AuNPs (1.50
× 1012 NPs/mL) with different concentrations of CTAB.
(c) Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of AuNPs in the
presence of different CTAB contents.

From the precise spectral variation (Figure 1a) related to the above-mentioned phenomenon,
the as-prepared citrate-capped AuNPs have a typical surface plasmon
resonance (SPR) peak at 526 nm (black curve), and this plasmon absorption
slightly red-shifts to 530 nm after CTAB is introduced from 0.0075
to 0.01 mM. This slight red shift is attributed to the partial replacement
of citrate on the surface of AuNPs by CTAB molecules.39,40 At the same time, an additional broad peak centered at 600–900
nm appears with different intensities, corresponding to a purple-to-blue
color change for AuNPs. This phenomenon suggests the aggregation of
AuNPs in different degrees.40 Interestingly,
the broad peak evidently blue-shifts as CTAB concentration is increased
to above 1 mM and even almost disappears when CTAB concentration is
further increased above 2 mM, whereas the SPR peak at 530 nm increases
steadily in intensity (orange curve). As CTAB concentration is increased
to 5 mM (red curve), the absorption in the range of 600–900
nm completely disappears, and the SPR peak located at 530 nm turns
out to be almost the same as that of a pure AuNP solution (526 nm).

The evolution feature of the above UV–vis spectra unambiguously
indicates that the aggregation of AuNPs also occurs even when the
concentration of CTAB exceeds its CMC, implying that the dispersed
AuNPs in the presence of CTAB is not stabilized by the structure of
CTAB micelles. As we proposed above, in the higher concentration of
CTAB as shown in Figure 1, the stability of AuNP dispersion is achieved by a CTAB double-layer
structure rather than CTAB micelles.31 In
our opinion, the evolution of CTAB assembly structures on AuNPs could
be explained by the following corresponding changes in ζ potential,
as shown in Figure 1b.

It can be seen that the ζ potential for AuNPs is −36
mV in the absence of CTAB, which is relevant to that of a citrate
anion absorbed on the surface of AuNPs, resulting in a dispersed state
with a red color due to electrostatic repulsion.41 For AuNP solutions in the presence of CTAB ranging from
0 to 0.025 mM, the ζ potential of the mixtures remarkably increases
from −36 mV to nearly 0 mV and corresponds to the dramatic
aggregation of AuNPs in blue or gray color. Then, the ζ potential
increases from 0 mV to a positive value when the CTAB concentration
is greater than 0.025 mM and finally reaches +28.26 mV as the CTAB
concentration reaches 5 mM. In this situation, the AuNP solution presents
a gradual change in color from blue to red, which implies the increase
in the stability of AuNPs. This trend is coincident with that in the
reported literature23,32,42 and is in good agreement with the change in the spectral results
(Figure 1a). Significantly,
the ζ potential curve shown in Figure 1b presents three linear trends, −32.04
to −3.96 mV, −3.96 to +2.876 mV, and 2.876 to +28.26
mV, which correspond to the CTAB concentration ranging from 0 to 0.0015
mM, 0.0015 to 0.025 mM, and 0.025 to 5 mM, respectively, implying
that the three stages are related to the structural transformation
of CTAB assembled on the surface of AuNPs.

In the first stage,
the ζ potential increases from the negative
to nearly zero in the concentration of CTAB ranging from 0 to 0.0015
mM. This change corresponds to the formation of an incomplete single
layer of CTAB, and the corresponding driving force is attributed to
the electrostatic interaction between the positively charged ammonium
moiety of CTAB and the negatively charged AuNPs. Since CTAB molecules
with a positive charge adsorb onto the bare negatively charged AuNPs,
the increase of the ζ potential with increasing CTAB is relatively
fast. In the second stage, the ζ potential slowly changes to
around zero in the concentration of CTAB ranging from 0.0015 to 0.025
mM, corresponding to the transition from an incomplete monolayer to
a complete single layer driven by the electrostatic interaction. Due
to the decrease in the negative charge and increase in the steric
resistance, CTAB molecules adsorbed onto AuNPs inhibit the subsequent
CTAB molecules from being adsorbed onto AuNPs. Therefore, in this
stage, the corresponding ζ potential shows a relatively slow
increase with the increase of CTAB. In the last stage, the ζ
potential increases from nearly zero to positive in the concentration
of CTAB ranging from 0.025 to 5 mM, and this stage involves the formation
of a perfect bilayer of CTAB and the ensuing formation of CTAB micelles.
Obviously, the driving force in this stage is ascribed to the hydrophobic
interaction involving the insertion of free hydrophobic tails of CTAB
into the hydrophobic palisade already formed on the AuNPs. In this
stage, the insertion of the hydrophobic alkyl chain of CTAB into the
hydrophobic palisade is relatively difficult and the increase of the
ζ potential with the increase of CTAB is relatively slow.

To verify the difference in the dispersed state of AuNPs in the
presence of a typical concentration of CTAB, we recorded TEM images
for the AuNP samples in the presence of a typical concentration of
CTAB (0, 0.0075, 1.0, and 2.5 mM) [see UV–vis spectra (Figure 1a)], and the results
are shown in Figure 1c. Clearly, these images present the process from dispersion to aggregation
and to re-dispersion. These results well match with the corresponding
changes in the UV–vis spectra and ζ potentials. According
to the evolution of CTAB assembling structures onto AuNPs with the
increase of CTAB, the resultant structures correspond to without CTAB,
an incomplete monolayer, an incomplete bilayer, and a complete bilayer.

Additionally, the slight red shift of the SPR peak for the mixture
of AuNPs and CTAB compared with that for AuNPs indicates that there
is a strong interaction between CTAB and AuNPs. Thus, CTAB molecules
adsorbed on the surface of AuNPs do not have a significant desorption
and together with newly added CTAB are involved in the formation of
the micelles. Certainly, the above observation does not mean that
it is impossible to form CTAB micelles in the mixture of CTAB and
AuNPs. In fact, there is still enough CTAB in the mixture after the
amount of CTAB satisfies the formation of bilayers on the surface
of AuNPs, and the formation of CTAB micelles in the mixture is possible.
A similar situation could be found in the literature.37,38 On the basis of above-mentioned discussion, we think that the conclusion
in the reported literature regarding the formation of CTAB micelles
rather than the CTAB bilayer around AuNPs is probably related to the
less amount of AuNPs used in the experiments, and this conclusion
is an experimental coincidence rather than a necessity.

According
to our proposal, in the mixture of AuNPs and CTAB, the
lower the concentration of AuNPs, the lower the CTAB concentration
inducing the color change of AuNPs. Namely, the color change of the
mixtures of AuNPs and CTAB from red to blue and then to red is possible
in the case of the CTAB concentration below its CMC as long as the
number of CTAB molecules is far more than that of AuNPs. For our hypothesis
to be confirmed, 20 μL of AuNP solution, instead of 2 mL of
AuNPs used in the experiments shown in Figure 1, was introduced into 2 mL of CTAB solutions
with different concentrations less than CMC, and the UV–vis
absorption spectra of the corresponding mixtures were detected, as
shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Change
in the UV–vis spectra with different concentrations
of CTAB (<CMC) for the mixture of CTAB and a given amount of AuNPs
(3 × 1010 NPs/mL).

As expected, when the CTAB concentration is in the range of 0.01–0.16
mM, compared with AuNP solution, the SPR peak at 526 nm hardly shifts,
while an obvious new peak appears in the range of 600–800 nm,
implying in this case that the AuNPs are aggregated even with a CTAB
concentration of 0.01 mM. With the increase of the CTAB concentration
from 0.01 to 0.6 mM, the intensity of the absorption at the wavelength
above 600 nm continuously decreases until the spectrum becomes similar
to that of AuNPs. The above results clearly show that the conversion
from the aggregated into the dissociated AuNPs still occurs even with
a CTAB concentration far lower than CMC. Apparently, this process
is unlikely to involve the formation of CTAB micelles. In this case,
the only possible structure for AuNPs stabilized by CTAB is the bilayer
rather than the micelle.

As a summary of the experimental results
shown in Figures 1 and 2, Figure 3 gives a
schematic model of the self-assembly structure variation of CTAB on
the surface of citrate-capped AuNPs. This model involves six typical
states, according to the amount of CTAB adsorbed onto the surface
of AuNPs. These are state 1 (citrate-capped AuNPs), state 2 (an incomplete
monolayer of CTAB), state 3 (a complete monolayer of CTAB), state
4 (an imperfect bilayer of CTAB), state 5 (a perfect bilayer of CTAB),
and state 6 (the coexistence of the bilayer and micelle of CTAB).
Among them, state 1–state 2, state 2–state 3, and state
3–state 6 correspond to the first, the second, and the last
stage in the ζ potential, respectively. The corresponding color
in turn changes from red to purple, blue, purple, and red. The above
process could be explained in terms of the self-assembly of the positively
charged CTAB onto the negatively charged AuNPs and in turn resulting
in the change of the ζ potential. It is particularly pointed
out here that the above change depends not only on the CTAB concentration
but also on the ratio of CTAB and AuNP. Additionally, only after the
formation of the bilayer of CTAB on the surface of AuNPs, the CTAB
micelles around AuNPs could form when the amount of CTAB was enough
to form the micelles. To verify the proposed model, we carried out
the following experiments.

Figure 3 Proposed possible mechanism for the variation
in the assembly structure
of CTAB on the citrate-capped AuNPs.

Pyrene Probing of the Assembly Structure of CTAB on the AuNPs
Figure 4a shows
the fluorescence spectra of pyrene in a series of mixtures with different
ratios of AuNPs to CTAB as given in the mixture C. A characteristic
emission peak of pyrene in pure water (cyan curve) is observed, while
the fluorescence is almost completely quenched in the presence of
AuNPs (green curve, state 1). This phenomenon can be explained using
the energy transfer mechanism of the high-efficiency quenching effect
of AuNPs on fluorescence probes.43 Note
that here quenching belongs to a dynamic fluorescence quenching, which
depends only on collision, since there is no special chemical interaction
between pyrene and AuNPs. As a result, compared with bare AuNPs with
an exposed surface, which can easily contact with the probe, AuNP
solution in the presence of CTAB should show a weaker fluorescence
quenching due to AuNPs covered by CTAB in varying degrees. As expected,
compared with that for state 1 (green curve), the fluorescence quenching
for the AuNP solution containing 0.0075 mM CTAB (blue curve, state
2) shows a certain degree of inhibition. With the increase in the
CTAB concentration to 0.025 mM (red curve, state 3), the fluorescence
quenching is more significantly decreased, accompanying a noticeable
decrease in I1/I3, indicating that pyrene obviously locates not only far from
AuNPs but also in a hydrophobic environment.44 Evidently, the existence of CTAB micelles in this situation (0.025
mM ≪ CMC) is impossible and thus the only available hydrophobic
domain for the location of pyrene is at least not the micelles of
CTAB. We believe that this hydrophobic microenvironment was formed
here by the compact structure of hydrophobic tails of CTAB molecules
adsorbed on the surface of AuNPs. Generally, the long alkyl chain
of CTAB facing toward the aqueous phase is likely in a compact structure,45 making the hydrophobic layer formed by CTAB
alkyl chains dense. In this case, pyrene finds it difficult to enter
the interior of the hydrophobic layer and perches only on the boundary.
Consequently, the probability for pyrene to directly contact the surface
of AuNPs is reduced, strongly decreasing the quenching effect of AuNPs.
However, compared with that of state 3, the fluorescence quenching
of pyrene is visibly enhanced again as the concentration of CTAB reaches
1.5 mM (black curve, corresponding to state 5), but I1/I3 hardly changes. In this
situation, if there were CTAB micelles in the mixture, pyrene would
be gathered into the inner core of the micelles and the chance of
collision between AuNPs and pyrene would be further reduced, which
would cause the fluorescence intensity for state 5 (black curve) to
be higher than that for state 3 (red curve). Obviously, the above
result could not be explained in terms of micelles. We believe that
pyrene located in the double layer of CTAB is more likely to fit well
with the fluorescence spectrum of state 5. In the CTAB interdigitated
palisade layer, pyrene is not only in a hydrophobic domain but also
has a greater movability due to CTAB with the long alkyl chain and
the big head adsorbed on the surface of AuNPs,46 allowing pyrene to approach AuNPs. As a result, the fluorescence
of pyrene in the case of state 5 is more strongly quenched compared
with that in state 3. After all, however, the movability of pyrene
in the palisade layer has a certain limitation; thus, the quenching
effect is relatively mild compared with that in state 1.

Figure 4 (a) Fluorescence
spectra of pyrene (1.629 × 10–8 M) in a series
of mixtures with different ratios of AuNPs to CTAB
as given in the mixture C (AuNPs: 1.50 × 1012 NPs/mL).
(b) Change in the pyrene (0.036 mM) fluorescence spectrum and intensity
(inset) with time for the mixture containing CTAB and AuNPs. CTAB:
1 mM, AuNPs: 1.50 × 1012 NPs/mL.

For the evidence regarding the conversion of CTAB micelles into
the self-assembled bilayer of CTAB on the surface of AuNPs to be acquired,
the mixture D, that is, 1 mL of AuNP solution added into 1 mL of CTAB
solution (2 mM) containing pyrene (0.036 mM), was obtained, and the
change in the fluorescence spectrum of the mixture with time is shown
in Figure 4. In the
mixture, CTAB concentration exceeds CMC (∼0.9 mM), which makes
pyrene concentrate into the micelle of CTAB. As expected, in the results
shown in Figure 4b,
a particularly obvious excimer emission peak centered at 475 nm47 can be observed in the CTAB solution (black
curve). Expectedly, the emission intensity of the excimer dramatically
decreases once AuNPs are added, which might be largely related to
the dilution induced by the addition of AuNPs. Surprisingly, the emission
of the excimer for the CTAB–AuNP mixture increases progressively
with time until 130 min. At this time, the blue-black precipitate
deposits at the bottom of the cuvette, and the supernatant has a stronger
excimer emission (green curve) than CTAB without AuNPs. Obviously,
the above phenomenon implies that the pyrene content located in the
local microdomain constantly increases after CTAB micelles are mixed
with AuNPs. In other words, the CTAB micelles in AuNPs are unstable.

It is worth mentioning that the deposited AuNPs mentioned above
did not turn into a stable suspension even by either forced shaking
or ultrasonic treatment, indicating that a large amount of CTAB in
the supernatant fails to be assembled on the surface of deposited
AuNPs to disperse AuNPs. We suspected that this might be related to
the strong interaction between the high concentration of hydrophobic
pyrene and the hydrophobic palisade layer in CTAB micelles,46 preventing further disintegration of CTAB micelles
for the self-assembly onto the surface of AuNPs. For this conjecture
to be confirmed, the CTAB solutions (1 and 2 mM) without pyrene were
separately added into the above-mentioned aggregated AuNPs, and the
UV–vis absorption spectra of the corresponding mixtures were
recorded. The expected results are shown in Figure 5. For the supernatant, there is no peak in
the UV–vis absorption spectrum (blue curve). However, when
1 or 2 mM of the CTAB solution without pyrene was added into aggregated
AuNP solution, the blue-black precipitated AuNPs immediately returned
to a red stable solution and the obvious peaks at 530 nm (gray curve
and purple curve) appeared, which are similar to the SPR peak of AuNPs.48 These results reveal that the aforementioned
aggregated AuNPs can be dispersed by the addition of a CTAB solution.

Figure 5 UV–vis
spectra of the supernatant of aggregated AuNPs induced
by CTAB and the aggregates suspended in different concentrations of
CTAB. The aggregated AuNPs obtained from the experiment in Figure 4b.

On the basis of the above experimental results, the mechanism
of
the effect of the interaction between CTAB micelles and AuNPs on the
fluorescence behavior of pyrene discussed in Figure 4b was proposed. As shown in Figure 6, by adding the negatively
charged AuNP solution to the CTAB micelle solution, the positively
charged headgroups of CTAB micelles tend to bind to the surface of
AuNPs, causing the gradual disintegration of CTAB micelles and releasing
pyrene from the core of CTAB micelles continuously. Then, the released
pyrene is enriched in the core of free CTAB micelles in the mixture,
enhancing the emission of the excimer due to the increase in the local
pyrene concentration. This process does not stop until the hydrophobic
CTAB monolayer is formed on the surface of AuNPs due to the strong
interaction between the high concentration of hydrophobic pyrene and
the hydrophobic palisade layer in CTAB micelles in the supernatant,
preventing further disintegration of CTAB micelles. Simultaneously,
the assembly of CTAB on the AuNPs not only reduces the absolute value
of the ζ potential of AuNPs but also enhances their hydrophobicity,
which leads to the aggregation of AuNPs. Addition of CTAB solution
into the aggregates of AuNPs loaded with CTAB monolayer can makes
the aggregates redisperse due to formation of mutually repulsive AuNPs
loaded with CTAB bilayer. This mechanism further verifies that the
negatively charged AuNPs could be stabilized through a CTAB bilayer
rather than CTAB micelles.

Figure 6 Proposed mechanism for the effect of the interaction
between CTAB
micelles and AuNPs on the microenvironment of the fluorescence probe
pyrene.

Effect of the Mixing Order
of CTAB and AuNPs on the Aggregation
Behavior of AuNPs
Seemingly, the mixing sequence of a CTAB
solution and a AuNP solution should not affect the final aggregation
behavior of AuNPs. However, this is not the case. When 1 mL of a CTAB
(2 mM) aqueous solution was dropwise added into 1 mL of a AuNP solution
(3 × 1012 NPs/mL), the mixture immediately changed
from red to purple and then to blue and finally a gray precipitate
was formed (process A in Figure 7). However, when the two solutions were mixed in the
opposite order, the mixture first turned from red to purple and then
to a blue color and finally, after standing for a long time, a blue
precipitate was formed (process B in Figure 7). More interestingly, the gray precipitate
generated in process A failed to re-disperse through the further addition
of a CTAB solution and, in contrast, on the further addition of a
CTAB solution into the blue precipitate formed in process B, the mixture
turned to a transparent red solution.

Figure 7 Photos showing the color change in the
solutions formed by (A)
CTAB and (B) AuNPs in different mixing orders and their corresponding
resulted precipitates dispersed in CTAB solutions.

In fact, the above phenomena could be explained in terms
of the
mechanism presented in Figure 3. In the case of the dropwise addition of a CTAB solution
into a AuNP solution, the interaction between CTAB micelles and AuNPs
makes micelles disassemble. For process A in Figure 7, at the beginning, because very few CTAB
micelles are surrounded by too many AuNPs, there is not enough CTAB
to form a protective layer on the surface of AuNPs for decreasing
AuNP aggregation, which is easy to lead to an irreversible coalescence
of red AuNPs to form blue and even gray aggregates. It has been documented
that as AuNPs approach to distances less than ∼0.5 nm, an increasing
electron tunneling current neutralizes the charge separation at the
junction between the spheres and an attractive Coulombic force can
be generated between them to enable full dimer particle convergence
to a single, larger nanoparticle.35Figure 8A indicates the coalescent
AuNPs from the gray precipitate. Clearly, it is impossible to disperse
these coalescent AuNPs through the addition of extra CTAB. However,
in the case of the dropwise addition of a AuNP solution into a CTAB
solution (process B in Figure 7), very few AuNPs are surrounded by too many CTAB micelles
at first and the amount of CTAB is enough to form a perfect bilayer
onto the surface of AuNPs. The resulting CTAB bilayer ensures the
stability of AuNPs. As the amount of AuNPs added into the mixture
increases, the CTAB bilayer formed on the AuNPs is gradually destroyed
to transfer to the surface of the newly added AuNPs until leading
to the formation of the monolayer of CTAB on the surface of each AuNP
in the mixture. At this point, the CTAB monolayer causes a decrease
in the electrostatic repulsion and an increase in the surface hydrophobicity
of AuNPs, finally resulting in the blue aggregates of AuNPs (Figure 8B). Fortunately,
the coalescence between adjacent AuNPs is hindered due to the coverage
of the CTAB monolayer on the surface of AuNPs in this case, and the
CTAB monolayer on the surface of AuNPs can be converted into the CTAB
bilayer by the further addition of CTAB molecules (Figure 7B). Indeed, the irreversible
and reversible aggregations here are similar to the “aggregate”
of AuNPs irreversibly bound together by primary chemical or metallurgical
bonds and the “agglomerate” of AuNPs weakly and reversibly
bound by van der Waals or similar secondary bonds, respectively.49 Apparently, from another aspect, the above experiments
support the variation model for the assembly of CTAB from forming
monolayer to bilayer structures on the surface of the negatively charged
AuNPs with the increase of CTAB.

Conclusions
In
view of the inconsistency regarding the assembly structure of
CTAB on the surface of the negatively charged AuNPs reported in the
literature, the self-assembly structure variation of CTAB on the surface
of AuNPs with the increase of CTAB was systematically investigated.
On the basis of our research results, the following conclusions could
be drawn: (1) For a mixture containing CTAB and a given amount of
AuNPs, with the increase of the CTAB concentration, the color of the
mixture changes from red to blue and then to red. This process corresponds
to a gradual formation of the CTAB monolayer and the bilayer on AuNPs,
accompanying the change in the ζ potential of AuNPs from negative
to zero and then to positive. (2) The self-assembly structure of CTAB
on the surface of AuNPs relies on the relative proportion of CTAB
and AuNPs. The formation of the CTAB bilayer on the surface of AuNPs
has the advantages over that of CTAB micelles. When enough amount
of CTAB exists in the AuNP solution, only after the formation of the
bilayer of CTAB on the surface of AuNPs could the CTAB micelles form
around AuNPs. (3) The mixing sequence of a CTAB solution and a AuNP
solution strongly affects the reversibility of the aggregates formed
by CTAB and AuNPs. The aggregates formed by the gradual addition of
AuNPs into a CTAB solution can be re-dispersed through the further
addition of CTAB, whereas the aggregated AuNPs induced by the dropwise
addition of a CTAB solution into a AuNP solution are difficult to
be re-dispersed.

These findings not only contribute to deepen
the understanding
of the interaction between CTAB and AuNPs but also have valuable references
in applications based on the assembly of CTAB and AuNPs. Additionally,
the fluorescence probe used in this investigation also provides new
insight into the exploration of the interaction between CTAB and AuNPs.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Tetrachloroauric acid (HAuCl4·4H2O, purity ≥99.9%), chlorhydric acid (HCl, AR), and
dichloromethane (AR) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent
Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)
and trisodium citrate (AR) were received from TIANLI Chemical Reagents
Ltd. (Tianjin, China). Pyrene was obtained from Aldrich. All reactants
were used without further purification. Milli-Q water was used in
all of the experiments. All used glassware was treated with aqua regia,
rinsed in Milli-Q water, and oven-dried prior to use.

Synthesis of
Gold Nanoparticles
The citrate-stabilized
AuNPs were prepared via previously reported methods.50 Briefly, 1 mL of aqueous HAuCl4 (25 mM) was
injected into 150 mL of a boiling sodium citrate solution (2.2 mM),
and the solution was kept boiling for 10 min. This led to a series
of color changes from purple to blue, bluish gray, and red, indicating
the formation of citrate-capped AuNPs used as the seed solution (∼10
nm, ∼3 × 1012 NPs/mL). Then, the solution was
cooled down to 90 °C and 2 mL of the obtained solution was taken
out. The final step was the addition of 1 mL of the HAuCl4 solution (25 mM) to the remaining seed solution and keeping the
temperature of the solution constant at a temperature of 90 °C
for 30 min. After the final step was repeated once again, the reaction
was quenched in an ice-water bath. This process produced AuNPs with
a size of ∼20 nm. The concentration of the as-prepared AuNPs
was approximately the same as that of the seed particles (∼3
× 1012 NPs/mL).

Experimental Processes
for the Determination of UV–Vis
Spectra and ζ Potential and for TEM
Preparation of a Mixture
of AuNPs and CTAB with a Concentration
Exceeding CMC
A CTAB solution (2 mL, 0–10 mM) was
well mixed with 2 mL of AuNPs (∼3 × 1012 NPs/mL),
which resulted in a series of AuNPs/CTAB solutions (mixture A).

Preparation of a Mixture of AuNPs and CTAB with a Concentration
below CMC
By introducing 20 μL of AuNPs (∼3
× 1012 NPs/mL) into 2 mL of an aqueous CTAB solution
(0–0.6 mM), the desired AuNPs/CTAB mixtures were obtained (mixture
B).

UV–visible spectra of mixtures A and B were recorded
with a Lambda 35 UV–vis spectrometer (PerkinElmer, Waltham).
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded on a JEM-2100
instrument (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) with an accelerating voltage of 200
kV (20 μL of the sample was dropped onto a carbon-coated Cu
grid and dried in air). Effective surface charges on the surface of
AuNPs (1.5 × 1012 NPs/mL) in the presence of different
contents of CTAB (0, 0.00025, 0.0075, 0.01, 0.025, 1.0, 1.5, 2, 2.5,
5, and 10 mM) were measured using a ζ potential analyzer (Malvern
Instruments Zetasizer, Worcestershire, U.K.). Each sample was measured
three times to obtain an average value. It should be noted that all
of the solutions mentioned above for determination were analyzed immediately
after mixing because of their unstable characteristics.

Recording
Dynamic Color Changes of the AuNPs/CTAB System
A total of
1 mL of 2 mM CTAB was dropwise added into a cuvette containing
1 mL of a AuNP solution (∼3 × 1012 NPs/mL),
and typical color changes at different time intervals were immediately
pictured. Then, this operation was repeated after reversing the mixing
sequence.

Preparation of Mixtures for Recording Fluorescence Spectra
Fluorescence spectra were recorded using an F-7000 fluorescence
spectrometer (Shimadzu, Japan) (excitation wavelength: 340 nm; slit
width: 2.5/2.5 nm; voltage: 700 V).

Preparation of the Mixtures
Containing a Lower Concentration
of Pyrene
CTAB (2 mL) with different concentrations was well
mixed with 2 mL of AuNPs (∼3 × 1012 NPs/mL)
to obtain a series of mixtures (the final concentrations of CTAB:
0, 0.0075, 0.025, and 1.5 mM). Then, 100 μL of a saturated aqueous
solution of pyrene was separately added into the above solutions (the
final concentration of pyrene was 1.629 × 10–8 M) (mixture C), and the mixtures were immediately monitored by fluorescence
spectroscopy with the excitation wavelength of 340 nm.

Preparation
of the Mixtures Containing a Higher Concentration
of Pyrene
A total of 200 μL of a 0.54 mM pyrene solution
(using dichloromethane as the solvent) was taken into a 10 mL beaker,
and then, the beaker was slowly rotated to form a liquid membrane
on its inner wall until the complete evaporation of dichloromethane.
To the beaker coated with pyrene, 3 mL of 2 mM CTAB was added, and
then, the beaker was placed in an ultrasonic bath to be treated for
30 min. The above CTAB solution (1 mL) containing the pyrene probe
(0.036 mM) was mixed with 1 mL of AuNPs (∼3 × 1012 NPs/mL), and the change in the fluorescence spectrum with time was
immediately recorded with the excitation wavelength of 340 nm. Aggregation
accompanying sedimentation took place in the mixture during fluorescence
determination. In this situation, the fluorescence spectra of the
supernatant and suspension were recorded (mixture D).
