Pretargeted
positron emission tomography (PET) imaging based on
the bioorthogonal inverse-electron-demand Diels–Alder reaction
between tetrazines (Tz) and trans-cyclooctenes (TCO)
has emerged as a promising tool for solid tumor imaging, allowing
the use of short-lived radionuclides in immune-PET applications. With
this strategy, it became possible to achieve desirable target-to-background
ratios and at the same time to decrease the radiation burden to nontargeted
tissues because of the fast clearance of small PET probes. Here, we
show the synthesis of novel 18F-labeled dTCO-amide probes
for pretargeted immuno-PET imaging. The PET probes were evaluated
regarding their stability, reactivity toward tetrazine, and pharmacokinetic
profile. [18F]MICA-213 showed an extremely fast kinetic rate (10,553 M–1 s–1 in 50:50 MeOH/water), good stability in saline
and plasma up to 4 h at 37 °C with no isomerization observed,
and the biodistribution in healthy mice revealed a mixed hepatobiliary
and renal clearance with no defluorination and low background in other
tissues. [18F]MICA-213 was further used for in vivo pretargeted immune-PET imaging carried
out in nude mice bearing LS174T colorectal tumors that were previously
treated with a tetrazine-modified anti-TAG-72 monoclonal antibody
(CC49). Pretargeted μPET imaging results showed clear visualization
of the tumor tissue with a significantly higher uptake when compared
to the control.

Introduction
The advances in bioorthogonal
chemistry have provided new possibilities
for noninvasive molecular imaging.1−3 For example, the inverse-electron-demand
Diels–Alder cycloaddition (IEDDA) between trans-cyclooctenes (TCOs) and tetrazines can rapidly generate short-lived
radioisotope probes enabling in vitro and in vivo pretargeting imaging
studies.4−7

The remarkable specificity and affinity of antibodies make
them
extremely attractive vectors for the delivery of diagnostic tools
to biological targets, and represent an interesting platform for in
vitro and in vivo application of bioorthogonal chemistry.8−10 For radio-immunoimaging of solid tumors high tumor-to-nontumor (T/NT)
ratios of radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies are desired as well as
a low radiation burden to the patient. With the bioorthogonal pretargeting
technologies this can be achieved by using a modified mAb (monoclonal
antibody) for a specific target that will later bind to a fast-clearing
radiolabeled probe. This two-step approach will overcome the slow
clearance of antibodies and enhance tumor visualization by clearing
all the nonbound antibodies before injection of the radiotracer.11−13 Using a pretargeting approach will also allow the use of shorter-lived
positron emission tomography (PET) radionuclides such as fluoride-18
(t1/2 = 110 min), that have favorable
properties including its decay mode (97% ß+ emission),
low positron energy (634 keV maximum), and ß+ trajectory
in tissues (<2.3 mm).14

Considerable
research has been devoted to the development of mAb–TCO
conjugates, and their application for pretargeted tumor imaging has
been reported using diverse 18F-labeled tetrazines.15,16 However, it has been shown that TCO has a tendency to isomerize
to cis-cyclooctene (CCO), which is several orders
of magnitude less reactive with tetrazine after prolonged exposure
to physiological conditions.17,18 Until now, the inverse
approach, using mAb–tetrazine and radiolabeled TCO has been
less extensively explored. In 2016, our group reported for the first
time an approach, where tetrazines were used as tags for antibody
modification and TCOs as imaging probes in order to avoid the prolonged
plasma exposure of TCO bound to Abs leading to its deactivation. In
this study, a methyl-tetrazine showed a favorable profile and was
selected for the development of a novel mAb–tetrazine conjugate,
which displayed good stability and reactivity. Furthermore, this immunoconjugate
was used in a pretargeted live-cell fluorescent imaging using a fluorescent
TCO probe resulting in the selective and rapid labeling of cells.
These promising results suggested the viability of this approach and
its translation for in vivo pretargeted PET imaging applications.19

Our group also described the 18F-labeling of a TCO and
its biodistribution. Despite the TCO being able to enter in the brain,
its fast metabolization with nonspecific accumulation in the bone
made its utility limited for pretargeted imaging.20 In 2016, Fox et al. developed a new 18F-labeled
sTCO displaying excellent reactivity in the tetrazine ligation and
showed good stability in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fetal
bovine. The 18F-sTCO conjugated with RGD-tetrazine demonstrated
a prominent tumor uptake in vivo with a good-tumor-to-background contrast.21 In 2017, Bormans et al. described an 18F-labeled version of a dTCO showing good kinetic rates with good
pharmacokinetic properties when compared with the first generation
of TCOs. They have shown a promising starting point using this small
dTCO probe in pretargeted PET imaging, using SKOV-3 tumor-bearing
mice, allowing the visualization of the tumor uptake. However, a slow
isomerization into the corresponding cis-derivative was observed when
incubating this tracer in rat plasma, and also the tumor-to-background
ratio could be improved with further optimization.14,22 More recently, in 2019, Wang, Li, and co-workers reported a new 18F-labeled trans-5-oxocene (oxoTCO) also
used to construct a PET probe for neurotensin receptor imaging, which
presented an improvement in the tumor-to-background ratio while retaining
good tumor uptake.23,24

Despite the recent interest
directed toward the development of
new 18F-labeled small TCO probes, there is a need for improved
TCO structures with higher stability and faster reactivity to be used
in pretargeted PET imaging.

Here, we report the synthesis of
novel dTCO-amide PET probes for
pretargeted imaging based on a new dTCO-amine building block (Figure 1). Modifications
with fluoropyridine and polyethylene glycol (PEG) were made to evaluate
stability, reaction with tetrazine, and pharmacokinetic properties.
The best probe was selected and an in vivo pretargeted immuno-PET
imaging experiment was performed using an LS174T human colorectal
cancer model previously treated with a tetrazine-modified anti-TAG-72
monoclonal antibody (CC49).

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
In order to obtain MICA-212
and MICA-213
cold references (11 and 12, respectively),
the main scaffold of dTCO-amine 7 was synthesized, as
shown in Scheme 1.
Compound 1 (syn-diastereomer) was obtained following
a previous reported procedure.25 Compound 1 was selected as a starting point because, to the best of
our knowledge, dTCO derivatives have shown an improved stability when
compared to other TCO structures and can be easily stored in the fridge
for several months.25 To obtain the main
dTCO-amine scaffold 7, mesylation of 1 was
performed followed by the formation of the azide 3 using
sodium azide under reflux. The azide product was then reduced to amine 4 using LiAlH4 following protection of the amine
group with trifluoroacetic anhydride to afford 5. Photoisomerization
of 5 was performed, under 2.5 h, using a closed-loop
flow reactor26 to afford trans isomer 6 in 53% yield. Compound 6 was then deprotected
with sodium hydroxide under reflux to achieve the dTCO-amine scaffold 7 that showed to be resistant to degradation even at high
temperatures (reflux). To afford MICA-212 cold reference (11), dTCO-amine (7) was first reacted with 4-(chloromethyl)benzoyl
chloride to yield 8 and this was treated with triethyleneglycol
to afford the pegylated compound 9. Compound 10 was obtained by tosylation and then reacted with tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride to afford the desired reference 11. To achieve MICA-213 cold reference (12), a simple
nucleophilic substitution with 6-fluoronicotinoyl chloride was performed.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of dTCO-amide Derivatives
Radiochemistry
[18F]MICA-212 was synthesized by reaction of 10 with
K[18F]F in acetonitrile at 100 °C for 5 min
to afford the radiolabeled product (Scheme 2) in 8.7 ± 0.4% isolated radiochemical
yield (RCY) decay corrected to EOB (end of bombardment) with 98% radiochemical
purity after high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) purification.
[18F]-MICA-213 was produced by first performing a nucleophilic
substitution on compound 7 with 6-chloronicotinoyl chloride
to afford the pyridine-chloride precursor 13 that was
then reacted with K[18F]F in dimethylformamide (DMF) at
130 °C for 5 min to afford the radiolabeled product (Scheme 2) in 5.5 ± 0.5%
isolated RCY (decay corrected to EOB), 98% radiochemical purity after
HPLC purification. The identity of both tracers was confirmed by co-injection
with the nonradiolabeled references 11 and 12. Both radiotracers showed a moderate lipophilicity with a log D value of 1.30 ± 0.03 for [18F]MICA-212 and 1.73 ± 0.01 for [18F]MICA-213. In order
to assess the in vitro stability of the novel dTCO PET probes, we
first incubated the radiotracers in PBS at 37 °C for 2 h. The
radiochemical purity was 94% for [18F]MICA-212 and 95% for [18F]MICA-213. The plasma stability of the
tracers was also evaluated, and after 2 h incubation at 37 °C,
86 ± 1.61% (n = 3) of the intact tracer remained
for [18F]MICA-212 and 79 ± 0.07% (n = 3) for [18F]MICA-213. These results were
very encouraging because the novel PET probes showed improved in vitro
stability when compared with other TCO derivatives reported in the
literature (1% after 30 min;20 74% after
1 h;21 79% after 1 h14).

Scheme 2 Radiosynthesis of [18F]MICA-212 and [18F]MICA-213 by 18F-Labeling
Stopped-Flow Kinetic Analysis
The
success of the pretargeted
approach relies on the speed of the reaction between both components
of the IEDDA reaction, therefore the kinetic rate constants between
the novel dTCO nonradiolabeled tracers and a methyl-tetrazine-NHS19 (Scheme 3) were evaluated by UV-spectrophotometry at 290 nm under pseudo-first
order conditions (Scheme S2). dTCO 11 and 12 were reacted with methyl-tetrazine-NHS
at 37 °C in 50:50 MeOH/H2O with a rate constant of
1064 and 10553 M–1 s–1, respectively
(Table S1). Based on the observed rate
constants, 11 is significantly slower (10-fold less reactive)
than the rate of the dTCO 12. This difference may be
related to the different solubility of compounds because improved
aqueous solubility will have a positive effect on the kinetic rate.
In order to compare our results with the literature, dTCO 12 was reacted with the commercial 3,6-di-2-pyridyl-1,2,4,5-tetrazine
showing a rate constant of 320812 M–1 s–1 at 37 °C in 50:50 MeOH/H2O (Table S1), which is in the same range as the dTCO (366,000
M–1 s–1) reported by Fox et al.,25 and an improvement when comparing to the recently
reported dTCO derivative (1620 M–1 s–1) from Bormans et al.14

Reaction between MICA-213 Cold Reference (12) and Methyl-Tetrazine-NHS

In Vivo μPET Imaging and Biodistribution Studies in Nontumor
Bearing Mice
In order to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile
of the new dTCO PET probes, in vivo dynamic whole-body μPET
imaging in parallel with ex vivo biodistribution was performed. Female
nude BALB/c healthy mice were injected intravenously (iv) with a radiotracer
and organs were collected in different timepoints up to 120 min post
tracer injection, as shown in Figure 2 (Tables S2 and S3). Both
PET tracers showed a similar mixed hepatobiliary and renal clearance
followed by a washout of activity from the kidneys ([18F]MICA-212 11.9 ± 0.7%
ID/g at 15 min and 5.0 ± 1.7% ID/g at 60 min; [18F]MICA-213 14.5 ± 3.2% ID/g
at 10 min and 4.5 ± 0.7% ID/g at 60 min) and liver ([18F]MICA-212 6.3 ± 0.2%
ID/g at 15 min and 3.9 ± 0.9% ID/g at 60 min; [18F]MICA-213 17.1 ± 6.9% ID/g
at 10 min and 2.9 ± 0.4% ID/g at 60 min), which together with
the lack of significant nonspecific accumulation in other organs,
resulted in a general low image background at 60 min p.i. The tracers
showed the absence of in vivo defluorination, with no significant
bone uptake after 60 min p.i. (2.05 ± 0.12% ID/g for [18F]MICA-212, 0.9 ± 0.2%
ID/g for [18F]MICA-213). When comparing both tracers, [18F]MICA-212 showed a higher intestinal uptake than [18F]MICA-213, which
together with a low kidney uptake suggests that it is predominantly
excreted via the gut with the highest accumulation in the large intestines.
Nevertheless, these findings are in accordance with other TCO tracer,
modified with a PEG linker, reported in the literature.14 It was also interesting to observe that [18F]MICA-212 (2.6 ±
0.1% ID/g at 15 min p.i.) and [18F]MICA-213 (3.8 ± 1.7% ID/g at 10 min p.i.) revealed
a brain uptake, and that in the case of [18F]MICA-212 it persists at longer time points (2.6
± 0.5% ID/g at 1 h p.i), which may be due to the presence of
a PEG linker. This observation might encourage the potential use of
these probes for future applications in PET brain imaging.

BALB/c mice [mean ± standard deviation (SD), n = 3].

In Vivo Pretargeted μPET
Imaging in Tumor Bearing Mice
Encouraged by the remarkable
kinetic rate of MICA-213 toward tetrazine
and the favorable pharmacokinetic profile, [18F]MICA-213 was selected for further in
vivo evaluation. In vivo pretargeted μPET imaging together with
ex vivo biodistribution was performed in LS174T tumor-bearing mice
pre-treated with anti-TAG72 mAb CC49 conjugated with a previously
described methyl-tetrazine19 24 h prior
to the injection of [18F]MICA-213. The TAG72 antigen was selected because of its
limited internalization and shedding as well as its overexpression
in a wide range of solid tumors, including colorectal cancer.27 The timepoint tracer injection was selected
based on previously reported studies,10−12 where low levels of
CC49 conjugate are detected in blood after 24 h p.i. The PET imaging
time point was selected based on the [18F]MICA-213 biodistribution results that showed
a low image background at 60 min p.i., as shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Time-activity curves
from 0 to 60 min after iv administration of [18F]MICA-213 (mean ±
SD, n = 4) in healthy BALB/c mice.

The μPET images demonstrated a clear visualization
of the
tumor, as shown in Figure 4B. In accordance with the biodistribution in healthy mice,
the radioactivity in other tissues remained low (≤2.5% ID/g),
with the kidneys (2.3 ± 0.6% ID/g) and liver (1.7 ± 0.3%
ID/g) having the highest uptake because of the mixed hepatobiliary
and renal clearance of the radiotracer. The remaining radioactivity
in the blood is low, suggesting that the [18F]MICA-213 is primarily reacting with
CC49-Tz at the tumor site rather than with mAb that can still be circulating
in the blood. This result suggests that there is no need to introduce
another step where a clearing agent6,28 is injected
prior to administration of the PET probe. To check the specificity
of [18F]MICA-213, a control experiment was performed by first treating the mice with
nonmodified CC49 antibody (200 μg in 200 μL of saline,
4 nmol) and after 24 h were injected with the same dose of the radiotracer
(Figure 4).

Ex Vivo biodistribution
studies on the LS174T tumor-bearing mice
showed a significantly higher tumor uptake of [18F]MICA-213 in mice injected with CC49-Tz
(1.36 ± 0.28% ID/g) than in the control group (0.78 ± 0.24%
ID/g), as shown in Figure 4C. In line with the PET imaging study, some abdominal activity
could be observed which results from the radiotracer clearance.

Conclusions
Pretargeted PET imaging is a promising approach
allowing tumor
visualization with a high target-to-background ratio while sparing
normal tissues from radiation burden. Recently, we have implemented
a new in vitro bioorthogonal IEDDA strategy,19 where a tetrazine molecule is coupled to a specific antibody with
the aim of developing new small TCO-probes for pre-targeted imaging.
Using this approach, one could avoid the prolonged plasma exposure
of TCO bound to Abs which often leads to its deactivation, and also,
having a more hydrophobic-labeled TCO, can bring some interesting
advantages when cell membranes or even the blood–brain-barrier
need to be crossed.

In this work, we developed novel dTCO amide
PET probes for bioorthogonal
pretargeted applications. [18F]MICA-213 was obtained in a total radiosynthesis time
of 50 min with 5% RCY, and >98% radiochemical purity. It demonstrated
a promising stability and high reactivity against tetrazine moieties
and showed a favorable pharmacokinetic profile in healthy mice with
a fast clearance and no defluorination observed. In a pretargeted
PET imaging setting, using a colorectal adenocarcinoma model treated
with a tetrazine-modified CC49 antibody 24 h prior to radiotracer
injection, [18F]MICA-213 allowed visualization of the tumor with a significantly higher uptake
compared to the control.

Additional optimization can be done
based on the dTCO-amine scaffold
to reduce background radiation and enhance tumor uptake in pretargeted
imaging applications. Furthermore, the brain uptake, demonstrated
within the first minutes of PET biodistribution, suggest potential
application of small hydrophobic 18F-labeled PET probes
for imaging of brain targets or internalizing targets.

Materials and
Methods
General
All chemicals and reagents were purchased from
commercial suppliers (Sigma-Aldrich, Acros, TCI-Europe, Tractus or
BioRad) and used without further purification. All solvents were reagent-grade
or higher and used without further purification. PBS (0.01 M, pH 7.4)
solutions were obtained from diluting of a 0.5 M stock purchased from
Gentest Life technology.

NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker
AVANCE DRX 400 MHz spectrometer. 1H and 13C
spectra are referenced to residual solvent peaks, coupling constants
are given in Hz. HRMS analysis was performed using a Q-TOF II instrument
(Waters, Manchester, UK). Ultra performance liquid chromatography–mass
spectrometry analyses were performed on a Waters acquity UPLC system
coupled to a Waters TQD ESI mass spectrometer and TUV detector. Kinetics,
UV–vis measurements were performed on a stopped-flow system.
All data obtained from kinetic and UV–vis measurements were
analyzed with a GraphPad Prism 6 (San Diego, CA).

Chromatographic
purifications were performed with a Biotage Isolera
One flash system equipped with an internal variable dual-wavelength
diode array detector (200–400 nm). Preparative HPLC used in
the synthesis was performed on a Waters 2545 HPLC equipped with a
Waters 2998 diode array detector, a Micromass Quattro microTM model,
a Waters 2767 fraction collector, and a XBridge Prep 5 μm RPC18
column at a flow rate of 16 mL/min.

Radiochemistry
The radiosynthesis was carried out in
an automated synthesis module (FluorSynthon III, Comecer Netherlands).
No-carrier added aqueous [18F] fluoride was produced in
an Eclipse HP cyclotron (Siemens) using the 18O(p,n)18F reaction by proton bombardment of [18O]H2O (Rotem Industries), and passed through an ion exchange resin
(Sep-Pak Accell Plus QMA Light cartridge (Waters)). [18F]F– was eluted from the resin in the reactor vial
with 1 mL of a mixture of 0.03 M K2CO3/0.07
M Kryptofix2.2.2 in CH3CN/H2O (95:5 (v/v)),
and evaporated to dryness. The remaining traces of water were removed
by azeotropic distillation using CH3CN. For [18F]MICA-212, tosylate precursor
solution (5 mg) in dry ACN was added and reacted for 5 min at 90 °C
and for [18F]MICA-213, the chloro-pyridine precursor solution (5 mg) in dry DMF was added,
and reacted for 5 min at 130 °C. After cooling down to 80 °C,
1 mL of buffer was added and the mixture was passed through a Sep-Pak
Alumina N Light cartridge (Waters) (preconditioned with 10 mL of water),
before injection on the HPLC. [18F]MICA-212 was purified using a Phenomenex Luna C18
250 × 10 mm (5 μm) HPLC column using a mobile phase of
NaOAc 0.05 M pH 5.5/EtOH (55:45 (v/v)) at a flow rate of 4 mL/min.
([18F]MICA-212Rt = 17.5 min). [18F]MICA-213 was purified using a Grace Platinum
EPS C18 150 × 10 mm (5μ) HPLC column with a mobile phase
NaOAc 0.05 M pH 5.5/EtOH (65:35 v/v) at a flow rate of 4 mL/min ([18F]MICA-213Rt = 12.5 min). Radiotracers were sterile-filtered
and diluted with 0.9% NaCl to reduce the ethanol concentration <10%
in the final formulation. Radiochemical purity was determined by analytical
reverse-phase HPLC using a Waters XBridge C18 150 × 4.6 mm (5μ)
HPLC column for [18F]MICA-212 with an isocratic elution of NaOAc 0.05 M pH 5.5/ACN (68:32 v/v)
over 25 min, with a flow rate of 1 mL/min; and a Phenomenex Kinetex
EVO C18 150 × 4.6 mm (5μ) for [18F]MICA-213 with an isocratic elution
of NaOAc 0.05 M pH 5.5/ACN (75:25 v/v) over 20 min, with a flow rate
of 1 mL/min. The recorded data were processed by the GINA-Star 5 software
(Raytest). RCYs were calculated from the theoretical initial amount
of [18F]F– and decay corrected to EOB.

CC49 Antibody Modification with Tetrazine-NHS
A CC49
solution (2 mg from a 5 mg/mL solution) reacted with methyl-tetrazine-NHS19 (30 equiv, 4.8 μL in dimethyl sulfoxide)
in a total volume of 500 μL PBS. Sodium carbonate buffer (1
M) was used to adjust the pH to 9, and the reaction was carried out
for 45 min at RT in the dark. The purification of the conjugate was
performed via size exclusion chromatography (PD-10 column) and concentrated
using vivaspin2 centrifuge tubes in order to be stored in PBS at 4
°C. To determine the tetrazine loading into the antibody, MS
using a Q-TOF instrument was used providing an average of 8 tetrazine
molecules per antibody (Figure S2), as
previously described.19

Partition Coefficient
Determination
The partition coefficient
(log D) of [18F]MICA-212 and [18F]MICA-213 was experimentally determined using the “shake-flask”
method.29 In this method, the radiotracer
(74 kBq) was added to a 1:1 mixture of n-octanol
and PBS (0.01 M, pH 7.4). After, the mixture was shaken, vortexed
(2 min), and centrifuged (3000 rpm, 10 min), the layers were allowed
for separation. Then, an aliquot of each layer (0.5 mL) was taken
into separate tubes and radioactivity was measured using an automatic
gamma- (γ) counter (Wizard2 2480, PerkinElmer). The
values obtained for log D were calculated by dividing
the octanol containing radioactivity by the PBS containing radioactivity
and finally the log10 of this ratio was calculated. The log D values were determined in triplicate and were reported
as mean ± SD.

Stopped-Flow Kinetic Analysis
The
second order rate
constant between dTCOs and the tetrazines was measured under pseudo-first
order conditions (solutions in water/methanol 45:55) by following
the exponential decay of absorbance of the tetrazine (298 nm) using
an SX 18MV-R stopped-flow spectrophotometer (Applied Photophysics
Ltd.). Equal volumes of dTCOs (0.5, 1, 2 and 3 mM) and tetrazines
solutions (0.05 mM) were thermostatted in the syringes and were mixed
in the stopped-flow device. A total of 400 data points were recorded
over a period of 3 s, and performed in quadruplicate at 298 K. The kobs was determined by nonlinear regression analysis of the data points
using GraphPad Prism software (v. 6.00, GraphPad Software Inc.).

Animal Experiments
Animals were kept under a temperature-controlled
environment (12 h light/dark cycle, 20–24 °C and 40–70%
relative humidity) in IVC cages with food and water ad libitum. The
human colon cancer cell line LS174T (ATCC CL-188) was obtained from
the ATCC and maintained in Eagle’s Minimal Essential Medium
(Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM l-glutamine,
1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 1% penicillin–streptomycin (Invitrogen)
at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Tumor-free or tumor-bearing female nude
BALB/c mice (20–25 g, Charles River Laboratories) were inoculated
subcutaneously with 5 × 106 LS174T cells in 100 μL
of sterile PBS and were used 7–10 days after tumor inoculation.
The tumors reached a size of approximately 70–200 mm3. At the end of each experiment, the mice were euthanized by cervical
dislocation. Experimental procedures and protocols were performed
in accordance with European Directive 86/609/EEC Welfare and Treatment
of Animals and were approved by the local ethical commission (2017-10,
University of Antwerp, Belgium).

In Vivo μPET Imaging
Studies
Pretargeted PET
imaging studies in healthy mice (n = 4) and LS174T
tumor-bearing mice (n = 5) were performed by iv injection
via the lateral tail vein with 7.4 MBq of [18F]MICA-213. Acquisition data of the dynamic
whole-body PET scans were acquired during 60 min (12 × 10, 3
× 20, 3 × 30, 3 × 60, 3 × 150, and 9 × 300
s frames) for healthy mice and static whole-body PET images 60 min
p.i. for LS174T tumor-bearing mice, using an Inveon small animal PET-CT
scanner (Siemens). After each PET acquisition, a whole-body CT scan
was performed to obtain anatomic information. During the PET-CT scanning,
mice body temperature was maintained using a heating pad. For quantitative
analysis, PET data were reconstructed using 3-dimensional ordered
subset expectation maximization (OSEM3D, 16 subsets and 2 iterations)
and 18 maximum a posteriori iterations including scatter and attenuation
correction. The PET images were additionally reconstructed on a 128
× 128 × 159 matrix with a voxel size of 0.776 × 0.776
× 0.776 mm. Corrections to the PET data were applied using a
CT-based attenuation and single scatter stimulation scatter. For the
dynamic scans, time activity curves for the liver, kidney, urinary
bladder, muscle, brain, and bone were generated using PMOD (version
3.6; PMOD Technologies). For an absolute measure of the tracer uptake
in the tissue, normalized images were scaled according to the percent-injected
dose (% ID/mL = tissue uptake from the scanner [kBq/mL]/injected dose
[kBq] × 100).

Ex Vivo Biodistribution Studies
Healthy mice and LST174
tumor-bearing mice were injected with [18F]MICA-212 (7.4 MBq per mouse, n = 3/time point) and [18F]MICA-213 (7.4 MBq per mouse, n = 3/time
point) via the lateral tail vein. At selected time points (15, 30,
60, or 120 min) blood was collected and mice were euthanized by cervical
dislocation. Organs and tissues of interest were harvested, weighed,
and blotted dry. The sample radioactivity was counted in a γ-counter
(Wizard2 2480, PerkinElmer) and the uptake of the radiotracer
are presented as the injected dose per gram (% ID/g).

In Vitro Stability
Evaluation
The in vitro stability
was assessed by incubation of [18F]MICA-212 and [18F]MICA-213 in PBS (0.01 M, pH 7.4) or mouse plasma at
37 °C for up to 2 h. Both radiotracers (185–370 kBq) were
incubated in 100 μL of PBS or mouse plasma and, at selected
time points, quenched by adding ACN (100 μL), followed by vortexing
and centrifugation (5 min, 4000g) to remove the proteins.
For each sample and time point, the radioactive supernatant (100 μL)
was analyzed by analytical radio-HPLC. The HPLC eluate was collected
in fractions of 30 s, and the radioactivity was counted in an automated
γ-counter.

Data Analysis
The data are expressed
as a mean ±
SD. Statistical analysis was performed using Prism (version 6.01;
GraphPad Software). Statistical significance between different groups
were analyzed by the one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni
correction. Statistical significance between two data sets was evaluated
by the unpaired two-tailed Student t-test. The difference
between groups was considered statistically significant when p < 0.05.
