Designing
a fluorogenic probe for the determination of Pd2+ is a
challenging analytical task. Pd2+ is a potentially
toxic and harmful substance even at a very low level of contamination
in the end product. Herein, a promising spirolactam-functionalized
chemosensor, rhodamine-appended benzophenone (HBR), is designed and
characterized by spectroscopic (1H NMR, 13C
NMR, ESI-MS, and FT-IR) data along with the single-crystal X-ray diffraction
technique. It acts as a highly sensitive and selective fluorogenic
chemosensor for Pd2+ ions over other environmentally relevant
cations in aqueous ethanol (1:1, v/v) at pH 7.4. The limit of detection
(LOD) is 34 nM that is far below the WHO recommended Pd uptake (47
μM). The plausible mechanism involves the specific binding of
HBR with Pd2+ and the formation of 1:1 stoichiometry of
the complex, which has been supported by ESI-MS, FT-IR data, Job plot,
and association constant data (Benesi–Hildebrand plot). The
computation study has been attempted to explain the ring cleavage
fluorescence enhancement scheme of HBR upon binding with Pd2+. Furthermore, this “turn-on” probe has successfully
applied to image the Pd2+ ion in cultured MDA-MB-231 cells.

Introduction
In the past few years,
rhodamine-based probes have attracted tremendous
interest recently due to their excellent photophysical properties
such as impressive quantum yields, high extinction coefficients, great
photostability, etc. where the signal transduction mechanism involves
the transformation of the lactonized form (fluorescence-off mode)
to the delactonized form (fluorescence-on mode) by binding to some
specific metal ions especially to Pd2+ ions.1 In this aspect, optical detection techniques
(colorimetric and fluorometric) with appropriate probes are more effective
for sensing of Pd2+ ions due to their sensitivity, simplicity,
and nondestructive nature. Several rhodamine-based receptors were
reported in literature for sensing of mercury,2,3 copper,4 zinc,5 cadmium,6 chromium,7 iron,8 aluminum,9 and also
for palladium.10,11 However, researchers are interested
to develop a convenient and efficient method to detect Pd2+ ions in the presence of other cations.11 Hence, the specific and rapid detection of the potentially toxic
heavy cations (such as lead, cadmium, mercury, palladium, etc.) is
important due to their lethal impact on the ecosystem and human health.
These ions enter into our body via contaminated foods, drinks, beverages,
medicines, etc.12,13 In this regard, the Pd2+ ion is considered to be a highly dangerous substance because of
its binding with −SH groups of different enzymes like kinase,
carbonic anhydrase, aldolase, creatine, succinate dehydrogenase, alkaline
phosphatase, and prolyl hydroxylase to dysfunction the enzymatic process.14 Palladium has also severe effects on DNA, proteins,
and other macromolecules, such as vitamin B6, etc.15 The WHO permissible limit of palladium is 5–10
ppm (5–10 ppm equals to 46.98–93.97 μM), and the
maximum dietary intake value is ∼1.5–15 μg/day/person
(∼1.5–15 μg equals to 14–140 nM).16,17 Therefore, it is very urgent to develop an efficient, technically
simple, cheap, and trustworthy technique for quantitative estimation
of the trace quantity of Pd+2 ions both in the living cells
and environment. Other methods for the detection of Pd+2 ions including XRF (X-ray fluorescence), ICP-AES (inductively coupled
plasma atomic emission spectroscopy), FAAS (flame atomic absorption
spectrometry), AAS (atomic absorption spectrometry), ICP-MS (inductively
coupled plasma mass spectrometry), and SPME-HPLC (solid-phase microextraction
coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography)18,19 often necessitate costly, sophisticated instrumentation, and time
consuming sample preparation steps. In this aspect, optical detection
techniques (colorimetric and fluorometric) with appropriate probes
are more effective for sensing of Pd+2 ions. In this work,
we have synthesized an ethylenediamine-bridged 2-hydroxy benzophenone-rhodamine-B
dyad (HBR), which acts as a fluorogenic sensor and capable of detecting
Pd2+ ions with the naked eye. The response is very fast
and the detection limit is reasonably very low (34 nM). The compound
HBR has been verified by spectroscopic data (1H NMR, 13C NMR, mass, and FT-IR spectroscopies) and X-ray single-crystal
data. The practical application of the probe HBR has been examined
in the MDA-MB-231 cell for the detection of exogenous Pd2+ ions by fluorescence cell imaging processes. Sensing ability has
been studied by both absorption and fluorescence techniques.

Results
and Discussion
Formulation of Probe HBR
The chemosensor
(HBR) has
been synthesized from ethylenediamine derivatives of rhodamine B and
2-hydroxy benzophenone (Figure S1, Scheme 1) and characterized
by spectroscopic (FT-IR,1HNMR,13CNMR, and ESI-MS) data and by the single-crystal X-ray diffraction
technique (Figures S2, S3, S5, and S7).
A suitable single crystal is obtained by slow evaporation of methanol
solution of HBR for a week. HBR crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal
system with the P21/c space group
and Z = 4. The structure of HBR (Figure 1) indicates the formation of
the unique cyclic lactam ring (fluorescence-off mode) from the condensation
of acid chloride and ethylene diamine molecules. Two planes of the
cyclic lactam ring in the HBR probe are attached in an appropriately
vertical position (δΔ = 2.13°). Other aromatic rings
are more or less planar with either the pyran ring (maximum deviation
4.75°) or the pyrrol-2-one ring (deviation 0.85°). Thus,
the structural distortion is more or less close to the reported rhodamine
derivatives.20 In the molecular assembly,
the H-bonding performs the pivotal role during the generation of the
supramolecular assembly (Figure 2b). Here, both intermolecular and intramolecular types
of hydrogen bonding are present. The intramolecular hydrogen bonding
is in between O–H (O3–H3) and the N (N6) atom (H···N,
1.84 Å; angle O–H···N, 144°), which
is classical in nature. Similarly, there is a nonclassical hydrogen
bonding in between the C–H (C68···H68A) moiety
and the O (O4) atom (H···O, 2.52 Å; angle C–H···O,
102°). The intermolecular hydrogen bonding is (C46–H46···O2,
C59–H59C··· O6) in the range of 2.58–3.44
Å. In the structural architecture, there are some allowable C–H···π
(2.76–2.96 Å) and π···π (3.817(5)
to 3.820(6) Å) interactions, which improve the stability of aggregated
motifs (Figure 2c).
As far as we could possibly know, only a few crystal structures of
the rhodamine spirolactam moiety have been reported.21

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Probe HBR
Absorption Spectroscopic Studies
The sensor, HBR, is
colorless and reveals almost no absorbance beyond 400 nm, which is
mainly due to its spirolactam structure.22 A specific signal of the tertiary C atom at ∼64.8 ppm in
the 13C NMR spectrum23 and the
structure of single crystal for HBR also characterized its spirolactam
form. However, upon the gradual addition of Pd2+ ions (0–25
μM) in aqueous ethanolic solution (v/v, 1:1) of HBR at pH 7.4,
a significant enhancement in absorbance at 572 nm is observed and
is increasing progressively (Figure 3). This is accompanied by an obvious color change from
colorless to pink and is signifying the ring-opening of the spirolactam
form of HBR to specific binding of Pd2+ions. Moreover,
the same absorption experiment has been performed with other common
metal ions (K+, Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Ba2+, Mn2+, Al+3, Co2+, Ni2+, Pb2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Tb3+, Eu3+, Gd3+, Sm3+, Cr3+, Ag+, Hg2+, Cu2+, Sn4+, Ru3+, Pt2+, and Rh3+), and no perceptible
spectral change is observed (Figure 4). Further, these metal ions are found to be noninterfering
to the response of Pd2+ ions. Therefore, the color change
of HBR with the addition of Pd2+ ions can be visualized
clearly by the naked eye. This is an exciting feature by which we
can easily detect Pd2+ions without using high-value sophisticated
instrumental methods.

aqueous ethanolic
solution (v/v, 1:1) at pH 7.4 (HEPES buffer) upon addition of Pd2+ ion (0–25 μM). Inset: changes of absorption
intensity at 572 nm with incremental addition of Pd2+ ions
and photographic images of HBR and [BR––Pd2+]+.

of HBR (20 μM) alone and in presence
of different metal ions in aqueous ethanolic solution (v/v, 1:1) at
pH 7.4 (HEPES buffer) [Pd2+] = 25 μM, [other ions]
≈ 10–4 M.

Fluorescence Property and Binding Behavior
The fluorescence
measurements are performed at the maximum excitation wavelength of
572 nm and also to reveal the nature of binding ability of the probe
HBR. Fluorescence titrations of chemosensors with Pd2+ have
been carried out using 2 mL of 20 μM of HBR in aqueous ethanolic
solution (v/v, 1:1) at pH 7.4 (HEPES buffer). As shown in Figure 5, the emission intensity
of the solution has significantly changed at 595 nm with the gradual
addition of Pd2+ ions (0–25 μM), along with
a visual emission color change from colorless to pink under a UV lamp.
The significant increase in the emission intensity upon the addition
of Pd2+ ions reports the binding of the ion with the probe
and initiates the “off–on” switching mechanism.
This may be due to the structural change of the sensor, HBR, from
nonluminescent spirocyclic forms to the luminescent noncyclic forms
as shown in Scheme 2. The luminescence change of HBR to specific binding of Pd2+ ions is analyzed from 0 to 1.2 equivalents (Figure 5). In addition, the sensing behavior of HBR
has been investigated by adding several metal ions (K+,
Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Ba2+,
Mn2+, Al+3 Co2+, Ni2+,
Pb2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Tb3+, Eu3+, Gd3+, Sm3+, Cr3+, Ag+, Hg2+, Cu2+, Sn4+, Ru3+, Pt2+, and Rh3+) to the EtOH/H2O (v/v, 1:1) solution
of HBR at pH 7.4 (10 mM, HEPES buffer). As displayed in Figure 6, only Pd+2 induces
a strong fluorescent enhancement at 595 nm, whereas other metal ions
do not show any noticeable spectral change. Additionally, competitive
experiments are carried out by adding several metal ions to the aqueous
ethanolic solution of the sensor HBR in the presence of Pd2+ ions (Figure S14), and the results have
shown that the Pd2+ ion has induced fluorescence enhancement
and is not affected by the competitive ions. The observation is clearly
demonstrating the excellent selectivity of HBR for sensing Pd2+ at biological conditions (pH = 7.4).

Enhancement of Probe HBR and Change of Emission Spectra Strategy of
Probe (HBR)
Effect of pH
The
sensor, HBR, alone does not show any
fluorescence spectra at pH 7.4, which indicates the nonluminescent
lactam form. Fluorescence spectra were recorded for HBR (20 μM)
at different pH solutions, and the result of such experiment demonstrated
that the change from spirocyclic to ring opening of the rhodamine
moiety in HBR alone could happen only for pH ≤ 5.0 (Figure 7) due to the strong
protonation. However, the addition of Pd2+ led to the fluorescence
diminishment over a comparatively wide pH range (8.0–12.0),
which may be attributed to the formation of Pd(OH)2. This
affirms that the fluorescence response at ∼595 nm is only due
to the selectivity of the sensor HBR to Pd2+ ions in approximately
physiological pH ranges.

Figure 7 Effect of pH on the emission activity of HBR
and HBR with Pd2+ ions in aqueous ethanolic solution (v/v,
1:1) at pH 7.4
(HEPES buffer).

The reversibility is a significant
feature of any probes to be
used as a chemosensor for practical application. The reversibility
is tested by adding an aqueous solution of KSCN (c = 2 × 10–4 M) to the pink colored Pd2+-complex (c = 2 × 10–5 M) solution. The solution color turned from pink to colorless, and
fluorescence is quenched gradually in the presence of excess KSCN
as shown in Figure 8 (Scheme 2), which
may be due to the formation of Pd(SCN)2 and HBR.

the emission spectra of the Pd2+ complex
(c = 2.0 × 10–5 M) in presence
of excess aqueous solution of KSCN (c = 2.0 ×
10–4 M).

In Vitro Detection of Pd2+ Ions
All the
above chemical and spectroscopic properties of HBR show that HBR specifically
binds with Pd2+ ions in the presence of other metal ions.
The exposure of different heavy metal ions has an immense effect to
induce several devastating diseases in the human body. Among the heavy
metals, Pd2+ has a major role in the occurrence and progression
of cardiovascular disorders as well as cancer. Therefore, the selective
detection of Pd2+ in the cell through a highly sensitive
analytical method is a very demanding and challenging area of research.
Toward this objective, an experiment has been modeled to examine the
presence of Pd2+ in living cells using the HBR and MDA-MB-231
cell lines. The toxicity of HBR in MDA-MB-231 cell lines is checked
in different concentrations up to 100 μM through the MTT assay
(Figure 9). After 24
h treatment of HBR, the cell viability is decreased with the increase
in drug concentrations. This result suggests that this compound shows
slight toxicity in this cancer cell line, which might be considered
as an anticancer compound.

Figure 9 Cell viability test estimated by MTT assay with
HBR to the media.

The ability of HBR for
selective binding of Pd2+ ions
in the living cell model is tested using MDA-MB-231 cell lines. Above,
the spectroscopic study indicated that after binding with Pd2+, HBR showed emission in the visible range. Therefore, we used the
microscopic technique to visualize the Pd2+ by adding HBR.
The cells were treated with Pd2+ ions (5 μM) along
with HBR. After 4 h treatment, the cells were fixed and captured the
images of cellular morphology under a microscope in the red channel.
The images showed the red fluorescence in the cell body, which further
supports the metal chelating property of HBR (Figure 10). Therefore, it may be concluded that HBR
can be used to identify the presence of Pd2+ in cells.
Both the spectroscopic study and cellular images showed that HBR specifically
bonded Pd2+ ions and might be used to capture Pd2+ ions.

Density Functional Theory Calculation
The crystallographic
parameters of HBR are used to optimize the structure and proposed
complex (Figures S12 and S13), which are
compared with analogous coordination environment. Also, the identity
of structure has been confirmed by vibrational frequency calculation
of selected functions and on relating with experimental spectra. The
DFT-optimized geometry of the complex with the Pd2+ ion
is a distorted square planar where HBR coordinates to Pd2+ through O, N, N, and O centers. The calculated Pd–O (benzophenone),
Pd–N (imine), Pd–N (rhodamine), and Pd–O (rhodamine)
distances are 2.00, 1.98, 1.96, and 2.47 Å, respectively, and
they are comparable with the analogous reported structure.22,24 Owing to the coordination, the distances C–O (spirolactam)
are elongated from 1.25 to 1.31 Å, and C=N (imine) is
extended from 1.29 to 1.32 Å (Tables S2 and S3). Upon specific chelation of Pd2+ ions to HBR,
the HOMO and LUMO energy gaps have been decreased as compare to that
of free HBR. The HOMO–LUMO energy gap in HBR is 3.73 eV (332
nm), while that in the complex [BR––Pd2+]+, it is 2.38 eV (521 nm). These are in close
agreement to the observed longest wavelength absorption band of HBR
and [BR––Pd2+]+, respectively
(Figure 11). The fractional
contribution of different components of orbitals is depicted, and
qualitative molecular orbital concepts are also obtained.

Figure 11 HOMO–LUMO
distributions of probe HBR and [BR––Pd2+]+ complex.

Proposed Binding Mode of HBR with Pd2+
The
changes in absorption spectra took place up to the 1:1 {[Pd2+]/[HBR]} ratio, which shows the formation of the complex of [BR––Pd2+]+. This [Pd2+]/[HBR] ratio is confirmed by the Job plot analysis (Figure S11). The ESI-MS data show m/zobsd = 769.2051, where the m/zcalcd for [BR––Pd2+]+ is 769.2364 (Figure S6). The observed peak has provided the additional
support for the 1:1 complex formation of [BR––Pd2+]+. The association constant (Kassoc) has been found to be 1.99 × 104 M–1 from the Benesi–Hildebrand plot obtained
by using data available from systematic emission spectral titrations
(Figure S10).29 The binding of HBR to Pd2+ through the oxygen of −OH
via deprotonation, the oxygen of C=O′ in γ-lactam,
nitrogens of C=N (Schiff base), and C–N via spirolactam
ring opening was suggested, which is consistent with FT-IR spectra
(Figures S7 and S8) because a broad peak
at 3412 cm–1 for −OH (HBR) disappeared, shifting
of stretching frequencies of “C=O” from 1690
to 1680.5 cm–1, C=N (Schiff base) remains
unchanged and C–N from 1514 to 1585 cm–1 respectively
in the complex, [BR––Pd2+]+. The plausible sensing mechanism has also been supported
by the 1H NMR spectrum of the complex, [BR––Pd2+]+. The disappearance of the phenolic–OH
peak (δ = 14.80 ppm, s) and downfield shifts of a, b, c, and
d protons of HBR clearly indicate that Pd2+ induces the
formation of a delocalized xanthene moiety of rhodamine B (Figures S2 and S4).

Conclusions
A
rhodamine spirolactam-based dyad, 2-hydroxy benzophenone-rhodamine
(HBR), has been synthesized, which served as an effective “turn-on”
fluorescent and a colorimetric probe for Pd2+ ions in mixed
ethanol-aqueous media over 26 other tested metal ions with a very
low detection limit of 34 nM. Addition of Pd2+ ions to
the sensor has enhanced the emission intensity by 53-fold through
the ring opening of the spirolactam form of the rhodamine moiety.
The recognition events have been effectively used to the bioimaging
of Pd2+ ions in the intracellular level of breast cancer
cell lines in the physiological medium.

Experimental Section
Materials
and Methods
Unless otherwise noted, all the
solvents and inorganic salts were purchased from Spectrochem. Rhodamine
B, 2-hydroxy benzophenone, and ethylenediamine were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich. All reactions were monitored by thin layer chromatography
(TLC) plates. Column chromatography was done by using silica gel (60–120
mesh). All metal salts were used as either their nitrate or chloride
salts. Aqueous solutions for spectroscopic measurement were prepared
using Milli-Q water (Millipore).1H and 13C NMR
spectra were taken on a 400 MHz spectrometer [Bruker(AC)] in CDCl3 where the internal reference was tetramethylsilane (TMS).
ESI mass spectra were collected from a water HRMS model XEVO-G2QTOF#YCA351
spectrometer. Fluorescence and UV–vis spectrum measurements
were performed on a Perkin Elmer spectrofluorimeter model LS55 and
a Perkin Elmer Lambda 25 spectrophotometer, respectively. FT-IR spectra
(KBr disk, 4000–400 cm–1) were acquired on
a Perkin Elmer LX-1FTIR spectrophotometer. The fluorescence quantum
yield was calculated using fluorescein as a reference with a known
quantum yield (ϕR = 0.52 in 0.1 M NaOH).25

The quantum yield was calculated by using
the following the equation:  where ηs is the fluorescence
quantum yield of the samples, ηR is the fluorescence
quantum yield of the reference, As is
respective areas under emission spectra of the sample, AR = respective areas under emission spectra of the reference,
(Abs)R is the absorbance of the sample at the excitation
wavelength, (Abs)s is the absorbance of the reference at
the excitation wavelength, ηs2 is the
refractive index of the solvent, and ηR2 is the refractive index of the solvent used for the reference.

Synthesis of 2-Hydroxy Benzophenone-Rhodamine (HBR)
The
sensor (HBR) was achieved according to Figure S1 and Scheme 1. The ethylenediamine derivative of rhodamine
B (1) was synthesized by refluxing rhodamine B with POCl3 followed by ethelenediamine. A mixture of the compound 1 (1.0 equiv) and 2-hydroxy benzophenone (1.0 equiv) was refluxed
for 4 h in dry ethanol (10 mL) under inert atmosphere. After cooling
to ambient temperature, the solvent was evaporated and the obtained
residue was purified by silica column chromatography using ethyl acetate/petroleum
ether (1:5, v/v) as an eluent to afford a yellow solid of the compound
HBR in 85% yield. mp: 158 °C, IR. Bands: 3412, 2974, 2938, 1690,

Preparation of Solutions
Stock solutions
of HBR (20
× 10–6 M) for electronic absorption and fluorescence
measurements were prepared in aqueous ethanolic solution (v/v, 1:1)
at pH 7.4 buffered with HEPES. Stock solutions of the several metal
ions (K+, Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Ba2+, Mn2+, Al+3 Co2+, Ni2+, Pb2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Tb3+, Eu3+, Gd3+, Sm3+, Cr3+, Ag+, Hg2+, Cu2+, Sn4+, Ru3+, Pd+2, Pt2+, and Rh3+) were prepared
by dissolving their chloride or nitrate salts in EtOH (1 mM). For
UV–vis and fluorescence titration studies, HBR solution was
taken in a 2 mL cuvette by the gradual addition of the corresponding
metal ion with the help of a micropipette at room temperature.

X-Ray
Measurement
The crystal structure of the organic
compound was determined by a single-crystal X-ray diffraction method.
A prismatic yellow-colored single crystal having an appropriate dimension
(0.16 × 0.06 × 0.01 mm) was picked up with nylon loops and
mounted for data collection via a Bruker SMART APEX II diffractometer,
having graphite-monochromated Mo Kα radiation (λ, 0.71073
Å). Unit cell parameters and experimental details during the
crystal data collection and structure refinement are briefly reported
in Table S1.The unit cell parameters and
crystal-orientation matrices were determined by least-square refinement
of all reflections within the hkl range −11 < h < 14,
−15 < k < 15, −49 < l < 49. The intensity
data of single crystal were enhanced for Lorentz and polarization
effects.26 Crystal data of the organic
compound were collected applying the condition I > 2σ (I). The collected data of the above compound
were integrated using SAINT program, and the absorption correction
was made with SADABS. Full-matrix least-square refinements on F2 of the data were carried out using SHELXL-9727 with anisotropic displacement parameters for
all nonhydrogen atoms. Hydrogen atoms present in the organic molecule
were placed in their geometrically idealized positions to constrain
their parent atoms. The refinement shows high alert levels, which
are not monitored by crystal solution software. We have tried further
to get good quality crystals but failed. The crystallinity of the
compound is not good; however, we have chosen the best single crystal
among them. The presence of alerts may be due to the presence of a
huge number of collective atoms with their partial occupancy and highly
disordered ring systems. The quality of the crystal data may be improved
by using lower temperature data collection, but currently, the scope
is not available in our institute.

Computational Method
All calculations of HBR and proposed
complex were performed at the B3LYP28 level
using the Gaussian 09 software29 package.
The X-ray coordinates of HBR were used to generate an optimize structure.
The lanl2dz basis set was assigned for the elements. All the ground
state (S0) stationary points were fully
optimized at the B3LYP/lanl2dz and the excited states at the TD-B3LYP/lanl2dz
method.30 Frequency verification vertical
electronic excitations based on B3LYP-optimized geometries were calculated
using the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) formalism31in methanol using the conductor-like polarizable
continuum model (CPCM).32 GaussSum33 was used to estimate the fractional contributions
of various groups to each molecular orbital.

Cell Viability Assay
Cell viability assay was performed
in MDA-MB-231 cell lines. MDA-MB cell lines were procured from NCCS
Pune, India. The DMEM media with 10 % fetal bovine serum was used
to culture cells. Cells were seeded in 96-well plate (density 10,000
cells per well). After 24 h of platting of the cells, cells were treated
with HBR in different concentrations. Again, the cells were incubated
for another 24 h. Then, cells were washed and the MTT experiment was
performed. Results were represented in the percent of viability, which
was calculated from the absorbance value of 96-well plates. Percentage
viability was calculated following the below formula.  

Cellular Uptake of HBR
in Presence of Pd2+ Ions by
Microscopic Imaging
For this experiment, MDA-MB-231 was also
used. Cells were seeded in 6-well plates for 24 h. After that, cells
were treated with HBR (5 mM) in the DMEM media for 4 h. Then, Pd2+ ions (5 μM) were added and incubated for another 4
h. A four percent formaldehyde concentration was prepared in PBS buffer
and used to fix the cell for 30 min. Further, after removing of formaldehyde
solution, PBS buffer was used to wash the cells. Finally, cell morphology
was checked through a microscope in 40x objective. Images were taken
in an Olympus microscope having an AndoriXon 3897 EMCCD camera.
