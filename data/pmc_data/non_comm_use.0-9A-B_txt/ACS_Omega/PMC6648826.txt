Regenerated cellulose
(RC) films exhibit poor water barrier performance,
which seriously restricts its applications. To address this issue,
an impermeable and hydrophobic graphene oxide modified by chemically
grafting octadecylamine (GO-ODA) was utilized to enhance the water
vapor barrier performance of RC nanocomposite films. Compared to the
neat RC film, more than 20% decrease in the coefficient of water vapor
permeability (PH2O) was achieved
by loading only 2.0 wt % GO-ODA. The promising hydrophobicity of GO-ODA
effectively retarded the formation of hydrogen bonding at the relatively
weakened interface between GO and RC, compensating for the diffusion
of water vapor molecules at the interface; on the other hand, the
fully exfoliated GO-ODA nanosheets were inclined to align with the
surface of the as-prepared RC nanocomposite films during hot-pressure
drying, creating a much more tortuous pathway for diffusion of water
molecules. The new insights could be valuable for widening application
of cellulose such as packaging.

Introduction
Among the most of environmentally
friendly polymers, cellulose
is considered as a promising packaging material substitute for petroleum-based
polymers, which is the most abundant biomass material in nature from
plants, tunicates, bacteria, and so forth.1,2 It
has excellent properties such as mechanical robustness, hydrophilicity,
biocompatibility, and biodegradability. More importantly, its severe
problem of difficult-to-process because of dense hydrogen bonding
has been overcome through unique cellulose solvents, such as ionic
liquids, alkali/urea, N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide, and so forth.3−10 However, the regenerated cellulose (RC) film still exhibits an insufficient
water resistance because of the abundant hydrophilic hydroxyl groups
in cellulose molecular chains,11,12 restricting its packaging
application for water-sensitive food and drug.

It has been well
established that the incorporation of layered
nanofillers with high aspect ratio into polymers is an effective strategy
to fabricate high-barrier nanocomposite films.13−15 The layered
nanofillers are expected to act as impermeable obstacle and force
a tortuous pathway for gas molecule diffusion, which significantly
enhances the barrier performance of nanocomposite films. Graphene
oxide (GO) derived from graphene nanosheets is a quasi two-dimensional
(2D) honeycomb lattice material with abundant oxygen-containing functional
groups on its basal planes and edges, such as hydroxyl, epoxide, carbonyl,
and carboxyl. These chemical functional groups make GO strongly hydrophilic,
which promotes complete exfoliation and homogeneous dispersion of
GO in the polar polymer matrix and improves the interfacial bonding
significantly.16−19 Hence, GO is considered as a forward-looking candidate for preparing
high-barrier polar polymer-based nanocomposite films. For instance,
Huang et al. prepared RC/GO nanosheet composite films with a permeability
coefficient of 1.0 × 10–16 cm3 cm
cm–2 s–1 Pa–1, exhibiting 1000 times increased oxygen barrier performance.20 Wang et al. reported layer-by-layer assembly
deposition of GO/poly(lactic acid)/polyethyleneimine, which effectively
created a tortuous pathway to obstruct permeating molecules with a
reduction in oxygen permeability by 99.0%. Although GO could increase
the oxygen barrier performance of polymer composites by several hundred
times, their water vapor barrier performance was hardly improved.21 Because of the high affinity of GO to H2O, hydrogen bonding is easily formed between H2O molecules and the hydrophilic oxygen-containing functional groups
of GO. It results in easy diffusion of H2O molecules between
the GO and polymer matrix. The interfacial bonding between GO and
polymer matrix is destroyed, disabling to resist water vapor permeation.
Therefore, to effectively improve the water vapor barrier performance
of polymer/GO composites, restraining formation of hydrogen bonding
between H2O molecules and GO is the requisite, for example,
through destroying the high affinity to H2O of GO.

Recently, grafting the long alkyl chains has been demonstrated
to lipophilically modify the surface of GO, which can facilitate its
uniform dispersion in the polymer matrix and impair high affinity
to water. As reported, alkylamines such as octadecylamine (ODA) and
dodecylamine (DA) showed ability to turn hydrophilic into hydrophobic
of GO, promoting the application of GO in the non-polar polymers.22−25 Lee et al. decorated GO with DA and observed improved mechanical,
electrical, and barrier properties of linear low-density polyethylene
nanocomposites by the addition of the functionalized graphene.26,27

In this work, the RC/GO-ODA nanocomposite film was prepared
via
a green sodium hydroxide (NaOH)/urea solvent to initially dissolve
cellulose, and then pressure was employed to orient the GO-ODA nanosheets
during hot drying process. Effect of ODA content and morphology on
water vapor resistance was investigated. To reveal the mechanism of
water vapor diffusion in nanocomposite films, time-resolved attenuated
total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR–FTIR)
and 2D correlation analysis were preformed, which improved the spectral
resolution and identified the sequence of spectral intensity changes
in dynamic analysis.28−31

Results and Discussion
Synthesis of ODA-Grafted GO
FTIR
measurement is powerful
to identify the chemical grafting of ODA chains onto GO, as illustrated
in Figure 1. FTIR absorption
peaks appear at 1070 (C–O–C absorption vibration), 1628
(C=C in aromatic ring), 1730 (C=O stretching vibration),
and 3430 cm–1 (−OH absorption vibration),
indicating the existence of oxygen-containing functional groups on
the GO surface.32−34 A new peak centered at 1470 cm–1 (C–N stretching of amide) is observed after grafting, whereas
the peaks of 1070 and 1730 cm–1 disappear, owing
to the nucleophile substitution and the amidation reaction between
the −NH2 group of ODA and C–O–C/–COOH
groups of GO. Besides, the grafting of ODA is confirmed by the significant
enhanced peaks at 2918 and 2850 cm–1 (C–H
stretching) as well as the new CH2 absorption peak (720
cm–1). The above results indicate the successful
grafting of ODA chains to the surface of GO.24,35,36

and TGA curves (E)
of GO and GO-ODA nanosheets.

Figure 1B
presents
the X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of GO and GO-ODA. Apparently,
the diffraction peak of GO is observed at 2θ = 9.6°, and
the d-spacing is 0.92 nm. For GO-ODA, the d-spacing shifts to 1.8 nm with 2θ = 4.9°, in
consistence with the chemical attaching of long ODA chains onto GO
sheets. It is worth noting that another dispersing diffraction peak
of GO-ODA appears at 2θ = 20.2°. It is related to the graphite
structure, indicating the disappearance of partially oxygen-containing
functional groups and the rearrangement of graphitic domains during
the reaction of GO and ODA. This is also confirmed by the huge difference
in hydrophilic–hydrophobic property between GO and GO-ODA (Figure 1C,D). GO exhibits
a low water contact angle (WCA) of 38.2° because of the abundant
oxygen-containing functional groups, whereas the WCA of GO-ODA reaches
125.8°. Therefore, the grafting process transforms the nanofillers
from hydrophilic to hydrophobic, which is more desirable for water
vapor barrier application.

Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA)
analysis was performed to calculate
the grafting ratio of ODA on the surface of GO. As depicted in Figure 1E, a small weight
loss (about 15.3%) of GO powder with the absorption of bound water
occurs before 120 °C. A major weight loss of GO occurs above
120 °C, attributing to the thermal decomposition of labile (120–270
°C) and stable oxygen-containing functional groups (above 270
°C).33 The hydrophobic ODA chains
and the removal of hydrophilic groups minimize the absorption of bond
water. Thus, GO-ODA exhibits high thermal stability and antipyrolysis
(the weight loss is nearly zero) below 120 °C. In the range of
150–250 °C, GO-ODA shows a weight loss of about 11.0%,
which is related to the physically absorbed ODA chains by electrostatic
force and partially unstable and partially oxygen-containing functional
groups of GO-ODA nanosheets. At high temperature above 250 °C,
a significant weight loss of up to 65% originates from the pyrolysis
of grafted ODA chains and oxygen-containing functional groups of GO-ODA
nanosheets.25,37 Taking the theoretical residue
value at 250 °C into account, the grafting ratio of GO-ODA is
about 21.4 wt %.

Structure of RC/GO-ODA Nanocomposite Films
Individually
exfoliated and uniformly dispersed nanofillers have been acknowledged
as highly effective reinforced units for the polymeric matrix, while
the aggregate nanofillers are harmful to the reinforced effects because
of defects. In term of morphology, RC shows a dense texture but a
rough surface with micropore defects (Figure 2a′), probably owing to sharp shrink
of capillary force restrained under the extra pressure during the
rapid desiccation at high temperatures. After introduction of GO-ODA,
the fractured surface displays a homogeneous and denser texture and
no micropore defects are observed when the GO-ODA content is below
5 wt % (Figure 2b–d).
This characteristic surface indirectly suggests the efficient individual
dispersion of GO-ODA and the barrier effect of sharp shrink of filler.
Moreover, as indicated by the red arrow, GO-ODA is inclined parallel
with the RC film surface, which is labeled by the white arrow. Such
an orientation architecture of GO-ODA is profitable to enhance the
barrier performance of the RC/GO-ODA film.38 Although the GO-ODA content reaches 5 wt %, there are some bulges
of defect structure observed in the fracture surface of film (Figure 2e′), which
is the aggregation of GO-ODA nanosheets (marked by white arrow) because
of poor dispersion of high content filler.

of RC and RC/GO-ODA nanocomposite films:
(a–e) are RC, RC0.5, RC1, RC2, and RC5, respectively; (a′–e′)
are magnification of (a–e).

Wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) was performed to investigate
the effect of GO-ODA on the crystalline structure of RC. 2D-WAXD patterns
of RC and RC/GO-ODA films demonstrate similar homogeneous diffraction
rings (Figure S2). It gives a hint that
the formation of cellulose crystals is isotropic and the cooperation
of GO-ODA has almost no effect on crystal modifications. It can be
seen from Figure 3a
that two strong diffraction peaks appear at 2θ = 16.4°
and 17.6° in all RC/GO-ODA films, representing lattice planes
(110)/(200) of cellulose II. These results confirm that nature cellulose
is well dissolved in NaOH/urea solvent and successfully converted
from cellulose I (nature cellulose) to cellulose II.20,39,40 Although the crystalline form
is not altered by GO-ODA, the crystallinity (Xc) of RC films is largely affected. As shown in Figure 3b, the Xc decreases from 42.5 to 34.6% with the loading of GO-ODA.
During the crystallization process of cellulose, the GO-ODA nanosheets
act as a kind of nucleation inhibitor, which could reduce nuclei and
confine the cellulose II crystal for perfection. At higher loading,
the perfect cellulose crystal is further inhibited by the space restriction
due to the dense structure of GO-ODA (probably a network) with oriented
lamellar arrangement in the RC matrix.41,42

intensity profiles and (b) the crystallinity of RC/GO-ODA
nanocomposite films.

The interfacial interaction between RC and GO-ODA was detected
by FTIR, as shown in Figure 4. Noteworthy, the well-known −OH stretching band at
3600–3000 cm–1 is sensitive to hydrogen bonding,
which shifts to higher wavenumber from 3318 to 3339 cm–1 with the loading of GO-ODA. The red shift of the −OH stretching
absorption peak clearly illustrates the weakened hydrogen bonding
between the RC matrix and GO-ODA nanosheets.36,43 Such weakened interactions are attributed to the absent −COOH
and −OH of GO and the insulation of grafting ODA restricts
the formation of hydrogen bonds between RC and GO-ODA. Moreover, a
particular peak of all samples at 895 cm–1 represents
the glycosidic C–H deformation with ring vibration contribution
and −OH bending, proving the β-glycosidic linkages between
glucose in cellulose. As reported, this small peak only appears in
RC.44−46 This result also indicates that the nature cellulose
is transformed from cellulose I to cellulose II after dealing with
NaOH/urea aqueous solution.

films over the wavenumber
range 3600–700 cm–1, (a–e) are RC,
RC0.5, RC1, RC2, and RC5, respectively.

Water Vapor Transport Properties of RC/GO-ODA Nanocomposite
Films
With the oriented dispersion of GO-ODA nanosheets throughout
the cellulose matrix, the water barrier properties of the nanocomposite
films are expected to be improved. As shown in Figure 5, compared with the RC film, PH2O of RC/GO-ODA nanocomposite films is decreased
within the certain filler content range. For instance, a more than
20% decrease in PH2O from 1.71
× 10–12 to 1.35 × 10–12 g cm cm–2 s–1 Pa–1 is achieved for RC2. The addition of hydrophobic GO-ODA is an effective
mean to enhance water barrier properties. Although GO-ODA weakens
the interfacial interactions with the cellulose matrix, which could
be favorable for water permeability through the interface, the higher
hydrophobicity of GO-ODA can compensate for this issue effectively.
Note that the PH2O of RC5 is
increased. It is attributed to the poor dispersion of GO-ODA (Figure 2c′) and poor
interfacial interactions (Figure 2e′), resulting in damaged barrier walls.

Figure 5 Coefficient

nanocomposite films.

To investigate the penetrative path of water vapor molecules
in
composite films, we used time-resolved ATR–FTIR to analyze
the variation of function groups of RC/GO-ODA nanocomposites affected
by water vapor molecules. Figure 6 shows the time-resolved FTIR in the range of 1200–1700
cm–1 of RC and RC0.5 during water vapor permeation.
As universally known, hydrogen bonding (interaction between cellulose
and water) has been deemed as an important factor not only in physics
and chemistry of cellulose but also in water vapor absorption of cellulose.
Given the types of hydrogen bonding, there are three types of water
in nanocomposite films, including free water, nonfreezing bound water
and freezing bound water.47 RC and RC0.5
show the characteristic peaks at 1335 and 1470 cm–1, which stem from the vibrations and in plane bending of −OH
of cellulose chains. Both of the two peaks are sensitive to the bound
water in the cellulose because of interruption of hydrogen bonding.
Another dispersion peak appears at 1640 cm–1 because
of hydrogen bonding absorption of the weak interaction of OHwater···OHwater, corresponding to the free water
of free volume in cellulose.28−50 From Figure 6, the
intensities of all FTIR peaks of RC and RC0.5 gradually increase as
a function of time, indicating that the water vapor slowly passes
through the film samples. Furthermore, 2D correlation analysis can
distinguish the sequence of time-resolved FTIR changes, reflecting
the microstructural variations affected by water vapor molecules in
detail.

Figure 6 Time-resolved FTIR in range 1200–1700 cm–1 of neat RC (a) and RC0.5 (b) at an ambient temperature of 29 °C.

In 2D correlation analysis, synchronous
(φ(v1,v2)) and asynchronous correlation
spectra (ψ(v1,v2)) indicate coordinate similarity of two separate spectral
intensity variations and dissimilarity of the spectral intensity variation
measured at different spectral variables, respectively. It provides
the sequential order of intensity changes of peak v1 and v2. According to the
Noda’s rule, when φ(v1,v2) > 0, if ψ(v1,v2) > 0 (the red area in 2D
correlation
spectra map), the peak v1 varies before
the peak v2, and if ψ(v1,v2) < 0 (the blue area
in 2D correlation spectra map), the peak v1 varies after the peak v2.51,52 Besides, if φ(v1,v2) < 0, the judgemental rule is just reversed. In 2D
synchronous correlation spectra map of water vapor diffusion in the
RC and RC0.5 films in the range of 1700–1200 cm–1, φ(v1,v2) > 0 (Figure 7a,b),
which illustrates that all components in films gradually increase
with the water vapor diffusion process. In the 2D asynchronous correlation
spectra map, ψ(1640, 1470) < 0 and ψ(1640, 1335) <
0 of RC film (Figure 7c), suggesting that the peak 1640 cm–1 varies after
the peak at 1470 and 1335 cm–1. Similar tendency
is shown in the RC0.5 sample (Figure 7d). Therefore, the sequential order of the peak for
water vapor diffusion in the RC film is: 1335/1470 cm–1 → 1640 cm–1. The water vapor molecules
interact with cellulose chains by formation of hydrogen bondings during
diffusion. Subsequently, the free water (i.e. the cluster of water)
forms with the increase of water content. The above results demonstrate
that the water vapor diffusion paths in the cellulose matrix are altered
by the addition of GO-ODA nanosheets, and the mechanism of water vapor
diffusion is the same for both the samples.

2D FTIR correlation spectra for water
vapor diffusion into (a,c) neat RC and (b,d) RC0.5 films in the range
of 1700–1200 cm–1.

Generally, layered filler with large aspect ratio can act
as impermeable
nanoplatelets to intensity the tortuosity of the penetration paths
for diffusing molecules.53−56 Moreover, it is found that oriented filler from hot
pressure drying of RC/nanofiller is an effective method to further
prolong paths of gas molecule permeability and finally to improve
barrier property.43 In this work, it shows
that the hydrophobicity of oriented filler and interfacial interactions
are important factors in determining the water vapor barrier properties
of the RC film. Combining with 2D correlation analysis of time-resolved
FTIR, we propose a preliminary mechanism of water vapor diffusion
into RC and RC/GO-ODA films, as schematically drawn in Figure 8. For RC films, the water molecules
tend to form H-bond interaction with cellulose chains probably in
the amorphous or at the surface of the crystalline phase of RC because
of abundant crystal of cellulose II to form bounded water. Then, water
vapor diffuses into the amorphous phase of RC forming nonfreezing
bound water. Finally, the water vapor spreads to free volume to form
water clusters (free water) in cellulose network and subsequently
escapes out of the cellulose film. In the water vapor diffusion process
of RC, although high crystallinity is presented, the low aspect ratio
and nonoriented crystalline structure of cellulose crystal cannot
effectively serve as impermeable nanoplatelets to improve the barrier
property. On the other hand, superhydrophilic RC is an absorber of
water vapor, which would result in poor water vapor barrier property.
Addition of hydrophobic GO-ODA results in low water vapor permeability
(WVP). Three factors are considered to account for the result. First,
the water vapor molecules tend to diffuse in the vicinity of weakened
interface, but the diffusion rate is immediately reduced because of
high hydrophobicity of GO-ODA, which prevents the formation of hydrogen
bonding between H2O and GO. Moreover, the hydrophobic GO-ODA
nanosheets are an effective hamper to restrict the water vapor diffusion.
Eventually, if the water vapor forms hydrogen bonding with the other
side of cellulose chains for diffusion, it is necessary to bypass
the GO-ODA nanosheets with high aspect ratio, leading to low WVP.

RC/GO-ODA nanocomposite films.

Conclusions
In this work, we successfully synthesized
the hydrophobic GO via
grafting of ODA, which was proved to be an effective water barrier
filler of the RC film. The RC/GO-ODA nanocomposite film was easily
fabricated via an environmentally friendly method to dissolve nature
cellulose incorporating with GO-ODA in NaOH/urea aqueous solution.
Compared to the neat RC film, the tensile strength and Young’s
modulus were also increased with the loading of GO-ODA (Figure S3). Combined with 2D FTIR correlation
spectra for water vapor diffusion into film specimen, it is found
that the water vapor molecules tend to form hydrogen bond interaction
with cellulose chains to form bounded water, and then water vapor
diffuses into free volume to form water clusters (free water) in the
cellulose network and subsequently escape out of the cellulose film.
GO-ODA can retard this process by disruption of hydrogen bonding and
creation of tortuous path for diffusion. The promising hydrophobicity
of GO-ODA effectively retards the formation of hydrogen bonding at
the relatively weakened interface of GO and RC, compensating for the
diffusion at the interface; on the other hand, the GO-ODA nanosheets
can orient and exfoliate in RC during the hot pressure drying, creating
a tortuous pathway for diffusion of water vapor molecules. These results
and insights can provide valuable reference for widening cellulose
application in the area of encapsulation, package, and so forth.

Experimental
Section
Materials
The cotton line of cellulose was friendly
supplied by Hubei Jinhuan Co. Ltd. (Xiangfan, China), and the degree
of polymerization was 500 ± 50. Expandable graphite with an expansion
rate of 200 mL/g was used to fabricate GO, which was provided by Haida
Graphite Co., Ltd. (Qingdao, China). The concentrated sulfuric acid
(H2SO4), hydrochloric acid (HCl), potassium
permanganate (KMnO4), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), ethanol, octadecyl amine (ODA), cetyltrimethyl ammonium
bromide (CTAB), deionized water, urea, and NaOH were purchased from
Kelong Chemical Reagent Factory (Chengdu, China). All reagents were
used as received without further purification.

Preparation of ODA-Grafted
GO (GO-ODA) from Expandable Graphite
First, GO was obtained
from expandable graphite through the modified
“Hummers” method.32 The details
are described in the Supporting Information. 0.6 g GO powder was dispersed in 300 mL deionized water under ultrasonication
for 0.5 h. Subsequently, the suspension was mixed with 90 mL ODA/anhydrous
ethanol solution (0.01 g/mL) under vigorous stirring. The resultant
mixture was refluxed 24 h for grafting at 70 °C. After the end
of chemical grafting, the product was separated by filtration, followed
by washing with large amounts of ethanol and filtering repeatedly
to remove the physically absorbed ODA chains. Finally, the resulting
products were dried in a vacuum oven at 50 °C for 24 h to evaporate
the residual ethanol.

Fabrication of RC/GO-ODA Nanocomposite Films
RC nanocomposite
films with the GO-ODA loading of 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 5.0 wt % were
fabricated via an environmentally friendly method to dissolve nature
cellulose followed by drying under a certain pressure. Taking the
0.5 wt % GO-ODA as an example, first, 25.78 mg of dried GO-ODA powder
soaked in 1.0 g of anhydrous ethanol for 60 min to promote the dispersion.
Then, the soaked GO-ODA was dispersed into 162.0 g of deionized water
uniformly with the aid of surfactant CTAB (the mass ratio of CTAB
to GO-ODA was 4/5) via an ultrasonication for 2 h. The resulting suspension
directly mixed with 24 g urea and 14 g NaOH, and the suspension was
precooled to −12.0 °C for dissolution of nature cellulose.
5.13 g of cellulose was immediately added into precooled suspension
with vigorous mechanical stirring (3000 rpm) for 5 min at ambient
temperature. The resultant solution with a cellulose concentration
of 2.5 wt % was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 2 min to degas. Subsequently,
25 g of homogeneous cellulose solution was placed into a 10 ×
10 cm2 rectangular glass holder at 20 °C for 12 h
to gel. After gelation, the sample was immersed in fresh water to
remove urea, CTAB, and NaOH at ambient temperature until the pH of
wash water was ca. 7. Finally, the RC/GO-ODA nanocomposite hydrogel
was hot dried under 2 MPa pressure at 150 °C for 10 min. The
dried RC/GO-ODA nanocomposite films with a thickness of about 80 μm
were coded as RCx, where the x is
the mass concentration of GO-ODA. For comparison, the fabrication
process of neat RC was the same as RC/GO-ODA nanocomposite films.

FTIR Spectroscopy
To determine the chemical structure
of GO-ODA, FTIR was performed on a Nicolet 6700 FTIR spectrometer
(Thermal Scientific, USA) in the transmission mode. The GO and GO-ODA
were ground with potassium bromide (KBr) followed by pressing into
KBr disks for FTIR characterization. For each FTIR measurement, the
scanning range was 4000–500 cm–1 and, on
average, 16 scans were collected at a resolution of 2 cm–1.

To detect the interaction of GO-ODA and RC, ATR–FTIR
was carried out on a Nicolet 6700 FTIR spectrometer (Thermal Scientific,
USA). For each FTIR measurement, on average 32 scans were collected
at a resolution of 2 cm–1. Besides, time-resolved
ATR–FTIR was performed at 29 °C to reveal the water diffusion
process in RC/GO-ODA nanocomposite films. As shown in Figure S1 in
the Supporting Information, the single-reflection
ATR crystal accessory was covered by an 80 μm thickness of film
specimen with a rectangular film (15.0 × 15.0 mm2),
and overlaid three layers of filter paper with the same size. Then,
0.5 mL of water was injected into the filter paper during the data
acquisition. For each film specimen, 32 scans were added together
to obtain the spectrum signal at 2 cm–1 resolution
in the scan range of 1700–1200 cm–1. 2D correlation
analysis via a “2DCS Professional” software established
by Dr. Tao Zhou (Sichuan University, China) was used to analyze the
series of time-resolved FTIR spectra. In the 2D correlation spectra,
blue regions and red regions indicate negative and positive correlation
intensities, respectively.

X-ray Diffraction
The GO and GO-ODA
samples were used
for XRD characterization on a DX-1000 diffractometer with Cu Kα
irradiation at 40 kV to characterize the layer-to-layer distance.
For each XRD measurement, the scanning wavelength, scanning rate,
and scanning 2θ range were 0.154 nm, 3.6°/min, and 2–30°,
respectively.

Thermal Gravimetric Analysis
TGA
was performed on a
209F1 instrument (Netzsch, Germany) under a N2 atmosphere.
Mass change of the sample (about 5.0 mg) in the alumina pan was recorded
at the temperature range from 40 to 800 °C with a heating rate
of 10 °C/min.

Field-Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy
The morphology
of RC/GO-ODA films was observed by field-emission scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) (Nova NanoSEM450, FEI, USA) at an accelerated voltage
of 5 kV. Before measurement, the sample was frozen for 30 min in liquid
nitrogen and then cryo-fractured. Subsequently, the cross-section
of samples was sprayed a thin layer of gold.

Wide Angle X-ray Diffraction
2D WAXD images of films
were acquired on 15U (λ = 0.124 nm) at Shanghai Synchrotron
Radiation Facility (SSRF, Shanghai, China) to obtain the crystal structure
and crystallinity (Xc) of cellulose. The
distance between detector and samples was 160 mm. The Xc of film can be calculated as follows (eq 1). 1  where the Aamorp and Acryst are the fitted area of amorphous
phase and crystalline phase, respectively.

Mechanical Testing
According to the ASTM standard (D638),
the mechanical properties of the rectangular strips of RC/GO-ODA films
with a width of about 10 mm and a length of 40 mm were measured on
an universal tensile testing machine (model 5576, Instron Instrument,
USA) with a 20 mm span length at a tensile speed of 1.0 mm/min. Before
measurement, the thickness of samples was measured separately for
at least five times. The parameters of mechanical properties were
evaluated from at least 5 samples for each group.

Water Vapor
Permeability
WVP of RC/GO-ODA films was
measured gravimetrically on a W3/031 WVP test machine (Jinan Languang
Mechanical and Electrical Technology Co., Ltd., China) at 38 °C
and 90% relative humidity. A water transmission container was divided
by films into the dry chamber and the chamber with a constant saturated
vapor pressure. During the water vapor passing the dry chamber through
films, the weight of deionized water in water transmission container
was continuously monitored in real-time. Finally, the coefficient
of WVP (PH2O) was calculated
by the following equation 2  where Δm is the weight
variation of water transmission container in a certain time span (t); d and A are the thickness
and the water vapor transmission area of film specimen, respectively; Pv is the partial pressure of water vapor.

Water Contact Angle
GO and GO-ODA films were tested
on optical contact angle (DSA30KRPUSS, Germany) to measure WCA to
evaluate the effect of chemical grafted ODA on GO. 1.0 mg of GO and
GO-ODA was dissolved in deionized water and dichloromethane, respectively,
coating on the polyethylene terephthalate film after ultrasonic dispersion
for 30 min. After this, the resulting film was dried in a vacuum oven
at 50 °C for WCA measurement.
