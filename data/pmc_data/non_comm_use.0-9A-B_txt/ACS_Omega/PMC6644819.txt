Bimetallic
Ag@Au nanoparticles (NPs) have received significant
research interest because of their unique optical properties and molecular
sensing ability through surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS).
However, the synthesis of Ag@Au core–shell plasmonic nanostructures
with precisely controlled size and shape remained a great challenge.
Here, we report a simple approach for the synthesis of bimetallic
Ag@Au nanodisks of about 13.5 nm thickness and different diameters
through a seed-mediated growth process. The synthesis involves the
conformal deposition of Au atoms at the corner sites of Ag nanoplate
(AgNPL) seeds coupled with site-selective oxidative etching of AgNPL
edges to generate Ag@Au nanodisks. The resultant Ag@Au nanodisks manifest
significantly improved chemical stability and tunable localized surface
plasmon resonance from the visible to the near-infrared spectral range.
Moreover, in comparison to AgNPLs, the Ag@Au nanodisks showed greatly
enhanced SERS performance with an enhancement factor up to 0.47 ×
105, which is nearly 3-fold higher than that of the original
AgNPLs (0.18 × 105). Furthermore, the Ag@Au nanodisks
show a high sensitivity for detecting probe molecules such as crystal
violet of concentration as low as 10–9 M and excellent
reproducibility, with the SERS intensity fluctuation less than 12.5%.
The synthesis route adapted for the controlled fabrication of Ag@Au
nanodisks can be a potential platform for maneuvering other bimetallic
plasmonic nanostructures useful for plasmonics and sensing applications.

Introduction
Noble
metal nanostructures have generated a huge research interest
owing to their unique tunable localized surface plasmon resonance
(LSPR) properties,1 which render their
widespread application in various fields such as photocatalysis,2 plasmonics,3,4 surface-enhanced Raman
scattering (SERS),5 biosensing,6 and biomedicine.7 Since
its discovery, SERS has been regarded as a fascinating analytical
technique for detecting analyte molecules with ultrahigh sensitivity.8−10 Noble metal nanoparticles (NPs) such as Ag3,11,12 and Au13−16 with various shapes have been
widely investigated for SERS applications because of their morphology-dependent
high anisotropy and tunable LSPR, which can produce strong electromagnetic
(EM) fields localized around the NP surface, resulting in the generation
of near-field enhancement effects.17 In
particular, triangular Ag nanoplates (NPLs) with relatively larger
{111} facets have been found to exhibit a strong coupling of LSPR
with the analyte molecules because of the strong EM field accumulation
at their edges,18 manifesting a highly
enhanced SERS signal for a variety of analyte molecules.16 However, the Ag NPLs are thermodynamically unstable,
and the poor chemical stability toward oxidation in physiological
conditions is the principal limitation for their use in practical
applications.19 On the other hand, Ag@Au
core–shell-type bimetallic NPs have received considerable attention
because of their improved chemical stability and the possibility of
tuning the LSPR peak positions from the visible to the near-infrared
(NIR) region by tailoring their structure and composition.20−26 Intensive research efforts have been made on controlling the LSPR
properties and the enhancement of chemical stability of such core–shell-type
bimetallic nanostructures.11,27−30 Specifically, the controlled growth of an ultrathin Au shell around
Ag seeds to obtain bimetallic Ag@Au core–shell structures is
largely considered to be a promising strategy to tune the LSPR and
enhance the chemical stability of the plasmonic nanostructure.27,29 As an example, Yang et al.28 showed that
the conformal deposition of an Au shell of a few atomic-layer thickness
(6 atomic layers of Au) over Ag nanocubes can significantly improve
their chemical stability and SERS activity.

Recently, seed-mediated
solution-phase growth process has become
the most attractive technique for the preparation of nanocrystals
of bimetallic/multimetallic systems with well-controlled size and
shape.31,32 The controlled synthesis of Ag@Au NPs of
diverse shapes with a finely tuned LSPR peak position from the visible
to the IR region has been extensively reported in the literature.29,30,32−34 However, the
fabrication of bimetallic Ag@Au core–shell NPs with spatial
control over the shell thicknesses remained a great challenge. This
challenge primarily arises because of the inherent galvanic exchange
reaction that occurred between the Ag NP seeds and Au3+, making the uniform deposition of Au over Ag NPs extremely difficult,
which usually leads to the formation of hollow nanoframes.35−37 Considerable efforts have been made to overcome this obstacle by
preventing the galvanic reaction, achieving an Au shell of varying
thickness onto the Ag NP seeds.38−40 Yang et al.28 developed a strategy for the synthesis of Ag@Au core–shell
nanocubes with 3–6 atomic layers of Au-shell thickness by the
parallel reduction of Au3+ atoms onto the cubic Ag seeds
using ascorbic acid (AA), where the reduction of Au3+ ion
dominated by AA resulted in the suppression of the galvanic reaction
between Ag and Au3+.28 Recently,
Cathcart et al.30 demonstrated an effective
deposition of Au onto the Ag NP seeds assisted by poly(styrenesulfonate)
to obtain Ag@Au core–shell NPs with tunable LSPR from 470 to
800 nm, with a greatly improved chemical stability. On the other hand,
oxidative etching of metal NPs has been extensively reported as a
novel strategy to control the shape of the metal NPs.41 For instance, Hong et al.42 described
a process of oxidative etching of Au NPLs by the chlorine ions of
the Au precursor, capable of producing Au NPs of different shapes.
Lin et al.43 reported a facile synthesis
process for the fabrication of uniform spherical Ag NPs via the seed-mediated
growth coupled with oxidative etching of Ag nanocubes using Cu2+ ions. Despite all these efforts, the process of controlled
synthesis of Ag@Au core–shell nanostructures with desired sizes
and shapes remained unclear.

Herein, we present a facile, seed-mediated
strategy for the fabrication
of Ag@Au nanodisks through a galvanic reaction-free deposition of
Au atoms onto Ag NPLs followed by tip-selective oxidative etching
reactions. The galvanic etching-free deposition of Au atoms and oxidative
etching occur simultaneously after the injection of HAuCl4 at a relatively higher reaction pH, which leads to a shape evolution
from AgNPLs to Ag@Au nanodisks. The resultant Ag@Au nanodisks exhibit
excellent chemical stability, and their LSPR peak position can be
tuned from 656 to 780 nm just by varying their diameter. Furthermore,
owing to the unique disk-like structure of the Ag@Au nanodisks and
their LSPR position matching with the laser excitation wavelength
(785 nm), the nanostructures manifest significantly improved SERS
performance for the detection of crystal violet (CV) molecules with
a concentration as low as 10–9 M.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
and Characterization of Ag@Au Nanodisks
The
triangular Ag NPLs of 20–35 nm edge lengths (Figure S1) were synthesized following the procedure reported
previously.44 The bimetallic Ag@Au core–shell
nanodisks were obtained by the deposition of reduced Au atoms onto
the triangular Ag NPL seeds and further controlled oxidative dissolutions
at the tips using polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as the surfactant and
AA as the reducing agent. The pH value of the reaction solution was
adjusted to 11.2 by adding NaOH (0.2 M) solution, with a subsequent
addition of the HAuCl4 precursor solution at a relatively
slow injection rate. Recent studies have shown that the introduction
of HAuCl4 solution at a higher pH (pH = 11.2) reduces the
reduction potential of gold ions significantly, which enables the
conformal deposition of uniform metallic shells over the Ag seeds.45 Specifically, during the slow titration in the
presence of NaOH, after the quick neutralization of HAuCl4 by OH–, the produced [AuCl4]− undergo a ligand exchange process with OH– to
generate AuCl(OH)3– and Au(OH)4–, which have a lower reduction potential than
the [AuCl4]−.46 By controlling the degree of the neutralization process, the smoothness
of Au shells and the morphology of the resultant Ag@Au NPs could be
effectively tailored by avoiding the galvanic reaction.47 On the other hand, the presence of Cl– ions generated from the dissociation of AuCl4 favors
the selective oxidative etching of the edges of the Ag NPLs.48,49

The growth of bimetallic Ag@Au nanodisks reported here is
distinct from the previous studies as we combine both the galvanic
reaction-free deposition of Au and oxidative dissolution reaction
of the edges of Ag NPLs to obtain Ag@Au core–shell nanodisks.
The suppression of galvanic replacement at room temperature was demonstrated
by Yang et al. for Ag@Au nanocubes,28 and
the strategy has been extended by several other groups for the fabrication
of other bimetallic systems.29,50 On the other hand,
the oxidative dissolution reaction has been exploited to other NP
systems for controlled transformation of their shapes into other morphologies.12,41,42,51,52 As an example, O’Brien et al.52 have demonstrated the transformation of hexagonal
Au NPLs to uniform Au circular disks through selective oxidative etching
in the presence of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). Uniform
circular Au nanodisks were obtained because of the strong binding
of HAuCl4 with CTAB, which enabled the reaction to proceed
with the lowest metal coordination number in a self-limiting fashion,
followed by selective oxidation at the tip of the Au NPLs by Au3+ ions. In the present synthesis, as the selective oxidation
of the tip edges of triangular Ag NPLs was performed without a strong
reducing agent, the galvanic replacement reaction is unavoidable,
which usually leads to the formation of bimetallic nanoframes.36 The key premise of this synthesis is that the
slow addition of HAuCl4 at a higher pH (pH = 11.2) by introducing
aqueous NaOH solution decreases the reduction potential of [AuCl4]−. Consequently, a conformal deposition
of reduced Au atoms occurs onto Ag NPLs by avoiding the galvanic reaction,
and further a conproportionation reaction occurs selectively at the
corner sites of the Ag NPLs rather than the other faces. By increasing
the amount of HAuCl4, the Ag NPLs could be converted into
Ag@Au core–shell nanodisks through the oxidative dissolution
reaction.

A schematic illustration of the steps involved in
the controlled
transformation from the triangular Ag NPLs into Ag@Au nanodisks is
presented in Figure 1A. To understand the synthetic steps better, we carried out the transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of the samples prepared at different
Au precursor concentrations (Figure 1B). The TEM results in Figure 1B(a–d), confirm the reduced Au atoms
are selectively bonded at the tips of the Ag NPLs instead of other
triangular faces. For Au precursor concentrations higher than the
optimum, the reduced Au atoms diffuse to the triangular faces, and
oxidative dissolution takes place at the edges of the Ag NPLs to gradually
evolve into circular disk-like structures. It is evident that the
galvanic replacement-free conformal deposition of Au atoms proceeds
selectively at the tips of the Ag NPLs, which serve as initial seeding
sites for controlled oxidation at the edges and subsequent diffusion
of Au atoms to other faces.52

evolution of Ag@Au nanodisks at different growth stages upon increasing

dissolution at the tips of Ag NPLs and conformal deposition.

Figure 2a–d
shows the low- and high-magnification TEM images of the triangular
Ag NPL seeds and the obtained bimetallic Ag@Au nanodisks. The formation
of triangular Ag NPLs with sharp corners along with a few hexagonal
particles is evident in the TEM images presented in Figure 2a,b. Figure 2c,d displays the TEM images of Ag@Au nanodisks
after their transformation from Ag NPLs. The formation of uniform
disk-like structures with an average size of ca. 45 nm is very clear
from these micrographs. The distribution of the elements (Au and Ag)
in the disk-like final structures can be seen in the energy-dispersive
spectrometry (EDS) elemental mapping images presented in Figures 2e–g. The
elemental mapping images clearly demonstrate that Ag (green) is located
at the core and Au (red) remains around the Ag core in the Ag@Au nanodisks.
Furthermore, we carried out atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging
of the Ag NPLs and Ag@Au nanodisks to estimate their thicknesses.
Typical topographic images of Ag NPLs and Ag@Au nanodisks and their
height profiles are displayed in Figure 3. The AFM images confirm the formation of
Ag NPLs (Figure 3a,b)
and Ag@Au nanodisks (Figure 3d,e). The surface height profile plots (Figure 3c,f) further reveled the smooth noncorrugated
surface of the bimetallic nanodisks. The thicknesses of the Ag NPLs
and Ag@Au nanodisks were determined to be 10 and 13.5 nm, respectively.

nanodisks with respect to bare Ag NPLs indicates the formation of
Au layer over them. The flat profile of the Ag@Au nanodisks (f) indicates
their smooth/noncorrugated surface.

To study the effect of the reaction solution pH on the galvanic
reaction between Au3+ ions and Ag NPLs, we carried out
a set of control experiments by changing the reaction conditions.
(i) The synthesis was carried out at pH = 4, without introducing NaOH,
keeping all other reaction conditions fixed. Surprisingly, the obtained
products were bimetallic Ag@Au nanorings with well-defined interior
gaps (Figure S2). EDS mapping and the line
scanning analysis of the nanorings reveal their alloy (Ag@Au) nature
(Figure S2d,e). As the reduction power
of AA is low, at this condition, the rate of galvanic reaction becomes
high (Rred < Rgal), resulting in the formation of hollow Ag@Au nanorings
with well-defined pore diameter.35 (ii)
We increased the concentration of the HAuCl4 precursor
solution (2-fold higher than the concentration used for the fabrication
of nanodisks), resulting in the formation of well-defined flower-like
porous Ag@Au nanostructures (Figure S3).
The formation of flower-like structures occurred because of the partial
galvanic reaction between the Ag NPL seeds and Au3+ as
well as the overgrowth of Au shells on the Ag NPLs. These results
unambiguously confirm that the reaction pH and concentration of HAuCl4 play crucial roles in controlling the reduction kinetics,
which directly influence the shape of the final products.

In
addition, previous studies have shown that the surfactant PVP
can also favor in directing anisotropic growth.53 In specific, PVP can prevent the oxidative etching events,54 and the hydroxyl −OH groups present in
the reaction mixture can act as mild reducing agents.55 To validate the role played by PVP, we carried out two
control experiments. First, the synthesis was carried out without
the introduction of PVP, keeping all other conditions unchanged. As
can be observed in Figure S4, disk-shaped
nanostructures of different sizes were formed in the absence of PVP.
The formation of few small Au NPs unevenly attached to disk-like nanostructures
could also be observed (Figure S4). Second,
PVP of the reaction mixture was replaced with another stabilizing
agent CTAB of the same molar concentration. As can be seen in Figure S5, the addition of CTAB as the stabilizing
agent leads to the formation of hexagonal Ag@Au NPs instead of Ag@Au
nanodisks. The change in the morphology of the nanostructures can
be ascribed to the selective binding of CTAB onto the (100) facet
of Ag NPLs, which permits the oxidative etching to occur only at the
corner sites of the Ag NPL seeds upon the introduction of Au3+ ion solution,41 resulting in the formation
of hexagonal Ag@Au nanostructures.

As the fabricated Ag@Au nanostructures
contain silver (Ag), which
is chemically unstable toward many chemical reactions, especially
oxidation reactions,56 we proceed to evaluate
the chemical stability of the obtained Ag@Au nanodisks, monitoring
their reaction with H2O2, a strong oxidant,
through UV–vis spectroscopy. As can be seen in Figure 4a, the LSPR peak intensity
of the original triangular Ag NPLs diminished within 2 min of the addition of about
0.2 mL aqueous H2O2 solution (2.3%). By contrast,
the Ag@Au nanodisks showed only a slight decrement in the SPR peak
intensity even after 12 h of the addition of H2O2 solution (Figure 4b). The results clearly suggest a remarkable enhancement in the chemical
stability of the Ag NPLs after their transformation to Ag@Au nanodisks.
The improved chemical stability of the nanostructures is due to the
formation of Au shell over the Ag NP surface.29,50

nanodisks before and after the addition of 2.3% aqueous H2O2. Insets show the corresponding photographic images
before (left) and after (right) the addition of H2O2.

It is well-known that the bimetallic
Ag@Au nanostructures exhibit
size-dependent LSPR properties, which can be precisely adjusted from
the visible to the NIR spectral range.52 To monitor how a change in the diameter of Ag@Au nanodisks affects
their LSPR, we fabricated Ag@Au nanodisks of different diameters by
varying the amount of Ag NPL seeds in the reaction mixture. For this,
we used 2, 5, 10, and 15 mL of Ag NPL seeds in the synthesis solution
that yielded Ag@Au nanodisks of diameters 27, 33, 38, and 45 nm, respectively.
The utilization of Ag NPLs in higher concentrations in the reaction
mixture induced the formation of fewer Au sites at their edges. Consequently,
there occurred a less oxidative etching reaction at the edges of the
Ag NPLs and a higher overgrowth (of Au layer) onto their other faces,
producing Ag@Au nanodisks of higher diameters. In fact, utilizing
this procedure, Ag@Au nanodisks of different diameters could be fabricated
with great control. The UV–vis absorption spectra of the Ag@Au
nanostructures (Figure 5a) revealed that the characteristic LSPR peak at 656 nm for 27 nm
nanodisks, which suffered red shifts to 689, 726, and 780 nm on increasing
the diameter to 33, 38, and 45 nm, respectively. The results are in
accordance with the expected line, considering the variation of the
effective dielectric constant of the bimetallic structures with the
increase of the Au shell width.57,58

and corresponding EFs values.

SERS Properties of Ag@Au Nanodisks
The SERS performance
of Ag@Au nanodisks was studied using the aqueous solution-based SERS
detection by incubating the plasmonic nanostructures in CV solutions
and compared with the SERS performance of Ag@Au nanorings and Ag NPLs
under the same conditions. The utilization of CV as a probe molecule
in the present study is specifically because of its distinct Raman
spectral features and the natural adsorption characteristic over the
Au NP surface without chemical modifications.59Figure 5b compares
the solution-phase SERS spectra of CV-adsorbed triangular Ag NPLs,
Ag@Au nanorings, and Ag@Au nanodisks, respectively. As can be seen
from Figure 5b, the
obtained bimetallic Ag@Au nanodisks exhibit a significantly higher
SERS signal intensity compared to the bare Ag NPLs and bimetallic
Ag@Au nanorings.

The quantification of the SERS signal was performed
by the estimation of SERS enhancement factor (EF) for the most prominent
Raman peak at 1620 cm–1, using the expression (eq 1) 1  where ISERS and INor are
the SERS signal intensities of the sample
and the normal Raman peak of CV at ∼1620 cm–1, and NSERS and NNor are the corresponding values of the analyte probe molecules
(CV) at the incident laser spot. We consider the adsorbed CV probe
molecules distributed uniformly in aqueous solution; therefore, the
values of NSERS and NNor can be used with the CV concentrations such as 1.0
× 10–6 M (CV incubated with NPs) and 1.0 ×
10–3 M (CV solution), respectively.

The signal
EFs were estimated considering the intensity of the
Raman peak appeared at 1620 cm–1 (Figure S6). The calculated EF for the Ag@Au nanodisks was
5.97 × 103, which is approximately 3- and 2.3-fold
higher than the same for the Ag NPLs (2.0 × 103) and
Ag@Au nanorings (2.55 × 103), respectively. In Figure 5c,d, we compare the
SERS spectra of Ag@Au nanodisks of different diameters and their estimated
signal EF values as a function of disk diameter. The results presented
in Figure 5d demonstrate
that the EF value increases with the diameter of the Ag@Au nanodisks.
The Ag@Au nanodisks of higher diameters (45 nm) exhibit a higher signal
EF compared to the Ag@Au nanodisks of lower diameters (Figure 5d). The observed results are
in good agreement with the previous reports.60,61

It is largely believed that solid SERS substrates or films
produce
intense “hot spots”, which improve significantly their
SERS intensities.62,63 Thus, we evaluated the substrate-based
SERS performance by depositing the same amount of Ag NPL and Ag@Au
nanodisk (45 nm diameter) samples over silicon (Si) substrates after
drying the probe CV molecules (solution) over the samples prior to
the SERS analysis (Figure 6a). As can be seen from Figure 6a, the substrate prepared with Ag@Au nanodisks exhibits
much enhanced Raman signals in comparison to the Raman signal intensities
obtained from their solution-casted counterpart. Apart from the effect
of dispersion media (air in the first case and water in the second
case),64 the substrate-based assembly of
plasmonic nanostructures seems to be of help in producing uniform
and more intense “hot spots” which are responsible for
the enhancement of Raman signal of the analytes. The Ag@Au nanodisks
revealed highly intense Raman signals in comparison to the Ag NPLs.
The EF values were calculated to be 0.18 × 105 and
0.47 × 105 for Ag NPLs and Ag@Au nanodisks, respectively.
In comparison to bare Ag NPLs, the Ag@Au nanodisks exhibited almost
2.5-fold higher EF values. The estimated SERS EF for Ag@Au nanodisk
was slightly less compared to the previous reports of Ag@Au nanostructures,
as shown in Table S1. The low EF estimated
for our Ag@Au nanodisks might be due to their nonuniform distribution/assembly
over the Si substrate, as the SERS substrates were prepared simply
by drop-casing their colloidal solutions. On the other hand, as has
been shown in the AFM results in Figure 2f, the obtained Ag@Au nanodisks have flat,
noncorrugated surfaces, which generate plasmonic hot spots of relatively
lower intensities.

Figure 6 (a) Comparison of the SERS signals of bare AgNPLs and
Ag@Au nanodisks
deposited over Si substrates (CV, 1 × 10–6 M).
(b) SERS spectra of Ag@Au nanodisks for different CV concentrations
(from 10–6 to 10–9 M). (c) Reproducibility
analysis of the SERS spectra of Ag@Au nanodisks (1 × 10–6 M CV) obtained from 12 randomly selected sites of the same substrate.
(d) Corresponding peak intensity distribution at 1620 cm–1 for 12 sites of the SERS spectra.

To evaluate the SERS sensitivity of the Ag@Au nanodisks assembled
over the Si substrate, we acquired the SERS spectra with different
CV concentrations ranging from 1 × 10–6 to
1 × 10–9 M (Figure 6b). The SERS spectra for 1 × 10–6 M of CV revealed highly intense Raman peaks. However,
their intensity decreased gradually on the reduction of CV concentration.
To evaluate the SERS response of the fabricated Ag@Au nanodisks, the
intensity of the 1620 cm–1 Raman dispersion peak
of CV was recorded for different concentrations of the CV solution
(Figure 6b). As can
be observed in Figure S7 (Supporting Information), the intensity of this most intense Raman signal of CV varied linearly
for the 10–6 to 10–9 M concentration
range. In addition, as can be seen from Figure 6b, SERS signals are detectable even for the
CV concentration of 10–9 M, suggesting that the
resultant Ag@Au nanodisks are capable to detect CV molecules down
to the 1 × 10–9 M concentration range. Notably,
the observed sensitivity is comparable to the previous reports for
bimetallic nanostructures (Table S1). The
enhanced SERS efficiency of the Ag@Au nanodisks can be ascribed to
two main plausible factors: (i) the LSPR peak of the Ag@Au disks at
780 nm is very near to the laser excitation wavelength used for recording
the SERS spectra, which can be strongly coupled with the incident
laser source, producing the resonance Raman effect.65,66 (ii) The effective adsorption of CV molecules over the Ag@Au nanodisks
and enhancement in the EM field between the nanogaps, which can serve
as “hot spots” for a further increase in the SERS signal.21 To demonstrate the reproducibility of the SERS
substrates fabricated with Ag@Au nanodisks, the SERS spectra were
measured at 12 different randomly selected sites of a substrate, for
the CV concentration of 10–6 M. As can be observed
in Figure 6c, the intensity
of the SERS signal fluctuates by only about one order from place to
place. The SERS reproducibility of the fabricated substrates was assessed
by calculating the relative standard deviation (RSD) of the most dominant
peak intensity at 1620 cm–1 (Figure 6d). The RSD value was obtained using the
equation: RSD = SD/Im, where SD is the
standard deviation of the peak intensity and Im is the average Raman peak intensities of the most dominant
peaks.67 The RSD of the 1620 cm–1 peak for 12 different sites was estimated to be 12.5%, indicating
that the SERS substrates fabricated using Ag@Au nanodisks exhibit
excellent reproducibility.

Conclusions
In
summary, we present a simple, seed-mediated route for the fabrication
of chemically stable bimetallic Ag@Au nanodisks with tunable LSPR
response extending from the visible to the NIR spectral region. The
high reaction pH and the tip-selective oxidative etching process utilized
were found to be crucial for the suppression of the galvanic reaction,
ultimately converting the triangular Ag NPLs into Ag@Au nanodisks.
The obtained Ag@Au nanodisks not only show enhanced chemical stability,
but also excellent optical properties. By simply changing the amount
of Ag NPL seed particles, Ag@Au nanodisks of diameters 27–45
nm, with tunable LSPR peak position from the visible to the NIR region
could be fabricated. The as-prepared Ag@Au nanodisks exhibit highly
enhanced SERS activity with the CV signal EF as high as 0.47 ×
105. The SERS substrates prepared using the fabricated
nanodisks can detect CV concentration down to 10–9 M. The synthesis approach utilized to prepare Ag@Au bimetallic nanostructures
of high chemical stability and tunable plasmonic and SERS properties
indicates that it is a promising technique for fabricating other type
of core–shell bimetallic nanostructures for applications in
plasmonics and biosensing.

Synthesis of Ag NPL Seed NPs
The
used process for the
synthesis of Ag NPLs of ca. 25–35 nm edge lengths was similar
to the process we reported earlier.44 Briefly,
0.4 mL of 0.01 M aqueous AgNO3 solution and 0.6 mL of 0.1
M trisodium citrate were mixed together, followed by the addition
of DI water to make the final volume of the reaction solution of 40
mL. The mixture solution was magnetically stirred for 10 min, and
then 0.4 mL of freshly prepared NaBH4 solution (100 mM)
was added. Subsequently, 0.1 mL of H2O2 was
quickly injected to the previous solution. The color of the reaction
mixture turned light yellow, yellow, red, green, and finally blue
within 3–4 min. The final products (Ag NPLs) were collected
by centrifugation at 12 000 rpm for about 30 min, followed
by repeated washing in DI water.

Preparation of Bimetallic
Ag@Au Nanodisks
The Ag@Au
core–shell nanodisks were prepared by the seed-mediated growth
process at room temperature using Ag NPLs as the template particles,
PVP as the surfactant, and AA as the reducing agent. In a typical
synthesis, 100 mg of AA and 66.6 mg of PVP were dissolved in 15 mL
of DI water in a glass vial under magnetic stirring, after which 5
mL of the presynthesized aqueous suspension of Ag NPL seeds and 0.5
mL of 0.2 M aqueous NaOH solution were added into the reaction mixture
sequentially. NaOH solution was added to increase the pH of the reaction
mixture to 11.2. Then, the conformal deposition of Au and subsequent
oxidative etching were performed by slow titration, adding 100 μL
of 0.1 M aqueous HAuCl4 precursor solution slowly (10 μL/min)
by a syringe. The color of the solution mixture changed from dark
blue to pink, indicating the formation of Ag@Au nanodisks. The product
was collected by centrifugation at 12 000 rpm for 15 min and
subsequent washing in DI water. The obtained product was redispersed
in DI water. The formation of free AuNPs was avoided by optimizing
the concentration of the Au precursor solution, injection rate, and
the concentration of AA in the reaction mixture. The diameter of the
Ag@Au nanodisks was controlled by simply varying the amount of Ag
NPL seeds (5, 10, 15, and 20 mL) in the reaction mixture, keeping
all other conditions fixed.

Materials Characterization
The UV–vis
spectra
of the samples were collected using an Agilent 8453 UV–vis
spectrophotometer. The TEM images of the samples were collected in
a JEOL JEM-1010 microscope operating at 80 kV. The EDS elemental mapping
of the samples was carried out in a Hitachi SU 8020 microscope operating
in STEM mode at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. The samples for
TEM and EDS mapping analysis were prepared by dispersing the colloidal
nanostructures over carbon-coated Cu grids and subsequent drying at
room temperature. AFM of the samples was performed in a Bruker (ScanAsyst-Air
model) microscope operating in tapping mode. For AFM analysis, the
colloidal nanostructures were deposited onto a Si substrate and dried
overnight at ambient conditions. Room-temperature Raman and SERS spectra
of the nanostructures were recorded in a Bruker (SENTERRA) Raman spectrometer
equipped with an Ar-ion laser of 785 nm excitation wavelength (λex).

Aqueous Solution-Based SERS Detection
The SERS spectra
were obtained by using the same concentration of samples incubated
in 25 μL of an aqueous solution of CV (10–6 M) for 2 h. The CV-adsorbed colloidal suspensions were then transferred
to well-cleaned glass capillary tubes prior to SERS analysis. The
Raman spectra of the solutions were collected using a 785 nm laser
excitation source of 4.7 mW power with 4.0 μm beam diameter
projected through a 50× objective lens.

Silicon Substrate-Based
SERS Detection
The samples
for substrate-based SERS were prepared by drying the same concentrations
of the as-prepared AgNPL and Ag@Au nanodisk samples over clean silicon
substrates (8 mm × 8 mm). In a typical procedure, 50 μL
of each of the NP-containing suspensions (1 mg/mL) was deposited on
Si substrates and then allowed to dry at room temperature. After this,
25 μL of an aqueous CV solution (10–6 M) was
deposited over the sample and dried at room temperature. The Raman
spectra were recorded using a 785 nm laser with the excitation source
at room temperature. For all samples, the laser spot was fixed to
4 μM under a 50× objective lens; power density was 4.7
mW; and the signal acquisition time was set to be 3 s.
