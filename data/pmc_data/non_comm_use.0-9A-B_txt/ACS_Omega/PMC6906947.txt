Reactions of bifunctional perfluoroarylsilanes, p- and m-C6F4(SiMe3)2 as well as o-BrC6F4SiMe3, with substituted perfluoroarenes having
electron-withdrawing groups were investigated using NMR and density
functional theory calculation techniques. The C–F bond in perfluoroarenes
was activated by the para-position of an electron-withdrawing
group, such as CF3, C6F5, CN, and
NO2. The reaction of C6F4(SiMe3)2 mainly occurred at the para-position of the perfluoroarenes and also occurred at the ortho-position of C6F5CN and C6F5NO2. Two equivalent reactions of perfluoroarenes
with bifunctional p- and m-C6F4(SiMe3)2 provided disubstituted
perfluoroarenes, along with a small amount of protonated monosubstituted
perfluoroarenes. The reaction of o-BrC6F4SiMe3 with the CF3- and CN-substituted
pentafluorobenzenes provided unexpected coupling products between
C–Br and C–F bonds, in addition to the coupling products
between C–SiMe3 and C–F bonds.

Introduction
Fluorinated aromatic compounds are expected to have unique physical
properties because of the π-electron system connected with fluorine
atoms, which bring high electronegativity, low polarization, and high
bond energy to the C–F bond. Especially, bifunctional perfluoroaryl
units can be the basic skeleton for developing materials that have
peculiar properties. Past research on fluorinated materials has explored
a variety of applications. Partially fluorinated poly(arylene ether)s
have been developed for application as fuel cell membranes, and their
polymerisability and degradation during sulfonation were examined.1 A wide variety of bifunctional phenyl ethers
having tetrafluorophenylene or octafluorobiphenylene moieties has
been synthesized for optical or membrane applications.2 Tetrafluorophenylene-bridged bisphospholes were synthesized
to analyze their photophysical and electrochemical properties.3 Similar perfluoroaromatic molecules have been
explored for application to peptides and proteins; model cysteine
compounds were prepared by nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) with hexafluorobenzene and decafluorobiphenyl to study
stapled peptides.4 Perfluoroaromatic linkers
have also been introduced to the backbones of model peptides.5

The π-electron system associated with fluorine atoms has
interesting properties involved in molecular recognition and electron
transfer. Derivatives of decafluorobiphenyl and octafluoronaphthalene
could act as acceptors for an anion due to anion−π interaction.6 Polyfluorinated oxacalixarenes, which are potential
macrocyclic molecules to make “guest–host” complexes,
have been synthesized by reaction of perfluoro-m-xylene
with tetrafluororesorcinol.7 Aiming for
use as organic conductors in printable electronics, perfluoroterphenyl
derivatives were synthesized and studied for potential self-assembly
using X-ray crystallography.8 Other potential
fluorinated organic materials for electronic applications include
perfluorinated oligo(p-phenylene)s9 and perfluorinated phenylene dendrimers,10 which were synthesized and examined for an electron-transport
layer and an n-type semiconductor. Therefore, the
development of synthetic methods utilizing bifunctional perfluoroaryl
units is in demand by a number of industrial fields.

We have been investigating the trimethylsilyl-based transfer reagent
based on a pentafluorophenyl unit, C6F5SiMe3. The C=O bond of hexafluoroacetone reacts with C6F5SiMe3 to give perfluorinated aromatic
ether by further reaction with C6F5CH2Br.11 Both the C=N bonds of perfluorinated
cyclic imines12 and C=C bonds of
highly branched perfluoroolefins13 reacted
with C6F5SiMe3 to give the corresponding
pentafluorophenyl cyclic imines and olefins via an addition–elimination
(AdN-E) mechanism. Interestingly,
the para-position of the introduced C6F5 group in the resulting cyclic imines and olefins could
react further with C6F5SiMe3 molecules
to provide perfluorobiphenyl and/or perfluoroterphenyl products. In
cases of perfluorinated aromatic compounds containing electron-withdrawing
substituents, this multiple pentafluorophenylation occurred at both
the para- and ortho-positions of
the electron-withdrawing substituents, resulting in not only para-phenylenes but also m-phenylenes.14

A bifunctional trimethylsilyl-based tetrafluorophenylene transfer
reagent, p-C6F4(SiMe3)2, has been prepared from p-C6F4Br2 with moderate yields.15 Both trimethylsilyl sites reacted with aromatic aldehydes
to provide diols having the tetrafluorophenylene skeleton.16 However, reactions of p-C6F4(SiMe3)2 with fluorinated
compounds, which may exploit the π-electron system associated
with fluorine atoms, have not been reported. In the present study,
we suggest synthetic methods for introducing a perfluorophenylene
moiety into perfluoroarenes and investigate reactions of several perfluoroarenes
containing electron-withdrawing substituents with p-C6F4(SiMe3)2. In addition,
preparation of geometrical isomers of C6F4(SiMe3)2, which have not yet been reported, is examined
to expand the range of potential methods to introduce the tetrafluorophenylene
moiety.

Results and Discussion
By modification of the Ruppert method for C6F5SiMe3, 1,4-bis(trimethylsilyl)tetrafluorobenzene [p-C6F4(SiMe3)2] has been previously prepared using ClSiMe3 and P(NEt2)3.15 In this previous
method, although an excess of ClSiMe3 and P(NEt2)3 was used in refluxing hexane, the desired product was
obtained at relatively low yields. In the present study, anhydrous
CH3CN at a lower reaction temperature (−30 °C)
was used to prepare C6F4(SiMe3)2 from C6F4Br2. Using this
lower reaction temperature, p-C6F4(SiMe3)2 could be obtained at higher
yields than with the previous method. As shown in our previous study,14 pentafluorophenylation using C6F5SiMe3 could not progress for perfluoroarenes having
an electron-releasing substituent. Therefore, we focused on four perfluoroarenes
having electron-withdrawing substituents (X = CF3, C6F5, CN, and NO2) for the reaction of p-C6F4(SiMe3)2 (Scheme 1). The results
are summarized in Table 1.

Besides pentafluorophenylation using C6F5SiMe3, nucleophilic attack occurred only at the para-position of C6F5CF3 (1a). The reaction mixture of 1a with p-C6F4(SiMe3)2 became a white suspension, with p-C6F4(p-C6F4CF3)2 (4a) as a component of the suspended
phase. The disubstituted product 4a was obtained by the
reaction of both SiMe3 groups of p-C6F4(SiMe3)2 with 1a via an addition–elimination (AdN-E) mechanism.12−14 After removing the white
precipitate, the filtrate DMF solution contained a mixture of 4a and 4′-H(C6F4)(p-C6F4CF3) (3a). Evaporation
and successive Kugelrohr distillations provided both 3a and 4a as the isolated form. However, the protonated
monosubstituted product 3a was obtained at very low yield
because it was distilled out along with the DMF solvent. The protonated
monosubstituted product 3a formed from the trimethylsilylated
monosubstituted product, p-Me3Si(C6F4)C6F4CF3 (2a), which was not stable enough to isolate. Thus, it was
necessary to modify 4a by successive AdN-E reactions with 1a and
produce 3a by protonation.

The above reaction of p-C6F4(SiMe3)2 could apply to C6F5C6F5 (1b), which is a perfluoroarene
having an aromatic C6F5 group as the electron-withdrawing
substituent instead of the CF3 group. Similar to 1a, both C–SiMe3 bonds of p-C6F4(SiMe3)2 reacted
with 1b to produce linear p-(C6F4)(p-C6F4C6F5)2 (4b) predominately.
Since the disubstituted product 4b had lower solubility
in DMF, 4b was easily collected as a precipitate from
the reaction mixture. Meanwhile, the DMF solution filtered from the
reaction mixture contained the starting material 1b and
4″-H(C6F4)(p-C6F4C6F5) (3b). Although
the protonated monosubstituted product 3b was formed
at very low yield according to 19F NMR of the DMF solution, 3b could be isolated by Kugelrohr distillation. In the reaction
of 1b with C6F5SiMe3, multiple pentafluorophenylation occurred at the terminal C–F
bonds at the para-position, providing perfluorinated
oligophenylene products.14 Both 3b and 4b had a reactive C–F bond for the AdN-E reaction; however, the
reactions of p-C6F4(SiMe3)2 did not substantially occur for either 3b or 4b because the intermediate carbanion formed
from p-C6F4(SiMe3)2 had lower nucleophilicity than that formed from C6F5SiMe3.

As described in a previous report,14 reaction of C6F5CN (1c) with
C6F5SiMe3 occurred at both para- and ortho-positions of the CN group.
Even though the first attack of C6F5SiMe3 predominately occurred at the para-position,
the multiple pentafluorophenylation of C6F5SiMe3 occurred at both the para-position of the
introduced C6F5 ring and the ortho-position of the original C6F5CN ring. Therefore,
the C6F5CN (1c) with excess C6F5SiMe3 yielded the star-shaped 2,4,6-trisubstituted
derivatives. In the present reaction of 1c with p-C6F4(SiMe3)2, however, the attack on the ortho-position of the
CN group rarely occurred. Thus, the ortho-isomers,
4′-H(C6F4)(o-C6F4CN) (6c) and p-C6F4(o-C6F4CN)(p-C6F4CN) (7c), were
obtained as trace amounts in addition to the para-isomers, 4′-H(C6F4)(p-C6F5CN) (3c) and p-C6F4(p-C6F5CN)2 (4c). At the same time, the yield
of the protonated monosubstituted product 3c was much
higher than those of 3a and 3b, while the
yield of the disubstituted product 4c was comparable
to those of 4a and 4b. Our previous report
showed that the ortho-position of C6F5NO2 (1d) was less reactive against
C6F5SiMe3 than that of 1c;14 the reaction of p-C6F4(SiMe3)2 at the ortho-position of C6F5NO2 (1d) also occurred. That is, the protonation of the
silylated intermediate 2d provided 4′-H(C6F4)(p-C6F5NO2) (3d) as a major product, while 5d yielded 4′-H(C6F4)(o-C6F5NO2) (6d) as a minor product, similar to the case of 1c. Furthermore,
the reaction of the intermediates 2d and 5d with another 1d molecule gave p-C6F4(p-C6F5NO2)2 (4d) and p-C6F4(o-C6F5NO2)(p-C6F5NO2) (7d) as major and minor products, respectively.

Next, to examine substituent effects of perfluoroarenes on product
distribution, the syntheses and reactions of the positional isomer
of C6F4(SiMe3)2 were investigated.
As shown above, we improved the reaction procedure for the synthesis
of p-C6F4(SiMe3)2 over a previous work. The improved reaction condition could
apply to the meta-isomers of C6F4(SiMe3)2; 1,3-bis(trimethylsilyl)tetrafluorobenzene
[m-C6F4(SiMe3)2] was obtained from m-C6F4Br2 at slightly lower yields than the para-isomer, p-C6F4(SiMe3)2. Reactions of the same perfluoroarenes, having electron-withdrawing
substituents X (X = CF3, C6F5, CN,
and NO2), with m-C6F4(SiMe3)2 were examined in this study (Scheme 2). The results are
summarized in Table 2.

In the reaction of m-C6F4(SiMe3)2 with C6F5CF3 (1a), only the para-position
of the CF3 group was sufficiently reactive for the nucleophile
to produce m-C6F4(p-C6F4CF3)2 (10a) as a major product at 35% yield and 5′-H(C6F4)(p-C6F4CF3) (9a) as a minor product at 4% yield. The protonated
monosubstituted product 9a and the disubstituted product 10a were obtained from unstable monosubstituted silylate 8a by protonation and successive AdN-E reactions, respectively. In spite of the different
SiMe3 positions in the bifunctional trimethylsilylated
reagent, the product distribution in the reaction of m-C6F4(SiMe3)2 with 1a was almost the same as that of p-C6F4(SiMe3)2 with 1a. In the reaction of m-C6F4(SiMe3)2 with C6F5C6F5 (1b), the disubstituted product
[m-(C6F4)(p-C6F4C6F5)2 (10b)] was obtained at 13% yield, almost half the yield
of 4b, even though the yield of the protonated monosubstituted
product [5″-H(C6F4)(p-C6F4C6F5) (9b)] increased slightly to 8% (Table 2, entry 6), compared with 2% of 3b (Table 1, entry 2).

In the reaction of m-C6F4(SiMe3)2 with C6F5CN
(1c), even though the total yields of
the monosubstituted product [5′-H(C6F4)(p-C6F4CN) (9c)] and the disubstituted product [m-C6F4(p-C6F4CN)2 (10c)] were almost the same as the total yields
of 3c and 4c [from p-C6F4(SiMe3)2], the ratio between
the monosubstituted and disubstituted products was different for the para- and meta-reagents. Thus, 9c and 10c were obtained evenly (29 and 27% for 9c and 10c, respectively; Table 3, entry 7), while the disubstituted 4c was preferred to the monosubstituted 3c (39%
for 4c vs 16% for 3c, Table 1, entry 3). At the same time, both 5′-H(C6F4)(o-C6F4CN) (12c) and m-C6F4(o-C6F4CN)(p-C6F4CN) (13c) were
also formed at 3% yield for each (Run 7, Table 2) in contrast with the trace formation of
the ortho-isomers, 4′-H(C6F4)(o-C6F4CN) (6c) and p-C6F4(o-C6F4CN)(p-C6F4CN) (7c). The increases of the protonated
monosubstituted product and the ortho-positional
isomers were more prominent in the reaction of m-C6F4(SiMe3)2 with C6F5NO2 (1d). That is, the yield
of 5′-H(C6F4)(p-C6F4NO2) (9d) became larger
than that of m-C6F4(p-C6F4NO2)2 (10d), while yields of ortho-positional isomers
[5′-H(C6F4)(o-C6F4NO2) (12d) and m-C6F4(o-C6F4NO2)(p-C6F4NO2) (13d)] also increased. Therefore,
the increase of ortho-positional isomers was caused
by increasing stability of the silylated intermediate 11 because of resonance of the CN and NO2 groups. In addition,
the increase of the protonated monosubstituted product was caused
by lowering the nucleophilicity of monosubstituted silylate 8, becoming less reactive with other molecules 1.

Next, the reaction of o-C6F4Br2 with ClSiMe3 and P(NEt2)3 was examined for preparing o-C6F4(SiMe3)2, using the same preparation
procedure as that of p-C6F4(SiMe3)2 and m-C6F4(SiMe3)2. Although the white crystalline
material precipitated at −30 °C 3 h after the start of
the reaction, no desired o-C6F4(SiMe3)2 was found in the precipitate, only
1-bromo-2-trimethylsilyl-3,4,5,6-tetrafluorobenzene [o-Br(C6F4)SiMe3]. Neither longer
reaction time nor higher reaction temperature produced o-C6F4(SiMe3)2, even though
both longer time and higher temperature decreased the yield of o-Br(C6F4)SiMe3 in the
reaction. Furthermore, pure o-Br(C6F4)SiMe3 could not be collected from the precipitate
because it melted at ambient temperature. Vacuum distillation was
not able to isolate o-Br(C6F4)SiMe3 because the boiling point of the byproduct O=P(NEt2)3 is close to that of the desired o-Br(C6F4)SiMe3. Therefore, reactions
of the bifunctional trimethylsilylated reagent with perfluoroarenes
were performed using o-Br(C6F4)SiMe3, including 16 wt % of O=P(NEt2)3 (Scheme 3). The results are summarized in Table 3.

Scheme 3 In the reaction with o-Br(C6F4)SiMe3, the para-position of C6F5CF3 (1a) reacted with the C–SiMe3 bond while the adjacent C–Br bond was retained, giving
a monosubstituted bromide [o-Br(C6F4)(p-C6F4CF3) (14a)] at 16% yield (Table 3, entry 9). Very interestingly, the remaining
C–Br bond successively reacted with another 1a molecule at the para-position to provide the disubstituted
product [o-C6F4(p-C6F4CF3)2 (15a)] at 9% yield. In the reaction of o-Br(C6F4)SiMe3 with C6F5C6F5 (1b), monosubstituted bromide [o-Br(C6F4)(p-C6F4C6F5) (14b)] was formed at 8% yield (Table 3, entry 10). Even after the Kugelrohr distillation,
however, 14b was only obtained as the mixed form with
the protonated monosubstituted product [6″-H(C6F4)(p-C6F4C6F5) (17b)]. The formation of 17b indicates that the C–Br bond again participated in the Ar–Ar
coupling reaction with a yet unknown mechanism, probably through the
intermediate 16b.

Meanwhile, the reaction of o-Br(C6F4)SiMe3 with C6F5CN (1c) gave a monosubstituted bromide [o-Br(C6F4)(p-C6F4CN) (14c)] and a disubstituted product [o-C6F4(p-C6F4CN)2 (15c)] at relatively low yields
(6% for 14c and 5% for 15c, Table 3, entry 11). Similar to 1a, the product 14c was produced by the coupling
reaction between the C–F bond at the para-position
of CN of 1c and the C–Si bond of o-Br(C6F4)SiMe3, and successive coupling
reactions occurred at the para-position of CN of
another 1c molecule with the C–Br bond in 14c. The route to the protonated monosubstituted product 17 is only seen in the reactions of o-Br(C6F4)SiMe3 with 1b, but not
with 1a and 1c. The formation of 15 is also possible through the intermediate 16, and if
so, the intermediate 16 bifurcated only through 16b but not through 16a and 16c.
If this is not the case, the route to 16 is only operative
for 1b but not for 1a and 1c. It is not yet clear which of these synthesis routes can explain
the observed results. However, it is important to note that the C–Br
bond participated in the Ar–Ar coupling as well as the C–Si
bond under the experimental conditions. The products 15a, 15c, and 17b were totally unexpected,
so we carefully examined their 19F NMR data by density
functional theory (DFT) calculation to confirm their structures. The
unexpected Ar–Ar coupling between C–Br and C–F
bonds suggests further study, probably for developing a very new Ar–Ar
coupling reaction without any metal catalyst. That work, however,
is beyond the scope of this paper and will be the subject of a future
study.

The structures of the perfluorinated arenes synthesized in this
study were determined by 1H, 19F, and 13C{1H,19F} NMR spectroscopies and gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry (GC–MS). The NMR analyses gave valuable information
for the identification of the perfluorinated arenes having several
geometrical isomers. However, the signal of synthesized perfluorinated
arenes was significantly shifted due to the conjugated π-electrons
associated with the electron-withdrawing substituent; therefore, the
assignments of NMR signals were also confirmed by DFT calculations.
In our previous reports, when the DFT calculation was performed at
the B3LYP level using the gauge-independent atomic orbital (GIAO)
level with the 6-31++G(d,p) basis set, the chemical shift of poly-
and perfluorinated compounds could be reproduced unerringly.12,13,17,18 The usefulness of DFT calculations for spectral assignments of 13C, 15N, and 19F NMR spectra has been
reported.19,20 The present investigation confirmed that
the DFT calculation is also applicable for the 19F NMR
spectral assignment of such complex perfluoroarenes.

The geometries of the concerned perfluoroarenes were first optimized
using the DFT calculation at the B3LYP hydride functional with 6-31G(d,p).
On the basis of the geometry obtained at the B3LYP/6-31(G) level,
we further calculated NMR shieldings using the B3LYP-GIAO/6-31++G(d,p)
level for the signal assignment. Correlation between the experimentally
determined and calculated NMR chemical shifts is illustrated in Figure 1 (19F
NMR) and Figure 2 (13C NMR) for 9 and 10 [the products
in the reaction of m-C6F4(SiMe3)2] with the perfluorinated arenes, as typical
examples. The Cartesian coordinates of the optimized geometry with
the total energy are presented in the Supporting Information (Tables S1–S8). A comparison between the
experimentally determined and calculated NMR chemical shifts is also
given in the Supporting Information (Tables S9–S14).

Figure 1 Correlation between the experimentally determined and calculated 19F NMR shieldings.

Figure 2 Correlation between the experimentally determined and calculated 13C NMR shieldings.

The calculated 19F NMR shieldings showed reasonably
good agreement with the experimentally determined values, although
they tended to take slightly smaller values [Δδ(F) −0.19 to −7.82]. Larger differences were
observed for the CF3 groups [Δδ(F) −9.12 to −10.00] (Tables S9–S11). Among the perfluoroaryl cyclic imines, the difference between
calculated and experimental values in aliphatic fluorine was larger
than that in aromatic fluorine.13 According
to the assignment of the 19F NMR signal, the most significant
effect of the electron-withdrawing substituent appeared in the fluorine
adjacent to the substituent [CN (ca. −145 ppm) <CF3 (ca. −139 ppm) <C6F5 (ca. −136
ppm) <NO2 (ca. −134 ppm)]. The 19F
signal of the aromatic ring originating from C6F4(SiMe3)2 was slightly shifted by the electron-withdrawing
substituent in the disubstituted product, while its chemical shift
was changed by hydrogen and bromine atoms in the monosubstituted product.
The site of the perfluorinated arene (para or ortho) attacked by the electron-withdrawing substituent
could be easily determined by the signal patterns and chemical shifts
of aromatic fluorine atoms, which were well reproduced by the DFT
calculation.

In comparison with 19F NMR values, the calculated 13C NMR shieldings showed better agreement with experimentally
determined values [Δδ(C) −3.89
to 4.07], except for the signals of CF3, CN, and C-Br groups
(Tables S12–S14). The differences
between the calculated and measured values were smaller in aromatic
carbons connected with fluorine (135–160 ppm) than those of
aromatic carbons connected with another carbon ring (95–115
ppm). The CF3 and C-Br groups had similar calculated 13C NMR shieldings (124–128 ppm), which took on larger
values than the experimentally determined values, as follows: CF3 [Δδ(C) 6.18–7.14]; C-Br
[Δδ(C) 9.17–10.18]. Meanwhile,
the CN group exhibited smaller calculated 13C NMR-shielding
values (98–100 ppm) although the experimentally measured values
for the CN group were larger than the corresponding calculated values
[Δδ(C) −6.47 to −8.19].
For the experimentally determined 13C NMR shieldings, the
electron-withdrawing substituent significantly affected the carbon
directly connected with it in the following order: CN (ca. 97 ppm)
<CF3 (ca. 112 ppm) <NO2 (ca. 131 ppm)
<C6F5 (ca. 144 ppm). The tendency of signal
shifts due to the electron-withdrawing substituent gave beneficial
information for assigning signals to complicated perfluorinated arenes
that were present as several geometrical isomers.

As described above, bifunctional perfluoroarylsilanes, C6F4(SiMe3)2, are useful reagents
for manufacturing fluorine materials having not only bifunctional
units but also various positional isomers on biphenyl and terphenyl
skeletons. The electron-withdrawing substituents on these molecules
can be easily converted to a reactive site for another bifunctional
molecule having the terphenyl unit. The NMR analysis presented in
this study can also apply to perfluorinated arenes having several
aromatic rings, which may serve as fluorinated materials for industrial
applications. In the future, we are planning to investigate synthesis
and NMR analysis of fluorinated arenes having more complicated skeletons,
from the point of view of the utilization of perfluorinated materials
for a wide range of industrial fields.

Conclusions
Use of anhydrous CH3CN at a low reaction temperature
(−30 °C) produced 1,3-bis(trimethylsilyl)tetrafluorobenzene
[m-C6F4(SiMe3)2], as well as 1,4-bis(trimethylsilyl)tetrafluorobenzene [p-C6F4(SiMe3)2], from the corresponding dibromotetrafluorobenzene. This modified
method to prepare a bifunctional trimethylsilyl-based transfer reagent
could not be applied to the ortho-isomer; therefore,
it only provided 1-bromo-2-trimethylsilyl-3,4,5,6-tetrafluorobenzene
[o-Br(C6F4)SiMe3] instead of the desired product, [o-(C6F4)2(SiMe3)2]. In the
reaction of perfluoroarenes (C6F5X) having an
electronegative substituent (CF3, C6F5, CN, or NO2) with both p-C6F4(SiMe3)2 and m-C6F4(SiMe3)2, the para-position of the electronegative substituent reacted
with both the C–Si bonds to produce disubstituted perfluoroarenes
[C6F4(p-C6F5X)2]. This reaction proceeded via monosubstituted
silylates [C6F4(SiMe3)(p-C6F5X)], which were not isolable due to being
unstable, and yielded protonated monosubstituted perfluoroarenes [HC6F4(p-C6F5X)]. In cases of the conjugated bond (CN and NO2), the ortho-position was also attacked to produce positional isomers
[C6F4(o-C6F5X)2] and [HC6F4(o-C6F5X)] at even lower yields. Perfluoroarenes
also reacted with o-Br(C6F4)SiMe3 to provide monosubstituted bromide [o-BrC6F4(p-C6F5X)], along with unexpected Ar–Ar coupling products,
such as the disubstituted product o-C6F4(p-C6F4X)2 (X = CF3, CN) and a protonated monosubstituted
product 6″-H(C6F4)(p-C6F4X) (X = C6F5). The
combination of experimentally determined and calculated NMR shieldings
provided significant information for determining structures of complicated
perfluorinated materials with several aromatic rings, which can be
used in various industrial fields.

Experimental Section
General Remarks
The 1H and 13C NMR spectra were measured on a Varian INOVA-300 spectrometer with
CDCl3 as the solvent operated at 299.95 and 75.42 MHz,
respectively. The 19F NMR spectra were measured using the
same solvent and spectrometer operated at 282.24 MHz; positive δ
values were downfield from the internal reference, CFCl3. The GC–MS data were obtained with a JEOL jms-kg/STK Ultra
Quad GC/MS instrument, using electron-impact ionization at 70 eV.
The TD-GC–MS data were obtained with a Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010
Ultra instrument, which used electron-impact ionization at 70 eV after
the sample was sublimed from 100 to 600 °C. All solvents were
purchased as superdehydrated solvents commercially and were used without
further purification.

Preparation of 1,4-Bis(trimethylsilyl)tetrafluorobenzene
[p-C6F4(SiMe3)2]
A solution of 1,4-dibromo-2,3,5,6-tetrafluorobenzene
(2.00 g, 6.50 mmol) and chlorotrimethylsilane (1.48 g, 13.6 mmol)
in 5 mL of anhydrous acetonitrile was placed in a 100 mL round-bottom
flask with a three-way stopcock. The reaction mixture was stirred
in a dry ice-ethanol bath at −50 °C, and tris(diethylamino)phosphine
(3.38 g, 13.7 mmol) was added from a dropping funnel over 20 min.
After stirring at −30 °C for 3 h, the reaction mixture
became a yellow suspension. The white solid was collected by filtration
of the cooled reaction mixture at −30 °C and then was
washed twice with a small amount of the cooled anhydrous acetonitrile.
After the white solid was dissolved in anhydrous acetonitrile under
gentle heating at 50 °C, the solution was cooled at −30
°C to yield white crystals of 1,4-bis(trimethylsilyl)tetrafluorobenzene
[p-C6F4(SiMe3)2] with a mass of 1.14 g (3.86 mmol), a 59% yield. 1H NMR (299.95 MHz, CDCl3): δ 0.39 (SiMe3); 19F NMR (282.2 MHz, CDCl3): δ −129.31
(s, 2,3,5,6-F); 13C{1H,19F} NMR (75.4
MHz, CDCl3): δ 0.10 (SiMe3), 118.54 (1,4-C),
148.69 (2,3,5,6-C); GC–MS (m/z, %): 294 [M+, 100].

Reaction of Octafluorotoluene (1a) with p-C6F4(SiMe3)2
A solution of p-C6F4(SiMe3)2 (90 mg, 0.306 mol) and a catalytic
amount (10 mg) of KHF2 in 2 mL of anhydrous DMF was placed
in a 30 mL Teflon vessel, and then a solution of octafluorotoluene 1a (146 mg, 0.618 mmol) with 1 mL of anhydrous DMF was added
while gently stirring with a magnetic stirrer. After stirring at room
temperature (RT) for 20 h, the reaction mixture turned to a light-yellow
suspension. A white solid was collected from the suspension and was
purified using Kugelrohr distillation to provide p-C6F4(p-C6F4CF3)2 (4a) as white needles.
On the other hand, a light-yellow solid was obtained by evaporation
of the filtrate and was distilled by the Kugelrohr apparatus to provide
4′-H(C6F4)(p-C6F4CF3) (3a) as the lower-temperature
fraction and p-C6F4(C6F4CF3)2 (4a) as the
higher-temperature fraction. The yield of 3a isolated
from the Kugelrohr distillate was 2%, while that of 4a was 34%, isolated from the Kugelrohr distillates of both the precipitate
and filtrate.

Reaction of Pentafluorobenzonitrile (1c) with p-C6F4(SiMe3)2
A solution of p-C6F4(SiMe3)2 (90 mg, 0.306 mmol) and 10 mg of KHF2 in 2 mL of anhydrous DMF was placed in a 30 mL Teflon vessel,
and a solution of pentafluorobenzonitrile 1c (118 mg,

After stirring at RT for 20 h, the reaction mixture became a light-yellow
solution. The reaction mixture was evaporated to give a light-yellow
liquid with a white solid. Kugelrohr distillation provided mono- and
bis-C6F5CN substituted products in pure forms.
That is, the lower-temperature fraction provided 4′-H(C6F4)(p-C6F4CN) (3c) as a white solid, while the higher-temperature
fraction provided p-C6F4(p-C6F4CN)2 (4c). Positional isomers 4′-H(C6F4)(o-C6F4CN) (6c) and p-C6F4(o-C6F4CN)(p-C6F4CN)
(7c) were also obtained; however, 6c was
mixed with 3c and 7c with 4c, and none of these constituents could be isolated. The structures

Reaction of Octafluorotoluene (1a) with m-C6F4(SiMe3)2
A solution of m-C6F4(SiMe3)2 (95 mg, 0.323 mol) and 11 mg of KHF2 in 2 mL of anhydrous DMF was placed in a 30 mL Teflon vessel,
and a solution of octafluorotoluene 1a (154 mg, 0.652
mmol) in 1 mL of anhydrous DMF was added while stirring. After 20
h of reaction at room temperature, the mixture was a light-yellow
solution. This mixture was not evaporated but instead concentrated
for Kugelrohr distillation because of the low boiling temperature
products included in the reaction mixture. Kugelrohr distillation
at low temperature provided 5′-H(C6F4)(p-C6F4CF3) (9a) as the first fraction and m-C6F4(p-C6F4CF3)2 (10a) as the second fraction. The
mono-C6F5CF3 substituted product 9a was obtained at very low yield because most of 10a distilled out with the DMF solvent.

Reaction of 1,2-Dibromo-3,4,5,6-tetrafluorobenzene with Chlorotrimethylsilane
A solution of 1,2-dibromo-3,4,5,6-tetrafluorobenzene (2.89 g, 9.39
mmol) and chlorotrimethylsilane (2.04 g, 18.7 mmol) in 5 mL of anhydrous
acetonitrile was placed in a 100 mL round-bottom flask with a three-way
stopcock. The reaction mixture was stirred at −30 °C,
and tris(diethylamino)phosphine (4.64 g, 18.8 mmol) was added dropwise
over 10 min. After stirring at −30 °C for 3 h, the reaction
mixture became a light-yellow suspension. The reaction temperature
was maintained for 6 h, after which the liquid phase was removed from
the mixture by decantation. The residual white solid turned into a
two-layer liquid after being brought to room temperature. The lower
layer was collected and distilled under vacuum. The resulting clear
liquid was 1-bromo-2-trimethylsilyl-3,4,5,6-tetrabromobenzene [o-Br(C6F4)SiMe3]. A yield
of 0.705 g (2.39 mmol, a 25% yield) was obtained at 77–78 °C

Reaction of Decafluoro-1,1′-biphenyl (1b) with o-Br(C6F4)SiMe3
A mixture of o-Br(C6F4)SiMe3 (284 mg, 0.94 mmol) with 0.30 mmol
O=P(NEt2)3 was placed in a 30 mL Teflon
vessel. Anhydrous DMF (1 mL) and 12 mg of KHF2 were added
to the vessel, along with a solution of decafluorobiphenyl 1b (506 mg, 1.51 mmol) in 2 mL of anhydrous DMF. The mixture was gently
stirred at RT for 20 h, during which the mixture turned to an orange
solution The solution was evaporated to give a yellow solid. A mixture
of o-Br(C6F4)(p-C6F4C6F5) (14b) and 6″-H(C6F4)(p-C6F4C6F5) (17b) was obtained by subliming the solid and using the Kugelrohr distillation
apparatus. Although these substituted perfluoroterpheylyl products
could not be separated, their structures were determined in the mixed
form.

Reaction of Pentafluorobenzonitrile (1c) with o-Br(C6F4)SiMe3
A mixture of o-Br(C6F4)SiMe3 (268 mg, 0.89 mmol) and 0.20 mmol O=P(NEt2)3 was placed in a 30 mL Teflon vessel, into which 2 mL
of anhydrous DMF and 12 mg of KHF2 were added. When a solution
of pentafluorobenzonitrile 1c (311 mg, 1.61 mmol) in
1 mL of anhydrous DMF was added to the mixture under stirring, the
reaction mixture turned deep-brown immediately. The reaction mixture
was still a deep-brown solution after 20 h of stirring. The mixture
was evaporated to give a dark-brown oil, which was Kugelrohr distilled
to yield a first fraction of o-Br(C6F4)(p-C6F4CN) (14c) as a yellow liquid accompanied by O=P(NEt2)3. An orange oil with white crystals was obtained
as the second distillation fraction, from which o-C6F4(p-C6F4CN)2 (15c) was obtained as white needles
by washing with a small amount of CHCl3.

Computational Method
Density functional theory (DFT)
calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 program package.21 All geometries were optimized at the B3LYP hybrid
functional22,23 with the 6-31G(d,p) basis set.
Calculations of vibrational frequencies were performed at the same
level of theory to confirm minimum. Isotropic NMR-shielding tensors
were calculated at the B3LYP level using the gauge-independent atomic
orbital (GIAO) method24−26 with the 6-31++G(d,p) basis set. The 19F NMR shifts δ were calculated from the shielding (σ)
as δ = σref – σ, where σref is the shielding of CFCl3 (σref = 179.3792 ppm). The calculated 13C NMR shifts were derived
in the same fashion as the 19F NMR but using Me4Si (σref = 191.8000 ppm) as a reference.
