Combining the advantages of reactive
crystal facets and engineering
defects is an encouraging way to address the inherent disadvantages
of titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanocrystals. However, revealing
the true photoreactivity origin for defective TiO2 with
coexposed or predominant exposed anisotropic facets is still highly
challenging. Here, the photoreactivity of TiO2 nanocrystals
with respectively predominant exposed {001}, {101}, and {100} facets
before and after Ti3+ doping under both ultraviolet and
visible light was compared systematically. In detail, the photocatalytic
H2 production for R-TiO2-001, R-TiO2-101, and R-TiO2-100 increased by a factor of 1.34, 2.65,
and 3.39 under UV light and a factor of 8.90, 13.47, and 8.72 under
visible light. By contrast, the photocatalytic degradation of methyl
orange for R-TiO2-001, R-TiO2-101, and R-TiO2-100 increased by a factor of 3.18, 1.42, and 2.17 under UV
light and a factor of 4.03, 2.85, and 1.58 under visible light, respectively.
The true photocatalytic activity origin for the obtained photoreduction
and photo-oxidation ability is attributed to the exposure of more
active sites (under-coordinated 5-fold Ti atoms), the facilitated
charge transfer among {001}, {101}, and {100} facets, and the Ti3+ energy state with variable doping levels to extend the visible
light response. This work hopefully provides significant insights
into the photoreactivity origin of defective TiO2 nanocrystals
with anisotropic exposed facets.

Introduction
TiO2 has
been the most intensively investigated semiconductor
during the past few decades in the fields of photoelectrochemical
cell,1 photocatalysis,2−4 solar cells,5 sensors,6,7 biomedical treatments,8,9 and so on. It is highly demonstrated that the photoelectrochemical
properties of TiO2 are strongly dependent on the spatial
configuration, coordination, and structural state of surface atoms,
which is directly related to the exhibition on facets with different
surface structures and atomic configurations.10 Thus, facet engineering of TiO2 has attracted great research
interest in the past decade.11−13 According to the Wulff construction
model,11 the predicted equilibrium shape
of an anatase is a slightly truncated bipyramid enclosed by more than
94% {101} and fewer 6% {001} facets. The most stable {101} facet has
50% 6-fold coordinated Ti (Ti6c) and 50% 5-fold coordinated
Ti (Ti5c) atoms, while {001} facet contains 100% Ti5c atoms. The breakthrough in synthesizing micrometer-sized
TiO2 with 47% {001} and 53% {101} facets by Yang et al.14 ignited diamond fever in terms of the surface
structure and chemistry of anatase {001} and {101} facets. Other important
low-index facets, such as the {100} facet,15−17 which also
have 100% Ti5c atoms, may dominate when the truncated tetragonal
bipyramid is elongated, as predicted by Barnard and Curtiss.18

Although great progress has been made
to possibly verify the facets
related properties of TiO2 crystals, the true origins of
facet-dependent performance have rarely been demonstrated. Although
high-performance TiO2 materials can be finely tuned through
their surface and interface properties, some vital issues still need
to be carefully considered in the near future research. For example,
the generality of facet-dependent properties for a wide range of facets
with different materials and the evaluation criteria toward the influence
of surface reconstruction on the performance of micro- or nanosized
facets. Typically, Pan et al.19 prepared
microsized TiO2 single crystals with predominant {001},
{101}, and {010} facets to compare their facet-dependent photoreactivity.
Unexpectedly, they found that clean anatase {101} facets exhibit higher
photoreactivity than that of {001} facets. By contrast, {010} facets
showed the highest photocatalytic reactivity in generating OH radicals
and hydrogen evolution. Moreover, they attributed the photocatalytic
performance of faceted TiO2 to the band gap difference
(T010 > T101 > T001, established by ultraviolet–visible
spectra
and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)). However, the influence
of crystal size on the band gap of TiO2 and the transfer
and separation of charge carriers among different facets were neglected
in their work. In addition, Zhao et al.20 theoretically gave the following order of the work function values:
{101} > {010} > {001}. Moreover, the difference of preparation
method
and post-treatment may also have a great influence on the photocatalytic
activity of the crystal surface.

Despite the great superiority
of tailored faceted TiO2, however, facets unilaterally
cannot overcome all of the inherent
shortages, such as the weak visible light absorption and poor conductivity.
Thus, further modifications are indispensable to enhance the photoreactivity
of faceted TiO2 crystals. Among the variable modification
and regulation methods, reduced TiO2,21−2521−25 which contains Ti3+ species or oxygen vacancy, has been
considered to enhance visible light absorption and possess great potential
in photocatalysis, lithium-ion batteries, supercapacitors, fuel cells,
and photoelectrochemical sensors. Although Ti3+-doped TiO2 exhibits stronger visible light absorption, their visible
light-induced photocatalytic are still far from satisfactory. Besides,
theoretical calculations have shown that too high vacancy concentration
could induce a defective level below the conduction band, which may
act as new capture centers for charge carriers.26−28 Therefore,
these results demonstrate that Ti3+ doping may provide
plenty of room for preparing visible light-responding highly active
TiO2 photocatalysts. However, the underlying mechanism
and effects of Ti3+ in affecting the photocatalytic performance
of TiO2 are still under debate.

For crystalline TiO2, the photoreactivity is closely
related to the orientation of specific exposed facets as well as their
electronic structure in the surface and bulk. Thus, designing Ti3+ doping with highly reactive facets is used as a common strategy
to optimize the photoreactivity of TiO2. For example, Cai
et al.29 prepared Ti3+-doped
TiO2 nanosheets with 26.4% of {001} facets, which exhibited
enhanced photocatalytic degradation efficiency of rhodamine-B compared
with that of nondoped ones. Li et al.30 prepared oxygen-deficient blue TiO2 nanocrystals with
coexposed {101}–{001} facets to enhance the performance of
visible light-induced CO2 photoreduction. Notably, our
previous works have also highlighted the pivotal role of defects in
promoting the separation and transport of charge carriers and enhancing
the photocatalytic activity of faceted TiO2. However, the
defective TiO2 reported in the literature until now is
usually dominated by {101} or coexposed {001}–{101} facets.
So far, little attention has been focused on the engineering defects
in TiO2 nanocrystals with respectively dominated {001},
{101}, and {100} facets. Moreover, the true origin of enhanced photoreactivity
of faceted TiO2 crystals with various defective sites should
be explored in detail and systematically.

Herein, to fully use
the advantages of specified exposed facets
and defect effects, we have prepared Ti3+ self-doped anatase
TiO2 nanocrystals with respectively dominated exposed {001},
{101}, and {100} facets with a facile hydrothermal reaction followed
by a molten aluminum (Al) reduction method. The relationship of the
exposed facets, morphologies, and defects with the photocatalytic
degradation efficiency of methyl orange (MO), phenol, and H2 production under both ultraviolet and visible light range is carefully
revealed. The energy band structure and lifetime of charge carriers
was further established to explore the roles of exposed reactive facets
and defect sites on the photocatalytic activities.

Results and Discussion
The crystallization phase of all of the as-prepared samples was
identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in Figure 1, all of the TiO2 samples before and after Ti3+ doping present strong diffraction
peaks of anatase on the basis of the JCPDS Card No. 21-1272. No other
diffraction peaks were observed, indicating that the TiO2 obtained was of good purity.

Figure 1 XRD patterns of prepared TiO2 samples.

The morphology of the TiO2 samples after Al reduction
was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM), the images are shown in Figure 2. SEM (Figure 2A) and TEM (Figure 2D) analysis showed that the R-TiO2-001 sample consisted of well-defined sheet-shaped structures with
a rectangular outline, a side length of ∼130 nm, and a thickness
of ∼8 nm. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (inset of Figure 2D) clearly showed
that the lattice spacing parallel to the top and bottom facets was
∼0.235 nm, corresponding to the (001) planes of anatase TiO2. Based on the above structural information, the calculated
percentage of the (001) facets was about 82%. As shown in the SEM
images of Figure 2B,
R-TiO2-101 shows truncated bipyramidal morphology with
the top and bottom surfaces being found to be high-energy {001} facets,
and side surfaces remained {101} facets according to the literature.31 As shown in the insert HRTEM images of Figure 2E, the lattice fringe
with the spacing of 0.34 nm corresponded to the {101} planes of anatase
further indicating that the prepared samples are truncated tetragonal
bipyramids, which are enclosed by two {001} facets and eight {101}
facets. As for R-TiO2-100 shown in Figure 2C, all of the particles had well-defined
lateral facets with sharp edges, and the adjacent facets were perpendicular
as well as with the same width, which matches well with the equilibrium
crystal shape of tetragonal faceted-nanorods with four well lateral
{100} facets (shown in the insert model of Figure 2C). Furthermore, HRTEM images taken from Figure 2F indicate that three
sets of clear lattice fringes with the spacings of 0.35, 0.35, and
0.48 nm can be observed, which are attributed to the corresponding
(101), (101̅), and (002) planes of the anatase phase, respectively.
Based on SEM and HRTEM images, it can be concluded that the prepared
R-TiO2-100 sample has a single-crystalline structure of
the anatase phase with a growth direction along the [001] zone axis,
which means that the exposed lateral facets of the as-prepared R-TiO2-100 are mainly the {100} facets. Accordingly, the exposed
facet percentages of prepared TiO2 nanocrystals are calculated
and summarized in Table S1, according to
the SEM and TEM analysis as well as the equilibrium crystal shape
of anatase. To clearly observe the distinction in morphology between
TiO2 samples before and after Al reduction, the SEM images
of TiO2 with dominant {001}, {101}, and {100} facets before
Al reduction are also presented, as shown in Figure S1A, S1B, and S1C, respectively. Typically nanosheets, truncated
bipyramids, and tetragonal faceted-nanorod-shaped crystals can also
be clearly observed, indicating that the effect of Al on the morphology
of the as-prepared TiO2 samples is negligible.

XPS analysis was performed to explore the surface
states of prepared
TiO2 samples. As shown in Figure S2, XPS spectra of Ti 2p for TiO2 samples before Ti3+ doping exhibit two typical peaks, which are ascribed to
the Ti4+ states of TiO2. Specifically, the Ti
2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 of TiO2-001 peaks
at 458.87 and 464.63 eV, respectively, are ascribed to typical Ti4+–O bonds. As for TiO2-101 and TiO2-100 samples, the corresponding peaks are centered at 458.71 eV (Ti
2p3/2) and 464.39 eV (Ti 2p1/2) for TiO2-101, while the peaks are centered at 458.69 eV (Ti 2p3/2) and 458.87 eV (Ti 2p1/2) for TiO2-100 samples. It is reasonable for this discrepancy of binding energy
since each dominant facet of the as-prepared TiO2 samples
possesses the different atomic arrangements and configurations32,33 (i.e., the {001}, {101}, and {100} facets have 100, 50, and 100%
five-coordinate Ti (Ti5c) atoms, as shown in Figure S3A–C, respectively), the surface
electronic structures are therefore different. As for Ti3+-doped TiO2, the corresponding XPS spectra of Ti 2p are
identical to that of nonreduced ones after carefully comparing with
the original ones, which is mainly due to the relatively lower contents
of Ti3+ species. To quantitatively evaluate the contents
of Ti3+ and better understand the correlation of Ti3+ with the exposed facets, a Gauss fitting of Ti 2p peaks
was thus established to evaluate the Ti3+/Ti4+ fraction (i.e., peak areas ratio of Ti3+/Ti4+), as shown in Figure 3. Notably, it can be seen that small shoulders at 457.9 and 463.6
eV were observed, which is ascribed to the characteristic feature
of Ti3+ species.34,35 Moreover, the obtained
Ti3+/Ti4+ ratio in the three TiO2–x samples is on the order of R-TiO2-001
(0.058) > R-TiO2-101 (0.048) > R-TiO2-100
(0.032).
The obtained XPS fitting result is in good agreement with ESR analysis
and digital photography of the prepared TiO2 samples. Besides,
the XPS spectra of F 1s for TiO2-001 and R-TiO2-001 samples are also examined, as shown in Figure S4. The results indicate that the fluorine species on the surface
of TiO2 can be easily removed under both air and aluminum
atmosphere at 500 °C in our experiment. Besides, no XPS signal
of Al element was observed for the Ti3+-doped TiO2 (Figure S5A,B).

for TiO2 with different predominated
exposed facets after Ti3+ doping.

To further characterize the effects of Al atmosphere treatment
and detect the Ti3+ species, electron paramagnetic resonance
(EPR) measurement was conducted, as shown in Figure 4. For pristine TiO2 with different
dominant facets, a relatively weak paramagnetic peak at a g-factor
of 1.998 indicates the presence of Ti3+ in the bulk,36−38 while for R-TiO2-001, R-TiO2-101, and R-TiO2-100, a stronger and sharper peak appears at the same position,
suggesting that a large amount of Ti3+ species in bulk
was introduced by Al atmosphere treatment. It is reported that the
shape of the surface Ti3+ signal is usually broad, but
bulk Ti3+ has a narrow axially symmetric signal.39 In addition, it is considered that surface Ti3+ and subsurface Ti3+ showed dominant sharp signals
at g = 1.918 and 1.945, respectively.30,40 Furthermore, the relative intensity of the characteristic Ti3+ peak for each Al reduced TiO2 with dominant facets
was precisely examined, and the characteristic intensity ratio of
R-TiO2-100/R-TiO2-101/R-TiO2-001
is 0.26:0.96:1, implying that the concentration of Ti3+ for the reduced TiO2 is also different.

Figure 4 EPR spectra of TiO2 with predominated exposed {001},
{101}, and {100} facets before and after Al reduction.

Furthermore, the colors of the as-reduced TiO2 samples
further confirm the existence of Ti3+ compared with that
of nonreduced ones, as shown by their digital photograph presented
in Figure S6. Interestingly, we also found
that although the TiO2 with different dominant facets were
processed in Al atmosphere at the same temperature of 800 °C,
the color of the reduced TiO2 was rather different, showing
black (R-TiO2-001), dark gray (R-TiO2-100),
and light gray (R-TiO2-101), respectively. This indicates
that the exposed facets may have a certain influence on the doping
concentration of Ti3+. Moreover, UV–visible absorption
spectra are also provided, as shown in Figure 5A. The spectrum of Ti3+-doped
samples shifts to a longer wavelength revealing a decrease in the
band gap. Meanwhile, the absorbance in the visible range is strongly
enhanced compared to the unreduced ones. In addition, the absorption
intensity in the visible light range differs among the Ti3+-doped anatase TiO2 and shows an order of R-TiO2-101 > R-TiO2-100 > R-TiO2-001. The Kubelka–Munk
function is used to calculate the band gap energy of the prepared
TiO2, as shown in Figure 5B. The band gap of TiO2 before reduction
is estimated as 3.07 eV (TiO2-001), 3.13 eV (TiO2-101), and 3.09 eV (TiO2-100), while all of the values
decreased with varying degrees to 2.94 eV (R-TiO2-001),
2.63 eV (R-TiO2-101), and 2.69 eV (R-TiO2-100).

diffuse reflectance spectra (A) and curves of the
Kubelka–Munk function plotted against the photon energy (B)
for the prepared TiO2 samples.

Moreover, the pore structure-related properties were investigated,
as shown in Figure S7. All of the curves
can be classified as type IV isotherms (Figure S7A) with the presence of a hysteresis loop in the relative
pressure of 0.7–1.0. The adsorption/desorption isotherms of
the sample before and after Al reduction is about the same, indicating
that the Al reduction process has little effect on the porosity of
the prepared TiO2 samples. The hysteresis loop of TiO2-001 and R-TiO2-001 moved to a lower pressure zone
compared with that of the other four samples, indicating that the
specific surface area and pore size of the sample were relatively
smaller. As can be seen from Figure S7B, all of the prepared samples exhibited typical mesoporous structures.
The pore-size distribution of TiO2-001 and R-TiO2-001 samples is wide, which may be due to the agglomeration phenomenon
caused by the orientation attachment phenomenon among the {001} facets
of TiO2-001. Table S2 lists
the specific surface area and pore structure parameters of the sample.
It can be seen that the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)-specific
surface area of R-TiO2-001, R-TiO2-101, and
R-TiO2-100 is 21.7914, 24.3378, and 99.5281, which shows
a slightly decreased tendency relative to that of nonreduced TiO2-001, TiO2-101, and TiO2-100 with the
BET-specific surface area of 25.1059, 31.7491, and 103.7212, respectively.
This is possibly due to the tendency of agglomeration during the calcination
treatment in Al atmosphere.

The photocatalytic hydrogen production
performance was evaluated,
as shown in Figure 6. As shown in Figure 6A, the pristine TiO2 with different exposed dominant facets
produce different amounts of traced H2, exhibiting an order
of total hydrogen production during 5 h under ultraviolet (UV) light
with TiO2-001 > TiO2-101 > TiO2-100.
In contrast, all of the reduced TiO2 samples with dominant
exposed facets exhibit enhanced photocatalytic H2 production
compared with that of nonreduced ones, implying the Ti3+ doping does enhance the photocatalytic H2 production
performance. Furthermore, UV light-induced hydrogen production rates
of the prepared TiO2 samples is also systematically studied,
as shown in Figure 6B.

Figure 6 Time course of evolved H2 under ultraviolet (UV) light
(A) and visible light (>400 nm) irradiation (C) and the corresponding
H2 evolution rates under UV light (B) and visible light
(D) for TiO2 nanocrystal samples before and after Al reduction.

More specifically, the order of the calculated
hydrogen production
rates of the samples before and after reduction under UV light are:
1475.38 μmol/(g h) (R-TiO2-001), 1185.98 μmol/(g
h) (R-TiO2-101), 560.83 μmol/(g h) (R-TiO2-100), 1100.46 μmol/(g h) (TiO2-001), 446.89 μmol/(g
h) (TiO2-101), and 165.22 μmol/(g h) (TiO2-100). It should be noted that though R-TiO2-001 showed
the highest photocatalytic hydrogen production rate, its hydrogen
production rate was only 1.34 times that of the unreduced sample.
In contrast, the hydrogen production rates of R-TiO2-101
and R-TiO2-100 samples were far exceeding that of unreduced
ones by an increasing factor of 2.54 and 3.39, respectively. In addition,
Ti3+ doping does not affect the order of photoreduction
ability of different predominant crystal facets, and the order of
photocatalytic hydrogen production rate before and after Al reduction
still remains: {001} > {101} > {100}. In the case of TiO2 with different dominant facets before Al reduction under
visible
light irradiation, only a small amount of hydrogen can be traced (shown
in Figure 6C), indicating
that facets solely cannot overcome all of the deficiencies of TiO2 especially the weak visible light absorption and its corresponding
photoreactivity under visible light. However, after Ti3+ doping, the H2 production rates are tremendously improved
as shown in Figure 6D. To be more specific, the H2 production rates under
visible light irradiation for TiO2-001, TiO2-101, and TiO2-100 is 1.87, 0.95, and 0.54 μmol/(g
h) while the values of their Ti3+-doped counterparts are
16.65, 12.80, and 4.71 μmol/(g h), respectively. Here, it should
be emphasized that although the photocatalytic hydrogen production
performance of TiO2 samples after Ti3+ doping
is greatly enhanced under visible light irradiation, the growth rates
of H2 production for each TiO2 with dominant
exposed facets are distinctly different. To be specific, compared
with the H2 production rates of undoped TiO2 under visible light, the corresponding values are increased by a
factor of 8.90, 13.47, and 8.72 for R-TiO2-001, R-TiO2-101, and R-TiO2-100, respectively. It is reported
that the defective Ti3+ doping level below the conduction
band minimum of TiO2 is much lower than the redox potential
for H2 evolution. Moreover, electron mobility in the bulk
region is relatively lower due to this localization. Above are the
two main reasons to render the photocatalytic activity of the Ti3+doped TiO2 negligible.28,38,41

Moreover, the degradation efficiency
of MO under UV and visible
light (λ > 400 nm) irradiation was analyzed (see Figure 7). As shown in Figure 7A, no significant
removal of
MO was detected in the absence of the catalyst under UV light irradiation.
All of the Ti3+-doped TiO2 samples show enhanced
MO degradation rates (C/C0) compared with that of undoped ones after being irradiated under
UV light for 2 h. Among them, TiO2 with dominant {101}
facets exhibits the most excellent photocatalytic degradation performance
and almost 100 and 90% of MO was photocatalytically removed by R-TiO2-101 and TiO2-101 after 2 h, respectively. Moreover,
the corresponding pseudo-first-order kinetics rate constant under
UV light was also examined, as shown in Figure 7B. The reduced TiO2 samples exhibit
higher apparent kinetic rate constants of 1.734 × 10–2 min–1 (R-TiO2-001), 2.985 × 10–2 min–1 (R-TiO2-101),
and 1.142 × 10–2 min–1 (R-TiO2-100), while the undoped ones show lower kinetic constants
of 0.545 × 10–2 min–1 (TiO2-001), 2.101 × 10–2 min–1 (TiO2-101), and 0.526 × 10–2 min–1 (TiO2-100). More specifically, the kinetic
constants of R-TiO2-001, R-TiO2-101, and R-TiO2-100 increased by a factor of 3.18, 1.42, and 2.17 compared
with that of TiO2-001, TiO2-101, and TiO2-100, respectively. Visible light-induced photocatalytic degradation
of MO was also examined, as shown in Figure 7C. Although Ti3+-doped TiO2 exhibits enhanced photocatalytic degradation of MO under
visible light, the degradation rates (1 – C/C0) of MO after 2 h is dramatically
reduced to 50% for R-TiO2-101 compared with that value
of 100% under UV light irradiation. Given a prolonged illumination
time of 5 h, the obtained degradation rates (1 – C/C0) for R-TiO2-101, R-TiO2-001, and R-TiO2-100 is 0.78, 0.38, and 0.26, respectively.
Furthermore, R-TiO2-001, R-TiO2-101, and R-TiO2-100 exhibit enhanced kinetic constants of 4.11, 5.35, and
1.33 × 10–2 min–1 under visible
light irradiation, increasing by a factor of 4.03, 2.84, and 1.58
compared with that of TiO2-001, TiO2-101, and
TiO2-100, respectively (Figure 7D). Moreover, the photocatalytic degradation
of colorless phenol under UV light has also been examined, as shown
in Figure S8. Notably, the reduced TiO2 samples still exhibit the higher photocatalytic degradation
activity of phenol than the pristine ones, which is consistent with
the experimental results of MO degradation. To obtain a more clear
overview of photocatalytic changes of the prepared TiO2 samples, a comparative photocatalytic activity under different light
sources is summarized in Table 1.

To explore the Ti3+/Pt coupling or Pt location
difference
in facet dominated TiO2, the Pt particles were deposited
on reduced faceted TiO2 with different predominant exposed
facets by UV-irradiation-induced photoreduction methods, the corresponding
TEM images are shown in Figure 8. As can be seen clearly from Figure 8A,B, Pt nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed
on the whole surface including both {001} and {10} facets of R-TiO2-001 samples. It is reasonable for this phenomenon because
the defective Ti3+ sites are uniformly exited without selectivity
in the whole of bulk TiO2. Correspondingly, the in-situ
reduction of Pt4+ to Pt0 or other valence states
by defective Ti3+ sites is also dispersed uniformly without
selectivity (both on {001} and {101} facets). Loading metallic Pt
on the surface of TiO2 has often been employed as a co-catalyst
to separate the photoinduced charge carriers. Moreover, the loaded
Pt, which acts as an active site, could catalyze H2 evolution.
Thus, the homogeneous distribution of ultrafine Pt on Ti3+-doped faceted TiO2 was found to be possibly effective
for enhancing the photocatalytic H2 production. Moreover,
the ultrafine Pt particles were also dispersed uniformly without selectivity
on the whole surface of R-TiO2-101 and R-TiO2-100 samples, as can be seen from Figure 8C–F, respectively.

(Pt) nanoparticles loaded on (A, B) R-TiO2-001; (C, D)

UV light irradiation.

Recycling and stability
tests were evaluated by carrying out recycling
reactions five times for the photocatalytic degradation of MO over
R-TiO2-001, R-TiO2-101, and R-TiO2-100, as shown in Figure 9. All of the Ti3+-doped TiO2 samples
still retain good stability and durability after recycling 5 times,
keeping a MO degradation order of R-TiO2-101 > R-TiO2-001 > R-TiO2-100. To further address the recycling
and stability issues, the XRD patterns and TEM images of Ti3+-doped TiO2 nanocrystals after photocatalytic activity
tests were also provided, as is shown in Figures S9 and S10. All of the TiO2 samples still retained
a pure crystallized anatase phase and typical morphology (nanosheets
for R-TiO2-001, truncated bipyramids for R-TiO2-101 and tetragonal faceted-nanorods for R-TiO2-100),
indicating excellent stability of the as-prepared TiO2 samples.

degradation of MO solution over the as-prepared Al reduced TiO2 with different dominant exposed facets.

Furthermore, to observe the effects of Ti3+ doping and
exposed crystal facets toward the band structure of prepared TiO2, the valence band (VB) X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
are provided, as shown in Figure S11. Unexpectedly,
all of the as-prepared TiO2 samples display a typical VB
characteristic of TiO2, with an almost identical VB edge
of the maximum energy for specified dominated exposed faceted TiO2 before (Figure S11A) and after
(Figure S11B) Ti3+ doping, which
is similar to the reported defective titania.42 However, the valence band maximum (VBM) among different dominant
faceted TiO2 shows a small distinction. More specifically,
the VBM values for {001}, {101}, and {100} facets dominated TiO2 before and after Ti3+ doping are 2.54, 2.56, and
2.53 eV, respectively. As for the photocatalytic process, photoexcitation,
charge diffusion in bulk, and surface transfer of photoexcited electron
and holes are the three key steps. Correspondingly, the photoreactivity
is strongly depended on the comprehensive effects of absorbance, redox
potential, and mobility of charge carriers, which are determined by
electronic band structures as well as their surface atomic structure.
Consequently, the photoreactivity of the prepared Ti3+-doped
TiO2 crystals must be related to both its surface atomic
structure and surface electronic band structure.

Accordingly,
based on the UV–vis absorption and VB XPS spectra,
electronic band structures of the as-prepared anatase TiO2 crystals before and after Ti3+ doping were systematically
investigated, as shown in Figure 10. Among these facets, the {101} facet has the most
positive CB position, and the {100} facet before Ti3+ doping
has the most negative VB position. After Ti3+ doping, the
CB position exhibits a downward shift tendency while keeping the VB
position identical to that of non-Ti3+ doped ones. Specifically,
the CB position order is doped {101} facet > doped {100} facet
> doped
{001} facet > {001} facet > {100} facet > {101} facet, and
the VB
position order is {100} facet ≈ doped {100} facet < {001}
facet ≈ doped {001} facet < {101} facet ≈ doped {101}
facet. Thus, a {001}/{101} binary facet junction can be formed in
TiO2 with predominant exposed {001} and {101} facet, and
a {001}/{101}/{100} ternary facet junction can be also formed. The
resulting facet heterojunction is responsible for the transport and
separation of charge carriers, together with the variable facet energy
level, making the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 with
respectively predominated exposed facets to differ considerably.

Figure 10 As obtained
valence and conduction band edges of TiO2 nanocrystals
with dominated 001, 101, and 100 facets before and
after Ti3+ doping.

The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the prepared TiO2 samples excited at 320 nm are shown in Figure 11. The profiles of the emission spectra are
almost similar in which two main emission peaks at 397 and 427 nm
appeared. The first one is attributed to the emission of the band–band
PL process of anatase, while the latter is attributed to the excitonic
PL process at the band edge.43 As for pristine
TiO2, the PL intensity shows an order of TiO2-001 < TiO2-101 < TiO2-100, further highlighting
the key role of exposed facets in modulating the charge carriers.
However, after Ti3+ doping, the separation efficiency of
photoinduced charge carriers is just distinct. More specifically,
the observed PL peak intensity of both R-TiO2-101 and R-TiO2-100 is much lower than that of TiO2-101 and TiO2-100, indicating that certain amounts of Ti3+ doping
is beneficial to reduce the recombination efficiency of electrons
and holes, which generally favors high photocatalytic activity. However,
R-TiO2-001 shows the higher PL intensity in both of the
band–band and excitonic PL signals, indicating the higher recombination
rates of photoinduced charge carriers. This is because the high concentration
of Ti3+ forms new trapping centers of photoinduced carriers,
which is unfavorable to the separation and transport of carriers and
photocatalytic performance. To further understand the effects of Ti3+ and facets to the transport and separation of charge carriers
for the prepared TiO2 samples, transient fluorescence lifetime-based
technique was further utilized. The fluorescence decay curves were
further fitted using a biexponential function I(t) based on a nonlinear least squares analysis using the
following equation44,45  where τ1 and τ2 represent the decay time constants and A1 and A2 are the fractional
contributions of the time-resolved decay time of τ1 and τ2, respectively. The average lifetime (τavg) of the as-prepared TiO2 samples was calculated
using the following equation  To obtain a clear overview
of the fluorescence
lifetime difference among TiO2 samples with predominant
exposed facets before and after Ti3+ doping, the lifetime
of charge carriers measured by time-resolved fluorescence decay spectra
(shown in Figure S12). The fitted fluorescence
lifetime of TiO2 results is summarized in Table 2. As for TiO2 with
dominated exposed {001}, {101}, and {100} faceted samples before Ti3+ doping, the average lifetime was 8.748, 6.290, and 5.767
ns, respectively. After Ti3+ doping, the average lifetime
for R-TiO2-101 and R-TiO2-100 were significantly
increased, corresponding to 10.058 and 7.784 ns, respectively. However,
the R-TiO2-001 exhibited a relatively lower average lifetime
of 5.695 ns, further verifying that too much Ti3+ trapping
sites inevitably increased the recombination rates of charge carriers
and shortened the lifetime of photogenerated electrons and holes.

Based on the above results, we can now highlight the true determining
factors of photoreactivity of Ti3+-doped TiO2 nanocrystals with respectively dominant exposed {001}, {101}, and
{100} facets. First, exposure of anisotropic predominant crystal facets
endows different density of low-coordinated atoms, which always serve
as reactive photocatalytic sites. Second, the prepared binary faceted
system by {001}/{101} for TiO2 with dominant exposed {001}
or {101} facets and ternary faceted junction by {001}/{101}/{100}
for TiO2 with dominant exposed {100} facets may provide
a cascade path among two adjacent facets for the efficient transfer
and flow of photoinduced electrons and holes with different photoreduction
and oxidation capacity. Third, the defective Ti3+ energy
level may strongly be affected by the pristine electronic band structure
of TiO2 exposed with dominant {001}, {101}, and {100} facets,
which finally provide different driving forces for the photoexcited
e– and h+ and average lifetime of photoinduced
charge carriers.

Conclusions
We have demonstrated
that Ti3+ doping with respectively
dominated exposed {001}, {101}, and {100} facets on anatase TiO2 nanocrystals could favorably enhance the photocatalytic activity
of degradation of MO and H2 production under both UV and
vis-light irradiation. The distinguished optical absorption differentiation
is ascribed to the synergistic effects of both dominated crystal facet
exposure and variable Ti3+ doping concentration. As for
the photocatalytic H2 production, R-TiO2-001
demonstrated a much higher UV and vis-light-induced performance than
R-TiO2-101 and R-TiO2-100, showing an order
of R-TiO2-001 > R-TiO2-101 > R-TiO2-100, which is consistent with the order of nonreduced TiO2. Moreover, the photocatalytic H2 production under
UV
light for R-TiO2-001, R-TiO2-101, and R-TiO2-100 increased by a factor of 1.34, 2.65, and 3.39, while
a factor of 8.90, 13.47, and 8.72 was achieved under visible light.
In comparison, the photocatalytic degradation performance of MO under
UV light for R-TiO2-001, R-TiO2-101, and R-TiO2-100 increased by a factor of 3.18, 1.42, and 2.17, while
a factor of 4.03, 2.85, and 1.58 was achieved under vis-light. The
possible reasons for the differential ability of photo-oxidation and
photoreduction are the exposure of more active sites, newly formed
Ti3+ energy state with variable doping levels to extend
the visible light response, the facilitated charge carrier separation
and transfer among {001}, {101}, and {100} facets. Hopefully, this
work can provide significant insights into the photoreactivity effect
of Ti3+-doped anatase TiO2 crystals with dominant
exposed {001}, {101}, and {100} facets and make a contribution to
designing more efficient and stable solar fuel photocatalysts.

Materials
Titanium butoxide (Aladdin, ≥99.0%),
hydrofluoric acid (Aladdin, ≥40%), Degussa P25, potassium hydroxide
(KOH, AR), sodium hydroxide (NaOH, AR), and hexamethylenetetramine
(AR). All chemical reagents were of analytical grade and used as received
without further purification.

Synthesis
Preparation
of TiO2-001
TiO2 nanosheets
with dominated exposure of {001} facets were prepared by the hydrothermal
method similar to the methods reported elsewhere.46 Then, the obtained powder was treated in an electric muffle
furnace at 500 °C in air for 5 h and denoted TiO2-001.

Preparation of TiO2-101
The preparation
methods of TiO2 exposed with dominant {101} is used according to the
literature method.47 After that, the obtained
powder was treated in an electric muffle furnace at 500 °C in
air for 5 h and the prepared samples were denoted as TiO2-101.

Preparation of TiO2-100
TiO2 nanocrystals
with the predominated {100} facet were prepared by hydrothermal treatment
of titanate nanotubes twice as reported elsewhere.16 Then, the obtained powder was treated in an electric muffle
furnace at 500 °C in air for 5 h and the as-prepared sample is
denoted as TiO2-100.

Preparation of Ti3+-Doped TiO2 with Dominant
{001}, {101}, and {100} Facets
Ti3+-doped TiO2 nanocrystals were prepared by molten Al reduction according
to the literature reported elsewhere. In detail, the Al powders and
pristine TiO2 were separately placed in an evacuated two-zone
furnace and treated at 800 °C (molten Al) and 500 °C (TiO2) for 5 h in a 5 × 10–4 Pa pressure.
The as-reduced TiO2 was denoted as R-TiO2-001,
R-TiO2-101, and R-TiO2-100, respectively.

Pt loading on Ti3+-doped TiO2
Photoreduction
of the platinum (Pt) loading on Ti3+-doped
TiO2 nanocrystals was performed in a 100 mL Pyrex flask
containing 0.01 g of TiO2 powder, 5 mL of methanol, 0.5
mL of H2PtCl6 aqueous solution (1 wt %), and
45 mL of water at room temperature. The photoreduction time was conducted
on a 300 W mercury lamp for 0.5 h. After that, the powder was carefully
collected and washed with ethanol and water three times for further
analysis.

Characterization
The morphology
of the samples was
observed using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM;
JSM-6701F, JEOL) operated at an accelerating voltage of 5.00 kV and
equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer. Transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) analyses were conducted with a JEM-1200EX electron
microscope using a 200 kV accelerating voltage. X-ray diffraction
(XRD) measurements were performed on an X’ pert PRO diffractometer
using Cu Kα radiation at 40 KeV and 40 mA. The XRD patterns
were recorded from 10 to 70° with a scanning rate of 0.067°/s.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using an ESCALAB250Xi
photoelectron spectrometer with an Al Kα X-ray excitation source
to analyze the elemental composition of the samples. Ultraviolet–visible
(UV–vis) absorption spectra were collected using a Shimadzu
UV-2550 spectrophotometer at room temperature. ESR measurements were
carried out using a JES-FA200 spectrometer/X-bond under room temperature
at an X-band frequency of 9219.77 MHz, sweep width of 500 mT, and
center field of 500 mT. Nitrogen-adsorption/desorption isotherms were
obtained on an ASAP 2020M (Micromeritics Instruments) nitrogen-adsorption
apparatus. The fluorescence lifetimes of prepared TiO2 were
taken on a steady/transient fluorescence spectrometer (FLS-1000, Edinburgh
Instruments) to detect the lifetime of charge carriers for the prepared
samples. All of the samples were degassed at 80 °C prior to Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) measurements. The BET-specific surface area (SBET) was determined
by a multipoint BET method using the adsorption data within the relative
pressure (P/P0) range
of 0.05–0.3. The desorption branches data were used to determine
the pore-size distribution using the Barret–Joyner–Halender
method. The nitrogen-adsorption volume at P/P0 = 0.97 was used to determine the pore volume
and average pore size.

Photocatalytic Activity Measurement
Photocatalytic
hydrogen production: the photocatalytic H2 production was
examined in a Pyrex top-irradiation type reaction vessel connected
to a closed gas circulation system. Typically, 0.1 g of catalyst,
90 mL of deionized water, 10 mL of absolute methanol (as the sacrificial
reagents), and 0.5 mL of 1 wt % H2PtCl6 aqueous
solution were mixed uniformly and subjected to ultrasonic treatment
for 30 min. At the given time interval, gas chromatography (Agilent;
GC-7890A, MS-5A column, TCD, Ar carrier) was used to analyze the evolved
gases.

Photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange (MO): typically,
0.1 g of TiO2 sample and 100 mL of 20 mg/L MO aqueous solution
were mixed and subjected to ultrasonic treatment sufficiently. After
that, the suspension was magnetically stirred in the dark for 30 min
to ensure that adsorption–desorption equilibrium was achieved.
After light irradiation, the concentration change of MO was monitored
using a UV–vis spectrometer at 464 nm. As for reusability,
the photocatalyst was filtered and dried thoroughly after each cycle,
and then the fresh MO solution was added for further analysis. In
the case of the phenol degradation (phenol content characterized by
the absorbance peak at 270 nm), the experimental conditions are the
same as the MO degradation except for the amounts of catalysts (0.05
g) and concentrations of phenol aqueous solution (50 mL, 10–4 mol/L).
