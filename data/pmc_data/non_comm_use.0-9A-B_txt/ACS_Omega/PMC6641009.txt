The special electronic, optical,
thermal, and mechanical properties of graphene
resulting from its 2D nature, as well as the ease of functionalizing
it through a simple acid treatment, make graphene an ideal building
block for the development of new hybrid nanostructures with well-defined
dimensions and behavior. Such hybrids have great potential as active
materials in applications such as gas storage, gas/liquid separation,
photocatalysis, bioimaging, optoelectronics, and nanosensing. In this
study, luminescent carbon dots (C-dots) were sandwiched between oxidized
graphene sheets to form novel hybrid multilayer films. Our thin-film
preparation approach combines self-assembly with the Langmuir–Schaefer
deposition and uses graphene oxide nanosheets as template for grafting
C-dots in a bidimensional array. Repeating the cycle results in a
facile and low-cost layer-by-layer procedure for the formation of
highly ordered hybrid multilayers, which were characterized by photoluminescence,
UV–visible, X-ray photoelectron, and Raman spectroscopies,
as well as X-ray diffraction and atomic force microscopy.

Introduction
Carbon dots (C-dots),1,2 which were serendipitously
discovered during the purification of single-walled carbon nanotubes,3 have an almost spherical shape and sizes ranging
from 10 nm to a few nanometers. Their good solubility, low cytotoxicity,4,5 great compatibility,6 efficient functionalization,7 and chemical passivity8 make them suitable for applications in bioimaging,4,9 photocatalysis,10 drug and gene delivery,11,12 optoelectronic devices,13,14 nanoprobes,15 and sensors.16,17 The C-dots
can be synthesized by many methods, namely, laser ablation,18 microwave-assisted pyrolysis,19 thermal oxidation,20 arc discharge,3 electrochemical oxidation,21,22 ultrasonication,23 and combustion.24 Microwave-assisted pyrolysis, which was used
in this study, is a
preferable choice because of its low cost, facility, and efficiency.
A remarkable property of C-dots is photoluminescence; however, the
mechanism generating it is not yet well understood, but several potential
origins have been suggested, such as surface passivation, surface
groups, polyaromatic fluorophores, pairing of electrons and holes
on the surface of the C-dot, differently sized nanoparticles, and
structural defects.25,26

In this study, we aim at
arranging C-dots in two-dimensional (2D)
arrays. In fact, 2D materials have revealed outstanding and promising
prospects in science and nanotechnology in the last years because
of their unique properties in the fields of photonics, sensing, flexible
electronics, and energy harvesting.27,28 Graphene,
being a single-layered material with superior electronic, optical,
thermal, and mechanical properties, is ideally suited for layer-by-layer
(LbL) assembly. Novel functional materials29 with modified, optimized, or enhanced properties can be formed by
constructing pillared structures, where graphene sandwiches a variety
of guest moieties. Thus, the synthesis of a hybrid thin film, combining
the properties of C-dots and graphene, is a great challenge for potential
applications in the fields of sensing, catalysis, optoelectronics,
and biomedicine.

There have already been several efforts in
this direction; for
instance, Datta et al.30 prepared a hybrid
material combining chemically oxidized graphene (also known as graphene
oxide, GO) and C-dots for bioimaging and cell-labeling applications.
This material was synthesized via noncovalent interactions following
a self-assembly (SA) path. The fluorescence of the C-dots was not
majorly changed by the vicinity of GO, and their cytotoxicity remained
at a relatively low level. Another example is the work of Zhang et
al.,31 who synthesized a composite material
via a direct assembly of C-dots on the layered double hydroxide (LDH)
surface. This hybrid material is an excellent absorber of methyl blue,
making it suitable for the removal of anionic organic dyes.

In this study, a facile and low-cost bottom-up LbL approach, which
combines the Langmuir–Schaefer (LS) method with the SA technique,
was used for the production of a new class of highly ordered C-dot
intercalated graphene structures.32 This
method uses GO nanosheets as platform for grafting C-dots in a 2D
configuration and allows for perfect LbL growth.33 This precise control combined with the possibility to cover
large substrates in a homogeneous manner makes the LB technique promising
for preventing the aggregation of carbon-based nanostructures, such
as fullerene derivatives or C-dots,34−36 in hybrid multilayers.

For our thin-film preparation approach, the C-dots (with a mean
diameter of 4 nm) were produced by microwave-assisted pyrolysis,37 using citric acid, which acts as the carbon
source, and urea, which offers hydrophilic amine groups on the surface
of the C-dots. Suspensions of GO (prepared as described below) in
ultrapure water were used as subphase in the Langmuir–Blodgett
(LB) deposition system. As described in our previous work,32,38 spreading the long-chain molecule octadecylamine (ODA) on the water
surface triggers the GO to covalently bond via the amide functionality.
This results in the formation of a Langmuir film of ODA-GO on the
water surface, the packing of which can be modified by applying an
external pressure through the movable barrier of the LB apparatus.
The hybrid Langmuir film was transferred to a hydrophobic support
(hydrophobicity increases the transfer ratio) by horizontally lowering
it (known as LS method) to touch the ODA-GO/water interface. After
lifting the substrate again from the interface, it was lowered into
an aqueous dispersion of C-dots to induce SA of the latter on the
GO sheets. By repeating this cyclic procedure, hybrid multilayer films
were fabricated and characterized by photoluminescence, UV–vis,
X-ray photoelectron (XPS), and Raman spectroscopies, as well as X-ray
diffraction (XRD) and atomic force microscopy (AFM).

Results and Discussion
Structural
and Morphological Characterization of Pristine C-Dots
C-dots
were synthesized by employing the microwave-assisted pyrolysis
procedure applied by Qu et al.37 According
to them, water-soluble luminescent C-dots decorated with terminal
amine groups on the surface of the dots, exhibiting relative stable
physicochemical and optical features, are obtained. A detailed characterization
of the produced C-dots (including XRD, Fourier transform infrared
(FT-IR), UV–vis, and XPS measurements, as well as optical images
of their aqueous suspensions and films under UV light) confirms these
conclusions and is presented in Supporting Information. PL spectra of the C-dot aqueous dispersions with excitation wavelengths
from 300 to 460 nm are shown in Figure 1. These spectra are typical of C-dots7,18 exhibiting excitation-dependent photoluminescence with emission
red-shifting from ∼425 up to ∼525 nm with increasing
excitation wavelength. The maximum fluorescence intensity with emission
at 447 nm is observed when the C-dots are excited at 360 nm. The broad
emission bands, as well as the appearance of two distinctive peaks
in Figure 1e spectrum
or shoulders in other spectra, as at ∼500 nm in the case of Figure 1d, reveal the complicated
mechanism of the C-dot fluorescence.39 The
presence of various surface groups and traps leads to many dissimilar
states, which can be involved in the emission process and thus also
explains the excitation-dependent nature of the C-dot photoluminescence.39

nm, (f) 400 nm, and (g) 460 nm.

To image pristine C-dots, we adopted a deposition procedure,
in
which we first transferred a stearic acid Langmuir film on a Si wafer
and then horizontally dipped it into the C-dot dispersion to induce
SA (for details of the procedure, see Supporting Information). AFM images of such a stearic acid/C-dot hybrid
monolayer are shown in Figure 2. Isolated and uniform particles are observed, confirming
that combining the LS technique with SA34,35,40 avoids the aggregation of C-dots. From the topographical
height profile (section analysis), the height of particles is found
to be about 4.2 ± 0.2 nm, as derived, whereas their average height
deduced from the depth-analysis histogram37 is 4.5 ± 0.2 nm.

Structural Control and
Characterization of Hybrid ODA-GO/C-Dot
Monolayers
Π–a isotherms of ODA Langmuir films
on pure water and on an aqueous GO dispersion (20 ppm) are shown in Figure 3 (all of the recorded
Π–a
isotherms at various concentrations of 5, 7, 15, 30, and 40 ppm are
shown in Supporting Information). The curves
show the change in the slope corresponding to the phase transitions
of ODA-GO sheets from a 2D gas to a 2D liquid and then to a 2D solid
during the compression process.32,41 In the absence of GO,
the Π–a isotherm is a smoothly increasing curve with
a liftoff area of 32.8 Å2. When adding a small amount
of GO (0.02 mg mL–1) to the aqueous subphase, the
liftoff area increases to 52 Å2, which demonstrates
that the GO flakes stabilize the ODA layer32 through covalent grafting of the terminal amine groups of ODA to
the epoxides of the GO sheets via nucleophilic substitution reactions.42−44 Finally, representative AFM images of hybrid ODA-GO layers deposited
on Si wafer (see Supporting Information) at different surface pressures reveal the homogeneity of the produced
monolayers and the precise control of the surface coverage.

and on an aqueous dispersion of GO.

Representative AFM images of the first hybrid ODA-GO/C-dot
monolayer
deposited on Si wafer by combining the LS method with SA are presented
in Figure 4. The topographic
images show that the surface coverage of the substrate is quite high;
GO layers with well-defined edges are almost contacting each other
with small voids between them. This closely packed homogeneous array
demonstrates the highly controllable formation of ODA-GO/C-dot hybrid
layers.32 The average thickness of the
flakes is 1.0–1.5 nm, as derived from the topographical height
profile (section analysis), corresponding to the size of single GO
layers,45 which is 6.1 Å. Moreover,
uniform particles can be observed on top of the GO layers. The average
size (section analysis) of these particles is 4.5–5.0 nm, corresponding
to the exact size of the pristine C-dots (see Figure 2).

hybrid monolayers

Raman spectra of ODA-GO/C-dot and ODA-GO hybrid monolayers
deposited
on Si wafer are presented in Figure 5. Both spectra display characteristic D- and G-bands
associated with sp3 and sp2 hybridized carbon
atoms, respectively.46,47 Because of the presence of ODA,
the D-band intensity is significantly enhanced for the ODA-GO layer,
which is also reflected in the ratio of the intensities of D-band
to G-band (ID/IG) that is frequently used to express the degree of functionalization
of graphene materials and amounts to 1.22. In contrast, ID/IG decreases to 1.04 when
C-dots are added to the hybrid system, in agreement with the Raman
spectrum of C-dots alone, where ID/IG = 0.95 (Figure S6). Both spectra exhibit three broad bands at ∼2700, ∼2930,
and ∼3180 cm–1, which are linked to the 2D
vibrational mode, D + D′ mode, and 2D′ mode, respectively.46−49 Although no shifting of the peaks is observed, the grafting of the
C-dots enhances the intensity of the bands in the 2D region. We can
therefore conclude that the change in ID/IG and the increase of intensity in
the 2D region indicate the successful attachment of C-dots on the
surface of ODA-GO and hence the formation of the ODA-GO/C-dot hybrid
monolayer.

Characterization of Graphene/C-Dot
Hybrid Films
The
XRD pattern of a 60-layer-thick graphene/C-dot hybrid multilayer compared
to that of a ODA-GO/ODA hybrid multilayer constructed under the same
conditions is shown in Figure 6. The graphene/C-dot hybrid multilayer shows the 001 diffraction
peak below 2° (2θ), indicating the successful intercalation
of C-dots between the organomodified GO sheets. Because this peak
also partially overlaps with the (000) beam, we also report the spectrum,
where a baseline was subtracted (see red line in Figure 6). The position of the 001
peak at 2θ = 1.7° corresponds to a d001-spacing of 52.0 ± 0.1 Å. The position of the
003 reflection peak at 5.1° confirms this result. The d001 value of 52.0 Å is much higher than
the corresponding value of a hybrid organo-GO multilayer (d001 = 37.6 ± 0.1 Å), where instead
of the C-dots, a second ODA molecule is grafted in the SA step. In
fact, we propose that the hydrophilic terminal groups of C-dots interact
with the first GO layer and simultaneously interpenetrate the flexible
organic chains of ODA molecules covalently attached on the second
GO layer (see inset).

hybrid
multilayer and a 60-layer-thick ODA-GO/ODA multilayer.

The C 1s core-level X-ray photoemission spectrum
of a 60-layer-thick
ODA-GO/C-dot hybrid multilayer is shown in Figure 7 and compared to the spectra of pristine
bulk GO and of C-dots. The C 1s core-level X-ray photoemission spectrum
of graphene oxide reveals the different oxygen functional groups emerging
after the oxidation. More specifically, the contribution at 288.1
eV is due to carbonyl (C=O) groups and makes up 11.0% of the
total carbon intensity; the peak due to epoxy (C–O–C)
functional groups is located at 286.9 eV and contributes to 32.5%
of the total carbon intensity. Two peaks centered at 285.5 and 289.1
eV stem from the C–O and C(O)O bonds and represent 34.5 and
17.8% of the total carbon 1s peak intensity, respectively. Additionally,
one identifies the peak at 284.6 eV arising from the C–C and
C–H bonds of the hexagonal lattice and accounting for 4.2%
of the total carbon intensity. On the other hand, the C 1s photoelectron
spectrum of C-dots comprises three peaks that are assigned to C–C
and/or C–H bonds (66.7% of the total spectral intensity), C–O
and/or C–N bonds (21.0%), and C=O bonds (12.3%). The
spectrum of the hybrid multilayer consists of the following five components.
The first peak at 284.6 eV is due to C–C and C–H bonds
contributing only 6.9% to the total C 1s intensity. The main component
at 285.6 eV (61.0%) is ascribed to the C–O and C–N bonds
and arises from the hydroxyl moieties of both GO and C-dots as well
as from the amine groups of ODA and C-dots. The third peak at 286.6
eV (11.8%) is assigned to the C–O–C epoxide/ether groups;
this peak is significantly reduced compared with the GO photoelectron
spectra due to the bond between the amine end groups of C-dots and
the epoxy groups of GO. Finally, the peak at 287.7 eV (17.0%) represents
the ketonic functionalities (C=O), and the smallest contribution
(3.3%) at 288.9 eV comes from carboxyl groups (O–C=O).
The high intensity of the C–O/C–N peak and the significant
contribution of the carbonyl groups imply that the C-dots bear both
oxygen- and nitrogen-containing surface functional groups, as confirmed
by the FT-IR and XPS spectra of the pristine C-dots in Supporting Information.

photoemission spectra of GO (top panel),
C-dots (middle panel), and graphene/C-dot hybrid multilayer (bottom

The UV–vis absorption spectrum
of the 60-layer-thick ODA-GO/C-dot
hybrid multilayer deposited on quartz substrates is presented in Figure 8 (left). It also
shows an ascending absorption profile from lower to higher energies
with a tiny absorption step at around 300 nm. The latter as well as
the overall absorption characteristics of the material are correlated
to the presence of C-dots in the interlayer space of the hybrid multilayer.
Furthermore, the transparency can be controlled by adjusting the number
of the deposited layers: a 30-layer film is 96% transparent at 550
nm, whereas the transparencies of 45- and 60-layer films decrease
to 86 and 66%, respectively (Figure 8, right). These values are considerably higher than
those of other graphene-based films reported in the literature.50−55

absorption spectrum of a 60-layer-thick ODA-GO/C-dot
hybrid multilayer deposited on quartz (left), and transparencies (at
550 nm) for different thicknesses of the deposited hybrid layers (right).

As expected, the hybrid multilayers
display photoluminescence because
of the presence of C-dot. The PL spectra of the ODA-GO/C-dot hybrid
multilayer collected with excitation wavelengths from 280 to 440 nm
are shown in Figure 9. Once again, the excitation-dependent photoluminescence characteristic
of C-dots is observed. As the excitation wavelength varies from 280
to 440 nm, emission shifts from ∼356 up to ∼555 nm.
In contrast to the pristine C-dots, the maximum fluorescence intensity
of the hybrid multilayer is observed when exciting at high energy
(280 nm) and produces an emission peaked at 356 nm. Moreover, the
emission peaks are significantly narrower compared to the peaks of
the PL spectra of pristine C-dots. The latter two facts suggest that
either only smaller C-dots were incorporated in the interlayer space
of GO, as also suggested by the AFM analysis, or the interparticle
interactions between C-dots are much smaller in the hybrid multilayer;
of course, also both hypothesis could be true. In any case, the hybrid
multilayers exhibit adjustable and high-quality photoluminescence
with narrow emission lines.

hybrid multilayers
with excitation wavelengths from 280 to 440 nm.

Furthermore, it is important to note that the ODA-GO/C-dot
hybrid
films do not appear to exhibit any PL quenching phenomena. This fact
can be deduced by comparing the number of C-dots accessible by the
PL excitation beam, with a 3 mm × 3 mm frontal area, in a 60-layer
film to the number of C-dots accessed when the beam passes through
the pristine C-dot aqueous dispersion, where the depth of the source-beam
penetration is assumed 5 mm and all self-absorption effects have been
excluded. Assuming that three C-dots are positioned on each graphene
sheet, spaced 50 nm from each other in both directions, it can be
estimated that the number of accessible C-dots is 216 × 109. On the contrary, if the beam accesses an aqueous dispersion
of C-dots, where each C-dot has a mass density of 2 g/cm3 and a radius of 2.5 nm, and the dispersion was prepared as 0.15
g of C-dots/mL of H2O, the number of C-dots accessible
by the beam is 2.2 × 1013. Thus, the number of C-dots
interrogated in the ODA-GO/C-dot film is 100 times less than those
being observed in the dispersion. Therefore, if the C-dots within
the ODA-GO/C-dot suffered any PL quenching, their already lower concentration
would not have provided such a strong PL signal. In fact, as recently
reported by Vassilakopoulou et al.,56 C-dots
encapsulated in MCM-41 continue to exhibit their PL signal without
quenching while being protected by the matrix.

Conclusions
In summary, a low-cost and highly controllable LbL synthetic approach
for the preparation of a new class of hybrid intercalated graphene
structures is presented. A hybrid multilayer consisting of luminescent
C-dots sandwiched between GO layers was successfully fabricated by
combining the LS method with SA. This approach allows for a tunable
coverage, uniformity over extended surface areas, and single-layer-level
control of the assembly, as confirmed by Π–a isotherms
and AFM. XRD measurements revealed the presence of the C-dots within
graphene nanosheets and confirmed the highly ordered structure of
the hybrid multilayer. We postulate that the hydrophilic terminal
groups of C-dots interact with the GO layer above while at the same
time being trapped within the flexible organic chains of the organic
surfactant (ODA) that is covalently attached on a second GO layer
below. The existence of C-dots in the hybrid multilayer system was
corroborated by XPS, whereas Raman spectroscopy showed that the insertion
of C-dots between the GO nanosheets left the electronic structure
of GO unaffected. The transparency of the hybrid multilayers can be
controlled by adjusting the number of deposited layers and is considerable
higher than that of other graphene-based films reported in the literature.
Finally, the hybrid multilayers exhibit adjustable and high-quality
photoluminescence with narrow emission lines. The ODA-GO/C-dot multilayer
constitutes a novel hybrid system suitable for being employed in diverse
applications, such as nanoprobes, sensors, optoelectronic devices,
and transparent electrodes, as well as in the fields of photocatalysis
and drug delivery. Moreover, another potential application of the
produced graphene/C-dot hybrid thin films is in light-emitting diodes
(LEDs). Recently, Zhang et al.57 have fabricated
a carbon-dot-based LED, where the color of the light emitted from
the C-dots is voltage dependent, and with increasing bias, the emission
peaks also became stronger.57 In our hybrid
system, the use of graphene as a template could play an important
role because the conductivity of graphene can enhance the voltage-dependent
color emission of C-dots, favoring the development of colorful and
brighter LEDs with multicolor single pixels.

Experimental Section
Materials
Citric acid (99%), urea (98%), ODA (99%),
acetone, methanol, and ethanol were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich,
whereas nitric acid (65%), sulfuric acid (95–97%), potassium
chlorate, and powder graphite (purum, ≤0.2 mm) were acquired
from Fluka. Ultrapure water (18.2 MΩ) was produced by a Millipore
Simplicity system. The Si wafers (P/Bor, single-side polished, Si-Mat)
and quartz substrates (Aldrich) were cleaned before use for 15 min
in an ultrasonic bath with water, acetone, and ethanol. All reagents
were of analytical grade and used without further purification.

Synthesis of GO
GO was produced from graphite using
a modified Staudenmaier method.42,58−60 In a typical synthesis, 10 g of powdered graphite was added to a
mixture of 400 mL of 95–97% H2SO4 and
200 mL of 65% HNO3, and the mixture was cooled in an ice–water
bath. Powdered KClO3 (200 g) was added to the mixture in
small portions under vigorous stirring and cooling in the ice–water
bath. The reaction was quenched after 18 h by pouring the mixture
into ultrapure water, and the oxidation product was washed until the
pH reached 6.0. The above oxidation procedure was repeated two more
times and finally the sample was dried at room temperature.

Synthesis
of C-Dots
C-dots were synthesized using microwave-assisted
pyrolysis.37 More specifically, 3 g of
citric acid and 3 g of urea were dissolved in 10 mL of distilled deionized
water to form a transparent solution. The solution was heated in a
microwave oven (750 W, HOME, HMG23_8EL) for 5 min and subsequently
heated in a drying oven at 65 °C overnight. A certain amount
of water was added to the obtained solid, forming a dark brown aqueous
dispersion, which was filtered to remove large particles. The C-dots
were used immediately after the filtration or kept in dark for later
use. It is noteworthy to mention that the C-dots are quite sensitive
to light, as their color changes from dark orange to light orange,
then yellow, and finally light yellow after a couple of weeks of exposure
to light.

Preparation of Hybrid Graphene/C-Dot Multilayers
An
LB trough (KSV 2000 NIMA Technology) was cleaned with ethanol and
distilled deionized water. GO suspensions in ultrapure water (0.02
mg mL–1) were used as subphase, and a Pt Wilhelmy
plate was employed to monitor the surface pressure during the compression
and deposition procedures. For the formation of a GO film in the air–water
interface, 200 μL of a 0.2 mg mL–1 ODA solution
in chloroform/methanol (9:1 v/v) was spread onto the subphase using
a microsyringe. After a waiting time of 20 min for the occurrence
of solvent evaporation and the GO-surfactant functionalization, the
hybrid ODA-GO layer was compressed at a rate of 5 mm min–1 until the target surface pressure of 20 mN m–1 was reached, forming a dense ODA-GO Langmuir layer.32 This pressure was maintained throughout the deposition
process. The layers were transferred onto the hydrophobic substrates
by the LS technique (horizontal dipping), with downward and lifting
speeds of 10 and 5 mm min–1, respectively. After
the transfer of the ODA-GO layer to substrates, the hybrid GO film
was dipped into an aqueous dispersion of C-dots (0.2 mg mL–1) to induce the formation of a graphene/C-dot hybrid layer (ODA-GO/C-dot)
by SA. A hybrid multilayer film was formed by repeating this cyclic
procedure 60 times, as shown in Scheme 1. After each deposition step, the substrates were rinsed
several times by dipping into ultrapure water (to remove any weakly
attached cations or molecules that remained from the deposition steps)
and dried with nitrogen flow (to avoid contaminating the aqueous dispersion
in the LB trough and/or the C-dot dispersion32,41). Hydrophobic Si wafers and surfactant-treated quartz substrates
(see Supporting Information for quartz
modification) were used for the deposition of the hybrid films.

of the Hybrid GO/C-Dot Multilayer Film
Characterization Techniques
AFM images were collected
in tapping mode with a Bruker Multimode 3D Nanoscope using a microfabricated
silicon cantilever type TAP-300G, with a tip radius of <10 nm and
a force constant of approximately 20–75 N m–1. Hybrid monolayers were deposited onto silicon wafers by combining
the LS method with SA. Raman spectra were recorded on a Micro-Raman
system RM 1000 RENISHAW using a laser excitation line at 532 nm. A
0.5–1 mW laser power was used with a 1 μm focus spot
to avoid photodecomposition of the hybrid monolayers. XPS measurements
were performed at a base pressure of 5 × 10–10 mbar in a SPECS GmbH spectrometer equipped with a monochromatic
Mg Kα source (hv = 1253.6 eV) and a PHOIBOS
100 hemispherical analyzer. The energy resolution was set to 0.3 eV,
and the photoelectron take-off angle was 45° with respect to
the surface normal. All binding energies were referenced to the C
1s core level at 284.6 eV. The spectral analysis included a Shirley
background subtraction and peak deconvolution employing mixed Gaussian–Lorentzian
functions, in a least-squares curve-fitting program (WinSpec) developed
at the Laboratoire Interdisciplinaire de Spectroscopie Electronique,
University of Namur, Belgium. Hybrid multilayers were deposited onto
silicon wafers by combining the LS method with SA, whereas the pristine
samples (C-dots and GO) were deposited onto silicon wafers from aqueous
dispersions by drop casting. XRD patterns of hybrid multilayers were
collected on a D8 Avance Bruker diffractometer by using Cu Kα
radiation (40 kV, 40 mA) and a secondary-beam graphite monochromator.
The patterns were recorded in the 2θ range of 2–80°,
in steps of 0.02°, and a counting time of 2 s per step. UV–vis
spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2401PC two-beam spectrophotometer
in the range of 200–800 nm, at a step of 0.5 nm, using the
combination of deuterium and halogen lamps as the light source. The
photoluminescence spectra were recorded on a Jobin Yvon Fluorolog
3 spectrofluorometer FL-11 employing a 450 W xenon lamp and a P928P
photodetector. The slits were set to 5 nm. The photoluminescence spectra
were corrected through the instrument-supplied files created from
compounds with known quantum yields and specific for the Si photodetector.
All optical UV–vis and PL spectra were recorded at room temperature
either from hybrid thin films deposited on quartz substrates or using
10 mm path-length quartz cuvettes in the case of C-dot aqueous dispersions.
For the photoluminescence spectra, the detector–source geometry
was at 90° with respect to the sample, and for the photoluminescence
measurements of the film, the quartz substrate was set in a reflective
geometry. Infrared spectra covering the spectral range 400–4000
cm–1 were recorded on a Shimadzu FT-IR 8400 infrared
spectrometer equipped with a deuterated triglycine sulfate detector.
Each spectrum was the average of 128 scans collected at 2 cm–1 resolution. The C-dot samples were in the form of KBr pellets containing
ca. 2 wt % of the materials.
