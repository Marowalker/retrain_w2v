Redox
species such as transition metals may, unknowingly, integrate
carbon materials that are produced (or supplied) for the assembling
of electrodes in batteries, supercapacitors, and fuel cells. The extent
to which these species alter the electrochemical profile of carbons
and affect the performance and/or degradation of energy storage systems
is still not fully appreciated. Alkaline oxidation (or fusion) is
a promising approach to disintegrate nanocarbons for the subsequent
study of their chemical composition by routine analytical tools. In
this work, three commercial carbon powders, relevant for electrochemical
applications and bearing varied textural orientation (point, radial,
and planar), were selected to evaluate the versatility of fusion as
a pretreatment process for elemental analysis. Additionally, the interaction
of the flux, a lithium borate salt, with the carbons was elucidated
by examining their post-fusion residues. The degree of structural
degradation varied and, generally, the doping with Li and/or B (whether
substitutional or interstitial) was low to nonexistent. With future
developments, fusion could become a relevant pretreatment method to
analyze the composition of carbon materials, even when complex mixtures
(e.g., cycled battery electrodes) and larger batch scales are considered.

1 Introduction
The
textural and structural versatilities of carbon materials explain
their diverse properties which range from the gas impermeability of
glass-like carbon1 to the outstanding charge
carrier mobility measured in graphene.2 For quite some time, one of the main areas of interest of the carbon
research community has been energy storage and conversion systems,
namely, the application of these materials as electrodes and current
conductors. It is notable that three decades after the lithium-ion
batteries were first commercialized, processed graphite flakes remain
the preferred choice of anode material. Perhaps more surprising is
the fact that there is no way to reliably (and routinely) measure
the concentration of chemical elements in carbon-based battery electrodes.3

Concerning the elemental analysis of refractory
materials such
as graphite, there is a limited number of methodologies that one can
resort to when sampling at batch scale. In particular, when considering
carbon materials, the utilization of analytical tools and metrology
protocols by Industry and Academia is, generally, nonstandardized.
This could explain many of the uncertainties that populate the nanocarbons’
market and research fields such as commonly reported variations for
the nexus structure–composition properties. In a recent report,
an example of an uncertainty source was described: two different lots
of single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) powder were purchased which,
after assessment with neutron activation analysis (NAA) and ion beam
analysis (IBA), were seen to present large and undisclosed variations
in their chemical composition.4 Overall,
without tools and protocols that are both cost-effective and comply
with regulatory legislation, it will be challenging to maintain a
chain of trust that includes all stakeholders of the nanocarbon field.

Plasma-based analytical methods such as inductively coupled plasma
optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) are an interesting option
for the routine study of chemical composition of (nano)carbons. However,
these materials can be difficult to disaggregate, a critical step
to leach elements from the carbonaceous matrix and prepare solutions
for ICP-OES analysis.5 To present, ashing
and acid digestion are the most popular sample preparation approaches.6 In 2016, we observed that alkaline oxidation
(a.k.a. fusion) is also capable to digest different types of carbons.7 The ICP-OES readings from the fusion procedure
were compared with those of microwave-assisted acid digestion, but
the outcome was not entirely conclusive. In a follow-up study, we
validated fusion for ICP-OES by resorting to a chemically certified
reference material (CRM), the SWCNT-1, and a lithium (meta)borate
salt.8 Additionally, it was shown that
the disintegration of the carbonaceous matrix occurred without the
formation of compounds such as carbides or the integration of B (by
substitution) or Li (by intercalation) in the structure of the nanotubes.

To extend on the above, the next logical step is to apply and validate
the fusion approach for other carbon materials. In particular, testing
of commercial samples that may present batch-to-batch differences
in texture, morphology, and chemical composition could be of relevance
to teams that integrate these in energy storage systems. In this work,
three types of carbons (carbon black, carbon nanotubes, and expandable
graphite) were subjected to alkaline oxidation and their chemical
composition studied with ICP-OES. Given the nonexistence of matrix-matched
CRMs, the validation of concentration values was done with reference
to previously obtained readings from NAA, a primary analytical method.9 When sample residues were obtained, these were
structurally and spectroscopically evaluated to shed light on the
disintegration path of the carbon materials.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Electrochemical Analysis
Generally,
research teams investigating intercalation-type batteries assemble
their electrochemical cells trusting that the carbon materials they
procure are homogeneous and pure. However, this may not always be
the case.4,10 To identify electrochemically active substances
that are not intrinsic to carbon allotropes, one expeditious tool
is cyclic voltammetry (CV). For the three carbonaceous powders studied
here, the CV survey revealed that they all presented redox peak pairs
(Figure 1). The carbon
black (CB) (Figure 1a) showed a mostly capacitive behavior with one pair of broad peaks
at 0.3–0.4 V [vs standard calomel electrode (SCE)]. This is
typical of a redox reaction of oxygen-containing functional groups11 grafted to the carbon lattice. A similar behavior
was observed for the expandable graphite (Figure 1b). While a lower capacitive current was
identified, the 0.3–0.4 V peaks were more resolved. This could
be due to the presence of an increased number of grafted moieties
and/or additional electrochemically active species. Interestingly,
the CV of the nanotubes (Figure 1c) presented much larger current values and three distinct
redox pairs, in the interval 0.2–0.5 V (vs SCE). Besides the
oxygen-containing moieties, several electrochemically active species
could be present (such as the molybdenum used to grow nanotubes).12−14 Overall, the disparity in the number of redox pairs and the capacitive
current readings is notable, despite all samples being commercialized
as carbon materials. While it is not the aim of the present work to
study the mechanisms through which foreign elements may affect the
performance of electrode materials (capacity, durability, etc.), analogous
studies for the electrocatalysis field provided conclusive evidence
of the critical impact that metallic impurities have.15−20 Still, as the redox pairs result from the presence of noncarbon
elements, understanding the chemical composition of these powders
is critical to explain their electrochemical response.

graphite, and (c) SWCNTs, showing the presence of reversible redox
pairs; these peaks are extrinsic to carbon materials.

2.2 Elemental Analysis
In the majority
of cases, commercial carbons are sold through a distributor. To validate
the product’s quality, the manufacturer provides a technical
specifications sheet. Unfortunately, given the lack of standardized
protocols and independent quality seals, the information provided
on chemical composition of carbon powders may not be entirely reliable.
Previously, we used NAA and IBA to characterize the composition of
the materials investigated here.4 Given
its status of primary metrological tool, the elemental concentrations
measured with NAA were considered as benchmark values for the present
ICP-OES study. To prepare the three carbon powders, an alkaline oxidation
procedure (recently validated for a certified nanocarbon sample)8 was used. The ICP-OES results of eight selected
elements are summarized in Table 1 (note that the concentrations derive from the average
of three different samples for each carbon powder).

In respect to the CB, when the melt was poured into the beaker
(half-filled with 10% HNO3), it did not yield a homogeneous
transparent solution. Instead, a suspension resulted where black particles
were notoriously visible. Using centrifugation and filtration, the
residues were separated from the liquid, which was then taken to the
ICP-OES. Most of the elements listed in Table 1 could not be identified, either because
of their absence or because they were present in quantities below
the limit of detection (LOD) of the optical spectrometer (see Experimental Section). The lack of, for instance,
transition metals was expected as the CB should be (almost) free of
these (as per the vendor technical sheet, it is produced from the
thermal decomposition of acetylene). The exception was calcium but,
when compared to the benchmark concentration,4 it was possible to recover only 53% of it. One plausible explanation
concerns the lack of chemical homogeneity of CB, as one of the three
samples gave Ca levels below the LOD.

Differently, pouring the
melt containing expandable graphite into
the beaker resulted in a clear solution with very few suspended particles.
Attending to the benchmark values, the recoveries obtained for Ca,
Cr, K, and Mn were quite satisfactory. On the other hand, the concentration
of Fe measured with ICP-OES was well below the expected figure (Table 1). It is pertinent
to note that, with NAA, it was not possible to achieve similar mass
fractions on the duplicates for this element.4 Again, this could be justified by the nonhomogeneity of the powder.
Still, and while merely indicative, there is a coincidence of the
ICP-OES Fe reading (107 mg/L) with that of IBA in ref (4) (109 mg/L).

As concerns
the sample of carbon nanotubes, the highest concentrations
were measured for Co, Mo, As, and Cr (Table 1). The first two elements acted as catalysts
during the synthesis process of the nanotubes.21 With the exception of As, all recoveries were satisfactory.
A possible reason for the low recovery of this element is its relatively
low boiling point (613 °C). Considering that the fusion reaction
temperature was more than 1000 °C (in an open vessel), it is
not surprising that significant mass losses of As occurred.

2.3 Structural Analysis
The generation
of byproducts is a possibility that is commonly referred to in the
literature of alkaline oxidation. In the case of carbon, possible
inorganics that could be formed include intercalation compounds, carbides,
or substitutionally doped graphene layers. In view of this, the structural
characterization of the as-received powders and their fusion residues
(if available) was carried out with electron microscopy and solid-state
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).

Scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) are powerful tools
to analyze the morphology and microstructure of carbon materials.
Furthermore, they can be complemented with energy-dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy (EDXS) to pinpoint the presence of different elements
in particles. In Figure 2, a tableau is presented that contains low- and medium-magnification
TEM images of the flux and carbon powders, before and after the fusion
process.

Figure 2 Low- and medium-magnification TEM micrographs of the flux and carbons
in the as-received and post-fusion states, (a–d) lithium borate
(LiBO2), (e–h) acetylene CB, (i–l) EG, and
(m–p) SWCNTs.

The first set of panels
(Figure 2a,d) refers
to the lithium flux. From the TEM micrographs,
the as-received salt appeared agglomerated and with an undefined structure.
Given its dielectric nature, charging was observed, preventing a more
detailed study at higher resolution. In this case, the SEM images
were more informative as they showed the spheroidal morphology of
the microscaled particles (with several hundreds of micrometers in
diameter) and their rough surface (Figure S1a,b). After the (blank) fusion process, the TEM micrographs revealed
fragments with a more defined shape, but no microstructural information
could be extracted. Still, from the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD)
patterns, changes to the overall atomic arrangement of the material
took place as it became more crystalline after resolidification (Figure S2). The post-fusion SEM images of the
lithium salt were not informative (not shown). The EDXS analysis,
before and after melting (Figure S3a,b,
respectively), did not identify other elements besides B and O (note
that the Li is too light to be detected with this technique).

The as-received CB showed the primary and secondary structures
typical of these materials (Figure 2e,f). Larger agglomerates were seen in the SEM images
(Figure S4a,b). The EDXS spectrum contained
only Cu (from the grid) and C (Figure S5a). Upon the fusion process, identifying the presence of blacks (or
residues of these) was not straightforward (Figure S5b). For the most part, the TEM grids showed the presence
of irregularly shaped particles that are most likely derived from
the lithium salt (Figure 2g,h). Possibly, and despite the pronounced suspension seen
in the melt-receiving beaker, the aggregating secondary structure
was lost, which made imaging of the isolated blacks challenging.

In the case of expandable graphite, the as-received powder contained
faceted flakes with a fair degree of graphitic arrangement (Figure 2i,j). The dimensions
of the flakes were clarified with SEM (Figure S6), with an average size of 500 μm measured. The elements
identified initially by EDXS were C, O, Na, S, Ca, Cr, and Fe (Figure S7a). After the fusion, few particles
were collected from the melt-receiving beaker. Still, these showed
an interesting level of resilience, as demonstrated by the images
in Figure 2k,l. While
the flake facets were lost (i.e., its planar texture at the microscale
and above), the carbon was not entirely disintegrated and reorganized
into smaller graphitic crystallites (nanotexture) with random orientation.
From the EDXS analysis (Figure S7b), the
presence of some of the intercalants was identified (e.g., S).

Besides bundles of well-structured nanotubes (observed both with
TEM and SEM, Figure S8), the as-received
sample of SWCNTs contained nanoparticles and amorphous carbon (Figure 2m,n). In general,
the particles were enclosed by graphitic shells and consisted of catalyst
remainders (Co and Mo), as identified with EDXS (Figure S9). Post-fusion, there were barely any suspended residues
in the melt-receiving beaker, but, after evaporation, a small quantity
was collected. The TEM assessment (Figure 2o,p) did not identify nanotubes. Instead,
lumps of disordered carbon dominated the residues.

While the
microscopical analysis provided insight into the structural
organization of the carbon powders, pre- and post-fusion, questions
remained regarding the extent of the flux interaction with the samples.
In respect to this, solid-state NMR can be a powerful aid as it allows
the study of the chemical environments experienced by a range of elements
such as Li and B. These two nuclei, along with C, were probed with
one-dimensional (1D) magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR and two-dimensional
(2D) multiple-quantum (MQ)-MAS NMR. The aim was to identify both structural
and chemical changes resulting from the exposure of the carbon materials
to the lithium borate melt.

First, the effect of melting and
resolidification on the (blank)
lithium flux structure was studied. In particular, the B–O
network was examined using the 11B quadrupolar nuclei (Figure 3). The single-pulse 11B MAS NMR spectrum of the as-received flux revealed two groups
of resonances, centered at 5 and 20 ppm (Figure 3a). The first can be assigned to the tetrahedral
BO4 sites because the second-order quadrupolar broadening
is small and the peak is clearly resolved. The broader downfield resonance,
at 20 ppm, follows a pattern that can be assigned to the triangular
BO3 species. As for the corresponding 11B MQMAS
(Figure 3b, blue),
it shows that the BO4 resonance has a single symmetric
site.22,23 By contrast, the as-received salt contains
BO3 units exposed to different chemical environments. The
range of peaks (marked with blue arrows) is due to the symmetric,
or trigonal, sites (i.e., containing three bridging or nonbridging
oxygen atoms) and the asymmetric sites (i.e., with one or two bridging
oxygen atoms). Post-fusion, the changes occurring to the B–O
network are evident from both the 1D and 2D spectra. The 11B MAS NMR (Figure 3a) shows an overall upfield shift for the two peaks. In addition,
the BO4/BO3 intensity ratio decreases and the
BO3 resonance splits into two well-separated components
(at 17 and 23 ppm). In order to show the number of distinct boron
sites present in the fused system, 11B MQMAS was employed
(Figure 3b, red). For
the BO3 sites, the most remarkable variation is in the
isotropic distribution, though a slight shift is also present in the
anisotropic axis. These are due to the rearrangement of boron coordination
and the existence of multiple BO3 sites. The sensitivity
of this interaction to the dispersion of the B–O–B bond
angle is known.24 Taken together, the BO3 asymmetric fraction increased and became more abundant than
its symmetric counterpart. As regards the BO4 sites, it
is interesting that the 11B MQMAS points to an increased
structural ordering as the corresponding peak loses its lobes, thus
becoming comparatively sharper. A higher degree of crystallinity in
this salt is corroborated by the XRD powder diffractograms mentioned
above (Figure S2) and previous literature
reports.25

Figure 3 11B solid-state NMR for the
lithium flux in as-received
(blue) and fused (red) states: (a) 1D MAS spectra and (b) 2D MQMAS,
where the traced lines are guides to the eye marking the shift differences
that occurred between the as-received and fused salt in the B–O
arrangements.

Besides the B–O network,
the study of the chemical environment
of Li is also informative. The 7Li MAS for the blank flux,
pre- and post-fusion, shows a single broad peak that results from
the existence of different lithium sites (Figure S10).26−28 After the heat treatment, a small upfield shift of
this peak was detected. As for the complementary 7Li MQMAS
(Figure S11a), it shows different line
widths: the sharpness of the post-fusion peak (red) contrasts with
the broader fingerprint of the as-received salt (blue). This is in
agreement with the 11B and XRD observations. Upon melting,
it is possible that the salt oxidized further as it reacted with atmospheric
oxygen (for instance, via the production of Br2 from the
1.5 wt % LiBr). Subsequently, there would be a higher density of BO4 units. These would stabilize the structure and create electronically
denser sites where the Li+ could be accommodated. In these
circumstances, the highly mobile lithium, while experiencing faster
exchange rates, would be hoping through well-defined lattice sites.
This would then account for the narrower MQMAS shape.

Following
the analysis of the flux (blank), its interaction with
the three carbon powders was investigated by 13C, 11B, and 7Li NMR. In Figure 4, the 13C MAS NMR spectra for
the as-received and fused carbons are shown. The CB exhibited, initially,
a broad signal at ca. 100 ppm (Figure 4a, bottom spectrum). After being in contact with the
melt of the lithium salt, a slight downfield shift was observed and
attributed to bonding with electronegative elements, most likely oxygen
(Figure 4a, top spectrum).29 A similar behavior was observed for the expandable
graphite (Figure 4b).
Here, obtaining a clear signal was challenging because of the presence
of paramagnetic iron (Table 1) and the relaxation effect, a phenomenon that was observed
in previous studies.30 In the case of the
as-received carbon nanotubes (Figure 4c), the spectrum contained an asymmetric peak which
could be deconvoluted into two signals (at 119 and 125 ppm). These
were assigned to the sp2-hybridized carbon atoms present
in metallic and semiconducting tubes.31−33 With the fusion process,
the intensity of the entire asymmetric peak was considerably decreased
and another broad peak appeared, at 37 ppm. According to the literature,
this chemical shift is typical of sp3-hybridized carbon
atoms.34,35 Here, its presence is explained by the oxidation
process that disintegrates and burns the nanotubes, with the residues
being small fragments of disordered carbon material, as confirmed
with TEM.

Figure 4 13C solid-state MAS NMR for (a) CB, (b) EG, and (c)
SWCNTs, in the as-received (bottom spectra) and fused states (top
spectra).

The 11B analysis was
more detailed with both MAS and
MQMAS spectra acquired for the three post-fusion carbon samples (Figures 5 and S12). The 11B MAS NMR of the fused
CB and expandable graphite showed a response resembling that of the
blank flux (Figure 5a). The two resonances, at 5 and 17 ppm, were assigned to the symmetrical
tetrahedral BO4 coordination and to the triangular BO3 coordination species, respectively. While the chemical shifts
in these samples are constant, the intensity ratio of the two lines
varies. The consistent intensity reduction from the blank to the carbons
indicates that the tetrahedra are replaced by triangular units. This
is more pronounced in the expandable graphite. Given the extended
disintegration observed for this sample (when comparing the density
of suspended particles in the melt-receiving beakers), one explanation
is that the combustion of the carbons was partially assisted by the
loss of an oxygen atom from the BO4 units. In addition,
a very weak peak appeared at 28 ppm. Slightly more intense in the
fused expandable graphite, this was assigned to the chemical environment
of B–C bonds with trigonal planar symmetry.28 The 11B MQMAS spectra of these two fused carbons
showed similar profiles to that of the resolidified flux. The main
difference was a broader peak distribution on the symmetric BO3 sites for the carbons, with this band extending downfield
to about 20 ppm (regions marked with squares in the insets of Figure S12). Concerning the nanotubes, these
showed a completely different response from the other carbon samples.
The 11B MAS spectra of the fused SWCNT (Figure 5a) shows the same two peaks
(for the BO4 and BO3 units), but the chemical
shifts, intensity ratio, and line widths are surprisingly similar
to those of the as-received flux (blank). As for the 11B MQMAS, the two peaks undergo broadening. At 17 ppm, there is a
noticeable downfield shift (on both the isotropic and anisotropic
components), but a small amount of boron remains in the same position,
as indicated by the red arrows in Figure 5b. At 5 ppm, the (relative) intensity of
the peak is significantly increased. The similarity in the 1D and
2D spectral profiles indicates that the chemical environment for the
BO3 units is more represented by the symmetric than the
asymmetric coordination. Also, the BO4 lobes are indicative
of a less ordered array of these units. Put together, the presence
of the sp3-type fragments and, possibly, the transition
metals Co and Mo could have impaired the restructuring of the flux
that was seen for the blank and the other two carbon samples. In this
regard, the reorganization favored the trigonal BO3 unit
dispersion while preventing the BO4 units to generate lattice
sites for the lithium.

Figure 5 11B solid-state NMR for the lithium flux and
carbon
samples after the fusion procedure: (a) 1D MAS spectra, where the
traced lines signal the intensity maxima of the different peaks identified,
(b) 2D MQMAS of the flux (red) and the SWCNT (purple), both fused,
and where the arrows highlight the changes in the distribution of
the BO3-related peaks.

To finalize the study for the carbon samples, high-resolution 7Li MAS and MQMAS spectra were acquired. For the CB and the
expandable graphite, the results were similar (Figure S11b,c). In both cases, a broad peak resulted, which
means that the lithium had very slow motion. This can be explained
by some sort of interaction with the carbon atoms, possibly via intercalation
of the alkali metal. In addition, a new upfield peak appears in both
cases (indicated by arrows), which was attributed to the presence
of the Li+ species in the vicinity of the carbon surface.
For the carbon nanotubes (Figure S11d),
the 7Li MQMAS showed an even broader peak. The lithium
had slower motion, possibly raising the prospect of interstitial trapping
in a disordered network of carbons. One additional peak was found
downfield (marked with an arrow), which could refer to trapping of
lithium in an ordered pore such as the interior of a surviving tubular
section or in the interstice of a bundle of sectioned SWCNTs.

2.4 Discussion
In the above, several
types of carbon materials were subjected to alkaline oxidation in
order to chemically analyze them with ICP-OES. Using the same experimental
parameters, the degree of disintegration of the carbon matrix differed,
with the SWCNTs being the sample that was best digested. Several factors
could explain this, such as the differences in textural orientation
(point, radial, and planar), the number of stacked graphene layers
(for the EG and SWCNT), or the presence of oxidation accelerators
such as metallic impurities (e.g., Co and Mo originating from the
production of SWCNT). In the specific case of CB, it was noticed that
its powder was less dense (“fluffier”), which made the
prefusion homogenization with the lithium flux more challenging. Moreover,
it is not clear if wetting by the molten salt is as efficient as for
the other two materials. Accordingly, and while the elemental analysis
of the CB was unreliable, the measurements performed on the expandable
graphite and the nanotubes were satisfactory: clear, transparent solutions
were obtained, which enabled recoveries well above 80% for various
elements. Here, it is interesting to highlight the values for Co and
Mo in the nanotube sample, at 86 and 93%, respectively. These yields
are higher than the analogous for a certified SWCNT, also reported
by us.8 Given that the matrix was similar,
it appears that employing a beaker filled with an acid solution (to
directly collect and dissolve the melt) represents a more reliable
approach than pouring the fused salt onto a mold and subsequently
crush/dissolve the resulting glass-like bead.

Following the
structural analysis, it was observed that the type and extent of the
lithium borate interaction with a carbon powder can vary. First, despite
the post-fusion broadening of the main 13C MAS-NMR resonance
(common to all), different displacements took place. For the CB and
the expandable graphite, the peak moved upfield, probably because
of the proximity of electronegative elements. In the case of nanotubes,
the main peak shifted downfield, implying their widespread destruction
and dominant presence of sp3 carbon species. This result
is in good agreement with our previous study.8 Second, from the 11B MQMAS data, the CB and expandable
graphite had responses that were similar to that of the fused flux,
the exception being a barely noticeable peak at 28 ppm. Hence, the
direct interaction of the B with the C species was minimal, but the
formation of some residual B–C bonds is a possibility, in particular
for the expandable graphite. By contrast, the SWCNT showed a similar
behavior to the as-received flux, with spectral changes referring
mainly to the BO4 symmetry. Finally, the 7Li
MQMAS analysis suggests the slight occurrence of interstitial trapping
of Li+ in the residues of the SWCNT, while in the CB and
graphite residues, the interaction is mostly surface-based or related
to basal plane intercalation. Note that the identification of interstitial
lithium is in contrast to our previous work.8 Several factors could explain this inconsistency: (1) the lithium
salt and the SWCNT sample used were different and (2) the 7Li SS-NMR study included a 2D spectral analysis which is, generally,
more sensitive to identify multinuclei interactions.

3 Conclusions
Identifying and quantifying the presence
of foreign elements in
carbon electrode materials are important steps to understand how they
may affect the performance and stability of energy storage systems
such as batteries. Three commercial carbons—with point, radial,
and planar textural orientation—were surveyed with CV, confirming
the presence of redox species in the as-received powders. Upon subjecting
these to a process of alkaline oxidation (or fusion), it was possible
to measure the concentration of several transition metal elements
with ICP-OES. Further to this, particulate residues were collected
for structural analysis with electron microscopy and NMR.

Although
the fusion pretreatment process was unsuccessful for the
CB, it did result in clear liquids (to the naked eyes) for the expandable
graphite and nanotubes. The elemental levels for these two materials,
measured with ICP-OES, were very close to the benchmark concentrations
obtained with NAA. Post-fusion, the residues of the expandable graphite
kept part of the graphitic structure, while in the case of nanotubes,
the carbon lattice became predominantly disordered. In line with the
microscopical observations, the multinuclei NMR structural study identified
several types of minor interactions between carbon and lithium, with
interstitial trapping likely taking place in the residues of the nanotubes.

Overall, alkaline oxidation is a simple and low-cost sample pretreatment
approach for ICP-OES, applicable to structurally different carbon
materials.

the SWCNTs (Lot MKBW7867, CAS 308068-56-6, Sigma-Aldrich), and expandable
graphite (grade 3772, Lot 881201B-3, Asbury Carbons) were procured
and used as-received. For the flux, a lithium salt containing 98.5
wt % of lithium metaborate, LiBO2 (CAS 13453-69-5), and
1.5 wt % LiBr (CAS 7550-35-8) was purchased from Malvern PANalytical.
Pt/Au crucibles (95/5 wt %, Malvern PANalytical) were employed as
reaction vessels during the fusion procedure. To dissolve the glass-like
beads resulting from the fusion, a 10% nitric acid (HNO3) solution was prepared from 70% HNO3 (Aristar Plus, Lot
1118092, CAS-7697-37-2, BDH, Canada) using deionized water (resistivity
= 18 MΩ·cm, produced with a Milli-Q system from Millipore,
UK). Standard stock solutions of single elements (PerkinElmer and
Inorganic Ventures, US) were used to calibrate the ICP-OES instrument,
namely, 2% (v/v) solutions of Ca (CAS 7440-70-2, Lot 16-94 Ca), K
(CAS 7440-09-7, Lot 16-26 K), Co (CAS 7440-48-4, Lot 16-76 Co), Mn
(CAS 7439-96-5, Lot 15-91 Mn), As (CAS 7440-38-2, Lot 15-64 As), Cr
(CAS 7440-47-3, Lot 15-65 Cr), and Fe (CAS 7439-89-6, Lot 15-185 Fe)
and a Mo standard derived from Inorganic Ventures, with a matrix of
H20/tr NH4OH (Lot D2-MO02036, CAS 7732-18-5
for water, CAS 1636-21-6 for ammonium hydroxide, and CAS 13106-76-8
for ammonium molybdate).

4.2 Electrochemical and Structural
Analyses
4.2.1 Cyclic Voltammetry
Electrodes were
prepared according to a procedure reported elsewhere.11 In short, 5 mg of the carbonaceous material was mixed with
15 μL of Nafion (5 wt % in water and isopropanol), 500 μL
of deionized water, and 500 μL of isopropanol, to obtain a mixture
which was then ultrasonicated for 30 min. This slurry was drop-cast
onto a glassy carbon electrode (3 mm in diameter) and dried under
an incandescent bulb lamp for 15 min, in atmospheric conditions. All
electrochemical experiments were carried out on a Bio-Logic VMP3 electrochemical
workstation, using 1 M H2SO4 as the electrolyte,
a Pt wire as the counter electrode, and a SCE as the reference electrode.
Cyclic voltammograms were obtained at scan rates of 50 mV s–1 in the 0–1 V (vs SCE) range and at room temperature.

4.2.2 Transmission Electron Microscopy
Microstructural imaging
and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDXS) were performed at 300 kV using a Thermo Fisher Scientific Titan
SuperTWIN microscope incorporating an EDAX octane
silicon drift detector. Samples were prepared by suspending a few
milligrams of the powder materials in ethanol and then drop-cast these
onto Holey-carbon Cu grids. For the glass-like beads (blank or sample),
an agate pestle and mortar was used to crush and grind these to a
powder.

4.2.3 Magic Angle Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
All samples were grinded with an agate pestle and mortar. For the
1D 13C MAS NMR, a known amount of powder material was filled
into zirconia rotors and the spectra recorded on a Bruker AVANCE III
spectrometer, operating at a resonance frequency of 100 MHz and using
a conventional double resonance 4 mm MAS probe. The spinning frequency
was set to 10–15 kHz. NMR chemical shifts are reported with
respect to tetramethylsilane, which acted as the external reference.
Spectra were recorded via a spin echo pulse sequence (pulse length
of 3.4 μs) with four-phase alternation, synchronized with the
spinning rate for the MAS experiments (to delete all background signals
from the probe). The interscan delay was set to 15 s to allow complete
relaxation. 5000 to 30 000 scans were performed. An apodization
function (exponential), corresponding to a line broadening of 80 Hz,
was applied prior to the Fourier transformation. For the 1D 11B (I = 3/2) MAS NMR, the experiments were recorded
on a 21.1 T Bruker AVANCE III spectrometer (vL(11B) = 288.826 MHz) with a double-resonance 3.2
mm MAS probe and a spinning frequency of 20 kHz with short pulse (π/12
with a pulse width of 1 μs and repetition time of 2 s). For
the 11B multiple-quantum (MQ)MAS experiments, a three-pulse
MQMAS sequence with a z-filter and a spinning frequency
of 20 kHz was used. The excitation and conversion pulse lengths were
5.7 and 1.9 μs, respectively, and the read pulse length was
20 μs. The t1 increment was 50 μs
to ensure rotor-synchronized data acquisition. Chemical shifts are
referenced to an external sample of 1 M boric acid. For the 1D 7Li MAS NMR, experiments were carried out on a 21.1 T Bruker
AVANCE III spectrometer (vL(11B) = 288.826 MHz) with a double resonance 3.2 mm MAS probe and a
spinning frequency of 20 kHz. A single-pulse sequence with phase cycling
was employed. Sixty-four scans were performed with a 3 s pulse duration
and a 1 s repetition time. The external reference (0 ppm) was LiCl
powder. For the 7Li MQMAS, the experiments were carried
out using a three-pulse MQMAS sequence with a z-filter
and a spinning frequency of 20 kHz. The excitation and conversion
pulse lengths were 3.6 and 1.3 μs, respectively, and the read
pulse length was 20 μs.

4.3 Alkaline
Oxidation
The Pt crucibles
were thoroughly washed with a diluted acid solution for 1 h and then
cleaned with 70% (v/v) ethanol. The fusion blank (control) was prepared
by weighing 250 mg of the flux. The fusion sample was prepared by
adding 25 mg of the carbonaceous material to 250 mg of the flux (1:10
ratio) and carefully mixing these, inside the Pt crucible, with the
assistance of a vortex. The vessel was then taken to the furnace (Claisse
LeNeo, Malvern PANalytical) where the melting process started at 1050 °C
and lasted for 6 min. For the structural analysis, the glass-like
samples were carefully broken with a manual press followed by grinding
with an agate pestle and mortar until a powder was obtained. For TEM,
around 1 mg of sample was dissolved in 10 mL of ethanol. For the ICP-OES
analysis, the crucible was tilted and the melt dropped into a polypropylene
beaker filled with a 10% HNO3 solution. Stirring took place
for 4 min, that is, until the total dissolution of the melt.

4.4 Elemental Analysis
For the ICP-OES
measurements, an Agilent 5110, bearing a synchronous vertical dual-view
configuration and a wavelength window between 167 and 785 nm, was
employed. The instrumental parameters used are listed in Table 2. To calibrate the
equipment, single-element solutions of As, Co, Cr, Mn, Mo, Ca, Fe,
and K, at concentrations of 0.5, 5, and 50 ppm, were used. All were
derived from the respective 1000 ppm single-element standards. In
order to check the instrument performance and ensure that its precision
was not degrading over the period of the analysis, a quality control
sample (1 ppm) and solutions for continuing calibration verification
(5 ppm) were prepared.
