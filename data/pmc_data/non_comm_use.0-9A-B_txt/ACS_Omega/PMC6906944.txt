A 59 m-thick section of a freshwater oil shale interbedded
with
marlstone of Lower Carboniferous (Tournaisian) age from the Big Marsh
area in Antigonish Basin, Nova Scotia, Canada, was examined using
reflected light microscopy, Rock-Eval pyrolysis, X-ray diffractometry
analysis, inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry for elemental
analysis, and prompt γ for boron concentration. The oil shale
was deposited in a lacustrine environment based on geology, sedimentology,
variation in organic matter, and boron content (28–54 ppm).
Organic petrology classified the oil shale into three broadly distinct
types. Type A oil shale is a coastal facies shale containing terrestrially
derived macerals, such as vitrinite and inertinite, sporinite, with
some lamalginite, and amorphous bituminous matrix. Type B oil shale
was deposited in a shallow-water facies and contains mostly lamalginite
and some vitrinite and sporinite. Type C oil shale is a relatively
deep-water facies, associated with open-water Torbanite-type oil shale
and contains mostly Botryococcus colonial telalginite. The oil shale
is thermally mature (Tmax is 441–443
°C). Total organic carbon (TOC) varies from 5.8 to 7.3 wt %,
and the hydrogen index is between 507 and 557 mg HC/g TOC. The rate
of sedimentation as determined by the Th/U ratio indicates possibility
of three sedimentation periods: an irregular but mostly slow rate
of sedimentation from the base of the section up to 68 m, followed
by a regular and slow rate between 68 and 53 m, and a regular and
fast rate between 53 m and the top of the section. The higher Th/U
ratio during deposition of the shallow-water facies was due to the
input of allochthonous U. The redox conditions, as reflected in the
variation of Cr to Mo, U, and Ni + V, indicate that the oil shale
was deposited under suboxic–dysoxic conditions. The high organic
productivity by phytoplankton and bacteria is characterized by a low
Cr and high V/Cr ratio and suboxic conditions. In contrast, the well-oxygenated
and uniform, warm-temperature upper water level supports a dysoxic
environment. Variation of Sr/Ca vs Mn/Ca ratios indicates that most
samples have low values, a characteristic of colder water and high
terrigenous influx. The post-Archean Australian shale (PAAS)-normalized
rare earth elements (REEs) follow three trends. Type A oil shale has
the highest concentration of total REEs (648 ppm) and light REEs (LREEs,
605 ppm) as compared with type C (269 and 233 ppm), which are less
than half of type A. Type B oil shale has the lowest total REEs (184
ppm) and LREEs (152 ppm). The concentration of heavy REEs decreased
from 43 ppm in type A oil shale to 36 ppm in type C oil shale. Comparison
of PAAS-normalized REEs for the three oil shale types indicates a
reduction of the negative Eu anomaly with depth, which is possibly
related to sedimentary sorting as a result of accumulation of fine
sediments in the deeper water zone of the lake. The concentration
of most elements of environmental concern is similar to and/or lower
than the world shale. However, there are instances of higher concentrations
of hazardous elements (e.g., As, Cd, Mo, and Se).

==== Body
1 Introduction
Oil shales are important
sedimentary rocks because they are the
immature precursors of hydrocarbon source rocks and are capable of
producing liquid hydrocarbons under suitable geological conditions.
Oil shale is generally a fine-grained rock containing hydrogen-rich
organic matter, from which hydrocarbons can be extracted by thermal
treatment processes.1 Oil shales are deposited
mainly under anoxic conditions, where high algal input due to prolific
planktonic growth in surface waters results in an abundance of sapropelic
organic matter, which becomes preserved under anaerobic conditions.

Oil shale is divided broadly into continental and marine types
based on kerogen composition and occurrence of organic and inorganic
fossils.2,3 Continental oil shales are deposited under
lacustrine and lagoonal conditions, in environments similar to coal
but under more aquatic conditions. In fact, cannel coal and boghead
coal are deposited under similar geological conditions to those of
oil shale3−5 but contain terrestrial liptinite (cutinite-sporinite)
and lacustrine telalginite (Botryococcus), respectively.

Canada
hosts numerous oil shale deposits, which are found in most
provinces and territories (Figure 1a). Oil shales in Nova Scotia, eastern Canada, were
first discovered in 1868.1 Nova Scotia
has nine confirmed oil shale deposits, all of which occur in Upper
Paleozoic-age strata that fill the Maritimes Basin (Figure 1a). The Late Carboniferous–Devonian
Maritimes Basin formed as a major depocenter during the Acadian Orogeny.6 This large basin comprises various smaller, northeast-trending,
intermontane basins. Two of the largest oil shale deposits are found
in the Stellarton Formation (Stellarton Basin, in Pictou coalfield)
and in the Rights River Formation (also known as the South Lake Creek
Formation) in the Antigonish Basin (Figure 1b). The present study focuses on a freshwater
oil shale deposit, which is located approximately 11 km north of Antigonish.
This deposit (shown by the red circle in Figure 1a) has been the focus of significant exploration
with over 9 cored wells drilled based on surface exposures of the
oil shale near the Big Marsh settlement.

Figure 1 (a) Location of Canadian
oil shale deposits and their depositional
environments. The location of the oil shale deposit in this study
is marked in red (modified from ref (7)). (b) Map showing the locations of Antigonish,
Stellarton, and Maritimes basins as well as major faults associated
with the Stellarton Basin (modified from ref (6)).

This study is part of a research and development
program on Canadian
oil shale deposits to characterize their potential for hydrocarbon
extraction and possible environmental impact during extraction of
hydrocarbon in ex situ (mining/retorting) and in situ (underground)
operation. As part of this large program, the current study focuses
specifically on the organic petrology and elemental composition of
the lacustrine Big Marsh oil shale as related to its variation to
the paleo shoreline and depth. The hydrocarbon potential and variation
of elements of environmental concern will also be discussed in detail.

2 Stratigraphy
The Antigonish Basin contains
some of the earliest sediments deposited
in the Maritimes Basin, which are of alluvial fan, lacustrine, and
coal swamp origin.7−10 The formation of interest in terms of the highest hydrocarbon potential
is the Tournaisian-aged Rights River Formation of the Horton group
(Figure 2a). The Rights
River Formation is a red conglomerate interbedded with mudstones,
sandstones, oil shale, and coal beds. The oil shale deposits occur
in two major areas, the Beaver settlement (average thickness 61.6
m) and the Big Marsh (average thickness 117.5 m). The two lithologies
associated with the oil shale, in order of abundance, are (a) fissile,
carbonaceous shale with abundant fish remains and having a low hydrocarbon
yield; and (b) massive, bituminous shale with a high hydrocarbon yield.
The latter lithology is the equivalent of the Albert Formation, an
economically important formation in the Moncton Basin of New Brunswick.11 The clay-rich oil shale in the Moncton Basin
often passes laterally into carbonaceous mudstone and coal, indicating
the presence of a stable lake shoreline during the deposition of the
oil shale and a balance in water discharge and recharge.12 This indicates that the lake was hydrologically
open and characterized by a low ionic concentration and no deposition
of chemical sediments.

3 Analytical Procedures
3.1 Sampling
The lacustrine oil shale
deposits in the study area have been described from outcrops along
the nearby shoreline.2 In the Big Marsh
#4 well (Figure 2b),
the oil shale succession is 65 m thick2 and comprises gray sandstones overlain by a thick, relatively monotonous
succession of interbedded dark and light-gray mudstones with only
minor interbedded siltstones and concretions. These, in turn, are
sharply overlain by reddish to gray medium-grained sandstones. A total
of 24 samples were collected, approximately one sample every 3 m (10
ft).2 Samples were collected from the center
of the cores to avoid possible contamination with drilling mud fluids.
Of the original 24 samples, 13 were selected to be analyzed further
geochemically [by Rock-Eval pyrolysis/total organic carbon (TOC)],
petrographically (maceral composition), and elementally (major, trace,
and rare earth elements). The 13 samples were collected from the organic-rich
light to dark-gray mudstone intervals. They were selected based on
the following criteria: (a) their characteristics to represent different
depositional facies, and (b) their hydrocarbon yield.

3.2 Optical Microscopy
Organic petrology,
including fluorescence analysis, was carried out on selected polished
whole-rock samples that were prepared according to the ISO 7404-2
(2009) standard.13 Reflectance measurements
followed the ASTM standard D7708-14 (2014)14 and the ISO 7404-5 (2009) standard.15 A reflected light Zeiss Axio Imager A2m microscope system equipped
with fluorescent light sources was used for petrological observation
under standard conditions (filters: excitation 450–490, beam
splitter 510, and barrier 520 nm). Maceral analysis was performed
using the point-counting method (300 points of organic matter were
counted in each sample; mineral matter was excluded) under both white
and UV light. The ICCP (1994) classification of the liptinite group
macerals was followed, as described in ref (16).16

3.3 Rock-Eval Pyrolysis Analysis
A Rock-Eval
6 (Vinci Technologies, France) instrument17 was used on the 13 samples to determine parameters of total organic
carbon (TOC, wt %), Tmax (°C), the
amount of in situ hydrocarbons (S1), and
those generated upon heating to 650 °C (S2) (mg HC/g rock). Simultaneously, the amount of CO and CO2 released during pyrolysis and oxidation was measured to quantify
the portion of oxygen-containing organic matter (S3 and S4 peaks; mg CO2/g rock). Other parameters reported include the hydrogen index
(HI, mg HC/g TOC), the oxygen index (OI, mg CO2/g TOC),
the production index [PI, (S1/S1 + S2)], mineral
carbon (MINC, wt %), and yield (L/t).

3.4 Elemental Analysis
Following the
evaluation of the Rock-Eval pyrolysis/TOC and organic petrologic analyses
data, the 13 oil shale samples were subjected to elemental analysis.
Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was conducted
at Acme Labs in Vancouver, Canada, following digestion of samples
in HNO3, HClO4, HCl, and HF acids. Concentrations
of Al, Ti, Fe, Na, Mg, K, Ca, S, and P were then determined via mass
spectrometry. Accuracy and precision of ICP-MS values were determined
by use of the reference standard OREAS 45e, prepared from a lateritic
soil from Western Australia, as well as duplicate analysis of random
samples. ICP-MS parameters have an accuracy and precision that deviate
by less than 5% from the reference standard values, with the exception
of accuracy values for Ti, which deviate by less than 8%. Duplicate
sample precision values show less than 5% error for most samples.
Rare earth element (REE) distribution patterns were obtained by measuring
their concentration normalized to the post-Archean Australian shale
(PAAS).18

4 Results
4.1 Petrology
Based on organic matter
composition as revealed by point-counting and supported by elemental
composition, the oil shale samples in the oil shale deposit can be
classified broadly into three distinct types, namely, types A, B,
and C. Representative photomicrographs of each type are shown in Figures 3–5.

Figure 3 (a–d) Organic matter in type A oil shale consists
of lamalginite
and terrestrial input, such as vitrinite, inertinite, and sporinite.
Photomicrographs (a) and (c) were taken under reflected white light,
while (b) and (d) were taken under fluorescence light and oil immersion.

Type A oil shale contains large fragments of vitrinite
(part of
type III gas-prone kerogen) and inertinite (part of type IV kerogen)
(Figure 3a–c).
Also present are remnants of lamalginite (part of type II oil-prone
kerogen), which are partially assimilated into the amorphous bituminous
matrix (bituminite) (Figure 3b,d). Type A oil shale was deposited in coastal facies. Type
B oil shale has a matrix of lamalginite and bituminite and contains
sporinite (part of type II kerogen) and inertinite fragments (Figure 4a–c). Type
B oil shale was deposited in shallow-water facies. Type C oil shale
contains abundant Botryococcus (Pila-type) telalginite (part of type
I oil-prone kerogen) that fluoresces with bluish-green to brown colors
depending on the degree of weathering (Figure 5a,b). Type C oil
shale was deposited in deep-water facies (near the center of the lake).
The maceral composition of each individual sample from the three facies
analyzed in this study and the average composition of each facies
are shown in Table 1.

Figure 4 (a–c) Type B oil shale contains sporinite displaying zonation
with bright rims, inertinite fragments, lamalginite, and matrix bituminite
(a), sporinite, and inertinite (b). There is some microlayering of
algae in sections perpendicular to the bedding, indicating underwater
deposition of organic matter. Lamalginite, matrix bituminite, vitrinite,
and inertinite are present (c).

Figure 5 (a, b) Organic matter in type II oil shale consists mostly
of Botryococcus
(Pila-type) telalginite showing serrated margins and various stages
of maturation, as evidenced by the intensity of fluorescent light.
Sporinite grains fluorescing light-brown are also present.

4.2 Rock-Eval Pyrolysis/TOC
The Rock-Eval
pyrolysis and TOC data for each of the 13 samples are shown in Table 2. The average values
of the three facies (coastal, shallow, and deep) are shown at the
bottom of Table 2.
The average TOC content in the three distinct facies ranges from 5.8
to 7.3 wt %. S1 values are less than 1
mg HC/g rock, and the S2 values range
from 32.6 to 40.9 mg HC/g rock. HI values range between 507 and 557
mg HC/g TOC. The Tmax values range from
441 to 443 °C. The very low PI values (0.01–0.02) are
an artifact of the high S2 compared with S1. Figure 6 shows the hydrocarbon yield (L/t) calculated from
the Rock-Eval parameters (yield = S2 ×
1.1).

4.3 Mineralogy and Elemental Composition
The mineralogical composition of the lacustrine oil shale has been
studied extensively and reported in ref (11). Since mineralogy is not the focus of the present
study, only the average composition of the minerals will be presented.
The mineral composition is as follows: quartz (53 wt %), clay minerals
(38 wt %), and feldspar and siderite occur in small quantities.11 Carbonates are rare to absent.

Based on
Swaine (1990),19 the variation of elemental
composition of the oil shale samples is presented here as a grouping
of elements, such as major elements, elements of environmental concern,
other elements, and REEs and their ratios (Table 3–6). The variation
of selected elements vs depth and TOC content is shown in Figure 7a,b. The rate of
sedimentation, which is based on the ratio of Th/U, is shown in Figure 8.

Redox-sensitive trace elements, such as Cr, Mo, Ni,
and V, and
their ratios and relationship to TOC, HI, and organic facies of oil
shales provide information about the position of the sedimentary redox
boundary at the time of deposition and variation of redox with depth
(Figures 9a,b, 10a,b, and 11). The relationship
in the Mn/Ca vs Sr/Ca ratios was used to estimate the rate of terrigenous
input and relative water temperature (Figure 12).

5 Discussion
5.1 Organic Matter Assemblages and Rock-Eval Pyrolysis/TOC
As stated earlier, three types of oil shales are broadly recognized
based on their organic matter assemblages: type A oil shale is similar
to lamosite21 and contains terrestrial
macerals, remnants of lamalginite, and amorphous bituminous matrix
(Table 1 and Figure 3a–c). Vitrinite
in the coastal facies shale shows a granular surface due to leaching
of hydrocarbons. Inertinite displays a cellular morphology, which
indicates that it was deposited close to its source and was not subjected
to fragmentation as a result of long transportation (Figure 3c). Type B oil shale, which
occurs in a transitional shallow facies, contains transported sporinite
displaying zonation with bright rims and pollen grains in a matrix
of lamalginite and matrix bituminite (Figure 4a,b). Inertinite in this facies consists
of small angular fragments, the result of their transportation (Figure 4a,c). Microlayering
of lamalginite in sections perpendicular to the bedding was also observed,
indicating subaqueous deposition of organic matter, which includes
layering of lamalginite, matrix bituminite, vitrinite, and inertinite
(Figure 4c). Type C
oil shale is mostly associated with deep facies (open-water), a Torbanite-type
environment,3,4,21,22 and contains mostly Botryococcus (Pila-type)
algae and some wind-blown sporinite grains (Table 1 and Figure 5a,b).

Although the average hydrogen index (HI)
values of the shale facies vary from 507 to 557 mg HC/g TOC (Table 2), the original HI
(HIo) values were probably 600–700 at immaturity
(Tmax ∼ 430–435 °C)
based on the following equation developed for the Barnett Shale.23 This method is based on maceral percentages
determined by visual kerogen assessment and is expressed as  The S2 values
indicate that the hydrocarbon generating potential is high. The average Tmax values of the three facies have a tight
range, from 441 to 443 °C, which points to the middle stage of
the oil window (thermally mature organic matter). The average TOC,
HI, and hydrocarbon yields of the three oil shale facies (Table 2) show that oil shale
from the shallow facies has the lowest hydrocarbon yield and that
the oil shale from the coastal facies has the highest. Based solely
on the hydrocarbon yield economic threshold and the TOC content proposed
by Yen and Chilingarian (1976)24 (34 L/t
and 6 wt %, respectively), the majority of the oil shale is considered
to be suitable for ex situ extraction (Figure 6).

5.2 Variation of Elements
Numerous studies
have focused on the reconstruction of paleo-environmental conditions
in Devonian-Mississippian black shales in the central-eastern and
southern United States using inorganic geochemical studies, including
major and redox-sensitive elements and other indicators based on proxies.25−28 Other studies used sedimentological or organic geochemistry (biomarker)
approaches.29,30

The trends of major elements
(e.g., Al, Na, Fe, and Ti) with depth of burial for the lacustrine
oil shale (Table 3 and Figure 7a) indicate a variation
in input from the surrounding land and possibly the rate of recharge/discharge.
Most notable is the variation in Ca, which shows two peaks at 59 and
77 m (Figure 7b), which
possibly indicates a higher rate of discharge to recharge, resulting
in a higher rate of carbonate formation. Sulfur follows a trend similar
to that of TOC (Figure 7b), indicating an affinity of S to organic matter. The average elemental
concentration indicates that most elements have almost similar concentrations
in the three facies, except for Al, Ti, and P, which are more concentrated
in the coastal oil shale (Table 3). The average concentration of Ca increases from coastal
toward the deep facies (Table 3).

The depositional environment of the lacustrine oil
shale was determined
based on geology, sedimentology, variation in organic matter composition,
and boron content. Boron (B) is in the range of 28–54 ppm (Table 4), typical of freshwater
lacustrine setting (e.g., Hat Creek coal deposit, British Columbia,
Canada,31−34 and other coal seams that were deposited under freshwater-influenced
environments).35,36 Thus, the oil shale was deposited
in a freshwater lacustrine environment. Average concentrations of
elements for three facies are informative and indicate that some elements
such as Cd, Cr, Mo, Ni, Pb, and V are more concentrated in the coastal
facies; by contrast, average Cu, U, and Zn concentrations are higher
in the deep facies (Table 4).

5.2.1 Rate of Sedimentation
Weathering
has little effect on Th concentration.37 Thorium is relatively immobile in sediments during weathering and
transport.38−41 Weathering and sedimentary recycling result in the loss of U and
increase in the Th/U ratio in sedimentary rocks.39 In general, higher values of Th/U indicate a higher rate
of sedimentation and the allochthonous origin of U.

The Th/U
ratio can be used as an indicator of the rate of sedimentation, weathering,
and transportation. The variations of Th/U in the oil shale (Figure 8) are very informative
and indicate three sedimentation periods: an irregular but slow rate
of sedimentation (I) from the base of the section up to 68 m, followed
by a relatively regular and slow sedimentation (II) in the interval
between 68 and 53 m, and, finally, a faster rate of sedimentation
(III) in the upper part between 53 and 31.7 m (Figure 8). The higher Th/U ratio in periods I and
II also supports a slower rate of sedimentation due to the input of
allochthonous U. Interestingly, the other alkali metal elements, such
Cs, Li, and Rb, follow almost a similar pattern (not shown) to that
of Th/K.

5.2.2 Paleo-Redox Conditions
Redox conditions
occur at the sediment–water interface, as well as in the water
column. They consist of dysoxic condition with low oxygen concentration
(2.0–0.2 mg/L), suboxic condition with very low oxygen content
(0.2–0.0 mg/L), and anoxic condition with no oxygen.42 Redox-sensitive trace elements provide information
about the position of the sedimentary redox boundary at the time of
deposition. The bottom-water oxygen levels in marine settings were
evaluated by their elemental composition such as As, Co, Cr, Mo, Ni,
Pb, V, and U.43−53 Uranium, Mo, and V diffuse into the sediments during early diagenesis54 under oxic conditions, and Co and Ni are released
to the sediments during organic matter decomposition in highly productive
environments55−58 under anoxic conditions. The ratios of V/Cr, V/Mo, U/Mo, and Re/Mo
can be used to determine paleo-redox conditions.25

With the above in mind, the variations of Cr, Ni,
V, and U and their ratios with TOC and HI were used to determine the
paleo-redox in the oil shale deposit. The variation of Cr to V + Ni
was also used in the present study to group the oil shales into suboxic
(Cr: 10–20 ppm) for deep facies and dysoxic (Cr: >40) for
coastal-shallow
facies (Figure 9a).
The vanadium-to-Cr (V/Cr) ratio is a more sensitive indicator of paleo-redox,
with V/Cr of <2 indicating oxic conditions, a ratio of 2–4.25
indicating dysoxic conditions, and a ratio >4.25 indicating suboxic
to anoxic conditions.44 Using the V/Cr
ratio with Ni + V, samples in the coastal-shallow facies were deemed
to have deposited under oxic–dysoxic conditions (Figure 9b). A similar grouping was
also found when the V/Cr ratio was plotted vs the hydrogen index and
TOC (Figure 10a,b).

The presence of Botryococcus telalginite in the oil shale in the
deep facies (Figure 5) is an indication of a deeper and more open lake environment with
suboxic–dysoxic conditions, as depicted by Cr and the V/Cr
ratio (Figure 9a,b).
The high organic productivity by phytoplankton and bacteria (eutrophic
condition), characterized by the low V/Cr ratio in the oil shale,
is an indication that the upper water level (epilimnion) was both
well-oxygenated and uniform in temperature (20 °C) representing
an oxic–dysoxic environment of a stratified lake above the
thermocline. The hydrogen-rich organic sediment (sapropel), interpreted
to have originated from algal blooms, is mixed with fine particulate
matter and was deposited in the deeper parts of the lake in the oxygen-poor
and cold (5 °C) temperature (hypolimnion). Hypolimnion is characterized
by suboxic–anoxic conditions and a high V/Cr ratio. The variation
of the V/Cr ratio with HI and TOC (Figure 10a,b) also shows a similar pattern to that
of the V/Cr ratio vs Ni + V (Figure 9b).

5.2.2.1 Uranium
Uranium in mudrock successions
is partially terrestrial.59 Uranium is
mostly associated with the organic fraction (organic ligands).60,61 Anoxic bottom waters, combined with high organic productivity of
the aerated upper part of the water column, promote uranium diffusion
out of the water or pore water into the anoxic horizons, forming organometallic
and/or metallic complexes.62 Therefore,
U concentrations can be used as an index for bottom-water anoxia.63 In this study, the variation of Cr with U was
used to determine the redox conditions of the oil shale (Figure 11). The samples
from the deep facies have low Cr (<20 ppm), which indicates their
suboxic conditions. However, the coastal-shallow facies appear to
consist of two groups; one group includes samples from the coastal
and three shallow facies (samples 1, 3, 4, and 11), while the other
group includes only the shallow facies (samples 5, 7, 8, and 10) (Figure 11).

5.2.3 Paleo-Temperature
The Sr and Mn
concentrations are used to determine the paleo-temperature and salinity/brackishness
of the depositional environment.64,65 The variation
of Sr/Ca and Mn/Ca ratios was also used to determine the temperature
and rate of recycling of terrigenous input in the marine Second White
Specks oil shales in Manitoba, Canada.65 The high Sr/Ca ratio is an indication of high temperatures, and
the high Mn/Ca ratio indicates a higher input of terrigenous sediments.65 In this study, the associations of Mn and Sr
with Ca (carbonate) and Mn/Ca vs Sr/Ca ratios in the oil shale (Figure 12) were used to
estimate the paleo-temperature and sedimentary influx.64,65

The oil shale from the Big Marsh deposit has high Mn/Ca and
low Sr/Ca (Figure 12). The high Mn/Ca ratio is due to high terrigenous influx. This interpretation
is supported by the mineralogy of the oil shales, which contain high
amounts of quartz and clay minerals (52.7 and 38 wt %).11 The low Sr/Ca ratio in the oil shale that contains
almost no carbonate minerals11 is a possible
indication of low temperature.

5.2.4 Rare Earth Elements
Rare earth
elements (REEs) have similar chemical and physical properties due
to their specific electronic configurations and are divided into two
subgroups: the light rare earth elements (LREEs) from La–Sm
and the heavy rare earth elements (HREEs) from Eu to Lu.66 REEs have received considerable attention due
to the systematic variation of their behavior known as the “lanthanide
contraction”. REEs have been used to explain a number of geochemical
event/processes in the environment, such as origin of certain sediments,
paleo-environmental and paleo-oceanic changes, weathering, and impact
of anthropogenic sources.67−81

The variation of REEs in sedimentary rocks has been studied
by a number of authors.82−84 The REEs are often associated
with clay minerals in coal and are likely to be absorbed on the surface
of the clay–size fraction85,86 and on minerals
such as rutile (Ti), zircon (Zr), monazite (Th), xenotime (Y), and
chromite (Cr).87 The abundance of REEs
in coal seams has been examined by numerous researchers.33,34,87−90 However, there is very little
information on the abundance and behavior of REEs in oil shales (Table 5).

REEs are in high demand due to their use in various
industrial
applications, which have increased in the past several decades, particularly
for some of the REEs such as Nd, Ho, and Yb. China has most of the
REE reserves and produces over 95% of the world’s rare earth
supply.91,92 Therefore, it is important to find new sources
of REEs. Hydrocarbons from oil shales are extracted by retorting at
temperatures of <500 °C. The heat-treated byproduct of oil
shale could be a good source of REEs. Therefore, it is very important
to characterize an oil shale deposit and determine its REEs content.
Based on a comparison with coal, the REEs in oil shale are primarily
associated with the inorganic fraction. In general, the controls on
REEs distribution and occurrence in organic-rich sedimentary rocks
such as coal appear to be related to the mineralogical composition
of the country rock and to the weathering process.81,87−90

5.2.4.1 REEs in the Oil Shale
The concentration
of REEs in the lacustrine oil shale is summarized in Table 6. For comparative purposes, the REEs and their total concentrations
in each of the three facies are presented in Table 6 and Figure 13. The concentration of REEs in the oil shale is heterogeneous
and depends on their depositional location and water depth. The total
LREEs (La–Sm) are remarkably more concentrated in the coastal
oil shale facies, which has the highest concentration of LREEs (605
ppm) out of a total REEs of 648 ppm (Table 6 and Figure 13). This trend indicates a possible association with
a higher input of aluminosilicates and accessory minerals in the coastal
facies. The oil shale deposited in the shallow-water facies has total
REEs of 184 ppm and LREEs of 152 ppm, which is less than that found
in the oil shale deposited in the coastal facies (Table 6 and Figure 13). The oil shale deposited in the deep-water
facies at the center of the lake also has low total REEs (269 ppm)
and LREEs (233 ppm). This relationship between REEs for the various
depositional settings/depths indicates an association of LREE with
sedimentary input, and possibly quartz and accessory minerals, which
are depleted/reduced in the oil shale deposited in the shallow facies
of the lake. The latter zone contains mostly fine clay-marl and a
higher carbonate content compared with the other zones (even though
the oil shale is very poor in carbonates). The LREEs also follow a
similar trend to that of concentration of both REEs and HREEs (Table 6 and Figure 13) The LREEs/HRREs ratio is
very informative as it is related to the depositional facies. It is
the highest in the coastal facies (Table 6 and Figure 13), indicative of sedimentary sorting and progressive
deposition of fine clay and carbonates toward the deep facies although
the latter group is barely registering in the above figure because
of the absence of carbonate minerals in the oil shale.

5.2.4.2 PAAS-Corrected REEs
The PAAS-normalized
REEs in the oil shale fall into three different trends (Figure 14). As noted earlier,
type A oil shale was deposited in the coastal facies of the lake and
contains terrestrial organic matter and some lamalginite (Figure 3) and has an average
TOC content of 7.3 wt % (Table 2). The PAAS-corrected patterns of REEs display a strong negative
Eu anomaly18 and enrichment of LREE (La–Sm)
as compared with HREE (Eu–Lu) (Figure 14). Type B oil shale was deposited nearshore
in the shallow facies, contains some allochthonous terrestrial kerogen
(Figure 4), and has
lower TOC (5.8 wt %) (Table 2) and coarser sediments. Type B oil shale displays an enrichment
of HREE compared with LREE and also shows a moderate negative Eu anomaly
(Figure 14), which
is similar to that documented for the upper continental crust20 and for sediments from Lake Baikal, Russia.93 Type B oil shale also has a much lower concentration
of LREE (La–Sm) than type A oil shale and almost a similar
HREE (Eu–Lu) content to type A (Figure 14). Type C oil shale was deposited in the
deep facies near the center of the lake, contains Botryococcus algae
(Figure 5), and has
low terrestrial kerogen and higher carbonate content (relatively speaking)
compared with the other two groups. The PAAS-corrected REEs pattern
displays a weak to very weak Eu anomaly, and the concentration of
PAAS-normalized REEs increases continuously from LREE toward HREE
(Figure 14). Furthermore,
a reduction in the negative Eu anomaly with increasing depth of deposition
is apparent, possibly being related to the sedimentary sorting that
results in the accumulation of finer sediments such as clays in the
deeper water/central part of the lake.93

5.2.5 Economic Feasibility and Elements of Environmental
Concern
In general, the concentration of most elements in
this group for some of the oil shale samples is similar to and/or
lower than the world shale values20 (Table 4). However, there
are some samples with a higher concentration of hazardous elements
(e.g., As, Cd, Mo, and Se) (Figure 15), which indicates that there is a possibility that
some of these elements may be released into the environment during
the hydrocarbon extraction process, particularly during ex situ extraction.
Most of the hazardous elements are mobilized at much higher temperatures,
particularly those associated with pyrite/sulfides (As, Cd, Se). Decomposition
of pyrite into pyrrhotite (FeS) and elemental sulfur starts at 540
°C,94 which is a higher temperature
than the temperature used for extraction of hydrocarbons during ex
situ operations (generally less than 500 °C).23 So, it is unlikely that extraction of the oil shale will
release elemental sulfur from the decomposition of sulfides or sulfates.
However, a detailed study of the mode of occurrence and speciation
of these elements95−102 is required if this lacustrine oil shale is to be considered as
feedstock for the extraction of hydrocarbons.

6 Conclusions
The present study indicates
the following:The oil shale studied was deposited in a lacustrine
environment with boron content in the range from 28 to 54 ppm, which
is typical of a freshwater depositional environment.

Petrology of the oil shale indicates three broadly distinct
types. Type A oil shale was deposited in coastal facies with organic
matter consisting of vitrinite, inertinite, and sporinite, along with
some lamalginite and amorphous bituminous matrix (bituminite). Type
B oil shale was deposited in a shallow facies of the lake and contains
mostly lamalginite and some terrestrial organic matter, such as vitrinite
and sporinite. Type C oil shale was deposited in a deep facies near
the center of the lake and is associated with open-water Torbanite-type
oil shale and contains mostly Botryococcus colonial algae.

The oil shale samples analyzed are thermally
mature
and have Tmax values that range from 441
to 443 °C, average TOC of 5.8–7.3 wt %, HI values that
range between 505 and 557 mg HC/g TOC, and are considered to be very
good candidates for the ex situ extraction of hydrocarbons based on
their hydrocarbon yield.

The rate of
sedimentation of the oil shale section,
as determined by the Th/U ratio, indicates three sedimentation periods:
an irregular but slow rate of sedimentation at the base and a regular
and slow sedimentation in the middle, followed by a fast rate toward
the top of the section.

The redox conditions
of the oil shale section based
on a variation of Cr to U, V + Ni, and Cr/U ratios indicate the following:
oil shale that was deposited under coastal-shallow facies was deposited
in dysoxic conditions and is characterized by a uniformly high Cr
content. In contrast, oil shale deposited in deep facies and under
suboxic conditions has a higher Cr content.

The redox conditions determined using the V/Cr ratio
to the V + Ni ratio, TOC, and HI are mirror images of Cr, with the
coastal-shallow facies deposited under oxic–dysoxic conditions
and having a low V/Cr ratio, while those deposited in deep facies
are characterized by a high V/Cr ratio.

The Sr/Ca and Mn/Ca ratios indicate that the oil shale
was deposited under colder water with high terrigenous influx.

There are three different trends for PAAS-normalized
REEs. Type A oil shale was deposited in the coastal facies of the
lake and displays a moderate negative Eu anomaly. There is enrichment
of LREE compared with HREE. Type B oil shale was deposited near the
shore in the shallow facies and displays an enrichment of HREE compared
with LREE and a strong negative Eu anomaly similar to that in the
upper continental crust. Type C oil shale was deposited in deeper
water facies near the center of the lake and displays a weak to very
weak Eu anomaly. The concentration of REEs increases continuously
from LREE toward HREE.

Type A oil shale
has the highest concentration of total
REEs (648 ppm) and LREEs (605 ppm) compared with type C, which has
269 ppm and 233 ppm, respectively. Type 2 oil shale has the lowest
total REEs at 184 ppm and LREEs at 152 ppm.

The concentration of HREEs changes very little and decreases
from 43 ppm in type A oil shale to 36 ppm in type C oil shale.

Elements of environmental concern in the
oil shale have
similar and/or lower concentration to that of the world shale. However,
there are instances of higher concentrations of hazardous elements
(e.g., As, Cd, Mo, and Se) than in world shale, which may require
monitoring.
