With the rapid
depletion of high-yield copper mineral resources and the accumulation
of secondary copper resources, the recycling of secondary copper is
gaining popularity in the copper industry. A copper anode furnace,
often used in copper recycling, usually relies on methane combustion
to melt copper scraps. In this work, a computational fluid dynamics
(CFD) model of pure oxy-methane combustion is established to investigate
the combustion characteristics of the CH4/O2 combustor in the copper anode furnace. The model is
validated by comparing the simulation results with experimental measurements.
The effects on flame length and temperature distribution are investigated
under various fuel velocities, oxidizer velocities, and oxidizer temperatures.
The results indicate that flame length and temperature distribution
increase as the fuel velocity and oxidizer temperature increase, and
decrease with the increase in oxidizer velocity. The flame length
and temperature distribution always show an increasing trend with
the increasing equivalence ratio. Based on the recycling capacity
of the copper anode furnace, this validated CFD model can be used
to optimize the operation parameters for controlling flame length
and temperature distribution.

1 Introduction
With the rapid
depletion of high-yield mineral resources, secondary
copper resources have become an important materials supply for copper
smelting industries. There are several types of equipment for recycling
secondary copper in the copper industry: Kaldo furnace, tilting furnace,
rotary anode furnace, and stationary reverberatory furnace.1−3 In each equipment, the main recycling
processes are the melting process and refining process. The conventional
melting process relies on fossil fuel combustion, using heavy oil
or natural gas as the fuel and air as the oxidizer. However, it is
inevitable to generate nitric oxides (NOx), which are some of the main air pollutants when using air or oxygen-enriched
air as the oxidizer.

Oxy-fuel combustion technology is gradually
gaining popularity in the industrial production of copper, aluminum,
iron, and steel because of its inherent advantages. Compared with
the conventional combustion, oxy-fuel combustion has higher combustion
efficiency, lower volumes of exhaust gas, lower fuel consumption,
higher melting capacity, and lower NOx emission.4 Especially when using pure
oxygen combustion, NOx emission can theoretically
be avoided altogether. In addition, compared
with pulverized coal, kerosene, and heavy oil, methane is widely used
as the industrial fuel for its clean and high calorific value advantages.
Because of the aforementioned relative advantages, related studies5−8 of
oxy-methane combustion have been reported to promote a wide range
of industrial applications of this technology. For example, Dam et
al.5 investigated the flame stability of
CH4/O2 combustion experimentally and found that
the stability regime of all compositions decreases as the burner diameter
increases. Ditaranto et al.6 studied the
coaxial CH4/O2 flame structure, and the results
showed that the decrease in annular jet momentum leads to better turbulent
mixing and, therefore, reduces the flame length. Li et al.7 carried out the experimental investigations of
oxy-combustion in a laboratory-scale furnace and found that the furnace
temperature rises slightly as the equivalence ratio increases. Shakeel
et al.8 simulated the CH4/O2 combustion under various reaction mechanisms and found that
the combinations of Jones–Lindstedt reaction mechanism and
weighted sum of gray gas model (WSGGM) model gave the closest approximation
to the experimental temperature profile.

The copper anode furnace
is a common equipment for refining blister copper to anode copper
in the copper industry.9,10 The furnace is a rotatable cylindrical
furnace, which equips a CH4/O2 combustor on
the end wall to provide heat to keep warm and melt solid materials.
Because of the high-grade copper content in secondary copper, it is
a feasible method to remelt and refine secondary copper in the anode
furnace for copper recovery.2,11 However, there have
been relatively few investigations of oxy-fuel combustion characteristics
in the copper anode furnace. During the melting process of secondary
copper resources in the copper anode furnace, the most important technological
parameters that need to be controlled are flame length and temperature
distribution. There should be an optimum value for the flame length
to make sure that the temperature is distributed uniformly in the
furnace and, on the other hand, the flame does not contact the melt
directly to prevent the melt peroxidation. Kim et al.12 measured the flame lengths of turbulent oxy-fuel flames
by using the visual determination method under a wide range of fuel
nozzle diameters and oxidizer velocities. On this basis, Mei et al.13,14 defined a chemical flame length by carbon monoxide ratio at RCO = XCO/XCOmax = 0.01 for methane combustion, and the
results indicated that this definition is more accurate than the other
methods, such as those defined by RO =
0.09, yCO/yCO2 = 0.002,
and so on.15−21

In order to investigate
the effects of various velocities of fuel and oxidizer on flame length
and temperature distribution, the definition of RCO = 0.01 will be adopted for measuring the flame length
of the specific CH4/O2 combustor in this work.
Moreover, the waste heat generated in the copper smelting industry
can be utilized for reheating gases. To improve energy efficiency
of the CH4/O2 combustor, the effects of various
oxygen temperatures are also investigated. The aim of this work is
to investigate the combustion characteristics of the CH4/O2 combustor, especially the effects of fuel velocities,
oxidizer velocities, and oxidizer temperatures on flame length and
temperature distribution, to provide guidance for optimizing the operating
parameters in the secondary copper resources recovery process.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Mesh Independence Study
In order to avoid the potential error caused by the mesh, three different
mesh levels, coarse mesh (69 000 cells), medium mesh (135 000
cells), and fine mesh (210 000 cells), were used to check the
mesh independence. The mole fractions of CO and H2 along
the X axis are plotted in Figure 1 under three different mesh levels. As shown
in Figure 1, the coarse
mesh cannot reflect the mole fractions of CO and H2 correctly,
whereas after improving the mesh number to medium level and fine level,
the variation between the medium mesh and the fine mesh is less than
1%. For the purpose of saving computing time and resources, the medium
mesh was adopted in this simulation.

fractions of CO (a) and H2 (b) obtained under three mesh
levels.

2.2 Effects of Various Fuel Velocities
With
the development of large-scale production and large-scale equipment
in the copper industry, energy consumption increases dramatically.
Accordingly, the injection speed of natural gas is increased as the
consumption of natural gas increases. Hence, it is necessary to investigate
the changes of flame length and temperature distribution at various
fuel velocities in the furnace. The oxygen velocity is set as a constant,
and the detailed parameters used in the model are described in Table 1.

Table 1 Parameters
Used in the CFD Model
case	fuel velocity (m/s)	TCH4(K)	oxidizer velocity (m/s)	TO2(K)	equivalence
ratio	
1	30	300	100	300	0.72	
2	40	300	100	300	0.96	
3	50	300	100	300	1.20	
4	60	300	100	300	1.44	
5	70	300	100	300	1.69	
6	80	300	100	300	1.93	
7	90	300	100	300	2.17	
8	100	300	100	300	2.41	
According
to Figure 2a, both
the flame length and equivalence ratio increase as fuel velocity increases.
Because the equivalence ratio is proportional to the fuel velocity,
the flame length increases with the increasing equivalence ratio.
As is well-known, fuel is excess when the equivalence ratio is greater
than 1, whereas oxidizer is excess, when the equivalence ratio is
less than 1. The combustion would theoretically achieve completion,
when the equivalence ratio equals 1. In the simulation, combustion
transforms from oxygen-enriched to methane-enriched as the equivalence
ratio increases from 0.72 to 2.41. It can be seen from Figure 3 that the maximal mole fractions
of CO, H2, and H2O along the X axis reduce obviously as fuel velocity increases except for CO2. As discussed in the refs,14,17 almost all CO2 is
converted directly from CO in CH4/O2 combustion.
Hence, the changing trend of maximal mole fraction of CO is dependent
on the extent of the combustion reactions because CO is an intermediate
chemical product. Because of the reduction of equivalence ratio, methane
combustion transforms from complete combustion to incomplete combustion
which results in a gradual decrease in maximal mole fraction of CO.
For the same reason, the maximal mole fraction of H2 decreases
as fuel velocity increases.

energy (b), and turbulent dissipation rate (c) profiles at various
fuel velocities.

Figure 3 Mole fractions of CO (a), H2 (b),
CO2 (c), and H2O (d) along the X axis at
various fuel velocities.

Moreover, Figure 2b,c report the turbulence kinetic energy
and turbulent dissipation rate increase with the increasing fuel velocity
and have gradually increasing distribution zones along the X axis. The mass flow rate of fuel increases with an increase
in fuel velocity at a constant oxidizer concentration. These results
imply that the increase in fuel velocity enhances the turbulent mixing,
which results in an increase in the turbulent dissipation rate. Although
the improvement in turbulent mixing can accelerate the combustion
reactions to lead to rapid CO oxidation, the increasing fuel velocity
plays a more significant role in fuel diffusion, which expands the
combustion zone in the furnace. It is the reason that the distributions
of mole fractions of CO, H2, CO2, and H2O along the X axis show increasing tendencies
with the increase in fuel velocity in Figure 3. Similar to the results obtained by Tang
et al.,22 the increase in fuel velocity
leads to an increasing tendency in flame length and temperature distribution
shown in Figures 2a
and 4. Moreover, a similar phenomenon was observed
in Xi’s experiments,23 which investigated
the effect of fuel mass flow rate on flame length. They attributed
the increase in flame length to the enhancement of fuel axial and
radial diffusion, which is in accordance with the increasing trend
of turbulence kinetic energy as shown in Figure 2.

Figure 4 Temperature distribution

the unit of length is m.

It can be concluded that with the
increase in the turbulence kinetic energy, the turbulent mixing of
fuel and oxidizer is enhanced, which leads to an expansion of the
combustion zone in the furnace. The transportation of species and
energy transfer show great improvement as well and increase the flame
length and temperature distribution. As a result, fuel velocity plays
a significant role in flame length and temperature distribution. However,
the optimal fuel velocity should be selected according to the capacity
of the copper anode furnace to avoid wasting fuel resources.

2.3 Effects of Various Oxidizer
Velocities
To investigate the effects of various oxidizer
velocities on flame length and temperature distribution, the fuel
velocity is set as a constant and the detailed parameters of various
oxidizer velocities are shown in Table 2. The results are shown below.

Table 2 Parameters of Various Oxidizer Velocities
Used in the CFD Model
case	fuel velocity (m/s)	TCH4 (K)	oxidizer velocity (m/s)	TO2 (K)	equivalence
ratio	
1	40	300	70	300	1.38	
2	40	300	80	300	1.20	
3	40	300	90	300	1.07	
4	40	300	95	300	1.01	
5	40	300	100	300	0.96	
6	40	300	105	300	0.92	
As shown in Figure 5a, the flame length
and the equivalence ratio decrease gradually with the increase in
oxidizer velocity. Because of the equivalence ratio exhibiting a negative
linear relationship with oxidizer velocity, the flame length shows
a similar increasing trend with the increasing of equivalence ratio,
which is consistent with Figure 2a. Figure 5b,c depict the increase in turbulence kinetic energy and turbulent
dissipation rate with the increase in oxidizer velocity. However,
compared with Figure 2b, the difference in Figure 5b is that the distribution of turbulence kinetic energy along
the X axis has almost the same area under various
oxidizer velocities. It implies that the increase in oxidizer velocity
plays a smaller role in turbulence diffusion than the effect of fuel
velocity.

Figure 5 Flame length and equivalence
ratio (a), turbulence
kinetic ratio (b), and turbulent dissipation rate (c) profiles at
various oxidizer velocities.

According to Figure 6, the distributions of mole fractions of CO, H2, CO2, and H2O have decreasing trends
along the X axis as the oxidizer velocity increases.
Moreover, the maximal mole fractions of CO, H2, and H2O increase with the increase in oxidizer velocity. Considering
the changing trend of equivalence ratio, the combustion transforms
from oxidizer lean to fuel lean as the oxidizer velocity increases.
The extent of combustion reactions are improved gradually with the
increasing oxidizer velocity, which lead to an increase in the maximal
mole fraction of CO. The turbulent mixing is enhanced with the increase
in oxidizer velocity, so CO oxidation is speeded up, which shortens
the distributions of CO and CO2 mole fractions along the X axis. These results are found to be in good agreement
with the measurements from Degenève et al.,24 who reported a reduction in the potential core length of
the central jet with the increasing annular momentum ratio.

of CO (a), H2 (b),
CO2 (c), and H2O (d) along the X axis profiles at various oxidizer velocities.

Figure 7 reports that
the temperature distribution in the furnace shows a decreasing tendency
with the increase in oxidizer velocity. Different from the effect
of the inner core fuel stream, the outer annular oxidizer stream constitutes
the envelope of the flame and has little influence on the internal
species transport and energy transfer along the X axis. Theoretically, with the decrease in equivalence ratio from
1.38 to 0.92, the total heat released by the combustion reactions
would tend to increase. However, with the oxidizer velocity increasing,
the excess mass flow rate of the oxidizer gas increases and takes
away more heat. Therefore, under a constant fuel velocity, there should
be an optimal oxidizer velocity to realize the most efficient use
of heat in the furnace.

2.4 Effects of Various Oxidizer Temperature
In order to
meet the target of improving energy resource utilization and reducing
products cost, waste heat generated in the copper industry can be
used to preheat the oxidizer gas. Because a change in temperature
can affect gas density, turbulence viscosity, and turbulence kinetic
energy, and then affect the combustion characteristics,25 it is necessary to investigate the change trends
of flame length and temperature distribution at various oxidizer temperatures.
The detailed parameters used in the computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
model are shown in Table 3, and the results are shown below.

Table 3 Parameters of Various Oxidizer Temperature
Used in the CFD Model

ratio	
1	40	300	100	300	0.96	
2	40	300	100	375	1.21	
3	40	300	100	575	1.85	
4	40	300	100	775	2.50	
5	40	300	100	975	3.14	
6	40	300	100	1175	3.78	
As shown in Figure 8a,b, the flame length
increases with the increase in oxidizer temperature, while the turbulence
kinetic energy and the distribution of turbulence kinetic energy along
the X axis decrease. Figure 8c depicts the decreasing trends of turbulent
dissipation rate and the distribution along the X axis with the increase in oxidizer temperature. As analyzed in Tang
et al.’s work,25 the increasing
oxidizer temperature reduces the turbulence viscosity which results
in a reduction in gas entrainment and an increase in flame length.
The reducing turbulence viscosity leads to a decrease in the turbulent
dissipation rate, which is consistent with Figure 8c. In addition, as gas density will decrease
with the increase in oxidizer temperature, the mass flow rate of oxidizer
gas decreases gradually at a constant inlet velocity, which results
in a decrease in the total kinetic energy carried into the furnace.
As a consequence, reducing the oxidizer gas mass flow rate results
in an increase in the equivalence ratio but a decrease in turbulence
kinetic energy. It is interesting to note that the flame length shows
an increasing trend with the increase in the equivalence ratio, which
is in good agreement with the effects of fuel velocity and oxidizer
velocity.

Figure 8 Flame length
and equivalence
ratio (a), turbulence kinetic energy (b), and turbulent dissipation
rate (c) profiles along the X axis at various oxidizer
temperatures.

Figure 9 reports that the maximal mole fractions of CO, H2, and
H2O decrease as the oxidizer temperature increases, whereas
the distributions increase along the X axis. This
phenomenon can be explained by the same reason mentioned previously
that as the equivalence ratio increases, the combustion transforms
from fuel lean to oxidizer lean and the extent of combustion reactions
is suppressed gradually. As CO and H2 are intermediate
products, their maximal mole fractions are dependent on the extent
of combustion reactions and therefore show a decreasing tendency.
The increase in turbulence kinetic energy can enhance the turbulence
mixing and accelerate the combustion reaction rates to result in more
rapid oxidation of CO and H2 at a shorter distance. This
is why the distributions of mole fractions of CO, H2, CO2, and H2O show increasing trends along the X axis with the increase in oxidizer temperature.

Figure 9 Mole fractions of CO (a), H2 (b),
CO2 (c), and H2O (d) along the X axis at
various oxidizer temperatures.

As shown in Figure 10, the temperature distribution tends to increase with the increase
in oxidizer temperature. Actually, the total heat released by combustion
decreases with the increasing equivalence ratio at a constant fuel
input. However, the temperature distribution is getting more and more
uniform in the furnace with the increasing oxidizer temperature. It
means raising oxidizer gas temperature can not only increase energy
efficiency but also improve the uniformity of temperature distribution.

temperatures.

3 Conclusions
In the present work, the combustion characteristics of the CH4/O2 combustor in a copper anode furnace have been
investigated by numerical simulation. The effects of various fuel
velocities, oxidizer velocities, and oxidizer temperatures on flame
length and temperature distribution were studied. Several conclusions
can be drawn:(1) Both
flame length and temperature distribution in the furnace increase
with the increase in fuel velocity, whereas the maximal mole fractions
of CO, H2, CO2, and H2O show decreasing
tendencies. Compared with the effect on turbulent mixing, the increasing
fuel velocity plays a more significant role in fuel diffusion and
expands the combustion zone in the furnace.

(2) The flame length and temperature distribution
show decreasing trends with the increase in oxidizer velocity at a
constant fuel velocity, whereas the maximal mole fractions of CO,
H2, CO2, and H2O increase. Different
from the effect of inner core fuel stream, the increase in oxidizer
velocity has a greater influence on the turbulent mixing and speeds
up the oxidation of CO.

(3) The flame length and temperature distribution increase as the oxidizer
temperature increases. The increase in temperature results in the
reduction of turbulent viscosity and gas density. The reduction in
turbulent viscosity leads to a decrease in gas entrainment which increases
the flame length. However, the reduced gas density leads to a decrease
in gas mass flow rate, which increases the maximal mole fractions
of CO, H2, CO2, and H2O. The increasing
oxidizer temperature can not only increase energy efficiency, but
also improve the uniformity of temperature distribution.

Section
4.1 Geometry Model
Considering the research objective of the CH4/O2 combustor of the copper anode furnace, the interaction between
the flame and copper melt during the melting process is ignored in
the CFD model. The CH4/O2 combustor is a coaxial
double tube construction, as shown in Figure 11a, of which the outer tube is for pure oxygen
and the inner tube is for natural gas. The geometry of the model is
shown in Figure 11b, and an axisymmetric computational domain was applied in the model
to reduce computational time and effort.

Figure 11 Structure of CH4/O2 combustor (a)
and the sketch of geometric model (b), length unit is mm.

4.2 Numerical Model
In this work, a CFD
model was developed to investigate the combustion characteristics
of the CH4/O2 combustor in the copper anode
furnace. The chemical flame length in the numerical model is obtained
by the definition of carbon monoxide ratio as RCO = XCO/XCOmax = 0.01, where XCO is the
local mole fraction of carbon monoxide and XCOmax is the maximum mole fraction of carbon monoxide of the
combustion components. According to the refined 4-step global mechanism26 of methane combustion described in Table 4, carbon monoxide
is regarded as the last intermediate product and the ratio of RCO = 0.01 can approximately represent the border
of the reaction zone. In the simulation model, a contour of RCO = 0.01 is used as the reaction zone border
and the flame length is the horizontal distance measured from the
outlet of the combustor to the right endpoint of the border as depicted
in Figure 12.

The governing equations were solved using the commercial software
ANSYS 18.1. The Reynolds number of the fuel larger than 62 673
(Vfuel = 30 m/s) indicates that the flow
is a turbulent flow in the CFD model. To simulate the turbulence behavior
of the flow, the modified standard k–ε
turbulence model with the standard wall functions was used as the
turbulent model.27 For the species transport
model, the eddy dissipation concept (EDC) model28 with a refined 4-step global mechanism26 was used to solve the species conservation and transportation.
The discrete ordinate radiation model was employed with WSGGM29 as well in the present work.

4.4 Turbulence
Model
The turbulence kinetic energy, k,
and its rate of dissipation, ε, are obtained from the following
transport equations 8   9  where Gk and Gb is the generation of turbulence
kinetic energy due to the mean velocity gradient and buoyancy, respectively. YM represents the contribution of the fluctuating
dilatation in compressible turbulence to the overall dissipation rate. C1ε, C2ε, and C3ε are constants.

Generally speaking, the standard k–ε
turbulence model can be used for a wide range of turbulent flows for
its economy and reasonable accuracy advantages. However, the standard k–ε turbulence model has a limit in the accuracy
when the flow is located in a limited zone in which the effect of
molecular viscosity would play an important role and cannot be ignored.
Christo and Dally.27 and Frassoldati et
al.30 investigated the effects of four
different turbulence models (the modified k–ε
turbulence model, standard k–ε turbulence
model, renormalization group k–ε model,
and realizable k–ε model), and they
found that the modified k–ε turbulence
model has more significant accuracy than the other three turbulence
models. As adopted in the reference for simulating methane combustion,31−33 the modified k–ε standard model was used in the present work and the
coefficient C1ε of the standard k–ε turbulence model is modified from 1.44
to 1.6.

4.5 Solution
Method
In this work, the commercial software ANSYS Fluent
18.1 was used to simulate the oxy-fuel combustion process. The pressure-based
solver was used to adjust the pressure and velocities after each iteration
when solving the gas continuity and momentum equations. The finite
volume method was used to solve the partial differential equations
by discretizing the equations using an upwind differencing scheme
over the finite volumes. The pseudo-transient option was set to improve
the stability and convergence during the calculation.

The detailed
boundary conditions in this simulation can be described as: the velocity
inlet boundary conditions are employed for the annular oxygen inlet
and natural gas inlet. The pressure outlet boundary condition is employed
for the outlet and the gauge pressure is set to 0 Pa. The wall surface
adopts the nonslip boundary condition and the near wall area adopts
the standard wall surface function. The wall temperature and internal
emissivity are fixed as 453 K and 0.9, respectively.

5 Validation
The same
geometry described in ref (14) was used to validate the feasibility of the numerical model
mentioned above. The flame lengths obtained in this simulation were
compared with the flame lengths obtained in ref (14) by CFD modeling and obtained
in ref (12) through
experimental means. The comparison diagram is shown in Figure 13.

Figure 13 Comparison
diagram of
flame lengths under various fuel velocity.

As shown in Figure 13, the results of
the CFD model have good agreement with the results of ref (14) and the average error
is less than 5%. The flame lengths of the numerical model have nearly
identical changing trend compared with the experimental results obtained
by Kim et al.12 This suggests that the
numerical model may be suitable for the CH4/O2 combustor in this work.
