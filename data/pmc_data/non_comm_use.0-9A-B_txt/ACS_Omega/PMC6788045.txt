This work reports the preparation, characterization,
and O2/N2 separation properties of composite
membranes based on the polymer of intrinsic microporosity (PIM-1)
and the zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8). Especially, the composite
membranes were prepared by growing ZIF-8 nanoparticles on one side
of the PIM-1 membrane in methanol. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
and thermo-gravimetric analysis indicated that there is no strong
chemical interaction between ZIF-8 nanoparticles and PIM-1 chains.
Scanning electron microscopy images showed that ZIF-8 nanoparticles
adhere well to the PIM-1 membrane surface. The pure-gas permeation
results confirmed that growth of ZIF-8 on the PIM-1 membrane can enhance
the performance of O2/N2 separation. Particularly,
the O2/N2 separation performance of the PIM-1/ZIF-8-7
composite membrane exceeds the Robeson upper bound line.

Introduction
In the
past decades, membrane-based air separation to produce oxygen
has been of special interest for chemists because of the versatile
applications in furnace air enrichment, fuel cells, medical respiration,
and so on.1−3 The polymer
of intrinsic microporosity (PIM-1) is one of the most potential materials
for air separation as it shows unusually high O2 permeability
and moderate O2/N2 selectivity. Nevertheless,
PIM-1 membrane separation performance is still limited by the trade-off
relationship between permeability and selectivity.4,5 Mixed
matrix membranes (MMMs) afford the opportunity to break the performance
limitation by adding the filler to PIM-1.6,7 With
different metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) introduced into PIM-1,
the corresponding MMMs have shown excellent gas separation performance.8−10 Particularly, the MMM based on
PIM-1 and zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8), the O2 and N2 permeability were increased by 190 and 94%, respectively;
meanwhile, the O2/N2 selectivity was increased
by 50%.11 However, the poor compatibility
between polymer substrates and MOF particles usually leads to nonuniform
distribution of particles, especially for MMMs with high filler loading,
and it may cause agglomeration and poor mechanical properties.12−14 Such a defective polymer–filler
interface induces nonselective voids, which will affect gas separation
performance.

Recently, a new strategy to improve the polymer–filler
interface by growing MOF particles on membranes has been reported.15−17 Growing ZIF-8 particles on the
surface of membranes has exhibited potential application in gas separation.
Téllez et al. crystallized a thick continuous ZIF-8 membrane
on highly porous flexible polysulfone, and the ZIF-8/polysulfone composite
membrane showed a high H2 separation performance.18 Wang et al. deposited an ultrathin ZIF-8 membrane
on bromomethylated poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene oxide) (BPPO) after
being modified with ethylene diamine, and the resulting ZIF-8/ED-modified
BPPO composite membrane exhibited a significantly high H2 permeability.19 Jansen and Budd et al.
reported that growing ZIF-8 particles on the PIM-1 membrane in water
could enhance O2/N2 selectivity. However, the
O2/N2 separation performance could not exceed
the Robeson upper bound line because of the low O2 permeability.20

In this work, we aimed to improve the
performance of the composite membrane in O2/N2 separation. Because the methanol-treated PIM-1 membrane often results
in a significant increase in permeability,21 we proposed using methanol as the solvent for the preparation of
the PIM-1/ZIF-8 composite membrane will improve the O2/N2 separation performance. By growing ZIF-8 nanoparticles on
one side of the PIM-1 membrane, a series of PIM-1/ZIF-8-X composite membranes were fabricated in methanol. Their structures,
morphologies, and interactions of the composite membranes were characterized
by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermo-gravimetric
analysis (TGA), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method,
and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). O2 and N2 permeation properties of the resultant composite membranes were
measured using a constant-volume/variable pressure method.

Results and Discussion
FT-IR, TGA, and BET
FT-IR spectra of ZIF-8, PIM-1 membrane,
and PIM-1/ZIF-8-X composite membranes are shown in Figure 1. The FT-IR spectrum
of the PIM-1 membrane was identical to that reported in the literature.22 The absorption bands at 2860, 2930, and 2960
cm–1 correspond to the stretching vibrations of
−CH3 groups. The absorption band at 2240 cm–1 is assigned to the stretching vibrations of −CN
groups. The absorption band at 1600 cm–1 is attributed
to the stretching vibrations of −C=C– bonds.
Compared with the ZIF-8 and PIM-1 membrane, no new peak is found in
PIM-1/ZIF-8-X composite membranes, indicating that
there is no strong chemical interaction between ZIF-8 particles and
PIM-1 chains.

Figure 1 FT-IR spectra of ZIF-8, PIM-1 membrane, and
PIM-1/ZIF-8-X composite membranes.

Thermal properties of the PIM-1 membrane and PIM-1/ZIF-8-X composite membranes were evaluated by TGA. As shown in Figure 2, the PIM-1 membrane
exhibited high thermal stability and a single-step decomposition at
about 480 °C. Thermal analysis of PIM-1/ZIF-8-X composite membranes indicated that ZIF-8 particles have no effect
on their thermal stability, thus, PIM-1/ZIF-8-X composite
membranes demonstrated excellent thermal stability as the PIM-1 membrane.
The TGA curves also showed that the amount of ZIF-8 grew on the PIM-1
membrane could be increased by the repeating growth cycle. Meanwhile,
there was no obvious weight loss over the temperature range of 50–200
°C for all the membranes, indicating that no residual solvent
was trapped in their pores, which will affect the permeation properties
of the membranes.

Figure 2 TGA of PIM-1
and PIM-1/ZIF-8-X composite membranes.

As shown in the nitrogen adsorption–desorption
isotherms (Supporting Information, Figure
S3), both the PIM-1 membrane and the PIM-1/ZIF-8-7 composite membrane
exhibited type I isotherm, indicating most of the pores in these membranes
are micropores.23 Compared with the surface
area of the PIM-1 membrane (616 m2/g), the PIM/ZIF-8-7
composite membrane has a larger surface area (811 m2/g),
which is distinctly higher than the surface area of most porous polymer
networks.24 To further investigate the
microporous structure of the PIM/ZIF-8-7 composite membrane, pore
size distributions were calculated by using the density function theory
method. In the PIM/ZIF-8-7 composite membrane, high pore volume proportion
was observed for pores smaller than 2.5 nm, indicating that the membrane
comprises significant amount of micropores. However, we found that
there are obvious signals in the range of 2.5–10 nm, suggesting
the existence of some mesopores. Figure 3 showed that the average pore diameter of
the PIM-1/ZIF-8-7 composite membrane is about 2.1 nm, which demonstrates
the decreased porosity size of the composite membrane with respect
to the PIM-1 membrane (2.8 nm).

Morphologies
of PIM-1/ZIF-8-X Composite Membranes
The
SEM images of the PIM-1 membrane and PIM/ZIF-8-X composite
membranes are displayed in Figure 4. The SEM images showed ZIF-8 nanoparticles adhere
well to the PIM-1 membrane, which can be attributed to the attraction
between the PIM-1 membrane and the ZIF-8 particles. Ramsahye et al.
reported that there is a preferential interaction between −CN
groups (in PIM-1) and the −NH– groups (in ZIF-8).25 Small particles were observed on the PIM-1/ZIF-8-2
composite membrane, corresponding to the nucleation stage of ZIF-8
crystallization. By repeating the growth cycle, a ZIF-8 nano-particle
layer was eventually formed on the PIM-1 membrane. The particle size
distributions of the PIM-1/ZIF-8-7 composite membrane estimated from
the SEM images are shown in Supporting Information Figure S4.

composite membrane, (e) PIM-1/ZIF-8-7 composite membrane, (f) PIM-1/ZIF-8-8
composite membrane.

The cross section of the PIM-1/ZIF-8-7 composite
membrane revealed that the ZIF-8 nano-particle layer is composed of
intergrown crystals, which adhere to the surface of the PIM-1 membrane.
The nanoparticle layer has a thickness of about 200 nm (Figure 5). No evident interface between
the ZIF-8 nanoparticle layer and the PIM-1 membrane was observed,
confirming that ZIF-8 adheres well on the PIM-1 membrane. Because
only one side of the PIM-1 membrane was exposed to the ZIF-8 precursor
solution, ZIF-8 nano-particles were selectively grown on one side
of the PIM-1 membrane, resulting in a pizza-like composite membrane.

Gas Permeation Properties
The
performance of the PIM-1 membrane and PIM-1/ZIF-8-X composite membranes in terms of pure-gas permeabilities of O2 and N2 are summarized in Table 1. Ultrahigh free-volume glassy polymer has
weak size-sieving ability, and the selectivity is usually dominated
by solubility selectivity.26 The PIM-1
membrane displays a high oxygen solubility coefficient, a medium solubility
selectivity, and a very low diffusivity selectivity. The PIM-1 membrane
prepared in this work has an O2 permeability of 1808 Barrer
and a N2 permeability of 702 Barrer, which are similar
to the value reported by Guiver.27

As shown in Table 2, the PIM-1/ZIF-8-2 composite membrane exhibited slight decrease
in the solubility coefficient for both O2 and N2, probably attributing to the addition of a small number of nucleation
state ZIF-8 particles. Because the PIM-1 membrane has a microporous
structure, ZIF-8 nanoparticles may be grown into some of the pores,
resulting in a decrease of free volume in PIM-1. However, the addition
of the nucleation state of ZIF-8 particles reduced the pore size of
the PIM-1/ZIF-8-2 composite membrane, which induced an increase in
O2/N2 diffusivity selectivity, making the PIM-1/ZIF-8-2
composite membrane to be slightly increased in O2/N2 selectivity.

Compared with gas permeation properties
of the PIM-1 membrane, PIM-1/ZIF-8-4 and PIM-1/ZIF-8-6 composite membranes
showed increase in O2/N2 selectivity. However,
PIM-1/ZIF-8-4 and PIM-1/ZIF-8-6 composite membranes exhibited decrease
in O2/N2 diffusivity selectivity. These could
be explained by the further addition of ZIF-8 particles, which blocked
up more cavities of the PIM-1 membrane, leading to reduced selective
voids, and decreased sorption sites for O2 and N2. Robeson et al. reported that the solubility selectivity of A/B
gas pair decreases with increasing of free volume when the A gas is
larger in size than the B gas.28 It means
that sorption sites are less available to larger gas molecules as
the free volume decreases. Therefore, the solubility selectivity for
O2/N2 increased as free volume decreased.

As shown in Table 2, N2 solubility coefficients of PIM-1/ZIF-8-4 and PIM-1/ZIF-8-6
composite membranes were decreased; however, there was no significant
decrease in O2 solubility coefficients compared with that
of the PIM-1 membrane. The kinetic diameters of O2 and
N2 are 3.46 and 3.64 Å, respectively, which makes
it very difficult to separate O2 or N2 from
air by simple micropore-based sieving effects. Freeman reported that
improving the solubility selectivity could perform beyond the Robeson
upper-bound line.29 Therefore, the increases
in O2/N2 selectivity of PIM-1/ZIF-8-4 and PIM-1/ZIF-8-6
composite membranes may be mainly attributed to the increases of solubility
selectivity.

Regarding the PIM-1/ZIF-8-7 composite membrane,
both diffusivity selectivity and solubility selectivity of O2/N2 were increased, resulting in an increase in the selectivity.
The increases of diffusivity selectivity for O2/N2 may be attributed to the reduction in the average pore size, finally
leading to a higher O2/N2 selectivity. The PIM-1/ZIF-8-7
composite membrane has an O2/N2 selectivity
of 3.7 with an O2 permeability of 1287 Barrer.

For
all PIM-1/ZIF-8-X composite membranes, the diffusivity
coefficients of O2 and N2 are almost similar
to that of the PIM-1 membrane. The slight decreases in permeability
of all PIM-1/ZIF-8-X composite membranes are mainly
due to the reduction of free volume. Additional growth cycle could
not always enhance selectivity of the composite membrane. Compared
with the PIM-1/ZIF-8-7 composite membrane, the PIM-1/ZIF-8-8 composite
membrane exhibited an obvious decrease in O2/N2 selectivity. The decrease of selectivity may be attributed to further
growth of ZIF-8, which makes the composite membrane more size-selective.

Because the main objective of this work was to prepare high permeation
membranes with enhanced selectivity, Figure 6 demonstrated the comparison between PIM-1/ZIF-8-X composite membranes and recently reported composite membranes.
The O2 permeabilities of PIM-1/ZIF-8-X composite membranes are much higher than those of in the relevant
literature.19 Moreover, the O2/N2 separation performance of ZIF-8/PIM-1-7 successfully
exceeded the Robeson upper bound line.5

Conclusions
In this
work, pizza-like composite membranes (PIM-1/ZIF-8-X) were prepared by growing ZIF-8 nano-particles on one side of the
PIM-1 membrane. The resulting composite membranes have excellent thermal
stability, large surface area, and microporous structures. Meanwhile,
the ZIF-8 nanoparticles show good adhesion with the PIM-1 membrane.
The composite membranes not only eliminate the polymer–filler
interface voids but also exhibit high permeability for O2. The gas permeation properties of the composite membranes indicate
that a proper ZIF-8 growth time could improve the O2/N2 separation performance. The PIM-1/ZIF-8-7 composite membrane
has an O2/N2 selectivity of 3.7, with an O2 permeability of 1287 Barrer. The separation performance of
the PIM-1/ZIF-8-7 composite membrane successfully exceeds the Robeson
upper bound line, indicating that the PIM-1/ZIF-8-7 composite membrane
has excellent separation performance.

Experimental Section
Materials
All the reagents were purchased commercially. 5,5′,6,6′-Tetrahydroxy-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethyl-1,1′-spirobisindance
(TTSBI) and 1,4-dicyanotetrafluo-robenzene (DCTB) need further purification
before use. TTSBI was recrystallized in methanol with the white powder
collected by filtration and dried under vacuum at 60 °C for 48
h. DCTB was purified by vacuum sublimation at 145 °C. Both TTSBI
and DCTB were kept in a desiccator for storage. All the solvents were
dried with standard procedures and stored under nitrogen.

Synthesis of PIM-1
PIM-1 was synthesized
by following the reported method.30 In
a dry three-necked flask equipped with a Dean–Stark trap, TTSBI
(10.2 g, 30.0 mmol) and DCTB (6.0 g, 30.0 mmol) were dissolved in
DMAc (100.0 mL), and then, anhydrous K2CO3 (8.3
g, 60 mmol) was added. Air was removed from the flask four times by
application of gentle vacuum and replacement with N2. The
flask was moved to an oil bath preheated at 155 °C. Toluene (40
mL) was added when the solution became viscous after 2 min of stirring.
The reaction was continued for 60 min and then the product was poured
into methanol. The collected crude polymer was dissolved in chloroform
and re-precipitated from methanol. The obtained polymer was refluxed
for 6 h in deionized water and then dried under vacuum at 100 °C
for 2 days, and the PIM-1 powder (13.2 g, yield = 85%) was kept in
a desiccator for further analysis. As shown in Supporting Information Figure S1, 1H NMR of PIM-1
powder was identical to that reported in the literature.27 Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis
results of PIM-1 powder are shown in Supporting Information Figure S2 and Table S1, Mw = 21.9 kg/mol, Mn = 90.4 kg/mol, Mw/Mn = 2.4 compared
with polystyrene standards.

Fabrication
of the PIM-1 Membrane
The PIM-1 membrane was prepared by
casting 2 wt % PIM-1/chloroform solution onto a flat-bottomed glass
Petri dish. The solvent was then allowed to evaporate slowly in order
to form the membrane. The membrane was left for 2 days to complete
solvent evaporation. Thereafter, the membrane was transferred to a
vacuum oven and dried at 70 °C for 48 h to remove any residual
solvent.

Fabrication of PIM-1/ZIF-8
Composite Membranes
The PIM-1 membrane was cut into a circular
piece (approximately 2.8 cm in diameter, 70 μm thickness). It
was fixed on the bottom, in a vial containing a mixture of two solutions,
2-methylimidazole (1.65 g, 20.1 mmol) in methanol (30 mL) and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.75 g, 2.37 mmol) in
methanol (30 mL). The ZIF-8 growth solution was stirred (500 rpm)
at ambient temperature. After 12 h, the membrane was removed from
the vial and washed three times with methanol. To increase the amount
of ZIF-8 crystallized on the PIM-1 membrane, the above growing process
was repeated with freshly mixed solution of 2-methylimidazole and
Zn(NO3)2·6H2O. The desired membrane
(PIM-1/ZIF-8-X, X means growth cycle)
was dried under vacuum at 70 °C for 24 h.

Characterization Techniques
1H NMR spectra
were recorded on a Bruker AV400 spectrometer, and chemical shifts
were reported in ppm relative to a tetramethylsilane standard. The
chemical bonds were investigated using a FT-IR spectrometer (Nicolet
Magna-IR 750) at a scanning range from 4000 to 400 cm–1. The thermal degradation of the PIM-1 membrane and PIM-1/ZIF-8-X composite membranes were monitored by using a TA instrument
with a 2050 thermo-gravimetric analyzer. The analyses were carried
out with a rate of 10 °C/min at temperatures ranging from 50
to 800 °C, N2 was used as the purge gas and its flow
rate was controlled at 50 mL/min. The BET surface area of membranes
was measured with a Micro ASAP 2460 and the samples were degassed
by heating at 120 °C. The surface morphologies of membrane samples
were observed by a field emission SEM (Gemini SEM-500, Germany). Cross
sections of membrane samples were fractured in liquid nitrogen and
coated with platinum via sputtering before analysis.

Gas Permeation Measurements
The pure-gas
permeabilities of O2 and N2 were measured by
using a constant-volume/variable-pressure method at 35 °C. The
membranes were degassed under vacuum at 80 °C overnight to remove
dissolved gases and moisture. The results reported here are the average
of three measurements. After degassing the whole apparatus, the membrane
was mounted in a permeation cell. Then, permeate gas was introduced
on the upstream side (with ZIF-8 nano-particles), and the permeate
pressure on the downstream side (without ZIF-8 nano-particles) was
monitored by using a MKS-Baratron pressure transducer.

Pure-gas
permeability is determined by  where P is the permeability (Barrer) (1 Barrer = 10–10 cm3(STP) cm/cm2 s cmHg), A is the effective membrane area (cm2), V is the downstream volume (cm3), R is
the universal gas constant (6236.56 cm3 cmHg/mol K), T is the absolute temperature (K), L is
the membrane thickness (cm), p is the upstream pressure
(cmHg), and dp/dt is the permeation
rate (cmHg/s).

The ideal selectivity for the O2/N2 gas pair is determined by  

The diffusion
coefficient D (cm2/s) is obtained by  where L is the membrane thickness (cm) and θ
is the time lag of the permeability measurement (s).

The solubility
coefficient S [cm3(STP)/(cm3 cmHg)] is calculated by
