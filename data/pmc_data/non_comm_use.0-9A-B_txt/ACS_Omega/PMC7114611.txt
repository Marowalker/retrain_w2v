The
present study demonstrates how the different states of solubilized
water viz. quaternary ammonium headgroup-bound, bulklike, counterion-bound,
and free water in reverse micelles of a series of cationic gemini
surfactants, water/12-s-12 (s =
5, 6, 8).2Br–/n-propanol/cyclohexane,
control the solvation dynamics and rotational relaxation of Coumarin
490 (C-490) and microenvironment of the reverse micelles. The relative
number of solubilized water molecules of a given state per surfactant
molecule decides major and minor components. A rapid increase in the
number of bulklike water molecules per surfactant molecule as compared
to the slow increase in the number of each of headgroup- and counterion-bound
water molecules per surfactant molecule with increasing water content
(Wo) in a given reverse micellar system
is responsible for the increase in the rate of solvation and rotational
relaxation of C-490. The increase in the number of counterion-bound
water molecules per surfactant molecule and the concomitant decrease
in the number of bulklike water molecules per surfactant molecule
with increasing spacer chain length of gemini surfactants at a given Wo are ascribed to the slower rates of both solvation
and rotational relaxation. Relative abundances of different states
of water have a role on the microenvironment of the reverse micelles
as well. Thus, a comprehensive effect of different states of water
on dynamics in complex biomimicking systems has been presented here.

1 Introduction
Surfactant
molecules can self-assemble to form various organized
assemblies such as vesicles, reverse micelles, micelles, and so forth,
which can mimic biological systems.1 Reverse
micelles are one of the simplest systems which can mimic the membrane
architecture.2 The interior of the reverse
micelle which comprises the polar or charged headgroups and counterions
can readily hold water or other polar solvents such as methanol, acetonitrile,
dimethylformamide, and so forth.3−5Wo is the molar ratio of the polar solvent to the surfactant ([polar
solvent]/[surfactant]) and controls the size of the reverse micelles.
If the pool contains water, it is known as the “water pool.”2 The water molecules present in the reverse micelles
are highly structured but heterogeneous.6 The water molecules entrapped in the pool of the reverse micelles
behave similarly to the water molecules evident at the interface of
the proteins or in the biological membranes.7 In biological systems, some water molecules, called bound water,
are directly bound to the interface of biomolecules such as proteins
and spend a longer time in their vicinity. However, some water molecules
experience a very fast rotational and translational diffusion as compared
to the former and are usually referred to as free water.8 There is a dynamic exchange between these two
types of water.8,9 The hydrogen bonding interactions
among water molecules and with several proton donating or proton accepting
groups of biomolecules form a continuous hydrogen bonded path with
a well-defined structure in the hydration layer, which boosts the
proton transfer along the macromolecular chain.10 Thus, reverse micelles as biomimicking molecular assemblies
with different types of water molecules present within them provide
a great opportunity to investigate the dynamics of molecules with
various degrees of hydration.11 Techniques
such as small-angle neutron scattering,12,13 Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR),14,15 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR),10,16−18 dielectric relaxation,19,20 and solvation
dynamics9,21−29 have been utilized to understand the properties of water in many
molecular assemblies. However, solvation dynamics has the edge over
the other techniques in terms of both spatial and temporal resolution.9 Most interestingly, the ultraslow component of
water, which is slower by many orders of the magnitude of the bulk
water, has also been observed with the help of solvation dynamics
in a confined environment.20 The bulk water
exhibits very fast solvation dynamics.30 Barbara et al.31 found the biexponential
nature of solvation dynamics in water with two components, 0.16 and
1.2 ps. Fleming et al.32 also reported
the biexponential decay with components, 126 and 880 fs.

The
solvation dynamics studied in several biomimicking systems33−35 is found to be dependent on the structures of the molecular assemblies.36−49 Bhattacharya and group50 investigated
the solvation dynamics in the reverse micelles of Aerosol OT (AOT)
using Coumarin 480 (C-480) as the fluorescent probe molecule and observed
faster solvation with increasing water content, suggesting that the
mobility of the water molecules in the water pool increased with increasing Wo. In contrast, Hazra et al.51 observed that the solvation dynamics was almost insensitive
to the water loading in the microemulsions of sodium dodecyl sulfate
(SDS), TX-100, and cetyltrimethylammonium Bromide (CTAB) as the probe,
C-480, was located in the interfacial region.

Gemini surfactant,
a special kind of surfactant, has two monomeric
surfactant units chemically bonded to each other at the headgroups
by a spacer group showing much superior properties than their conventional
counterparts.52,53 The chemical nature of the spacer
group of the gemini surfactant has a vital role in controlling its
physical properties such as critical micelle concentration (cmc),
counterion binding, aggregation number, and so forth.54−61 Saha and co-workers62,63 investigated the effects of the
chemical nature of the spacer group on the solvation dynamics and
rotational relaxation processes in aqueous micelles by varying the
number of hydroxyl group substitution and the number of −CH2– units in the spacer group. It was seen that the solvation
time increased with increasing the hydroxyl group substitution in
the spacer group.62 The average solvation
time was found to be increased with increasing the number of methylene
units in the spacer group.63

Recently,
Saha and group64 reported
the solvation dynamics and rotational relaxations of Coumarin 490
(C-490) in the aqueous reverse micelles of the gemini surfactant,
12-4-12.2Br–. The rates of solvation and rotational
relaxation processes were found to be increased with increasing Wo as more C-490 molecules moved toward the interior
of water pool and experienced a more flexible environment around them.
Moreover, the solvation time in the reverse micelles of cationic gemini
surfactants was found to be faster than that observed in the reverse
micelles of AOT using the same probe.65 The AOT surfactant having oxygen atoms in the headgroup possesses
a strong hydrogen bonding with water molecules, which is responsible
for slow solvation dynamics observed in its reverse micelles.

Zhao and group66 studied the effects
of the spacer chain length on the aggregation properties and cmc of
gemini surfactants, C12-s-C12 in n-heptanol/n-hexane solution.
They found the results similar to what Zana and group67 had observed. The cmc of reverse micelles is directly proportional
to the spacer chain length up to s = 4 and decreases
with further increment in s.68 The spacer stretches itself for a shorter length, but for longer
lengths (s > 6), it prefers to bend toward the
hydrophobic
phase in order to pack the quaternary ammonium headgroups as close
as possible on the surface, while maintaining an equilibrium distance
between the headgroups. Zhao’s group also investigated the
different states of the water using FT-IR spectroscopy within the
same reverse micelles.69 The OH-stretching
band was assigned to four species of water: quaternary ammonium headgroup-bound,
bulklike, counterion-bound, and free water species. There is a sharp
increase in the number of bulklike water molecules, but a small increase
in the number of headgroup-bound water molecules per surfactant molecule
with increasing Wo. It is also reported
that the water pool size reduces with an increase in the spacer chain
length at a fixed amount of water.70 This
is due to the effect in the molecular geometry because of the increased
size of the headgroup with s. The number of bulklike
water molecules per surfactant molecules decreases with increasing s. However, with a decrease in the size of the water pool
with increasing s, the interfacial curvature increases,
which restricts the hydration of the headgroup. As a result, the headgroup-bound
water molecules remain unchanged. The number of counterion-bound water
molecules per surfactant molecule increases with an increase in the
spacer chain length, corresponding to an increased degree of counterion
dissociation, as reported by Zana et al.71,72

Looking into the relationships between the number of water
molecules
of different states and water loading (Wo) in the reverse micelles and the spacer chain length at a given
water loading, the present work is focused on to see how these relationships
control the rates of solvation and rotational relaxation of C-490
(Scheme 1). A study
has been carried out in the reverse micelles of gemini surfactants,
water/12-s-12.2Br–/n-propanol/cyclohexane with varying spacer groups (s = 5, 6, 8) (Scheme 1) with different water loadings (Wo)
in each case. It is known that the aggregates with Wo < 15 are called reverse micelles and those with Wo > 15 are designated as microemulsions.73 In this work, although Wo varies from 2 to 25, for our convenience, all aggregates
would be called as reverse micelles only. The sharp rise in the number
of bulklike water molecules as compared to a small increase in headgroup-
and counterion-bound water molecules per surfactant molecule with
increasing Wo controls the microenvironment
around C-490 and also the rates of solvation and rotational relaxation.
At a given water loading, the relative abundance of bulklike water
molecules is mostly more than that of the headgroup- and counterion-bound
water molecules per surfactant molecule because of which the fast
component is the major component for solvation. The rate of rotational
relaxation process is increased with increasing Wo because of the gradual swelling of reverse micelles.
At a given Wo, with increasing spacer
chain length, the average solvation time is increased because of the
gradual increase in the number of counterion-bound water molecules
and the concomitant decrease in the number of bulklike water molecules
per surfactant molecule. Because of the fact that the size of the
water pool is reduced with an increase in the spacer chain length
at a given Wo, the average rotational
relaxation time of C-490 is gradually increased. Because the reverse
micelles behave as biomimicking systems and water molecules control
various biological processes, the study of comprehensive effects of
different states of solubilized water in the reverse micelles on the
solvation dynamics and rotational relaxation processes and the role
of the spacer chain length of gemini surfactants on relative abundances
of various states of water thereby affecting the dynamics have practical
and fundamental importance.

2.2 UV–Visible Absorption and Steady-State
Fluorescence Spectra
UV–Visible absorption spectra
of C-490 have been recorded in the reverse micellar media of 12-5-12,
12-6-12, and 12-8-12 with varying Wo and
also in pure solvents such as water, n-propanol,
and the bulk solvent [cyclohexane plus 10% n-propanol
(CYH + prop)]. Figure 2 displays the absorption spectra of C-490 in various solvents and
reverse micelles of 12-5-12 with varying Wo as a representative. Similar absorption spectra are obtained for
reverse micellar systems of the other two gemini surfactants as well.
The peak maxima of absorption bands of C-490 have been tabulated in Table 1. C-490 has a broad
absorption peak at 366 nm in pure water. The peak maximum of C-490
appears at 373 nm in the bulk solvent and 383 nm in pure n-propanol. The steady-state fluorescence spectra of C-490 have been
recorded for all the systems mentioned above. Figure 3a represents steady-state fluorescence spectra
in various solvents and reverse micelles of 12-5-12 with varying Wo excited at 340 nm as a representative. In
bulk solvent (CYH + prop), the fluorescence peak maximum appears at
467 nm, while in n-propanol, the peak maximum is
observed at 476 nm. The fluorescence band, when recorded in water,
undergoes a bathochromic shift to 491 nm as compared to bulk solvent
and n-propanol. The steady-state fluorescence spectra
of C-490 excited at 375 and 412 nm have also been recorded for all
the systems to see any effect of excitation wavelength on peak positions
and intensities and are given in Figures 3b and S1, respectively.
The normalized fluorescence spectra along with the normalized absorption
spectra are provided in Figure 4 to have a better picture of the effect of static polarity
of solvents and water content (Wo) in
reverse micelles on peak positions of the bands. All fluorescence
peak maxima data have been tabulated in Table 1, and the values of full width at half-maximum
(FWHM) for fluorescence bands of C-490 in different reverse micellar
systems at various excitation wavelengths are given in Table S2.

The fluorescence excitation spectra
of C-490 have also been recorded
in the reverse micelles. Figure 5 displays the excitation spectra in the reverse micelles
of 12-8-12 at Wo = 25 monitored at two
different emission wavelengths, 435 and 550 nm. The excitation spectrum
monitored at 435 nm was compared with the UV–visible absorption
spectrum of C-490 in the bulk solvent, while the one monitored at
550 nm was compared with the absorption spectrum of C-490 in the reverse
micelles at Wo = 25.

Figure 5 2.3 Excited
State Lifetime
Excited singlet-state
lifetime values of C-490 in various solvents and reverse micelles
of all the gemini surfactants have been determined using the TSCPC
method. Fluorescence decays in all selected solvents are found to
be monoexponential. All the decays for the reverse micellar systems
were fitted biexponentially. The average lifetime (⟨τf⟩) has been calculated using eq 1, as given later. The average lifetimes of
C-490 in all the reverse micellar systems and pure solvents have been
tabulated in Table S3. Figure 6 represents a comparison of
the average lifetime of C-490 in reverse micelles of different surfactants
at varying Wo. ⟨τf⟩ decreases with increasing Wo for reverse micelles of a given surfactant, whereas
it enhances with an increase in the spacer chain length of gemini
surfactants at a given Wo.

lifetime of C-490 in reverse micelles of
different surfactants at varying Wo. λexc = 375 nm.

2.4 Solvation
Dynamics
To study the solvation
dynamics in a particular reverse micelle, the fluorescence decays
of C-490, excited at 375 nm, were monitored at different emission
wavelengths in the entire range of the fluorescence emission spectrum.
The representative fluorescence decays of C-490 in reverse micelles
of 12-5-12 at Wo = 2, along with the corresponding
residuals for every decay, are shown in Figure 7.

micelles of 12-5-12
at Wo = 2 at IRF, 415, 445, 475, and 580
nm and corresponding residual (lower panels) for each decay. λexc = 375 nm.

Time-Resolved Emission
Spectra (TRES) have been constructed using
the method given by Fleming and Maroncelli74 for reverse micellar systems of all three gemini surfactants at
different Wo. TRES plots of C-490 in reverse
micelles of all three gemini surfactants at Wo = 10 have been shown in Figure 8 as a representative. The solvent correlation
function (SCF), C(t) (eq 2), explained by Fleming and Maroncelli
has been calculated utilizing TRES and has been used to study the
dynamics of the solvation.74 The decays
of C(t) for reverse micellar systems
of a particular surfactant for varying Wo are shown in Figure 9. The decay characteristics of C(t) obtained after biexponential fitting (eq 3) of decay curves along with the average solvation
time, ⟨τs⟩, calculated using eq 4, are tabulated in Table 2. The error bars associated
with the biexponential fitting of C(t) decays are given in Table 2. Decay characteristics in n-propanol and
bulk solvent are also given in Table 2. Figure 10 displays the comparison of ⟨τs⟩
with respect to the water pool size of the reverse micelles and the
spacer chain length of the gemini surfactants.

2.5 Rotational Relaxation
The time-resolved
fluorescence anisotropy (r(t)) measurements
were performed to know more about the microenvironment of C-490 in
the reverse micelles. The rotational relaxations of the probe residing
in an organized assembly can be known by the time-resolved fluorescence
anisotropy measurements. The r(t) of C-490 has been calculated using eq 5, monitoring fluorescence emission at 470 nm. The anisotropy
decays in reverse micelles of each of the three gemini surfactants
with varying Wo have been shown in Figure 11. The anisotropy
decays in all the reverse micellar systems have been fitted biexponentially
using eq 6. The average
rotational relaxation times, ⟨τr⟩ ,
for all the systems have been determined by using eq 7.

Figure 11 Time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy
decay of C-490 in reverse
micelles of (a) 12-5-12, (b) 12-6-12, and (c) 12-8-12 at Wo = 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25; λexc =
375 nm and λem = 470 nm.

The fast and slow rotational relaxation times, along with the corresponding
relative amplitudes and average rotational relaxation times, have
been tabulated in Table 3. The rotational relaxation times have also been measured in n-propanol and bulk solvent, and the data are included in Table 3. As reported in the
literature,75 the error bars associated
with the rotational relaxation times are found to be high in the present
study as well. The dependence of ⟨τr⟩
of C-490 on Wo and spacer chain length
has been shown in Figure 12.

2.6 Different
States of Water Solubilized in Reverse
Micelles: FT-IR Studies
In order to quantify different states
of solubilized water in reverse micelles, the FT-IR band was recorded
for O–H stretch in each of the reverse micellar systems [Figure S2a–c] and was deconvoluted by
a Gaussian program, PRESENTS, on the basis of second derivative. Four
sub-bands are obtained for each FT-IR spectrum after curve fitting.
As a representative, Figure 13 shows the deconvolution result for the O–H stretching
band of water in the reverse micelles of 12-5-12 at Wo = 20. For each FT-IR band, the fitting with the experimental
line was very good with the correlation coefficient value close to
∼0.999.

micelles at Wo = 20 for 12-5-12 where
(i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) represent the O–H stretching modes
of quaternary ammonium headgroup-bound, bulklike, counterion Br– bound, and free water species, respectively.

After getting sub-bands corresponding to four different
states
of water, the fractions of area (Fi) for
each state of water with varying Wo in
the reverse micelles of a particular gemini surfactant have been calculated
and plotted in Figure S3a–c. Using Fi value, the average number of water molecules
of each state per surfactant molecule is then calculated (see Note
1 in Supporting Information)69,76,77 and plotted in Figure 14 for different Wo. Figure 15a represents the changes in the area fraction of each state of water
with an increase in the spacer chain length, and Figure 15b represents the change in
the average number of water molecules of each state of water with
an increase in the spacer chain length at Wo = 20 as representatives.

3 Discussion
The absorption
peak maximum of C-490 in pure water is blue-shifted
by 17 nm with respect to that in n-propanol. The
water being highly polar, the blue shift in this solvent with respect
to n-propanol is owed to the intermolecular hydrogen
bonding interactions between water molecules and C-490 which is a
common phenomenon for intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) type of
molecules.78−81 The fluorescence peak maxima of C-490 in n-propanol
and water are red-shifted by 9 and 24 nm, respectively, with respect
to that in the bulk solvent. This is due to greater stabilization
of the excited state by a more polar solvent. Absorption and fluorescence
bands of C-490 in reverse micelle at Wo = 2 get red-shifted by 10 and 6 nm (λexc = 375
nm), respectively, with respect to that in the bulk solvent (Figure 2–4). It implies that C-490 molecules reside inside
the reverse micelles. Absorption and fluorescence peak maxima of C-490
in pure water are 366 and 491 nm, respectively. However, these peak
maxima are located at 381 and 477 nm in reverse micelles of 12-5-12
at Wo = 25. Peak maxima values close to
these are noted in the case of reverse micelles of other gemini surfactants
as well. These results infer that the static polarity of the microenvironment
around C-490 inside the reverse micelles is significantly different
from that in bulk solvent and bulk water. Normalized spectra in Figure 4 show that with increasing
loading of water in the reverse micelles, there is a progressive blue
shift in the absorption band and a progressive red shift in the fluorescence
band. These results depict that the microenvironment inside the reverse
micelles becomes more polar with the increasing content of solubilized
water in the pool. The red shift in the fluorescence band noticed
for reverse micelles is similar to that observed in n-propanol. Thus, polarity-wise, the microenvironment is similar to
that of alcohol. Similar polarity of reverse micellar systems has
been described in the literature.51,82 The dependence
of absorption and fluorescence peak positions of C-490 on the spacer
chain length of gemini surfactants is found to be insignificant.

In this study, several experiments have been carried out to check
the microheterogeneity of the environment around C-490 molecules in
the reverse micelles. The excitation spectrum recorded for C-490 in
reverse micelles (Figure 5 is for 12-8-12 at Wo = 25) at
λem = 435 nm almost bears a resemblance to the absorption
spectrum of C-490 in bulk solvent; however, the excitation spectrum
measured at 550 nm resembles the absorption spectrum of C-490 in the
reverse micelles at Wo = 25. These observations
indicate that C-490 molecules are partitioned into different environments
of the reverse micelles.1,51,59,60,64 The fluorescence spectra of C-490 in the reverse micelles recorded
at λex = 375 and 412 nm are found to be red-shifted
by 2–3 nm as compared to excitation at 340 nm. FWHM of the
fluorescence band increases upon increase in the excitation wavelength.
Differences are also noted in terms of changes in intensities. While
fluorescence intensity increases with increasing Wo and then moves towards a spectrum with similar intensity
in n-propanol as solvent upon excitation at 340 nm
(Figure 3a), the fluorescence
intensity decreases when excited at 375 nm (Figure 3b) or at 412 nm (Figure S1). It could be because of the increase in the population
of a species at 340 nm and the decrease in the population of the same
species at a longer wavelength with increasing Wo. As mentioned above, the absorption bands in reverse micelles
at Wo = 25 and in pure water are blue-shifted
as compared to the reverse micelles at Wo = 2. These results are also in support of the microheterogeneous
environment of C-490 in the reverse micelles.

Hydrodynamic diameter
values of reverse micelles of all the three
gemini surfactants at two representatives Wo (2 and 10) obtained from dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements
are displayed in Table 4. These data imply that the size of a given reverse micelle increases
with increasing loading of water and the size decreases with increment
in the spacer chain length at a given Wo. From FE-SEM images, shapes of all reverse micelles are found to
be spherical in nature (given Figure 1 is for 12-8-12 as a representative). The size of a
micelle found in FE-SEM images is different from that measured by
the DLS method. This difference is due to the two different methods
used. To check whether there is any effect of swelling of the reverse
micelles on the microenvironment of C-490, changes in absorption and
fluorescence peak positions, FWHM of fluorescence bands, and fluorescence
decay parameters at varying Wo of all
micelles have been analyzed. Normalized spectra given in Figure 4 show blue shift
in the absorption band and red shift in the fluorescence band with
increasing Wo. FWHM of fluorescence bands
has a decreasing trend with increasing Wo (Table S2). The fluorescence decays are
monoexponential in water, n-propanol, and bulk solvents;83 however, all the decays are found to be biexponential
in the reverse micellar systems (Table S3). It can be seen from the Figure 6 that the average lifetime of C-490 decreases with
an increase in water pool size. Data in Table S3 infer that although there is no significant change in the
lifetime of the slow component, there is a trend of decrease in the
lifetime of the fast component with increasing Wo. FT-IR data (Figure 14) show that while the average number of bulklike water per
surfactant molecule rapidly increases with increasing Wo, the rates of the increase in the number of each of
headgroup- and counterion-bound water are comparatively less. Thus,
the number of hydrogen-bonded water increases, and it is known that
the hydrogen-bonded water is more polar than the water bound to headgroup
or counterion.9,20 Therefore, the conversion of
an ICT to a TICT state, depending on the static polarity of the environment,
is facilitated by enhancement in the polarity of the system with increasing
water pool size.82,84−87 The TICT state gets more populated
with an increase in the polarity of the environment around the coumarin
molecule, which results in a red shift in the fluorescence band with
decreased fluorescence intensity upon excitation at a longer wavelength.
For C-490, the generation of the TICT state is the main nonradiative
pathway.64,65 The C-490 molecule with a primary amine
group on the 7th position participates in hydrogen bonding, which
also results in the stabilization of the excited state. All these
results indicate that inside the reverse micelles, C-490 molecules
are located in different microenvironments and they are most likely
interface and water pool. Also, C-490 molecules get progressively
transferred to a more polar environment, that is, in the water pool
with increasing Wo. Similar results are
reported by Hazra and Sarkar for their study with C-490 in AOT–heptane
reverse micelles.65 It has been discussed
below that the degree of counterion dissociation increases with increasing Wo. Hence, there is a possibility that the microenvironment
becomes more polar because of a progressive increase in the number
of counterions with increasing Wo. However,
counterions remain hydrogen-bonded with water. The abundance of bulklike
water is more than that of counterion-bound water. The number of bulklike
water increases more rapidly than that of counterion-bound water with
increasing Wo. Moreover, the bulklike
water is more polar than the counterion-bound water, and C-490 migrates
to the water pool from the interface with increasing pool size. Thus,
the increase in the polarity of the microenvironment with increasing
water loading is most likely due to the presence of more abundant
bulklike water.

As mentioned above, the size of water pool of the reverse micelle
decreases with an increase in the spacer chain length of the surfactants
at a given Wo. It can be seen from FT-IR
data (Figure 15) that
while there is a fall in the number of bulklike water per surfactant
molecule, the number of counterion-bound water rises with an increase
in the spacer chain length. It is evidenced by the increase in the
degree of counterion dissociation with an increase in the spacer chain
length (Figure 16).
On the other hand, the number of each of headgroup and free water
almost remains constant. Counterion-bond water is comparatively less
polar than the hydrogen-bonded water.9,20 It is thus
expected that the polarity of the microenvironment of C-490 would
decrease with increasing the chain length of the spacer. That is why
the average excited-state lifetime of C-490 becomes longer with an
increase in the spacer chain length of the gemini surfactants implied
by Figure 6. This result
indicates that the opposing effect of an increase in the polarity
due to the increasing number of dissociated counterions is subsided
by the effect of clustering of water.

of reverse micellar systems of the three
gemini surfactants with increasing Wo and
(b) variation of the average number of counterion-bound water molecules

Figure 7 shows that
a fluorescence decay at a short emission wavelength (e.g., 415 nm)
is very fast. Initially, the solvent dipoles are oriented randomly
around the solute dipoles created at the excited state and the energy
of the system is high. Ideally, the fast decay corresponds to the
fluorescence from these unsolvated dipoles. These unsolvated dipoles
do not undergo any relaxation process. Of course, because of the limitation
of our present time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) set-up
(IRF 165 ps), there would be significant contributions from the solvated
dipoles as well to the initial fast decay, which could not be detected.
The missing components have been analyzed by the method proposed by
Fee and Maroncelli,88 and the values obtained
have been tabulated in Table 2. The values of Δυ̅(=υ̅(0) –
υ̅(∞))are also given in Table 2. The missing component is found to be increasing,
and the Δυ̅ value is decreasing with increasing Wo in reverse micelles of a given surfactant
because of progressive increase in the number of bulklike water.49,50 However, a clear growth followed by a slow decay is observed when
the decay is recorded at a longer emission wavelength (e.g., 580 nm
in Figure 7). This
decay is explicitly from the solvated dipoles. The dipoles created
in the excited state first undergo a solvation process followed by
a fluorescence decay, which is delayed by the relaxation time9,89 and found to have a negative pre-exponential factor. Before measuring
solvation dynamics in all reverse micelles, the solvation time of
C-490 in the respective bulk solvents has been measured (Table 2). The solvation in
pure n-propanol is found to be single exponential
with a solvation time of ∼140 ps. However, the average solvation
time in bulk solvent (CHX + n-propanol) is ∼494
ps with a time constant of ∼257 ps (67%) and ∼959 ps
(33%). For a mixture of solvents of different polarities, preferential
solvation of the dipolar solute takes place in the solvation shell.
As a result, slower solvation occurs in mixed solvent as compared
to n-propanol.51,90 The data in Table 2 show that the solvation
dynamics of C-490 in reverse micelles has two solvation components,
fast and slow. For 12-5-12 at Wo = 2,
the average solvation time (⟨τs⟩) is
∼380 ps, with time constants for solvation being ∼943
ps (15%) and ∼281 ps (85%). For 12-6-12, the ⟨τs⟩ is ∼453 ps, with time constants for solvation
being ∼967 ps (29%) and ∼243 ps (71%). In case of 12-8-12,
the ⟨τs⟩ is ∼490 ps, with time
constants for solvation being ∼1150 ps (19%) and ∼336
ps (81%). However, at Wo = 25, the average
solvation times are reduced to ∼261, ∼288, and ∼306
ps for 12-5-12, 12-6-12, and 12-8-12, respectively. The corresponding
time constants for solvation are as follows: ∼ 965 ps (13%)
and ∼156 ps (87%); ∼841 ps (19%) and ∼158 ps
(81%); and ∼741 ps (32%) and ∼102 ps (68%). It is noteworthy
that the solvation dynamics in bulk water occurs in less than 1 ps
time scale.31,32 Thus, the results for present
reverse micelles imply that the water molecules present in the water
pool inside the reverse micelles are responsible for the solvation
of C-490. As mentioned above, the solvation dynamics of water is found
to be bimodal in nature. Bagchi and co-workers20,91 have proposed a multishell continuum model to describe the solvation
dynamics in protein and reverse micelles. Their model20 suggests that the fast and slow solvation components are
due to “free” and “bound” water molecules,
respectively, those are in dynamic exchange with each other. Apart
from water molecules, counterions, spacer group, and polar headgroups
of gemini surfactants may also contribute to solvation. However, the
polar headgroups of the surfactant molecule are attached to the hydrocarbon
tails, and the spacer group is connected to the tails through headgroups.
Thus, their mobility is constrained to a considerable extent as they
are connected to the long hydrocarbon tails, and it has been reported
that the polymer chain dynamics occurs on a very long time scale (∼100
ns).62,92,93 Therefore,
water molecules and counterions mostly contribute to solvation. It
can be seen from Figure 10 that for the reverse micellar system of each of the gemini
surfactants, the average solvation time decreases with increasing Wo. It is due to an increase in the number of
“free” water, as described in Bagchi and co-workers’
model.20

It is to be noted that the
solvation dynamics in the present reverse
micelles of gemini surfactants is found to be much faster than that
in the reverse micelles of CTAB, as reported by Hazra et al.51 There are two possible reasons for the same.
First, the solute molecule used by them is Coumarin 480 (C-480), which
is comparatively more hydrophobic than C-490 used in the present study.
C-480 is mostly located at the interface and reflects the dynamics,
which is a collective motion at the interface. That is why they did
not observe any significant effect of water loading on solvent relaxation
times. However, C-490 migrates from the interface to the water pool
with water loading as micelles swell. Second, it is the difference
between the size of reverse micelles of CTAB and gemini surfactants.
The diameter of the water pool of isooctane/CTAB/1-hexanol/water at Wo = 22.8 is 5.82 nm and that of dodecane/CTAB/1-hexanol/water
at Wo = 40.6 is 10.8 nm. However, DLS
data given in Table 4 show that the hydrodynamic diameter of gemini reverse micelles is
larger even at a comparatively lower Wo. Thus, the mobility of water molecules is expected to be relatively
faster in the reverse micelles of cationic gemini surfactants as compared
to reverse micelles of cationic conventional surfactants. Also, in
the present case, the observed decrease in average solvation time
with increasing Wo reveals that the solvent
reorganization is dependent on the water loading and water pool size.
Our results are similar to the solvation dynamics in AOT reverse micelles
reported before.3,50,94,95 The rate of solvation becomes faster as
a result of the migration of dye molecules to the water pool with
increasing loading of water in AOT reverse micelles. Levinger and
Corbeil35 have observed the dependence
of the solvation rate on water loading in their study with the dye
molecule, Coumarin-343, located at the interface of the reverse micelles
of SDS and CTAB. However, the faster rate of solvation in the present
reverse micellar systems as compared to that in AOT reverse micelles
is again because of the bigger water pool size of the former than
the latter.

In order to describe the different states of water
molecules responsible
for bimodal solvation dynamics and also the effects of reverse micelle
pool size and the spacer chain length on the dynamics of solvation,
we have analyzed the O–H stretching band of water solubilized
in the reverse micelles following the method given by Zhao et al.,69 using FT-IR spectroscopy. The fact that different
solvents have been used for the stabilization of present reverse micelles,
as mentioned before, we have carried out experiments using FT-IR to
find different states of water molecules instead of directly using
the results reported by Zhao et al.69 In
the present case, the peaks of the sub-bands are centered at 3235,
3409, 3525, and 3614 cm–1 (at Wo = 20 for 12-5-12 as an example), which correspond to
the O–H stretching modes of water as (i) surfactant headgroup-bound,
(ii) bulklike, (iii) counterion-bound, and (iv) free water, respectively.
After getting the four sub-bands, the average number of water molecules
has been calculated as mentioned above and plotted with varying Wo in Figure 14. The figure shows that the number of bulklike water
molecules per surfactant molecule (Nb)
increases sharply with Wo, the number
of each of headgroup-bound water per surfactant molecule (Nhg) and counterion-bound water per surfactant
molecule (Nci) increases slowly with Wo, and the number of free water molecules per
surfactant molecule (Nf) almost remains
constant. Results are in well agreement with that reported by Zhao
et al.69 for their reverse micellar systems
except for the slow increase in the number of counterion-bound water
as well observed in our study, especially in the case of 12-8-12.
The conductivity experiments have been performed to see any change
in conductance of reverse micellar systems with increasing water content
(Wo) and spacer chain length. Figure 16a shows that the
conductivity increases with an increase in Wo, which means that the degree of dissociation of counterions
rises with an increase in Wo. It can also
be seen from the figure that the increase in the degree of counterion
dissociation is in correspondence to the change in the number of counterion-bound
water per surfactant molecule (Figure 16b). Similar to that reported by Zhao et
al.,69 we have also observed that the number
of free water molecules per surfactant molecule is very low. These
free water molecules are different from the bulk water molecules77 and are dispersed among the hydrophobic tails
of surfactant molecules.69 The number of
bulklike water molecules per surfactant molecule (Nb) increases with increasing Wo, which causes the gradual swelling of reverse micelles supported
by an increase in the hydrodynamic diameter, as discussed above (Table 4). With a growing
water pool size, the interfacial curvature is reduced. As a result,
more number of water molecules can hydrate the headgroups and also
some n-propanol molecules get expelled from the interface.
That is why there is a gradual increase in headgroup-bound water per
surfactant molecule with increasing Wo.

As mentioned above, according to the model proposed by Bagchi
and
co-workers,20 free water and bound water,
those are in dynamic exchange with each other, are responsible for
fast and slow solvation components, respectively. In the present case,
FT-IR results infer that there are two types of bound water molecules:
headgroup-bound and counterion-bound. Water molecules designated as
free water in the FT-IR study are those that exist in very small quantity
in the reverse micelles and are dispersed along the surfactant tails.
It is very unlikely that these molecules would take part in solvation
as C-490 molecules are mostly present at the micellar interface and
in water pool. It is evidenced by the fact that solvation becomes
faster with an increasing number of bulklike water molecules per surfactant
molecule. The data in Table 2 imply that the time constants for the fast component become
shorter with increasing the Wo. Also,
the weightage of the fast component is more than that of the slow
component. These results thus support the fact that water molecules
are mostly responsible for solvation dynamics, and the bulklike water
mainly contributes to the faster solvation observed. Also, C-490 molecules
are primarily located inside the reverse micelles, and more and more
C-490 molecules get transferred from the interface to the water pool
with increasing loading of water. Although the number of bulklike
water molecules per surfactant molecule increases, the number of free
water molecules per surfactant molecule remains unchanged with increasing
pool size. As stated, the number of bulklike water molecules per surfactant
molecule increases rapidly, whereas there is a small increase in the
number of headgroup-bound and counterion-bound water molecules per
surfactant molecule with increasing Wo. The rate of solvation increases with increasing Wo because the contribution of bulklike water outweighs
that of bound water. Thus, as mentioned above, the bulklike water
molecules are mostly responsible for the fast solvation and headgroup-
and counterion-bound water molecules are responsible for the slow
solvation. The data of decay parameters given in Table 2 support the results which show
that the relative contribution toward the solvation by the fast component
is significantly greater than that by the slow component. It is important
to note that in the present case, the bulklike water plays the same
role as free water plays in the model proposed by Bagchi and co-workers.20 Also, the bulklike water solubilized in the
reverse micelles is not the same as neat bulk water in the true sense.
The dynamics of bulklike water in confined water pool of reverse micelles
is much slower than that of the neat bulk water. According to Senapati
and Chandra,96 the retardation of the solvation
rate in a cavity is because of the slower orientational relaxation
of the solvents.

In order to find out the reasons behind the
decrease in the solvation
rate with an increase in the spacer chain length at a given Wo [Figure 10], the dependence of the number of different states
of water molecules per surfactant molecule on the spacer chain length
has been studied. Figure 15b represents the relationship between the number of different
states of water molecules per surfactant molecule (Ni) and the spacer chain length of gemini surfactants at Wo = 20 as a representative. One can see from
this figure that, with an increase in the spacer chain length, while
the number of bulklike water molecules per surfactant molecule decreases,
the number of counterion-bound water molecules increases. The degree
of counterion dissociation enhances with an increase in the spacer
chain length at a given Wo, as evident
from the conductivity data shown in Figure 16a. This result is in support of an increase
in the number of counterion-bound water with an increase in the spacer
length.63,71 Because of this reason, more and more clustering
of water molecules occurs with an increasing the chain length of the
spacer. Therefore, the proportion of “bound” water molecules
increases. On the other hand, the proportion of bulklike water molecules
that act as so-called “free” water molecules decreases
with increasing spacer chain length. The numbers of headgroup-bound
water molecules and that of free water molecules per surfactant molecule
remain almost unchanged. DLS data (Table 4) show that the size of the reverse micelles
decreases with an increase in the spacer chain length. As a result
of it, the mobility of water molecules becomes restricted and the
solvation process becomes slower with an increase in the spacer chain
length at a given Wo. Thus counterions
indirectly control the rate of the solvation process. These results
further indicate that the collective motion at the interface, including
the restricted motion of clustered water molecules hydrogen-bonded
with Br– ions, constrained n-propanol,
and a few water molecules bound to the surfactant could contribute
to slower solvation. It is noteworthy that some contribution from n-propanol to the solvation dynamics in the water pool cannot
be totally ruled out.

The time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy
decays were recorded
to know more about the microenvironment of C-490 in the reverse micelles
of gemini surfactants. The rotational relaxation time of C-490 in n-propanol is slower than that in the bulk solvent (Table 3). We could not measure
the rotational relaxation time in cyclohexane because of the limitations
of our setup. It must be faster than that in the bulk solvent. Hazra
et al.51 reported faster rotational relaxation
of C-480 in cyclohexane as compared to cyclohexane/1-hexanol bulk
solvent. Comparatively, slower rotational relaxation in n-propanol is due to the formation of the hydrogen bonds between C-490
molecules and n-propanol. The rotational relaxation
of C-490 in reverse micelles is slower than that in the bulk solvent
(Table 3), which implies
that C-490 molecules are mostly present inside the micelles. The data
in Table 3 also depict
that the anisotropy decays in all reverse micelles are bimodal in
nature. The fast rotational relaxation is a more abundant (∼95%)
component than the slow rotational relaxation in all reverse micellar
systems. Therefore, the fast rotational motion of C-490 is mainly
responsible for depolarization to take place and the anisotropy to
become zero. Data also show that while the rotational relaxation time
for the fast component decreases with Wo, there is no clear trend in the change in relaxation time for the
slower component. However, the relative amplitude or the relative
contribution toward the anisotropy decay from the fast component increases
and the same from the slow component decreases with increasing water
pool size. The average rotational relaxation time decreases on increasing Wo (Figure 12). Rotational relaxation data thus reflect that C-490
molecules progressively experience a more flexible microenvironment
with increasing water loading. It is because the number of bulklike
water molecules per surfactant molecule increases rapidly with increasing Wo (Figure 12), the reverse micelles progressively swell, and the
dye molecules migrate from the interface to the water pool. Also,
the fact that the fast component is mostly contributing toward the
anisotropy decay and there is an increase in the contribution from
the fast component and a concomitant decrease in the contribution
from the second component with increasing Wo, the bi-exponential anisotropy decay is primarily due to two different
locations of C-490 molecules. Even if the slow rotational motion is
due to the lateral diffusion along the interface of reverse micelles
and/or rotational motions of micelles as a whole, that contribution
is negligibly small (only ∼5%). Figure 12 also shows that the average rotational
relaxation time increases with an increase in the spacer chain length
of gemini surfactants at a given Wo. It
has been discussed above that with the increasing the chain length
of the spacer, the water pool size is reduced and also the degree
of counter ion dissociation is increased at a given Wo. As a result of these, the number of bulklike water
per surfactant molecule decreases and the number of counterion-bound
water per surfactant molecule increases (Figure 15). Both these factors are in favor of increasing
rigidity of the microenvironment around C-490. That is why, rotational
relaxation process becomes slower with increasing spacer chain length
of gemini surfactants for a fixed water content.

4 Conclusions
The microenvironment around C-490 in the reverse micelles becomes
more polar with an increase in the water pool size because of progressive
increment in bulklike water molecules and also the migration of C-490
to the water pool from the interface. At a given Wo, the polarity of the microenvironment decreases with
an increase in the spacer chain length of gemini surfactants. The
solubilized water in the reverse micelles has four different states
of water: headgroup- and counterion-bound water, bulklike water, and
free water. While headgroup- and counterion-bound water molecules
contribute to slow solvation, the bulklike water molecules contribute
to fast solvation. Free water molecules do not contribute to any solvation
process. The fast component contributes more to the solvation as compared
to the slow component as the bulklike water is more abundant. The
solvation rate increases with increasing Wo because of the sharp increase in the number of bulklike water molecules
per surfactant molecule. An increment in the rate of the rotational
relaxation process with increasing Wo is
due to gradual swelling of reverse micelles. With an increase in the
spacer chain length at a given Wo, the
degree of counterion dissociation increases and the size of the water
pool decreases. As a result, the number of counterion-bound water
molecules increases and that of bulklike water molecules decreases.
Because of greater extent of clustering of water molecules with an
increment in the spacer chain length, there is progressively an increase
in contribution of bound-water molecules toward slow solvation and
a concomitant decrease in contribution of bulklike water molecules
toward fast solvation. Thus, the rate of solvation decreases. Also,
because of the progressive increase in the rigidity of the water molecules,
the rate of rotational relaxation process of C-490 decreases with
increasing spacer chain length. An indirect effect of counterions
on the rates of solvation and rotational relaxation has been noted.
The faster rates of solvation and rotational relaxation in the present
reverse micelles as compared to the reverse micelles of conventional
cationic surfactants is due to a comparatively bigger size of the
water pool of the present reverse micelles. The mobility of water
molecules is relatively faster in the water pool of reverse micelles
of cationic gemini surfactants as compared to conventional cationic
surfactants. The fact that reverse micelles behave as biomimicking
systems and water has a great role in various biological processes,
the study of comprehensive effects of different states of solubilized
water in the reverse micelles on the solvation dynamics and rotational
relaxation processes and how these are controlled by the spacer chain
length of gemini surfactants have practical and fundamental importance.

5 Experimental Section
Three gemini surfactants with
different spacer chain lengths, 12-s-12, 2Br– (s = 5, 6,
and 8) were synthesized following the reported method56,57 and recrystallized with methanol and ethyl acetate mixture several
times. The structures of the synthesized compounds (Scheme 1) were confirmed by 1H NMR and FT-IR data. The details of 1H NMR and FT-IR
data for 12-5-12 have been provided in Table S1, Supporting Information, whereas for 12-6-12 and 12-8-12, the
details are provided in our previous publication.63 C-490, procured from Sigma-Aldrich, was used as the fluorescent
probe for the studies and was used without any further purification.
Zhao et al.69 prepared reverse micelles
in n-heptane with the assistance of n-hexanol. However, in the present study, with C-490 as a fluorescent
solute, we could prepare reverse micelles in cyclohexane (CYH) as
a nonpolar bulk phase and n-propanol as the cosurfactant.
Stable reverse micelles were formed only after the addition of n-propanol. All the solvents used were of spectroscopic
grade purchased from Spectrochem Chemical Company, India. The water
pool of the reverse micelles was prepared using Milli-Q water, obtained
from a Millipore water filtration system. The final concentration
of C-490 and that of gemini surfactants were maintained as 0.01 and
20 mM, respectively, in all the measurements. A stock solution of
the surfactant was prepared in CYH and n-propanol.
The reverse micelle solutions were prepared by the addition of the
calculated amount of each of the surfactant from the stock solution
followed by the addition of the estimated amount of water. A final
concentration of n-propanol was maintained as 10%
by adding extra n-propanol. Then, CYH was added to
make up the solutions to the desired volume. Finally, the solutions
were shaken gradually until they were optically transparent. The solutions
were transparent once n-propanol was completely dispersed
in the system at the final. All UV–visible absorption and steady-state
fluorescence measurements were performed on a JASCO V-650 UV–visible
spectrophotometer and a HORIBA Jobin Yvon FluoroMax-4 scanning spectrofluorometer,
respectively. The steady-state fluorescence measurements, both excitation
and emission spectra, were recorded with a slit width of 1 nm. The
emission spectra were corrected for instrument sensitivity. A HORIBA
Jobin Yvon Fluorocube-01-NL picosecond TCSPC experimental setup was
used to record the time-resolved measurements. The excited singlet-state
lifetimes were determined from the intensity decays using the same
setup. The light source used was a picosecond diode laser of a wavelength
of 375 nm (NanoLED 375L, IBH, UK) with an instrument response function
of about 165 ps. A TBX-photon detection module (TBX-07C) was used
to detect the fluorescence signals at a magic angle of 54.7°
polarization. The time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy measurements
were performed using the same TCSPC set up. All the spectroscopic
measurements were carried out at room temperature, 298.15 ± 1
K. The time-resolved fluorescence decays and anisotropy data were
analyzed using IBH DAS-6, decay analysis software. Each decay profile
was fitted with bi or triexponential fitting, keeping in mind the
goodness of the fit, judged by the χ2 criterion and
visual inspection of the residuals of the fitted function to the data.
The χ2 value must lie between 1 and 1.2. The average
excited singlet state lifetime, ⟨τf⟩,
for a biexponential intensity decay has been calculated by using eq 1 1  where α1 and α2 are relative amplitudes, and α1 + α2 = 1. τ1 and τ2 are the
lifetimes of the two components.

The solvation dynamics studies
were carried out using the methodology
proposed by Fleming and Maroncelli.74 The
decay profiles at different emission wavelengths across the entire
range of a steady-state emission spectrum were obtained. The TRES
at different times were constructed from the appropriately normalized
intensity decay functions for the various wavelengths at various times.
The TRES at each time then were fitted to a log normal fitting, and
the peak wavenumber at each time, υ̅(t), was acquired.74,78,89 The obtained peak wavenumbers were used to get the SCF, C(t), for the quantitative measurement
of solvation dynamics of the probe using eq 2 2  where, υ̅(0), υ̅(t), and
υ̅(∞) are the peak wavenumbers
at time zero, t, and infinity, respectively.

The time constants of the observed solvation were obtained after
fitting the plot of SCF, C(t) versus
time. The biexponential function was used to obtain time constants
for solvation using eq 3 3  where τ1s and τ2s are the solvent relaxation times of corresponding relative
amplitudes, α1s and α2s, respectively;
α1s + α2s = 1. The average solvation
time, ⟨τs⟩, for a biexponential decay
is calculated by using eq 4 4  

The time-resolved fluorescence
anisotropy, r(t), was calculated
using eq 5 5  where G signifies the correction
factor for the detector sensitivity to the polarization detection
of emission, and I||(t) and I⊥(t) denote
fluorescence decays polarized parallel and perpendicular to the polarization
of the excitation light, respectively. The value of G-factor for our instrument is ∼0.6. The biexponential anisotropy
decay function can be described using eq 6 6  where ro stands
for the limiting anisotropy which represents the inherent depolarization
of the probe molecule, τ1r and τ2r represent first and slow rotational relaxation times, respectively,
of the probe molecule, and α1r and α2r are the corresponding relative amplitudes, where α1r + α2r = 1. The average rotational relaxation time
for the biexponential anisotropy decay is given by eq 7 7  

The FTIR spectrum of each
reverse micellar system was recorded
from 1000 to 4000 cm–1 with a ABB Bomen MB 3000
FTIR spectrometer. NaCl (25 × 4 mm) FTIR cell windows with path
length 0.05 mm were used to record the spectra. Each spectrum was
recorded at 32 scans at a resolution of 1 cm–1 at
room temperature. The absorption of the bulk solvent (cyclohexane
and n-propanol) was taken as the reference for all
cases. The stretching frequency region of the O–H of water
molecules (3000–3800 cm–1) was fitted with
the help of software, presented according to the Gaussian fittings.
The deconvoluted peaks help to study about the different states of
water present in the reverse micelles. An instrument Zeta Sizer, model
Nano ZS (ZEN 3600, Malvern Instruments, UK) was used to carry out
the DLS measurements to know about the hydrodynamic size of the reverse
micelles. Each sample was filtered before the measurements with a
0.22 μm filter (Durapore, PVDF). Laser light of wavelength 632.8
nm was used, and 173° was kept as the scattering angle. The size
distribution was carefully judged by considering the corresponding G function. The shape and size of the reverse micelles were
also known with the help of FE-SEM (FEI-Apreo S). The samples were
drop-casted over silicon wafer and dried to prepare a thin film. The
samples were then spin-coated with 2 nm silver before recording the
images.
