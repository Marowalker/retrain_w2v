Carbon
dioxide (CO2) is becoming more attractive as
a renewable feedstock for chemical synthesis. In this study, CO2 was incorporated into poly(ether carbonate) (PEC) polyols
by using a double-metal-cyanide catalyst. By adjusting the CO2 pressure, the content of propylene carbonate units in the
PEC polyols was controlled, indicating successful and semiquantitative
incorporation of CO2 into the PEC polyols. Polyurethane
foams (PUFs) with different propylene carbonate content were easily
prepared at room temperature by employing the PEC polyols due to their
adequate viscosity under ambient conditions. The firmness of the PUFs
increased as the amount of propylene carbonate units increased due
to the rigidity of the carbonate linkage, representing predictable
mechanical properties. Interestingly, reduced generation of volatile
organic compounds (VOCs) from the PUFs, namely acetaldehyde, was observed
with a high content of propylene carbonate units at 120 °C, indicating
good stability of the carbonate units against thermo-oxidative decomposition.
This study demonstrates the importance of CO2 as an environmental-friendly
and renewable resource that can provide not only industrially important
but also problem-solving products in terms of processability and low
generation of VOCs.

==== Body
Introduction
Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a highly attractive renewable
resource due to its abundant, inexpensive, and nontoxic nature. Various
approaches for chemical fixation of CO2 have been attempted
to address the growing concern of global warming.1−5 The utilization of CO2 as a starting material
to prepare industrially important polymers is particularly interesting
and not only contributes to the reduction of greenhouse gas but also
provides a value-added product.6−9 In this regard, the preparation of polyols from CO2 has been an interesting topic for chemists and chemical engineers.7,10−12

Polyols are an important raw material for the
production of polyurethane
(PU) and can be classified into three different types: polyester,
polyether, and polycarbonate (PC).13 Essentially,
the production of polyols from CO2 leads to the copolymerization
between CO2 and epoxides due to its low energy level.3,12 Through this copolymerization, CO2 is incorporated into
polyols as a carbonate unit.14,15 Depending on the catalyst,
this copolymerization produces two different types of copolymers with
different compositions: PC polyol or poly(ether carbonate) (PEC) polyol
(Scheme 1a). The use
of selected Lewis acid catalysts produces PC polyols with improved
biodegradability and anticorrosion properties.11,16,17 However, the use of the PC polyol as a raw
material to prepare PUs is not easy because of its high glass transition
temperature (Tg) and high viscosity at
room temperature.7,17

Structure of PC and PEC Polyols (a) and Copolymerization

(DMC) Catalyst in the Presence of Polyhydric Alcohol Initiator to
Afford PEC Polyols (b)
CO2-based PEC polyols, containing both carbonate
and
ether linkages in their chemical structure, can be prepared by using
a double-metal-cyanide (DMC) catalyst (Scheme 1b).7,18,19 DMC catalysts, such as zinc–cobalt and zinc–nickel
DMC catalysts, have been demonstrated as efficient catalysts for ring-opening
polymerization of epoxides and CO2.8,9,20−23 CO2-based PEC polyols
from the DMC catalysts exhibited a narrow polydispersity index and
better flexibility than PC polyols due to the ether linkage in their
chemical structure.24 A life cycle assessment
study of the CO2-based PEC polyols suggested a reduction
of greenhouse gases by 11–19% compared with that of conventional
polyether polyols.18 In addition, the PEC
polyols exhibit better hydrolysis resistance and oxidative stability
compared with polyester- and polyether-type polyols.19 Chemical and oxidative stability derived from PEC polyols
are important and highly desirable properties in PU applications.
Therefore, the PEC polyols represent substitutable and sustainable
polyols, which exemplify the chemical conversion of renewable CO2 into valuable products.

PU is an important polymer
that is used in various forms, such
as foams, coatings, elastomers, and adhesives, to name a few.13,25 Owing to its versatility, PU has been used in a wide range of applications,
including automotive seats, furniture, thermal insulators, packaging
materials, and medical devices. Flexible PU foam (PUF) is an interesting
type of PU because of its large number of uses. Flexible PUF is prepared
by the reaction between isocyanates and polyols, where the characteristics
of polyols considerably affect the final properties of PUs. Thus,
an in-depth study needs to be carried out to clarify the correlation
between the properties of the raw materials and the properties of
the resulting PUs.

Recently, a number of attempts to utilize
CO2-based
polyols for the preparation of PUs have been reported. Langanke et
al. reported an initial application of PEC polyols for PUFs.7 DeBolt et al. prepared flexible PUFs with a mixture
of conventional polyether polyols and CO2-based PC polyols.17 Wang et al. reported waterborne PUs with PEC
polyols exhibiting improved hydrolysis and oxidation resistance.19 Orgilés-Calpena et al. reported a PU
adhesive from a mixture of polyester and PC polyols for footwear.26 We also reported thermoplastic PUs from a mixture
of polyether and PC polyols for coatings with improved anticorrosion
properties.11 However, most studies adopted
a mixture of CO2-based polyols and conventional polyols,
mainly due to the aforementioned high viscosity and poor processability
of the PC polyol. Therefore, the development of CO2-based
PEC polyols with inherently improved processability for easy preparation
of PUFs is desired.

In this study, both ether and carbonate
units were incorporated
into one polyol molecule, providing the liquid PEC polyols with a
sufficiently low viscosity at room temperature. Control of the amount
of propylene carbonate units in the PEC polyols was attempted by adjusting
the CO2 pressure to examine the effect of different ether/carbonate
compositions on its characteristics. The effect of propylene carbonate
content on the characteristics of the resulting PUFs was also studied,
including their volatile organic compound (VOC) emission behaviors.
A quantitative analytical tool developed by our group was adopted
to assess the VOC issue by using a headspace-gas chromatography-flame
ionization detector (HS-GC–FID) system.27

used without further purification. Toluene 2,4-diisocyanate (TDI,
>98%) was purchased from Daejung Chemicals (Siheung, Korea) and
stored
under nitrogen. All other chemicals were used without specific purification.

Preparation of DMC Catalyst
The DMC catalyst was prepared
by using EEA and P123 as complexing and co-complexing agents, respectively.
The solution with ZnCl2 (12 g, 88 mmol) and EEA (15 mL,
111 mmol) in water (46 mL) was stirred for 10 min at 50 °C. K3[Co(CN)6] solution containing 1.3 g of K3[Co(CN)6] (3.91 mmol) in 16 mL of water was added to this
solution and stirred for 1 h. The solution of complexing agents, composed
of EEA (13.5 mL, 97.0 mmol) and P123 (0.97 g, 0.167 mmol), was mixed
with the former solution and stirred for an additional 3 min. The
precipitate was collected through centrifugation and washed with a
solution of complexing agents, composed of EEA (6.75 mL, 49.8 mmol)
and P123 (0.485 g, 0.084 mmol), at least three times, followed by
drying under vacuum at 80 °C overnight.

Preparation of PEC Polyols
PEC polyols were synthesized
with the DMC catalyst in a high-pressure reactor (Model No. 4568,
Parr Instrument Company, Figure S1, see
the Supporting Information). A series of PEC polyols with different
propylene carbonate contents were prepared under five different CO2 pressures, namely, 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 bar (Table 1). Glycerol propoxylate was
used as an initiator for preparing PEC polyols. The typical polymerization
procedure was as follows. A quantity of 0.225 g of DMC catalyst was
introduced into the reactor, followed by pressurizing with CO2 to the desired pressure. After heating the reactor to 115
°C, PO (90 mL, 77.31 g) and 30 mL of glycerol propoxylate were
fed into the reactor for 90 min by using an HPLC pump. The polymerization
was stopped after an additional reaction for 30 min. All PEC polyols
were washed through extraction with distilled water to remove cyclic
propylene carbonate (CPC) byproduct.

Preparation of PUFs with
PEC Polyols
PUFs with five
different PEC polyols were prepared following a two-step procedure
(Scheme 2 and Table 2). The representative
procedure to prepare the PUFs is as follows. First, the polyol, tin
catalyst (T-9), amine catalysts (DABCO 33-LV), silicone surfactant
(L-580), and distilled water were stirred in a bath equipped with
an overhead stirrer at 2000 rpm for 3 min (component A). Then, TDI
as component B was added to component A, followed by further stirring
at 2000 rpm for 10 s. The reaction mixture was quickly poured into
an open mold (9.0 cm × 19.0 cm × 8.5 cm) to allow free rising
of the foam. After the foam rising was complete, the foam was thermally
aged in an oven at 110 °C for 5 min. The resulting PUF was then
kept at room temperature for approximately 24 h for stabilization.
The isocyanate index (NCO index, [NCO]/[OH]) was kept constant at
1.1 for all PUFs. Each PUF was prepared at least three times to confirm
the reproducibility of the process.

Characterization
Proton nuclear
magnetic resonance
(1H NMR) was recorded on a Bruker 500 MHz Avance to elucidate
the structural characteristics of the PEC polyols. The 1H NMR spectra were obtained at room temperature using deuterated
chloroform as a solvent. The weight and molar fraction of propylene
carbonate units (Wc and Fc, respectively) in the polymer chain was determined by
the area values of the 1H NMR signals following eqs 1 and 2, respectively23 1   2  where A1.15 and A1.3 are the area values of 1H NMR
signals at 1.15 and 1.3 ppm, respectively. Size-exclusion chromatography
(SEC) was performed on a Shimadzu LC-20A equipped with PSS columns
(Styragel HR 2, 4, and 5) and a Shimadzu RID-10A refractive index
detector. Tetrahydrofuran (HPLC grade) was used as an eluent at a
flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The calibration curve was obtained using
a polystyrene standard. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight
mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) spectra were obtained on a Voyager
mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems). Volumetric titrations to determine
the hydroxyl values of the polyols were performed according to ASTM
D1957-86. The hydroxyl value refers to the weight (in mg) of potassium
hydroxide required to titrate the free acetic acid generated during
the acetylation of hydroxyl groups. The hydroxyl value (mg-KOH/g)
was calculated using the following eq 3 (ASTM D1957-86) 3  where A, B, N, and S are
the volume (in mL)
of the potassium hydroxide solution used for the blank test (without
the sample), the volume (in mL) of the potassium hydroxide solution
used for the titration of the sample, the molar concentration of the
potassium hydroxide solution, and the weight (in g) of the sample,
respectively. The viscosity of PEC polyols was measured on a Brookfield
DV3T Rheometer at 25 °C and 60 rpm. Fourier transform infrared
(FT-IR) spectra were recorded on a Thermo Nicolet 380 FT-IR spectrometer
at a resolution of 4 cm–1 over a wavenumber range
of 4000–650 cm–1. Thermogravimetric analyses
(TGA) were performed on a TGA4000 (PerkinElmer). The samples (7–10
mg) were heated from room temperature to 800 °C under a nitrogen
flow of 20 mL/min at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. The core density
of the PUF samples was determined according to ASTM standard D3574-03.
Four samples per foam formulation were measured, and the average result
was reported. The mechanical properties of the PUFs were investigated
by subjecting dumbbell-shaped specimens to tensile tests. The tensile
tests were performed using a universal testing machine (AGS-5kNX,
Shimadzu) at room temperature following ASTM standard D3574-03. The
results from at least three samples were averaged to determine the
mechanical property values. Detailed experimental procedures to determine
the amount of acetaldehyde (AA) by using HS-GC–FID are described
in our previous report.27 A Shimadzu GC-2010
instrument equipped with a DB-624 capillary column (60 m × 0.25
mm × 1.4 μm, Agilent) and FID was employed for the GC experiments.
The HS thermal treatment was conducted at 120 °C for 20 min by
using a manual HS machine from Netel India Ltd.

Results and Discussion
CO2-based PEC polyols were prepared by using DMC catalyst
with EEA as a complexing agent. The DMC–EEA catalyst efficiently
provided bifunctional PEC polyol with high yield, as evidenced by
the average OH functionality values (2.10–2.75, Table 1) and the high conversion of
PO (77.20–99.96%, Table 1).28 The DMC–EEA catalyst
also incorporated CO2 into PEC polyols efficiently, as
confirmed by relatively high Wc values
from 1H NMR investigations (Table 1 and Figure 1).

Figure 1 Representative 1H NMR spectra of PEC polyols:
PEC polyol-0
and -24.

The signals of 1H NMR
at 1.1–1.2 ppm represent
protons in the CH3 groups in propylene ether units (Figure 1). The negligible
intensity of the signal g at 1.6 ppm (protons of the CH3 group in CPC as a byproduct) of PEC polyol-24 in Figure 1 demonstrated favored incorporation
of CO2 into polyol chains (relatively low amounts of CPC
byproducts versus polyol products in Table 1) and efficient removal of the byproduct
by washing procedure with water (Figure S2, see the Supporting Information).23,29 During this
washing procedure, the DMC catalyst was also believed to be removed
through decomposition. Signals at 4.8–5.0, 3.9–4.3,
and 1.3–1.5 ppm of PEC polyol-24 in Figure 1 were assigned to CH, CH2, and
CH3 groups in propylene carbonate units, respectively.
Obviously, the intensities of these signals increased with higher
CO2 pressure during the preparation of PEC polyols (Figure S3, see the Supporting Information). The
PEC polyols exhibited Wc values of 0,
9.39, 16.03, 19.51, and 24.29 wt % for PEC polyol-0, -9, -16, -20,
and -24, respectively. The results suggested a controlled incorporation
of CO2 into the PEC polyol chains simply by adjusting the
CO2 pressure during copolymerization. It should also be
noted that the decreased amount of polyols (the amount of polyol product
and the productivity values in Table 1) and more amount of CPC byproducts (CPC by-product
values in Table 1)
were obtained with higher pressure of CO2, likely due to
decreased stability of zinc-carboxylate intermediates against back-biting
decomposition reaction of the DMC catalyst.29

The incorporation of CO2 into polyols as propylene
carbonate
units was also confirmed by a molecular weight investigation (Figures 2 and S4, see the Supporting Information). MALDI-TOF
MS spectra of the polyether polyol (e.g., PEC polyol-0 in Figure 2) and PEC polyol
(e.g., PEC polyol-24 in Figure 2) exhibited molecular weight differences between the peaks
of 58 g/mol (green arrows), representing the presence of propylene
ether units. At the same time, PEC polyols prepared under pressurized
CO2 (PEC polyol-24 in Figure 2 and PEC polyol 9, 16, 20, and 24 in Figure S4, see the Supporting Information) additionally
exhibited molecular weight difference between the peaks of 102 g/mol
(purple arrows). The molecular weight difference of 102 g/mol clearly
represented the presence of propylene carbonate units. The exact molecular
weight values of the PEC polyols (Mn,Maldi in Table 1) determined
from the MALDI-TOF MS spectra decreased with increased CO2 pressure, also suggesting a retarded propagation reaction of the
DMC catalyst in the presence of CO2.29 The decreased molecular weight values of the PEC polyols
with higher CO2 pressure were also confirmed by SEC analyses
(Table 1). The number
average molecular weight values of the PEC polyols determined by SEC
analyses (Mn,SEC) were slightly higher
than the corresponding Mn,Maldi values,
likely due to the different hydrodynamic volumes of the polystyrene
standards employed for SEC analyses.

Figure 2 Representative MALDI-TOF MS spectra of
PEC polyols: PEC polyol-0
and -24.

To determine the hydroxyl value
of PEC polyols, a titration method
(ASTM D1957-86) was used (Table 1). The hydroxyl values were 73, 68, 70, 79, and 85
mg-KOH/g for PEC polyol-0, -9, -16, -20, and -24, respectively. The
average hydroxyl functionalities per PEC polyol molecule calculated
from the hydroxyl values and Mn,Maldi values
were 2.75, 2.50, 2.41, 2.29, and 2.10 for PEC polyol-0, -9, -16, -20,
and -24, respectively. A sufficiently high OH functionality (>2)
ensured
the usefulness of the polyols for the preparation PU,30−32 although the hydroxyl functionality values slightly decreased under
increased CO2 pressure.

In previous studies, the
active sites of the DMC catalyst are proposed
to be cationic.33 Typically, epoxide monomer
is first coordinated onto the Zn sites to replace complexing agent,
followed by transfer reaction to initiator (i.e., glycerol propoxylate
in this study) and/or insertion of epoxide monomers for propagation
(Figure S5, see the Supporting Information).34 Zn–O-polymer may then decompose to Zn–OH
and HO-polymer to afford polymers with OH groups. Therefore, transfer
reaction to initiator should be facilitated to ensure high enough
OH functionalities. With increasing CO2 pressure, both
chain-transfer reaction of cationic species to initiator (glycerol
propoxylate in this study) and propagation reaction become hindered
due to less active carboxylate intermediate, resulting in decreased
hydroxyl functionality and molecular weight values of the polymers.
Considering the lowered hydroxyl functionality values of the polymers
in the presence of CO2, in this study, initiator with three
OH functionality (glycerol propoxylate) was employed to ensure high
enough hydroxyl functionality (>2) of the PEC polyols for the preparation
of PUFs.

PC polyols, such as petroleum-based UH-200 and CO2-based
Converge Polyol 212-20, are waxy solids at room temperature (Figure S6, see the Supporting Information), likely
due to rigid carbonate linkages in their chemical structures.24,35 The solid state of the polyols did not allow their room-temperature
use to prepare PUFs following conventional procedures. Proposed solutions
to solve the problem include either mixing with liquid PPG, mixing
with solvent, or elevating the temperature to melt the waxy polyols.
However, the PC polyols exhibited poor miscibility with PPG even at
elevated temperature (70 °C, Figure S7, see the Supporting Information), which led to complicated and undesirable
reaction kinetics due to mass transfer issues of the components.36 Mixing the PC polyols with a solvent (e.g.,
DBE) often caused odorous PUFs with inferior properties due to the
presence of solvent. The PC polyols still exhibited high viscosity
(for Converge Polyol 212-20, viscosity ∼100 000 cps
at 75 °C as reported in its data sheet) and deteriorated reaction
kinetics with TDI at elevated temperatures, which did not allow the
preparation of PUFs by conventional procedures and facilities.17 Thus, PEC polyols, which are liquid at room
temperature due to inherently flexible ether linkages in their chemical
structure, are rationally preferred for the facile and routine preparation
of PUF. The PEC polyols prepared in this study were liquid with relatively
low viscosity under ambient conditions (582–3082 cps at 25
°C in Table 1),
allowing facile and reproducible preparation of PUFs simply by reacting
with TDI at room temperature by using conventional facilities.

Scheme 2 demonstrates
the successful preparation of foams with similar appearance and density
values. The density values of the foams were controlled to be similar
to each other (∼39 kg/m3, Scheme 2) for a reasonable comparison between the
samples. The preparation of the foams was quite reproducible, as evidenced
by the relatively low-density standard deviation values for repeatedly
prepared foams.

The successful preparation of the PUFs was also
confirmed by the
presence of characteristic peaks of urethane linkage in the FT-IR
spectra (Figure 3a).37 Characteristic FT-IR peaks of −NH at
3390 cm–1, −C=O at 1720–1700
cm–1, −NH–CO at 1530 cm–1, and C–O at 1080 cm–1 were distinct, representing
urethane linkages. A characteristic remaining peak of −N=C=O
was also observed at ∼2270 cm–1 due to the
excess use of diisocyanate (NCO index = 1.1).38 As the content of propylene carbonate units increased (Wc values in Table 1), the characteristic peaks of carbonate linkage increased,
as shown in Figure 3b (−C=O at 1720–1700 cm–1)
and Figure 3c (−CO–O–
at 1260 cm–1).

Figure 3 FT-IR spectra of PUFs in the range of
650–4000 cm–1 (a): enlarged spectra in the
range of 1600–1900 cm–1 (b) and 1150–1450
cm–1 (c).

The mechanical properties of the PUFs are presented in Figure 4 and Table S1. Tensile stress–strain curves
of the PUFs (Figure 4a) represented typical flexible PUFs with relatively high elongation
at break values (Figure 4b). PUF-0 exhibited elongation at break values of ∼199% and
modulus values of ∼82 kPa (Table S1), which essentially represent a flexible PUF with conventional PPG-based
polyols. Decreased elongation at break values and increased modulus
values of the PUFs were observed with increased content of propylene
carbonate units (Figure 4b,d and Table S1). The results stemmed
from the relatively rigid nature of the carbonate linkage of PEC polyols,17 indicating that the PUF firmness from the PEC
polyols increased with propylene carbonate content. However, PUFs
from the PEC polyols with different contents of propylene carbonate
units exhibited similar toughness, as evidenced by similar tensile
strength values in Figure 4c and Table S1.

Figure 4 Representative tensile
stress–strain curves (a), elongation
at break (b), tensile strength (c), and modulus at 100% (d) behaviors
of PUFs.

The PUFs exhibited a two-step
thermal degradation behavior (Figure 5a), which was indicated
by the two degradation rate peaks at 300 and 400 °C in their
derivative curves (Figure 5b). The first degradation at approximately 300 °C corresponded
to the decomposition of the urethane linkage of the PUFs. The second
degradation at approximately 400 °C originated from the degradation
of polyols. The results indicated that the effect of carbonate linkage
content on the thermal stability of PUF is not prominent. Slightly
decreased T50% (temperature at 50% weight-loss
in the TGA curve, Table S2) values were
observed with an increased content of propylene carbonate units, which
was, however, also not so dominant. Interestingly, PUFs with a higher
content of carbonate linkage exhibited a relatively lower amount of
ash residue (Table S2). The content of
ash residue decreased from 3.95 wt % (for PUF-0) to 1.60 wt % (for
PUF-24) as the content of propylene carbonate units increased. The
result likely stemmed from the clean burning characteristics of the
carbonate linkage, which may inversely generate CO2 during
the thermal degradation procedure as reported earlier.39

Figure 5 TGA curves (a) and weight-loss derivative curves (b) of
PUFs.

One of the biggest applications
of flexible PUF is automobile parts.
Recently, VOCs in automobiles have become a prime issue due to increased
concerns about the environment and human health, leading increasing
legal regulations. In our previous report, we elucidated the importance
of compositional factors of PU for reducing the generation of VOCs,
notably AA.27 HS-GC–FID was successfully
established for the facile and quantitative monitoring of the generation
of AA at different thermal treatment temperatures and times.

The amount of AA generated from PUF-0 (7.66 ppm in Figure 6) was essentially same as that
generated from a PUF with conventional PPG (7.17 ppm in Figure 6) because PUF-0 was composed
of polyether-based polyol only (Figure 6). Clearly, the amount of AA generated from the PUFs
decreased with increasing content of propylene carbonate units in
the polyols (7.78, 6.31, 4.66, and 2.80 ppm for PUF-9, PUF-16, PUF-20,
and PUF-24, respectively). The results suggested an improved chemical
resistance of the propylene carbonate units in the polyols against
the generation of AA during thermo-oxidative degradation. The reduced
generation of AA in the PUFs containing carbonate units is also supported
by our previous study, where PU with PC polyol exhibited a substantial
reduction of AA emissions due to better thermo-oxidative stability
of the propylene carbonate units against radical-mediated decomposition.27 Overall, these studies demonstrated the potential
of PUFs with CO2-based PEC polyols as promising green and
low-VOC products that can be easily prepared with conventional facilities
under ambient conditions.

and PUFs with PEC
polyols.

Conclusions
As a sustainable feedstock,
a controlled amount of CO2 was introduced into PEC polyols
as propylene carbonate linkages
simply by adjusting the CO2 pressure during the copolymerization
with PO in the presence of DMC catalyst. The CO2-based
PEC polyols were liquid and exhibited relatively low viscosity at
room temperature, allowing the facile preparation of PUFs with conventional
facilities under ambient conditions. The preparation of the foams
was quite reproducible, as evidenced by the relatively low standard
deviation values of the density for the repeatedly prepared foams.
With an increased content of propylene carbonate units, the PUFs exhibited
decreased elongation at break values and increased modulus values,
indicating firm foams with reasonable toughness. The PUFs with higher
contents of carbonate units also exhibited relatively lower amounts
of ash residue. Interestingly, a reduced amount of AA was generated
from thermo-oxidative degradation of PUF with a high content of propylene
carbonate units, suggesting improved chemical resistance of propylene
carbonate units of the polyols against the generation of free radicals
and AA. These results demonstrated a facile technical pathway to prepare
eco-friendly PUFs at ambient conditions from green and renewable CO2 resources. The PUFs exhibited predictable mechanical properties
and low VOC emission characteristics.
