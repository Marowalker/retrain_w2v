Lignocellulose is a complex of cellulose,
hemicellulose, and lignin,
whose overall conversion is still a challenge, especially by a fast
and efficient method. Here, a very simple method has been developed
using acidic molten salt of zinc chloride hydrate as the solvent and
catalyst for complete disassembly of lignocellulose at 95 °C
and atmospheric pressure in 12 min. The major products are lignin
and monosaccharides, such as glucose and xylose. It was found that
high-purity lignin in yield of about 20 wt % can be obtained with
various biomass, and the maximum yield of glucose from bamboo is 40.56
wt % and that of xylose from wheat straw is 16.82 wt %. Importantly,
zinc chloride can be recovered through precipitation by ammonia and
reused for next cycles. It provides a simple route to separate and
efficiently convert lignocellulose, especially high-grade feedstock
for biorefinery.

Introduction
Lignocellulosic biomass,
a kind of renewable carbon resource, has
attracted much attention to produce biomass-based fuels and other
platform chemicals or materials.1 Lignin,
cellulose, and hemicellulose are the three major component biopolymers
of lignocellulosic biomass and potential feedstock that can serve
as alternative to fossil resources in the near future. It is still
a challenge to find a new and efficient method to convert lignocellulose
and its components into valuable chemicals or materials. Nowadays,
two routes have been employed for this conversion: (i) depolymerization
of lignocellulose directly without distinguishing its components,
such as thermal pyrolysis and gasification, which usually regard biomass
as a mixture of C, H, and O elements, and the degraded products are
so complex that upgrade is generally required,2 and (ii) fractionation of lignocellulose to cellulose, hemicellulose,
or lignin and then their conversion to the desired chemicals or materials,
with the major obstacle being efficient disassembly of the robust
complex.3 A similar problem was also faced
by paper-making industries, especially for the nonwoody biomass.

From a chemical perspective, the interactions among the three major
components include hydrogen bonding between the cellulose and lignin,
as well as between the cellulose and hemicellulose, and covalent bonds
(mainly ether bonds) between cellulose and lignin. Therefore, disassembly
of lignocellulose usually requires rigorous chemical or special physical
treatment, with plenty of pollutants formed during the processes.
Recently, green solvents and technologies have been developed to solve
this problem, and ionic liquids are known for their ability to directly
dissolve cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, and even raw lignocellulose
at low temperature, and have been used as solvents for biomass green
conversion.4 However, ionic liquids are
still expensive, and their recovery and reuse is still a challenge.
As a kind of ionic liquid-like system, inorganic molten salt hydrates
are inexpensive and easily obtained. In addition, they are environmentally
friendly due to their nontoxicity and nonvolatility. Interestingly,
it is well known that molten salt hydrates have excellent ability
to dissolve polysaccharides, such as cellulose and hemicellulose,
and can be used as media for their hydrolysis,5 such as cellulose hydrolysis in acidified LiBr molten salt hydrate
media6 and synthesis of furfurals from
biopolymers in molten salt hydrate.7 However,
they showed limited ability to dissolve lignin, which provides an
opportunity to quantitate lignin in lignocellulosic biomass, such
as acidic lithium bromide trihydrate.8 The
key point of efficient utilization of lignocelluloses is their disassembly
by a simple and mild method and then conversion of the relative fractions
to valuable building block molecules, intermediates, or materials.
So, molten salt hydrates may be a suitable medium for efficient and
direct production of lignin and relative monosaccharides in a one-pot
process, especially with various molten salt hydrates by recovery
and reutilization.

Lignin is a complex aromatic polymer with
network structure that
consists of three phenylpropane units, p-hydroxyphenyl
(H), guaiacyl (G), and syringyl (S), linked through β-O-4 and
C–C bonds in different combinations.9 The ratio of phenylpropane units and the amount of linkages and
functional groups are significantly different, depending on plant
species.10 Many researchers have conducted
a great deal of experiments to study the isolation and quantitation
of lignin from lignocellulose to enhance the utilization of lignin
for chemicals and biofuels in the biorefinery.11 However, the formation of humins from dehydration products
of sugars under acidic condition caused lignin overestimation.12 The key step of isolation of lignin from lignocellulose
is the degradation of polysaccharides, especially cellulose. It is
well known that cellulose can be dissolved in some inorganic molten
salt hydrates, including LiClO4·3H2O, LiI2·2H2O, LiBr·3H2O, LiSCN·2H2O, ZnCl2·3H2O, Ca(NCS)2·3H2O, and a eutectic mixture of NaSCN/KCN/LiSCN·3H2O.4,13 Among them, zinc chloride hydrate is most
frequently used as a medium to dissolve and hydrolyze cellulose, but
it can never be used for lignocellulose directly.

Here, we developed
a facile and quick one-step method to isolate
high-purity lignin and degrade cellulose and hemicellulose to relative
monosaccharides from lignocellulosic biomass, and this process is
the basis for efficient conversion of lignocellulose to valuable chemicals
and materials (Scheme 1). In brief, acidic zinc chloride (AZC) hydrate molten salt was used
as a solvent, which could swell and dissolve cellulose and hemicellulose
quickly and completely. Meanwhile, cellulose and hemicelluloses can
be hydrolyzed under acidic conditions and isolate lignin as an insoluble
residue (IR). The structure, composition, and purity of lignin were
characterized by means of two-dimensional (2D) heteronuclear single
quantum correlation (HSQC) NMR spectroscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy
(EDS), and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. In addition,
an environmentally friendly and efficient method to recycle and reuse
zinc chloride from filtrate is developed.

Method for Lignin Quantitation
Results and Discussion
Isolation and Quantitation of Lignin
Zinc chloride
hydrate is a general inorganic salt, whose molten salt is an excellent
solvent for cellulose and hemicellulose. This is because the zinc
cation (Zn2+) and the chloride anion (Cl–) are able to interact with the oxygen atoms (O) and hydrogen atoms
(H) of the cellulose hydroxyl groups, respectively, and form hydrogen
bonds with cellulose.14 The cellulose–Zn2+ and cellulose–Cl– interactions
will lead to the breakage of the intra- and intermolecular hydrogen
bonds of cellulose at elevated temperature. In addition, they could
destroy the rigorous crystalline structure of cellulose and make it
swollen, which can be dissolved.5,13,14 Thereby, the glycosidic linkages of the carbohydrates and lignin
were exposed fully and cleaved under mild dilute acid conditions.
The homogeneous system generated on the basis of dissolution is conducive
to facilitate the hydrolysis of hemicelluloses and cellulose. As a
result, all kinds of corresponding monosaccharides, such as glucose,
xylose, etc., could be obtained. In brief, as shown in Scheme 1, it provides a one-step method
to isolate high-purity lignin and monosaccharides (such as glucose,
xylose, mannose) from lignocellulosic biomass using acidic zinc chloride.
The obtained lignin and monosaccharides can be used as platform feedstock
for efficient biorefinery, and valuable chemicals or materials can
be obtained from them, which makes the overall utilization of lignocellulose
possible.10

Figure 1 shows the photographs of the processes of
fast disassembly of lignocellulose (wheat straw) in acidic molten
salt of zinc chloride hydrate and isolation of pure lignin and monosaccharides
with the recovery of zinc chloride by ammonia. First, a powder of
wheat straw and zinc chloride hydrate was mixed homogeneously and
then acidic solution (HCl) was added under stirring at 95 °C.
The disassembly of straw was quick and formed a black liquid after
12 min, indicating the complete disassembly of lignocellulose. After
adding ethyl acetate, some solid formed and the product was separated
into solid and liquid by filtration. The solid is insoluble lignin,
whereas the liquid contains soluble zinc chloride and monosaccharides
degraded from both cellulose and hemicellulose. After decolorization
and addition of ammonium hydroxide, plenty of precipitates of zinc
compounds formed. After separating and dissolving the precipitates
in hydrochloric acid aqueous solution, a clear transparent solution
was obtained, which was heated at 400 °C to obtain white zinc
chloride, indicating the successful recovery of the salt. In addition,
when the filtrate was cooled, plenty of white sugars formed, as shown
in Figure 1. Clearly,
wheat straw was quickly disassembled into lignin and sugars and zinc
chloride hydrate can be well recovered.

Figure 1 Photographs of lignocellulose
(wheat straw) disassembly by acidic zinc chloride hydrate molten salt
to lignin and sugars (95 °C, 12 min), with recovery of zinc chloride
that can be reused by ammonia.

In addition, under such condition, a small fraction of monosaccharides
could be dehydrated to furfural (from pentoses) and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural
(HMF, from hexoses). Only a trace amount of the lignin residue could
be dissolved and quantitated by UV spectrophotometry.

Factors Affecting
Lignin Quantitation Using the AZC Method
Overall, to disassemble
lignocellulose, it is vital to remove and
hydrolyze cellulose and hemicellulose completely. Although cellulose
could be dissolved in zinc chloride molten salt efficiently, its hydrolysis
needs Brønsted acid as a catalyst to destroy glycosidic bond.
First, acid concentration plays a key role in the efficient and complete
hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose. As illustrated in Figure 2a,b, the yield curves
of insoluble wheat straw residue dropped to the lowest value of 18.62
wt % at 1.5 M HCl aqueous solution. When the acid concentration is
less than 1.5 M, hemicellulose and cellulose could not be hydrolyzed
completely, which can be proved by the low yield of glucose and xylose.
However, when the acid concentration reached 2 M, even 3 M, a high
total insoluble residue (2 M for 20.15 wt %, 3 M for 40.39 wt %) was
observed, resulting from the carbonization of lignocellulose under
high acidic concentration, and it facilitated the dehydration of sugars
to HMF and furfural and the formation of humins. Reaction temperature
is another crucial factor in the efficient and complete hydrolysis
of hemicelluloses and cellulose. Cellulose could hardly be hydrolyzed
completely at room temperature even with a high concentration of acid
and a long reaction time. A positive reduce toward the insoluble residue
was observed when the temperature reached 95 °C. However, when
temperature was elevated to 115 °C, the local overheating also
caused carbonization of biomass and then dehydration of sugars to
HMF and/or furfural was accelerated at the high reaction temperature,
which probably leads to the formation of more humus under the acidic
condition. As shown in Figure 2c,d, increase of reaction temperature from 75 to 95 °C
led to significant reduction of the insoluble residue content from
24.45 to 16.87 wt % and increase of glucose content from 6.5 to 23.88
wt %, indicating that high temperature is conducive to remove more
carbohydrates. It is worth reminding that further elevating the temperature
to 115 or 125 °C increased the yield of insoluble residue up
to 20.34 or 21.17 wt %, which resulted from the carbonization of biomass
and the formation of humins. The color of the insoluble precipitate
became darker gradually with the extension of reaction time. Meanwhile,
the content of xylose and glucose reduced slowly. Therefore, it was
important to control the reaction time so that cellulose and hemicellulose
were hydrolyzed completely and carbonization or sugar dehydration
was avoided. As shown in Figure 1, the content of insoluble residue decreased sharply
to 16.87 wt % in 12 min and then increased slowly up to 20.15 wt %
at 20 min and 25.34 wt % at 30 min, suggesting that the majority of
cellulose and hemicellulose were removed from the biomass within 12
min. Then, the content of insoluble residue increased slowly, probably
because the carbonization of residual carbohydrates and lignin carbohydrate
complex interrelating with lignin was resistant to the dissolution
and hydrolysis due to interaction with lignin. In addition, the yield
of glucose and xylose obviously increased, but long reaction time
will cause monosaccharide dehydration and the accumulation of furans
and humins with increasing time.

of insoluble lignin (IL),
soluble lignin (SL), glucose, xylose, furfural, and HMF: HCl concentration
(a, b), reaction temperature (c, d), and reaction time (e, f) (lignocellulose:
wheat straw).

HMF and Furfural Formation
from Sugar Dehydration
During
the process, a small portion of HMF and furfural (λa = 240 nm) was generated by the dehydration of sugars, which caused
interference with lignin quantitation because of their relatively
large extinction coefficients overlap of absorbance. Therefore, it
is necessary to correct the acid-soluble lignin absorbance at 240
nm according to eq 1 1  where Abs′ is the corrected absorbance
of SL at 240 nm, and AbsT and Absf are the absorbances
of the hydrolysate and furfural/HMF at 240 nm, respectively.

Characterization
of the AZC Lignin
To prove that the
solid residue from lignocellulose is high-purity lignin by the AZC
method, the solid residue was characterized by elemental analysis,
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), FT-IR spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction
(XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM)–EDS, gel permeation
chromatography (GPC), and 2D NMR (HSQC) spectroscopy. First of all,
the solid residues were collected and characterized by a Thermo Scientific
Flash 2000 series elemental analyzer. Thermal behaviors of solid residues
were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). As shown in Figure 3, solid residues
eventually lose 97.45, 95.24, and 97.39% of their original weight
when the temperature increases up to 550 °C in air. When the
temperature reaches 350, 400, and 550 °C, the lignin residues
of rice husk, wheat straw, and bamboo powder lose their mass bluffly
until the pyrolysis was almost completed, respectively. The residual
solid was ash, whose main components were silicon and inorganic salt.
Further, the solid residues adopted two-step sulfuric acid hydrolysis
(the NREL method) to detect the trace of residual carbohydrates. As
shown in Table S2, only trace amounts of
monosaccharides were detected in the filtrate collected from hydrolysis
of different species of biomass, suggesting that carbohydrates could
be removed from biomass nearly completely through the AZC method.

and differential thermogravimetry (b) curves of lignin
isolated from various lignocelluloses.

Then, the three kinds of lignin residue generated from different
feedstock were examined by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy
with a Bruker vector-2 spectrophotometer using the KBr disk method
in the spectral range of 400–4000 cm–1. In
the structure of lignin, there are many bonds and functional groups.
Although the IR spectrum cannot detect some specific information about
each band, it can be used to speculate the structure of lignin and
can provide information about its purity. FT-IR spectra of lignin
are shown in Figure 4a, and the band assignments are summarized in Table S3. It can be concluded that the as-prepared lignin
belongs to the HSG-type lignin from the information of functional
group region. The relatively strong and broad peak at 3470 cm–1 contributes to the hydroxyl group, and the band at
1140 cm–1 is characteristic of herbal lignin, which
can be explained by the presence of the S units in lignin. Comparing
the three kinds of lignin, it can be found that their spectra were
almost identical, implying that their structures are close to each
other.15 The characteristic peaks of 2933
and 2854 cm–1 are attributed to the presence of
C–H stretching. Considering the structure of lignin, the peaks
in the range of 700–850 cm–1 can be assigned
to aromatic C–H. Typically, from 1400 to 1650 cm–1, multiple peaks for C=C stretching in aromatics rings skeleton
are observed. The presence of a peak at 1713 cm–1 verifies the C=O stretching in an α,β-unsaturated
aldehyde or carboxylic acid. In addition, the peak at 1115 cm–1 for C–O stretching was assigned to alcohols,
esters, and ethers. The molecular weight distributions of lignin were
determined by means of GPC (N,N-dimethylformamide,
DMF) analysis, and the values of the number-average (Mn) and weight-average (Mw)
molecular weights were calculated from the GPC curves (related to
polystyrene standard). As shown in Figure 4b, wheat straw lignin (WSL) and bamboo powder
lignin (BPL) exhibited similar molecular weights, 10 872 and
9642 g mol–1, respectively, and the rice husk lignin
(RHL) has a relatively lower molecular weight, which is summarized
in Table 1, as well
as the polydispersity index (Mw/Mn).

from various lignocelluloses.

Two-dimensional 1H–13C NMR (2D NMR)
techniques have been used to estimate the purity, structures, and
the main linkages of the as-prepared lignin. Although the Klason lignin
is indomitable as it is insoluble in any organic solvent, the lignin
isolated from lignocellulosic biomass using acidic zinc chloride was
found to be soluble in some organic solvents, such as N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), formic acid acid/water
(98:2, v/v), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).16 Therefore, about 50 mg of lignin was dissolved directly in 600 μL
of solvent for the 2D NMR characterization. The side chains (δC/δH
50–80/2.5–6.0) and the aromatic regions (δC/δH
100–135/5.5–8.5) of the HSQC spectra of WSL are shown
in Figure 5. It is
reported that β-O-4′ (structure A) is the predominant
type of linkage in native lignin, with small quantified contents of
β-5′ (structure B) and β–β′
(structure C) linkages.17 According to
previous publications, the amounts of β-O-4′ are about
25–40 per 100 units, and β-5′ (structure B) and
β–β′ (structure C) account for 2–5
and 7–10 per 100 units in native lignin, respectively. The
information of the interunit linkages in lignin can be obtained from
the side-chain region (δC/δH 50–90/2.5–6.0)
of WSL in the 2D-HSQC NMR spectra. As shown in Figure 5 (left), the most prominent signals correspond
to methoxy group at δC/δH 56.13/3.74 ppm and several kinds
of β-O-4′ aryl ether linkages. Among these, the Cα–Hα correlations in structures
A linking to G and S units were observed at δC/δH 71.66/4.86
and 71.82/5.13 ppm, respectively. Besides, a small signal and a relatively
large signal were identified at δC/δH 85.10/4.67 and 86.76/5.62
ppm, respectively, and the Cβ–Hβ correlations corresponding to the S-type β-O-4′ (Aβ(S)) and G-type β-O-4′ (Aβ(G)) substructures at δC/δH 85.9/4.12 and 86.8/3.99 ppm.
The Cβ–Hβ correlations of
structures B and C were overlapping with the signal of methoxy group,
and they can be discovered at δC/δH 53.15/3.80 and 53.18/3.27
ppm, respectively. The Cγ–Hγ correlations in structures A, B, and C can be distinguished at δC/δH
60.65/3.40, 63.12/3.43, and 71.66/4.08, respectively. Another signal
region is the aromatic region in Figure 5 (right), which corresponds to the aromatic
rings of guaiacyl (G), p-hydroxyphenyl (H), and syringyl
(S) units of lignin. The C2,6–H2,6 correlations
of S units were prominently observed at δC/δH 103.8/6.71
ppm, and the Cα-oxidized S units (structure S′)
showed a relatively weak signal at δC/δH 106.68/7.24 ppm.
Different correlations for the C5–H5 and
C6–H6 of G units were observed at δC/δH
113.46/6.76 and 115.37/6.66 ppm, respectively, whereas the correlations
for the C2–H2 and C6–H6 in α-ketone structures
oxidized of G units were observed at δC/δH 111.24/9.39
and 119.66/6.66 ppm, respectively. In addition, the signals for the
C2,6–H2,6 and C3,5–H3,5 correlations of substructures H were clearly observed at
δC/δH 115.37/6.66 and 128.65/7.07 ppm, respectively, in
the aromatic region of the HSQC spectrum of WSL. It should be pointed
out that the position of C3,5–H3,5 correlations
in H units overlapped with guaiacyl 5-positions.18 A little fly in the ointment is an unexpected polysaccharide
peak that was detected for the β-5 linkage at δC/δH
66.36/4.04 ppm. However, the above observations suggest that the purity
of lignin was very high and the traces of carbohydrates were negligible,
which scarcely had any effect on lignin quantitation.15,19

Figure 5 2D 1H–13C correlation (HSQC) spectra
of WSL.

In addition, wheat straw and its
lignin residue were examined by
means of SEM–EDS. As shown in Figure 6, the SEM image indicates that the fiber
and sheet structures of the original biomass disappeared and the particle
size of the lignin residue was less than 10 μm, suggesting that
carbohydrates have been removed completely from the original lignocellulose.
In addition, only a small zinc peak was observed in the energy-dispersive
spectra, indicating that there is less zinc residue. Furthermore,
the C/O molar ratio of the lignin residue was 1.83, which was similar
to the consequence of elemental analysis. These evidences indicate
that lignin with excellent purity was separated and prepared successfully.

and EDX spectra of wheat straw (a, b) and insoluble
lignin (c, d) after acidic molten salt treatment.

During the disassembly of lignocellulose, cellulose and hemicellulose
can also be efficiently degraded into relative monosaccharides, such
as glucose, xylose, etc., and their yield strongly depends on the
kind of lignocellulose. As shown in Table 2, the maximum yield of glucose can reach
up to 40% for bamboo, indicating that it is an efficient method to
prepare glucose and xylose, which are the source of various kinds
of chemicals and can also be used as nutrition if necessary. For example, they can be used
for producing HMF, furfural, hydrocarbon, and alcohols, and lignin
can also be used for producing phenols, BTX, dicarboxylic acids, and
polymers. During the disassembly processes, high-purity lignin can
be obtained with high yields (Table S4),
which can be used as feedstock of lignin for further refinery in the
near future.

Recovery and Reuse of Zinc
Chloride
There are two methods
for ZnCl2 recovery. First, ZnCl2 can be extracted
from an aqueous solution with an organic phase and is subsequently
stripped into a solution from which ammine chloride can be crystallized.
For example, ethylene glycol is employed as an organic phase and then
the mixed solution is contacted with gaseous ammonia to crystallize
zinc ammine chloride, followed by heating to recover precipitate and
remove ammonia. The second method is a simple hydrometallurgical process
for producing anhydrous zinc chloride. The zinc ammine chloride precipitation
could be easily achieved by the aqueous solution of ammonium hydroxide,
which can be obtained from the hydrolysate by filtering or centrifuging
to separate carbohydrates and zinc chloride. The structures and purity
of the recycled zinc chloride were characterized by acetic acid salt
spray test, XRD, and significant phenomenon of deliquescence in the
air. As shown in Figure 7a, the fresh and recycled zinc chloride has the same peaks at 2θ
values, indicating a successful recovery of zinc chloride with a high
recovery rate (∼86 wt %). Meanwhile, the effect of pH on the solubility of Zn(NH3)2Cl2 has been studied, and as shown in Figure 5b, when the pH value
was increased from 5 to 7, the concentration of Zn2+ significantly
reduced from 63 to 10 g L–1 and reached its lowest
point (5 g L–1) at pH = 7.5. But it began to increase
at pH = 8, indicating that excess ammonium hydroxide will lead to
the dissolution of zinc ammine chloride precipitates. Therefore, the
optimum condition to precipitate zinc ions as complete as possible
is adding ammonium hydroxide until pH = 7.5. Zinc chloride could be
recycled successfully based on these studies so that the zinc ion
pollution is avoided and a green chemical circle is achieved. Interestingly,
the recycled zinc chloride can be reused for disassembly of fresh
lignocellulose.

Conclusions
Here,
we have developed a facile one-step method to isolate lignin
from lignocellulosic biomass. Acidic zinc chloride molten salt was
used as a reaction medium, which could dissolve and hydrolyze hemicellulose
and cellulose quickly and completely, but not lignin. The optimal
reaction conditions for this method were zinc chloride molten salt
with 1.5 M HCl at 110 °C for 12 min, which ensured the complete
dissolution and hydrolysis of hemicellulose and cellulose, prevented
the carbonization of biomass, and reduced the formation of humus to
avoid the overestimation of lignin. The procedure can be finished
within 12 min, which is much shorter than the NREL method (3–6
h). In addition, this method was conducted under mild conditions.
The reaction medium (acidic zinc chloride) can be easily recycled
with no hazardous heavy-metal pollution of zinc ions. Furthermore,
the method could be applied to different species of lignocellulose,
including wheat straw, bamboo powder, and rice husk, and high-purity
lignin can be obtained with high yield of glucose and xylose, which
provides a key step to disassemble lignocellulose for green overall
utilization in the near future.

Experimental Section
Materials
Lignocellulosic biomass, including rice hull,
bamboo powder, and wheat straw, were obtained from Shandong, Anhui,
and Shanxi provinces, respectively, and their elemental contents are
listed in Table S1. Deionized water with
resistivity of 18 MΩ·cm was produced from Milli-Q water
(Millipore). Zinc chloride (ZnCl2·4H2O,
98%) was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. In addition,
analytical-grade H2SO4 (98%) and hydrochloric
acid (37%) aqueous solutions were purchased from Shanghai Chemical
Reagents Company and used directly without further purification. Other
reagents, such as chromatographic acetonitrile (99.99%), furfural
(99%), and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF, 98%), were purchased from
Aladdin Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd.

Biomass Sample Preparation
Lignocellulosic biomass,
such as rice hull, bamboo powder, and wheat straw, were washed, dried,
and smashed, and biomass powders between 40 and 80 mesh were collected.

Lignin Isolation by the AZC Method
Lignocellulosic
biomass powder (1.5 g, weighed to the nearest 0.1 mg) was mixed with
solid zinc chloride and stirred completely in a 50 mL flask. Then,
it was heated in an oil bath at 95 °C for 10–20 min under
magnetic stirring (400 rpm). Simultaneously, 5 mL of hydrochloric
acid (1.5 mol L–1) should be dropped slowly over
scheduled time. At the end of dropping, the flask was kept sealed
until the solid mixture was immersed into the liquid completely. The
mixture was agitated using a magnetic stirring bar (400 rpm) at the
preset reaction time. The reaction was quenched by cooling the reactor
by ice–water mixture. The native lignin was extracted from
the homogeneous solution through liquid–liquid extraction using
ethyl acetate. The inorganic solution was collected for the subsequent
analysis of sugars and their decomposition products by means of high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) within 6 h. All of the organic mixture
was filtered under reduced pressure. The solid residues were dried
at 85 °C overnight and then gravimetrically quantitated. Hemicellulose
and cellulose were dissolved and hydrolyzed from solid residues, leaving
lignin as an insoluble residue to be quantitated gravimetrically.
The insoluble residue (IR) was calculated using eq 1, and the insoluble lignin (IL) was calculated
using eq 2, which is
quantitated by removing the ash. Soluble lignin (SL) was quantitated
using eq 3, according
to the Beer–Lambert law on a UV–visible spectrophotometer. 2   3   4  where ms, mc+r, mc, and ma are the
oven dry weight of sample, weight
of the crucible with the insoluble solid residue, the crucible weight,
and ash weight, respectively; Abs is the average UV–vis absorbance
for the sample at the appropriate wavelength; Vf is the volume of filtrate; δ = (volume of sample +
volume of diluting solvent)/volume of sample; ε = absorptivity
of biomass at specific wavelength (25 g–1 L cm–1 for woody biomass at 240 nm and 30 g–1 L cm–1 for herbaceous biomass at 320 nm, adopted
from the NREL method); and l = path length of the
UV–vis cell in centimeters (1.0 cm).

Preparation of Monosaccharide
and Recycling of Zinc Chloride
The filtrate obtained from
the procedure of lignin isolation was
collected, and some activated carbon was added to decolorize it. Then,
the transparent filtrate was collected and ammonium hydroxide aqueous
solution was added to form precipitate of zinc chloride ammine by
controlling pH from 7 to 8. The clear transparent filtrate can be
obtained through separating the filtrate and precipitate. The mixture
of monosaccharides can be crystallized from the filtrate by standing
it for a period of time. On the other hand, the white precipitate
is extremely stable in air atmosphere and can be easily dissolved
by adding hydrochloric acid aqueous solution. Anhydrous zinc chloride
could be generated by heating in a tube furnace at 400 °C for
90 min under nitrogen atmosphere.

Klason Lignin Quantitation
by the NREL Method
Quantitation
of lignin by the two-stage sulfuric acid hydrolysis was conducted
following the NREL standard protocol. In brief, 0.3 g of biomass (weighed
to the nearest 0.1 mg) was treated in 72% H2SO4 at 30 °C for 60 min. The slurry was diluted to 4% H2SO4 and autoclaved at 121 °C for 60 min. After filtration,
the acid-insoluble lignin and the acid-soluble lignin were quantitated
gravimetrically and spectrophotometrically, respectively.

Chromatographic
Analysis
Monosaccharides in the filtrates
were quantitatively analyzed by means of high-performance ion chromatography
(HPLC) on a SHIMADZU-GL system equipped with a refractive index detector
and a general 1 M NH2 column (4.6 × 250 mm2) at 40 °C. The mixed solution of acetonitrile and deionized
water (72:28, v/v) was used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of
1.0 mL min–1. The yields of monosaccharides were
calculated from the carbon mole ratio after normalizing the monitored
concentration of products. The dehydration products (HMF and furfural)
of the monosaccharides were determined using HPLC with a Wonda Cr
act ODS-2 column (4.6 × 250 mm2) at 60 °C and
an UV–vis detector at 210 nm. The solution of 0.1% phosphoric
acid was used as the mobile phase at 1.0 mL min–1. The molecular weights of the three lignin preparations were determined
by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) on a SHIMADZU-GL system equipped
with a refractive index detector and a Shodex GPC KD-804 column at
60 °C. The lignin was dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (∼10 mg mL–1) and filtered through a 0.45 μm nylon membrane. DMF was used
as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min–1. The number-average molecular weight (Mn), weight-average molecular weight (Mw), and polydispersity index (Mw/Mn) were calculated using monodispersed polystyrene
standards.

NMR Analysis
The NMR spectra were
recorded on a Bruker
AVIII 400 MHz spectrometer equipped with a DCH cryoprobe using dimethyl
sulfoxide-d6 (DMSO-d6) as the solvent. For the 1H–13C heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) NMR spectroscopy,
around 50 mg of lignin was dissolved in 0.5 mL of DMSO-d6. The spectral widths were 12 ppm (from 11 to −1
ppm) and 220 ppm (from 200 to −20 ppm) for the 1H and 13C dimensions, respectively. The peak of solvent
(DMSO-d6) was used as a reference point
of internal chemical shift. Data of spectra were processed using the
standard Bruker Topspin-NMR software.

SEM–EDS Analysis
The morphology and elemental
distribution of the lignin residue were observed and detected by a
field emission scanning electron microscope (Leo Co., Oberkochen,
Germany) coupled with an energy-dispersive spectrometer. Lignin residue
was tightly fixed on the surface of the conductive tape stuck to the
aluminum mount and sputter-coated with a thin layer of platinum before
microscopic observation. The accelerating voltage was 10.0 kV for
morphology observation and 15.0 kV for EDS analysis.

Other Analysis
The elementary compositions of the lignin
residue were recorded by CHONS elemental analysis using the Elementar
vario EL cube at 1150 °C. The chemical structure of lignin was
examined by means of Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy
with a Bruker vector-2 spectrophotometer (Germany) using potassium
bromide (KBr) assay method in the spectral range of 400–4000
cm–1. The thermal stability of the lignin residue
was recorded by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA).
