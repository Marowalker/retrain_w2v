Heparin is a polysaccharide-based anticoagulant agent,
which is widely used in surgery and blood transfusion. However, overdosage
of heparin may cause severe side effects such as bleeding and low
blood platelet count. Currently, there is only one clinically licensed
antidote for heparin: protamine sulfate, which is known to provoke
adverse effects. In this work, we present a stable and biocompatible
alternative for protamine sulfate that is based on serum albumin,
which is conjugated with a variable number of heparin-binding peptides.
The heparin-binding efficiency of the conjugates was evaluated with
methylene blue displacement assay, dynamic light scattering, and anti-Xa
assay. We found that multivalency of the peptides played a key role
in the observed heparin-binding affinity and complex formation. The
conjugates had low cytotoxicity and low hemolytic activity, indicating
excellent biocompatibility. Furthermore, a sensitive DNA competition
assay for heparin detection was developed. The detection limit of
heparin was 0.1 IU/mL, which is well below its therapeutic range (0.2–0.4
IU/mL). Such biomolecule-based systems are urgently needed for next-generation
biocompatible materials capable of simultaneous heparin binding and
sensing.

==== Body
Introduction
Heparin is a highly charged glycosaminoglycan
(GAG) mainly composed of uronic acid and glucosamine subunits.1 Ever since its first medical use in the 1930s,
heparin has found widespread applications as the first naturally occurring
polysaccharide-based drug.2 The medical
role of heparin is primarily based on its anticoagulant ability. It
can complex with thrombin inhibitors such as antithrombin III with
high affinity. This further inactivates thrombin, factor Xa, and other
coagulation factors leading to an interrupted blood-clotting cascade.3 Commonly, the dosage of heparin needs to be maintained
within 2–8 IU/mL during cardiovascular surgery and 0.2–1.2
IU/mL in postoperative and long-term care. Maintaining heparin concentrations
at sufficient levels will prevent thrombosis while avoiding the risk
of serious side effects, including heparin-induced thrombocytopenia,
caused by excessive heparin.4−6 Hence, it is of vital importance
to monitor heparin concentrations and also neutralize its anticoagulant
effect when blood clotting needs to be recovered. Currently, heparin
neutralization is predominantly achieved by an arginine-rich shellfish
protein, protamine sulfate (PS), which is also the only clinically
licensed antidote. Anti-Xa assay and activated partial thromboplastin
time assay (aPTT) are the most desirable methods to monitor blood
coagulation.7−9

Protamine sulfate binds to heparin efficiently
through the electrostatic interaction between its cationic arginine
groups and anionic sulfonate groups of heparin.10 Despite the high binding efficiency using PS involves serious
drawbacks that should not be overlooked. For example, it can cause
severe adverse effects including anaphylactic reactions, and it is
ineffective in the removal of low molecular weight heparin.11−14 Therefore, great effort has been devoted to the development of new
heparin antidote candidates.2 Most of these
rely on the development of cationic molecules since heparin has the
highest negative charge among all known biomacromolecules.15 Methylene blue is one of the earliest and simplest
compounds that have been studied.16 However,
its binding efficiency is largely hindered in physiological conditions
due to the low charge density.17 Other
small molecular systems have also been reported, such as surfen, delparantag,
and foldamers.18−21 Owing to their multivalency effects, cationic oligopeptides,22,23 synthetic polymers,24−27 and self-assembled systems28−31 have drawn attention.

As mentioned above, another
important area in maintaining sufficient heparin levels is the detection
technique. Traditional clotting time-based assays have been proven
accurate, but they are rather time-consuming. Therefore, real-time
heparin detection methods would be highly desirable, and numerous
luminescent,32 colorimetric,33,34 and fluorescent35−38 sensors have been developed along these lines. Fluorescence-based
methods have been established using both turn-on35,37 and turn-off36 approaches.

Serum
albumin (SA) is broadly recognized as a biocompatible vector for the
delivery of drugs.39−41 In addition, many SA-based conjugates have been reported
to be nontoxic and nonimmunogenic.40,42−45 In 2005, an albumin-based anticancer drug, Abraxane, was first approved
by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and continuous effort
has been put into the development of albumin-based drugs.46,47 In this work, albumin-based heparin-binding compounds were developed.
They are based on SA proteins that are conjugated with a variable
number of heparin-binding peptides (HBPs). The heparin-binding peptide
is known from the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and has a dissociation
constant of ∼134 pM with heparin.48 Single (1SP) and multiple (3SP and 7SP) peptide-conjugated SAs were
synthesized, and the binding ability of the products to heparin was
evaluated with methylene blue (MB) displacement assay, dynamic light
scattering (DLS), and anti-Xa assay in selected buffers and human
blood plasma. It was found that the heparin-binding capacity increased
with the amount of peptides attached. Under physiological conditions,
3SP and 7SP maintained moderate heparin-binding ability, which could
be attributed to the multivalency effect,49−51 while 1SP showed
negligible heparin binding. The complexes were also visualized with
atomic force microscopy (AFM). 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) dye assay and hemolysis assay results revealed negligible
toxicity to human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) cells and human red blood
cells (RBCs) within the tested concentration range. Finally, a fluorescence-based
heparin detection method was developed through complexing 7SP and
chemically modified DNA (22 nucleotide (nt)-long DNA with a fluorescein
(6-FAM) and black hole quencher (BHQ1) at the 5′ and 3′
ends, respectively). A calibration curve for quantitative heparin
level detection was constructed, and it was found that the detection
limit is <0.1 IU/mL, which is well below the concentration required
during cardiovascular surgery (0.2–1.2 IU/mL).

Results and Discussion
Preparation of SA–Peptide Conjugates
For conjugating
SA and peptides, an efficient and selective thiol maleimide reaction
was used.52−54 Bovine serum albumin used in this work has a free
and solvent-exposed cysteine (Cys34), which acts as a suitable and
easily accessible conjugation handle.55 Additional advantages including stability, low toxicity, and long
circulation time make SA an ideal candidate as a scaffold and shielding
group for bioconjugates.45 For the preparation
of single peptide-conjugated SA (1SP), an N-terminal
maleimide-modified peptide was mixed with SA and left reacting overnight
(Figure 1a). According
to the analysis of the crude 1SP mixture with semipreparative high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a heparin affinity column (Figure S1a), the conversion was approximately
50%.56 Peak fractions were collected, desalted,
and finally lyophilized. The purity of 1SP was confirmed by matrix-assisted
laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF, Figure 1b) and HPLC (Figure 1d).

Figure 1 (a) Schematic presentation of the preparation of single
(1SP) and multiple (3SP and 7SP) peptide-modified SAs. (b) MALDI-TOF
spectra of SA and 1SP: MSA = 66,519 g/mol
and M1SP = 68,414 g/mol (theoretical molecular
weights: MSA = 66,430 g/mol57 and M1SP = 68,636
g/mol); (c) MALDI-TOF spectra of cross-linker-capped SAs: M5× = 67,502 g/mol and M10× = 68,473 g/mol. Therefore, the estimated number
of cross-linkers attached to SAs for 5 and 10 equiv syntheses was
3 and 7, respectively; (d) HPLC analysis of purified 1SP, 3SP, and
7SP using a heparin affinity column. SA was analyzed for comparison.

Free lysines on the SA surface were further used
for the synthesis of two different types of antidote: SA with approximately
three or seven peptides (3SP or 7SP). A cross-linker, di(N-succinimidyl) 3,3′-dithiodipropionate containing a disulfide
bond, was first added to SA in 5 or 10 equiv of excess. Successful
conjugation was confirmed by HPLC and MALDI-TOF, which further revealed
that the estimated number of cross-linkers attached to SA for 5 and
10 equiv syntheses was 3 and 7, respectively (Figure 1c and Figure S1b,c). Surprisingly, no cross-linked SA was observed in either reactions
(Figure S1b,d), which is most likely due
to the relatively low protein and high cross-linker concentrations.
Next, the disulfide bonds were cleaved using a reducing reagent, tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine
hydrochloride (TCEP), yielding reactive sulfhydryl groups. Excess
TCEP and cleaved cross-linkers were removed with HPLC using a desalting
column (Figure S2a,b). The reactive elution
fractions were subsequently combined with an N-maleimide-modified
HBP to yield 3SP and 7SP. From HPLC data, it was found that the conversion
in both cases was quantitative and the products were pure (Figure 1d and Figure S2c,d).

Heparin-Binding Study
Heparin-binding ability was first
evaluated using MB displacement assay in a 2 mM Tris-HCl buffer. MB
is a known heparin-binding dye with an absorbance peak at 664 nm,
which shifts to 568 nm when bound to heparin. In the presence of another
but stronger heparin-binder, MB can be displaced from heparin and
the absorbance peak at 664 nm is restored (Figure S3a). Therefore, the ratio between A (664
nm)/A (568 nm) can be used to evaluate the heparin-binding
efficiency of conjugates (Figure 2) as a function of the mass (mB/mH) or molar (nB/nH) ratios between the binder
and heparin.34 SA showed minor heparin-binding
efficiency within the tested concentration range, while that of a
pure peptide was higher but not saturated. The slight binding of SA
could be attributed to electrostatic attraction to heparin due to
the large pool of lysines on the surface.58,59 When one peptide was attached to SA (1SP), the heparin-binding ability
was significantly enhanced and saturated at a mass ratio of ∼100
equiv (∼28 equiv in the molar ratio, Figure 2). This binding efficiency is even higher
than that of plain SA or the plain peptide alone, which indicates
a synergistic effect between these two components.60 We can also conclude that the number of conjugates needed
to fully release MB was significantly reduced with the increasing
number of attached peptides. The saturation point shifts from ∼100
equiv of 1SP to ∼32 equiv of 3SP and ∼12 equiv of 7SP
(Figure 2). In Table 1, c50, the concentration required for 50% displacement of
MB from its complex, and the positive/negative charge ratio of binder/heparin
for 50% MB displacement are compared. The data indicates that all
binders achieve MB displacement at comparable ratios and 7SP showed
similar heparin-binding capacity with PS when comparing the molar
ratios.

Figure 2 MB displacement assay results in (left) mass and (right) molar ratios
of the binder to heparin, measured by the A (664
nm)/A (568 nm) ratio. Heparin concentration: 0.017
mg/mL (0.9 μM). Protamine sulfate was plotted for comparison.
Measurements were performed using triplicate samples, and the averaged
results with standard deviation are presented.

reported.29

Next, dynamic light scattering (DLS) was employed
to confirm the heparin-binding efficiency in the absence of added
electrolytes (Figure 3a,b) as well as at a physiological salt concentration (150 mM NaCl, Figure 3c,d). Heparin solutions
(0.02 mg/mL) were titrated with the conjugates, and the increased
scattering intensity (derived count rate) and hydrodynamic diameter
(Dh) were used as indicators for binding
and complex formation. In the plain buffer, the hydrodynamic diameters
of heparin titrated with SA or 1SP yielded complexes with sizes of
∼20 nm within the whole concentration range (Figure 3a). Much higher values were
recorded when heparin was titrated with 3SP or 7SP. This is expected
as the one binding site on 1SP results in complex coacervate core
micelles, while the multiple binding sites on 3SP and 7SP can cross-link
with heparin and therefore form larger complexes.61 As for the derived count rate, solutions titrated with
PS, 3SP, and 7SP increased sharply at the low mass ratios and decreased
after a certain mass ratio was reached (Figure 3b), which is a typical phenomenon when oppositely
charged polyelectrolytes are complexed.62 These peaks indicate a neutral charge balance, and they agree well
with the saturation points obtained from the MB displacement assay.

Figure 3 Titration
of heparin (0.02 mg/mL) with binders (a, b) in the 2 mM Tris-HCl buffer
and (c, d) at the physiological salt concentration (2 mM Tris-HCl,
150 mM NaCl) was monitored with DLS. The hydrodynamic diameter (a,
c) and derived count rate (b, d) were used as indicators for the successful
complexation. Titrations were performed using triplicate samples,
and the averaged results with standard deviation are presented. (e)
Peak force tapping mode AFM images (insets show the peak force error
scale) of heparin neutralized with (1, 3) 3SP (mB/mH = 40) and (2, 4) 7SP (mB/mH = 15) in the
presence of 0 mM (1, 2) and 150 mM (3, 4) NaCl. The corresponding
DLS samples have been marked on the data.

At the physiologically relevant salt concentration,
the binding affinities of all compounds were slightly weakened because
of the shielding effect of counter ions.51 Nevertheless, both hydrodynamic diameter values and derived count
rates remained high for heparin complexes formed with 3SP or 7SP (Figure 3c,d).63 SA and 1SP showed a small increase in the count
rate and no change in size, indicating minor complex formation with
heparin at these conditions. The free peptide presented heparin-binding
ability in the Tris-HCl buffer, as indicated by the increased diameter
and count rate, but the binding was not observed in the presence of
150 mM NaCl (Figure S4).

The morphologies
of heparin complexed with 3SP and 7SP were directly visualized with
AFM (Figure 3e and Figure S5). Both complexes were well dispersed
on the silica surface and adopted roughly spherical morphologies with
sizes up to ∼1 μm. No obvious size change was observed
in buffers with or without NaCl. The size of the complexes observed
with AFM is slightly smaller than with DLS, which could be attributed
to drying and consequent shrinking of the complexes.64

Finally, in vitro heparin neutralization efficiency
was evaluated in plasma using a chromogenic anti-Xa assay (Figure 4). Again, it can
be observed that the neutralization efficiency increased with the
number of conjugated peptides. SA and 1SP showed negligible neutralization
efficiency, which is consistent with the DLS results in 150 mM NaCl.
Compared to SA and 1SP, 3SP and 7SP showed much better performance.
3SP reached as high as 60% neutralization at ∼50 equiv, while
7SP showed full heparin neutralization at ∼25 equiv.

Figure 4 Heparin neutralization
measured with the anti-Xa assay in plasma. Experiments were performed
using triplicate samples, and the averaged results with standard deviation
are presented.

Combining all the results from the binding assays,
we found that the SA conjugated with multiple peptides (3SP and 7SP)
showed significant multivalency effects, leading to excellent heparin-binding
ability. 7SP showed better performance than that of PS when comparing
the molar ratios, which underlines the potential of 7SP to substitute
PS. On the other hand, the heparin-binding capacity of unmodified
SA and the peptide was only moderate in the Tris-HCl buffer and negligible
at the physiological salt concentration. When the two components were
conjugated in a 1:1 ratio (1SP), significant enhancement was achieved
but only in the absence of added electrolytes and plasma. Considering
that there are 30–35 lysines available for modification on
the SA surface, it is foreseeable that even more efficient heparin
binders could be achieved through further optimization.

Biocompatibility Study
The biocompatibility of conjugates,
pure PS, and heparin was first studied with an MTT cell viability
assay. Human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) cells were incubated for 4,
14, or 24 h with the free compounds (PS, heparin, HBP, SA, 1SP, 3SP,
and 7SP) and the same components complexed with heparin. As can be
observed from Figure 5 and Figure S6, SA and heparin did not
induce any decrease in cell viability at 100 μg/mL after 24
h of incubation. Increased cytotoxicity was observed with PS as the
incubation time and concentration increased: the cell viability dropped
to 50% after 24 h of incubation (100 μg/mL PS). The free peptide
followed a similar trend, but the drop at 100 μg/mL was not
as drastic as in the case of PS. For 1SP, no toxicity was observed.
However, when the number of peptides conjugated to SA was increased,
cell viability decreased with the increasing concentration and incubation
time. In general, 3SP and 7SP showed similar influence on fibroblasts
as PS. When 1 μg/mL (∼0.2 IU/mL) heparin was first neutralized
by the compounds and subsequently incubated with fibroblasts, only
minor toxicity was observed (Figure 5).

Figure 5 Effect of the heparin binders on cell viability evaluated
with MTT assay using HDF cells. (left) Cells were incubated with free
binders at four concentrations for 24 h. (right) Heparin of 1 μg/mL
was first neutralized by binders and then incubated with the cells
for 4, 14, or 24 h. Measurements were performed using triplicate samples,
and the averaged results with standard deviation are presented.

Aside from MTT assay, hemolysis assay was utilized
to evaluate biocompatibility of the studied compounds under application-relevant
conditions. Since heparin has been widely used in both surgery and
blood transfusion, it is of vital importance to assess the influence
of the heparin-binding conjugates on the stability of RBCs.65,66 Hemolysis data in Figure 6 shows that the conjugates induced negligible hemolysis on
RBCs up to 100 μg/mL. When 5 μg/mL (1.1 IU/mL) heparin
was first fully neutralized by 3SP or 7SP and thereafter incubated
with RCBs, no noticeable hemolysis was observed. Combining the hemolysis
and MTT assay results, we can conclude that the biocompatibility of
the SA–peptide conjugates is comparable to that of the commercial
PS.

Figure 6 Hemolysis assay with RBCs; results indicate that both (a) binders
alone and (b) binder–heparin (5 μg/mL) complexes cause
negligible red blood cell hemolysis. Solutions of 1× phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) and 1% Triton X-100 were used as the negative and positive
control, respectively. Measurements were performed using triplicate
samples, and the averaged results with standard deviation are presented.

Switch-On Heparin Detection
With the help of a dye-modified
DNA oligonucleotide and the 7SP, we were able to design a detection
system for ultralow amounts of heparin. A non-self-complementary 22
nt-long DNA sequence (0.2 μM), modified with a fluorescent dye
(6-FAM) at the 5′ end and a quencher dye (BHQ1) at the 3′
end, was first complexed with 7SP through electrostatic interactions.
This led to a significant drop in 6-FAM fluorescence intensity due
to formation of the complex where both dyes are at close proximity
(blue squares in Figure 7). It was found that the maximum quenching effect was reached at
9 μg/mL 7SP already, resulting in roughly one-sixth of the initial
fluorescence intensity (FL, off). When heparin was introduced, DNA
in the 7SP–DNA complex was replaced with heparin owing to the
high binding efficiency between heparin and 7SP, yielding free unbound
DNA strands and 7SP–heparin complexes. As a result, the fluorescence
intensity increased as a function of heparin concentration (orange
triangles in Figure 7). It can be observed that, within the range of 0–5.5 μg/mL
heparin, the fluorescence intensity rises almost linearly with respect
to the increasing heparin concentration. The initial fluorescence
level is regained at 5.5 μg/mL (FL, on), showing that quantitative
detection of heparin is feasible with this system. Moreover, the detection
limit reaches 0.5 μg/mL (∼0.1 IU/mL), which is well below
the lowest therapeutic level (0.2 IU/mL), thus making the 7SP–DNA
complex a highly sensitive heparin detector.4−6 In addition,
the selectivity of the detector complex toward heparin was compared
to two other GAG analogues, hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate
(Figure S7). As expected, in the same concentration
range, no clear fluorescence change was observed with chondroitin
sulfate, while hyaluronic acid showed only a moderate increase (∼2-fold
enhancement). Plausibly, this difference in the obtained fluorescence
changes can be attributed to the charge densities as the charge density
of the hyaluronic acid is higher than that of chondroitin sulfate.
Nevertheless, according to these results, the detector complex is
very selective toward heparin (∼6-fold fluorescence enhancement
with heparin and only ∼2-fold enhancement with hyaluronic acid).

7SP–DNA complex. Blue squares (on the left-hand side) show
the titration of 0.2 μM DNA with 7SP. Orange triangles (on the
right-hand side) show the fluorescence recovered upon adding heparin
to the solution of the 7SP–DNA complex. The insets show schematic
steps of the process. Titrations were performed using triplicate samples,
and the averaged results with standard deviation are presented.

Conclusions
In this study, we expanded the application
space of SA to heparin binding. Assays showed that the heparin-binding
ability of the three heparin neutralizers kept mounting as the number
of conjugated peptides increased (7SP > 3SP > 1SP). 3SP and
7SP exhibited excellent binding affinity in both the buffer and blood
plasma. All SA–peptide conjugates as well as conjugate–heparin
complexes showed low or negligible cytotoxicity to HDF cells in application-relevant
concentrations. Additionally, hemolysis assay results indicated that
no hemolysis was induced on RBCs even with high conjugate concentrations
(0.1 mg/mL). Finally, with the help of a dye complex containing 7SP
and FAM- and BHQ-modified DNA, we were able to quantitatively detect
heparin down to 0.1 IU/mL, which is well below the lower limit of
clinically relevant dosage. In summary, all obtained results indicate
that these multifunctional (neutralization/detection) biomolecule-based
heparin binders are promising alternatives to the commercially available
PS, which is arguably efficient but rather contentious due to its
adverse effects.

Experimental Section
SA–Peptide Conjugate Synthesis
For the syntheses
of 1SP, 1.6 mg (0.72 μmol) of an N-terminal
maleimide-modified peptide (sequence: KME KKL HAV PAA KTV KFK, GenScript)
was mixed with 40 mg (0.6 μmol) of SA (1.2:1 in a molar ratio)
in 1 mL of a 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer and let
to react overnight. The crude product was purified with HPLC using
a HiTrap Heparin HP 5 mL column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, elution
buffers: buffer A: 10 mM PB buffer, pH 6.0 and buffer B: 10 mM PB
buffer, 300 mM NaCl, pH 6.0). The collected fraction was concentrated
and dialyzed against Milli-Q water for three days (dialysis tubing
cellulose membrane, molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) of 14 kDa, Sigma-Aldrich).
The final product was lyophilized, weighed, and dissolved in Milli-Q
water for further use.

For the synthesis of 3SP and 7SP, 5 μmol
(5×) and 10 μmol (10×) of di(N-succinimidyl)
3,3′-dithiodipropionate in 100 μL of dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) were added to 900 μL of PBS buffer solutions containing
1 μmol (66 mg) of SA. These solutions were kept at room temperature
overnight. The successful attachment of cross-linkers was determined
by HPLC and MALDI-TOF. Before peptide conjugation, 0.3 μmol
of each cross-linker-capped SA was first washed three times with PBS
using centrifugal filters with an MWCO of 10 kDa (Amicon Ultra). Thirty
and 60 μmol of tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP)
(20×× cross-linker, respectively) in 500 μL PBS were
added to reduce dithiols. Afterward, the solutions were desalted with
a HiTrap desalting column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, elution buffer:
Milli-Q water). Collected fractions were immediately mixed with 1.5
μmol (5×) and 3 μmol (10×) of the N-maleimide-modified peptide and let to react overnight. After the
reaction, crude products were purified with HPLC using a HiTrap Heparin
HP 5 mL column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, elution buffers: buffer
A: 10 mM PB buffer, pH 6.0; buffer B: 10 mM PB buffer, 1 M NaCl, pH
6.0.). Collected fractions were concentrated and dialyzed against
Milli-Q water for three days (dialysis tubing cellulose membrane,
MWCO of 14 kDa, Sigma-Aldrich). Final products were lyophilized, weighed,
and dissolved in Milli-Q water for further use.

Methylene Blue (MB) Displacement Assay
Eighty microliters
of 0.013 mg/mL MB was first mixed with 20 μL of 0.1 mg/mL heparin
in a 2 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.3. Different concentrations of compounds
in 20 μL in volume were added to the MB/heparin solution and
allowed to equilibrate for 5 min on a shaker. Next, absorption spectra
of the samples (400–750 nm) were measured with a BioTek Cytation
3-microplate reader in a 96-well plate at room temperature. The absorbance
intensity ratio A (664 nm)/A (568
nm) was used to determine the heparin-binding ability. Measurements
were performed using triplicate samples.

Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) Measurement
DLS measurements
were carried out with a Zetasizer Nano ZS device (Malvern Instruments)
with a 4 mW He–Ne ion laser at the wavelength of 633 nm and
an Avalanche photodiode detector at an angle of 173°. Zetasizer
software (Malvern Instruments) was used to attain the data. Cumulant
analysis was used to obtain the intensity mean value of the complex
size, that is, the hydrodynamic diameter. Experiments were carried
out at 25 °C. Heparin solutions were prepared by diluting 10
mg/mL heparin stock solution to 0.02 mg/mL in 0.3 mL of the buffer.
The heparin solutions were titrated with 2 μL of sample solutions
(different compound concentrations) resulting in total sample volumes
of 20 μL. Measurements were carried out in 2 mM Tris-HCl buffer
at pH 7.3 with 0 and 150 mM NaCl. After every addition, the samples
were allowed to equilibrate for 1 min. Each titration series was carried
out three times, and all titration points were measured three times.

Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) Imaging/Measurement
AFM
imaging was carried out with Dimension Icon (Bruker) in the ScanAsyst
Fluid mode. To prepare the samples for imaging, 15–20 μL
of the sample solution (heparin at 0.1 mg/mL) was incubated on a freshly
cleaved mica surface for 5 min and allowed to dry. Then, ∼250
μL of the corresponding buffer (2 mM Tris–HCl with or
without 150 mM NaCl) was carefully pipetted on the mica to form a
meniscus between the AFM scanner and sample surface. During the imaging,
the tip scanning velocity was limited to 2–5 μm/s to
minimize the drifting of the particles on surface caused by the probe.
The images were taken in 256 × 256 resolution, processed, and
exported with NanoScope Analysis software ver. 1.9 (Bruker).

Anti-Xa Assay
Heparin neutralization with compounds
in plasma was evaluated using a commercial two-stage kit, BiophenTM
Anti-Xa (221005). Conjugates of different concentrations were first
lyophilized and redissolved in human plasma. Dissolved compounds were
then added to the heparin solution in 150 mM NaCl (0.1 mg/mL), giving
a final heparin concentration of 0.075 IU/mL and compound/heparin
ratios similar to those of the MB replacement assay and DLS measurement.
Kit reagents were utilized according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. To run the calorimetric assay, 40 μL of the sample
solution was added to a 96-well microplate followed by the addition
of 40 μL of antithrombin and incubation for 2 min. Then, 40
μL of factor Xa was added and incubated for another 2 min. Afterward,
40 μL of the factor Xa-specific chromogenic substrate was added
to the solution and let to react for 2 min. Finally, the reaction
was quenched by introducing 80 μL of 2% citric acid. The absorbance
at 405 nm was recorded immediately using a BioTek Cytation 3-microplate
reader. The anticoagulant activity is inversely proportional to the
measured absorption intensity, and the percentage of neutralization
was determined using a calibration curve constructed according to
the manufacturer’s instructions (Figure S8). Measurements were performed using triplicate samples.

Cell Culture and MTT Assay
Human dermal fibroblasts
(HDF) cells (Gibco) were purchased from Fisher Scientific. The cells
were then expanded in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM)
substituted with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 U/mL penicillin
and 100 μg/mL streptomycin. The cells were kept in humidified
conditions with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Once reached the
90% confluency the cells were split using 0.25% ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA)-trypsin. Cell passages between 3 and 5 were used for the
cell culture studies. Before MTT assay, cells were split into 96-well
culture plates (approximately 10,000 cells/well) and incubated for
24 h. After the incubation, the culture media was replaced with 100
μL of compound solutions (0.1–100 μg/mL) or compound/heparin
complex solutions in DMEM supplemented with 100 U/mL penicillin and
100 μg/mL streptomycin. Based on the DLS data, the amount of
PS, 3SP, and 7SP was chosen to fully neutralize heparin, while the
highest mass ratios were used for HBP, SA, and 1SP (PS = 2 μg/mL,
HBP = 5 μg/mL, SA = 140 μg/mL, 1SP = 140 μg/mL,
3SP = 40 μg/mL, 7SP = 15 μg/mL, and heparin = 1 μg/mL).
The cells were then kept in humidified conditions with 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 4, 14, or 24 h. After that, the sample solutions
in each well were replaced with 100 uL of complete media and 10 uL
of MTT solution (5 mg/mL in PBS). After 4 h of incubation at 37 °C
with 5% CO2, the MTT solution was replaced with 100 μL
DMSO in each well to dissolve formazan crystals before reading. The
absorbance was measured with a microplate reader (Cytation 3, BioTek)
at the wavelength of 570 nm. Measurements were carried out using triplicate
samples.

Hemolysis Assay
The detailed procedure for the hemolysis
assay has been previously reported.67 Generally,
freshly donated human red blood cells were purchased (Cambridge Bioscience
Ltd., the United Kingdom) and stored at 4 °C. Before samples
were added, 1 mL of blood was centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min and the plasma was removed gently. The remaining red blood
cells were washed with 1× PBS three times and redispersed to
the initial volume in 1× PBS. The red blood cells were diluted
50× and split into 96-well culture plates (190 μL/well).
The concentrated sample (10 μL) or compound/heparin solutions
in 1× PBS were added to each well, resulting in the desired final
compound concentrations (25–100 μg/mL) or compound/heparin
complex concentrations (PS = 10 μg/mL, HBP = 25 μg/mL,
SA = 700 μg/mL, 1SP = 700 μg/mL, 3SP = 200 μg/mL,
7SP = 75 μg/mL, and heparin = 5 μg/mL; based on the DLS
data, the amount of PS, 3SP, and 7SP was chosen to fully neutralize
heparin, while the highest mass ratios were used for HBP, SA, and
1SP). Ten microliters of 20% Triton X-100 in 1× PBS and 10 μL
of 1× PBS were added as positive and negative controls, respectively.
After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, the plates were centrifuged
for 5 min at 500 × g to pellet intact erythrocytes,
and 100 μL of the supernatant from each well was delicately
transferred into a clear 96-well plate. The resulting hemoglobin in
the supernatant was measured at 540 nm with a microplate reader (Cytation
3, Biotek). The percentage of hemolysis was calculated as follows:

%Hemolysis = [(Asample – Anegative control)/(Apositive control – Anegative control)] × 100

The measurements were performed using triplicate
samples.

Switch-On Heparin Detection
The quenching effect of
7SP on FAM- and BHQ- modified 22 nt DNA was evaluated by titrating
0.2 μM DNA with 0–9 μg/mL 7SP in 2 mM Tris-HCl
buffer. The fluorescence intensity stabilized after 9 μg/mL
7SP. For the heparin replacement assay, 0.2 μM DNA was first
quenched with 9 μg/mL 7SP, which was followed by the titration
of heparin.
