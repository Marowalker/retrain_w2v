Interaction
between negatively charged liposomes and cationic polyamidoamine
dendrimers of different generations was investigated through size,
zeta potential, turbidity, electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy,
fluorescence spectroscopy, and calorimetric studies. Liposomes with
the binary combination of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine
(DPPC) + dihexadecyl phosphate, DPPC + 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol, DPPC + 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate, and DPPC + 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanol were stable up to 60 days. The electrostatic
nature of dendrimer–lipid bilayer interaction was evidenced
through charge neutralization and subsequent reversal upon added dendrimer
to liposome. Dendrimer–liposome interaction depended on its
generation (5 > 4 > 3) in addition to the charge, head groups,
and
hydrocarbon chain length of lipids. Fluorescence anisotropy and differential
scanning calorimetry studies suggest the fluidization of the bilayer,
although the surface rigidity was enhanced by the added dendrimers.
Thermodynamic parameters of the interaction processes were evaluated
by isothermal titration and differential scanning calorimetric studies.
The binding processes were exothermic in nature. The enthalpy of transition
of the chain melting of lipids decreased systematically with increasing
dendrimer concentration and generation. Dendrimer–liposome
aggregates were nontoxic to healthy human blood cell, suggesting the
potential of such aggregates as drug delivery systems.

1 Introduction
All
living cells have membrane bilayers; besides the subcellular
components such as mitochondria and Golgi bodies also possess the
lipid bilayer structures.1 Because of their
easy manifestation and ready flexibility in nature, liposomes have
received substantial considerations because of the simplified version
of cell membrane. Physicochemistry of liposomes depends on its constituents
(head group charge, head group moiety, and hydrocarbon chain length),
intra-/intermolecular interactions, and the environmental conditions.2,3 Thus, biophysical correlates on the composition, function, and structure
of membrane bilayer structure in understanding the function of cell
membranes are considered to be relevant. Reports on the interaction
studies between dendrimers and liposomes are fragmentary in nature;
no comprehensive and systematic studies have been done previously
to assess the impact of dendrimer generation, concentration, and the
variation of the liposome type.

Dendrimers are synthetically
prepared hyperbranched macromolecules
with huge number of active termini that describe their properties
and functions.4,5 Because of perfect branching,
dendrimers have the maximum number of terminal functionalities among
any polymeric material at a given molecular weight and are perfectly
monodispersed. Dendrimers, compared to the corresponding linear polymers,
possess architectural advantages in terms of drug delivery: (i) reproducible
pharmacokinetic behavior (having monodispersity);10 (ii) globular shape (provides superior biological and rheological
properties);6,7 and (iii) controlled multivalency
that can attach several molecules such as drugs, imaging agents, cell-penetrating
peptides, targeting groups, and solubilizing moieties.4,8−10

Natural cell membranes carry the overall negative
charge with a
bland of lipids. However, the preference of a mixture of lipids over
the individual components (where lipids mixtures exhibit superior
performance than single components) by nature is still not completely
understood. It is, therefore, worthwhile to investigate the physicochemistry
of lipid mixtures whereby the anionic components could be varied.
1,2-Dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine
(DPPC) is a naturally occurring zwitterionic phospholipid found in
pulmonary surfactant. It can achieve high surface pressure upon compression
at the air–liquid interface; however, being solid in nature,
it is unable to get fluidized by its own upon expansion. To maintain
parity in terms of charge, 30 mol % phosphatidyl glycerol is present
in the pulmonary surfactant. Such a combination of lipid mixtures
is also capable of forming liposomes with a net negative charge. With
the intention to mimic these combinations, we have formulated a variety
of liposomes, whereby 30 mol % anionic lipids were separately used
in combination with DPPC. The anionic lipids used herein include dihexadecyl
phosphate (DHP), 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol
(DMPG), 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (DPP),
and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho ethanol
(DPPEth). DHP lipid is different from other phospholipids even though
it can form stable liposome.11,12 Phosphatidyl alcohols
are highly potent promoters of membrane curvature, and their transbilayer
movement is three times higher than any naturally occurring phospholipid
at physiological pH.2,13 Although the aforementioned anionic
lipids (except DMPG) are not directly relevant to biological cell
membranes, however, it is expected that such a combination of lipids
in the form of liposome can be explored as antimicrobial drug delivery
systems (DDSs),14 if they are used in combination
with dendrimers.11,15,16 Cholesterol, another component of cell membrane, modulates its fluidity/rigidity.
Cholesterol (30 mol %) was used for each combination along with the
other lipids in the present set of studies. It is known that the most
active compounds (drug molecule) cannot attain therapeutical efficacy
because of their inability to reach the target side by crossing the
cell membrane barrier. To overcome this constraint, the interactions
between dendrimers with liposomes are carried out. The present sets
of liposomes with negative charge are expected to be biocompatible.
Here, the liposomes are expected to act as a drug carrier or, more
generally, as a platform for theranostics.11,15,16

Disruption of membrane bilayer with
added linear or coiled polymer
peptides or detergents occurs through interfacial adsorption on the
membrane.17−19 Because of the differences in the type and nature
of interaction, studies involving dendrimer–lipid bilayers
are in the ascendance. Oppositely charged dendrimers can create holes
in the lipid bilayer or can be incorporated into lipid aggregates.20,21 Charge and size mainly govern the strength of dendrimer function.22 Positively charged dendrimers interact more
effectively with cell membranes or other model bilayer carrying net
negative charge because of obvious reasons. Since the first successful
production of poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimer in the mid-1980s,23,24 dendrimers have received significant attention. In particular, biomedical
applications of dendrimers in various medical and pharmaceutical fields
include drug delivery, gene transfection, nanoscale drug, and diagnostic
tools. Such systems have been regarded as highly promising and have
drawn eminent interest and studies. The possibility to introduce several
functionalities has opened the door for their applications in theranostics.
Dendrimers usually cross cell membrane barriers by endocytosis; thus,
they are entrapped in endosomes.1,25 The translocation mediated
by PAMAM dendrimers in combination with liposomes are considered as
promising drug delivery systems (DDSs). Although the mechanism of
spontaneous translocation of dendrimers through the bilayers are yet
not properly understood; such studies can motivate changes in the
bilayer structure, which need to be taken into account in designing
the DDSs.23,24 The phenomenon of dendrimer-mediated cell
membrane crossing needs the understanding of its interactions with
lipid bilayers. Liposomes are the ideal model systems because of their
simple and membrane-like arrangement, easy preparation, biocompatibility,
biodegradability, and satisfactory stability above time.4,26 Some dendrimers can interact with lipids through hydrophobic interactions
that exist between the lipid acyl chains and the hydrophobic dendrimer
interior. Strength of the interaction also depends on the size and
head group of the lipid molecule.11,12,27

Adsorption of dendrimer on liposome surface
and the formation of
dendrimer–liposome aggregates are some of the most common aspects
of dendrimer–liposome interaction. Dendrimers can act as “glue”
for oppositely charged liposomes.28 Most
of the studies have focused on the interactions between positively
charged dendrimers and cell membranes because greater interaction
potency is expected in comparison with other neutral or negatively
charged dendrimers. Physicochemical properties of dendrimers influencing
the dendrimer–lipid bilayer interaction include the dendrimer
type, generation, and surface charge as well as the composition of
the lipid bilayer. Prevalence of electrostatic interaction can be
evaluated through the zeta potential (Z.P.) measurements. Calorimetric
studies on liposome and dendrimers can lead to the evaluation of thermodynamic
parameters of the interaction process such as the chain melting temperature
(Tm), width of the chain melting peak
(T1/2), enthalpy change of the chain melting
process (ΔH), heat capacity change (ΔCP), and binding constant (K). Such studies can shed light on the effect of the PAMAM dendrimer–liposome
aggregates. Size, turbidity, electron microscopy [transmission electron
microscopy (TEM)/freeze-fracture TEM (FF-TEM)/cryogenic TEM], atomic
force microscopy (AFM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), fluorescence
spectroscopy, and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements
are the effective tools to elucidate the dendrimer–liposome
interactions to elaborate the design of new DDSs that consist of dendrimers
incorporating bioactive molecules.

Different modes of interactions
between dendrimers and liposomes
are reported in the literature. The talent of PAMAM dendrimers in
forming aggregates with liposomes carrying a net negative charge is
expected to enlighten how dendrimers act as drug delivery vehicles
across the cell membrane. Dendrimers can either pass through the lipid
bilayer or form dendrimer–lipid aggregates. Some dendrimers
can interact with lipids by hydrophobic interactions between the lipid
acyl chains and the hydrophobic dendrimer interior. The strength of
the interaction mainly depends on the size and charge of the molecule.
Ultimately, the formation of dendrimer–liposome aggregates
or complex will be used as new DDSs.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 DLS and Turbidity Studies
2.1.1 Characterization of Liposomes
Hydrodynamic
diameter (dh), polydispersity index (PDI),
and Z.P. of four different liposomes (DHP + DPPC), (DMPG + DPPC),
(DPP + DPPC), and (DPPEth + DPPC) were measured at pH 7.4 as a function
of time by dynamic light scattering. DHP, DMPG, DPP, and DPPEth are
all negatively charged phospholipids, whereas DPPC is zwitterionic
with the phosphocholine head group. The formation of stable liposome
depends on the hydrophobicity of the chain and the hydrophilic nature
of the lipid head group. In the case of DPPC, the quaternary ammonium
group showed a hydrophilic nature, and palmitoyl group is hydrophobic
in nature for the bilayer formation. Data for DPPEth + DPPC are shown
in Figure 1 whereas
some other results are shown in Figure S1 (Supporting Information section). Initial constriction in size, followed
by its increase with increasing time (up to 5–18 days), were
due to the structural reorganization of the lipidic components.37 The size remained almost constant up to 60 days
for all of the systems, indicating their substantial stability.

Figure 1 Variation in
the hydrodynamic diameter (dh), PDI (line
graphs), and Z.P. of DPPETh + DPPC liposomes
with time. Cholesterol (30 mol %) was used in each case. DPPEth/DPPC
lipid ratio is 3:7 (M/M). Line graph indicates PDI values. Temperature:
25 °C. Phospholipid concentration: 0.1 mM.

Lower PDI values support monodispersity of the formulations.30,38 The size of the liposome depends on the lateral packing of lipid
molecules within the membrane bilayer and is mainly governed by the
van der Waals interactions between the hydrocarbon chains.4,12dh values for DHP + DPPC liposome, higher
than other liposomes (DMPG + DPPC, DPP + DPPC, and DPPEth + DPPC),
are due to the fact that the fraction of the head group region of
higher density decreases with increasing hydrocarbon-chain length.39,40 DHP has two hexadecyl groups which are directly connected with the
phosphate group. Thus, the hydrophobicity of DHP lipid is higher than
the other lipids and showed a maximum size in DHP + DPPC liposome.
DMPG differs from other lipids in their head group and tail group.
In case of DMPG, it contains lesser number of (14, myristoyl) methylene
hydrocarbon chains than other phospholipids (16, palmitoyl and hexadecyl
groups). Thus, the hydrophobicity of the tail group is lower than
other lipids. On the other hand, because of presence of glycerol moiety
in the head group, it forms stronger hydrogen bonding with neighbor
molecules in aqueous solution. Thus, the size of DMPG + DPPC liposome
is lower than other systems. This may be explained as a consequence
of the orientation of polar head groups to compensate the close packing
imposed by the lateral stronger van der Waals interactions of the
acyl hydrocarbon chains. The PDI values follow the sequence DPPEth
+ DPPC > DMPG + DPPC > DPP + DPPC > DHP + DPPC.

The
phosphate group in DHP is directly connected to the long hydrocarbon
chains, which strongly pushes the electron toward the phosphate group
and enhances the electron density. Hence, the Z.P. of DHP + DPPC liposome
is higher than other systems. In case of DPP and DPPEth lipids, with
the same kind of dipalmitoyl groups, unlike DPPEth (phosphatidyl alcohol),
where the phosphate group is directly connected to −CH2CH3 group, it generates greater positive inductive
effect. Hence, the Z.P. of DPPEth + DPPC liposome is higher than that
of DPP + DPPC liposome but not higher than DHP. On the other hand,
DMPG has two myristoyl groups and also the phosphate group directly
connected with a glycerol moiety.39,41 At the same
time, the hydroxyl group of glycerol moiety forms hydrogen bond with
the phosphate group of DPPC or neighboring DMPG moiety in aqueous
medium. Effectively, the enhancement of electron density on the phosphate
group in DMPG is less pronounced than the other systems; hence, the
magnitude of the Z.P. is lower in the case of DMPG + DPPC liposome.
The Z.P. for different liposome follows the sequence DHP + DPPC >
DPPEth + DPPC > DPP + DPPC > DMPG + DPPC (Figures 1 and S1).

2.2 Impact of Dendrimer on Liposome
Interaction
between dendrimers and liposomes can be assessed by the turbidity
measurements. Figure 2 (panel A) shows the concentration effect of different-generation
PAMAM dendrimers on the turbidity (τ), size (dh), and Z.P. of (DPPEth + DPPC) liposome as a representative.
Turbidity values of the dendrimer–liposome complexes pass through
maxima, likewise the size after a threshold dendrimer concentration.32 Initial size or turbidity increment and the
attainment of maxima are due to the aggregation of liposomes assisted
by dendrimers.32 Dendrimers, being oppositely
charged, adsorb on to the liposome surface.27 The decrease in size and turbidity upon further addition of dendrimers
was due to the formation of water-soluble dendrimer–liposome
aggregates.28,32 The ability in imparting turbidity
or size enhancement depends on the dendrimer generation. PAMAM dendrimers
follow the order 5G > 4G > 3G while considering the size and
turbidity
variation. There are 128, 64, and 32 end groups in the 5G, 4G, and
3G PAMAM dendrimers, respectively. With increasing dendrimer generation,
the number of end groups increases and hence lesser number of dendrimers
are required for an effective interaction. It is, therefore, reasonable
to consider the dendrimer activity in terms of the end groups’
concentration, as shown in Figure S2 (Supporting Information section). The activity of dendrimer was independent
of dendrimer generation while the end groups were taken into account.
Earlier reports reveal that the activities follow the opposite trend Glower generation > Ghigher generation.32 The
lower
the generation, the higher number of end groups become accessible
for effective interactions. With increasing dendrimer generation,
the end groups tend to back fold.32 Thus,
for higher generation dendrimers, lesser number of end groups could
effectively participate in the interaction process.

Figure 2 Effect of PAMAM dendrimer
generation: (■, 3G; ●,
4G and ▲, 5G) on the turbidity (A1), size (dh, A2), and Z.P. (A3) of (DPPEth + DPPC) liposome and
the effect of 4G dendrimer on the turbidity (B1), size (B2), and Z.P.
(B3) of different liposomes (□, DHP + DPPC; ○, DMPG
+ DPPC; △, DPP + DPPC; and ▽, DPPEth + DPPC). Cholesterol
(30 mol %) was used in each case. Phospholipid concentration: 0.1
mM.

In addition to the dendrimer generation,
the extent of interaction
also depended on the lipid composition. Dendrimer–liposome
complex is stable because of strong electrostatic interactions and
hydrogen bonding between amine end groups of dendrimer and the phosphate
moiety of the anionic lipids.3,42 As DHP shows higher
negative Z.P., it requires higher amount of dendrimer in achieving
the threshold concentration. Thus, the interaction between dendrimer
and DHP + DPPC liposome was less sensitive than other systems. Although
considering the head groups’ bulkier nature with respect to
palmitoyl group for each lipids (except DHP, dihexadecyl group), the
size of the group follows the order DMPG > DPPEth > DPP [DMPG,
−CH2CH(OH)CH2OH; DPP, −H and DPPEth,
−CH2CH3]. Although initially DMPG + DPPC
liposome was
smaller than the other systems, it’s size increased with increasing
the dendrimer concentration significantly, higher than the other liposomes
because of stronger hydrogen bonding of a glycerol group with positively
charged PAMAM dendrimers and glycerol moiety or phosphate group of
DMPG.2,39,43 Thus, the
DMPG + DPPC liposome displays stronger interactions with dendrimers
than other liposomes. On the other hand, DPPEth comprising liposomes
was more sensitive toward dendrimer than other liposomes because of
the presence of −CH2CH3 group, which
is directly connected with the phosphate group.2 Interactions between the negatively charged liposome surface
and positively charged dendrimers were further explored by Z.P. measurements.
Representative results are summarized in panel A3 and B3 of Figure 2. Magnitude of the
negative Z.P. decreased with the dendrimer concentration, and there
occurred charge reversal upon further addition of dendrimers.32,44 Further increase in Z.P. toward the positive direction suggests
the formation of nonstoichiometric aggregates, indicating the saturation
point. The post-stoichiometric aggregation is governed by hydrogen
bonding and/or hydrophobic interaction induced by amine groups. It
was observed that the other liposome combinations also interacted
strongly with the dendrimers, ascertained by the higher slopes of
Z.P.–dendrimer concentration profile that required lesser amount
of dendrimers.11,12 However, when the dendrimer activities
were expressed in terms of total end group concentrations, the pattern
became opposite (Figure S2).

Results
suggest that all of the end groups of dendrimers could
not effectively take part in the interaction process. End groups of
higher generation dendrimer can backfold. DPPEth + DPPC liposome was
more sensitive toward dendrimers than the other liposomal formulations,
which could better be explained by further experiments, as described
later.

2.3 Morphological Analyses (TEM, FF-TEM, and AFM)
Spherical morphology with smooth surfaces was observed for all
of the liposomes; sizes were comparable to the DLS data, as shown
in Figure 3 (panel
A1). Conventional TEM analysis is associated with the drying of samples
which may alter the size and morphology. To double check the morphological
information, FF-TEM studies were performed. While considering the
impact of dendrimers, it was observed that with increasing concentration
of PAMAM, liposome surfaces lost its homogeneity with the ultimate
formation of aggregated heterogeneous entities. PDI values, as determined
by DLS, also support this proposition; PDI values of liposomes increased
nonsystematically with increasing dendrimer concentration (Figure S3). It is known that the oppositely charged
dendrimer can act as glue to liposomes.28 The effect of dendrimer on the structure of solid-supported (mica
substrate) lipid bilayer was further investigated by AFM studies.
Results are shown in the bottom panels of Figure 3. Height of the solid supported bilayer was
in the range 5–6 nm, as also reported by others.12,30,40 The existence of holes in the
solid-supported lipid bilayer (Figure 3, panel A3) is a natural phenomenon, which probably
is responsible in the transport processes. At lower dendrimer concentration,
white patches with higher height profiles were noticed (panel C3 of Figure 3), which were due
to the preferential adsorption of positively charged PAMAM dendrimers
on the mica and/or the edge of the bilayer holes. At lower dendrimer
concentrations, homogeneity of the membrane bilayer was significantly
perturbed (panel D3); holes were expanded because of the disruption
of bilayer through the formation of water-soluble dendrimer–lipid
aggregates. These results further support the proposition of the formation
of dendrimer–liposome complexes that are discussed in the DLS
studies.

bilayer thickness. Cholesterol (30 mol %) was used in each case. Phospholipid
concentration: 0.1 mM.

2.4 Steady-State Fluorescence Anisotropy and Lifetime
Analyses
State of polarity of a liposome surface and packing
of bilayer are other two important parameters while considering the
dendrimer–liposome interaction. Solvatochromic dye 7-hydroxycoumarin
(7-HC) was used as the molecular probe to understand the state of
polarity as well as the rigidity/fluidity of the palisade layer of
the liposome and the effect of dendrimers. Additionally, the hydrophobic
probe 6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) was used to understand the
bilayer packing of dendrimer–liposome complexes. Fluorescence
anisotropy value of 7-HC-loaded liposomes was lower (DHP + DPPC, 0.048;
DMPG + DPPC, 0.125; DPP + DPPC, 0.145; and DPPEth + DPPC, 0.093) than
DPH-loaded liposomes (DHP + DPPC, 0.078; DMPG + DPPC, 0.155; DPP +
DPPC, 0.175; and DPPEth + DPPC, 0.123). DPH, being completely hydrophobic,
resides inside the bilayer unlike 7-HC that resides on the palisade
layer. Increase in fluorescence anisotropy of 7-HC with increasing
dendrimer concentration was recorded (Figure 4, panel A and B). Dendrimers led to significant
changes in the fluorescence anisotropy of 7-HC. Its increase was due
to the adsorption of dendrimer liposome surface; further, addition
of dendrimers led to mild downshift probably because of the formation
of holes in the bilayer, reflecting the fact that some dendrimers
probably crossed through the liposome bilayer,20,21 which was further reported, by using DPH as the molecular probe.
DPH, being completely hydrophobic, will preferentially reside within
the lipid acyl chain with a parallel orientation that results in the
increase in the anisotropy value. Results, as summarized in Figure 4 (panel C and D),
suggest that the membrane fluidity decreases with increasing concentration
of dendrimer. These fluorescent probes monitor interactions between
the external and internal regions of the membrane with dendrimers.
The change in fluorescence anisotropy with increasing dendrimer concentration
indicates alterations in membrane fluidity.45 Significant changes in fluorescence anisotropy were also observed
with the variation of the dendrimer generation shown (Figure 4, panel A and C). It was observed
that the extent of interaction between the dendrimers of 3G and 4G
with liposome was less than 5G because of the formation of rigid bilayer.20,41 Higher generation of dendrimers having larger number of end groups
could effectively interact with greater magnitude with the liposome
surface.

Figure 4 Effect of PAMAM dendrimer generation (3G, ■; 4G, ●
and 5G, ▲) on the fluorescence anisotropy of 7-HC (panel A)
and DPH (panel C) in DPPEth + DPPC liposome. Effect of 4G PAMAM dendrimer
on the anisotropy values of 7-HC (panel B)- and DPH (panel D)-loaded
liposomes (DHP + DPPC, □; DMPG + DPPC, ○; DPP + DPPC,
△; and DPPEth + DPPC, ▽). Cholesterol (30 mol %) was
used in each case. Phospholipid concentration: 0.1 mM.

Time-resolved fluorescence decay studies of 7-HC
were carried out
to further understand the emission decay parameters.46 Fluorescence lifetime measures the duration of the excited
state of a probe. It can also study the interaction phenomena as it
can provide information on the change in the binding environment of
the fluorophores. Figure S4 in panel C (Supporting Information section) explains the variation in the excited
state lifetime (τ) in liposomes with dendrimer concentrations.
Fluorescence lifetime of 7-HC was 5.01, 5.65, 5.20, and 5.38 ns for
DHP + DPPC, DMPG + DPPC, DPP + DPPC, and DPPEth + DPPC, respectively.
Initially, with the progressive addition of dendrimer, fluorescence
life time increased, which finally attained constancy. Rotational
diffusion of 7-HC decreased with increasing dendrimer concentration
because of the formation of stable dendrimer–liposome complexes
that led to an overall increase in the viscosity of the medium, as
also revealed from the anisotropy studies. The lifetime did not change
significantly with the variation of dendrimer generation.

2.5 DSC Studies
DSC studies were carried
out to understand the thermal behavior of dendrimer–liposome
interaction process.45 DPPC, DPP, and DPPEth
contain two palmitoyl chains, whereas DMPG has two myristoyl chains
and DHP contains two hexadecyl hydrocarbon side chains.41,47 Lipids with lower hydrocarbon chain length are expected to have
lower pretransition and main transition temperature (Tm).41,48 DMPG shows the main phase-transition
temperature at 23.9 °C, whereas for DPPC, it was 41.4 °C.
For the DMPG + DPPC liposome, the chain melting temperature was 25.5
°C, as shown in Figure S5 (Supporting Information section). DPP + DPPC and DPPEth + DPPC liposomes show the chain
melting temperature at 44.7 and 42.0 °C, respectively, about
the same as DPPC at 41.4 °C (as all of them have similar chain
lengths). The chain melting temperature of DHP + DPPC liposome was
57.8 °C.49 However, the change in
enthalpy of DMPG + DPPC liposome was found to be higher because of
intra-/intermolecular hydrogen bonding (Table 1). Phospholipids are known to exist in two
different mesomorphic phases; highly ordered gel phase and more disordered
liquid crystalline fluid phase. Transition from the gel phase to the
liquid-crystalline phase can be reached upon heating with increasing
temperature; the intermolecular motion around C–C bonds, lateral
and rotational diffusion among the lipid molecules also increase.
The thermally induced transition of liposome can be affected by dendrimers
(DSC peaks are shifted toward lower enthalpies) and this perturbation
was found to be concentration-dependent. A downshift in the Tm values was recorded with increasing dendrimer
concentration. Pretransition temperature is an approachable parameter
for discovering the interactions between dendrimer and phospholipid
bilayers. Even at low concentrations of dendrimer, the pretransition
temperature was significantly affected. With increasing dendrimer
concentration, the pretransition temperature of lipids declined and
the main transition peak became lower and wider. Figure 5 shows that a higher concentration
of dendrimer led to the abolition of DPPEth + DPPC lipid bilayer transition
peak indicating its perturbation. A decrease in the pretransition
temperature of the DPPEth + DPPC liposome (Figure 5) suggests the interaction between dendrimer
and liposome, whereas alteration of the main transition peak suggests
that dendrimers can generate holes. The bilayer can lose its homogeneity
that depends on the dendrimer concentration.41 Interaction between dendrimers and bilayer occur mainly in the palisade
region.21 With increasing dendrimer concentration,
change in the enthalpy (ΔH) decreased (32.51–17.16
kcal·mol–1, for DPPEth + DPPC liposome), leading
to the abolition of the peak indicating the bilayer disruption.50 Results on the DSC studies are summarized in Table 1 along with the other
data. In the case of DMPG + DPPC, the carbonyl groups and glycerol
backbone favor the hydrogen bonding between dendrimer and liposome
that showed higher enthalpy values than other systems. In aqueous
medium, the hydration of the head group increases its effective volume
and decreases the orderedness of hydrocarbon chains. The increase
in head group volume, induced by the dendrimers (through the formation
of dendrimer lipid aggregates), creates energetically unfavorable
voids in the hydrocarbon region of non-interdigitated membranes. Decrease
in Tm and broadening of the transition
peaks indicate the increased size of the DMPG + DPPC liposomes as
a consequence of their interaction with PAMAM dendrimers (similar
observation was found from the size measurement by DLS).41,50 Results further suggest that at higher dendrimer concentration,
the lipid bilayer loses its homogeneity in a concentration-dependent
manner (similar observation was found by PDI measurement as shown
in Figure S3). With increasing dendrimer
concentration, the membrane fluidity increases and the endothermic
heat change decreases that lead to the lowering of the enthalpy changes
of the chain-melting processes.

2.6 Determination of Interaction Constant by Absorption
Spectroscopy
Binding constant is another important parameter
to quantify the extent of the interaction processes between the dendrimer
and liposome. Concentration of dendrimer was varied in a liposome
of fixed concentration, whereby the concentration of the free and
bound (to liposome) dendrimer was estimated colorimetrically. Results
are summarized in Table S1 (Supporting Information section). The binding tendency of dendrimer on liposomes follows
the order DMPG + DPPC > DPP + DPPC ≈ DPPEth + DPPC >
DHP +
DPPC. Because of the formation of hydrogen bonding between dendrimer
and hydroxyl group of DMPG, DMPG + DPPC liposome shows highest binding
constant value than that of other systems. With increasing dendrimer
generation, less binding affinity were found. Because, for higher
the generation of dendrimer having higher number of end groups, it
requires lesser amount of effective interaction. The binding constant
study by this technique is less sensitive than other process because
of lower concentration of dendrimer. To be acquainted with the details
about binding phenomena, isothermal titration calorimetric titrations
were done.

2.7 Isothermal Titration Calorimetric
Studies
Binding properties of the dendrimer with liposome
in phosphate
buffer solution were explored by employing the ITC. Negatively charged
liposomal dispersions were titrated by the dendrimers of different
generations. The exothermic enthalpy changes related to the interaction
reached a saturation plateau quite fast, as shown in Figure 6. The observed exothermic enthalpy
changes include contributions from the binding of dendrimers by the
lipid phosphate groups. The effect is clearly demonstrated by the
titration experiments.11,12 The control experiments for the
interaction of dendrimers with liposomes have also been carried out
by diluting the dendrimers into phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) without
having the liposomes. Upon subtraction of the calorimetric contribution
from the control experiment, a single-site binding model was applied
for the interaction between amino groups of the dendrimers with liposome
phosphate groups, leading to ΔH. In this case,
a significantly less binding enthalpy change was recorded during the
titration (Figure 6), suggesting the weak binding of the dendrimers by the phosphate
groups of the lipids.51 The much weaker
interaction emerges because of the competition between the liposomal
and the buffer phosphate groups.51 The
apparent binding constants (K) are listed in Table 1. Because of the presence
of the glycerol moiety of DMPG phospholipid liposome, the binding
constant is higher than for other liposomes (reasons already mentioned
earlier). Dendrimers get strongly absorbed onto the liposome surface
through the combined electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding
between amino groups of the dendrimers and hydroxyl groups of DMPG.51 With increasing dendrimer generation, the binding
constant values decrease. Because of the presence of larger number
of polymeric amino groups, higher generation of dendrimers interact
effortlessly than that of lower generation of the dendrimer.

concentration: 0.1 mM.

2.8 Cytotoxicity Studies
Understanding
the mechanism of dendrimer–liposome interaction is important
as the cytotoxicity issue is vital for acceptance and development
of dendrimer–liposome aggregates as pharmaceutical agents.
Cytotoxicity results obtained from 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay clearly demonstrate that all of the liposome formulations
and dendrimer–liposome aggregates were completely nontoxic
toward normal human blood lymphocyte. The nontoxicity of a bioactive
compound is the most important requirement for its therapeutic application.
The obtained results showed that the liposome and dendrimer–liposome
aggregates were almost nontoxic and possessed no effect on cell viability,
as shown in Figure 7. The nontoxic nature of dendrimer–liposome complexes was
also found even with the change of dendrimer concentrations (Figure
S6, Supporting Information section). Results
indicate that the dendrimer–liposome aggregates could be considered
as a good DDS. In PBS buffer solution, the components did not affect
the ionic strength of the solution. Thus, the formulations could be
considered safe in terms of drug delivery. However, further in vivo
studies are warranted to make final conclusions on this issue. Moreover,
the hemolysis results showed that all of the formulations of a liposome
(0.1 mM) and dendrimer–liposome aggregates (liposome–dendrimer,
M/M; 1:0.0001, 1:0.001, and 1:0.005) were nontoxic toward human RBCs
with only <1.1% hemolysis, as shown in Figure S7 (Supporting Information section).52 It has been reported earlier that the materials with <5% hemolysis
were regarded as hemocompatible.53 Thus,
the dosage of dendrimer–liposome complexes (liposome–dendrimer,
M/M; 1:0.0001, 1:0.001, and 1:0.005) were found to be hemocompatible.
Hence, the formation of dendrimer–liposome aggregates enfolding
by positively charged entity can act as a mimic to the biologically
simulated systems.

3 Conclusions
The manuscript describes
the interaction between negatively charged
liposomes with cationic PAMAM dendrimer through assessing different
biophysical properties of dendrimer–liposome aggregates. The
type and strength of the interaction are dependent on the charge and
size of the liposomes as well as the dendrimer generation. Larger
size of DHP + DPPC, DPP + DPPC, and DPPEth + DPPC in the gel state
than for DMPG + DPPC in the same state is rationalized through the
lateral packing of lipid molecules within the membrane because of
the stronger van der Waals interactions between the hydrocarbon chains.
Z.P. of the liposomes depends on the charge and electron density of
the phospholipid head group with an exception for DHP, and it is higher
for DHP + DPPC liposome. All of the liposomes carry net negative charges,
promoting the cationic dendrimers to interact with it electrostatically.
Higher generation (5G) dendrimer causes greater perturbation in the
lipid bilayer and thus could interact more effectively with liposomes.
Formation of dendrimer–liposome aggregates at higher dendrimer
concentration (liposome–dendrimer, 1:0.005, M/M) was also visualized
through the TEM, FF-TEM, and AFM studies. Increase in the fluorescence
anisotropy shows that the liposomal membranes attain rigidity at a
particular dendrimer concentration, reflecting the fact that dendrimers
could move across the liposome bilayer. DSC and fluorescence anisotropy
studies showed that the dendrimers interact not only with the hydrophilic
part of the membranes but also with the hydrocarbon chain. In the
case of DMPG + DPPC, the carbonyl groups and glycerol backbone favor
the hydrogen bonding interactions with dendrimers, and it shows higher
enthalpy changes than other systems. Extent of binding during the
formation of dendrimer–liposome complexes depends on the head
group moiety of the lipids and the generation of the dendrimers. Cytotoxicity
and hemolysis studies led to conclude that both liposomes and dendrimer–liposome
complexes are nontoxic. In conclusion, it is clear that the exploration
of the dendrimer–liposome aggregates (on a particular range
of dendrimer–liposome ratio) as a potential drug carrier has
significant prospects.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
DPPC, DHP, DMPG, DPP, DPPEth,
7-HC, DPH, and PAMAM dendrimer of different generations [generation
3 (3G), generation 4 (4G), and generation 5 (5G) as methanolic solutions]
were the products from Sigma-Aldrich Chemicals Pvt. Ltd. (USA). AR
grade disodium hydrogen phosphate (Na2HPO4·2H2O), sodium dihydrogen phosphate (NaH2PO4·2H2O), sodium chloride (NaCl), HPLC grade chloroform,
and methanol were the products of Merck Specialties Pvt. Ltd, India.
Double distilled water with a specific conductance of 2–4 μS
(at 25 ○C) was used in preparing the solutions.
All of the chemicals were stated to be ≥99.5% pure and were
used as received.

4.2 Methods
4.2.1 Preparation of Liposome
Liposomes
were prepared by the well-known thin-film hydration technique.29,30 Quantitative amount of lipids were dissolved in chloroform and methanol
(C/M, 3:1, v/v) in a round-bottom flask. The solvent was removed by
using a rotary evaporator at 40 °C. The trace amount of solvent
was removed by using vacuum desiccator for 6 h. Then, 10 mM PBS was
mixed and then hydrated for 1 h at 70 °C (temperature above the
chain-melting temperature). Salinity was maintained at 100 mM using
sodium chloride. Then, the systems were frozen at −20 °C
and thawed followed by sonication at 45 °C. This procedure (freeze–thaw
sonication) was continued up to four cycles to get small unilamellar
liposomes. Liposomes (0.1 mM) were prepared separately using DHP +
DPPC, DMPG + DPPC, DPP + DPPC, and DPPEth + DPPC along with 30 mol
% cholesterol at pH 7.4 (anionic lipid/DPPC, 3:7 M/M). In case of
dye (7-HC and DPH)-loaded liposomes, dyes were mixed along with the
lipids in C/M before thin-film generation. Dispersions were filtered
through 0.45 μm cellulose nitrate membrane filter before size
and Z.P. measurements.

4.3 Instrumental Analyses
4.3.1 Turbidity, Size, and Z.P. Measurements
Dendrimer–liposome
interaction was studied by measuring
the % transmittance (% T) at 420 nm.31,32 At this wavelength, the turbidity (τ) of a solution is assumed
to be proportional to (100 – % T). Measurements
were done using a Cary 1E UV–visible spectrophotometer (UVD-2950,
Labomed Inc., USA). Liposome solution without dendrimer was used as
blank. Size and Z.P. of liposomes in combination with dendrimers were
measured using a Zeta Sizer Nano (Malvern Instruments, U.K.). He–Ne
laser emitting light at 632.8 nm was used. The size measurements were
done using a quartz cell of 1.0 cm path length, whereas for Z.P.,
a different special kind of plastic cell was used.

4.3.2 Electron Microscopic Studies
A
drop of dilute (10–4 M) liposome dispersion was
placed on Formver carbon-coated 200 mesh copper grid and dried under
air. It was then analyzed to obtain TEM images using Hitachi H-600
transmission electron microscope (Japan) operating at 80 kV. In the
case of FF-TEM studies, a drop of the sample was placed onto the sample
holders and frozen in liquid propane. FR-7000A (Hitachi High Technologies
Ltd., Japan) was used at −150 °C for freeze fracturing.
Samples were then replicated by evaporation using platinum carbon.
The replica was placed on a 300 mesh copper grid, dried, and examined
in a transmission electron microscope (H-7650, Hitachi High Technologies
Ltd., Japan) with an accelerating voltage of 120 kV.

4.3.3 Atomic Force Microscopy
AFM images
on a solid-supported bilayer were obtained using a Multi-mode Nanoscope
III (Digital Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA, USA). Liposomal solution
(100 μL) was placed on a 1 cm2 freshly cleaved mica
incubated for an hour at 37 °C. Overload liposome was then smoothly
washed off with 1 mmol·dm–3 NaCl solution.
AFM images were taken in tapping mode by the use of a liquid cell.
Silicon nitride cantilever with a spring constant of 0.06 N m–1 operating at a driving frequency of 7–9 kHz
was used. Bilayer images were taken at altered resolution. Then, dendrimer
solutions of preferred concentration were used to rinse the bilayer.
After 30 min, yet again scanned to visualize the effect of dendrimers.
Addition of dendrimer was done slowly and carefully so that the bilayer
does not get disturbed.

4.3.4 Fluorescence Spectroscopy
Fluorescence
anisotropy and lifetime measurements were carried out by a bench-top
spectrofluorimeter (QuantaMaster-40, Photon Technology International
Inc., NJ, USA). 7-HC and DPH, used as the probes, were excited at
321 and 350 nm, respectively. Data were recorded at the emission wavelength
451 nm (for 7-HC) and 422 nm (for DPH). Fluorescence anisotropy (r) was determined according to the equation33 1  where, IVV is
the parallel polarized and IVH is the
perpendicularly polarized fluorescence intensity, G = IHV/IHH is the monochromator grating correction factor. Felix Gx software was used to calculate the anisotropy value.

Fluorescence
lifetime of 7-HC loaded in liposomes and dendrimer–liposome
aggregates was determined with a HORIBA Jobin Yvon FluoroMax (HORIBA
JobinYvon, UK) using the time-correlated single-photon counting technique.
Scattering was measured by using a Ludox (colloidal dispersion of
silica) solution; excitation was performed at 288 nm with a delta
diode-C1 diode controller.

The experimental results of time-resolved
fluorescence decay profiles, R(t), were estimated by inbuilt Horiba
EZ time software unit according to the following expression equation.34 2  Here, n = number of distinct
decay components and τi and αi are the excited-state fluorescence lifetimes
and the pre-exponential factors related to the ith
component, respectively.

4.3.5 Differential Scanning
Calorimetry
DSC studies were carried out to understand the
changes in the thermal
properties of a lipid bilayer upon interaction with dendrimers, using
a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC 1, STARe system,
Mettler Toledo, Switzerland) with a scan rate of 2 °C/min. Quantitative
amount of phospholipid mixture (7:3) with cholesterol was dissolved
in chloroform–methanol (3:1) in a 40 μL Al pan and after
that, the solvent was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen. It was
then placed under vacuum to remove traces of solvent. Dendrimer in
10 mM phosphate buffer was added to the dry lipid film, and it was
then hydrated at 70 °C. Samples were subsequently scanned by
DSC in the temperature at 10–70 °C. A pan filled with
dendrimer in buffer solution was used as a reference. The enthalpies
and characteristic temperatures were calculated using Mettler-Toledo
STARe software.

4.3.6 Isothermal Titration
Calorimetry
ITC experiments were studied by using VP-ITC
titration calorimeter
(MicroCal, Northampton, MA). At first, the samples were degassed carefully.
The liposomes were kept in a sample cell, and the dendrimers (ligand)
were put in a syringe of volume of 300 μL. Total 75 injections
were performed by 15 s each at a 3 min time interval. Per injection,
3 μL aliquots (ligand solution) were added sequentially in the
sample cell. This order of sequence was maintained to ensure complete
occupancy of the binding sites and titrating with the same ligand
without removing the samples from the cell until the titration signal
was essentially constant. The corresponding heat of dilution was deducted
from the binding experiments prior to curve fitting. The titration
experiments were repeated three times.

4.3.7 Binding
Constant
Binding constant
of the dendrimer–liposome aggregate was also determined colorimetrically.
Different amounts of dendrimer solution were separately added to a
fixed amount of liposome solution. After homogenization, the solutions
were kept for 2 h in attaining the equilibrium. It was then centrifuged
at 20 000 rpm for 1 h, whereby the dendrimer–liposome
aggregate got sedimented. The supernatant, which contained the free
dendrimer, was estimated colorimetrically using a UV–vis spectrophotometer
(JASCO V-30, USA) at 282 nm. The corresponding liposome without dendrimer
was used as a reference. Binding constant, K, is
associated with the binding and unbinding reaction of the receptor
(L) and ligand (D) molecules, which is formalized as 3  

The reaction is characterized by the
forward constant k1 and the backward rate
constant k–1. Under equilibrium,
the forward binding transition D + L → DL should be balanced
by the backward unbinding transition DL → D + L. That is, k1[L][D] = k–1[LD], where [L], [D], and [LD] represent the concentration of unbound
free receptor (liposome), the concentration of unbound free ligand
(dendrimer), and the concentration of ligand–receptor complexes.
The binding constant K is defined by 4  

4.3.8 Cytotoxicity
Analyses
The blood
sample was collected from the healthy human subjects (n = 3) for the separation of lymphocytes, as described previously.35 Human blood (5.0 mL) was diluted with PBS (1:1)
and layered onto Histopaque 1077, as described earlier.33 After the treatment with liposome and dendrimer–liposome
aggregates, the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMCs) (2 ×
105 cells in each set) was washed with PBS (1×) for
three times using centrifugation (2200 rpm for 3 min per wash) and
was subjected to quantitative estimation for cytotoxicity by a nonradioactive,
colorimetric assay systems using tetrazolium salt, MTT. The percentage
of proliferation was calculated as described previously.33

4.3.9 Hemolysis Assay
The hemocompatibility
of liposomes and dendrimer–liposome aggregates were determined
in terms of the percent hemolysis36 5  where AS is the
sample absorbance, AN is the absorbance
of the negative control, and AP is the
absorbance of the positive control.

All of the experiments,
except the DSC studies, were carried out at ambient but controlled
temperature.
