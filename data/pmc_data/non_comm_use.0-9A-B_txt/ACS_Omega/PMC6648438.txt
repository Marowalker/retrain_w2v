Hydrogenolysis of biomass-derived
furfural (FFA) to 1,2-pentanediol
(1,2-PeD) was investigated using a bifunctional catalyst with basic
and metallic sites, which was synthesized by the hydrothermal method.
The synthesized catalyst consisting of rhodium (Rh) supported on an
octahedral molecular sieve (OMS-2) of different loadings, such as
0.5, 1, and 1.5% w/w, was studied, and 1% (w/w) loading gave the best
results. This 1% w/w Rh/OMS-2 catalyst showed excellent catalytic
activity and selectivity for the hydrogenolysis reaction because of
better dispersion of rhodium, later revealed by characterization.
Furthermore, 1% Rh/OMS-2 catalyst was well characterized in virgin
and reused states using various techniques such as Fourier-transform
infrared spectroscopy, NH3-temperature-programmed desorption
(TPD), CO2-TPD, temperature-programmed reduction, H2 pulse chemisorption, scanning electron microscopy, high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
surface area, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy,
and differential scanning calorimetry–thermogravimetry analysis.
The catalyst showed a higher surface area of 72 m2/g and
the average size of the highly dispersed Rh metal of ∼2 nm.
The studies were performed in a batch reactor; the catalyst offered
almost 100% conversion of FFA with 87% selectivity to 1,2-PeD at 160
°C and 30 atm hydrogen pressure in 8 h. The reaction mechanism
and kinetic model have been developed using a dual-site Langmuir–Hinshelwood–Hougen–Watson
mechanism. The activation energies were 12.3 and 27.6 kcal/mol, correspondingly.
The catalyst was found to be active, selective, and reusable.

Introduction
Octahedral molecular
sieves (OMS-2, cryptomelane-type) of a manganese
oxide-based material have been used since decades in a variety of
applications such as battery electrode,1 sensor material in chemical sensing,2 energy storage,3 supercapacitors,4 catalyst in redox reactions5 and water oxidation,6 adsorbent
in adsorptive desulfurization of fuel gas, etc.7 The core of OMS-2 has linked edges and vertices of MnO6 octahedra, in the form of square tunnels of 2 × 2 with
one-dimensional pore structure. The square tunnels have approximate
pore size of 0.46 × 0.46 nm2.7,8 The
metal ions in the tunnel balance the valencies, +2, +3, and +4, as
well as provide active sites for selective catalysis.9 Briefly, OMS-2 is popular because of its porous nature,
ability to form open tunnels, low cost, robustness, high surface area,
and environmental friendliness.10 The OMS-2-supported
catalyst possesses acidic as well as basic sites with loading of metals
such as of Ag and Pt, which were already used for the hydrogenolysis
and selective hydrogenation reactions.11−13

Hydrogenolysis
of the furan ring of furfural (FFA) generates many
chemicals such as furfural alcohol (FA); tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol
(THFA); terahydrofurfural;14 2-methyl terahydrofuran;15 and important diols such as 1,2-pentanediol
(1,2-PeD), 1,5-pentanediol (1,5-PeD), etc. 1,2-PeD is an important
chemical used in numerous applications, for instance, as a monomer
in the manufacture of polyesters,16 as
an intermediate in the production of fungicides, as a constituent
of products such as printing inks and disinfectant,17 and in cosmetics as an antimicrobial agent.18 Since decades, 1,2-PeD is being produced from
petrochemical sources such as n-pentene using mineral
acid or formic acid,19 but the process
is not green as it uses homogeneous acids as a catalyst and generates
waste. There is ample literature available for production of pentanediol
(both 1,2-PeD and 1,5-PeD) from feedstocks such as furfuryl alcohol
(FA) and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA), which are the intermediates
of furfural hydrogenolysis. For example, the Tomishige group studied
hydrogenolysis of THFA to produce 1,5-PeD using ReOx/MoOx-modified Rh/SiO2 catalysts in the aqueous phase.15,16 The work related
to gas-phase hydrogenation of FFA to FA, as well as liquid-phase hydrogenation
of furfural and hydroxymethyl furfural to FA, THFA, 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)-furan,
etc., is excellently summarized by Tomishige and co-workers.20 The hydrogenolysis of furfural was studied extensively
by Zhang et al.,21 who obtained ∼42.1%
yield of 1,2-PeD by hydrogenolysis of FFA over Ru/MnOx catalyst at 150 °C and 1.5 MPa hydrogen pressure.
A critical review on selective hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation of
various biomass-derived products includes conversion of FFA to value-added
chemicals including FA and THFA over metal oxide-modified noble metal
catalysts such as Rh–ReOx, Rh–MoOx, Ir–ReOx/SiO2, Ir–ReOx/SiO2, etc.22 Moreover, use of ReOx-modified Ir metal (IrReOx) catalysts for hydrogenation of glycerol, sorbitol, and
related compounds was also studied.23 A
Pd (0.66 wt %)–Ir–ReOx/SiO2 catalyst was used to produce 1,5-PeD up to 71.4% using furfural
as feedstock in one pot at 60 atm hydrogen pressure and 120 °C.24 Also, a Rh (0.66 wt %)–Ir–ReOx/SiO2 catalyst produced 71.1% of
1,5-PeD from furfural (50 wt %) in a one-pot two-step temperature
reaction.25 Insight into the reaction mechanism
and kinetics of THFA hydrogenolysis to 1,5-PeD was provided using
Rh–ReOx/SiO2 and Rh/SiO2 catalysts.26 On a layered double
oxide of the Cu–Mg3AlO4.5 catalyst, combined
yield (of 1,2-PeD and 1,5-PeD) up to 80% was obtained at 140 °C
and 60 atm hydrogen pressure with the highest selectivity of 51% to
1,2-PeD using FA as a feedstock.27 A report
suggested a selective hydrogenation of FFA to THFA using a bimetallic
Cu–Ni/carbon nanotube (CNT) and Ni/CNT as catalysts at mild
reaction conditions.28 Recently, Mizugaki
et al. used Pt/HT for the direct hydrogenolysis of FFA to 1,2-PeD
and successfully obtained 73% yield of 1,2-PeD.17 The bifunctional Pd/MMT-K10 catalyst was also reported
to yield 66% 1,2-PeD directly from furfural with complete conversion.29 As production of pentanediol involves a ring-opening
reaction, it requires a longer reaction time and harsh reaction conditions.
Therefore, it remained a challenging task to get higher conversion
of FFA as well as selectivity to 1,2-PeD at mild reaction conditions.

In the present work, hydrogenolysis of furfural to 1,2-pentanediol
was achieved in one pot using a heterogeneous mixed-valent octahedral
molecular sieve. Rhodium (1% w/w)-impregnated OMS-2 (1% Rh/OMS-2)
catalyst was synthesized using the hydrothermal method. Additionally,
this catalyst was well characterized in virgin and reused forms by
several techniques such as Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy,
NH3-temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), CO2-TPD, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), H2 pulse
chemisorption, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD),
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area, Raman spectroscopy,
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and differential scanning
calorimetry–thermogravimetry analysis (DSC–TGA). The
catalyst was selected for hydrogenolysis of FFA, and various reaction
parameters were also optimized. A dual-site Langmuir–Hinshelwood–Hougen–Watson
(LHHW) mechanism was proposed and kinetic model established. This
is the first report on the Rh/OMS-2 catalyst that was used for the
single-step hydrogenolysis of furfural while achieving complete conversion
of furfural along with higher selectivity (87%) of 1,2-PeD at mild
reaction conditions.

Results and Discussion
Efficacy of Different Catalysts
Catalysts such as 1%
Pt/HT were prepared by the methods discussed by Mizugaki et al.,17 and other catalysts including 20% Ag/OMS-2,
30% Ag/OMS-2, 1% Pt–9% Mg/OMS-2, 1% Pd/OMS-2, and 1% Rh/OMS-2
were prepared by the method discussed in the Experimental
Section. All of these catalysts were screened for hydrogenolysis
of FFA to 1,2-PeD. The reaction is sequential hydrogenation of FFA
to give reaction intermediate FA, which on further hydrogenolysis
produces the final product 1,2-pentanediol (Scheme 1). The catalysts were screened on the basis
of conversion of FFA and selectivity to 1,2-PeD. From Figure 1, it was observed that all
OMS-2-supported catalysts showed significant activity in terms of
conversion of FFA. The OMS-2 support was found to be suitable for
the complete hydrogenation of FFA. This was because of the acidic
and basic sites available on OMS-2. It was a well-known fact that
conversion of FFA into 1,2-PeD requires a longer reaction time and
usually high temperature and pressure.17,30,31 The conversion of FFA after 8 h was found to be in
the order of 30% Ag/OMS-2 (100%), >20% Ag/OMS-2 (100%), >1%
Rh/OMS-2
(99.6%), >1% Pt–9% Mg/OMS-2 (99%), >1% Pd/OMS-2 (98.4%).

Scheme 1 Hydrogenolysis of FFA to 1,2-PeD
As already discussed, Ag and
Pt were used for selective hydrogenation.
Mg was used to increase the basicity of the catalyst. However, it
was observed that only moderate basicity, which was provided by OMS-2,
was needed for selective hydrogenation. For the selective hydrogenation
reaction, like C–O and C=C hydrogenation, OMS-2 is a
very well known catalyst. As we already know, multiple valencies of
Mn such as +2, +4, and +7 play very crucial role in the hydrogenolysis
reaction and selective hydrogenation reaction.11−13 The use of
Pt has been reported for FFA hydrogenolysis.17,32 Pt in combination with Mg on an OMS-2 support produced intermediates
FA (78%) and THFA (15%) over 1,2-PeD (5%). The use of Pd increased
the selectivity of 1,2-PeD up to 76% but not more than that of 1%
Rh/OMS-2. The selectivity profile was in the order of 1% Rh/OMS-2
(87%) > 1% Pd/OMS-2 (76%) > 30% Ag/OMS-2 (23%).

Additionally,
the well-dispersed Rh provided metallic sites on
the catalyst and synergistically carried out the furan ring-opening
reaction, which is further well discussed in CO2-TPD and
NH3-TPD analyses as well as in Scheme 2. Hence, the 1% Rh/OMS-2 catalyst was selected
for further optimization of various reaction parameters. This catalyst
was also compared with previously documented catalysts, and the comparison
is presented in Table 1. It can be understood that of all entries, #1–3 showed good
conversion but not the selectivity to 1,2-PeD. In the case of other
entries such as #4–8, harsh reaction conditions were used.
In contrast, the 1% Rh/OMS-2 (entry #10) catalyst used in this study
has significantly improved both conversion and selectivity at comparatively
mild reaction conditions.

Catalyst Characterization
X-ray
Diffraction
The crystallinity of the catalysts
was studied using the X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique (Bruker D8
Advance diffractometer). Cu Kα (λ = 0.154 nm) was used
at 2θ value of 5–90°. The diffraction peaks of all
synthesized catalysts OMS-2 (α-MnO2), virgin 1% Rh/OMS-2,
and reused 1% Rh/OMS-2 showed very sharp peaks (Figure 2). All patterns were found to be identical
with JCPDS no. 00-006-0547 (D) (cryptomelane-phase) of MnO2 at various 2θ values: 12.98 (101), 18.38 (002), 28.98 (103̅),
37.74 (112̅), 50.23 (114), 56.39 (413), 60.62 (215). The correct
match for Rh (Figure 2B,C) was found to be with JCPDS no. 03-065-2866 (D) for the peaks
at 2θ of 41.5, 47.2, and 69.3 due to lattice spacings 111, 200,
and 220, respectively. All of the peaks of Rh at 2θ of 41.5,
47.2, and 69.3 are seen overlapping with those of OMS-2 (Figure 2).

CO2-TPD and NH3-TPD Analyses
Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) analysis (AutoChem II 2910,
Micromeretics) of OMS-2, 1% Rh/OMS-2, and reused 1% Rh/OMS-2 catalysts
was carried out at 50–650 °C (Figure 3a,b). The basic and acidic strengths of the
catalysts were evaluated and are mentioned in Table 2. All of the catalysts showed three distinct
peaks for CO2-TPD. The OMS-2 catalyst (Figure 3a) showed two combined peaks
in the temperature range of 90–500 °C, indicating the
presence of weak and moderate basic sites. The sharp peak in the temperature
range of 80–300 °C indicated the presence of weak basic
sites on both virgin and reused 1% Rh/OMS-2 catalysts, as indicated
in Figure 3a-A,B. The
increased intensity of weak basic sites may correspond to Rh. Two
minor peaks in the temperature ranges of 350–550 and 550–650
°C indicate a few moderate and strong basic sites on the catalysts,
respectively.

Rh/OMS-2, and (C) reused 1% Rh/OMS-2. (b) NH3-TPD patterns

OMS-2	0.3	0.18	5.63	
1% Rh/OMS-2	0.11	0.22	6.68	
reused 1% Rh/OMS-2	0.095	0.20	6.08	
As seen in Figure 3b, a good number of acidic sites are shown
by all OMS-2, 1% Rh/OMS-2,
and reused 1% Rh/OMS-2 catalysts. The intensity of the peak in the
temperature range of 80–300 °C of 1% Rh/OMS-2 and reused
1% Rh/OMS-2 catalysts increased because of incorporation of Rh. The
three distinct peaks in the case of 1% Rh/OMS-2 virgin and reused
catalysts correspond to weak, moderate, and strong acidic sites of
catalysts (Figure 3b). The increased acidity of the catalyst implies incorporation of
Rh in the pores of catalysts.

TPR Analysis
Temperature-programmed
reduction (TPR)
analysis (AutoChem II 2910, Micromeretics) was performed for comprehending
efficacy of metallic sites of catalysts. TPR analysis was carried
out to check the reducibility of catalysts. The OMS-2 catalyst showed
H2 reduction peak in between 50 and 250 °C. Both 1%
Rh/OMS-2 and reused 1% Rh/OMS-2 catalysts showed the reduction peak
between 150 and 300 °C and another adsorption peak at 490–750
°C (Figure 4),
which was because of the strong interaction of Rh above and inside
OMS-2 nanorods; this was also supported through TEM analysis. The
values obtained in TPR analysis are mentioned in Table 2. It was also seen that the
color of the sample was changed from black to brown, which was also
one of the indications of a change in the oxidation state to MnO2 as reported by our lab.35

Rh/OMS-2.

H2 Pulse Chemisorption
H2 pulse
chemisorption was performed on a Micromeritics Autochem 2920 instrument
to measure the dispersion of Rh over OMS-2 and active surface area.
The sample was reduced at 400 °C for 1 h under 10% v/v H2/Ar flow and then cooled to 50 °C. Chemisorption was
performed by a pulse of a mixture of 10% v/v H2/Ar. The
study showed that Rh dispersion was found to be 14.8% over OMS-2 considering
the stoichiometric factor as 1. The value obtained indicates high
dispersion of Rh over the OMS-2 catalyst. The average Rh particle
size obtained was 6.2 nm (Table 3). The values for metallic surface area and H2 uptake are also mentioned in Table 3.

FTIR Studies
FTIR
analysis (PerkinElmer, 1000 PC) was
done to comprehend the stretching as well as bending vibrations of
the catalysts. The catalyst samples were prepared by forming KBr pallets. Figure 5 shows FTIR spectra
of all of the catalysts with similar vibrations. The characteristic
adsorption bands for all three OMS-2-supported catalysts at 723, 1383,
1633, and 3446 cm–1 were observed.8,36 The signature dominant peak at 1633 cm–1 was due
to stretching and bending vibrations of the adsorbed water molecule
in the tunnel of OMS-2.35,37 The peak at 1383 cm–1 was because of −OH bending vibrations of adsorbed
water. The adsorption band at 723 cm–1 indicated
Mn–O and Mn–O–Mn lattice vibrations.38

(c) virgin
1% Rh/OMS-2 catalysts.

Raman Spectroscopy
Raman spectra were recorded with
a WITec alpha300 R, GmbH, spectrometer, equipped with a 532 nm Ar–Ne
laser. The 1% Rh/OMS-2 catalyst represents four distinct peaks located
at around 323, 373, 492, and 662 cm–1 (Figure 6). The characteristic
sharp peak at 662 cm–1 indicates Mn3O4 of OMS-2. In the case of 1% Rh/OMS-2 catalyst, the peak was
sharp, indicating the increased dominance of Mn3O4 species. The bands at 323 and 373 cm–1 are observed
because of the active mode of Mn3O4.39 The band at 576 cm–1 corresponds
to the stretching mode of Mn–O lattice.40

BET Surface Area and Pore
Size Analysis
The surface
area and pore size distribution measurements were done using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method (Micromeritics ASAP 2010 system). The analysis was carried
out at liquid nitrogen temperature using N2 gas as the
adsorbent by a multipoint method. Catalyst samples (300 mg) were evacuated
at 350 °C for 4 h. The surface area, pore volume, and average
pore diameter of OMS-2, 1% Rh/OMS-2, and reused 1% Rh/OMS-2 catalysts
were measured and are mentioned in Table 4. The pore volume of the 1% Rh/OMS-2 catalyst
decreased, indicating the good dispersion of Rh. There was insignificant
decrease in the surface area of reused 1% Rh/OMS-2 from 72 to 63 m2/g, and the average pore diameter decreased from 84 to 79
Å. This may be due to the blockage of the pores of the catalyst
by the residuals of the reaction mass after reuse.

SEM Analysis
The morphology of the
catalysts was studied
by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), JEOL, model JSM-6380LA,
Japan. To ensure proper imaging, the catalyst samples were coated
with platinum for 20 s. Cryptomelane type of OMS-2 shows fine and
uniform nanorod-like morphology. OMS-2 crystals bundle together, which
can be clearly seen in SEM images (Figure 7A,B).41 The 1%
Rh/OMS-2 catalyst shows uniform dispersion of Rh over the surface
of OMS-2, which was also revealed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDX) elemental mapping (Figure 8) as well as HR-TEM (Figure 9) analysis.

EDX Analysis
Elemental analysis of OMS-2 and 1% Rh/OMS-2
catalyst was carried out using EDAX, and the results are summarized
in Table 5. As shown
in Table 5, Rh, Mn,
and K all were present in the as-synthesized amount of 1% Rh/OMS-2
catalyst. The atomic weight percentage of Rh was 1.17%, which was
much close to that of the synthesized 1% Rh/OMS-2 catalyst. Additionally,
it was also revealed that the atomic weight ratio of K/Mn of the OMS-2
catalyst was 0.013. In the case of 1% Rh/OMS-2 catalyst, it was 0.001,
which was much less than that of OMS-2. This indicates that doped
Rh was well deposited over OMS-2 nanorods.

OMS-2	 	98.71	1.29	22.48	 	0.013	
HR-TEM Analysis
The high-resolution transmission electron
microscopy (HR-TEM) characterization technique was performed using
a JEOL 2100, Japan, instrument with an accelerating voltage of 200
kV. The samples were prepared by dispersing the material in isopropyl
alcohol. A drop of the homogeneous dispersion was loaded on a carbon-coated
200-mesh, copper grid and allowed to dry before analysis. The nanorods
were confirmed by HR-TEM analysis, which indicates that the length
of nanorods was in the range of 0.8–1 μm and diameter
of about 12–14 nm. The well-defined lattice fringes were observed,
which indicates that the catalyst is highly crystalline and which
supports the XRD. The fringe distance, that is, d-spacing, was measured, and it was found to be 5.3 Å. Figure 9D indicates the average
particle size of Rh to be 2 nm. The reused 1% Rh/OMS-2 catalyst showed
no deformation in the structure, indicating the stability of the catalyst
and that it can be reused.

XPS Analysis
XPS
analysis (AXIS Supra, Kratos Analytical,
U.K.) was employed to study the surface properties and to identify
the elements present in the catalyst. Table 6 represents the percent atomic concentration
of each element present in the 1% Rh/OMS-2 catalyst. The Rh 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 peaks with the binding energies of
313.5 and 308.6 eV, respectively, are seen in Figure 10A-a; the Rh 3d peaks at lower binding energies
307.5 and 311.9 eV correspond to the Rh(0) species. The literature
value for Rh(0) species appears in the range of 307–307.5 eV
and at 311.9 eV and hence confirms the presence of metallic Rh.35−37 The peak maxima at 308.6 and 309.4 eV were due to Rh3+ species, as given in Figure 10A-a,b, respectively. This is also in agreement with
the literature value for Rh3+.37 The peak at 304.7 eV is attributed to the 3d level with a different
chemical environment.42 As shown in Figure 10B, the two characteristic
peaks of Mn 2p3/2 at 641.8 eV and Mn 2p1/2 at
653.2 eV with splitting of 11.4 eV were found to be in good agreement
with literature values.43,44 The Mn 2p3/2 peak of 1% Rh/OMS-2 was at 641.8 and 642.6 eV for Mn3+ and Mn4+, respectively.45,46 The additional
doublet of Mn 2p1/2 was also observed at 653.2 and 653.8
eV, which correspond to Mn3+ and Mn2+, respectively.
The asymmetrical O 1s spectra are shown in Figure 10C, in which a binding energy of 529.2 eV
was assigned to the lattice oxygen (O2–) (denoted
Olatt). The second peak at 530.7 was assigned to the defect
oxide (O– or O22–)
or hydroxyl groups.35,45 These results were also in good
harmony with those of the TGA–DSC study.

DSC–TGA
Analysis
TGA–DSC was performed
on an STA 449 F3 Jupiter, NETZSCH, simultaneous thermal analyzer.
The analysis of 1% Rh/OMS-2 catalyst was carried out from 25 to 800
°C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min using a continuous flow
of nitrogen. The thermal stability of the 1% Rh/OMS-2 catalyst was
observed using DSC–TGA analysis techniques (Figure 11). There was an insignificant
weight loss of 3–4%, which indicates the change in the oxidation
state of the catalyst from MnO2 to Mn2O3, and further, up to a temperature of 800 °C, no weight
loss was observed. The endothermic peak in the region 530–590
°C was because of alteration in the oxidation state of OMS-2
from MnO2 to Mn2O3.35,47,48 Thus, this confirms thermal stability
of the catalyst up to 800 °C.

Effect of Different Reaction Parameters
Effect of Speed of Agitation
The reaction was carried
out at different agitation speeds ranging from 600 to 1000 rpm to
study the effect of agitation on the conversion of FFA. It was observed
that there was no alteration in the conversion or selectivity of 1,2-PeD,
which denotes no mass transfer resistance. Therefore, all of the further
studies were carried out at 800 rpm as it was found to be the optimum
agitation speed (Figure 12).

Effect of Various Solvents
Solvents including methanol,
ethanol, 2-propanol, dioxane, and toluene were used for studying the
effect of solvent on the conversion of FFA and 1,2-PeD selectivity.
Almost all solvents exhibited good conversion of FFA in 8 h. The rate
of hydrogenation is greatly dependent on the solubility as well as
polarity reflected in terms of dielectric constant (ε).49,50 A proper combination of H2 pressure and solubility is
desirable for a higher rate of hydrogenation. Among all of the solvents
used, methanol gives the best result as its dielectric constant (33)
is greater than that of ethanol (24.3), 2-propanol (20.2), toluene
(2.4), and 1,4-dioxane (2.2). Thus, a remarkable conversion of FFA
(99.6%) and selectivity to 1,2-PeD (87%) were observed in methanol
as compared to those in other solvents (Tables 7 and 8). Therefore,
all of the studies were carried out using methanol as a solvent.

Effect of
Metal Loading
The effect of rhodium loadings
of 0.5, 1, and 1.5% w/w on OMS-2 supported catalyst was studied keeping
other reaction parameters constant (Figure 13). The rate of hydrogenation was in direct
proportion with Rh loading, i.e., an increase in Rh loading increases
the conversion and selectivity. Because it is a series reaction, both
conversion and selectivity were affected with an increase in Rh loading.
Initially, with an increase in Rh loading from 0.5 to 1% w/w, the
number of metal sites increased and hence both conversion of FFA and
1,2-PeD selectivity were also improved. At Rh loadings of 1 and 1.5%,
the conversion of FFA was increased because of the proportional increase
in the number of active sites; however, no change in the selectivity
of 1,2-PeD was observed. Therefore, 1% Rh loading was preferred for
further studies.

selectivity

weight, 0.25 g; hydrogen pressure, 30 atm; temperature, 160 °C;
solvent, methanol; reaction time 8 h; and total volume, 20 cm3.

Effect of Catalyst Loading
The effect of catalyst loading
was comprehensively studied by altering the quantity of catalyst from
7.5 to 15 g/L (Figure 14). Initially, the rate of reaction was proportional to the amount
of catalyst because of the proportional increase in the number of
active sites. At 12.5 and 15 g/L catalyst loading, neither the conversion
nor the selectivity was affected. This indicates that the number of
active sites was sufficient and any more catalyst concentration was
not needed. This confirms that the rate of reaction was directly proportional
to the number of active sites in the absence of mass transfer and
intraparticle diffusion resistance. Additionally, the initial rate
of hydrogenation of FFA was plotted against catalyst loading. It was
observed that with an increase in catalyst loading the rate of reaction
was also increased (Figure 15). Hence, it shows that there is a linear relation between
catalyst loading and rate of reaction.

of 1,2-PeD. FFA, 0.0073 mol; speed of agitation, 800 rpm; hydrogen
pressure, 30 atm; temperature, 160 °C; solvent, methanol; reaction
time, 8 h; and total volume, 20 cm3.

Figure 15 Plot of initial rate vs catalyst loading.

Effect of Initial Concentration of FFA
The amount of
furfural was varied from 0.0062 to 0.0083 mol to study its effect
on the conversion of FFA and selectivity of 1,2-PeD. It was observed
that with an increase in furfural concentration the final conversion
and selectivity of 1,2-PeD decreased. As the catalyst loading remains
constant throughout the study, the number of available metal active
sites on the catalyst surface is limited. Hence, with the increase
in initial moles of furfural, a decrease in the conversion level was
observed. The rate of formation of FA is much higher than that of
1,2-PeD; consequently, with the increase in the initial moles of the
substrate, increase in FA selectivity is observed. At 0.0073 mol concentration,
after 8 h, 99% conversion and 87% selectivity were obtained (Figure 16).

Figure 16 Effect of initial concentration
of FFA on conversion of FFA and
selectivity of 1,2-PeD. Speed of agitation, 800 rpm; catalyst weight,
0.25 g; hydrogen pressure, 30 atm; temperature, 160 °C; solvent,
methanol; reaction time, 8 h; and total volume, 20 cm3.

Effect of Hydrogen Pressure
The hydrogen pressure was
varied from 10 to 40 atm to evaluate its effect on the conversion
of FFA and selectivity of 1,2-PeD. As shown in Figure 17, it was observed that the hydrogenation
of FFA to FA and its subsequent hydrogenation finally into 1,2-PeD
appear to be greatly dependent on hydrogen pressure, and with an increase
in the hydrogen pressure, there was a remarkable increase in conversion.
The selectivity of FA (intermediate) decreased as the pressure was
increased, which is caused by the equivalent increase in the concentration
of dissolved hydrogen in the liquid phase. This leads to successive
hydrogenation of FA to 1,2-PeD. However, an increase in pressure beyond
30 atm leads to a decrease in selectivity of 1,2-PeD as the latter
was because of the formation of oligomers over hydrogenated products.51 Hence, maintaining adequate pressure is crucial
to ensure high selectivity of 1,2-PeD. Therefore, optimum hydrogen
pressure, i.e., 30 atm, was maintained for all of the experiments.

of hydrogen pressure on conversion of FFA and on the selectivity
of products. FFA, 0.0073 mol; speed of agitation, 800 rpm; catalyst
wt, 0.25 g; temperature, 160 °C; reaction time, 8 h; and total
volume, 20 cm3.

Effect of Temperature
The effect of temperature on
the rate of reaction was studied from 130 to 170 °C (Figures 18 and 19). The conversion increased with an increase in
reaction temperature. Thus, this indicates that the reaction was intrinsically
kinetically controlled. At reaction temperatures of 160 and 170 °C,
it was observed that the conversion remains practically the same,
indicating that there was significant intraparticle diffusion limitation.
Therefore, 160 °C was chosen as the optimum temperature (Figure 18). As shown in Figure 18, the selectivity
of 1,2-PeD increased with an increase in temperature. However, with
a further increase in temperature (above 160 °C), oligomers of
high molecular weight were formed and selectivity of 1,2-PeD dropped
significantly. The selectivity of products FA and 1,2-PeD is provided
for optimizing the reaction time (Figure S5).

Catalyst Reusability and Leaching Study
The reusability
of the Rh/OMS-2 catalyst was studied for four cycles (Figure 20). The catalyst was filtered,
and the filtrate containing products was collected. The recovered
catalyst was washed with methanol and dried for 3 h to ensure removal
of any adsorbed species from the catalyst pores. A total weight of
0.25 g was maintained in all of the reusability experiments by adding
the difference of the catalyst weight from the previous run. There
was a marginal drop in the conversion, indicating that the catalyst
was active, selective, and reusable. A hot filtration test was also
performed for catalyst stability. The agitation was stopped after
1 h, and the reaction mass filtered to remove the catalyst. The clear
filtrate (reaction mass) was continuously agitated for next 4 h. It
was observed that there was no change in the conversion, and also
there was no leaching of the catalyst in the filtrate containing the
reactants. Thus, this confirms almost negligible leaching of active
Rh sites. Inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy
analysis of reaction mass was carried out to find that the leaching
of rhodium was below the detection level.

Kinetics of Hydrogenolysis
of FFA
Hydrogenolysis of
FFA leads to 1,2-PeD through a series of reactions (Scheme 2). At the very beginning, hydrogen
is adsorbed dissociatively on the metallic site of the catalyst and
the aldehyde group was weakly adsorbed on the basic site. For hydrogenolysis,
the basic sites of the OMS-2 support were found to be outstanding
and the symbiotic relation of the evenly dispersed nanoparticles of
Rh leads to diol formation. Similar observations with Pt loading on
a basic support were found by Mizugaki et al.17 Rh helps in aromatic-ring-opening hydrogenation reactions.52 During the surface reaction, the aldehyde group
is hydrogenated, resulting in the formation of a hydroxyl group, subsequently,
forming FA as an intermediate (Figure S1, Supporting Information (SI)). Subsequently, the furan ring gets
hydrogenated and ring opening occurs to form 1,2-PeD through tautomerism
of the intermediate species as reported by Chen et al.27 Finally, 1,2-PeD gets desorbed and both basic
and metallic sites again remain available for the next reaction cycle.

Development of Mathematical Model
From Schemes 1 and 2, a detailed mathematical model was deduced
for hydrogenolysis of FFA. The mathematical model was developed considering
the LHHW mechanism (dual site).53 A similar
kinetic model was already studied in our lab.54 The rates at various steps of the hydrogenation reactions are mentioned
here (SI). The rate of consumption of FFA
(A) in the hydrogenation reaction can be given as: 1  The rate of reaction of
B (FA) to E (1,2-PeD)
can be written as 2  The rate of formation of
E can be written
as: 3  where w is the catalyst loading,
12.5 g/L.

After solving eqs 1–3, adsorption constants
(K) along with rate constant (k)
were calculated. The values of K are mentioned in Table S1 whereas k values are
given in Table 8. With
the help of the Arrhenius plot, activation energy for each step was
calculated for 12.3 and 27.6 kcal/mol for formation of FA and 1,2-PeD,
correspondingly. The formation of FA at low temperature indicates
low activation energy requirements. As per the calculations, the concentration
of 1,2-PeD increases with an increase in temperature because it has
higher activation energy. The parity plot for the initial rate of
reaction was also calculated and is shown in Figure 21. The predicted and experimental rate values
were plotted over a parity. Both rate expressions are in good agreement
with experimental data.

Figure 21 Parity plot of theoretical vs experimental
rate at optimized reaction
parameters.

Conclusions
OMS-2-supported heterogeneous catalysts were successfully prepared
by the hydrothermal technique. Rh in synergy with the OMS-2 support
sets the new benchmark for selective hydrogenolysis of furfural and
the furan ring-opening reaction. The basic support aids faster hydrogenolysis
of FFA to give 1,2-PeD in a single step. The conversion of FFA was
99.6% with a significant selectivity of 1,2-PeD of 87%. Various reaction
parameters were studied to optimize the reaction conditions for FFA
hydrogenolysis. The reaction mechanism and kinetics were studied on
the basis of a dual-site LHHW mechanism. The activation energies were
evaluated for formation of FA and 1,2-PeD and were found to be 12.3
and 27.6 kcal/mol, respectively. The catalyst was prepared, characterized,
and reused for the hydrogenolysis reaction of FFA up to four cycles
with insignificant change in the conversion and selectivity. The structural
integrity of the 1% Rh/OMS-2 catalyst in virgin and reused states
was confirmed by characterization techniques. In a nutshell, a bifunctional
1% Rh/OMS-2 catalyst shows excellent activity, selectivity, stability,
and reusability. This process is novel and green.

Experimental
Section
Chemicals
All of the chemicals were purchased from
reputed vendors. Furfural was purchased from S D Fine Chemicals, Mumbai,
India. Solvents and precursors such as methanol, isopropyl alcohol
(2-PrOH), ethanol, toluene, 1,4-dioxane, potassium permanganate, magnesium
nitrate hexahydrate, and rhodium trichloride were procured from Thomas
Baker, Mumbai. Manganese nitrate hexahydrate, aluminum nitrate nonahydrate,
palladium nitrate hydrate, silver nitrate, and hexachloro-palatinate
(of high-performance liquid chromatography grade) were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich, India.

Catalyst Preparation
In general,
in the catalyst synthesis
method,7 precursor manganese nitrate (26
mmol) was dissolved in 50 mL of distilled water to form solution A.
An aqueous permanganate solution B was prepared by dissolving KMnO4 (18.4 mmol) into 50 mL of distilled water. The solution B
was added dropwise to solution A with vigorous stirring. After addition,
the mixture was stirred for next 30 min. It was transferred to a Teflon-lined
hydrothermal stainless steel reactor. This reactor was then kept in
oven at the required temperature for a specific period. To obtain
a suspension, it was allowed to cool down to room temperature. This
suspension was washed with distilled water several times. It was then
centrifuged and dried at 120 °C for 24 h.

Metal Loading
Rh (1% w/w) was supported on OMS-2 by
the impregnation method as reported in our lab.35 OMS-2 was well dispersed in a beaker containing water,
using a magnetic stirrer. In another beaker, solution of RhCl3·3H2O was prepared, which was then added dropwise
to a beaker containing OMS-2 with vigorous stirring. This solution
was then stirred for next 6 h to remove any excess water, which was
evaporated at 60 °C. The mass was dried at 120 °C for 12
h, followed by calcination at 450 °C for 4 h.

Catalytic Reactions
Experiments were carried out in
a reactor of 50 mL capacity (Autoclave Engineers, Mumbai) provided
with a Rushton-type turbine impeller, pressure gauge, speed regulator,
and temperature controller. Prior to reaction, the catalyst sample
was freshly reduced using hydrogen at 40 atm for 2 h. In a typical
experiment, 0.0073 mol of furfural was charged into the reactor along
with 20 mL of methanol as a solvent and 50 μL of n-dodecane as an internal standard. The required amount of catalyst
was charged in the reactor, and the reactor was purged three times
with nitrogen and then by hydrogen. The reactor was then pressurized
with hydrogen at desired pressure, which was kept constant throughout
the studies. Once the desired temperature and pressure were obtained,
the reaction was carried out for 8 h and the samples were withdrawn
periodically and analyzed.

Analytical Method
Samples were analyzed
by gas chromatography
(GC, Chemito 1000), and the instrument was equipped with a DB-5HT
capillary column (0.10 μm × 0.25 mm × 30 m with 5%
(phenyl)-methylpolysiloxane packing) and FID. The product, 1,2-PeD,
was confirmed after matching the residence time of the standard using
GC–mass spectrometry (MS), with capillary column TG-5MS, Thermo
Scientific Trace 1300 ISQ LT (SI, Figure S1). The gas-phase analysis was performed using a GC 8610 unit equipped
with a Hayesep DB packed column. A thermal conductivity detector was
used for detecting H2, CH4, CO2,
CO, C2H6, etc. Nitrogen was used as a carrier
gas (SI, Figure S3).
