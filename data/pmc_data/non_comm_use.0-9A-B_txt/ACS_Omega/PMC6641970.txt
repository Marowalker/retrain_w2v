Limonene epoxide (1,2-limonene oxide)
readily reacts with carbon
dioxide inserted in a ring-opening copolymerization reaction and forms
polycarbonates of exceptional chemical and physical properties. Both
poly(limonene carbonate) and poly(limonene dicarbonate) can be synthesized
using low-cost Zn or Al homogeneous catalysts. This study addresses
selected relevant questions concerning the technical and economic
feasibility of limonene and carbon dioxide polymers en route to the
bioeconomy.

1 Introduction
Mostly extracted from
the orange peel prior to squeezing the fruit, d-limonene is a
cyclic monoterpene used in many different industrial sectors.1 The terpene is the main component of orange oil
derived by centrifugation of the oil–water emulsion (0.5–2%
in oil) obtained from the mechanical rupture of the fruit oil glands,
followed by oil capture with a stream of water vapor.2

The recent and current global demand of the resulting
cold-pressed
oil is so high that orange oil, once a byproduct of orange juice industry,
now generates financial revenues equal or even higher than selling
orange juice, at least for relatively small orange juice makers, such
as those existing in Sicily.

Remarkably, a spike in demand was
accompanied by decreasing supply
due to a disease (citrus greening) affecting orange plantations mostly
in Florida. As a result, the price of orange oil reached its highest
level in the summer of 2017 at $9.45/kg for bulk samples, with delivered
prices (adding shipping costs, duties, and intermediary traders’
margins) exceeding $12/kg.3

Limonene,
whose commercial availability has been assessed lately,4 replaces toxic volatile organic compounds, used
as industrial solvents, including those employed in the oil industry
to clean up the hull of ships engaged in remediation of oil spills
at sea. Yet, orange oil from organically grown orange crops finds
usages of much higher value, including employment as the main ingredient
to formulate broad scope and highly effective biopesticides.5

In this dramatically changing market context,
a number of new uses
of d-limonened as platform chemical were increasingly
reported starting in the early 2000s,1 including
one that, as noted lately by Poland and Darensbourg, “stalled
for over a decade”,6 namely, the
synthesis of poly(limonene carbonate) (PLC or PlimC) via the alternating
copolymerization of 1,2-limonene oxide, the trans isomer of the epoxide,
and CO2 mediated by a β-diiminate (BDI) Zn(II) catalyst.7

Since 2015, to quote Poland and Darensbourg
again, “a torrent
of new works has been published on the synthesis and uses of poly(limonene
carbonate) from research groups across the globe”,6 culminating in 2017 with the discovery of a new
copolymerization catalyst, an aminotriphenolate Al(III) complex, enabling
access to thermoplastic biobased polycarbonates of unprecedented thermal
resistance, including poly(limonene)dicarbonate (PLDC), with a high
glass-transition temperature (Tg) of 180
°C (for comparison, the main commercial polycarbonate, polycarbonate
from bisphenol-A (BPA), has a glass-transition temperature of 145
°C).8

Much of this work has
been highlighted by the general press also
due to the fact that limonene carbonates derived from d-limonene extracted from the citrus peel could, in principle, replace
petroleum-derived BPA-based polycarbonates. BPA indeed is a suspect
endocrine disruptor as well as a neurotoxic and carcinogenic agent
(a class 2B reproductive toxin for several food safety and health
organizations), whose polycarbonate to make baby bottles is banned
in countries as large as France and Turkey and whose carcinogenicity
status is currently being reconsidered.12

This study addresses several practical relevant questions
concerning
the technical and economic feasibility of limonene and carbon dioxide
polymers en route to the bioeconomy.

Is it realistic to expect
near-term commercialization of these
biobased polycarbonates? What are the main hurdles to overcome prior
to industrial manufacturing? Will limonene polymer production be inevitably
limited by the citrus oil supply? Which, if any, will be the first
practical application?

2 Limonene Carbonates
Discovered in the late 1960s by Inoue and co-workers in Japan,13 the ring-opening copolymerization of epoxides
with insertion of CO2 catalyzed by diethylzinc (ZnEt2) at room temperature under 50 atm CO2 provides
an alternative route to the phosgene process, by which, to date, 80–90%
of the ever-increasing amount of polycarbonates is produced yearly,14 even though highly successful productions of
polycarbonate from CO2 have been established and then rapidly
expanded in the 2000s.15

Plentiful
research efforts devoted to sustainable polycarbonates
from epoxide/CO2 copolymerization processes have been lately
reviewed by Poland and Darensbourg, including a thorough and comprehensive
discussion of advances concerning PLC and PLDC updated to August 2017.6

In 2016, the Coates’ catalytic synthesis
was optimized in
Germany to afford high-molecular-weight (>100 kDa) PLC in kilogram
amounts with further improved mechanical (hardness), thermal (Tg = 130 °C), and optical (higher transparency
than bisphenol-A polycarbonate) properties.9

Shortly afterward, the team led by Greiner discovered that
PLC
has excellent gas permeability to molecules such as CO2 and O2, making the biobased polycarbonate suitable to
manufacture new-generation windows for energy-efficient buildings
(the polymer is also a good heat insulator).10

The same team showed how chemical derivatization of the pendant
isoprene double bond of limonene moieties in each repeating unit of
the polymer allows the use of PLC as true polymeric platform system
(“synthetic toolbox”), from which several new properties
may arise,11 whereas the high molecular
rigidity and high hydrophobicity of PLC (contact angle to water of
94°) inhibit both enzymatic and hydrolytic degradation of the
polymer via depolymerization.

As mentioned above, Coates’
team in the United States discovered
in 2004 that enantiomerically pure PLC can be synthesized starting
from a mixture of (R)- and (S)-limonene
epoxide at room temperature under 6.8 atm CO2 and in the
presence of a β-diiminate zinc acetate complex (0.4 mol%) as
the catalyst.7 The catalyst polymerizes
the trans diastereomer of limonene oxide, leaving the cis diastereomer
unreacted, in an exquisite selectivity that excludes also the formation
of ether linkages.

In 2015, along with Auriemma and co-workers
in Italy, Coates reported
also the first example of co-crystallization of two amorphous enantiomeric
polymers in two specular polymeric chains (Scheme 1) by precipitating a 1:1 mixture of regio-
and stereoregular amorphous PLC copolymers, namely, poly(1S,2S,4R-limonene carbonate)
(PSLC) and poly(1R,2R,4S-limonene carbonate) (PRLC), dissolved in n-hexane.16

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Chiral PRLC and PSLC
Reproduced from ref (16), with kind permission.

The replacement of oil-derived oxirane with a
terpene-based epoxide,
such as 1,2-limonene oxide, configurates as a drop-in solution similar
to the highly desirable solutions in the chemical industry when dealing
with new catalytic productions proposed by researchers to renew synthetic
processes in use.17

The same holds
true for the oxidation protocol proposed by Kleij,
in which limonene oxide is copolymerized with CO2 with
a binary catalyst system composed of an aminotriphenolate Al(III)
complex combined with bis-triphenylphosphine iminium chloride (PPNCl)
to access different grades of PLC with molecular weights ranging from
1.3 to 15.1 kg/mol.8

To show the
simplicity of the process, limonene oxide (4 mL, cis/trans
mixture or solely the cis isomer), the Al catalyst (74 mg, 0.14 mmol),
and PPNCl (40 mg, 70 μmol) are mixed in a Teflon vessel placed
in a stainless steel reactor. The mixture is purged with CO2 3 times, eventually bringing the pressure at 15 bar, after which
the reactor heated to an inside temperature of 45 °C is left
to react for 48 h (Scheme 2).8 The PLC thereby obtained (1.74
g, 8.88 mmol of alkene units) is dissolved in CH2Cl2 (50 mL) and oxidized to poly(limonene-8,9-oxide carbonate)
(PLCO) with 3-chloroperbenzoic acid at 0 °C for 12 h.

of PLC Using the Process Developed by Kleij

In the optimized reaction
procedure, the latter epoxide is copolymerized
with carbon dioxide by simply using PPNCl as nucleophile for chloride-assisted
carboxylation (Scheme 3).

Vessel

to the Process Developed by Kleij
Reproduced
from ref (8), with
kind permission.

The white polymer composed
of poly(limonene)dicarbonate (PLDC)
thereby obtained has a Tg of 180 °C,
which is the highest among all CO2-derived polycarbonates
known so far, due to the highly rigid molecular structure.8 In general, the presence of epoxy and cyclic
carbonate groups in PLCO/PLDC, the team concluded, enables the design
of functional polymers via straightforward conversion of the oxirane/carbonate
units.

In the context of their research on nonisocyanate polyurethanes
(NIPUs), Mülhaupt and co-workers showed in 2012 how PLDC can
also be produced from limonene dioxide/CO2 copolymerization
using tetrabutylammonium bromide as homogeneous catalyst at 140 °C
under 30 bar CO2 pressure. The alkoxide ion formed following
the epoxy ring opening by the halide (Cl–) attacks
the CO2 molecule to afford the five-membered cyclic carbonate
ring. In contrast to NIPU based on seed oils, the absence of ester
groups in PLCO preventing unwanted reactions during amine curing and
the unprecedented high carbonate content in a rigid structure, eventually
affords NIPUs of high Young’s modulus, high glass-transition
temperature, and low elongation at break.18

These biobased polymers hold great potential for practical
utilization,
given both their excellent sustainability profile (with complete back-to-monomer
recyclability)19 and a vast scope of potential
applications, which include protecting coatings,20 breathing-glass windows,10 and
the addition of permanent antibacterial activity and hydrophilization.11

Prior to that, however, the main hurdle
to their large-scale commercialization,
the limited supply of limonene, needs to be overcome.

3 New Routes to Limonene
According to Ruzicka’s 1953
classification of terpenoids
based on the number of isoprene units from which they are biogenetically
derived (isoprene rule),21 limonene along
with geraniol, linalool, menthol, and camphor belongs to monoterpenoids
(C10, Figure 1), volatile
biological compounds present in numerous plants.

Figure 1 Monoterpenoids (C10)
derived from two isoprene units. (Adapted
from ref (27), with

Formed by head-to-tail condensation
of isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate, the activated
form of isoprene units, geranyl diphosphate (GPP), is the precursor
of d-limonene as well as of linalool and geraniol.22

Limonene synthase (the water-soluble enzyme
present in the orange
flavedo)22 is the terpenoid synthase catalyzing
cyclization and formation of limonene via a carbocationic driven mechanism
common to all terpenoid synthases23 in
which, specifically, GPP is isomerized to linalyl diphosphate, followed
by C1 repositioning prior to addition to the C6–C7 double bond
to eventually form the cyclized α-terpinyl cation (Schemes 3 and 4), which,
following methyl group deprotonation, yields limonene.24

Cation

Figure 2 shows that
the 14 year average (red line) supply of orange oil has been around
57 000 tons, with a 9000 tons shortage in 2016/2017 due to
constant decline of Florida’s production hit by citrus greening
disease.

As it happened with triterpenoid
squalene, which is currently mostly
obtained from sugarcane fermentation rather than from shark liver
oil or from olive oil distillates,25 the
bottleneck of limited supply of limonene needs to be solved by innovation
in biotechnology.

The first approach attempted was to use engineered
microorganisms
as a cell factory to produce terpenoids from cheap and readily available
glucose.26 However, although engineering
yeast metabolism has been successful to produce several terpenoids
in such high yield to become commercial,27 limonene is highly toxic to microbes limiting its concentration
in fermentation broths to very low levels (i.e., 2.7 g/L of l-limonene over recombinant Escherichia coli from glycerol as carbon source).28

In agreement with what Beekwilder and co-workers wrote in 2016,26 such limonene titer values would need to increase
2 orders of magnitude to reach the current prices of citrus limonene.

That lately reported by Bowie and co-workers, producing limonene
from the free enzymes rather than from whole cells in unprecedented
high yield is therefore a breakthrough holding the potential to open
the route to large-scale production of limonene from low-cost and
overly abundant sugars.29

In detail,
the team designed a system comprising 27 enzymes for
the conversion of glucose into monoterpenes. Different monoterpenes
(limonene, pinene, and sabinene) could be produced from GPP by changing
the terpene synthase enzyme, which, in the case of limonene, is limonene
synthase extracted from the orange peel.

Operated continuously
for 7 days, the reaction affords stable production
of limonene from a single addition of glucose with a total yield of
ca. 90%, pointing to moderate loss of carbon due to side reactions
and a limonene titer of 12.5 g/L, which is more than 2 times higher
than the toxicity limit of limonene for E. coli or Saccharomyces cerevisiae varying
between 0.02 and 0.5% (5 g/L).

4 New Routes to Limonene Oxide
Currently obtained by a reaction of limonene with an organic peroxide,
1,2-limonene oxide is the biobased building block, whose trans and
cis diastereoisomers copolymerize with CO2, respectively,
in the Coates’ and Kleij’s syntheses of PLC.

In
light of forthcoming applications of limonene polycarbonates,
a green and selective new route toward cis- and trans-limonene epoxides
would be highly desirable. Indeed, a recent thorough life cycle analysis
of the individual stages of the PLC production process found that
the use of an equimolar amount of tert-butyl hydroperoxide
to convert limonene into LO in an epoxidation reaction catalyzed by
Ti(OiPr)4 bound to silica (75%
conversion and 88% selectivity at room temperature) has “a
significant negative impact on the overall process despite its low
quantities”.30 The team concluded
that more research is needed to develop a clean alternative limonene
oxidation route.

One such new process makes use of organically
modified crystalline
TiO2 obtained by silylation of photocatalytic P25 commercial
titania used for photocatalytic degradation of pollutants. The resulting
catalytic material selectively mediates the aerobic epoxidation to
1,2-limonene oxide under solar light irradiation.31

A mechanism explaining the remarkable selectivity
observed involves
singlet oxygen 1O2 generated through energy
transfer from the surface of the organically modified semiconductor
to the O2 molecules adsorbed at the catalyst’s outer
surface (Scheme 5).

Scheme 5 Oxidation of Limonene in the Presence of Silylated TiO2 (R = C16H33)
Although
anchoring may occur
through all of the three methoxy groups of the silane, only one oxygen
bridge per silane molecule has been depicted for the sake of clarity.

5 Forthcoming
Applications
Writing about the solar economy in the early
2000s,32 Scheer, a long-time and successful
advocate
of solar energy, argued that in such forthcoming economy, “real
biotechnology” would be used to convert plant sources (“solar
raw materials”) into the useful products we obtain today starting
from petroleum-based feedstock. Energy, in its turn, will originate
from renewable energy sources (RES).

Almost 2 decades later,
Germany obtained 36.5% of its huge electricity
demand in 2017 from RES,33 showing that
the transition to 100% renewable energy even in large industrial economies
is no longer an unrealistic dream of environmental activists, although
still requiring significant advances in energy-storage technologies.34

Achievements in the transition from the
oil-based to the biobased
chemical industry, however, lag much behind. For decades, the only
large-scale chemical bioproduction has been bioethanol fuel obtained
via yeast fermentation of sugarcane sugars in Brazil and maize starch
in the United States. Eventually, the glycerol surplus created as
byproduct of biodiesel led in 2007 to the first large-scale chemical
production of a key plastic (epoxy resin) precursor, epoxide epichlorohydrin,
from a biological resource.35

The
single largest product of the petrochemical industry is indeed
plastics, with most of the 322 million tons produced in 2015 being
obtained from oil-derived feedstocks.36 The industry, furthermore, has grown at a striking 8.6% compound
annual growth rate from 1950 to 2015, with polycarbonate being one
of the most lucrative segments forecasted to grow at a similar fast
pace (of almost 7% up to 2024), with nearly half of the overall consumption
in transportation, electrical, and electronics sectors and the remainder,
thanks to optical clarity, to make headlamps, face shields, laminates,
and windshields.37

This is a highly
competitive (and huge) market in which poly(limonene
carbonates) would enter once produced on commercial scale. The current
supply of citrus limonene, coupled to high and increasing price (Figure 3), however, prevents
large-scale bioplastics productions based on limonene, leaving room
for selected advanced applications in which the superior properties
of PLC and PLDC may justify the use of an expensive and rare monomer,
such as limonene.

Figure 3 Price of d-limonene, gum turpentine,
pine oil,
and other terpenes in the 2007–2017 decade. For comparison,
also the price of petroleum is displayed. (Image courtesy of Fabio
Thomazelli, Citrosuco, 2018).

In other words, given the superior mechanical, thermal, optical,
and chemical properties of limonene-based polycarbonates, the first
applications of PLC and PLDC will likely start to materialize in high-revenue
advanced uses, where conventional polycarbonates derived from oil-based
platform chemicals cannot compete in terms of properties.

Furthermore,
given the high value of PLC and PLDC rigid, heat-resistant,
and transparent resins, we forecast that three-dimensional printing
of poly(limonene carbonate) bioplastics, similar to that lately pioneered
by Ananikov’s team,38 will advantageously
be used to manufacture functional goods for advanced applications.

One of the first applications of PLC might be as glazing material.
Greiner, Hauenstein, and co-workers suggested that this could occur
in the construction industry to make new-generation windows and greenhouses,10 since, compared to the main commercial glazing
materials (BPA-polycarbonate, poly(methyl methacrylate), and soda
lime glass), PLC has similarly excellent optical clarity, but it is
the lightest material (specific gravity) and is 1 (with respect to
BPA-polycarbonate) or 2 (with respect to poly(methyl methacrylate))
orders of magnitude more permeable than O2 and CO2 gas molecules.39

Another key application
of limonene polycarbonates, especially
of PLDC as lately shown again by Mülhaupt’s team,40 will be in the manufacturing of nonisocyanate
polyurethanes, namely, a polyurethane prepared by the reaction of
cyclocarbonates (which do not contain ester groups, which can interfere
with the amine curing and amine advancement reactions) and amines
without use of phosgene or of toxic isocyanates of improved mechanical,
thermal, and chemical resistance compared to conventional polyurethanes.

Another advanced application will be in the field of functional
coatings use, as pioneered by Hauenstein and Greiner, who first successfully
demonstrated new antibacterial, mechanical, thermal, self-healing,
and new protective coating properties for different PLC-derived polymers
obtained by thiol-ene chemistry derivatization of the double bond
of the limonene moiety.11

Pointing
to emerging industrial interest, the use of PLC cross-linked
by thiol-ene reaction with trimethylolpropane tris(3-mercaptopropionate)
affording promising solvent-resistant and scratch-resistant coatings20 has seen the involvement of a large coatings
company (DSM).

Asked to comment on the forthcoming possible
introduction of PLC
and PLDC in industrial products, Professor Kleij responded: “clear
opportunities exist to use the poly(limonene)carbonate and poly(limonene)dicarbonate
technologies as drop-in solutions, i.e., the rigidity and functionality
of the limonene (oxide) monomer makes it an attractive monomer for
existing polycarbonates while replacing (partially) fossil fuel based
monomers such as propylene oxide and BPA, and to design new and improved
materials”.41

6 Outlook
and Perspective
Whether obtained from citrus peel, as it
happens today, or from
sugar fermentation as it will shortly happen, d-limonene
is an eminent bioproduct deriving from plants, whose existence ultimately
relies on photosynthesis. Hence, limonene polycarbonates obtained
from polymerization of d-limonene oxide(s) and CO2 ideally retrieved from the air are an eminent example of
polymers of the emerging solar economy, namely, the economy in which
both energy and functional materials currently mostly derived from
oil will rather be derived from renewable energy sources and renewable
feedstock abundant in nature. In this epochal shift, which is eventually
taking place, the role of chemistry and chemical innovation, such
as that briefly summarized in this account, will be of paramount importance.42

From the manufacturing viewpoint, the
recent accelerated progress
makes possible the production of enantiomerically pure poly(limonene
carbonates) of high molecular weight using either one of the two catalysts
active in limonene oxide/CO2 copolymerization relying on
abundant and low-cost Zn and Al metals and easily synthesized ligands,
namely, β-diiminate zinc and aminotriphenolate aluminum/PPNCl
complexes.

The relatively low CO2 reaction pressures
(6–20
bar) and low temperatures employed (up to 73 °C) mean that no
costly and hazardous high-pressure equipment is required for the manufacture
of limonene carbonates.

Remarkably, furthermore, the catalysts
are complementary. The zinc
catalysts are sensitive to moisture and selectively mediate the copolymerization
of the trans isomer of 1,2-limonene oxide, whereas the aminotriphenolate
aluminum/PPNCl species is insensitive to water and catalyzes the polymerization
of the cis isomer.

The main hurdle to be overcome is the limited
supply of citrus
limonene. The cell-free, multienzyme synthetic biochemistry approach
to limonene synthesis from sugars pioneered by Bowie and co-workers,29 however, holds significant potential to open
the route to the commercial production of monoterpenes from glucose,
leaving the orange oil yearly supply available for high-value uses
as key ingredient to formulate fragrance, cosmetic, personal care,
and biopesticide products.1

The second
need, lately emphasized by Li and Koning, calls for
“a one-pot, two-step reaction”,43 in which the copolymerization catalyst is added to the reaction
mixture containing the limonene epoxide directly after the limonene
epoxidation reaction.

The latter requirement may be met by shifting
the solar-driven
photocatalytic aerobic epoxidation process from batch to flow, using
new-generation flow chemistry systems combining the advantages of
heterogeneous catalysis in batch with the benefits of flow photochemistry.44

Once the main practical issues identified
in this study are addressed,
limonene polycarbonates, true polymers of the solar bioeconomy, will
become ubiquitous.
