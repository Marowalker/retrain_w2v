Human
UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (hUGDH) oxidizes uridine diphosphate
(UDP)-glucose to UDP-glucuronic acid, an essential substrate in the
phase II metabolism of drugs. The activity of hUGDH is controlled
by an atypical allosteric mechanism in which the feedback inhibitor
UDP-xylose competes with the substrate for the active site and triggers
a buried allosteric switch to produce an inactive complex (EΩ). Previous comparisons with a nonallosteric UGDH identified six
large-to-small substitutions that produce packing defects in the protein
core and provide the conformational flexibility necessary for the
allosteric transition. Here, we test the hypothesis that these large-to-small
substitutions form a motif that can be used to identify allosteric
UGDHs. Caenorhabditis elegans UGDH
(cUGDH) conserves this motif with the exception of an Ala-to-Pro substitution
in position 109. The crystal structures of unliganded and UDP-xylose
bound cUGDH show that the A109P substitution is accommodated by an
Asn-to-Ser substitution at position 290. Steady-state analysis and
sedimentation velocity studies show that the allosteric transition
is conserved in cUGDH. The enzyme also exhibits hysteresis in progress
curves and negative cooperativity with respect to NAD+ binding.
Both of these phenomena are conserved in the human enzyme, which is
strong evidence that these represent fundamental features of atypical
allostery in UGDH. A phylogenetic analysis of UGDH shows that the
atypical allostery motif is ancient and identifies a potential transition
point in the evolution of the UGDH family.

Introduction
The nucleotide sugar
uridine diphosphate-α-d-glucuronic
acid (UDP-GlcA) is the essential substrate of glucuronidation, a major
mechanism of drug metabolism in mammals.1−3 Some cancers have been
shown to exploit glucuronidation as a means of chemotherapeutic resistance.4−7 Limiting the availability of UDP-GlcA represents a novel strategy
for combatting this drug-resistance mechanism.8−10 UDP-GlcA is
produced by UDP-α-d-glucose 6-dehydrogenase (UGDH),
which catalyzes the NAD+-dependent oxidation of UDP-α-d-glucose (UDP-Glc). In humans, human UDP-glucose dehydrogenase
(hUGDH) is a hexamer that is allosterically regulated by the downstream
metabolite UDP-α-d-xylose (UDP-Xyl) (Figure 1A).11,12 Understanding the allosteric mechanism of hUGDH is an important
step toward the design of therapeutics that can reduce the cellular
levels of UDP-GlcA.

Figure 1 Allosteric transition in hUGDH. (A) Hexameric hUGDH forms
from
the association of three dimers. The allosteric switch (magenta),
NAD+ binding (NB) domain (cyan), dimerization domain (green),
and nucleotide–sugar binding (SB) domain (red) are identified.
(B) In the inactive E* state, the NB and SB domains adopt an “open”
conformation (curved arrows). The binding of the substrate (green
spheres) induces the formation of the active, E state,
while UDP-Xyl (red spheres) produces the inactive, horseshoe-shaped
EΩ complex. (C) The E and EΩ conformations
of the allosteric switch (magenta). The packing defects in the protein
core are colored cyan. In the E state, a water molecule (red sphere)
forms hydrogen bonds with the C5′CH2OH of UDP-Glc
and Thr131 of the allosteric switch. UDP-Xyl lacks the C5’CH2OH, which triggers the allosteric switch to produce the EΩ state. (D) The atypical allostery motif residues (orange
boxes) previously hypothesized17 to facilitate
allostery in UGDH.

In the absence of any
ligand, the three dimers of hUGDH form a
weakly associated hexamer called E* (Figure 1A,B).13−20 The E* hexamer slowly isomerizes to the active E state upon binding
the substrate, which produces a lag in progress curves (hysteresis).15 The activity of hUGDH is regulated by an atypical
allosteric mechanism.13−15,18,19 What makes this atypical is that the effector (UDP-Xyl) competes
with the substrate for the active site. Upon binding, the UDP-Xyl
triggers the Thr131-loop/α6-helix (the allosteric switch) to
change the conformation, which allosterically increases the affinity
of adjacent dimers and produces an inactive horseshoe-shaped complex
(EΩ) (Figure 1A,B).13,14,17−19 This allosteric transition can also be observed as
positive cooperativity in inhibition studies.13−15,18

The Thr131-loop of the allosteric switch is
buried in the protein
core and must change the conformation for the enzyme to transition
between the E and EΩ states (Figure 1C). The remarkable plasticity of the protein
core originates from packing defects (cavities and deep surface pockets)
that provide flexibility and space for the allosteric transition (Figure 1C).13,14,17 Comparing hUGDH to the nonallosteric
homolog from Streptococcus pyogenes (spUGDH), it was shown that the packing defects evolved from six
large-to-small residue substitutions in the protein core (Figure 1D). It was hypothesized17 that these substitutions could be used as a
sequence motif to identify other UGDHs that exhibit atypical allostery.
Here, we have tested that hypothesis using Caenorhabditis
elegans UGDH (cUGDH), which shares 61% sequence identity
with hUGDH but has a single substitution in one of the allosteric
motif residues (A109P) (Figures 1D and 2). In the human enzyme,
we have previously shown that the A109L substitution in this motif
abolishes allostery.14 Here, we that show
that cUGDH conserves the allosteric transition. The crystal structure
shows that the A109P substitution is accommodated by a second N290S
mutation. In addition, we observe both hysteresis and negative cooperativity
with respect to NAD+ binding (which has also been reported
in the human enzyme).13,14,16,18 We suggest that the conservation of both
hysteresis and negative cooperativity is good evidence that these
phenomena are defining characteristics of atypical allostery in UGDH.
Prior to this work, atypical allostery had only identified in the
human enzyme. By combining structural and kinetic studies with a phyologenetic
analysis, we shed light on the evolution of atypical allostery in
UGDH.

Results
cUGDH
Forms the EΩ State
The defining
feature of the allosteric transition is the formation of the horseshoe-shaped
complex in the presence of UDP-Xyl (Figure 1B).17 The crystal
structure of cUGDH in complex with UDP-Xyl (cUGDH/UDP-Xyl) was solved
and refined to a resolution of 2.45 Å (Figure 3A,B and Table 3). The asymmetric unit contains 12 chains that are
structurally equivalent, with a small number of disordered residues
at the N- and C-termini (≤7 and ≤11 residues, respectively).
Each chain of cUGDH also contains a well-ordered molecule of UDP-Xyl
in the active site, which conserves all of the same ligand interactions
previously described for the human enzyme (Figure 3C,D). In addition, there is a second molecule
of UDP-Xyl bound in the NAD+ binding site that is most
likely an artefact of the high UDP-Xyl concentrations (1 mM) in the
crystallization buffer (not shown); at high concentrations, UDP-Xyl
is known to bind promiscuously to the NAD+ site in hUGDH.18

The cUGDH structure superimposes 453 corresponding
Cα atoms
onto hUGDH (PDB entry 3PTZ) with an rmsd of 0.7 Å and sequence identity
of 61%. The domain structure is assigned based on homology to the
human enzyme: NAD+ binding domain (NB; res. 1-219), dimerization
domain (DD; res. 220-329), and sugar-binding domain (SB; res. 330-481)
(Figure 2). The application
of crystallographic symmetry shows that all 12 chains of cUGDH assemble
into horseshoe-shaped hexamers, similar to the UDP-Xyl bound EΩ state17 observed in the
human enzyme (Figure 3B). The largest difference between the cUGDH and hUGDH EΩ hexamers involves a 5.6° larger rigid body rotation of adjacent
dimers, which produces a wider opening in the cUGDH ‘horseshoe’
complex.

UDP-Xyl Binding Induces Formation of the EΩ Hexamer
The UDP-Xyl binding allosterically stabilizes the
UGDH hexamer in the solution.17,19,20 Sedimentation velocity analysis of 9 μM unliganded cUGDH revels
a c(s) distribution consisting of
an 11.2 S (68.5%), 8.3 S (8.7%), 5.6 S (21.6%), and 3.3 S (1.2%) species
(Figure 4A). This is
consistent with the distribution of the hUGDH unliganded E* state,
which exists as a mixture of hexamers, tetramers, and dimers in rapid
equilibrium under identical conditions.13,14,17−20 The 3.3 S species likely represents a small amount
of the misfolded monomer, which is also observed in sedimentation
velocity studies with hUGDH.13,14,17−20 The cUGDH hexamer (11.2 S) appears to be slightly smaller than the
predicted value (11.5 S), which is likely a result of the fact that
in a rapid-equilibrium system, the modeled S-values are biased by
the mean of the distribution.21,22 The addition of 80
μM UDP-Xyl shifts the distribution to a single 11.6 S species,
which is nearly identical to the expected S value (11.7 S) of the
EΩ state, horseshoe-shaped hexameric complex (Figure 4B).

the formation of the EΩ state. (A) Sedimentation
velocity analysis of unliganded cUGDH reveals
a distribution corresponding to a (M)onomer, (D)imer, (T)etramer,
and (H)examer species. (B) UDP-Xyl shifts the distribution to a single

switch (Cα trace with Thr136 in sticks) in the E* (cyan) and
EΩ (red) states are similar to the equivalent structural
states of hUGDH (gray).

To understand how the
A109P substitution was accommodated during
the allosteric transition, we conducted a detailed structural analysis
on a 1.88 Å resolution unliganded crystal structure of the cUGDH
32 symmetry hexamer that was deposited by the New York SGX Research
Center for Structural Genomics (unpublished, PDB: 2O3J) (Figure 4C). The NB and SB domains of
the unliganded cUGDH subunits have rotated to an open conformation
(∼11 and ∼5°, respectively) relative to the EΩ hexamer (Figure 4D). This open domain conformation resembles the E* state of
hUGDH, which represents an intermediate in the allosteric transition
from E to EΩ (Figure 1B).13−15 The Thr136-Loop/α6-helix (allosteric switch)
in cUGDH was identified based on homology with the human enzyme (Figure 2). A comparison of
the unliganded cUGDH structure with the human enzyme confirms that
the allosteric switch is in the E* conformation (Figure 4E). This analysis also shows
that cUGDH and hUGDH undergo a similar conformational change in the
transition from the E* and EΩ states (Figure 4E).17,19 The only significant difference in the Thr136-Loop portion of the
allosteric switch involves the conserved residue Val139 (cUGDH numbering)
(Figure 5A). In cUGDH,
the side chain of Val139 is weakly ordered and is modeled in the gauche+,
gauche-, and trans rotamers in the different peptides of the crystal
structure, while in hUGDH, the side chain is in the trans conformation
(−170°). The rotational disorder of the valine appears
to be in response to the bulky pyrrolidine ring of Pro109, which displaces
the Val139 Cα atom by 1.4 Å relative to the human enzyme.
This displacement also induces the conserved residue Leu228 to change
rotamers (Figure 5A).
The largest conformational difference between the enzymes involves
the α6-helix; in the allosteric transition from the E* hexamer
to the EΩ complex, the cUGDH helix rotates by 14
± 3° but only 6 ± 2° in the human enzyme (Figure 5B). The difference
in rotation originates from several changes in the packing interactions
between the α6-helix and the groove formed between the α5-helix
and the β6-strand. First, the Cβ atom of Ala141 and the
Cγ atom of Val114 are ∼4.7 Å apart, which creates
a small void that weakens the packing of the α6-helix in cUGDH
(Figure 5C). In hUGDH,
Val114 is replaced with an isoleucine, which fills the void with a
Cδ atom and packs tightly against the alanine. Another significant
change involves an alanine-to-serine substitution at position 118
in cUGDH, which is buried in a hydrophobic pocket where it weakens
a hydrogen bond in the α5-helix by competing for the main-chain
carbonyl oxygen of Val114 (Figure 5D). The most significant change in the α6-helix
involves Ala152 in cUGDH, which packs into a buried hydrophobic cluster
formed by Ala122, Leu149, and Phe161 (Figure 5E). In the human enzyme, the hydrophobic
cluster is maintained with conservative substitutions, but Ala152
is replaced by an asparagine (Asn147 in hUGDH, Figure 5E). As a result, the C-terminus of the α6-helix
in hUGDH has locally unfolded to expose the Asn to the solvent. There
is also a two-residue insertion in the loop following the α6-helix
in cUGDH, but it does not appear to contribute directly to the change
in the helix rotation (Figures 2 and 5E).

Figure 5 Structural divergence

substitution in cUGDH displaces the Val139 (magenta), which causes
Leu228 to change rotamer relative to hUGDH (gray). (B) The α6-helix
in the EΩ conformation of cUGDH (magenta, cyan) is
rotated more than that observed in hUGDH. (C) Val114 (cyan) replaces

(magenta) are identified. (D) Ser118 of cUGDH (cyan) replaces an alanine

packing of the α6-helix of cUGDH (magenta) against the α5-helix
and β6-strand (cyan) compared to the hUGDH (gray). cUGDH contains
an insertion that lengthens the α6-helix (orange). (F) Stereoview
of changes in the packing interactions that form the hexamer-building
interface of cUGDH (colored by domain; NB: cyan, allosteric switch:
magenta, dimerization domain: green, and SB: red). hUGDH is colored
gray.

The hexamer-building interface
was examined to determine the origin
of the increased rotation of the α6-helix in cUGDH (Figure 5F and Supporting
Information Figure 1). The most significant differences involve the conserved residues
Phe330 and Pro440, both of which pack directly against the α6-helix.
In cUGDH, Phe330 adopts a χ1 torsion angle of −69°
and packs against the α6-helix residue Cys147 (Figure 5F). In contrast, Cys147 is
replaced with an arginine in the human enzyme, which forces the corresponding
Phe into a strained, weakly ordered rotamer of −102°.
The conserved residues Glu143 and Ser144 change conformations to produce
a complementary packing surface for Phe330 in each enzyme. The conserved
residue Pro440 is also displaced by ∼1.9 Å relative to
the human enzyme (Figure 5F). This shift is a consequence of the altered α6-helix
conformation and the replacement of alanine by Glu151 in cUGDH.

Atypical Allostery Motif in cUGDH
With the exception
of the alanine-to-proline substitution at position 109, hUGDH and
cUGDH conserve the atypical allostery motif and most of the associated
packing defects in the EΩ hexamer (cavity C-1Ω and deep surface pockets D-1Ω and
D-2Ω) (Figures 2 and 6A–C). In hUGDH,
the main-chain amide of the alanine forms a hydrogen bond with the
carboxamide of an asparagine (Asn283, human numbering) (Figure 6D). The proline substitution
in cUGDH removes the amide, which would break the hydrogen bond (Figure 6E). As a result,
the selective pressure on the asparagine is relaxed, and it has been
replaced with Ser290, which forms a hydrogen bond with an ordered
water molecule in the deep surface pocket D-2Ω. The
pyrrolidine ring of Pro109 also alters the structure of the deep surface
pocket D-1Ω by introducing a steric clash that induces
the rotameric changes in Val139 and Leu228 that were described in
the previous section (Figure 5A). The only other change in D-1Ω involves
Val114, which replaces an isoleucine in the human enzyme.

(E) In cUGDH, the alanine and asparagine are replaced with a Pro109
and Ser290, respectively. Ser290 forms a hydrogen bond with a water
molecule (red sphere).

cUGDH Conserves Hysteresis
and Cooperativity
The atypical
allosteric hUGDH undergoes a slow, substrate-induced isomerization
from the inactive E* to the active E state, which can be observed
as a lag in progress curves.13 The cUGDH
progress curves also display a similar hysteresis, with a lag that
is ∼30% shorter than that observed in hUGDH (Figure 7A,B). The kinetic parameters
for cUGDH were determined using the steady-state velocities derived
from Frieden’s equation for the enzyme hysteresis.23 The NAD+ saturation curve exhibits
negative cooperativity (Hill coefficient = 0.82), with a K0.5 and kcat of 333 μM
and 1.7 s–1, respectively (Figure 7C and Table 1). This is comparable to the NAD+ negative
cooperativity in saturation curves that has previously been reported15–16,20 for the human enzyme (Figure 7D and Table 1). In contrast, the UDP-Glc saturation curve is hyperbolic, with
a KM and kcat of 55 μM and 1.2 s–1, respectively (Figure 7E and Table 1). The lower kcat is a result of the negative cooperativity associated
with NAD+ binding, which makes it difficult to saturate
cUGDH with co-enzyme to achieve pseudo-first-order conditions.13,14,16

Substrate cooperativity in the presence of saturating UDP-Xyl has
been observed in hUGDH and is strong evidence of the allosteric transition
from a low UDP-Glc affinity EΩ complex to a higher
UDP-Glc affinity E hexamer.13−15,18 Steady-state analysis of UDP-Xyl inhibition yields a Ki of 6.9 μM, which corresponds to a ∼16-fold
weaker affinity for the inhibitor than that seen in hUGDH (Figure 7E,F and Table 2). The cUGDH UDP-Glc

of 15 μM UDP-Xyl (Hill coefficient of 1.4) (Figure 7E and Table 2).

Evolutionary
Analysis of Atypical Allostery in UGDH
The evolution of atypical
allostery in UGDH was examined using over
70 000 sequences. A phylogenetic tree of 31 representative
UGDH sequences from diverse eukaryotic and prokaryotic phyla is shown
in Figure 8. Based
on overall sequence similarity and taxonomic representation, these
31 sequences can be broadly classified into 8 clades. Since the dendrogram
shown in Figure 8 is
a gene tree and not a species tree, taxonomically diverse species
such as bacteria and protists often fall in different clades.24,25 Here, our definition of clades is based on the overall similarity
of full-length UGDH sequences. The nature of amino acids present in
the atypical allostery motif (including the newly defined S/N290 position)
was compared across phyla (Figure 8). Although both the atypical allosteric motif residues
and the packing defect residues are generally conserved across the
eukaryotic and prokaryotic phyla (clades 1–7), they are strikingly
different in the nonallosteric S. pyogenes clade (clade 8), which was used as an outgroup (see methods) (Figures 8 and 9). If a clade contains a single, conservative variation, then
it is identified as likely allosteric, but if there are significant
changes, then it is assumed to be nonallosteric (Figure 9). Sequences in clades 1–2
strictly conserve the allosteric motif residues, while notable variations
are observed in clades 3–7. In clade 3, the Capsaspora phylum
absolutely conserves the motif, while the Platyhelminthes substitute
a serine for the alanine at position 141. The impact of the serine
is likely to be negligible since the Oγ would point into the
deep surface pocket D-2Ω, which is large enough to
accomodate a water molecule for hydrogen bonding. In clades 5–8,
we observe the persistent conservation of a Thr substitution in position
141. This is most pronounced in the Stramenopiles, Bacillariophyta,
and Phaeophyceae phyla of clade 5, where the Thr141 substitution represents
the only significant variation in either the atypical motif or packing
defect residues. In contrast, the remaining phyla of clade 5 also
contain a tryptophan substitution in the packing defect residue position
114, which will likely introduce significant clashes in the inhibited
state of the enzyme. In clade 6, the protist Parasabalia clusters
with bacterial phyla Lentisphaerae, Cyanobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia.
The grouping of protists and bacteria in gene dendrograms has previously
been observed in other gene families and is often attributed to lateral
gene transfer between protists and bacteria.26 The Ascomycota (clade 7) contain a leucine substitution at position
109, which is interesting because the equivalent substitution in the
human enzyme has been shown to eliminate allostery by introducing
steric clashes in the deep surface pocket D-2Ω. In
general, the overall conservation of the motif residues in fungal
and cyanobacterial clades (clades 6,7) suggests that the atypical
allosteric mechanism is likely ancient and evolved progressively in
higher eukaryotes (clades 1,2) (Figure 9). Because of the specificity for UDP-Xyl, it is unlikely
that the atypical allosteric inhibition mechanism would be present
in the UGDHs of organisms that do not produce this nucleotide–sugar.
Unfortunately, data concerning the distribution of UDP-Xyl throughout
various phyla is poorly characterized and incomplete.

Figure 8 Phylogenetic analysis
of UGDH. Using taxonomically diverse UGDH
sequences, the evolution of UGDH was followed. This analysis distinguishes
eight distinct clades of UGDH based on the overall similarity of full-length
UGDH sequences. The long branch lengths of the nonallosteric outgroup
(clade 8) indicate that these phyla contain highly divergent UGDHs.
Bootstrap values are indicated.

Figure 9 Representive
sequences from each phyla in the evolutionary analysis
of UGDH. Residues that make up the allosteric sequence motif (orange
stars) and the packing defects (bold black lettering) or simply adjacent
in the sequence (light gray). The prediction of allostery in the UGDHs
that comprise clades 3–7 is purely speculative (see the text
for details). Within each clade, the phyla that are expected to be
allosteric are shown in black. If it is unknown whether or not a specific
phylum conserves the allosteric mechanism, it is colored blue along
with the questionable substitutions. If a specific phylum is expected
to be nonallosteric, it is colored red along with the questionable
substitutions that are unlikely to be accommodated in the EΩ structure.

Discussion
What
makes allostery in UGDH atypical is that the feedback inhibitor
competes with the substrate for the active site to trigger a transition
to the EΩ state (Figure 1B).15,17 Key to this remarkable
transition is the atypical allostery motif, which identifies a series
of large-to-small amino acid substitutions that produce the packing
defects in the protein core that are necessary to accommodate both
the E and EΩ conformations of the buried allosteric
switch (Figures 4E
and 6A–C).14,17 This motif is conserved in cUGDH with the exception of an alanine
to proline substitution in position 109 (Figure 2). In an early study with the human enzyme,
it was shown that a leucine substitution at the equivalent position
abolished allostery.14 Here, we show that
despite the A109P substitution, the crystal structure of cUGDH/UDP-Xyl
still forms the allosterically inhibited EΩ hexamer
(Figure 3B). The structure
also suggests a reason for why Ser290 is replaced with an asparagine
in hUGDH (Figure 6D,E).
There, the asparagine forms a hydrogen bond with the main-chain amide
of the alanine in position 109 of the atypical motif (Ala104 in hUGDH)
(Figure 6D,E). The
Pro109 substitution in cUGDH removes the amide, which relaxes the
selective pressure on the asparagine and allows the Ser290 substitution.

A comparison of the E* and EΩ cUGDH structures
shows that the allosteric switch undergoes a conformational change
similar to that observed in the human enzyme but with a larger rotation
of α6-helix (Figures 4E and 5B). It has been shown that changes
in the conformation of the α6-helix can affect the stability
of the hUGDH hexamer and the affinity for UDP-Xyl.13,14,17 Here, we have shown that the E* state of
cUGDH is a weakly associated hexamer, while the allosterically inhibited
enzyme forms a stable EΩ complex, similar to the
human enzyme (Figure 4A,B).17,18 However, the UDP-Xyl affinity of cUGDH is
∼16-fold weaker than that of the human enzyme, despite the
fact that both enzymes conserve the same interactions in the binding
site (Table 2 and Figure 3D). Since UDP-Xyl
is coupled with the hexamer-building interface through the allosteric
switch, it is likely that the changes in the rotation of the α6-helix
are responsible for the reduced affinity (Figure 4B).

Hysteresis and allostery have been
shown to be coupled in hUGDH.13−15,17 Our observation of hysteresis
in cUGDH suggests that this is a defining characteristic of the atypical
allosteric mechanism (Figure 7A,B). The allosteric transition can be observed as positive
cooperativity in steady-state inhibition studies (Figure 7E,F and Table 2). Briefly, the EΩ conformation
has low affinity for the substrate UDP-Glc (Figure 1D).15,17 As UDP-Glc outcompetes
the inhibitor, the enzyme allosterically switches to the high substrate
affinity E state, resulting in a sigmoidal substrate saturation curve.
Both hUGDH and cUGDH also display negative cooperativity with respect
to NAD+ binding (Figure 7C,D and Table 1). The negative cooperativity in hUGDH is poorly understood
at a structural level, but it is known to originate from a substrate-induced
asymmetry in the enzyme. Negative cooperativity is believed to be
linked to the allosteric mechanism, because amino acid substitutions
that disrupt allostery also abolish negative cooperativity.13,14 The conservation of negative cooperativity in cUGDH strongly suggests
that this phenomenon is also a defining characteristic of the atypical
allosteric mechanism.

To obtain new insights into the evolution
of allostery in UGDH,
we have examined the patterns of conservation and variation in the
atypical allostery motif residues across diverse species (Figures 8 and 9). Phyla that conserve Ala109 also conserve Asn290, supporting
our hypothesis that these residues may have co-evolved. Because the
dendrogram shown in Figure 8 is a gene tree and not a species tree, taxonomically diverse
species such as bacteria and protists often fall in different clades,
which are based only on the overall similarity of full-length UGDH
sequences.24,25 UGDHs in higher eukaryotes (clades
1–3) generally conserve the motif residues and are likely to
be allosteric, while clade 8, which is predominantly bacterial, is
unlikely to be nonallosteric as it displays striking divergence in
motif residues (Figures 8 and 9). Specifically, phyla in clade 8 show
no conservation of the amino acids corresponding to the motif residues
A108, A141, A142, and N290. Notably, some bacterial sequences (Cyanobacteria, Lentisphaerae, and Verrucomicrobia) fall in a different clade (clade 6) and
are more similar to eukaryotic UGDHs (49–60% similarity to
sequences in clades 1–3) than they are to other bacterial sequences
(23–37% sequence similarity to sequences in clade 8). Interestingly,
clade 6 bacterial sequences also share some of the allosteric motif
residues (A108, A142, N290) suggesting an ancient origin for the proposed
allosteric mechanism. We also note the diversity of protist UGDH sequences
as they also fall into distinct clades in the phylogenetic tree. For
example, Capsaspora, a protist most closely related to animals, clusters
with UGDH sequences in clades 1 and 2 and conserves nearly all of
the allosteric motif residues, whereas other ciliated protozoa such
as Intermacronucleata lack the allosteric motif residues and group
with bacterial sequences in clade 8. It is also interesting that some
protists such as Parabasalia group with bacterial sequences in clade
6 and share some of the allosteric motif residues (A108, N290). Grouping
of protists and bacteria in gene dendrograms has previously been observed
in other gene families and is often attributed to lateral gene transfer
between protists and bacterial.26 Although
we have focused our analysis on the allosteric motif residues, it
is likely that variations beyond the allosteric motifs contribute
to the placement of protist and bacterial sequences in different clades.
These variations, along with those in the remaining clades (clades
4–7), will require additional analysis to fully map the allosteric
diversity of the UGDH superfamily. In particular, we are intrigued
by the selective conservation of threonine at position 141 in clades
4–7 (Figures 9). If that substitution prevents the formation of the EΩ complex, then it may be that we have identified a key step in the
evolution of atypical allostery in UGDH. Future work will focus on
mapping these evolutionary steps through the experimental characterization
of UGDHs from the Stramenopiles, Bacillariophyta, and Phaeophyceae
phyla in clade 5. Because these sequences contain the Thr141 substitution
and conserve most of the packing defect residues, they appear to be
important transition points between nonallosteric bacterial UGDH and
allosteric human UGDH.

Materials and Methods
Protein Expression and
Purification
The enzymes cUGDH
(UniProt ID: Q19905-1) and hUGDH (UniProt ID: O60701-1) were recombinantly
expressed in Escherichia coli and purified,
as previously described.13−20 Briefly, cUGDH was cloned into modified pET-15b vectors (Norclone)
with N-terminal hexahistidine affinity tags adjacent to a tobacco
etch virus (TEV) cleavage site. Recombinant proteins were purified
using a Talon-immobilized metal affinity column, and the affinity
tags were removed with 5 μM TEV protease for ∼16 h at
20 °C. Proteins were dialyzed into a storage buffer (25 mM TRIS
pH 8.0 and 50 mM NaCl) and then concentrated to 20 mg mL–1 using an Ultra-15 10k centrifugal filter. Proteins were quantified
from dilution replicates (N ≥ 6) using the
molar extinction coefficients of 53 806 and 49 850 M–1 cm–1 for cUGDH and hUGDH, respectively
(calculated with the program PROTPARAM). Proteins were aliquoted and
flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at −80 °C.

Protein Crystallization and Structure Determination
The
cUGDH protein with bound UDP-Xyl was crystallized at 20 °C
using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method, with a 2 μL drop
that consisted of a 1:1 mixture of protein (10 mg mL–1) and reservoir solution. Optimized crystals were obtained using
a reservoir solution that consisted of citric acid buffer pH 5.0,
200 mM LiCl, 1 mM UDP-Xyl, and 4% PEG 8000. These crystals were soaked
in a cryoprotectant mixture composed of the same reservoir solution
supplemented with 15% v/v of the cryoprotectant solution (1:1:1 ethylene
glycol/dimethyl sulfoxide/glycerol ratio) and then rapidly plunged
into liquid nitrogen.

Diffraction data were collected on the
22-ID beamline (SER-CAT) at Argonne National Laboratory (Argonne,
IL) using a MAR 300 mm CCD detector. The 2.45 Å data set was
processed with XDS in the space group P22121, setting aside 5% of the data for cross-validation.27,28 The structure was solved by molecular replacement using PHENIX and
a single dimer of the unliganded cUGDH crystal structure (PDB: 2O3J; unpublished) as
a search model. During refinement, the structure was subjected to
iterative cycles of manual model rebuilding using COOT and the automated
refinement procedure that is implemented within the PHENIX software
suite.29−31 The Rfree test set was
corrupted during refinement, so a posterior R-free was calculated
by selecting 7% of the reflections for a new cross-validation data
set and subjecting the final model to Cartesian dynamics at 4000°
to decouple the test set. Data collection and refinement statistics
can be found in Table 3.

Structural Analyses
The sequence alignment for cUGDH,
hUGDH, and spUGDH was generated using Sequoia.34 The ligand interactions in the cUGDH/UDP-xylose structure
were determined using LigPlot.35 The program
DynDom36,37 was used to identify the hinge-bending axes
for the domain rotation between the open and closed states and the
rigid body rotation axis that relates the 32 symmetry hexamer to the
horseshoe-shaped conformation. PISA38 and
DIMPLOT35 were used to identify interacting
residues at the hexamer-building interfaces in the cUGDH and hUGDH
structures. The α6-helix rotation angle was calculated using
PyMOL (https://pymolwiki.org/index.php/AngleBetweenHelices). Briefly,
the monomers from the unliganded and UDP-Xyl bound structures were
superimposed via least-squares-refinement using the Cα residues
1-132, and the rotation of the α6-helix was measured by using
the Cα residues 141-151. Both PyMOL39 and UCSF Chimera 1.1340 were used to
generate figures.

Sedimentation Velocity
Sedimentation
velocity experiments
were conducted, as previously described.13−15,17−20 Briefly, 9 μM cUGDH was dialyzed >12 h at
4
°C into a buffer with or without 80 μM of UDP-Xyl containing
25 mM HEPES pH 7.5 and 150 mM KCl. Samples were loaded into 12 mm
double-sector Epon centerpieces equipped with quartz window cells.
Cells were then loaded into an An60 Ti rotor and equilibrated to 20
°C for 1.5 h. Sedimentation velocity data were collected using
an Optima XLA analytical ultracentrifuge at 50 000 rpm for
8–10 h. Absorbance data were recorded at 280 nm in radial step
sizes of 0.003 cm. SEDNTERP was used to estimate the partial specific
volume of cUGDH (0.73895 mL g–1) and the buffer
density (1.00726 g mL–1) and viscosity (0.01018
P).41 Data were modeled as a continuous
sedimentation coefficient (c(s))
distribution using SEDFIT.42 The baseline,
meniscus, frictional coefficient, and systematic time-invariant, and
radial invariant noise were fit.21 Theoretical s-values were calculated using HYDROPRO43 and the available crystal structures (PDB: 2O3J and 6OM8).

Steady-State
and Transient-State Kinetics
All steady-state
kinetic assays were performed, as previously described.13−20 Briefly, assays contained 100 nM enzyme and either saturating amounts
of UDP-Glc or NAD+ in the reaction buffer (50 mM HEPES
pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, and 5 mM EDTA). Solutions containing enzyme and
substrate/cofactor were incubated separately at 25 °C for 5 min,
and then the reaction was initiated by rapidly mixing the two solutions.
The progress of the reaction monitored NADH production (ε340 nm = 6220 M–1cm–1) on an Agilent 8453 UV/vis spectrometer at 25 °C, with absorbance
readings collected every 0.5 s. Because the progress curves for both
cUGDH and hUGDH display hysteresis, the initial velocity (vi) represents a transient that violates the
steady-state approximation.13,15,16,18 Thus, the initial steady-state
velocities (vss) were derived from fitting
progress curves to Frieden’s equation for hysteresis before
the depletion of 10% substrate13−15,18,23 1  where P is the product produced
at time t and τ is the relaxation time of the
lag. The length of the lag is equal to eτ. All data were fit
using the nonlinear regression analysis in PRISM (GraphPad Software).
UDP-Glucose substrate saturation curves were fit to eq 2 2  where vo is the
initial steady-state velocity (vss in eq 1), [Et] is the
enzyme concentration (100 nM), and [S] is the variable substrate concentration.
Both enzymes display negative cooperativity in NAD+ saturation
curves and were fit to the sigmoidal rate eq 3 3  where K0.5 is
the half saturation point and h is the Hill coefficient.
The affinity (Ki) for UDP-Xyl was determined
by globally fitting substrate saturation curves with and without inhibitor
to a competitive inhibition model with cooperativity (eq 4) using PRISM13−15,18 4  The hysteresis (lag in the activity)
in progress
curves was measured at 25 °C using an Applied Photophysics SX20
stopped-flow spectrophotometer, as previously described. Briefly,
500 nM cUGDH or hUGDH in the reaction buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5,
50 mM NaCl, and 5 mM EDTA) was rapidly mixed with an equal volume
of the same buffer supplemented with saturating amounts of both the
substrate and cofactor. Progress curves were monitored by NADH production
(ε340 = 6220 M–1 cm–1) and fit to eq 1.

Phylogenetic Analysis
Human UGDH orthologs were identified
by running BLAST on the NCBI nonredundant database, resulting in nearly
70 000 related sequences. Only a subset of 31 sequences that
best represented the overall taxonomic diversity of UGDH from bacteria
to humans was chosen for phylogenetic analysis, as current methods
are incapable of handling larger sequence datasets. Sequences were
selected to maximize phylogenetic diversity while keeping the number
of sequences to a minimum. Specifically, the highest scoring homolog
from each taxonomic group was selected for analysis while fragmentary
sequences or those with large insertions and/or deletions were removed
to minimize alignment errors. The selected sequences were aligned
using the MAPGAPS scheme. The alignment and taxonomic information
for the 31 sequences is provided in the (Supporing Information Table 1 and Sequence File). The aligned sequences
were used for phylogenetic tree generation using IQTree v1.6.1 with
the following options: -m MFP -bb 10 000.44 Bootstrap support values were calculated using UltraFast
bootstrap approximation (UFBoot) implemented in IQTree. Independent
trees generated using FastTree showed topologies similar to IQTree.45
