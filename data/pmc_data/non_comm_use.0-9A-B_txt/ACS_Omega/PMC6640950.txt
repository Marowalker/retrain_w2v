Nickel
oxide nanoparticles of diameter ∼21 nm were prepared
by a sol–gel method using the triblock copolymer poly(ethylene
glycol)-b-(propylene glycol)-b-(ethylene
glycol). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis showed the presence
of Ni2+ and Ni3+ ions in the material. The electrical
conductivity of this material was due to small polaron hopping between
Ni2+ and Ni3+ sites. The magnetization shown
by these nanoparticles was much higher than that reported in the literature.
This is ascribed to the presence of Ni3+ ions with uncompensated
spin moments. Spin-glass behavior was exhibited by the material at
10.7 K. The electrochemical characterization of electrodes comprising
of these NiO nanoparticles using cyclic voltammetric measurements
showed a specific capacitance value of 810 F/g, the highest reported
for this material. These materials will thus form one of the useful
multifunctional systems.

1 Introduction
Nanoparticles of nickel
oxide have attracted the attention of the
scientific community in recent years because of their properties that
have been found to be suitable for applications such as catalysis,
battery cathodes, gas sensors, electrochromic films, and chemical
sensors.1−16 Several interesting basic studies have been reported to understand
the mechanisms involved in the appearance of ferromagnetic (FM)-like
behavior in antiferromagnetic (AFM) nanoparticles such as those of
NiO. Using extended X-ray absorption fine structure technique, it
was shown that magnetization in this system arose due to the presence
of vacancies over the particle volume, which was described within
a core–shell model. By extending the concept of vacancy-induced
magnetism of nonmagnetic materials to an AFM system such as NiO, exchange
bias property could be explained.17 The
magnetic properties of NiO nanoparticles of different particle sizes
showed that the blocking temperature increased as a function of diameter
whereas the magnetic anisotropy decreased with an increase in the
particle size. The uncompensated spins on the nanoparticle surfaces
were found to be randomly distributed.18 For NiO nanoparticles with diameters less than ∼12 nm, saturation
and remanent magnetization and coercivity increased as the particle
size was reduced.19 NiO nanoparticles synthesized
using a simple thermal decomposition route exhibited FM properties
including spin-glass behavior. The significance of surface states
at the FM particle shell was brought out in such studies.20 NiO nanoparticles prepared using the ball-milling
process showed FM behavior. High-temperature measurements exhibited
a magnetic phase transition at around 780 K, which was due to the
induced FM phase.21 A significant development
has been the work related to the use of NiO as electrochemical capacitor
electrodes as a replacement for RuO2 whose high cost limits
its wide applications.22−30 Various preparation techniques have been reported for making NiO
to study its electrochemical capacitance performance. The examples
are NiO with an ordered mesoporous structure using mesoporous silica
as a template31 or using a supramolecular
templating mechanism;32 NiO/Ni(OH)2 nanoplatelets;33 mesoporous NiO
with various hierarchical nanostructures;34 NiO nanoparticles using carbon black powder;35 capsule-like NiO nanoparticles;36 and porous hollow spheres of NiO nanosheets.37 A pluronic triblock copolymer has been used earlier to
prepare nanocrystalline MgO with a large surface area.38 Similar studies have been reported in the synthesis
of ZnO nanostructures.39 We have explored
the synthesis of NiO nanoparticles using a triblock copolymer. These
materials exhibited a FM behavior with high values of magnetization
and showed excellent electrochemical characteristics as electrodes
of supercapacitors. These properties were attributed due to the presence
of both Ni2+ and Ni3+ ions on the surfaces of
NiO nanoparticles synthesized using P123 triblock copolymer. The details
are reported in this paper.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Synthesis
The precursors used were
poly(ethylene oxide)-b-(propylene oxide)-b-(ethylene oxide) triblock copolymer P123, ethanol, and
nickel acetate. A solution was prepared by dissolving 1 g of P123
in 12.67 mL of ethanol and 2.5 g of nickel acetate. After stirring it
for 10 min by adding 0.6 g of 0.5 N HCl, 1–2 g of (C2H5)3PO was added, and the resultant mixture
was stirred in a sealed bottle for 20 h. The sol was gelled in a Petri
dish at 300 K in air for 5 days and subsequently dried at 353 K for
7 days in an oven. The sample was then heat-treated at 673 K for 6
h. The triblock copolymer template produced nucleation sites for NiO
particles, which then grew during the subsequent heat treatment, and
the organic entities were removed. The NiO nanoparticles with nanopores
within them helped create the point defect Ni3+ on the
surfaces of the particles. Powders obtained after crushing the product
were used for characterization purposes (Figure 1).

2.2 Characterization
An X-ray diffraction
pattern of the powders synthesized was recorded on a Bruker D8 XRD
SWAX diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation. The microstructure
was studied using a JEOL 2010 high-resolution transmission electron
microscope. X-ray photoelectron spectra were recorded using a spectrometer
supplied by Omicron NanoTechnology with the serial no. 0571 using
the Al Kα radiation source under 15 kV voltage and 5 mA current.
Electrical resistivity measurements were taken on pellets made by
compacting NiO powders prepared as described above by applying a load
of 5 ton. Silver paint electrodes (supplied by Acheson Colloiden B.V.,
The Netherlands) were applied on both faces of the pellets. A Keithley-617
electrometer was used to study the resistivity variation as a function
of temperature. Magnetization measurements in the temperature range
2–300 K were recorded using a magnetic property measurement
system superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer (Quantum
Design USA).

Electrochemical characterization was carried out
using a three-electrode system. The working electrode was prepared
by mixing 70% of active materials (in this case, NiO powder), 20%
of acetylene black as conductive fillers, and 10% of polytetrafluoroethylene
as a binder. The mixture was pasted on nickel foam (1 × 1 cm),
which served as the current collector. The nickel
foam was dried in an oven for 12 h at 353 K and then pressed to fabricate
electrodes. A platinum wire was used as the counter electrode, and
Ag/AgCl was used as the reference electrode. All measurements were
recorded using 6 M KOH as the electrolyte. Cyclic voltammetric (CV)
measurements were recorded on the above-mentioned system using a Neware
BTS battery tester within a range of −0.2 to +0.3 V at the
scan rates of 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 70 mV/s.

3 Results and Discussion
Figure 2 gives the
X-ray diffraction pattern obtained from the NiO nanoparticles prepared
in this work. The diffraction peaks have been indexed to the NiO lattice
planes, as given in JCPDS no. 04-0835. Using the Debye–Scherrer
equation,40 the crystallite size was estimated
to be 20.9 nm. Figure 3a shows a transmission electron micrograph of the NiO particles.
The average diameter of the particles is seen to be 21 nm, which is
in satisfactory agreement with that estimated from the X-ray line-broadening
analysis. A high-resolution transmission electron micrograph with
clear evidence of lattice fringes for the planes (111) is shown in Figure 3b.

Figure 4a,b
gives
the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of NiO. From Figure 4a, it can be seen
that the asymmetric Gaussian peak confirms the presence of multiple
oxygen valence states in the sample. The corresponding binding energies
were extracted by fitting the curve with three symmetrical peaks having
three binding energies. The low-binding-energy component (BEl centered at 530.1 eV) corresponds to the oxygen-binding energy;
the high-binding-energy component (BEh centered at 532.8
eV) corresponds to oxygen absorption; and the mid-binding-energy component
(BEm centered at 531.7 eV) corresponds to oxygen vacancy.41−43Figure 4b was fitted
with two symmetrical peaks to estimate the relative contents of Ni2+ and Ni3+ species, respectively.44 By taking the ratio of the areas under these two Gaussian
curves, we estimated the relative concentrations of Ni2+ and Ni3+ as 56 and 44%, respectively. The presence of
Ni3+ is believed to be due to the large surface area including
nanopores within the NiO nanoparticles as pointed out earlier. The
surfaces possess high energy content and thereby can sustain the generation
of defects such as Ni3+.

nanoparticles. (b) XPS
spectrum of Ni obtained from NiO nanoparticles.

Figure 5 shows
the
variation in log resistivity (ρ) as a function of inverse temperature
(T) of a pellet of NiO nanoparticles. The Ni2+ and Ni3+ sites give rise to a small polaron hopping
mechanism of electrical conduction. According to this model, the DC
resistivity ρ is given by45,46 1  where k is the Boltzmann
constant, T is the temperature, R is the average site separation, ν0 is the optical
phonon frequency, e is the electronic charge, α
is the spatial decay parameter for the electronic wave function, which
describes the localized state at each Ni site, C is
the ratio of Ni2+/(total Ni ion concentration), and W is the activation energy. From the slope of the straight
line representing the linear plot in Figure 5, the activation energy W was found to be 0.23 eV. The resistivity data were fitted to eq 1, taking R, α, and ν0 as fitting parameters. The extracted
values of the latter are summarized in Table 1.

a R, α, and
ν0 were taken as the fitting parameters.

The values are reasonable. R matches the intersite
separation between Ni ions as calculated from the lattice constant
of a NiO (rocksalt) structure.19 The electron
localization parameter α and ν0 are also consistent
with the theoretical model.18

Figure 6a gives
the variation in magnetization as a function of temperature in the
range 2–300 K for a zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and a field-cooled
(FC) sample by applying a field of 50 Oe. Here, the bifurcation temperature
(above which all spins are unblocked and usually marks the highest
blocking temperature of the ensemble) is above 300 K, and TB (a peak below the bifurcation temperature)
cannot be measured exactly as the peak is very broad (169.5 K). At
low temperatures, there is a sharp peak, which is designated by TF, at 10.1 K. The small peak is
due to the spin-glass behavior. For this, we have taken the AC magnetization
measurement as a function of frequency in the temperature range 5–50
K. The experimental results are shown in Figure 6b, where variation in the real part of susceptibility
is shown as a function of frequency. It can be seen that the curve
shows a maximum, which shifted to higher temperature as the frequency
is increased.

in
the range 2–300 K for a ZFC and a FC condition. (b) Frequency
dependence of the real part of the magnetization as measured at 3
T with the AC frequency.

It can be seen from Figure 6b that the curve shows a maximum, which shifted to
higher
temperatures as the frequency is increased. Three models are used
to analyze the results. The Neel–Arrhenius law should be applicable
in the case of superparamagnetic systems for which the relaxation
time τ is given by49 2  where Ea is the
isotropy energy barrier, kB is the Boltzmann
constant, Tp is the peak temperature,
and τ0 depends on the gyromagnetic precession time.
Usually for superparamagnets, τ0 lies in the range
of 10–10 to 10–13 s.49 However, in the present system, τ0 is extracted to be on the order of 10–26. This is unphysical; hence, the possibility of the presence of superparamagnets
can be ruled out.

For a spin-glass system, the Vogel–Fulcher
law49 should be applicable. For this, the
value of
τ is given by 3  The experimental data were fitted satisfactorily
to eq 3 as shown in Figure 7a. The large value
of τ0 ≈ 10–8 to 10–9 s is expected from interacting magnetic spin clusters. The Vogel–Fulcher
law is the modification of the Neel–Arrhenius law. As mentioned
earlier, the Vogel–Fulcher law is used for both cluster-spin
glasses and spin glasses. The power law assumes the existence of true
equilibrium phase transition. According to the power law 4  Tg is the freezing
temperature, zν is a critical exponent, and
τ0 ≈ 10–10 to 10–13 is for the spin-glass system. The fitting of data to eq 4 is shown in Figure 7b.

Figure 7 (a) Experimental variation in τ with peak
temperature (TP) and its fit with the
Vogel–Fulcher
law. (b) Experimental variation in τ with peak temperature (TP) and its fit with power law.

It has been shown that 5 ≤ zν ≤
11 for the spin-glass system and 1.2 ≤ zν
≤ 2 for regular ferromagnets.49

The values obtained for the different parameters using different
models mentioned above are summarized in Table 2.

in Magnetization as a Function of Temperature

As stated
earlier from the Neel–Arrhenius law, the value
of τ0 obtained is unphysical, so the observed susceptibility
variation is not caused by noninteracting superparamagnets. τ0 obtained from the Vogel–Fulcher law indicates the
presence of conventional spin glass. The value of τ0 obtained from power law is about 4 orders of magnitude smaller
than that extracted from the Vogel–Fulcher law. The difference
between T0 and Tg is very small, ∼1.1 K.

Also, the initial frequency
shift of Tp from the frequency dependence
of the peak temperature was calculated
using 5  where δTp is the relative change in the freezing temperature and ΔTp is the total change in Tp in the frequency interval, Δ log10ω. In the present system,
δTp = 0.04. For canonical spin glasses,
it lies between 0.0045 and 0.06, and for superparamagnets, it is larger
than 0.1.47 Thus, the studies on AC magnetization
and magnetic relaxation confirmed the presence of spin-glass-like
behavior in our system. The sample exhibited spin-glass behavior at
low temperatures, with the freezing point at 10.7 K.

Figure 8a shows
the magnetization–magnetic-field hysteresis curves obtained
for the NiO nanoparticles at different temperatures under both FC
and ZFC conditions. The magnetization obtained is much higher than
that reported earlier in the case of NiO nanoparticles.47,48 Magnified views of M–H curves
for low values of H are shown in Figure 8b. For FC M–H measurements, the sample that was cooled down
to respective temperatures under 3 T magnetic fields exhibited an
exchange bias effect, indicating the presence of unidirectional anisotropy.

Figure 8 (a) M–H hysteresis curves
for NiO nanoparticles at different temperatures. (b) Magnified view
of M–H curves for low values
of H.

Such an effect has been explained to arise because of the
magnetic
interaction at the interface between a FM and an AFM phase.37,49 At lower temperatures, exchange interaction is maximum, but at higher
temperatures, the magnetic moments both in core and in shell are free
to reverse with applied magnetic field, and thus, there is no shift
in the hysteresis loop. In the present system of NiO nanoparticles
synthesized using the P123 triblock copolymer, the exchange bias effect
was much larger than those reported earlier.37,48 We ascribe such high values of magnetization observed to the presence
of Ni3+ ions, which contribute to uncompensated magnetic
spins in the otherwise AFM NiO system. This in addition to the oxygen
vacancies at the nanoparticle surfaces gives rise to a high value
of magnetization in the system.

3.1 CV Measurements
The specific capacitance
was calculated using the following formula37 6  where C is the specific capacitance, m is the
mass of NiO powder, v is the scan
rate (V/s), and I(V) is the anodic
or cathodic current.

The specific capacitance of this material
was calculated to be 810, 572, 522, 402, 337, 328, and 280 F/g at
scan rates 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 70 mV/s, respectively, as shown
in Figure 9. The specific
capacitance was a maximum at lowest scan rates and decreased with
increasing scan rates. The specific capacitance of this material was
much higher than that reported earlier for NiO.32,37

Figure 9 CV
curves of NiO nanoparticles at various scan rates.

In the case of electrical double-layer capacitance,
the shape of
the CV curve is normally close to that of a rectangle.36,37 However, the present result implies that the redox mechanism is
mainly associated with a distinct pair of redox peaks during anodic
and cathodic sweeps. The redox peaks were observed within the potential
range 0.15–0.35 V. The anodic and cathodic peaks arose due
to the oxidation of NiO to NiOOH (charging) and due to the reduction
of NiOOH to NiO (discharging), respectively. The process follows the
following redox reaction36,37  The electrochemical
irreversibility exists
due to the unsymmetrical cathodic and anodic sweeps.

Nowadays,
transition metal oxides are promising materials that
are used in electrochemical applications. Hydrous ruthenium oxide
has exhibited a high specific capacitance value (720 F/g),30 but its high cost and toxicity remain as the
problem. Therefore, it can be substituted by transition metal elements,
which are cheaper and nontoxic. So far, a variety of NiO nanostructures
such as nanoparticles, nanotubes, nanoflakes, and nanowhiskers were
used as electrodes, and the maximum specific capacitance was found
to be 580 F/g at a scan rate of 5 mV/s.33 The other reported capacitance of the electrodes made of nanostructured
NiO materials had values in the range of 128–556 F/g.32,37 Our material gave the highest specific capacitance (810 F/g at 5
mV/s scan rate). It is believed that such an increase in capacitance
is due to the enhancement of Ni2+ to Ni3+ redox
reaction28,33,36 because of
the presence of Ni3+ ions in our material as a result of
the synthesis method adopted in this investigation. These results
show that the NiO nanostructure prepared in the present work can be
considered to be a promising candidate for the supercapacitor applications
as it exhibits excellent electrode material characteristics.

4 Conclusions
Nickel oxide nanoparticles of diameter
∼21 nm were synthesized
by a sol–gel method using the triblock copolymer poly(ethylene
glycol)–poly(propylene glycol)–poly(ethylene glycol).
XPS analysis confirmed the presence of Ni2+ and Ni3+ ions in the material. The electrical conductivity of the
material was found to be due to small polaron hopping between Ni2+ and Ni3+ sites. The magnetization exhibited by
these nanoparticles was much higher than those reported in the literature
for this system. This is ascribed to the presence of Ni3+ ions with uncompensated spin moments. Spin-glass behavior was shown
by the particles at 10.7 K. Electrochemical characterization of electrodes
comprising of these NiO nanoparticles using CV measurements gave a
specific capacitance value of 810 F/g, the highest reported so far.
These materials will form one of the useful multifunctional systems.
