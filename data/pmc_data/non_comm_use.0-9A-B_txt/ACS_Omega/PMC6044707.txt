Alterations in protein (e.g., biomarkers)
expression levels have
a significant correlation with tumor development and prognosis; therefore,
it is desired to develop precise methods to differentiate the expression
level of proteins in tumor cell lines, especially at the single-cell
level. Here, we report a precise and versatile approach of quantifying
the protein expression levels of three tumor cell lines in situ using
a peptide–Au cluster probe. The probe (Au5Peptide3) consists of a peptide with a specific cell membrane epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeting ability and an Au cluster
for both cell membrane EGFR imaging using confocal microscopy and
cell membrane EGFR counting by laser ablation inductively coupled
plasma mass spectrometry. Utilizing the peptide–Au cluster
probe, we successfully quantify the EGFR expression levels of SMMC-7721,
KB, and HeLa cells at a single-cell level and differentiate the EGFR
expression levels among these cell lines. The peptide–Au cluster
probe, with the ability to differentiate the protein expression level
of different cell lines, shows exceptional promise for providing reliable
predictive and prognostic information of tumors at a single-cell level.

Introduction
Characterizing the
protein quantity of
a single cell can provide valuable insight into the molecular mechanisms
of cellular processes, including the cellular heterogeneous response
to different chemical drugs and physical stimuli.1,2 In
clinical settings, information on a specific protein quantity of a
single cell can help assess disease progression and prognosis.3,4 The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an important cell-surface
receptor for the maintenance of cell proliferation, differentiation,
and survival.5 EGFR is overexpressed in many cancers, including head and
neck, colon, and breast cancers.6−8 In several cancers, such as gastric
and colon cancers, EGFR expression is associated with a poor prognosis
undergoing a potentially curative surgery.8,9 Nowadays,
EGFR levels are mostly quantified using enzyme immunoassay, western
blot, and flow cytometric analyses.6,10,11 However, the procedures for these methods are complex.
They need cell lysis and protein extraction and can only provide the
EGFR level on the basis of the average of large-cell populations. As
EGFR is an important biomarker in cancer progression and prognosis,
and different cancer cell lines are heterogeneous in the EGFR expression
level,9 an effective method to differentiate
the EGFR expression levels and precisely quantify the EGFR of different
cell lines at a single-cell level is desired.

Recently,
some single-cell protein analysis methods have emerged. These methods
were based on an antibody conjugated with lanthanide ions, and the
specific protein expression level in the single cell was obtained
by counting lanthanide ions using mass cytometry.12,13 However, antibody-based protein quantification
methods have some shortcomings. For example, it is difficult to precisely
control the number of lanthanide ions conjugated to the antibody,14−16 thus it is hard to determine the precise protein level in a single
cell. In addition, the antibody is expensive. With the advantage of
low immunogenicity, ease in synthesis, and low cost, peptide ligands
have been pursued as a target moiety for certain proteins. In this
article, we developed a new peptide–Au cluster probe to quantify
EGFR in a single cell. Our peptide–Au cluster is relatively
cheap and easily synthesized when compared with an antibody. In addition,
in a single probe there are exactly five gold atoms; thus we can count
more precisely the protein expression level in a single cell.

It is reported that EGFR overexpression is correlated with hepatocellular
carcinoma,17−19 nasopharyngeal carcinoma,20,21 and cervical cancers.22,23 SMMC-7721, KB, and
HeLa cells are the cells associated with the aforementioned hepatocellular
carcinoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and cervical cancer, respectively.
The information on EGFR expression in the three cell lines is important
for cancer diagnosis and therapy. Therefore, these three tumor cell
lines (SMMC-7721, KB, and HeLa cells) were chosen for EGFR studies.
We designed a peptide–Au cluster probe (Au5Peptide3), with a fluorescent property and a specific EGFR-targeting
ability, to realize EGFR visualization in these cell lines by confocal
microscopy. Then, with the help of laser ablation inductively coupled
plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) and the molecular formula of
our probe (Au5Peptide3), we could precisely
quantify EGFR in a single SMMC-7721, KB, and HeLa cell by counting
the Au element of the EGFR-binding peptide–Au cluster.

Results
and Discussion
The peptide H2N–YHWYGYTPQNVIKKKKYCC–COOH,
with two functional domains, was designed. YHWYGYTPQNVI is a specific
target sequence for EGFR.24 KKKKYCC was
added to the carboxyl terminal of the target sequence. KKKK was added
to increase the solubility of the sequence, whereas YCC was added
for capturing the Au cluster. The specific synthetic process is described
in Experimental Procedures.

After obtaining
our probe, we analyzed its absorption, fluorescence,
and mass spectra. Compared to the UV–vis spectra of the free
peptide (Figure 1a,
black line), we found that a new absorption band appears at 330 nm,
in accordance with the maximum excitation at 322 nm (Figure 1b, black line). The probe showed
maximum emission at 414 nm (Figure 1b, red line) and strong blue fluorescence under UV
irradiation of 365 nm (inset of Figure 1b). To quantify EGFR in a single cell accurately, we
needed to acquire the precise composition of our probe. Matrix-assisted
laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS)
is a popular method for studying the accurate mass of a noble metal
cluster.25−27 As shown in Figure 1c,d, the peptide–Au cluster is mainly composed
of fragments of Au5 plus six S atoms. We cannot see the
intact peptide–Au cluster composition (Figure 1c,d), as the C–S bond of the peptide
is easily broken during the desorption process.28,29 The mass spectral data in Figure 1d suggested that the composition of our probe fragment
is Au5S6. As each peptide is with two Cys, for
example, two S atoms, we deduce that the probe formula is Au5Peptide3.

To mark and quantify EGFR precisely,
the specificity of the probe
needed to be confirmed first. Figure S1 in the Supporting Information suggests that our probe can mark SMMC-7721,
KB, and HeLa cells. To confirm the specific EGFR recognition of our
probe, immunofluorescence assays and blocking studies were further
carried out. The blue fluorescence of the probe and the red fluorescence
of the EGFR antibody were well co-localized on the membranes of the
SMMC-7721, KB, and HeLa cells, as depicted in Figure 2a–c, respectively. In the blocking
study, we failed to see any obvious probe fluorescence on the membranes
of the SMMC-7721, KB, and HeLa cells after the EGFR of these cell
lines were first blocked by 5 mM free peptides, because the binding
site of EGFR had been occupied by the free peptides (Figure 2d–f). All of the results
support the EGFR specificity recognition of our probes.

of three cell lines. Confocal fluorescence images of the three cell
lines exposed to (a–c) the Au5Peptide3 probe, followed by the EGFR antibody (mouse monoclonal antibody)
and the goat antimouse IgG-TR, (d–f) 5 mM free
peptide incubated first with the cells for 1 h, followed by the Au5Peptide3 probe incubated for 45 min.

We needed to confirm the optimal labeling parameter
before quantifying
EGFR in the three cell lines. In this study, solution-based ICP-MS
was carried out to obtain the proper probe and cell incubation conditions. Figure 3a–c suggests
that the Au mass per cell was saturated when the probe reached 1.87
μM and after 1 h of incubation time. The time parameter of cell
labeling was then carried out. Figure 3d–f shows that the optimal labeling time was
1 h when the probe concentration was 1.87 μM. All of these results
suggest that the optimal labeling condition to count EGFR in the cells
was 1.87 μM and 1 h.

Figure 3 Average mass of Au per cell was determined by
ICP-MS to optimize
the cell label conditions in three cell lines exposed to (a–c)
a series of concentrations of the peptide–Au cluster probe
in a Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) medium for 1 h and (d–f)
the probe of 1.87 μM (the optimized concentration) for different
time points.

According to Figure 3a–f, under
the optimal labeling conditions, the average Au
mass in SMMC-7721, KB, and HeLa cells was about 11.35 ± 0.81,
33.89 ± 1.61, and 8.45 ± 0.45 fg, respectively.

As
one probe contained 5 Au atoms, the number of probe molecules
in one SMMC-7721, KB, and HeLa cell was about 11.35 ± 0.81, 33.89
± 1.61, and 8.45 ± 0.45 amol, respectively, which is equal
to the amount of EGFR in a single SMMC-7721, KB, and HeLa cell (Figure 4a). We then used
Western blotting to confirm the accuracy of our method to differentiate
EGFR expression levels in the three cell lines. According to Figure 4b, KB cells express
the highest levels of EGFR among the three cell lines, followed by
SMMC-7721 cells and then HeLa cells. The result of the Western blot
analysis suggests the feasibility of our method to differentiate different
EGFR levels in the three cell lines.

SMMC-7721 cells. β-Actin is used as a control to ensure the
accuracy of immunoblotting.

To further check the EGFR expression level in a single cell,
we
used LA-ICP-MS to quantify the abundance of Au (which can be precisely
switched to the EGFR amount by the probe formula) under the optimized
labeling conditions. The operation conditions for LA-ICP-MS is shown
in Table S1. Figure 5a–f shows the transient Au signals
of the three cell lines determined by LA-ICP-MS without probe treatment
(a–c) and under the optimized probe labeling conditions (d–f).
To obtain the relationship between the Au signal intensity and the
Au concentration in a single cell, we used MicroFabJetLab (a commercial
inkjet printer) as our calibration standard.30,31 The 197Au signal intensity from ablation of different
contents of Au standards on glass slides and the corresponding calibration
curve are shown in Figure S2. According
to the Au standard calibration curve and three kinds of control cells
(Figure 5a–c),
we can regard the Au signal intensities under the optimized incubation
conditions (Figure 5d–f) as a response to our probe (note that we first integrated
the peak areas and then compared it to that of the calibration curve).

Figure 5 Transient
Au signals of the three cell lines determined by LA-ICP-MS
(a–c) without any probe treatment and (d–f) under the
optimal probe incubation conditions.

Under the optimal incubation condition, the mass of Au in
a single
cell ranged from 5.75 to 20.45 fg for SMMC-7721 cells, 16.95 to 44.69
fg for KB cells, and 1.88 to 15.19 fg for HeLa cells (see details
in Figures 5d–f
and S2). As one probe contains 5 Au atoms,
the amount of probe (equal to the number of EGFR) of 35 cells on a
single cell was from 5.75 to 20.5 amol for SMMC-7721 cells, 17 to
44.7 amol for KB cells, and 1.88 to 15.2 amol for HeLa cells. The
average EGFR amount in Figure 5d–f was 13 ± 3.8 amol for SMMC-7721 cells, 34
± 7.7 amol for KB cells, and 7.3 ± 3.6 amol for HeLa cells.
These results were close to the result of 11.35 ± 0.81 amol for
SMMC-7721 cells, 33.89 ± 1.61 amol for KB cells, and 8.45 ±
0.45 amol for HeLa cells per cell determined from the bulk cell digestion
method in Figure 4a.

Conclusions
In conclusion, utilizing the probe, we successfully quantified
three cell lines with different EGFR expression levels in a single
cell. The trend of the average EGFR expression levels in the three
cell lines obtained from LA-ICP-MS is in accordance with the commonly
used protein quantification method, Western blot, which suggests the
reliability of our probe to differentiate cells with different protein
expression levels. The
broad spectrum activity of our probe to quantify proteins in different
cell lines makes it possible to differentiate a specific protein of
multiple tumor cell lines. As the variation of a protein quantity
at a single-cell level has a significant correlation with the early
progression of a tumor cell, our methods can help estimate the earlier
tumor development at a single-cell level.

3 kDa) were purchased from Merck. Paraformaldehyde was purchased from
Sigma. The KB cell line was purchased from Cancer Institute and Hospital,
Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. The SMMC-7721 cell line was a

Preparation
of the Peptide–Au Cluster Probe
The peptide solution
(1 mM, 515 μL) was prepared by dissolving
it in ultrapure water. NaOH was used to adjust the pH to 10. (The
whole preparation process was carried out at 42 °C.) After stirring
for 5 min, HAuCl4 (25 mM, 10 μL) aqueous solution
was introduced under vigorous stirring. Subsequently, the pH of the
solution was adjusted to 14 by NaOH and incubated for 12 h. Finally,
the probe was stored away from light at 4 °C. Before being used
in the subsequent experiments, the probe was dialyzed at 3 kDa to
remove the free ions and peptides.

Characterization of the Peptide–Au
Cluster Probe: Product Yield of the Peptide–Au Cluster Probe
We used ICP-MS to measure the product yield of the peptide–Au
cluster probe. First, the probe was purified using a dialysis tube
(MWCO: 3 kDa) to remove the free ions and peptides. Then, 1 mL nitric
acid and 3 mL hydrochloric acid were added to the purified and crude
samples overnight. (All of the samples were run in triplicate.) Subsequently,
we used the Microwave Reactions System to digest the samples and diluted
them with an aqueous solution containing 2% HNO3 and 1%
HCl. Then, a series of Au standard solutions (0.5, 1, 5, 10, 50 ng/mL
aqueous solution containing 2% HNO3 and 1% HCl) was injected
into the ICP-MS system to get the standard calibration plot. Finally,
the purified and crude samples were also injected into the ICP-MS
system. The product yield of the peptide–Au cluster probe was
42.15%.

Optical Spectra Study of the Peptide–Au Cluster Probe:
Absorption Spectra Study
The peptide–Au cluster probe
was diluted with Milli-Q water and then used for absorption spectra
study. The reference solution was Milli-Q water. We obtained the spectra
using a spectrophotometer (UV-1800; Shimadzu, Japan).

Fluorescent
Spectra Study
We used a spectrofluorometer
(RF-5301; Shimadzu, Japan) to obtain the fluorescence spectra of our
probe.

MALDI-TOF-MS Study of the Peptide–Au Cluster Probe
The mass spectra were obtained by the ABI MALDI-TOF system in a
linear positive mode with the matrix CHCA.

Specific Study of the Probe
for EGFR in SMMC-7721, KB, and HeLa
Cells: Cell Location Study of the Probe in SMMC-7721, KB, and HeLa
Cells
The SMMC-7721, KB, and HeLa cells were cultured on
a glass-bottomed culture dish and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h.
After being washed with PBS twice and fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde
at room temperature for 20 min, the cells were incubated with the
probe for 45 min. Then, we washed them with PBS twice to remove the
free probes. Finally, the cells were observed under a fluorescence
microscope (Perkin Elmer Spinning Disc confocal microscope with a
Nikon TI-E inverted microscope, 60× oil immersion lens was used),
and pictures were acquired by UltraVIEW VoX software.

Probe and EGFR
Antibody Co-Localization Study in SMMC-7721,
KB, and HeLa Cells
To make sure the probe marked EGFR specifically,
anti-EGFR antibody was used. First, the cells were fixed with 3.7%
paraformaldehyde for 20 min and incubated with the probe for 45 min.
Second, the cells were washed with PBS three times and incubated with
the anti-EGFR antibody (sc-365829) in PBS for 45 min and, subsequently,
in a second antibody (sc-2781) for 35 min away from light. After that,
we used PBS to wash the cells three times. Finally, the cells were
observed under a confocal microscope.

Blocking Study
To further confirm the specificity of
our probe to EGFR, the cells were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde for
20 min at room temperature and then incubated with 5 mM peptide for
1 h. After washing with PBS three times, the cells were incubated
with the probe at room temperature for 45 min. Finally, the cells
were observed under a confocal microscope.

Quantifying the Expression
Level of EGFR in SMMC-7721, KB, and
HeLa Cells
To get the optimal labeling condition, we first
allowed a series of probe concentrations (0.28, 0.56, 1.12, 1.87,
2.8, 5.6 μM) to be incubated with SMMC-7721, KB, and HeLa cells
for 1 h at room temperature. We then used PBST (a strong wash solution)
to wash our samples 5 times and then counted using flow cytometry.
Subsequently, these samples were transferred to MARS Vessels. In all
of the vessels, 3 mL of nitric acid and 1 mL of hydrogen peroxide
were added individually. After 24 h, these samples were digested against
the Microwave Reactions System (CEM Co. MARS Xpress). After that,
1 mL of nitric acid and 3 mL of hydrochloric acid were added. The
samples were then digested again using the Microwave Reactions System
after 24 h. Ultimately, an aqueous solution containing 2% HNO3 and 1% HCl was added to 3 mL as the final volume. Then, we
got the Au standard Calibration plot by injecting a series of Au standard
solutions (0.5, 1, 5, 10, 50 ng/mL in an aqueous solution containing
2% HNO3 and 1% HCl). All of the samples were run in triplicate.
We then studied the time impact on the labeling efficiency. SMMC-7721,
KB, and HeLa cells were incubated with 1.87 μM of the probe
at different times (10, 20, 40, 60, 70, 90 min) at room temperature.
The other operation steps were the same as the ones in the study of
the concentration effect on the labeling efficiency.

Semiquantitative
Study of the EGFR Expression Levels in SMMC-7721,
KB, and HeLa Cells by Western Blot
SMMC-7721, KB, and HeLa
cells were seeded into a 6-well plate. After 24 h, the cells were
lysed with
200 μL RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl,
1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate
(SDS), 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 50 mM NaF, and 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid) and a protease inhibitor cocktail tablet (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)
for 10 min at 4 °C. Then, we collected the cell supernatant by
centrifugation at 12 000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The protein
concentrations of the four samples were measured by the BCA assay
kit (Beyotime). The samples were then mixed with 4× loading buffer,
heated at 100 °C for 5 min, and subjected to 12% SDS–polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (the proteins loaded across the lanes were equal).
Finally, the proteins were transferred to the PVDF membrane and probed
with specific antibodies, and protein bands were detected using the
Amersham ECLTM Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent (GE healthcare,
U.K.).

Quantification of EGFR in Individual SMMC-7721, KB, and HeLa
Cells by LA-ICP-MS
In the experiment, a 213 laser ablation
system (ESI, Fremont) coupled to a NexION 300D ICPMS instrument (PerkinElmer,
Norwalk) was used. We used helium (the flow rate was 0.8 L/min) as
the ablation gas. Argon was introduced through a Y-piece after the
cell was ablated. During the ablation of the NIST 611 glass, the system
was tuned for a maximum 115In signal intensity, and the
UO/U ratio was kept at a low level simultaneously. The operational
parameters of LA-ICP-MS are given in Table S1. The STD mode was used, and the signal intensity (counts/s) was
collected. In the experiment, SMMC-7721, KB, and HeLa cells were seeded
into a 12-well cell culture cluster. After 12 h, 1.87 μM of
the probe was incubated with the three types of cells for 1 h. Then,
PBST was used to wash the cells 5 times. After the cells were dried,
we introduced them into LA-ICP-MS. A 40 μm diameter area was
chosen to ensure the cell was completely covered. The Au standards
(2.54, 14.86, 28.93, and 133.03 fg) were analyzed individually with
the same experimental procedures in the sample analysis.
