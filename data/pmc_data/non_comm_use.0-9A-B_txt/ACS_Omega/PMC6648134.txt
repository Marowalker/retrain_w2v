To address an important challenge
in the engineering of antioxidant
nanoparticles, the present work devised a surface-to-bulk migration
of oxygen vacancies in the oxygen radical-scavenging cerium-oxide
nanoparticles. The study highlights the significance of surface oxygen
vacancies in the intended cellular internalization and, subsequently,
the radical scavenging activity of the nanoparticles inside the cells.
The findings advise future development of therapeutic antioxidant
nanomaterials to also include engineering of the particles for enhanced
surface defects not only for the accessibility of their oxygen vacancies
but also, equally important, rendering them bioavailable for cellular
uptake.

Introduction
Reactive oxygen species
(ROS) have been implicated in the pathogenesis
of various prominent human diseases, including cancer,1 chronic inflammation,2 neurodegenerative
disorders,3 and even ophthalmologic conditions.4 The clinical effects arise from uncontrolled
generation of metabolic ROS overwhelming the cellular antioxidant
defenses. Overproduction of ROS, including singlet oxygen (O21Δg) species, hydroxyl (•OH) radicals, and superoxide (O2•–) anions, causes destruction of biomolecules such as lipids, proteins,
and DNA, which often leads to irreversible tissue damage.5,6 Over the last decade, the development of nano cerium-oxide (nanoceria)-based
ROS neutralizing therapeutics has received increasing attention because
of the particle’s intrinsic Ce3+/Ce4+ switchable oxidation states. The redox cycling facilitates reversible
stoichiometric storing (CeO2) and release of oxygen (CeO2−δ), rendering nanoceria as a potential self-regenerating
ROS scavenger in response to the presence of both oxidizing and reducing
oxygen species in cells.4,7−9 Research has focused on enhancing the oxygen storage and release
capacity of nanoceria for biological ROS modulation, which is widely
thought to be a function of the formation and mobility of oxygen vacancies.10−12 Structural distortions through elemental doping of nanoceria have
been shown to introduce defects for enhanced oxygen storage and release
capacity via Ce3+/Ce4+ transition of the particles
for antioxidant activity.13−16 However, a solid-state engineering approach for an
intended biological application has the potential to give rise to
unexpected biological fates and functions of nanoparticles.

Underlining the significance of cellular physiological responses
to nanoparticles, herein, we report the biological antioxidant effects
of structurally distorted, oxygen vacancy-engineered nanoceria. ROS-producing
inflammatory cells, in this case, activated U937 monocyte/macrophages
(monocytes are associated with many inflammatory progressions, including
in rheumatoid arthritis), were found to internalize particles most
efficiently when the particles are with high levels of surface oxygen
vacancies, and these particles subsequently scavenged intracellular
ROS. The present work highlights the importance of surface defects
to render the nanoparticle bioavailable for cellular uptake and therefore
enabling the intended activity, in this case, as ROS scavenger, to
take place intracellularly. The study is expected to shift the current
target of engineering of the antioxidant nanoparticle from enhancement
of the oxygen exchange capacity to also include design of distinctive
surface characteristics.

Results and Discussion
To introduce
structural defects, nanoceria was doped with increasing
concentrations of Si4+ and Ta5+ at 10, 30, and
50 at. %, producing Si–CeO2 and Ta–CeO2. The particles were synthesized via rapid flame spray pyrolysis
(FSP) of cerium 2-ethylhexanoate premixed with tetraethyl orthosilicate
and tantalum(V) ethoxide for Si and Ta dopings, respectively. The
FSP technique allows for a one-step, precise stoichiometric synthesis
of the doped nanoceria. The incorporation of Si4+ and Ta5+ with smaller ionic radii of 0.26 and 0.74 Å, respectively,
compared to that of Ce3+ of 1.15 Å or Ce4+ of 0.97 Å17 distorts the crystal
structure of nanoceria (Figure 1).

Figure 1 HR-TEM of FSP-synthesized nanoceria with 10, 30, and 50 at. % Si
and Ta dopings. Yellow lines indicate measurements of lattice spacing.

The presence of dopants transforms
the particle morphology from
the well-defined rhombohedral structure with sharp edges of the nanoceria
[X-ray diffraction (XRD)-estimated average crystal size, dXRD = 11.9 nm, Figure S1 and Table 1] to fully spherical
morphologies with Si doping (dXRD = 10.1–11.6
nm) and into “spheroid” morphologies with Ta doping
(dXRD = 10.8–11.4 nm, with a smaller dXRD = 7.9 nm at 50 at. % doping). Similar findings
have been reported for FSP-synthesized ceria–zirconia with
Si and Al dopings, resulting in changes in the particle morphology
from polyhedral to spherical, even at 3 wt % doping.18 Doping of Si at 30 and 50 at. % resulted in the formation
of an amorphous layer, visible as a gel-like layer surrounding the
particles (Figure 1). Further zeta potential analysis of these particles (Figure 2a) revealed a significant isoelectric
point (IEP) shift from pH ≈ 8 for the nanoceria to pH ≈
4. The IEP of silica (SiO2) is ∼2, and thus the
shift indicated the transformation of the surface properties of 30
and 50 at. % Si–CeO2 toward silica, inferring the
formation of a silica gel-like surface layer.19 XRD analysis, shown in Figure S1, revealed
negligible changes in the diffraction spectra for all Si-doped nanoceria
relative to the nanoceria, consistent with the only small contraction
found from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging (Figure 1). This contraction
is evidence of Si incorporation into the nanoceria lattice (due to
its smaller ionic radius), as later confirmed by X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) depth profiling. For the Ta doping, further mismatch
in ionic valency (Ta5+ compared to Ce3+ and
Ce4+) is also thought to contribute to the structural distortion.20 At 50 at. % Ta doping, the XRD spectrum suggests
the presence of TaO2 phases (Figure S1). All samples exhibit high crystallinity with well-defined
lattice fringes (Figure 1).

Studies of the oxygen vacancies
of the structurally distorted nanoceria
yield interesting insights into the surface and bulk defects as a
result of dopant incorporation. Oxygen vacancies in nanoceria are
formed to compensate for the positive charge reduction to Ce3+ and are theoretically more stable at the surface than in the bulk
crystal.10,21,22 To understand
the nature of oxygen vacancies in the doped nanoceria, O2-temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) studies were carried out
to probe both the oxygen-storage capacity (OSC) of the materials along
with the surface/bulk accessibility of the oxygen vacancies (Figure 2b and Table 1). At low temperature, <200
°C, desorption peaks of the O2-TPD profile are associated
with the release of surface oxygen, whereas higher temperature peaks
correlate with the release of bulk oxygen, requiring more energy.23 The analysis revealed that the Si and Ta dopings
affected the accessibility of the particles’ oxygen vacancies,
despite their generally similar total OSC relative to the nanoceria
(excluding the 50 at. % Si–CeO2 and Ta–CeO2 with 20–30% OSC discrepancies relative to the nanoceria).
The nanoceria particles contained ∼60% surface oxygen vacancies
(of the total OSC) as indicated by the low-temperature desorption
peak, enabling these particles to capture oxygen-free radicals such
as intracellular ROS. A decrease in the surface oxygen vacancy was
observed with 10 at. % Si and Ta dopings as indicated by the reduced
intensity of the low-temperature desorption peaks, representing 40–45%
of their total OSC. Further increasing the Si and Ta dopant loadings
to 30 and 50 at. % caused a dramatic decrease of the surface oxygen
vacancies to ∼5% of their total OSC. The latter was accompanied
by the increased presence of the bulk oxygen vacancies, only accessible
at high temperatures (>200 °C). Note that the decrease in
the
surface oxygen vacancy is in agreement with the reducing % surface
Ce3+ (per unit catalyst) of the particles with increasing
dopant loading (Table S1, oxygen vacancies
are associated with the Ce3+ state). These findings clearly
indicate a concentration-dependent effect of the dopants on the structural
defects that were caused by the incorporation of elements with smaller
ionic radii and/or mismatched ionic valency. In this case, Si4+ and Ta5+ altered the location of the oxygen vacancies
from the surface to the bulk with increasing dopant concentrations.
This migration of oxygen vacancies is also indicated by the H2-temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) profile of the nanoceria
and the doped samples, as shown in Figure S2.

XPS depth profiling was carried out to further understand
the nature
of the surface and bulk oxygen vacancies of the Si- and Ta-doped nanoceria,
with Figure 3 displaying
the O 1s spectra and Figures S3–S5 showing the Si, Ta, and Ce profiles. The nanoceria O 1s spectrum
(Figure 3a) revealed
its surface and bulk oxygen states. At the surface, oxygen predominantly
existed as lattice oxygen (∼526 eV, attributed to the CeO2 state).24 The shoulder at ∼528
eV was likely a contribution of oxygen from Ce2O3, an indication of surface oxygen vacancy,21 that was also supported by the O2-TPD analysis. Depth
profiling revealed the presence of defects in the bulk structure,
as shown by the change in oxygen species in the subsurface layers,
with less lattice oxygen at ∼526 eV accompanied by the presence
of other oxygen species possibly linked to the Ce2O3 form. These non-CeO2 lattice subsurface oxygen
species suggest the presence of oxygen vacancies in the bulk structure.
Incorporation of both Si and Ta dopants resulted in a drastic change
in the O 1s spectra.

Figure 3 XPS O 1s depth profiling of FSP-synthesized (a) neat nanoceria,
(b) 10 and (c) 50 at. % Si–CeO2, and (d) 10 and
(e) 50 at. % Ta–CeO2.

When examining the O 1s spectra for the 10 at. % Si-doped
CeO2, distinct variations in the oxygen species compared
to the
nanoceria were evident. With 10 at. % Si doping, the CeO2 lattice oxygen peak at ∼526 eV became stable throughout the
bulk structure (Figure 3b). This suggests that Si occupied the Ce sites when doped into CeO2, which helped preserve the CeO2 crystal structure,
as indicated by the disappearance of oxygen peaks at ∼528 eV
linked to the Ce2O3 state and hence a decrease
in bulk Ce2O3 defects. The Si occupancy of the
Ce sites was also evidenced by the occurrence of the 529.5 eV peak
in the Si spectra, attributed to SiO2.25 Additionally, its constant presence throughout the bulk
structure indicated successful Si doping into the CeO2 crystal.
The XPS data supported the particle morphologies imaged using TEM
(Figure 1). The TEM
images illustrate the contraction in lattice spacing in the presence
of the Si dopant (from 3.35 to 3.23 Å), consistent with the smaller
crystal lattice of SiO2 relative to CeO2.17 When increased to 50 at. % Si dopant level,
the XPS depth profile showed a dominant presence of SiO2 (529.5 eV) at the surface and a mix of CeO2 (∼526
eV) and SiO2 at increasing depth, with no distinguishable
Ce2O3 peak (∼528 eV) (Figure 3c). This is consistent with
the presence of a SiO2 surface layer visualized under TEM
(Figure 1, as also
confirmed by the lower pH IEP shift shown in Figure 2a), indicating limited surface accessibility
of ceria for oxygen storage and release.

Ta doping resulted
in largely similar particle properties as Si
doping. As shown in Figures 1 and 2a, Ta doping decreased the particle
lattice spacing (from 3.35 to 3.25 Å) and shifted the IEP toward
lower pH. Ta dopant also reduced the oxygen vacancy sites. However,
while Si doping preserved the Ce–O lattice structure, the XPS
depth profile of 10 at. % Ta-doped particles revealed that most of
the Ce–O structure has disappeared (Figure 3d). The ∼526 eV lattice oxygen CeO2 peak significantly diminished, with the emergence of the
∼532 eV peak attributed to TaO2. This suggests the
formation of a cerium/tantalum solid solution, as also indicated by
the XRD spectra (Figure S1). As the Ta
dopant level was increased to 50 at. %, only the TaO2 peak
was visible (Figure S4). The loss of oxygen
adsorption sites, illustrated in the O2-TPD results (Figure 2b), was consistent
with this observation. Overall, both the Si- and Ta-doped ceria showed
surface to bulk migration of the oxygen vacancies with increasing
dopant concentration. This, as described in the following, affected
the cellular responses to the particles and, in turn, their biological
antioxidant activity.

Exposure of activated U937 cells to the
nanoceria or the doped
variants at 50 μg mL–1 for 48 h demonstrated
that none of the particles were cytotoxic even with the increasing
dopant concentration (Figure 4a). All samples exhibited comparable extent of cell proliferation
as that of the medium-only system (without the particles), and this
observation is consistent with our earlier studies for these cells.7−9 The biological antioxidant activities of the particles were investigated
by measuring the reduction of the intracellular ROS level of the macrophages.
Aligned with the high-level surface oxygen vacancies for the nanoceria,
as shown in Figure 4b, these particles were effective (p < 0.05)
in reducing intracellular ROS following 48 h exposure at 50 μg
mL–1 relative to cells in medium-only. Here, we
also found that the 10 at. % Si- and Ta-doped ceria particles, both
with a relatively high-level surface oxygen vacancies (although lower
when compared to the nanoceria), were effective in significantly (p < 0.05) scavenging the intracellular ROS compared to
cells in medium-only. The ROS scavenging effects, however, were absent
at higher dopant concentrations of 30 and 50 at. % for both Si and
Ta, as there was no difference in the level of intracellular ROS of
cells exposed to these particles compared to cells exposed to medium-only.
Interestingly, the low presence of oxygen vacancies for these particles
was not the underlying reason for the phenomena. Analysis of particle
uptake by the cell revealed low levels of particle internalization
for the nanoceria doped with 30 and 50 at. % Si and Ta (Figure 4c). This is in contrast to
the particle uptake observed with the nanoceria and the 10 at. % Si-
and Ta-doped particles (Figure 4c). Taken together, these data suggest that the cells selectively
internalized the nanoceria and those doped with low level of either
Si or Ta to subsequently modulate the intracellular ROS levels. It
is thought that the low-level surface defects (and surface oxygen)
for the >10 at. % Si- and Ta-doped samples, likely due to the significant
presence of SiO2 surface layers for the Si-doped samples
and the limited oxygen storage/release capacity on the surface for
the Ta-doped samples, inform the variations in the cellular uptake
of the particles and subsequently the intracellular ROS scavenging.
Further, the uptake observed appears to be independent of the particle
morphology as the doped nanoceria exhibited a round-shaped morphology
as compared to the rhomboidal nanoceria (also note that the nanoceria
and the doped variants were associated with comparable ∼200
nm aggregate size in the culture medium, Table S2).

(p < 0.05) as determined by one-way ANOVA. (c)

In summary, the present work modulated the presence of oxygen
vacancies
in nanoparticles through creation of structural distortion. Intended
for a biological antioxidant activity, the nanoparticles with redox
cycling capability, nanoceria (Ce3+/Ce4+), were
doped with smaller ionic radii and/or mismatched ionic valency dopants,
Si4+ and Ta5+. The controlled design of these
particles facilitated not only the transformation in the particle
morphology but also, interestingly, the migration of the oxygen vacancies
from the surface of the particles to the bulk structure with increasing
dopant concentrations. Ultimately, the study found that the uptake
of nanoparticles by cells was dependent on the level of surface oxygen
vacancies that subsequently enabled scavenging of intracellular ROS.
Particles with low levels of surface oxygen vacancies were not bioavailable,
with no uptake by the macrophage cells used in this study. Thus, the
realization of the therapeutic potential of antioxidant nanoparticles
requires engineering of the particles for enhanced surface defects.
This is for the accessibility of their oxygen vacancies and in turn
the ROS scavenging activity, and equally important, for the cellular
uptake of the nanoparticles.

Experimental Section
Synthesis of Nanoceria,
Si-Doped Nanoceria, and Ta-Doped Nanoceria
The particles
were synthesized using FSP as described previously.26 For the nanoceria, xylene-dissolved liquid precursor,
cerium 2-ethylhexanoate (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9%, 0.5 M Ce final concentration
in the precursor), was fed to the center of the flame by a syringe
pump. For the synthesis of Si- and Ta-doped CeO2, tetraethyl
orthosilicate (98%) and tantalum(V) ethoxide (99.98%) were used as
dopant precursors, respectively. The liquid precursor was fed at 5
mL/min and dispersed with 5 L/min oxygen. During the synthesis, a
constant pressure drop of 1.5 bar at the nozzle tip was maintained
by adjusting the annular orifice gap (0.15 mm spacing, at 6 mm radius
from the center of nozzle). The spray flame was surrounded and ignited
by premixed methane/oxygen-supporting flame (1.5/3.2 L/min respectively).
Supplied through a sintered metal plate ring (8 mm wide, at 9 mm inner
radius from the center of nozzle), an additional 5 L/min oxygen flow
was provided as a sheath for the supporting flame. The steep flame
temperature gradient causes supersaturation of the metal vapor to
form nuclei. As the flame temperature reduces downstream, the nuclei
coalesce, sinter, and agglomerate and get collected as nanoparticles
on fiberglass filters (Whatmann, GF/D) by the assistance of a vacuum
pump (Alcatel SD series).

Characterization of Neat, Si-Doped, and Ta-Doped
Ceria Nanoparticles
TEM
High-resolution TEM (HR-TEM)
images of the particles
were captured with a Phillips CM200 microscope operating at 200 kV
equipped with a SIS CCD camera.

XRD
XRD analysis
of the particles was performed using
a Phillips X’Pert MPD diffractometer with a Cu Kα radiation
source (λKα1 = 1.54056 Å and λKα2 = 1.54494 Å) scanning in the 2θ range between
10° and 100° with a 0.02° step size and a scan time
of 1 s per step. PANalytical X’pert HighScore Plus software
was used to determine the crystallite characteristics and average
size with reference to cerianite.

Zeta Potential
The analysis was carried out using a
Brookhaven ZetaPlus analyzer (operating with palladium electrodes)
on 0.1 g L–1 particle suspension adjusted to pH
2–11 with KOH or HNO3.

O2-TPD Measurements
O2-TPD was
used to examine the OSC of the particles. Samples were loaded in a
quartz U-tube on a plug of quartz wool. Samples were pretreated to
remove any adsorbed water by heating under He at 20 mL/min (Coregas,
>99.996%) to 150 °C (at 5 °C/min). The samples were then
cooled to room temperature and saturated with O2 at 20
mL/min for 2 h (Coregas, >99.95%) with any physisorbed O2 being removed with a 2 h purge under He. Profiles were then recorded
as the samples were heated at 5 °C/min to 900 °C under He
at 20 mL/min.

H2-TPR Measurements
H2-TPR analysis
of the particles was carried out by passing 10% H2 in He
at 25 mL/min with 10 °C/min ramp from room temperature, followed
by hold at 850 °C. H2 consumption was measured by
a thermal conductivity detector. Prior to analysis, the particles
were heated to 250 °C for 0.5 h to eliminate carbonates and/or
other interfering adsorbed species.

XPS
XPS spectra
were recorded on a Thermo ESCALAB250Xi
spectrometer with monochromated Al Kα energy (1486.68 eV). For
the depth profiling, the samples were etched across a 2.5 × 2.5
mm region with a reference etching rate of 0.18 nm/s.

Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
Surface Area
N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms
were recorded on a
Micromeritics Tristar 3030 system to determine the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area at −196 °C. The samples were pretreated
at 150 °C for 3 h under vacuum.

Monocyte/Macrophage Interactions
with Nanoceria
Culture of U937 Cells
The human
leukaemic monocyte
lymphoma cell line, U937, was maintained in a monocytic cell suspension
in RPMI-1640 culture medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum,
100 U mL–1 penicillin, and 100 mg mL–1 streptomycin in a humidified incubator (5% CO2/95% air
atmosphere at 37 °C). Treatment of U937 cells with phorbol 12-myristate
13-acetate (PMA) mimics the activation/differentiation of monocytes
in vivo. Cells were activated for 72 h with the addition of 100 nM
PMA to the culture medium prior to experimentation.

Cell Proliferation
Analysis
The activated U937 cells
were seeded in six-well tissue culture polystyrene plates at a density
of 2 × 105 cells/well in 3 mL of medium. The cells
were incubated for 4 h prior to the addition of 50 μg mL–1 nanoceria or without nanoceria. Cell viability was
analyzed at 48 h following nanoceria addition using an automated cell
viability analyzer (ViCell, Beckman Coulter) that is based on trypan
blue exclusion dye analysis.

Cellular ROS and Nanoceria
Uptake Analyses
The level
of cellular ROS was measured using the intracellular peroxide-dependent
oxidation of 2-,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diaceteate (DCFH-DA)
to form a fluorescent compound, 2-, 7-dichlorofluorescein (DCF).7−9 The activated U937 cells were seeded in six-well tissue culture
polystyrene plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well
in 3 mL of medium and incubated for 4 h prior to the addition of 50
μg mL–1 nanoceria. The presence of intracellular
ROS was determined at 48 h following the addition of nanoceria. Cells
exposed to medium-only were analyzed to determine the basal level
of intracellular ROS. Cells exposed to 4% (w/v) ethanol were used
as a control for dead cells and cellular debris for the flow cytometry
analysis. The activated U937 cells were removed from culture dishes
by trypsinization and resuspended in Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered
saline, pH 7.4 (DPBS). The cells were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for
6 min, the supernatant was removed, and the cells were resuspended
in 1 mL of DPBS and incubated with 10 mM DCFH-DA for 30 min at 37
°C prior to analysis by flow cytometry. For each sample, data
was acquired for 104 gated events using a flow cytometer
(BD FACSort) by measuring the fluorescence intensity along with the
number of cells. Data was analyzed using the commercial software,
FCS 4 Express. Cellular uptake of nanoparticles was also assessed
by measuring the side scatter of each condition.
