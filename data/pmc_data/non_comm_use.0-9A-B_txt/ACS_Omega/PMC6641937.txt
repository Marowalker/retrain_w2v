Facile synthesis
for Dabigatran etexilate mesylate (1), an anticoagulant
drug, is reported using a novel synthon, n-hexyl-4-nitrophenyl
carbonate (32), which
substantially eliminates the formation of potential impurities 20–27, which were generated due to the
use of n-hexyl chloroformate in previously reported
methods. Pinner reaction to prepare a key and critical intermediate,
amidine 8, was optimized using design of experiment software
to establish critical process parameters to achieve 8 in 97% yield. Nucleophilic substitution of 8 with novel
synthon n-hexyl-4-nitrophenyl carbonate (32) furnished the dabigatran base 9, which was then converted
to its mesylate salt using methane sulfonic acid to provide 1 with an overall yield of 66% over three steps.

Introduction
Dabigatran etexilate mesylate (1), chemically known
as β-Alanine, N-[[2-[[[4-[[[(hexyloxy)carbonyl]amino]iminomethyl]phenyl]amino]methyl]-1-methyl-1H-benzimidazol-5-yl]carbonyl]-N-2-pyridinylethyl
ester, methanesulfonate, is a direct thrombin inhibitor used to reduce
the risk of stroke and blood clots in people who have a medical condition
called atrial fibrillation.1 Dabigatran
etexilate mesylate (1), which is the double prodrug of
the active substance, dabigatran (29, Figure 1), was developed by Boehringer
Ingelheim and was approved by the USFDA in 20102 and the EMA in 20083 under the
trade name Pradaxa.

Figure 1 Active substance dabigatran (29) and its
etexilate
mesylate (1).

Patients with atrial fibrillation are at an increased risk
of forming
a blood clot in the heart, which can travel to the brain or other
parts of the body and cause a stroke. Dabigatran lowers the chance
of having a stroke by helping prevent clots from forming. It is also
used to treat blood clots in the veins of legs (deep vein thrombosis)
or lungs (pulmonary embolism) and to reduce the risk of them occurring
again after initial treatment is completed.4

The first reported synthesis of dabigatran etexilate (9) involves N-acylation of pyridine amino
propanoate
(3) with 4-methylamino-3-nitro benzoyl chloride (2) to furnish nitro amino propanoate (4), which
was then reduced to amino amide 5 under catalytic hydrogenation
conditions. Coupling of amino amide 5 with acid 6 in acetic acid in the presence of CDI provided nitrile 7 (Scheme 1).5

Scheme 1 First Reported Syntheses of Dabigatran
Etexilate (9)
A Pinner reaction of nitrile 7 using approximately
83 volumes of saturated ethanolic HCl under ambient temperature for
12–15 h provided imino ester 7a (Figure 2), which then reacted in situ
with ammonium carbonate in ethanol to furnish amidine 8. Purification of 8 by column chromatography and subsequent
reaction with n-hexyl chloroformate in tetrahydrofuran
(THF) provided dabigatran etexilate 9, which required
purification by column chromatography. The reported process (Scheme 1) is onerous from
the manufacturing point of view as the intrinsic fragility of nitrile 7, under highly acidic conditions employed with the Pinner
reaction, leads to the formation of unacceptable levels of impurities 28 and 29 (Figure 2), which further react with n-hexyl
chloroformate in subsequent reactions to generate impurities 33 and 34, respectively (Figure 2). Apart from this, a set of eight impurities, 20–27 (Table 1), identified in various concentrations in
product 9, was attributed to the reaction of 8 with analogous impurities (12–19, Table 1), which
are usually present in n-hexyl chloroformate.6 The use of column chromatography purifications
at multiple stages of the synthesis, tedious workup procedures, formation
of several impurities (28, 29, 33, 34, and 20–27), and
the control, management, and generation of huge amounts of effluent
make this process inefficient, costly, and difficult to scale.

Figure 2 Genesis of
impurities 28, 29, 33, and 34 in the reported synthesis of 1.

Table 1 Impurities in 1 Formed
Due to the Use of n-Hexyl Chloroformate in the Reported
Methods
The second-generation
synthesis reported (Scheme 2)7 for 9 exploited
an alternative route wherein amino amide 5 was condensed
with acid 10 in the presence of a coupling
agent to give oxadiazole 11, which was hydrogenated in
the presence of palladium catalyst to provide amidine 8, which was subsequently reacted with n-hexyl chloroformate
to provide dabigatran etexilate (9). Although this process
avoids the cumbersome Pinner reaction, it fails to address the control
strategy for the formation of impurities 20–27 (Table 1) due to the use of n-hexyl chloroformate. Several
other processes8−13 reported with minor modifications to the original process also failed
to address the above-mentioned issues related to the control of impurities.
Dabigatran etexilate mesylate (1) exhibits polymorphism,
and the processes reported14 for preparing
the polymorphs have also failed to address the issues discussed above.
Thus, we set out to design a facile and alternate synthetic strategy
for 1, which eliminates the number of impurities generated
in the previously reported process.

Scheme 2 Second-Generation
Syntheses Reported for Dabigatran Etexilate (9)7
Proficient synthesis of 1 is achieved by
(1) establishing
the robust process for a Pinner reaction for the synthesis of 8 by thorough optimization of the reaction using design of
experiment (DoE) to establish the critical process parameters (CPPs)
responsible for providing the desired yield and minimized level of
impurities 28–29, and (2) the identification,
synthesis, and use of active ester, n-hexyl-4-nitrophenyl
carbonate (32), as a novel synthon for the preparation
of 9, which circumvents the formation of impurities 20–27.

With the implementation of
these two strategies (Scheme 3), the dabigatran etexilate
mesylate (1) obtained is substantially free from potential
impurities and meets the regulatory norms in terms of quality. We
believe that the developed process provides a notable advantage over
the reported processes in the literature in terms of scope and as
a more practical alternative for a scalable synthesis of 1.

Synthesis of 1
Results and Discussion
Process optimization using one-factor-at-a-time
is often deficient
in providing a coefficient contribution for the individual parameters
on the outcome of the process, especially when many variables are
involved and their empirical relationships need to be evaluated.15 Under such circumstances, a large number of
experiments are required, which may also lead to the drawing of inaccurate
conclusions many a times. Hence, statistical design of experiment
(DoE) tool was employed for the process optimization of the Pinner
reaction to prepare amidine 8. DoE software used for
the optimization study was a free trial version of STAVEX, with version
5.2.

Process Development of 8 Using DoE
The process development
work started with nitrile compound 7 (Scheme 3) as the syntheses of amidine 8 and dabigatran etexilate (9) were the most
critical and cost-contributing steps in the entire process. Preliminary
screening was performed for the synthesis of 8 by selecting
different input variables such as strength of ethanolic HCl (25–36%
w/w), reaction time (2–10 h), reaction temperature (25–65
°C), and volume of ethanolic HCl (5–40 volumes with respect
to 7).

On the basis of the outcome of the initial
screening experiments, we identified that an HCl strength of less
than 33% (w/w) required prolonged reaction times and led to the hydrolysis
of 7a into 7b and 7c, which
in turn resulted in the formation of impurities 28 and 29 (Figure 2). Thus, reaction temperature and volume of ethanolic HCl were determined
to be critical to the Pinner reaction and hence were considered for
further optimization using DoE wherein strength of HCl and reaction
time were fixed (Table 2).

Table 2 Parameters that Were Held Constant
during DoE Optimization Based on the Outcome of Preliminary Screening
Sr. no.	parameter	limit	reason for
fixing the parameter	
1	strength of HCl	34–36% (w/w)	strength ≤ 34 required
prolonged hours for reaction completion, which led to the hydrolysis
of 7a into 7b and 7c, which
in turn resulted in the formation of impurities 28 and 29	
2	reaction time	6 h	more than 6 h irrespective of ranges of any
other parameters
led to the hydrolysis of 7a into 7b and 7c, which in turn resulted in the formation of impurities 28 and 29	
Accordingly, a two-factor definitive screening factorial
DoE with
one center point was performed to optimize the ideal quantity of ethanolic
HCl and reaction temperature with respect to the response variables,
such as formation of the impurities 28–29 and the yield of 8. Low and high range limits (Table 3) for these two parameters
were selected based on the results of the previous set of optimization
experiments.

Optimization Using DoE

Sr. no.	parameter	unit	low	high	
1	reaction temperature	°C	25	41	
2	volume of EtOH-HCl	times (with respect to 7)	5	15	
The experiments were performed as per the design, and the results
are captured in Table 4. On the basis of the experimental results, it is evident that the
reaction temperature of around 41 °C with just 5 volumes of ethanolic
HCl is optimum to maximize the conversion of 7–8 while minimizing impurity formation. The best condition
provided 2.1% of impurity 28 and around 1.3% of impurity 29 and maximum yield of 8 in around 97% in the
set of nine experiments (entry 3, Table 4).

using ethanol and ethyl acetate.

c Unreacted compound 7.

The formation of impurities 28 and 29 could be controlled by lowering the reaction temperature
(25 °C)
and increasing the volume of ethanolic HCl, but the reaction was incomplete
and hence results in low yields (entries 4 and 7, Table 4). The two-dimensional contour
plots generated by DoE software for the effect of the temperature
range from 25 to 41 °C and the volume of ethanolic HCl over the
range of 5–15 volumes for the response variable, that is, purity
and yield of 8, are shown in Figures 3 and 4, respectively.
The purity increases from 88 to ∼96% while proceeding toward
the pink region of the plot as the volume of ethanolic HCl is decreased
from 15 to 5 at a temperature of 41 °C (Figure 3). The yield increases from 91 to ∼97%
while proceeding toward the red region of the plot as the volume of
ethanolic HCl is decreased from 15 to 5 at a temperature of 41 °C
(Figure 4). The orange
region indicates the lowest purity and yield in Figures 3 and 4, respectively,
and while moving toward the green, blue, and pink regions, the purity
and yield increase. Similarly, the three-dimensional surface plots
for the effect of volume of ethanolic HCl and temperature of reaction
for the response variable, viz., yield and purity of 8, are also shown in Figures 5 and 6, respectively.

Once the desired conversion of 7 to 7a was achieved, the reaction mixture was basified with ammonia gas
until a neutral pH was achieved, and 7a was subsequently
reacted with ammonium carbonate at 28–32 °C to obtain 8. We were able to further control the amounts of impurities 28 and 29 that contaminated 8 by
using a mixture of ethanol and ethyl acetate in a purification process.
Volumes of these solvents were optimized to achieve the desired yield
and quality of 8.

Synthesis of 9 Using Novel Synthon n-Hexyl-4-nitrophenyl Carbonate
(32)
To circumvent
the limitations associated with the use of n-hexyl
chloroformate with respect to the formation of several analogous impurities
(20–27), we explored the use of a
novel synthon, n-hexyl-4-nitrophenyl carbonate (32), for the synthesis of 9. N-Hexyl-4-nitrophenyl carbonate (32) was reacted with
amidine 8 to provide pure 9 without formation
of impurities 20–27 that are associated
with n-hexyl chloroformate. However, the synthesis
of n-hexyl chloroformate using pure fractions of n-hexanol and phosgene derivatives was not considered because
the phosgene and its derivatives are highly hazardous to health and
are highly corrosive in nature.16 Additionally,
the conversion of 8 to 9 was incomplete even after employing
the excess quantity of n-hexyl chloroformate for
the reaction. Thus, we explored the safe and efficient transformation
of 8 to 9 using novel synthon 32.

The synthesis of n-hexyl-4-nitrophenyl carbonate
(32) was achieved by reacting commercially available
bis-(4-nitrophenyl) carbonate (30) with a pure fraction
of n-hexanol (31) in dichloromethane
in the presence of triethylamine under ambient temperature (Scheme 3). Upon completion
of the reaction, the organic layer was washed with aqueous sodium
hydroxide to eliminate the byproduct p-nitro phenol
and concentrated under vacuum to obtain 32 as a light-brown
oil. The reaction between amidine 8 and active ester 32 occurred over 8–9 h in a mixture of acetonitrile
and water in the presence of potassium carbonate at 25–30 °C
(Scheme 3). As expected,
series of impurities (20–27) were
not detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis
of the reaction mixture. However, traces of impurities 28 and 29 found with amidine 8 were transformed
into impurities 33 and 34 (Figure 2) during the reaction conditions
but could be eliminated during the crystallization of 9 (acetone/water (5:4) mixture then acetonitrile), resulting in a
72% yield with 99.8% purity by HPLC. Traces of other impurities (36–40) observed at a level of ≥0.10%
in crude 1 (by HPLC) were identified, characterized by
LCMS, and synthesized. These impurities were also washed out in the
crystallization process established using an acetone/water mixture
followed by acetonitrile to provide the final API as per ICH guidelines.17

Control Strategy for the Impurities
The structures
of all of the impurities in dabigatran etexilate mesylate identified,
synthesized, and controlled in our endeavors are represented in Figure 7. Nitro phenol (35) was an obvious byproduct formed during the synthesis of 9, and the established purification process eliminated this
impurity. Impurity 36 was identified as a degradation
product of either 1 or 9, mainly formed
due to the hydrolysis of the amidine group when water was present.
The reaction temperature and workup procedures were optimized to control
this impurity. Impurity 37 proved to be a novel compound
that could be formed by the reaction of trace amounts of 5 with acetic acid (Scheme 4). Hence, by using a stoichiometric quantity of acetic acid,
we could control the formation of 37 during synthesis 7.

of Synthesis.

Scheme 4 Reaction Pathway
for the Formation of Impurity 37
Impurity 38 was also identified as a novel
compound,
ethyl N-{[2-({[4-amino{[3-methylpentyloxy)carbonyl]imino}methyl)
phenyl]amino}methyl)-1-methyl-1H-benzimidazol-5-yl]carbonyl}-N-pyridin-2-yl-β-alaninate, which was presumably formed
in the reaction between 3-methyl pentanol (39) present
in trace levels in n-hexanol and 30 to
furnish the active ester analogue, 3-methyl pentyl-4-nitrophenyl carbonate
(40). Traces of 40, in the presence of 8, can react to form impurity 38 (Scheme 3). The established purification
process, using a mixture of acetone/water followed by acetonitrile,
eliminated these impurities to provide the final API as per the ICH
guidelines.17

Conclusions
In
conclusion, the work described in this report provides the synthesis
of dabigatran etexilate mesylate (1) by using a novel
synthon, n-hexyl-4-nitrophenyl carbonate, which results
in the isolation of a final product, which is substantially free from
the literature-reported impurities. Our synthesis and purification
methods also allowed the removal of the impurities specific to this
new approach. Additionally, the process optimization for the synthesis
of amidine intermediate 8, using DoE, improved the classical
Pinner reaction conditions associated with the literature-reported
processes and provided a drastic improvement in yield. We believe
that this novel approach toward the synthesis of 1 provides
better scope and a more practical alternative to the existing processes
reported in the literature.

ethyl ester (8)
Ethanolic HCl (5.0 L, 36% w/w)
was charged to the reactor and to it was added 7 in portions
(0.20 kg × 5, 2.07 mol) at temperature below 35 °C; the
temperature was raised to 40–41 °C and the mixture was
stirred for 6 h. After completion of reaction (by HPLC), the reaction
mixture was cooled to 25–30 °C and diluted with ethanol
(15.0 L). The resulting reaction mixture was cooled to 0–5
°C, and ammonia gas was purged into the reaction mixture at temperature
between 0 and 15 °C until a pH ≥ 8 was achieved. To the
basified reaction mixture was added ammonium carbonate (0.75 kg, 7.80
mol) at 0–10 °C; the temperature was raised to 28–32
°C and the mixture was stirred for 10 h. After completion of
the reaction (by HPLC), the reaction mixture was cooled to 25–30
°C and filtered. The obtained inorganic salt was washed with
ethanol (5.0 L). The combined filtrate was distilled under vacuum
at temperature below 50 °C to remove ethanol and obtain a residue.
To the resulting residue was added ethanol (5.0 L) and heated to 75–80
°C for 1.0 h. To the hot solution was added ethyl acetate (10.0
L) and the suspension was heated to 75–80 °C for 1.0 h.,
cooled to 25–30 °C for 1.0 h., and the precipitated product
was filtered and washed with ethyl acetate (1.0 L). The wet solid
was dried for 4 h at 50–55 °C to furnish 0.99 kg (97%
yield) of the title compound 8. HPLC purity: 97.83%.

Synthesis
of Dabigatran Etexilate Mesylate (1)
Acetone
(7.0 L) and dabigatran etexilate (9, 1.0 kg,
1.59 mol) were charged to the reactor, and the suspension was heated
to 40–45 °C until dissolution; the clear solution was
filtered over a celite bed and the bed was washed with acetone (1.0
L). The combined filtrate was cooled to 25–30 °C; to the
resulting suspension, a solution of methane sulfonic acid (prepared
by using methane sulfonic acid 0.15 kg, 1.56 mol diluted with 4.5
L acetone) was added. The precipitated salt was stirred at 25–30
°C for 1.0 h and then cooled to 17–23 °C and stirred
for 1.0 h. The precipitated salt was filtered and washed with acetone
(1.0 L). The resulting wet material was dried for 5 h at 40–45
°C to furnish 1.090 kg (95% yield) of 1. HPLC purity:

Preparation
of Ethyl 2-{[(4-{[(Hexyloxy)carbonyl]carbamimidoyl}phenyl)amino]methyl-1-methyl-1H-benzimidazol-5-carboxylate (33)
2-Methyl THF (450 mL), purified water (220 mL), and compound 28 (20 g, 0.056 mol) were charged to the round-bottom flask.
To the resulting suspension, potassium carbonate solution (prepared
by using 16.6 g, 0.120 mol K2CO3 dissolved in
water 65.0 mL) was added. To the obtained solution was added a solution
of n-hexyl-4-nitrophenyl carbonate (32) (prepared by dissolving n-hexyl-4-nitrophenyl
carbonate 13.84 g, 0.051 mol, in 2-methyl THF 30 mL). The reaction
was stirred for 10 h at 28–30 °C. After completion of
the reaction (by HPLC), 2-methyl THF was distilled under vacuum, and
the desired product was extracted into dichloromethane (100 mL ×
2). The combined dichloromethane was concentrated under vacuuo at
below 40 °C to obtain a syrup. To the resulting syrup was added
acetone (70 mL) and stirred until dissolution. Water (60 mL) was added
to the solution, and the precipitated product was stirred for 1 h,
filtered, and washed with diisopropyl ether (20 mL). The solid was
dried for 3 h at 50–55 °C to furnish 13 g (47.6% yield)
