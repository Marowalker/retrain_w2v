In
the past, sodium alanate, NaAlH4, has been widely
investigated for its capability to store hydrogen, and its potential
for improving storage properties through nanoconfinement in carbon
scaffolds has been extensively studied. NaAlH4 has recently
been considered for Li-ion storage as a conversion-type anode in Li-ion
batteries. Here, NaAlH4 nanoconfined in carbon scaffolds
as an anode material for Li-ion batteries is reported for the first
time. Nanoconfined NaAlH4 was prepared by melt infiltration
into mesoporous carbon scaffolds. In the first cycle, the electrochemical
reversibility of nanoconfined NaAlH4 was improved from
around 30 to 70% compared to that of nonconfined NaAlH4. Cyclic voltammetry revealed that nanoconfinement alters the conversion
pathway, and operando powder X-ray diffraction showed that the conversion
from NaAlH4 into Na3AlH6 is favored
over the formation of LiNa2AlH6. The electrochemical
reactivity of the carbon scaffolds has also been investigated to study
their contribution to the overall capacity of the electrodes.

Introduction
Conversion-type electrodes
are interesting alternatives to conventional
intercalation electrodes for Li-ion batteries mainly due to their
high capacities. In conversion-type electrodes, lithium reacts with
the electrode material through a simple reaction that is generally
described as follows: MaXb + (b·n)Li
↔ aM + bLinX, where M is a transition metal, X is an anion, and n is the oxidation state of X. However, this class of electrodes
is still far from reaching commercial applications, as the electrodes
suffer from large voltage hysteresis between the discharge and charge
reactions; poor Coulombic efficiency in the first cycle; and, in many
cases, poor cycling performance due to structural reorganization,
particle decohesion, and phase separation.1 Hence, design and investigation of novel conversion-type electrode
materials is needed to develop upon this class of materials.

Metal hydride materials, which have previously been investigated
as hydrogen storage materials for energy purposes,2 are now receiving increased attention as a new class of
electrode materials.3 Light-element hydrides
possess higher gravimetric and volumetric energy densities than those
of any known conversion-type material. The properties of magnesium
hydride, MgH2, as an electrode were first investigated
by Oumellal and co-workers, and it was shown to have a high reversible
capacity of 1480 mA h/g and small voltage hysteresis of ∼0.2
V.4 The use of a metal hydride as a negative
electrode of rechargeable batteries is not limited to binary metal
hydride systems; complex transition metal hydrides, Mg2MHx (M = Fe, Co, Ni),5 and lightweight alkaline alanates have also been considered.6−8

Sodium alanate, NaAlH4, has a theoretical gravimetric
capacity of 1985 mA h/g. A two-step conversion lithiation reaction
of NaAlH4 is described by Latroche and co-workers, as follows6 1   2  The complete
conversion reaction involves
the exchange of four Li ions through the formation of the intermediate
LiNa2AlH6. This reaction pathway is based on
observations made by powder X-ray diffraction. Subsequently, Reale
and co-workers proposed the existence of a second conversion path
via Na3AlH6 through observations made by in
situ powder X-ray diffraction through the following reaction7 3  The possible co-existence
of two intermediates
makes the electrochemical conversion of NaAlH4 a more complicated
system than typical hydride systems. However, similar to other conversion-type
electrodes, NaAlH4 also suffers from poor reversibility,
which may be attributed to the large volume change and phase separation
during electrochemical operation. This calls for new approaches to
improve the performance of metal hydrides as conversion-type electrodes.

Nanoconfinement is a bottom-up approach wherein a material is infiltrated
into a chemically inert nanoporous scaffold. This approach effectively
limits the particle size to the size of the pores and cavities in
the scaffold and may also reduce phase separation during chemical
conversion.9,10 Nanoporous carbon aerogels with
varying pore sizes and volumes are often used as the confining scaffolds,
and a wide range of different metal hydrides have been nanoconfined,
with a focus on hydrogen storage properties, for example, MgH2, NaAlH4, and reactive hydride composites, 2LiBH4–MgH2.9,11−14 There is a strong kinetic effect for hydrogen release and uptake
and a smaller “nanoeffect” for pore sizes (D) <∼30 nm.15 One advantage of
carbon aerogel scaffolds is that the surface area and pore volume
can be increased by a postsynthetic treatment (heating to >600
°C
in CO2), typically referred to as activation, while maintaining
a relatively constant pore size.16,17 Thus, relatively
large amounts of active metal hydride material can be infiltrated
to reach large energy densities, with potential for use in both batteries
and hydrogen storage. Compared to those in nonactivated carbon aerogel,
NaAlH4 in activated-carbon aerogel shows slower kinetics
but a more stable hydrogen storage capacity upon cycling.16 The carbon scaffolds are electronically conductive
and also function as an effective current collector for the electrode
as an intimate contact to the conversion-type metal hydride is maintained.
This property is similar to that of metallic sponges, for example,
Ni sponges, which are often employed in electrode fabrication.18 Moreover, the small particle size of the confined
electrode material and the high surface area reduce the diffusion
distances of Li ions and improve the reactivity. Nanoconfinement in
mesoporous carbon has been used for improving the performances of
conversion electrodes such as FeF2 and P.19,20 It has been reported that MgH2 nanoconfined in porous
carbon (surface area, SBET = 500 m2/g) after ball milling demonstrates good cyclic stability.21 These results encourage further studies for
enhancing the properties of light-element metal hydride electrodes
by nanoconfinement, which is the focus of the present investigations.

In this article, we report on the electrochemical performance of
NaAlH4 nanoconfined by melt infiltration in two types of
conductive mesoporous carbon scaffolds that have previously been investigated
in rechargeable batteries: resorcinol formaldehyde carbon aerogel22,23 and CMK-3.24−26 We show through cyclic voltammetry (CV) and operando
synchrotron radiation powder X-ray diffraction (SR-PXD) that nanoconfinement
alters the reaction mechanism of the lithiation process.

Results and Discussion
To study the effect of nanoconfinement in different mesoporous
carbon scaffolds on the electrochemical reactivity of NaAlH4, electrode samples of NaAlH4 melt-infiltrated into a
resorcinol formaldehyde carbon scaffold (Na_CA) and into a mesoporous
carbon CMK-3 (Na_CMK3) as well as a sample of ball-milled NaAlH4 (Na_BM) were prepared (see Table 1).

Carbon aerogel
and CMK-3 were prepared by pyrolysis at a high temperature
(≥800 °C), followed by further heat treatment. This treatment
eliminates hydrogen and oxygen in the carbon scaffolds27,28 and thereby eliminates possible reactions between the scaffold and
NaAlH4 during melt infiltration. Furthermore, it is reported
that carbon materials demonstrate large voltage hysteresis, and the
extent of hysteresis is proportional to the hydrogen content.29 Thus, removal of the H-group helps reduce hysteresis
by minimizing the quasireversible binding between Li and the hydrogen-terminated
edges of the scaffold.28

Before infiltration,
both CA and CMK-3 have surface areas of above
1000 m2/g. CMK-3 has a uniform pore size of 4.7 nm, whereas
CA has a broader pore size distribution, with an average diameter
of 24.3 nm (see Supporting Information Figure S1). After infiltration, both the surface area and total pore
volume of the carbons, as determined by N2 adsorption measurements,
decrease dramatically (see Table 2). Both CA and CMK-3 comprise fully accessible and
highly interconnected pore networks. In such open pore spaces, percolative
blocking (e.g., due to pore mouth blocking) is highly unlikely, especially
for nitrogen molecules. In this respect, the decrease in the amount
adsorbed (and thus the deduced pore volume) is a very strong indication
of successful NaAlH4 infiltration.

a Calculation based on the quantity
of NaAlH4 being added for melt infiltration.

b Calculated from the bulk density
of NaAlH4 and the total pore volume of the scaffold.

In the case of the CA scaffold,
NaAlH4 infiltration
leads to an almost 80% reduction in the initial total pore volume
(from 2.04 to 0.38 cm3/g), in good agreement with the theoretical
vol % hydride loading (as calculated based on the actual amount of
NaAlH4 used for the infiltration and its bulk density).
For Na_CMK3, the total pore volume decreases from 1.20 to 0.80 cm3/g, which corresponds to a filled pore volume of 33%, lower
than the theoretical loading of 46 vol %. This deviation suggests
that in the case of CMK-3 a small quantity of NaAlH4 might
also reside on the external surface of the carbon particles, without,
however, affecting the accessibility of the pores. Complete pore mouth
blocking or infiltration failure should be ruled out, as the former
would lead to zero N2 adsorption and the latter, to no
pore volume reduction for the NaAlH4/CMK-3 composite.

High-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) scanning transmission electron
microscopy (STEM) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental
mapping of a CA scaffold particle containing NaAlH4 shows
that NaAlH4 is dispersed in the CA scaffold and no significant
agglomeration is observed (see Figure 1). For Na_BM, particles >150 nm in diameter were
obtained
by ball milling (see Supporting Information Figure S2). We note that high-resolution TEM was attempted, but the
high-energy electron beam unfortunately caused the hydride to decompose.
The EDX spectrum of Na_BM confirms the absence of impurities from
the milling jars. Also, for Na_CA, no impurities were observed.

Figure 1 Representative
(a) HAADF-STEM image and EDX elemental mapping images
of (b) Na, (c) Al, and (d) C of Na_CA.

The PXD patterns of the as-prepared samples are shown in Figure 2a. After ball milling
of the as-received NaAlH4 (Na_BM), only diffraction from
NaAlH4 was observed, whereas in both nanoconfined samples
(Na_CA and Na_CMK3) a small amount of Al was observed due to partial
decomposition of NaAlH4 during infiltration. The amount
of Al in Na_CA is 3.45 wt % on the basis of Rietveld refinement. It
has been reported that nanoconfined NaAlH4 upon partial
decomposition decomposes into NaH and Al directly.30 Thus, the presence of the intermediate Na3AlH6 in Na_CMK3 suggests that some of the NaAlH4 is
not confined inside pores. Moreover, because the pore size of CMK-3
is 4.7 nm, the Bragg peaks of infiltrated NaAlH4 would
not be easily observable by PXD due to extensive peak broadening.
Hence, the sharp diffraction peaks from NaAlH4 in Na_CMK3
likely originate from noninfiltrated NaAlH4. In contrast,
an increase in the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) (without instrumental
correction) is evident in the PXD data of Na_CA after nanoconfinement;
for example, it increases from 0.075° in Na_BM to 0.107°
in Na_CA for the (112) peak at 2θ = 29.6°. However, for
a crystallite size of 24 nm (the average pore size), the expected
FWHM (without instrumental correction) is ∼0.34°. The
observed FWHM corresponds to a particle size of 102 nm (corrected
for instrumental broadening). Hence, by PXD, we mainly observe NaAlH4, which is not infiltrated into the scaffold. However, it
still confirms that besides Al no crystalline impurities are observed.
Moreover, it is evident that the particle size of even the surface
NaAlH4 is reduced compared to that in the ball-milled sample,
Na_BM. For the nanoconfined samples, the presence of amorphous scaffolds
is observed as contributions to the background signal below 2θ
∼ 35°.

Galvanostatic Test and PXD of NaAlH4 Electrodes
In Table 3, the
possible lithiation reactions of NaAlH4 are listed, with
their calculated potentials, Ecalc, versus
those of Li, as reported in previous publications.6−8 By Nernst’s
law ΔG = −nFEeq (where ΔG is the Gibbs free energy of the
reaction, n is the number of electrons, and F is the Faraday constant); a higher equilibrium potential
indicates a more negative ΔG, that is, a thermodynamically
more favorable reaction.

– (−39.43) = −139 kJ/mol) and converted to the
potential by ΔG = −nFEeq.

In the first
galvanostatic discharge (see Figure 3), all samples exceeded the theoretical capacity
(equivalent to four Li ions). The capacity observed at around 0.75–0.82
V versus Li is likely related to the formation of a solid electrolyte
interface (SEI).32 It is also known that
formation of LiAl alloy may occur at a low potential (0.29–0.36
V vs Li, see Table 3). The formation of SEI and LiAl alloy contribute to the extra capacity
of NaAlH4 electrodes. The experimental potentials are generally
lower than the predicted values, likely due to kinetic limitation.
Moreover, thermodynamic overpotential is neglected for the estimation
of potentials in the literature.

sodium alanate samples

(GITT) data of (b) Na_BM and (c) Na_CA at a rate of C/10. Inset: potential vs time of relaxation of the sample. The Li
equivalent for all data is calculated using only the mass of sodium
alanate.

For Na_BM, the potential is relatively
constant in between x = 0.3 and 2.2 Li equivalents.
From Table 3 it is
observed that conversion from NaAlH4 to LiNa2AlH6 (reaction 1) is slightly more thermodynamically favorable
than conversion to Na3AlH6 (reaction 3). Hence, the flat plateau
of Na_BM should correspond to reaction 1. Ex situ PXD of Na_BM after the first discharge confirms
that reaction 1 as well
as reactions 2 and 5 take place, as diffraction peaks from LiNa2AlH6, Na, Al, and LiAl are observed. LiH is not observable
because of the small scattering factor. There is no sign of formation
of Na3AlH6; thus, reaction 3 does not occur in the nonconfined sample
or occurs to a much smaller extent than in the nanoconfined sample.
This is in accordance with the observation made by Latroche et al.6

In contrast to that for Na_BM, the voltage
curve for Na_CA shows
a more gradual slope from x = 0.48 to 2.0 Li equivalents
in the first discharge. For Na_CA, ex situ PXD indicates that both reactions 1 and 3 occur (see Figure 4a), as weak reflection from Na3AlH6 is
observed along reflections from LiNa2AlH6, Na,
Al, and LiAl. Again, LiH is not observable because of the small scattering
factor. The potentials of reactions 1 and 3 are very close (a difference
of only 0.03 V), and these reactions may occur in parallel. Galvanostatic
intermittent titrations during discharge and charge of the Na_BM and
Na_CA samples (Figure 3b,c) result in relatively large voltage relaxations during 15 h under
open circuit voltage conditions. For Na_BM the relaxations are in
the range of 0.17–1.87 V, whereas for Na_CA, they range from
56 to 533 mV. This indicates that a large fraction of the high-voltage
hysteresis between charge and discharge is due to kinetic limitations
of the material. This even seems to be more severe in the ball-milled
material compared with the nanoconfined material. For Na_CA, wherein
around 50% recharge is achieved, a potential of 0.69 V is observed
at x(Li) = 2.75 after relaxation, whereas during
discharge, a potential of 0.43 is observed at 2.4 Li equivalents.
This voltage hysteresis can be ascribed to factors affecting the thermodynamics,
such as structural changes.

Figure 4 PXD data of (a) Na_BM, Na_CA, and Na_CMK3 after
the first discharge
and (b) Na_BM and Na_CA after recharging. All data are measured at
room temperature (RT) (λ = 1.5406 Å). Symbols: ○,
NaAlH4; Δ, LiNa2AlH6; ●,
Na3AlH6; “black spade suit”, Al;
*, Na; #, LiAl.

After the first discharge,
small peaks of NaAlH4 are
found in both Na_BM and Na_CA, suggesting that the conversion is not
fully complete. However conversion of NaAlH4 to LiNa2AlH6 and then to metallic Na and Al is confirmed
as is the formation of the LiAl alloy, which is also observed in both
samples. Na3AlH6 is only observed during the
discharge of the nanoconfined sample, Na_CA.

For Na_CMK3, the
discharge–charge curve is significantly
different, for example, the plateau at 0.45 V versus Li is significantly
shorter than that for the other samples, and even though Na_CMK3 has
a high capacity, only a small fraction seems to originate from the
desired conversion reaction of NaAlH4. As seen in Figure 4a, mainly the LiAl
alloy is formed during the first discharge of Na_CMK3. The Bragg peaks
at 2θ < 23° could be related to reactions between the
material and electrolyte. Upon cycling, the discharge–charge
curve of Na_CMK3 (not shown) becomes more similar to that of empty
CMK-3, as reported in the literature, which shows a large hysteresis
without any plateau in the charge cycle.33 Because Na_CMK3 is not very reactive, we focus only on Na_BM and
Na_CA in the following diffraction analysis.

Na_CA performs
better than Na_BM in the first charge. The initial
columbic efficiencies of Na_CA and Na_BM were around 70 and 30%, respectively.
Both samples had a plateau at 0.43 V versus Li, which is believed
to be attributed to the delithiation of Al. When the charge continued,
Na_CA had a second plateau at around 0.9 V versus Li and a small plateau
at 1.6 V versus Li. The two plateaus are attributed to the reformation
of the intermediates and NaAlH4. This interpretation is
supported by the PXD pattern of recharged Na_CA (see Figure 4b).

As Na_BM and Na_CA
are recharged, the Bragg peaks of the LiAl alloy
disappear. This is consistent with the delithiation of Al observed
at 0.43 V versus Li in the galvanostatic test. According to the galvanostatic
charge data, neither of the samples is fully reversible, and reflections
from Na and Al are observed in PXD (Figures 4b). The observation of Na in the recharged
state of Na_BM and Na_CA is in contrast to the findings in Reale’s
work, wherein Na is absent.7 In Reale’s
work, sodium stripping is suggested to be a reason for capacity loss.
Instead, the irreversibility could be due to poor diffusion of hydride,
which leads to inefficient conversion from Na, Al, and LiH. In Na_BM,
LiNa2AlH6 is converted back to NaAlH4 partially. In Na_CA, both intermediates, LiNa2AlH6 and Na3AlH6, are fully reconverted
to NaAlH4, which is in agreement with the increased reversibility
of Na_CA compared to that of Na_BM, as observed in the galvanostatic
test. Hence, the data suggest that for Na_CA the reversibility of reactions 1 and 3 is increased, whereas reactions 2 and 4 limit the reversibility
in both cases.

CV
The electrochemical reactions
occurring in the NaAlH4 samples and empty scaffolds were
further examined using CV,
see Figure 5. In the
first cycle, a peak appeared at 0.64–0.68 V versus Li for all
samples. This peak corresponds to the formation of SEI and it becomes
negligible from the second cycle. Empty scaffolds have a larger current
response for the formation of SEI than infiltrated scaffolds. This
is most likely because infiltration reduces the surface area of the
samples significantly (see Table 2) and results in less interaction between the scaffold
and electrolyte. Differences in the surface chemistry may also play
a role; however, because the infiltration process is unlikely to induce
significant changes in the surface groups of the carbon scaffold,
changes in the surface area is a more likely explanation.

Figure 5 Cyclic voltammograms
of (a) Na_BM, (b) Na_CA, (c) CA, (d) Na_CMK3,
and (e) CMK-3 at a scan rate of 0.1 mV/s.

During the first cycle of Na_BM, the sharp signal at a low
potential
(<0.35 V vs Li) is attributed to the lithiation of Al from reduction
of the alanate. When the scan is reversed, delithiation of Al is observed
at around 0.5 V versus Li and reformation of LiNa2AlH6, at 0.8 V versus Li. The magnitude of each current response
decreases in the subsequent cycles. There is little change in the
voltammogram after the fifth cycle. Interestingly, Na_CA acts differently
within the same potential range. More peaks are observed from 0.65
to 1.8 V versus Li in the reverse scan, meaning more reactions take
place (see Figure 5b). In contrast to Na_BM, Na_CA has a broad peak at a potential below
0.5 V versus Li, which is also observed in the voltammogram of empty
CA (see Figure 5c).
Intercalation of Li into carbon can happen at a low potential close
to 0 V versus Li.29,34,35 Therefore, the broadening of the peak may correspond to the intercalation
of Li into CA. When CA was scanned from 0.005 to 3.0 V versus Li,
very limited current response was observed, and no significant reactions
take place during the charge cycle. Hence, the peaks observed in Na_CA
are solely related to the reactivity of NaAlH4 and its
intermediates. In the second cycle, only three broad peaks remain,
suggesting poor to no reversibility of these reactions in Na_CA. In
the fifth cycle, the only remaining peak at 0.5 V versus Li is associated
with delithiation of Al. Similar to that in the published results,
the LiAl alloy here has an unsatisfactory long-term stability and
becomes irreversible.36,37 After 10 cycles, Na_CA acts similar
to empty CA. According to the voltammogram of Na_CA, the origin of
capacity can be divided into three parts upon cycling. The system
is dominated by the conversion of NaAlH4 → the lithiation/delithiation
of Al → carbon scaffold.

For Na_CMK3, CV also shows broadening
of the peak at a potential
below 0.42 V versus Li. In the reverse scan, the delithiation of Al
is more intense than that for Na_BM. Because of partial decomposition
of NaAlH4 during melt infiltration, Na_CMK3 already contains
Al before characterization. Hence, more LiAl alloy can be formed electrochemically.
This is also observed in Na_CA. There is another small peak at 0.89
V versus Li in Na_CMK3, but it is not reversible.

From the CV
results of infiltrated and empty carbon scaffolds,
it is found that the reactivity of nanoconfined NaAlH4 is
not a simple sum of the data measured separately for nonconfined NaAlH4 and the empty carbon scaffold. Nanoconfinement changes the
reaction mechanism. However, the peaks in the voltammograms are heavily
overlapped and it is difficult to distinguish each reaction step.
To acquire more information on the reaction mechanism, the samples
were investigated by operando SR-PXD.

Operando SR-PXD Studies
Figure 6 shows the
operando SR-PXD data of Na_BM
and Na_CA stacked as a function of Li uptake, x.
As the conversion of NaAlH4 is not complete in the operando
SR-PXD study (for both samples, less than 2.4 Li equivalents was exchanged),
we focus on the qualitative information, as the data provide very
useful information for understanding the effect of nanoconfinement
and the presence of the carbon scaffold on NaAlH4. The
lower capacity observed in these experiments is due to the higher
internal resistance of the operando cell compared to that of a normal
coin cell, resulting in a larger overpotential and the lower potential
limit being reached at a lower state of discharge, that is, at lower x(Li)-values.

Figure 6 Operando PXD patterns of the first discharge
of (a) Na_BM and (b)
Na_CA measured at MAXII beamline I711 (λ = 0.9940 Å) using
a galvanostatic current rate of C/20 and a cutoff
potential of 0.005 V. Symbols: ○, NaAlH4; Δ,
LiNa2AlH6; ●, Na3AlH6; *, Na; #, LiAl; ?, Li (foil); “black spade
suit”, Al (note that the Al peaks in the beginning of the experiments
originate either fully (Na_BM) or partly (Na_CA) from the Al-foil
current collector).

Before discharging (at x(Li) = 0.0), both samples
contain Al, which is either from partial decomposition of NaAlH4 or the Al-foil current collector in the operando battery
cell. For Na_BM, the conversion of NaAlH4 to LiNa2AlH6 is initiated at x(Li) = 0.27, as
expected. The intensity of LiNa2AlH6 increases
continuously up to x(Li) = 1.43. A fraction of the
LiNa2AlH6 may decompose into Na, Al, and LiH
with time, as demonstrated by the slightly decreasing intensity of
LiNa2AlH6 as well as the increasing intensity
of Na and Al. In contrast to the ex situ PXD result, Na3AlH6 also forms in Na_BM. The formation of Na3AlH6 initiates at a deeper discharge state of x(Li) = 1.07. This result is consistent with the reaction
mechanism proposed by Reale et al.7 As
mentioned previously, the conversion from NaAlH4 to Na3AlH6 is less favorable and a smaller amount of
Na3AlH6 is formed compared to that of LiNa2AlH6. The small amount of Na3AlH6 and poor resolution of the ex situ PXD pattern may explain
why Na3AlH6 is not found in the ex situ PXD
pattern (Figure 4a).

For Na_CA, the first conversion step is again the conversion to
LiNa2AlH6 occurring at x(Li)
= 0.57. Shortly after the formation of LiNa2AlH6, the formation of Na3AlH6 is also initiated,
at x(Li) = 0.63. Hence, the use of the carbon scaffold
seems to favor the conversion to Na3AlH6, which
is in accordance with the observations made by ex situ PXD. Compared
to that in Na_BM, there is less LiNa2AlH6 present
in Na_CA. As shown in Figure 6b, conversion to LiNa2AlH6 and Na3AlH6 occurs in parallel. This indicates that the
conversions to LiNa2AlH6 and Na3AlH6 are competing reactions. It is believed that alteration of
the reaction mechanism is most probably due to a kinetic factor because
thermodynamic effects are only expected when the particle size is
smaller than 2–3 nm.30

Cycling Stability
In the ex situ PXD of Na_BM and Na_CA
after 20 discharge–charge cycles, mainly Na, Al, and the LiAl
alloy are present (see Figure 7). The PXD patterns indicate that conversion to NaAlH4 or any intermediate becomes difficult after repeated cycles.
The capacities (mA h/g of NaAlH4) of the three NaAlH4 samples in the first 20 cycles are plotted in Figure 8a. Generally, all samples show
a significant fall in capacity between the first and second cycles.
One of the reasons of the rapid decrease in capacity is due to the
formation of SEI. However, nanoconfinement in the carbon scaffold
increases the capacity retention from around 23% (Na_BM) to 43% (Na_CA)
and 46% (Na_CMK3). After 20 discharge–charge cycles, Na_CMK3
has the highest capacity, while Na_BM has the lowest capacity.

Na_BM and Na_CA after 20 discharge–charge cycles

the same applied current. (c) Capacity of Na_CMK3 versus that of empty
CMK-3 under the same applied current. Insets: Coulombic efficiency
of the corresponding measurements.

From the previous sections, it is evident that the reversibility
of NaAlH4 diminishes gradually. As the carbon scaffolds
are found to be electrochemically active, it is important to access
their contribution toward the overall capacity of the electrodes.

Electrodes of Na_CA and CA containing the same amount of carbon
scaffold (0.9 mg) were tested by galvanostatic discharge–charge
cycling. Na_CA was cycled at a rate of C/10 on the
basis of the amount of NaAlH4, and the same current was
applied to CA. Na_CA has a higher capacity than that of CA during
the first five cycles, whereas the opposite is observed for the subsequent
cycles (see Figure 8b). The higher capacity of Na_CA during the initial five cycles is
due to the reactivity of NaAlH4.

After 20 cycles,
CA has a capacity of 0.70 mA h, which is equal
to 773 mA h/g CA with a Coulombic efficiency of 95.6%. Interestingly,
although the Coulombic efficiency is not very high, the capacity of
CA is significantly higher than the capacity of graphite (372 mA h/g).38 Na_CMK3 was also compared with CMK-3. The capacity
of CMK-3 is higher than that of Na_CMK3 in all cycles, and it retains
548 mA h/g of CMK-3 after 20 cycles. From Figures 8b,c, it is clear that carbon scaffolds contribute
to the overall reversible capacity, as is also revealed from the results
of CV.

Conclusions
We have presented the
electrochemical performance and electrochemically
driven conversion mechanism of the NaAlH4 anode nanoconfined
in mesoporous carbon scaffolds. The initial Coulumbic efficiency of NaAlH4 confined
in activated-carbon aerogel is at least twice that of ball-milled
NaAlH4. Using the activated-carbon aerogel also improves
the kinetics of the conversion from NaAlH4 to Na3AlH6 and thereby seems to alter the conversion mechanism.
However, it has been found that the capacity of nanoconfined NaAlH4 is initially dominated by the reactivity of the NaAlH4 and LiAl alloys but later by the carbon scaffold. The loss
in the reactivity of NaAlH4 could be related to inefficient
diffusion of the hydride, which may limit the extent of hydride conversion.

Nanoconfinement is a promising route for improving hydride electrodes;
however, research on nanoconfinement is still at a preliminary stage
and many aspects have to be considered. To enhance the reactivity
of nanoconfined hydride, it is important to maximize the loading of
hydride inside the scaffold, which will also increase the material
capacity. It is also interesting to study the influence of pore size
and different activation methods on the electrochemical reactivity
of the carbon scaffold. A smaller pore size of the scaffold is expected
to enhance the kinetics of the material and may also reduce polarization
of the electrode. New electrically conductive but inert scaffolds
may also need to be explored to understand the nanoconfinement effect
in more detail.

Methods
Apart from the synthesis
of the carbon scaffolds (resorcinol formaldehyde
carbon aerogel and CMK-3), all sample preparations and handling were
carried out in an argon-filled glovebox equipped with a circulation
purification system. The O2 and H2O levels were
below 1 ppm at all times.

Synthesis of Carbon Aerogel
Resorcinol
formaldehyde
carbon aerogel was prepared by mixing resorcinol (≥99.0%; Sigma-Aldrich),
formaldehyde (37 wt % in H2O, stabilized by 10–15%
methanol; Sigma-Aldrich), and Na2CO3 (99.999%;
Aldrich) in deionized water. The molar ratio was 1:2:8:0.0008 resorcinol/formaldehyde/H2O/Na2CO3. In general, for the synthesis
of the scaffold, the procedures described in refs (11) and (39) were used. Herein, the
mixture was aged at RT for 24 h, at 50 °C for 24 h, and at 90
°C for 72 h. After cooling, the carbon aerogel was soaked in
excess acetone. Finally, the carbon aerogel was pyrolysed at 800 °C
(ΔT/Δt = 3 °C/min)
under N2 flow for 6 h. The surface area and total pore
volume of the carbon aerogel was increased by heating the aerogel
to 950 °C (ΔT/Δt = 6 °C/min) in a constant CO2 flow for 5 h according
to the procedure described in ref (17). This procedure denoted activation of the resorcinol
formaldehyde carbon scaffold, and henceforth, this scaffold is denoted
as CA. The increased surface area and total pore volume would enhance
the infiltration of NaAlH4.16

Synthesis of CMK-3
The CMK-3-type carbon scaffold was
synthesized using a well-established nanocasting route, as described
in ref (40), using
SBA-15, a two-dimensional hexagonally ordered mesoporous silica, as
the template. The SBA-15 template was also prepared for this purpose
by adopting a standard surfactant-templating method, as described
in ref (41). The synthesized
SBA-15 silica template was infiltrated with a solution of sucrose
and sulfuric acid, carbonized by pyrolysis up to 900 °C under
N2 flow, and finally washed with HF at RT to remove the
silica. The as-prepared CMK-3 mesoporous carbon was further heat-treated
in a tubular furnace up to 700 °C under Ar flow to remove any
residual oxygen-containing groups produced on the carbon surface during
the synthetic steps. The sample obtained by this thermal treatment
is denoted as CMK-3.

Preparation of Nanoconfined and Ball-Milled
NaAlH4
Prior to melt infiltration, the carbon
scaffolds, CA and
CMK-3, were degassed in vacuum at 350 °C for several hours. For
melt infiltration, NaAlH4 (93%; Aldrich) and the degassed
scaffold were added to a Swagelok-type autoclave inside an Ar-filled
glovebox. To avoid decomposition of NaAlH4, melt infiltration
was performed at p(H2) = 210–230
bar.15 The mixture was heated to 195 °C
(ΔT/Δt = 2 °C/min)
and dwelled for 15 min; it was then cooled to RT. These samples are
denoted as Na_CA and Na_CMK3.

The reactivity of as-received
NaAlH4 was improved by ball milling for 2 h (5 min milling,
2 min pause, and 24 repetitions) using a Fritsch Pulverisette No.
6 with a speed of 350 rpm. The milling was performed in an 80 mL tungsten
carbide (WC) vial using 10 mm WC balls and a ball-to-powder mass ratio
of approximately 30:1. This sample of NaAlH4 is denoted
as Na_BM.

Surface Area and Pore Size Determination
The pore properties
of the CA and CMK-3 scaffolds and composites before and after melt
infiltration of NaAlH4 were deduced from N2 adsorption/desorption
measurements at 77 K using a Nova 2200e surface area and pore size
analyzer (Quantachrome Instruments). The surface area (SBET) was determined by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method, whereas the mean pore size (Dmax) was obtained from the desorption isotherm by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
method. The total pore volume (Vtot) was
calculated from the amount of N2 adsorbed at p/p0 = 0.98 (by assuming an adsorbate
density of 0.807 g/cm3).

EDX Spectroscopy
The composition of the prepared samples,
Na_BM and Na_CA, was characterized using an FEI Talos F200X scanning/transmission
electron microscope with a HAADF detector and EDX system. Powders
of the samples were added to anhydrous cyclohexane (99.5%; Sigma-Aldrich)
and a few drops of the suspension were spread onto the copper grid.
The sample grids were placed on a sample holder and transferred into
the chamber in air; hence, the samples were oxidized partially prior
to measurements.

Electrochemical Test
Coin cells
(CR2032) were assembled
in an Ar-filled glovebox. The working electrodes were prepared by
thoroughly grinding the samples with acetylene black (Cabot Corporation)
and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) (SAFT) powders in a 3:1:1 mass ratio.
Prior to mixing, the CMC binder and acetylene black were degassed
in vacuum at 80 °C overnight. In each cell, 3–6 mg of
the electrode mixture was used in the powdered form. The working electrode
was separated from the ∼100 μm thick Li metal (99.9%;
Aldrich) counter electrode by a piece of Whatman borosilicate glass-fiber
filter paper infused with 1 M LiPF6 in 1:1 ethylene carbonate
(EC)/dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (99,9%, H2O content <20
ppm; Solvionic).

The electrochemical tests were carried out
using a Bio-Logic MPG2 multichannel battery cycler. For the galvanostatic
discharge–charge tests, the coin cells were cycled in a potential
window between 0.005 and 3.0 V versus Li at a current rate of C/10. When carrying out GITT, a C/10 rate
was used, and the relaxation time of each step was 15 h. For calculation
of the theoretical cell capacity (and thus the current rate), NaAlH4 was considered as the only active material. For CV, the cells
were scanned from the open circuit potential to 0.005 V versus Li
and then reversed to 3.0 V versus Li. The rate of scanning was 0.1
mV/s for all samples.

PXD
The as-prepared samples and
electrodes at selected
discharge–charge states were characterized by PXD using a Rigaku
SmartLab diffractometer (Cu Kα1 radiation, λ
= 1.5406 Å) with transmission geometry. The measurements were
conducted with an angular step of 3° per minute. All samples
were mounted in 0.5 mm diameter Lindemann glass capillaries. For the
electrode samples, coin cells were disassembled after the electrochemical
tests and electrode powders were removed, ground, and mounted in capillaries
inside an Ar-filled glovebox.

Operando SR-PXD was performed
using electrochemical test cells of the AMPIX cell-type,42 which is specially designed for transmission
synchrotron studies of electrochemically driven reactions. Approximately
4–6 mg of electrode materials were mounted in the cells in
an Ar-filled glovebox using ∼100 μm thick Li metal foil
as the counter electrode and a microporous glass-fiber separator (Whatman
GF/B) with 1 M LiPF6 in 1:1 EC/DMC as the liquid electrolyte.
A piece of aluminum foil (thickness ∼0.011 mm) was placed behind
the working electrode to ensure uniform conductivity. The operando
SR-PXD data were collected at beamline I711, MAXII in Lund, Sweden,
using a selected wavelength of λ = 0.9940 Å. Diffraction
patterns were collected in transmission geometry every 10 min with
45 s of exposure time using a large-area CCD detector. During collection
of the SR-PXD data, the cell was galvanostatically discharged using
a current rate of C/20 and a cutoff potential of
0.005 V versus Li.

The collected diffraction patterns were integrated
using the Fit2D
software.43 Rietveld refinement of selected
diffraction patterns was performed using Fullprof suite software.44 The shape of the diffraction peaks was described
by the pseudo-Voigt profile function, whereas the background was refined
using linear interpolation between selected points.
