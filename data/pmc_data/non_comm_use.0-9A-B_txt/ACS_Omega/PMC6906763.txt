The sugary juice from sweet sorghum [Sorghum
bicolor (L.) Moench] stalks can be used to produce
edible syrup, biofuels,
or bio-based chemical feedstock. The current cultivars are highly
susceptible to damage from sugarcane aphids [Melanaphis
sacchari (Zehntner)], but development of new cultivars
is hindered by a lack of rapid analytical methods to screen for juice
quality traits. The mechanism of aphid resistance/tolerance is also
largely unknown, though the importance of defense phytochemicals has
been suggested. The purpose of this study was to develop low-cost
methods sensitive to fluorescent fingerprints in sweet sorghum juice,
which is a complex mixture of saccharides, carboxylates, polyphenols,
and metal ions. Of primary juice components, tryptophan and trans-aconitic acid were the highest intensity contributors
to the overall fluorescence and UV/visible absorbance, respectively,
while tyrosine and polyphenols contributed to a less extent. In a
test of 24 sweet sorghum cultivars, tryptophan and tyrosine contents
were the highest in the aphid-susceptible hybrid N109A x Chinese,
while sucrose, trans-aconitic acid, and polyphenols
were the highest in the resistant line No. 5 Gambela. This suggests
that the accumulation of carboxylate (trans-aconitic
acid) and polyphenolic secondary products in No. 5 Gambela may contribute
to its aphid resistance, thus allowing it to maintain sucrose production.
Rapid detection of these chemical signatures could be used to prescreen
the breeding material for potential resistance and juice quality traits,
without analytical separation required for metabolomics.

1 Introduction
Sweet sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.)
Moench] is traditionally cultivated for the edible syrup made from
the sugary juice that is extracted from its stalks. This juice could
also be used to produce chemical feedstock for the production of biofuels
and other bio-based products. However, the development of improved
sweet sorghum cultivars has been given little attention recently.
The composition and quality of the juice are particularly important,
but there are few methods available to rapidly screen breeding material
for such traits. In addition, the sugarcane aphid [Melanaphis sacchari (Zehntner)] has recently emerged
as a significant pest of sorghum in the United States. All of the
commonly grown sweet cultivars are susceptible and few chemical control
options exist. Thus, resistance to this pest is also of critical importance
in the development of new sweet sorghum cultivars.

Low-cost
spectrophotometric methods could help to expedite plant
breeding by rapidly screening for various chemical traits. Fluorescence
is a promising, rapid, low-cost, yet accurate “omics”
fingerprinting technique for target analytes to address the needs
for “advanced analytics for managing the food and agricultural
system”.1 Naturally occurring fluorescent
molecules are widely used as native tracers to monitor food2 and environmental3 quality, without adding fluorescent dyes.4 Examples of natural fluorophores include aromatic amino acids, riboflavin,
chlorophyll, and vitamin A.2,5 These aromatic molecules
have conjugated double bonds that provide high molar absorption coefficient
and quantum yield.6 However, samples of
agricultural, environmental, and food origins contain a complex mixture
of fluorophores having different characteristic peak positions and
intensities.2,5 As a result, fluorescence peaks
are often visually assigned to “bulk structures” based
on literature comparisons. Examples of commonly observed bulk structures
include “humic-like” and “microbial decomposition
product” in environmental samples5,7 and “fluorescent
oxidation products” and “Maillard reaction products”
for food samples.2 In many cases, such
peak assignments to “bulk structures” are made without
examining the authentic standards for additional possible contributing
structures.

We previously observed tryptophan-like, tyrosine-like,
and “aromatic”
fluorophores in the stalk juice of sweet sorghum.8 The “aromatic” bulk structure was attributable
to electron-donating polyphenols.9 It was
observed that sweet sorghum cultivars with high polyphenolic contents
in the stalk juice sustained less damage from sugarcane aphid.10 The aphid-resistant control, No. 5 Gambela (PI
257599 in Table S1 of Supporting Information),18 was enriched with polyphenols and
also contained a high amount of another secondary product, trans-aconitic acid.10 Collectively,
high polyphenol and trans-aconitic acid concentrations
in phloem sap could serve as defense phytochemicals or phytohormonal
signals upon leaf damage by aphids, as suggested in the literature.11−14 There are different categories of resistance against aphids: antibiosis,
antixenosis, and tolerance.15 Redox-active
(polyphenols) and metal chelating (trans-aconitic
acid) secondary products could play a role in all categories as the
allelochemical (antibiosis), deterrent (antixenosis), and antioxidant
(tolerance).16 Our present study was designed
to examine the direct relationships between these target analytes
(polyphenols and trans-aconitic acid) and host plant
resistance. To achieve this goal with a field-deployable17 spectrophotometric measurement, we first re-examined
the bulk “aromatic” fingerprint by developing sensitive
fluorescence techniques validated by authentic standards.9,19 Results were then used to understand the relationships between the
secondary products and response to sugarcane aphids, where the cultivar
No. 5 Gambela was used as the aphid-resistant control.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Comparison of EEM and Synchronous Spectra
against Authentic Standards
Figure 1 presents solid-phase reflective fluorescence
spectra for authentic standards: as-received pure chemical powders
of model amino acids, carboxylate, and model polyphenol. These structures
were previously observed in sweet sorghum juice.8 The full excitation–emission mode (EEM) scan (left
panels in Figure 1)
is expected to provide detailed spectral features, whereas the synchronous
mode (right panels employing 60 nm delay) enables a shorter time of
analysis affording simpler spectra. Depending on the fluorescence
intensity of a molecule, slit width was varied from 1, 2.5, to 5 nm,
while keeping all other parameters constant. Slit (bandpass) width
affects both the signal-to-noise ratio and resolution of collected
spectra. Larger slit width decreases the noise, while making minor
peaks less visible, and vice versa. Tryptophan had the highest fluorescence
intensity (≈8000 maximum intensity in Figure 1e) at the narrowest EEM slit widths (1 nm).
Oppositely, quercetin required the widest slit widths (5 nm) to achieve
sufficiently high fluorescence intensity (≈500 in Figure 1h). In the EEM mode
(Figure 1a–d),
the characteristic peak position shifted toward higher excitation
and emission wavelengths in the following order: amino acids (tryptophan
and tyrosine), carboxylate (trans-aconitic acid),
to a model polyphenol (quercetin). Such peak shifts (toward higher
EEM wavelengths) are known to occur proportionally to the degree of
conjugation and aromaticity.2,6 Similarly, the primary
synchronous peak (having maximum intensity) of authentic standards
shifted toward longer wavelengths form tyrosine, tryptophan, trans-aconitic acid, to quercetin (Figure 1e–h). In conclusion, synchronous scan
affords a snapshot of characteristic peaks with reduced scan time
compared to EEM. In addition, subsequent statistical separation of
peaks (by PARAFAC to resolve overlapping EEM peaks) is not necessary
for the synchronous mode. Both EEM and synchronous modes showed the
following structure–wavelength relationships of the characteristic
peak positions: aromatic amine < conjugated carboxylate < polyphenol.

Figure 1 Solid-state
reflective fluorescence EEM (left) and synchronous
(60 nm delay, right) spectra of amino acids (a,b,e,f), carboxylate
(c,g), and polyphenolic (d,h) authentic standards.

Based on Figure 1, tryptophan is expected to be the highest intensity
fluorophore
in juice. A sample containing the highest amino acids (Section 2.2) and
low concentrations of other fluorophores (trans-aconitic
acid and phenolics) was selected to identify the protein peaks in Figure 2: N109A x Chinese
planted in April. The synchronous spectrum (Figure 2c) indicates that tryptophan is the primary
fluorophore in this juice sample. Tyrosine has a minor (lower intensity)
contribution relative to tryptophan, and the peak of trans-aconitic acid is outside the wavelength range of juice.

Figure 2 Solution-phase
penetrative fluorescence EEM (a,b,d) and synchronous
(c, 90 nm delay) spectra of diluted (20-fold) juice in protein-rich
cultivar (N109A × Chinese/April) with 2.5 nm EEM slits. This
juice sample has low trans-aconitic acid content
of 3.7 mM. In (b,d), intensities of amino acids were normalized to
match juice. Synchronous spectra of juice samples in penetrative (with
20-fold dilution) and reflective (without dilution) modes are comparable
(Section SII, Supporting Information).

In EEM, there are two peaks at Em wavelengths of
310 and 345 nm
(Figure 2a). For a
direct comparison of EEM peak positions, a 3D plot of juice (red mesh)
is compared with amino acid standards (clear mesh) in Figure 2b,d. The 3D plots indicate
the contributions of both tryptophan and tyrosine. However, because
peaks of two amino acids overlap, their contributions cannot be distinguished
in the 3D plots.

Next, a juice sample with high trans-aconitic
acid content (24 mM without dilution) was investigated in Figure 3: No. 5 Gambela (May
planting). A high emission peak at 430 nm, which was absent in a low trans-aconitic acid cultivar (Figure 2a) is visible in No. 5 Gambela (Figure 3a). In Figure 3b, emission spectra (red lines)
were extracted from the peaks of the EEM contour plot (at 355 and
430 nm emission wavelengths of Figure 3a). trans-Aconitic acid (blue line
in Figure 3b) is the
primary contributor to the 430 nm emission spectrum of No. 5 Gambela
(dashed red line in Figure 3b), where the contributions of amino acids (black and green
lines in Figure 3b)
were negligible.

Figure 3 New peak (430 nm Em) is visible in No. 5 Gambela (May
planting)
cultivar with high (24 mM) trans-aconitic acid content.
Emission spectra of No. 5 Gambela indicates the contribution of trans-aconitic acid (blue line) on the new (430 nm Em) peak
(b). Contributions of tryptophan (green) and tyrosine (black) to the
peak (430 nm Em) are minor in both EEM (b) and synchronous (c) modes.
Instrumental parameters in (c): 2.5 nm slits for juice and trans-aconitic acid, 1 nm slits for tyrosine and tryptophan,
and 60 nm delay time for all authentic standards.

In the synchronous spectra of No. 5 Gambela, longer
delay wavelength
(90 nm, dashed red line in Figure 3c) enhanced the secondary peak at 300–360 nm,
relative to a shorter delay (60 nm, solid red line). Two overlapping
peaks in the synchronous spectrum (red lines in Figure 3c) were resolved into two independent peaks
in the emission spectra extracted from EEM (red lines in Figure 3b). The secondary
peak is enhanced in No. 5 Gambela, relative to the cultivar low in trans-aconitic acid (Figure 2). Subsequent sections will employ the longer (90 nm)
delay time to investigate nonprotein fluorophores observable in the
secondary peak. Overall, EEM is more sensitive to low intensity peaks
(e.g., tyrosine in Figure 2). Synchronous mode offered a higher peak resolution than
the emission spectra extracted from EEM (Figure 3b,c).

2.2 Cultivar Effects on the Chromophores Detectable
by Fluorescence and UV/Visible Spectrophotometry
As observed
in the previous section, visual inspection alone does not distinguish
different fluorophores in a complex mixture of chromophores composing
the sweet sorghum juice. Visual comparison is particularly problematic
for structures with overlapping wavelength ranges, such as tryptophan
and tyrosine. Therefore, the following statistical analyses were undertaken.
First, overlapping EEM peaks were resolved by PARAFAC. Then, fluorophore
concentrations (estimated as the PARAFAC contributions) were evaluated
for cultivar effects (p < 0.05), where three field
replicates were employed to test for reproducibility. Figure 4a–c presents EEM/PARAFAC
fingerprints for diluted (20-fold) juice (2.5 nm EEM slits). Three
fingerprints were attributed to tryptophan-like (Figure 4a), tyrosine-like (Figure 4b), and aromatic
structure (Figure 4c), similar to juice samples from previous years (2015–2016).8,19 The subsequent section will explore the contribution of trans-aconitic acid and polyphenols on the “aromatic”
PARAFAC fingerprint. The concentration of each fluorophore was estimated
as (1) PARAFAC contributions (tryptophan, tyrosine, and aromatic)
and (2) integrated areas of large (250–300 nm primarily attributable
to amino acids) and small (300–350 nm) peaks obtained in the
synchronous mode with 90 nm delay. Cultivar (Table S1 of Supporting Information) and planting month effects
were separately evaluated for these two techniques in Table 1.

Figure 4 Three EEM/PARAFAC fingerprints
obtained for diluted (20-fold, a–c)
juice in the penetration mode, and bagasse powder in the reflective
mode (d–f) from 24 sweet sorghum cultivars in 2017. All spectra
were collected with 2.5 nm EEM slits.

Table 1 shows significant
(p < 0.05) cultivar and planting month effects
on the primary (250–300 nm) and secondary (300–350 nm)
synchronous peaks of diluted (20-fold) juice with 90 nm delay (dashed
red lines in Figures 2c, and 3c). The primary synchronous peak (250–300
nm) attributable to amino acids (Figure 2) showed higher contribution on N109A x Chinese
than N111A x Isidomba or Isidomba and decreased from April to May
planting. The same cultivar and planting effects were observed for
the tryptophan-like PARAFAC fingerprint (Figure 4a) with a lower p value
of cultivar effects (0.002) than the synchronous method (p = 0.008). The minor synchronous peak of juice (300–350 nm)
contributed primarily to No. 5 Gambela and increased from April to
June planting; the same trend was observed for the “aromatic”
PARAFAC fingerprint of juice (Figure 4c) with a lower p value of cultivar
effects [<0.00001 for both absolute and % contributions of juice
3 (aromatic)]. Tyrosine-like maximized in N109A x Chinese, similarly
to the tryptophan-like PARAFAC fingerprint. Collectively, EEM–PARAFAC
was a more sensitive method to classify cultivars (lower p values) and detect fluorophore (tyrosine was distinguished from
tryptophan) than the synchronous method. The sum of absolute contributions
for all PARAFAC factors (1–3) showed a similar cultivar dependence
as tryptophan, which is the highest intensity fluorophore in juice
(Figure 1). When each
fingerprint was normalized to the sum, the cultivar trend indicated
the accumulation of the aromatic fingerprint (juice %3) in No. 5 Gambela
and among the lowest contents of protein fingerprints (%1 and %2)
in No. 5 Gambela.

Figure 4d–f
presents PARAFAC fingerprints for bagasse powder. While mid-EEM (Figure 4d) and least aromatic
(Figure 4f) fingerprints
were previously observed in dry bagasse (2015–2016 samples
with 2.5 nm slits)8 and leaf (2015 samples
with 5 nm slits)10 powder, the 2017 bagasse
sample showed a new high aromaticity fingerprint (Figure 4e). The emission wavelength
of this high aromaticity fingerprint (≈540 nm in Figure 4e) reached that of riboflavin,2 as observed in the 2015–2016 bagasse samples
at higher excitation wavelength (430 nm),8 as opposed in 270 nm in Figure 4e. Therefore, a lower excitation wavelength was required
to achieve the high emission wavelength (540 nm) in 2017 than previous
years (2015–2016). Riboflavin is a highly fluorescent molecule
with excitation maxima at 270, 370, and 450 nm and an emission maximum
at 525–531 nm.2 Riboflavin is a
strong reducing agent and plays a role in the light-induced oxidation
of food (e.g., dairy) products.2 In contrast
to juice, bagasse fluorescence did not differentiate cultivars by
Tukey’s honestly significant difference (HSD) in Table 1. Representative synchronous
spectra of bagasse powder are provided in Section SIII of the Supporting Information. The synchronous peak
of bagasse (obtained at 250–600 nm with 60 nm delay) increased
from April to May planting, similar to the mid-EEM fingerprint of
bagasse PARAFAC (Figure 4d). Normalized (%) contribution of the least aromatic fingerprint
(Figure 4f) increased
from April to June.

To understand the relative contributions
of trans-aconitic acid and polyphenols on the “aromatic”
PARAFAC
fingerprint, Figure 5 presents UV/visible spectra of trans-aconitic acid,
sugars (sucrose, glucose, and fructose), and carboxylates (oxalate,
citrate, and trans-aconitate) previously observed
in sweet sorghum juice.8 Because of high
absorbance, trans-aconitic acid was diluted to 0.1
g/L, while concentrations of other authentic standards were 0.5 g/L
in Figure 5a. Compared
to sugars and other carboxylates, trans-aconitic
acid showed higher absorbance at longer wavelengths (Figure 5a). In Figure 5b, trans-aconitic acid was
directly compared with representative juice containing 5–209
mg/L trans-aconitic acid after dilution (20-fold). Figure 5 indicates an enhanced
255 nm peak as a function of the trans-aconitic acid
content in juice, from N111B/April (5 mg/L trans-aconitic
acid), N110x Atlas/April (24 mg/L), No. 5 Gambela/April (174 mg/L),
to No. 5 Gambela/May (209 mg/L). However, higher absorbance (across
the spectral range) was observed in No. 5 Gambela/May (209 mg/L trans-aconitic acid) and No. 5 Gambela/April (174 mg/L)
than 500 mg/L trans-aconitic acid standard, indicating
contributions from additional chromophores, for example, polyphenols,
in juice. In addition, a higher wavelength peak at 310–350
nm (and baseline shifts toward 400 nm) in those juice samples (red
and green lines in Figure 5b) are not observable in trans-aconitic acid
(cyan line in Figure 5b). Those observations indicate that polyphenolic structures comprise
chromophores in sweet sorghum juice, in addition to trans-aconitic acid, as observed previously.9

Figure 5 UV/visible
spectra of authentic standards (a) and representative
juice samples with varying trans-aconitic acid contents
(b). In (a), concentrations are 0.5 g/L, except for trans-aconitic acid (0.1 g/L). In (b), trans-aconitic
acid concentrations (of 1–20 diluted samples) are given in
parentheses. All spectra are color-coded, and blank-subtracted.

2.3 Cultivar Effects on the Juice Composition
Table 2 shows the
effects of cultivar and planting month on the concentrations of trans-aconitic acid and other organic carbon products. trans-Aconitic acid concentration was significantly higher
in No. 5 Gambela (20.6 ± 1.4 mM as mean ± standard error
across planting months) than all other cultivars (except N109A x Dale
with the second highest concentration of 13.8 ± 1.5 mM), and
the concentration consistently increased toward later planting months.
Similar to trans-aconitic acid, the sucrose content
was the highest in No. 5 Gambela (77.6 ± 7.3 g L–1), Dale (76.9 ± 8.5 g L–1), and Isidomba (57.3
± 6.3 g L–1); later planting increased sucrose
contents. This trend in sucrose contents leads to analogous cultivar
and planting month effects of total sugar (sucrose, glucose, and fructose)
contents in Table 2: highest concentrations in No. 5 Gambela (116.7 ± 9.5 g/L),
Dale (129.3 ± 11.2 g L–1), and Isidomba (103.1
± 8.3 g L–1). Consequently, total organic carbon
(TOC) was the highest in Dale (46.2 ± 4.2 g C L–1) and No. 5 Gambela
(40.6 ± 3.6 g C L–1) and increased for later
plantings. Similar trends for cultivar, planting month, and interactions
(Figure 6a) were observed
for Brix (estimate of g sucrose/100 g solution) in Table 2.

In Table 2, electric
conductivity (EC), pH, and total nitrogen decreased by later planting
month. In addition, EC was the lowest in Isidomba and Dale, which
accumulated among the highest amounts of total sugar in Table 2. The influence of ionic strength
(estimated by EC) and pH on fluorescence intensity is well-described
in the literature.21,22,31 The fluorescence intensity of tryptophan and tyrosine sharply increases
near pKa1 and then decreases near pKa2.22 The ionizable
groups (phenol for tyrosine, indole for tryptophan) of those amino
acids engage in the cation−π interaction with their own
aromatic ring.22 Cation−π interaction (in addition to hydrophobic, hydrogen
bonding, and ion-pair interactions) impacts the protein conformation,
pKa, and fluorescence intensity of aromatic
amino acids.21,23,24 For sweet sorghum juice samples in this study, there was no cultivar-dependent
pH change (Table 2)
to impact the interpretation of fluorescence signatures in Section 2.1.

Figure 6 provides
a detail for the cultivar × planting month interactions observed
for the following variables: Brix, TOC, trans-aconitic
acid, and juice %1 contributions (Tables 1 and 2). Overall, Figure 6 indicates consistently
high trans-aconitic acid concentration, Brix, and
TOC in No. 5 Gambela (and Dale to a lesser extent), regardless of
planting month; other cultivars reached the same level only in the
June planting. For trans-aconitic acid, Brix, and
TOC, significant interactions were observed between cultivars of April
and June plantings (Figure 6a–c). For example, N109A × N98 had among the highest trans-aconitic acid content in June (21.1 ± 2.0 mM)
and accumulated among the lowest concentration in April (2.2 ±
2.0 mM), relative to the 23 other cultivars (Figure 6c). A contrasting interaction trend with
higher p value was observed for the tryptophan-like
PARAFAC contribution (%1 in Figure 6d). Both planting month and cultivar trends for tryptophan
(Figure 6d) were reversed
from the organic carbon variables (Figure 6a–c).

2.4 Possible Relationship between Fluorophores
and Sugarcane Aphid Tolerance
Among the 24 cultivars tested,
No. 5 Gambela sustained the least amount of visible damage from sugarcane
aphids. Dale was found to be more susceptible than No. 5 Gambela but
was still less damaged than most other entries. These two cultivars
were among the highest in juice concentration of trans-aconitic acid. The relative marginal effect of damage, averaged
over all three planting dates, was plotted against the average trans-aconitic acid concentration of stalk juice in Figure 7. This plot reveals
a strong negative correlation (r = −0.873, p < 0.0001) between these two variables. A similar correlation
was observed within the April and May plantings (r = −0.786 and −0.637, respectively) but was not observed
in the June planting (r = −0.085) due to low
aphid infestation in the latest planting (not shown). This suggests
a possible role of trans-aconitic acid in tolerance
to sugarcane aphid, though it is probably not the only factor involved.

Figure 7 Relative
marginal effects of sugarcane aphid damage for each of
24 cultivars averaged across three planting dates (April, May, and
June) at Tifton, GA in 2017 (y-axis) vs average trans-aconitic acid concentration in stalk juice (x-axis).

3 Conclusions
The purpose of fluorescence
technique is to estimate the relative
fraction of target analyte in a large set of samples, without analytical
separation required for metabolomics. Similar peak assignments were
obtained using synchronous and EEM/PARAFAC techniques; however, the
low fluorescent structure, tyrosine, was only observable using EEM/PARAFAC.
Tryptophan had the highest overall contribution (sum of all absolute
PARAFAC contributions) to juice samples because of its highest fluorescence
intensity (Figure 1). Cultivar No. 5 Gambela accumulated the highest amount of a fluorophore
consisting of trans-aconitic acid and polyphenols
(22 ± 1% and 2354 ± 115 absolute contributions of juice
fingerprint 3), which increased as a function of planting month, and
among the lowest amount of protein-like structures (21 ± 1% of
juice fingerprint 2). Cultivar N109A × Chinese accumulated the
tryptophan-like structure with a decreasing trend as a function of
planting month. Higher stem total sugar concentrations at physiological
maturity with later planting (April, May, to June) is consistent with
the 2015 planting year at Tifton due to heavy infestation of sugarcane
aphids in the early plantings.8 The opposite
trend was observed in another study in the absence of aphid infestation,
where higher total sugar was observed in earlier planting from May
to July at various sites in Arizona.29 Although
a correlation does not validate a cause-and-effect relationship, the
highly negative correlation between aphid damage and trans-aconitic acid concentration in the juice could be used as a rapid
chemical sensing technique to prescreen breeding material for potential
resistance along with selection for other juice quality traits.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Field Experiment
The field experiment
was conducted in Tifton, GA in 2017. The experimental design was a
split-plot with three replications, where planting dates (April, May,
and June) were the main plot factor and 24 sweet sorghum cultivars
(Table S1) were randomly assigned to subplots.
Sugarcane aphid damage was rated biweekly on six occasions. Damage
was rated on a scale of 1–9, where 1 represents no damage and
9 represents dead plants, similar to the scale described by Sharma
et al.25 Each subplot was harvested when
it reached the hard-dough stage of maturity (when the stem sugar content
typically peaks). Three representative stalks were harvested from
each subplot, panicles and leaves were removed, and juice was extracted
from the stems by passing twice through a portable three-roller mill
(Sor-Cane Porta-Press, McClune, Reynolds, GA). Juice samples were
immediately frozen after measuring the soluble solids concentration
(Brix) using a digital refractometer (Refracto 30GS, Mettler-Toledo,
Columbus, OH). The bagasse portion was dried to completion at 60 °C,
ground in a Wiley mill (Thomas Scientific, Swedesboro, NJ), and sieved
(<2 mm). Additional details about the field experiment and chemical
analysis of juice samples are given in Section SI of the Supporting Information and were described in
detail previously.8,9,19

4.2 Reflective and Penetrative Fluorophotometry
in EEM and Synchronous Modes
Penetrative fluorophotometry
employs a 90° angle between the excitation light and detector,
and the Beer–Lambert law follows for dilute aqueous samples.2 However, scattering, quenching, and inner-filtering20 become significant enough to violate the Beer–Lambert
law for concentrated, turbid/colloidal liquid samples and for solid
samples.2 For such samples, a front-faced
cell holder is used for the reflective measurement of emission (only
from the sample surface) to minimize the influence of nonfluorescence
disturbance.2,21

Reflective fluorescence
EEM of solid bagasse powder (<2 mm) and selected undiluted, unfiltered
juice samples were obtained using an F-7000 spectrofluorometer (Hitachi,
San Jose, CA) at 220–500 nm excitation and 280–730 nm
emission wavelengths in 3 nm intervals; 2.5 nm excitation and emission
slits; auto response time; and 2400 nm min–1 scan
rate. A solid sample holder was used to allow the light beam irradiation
at 30° and reflection at −60°, along the center line
of the quartz window; this design prevents the reflected light beam
from reaching the light detector.21 An
empty powder sample cell with a quartz window (for bagasse powder)
or distilled, deionized water (DDW) in the front-surface cuvette (for
juice) was used as the blank and was subtracted from each sample to
remove the lower intensity Raman scattering.22 Penetrative spectral collection for diluted (20-fold with DDW) and
filtered (0.45 μm) juice samples used a 10 mm square cell with
DDW as the blank, using the same spectral parameters described above.

Additional EEM regions dominated by Rayleigh and Raman peaks and
the region without fluorescence were removed, and then, parallel factor
(PARAFAC) models26 were constructed with
non-negativity constraint using MATLAB version 8.6.0.267246 (R2015b;
Mathworks, Natick, MA) with PLS toolbox version 8.6.2 (Eigenvector
Research, Manson, WA). As described in detail elsewhere,26 PARAFAC models three-way data (samples, excitation
wavelengths, and emission wavelengths) by minimizing the sum of squares
of the residuals. On the basis of residual/leverage analysis, core
consistency diagnostic scores of 2–7 component models and comparison
with prior reports,8,10 three-component models (core
consistency: 90 for juice, 57 for bagasse) were selected to interpret
the PARAFAC results.

The EEM and synchronous scans27,30 are available
both for the penetrative measurement of dilute aqueous samples and
the reflective measurement of solid samples. The EEM offers detailed
spectral features by scanning the entire emission (Em) wavelength
range for each excitation (Ex) wavelength. A synchronous scan is used
to decrease the measurement time and to improve the resolution of
characteristic spectral bands.27 In the
synchronous scan, Ex and Em wavelengths are simultaneously varied,
while keeping a constant wavelength interval (delay time) between
Ex and Em; luminescence intensity depends on both Ex and Em wavelengths.27 Wavelength scan in the synchronous mode was
conducted for bagasse powder and diluted (20-fold) juice samples without
blank subtraction, using 60 nm (for bagasse; 280 nm emission wavelength)
and 90 nm (for juice; 310 nm emission wavelength) delays at 220–730
nm excitation wavelength; 2.5 nm excitation and emission slits; auto
response time; and 1200 nm min–1 scan speed. Areas
of synchronous peaks were calculated by the trapezoidal integration
at 250–730 nm using OriginPro 2019 (OriginLab, Northampton,
MA).

4.3 Statistical Analysis
For chemical
parameters, the effects of cultivar, planting month, and their interaction
were examined by factorial ANOVA using Statistica version 12 (Statsoft,
Tulsa, OK) at a significance level of p < 0.05.
Type VI sums of squares were used to test the effective hypothesis
for unbalanced observations. If significant differences existed, post
hoc comparisons were conducted using Tukey’s HSD test. Sugarcane
aphid damage ratings were converted to ranks using Proc Sort and Proc
Rank in SAS v. 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC), followed by repeated-measures
ANOVA on the ranks in Proc Mixed, as described by Shah and Madden.28 The obtained midrank values were then converted
to relative marginal effects.28
