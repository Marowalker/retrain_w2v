Growth
of gallium nitride nanowires on etched sapphire and GaN
substrates using binary catalytic alloy were investigated by manipulating
the growth time and precursor-to-substrate distance. The variations
in behavior at different growth conditions were observed using X-ray
diffractometer, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,
cathodoluminescence spectroscopy, optical microscopy, atomic force
microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. It was noticed that,
in respect of both the substrates, when growth time and/or precursor-to-substrate
distance is increased, thickness of the nanowires around the etch
pits remains unaltered, but there is variation in the density of nanowires.
In addition, formation of gallium nitride microwires within the etch
pits was also observed on etched sapphire substrates. Similarly, the
thickness and density of the microwires were found to increase with
increase in growth time and decrease with increase in precursor-to-substrate
distance. The dimensionality scaling of gallium nitride was found
to have a positive effect in improving the luminescence property and
band gap of the grown nanowires. This method of nanowire growth can
be helpful in increasing the probability of multiple reflections in
the materials which makes them a suitable candidate for optoelectronic
devices.

1 Introduction
The
wide direct band gap (Eg = 3.4
eV), quantum confinement, high light extraction/light absorption ability,
and high surface-to-volume ratio makes gallium nitride nanowires (GaN
NWs) a preferable material for numerous opto-electronic and sensing
applications.1−15 Their flexibility toward doping, harsh environments, and growth
on random substrates is also a reason for preferring GaN NWs.16−19

Numerous thin-film deposition techniques such as metal–organic
chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), chemical vapor deposition (CVD),
plasma-enhanced CVD, molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), and hydride vapor
phase epitaxy (HVPE) are being employed for the growth of GaN NWs.20−23 Because of its easiness, CVD serves as the conventionally preferred
technique for the growth of NWs. The general requirements in the CVD
system for the growth of NWs of good quality have been described elsewhere.24

Because of unavailability of native substrates,
GaN is always grown
on non-native or foreign substrates like silicon and sapphire.20−23,25,26 For epitaxial deposition of thin films, it is highly recommended
to have a defect-free substrate and a surface which exhibits a good
crystalline surface quality. Also, the substrates should possess good
mechanical strength with a high melting point so as to withstand high
temperature and harsh environments. Among the substrates, sapphire
is most conventionally preferred because of its hexagonal crystal
structure like GaN and its availability in high crystalline quality
and large area.27,28 Despite these merits, the sapphire
substrate itself suffers from high density of dislocations during
manufacturing processes. If these defective substrates are used for
epitaxial growth of thin films, they tend to decrease the quality
of thin films resulting in degradation of the device performances.29−34

Intensive research has been focused on identification and
reduction
of defects present in the pristine sapphire and MOCVD grown GaN substrates.
Yet, the simplest, economical, and natural way to identify the defects
density is by wet chemical etching at high temperature.35−41 The ability to etch over large area is also a reason for preferring
wet chemical etching. During the etching process, the etch pits are
generated along the dislocation sites present on the surface.

In the present work, the pristine sapphire and GaN substrates were
wet chemically etched using phosphoric acid under optimized conditions.
The GaN NWs were then grown on these etched (sapphire and GaN) substrates.
Numerous reports on synthesis of GaN NWs using the top-down dry etching
process from two-dimensional GaN grown by MOCVD/MBE/HVPE/CVD techniques
on different substrates are available.42,43 However, to
the best of our knowledge, this is the first ever report involving
the growth of GaN NWs on wet chemically etched substrates. This method
of synthesis and experimental conditions has not been reported earlier.
The effect of etch pits in the GaN NW growth under different experimental
conditions is briefly discussed in this work.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Structural Characteristics
The structural
information in respect of the GaN NWs grown by the CVD technique on E′ and E″ was analyzed using
X-ray diffractometer (XRD) as shown in Figure 1. In respect of E′, Figure 1a showcases dominant
diffraction peaks in respect of GaN at (1 0 0), (0 0 2), and (1 0
1) orientations. The other diffraction peaks corresponding to the
catalytic alloy were also identified at (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0),
and (3 1 1) orientations, respectively. Because of the length and
density of NWs, sapphire peaks do not arise.

Figure 1 XRD pattern of GaN NWs
grown on (a) etched sapphire (E′) and (b)
etched GaN (E″) substrates
by varying the growth time and precursor-to-substrate distance.

In respect of E″, the obtained
diffraction
patterns were like that of E′, but there are
no traces of sapphire (Figure 1b). This confirms that there are no diffraction peaks related
to the sapphire substrate, though the MOCVD grown GaN contains sapphire
as the base. Despite over etching [indicated as black arrows in atomic
force microscopy (AFM) images] at some points in etched GaN substrates
(Figure 1b), the sapphire
peaks do not occur because of the length and density of NWs.

The crystallinity of GaN NWs in respect of E″
was better in comparison to that of E′. This
can be attributed to the homo-epitaxial growth in respect of E″ unlike the hetero-epitaxial growth in E′. The indexed peaks in respect of E′ and E″ represent the hexagonal crystal
structure of GaN.

2.2 Surface Characteristics
The surface
composition of the GaN NWs synthesized on E′
and E″ was determined using X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) spectra as shown in Figures 2 and 3. The figures
represent the XPS spectra recorded within a binding energy of 0–1200
eV. The identified peaks represent the core levels corresponding to
gallium (Ga 3d, 3p, 3s, 2p, LMM Auger peaks), nitrogen (N 1s), carbon
(C 1s), and oxygen (O 1s) respectively.44,45 The core levels
representing 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 states of gallium
were identified at ∼1117 and ∼1144 eV, respectively.
The Ga 2p states reveal the existence of predominant Ga–N bonding.
Because of the presence of Ga–Ga metallic bonding on the surface,
a slight shift in peak representing the elemental gallium was observed.
The Ga LMM mode corresponds to the radiation-less transition resulting
from the electrostatic interaction between two electrons in a singly
ionized atom. The N 1s peak at ∼397 eV indicates the presence
of nitrogen contents in the samples. The detection of C 1s at ∼284.5
eV is attributed to the possible extrinsic contamination during sample
testing. The detection of O 1s at ∼532 eV reveals the formation
of Ga–O bonding, arising from the native oxides present within
the CVD reactor as an extrinsic contamination or as an effect of etching.
The residual oxygen present favors the nucleation of GaN and growth
of GaN NWs. The observed surface compositions representing Ga, N,
C, and O corroborate with the energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) maps.

and (e) oxygen.

2.3 Optical Characteristics
The optical
property of the GaN NWs synthesized on E′
and E″ were determined using Raman spectroscopy
and was recorded over a range of 350–750 cm–1 as shown in Figure S1a,b. The peak at
∼420 cm–1 indicates the zone boundary arising
because of the finite size of NWs.46 Two
prominent Raman active peaks corresponding to E2 (high)
and A1 longitudinal optical modes, positioned at ∼568
and ∼725 cm–1, were observed. A shoulder
peak positioned at ∼530 cm–1 was observed
which represents A1 transverse optical mode.45 The peak position of E2 (high) records
a shift due to the stress in the GaN NWs induced during the NW growth.
This can be attributed to the lattice mismatch between sapphire substrate—GaN
NWs–catalyst particle.

2.4 Morphological
Characteristics
The
surface morphology in respect of GaN grown on c-plane
sapphire substrates by the MOCVD technique was observed using AFM
as shown in Figure S2. The figure clearly
emphasizes the formation of wavy growth steps around the sample surface.
The root mean square roughness value of the GaN was estimated to be
0.4 nm.

The morphology of the etched samples was observed using
optical microscopy (OM), AFM, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
In respect of E′, the effect of etching resulted
in the formation of inverted triangular shaped dislocation sites/etch
pits of micrometer size as shown in Figure 4. Upon etching for about 15 min at 300 °C,
randomly distributed etch pits were observed on the sample surface
(Figure 4a). With increase
in time (20 min), sharp, well-defined, and uniformly distributed etch
pits were observed on the sample surface (Figure 4b). On further increase in time (25 min),
macro-sized pits with random distribution and less density were observed
on the sample surface (Figure 4c).

(c) 25 min. The morphologies of the 20 min etched sapphire substrates
have been depicted by: (d) AFM and (e) SEM images. (d) Individual
line profiles of the etch pits.

In respect of E″, the effect of etching
results in the formation of inverted hexagonally shaped etch pits
of micrometer size in a non-uniform manner as shown in Figure 5. Etching for 10 min at 300
°C results in dense and nonuniform distribution of etch pits
on the sample surface (Figure 5a). With further increase in time (15 min), formation of sharp,
well-defined, and densely distributed etch pits was observed (Figure 5b). When the time
is increased to 20 min, macro-sized pits with random distribution
and lesser density were observed on the sample surface (Figure 5c). In addition, there were
regions on the sample surface, where complete etching of GaN layers
was observed (indicated using black arrows). This can be attributed
to the effect of etching temperature leading to the process of over
etching.

using OM for an etch time of (a) 10 min, (b) 15 min, and (c) 20 min.
The morphologies of the 15 min etched GaN substrates have been depicted
by (d) AFM and (e) SEM images. (d) Individual line profiles of the
etch pits.

The formation of etch pits is
based on the Cabrera and Schaarwachter
model of thermodynamics which is attributed to the change in surface
free energy.47 When the substrates containing
dislocations were exposed to etchants at high temperature, Gibbs free
energy on the surface got altered. This resulted in the breaking of
weaker bonds present on the surface, leading to formation of etch
pits.44 To observe the growth of GaN NWs,
samples possessing uniform pit diameters and dense distribution of
pits all over the surface will be more suitable. Taking this into
consideration, the sapphire substrates etched for 20 min (Figure 4b) and GaN substrates
etched for 15 min (Figure 5b) were selected for the growth of GaN NWs. The AFM image
and the line profiles corresponding to E′
and E″ with a scan area of 50 and 20 μm2 are shown in Figures 4d and 5d, respectively. Their corresponding
SEM images with a scan area of 10 μm2 have been depicted
in Figures 4e and 5e.

The catalytic droplet formations and the
initial stage of GaN NWs
growth in respect of E′ and E″ are depicted in Figure 6. In respect of E′, the growth
of NWs was found to originate from both within and outside the etched
regions. Within the pits, the etched regions were found to get filled
with the catalytic droplets during the initial droplet formation,
as an effect of pre-growth annealing process prior to the NW growth.
The NWs were found to grow equally both within the pits and outside
the pits (Figure 6a).
In respect of E″, this phenomenon was quite
different. That is, the formation of NWs was more favorable from the
catalytic droplet around the etch pits as well as along the sidewalls
of the pits. The yellow circles depicted in Figure 6b clearly indicate that the NW growth is
faster along the sidewalls and regions around the etch pits rather
than within the pits. This can be attributed to the variation in the
surface energy as an effect of etching.

Figure 6 Catalytic droplet formation
and origination of GaN NWs grown on
(a) etched sapphire (E′) and (b) etched GaN
(E″) substrates.

It is worth noting that based on the alteration in surface free
energy, growth of GaN NWs on etched sapphire substrates can take place
either around the walls or at the core as suggested by Cabrera and
Schaarwachter,47 or at both the places.44

During the growth of GaN NWs on E′, growth
was observed all over the surface including the etch pits. With increase
in growth time, thickness of the NWs around the etch pit remains unaltered
but the density of NWs gets decreased. At the same time, formation
of GaN microwires (MWs) was also observed within the etch pits (indicated
as red circles in Figure 7a). The thickness and density of the MWs were found to be
time-dependent (Figure 7a–c). This can be ascribed to the increase in the Ga vapor
concentration within the etch pits. As an effect, more and more supply
of reactant species takes place within the pits, thereby contributing
toward the MWs density significantly due to the dominant Gibbs–Thomson
effect.21 When precursor-to-substrate distance
was increased, like the previous case, thickness of the NWs around
the etch pits remained without any change but the NW density varied.
The thickness and density of the MWs was found to decrease with increase
in precursor-to-substrate distance (Figure 7d–f). This can be attributed to the
decrease in the Ga vapor concentration within the etch pits and in
the other regions. As an effect, delay in the supply of reactant species
takes place within the pits, thereby decreasing the MW density significantly
due to the dominant diffusion induced growth mechanism in this growth
regime.21

sapphire substrates representing
(a) sample A, (b) sample B, (c) sample C, (d) sample D, (e) sample
E, and (f) sample F.

During the growth of
GaN NWs on E″, complete
coverage of GaN NWs was noticed on the surface, as well as within
etch pits. With increase in growth time, the density of NWs in and
around the etch pits (indicated as red circles in Figure 8a–c) was found to increase,
whereas no significant changes were observed in the thickness and
length of the NWs. This is attributed to increase in the Ga vapor
concentration with growth time. As an effect, more and more supply
of reactant species takes place, thereby contributing toward NW density
significantly. When the precursor-to-substrate distance is increased,
dense growth of NW was observed around the etch pits. Within the pits,
the density of NWs was found to be dependent on the precursor-to-substrate
distance (Figure 8d–f).
However, no substantial change in the thickness and length of the
NWs was observed. This indicates the decrease in Ga vapor concentration
with increase in precursor-to-substrate distance, leading to delay
in the supply of reactant species, thereby either reducing the growth
rate or limiting the growth process.

Figures S3 and S4 showcase
the high-magnification
SEM images of the GaN NWs grown on E′ and E″, respectively. From the figures, the thicknesses
of the GaN NWs were estimated in respect of E′
and E″ and are tabulated in Table S3. The red circles indicated on the apex of the GaN
NWs grown on E′ and E″
confirm that the growth process is governed by the vapor liquid solid
growth process.48

Figures S5 and S6 showcase the
EDX map containing the elemental distribution of gallium,
nitride, and binary catalyst (gold–palladium) particles grown
on E′ and E″. Other
elemental traces corresponding to carbon and oxygen were also observed
from the EDX maps. Among these elements, traces of carbon can be assumed
to have occurred from the environment as no precursors containing
carbon elements were utilized for the growth of GaN NWs, whereas the
occurrence of oxygen is attributed to the residual oxygen present
in the reactor or due to the effect of etching. The EDX maps corroborate
the XPS data.

2.5 Luminescence Characteristics
The
luminescence in respect of GaN grown on c-plane sapphire
substrates by the MOCVD technique was recorded using photoluminescence
(PL) spectroscopy as shown in Figure S7. The obtained PL spectrum contains two strong peaks at 365 and 500–600
nm. The peak at 365 nm corresponds to the band edge emission (BEE)
of GaN. In addition, the high intense peak of BEE represents the high
crystalline nature of the sample. The peak positioned between 500
and 600 nm can be attributed to the well-known yellow band emission
(YBE) which is observed in wurtzite-type GaN. Whatever be the technique
employed for the growth of GaN, because of the presence of gallium
vacancies, the peak corresponding to YBE can be usually observed.
In addition, the peak corresponding to YBE can also be associated
with deep level emission (DLE).

The luminescence property of
the GaN NWs grown on E′ and E″ is shown in Figure 10. In respect of E′, dominant peaks
representing BEE and DLE of GaN were observed at 340 and 600–800
nm, respectively (Figure 9a). The obtained BEE of GaN NWs was found to red-shift as
an effect of size in comparison to BEE for GaN thin films as reported
already.49 In comparison to cathodoluminescence
(CL) spectra of GaN NWs grown on pristine sapphire (without chemical
etching) available in the literature,22,45 shoulder peaks
were observed at 410 nm for all the samples. The presence of shoulder
peaks can be attributed to either oxygen vacancies or to the effect
of etching. In respect of oxygen vacancies, etching tends to bring
out the dislocations present in the sapphire substrates which exposes
oxygen atoms along the cores as well as on sidewalls of the etch pits,
whereas the BEE of GaN is sensitive to the defect density that arise
as a consequence of etching.44 In addition,
literature suggests that the presence of the shoulder peak could be
attributed to stacking faults in the GaN samples.50 It is to be noted that the intensity of DLE was high in
comparison to GaN NWs grown on pristine sapphire as reported in the
literature,22 clearly indicating the generation
of point defects and vacancies as an effect of etching.

Figure 9 CL spectra
of GaN NWs grown on (a) etched sapphire (E′)
and (b) etched GaN (E″) substrates
by varying the growth time and precursor-to-substrate distance.

In respect of E″, highly
intense BEE and
DLE peaks in comparison to GaN NWs grown on E′
were noticed (Figure 9b). The reason behind the intense BEE is the growth of GaN NWs on
GaN substrates, thereby favoring homo-epitaxial growth. However, shoulder
peaks at 500–600 nm near the DLE were observed. These shoulder
peaks are attributed to the formation of oxy-nitride or oxygen and
nitrogen complexes on the underlying GaN surface as an effect of etching.
This is because etching brings out the dislocations present in the
GaN substrates by replacing the nitrogen atoms with oxygen atoms along
the cores as well as on sidewalls of the etch pits. When the GaN NWs
are grown above them, the oxygen atoms present tend to either form
gallium oxy-nitride or oxygen and nitrogen complexes which results
in the generation of shoulder peaks. The intense DLE is attributed
to the defects generated as an effect of etching. Other reasons could
be the vacancies and point defects.

3 Conclusions
High density GaN NWs with varying length and thickness were grown
on sapphire and GaN substrates using binary catalytic alloy. The synthesized
GaN NWs were found to exhibit a wurtzite crystal structure. The SEM
image manifests the catalytic growth of GaN NWs.

In respect
of E′, NW and MW growth was
observed all over the surface including the etch pits. When the growth
time was increased, thickness of the NWs around the etch pit remains
unaltered but the density of NWs gets decreased. At the same time,
formation of GaN MWs was observed within the etch pits. When the precursor-to-substrate
distance was increased, thickness of the NWs around the etch pits
remained without any change but the NW density varied. In respect
of E″, complete coverage of GaN NWs was noticed
all over the surface, as well as within the etch pits. With increase
in growth time, the density of NWs was found to increase while the
thickness and length of NWs remain without significant change. When
the precursor-to-substrate distance is increased, the density of NWs
decreases without substantial change in the thickness and length of
NWs.

As an effect of etching, shoulder peaks were observed from
the
CL spectra. In respect of E′, shoulder peaks
at 410 nm relating to the dislocations or defects present in the sapphire
substrates due to etching were noticed. In respect of E″, shoulder peaks at 500–600 nm relating to the formation
of oxy-nitride or oxygen and nitrogen complexes were observed as an
effect of etching.

4 Experimental Methods
4.1 Wet Chemical Etching of Sapphire and GaN Substrates
Pristine sapphire substrates (c-plane) and GaN
substrates (GaN grown on c-plane sapphire substrates
by the MOCVD technique were chosen for performing the etching studies.
These samples were named E′ and E″, respectively. The growth conditions and other parameters
employed for the growth of GaN by the MOCVD technique can be found
in Table S1. These samples (E′ and E″) were cut into small pieces
of 1 cm2 size and cleaned ultrasonically for 10 min using
isopropyl alcohol and ethanol, rinsed with de-ionized water, and dried
under N2 ambience. The 85% phosphoric acid (H3PO4) available commercially was used as an etchant. The
substrates were placed in a beaker containing etchant solution. Etching
was carried out at a constant temperature of 300 °C by varying
the etching time as 10, 15, and 20 min (in respect of E′) and 15, 20, and 25 min (in respect of E″), respectively. Post etching, the samples were rinsed with
isopropyl alcohol and deionized water and dried.44,45

4.2 Preparation of the Gold–Palladium (Au–Pd)
Metal Catalyst
A 2 in. gold–palladium (Au–Pd)
target with a metal composition of 60% Au and 40% Pd was directly
purchased from Quoram Technologies. A thin layer of Au–Pd of
10 nm thickness was sputtered on wet chemically etched sapphire (E′) and GaN (E″) substrates
using a sputtering process for 10 min with a plasma current of 10
mA, system pressure of 1.5 × 10–1 mbar, and
distance between the substrate and target of 4.5 cm.44

4.3 Growth of GaN NWs on Etched
Sapphire and GaN
Substrates
Growth of GaN NWs was carried out on these substrates
(E′ and E″) by varying
the growth time (tg) and precursor-to-substrate
distance (Δdist). The growth conditions and other
parameters employed herein are tabulated in Table S2.

The schematic representation of the process is given
in Figure 10.
