Semiconductor photocatalysis under
natural sunlight is an emergent
area in contemporary materials research, which has attracted considerable
attention toward the development of catalysts for environmental remediation
using solar energy. A series of five-layer Aurivillius-phase perovskites,
Bi5ATi4FeO18 (A = Ca, Sr, and Pb),
are synthesized for the first time. Rietveld refinements of the powder
X-ray diffraction data indicated orthorhombic structure for the Aurivillius
phases with Fe largely occupying the central octahedral layer, whereas
the divalent cations (Ca, Sr, and Pb) are statistically distributed
over the cubo-octahedral A-sites of the perovskite. The compounds
with visible-light-absorbing ability (Eg ranging from ∼2.0 to 2.2 eV) not only exhibit excellent collective
photocatalytic degradation of rhodamine B–methylene blue (MB)
and rhodamine B–rhodamine 6G mixture at pH 2 but also show
almost 100% photocatalytic selective degradation of MB from the rhodamine
B–MB mixture at pH 11 under natural solar irradiation. The
selectivity in the alkaline medium is believed to originate from the
combined effect of the photocatalytic degradation of MB by the Aurivillius-phase
perovskites and the photolysis of MB. Although a substantial decrease
in MB adsorption from the mixed dye solution (MB + RhB) together with
slower MB photolysis at the neutral pH makes the selective MB degradation
sluggish, the compounds showed excellent photocatalytic degradation
activity and chemical oxygen demand removal efficacy toward individual
RhB (at pH 2) and MB (at pH 11) under sunlight irradiation. The catalysts
are exceptionally stable and retain good crystallinity even after
five successive cyclic runs without any noticeable loss of activity
in both the acidic and alkaline media. The present work provides an
important insight into the development of layered perovskite photocatalysts
for collective degradation of multiple pollutants and selective removal
of one or multiple pollutants from a mixture. The later idea may open
up new possibilities for recovery/purification of useful chemical
substances from the contaminated medium through selective photocatalysis.

1 Introduction
Utilization
of inexpensive and inexhaustible solar energy for the
degradation of harmful pollutants (environmental remediation) and
production of hydrogen (a source of renewable energy) by the water-splitting
reaction through semiconductor photocatalysis have attracted immense
research interest in recent times.1−5 Improper management of effluents from industries, such as textile,
printing, plastic, cosmetics, coating, paper, and rubber, causes serious
threat to the environment.6,7 Moreover, according
to the World Health Organization (WHO) report, 25% of human health
diseases arise because of the long-term exposure of environmental
pollutants that are present in soil, air, and water. Therefore, neutralization,
degradation, and/or mineralization of harmful pollutants released
from the industries are vital for a cleaner environment and sustainable
living.8−10

Ideally, an efficient visible-light-driven
photocatalyst that harvests
solar energy will have wide-ranging applications not only in environmental
remediation, inclusive of organic pollutant degradation,1,2 water disinfection,9,10 indoor air purification through
volatile organic compound removal,11 and
self-cleaning of surfaces,12−15 but also in the area of renewable energy generation
in the form of hydrogen by water splitting.3−5 Since Fujishima
and Honda’s revolutionary discovery of photoelectrochemical
water decomposition on the TiO2 electrode under UV irradiation
in 1972,16 semiconductor photocatalysis
has become one of the most widely investigated areas for the development
of efficient photocatalysts. Subsequently, different cationic and
anionic substitutions on TiO2 and other oxides of d0 transition metals together with the main group elements have
been extensively investigated for developing newer and better catalysts.17 In this context, exploration of perovskite-based
oxides for photocatalytic energy conversion and environmental remediation
is noteworthy.18 Often, the catalysts are
active only under UV light, whereas for harvesting abundant sunlight,
visible-light activity is essential.

Recently, a lot of attention
has been given to oxides with layered
structures that are active in the visible light, especially to the
Aurivillius family that contains Bi as one of the constituent elements.19−23 The presence of Bi is claimed to be advantageous in two respects.
First, it enhances the likelihood of visible-light absorption by pushing
up the valence band (VB) edge24 because
of the hybridization of Bi 6s with O 2p orbital. Second, the highly
dispersed nature of the Bi 6s–O 2p-hybridized VB results in
the high mobility of the photogenerated holes.25,26 The Aurivillius family of oxides are well-known variants of layered
perovskites that form with a regular intergrowth of fluorite-like
(Bi2O2)2+ layers with the perovskite
(An–1BnO3n+1)2– blocks, where n represents the number of corner connected octahedral layers.
For instance, Bi2WO6 and Bi2MoO6 are classic examples of n = 1 member of
the Aurivillius family, which were studied extensively as visible-light-driven
photocatalysts.27−30 However, because of the lack of higher-order members (n = 2 and 4–5), similar photocatalytic studies are limited.31−33 However, the five-layer (n = 5) Aurivillius phase,
Bi6Ti3Fe2O18, was synthesized
and investigated for its ferroelectric, magnetic, and optical properties.34,35 Additionally, the rare earth (La, Sm, Gd, and Dy)-substituted Bi6Ti3Fe2O18 was explored for
its magnetic and magnetoelectric properties.36,37 Recently, the study on the five-layer Aurivillius phase, Bi6Ti3Fe2O18, investigating
the effect of La substitution on phase formation, structure, and its
consequences on photocatalysis was reported by our group.33 Thus, higher-order Aurivillius-layered perovskites
and their solar photocatalysis constitute an important area for the
exploration of single semiconductor oxide photocatalysts without heterojunction
formation or cocatalyst loading.23,31−33

Although removal of harmful pollutants from wastewaters by
photocatalysis
is widely investigated, most of the studies have focused on the degradation
of a single dye as a pollutant. As the wastewater released from various
industries is contaminated with multiple dyes rather than a single
dye, it is desirable to test the efficiency of a catalyst toward the
collective removal of multiple dyes from a mixture. Therefore, the
study of the collective photocatalytic removal of pollutants from
a mixture is challenging, and such studies are rare in the current
literature. This will be helpful in the development of photocatalysts
active for the treatment of real wastewater disembogued from various
industries into water bodies. Likewise, selective degradation of one
pollutant from a mixture may lead to the development of photocatalytic
processes for the recovery/purification of useful chemical substances
from a contaminated one. Only few reports of selective photocatalytic
oxidation of organic compounds and contaminants with TiO2-based oxides are known in the literature.38−44 The reported photocatalytic selectivity was achieved either by nanostructuring,38 creating mesoporosity,39 acid/base modification,40,42,43 constructing molecular recognition sites,41 or by functionalizing nanosheets.44 However, in all the
above selective photocatalysis reported so far, mostly UV light has
been utilized. Very recently, visible-light-driven selective dye degradation
was reported over hierarchical mesocrystals of AgIn(WO4)2,45 nano CuWO4, and Cu3Mo2O9.46 In another report, selective methylene blue (MB) degradation
over CuFe2O4 nanoparticles was mediated by NaBH4.47 In view of the foregoing and
considering RhB, MB, and Rh6G as model dye systems, we thought it
would be appealing to achieve collective and selective photocatalysis
from the mixture of RhB–MB and RhB–Rh6G under sunlight
irradiation using a single semiconductor photocatalyst.

Here,
a series of five-layer Aurivillius phases, Bi5ATi4FeO18 (A = Ca, Sr, and Pb), are envisaged
by both perovskite A- and B-site cosubstitution through the cationic
charge manipulation of Bi6Ti3Fe2O18. The synthesis, characterization, and pH-mediated collective
and selective solar photocatalytic degradation of RhB–MB–Rh6G
dye systems over the perovskite catalysts are reported. The reasons
for selectivity and enhanced activity are elucidated based on dye
adsorption, zeta-potential, octahedral distortion, and mechanistic
investigations.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Powder X-ray Diffraction (P-XRD) Analysis
The P-XRD
patterns of Bi5ATi4FeO18 (A = Ca,
Sr, and Pb) are shown in Figure 1. A preliminary analysis of the P-XRD data
by comparison with standard JCPDS files reported in the literature
indicated the formation of five-layer Aurivillius phases similar to
Bi6Ti3Fe2O18 (JCPDS PDF
# 21-0101). The unit cell parameters (Table 1) of Bi5ATi4FeO18 (A = Ca, Sr, and Pb) are determined by least-squares refinement
of all the observed diffraction lines in the orthorhombic F2mm (no. 42) space group. A close look
at the lattice parameters of Bi5ATi4FeO18 (A = Ca, Sr, and Pb) series shows an expansion in the c-parameter when A varies from Sr to Pb, whereas a slight
contraction is observed for the Ca analogue as compared to the parent
Bi6Ti3Fe2O18.33

The crystal structure of Bi5ATi4FeO18 (A = Ca, Sr, and Pb) is determined
by Rietveld refinements of the
P-XRD data. The initial model for the structure refinement of Bi5SrTi4FeO18 was constructed using the
atomic coordinates of Bi6Ti3Fe2O18 (F2mm space group) wherein
Fe3+ completely occupies the central octahedral layer and
the remaining octahedral layers are occupied by Ti4+; Sr2+ is distributed statistically over all the Bi3+ sites in the perovskite block keeping the [Bi2O2]2+ layer exclusively occupied by Bi3+. Several
trial refinement runs with other models, where Fe3+ was
statistically distributed over all the perovskite B-sites and Sr2+ over all the perovskite A-sites and [Bi2O2]2+ layers, resulted in higher reliability factors.
The observed, calculated, and difference profiles of the final Rietveld
refinement fit are shown in Figure 2. The refined atomic positions, occupancies, and thermal
parameters are given in Table 2. Figure 3 shows
the structure of Bi5SrTi4FeO18 drawn

6.5%, and χ2 = 1.8.

Similar structure refinements for Bi5CaTi4FeO18 and Bi5PbTi4FeO18 based on the same model structure also gave satisfactory
fits (Figure
S1 in the Supporting Information). However,
because of several free oxygen positions, a simultaneous refinement
of positional and thermal parameters for all the atoms that are in
a general position could not be achieved. Thus, for a good profile
match, the positional parameters were refined one by one in a stepwise
manner, whereas the oxygen thermal parameters were restricted to the
same value for all the oxygens, Bi/Sr and Ti/Fe. To achieve convergence
in the case of Ca analogue, one of the Ti1 coordinates was kept fixed.
However, for more accurate determination of oxygen positions of these
Aurivillius phases, a neutron diffraction study would be necessary.
The refined atomic positions, occupancies, and thermal factors for
Ca and Pb compounds are given in Tables S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information.

2.2 Field
Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy
(FE-SEM), Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS), and Elemental
Mapping Analysis
FE-SEM and the corresponding EDS of Bi5ATi4FeO18 (A = Ca, Sr, and Pb) are shown
in Figure S2 in the Supporting Information. All the compounds show morphological homogeneity of the crystallites
in the entire region of image exhibiting platelike microstructures
though with a fairly large extent of particle aggregation. Moreover,
there is a large variation in the size of crystallites ranging from
several hundred nanometers to few micrometers. Elemental compositions
obtained from EDS at several crystallites of the imaged area show
excellent compositional uniformity and agree with the nominal elemental
compositions. The elemental mapping (Figure 4) carried out in a selected rectangular area
of Bi5ATi4FeO18 (A = Ca, Sr, and
Pb) showed homogeneous and uniform distribution of all the elements
in the compounds.

field image and elemental mapping for Bi5ATi4FeO18 (A = Sr and Pb) in the same order where the third
vertical panel represents the A cations, Sr and Pb, respectively.

2.3 Transmission
Electron Microscopy (TEM) Analysis
The crystalline nature
of Bi5SrTi4FeO18 was confirmed by
TEM and high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) studies.
The HR-TEM image (Figure 5a) clearly revealed the layered intergrowth nature of the
Aurivillius phase consisting of alternating layers of the perovskite
blocks interleaved by [Bi2O2]2+ units.
Moreover, the lattice fringes of 4.925 nm shown in the HR-TEM image
(Figure 5b) agree with
the c-parameter of Bi5SrTi4FeO18. The indexing of few representative spots in the
selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Figure 5c) is consistent with the crystal
system and dhkl’s
assigned by the P-XRD data analysis.

2.4 UV–Vis
Diffuse Reflectance Spectra
(DRS) Analysis
The optical absorption spectra (Figure 6a) of Bi5ATi4FeO18 (A = Ca, Sr, and Pb) show visible-light absorption
by all the compounds with the absorption edges extending beyond 500
nm. There are indeed two characteristic absorptions similar to those
observed for Bi5–xLaxTi3FeO15 (x = 1, 2) and Bi6–xLaxTi3Fe2O18 (x = 0, 1).32,33 The band gap energies of the
compounds are calculated from the Tauc plots (Figure 6b). The best fit for (αhν)1/n versus hν was obtained for n = 2, suggesting probably
an indirect band gap transition, similar to those of Bi5–xLaxTi3FeO15 and Bi6–xLaxTi3Fe2O18.32,33 The estimated band gap energies (Table 1) of the compounds in the range 2.0–2.2
eV are intriguing to explore their potential for sunlight-driven photocatalysis.

and Pb). (b) Corresponding Tauc plots for the calculation

2.5 Photoluminescence
(PL) Analysis
For
comparing the efficacy of the photogenerated charge carrier separation
or the e––h+ recombination in
Bi5ATi4FeO18 (A = Ca, Sr, and Pb),
PL spectra were recorded at an excitation wavelength of 350 nm. A
comparatively lower PL intensity is indicative of relatively slower
or inefficient recombination, thereby suggesting better charge carrier
separation or longer lifetime for the electrons and holes, which in
turn enhances the photocatalytic activity.48 As portrayed in Figure S3 in the Supporting Information, all the compounds show broad PL emission ranging
from 400 to 600 nm with a peak of around 470 nm. However, the differences
in PL intensities are very subtle, which is reflective of the electronic
structure and composition of the compounds. The compositional difference
in the compounds will not affect the frontier band levels as the electronic
states from Ca and Sr are known to be deep inside the VB, thus not
affecting the PL properties largely. According to the PL spectra,
one might expect a higher activity for Bi5SrTi4FeO18, but one need to consider several other factors
to explain the overall activity of the catalysts (see the next section).

2.6 Photocatalytic Activity
The activity
of the compounds, Bi5ATi4FeO18 (A
= Ca, Sr, and Pb), in solar photocatalysis was evaluated by dye removal/degradation
from aqueous solutions taking RhB, MB, and a mixture of RhB–MB
and RhB–Rh6G as model systems. The amount of compounds used
in the degradation was according to our dosage optimization study
(see the Supporting Information and Figure
S4). UV–vis spectral measurements recorded with time during
the degradation of a RhB–MB mixed dye solution show a decrease
in the intensity of the characteristic absorption peaks for the MB
leaving those of the RhB nearly unchanged at pH 7 and 11 (Figures 7a and S5), whereas in the case of the RhB–Rh6G
mixture, the main absorption peak for RhB (Figure 7c) disappears at a faster rate than that
of Rh6G at pH 2 under sunlight irradiation. This indicates a selective
degradation of MB and RhB from the aqueous mixtures of RhB–MB
and RhB–Rh6G, respectively. Interestingly, all the compounds
show selective degradation but up to different extents as a function
of time. Surprisingly, the photostability studies of the dyes at different
pHs show that RhB is stable at all pH (2, 7, and 11), whereas MB appears
to undergo self-degradation/photolysis at neutral (pH 7) and basic
(pH 11) pH under sunlight (Figure S7 in the Supporting Information). Thus, the photodissociation of MB is considered
as a side reaction that occurs parallel to the photocatalytic degradation
of MB at pH 7 and 11. Moreover, the formation of •OH radicals in alkaline (pH 11) MB solution (Figure S8 in the Supporting Information), as proposed in earlier
reports, has been demonstrated by PL studies in the presence of terephthalic
acid (TA) under sunlight irradiation.49 Clearly, the rate of selective MB degradation over Bi5ATi4FeO18 (A = Ca, Sr, and Pb) is faster at
pH 11 as compared to that at pH 7. The enhanced rate of MB degradation
at pH 11 is attributed to the increased rate of photocatalysis by
the semiconductor and photolysis of MB. The inset of Figure 7a shows the selective degradation
through a clear color changeover from purple (for a mixed RhB–MB
solution) to pink (for pure RhB solution). Apparently, Bi5SrTi4FeO18 exhibits complete selective degradation
of MB from the RhB–MB aqueous mixture at pH 11 within 80 min,
whereas Bi5PbTi4FeO18 and Bi5CaTi4FeO18 showed relatively lower activity
(complete MB degradation within 110 and 120 min, respectively, as
shown in Figure S5 of the Supporting Information). The complete and efficient selective degradation of MB from the
RhB–MB mixed dye solution is a significant finding and can
be thought of as solar photocatalytic purification/recovery of RhB
from an admixed MB impurity.

Figure 7 UV–vis absorption spectra showing selective
degradation
of MB from a mixed RhB–MB aqueous solution at pH 11 (a), collective
degradation of RhB–MB (b) and RhB–Rh6G (c) at pH 2 over
Bi5SrTi4FeO18 under sunlight irradiation.
The inset of (a) shows the actual color change during the photocatalytic
degradation of the mixed dye solution with time.

To ascertain the true rate of photocatalysis for the selective
degradation of MB from the mixture of RhB–MB, the corrected
rate for MB degradation is calculated by subtracting the photolysis
part from the total absorbance data of MB degradation (Figure 8). Figure 8a shows ln(C0/C) versus time plots for MB degradation from the
RhB–MB mixture at pH 7 by Bi5SrTi4FeO18, and the degradation rate constants (k)
are 0.0108, 0.0048, and 0.0030 min–1 for total degradation,
photolysis, and photocatalysis, respectively. Similarly, the degradation
rate constants (k) at pH 11 are 0.0409, 0.0072, and
0.0095 min–1, respectively (Figure 8b). As the rate of MB degradation from the
RhB–MB mixture is faster at pH 11 than that at pH 7, the same
is reflected in the rate constants. Noticeably, the rate of photocatalysis
is faster than that of photolysis at pH 11, whereas the reverse is
true at pH 7. Moreover, there is more than three times increase in
the rate of photocatalysis at pH 11, making the MB degradation rapid
and 100% selective over Bi5SrTi4FeO18.

Figure 8 Plot of ln(C0/C) vs
irradiation time showing MB degradation from the RhB–MB mixture
for the total degradation (total), degradation by photolysis (self),
and photocatalytic degradation (corrected) over Bi5SrTi4FeO18 at (a) pH 7 and (b) pH 11.

Interestingly, selective degradation of RhB from
the RhB–Rh6G
aqueous mixture can be envisaged at pH 2 within 40 min of solar irradiation
over Bi5SrTi4FeO18. However, complete
and collective removal of RhB and Rh6G from the mixture is accomplished
in 120 min (Figure 7c). Moreover, complete and collective degradation of the RhB–MB
mixture is also achieved at pH 2 within 160 min of solar irradiation
over Bi5SrTi4FeO18 (Figure 7b). However, in a similar experiment,
Bi5PbTi4FeO18 showed complete degradation
of MB and up to 69% degradation of RhB, whereas the corresponding
Ca analogue exhibited only up to 65% of MB and 40% of RhB degradation
after 180 min of solar irradiation (Figure S6 in the Supporting Information). In the later cases, the λmax of RhB underwent a hypsochromic shift, indicating de-ethylation
of RhB during the degradation.50

Further, to explore the ability of the catalysts in individual
MB and RhB degradation, a series of photocatalytic experiments with
single dye solutions were conducted under sunlight irradiation at
different pHs. The RhB degradation and subsequent % chemical oxygen
demand (COD) removal study (Figure 9) unveiled complete RhB degradation within 30–60
min of sunlight irradiation at pH 2. Moreover, the RhB decoloration
kinetics (Figure 9a)
is more or less concordant with the % COD removal, indicating excellent
dye mineralization. The degradation rate constants (k) (Figure 9b) are
0.085, 0.150, and 0.138 min–1 for Bi5CaTi4FeO18, Bi5SrTi4FeO18, and Bi5PbTi4FeO18, respectively.

degradation of RhB and % COD removal. (b) Plot
of ln(C0/C) as a function
of irradiation time over Bi5ATi4FeO18 (A = Ca, Sr, and Pb) at pH 2.

Despite complete RhB degradation at pH 2, the catalysts did
not
show RhB degradation to any significant extent at pH 7 and pH 11,
indicating negligible photocatalysis in neutral and alkaline media
(Figure S9 in the Supporting Information). On the contrary, the individual MB degradation over Bi5ATi4FeO18 (A = Ca, Sr, and Pb) has revealed
fastest degradation at pH 11, moderate degradation at pH 2, and very
slow degradation at pH 7 (Figure S10 in the Supporting Information). The complete degradation of MB over the catalysts
is observed at pH 11 within 50–60 min of sunlight irradiation,
and the % COD removal indicated excellent dye mineralization ability
(Figure 10a). The
rate constants (k) (Figure 10b) for the total MB degradation at pH 11
are 0.069, 0.113, and 0.077 min–1 for Bi5CaTi4FeO18, Bi5SrTi4FeO18, and Bi5PbTi4FeO18, respectively.
Apparently, these rate constants do not represent the rate for pure
photocatalytic mechanisms because the degradation also proceeds via
photolysis of MB. Moreover, at pH 2, Bi5SrTi4FeO18 and Bi5PbTi4FeO18 showed complete MB degradation within 130–150 min, whereas
Bi5CaTi4FeO18 showed only ∼55%
MB degradation after 180 min of solar irradiation (Figure S10a in
the Supporting Information). At pH 7, only
30, 45, and 37% of MB are degraded (Figure S10b in the Supporting Information) by Bi5CaTi4FeO18, Bi5SrTi4FeO18, and Bi5PbTi4FeO18, respectively,
in 180 min. The rate of photocatalytic degradation for individual
MB and RhB over these layered Aurivillius perovskites follows the
order: Bi5CaTi4FeO18 < Bi5PbTi4FeO18 < Bi5SrTi4FeO18.

COD removal. (b) Plot

2.7 Detection of Reactive Species
To
identify the dominant reactive species responsible for the photocatalytic
degradation of MB and RhB over Bi5SrTi4FeO18, a series of scavenger tests were performed. The photocatalytic
RhB degradation efficiency of Bi5SrTi4FeO18 in the presence of scavengers is shown in Figure 11. The rate of degradation
at pH 2 is substantially reduced on addition of ammonium oxalate (AO,
an h+ scavenger) to the dye–catalyst suspension
as compared to that in the absence of any scavenger. However, a moderate
extent of retardation in the RhB degradation is noticed with the addition
of benzoquinone (BQ, an O2•– scavenger)
to the dye–catalyst suspension and the addition of t-BuOH (•OH scavenger) caused the rate
retardation only to a small extent at this pH. The above findings
are consistent with the fact that h+ and O2•– are active contributors in the photocatalytic
RhB degradation over Bi5SrTi4FeO18 in the acidic medium and •OH plays an assistant
minor role in the degradation. Moreover, the same reactive species
are active for the MB degradation at pH 11 (Figure S11 in the Supporting Information).

scavengers on the degradation of RhB over Bi5SrTi4FeO18 under sunlight irradiation.

2.8 Catalyst Reusability and Stability
The reusability and stability of the catalysts are important parameters
to be assessed for making the semiconductor photocatalysis attractive
and cost-effective for dye wastewater treatment. The photocatalytic
cycle test (Figure 12a) performed over Bi5SrTi4FeO18 (the
best among all the catalysts studied here) for RhB degradation shows
excellent recyclability up to four cycles and only a minor decrease
(∼3%) in the activity during the fifth cycle attributable to
the unavoidable loss of catalysts during recycling. The catalytic
cycle study suggests very good cyclability without any noticeable
loss in the activity of the photocatalysts.

(b) P-XRD patterns of Bi5SrTi4FeO18 recorded before and after
five successive photocatalytic RhB degradations.

The stability of the catalyst is assessed by P-XRD (Figure 12b) and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) analysis (Figure 13) of Bi5SrTi4FeO18 recovered after the cyclic runs. The P-XRD pattern indicated excellent
retention of phase purity and crystallinity signifying no photodecomposition
of the oxide while maintaining its structural integrity during photocatalysis
(Figure 12b). Moreover,
the cycle test for the individual MB degradation also pointed toward
very good recyclability at pH 11 (Figure S12 in the Supporting Information). The postcatalytic P-XRD analysis
of the Ca and Pb analogues also demonstrated good catalyst stability
under the reaction conditions (Figure S13 in the Supporting Information). XPS data of Bi5SrTi4FeO18 recorded before and after the photocatalytic
degradation of RhB–Rh6G (Figure 13) also ascertained excellent chemical stability
of all the elements present in the oxide. Figure 13a–e shows the XPS for Bi 4f, Sr 3d,
Ti 2p, Fe 2p, and O 1s. While the Bi 4f spectra (Figure 13a) consisting of spin–orbit-coupled
doublet in the binding energy range 158.7–158.8 eV for 4f7/2 and 164.0–164.1 eV for 4f5/2 confirmed
the presence of Bi3+, the Fe 2p spectra (Figure 13d) showing the binding energy
of 710.2–710.3 eV for Fe 2p3/2 and of 723.8 eV for
Fe 2p1/2 established the presence of Fe3+ in
the compound both in its pristine form and after photocatalysis.

(e) O 1s of Bi5SrTi4FeO18 before
and after the photocatalytic degradation of the RhB–Rh6G mixture
at pH 2.

Similar spin–orbit-coupled
doublet (3d5/2 and
3d3/2) features are also evident for Sr 3d (Figure 13b) and Ti 2p spectra (Figure 13c). The binding
energy of 457.6–457.8 eV for Ti 2p3/2 states and
463.4–463.6 eV for Ti 2p1/2 states corresponds to
the presence of Ti4+ ions with an additional overlapping
peak at 465.7 eV because of Bi 4d3/2.51 Moreover, the deconvoluted spectra of O 1s (Figure 13e) corroborate well with two
types of hybridized states of O with binding energies ranging between
529.3 and 529.4 and 531.1–531.6 eV corresponding to Bi and
Ti, respectively.

2.9 Mechanism of Photocatalytic
Activity
The adsorption is the first and foremost step in
any heterogeneous
catalytic process and the photocatalytic degradation of dyes is no
exception to this.32,33,52 Therefore, the dye adsorption on the surface of the photocatalyst
is crucial in photocatalysis in addition to other factors such as
creation of electron–hole (e––h+) pairs on photoexcitation and generation of reactive oxygen
species (ROS), followed by oxidative degradation of the dye on the
action of ROS. In most cases, the photogenerated conduction band (CB)
electrons are transferred to the adsorbed oxygens to yield superoxide
radical anions (O2•–) and the
VB holes oxidize adsorbed water molecules to produce •OH radicals, which further take part in the dye degradation. Moreover,
the photogenerated VB holes on the semiconductors may also oxidize
the adsorbed dye molecules into CO2 and H2O.
However, the actual mechanism in a photocatalytic degradation can
be understood based on the relative positioning of the semiconductor
VB and CB potentials with respect to the potentials of •OH/H2O, O2/O2•–, and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)–lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of the degrading molecule.

To explain the photocatalytic mechanism, an energy level diagram
(ELD) is constructed. For this, the relative band edge positions of
the photocatalysts were calculated using the following empirical formulas.53 1   2  

Using the above equations,
the CB and VB positions (ECB and EVB) of Bi5ATi4FeO18 (A = Ca, Sr, and Pb) are calculated
and summarized in Table 3. The potentials for the generation of •OH [E•OH/H2O = +2.68
eV vs normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)] and O2•– radicals and the HOMO–LUMO levels
of RhB (EHOMO = 0.95 eV and ELUMO = −1.42 eV) and MB (EHOMO = 1.76 eV and ELUMO = −0.05
eV) used in the ELD were taken from the literature.54−56

Table 3 Calculated Values of Valence and Conduction
Band Positions of Bi5ATi4FeO18 (A
= Ca, Sr, and Pb)
compound	VB (eV)	CB-1 (eV)	CB-2 (eV)	
Bi5CaTi4FeO18	2.40	0.31	–0.21	
Bi5SrTi4FeO18	2.39	0.27	–0.33	
Bi5PbTi4FeO18	2.52	0.41	–0.14	
According to the ELD (Figure 14), the ECB (2)
of Bi5SrTi4FeO18 (−0.33 eV
vs NHE)
is higher than the O2•– formation
potential (+0.13 eV vs NHE), and the photoinduced electrons in ECB (2) could reduce dissolved oxygens to produce
O2•– radicals. Moreover, the photogenerated
VB holes could get transported to the adsorbed dye and thereby degrade
it, but they would be unable to form •OH radicals
by oxidizing H2O because of their higher VB potential (EVB = +2.39 eV vs NHE) than the corresponding E•OH/H2O (+2.68
eV vs NHE). The above proposition from the ELD is in conformity with
the scavenger test results, indicating O2•– and h+ as the major reactive species that actively participate
in the MB and RhB degradation. It is worth mentioning that the electrons
at the LUMO of RhB are in a favorable position to photosensitize the
semiconductor for its degradation, whereas that of MB cannot. However,
the reason for selectivity cannot be ascertained based on the above
mechanism.

and the HOMO–LUMO levels

2.10 Role of Adsorption and ζ-Potential
On the basis of our earlier reports,32 dye adsorption being a crucial factor for enhanced photocatalysis,
it was intriguing to investigate into the photocatalytic selectivity
based on adsorption. Interestingly, the adsorption results (Figure 15) in mixed dye
solutions indicated selective adsorption of MB in neutral and alkaline
media for all the catalysts. However, it shows both MB and RhB adsorption
to comparable extents in the acidic medium. The maximum adsorption
of MB took place in the alkaline medium for all the catalysts. These
results are consistent with selective degradation of MB in neutral
and alkaline media but collective dye degradation (both MB and RhB)
in the acidic medium. A faster selective degradation of MB in the
alkaline medium can be attributed to its superior adsorption at pH
11, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic degradation in addition to
its base-catalyzed photolysis. Moreover, the photocatalytic activity
toward individual dyes also follows the adsorption order (Figure S14
in the Supporting Information), making
Bi5SrTi4FeO18 as the most active
catalyst, and the activity decreases in the order: Bi5SrTi4FeO18 > Bi5PbTi4FeO18 > Bi5CaTi4FeO18.

Figure 15 Influence
of pH on the preferential adsorption of dye from aqueous
mixtures of MB and RhB on (a) Bi5CaTi4FeO18, (b) Bi5SrTi4FeO18, and
(c) Bi5PbTi4FeO18. (d) ζ-potential
of Bi5ATi4FeO18 (A = Ca, Sr, and
Pb) catalysts at different pHs.

The catalyst surface charge plays a vital role in the dye
adsorption
process. Therefore, to probe the surface charge of the catalysts,
the ζ-potentials were measured at different pHs. The highest
negative ζ-potentials are observed at pH 13 (Figure 15d). As the pH is decreased,
the ζ-potential decreases from more negative potentials to less
negative potentials, and finally, it becomes positive in the acidic
medium. This trend is mostly due to the action of H+ and
OH– ions on the surface hydroxyl groups of the oxide.32

Interestingly, the ζ-potential of
the catalysts is mirrored
in the selective dye adsorption. At pH 11, the highest selective MB
adsorption takes place on Bi5SrTi4FeO18, which has the highest negative ζ-potential (−55.1
mV) as compared to Bi5PbTi4FeO18 and
Bi5CaTi4FeO18, with ζ-potentials
of −50.1 and −48.2 mV, respectively. Moreover, the selective
MB adsorption to a moderate extent is also noticed at pH 7. This has
also been attributed to the negative ζ-potentials of the catalysts
at this pH. The pronounced adsorption of MB in neutral and alkaline
media is believed to be due to the electrostatic attraction of negatively
charged catalyst surfaces with the cationic MB molecules, whereas
a negligible adsorption of RhB is attributed to the electrostatic
repulsion between the negatively charged carboxylic acid groups of
RhB with the negatively charged catalyst surface. Being zwitterionic
in nature, an electrostatic attraction of the positively charged N,N-diethyl end of RhB with the negatively
charged surface may also be considered, but it will not result in
any favorable adsorption.32 However, it
is interesting to observe that all the compounds reported here show
adsorption of MB, RhB, and Rh6G in the acidic medium (Figure S14 in
the Supporting Information). The higher
adsorption of RhB in the acidic medium from the RhB–Rh6G mixture
can be understood from previous reports,32 whereas a lower adsorption of Rh6G can be attributed to the weaker
electrostatic attraction because of the presence of the bulky −OC2H5 group in place of the carboxylate (see Figure
S15 in the Supporting Information). The
highest adsorption of RhB and MB takes place over Bi5SrTi4FeO18, which acquires the most positive ζ-potential
(+39.7 mV) among the catalysts at pH 2. The ζ-potentials for
Bi5PbTi4FeO18 and Bi5CaTi4FeO18 are +34.1 and +29.8 mV, respectively. Although
the adsorption of MB (a cationic dye) at pH 2 appears unusual on a
positively charged catalyst surface, it may probably be due to the
favorable electrostatic interaction of the lone pair of nitrogen-rich
moieties (basic) with the surface hydroxyl protons (acidic) of the
catalyst.

The rate of individual MB degradation is faster than
that of selective
degradation in the presence of RhB at pH 11. It is evident from the
ELD that the energy level positioning of RhB is suitable for the dye
sensitization mechanism to be operative in these catalysts and expected
to enhance the rate of degradation. This apparent contradiction, however,
supports the adsorption-based mechanism where the principle route
to degradation is through h+ transfer from the semiconductor
VB
to the adsorbed dye molecule. The zeta-potential-mediated adsorption
selectivity results in an enhanced MB adsorption at pH 11, whereas
the RhB adsorption is almost negligible, thus making the photosensitization
by electron transfer from RhB to the semiconductor CB insignificant.
On the other hand, RhB, being a strong absorber of the visible light
and having an overlap of its absorption band with the band edge of
the semiconductors, only allows a part of the incident light for semiconductor
excitation in addition to reducing it gradually up to the bottom of
the dye–catalyst suspension to a considerable extent. It is
believed that this combined effect makes the selective MB degradation
rate slower as compared to that of the individual dye at pH 11. Moreover,
it is concluded that the near 100% selectivity of MB degradation in
the presence of RhB at pH 11 is not only due to its preferential adsorption
but also due to an h+-specific degradation pathway together
with its base-catalyzed photolysis. Otherwise, both dyes would have
degraded to significant extents in the alkaline media, had the generated
ROS (O2•– and •OH) instead of h+ been the dominant species for degradation.

Last, a correlation of crystal chemistry of the Aurivillius phases
with their catalytic activity is in order. All the compounds under
discussion crystallize in a noncentrosymmetric space group (F2mm) belonging to a polar crystal class.
The crystal structure is likely to influence their electric polarization
properties, which in turn would influence the catalyst surface charge.
To analyze and understand any role of crystal structure on the varied
extent of adsorption and photocatalytic activity, the octahedral distortion
parameter57 (Δo) for the
Ti/FeO6 octahedra of all the compounds is calculated (Figure
S16 and Table S3 in the Supporting Information). The calculated Δo values for the terminal octahedra
differ to a considerable extent from Ca, Sr, to Pb analogues having
the highest Δo of 0.011 for the Ca compound and smaller
Δo values of 0.005 and 0.008 for Pb and Sr, respectively.
Moreover, the Δo values gradually decrease in the
order: terminal > preterminal > central octahedra for any given
compound.
This is consistent with the second-order Jahn–Teller (SOJT)
distortion58,59 trends observed in other series
of layered perovskites, where the terminal layer is distorted to the
highest extent and it gradually decreases as one proceeds toward the
central layer. It is found that the activity order is not consistent
with the order of the calculated Δo values. To have
further insights into the nature of Aurivillius perovskite surfaces
and effects of local octahedral distortion on the adsorption phenomena,
the axial distortion parameters (Δax) for the octahedra
are calculated considering only the distortion of the axial bonds
arising out of the SOJT effect. The axial distortion parameter is
defined as , where li are axial bond lengths parallel
to the crystallographic c-axis and l® is
the average bond length of the octahedra. Interestingly, the variation
of Δax across the octahedral layers for any given
compound also follows the order of distortion similar to Δo, being highest for the terminal and lowest in the central
octahedral layer. Moreover, the Δax for the terminal
octahedral layer of the Sr analogue is the highest and decreases in
the order: Sr > Pb > Ca (see Table S3 in the Supporting Information). This is mirrored in the order of catalyst surface
charge (Figure 15d),
dye adsorption, and subsequently in the photocatalytic activity. A
clear trend of enhanced surface charge with increasing Δax values seems to imply that the adsorption-mediated photocatalytic
activity order is a manifestation of the associated SOJT effect and
consequent electric polarization properties arising at the terminal
octahedra that constitute the surface of perovskite catalysts. The
crystal chemical correlation can be adapted in the catalytic activity
enhancement by designing oxides with increased axial octahedral distortion
in a homologous series wherein the frontier band structure and PL
properties largely remain unaffected because of compositional modifications
at the A-sites of the perovskites mainly by alkali and alkaline earth
metals.

3 Conclusions
Bi5ATi4FeO18 (A = Ca, Sr, and
Pb), a new series of five-layer Aurivillius perovskites, was synthesized
and reported for the first time. All the compounds crystallized in
an orthorhombic structure with Fe largely occupying the central octahedral
perovskite layer. The compounds have shown excellent selective solar
photocatalysis in MB degradation from an aqueous RhB–MB mixture
at pH 11. While the rate of selective MB degradation decreased at
pH 7, the catalysts showed collective degradation of MB and RhB at
pH 2. The photocatalytic activity studies established Bi5SrTi4FeO18 as the most active catalyst among
all the Aurivillius oxides reported here. Scavenger tests with Bi5SrTi4FeO18 indicated h+ and
O2•– as the major reactive species
contributing toward photocatalytic RhB and MB degradations. The empirical
ELD is supportive of the h+- and O2•–-mediated photocatalytic dye degradations. The photocatalytic cycle
tests and postcatalytic P-XRD analysis confirmed the cyclability and
excellent stability of the catalysts in a wide pH range. The enhanced
photocatalytic activity of Bi5SrTi4FeO18 as compared to that of the Ca and Pb analogues corroborated well
with an enhanced dye adsorption that occurred possibly due to an enhanced
electric polarization arising out of axial octahedral distortion of
SOJT origin. The selective solar photocatalysis demonstrated here
is appealing for the development of new catalysts that are selective
and harvest solar light for environmental remediation purposes. This
may also unlock new possibilities for recovery or purification of
precious dyes and chemicals from a mixed solution of pollutants, wastes,
and byproduct mixture through selective solar photocatalysis. Moreover,
the role of axial octahedral distortion (Δax) may
work as an indicator for the tolerance factor-based cationic and anionic
manipulations for the exploration of a large number of photocatalysts
in homologous series and better design of improved catalytic systems
based on structural principles.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials and Synthesis
Bi2O3 (≥98%), CaCO3 (≥99%), SrCO3 (≥99.9%), PbO (≥99%), TiO2 (99.8%),
and FeC2O4·2H2O (99%) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. The other reagents employed
in our experiments were of analytical grade and used without any further
purification. All the dye solutions were freshly prepared before the
experiments in Millipore (Bedford, MA, USA) water.

Polycrystalline
samples of Bi5ATi4FeO18 (A = Ca,
Sr, and Pb) were prepared by solid-state reactions. For this, stoichiometric
quantities of Bi2O3, ACO3 (A = Ca
and Sr)/PbO, TiO2, and FeC2O4·2H2O were thoroughly ground in an agate mortar for 1 h and heated
at 780 °C for 2 h. Afterward, the powders obtained after initial
heating were reground, pelletized, and heated at 1000 °C for
2 h.

4.2 Characterization
The progress of
the reaction and phase purity of the resulting products were monitored
by P-XRD recorded on a Bruker AXS D8 ADVANCE diffractometer using
graphite monochromatized Cu Kα (λ = 1.5406 Å) radiation
in the range 5° ≤ 2θ ≤ 90° with a step
size of 0.018°. Unit cell parameters of the samples were least-squares
refined using the PROSZKI program.60 Rietveld
refinement of the P-XRD data for Bi5ATi4FeO18 (A = Ca, Sr, and Pb) was carried out using the FullProf
program suite.61 For refinements, the P-XRD
data were collected in the 10–90° angular range at 40
kV and 30 mA with a data collection time of 6 h and a step size of
0.018°. In the initial refinement runs, the background coefficients
along with zero-shift and cell parameters were refined. In the subsequent
runs, the profile and shape parameters were refined. In case, where
the program diverged, the profile and shape parameters were refined
one by one. The positional and thermal parameters were refined in
the later stages of the refinement by systematically starting with
heavier atoms first and then subsequently moving to those of the lighter
atoms. Moreover, to avoid divergence, the thermal parameters of oxygens
were fixed to the value reported for the model system.62 Finally, the cation disorder was examined by
using the refined position and thermal parameters and refining the
varying occupancy of the atoms.

Microstructural studies of the
as-prepared compounds were carried out using FE-SEM (Zeiss FE-SEM,
Ultra Plus 55), operating at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. Qualitative
and quantitative elemental analysis and elemental mapping of the compounds
were carried out using an EDS facility (Oxford Instruments) attached
with the FE-SEM instrument. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
images and SAED patterns were recorded with a FEI TECNAI G2 microscope, operated at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV.

UV–vis DRS were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2450 UV–vis
spectrophotometer in the 200–800 nm wavelength range using
BaSO4 as a reference material. The band gap of the semiconductors
was estimated employing standard procedures and equations63−65 as described in the Supporting Information.

The PL spectra of the compounds were recorded in a Shimadzu
RF-5301PC
spectrofluorophotometer in the wavelength range of 400–650
nm with an excitation wavelength of 350 nm. The surface charge of
the semiconductor catalyst particles was measured on Zetasizer Nano
ZS90 from Malvern Instruments, UK, in water suspensions of appropriate
pH.

XPS analysis was carried out using a Physical Electronics PHI
5000 VersaProbe III spectrometer (Physical Electronics) using Al Kα
radiation (1486.6 eV).

4.3 Adsorption Test
Adsorption tests
were carried out for individual RhB, MB, and Rh6G (at pH 2) solutions
together with a mixed solution of RhB and MB at different pHs in the
dark. For this, 50 mg of Bi5ATi4FeO18 (A = Ca, Sr, and Pb) (as the adsorbent) was dispersed in 50 mL of
1 × 10–5 M dye solution at appropriate pH (2,
7, and 11). For the mixed dye adsorption experiment, 25 mL each of
RhB and MB of 2 × 10–5 M concentration was
mixed to maintain the same catalyst to the individual dye concentration.
After stirring at 350 rpm for 6 h in the dark, the suspensions were
centrifuged and a portion of the centrifugate was used for absorption
measurements on a Shimadzu 2450 UV–vis spectrophotometer. The
percentage of dye adsorption was calculated using the following expression. 3  where C is the concentration
of the dye after 6 h stirring and C0 is
the initial dye concentration.

4.4 Photocatalysis
The photocatalytic
dye degradation studies were carried out with individual RhB, MB,
and a mixture of RhB–Rh6G (at pH 2) and RhB–MB under
sunlight irradiation at different pHs (2, 7, and 11). All the photocatalytic
experiments were carried out at IIT Roorkee (29°51′ N;
77°53′ E) under similar conditions in the month of October–November
under full sunlight irradiation (solar direct normal irradiance ≈216–142
W/m2). For this, 0.1 g of the catalysts (optimized by the
dosage test, see the Supporting Information), Bi5ATi4FeO18 (A = Ca, Sr, and
Pb), was suspended in 100 mL of 1 × 10–5 M
dye solution of appropriate pH. Prior to irradiation, the catalyst–dye
suspensions were magnetically stirred for 1 h in the dark to ensure
the establishment of adsorption–desorption equilibrium between
the catalyst and dye molecules. For monitoring the dye degradation
with time, an aliquot (∼3 mL) from the dye–catalyst
suspension was periodically sampled and centrifuged at 8200 rpm (to
remove the catalyst particles) for absorbance measurements on a Shimadzu
2450 UV–vis spectrophotometer. A blank control experiment was
always performed using the same dye solution under study in the absence
of catalysts in an identical experimental condition.

The photocatalytic
degradation kinetics over Bi5ATi4FeO18 (A = Ca, Sr, and Pb) were fitted with the Langmuir–Hinshelwood
model 4  where C0 is the
initial dye concentration, C is the concentration
of dye at time t, and k is the rate
constant. The linearity of ln(C0/C) versus irradiation time plots affirmed the pseudo-first-order
nature for the kinetics of dye degradation reported here. Photocatalytic
cycle tests were performed using the same procedures as described
in our earlier studies.32

4.5 Analysis of Reactive Species
To understand
the role of the reactive species for the degradation of RhB or MB
over Bi5SrTi4FeO18 under sunlight
irradiation, appropriate scavengers were added into the RhB or MB
solution, and the degradation experiments were carried out in a similar
fashion to those described in photocatalysis studies. In these experiments,
AO, BQ, and tertiary butyl alcohol (t-BuOH) were
used as scavengers for holes (h+), superoxide radical anions
(O2•–), and hydroxyl radicals
(•OH), respectively.

To confirm the generation
of hydroxyl radicals (•OH) in MB dye solution at
pH 11 under sunlight irradiation, PL experiments were carried out
using TA as a probe molecule. For this, 0.0083 g of TA powder was
dissolved in 100 mL of 10–5 M aqueous MB solution
of pH 11 (adjusted with NaOH), and the solution was magnetically stirred
in the dark for 60 min before irradiating it to the sunlight. The
PL spectra were recorded on aliquots withdrawn at regular time intervals
by a fluorescence spectrophotometer at an excitation wavelength of
315 nm. Similar experiment was also performed in the dark as a reference
blank test.

4.6 COD Test
Mineralization
of the dyes
during and after photocatalysis was monitored by using a digestion
unit (DRB 200, HACH, USA) and a UV–visible spectrophotometer.
For this, multiple degradation experiments were carried out with the
same set of dyes and catalysts. The dye–catalyst suspensions
were exposed to sunlight for different time intervals, and the aliquots
were collected for COD analysis. The photodegradation efficiency was
calculated by using the following equation. 5
