High
concentration of dissolved phosphate ions is the main responsible
factor for eutrophication of natural water bodies. Therefore, detection
of phosphate ions is essential for evaluating water eutrophication.
There is a need at large-scale production of real-time monitoring
technology to detect phosphorus accurately. In this study, facile
enzymeless phosphate ion detection is reported using a nozzle-jet-printed
silver/reduced graphene oxide (Ag/rGO) composite-based field-effect
transistor sensor on flexible and disposable polymer substrates. The
sensor exhibits promising results in low concentration as well as
real-time phosphate ion detection. The sensor shows excellent performance
with a wide linear range of 0.005–6.00 mM, high sensitivity
of 62.2 μA/cm2/mM, and low detection limit of 0.2
μM. This facile combined technology readily facilitates the
phosphate ion detection with high performance, long-term stability,
excellent reproducibility, and good selectivity in the presence of
other interfering anions. The sensor fabrication method and phosphate
detection technique yield low-cost, user-friendly sensing devices
with less analyte consumption, which are easy to fabricate on polymer
substrates on a large scale. Besides, the sensor has the capability
to sense phosphate ions in real water samples, which makes it applicable
in environmental monitoring.

==== Body
Introduction
Phosphorus is an essential
macronutrient element, utilized by all
living organisms for growth as well as for energy transport.1 It often acts as a limiting nutrient in terrestrial
and aquatic ecosystems for primary production.2−4 Phosphorus,
in the form of phosphate, plays an important role in photosynthesis,
marine carbon cycle, and aerial carbon dioxide sequestration.5 High levels of phosphorus in water systems can
cause water eutrophication where growth of alga and planktons increases,
causing algal bloom.6 The eutrophication
leads to the reduction or elimination of dissolved oxygen, which is
extremely essential for aquatic living organisms. Some algal blooms
release harmful toxins, which can badly affect human beings who consume
this contaminated water or its products.7−12 Hence, for the economical environmental protection, it is very crucial
to use sensitive, selective, low-cost, online, and facile-technology-based
phosphorus sensors featuring high accuracy to monitor phosphate levels
in aquatic systems.

Significant efforts have been made to fabricate
sensors for the
development of phosphate-selective electrodes using several electroanalytical
techniques.13−20 Several optical methods including fluorescence and luminescence
methods have been reported to detect orthophosphates with an accuracy
of up to ∼0.01 mg/L only.21−25 Although these methods express high limit of detection
(LOD), they are still considered to be very tedious approaches. In
the past, electrochemical amperometric sensors comprised of Ni, carbon
black, and Co electrodes have been developed for phosphate detection.26−30 Although the electrochemical method shows promising results, it
suffers from some drawbacks such as low stability, electrode fabrication,
and need of a reactive surface for phosphate ion detection. The ion
selective electrode (ISE) method or the potentiometric sensor method
is also reported for orthophosphate detection, and considerable efforts
have been directed toward electrode membrane development.31−34 The ISE method also suffers from limitations such as the limited
lifetime of the membrane and high LOD. Recently, field-effect transistor
(FET)-based sensors have attracted great interest in the sensing community
due to their better performance and facile technology.35−48 In a typical FET sensor, the source, drain, and channel electrodes
work in combination to sense the target molecules by monitoring the
electrical conductance change in the channel material. The channel
material is so significant in FET sensor applications that its electronic
properties and interaction with the adsorbed analyte strongly affect
sensitivity. Graphene- and reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-based nanostructures
exhibit excellent electronic properties and have been therefore used
for several applications.49−51 Recent graphene FET sensors for
chemical sensing (including nitrate ions) have been explored with
a better output.52−54 Chen et al. reported a label-free micropatterned
rGO film FET sensor that can detect selectively Cd2+ and
Hg2+ ions in a real-time fashion.55 Ikhsan et al. reported a facile synthesis of a graphene oxide–silver
nanocomposite and its modified electrode for enhanced electrochemical
detection of nitrite ions.56 Recently,
Mao et al. reported ultrasensitive rGO nanosheets and a ferritin-probe-based
field-effect transistor sensor for the detection of orthophosphate
ions with a detection limit of ∼0.026 μM.57 However, most of the approaches use either very
complicated techniques or polymeric additives to attach nanostructures
and active probe materials on the electrode surfaces. Overall, a facile
and cost-effective fabrication technique like nozzle-jet printing
is required to fabricate highly reproducible sensors on large scale
with excellent sensing performances.58−60 From the last decade,
the use of ink-jet printing technology has emerged as one of the powerful
patterning tools for manufacturing electronic devices. The nozzle-jet
printing method is just a simpler and modified form of ink-jet printing
technique. This method can be used to print various kinds of materials
such as Ag NPs, ZnO NPs, and NiO NPs.60,61

Herein,
we reported nozzle-jet-printed Ag/rGO-composite-based enzymeless
FET sensors on poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) substrates to detect
phosphate ions.

The nozzle-jet printing method was used in this
work preferably
due to its facile operation, environmental friendliness, and compatibility
with inks of different viscosities. The printed active Ag/rGO channel
materials were well characterized using field-emission scanning electron
microscopy (FESEM, Hitachi S4700), atomic force microscopy (AFM),
X-ray diffraction (XRD), elemental mapping, and energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) for their various properties. The FET sensor
shows remarkable results for phosphate ion detection in low concentration
range and with high sensitivity in a short time. The sensor also exhibits
high selectivity toward phosphate ions and relatively low responses
to TTP, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, HCO3–, and SO42– interfering
ions. The reproducibility as well as the long-term stability of the
sensor device was also confirmed. The outstanding performance of nozzle-jet-printed
Ag/rGO-based enzymeless FET sensors promises a large-scale industrial
fabrication technology for phosphate ion monitoring in water systems.

Results
and Discussion
Figure 1 shows the
FESEM images of the interfacial area between the nozzle-jet-printed
Ag electrode and the Ag/rGO channel, low- and high-resolution nozzle-jet-printed
Ag/rGO channels having a surface area of 0.05 cm2 (width
∼0.1 cm and length ∼0.5 cm), and as-printed Ag source/drain
electrodes. FESEM images clearly reveal the smooth and easily distinguishable
as-printed Ag electrode and Ag/rGO composite channel separately. The
two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) AFM images of the
nozzle-jet-printed Ag and Ag/rGO channel are shown in Figure 2a–d. It can be observed
from both 2D and 3D AFM images that the roughness and particles size
of the Ag/rGO composite are greater than those of the as-printed Ag
electrode. This observation is supported by the root-mean-square roughness
values of the as-printed Ag electrode (∼35 nm) and the Ag/rGO
printed composite channel (∼54 nm). Figure 2e exhibits the 2D surface profile analysis
of both the nozzle-jet-printed Ag and Ag/rGO channel with the former
showing a thickness of ∼1.2 μm and the later of ∼1
μm. Figure 3a
shows XRD patterns of the pure rGO powder and nozzle-jet-printed Ag
and Ag/rGO channel. A weak broad-band peak at 2θ = 24.05°
is observed, which is attributed to the (002) diffraction plane of
rGO. Its peak intensity indicates the degree of graphitization of
the rGO.62 In addition, the nozzle-jet-printed
Ag/rGO composite shows five diffraction peaks, which are attributed
to the (111), (200), (220), (311), and (331) planes of Ag NPs with
a face-centered cubic structure. Figure 3b demonstrates EDX of the nozzle-jet-printed
Ag/rGO channel, confirming the presence of all of the three elements,
i.e., carbon, oxygen, and silver, of the composite material. The purity
and distribution of the as-printed Ag/rGO channel are further supported
by its elemental mapping, as represented in Figure 3c–f.

The electrical properties (Ids–Vds) of the Ag/rGO-based FET
sensor were investigated
before performing the actual phosphate ion detection as shown in Figure S1 (Supporting Information). The results
clearly show an Ohmic contact between Ag electrodes and the Ag/rGO
channel. Therefore, it can be considered that Ag/rGO is effectively
printed between Ag electrodes without any deterioration in electrical
contact and conductivity. The electrocatalytic properties of the nozzle-jet-printed
Ag/rGO FET sensor were determined in 0.1 M N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) buffer (pH 7.5) without
and with 1 mM phosphate (Figure 4a). There was a substantial increase in the current
response, with Ag/rGO showing a higher response than bare rGO, in
the presence of phosphate ions. It has been reported earlier that
the Ag/rGO composite demonstrates a synergetic catalytic property.62 The change in drain current is entirely due
to the conductivity and catalytic property of the Ag/rGO composite
material in the presence of phosphate ions. The Ag NPs contribute
to enhancing the drain current of the Ag/rGO film, which could be
attributed to the lower work function of Ag NPs (4.2 eV) than that
of rGO (4.65 eV). This leads to the formation of Ag+ ions,
which, in turn, act as an active site for PO4– ion adsorption. The increased drain current can therefore be due
to the redox reaction occurring at the surface of the sensor. Different
concentrations of phosphate ion solutions were prepared in 0.1 M HEPES
buffer (pH 7.5) to study the working performance of Ag/rGO FET sensor
devices. Figure 4b
shows the I–V response of
the Ag/rGO FET sensor device toward different concentrations of phosphate
ions. There was no current leakage observed when FET was exposed to
phosphate solution. It was observed that the drain current increased
gradually with phosphate ion concentration. The current changes noticeably
for phosphate ions at a higher potential range, i.e., 1.3–3.0
V. The calibration plot was drawn after each experiment was performed
thrice, and average current responses were taken at a gate voltage
of 1.7 V (Figure 4c).
Finally, linear range, sensitivity, and limit of detection were determined
from the current–concentration-calibrated plot. From the slope
of the calibrated plot, the sensitivity was found to be 62.2 μA/cm2/mM. The printed Ag/rGO FET sensor device showed linear range
from 0.005 to 6.00 mM with a high regression coefficient (R2 = 0.99751) and low limit of detection (i.e.,
LOD ∼ 1.20 μM). The LOD was calculated by dividing the
slope of the current–concentration plot (S) with the standard deviation (SD) of response.63

FET sensor device toward solutions (a) without and with 1 mM phosphate
and (b) different phosphate concentrations in 0.1 M HEPES buffer solution.
(c) Calibration curve of the graph (b). The error bars show the mean
value of three current responses.

The sensing mechanism of the phosphate ion detection sensor
was
elucidated and is represented in the below chemical equations. 1   2  The sensing mechanism was further confirmed
by performing the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis
of the Ag/rGO FET sensor, before and after treatment with phosphate
ions as shown in Figure S2 (Supporting
Information). The peak at 367.5 eV in Figure S2a (black spectra) indicates the availability of Ag+ ions
in the Ag/rGO composite material. After treatment with phosphate ion
solution, the silver peak shifts slightly to a higher binding energy
value (369.5 eV). This indicates that Ag+ ions interact
with the PO4– ions already available
in the phosphate ion solution, resulting in the increase in drain
current. The major shift in the peak position of silver (Ag 3d) and
slight shifts in the peak positions of oxygen (O 1s) and carbon (C
1s) indicate the major role of silver in the entire electrocatalytic
performance. Besides, the presence of the phosphorous (P 2p) peak
at 135.6 eV (Figure S2d) further reveals
the adsorption and redox reactions at the sensor surface. Comparison
of the nozzle-jet-printed Ag/rGO FET phosphate ion sensor with the
previously reported ones is summarized in Table 1. The overall performance of the Ag/rGO FET
sensors reveals better capability than that of the previously reported
ones.

The selectivity and interference test of the nozzle-jet-printed
Ag/rGO FET sensors was carried out by separately detecting 1 mM each
of phosphate and other individual interfering ions such as, SO42–, Mg2+, K+, HCO3–, Ca2+, and thiamine pyrophosphate
chloride (TPP) in 0.1 M HEPES buffer (pH 7.4), as shown in Figure 5a. Their calibrated
responses were plotted in the form of a histogram, at a gate voltage
of 1.7 V, as presented in Figure 5b. It can be observed from the calibrated histogram
that our fabricated sensors are selective for PO4– ion measurements in the presence of other interfering ions.

Ag/rGO FET sensor showing the response of phosphate ions and individual
interfering ions (each 1 mM) in 0.1 M HEPES buffer solution, (b) calibrated
histogram plot, where the response of phosphate ion was set as 100%.
The error bars show the mean value of three current responses.

The reproducibility test was carried
out by preparing five nozzle-jet-printed
Ag/rGO FET sensors in similar conditions for the detection of 1.0
mM phosphate ions in 0.1 M HEPES (pH 7.4) solution by I–V method, as shown in Figure 6a. The calibrated histogram in the inset
of Figure 6a reveals
a relative standard deviation (RSD) of ∼2.5%. The stability
of a single Ag/rGO FET sensor, stored under normal conditions, was
checked for four consecutive weeks as shown in Figure 6b. The corresponding calibrated plot in the
inset of Figure 6b
confirmed excellent stability with a current loss of ∼2.0%
during 1 mM phosphate ion detection. Again, all calibrated drain current
responses were recorded at a gate voltage of 1.7 V. In general, the
present nozzle-jet-printed Ag/rGO FET sensor device exhibited excellent
reproducibility and stability, which prompts the use of nozzle-jet-printed
nonenzymatic FET sensor for real-time detection of phosphate.

Ag/rGO FET sensor devices and (b) I–V response of a single Ag/rGO FET sensor device in 0.1 M
HEPES buffer solution containing 1 mM phosphate solution. The error
bars show the mean value of three current responses.

The standard addition-recovery-based method was
utilized for practical
application to detect the phosphate ions in a real water sample using
the Ag/rGO FET sensor, and the results are shown in Figure 7. The water sample collected
from a local lake revealed 0.05 ± 0.015 mM phosphate ions with
the Ag/rGO FET sensor. Practically, known concentrations of phosphate
salt were added to four samples of lake water, and the phosphate ion
concentrations were subsequently measured. The results showed satisfactory
recoveries of about 100% for the added known phosphate ion concentrations
(i.e., 0.07, 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 mM), as represented in Table 2. Thus, it can be concluded
that the developed nozzle-jet-printed Ag/rGO FET nonenzymatic sensor
displays a unique and potential reliability for the detection of phosphate
ions in real water samples.

Conclusions
We have successfully
fabricated a nozzle-jet-printed Ag/rGO FET
enzymeless phosphate ion sensor on flexible PET substrates. The Ag
precursor ink and Ag/rGO hybrid ink were prepared to print FET devices
with good adhesion. The Ag/rGO FET sensor demonstrated excellent performance,
showing high sensitivity (62.2 μA/cm2/mM), wide linear
range (0.005–6.00 mM), and a very low detection limit (∼0.20
μM). The Ag/rGO FET sensor exhibited long-term stability, good
selectivity, high reproducibility, and applicability in real water
samples with high accuracy. Additionally, the proposed method can
be employed for developing various mineral ion sensors for large-scale
production. Hence, the nozzle-jet printing technique can provide an
efficient strategic way for the development of cost-effective, large-scale
production, highly efficient, and environmentally friendly sensing
electrodes for various electroanalytic applications.

were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All aqueous solutions were prepared
using Milli-Q water purified deionized water.

Formulation of Hybrid Ag/rGO
Ink
Ag/rGO hybrid ink
was formulated from silver and rGO inks as shown in Scheme 1a. Prior to the formulation
of Ag/rGO composite ink, silver ink and rGO powder were synthesized
separately as discussed in our earlier reports.61,69 Primarily, rGO ink was synthesized by mixing 10 mg of rGO fine powder
in 4.5 mL of deionized water and 4.5 mL of ethanol followed by sonication
for 30 min. Subsequently, ethanolamine (0.2 mL) and 2% HEC (1 mL)
were added separately as dispersing agents. Additionally, the additives
(ethanolamine and 2% HEC) maintain the viscosity of the ink and avoid
clogging problems of the ink in the nozzle during the printing process.
The whole solution was sonicated for around 10 h and then kept standing
for 30 min. The supernatant of well-dispersed rGO solution was transferred
into another glass vial, and finally, 2 mL of silver precursor ink
was thoroughly mixed in it. The obtained black-colored solution represents
the hybrid Ag/rGO ink.

Fabrication of Ag/rGO FET
Sensors
In the FET sensor
(Scheme 1b), source
and drain electrodes were fabricated by nozzle-jet printing technology
using Ag precursor ink on the PET substrate at a nozzle speed of 4000
mm/s and a nozzle pressure of ∼40 kPa. The printed electrodes
were annealed at 90 °C for 1 h. Thereafter, a channel of Ag/rGO
active material with a width of 0.1 cm and a length of 0.5 cm was
twice overprinted between source and drain Ag electrodes at a nozzle
speed of 4000 mm/s and a nozzle pressure of ∼50 kPa. The thickness
of the Ag/rGO channel can be controlled either by varying nozzle moving
speeds (1000–8000 mm/s) or using nozzles of different diameters.
However, in the latter case, the viscosity of solution needs proper
optimization. The fully printed devices were annealed at 130 °C
for 1 h on a hot plate. After annealing, the Ag NPs embedded within
rGO sheets provide excellent adhesion on the PET substrate. An optical
image of nozzle-jet-printed Ag/rGO-based FET sensor devices has been
shown in Scheme 1c.

Characterization
The surface morphology of electrodes
was characterized with field-emission scanning electron microscopy
(FESEM, Hitachi S4700) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). X-ray diffraction
(XRD), elemental mapping, and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy
were used to analyze the high crystallinity, element distribution,
and element composition of the printed Ag/rGO, respectively. The thickness
of the printed features was measured by a 2D surface profiler with
a scan length 1.2 μm, scan speed 100 μm/s, and sampling
rate of 50 Hz. All of the electrical characterizations were performed
using a probe-station-attached semiconductor parameter analyzer (model:
HP 4155A) in ambient conditions. For analyte detection, a floating
gate (Ag/AgCl) was utilized to measure the drain current with a fixed
drain–source voltage of 0.1 V, whereas the gate–source
voltage was increased in the range of 0–3.0 V. The different
concentrations of analyte solutions (each 10 μL) were pipetted
into the active area/channel area between source–drain electrodes,
and electrical measurements were immediately performed. For each measurement,
the electrodes were rinsed in a buffer prior to reuse. All experiments
were performed in 0.1 M HEPES buffer (pH = 7.5) solution containing
different phosphate concentrations.
