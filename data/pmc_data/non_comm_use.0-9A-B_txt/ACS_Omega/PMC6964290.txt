As one of the most toxic metal pollutants,
mercury is the subject of extensive research to improve current detection
strategies, notably to develop sensitive, selective, fast, and affordable
Hg2+-responsive fluorescent probes. Comprehending the sensing
mechanism of these molecules is a crucial step in their design and
optimization of their performance. Herein, a new fluorescein-based
thionocarbonate-appended Hg2+-sensitive probe was synthesized
to study the hydrolysis reactions involved in the sensing process.
Autohydrolysis was revealed as a significant component of the signal
generation mechanism, occurring concurrently with Hg2+-catalyzed
hydrolysis. This knowledge was used to investigate the effects of
key experimental conditions (pH, temperature, chloride ions) on sensing
efficiency. Overall, the chemical and physical properties of this
new thionocarbonated dye and the insights into its sensing mechanism
will be instrumental in designing reliable and effective portable
sensing strategies for mercury and other heavy metals.

Introduction
Among heavy metal ion pollutants, mercury
is one of the most known
and well studied due to its highly toxic nature and considerable presence
in the environment.1,2 More precisely, its ability to
bioaccumulate and biomagnify through the food chain threatens human
health by causing damaging effects mainly on the respiratory, endocrine,
and central nervous systems.3,4 For these reasons, the
United States Environment Protection Agency (EPA) has set the maximum
tolerable level of mercury contamination in drinking water at 2 ppb
(10 nM).5 Other governmental agencies have
set stricter recommendations, such as Health Canada, which endorses
a tolerable level of 1 ppb (5 nM) in drinking water, equivalent to
the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines.6,7 Therefore,
the efficient quantification of mercury in biological and environmental
samples is critical to monitor environmental contamination, mitigate
risks, assist the diagnosis of disorders, and amend mercury policies.8

Traditional analytical techniques such
as atomic absorption–emission
spectrometry9,10 and inductively coupled plasma
mass spectrometry11,12 are commonly used for the quantification
of mercury species with high reliability thanks to their sensitivity
and accuracy. However, such sophisticated instrumentation is costly,
bulky, not easily amenable to in-field use, and requires qualified
personnel to ensure efficient operation. Thus, in the past several
years, there has been growing interest in low-priced, rapid, and miniaturized
detection methods suitable for real-time and field-deployable sensing
of heavy metals. Among alternative strategies available, optical probes—and
notably those based on colorimetry and fluorimetry—stand out
thanks to their fast response, relatively low cost, and adequate selectivity,
as well as their compatibility with simple, compact, and robust instrumentation
platforms.13−15 For instance, many rhodamine-based probes have been
developed for selective Hg2+ sensing through coordination
chemistry or Hg2+-mediated chemical reactions, generating
changes in the absorbance and fluorescence of the dye.16,17 Even though their development is promising for real-life applications,
scientific advances are still required to make them easier to synthesize,
faster, more sensitive, reusable, and water-friendly in the prospect
of achieving eco-friendly and efficient probes.

Recently, molecular
probes with a thionocarbonate moiety as the
recognition receptor were reported for the detection of Hg2+. The strategy exploits the inhibition and recovery of intramolecular
charge transfer (ICT) in fluorophores through derivatization of their
hydroxyl group with a thionocarbonate (Scheme 1). The interaction of the latter with Hg2+ induces a hydrolysis process, releasing the alcohol-appended
dye. This approach has been reported with fluorescent dye families
with distinct photophysical properties such as resorufins,18,19 7-hydroxy-4-methylcoumarin,20 2-(2′-hydroxyphenyl)benzothiazole,21 N-butyl-4-hydroxy-1,8-naphthalimide,22 and seminaphthorhodafluor.23 The facile permutation of the dye moiety within a common
sensing mechanism allows adapting the dye characteristics to the application
at hand. Furthermore, the reported structures operate in aqueous media
and have good selectivity toward Hg2+. Although the limits
of detection (LOD) reported in Scheme 1 are higher than for conventional lab-based techniques,
many of them remain below the maximum tolerable levels described previously,
and examples of application in real samples such as natural water20,21 and living cells19,23 have been reported recently,
demonstrating the potential of this thionocarbonated family for in-field
and real-time sensing platforms. Despite the promise of these thionocarbonate-based
dyes, previous studies have only described the sensing mechanism as
a Hg2+-induced hydrolysis process, without examining the
role of autohydrolysis in the signal generation process. Yet, because
autohydrolysis is an intrinsic attribute of the thionocarbonate moiety
that can negatively impact the LODs achieved, understanding the role
of Hg2+ in the hydrolysis process is imperative in allowing
the development of robust and reliable probes, with a clear understanding
of their limitations and how to overcome them.

Scheme 1 Synthesis and Hg2+ Sensing Mechanism Through Hydrolysis
of Thionocarbonate-Appended Dyes
In the present work, an investigation of the
hydrolytic processes
observed in thionocarbonate-based probes is described using a customized
fluorescein-based compound. Fluorescein, a member of the xanthene
class like seminaphthorhodafluor, is a commercially available and
inexpensive fluorophore offering a very high molar absorptivity coefficient
and fluorescence quantum yield.24 The dye
is available both as a sodium salt and as an acid, with the latter
bearing hydroxyl groups that are conducive to Hg2+ sensing
through a combination with thionocarbonates. In fact, fluorescein
acid has been used as a backbone receptor for targets such as superoxide,25−28 perborate,29 and hydrogen peroxide30 through the reaction of phenolic hydroxyl groups
with adequate substituents. Although the inhibition and recovery of
ICT may be involved in the turn-on mechanism for some of the probes
based on this particular structure, the major contribution to the
overall transduction process arises from the nonemissive spirolactone
conformation, which is subject to hydrolytic deprotection and spiro
ring opening to yield the emissive fluorescein. Hence, we believe
appending thionocarbonate groups to the fluorescein’s hydroxyl
moieties embodies a promising avenue for studying auto- and Hg2+-catalyzed hydrolyses.

The probe is prepared in a single
synthesis step from a commercially
available fluorescein acid dye (Scheme 2). Examination of the compound’s auto- and Hg2+-assisted hydrolyses provides insight on its sensing mechanism.
More precisely, the hydrolysis process is investigated through mass
spectrometry, selectivity measurements, and isolation of an intermediate
compound.

Scheme 2 Probe 1 and Its Hydrolysis Pathways
Results and Discussion
Synthesis and General Characteristics
As shown in Scheme 3, compound 1 can be readily prepared in a single step with a high yield
(93%). Compared to similar molecular probes reported with a carbonothioate
moiety, no preliminary synthesis was required to generate an alcohol-appended
fluorophore thanks to the commercial availability of fluorescein acid
and o-phenyl chlorothionoformate, avoiding time-consuming
and costly synthetic procedures.

Scheme 3 Synthesis of Probe 1
The absorption properties of the new thionocarbonate-bearing
compound
compared to that of its commercial precursor can be seen by the naked
eye. Fluorescein is bright red in the solid state, whereas 1 is crystalline white (Figure 1). This characteristic color of the commercial acid is due
to the stable delocalized quinoid form leading to strong absorption
in the visible region.31 In solution, however,
the compound exists as a tautomeric equilibrium between the quinoid
and lactone forms. In nonpolar and mildly polar solvents such as dichloromethane,
the equilibrium leans toward the lactone form,32 making two phenolic segments available for reacting with o-phenyl chlorothionoformate to form compound 1. The resulting product preserves the spirolactone conformation in
its backbone, preventing the delocalization of electrons along the
xanthene moiety, thus leading to low molar absorptivity in the visible
region. 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) supports this
hypothesis by displaying a signal at 81.1 ppm, distinctive of the
sp3-hybridized carbon atom of a spirolactone (Figure S2). Furthermore, the spectral properties
of 1 were measured by UV–visible spectrophotometry
in an N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES)
buffer solution (20 mM, pH 7.4) containing 1% EtOH to increase solubility.
As presented in Figure 1, the molecule indeed shows no distinct absorption band in the visible
region due to the lack of delocalization along its backbone. In contrast,
upon the addition of 2 equiv of Hg2+, a band at 490 nm
appears with a shoulder at around 455 nm, which is characteristic
of quinoid fluorescein. These observations suggest the hydrolysis
of compound 1 to yield the free fluorescein structure
in the presence of Hg2+.

Figure 1 Absorption spectra of 1 (5
μM) in a HEPES buffer
solution (20 mM, pH 7.4, 1% EtOH) and 60 min after the addition of
2 equiv of Hg2+. The spectrum of commercial fluorescein
acid in the same conditions is shown as a reference. Inset: photographs
of 1 and of the commercial precursor in their solid state.

Fluorescence Response of 1 Toward Hydrolysis
The emission spectrum of 1 was obtained in a HEPES
buffer solution (20 mM, pH 7.4, 1% EtOH). As expected, the thionocarbonate-appended
fluorescein alone shows minimal fluorescence when excited at the absorption
maximum of fluorescein (λexc = 490 nm). However,
the fluorescence band centered at 516 nm increases over time, reaching
a ∼7-fold increase in intensity at λmax after
90 min (Figure 2A).
Although not reported previously for thionocarbonate-based mercury
sensors, the sulfur-rich carbonate is prone to hydrolysis even in
the absence of cations.33 Thus, compound 1’s spontaneous reaction with water is not unexpected,
and observation of the latter provides additional insight pertaining
to the mechanisms behind the release of the alcohol-exposed fluorophore
upon Hg2+ sensing. It is worth mentioning that the awareness
acquired on the importance of autohydrolysis can also be applied to
other metal ion probes exploiting hydrolysis in their detection mechanism,
such as Cu2+.34,35

Figure 2 Time dependence of the
fluorescence spectra of 1 μM of 1 (A) without Hg2+ and (B) with 2 equiv of Hg2+. Insets: time dependence
of the fluorescence at λem,max = 516 nm. Conditions:
25 °C in a HEPES buffer solution
(20 mM, pH 7.4, 1% EtOH).

When 2 equiv of Hg2+ are added to the
reaction medium,
fluorescein emission at 516 nm becomes clearly distinguishable as
early as 5 min following Hg2+ addition, reaching an ∼80-fold
increase after 90 min (Figure 2B). Although not thoroughly discussed in previous reports,
the lack of a plateau within 10 min of Hg2+ addition has
been noted as a common feature of thionocarbonate-based probes. The
relatively longer completion time compared to the other analogs may
be explained by the need to jettison two carbonothioate moieties before
the ICT of quinoid fluorescein can be recovered. A good way to skirt
the long reaction time of 1 in this study is to measure
the former’s response kinetically at λmax.
Indeed, an efficient fluorimetric reaction-rate method has been reported
for thiamine determination via oxidation to fluorescent thiochrome.36 In a similar fashion, the Hg2+-assisted
and autohydrolysis responses of probe 1 can be reported
as reaction rate r through the first derivative of
their time-dependent fluorescence behavior at 516 nm. For instance,
the fluorescence signal of 1 in the presence of 2 equiv
of Hg2+ increases at a rate r1+Hg2+ of 1501 s–1, whereas the
spontaneous hydrolysis occurs at a rate r1 of 74 s–1, leading to a relative ratio r1+Hg2+/r1 of 20 in these conditions (Table 1). Thus, the kinetic rate r can serve as the measured variable in spectrofluorimetric experiments
to characterize the mechanistic properties of compound 1, instead of the absolute fluorescence signal.

intensities at 0 and 90 min, respectively, whereas r designates the fluorescence kinetic rate for 1−3.

Mechanistic Investigations of the Hydrolysis of 1
Based on the summary observations described above, the
hydrolysis pathway undergone by compound 1 is hypothesized
to be a two-step hydrolysis with consecutive second-order reactions37 (Scheme 4), with the associated second-order rate equations defined
as 1   2   3  

Scheme 4 Consecutive Second-Order Reactions Occurring
upon Hydrolysis of Compound 1, Where k1 and k2 Represent the Respective
Reaction Rates
Due to the large excess of water molecules in
the reaction medium,
each rate equation may be treated as a pseudo-first-order reaction.
The fluorescent signal intensity from free fluorescein molecules (Figure 2) would presumably
continue to increase until complete consumption of the mono- and dicarbonothioate-bearing
spirolactones, at which point the emission intensity would stabilize.
This interpretation is also valid for Hg-rich conditions where the
latter may act as a catalyst in both steps of the hydrolysis process.
Indeed, fluorescence measurements suggest the formation of free fluorescein
due to both autohydrolysis and Hg2+ sensing, albeit at
different rates. To confirm this, mass spectrometry was performed
on probe 1 in water and in the presence of 2 equiv of
Hg2+. Figure 3 shows the mass spectra obtained 5 min after solution preparation.
The spectrum without Hg2+ shows a major peak at m/z = 605.0706 attributed to probe 1. A significant peak is also observed at m/z = 469.0725, which agrees with a single-fold hydrolysis
of probe 1’s thionocarbonate moiety to yield a
hydroxyl-bearing derivative (compound 2, Scheme 4). Furthermore, traces of fluorescein
can be identified at m/z = 330.0746.
These signals support the autohydrolysis of 1 by a two-step
process, occurring as soon as 5 min after the aqueous solution is
prepared. The spectrum of 1 taken 5 min after adding
2 equiv of Hg2+ shows the same main peaks but in different
proportions. Qualitatively, the signal ascribed to fluorescein is
more intense than in the case of compound 2. This suggests
that exposition to Hg2+ favors the same chemical process
(i.e., hydrolysis) but leads to the final fluorescein product faster.
This is coherent with the fluorescence data shown previously for both
the free and Hg2+-exposed probes, where the fluorescence
rate is faster for the latter.

of 1 in water
(pH 7.4, containing 10% EtOH) and with 2 equiv of Hg2+.
Spectra were recorded 5 min after sample preparation and normalized
to the signal at m/z = 605.0706.

The specific role of Hg2+ as a facilitator
for the hydrolysis
is explained by the cation’s soft Lewis acidity. Indeed, the
coordination of mercury to sulfur increases the electrophilicity of
the carbon atom of the C=S bond, thus making the site more
reactive toward hydrolysis and accelerating the process. This catalytic
activity is supported by a study showing that alkali metal ions, thanks
to their Lewis acidity, may catalyze the ethanolysis of substituted o-phenyl thionocarbonates.38 Moreover,
the efficiency of the assisted hydrolysis follows Pearson’s
qualitative HSAB concept,39 with soft acids
allowing to coordinate a soft C=S site to catalyze the nucleophilic
attack. The importance of the nature of the electrophilic center was
confirmed by synthesizing the analogous dicarbonated fluorescein ester
(compound 3, Scheme 5) and assessing its Hg2+-assisted hydrolytic
reactivity. Table 1 and Figure S7 show that 3 has behavior in water similar to 1 with an autohydrolysis
rate of 38 s–1. However, 3 does not
show significant enhancement in its fluorescence rate upon the addition
of Hg2+, indicating that the latter has minimal effect
on the hydrolysis process. This experiment confirms that the soft
sulfurated coordination site is crucial in ensuring the binding of
bivalent mercury ions and the subsequent accelerated hydrolysis of
probe 1.

Scheme 5 Synthesis of Compound 3
On the other hand, the soft acid–base
condition for Hg sensing
of this system also explains the selectivity toward Hg usually reported
for thionocarbonated probes. The hydrolysis rate of probe 1 was measured in the presence of various metal ions. As seen in Figure 4, the process is
quite specific to Hg2+ ions across a series of 20 other
cations tested in equimolar amounts. Most species do not generate
a response exceeding the probe’s autohydrolysis. Exceptions
to this trend are Ag+ and Au3+, which, although
not always tested in reported thionocarbonate-based Hg2+ sensing probes, are known to be thiophilic.40 This positive correlation between thiophilicity and reactivity with
probe 1 supports the importance of this parameter on
the design of cation-sensitive molecular probes operating on the principle
of catalyzed hydrolysis. For environmental detection purposes, the
probe’s sensitivity toward Ag+ and Au3+ is not a serious issue as these ions are seldom found at relevant
concentrations in natural waters.41,42 An interference
experiment was also performed and showed a negligible effect of excess
amounts of most metallic cations on the probe’s kinetic response
toward Hg2+ (Figure S8).

2 μM of various ions. Conditions: 1 μM of 1 in a HEPES buffer solution (20 mM, pH 7.4, 1% EtOH) at 25 °C.
Error bars represent RSD (n = 2).

Effect of Sample Matrix on the Hydrolysis Behavior of 1
To deepen our understanding of the hydrolysis processes
pertaining to the Hg2+ sensing ability of compound 1, the effect of temperature, pH, and chloride ions was investigated.
In particular, conditions that minimize the spontaneous hydrolysis
of 1 while maintaining high sensitivity in Hg2+-rich matrices are expected to result in an optimal signal-to-noise
ratio and thus lower detection limits.

Figure 5 summarizes the effect of temperature in
the range of 20–70 °C on the free probe and in the presence
of 2 equiv of Hg2+. The fluorescence intensity of 1 increases faster at higher temperatures, regardless of the
presence of Hg2+. However, the temperature does not affect
the reaction rates of auto- and Hg-mediated hydrolyses identically.
Although the measured rate in this study is not the reaction rate
as defined in Arrhenius’ law, plotting the natural log of fluorescence
rate r against T–1 for both Hg2+-rich and Hg2+-poor samples provides
slopes representative of the magnitude of the activation energies
for both pathways (Figure 5B). The lesser slope for the Hg2+-rich system suggests
lower overall activation energy, agreeing with the cation’s
role as a catalyst in the hydrolysis process. From the point of view
of Hg2+ sensing efficiency, these results also allow us
to determine an optimal temperature range. The hydrolysis rate ratio
between the Hg2+-reacted probe and its free form (r1+Hg2+/r1) decreases from 11 at 20 °C to 3 at higher temperatures
due to a higher autohydrolysis rate (Figure 5C). Therefore, further experiments were performed
at 25 ± 1 °C, i.e., typical of room-temperature conditions
in most settings.

hydrolysis
rate ratio according to temperature. Conditions: 1 μM of 1 in a HEPES buffer solution (20 mM, pH 7.4, 1% EtOH). Error
bars represent RSD (n = 3).

The effect of pH on the sensing performance of
probe 1 was also investigated. The starting hypothesis
was that the sensor
would be affected not only by pH due to the intrinsic pH sensitivity
of the chosen dye but also by pH due to the amount of hydroxide ions
available for the hydrolysis process. Figure 6A shows the normalized reaction rate r of probe 1 in the pH 3–10 range in
Hg2+-free and Hg2+-rich media. The first observation
is a slow fluorescence increase at low pH values in both media. As
fluorescein is the emissive product from probe 1’s
hydrolysis, this observation is due to the intrinsic pH-dependent
optical properties of the dye.43,44 The neutral quinoid
form of fluorescein prevalent in the pH 3–4 range has a low
absorption cross section at 490 nm (εneutral = 2700
M–1 cm–1) and a low quantum yield
(Φneutral = 29%),45 in
addition, as was discussed previously, to being in equilibrium with
its nonfluorescent spirolactone form (Scheme S1). In the pH 5–10 range, the higher molar absorptivity ε
and fluorescence quantum yield Φ of the monoanionic and dianionic
species (εmonoanion = 16 500 M–1 cm–1, Φmonoanion = 36% and εdianion = 88 000 M–1 cm–1, Φdianion = 93%, respectively) lead to vastly increased
emission intensity.45 The excitation–emission
spectrum of probe 1 in the presence of 2 equiv of Hg2+ was recorded between pH 3 and 10, and the results shown
in Figure 6B are in
accordance with those reported by Slavik in 1994.46 At pH 3, the excitation band with a maximum at 437 nm is
characteristic of the cationic and neutral forms of fluorescein. Spectral
features observed between pH 4 and 5 are indicative of the deprotonation
equilibria involving the monoanionic form. A drastic change in the
spectral profile occurs at pH 6, with the intense fluorescence band
at 490 nm characteristic of the highly emissive dianionic structure
of fluorescein. Thus, the pH dependence of fluorescein emission can
be ascribed as the reason for the lower r measured
below pH 7 in Figure 6A. This explanation is valid for cases with and without Hg2+ ions, since pH affects the properties of the fluorescein product
independently of the hydrolysis process (Figure S9A). Possible effects of pH on the mechanism itself may be
concealed by the features discussed above.

Figure 6 (A) Dependence to pH
of normalized reaction kinetics r of 1. (B, C) Excitation (dotted) and emission (full)
spectra of probe 1 in the presence of 2 equiv of Hg2+ recorded between pH 3–7 and 7–10, respectively.
Conditions: 1 μM of 1 in a HEPES solution (20 mM, 1% EtOH) at
25 °C. All excitation spectra taken at λem =
516 nm. Emission spectra taken at the respective maximum λexc previously acquired. Error bars represent RSD (n = 3).

A decrease in the hydrolysis rate of probe 1 with
2 equiv of Hg2+ is observed at pH ≥ 7 (Figure 6A). This observation
cannot be attributed to the pH-dependent properties of fluorescein
as the latter exists only as the highly emissive dianionic form above
pH ≈ 8. The excitation–emission spectra shown in Figure 6C suggest that the
overall intensity decreases without changes to the dianionic structure.
The most plausible explanation to this decrease in the rate of hydrolysis
is the accessibility of Hg2+ ions, as mercury speciation
data dictates that Hg(OH)2 is the dominant species in alkaline
media.47 The curve shown for probe 1 without mercury (probe 1 only; Figure 6A) supports this hypothesis
and suggests that hydrolysis, in this case, is enhanced by the increase
in hydroxide ion concentration (Figure S9B). The same trend has been reported recently for other thionocarbonate-based
Hg2+-responsive probes,22 but
the authors did not suggest Hg2+ speciation as a possible
cause for the loss of sensing efficiency. Consequently, all following
experiments were performed in a HEPES buffer solution at pH 7.4, where
mercury ions are deemed dissolved at the concentration employed.47

Interference from chloride, a major ionic
component of real-life
samples (e.g., natural surface waters) was also studied since Hg tends
to form stable chloride complexes that could affect the metal’s
efficiency as a Lewis acid in sensing experiments with probe 1. The presence of sodium chloride in the sample matrix was
found to negatively affect the probe’s response at concentrations
greater than 1 mM (Figure S10A). This is
in accordance with the speciation diagrams for chloride complexes
of bivalent mercury in aqueous solutions, where the predominant species
at pH 7 with ∼1 mM NaCl is a soluble HgCl2 complex.48 This hypothesis is supported by the comparison
of fluorescence spectra of 1 recorded in both salt-free
and salt-rich environments (Figure S10B),
an indication that chloride has no measurable fluorescence-quenching
effect on the hydrolyzed product (i.e., fluorescein) at these concentration
levels.

Fluorescence Response of 2 Toward Hydrolysis
To investigate the optical properties, hydrolytic behavior, and
sensing ability of intermediary compound 2 identified
through mass spectrometry (MS) analysis, the latter was synthesized
and isolated by modifying the original synthesis protocol to favor
a single-fold condensation instead of a twofold reaction (Scheme 6). In a similar fashion
to the free fluorescein acid, the fluorescein monoether derivative
may exist as a tautomeric equilibrium between its lactone and quinoid
structures. However, in opposition to compound 1, the 13C NMR of 2 does not indicate a signal attributed
to the sp3-hybridized carbon atom of a spirolactone (Figure S4), suggesting that the molecule exists
as the ring-opened quinoid xanthene in CDCl3. Moreover,
UV–visible and fluorescence spectra in water-free chloroform
have confirmed that 2 does neither absorb significantly
in the visible region nor exhibit fluorescence when excited at 490
nm (results not shown). These findings suggest that even though the
molecule is present in its quinoid form, it is nonemissive. This is
due to the inhibition of ICT that is otherwise occurring between the
electron-donating phenol and electron-withdrawing carbonyl moieties
appended to the xanthene core of fluorescein.44,49 In compound 2, the electron-donating ability of the
phenol is restricted by its bonding to the thionocarbonate moiety.
Therefore, isolation of the ICT-inhibited compound 2 supports
the hypothesis that fluorescein is the only emitting species resulting
from the hydrolytic processes under study with compound 1.

Scheme 6 Synthesis of 2 and Its Tautomerization Reaction
To compare the hydrolytic reactivity of compounds 1 and 2, the emission spectrum of as-synthesized 2 was measured over time in a HEPES buffer solution (20 mM,
pH 7.4, 1% EtOH) (Figure 7A). The spectrum of compound 2 alone reveals
an emission band characteristic of free fluorescein when excited at
fluorescein’s absorption maximum (λexc = 490
nm). Since the pure quinoid molecule has been determined to be nonemissive
in water-free solvents, this signal is hypothesized to be caused by
the autohydrolysis of the carbonothioate moiety. Indeed, similarly
to experiments with probe 1, the autohydrolysis of 2 leads to an increasing fluorescence band at 516 nm, reaching
a 12-fold fluorescence intensity after 90 min (I90/I0). The probe’s fluorescence
increases more rapidly than probe 1, with a rate r2 of 645 s–1 compared to 74
s–1 for r1 in the same
conditions (Table 1). This faster pace is most likely explained by a single-fold hydrolysis
process compared to the dicarbonothioated version, which must undergo
two hydrolysis steps per molecule to yield the emissive form. Moreover,
the study of this intermediate confirms that its hydrolysis is not
a limiting step in the two-step consecutive hydrolysis of probe 1 proposed in Scheme 4.

(20 mM, pH 7.4, 1% EtOH).

The addition of 2 equiv of Hg2+ to probe 2 leads to a steeper nonlinear increase in fluorescence, reaching
an ∼80-fold increase after 90 min (Figure 7B). The first derivative of the relationship
yields an rprobe+Hg2+ of 5480 s–1, compared to 1501 s–1 for 1. This higher rate can be explained by the single-fold
hydrolysis of 2, with 2 equiv of Hg2+ per
reactive site.

Impact of Autohydrolysis on Quantification of Hg2+
The sensitivity of compound 1 toward Hg2+ was examined between 0 and 2 equiv of Hg2+ (0–2
μM) (Figure 8). The linear range extends to 1.6 μM, at which point the kinetic
rate plateaus. The detection limit for Hg2+ using probe 1 was calculated as 0.8 nM (3σ/slope), with the signal
background due to spontaneous hydrolysis being the limiting factor.
The resulting linear range extends over more than 3 orders of magnitude.
The tolerable level of mercury contamination in drinking water being
set at 1 ppb (5 nM) by WHO, this result demonstrates that a 1 μM
solution of compound 1 has the potential to detect Hg2+ at relevant concentrations. Hence, this study is an important
addition to the known library of thionocarbonated dyes as it demonstrates
competitive performance, but mostly a better comprehension of limitations
of these hydrolysis-based Hg probes.

μM of the probe in a HEPES buffer solution (20 mM, pH 7.4, 1%
EtOH) at 25 °C. Error bars represent RSD (n =
3).

A calibration curve was also determined for intermediate
compound 2 to compare the sensitivity of 1 and 2 toward Hg2+ sensing (Figure S11). The result shows a linear range reaching 0.6
equiv of Hg2+. The narrower linearity range of 2 can be explained
by the presence of only one reactive site per molecule. The detection
limit of probe 2 was calculated as 40 nM (3σ/slope).
Although the faster hydrolysis of compound 2 leads to
a steeper slope than that obtained for 1, the high spontaneous
hydrolysis severely impacts the LOD achieved.

Conclusions
To summarize, an Hg2+-responsive
thionocarbonate-appended
fluorescent probe was developed using a one-step synthesis. The contribution
of auto- and Hg2+-assisted hydrolyses to the probe’s
overall operation was investigated by kinetic fluorescence monitoring
and mass spectrometry. The role of Hg2+ as a soft Lewis
acid catalyst accelerating the consecutive hydrolytic processes was
supported by a selectivity assay, a temperature-based experiment,
and the isolation of an intermediate compound. The influence of pH
and chloride ions on the probe’s response to Hg2+ was also characterized, stressing the importance of speciation on
the availability of Hg2+ for sensing. Overall, this addition
to the library of available thionocarbonated dyes and the insights
into their sensing mechanism will be instrumental in designing reliable
and effective portable sensing strategies for mercury and other thiophilic
metals.

C34H20O9+H+: 573.1180
[M + H]+; found, 573.1261.

Stock Solutions
The 20 mM HEPES buffer solution was
prepared from the corresponding commercial salt dissolved in water,
and its pH was adjusted with HNO3 and NaOH solutions using
a pH meter. Stock solutions (100 μM) of compounds 1–3 were prepared by dissolving the solids in
anhydrous EtOH. To prevent spontaneous hydrolysis during storage,
the probes were always kept as solids or in water-free ethanol stock
solutions preserved at 4 °C for up to 2 weeks without significant
hydrolysis. A 100 μM Hg2+ stock solution was prepared
by diluting and neutralizing a 5 mM ICP standard solution with NaOH
in nanopure water. All other cation solutions were prepared in a similar
fashion from their neutralized commercially available ICP standard
solutions.

Instrumental Considerations for Kinetic Fluorescence Monitoring
For all kinetic-based fluorescence results, the spectrofluorimeter
was set with the following parameters: 1 or 2 nm slits, λexc = 490 nm, λem = 516 nm, Δt = 15 s with the shutter closed between data points to
minimize photobleaching. All samples were continuously stirred with
a magnetic stir bar in the quartz cell, and the temperature was equilibrated
2 min before starting all kinetic studies. Each sample was measured
in two or three replicates, and the treated data was averaged with
the corresponding standard deviation taken as the uncertainty. All
final data for a given experiment were then normalized to prevent
instrumental fluctuations from affecting data interpretation across
different experiments. Absolute values were only used for the calibration
curves.

Sample Preparation for Kinetic Fluorescence Monitoring
To 1.98 mL of HEPES buffer in a quartz cell was added 20 μL
of 1 stock solution. The cuvette was placed in the spectrometer’s
sample compartment to acquire autohydrolysis data. Fluorescence measurements
were taken at intervals of 15 s over a total time of 120 s. For Hg2+-assisted hydrolysis, the probe-containing cuvette was spiked
with 40 μL of the analyte stock solution, and fluorescence measurements
were again taken each 15 s over a total time of 780 s. For both situations,
the data was plotted as intensity (I) vs time (t) and the derivative was taken to report rprobe and rprobe+Hg2+. For temperature studies, the cuvette and buffer solutions
were left to equilibrate at the desired temperature before adding
compound 1.

For selectivity studies, the 100 μM
stock solution of Hg2+ was replaced with 100 μM solutions
of selected cations. For sensitivity experiments, Hg2+ stock
solutions of 0–100 μM were prepared to preserve the volume
(40 μL) spiked in the cuvette across all standards.

Sample Preparation for Mass Spectrometry
Of a 500 μM
stock solution of 1 in EtOH, 90 μL was added to
0.9 mL of either pure water or a 100 μM Hg2+ stock
solution. The EtOH content was adjusted to 10% v/v by adding 10 μL
of the latter. The sample was placed in the apparatus, and data was
acquired 5 min after solution preparation. One can note that the concentrations
used are 45 times higher than those for fluorescence studies to ensure
proper MS detection. The use of a larger proportion of the EtOH-based
stock solution of 1 implies higher EtOH content in the
sample than for fluorescence studies. The impact of this EtOH content
on hydrolysis has been swiftly investigated and was found to slightly
decrease the fluorescence kinetics, r, either from
a slower reaction or from a less efficient emission of the generated
fluorescein.
