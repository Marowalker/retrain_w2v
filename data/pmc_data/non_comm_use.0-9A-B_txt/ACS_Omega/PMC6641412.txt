Although the transition from B-DNA
to the A-form is essential for
many biological concerns, the properties of this transition have not
been resolved. The B to A equilibrium can be analyzed conveniently
because of the significant changes in circular dichroism (CD) and
absorption spectrum. CD and linear dichroism (LD) methods were used
to examine the binding of water-soluble meso-tetrakis(N-methylpyridinium-4-yl)porphyrin (TMPyP) and its derivatives,
Co-TMPyP, with B- and A-calf thymus DNA. B- to A-transitions occurred
when the physiological buffer was replaced with a water-ethanol mixture
(∼80 v/v %), and the fluorescence emission spectra of TMPyP
bound to DNA showed a different pattern under ethanol–water
conditions and water alone. The featureless broad emission bands of
TMPyP were split into two peaks near at 658 and 715 nm in the presence
of DNA under an aqueous solution. In the case of an ethanol–water
system, however, the emission bands are split in two peaks near at
648 and 708 nm and 656 and 715 nm with and without DNA, respectively.
This may be due to a change in the solution polarity. On the basis
of the CD and LD data, TMPyP interacts with B-DNA via intercalation
at a low ratio under a low ionic strength, 1 mM sodium phosphate.
On the other hand, the interaction with A-DNA (80 v/v % ethanol–water
system) occurs in a nonintercalating manner. This difference might
be because the structural conformations, such as the groove of A-DNA,
are not as deep as in B-DNA and the bases are much more tilted. In
the case of Co-TMPyP, porphyrin binds preferably via an outside self-stacking
mode with B- and A-DNA.

==== Body
Introduction
The structure of DNA
can be described by a number of parameters,
such as the diameter of the helix, the tilt of the base pairs, the
nature of the grooves of the helix, and the twist of the base pairs.1,2 Most of the DNA is in the classic Watson–Crick model, simply
called B-form DNA. Under certain conditions, different forms of DNAs
appear like A (originally identified by X-ray diffraction of analysis
of DNA fibers at 75% relative humidity)-,3,4 Z
(left-handed double-helical structure winds to the left in a zig-zag
pattern)-,5 C (formed at 66% relative humidity
and in the presence of Li+ and Mg2+ ions)-,6 D (rare variant with eight base pairs per helical
turn, form in structure devoid of guanine)-, and E (extended or eccentric)-DNA
(Vinitha Unnikrishnan, 2015, unpublished results). This deviation
in forms is based on their structural diversity. Ethanol at high salt
concentrations will induce the aggregation of DNA.7 Synthetic polynucleotides such as poly[d(A-T)2] and poly[d(G-C)2] also undergo a B–A transition
under suitable conditions. Structural transitions were examined in
various synthetic polynucleotides.8,9 Some studies
have shown that a significant activation barrier exists in the B to
A transition and that the helical states are clearly separated from
each other.10 Recently, new molecular dynamics
simulations from A-DNA to B-DNA in solution were reported.11,12 The B to A transition of DNA in water–ethanol solutions has
been studied by circular dichroism (referred to as CD) since the beginning
of 1974. Valery et al. reported that the B–A equilibrium is not influenced
by temperature. This transition may have only a slight dependence
(if any) on the GC content because the transition width is the same
for the heterogeneous calf thymus DNA (referred to as DNA).9 Some research found that water–water interaction
energy correlates with the entropy change, thereby indicating a role
of water in the entropy reduction in the B to A transition.13 The B to A transition, in which low-humidity
conditions locally change the base-stacking arrangement and globally
induce DNA condensation, may eventually stabilize the molecular contour-length
reduction.14 It was reported that the conductance
of DNA duplexes increases by approximately 1 order of magnitude when
its conformation is changed from the B-form to the A-form.15 Hole transport in A-form DNA/RNA hybrid duplexes
has been studied. On the basis of the results, there is no directional
preference of hole migration toward 5′ or 3′ end for
both the B-form and A-form duplexes.16 The Z-conformation favors alternating purine–pyrimidine
repeats, particularly alternated G–C base-pairs, even though
the Z-form is known in other mixed sequences.17 Cationic porphyrins have been known to bind DNA. They display a
wide variety of binding modes, including intercalation,18,19 monomeric minor groove binding,20−25 and moderate and extensive stacking to B-form DNA.26−29 Avetisyan et al. examined the interaction of meso-tetra-(4N-oxyethylpyridyl)porphyrin (TOEPyP4) with the A-form of
DNA. They explored that porphyrin interacts with B-DNA via an intercalation
at low relative concentrations and external binding with increasing
porphyrin to the DNA ratio, whereas the interaction of TOEPyP4 with
A-DNA occurs via the outside binding only. (Proceedings of
the YSU, Physics & Mathematics, 2014,3, 43–48, unpublished result).
In the case of Co-TMPyP, porphyrin interacts with B- and A-DNA only
through external groove binding. To better understand the binding
properties between DNA and porphyrin derivatives under ethanol–water
conditions, herein, we have studied the binding properties of TMPyP
and its Co-containing derivative (Co-TMPyP) bound to the B- and A-forms
of DNA.

Results and Discussion
The concentration of DNA for
this series of measurements was fixed
at 100 μM, whereas that of TMPyP was varied from 1 to 5 μM
in 1 μM increments. The resulting absorption spectra were normalized
to the highest TMPyP concentration for the ease of comparison. Fluorescence
emission spectra measured with a 10-fold diluted DNA–drug solution
to minimize the inner-filter effects.

Absorption Spectroscopic
Properties of TMPyP and Co-TMPyP with
DNA in 80% Relative Humidity
The absorption spectrum of TMPyP
associated with DNA in an aqueous solution may be classified into
two categories. TMPyP that is intercalated to DNA or a GC-rich synthetic
polynucleotide produced large hypochromism and a red shift because
of the increasing π–π stacking and changes in the
porphyrin environment.30,31 The extent of changes in the
absorption spectrum is less pronounced when it binds to the minor
groove or stacked along the DNA stem. The absorption spectra of TMPyP
complexed with DNA under 80% ethanol and aqueous solutions are depicted
in Figure 1A,B. In
the case of ethanol presence, the absorption maxima appeared at ca.
425 nm. Upon binding to DNA, a 23% hypochromism and a 3 nm red shift
were observed (from 424 nm of free TMPyP to 433 nm in the presence
of DNA). Under an aqueous buffer solution, the absorption maxima appeared
at ca. 421 nm. The hypochromism and red shift were 47.3% and 18 nm
(from 421 to 439 nm), respectively. The binding environment may reflect
the change in the binding property.

Figure 1 Absorption spectra of the free TMPyP (black-colored
curve) and
TMPyP complexed with DNA (red-colored curve) in an 80% ethanol solution
(A) and in aqueous buffer solution (B). [TMPyP] = 5 μM and [DNA]
= 100 μM.

Figure S1 depicts the absorption spectrum
of Co-TMPyP bound to DNA under 80% ethanol (A) and aqueous solution
(B). Under the ethanol condition, hyperchromicity was 18% with no
wavelength shift, and a 21% hyperchromism and a 6 nm red shift were
observed in an aqueous buffer solution. The absorption results suggest
that the interactions or binding characteristics of TMPyP or Co-TMPyP
with DNA against those reaction buffer systems (e.g., with different
water activities at the same ionic strength. Herein, the term “water
activity” describes the amount of water available for hydration
of materials) are different from each other.

CD Spectroscopic Properties
Circular dichroism is a
useful tool for tracing
the transition of the B-form to A-form, which is the available one
to detect the shift curve under ethanol/trifluoroethanol conditions.7,32,33Figures 2 and S2 show the
CD spectra that were recorded at an R-ratio of 0.05.
When associated with DNA in an 80% ethanol solution, TMPyP produced
a complex CD spectrum with one positive maxima at 433 nm and a negative
band at 451 nm (Figure 2A). The insertion in Figure 2A is the CD spectrum of the B-form (blue line) and A-form
(red line) DNA in the DNA region. The magnitude of the A-form DNA
is much larger than that of the classical B-form. Under the aqueous
buffer, however, a negative CD spectrum was observed. In general,
a negative CD signal is the main indicator of the intercalative binding
of TMPyP to DNA. On the other hand, the CD spectrum of the DNA and
Co-TMPyP complex under ethanol–water conditions was characterized
by the apparent positive band at 454 nm (Figure S2A), which almost coincides with that observed in the aqueous
solution (Figure S2B). This type of positive
CD band for the porphyrin family is considered diagnostic for the
outside binding mode. A clear bisignate CD spectrum produced by the
DNA–TMPyP complex, which is usually considered to be the result
of a π–π interaction between DNA-bound porphyrin
(stacking interaction), was also against the intercalation binding
mode.

Figure 2 CD spectra of TMPyP complexed with DNA in an 80% ethanol solution
(A) and in an aqueous buffer solution (B). The concentrations are
the same as in Figure 1. Inset: CD spectrum of the B-form (blue curve) and A-form (red curve)
DNA in the DNA region.

Fluorescence Emission Spectroscopic Properties
Fluorescence
spectroscopy is useful for examining the association of the dyes with
proteins, particularly regarding the binding mechanism in terms of
the binding site and structural and conformational alternation under
various microenvironments.34 The intercalative
binding geometry of the DNA intercalator, such as 9-aminoacridin to
DNA, which is independent of the ionic strength, was confirmed to
be different compared to that of the classical intercalation mode.35

Figure 3A,B shows the fluorescence emission spectra of TMPyP
bound to DNA under different buffer systems: ethanol-containing conditions
and aqueous buffer solution, respectively. Under a less polar environment,
which is simulated by 80% ethanol, the observations of DNA were different
from those with the aqueous buffer system. The emission bands of free
TMPyP were split into two peaks near at 658 and 715 nm, and the TMPyP–DNA
complex was split at 648 and 708 nm.

Figure 3 Fluorescence emission spectra of the free
TMPyP (black-colored
curve) and TMPyP complexed with DNA (red-colored curve) in an 80%
ethanol solution (A) and in an aqueous buffer solution (B). [TMPyP]
= 0.5 μM and [DNA] = 10 μM, respectively.

In the case of TMPyP in an aqueous solution, the
featureless broad
emission bands of the free TMPyP were split into two peaks near 656
and 715 nm in the presence of DNA. As expected, the observations were
different under the ethanol–water system and under aqueous
buffer system, respectively. These results are probably due to the
different solution polarity or local environment.

Reduced Linear
Dichroism Spectroscopic Properties
Figure 4 shows the reduced
linear dichroism (LDr) spectrum obtained by division of
the measured LD by the absorption spectrum. In the DNA–TMPyP
complex in an aqueous solution, a wavelength-dependent signal with
a comparable or larger magnitude than that of the DNA absorption region
was apparent,24 suggesting an intercalative
binding mode. On the other hand, a large tilt between the Bx and By transition moments of porphyrin in the intercalation
pocket can be observed from the wavelength-dependent LDr signal (Figure 4B).
In the presence of 80% ethanol, an apparent positive magnitude was
observed in the Soret region (Figure 4A). In general, this pattern reflects that the angle
between the Bx and By transition moments of porphyrin
and the local DNA helix axis did not match with the intercalation
binding mode. In other words, the positive contributions in the LDr spectrum may be understood as a strong tilt of the transition
moment of TMPyP with respect to the DNA helix axis because of a conformational
change by 80% ethanol. The porphyrin moieties under low water activity
conditions tend to self-stack at the outside of DNA. In the DNA and
Co-TMPyP complex in an aqueous solution and ethanol–water conditions,
a wavelength-dependent signal with a much smaller magnitude than that
of the DNA absorption region was observed (Figure S3), suggesting outside stacking binding mode or that a part
of the porphyrin is conceivably bound at the groove.

Figure 4 LDr spectra
of the free TMPyP (black-colored curve)
and TMPyP complexed with DNA (red-colored curve) in an 80% ethanol
solution (A) and in an aqueous buffer solution (B). The concentrations
are the same as in Figure 1.

Analysis of the LDr Spectrum of TMPyP Bound to A-
and B-Form DNA
If there is a single electric transition moment
for a DNA-bound molecule and the binding mode is homogeneous, a wavelength-independent
LDr is expected in the molecule absorption region. The
appearance of wavelength-dependent LDr in the absorption
region of the DNA-bound molecule suggests that at least two electric
transition moments with different angles relative to the local DNA
helix axis are involved in a given absorption band. In particular,
the wavelength-dependent LDr in the Soret region of the
DNA-bound TMPyP suggests that the degeneracy of the Bx and By transitions of TMPyP is removed partially. In this
case, the LD spectrum may be analyzed by noticing that the absorption
and LD spectra are the sum of the contributions of the two electric
transition moments32,36 1   2  where T1 and T2 are the contributions of the absorption profile
of Bx and By to the absorption spectrum, and T3 and T4 are those
that contribute to the LD spectrum. The ti values are coefficients. The pure contribution of T1 can be obtained by a step-wise subtraction
of the properly tuned LD spectrum, κLD(λ), multiplied
by a weighing factor (κ), from the measured absorption spectrum
because the contribution of the two transition moments to the absorption
and LD spectra are different. 3  

This method of analysis of
the LD spectrum
has been applied occasionally to the DNA–porphyrin complexes.36,37Figure 5A shows the A(λ) – κLD(λ) spectrum of the DNA–TMPyP
complex in an aqueous solution, with κ ranging from −0.5
to −1.2 with a −0.1 increment. The measured absorption
spectrum is shown at the top of panel A. The absorption profile with
κ = −0.9 (curve b, solid curve) was chosen to be the
most representative of the short-wavelength transition, T1(λ). The subtraction of T1(λ) from the measured absorption spectrum results in T2(λ), the long-wavelength transition moment. Figure 5B presents the two
absorption spectra corresponding to Bx and By. Using a similar method, the contributions from two transition moments
for the LD spectrum were analyzed, and the resulting LD spectra are
shown in Figure 5C.

spectra, A(λ) – κLD(λ),

Soret region. The κ values were varied from −0.5 to −1.2
in −0.1 increments. The curve with κ = −0.9 (curve
b, dashed curve) is considered to represent the short-wavelength transition
(T1(λ)). The measured absorption
spectrum is denoted by curve a. (B) Absorption spectrum corresponding

The contributions from the long- and short-wavelength transition moments
are denoted by curves b and c. (C) The measured LD (curve a) and the
contribution from the long- and short-wavelength transition moments
to the LD spectrum (curves b and c). The concentrations are the same
as in Figure 1.

Once the absorption and LD spectra
are separated, LDr can be calculated from the ratio of
the corresponding absorption
and LD spectra; consequently, the angle, α, was calculated using eq 4. The angles were 45.8°
for one transition, indicating that the Bx or By transitions are strongly tilted from the DNA base plane or the local
DNA helix axis. These results are in contrast with the published data
in an aqueous environment (that is, angle for intercalation binding
mode at a low mixing ratio).38 In this
case, even in an aqueous solution, TMPyP is not fully intercalated
to DNA. According to the angle, porphyrin might be able to partially
intercalate through the minor groove of DNA. The magnitude of LD in
the Soret region decreased to a large extent in the 80% ethanol condition,
which indicates that the extent of tilt in the DNA-bound TMPyP is
larger in the aqueous buffer system. The appearance of LD of the DNA–TMPyP
complex, which is related to the binding geometry of TMPyP with respect
to DNA, is obviously different between the aqueous and ethanol–water
conditions, suggesting different binding geometry for TMPyP (data
not shown). The magnitude of LDr in the Soret region varied
significantly. In the aqueous environment, the magnitude of the DNA–TMPyP
complex in the Soret region was similar to or larger than that in
the DNA absorption region. In contrast, it increased significantly
under the 80% ethanol condition, suggesting largely deviated binding
mode from the intercalation. Figure S4A shows the A(λ) – κLD(λ)
spectrum of the DNA–TMPyP complex in 80% ethanol, with κ
ranging from −0.1 to −0.9 in −0.1 increment.
The measured absorption spectrum is shown at the top of panel A. The
absorption profile with κ = −0.5 (curve b, solid curve)
was chosen as the most representative of a short-wave transition, T1(λ). The subtraction of T1(λ) from the measured absorption spectrum results
in T2(λ), the long-wavelength transition
moment. Figure S4B shows the two absorption
spectra, corresponding to Bx and By. Using
a similar method, the contributions from two transition moments for
the LD spectrum were analyzed, and the resulting LD spectra are shown
in Figure S4C. Unfortunately, each angle
could not be analyzed for the less polar system at this stage.

Figure 6 shows the
change in the LD magnitude of TMPyP– and Co-TMPyP–DNA
complexes in the presence and absence of ethanol. Difference between
the TMPyP– and Co-TMPyP–DNA complexes in the LD spectrum
is the LD magnitude in the DNA absorption region. In the case of
both TMPyP– and Co-TMPyP–DNA complexes in an aqueous
solution, the magnitude of the LD signal at 260 nm remained with increasing
TMPyP and Co-TMPyP concentration, but it decreased significantly in
the ethanol–water system. When both porphyrins bound to the
A-form DNA, their conformation changed gradually with the increasing
concentration of porphyrins. This may be due to local changes in the
base-stacking arrangement in the ethanol environment. On the other
hand, once the B-form DNA complex formed with Co-TMPyP and TMPyP,
there was no further structural change with increasing porphyrin concentration.

Figure 6 Change
in the LD magnitude of TMPyP + B-DNA (opened circles), TMPyP
+ A-DNA (closed circles), Co-TMPyP + B-DNA (opened triangles), and
Co-TMPyP + A-DNA (closed triangles) at 260 nm with increasing porphyrin
concentration. LD (DNA-P) and LD (DNA) indicate the magnitude of LD
at 260 nm for the DNA–porphyrin complex and DNA in the absence
of porphyrin, respectively. A representative error bar, which is the
standard deviation from three measurements, is shown.

Summary
This study was performed
under low ionic strength commonly used
for studies of the B to A transition. The results suggest that TMPyP
interacts with B-DNA via intercalation at low ratios under low salt
conditions. In contrast, the interaction with A-DNA occurs in an outside
binding manner. This difference may be because the structural conformations,
such as the groove of A-DNA, are not as deep as in B-DNA and the bases
are much more tilted. In the case of Co-TMPyP, porphyrin binds preferably
with the B- and A-DNA via outside self-stacking mode. These results
may be useful in developing a rational design of porphyrin-based ligands
with predictable affinity and specificity.

Experimental Section
Materials
Calf thymus DNA (DNA) was purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich. DNA was dissolved in 1 mM sodium phosphate buffer (Na2HPO4 + NaH2PO4, pH 7) by
exhaustive shaking at 4 °C. The concentrations of DNA and TMPyP
were determined spectrophotometrically in aqueous solution using the
extinction coefficients, ε260nm = 6700 cm–1·M–1 (DNA base or phosphate) and ε424nm = 226 000 cm–1·M–1 and ε434nm = 215 000 cm–1·M–1 for TMPyP and Co-TMPyP, respectively.
All measurements were taken at ambient temperature.

Absorption
Spectroscopy and Fluorescence Spectroscopy
Absorption spectra
were recorded on a Cary 100 instrument. Fluorescence
spectroscopy was used to examine the binding characteristics between
DNA and TMPyP with a cacodylate buffer or 80% ethanol solution. Steady
state fluorescence measurements were taken using Jasco FP-8300. The
detailed experimental conditions are depicted in the figure legend.

Polarized Light Spectroscopy
The shape of the CD signal
in the DNA absorption region represents the conformation of the DNA.
It is a useful tool for tracing the transition of the B- to A-form
or vice versa. In general, the origin of the induced CD upon binding
of an achiral drug to DNA is believed to be the interaction between
the electric transition moments of the drugs and chirally arranged
electric transition moments of the DNA bases.19−22 The CD spectra were obtained
using a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter (Tokyo, Japan). LD is defined
as the difference in absorbance between radiation polarized parallel
and perpendicular and is a sensitive tool for examining the binding
properties of small molecules to native DNA and to synthetic polynucleotides.
The division of the measured LD spectrum by the isotropic absorption
spectrum results in a dimensionless quantity called reduced LD (LDr), which is related to the orientation factor (S), optical factor (O), and the angle (α) between
the electric transition moment of the ligand and the DNA helix axis
(orientation axis) through eq 4. 4  

Polarized
light spectra were averaged
over several scans when necessary.
