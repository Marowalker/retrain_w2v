We
demonstrate the use of ball milling mechanochemistry for rapid,
simple, and materials-efficient synthesis of the organic mineral paceite
CaCu(OAc)4·6H2O (where OAc– is the acetate ion), composed of coordination polymer chains containing
alternating Ca2+ and Cu2+ ions, as well as its
cadmium-based analogue CaCd(OAc)4·6H2O.
While the synthesis of paceite in aqueous solutions requires a high
excess of the copper precursor, mechanochemistry permits the use of
stoichiometric amounts of reagents, as well as the use of poorly soluble
and readily accessible calcium carbonate or hydroxide reactants. As
established by thermochemical measurements, enthalpies of formation
of both synthetic paceite and its cadmium analogue relevant to the
mechanochemical reactions are highly exothermic. Reactions can also
be conducted using accelerated aging, a synthetic technique that mimics
geological processes of mineral weathering. Accelerated aging reactivity
involving copper(II) acetate monohydrate (hoganite) and calcium carbonate
(calcite) provides a potential explanation of how complex organic
minerals like paceite could form in a geological environment.

Introduction
Over the past 10 years,
structural studies of geological samples
have identified an increasing number of organic minerals, broadly
defined as carbon-bearing mineral species other than carbonates and
carbon allotropes.1,2 Principal representatives of such
organic minerals are transition metal and lanthanide oxalates,3,4 as well as metal formates,5 mellitates,6 acetates,1,2 and organic molecules
such as uric acid.7−9 The search for organic minerals and a deeper understanding
of their structures and origins have been additionally promoted by
the recent “Carbon Mineral Challenge” initiative, which
considers organic minerals, while extremely poorly investigated, as
nevertheless central to understanding mineral evolution and carbon
cycle on Earth and other planetary systems.10,11 The vibrant investigations of organic minerals have recently led
to the structural characterization of geoporphyrins,12 discovery of naturally occurring metal–organic frameworks
(MOFs),13,14 and proposed geological appearance of organic
cocrystals15 in extraterrestrial environments
such as Titan.16

Recent additions
to the library of organic minerals are copper(II)
acetate monohydrate, Cu(OAc)2·H2O, found
as the mineral hoganite in the Potosi Mine in New South Wales (Australia),
and paceite, the related double salt of calcium copper(II) acetate
hexahydrate, CaCu(OAc)4·6H2O, found as
dark blue crystals growing on the surface of hoganite specimens.17 The minerals found in gossan were goethite,
hematite, quartz, linarite, malachite, azurite, cuprian smithsonite,
and cerussite. Gossan was located at a depth of approximately 20 m
and in the vicinity of a decomposing leaf litter, providing a potential
source of acetate ion. The structures of both minerals are unique
in the context of organic minerals, representing the first identified
acetate minerals,17 and are also of relevance
to modern metal–organic materials chemistry. In particular,
hoganite consists of the well-known copper(II) acetate “paddlewheel”
dimers (Figure 1), which are also important secondary building units in the design
and synthesis of coordination polymers and metal–organic frameworks
(MOFs).18 Calcium copper(II) acetate hexahydrate
is a synthetic compound that has been known since at least 1960,19 and its single crystal X-ray diffraction structure
was reported first by Langs and Hare in 1967,20 who described the structure without detailed crystallographic data.
The structure was subsequently redetermined by Klop et al.21 and by El-Bali and Bolte22 and consists of one-dimensional coordination polymer chains
of alternating square-coordinated copper(II) ions and hydrated octahedrally
coordinated calcium ions bridged by acetate ions. Such regular alternation
of metal ions is also of relevance for the development of metal–organic
materials based on more than one type of metal ion. In particular,
while a number of designs have recently emerged for such mixed-metal
materials,23,24 these are usually based on the
formation of solid solutions in which different metal ions are randomly
distributed over specific crystallographic sites.25 The potentially broader relevance of this structure in
metal–organic chemistry is highlighted by its cadmium- and
calcium-based analogue, CaCd(OAc)4·6H2O.
This compound was described by Balarew and Stoilova,26 as well as by Langs and Hare, who also conducted structural
characterization.20 The compound was reported
to be isomorphous to CaCu(OAc)4·6H2O, but detailed crystallographic information
was never provided.

Consequently, we recognized paceite
and its synthetic cadmium analogues
as excellent targets for our ongoing investigation of the properties
and potential origin of naturally occurring metal–organic materials.13,27 Specifically, we targeted the structure, thermal, and thermodynamic
stability of synthetic paceite and its cadmium analogue, as well as
potential routes through which such materials could assemble from
geologically relevant precursors, via mechanochemical28 or accelerated aging29 reactions.

Experimental
Section
Mechanochemical syntheses were conducted using either
a Retsch
MM200 mixer mill operating at 25 Hz or a Form-Tech Scientific 1000
shaker mill operating at 30 Hz. All reactions were performed using
stainless steel milling media, including a milling jar of 15 mL volume
equipped with two milling balls of 7 mm diameter (1.37 g each). A
detailed mechanochemical reaction procedure for each compound is given
in the Supporting Information.

Differential
scanning calorimetry coupled with thermogravimetric
analysis (DSC-TG) was performed on a Netzsch 449 instrument to determine
the water content of the samples. In each experiment, the samples
were heated from 25 to 800 °C under an O2 atmosphere
(heating rate 10 °C/min, platinum crucible).

Fourier transform
infrared attenuated total reflectance (FTIR-ATR)
spectra were obtained using a Bruker Platinum ATR spectrometer.

In situ PXRD monitoring of aging reactions was performed on a PROTO
AXRD Benchtop diffractometer equipped with a DECTRIS Mythen 1K strip
detector. Data were collected using a custom designed sample holder.30 A homogenized mixture of Ca(OH)2 and
Cu(OAc)2·H2O was placed in the middle,
and 200 mL of 50% aqueous solution (by volume) of acetic acid was
placed in the sample holder grooves. Consecutive powder diffractograms
were collected over the course of 12 h with a time resolution of 5
min and 50 s between scans. Rietveld fitting was performed in the
TOPAZ6 analytical program.31

Single
crystal X-ray diffraction data were collected on a Bruker
D8 Advance diffractometer with a Photon 200 CMOS area detector and
an IμS microfocus X-ray source (Madison, WI) using Mo Kα
radiation. The single crystal was coated with paraffin oil, and data
were collected at room temperature. The Apex3 software suite (Madison,
WI) was used for data collection, reduction, and unit cell assignment.

The enthalpy of dissolution of the samples was measured using a
CSC (Calorimetry Sciences Corporation) 4400 isothermal microcalorimeter
at 25 °C. In each experiment, 5–15 mg of the sample was
hand-pressed to form a pellet and dropped into a Teflon cell in the
calorimeter filled with 25 g of 5 N HCl solvent. All weight measurements
were done using a Mettler microbalance with an accuracy of 10 μg.
The solvent was isothermally equilibrated for at least 3 h under mechanical
stirring before the introduction of the sample, and the sample was
allowed to dissolve in the cell for at least 3 h, ensuring the return
of baseline back to the initial position. For each experiment, the
solvent in the cell was replaced with a new fresh solvent. The collected
data were integrated with a baseline correction and converted to joules
using a calibration factor to obtain the total heat effect due to
the dissolution of the sample. To obtain the calibration factor, the
NIST standard reference material KCl was used. The calibration was
done by dissolving 15 mg of KCl pellet into 25 g of H2O,
which corresponds to a reference concentration of 0.008 mol/kg at
25 °C. The calibration factor was obtained by correlating the
integrated data with a known enthalpy of dissolution and dilution
of 0.008 mol/kg KCl. For each sample, at least four measurements were
performed, and their average was reported as the final value. The
uncertainties given in the result represent 95% confidence interval.
This experimental method is the same as the one used in our earlier
study of metal–organic frameworks.32

Results and Discussion
Mechanochemical Synthesis of Synthetic Paceite
and Its Cadmium
Analogue
Synthesis of artificial paceite from water was described
in 1960 by Holden and Singer using copper(II) acetate monohydrate
and calcium acetate as starting materials.19 The synthesis is a textbook example of noncongruent cocrystallization,
as the aqueous solubility of calcium acetate is significantly higher
than that of Cu(OAc)2·H2O, which requires the two components to be used in
a non-stoichiometric approximately 4:1 ratio. Mechanochemistry by
ball milling has been demonstrated to provide access to solubility-independent
reactions in which the stoichiometric composition of the product can
be readily controlled by the composition of the reaction mixture.33,34 Such stoichiometry control was observed for mechanochemistry by
neat (dry) milling, as well as by liquid-assisted grinding (LAG),
a methodology that uses a small amount of a liquid phase (measured
in the form of η, the ratio of liquid additive to reactant weight)
to enable and accelerate mechanochemical reactions.32 Consequently, we decided to explore whether mechanochemistry
can be used to obtain synthetic paceite samples using stoichiometric
amounts of Cu2+ and Ca2+ precursors.

For
that purpose and with the intention to explore potential routes through
which paceite could be formed in a geological environment, we envisaged
a two-step synthetic protocol that would use mineral-like substances
as precursors. We chose copper(II) acetate monohydrate, Cu(OAc)2·H2O, as a source of Cu2+ ions,
while the calcium acetate material required for the synthesis would
be obtained in a mechanochemical reaction of either CaCO3 or Ca(OH)2 in combination with acetic acid (AcOH) (reactions 1 and 2). The resulting hydrated calcium acetate was then expected
to form paceite in a mechanochemical reaction with 1 equiv of Cu(OAc)2·H2O (reaction 3). 1   2   3  

All mechanochemical reactions were performed by the LAG methodology35 using a small amount of water as an additive
(typically 10–12 μL, see the Supporting Information), and analysis of reactants by PXRD confirmed that
the used CaCO3 was in the calcite form. The LAG reactions
of either Ca(OH)2 or CaCO3 with a small excess
(under 5 mol %) of glacial acetic acid led to the formation of calcium
acetate monohydrate as the sole crystalline product. In particular,
milling 0.5 mmol of Ca(OH)2 for 30 min with 60 μL
of AcOH and 10 μL of water led to the complete disappearance
of the solid reactant and formation of hydrated calcium acetate of
the formula Ca(OAc)2·H2O (CSD code CEJLIM),
identified by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) (Figure 2, also see the Supporting Information).
In contrast, complete conversion of CaCO3 into Ca(OAc)2·H2O required 80 min of milling on the 1 mmol
scale (see the Supporting Information).
Shorter milling times revealed the formation of a mixed hydrate and
acetic acid solvate of calcium acetate, of composition Ca(OAc)2·H2O·AcOH, which was identified by PXRD
reflections matching those simulated for the published structure (CSD
code COKJUH), along with unreacted CaCO3. Upon longer milling,
the initially formed Ca(OAc)2·H2O·AcOH
reacted with remaining CaCO3 to provide Ca(OAc)2·H2O (Figure 3).

Figure 2 Comparison of PXRD patterns for Ca(OAc)2·H2O mechanochemically prepared from Ca(OH)2 or CaCO3 and for samples of CaCu(OAc)4·6H2O (synthetic paceite) prepared in a one- or two-step mechanochemical
procedure to corresponding patterns of starting materials and simulated
patterns of targeted products.

Figure 3 Overlay of PXRD patterns for Ca(OAc)2·H2O·AcOH mechanochemically synthesized from Ca(OH)2 or CaCO3 to relevant patterns of reactants and simulated
patterns.

In the next step, 1 equiv of Cu(OAc)2·H2O was added to the mechanochemically prepared
Ca(OAc)2·H2O and the reaction mixture was
milled for an additional
30 min. Analysis by PXRD revealed the complete disappearance of Bragg
reflections of the starting materials and appearance of new reflections
consistent with the diffraction pattern calculated for the crystal
structure of paceite. Identical outcomes were obtained regardless
of whether the Ca2+ source in this two-step process was
calcium carbonate or hydroxide (Figure 2). The formation of the paceite structure was also
possible in a one-pot one-step process by milling calcium carbonate
or hydroxide and acetic acid in the presence of equimolar amounts
of Cu(OAc)2·H2O and water. After 30 min
of milling, the PXRD pattern of the reaction mixture exhibited only
X-ray reflections of the mixed coordination polymer CuCa(OAc)4·6H2O (Figure 2). The formation of paceite by both one- and two-step
mechanochemical routes was also confirmed by Fourier transform infrared
attenuated total reflectance (FTIR-ATR) spectra, which were identical
for the products of both synthetic methods (see the Supporting Information).

The described two-step and
one-step mechanochemical routes to CuCa(OAc)4·6H2O clearly demonstrate that the synthesis
of this material can be readily performed through LAG using only stoichiometric
amounts of metal precursors.

Stoichiometric Control in Mechanochemical
Synthesis of Calcium
Acetate Solvates
The observed formation of Ca(OAc)2·H2O·AcOH as an intermediate in the mechanochemical
synthesis of Ca(OAc)2·H2O from CaCO3 is consistent with previously reported formation of highly
solvated compounds as intermediates in mechanochemical synthesis of
coordination compounds and MOFs.36−38 It also suggests the
possibility for selective synthesis of different solvates of calcium
acetate, Ca(OAc)2·H2O or Ca(OAc)2·H2O·AcOH, depending on the stoichiometric composition of the reaction mixture.
Specifically, we speculated that simply using the calcium-based precursor
and acetic acid in the respective stoichiometric ratio of 1:3 should
enable the selective formation of Ca(OAc)2·H2O·AcOH. Indeed, milling of 1 mmol of Ca(OH)2 with
3 mmol of AcOH led to the complete disappearance of Bragg reflections
of the solid reactant in the PXRD pattern of the reaction mixture
and the appearance of reflections of Ca(OAc)2·H2O·AcOH (Figure 3). The formation of Ca(OAc)2·H2O·AcOH was also verified by TGA. Similarly, milling of CaCO3 with 3 equiv of AcOH led to quantitative conversion within
60 min of milling. Energetic constraints on these reactions and observed
intermediates are discussed below from the point of view of thermochemical
data.

The demonstrated ability to selectively obtain either
Ca(OAc)2·H2O·AcOH or Ca(OAc)2·H2O provides an additional illustration of the effectiveness
of mechanochemical methods in controlling the stoichiometric composition
of products.

Formation of Paceite by Accelerated Aging:
A Potential Route
for Geochemical Synthesis
The formation of paceite by two-step
or one-step milling reaction of CaCO3 and Cu(OAc)2·H2O, both of which are known mineral species, suggests
a possible geochemical route to paceite either through mechanical
impact39 or through mineral weathering
reactions. In order to explore this possibility, we conducted accelerated
aging reactions40 inspired by mineral weathering
processes41 in which the exposure of inorganic
minerals to small organic molecules under suitable conditions of temperature
and atmosphere leads to the formation of organic minerals.

Two
designs of accelerated aging reactions were explored. In one design,
the reaction mixtures of either Ca(OH)2 or CaCO3 with 1 equiv of Cu(OAc)2·H2O were manually
mixed, followed by addition of a slight excess (10 mol %) of liquid
AcOH, and then left to age for 7 days in 100% relative humidity (100%
RH, i.e., saturated water vapor). In the second reaction design, the
mixtures of Cu(OAc)2·2H2O with either CaCO3 or Ca(OH)2 as the calcium source were left to
age for 7 days in an atmosphere saturated by vapors of a 50% aqueous
solution of acetic acid (v/v). The reactions were conducted either
at room temperature or in an incubator set to 45 °C. Visual observation
of reaction mixtures over time in most cases revealed partial deliquescence
and change in reaction mixture color to blue, consistent with paceite
formation (Figure 4). The exceptions were reactions in which mixtures of Cu(OAc)2·H2O with CaCO3 or Ca(OH)2 were left to age in
vapors of the 50%
aqueous acetic acid solution. Even after 7 days, these mixtures clearly
consisted of a white powder with dispersed dark green particles of
the Cu(OAc)2·H2O reactant.

Figure 4 Optical images of equimolar
mixtures of Cu(OAc)2·H2O and either Ca(OH)2 or CaCO3 upon 6
days of aging under different conditions: (a) Cu(OAc)2·H2O and Ca(OH)2 with 1.1 equiv of AcOH added directly
to the mixture and aged at 100% RH and 45 °C; (b) Cu(OAc)2·H2O and Ca(OH)2 with 1.1 equiv
of AcOH added directly to the mixture and aged at 100% RH and room
temperature; (c) Cu(OAc)2·H2O and Ca(OH)2 aged in vapors of 50% aqueous AcOH at 45 °C; (d) Cu(OAc)2·H2O and Ca(OH)2 aged in vapors
of 50% aqueous AcOH at room temperature; (e) Cu(OAc)2·H2O and CaCO3 with 1.1 equiv of AcOH added directly
to the mixture and aged at 100% RH and 45 °C; (f) Cu(OAc)2·H2O and CaCO3 with 1.1 equiv of
AcOH added directly to the mixture and aged at 100% RH and room temperature;
(g) Cu(OAc)2·H2O and CaCO3 aged in vapors of 50% aqueous AcOH at 45 °C;
(h) Cu(OAc)2·H2O and CaCO3 aged
in vapors of 50% aqueous AcOH at room temperature.

The visual observations are confirmed by PXRD analysis
of the aged
reaction mixtures (Figure 5), which were briefly manually ground before recording a diffractogram.
The analysis revealed the formation of the paceite structure in all
experiments, except in the aforementioned reactions of aging in vapors
of 50% aqueous AcOH solution (v/v) at room temperature. Importantly,
while reaction mixtures exhibited deliquescence, in no case was complete
dissolution of samples observed.

Figure 5 PXRD patterns for mixtures of Cu(OAc)2·H2O with either Ca(OH)2 or CaCO3 after 7 days
of aging under different conditions compared to simulated patterns
of CaCu(OAc)4·6H2O, Ca(OAc)2·H2O, and Ca(OAc)2·H2O·AcOH. Reactions
were kept either at 45
°C or at room temperature.

In addition to paceite, the reaction mixtures also exhibited
X-ray
reflections consistent with different amounts of Ca(OAc)2·H2O or Ca(OAc)2·H2O·AcOH. The observation
that both of these
phases participate in the solid-state formation of paceite was verified
by real-time monitoring of the reaction of Cu(OAc)2·H2O with Ca(OH)2 in an atmosphere containing vapors
of water and AcOH. An analogous measurement was not possible for CaCO3 as the calcium source due to formation of the gaseous CO2 in the reaction. A detailed description of the experimental
setup and its use in monitoring cocrystal formation have been recently
published.30,42

Real-time in situ X-ray
diffraction monitoring of changes in a
mixture of equimolar amounts of Ca(OH)2 and Cu(OAc)2·H2O upon exposure
to vapors of acetic acid and water revealed (Figure 6) the interconversion of at least five crystalline
phases: Ca(OH)2, Cu(OAc)2·H2O, paceite, calcium acetate monohydrate (CSD code CEJLIM), and Ca(OAc)2·H2O·AcOH (CSD code COKJUH). Rietveld refinement of in situ PXRD data revealed
a continuous drop in the content of Ca(OH)2 and Cu(OAc)2·H2O reactants over approximately 14 h. The
first new crystalline phase observed in the reaction is the mixed
hydrate and acetic acid solvate Ca(OAc)2·H2O·AcOH, which is detected
already in the first experimental data sets. The crystalline monohydrate
Ca(OAc)2·H2O appears considerably later
in the reaction, after approximately 3.5 h of aging, and is soon followed
by the appearance of the paceite structure after approximately 5 h
of aging. The initial formation of Ca(OAc)2·H2O·AcOH, followed by Ca(OAc)2·H2O, is consistent with previous general observations on mechanochemical
reactions of oxides with carboxylic acids, which reveal the initial
formation of the more solvated intermediate phases.

Figure 6 (a) Time-resolved X-ray
powder diffractogram for the aging reaction
of Ca(OH)2 and Cu(OAc)2·H2O
in an atmosphere of water and acetic acid and (b) corresponding reaction
profile based on Rietveld refinement of the PXRD data.

Rietveld analysis suggests that the disappearance
of Ca(OH)2 takes place faster
than that of
Cu(OAc)2·H2O. While quantitative analysis
is hindered by significant potential for preferred orientation and
crystal size effects in such a nonmixed reaction system, these observations
may be explained by multiple possible reaction pathways available
for calcium hydroxide, forming three different calcium-containing
products, in contrast to copper(II) acetate converting only to paceite.

Cadmium Analogue of Paceite
We next explored the potential
to use analogous reactivity to synthesize the previously reported
cadmium analogue of paceite.20 Indeed,
the two-step mechanochemical reactions involving milling of Ca(OH)2 or CaCO3 in the presence of a small excess of
acetic acid, followed by milling of resulting Ca(OAc)2·H2O with commercially available Cd(OAc)2·2H2O, led to the quantitative formation of the targeted CaCd(OAc)4·6H2O paceite analogue (Figure 7). Formation of CaCd(OAc)4·6H2O was verified by PXRD pattern analysis, which revealed a
product isostructural to paceite. As observed in the case of synthetic
paceite, its cadmium analogue could also be obtained by a one-pot
mechanochemical procedure starting from either CaCO3 or
Ca(OH)2 in the presence of commercial Cd(OAc)2·2H2O, acetic acid, and a small amount of water.
Again, the formation of CaCd(OAc)4·6H2O
was confirmed by PXRD analysis (Figure 7), as well as TGA (see the Supporting Information). In this case also, the formation of the same
product by both one- and two-step mechanochemical routes was confirmed
by FTIR-ATR spectroscopy (see the Supporting Information).

Figure 7 Comparison of PXRD patterns for CaCd(OAc)4·6H2O prepared from Ca(OH)2 or CaCO3 in
a one- or two-step mechanochemical procedure to corresponding patterns
of starting materials and simulated patterns of targeted products.

As the crystallographic data for
CaCd(OAc)4·6H2O have previously not been
reported, we also conducted a single
crystal X-ray diffraction study of the structure of this mixed-metal
coordination polymer (Table 1). Single crystals for CaCd(OAc)4·6H2O were obtained through an accelerated aging process from a deliquescent
mixture of equimolar amounts of Ca(OH)2, Cd(OAc)2·2H2O, and a small excess (10%) of acetic acid that
was aged over 2 days at 45 °C and 100% RH.

Crystal structure analysis
revealed coordination polymer chains
of alternating Cd2+ and Ca2+ ions propagating
along the 41-screw axis parallel to the crystallographic c-axis (Figure 8). The chains are isostructural to those of copper(II)- and
calcium-based chains found in paceite.

Figure 8 CaCd(OAc)4·6H2O crystal structure viewed
along the 41 screw axis parallel to the crystallographic c-direction: (a) highlighting the hydrogen-bonded (H2O)12 cluster situated between four bimetallic coordination
polymer chains and (b) similar orientation of the structure, with
metal coordination polyhedra outlined (Cd: yellow, Ca: green). For
clarity, the disorder of the acetate ion is not shown.

Similar to paceite, Ca2+ ions adopt
an octahedral coordination
geometry involving four equatorial acetate ions. However, in the CaCd(OAc)4·6H2O structure, the oxygen atom of each acetate
ion associated with a Ca2+ ion was found to be disordered
over two sites, whose relative occupational parameters were established
as 0.51 and 0.49 using least-squares refinement. The disorder gives
rise to two Ca···O distances of 2.31 and 2.33 Å,
respectively. As in the paceite structure, each acetate ion forms
a bridge to one of the two nearest-neighbor Cd2+ ions in
a chain (Cd···O distance 2.29 Å). The apical coordination
positions on each Ca2+ ion are occupied by oxygen atoms
of two water molecule ligands (Ca···O distances 2.34
Å). Also analogous to Cu2+ ions, the Cd2+ ions in the structure of CaCd(OAc)4·6H2O adopt a roughly square-planar coordination geometry (O···Cd···O
angle 90.7°), established through four monodentate oxygen ligands,
each coming from a different acetate ion, which is also associated
with a nearest-neighbor Ca2+ ion.

Each of the two
water ligands on a Ca2+ ion also acts
as a hydrogen bond donor to two neighboring water molecules (O–H···O
distance 2.77 Å), which are further hydrogen-bonded to their
symmetry-related counterparts (O–H···O separation
2.78 Å) across a 41-screw axis to form 12-membered
cages based on O–H···O hydrogen bonds.

Enthalpies
of Formation of Paceite Structures and Thermodynamic
Driving Force for the Mechanochemical and Aging Formation of Paceite
Structures from CaCO3
In order to achieve deeper
insight into the formation of paceite and its cadmium analogue from
calcium carbonate, we evaluated the enthalpies of formation (ΔHf) for both CaCu(OAc)4·6H2O and CaCd(OAc)4·6H2O using acid
dissolution calorimetry43 in 5 N aqueous
hydrochloric acid as the solvent. For this purpose, dissolution enthalpies
for both CaCu(OAc)4·6H2O and CaCd(OAc)4·6H2O, as well as for Cu(OAc)2·H2O, Cd(OAc)2·2H2O, calcium acetate
hydrate, Ca(OAc)2·H2O·AcOH, and CaCO3, were experimentally determined at 25 °C. The details
of experiments and collected thermodynamic data are provided in the Supporting Information, and a summary of the
data is given in Table 2. Together with measured and literature values for the dissolution
enthalpies of glacial acetic acid and water, these measurements enabled
the evaluation of ΔHf for CaCu(OAc)4·6H2O and CaCd(OAc)4·6H2O from reacting the
corresponding transition
metal acetates either with CaCO3 and acetic acid or with
hydrated calcium acetate, following reactions 4–7. The sample
of hydrated calcium acetate used in calorimetric measurements was
found to contain a slight excess of water, corresponding to the overall
formula of Ca(OAc)2·1.1H2O, which was then used instead of the ideal composition
Ca(OAc)2·H2O for thermodynamic calculations
of reactions 5 and 7. 4   5   6   7

f Calculated
from dilution enthalpy
of HCl.45 The error is two standard deviations
of the mean; the values in brackets are the numbers of experiments
performed.

The measurement
of enthalpies of dissolution also enabled the calculation
of ΔHf for CaCu(OAc)4·6H2O and CaCd(OAc)4·6H2O from hydrated calcium acetate, in a process
corresponding to the second step of the herein reported two-step mechanochemical
synthesis starting from either CaCO3 or Ca(OH)2. In this case also, the formation of copper(II)- and cadmium-based
paceite structures was clearly exothermic, which agrees with the ease
of forming CaCu(OAc)4·6H2O and CaCd(OAc)4·6H2O by mechanochemical milling of corresponding
metal acetates. The ΔHf values for
the formation of CaCu(OAc)4·6H2O and CaCd(OAc)4·6H2O from Ca(OAc)2·H2O are more exothermic than values when starting from CaCO3, which might be related to the high stability of the carbonate
ion in the reactant.

The measured thermodynamic data also reveal
that the ΔHf for the formation of
synthetic paceite is
in each case more exothermic than for its cadmium-based analogue,
indicating a destabilization effect introduced by the incorporation
of cadmium. The other important distinction is that the reference
states for the formation reactions of CaCu(OAc)4·6H2O and CaCd(OAc)4·6H2O are not identical,
as well as that the crystal structures of the starting materials Cu(OAc)2·H2O and Cd(OAc)2·2H2O are different and have different water contents.

Tentatively,
the difference in ΔHf for synthetic
paceite and its cadmium analogue might be attributed
to the difference in the change of transition metal coordination during
the reaction: in the Cu(OAc)2·H2O starting
material, the Cu2+ ions are five-coordinated with oxygen-based
ligands, whereas in Cd(OAc)2·2H2O, the
Cd2+ ions adopt a coordination number of 7.46,47 However, in CaCu(OAc)4·6H2O and CaCd(OAc)4·6H2O, the transition
metal ions adopt a coordination number of 4. Consequently, cadmium
ions undergo a more significant change in coordination number upon
transformation into the paceite structure compared to copper(II) ions.20 Such a difference might be a significant factor
contributing to a diminished exothermic enthalpy of formation of CaCd(OAc)4·6H2O compared
to synthetic paceite.

An energy diagram explaining the reaction
steps that occur during
the formation of CaCu(OAc)4·6H2O is given
in Figure 9. It is
drawn to conserve mass in all the reactions; thus, excess acetic acid
and carbon dioxide appear in the final products together with the
paceite. The top diagram shows the reaction steps when CaCO3 is first milled with acetic acid to form Ca(OAc)2·H2O·AcOH, followed by formation of Ca(OAc)2·1.1H2O, which is then followed
by subsequent milling with Cu(OAc)2·H2O
to form paceite. Formation of the first intermediate Ca(OAc)2·H2O·AcOH was seen after short milling times,
and the ease of this reaction is supported here by the exothermic
enthalpy change (−16.62 ± 0.23 kJ/mol). The formation
of Ca(OAc)2·1.1H2O is accompanied by an
endothermic enthalpy change (20.94 ± 0.35 kJ/mol), which results
in an intermediate that has higher energy than the reactants. The
highly endothermic enthalpy is consistent with longer milling times
required for the synthesis of calcium acetate monohydrate and with
the loss of CO2 gas or other volatile reaction components,
where a large positive entropy can compensate for the positive enthalpy
to make the overall reaction favorable in free energy. The last step
of paceite formation from Ca(OAc)2·1.1H2O is accompanied by a strong exothermic enthalpy change of −31.45
± 0.25 kJ/mol.

Figure 9 Energy diagram for the formation reaction of CaCu(OAc)2·6H2O from CaCO3 and Cu(OAc)2·H2O by considering the participation of either
(a)
both intermediates or (b) one intermediate. Each step corresponds
to one of the following compositions: (1) Cu(OAc)2·H2O(s) + CaCO3(s) + 3AcOH(l) + 4H2O(l); (2) Cu(OAc)2·H2O(s) + Ca(OAc)2·H2O·AcOH(s) + CO2(g) + 4H2O(l); (2*) Cu(OAc)2·H2O(s) +
Ca(OAc)2·1.1H2O(s) + CO2(g) + AcOH(l) + 3.9H2O(l); (3) CuCa(OAc)4·6H2O(s) +
AcOH(l) + CO2(g).

Comparison of the formation of paceite directly from either
of
the intermediates can be seen in the bottom diagram in Figure 9. There, the black line indicates
the formation through the Ca(OAc)2·H2O·AcOH
intermediate, while the blue line indicates the formation through
the Ca(OAc)2·1.1H2O intermediate. It can
be seen that the Ca(OAc)2·1.1H2O intermediate
has higher enthalpy than the bulk reactants, compared to the other
intermediate that has lower enthalpy than the reactants. The formation
of Ca(OAc)2·1.1H2O is accompanied by a
small positive enthalpy change of 4.32 ± 0.27 kJ/mol. Based on
these two figures, the pathway with the formation of Ca(OAc)2·H2O·AcOH appears to be the more favorable one
because the intermediate lies energetically between the reactants
and the products, slightly closer to the products. The reactions proceed
toward lower energy and more stable forms, where the first reaction
step forming the intermediate is accompanied by an enthalpy change
of −16.62 ± 0.23 kJ/mol and
the subsequent step of paceite formation is accompanied by an
enthalpy change of −10.51 ± 0.20 kJ/mol.

Analogous
diagrams for the cadmium analogue of paceite are given
in Figure 10. The
intermediates also have the same energy as previously, because their
formation does not depend on the presence of copper(II) or cadmium
acetate. In the bottom diagram, an interesting behavior is observed.
The product has essentially the same enthalpy as the Ca(OAc)2·H2O·AcOH intermediate or perhaps slightly higher. The formation reaction
of the product from Ca(OAc)2·H2O·AcOH
is accompanied by an enthalpy change of 0.48 ± 0.29 kJ/mol, that
is, essentially zero. Thus, while Ca(OAc)2·H2O·AcOH is indeed an intermediate in enthalpy between reactants
and products in the case of CaCu(OAc)4·6H2O, for CaCd(OAc)4·6H2O it appears to be essentially the same in enthalpy as the final product.
The reason for this difference is not yet clear.

formation reaction of CaCd(OAc)2·6H2O from
CaCO3 and Cd(OAc)2·2H2O by considering
the participation of either
(a) both intermediates or (b) one intermediate. Each step corresponds
to one of the following compositions: (1) Cd(OAc)2·2H2O(s) + CaCO3(s) + 3AcOH(l) + 3H2O(l); (2) Cd(OAc)2·2H2O(s) + Ca(OAc)2·H2O·AcOH(s) + CO2(g) + 3H2O(l); (2*) Cd(OAc)2·2H2O(s) +

Conclusions
We have demonstrated the use of mechanochemistry
for the rapid,
simple, and materials-efficient preparation of synthetic samples of
the organic mineral paceite and its cadmium analogue, CaCd(OAc)4·6H2O. Importantly, while the synthesis of
synthetic paceite from aqueous solutions containing copper(II) acetate
and calcium acetate requires the use of an approximately 4-fold excess
of the calcium reagent, mechanochemistry permits the synthesis of
this material using only stoichiometric amounts of metal precursors.
Furthermore, the use of mechanochemical techniques also permitted
the use of readily available calcium hydroxide or carbonate as a source
of Ca2+, which would be difficult to achieve using simple
solution-based chemistry. Consequently, the described mechanochemical
approaches illustrate the benefits of ball milling mechanochemistry
in improving the control over product stoichiometry in the synthesis
of coordination polymers based on two different types of metal centers
and in expanding the scope of starting materials in such syntheses
to poorly soluble solids. At the same time, these syntheses of synthetic
paceite illustrate a poorly explored, but fast, simple, and efficient
route for making synthetic samples of organic minerals. This is expected
to be of high value for studies of very rare mineral species, such
as hoganite, paceite, and other organic minerals. The exploration
of mechanochemical reactivity also led to hints at how analogous reactions
could take place in a non-agitated system by aging of reactant mixtures
at high humidity and mild temperature. Such accelerated aging experiments,
which mimic mineral weathering processes in a geological environment,
provide a potential route for the formation of organic minerals. Importantly,
thermodynamic studies based on acid dissolution calorimetry confirm
that the mechanochemical syntheses of synthetic paceite and analogous
aging reactions, involving known mineral species Cu(OAc)2·H2O (hoganite) and CaCO3 (calcite), are
highly exothermic. It is expected that the exothermic nature of such
transformations provides sufficient driving force for the formation
of paceite in a natural environment. We are currently investigating
the use of mechanochemistry for the synthesis of synthetic samples
of other known organic minerals.
