Herein, a protocol strategy has been designed for the
preparation
of ternary silver nanoparticles-supported polyaniline multiwalled
carbon nanotube (Ag NPs–PANI/MWCNT) nanocomposites with a chemical
interaction for catalytic and antibacterial activity. The morphological
study confirmed that Ag NPs were immobilized on the surface of PANI,
and afterward, Ag NPs–PANI were mixed with the MWCNTs. The
X-ray diffraction technique revealed the face-centered cubic structure
of Ag NPs, and the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy study revealed
the chemical constituent and signature of π–π*
and C–N interactions in the nanocomposites. The ternary Ag
NPs–PANI/MWCNTs nanocomposites have the apparent rate of reaction
(Kapp) as 5.4 × 10–3 s–1, higher than binary nanocomposites for catalytic
reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol at room temperature. Antibacterial
activity of Ag NPs–PANI/MWCNT nanocomposites is higher against
pathogenic bacteria. Thereafter, because of multifold applications
of ternary nanocomposites, they have a broad scope in the field of
environmental and healthcare sectors.

1 Introduction
In recent times, energy
exploitation, environmental remediation,
and multiresistance bacteria have attracted extensive concern globally.
Hence, investigators are continuously trying their level best with
the search of smart materials for a wide variety of applications.1 Noble metal Ag nanoparticles (NPs) are potential
candidates used commonly in catalysis, antibacterials, and sensors
because of their excellent optical, catalytic, and antimicrobial properties
which depend on size, shape, composition, and structures.2,3 Particularly, Ag NPs have a tendency to aggregate because of high
surface energy and subsequently lose their catalytic activity. Therefore,
to enhance properties as well as stability, there is a need to make
its composites with other. To conquer these problems, Ag NPs are incorporated
into solid supports such as metal oxides,4 polymers,5 carbonous materials,6 and biomaterials.7 Among the various supportive materials, conducting polymer is most
suitable material because it owes intermolecular interaction to upgrade
optical and electrical properties resulting in the effective use into
enzymatic and nonenzymatic sensors, actuators capacitors, catalysis,
electronic devices, fuel cells.8,9 Polyaniline (PANI) is
one of the cheapest, easily accessible, environmentally stable, easily
separable, and best supporting polymer material which is insoluble
in organic solvents.10 In addition, the
PANI polymer has been enhancing the rate of the host materials for
catalytic and antibacterial activity. Shaban et al. reported the nanoporous
Ag NPs−PANI nanocomposite prepared by using the oxidation route
and utilized it as an antibacterial agent.11 The silver–PANI (Ag NPs–PANI) nanocomposite synthesis
protocol is time-consuming, and it shows antibacterial activity against
the only B. substilis pathogenic bacteria.12 Heterogeneous (Ag NPs–PANI) nanocomposites were prepared with an
optimized morphology using a higher pressure and temperature method,
which was a tedious process.13 Sophisticated
instruments are used for the preparation of the nanocomposite, but
a microscopic study revealed that silver is not well distributed on
the surface of the PANI nanocomposites.14 However, the efficiency of Ag NPs–PANI in the various applications
is not up to the mark, and hence, it is necessary to modify the Ag
NPs–PANI for further research endeavors. Nowadays, carbon-based
materials such as graphene, activated carbon, and carbon nanotubes
(CNTs) have been used in the areas of the fuel cells, sensors, catalysis,
and capacitors. Among the various carbon nanostructures, CNTs are
a promising candidate for hybrid nanocomposites because of their large
surface area, incredible electronic characteristics, and good structural
and mechanical properties.15 The nanofibrous
structures of CNTs have excellent cell adherence and efficient electrostatic
interaction with the cell membrane compared to other structures. In
addition, generations of reactive oxygen species have affected biological
molecules and led to DNA destruction. The insertion of impurities
in multiwalled CNTs (MWCNTs) possesses optimized antibacterial activities.
One-dimensional CNTs and zero-dimensional Ag NPs can also promote
the antibacterial as well as catalytic activity.16 Wen et al. reported that a polyacrylonitrile PANI silver
nanowires–carbon fiber cloth composite membrane filter is a
better disinfectant.17 Hybrid PANI/graphene/CNT
nanocomposites are used in water disinfection, but the overall synthesis
protocol is tedious.18 Zhang et al. reported
that carbon nanofibers/Ag NPs efficiently reduce 4-nitrophenol (4-NP)
because of the high surface area and electron transfer between CNFs
and Ag NPs.19 Though uniform distribution,
adsorption capability and electron migration of graphene to silver
results the effective catalyst for reduction of 4-NP, however a rate
constant for the said conversion is not up to the mark than others.20 In addition, the optimized synthetic protocol
of Fe3O4@SiO2@Au–PANI is complicated,
even though it reduces the aggregation of silica particles and is
employed for the catalytic activity.21 Micro-
and nanostructured PANI–Ag composites have been prepared using
nitric acid which is employed for the catalytic study, but the use
of acid is not an environmentally benign method.22 However, the individual metals, polymers, as well as carbon-based
materials due to their unique properties are used in various applications
individually, but the major challenge is to tailor their properties
successfully for antibacterial as well as catalysis application. In
consequence of that, there is an urgency to design materials with
low-cost preparation and synergistic properties of all individual
elements for both applications. The synergy of these materials would
result in the enhanced properties of individual bare materials. The
ternary Ag NP–PANI/MWCNT composite has been designed by the
wet chemical method, and it is used for its catalytic and antibacterial
activity. To the best of our knowledge, the optical, structural, catalytic,
as well as antibacterial properties of Ag NPs–PANI/MWCNT composite
are obscure.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 UV–Visible Spectroscopy
The
absorption peak at 270 nm is attributed to F-MWCNTs as shown in Figure S1a. For PANI, the absorption bands are
found at 566 nm which are attributed to the π–π*
transition due to the quinonoid, as shown in Figure S1b. Ag NPs–PANI showed a broad absorption band at 375
nm, which signifies a surface plasmon resonance band of Ag NPs because
of the absorption of an electron from the conduction band of silver
as shown in Figure 1a.23 The absorption band of Ag NPs–PANI/MWCNTs
showed two distinct peaks at 340 and 600 nm, as shown in Figure 1b. The longer shift
of the peak is observed from 331 to 370 nm because of the presence
of silver nanoparticles in binary nanocomposites. Furthermore, the
peaks observed are shifted from 331 to 340 nm because of the presence
of silver and CNT reduction of slight shift of the absorption peak
of the benzonoid ring.24

NPs–PANI/MWCNTs.

2.2 Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
Figure 2b shows
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of pure PANI, Ag NPs–PANI,
and Ag NPs–PANI/MWCNT nanocomposites. The characteristic peak
of pure PANI is at 1480 and 1630 cm–1 of C=C
stretching of benzenoid and quinonoid rings, respectively. Particular
bands are observed at 1292 and 1236 cm–1 which represent
C–N stretching of benzenoid and quinonoid rings. In addition,
bands found at 2924 and 2855 cm–1 indicated hydrogen
bonding, and two benzene nuclei shown at 2355 cm–1 and out-of-plane bending C–H vibration at 806 cm–1 was observed because of the p-substituted benzene
ring.25 The distinctive band centered at
668 cm–1 corresponds to the C–S stretching
of the benzenoid ring of para-toluene sulphonic acid
(p-TSA). The peak of the N–H vibration has
been shifted from 3450 to 3420 cm–1. This red shift
is the significance of the conjugated electron cloud among Ag NPs
and PANI and MWCNT chains.26 The specific
peak at 1137 cm–1 with an increase in intensity
indicates the N=Q=N band which has a strong interaction
between the quinoid ring of PANI and the π-bonded outer part
of the MWCNTs.27 In the Ag NPs–PANI/MWCNT
nanocomposites, a specific peak at 1033 cm–1 interprets
the interaction of silver with PANI along with additional bands that
were observed to be similar to bare PANI. Structural features of the
PANI show that their surface structure is not affected after formation
of the nanocomposites.28

Ag NPs–PANI, and Ag NPs–PANI/MWCNTs.

2.3 X-ray Diffraction Analysis
X-ray
diffraction (XRD) patterns of Ag NPs–PANI and Ag NPs–PANI/MWCNT
nanocomposites are determined for structural properties of the polymer
in the composites, which are depicted in Figure 3. The XRD pattern of PANI showed a broad
hump at 2θ = 15.16, 19.50, and 25.16° which corresponds
to the (011), (020), and (200) crystal planes of emeraldine salt of
PANI, respectively, as shown in Figure S2.29 In the Ag NPs–PANI, the characteristic
peaks of silver at 38.25, 44.42, 64.55, and 77.49°, are assigned
to phase (111), (200), (220), and (311) reflections, respectively,
with (JCPDS 4-0783) and (011), (020), and (200) crystal planes of
emeraldine salt of PANI observed.30 In
the Ag NPs–PANI/MWCNTs, the peaks at 2θ = 25.2, 43.2,
and 53.7° correspond to (002), (100), and (004); all these peaks
indicate the diffraction pattern between the interplanar spacing of
MWCNTs along with the reflection plane of Ag NPs and emeraldine salt
of PANI observed.31 The XRD results exhibit
that Ag NPs–PANI and Ag NPs–PANI/MWCNTs are more crystalline
in nature than PANI because of crystalline Ag NPs in the composites.
The crystallite size of Ag NPs was calculated using the Scherrer’s
formula  where κ is the shape factor and has
a value of 0.9, λ is the wavelength (Cu Kα = 0.15405 nm),
β is the full width at half maximum of the most intense peak
(in radians), and θ is the peak position. The average crystalline
sizes of Ag NPs in the nanocomposites are observed to be at ∼15
nm.

2.4 TEM Analysis
Figure 4 shows the representative transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) micrograph of Ag NPs–PANI and Ag NPs–PANI/MWCNTs. Figure S3a represents the cylindrical tube of
F-MWCNTs with an average diameter of 20–30 nm. PANI has also
displayed a 15 nm particle size distribution as shown in Figure S3b. As shown in Figure 4a, the TEM image shows the blackish dark
spot of Ag NPs that were observed on the surface of PANI with an average
particle size of 10–14 nm. Figure 4c,d exhibits the selected area diffraction
pattern of Ag NPs–PANI and Ag NPs–PANI/MWCNTs, respectively. Figure 4b exhibits Ag NPs–PANI/MWCNTs
as a small dark spot of silver which also indicates the good distribution,
particularly on the surface, and their histogram represents particle
size distribution for Ag within the range of 15–20 nm. The
distribution of Ag nanoparticles occurs along with the π–π*
interaction between MWCNTs and aniline monomers; additionally, hydrogen
bonding within the carboxyl groups of MWCNTs and amino groups of aniline
monomers also takes place.32 However, the
inset picture of high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) indicates that distinct
lattice fringes with a d spacing of 0.42 nm corresponds
to the (111) lattice planes of the fcc of silver. Compared to Figure S3b, we can visualize from Figure 4a,b that all Ag NPs are successfully
anchored on PANI and PANI/MWCNTs. The SAED pattern depicted in Figure 4c,d has diffraction
ring (111), (200), (220), and (311) reflection planes of silver. According
to the results obtained, they exhibit the crystalline nature of nanocomposites
using HRTEM and SAED patterns, which are also in concordance with
the XRD diffraction pattern. Figure S3c,d represents the particle size histogram of Ag NPs–PANI and
Ag NPs–PANI/MWNCTs. Scanning electron microscopy micrographs
of (a) Ag NPs–PANI and (b) Ag NPs–PANI/MWNCTs are depicted
in Figure S4. It specifies that lumps of
particles with uniform aggregation of polymer composites and the clouded
matter signify the stable composite morphology.

2.5 Raman Analysis
Raman spectroscopy
is used to analyze the interaction of Ag NPs–PANI and Ag NPs–PANI/MWCNTs
shown in Figure 5.
Raman spectra of PANI, shown in Figure S5, exhibit peaks at 1360, 1494, 1598, and 1170 cm–1 which are assigned to C–N+ stretching, C=N
structure, C–C stretching of the quinonoid group, and C–H
bending of the benzenoid structure, respectively. Similar bands are
observed in Ag NPs–PANI, but the bands at 1360 and 1170 cm–1 have shifted to 1343 and 1179 cm–1, which indicates the interaction between Ag and PANI.33 Afterward, Ag NPs–PANI/MWCNT nanocomposites
are ascribed to the D band at 1325 cm–1 and to the
G band at 1578 cm–1 of MWCNTs. The shifting of D
and G bands exhibits a little defect in the MWCNTs due to being embedded
in the polymer.34 On the other hand, peaks
of carboxylated MWCNTs have been overlapped with PANI peaks and exhibit
a strong interaction between MWCNTs and PANI.

and Ag NPs–PANI/MWCNTs.

2.6 XPS Analysis
X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) spectra depicted the bond structure and its chemical
status of the samples. Survey spectra of Ag NPs–PANI/MWCNTs
consisting of C, O, N, and Ag elements are shown in Figure 6a. Nitrogen and carbon elements
were observed because of the amine group and MWCNTs present in the
sample, respectively. The Ag 3d spectrum of two peaks of Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2 at 367.9 and 373.5 eV is shown
in Figure 6b, respectively.
These peaks have a binding energy lower than that of bulk Ag such
as Ag, that is, 368.6 eV for Ag 3d5/2 and 374.3 eV for
Ag 3d5/2. The difference in binding energy between the
characterstic peaks (5.6 eV) recording the presence of elemental Ag
in the NCs. It also indicates that there is the interaction between
Ag and PANI.35 Deconvoluted peaks of N
1s are shown in Figure 6c, which have binding energies of 398.7, 399.8, 401.6, 402.8, and
403.9 eV. The peak at 398.7 eV having lowest binding energy exhibits
(=N−) the immine group, and the peak at 399.8 eV revealed
the nitrogen atom (−NH) of the amine group.36 The peaks at 401.6 and 402.8 eV are assigned to a cationic
nitrogen atom of the polymer backbone of the PANI. In addition, the
combined peak of MWCNT/PANI composites has the higher binding energy
(403.9 eV) than that of pure PANI, and it also has the signature of
the carbon and nitrogen interaction.37 Bonding
interaction can be identified by deconvoluting C 1s peaks, as shown
in Figure 6d, which
is composed of sub-peaks assigned at about 284.1 (C–C), 285.2
(C–N), and 286.1 (C–N). In addition, the peak obtained
at 286.2 eV was recognized as the π–π* “shake-up”
satellite.38

2.7 Catalytic Studies
Among the various
harmful pollutants, 4-NP is a severe pollutant; therefore, there is
an urgent need to convert such harmful pollutants into a less hazardous
compound for the purpose of a clean and safe environment and use for
chemical application. In this context, 4-NP is reduced into 4-aminophenol
(4-AP) as a product which is an effective reaction intermediate for
the preparation of analgesic and antipyretic drugs and corrosion determent.
Hence, the reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP has been taken as a model reaction
for the study of the catalytic activity of Ag NPs–PANI/MWCNT
and Ag NPs–PANI nanocomposites. The reduction of 4-NP cannot
take place in the absence of a catalyst, even though an excessive
amount of NaBH4 is used. Particularly, the absorption peak
of the 4-NP solution is depicted at 317 nm in neutral or acidic conditions,
but the aqueous solution of NaBH4 was added, and it strangely
red-shifted to 400 nm because of the formation of 4-nitrophenolate
ions.39 Actually, the reduction reaction
does not proceed in the absence of Ag NPs–PANI/MWCNT nanocomposites
because of the greater kinetic barrier between nitrophenolate anions
and BH4– ions and the unchanged absorption
peak at 400 nm after 24 h. The catalyst is playing a vital role for
the reduction of 4-NP in the presence of excess NaBH4 and
formation of the product with the new peak of 4-AP. Because of the
addition of the catalyst, the decreases in absorption peaks at 400
nm indicate that the reduction process has started, as shown in Figure 7a; subsequently,
the formation of a new characteristic peak at 300 nm made it clear
the signature of the absorption peak of 4-AP.40 As a consequence, it confirmed that the formation of 4-AP and complete
conversion take place within 240 s. The complete disappearance of
the yellow color of 4-nitrophenolate ion has resulted in the end of
the reduction reaction. In addition, Figure 7b shows complete reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP
within 300 s in the presence of Ag NPs–PANI as the catalyst.
Herein, the time period required for the reduction of Ag NPs–PANI/MWCNTs
is less than that of the Ag NPs–PANI catalyst. The excess amount
of NaBH4 in the reaction is taken into consideration for
the reduction of 4-NP as a pseudo-first-order reaction. It is a linear
relationship between ln(Ct/C0) and the reaction time for the model
reaction, in which Ct and C0 are the concentrations of 4-NP
at time t and 0, respectively. The apparent rates
of reaction (Kapp) determined from the
liner plots are calculated as K1 = 5.4
× 10–3 s–1 and K2 = 3.9 × 10–3 s–1 for Ag NPs–PANI/MWCNTs and Ag NPs–PANI, respectively.
These results exhibit that Ag NPs–PANI/MWCNTs have higher catalytic
activity than Ag NPs–PANI because of the supports of PANI,
and MWCNTs have a major role in the catalytic activity. For the further
study, the activity factors are also determined for the performance
of the catalyst. Then, activity factor κ (the ratio of Kapp to the total weight of the catalyst) is
calculated to be 5.40 and 3.9 s–1 g–1 for Ag NPs–PANI/MWCNTs and Ag NPs–PANI, respectively,
which is greater than the nanocomposites reported in the literature.22,41

PANI/MWCNTs for reduction 4-NP.

Catalyst have shown efficient activity because
of the generation
of active hydrogen atoms from sodium borohydride and these are adsorbed
to Ag NPs−PANI/MWCNTs nanocomposites. Therefore, the active
4-NP hydrogen atoms are affecting to −NO2 group
of 4-NP to produce via –NO and –NHOH based intermediates.
This Ag NPs–PANI/MWCNT can be considered as a definite prototype
model for the migration of hydrogen ions from the sodium borohydride
through a startup reduction process. The kinetics of the reaction
is monitored when the reactant is adsorbed on the surface before starting
the reaction by using the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism.42 The rate-determining step is executed because
of adsorbed species in the reaction. The adsorption/desorption equilibrium
is supposed to be much faster. Catalysts have shown better activity
because of the following two reasons: first, electron transfer from
PANI and MWCNTs, which have a conducting nature, toward the silver
nanoparticles enhances the catalytic activity.43 Second, the strong π–π stacking interactions
of 4-NP and PANI along with MWCNTs lead to adsorption of 4-NP on its
surfaces.44 Increase in the interfacial
contact due to maximum adsorption of the catalyst on the reactant
boosts catalytic activity. In summary, the effective interactions
between the PANI, MWCNTs, and Ag NPs and specific structural characteristic
of Ag NPs–PANI/MWCNT nanocomposites induce the catalytic activity
of the supported Ag NPs.

In the heterogeneous catalyst, reusability
is the key advantage
over the homogeneous catalyst. Hence, recyclability of Ag NPs–PANI/MWCNT
nanocomposites was determined by repeating the model reaction up to
five cycles as shown in Figure 7d. In each cycle, the catalyst was recovered and used as it
is for the next cycle. It showed that up to five cycles was efficient
for the reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP. In conclusion, such ternary nanocomposites
are efficient for the reduction of an organic pollutant into the intermediate
compounds for various applications.

2.8 Antibacterial Study of Ag NPs–PANI
and Ag NPs–PANI/MWCNT Nanocomposites
As is well known,
metallic silver and Ag NPs are the effective bactericidal agents.45 In the present context, the antibacterial activity
of Ag NPs, Ag NPs–PANI, and Ag NPs–PANI/MWCNT nanocomposites
was studied with Gram-positive S. aureus and Gram-negative E. coli bacteria
at various concentrations. We performed the experiment by the disc
diffusion method in which 10 and 20 μL mL–1 concentrations were taken for the Ag NPs, Ag NPs–PANI, and
Ag NPs–PANI/MWCNT nanocomposites. Indeed, the comparative study
of discs with standard drug streptomycin and penicillin was also carried
out. Then, the zone of inhibition was measured after 24 h of incubation
at 37 °C of the E. coli and S. aureus bacteria at a different concentration of
the catalyst as shown in Table 1. The Ag NPs–PANI/MWCNT nanocomposites have shown that
20 and 19 mm zones of inhibition at 20 μL mL–1 were higher than Ag NP and Ag NPs–PANI catalysts at the same
concentration for the E. coli and S. aureus bacteria, respectively, as shown in Figure 8. The well dispersion,
proper interconnectivity between the component and overall stability
of the NCs are mainly responsible for the enhanced bacterial inactivation
of the bacteria. In addition, it is also seen that the inactivation
are of E. coli bacteria using NCs is
somewhat higher to that of S.aureus bacteria because of the thinner wall of E. coli bacteria. In all cases, 20 μL mL–1 is a
higher zone of inhibition because of the higher silver concentration,
and it is more efficient on Gram-negative bacteria than Gram-positive
bacteria. Silver is used in a broad spectrum as a biocide agent, having
a plausible mechanism dependent on the different parameters such as
(i) dimension and character of NPs or (ii) physicochemical interaction
between the donor atoms as N, S, and O of bacteria with its cation.
Subsequently, bacterial respiration and adenosine triphosphate syntheses
are disturbing because of the silver ions attached to the DNA of bacteria.46 However, the zone of inhibition of reference
drugs streptomycin and penicillin 20 and 22 mm was observed that is
comparable with our Ag NPs–PANI/MWCNT nanocomposites. These
results which were comparable with Co–PANI/MWCNT nanocomposites
are reported in the literature.47 The well
dispersion of NCs results into higher surface area of Ag NPs and acidic
functional group of PANI led to bacterial inactivation.48 It also showed higher antibacterial enforcement
to the Gram-negative cell wall, having reduced the osmotic pressure
that maintains the physical interaction between them.49,50 In addition, the various chemical factors of PANI such as surface
hydrophilicity, polymer chain length, and molecular weight are responsible
for the enhanced permeability of the bacterial cell membrane and development
of stress-resistant bio-films.51 MWCNTs
also exhibit antibacterial activity because their 1D nanomaterials
form composites with zero-dimensional silver nanoparticles, which
enhances the physical property of silver nanoparticles for antibacterial
application.16 Nevertheless, the charged
functionalities have enhanced interactions with the surface of bacteria.
It leads to penetration into the cell with higher permeability with
the membrane, decrease in metabolic function, and finally cell death.52 As a result, we show that ternary hybrid Ag
NPs–PANI/MWCNTs have not only an active catalyst against the
4-NP pollutant but also effective biocides against both types of bacteria.

3 Conclusions
Metal-supported PANI/MWCNT
was synthesized using the in situ polymerization
of aniline for effective catalysis and antibacterial application.
The spectroscopic and instrumental techniques have revealed its chemical
and structural properties. The apparent rate of reaction (Kapp) for reduction 4-NP to 4-AP is K1 = 5.4 × 10–3 s–1 and K2 = 3.9 × 10–3 s–1 for Ag NPs–PANI/MWCNTs and Ag NPs–PANI,
respectively. The rate constant reveals that the Ag NPs–PANI/MWCNTs
have enhanced the rate of reaction as compared to Ag NPs–PANI
nanocomposites. The conducting support material and higher adsorption
of the reactant on the catalyst led to significant catalytic activities.
The antibacterial study reveals that ternary nanocomposites are in
the higher zone of inhibition as compared to binary nanocomposites.
The synergistic effect of nanocomposites makes them a more effective
antibacterial agent against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.
Therefore, such a type of hybrid ternary nanocomposites has been explored
for use in the field of catalysis as well as biomedical sectors.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
The monomer, aniline, was
purchased from Thomas Baker India, and ammonium persulphate [(NH4)2S2O8], sodium dodecyl sulfate,
and silver nitrate (AgNO3) were purchased from Qualigenes,
India. MWCNTs were obtained from Nanotechnology India. These MWCNTs
had a length of 20 μm, a diameter of 10–20 nm, and aspect
ratios of 1000. Double distilled water was used during the synthesis.

4.2 Synthesis of Ag NPs–PANI Nanocomposites
The synthesis of the Ag–PANI nanocomposite was carried out
using the in situ polymerization method. In a round-bottom flask,
10 mL of 0.01 M silver nitrate solution was stirred for 30 min, and
dextrose (10 mL, 10 mM) was added with stirring in the flat bottom
flask. Then, 0.1 M of 20 mL of sodium dodecyl sulphate solution was
added with constant stirring. Then, precooled 0.5 mL of aniline solution,
1.26 g mL–1 of p-TSA, and 0.01
M of ammonium persulphate were added dropwise and constantly stirred
for 12 h. The Ag–PANI nanocomposite was filtered and washed
with alcohol and dried in the oven for 2 h. The Ag NPs–PANI
nanocomposite was filtered and washed with alcohol and dried in the
oven for 2 h.

4.3 Synthesis of Ag NPs–PANI/MWCNT Nanocomposites
Ternary nanocomposites of Ag NPs–PANI/MWCNTs have been synthesized
with a typical, in situ chemical method. F-MWCNTs (60 mg) were added
in aqueous solution and sonicated for 45 min at room temperature.
In another round-bottom flask, silver nitrate was stirred for 20 min
at room temperature, and the sodium dodecyl sulphate solution was
added. Then, the dextrose solution was added with constant stirring.
Afterward, 0.5 mL of the aniline monomer and p-TSA
was added, followed by addition of ammonium persulphate dropwise for
the polymerization of aniline. The aspect ratio (1:1) of the monomer
and the oxidizing agent was maintained during the reaction. Then,
dispersed solution of MWCNTs was added and stirred for 15 min. The
whole reaction mixture was stirred for 12 h for complete polymerization
of aniline. Consequently, the final product was dried at 70 °C
to acquire nanocomposites. Scheme 1 represents the synthetic protocol of Ag NPs–PANI/MWCNT
nanocomposites.

4.4 Catalytic Reduction of 4-NP
The catalytic
activity of Ag NPs–PANI/MWCNTs and Ag NPs–PANI was studied
for the reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP using NaBH4 as a reducing
agent at room temperature. In this case, aqueous solution of 4-NP
[(1 × 10–4 M), 0.2 mL] was taken in the cuvette,
and [0.1 M, 2 mL] NaBH4 was added in the cuvette. Afterward,
Ag NPs–PANI/MWCNTs and Ag NPs–PANI nanocomposites (1
mg) were added. Subsequently, the change in the concentration of 4-NP
was monitored using a UV–visible spectrometer.

4.5 Antibacterial Study
The antibacterial
study of Ag NPs, Ag NPs–PANI, and Ag NPs–PANI/MWCNTs
was carried out by the disc diffusion method and broth macrodilution
method. The human pathogenic bacteria strain of S.
aureus and E. coli was
used for the study. The disc diffusion method was used for the determination
of antibacterial efficacy; the bacteria were grown 24 h in the liquid
nutrient broth. Then, a laminar air flow-sterilized Mueller Hinton
agar medium was transferred into autoclaved Petri dishes. After the
medium solidified, the culture of each bacterium was uniformly spread
on the surface using a glass spreader. In each Petri dish, sterile
paper discs impregnated with 10–20 μL each of Ag NPs,
Ag NPs–PANI, and Ag NPs–PANI/MWCNT nanocomposites were
inoculated and then incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Then, the zone
of inhibition was measured in millimeter (mm). The comparative studies
have been carried with Ag NPs–PANI/MWCNT nanocomposites in
the presence of standard drugs such as streptomycin and penicillin.
All the experiments were performed in triplicates.

4.6 Characterizations
UV–visible
spectra of nanocomposites were analyzed with a UV–VIS 3092
spectrophotometer having a wavelength range of 200–800 nm,
which was obtained from Lab India. FTIR spectra of samples were used
to determine the functional group as well as chemical constitutes
of the composites recorded in the range of 500–4000 cm–1 using the FTIR Thermo Fisher India instrument. XRD
analysis of Ag NPs–PANI/MWCNTs was carried out by a PerkinElmer
PHI-5400 diffractometer, employing Cu Kα radiation of wavelength
1.5406 Å. The data were taken in the range of 10–90°
(2θ), with a step size of 0.02°. The TEM (JEM-2100) model
was used for the morphology and particle size analysis. Raman spectra
of the sample were observed by using a FT-Raman spectrophotometer
(Bruker MultiRAM, Germany make) in the spectral range of 1000–1800
cm–1. Chemical status and its bonding were determined
by XPS, VG Multilab 2000, Thermo VG Scientific, UK with a monochromatic
Mg Kα (1253.6 eV) radiation source.
