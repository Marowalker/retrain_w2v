We
studied the synthesis of nanocomposite materials consisting
of noble metal clusters embedded in an oxide semiconductor matrix.
The embedded nanostructures form in a simple self-organized single-step
growth process. The primary interest is in developing materials for
photo-electrochemical energy conversion where spatially inhomogeneous
band structures can enhance photogenerated charge separation and carrier
extraction from a semiconductor. We show that spontaneous segregation
of metallic Ir occurs during the initial growth of an Ir:SrTiO3 thin film. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy
suggests that the nanoscale Ir clusters are epitaxial with the host
lattice, and their presence is not detectable by surface morphology
measurements.

1 Introduction
Composite materials consisting
of an oxide matrix combined with
metal nanostructures are widely studied in the area of catalysis for
pollution control1 and energy conversion.2 The most common composite designs consist of
nanoscale metal particles deposited on a ceramic oxide support, which
typically has a passive role and only serves to provide a thermally
and mechanically stable substrate with a large surface area for the
catalytically active metal nanoparticles.3 A different class of nanocomposites involves metal nanoparticles
either at the surface of or embedded in an oxide support where the
interplay between the oxide support and the metal leads to the desired
catalytic functionality. Plasmonic energy-harvesting photocatalysts
are an example of this class of materials.4 Another well-known example is the use of noble metal cocatalysts
on the surface of photocatalytic semiconductor oxides for efficient
extraction of photogenerated holes or electrons.5

Bulk nanoscale metal–oxide composites, where
metal nanoparticles
are embedded in an oxide matrix, are less common, but a photo-electrochemical
water splitting electrode based on self-organized Ir metal pillars
in a SrTiO3 matrix has recently been reported.6 Spontaneous Ir metal segregation was suggested
to occur at the initial substrate interface during Ir-doped SrTiO3 growth, which eventually leads to the formation of macroscopic
metal pillars along the film growth direction. A slightly similar
idea has been used to design an intelligent Pd catalyst for automotive
emission control.7

From the point
of view of photocatalytic energy conversion, bulk
metal–oxide composites have a number of advantages. Because
the embedded nanostructures form in a self-organized process, the
composite material can be grown in a relatively simple and cheap single-step
synthesis process without the need for nanoscale patterning.8 Compared to various three-dimensional nanostructures
grown on the surface of a catalyst,9 nanostructures
embedded in the crystal lattice of an oxide matrix are mechanically
robust, which may extend the working life of a practical photocatalyst.
Composites containing nanoscale noble metal inclusions close to the
surface of a semiconductor matrix are of particular interest because,
because of the large work function of noble metals, it is possible
to induce local changes in the surface band bending of the semiconductor,
similar to cocatalysts precipitated on surfaces.10 In an electronic sense, a thin nanocomposite layer is thus
equivalent to a semiconductor photoelectrode coated with noble metal
cocatalyst nanoparticles but offers a more stable mechanical structure
with better control over the spatial variation of the electronic structure
in the vicinity of the noble metal inclusions.

In general, the
three-dimensional morphology of nanoscale inclusions
can be controlled during thin film deposition by lattice strain, growth
rate, growth temperature, and the oxygen pressure. The oxygen pressure
is a particularly important process parameter for noble metal dopants
such as Ir. At relatively high pressures, in the range of 10–1 Torr, Ir can be oxidized to IrO3, which is volatile,
and Ir is thus lost during film growth to evaporation.11 At intermediate oxygen pressures of 10–3 to 10–2 Torr, earlier work has shown the occurrence
of macroscopic metal segregation for several noble metals.6 The same work suggested, on the basis of atomic
force microscopy (AFM) observations, that films grown at low pressures
of around 10–6 Torr appear to be homogeneous. It
is thus interesting to look at the Ir dopant behavior in this lower
oxygen pressure regime to determine if Ir dopants are indeed homogeneously
distributed in the host lattice or some form of nanoscale clustering
still occurs.

In this work, we therefore study the surface morphology,
growth
mode, and Ir dopant distribution in films grown at an oxygen pressure
of 10–6 Torr. The Ir doping was set at a level of
5%, which is a typical doping level for dopants in SrTiO3-based photocatalyst studies.12 We show
that despite having apparently smooth step-and-terrace surfaces, the
Ir:SrTiO3 films grown under these conditions exhibit nanoscale
Ir segregation.

2 Experimental and Calculation
Details
Ir-doped SrTiO3 thin films were grown
on TiO2-terminated SrTiO3(001) substrates by
pulsed laser deposition
(PLD). The film thickness was typically 10 unit cells (∼4 nm).
The substrates were annealed at 900 °C for 10 min at an oxygen
pressure of 5 × 10–6 Torr to obtain an atomically
flat step-and-terrace surface prior to film growth. The films were
grown at 700 °C and 5 × 10–6 Torr of oxygen
using a polycrystalline SrTi0.95Ir0.05O3 target. The polycrystalline target was ablated with a KrF
excimer laser (λ = 248 nm) at a laser fluence of ∼0.64
J/cm2 and a repetition rate of 1 Hz. The growth rate (∼145
pulses/nm) was monitored in real time by reflection high-energy electron
diffraction (RHEED). The film surface morphology was characterized
by ex situ AFM. Observation of the atomic-scale crystal structure
along the (100) direction was performed on cross-sectional samples
using high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron
microscopy (HAADF–STEM) with a spatial resolution of ∼0.08
nm. The HAADF collection angle extended from 68 to 280 mrad, efficiently
minimizing diffraction effects. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometry
was used to analyze the local chemical composition in the cross-sectional
specimens. The STEM specimens were prepared by focused ion beam (FIB)
microsampling, followed by thinning with 30 keV Ga ions. Finally,
low-energy (5 keV) broad-beam milling was used to reduce FIB damage.
The final thickness of the specimen was about 40 nm. The top surface
of the film was protected by a conducting polycrystalline Pt layer,
which can be observed in the displayed images. The Ir valence was
determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using an Al Kα
X-ray source (1486.6 eV).

First-principles calculations based
on the density functional theory
(DFT) were performed using the projector augmented-wave method13 as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation
package14,15 and with a cutoff energy of 500 eV. The
first Brillouin zone was sampled by a 6 × 6 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack
grid.16 The exchange–correlation
energy was approximated by the generalized-gradient approximation
(GGA-PBE) method.17 The atomic structure
was optimized for a symmetric slab built with 3 × 3 × 6.5
SrTiO3 unit cells (u.c.) and delimited by TiO2-terminated surfaces separated by a vacuum thickness of at least
1.5 nm. The lateral lattice parameters were fixed to the calculated
value for SrTiO3 (a = 0.3947 nm). Each
structural model contains two Ir atoms substituting Ti atoms, as octahedral
atomic sites were found to be the most favorable for such substitution.18

3 Results and Discussion
Oscillations of the RHEED specular spot intensity observed during
the deposition of an Ir:SrTiO3 film are shown in Figure 1a. Clear oscillations
can be observed for at last 10 u.c., which indicates that the growth
proceeded in a layer-by-layer mode.19 However,
the intensity of the oscillations clearly decreases. Because the film
surface retains a step-and-terrace morphology, as shown by the AFM
image in Figure 1b,
we can conclude that the oscillation intensity drop is not associated
with a spread of the crystal growth front over several unit cell layers
but is instead related to the local surface roughness increase during
the growth of an Ir-doped SrTiO3 film.

Figure 1 RHEED oscillation and
sample surface morphology. (a) RHEED specular
spot intensity oscillation observed during film deposition. A change
in the surface termination occurs after the growth of five u.c., marked
by an arrow. (b) AFM surface morphology of a 4 u.c. thick Ir(5%):SrTiO3 film grown on a SrTiO3(001) substrate. The heights
of all step edges are ∼0.4 nm.

An abrupt change in the intensity oscillations occurs after
300
s, at a film thickness of 6 u.c. This type of specular intensity phase
shift has been associated with a change of the surface termination
of the film.20 Because the chemically etched
substrate surface is initially terminated by the TiO2 layer,
we can assume that during the growth of the first five u.c., the film
retains the perovskite B-site TiO2 termination. Figure 1b shows the morphology
of the film surface after the growth of four u.c. Clearly, the step-and-terrace
surface morphology of the SrTiO3 substrate was replicated
on the film surface. Because the growth of nondoped SrTiO3 proceeds under identical growth conditions in a layer-by-layer mode
for hundreds of u.c.,21 the surface change
observed in Ir-doped films thicker than 5 u.c. is most likely related
to segregation of the Ir dopants.

Figure 2a shows
a cross-sectional HAADF–STEM image of a 10 u.c. thick Ir:SrTiO3 film taken along the [010] zone axis. The perfect match between
the film and the substrate lattice, better observed in Figure 2b, shows that the film is fully
epitaxial and coherent with the SrTiO3 substrate. The images
show several bright spots, about 1 nm in size, in the Ir-doped film.
These bright spots are all located at the same depth from the surface
within the first five u.c. of the film. Figure 2c presents an intensity profile of the atomically
resolved HAADF image displayed in Figure 2b, integrated over a direction parallel to
the interface. It shows that the presence of the bright spots causes
a contrast blurring that does not affect the atomic plane spacing
but increases the background intensity. Such bright spots are commonly
observed in HAADF–STEM images when transverse atomic displacements
occur, originating from strain fields associated with dislocation
cores or point defects.22 In our case,
the observed contrast is most probably caused by local enrichment
with Ir atoms, favoring local structural distortions and, Ir being
heavier than Ti, enhancing the Z-contrast (atomic
number contrast) in the HAADF–STEM image.

image of a 5% Ir-doped SrTiO3 (10 u.c.) film on a SrTiO3 (001) substrate. (a)
Wide view and (b) magnified view of the film observed along the [010]
zone axis. (c) HAADF intensity profile in the marked square region
integrated along the horizontal direction (parallel to the substrate
interface).

The variation of the
Ir concentration in different parts of the
film was analyzed by acquiring EDX spectra in the square regions defined
in the HAADF–STEM images shown in Figure 3. To distinguish the Ir Lα peak at
9.174 keV, the figure presents magnified regions of the EDX spectra
in an energy range close to the Cu K peaks, which originate from the
copper grid on which the sample was mounted. Comparison of the spectra
shows that the Ir Lα peak has a much higher intensity in the
bright spots (Figure 3a) than in the darker regions in which almost no Ir was detected
(Figure 3b). A slight
Ir enrichment is also observed in the vicinity of the film surface
(Figure 3c,d). The
evolution of the Ir peak intensity from the substrate toward the film
surface is clearly observed in the line profile of the Ir Lα
peak amplitude recorded across a bright spot and displayed in Figure 3d.

Figure 3 EDX spectra recorded
at three different regions of the same 5%
Ir-doped SrTiO3 film giving evidence for a strong variation
in the Ir content. (a) Ir Lα peak measured at a bright spot,
(b) Ir Lα peak measured in between bright spots, (c) Ir Lα
peak measured close to the surface, and (d) line profile across a
bright spot.

The bright spots are
thus clearly associated with local Ir enrichment
in regions that are 2–4 u.c. wide (about 0.8–1.5 nm).
The bright spots appear to be well-separated, the projected distance
between them being 2–8 nm for a ∼40 nm thick cross-sectional
specimen.

The relative stability of Ir cations as a function
of substitution
of Ti octahedral site location in the film was investigated by DFT
calculations. Three configurations with different Ir distributions
were considered: with one Ir atom in each TiO2 surface
layer (Figure 4 S),
with one Ir atom in each TiO2 subsurface layer (Figure 4 S-1), and with two
Ir atoms in the same TiO2 central atomic layer (Figure 4 C). The results
show that for sufficiently low Ir doping levels, the positioning of
the two Ir atoms at the surface (S) is energetically less stable by
0.59 eV than having the Ir atoms located in the subsurface layer (S-1)
or in the center (C) of the slab. These two last configurations (S-1
and C) have the same stability as they give almost equal total energies
with a difference of only 0.01 eV, confirming that, away from the
surface, Ir atoms do not have any preferential location (far or near
each other), as far as they are located in an octahedral atomic site.
This result agrees with our previous calculations performed on Ir-doped
bulk SrTiO3.18

Figure 4 Atomic structures used
for calculations, two Ir atoms in 3 ×
3 × 6.5 SrTiO3 supercell (∼3.2% Ir): with one
Ir atom in each TiO2 surface layer (S), with one Ir atom
in each TiO2 subsurface layer (S-1), and with the two atoms
in the same center TiO2 atomic layer (C). The relative
energetic stability of the different configurations is shown for each
configuration. The total energy of the most stable structure (C) is
taken as a reference.

The nature of the iridium atoms within the film and close
to the
surface was investigated using XPS. XPS spectra of the Ir 4f5/2 and 4f7/2 core level peaks are shown in Figure 5. Deconvolution of the peak
profile showed that the Ir:SrTiO3 film contained Ir4+ and Ir0 components. The inelastic mean free path
of photoelectrons in an XPS measurement using the Al Kα source
is only a few nanometers, which means that the depth distribution
of the Ir4+ and Ir0 components can be estimated
by measuring spectra at different takeoff angles. Measurements closer
to the surface normal direction can detect photoelectron emission
from deeper layers than measurements done at lower takeoff angles,
which are more surface-sensitive. Figure 5a,b shows Ir 4f peak profiles measured at
45° and 20° takeoff angles (as measured from the sample
surface), respectively. The Ir0 ratio (∼13%) was
higher in the more surface-sensitive spectrum taken at a takeoff angle
of 20°. In comparison, the Ir0 ratio was ∼10%
for the 45° spectrum. Whereas tetravalent Ir4+ is
expected for iridium atoms substituted for Ti, as considered in the
DFT calculations, metallic Ir0 is observed. The Ir0 content difference between the two takeoff angles is small,
and considering the effective probing depth, metallic Ir0 is likely to be present in the clusters observed by HAADF–STEM.

Figure 5 Ir 4f5/2 and 4f7/2 XPS spectra of a 5% Ir-doped
SrTiO3 film taken with an Al Kα X-ray source (1486.6
eV). The takeoff angle from the sample surface was 45° in (a)
and 20° in (b). The spectrum in (b) is more surface-sensitive.

This result suggests that clustering
and the appearance of metallic
Ir0 already occurs for 5% doping and shows that the Ir
dopant atoms are not homogeneously distributed among the Ti sites
of the host SrTiO3 lattice.

Ir is known to form macroscopic
self-organized metallic nanopillars
in SrTiO3 when films are grown by PLD at intermediate oxygen
pressures of around 1 mTorr.6 In the present
study, the films were grown at 5 × 10–6 Torr,
a pressure which was assumed to yield homogeneously doped Ir:SrTiO3 films, where uniformly distributed Ir atoms occupy Ti sites
of the SrTiO3 lattice. However, whereas AFM images of the
films showed no surface structures suggesting Ir segregation, atomically
resolved HAADF–STEM images and associated EDX analyses gave
evidence for the occurrence of segregation of the Ir atoms forming
Ir-rich cluster in the films. A possible scenario can be derived from
the obtained experimental results. The XPS spectra show that metallic
Ir0 is present in the film, which means that Ir must occupy
other lattice sites besides just replacing Ti. Because the films are
grown at a low oxygen pressure of 5 × 10–6 Torr
and oxygen vacancies thus exist in the lattice during growth, the
most likely cluster formation scenario is the placement of Ir atoms
at the oxygen site, forming a metallic defect in the crystal. It is
known that under suitable thermodynamic and kinetic growth conditions,
nanometer-scale fcc-type metallic Ir inclusions can form in Ir:SrTiO3. Most likely, the clusters observed in the HAADF–STEM
images in this work are the initial seeds of such macroscopic metal
inclusions.

The Ir-rich cluster size appears to be quite uniform,
and the distribution
of clusters in the growth direction is clearly not random. There are
a large number of clusters in the HAADF–STEM image within the
first five u.c., but no clusters can be found in the next three u.c.
of the film. Considering the phase shift observed in the RHEED intensity
oscillations, it appears that the cluster formation and growth are
related to the surface composition of the film and the lateral diffusion
rate of Ir on the surface.

4 Conclusions
We have
shown that Ir-rich clusters form in Ir-doped SrTiO3 films
during the initial growth phase. Although the formation
of macroscopic Ir metallic inclusions in SrTiO3 has been
observed before,6 the STEM–EDX analysis
in this work shows that Ir clustering occurs on a unit cell scale
even when films are grown at low oxygen pressures. Because the cluster
size of 2–8 nm is below the AFM spatial resolution limit, such
segregation is difficult to detect by surface morphology analysis.
Even if no obvious surface segregation is seen by AFM, Ir clustering
may still occur. We showed that the small clusters cannot be seen
in surface topography but can be detected by STEM. This pointed out
to the importance of combining topography analyses with XPS or STEM
exploration to verify whether metal clustering occurs when synthesizing
noble metal-doped perovskites for photo-electrochemical applications.
The extent of the nanoclusters in the growth direction depends on
a combination of thermodynamic (temperature and oxygen pressure) and
kinetic (growth rate) factors. We find that the 5% doping level exceeds
the solubility limit of homogeneous Ir:SrTiO3 in SrTiO3, as shown by the XPS measurement, excess Ir segregation starting
immediately at the initial growth stage. The mechanism studied here
is expected to be an effective method for synthesizing photoelectrode
materials based on noble metal nanoclusters supported in an oxide
matrix. The application area of such materials is photo-electrochemical
energy conversion.
