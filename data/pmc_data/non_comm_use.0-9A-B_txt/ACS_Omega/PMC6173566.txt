This
research was conducted to create a plant-available nitrogen nutrient
solution utilizing ruminant bacteria for ultimate use as a liquid
nitrogen fertilizer for precision fertigation of vegetable crops. Three hyperammonia-producing ruminant bacteria, Clostridium aminophilum, Peptostreptococcus
anaerobius, and Clostridium sticklandii, were cultured anaerobically using five different organic nitrogen
substrates to determine their efficiency in producing bioammonium/ammonia
(BAA), a term defined here as a biologically produced solution containing
both ammonium and ammonia. These bacteria were chosen because of their
ability to produce ammonium at rates not experienced by any other
bacteria. The five substrates were soy protein isolate (SPI), blood
meal, feather meal, dried fish, and yeast extract (Y) used alone and
in combination with Y. C. aminophilum and SPI were selected for further experimentation in an attempt
to maximize BAA production. These substrates were chosen because they
are commonly fed to cattle and they are also used as organic fertilizer
amendments. C. aminophilum was cultured
with SPI rates from 0.8 g·10 mL–1 salt solution
reaching SPI’s maximum solubility level at 1.6 g·10 mL–1 salt solution at 0.2 g intervals, and the BAA content
was measured every 24 h for 168 h. It was concluded that there was
no significant benefit in culturing C. aminophilum with more than 1.0 g·10 mL–1 for more than
96 h to achieve maximum BAA concentrations.

Introduction
Public awareness and
demand for healthier foods have led to an increased consumption of
organic vegetables, resulting in one of the fastest growing agricultural
markets in the United States.1 The increased
demand for organic produce necessitates exploration and optimization
of organic sources of fertilizer. Plants can only absorb nutrients
in mineralized forms such as ammonium or nitrate.2 Organic sources of nitrogen (N) are found in proteins,
polypeptides, and amino acids; prior to uptake by a plant, microorganisms
must convert these sources into mineral forms.3 Many different species of microorganisms accomplish this conversion
in a variety of terrestrial, aquatic, and symbiotic environments.
In typical agricultural settings, these microbial-mediated transformations
occur in the soil rhizosphere of the plant. These transformations
are highly variable and dependent on a healthy soil food web and favorable
climatic and environmental conditions.4 These conditions are especially lacking in sandy soils common on
South Carolina’s coastal plain region (personal communication
with Powell Smith, Extension Agent, Clemson University). Infertile
soils in this region also impede the success of conventional growers
transitioning to organic production. Organic crops growing on these
infertile soils may demand more available N than the soils can provide.5 It is challenging to conduct comparative studies
with organic and conventional vegetables because of the mineralization
state of the fertilizers. Essentially, bound N found in organic fertilizer
amendments cannot benefit plant growth until mineralized and made
plant available. Lack of available N during critical growth stages6 can result in nutrient deficiencies, delayed
maturity, lack of uniform maturity, lower yields, and quality changes.

The first step in the mineralization of organic matter and N-rich
proteins in the rhizosphere is the production of ammonia. In an effort
to quantify mineralization rates of organic fertilizers in soils,
Hartz and Johnstone6 compared the mineralization
rate of feather meal (FM), dried fish (DF), and blood meal (BM) mixed
with field soil incubated for 8 weeks at 10, 15, 20, and 25 °C,
respectively. Nitrogen mineralization rates were not significantly
different at differing temperatures and occurred rapidly for the first
2 weeks. Across all temperatures, 8 week N mineralization averaged
60, 62, and 66% for FM, DF, and BM, respectively. Although slow mineralization
rates can be an advantage in certain scenarios such as for use in
slow-release fertilizers, the mineralization rates of these soil amendments
in the above-mentioned study are still far too slow to effectively
fertilize vegetable crops through drip fertigation.6 Therefore, microorganisms existing naturally in the soil
in Hartz and Johnstone’s experiment failed to mineralize these
organic fertilizers fast enough for optimal crop growth. Microorganisms
capable of accomplishing more efficient rates of mineralization in
bioreactor situations for controlled mineralization of these organic
N substrates need further investigation.

The largest source
of ammonia production in natural environments is not terrestrial or
aquatic but is in ruminant digestion as the loss of protein-based
urea N through the symbiotic metabolism of both rumen microorganisms
and metabolism of feed by rumen microorganisms.7 The efficiency of dietary N is approximately 15% of the
total N consumed in the diet of ruminants, and the remaining 85% can
be lost through excretion in which8 scientists
have estimated that as much as 50% of N in ruminant feed is lost as
ammonia. In ruminant nutrition, amino acid deamination is nutritionally
wasteful. Early attempts by Russell et al.9 to isolate bacteria responsible for excess ammonia production in
the rumen concluded that Peptostreptococcus and Clostridium species were the
organisms responsible when soybean meal was an ingredient in ruminant
feed. This early work eventually gave rise to the isolation and characterization
of a novel new group of obligate amino acid-fermenting bacteria designated
as hyperammonia-producing (HAP), and of particular interest was the
discovery of three new HAP species: Peptostreptococcus
anaerobius, Clostridium sticklandii, and Clostridium aminophilum.10 In a continuous culture, these bacteria had
developed an affinity for yeast extract (Y) at 0.5 g·L–1 (J. B. Russell, personal communication). Recent interest in the
HAP bacterial species has developed strategies to inhibit their growth
because the cost of feed supplements to cattle producers is expensive
and the loss of nitrogen from these organisms is very wasteful.

BM, FM, DF, Y, and soy protein isolate (SPI) are used not only as
feed supplements but also as organic fertilizer amendments because
they are protein-based and rich in nitrogen. All of them are rich
in N and contain specific amino acids that are conducive to rapid
growth of the HAP species; they also produce large amounts of ammonia
byproducts that may be used in organic crop production (Table 1.). The goal in this experiment
was to orchestrate the conversion of a protein source by an HAP species
in some novel bioreactor, which is similar to a ruminant digestion,
with various organic N substrates to capture and produce BAA at a
known concentration and use this product to precision-fertilize vegetables
organically.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the ammonia-producing
ability of P. anaerobius, C. sticklandii, and C. aminophilum grown in vitro in pure culture on BM, FM, DF, Y, and SPI to subsequently
identify one bacteria species and protein substrate that produces
maximum ammonia concentrations for its ultimate use as an ammonia/nitrate
fertilizer in organic crop production. A subsequent study will then
focus on the bacteria’s ability to produce maximum BAA using
minimal protein substrate amounts over various time frequencies.

Results
and Discussion
Bacteria Selection Assay
The relative
importance of each source of variation and interaction in the analysis
of variance (ANOVA) were partitioned (Table 2). Of all sources, bacteria species accounted
for the greatest amount of variation (47.1%.; P <
0.0001). Replication accounted for only 2.9% of the variation, indicating
that repetitions of this experiment were very similar and predictable
to each other. The substrate was also highly significant at the P ≤ 0.0001 level, accounting for only 4.2% of the
variation. The interaction of HAP species with the substrate was highly
significant and accounted for 17.0% of the variation, which indicated
that not all bacteria responded similarly to the substrate. The main
effect of time on BAA evolution was also highly significant and accounted
for 9.7% of the variation. The interaction of HAP species with time
was highly significant, accounting for 4.0% of the variation. Because
of lack of replication and small sample size, an uncontrolled error
accounted for 11.3% of the variation. The coefficient of variation
(CV) for this experiment was considered low at 31.1%.

Of greatest importance in this experiment
was the interaction between HAP bacteria and substrates on BAA production
(Figure 1). All three
HAP species grew with nine organic N substrate combinations and produced
BAA; however, there was a clear superiority among the HAP species. P. anaerobius was the least efficient bacteria, producing
significantly equal amounts of BAA with all the nine organic N substrate
combinations. C. sticklandii tended
to produce intermediate BAA concentrations compared to P. anaerobius and C. aminophilum in all experimental combinations, producing significantly the same
BAA concentrations on SPI + Y, BM, BM + Y, FM + Y, DF, DF + Y, and
Y alone and the lowest BAA concentrations on the SPI and FM. Consistent
with the literature, C. aminophilum produced the highest BAA concentrations compared to P. anaerobius and C. sticklandii.10C. aminophilum produced significantly the highest BAA concentration when cultured
on SPI alone (7.23 mM) and significantly higher than any other HAP
species or organic N substrate combination. C. aminophilum produced significantly less BAA when Y was added to SPI and BM,
indicating the suppressive effect of Y with these two organic N substrates;
however, when Y was added to FM and DF, the decrease was not statistically
significant. C. aminophilum, when cultured
with Y alone, produced the lowest BAA concentrations. When pooled
over organic N substrates, C. aminophilum produced higher BAA concentrations at 96 h than the other two HAP
species; C. sticklandii produced equal
BAA concentrations at 96 h when compared to C. aminophilum at 24 h (Figure 2). P. anaerobius significantly produced
the lowest BAA concentrations and was unaffected by time and very
low growth rates as indicated by the low production of BAA.

The initial goal was
to determine one HAP species and one organic N substrate combination
capable of producing the highest BAA concentrations in a minimum duration
of time, which was achieved with C. aminophilum when cultured on SPI. Further, temporal analysis was performed at
96 h. The interaction between C. aminophilum, substrate, and time was highly significant at P ≤ 0.0001 (Table 3). The total error accounted for only 7.8% of the total variation
with a small CV (14.4%). Finally, there was a clear indication that C. aminophilum produced more BAA when cultured with
SPI at 96 h (Figure 3) than any other organic N substrate combinations.

C. aminophilum SPI Rate Study
C. aminophilum was cultured with five SPI concentrations with a zero control for
168 h to determine the maximum BAA concentration produced in the shortest
time period using the lowest SPI concentration. A rate of 0.8 g was
chosen as the baseline rate because preliminary experiments indicated
that this is where BAA concentrations first experienced curvilinear
responses (data not shown); SPI rates were increased at 0.2 g intervals
to the maximum SPI solubility at 1.6 g·10 mL–1, and the sampling interval time was extended to 168 h.

When
analyzing all sources of variation, the time factor accounted for
the greatest amount of variation with the SPI rate accounting for
a far less variation (Table 4). The uncontrolled error accounted for a significant portion
of the total variation and may be attributed to the low viscosity
of the higher SPI rates with salt solution and the lack of agitation
between samplings.

Incremental polynomial regression models for each rate were then
selected based on the model that best explained the data (Figure 4). SPI rates of 0.8
and 1.0 g exhibited a curvilinear third-order model response with R2 values of 0.65 and 0.69, respectively. A rate
of 1.0 g plateaued, displaying nearly flat-line BAA levels after 96
h and slightly more BAA than 0.8 g for each sampling interval. When
the SPI rate was increased to 1.2 g·10 mL–1 salt solution, a third-order model was chosen to describe the data,
exhibiting unstable BAA levels in the later sampling intervals with
nearly identical BAA levels to the 1.0 g SPI rate at 96 and 144 h,
respectively. SPI rates of 1.4 and 1.6 g displayed second- and fourth-order
models, respectively, with BAA production decreasing after 96 h, indicating
variability and instability.

Figure 4 Polynomial regression models of the interaction
of C. aminophilum, SPI, rate and time
with BAA production.

Stability and consistent plateauing of BAA production were
achieved with an SPI rate of 1.0 g·10 mL–1 salt
solution at the sampling interval of 96 h . The other SPI rates and
sampling intervals were unstable and were not predictable enough with
higher SPI rates.

Conclusions
The initial goal for
conducting this research was to create a biologically derived source
of ammonium nitrate for precision fertilization of specialty vegetable
crops. This was achieved by scrutinizing various HAP bacteria and
substrates for their ability to produce BAA. Essentially, a novel group of HAP bacteria was discovered from the cattle rendering industry,
which negatively affect ruminant metabolism but can positively be
used in generating organic N fertilizers. Specifically, C. aminophilum and SPI yielded the greatest BAA.
Furthermore, taking into account solubility, bioreaction stability,
and reliability, it was determined that the 1.2 g SPI rate was practically
identical to the 1.0 g rate at the sampling interval of 96 h , and
the additional cost would not warrant the use of this rate in upscaled
production scenarios. Future research will focus on field studies
evaluating the efficacy of this bacteria substrate-derived N source.

Experimental
Section
Generating Anaerobic Conditions
Specific anaerobic
conditions were developed according to the work pioneered by Hungate11 and published in the Anaerobe Laboratory Manual
4th ed. 1977, Anaerobe Laboratory, Virginia Polytechnic Institute
and State University, Blacksburg, VA. Anaerobic gas utilized throughout
the process consisted of 10% CO2, 10% H2, and
80% N2 (Airgas National Welders Supply Company, Charleston,
SC). To scrub out all oxygen contamination of the gases, the above-mentioned
gas was passed through a copper shaving-filled borosilicate glass
tube of 1.5 m (length), 48 mm (o.d.), and a thickness of 4 mm (Texas
A&M, Department of Chemistry and Engineering, College Station,
Texas). This tube was wrapped with a HTS/Amptek (2.5 cm wide ×
1.8 m long) fiberglass-shielded heating tape (model AWO-0120-080 HTS;
Amptek Company, Stafford, Texas) and heated to 300 °C, which
was controlled by a Thermolyne, type 45500, input controller (model
CN45515; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA). This gas was
passed from the bottom of the anaerobic tube, directed to the top
of the tube at 20 kPa, and controlled by a Purox oxygen regulator
(model R-72-75-540 21524; ESAB Group, Inc., Florence, SC)

Basal Salt
Solution Preparation
Prior to the experiment and for the
initial culture and maintenance of the bacterial cultures, two stock
salt solutions, a buffer solution and a stock oxidation/reduction
potential (ORP), and a pH color indication solution were prepared.
All chemicals and salts were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, Inc., St.
Louis, MO. Salt solution A contained (per liter) distilled H2O: 7.3 g (K2HPO4·3H2O). Salt
solution B contained (per liter) distilled H20: 6.0 g (KH2PO4), 12.0 g ((NH4)2SO4), 12.0 g sodium chloride (NaCl), 2.5 g (MgSO4·7H2O), and 1.6 g (CaCl2·H2O). The
ORP solution contained (per 100 mL) distilled H20: 100
μg resazurin as an indicator of anaerobiosis.

To prepare
the salt solution anaerobically, 50 mL of salt solution A and 50 mL
of salt solution B were added to a 1.0 L Erlenmeyer vacuum flask with
a side arm. The flask was topped with a butyl rubber stopper with
one hole drilled through it containing a 6.4 mm diameter stainless
steel tube extending 12.7 mm from the bottom of the flask to 50.8
mm above the stopper. This tube was attached to butyl rubber hosing
in which the anaerobic gas supply was allowed to enter. The side arm
of the flask was fitted with butyl rubber hosing and wrapped with
an aluminum foil allowing gas to escape. Eight hundred and fifty milliliters
of distilled H2O and 1 mL of the stock ORP solution were
added to the flask to visually aid in determining that proper ORP
and pH were achieved. The solution immediately turned from clear to
purple. The combined salt solution was then heated to the boiling
point and allowed to boil for 1 min with continuous gassing. The solution
was then immediately placed in an ice bath while continuing to be
gassed.

A buffering solution was prepared by adding 4 g of
sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) to a 250 mL Erlenmeyer
flask, 50 mL of distilled H2O was then added, and the flask
was covered with an aluminum foil. Attached to anaerobic gas via butyl
rubber hosing, an 18-gauge 22.9 cm needle (model 9875; Cadence Science,
Inc., Lake Success, NY) was then inserted through the foil until the
syringe touched the bottom of the flask. Anaerobic gas was bubbled
through the solution, heated until the boiling point, and then rapidly
cooled in an ice bath as the gas continued to bubble through the solution.
This buffering solution was then transferred to the cooling salt solution
using a pipette that had been repeatedly flushed with anaerobic gas
to limit oxygen contamination during the transfer process. The solution
then turned from blue to bright pink, followed by a bleached pink
coloring. Next, 0.6 g of L–C3H7NO2S–HCl–H2O was added directly to the
flask by cracking the stopper, causing the solution to turn bright
fluorescent pink. This solution, containing the ORP-indicating solution,
the buffering solution, and l-cysteine hydrochloride monohydrate,
remained in an ice bath and continued to be gassed for 1 h until the
solution turned totally clear with an ORP of −250 mV and a
pH of 6.26.

After 1 h of gassing, the flask containing the now
reduced anaerobic salt solution and 15 mL borosilicate septum anaerobic
test tubes (model 2048-18150; Bellco Glass, Vineland, NJ) were gassed
with anaerobic gas using an 18-gauge stainless steel needle as described
before to purge the atmospheric oxygen. Next, 10 mL of the now reduced
anaerobic salt solution was added via a pipette as described before.
The pipette was removed, whereas the needle was still purging the
atmospheric air from the test tube. A butyl rubber stopper was inserted
simultaneously as the needle was removed, and an aluminum septum cap
was mounted and crimped over the test tube. Once all test tubes were
prepared, they were autoclaved for 20 min at 121 °C. The test
tubes were removed from the autoclave, placed in a Precision shaking
water bath (model 51221080; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham,
MA) incubation chamber at 39 °C, and allowed to equilibrate.

Active cultures of C. aminophilum Paster
et al. (ATCC 49906), C. sticklandii Stadtman and McClung. (ATCC 49905),
and P. anaerobius (Natvig) Kluyver
and van Niel (ATCC 27337) were obtained from the USDA, Southern Plains
Agricultural Research Center, Food and Feed Safety Research Unit,
College Station, Texas. For culture maintenance prior to this experiment,
the cultures were maintained anaerobically in a basal broth containing
the reduced and buffered salt solutions and two nutrient sources consisting
of (1) casamino acids (product #C-366; LabScientific, Inc., Livingston,
NJ) as a nitrogen source and (2) Y as a vitamin source (product Y-766;
LabScientific, Inc., Livingston, NJ). The nitrogen solution contained
15 g of casamino acids per 50 mL of distilled H2O. The
vitamin solution contained 15 g of Y per 50 mL of distilled water.
The technique to prepare the two nutrient solutions was the same as
that of buffer solution with the exception that the solution was anaerobically
pipetted into a 125 mL anaerobic jar (model 2048-18151; Bellco Glass,
Vineland, NJ) and then autoclaved as before. Cultures were individually
maintained every 72 h by anaerobically adding 1 mL of casamino acids
and 1 mL of Y to a 10 mL salt solution test tube using aseptic techniques.
The test tubes were individually inoculated with 0.5 mL of 18 h mid-log
phase bacterial inoculants using an anaerobically purged 21-gauge
syringe 38.1 mm needle (model 305274; Becton, Dickinson and Co., Franklin
Lakes, NJ) and placed in a heated water bath at 39 °C.

Each bacterium has specific amino acids and total N requirements
for optimal growth and BAA production (Table 1). Data in Table 1 are not the specific requirements for bacterial
growth but amino acid composition of the different nitrogen-rich organic
substrates. The following nitrogen-rich organic substrates containing
various concentrations of these amino acids (as verified by independent
lab analysis: ISO 13903:2005) were utilized: DF (hydrolyzed fish protein
powder, California Spray Dry, Colo., Stockton, CA); FM (Boer Commodities,
Inc., Fresno, CA); BM (Phyta-Grow Big Red 13-0-0; California Organic
Fertilizers, Inc., Fresno, CA); SPI (Soy-N-Ergy ISP 90; NewOrganics,
LLC., Ann Arbor, MI); and Y (product 3011; Savoury Systems International,
Inc., Branchburg, NJ) (Table 1).

Y contains growth-enhancing vitamins according to
Salanitro et al.12 and Wilkins and Chalgren;13 therefore, all N substrates were tested with
and without Y to test this effect. During the preparation of the individual
treatments and prior to sterilization, 0.1 g of each of the substrates
was added to the anaerobic test tubes with 10 mL of the anaerobic-reduced
salt solution and capped as before. The treatments were then sterilized
and placed in the water bath and allowed to equilibrate at 39 °C
prior to inoculation as before. For this experiment, the ammonium
sulfate in salt solution B was excluded. The experimental unit sample
consisted of two test tubes for each treatment, and each treatment
was replicated twice at 39 °C for a total of 168 h.

BAA Analysis
For the measurement of BAA production, 0.5 mL aliquots of cultures
were removed anaerobically with an anaerobically purged syringe as
described before at 24 and 96 h and immediately stored at −20
°C until analysis. Prior to determining BAA production, the samples
were removed from the freezer, allowed to thaw to room temperature,
particulates were allowed to settle to the bottom of the syringe,
and the supernatant was removed for the analysis. Time 0 samples were
analyzed for BAA and were nondetectable. Ammonia concentrations were
determined by the colorimetric method of Chaney and Marbach,14 as modified by Cotta and Russell.15 This method was modified again by maximizing
the standard curve and diluting the samples by a factor of 3. Each
sample for each rep was run three separate times as independent syringe
samples and then analyzed to obtain an accurate reading. Ammonia concentrations
were measured with a Molecular Devices SpectraMax Plus 384 spectrophotometer
microplate reader at 630 nm–1 (Molecular Devices,
Devices, MDS Analytical Technologies, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA).

C. aminophilum SPI Rate Study
For determining
the maximum BAA efficiency by C. aminophilum, the increasing rates of SPI in 10 mL salt solutions were arranged
in a completely randomized block design within the test tube racks
with two replications and two tubes per treatment. SPI was weighed
and placed in anaerobic test tubes in 0.1 g increments from 0.1 g
to 1.0 g·10 mL–1 salt solution. Then, 10 mL
of the reduced anaerobic salt solution was added with a pipette as
described before in the first experiment. The pipette was removed,
while the needle was still purging the atmospheric air from the test
tube. A butyl rubber stopper was inserted simultaneously as the needle
was removed, and an aluminum septum cap was mounted and crimped over
the test tube. Once all test tubes were prepared, they were autoclaved
for 20 min at 121 °C (model STM-EL; Market Forge Co., Everett,
MA). The test tubes were removed from the autoclave, placed in a precision
water bath (model 51221080; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham,
MA) incubation chamber at 39 °C, and allowed to equilibrate.
The test tubes were individually inoculated with 0.5 mL of 18 h mid-log
phase stock C. aminophilum culture
using an anaerobically purged syringe needle as before and placed
randomly within the test tube racks and placed back into the water
bath.

For the measurement of BAA production, 0.5 mL aliquots
of treatment cultures were removed with an anaerobically purged syringe
as described before at 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, and 168 h, respectively,
and immediately stored at −20 °C until analysis. Prior
to determining BAA production, the samples were removed from the freezer,
allowed to thaw to ambient room temperature, and particulates settled
to the bottom of the syringe before the supernatant was removed for
the analysis. BAA concentrations were determined by the colorimetric
method of Chaney and Marbach,14 as modified
by Cotta and Russell.15 This method was
modified in the first experiment by maximizing the standard curve
and diluting the samples by a factor of 3. This method was modified
again in the SPI rate experiment by diluting the samples by a factor
of 6 because of the outlying data points on the standard curve observed
during the spectrophotometric analysis in the first experiment. Each
sample for each rep was independently sampled three separate times
to obtain an accurate reading. Concentrations of BAA were measured
spectrophotometrically with a microplate reader at 630 nm–1 (model SpectraMax Plus 384; Molecular Devices, MDS Analytical Technologies,
Inc., Sunnyvale, CA).

Statistical Analysis
All data were
analyzed using the MSTAT-C version 1 (Mich. State Univ., East Lansing,
MI) using ANOVA. The three-way ANOVA, with independent variables being
time, HAP species, and N source, was partitioned into individual sources
of variation in the model to determine the relative importance of
each source of variation. In the SPI rate study, data were then subjected
to polynomial regression using SigmaPlot (Systat Software Inc., San
Jose, CA) to see how the SPI rate affected BAA production over time.
Appropriate regression models for each rate were then selected based
on incremental regression significant P values at
a defined level of significance of P < 0.05 that
best explained the data.
