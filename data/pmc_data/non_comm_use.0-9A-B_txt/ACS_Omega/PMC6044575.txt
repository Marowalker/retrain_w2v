Diverse series of
isatin–ferrocene conjugates were synthesized
via Cu-promoted azide–alkyne cycloaddition reaction with an
aim of probing their antiproliferative structure–activity relationship
against MCF-7 (estrogen receptor positive) and MDA-MB-231 (triple
negative) cell lines. Among the synthesized conjugates, isatin–ferrocenes
proved to be more potent against MCF-7, whereas ferrocenylmethoxy–isatins
exhibited activity against MDA-MB-231 cell lines. However, the introduction
of chalcone moiety among these hybrids resulted in the complete loss
of activity against the tested cell lines, as evident by isatin–ferrocenylchalcones.
The conjugates 5a and 9c proved to be the
most potent among the series against MCF-7 and MDA-MB-213 cell lines,
exhibiting IC50 values of 31.62 and 20.26 μM, respectively.

Introduction
Cancer, characterized
by abnormal growth of cells, is the second
most fatal disease in the world. The use of tobacco, over body weight,
gene mutation, and hormone and immune conditions are few driving forces
responsible for the emergence of this deadly disease.1 Breast cancer is considered one of the most common cancers
with a high rate of mortality.2 Formation
of lumps in the breast tissue is the prevalent symptom of breast cancer,
while less common symptoms may include persistent changes in the breast
such as thickness, swelling, distortion, and spontaneous nipple discharge.1 In United States, 30% of women are expected to
develop breast cancer over their lifetime, with an expected 40 610
breast cancer-related deaths in 2017.3 The
efficacy of current chemotherapeutics against breast cancer is low,
and significant improvements are achieved only in 30–40% of
the patients.4 Worldwide, medicinal chemists
are striving to discover novel, effectual, and less toxic antibreast
cancer agents which can expand the success spectrum among cancer cases.

Isatin (1H-indole-2,3-dione) is a privileged scaffold
present endogenously in both human and other mammalian tissues. The
molecular architecture of isatin is indeed an ideal platform for carrying
out structural modification and derivatization to probe its further
biological potential.5 Isatin derivatives
have been reported to exhibit a range of biological properties such
as anticancer,6 antidepressant,7 anticonvulsant,8 antifungal,9 antiHIV,10 and antiinflammatory11 activities. The Food and Drug Administration
approval of SU11248 (SUTENT), a 5-fluoro-3-substituted isatin derivative
for the treatment of advanced renal carcinoma and gastrointestinal
stromal tumors, has established isatin as a potentially useful lead
for anticancer drug development.12 C-5-
and C-6-substituted isatin analogues were selective monoamine oxidase
B inhibitors, with 5-(4-phenylbutyl)isatin being 18 500-fold
more potent than the parent molecule.13 A number of reports have appeared lately on the anticancer activities
of isatin conjugates, which proved them to be more efficient than
cis-platin.14 Tyrosine kinase inhibition,
inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases, and/or caspase inhibition
are some pathways through which isatin has been reported to exhibit
its anticancer potential.15

The application
of bioorganometallic chemistry in medicine, especially
via the inclusion of the ferrocene nucleus among organic frameworks,
is a rapidly developing area of research.15b Numerous studies have suggested that the replacement of an aryl
ring with a ferrocenyl moiety has improved the biological activities
of the heterocyclic scaffolds or has fashioned new medicinal properties.17 The most emblematic example of such a strategy
could be of ferrocifen, obtained via replacement of one of the phenyl
rings of tamoxifen with ferrocene, resulting in the development of
the earliest organometallic selective estrogen receptor modulators.
Ferrocifen displayed an uncommon feature of being antiproliferative
against both hormone-dependent (MCF-7) and hormone-independent (MDA-MB-231)
breast cancer cell lines. Such a dual mode of action underlines the
importance of replacing the aryl ring with ferrocene because the purely
organic form exhibited antiestrogenic activity only against MCF-7
cell lines.18

With an aim of discovering
varied biologically relevant molecular
conjugates,19 the present manuscript is
one of our endeavors toward targeting breast cancer which includes
the synthesis of a series of 1H-1,2,3-triazole-linked
isatin–ferrocene, ferrocenylmethoxy–isatin, and isatin–ferrocenyl–chalcone
conjugates, as depicted in Figure 1. These molecules were evaluated for their antiproliferative
activities against estrogen receptor positive (ER+) MCF-7 cells and
triple negative (ER−) MDA-MB-231 cells. 1H-1,2,3-Triazole core has drawn considerable attention in the field
of medicinal chemistry mainly because of its capability of forming
H-bonds, which eventually improves its solubility and interaction
with biomolecular targets. The stability toward metabolic degradation
as well as varied biological activities make 1H-1,2,3-triazole
a privileged scaffold which can be used as a linker in the molecular-hybridization
approach.20

Results and Discussion
Synthetic methodology for obtaining the desired isatin–ferrocene
conjugate 5 involved an initial base-promoted N-alkylation
of 5-substituted isatin 1 with methyl iodide or benzyl
bromide in dry dimethyl formamide to yield N-alkylated isatin 2 which was subsequently reacted with trimethylsilyl iodide
to afford spiroindoline-oxirane-2-ones 3. Epoxide ring
opening of 3 with sodium azide in an ethanol/water (90:10)
mixture afforded 3-(azidomethyl)-3-hydroxy-indolin-2-one 4. Cu-promoted azide–alkyne cycloaddition of 4 with ethynyl ferrocene resulted in the formation of a crude product
which was purified by column chromatography using (10:90) a methanol/chloroform
mixture as the eluent to afford the desired 1H-1,2,3-triazole-tethered
isatin–ferrocene conjugate 5 in good yields (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Synthesis of 1H-1,2,3-Triazole-Linked Isatin–Ferrocene
Conjugates 5a–h
Another precursor, viz., O-propargylated
ferrocene
methanol 8, required for ferrocenylmethoxy–isatin
conjugates, was synthesized via NaBH4-promoted reduction
of ferrocene carboxaldehyde 6 in dry tetrahydrofuran
to afford ferrocene methanol 7 with subsequent O-propargylation using sodium hydride. Cu-promoted azide–alkyne
cycloaddition reaction of 4 with O-propargylated-ferrocene
methanol 8 led to the isolation of a crude solid, which
was purified via column chromatography using a CHCl3/methanol
(95:5) mixture as the eluent, to yield the desired conjugate 9 in good yields (Scheme 2). The structure to the synthesized conjugate was assigned
on the basis of spectral studies and analytical evidence. The compound,
for example 9a, exhibited a molecular ion peak at 351.1457
in its high resolution mass spectrum. Its proton nuclear magnetic
resonance (1H NMR) spectrum showed the presence of a singlet
at δ 4.18, corresponding to 5H (cyclopentadiene ring of ferrocene),
along with singlets at δ 4.33 (2H) and 4.61 (2H) because of
the ferrocene ring protons. The appearance of a pair of singlets at
δ 4.18 (2H) and 4.26 (2H), corresponding to O–CH2, along with a characteristic singlet at δ 7.74 (1H)
because of the triazole ring proton confirmed the assigned structure.
The appearance of absorption peaks at δ 68.6, 68.7, 69.6, and
75.1 due to ferrocene ring carbons along with the presence of absorption
peak δ 175.3 due to the isatin ring carbonyl in the 13C NMR spectrum further corroborated the assigned structure.

Scheme 2 Synthesis
of 1H-1,2,3-Triazole-Linked Ferrocenylmethoxy–Isatin
Conjugates 9a–h
A precursor, viz., O-propargylated ferrocenyl
chalcone 12, was prepared via an initial propargylation
of 4-hydroxyacetophenone 10 to yield 11,
which was subjected to aldol condensation with ferrocene–carboxaldehyde 8. Cu-promoted azide–alkyne cycloaddition reaction
between 3-(azidomethyl)-3-hydroxy-indolin-2-one 4 and 12 afforded the desired 1H-1,2,3-triazole-tethered
isatin–ferrocenylchalcone conjugate 13, as depicted
in Scheme 3, the structure
to which were again assigned on the basis of spectral data and analytical
evidences.

Scheme 3 Synthesis of 1H-1,2,3-Triazole-Linked
Isatin–Ferrocenylchalcone
Conjugates 13a–h
The synthesized 1H-1,2,3-triazole-tethered
isatin–ferrocene,
ferrocenylmethoxy–isatin, and isatin–ferrocenylchalcone
conjugates were then evaluated for their antiproliferative activities
against MCF-7 (ER+) and MDA-MB-231 (ER−) human breast cancer
cell lines using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-z-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay. The percentages of growth inhibition of MCF-7
and MDA-MB-231 cells were recorded at varying concentrations of the
synthesized conjugates, and the results are depicted in Figures S13–S19
(Supporting Information), using plumbagin
as the positive control. IC50 values, which is the concentration
required to inhibit the growth of 50% of the cells by the test compounds,
is summarized in Table 1. As evident, the compounds proved to be more active or cytotoxic
to MCF-7 cells compared to MDA-MB-231 cells. A closer inspection of Table 1 revealed an interesting
structure–activity relationship, with antiproliferative activities
being dependent upon the basic framework of the synthesized conjugates.
1H-1,2,3-Triazole-tethered isatin–ferrocene
conjugates, 5a, 5e, 5f, and 5h, proved to be potent against MCF-7 cell lines compared
to MDA-MB-231 cell lines, exhibiting IC50 values of 31.62,
53.48, 57.10, and 34.99 μM, respectively. In particular, the
conjugate 5a exhibited selectivity against the MCF-7
over the MDA-MB-231 cell line, where a concentration of 97.11 μM
is needed to inhibit the growth. 1H-1,2,3-Triazole-tethered
ferrocenylmethoxy–isatin conjugates, viz., 9b, 9c, and 9f, on the other hand, showed selectivity
against the MDA-MB-231 over MCF-7 cell lines, as evident by their
low IC50 values. 9b, 9c, and 9f exhibited IC50 values of 45.67, 20.26, and 38.29
μM, respectively, against the ER– cell line, whereas
IC50 values of 70.31, 67.34, and 78.30 μM were observed
against the ER+ cell line, with an exception being 5h, which proved to be effective against both ER+ as well as ER–
cell lines, exhibiting IC50s of 34.99 and 33.73 μM,
respectively. The introduction of the chalcone moiety among isatin–ferrocene
conjugates, viz., 13a–h, reduced the antiproliferative
activities, with conjugate 13h proving to be ineffective
against both the cell lines. The loss of activity with the inclusion
of the chalcone moiety among the synthesized hybrids could be attributed
to its reported induction of cytoprotective enzymes.21 The log p values for all the tested conjugates
were also calculated (Table S1) and were
lower than 5.0, indicative of the fact that the compounds are not
lipophilic.

Conclusions
A
series of isatin–ferrocene, ferrocenylmethoxy–isatin,
and isatin–ferrocenylchalcone conjugates were synthesized via
a Cu-promoted azide–alkyne cycloaddition reaction along with
the evaluation of their antiproliferative activities against MCF-7
(ER+) and MDA-MB-231 (ER−) cell lines. The activity data revealed
the ferrocenylmethoxy–isatins to be more selective against
ER– cell lines, and thus, it can open up avenues for further
investigation into this type of molecular framework for developing
targeted therapies against ER– breast cancer. Furthermore,
isatin–ferrocene conjugates exhibited selectivity against the
ER+ cell line, and further modifications may prove useful for treating
about 70% of all breast cancer patients. It would also be useful to
test these compounds against tamoxifen-resistant cell lines in future
to examine if these compounds have the ability to inhibit the growth
of tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells.

Experimental Section
General
Information
Melting points were determined
by an open capillary using a Veego precision digital melting point
apparatus (MP-D) and are uncorrected. 1H NMR spectra were
recorded in CDCl3 with a Bruker AVANCE II (500 MHz) spectrometer
using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal standard. Chemical shift
values are expressed as parts per million downfield from TMS, and
the J values are in hertz. Splitting patterns are
indicated as s: singlet, d: doublet, t: triplet, m: multiplet, dd:
double doublet, ddd: doublet of a doublet of a doublet, and br: broad
peak. 13C NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 with a Bruker AVANCE II (125 MHz) spectrometer using TMS as the
internal standard. Mass spectra were recorded on a Bruker high resolution
mass spectrometer (micrOTOF-QII). Elemental analyses were performed
on a Heraeus CHN-O-Rapid elemental analyzer.20e Column chromatography
was performed on a silica gel (60–120 mesh) using an ethyl
chloroform/hexane mixture as the eluent.

Procedure for the Synthesis
of Isatin–Ferrocene Conjugates
(5a–h)
Copper sulfate (0.05 mmol) and
sodium ascorbate (0.13 mmol) were added to a well-stirred solution
of ethynyl ferrocene (1 mmol) and N-alkylazido-isatin 4 (1 mmol) in an ethanol/water (90:10) mixture.20e The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature
for 10–12 h, and the progress was monitored via thin-layer
chromatography (TLC). On completion, water (20 mL) was added, and
the extractions were carried out with dichloromethane (2 × 30
mL). The combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous sodium
sulfate and concentrated under vacuum to yield a crude product 5, which was purified via column chromatography using a 10:90
(methanol/chloroform) mixture.

Procedure for the Synthesis
of Ferrocenylmethoxy–Isatin
Conjugates (9a–h)
Copper sulfate (0.05
mmol) and sodium ascorbate (0.13 mmol) were added to a stirred solution
of O-propargylated ferrocenyl-methanol 8 (1 mmol) and N-alkylazido-isatin 4 (1 mmol) in
an ethanol/water (95:5) mixture. The reaction mixture was allowed
to stir for 6–8 h at room temperature, and the progress was
monitored via TLC. Water (20 mL) was added, and the reaction mixture
was extracted with dichloromethane (2 × 30 mL). The combined
organic layers were dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated
under reduced pressure to yield a crude product 9, which
was purified via column chromatography using a 5:95 (methanol/chloroform)
mixture.

Procedure for the Synthesis of Isatin–Ferreocenylchalcone
Conjugates (13a–h)
To a stirred solution
of ferrocenyl chalcone 12 (1 mmol) and N-alkylated-azido-isatin 4 (1 mmol) in an ethanol/water
mixture, were added copper sulfate (0.05 mmol) and sodium ascorbate
(0.13 mmol). The reaction mixture was allowed to stir at room temperature
for 8–10 h. After completion, as evident by TLC, water (20
mL) was added, and the extraction was carried out with dichloromethane
(2 × 30 mL). The combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous
sodium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure to yield a
crude product 13, which was purified via column chromatography
using a 5:95 (methanol/chloroform) mixture.

Materials and Methods
The cytotoxicity of conjugates,
viz., 5a–h, 9a–h, and 13a–h, was tested on two different breast cancer cell
lines, namely, ER+ MCF-7 cells and triple negative MDA-MB-231 (ER−)
using MTT assay.22

Cell Culturing
MCF-7 cells were cultured in complete
Dulbecco’s media Eagle’s medium (DMEM) with 5% fetal
bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin, and MDA-MB-231
cells were cultured in 3:1 DMEM and Ham’s F12 with 10% FBS
and 1% penicillin–streptomycin; both cell lines were incubated
at 37 °C and 5% carbon dioxide.

Methods
Cells
were seeded in 96-well plates at a density
of 5000 cells per well in triplicate in media. After 24 h, the test
compounds [dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide with concentration <0.2%]
diluted in DMEM were added to each well. Cells were treated with a
range of different concentrations of the drug (1, 5, 10, 20, 50, and
100 μM). Following a 24 h incubation with the test compounds,
sterile 5 mg/mL MTT (Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in phosphate-buffered
saline was added to each well and incubated with cells for 2 h. Solubilization
solution (10% sodium dodecyl sulfate and 10 mM HCl) of equal volume
to the wells was then added to each well, which was incubated with
cells for 16 h at 37 °C. The optical density of each well at
570 nm was determined using a microtiter plate reader (Tecan Sunrise
microplate reader, Magellan software).

Statistical Analysis
The statistical analysis was performed
using Excel, and IC50 values were estimated using GraphPad
Prism 5 software (Hearne Scientific Software). The experiments were
performed in duplicate, and the statistical significance was calculated
using Student’s t-test. A p-value of less than 0.05 was used to estimate the significance of
the observations. A Z-factor23 was calculated for each 96-well plate, and assays having the Z-factor >0.5 were included in the statistical analysis.24
