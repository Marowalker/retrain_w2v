Physicochemical studies on aqueous
mixtures of ionic liquids (ILs)
and reverse pluronics are limited. Self-aggregation dynamics and microstructure
of a surface-active IL (SAIL), 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium octylsulfate
[C4mim] [C8OSO3], in the presence
of a reverse pluronic, PO8EO22PO8 (known as 10R5), were studied using isothermal titration calorimetry
(ITC), high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and small-angle
neutron scattering (SANS) methods. Also, cryo-/freeze-fracture transmission
electron microscopy was employed to determine the microstructures
of SAIL/10R5 mixtures. The ITC and NMR results revealed facilitation
of SAIL aggregation in the presence of 10R5 forming mixed aggregates
as well as free SAIL micelles. 2H spin relaxation rate
data pointed out the onset of slow dynamics of the aqueous SAIL/10R5
mixture with an increase in either the former or the latter. Globular
morphologies of the mixed species as well as their individual components
were corroborated from the measurements. The preferential location
of interaction of the SAIL with the 10R5 was identified from 13C NMR chemical shift findings to be in the interfacial region
of the assembled SAIL. The formed species were mixed interacted aggregates
but not mixed micelles that arise from mixed surfactants. The physicochemical
information acquired herein would enrich the literature on the 10R5/SAIL
mixed microheterogeneous systems having importance in the making of
useful green drug carrier systems and templates for the synthesis
of nanomaterials.

Introduction
Green technology requires
new solvents to replace common organic
solvents having inherent toxicity and high volatility, leading to
delivering volatile organic compounds to the atmosphere.1−8 Ionic liquids (ILs) or molten salts commonly consisting of low-symmetry
organic cations and inorganic/organic anions are held together via
weak electrostatic interactions (reducing the lattice energy of salts
and exhibiting low melting points).1−8 Furthermore, their physical and chemical properties can be fine-tuned
by the appropriate selection of constituent cations and anions, making
them as candidates for a broad range of applications, viz., solar
cells, fuel cells, lithium-ion batteries, and so forth. In general,
ILs are recognized as environmental benign alternatives to volatile
organic solvents for a wide variety of physical and chemical (biochemical)
processes, viz., separation, purification, catalysis, electrochemistry,
self-assembly formation, and so forth.9−11 Surface-active ILs are
abbreviated as SAILs; they are known to form aggregates in aqueous,
nonaqueous, and even in surface-inactive IL media.

Information
on the functionalization of ILs and their compatibility
with stimuli-responsive polymers is available in the literature.12−15 Although uses of IL–polymer combinations forming compatible
components are limited, stimuli-responsive synthetic and commercial
polymers that may undergo changes in properties in solution to external
stimuli in the presence of ILs are now being recognized as a novel
platform for creating intelligent soft materials. Combinations of
macromolecules and ILs (as solvents and additives) could offer a change
(improve) in the solution properties of polymers to enrich the field
of soft science. ILs are “designer solvents” having
nonvolatility and wide liquid temperature range; they are smart wet
materials that can be employed in an open atmosphere over a prolonged
time period, permitting wide temperature and pressure conditions.
They also offer scope in designing colloidal systems with matching
properties such as, refractive index and density, which are important
for scattering and imaging studies.

Pluronics are triblock copolymers
like PEO/PPO/PEO [PEO, poly(ethylene
oxide) and PPO, poly(propylene oxide)];16,17 in reverse
pluronics, the configurations of the blocks are opposite, that is,
PPO/PEO/PPO.18,19 Reverse pluronics have versatile
applications, viz., in detergency, drug delivery, dispersion stabilization,
lubrication, cosmetic formulation, emulsification, food packaging,
rechargeable batteries, tissue engineering, coating and painting,
nanoparticle synthesis, and so forth; they are of minimal immune response.18 Their self-aggregation and microstructure in
solution are related to the concentration and temperature that influence
their hydrophobic/hydrophilic characters. Because of varied solubility
of the building blocks, these polymers may show different self-assembly
formations in solution. Below the critical micelle temperature (CMT),
both the pluronics are soluble in water in their monomeric forms.
At the critical micelle concentration (cmc) as well as at the CMT,
they form self-assembled microstructures.16,17 Self-aggregation properties of reverse pluronics are different from
normal pluronics.18−20 Pluronics in combination with surfactants are known
to achieve better colloidal formulations and properties. The self-aggregation
behaviors of copolymers in the presence of surfactants, organic additives,
and inorganic additives are reported.21,22

Self-aggregation
behaviors of SAILs in the presence of triblock
copolymers in aqueous solution are also reported.12−15,23−26 Vekariya et al.13 investigated the effect
of an isotropic micellar phase of a pluronic (P123) in the presence
and absence of alkylpyridinum halide-based SAILs. The change in the
dimension of the micelle as a function of alkyl chain length, concentration,
and halides is also evaluated. Umapathi and Venkatesu15 recently studied the effect of ILs on the aggregation behavior
of pluronic F108. They show that the ability of ILs to affect the
CMT of the copolymers results not only from the charge and size of
the anions of the ILs but also from the weak ion–ion interactions
in the IL. Studies on a mixed system of copolymer P123 and SAIL (1-pentyl-3-methylimidazolium
tetrafluoroborate) reveal that the IL penetrates into the hydrophobic
core of P123 micelles at lower concentrations and then invades both
the core and the corona region with nearly the same efficiency.27 The same phenomena is observed in the system
of copolymer P104 and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide.12 Ge et al.14 studied
the aggregation behavior of pluronic F127 in the presence of a new
kind of double-tailed SAIL (1,3-dioctylimidazolium bromide). Nevertheless,
investigations pertaining to self-aggregation and microstructure of
reverse pluronics in the presence of self-associating molecules (such
as SAILs) are still limited.

Imidazolium alkyl sulfate-based
room-temperature ILs are recognized
for their halogen-free, nontoxic, and hydrolysis stable properties.2 Their physicochemical properties are well-documented
in the literature.5 The SAIL, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium
octylsulfate, from the above family was chosen for its superior properties
compared to the halide counterparts.2 Thakkar
et al. provided information on the aggregation of 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazole
octylsulfates and their interaction with Triton X-100 micelles.28 In fact, interaction studies of reverse pluronics
with ILs using various physicochemical methods are significantly low.
In light of the current growing interest in the interaction between
SAILs and reverse pluronics, we have studied the pair, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium
octylsulfate ([C4mim] [C8OSO3]) and
the reverse pluronic 10R5 (PO8EO22PO8), by the isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR), small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), and cryo-/freeze-fracture
transmission electron microscopy (Cryo-/FF-TEM) techniques. We have
addressed the following points: (i) monitoring the self-aggregation
dynamics of the SAIL in the presence of 10R5 and (ii) examining the
types of morphologies exhibited by the SAIL/10R5 mixtures at some
specified compositions. The nature of such studies is only limitedly
found in the literature. A comprehensive separate study using different
types of SAILs in combination with different types of reverse pluronics
could also be a potential domain for exploration to be taken up in
future.

Results and Discussion
ITC of SAIL and Its Mixture with 10R5
The molecular
structure of the SAIL is presented in Figure 1. ITC enthalphograms for 0, 20, 50, and 100
mM 10R5 as a function of aqueous [SAIL] at 303 K are presented in Figure 2. ITC evidences a
break at 54.9 mM for aqueous SAIL alone, and it is considered as the
cmc of [C4mim] [C8OSO3], which is
consistent with the value obtained from NMR chemical shifts reported
elsewhere.24 The present NMR data (vide
infra) have also indicated the cmc break at 40 mM (at 298 K), and
the lower value of the cmc is the consequence of lower temperature
(298 K) in NMR than that in ITC (aggregation tendency of ionic surfactants
may decrease with increasing temperature in the lower range). In the
presence of 20 mM 10R5, the SAIL at 303 K exhibits two distinct inflections/breaks
at 30.4 and 63.5 mM (Figure 2); the former is the critical aggregation concentration (CAC)
that is the formation of small micelles induced by the polymer, which
get attached to the polymer. On completion of binding, free micelles
are formed in solution, which corresponds to the extended critical
micelle concentration (cmce). Both CAC and cmce are [10R5] dependent. At 20, 50, and 100 mM of the polymer, the
CAC values are 30.4, 37.9, and 53.5 mM of [SAIL], respectively; the
corresponding cmce values are 63.5, 71.4, and 85.9 mM,
respectively (Table 1). The CAC and cmce dependences on [10R5] are fairly linear
(not illustrated). The increasing trends herein found are normally
observed for surfactant–nonionic polymer systems.29,30 The increasing presence of the SAIL makes the enthalpy profiles
more endothermic. The induced micelles start forming at the CAC progressively
bind to the SAIL till the cmce point is reached. The difference
in the enthalpy between cmce and CAC, that is, (ΔHcmce – ΔHCAC), is the total enthalpy change for binding (ΔHBind) of small micelles to 10R5. These values
for 20, 50, and 100 mM 10R5 are found to be 1.02, 0.75, and 1.10 kJ
mol–1, respectively. They are close which is expected
for the same system in identical environments; the concentration effect
has only a minor say on the enthalpy of the binding process.

each of 20, 50, and 100 mM 10R5, the first transition point is CAC
and the second transition point is cmce as marked in the
graphs. For pure SAIL (curve with blue symbol), the transition point
is the cmc.

We may herein discuss the results of a recent study23 of cationic (SAIL) alkyl imidazolium chloride
of varied chain lengths with 10R5. There three breaks are found instead
of two, which occur in conventional surfactant and water-soluble nonionic
polymer systems.30 We have observed two
breaks instead of three; the anionic IL used here has a different
self-assembling property with 10R5. We may mention here that the method
used in the referred study23 where turbidimetry
showed distinct three breaks, the other methods conductometry, calorimetry,
and fluorimetry showed two breaks, and the second break in tensiometry
was very weak, and the [SAIL] profile in tensiometry was way off from
expectation.23 The above reported deviation
from normal warrants confirmation by further studies.

1H Self-Diffusion and Spin-Relaxation Study of IL/10R5/D2O Mixtures
Translational self-diffusion (SD) and
spin-relaxation are versatile NMR techniques useful for probing both
global and local dynamics, which can infer reliable information of
self-aggregation and microstructure of polymer–surfactant systems.31−33 Earlier studies revealed nonaggregation of 10R5 at 298 K.19 Self-aggregation may, on the other hand, occur
at higher concentrations and temperatures18,21,34 (cmc = 234 mM at 303 K34 and 30 mM at 323 K18). The cmc
values of 10R5 at different temperatures are found elsewhere.211H and 13C chemical shift
assignments made for both SAIL24 in D2O (see Figure S1) and 10R5 based
on triblock copolymer systems are reported elsewhere.35 Interestingly, our NMR spin–lattice relaxation rate
(R1), spin–spin relaxation rate
(R2), and SD data signature visibly break
around 20 mM (Figure S2) at 298 K, which
suggests some sort of association of 10R5 molecules [may be a premicelle
type of aggregation-like sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS), etc.]. Star-shape
flakelike species with low aggregation number may also occur (Naskar
et al.18); this observation necessitates
further study.

1H SD coefficients (DIL) for various protons of SAIL/D2O as a function
of [SAIL] are measured (Figure 3A). In the presence of 10R5, a noticeable diffusional change
in anionic α-CH2 relative to cationic α-CH2 of the SAIL is observed (see Table S1). Anionic α-CH2 protons of the SAIL are used in
the diffusion analysis (Figure 3A). DIL is weakly sensitive to
[SAIL] till 40 mM; later, it is perceptively responsive to the concentration.
Thus, 40 mM is taken as the cmc of the SAIL, and it is consistent
with the value obtained from 1H NMR spin-relaxation (Figure S3) and also in an earlier report.24 The presence of 20 mM 10R5 noticeably affects
the DIL of the SAIL. The added polymer
decreases the DIL, and this tendency enhances
with a further rise in [10R5] (20–50 mM); the CAC and cmce breaks (indicated with arrowheads) are shifted to higher
concentrations. Thus, the NMR results support the findings of ITC
(Figure 2). All of
the above diffusion inferences are well-corroborated with that of 1H spin–lattice relaxation rate (R1) data shown in Figure S3 (CAC
and cmce are not marked therein). A compilation of self-aggregation
pertinent parameters obtained from ITC and NMR is presented in Table 1. It may be noted
that for pure SAIL, the cmc formation is distinctly visible with appreciable
slope changes of D. In the presence of 10R5, initially,
the CAC forms with a less change in the slope (for the formed induced
micelles are small). At cmce, in addition to monomers and
small micelles, larger micelles start to form. In overall respect,
there a large change in the slope is also not expected; hence, the
change is moderate.

mM) system
and (B) 13C chemical shifts of IL for IL (200 mM)/10R5/D2O relative to IL (200 mM)/D2O that is Δδ
(=δ10R5+IL – δIL) as a function
of [10R5] (all NMR measurements at 298 K).

In order to evaluate the free fraction (pf) of IL in the IL/10R5/D2O mixture, a prior
knowledge
of both Df and Db is essential (see eqs 1−1a). In this regard, a low concentration
(5 mM) of IL, well below its cmc (40 mM), was used to measure D noted to be 6.67 (±0.01) × 10–10 m2/s, which was considered as Df, whereas Db was observed using
tetramethylsilane (TMS) an external probe in the ternary mixtures,
I–III, as it solubilizes in the hydrophobic portions of the
mixed aggregates/micelles.36 In the present
study, we assume that the intermolecular interactions are weak as
the concentrations of both IL (200 mM) and 10R5 (200 mM) used were
much lower (not that high to make strong interaction of the formed
aggregated species). In this regard, the influence of intermicellar
interactions to diffusion37 is not accounted.
The obtained diffusion coefficients for mixtures I–III are
1.21 (±0.01), 0.89 (±0.01), and 0.97 (±0.01) ×
10–10 m2/s, respectively. The value of pf is found from the knowledge of Df, Db, and D (see eq 1a), and such
a procedure is reported elsewhere.31,38 The results
are displayed in Figure S4. From the above
diffusion data [using the viscosity (η) of D2O at
298 K39 = 1.1 mPa s], the corresponding RH (using eq 2) values for mixtures I–III are 16.5, 22.4,
and 20.5 Å. The observed value of RH for mixture I fairly matches with the reported values of 14.1 Å
by DLS40 and 13.5 Å by SANS.28 From the RH values,
it may be concluded that the sizes of 10R5/SAIL mixed aggregates are
not significantly different from the SAIL micelles; the microstructure
of free IL micelle is essentially comparable with the 10R5/IL mixed
aggregates.

2H NMR Spin-Relaxation of IL/10R5/H2O
Mixtures
NMR spin-relaxation, in particular, 1H R1 and R2 data are sensitive to both inter-
and intramolecular dipolar interactions, which complicates 1H spin-relaxation analysis.31,41 In this regard, 2H spin-relaxation rates (R2 =
1/T2) and (R1 = 1/T1) and their difference ΔR (=R2 – R1) plotted against both the concentration and temperature
yield reliable information on the self-aggregation of surfactants
in the presence of polymers, as 2H senses intramolecular
interactions.32,33,41 In the present study, ternary mixtures of SAIL-α-d2/10R5/H2O with specific compositions have been investigated
using 2H NMR as a probe and the data are presented in Table 2. A close inspection
of 2H data (Table 2) reveals the following: (i) unimeric IL (20 mM) when combines
with relatively lower [10R5] (∼50 mM) exhibits ΔR ≈ 0, pointing out disfavor of aggregation, whereas
at higher [10R5], a nonzero value of ΔR (∼4)
suggests the presence of random/local aggregates, (ii) upon raising
[SAIL] from 20 to 50 mM does not favor aggregation at lower [10R5]
(∼20 mM), but an increase in [10R5] by an order of magnitude
(∼200 mM) results a finite ΔR (∼5)
evidencing signature of local aggregates, and (iii) the combination
of 10R5 with micellized SAIL (>cmc) results finite ΔR (∼6) also indicating random/local aggregates. In
general, notable changes in ΔR are indications
of the formation of nonspherical aggregates such as ellipsoids and
rodlike. However, the weak changes in ΔR indicate
spherical/globular shapes supplemented by Cryo-/FF-TEM (vide-infra).
It is noted that the presence of random aggregates arises from the
interaction between the hydrophobic regions of PPO and the IL anion.

13C NMR Chemical Shift of IL/10R5/D2O
Mixtures
13C chemical shifts (Δδ′s)
of proton–carbon of the IL in the mixtures, 200 mM SAIL/10R5/D2O relative to 200 mM SAIL/D2O, are monitored as
a function of [10R5] and displayed in Figure 3B. The SAIL carbons C1a, C2a, C3a, C8a, C2c,
C4c, C5c, C6c, C7c, C8c, and C10c are used in the analysis (see Figure 3B), and other carbons
are not considered because of their tentative assignments. Interestingly,
the C1a carbon encounters notable upfield chemical shifts, whereas
other SAIL carbons (considered) show downfield shifts with increasing
[10R5]. The notable increasing upfield shifts of C1a (increased Δδ)
signature localization of 10R5 on the SAIL aggregate near the palisade
surface region (at 200 mM ≈ 5 cmc). Other carbons show weak
downfield shifts and their moderate increase with increasing [10R5]
for gauche-trans conformational changes in the hydrocarbon chains
corroborating with ionic surfactants such as SDS, mixtures of tetradecyl-
and cetyl-trimethylammonium bromide, and so forth.42 Fair downfield changes observed for carbons, in particular,
C4c, C5c, C6c, C2a, C3a, and C10c, indicate penetration of 10R5 up
to these carbons in the SAIL micelle. The present observation is in
line with 13C chemical shifts found in the SDS–triblock
copolymer combination.42,43 Significant downfield shifts
of the anionic methyl carbon (C8a) of the SAIL are taken as disparity
in the chain length between hydrophobic PPO of 10R5 and the SAIL alkyl
chain based on the report in the literature.42,43 The downfield shifts start rising sharply from 10R5 = 60 mM (>cmc)
and maximize at 200 mM. The interaction between SAIL micelles and
starlike tiny premicellar flakes of 10R5 has a say on the shift. The
preferential localization of 10R5 flakes on the SAIL micelle surface
enhances with increasing [10R5].

Microstructures of Formed
Aggregates Assessed by FF-TEM, Cryo-TEM,
NMR, and SANS
In this endeavor, we address the assessment
of microstructures of the formed aggregates of IL/10R5 combinations
in aqueous solution by physical methods, such as TEM, NMR, and SANS
with reference to four ternary mixtures of 10R5/SAIL/D2O: (A) SAIL (20 mM)/10R5 (20 mM)/D2O; (B) SAIL (50 mM)/10R5
(20 mM)/D2O; (C) SAIL (20 mM)/10R5 (200 mM)/D2O; and (D) SAIL (50 mM)/10R5 (200 mM)/D2O. TEM results
are presented in Table 3.

Mixed aggregate sizes obtained from
NMR SD coefficients using TMS
as a solubilizate are also included in Table 3. For the mixture A, nearly spherical aggregates
of radii 40–45 Å are found from FF-TEM measurements (Figure 4A(a)). The morphological
features of mixture B (Figure 4B(a)) are similar to that of mixture A, but quantitatively
their sizes (13–15 Å) are lower than that of mixture A.
Larger spherical aggregates (40–50 Å) are observed in
mixture C (Figure 4C(a)); aggregates of sizes 15–22 Å are witnessed in mixture
D presented in Figure 4D(a). Relatively densely arranged particles are found, which is in
line with the higher viscosity of mixture D. In essence, FF-TEM findings
give direct evidence of the overall formation of spherical aggregates.
Cryo-TEM produces comparable results for all of the mixtures presented
in Figure 4A(b)–D(b);
the values are presented in Table 3. The NMR data for mixtures A and B are of much lower
sizes (∼5 Å) and are presented in Table 3 with reservations. At this juncture, we
cannot rationalize the observation of much lower sizes encountered
in both mixtures A and B until more experiments with close compositions
are at hand. Mixture C exhibited mixed aggregates of large size about
50 Å, and a size dimension of about 26 Å was found for mixture
D (Table 3). The data
of mixtures C and D reasonably agreed with FF-TEM. NMR data for mixtures
C and D reasonably agreed with FF-TEM.

assemblies formed by the interaction in solution are also studied
by SANS. The experimental SANS profiles of the SAIL/10R5 mixtures
A–D are presented in Figure 5, and the results found are shown in Table 3. For mixture A, SANS data lead
to the ellipsoidal shape of the mixed assemblies [axial ratio (a/b) = 2.8] (Table 3). SAIL and 10R5 equally contribute to the
aggregation number (16, comprising 8 molecules from each). Increased
[SAIL] from 20 to 50 mM (mixture B) produces mixed aggregates near
globular with a reduced axial ratio of 2.2 with aggregation number
17, where 12 molecules of IL combine with 5 molecules of 10R5. Increased
[SAIL] enhances its increased population in the aggregates and lowers
the axial ratio. It corroborates with the reported study of the SDS/10R5
system.22 Increased [10R5] to 200 mM in
C and D produces SANS profiles that do not correspond to the aggregate
formation, but to some kind of monomers with Rg (radius of gyration) ≈ 7 Å as if mixtures C and
D do not form self-assemblies. In TEM results (presented above), aggregate
formations are found in all mixtures A to D. This anomaly arises because
the radiation in SANS does not find a contrast with respect to the
solvent. According to reports, PEO alone, as a free chain, and a surfactant
micelle-decorated chain become practically transparent to the neutron
beam.44,45 We find that the 10R5/SAIL ratios in mixtures
A and B are 1 and 0.4, respectively, which in C and D are 10 and 4,
respectively. Lower proportions of 10R5 in A and B make SANS detection
effective which for C and D at higher proportions of the polymer is
ineffective from the standpoint of transparency of the neutron beam
referred to above.44,45 It is obvious that the radiation
responses of both PEO and PPO groups in the mixed conditions with
the SAIL are close.

The microstructures of the aggregates by different methods
are
on the whole not way off. The NMR method has shown limitations in
the size evaluation of mixtures A and B. TEM results are direct and
convincing. The presence of distinct aggregates in the FF-TEM as well
as Cryo-TEM measurements for mixtures C and D supports the limitations
of the SANS method of evaluation discussed above (there, the ellipsoidal
morphology produced by SANS in mixture A is an exception). The above
variations warrant further attention. The proposed microstructures
of the SAIL/10R5 aqueous mixtures are presented in Scheme 1.

Conclusions
Interactions between ILs and pluronics
are being recently studied
for their prospects in the field of materials science. By proper choice,
the produced systems may be made environment-friendly. In the present
study, different physicochemical techniques such as ITC, NMR, SANS,
and Cryo- and FF-TEM are used to probe the aggregation and microstructure
formation of the SAIL (1-butyl-3-methyl imidazolium octylsulfate,
[C4mim] [C8OSO3]) interacted with
the reverse pluronic 10R5 (PO8EO22PO8). ITC, NMR SD, and spin-relaxation point out that the addition of
low concentration, such as 20 mM of 10R5 to 20 mM of SAIL, results
in a synergistic effect forming mixed globular aggregates. Increased
[10R5] from 20 to 50 mM also causes the formation of similar mixed
aggregates. Such aggregate formation arises from preferential localization
of 10R5 in the interfacial region of the SAIL assembly, as found from
the 13C chemical shift analysis. At low [10R5] conditions,
mixed ellipsoidal and globular assemblies are found for mixture A
and mixture B, respectively, with nearly same composition number,
but of different component proportions and sizes as envisaged from
the SANS study. The changes in 2H spin-relaxation difference
(ΔR) suggest nearly spherical, that is, globular
microstructures of the mixed aggregates. Mixtures C and D evidence
nearly spherical aggregates by TEM and NMR methods, whereas aggregate
formation is not found from SANS measurements; the species comprising
the systems are similar to monomers essentially of the larger component
10R5. This is considered as a limitation of the SANS method in the
evaluation of the studied systems. It is found that a proper choice
of 10R5 and SAIL combinations may yield mixed-aggregate morphologies
of desired size and shape. We may herein emphasize that the SAIL behaves
as a surfactant and the pluronic acts like a free or assembled species.
Their interaction leads to the induced small SAIL assembly formation
(as in surfactant–polymer systems) that gets bound with the
10R5 resulting aggregates which are herein attempted to characterize
and report. They are mixed aggregates not mixed micelles as found
in simple mixtures of surfactants. The products have prospects in
the preparation and designing chemically stable nanoobjects, which
may be useful in the formation of fuel cells and nanostructure-based
applications in the fields of material and biomedical sciences. It
is to be noted that the components and, hence, the products of the
herein studied systems fall in the category of green materials.

Materials
and Methods
Materials
The SAIL (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium octylsulfate
[C4mim] [C8OSO3]) and the reverse
pluronic 10R5 that is PO8EO22PO8 (MW
∼2000) were purchased from Aldrich and used as received. Site-specific 2H-labeled SAIL (SAIL-α-d2) was purchased
from CortecNet (France). The chemicals 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate
sodium salt (Z97%), TMS, and deuterium oxide (D2O) (Z99.9 atom % D) were also obtained from
Aldrich and used as NMR reference standards.

Experimental
Methods
Isothermal Titration Calorimetry
For thermometric measurements,
an OMEGA ITC microcalorimeter (MicroCal, USA) was used. A concentrated
solution of the SAIL (325 μL in a microsyringe) was injected
into 1.325 mL of the solvent in the calorimetric cell at equal time
intervals (210 s) in multiple steps (32–50 additions) under
constant stirring (350 rpm) condition. All measurements were taken
at a constant temperature condition maintained by a Neslab RTE 100
circulating water bath. The heat released or absorbed at each step
of dilution of surfactant solution in either water or polymer solution
was recorded, and the enthalpy change per mole of injectant was calculated
by ITC MicroCal Origin 2.9 software. The reproducibility was checked
from repeated experimentations. The procedures for the evaluation
of the cmc and enthalpy of micellization (ΔHm°) were
reported earlier.18,29 Enthalpy profiles of the SAIL
at [10R5] = 0, 20, 50, and 100 mM were determined and presented for
analysis. The measurement temperature was 303 ± 0.1 K.

Nuclear
Magnetic Resonance
NMR measurements were taken
at 298 K using a JEOL FT-NMR (ECA-500) spectrometer operating at 500
MHz. 1H and 13C chemical shifts (δ), 1H spin–lattice relaxation rates (R1), and 1H SD coefficients (D) were measured for SAIL/10R5/D2O and SAIL/D2O mixtures as a function of [SAIL]. For 1H NMR-based experiments
(R1 and D), the concentrations
of 10R5 were fixed, whereas IL was varied. For 13C chemical
shift measurements, [IL] was chosen as 200 mM in view of micellized
IL (five times cmc) as well as for sensitivity considerations. For 2H NMR R1 and R2, [IL] and [10R5] used were commensurate with that of
R1 and D. TMS was used as a probe to infer intradiffusion
coefficients36 for the specific compositions
of SAIL and 10R5, namely, SAIL (200 mM)/D2O (mixture I),
SAIL (200 mM)/10R5 (20 mM)/D2O (mixture II), and SAIL (200
mM)/10R5 (50 mM)/D2O (mixture III). 2H spin–lattice
relaxation rates (R1) and 2H spin–spin relaxation times (R2) were also taken for the ternary mixtures of SAIL-α-d2/10R5/H2O as a function of both [IL] and [10R5]
for limited compositions. The anionic α-CH2/α-CD2 signal of SAIL/SAIL-d2 was used in the diffusion
and spin-relaxation analysis.

1H and 13C NMR Chemical Shifts
The 1H and 13C chemical shift data for SAIL
(200 mM)/10R5/D2O as a function of [10R5] were recorded
(at 298 K) with a view to addressing the preferential location of
10R5 in the SAIL micelle. 1H and 13C chemical
shifts referencing procedures were provided in earlier reports.43,46

1H Translational SD
For 1H translational
SD measurements, the bipolar pulse pair longitudinal encode–decode
(BPPLED) sequence47 was employed and the
experimental and processing details were as described elsewhere.48 The diffusion coefficients were obtained by
linear fitting of the experimental data to the Stejskal–Tanner49 equation, I = Iο e–kD, where I and Iο are the peak
intensities in the presence and absence of gradient pulses; the parameter k = (γnΩg)2(Δ – Ω/3), γn is the magnetogyric ratio, g is the gradient amplitude, whereas gradient duration (Ω) and
diffusion time (Δ) are 6 and 200 ms, respectively, and D is the translational SD coefficient.49 A single exponential nature of the magnetization recovery
was observed from the plots of intensity versus g2. The estimated error in D was <±2%.

In micellar systems, experimental
NMR parameters such as chemical shift (δ), spin–spin
lattice relaxation rate (R2), spin–lattice
relaxation rate (R1), and translational
SD coefficient (D) are considered as weighted averages
over the NMR time scales because of the fast exchange of surfactant
molecules between monomer and micelles.31 Hence, the observed D is given by31 1  where Df and Db represent free (monomer)
and bound (micelle)
diffusion coefficients, respectively. Here, pf and pb are the free and bound
fraction of surfactant, respectively, so that pf + pb = 1.

We then get 1a  

The measured Db enables to calculate
the hydrodynamic radius (RH) of micelle/aggregate
with the aid of Stokes–Einstein relation31 2  where all the other symbols have their usual
meaning.

2H Spin-Relaxation (R1 and R2)
2H R1 and R2 measurements
were made using inversion recovery and Carr–Purcell–Meiboom–Gill
pulse sequences, respectively.50 Magnetization
recovery profiles for both R1 and R2 data manifest exponential decays; the corresponding
data analyses corroborate three and two parameter fits, respectively.
The estimated errors in both R1 and R2 data were <±2%.

Small-Angle
Neutron Scattering
SANS measurements were
taken using neutron scattering facility at DHRUVA reactor, Trombay,
India. SANS profiles were monitored for SAIL/10R5/D2O mixtures
as a function of concentration. D2O was used as a solvent
instead of H2O as the former is devoid of incoherent background
and subsequently improved the contrast in SANS experiments. The wavelength
of the incident SANS beam utilized was 5.2 Å with Δλ/λ
= 15%. The scattering intensity profiles were monitored in the scattering
vector (Q) range of 0.015–0.35 Å–1. The standard protocol details pertaining to the
background corrections, empty cell contributions, transmission, and
so forth were mentioned in our earlier reports.28,51

The SANS experiment probes the differential scattering cross
section (dΣ/dΩ) per unit volume against Q and is presented as52 3  where n signifies the number
density of the micelles, ρm and ρs are the scattering length densities of the micelle and the solvent,
respectively, and Vm is the volume of
the micelle. P(Q) and S(Q) are the intraparticle and interparticle structure
factors, sensitive to the shape and size of micelles and micelle–micelle
interactions, respectively. The constant B reflects the background
effects in a typical SANS experiment. In the present SANS analysis, P(Q) has been calculated using ellipsoidal
micelles51 and S(Q) by the method of Hayter and Penfold for the screened
Coulomb interaction between the charged micelles.28,53 The composition of mixed micelle (volume and scattering length density)
having x1 and x2 mole fractions of surfactant and polymer considering the ideal mixing
of the components, respectively, is taken as53 4   5  where N1 and N2 characterize
aggregation numbers, ν1 and ν2 are
the monomer volumes, and ρ1 and ρ2 indicate the scattering length densities
of surfactant and polymer, respectively. The values of ν1 for the surfactant and ν2 for PPO tails
of the polymer are taken to be 578.6 and 1544.0 Å3, respectively. The scattering from the PEO part of the polymer is
neglected because of its poor contrast. The corresponding ρ1 and ρ2 values used are 0.48 × 1010 and 0.34 × 1010 cm–2,
respectively. The scattering length density for D2O is
6.38 × 1010 cm–2. The total aggregation
number of the mixed micelle is represented by N (=N1 + N2) and calculated
by dividing the volume of mixed micelle by Vm, whereas N1 and N2 are then determined as Nx1 and Nx2, respectively.

The findings
were subjected to the nonlinear least-squares fitting
of the model scattering and the experimental data. Background corrections
were also applied for instrumental smearing during the data analysis.
The fitted data were revealed by the solid lines to the experimental
data points. The scattering contribution from the hydrophobic core
region of the micelle was considered in the SANS data analysis, whereas
scattering from corona (hydrated shell) was not taken into account
because most of the scattering originated from the core.

Cryo-/Freeze-Fracture
Transmission Electron Microscopy
TEM observations of the
sample were recorded using the freeze-replica
method. The sample was rapidly frozen in liquid propane with a Cryo-preparation
system (LEICA EM CPC, LEICA microsystems), and the frozen sample was
transferred into a freeze-replica preparing apparatus (FR-7000A, Hitachi
Science Systems) and fractured with a glass knife at 153 K. A replica
film was prepared by evaporating platinum carbon at 318 K and then
carbon at 363 K on the fractured sample.54 The replica film prepared was washed several times with acetone
and distilled water after being taken out of the freeze-replica preparing
apparatus and transferred onto a 300 mesh copper grid. The replica
thus prepared was examined with a transmission electron microscope
(JEM-1200EX, JEOL).
