Polyaniline
(PANI) and 2,5-dianilino-p-benzoquinone
both are formed by oxidation of aniline in an acidic aqueous environment.
The aim of this study is to understand the impact of addition of p-benzoquinone on the structure of PANI prepared by the
oxidation of aniline hydrochloride with ammonium peroxydisulfate and
to elucidate the formation of low-molecular-weight byproducts. An
increasing yield and size-exclusion chromatography, Fourier-transform
infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and
nuclear magnetic resonance analyses of the products show that p-benzoquinone does not act as a terminating agent in the
synthesis of PANI and the content of 2,5-dianilino-p-benzoquinone increases with the increasing molar concentration of p-benzoquinone in the reaction mixture, [BzQ]. Regarding
the structure of PANI, Raman and UV–visible spectra show that
the doping level and the charge delocalization both decrease with
the increase of [BzQ], and the FTIR spectra of the PANI bases indicate
an increased concentration of benzenoid units at higher [BzQ]. We
explain these observations by an increasing concentration of structural
defects in PANI chains and propose a 2,5-dianilino-p-benzoquinone-like structure of these defects present as pendant
groups. The bands typical of 2,5-dianilino-p-benzoquinone-like
moiety are observed even in the vibrational spectra of the sample
prepared without addition of p-benzoquinone. This
confirms in situ oxidation of aniline to p-benzoquinone
within the course of the oxidation of aniline hydrochloride to PANI.

Introduction
Polyaniline (PANI),1−3 one of the most extensively studied conducting polymers,
is usually prepared by the oxidation of aniline with ammonium peroxydisulfate
(APS).4 Oxidation of aniline hydrochloride
in aqueous medium leads to a conducting PANI emeraldine salt (conductivity
σ ≈ 100 S cm–1; Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Oxidation of Aniline
Hydrochloride with APS Leads to PANI Emeraldine
Salt
Regarding the reaction course,
oxidation of aniline with APS in
acidic aqueous media is not a step-growth polymerization because it
is assumed that recombination of the radical cations of aniline n-mers with each other is virtually impossible, as they
are insoluble in the reaction system and form a new phase.2,5 However, this reaction is not a typical chain-growth polymerization
consisting of initiation, propagation, and termination reactions as
well. The oxidation of aniline with APS in acidic aqueous media can
be monitored by the pH–time, temperature–time, and open-circuit-potential–time
profiles of the reaction course.2,6,7 The in situ measurements provide information that the oxidative
polymerization of aniline with APS in the acidic aqueous media typically
consists of an initiation reaction, an induction period, and a polymerization
phase.2,3 The process of aniline oxidation is exothermic
and results in a continuous increase of the acidity of the reaction
medium.2,6 Even though a PANI in emeraldine oxidation
state is formed by this reaction at the APS-to-aniline mole ratio
of 1.25, a higher PANI oxidation state called pernigraniline is formed
as an intermediate within the reaction course.3,5,7 Information on the kinetic description of
the oxidative polymerization of aniline is limited in the literature,
as the reaction is heterogeneous and a self-acceleration effect takes
place during the polymerization phase.5,8

Various
mechanisms of the oxidative polymerization of aniline with
APS in the acidic aqueous media were proposed in the literature (for
review, see refs3,5); from these suggestions, the mechanism proposed by Gospodinova
and Terlemezyan1 with a certain correction
fits best the experimental observations: in the first reaction stage,
peroxydisulfate anions oxidize neutral aniline molecules which are
in equilibria with anilinium cations. The anilinium cation radicals
form dimers which are further oxidized by peroxydisulfate anions to
dimer cation radicals which react with the anilinium cation radicals
and form trimers which are often reported to be of a phenazine-like
structure. In the later stage, peroxydisulfate anions oxidize growing
PANI chains to the pernigraniline oxidation state and anilinium cations
are oxidized by protonated diamino quinonoid units of pernigraniline
to the anilinium cation radicals which are connected to the growing
PANI chains, that is, the oxidant oxidizes the growing polymer and
the molecules of the monomer are oxidized by the polymer.3,5 The information on the termination of PANI chain growth is limited.
It has been suggested that the hydrolysis of the terminal amino group
in a growing PANI chain to a quinone prevents further addition of
aniline because of which the chain growth terminates.9−11 The chain growth can simply stop also because of the depletion of
the oxidant, peroxydisulfate. In such case, termination need not occur
and the chain propagation is claimed to be recovered after addition
of a new portion of the oxidant, that is, the chains were proposed
to be quasi-living.12

Chemical oxidation
of aniline to p-benzoquinone
is an alternative reaction5,6,9,13 (Scheme 2) to the oxidative polymerization of aniline,
which was used even in the industrial production of p-benzoquinone. According to the electrochemical studies of aniline
oxidation, it is expected that p-benzoquinone is
a product of hydrolysis of an oxidized aniline dimer, N-phenyl-1,4-benzoquinonediimine.9,14−19 Further, p-benzoquinone smoothly reacts with aniline
to form 2,5-dianilino-p-benzoquinone (Scheme 3),13,20,21 and the reaction of p-benzoquinone
with p-phenylenediamine leads similarly to the formation
of 2,5-di(4-aminophenylamino)-p-benzoquinone.22,23 It has been recently reported that the 2,5-dianilino-p-benzoquinone-like oligomers are generated by the oxidation of aniline
with weaker oxidants, such as silver nitrate and iron(III)chloride,
in aqueous solutions of methanesulfonic acid to which no p-benzoquinone was added.24

Scheme 2 Oxidation
of Aniline to p-Benzoquinone
Scheme 3 Reaction of Aniline with p-Benzoquinone Leads
to
2,5-Dianilino-p-benzoquinone
It is known that the properties of PANI prepared with
APS slightly
vary depending on the experimentalist who has prepared it,4 and there is no relevant explanation in the literature
for reported differences in electric properties and spectroscopic
characteristics. As p-benzoquinone is a product of
the oxidation of aniline by a strong oxidant in an acidic medium and
the oxidative polymerization of aniline with APS proceeds through
a range of pH and oxidation potential values, the in situ formation
of p-benzoquinone in the course of PANI synthesis
can be hardly excluded. As a result, the in situ-formed p-benzoquinone can play various roles in the oxidation of aniline
with APS. By considering the above chemistry, we can expect the following
scenarios:(1) p-Benzoquinone reacts
with aniline (Scheme 3) and produces 2,5-dianilino-p-benzoquinone as a
byproduct without affecting the growth of PANI chains.

(2) The growing PANI chains react with p-benzoquinone produced by the oxidation of aniline (Scheme 2) similarly to the
reaction of aniline with p-benzoquinone (Scheme 3). Up to two PANI
chains could be attached to a single p-benzoquinone
molecule. This should result in the termination of the growth of PANI
chains and thus in the narrowing of distribution of the molecular-weight
values of the formed PANI chains, which might theoretically imply
better solubility and processibility of PANI.

(3) p-Benzoquinone is
incorporated into a growing PANI chain as a comonomer without causing
the chain termination.



In order to distinguish
among the possible roles of p-benzoquinone in PANI
synthesis, we have carried out the “standard”
preparation of PANI4 when 0.2 M aniline
hydrochloride is oxidized with 0.25 M APS without the addition of p-benzoquinone and in the presence of p-benzoquinone in the concentrations varying from 0.001 to 0.2 M.
The impact of p-benzoquinone on the formation and
structure of PANI is elucidated, and the formation of 2,5-dianilino-p-benzoquinone-like oligomers is investigated by means of
various spectroscopic methods and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC).

Results
and Discussion
Yields, Molecular-Weight Distributions, and
Conductivity
The reactions of 0.2 M aniline hydrochloride
with APS yielded dark
solids within the whole range of applied concentrations of p-benzoquinone, [BzQ], which varied from 0 to 0.2 M. The
yield of PANI prepared without addition of p-benzoquinone
equal to 0.81 g of PANI hydrochloride per 1 g of aniline hydrochloride
is close to the theoretical value, which is 0.84 g of PANI hydrochloride
per 1 g of aniline hydrochloride. The yield of the products prepared
in the presence of p-benzoquinone increased with
the increase of [BzQ] (see Table 1). These yields exceeded the theoretical value for
PANI synthesis (Scheme 1) for [BzQ] ≥ 0.05 M. This means that p-benzoquinone
is incorporated into the products.

Loss of mass
after deprotonation (Table 1) is similar for all samples; the observed
values within the range 18–21% slightly exceed the theoretical
loss of mass for the deprotonation of PANI hydrochloride to PANI base,
which is equal to 17%.

Molecular-weight distributions obtained
by SEC (Figure 1) reveal
the formation of polymeric
fractions for the whole range of applied [BzQ]. Polymeric fractions
exhibit weight-average molecular weights, Mw, between 15 000 and 23 000 (Table 1) and dispersity, D̵, between 3 and 4 (Table 1) for all samples. These results clearly prove that p-benzoquinone does not act as a terminating agent in the
growth of PANI chains. Furthermore, samples prepared with [BzQ] ≥
0.05 M exhibit the presence of low-molecular-weight fraction (Figure 1) with Mw ≈ 200. Position of the peak of the low-molecular-weight
fraction corresponded well with the position of the peak of neat 2,5-dianilino-p-benzoquinone (Figure 1).

The traces are vertically shifted for clarity. Weight-average molecular
weights, Mw, and dispersity, D̵ = Mw/Mn,
are given in Table 1.

Conductivities of the as-prepared
samples are of the order of 100 S cm–1 (Table 1 and Figure 2A), which is typical
of a PANI salt prepared by the
“standard” procedure, that is, by the oxidation of 0.2
M aniline hydrochloride with 0.25 M APS in an aqueous environment.4 No trend in conductivities is observed; they
vary within a range of conductivities typical of “standard”
PANI synthesis done by different experimentalists.4 This is in contrast with the addition of various amounts
of hydroquinone to the reaction mixtures, which resulted in a decrease
in conductivity with an increasing amount of hydroquinone.25 The conductivities of PANI bases are of the
order 10–10–10–9 S cm–1 independent of the voltage used in a two-point method
(Figure 2A); a monotonous
increase in conductivity is observed with the increase of [BzQ]. Besides
higher conductivity, another interesting effect was observed for increasing
[BzQ]: feasibility to measure the conductivity of bases with the van
der Pauw method, which is usually not the case for “standard”
PANI bases. We speculate that this might be connected with the presence
of a low-molecular-weight component (Figure 1A), and it is further discussed in the section Structure of Low-Molecular-Weight Byproducts and Nature
of Defects in PANI Chains (see below). A good agreement between
the values obtained by the two-probe method and the van der Pauw method
indicates low anisotropy in the conductivity of the pellets prepared
by pressing these PANI bases.

concentrations of p-benzoquinone (A) and temperature
dependence of conductivity with corresponding theoretical fits for
selected salts (B).

Temperature dependence
of conductivity of samples prepared with
high [BzQ] mimics the one for the “standard” PANI (Figure 2B). For evaluation,
we followed the approach from ref (26) for composite models because the fit of a single
model was not able to cover the whole temperature range successfully.
Regarding fitting results, we chose eq 1 as the most appropriate function to fit data. 1  

This model assumes the existence of two major contributions
to
overall conductivity, one is of hopping type27,28 and the other is of a more general type following a simple Arrhenius-like
model. The adjustable parameters (Table 2) of the model are very similar for all measured
samples; hence, increase of [BzQ] does not affect much the transport-related
parameters, such as doping level and disorder.

UV–Visible Spectra
The UV–visible spectra
of the protonated forms of the samples (recorded for solution in NMP
containing 0.5 vol % of hydrochloric acid) prepared with [BzQ] varying
from 0.001 to 0.2 M (Figure 3A) are of the character typical of the spectrum of the PANI
salt prepared without addition of p-benzoquinone
(presented in Figure 3A as well). The spectrum of PANI salt consists of the bands at 330
and 428 nm and of the band with a maximum in the near-infrared region.
The band at 330 nm corresponds to the π–π* transitions
in benzenoid units, whereas the bands at 428 nm and in the near-infrared
region are attributed to polaronic transitions.29−31 The spectrum
of neat 2,5-dianilino-p-benzoquinone recorded under
the same conditions is presented in Figure 3A for comparison.

Figure 3 UV–visible spectra

aniline hydrochloride with 0.25 M APS under concentrations of p-benzoquinone varying from 0 to 0.2 M and of 2,5-dianilino-p-benzoquinone. (A) Spectra of the protonated forms (spectra
recorded for solutions of the samples in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone
containing 0.5 vol % of hydrochloric acid). (B) Spectra of the bases
(samples dissolved in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone containing
0.5 vol % of triethanolamine). Spectra were normalized to the absorption
maximum at ≈330 nm.

The spectrum of neat 2,5-dianilino-p-benzoquinone
(Figure 3A) consists
of the absorption band at 270 nm and the absorption band at 380 nm
accompanied by a weak absorption tail in the region from 470 to 620
nm. To assign the absorption bands of 2,5-dianilino-p-benzoquinone, we have performed density functional theory (DFT)
calculations, which have shown that the most stable structure of 2,5-dianilino-p-benzoquinone is stabilized by the intramolecular hydrogen
bonding N–H···O=C (Figure 4A). According to the time-dependent (TD-)DFT
calculations, the electronic transition between the molecular orbital
energetically below the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO-1)
and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) contributes dominantly
the main absorption band, which is experimentally observed at 380
nm (Figure 3A) and
which occurs at 350 nm in the calculated spectrum (Figure 4B). While the molecular orbital
HOMO-1 is delocalized over the whole 2,5-dianilino-p-benzoquinone molecule (Figure 4B), the LUMO is mainly localized on the 2,5-diamino-p-benzoquinone moiety (Figure 4B). The band at 270 nm can be assigned to
the π–π* transitions in the phenyl rings of 2,5-dianilino-p-benzoquinone.25 However, TD-DFT
calculations have shown that it is contributed by several transitions
between orbitals, which are not localized only on the phenyl rings
of 2,5-dianilino-p-benzoquinone.

Inspection of the spectra of the protonated forms of PANI
samples
(Figure 3A) demonstrate
that the increase of [BzQ] in the reaction mixtures is reflected by
the following features: (1) intensities of the bands connected with
polaronic transitions decrease, (2) the band at 330 nm shifts to higher
wavelengths, and (3) the intensity of the band at 270 nm increases
with the increase of [BzQ]. These changes can be explained by two
parallel processes: the concentration of polarons or the extent of
polaron delocalization in PANI chains decreases with the increase
of [BzQ] and the content of low-molecular-weight byproducts increases
with the increase of [BzQ].

UV–visible spectra of the
bases (Figure 3B) display
bands at 334 and 630 nm, which
are typical of a PANI emeraldine base. The band at 334 nm is connected
with π–π* transitions in benzenoid units and the
band at 630 nm with exciton-like transitions in quinone diimino units.32,33 The comparison of intensities of these bands shows that the intensity
of the band at 630 nm decreases with the increase of [BzQ]. This is
connected with a shift of the maximum of the band belonging to the
transitions within benzenoid units from 334 nm to the longer wavelengths.
In the spectra of the samples prepared with [BzQ] ≥ 0.05 M,
the band at 630 nm is practically suppressed and the band belonging
to the π–π* transitions in benzenoid units is shifted
to 342 nm (Figure 3B). The observed differences in spectra are in agreement with changes
in the intensities of the bands observed for reduction of PANI emeraldine
base to its leucoemeraldine form in NMP solution32 and indicate a decreased content of diamino quinonoid units
in PANI bases. A comparable decreased content of nonprotonated diamino
quinonoid units has been observed for partially self-doped PANI bases.31,34 However, the differences in the spectra of PANI bases (Figure 3B) are most probably
partially due to the increasing fraction of 2,5-dianilino-p-benzoquinone in the products; the spectrum of 2,5-dianilino-p-benzoquinone recorded under the same conditions is presented
in Figure 3B for comparison.

FTIR Spectra
The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
spectroscopy is a bulk method that provides information on a composition
of whole samples. The FTIR spectra of the as-prepared samples (Figure 5A) indicate the formation
of PANI salt35 within the whole range of
applied [BzQ]. Additional bands/shoulders at 1444 and 692 cm–1 are resolved in the spectra of the samples prepared with [BzQ] ≥
0.02 M. The detail investigation of the spectra shows that the band
connected with quinonoid units changes its character with the increase
of [BzQ]: a flat maximum between 1577 and 1560 cm–1 is observed for the quinonoid ring-stretching vibrations of the
“standard” PANI salt,35 and
a sharp maximum at 1564 cm–1 is observed in the
spectrum of the sample prepared at [BzQ] = 0.2 M. The latter one corresponds
to the position in the spectrum of 2,5-dianilino-p-benzoquinone (presented in Figure 5B). Other vibrations of 2,5-dianilino-p-benzoquinone were found in the spectrum of the sample prepared at
[BzQ] = 0.2 M as very weak bands.

of 0.2 M aniline hydrochloride
with 0.25 M APS under concentrations of p-benzoquinone

and (B) spectra of the ammonia-treated samples (bases) with the spectrum
of 2,5-dianilino-p-benzoquinone shown for comparison.

The FTIR spectra of the bases
(Figure 5B) also exhibit
bands typical of the “standard”
PANI base.35 However, a set of additional
bands is clearly resolved in the spectra of the samples prepared with
[BzQ] ≥ 0.01 M. These additional bands are observed at 3236
(for full-range spectra, see Figure S1B in the Supporting Information), 1637, 1569, 1444, 1290, and 1146
cm–1 and their intensities increase with the increase
of [BzQ] (Figure 5B).
The bands at 3236, 1637, 1569, 1444, and 1290 cm–1 are at the positions of the bands in the spectrum of 2,5-dianilino-p-benzoquinone, which is presented in Figure 4B for comparison. In the spectrum of 2,5-dianilino-p-benzoquinone, we assign the band at 3236 cm–1 to the N–H stretching vibration [ν(N–H)], the
band at 1637 cm–1 to the C=O stretching vibration
[ν(C=O)], the band at 1569 cm–1 to
the quinonoid ring-stretching vibration, the bands at 1505 and 1491
cm–1 to the benzenoid ring-stretching vibrations,
the band at 1444 cm–1 to the C=C stretching
of aromatic ring, and the band at 1290 cm–1 to the
C–N stretching vibration [ν(C–N)].35 The last additional band at 1146 cm–1 resolved in the spectra of PANI bases prepared with [BzQ] ≥
0.01 M is not observed in the spectrum of 2,5-dianilino-p-benzoquinone. We assign the band at 1146 cm–1 to
the mode of B–NH–B (B stands for benzenoid rings) and/or
to the C–H in-plane deformation vibrations in the benzenoid
rings [δ(C–H)] of PANI base chains.35 The occurrence of this band and the increase in its intensity
with the increase of [BzQ] indicates the reduced oxidation state of
PANI chains. This is consistent with the observation in the UV–visible
spectra of PANI bases (see above).

Spectra of solids obtained
by evaporation of the ammonia solutions
collected after deprotonation of PANI salts (Figure S1C in the Supporting Information) have shown that all the
samples were doped by hydrochloric acid and no dependence on [BzQ]
is observed.

Raman Spectra
The as-prepared samples
were also studied
by Raman microspectroscopy. From the view of this method with a spot
diameter of few microns, the samples were found to be inhomogeneous.
Most of the material consisted of PANI (Figure 6A), but it was possible to find areas where
additional bands were clearly resolved in the spectra (Figure 6B).

Figure 6 Raman spectra of the
products of the oxidation of 0.2 M aniline
hydrochloride with 0.25 M APS under concentrations of p-benzoquinone varying from 0 to 0.2 M. (A) Spectra recorded with
excitation wavelengths 633 nm in sample areas, where spectra corresponded
to PANI salt, and (B) spectra recorded with excitation wavelengths
785 nm in sample areas, where additional bands were observed.

The
Raman spectra of the as-prepared samples excited with the 633
nm laser line display well the level of PANI doping, as nondoped quinonoid
sites are resonantly enhanced. In the spectra of the PANI areas (Figure 6A), the intensity
of the C∼N+• stretching
band at 1336 cm–1 in the delocalized
polaron structure36−38 (~ denotes a bond intermediate between a single and
a double bond) decreases with the increase of [BzQ]. Simultaneously,
the band connected with C=N stretching vibrations in a nondoped
quinonoid structure38−40 at 1468 cm–1 increases and the
ratio of the C–N stretching vibration bands36,38,41 at 1221 and 1257 cm–1 changes
in favor of nondoped quinonoid structures. These observations suggest
a gradual change in the structure of formed PANI samples; the doping
level of PANI salts as well as the charge delocalization in PANI salts
decreases with the increase of [BzQ]. This observation is in agreement
with the trends in the UV–visible spectra of protonated forms
(Figure 3A), indicating
a decreasing concentration of polarons and/or extent of polaron delocalization.

Spectra with the additional Raman bands at 435, 575, and 1650 cm–1 were observed with the 785 nm excitation line (Figure 6B) at some spots
of most of the samples including PANI prepared in the absence of p-benzoquinone. The Raman band at 435 cm–1 corresponds to the ring deformation vibration of the benzoquinone
ring,42−45 the band at 575 cm–1 to the deformation vibration
of a benzenoid ring bonded to a benzoquinone ring,43 and the band at 1650 cm–1 to the C=O
stretching vibration.42 The intensities
of these bands are not correlated with [BzQ]; they depend rather on
the specific spot chosen for measurement. We can only speculate that
this is caused by an inhomogeneous distribution of p-benzoquinone in the environment of growing PANI chains. As areas
with the bands indicating the presence of p-benzoquinone
and benzenoid rings attached to p-benzoquinone were
observed even for PANI prepared without addition of p-benzoquinone, we confirm that p-benzoquinone forms
in situ during the “standard” synthesis of PANI from
0.2 M aniline hydrochloride and 0.25 M APS in an aqueous environment.

XPS Spectra
High-resolution core-level N 1s X-ray photoelectron
(XPS) spectra of the bases and of 2,5-dianilino-p-benzoquinone (Figure 7) show different contents of nitrogen atoms in secondary amine −NH–
and imine =N– configurations
in the studied samples. In the N 1s XPS spectrum of the “standard”
PANI base (Figure 7), the band related to −NH– is observed at 399.0 eV
and the band of =N– is observed at 397.9 eV.46 Approximately 30% of nitrogen atoms were detected
in the =N– configuration
in the spectrum of the “standard” PANI base (Figure 7). Comparable values
between 29 and 32% are observed for [BzQ] increasing from 0.001 to
0.02 M. The situation is different for the samples prepared with [BzQ]
= 0.05–0.2 M. These samples exhibit lower intensity of the
band of the =N– nitrogens; the observed molar content
of the =N– nitrogens is within the range of 24–21%
and its value decreases with the increase of [BzQ]. This can be explained
by a higher content of 2,5-dianilino-p-benzoquinone,
which does not have the band of the =N– nitrogens (Figure 7). A higher content
of 2,5-dianilino-p-benzoquinone in these samples
is expected because of the overstoichiometric yields (Table 1). Moreover, a decreased content
of the =N– nitrogens in these samples can also be expected
in the structure of these PANI bases, as a lower content of diamino
quinonoid units has been observed by UV–visible spectroscopy
(Figure 3B).

Solid-State Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectra
The
comparison of solid-state 13C cross-polarization (CP)/magic
angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of the
bases and of 2,5-dianilino-p-benzoquinone (Figure 8) clearly reflects
that the spectral pattern gradually differs depending on [BzQ] in
the reaction mixtures. In the absence of p-benzoquinone,
the signals resonating in the frequency region from ca. 160 to 100
ppm clearly reflect the formation of the “standard”
PANI base.47−49 A highly amorphous and disordered character of the
formed PANI chains is expected because of the observed broadening
of the detected 13C CP/MAS NMR signals.

oxidation products of 0.2 M aniline hydrochloride with 0.25 M APS
under concentrations of p-benzoquinone varying from
0 to 0.2 M and of 2,5-dianilino-p-benzoquinone (prepared
according to ref (24)). The chemical structure of PANI base and 2,5-dianilino-p-benzoquinone with chemical shift assignments.

For [BzQ] varying from 0 to 0.01 M, there are no
apparent changes
in the spectral pattern of the synthesized PANI bases except of the
observation of a weak and relatively broad signal at ca. 95 ppm. This
signal is at the position of the signal of carbon atom C7 of 2,5-dianilino-p-benzoquinone (see atom assignment in Figure 8) according to the comparison
with the 13C CP/MAS NMR spectrum of this compound (Figure 8, bottom spectrum).
The observed broadening of the recorded signal then suggests rather
incorporation of 2,5-dianilino-p-benzoquinone into
PANI chains than some kind of interactions between 2,5-dianilino-p-benzoquinone and PANI chains. In the latter case, we would
expect a narrow signal which would be due to the interaction shifted
from the position observed for the neat 2,5-dianilino-p-benzoquinone. However, this signal at ca. 95 ppm becomes narrow
for [BzQ] ≥ 0.05 M and a secondary set of narrow signals is
superimposed on the broad signals of the PANI base. These narrow and
well-separated signals resonating at 179.9, 146.2, 127.9, and 95.3
ppm clearly reflect the formation of 2,5-dianilino-p-benzoquinone, which is in agreement with the results of FTIR spectroscopy.
The two-component character of the detected 13C CP/MAS
NMR spectra for [BzQ] = 0.05–0.2 M indicates weak interactions
between 2,5-dianilino-p-benzoquinone and the PANI
matrix. This finding rather suggests the formation of nano-/micro-segregated
domains of 2,5-dianilino-p-benzoquinone dispersed
in the PANI matrix, which is in an agreement with the inhomogeneity
of the samples observed by Raman microspectroscopy.

Structure of
Low-Molecular-Weight Byproduct and Nature of Defects
in PANI Chains
The results described and discussed above
have shown that the reaction of aniline hydrochloride with APS in
an aqueous environment under various [BzQ] results in the formation
of PANI, whose molecular structure gradually changes with the increase
of [BzQ], and under [BzQ] ≥ 0.05 M also results in the formation
of a low-molecular-weight byproduct.

The low-molecular-weight
byproduct is formed for aniline oxidation carried out with [BzQ] ≥
0.05 M (see SEC elution curves in Figure 1). The positions of peaks of the low-molecular-weight
fraction in SEC chromatograms correspond well with the position of
the peak of neat, commercially obtained 2,5-dianilino-p-benzoquinone (Figure 1). Both FTIR and solid-state 13C CP/MAS NMR spectra of
the PANI bases prepared with [BzQ] ≥ 0.05 M (Figures 5B and 8) exhibit the occurrence of additional bands at the positions corresponding
to the positions of the bands of neat 2,5-dianilino-p-benzoquinone. Further, the yields of the products of reactions carried
out with [BzQ] ≥ 0.05 M (Table 1) exceed the theoretical value for oxidation of aniline
hydrochloride to PANI hydrochloride. According to all these facts,
we conclude that the low-molecular-weight byproduct is 2,5-dianilino-p-benzoquinone. This is in concord with the fact that the
reaction of aniline with p-benzoquinone in the absence
of APS provides 2,5-dianilino-p-benzoquinone13 and with the fact that oxidation of aniline
with weaker oxidants provides under certain conditions 2,5-dianilino-p-benzoquinone instead of PANI,24 which is due to the in situ oxidation of aniline to p-benzoquinone.

Regarding the structure of PANI, the SEC analysis
has shown that
the weight-average molecular weights of PANI samples are between 15 000
and 23 000 within the whole range of [BzQ]. According to this,
we clearly conclude that p-benzoquinone does not
act as a terminating agent in the growth of PANI chains. Employed
spectroscopic methods show differences in the structure of PANI samples
prepared under various [BzQ]. The observed differences in the spectra
are more or less proportional to [BzQ], and we thus presume formation
of structure defects in PANI chains, the concentration of which depends
on [BzQ]. Both UV–visible and XPS spectra (Figures 3B and 7) show a decreased content of diamino quinonoid units in PANI bases
prepared with higher [BzQ]. Even though this is partially caused by
a superposition with the spectrum of the low-molecular-weight byproduct,
it is consistent with the information on increased concentrations
of benzenoid units in these samples, which is deduced from the occurrence
of the band at 1146 cm–1 in the FTIR spectra of
PANI bases (Figure 5B). Raman spectroscopy and UV–visible spectroscopy of the
PANI salts then provide information on the decreased concentration
of polarons and/or the lower extent of polaron delocalization. This
is not in contradiction with previous data; as the number of available
diamino quinonoid units in PANI chains decreases, the extent of their
protonation decreases as well. We speculate that protonation of diamino
quinonoid units in PANI chains with structure defects is less thermodynamically
favored in comparison to their protonation in an ideal PANI chain.
In the previous point, we expect that the formation of diamino quinonoid
units is possible in PANI chains with a certain distance between structure
defects only.31,34,50 If the distance between the structure defects decreases, the formation
of diamino quinonoid units in PANI chains is most probably less thermodynamically
favored. Because of this, the decrease of concentration of diamino
quinonoid units in PANI chains is connected with the increase of concentration
of benzenoid units. According to this, we expect that the structure
of PANI samples prepared at higher [BzQ] is disturbed by structure
defects.

A reaction comparable to the reaction of primary amine
with p-benzoquinone (Scheme 3) can be suggested for p-benzoquinone
and two PANI chains (Scheme 4). Such cross-linking of PANI chains would probably only slightly
affect the conductivity of PANI and would lower the extent of polaron
delocalization observed in Raman spectra. Both expectations are in
agreement with experimental data. However, an increase in molecular-weight
values with the increase of [BzQ] would be expected or maybe an insoluble
PANI network would be obtained. Our experimental data do not meet
these expectations, and thus, we do not expect cross-linking of PANI
chains by 2,5-di(diphenylamino)-p-benzoquinone moieties
to be the nature of structure defects in the studied polymers. Furthermore,
exposure of “standard” PANI base ([−NH−]
+ [=N−] = 0.2 M) to p-benzoquinone
([BzQ] = 0.2 M) in hydrochloric acid ([HCl] = 0.2 M) for 48 hours
resulted in formation of a PANI salt which did not exhibit any additional
bands in the FTIR spectra.

Scheme 4 Considered Structure Defects Formed by a
Reaction of p-Benzoquinone with Two PANI Chains Resulting
in Moieties Similar
to 2,5-Dianilino-p-benzoquinone
Hydrogen bonding between the hydrogen of PANI
amino group and the
carbonyl group of 2,5-dianilino-p-benzoquinone (Scheme 5) might theoretically
lower the electron density in PANI chains, which could be reflected
as a reduced oxidation state in the UV–visible spectra of the
PANI base forms and could cause increased concentration of benzenoid
units in the PANI base chains detected by FTIR spectroscopy. To prove
or exclude such nature of structure defects in PANI chains, we have
measured the UV–visible spectra in NMP containing 0.5 vol %
of triethanolamine and 0.5 wt % of lithium bromide. The obtained spectra
(not shown) exhibited a slightly increased (relatively to the band
at ≈334 nm) intensity of the band at 630 nm compared to the
measurements in solvent without addition of lithium bromide, but its
absorbance decreased with the increase of [BzQ] and maintained the
trends observed in Figure 3B. As addition of lithium bromide should result in cleavage
of hydrogen bonds, we conclude that structural defects have to be
attached on PANI backbones by covalent bonds or have to be part of
PANI chains which affect both the extent of electron delocalization
and PANI oxidation state. On the other hand, hydrogen bonding between
PANI and 2,5-dianilino-p-benzoquinone most probably
affects supramolecular structure of PANI in solid phase. We speculate
that this effect changes the supramolecular structure of PANI bases
prepared with [BzQ] ≥ 0.02 M and thus allows measurement of
conductivity of these PANI bases by van der Pauw method (see above).

Scheme 5 Assumed Hydrogen Bonding of 2,5-Dianilino-p-benzoquinone
and PANI Chain
According to the
observation of a weak and relatively broad signal
at ca. 95 ppm in the 13C CP/MAS NMR spectra of PANI bases
prepared with [BzQ] = 0.002−0.02 M (Figure 8), we expect rather an incorporation of 2,5-dianilino-p-benzoquinone-like moiety into PANI chains. Structure units
fulfilling this precondition were previously suggested by Venancio
et al.51 (Scheme 6): p-benzoquinone can be
either bonded to PANI chains as a pendant group (Scheme 6A) or it can be a part of a
PANI chain (Scheme 6B). The incorporation of 2,5-dianilino-p-benzoquinone
moiety into a PANI chain (Scheme 6B) might be possible because of a reaction of a growing
PANI chain with p-benzoquinone and up to two growing
chains could be connected to a molecule of p-benzoquinone.
However, this would result in a decrease of molecular-weight values
and a narrowing of the molecular-weight distribution with the increase
of [BzQ], which was not observed. The pendant p-benzoquinone
group on the PANI chain (Scheme 6A) thus seems to be in better agreement with experimental
data. We have just two pieces of indirect information on the nature
of structure defects: (1) a weak and relatively broad signal at ca.
95 ppm in the 13C CP/MAS NMR spectra of PANI bases prepared
with [BzQ] = 0.002−0.02 M (Figure 8), suggesting 2,5-diamino-p-benzoquinone ring to be a part of the PANI structure as a pendant
group. (2) Occurrence of the band C=O stretching vibration
observed at 1637 cm–1 even in the FTIR spectra of
the products prepared with [BzQ] = 0–0.02 M (Figure 5B), that is, at the wavenumber
position of the C=O stretching vibrations in 2,5-dianilino-p-benzoquinone (see Figure 5B). In our opinion, the structure we propose in Scheme 7 might be in better
agreement with these preconditions than the structure suggested by
Venancio et al. (Scheme 6A).51 Regarding the formation of a pendant
5-anilino-p-benzoquinone-2-yl group, we speculate
that it generates by a reaction of p-benzoquinone
with one molecule of aniline and one PANI chain and the reaction proceeds
in analogy with the reaction of p-benzoquinone with
two molecules of aniline.

Conclusions
The structure and properties of the products
prepared by the oxidation
of 0.2 M aniline hydrochloride with 0.25 M APS have been investigated
under concentrations of p-benzoquinone varying from
0 to 0.2 M. It was shown that p-benzoquinone does
not act as a termination agent in the oxidative polymerization of
aniline. Formed products consisted of two components: (1) PANI with
weight-average molecular weight between 15 000 and 23 000
and dispersity between 3 and 4 and (2) low-molecular-weight byproduct,
2,5-dianilino-p-benzoquinone. The content of 2,5-dianilino-p-benzoquinone increased with the increasing concentration
of p-benzoquinone in the reaction medium. This has
been deduced from the increasing yield and the SEC, FTIR, XPS, and
NMR analyses of the products.

The molecular structure of PANI
depended on the amount of p-benzoquinone added into
the reaction mixture. Raman spectra
have shown that the PANI doping level and the charge delocalization
both decrease with the increasing concentration of p-benzoquinone. This is in agreement with observations in the UV–visible
spectra of both protonated samples and bases, indicating that the
chain regularity was disturbed, despite no change in molecular weight
was observed. The FTIR spectra of the PANI base forms have shown an
increased concentration of benzenoid units in PANI chains. According
to the 13C CP/MAS NMR spectra and the FTIR spectra, we
assume the presence of the pendant 5-anilino-p-benzoquinone-2-yl
group on PANI nitrogen atoms as structure defects, which affects both
the geometry of PANI chains and the extent of polaron delocalization.
Furthermore, the bands typical of p-benzoquinone
were observed even in the Raman spectra of PANI prepared without addition
of p-benzoquinone. This confirms in situ oxidation
of aniline to p-benzoquinone as an alternative route
in the oxidation of aniline hydrochloride with APS leading to PANI.

Materials
and Methods
Chemicals
Aniline hydrochloride (98%; Penta, Czech
Republic), APS (98%; Lach-Ner, Czech Republic), p-benzoquinone (≥98%; Sigma-Aldrich), hydrochloric acid (p.a.,
35%; Lach-Ner, Czech Republic), ammonium hydroxide (p.a., 25%; Lach-Ner,
Czech Republic), triethanolamine (p.a.; Lach-Ner, Czech Republic), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP; ≥99%; Carl-Roth, Czech
Republic), lithium bromide (Sigma-Aldrich, Czech Republic), and 2,5-dianilino-p-benzoquinone (Specs Research Laboratory, Delft, Netherlands)
were used as supplied.

Preparation
Aniline hydrochloride
(0.2 M) oxidation
with APS (0.25 M), that is, at the oxidant-to-monomer mole ratio 1.25,
was carried out under various concentrations of p-benzoquinone (0–0.2 M). Briefly, equal volumes (50 mL) of
aqueous solution of aniline hydrochloride (20 mmol) and of aqueous
solution containing both APS (25 mmol) and p-benzoquinone
(0–20 mmol) were mixed in a beaker, briefly stirred and left
to react for 24 h at room temperature. The obtained solids were isolated
by filtration, rinsed with 0.2 M hydrochloric acid and then with acetone,
and dried in air and then over silica gel. Parts of each sample were
deprotonated to convert a PANI salt to a PANI base by suspension in
a large excess of 1 M ammonium hydroxide for 48 h, subsequently washed
with water and acetone, and dried as described above.

Characterization
SEC was performed on a Calc 100 chromatograph
(Labio, Czech Republic) equipped with a PLgel mixed-C column (Polymer
Laboratories, UK) using NMP containing 0.005 g cm–3 of lithium bromide as the eluent at the flow rate of 0.50 mL min–1. Samples in base forms were dissolved in mobile phase
containing 0.005 g cm–3 of triethanolamine. Detection
of the analytes was done spectrophotometrically at 340 nm. The system
was calibrated by polystyrene standards using refractive index detection.

Room-temperature conductivity of PANI salts and some bases was
determined by a four-point method in van der Pauw arrangement using
a Keithley 220 Programmable Current Source, a Keithley 2010 Multimeter
as a voltmeter, and a Keithley 705 Scanner equipped with a Keithley
7052 Matrix Card on PANI powder compressed to pellets of 13 mm in
diameter and ≈1 mm thickness with a manual hydraulic press
at 530 MPa. A two-point method was used for PANI bases with a Keithley
6517 electrometer/high resistance system at voltages 10, 100, and
1000 V. Before these measurements, circular gold electrodes were deposited
on both sides of the pellets. Let us mention that there are principal
differences between measurements by the four-point method in van der
Pauw arrangement and by the two-point method with circular gold electrodes
deposited on both sides of the pellets. The four-point van der Pauw
method uses separate voltage and current contacts, which is not the
case of the two-point method. The measured current is perpendicular
to the axis of cylindrical samples within van der Pauw measurements,
whereas it is parallel with this axis for the two-point method. Pellets
for measurements are prepared by pressing, and certain anisotropy
in resistivity thus has to be expected. Because of this reason, it
is useful to compare the results obtained by both methods as they
do not describe the same. If the conductivity of samples is low, modified
van der Pauw methods have to be used.52

Temperature dependence of the resistivity in the range from
about
5 K up to 320 K was measured in a closed-cycle cryostat OmniPlex GMX19
with the second stage of a Model DE-204SL DE-210SF expander and an
ARS-10HW helium compressor made by Advanced Research Systems, Inc.
As a temperature controller, the LakeShore Model 336 was used. The
measured sample was held in a flowing stream of helium vapor, which
provides a good control over the temperature homogeneity in the samples.
Before temperature measurements, the sample chamber with samples has
been evacuated (ca. 0.1–0.01 Pa) for several hours at room
temperature (at about 305 K) to get rid of moisture. When the resistivity
of the samples is about 103 Ω cm or higher, the four-point
van der Pauw method in a modified configuration can be used. The corresponding
experimental setup used a Keithley 6220 programmable current source,
a Keithley 6485 picoammeter, a Keithley 2000 multimeter, a Keithley
706 scanner equipped with a Keithley 7152l low-current matrix card,
and two Keithley 6517B electrometers as high impedance voltmeters.
In such configuration, the so-called common-mode current is reduced
because low impedance terminals of all devices are not floating but
are connected and grounded together. For more details, see ref (52).

UV–visible
spectra were recorded on a Lambda 20 spectrometer
(PerkinElmer, UK) using quartz cuvettes and PANI solutions in NMP
with 0.5 vol % of triethanolamine for PANI bases or in NMP with 0.5
vol % hydrochloric acid for PANI salts. Infrared spectra were recorded
using a Thermo Nicolet NEXUS 870 FTIR Spectrometer (DTGS TEC detector;
region 4000–400 cm–1; 64 scans; resolution
2 cm–1) in transmission mode in potassium bromide
pellets. The spectra were corrected for carbon dioxide and humidity
in the optical path. Raman spectra were collected on a Renishaw inVia
Reflex Raman spectrometer (Leica DM LM microscope; objective magnification
×50) with a HeNe 633 nm laser (holographic grating 1800 lines
mm–1) and a near-infrared diode 785 nm laser (1200
lines mm–1) at three different spots of the samples
spread on a steel support.

XPS measurements were carried out
with a K-Alpha+ spectrometer
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, East Grinstead, UK). The samples were analyzed
using a micro-focused, monochromated Al Kα X-ray source (400
μm spot size) at an angle of incidence of 30° (measured
from the surface) and an emission angle normal to the surface. The
kinetic energy of the electrons was measured using a 180° hemispherical
energy analyzer operated in the constant analyzer energy mode at 200
and 50 eV pass energy for the survey and high-resolution spectra,
respectively. Data acquisition and processing were performed using
a Thermo Advantage software. The XPS spectra were fitted with Voigt
profiles obtained by convolving Lorentzian and Gaussian functions.
The analyzer transmission function, Scofield sensitivity factors,
and effective attenuation lengths (EALs) for photoelectrons were applied
for quantification. EALs were calculated using the standard TPP-2M
formalism. The binding energy (BE) scale was controlled by the well-known
position of the photoelectron C–C and C–H, C–O,
and C(=O)–O C 1s peaks of polyethylene terephthalate
and Cu 2p, Ag 3d, and Au 4f peaks of metallic Cu, Ag, and Au, respectively.
The BE uncertainty of the reported measurements and analysis is in
the range of ±0.1 eV.

Solid-state NMR (ss-NMR) spectra
were performed on a Bruker AVANCE
500 WB/US NMR (Karlsruhe, Germany, 2013) at 11.7 T in 4 mm ZrO2 rotors at a MAS frequency of 11 kHz. The 13C CP
MAS NMR spectra were measured by applying a B1(13C) field nutation frequency of 62.5 kHz, a contact
time of 1 ms, and a recycle delay of 5 s. The number of spectra accumulation
was 1k–16k to reach acceptable signal-to-noise ratio. The 13C NMR signals were acquired under the high-power 1H dipolar decoupling SPINAL 64. Powdered crystalline glycine was
used as an external standard to calibrate 13C NMR scale
(176.03 ppm—low-field carbonyl signal). The sample temperature
was kept constant at 295 K. To compensate frictional heating of the
sample, active cooling was applied. The actual sample temperature
was calibrated by monitoring the 207Pb chemical shift in
Pb(NO3)2 at various temperatures.53

DFT Calculations
The quantum chemical
calculations
were performed at the DFT level of theory with the CAM-B3LYP hybrid
exchange–correlation functional54 combined with the 6-311+G(d,p) basis set. The molecular geometry
was fully optimized using the Gaussian 16 program package.55 The vibrational frequencies were used to verify
that the optimized structures were true minima. The solvent effect
was analyzed on the gas-phase optimized structure with the polarizable
continuum model. The excitation energies and the corresponding UV–visible
absorption spectra were calculated employing the TD-DFT framework.56
