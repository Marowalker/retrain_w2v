Self-assembly of semiconductor nanocrystals
(NCs) into two-dimensional
patterns or three-dimensional (2-3D) superstructures has emerged as
a promising low-cost route to generate thin-film transistors and solar
cells with superior charge transport because of enhanced electronic
coupling between the NCs. Here, we show that lead sulfide (PbS) NCs
solids featuring either short-range (disordered glassy solids, GSs)
or long-range (superlattices, SLs) packing order are obtained solely
by controlling deposition conditions of colloidal solution of NCs.
In this study, we demonstrate the use of the evaporation-driven self-assembly
method results in PbS NC SL structures that are observed over an area
of 1 mm × 100 μm, with long-range translational order of
up to 100 nm. A number of ordered domains appear to have nucleated
simultaneously and grown together over the whole area, imparting a
polycrystalline texture to the 3D SL films. By contrast, a conventional,
optimized spin-coating deposition method results in PbS NC glassy
films with no translational symmetry and much shorter-range packing
order in agreement with state-of-the-art reports. Further, we investigate
the electronic properties of both SL and GS films, using a field-effect
transistor configuration as a test platform. The long-range ordering
of the PbS NCs into SLs leads to semiconducting NC-based solids, the
mobility (μ) of which is 3 orders of magnitude higher than that
of the disordered GSs. Moreover, although spin-cast GSs of PbS NCs
have weak ambipolar behavior with limited gate tunability, SLs of
PbS NCs show a clear p-type behavior with significantly higher conductivities.

Introduction
Semiconductor
nanocrystals (NCs) display strong size-dependent
optical and electronic properties due to the quantum confinement of
the electronic wavefunctions.1,2 Recent advances in synthetic
approaches for semiconductor NCs have enabled atomic-scale control
of composition, size, size dispersion, shape, and crystal structure
of the resulting colloids.3,4 The use of short-chain
ligands, molecular solders,5−8 and post-thermal or chemical treatments of NC solids
has enabled improved charge transport through NC films. However, all
of the aforementioned methods drastically change the surface chemistry
of the final NC solids.

Although improvements in inter-NCs coupling
are exciting, the ability
to prepare self-assembled NC superstructures over large areas (wafer
scale) by controlling the formation of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional
(3D) networks with a high degree of order is still low.9,10 In fact, the formation of periodicity with long-range ordering in
self-assembled NC superstructures has been limited by fast dewetting
of a volatile solvent and polarity of the solvent. Therefore, the
ability to preserve the periodicity as well as long-range crystalline
order over a large scale is one of the key challenges preventing the
application of 2D or 3D NC solids for low-cost production of nanoelectronics
by roll-to-roll fabrication.

In this scenario, the NC superlattice
(SL) assembly can be leveraged
to combine the advantages of tunable quantum-confined energy levels
provided by quantum dots with enhanced charge transport due to the
improved electronic coupling between NCs, thus leading to improved
performance. However, although theoretical models have been proposed
to investigate the effects of ordering on the electronic transport
in semiconductor NC assemblies, experimental results on the effect
of structural order on electronic properties are still a challenge.11−13

PbS NCs are one of the most extensively investigated systems
for
several applications, including solar cells, photodetectors, and light-emitting
devices in the near-infrared (NIR) region because of their tunable
synthesis, optimal band gap range, and high optical absorption.14,15 In spite of their interesting optoelectronic properties, PbS NCs
have rarely been used for transistor-based devices because of their
extremely low charge carrier mobilities in thin films.16,17 The main reason for this is the difficulty of controlling the arrangement
of PbS NCs in a solid film at both nano-18 and macro-scales.19

In this study,
we control the assembly of PbS over multiple length
scales, from short to long range, and demonstrate that the extent
of ordering can be a dominant factor for efficient charge transport
in NC films. The evaporation-driven self-assembly of PbS NCs results
in SL structures with an area greater than 1 mm × 100 μm.
The SLs have ordered domains, which appear to have nucleated and grown
together to cover the whole area, imparting a polycrystalline texture
to 3D SL films. Conversely, conventional spin-coating deposition of
PbS NCs leads to glassy solids (GSs) with a much shorter range of
packing order and no long-range translational order. We investigate
the electronic properties of both GS and SL films using a field-effect
transistor (FET) configuration as a testing platform. Our results
highlight that the long-range ordering arising from the close-packed
arrangement of PbS NCs into SLs leads to semiconducting NC-based solids
with a charge carrier mobility up to 3 orders of magnitude higher
than that of disordered GSs. Further, GS films of PbS NCs show a weak
ambipolar behavior with limited gate tunability, whereas SL films
of PbS NCs show a p-type behavior with significantly higher conductivities,
thus providing experimental evidence of the effect of the extent of
packing order on the electrical properties of an NC semiconductor
solid.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis and Structural Characterization
of PbS NCs
Hot-injection synthesis is used to prepare 4.2
nm PbS NCs with spherical
shape and size distribution of 11%, according to a previously described
protocol.20 Briefly, the synthesis is carried
out using a lead oleate (PbOA) precursor mixed with lead(II) oxide
(PbO) and oleic acid (OA) in 1-octadecene (ODE). A solution of bis(trimethylsilyl)
sulfide in ODE is injected into the mixture at 100 °C under nitrogen
to induce nucleation and growth of PbS NCs, thereby ultimately forming
a stable colloidal suspension.3,21,22

Quantitative structural and chemical analyses of the as-synthesized
PbS NCs are performed with transmission electron microscopy (TEM),
UV–vis spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction (XRD), the results
of which are summarized in Figure 1. A growth time of 5 min results in uniform, nearly
spherical PbS NCs, as shown in the TEM image in Figure 1a. The size distribution histogram (Figure 1b) reveals a mean
particle size of 4.2 nm with a standard deviation of 0.4 nm. The crystal
structure and average crystallite size were confirmed by XRD, as shown
in Figure 1c. The as-synthesized
PbS NCs have a lattice constant of 5.94 Å and a face-centered
cubic (fcc) crystal structure similar to that of bulk PbS. The absorbance
spectrum (Figure 1d)
shows the presence of an excitonic peak at ∼1.066 eV (1163
nm), indicating that the as-synthesized PbS quantum dots demonstrate
quantum confinement because bulk PbS has a band gap (measured at the
band edge) of ∼0.41 eV (3024 nm). By correlating the position
of the first exciton peak in the absorbance spectra with the mean
NC diameter (dNC), we were able to determine dNC optically, avoiding a lengthy TEM analysis
for each synthesis run.23

spectrum, with a distinct excitonic peak at 1163 nm.

Preparation and Characterization of PbS NC
SL Membranes and
Disordered Glassy Films
Lithography-free approaches to control
the arrangement of NCs over large length scales for electrical devices
are in high demand. Ordered arrangement of NCs enhances interparticle
coupling, resulting in bandlike transport, which in turn results in
devices with enhanced electrical performance. Liquid–air interfacial
assembly techniques, such as the Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) method,
are widely employed to prepare ordered NC monolayers.24 However, monolayers of small NCs with long-range order
are difficult to obtain with the LB method, limiting its suitability
for large-scale device applications.25 In
the last few years, significant efforts have concentrated on generating
SL membranes and thin-film solids (TFs) from various colloidal NC
systems.26−28

Evaporation-driven self-assembly of NCs on
the surface of a polar organic subphase at room temperature (RT) results
in 3D SL membranes with long-range translational order of up to 100
nm.29,30 The fabrication method is depicted in Figure 2. First, 150 μL
of 50 mg/mL PbS NCs in octane is drop-cast on the surface of acetonitrile
(ACN) in a ∼2 × 2 cm Teflon well (Figure 2a). The growth of SLs is driven by an evaporation-mediated
self-assembly process (Figure 2b), yielding a membrane supported on the surface of the polar
organic subphase after the complete evaporation of octane (∼10
min), as shown in Figure 2b. This liquid-supported membrane can be readily scooped up
and transferred to TEM grids or SiO2/Si wafers for characterization
(Figure 2c). Held together
by van der Waals forces, the PbS NCs cocrystallize into SLs.

Figure 2 Schematic of
the growth of an SL membrane by evaporation-mediated
self-assembly of NCs on an immiscible liquid surface, using ACN and
NCs in octane solution. (a) A small volume of NCs in octane is drop-cast
on top of the ACN surface. (b) The growth of 3D SLs is induced by
evaporation of octane, yielding a final membrane supported by the
subphase after ∼10 min. The membrane keeps growing and sliding
unidirectionally until the evaporation of octane is complete. (c)
The resulting free-standing NC membrane can be transferred from the
subphase surface to any substrate by “scooping” it up.

Figure 3 shows scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) and TEM images of the as-synthesized PbS
SL membrane at different magnifications. Figure 3a shows an SEM image of a 100 μm ×
100 μm area of SiO2/Si substrate (1 cm × 1 cm)
coated with an as-synthesized SL layer consisting of 4.2 nm PbS NCs.
The formation of SLs is strongly affected by the solvent evaporation
process (Figure 2),
which depends on several factors, such as fluctuations in solvent
density and nanoparticle diffusion.31,40

analysis of PbS SL membrane. (a) SEM image of SL
membranes of 4 nm PbS NCs transferred on top of SiO2/Si
wafer substrates. (b) TEM image showing the effect of thermocapillary
convective flows resulting in an elongated macrostructure of PbS NCs.
(c) TEM image of typical PbS SL membranes. The PbS NCs cocrystallize
into SLs with relatively large grain sizes (∼100 nm), with
different growth directions or lattice plane projections, as evidenced
by the grain boundaries between adjacent domains. (d) TEM image of
an SL with a clear periodicity of 5.7 nm. The inset is the selected-area
electron diffraction (SAED) pattern showing that the individual quantum
dots forming the SL have the same crystallographic structure as bulk
PbS (fcc, a = 5.8 Å) and no preferred crystallographic
orientation with respect to one another, evidenced by the rings in
the diffraction pattern as opposed to individual Bragg reflection
spots.

Moreover, the evaporation rate
of high-boiling-point solvents can
dramatically affect the dimensionality of SLs. Changing the evaporation
rate can lead to either 2D or 3D SL formation using the same NCs.8 In our procedure, octane replaces commonly used
high-boiling-point solvents such as tetrachloroethylene (TCE), allowing
the assembly process to be completed in several minutes.32,33 Convection driven by solvent evaporation in addition to electrostatic
and van der Waals interactions modifies the particle assembly process.
As reported in the literature, the origins of micron-scale structures
of locally ordered assemblies of NCs are related to both the solvent
evaporation rate and subphase viscosity.34,35 Those macroscale structures formed in our SL membranes are shown
in Figure 3a. We believe
that thermocapillary convective flows engendered within an evaporating
particle suspension give rise to the elongated micron-scale structures
of PbS, as shown in Figure 3a.

In general, we observe uniform as-synthesized SL
membranes of PbS
NCs covering areas up to 1 × 1 mm2, demonstrating
the high quality of the drying-mediated, self-assembled SLs. Low-magnification
TEM imaging (Figure 3b,d) shows the long-range order of the 3D SL of PbS NCs. In this
image, a number of ordered domains appear to have nucleated simultaneously
and grown together, imparting a polycrystalline texture to the 3D
SL. Figure 3d shows
an SL with a clear periodicity of 5.7 nm. The SAED pattern (Figure 3d, inset) shows that
individual NCs have the same atomic crystallographic structure as
bulk PbS (fcc, a = 5.8 Å) and no preferred atomic
crystallographic orientation with respect to one another, as evidenced
by the rings in the diffraction pattern as opposed to individual Bragg
reflection spots. Orientations were determined by fast Fourier transforms
(FFTs) of the TEM images in Figure S1.
The FFT of the image in Figure S1a (inset)
shows that in the PbS SL structure there is a preferred orientation
of the crystal domains, which corresponds to the brightest spots in
the FFT. A quantitative structural characterization of the extent
of ordered packing of the SL films is reported in Figure 4. The FFT in the inset of Figure 4a shows domains of
different crystallographic orientations of NCs in a 500 × 500
nm2 area of an SL membrane. The false-color image in Figure 4b illustrates the
typical domain size of ∼100 nm observed in the SL membranes.

typical PbS SL membrane (inset: FFT). (b) False-color composite image
of (a) made by masking the colored circles in the FFT. The false-color
image illustrates the typical domain size of ∼100 nm observed
in the SL membranes.

Electron microscopy (both SEM and TEM) characterization is
also
performed on PbS films, which have been spin-cast onto SiO2/Si substrates (1 cm × 1 cm). Figure 5a shows the SEM image (100 μm ×
100 μm) of a PbS film obtained via a layer-by-layer (LbL) sequential
spin-coating technique. The LbL spin-coating process is employed to
improve the surface coverage of the film. It is well known that the
thickness of the final film depends on the thickness of the dispersion
layer on the substrate surface at the final rotation speed; this value
is influenced by the viscosity and surface tension of the NC solution.36 Because there is a surface tension gradient
in the NC solution during the spin-coating process, the final coating
gives rise to an incomplete surface coverage, forming PbS NC clusters
that are similar in density and size but leaving sections of the substrate
surface free of PbS NCs (Figure 5a). A low-magnification TEM image of a PbS NC solid
after a single spin-coating step at RT is shown in Figure 5b. The film is spin-cast on
top of an electron-transparent 20 nm silicon nitride TEM window mounted
on a 2.12 mm silicon chip. Higher-magnification TEM images (Figure 5c) show uniformity
in the size and shape of the NCs. We observe that by spin-coating
NCs on a silicon nitride substrate short-range order is partially
preserved but long-range translational order is not present (Figure 5c,d) and the NCs
tend to cluster in small close-packed domains (Figure 5d). The orientations of NCs in these PbS
thin films were determined by using FFTs of the TEM images, such as
the one in Figure S1b. The FFT image (Figure S1b, inset) shows that no preferred crystallographic
orientation exists in the PbS thin film, with disordered NC subphases
leading to a “glassy” thin film, that possess short-range
order but lacks long-range translational order (Figure 5), thus limiting its applicability for device
applications.

substrates. The scale bar is 10 μm. (b–d) TEM images

colloidal solutions onto 20 nm silicon nitride TEM windows.

Postdeposition chemical activation
of both SL and GS films is carried
out through hydrazine (N2H4) treatment,35,11 with the aim of investigating the effect of a 4 h hydrazine treatment
on both uniformity and homogeneity on the NC solids (Figure 6). Figure 6a shows the SEM image of a 100 μm ×
100 μm area of a typical as-deposited SL layer. The SEM image
in Figure 6b shows
an SL membrane after the hydrazine treatment; the hydrazine-treated
SL membrane maintains its uniformity over large length scales, up
to 1 cm2 area with no holes or cracks.

transferred on top of SiO2/Si wafer substrates (a, c) before
and (b, d) after 1 M hydrazine treatment for 4 h, so as to investigate
the influence of the ligand exchange treatment on the uniformity and
homogeneity of the final NC solids.

For comparison, a similar electron microscopy characterization
is performed on a spin-cast PbS GS film before and after hydrazine
treatment. Spin-cast PbS GS films typically lead to much thinner films
compared to those synthesized by the SL approach. To make a fair comparison,
sequential spin-coating deposition steps are employed to produce films
with similar thicknesses (140 nm) to the SL membranes (∼100
nm, Figure 7b). SEM
images in Figure 6c,d
show a PbS NC glassy film obtained by our sequential spin-coating
technique before (Figure 6c) and after (Figure 6d) hydrazine treatment. The short-range order of the final
PbS glassy film is not affected by this chemical process (Figure 6d), and the nonuniform
morphology typical of glassy films before hydrazine treatment is retained.37

Charge-Transport Characterization of PbS
SL and GS Films Using
an FET Platform
For charge-transport studies,
a PbS SL-FET is fabricated by transferring the liquid-supported SL
membrane (Results and Discussion) to SiO2/Si wafer substrates that were prepatterned with source and
drain Cr/Au electrodes. Figure 7a shows a schematic cross section of the PbS SL-FET used in
this study, where the PbS SL membrane forms a solid-state channel
between drain and source contacts. The width (W)
and length (L) of the channels were 1 mm and 100
μm, respectively. The as-deposited PbS SL membranes were fairly
insulating because of the presence of OA ligands on their surface,
which impede charge transport. To enhance electronic coupling between
neighboring NCs, postsynthesis hydrazine treatment for 4 h was performed
on the PbS SL-FET device. The effect of the hydrazine is to reduce
the interparticle spacing between NCs and in turn increase the conductivity
of the NC film, as previously reported for PbSe and PbS NC FETs.33,35

Figure 7b shows
a typical SEM cross section of PbS SL membranes integrated between
the drain–source terminals of the FET and exploited for electrical
characterization purposes, after hydrazine treatment. The PbS SL on
top of the SiO2 dielectric has a fairly uniform film thickness
(tSL = 100 nm) over the whole channel
length and width. A thorough electrical characterization of hydrazine-treated
SL-FET is performed in a nitrogen atmosphere at RT. In Figure 7, representative output curves ID–VDS (Figure 7c) and transfer curves ID–VGS (Figure 7d) of hydrazine-treated
SL-FET devices are reported. Figure 7c shows drain current (ID) versus drain voltage (VDS) scans in
the range of 0 to −40 V at various gate voltages (VG) ranging from 0 to −40 V. SL-FET output curves
for drain voltage (VDS) scans in the range
of 0 to +40 V are shown in Figure S2a.
The absolute current between source and drain electrodes, |ID|, increases linearly with VDS in the range of 0 to −25 V (Figure 7c); however, it tends to saturate
on increasing the VDS value over −25
V, as the channel “pinches off” near the drain electrode.
An effective modulation of the ID current
flowing through the SL film by application of a negative back-gate
voltage is apparent, which is typical of a p-type FET. Figure 7d shows that the absolute value
of ID increases with increasing negative
values of VG at fixed VDS of −20 V, with current modulation ratio (ION/IOFF) of ∼9.
A significant hysteresis over the dynamic range of operation (−40
to +40 V) of VG is evident in the transfer
characteristics of Figure 7d. This effect can be related to the filling of traps associated
with dangling bonds on the unpassivated sulfur surface,38 although this effect has not been investigated
in detail in this study. The transfer characteristics apparent in Figure 7d confirms the p-type
behavior of the NC SL film with charge accumulation at negative gate
voltages. The mobility of the PbS NC FET was estimated from the linear
regime.

For comparison, we performed an electrical characterization
with
similar parameters for the PbS NC GS films obtained by spin casting
and treated with hydrazine for 4 h. In a nitrogen glovebox, thin films
of NCs were prepared by employing an LbL spin-coating deposition technique
using the same oleic acid-passivated PbS NCs used for the SL membranes
dispersed in hexane solution on the SiO2/Si substrate,
which was prepatterned with source and drain Cr/Au electrodes. Figure 8a shows typical drain
current (ID)–drain voltage (VDS) characteristics for the bottom-gated PbS
GS FET measured at different negative gate voltages (VG) in the negative VD sweep
regimes. A small increase of the current flowing through the NC film
was observed in the VD range of 0 to −25
V, regardless of the VG value between
0 and −40 V, with the maximum current value |ID| = 130 nA at VG = 0 V. Moreover,
at any given VDS value, a small |ID| modulation is observed on increasing the
magnitude of VG from 0 to −40 V.
PbS GS FET output curves for drain voltage (VDS) scans in the range of 0 to +40 V are shown in Figure S2b. To explain the poor electrical behavior
of the NC GS films, we refer to the SEM images in Figure 6d, in which one can clearly
observe that PbS NC films subjected to 4 h of hydrazine treatment
were discontinuous with micron-sized NC aggregates that were not fully
connected, thus leaving some portion of the SiO2 surface
free from PbS NCs. The morphology of NC GS films results in poor conductivity.
From the transfer characteristics reported in Figure 8b, a low-voltage ambipolar behavior is evident
for PbS GS FET with both electron and hole conduction. A switching
of the majority carrier is observed from the plot of drain current
(ID) versus gate voltage (VG) characteristics at fixed values of VD (e.g., VD = −20 V),
as shown in Figure 8b. Characteristic V-shaped ambipolar curves were obtained, where
the right wing (positive VG) represents
electron transport and the left wing (negative VG) represents hole transport. Some hysteresis was evident,
which may be explained by carrier trapping. Because of the difference
in the current levels for electron and hole conduction, an asymmetry
in the V-shape was observed. This arises from differences in the mobility
between electrons and holes, as reported in the literature.14 Similar effects are observed in ethanedithiol-exchanged
PbSe NC-based FETs that are moderately conductive and ambipolar in
the dark.39

(a) Typical drain current (ID)–drain
voltage (VDS) characteristics for the
bottom-gated thin-film PbS NC GS FET measured at different gate voltages
(VG) in the negative VD sweep regimes (width and length of the channels were
1 mm and 100 μm, respectively). (b) Transfer curve with a fixed
drain–source voltage of −20 V.

For comparison with the PbS SL-FET, we assessed the mobility
of
PbS GS films and found that it is 3 orders of magnitude lower, with
a value of 4.36 × 10–11 cm2/V s,
than that of the PbS SL-FET (μSL = 7.09 × 10–8 cm2/V s).

For electronic devices
based on NCs, PbS NC solids combine the
advantages of tunable quantum-confined energy levels with fast charge
transport owing to the enhanced electronic coupling between NCs that
can be improved via controlled ligand exchange. Moreover, assembling
hierarchically organized NC solids that display highly periodic patterns
over areas spanning square centimeters presents an immense potential
for the fabrication of NC-based transistors with enhanced electrical
mobility.40

Conclusions
In
our study, an NC assembly method is successfully demonstrated
as a powerful, lithography-free approach to fabricate large-area NCs
assemblies over square centimeter areas that display either short-range
(disordered GSs) or long-range (SLs) packing order. We show the dependence
of the electronic properties of PbS NCs on their packing order. The
long-range ordering arising from the close-packed arrangement of PbS
NC SLs leads to higher-conductivity NC solids with respect to PbS
NC GSs. In particular, we observe a strong p-type character in PbS
NC SL-thin-film-based FETs compared to that in disordered spin-cast
films, which show minimal gate modulation. Additionally, SL films
show enhanced mobility (greater than 3 orders of magnitude) compared
to that of glassy films. In summary, evaporation-mediated self-assembly
processes combined with hydrazine treatment has been demonstrated
as a promising approach to exert efficient control over particle separation
in densely packed 3D SL assemblies of semiconductor NCs over square
centimeter areas.

Experimental Section
Chemicals
Lead(II)
oxide (99.999%), ODE (90%), OA (90%),
bis(trimethylsilyl)sulfide (TMS2S), TCE (99%), anhydrous hydrazine
(98%), and anhydrous ACN were purchased from Aldrich. Methanol, acetone,
hexane, chloroform, ACN, and ethanol were of analytical grade and
obtained from various sources. All chemicals were used as received
except hydrazine, which was additionally purified by distillation.
OA and lead oxide were dried in a Schlenk line for 2 h under vacuum
and stored in a nitrogen glovebox.

PbS NC Synthesis
For the synthesis protocol, 0.225
g of PbO, 5 mL of OA, and 5 mL of ODE were loaded in a 25 mL three-neck
flask. The mixture was heated to 150 °C under vacuum to form
Pb–oleate complex. The synthesis of PbS NCs was followed by
the hot-injection method, in which 0.13 mL of TMS2S was dissolved
in 2 mL of ODE under stirring. The solution was injected at 100 °C
under nitrogen. A rapid nucleation event occurs upon the injection
of the S precursor into the Pb–oleate mixture, as evidenced
by an immediate color change to brown in the reaction vessel. The
reaction mixture was kept at 100 °C under nitrogen for 2–4
min (time growth) and then cooled to RT using a water bath. Key assets
of the hot-injection synthesis
routine have excellent control over NC size and the narrow size dispersion
of resulting colloids. After cooling to RT, the nanoparticles were
precipitated from the crude solution by adding a hexane/ethanol (3:1)
mixture, followed by centrifugation. Precipitated NCs were redissolved
in hexane (∼2 mL) and precipitated again with ethanol. PbS
NCs were resuspended in octane, hexane, or TCE and used for further
preparation and characterization.

Sample Characterization
TEM, powder XRD, and NIR absorption
spectroscopy are used to characterize the size, shape, structure,
composition, and optical properties of the PbS NCs.

Characterization
of particle size, shape, and morphology is carried out via TEM imaging.
Samples were prepared by placing 10 μL of a diluted NC solution
in toluene or TCE on a 400-mesh carbon-coated copper grid (Ted Pella,
Inc.). TEM images were obtained using a JEOL 2100-F 200 kV field-emission
analytical transmission electron microscope operating at an acceleration
voltage of 120 kV. The particle size and size distribution were calculated
on the basis of measurements of at least 100 NCs.

Thin-film
characterization is carried out via SEM imaging. Samples
were prepared by spin-coating 50 mg/mL PbS solution in hexane on top
of an FET device. Top-view images of the NC thin film obtained were
acquired using a Zeiss Gemini Ultra-55 analytical field-emission scanning
electron microscope operating at 3 kV. The homogeneity and continuity
of the PbS NC thin film between the source and drain contacts were
analyzed. UV–vis spectroscopy is used to characterize the optical
properties of the PbS NCs. For optical absorption measurements, intensively
washed (up to three times) NCs were redispersed in TCE. Linear optical
absorption spectra were recorded on an ASD QualitySpec Pro UV–vis
spectrometer.

Wide-angle powder XRD measurements were carried
out on a Bruker
AXS D8 Discover GADDS X-ray diffractometer operating in the Bragg–Brentano
configuration with Co Kα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å),
with scatter and diffraction slits of 1°. Samples for wide-angle
XRD measurements are prepared by depositing concentrated PbS NC solutions
in hexane onto a silicon surface.

Self-Assembly and Transfer
of SL Membranes
In a typical
assembly process, 50 mg/mL PbS in octane solution was spread on the
ACN solution surface in a Teflon well. The well was covered with a
glass slide to slowly control the evaporation of the octane through
the gaps between the Teflon surface and the glass slide. Ordered SLs
formed upon evaporation of the solvent on top of the liquid–air
interface. To transfer PbS SLs, a substrate (e.g., silicon nitride
20 nm floating membrane TEM windows, silicon substrate, SiO2/Si (100 nm) substrates) was placed under the floating membrane using
tweezers and then gently lifted upward to collect the membrane. The
subsequent drying in a vacuum chamber removed residual ACN. Close-packed
PbS NCs in SL arrangement were treated with hydrazine by dipping the
wafers into a 1.0 M solution of hydrazine in anhydrous ACN. The duration
of the treatment was 4 h, followed by rinsing the device with anhydrous
ACN. The hydrazine-treated NC film is insoluble in common solvents
such as hexane and chloroform.

Structural Characterization of PbS SL Membranes
TEM
was used to characterize the homogeneity and continuity of PbS NC
SL membranes. Samples were prepared by transferring the silicon nitride
20 nm floating membrane TEM windows (Molecular Foundry). TEM images
were obtained using a JEOL 2100-F 200 kV field-emission analytical
transmission electron microscope operating at an acceleration voltage
of 120 kV.

Ligand Exchange
The chemical activation
process involves
treatment of the films with a 1.0 M solution of hydrazine in ACN for
2–5 h and subsequent washing with ACN.

Charge-Transport
Characterization
SiO2/Si
(100 nm thick oxide layer) substrates were extensively rinsed with
acetone and isopropanol. Then, 5/50 nm deposition was also performed
on p-type silicon (back surface) for the gate contact using a shadow
mask. The width (W) and length (L) of the channels were 1 mm and 100 μm, respectively. The gate
contact was obtained by stretching the SiO2. Multiple source
and drain electrodes were patterned onto a single substrate to allow
for electrical measurements using various channel lengths (100 μm).

Drying-mediated self-assembly for SLs and spin-coating deposition
for TF of the NC solution were performed on the FET devices.

FET measurements were performed in a glovebox with a homemade probe
station using an Agilent 4156B semiconductor parameter analyzer driven
by LabVIEW software. The source electrode was grounded. All RT electrical
measurements were performed under dry nitrogen atmosphere and in the
dark. The electrical properties of PbS SL and PbS glassy thin-film-based
transistors were evaluated by a probe station inside a nitrogen glovebox
(transistor configuration). The source–drain current (IDS) versus source–drain voltage (VDS) curves under different gate voltages (VG) of PbS SL-FET and PbS glassy thin-film FET
were measured using an Agilent precision semiconductor parameter analyzer.

The source–drain current (IDS) versus gate voltage (VGS) curves biased
at a fixed source–drain voltage (VDS) of PbS SL-FET and PbS glassy thin-film FET are measured by a 6487
Picoammeter/Voltage Source (Keithley Instruments), which is used to
contemporarily set the voltage (VDS) at
−20 V and measure the current (IDS) between the drain and source terminals at different VGS values. A 2400 Source Meter Unit (Keithley Instruments)
is used to set the voltage (VGS) at different
values. The gate voltage sweep rate was kept constant at 1 V/s throughout
the measurement.

The measurement system is PC-controlled using
a LabView interface
designed to guarantee the correct timing among the different equipment
used.
