In this article, the polyaniline
(PANI)/thermal-exfoliated hexagonal
boron nitride (BNO) hierarchical structure (PANI–BNO) was constructed
via in situ deposition to improve the dispersion and interfacial adhesion
of boron nitride in multi-aromatic polystyrene (PS) and polar thermoplastic
polyurethane (TPU). Because of the conjugated structure and polar
groups in PANI, the uniform dispersion and strong interfacial adhesion
between PANI–BNO and PS and TPU were achieved. Thermogravimetric
analysis results showed that the incorporation of PANI–BNO
enhanced the thermal stability of PS and TPU, i.e., the temperatures
at both 5 and 50 wt % mass loss. In addition, PANI with high charring
ability also acted as a critical component to generate a synergistic
effect with BNO on reducing the fire hazards of PS and TPU. This well-designed
structure led to a remarkable reduction of flammable decomposed products
and CO and CO2 yields. Meanwhile, a dramatic decrease in
the real-time smoke density and total smoke production was observed
for PS and TPU nanocomposites with 3 wt % PANI–BNO hybrids,
respectively. The multiple synergistic effects (synergistic dispersion,
char formation, and barrier effect) are believed to be the primary
source for these enhanced properties of polymer nanocomposites.

1 Introduction
Polymer nanocomposites reinforced by two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials
are highly attractive because of their enhanced comprehensive performances,
such as thermal,1−3 mechanical,4,5 and electrical properties,6 as well as fire safety.7−10 Recently, there has been an increasing
interest in graphene-like 2D nanomaterials, i.e., hexagonal boron
nitride (HBN), because of its unique structure and outstanding properties,
such as excellent mechanical properties, thermal conductivity, and
electrical insulation, as well as superb oxidation resistance.11−14 With these extraordinary characteristics, HBN is regarded as a promising
nanoadditive to fabricate high-performance polymer nanocomposites.
Owing to the barrier effect and catalytic action, 2D HBN has been
demonstrated as a promising flame retardant and smoke suppressant
for polymer materials.13,15,16 However, the application of HBN in polymer nanocomposites is usually
limited by difficult delamination and poor dispersion of HBN in the
polymer matrix due to the strong layered interaction in bulk HBN.
Therefore, it is necessary to explore an effective approach to achieve
exfoliation and functionalization of HBN. Liquid exfoliation is widely
used to produce HBN nanosheets in scalable quantities.17,18 Unfortunately, the obtained bare HBN nanosheets are easy to restack
and incompatible with the polymer matrix, thus, the desirable reinforcing
effect is hardly achieved by directly introducing the stacked HBN
into the polymer matrix. Recently, Cui et al.19 reported large-scale thermal exfoliation and functionalization of
HBN via a simple thermal oxidation process. After thermal treatment,
there are many hydroxyl groups on the surface and edges of functionalized
HBN (BNO) which is hydrophilic, resulting in superior dispersion of
BNO in water. Such process provides a simple approach to exfoliate
and functionalize HBN for applications in polymer nanocomposites.

HBN–polymer nanocomposites have been extensively developed
in terms of enhanced thermal conductivity, thermal stability, and
mechanical properties. However, up to now, only a few efforts have
been made to fabricate well-dispersible 2D HBN nanomaterials in polymers
with outstanding flame-retarded properties. Gu et al.16 first incorporated a novel hybridized multifunctional filler
(CPBN), cyclotriphosphazene/HBN hybrid (CPBN) functionalized with
hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene and p-phenylenediamine
into bismaleimide/o,o′-diallylbisphenol
A resins, achieving superior thermal conductivity, thermal stability,
and flame retardancy. In spite of the improved properties, the CPBN
is not well exfoliated in solvents, which is not an ideal enhancer
due to the poor dispersion. In our previous work, thermal-exfoliated
HBN was synthesized by thermal treatment, accompanying a subsequent
sol–gel process to enhance fire safety of epoxy resin (EP).13 Although the thermal stability, flame retardancy,
and smoke suppression of the EP nanocomposites were significantly
improved, the procedure was complicated. More importantly, such an
approach is not suitable to prepare flame retarding thermoplastic
materials. More recently, ordered alignment of super paramagnetic
zinc ferrite (ZF) decorated boron nitride nanosheet (ZF–BNNS)
in the EP matrix was achieved when exposed to a weak magnetic field.20 The well-ordered ZF–BNNS nanoadditive
remarkably reduced the peak of heat release rate (PHRR) (48.5%), peak
smoke production release (46.0%), and carbon monoxide production (66.6%),
respectively. The well-aligned BNNS functions as a physical barrier
to slow down the release of gaseous pyrolysis products via the so-called
“tortuous path” effect, while ZF increases the synergistic
effect by promoting carbonization and char layer formation. Despite
the progress in HBN-based flame retardant polymer nanocomposites,
manipulating the surface properties of HBN with suitable modifiers
which can form strong interfacial adhesive with most polymers is still
necessary for general polymeric materials.

Polyaniline (PANI)
with a conjugated structure has been used as
a flame retardant additive for polymers due to its char formation
ability.21,22 Guo et al.23,24 demonstrated
that PANI could serve as a coupling agent to improve the dispersion
state of nanoadditives within the epoxy matrix as well as enhance
the interfacial adhesion by forming covalent bonding between PANI
and epoxy chains. In previous work, mechanically tough PANI–BNNTs
films were obtained through the strong PANI–boron nitride nanotube
(BNNT) interaction.25 Recently, the construction
of PANI/2D nanomaterial hybrids, such as PANI/graphene26 and PANI/MoS2,27,28 has been reported, whereas most of the efforts have been focused
on the electrical properties and catalysis performances of these hybrids.
Because of the conjugated structure and adjustable morphology, it
was speculated that PANI could directly deposit on BNO nanosheets
to promote the dispersion state of hybrid sheets and strengthen the
interface adhesion from PANI to general polymers, such as multi-aromatic
polystyrene (PS) and polar thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU). However,
to the best of our knowledge, the surface manipulation of HBN and
the synergistic effect of PANI–BNO hybrids upon reducing the
fire hazards of polymer nanocomposites have not been reported yet.

In this work, we presented a facile strategy for in situ preparation
of PANI–BNO hybrid sheets by the heterogeneous polymerization
process, where thermal-exfoliated HBN (BNO) was prepared according
to our reported method.13 Benefiting from
the high specific area, BNO nanosheets could act as a template to
induce the growth of PANI. The thermal properties and flame retardancy
of both TPU and PS nanocomposites were investigated and the possible
flame retarding mechanism was proposed.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Structure and Thermal Analysis
of HBN and
its Derivatives
The chemical composition on the surface of
HBN, BNO, and PANI–BNO was investigated by X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) (Figure 1a). Four peaks at approximately 397.5, 190.3, 284.2, and 532.8
eV corresponding to N 1s, B 1s, C 1s, and O 1s, respectively, are
observed in the XPS spectrum of HBN. The XPS spectrum of BNO is similar
to that of HBN, while the elemental contents are different (see Table S1, Supporting Information). Obviously,
the oxygen atom percentage for BNO (7.5%) is much higher than that
of HBN (2.2%), due to the presence of hydroxyl groups on the surface
of BNO. Noticeably, the carbon atom content of PANI–BNO is
much higher than that of BNO due to the incorporation of carbon-rich
PANI (49.2% for PANI–BNO vs 7.1% for BNO). Figure 1b shows the X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns of HBN, BNO, and PANI–BNO. Typical peaks at
26.6, 41.7, 44.0, 50.2, 55.1, and 76.0° are indexed as (0 0 2),
(1 0 0), (1 0 1), (1 0 2), (0 0 4), and (1 1 0) planes of HBN, respectively.16 Compared to HBN, BNO exhibits a new peak at
27.9°, resulting from B(OH)3 (010),29 further confirming the formation of hydroxyl groups. Different
from BNO, the characteristic (0 1 1), (0 2 0), and (2 0 0) crystal
planes of polyaniline (PANI) appear in the XRD pattern of PANI–BNO.30 Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy
was employed to further confirm the structures of HBN, BNO, and PANI–BNO.
The FTIR spectrum of HBN reveals two strong absorptions at 1370 and
815 cm–1 corresponding to the B–N stretching
and deformation vibrations, respectively. By hydroxylation, a new
peak at 3210 cm–1 ascribed to O–H stretching
vibrations appears. For the FTIR spectrum of PANI–BNO, the
intense peaks at 1581 and 1130 cm–1 can be correlated
to the quinoid structure of PANI. The peak at 1497 cm–1 is attributed to benzenoid rings. The peak at 1291 cm–1 is due to the C–N stretching of secondary aromatic amines.31−33 The thermal stability of HBN, BNO, and PANI–BNO was investigated
by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Figure 1d). HBN is highly thermally stable with little
weight loss until 700 °C. By contrast, BNO begins to lose weight
at low temperature i.e., 200 °C, resulting from the removal of
unstable hydroxyl groups at the surface, while 94.4 wt % residue is
left at 700 °C. After the growth of PANI on BNO, PANI–BNO
undergoes two-stage degradation, corresponding to the PANI. At 700
°C, the weight residue is approximately 66.6 wt %. On the basis
of the results and discussion aforementioned, it can be concluded
that the hierarchical PANI/BNO hybrids have been successfully prepared.

spectra, (b) XRD patterns, (c) FTIR spectra, and (d) TGA
curves of HBN, BNO, and PANI–BNO.

2.2 Morphology and Dispersion
Both scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
were employed to observe the morphology of HBN, BNO, and PANI–BNO. Figure 2a shows the thick
layered structure of bulk HBN with micro-dimension, and the surface
and edge of HBN are very smooth. After thermal treatment and exfoliation,
large amounts of very thin BNO sheets are observed (Figure 2b). Compared to BNO, the edges
of PANI–BNO nanosheets (Figure 2c) become much rougher and some particles are distributed
on the surface of the nanosheets. Similar results are further verified
by TEM. Bulk stackable sheets, ultra-thin nanosheets, and rough and
particle-loaded nanosheets are respectively demonstrated for HBN,
BNO, and PANI–BNO. These results indicate that the surface
of BNO has been functionalized with PANI via in situ polymerization.
The dispersion and interfacial interaction of PANI–BNO within
polymeric materials are critical to fabricate advanced flame retarding
nanocomposites. Figure 2g–j show TEM images of BNO/PS, PANI–BNO/PS, BNO/TPU,
and PANI–BNO/TPU, respectively. Figure 2h reveals the uniform dispersion of PANI–BNO
in PS with the formation of exfoliated and intercalated structures.
PS is a nonpolar polymer with aromatic-rich structures. Thus, such
excellent dispersion is due to the strong adhesive of PANI to PS caused
by the π–π interaction. Conversely, BNO nanosheets
could not achieve ideal distribution within the PS matrix while some
agglomerations are observed. For TPU/PANI–BNO nanocomposites,
PANI–BNO sheets with mainly exfoliated structures are dispersed
in the matrix. Through thermal exfoliation and subsequent functionalization
with PANI, the surface of PANI–BNO is polar, which is beneficial
to the dispersion of nanosheets in the polar TPU matrix by electrostatic
interaction. Therefore, PANI–BNO with polar groups and rich
aromatic structures improves the compatibility and interfacial interaction
of HBN within both polar and nonpolar matrices by preventing the restacking
and agglomeration.

2.3 Thermal
Stability of Polymer Nanocomposites
Thermal degradation behavior
of polymer materials is closely related
to their combustion performance. TGA have been widely employed to
investigate thermal degradation behavior of polymer materials.34−36 The thermal stability and degradation behaviors of PS, TPU and their
corresponding nanocomposites were evaluated by TGA, and the detailed
data are listed in Table 1. T0.05 and T0.5 are defined as the temperatures at 5 and 50% weight
loss, respectively. Neat PS undergoes one-stage thermal decomposition
with nothing left at 700 °C under nitrogen, and the T0.05 and T0.5 is 397 and 430
°C, respectively. Both PS/BNO and PS/PANI–BNO show similar
degradation behavior to neat PS, but the thermal stability of PS/PANI–BNO
is higher than the other two samples, demonstrated by the higher T0.05 and T0.5. The
improved thermal stability is further verified by the increased residue
at 700 °C (1.8 vs 0.0 wt %). Noticeably, the only small amount
of residue is obtained for PS/BNO (0.1 wt %), indicative of the heterogeneous
dispersion of BNO in PS. For the thermal-oxidative degradation of
PS and its nanocomposites, all the PS samples exhibit lower degradation
temperature compared to these counterparts under nitrogen, but a higher
increase in T0.05 and T0.5 are observed with the incorporation of PANI–BNO,
which exhibit 14 and 19 °C improvement relative to neat PS, respectively.
As expected, PS/PANI–BNO shows better thermal stability than
PS/BNO. The so-called tortuous path effect of nanosheets, delaying
the escape of volatile degradation products, and the formation of
additional char residues are the main reasons for the enhanced thermal
stability. Different from the thermal stability change, the addition
of BNO or PANI–BNO has a negligible impact on the degradation
rate of PS under nitrogen (See Figure S1, Supporting Information), and even adverse impact on the mass loss
rate under air. This phenomenon is probably attributed to the catalytic
activity of HBN. However, the degradation rate of PS/PANI–BNO
under air is lower than that of PS/BNO, indicating the better barrier
effect of nanosheets. Similar to PS and its nanocomposites, the presence
of nanoadditives does not change the degradation pathway of TPU, while
there are also increases in the T0.05 and T0.5 under nitrogen. By contrast, adding PANI–BNO
promotes the char formation of TPU from 2.9 wt % for neat TPU to 6.0
wt % (nitrogen), indicating that PANI–BNO is a more significant
charring effect in TPU than PS, which may cause larger reduction in
the total heat release. It is noteworthy that the residues of TPU
nanocomposites against thermal oxidation over 450 °C is improved,
suggesting the superior thermal stability at elevated temperatures.
Interestingly, both PANI–BNO and BNO reduce the degradation
rate of the corresponding TPU nanocomposites, and PANI–BNO
contributes to a larger reduction than BNO resulting from the ideal
dispersion. This result is indicative of the main contribution of
the barrier activity of BNO over the catalytic effect. Overall, the
TGA results demonstrate that PANI–BNO improves the thermal
stability and promotes the charring of polymer substrates, especially
TPU.

2.4 Combustion Performance
of Polymer Nanocomposites
Cone calorimeter (CC) has been
demonstrated to provide data that
correlate well with medium to full-scale fire tests.37−40 The combustion performance of pristine polymers and their nanocomposites
was evaluated by cone calorimeter, as shown in Figures 3 and4, and the corresponding
parameters are summarized in Table 2. Pristine PS is flammable and releases large amounts
of heat with the peak of heat release rate (PHRR) of 896 kW/m2 once ignited. Compared to pure PS, PS/BNO shows notable flame
retardancy, corresponding to a 28.9% reduction in the PHRR with much
lower time to ignition (TTI), probably due to the high thermal conductivity
and catalytic effect of BNO. The barrier effect of the BNO nanosheets
is responsible for the increased full width at half maximum for the
HRR curves of PS/BNO nanocomposites, which is confirmed by the negligible
change of total heat release (THR) values (Figure 4c). A higher reduction in the PHRR (31.3%)
relative to PS/BNO is observed for PS/PANI–BNO, suggesting
the lower fire hazards. The reduction is attributed to the fact that
the barrier effect will prolong the release of combustible gases derived
from PS, but the total heat release is not reduced. By contrast, the
PHRR of TPU/PANI–BNO is decreased by 32.6% relative to neat
TPU (Figure 4b). Noticeably,
a decrease of 8.9% in THR is observed, indicating that PANI–BNO
is more efficient on promoting the char formation of TPU than PS,
as revealed by TGA results.

Fire hazards of polymeric materials are usually composed
of thermal
hazards and nonthermal hazards. Smoke and toxic gases belong to the
nonthermal hazards, which are mainly responsible for fire deaths.41,42 Therefore, reducing smoke and toxic gases release polymeric materials
during a fire are of vital importance for rescue. Figure 5 plots the SPR and TSP curves
of PS and its nanocomposites (a, c), and TPU and its nanocomposites
(b, d). The pSPR, TSP, pCOP, and pCO2P values for polymer
nanocomposites follow the reduction change trend similar to the PHRR
(Figures S2 and S3, Supporting Information).
The additional char formation and barrier effect of PANI–BNO
leads to the reduction of total smoke release, while the presence
of PANI–BNO has little effect on the CO production, implying
the incomplete combustion. All these reductions in smoking and toxic
gases are attributed to multiple synergistic catalytic and barrier
action of PANI–BNO.

and TPU and its nanocomposites (b, d).

2.5 Flame Retardant Mechanism
To well
understand the flame retardant mechanism, residue analysis of samples
after combustion are very crucial. Figure 6 shows the digital photos of char residues
for all samples after cone calorimeter tests. Neat PS (Figure 6a) has no residue left, while
both PS/BNO and PS/PANI–BNO (Figure 6b) produces a little char due to the presence
of temperature-tolerant HBN. Because of the intumescent characters
of TPU during burning, all the TPU samples (Figure 6d–f) have large amounts of residues,
which are not much different from each other. To further analyze the
quality of these residues, FTIR and XRD were used to investigate their
components and structures. Figure 6 presents FTIR spectra (g) and XRD patterns (h) of
these char residues for PS/PANI–BNO, TPU, and its nanocomposites
after cone calorimeter tests. The FTIR spectra of the char residues
for PS/PANI–BNO, TPU/BNO, and TPU/PANI–BNO reveal the
peaks at approximately 750 cm–1 due to multi-aromatic
structure. Different from the char structure of TPU, PS/PANI–BNO,
TPU/BNO, and TPU/PANI–BNO exhibit absorption peaks at 1375
and 815 cm–1 due to the vibration of B–N,
indicating the presence of HBN. In the XRD pattern of the residue
for pure TPU, a weak and broad diffraction peak at approximately 23°
is attributed to (002) diffraction of graphite.13 These XRD patterns of PS/PANI–BNO, TPU/BNO, and
TPU/PANI–BNO reveal the diffraction peaks for (0 0 2), (1 0
0), (1 0 1), (1 0 2), (0 0 4), and (1 1 0) planes of HBN, respectively.43 Hence, the char layer composed of multi-aromatic
carbon and temperature-tolerant HBN functions as an effective barrier
to retard mass and heat transfer.

TG-IR was used for the real-time detection of the evolved
volatile
products of PS and its nanocomposites during the thermal degradation
process. The FTIR spectra of the volatile pyrolysis products emitted
from PS, PS/BNO, and PS/PANI–BNO at the maximum degradation
rate are plotted in Figure 7. According to the previous report, the pyrolysis products
of PS are identified by the appearance of absorptions at 3073 and
3032 cm–1 (unsaturated C–H stretching vibration),
2940 cm–1 (saturated C–H stretching vibration),
1600 and 1496 cm–1 (C=C stretching vibration),
and 771 and 697 cm–1 (C–H deformation vibration).44,45 The similar degradation products of PS/BNO and PS/PANI–BNO
nanocomposites are observed from the FTIR spectra. In addition, the
presence of BNO and PANI–BNO delays the degradation of the
PS substrate, which is consistent with the TGA analysis under nitrogen.

Figure 7 FTIR spectra
of volatile pyrolysis products emitted from PS, PS/BNO,
and PS/PANI–BNO at a maximum degradation rate.

The formation of char by physical or chemical action
is affected
by the addition of 2D nanosheets. Because of the chemical inertness
of HBN, it mainly functions in physical modes, while the PANI on the
surface plays its role in chemical modes by both self-charring and
reacting with the char from PS or TPU. The proposed flame-retarded
mechanisms are illustrated in Figure 8. As clearly demonstrated in the sections above, HBN
nanosheets can improve the thermal stability of the char. For intumescent
char layers, i.e., TPU, high specific surface area and thermal stability
of PANI–BNO nanosheets are responsible for the increase in
the barrier effect and mechanical properties of the formed char. Superior
barrier performance of HBN can also retard the release of combustible
decomposition products and limit the supply of fuel and oxygen. Moreover,
the catalytic action of HBN leads to the reduction of the smoke and
CO release, as seen from the cone calorimeter results. PANI on the
surface not only improves the dispersion of BNO by non-covalent interaction
with the polymer matrix reaching an ideal barrier effect of nanosheets,
but also reacts with char residues from polymer substrates under high
temperature to improve char quality, which further reinforces the
barrier effect of char layers.

for polymer/PANI–BNO
nanocomposites.

2.6 Comparison
on Thermal Stability and Flame
Retardancy
To highlight the large progress achieved by this
strategy, the comparison of flame retardancy of PS, TPU, and their
2D nanomaterial-based nanocomposites in this work to the results reported
in the previous literature is summarized in Table 3. MCC refers to the micro-combustion calorimeter,
which was used to investigate polymer combustion at a small scale
(5–10 mg). Zhou et al.46 revealed
that pristine graphene nanosheets (GNS) or MoS2 exhibited
a small reduction in the PHRR. Cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB)-modified
MoS2 caused serious deterioration of the thermal properties
of PS.47 Bao et al.48 improved flame retarding efficiency of graphene oxide (GO)
by grafting phosphazene units, but the thermal stability was reduced.
More importantly, GO is much more expensive than HBN, accompanying
a large amount of pollutant output in the preparation process. Other
2D nanomaterials, such as organic-modified layered zirconium phosphate
(OZrP, Zhang et al.49), layered zirconium
phosphate (Tai et al.50), and layered double
hydroxide (Matusinovic et al.51) were also
not effective to reduce the PHRR, but simultaneously lower the thermal
stability of the polymer matrix. For flame-retarded TPU nanocomposites,
Shi et al.52 reported a large reduction
in the PHRR (37%) with improved thermal stability (16.1 °C increment
in T0.1) by using CuCo2O4-loaded graphitic carbon nitride (C-CuCo2O4-7). However, other loading of CuCo2O4 on g-C3N4 had an adverse effect on the thermal
stability, thus, it was very difficult to control the loading to achieve
ideal flame-retarded TPU nanocomposites with improved thermal stability.
Obviously, graphite nanosheets (GNPs, Quan et al.53), Co3O4–GNS (Zhou et al.54), and montmorillonite (MMT, Cai et al.55) are not effective enough to reduce the PHRR.
Although ultra-thin β-Co(OH)2 nanosheets56 were demonstrated to be an efficient nanoadditive
to improve the fire safety of TPU, the greatly reduced thermal properties
of the TPU matrix was not suitable for practical applications. Herein,
both thermal stability and fire safety of PS- and TPU-based nanocomposites
are considerably improved when the PANI–BNO is added into PS
and TPU. Because the surface of BNO is manipulated with PANI via in
situ deposition, and PANI–BNO forms non-covalent bonds to PS
or TPU, PANI–BNO is reasonably believed to be well dispersed
in these polymer materials. Therefore, the excellent dispersion of
PANI–BNO, and synergistic flame retardancy between BNO and
PANI result in the high fire safety and thermal stability of PS and
TPU nanocomposites.

3 Conclusions
The
surface of thermal-exfoliated hexagonal boron nitride was facilely
manipulated by in situ depositing PANI, which was compatible with
multi-aromatic PS and polar TPU. Through the combination of PANI and
BNO preventing their aggregation while maintaining the layer-like
structure, the superior dispersion of PANI–BNO in polymeric
materials were achieved. Benefiting from the uniform dispersion of
nanosheets with an ideal barrier effect, the thermal stability of
PS and TPU nanocomposites (T0.05, T0.5 and char residue) was improved, which was
much better than other reported 2D nanomaterial-based reinforced polymers.
Incorporating 3 wt % PANI–BNO hybrid showed an obvious suppression
effect on fire hazards of PS and TPU in terms of the reduced PHRR
and low smoke yield. These obvious improvements resulted from the
multiple synergistic effects (synergistic dispersion, char formation,
catalytic effect, and barrier effect) of PANI–BNO hybrids within
polymer nanocomposites. Such a simple strategy will be promising for
2D nanomaterial functionalization with potential application in flame
retarding general polymeric materials.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Raw Materials
PS was obtained from
BASF-YPC Co., Ltd. (China). TPU was obtained from Baoding Bangtai
Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. (Baoding, China). HBN powder with a purity
of 99.9% was obtained from Shandong Mingyao new materials Co. Ltd.
(Shandong, China). N,N-dimethylformamide
(DMF, AP) (DMF, AR), absolute ethanol (AR), sodium dodecyl sulfonate
(SDS), and aniline were all purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent
Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China).

4.2 Preparation of PANI–BNO
BNO
was prepared according to the method described in our prior work.13 The PANI–BNO hybrid was prepared by in
situ polymerization, using SDS as the surfactant. More specifically,
0.3 g of BNO was dispersed in 500 mL of deionized (DI) water assisted
with ultrasonic treatment for 2 h. Subsequently, 0.5 g of SDS and
0.9 g of aniline were introduced into the above suspension and the
reaction system was kept at room temperature for 24 h. After completion
of the reaction, the suspension formed was centrifuged, washed, and
dried, and the PANI–BNO hybrid was collected. The preparation
process of PANI–BNO hybrids are illustrated in Scheme 1a.

the Preparation Process of (a) PANI–BNO Hybrids
and (b) Polymer/PANI–BNO Nanocomposites
4.3 Preparation of PANI–BNO/Polymer
Nanocomposites
PANI–BNO/polymer nanocomposites were
fabricated by a co-coagulation
plus compression molding technique, as shown in Scheme 1b. The loading of nanoadditive for all the
nanocomposites was kept at 3 wt %. Prior to manufacturing, PS and
TPU were dried in an oven at 80 °C, for 24 h to remove residual
water. Briefly, the preparation of PANI–BNO/polymer nanocomposites
was described as follows. 1.5 g of PANI–BNO was dispersed in
200 mL of DMF with sonication for 1 h. Subsequently, 48.5 g of PS
or TPU pre-dissolved in DMF was introduced into PANI–BNO dispersion
until the formation of uniform dispersion. Finally, the above solution
was poured into DI water accompanying slight magnetic stirring. The
flocculate obtained was dried in an oven at 100 °C for 12 h to
remove the residual solvent. The sample was hot-pressed at 180 °C
and 10 MPa for 10 min into sheets of appropriate size.

4.4 Characterization
Chemical structures
of samples were studied by Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy
using a Nicolet 6700 spectrophotometer (Nicolet Instrument Co.). X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to investigate the surface
chemical composition of samples using a VG Escalab Mark II spectrometer
equipped with an Al Kα excitation radiation (hυ = 1486.6 eV). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of samples
were recorded on an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Co., Japan) with
Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.1542 nm). Morphology and dispersion
of samples was observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM)
and a transmission electron microscope (TEM). SEM images were acquired
from a FEI Sirion 200 scanning electron microscope at an acceleration
voltage of 10 kV. TEM was evaluated on a JEOL JEM-2100 instrument
with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. Prior to observation, power
samples were dispersed in DI water assisted with ultrasonic treatment
and solid samples with dozens of microns in thickness were obtained
using an ultramicrotome. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted
on a TGA Q5000IR thermo-analyzer (TA Instruments Inc.) at a heating
rate of 20 °C/min. Combustion performance of samples was evaluated
using a cone calorimeter (Fire Testing Technology, UK) under an incident
flux of 35 kW/m2. All the samples with the dimensions of
100 × 100 × 3 mm3 are required for the tests.
Thermogravimetric analysis-infrared spectrometry (TG-IR) was performed
using a PerkinElmer TGA analyzer coupled with a Fourier transform
infrared spectrophotometer at a heating rate of 20 °C/min under
nitrogen. The temperature between stainless steel transfer pipe and
gas cell were maintained at 230 °C to avoid the condensation
of pyrolysis products. Raman spectroscopy was performed using a LabRAM-HR
Confocal Raman Microprobe (Jobin Yvon Instruments, France) with a
514.5 nm argon ion laser.
