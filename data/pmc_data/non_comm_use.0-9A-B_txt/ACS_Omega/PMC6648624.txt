Tetrathiafulvalene vinylogues (TTFVs)
functionalized with diaryl
substituents (aryl = 1-napthyl, 9-anthryl, and 1-pyrenyl) via click
chemistry have been previously synthesized and studied as tweezer-type
receptors for binding with C60 and C70 fullerenes.
In particular, dianthryl-TTFV exhibits unique selectivity for C70 fullerene, giving rise to effective fluorescence turn-on
sensing of C70 in the presence of a large excess of C60 fullerene. This observation indicated that dianthryl-TTFV
has a preferential binding affinity for C70 over C60 fullerene, but the reason for such selectivity is unclear.
Aiming at addressing this issue, we herein investigated the relative
conformational stability of diaryl-substituted TTFVs in complexation
with C70 and C60 fullerenes. The dispersion-corrected
density functional theory approximation (B3LYP-D3) was employed in
our computational analysis to determine binding energies and electronic
properties of these supramolecular complexes. It was found that the
highest binding energies (and the lowest relative conformational energies)
are in pairings when fullerenes are placed around the central TTFV
moieties (such as the triazole rings). The results of electronic properties
show that the dianthryl-TTFV and dipyrenyl-TTFV conformers have lower
highest occupied molecular orbital–lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital gaps relative to the ones obtained for dinaphthyl-TTFV, indicating
that dianthryl-TTFV, and to some extend dipyrenyl-TTFV, could be good
candidates for chemical sensing of fullerenes with fluorescence spectroscopy.
We also investigated the effect of the solvent on the interactions
of the diaryl-TTFVs with fullerenes using the polarizable continuum
model. In general, the presence of a solvent decreases the diaryl-TTFV/fullerene
binding energies, presumably because of the interactions of the solvent
with individual fullerenes and diaryl-TTFVs.

1 Introduction
Since
the discovery of buckminsterfullerene C60 by Kroto,
Curl, and Smalley in 1985,1 fullerenes
and fullerene-containing materials have stimulated tremendous scientific
interest.2−9 The most stable and abundant fullerenes prepared by usual methods
such as the Kratschmer–Huffman arc discharge technique are
C60 and C70 fullerenes.2,7 Higher
fullerenes are also accessible, including C74, C76, C78, C80, C82, and C84, but their preparation and isolation are more challenging.2 The design and synthesis of selective molecules
that have the ability to detect and separate fullerenes have been
receiving great attention in the field of supramolecular chemistry.8−14 Efficient separation and purification of different types of fullerenes
can be achieved by the host–guest complexation of fullerenes
(guests) with proper receptor molecules (hosts).8 In 1994, both Atwood et al.8 and Shinkai et al.10 succeeded in preparing
the first two different calixarene-based fullerene receptors to separate
C60 from carbon soot with purity of 99.5 and 99.8%, respectively.
Since then, much research efforts have been devoted to the host–guest
chemistry of fullerenes and organic receptors.9,12,15 Of particular note is the development of
tetrathiafulvalene (TTF)-based fullerene receptors, which have been
widely reported in the recent literature. TTF is an excellent organic
π-electron donor, and its π-extended analogues can show
favored binding properties with fullerenes via π-stacking and
charge-transfer interactions. Martín and co-workers designed
a number of fullerene receptors using π-extended TTFs (ex-TTFs)
as the active components to achieve high affinity and selectivity
for fullerenes.16−22 In addition to TTF derivatives, other organic π-conjugated
systems have been successfully applied in making fullerene receptors.
For example, Morin et al. in 2008 developed a rotaxane–porphyrin
conjugate to act as a tweezer-type supramolecular host for fullerenes.23 Sanders and co-workers reported chiral naphthalene
diimide derivatives as selective receptors for C70 fullerene.24 In 2007, Sygula et al. synthesized a corannulene-based
molecular pincer, termed “buckycatcher”, which could
form an inclusion complex with C60 fullerene through concave/convex
π–π interactions.5 The
binding and charge-transfer properties of the buckycatcher/C60 complex were later examined by several groups using computational
analysis.25−29

In 2013, Zhao et al. synthesized a series of tweezer-shaped
molecular
hybrids of diphenyl-substituted TTF vinylogues (TTFVs) functionalized
with three different planar arene end groups (from now on referred
to simply as diaryl-TTFVs) through click chemistry (compounds 1a–c, Figure 1).11 In view of their π-electron-donating
properties and tweezer-like molecular shapes, these diaryl-TTFVs were
designed to act as receptors for C60 and C70 fullerenes. The supramolecular interactions of 1a–c with C60 and C70 fullerenes were investigated
by UV–vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. In terms
of fluorescence responses to fullerenes in chlorobenzene, molecular
tweezers 1a–c showed end group-dependent behaviors:
(i) dinaphthyl-TTFV 1a did not give significant fluorescence
changes upon titration with either C60 or C70, (ii) dianthryl-TTFV 1b showed a slight degree of fluorescence
enhancement upon titration with C60 but a much more significant
fluorescence enhancement upon titration with C70, and (iii)
dipyrenyl-TTFV 1c exhibited prominent fluorescence turn-on
responses to both C60 and C70. Analysis of binding
constants revealed that dianthryl-TTFV 1b has a uniquely
high selectivity toward binding C70 over C60; however, the reason for this has remained unclear.

diaryl-TTFV compounds 1a–c and 2a–c.

In this work, with the help of
density functional theory (DFT)
calculations, we carried out conformational/structural analysis and
investigated the interactions between the three diaryl-TTFVs and fullerenes
with the aim of gaining deeper understanding of the previously reported
experimental results.11 In our computational
studies, three analogous compounds 2a–c, which
bear SMe (for computational expediency) instead of SC10H21 as side chains on the 1,3-dithiole moieties, were
chosen as models to be examined. It has been shown that noncovalent,
intramolecular, and intermolecular interactions must be properly taken
into account when analyzing structures and energetics of supramolecular
complexes.30,31 Post-Hartree–Fock methods
such as MP2 and CCSD(T), which can accurately account for noncovalent
interactions, are impractical and computationally too expensive to
study our large-sized molecular systems.30 On the other hand, dispersion-corrected DFT (D-DFT) methods such
as B97D,32 B3LYP-D3,33 or ωB97XD,34 that also
take into account noncovalent interactions, scale well with molecular
size and have a good computational performance-to-cost ratio. D-DFTs
are therefore the appropriate choice for computational studies on
relatively large supramolecular complexes. In our previous works,35−40 the B3LYP-D3 method was found to give results consistent with experimental
observations and/or trends. This method was hence adopted to perform
all computations in this study.

2 Computational
Details
We have performed all electronic structure computations
in this
work using the Gaussian 16, Revision B.01 software.41 Geometries of all isolated molecules and supramolecular
pairs of diaryl-TTFVs and fullerenes were optimized at the B3LYP-D3/6-31G(d)
level. The B3LYP-D3 method includes the hybrid B3LYP functional plus
the D3 dispersion correction term. B3LYP-D3 accounts for van der Waals
and intermolecular noncovalent interactions as well as for intramolecular
noncovalent interactions.33 The effect
of a solvent (chlorobenzene) on the structures and energetics of isolated
molecules and supramolecular (diaryl-TTFV/fullerene) pairs was investigated
using the polarizable continuum model (PCM).42 We have also calculated the basis set superposition error (BSSE)
using the counterpoise correction method as proposed by Boys and Bernardi.43

We carried out the (B3LYP-D3) conformational
analysis of diaryl-TTFVs
as well as their 1:1 supramolecular complexes with C60 and
C70 fullerenes, respectively. For the complexes, we have
determined the lowest-energy structures by considering strategically
important orientations of fullerenes relative to TTFV molecules. In
order to assess the relative conformational stability of the complexes,
we computed their relative conformational energies defined as the
differences between the energies of the lowest-energy structure and
of other higher energy structures. The binding energy (Eb) for each supramolecular pair was also computed. Eb is defined as 1  where Efullerene, ETTFV, and Epair are the total electronic energies of either
C60 or C70 fullerene, the diaryl-TTFV, and the
diaryl-TTFV/fullerene
pair, respectively. We note that relative conformational and relative
binding energies give the same information; hence, our discussion
will be primarily focused on the analysis of the binding energies.
For single TTFVs, we also determined their distortion energies which
are defined as the energy differences between the energies of the
most (optimized) stable conformers of TTFV and the energies of the
structures they adopt in the complexes [obtained using single-point
(SP) DFT calculations]. In addition to conformational and binding
energies, we also analyzed their electronic structures, in particular,
the trends of frontier molecular orbital energy levels [such as highest
occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital (LUMO) eigenvalues] and their (HOMO–LUMO) differences.

As in our previous work,40 binding energies
per atom (Eb per atom) for all (diaryl-TTFV/fullerene)
combinations were calculated to normalize their total binding energies.
The Eb per atom for each complex is calculated
by dividing the respective total Eb by
the number of interacting atom pairs with one atom being on a fullerene
and the other on a diaryl-TTFV. In each atom pair, the individual
atoms must be separated by less than their respective van der Waals
distances in order for this pair to be considered as interacting.
The van der Waals distances are calculated from the van der Waals
radii determined by Bondi in 1964 as 2.90, 3.40, 3.25, and 3.50
Å for C−H, C−C, C−N, and C−S pairs,
respectively.44 The intermolecular
distances (Δd), between the diaryl-TTFV and
the fullerene in each combination, were also computed by determining
the minimum distances between atoms of the diaryl-TTFV and atoms of
the fullerene. That is, for every atom in the diaryl-TTFV, the minimum
distance was found by calculating all of the Euclidean distances between
this atom and all of the atoms of a given fullerene (using the coordinates
of that atom and coordinates of all atoms of the fullerene) and choosing
the smallest distance. Δd was then taken as
the average of all of the minimum distances for a given diaryl-TTFV.

3 Results and Discussion
The diaryl-TTFV compounds investigated
in this work (2a–c, Figure 1) contain
three different aryl end groups, namely, 1-naphthyl, 9-anthryl, and
1-pyrenyl. They differ from compounds 1a–c, which
were previously synthesized and investigated by Zhao and co-workers,11 only in the sizes of the alkyl chains attached
to the 1,3-dithiole units. Compounds 2a–c contain
only SMe instead of the much larger SC10H12 groups.
The conformational and supramolecular properties of 2a–c should not be much different from those of 1a–c. As aforementioned, the major goal of this work is to theoretically
and computationally rationalize the experimental findings of the supramolecular
interactions between diaryl-TTFVs 1a–c and fullerenes;11 compounds 2a–c are therefore
ideal models to simulate 1a–c with significantly
reduced DFT computational costs. For these diaryl-TTFVs, different
conformational structures are possible in the solution phase. The
single-crystal X-ray structure of dianthryl-TTFV 2b was
previously determined by Zhao et al.,45 which provided valuable insight into its molecular shape and conformational
properties in the solid state. As shown in Figure 2, the two dithiole units in 2b favor a cis-like orientation and the two anthryl end groups point
inwardly to show an edge-to-edge contact.

of dianthryl-TTFV tweezer 2b (CCDC 900616).45 (A) Front view and (B)
side view. Hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity.

The B3LYP-D3/6-31G(d) fully geometry optimized
structures of 2a–c compounds are shown in Figure 3. Very similar optimized
geometries are obtained
without and with a solvent (chlorobenzene) for each of the three molecules.
As can be seen from Figure 3, the structures of the TTFV moieties are very similar to
that observed in the X-ray structure of 2b. One interesting
feature of these diaryl-TTFVs is that the aryl end groups do not adopt
the conformation similar to that shown in the X-ray structure of 2b. These results are not surprising, considering that intermolecular
stacking plays a significant role in the solid-state packing, which
in turn affect the molecular conformation, particularly the orientation
of the end groups. In our geometry optimization, we only considered
individual molecules and the intramolecular π-stacking among
the aryl end groups, hence dictates the favored molecular conformation.
As an example, the energies required to convert their lowest-state
geometries (shown in Figure 3) into their less-stable tweezer-like geometries (shown in Figure 4b) are 0.48 eV (2a), 0.40 ev (2b), and 0.82 eV (2c) without a solvent and 0.42 eV (2a), 0.39 eV (2b), and 0.79 eV (2c) with chlorobenzene when
interacting with C60 fullerene (see Table S1 in the Supporting Information). Table S1 shows that the distortion energies are the largest
(greater than 0.4 eV) in all cases for the “middle”
and “middle-2” configurations that involve opening up
of the overlapping planar aryl end groups. These results of distortion
energies reveal that tweezer-like structures are the least favorable
ones for the diaryl-TTFVs.

using the B3LYP-D3/6-31G(d) level in chlorobenzene.

up, and (e) down (similar results are obtained at the PCM/B3LYP-D3/6-31G(d)
level in chlorobenzene).

On the basis of the conformational analysis of single diaryl-TTFVs
as discussed above, five structures for the supramolecular pairs were
considered, each of which consisting of a diaryl-TTFV and a fullerene
(C60 or C70). These combinations differ by the
orientation of the fullerene molecule (right, middle, left, up, and
down) relative to the diaryl-TTFV molecule. The full conformational
analysis should consider numerous (many of them nearly degenerate)
configurations of these supramolecular complexes. The sample of five
used in this work is deemed as representative configurations because
they cover important general locations of the fullerene relative to
the TTFV molecule. In total, we have examined 15 different diaryl-TTFV/fullerene
pairs for each fullerene. The B3LYP-D3/6-31G(d) optimized geometries
of these pairs are shown in Figures 4 and 5 for C60 and
C70 fullerenes, respectively.

and C70 fullerene investigated in this work using the B3LYP-D3/6-31G(d)
method: (a) right, (b) middle, (c) left, (d) up, and (e) down (similar
results are obtained at the PCM/B3LYP-D3/6-31G(d) level in chlorobenzene).

In view of the fact that C70 fullerene has an oblong
nonspherical shape, an additional structure for each of diaryl-TTFV/fullerene
pairs was investigated when C70 is in the middle of the
diaryl-TTFV tweezer. This conformer is designated as “middle-2”
(see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information for the optimized geometries of “middle-2” conformers).
The “middle” and “middle-2” conformers
differ by the relative orientation of C70; in the “middle-2”
conformers, the long-axis of C70 is pointing vertically
upward toward the dithiole rings (see Figure S2 in the Supporting Information), whereas in the “middle”
conformers, the long-axis is rotated 90° relative to its “middle-2”
orientation and points into the page, as shown on Figure S2. As in the case of single diaryl-TTFV molecules,
all chlorobenzene-solvated supramolecular complexes gave optimized
geometries very similar to those computed in vacuo.

The relative
stability of these diaryl-TTFV/fullerene supramolecular
complexes was investigated by computing their binding energies (Eb’s). Figure 6 and Table S2 in the Supporting Information show Eb’s for the various configurations of diaryl-TTFVs with each
of C60 and C70 fullerenes (the relative conformational
energies for the supramolecular pairs of diaryl-TTFV with each of
C60 and C70 fullerenes are shown in Figure S3
and Table S3 in the Supporting Information). It is evident (from Figures 6 and S3) that the lowest Eb values correspond to the least stable supramolecular
complexes and vice versa. Figure 6 shows that the “up” and “down”
orientations are the least stable among all structures with both fullerenes.
Their binding energies are 0.6–1.0 eV lower than those of the
lower-energy states (see Figures 6 and S3). The other three
orientations (“right”, “middle”, and “left”)
have higher binding energies for all supramolecular pairs, and their
energies differ by less than 0.14, 0.01, and 0.37 eV with C60 and less than 0.12, 0.06, and 0.25 eV with C70 for dinaphthyl-
(2a), dianthryl- (2b), and dipyrenyl-TTFV
(2c), respectively. With C70, the most stable
pair is the “right” structure followed by “middle”
and then “left” structures for each of the three diaryl-TTFVs,
with dianthryl-TTFV (2b) being nearly degenerate for
these three configurations. It was found that the “middle-2”
structures are less stable than “middle” structures
by 0.12, 0.13, and 0.07 eV without a solvent and 0.11, 0.12, and 0.06
eV with chlorobenzene for dinaphthyl- (2a), dianthryl-
(2b), and dipyrenyl-TTFV (2c), respectively
(see Table S3 in the Supporting Information). The three pairs of C60 and diaryl-TTFVs have somewhat
different stability orders: (“right” > “left”
> “middle”), (“middle” = “left”
≃ “right”), and (“right” > “middle”
≃ “left”) for dinaphthyl- (2a),
dianthryl- (2b), and dipyrenyl-TTFV (2c),
respectively. Again, the smallest energy difference was observed for
dianthryl-TTFV structures (2b). In most cases, the total
binding energy for the supramolecular pairs is larger for C70 than that for C60. The main conclusion of this energy
analysis is that the “right”, “middle”,
and “left” orientations of diaryl-TTFVs with C60 and C70 fullerenes have very similar values of binding
energies that are higher than those for the “up” and
“down” orientations, indicating that they are considerably
more stable than the “up” and “down” configurations.

Figure 6 Binding
energies (Eb in eV) for the
supramolecular complexes of diaryl-TTFVs with each C60 and
C70 fullerenes obtained at the B3LYP-D3/6-31G(d) level:
(a) without a solvent, (b) with chlorobenzene, and (c) with BSSE correction
(R: right, M: middle, L: left, U: up, and D: down).

More general, these findings indicate that in order
to form stable
diaryl-TTFV/fullerene complexes, the fullerene molecule should be
placed somewhere along the line connecting the “right”
and “left” orientations (including the “middle”
one). The “right” pairs (in which the fullerene molecules
are placed facing away from the nitrogen atoms of triazole rings of
diaryl-TTFVs, see Figure S4 in the Supporting Information) are somewhat more stable and have higher binding
energies than the “left” pairs (in which the fullerenes
are facing toward the nitrogen atoms of triazole rings as shown in Figure S4) for all pairs except the pair of dianthryl-TTFV
(2b) with C60. In general for the most stable
conformational pairs, their order of the stability is as follows:
“right” > “middle” > “left”.
Similar trends with slightly lower binding and relative conformational
energies can be seen in Figures 6 and S3 and Table S3 for the PCM/chlorobenzene results of
all diaryl-TTFV structures. The presence of the solvent (chlorobenzene)
reduces total binding energies by an average of 0.05 eV for most of
the structures compared to those obtained without a solvent (see Figure 6 and Table S2), indicating that the solvent reduces
the interaction between diaryl-TTFVs and fullerenes.

The BSSE-corrected Eb’s for
all diaryl-TTFV/fullerene complexes are shown in Figure 6 and Table S2 in the Supporting Information. The BSSE corrections
lowered the Eb values by 0.13–0.26,
0.37–0.56, and 0.48–0.60 eV for “up and down”,
“right and left”, and “middle and middle-2”
conformers, respectively. With the BSSE corrections, the relative
order of the low-energy states is changed. The Eb’s for the “middle” conformers become
lower than those for “right” and “left”
conformers in all cases as shown in Figure 6, indicating that the “middle”
ones can no longer be considered as the low-energy conformations.
This is consistent with the distortion energy data (see Table S1 in
the Supporting Information), which showed
that relatively large energies are required to convert the geometries
of the diaryl-TTFV molecules from their lowest-state configurations
to the tweezer-like configurations of their “middle”
conformers. The BSSE analysis indicates that the increased overlap
between diaryl-TTFVs and fullerenes in their “middle”
conformations also leads to the largest BSSE correction and hence
changes the relative conformational stability order. This result points
to the fact that during the interactions of a fullerene with a diaryl-TTFV
molecule, the entry of fullerene into the middle of diaryl-TTFV is
not an easy process. Rather, the preferred binding motif is to place
the fullerene outside the diaryl-TTFV around its mid-section.

In order to assess if BSSE corrections penalize to a larger extent
the more compact “middle” structures, thus favoring
even more the formation of complexes outside of TTFVs, we have also
carried out SP B3LYP-D3 calculations with a higher triple-zeta basis
set (see Table S4 in the Supporting Information). As can be seen from these data, the binding energies for these
three structures are similar in all cases, once again showing that
there is no strong preference for the “middle” tweezer-like
structure. Hence, we point out that with or without the BSSE corrections,
our conclusions are pretty much the same, there are a number of stable
structures of the complexes, with the “middle” structure
being one of them (rather than being the only one).

In Table 1, we list
the number of atoms in a given fullerene interacting with the diaryl-TTFV
molecules (which are within the van der Waals distances), average
distances (Δd) between these interacting atoms,
and binding energies per atom (Eb/atom
= Eb/total number of interacting atoms)
for the supramolecular pairs. It is clear from this table that in
the stable structures such as “right” and “left”,
a good fraction of the noncovalent interactions between diaryl-TTFV
molecules and fullerenes involves hydrogen atoms, whereas for “middle”
structures, such as C–C pairings. This fact is also confirmed
by the average (minimal) distances between diaryl-TTFVs and fullerenes;
in the case of “right” and “left” structures,
these distances are of the order 3.0 Å, whereas for the “middle”
structures, these distances are close to 3.3 Å. Given that the
C–H van der Waals contact is 2.9 Å, these distances support
our conclusion that “right” and “left”
structures involve hydrogen atom bonding (in addition to heavy atom
bonding), whereas “middle” does not involve hydrogen
atom bondings. “Up” structures involve noncovalent bonding
between C and S in addition to C–C and possibly C–H
noncovalent interactions. This finding illustrates that even though
the total binding energy of “up” structures is not as
high as that of the “right”, “left”, and
“middle” structures, the Eb/atom is the highest for “up” structure, indicating
that the interaction between C and S is much stronger than that between
C and C, or C and N, or C and H atoms. The “down” structures
involve predominantly hydrogen atom bondings in most cases. This,
combined with the fact the number of atoms involved in these bonding
is relatively small, results in this orientation being either the
least stable or of similar stability as the “up” configuration.
The distance and Eb/atom analyses show
that, even though in some cases their relative conformational energies
and binding energies are nearly the same (e.g., for “right”,
“left”, and “middle” structures of dianthryl-TTFV/fullerene
complexes), different noncovalent bonding forces may be involved in
stabilizing the various structures of diaryl-TTFV/fullerene complexes.

HOMO and LUMO eigenvalues for the interacting dinaphthyl-
(2a), dianthryl- (2b), and dipyrenyl-TTFVs
(2c) and their supramolecular pairs with either C60 or C70 fullerene are displayed in Figures 7–9, respectively (also see Tables S5–S8
in the Supporting Information). We refer
to interacting
diaryl-TTFVs as molecules which have the same geometries as the ones
obtained from the optimization process of diaryl-TTFV/fullerene combinations.
The electronic structures (HOMO, LUMO energies, etc.) of interacting
diaryl-TTFVs are then obtained (after the fullerenes are removed from
the combinations) from SP DFT calculations. As can be seen from Figures 7–9, the HOMO eigenvalues are of the ranges of −5.02
to −4.73 eV without a solvent and −5.17 to −4.74
eV with chlorobenzene for both the (single) interacting diaryl-TTFVs
and the supramolecular pairs. Hence, the presence of either C60 or C70 fullerene does not affect the HOMO eigenvalues
of both the interacting diaryl-TTFVs and the respective combinations.
In the presence of C60 or C70, ranges of LUMO
eigenvalues (absolute values) of the interacting diaryl-TTFVs are
changed from 1.30–1.61 to 2.99–3.38, from 2.01–2.31
to 2.96–3.34, and from 1.66–1.81 to 2.83–3.46
eV without a solvent and from 1.30–1.46 to 3.02–3.26,
from 2.00–2.17 to 3.04–3.25, and from 1.63–1.78
to 2.96–3.27 eV with chlorobenzene for dinaphthyl- (2a), dianthryl- (2b), and dipyrenyl-TTFV (2c), respectively.

The energy differences between
HOMO and LUMO eigenvalues (Eg) for the
(single) interacting diaryl-TTFVs
and their supramolecular pairs with each of C60 and C70 fullerenes were also determined (see Figure 10). The interacting dianthryl-TTFVs (2b) give the lowest Eg values
in a range of 2.40–2.79 eV without a solvent and 2.82–3.06
eV with chlorobenzene followed by 3.06–3.16 eV without a solvent
and 3.30–3.44 eV with chlorobenzene for interacting dipyrenyl-TTFVs
(2c) and 3.20–3.50 eV without a solvent and 3.61–3.81
eV with chlorobenzene for interacting dinaphthyl-TTFVs (2a). These Eg ranges are lowered significantly
by the presence of either C60 or C70 fullerene
to 1.31–2.02 eV without a solvent and 1.71–2.08 eV with
chlorobenzene for all of the diaryl-TTFV/fullerene supramolecular
complexes. Experimental results showed that the diaryl-TTFVs give
relatively weak fluorescence in solution.46 It is also known that increased π-conjugation in organic molecules
typically reduces their HOMO–LUMO gaps and in turn enhances
their fluorescence efficiency. On the basis of their Eg values, individual dinaphthyl-TTFV (2a)
possesses a lower degree of π-conjugation than dianthryl-TTFV
(2b) and it should therefore exhibit relatively weak
fluorescence. This result agrees with the experimental findings of
diaryl-TTFV molecules. In combinations of diaryl-TTFVs with fullerenes,
the HOMO–LUMO gaps are relatively small and become nearly the
same (see Figure 10) for the diaryl-TTFV/fullerene complexes.

Figure 10 LUMO and HOMO energy
gaps (Eg in eV) for: (a) interacting
diaryl-TTFVs (2a–c) and (b) their supramolecular
pairs with C60 or C70 fullerene obtained at
the B3LYP-D3/6-31G(d) level without a solvent (solid line) and with
chlorobenzene (dashed line). The solid and dashed lines are for the
purpose of guiding the eye only.

The reason why the HOMO–LUMO gaps of the diaryl-TTFV/fullerene
complexes are similar in value is that these gaps are effectively
formed from the eigenvalues of LUMOs of fullerenes (which reside over
the whole of the fullerene) and eigenvalues of HOMOs of diaryl-TTFVs
(which reside near the dithiole rings, near the top of the TTFV molecule,
and not close to the functional aryl groups). Similar findings have
been observed in other donor/fullerene systems (e.g., see ref (47)). As an example, the HOMOs
and LUMOs of the “right” conformers of the diaryl-TTFV/fullerene
combinations are shown in Figure 11. These gaps are nearly equal to the energy differences
between the LUMO energies of the acceptor (isolated C60 and C70 fullerenes) and the HOMO energies of the donors
(isolated diaryl-TTFVs in their interacting geometries), ΔϵLA–HD = ϵLUMO(acceptor) – ϵHOMO(donor). The values of ΔϵLA–HD = ϵLUMO(acceptor) – ϵHOMO(donor) are typically indicative of the strength of interactions
(the lower the value, the stronger the interaction). ΔϵLA–HD values for all supramolecular pairs are shown
in Figure S5 in the Supporting Information. This figure shows that the ΔϵLA–HD values are in the range from 1.47 to 1.72 eV for all pairs, which
is very close to the 1.4–2.0 eV values for the HOMO–LUMO
gaps of the diaryl-TTFV/fullerene complexes. This finding indicates
that in supramolecular complexes, the interaction strength between
diaryl-TTFVs and fullerenes is of similar order of magnitude for the
three types of arene functional groups. Figure S5 also shows that these intermolecular interactions decrease
(because their ΔϵLA–HD’s increase)
in the presence of a solvent.

4 Conclusions
In this
work, we employed the B3LYP-D3 method to study the relative
conformational stability and electronic structures of diaryl-substituted
TTFVs in complexation with C70 and C60 fullerenes
(both with and without the solvent). We found that for single (isolated)
diaryl-TTFV molecules, the most stable conformations have the planar
aryl end groups turned inward and consequently do not form open tweezer-like
structures. In fact, the distortion energies are relatively large
(greater than 0.4 eV) when converting a diaryl-TTFV molecule from
its most stable conformer to the open structure. This has consequences
for the diaryl-TTFV/fullerene complexation. For the diaryl-TTFV/fullerene
supramolecular complexes, we found that the highest binding energies
(and the lowest relative conformational energies) were obtained when
fullerenes were placed around the central region of the TTFV moieties.
The electronic structure analysis showed that the dianthryl-TTFV (2b) and dipyrenyl-TTFV (2c) conformers have lower
HOMO–LUMO gaps relative to the ones obtained for dinaphthyl-TTFV
(2a), indicating that dianthryl-TTFV (2b), and to some extend dipyrenyl-TTFV (2c), could be
good candidates for chemical sensing of fullerenes by means of fluorescence
responsiveness. When diaryl-TTFVs are in combinations with fullerenes,
the HOMO–LUMO gaps of the resulting pairs become nearly the
same because they are formed by the HOMOs of the diaryl-TTFVs and
LUMOs of the fullerenes in all cases. The presence of a solvent (chlorobenzene)
decreases the diaryl-TTFV/fullerene binding energies, presumably because
of the interactions of the solvent with individual fullerenes and
diaryl-TTFVs. It is our belief that we must look more closely at the
excitation spectra of diaryl-TTFV/fullerene complexes, for example,
by time-dependent DFT analysis, in order to resolve the mystery as
to why dianthryl-TTFV exhibits unique fluorescence selectivity for
C70 fullerene in the presence of a large excess of C60 fullerene. With this study, we can only conclude that the
interactions of diaryl-TTFVs with fullerenes result in lowering of
HOMO–LUMO gaps. Such changes in electronic structures may be
the major reason for the experimentally observed fluorescence enhancement
when diaryl-TTFVs were in complexation with fullerenes.
