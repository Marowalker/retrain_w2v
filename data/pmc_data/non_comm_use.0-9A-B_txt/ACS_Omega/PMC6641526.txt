Organic–inorganic metal halide
perovskites have attracted
great attention as optoelectronic materials because of their low cost,
relative insensitivity to defects, and solution-processible properties.
However, some of their properties, such as thermal instability, toxicity,
and current–voltage hysteresis still remain elusive. Ion migration,
which has been proven to be a thermal-activated process, is regarded
as one of the major origins of the hysteresis and thus detrimental
to the long-term stability of the optoelectronic devices. Nevertheless,
by using the external electric field to pole the perovskite, ion migration
would be possible to be utilized to create dynamic electronic junctions.
In this paper, electric-field-induced dynamic electronic junctions
have been manipulated for photodetection and energy harvesting through
the ion migration under external electric field. Ion-migration-induced
p–n or n–p junction has been successfully created via
tuning the polarity of the external applied voltage, which is used
for photodetection with a relatively fast response. By freezing out
of the nonuniformly distributed ions after migration at low temperature,
we demonstrate that the ion-migration-induced dynamic junctions can
function as an energy harvesting device with an external quantum efficiency
of 20%.

Introduction
Organic–inorganic metal halide
perovskites have been one
of the most intensively investigated optoelectronic materials with
applications in high-efficiency solar cells because of their low cost,
relative insensitivity to defects, and solution-processible properties.1−13 Starting from 3.8%, a certified power conversion efficiency higher
than 20% has been achieved just within a few years.14 Besides, the rapid progress in material synthesis and device
fabrication as well as the remarkable optical and electronic properties
of perovskites also have promoted the development of other optoelectronic
applications, including lasers,15,16 light-emitting diodes
(LEDs),17−19 transistors,17,20−22 and photodetectors.3,23−26

Despite the great advancement
of perovskite-based optoelectronic
applications, there are still some challenges for their further commercialization,
such as thermal instability,27,28 toxicity,29 and current–voltage hysteresis.17,30−32 In particular, the presence of hysteresis not only
prevents the precise evaluation of power conversion efficiency, but
also leads to the long-term instability of the optoelectronic devices.33,34 Up to date, the origin of hysteresis in perovskites still has not
been fully understood. Understanding the underlying mechanism of hysteresis
is essential to produce high-efficient and long-term stable optoelectronic
devices. Several possible explanations for hysteresis have been proposed,
including slow ion migration, charge trapping–detrapping, and
ferroelectricity, in which ion migration has been regarded as the
most possible factor responsible for the hysteresis at room temperature.35,36 Ion migration has been proven to be a thermal-activated process.30 Therefore, with the decrease of temperature,
the ion migration could be gradually frozen out resulting in the reduction
of hysteresis at low temperature.

By utilizing the electric-field-induced
ion migration, the creation
and manipulation of p–n junctions in perovskite materials have
been reported by a number of groups. Nevertheless, creating the electric-field-induced
dynamic electronic junctions for photodetection and energy harvesting
through ion migration under external electric field and symmetrically
investigating how the dynamic electronic junctions evolve with temperature
have not been fully explored yet. In this paper, we utilize the ion
migration induced by an external electric field to create dynamic
electronic junctions in hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites
for photodetection and energy harvesting. We have successfully created
p–n and n–p junctions in MAPbI3 via reversing
the polarity of the external applied voltage, which has been used
for photodetection with a fast response. Moreover, by freezing out
of the accumulated ions at low temperature after migration, we have
realized the energy harvesting devices with an external quantum efficiency
(EQE) of 20%.

Results and Discussion
The schematic
of a MAPbI3 perovskite microplate device
structure is shown in Figure 1a. Two symmetric 10 nm Cr/100 nm Au electrodes with a channel
length of 20 μm have been adopted. Perovskite microplates on
300 nm SiO2/Si substrate have been obtained by converting
PbI2 microplates, which is dropped onto the substrate,
via vapor transport method. As shown in Figure 1b, ions across the MAPbI3 channel
are evenly distributed without unbalanced ionic charges before the
device is poled by the external electric field. When an external bias
is applied, the positive (I– vacancies) and negative
(MA+ vacancies) ions start to drift to opposite directions
under the applied electric field and accumulate at the interfaces
between perovskite and electrodes, which leads to the formation of
an ion-induced internal electric field (denoted as Eion). The direction of the ion-induced electric field
is opposite to that of the applied external field and thus partially
offsets it, thus resulting in decreasing current.

Figure 1 (a) Schematic of a perovskite
microplate device structure on 300
nm SiO2/Si substrate with 10 nm Cr/100 nm Au as electrodes;
(b) schematic diagrams of ion distribution of the perovskite devices
before (upper panel) and after (bottom panel) poling. Different colors
represent the uneven ion distribution; (c) temporal response curves
after positive and negative biasing at room temperature under illumination;
and (d) output curves of the perovskite device with and without poling
under 1.4 mW/cm2 light.

Figure 1c
shows
the temporal response of current curves of a typical MAPbI3 microplate device after positive (+2 V) and negative (−2
V) bias voltages at room temperature under white light (1.4 mW/cm2) illumination. Completely opposite trends under positive
and negative biases have been observed because of the symmetry of
the electrodes in the device. When the positive bias is applied, the
current jumps to a certain value and decreases gradually to a constant
value, which is due to the generation of the ion-induced electric
field inside perovskites, contradicting the external electric field.
The ion-induced electric field (Eion)
gradually increases and finally reaches a constant value, thus leading
to the gradual decrease in current and finally a constant nonzero
current. Once the bias is removed (after around 220 s), the current
with an opposite sign has been recognized, which decreases to zero
gradually. The observation of currents with opposite directions can
be attributed to the ion-induced electric field, which has an opposite
direction to the external applied field. With time, the accumulated
ions start to diffuse and finally distribute evenly across MAPbI3. Therefore, the opposite-direction current gradually decreases
to zero finally.

The migration of ions can be considered as
dynamic doping, and
thus it is anticipated that dynamic electronic junctions could be
created by controlling the migration of ions under the applied external
electric field.37 The output (I vs V) curves of the devices exhibit dependence
on the history of applied biases (Figure 1d). The I–V curve without poling under white light (1.4 mW/cm2) illumination indicates that the contact between perovskite
and Au is not perfectly Ohmic (or Ohmic-like). After a +4 V poling
field has been applied for 60 s, the device behaves similar to a weak
p–n junction, whereas by switching the poling field from +4
to −4 V, an opposite I–V behavior n–p junction has appeared, suggesting that the rectification
of the I–V relationship is
reversible depending on the polarity of the external poling field.
This indicates that the ion migration induced by the external field
provides an approach to create the dynamic electronic junctions for
optoelectronic applications.

The dynamic junctions created through
the ion migration in MAPbI3 perovskite microplates can
be utilized for photodetection. Figure 2a shows the output
curves of the perovskite device both in dark and under illumination.
There is almost no detectable current under dark at room temperature,
which might be due to the high crystallinity of the perovskite microplates
and thus the lack of intrinsic charge carriers. However, under white
light (1.4 mW/cm2) illumination, a nearly linear I–V behavior has been observed,
similar to the results previously reported.34 A slight hysteresis for the output curve under illumination is observed,
which may mainly be due to the ion migration induced by the external
electric field.

Figure 2 (a) Output curves of the perovskite device in dark and
under illumination;
(b) temporal response curve after 2 V poling at room temperature under
illumination; (c) response speed of the perovskite device under an
external bias of 2 V; and (d) response speed of the device under the
ion migration induced by the external electric field.

To further explore the photodetection properties
of the dynamic
electronic junction, we have measured the temporal response at room
temperature under a 532 nm laser illumination with a power density
of 0.5 mW/cm2 modulated by a mechanical chopper. First,
a positive 2 V biasing was applied to pole the device, and we have
examined the time response after the photocurrent reaches a constant
value when the ion migration reaches the equilibrium condition. As
shown in Figure 2c,
which is taken from Figure 2b (510–517 ms portion), the rising time (defined as
the time for the photocurrent rising from 10 to 90% of the maximum
photocurrent) and the falling time (defined as the time for the photocurrent
falling from 90 to 10% of the maximum photocurrent) are 650 and 780
μs, respectively.3 After removing
the external electric field, the ion-induced electric field still
exists, which causes the device to behave similar to a photodiode,
and thus shows a negative current because the direction of the ion-induced
electric field is opposite to that of the external electric field,
as discussed previously. The photocurrent would decrease gradually
with the diffusion of the ions back to the original uniform distribution
in the perovskite. From the enlarged portion of 570–577 ms
in Figure 2d, the rising
and falling time of the poled device are around 330 and 300 μs,
respectively, which is two times faster than that under the external
electric field. The faster time response of the device after switching
off the external field indicates that the p–n junction is indeed
formed after the device was poled. For a photoconductor, the photogenerated
carriers might circulate inside the circuit for many times, leading
to a higher gain and slower response compared with the photodiode.

As the ion migration is a thermal-activated process, we expect
that the ion migration can be frozen out at low temperature, and thus
we can properly design the cooling process to realize the energy harvesting
devices by using the ion-migration effect. For the first case, the
as-fabricated device was directly cooled down to 77 K so that we can
avoid the influence from ion migration because of the poling effect
at room temperature, which usually cannot completely restore to their
original uniform distribution state within a short time. When temperature
decreased to 77 K, the ion migration is frozen out with uniform distribution,
thus leading to zero ion-induced electric field. The electrical measurement
at 77 K for this device shows that there is no observable photocurrent
because of the zero ion-induced electric field under illumination
by a 532 nm laser with a power density of 0.5 mW/cm2, supported
by the zero open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current (Figure 3a). Because of the
ion migration being frozen out at 77 K, poling with the external electric
field would not induce any ion migration within MAPbI3 and
thus no ion-induced electric field, leading to zero opposite-direction
current (Figure 3b).

Figure 3 (a) Output
curves of the perovskite device in dark and under illumination
at 77 K and (b) temporal response curves without poling and under
negative and positive poling at 77 K. The device has not been either
poled at room temperature or poled during cooling. Thus, there is
no electric field induced by ion accumulation and no open-circuit
voltage and short-circuit current at 77 K. (c) Output curves of the
perovskite device in dark and under illumination at 77 K and (d) temporal
response curves without poling and under negative and positive poling
at 77 K. The device has been poled at room temperature, and thus there
is a small electric field induced by ion accumulation, leading to
a small open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current at 77 K. (e)
Output curves of the perovskite device in dark and under illumination
at 77 K and (f) temporal response curves without poling and under
negative and positive poling at 77 K. The device is always poled during
cooling; thus, there is a relatively large electric field induced
by ion accumulation, giving rise to a larger open-circuit voltage
and short-circuit current at 77 K. (g,h) The photocurrent under the
ion-induced electric field under light illumination with different
power for the device used in (e,f).

For the second case, first, we poled the device at room temperature
which indicates that ion migration exists within MAPbI3 and then cooled the device immediately down to 77 K for further
measurement. Different from the first case, we observed an open-circuit
voltage of 0.13 V and a short-circuit current of 0.038 nA (Figure 3c), which can be
attributed to uneven distribution of ions because of poling at room
temperature. Although the external electric field has been removed,
the migrated ions have not been completely restored to the original
uniform distribution state during the cooling process. The residue
of the migrated ions induces an electric field, which results in the
measurable open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current. In addition,
we observed a negative photocurrent of 0.038 nA under a 532 nm laser
illumination even without applying any external electric field (Figure 3d). Similar to the
first case, the applied external poling electric field cannot exert
any influence on the ion-induced electric field, which was supported
by the temporal response under illumination (Figure 3d).

For the third case, the device
was being poled with an external
electric field while being cooled simultaneously. For this case, the
diffusion of accumulated ions would be prohibited by the applied external
electric field during the cooling process until 77 K, by when the
ion migration has been totally frozen out. Thus, we expect a great
number of ions accumulate near the electrodes at 77 K, leading to
a large ion-induced electric field and thus large open-circuit voltage
and short-circuit current. Figure 3e,f shows the output curves of the MAPbI3 perovskite device both in dark and under illumination at 77 K and
temporal response curves without poling and under negative and positive
poling at 77 K, respectively. Compared with the second case, similar
results could be observed but the open-circuit voltage and short-circuit
current are much larger for the third case, which are 0.95 V and 0.063
nA at 77 K, respectively (Figure 3e). The ion-induced reverse current under a 532 nm
laser illumination (0.5 mW/cm2) also shows an independence
of the external poling electric field, with a constant reverse current
of 0.063 nA (Figure 3f), indicating the frozen out ion migration at 77 K. The corresponding
EQE is estimated to be 20% for this case.

We have also examined
the photocurrent because of the ion-induced
electric field under light illumination with different powers for
the device used in Figure 3e,f. With the increase of the light power, the photocurrent
would increase as well because of the increase of the photogenerated
carriers (Figure 3g). Figure 3f displays the extracted
photocurrent versus the illumination from Figure 3g. The photocurrent shows nearly a linear
increase with the light power, indicating the feasibility to use the
ion-migration-induced electronic junctions for photodetection.

For the third case, when the device is poled during the cooling
process, we have also studied the relationship between the cooling
temperature and the open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current
(Figure 4a) as well
as the photocurrent under the ion-induced electric field (Figure 4b) because the ion
migration strongly depends on the surrounding temperature.30,34 As shown in Figure 4a, as the temperature increases, both of the open-circuit voltage
and short-circuit current would decrease at first (77–140 K,
stage I) until they reach a plateau (140–240 K, stage II) and
then decrease (240–300 K, stage III) again. As previously reported,
MAPbI3 undergoes a first-order solid–solid phase
transition from tetragonal phase to orthorhombic phase around 160
K depending on the thickness of perovskites.38,39 Within the orthorhombic phase, there are small inclusions of the
tetragonal phase, the size of which decreases with the decrease of
the temperature.39 As the temperature further
decreases, the number of the grain boundaries continuously decreases,
leading to the increase of the carrier mobility. Thus, the increase
of the open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current might be due
to the phase transition at stage I. At stage II, the phase transition
has been completed, and the ion migration is still frozen out, thus
both open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current show temperature
independence. For stage III, when the temperature is above 240 K,
the ions start to migrate, which can lead to the decrease of the ion-induced
electric field and thus the decrease of both open-circuit voltage
and short-circuit current.30,34

Figure 4 (a) Temperature-dependent
open-circuit voltage and short-circuit
current and (b) temperature-dependent photocurrent induced by ion-induced
electric field. The device is always poled during the cooling process,
which is the same as the one measured in Figure 3e,f.

Figure 4b
shows
the temperature-dependent photocurrent induced by ion-induced electric
field (denoted as Irev). The absolute
value of Irev continuously increases with
the decrease of temperature and does not depend on the poling electric
field below 240 K, whereas above 240 K, it decreases with the decrease
of the temperature. The behavior below 240 K might be because of the
phase transition and temperature-dependent change of carrier mobility
as previous reported.39 Above 240 K, the
ion-migration starts to play a role in the ion-induced electric field,
which leads to an external electric-field-dependent Irev. The decrease of Irev with
the surrounding temperature might be because of the temperature-dependent
electron/hole transport. Previous studies show that both ions and
electron/hole transport are thermal-activated processes.34 With the decrease of the temperature, the electronic
current exponentially decreases, which leads to the decrease of the
observed Irev.

Conclusions
We
have demonstrated the creation of dynamic electronic junctions
via poling the MAPbI3 microplates for further photodetection
and energy harvesting. By manipulating the polarity of the external
electric field, we have successfully created p–n and n–p
junctions for photodetection with a faster response speed. Furthermore,
energy harvesting has also been achieved by freezing out the nonuniformly
distributed accumulated ions after electric-field-induced migration
at low temperature. Our studies not only help on the fundamental understanding
of the ion migrations in MAPbI3 but also shed light on
how to utilize the ion-migration effect for the potential optoelectronic
applications.

Experimental Section
Preparation of Methylammonium
Iodide Powder
Methylammonium
iodide (MAI, CH3NH3I) powder, which was used
as the intercalation source, was synthesized using a previously reported
method.15 Specifically, MAI was synthesized
by neutralizing 40 w/w % aqueous methylamine (MA) and 57 w/w % aqueous
hydriodic acid with a molar ratio of 1:1, which was stirred at 0 °C
for 4 h. The solvent was then evaporated at 60 °C, and the resultant
solid was washed three times with diethyl ether followed by drying
at 70 °C for 12 h.

Fabrication of Perovskite Microplate Devices
PbI2 aqueous solution (0.1 g/100 mL) was prepared by
dissolving
0.1 g of PbI2 in deionized water at 80 °C for 2 h
and then cooled down to room temperature, resulting in the formation
of the suspended PbI2 microplates. The Cr/Au (10 nm/100
nm) electrodes with a channel length of 20 μm were defined by
photolithography onto the SiO2/Si substrates and followed
by thermal evaporation and liftoff. Then, PbI2 microplate
suspension was dropped onto SiO2/Si substrates randomly,
and we can find the PbI2 microplates bridging the gap between
two electrodes. Finally, the dispersed PbI2 microplates
were further converted into CH3NH3PbI3 (denoted as MAPbI3) by vapor-phase intercalation.40

Electrical Measurement
Temperature-dependent
electrical
measurements were carried out in a probe station (Lakeshore, PS-100)
coupled with a computer-controlled analogue-to-digital converter (National
Instruments) and an SR570 current preamplifier. For the measurements
under illumination, a white LED with a power density of 1.4 mW/cm2 was used.
