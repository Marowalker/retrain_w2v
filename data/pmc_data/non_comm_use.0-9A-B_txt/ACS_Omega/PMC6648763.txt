Marine photosynthetic organisms emit
organic gases, including the
polyolefins isoprene (C5H8) and monoterpenes
(MTPs, C10H16), into the boundary layer. Their
atmospheric processing produces particles that influence cloud formation
and growth and, as a result, the Earth’s radiation balance.
Here, we report that the heterogeneous ozonolysis of dissolved α-pinene
by O3(g) on aqueous surfaces is dramatically accelerated
by I–, an anion enriched in the ocean upper microlayer
and sea spray aerosols (SSAs). In our experiments, liquid microjets
of α-pinene solutions, with and without added I–, are dosed with O3(g) for τ < 10 μs and
analyzed online by pneumatic ionization mass spectrometry. In the
absence of I–, α-pinene does not detectably
react with O3(g) under present conditions. In the presence
of ≥ 0.01 mM I–, in contrast, new signals
appear at m/z = 169 (C9H13O3–), m/z = 183 (C10H15O3–), m/z = 199
(C10H15O4–), m/z = 311 (C10H16IO3–), and m/z = 461 (C20H30IO4–), plus m/z = 175
(IO3–), and m/z = 381 (I3–). Collisional
fragmentation splits CO2 from C9H13O3–, C10H15O3– and C10H15O4–, and I– plus IO– from C10H16IO3– as expected from a trioxide IOOO•C10H16– structure. We infer
that the oxidative processing of α-pinene on aqueous surfaces
is significantly accelerated by I– via the formation
of IOOO– intermediates that are more reactive than
O3. A mechanism in which IOOO– reacts
with α-pinene (and likely with other unsaturated species) in
competition with its isomerization to IO3– accounts for present results and the fact that soluble iodine in
SSA is mostly present as iodine-containing organic species rather
than the thermodynamically more stable iodate. By this process, a
significant fraction of biogenic MTPs and other unsaturated gases
may be converted to water-soluble species rather than emitted to the
atmosphere.

Introduction
Particle production
by bursting bubbles at the air–sea interface
is the dominant global source of aerosols and a major global source
of aerosol number.1 The incessant production
of marine aerosols across the ocean contributes to the light-scattering
properties of the marine boundary layer.1 A key feature is that both marine aerosols and the uppermost microlayers
of the ocean are naturally enriched in amphiphilic and hydrophobic
organic matter relative to bulk seawater.2−5 Organic matter in the open ocean
is produced by photosynthetic organisms that generate volatile organic
compounds (VOCs), such as dimethyl sulfide (CH3SCH3), isoprene (C5H8), and monoterpenes
(MTPs, C10H16),3,6−12 among other species.13 The atmospheric
oxidation of VOCs is deemed to generate airborne particles affecting
cloud formation and growth. At present, however, large uncertainties
remain regarding the strengths of marine VOCs sources, their dependence
on environmental variables, such as temperature, salinity, and insolation,
and the mechanisms of their chemical transformations.12,14

Isoprene and MTPs terrestrial emissions are mainly processed
in
the gas phase by ozone and OH-radicals.15 The marine environment is qualitatively different. The large surface
area density (surface area per unit volume of air) of sea spray aerosol
(SSA) particles in the marine boundary layer enhances the role of
heterogeneous versus gas-phase processes.2 Significantly, the coarse (0.1–10 μm) SSA particles
produced from the bursting of air bubbles at the sea surface16,17 reflect the composition of interfacial microlayers.17,18 Interfacial microlayers are not only enriched in surfactants but
are preferentially populated by anions, as attested by the negative
polarity of the ocean’s surface.19−22 Iodide, the largest halide, is
enriched up to 103 times in SSA droplets relative to bulk
seawater.23−25

Other phenomena cooperate to enhancing interfacial
chemistry on
SSA. Hydrophobic VOCs tend to populate the water-deficient interfacial
layers rather than dissolving in bulk water. The consequence is that
their concentrations at interfacial layers may exceed those calculated
from Henry’s law constants for gas-bulk water equilibria.26−28 Furthermore, most interfacial gas–liquid reactions are usually
faster than those estimated from kinetic parameters in bulk water.29−35

Ozone is a thermodynamically strong but kinetically sluggish
two-electron
oxidizer.36 For example, O3 reacts
with Br– and Cl– in bulk water
with relatively small rate constants kbromide+O3 ≈ 1 × 102 M–1 s–1, kchloride+O3 ≈ 1 × 10–2 M–1 s–1, whereas, in marked contrast, it reacts with
I– at diffusion-controlled rates (kiodide+O3 ≈ 1 × 109 M–1 s–1).37 The reason is that the spin-forbiddenness of the exothermic channels
leading to ground-state 3O2 (X– + O3 → XO– + 1,3O2; X = Cl–, Br– or I–) is selectively lifted by I– due
to a heavy-atom effect.31 As a result,
given the huge I– enrichment in SSA droplets and
the fact that I– reacts with O3 at diffusion-controlled
rates, O3(g) molecules colliding with SSA droplets are
expected to largely react with I–. The final products
of the (I– + O3) reaction are iodate
IO3– and triiodide I3–.38−40 The mechanism of reaction, inferred from measured
IO3–/I3– ratios as functions of [I–] and [O3], suggests the initial formation of an IOOO– intermediate
(Scheme 1).31,37 IOOO– is deemed to be the species that mediates
the oxidation of Cl– and Br– into
gas-phase halogens over the oceans.31 It
is related to the interfacial Br–OOO– intermediate
recently identified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.41

Scheme 1 Mechanism of Reaction
Carboxylates (−)169,
(−)183 and (−)199 could also be formed directly from
IOOO− and alpha-pinene, bypassing the (−)311
intermediate.

The preceding considerations
suggest that heterogeneous iodine
chemistry on SSA droplets could play an important role in the marine
boundary layers.42 Could the IOOO– intermediates react faster than O3 with the biogenic
marine MTPs emerging to the surface of the ocean?42−44 This phenomenon
would enhance the oxidation of MTPs in the condensed phase prior to
their release into the atmosphere. It would also explain why most
soluble iodide in SSA is present as nonbiogenic iodine-containing
species rather than the thermodynamically more stable iodate IO3–.25,45−52 Here, we address these issues and report on the oxidation of α-pinene
by O3(g) in an aqueous organic solvent mixture, in the
presence and absence of I–.

Experimental Section
In our experiments, α-pinene (Sigma-Aldrich, >98% pure,
used
as received) solutions in water/acetonitrile mixtures or methanol,
with or without added NaI, are injected (at 50 μL min–1) as liquid microjets (at a linear velocity v =
11 cm s–1) into the reaction chamber of an pneumatic
ionization mass spectrometer (PI-MS, Agilent 1100 MSD series, modified
with an orthogonal inlet port for gas reactants) through an electrically
grounded stainless-steel syringe needle (100 μm bore). The functionality
of products was characterized by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS).
The spraying chamber is flushed with N2(g) and maintained
at 1 atm, 298 K. The liquid microjets are fragmented (within τR < 10 μs) into charged microdroplets by a high velocity
(∼250 m s–1) nebulizer gas [N2(g)] flowing through a sheath coaxial with the syringe needle. In
these events, the kinetic energy (KE) of the nebulizing gas provides
energy for creating the surfaces of the microdroplets and for charging
the microdroplets by separating the anions and cations already present
in the microjets. Nebulization is the single event that generates
the net charges detected as mass spectral signals. This charging process
does not require but may be enhanced by the presence of an electric
field. We have shown that in our setup the creation of net charge
is mainly due to pneumatic nebulization rather than due to the applied
electric field needed to deflect the charged microdroplets toward
the mass analyzer.29,53 Reactive events take place upon
exposing the liquid microjets to O3(g) during their τ
< 10 μs lifetimes prior to nebulization. Reaction products
are detected online without manipulation by PI-MS in less than 1 ms.
We have shown that the detected ions originate from species produced
in the outermost interfacial layers of intact liquid microjets, rather
than on the microdroplets produced by nebulization, or in gas-phase
reactions. Further experimental details may be found in previous publications.29,32,54,55

Ozone was generated by flowing ultrapure O2(g)
(>99.998%)
through a silent discharge ozonizer and quantified via online UV–vis
absorption spectrophotometry (HP 8452) before entering the reaction
chamber. Reported [O3(g)] values correspond to concentrations
on the surface of the liquid microjets, which we estimated by multiplying
the concentrations determined by absorption spectrophotometry by a
∼1/10 factor due to dilution by the nebulizing gas flow. Conditions
in these experiments were drying nitrogen gas flow rate: 10 L min–1; drying nitrogen gas temperature: 340 °C; and
capillary inlet voltage: +3.5 kV relative to the grounded injector.

Results
and Discussion
The negative ion mass spectrum obtained in
experiments involving
microjets of 6.4 mM α-pinene solutions in water/acetonitrile
mixtures (1:4/v/v) exposed to 630 ppmv O3(g) for τR < 10 μs is shown as a black trace in Figure 1. Note that signals are within
the background noise level. Reactant concentrations were chosen to
produce detectable products during the short τR <
10 μs contact times. It should be emphasized that in our experiments,
ozone exposures E = [O3(g)] × τR ≤ 630 ppmv × 10 μs = 6.3 ppbv s are much
smaller than typical exposures to 20 ppb O3(g) (see below)
for 1 h: 20 ppbv × 3600 s = 7.2 × 104 ppbv s,
in remote marine boundary layers. As a reference, the half-life of
gas-phase α-pinene toward O3 in the troposphere is
∼4 h.44 By analogy with reported
rate constants for the (1-hexene-4-ol + O3) reaction in
water56 and in the gas phase,57 we assume that the rate constant of the (α-pinene
+ O3) reaction in bulk water is within a factor of two
of its value in the gas phase: kbulk water(α-pinene + O3) = 8.7 × 10–17 cm3 molecule–1 s–1 = 5.2 × 104 M–1 s–1. Therefore, the largest possible value of the pseudo first-order
rate constant for α-pinene decay in bulk water in equilibrium
with 630 ppmv O3(g), that is, [O3]aq = 6.3 μM, (from Henry’s law constant for O3 in water at 298 K: H = 0.01 M atm–1)58 would be 1k = (5.2 × 104 M–1 s–1) × 6.3 μM = 0.3 s–1. In consequence,
the shortest predicted half-life of α-pinene in experiments
performed under such conditions would be a few seconds, which is ∼6
orders of magnitude longer than the τR < 10 μs
time window of our experiments. However, as another example that most
interfacial reactions run faster than anticipated from kinetic data
in bulk water, we have found that dissolved α-pinene does react
with O3(g) to produce small amounts of the neutral α-hydroxy
hydroperoxides (detected as chloride adducts in the presence of added
NaCl) expected from the addition of water to the putative Criegee
intermediates.59

Figure 1 Colored traces are mass
spectral signal intensities (vertical axis,
in arbitrary units) of the anions produced on the surface of microjets
of (6.4 mM α-pinene + 0.1 mM NaI) solutions in water/acetonitrile/1:4
(v/v) exposed to different O3(g) concentrations for <10
μs. Signals correspond to m/z = 169 (C9H13O3–), m/z = 183 (C10H15O3–), m/z = 199 (C10H15O4–), m/z = 311 (C10H16IO3–), and m/z = 461 (C20H30IO4–), plus m/z =
175 (IO3–) and m/z = 381 (I3–) species. Note
the small amounts of I3– present (from
I– autoxidation in the injected iodide solutions)
in the absence of O3(g) (blue trace).The black trace corresponds
to mass spectral signal intensities from of 6.4 mM α-pinene
solutions in water/acetonitrile/1:4 (v/v) (i.e., in the absence of
iodide) exposed to 630 ppmv O3(g) for <10 μs.
Note the low intensity of m/z =
169 (C9H13O3–), m/z = 183 (C10H15O3–), and m/z = 199 (C10H15O4–) signals in the absence of NaI, which are due to α-pinene
impurities.

We obtained very different
results in the presence of NaI. The
blue trace in Figure 1 corresponds to a mass spectrum obtained from 0.1 mM NaI solutions
in a water/acetonitrile (1:4/v/v) in the absence of O3.
The dominant peak at m/z = 277 corresponds
to a NaI2– cluster ion. We verified that
acetonitrile is inert toward O3(g) in our experiments,
in the presence or absence of I–.60,61 Experiments performed by exposing (6.4 mM α-pinene + 0.1 mM
NaI) solutions in water/acetonitrile (1:4/v/v) to O3(g)
in the reactor chamber of the mass spectrometer led to the mass spectra
shown as green, dark pink, and red traces in Figure 1. New, major mass spectral signals appear
at m/z = 169 (C9H13O3–), m/z = 183 (C10H15O3–), m/z = 199 (C10H15O4–), m/z = 311 (C10H16IOOO–), and m/z = 461 (C20H30IO4–), plus m/z = 175 (IO3–), and m/z = 381 (I3–). The same products were also observed from (5 mM α-pinene
+ 0.1 mM NaI) solutions in methanol (Figure S1). Additional experiments showed that C10H16IO3– is the product of the addition
of an IOOO– trioxide intermediate to α-pinene
rather than an α-pinene-IO3- adduct
(see below). These experiments imply that O3(g) oxidizes
I– to produce intermediates that react with α-pinene
much faster than O3(g). We had previously found that these
intermediates, likely IOOO– (and, possibly HOI),
are also very reactive toward other species, such as halide anions
and sulfite.31,32 We,54,60,62 and others,33−35,63 have found that heterogeneous reactions on the surfaces of liquids
are significantly faster than those in the bulk phases.

Figure 2 reports
the dependence of mass signal intensities on fragmentor voltage (FV).
FV is the electrical potential difference between the exit of the
heated capillary and first skimmer of the mass spectrometer.29 In this region, ions are accelerated up to excess
laboratory KEs given by KE = FV × zie = 1/2mivi2, where zie is the charge, mi is the mass, and vi is the excess velocity of ion i. Molecular
ions convert their excess KE into internal (vibrational and rotational)
excitation during impact with the N2 bath gas molecules.
KE are converted to center-of-mass (CEM) KEs by the following relationship:
CEM = m/(m + mi)KE, where m = 28 is the
molecular mass of the N2 collider gas.30 The CEM onsets of fragmentation, in volts, for the different
species are collected in Table 1. These experiments reveal that (−)183 and (−)199
are carboxylates, which we assume are the anions of pinonic and hydroxypinonic
acids, which split CO2 upon fragmentation.64 The (−)169 signal which splits CO2 may
correspond to the anion of pinalic acid. These assignments are based
on literature reports65 because molecular
structures cannot be deduced solely from the molecular formulas provided
by mass spectrometry. The (−)311 anion both splits (−)143
(IO–) and (−)127 (I–),
as expected from a species containing a IO– functionality.
We confirmed that the (−)143 anion is IO– because it splits I–. Distinctively, (−)461
fragments into I– and (−)311 at a threshold
voltage significantly lower than for the other species. This finding
suggests a weakly bound species which formally corresponds to the
association of partially oxidized α-pinene C10H16O2 (136 + O2) with (−)311, followed
by a H2O loss: 461 = (136 + 32) + (136 + 127 + 48) –
18.

on the surface of microjets of (α-pinene + NaI) solutions in

The dependences of the inorganic products
of I– oxidation, iodate IO3–, and triiodide
I3– (Figure 3A) and those derived from the reaction of
α-pinene with IOOO– (Figure 3B,C) as functions of [NaI] and [α-pinene]
(Figure 4) are consistent
with the mechanism of Scheme 1. In Figure 3D, the negligible intensity of the m/z = 311 mass signal in the presence of added IO3– in the absence of O3 (i.e., at [O3] = 0),
in conjunction with its fragmentation into (−)143 (IO–) and (−)127 (I–) (see above), strongly
suggests that this species is a covalent trioxide IOOOC10H16– rather than a C10H16–IO3– adduct. Furthermore,
the competition between α-pinene and I– for
the putative trioxide IOOO– accounts for the direct
and inverse dependences of the signal intensities of the inorganic
species IO3– and I3– versus those of the (−)311, (−)168, (−)183,
and (−)199 organic species, as functions of the [I–]/[α-pinene] ratio. As mentioned above, because the formation
of the (−)461 species requires relatively larger concentrations
of α-pinene (Figure 4), it may not be relevant to the chemistry of SSA droplets
in the marine boundary layer. It is apparent that the formation of
IO3– and I3–, and also of I2, will be quenched by unsaturated species
such as MTPs and other unsaturated species, such as the polyunsaturated
fatty acids66 present on the surface of
oceans over active phytoplankton populations. The iodine-containing
organic species m/z = 311 (C10H16IO3–) and m/z = 461 (C20H30IO4–) are considered representatives
of the class of unidentified soluble organic iodine (UOIs) species
detected in SSA particles.45,46 Our results provide
a chemical, as opposed to a biological mechanism for the incorporation
of iodide into UOIs, which account for up to 50% of total soluble
iodine (TSI) and up to 70% of soluble organic iodine (SOI) in SSA.45,46,67

IO3–m/z = 175 at [O3] = 0 proves that it is associated with a
C10H16IOOO– trioxide rather
than a C10H16–IO3– adduct. Connecting lines are guides to the eye.

guides to the eye.

How fast could these
interfacial processes be under realistic marine
boundary conditions? We base our estimates on the total integral properties
(in the 0.1–30 μm particle radius range) of SSA populations
in the boundary layer at 80% relative humidity under a mean wind speed
of u = 10 m s–1 at 10 m above the
sea surface.4 From Table 15, p 174 of ref (4), we assume SSA populations
of specific surface area (SSA integral area per cm–3 of air at 80% relative humidity): A80 ≈ 300 μm2 cm–3 = 3 ×
10–6 cm2 cm–3 and specific
volume: V80 ≈ 500 μm3 cm–3 = 5 × 10–10 cm3 cm–3. We assume typical 20 ppbv
O3(g) = 5 × 1011 molecules cm–3 (at 1 atm, 300 K), daytime concentrations over the ocean.68 We also assume a representative median concentration
of TSI in aerosols of [TSI] ≈ 200 pmol m–3 = 1.2 × 108 iodine atoms cm–3 (in
SSA particles collected in all impactor stages), which is mostly associated
with the SOI fraction.25,48 We verified that this figure
is in the range reported by independent studies.69 Therefore, the actual concentration of iodine in SSA particles
is [iodine]SSA = [TSI]/V80 =
2.4 × 1017 I atoms cm–3 = 0.4 mM.
It should be emphasized that the actual concentration of free, oxidizable
I– may be a fraction of that figure. Note that the
mean concentration of iodide at the sea surface is [I–]sea surface ≈ 0.250 μM,24 that is, about 3 orders of magnitude smaller
than [iodine]SSA.

By assuming that the diffusive
gas-phase resistance to microsized
SSA particles can be neglected as a first approximation,70 the flux of O3(g) molecules, FO3, that would react with dissolved
I– to produce IOOO– can be estimated
from the kinetic theory of gases:70,71FO3 = 1/4cO3nO3γO3 ≈ 4.5 × 1015γO3 molecules cm–2 s–1. cO3 = 3.63 × 104 cm s–1 is the mean thermal velocity of
O3 molecules at 300 K, and γO3 is the reactive uptake coefficient of O3 on SSA droplets.
By adopting the γO3 ≈ 10–4 value reported on aqueous [I–] ≈ 0.1 mM
solutions,39 we arrive at FO3 ≈ 4.5 × 1011 molecules
cm–2 s–1. The rate at which SSA
I– would be titrated by O3 is therefore FO3A80 ≈ 1.4 × 106 I– ions cm–3 s–1. These estimates show that
O3(g) will titrate half of the I– into
IOOO– in air containing [TSI] ≈ 1.2 ×
108 iodine atoms cm–3 in less than a
minute.

The rate of oxidation of I– by O3(g)
in the outermost interfacial layers of the ocean can be estimated
from an interfacial iodide concentration given by [I–]interfacial = 0.250 μM × δ = (1.5 ×
1014 I– ions cm–3)
× (3 × 10–4 cm) = 4.5 × 1010 I– ions cm–2, where δ
= 3 × 10–4 cm is the reacto-diffusive length
of O3 in [I–] ≈ 0.1 μM seawater.39 The critical difference between the sea surface
and SSA particles is that at [I–] ≈ 0.1 μM,
the reactive uptake coefficient of O3(g) is about 3 orders
of magnitude smaller than on SSA particles: γO3 ≈ 10–7.39 If the incorporation of O3(g) into seawater were exclusively
controlled by its reaction with I–, we estimate
that the flux of O3(g) into seawater would be FO3 ≈ 4.5 × 108 molecules
cm–2 s–1 and, therefore, that
[I–]interfacial = 4.5 × 1010 I– ions cm–2 would be also titrated
in about a minute. However, the fact that the velocity of dry deposition
of O3(g) on the ocean, vd,
was found to be enhanced by wind velocity u reveals
the importance of wind-induced turbulent gas-transfer.12 In fact, vd increases
fivefold from 0.016 to 0.078 cm s–1 as wind speed
goes from u = 0 to 20 m s–1.72 Therefore, at a mean vd ≈ 0.03 cm s–1 value, ∼1.5
× 1010 O3 molecules cm–2 s–1 would penetrate the surface of the ocean,
that is, that O3(g) will titrate [I–]interfacial = 4.5 × 1010 I– ions cm–2 in a few seconds. Note that this estimate
could be a lower limit if the reaction were also partially controlled
by aqueous phase resistance in the surface of water. It is apparent
that the chemistry delineated by our experiments and analysis could
rapidly process marine biogenic gas emissions whether at the ocean
surface or on SSA.49,73−75

Summing
up, we have shown that iodide at low concentrations dramatically
accelerates the conversion by O3 of α-pinene on aqueous
surfaces into organic acids and I-containing organic species. Our
findings provide a plausible mechanism for the formation of the unidentified
soluble iodine-containing organic anionic species detected on SSA
droplets and for the low concentrations of IO3– therein.45,46 They also suggest that a fraction
of the MTPs and other VOCs produced by marine organisms may not be
emitted to the atmosphere but converted to species dissolved in seawater
or SSA droplets. This process should be eventually considered and
incorporated in current estimates of isoprene and MTP ocean fluxes
based on correlations between laboratory data production rates and
chlorophyll satellite sightings, as reported by a recent, authoritative
review on marine isoprene and MTP emissions.10,76
