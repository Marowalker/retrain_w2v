and {CpFeII(CO)2[SnII(TPP•3–)]} (5, TPP: tetraphenylporphyrin) complexes in which
CpFeII(CO)2 fragments (Cp: Cp or Cp*) are coordinated
to SnII(macrocycle•3–) have been
obtained. The product complexes were obtained at the reaction of charge
transfer from CpFeI(CO)2 (Cp: Cp or Cp*) to
[SnII(macrocycle2−)] to form the diamagnetic
FeII and paramagnetic radical trianionic macrocycles. As
a result, these formally neutral complexes contain S = 1/2 spins delocalized over the macrocycles. This provides alternation
of the C–Nimine or C–Cmeso bonds
in the macrocycles, the appearance of new bands in the near-infrared
spectra of the complexes, and blue shift of both Soret and Q-bands.
The {CpFeII(CO)2SnII(macrocycle•3–)} units (Cp: Cp or Cp*, macrocycle: Pc or
Nc) form closely packed π-stacking dimers in 1 and 3 or one-dimensional chains in 2 and 4 with effective π–π interaction between the macrocycles.
Such packing allows strong antiferromagnetic coupling between S = 1/2 spins. Magnetic interaction can be described well
by the Heisenberg model for the isolated dimers in 1 and 3 with exchange interaction J/kB = −78 and −85 K, respectively. Magnetic
behavior of 2 and 4 is described well by
the model that includes contributions from an antiferromagnetically
coupled S = 1/2 dimer (Jintra) and a Heisenberg S = 1/2 chain with alternating
antiferromagnetic spin exchange between the neighbors (Jinter). Compound 2 demonstrates large intradimer
interaction of Jintra/kB = −54 K and essentially weaker interdimer exchange
interactions of Jinter/kB = −6 K, whereas compound 4 shows
strong magnetic coupling of spins within the dimers (Jintra/kB = −170 K)
as well as between the dimers (Jinter/kB = −40 K). Compound {CpFeII(CO)2[SnII(TPP•3–)]}
(5) shows no π–π interactions between
the porphyrin macrocycles, and magnetic coupling is weak in this case
(Weiss temperature is −5 K). Preparation of a similar complex
with indium(III) chloride phthalocyanine yields {CpFe(CO)2[In(Pc2–)]} (6). In this complex,
indium(III) atoms are reduced instead of the phthalocyanine macrocycles
that explains electron paramagnetic resonance silence of 6 in the 4–295 K range.

1 Introduction
Metal
macrocycles can possess promising physical properties. Some
metal phthalocyanine (Pc) derivatives can be used as materials for
optical and electronic devices and different types of sensors.1 Conducting compounds were obtained by chemical
or electrochemical oxidation of metal-free and metal-containing phthalocyanines.2 Oxidation of manganese(II) macrocycles or reduction
of iron(II) phthalocyanine yields compounds with ferrimagnetic ordering
of spins.3 Generally, magnetic assemblies
are prepared using macrocycles containing paramagnetic metals in the
center such as MnIII in {MnIII(macrocycle2–)}+ or FeI in {FeI(Pc2–)}−. These metal atoms form
one-dimensional (1D) chains with paramagnetic radical anions of π-acceptors
(like tetracyanoethylene) or metallocenium cations providing alternation
of spins having different magnetic moments. As a result, antiferromagnetic
ordering of these spins within the chains provides ferrimagnetic behavior.3

Magnetic assemblies can also be developed
on the basis of oxidized
or reduced macrocycles with unpaired π-electrons. Oxidation
of different metal macrocycles providing highly conducting materials
was intensively studied.2c Reduction of
metal macrocycles results in the formation of radical trianions with S = 1/2 spin state. When such radical trianionic macrocycles
are packed in π-stacking dimers or two-dimensional (2D) layers
with effective π–π interaction between them, strong
enough magnetic coupling of spins can be attained with exchange interaction
(J/kB) up to −255
K4 or even stronger for the naphthalocyanine
(Nc) radical trianions.5 In these salts,
counter cations are present to compensate negative charge and solvent
molecules are frequently involved in the crystals to occupy vacancies
in the packing of the ionic components. Therefore, reduced metal macrocycles
can be obtained in two- or even three-component compounds in general.
Single-component compounds can also contain radical trianionic macrocycles,
and in this case, their unpaired electrons can participate in strong
magnetic interactions or the realization of high conductivity. However,
compounds of such type are very rare. One of the examples is a formally
neutral compound Ph5CpRu(CO)2[SnII(Pc•3–)] containing tin(II) phthalocyanine
radical trianions showing strong magnetic coupling of spins with exchange
interaction of J/kB =
−183 K.4f Compounds in which the
negative charge of the radical trianionic macrocycle•3– is compensated by positive charge of the central metal atom are
also known.6

Single-component compounds
with the reduced macrocycles can be
obtained at a combination of donor and acceptor parts in one molecule
to realize charge transfer between them. Coordination complexes of
transition metals with tin, indium, and thallium macrocycles are known.4f,7 In {cryptand(Na+)}{CpFeII(CO)2[SnII(Pc4–)]}·1.5C6H4Cl2, unusual charge transfer is realized from CpFeI(CO)2 to {SnII(Pc•3–)}•3– to form diamagnetic CpFeII(CO)2 and the {SnII(Pc4–)}2– dianions.4f It should
be noted that metal phthalocyanine dianions are formed at very negative
reduction potentials ranging from −1.1 to −1.5 V versus
saturated calomel electrode.8 Therefore,
CpFeI(CO)2 coordinated to SnII(macrocycle2–) has a tendency to transfer one electron to the dianionic
macrocycle. Potentially, this allows one to design neutral radicals
with intrinsic charge transfer having S = 1/2 spin
on the radical trianionic macrocycle. CpFeI(CO)2[SnII(Pc2–)]·2C6H4Cl2 was also obtained by the interaction of {CpFeI(CO)2}2 dimers with the {cryptand(Na+)}{SnIVCl2(Pc•3–)}•– salt. However, all data indicate that
there is no charge transfer from FeI to the Pc macrocycle
in this compound and S = 1/2 spin is localized on
the FeI atoms.4f

We studied
the interaction of two types of {CpFeI(CO)2}
and {Cp*FeI(CO)2} dimers with cyclopentadiene
and pentamethylcyclopentadiene ligands, respectively, with SnII(macrocycle2–) compounds, where macrocycle
is phthalocyanine (Pc), naphthalocyanine (Nc), or tetraphenylporphyrin
(TPP), and obtained a series of coordination complexes {CpFeII(CO)2[SnII(Pc•3–)]}
{Cp: Cp (1, 2) or Cp* (3)},
{Cp*FeII(CO)2[SnII(Nc•3–)]} (4), and {CpFeII(CO)2[SnII(TPP•3–)]} (5) (Table 1). It is shown that
the charge transfer realized in 1–5 is accompanied by the formation of radical trianionic macrocycles.
This is an unusual fact, especially for tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP)
macrocycle that has a very negative reduction potential.9 Since no counter cations are present in these
complexes, dense packing of the macrocycles is attained in 1–4, providing effective π–π
interactions between them in the dimers or 1D chains and strong magnetic
coupling between S = 1/2 spins. To study how the
metal of phthalocyanine affects charge transfer, we also obtained
and studied a similar coordination complex with indium(III) phthalocyanine,
{CpFe(CO)2[In(Pc2–)]} (6), and showed that in this case, indium atoms are reduced instead
of the macrocycles.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis
Starting
reagents used
in the synthesis and composition of the obtained complexes are listed
in Table 1. Scheme
of the reactions is shown in Scheme 1. We developed two synthetic routes to prepare coordination
complexes of such type. First of all, tin(II) phthalocyanine or naphthalocyanine
can be dissolved in o-dichlorobenzene in the presence
of a large excess of {CpFe(CO)2}2 (Cp: Cp or
Cp*). Stirring of the mixtures during 8 h at 80 °C provides complete
dissolution of pristine tin(II) phthalocyanine or naphthalocyanine
to form deep blue or green solutions, respectively, which are characteristic
of their radical anions. This is rather unusual, especially for tin(II)
naphthalocyanine, which is very poorly soluble not only in neutral
state but in the radical anion state as well. Therefore, these coordination
complexes are well soluble even in relatively nonpolar o-dichlorobenzene. Interaction of tin(IV) dichloride phthalocyanine
with a large excess of {CpFeI(CO)2}2 also provides the formation of a second phase of {CpFeII(CO)2[SnII(Pc•3–)]}
(2). Most probably, at the first stage, the {CpFeI(CO)2}2 dimers reduce SnIV to SnII, abstracting chloride anions and forming CpFeII(CO)2Cl and SnII(Pc2–). The latter compound further interacts with an excess of {CpFeI(CO)2}2. The second route uses Cp*2Cr as a reductant. SnIVCl2(TPP2–) cannot be reduced to SnII(TPP2–) by
{CpFeI(CO)2}2 since no visible changes
in color are observed at their interaction. It is known that SnII(TPP2–) has very strong donor properties10 and probably {CpFeI(CO)2}2 is too weak a donor to reduce SnIVCl2(TPP2–) to SnII(TPP2–). In this case, two equivalents of essentially stronger reductant
Cp*2CrII (Eox =
−1.04 V)11 were added, providing
immediate color changes of the solution from green to deep red. Slow
mixing of the obtained solution with n-hexane yields
complex 5. Interaction of indium(III) chloride phthalocyanine
with {CpFeI(CO)2}2 is accompanied
by only partial dissolution of phthalocyanine to form a green solution.
The addition of one equivalent of Cp*2CrII to
the reaction mixture is accompanied by complete dissolution of phthalocyanine
and the formation of an initially blue solution. This indicates the
formation of {InIIICl(Pc•3–)}•–. However, several hours later, the color of
the solution changes to deep green, indicating that further reaction
proceeds through the addition of CpFeI(CO)2.
Crystals of 6 were obtained by slow mixing of this solution
with n-hexane.

Scheme 1 Synthesis from SnII(Pc2–) and {CpFeI(CO)2}2 yields two phases that were
labeled as complexes 1 and 2. They have
a similar composition but different crystal structures. Crystals of
two phases were separated under a microscope depending on shape and
color. Synthesis starting from SnIVCl2(Pc2–) and {CpFeI(CO)2}2 yields complex 1 exclusively. Composition of the obtained
complexes was determined from X-ray diffraction on single crystals.
Several crystals tested from the synthesis of 3–6 have the same unit cell parameters for each compound showing
the formation of one crystal phase. Elemental analysis cannot be used
to confirm the composition of the complexes due to high air sensitivity
of the crystals and their oxidation during the procedure of elemental
analysis. Probably this is due to the presence of highly air-sensitive
radical trianions of the macrocycles.

2.2 Optical
Spectra of the Complexes
Pristine SnII(Pc2–) has a Soret band
at 342 nm, and a broad Q-band is manifested as a split band with a
maximum at 726 nm (Figure 1, left panel, spectrum a). Optical properties of the [SnII(Pc•3–)]•– radical anions were studied in the {cryptand(Na+)}[SnII(Pc•3–)]•–·C6H4Cl2 salt.4f The acceptance of one electron accommodated on the Pc macrocycle
results in a blue shift of the Soret and Q-bands from 342 to 337 nm
and from 726 to 649 nm, respectively. A new intense band also observed
in the near-infrared (NIR) range at 1032 nm can be attributed to the
transitions from the populated lowest unoccupied molecular orbital
(LUMO) to empty LUMO + 1. Spectra of coordination complexes 1–3 with tin(II) phthalocyanine shown
in Figure 1 (left panel,
spectra b–d) are similar. They have the Soret band at 327–334
nm, and the Q-band is split into three bands, with a maximum at 618
nm. It is seen that both bands are noticeably blue-shifted in the
spectra of 1–3 in comparison with
the spectrum of SnII(Pc2–). An intense
band is observed in the NIR spectra of 1–3, with the maxima at 1064–1071 nm. All these changes
unambiguously show conversion of SnII(Pc2–) to SnII(Pc•3–) in 1–3. Experimental data for the solutions and calculations12,13 support that the 1a1u(π)–1eg(π*)
transitions associated with the Q-band of the metal phthalocyanines
are blue-shifted at the Pc-centered reduction. For example, the Q-band
was observed in the spectrum of NiII(Pc2–) at 671 nm and at 630 and 568 nm for [NiII(Pc•3–)]•–. It was also seen that [NiII(Pc•3–)]•– manifests
bands in the NIR solution spectrum at 915 nm.12

spectra: (left panel) pristine SnII(Pc2–) (a) and complexes 1 (b), 2 (c), and 3 (d); (right panel) pristine
SnII(Nc2–) (a) and complex 4 (b).

Red shift of the NIR bands in
the spectra of 1–3 (1064–1071
nm) in comparison to that for {cryptand(Na+)}[SnII(Pc•3–)]•–·C6H4Cl2 (1032 nm) can be attributed
to the coordination of the CpFe(CO)2 (Cp: Cp or Cp*) to
SnII(Pc•3–). Similar red shifts
of the NIR bands are observed in the spectra of coordination complexes
of [SnII(Pc•3–)]•– with other metal fragments (Fe(CO)4, Cp*RhCl, CpMo(CO)2).4f The formation of SnII(Pc•3–) in 1–3 allows us to suppose that electron is transferred from CpFeI(CO)2 to the Pc2– macrocycle,
forming correspondingly CpFeII(CO)2 (Cp: Cp
or Cp*) and SnII(Pc•3–).

The spectrum of pristine SnII(Nc2–)
shows the positions of the Soret and Q-bands at 349 and 841 nm,
respectively (Figure 1, right panel, spectrum a). Spectral features of the Nc•3– radical trianions were studied in (PPN+){TiIVO(Nc•3–)}•–·2C6H4Cl2.5 The
Soret band is manifested in the spectrum of this salt at 340 nm, whereas
the Q-band splits into two bands and is manifested at 697 (max) and
814 nm. The spectrum of the salt also shows a new band in the NIR
range at 1159 nm, which unambiguously justifies the Nc•3– formation. The spectrum of {Cp*FeII(CO)2[SnII(Nc•3–)]}·2C6H4Cl2 (4) (Figure 1, right panel, spectrum b) shows features
similar to those of (PPN+){TiIVO(Nc•3–)}•–·2C6H4Cl2 since the Soret band is manifested in the spectrum of 4 at 347 nm and the Q-band split into two bands is manifested
at 765 (max) and 846 nm. It is seen that blue shifts are observed
for both bands but they are smaller than that in the spectrum of (PPN+){TiIVO(Nc•3–)}•–·2C6H4Cl2. The appearance of
a new low-energy band at 1276 nm in the spectrum of 4 supports the formation of Nc•3– due to
the electron transfer from CpFeI(CO)2. It is
noticeable that like in 1–3, coordination
of Cp*FeII(CO)2 to {SnII(Nc•3–)} provides red shift of the NIR band (1276 nm) relative to the non-coordinated
{TiIVO(Nc•3–)}•– radical anions (1159 nm).5

Spectra
of pristine SnIVCl2(TPP2–)
and complex 5 are shown in Figure S13, and positions of the bands are listed in Table 2. This porphyrin shows the Soret
(main band at 442 nm) and weaker Q-bands (523, 569, and 608 nm). The
spectrum of 5 has a Soret band at 441 nm, whereas the
lower energy bands are manifested at 592 and 637 nm (Figure S13). The formation of 5 is accompanied
not only by the macrocycle reduction but the SnIVCl2 fragment is converted to SnII as well. That can
additionally modify the spectrum of 5. One of the possibilities
is the attribution of the band at 637 nm to SnII(TPP•3–), and in this case, both Soret and Q-bands
are blue-shifted. Reduction of free-base tetra(4-pyridyl)porphyrin
provides no essential shift of the Soret band; strong redistribution
of intensity of the Q-bands and a new weak band is manifested at 900
nm.14a

Spectra of pristine InIIICl(Pc2–)
and complex {CpFe(CO)2In(Pc2–)} (6) are shown in Figure 2. Pristine InIIICl(Pc2–) exhibits
the Soret band at 372 nm and the Q-band at 727 nm. The formation of 6 only weakly affects the spectrum since the Q-band is observed
in the spectrum of 6 at 336 nm and a narrow split Q-band
has a maximum at 708 nm. Therefore, only a weak blue shift of the
Q-band is observed at the formation of 6. The band at
1012 nm attributed to Pc•3– is very weak
in the spectrum of 6, indicating a small amount of these
species in the complex. Thus, in contrast to 1–3, no electron transfer to the Pc2– macrocycle
is observed in 6.

Figure 2 UV–visible–NIR spectra of
pristine InIIICl(Pc2–) (a) and coordination
complex 6 (b).

IR spectra of 1–6 in the
400–1600
and 1700–2060 cm–1 ranges are shown in Figures 3 and S1–S12, and the positions of the bands
are listed in Tables S1 and S2. The spectra
contain absorption bands of metal macrocycles, the CpFe(CO)2 (Cp: Cp or Cp*) fragments, and in some cases solvent molecules (Tables S1 and S2). There are noticeable shifts
and redistribution of intensities of the absorption bands of metal
macrocycles. For example, at the formation of Pc•3– in 1–3, a strong band at 725 cm–1 is shifted to 704–709 cm–1 as well as a strong band at 1059 cm–1 nearly disappears
at the same position of the band. It is interesting that changes characteristic
of the reduced Pc•3– macrocycle are absent
in the spectrum of 6, indicating that Pc still has the
Pc2– charge state. In this case, the band at 724
cm–1 preserves its position and the band at 1059
cm–1 still has strong intensity.

Figure 3 IR spectra of pristine
{CpFe(CO)2}2 dimer
and coordination complexes 1, 5, and 6 in the range of CO stretching vibrations (1700–2060
cm–1).

The CO vibrations of the carbonyl groups of CpFe(CO)2 (Cp: Cp or Cp*) are very sensitive to charge state of metal
atoms.
Pristine {CpFeI(CO)2}2 and {Cp*FeI(CO)2}2 dimers have two types of the
CO ligands coordinated to iron atoms by the μ- (terminal CO
groups) and the μ2-type (bridged CO groups). Bands
attributed to the CO vibrations are manifested at 1756 and 1771 cm–1 and 1936 and 1956 cm–1 for {CpFeI(CO)2}2 or at 1745 and 1925 cm–1 for {Cp*FeI(CO)2}2.4f,15 The bridged μ2-coordinated CO groups have longer
CO bonds and manifest bands shifted to smaller wavenumbers (1756,
1771, and 1745 cm–1, respectively).4f,15 Such groups are absent in 1–6,
and as a result, the corresponding absorption bands at smaller wavenumbers
disappear in the spectra of 1–6.
Bands of terminal CO groups manifested in the spectra of 1–5 are shifted by 30–50 cm–1 to higher wavenumbers relative to those in the spectra of pristine
{CpFe(CO)2}2 dimers (Cp: Cp or Cp*). Position
of the bands of the CO groups in the spectra of 1–5 are quite close to each other, showing that the charged
state of iron atoms is similar in these complexes. The positions of
these bands are at 1960 and 2013 cm–1 for 1; 1961 and 2013 cm–1 for 2; 1962 and 2008 cm–1 for 5, which
contain the CpFe(CO)2 fragment; 1948 and 1998 cm–1 for 3; and 1958 and 2005 cm–1 for 4, which contain the Cp*Fe(CO)2 fragment. This
can be attributed to the shortening of the CO bonds at the formation
of 1–5, which is confirmed by structural
data (for 1, 2, and 5) and
supports transformation of FeI to FeII at the
formation of 1–5. Position of the
bands attributed to CO stretching modes for 6 with indium
phthalocyanine is different from that of 1–5. The bands are positioned at 1910 and 1969 cm–1 (Figure 3, spectrum
6), and their positions are closer to those in the spectrum of {CpFeI(CO)2}2 (1936 and 1956 cm–1).

2.3 Crystal Structures
Molecular structures
of the coordination of CpFeII(CO)2[SnII(macrocycle•3–)] units (Cp: Cp or Cp*; macrocycle
is Pc, Nc, TPP) in 1–6 are shown
in Figure 4, and geometric
parameters for these units are listed in Table 3. The CpFeII(CO)2 fragments
(Cp: Cp or Cp*) are coordinated to [SnII(macrocycle•3–)] (macrocycle is Pc, Nc, TPP) or [In(Pc2–)] to form Sn–Fe or In–Fe single bonds
of 2.49–2.52 Å length. This provides the displacement
of tin(II) atoms from the 24-atom macrocycle planes by 0.85–1.04
Å at an average length of the Sn–Npyr bonds
of 2.13–2.18 Å. In spite of coordination of an additional
ligand to the tin(II) atoms, the Sn–Npyr bonds are
noticeably shortened in 1–5 and the
displacement from the 24-atom plane decreases in comparison with those
for pristine [SnII(Pc2–)] (1.275 and
2.266(3) Å, respectively).16 Therefore,
coordination of iron atoms to [SnII(macrocycle•3–)]•– stabilizes the Sn–Npyr bonds. An opposite situation is observed for 6. Coordination
of CpFe(CO)2 to [In(Pc2–)] increases
the displacement of indium atoms from the 24-atom Pc plane and elongates
the In–Npyr bonds (1.07 and 2.21 Å for 6 and 0.84 and 2.13 Å for InIIII(Pc2–),18 respectively).19,20

Reduction of the macrocycles from dianionic to radical trianionic
state affects their geometry. Noticeable elongation of the C–Npyr bonds is observed in the radical trianionic state (by 0.02
Å on an average).4e Moreover, alternation
of the C–Nimine (for Pc and Nc)4,5 or
the C–Cmeso bonds (for TPP)14 is also manifested in such a way that four bonds belonging to two
oppositely located isoindole (Pc and Nc) or pyrrole (TPP) units become
short and four other bonds belonging to two other oppositely located
units become long. The difference between average short and long bonds
of 0.03–0.04 Å essentially exceeds the 3σ value,
where σ is the standard deviation in the lengths of these bonds.4,5,14

Geometric parameters of
the macrocycles presented in Table 3 clearly show that they have
the radical trianionic state in 1–5. The C–Npyr bonds are elongated by about 0.02
Å, and alternation of the C–Nimine (Pc and
Nc) or C–Cmeso (TPP) bonds is manifested. The difference
between short and long bonds is in the 0.027–0.032 Å range
(Table 3). Such effects
are absent for pristine phthalocyanines with dianionic macrocycles
since in this case, the C–Npyr bond length is in
the 1.369(3)–1.373(2) Å range and the difference between
short and long C–Nimine and C–Cmeso bonds is from 0 to 0.014 Å (Table 3). The Pc macrocycle in 6 has
dianionic state in contrast to that in 1–5 since the average length of the C–Npyr bonds is 1.375(2) Å and all C–Nimine bonds
have nearly the same length, averaging at 1.337(2) Å. Such geometry
is very close to that in InIIII(Pc2–)
having dianionic Pc2– macrocycle.18

Geometry of the CpFe(CO)2 (Cp: Cp or Cp*)
fragments
was determined for 1–3, 5, and 6 with rather high accuracy (Table 3). Comparison of CpFe(CO)2 geometry (Cp: Cp or Cp*) with formal 0, +1, and +2 charge
on iron atoms shows that the Fe–C(CO) bonds elongate and the
carbonyl CO bonds are shortened in this row (Table 3). The average length of the Fe–C(CO)
and carbonyl CO bonds is about 1.77–1.78 and 1.13–1.14
Å in 1–2 and 5,
respectively. Shortening of the CO bonds is also confirmed by a corresponding
shift of their absorption bands in the IR spectra of 1–5. Such changes indicate the formation of CpFeII(CO)2+ in 1–5 (Table 3).
At the same time, the Fe–C(CO) and CO bonds in 6 are shorter and longer, respectively, in comparison to those in 1–2 and 5. In this case,
they are closer to those in pristine {CpFeI(CO)2}2 dimer (Table 3). No obvious tendencies in bond length changes are observed
for 3.

Generally, cations separate negatively charged
macrocycles in the
salts.4,5 However, the compounds discussed here do
not contain cations, allowing the formation of closely packed π-stacking
dimers or even one-dimensional (1D) chains (Figure 5). Such dimers in 1 are shown
in Figure 5a. The macrocycle
has a nearly planar conformation with a strong deviation of one isoindole
fragment from the molecular plane (the dihedral angle between them
is 16.2°). Macrocycles approach close to each other in dimers
with the interplanar distance of 3.16 Å, and 34 van der Waals
(vdW) C,N···C,N contacts are formed in the 3.13–3.51
Å range. Therefore, effective π–π interaction
between the macrocycles is attained in 1. There are also
several vdW contacts between the macrocycles from the neighboring
dimers of 3.38–3.59 Å. However, those are mainly side-by-side
contacts. Compound 6 is isostructural to 1. In this case, the interplanar distance between two larger planar
parts of the macrocycles within the dimers is 3.20 Å and 26 vdW
contacts are formed (3.34–3.55 Å). Similar π-stacking
dimers are formed in 3. In this case, macrocycles have
a concave shape (Figure S15). However,
this shape still allows close approach of the macrocycles with the
interplanar distance of 3.16 Å and 30 vdW C,N···C,N
contacts of 3.16–3.55 Å. There are two side-by-side C···C
contacts between the macrocycles from the neighboring dimers in 3 of 3.40 Å.

in 1 viewed along the Sn–Fe bond (a) and the Pc
plane (c), complex 6 isostructural to 1;
π-stacking {Cp*FeII(CO)2SnII(Nc•3–)}2 dimers in 4 viewed along the Sn–Fe bond (b) and the Nc planes in the
1D chains consisting of the dimers (d). Bonds for another Pc in the
dimer are shown by gray color. Short vdW C,N···C,N
contacts between the macrocycles are shown by green dashed lines.

Another type of packing is observed
in 2 and 4. Due to a large shift of the
macrocycles in the dimers,
π–π interaction exists not only within the dimers
but also between the macrocycles from the neighboring dimers. This
provides the formation of 1D chains from the macrocycles. The crystal
structure of 2 is shown in Figure S14. The Pc macrocycles contain a planar fragment formed by
two oppositely located isoindole units, and two other isoindole units
are located above and below this planar fragment (the dihedral angles
are 8.2 and 9.6°). The interplanar distance between larger planar
parts of Pc in the dimer is 3.23 Å, and 26 vdW C,N···C,N
contacts are formed (3.28–3.54 Å). Phenylene substituents
of two Pc macrocycles from the neighboring dimers are arranged one
above the other with an interplanar distance of 3.46 Å and a
dihedral angle of only 5.0°. Therefore, π–π
interaction is realized between them to form the 1D chains along the c axis (Figure S14).

Naphthalocyanine
macrocycles have extended π-electron system,
providing effective π–π interaction between them
in 4 (Figure 5b). The interplanar distance in the π-stacking dimers
is 3.22 Å, and more than 40 vdW C,N···C,N contacts
are formed (3.28–3.54 Å, Figure 5b). Due to the essential shift of the Nc
macrocycles in the dimers, π-stacking is also observed between
the macrocycles from the neighboring dimers. The interplanar distance
is 3.44 Å, and the dihedral angle between the planes is 8.6°.
Thus, the 1D chains with effective π–π interactions
are formed along the b axis (Figure 5d).

Porphyrin macrocycle contains four
phenyl substituents rotating
relative to the porphyrin plane that prevents their close approach
to each other in 5. As a result, the shortest interplanar
distance between the porphyrin macrocycles is longer than 4 Å
and no vdW contacts are formed between them. Thus, π–π
interactions between the porphyrin macrocycles are absent in 5 (Figure 6).

2.4 Magnetic
Properties
Magnetic properties
of 1–5 were studied by superconducting
quantum interference device (SQUID) technique and those of 6 by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) only. In the case of 1–4, the temperature dependence of molar
magnetic susceptibility can be fitted well by two contributions from
the Curie impurities (blue curves in Figures S16a–S19a) and the main part of the sample which shows strong antiferromagnetic
coupling of spins (red curves with squares in Figures S16a–S19a).

Curie impurities show a Weiss
temperature close to 0 (from −0.14 to −0.36 K), and
the amount of these impurities was estimated to be from 2.2 (4) to 4.6 (1) % of the S = 1/2
spins per formula unit. Contributions from the Curie impurities were
subtracted from the experimental curves to obtain a contribution from
the main part of the sample. Complexes 1–5 have effective magnetic moments of 1.76 for 1, 1.69 for 2, 1.71 for 3, 1.54 μB for 4, and 1.70 μB for 5 at 300 K (Table 4). Therefore, one S = 1/2 spin per formula
unit is present in 1–5. The formula
unit contains one coordination unit, but there are donor and acceptor
parts in these units and spin and electron density can be transferred
from a donor iron-containing ligand to the macrocycle. Optical and
structural data show that the radical trianionic macrocycles are formed
in 1–5, which have the S = 1/2 spin state. The FeII atoms formed at such electron
transfer are diamagnetic like those in ferrocene and do not contribute
to magnetic susceptibility of 1–5. The effective π–π interactions of the macrocycles
in the dimers or the 1D chains allow one to suppose strong magnetic
coupling between spins in 1–4. It
should be noted that in the absence of such charge transfer and localization
of the S = 1/2 spins on the iron(I) atoms, the shortest
iron–iron distances (>10 Å) are too long to realize
effective
magnetic coupling between spins.

For fitting of molar
magnetic susceptibility data for 1–4, we used the equations derived from the S = 1/2
antiferromagnetic exchange Heisenberg Hamiltonian22  where Jij is the exchange interaction between two spins, Si and Sj, and the summation operation is performed
over unique
exchange bonds. Additionally, the S = 1/2 antiferromagnetic
alternating-exchange Heisenberg chain Hamiltonian23 was used to describe the magnetic behavior of 2 and 4  where
α is the alternation parameter,
α ≡ J2/J1, 0 ≤ α ≤ 1, and J1 ≤ J2 ≤ 0.

π-Stacking dimers are formed in 1 and 3, and in these cases, magnetic behavior can be approximated
well by the Heisenberg model for isolated pairs of antiferromagnetically
interacting spins22 with exchange interactions
of −78 K for 1 (Figure 7a) and −85 K for 3 (Figure 8a). At low temperatures
(4.2–80 K), these dimers transfer to the diamagnetic state
due to the antiparallel arrangement of spins. Temperature dependencies
of reciprocal molar magnetic susceptibility are linear in the 150–300
K range, allowing Weiss temperatures to be determined as −38
K for 1 (Figure 7b) and −70 K for 3 (Figure 8b). Thus, magnetic data show that two spins
in the dimers are strongly antiferromagnetically coupled. Previously,
rather strong magnetic coupling of spins was observed in several π-stacking
{M(Pc•3–)}2 dimers where M is
TiIVO, VIVO, or Ph5CpRu(CO)2SnII.4d−4f

molar magnetic susceptibility (b, d) for polycrystalline 1 and 2, respectively. The dependencies are fitted by
the Heisenberg models for isolated pairs of antiferromagnetically
interacting spins22 with J/kB = −78 K (red curve) for 1 (a) and for S = 1/2 spin chains with strong
intradimer Jintra/kB = −54 K and weaker interdimer exchange interactions Jinter/kB = −6
K (red curve)23 for 2 (c).

Figure 8 Temperature dependencies of molar magnetic susceptibility ((a,
c) the contribution of the Curie impurities is subtracted) and reciprocal
molar magnetic susceptibility (b, d) for polycrystalline 3 and 4, respectively. The dependencies are fitted by
the Heisenberg models for isolated pairs of antiferromagnetically
interacting spins22 with J/kB = −85 K (red curve) for 3 (a) and S = 1/2 spin chains with strong
intradimer Jintra/kB = −170 K and weaker interdimer exchange interactions Jinter/kB = −40
K (red curve)23 for 4 (c).

In 2 and 4, the radical trianionic Pc•3– or Nc•3– macrocycles
are packed in alternating-exchange 1D chains. To fit the data accurately,
the model with two exchange parameters was used. Being a superposition
of two equations, the first one describes an antiferromagnetically
coupled dimer with S = 1/2 (Jintra) and the second one focuses on the S = 1/2 spin exchange between the dimers (Jinter).24  where the
χintra(T) term is given by the Bleaney–Bowers
equation,
which is a second-order approximation of the van Vleck expression.25 Magnetic susceptibilities of such spin chains
were previously discussed in a thorough manner and parameterized by
Johnston et al. using a Padé approximant.26

Fitting (eq 1, page S16
in the Supporting
Information) of the data for 2 shows that intradimer
exchange interaction (Jintra/kB = −54 K) is essentially larger than the exchange
interaction between the spins from the neighboring dimers (Jinter/kB = −6
K) (Figure 7c). Fitting
of the data solely by the dimer model, however, shows much worse correspondence
between experimental and theoretical curves. The Weiss temperature
estimated in the 150–300 K range is −39 K (Figure 7d).

The strongest
magnetic coupling is realized in 4 with
the Nc•3– radical trianions packed in 1D
chains (Figure 5d).
The effective magnetic moment of 4 is 1.54 μB, and this value is lower than that expected for the system
with one noninteracting S = 1/2 spin (1.73 μB). Magnetic moment decreases even below 300 K (Figure S19b) due to strong antiferromagnetic
coupling. This is also the reason why magnetic moment of 4 is lower than the expected value of 1.73 μB. By
fitting the magnetic susceptibility data for 4, one obtained
the intradimer exchange interaction of Jintra/kB = −170 K and interdimer exchange
interaction of Jinter/kB = −40 K (Figure 8c). It is seen that both intra- and interdimer exchange
interactions for the Nc•3– radical trianions
in 4 have large values. Reciprocal molar magnetic susceptibility
is linear in the 240–300 K range, allowing the Weiss temperature
to be determined approximately as −307 K (Figure 8d). This is one of the strongest
magnetic couplings observed in the compounds with negatively charged
metal macrocycles. Both complexes 2 and 4 are first examples of alternating-exchange 1D chains from the radical
trianionic macrocycles. Previously, mainly π-stacking dimers4d,4e or the 2D layers4c were studied.

There are no π–π interactions between the tetraphenylporphyrin
radical trianions in {CpFeII(CO)2[SnII(TPP•3–)]} (5) (Figure 6). As a result, magnetic properties
of 5 are different from those of 1–4. Effective magnetic moment of 5 is 1.70 μB at 300 K, indicating the contribution of one noninteracting S = 1/2 spin per formula unit. Spins are only weakly coupled
antiferromagnetically with a Weiss temperature of −5 K (Figure S20).

Complex 6 is
EPR-silent in the 4.1–295 K range.
This agrees well with the presence of diamagnetic and EPR-silent dianionic
Pc2– macrocycles whose formation was confirmed by
optical and X-ray diffraction data. At the same time, it was found
that position of the bands of the CO vibrations and geometry of metal
fragments in 6 are rather close to those in {CpFeI(CO)2}2. In this case, unusual InII should be present and both metal FeI and InII ions should be paramagnetic. However, a diamagnetic product
can form at the formation of the In–Fe σ bond. Another
most probable situation is that charge transfer from FeI is realized to the indium atoms and diamagnetic FeII and
InI ions are formed as a result. The InI state
is more common for the indium atoms, and in this case, both metal
ions are diamagnetic, as observed. Diamagnetic Fe0 and
InIII cannot be formed in 6 because the CpFe0(CO)2– anion is an extremely
strong reductant27 and cannot coexist together
with the acceptor Pc2– macrocycle.

3 Conclusions
A series of complexes was obtained in which
the CpFe(CO)2 fragments (Cp: Cp or Cp*) are coordinated
to tin(II) macrocycles
or indium phthalocyanine. Charge transfer from the donor metal fragments
to the acceptor tin(II) macrocycles is realized, providing intramolecular
charge separation and the formation of diamagnetic CpFeII(CO)2 (Cp: Cp or Cp*) and paramagnetic radical trianions
of the macrocycles. These complexes can be considered neutral radicals.
Paramagnetic macrocycles are packed in the dimers or the alternating-exchange
1D chains with effective π–π interaction between
the macrocycles providing strong magnetic coupling of spins with larger
exchange interaction within the dimers (J/kB from −38 to −170 K) as well
as between the dimers in the case of 4 (J/kB = −40 K). Effective π–π
interaction between the macrocycles is important for the realization
of strong magnetic coupling between π-electrons. Because of
this, the disruption of these interactions in 5 with
tetraphenylporphyrin radical trianions suppresses magnetic coupling
of spins. In the case of indium phthalocyanine, indium atoms are reduced
most probably instead of the Pc macrocycles. Diamagnetism observed
in 6 can be explained by the presence of diamagnetic
dianionic Pc2– macrocycles and diamagnetic Fe and
In atoms. Molecules with intrinsic intramolecular charge transfer
are promising components for development of single-component magnetic
and probably conducting materials. These molecules can easily be obtained
by mixing components, and their range can be extended by using different
macrocyclic compounds of tin, germanium, indium, gallium, and other
metals. Transition-metal fragments containing cyclopentadienyl and
carbonyl ligands can also be varied (MoI, RuI, VI, and other metals) to introduce different paramagnetic
metal atoms into such molecules. This work is now in progress.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Tin(II)
phthalocyanine
(SnIIPc), and tin(IV) phthalocyanine dichloride (SnIVCl2Pc) were purchased from TCI. Tin(II) naphthalocyanine
(SnIINc), indium(III) phthalocyanine chloride (InIIIClPc, >95%), tetraphenylporphyrin (H2TPP, >99%),
and anhydrous
tin(II) dichloride (SnIICl2, 99.99%) were purchased
from Aldrich. Cyclopentadienyl iron(I) dicarbonyl dimer, {CpFe(CO)2}2, pentamethylcyclopentadienyl iron(I) dicarbonyl
dimer, {Cp*Fe(CO)2}2, and decamethylchromocene
(Cp*2Cr) were purchased from Strem. SnIVCl2TPP was obtained from H2TPP and SnIICl2, as described.28 Solvents
were purified in argon atmosphere. o-Dichlorobenzene
(C6H4Cl2) was distilled over CaH2 under reduced pressure, and hexane was distilled over Na/benzophenone.
Compounds 1–6 were synthesized and stored in an
MBraun 150B-G glovebox with a controlled atmosphere containing less
than 1 ppm of water and oxygen. Solvents were degassed and stored
in the glovebox, and the KBr pellets used for the IR and UV–visible–NIR
analyses were prepared in the glovebox. EPR and SQUID measurements
were performed on polycrystalline samples of 1–6 sealed in 2 mm quartz tubes at ambient inert pressure.

4.2 Synthesis
Crystals of 1–6 were obtained by diffusion technique. A reaction
mixture in o-dichlorobenzene was filtered into a
1.8 cm diameter, 50 mL glass tube with a ground glass plug, and then
30 mL of n-hexane was layered over the solution.
Slow mixing of the o-dichlorobenzene solution with n-hexane resulted in precipitation of crystals over 1–2
months. The solvent was then decanted from the crystals, and they
were washed with n-hexane. The composition of the
obtained complexes was determined from X-ray diffraction analysis
on single crystals. Due to high air sensitivity of 1–6, elemental analysis could not be used to determine the composition
because the complexes reacted with oxygen in the air before the quantitative
oxidation procedure could be performed.

Complex CpFe(CO)2[SnIIPc] (phases 1 and 2) was obtained via the reaction of SnIIPc (26.6 mg, 0.042
mmol) with large excess of the {CpFe(CO)2}2 dimers
(36 mg, 0.102 mmol) in o-dichlorobenzene by stirring
the solution at 80 °C during 8 h. Phthalocyanine was completely
dissolved to form a deep blue solution characteristic of Pc•3–. This solution was cooled down to room temperature (RT) and filtered
into a tube for diffusion. Slow mixing with n-hexane
yielded the crystals of two phases (1 and 2). The two phases were separated under a microscope depending on
the shape and color of the crystals: right hexagonal prisms of dark
violet color with copper luster for 1 and oblique hexagonal
prisms of nearly black color without any luster for 2. The crystals were obtained in 36 and 18% yield, respectively. The
crystals of phase 1 can also be obtained via the reaction
of SnIVCl2Pc (29.3 mg, 0.042 mmol) with a large
excess of the {CpFe(CO)2}2 dimers (36 mg, 0.102
mmol) in o-dichlorobenzene by stirring the solution
at 80 °C for 8 h. Phthalocyanine completely dissolved to form
a deep blue solution characteristic of Pc•3–. In this case, the crystals of phase 1 were obtained
exclusively as right hexagonal prisms of dark violet color with copper
luster (62% yield).

Complex Cp*Fe(CO)2[SnIIPc]·C6H4Cl2 (3) was obtained similarly
via the reaction of SnIIPc (26.6 mg, 0.042 mmol) with an
excess of the {Cp*Fe(CO)2}2 dimers (28.5 mg,
0.065 mmol) in o-dichlorobenzene. The crystals were
obtained as black blocks in 56% yield.

Complex Cp*Fe(CO)2[SnIINc]·2C6H4Cl2 (4) was obtained by the
dissolution of SnIINc (34.6 mg, 0.042 mmol) in the presence
of an excess of the {Cp*Fe(CO)2}2 dimers (28.5
mg, 0.065 mmol) in o-dichlorobenzene by stirring
the solution at 80 °C during 8 h. Naphthalocyanine completely
dissolved to form a deep green solution characteristic of Nc•3–. The solution was subsequently cooled down to RT and filtered into
a tube for diffusion. Crystals of 4 were obtained as
black blocks in 42% yield.

Complex CpFe(CO)2[SnIITPP] (5) was obtained by dissolution of SnIVCl2TPP
(33.5 mg, 0.042 mmol) in the presence of two equivalents of Cp*2Cr (27 mg, 0.084 mmol) as a reductant and a large excess of
the {CpFe(CO)2}2 dimers (36 mg, 0.102 mmol)
in o-dichlorobenzene by stirring the solution at
80 °C during 8 h. Porphyrin completely dissolved and the color
of the solution changed from green to red. The solution was cooled
down to RT and filtered into a tube for diffusion. Crystals of 5 were obtained as elongated parallelepipeds with a blue luster
characteristic of porphyrins (67% yield).

Complex CpFe(CO)2[InPc] (6) was obtained
by dissolution of InIIIClPc (27.6 mg, 0.042 mmol) in the
presence of 1 equiv of Cp*2Cr (13.5 mg, 0.042 mmol) as
reductant and a large excess of {CpFe(CO)2}2 (36 mg, 0.102 mmol) in o-dichlorobenzene by stirring
the solution at 80 °C for 8 h. Phthalocyanine completely dissolved
to form a deep blue solution at the beginning, but the color changed
to deep green after several hours. It was cooled down to RT and filtered
into a tube for diffusion. Crystals of 6 were obtained
as black blocks with copper luster (31% yield).

4.3 General
UV–visible–NIR
spectra were measured in KBr pellets on a PerkinElmer Lambda 1050
spectrometer in the 250–2500 nm range. Fourier transform infrared
spectra were obtained in KBr pellets with a PerkinElmer Spectrum 400
spectrometer (400–7800 cm–1). EPR spectra
were recorded for sealed polycrystalline samples of 6 in the 4–295 K temperature range with a JEOL JES-TE 200 X-band
ESR spectrometer equipped with a JEOL ES-CT470 cryostat. A Quantum
Design MPMS-XL SQUID magnetometer was used to measure static magnetic
susceptibility of 1–5 at 100 mT magnetic
field in cooling and heating conditions in the 300–1.9 K range.
A sample holder contribution and core temperature-independent diamagnetic
susceptibility (χd) were subtracted from the experimental
values. The χd values were estimated by the extrapolation
of the data in the high-temperature range (150–300 K for 1–3 and 240–300 K for 4, 20–300 K for 5) by fitting the data with the
following expression: χM = C/(T – Θ) + χd, where C is the Curie constant and Θ is the Weiss temperature. Effective magnetic moments (μeff) were calculated with the formula: μeff = (8·χM·T)1/2.

4.4 X-ray Crystal Structure Determination
X-ray diffraction data for 1–6 are
listed in Table 5.
X-ray diffraction data for 1, 2, 5, and 6 were collected on an Oxford diffraction “Gemini-R”
charge-coupled device (CCD) diffractometer with graphite-monochromated
Mo Kα radiation using an Oxford Instrument Cryojet system. Raw
data reduction to F2 was carried out using
CrysAlisPro, Oxford Diffraction Ltd.29 X-ray
diffraction data for 3 and 4 were collected
on a Bruker Smart Apex II CCD diffractometer with graphite-monochromated
Mo Kα radiation using a Japan Thermal Engineering Co. cooling
system DX-CS190LD. Raw data reduction to F2 was performed using Bruker SAINT.30 The
structures were solved by a direct method and refined by the full-matrix
least-squares method against F2 using
SHELX 2013 (1, 2) and 2016/631 and Olex232 (3–6). Nonhydrogen atoms were refined in
the anisotropic approximation. Positions of hydrogen atoms were calculated
geometrically.

The structure of 3 contains half of an
independent
solvent C6H4Cl2 molecule, which is
disordered between two orientations with the 0.3700(15)/0.1300(15)
occupancies. One of the two independent solvent C6H4Cl2 molecules is disordered in 4 between
three orientations with the 0.278(3)/0.230(3)/0.492(3) occupancies.
The CpFe(CO)2 fragment is disordered in the crystal structure
of 5 between two orientations with the 0.8823(14)/0.1177(14)
occupancies. One of the four phenyl substituents of TPP is rotationally
disordered between two orientations with the 0.890(5)/0.110(5) occupancies.
To keep the geometry of the disordered solvent molecules close to
that of the ideal one, bond length restraints were applied along with
the next-neighbor distances using the SADI SHELXL instruction. To
keep the anisotropic thermal parameters of the atoms of the disordered
molecules within reasonable limits, the displacement components were
restrained using ISOR and DELU SHELXL instructions. This results in
156, 699,and 356 restraints used for the refinement of the crystal
structures of 3–5, respectively.
