Transparent, superhydrophilic materials are indispensable
for their
self-cleaning function, which has become an increasingly popular research
topic, particularly in photovoltaic (PV) applications. Here, we report
hydrophilic and superhydrophilic ZnO by varying the morphology for
use as a self-cleaning coating for PV applications. Three different
ZnO microstructures, such as ZnO nanorods (R-ZnO), ZnO microflowers
(F-ZnO), and ZnO microspheres (M-ZnO), were developed by hydrothermal
methods. The surface morphology by using X-ray diffraction (XRD),
wettability behavior by using water contact angle (WCA) measurements,
structural and optical properties by using photoluminescence (PL),
Raman, and UV–vis spectrophotometry, and defect estimation
by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of the ZnO nanostructured
films were systematically investigated. XRD confirmed the formation
of the hexagonal wurtzite structure of ZnO. The average crystallite
sizes of prepared R-ZnO, F-ZnO, and M-ZnO were found to be 28.95,
11.19, and 41.5 nm, respectively. The band gap values of ZnO nanostructures
were calculated from the UV–vis absorption spectrum and found
to be 3.6, 3.3, and 3.1 eV for R-ZnO, F-ZnO, and M-ZnO, respectively.
The WCAs for R-ZnO and F-ZnO were 20.2 and 11.19°, respectively,
while M-ZnO behaved like a superhydrophilic material having a WCA
of 2.8°.

1 Introduction
Deposited dust or organic
contaminants on photovoltaic (PV) glass
covers reduce solar photon flux reaching a PV cell via spectral absorption
and reflection losses. This optical loss reduces PV power that can
vary between 2 and 50% depending on local climate, dust composition,
dust particle concentration, surface morphology of PV glass, and employed
dust mitigation techniques.1,2 Prominent dust impact
on the PV module is found in arid or semiarid areas, such as the Middle
East and North Africa, and in the most cleaned area U.K., up to 5%
soiling losses are possible due to dust accumulation. PV installed
capacity in the world is likely to be more than doubled in a few years,
and PV is installed faster than any other renewable energy technologies.
Thus, the effect of dust deposition to improve the PV system efficiency
is significant.

Manual, automated, electrostatic, electrodynamic,
and self-cleaning
are the different applied techniques to clean a soiled PV device.
Except for self-cleaning, other types are time-consuming, costly,
and hazardous to the environment and corrode the solar panel frame.3 Two different self-cleaning methods are presently
available, which include photocatalytic hydrophilic and hydrophobic
types.4 The hydrophobic coated surface
shows a water contact angle (WCA) ≥ 90° and low surface
energy, while the hydrophilic coated surface shows a water contact
angle ≤ 90° and high surface energy.5 A water contact angle (WCA) greater than 150° shows
superhydrophobic properties, whereas a WCA less than 5° shows
superhydrophilic properties6,7 Suspended water, dirt,
or any pollutant rolls down spontaneously due to the nonequilibrium
thermodynamic state from a superhydrophobic surface.4,8,9 They are also capable of reducing
the formation of corrosion and ice and drag reduction. On the other
hand, a hydrophilic or a superhydrophilic surface spreads water droplets
to form a film throughout itself, thereby allowing light waves to
pass through and diminish any pollutants through a photocatalysis
reaction. For antisoiling purpose, the superhydrophilic surface provides
2.5 times higher efficiency than the superhydrophobic coating.10,11 The wetting behavior of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic coatings
is a combined effect of its surface topography and microstructure,
surface free energy, and the chemical composition. Semiconductive
metal oxide has the ability to be used as a self-cleaning coating.

Zinc oxide is one of the important semiconductors, often selected
as a doped material due to its wide band gap of 3.37 eV with a large
excitation binding energy of 60 meV, low cost, nontoxicity, and optical
and photochemical properties. ZnO surfaces display better photocatalytic
performance in the degradation of hazardous dye molecules in both
basic and acidic media. Also, ZnO is bio-safe and biocompatible and
thus acts as an environmentally benign coating.12 Zinc oxide has been extensively investigated due to its
promising applications in short-wavelength lasing; gas sensors;13 catalysts;14 PV cells;15 transparent conductors;16 and piezoelectric materials,17 photodiodes,18 transistors,19 and
varistors.20 ZnO nanostructures have been
synthesized in different morphologies such as nanowire arrays,21,22 nanorods,23 nanotubes, nanoflowers, and
nanosheets24 using physical and chemical
methods for self-cleaning applications. Various techniques have been
utilized to prepare ZnO nanostructured films for self-cleaning applications
such as magnetron sputtering,25 spray pyrolysis,
thermal oxidation, reactive evaporation,22 vapor phase epitaxy, electrodeposition, sol–gel method,26 solid-state reaction, and chemical deposition.27 However, to support the high demand for low-cost
mass production of hydrophobic/hydrophilic ZnO nanostructured surfaces
for PV applications, a hydrothermal process is efficient. ZnO nanostructures
prepared by hydrothermal methods have excellent crystalline quality,
high surface area, chemical and thermal stability, low growth temperature,
and are environmentally safe (water used as a solvent) with a strong
possibility of scaling up.26

The
surface of ZnO can be hydrophobic or hydrophilic depending
upon the physical and chemical properties of ZnO/water interfacial
interactions. ZnO is introduced to prepare a superhydrophobic, with
a WCA of 158° and a sliding angle of about 6°, Zn coating
on a steel substrate.24 The ZnO hydrophobic
coating was prepared on borosilicate glass, amorphous quartz, single-crystal
sapphire, lanthanum aluminate, and yttria-stabilized zirconia substrates
using thermal evaporation methods,22 which
are also suitable for mechanical and oxidation resistance applications.
A flexible self-cleaning nanofiber membrane using an oleic acid-coated
ZnO nanowire structure had WCA > 150°, which closely resembled
the nanoscale tubular randomly oriented crystalloids on a lotus leaf.21

Pesika et al. reported that the surface
of a ZnO single-crystal
is relatively hydrophilic.28 Photocatalytic
self-cleaning ZnO on cellulosic fibers was prepared by an ambient
temperature sol–gel process.26 A
composite ZnO/TiO2 film possesses superhydrophilicity with
a water contact angle of less than 5° without UV irradiation.29

Switching wettability by the transformation
between the oxygen-vacant
state (hydrophobic) and the oxygen-rich state (hydrophilic) is possible
with ZnO.30 Using hydrothermal method,
prepared ZnO nanorod array film showed hydrophilic (water contact
angle of 9.6) nature which became superhydrophobic (water contact
angle of 156.2) after being exposed to octa decanethiol solution23 ZnO shows hydrophobicity and superhydrophobicity
at normal conditions, which can be UV-cured to obtain hydrophilic
properties31

The surface roughness
of hydrophobic and superhydrophobic surfaces
can limit the transparency of that surface. Surface roughness is higher
than one-quarter of a wavelength of a visible hindrance to achieving
transparency in visible light.32−34 However, for PV applications,
a transparent self-cleaning coating is paramount.

In this contribution,
we describe a facile synthesis of morphologically
varied hydrophilic and superhydrophilic ZnO microstructures without
UV treatment for self-cleaning techniques of PV and glazing applications.
ZnO microflowers (F-Zno), nanorods (R-Zno), and microspheres (M-Zno)
were developed on an ITO glass substrate.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Morphological Analysis
The X-ray
diffraction (XRD) profile of as-prepared samples is presented in Figure 1, which revealed
that all of the diffraction peaks are indexed to the hexagonal wurtzite
structure of ZnO (space group P63mc, JCPDS card number 36-1451), ensuring its identity. The sharp diffraction
peaks indicate good crystallinity. Using Scherrer’s equation , the crystallite sizes of R-ZnO, F-ZnO,
and M-ZnO were calculated to be 41.5, 28.95, and 11.19 nm, respectively.

Figure 1 XRD pattern
of as-synthesized samples of ZnO: (a) nanorods (R-ZnO),
(b) flowerlike structures (F-ZnO), and (c) porous microspheres (M-ZnO).

Figure 2a–c
displays the field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) micrographs
of the three different morphologies of as-prepared ZnO microstructures.
The FESEM analysis revealed that the growth of as-grown nanorods R-ZnO,
rod assembled flowerlike structures F-ZnO, and porous microspheres
M-ZnO can be varied by merely changing the surfactant, hydrothermal
reaction conditions, and calcination process. ZnO has a tendency to
form rods as the growth is dominated unidirectionally, thereby forming
rod-shaped morphology of ZnO (Figure 2a). Cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) on the
other hand behaves not only as a growth promoter but also as a soft
template for the formation of flowerlike morphology of ZnO by providing
active sites (CTAB-conjugated growth units) along the circumference
of ZnO nuclei, which help in the adsorption of growth units and altering
its surface energy, eventually allowing the low-temperature radial
growth of uniformly distributed F-ZnO microstructures (Figure 2b). The uniformly distributed
individual crystalline nanorods were ∼1 μm long with
an average diameter of 20 nm. The flowerlike sample has a diameter
ranging from 2 μm. By changing the surfactant to urea with subsequent
calcination of the zinc hydroxide carbonate (ZHC) precursor, ZnO microspheres
were formed with highly porous nanosheets. The decomposition of ZHC
resulted in evaporation of H2O and CO2 during
calcination, resulting in the formation of ZnO with a porous surface
(Figure 2c). All three
samples maintained their morphologies even after undergoing aging
with postannealing at 350 °C on a glass substrate as shown in Figure 2d–f.

and after annealing at 350 °C (d) R-ZnO, (e) F-ZnO, and (f) M-ZnO

2.2 Wettability Property by Contact Angle Measurements
and Optical Property Analysis
The images obtained for determination
of the water contact angle (WCA) along with the shape of water droplets
formed on the surface are shown in detail in Figure 3 for R-ZnO, F-ZnO, and M-ZnO. The WCA was
found to be 20.2, 11.19, and 2.8° for surfaces with R-ZnO, F-ZnO,
and M-ZnO, respectively. All contact angles were measured with a 5
μL water droplet at ambient temperature. The results clearly
indicate hydrophilic surfaces for rods and superhydrophilicity in
the cases of flower- and microsphere-assembled surfaces. These results
could arise due to the crystallinity and microstructural changes that
occur by the synthesis of these microstructures. Due to the abundance
in the number of troughs between the microstructures, the surface’s
roughness is increased, and the wettability is largely affected, thereby
following Wenzel’s model.

coming into contact with the surface and after coming into contact

(F-ZnO), and (d) porous microspheres (M-ZnO).

2.3 Optical Property Analysis
The optical
transmission and absorption behavior of different ZnO morphologies
fabricated on a glass substrate was observed by using UV–vis–near
infrared (NIR) spectroscopy analysis as shown in Figure 4. Band gaps of R-ZnO, F-ZnO,
and M-ZnO were obtained by calculation from the Tauc plot as 3.6,
3.3, and 3.1 eV. The slight shifting in band gap arises due to changes
in morphologies, defects, and grain sizes. It was clearly hinted that
the morphology of the microstructures could efficiently control the
transmittance, absorbance, and optical band gap. Reduced band gap
can enhance its electrical property, thereby decreasing resistance. V0 acts as an electron donor, forming acceptor
states near the valence band. When the concentration of the V0 is high enough, V0 states overlap
with the valence band, pushing it upward toward the conduction band.
With an increase in V0, there is an increase
in the number of energy states above the valence band and hence an
increase in the band gap narrowing. Thus, in our case, various morphologies
of ZnO display different energy band gap values because they have
different concentrations of V0.

spectra, (b) absorbance spectra, and band gaps
(c–e) of M-ZnO, R-ZnO, and F-ZnO.

2.4 X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) Analysis
for Defect Estimation
XPS analysis is further done to determine
the presence of surface defects. Figure 5 demonstrates the comparison of the O 1s
region of the XPS spectra of various morphologies of ZnO: (a) R-ZnO,
(b) M-ZnO, and (c) F-ZnO. Previous studies have reported that the
peak around ∼530.05 eV (O1) is due to oxygen in the Zn-O matrix
and the peaks centered around ∼531.06 to ∼531.58 eV
(O2) generally originate from the surface defects in the
ZnO structure especially oxygen vacancies. After Gaussian fitting
of peaks for each sample, the total areal percentage clearly indicated
that the presence of defects arising from the oxygen vacancies in
ZnO porous microspheres (58.2%) is the highest as compared to flowerlike
ZnO (32.2%) and ZnO nanorods (20.2%). This result confirms the proposed
reason for higher wettability in porous microspheres than in flower
and rod morphologies.

morphologies

3 Conclusions
We report self-cleaning
microsphere ZnO (M-ZnO), nanorod ZnO (R-ZnO),
and flower ZnO (F-ZnO) morphologies developed by a hydrothermal process
on a glass substrate at ambient conditions for antisoiling of PV applications.
The structural and morphological properties were studied by X-ray
diffraction (XRD) and field-emission scanning electron microscopy
(FESEM). The optical and wetting properties were investigated by UV–vis
spectrophotometry and water contact angle measurement, respectively.
Stable morphologies were obtained even after performing aging with
postannealing at 350 °C on the glass substrate. Single-crystal
rods had a diameter of 20 nm, which changed to 5–7 μm
for flow structures. M-ZnO behaved as a superhydrophilic material
as it had a WCA of 2.8°, which was the lowest compared to R-ZnO
and F-ZnO having WCAs of 20.2 and 11.19°, respectively. M-ZnO
had a band gap of 3.1 eV and more than 80% average visible (380–780
nm) transparency. Hydrophilic R-ZnO and F-ZnO had optical band gaps
of 3.6 and 3.3 eV, respectively, which support their use in self-cleaning
applications.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Material Synthesis
4.1.1 Synthesis of ZnO Rods (R-ZnO) and Flowerlike
Structures (F-ZnO)
All chemicals were of analytical grade
and were used as purchased (Sigma-Aldrich) without any further purification
process.

For the synthesis of flowerlike ZnO microstructures
(F-ZnO), 50 mL of a transparent solution of Zn (NO3)2.H2O (0.2 M) was steadily added to 50 mL of a transparent
solution of 1.2 M NaOH and 0.01 M CTAB under vigorous stirring in
an ice bath for 1 h. The resulting solution was transferred in a 100
mL capacity autoclave with a Teflon liner and maintained at 90 °C
for 5 h. After the hydrothermal reaction was complete, the autoclave
was allowed to cool down to room temperature. The white precipitate
obtained was harvested by centrifugation and then thoroughly washed
with distilled water and ethanol several times. The final white product
was dried at 80 °C in air for 10 h. The same experiment as mentioned
above was repeated for the synthesis of ZnO microrods (R-ZnO) in the
absence of CTAB.

For the synthesis of ZnO microspheres, a hydrothermal
reaction
with subsequent calcination was conducted. In a typical synthesis
process, optimized amounts of Zn (NO3)2.H2O, urea (CO(NH2)2), and trisodium citrate
(Na3C6H5O7) in a ratio
of 1:1:0.1 were steadily dissolved in 100 mL of deionized water under
vigorous stirring to form a transparent solution. The resulting mixture
was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and
maintained at a hydrothermal temperature of 120 °C for 5 h. After
the hydrothermal reaction was complete, the autoclave was allowed
to cool down to room temperature. The precipitate was harvested by
centrifugation and was washed thoroughly with deionized water and
ethanol several times. The obtained white precipitate was dried at
80 °C in air for 10 h to obtain zinc hydroxide carbonate (ZHC)
precursors. Furthermore, for the synthesis of porous ZnO microspheres,
the as-obtained ZHC precursors were calcined at 500 °C in a chemical
vapor deposition (CVD) furnace for 2 h. After cooling the system to
room temperature, the final product was collected. Details of the
growth and formation mechanism of nanorods, flowerlike structures,
and porous microspheres of ZnO are shown in Figure 6.

(b) flowerlike structures,
and (c) microspheres.

4.2 Development of ZnO Microstructure Thin Films
The deposition of the ZnO microstructures onto a glass substrate
was carried out by using the drop-casting method. Before applying
the material, the glass substrates were carefully washed for 50 mins
in boiling diluted sulfuric acid (1:10 v/v) and rinsed thoroughly
with deionized water, acetone, and ethanol several times. The as-prepared
ZnO samples were dissolved in DI water (0.5 wt %) and ultrasonicated,
and finally, the solution was drop-cast onto the surface of the glass
substrate placed on a hot plate (100 °C). The film was dried
by evaporating out the solvent and was subjected to postannealing
at 350 °C for 2 h. After completing the fabrication of the device,
it was subjected to various characterization techniques.

4.3 Material Characterization
The crystal
phases of the materials were determined by X-ray powder diffraction
(XRD) using a Bruker D8 ADVANCE diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation
and were matched with the standard values using the Joint Committee
on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS) database. The morphology of
the sample was obtained using JSM-7600F JEOL field-emission scanning
electron microscopy (FESEM). Raman spectroscopy analysis was carried
out to evaluate structural defects and various modes in the prepared
sample, and the spectrum was recorded using an Alpha 300 M confocal
micro-Raman spectrometer equipped with a YAG laser (532 nm). Furthermore,
the optical properties were analyzed by studying the photoluminescence
(PL) spectrum recorded at room temperature using a fluorimeter (FS-2,
Scinco) equipped with a Xe-arc lamp having an excitation wavelength
of 350 nm. UV–Vis spectroscopy analysis was carried out to
evaluate the band gap and the transmission properties of the prepared
samples with the help of a LAMBDA 1050 UV/vis/NIR spectrophotometer.
Finally, to understand the wettability property of these materials
and surface energy, which is an essential parameter for self-cleaning
application in solar panels, contact angle measurement was conducted by using a contact angle meter (optical tensiometer).
