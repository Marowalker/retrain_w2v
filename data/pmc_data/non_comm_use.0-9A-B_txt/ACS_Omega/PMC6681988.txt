Vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) is the major regulating
factor for the formation of new blood vessels, also known as angiogenesis.
VEGF is often incorporated in synthetic scaffolds to promote vascularization
and to enhance the survival of cells that have been seeded in these
devices. Such applications require sustained local delivery of VEGF
of around 4 weeks for stable blood vessel formation. Most delivery
systems for VEGF only provide short-term release for a couple of days,
followed by a release phase with very low VEGF release. We now have
developed VEGF-loaded polymeric microspheres that provide sustained
release of bioactive VEGF for 4 weeks. Blends of two swellable poly(ε-caprolactone)–poly(ethylene
glycol)–poly(ε-caprolactone)-b-poly(l-lactide) ([PCL–PEG–PCL]-b-[PLLA])-based
multiblock copolymers with different PEG content and PEG molecular
weight were used to prepare the microspheres. Loading of the microspheres
was established by a solvent evaporation-based membrane emulsification
method. The resulting VEGF-loaded microspheres had average sizes of
40–50 μm and a narrow size distribution. Optimized formulations
of a 50:50 blend of the two multiblock copolymers had an average VEGF
loading of 0.79 ± 0.09%, representing a high average VEGF loading
efficiency of 78 ± 16%. These microspheres released VEGF continuously
over 4 weeks in phosphate-buffered saline pH 7.4 at 37 °C. This
release profile was preserved after repeated and long-term storage
at −20 °C for up to 9 months, thereby demonstrating excellent
storage stability. VEGF release was governed by diffusion through
the water-filled polymer matrix, depending on PEG molecular weight
and PEG content of the polymers. The bioactivity of the released VEGF
was retained within the experimental error in the 4-week release window,
as demonstrated using a human umbilical vein endothelial cells proliferation
assay. Thus, the microspheres prepared in this study are suitable
for embedment in polymeric scaffolds with the aim of promoting their
functional vascularization.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Tissue
engineering aims at developing bioartificial implants which
can be used for replacement or repair of damaged tissues.1−3 Different categories of such engineered tissues can be distinguished:
full synthetic biomaterials, (decellularized) scaffolds from natural
origins, and hybrid biomaterials that consist of both synthetic and
biological or cellular components.4−6 When the implanted material
contains cells or when it will be infiltrated by cells after it has
been transplanted, one can consider such biomaterial as an artificial
tissue or organ.7 One of the major challenges
of constructing cellularized biomaterials is the sufficient supply
of nutrients and oxygen from the systemic circulation into the implant.8 Incorporation of growth factors into the tissue-engineered
construct can locally stimulate angiogenesis towards the implant,
thereby providing vascularization of the construct.9,10 Vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is the most prominent pro-angiogenic
growth factor and stimulates angiogenesis by binding to the VEGF receptor
present on endothelial cells.11 Stable
vascularization of an implant depends on the dose of VEGF and the
time period of VEGF release at the site of implantation.10,12 The current literature suggests that a constant dose of VEGF for
around 4 weeks leads to sufficient vascularization in rodent models.13,14 Formulation of VEGF into a drug delivery system ideally offers control
of the amount of VEGF released and the time span of VEGF release into
the adjacent tissue.15,16 Drug delivery systems such as
hydrogels, viscous liquids, and microspheres have been developed for
sustained release of VEGF.17−19 Particularly, polymer-based microspheres
present an attractive delivery platform for proteins due to their
tailorable polymer-dependent release profile and enhanced stability
of the encapsulated cargo.20−22 Several groups have formulated
VEGF in microspheres based on PLGA, which is the most widely applied
polymer used for the design for controlled release formulations.23−27 Release of VEGF from PLGA matrices, however, is often biphasic with
a high initial burst within the first few hours followed by a relatively
slow continuous release in the following weeks.28−30 This release
profile is not ideal for functional vascularization of biomaterials
as a more sustained elevation of VEGF is needed for the stimulation
of blood vessel growth.14,31 Commonly, burst release
from PLGA-based microspheres is not controlled by erosion of the polymer
particles, but by surface-bound cargo and protein molecules that are
released from pores present in the particles that allow rapid diffusion
and release of biopharmaceutical drugs.32,33 Another limitation
of PLGA-based systems is the retention of acidic degradation products
within the polymeric matrix, resulting in a pH decrease in the microspheres34,35 that can have a negative impact on the stability of proteins.23,36 In order to obtain tailorable release of biopharmaceutical protein
drugs, Kazazi-Hyseni et al. prepared PLGA microspheres with differences
in porosity by varying formulation parameters such as polymer concentration
and oil/water ratios in a membrane emulsification process.37 An alternative approach for tailoring the release
of pharmaceutical proteins from polymeric microspheres is the use
of phase-separated multiblock copolymers.38,39 SynBioSys® multiblock copolymers
composed of amorphous poly(ε-caprolactone)–poly(ethylene
glycol)–poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL–PEG–PCL)
blocks and semicrystalline poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA) blocks
(as shown in Figure 1) are more hydrophilic than for example PLGA, due to the presence
of PEG. The well-controlled swelling of these [PCL–PEG–PCL]-b-[PLLA] polymers allows continuous release of encapsulated
molecules through diffusion with low burst release.40−42 The swelling
degree of these [PCL–PEG–PCL]-b-[PLLA]
polymers is dependent on the weight fraction and molecular weight
of PEG.42,43 We hypothesized that the release characteristics
of VEGF from multiblock copolymeric microspheres can be tailored by
blending multiblock copolymers with different swelling degrees.

Figure 1 General chemical
composition of multiblock copolymers used in this
study. In blue shading: amorphous, hydrophilic block, n: PCL, x: PEG.
In green shading: urethane linker, in red shading: semicrystalline
block, m: poly(l-lactic acid). The two polymers used in this
study differ in their block weight fraction (hydrophilic block–semicrystalline
block), PEG chain length, and total PEG weight fraction.

In the present study, VEGF was formulated in multiblock
copolymer
microspheres using a double emulsion-based membrane emulsification
method. With this method, monodisperse microspheres with a narrow,
well-defined size distribution, are obtained, which is a determining
parameter for well-defined and reproducible controlled release systems.44,45 Furthermore, membrane emulsification is advantageous due to its
low batch-to-batch variability, decreased mechanical stress on the
loaded protein, and high encapsulation efficiency.21,46,47 To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first occasion in which monodisperse VEGF-loaded microparticles are
prepared by membrane emulsification, in which we furthermore aim at
a sustained release profile of several weeks. The release of VEGF
from microspheres was measured by two analytical methods, namely size
exclusion ultra-performance liquid chromatography (SE-UPLC) and enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Finally, the bioactivity of VEGF released
during the entire release period was assessed by a human umbilical
vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) proliferation assay.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Selection of Suitable Blend
Composition
Microsphere batches were prepared with a target
VEGF loading of
0.2 wt % and different blend ratios of multiblock copolymers A and
B in order to obtain a microsphere formulation with the desired release
profile, that is, a minimal burst followed by a sustained release
for 4 weeks. These polymers were selected based on the previous work
of Teekamp et al. who achieved a 2 week controlled release profile
of human serum albumin (HSA) from microspheres based on multiblock
copolymers A and B.48 The inner water phase
of the emulsified droplets consisted of 5 mM succinate buffer pH 5,
which is similar to the buffer used by Cleland et al. for the preparation
of solid VEGF microparticles by spray-drying, which were subsequently
encapsulated into PLGA microparticles by solid-in-oil emulsification.19 Microspheres were prepared by the double emulsion
method in which a water-in-oil (w1/o) primary emulsion
was processed over a stainless steel membrane with 20 μm pores.
The obtained microspheres were collected after extraction and evaporation
of the organic solvent, washed and without further sieving or fractionating
freeze-dried. The freeze-dried microspheres consisted of uniformly
sized microparticles with average diameters ranging between 42 and
51 μm and narrow size distribution [12–28% coefficient
of variance (CV), Table S2], characteristic
for membrane emulsification.46 The diameter
of the obtained particles is approximately twice that of the pores
in the membrane, a common observation with membrane emulsification.
At high dispersed phase flow rates, the extra dispersed phase is pressed
into the formed droplet with an initial size equal to the pore diameter
before it detaches, resulting in a larger droplet diameter.46

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis
(Figure S2) showed differences in the morphology
of the microspheres depending on the polymer blend composition. Microspheres
prepared with polymer A or a blend of polymer A and B were porous,
whereas microspheres prepared with polymer B only had a smooth surface
with scattered visible pores.

Microspheres were screened based
on their 3 week release pattern,
as the growth factor release pattern in this time period is crucial
for vascularization of biomaterial implants.13 VEGF release was measured by SE-UPLC and is plotted as normalized
cumulative VEGF. Total cumulative release after 21 days is assumed
to represent the complete release of encapsulated VEGF (with the exception
of 0:100 blend ratio)fig2.

Figure 2 Cumulative release of VEGF from microspheres based on various blends
of multiblock polymer A and B (shown in legend) and target VEGF loading
of 0.2 wt %. The release was performed at 37 °C in PBS pH 7.4
supplemented with 0.025% Tween 20 and 0.02% NaN3. Released
VEGF was quantified by SE-UPLC.

Microspheres based on a 90:10 blend of polymer A and B and
of 100%
polymer A showed a high initial VEGF release during the first 2 days
followed by a period of 19 days without any further release. As we
aimed for a formulation demonstrating the continuous release for several
weeks, these formulations were not suitable for our purposes. In contrast,
only microspheres based on polymer B did not release VEGF during the
three-week timespan of the release experiment. Possibly, these microspheres
had a low VEGF loading efficiency and therefore no VEGF release was
observed. This observation is in line with the release study published
by Teekamp et al. who also observed no release of HSA in the 2 weeks
from when the microspheres were prepared with polymer B.48 This microsphere formulation also did not meet
our release profile target. Lastly, the release profiles of VEGF from
microspheres based on various blends of polymer A and B (i.e., 80:20,
70:30, 60:40, and 50:50) showed continuous release for around 2 weeks
with minimal burst release. However, the differences between release
profiles from microspheres based on 80:20, 70:30, and 60:40 blends
were minimal. The average release rate of these blends was approximately
5–7% release per day for a continuous period of at least 14
days, which met our initial selection criteria for release kinetics.
Slight differences in sustained release pattern are likely an interplay
between the total PEG content and PEG chain lengths of each polymer.
Previous studies with similar multiblock copolymers have shown that
the release of proteins from these polymers is governed by the PEG
content which leads to swelling of the microspheres, and subsequent
diffusion of protein through water-filled pores.41−43

For further
development, the 50:50 blend of polymer A and B was
selected due to its preferred release kinetics, that is, continuous
release without significant burst release, which was also the blend
that had been selected by Teekamp et al. for delivery of pPB-HSA.48

2.2 In Vitro Degradation Study
of Microspheres
Prepared with the 50:50 Blend Ratio
The degradation properties
of microspheres based on a 50:50 blend of polymer A and B was studied
with nonloaded placebo microspheres. These microspheres had a porous
morphology (Figure 3a, left image “0 d”) and a narrow size distribution
(40 ± 6 μm) comparable to VEGF-loaded microspheres prepared
with the same polymer blend (Table S2 and Figure S2). During incubation in IVR buffer for
28 days, the microspheres retained their spherical shape and porous
morphology, as shown in Figure 3a, indicating that hardly any erosion took place.

Figure 3 In vitro degradation

pH 7.4, supplemented with 0.025% Tween 20, and 0.02% NaN3. (A) SEM images before and after incubation. Scale bars represents
30 μm. The time of incubation (d: days) is stated above each
image, whereby “0 d” shows freshly prepared microspheres
before incubation. (B) Remaining microsphere dry mass after 28 days
and (C) remaining PEG content in the microsphere samples, as determined
by 1H NMR.

This observation is in line with the degradation data as
shown
in Figure 3b, which
shows that after a slight decrease in mass of ∼20% after 7
days, the remaining dry mass did not change the next 21 days. The
composition of degrading microspheres over time was analyzed for the
PEG content. Figure 3c shows that the PEG content decreased by 30% within 7 days, and
then no further changes occurred up to 28 days. Gel permeation chromatography
(GPC) analysis of degradation samples showed that the molecular weight
of the polymers was reduced significantly after 7 days of incubation
(Figure S3). From 7 to 28 days, a further
slow reduction in molecular weights of the polymers was observed.
These results indicate that in the first 7 days, a small fraction
of PEG was cleaved resulting in chain scissions in the polymers and
diffusion of PEG out of the polymer matrix. This observation is in
agreement with previous studies reporting that PEG is shed specifically
during the early stages of degradation because of preferential cleavage
of the ester bonds that connect PEG and PCL units.49−52 Analysis by 1H NMR
before and after addition of shift reagent trichloroacetylisocyanate
(TAIC) showed that the constitution of the polymers remained similar
during degradation of up to 28 days (Figures S4 and S5). The almost constant weight of the degrading samples
and their stable composition between 7 and 28 days demonstrate that
hydrolysis of ester bonds in the PCL and PLLA blocks hardly occurred.
All in all, our results show that the slight initial loss in mass
after 7 days of incubation is likely due to the hydrolysis of PEG–PCL
bonds, resulting in the loss of a small fraction of PEG and causing
a decrease in the molecular weight of the degrading polymers. Afterwards,
molar composition of the polymers remained unchanged until the end
of the degradation study. Therefore, no extensive degradation occurred
during the 28 days of incubation.

2.3 Optimized
Microsphere Formulation Based on
the 50:50 Polymer Blend
For further studies, three microsphere
batches with a higher target loading (1.0 wt %) were prepared with
a 50:50 blend of polymer A and B. The preparation method was slightly
modified by increasing batch size and VEGF/polymer ratio (Table 3, Experimental Section). These modifications aimed at increasing
VEGF loading content and loading efficiency (as discussed in Section 2.1). The loading
content of VEGF of microspheres prepared with a 0.2 wt % target loading
could not be accurately analyzed, as VEGF concentrations in the samples
were below the detection limit of the developed assay. Possible modifications
such as increasing the amount of microspheres used for the protocol
were not feasible, as it would have required dissolving ∼380
mg microspheres in 0.5 mL dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in order to fall
within the calibration curve of the assay (assuming a loading efficiency
of 20%).

Microspheres prepared with a 1.0 wt % target loading
had a narrow size distribution (Table 1, average sizes between 44 and 52 μm, CV between
15 and 30%, size distribution plots shown in Figure S6). SEM analysis of the obtained microspheres showed a smooth
surface with small pores (Figure 4). Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the obtained microspheres, per
microsphere batch and average values for the three individually prepared
batches. The batch yields ranged from 65 to 74%. VEGF loading was
determined by BCA protein assay after destruction of the particles
and corresponded to a high average loading efficiency of 78 ±
16%. The increased encapsulation efficiency as compared to microspheres
with a target loading of 0.2 wt % (as described in Section 2.1) can be explained by the
introduced modifications, in line with previous experiments.53−56 An increased polymer concentration of the oil phase leads to a shorter
time of solidification as less solvent has to be removed. This in
turn decreases the diffusion of the protein into the continuous phase
and thereby increases the loading efficiency.53 All in all, three microsphere batches were prepared with similar
characteristics regarding yield, VEGF loading and loading efficiency,
thereby demonstrating low batch-to-batch variation and good batch
reproducibility.

prepared
batches) prepared with a 50:50 blend of polymer A and B and a target

2.3.1 In Vitro VEGF Release
VEGF release
from the obtained microspheres was measured by SE-UPLC and ELISA,
as shown in Figure 5. Both cumulative release profiles were normalized based on the cumulative
release at the end of the release study (day 30 for ELISA data and
day 25 for SE-UPLC data). Microspheres of the 50:50 polymer blend
released VEGF continuously over a period of ∼4 weeks with a
low burst release. Normalized release profiles for both methods are
in good agreement (Figure 5, blue and red circles). These release
curves were fitted using the Korsmeyer–Peppas model (Figure 5, blue and red dotted
lines).57,58 The calculated parameters, that is, diffusional
exponent, 95% confidence interval, and correlation coefficient, of
this fit are shown in Table 2. Both ELISA and SE-UPLC release data show a good fit for
this model [R2: 0.97 (SE-UPLC data) and
0.96 (ELISA data)]. The diffusional exponents n were
0.41 ± 0.02 for SE-UPLC release data and 0.42 ± 0.02 for
ELISA release data, suggesting the diffusion-related release. Taking
the release profiles and the results of the degradation study (Section 2.2) together,
it can be concluded that VEGF release from microspheres occurs via
diffusion of VEGF through a water-filled porous network, caused by
the hydrophilicity of PEG within the multiblock copolymer, as no extensive
polymer erosion occurs.

Figure 5 Cumulative release of VEGF from microspheres
based on a 50:50 blend
and a target VEGF loading of 1.0 wt %. The release was performed at
37 °C in PBS pH 7.4 supplemented with 0.025% Tween 20 and 0.02%
NaN3. Released VEGF was measured by ELISA (red) and SE-UPLC
(blue), and plotted as cumulative release (filled blue and red circles,
connected by a black line) and as a normalized cumulative release
(blue and red circles). Normalized cumulative release data were fitted
using the Korsmeyer–Peppas model (blue and red dotted lines).
Parameters of this fit are listed in Table 2.

Based on loading determination with the BCA assay,
VEGF was released
up to 60% based on SE-UPLC data (Figure 5). In contrast, cumulative VEGF release by
ELISA was ∼40% (Figure 5), most likely due to the numerous dilution steps towards
the working range of the ELISA kit (31.3–2000 pg/mL) which
might have resulted in protein loss due to the aspecific adsorption
onto materials the protein is exposed to during sample handling. Similar
underestimation of the VEGF levels were observed with freshly prepared
VEGF solutions in IVR buffer and with IVR samples spiked with a defined
VEGF concentration (Tables S3 and S4).
In previous publications on VEGF-loaded PLGA-based microspheres, VEGF
release quantified by ELISA reached cumulative release of >50%
after
4 weeks.28,29,59 Because the
formulations of the mentioned studies were prepared at much lower
VEGF target loading (up to 100-fold lower as compared to our target
loading of 1.0 wt %), those studies did not require extensive dilution
for ELISA purposes. Nevertheless, the observed release profiles of
our microspheres determined either by SE-UPLC or ELISA correlate well,
corroborating the integrity of the released VEGF. To the best of our
knowledge, our study is unique in comparing two analytical methods
to measure protein release from microspheres.

The VEGF release
profile of microspheres based on a 50:50 blend
of polymer A and B (Figure 5) differs substantially from the published release curves
of VEGF from PLGA microparticles. Several groups have reported biphasic
release profiles with a high burst release (around 60% of the loading),
followed by the sustained release of VEGF for 4 weeks accumulating
70–75% of the loaded amount.28,29 Similarly,
the sustained release of VEGF from PLGA microspheres of ∼60%
up to 7 days has been reported, followed by slow VEGF release reaching
70% after 28 days.59 In contrast to this,
the VEGF-loaded microspheres used in this study, which are based on
the swellable multiblock copolymers A and B in a ratio of 50:50, showed
a low burst release and sustained release for nearly 4 weeks reaching
60% (as measured by SE-UPLC). The difference between release profiles
of PLGA-based and [PCL–PEG–PCL]-b-[PLLA]-based
microspheres can be explained by the surface-bound protein and protein
close to the surface of PLGA-based microspheres that is released nearly
completely within the first day “burst”, before the
onset of erosion. In contrast, microspheres based on [PCL–PEG–PCL[-b-[PLLA] polymers release their encapsulated cargo via diffusion
through a water-filled polymer matrix, caused by the hydrophilic PEG
blocks.

2.4 Storage Stability at −20
°C
An important aspect of developing microspheres is
preventing protein
degradation and aggregation during preparation, storage, and release.23,24,60 It is essential that the release
pattern of VEGF from freshly prepared microspheres and after long-term
storage remains unchanged. Although previous studies have shown that
the addition of cryoprotectants, such as trehalose, increases the
stability of proteins formulated in PLGA nanoparticles after freeze-drying,
the repeated storage, and long-term storage at −20 °C
has not been investigated.61,62 In contrast, the freeze-thaw
stability and long-term storage of aqueous protein formulations is
well studied, showing that the frozen storage of aqueous protein formulations
can cause degradation and aggregation of proteins.63,64 We therefore investigated the storage stability at −20 °C
of VEGF-loaded microspheres by comparing the VEGF release profiles
from freshly prepared microspheres with the VEGF release profiles
from microspheres exposed to repeated freezing and storage at −20
°C as well as long-term storage at −20 °C.

Freeze-dried VEGF-loaded microspheres prepared with the 50:50 blend
of polymer A and B, as characterized in Figures 4 and 5 and Tables 1 and 2, were frozen and stored at −20 °C overnight and
subsequently incubated at room temperature for 3 h multiple times.
After incubation at room temperature, a microsphere sample was removed
for analyzing VEGF release with SE-UPLC. The remaining microspheres
were returned to −20 °C storage. As shown in Figure S8a, release profiles of VEGF from microspheres
repeatedly frozen (up to 5 times) remained highly similar to the release
profile of freshly prepared microspheres, which was confirmed by similarity
index f2 values of >70 (Table S5).65

Microspheres were also stored at −20 °C for 1, 2, 3,
6, and 9 months. At these time periods, microspheres were incubated
at room temperature for at least 3 h, dispersed in IVR buffer and
incubated at 37 °C. Released VEGF was quantified by SE-UPLC.
VEGF release profiles from freshly prepared microspheres and from
microspheres stored at −20 °C up to 9 months are shown
in Figure S8b. No distinct differences
between release profiles can be seen, confirmed by a similarity factor f2 of >50 (Table S6).65 Neither repeated storage at −20
°C nor long-term −20 °C storage of microspheres altered
the release profile of VEGF from microspheres, as compared to release
profiles from freshly prepared microspheres. Therefore, microspheres
based on a 50:50 blend ratio of polymer A and B and loaded with VEGF
present excellent storage stability.

2.5 Bioactivity
of Released VEGF
It is
crucial that the released VEGF from the microspheres over the 4 week
period retained its bioactivity as this is necessary for stable blood
vessel formation.31Figure 6 shows the bioactivity of released VEGF as
compared to the native nonformulated VEGF, expressed as relative cell
proliferation. The released protein at different time points led to
relative cell proliferation of around 3. All released VEGF samples
fall within the responsive range of the assay (1–3.5 relative
cell proliferation). Supernatants of placebo microspheres served as
controls. These control samples, containing possible degradation products
of placebo microspheres such as PEG (as discussed above with Figure 3), did not induce
proliferation.

Figure 6 Bioactivity of released VEGF expressed as relative cell
proliferation.
On the left side of the graph (dark red bars): responsive range of
VEGF standards between 0 and 100 ng/mL (n = 3 per
concentration). On the right side of the graph (red and gray bars):
relative cell proliferation of endothelial cells incubated with IVR
supernatants collected from VEGF-loaded microspheres (“VEGF
MSP”, red bars) or placebo microspheres (“placebo MSP”,
gray bars). Microspheres had been stored at −20 °C for
several months and have been exposed to several freezing cycles prior
to the bioactivity assay. Supernatants of each time point were diluted
in the culture medium and incubated in triplicate wells (bars represent
average ± SD of n = 3). *p <
0.05 VEGF MSP versus placebo MSP.

The IVR buffer used for these cell-based bioactivity experiments
was supplemented with bovine serum albumin (BSA) and antibiotics (bioactivity
IVR buffer), instead of Tween 20 and sodium azide (components of IVR
buffer for release studies in Figures 2 and 5), as these materials
inhibited cell proliferation (data not shown). As a consequence, the
VEGF concentration in the released supernatants could not be determined
by SE-UPLC, as BSA interfered with the VEGF peak of the SE-UPLC chromatogram.
The concentrations were therefore estimated with ELISA and normalized
based on the cumulative release by SE-UPLC as presented in Section 2.3.1. ELISA
release data had a good Korsmeyer–Peppas model fit (R2: 0.98) and a diffusional exponent of 0.36
± 0.05 (95% confidence interval: 0.22–0.55), comparable
to the ELISA release data in standard IVR buffer (as discussed in Section 2.3.1, Figure S9). Our results demonstrate that bioactivity
of released VEGF was fully retained within the experimental error
of the bioactivity assay. In several previous studies, the bioactivity
of released VEGF was determined by similar HUVEC viability-based assays,
however, these studies reported the bioactivity of VEGF released in
the beginning of the release period only, that is up to 1 week.59,66 In contrast, we assessed the bioactivity of VEGF that is released
throughout the entire release period, including between week 2, 3,
and 4 of release. Precisely the later period of release, that is between
2 and 4 weeks, is critical for stable blood vessel formation.14,31 The bioactivity assay has been performed with VEGF microspheres
that have been stored for several months at −20 °C and
subjected to several freezing cycles. We therefore conclude that VEGF
formulated in the microspheres remains bioactive for prolonged time.

Based on the data shown in this study, we estimate that a dose
of 1 mg VEGF microspheres will provide an average release rate of
150 ng VEGF/day for 4 weeks, which has been shown to be sufficient
for vascularization of a 0.1 mL biomaterial implant.14

3 Conclusions
In this
study, we have developed monodisperse VEGF-loaded microspheres
that exhibit sustained release kinetics for 4 weeks. This release
profile is considered optimal for successful vascularization of a
tissue-engineered construct. The developed VEGF-loaded microspheres
were prepared with blends of [PCL–PEG–PCL]-b-[PLLA] multiblock copolymers with various PEG molecular weight and
content, using a solvent extraction-based membrane emulsification
process. The microspheres had a VEGF loading of 0.79 wt % and loading
efficiency of 78%. VEGF release is governed by diffusion through the
water-swollen polymer matrix. Released VEGF remained fully bioactive
over the entire release period of 4 weeks. Therefore, microspheres
based on multiblock copolymers and loaded with VEGF are an attractive
vascularization platform for incorporation into tissue engineered
constructs.

4.2 Methods
4.2.1 Polymer Synthesis and
Characterization
Multiblock copolymers A and B (general chemical
composition shown
in Figure 1) were synthesized
and characterized based on procedures described by Stanković
et al. and Teekamp et al.40,48 Polymer A consisted
of 30 wt % of an amorphous, hydrophilic PCL–PEG3000–PCL block with a molecular weight of 4000 g/mol and 70 wt
% of a semicrystalline poly(l-lactide) (PLLA) block with
a molecular weight of 4000 g/mol. The total PEG weight fraction of
polymer A is 22.5%. Polymer B consisted of 50 wt % of PCL–PEG1000–PCL (Mw: 2000 g/mol)
and 50 wt % of the PLLA block (Mw: 4000
g/mol), resulting in a PEG weight fraction of 25%. The molecular weights
of polymer A and B are reported in the Supporting Information.

4.2.2 Preparation of Monodisperse

emulsification-based
double emulsion method. Table 3 shows the compositions of the
different water and organic phases used for the preparation of the
different formulations.

Polymers A and B at different
weight ratios (Table 4) were dissolved in dichloromethane (DCM)
to yield a 10–20 wt % solution (see Table 3). Lyophilized carrier-free VEGF was reconstituted
in 5 mM succinate buffer pH 5 (see Table 3 for concentrations), added to the polymer
solution (final VEGF target loading 0.2 or 1.0 wt % versus total mass
of polymer/ratio 1:10 volume w1-phase to volume o-phase)
and homogenized for 40 s at 21 600 rpm using an ULTRA-TURRAX
mixer (T25 Basic, IKA, Wilmington, USA). The obtained primary emulsion
was subsequently pressed through a stainless steel membrane with a
pore size of 20 μm (20 μm × 200 μm hydrophilic
ringed stainless-steel membrane, Micropore Technologies, Redcar, United
Kingdom) into a continuous phase consisting of 0.4 wt % PVA, 5 wt
% NaCl or 4 wt % PVA, 5 wt % NaCl. Next, the secondary emulsion was
stirred at 200 rpm with a magnetic stirrer for 3 h to evaporate DCM.
Subsequently, the particles were washed with 0.05% Tween 80 and water,
and were collected on a 5 μm filter before lyophilization overnight.
After freeze-drying, microspheres were stored at −20 °C.
Placebo microspheres were prepared by single emulsion, that is, pressing
a 10 wt % polymer solution in DCM (polymer A and B blend ratio 50:50)
directly through a stainless steel membrane (as described above, for
formulation parameters see Table 3).

a Blend ratio 50:50 was selected for

4.2.3 Characterization of Microspheres
Average
size and size distribution of the obtained microspheres were
measured with an optical particle sizer (Accusizer 780, Santa Barbara,
California, USA for placebo microspheres and 0.2 wt % target loading
microspheres; Coulter Counter, Beckman Coulter, Woerden, the Netherlands
for 1.0 wt % target loading microspheres). The volume–weight
mean microsphere diameter (vol–wt mean) is reported as the
particle size. The CV [%] was calculated by dividing the standard
deviation (SD) by the mean diameter, according to eq 1. Coefficient of variance [%].
1  

The morphology of the microspheres
was analyzed with SEM (Phenom, FEI Company, The Netherlands or JEOL
JCM-5000 NeoScope, JEOL Ltd., Japan). Lyophilized microspheres were
transferred onto aluminum specimen stubs using double-sided adhesive
tape (Agar Scientific Ltd., England or JEOL Ltd., Japan). Prior to
analysis, the microspheres were coated with a thin metal layer using
an ion coater under vacuum. The sample was then introduced into the
microscope, vacuum was applied and the microspheres were imaged using
an electron beam.

VEGF loading and encapsulation efficiency
was determined by dissolving
10 mg of microspheres in 0.5 mL of DMSO. The samples were heated at
80 °C until complete dissolution. Subsequently, 2.5 mL of 0.05
M NaOH containing 0.5% SDS was added to each sample, similar to Sah
and Ghassemi et al.67,68 The samples were incubated overnight
at room temperature for 16 h under gentle agitation. Subsequently,
100 μL of the sample was transferred into a glass tube and analyzed
for protein content by the BCA protein assay (Fisher Scientific, The
Netherlands). The amount of VEGF per sample was calculated using a
calibration curve of VEGF. Known amounts of VEGF in solution were
transferred into glass tubes and evaporated to dryness. These tubes
were further treated as samples, as described above. Addition of the
polymer to the calibration standards did not affect the accuracy of
the method (data not shown). VEGF loading is expressed as mg VEGF
encapsulated per mg of the solid material in weight percentage (wt
%) (eq 2). Loading efficiency
was calculated by dividing the actual loading of VEGF by the initial
weight % of VEGF versus the total dry weight of added materials %
[%] (eq 3). Loading [%].

4.2.4 In Vitro Polymer Degradation
The
degradation of placebo microspheres of a 50:50 blend of polymer A
and B was studied by suspending 10 mg of accurately weighed freeze-dried
microspheres in 1 mL of in vitro release (IVR) buffer (Dulbecco’s
PBS pH 7.4 (0.2 μm filtered), 0.025% Tween 20, 0.02% NaN3) in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes. The samples were incubated at
37 °C for 7, 14, 21, or 28 days under gentle agitation. At these
time points, the samples were centrifuged at 2000g for 5 min. After removal of the supernatant, the microspheres were
washed three times with 900 μL reverse osmosis water and subsequently
freeze-dried overnight. The weight of freeze-dried microspheres was
noted, and the remaining dry mass per time point was calculated with eq 4, essentially as described
previously.42,43,69 Calculation
of remaining dry mass, where mdry,0 and mdry,t are the weights of dry
samples at day 0 and dry sample at day t.

The remaining PEG content of degraded
samples was determined by 1H NMR analysis, as described
by Sandker et al. and Ramazani et al.43,691H NMR samples were prepared by dissolving approximately 5 mg of degraded
microspheres in 0.6 mL of deuterated chloroform (CDCl3).
The spectrum was recorded from 0 to 8 ppm with an Agilent 400 MHz
NMR spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, USA) at 298 K. The weight
percentage of PEG in degraded polymers was calculated from the methine
group of l-lactide at δ 5.4–5.1 and the methylene
groups of PEG δ 3.6–3.7. The molar composition of degradation
study samples was further studied by adding the shift reagent TAIC
to the samples, as described previously by Petit et al. and by De
Vos and Goethals.70,71 After the reaction of free hydroxyl-end
groups of PEG with TAIC, the methylene group next to the urethane-containing
end group shifts around 1 ppm higher, that is ∼δ 4.5,
than that of integrated PEG.

GPC was used to analyze the molecular
weights of degraded polymers.
GPC was carried out on a Waters Alliance system, with a Waters 2695
separating module and a Waters 2414 refractive index detector. Two
PL-gel 5 μm mixed-D columns fitted with a guard column (Polymer
Labs, Mw range 0.2–400 kg/mol)
were used. The mobile phase consisted of DMF supplemented with 10
mM LiCl and calibration was done with PEG standards.

4.2.5 In Vitro Release Studies
Release
studies with VEGF-loaded microspheres were performed at 37 °C.
In vitro release buffer (“IVR buffer”) consisted of
Dulbecco’s PBS pH 7.4 (0.2 μm filtered), 0.025% Tween
20, and 0.02% NaN3. Accurately weighed samples of 10 mg
of lyophilized microspheres were transferred into 1.5 mL Eppendorf
tubes and suspended in 900 μL of IVR buffer. The samples were
incubated at 37 °C under gentle agitation in a rotating shaker.
At predetermined time points, the samples were centrifuged at 2000g for 5 min and 800 μL of the supernatant was removed
and replaced by fresh IVR buffer. The samples were stored at 4 °C
until the analysis of VEGF content by SE-UPLC and ELISA as described
below.

Similarly performed release studies from microspheres
stored at −20 °C for several months (and exposed to several
freezing cycles) were conducted in sterilized release buffer (“bioactivity
IVR buffer”) that did not contain sodium azide and Tween 20.
This buffer consisted of Dulbecco’s PBS pH 7.4, 0.2 μm
filtered (as stated above), 0.5% BSA, 30 μg/mL gentamicin, and
15 ng/mL amphotericin. VEGF concentrations in the collected supernatants
were measured by ELISA (see Section 4.2.5.2). The bioactivity of released VEGF
was determined by the endothelial cell proliferation assay. Details
of these procedures are given in Section 4.2.7.

To obtain more information on
the mechanism of release, the release
data obtained from SE-UPLC and ELISA analysis were fitted using the
Korsmeyer–Peppas model, where Qt is the amount of drug released from microspheres
at time point t, Q0 is
the initial amount of drug in microspheres, n is
the diffusional exponent indicative of the transport mechanism, and Kp is the Korsmeyer–Peppas constant incorporating
structural and geometric characteristics of the dosage form (eq 5).58 The diffusional exponent n was calculated from
the fitted linear regression lines of log (% drug released) versus
log (time) (eq 6). Korsmeyer–Peppas equation.

4.2.5.1 VEGF
Analysis by SE-UPLC
The
samples were analyzed without dilution using SE-UPLC on a Waters Acquity
H-class UPLC system (Waters, Milford, USA) with a FLR-detector, operated
at λex: 276 nm, λem: 310 nm. The
system was equipped with a Waters Acquity UPLC Protein BEH SEC column
(150 mm × 4.6 mm; 1.7 μm) maintained at 25 °C. The
mobile phase consisted of a 50 mM phosphate, 0.4 M perchlorate buffer
pH 6.3/acetonitrile (90:10, v/v), and was operated at a flow rate
of 0.30 mL/min. Sample aliquots of 10 μL were automatically
injected. The VEGF retention time under these conditions was 4.5 min.
The linear range of the VEGF calibration curve was 2 μg/mL (detection
limit)–200 μg/mL VEGF.

4.2.5.2 VEGF
Analysis by ELISA
In vitro
release samples were analyzed by a sandwich ELISA (Human VEGF DuoSet
ELISA, R&D Systems, Abingdon, United Kingdom) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. The VEGF stock solution of the ELISA
kit was used for calibration in the concentration range of 31–2000
pg/mL. Release samples were diluted with the reagent diluent to fall
within the working range of the assay and measured in duplicate. ELISA
plates were read at 450 nm using a SPECTROstar Nano plate reader (BMG
Labtech, Ortenberg, Germany).

4.2.5.3 Comparison
VEGF Detection by ELISA and
SE-UPLC
VEGF detection by ELISA and SE-UPLC was compared
by quantifying fresh, nonformulated VEGF in solution with defined
concentrations. A 1 mg/mL VEGF solution in IVR buffer was prepared
by reconstituting 1 mg of freeze-dried VEGF, as received by PeproTech,
in 1 mL of IVR buffer (Dulbecco’s PBS pH 7.4 (0.2 μm
filtered), 0.025% Tween 20, 0.02% NaN3, see Section 4.2.5). This
solution was diluted further in IVR buffer to VEGF solutions of 6,
60, and 160 μg/mL. VEGF was quantified by ELISA and SE-UPLC.
Similarly, the IVR samples from microspheres (as described in Section 4.2.5) were spiked
with 50 μg/mL of fresh, nonformulated VEGF in IVR buffer. The
samples were measured by SE-UPLC and ELISA.

4.2.6 Storage Stability: Reproducibility of Release
Profiles
4.2.6.1 Stability after Repeated Freezing and
Storage at −20 °C
To study the effect of repeated
storage at −20 °C on the in vitro release profile, 90
mg of freshly prepared freeze-dried microspheres (as described in Section 4.2.2, 1.0 wt
% target VEGF loading) were accurately weighed, transferred into a
1.5 mL Eppendorf tube, and stored at −20 °C for a minimum
of 16 h. Next, the microsphere sample was taken out of the freezer
and incubated at room temperature for at least 3 h. A 10 mg microsphere
sample was removed and subjected to an in vitro release study, as
described in Sections 4.2.5 and 4.2.5.1 (release measured
by SE-UPLC). The remaining microsphere sample was placed back into
the −20 °C freezer. This procedure was repeated five times.
VEGF release profiles, obtained after repeated freezing to and storage
at −20 °C, were compared to the release profiles from
freshly prepared microspheres (t = 0).

4.2.6.2 Long-Term Storage Stability at −20
°C
The stability of VEGF-loaded microspheres was assessed
for storage durations of 1, 2, 3, 6, and 9 months at −20 °C.
In detail, 90 mg of freeze-dried VEGF-loaded microsphere samples (prepared
as described in Section 4.2.2, 1.0 wt % target VEGF loading) were accurately weighed,
transferred into a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube, and stored at −20
°C. After the indicated storage period, the samples were removed
from the freezer and were incubated at room temperature for at least
3 h. Afterwards, the microsphere samples were subjected to an in vitro
release study, as described in Sections 4.2.5 and 4.2.5.1 (release measured by SE-UPLC). The release profiles (obtained after
various storage duration at −20 °C) were compared to the
release profile of freshly prepared freeze-dried microspheres (t = 0).

4.2.6.3 Similarity Factor f2
The SE-UPLC release curves of microspheres
after
storage at −20 °C (Sections 4.2.6.1 and 4.2.6.2) were compared by calculation of the similarity factor f2. The differences of the amount of drug released from
a reference batch (R) and from a test batch (T) at time point t are further transformed
according to eq 7. Two
release curves are regarded to be similar when f2 is between 50 and 100, whereby a f2 value of 50 represents a 10% difference and 100 represents fully
equal release curves. Two release curves are regarded different if f2 < 50.57,65 Similarity factor f2.

4.2.7 Bioactivity
of VEGF
The bioactivity
of released VEGF was determined using an in-house developed Alamar
Blue proliferation assay with HUVEC.72−74 HUVECs (Lonza, Switzerland)
were cultured until passage 2–5 in the EBM-2 complete medium
(Lonza CC-3162) supplemented with a growth factor bullet kit. Actual
proliferation assays were performed in a growth-factor poor medium
(bioactivity medium). Addition of VEGF to the medium was able to enhance
proliferation approximately 3.5-fold. VEGF standards (10–100
ng/mL) were prepared in the M199 medium supplemented with 2.5% fetal
bovine serum (bioactivity medium). Release samples were collected
at different time points (1, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days) and diluted 500
times in order to fall within the (linear) proliferation range for
nonformulated VEGF (10–100 ng/mL). Prior to the experiment,
96-well plates (Greiner Bio-One, The Netherlands) were coated overnight
at 4 °C with 100 μL of coating solution consisting of 50
μg/mL collagen I, rat tail (Corning 354236, USA) in 20 mM acidic
acid. On the day of the experiment, the plates were washed twice with
PBS before seeding of the cells. Subsequently, the wells were filled
with 100 μL of the sample or VEGF standard and 4000 cells suspended
in 100 μL of the bioactivity medium (making a total of 200 μL
per well). Wells without cells and filled with 200 μL of the
bioactivity medium served as controls. The cells were incubated at
37 °C/5% CO2 for 92 h, after which 20 μL of
the Alamar Blue reagent was added to the wells. The plates were incubated
for another 4 h, before measuring the fluorescence (λex 530 nm and λem 600 nm) with a microplate reader
(Berthold Mithras LB 940, Germany). The results are expressed as relative
cell proliferation, which is the proliferation in % normalized by
the proliferation of cells that were incubated without VEGF.

4.2.8 Statistical Analysis
Data are presented
as average with SD. Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad
Prism7 using the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukeys multicomparison
test. Differences between the analyzed groups were considered significant
if p < 0.05.
