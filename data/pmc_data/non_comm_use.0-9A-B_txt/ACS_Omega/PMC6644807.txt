Metallic nanoalloys
are essential because of the synergistic effects
rather than the merely additive effects of the metal components. Nanoscience
is currently able to produce one-atom-thick linear atomic chains (LACs),
and the NiAl(110) surface is a well-tested template used to build
them. We report the first study based on ab initio density functional
theory methods of one-dimensional transition-metal (TM) nanoalloys
(i.e., LACs) grown on the NiAl(110) surface. This is a comprehensive
and detailed computational study of the effect of alloying groups
10 and 11 metals (Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, and Au) in LACs supported on the
NiAl(110) surfaces to elucidate the structural, energetic, and electronic
properties. From the TM series studied here, Pt appears to be an energy-stabilization
species; meanwhile, Ag has a contrasting behavior. The work function
changes because the alloying in LACs was satisfactorily explained
from the explicit surface dipole moment calculations using an ab initio
calculation-based approach, which captured the electron density redistribution
upon building the LAC.

Introduction
Technological evolution
led to the development of powerful and
delicate microscopic techniques, in such a way that in the early 1990s,
it became possible to image at an atomic scale using transmission
electron microscopes. Furthermore, the use of new probes such as scanning
tunneling microscopes (STMs) and atomic force microscopes allowed
atoms to be controlled and manipulated at the subnanometric scale.1,2

These microscopic techniques allowed the scientific community
to
build ultrathin one-dimensional (1D) wires. Specifically, one-atom-width
wires [or linear atomic chains (LACs)] exhibit unique mechanical3,4 and electrical transport properties,5,6 displaying
enormous potential as electronic components in nanodevices.

Certainly, a major challenge in nanotechnology is the miniaturization,
up to the atomic scale, of electronic circuits,7 and these techniques have demonstrated that the manipulation
of single atoms to build desired nanostructures is today a reality.

However, building LACs requires very delicate experimental apparatus,
and producing such devices on an industrial scale is still far from
reality. Computational models and atomistic simulations become an
essential approach to gain insights into different physical–chemical
processes occurring in materials science, which can sometimes be too
complex. The low dimensionality of LACs attracted the attention of
some research groups, and several joint experimental and computational
studies have been reported.

Thus, electron-conductance measurements
were interpreted from theoretical
calculations on freestanding8 C LACs, also
on supported Cu LACs on the Cu(111) surface,9 and single-supported10 or double-supported11 nanowires.

In another study, experimental
measurements for freestanding Au
LACs found unusually longer Au–Au bond distances;12 this fact can be generally attributed to the
presence of atomic impurities. A complementary study using ab initio
simulations showed a chemical process in which an O2 molecule
can adsorb on an Au LAC, aiding the oxidation of the CO molecule to
CO2 and leaving an oxygen impurity in the Au LAC.13 This observation opened up the use of LACs as
selective catalysts.

Searching for new and innovative materials
for catalysis is a permanent
goal in several branches of chemistry, physics, and engineering. Transition
metals (TMs), especially groups 10 and 11, are well-known catalyst
components. In the context of nanotechnology, the ability to produce
several types of alloys at the nanometric scale (nanoalloys), by mixing
noble/non-noble metals to obtain a material with innovative properties
and with a lower cost is a very interesting pursuit. Thus, nanoalloys
based on Pd/Pt,14 Pt/Ag,15 or Cu/Au16,17 have successfully been used for
catalytic purposes.

The idea of mixing metals at the nanometric
scale to produce nanoalloys
is usually associated with the improvement of desired properties synergistically,
and the interest in such systems has been increasing in the last few
years.18

The use of computational
methods to understand the physical–chemical
properties of nanoalloys appears to be an attractive approach to provide
a way to design novel nanoalloys with desired properties. However,
aspects concomitant to the 3D dimensionality such as a high number
of configurations for each composition, system size, and morphology
restrict the number of theoretical studies to a limited number of
cases.19−21 For these reasons, the low dimensionality of LACs
allows to carry out systematic studies to better understand the dominant
effects in nanoalloys.

In the context of catalysis, 1D nanoalloys
might have a potential
application as selective adsorption traps for molecules. Specifically,
alloying LACs appears to be an adequate tool to tune the adsorption
capability of the pristine LACs for specific molecules. Therefore,
the combination of low dimensionality22 and alloying23,24 can enhance, for example, single-molecule
spectroscopic properties, possibly assisting in establishing a reaction
mechanism24 or the use as molecular sensors.25

On the basis of the high predictive capability
of the density functional
theory (DFT) computer modeling of solids and nanostructures, we aim
to investigate the structural and electronic properties of low-dimensionality
nanoalloys, looking forward to a better rationalization of the combination
effects of alloying TMs on supported LACs. Specifically, we are interested
in supported groups 10- and 11-alloyed LACs on the NiAl(110) surface.

Regarding the substrate, the unique properties of the NiAl(110)
surface make it a notable and well-established substrate to understand
the adsorption processes.26−29 Several reported computer simulation studies focused
on atomic adsorption processes,30−32 molecular adsorption,33−35 and the impressive ability to build interesting structures on these
substrates.36−38

Precisely, our work is inspired by the studies
led by Nilius et
al. in the early 2000s.39−43 These experiments demonstrated the ability of experimentally building
Au and Pd LACs on NiAl(110) and lead us to suggest that alloying might
be a realistic approach to create novel systems with desired functionalities;42 therefore, we aim to study alloyed LACs, hoping
to provide new and exciting results to help the understanding of the
physical–chemical properties of these systems and motivate
new experiments.

In this article, we first describe the computational
model used
for the simulations and some relevant substrate features. Next, the
discussion starts with a structural investigation followed by an energetic
stability analysis. The subsequent section tackles the electronic
properties, focusing on the nature of the substrate–chain interactions,
and complementarily an analysis of the work function and the dipole
moment is also presented. Finally, the conclusion section ends presenting
the main contributions of this study.

Computational Model
The computational model to describe the NiAl(110) surface was based
on a previously reported body-centered cubic NiAl bulk calculation.35 In good agreement with experimental data,44d0 was estimated
to be 2.91 Å, and the lattice parameters for the [001] and [1̅10]
directions were set as d0 and √2d0, respectively. The NiAl(110) slab was built
from a (3 × 5 × 4) supercell with an ∼26 Å vacuum
distance to guarantee a negligible interaction between the slab surfaces.

As widely reported, the fourfold Ni–Ni bridge is the most
stable adsorption site,30,31,35,36 and the deposited LAC atoms locate
on them. It is also important to note that, as previously shown, because
of the distance between the adsorption sites, the only direction possible
to form the LACs is [001]; consequently, this is the case studied
here.38,45

The alloying effect was studied starting
from the pristine LAC
model45 with the subsequent substitution
of one chain atom by a dopant, another group 10 or 11 atom. Because
of the slab size and the periodic boundary conditions, five positions
are available on the surface to build the LAC. Thus, in this model,
the atomic chain is formed by four main types of atoms and one dopant
(i.e., 20% alloying composition). Figure 1 depicts the nanoalloy model used.

Figure 1 Ni and Al atoms
are shown in light gray and blue, respectively.
The golden spots represent the main LAC atoms, and the rusty red spot
represents the dopant. (a) Top view: Distances between the main atoms
in the chain (dmain–main) and the
distance between the main atom and the dopant in the chain (dmain–dop). (b) Side view: The height
of the main chain (hchain–surface) and the relative height between the main chain and the dopant (Δhmain–dop).

Results and Discussion
Chain Structure and Stability
The
effect of the dopant
on the geometric structure can be visualized in Figure 2. Tables containing the corresponding numerical
values can be found in the Supporting Information (Tables S1–S4). The distance between the adatoms in the pristine
chains is constant (2.91 Å) for all cases as expected because
all adatoms occupy equivalent Ni–Ni bridge adsorption sites, and these positions are constrained
to the supercell dimensions, achieving a highly symmetric setting.36,38,45,46 However, for the doped systems, the atoms in the chain are not equivalent
anymore, and some deformation in the chain structure is expected.

effects on the chain structure. (a) Distances between the
main atoms in the chain, dmain–main; the dashed black line indicates d0,
the distance in the pristine system. (b) Distance between the main
atom and the dopant, dmain–dop.
(c) Relative height between the main chain and the dopant, Δhmain–dop. (d) Distance between the main
atom and the dopant in the chain, hchain–surface.

These distortions are easily understood
from the atomic radii. Figure 2a,b shows the distances
between the main atoms, and the main atom and the dopant, respectively.
As Pt and Ag have the shortest and largest radii, respectively, in
the TM series considered here,47,48 the Pt–Pt distances
are shorter than in the case of the pristine LAC (Figure 2a); meanwhile, the dPt–dop distances are longer (Figure 2b), and an opposite
effect is found for Ag, in good agreement with other studies on freestanding49 and supported chains.48

A comparison between the height of the main chain and that
of the
dopant can be visualized in Figure 2c. The main-chain position is set as the reference;
therefore, the Δhmain–dop positive values indicate that the main-chain atoms are above the
dopant position. Thus, the largest atoms (Ag and Au) have negative
values, indicating that the dopants are below the main-chain height,
in contrast to the smaller atoms (Cu, Pd, and Pt), which generally
present positive values.

The system stability was obtained by eq 1, which evaluates the total
binding energy
for mixed-metal LACs (Ebdop). Equation 1 can be further decomposed into the metal–metal
interaction energy (EM–Mdop), given by eq 2, and the chain surface interaction energy
(EM–Sdop), given by eq 3. 1   2   3  where Etot is
the total energy of the computational model; Esurf is the bare NiAl slab energy; Emain, Edop, and Echain are the energies for the main-chain atom, the dopant, and the LAC
system (the chain with the dopant atom) in vacuum, respectively; and Nmain and Ndop are
the numbers of atoms in the main chain and the dopants, respectively.
For the pristine LAC, Ndop = 0 and, in eqs 1–3, the energies become Ebpris, EM–Spris, and EM–Mpris, respectively.

In the models studied, the absolute
value of Eb frequently does not provide
beneficial information,
as has been widely reported.30,35,36,50 In fact, for the mixed-metal
LAC architecture, the absolute values of the stabilization energy
are quite meaningful. Therefore, we aim to compare the stability of
the mixed-metal LACs to that of the pristine ones. It is important
to mention that because of the periodic boundary conditions, an infinite
1D chain is assumed in the particular case of pristine LACs; the results
are independent of the size of the LAC. However, for the mixed-metal
LAC, there is a 20% dopant composition; thus, if different compositions
are considered, in other words, different computational models are
used, the absolute values of Ebdop might change, but the trends
and qualitative results should still be the same.

Figure 3a–c
exhibits the Eb, EM–S, and EM–M, respectively
(the “dop” subscript indicates that the value in the
axis is the difference between the mixed-metal LAC model and the pristine
one, e.g., Eb(dop) = Ebdop – Ebpris). Thus, when the dopant coincides with the main atom (pristine LAC),
the energy difference must be null.

Figure 3 Colored lines indicate the main-chain
atoms, and the circles indicate
the dopant atom. The pristine system at 0 eV is indicated as a dashed
black line. (a) Difference in the binding energy between the mixed
and pristine LACs, for all the systems studied, Eb(dop). (b) Difference in the substrate–chain interaction, EM–S(dop). (c) Difference in the metal–metal
interaction along the chain, EM–M(dop).

Considering Figure 3a (which shows the difference in the total
stabilization energy, Eb(dop)) for group
10, all Pt main LACs (shown
in red), regardless of the chemical nature of the dopant, exhibit
positive Eb(dop) values. This means that
all dopants destabilize the pristine Pt LAC. Furthermore, when the
dopant is Pt (the cases shown by the circles labeled with Pt), Eb(dop) values are significantly negative, pointing
out that the system is more stable than the former pristine LAC. In
fact, the energy contributions regarding the chain stability (EM–M(dop), Figure 3b) and the substrate chain stability (EM–S(dop), Figure 3c) are also decreased. These results indicate
that Pt acts, in all cases, as a stabilization agent for the LAC system.
Meanwhile, Pd LACs (black line) also decrease the total stabilization
energy (Eb(dop)) and the chain–substrate
stabilization energy (EM–S(dop)) for most of the dopants but Pt. In contrast, the metal–metal
stabilization energy (EM–M(dop)) is increased.

With respect to group 11 metals, Au- and Cu-based
LACs show very
similar behaviors with respect to Eb(dop). In addition, it is observed that the presence of Ag leads to contrasting
behaviors when compared with the other metals. For mixed-metal Ag-based
LACs, the dopant acts by decreasing the stabilization energy of the
resulting LAC (magenta line in Figure 3a). On the other hand, for Ag as a dopant, higher Eb(dop) values are attained. Similar effects
are observed for EM–S(dop) and EM–M(dop) energies. Thus, Ag can be considered
as a destabilization agent for the system.

Both the chain structural
parameters and the system stabilization
effects described in this section lead us to partially conclude that
the presence of both Pt or/and Ag in the LACs provides a singular
behavior.

Electronic Properties
Simulated STM images of the mixed-metal
LACs is a very fascinating and meaningful way to start the discussion
concerning the electronic properties of the LACs. Figure 4 shows the results of the simulated
STM images. In the simulated STM images, the intensity profile contrast
between the main atom and the dopant provides an understanding of
the surface interatomic interactions along the chain; for example,
the systems with a homogeneous intensity profile along the chain have
a higher electronic compatibility between the main atoms and the dopant.
On the other hand, the more heterogeneous the intensity profile, the
lower the electronic states’ coupling between the main atoms
and the dopant.

Figure 4 Simulated STM images of the mixed-metal LACs; a theoretical
bias
voltage of −1.5 V and adjustable height. The main atoms are
the yellow dots, and the dopants along the dashed white lines are
the blue dots. (a–e) Columns indicate the main-chain atoms.

In that sense, a careful analysis
of Figure 4 indicates
that for systems based on mixing
metals from the same group (i.e., mixing Ag/Au/Cu or Pd/Pt), the pictures
display homogeneous intensity profiles along the chain. Otherwise,
the systems based on mixing atoms from different groups show heterogeneous
intensity profiles.

Another important feature is the relative
height of the atoms.
According to Figure 4, Pt seems to be far from the surface (high-intensity profile), and
Ag seems to be closer to the surface (lower-intensity profile). This
apparent contradiction, with the previous structural analysis, is
due to the intensity profile, which is highly dependent on the theoretical
bias voltage used. For the systems studied above, we can point out
that more states are excited inside the group 10 metals compared to
the group 11 metals at 1.5 V. This behavior was previously described
experimentally for the Au monomers, the Au + CO adsorbed on the NiAl
surfaces,51 and the Cu adsorbed on the
Cu(111) surface.9 However, it is possible
to better understand this observation with more detailed descriptions
of the electronic structure.

The projected density of states
(PDOS) is a powerful tool used
to elucidate how the electronic states of each species couple with
each other. Figure 5 exhibits the density-of-states plots for all the studied systems.
As a general rule, the plots represent the d states. The closest substrate
surface atoms to the supported chain are depicted in black (Ni) and
blue (Al); the main metal chain is represented by a red line and the
dopant by a green line. The pristine LAC PDOS is in the diagonal plots.

Figure 5 PDOS on
the d states for all. Surface Ni and Al are in black and
blue lines, respectively. The main LAC atom is in the red lines, and
the dopant atom is in the green lines. The pristine LAC PDOS is in
the diagonal plots.

From Figure 5, compared
with the surface Ni (bold black line), the Al atom does not provide
a major contribution in the “d” state PDOS (blue line).
All the electronic interactions with the adatoms and the surface Al
have “sp”-localized-type character (not shown here because
of its low intensity). Carling et al. also observed this behavior
for the Pt monomer adsorption on the NiAl(110) (here extended to other
TMs of groups 10 and 11); on this occasion, because of the low “d”
coupling (“sp” character), they stated that the metallic
Al–adatom bonding might have a polar and a more ionic character.30

On the other hand, the Ni d states are
very intense and show good
coupling along the metal chain, which can be understood as a covalent
metallic bond.30 A major observation relies
on the fact that, for the main LACs of the heavy metal group 11 (Ag
and Au), the Ni PDOS exhibits a single band centered at >−2
eV; meanwhile, for the main LACs of group 10, the Ni PDOS is highly
broadened (and the most intense peak is shifted to energies below
−2 eV). With an intermediate behavior, Cu causes Ni PDOS unfolding
and is split into two bands: an intense one centered at ∼−2
eV and another centered at ∼−3 eV because of the high
coupling of Ni and Cu d states. This behavior is not observed in any
of the other analogous systems.

The electronic density of the
states in group 11 has been widely
reported for analogous30,36,46,50 and different types of systems.49,52,53 For instance, regarding Ag and
Au as adsorbates, when the lateral interactions between the adsorbed
atoms are negligible (e.g., in monomer cases),35 one can observe a typical sharp and well-defined band centered
at ∼−4 eV. Such a behavior is observed when Ag or Au
acts as a dopant, indicating a very low coupling along the d states
with group 10 metals. However, for the main Ag or Au LACs, that is,
in the cases in which the lateral interactions play a major role,
the d PDOS becomes clearly broader.38,45

For
group 10 metals, Figure 5 shows that Pd and Pt have similar PDOS profiles. In fact,
a careful look shows no significant changes in the shape of the electronic
distribution, whether the metal is acting as either the main metal
or the dopant. The Ni surface atoms and both Pd and Pt belong to the
same group, showing an effective coupling.

The electron density
difference matrix Δρ(xyz) (eq 4) is a well-established
and useful tool26,27,30 to further understand trends in formation of chemical bonds.
In a similar approach to that used in eqs 1–3, 4 takes into account the difference in the electron density
of the total system (Δρtot(xyz)) with respect to the isolated surface (Δρsurf(xyz)) and the isolated chain (Δρchain(xyz)). 4  

A comparison of the
LAC electron density difference plots can be
seen in Figure 6 in
which the pallet of colors varies from blue (charge depletion) to
red (charge accumulation). More specifically, Figure 6 exhibits the cut along the
chain plane in the [001] direction. In the Supporting Information, the structures from other angle views and directions
are also shown (Figures S1–S5).

Figure 6 Electron
density difference isosurfaces (0.012 e/bohr3) along the
[001] direction (inside cut view). The accumulation or
depletion of the electronic charge is indicated using a pallet from
red (positive charge) to blue (negative charge). (a,b) Group 10 main
LACs and (c–e) group 11 main LACs.

Regarding group 11 main LACs, two distinct behaviors are
observed
depending on the group to which the dopant belongs. First, when both
the dopant and the main atom belong to group 11 (mixed LACs: Agmain–Audop, Agmain–Cudop, Aumain–Agdop, Aumain–Cudop, Cumain–Agdop, and Cumain–Audop), a very intense
electron density accumulation (yellow to red) is observed between
the surface and the chain as well as some electron density accumulation
atop the chain atoms. Second, for group 10 dopants (LACs: Agmain–Pddop, Agmain–Ptdop, Aumain–Pddop, Aumain–Ptdop, Cumain–Pddop, and Cumain–Ptdop), the electron density accumulation
between the surface and the chain is less intense (lying in the green
region), but a very intense electron density accumulation is observed,
noted by the small red area inside the dopant atom. These two observations
imply that the electron density accumulation between the surface and
the chain for the main atoms of group 11 is highly dependent on the
dopant.

On the other hand, for group 10 LACs, no significant
changes are
observed concerning the electron density difference profile in the
surface–chain interface (as seen in columns a and b in Figure 6) regardless of the
chemical nature of the dopant. Furthermore, it is possible to identify
an expressive electron density accumulation in the interatomic space
along the chain, illustrated by the intense red domains inside the
main atoms in the LAC. Here, it is worth mentioning that a deep difference
in the charge density profile is observed for all Pt main LACs, depending
on the distance between the Pt and the dopant (i.e., if the Pt is
immediately close to or if it is far from the dopant). Such an observation
leads us to conclude that the electronic structure of Pt is highly
affected by the dopant.

Another analysis of the electron densities
can be done by evaluating
the atomic Bader charges. These charges were evaluated for every atom
in all systems. First, the mean charge (in the electronic charge unit,
e) of the pristine LAC system (qpris)
was found to be: Pd (0.644), Pt (0.933), Cu (0.202), Ag (0.167), and
Au (0.502). Subsequently, for the mixed metal LACs, we chose to use
the dopant atom charge (qdop) as a probe
and further observe how the charge is affected by the electronegativity
of the main-chain atoms. The variation in the charge (Δq = qdop – qpris) of the dopant with respect to the main-chain composition
is plotted in Figure 7a–e.

Figure 7 Positive values (red) indicate the dopant charge gain;
negative
values (blue) indicate the dopant charge loss; null values are expected
for pristine LACs. (a–e) Mean Bader charge variation for the
dopants with respect to the main LAC plots. (f) Simple chart of the
electronegativity effect.

A careful look at Figure 7 shows some interesting properties concerning the electronegativity
of the metals of groups 10 and 11. For example, as dopants, Pt and
Au charges are always higher when compared with the pristine LAC;
hence, for every main atom system, the Pt and Au LACs withdraw the
electron density from the main chain. In other words, both Pt and
Au exhibit higher electronegativity for the series.

On the other
hand, Ag and Cu behave alike, in the sense that both
have an analogous charge and always have a lower charge than that
of the pristine LAC case, transferring the charge to the main LAC
atoms. For Pd, there is an intermediate behavior; it loses the charge
for the Au and Pt main atoms and gains the charge from the Ag and
Cu main atoms. As a partial conclusion, it is possible to claim that
Pt and Au are the most electronegative atoms, Ag and Cu are electropositive,
and Pd is an intermediate case.

Besides the dopant mean charge,
the individual atom charges in
the chain are very meaningful. In particular, the main atoms are not
equivalent in the chain, the dopant highly affects the density charge
of the neighboring atoms, and consequently, the Bader charges may
fluctuate along the atoms in the chain. This charge is significant
because it explicitly exhibits the charge flux between the atoms.
The Supporting Information (Tables S5–S9)
shows the charge of the individual atoms in the chain for all the
studied LAC systems. The main atoms with indexes 1 and 2 depict the
far-away atoms, and the main atom indexes 3 and 4 are the dopant neighbors
(Figure 1 shows the
model used). A careful analysis of the tables in the Supporting Information suggests the following electronegativity
trend: Pt > Au ≫ Pd ≫ Cu > Ag.

It is well
established that adsorbates may deeply affect the surface
electronic structure. In that sense, one property that is highly affected
by the presence of an adsorbate is the work function (Φ). The
work function is the amount of energy needed to drag one surface electron
toward a vacuum. The absolute values of the work function are not
commonly significant, but differences (ΔΦ) between the
work function values for the systems before and after the adsorption
processes are particularly meaningful.

In the DFT calculations,
for the surface systems, the electrostatic
potential along the z direction (V(z)) converges to a flat and well-defined value
at the vacuum region. Our computational model is not symmetric: one
surface contains the LAC atoms, whereas the other is clean. For each
surface, there is a different converged electrostatic potential value,
and the difference between them is indeed the work function change,
ΔΦ, for the system.54Figure 8a exhibits the values
of the work function changes for each system.

Figure 8 Work function and surface
dipole models. (a) Work function changes
(in eV). (b) Surface dipole (in D) using the Helmholtz model (eq 5). (c) Surface dipole obtained
from first-principle calculations (eq S3). The main-chain atoms are indicated by the colored lines, and the
dopants are indicated by the circles.

There is a traditional rule establishing a correlation between
the work function changes and the electronic reorganization upon the
adsorption process. Thus, if the adsorbate withdraws the electron
density from the substrate, there will be an increase in the work
function. In contrast, when the adsorbate donates the electron density
to the surface, a decrease in the work function is expected.

However, for several systems, this general rule sometimes fails
on predictions,55,56 and a more detailed description
is needed. It is necessary to understand how the surface electron
density distribution may affect the work function. As a matter of
fact, for the atoms of groups 10 and 11 adsorbed on the NiAl(110)
surface, the electronegativity is not sufficient to fully understand
the trends in the work function changes, as already reported in previous
publications.35,38 Similar discussions on the modified
local surface dipole of the metal surfaces by different effects such
as molecular adsorption or ionic layer covering have been reported.57

A known elegant description55,56,58−60 quantitatively
connects the dipole moment change
(Δμ) (or simply the surface dipole) with the electron
density difference (eq 4) of the system. The planar averaged electron density (Δρ(z)) is obtained by averaging in the (x,y) plane, and the dipole moment density is scaled along
the z direction (Δρ(z)·z). These two curves are plotted for pristine LACs in Figure 9, and they can provide
critical information about the electron-charge transfer in the adsorbate–substrate.
The resulting surface dipole is the integration in the z direction. More details of the method are provided in the Supporting Information.

Figure 9 (a–e) Planar averaged
charge density Δρ(z) (e Å–1) in the black line and
the dipole moment density (Δρ(z)·z) (e) in the red. Vertical dashed lines indicate the top
surface Ni and the main metal atom positions.

Three relevant ranges are highlighted in Figure 9. The first (in light gray)
is the space
between the NiAl surface and the chain (∼1.7 Å to 3.7
Å). A valley followed by a peak can be observed. Physically,
this represents the withdrawn electron density from the NiAl surface
toward the chain structure, which is the effect of the atom electronegativity.
Group 10 atoms (Pd and Pt) exhibit the most prominent depletion zones.

The medium gray area (∼3.7 Å to 4.6 Å) corresponds
to a secondary electronegativity effect. It relates to the electron
density accumulation in the LAC atoms; in these cases, the less-electronegative
atoms exhibit very modest peaks (even not observable for Cu).

The third zone (in dark gray) can be understood as the electron
density reorganization above the atomic chain and is therefore related
to the polarizability. As a matter of fact, this is an important zone
regarding the values of Δμ. According to eq S2, the further away from the slab center, the higher the
effects on n(z) will be and, consequently,
the greater the effects on the Δμ will be (eq S3). For instance, Ag and Cu (the most polarizable
atoms) display the most intense valleys; therefore, the integration
of this area (negative values) pushes the surface dipole moment to
lower values (as can be observed in Figure 9c).

For a comparison, the surface dipole
was also obtained using the
Helmholtz model61 (eq 5), where the surface dipole Δμ
is linearly connected with the surface working function change ΔΦ
and the computational model parameter A (slab surface
area) and Θ (surface coverage), scaled by the constants e (elementary charge) and ε0 (vacuum permittivity).a The values of the dipole moment differences were
obtained for all the mixed-metal LAC systems. In Figure 8b,c, the graph exhibits trends
in the values for Δμ (lines) as a function of the dopant
for both the Helmholtz model and the first-principle calculations
approach, respectively. The same trends and the linear relation with
the work function differences are observed from Figure 8a. 5  

From Figure 8a,
all the work function changes induced by the presence of the pristine
LACs are negative values (except for pristine Pt LAC), which would
not be expected from the traditional arguments considering that all
TMs are more electronegative than the support. Furthermore, the surface
dipole values shown in Figure 8c are larger than those obtained from the Helmholtz equation
(Figure 8b). A more
detailed analysis shows that these differences are about 0.2 D for
the metals with low-electronegativity and high-polarizability atoms
(Ag and Cu) and about 0.1 D for high-electronegativity and low-polarizability
atoms (Au and Pt).

Deviances from purely electrostatic models
(i.e., the Helmholtz
equation) would be more significant when dealing with more polarizable
systems, as was observed in Figure 9. Thus, the alloying of pristine LACs constitutes a
way to model systems with controlled local dipoles and consequently,
with the desired work function changes.

Conclusions
In
this study, we have explored the electronic and structural properties
of TM chains (one-atom-thick), namely, LACs, and the effects when
alloying with other metals of groups 10 and 11. Although the first
LACs were built using STM techniques in the earlier 2000s, there has
not been much progress since then. Here, we report the first comparative
study using DFT calculations, intending to rationalize the physical–chemical
properties of these systems to model nanodevices with specific functionalities
to be used in different technological areas, such as molecular adsorption,
catalysis, and transport properties.

Metal dopants modify the
electron density distribution of the pristine
LACs, creating regions with charge depletion (using Cu and Ag dopants)
or charge accumulation (using Pt and Au dopants), and this effect
might be used to trap small molecules selectively conducting to specific
pathways in chemical reactions or also enhancing spectroscopic properties.
It was possible to establish the following electronegativity series:
(Pt > Au > Pd > Cu > Ag).

Therefore, using computational
modeling, which has now reached
a high degree of predictive potential, we presented these new systems,
namely, alloy LACs, which nowadays can be experimentally built, and
showed interesting results that can be helpful in the area of nanoscience.

Methodology
All results presented in this work were based on the DFT calculations
using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package. The plane waves basis
set62,63 was set up with the kinetic energy cutoff
set to 300 eV (to obtain converged energies below 1 meV/atom). Plane
waves were used to describe the valence electrons, and the inner electrons
were treated using the projector-augmented wave method.64,65

The Brillouin zone was sampled with a 2 × 3 × 1
Monkhorst–Pack
grid66 for structural optimization, and
with a 4 × 6 × 1 grid for single-point electronic optimization,
using the Methfessel–Paxton67 method
with a smearing width of 0.1 eV. The conjugated-gradient68 algorithm was used for structural ionic optimization
with the Hellmann–Feynman forces converged to a less than 0.005
eV/Å atom. The generalized gradient approximation with the Perdew–Wang69 (PW91) functional was used for the exchange/correlation
energy contribution. All the calculations were spin-polarized.

The HIVE-STM software70 uses the Tersoff–Hamann71 methodology to simulate STM images and further
qualitatively discuss the electronic states’ coupling at the
surface. The atomic Bader charges were evaluated using Henkelman’s
group algorithms.72−74 The Bader analysis is a well-established tool to
provide a quantitative description of the atomic charges and further
evaluate the quantitative description of the electronegativity of
the atoms.

The surface area of this model is quite large to
attenuate the
periodic boundary conditions bias (and have a more realistic support).
All the results were obtained for the substrate by an asymmetric slab
approach (i.e., the adsorbed atoms were deposited at only one slab
side).

a A note concerning the Helmholtz equation
may be useful: the equation used by Li et al. (Phys. Rev.
B: Condens. Matter Mater. Phys. 2002,65 (7), 075407), usually omits the term e/ε0; numerically, the results make sense (in D),
but the dimensions of both terms in the equation do not agree. Here,
we chose the most complete form of the Helmholtz equation.
