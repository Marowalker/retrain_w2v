In this paper, we describe an aptamer-based
colorimetric assay
(ABCA), which integrates enzyme-loaded microparticles for signal amplification
with distance measurement for equipment-free quantitative readout.
The distance measurement readout is on the basis of target-induced
selective reduction in viscosity of reaction solution. Its utility
is well demonstrated with inexpensive, sensitive, and selective detection
of adenosine (model analyte) in buffer samples and real samples of
human serum and urine with the naked eye. This ABCA method just requires
operators to simply count the number of colored distance-relevant
marked bars on the calibrated glass microsyringes (testing containers)
to provide quantitative results. It thus holds great promise for wide
applications particularly in limited-resource settings.

1 Introduction
Aptamers
are specific oligonucleotides that are selected from pools
of random-sequence DNAs or RNAs.1,2 They are widely considered
as the ideal molecular probes for analytical and biomedical applications
due to their simplicity of synthesis, ease of labeling, high stability,
wide applicability, and excellent specificity.3−6 During the last decade, various
aptamer-based assay methods have been developed for detection of metal
ions,7−9 small molecules,10−14 DNAs,15,16 RNAs,17−19 proteins,20−23 cancer cells,24,25 viruses,26,27 and bacteria28 in wide fields, such as
medical diagnosis, environmental analysis, and food safety testing.
Measurements of signals for these assays are implemented using several
techniques, with fluorescence7−9,15,16,19,20,24,25,28,29 and electrochemistry10,11,16,21,26 being the
two most widely used types. Recent methods include chemiluminescence12,13,22 and Raman scattering.23 These measurements can offer satisfactory detection
sensitivity, but they suffer from the requirements of expensive and
complex analytical instruments that are commonly operated and maintained
by trained personnel. This would limit their uses particularly in
resource-limited environments, including remote areas, small laboratories,
family medicine services, etc.30−32

Some studies have alternatively
been dedicated to devise aptamer-based
colorimetric assay (ABCA) methods having several attractive features
that make them hold great potential for point-of-need applications.
Principal characters include low cost, easy operation to quadrate
untrained operators, and color development principle.33−36 The ABCAs generally utilize enzyme substrates33,34 or plasmonic metal nanoparticles35−38 to transform recognition chemistry
into changes in color kind and strength of reaction solutions. Although
the existing ABCAs are facile to utilize to achieve rapid, naked-eye
qualitative analytical results, most of them still require desktop
equipment (typically ultraviolet/visible spectrometers39,40) to perform quantitative detection. In fact, few of the current
ABCAs could achieve the extreme economic aim of quantifying target
levels in samples without the aid of external electronic readers.
In this regard, a universal ABCA that enables the equipment-free quantitative
analysis would be more beneficial and desirable for use in the resource-limited
environments.

In our work, we cope with this challenge by designing
a novel ABCA
with such a merit. This approach is on the basis of the selective
change in the viscosity of a soluble starch-contained reaction solution
(Figure 1). It integrates
SiO2 microparticles labeled with glucoamylase molecules
for efficient yet robust signal amplification with naked-eye measurement
of diffusion distance of a colored reporting reagent (i.e., red ink)
in the reaction solution for simple equipment-free quantitative readout.
In our initial proof-of-concept study, adenosine, a key cofactor in
numerous biochemical processes,37 is chosen
as a model analyte. The working principle and analytical procedures
of this adenosine assay are illustrated in Figure 1. In brief, superparamagnetic microparticles
(SPMs) are immobilized with biotinylated DNA strands that have anchored
adenosine’s aptamers via hybridization reaction.38 In the presence of adenosine, each aptamer captures
one target to form an aptamer–adenosine complex. The biotin
is thus exposed to capture a streptavidin-labeled SiO2 microparticle
loaded with several glucoamylase tags via the biotin–streptavidin
interaction. The glucoamylase is further used to catalyze hydrolysis
of soluble starch-producing glucose. As a result, the viscosity of
the resultant starch-contained reaction solution is dramatically reduced,
which allows the red ink to diffuse a long distance (Figure 1, top). In the absence of the
target, on the contrary, the reaction solution containing unhydrolyzed
soluble starch could maintain its original, high viscosity and in
turn limit the ink’s diffusion (Figure 1, bottom). The diffusion distance of the
red ink is positively proportional to the target concentration in
sample. The results demonstrate that our method just requires operators
to simply count the number of colored distance-relevant marked bars
on the calibrated glass microsyringes (testing containers chosen herein)
to measure the concentration of adenosine target in buffer as well
as complex human body fluids (i.e., serum and urine). To our knowledge,
this may be the first study of applying viscosity, one of the basic
properties of liquids, to design affordable, instrument-free quantitative
ABCAs.

Figure 1 Schematic expression of assaying principle of the proposed aptamer-based
colorimetric method for visual quantification of adenosine (model
analyte). SiO2 microparticles modified with glucoamylase
tags act as signal amplification probes. Diffusion distance of red
ink (reporting reagent) is inversely proportional to the viscosity
of reaction solution (containing soluble starch) that negatively depends
on the analyte level.

2 Results and Discussion
The pivotal conception
of our ABCA strategy focalizes transition
of the adenosine determination into measurement of diffusion distance
of red ink in the starch-contained reaction solution. Thus, the starch
viscosity-dependent ink’s diffusion was first investigated. Figure 2A displays the images
of three soluble starch solutions with different levels (i.e., 10,
1.3, and 0.6 mg/mL) in three test glass microsyringes. Obviously,
it is impossible to visually distinguish the concentrations or viscosities
of these colorless, transparent solutions. As expected, on the other
hand, differentiable diffusions of red ink with specific distances
were interestingly observed in the three starch solutions after introduction
of 3 μL of the colored reporting reagent into each microsyringe
(Figure 2B). The ink’s
diffusion distances are inversely associated with the starch’s
viscosities that positively rely on its levels. This phenomenon might
be explained in view of the effect of intermolecular steric hindrance.
That is, it is harder for the ink to freely diffuse in a starch solution
with higher viscosity because of the greater intermolecular steric
hindrance. Too high starch concentration (viscosity) could even totally
stop the diffusion of red ink (Figure S1, Supporting Information). In other words, the number of microsyringe’s
marked bars (Nbar) related to the colored
distance could be adopted to indirectly measure the starch viscosity
in a certain level range. It was experimentally found that the appropriate
applied volume (i.e., 3 μL) and time (i.e., 1 min) for the ink’s
diffusion benefited the formation of a visually clear red diffusion
end (Figures S2 and S3, Supporting Information).
Moreover, because each glass microsyringe had a relatively thick outer
wall, such test container enabled stable 1 min diffusions of red ink
at wide temperatures ranging from 4 to 60 °C (Figure S4, Supporting Information).

Figure 2 Photographs obtained
from three different soluble starch solutions
(40 μL each) in three 50 μL glass microsyringes before
(A) and after (B) introduction of red ink (3 μL each): (a) 10,
(b) 1.3, and (c) 0.6 mg/mL.

Enzymatic activity of the glucoamylase-coated SiO2 microparticle
probes, which plays a key part in the detection performance of the
developed assay, was then characterized. As shown in Figure 3A, although an Nbar of ∼11.5 was counted for a 2.5 mg/mL original
starch solution, a much larger Nbar of
∼17 was obtained after its hydrolysis catalyzed by free glucoamylase
molecules. The use of functionalized SiO2 microparticles
also led to the production of a similar ink’s diffusion distance
(∼16.8 in Nbar), suggesting that
the glucoamylase covalently immobilized on the particles still retained
the high catalytic activity toward starch. Furthermore, the well-known
iodine–starch complexation reaction was used to monitor the
starch’s hydrolysis.41 That is,
the mixing of the original starch solution with a 0.3 mg/mL I2 solution (in the presence of KI) resulted in a black mixture
solution because of the formation of several iodine–starch
complexes (Figure 3A, inset, left). On the other hand, after the hydrolysis of the starch
by the free glucoamylase molecules or the enzyme-tagged microparticles,
only blue solutions containing relatively lower levels of iodine–starch
complexes were formed (Figure 3A, inset, middle and right). It should be pointed out that
a viscosimeter is routinely utilized to measure a solution’s
viscosity. However, the viscosimeter commonly needs tens to even hundreds
of milliliters of solution for each measurement and is thus unsuitable
for our approach, in which only ∼40 μL of a soluble starch
solution was consumed for one assay run.

Figure 3 (A) Comparison of the
number of microsyringe’s marked bars
(Nbar) related to the diffusion distance
of red ink (3 μL each) in 40 μL of a 2.5 mg/mL soluble
starch solution, a mixture formed after 30 min incubation of 20 μL
of a 5 mg/mL soluble starch solution and 20 μL of a 5 ng/mL
glucoamylase solution containing free enzyme molecules (starch + F-enzyme),
and a mixture formed after 30 min incubation of 20 μL of a 5
mg/mL soluble starch solution and 20 μL of a suspension of glucoamylase-immobilized
SiO2 microparticles (50 ng/mL, starch + I-enzyme). (B) Nbar values gained from the analysis of a blank
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) sample (without target) and 7.5 μM
adenosine samples using (S–Y) or not using (S–N) the
biofunctionalized SiO2 amplification probes. The insets
display the photographs of the above reaction mixtures and the original
starch solution, each of which was mixed with a 0.3 mg/mL I2 solution (containing 0.2 mg/mL KI). Each error bar indicates a standard
deviation from three tests of every sample.

Next, the feasibility of the proposed ABCA with microparticle
amplification
bioprobes was studied. Assays of a blank sample (i.e., buffer without
the analyte) and a 7.5 μM adenosine sample were performed according
to the analytical procedures schematically shown in Figure 1. After the starch hydrolysis,
the Nbar associated with the ink’s
diffusion distance in the reaction mixture for each sample was counted
and the iodine–starch complexation for each corresponding reaction
mixture was also conducted using an iodine solution (0.3 mg/mL; containing
0.2 mg/mL KI), compared to a background starch solution (2.5 mg/mL). Figure 3B displays that no
significant differences are observed in either the Nbar values or the black mixture solutions of iodine–starch
complexes (Figure 3A, inset, left; Figure 3B, inset, left) obtained from PBS and original starch. The Nbar measured for 7.5 μM adenosine is ∼19,
which is far higher than the starch’s background Nbar value (∼11.5); a light blue iodine–starch
complexation mixture was formed in this case (Figure 3B, inset, right). Both the dramatically increased
red ink’s diffusion distance and decreased level of iodine–starch
complexes gained in adenosine analysis show that after analytes were
bound by specific aptamers these recognition events could be further
traced by SiO2 particles loaded with several glucoamylase
molecules that subsequently catalyzed the hydrolysis of soluble starch
efficiently. Moreover, a low Nbar of ∼13.5
and a dark blue solution of iodine–starch complexes (Figure 3B, inset, middle)
were achieved using glucoamylase–streptavidin conjugates for
assaying the same adenosine sample. These results confirm that as
every functionalized microparticle carried with it more glucoamylase
labels per adenosine recognition event the degrees of the reduced
starch viscosity and level were greater than those took place in the
absence of such amplification probes. Thus, the improved sensitivity
for adenosine detection could be expected.

After demonstrating
the principle of designed ABCA and the efficient
amplification based on the enzyme-loaded microparticles, its analytical
selectivity was tested by conducting assays of 7.5 μM adenosine
and 1 mM cytidine, uridine, and guanosine. The four types of small
molecules belong to the nucleosides family. The corresponding colorimetric
results are shown in Figure 4A. As shown in Figure 4A, when the Nbar value of up to
∼19 is observed for adenosine assay, Nbar values for cytidine, uridine, and guanosine samples are
estimated to be only about 11 (close to the value recorded from the
blank buffer shown in Figure 3B), although the concentrations of the three aspecific small
molecules were ∼133 times higher than the analyte level. The
data imply that only the target adenosine could be bound selectively
by its aptamer strand for triggering the glucoamylase-catalyzed hydrolysis
of soluble starch.

Figure 4 (A) Colorimetric results gained in analysis of various
samples:
(a) 7.5 μM adenosine and 1 mM, (b) cytidine, (c) uridine, and
(d) guanosine. (B) The working curve describing a linear relationship
between signals of Nbar changes (ΔNbar) and adenosine concentrations (Cadenosine). Its regression equation is: y = 0.9779x + 0.2878 (R2 = 0.9954). Each error bar stands for a standard deviation of three
parallel tests.

The major analytical
parameters, namely, level of soluble starch
and temperature and time for incubation of aptamer-coated SPM conjugates,
adenosine samples, and functionalized SiO2 microparticle
bioprobes have been optimized (Figures S5–S7, Supporting Information). To evaluate the detection performance
of the proposed assay, a set of buffer samples having various adenosine
concentrations were analyzed under the optimal conditions. The corresponding
signal of Nbar change (ΔNbar) is defined as ΔNbar = Nbar-s – Nbar-b, in which Nbar-s and Nbar-b are Nbar values severally measured for each adenosine
sample and the blank buffer sample. The relationship among the resultant
ΔNbar results and the adenosine
level tested is shown in Figure 4B. One can find that the ΔNbar increases as the analyte level increases, clearly displaying
adenosine-dependent ΔNbar responses.
The proposed method can linearly detect the adenosine target in concentrations
ranging from 0.4 to 7.5 μM. The limit of adenosine detection
was calculated to be ∼0.18 μM (3σ). Furthermore,
relative standard deviations (RSDs) obtained in three tests of 0.4,
0.9, 1.8, 3.7, and 7.5 μM adenosine samples were 2.1, 4.3, 5.7,
5.2, and 6.7%, respectively, implying acceptable detection reproducibility.
As additionally shown in Table 1, in comparison to several other aptamer-based adenosine assays
with fluorescent,45−48 electrochemical,11,42,49,50 or absorbance35,36 measurements,
this new technique does not need any extra electronic reader to realize
comparable or even better detection performance.

With these good preliminary results in hand, recovery
experiments
of adenosine in undiluted human serum and urine were further carried
out to assess detection reliability and practicability of the designed
ABCA system. Adenosine with given levels were mixed with the real
samples. Then, these samples were analyzed in light of analytical
processes schematically shown in Figure 1. The ratio of calculated adenosine level
to the mixed (or total) concentration in the human serum or urine
was defined as the recovery. Assay for each sample was performed six
times, with recovery results summarized in Table S1 (Supporting Information). As shown in Table S1, recovery ranges gained from the serum and urine
samples are 92.4–102 and 96.8–104.5%, respectively,
and the calculated RSDs are in the range of 2.7–8.3% (n = 6). Significantly, the data imply that the aptamer still
presented good recognition ability toward adenosine analyte even in
real samples of serum and urine. Moreover, superparamagnetic microparticle-based
segregation and washing operations in the analytical procedures could
be conducive to minimize undesirable influences of uncaptured reagents
and interferences in the above two complex matrices.32

3 Conclusions
We develop a new ABCA approach
on the basis of the analyte-mediated
selective change in the liquid viscosity, which enables the quantitative
determination of analytes of interest with the naked eye. This should
be especially useful for application in resource-limited environments
lacking access to public laboratory construction. Our ongoing studies
include the (1) development of equipment-free ABCAs with sample-in-answer-out
quantitative ability applicable for point-of-need testing uses and
(2) enhancement of analytical performance by seeking novel chemical
detection motifs for more efficient signal amplification.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Reagents and Apparatus
The DNA strands,
whose thermodynamic factors were enumerated with the aid of previously
reported bioinformatics software,44 were
prepared commercially from Takara Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Dalian,
China). The capture DNA’s sequence (5′–3′)
is biotin-CCC AGG TCA GTG GAG-(CH2)6-NH2. The sequence of the aptamer strand from 5′ to 3′
is CAC TGA CCT GGG GGA GTA TTG CGG AGG AAG GT (adenosine’s binding sequence is underlined).42,43 Streptavidin (from Streptomyces avidinii, >17 U/mg) and glutaraldehyde were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Glucoamylase (>20 U/mg), adenosine, cytidine, uridine, guanosine,
lysine, and bovine serum albumin were provided by Sangon Biotechnology
Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Amine-coated SiO2 microparticles
(∼0.2 μm in diameter) and amine-modified superparamagnetic
microparticles (SPMs, ∼0.5 μm in diameter) are the products
of Tianjin BaseLine Chrom Tech Research Centre (Tianjin, China). Soluble
starch was provided by Xilong Chemical Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China).
All other chemicals of analytical grade were used as received. Human
serum and urine samples were collected from healthy volunteers. Unless
specially stated, ultrapure water (with a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ
cm) was used to prepare stock solutions and buffer. The deionized
water instrument was gained from Chengdu Yuechun Technology Co., Ltd.
(Chengdu, China). The used buffer solution is 10 mM phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS, pH 6 or 7.4) solution containing 0.3 M NaCl. Red ink
is from Shanghai Hero Group Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China); 50 μL
glass microsyringes are the products of Gaoge Industrial Trade Co.,
Ltd. (Shanghai, China).

4.2 Preparation of Aptamer–SPM
Conjugates
In brief, aptamer and biotinylated capture DNA
strands in PBS (pH
7.4, 0.5 μM each) were mixed, heated to 90 °C, incubated
for 10 min, and finally allowed to cool slowly to room temperature
(∼2 h). Duplex DNA strands could be formed through hybridization
reactions. Meanwhile, 1 mL of a 1 mg/mL SPM suspension was incubated
with 5 mL of a glutaraldehyde solution (5%, w/v) for 3 h at room temperature.
The resultant aldehyde-modified SPMs were isolated magnetically and
washed with buffer solution (three times) and then dispersed in 1
mL of the 0.5 μM duplex DNA solution mentioned above for a 3
h incubation. Moreover, 1 mL of a 1 mM lysine solution in water was
utilized to block residuary aldehyde on SPMs, followed by magnetic
segregation and thorough washings. Such as-prepared aptamer–SPM
conjugates were redispersed in 1 mL of buffer solution (pH 7.4) that
contains 1.5% poly(ethylene glycol) and finally stored at 4 °C
in a refrigerator.

4.3 Preparation of Glucoamylase–SiO2–Streptavidin Conjugates
Briefly, 1 mL of
a 1 mg/mL SiO2 microparticle suspension was mixed and reacted
with 5 mL of a glutaraldehyde solution (5%, w/v). After 3 h, excess
glutaraldehyde was removed from the mixture by centrifuging and washing
these SiO2 particles three times with water, followed by
redispersion in 5 mL of PBS buffer (pH 7.4). Then, 1 mL of a streptavidin
solution (1 mg/mL) and 1 mL of a 10 mg/mL glucoamylase solution were
added into the suspension of aldehyde-activated particles and incubated
for 3 h at room temperature. After centrifugal separation and washing,
the resultant glucoamylase–SiO2–streptavidin
conjugates were resuspended in 6 mL of a solution of bovine serum
albumin (10 mg/mL, containing 1.5% (w/v) poly(ethylene glycol)) in
PBS buffer (pH 6) and finally stored at 4 °C in a refrigerator.

4.4 Preparation of Glucoamylase–Streptavidin
Conjugates
Streptavidin solution (1 mL, 1 mg/mL), glucoamylase
solution (1 mL, 2 mg/mL), and glutaraldehyde solution (5 mL, 2.5%
(w/v), in water) were incubated at 4 °C overnight. Excess cross-linker
molecules in the resulting mixture were then removed using a dialysis
bag that could retain a molecular weight of ∼3.5 kDa. Finally,
PBS (pH 6) was used to dilute the dialyzed solution to its initial
volume. The resultant glucoamylase–streptavidin conjugates
were stored at 4 °C until used.

4.5 Analytical
Procedures for Detection of Adenosine
in Buffer Samples
In a typical assay, 10 μL of an adenosine
sample in buffer, 10 μL of aptamer-modified SPM bioconjugates,
and 10 μL of glucoamylase–SiO2–streptavidin
bioconjugates were mixed together. Incubation was carried out for
40 min at 37 °C to allow aptamer–adenosine binding, which
exposed the biotin moieties on the capture DNAs to further bind the
streptavidin-coated SiO2 microparticles (loaded with a
large number of glucoamylase tags) onto the SPM surfaces via the biotin–streptavidin
interaction. After the uncaptured functionalized SiO2 particles
were magnetically removed, the sediments were resuspended in 40 μL
of a 2.5 mg/mL soluble starch solution in water in a 50 μL glass
microsyringe. During incubation for 60 min at 37 °C, the glucoamylase
on the SiO2 particles catalyzed the hydrolysis of soluble
starch. Then, 3 μL of red ink was introduced into the resulting
reaction solution. After 1 min, counting the number of marked bars
(Nbar) on the microsyringe related to
the ink’s diffusing distance with the naked eye permitted the
quantitative detection of adenosine. The Nbar is positively proportional to the level of adenosine target in the
sample. Moreover, selectivity tests were carried out for analysis
of PBS buffer, cytidine, guanosine, or uridine but not adenosine.
Comparison tests were also conducted according to the same steps but
using glucoamylase–streptavidin conjugates instead of the SiO2 microparticle bioprobes. The corresponding signal of Nbar change (ΔNbar) was defined as ΔNbar = Nbar-s – Nbar-b, in which Nbar-s and Nbar-b were the Nbar values measured for adenosine sample and a blank PBS
sample, respectively.

In addition, the hydrolysis of soluble
starch could be monitored using a complexation reaction between iodine
and starch by mixing the corresponding reaction solution with a 0.3
mg/mL I2 solution (containing 0.2 mg/mL KI).41

4.6 Analytical Procedures for
Assay of Adenosine
in Human Serum and Urine
To assess the practicability of
the proposed method, recovery experiments of adenosine in human serum
and urine were carried out. Different levels of adenosine were mixed
with undiluted human serum or urine. The analyte-spiked serum or urine
samples were then analyzed according to the above-described analytical
processes. The “found” level of adenosine in serum or
urine samples was estimated from their signals of Nbar and the regression equation obtained.
