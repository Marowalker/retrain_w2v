Poly(lactic acid)
(PLA) electrospun membranes immobilized with
Zeolitic imidazole framework/graphene oxide hybrid (ZIF-8@GO) are
fabricated via electrospinning. At first, ZIF-8@GO is synthesized
by the in situ growth method. The UV–visible light (UV–vis)
result demonstrates that ZIF-8@GO has a narrower band gap than ZIF-8.
The performance of the obtained composite membrane is investigated
by scanning electron microscope, Fourier transform IR spectroscopy,
tensile test, water contact angle, and methylene blue (MB) removal
test. The results demonstrate that the degradable PLA/ZIF-8@GO electrospun
membrane shows enhanced tensile strength than neat PLA. The composite
membrane also shows great MB removal ability by adsorption and photocatalytic
degradation. The MB removal efficiency could reach over 90% at very
low ZIF-8@GO concentration (0.06 mg/mL).

1 Introduction
Water
pollution is always a serious international problem which
needs much technological concern. The dyes comprising a great portion
in those industrial contaminants in wastewater effluents are highly
toxic, affecting human health. A variety of methodologies, such as
ion exchange, physical adsorption, chemical precipitation, bioremoval,
and photocatalytic degradation, have been developed to remove dyes
from water.1−5 Among these methods, photocatalytic degradation is one of the most
effective and environmentally friendly processes for the removal of
dyes.6,7

Electrospinning is a simple, versatile,
and low-cost technique.
This technique enables the production of membranes with a high surface
area to volume ratio, large porosity, and uniform fiber diameter.8,9 The electrospun membranes have been widely used in the water treatment
because of their good adsorption ability as well as the easy immobilization
of the nano photocatalysts onto them.10,11 Because the
photocatalysts are the most critical factor in the photocatalytic
degradation of dyes by the electrospun membranes, a lot of photocatalysts
have been used to prepare the electrospun membranes with photocatalytic
ability. Almeida et al. prepared the poly(vinylidene difluoride-co-trifluoroethylene) fibrous membranes decorated with TiO2/graphene oxide (GO).12 They found
that the porous structure and the high specific surface area of the
electrospun samples as well as the advantageous electrical and structural
properties of GO promote the photocatalytic performance. Metal–organic
frameworks (MOFs) have been studied for applications in photocatalysis,
adsorption of organic pollutants, and water treatment owing to their
ultrahigh porosity, surface area, and chemical functionalities.13−15 Many studies showed that the graphene (GR) and GO have positive
effects on the photocatalytic activity of the catalyst.16−18 Song et al.19 constructed plasmonic Ag/Ag2CO3–rGO photocatalysts for the photocatalytic
oxidation of pollutants. They found that graphitic structures reduced
the recombination rate of photogenerated electrons and holes. The
hybrids of nano-MOFs and GO hybrid nanocomposites combine the unique
advantage of MOFs and GR or GO.20,21 It has been found that
they showed good CO2 uptake, enhanced activity for the
photo-reduction of CO2 and hydrogen selectivity, but their
photocatalytic active property for dyes has not been reported.

Among the utilized polymers in electrospun membranes, poly(lactic
acid) (PLA) is more environmentally friendly because it is biodegradable
and its raw materials are renewable.22,23 Zeolitic imidazole
framework (ZIF-8) as a stable and easy prepared MOFs, has been used
as a photocatalyst to decompose methylene blue (MB) under UV light
irradiation. Therefore, we report an attempt for the fabrication of
PLA/ZIF-8@GO composite nanofibers via a simple electrospinning technique
based on the advantages of electrospun membrane, PLA, ZIF-8, and GO.
The adsorption capacity and photocatalytic activity for MB of the
prepared composite nanofibers were studied. The PLA/ZIF@GO membrane
exhibited perfect adsorption capacity and photocatalytic efficacy
for MB.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization
of ZIF-8@GO
The
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of ZIF-8@GO are shown
in Figure 1a. It is
obvious that a great number of ZIF-8 nanoparticles have grown on the
surface of the exfoliated GO sheets to fabricate the ZIF-8@GO nanosheets. Figure 1b displays the C
1s X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of ZIF-8@GO. The
peaks at 292.2, 287.8, 285.8, and 284.5 eV belong to C=N bond,
C=O bond, C–O/C–N bonds, and C–C bond,
respectively. The C=O and C–O bonds are the characteristic
bands of GO.24 The inset in Figure 1b demonstrates that the contents
of C, O, N, and Zn in ZIF-8@GO are 63.5, 17.5, 14.8, and 4.4%, respectively.
The XPS results further demonstrate that ZIF-8 nanoparticles have
been effectively loaded on the GO sheets. Figure 1c shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns
of ZIF-8, GO, and ZIF-8@GO. The XRD pattern of ZIF-8@GO shows the
same diffraction peaks as ZIF-8. The (001) reflection of GO is absent
because ZIF-8 has destroyed the regular stack of GO.25,26 The UV–vis spectra of ZIF-8 and ZIF @GO composite are displayed
in Figure 1d. The absorption
band at 215 nm for ZIF-8 shifts to 217 nm in the spectrum of ZIF@GO,
which could be the result of energy or charge transfer interaction
between ZIF-8 nanoparticles and GO sheets.27 This further indicates the existence of the interaction between
ZIF-8 and GO.28 The absorption intensity
of ZIF@GO is higher than that of ZIF-8. The increased intensity of
ZIF@GO in the visible light region may due to the charge transfer
from the valence band to the conduction band.27 The band gap energy of ZIF-8 and ZIF-8@GO can be determined by the
following Eq29 1  where
α, h, ν, A, and Eg represent absorbance,
the Planck constant, light frequency, proportionality constant, and
band gap energy, respectively. From the plot of (αhν)0.5 versus hν (Figure 1d inset), the band
gaps of ZIF-8 and ZIF-8@GO are estimated to be 4.87 and 4.73 eV, respectively.
ZIF-8@GO has a narrower band gap than ZIF-8.

of ZIF-8 and ZIF-8@GO, inset is the plot of (αhν)0.5 vs band gap energy (hν).

Textural characterization was
carried out by measuring the N2 adsorption isotherms at
77.5 K. Figure S1 in the Supporting Information shows the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of
ZIF-8 and ZIF-8@GO and
the pore size distribution from Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) calculation based on the adsorption branch of the corresponding
isotherm. Table S1 in the Supporting Information lists the summary of textural properties (BET surface area, total
pore volume, and average pore size). As calculated by the isothermals,
the specific surface areas (BET method) of ZIF-8 and ZIF-8@GO are
1185.2 and 587.4 m2/g, respectively. The decrease in the
specific surface area results from the nonporous nature of GO. It
can be seen in Figure S1b that ZIF-8 and
ZIF-8@GO show similar pore size distribution. Table S1 shows that the total pore volume and pore size of
ZIF-8@GO (0.38 cm3/g and 13.4 nm) are lower than that of
ZIF-8 (0.61 cm3/g and 16.6 nm).

2.2 Morphology
of PLA/ZIF-8@GO Electrospun Membranes
Figure 2 shows the
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and element composition
of the PLA/ZIF-8@GO electrospun membranes. All samples show continuous
fibers with random orientation, which is the result of bending instability
and spinning jet. The morphology of PLA/ZIF-8@GO electrospun fibers
is significantly affected by the incorporation of ZIF-8@GO nanoparticles,
which is more obvious at high content. In the case of the pure PLA,
the fibers are smooth and of nearly uniform diameter. For PGZ0.1,
no ZIF-8@GO particles can be seen on the surface of fibers, indicating
that ZIF-8@GO particles has good compatibility with the PLA matrix.
When the ZIF-8@GO content rises to 0.5 wt %, some dispersed ZIF-8@GO
particles are seen on the surface of fibers (as indicated by the red
arrow). The ZIF-8@GO particles are evenly dispersed on the surface
of fibers without significant agglomeration. This result confirms
that ZIF-8@GO nanoparticles can be immobilized uniformly on the PLA
matrix by electrospinning. Additionally, the morphology of the PLA
fiber surface can be controlled easily through adjustment of the ZIF-8@GO
content. It can be seen in Figure S2 in the Supporting Information that the fiber of PZ3.0 shows a smoother surface
than that of PGZ3.0. A tougher surface means that PGZ3.0 has more
adsorption sites than that of PZ3.0. The energy-dispersive spectrometry
(EDS) was used to analyze the surface elemental components of PLA
and its composites. As shown in Table S2, for pure PLA, the content of Zn is zero. Because Zn is the feature
element of ZIF-8@GO, the ratio of Zn in the PLA/ZIF-8@GO membrane
increases with the increasing content of ZIF-8@GO. The result of EDS
further confirms the existence of ZIF-8@GO on the surface of composite
membranes.

Figure 2 SEM images of PLA and PLA/ZIF-8@GO fibers.

2.3 Interactions between ZIF-8@GO and the PLA
Matrix
The Fourier infrared spectra (FT-IR) analysis is an
effective analytical technique to investigate the interactions between
ZIF-8@GO particles and the PLA matrix. Figure 3 shows the FT-IR spectra for PLA and its
composite electrospun membranes. In the presence of ZIF-8@GO or ZIF-8,
the peaks at 1086, 1183, and 1453 cm–1 corresponding
to C–O stretching vibration, C–C stretching vibration,
and C–H bending vibration,30,31 respectively,
remain unchanged. Therefore, the presence of the filler did not influence
the main chain structure of the PLA matrix. However, the peak of pure
PLA at 1756 cm–1 attributed to the C=O stretching
vibration shifts to a lower wavenumber with the increasing content
of nanoparticles. This confirms the presence of the interactions between
nanoparticles and the PLA matrix. The main force should be the hydrogen
bonds between the C=O in PLA and the N–H and O–H
in ZIF-8@GO.32,33

Figure 3 IR spectra of PLA/ZIF-8@GO electrospun
membranes.

2.4 Contact
Angle of PLA/ZIF-8@GO Electrospun
Membranes
As one of the vital properties of membranes, hydrophilicity
significantly controls adsorption capabilities. The contact angle
(CA) is an important parameter that quantifies wettability which is
related to roughness, chemistry, and porosity of the surface. As shown
in Figure 4, the static
CA of the PLA and PZ3.0 membrane is about 135° and 129°,
respectively. In our previous work, the CA of the PLA/ZIF-8 composite
membrane was also above 130°.34 However,
the presence of ZIF-8@GO results in a significant decrease in the
CA, indicating an increase in the hydrophilicity and wetting ability
of the composite electrospun membranes. The increased hydrophilicity
can be attributed to the large number of carboxyl and hydroxyl residues
on the surface of GO sheets.35 The enhancement
of the hydrophilicity and wetting ability of the composite membrane
is beneficial for the removal of water-soluble dyes.

PLA/ZIF-8 electrospun membranes.

2.5 Mechanical Properties of PLA/ZIF-8@GO Electrospun
Membranes
The stress–strain curves of the prepared
composite electrospun membranes with different ZIF-8@GO loadings are
shown in Figure 5.
As shown in Figure 5, the incorporation of ZIF-8@GO nanoparticles leads to a significant
increase in tensile strength. With the increasing loading of ZIF-8@GO,
the tensile strength increases first and then decreases, reaching
a maximum at the content of 1.0 wt %. A ZIF-8@GO loading of 1.0 wt
% gives rise to the increase in average tensile strength from 2.77
to 6.17 MPa. In our previous work, ZIF-8 nanoparticles has been proved
an efficiency reinforcement for the PLA matrix.34 To the contrary, Sahoo reported that the presence of GO
and nano-sized MOFs (nMOF) could decrease the mechanical strength
and Young’s modulus of the electrospun PLA composite membranes
because of irregularity in the dispersion.36 It is apparent that the incorporation of ZIF-8@GO into the PLA matrix
results in an improvement in tensile strength, indicating a strong
interfacial interaction between ZIF-8@GO and PLA.37,38 The strain at break increased from 58% for pure PLA to 87% for PGZ1.0.
However, the strain at break is dramatically decreased at 1.5 and
3.0 wt % loading, which may be attributed to the aggregation of ZIF-8@GO
at higher filler content.

electrospun membranes.

2.6 Photocatalytic Application of PLA/ZIF-8@GO
Electrospun Membranes in the Adsorption and Degradation of MB
The adsorption property of the materials toward MB molecules is one
of the important factors to affect the photocatalytic activity. In
the current study, we measured the adsorption capacity for PLA, PGZ0.1,
PGZ1.5, PGZ3.0, and PZ3.0 over MB in darkness. We also evaluated the
influence of ZIF-8@GO content of the composite membranes on the degradation
of MB under UV-light irradiation after 4 h darkness treatment. The
MB removal efficiency is summarized in Figure 6. The adsorption efficiencies of MB depend
significantly on the ZIF-8@GO content. The increased adsorption property
could be partially attributed to the noncovalent intermolecular interactions
between MB molecules and ZIF-8@GO as well as to the increased hydrophilicity.39,40 In addition, the large specific surface area and ultrahigh porosity
of ZIF-8@GO providing available adsorption sites could also be a factor.
In the case of pure PLA membrane, no clear photodegradation of MB
is observed under UV irradiation. However, for PGZs, the absorbance
of MB solution at 661 nm decreases rapidly with the increase of irradiation
time, which is more obvious at high filler content. As shown in Figure 6, after 240 min of
darkness treatment and 180 min of UV irradiation, 16.2, 53.5, 69.5,
93.2, and 42.13% of MB is removed by PLA, PGZ0.1, PGZ1.5, PGZ3.0,
and PZ3.0, respectively. As can be seen more clearly in Figure 7a, both the adsorption efficiency
and the photocatalytic activity of PGZ3.0 are higher than those of
PZ3.0, indicating the more superior performance of ZIF-8@GO than ZIF-8.
On the basis of the abovementioned analysis, there are two essential
reasons why PGZ3.0 has a higher MB removal efficiency than PZ3.0.
First, the enhanced hydrophilicity and wetting ability as discussed
above make MB more accessible to the surface of composite fibers.41 Additionally, the narrow band gap of ZIF-8@GO
as shown in Figure 1d is favorable for the utilization of the light radiation.42 The long-term stability of the composite membrane
was also examined. After 240 min of darkness treatment and 180 min
of UV irradiation, PGZ3.0 was centrifuged and put into the following
MB solution. Figure 7b shows the MB removal efficiency of PGZ3.0 in three consecutive
cycles. The MB removal efficiency of PGZ3.0 remain above 85% after
three cycles, indicating the good stability of PGZ3.0 as water treatment
materials.

MB degradation under UV-light irradiation.

Figure 7 (a) Removal efficiency of PZ3.0 and PGZ3.0; inset is the photo
of solutions before and after MB removal and (b) MB removal efficiency
of PGZ3.0 in three cycles.

The possible mechanism for MB removal by PLA/ZIF-8@GO electrospun
membranes is proposed here as shown in Scheme 1. With the high specific surface area and
increased hydrophilicity tailoring by ZIF-8@GO, the prepared electrospun
fiber can absorb MB efficiently. Electrons, excited on organic ligands
of ZIF-8, transfer from ZIF-8 to GO and react with O2 to
produce O2•–. The resulted O2•– then reacts with H+ to form H2O2 which continues to react with
electrons to form •OH during UV irradiation.43 At the meantime, the holes left behind also
produce •OH by oxidizing H2O. These active
specimens (O2•–, H2O2, •OH, etc.) lead to the MB degradation.
In this MB removal system, the PLA matrix plays the role of an adsorbent
and a carrier, while ZIF-8 produces electrons and holes which result
in a series of reactions.43,44 Additionally, the electrons
can transfer along the large GO sheets, which makes GO a suppressor
of electron–hole pair recombination, increasing the photocatalytic
efficiency.12,44 What needs to be emphasized is
that the maximum of the ratio of photocatalyst to water is 0.06 mg/mL
in our study, which is much lower than those reported in the literature
(0.5 mg/mL as reported by Chen and 0.4 mg/mL as reported by Xu).45,46 Moreover, the solution mixing method we used to immobilize the photocatalyst
into the PLA matrix is much simpler, more economical, and more suitable
for mass production than the in situ growth method. In terms of environmental
protection and practical application, the PLA/ZIF-8@GO electrospun
membrane is a good candidate for wastewater treatment.

3 Conclusions
The PLA membranes with the embedded ZIF@GO composite were prepared
using a simple electrospinning technique. The IR results demonstrated
the strong interaction between ZIF@GO and the PLA matrix. With the
increase of ZIF@GO content, the surface morphology of PLA fibers changed
greatly, and the surface became more and more hydrophilic. The incorporation
of ZIF@GO at low contents (≤1 wt %) enhanced the tensile stress
and the strain at break. The PLA/ZIF@GO membrane exhibited enhanced
adsorption capacity and photocatalytic efficacy for MB. These results
indicate that PLA/ZIF-8@GO electrospun membranes are quite promising
in dye wastewater treatment.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials
PLA (290, Haizheng, China),
graphite powder (1–44 μm, Sinopharm, China), Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (Sinopharm, China), N,N′-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.5%,
Sinopharm, China), methanol (99.5%, Sinopharm, China), CH2Cl2 (99.5%, Sinopharm, China), and 2-methylimidazole (MeIm,
98%, Aladdin, USA) were used as received in this work.

4.2 Preparation of the ZIF-8@GO Nanohybrid
GO was prepared
from natural graphite (1–44 μm) according
to an improved Hummer’s method.47,48 The ZIF-8@GO
nanohybrid was synthesized with a method similar to a previously reported
procedure as shown in Scheme 1.20 Briefly, 163 mg of oven dried
GO was dispersed in 200 mL methanol and sonicated for 5 h. The GO
suspension was then divided into two equal parts. One was added with
1487 mg Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and the
other with 1602 mg MeIm. Subsequently, the two solutions were mixed
and stirred for 1 h continuously. Finally, the white product was centrifuged
and washed 3 times with fresh methanol before they are dried at 80
°C.

4.3 Preparation of PLA/ZIF-8@GO Electrospun Membranes
The preparation procedure of the PLA/ZIF-8@GO membrane is displayed
in Scheme 2. First,
PLA was dissolved in 8 mL CH2Cl2 at room temperature.
Subsequently, different loadings of ZIF-8@GO nanoparticles were dispersed
in 2 mL DMF by an ultrasonic bath. The ZIF-8@GO dispersion was added
into the PLA solution with constant magnetic stirring. Uniform composite
solution was achieved by stirring for 4 h. The concentration of the
composite solution is 10 wt % based on the weight of the overall electrospinning
solution. Prepared composite solution was loaded in the syringe that
was connected to a metering pump. All membranes were prepared at 22
kV at the flow rate of 0.5 mL/h. The metal plate collector covered
with a copper mesh was 15 cm from the tip of the syringe. The thickness
of each PLA/ZIF-8@GO electrospun membrane (measured by a digital display
micrometer) is ∼0.05 mm. The samples containing 0, 0.1, 0.5,
1, 1.5, and 3.0 wt % ZIF-8@GO are abbreviated as PLA, PGZ0.1, PGZ0.5,
PGZ1 PGZ1.5, and PGZ3.0 in this paper. For comparison, PLA with 3
wt % ZIF-8 (PZ3.0) is also prepared in the same manner as PGZ3.0.

Scheme 2 Preparation Procedure of the PLA/ZIF-8@GO Membrane
4.4 Characterization
The morphology of
ZIF-8@GO was observed using TEM (JEM-2100, JEOL, Japan). XPS (PHI
5300, ULVAC-PHI, USA) was used to analyze the composition of ZIF-8@GO.
The XRD measurements were recorded on a diffractometer (D8 ADVANCE,
Bruker, Germany) using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm)
at 40 kV and 40 mA. N2 isotherm adsorption at 77.5 K is
recorded on an ASAP 2020 BET surface analyzer (Micromeritics, America).
Prior to the adsorption measurements, the samples were outgassed at
80 °C for 5 h. UV–vis spectra of ZIF-8 and the ZIF-8@GO
hybrid were recorded on a spectrophotometer (UV-6100s, Mapada, China)
in the range of 200–800 nm. The SEM (S-4800, Hitachi, Japan)
with EDS was used to observe the surface morphology and composition
of the PLA/ZIF-8@GO fibrous membranes. The FT-IR spectra were obtained
using a spectrometer in the range of 400 to 4000 cm–1 (FT-IR-8400S, Shimadzu, Japan). Tensile testing was carried out
on a tensile tester (CMT, Sans, China) at a rate of 10 mm/min. The
samples were cut into strips of 0.5 cm × 4 cm. The values were
averaged over five measurements. The CAs were measured by a CA tester
geniometer (SL200B, Kino, USA). The membrane samples were measured
using the sessile drop method with water.

4.5 MB Removal
Experiment
Photocatalytic
properties of PLA/ZIF-8@GO electrospun membranes were determined by
measuring degradation of MB under 100 W UV light at a wavelength of
254 nm. PLA/ZIF-8@GO electrospun membranes (100 mg) with different
ZIF-8@GO content were immersed in 50 mL MB solution (2 mg/L) with
stirring for 4 h to reach adsorption equilibrium in a dark room before
exposure to UV light. The photocatalytic degradation of MB was measured
by monitoring the changes of the dye absorbance at intervals of 30
min with the range of 200–800 nm using a UV-6100s spectrophotometer
(Mapada, China). The concentration of MB was estimated by the intensity
of the main adsorption peak at 661 nm.
