Monoterpenes represent
a class of hydrocarbons consisting of two
isoprene units. Like many other terpenes, monoterpenes emerge mainly
from vegetation, indicating their significance in both atmospheric
chemistry and pharmaceutical and food industries. The atmospheric
recycling of monoterpenes constitutes a major source of secondary
organic aerosols. Therefore, this contribution focuses on the mechanism
and kinetics of atmospheric oxidation of five dominant monoterpenes
(i.e., limonene, α-pinene, β-pinene, sabinene, and camphene)
by singlet oxygen. The reactions are initiated via the ene-type addition
of singlet oxygen (O21Δg)
to the electron-rich double bond, progressing favorably through the
concerted reaction mechanisms. The physical analyses of the frontier
molecular orbitals agree well with the thermodynamic properties of
the selected reagents, and the computed reaction rate parameters.
The reactivity of monoterpenes with O21Δg follows the order of α-pinene > sabinene > limonene
> β-pinene > camphene, i.e., α-pinene and camphene
retain
the highest and lowest reactivity toward singlet oxygen, with rate
expressions of k(T) (M–1 s–1) = 1.13 × 108 exp(−48(kJ)/RT(K)) and 6.93 × 108 exp(−139(kJ)/RT(K)), respectively. The effect of solvent on the primary
reaction pathways triggers a slight reduction in energy, ranging between
12 and 34 kJ/mol.

1 Introduction
Plants emit nearly 98%
of the total non-methane volatile organic
compounds into the atmosphere, 20% of which comprises monoterpenes.1 Monoterpenes represent a class of C10 members of terpene hydrocarbons, the biogenic (naturally occurring)
volatile organic compounds (BVOC) with high chemical reactivity and
annual global emission rate of between 128 and 450 Tg per year.2Figure 1 summarizes the photosensitised oxidation products of the
selected monoterpenes detected and characterized in literature.3−7 The chemical structure of monoterpenes features two isoprene units,
constituting the major component of essential oils in various plant
matters and can be isolated from trees for anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial
drug synthesis.8 An alternative source
of monoterpene emission includes woody household products.9

by O21Δg.3−7

Limonene and pinene are
among the most abundant monoterpenes operating
in the global tropospheric chemistry,10,11 being produced
in relatively noticeable quantities by vegetation such as aromatic
plants, flowers, and leaves. Limonene arises mainly from young plant
leaves, and its formation rate reduces rapidly based on the age and
extent of oxidation of the leaves.12 Moreover,
this monocyclic monoterpene is significantly utilized in medicinal
chemistry and disease treatment, due to its antitumor and antibacterial
activity, and dietary formulations.13,14 Over 80% of
the total monoterpene emission from a Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) comprises α- and β-pinene,15 and it has also been evidenced that about 50%
of the emitted monoterpene from forests and tree species in the United
States consists of α-pinene.16 Other
examples of bicyclic monoterpenes are camphene and sabinene, which
are minor constituents of many essential oils from plants such as
turpentine, rosemary, ginger, and valerian.

Tropospheric hydrocarbons
such as monoterpenes have relatively
high molecular weights, thus their atmospheric oxidation gives rise
to semivolatile organic compounds and secondary organic aerosol (SOA).
SOAs originate primarily from the oxidation of BVOCs including monoterpenes.
Subsequently, SOA plays a significant part in climate change and global
radiation imbalance due to their involvement in the absorption and
scattering of solar radiation. For instance, SOA are significant constituents
of atmospheric fine particulate matters (PM2.5) as well as various
haze pollution episodes.17 Monoterpenes
find further applications in aromatization of cleaning products, paintings,
air fresheners, and flavoring agents due to their pleasant fragrance.
Therefore, the risk of accumulation of atmospheric oxidation products
(i.e., SOA) could be substantial in enclosed, poorly ventilated spaces.

The maximum rate of singlet O2 formation by energy-transfer
mechanism in a polluted atmosphere is approximated to be 4 ×
10–12 mol L–1 s–1, which corroborates the significant role of such reactive oxygen
species as atmospheric oxidants.18 Reactions
of singlet oxygen with electron-rich acceptors such as olefins, dienes,
and aromatic compounds are grouped into [4 + 2]-cycloadditions, [2
+ 2]-cycloadditions, and the so-called ene reactions. Ene reaction
is based on the interaction of 1O2 with an unsaturated
compound containing an allylic hydrogen, during which the allylic
hydrogen is abstracted in association with a reorganization of the
bonding to give allylhydroperoxides.19 Oxidation
of substrates with conjugated double bonds by singlet oxygen is feasible
through [4 + 2]-cycloaddition, resulting in the synthesis of endoperoxides.
Furthermore, the [2 + 2]-cycloaddition of the singlet oxygen to one
double bond results in 1,2-dioxetane, and apparently olefins with
unreachable allylic hydrogen atoms tend to give [2 + 2]-adducts.20 However, it should be noted that all of the
reactions can compete for the same substance if the molecular structure
allows it.21

Previous research efforts
had investigated the oxidation of monoterpenes
to SOA by OH radical,22,23 ozone,24−26 hydrogen peroxide,27−29 and nitrogen oxides,30−32 reporting the yield of the corresponding carbonyl
compounds as the predominant products as a result of the oxidative
cleavage of the C=C bonds.33 However,
the role of a highly reactive singlet molecular oxygen in the photo-oxidation
of monoterpenes has not been properly addressed in the literature.
Some experimental studies elucidating the product distribution of
dye-sensitized oxidation of terpenoid biogenic hydrocarbons (i.e.,
limonene, α-, and β-pinene) in different media demonstrated
the formation of organic aerosols.3,4,34,35 The aim of this contribution
is to report modes of reactions between singlet oxygen and monoterpenes
with a prime focus on deriving kinetic parameters.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Mechanism and Kinetics
of Singlet Oxidation
of Monoterpenes
Due to the extreme electrophilic nature of
singlet oxygen, the introduction of oxygen atoms into monoterpenes
during photo-oxidation will occur at the molecular site where the
Fukui function for an electrophilic attack (f–1) displays its maximum value. This parameter indicates
the most reactive site of chemical systems for electrophilic substitution
reactions. According to Figure 2, the f–1 indices are the
largest at >C=C< sites associated with the higher photo-oxidation
reactivity of nucleophile substrates therein.

Figure 2 Local electrophilic Fukui
indices (f–1) of reactive monoterpenes.

The interaction between the nucleophile’s
HOMO and the electrophile’s
LUMO plays a vital role in elucidating the reaction dynamics, as though
the larger LUMO–HOMO energy gaps lead to the decelerated chemical
reactivity. EHOMO for selected monoterpenes
and ELUMO for singlet oxygen are shown
in Figure 3. Apparently,
α-pinene appears to be most reactive toward singlet oxygen,
whereas camphene exhibits the least reactivity among all. Based on
the electron cloud distribution in Figure 3, the valence orbital electrons highly engulf
the π-bond, justifying the Fukui indices results (Figure 2) to designate >C=C<
as the most favorable molecular site for electrophilic attacks.

Table 1 lists
the
global hardness (η), softness (S), electronegativity
(χ), chemical potential (μ), and electrophilicity index
(ω) of the species derived from the computed HOMO and LUMO energy
levels, enabling the predictions of the respective chemical characteristics
of the species. Camphene remains the hardest reagent with the highest
electronegativity and the lowest chemical potential. Apparently, the
higher electronegativity signifies the lower chemical activity, all
of which connote a higher oxidation resistance.36 Thus, the following trend of chemical reactivity of the
species is predicted herein: α-pinene > sabinene > limonene
> β-pinene > camphene. The stated reactivity sequence
accords
well with the arrangement of the energy gap between LUMO of O21Δg and HOMO of monoterpene species
in Figure 3, i.e.,
the smaller the energy gap, the higher the reactivity.

The following sections present the
mechanisms of reaction of each
of the aforementioned monoterpenes with singlet oxygen, discussing
in detail the energy potentials and kinetics features of the reactions.

2.1.1 Limonene
Figure 4 displays the optimized structure of limonene.
According to the acquired reactivity indices in Figure 2, the most vulnerable site for electrophilic
attack rests on the trisubstituted double bond (C1=C2). Therefore, the plausible reaction mechanisms for singlet
oxidation of limonene should involve the ene reaction and [2 + 2]-cycloaddition.
The latter failed to locate a genuine transition state despite our
best efforts. Thus, the overall reaction merely involves ene-type
reaction of O21Δg with limonene’s
unconjugated double bond to form allylic hydroperoxides. Yet, our
computational model failed to optimize related diradicals as potential
intermediates in the ene reactions of limonene photo-oxidation, prompting
to suggest a concerted mechanism for the ene-type addition of singlet
oxygen to the limonene structure.

Figure 4 Optimized structure of limonene computed
at the B3LYP/6-311+g(d,p)
level of theory.

As illustrated in the
proposed reaction mechanism in Figure 5, singlet oxygen clings to
the limonene’s cyclohexene ring at the C2 atom,
bearing analogous barrier enthalpies of TS2 and TS3 around 40 kJ/mol. Hydrogen abstraction from the methylene
group (in P3) appears relatively energetically more favorable
as compared to that from the methyl group (in P2). The
C1 atom represents an alternative reactive spot for the
addition of singlet oxygen enduring a relatively higher enthalpy barrier
of TS1 (50 kJ/mol). In accordance to the computed Fukui
indices in Figure 2, this enthalpic behavior is justifiable as the C2 position
is the most favorable site for an electrophilic attack.

Figure 5 Reaction mechanism
of the singlet oxidation of limonene. The enthalpies
are obtained at the 6-311+g(d,p) level of theory and are reported
in kJ/mol.

Although the electrophilic Fukui
functions demonstrate that the
likelihood of the C8=C9 site to be attacked
by electrophiles is negligible, the corresponding transition state
values (TS5 and TS6) compare well with the transition
states for the attack on the C1=C2 in-ring
double bond. As previously illustrated in Figure 1, the literature suggests that the product
distribution from the photo-oxidation of limonene consists of terpene
alcohols that are being reduced from P1, P2,
and P3 hydroperoxides, whose RO–OH bond efficiently
undergoes a cleavage. Table 2 lists the reaction rate coefficient for the bimolecular reactions
involved in the interaction of limonene with the singlet oxygen, fitted
to the Arrhenius equation of k(T) = Ae–Ea/RT at a high pressure limit for the temperature
range of 300 and 600 K.

of Limonene Interaction
with O21Δg
reaction	A (s–1 or cm3 molecule–1 s–1)	Ea (kJ/mol)	
limonene + O2 1Δg → P1	1.53 × 10–13	57	
limonene + O2 1Δg → P2	1.87 × 10–13	48

limonene + O2 1Δg → P6	2.25 × 10–13	49	
The branching ratios for
the bimolecular reaction channels are
evaluated based on the Arrhenius parameters for ki(T) given in Table 2. Figure 6 plots the ki/∑ ki, verifying channel TS3 as the dominant
reaction pathway and P3 as the major primary product according
to the reaction network. In a qualitative agreement with the experimental
results by Chalchat et al.,37 P3 constituted ∼40% of the initial product yield from the photochemical
hydroperoxidation of limonene in the presence of oxygen. In general,
photo-oxidation of the products of limonene features −OOH/–OH/–O
substitution at para position.7,37 This is consistent
with our prediction of P3 as the likely dominant initial
intermediate.

Figure 6 Plot of branching ratios of different reaction pathways
as a function
of temperature (K).

A subsequent H-transfer
step into the outer OH group in the P3 intermediate liberates
a water molecule and forms the experimentally
detected product of carvone (P4) via an accessible energy
barrier of only 30 kJ/mol.

In addition to carvone, terpene alcohols
constitute the major experimentally
detected products from the photo-oxidation of limonene. As illustrated
above, these molecules most likely arise from a radical-induced mechanism
that begins with the fission of the O–OH bonds in the P1–P6 intermediates. For instance, the four
para-substituted terpene alcohols account for 60% of the total product
yields from the photo-oxidation of limonene.37 Clearly, these compounds may originate from the scission of the
O–OH bond in the predicted dominant P3 intermediate
followed by H abstraction by the phenoxy-type O atom and structural
arrangements. Products feature ipso substitution, most likely directly
stemming from the P1 moiety or via an intramolecular transfer
of the OOH group along the reaction P3 → P1. Such a step proceeds without encountering a reaction as an intrinsic
barrier in a thermodynamically neutral reaction.

2.1.2 Pinene
Figures 7,8, and 9 depict the optimized structures of α- and β-pinene. The f–1 indices (Figure 2) reveal C2 in α-pinene
and C1 in β-pinene structures as the most preferred
sites of interaction with electrophilic species. We were unable to
locate the transition structures for the [2 + 2]-cycloaddition of
singlet oxygen to pinene, certifying that the formation of hydroperoxides
as the sole light-induced oxidation product of α- and β-pinene
stems from ene-type reaction.38,39

terpene alcohols.

terpene alcohols.

Figure 9 Optimized structures
of α-pinene (left) and β-pinene
(right) computed at B3LYP/6-311+g(d,p) level of theory.

The reaction mechanisms of the singlet oxidation of α-
and
β-pinene are displayed in Figures 10 and 11, respectively.
The figures reveal that the ene reaction proceeds with the addition
of singlet oxygen to the in-ring C2 atom of α-pinene
and the abstraction of allylic hydrogen from the methyl group via
concerted or stepwise mechanisms. The stepwise TS2 barrier
overshoots the concerted TS1 by 20 kJ/mol, leaving the
concerted mechanism as the dominating reaction pathway for the formation
of P1 hydroperoxide. The product P1 is also
attainable through a stepwise channel via a facile transformation
of the diradical (P2) to hydroperoxide (P1).40 Jefford et al.4 recorded
similar observation, identifying P1 as the utmost product
from the 1O2-initiated atmospheric oxidation
of α-pinene.

The enthalpies are obtained at the 6-311+g(d,p) level of theory and
are in kJ/mol.

Figure 11 Reaction mechanism of the singlet oxidation
of β-pinene.
The enthalpies are obtained at the 6-311+g(d,p) level of theory and
are in kJ/mol.

Moreover, as shown in Figure 11, the ene-type
addition of the singlet oxygen to C1 atom within a β-pinene
structure (the one with the
highest Fukui function value) occurs similarly in both stepwise and
concerted fashions through TS1 (57 kJ/mol) and TS4 (49 kJ/mol) steps. Apparently, the concerted mechanism (TS4) is the governing reaction channel triggering the formation of P2 hydroperoxide as the major product of the singlet oxidation
of β-pinene. The stepwise TS1 channel, on the other
hand, gives rise to the production of a diradical P1, which
further branches into two exit routes, resulting in two types of hydroperoxide
adducts, P2 and P3. The product P2 resides in a significant well-depth in reference to the entrance
channel, affirming its greater stability as compared to P3 hydroperoxide. Besides, TS2 signifies a trivial transition
barrier leading to the formation of the main product P2.

Table 3 presents
the fitted Arrhenius parameters. According to the computed reaction
rate coefficients, the α-pinene + O21Δg reaction proceeds predominantly by the ene addition
of the singlet delta oxygen to C2 atom to form P1 hydroperoxide in a concerted mechanism. Oxidation of β-pinene
by 1O2 similarly proceeds through a concerted
channel, giving rise to the formation of P2 hydroperoxide
via an enthalpy barrier of 49 kJ/mol.

Data in Table 3 afforded
the estimation of the branching ratios of the bimolecular reaction
channels for α- and β-pinene as shown in Figure 12. In view of this finding,
the concerted TS1 channel remains the dominant reaction
pathway for the singlet oxidation of α-pinene, and there exists
a moderate decline in the branching ratio value as the temperature
increases, reflecting the reverse effect of temperature on the reaction
rate constant of the concerted mechanism of the singlet oxygen addition
to α-pinene.

Figure 12 Plots of branching ratios of α-pinene (top) and
β-pinene
(bottom) at different temperatures (K).

In a similar fashion, the concerted TS4 step leads to
the reaction pathways for the singlet oxidation of β-pinene
and the calculated branching ratios show that the contribution of
the concerted mechanism (k4) noticeably
diminishes as the temperature increases. Nonetheless, at atmospheric
relevant temperatures (i.e., 300 K), reaction of β-pinene with
singlet oxygen largely ensues via the concerted mechanism.

2.1.3 Camphene and Sabinene
There exists
a resemblance between the structure of camphene (Figure 13) and β-pinene owing
to the presence of an exocyclic double bond. Therefore, the addition
of a singlet oxygen to camphene in an ene reaction mode occurs at
the C1 position via a stepwise mechanism.

Figure 13 Optimized structure
of camphene computed at the B3LYP/6-311+g(d,p)
level of theory.

According to the mechanism
of the singlet-oxygen-initiated atmospheric
oxidation of camphene shown in Figure 14, the initial reaction between camphene
and singlet oxygen comprises O21Δg addition to the terminal carbon atom of C1 via
sizable thermal enthalpy (TS1) amounting to 132 kJ/mol.
The resulting highly unstable diradical (P2) is then transformed
to the P2 hydroperoxide adduct through a readily accessible
transition state TS2 through an enthalpic barrier of 30
kJ/mol.

Figure 14 Reaction mechanism of the singlet oxidation of camphene. The enthalpies
are obtained at the 6-311+g(d,p) level of theory and are in kJ/mol.

Table 4 assembles
the fitted high-pressure limiting Arrhenius parameters. The relatively
high activation barrier of camphene photo-oxidation (Ea = 139 kJ/mol) correlates well with its high LUMO–HOMO
energy gap (Table 1) and proves its slight tendency to undergo 1O2-induced oxidation process.

P1 → P2	3.58 × 10+12	33	
Furthermore, sabinene,
as illustrated in Figure 15, represents a bicyclic monoterpene and
encompasses an exocyclic double bond. The sabinene’s terminal
double bond is characterized as an exclusive electron-rich molecular
site and could readily be attacked by reactive oxygen species such
as O21Δg.

Figure 15 Optimized structure
of sabinene computed at the B3LYP/6-311+g(d,p)
level of theory.

Introduction of singlet
oxygen to the sabinene structure via ene
reaction takes place at the C1 site through a concerted
bimolecular reaction bearing a slight thermal enthalpy barrier of
55 kJ/mol (Figure 16). The oxidation process proceeds with an activation energy of 62
kJ/mol as obtained from the first-order Arrhenius equation fitted
for the temperature range of 300–600 K (Table 5).

The resulting hydroperoxide (P1) would presumably be
reduced to the corresponding alcohol (I) and aldehyde (II) via the
O–O bond fission stimulated by thermal or catalytic effects.41

2.2 Effect of Solvent on Singlet
Oxidation of
Cyclic Monoterpenes
This section considers the influence
of solvent in the relevant process involving the interaction of singlet
oxygen with monoterpenes rather than atmospheric oxidation. The selected
monoterpenes are nearly insoluble in water42 and thus methanol served as the solvent herein. The polarizable
continuum model43 simulates the aqueous
medium. In essence, this method relies on the representation of a
solute molecule as a charge distributor located inside a cavity surrounded
by a continuous dielectric medium, which is polarized as a result
of the point charge distribution on the cavity surface.

According to Figures 17 and 18, the effect
of solvent is revealed through a systematic energy reduction in the
barrier enthalpies of the transition states, intermediates, and final
products along the major channels of the singlet oxygen interaction
with each monoterpene substrate. The reduced enthalpies (involving
solvent effect) with reference to the gas-phase system range from
12 kJ/mol (P1 value in α-pinene) to 34 kJ/mol (P7 value in limonene). Although the reaction barrier enthalpies
are influenced by solvent effects, the product distribution and reaction
channels remain intact.

3 Conclusions
Introduction of singlet oxygen
to the cyclic monoterpenes exclusively
follows the ene reaction pathway to yield the corresponding allylic
hydroperoxides. Limonene and sabinene photo-oxidation transpire through
concerted mechanisms, whereas singlet oxidation of β-pinene
and camphene proceed via stepwise mechanism, resulting in the formation
of diradical intermediates. In the case of α-pinene, the concerted
channel ensues the most energetically favorable pathway. In terms
of reactivity, α-pinene and sabinene exhibit the highest reactivity,
while camphene is kinetically evidenced to be the lowest reactive
species incurring relatively high activation energy of 139 kJ/mol.

4 Methodology
Gaussian 09 program44 deployed the unrestricted
density functional theory in acquiring optimized energies and geometries
of the reacting species due to its accuracy in computing singlet biradical
properties.45,46 For that reason, we utilize the
B3LYP functional with the extended 6-311+g(d,p)47 basis set. A simple approximate spin-projection (AP) scheme48,49 served to correct the final energies of species displaying biradical
characters. For this, the approximate spin-projected energy (EAP) has been derived from the energies of the
broken-symmetry (EBS) and pure high-spin
(EHS) states according to eq 1. 1  where fAP denotes
the spin-projection factor 2  and ⟨S2⟩HS and ⟨S2⟩BS signify the expectation values of the spin contamination
pertinent to the pure high-spin and broken-symmetry states, respectively.
We verified the transition structures via intrinsic reaction coordinate
calculations. ChemRate software50 facilitated
the calculation of the reaction rate constants, within the temperature
range of 300–600 K based on the Arrhenius equation. The electrophilic
Fukui indices, serving as indicators for molecular site’s reactivity
toward electrophilic addition reactions, are quantified by Dmol3 code51 in Material Studio package
at the B3LYP functional while applying a double numerical plus d-functions
atomic basis set.
