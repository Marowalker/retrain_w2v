The valorization
of olive oil mill solid wastes (OMW) has been
addressed by considering it as a possible source of humic-like substances
(HLSs), to be used as auxiliary substances for photo-Fenton, employing
caffeine as a target pollutant to test the efficiency of this approach.
The OMW-HLS isolation encompassed the OMW basic hydrolysis, followed
by ultrafiltration and drying. OMW-HLS structural features have been
investigated by means of laser light scattering, fluorescence, size
exclusion chromatography, and thermogravimetric analysis; moreover,
the capability of OMW-HLS to generate reactive species under irradiation
has been investigated using spin-trap electronic paramagnetic resonance.
The caffeine degradation by means of photo-Fenton process driven at
pH = 5 was significantly increased by the addition of 10 mg/L of OMW-HLS.
Under the mechanistic point of view, it could be hypothesized that
singlet oxygen is not playing a relevant role, whereas other oxidants
(mainly OH• radicals) can be considered as the key
species in promoting caffeine degradation.

Introduction
Food wastes has become a serious environmental
concern in developed
countries. For instance, according to the FUSION project,1 it was estimated that 88 million tonnes of food
are wasted annually in the EU, with associated costs estimated at
143 billion euros, mainly because of households (53%) and production
and processing (30%). Hence, valorization of these residues is an
important goal to be accomplished, in line with European polices leading
to a circular economy.2 As a consequence,
important efforts are being devoted to isolate valuable chemicals
from these wastes, to be employed in different industrial processes
or as a source of energy, as recently reviewed.3

In this context, olive oil mill wastes is a serious
concern in
the Mediterranean Basin countries, where olive oil production is among
the most important activities related to agriculture and food processing.
Commonly, in addition to oil, two different residues are generated
in the process: (a) the olive oil mill wastewater, containing the
water added to the process, the vegetation water of the olives and
water-soluble products (e.g., phenols and polyphenols) and (b) a solid
waste (pomace or olive cake) that contains the solid parts of the
olive fruit.4 In order to decrease the
generation of the highly polluting olive mill wastewaters, the production
process has been modified in some countries, among them Spain, into
a two-phase process that only generates olive oil and a wet solid
residue, called olive wet husk or wet pomace.5 In both cases, the high amount of residues that are produced is
an inconvenience. However, the oil mill wastes could be considered
as a potential source of valuable substances such as phenols and polyphenols,
dietary fibers, animal feed, biofuel, biogas, or enzymes.4,6,7 Hence, strategies for their reuse
are a hot research topic in the Mediterranean countries.8−11

Humic-like substances (HLSs) are among the products that might
be isolated from olive oil mill wastes. HLSs are macromolecules that
share important characteristics with humic substances (HSs), which
are one of the major constituents of natural organic matter, being
its origin decomposition of vegetable or animal.12 Recently, soluble bioorganic substances (SBO) exhibiting
humic-like properties were isolated from urban wastes13 and employed in different fields such as agriculture,14 textile industry,15 or pollution remediation.16

Among
the environmental applications of SBO it can be found the
wastewater treatment. Some research has been performed about the use
of these substances as photoactivators because of the ability of HS
and HLS to generate highly reactive species under irradiation. Some
interesting results have been achieved, although high amounts of these
substances are needed (on the order of g/L).17 Another approach was to employ SBO for the synthesis of hybrid materials,
which can be employed as absorbents and/or heterogeneous photocatalysts.18 Finally, the behavior of SBO as iron complexing
agents has been exploited to drive the photo-Fenton process at mild
pH conditions;19 in this context, HLSs
extracted from the compost have been recently used in the Fenton process
for soil remediation.20

Regarding
these last uses, photo-Fenton is a very efficient photochemical
process for wastewater treatment that employs hydrogen peroxide as
an oxidizing agent, which is catalytically decomposed by iron salts
into more reactive species, such as hydroxyl radical21 or superoxidized iron species (e.g., FeO2+,
Fe5+, and Fe6+).22 The relative role of OH• versus FeO2+ is still debated, and a definite conclusion seems far to be obtained.23−25 The Fenton process is enhanced by light, and solar irradiation can
be employed for this purpose, with a further enhancement of the overall
sustainability of the process.26 However,
a major drawback is the highly acidic pH (2.8) that is required to
maximize the stoichiometric efficiency of the process. One promising
strategy to extend photo-Fenton to milder pH is to form complexes
with iron, which are photoactive and stable at neutral or slightly
acidic pH.27 SBO accomplishes both conditions,
and relatively efficient photo-Fenton can be driven at pH = 5 as recently
studied.19,28−30

As far as we know,
there is no information on the isolation of
HLSs from the olive wet husk. Hence, the aim of this work is to explore
the possibility of obtaining HLSs from olive oil mill solid wastes
(OMW-HLS) and to employ them as auxiliary to drive a photo-Fenton
process at mild pH under sunlight. This result would be very significant
as a hazardous waste very abundant in the Mediterranean Basin would
be valorized to be used in the remediation of polluted water under
solar irradiation. For this purpose, a method of isolation, adapted
from that used for SBO, will be employed. It involves basic digestion
of the solid waste and nanofiltration of the digestate. The obtained
OMW-HLS will be characterized and tested in solar-simulated photo-Fenton
at pH = 5, using caffeine as a probe molecule; this compound has been
chosen because it can be widely found in municipal sewages and even
in aqueous ecosystems.31 Finally, the ability
of OMW-HLS to generate reactive species under irradiation (hydroxyl
radicals or high reactive species that mimic the OH• behavior and singlet oxygen) will also be investigated, in order
to gain further insight into the mechanistic issues of the photochemical
process.

Results and Discussion
Isolation of the OMW-HLS
OMW-HLSs
were isolated from
olive OMW subjected to no aging process. The percentage of humidity
of the initial sample was approximately 60%, whereas the amount of
volatile solids was 95%, confirming the predominance of the organic
matter in the sample. Substances were digested at the basic medium
in order to solubilize the HLS. For this purpose, 125 g of dry sample
(around 300 g of humid product) was introduced in a 2 L open reactor
and a solution of KOH (500 mL, pH = 13 or 11.7) was added. Three different
conditions were used: (a) digestion at pH = 13.0 for one day, (b)
digestion at pH = 13.0 for 4 h, and (c) digestion at pH = 11.7 for
1 day.

No noticeable change in the pH was observed in the experiments
carried out at pH 13.0, whereas a decrease in this value to 7.8 was
observed for the digestion performed at initial pH = 11.7; this is
an indication that although there was an excess of hydroxide in the
first experimental condition, this was not true for the pH = 11.7
reaction. After digestion, samples were first flown through a 100
μm filter in order to remove the remaining suspended solids.
Then, the filtrate was flown consecutively through three different
ceramic membranes, with a size of 300, 150, and 50 kg/mol. The retentate
of each membrane was collected and dried in an air oven. The weight
of each dry sample can be observed in Table 1.

Table 1 Amount of OMW-HLS
Isolated from the
Retentate of Each Ceramic Membrane (the Cutoff Is Given in the Heading
of the Column), for Each Type of Digestiona

a The initial amount
of starting material
was 125 g/L. The percentage of volatile solids is given in brackets.
The total amount of OMW-HLS is given in the last column.

As can be observed, the stronger
the digestion process, the higher
amount of the final product was obtained; this effect is more significant
in the fractions obtained from the retentate of membranes with the
lower pore size. This is in agreement with the leaching of the macromolecular
aggregations present in the starting material to release smaller blocks,
among them, the HLS. This process has not been completely accomplished
at milder pH or at shorter digestion times; in those cases, most of
the organic matter remain as suspended solids and it is removed in
the filtration step.

The yield of the process could be calculated
from the total amount
of dry solid obtained, which was for each experimental condition,
51, 25, and 7% (see results reported in Table 1). However, these results might be misleading,
as an important amount of salts, derived from KOH, are expected to
be incorporated in the final product. In fact, Table 1 shows that the percentage of volatile solids
obtained in each case was in the range 20–50%, in sharp contrast
with the 95% found in the untreated material. For this reason, the
yield was also calculated from a balance including only volatile solids.
In this case, the yields were 18, 7, and 2%. On the basis of these
data, it is clear that strongly basic pH and long digestion times
are required.

Because of the presence of important amounts of
inorganic matter,
namely, salts, OMW-HLS was submitted to further purification. For
this purpose, the sample was dialyzed. The amount of organic carbon
was increased from 12 to 67%. This was also confirmed by thermogravimetric
measurements: in the raw sample, 17% of organic matter was detected,
as well as 14% of humidity; in sharp contrast, the dialyzed sample
showed 80% of organic matter and 6% of humidity.

Characterization
of the OMW-HLS
Spectroscopic measurements
were performed in order to confirm the nature of the obtained materials.
Excitation emission matrixes (EEMs) are good tools for the analysis
of complex samples containing organic matter.32Figure 1 shows the
EEM recorded for the retentate of the 50 and 150 kDa membranes, as
well as for four different humic-(like) substances, namely, commercial
HSs supplied by Aldrich, two standard HSs (Pahokee peat humic acid
and leonardite) and HLS isolated form urban wastes (CVT230).19 In all cases, very similar matrixes were obtained,
with strong signals in the area corresponding to the HSs (emission
in the area 380–550 nm and excitation in 250–400 nm).33 The main similarities were observed with the
synthetic HLSs isolated from urban wastes, as a parallel procedure
was followed to obtain both materials, despite the differences in
the starting materials (in both cases vegetal residues).

Figure 1 EEM of the
different humic or humic-like substances: (A) retentate
of the 150 kg/mol membrane when olive oil mill wastes were used as
staring materials, (B) retentate of the 50 kg/mol membrane when olive
oil mill wastes were used as staring materials, (C) HLS isolated from
urban wastes, (D) commercial humic acids provided by Aldrich, (E)
Pahokee peat humic acid, and (F) leonardite humic acid. X-axis corresponds to the emission wavelength (300–600 nm),
whereas Y-axis shows the excitation wavelength (280–550
nm). In the plot, red colors represent higher intensity of fluoresce,
whereas blue shows lower fluorescence.

The molecular weight was calculated by size exclusion chromatography
(SEC) (see Figure 2 for chromatogram). Retention times were converted into molecular
weight by means of a calibration with standards, as indicated in the Experimental Section. The molecular weight distribution
showed a maximum at 4600 Da in the case of the OMW-HLS isolated from
olive oil mill wastes, and it was increased to 6000 Da for the dialyzed
samples. A weight of 4200 Da was calculated for a commercial humic
acid supplied by Aldrich, which is in agreement with the data provided
in the literature for this substance.34 In general, these results are in line with the molecular weight
reported in the literature for aquatic HSs.35 This relatively low molecular weight seems to be contradictory with
the size of the membranes employed in the isolation process (50–300
kDa). This apparently anomalous results can be understood, taking
into account the ability of HLSs to form supramolecular aggregates.36 Indeed, the size of these aggregates was characterized
by dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements. This method allows
to determine the hydrodynamic radii of the particles. For a concentration
of 300 mg/L of OMW-HLS, a hydrodynamic radius around 400 nm was measured
for both the raw and dialyzed HLSs (420 and 380 nm, respectively).
This value was slightly higher than the one measured for soluble biobased
substances extracted from urban wastes, which was 135 nm.37

HLSs as Auxiliaries for the Photo-Fenton Process
The
ability of OMW-HLSs as auxiliaries to drive the photo-Fenton process
was tested using caffeine as a target pollutant. Figure 3 shows the profile of relative
caffeine concentration versus irradiation time. It can be observed
that photo-Fenton at pH = 5 in the absence of HLS (10 mg/L) was able
to reach some degradation of caffeine; however, results obtained in
the presence of HLSs were systematically more satisfactory. In fact,
the photo-Fenton-like process at pH = 5 in the presence of OMW-HLS
was able to degrade more than 95% of the initial amount of caffeine
in 10 min of irradiation. Very similar results were achieved with
the dialyzed and nondialyzed samples, showing that dialysis of the
OMW-HLS might not be necessary for practical purposes. These results
show that OMW-HLSs are good complexing agents for iron to drive the
photo-Fenton process at mild conditions. In fact, their performance
is slightly better than that
observed for the HLS extracted from urban solid wastes (SBO) (Figure 3), which is the HLS
that has been most widely studied as a complexing agent.29 In fact, analysis of EEMs of SBO by PARAFAC
at different pHs showed the ability of this HLS to complex iron, giving
the highest complexing constant at pH = 5 (log K =
6.55–6.75).33 Finally, dark controls
(iron, iron + HLS, and iron + HLS + hydrogen peroxide) featured negligible
caffeine degradation, indicating the higher efficiency of photo-Fenton
versus the Fenton reaction; these results also allowed ruling out
the effect of absorption of caffeine onto the HLS; also, photolysis
of caffeine in the absence of HLSs was negligible.

Figure 3 Photodegradation of caffeine
(5 mg/L) in a solar simulator at pH
= 5, [Fe2+] = 5 and 60 mg/L of H2O2 under different conditions: in the absence of HLS (⧫), with
10 mg/L of SBO (▲); with 10 mg/L of raw OMW-HLS (■);
and with 10 mg/L of dialyzed OMW-HLS (●).

However, when the concentration of OMW-HLS was increased,
the reaction
rate was observed to decrease (Figure 4). This effect was already observed in the SBO,24 and it was attributed to two different factors:
(a) an inner filter effect due to the overlap of the HLS absorption
spectrum and the irradiation of the source that was studied in detail
with humic acids;38 (b) a competitive effect
between the HLS and the pollutants for the generated reactive species;
additionally, the Fe chelating ability of HLS might result in decreasing
the likelihood of Fe to meet hydrogen peroxide, which is a necessary
step in photo-Fenton. Lower amounts of OMW-HLS were inefficient (data
not shown), most probably because of the lack of complexing agents
to prevent iron inactivation, as also observed with the SBO.28

Figure 4 Photodegradation of caffeine (5 mg/L) in a solar simulator
at pH
= 5, [Fe2+] = 5 and 60 mg/L of H2O2 under different concentrations of OMW-HLS: 10 mg/L (■); 30
mg/L (□); and 60 mg/L (×).

In sharp contrast, OMW-HLSs were not able to degrade caffeine
under
irradiation in the absence of iron and/or hydrogen peroxide (data
not shown), which indicates that OMW-HLSs are not good photosensitizers.
Similar results have been observed for SBO,30 where very high concentrations of this material and long irradiation
times were needed to degrade chlorophenols under UV irradiation.17 The combination of OMW-HLS and hydrogen peroxide
was also proven to be inefficient. Although some iron was found in
the composition of OMW-HLS (0.011% w/w in the raw product and 0.12%
w/w in the dialyzed OMW-HLS), this amount is not able to drive efficiently
a photo-Fenton-like process. This values are far from the 0.7% measured
in the SBO; this difference can be understood when looking at the
starting material that was a complex mixture of urban residues in
SBO, more likely to contain iron than the OMW, which consists of a
single vegetable residue.

Generation of Reactive Species
In
order to explain
the above-described results, mechanistic experiments based on electronic
paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements were performed to investigate
the ability of OMW-HLS to generate reactive oxygen species. The formation
of singlet oxygen was investigated using 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidoxyl
as a probe molecule.39Figure 5 shows that there is a linear
increase in the signal with the concentration of OMW-HLS, indicating
that the formation of this substance is able to sensitize the generation
of singlet oxygen, as previously observed for SBO40 and according to the often reported reactivity of the excited
triplet states of HLS  with dissolved oxygen (3HLS*
+ O2 → HLS + 1O2).41 However, (i) the limited reactivity of singlet
oxygen (the second-order reaction constant of caffeine with 1O2 is kcaffeine,1O2 = 2.9 × 107 M–1 s–1),42 (ii) the scarce photoproduction
of •OH by OMW-HLS alone (vide infra, kcaffeine,•OH = 6.9 × 109 M–1 s–1),42 and (iii) the scarce photoreactivity of the 3HLS* toward caffeine for humic-like compounds under investigation
might explain the bad performance of these substances as photocatalysts.
This is also in line with the recent studies, showing that singlet
oxygen plays only a minor role in the photochemical removal of xenobiotics
in the environment catalyzed by natural organic matter.43

of DMPO 17 mM in a solar box during 3 min at pH = 5 under the following
experimental conditions: (a) H2O2 (2 mg/L) +

mg/L) + H2O2 (2 mg/L) + Fe2+ (2 mg/L);
and (d) OMW-HLS (20 mg/L) + H2O2 (2 mg/L) +
Fe2+ (2 mg/L).

Experiments using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO)
as a
spin trap were performed to investigate the formation of hydroxyl
radicals (or high reactive species able to mimic the oxidative reactivity
of OH•, e.g., one-electron oxidation of DMPO and
successive reaction with water to give the hydroxylated stable adduct).44,45 When irradiating 200 mg/L of OMW-HLS in the presence of DMPO, the
signal attributable to the adduct of this substance and OH• was very low, showing that this substance is not able to generate
high concentration of OH•. Moreover, also, a low
signal ascribable to a C-centered radical is present, probably because
of a limited OMW-HLS oxidation in these conditions. However, when
Fe2+ (2 mg/L) and H2O2 were added,
the signal increased, showing a greatly enhanced generation of reactive
species (mainly the hydroxyl radical). As a matter of fact, those
results were clearly above those obtained in the experiment involving
Fe2+ and H2O2, but without OMW-HLS;
this is in agreement with the need of these materials to enhance photo-Fenton
at pH = 5, as reported above. Also, the detrimental role of an excess
of OMW-HLS can be appreciated: a decrease in the signal is observed
when increasing the concentration of this substance from 20 to 200
mg/L that can be due to the quenching of the most reactive species
such as OH• by the OMW-HLS or a screen effect of
the colored substance that prevents photochemical formation of the
reactive species.

Conclusions
HLSs extracted from
olive oil mill wastes have been demonstrated
as convenient chemical auxiliaries to drive the photo-Fenton process
under mild pH conditions. A simple isolation procedure, adapted from
that developed to obtain HLS from urban residues, has been followed.
This could represent an added value for the management of a residue
such as OMW, in the perspective of a transition to the circular economy,
therefore contributing to the overall sustainability of the olive
oil industry. Furthermore, this result indicate that investigating
other food residues as starting materials seems meaningful.

Regarding OMW-HLS, some aspects require further research, such
as (a) determining the optimal experimental conditions to drive mild
photo-Fenton, (b) to determine the biocompatibility and photostability
of these substances, (c) to gain further insight into the performance
of the different fractions that have been isolated, and (d) to study
mechanistic issues of the process, such as the complexation of iron
with the OMW-HLS or the reactive species that are generated. In particular,
application of PARAFAC analysis to the EEM will provide relevant information
on the composition of the OMW-HLS and differences with other HSs as
well as gaining further insight into the speciation of iron and HLS
in the system.

Experimental Section
Reagents
Caffeine,
employed as a probe substance, was
supplied by Sigma-Aldrich. Heptahydrated iron(II) sulfate, hydrogen
peroxide (30% w/w), potassium hydroxide, and sulfuric acid (96%) were
provided by Panreac. DMPO and 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidone (TMP),
employed in EPR, measurements were also supplied by Sigma-Aldrich.
Water employed in all solutions was of Milli-Q grade.

The olive
oil mill waste was taken from the oil press from Millena, located
in the Valencian Community (Spain). The plant worked in a two-phase
process, and the sample was taken from the wet pomace. The waste was
recent; hence, it was submitted to no composting process. It was immediately
frozen until it was used.

Isolation of the HLS
The pomace
from the oil press
from Millena was first submitted to basic digestion. For this purpose,
0.125 kg (dry weight) of this substance was added to 0.5 L of KOH
with the desired pH value (in the range 11–13). The mixture
was heated to 65 °C and stirred magnetically for the desired
reaction time (4 or 24 h); then, it was left to reach the thermal
equilibrium.

The digested sample was filtered to remove the
remaining suspended solids through filters with decreasing pore size
(100 μm for the smaller one) in order to avoid clogging. The
retained solids were washed with 5 L of KOH solution in order to ensure
the complete recovery of the solubilized organics.

Then, the
liquid sample (filtrate and washing solution) was submitted
to ultrafiltration. For this purpose, ceramic membranes, supplied
by TAMI Industries (Nyons Cedex, France), were used. The experimental
setup consisted of a reservoir from which the sample was flown through
the membrane by means of pump (CAT PUMPS 3C91241). The membrane operated
in a tangential flux of 4 L/m2 h at a pressure of 2 bars
and a temperature of 25 °C. Three different pore sizes were used
(molecular weight cutoff equal to 300, 150, and 50 kDa); in all cases,
the internal diameter was 10 mm, the length 250 mm, and the permeate
area 0.0132 m2. The sample was flown consecutively through
all three membranes. The permeate of the first membrane (300 kg/mol)
was passed through the next one (150 kg/mol), and again this permeate
was flown through the 50 kg/mol membrane. The retentate of each membrane
was accounted for approximately 0.5 L. Finally, all retentates were
dried in an air oven at 65 °C for 24 h in order to obtain the
OMW-HLS.

When a sample nearly free of salts was needed, the
raw OMW-HLSs
were submitted to dialysis. For this purpose, cellulose membranes,
with a pore size of 12 000 Da, supplied by Aldrich were employed.
A very concentrated solution of the sample was prepared (2 g in 15
mL), and it was introduced in the membrane, which was sealed and submerged
in Milli-Q water. The conductivity of water was monitored, and the
accepting solution solvent was changed when this value was constant.
The procedure was repeated until low values of conductivity were reached.
The desalinated sample was then dried in an oven.

Photochemical
Experiments
Photochemical experiments
were performed in a cylindrical Pyrex vessel (55 mm i.d.). For each
experiment, the reactor was loaded with 250 mL of solution containing
caffeine (5 mg/L) and, when needed, OMW-HLS (10 mg/L in most experiments),
iron (5 mg/L), and hydrogen peroxide (60 mg/L). The pH was adjusted
to 5 by adding diluted sulfuric acid. These experimental conditions
are similar to those employed in the experiments involving SBO.28 Samples were irradiated with a solar simulator
(Oriel 81160) equipped with a 300 W xenon short arc lamp; a glass
filter was employed to cutoff the residual radiation below 300 nm.
Samples were periodically withdrawn for analysis; they were diluted
1:1 with methanol to quench further reaction because of the excess
of H2O2; then, they were filtered through polypropylene
filters with a pore diameter of 0.45 μm (VWR Int., Milan) and
analyzed as soon as possible.

Chemical Analyses
SEC was used to determine the distribution
of molecular weights of HLS. A Hitachi Chromaster chromatograph (VWR)
equipped with a Shodex OHpak SB-805 HQ methacrylate column, an oven
to thermostatize the column, an autosampler (Chromaster 5210), pump
(Chromaster 5110), and a UV detector (Chromaster 5410). The eluent
consisted of an isocratic mixture of acetonitrile (30%) and a phosphate
buffer at pH = 7.2 (70%); the flow was 0.8 mL/min. Detection was based
on absorbance at 260 nm. The molecular weight of the HLS was calculated
based on standards of poly-(sodium 4-styrensulfonate) of well-defined
molecular weights, in the range 4230–145 000 Da.

DLS was used to determine the size distribution of the OMW-HLS particles.
For this purpose, solutions containing 300 mg/L of this substance
were prepared and measured with an ALV-NIBS apparatus, equipped with
Ne–He y laser and a digital correlator (tau ALV-5000). Scattered
light was measured during at least 20 s at 298 K.

Fluorescence
emission–excitation matrices were obtained
with a modular fluorimeter QuantaMaster (PTI). Samples were excited
in the range 250–550 nm, and emission was recorded in the range
300–600 nm. A 5 nm bandpass was adopted on both excitation
and emission. Before measurements, samples were diluted with water
to keep absorbance below 1.5 AU at λ = 250 nm.

The concentration
of caffeine was followed by liquid chromatography,
using a Flexar UHPLC FX-10 chromatograph (PerkinElmer) equipped with
a Brownlee Analytical DV C18 column. The apparatus is also equipped
with autosampler (S200 Autosampler Comm kit-1022 PUS), pump (Flexar
FX 10 UHO PUMP), thermostatic oven for the column, and UV detector
(UV/vis KIT-UHPLC Detector Tubing). The mobile phase consisted of
a gradient of acetonitrile (A) and formic acid, 0.01 M (B), that was
changed from 5% of A to 50% of A in 4 min. The flow was 0.3 mL/min.
Detection of caffeine was based on absorption at 275 nm, and the detection
limit was below 100 μg/L. Errors were systematically below 5%.

EPR spectra were recorded at room temperature with a Bruker ESR
300E spectrophotometer; DMPO (5,5-dimethyl-1-pirroline-N-oxide) at
a concentration of 17 mM was used as a probe for the hydroxyl radical
or •OH-like species, and TMP (45 mM) was used for
the detection of singlet oxygen. Measurements were carried out in
quartz capillary tubes. The following parameters were set: the microwave
frequency was 9.78 GHz and the power 5 mW; the modulation frequency
was 100 kHz with an amplitude of 0.4 gauss; the time constant was
40 ms. In all experiments, the spin trap (DMPO or TMP) was added to
the cell before irradiating. The irradiation time was 3 min for hydroxyl
radical determination and 15 min for singlet oxygen, and the spectra
were recorded immediately after the end of irradiation.

Organic
content in the OML-HLS was estimated from the content of
volatile solids. They were determined as the difference of weight
of the dry OMW-HLS before and after calcination at 550 °C in
an oven.

Thermogravimetric analysis was performed in a TA Q600
apparatus
(TA instruments). During the analysis, the temperature was varied
from room temperature to 800 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min,
in air atmosphere.
