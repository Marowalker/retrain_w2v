In
this work, a mild and sustainable catalytic aerobic epoxidation
of alkenes catalyzed by cobalt porphyrin was performed in the presence
of sunflower seeds oil. Under ambient conditions, the conversion rate
of trans-stilbene reached 99%, and selectivity toward
epoxide formation was 88%. The kinetic studies showed that the aerobic
epoxidation followed the Michaelis–Menten kinetics. Mass spectroscopy
and in situ electron spin resonance indicated that linoleic acid was
converted to fatty aldehydes via hydroperoxide intermediates. A plausible
mechanism of epoxidation of alkenes was accordingly proposed.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The
selective epoxidation of alkenes to epoxides has recently attracted
great interest in both academic and industrial fields due to the broad
applications of epoxides in organic synthesis.1−3 Various oxidants,
such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2),4tert-butyl hydroperoxide,5 oxone,6 iodosobenzene,7 and peracids,8 have
been employed as oxidants. Compared to these oxidants, molecular oxygen
(O2) is more attractive species due to its low cost and
environmental friendless. However, it is spin-forbidden between the
triplet oxygen molecule and the singlet organic molecule, which suppresses
the occurrence of direct epoxidation.9

Fortunately, biocatalytic oxyfunctionalizations often help in activating
O2.10,11 These processes utilize co-substrates
like glucose, H2, or ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA)
to in situ generate H2O2. This route is most
convenient to sustain H2O2 at optimal levels.
Some successful biomimetic studies have been attempted to activate
O2 through in situ transformation to hydroperoxides in
the presence of specific co-substrates, such as cumene and ethylbenzene.12−15 However, current methods still require improvements in terms of
high temperature, high pressure, and additional free-radical initiators.
Aldehydes have successfully been used for epoxidation of alkenes through
intermediates active oxygen species (peroxyacid or acylperoxy radical)
under mild conditions (Mukaiyama mechanism).16−18 However, the
rapid exothermic reactions and high cost dramatically limited their
further industrial applications.19

Plant oils consisting of mainly unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs)
are low cost and abundant renewable biomass sources.20 Recently, the transformation of UFAs to diverse valuable
organic acids through selective oxidative cleavage of C–C bond
has attracted increasing attention.21 Linoleic
acid is a major UFA constituent of most plant oils and tall oil (a
by-product of pulping industry).22 Linoleic
acid readily undergoes auto-oxidation under mild conditions because
of its highly active bisallylic C–H bonds.23 For instance, Hauer and co-workers24,25 reported multiple enzyme-catalyzed conversions of linoleic acid
through linoleic acid hydroperoxide (LAOOH) intermediate transformation
into an aldehyde like 9-oxononanoic acid. The latter could further
be converted into azelaic acid, a precursor in the synthesis of advanced
Nylon-6,9.26

Considering in situ
generation of aldehydes from linoleic acid,
the catalytic epoxidation of alkenes could probably be achieved using
sunflower seeds oil due to the presence of a high linoleic acid content
(70 wt %). With this idea in mind, the epoxidation of alkenes catalyzed
by cobalt meso-tetraphenylporphyrin (CoPor) in the
presence of linoleic acid was tested here under ambient conditions.
To the best of our knowledge, aerobic epoxidation of alkenes with
linoleic acid as a co-substrate has so far not been reported. The
aim of this investigation was to develop a green and sustainable catalytic
epoxidation process. It was found that the conversion rate of trans-stilbene could reach 99%, and selectivity toward epoxide
formation was 88% under ambient conditions. To gain a better understanding,
the role of linoleic acid and the catalytic mechanism were explored
by means of mass spectroscopy (MS) and in situ electron spin resonance
(ESR).

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
and Methods
Unless stated
otherwise, all chemical reagents were acquired from commercial sources
and used without further purification. CoPor, FePor, and MnPor (Por: meso-tetraphenylporphyrins) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Edible sunflower seeds oil was obtained from Kerry Oils and Grains
Company. 9-Oxononanoic acid was purchased from Bide Pharmatech Ltd.

The reactants and products were quantified by a GC2010 gas chromatograph
(Shimadzu) equipped with a flame ionization detector and capillary
column (Rtx-5, 30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 μm) and biphenyl-based
internal standard method. The gas chromatograph mass spectrometry
(GC-MS) analyses were performed on a GCMS-2010 plus gas chromatograph
mass spectrometer (Shimadzu) equipped with a capillary column (Rtx-5,
30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) in electron impact mode.
The ESR spectra were recorded on a JEOL JES-FA2000 ESR spectrometer
equipped with a Wilmad WG-810-A quartz flat cell. The mass spectra
were collected on a ThermoFisher TSQ Quantum Ultra electrospray ionization
mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS-MS)
with negative mode. ESI-MS-MS spectra of molecular ions were obtained
using collision-induced dissociation between 15 and 35 V. The electrospray
conditions were set to a nitrogen sheath gas of 45 arb, a spray voltage
of 3.0 kV, a capillary temperature of 300 °C, and a vaporizer
temperature of 200 °C. The photocatalytic synthesis of LAOOH
was performed on a PCX50B Discover multichannel photochemical reaction
system (Beijing Perfect light) equipped with white LED lamps (400–800
nm, 90 mW/cm2).

2.2 Synthesis of Linoleic Acid
Hydroperoxides
(LAOOH)
LAOOH was synthesized according to the literature
with slight modifications.27 Briefly, linoleic
acid (10 g, 35.7 mmol), 1 mL of methylene blue solution (100 mM in
methanol), and chloroform (30 mL) were added to a 60 mL transparent
glass bottle. The mixture was bubbled with O2 for 30 min
then sealed to prevent oxygen from escaping. The mixture was then
stirred at room temperature for 12 h under irradiation using a white
LED lamp. After completion of the reaction, LAOOH was purified by
silica gel column chromatography following the procedure reported
by Kuhn et al.28 Next, the solvents were
removed under reduced pressure to yield LAOOH (24% yield). Afterward,
LAOOH was again dissolved in acetonitrile (10 mL) and stored at −20
°C. The structure of LAOOH was confirmed by ESI-MS. As shown
in Figure S1, m/z = 311.14 was assigned to [M – H]− in LAOOH, and m/z = 293.32 was
attributed to the [M – H2O – H]− ion in the dehydrated product, consistent with previous reports.27,29

2.3 General Procedures of Alkenes Aerobic Epoxidation
For aerobic epoxidation, a mixture containing the alkene (0.5 mmol),
metalloporphyrin catalyst (0.8 mol %), co-substrate (2.5 mmol), acetonitrile
(5 mL), and biphenyl (0.5 mmol) as an internal standard and a magnetic
stirrer were first added to a 10 mL stainless steel autoclave reactor
subjected to 0.5 MPa O2 or a 20 mL two-necked flask with
a reflux condenser under 10 mL/min O2 bubbling. The mixture
was then stirred at 80 °C for 12 h. After completion of the reaction,
the oxidation products of alkenes were analyzed by GC. The organic
acid products issued from linoleic acid oxidative cleavage were also
determined by GC-MS analyses of the esterifiable reaction mixture.
Briefly, the sample (0.5 mL) containing heptadecanoic acid (20 mM)
as an internal standard, methanol (2 mL) containing butylated hydroxytoluene
(0.05 M) as an antioxidant, and concentrated H2SO4 (0.2 mL) were all added to a pressure bottle (25 mL). The mixture
was next degassed by three freeze–pump–thaw cycles then
filled with N2. The obtained mixture was further stirred
at 65 °C for 0.5 h. After methyl esterification, H2O (5 mL) and n-hexane (5 mL) were added to the mixture,
and the supernate was employed in GC-MS analyses.

2.4 In Situ ESR Measurements
ESR spectra
were recorded on a Wilmad WG-810-A quartz flat cell in an O2- or N2-substrated acetonitrile solutions of linoleic
acid (0.5 M) and CoPor (0.8 mM) using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO; 100 mM) as a trapping agent. The ESR analyses
were performed at the microwave frequency of 9.21 GHz and 80 °C.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Catalytic
Aerobic Epoxidation of trans-Stilbene
To
determine the catalytic activities of various
co-substrates, the epoxidation of trans-stilbene
(model substrate, 1a) was first performed under O2 (0.5 MPa) and CoPor catalyst. The main oxidation products
were determined as trans-stilbene epoxide (1b) and benzaldehyde (1c). By comparison, the
epoxidation did not proceed in the presence of ethylbenzene (Table 1, entry 1), which
could be attributed to the high secondary C–H bond dissociation
enthalpy (BDE) of ethylbenzene leading to hard activation at a low
temperature.30 For cumene, the conversion
rate and selectivity toward epoxide formation were estimated to be
13 and 43%, respectively (Table 1, entry 2). This may be ascribed to the low C–H
(tertiary carbon–hydrogen) BDE (355 kJ/mol) of cumene when
compared to that of ethylbenzene (364 kJ/mol).

f Containing 70%
linoleic acid (wt
%).

The catalytic activities
of allylic compounds were subsequently
explored. Using cyclohexene as the co-substrate, the conversion rate
was calculated as 76%, and selectivity toward epoxide formation was
49% (Table 1, entry
3). The allylic position of cyclohexene is considered as the most
active site, where cyclohexenyl hydroperoxide is generated and readily
decomposed into allylic products (alcohol and ketone) (Figure S2).34 Here,
straight-chain allylic compounds, including 2-pentene, oleic acid,
and linoleic acid, were employed as co-substrates. In the presence
of 2-pentene, the conversion rate was estimated to 11%, and selectivity
toward epoxide formation was 27% (Table 1, entry 4). These values enhanced by using
long straight-chain oleic acid instead of 2-pentene after 3 h reaction
time (Table 1, entry
5), which might be linked to rationalized C–H BDEs of 2-pentene
(358 kJ/mol) and oleic acid (331 kJ/mol).

As expected, the conversion
rate of bisallylic linoleic acid after
3 h reaction time reached 99%, and selectivity toward epoxide formation
was 90% (Table 1, entry
6). These values were much larger than those of oleic acid under the
same reaction conditions. This could be due to bisallylic C–H
BDE (294 kJ/mol) in linoleic acid, which was much lower than allylic
C–H BDE (331 kJ/mol) in oleic acid. In addition, because linoleic
acid widely existed in plant oils, linoleic acid was replaced by edible
sunflower seeds oil to achieve 99% conversion and 77% selectivity
(Table 1, entry 7).
Based on the above results, a low C–H BDE of the co-substrate
would benefit the epoxidation of trans-stilbene,
and different epoxidation rates using various co-substrates were confirmed
by kinetic studies (Figure S3).

3.2 Optimized Conditions and Substrate Scope
After affirming
linoleic acid as the optimal co-substrate, epoxidation
of trans-stilbene was performed at atmospheric pressure
by bubbling O2 at 10 mL/min. The conversion rate and selectivity
toward formation of epoxide were estimated to be 99 and 88% (Table 2, entry 1), respectively.
Meanwhile, the reaction mixture was treated with methyl esterification
and then analyzed by GC-MS to determine distribution of oxidative
cleavage products issued from linoleic acid. Figure S4 reveals the main organic acid as n-hexanoic
acid (6% yield) and azelaic acid (11% yield) with some fatty aldehydes
(n-hexanal and 9-oxononanoic acid). Though these
organic acid product yields seemed average due to the great difficulty
in oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids cleavage by O2,21 the coupling of alkene epoxidation and linoleic
acid transformation was still significant.

Subsequently,
the blank experiments revealed that epoxidation of trans-stilbene did not proceed in the absence of linoleic
acid (Table 2, entry
2), and 22% conversion rate with 46% selectivity toward epoxide formation
was achieved in the absence of CoPor (Table 2, entry 3). These values were much less than
those obtained in the presence of CoPor and linoleic acid (Table 2, entry 1). The effects
of reaction factors, such as the catalyst, amount of linoleic acid,
and reaction temperature, on epoxidation of trans-stilbene were also investigated. Compared to FePor and MnPor, CoPor
was found the most effective catalyst for aerobic epoxidation (Table 2, entries 1, 4, and
5). A low catalyst concentration was also found effective (95%), but
poor selectivity toward epoxide formation was noticed (35%) (Table 2, entry 6). The decrease
in linoleic acid concentration to 1.0 mmol resulted in 93% conversion
rate and moderate selectivity (66%) (Table 2, entry 7). On the other hand, decrease in
reaction temperature showed no significant effect on conversion but
could reduce selectivity of epoxide (Table 2, entry 8).

Encouraged by the excellent
catalytic performances of the synergistic
catalytic system (CoPor/linoleic acid) in epoxidation of trans-stilbene, the application scopes of this system were explored. Aromatic trans-β-methyl styrene showed a conversion rate of
99% and selectivity of 81% to corresponding epoxide (Table 2, entry 9). Both alicyclic alkenes
like cyclooctene and norbornene were also catalytically epoxidized
with superior conversion rates and excellent selectivities toward
corresponding epoxides (Table 2, entries 10 and 11). Furthermore, acceptable conversion rate
and good selectivity of corresponding epoxide were obtained over a
terminal alkene (1-decene) due to difficult epoxidation (Table 2, entry 12). For comparison,
the aerobic epoxidations of the above substrates catalyzed by CoPor
in the absence of linoleic acid were also investigated, and the data
are gathered in Table S1. No epoxide was
obtained, indicating that allylic positions in these substrates were
not active sites for epoxidation reactions.

3.3 Biomimetic
Kinetic Studies
To gain
better insights into the distribution of reactants and products as
a function of reaction time, the kinetic profiles in one-pot epoxidation
of trans-stilbene catalyzed by CoPor/linoleic acid
were investigated. As shown in Figure 1, the content of trans-stilbene (1a) quickly decreased and almost vanished after 12 h. Meanwhile,
it was interesting to note that the content of trans-stilbene epoxide (1b) rapidly increased within the
first 6 h and then reached a plateau. Meanwhile, the content of benzaldehyde
(1c) comparatively increased within 4 h and then remained
stable as time further rose. The response of catalytic activity was
also evaluated by calculating the apparent activation energy (Ea) (Figure S5), and
the value of Ea was estimated to be 51
kJ/mol.

Figure 1 Kinetic profiles of trans-stilbene (1a) consumption, trans-stilbene epoxide (1b), and benzaldehyde (1c) formation by CoPor/linoleic
acid. Reaction conditions: trans-stilbene (0.5 mmol),
linoleic acid (2.5 mmol), CoPor (0.8 mol %), biphenyl (0.5 mmol) as
an internal standard, acetonitrile (5 mL), 80 °C, and O2 (10 mL/min).

The steady-state kinetic model
of the catalytic system was subsequently
evaluated by the Lineweaver–Burk plot. The reaction rate (v) was determined through decreasing concentration of trans-stilbene ([S]) (Figure S6). As shown in Figure 2, a good linear relationship (R2 = 0.992) was obtained for 1/v versus 1/[S], suggesting that the catalytic system followed an enzyme-like
kinetics.

Figure 2 Steady-state kinetics of one-pot epoxidation of trans-stilbene catalyzed by CoPor/linoleic acid using the Lineweaver–Burk
plot.

The corresponding maximum rate
(vmax) and Michaelis constant (Km) values
were calculated by means of the Michaelis–Menten equation:35  where v and [S] represent the initial velocity and initial concentration of trans-stilbene, respectively. According to enzyme kinetics, Km stands for the substrate concentration at
which the reaction rate is half of vmax. This represents the affinity of the enzyme to substrate molecules,
where a low Km value signifies high affinity
of the enzyme.

vmax and Km were estimated to be 4.6 mM min–1 and 1.0 M, respectively.
Subsequently, the catalytic constant (Kcat) was calculated to be 0.38 s–1 using the equation Kcat = vmax/E0, where E0 is the
initial concentration of CoPor. Compared to reported values of Km (∼300 μM), vmax (∼100 μM s–1), and Kcat (∼300 s–1) of cytochrome
P450,36 the Km and vmax values obtained in this study
looked much higher, while Kcat was much
lower. This would be induced by the moderate catalytic activity of
CoPor when compared to that of cytochrome P450.

On the other
hand, vmax and Kcat values in this study were close to values
(Vmax = 4.7 mM min–1 and Kcat = 0.39 s–1) reported in our one-pot aerobic oxidation of diphenylmethane catalyzed
by MnPor/cumene,37 while the Km value in this study was significantly different from
the reported Km (0.56 M). The latter was
ascribed to differences in metal centers (Mn and Co) of porphyrin
and substrates (diphenylmethane and trans-stilbene).
In brief, the reaction of one-pot epoxidation of trans-stilbene over CoPor/linoleic acid followed an enzyme-like kinetics,
and the Km value depended on both the
catalyst and substrate.

3.4 Mechanisms Consideration
A series
of control experiments were conducted to distinguish the active sites
of linoleic acid and active intermediates of the catalytic system.
The epoxidation did not proceed in the presence of stearic acid (Table 3, entry 1). Using
linoleic acid methyl ester instead of stearic acid, the conversion
rate of trans-stilbene and selectivity toward epoxide
formation were determined as 99 and 89%, respectively (Table 3, entry 2). These values were
comparable to those obtained with linoleic acid (Table 2, entry 1), suggesting that
allylic C–H bonds were the active sites of linoleic acid. Note
that the initial active site is located on the bisallylic position
of linoleic acid due to its lowest BDE, where the C–H bond
may initially break.

The active intermediates
involved in the catalytic system were
then studied. No product was obtained in the presence of benzaldehyde
(Table 3, entry 3),
indicating that benzaldehyde generated from oxidation of trans-stilbene did not participate in the conversion of trans-stilbene. In situ formed hydroperoxides are generally considered
as oxidants in one-pot aerobic oxidation of organic compounds.15,38 Therefore, epoxidation of trans-stilbene was implemented
under a N2 atmosphere using synthetic LAOOH as an oxidant.
With or without CoPor, the epoxidation did not proceed (Table 3, entries 4 and 5), suggesting
that LAOOH could not be an epoxidizing agent. Some fatty aldehydes
like n-hexanal, 2-heptenal and trans,trans-2,4-decadien-1-al were generated in the absence
or presence of CoPor (Figure S7). These
results indicated that intermediate LAOOH species were thermodynamically
unstable and readily decompose into fatty aldehydes. This could explain
the inactivity of LAOOH in epoxidation of trans-stilbene
under a N2 atmosphere.

Accordingly, in situ formed
fatty aldehydes from LAOOH decomposition
could likely be the active species for epoxidation. As depicted in Figure S4, n-hexanal and 9-oxononanoic
acid were the main fatty aldehydes issued during epoxidation of trans-stilbene catalyzed by CoPor/linoleic acid. Hence, n-hexanal and 9-oxononanoic acid were added to the reaction
as co-substrates. In the presence of linoleic acid and CoPor, the
conversion rate reached 99%, and selectivity toward epoxide formation
was no less than 94%, which were comparative with the results in the
absence of CoPor (Table 3, entry 6 vs 8 and entry 7 vs 9). This clearly demonstrated that
the in situ generated fatty aldehydes as active species could drive
the epoxidation of trans-stilbene under high temperatures
even if there is no catalyst. Therefore, catalyst CoPor is mainly
responsible for the transformation of linoleic acid into fatty aldehydes.

To gain a better understanding of how fatty aldehydes were generated,
the specific structure of in situ formed LAOOH from oxidation of linoleic
acid was further analyzed. Due to instability and complexity of LAOOH,
conventional analytical tools like GC-MS and ultraviolet absorption
are very difficult to use for comprehensive analyses. Soft ionization
techniques, such as electrospray ionization, were recently employed
for lipid oxidation products analysis due to their relevant sensitivities
and specificities.39,40 Therefore, the reaction mixture
of linoleic acid oxidation was measured by both ESI-MS and ESI-MS-MS
to verify the specific structures of LAOOH species.

In the absence
of CoPor (Figure 3A),
the MS spectra showed the presence of reactant
linoleic acid (m/z = 279) and the
formation of LAOOH (m/z = 311),
with an elevated relative abundance of LAOOH. Except LAOOH, the ion
with m/z = 295 was assigned to hydroxy
derivatives of linoleic acid (LAOH),41 while
that with m/z = 293 could be associated
with the dehydrated ion from LAOOH or derivatives of linoleic acids,
such as epoxy and ketone.42,43 In the presence of
CoPor, the MS spectra displayed an evident decrease in relative abundance
of LAOOH (m/z = 311) and an increase
in relative abundance of LAOH (m/z = 295) (Figure 3B).
These results suggested the probable decomposition of LAOOH into LAOH
in the presence of CoPor.

Figure 3 ESI-MS spectra (negative mode) of the reaction
mixture of linoleic
acid oxidation in the (A) absence or (B) presence of CoPor. Reaction
conditions: linoleic acid (2.5 mmol), CoPor (0.004 mmol), 80 °C,
acetonitrile (5 mL), O2 (10 mL/min), and 12 h.

The ESI-MS-MS spectra of LAOOH (m/z = 311) were then performed to unambiguously distinguish
the isomers
of LAOOH. Without CoPor (Figure 4A), the ESI-MS-MS spectra of the ion with m/z = 311 revealed ion fragments with m/z = 185 and 195, related to C9-linoleic acid hydroperoxide
(9-LAOOH) and C13-linoleic acid hydroperoxide (13-LAOOH),44−46 respectively. Other ion fragments were also obtained at m/z 171, 183, 197, 211, and 223, derived
from cleavage of C9–C10, C10–C11, C11–C12, C12–C13,
and C13–C14 bonds, respectively. These ion fragments indicated
the presence of 9-, 10-, 11-, 12-, and 13-LAOOH,46 respectively. Due to a high relative abundance of 9-LAOOH
(m/z = 171) and13-LAOOH (m/z = 223), thus 9-LAOOH and 13-LAOOH were
the predominant LAOOH species in the absence of CoPor.

Figure 4 ESI-MS-MS spectra (negative
mode) of ion with m/z 311 observed
in ESI-MS spectra of reaction mixtures
of linoleic acid oxidation in the (A) absence or (B) presence of CoPor.

By adding CoPor (Figure 4B), the ESI-MS-MS spectra of the ion with m/z = 311 exhibited the presence of 9-LAOOH
(m/z = 171 and 185). The ions with m/z = 183, 197, and 211 stood for the presence
of 10-, 11-, and 12-LAOOH, respectively. Compared to profiles obtained
in the absence of CoPor, the peaks of ions with m/z = 195 and 223 vanished from the spectra, indicating
the absence of 13-LAOOH. This may be ascribed to the easy decomposition
of 13-LAOOH in the presence of CoPor. In the epoxidation of trans-stilbene catalyzed by CoPor/linoleic acid, n-hexanal and 9-oxononanoic acid were the dominant fatty
aldehydes (Figure S4), which would derive
from the decomposition of 13-LAOOH and 9-LAOOH,25,47,48 respectively. These findings further demonstrated
that 9-LAOOH and 13-LAOOH were the dominant LAOOH species in the CoPor/linoleic
acid catalytic system.

LAOOH is known as the major initial product
of free-radical-initiated
peroxidation of linoleic acid.39 Accordingly,
in situ ESR experiments by DMPO as a free-radical trapping agent were
conducted to gain insights into free-radical mechanisms. No signal
was observed in the absence of CoPor (Figure S8), suggesting that CoPor played an important role in the aerobic
oxidation of linoleic acid. Upon addition of CoPor, a specific signal
(black club suit) appeared and was characterized by hyperfine coupling
constants (aN = 13.0 G, aH(β) = 10.5 G, and g = 2.0022)
(Figure 5A). This agreed
well with the spectrum of computer stimulation (Figure S9) and was assigned to the DMPO spin adduct of the
linoleic acid-derived alkylperoxyl radical (LAOO·).49 This suggested that LAOO· was the dominant
radical species formed during the initial stage of linoleic acid oxidation.

or (B) absence of O2 at DMPO (100 mM), CoPor (0.8 mM),

linoleic acid (2.5 mmol), 80 °C, acetonitrile (5 mL), TEMPO (1.0
mmol), O2 (10 mL/min), and 12 h.

LAOO· is known to derive from the initial linoleic acid-derived
alkyl radical (LA·), formed by homolytic cleavage of the C–H
bond. Therefore, in situ ESR tests were carried out under a N2 atmosphere to obtain LA· radicals. The signal was hardly
detected during the first minute, but the signal (⧫) gradually
strengthened after 11 min (Figure 5B). The signal (⧫) characterized by hyperfine
coupling constant (aN = 16.2 G, aH(β) = 25 G, and g =
2.0012) and in accordance with that of computer simulation (Figure S10) was assigned to the DMPO adduct of
carbon-centered LA·.50 The signal
(black spade suit) characterized by a hyperfine coupling constant
(aN = 15.1 G) was assigned to the DMPO
derivative,51 probably attributed to the
presence of trace O2.

The ESI-MS analyses of radical
trapping with TEMPO were conducted,
and the results are gathered in Figure 5. Without CoPor, ions with m/z 436, 452, and 468 were formed and assigned to TEMPO adducts
of LA·, linoleic acid-derived alkoxyl radical (LAO·), and
LAOO·, respectively (Figure 5C). Among these ions, the LAOO· adduct (m/z = 468) agreed well with ESR spectral
data (Figure 5A). This
indicated its strong relative abundance and LAOOH as the major intermediate,
in accordance with ESI-MS spectra obtained without CoPor (Figure 3A).

In the
presence of CoPor, the same ions at m/z = 436, 452, and 468 were also generated, but the relative
abundance of LAOO• adduct (m/z = 468) obviously decreased, and that of LAO· adduct (m/z = 452) increased (Figure 5D). Hence, LAOOH would readily
be decomposed by CoPor into LAO· through O–O bond homolytic
cleavage.52,53 With respect to the strongest relative abundance
of LAOH in the presence of CoPor (Figure 3B), LAOOH probably converted into LAOH via
LAO· through H-abstraction. In addition, LAO· would likely
to be converted into the corresponding fatty aldehyde through homolytic
β-scission.54−56

Based on the above discussion, a plausible
mechanism of trans-stilbene epoxidation mediated
by CoPor/linoleic acid
was proposed (Scheme 1). Considering the lowest BDE of the bisallylic C–H bond of
linoleic acid, the C–H bond on C11 would first undergo dehydrogenation
to provide an alkyl radical (LA·, a), delocalized over five carbons
from C-9 to C-13.57 LA· tended to
delocalize its unpaired electron over either position C13 or C9, forming
13-LA· or 9-LA·. The subsequent oxygen insertion at corresponding
positions resulted in the formation of 13-LAOO· and 9-LAOO·
(b) followed by H-abstraction to yield two main hydroperoxides (13-LAOOH
and 9-LAOOH, c). Even in the presence of CoPor, both hydroperoxides
hardly induced epoxidation of trans-stilbene into
epoxide (Table 3, entry
5).

Scheme 1 Plausible Mechanism Involved in One-Pot Epoxidation of trans-Stilbene Catalyzed by CoPor/Linoleic Acid
a, b, and d were verified
by ESR spectra and ESI-MS spectra with TEMPO as the trapping agent.
c was verified by ESI-MS and ESI-MS-MS. e and f were verified by GC-MS.

Inversely, the hydroperoxides were decomposed
into fatty aldehydes
(n-hexanal (A) and 9-oxononanoic acid
(B), e) in the absence of CoPor through thermic decomposition,47 accounting for 22% conversion rate of trans-stilbene in blank of the CoPor experiment (Table 2, entry 3). In the
presence of CoPor, the decomposition of hydroperoxides into alkoxyl
radicals (13-LAO· and 9-LAO·, d) was facilitated through
O–O homolytic cleavage. At the same time, Co(II)Por was converted
into the cobalt hydroxide complex (Co(III)Por-OH), which was inactive
for the epoxidation of trans-stilbene.58 Co(III)Por-OH further reacted with in situ generated
peracid (h), thus achieving regeneration of the catalyst Co(II)Por
along with the formation of acylperoxyl radicals (g).58 Then, alkoxyl radicals (d) were converted into A and B through homolytic β-scission. Finally,
fatty aldehydes (A and B) could efficiently
achieve epoxidation of trans-stilbene through Mukaiyama
mechanism in the presence of O2 and a high temperature,
as described below (e → j). C–H bonds on acyl groups
of fatty aldehydes broke at a high temperature to afford acyl radical
(f), which were then inserted by O2 to generate acylperoxyl
radicals (g). On the one hand, acylperoxyl radicals (g) could directly
epoxidize trans-stilbene to the epoxide along with
the formation of carboxyl radicals (i), which could capture an additional
hydrogen atom to generate the corresponding acids (n-hexanoic acid (C) and azelaic acid (D),
j). On the other hand, acylperoxyl radicals (g) could capture an additional
hydrogen atom to generate the peracid (h), which also could directly
epoxidize trans-stilbene to the epoxide along with
the formation of corresponding acids (n-hexanoic
acid (C) and azelaic acid (D), j).

4 Conclusions
An efficient and mild catalytic epoxidation
of alkenes catalyzed
by cobalt porphyrin in the presence of sunflower seeds oil containing
70 wt % linoleic acid as a co-substrate was successfully performed.
Using trans-stilbene as a model substrate, the influences
of various reaction parameters, such as the catalyst type, its concentration,
and reaction temperature, on both activity and selectivity toward
epoxide formation were investigated. Under ambient conditions, the
conversion rate of trans-stilbene and selectivity
toward epoxide formation were estimated to be 99 and 88%, respectively.
A biomimetic kinetic model was established accordingly and revealed
that epoxidation of trans-stilbene followed an enzyme-like
kinetics. The ESI-MS-MS and in situ ESR studies suggested that linoleic
acid was in situ converted to fatty aldehydes via hydroperoxide intermediates.
Epoxidation of alkenes was achieved from fatty aldehydes through Mukaiyama
mechanism in the presence of dioxygen and CoPor. Overall, the proposed
route is green, mild, and sustainable for the development of an alkene
epoxidation process.
