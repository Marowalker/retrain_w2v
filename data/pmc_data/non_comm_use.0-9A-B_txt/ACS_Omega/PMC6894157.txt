A series of novel trimethoxyphenyl-derived chalcone-benzimidazolium
salts were synthesized. The biological properties of the compounds
were screened in vitro against five different human tumor cell lines.
The results suggest that the 5,6-dimethyl-benzimidazole or 2-methyl-benzimidazole
ring as well as the 2-naphthylmethyl, 4-methylbenzyl, or 2-naphthylacyl
substituent at position-3 of the benzimidazole ring was important
to the cytotoxic activity. Notably, (E)-5,6-dimethyl-3-(naphthalen-2-ylmethyl)-1-(3-(4-(3-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)acryloyl)phenoxy)propyl)-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-3-ium bromide (7f) was more selective to HL-60, MCF-7, and SW-480 cell lines
with IC50 values 8.0-, 11.1-, and 5.8-fold lower than DDP.
Studies of the antitumor mechanism of action showed that compound 7f could induce cell-cycle G1 phase arrest and apoptosis in
SMMC-7721 cells.

Introduction
Chalcones are one of the most important
structural scaffolds in
natural products.1 The chalcone family
exhibits a wide range of remarkable biological activities,2−12 for example, anti-inflammatory,3 antihistaminic,4 hypnotic,5 antispasmodic,6 antioxidant,7 antiobesity,8 antiprotozoal,9 and
antitumor activities.10−12 Chalcones are excellent anticancer scaffolds and
have attracted much attention in the anticancer domain. The molecular
mechanism of some chalcone-based anticancer compounds has been studied
at the cellular level over the past two decades.1Figure 1 shows that chalcones 1a and 1b are potent
inhibitors of tubulin polymerization.13,14 The IC50 value of compound 1a against the P388 murine
leukemia cell line is 2.6 nM, and compound 1b has an
IC50 of 0.21 nM against the K562 human chronic myelogenous
leukemia cell line. Their phosphates are under preclinical evaluation
for cancer as prodrugs.11

Figure 1 Representative structures
of chalcone, imidazolium salts, and trimethoxyphenyl-derived
compounds.

Imidazole and their derivatives have attracted
much interest due
to their broad and interesting biological and pharmacological activities,15−20 especially antitumor activity.21−23 For instance, Lepidiline
A and B are isolated from the roots of Lepidium meyenii and show potent cytotoxic activity against four human cancer cell
lines, that is, bladder carcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, breast
carcinoma, and ovarian carcinoma.24 In
our previous work, a library of novel imidazolium salts was synthesized,
and their antitumor activities were evaluated.25−29 Many compounds showed potential antitumor activity,
such as NTIB.25 Studies on molecular targets
and docking calculations suggested that these imidazolium salt hybrids
may be mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling inhibitors.25−27

In addition, the trimethoxyphenyl group is a well-known fragment
in some natural tubulin polymerization inhibitors,30−32 such as CA-4,30 colchicine,31 and
podophyllotoxin32 (Figure 1). The 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl group can be
linked to another aromatic system and is the only well-defined pharmacophore
for the inhibition of tubulin polymerization.33

Currently, combination chemotherapy, that is, using two or
more
than two drugs with different molecular mechanisms or targets in treatment,
is one of the most important methods to treat cancer.34 However, drug combination regimens always increase hospitalizations,
hematological toxicities, and other side effects.35 Molecular hybridization, involving the rational design
of new chemical entities by the fusion of two or more than two drugs,
has been one of the most potent strategies for drug discovery during
the past decades.36−40 Therefore, the design of a single anticancer drug that combines
two or more than two pharmacophores with different molecular mechanisms
in one molecule is a very important assignment for pharmaceutical
synthetic scientists. Considering the anticancer activities of chalcone-derived
compounds, naturally occurring trimethoxyphenyl-derived compounds,
and the potent cytotoxic activities of natural and synthetic imidazolium
salts, we synthesized a number of novel hybrid compounds with chalcone
units (shown in red in Figure 1), trimethoxyphenyl groups (shown red in Figure 1), and N-benzyl-
or phenacyl-substituted imidazole moieties (shown in blue in Figure 1). Although imidazothiazole-chalcone
derivatives were synthesized and found to exhibit potent anticancer
effect,11 to the best of our knowledge,
no reports concerning antitumor activity of trimethoxyphenyl-derived
chalcone-imidazolium salts have yet been reported.

Here, we
describe our efforts toward the synthesis and cytotoxic
activity evaluation of novel trimethoxyphenyl-derived chalcone-imidazolium
salts with the ultimate aim of developing potent antitumor agents.
The resulting compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxic activity
toward five different human tumor cell lines.

Results and Discussion
Chemistry
The 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde 2 and 4′-hydroxyacetophenone 3 were selected as
the starting materials for the syntheses of a series of trimethoxyphenyl-derived
chalcone-imidazolium salts (7a–j, 8a–j, and 9a–j, Scheme 1). Scheme 1 shows
that the trimethoxyphenyl-derived (E)-chalcone 4 was synthesized via a NaOH-catalyzed Claisen–Schmidt
condensation between 4′-hydroxyacetophenone and 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde
in 66% yield. The (E)-chalcone 4 was
alkylated with 1,3-dibromopropane in the presence of NaH to afford
compound 5 in 63% yield. The respective chalcone-imidazoles 6a–c were obtained in the presence of
K2CO3 in acetone with 66–75% yield. Finally,
trimethoxyphenyl-derived chalcone-imidazolium salts (7a–j, 8a–j, and 9a–j) were prepared with excellent yield
(75–91%) by treating chalcone–imidazole hybrid 6 with various alkyl halides in acetone or toluene at 80 °C.
The detailed structures and yields of trimethoxyphenyl-derived chalcone-imidazolium
salts are shown in Table 1.

To verify the structures of the chalcone-imidazolium
salt derivatives,
imidazolium salt 8d was selected as a representative
compound and characterized by X-ray crystallography (CCDC 1589720)
as shown in Figure 2.

Cytotoxic Activity and Structure–Activity Relationship
(SAR)
The cytotoxic potential of all newly synthesized hybrid
compounds was evaluated in vitro against a panel of human tumor cell
lines according to procedures described in the literature.41,42 The panel consisted of leukemia (HL-60), myeloid liver carcinoma
(SMMC-7721), lung carcinoma (A549), breast carcinoma (MCF-7), and
colon carcinoma (SW480). Cisplatin (DDP) was used as the reference
drug. The results are summarized in Table 2 (here, the IC50 value is defined
as the concentration corresponding to 50% growth inhibition).

b Cytotoxicity as IC50 for
each cell line; this is the concentration of compound that reduced
the optical density of treated cells by 50% with respect to untreated
cells using the [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide] (MTT) assay.

Table 2 shows that
the structures of the chalcone-imidazoles have a significant effect
on the cytotoxic activity. Chalcone-imidazoles 6a–c showed good activity for HL-60, SMMC-7721, A-549, MCF-7,
and SW480 cell lines at a concentration of 20 μM. The IC50 value was 1.08–5.87 μM on the study of five
human tumor cell lines, and this was more active than DDP. More interestingly,
chalcone-imidazolium salts (7a–j, 8a–j, and 9a–j) exhibited a degree of cytotoxic activity or higher cytotoxic
activity. The difference in cytotoxicity between neutral compounds
and imidazolium salts may be due to changes in molecular structure,
charge distribution, and water solubility.43

In terms of the substituents with different positions of benzimidazole
rings, the imidazolium salts 7a, 7d–g, 7i, and 7j having two methyl
groups at 5,6-position of the benzimidazole ring showed strong cytotoxic
activity against five cell lines. In particular, compounds 7f and 7j showed the best cytotoxic activity against leukemia
cell lines (HL-60 and IC50 values of 0.83 and 0.59 μM,
respectively). Simultaneously, the benzimidazolium salts 8a–c, 8e–g, 8i, and 8j having the methyl group at 2-position
of the benzimidazole ring exhibited moderate cytotoxic activity to
the five cell lines. For example, the benzimidazolium salts 8a, 8b, 8c, and 8i have
IC50 values of 2.49, 2.42, 3.07, and 1.25 μM, respectively.
These showed much higher inhibitory activity in vitro than DDP for
breast cancer (MCF-7). However, most of the benzimidazolium salts
without any substituent at the benzimidazole ring showed lower inhibitory
in vitro activity than those with benzimidazolium salts at the 2-position
or 5,6-position of the benzimidazole ring.

In terms of the substituents
with different positions of imidazolium
salts, the imidazolium salts 7b, 7c, 7h, 8h, 9a–c, and 9h have a formyl substituent and show a lack of
activity against five tumor cell lines. Compounds 7d, 7e, 7g, 8d, 8e, 8g, 9d, 9e, and 9f have
a benzyl substituent at the 3-position of the benzimidazole ring and
are more effective than the above-mentioned formyl-substituted imidazolium
salt derivatives. In particular, compounds 7f, 8f, 9f, 7i, 8i, and 9i have a naphthylmethyl or 4-methylbenzyl substituent at
the 3-position of the imidazole ring and exhibit similar or higher
cytotoxic activity in vitro compared with DDP. Interestingly, the
hybrid compounds 7f and 7j with naphthylmethyl
and 4-methylbenzyl substituents at the 3-position of 5,6-dimethyl-benzimidazole
were the most potent derivatives against the five human tumor cell
lines with an IC50 value of 0.59–8.15 μM;
they were more active than DDP. We note that the heterozygous compound 7f selectively treated leukemia (HL-60, IC50 value
of 0.83 μM), breast cancer (MCF-7, IC50 value of
1.57 μM), and colon cancer (SW480, IC50 value of
2.92 μM) with 8.0-fold, 11.1-fold, and 5.8-fold lower concentrations
than DDP, respectively.

This finding suggests that the existence
of the 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole
or 2-methyl-benzimidazole ring as well as substitution of the imidazolyl-3-position
with a naphthylmethyl or benzyl group was important for antitumor
activity. In general, the structure–activity relationship (SAR)
results are summarized in Scheme 2.

Scheme 2 Structure Analysis of Trimethoxyphenyl-Derived Chalcone-Benzimidazolium
Salts
Apoptosis
SMMC-7721 cells were exposed to increasing
concentrations of compound 7f, and cell apoptosis was
determined with annexin V–fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/propidium
iodide (PI) double-labeled cell cytometry. Figure 3 shows that the apoptotic cell rates were
14.95 ± 0.89 and 97.43 ± 5.96% after treatment of SMMC-7721
cells with compound 7f at 5 and 10 μM for 48 h,
respectively. These were statistically significantly different from
the control (2.35 ± 0.22%).

apoptosis of SMMC-7721
cells. (A) Cells were treated with 5 and 10 μM compound 7f for 48 h. Cell apoptosis was determined by the annexin

apoptosis.

Cell-Cycle Analysis
The results of cell-cycle analysis
on SMMC-7721 cells treated with compound 7f are presented
in Figure 4. Compared
with the control cells, the percentage of cells in the G1 phase increased
during incubation with compound 7f in a dose-dependent
manner. Compound 7f treatment caused 83.14 ± 0.48%
cells in the G0/G1 phase versus controls showing 62.20 ± 0.68%.
In contrast, the fractions of cells in the S and G2/M phases decreased
slightly from 14.09 ± 0.17 to 9.40 ± 0.23% and 2.57 ±
0.39 to 4.17 ± 0.19%, respectively. These data showed that compound 7f may induce G1 phase arrest in the cell cycle (Figure 4).

(A) Cells were treated with 2.5 and 5 μM of compound 7f for 24 h. Cell cycle was determined by PI staining and cell cytometry.
(B) Percentage of cells in different phases was quantified. At least
three independent experiments were performed, and data from one representative
experiment is shown. Data represents the mean ± standard deviation
(S.D.) of three independent experiments.

Docking Analysis
In our previous work, we found that
tailored imidazolium salts might be potential inhibitors of mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling.25−27 To rationalize the observed
SARs for this series of compounds, we attempted to dock hybrid 7f with some crystal structure of proteins in this signaling
pathway, for example, mTORC1, mTORC2, and PI3K, using Autodock 4.2.
Although compound 7f could not dock with mTORC1 or mTORC2,
it could dock nicely with PI3Kγ (PDB code 3PRZ). Figure 5 shows that hybrid 7f is predicted to engage a hydrogen bond with ASN498 using phenol
oxygen and a hydrogen bond with GLY970 using methoxyl oxygen. The
results also show that hybrid 7f can foster van der Waals
interactions with the gap bounded by ASN971, LYS875, GLY489, SLR488,
ASP500, ASN498, PHE497, THR1043, MET1039, GLN1041, PRO1040, GLN840,
and GLY970. These favorable interactions contribute to a good docking
score (AutoDock binding energy is −7.47 kcal/mol) and an excellent
inhibitory activity. These interesting findings are useful for further
studies.

Figure 5 Model of compound 7f docked into PI3Kγ.

Conclusions
Compounds 7f, 7j, 8f, 8i, and 8j, with a 5,6-dimethyl-benzimidazole
or 2-methyl-benzimidazole ring, and 2-naphthylmethyl substituent,
4-methylbenzyl or 2-naphthylacyl substituent at position-3 of the
benzimidazole ring, were found to be the most potent derivatives.
Notably, compounds 8f and 8i were the most
potent derivative against five human tumor cell lines with IC50 values below 6.70 μM. These values showed more selectivity
toward HL-60 and MCF-7 cell lines. Compound 7f was more
selective to HL-60, MCF-7, and SW-480 cell lines with IC50 values that were 8.0-fold, 11.1-fold, and 5.8-fold lower than DDP,
respectively. Studies of the antitumor mechanism of action showed
that compound 7f could induce cell-cycle G1 phase arrest
and apoptosis in SMMC-7721 cells. The trimethoxyphenyl-derived chalcone-benzimidazolium
salts 7f, 7j, 8f, 8i, and 8j are promising leads for further structural
modifications guided by our SARs.

Experimental Section
General Methods
Melting points were obtained on an
XT-4 melting-point apparatus and were uncorrected. Proton nuclear
magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectra were recorded on a
Bruker Avance 400 spectrometer at 400 MHz. Carbon-13 nuclear magnetic
resonance (13C NMR) was recorded on a Bruker Avance 400
spectrometer at 100 MHz. Chemical shifts are reported as δ values
in parts per million (ppm) relative to tetramethylsilane for all of
the recorded NMR spectra. High-resolution mass spectra were taken
on an AB QSTAR Pulsar mass spectrometer. Silica gel (200–300
mesh) for column chromatography and silica GF254 for thin-layer
chromatography (TLC) were produced by Merck KGaA (Germany). All of
the air- or moisture-sensitive reactions were conducted under an argon
atmosphere. Starting materials and reagents used in the reactions
were obtained commercially from Acros, Sigma-Aldrich, and Fluka and
were used without purification unless otherwise indicated.

resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 5 min. The 4′-hydroxyacetophenone 3 (6.86 g, 50.40 mmol) was then added to the reaction, and
the resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 13 days.
The reaction was quenched with HCl (2 N, 150 mL), and the resulting

Synthesis of Compound 5
Compound 4 (4.95 g, 15.75 mmol) was dissolved in dimethylformamide
(120 mL) in a 250 mL round-bottom flask. The NaH (0.40 g, 16.60 mmol)
was added under N2 protection and ice bath. After stirring
for 15 min, the mixture was slowly warmed to room temperature. After
stirring for 30 min, 1,3-dibromopropane (8.00 mL, 78.73 mmol) was
added in one portion. The reaction was then monitored by TLC using
ethyl acetate/petroleum ether (1:2 v/v) as the solvent system. After
the reaction was complete, the reaction was quenched with HCl (2 N,
10 mL), and the residue was diluted with EtOAc (300 mL). The organic
layer was washed with water and brine, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and concentrated. The residue was purified
by column chromatography (silica gel, petroleum ether 60–90
°C/ethyl acetate = 4:1) to afford compound 5 (4.34

General Procedure for the Synthesis of Compounds 6a–c
A mixture of the previous bromide 5 (2 mmol), K2CO3 (12 mmol), and substituted
imidazole (3 mmol) was stirred in acetone (20 mL) at 60 °C in
a tube for 12–24 h. After cooling to room temperature, the
solvent was concentrated and the residue was diluted with EtOAc (30
mL). The organic layer was washed with water (20 mL) and brine (20
mL), dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and concentrated.
The residue was purified by column chromatography (silica gel, petroleum
ether 60–90 °C/ethyl acetate = 1:2) to give the yellow
solid compounds 6a–c in 66–75%
yield.

Cytotoxicity Assay
The assay was performed in five
cell lines (HL-60, SMMC-7721, A549, MCF-7, and SW480). Cells were
cultured at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 medium supplemented
with 10% fetal serum and dispersed in replicate 96-well plates. Chalcone-benzimidazolium
hybrids were then added. After 48 h exposure to the compounds, cell
viability was determined by the [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide] (MTT) cytotoxicity assay by measuring the absorbance at 570
nm with a microplate spectrophotometer. Each test was performed in
triplicate.

Flow Cytometric Evaluation of Apoptosis
To analyze
the cells for apoptosis, cells were plated and allowed to adhere overnight.
The SMMC-7721 cells were treated with 0, 5, or 10 μM 7f for 0–48 h. Cells treated with vehicle alone (100% ethanol)
were used as a control. Cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density
of 1.2 × 106 cells/well. After treatment, cells were
then collected and washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) and resuspended in 100 μL of a binding buffer containing
annexin V–FITC and propidium iodine (PI). This step was followed
by incubation with FITC-conjugated annexin V and propidium iodide
(PI) for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. The fluorescence
intensity was measured using the FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences,
Franklin Lakes, NJ). The percentages of cells in different phases
were quantified, and at least three independent experiments were performed.
The data of one representative experiment are shown. The data represent
the mean ± S.D. of three
independent experiments.

Cell-Cycle Assay
To analyze the DNA content by flow
cytometry, cells were collected and washed twice with PBS. Cells were
fixed with 70% ethanol overnight. Fixed cells were washed with PBS
and then stained with a 50 μg/mL propidium iodide (PI) solution
containing 50 μg/mL RNase A for 30 min at room temperature.
Fluorescence intensity was analyzed by the FACSCalibur flow cytometer
(BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). The percentage of cells distributed
in the different phases of the cell cycle was obtained using ModFIT
LT 2.0.

Molecular Modeling
Chalcone-benzimidazolium hybrid 7f was docked into PI3Kγ, a crystal obtained from the
complex (PDB code: 3PRZ) of PI3Kγ with 4-amino-2-methyl-N-(1H-pyrazol-3-yl)quinazoline-8-carboxamide by means of AutoDock
4.2. A grid of 126, 126, and 126 points was constructed, the x, y, and z directions
of which were centered on 32.02, −0.082, and 25.843. A grid
spacing of 0.736 Å and a distance-dependent function of the dielectric
constant for the energetic map calculations were used in this modeling.
The Lamarckian genetic algorithm was selected as docking simulations
of the compounds. A protocol with an initial population of 150 randomly
placed individuals, a mutation rate of 0.02, an elitism value of 1,
a crossover rate of 0.8, and a maximum number of 250 million energy
evaluations was used in the calculations. Fifty independent docking
runs were carried out between PI3Kγ and compound 7f. The resulting conformations, differing by 1.6 Å in positional
root-mean-square deviation, were clustered by selecting the most populated
cluster with the best energy in all of the cases.44
