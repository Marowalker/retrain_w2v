Second-generation
biofuels are a complex mixture of organic compounds
that can be further processed to hydrocarbon fuels and other valuable
chemicals. One such chemical is levulinic acid (IUPAC name: 4-oxo
pentanoic acid), which is a highly versatile ketoacid obtained from
cellulose present in agricultural byproducts. For oxygen-containing
compounds that decompose at elevated temperatures and pressures, determining
the vapor–liquid equilibria data at high temperatures via the
experimental route may be challenging. The molecular simulation approach
is a cost-effective tool to obtain the necessary data while also allowing
us to understand the microscopic origins of macroscopic observable
properties. We have employed the transferable potential for phase
equilibria-united atom force field to describe the interactions in
this system with the parameters for a torsional interaction that are
not reported in the literature (levulinic acid is a ketoacid) being
determined from density functional theory calculations. We have verified
our parameterization via density computations in the isothermal–isobaric
ensemble and by comparing our simulation results with the corresponding
data from experiments reported in the literature. We have performed
grand-canonical transition-matrix Monte Carlo simulations in the temperature
range from 580 to 690 K to estimate the vapor–liquid coexistence
curves in the temperature–density plane and the Clapeyron plots.
From this data, the critical point (TC = 755 K, ρC = 285.4 kg/m3, and PC = 30.57 bar) has been estimated, and this
may be used as input to the equations of state employed in process
simulation software for design of industrial separation processes
including those for “biorefining”. As levulinic acid
is a “ketoacid”, hydrogen bonding occurs, and the liquid
phase structure has also been studied using radial distribution functions.

1 Introduction
Levulinic acid is a “ketoacid”
obtained by conversion
of lignocellulosic biomass and finds use in a variety of chemical
applications, for example, as a precursor for the synthesis of liquid
transportation fuels.1−17 Levulinic acid is also a precursor for the synthesis of value-added
chemicals, such as methyltetrahydrofuran, which is an important oxygenated
fuel additive and is also employed as a solvent.2 The commercial value of levulinic acid is further enhanced
as it is used in the production of a broad-spectrum herbicide, d-aminolevulinic acid.2 Also,
the nontoxic levulinic acid is being investigated as a reactant in
the manufacture of diphenolic acid, which in turn will be used as
a replacement for the toxic bisphenol as a plasticizer.2 A cost-effective production technique for levulinic
acid from renewable feedstocks including agricultural byproducts has
been developed and a 1 ton/day facility is operational in the United
States.2 Ghorpade and Hanna noted that
the levulinic acid thus produced can be isolated using filtration
followed by vacuum steam distillation or by solvent extraction.9 The design and optimization of these separation
processes (and also other processes) require accurate knowledge of
thermodynamic properties, including vapor–liquid coexistence
properties, of levulinic acid (besides that of its mixtures). Process
simulation software generally employs the equation-of-state approach,
which requires the pure component critical properties as input. However,
despite the industrial importance of this organic compound, experimental
data exists only for low temperatures11,18 because of
the fact that larger oxygen-containing compounds undergo thermal decomposition
at elevated temperatures.19 The accuracy
of the molecular simulation approach depends only on the force field
(and its parameterization) employed and can easily circumvent this
issue to determine the thermodynamic properties at high temperatures.19 Other alternatives, for example, group contribution
model predictions of thermophysical properties, may not reflect experimental
data reliably as the group contribution method is “inherently
approximate”.20 Empirical correlations
available also have parameters that are generally obtained via regression
in a specific range of temperature and pressure conditions, which
may not correspond to the operating conditions of the industrial processes.
Hence, molecular simulations are a promising cost-effective alternative
tool for predicting thermodynamic properties and additionally enable
investigation into the molecular-level behavior of complex organic
compounds18,20−31 such as levulinic acid (which contains both the keto group and the
carboxylic acid group), the molecule of interest here.

In this
study, Monte Carlo simulations have been performed to obtain
thermodynamic properties, including vapor–liquid coexistence
properties, of levulinic acid by employing the transferable potentials
for phase equilibria-united atom (TraPPE-UA) force field in conjunction
with Monte Carlo simulation techniques. Toward achieving this, parameterization
of a dihedral interaction of the TraPPE-UA force field not reported
in the literature has been performed, whereas the other parameters
are assumed to be transferrable from the TraPPE-UA force field for
other organic molecules.18,21,26,28−35 The parameters for the force field used in this study are verified
by comparing the liquid densities determined via standard Metropolis
Monte Carlo simulations with the corresponding experimental data.11 Furthermore, the molecular-level structure of
the liquid has been investigated using the results of the same simulations
to study the associating-type interactions present in this system.
Additionally, we have estimated the vapor–liquid coexistence
properties of this compound in the high-temperature range by employing
the computationally efficient transition-matrix Monte Carlo (TMMC)
simulations in the grand canonical (GC) ensemble. The rest of this
article is organized as follows. The force field employed to model
the interactions present in the levulinic acid system is described
in Section 2, and details
of the molecular simulation runs (performed using the open source
MCCCS Towhee software package37) are reported
in Section 3. Analyses
of the results are discussed in Section 4. Section 5 summarizes the conclusions of this study.

2 Force Field
The first step in any molecular simulation approach
is the selection
of an appropriate force field to describe the nonbonded and bonded
interactions present in the system. In this study, we have adopted
the transferable potentials for phase equilibria-united atom (TraPPE-UA)
force field to model the interactions present in the system of levulinic
acid molecules under consideration. The TraPPE-UA force field has
been developed by the Siepmann group at the University of Minnesota.
This force field, with highly transferable parameters, is known to
predict thermodynamic properties (in particular, vapor–liquid
phase coexistence properties) accurately for a wide range of organic
molecules at different state conditions.36

The nonbonded interactions are modeled as a sum of the van
der
Waals interactions modeled using the 12–6 Lennard-Jones (LJ)
potential, and electrostatic interactions are modeled with the Coulombic
potential (where partial charges are present), as shown in eq 1 1  where rij is the separation distance
between the ith
and jth united atoms, εij is the LJ well depth, σij is the LJ diameter, and qi represents the partial charge on the ith
united atom. A cutoff distance of 14 Å has been employed with
analytical tail corrections being considered beyond the cutoff distance.
Coulombic interactions are computed using the Ewald summation method,
and the parameters used here are as recommended by the MCCCS Towhee
manual.37 The parameters employed to model
levulinic acid are given in Table 1. The unlike interactions are modeled using the Lorentz–Berthelot
combining rules. 2a   2b

The bond angle bending is described
using the harmonic potential
shown in eq 3 below. 3  In eq 3, θ, θeq, and kθ are the bond angle,
equilibrium bond angle, and force
constant, respectively, and are listed in Table 2b.

The torsional interactions are modeled
using eqs 4a or 4b depending on the
four united atoms involved, and the parameters for the dihedral interactions
are reported in Table 2c 4a   4b  Here, ϕ is the dihedral angle
and ci represents the ith coefficient. The parameters (see Table 2c) for the torsion 2–3–5–6
(refer to Figure 1 for
the corresponding united atoms) are not reported in the literature
and have been calculated using the density functional theory (DFT)
approach. This approach has been successfully implemented in the literature
for the determination of the missing torsions in other organic compounds
such as organic cyclic molecules, acrylates, cyclic alkanes, ethers,
etc. To determine the missing torsion parameters, scans of the potential
energy surface have been performed at 5° interval from −180
to 180° at the B3PW91 level of theory with the 6-31++G(d,p) basis
set using Gaussian 03 software.38Figure 2 shows a comparison
of the fitted equation (eq 4a) and the DFT results, and these are observed to be in good
agreement with the exception of the discrepancies observed near the
minima and maxima values, which have been noted in the literature
for other compounds also.22,39

3 Simulation Details
All simulations,
in this study, have been performed using the MCCCS
Towhee version 7.1.0 software package,37 and the transition-matrix Monte Carlo simulation technique employed
for phase equilibria simulations is described in detail in ref (30).

3.1 Isothermal–Isobaric
Ensemble Simulations
Standard Monte Carlo simulations have
been performed in the isothermal–isobaric
ensemble to first compute the liquid densities at a pressure of 100
kPa and a temperature range of 313.15–338.15 K in intervals
of 5 K. These simulations have been performed for purposes of comparison
with experimental data reported in the literature. A system size of N = 300 levulinic acid molecules has been considered. Periodic
boundary conditions (PBCs) have been applied in all three directions
in the cubic simulation box. The trial moves are volume change moves,
aggregation-volume-biased moves, configurational bias regrowth moves,
and rotation and center-of-mass translation moves in the frequency
ratio 10:30:15:15:30. Averages have been computed over 100 000
production cycles, after performing each of the simulations for at
least 250 000 relaxation cycles to attain equilibrium. Comparison
with experimental data has been provided in Section 4. Because levulinic acid contains both the
keto group and the acid group, we have also investigated the structure
of the liquid phases at the conditions specified by calculating the
site–site intermolecular radial distribution functions (RDFs).
The analyses of the results obtained are reported in Section 4.

3.2 Grand
Canonical Ensemble Simulations
We have performed transition-matrix
Monte Carlo (TMMC) simulations
in the grand canonical (GC) ensemble to derive the vapor–liquid
coexistence data, viz., the phase diagram in the temperature–density
plane and Clapeyron plot. The single-box GC-TMMC simulation technique
has been employed to perform the simulation here as it is known to
be computationally more efficient than the traditionally employed
two-box simulation techniques, such as the Gibbs ensemble Monte Carlo
method. This is because information from the rejected Monte Carlo
moves is also used to compute the particle number probability distribution
(PNPD) at any arbitrary value of the chemical potential and the PNPD
at a coexistence value of the chemical potential can be determined
via histogram reweighting. In this study, GC-TMMC simulations have
been performed at arbitrary chemical potentials in a cubic box of
length 50 Å and in a temperature range from 580 to 690 K. Experimental
data for phase coexistence behavior is not available in the literature
at these high temperatures. The particle numbers range from a minimum
value of 0 to a maximum of 950. The frequencies of attempted trials
in these simulations are 40% particle insertions/deletions, 15% aggregation-volume-biased
moves, 10% configuration-biased regrowths, 15% center-of-mass translation
moves, and 20% rotation moves. Again, PBCs have been applied in the x-, y-, and z-directions
in the cubic simulation box. The vapor and liquid coexistence densities
and the saturation pressure at a given temperature have been determined
from the particle number probability distributions obtained at the
end of each simulation run. These coexistence properties are then
fitted to the scaling law and the law of rectilinear diameters to
calculate the critical properties.19,26 The discussion
on the results, thus derived, is given in Section 4.

Acid
The liquid densities obtained from the single-box Metropolis
MC simulations
have been compared with the experimental data at 100 kPa and in the
temperature range 313.15 to 338.15 K (in Table 3). The simulation results are found to be
in good agreement (slight underprediction) with the corresponding
experimental densities with the maximum relative absolute deviation
being less than 4.2%. Based on this, we assume that the parameterization
of the TraPPE-UA force field employed in this study will predict other
thermodynamic properties, including vapor–liquid coexistence
properties, with reasonable accuracy.

4.1.2 Structure of Liquid Levulinic
Acid
As levulinic acid is a ketoacid, the molecular-level
structure of
this liquid is important, and we have examined this by computing the
site–site intermolecular RDFs. Figure 3 shows the RDFs present between the partially
charged pseudoatoms at 313.15 K. The variation of the structure with
temperature has also been investigated, and it was found that the
RDFs at 313.15 K are representative of the structure at the higher
temperatures (318.15–338.15 K) also.

Figure 3 Site–site intermolecular
RDFs in levulinic acid at 313.15
K.

In Figure 3a, we
analyze the presence of hydrogen bonding on the basis of the procedure
followed by Stubbs et al.19 for pure systems
containing diols or glycols, who stated the criterion for hydrogen
bonding to occur as the distance between the closest oxygen and the
given hydroxyl hydrogen in the −OH group to be less than 3.3
Å. We have also considered only the separation distance between
the oxygen and the hydrogen with partial charges present in the system
instead of the more rigorous geometric and/or energetic criteria.
As seen in Figure 3a, the first peak in the RDF of H9–O4 (see Figure 1) occurs at r = 1.89 Å, and this intermolecular distance (r) indicates the existence of hydrogen bond. The height of this peak
reduces from g(r) = 2.1 at 313.15
K to g(r) = 1.722 at 338.15 K, which
is the expected behavior (i.e., the number of hydrogen bonds will
decrease as temperature will increase). Additionally, the RDF for
H9–O7 at 313.15 K in Figure 3a shows a first peak height of g(r) = 3.94 at the same separation distance of r = 1.89 Å. This indicates that the H9–O7 hydrogen bonds
are stronger than those of H9–O4, which can be explained by
the fact that the partial charge on O7 (in the carboxylic acid group)
is −0.45e as compared to −0.424e on O4 (in the keto group). However, although the partial
charge on O8 is −0.46e (which is slightly
higher than that on O7), the RDF of H9–O8 shows a plateau beginning
at r ∼ 2.03 Å (at higher temperatures, r ∼ 2.17 Å) and the highest RDF peak (with a
much shorter peak height g(r) =
1.32) at a separation distance of r = 3.99 Å.
This is possibly because of the positions occupied by the O7 and O8
atoms relative to the position of H9 in the acid group, which results
in more probability of hydrogen bonds being formed with O7 than with
O8 as there is an intramolecular covalent bond existing between O8
and H9.

The presence of partial charges on the C2, C5, and C6
united atoms
results in associating-type interactions with O4, O7, and O8 pseudoatoms.
These weaker attractive interactions are noted in the intermolecular
RDFs illustrated in Figure 3b for C6–O7 (primary peak height g(r) = 1.538 at r = 3.57 Å)
and C6–O8 (primary peak height g(r) = 1.76 at r = 3.85 Å), where C6, O7, and
O8 are all united atoms in the carboxylic acid group, whereas the
RDF for C6–O4 indicates that these atoms scarcely influence
each other. The primary peak in the RDF of C2–O8 shown in Figure 3c occurs at r = 3.99 Å with a peak height of g(r) = 1.336, whereas the C2–O7 and C2–O4
RDFs have lower peak heights, indicating very weak correlations between
the positions of these atoms. In Figure 3d, the RDFs of the CH2 united
atom (site # 5 in Figure 1 and represented as C5 in legend of Figure 3d) with the keto group oxygen atom, O4, and
with the O7 atom in the carboxylic acid group show the appearance
of a plateau at r ∼ 4 Å and the highest
peaks at r ∼ 5 Å, whereas the CH2–O4 RDF shows the first peak at a separation distance
of r = 4.97 Å. However, the highest peak height
of g(r) = 1.438 is observed in the
CH2–O7 RDF with the other first peak heights being
lower than this, indicating a stronger attractive interaction between
CH2 and O7 as compared to that in CH2–O8
and CH2–O7.

Canonical Ensemble Simulations
4.2.1 Vapor–Liquid
Coexistence Properties
We have also attempted to predict
the high-temperature fluid phase
behavior of levulinic acid as the experimental data is limited to
low vapor pressure data in the temperature range of 375–519
K.18 The normal boiling point of levulinic
acid is 518.7 K.18 We note here again the transferability of
the TraPPE-UA parameters reported in the literature to the force field
used to describe the interactions in levulinic acid (with the exception
of one missing dihedral interaction that has been determined in this
study). The vapor–liquid coexistence data for levulinic acid
as obtained from our GC-TMMC simulations are reported in Table 4.

The pure component coexistence densities
for the vapor and liquid
phases in equilibrium are also shown in Figure 4 as a function of temperature. Due to the
unavailability of experimental data in the high-temperature range,
a comparison has not been provided. We, therefore, report the comparison
of the experimental data with simulation results (available in the
literature) of 2-pentanone19 and pentanoic
acid26 as levulinic acid (C3H8O3) is a ketoacid and has been stated previously
the parameters of the force field (describing the interactions in
levulinic acid) have been transferred from these two compounds. The
agreement between TraPPE-UA-based simulation results and experimental
data, reported in the literature for 2-pentanone, is reasonable. For
ketones, the TraPPE-UA force field predicts the coexistence liquid
densities and critical temperatures within 1% relative deviation when
compared with experiments. The parameters of the force field (which
include the >C=O group) were determined from simulations
of
acetone, and these parameters have been used without modification
to estimate the vapor–liquid phase coexistence of 2-pentanone.19 For pentanoic acid, there is excellent agreement
of simulation predictions with experimental liquid phase coexistence
densities (though we note here that experimentally determined saturated
vapor phase density values are not reported in the literature), demonstrating
the transferability of the force-field parameters regressed from acetic
acid properties.26

Figure 4 Vapor–liquid coexistence
curve for levulinic acid in the
temperature–density plane.

From the particle number probability distribution obtained
from
the GC-TMMC simulations, we can directly calculate the vapor pressure,
unlike that in the traditionally employed Gibbs ensemble MC simulations. Figure 5 shows the Clapeyron plot illustrating
the behavior of the vapor pressure (ln Psat) with the inverse temperature (1/T). Again,
comparison with experiment is not provided for levulinic acid in the
temperature range 580–690 K because of the lack of corresponding
experimentally measured values for the saturation pressures. The experimental
results shown are reported in the temperature range 375–519
K,18 and we note that the deviations of
the slope of the simulation predictions from that of the extrapolated
experimental data increase as the temperature increases. However,
for 2-pentanone, the vapor pressures are overpredicted by the TraPPE-UA
force field because, as stated by Stubbs et al.,19 the original parameters employed for the CH3 and CH2 united atoms in the n-alkanes
result in 10% overprediction of the saturation pressures as one of
the limitations of the united atom approach is the tradeoff between
transferability of the parameters and the accuracy of the predictions.
Improvement in agreement may be achieved by following the recommendations
of Stubbs et al.,19 which involve either
using explicit hydrogen representation of the TraPPE family of force
fields or fitting the parameters specifically to experimental results
for 2-pentanone. However, this is beyond the scope of this study and
we have assumed transferability of the relevant parameters. Additionally,
we note that it is also well known that the TraPPE-UA force field
overestimates the vapor pressures of carboxylic acids26 (including pentanoic acid) as compared with experimental
results and that at a temperature of 400 K the saturation pressure
was overpredicted by a factor of 2.6 with the reported relative errors
increasing with decreasing temperatures. This is because, as noted
by Kamath et al.,26 the parameterization
of the TraPPE-UA force field has been developed such that accurate
estimates of the coexistence liquid densities and critical temperature
are obtained, and this in effect fixes the simulated vapor pressures.

Figure 5 Clapeyron plot of the
saturated vapor pressure (Psat) in bars
against inverse temperature for levulinic
acid.

Thus, for levulinic acid, we anticipate
that the predictions for
the coexistence densities in the temperature range of 580–690
K will be reasonably good though the vapor pressures are expected
to be overestimated because of the limitations of the TraPPE-UA force
field. From the simulation data generated in this study, we have determined
the critical temperature, density, and pressure to be 755 K, 285.4
kg/m3, and 30.57 bar, respectively. Because experimental
results for the critical point of levulinic acid are not available,
we have compared our values with the corresponding group contribution
values. From group contribution methods, the critical point values are estimated to be
716.8 K, 350.06 kg/m3, and 39.4 bar.

5 Conclusions
Levulinic acid is a commercially important
organic compound, which
may be derived sustainably from lignocellulosic biomass. The experimental
vapor–liquid equilibrium data for this compound is limited
to a temperature range of 375–519 K18 (normal boiling point), where the vapor pressures are relatively
low. Because experiments in the high-temperature range to determine
the coexistence behavior are challenging for this large oxygen-containing
compound, we have adopted the molecular simulation approach in conjunction
with the TraPPE-UA force field to generate the necessary data at elevated
temperatures and also to investigate the microscopic properties of
this molecule. In this force field, the parameters are assumed to
be transferable from other organic compounds, except for the dihedral
interaction not reported in the literature, and the parameters for
the missing torsion have been determined using the DFT approach in
this study. The parameterization of the force field has been verified
by comparing the liquid densities computed using isothermal–isobaric
ensemble Monte Carlo simulations with the experimental results available
in the literature (where we observed the maximum relative deviation
to be within 5% of literature data). As levulinic acid is a ketoacid,
we have also examined the associating-type interactions present among
the united atoms with partial charges in the liquid phase and have
also analyzed the hydrogen bonding that occurs between the hydroxyl
hydrogen and the three oxygen atoms present in the molecule. We have
then performed GC-TMMC simulations to obtain the PNPD at high temperature
(ranging from 580 to 690 K) from which we have estimated the coexistence
densities of the vapor and liquid phases as well as the vapor pressures.
As there is no experimental data for comparison in the temperature
range studied here, we have reviewed the literature for the accuracy
of the TraPPE-UA force field predictions for 2-pentanone and pentanoic
acid. From these, we anticipate that our computation of the coexistence
densities should be reasonably accurate though the vapor pressures
are expected to be overestimated. The critical point of levulinic
acid (which is not reported in the literature) has also been estimated
from the simulation-generated data as the critical point is an input
to the equation-of-state approach employed in process simulation software
used to design and optimize separation processes.
