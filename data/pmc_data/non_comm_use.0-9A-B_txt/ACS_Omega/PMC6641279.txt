We
report a simple room-temperature synthesis route for increasing
the reactivity of a TiO2 photocatalyst using a solution
plasma process (SPP). Hydrogen radicals generated from the SPP chamber
interact with the TiO2 photocatalyst feedstock, transforming
its crystalline phase and introducing oxygen vacancy defects. In this
work, we examined a pure anatase TiO2 as a model feedstock
because of its photocatalytic attributes and well-characterized properties.
After the SPP treatment, the pure anatase crystalline phase was transformed
to an anatase/brookite heterocrystalline phase with oxygen vacancies.
Furthermore, the SPP treatment promoted the absorption of both UV
and visible light by TiO2. As a result, TiO2 treated by the SPP for 3 h showed a high gaseous photocatalytic
performance (91.1%) for acetaldehyde degradation to CO2 compared with the activity of untreated TiO2 (51%). The
SPP-treated TiO2 was also more active than nitrogen-doped
TiO2 driven by visible light (66%). The overall photocatalytic
performance was related to the SPP treatment time. The SPP technique
could be used to enhance the activity of readily available feedstocks
with a short processing time. These results demonstrate the potential
of this method for modifying narrow-band gap metal oxides, metal sulfides,
and polymer composite-based catalyst materials. The modifications
of these materials are not limited to photocatalysts and could be
used in a wide range of energy and environment-based applications.

Introduction
In recent years, TiO2 has attracted interest owing to
its promising photocatalytic functionality, which has a variety of
applications, including energy conversion,1,2 environmental
remediation,3,4 photochemical storage,5 self-cleaning,6 biomedical
diagnosis7 and therapy,8 and photocatalytic wall coating.9 However, the wide band gap energy of TiO2 (∼3–3.2
eV) limits harvesting of solar energy in the visible wavelength region.10 Therefore, much research has focused on improving
the visible light-harvesting capabilities of TiO2 for outdoor
photocatalytic applications. A recent strategy based on band gap engineering
of the TiO2 lattice through metal and nonmetal doping has
been shown to effectively improve the light harvesting of TiO2.11−16 However, dopant-induced defects in the TiO2 lattices
often have detrimental effects, introducing charge carrier trapping
and recombination sites, which negatively affect the photoactivity.17 Therefore, promoting the photocatalytic activity
of the TiO2 crystal lattice without producing any adverse
effects remains challenging.

Recently, hydrogenated or defect-induced
“black TiO2” (H-TiO2–x) has
shown effective photon harvesting at longer wavelengths up to ∼800
nm with appreciable photocatalytic activity.18,19 The surface disorder (band edge tail) and oxygen vacancies (Vo) formed by the hydrogen treatment can increase the electronic
charge carriers to improve the electronic conductivity and modify
the band gap of TiO2. These effects increase the ability
of TiO2 to absorb visible light. Many techniques have been
applied to synthesize H-TiO2–x,
including high-pressure thermal treatment techniques, chemical oxidation
and reduction methods, high-energy particle bombardment (hydrogen
plasma, argon, and electron), and electrochemical techniques.20−22 Among these techniques, it is believed that hydrogen dopants form
Ti–H and O–H bonds with TiO2. These defects
introduce mid-gap states, which change the color of pristine TiO2 from white to blue, green, or black. Although these methods
are capable of synthesizing H-TiO2–x, the requirements of high processing temperatures (∼500 °C),
vacuum conditions, lengthy process durations, and complex multistep
processes limit their practical implementation.

To address these
limitations, room-temperature solution plasma
process (SPP) techniques might offer a promising alternative to vacuum
techniques.23 SPP is a nonthermal physical
tool for synthesizing metal nanoparticles, metal oxide nanoparticles,
and polymer-passivated metal oxides.24−27 In SPP techniques, plasma generated
inside a liquid (water) acts as a source for generating highly reactive
species, including radicals, atoms, and ions owing to the low dissociation
energy of water. The generation of hydroxyl radicals from an SPP can
drive oxidation processes at a higher oxidation potential than that
possible with other oxidative species. Conversely, hydrogen atoms
from oxidative species are highly energetic and can rapidly diffuse
into the target TiO2 material to produce hydrogenated TiO2. To date, the SPP technique has been applied to in situ synthesis
of H-TiO2–x with titanium (Ti)
rods for anode and cathode.28 During plasma
generation in the liquid, hot spots are created on the oxidized Ti
electrode surface owing to the Joule heating effect, which induces
the pair of metallic Ti electrodes to react, producing H-TiO2–x.28 Using a similar technique,
Yonezawa and co-workers29 synthesized tungsten
(W)-doped black TiO2. The SPP technique has processing
advantages for the synthesis of defect-induced TiO2; however,
the output quantity is not high compared with those of vacuum techniques
because vacuum techniques use presynthesized TiO2 powder
as a feedstock for synthesizing defect-induced TiO2. Thus,
if SPP-based processing could use presynthesized TiO2 as
a feedstock and high outputs could be achieved, it would become a
suitable method for applications on an industrial scale.

In
this work, for the first time, we used SPP to produce TiO2–x on a gram scale, from commercially
available TiO2 solid (ST-1 TiO2, Ishihara Sangyo
Kaisha Ltd., Japan) as a feedstock. This ST-1 TiO2 powder
features a pure anatase phase. A schematic illustration of the SPP
technique is depicted in Scheme 1. In this setup, plasma emission is generated by a
pair of tungsten arc electrodes. The emission center of the plasma
is located in a gas phase, surrounded by an aqueous liquid phase.
This results in two interfaces, namely, plasma/gas and gas/liquid.
Furthermore, an ion sheath forms near the gas/liquid interface, and
the resultant plasma is confined by a condensed phase, which produces
the unique features of a solution plasma.28 This solution plasma drives extremely rapid reactions through activated
chemical species and radicals (hydrogen, hydroxyl, and oxygen) under
a high pressure. Among these active chemical species, the hydrogen
radical (H+*) is mainly responsible for modifying feedstock
particles dispersed in the electrolyte. Nitrogen gas is applied to
the reaction chamber through the central cavity of the cathode electrode,
which energetically produces bubbles in the solution plasma and facilitates
the interaction between the feedstock particles and the hydrogen free-radical
species. A video of the interaction between the nitrogen bubbles and
the plasma was recorded with a high-speed camera (Movie S1, Supporting Information). Further experimental
details of the SPP technique and its parameters are given in the Supporting Information.

Gas Is Applied through the Cathode Cavity)
Results and Discussion
Structural Analysis
The color of
the ST-1 TiO2 powder turned from milky white to light brown
(Figure S1, Supporting Information) after
the SPP treatment.
This color change indicated the modification of the pure anatase ST-1
TiO2 by either induction of defects or reduction of TiO2. However, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of untreated
and SPP-treated ST-1 TiO2 powder showed no notable changes
(Figure S2, Supporting Information). We
analyzed the morphology of the SPP-treated ST-1 TiO2 sample
using high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) imaging in a scanning
transmission electron microscope. Figure 1a–k shows the HAADF–scanning
transmission electron microscopy (STEM) results of the SPP-treated
ST-1 TiO2. In Figure 1a, lattice fringes at two different places indicated
in yellow and red boxes were examined in detail (Figure S3, Supporting Information). The red color indicates
a lattice plane distance of 0.19 nm (Figure 1b) with an interplanar angle of 90°,
corresponding to the anatase (100) plane. The yellow-highlighted lattice
(Figure 1c) shows a
plane distance of 0.34 nm, indicating the anatase (101) plane. The
crystalline lattice was analyzed at random locations, which consistently
showed the presence of (100) and (101) anatase phases. Further investigations
of the influence of the SPP treatment on the bulk TiO2 crystals
(Figure 1d,g) showed
0.45 ± 0.025 nm and 0.35 ± 0.025 nm lattice distances (Figure 1e,h). The corresponding
fast Fourier transform images in Figure 1f,i confirmed that these lattice patterns
derived from brookite (100) and (010) crystalline phases, respectively
(Figure S4, Supporting Information). A
small discrepancy in the brookite lattice distance value exists because
of the different measurements using simulation software and the scale
bar in TEM images. The presence of a heterocrystalline phase of anatase/brookite
was unexpected from this room-temperature process; brookite is usually
formed at a high temperature (160–500 °C).30−33

X-ray spectroscopy results obtained from (a) (Ti and O).

Saito and co-workers demonstrated that H+ radicals generated
from a similar type of SPP reaction, which played a crucial role in
reducing gold precursor salt into gold nanoparticles.34,35 Analogous to the gold nanoparticle formation by the SPP treatment,
it is anticipated that H+ radical species transform anatase
feedstock crystals to a heterocrystalline phase (anatase/brookite).
Surprisingly, Figure 1j shows that the SPP treatment created a thin amorphous, disordered
shell around the TiO2 particles with a thickness of approximately
1–2 nm (for the comparison of the STEM images of untreated
and SPP-treated ST-1 TiO2, see Figure S5, Supporting Information). This disordered amorphous layer was
likely formed by hydrogen radicals in the SPP. As outlined in Scheme 1, during the water
plasma generation, the tungsten electrodes generated positive H+ ions and negative OH– and O2– ions.36 Because the
ionic masses of the negative species are larger than those of the
positive H+ ions, the heavier species remained in the plasma
zone. However, the positive H+ ions rapidly came into contact
with the plasma/liquid interface. In this region, the circulated feedstock,
ST-1 TiO2, interacted with the H+ species. Bombardment
of the TiO2 surface by H+ removed the oxygen
atoms and created oxygen vacancies (Vo) in the TiO2. Thus, a thin amorphous defect layer forms on the particle
surface. In addition, the energetic H+ radical species
reacted with the TiO2 lattice and rearranged the atomic
alignment. This process induces a mixture of anatase (101) and (001)
as well as brookite (100) and (010) crystalline facets.

The
chemical composition and chemical binding environment of the
untreated and SPP-treated ST-1 TiO2 were examined by X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Figure 2a shows the Ti 2p core XPS results of pristine
and SPP-treated TiO2. Two major peaks were observed at
458.6 and 464.4 eV, corresponding to Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2, respectively.37 There was no
major change in the Ti 2p position before and after the SPP treatment.
Furthermore, no traces of Ti3+ could be seen in these spectra.
Although we observed an amorphous TiO2–x layer on the SPP-treated particles (Figure 1j), the XPS results showed no Ti3+ peak (Figure 2a).
Thus, the SPP treatment did not produce Ti3+ centers, and
the observed amorphous shell layer derived from oxygen vacancies.
To confirm the structure, we examined the O 1s spectrum (Figure 2b) of the SPP-treated
TiO2. In Figure 2b, a notable difference in the peak position of the shoulder
at ∼532.4 eV was observed after the SPP treatment. In general,
oxygen atoms in a TiO2 lattice exhibit three possible chemical
states, namely, lattice oxygen OL at 530.7 eV, surface
hydroxyl oxygen at 532.5 eV, and surface-adsorbed oxygen (Ti–OH)
at 533.6 eV.38,39 From Gaussian fitting analysis,
the additional peak observed at 533.4 eV indicated the adsorption
of hydroxyl groups on the TiO2 surface. As discussed earlier,
the removal of oxygen atoms from the outer surface by H+ radical species led to the adsorption of hydroxyl groups from the
atmosphere.39 Atmospheric oxygen species
are not able to intercalate into a fully oxidized TiO2 surface.40 When oxygen vacancies were created on the TiO2 surface, oxygen adatoms attach to these sites and form hydroxyl
groups through O2*– radicals.40 Therefore, the observed hydroxyl oxygen species
peak from the SPP-treated ST-1 sample implies that the SPP treatment
created oxygen vacancies on the TiO2 surface. This result
also explains the amorphous layer found in the STEM results (Figure 1j).

and SPP-treated ST-1 TiO2: (a) Ti 2p and (b) O 1s core
spectra.

Optical Analysis
Analysis of optical absorbance can
provide qualitative information on the TiO2 band gap energy
structure before and after the SPP treatment. Figure 3 shows the optical absorbance results (Kubelka–Munk)
of the untreated and SPP-treated ST-01 TiO2 (indicated
as “a”). To understand the optical properties of the
defect-induced ST-1 TiO2 (indicated as “b”),
we compared these spectra with those of nitrogen-doped TiO2 commercial powder (TiO2–xNx) in Figure 3 (indicated as “c”). These results indicate
that the SPP treatment markedly enhanced the optical absorbance in
the visible wavelength region (400–800 nm); however, there
was no noticeable shift in the characteristic band edge position,
as for TiO2–xNx. This raises questions about the origin of the visible light
absorption of the SPP-treated ST-1 TiO2 sample. We explain
this behavior based on the standard visible light-driven nitrogen-doped
TiO2 system (dotted line in Figure 3). In general, nitrogen anion doping introduces
charge carriers into TiO2 and creates mid band gap states
above the valence band (i.e., band gap splitting), which are responsible
for the visible light absorption of TiO2–xNx.10 Compared with the absorption features of TiO2–xNx in Figure 3, the SPP-treated ST-1 TiO2 did not show any shift of the optical band edge but instead
featured enhanced absorbance in the tail part of the visible light
region. According to the literature, the ionization energy of oxygen
vacancies in reduced TiO2 lies between ∼0.75 and
1.18 eV.13,41,42 From this
value, we can assume that oxygen vacancies are located below the conduction
band as surface states. A few other researchers have reported a similar
optical behavior of bicrystalline phase and oxygen vacancies introduced
into TiO2.22,31,33,43 The creation of oxygen vacancies (Vo) by the SPP treatment was verified with electron spin resonance
(ESR) measurements (Figure S6, Supporting Information). From Figure S6, additional peaks were
found at g = 2.003 in the ESR spectra of 3 and 8
h SPP-treated ST-1 TiO2. These results confirmed that oxygen
vacancies were generated by the SPP treatment.44 Furthermore, no major peaks were observed for Ti3+ at g = 1.975.45 Therefore,
the ESR results support the premise that the optical absorbance enhancement
of ST-1 TiO2 could be attributed to oxygen vacancy defects
rather than Ti3+. XPS analysis also showed that the SPP-treated
ST-1 TiO2 contained no Ti3+ centers.

ST-1 TiO2 feedstock powders (the dotted line represents
the untreated nitrogen-doped TiO2 powder).

On the other hand, the light absorbance enhancement
in the tail
region (400–800 nm) in ST-1 TiO2 may also be influenced
by brookite/anatase heterostructure formation. In the heterocrystalline
structure, that is, brookite/anatase (B/A) or anatase/rutile (A/R),
the absorbance edge shift relies on the fraction of the composite
ratio (B/A). Zhao et al.31 reported that
brookite phase quantity mainly influences the optical absorbance feature
of the B/A composite. For instance, for the brookite phase, until
it reaches the optimum fraction (B50/A50), the
quantity of light absorbance is monotonically increased in the visible
light region (>400 nm). While the brookite quantity exceeds the
optimum
ratio, the optical absorbance edge will be shifted. In the present
work, the SPP treatment promotes the optical absorbance quantity in
the visible light wavelength region rather than band edge shift. This
implies that brookite phase formation during SPP treatment could be
mild and lesser than the optimum ratio (B50/A50). Therefore, we conclude that the energetic structure of the SPP-treated
ST-1 TiO2 is different from that of black TiO2.

Photocatalytic Activity
The photocatalytic activities
of the untreated and SPP-treated ST-1 TiO2 solid were evaluated
for the degradation of gaseous acetaldehyde.46 First, we investigated the influence of the SPP treatment duration
time (3, 8, and 15 h) on the photocatalytic activity of ST-1 TiO2. Figure 4 shows
the typical plots of the decrease in the concentration of acetaldehyde
and the increase in the concentration of CO2 products as
a function of reaction time. During the equilibrium process (in the
dark), a slight decrease of the acetaldehyde concentration for the
untreated ST-1 TiO2 sample (dotted line in Figure 4) without an accompanying increase
in CO2 concentration was attributed to the gas adsorption
on the TiO2 surface. The solid line plots in Figure 4 indicate that the acetaldehyde
concentration decreased as CO2 formed when the solids were
irradiated by a fluorescence lamp (8000 lux intensity). Note the 1:2
stoichiometric ratio between acetaldehyde and CO2. From Figure 4, the untreated ST-1
TiO2 showed a very weak photocatalytic activity for acetaldehyde
molecules and only 50.9% CO2 conversion. Under identical
experimental conditions, the 8 h SPP-treated ST-1 TiO2 showed
a high photocatalytic activity, with 96.6% of the initial acetaldehyde
completely converted to CO2. The 15 h-treated ST-1 TiO2 sample resulted in a lower photoactivity (80.7%) than that
of the 3 h (91.1%)-treated samples owing to a reduction of the surface
area during the SPP treatment (Figure S7, Supporting Information). The difference of the photocatalytic performance
between 3 and 8 h samples is found to be ∼5%. This implies
that 3 h of SPP treatment is sufficient to achieve effective photocatalytic
degradation compared to the untreated sample.

Figure 4 Plots of decreasing acetaldehyde
concentration for the untreated
and SPP-treated ST-1 TiO2 samples vs time. The dashed and
solid lines represent the acetaldehyde and CO2 concentrations,
respectively.

We investigated the feasibility
of using this SPP technique to
treat other commercial TiO2 feedstock powders. We examined
the properties of TiO2 after the SPP treatment, for P25-TiO2 and MT-150A TiO2. P25 TiO2 featured
a mixture of anatase and rutile phases, and MT-150A-TiO2 consists of a pure rutile phase. The photocatalytic results of the
untreated and SPP-treated samples for the degradation of acetaldehyde
to CO2 are presented in Figure 5. This bar chart indicates that the SPP treatment
markedly enhanced the photocatalytic performance of all samples. However,
the 3 h SPP-treated ST-1 TiO2 showed the highest photocatalytic
performance among all SPP-treated TiO2 feedstock samples.
On the basis of these results, the photocatalytic performance of the
TiO2 could be ordered as ST-1 > P25 > N-TiO2–x > MT-150A. The SPP-treated P25 and MT-150A TiO2 both showed a high visible light activity (Figure S8, Supporting Information); however, their photocatalytic
activities were lower than that of ST-1 TiO2. Similarly,
the untreated nitrogen-doped TiO2 (N-TiO2) also
possessed a high visible light activity at 420 nm but had low photocatalytic
performance.

photocatalytic acetaldehyde degradation experiments using different
photocatalyst samples.

A possible mechanism for the photocatalytic degradation of
the
gaseous acetaldehyde by the SPP-treated ST-1 TiO2 is shown
in Scheme 2 and can
be explained as follows. Under light irradiation, photogenerated electrons
(e–) and holes (h+) are, respectively,
induced in the conduction and valence bands of ST-1 TiO2. These charge carriers drive the photocatalytic degradation of the
gaseous acetaldehyde reaction in a multistep transformation. Various
potential pathways for photocatalytic degradation by TiO2 have been proposed, including hole-generated hydroxyl radicals,
carbonyl radicals, superoxide radicals, and hydrogen peroxide.47,48 A typical reaction scheme is described as follows:49 (i) photogenerated holes mediate the reaction: 1  and (ii) photoelectrons
mediate the reaction: 2   3  

Scheme 2 Proposed Mechanism of Photocatalytic Degradation of Acetaldehyde
by the SPP-Treated ST-1 TiO2
The carbonyl radicals (CH3CO•) formed
in eq 1 can react with
O2, which mediates the chain reactions of acetaldehyde
oxidation. In these multiple reactions, acetic acid is the main intermediate
in the transformation to CO2, by the reaction CH3COOH + •OH → CO2 + H2O + CH3•.

We confirmed that the SPP treatment
produced oxygen vacancies and
surface defects below the conduction band. These defects led to the
formation of more reactive sites and attracted atmospheric oxygen
species, which were converted to O2* radicals through reactions with photoelectrons
(eq 2). These oxygen
radicals are a key intermediate driving the acetaldehyde degradation
reactions in the SPP-treated TiO2 samples. Therefore, we
conclude that the high gaseous photocatalytic performance shown by
the SPP-treated ST-1 TiO2 can be attributed to the following
reasons: (a) a greater number of reactive sites through the formation
of surface defects (b) more effective charge separation at anatase/brookite
heterocrystalline phases; and (c) enhanced hydrophilicity of the surface
(Ti–OH formation). To determine the effects of the light wavelength
on the 3 h SPP-treated ST-1 TiO2, we examined the photocatalytic
activity at different light irradiation wavelengths (Figure S9, Supporting Information). We found that the photocatalytic
activity was highest in the UV region (<420 nm) and no activity
occurred in the visible region (>420 nm). Although the sample showed
considerable absorption of visible light, attributed to oxygen vacancy
surface states, the photocatalytic activity was driven by excitation
in the UV light region. These results suggest that the crystalline
phases (anatase/brookite) and lattice arrangement (defects) induced
by the SPP treatment were responsible for the enhanced activity rather
than the increased visible light absorption. Though significant visible
light absorbance was observed in SPP-treated TiO2 (Figures 3 and S8), it does not show a gas-phase photocatalytic
activity at 400 nm. This discrepancy may be due to the fact that the
quantity of light absorbance in the visible light wavelength region
(400–800 nm) is still not sufficient compared to black TiO2 to drive the gas-phase photocatalysis reaction using only
visible light photons.50

Conclusions
We used a room-temperature SPP technique to produce a heterocrystalline
anatase/brookite TiO2 solid, containing oxygen vacancies,
on a large scale. This process has advantages in terms of its room-temperature
processing, potential for scale-up, and relatively short processing
time compared with conventional vacuum-based high-temperature approaches.
Thus, we show that the SPP is an effective modern tool for material
modification, which avoids the risks of handling gas-phase hydrogen
species in high-temperature plasma treatments. However, further investigations
are required to examine the underlying mechanism of the TiO2 lattice rearrangement induced by the SPP treatment from both theoretical
and experimental approaches (e.g., X-ray absorption techniques). Further
studies of the SPP parameters, such as different feedstocks, cathode
materials, and interdependence of SPP treatment duration and crystalline
phase ratio, will be conducted in the future to optimize the photocatalytic
performance. The SPP technique enables a wide range of feedstock powders
to be used as starting materials. Hence, the SPP technique is shown
to be a simple tool with the potential for low-cost modification of
a wide range of metal oxides and possibly other materials such as
narrow-band gap metal sulfides, carbonaceous materials, and polymer
materials.

Experimental Section
Solution Plasma Processing
We adopt
the SPP technique
reported elsewhere51 and demonstrate with
a major modification. Primarily, the plasma was generated in deionized
water using a pulsed dc power supply (Kurita Co. Ltd; MPP-HV04). Tungsten
(W) tubes (outer diameter: 3 mm and inner diameter: 1 mm) were used
as electrodes with an interelectrode gap of 0.3 mm. To expose the
plasma only on the tip of the tungsten electrode, the remaining part
of the electrode was covered with a ceramic insulator tube. Nitrogen
gas (flow rate: 200 mL min–1) was applied through
the cavity (0.1 mm) of the tungsten cathode. The applied voltage,
pulse frequency, and pulse width were optimized for effective plasma
generation and are as follows: V = 2 kV, F = 20 kHz, and t = 1 μs, respectively.
The plasma was generated for different time durations (3, 8, and 15
h) based on the requirement. The schematic illustration of the SPP
apparatus setup is given in Scheme 1. The feedstock TiO2 powder was continuously
circulated through a motor.

Characterization
The crystal structures
of the untreated
and SPP-treated samples were examined using an X-ray diffractometer
(Rigaku Ultima IV). The crystalline morphology and lattice were analyzed
using a HAADF–scanning transmission electron microscope (HF-2210,
Hitachi, Ltd. Japan). The chemical environment of pristine and SPP-treated
samples was analyzed using XPS with a monochromated Al Kα source
(AXIS Nova, Kratos Analytical). The optical absorbance of the samples
were recorded using the diffuse reflectance spectra of the electrodes
in the range of 350–800 nm using a V-670 JASCO UV–vis
spectrophotometer. The absorbance of the untreated and SPP-treated
TiO2 samples was obtained through the Kubelka–Munk
relationship with in-built software from the JASCO UV–vis spectrometer.
The ESR spectra of the untreated and SPP-treated sample were recorded
with an ESP350E (Bruker Co.) at 20 K under the following conditions:
central magnetic field, 3386 G; magnetic field sweep width, 200 G;
and microwave frequency and power: 9.48 GHz and 4 μW, respectively.
The surface areas of the untreated and SPP-treated samples were evaluated
by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller technique using a BELSORP-max
instrument.

Photocatalytic Experiments
The photocatalytic
activity
was evaluated by degradation of gaseous acetaldehyde in a batch-type
reactor. The Pyrex glass-based vessel (500 mL volume) was used for
the experiment, and its top was covered with a quartz plate. An equal
amount of TiO2 samples was used for all photocatalytic
experiments. For instance, 0.1 g of TiO2 powder sample
mixed with 0.2 mL of deionized water was spread on the glass substrate
and dried at 60 °C. Further, this sample was kept at the bottom
of the glass vessel as explained above. Before starting the degradation
experiments, the vessel was filled with commercially available pure
air (Taiyo Nippon Sanso Corp.) with a humidity of about 50% by flowing
through a water mixture. Followed that, the samples were illuminated
in air using UV light (1.2 mW cm2) for 24 h to remove the
unwanted organic pollutants on the surface. Then, a measured amount
of gaseous acetaldehyde (1 vol % acetaldehyde in N2, Takachiho)
was injected into the reactor with a Pressure-Lok syringe as the target
pollutant. The system was kept in the dark for 1 h for adsorption
equilibration and then was irradiated with a fluorescent lamp (8000
lux). The decrease in the acetaldehyde concentration and the increase
in the CO2 product concentration were monitored using gas
chromatography with nitrogen as a carrier (GC-2014, Shimadzu, equipped
with a 2 m Porapak-Q column and a flame ionization detector). Three
batches of the untreated and SPP-treated TiO2 samples were
tested, and the average values are presented.
