Aedes aegypti is a mosquito vector
that spreads dengue fever and yellow fever worldwide in tropical and
subtropical countries. Essential oil isolated from Artemisia vulgaris is found to have larvicidal and
repellent action against this vector. The dried leaves were subjected
to hydrodistillation using a clevenger-type apparatus for 4 h. The
isolated essential oil was analyzed by using gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry, and the major insecticidal compounds were identified
as α-humulene (0.72%), β-caryophyllene (0.81%), and caryophyllene
oxide (15.87%). Larvicidal activity results revealed that the essential
oil exposure for 24 h period against the third stage larvae was LC50 = 6.87, LC90 = 59.197 ppm and for the fourth
stage larvae LC50 = 4.269, LC90 = 50.363 ppm.
Highest mortality rates were observed at 24 h exposure period of third
and fourth stages, and the exposed A. aegypti larvae were subjected to histo chemical studies, and the studies
revealed that larvae cells got totally damaged (midgut and cortex).
The repellent activity results revealed that at 50% concentration
of the essential oil showed the highest repellent activity at 60 min
protection time against the A. aegypti female mosquitoes. To gain further insights into the insecticidal
activity, density functional theory and molecular docking calculations
were performed with the active components of this essential oil as
the ligand and NS3 protease domain (PDB ID: 2FOM) as a receptor.
Molecular docking calculation results show that (E)-β-caryophyllene strongly binds with NS3 protease domain than
(Z)-β-caryophyllene, α-humulene, and
β-caryophyllene oxide and is the major active component for
the insecticidal action. It primarily interacts with the receptor
through hydrophobic and ionic forces and using water bridges between
the amino acid residues in the binding pocket and (E)-β-caryophyllene.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Dengue fever is one of the most dangerous fevers threatening mankind
in the recent past. Especially in the developing countries, India
is the main victim of this disease. It is reported that the Philippines
with more than 169 000 cases and Malaysia with around 111 000 suspects
contribute a huge population to the total dengue cases, and furthermore,
Brazil alone reported having over 1.5 million cases of dengue.1 Dengue virus belongs to the family Flaviviridae.2,3 Humans and monkeys are greatly affected by this dengue virus. Dengue
fever shows symptoms in patients such as increased body fever up to
40 °C, muscle and joint pain, severe headache, facial flushing
and skin rashes, and severe flu-like symptoms.4 The fever symptoms will not appear immediately; it will start appearing
after 5 to 8 days of the infection in patients.5 This shows that the urgent need for treating this deadly
disease. Many researchers have been toiling day and night to come
up with suitable drug and medicine to treat dengue fever and to control
the vector. The huge concern on public health and the limited options
available in the treatment of dengue diseases have stimulated efforts
to identify and characterize potential viral drug target.

One
such strategy is using the medicinal plant as a source to find
new medicines. In the literature, it is reported that the essential
oils from plants have been used to treat various diseases. For instance, Mentha, Melissa, and Salvia plants have piperitenone oxide, which kills Culex pipiens larvae responsible for Japanese encephalitis.6 Terpenoid compounds obtained from Pogostemon species were found to show greater larvicidal
activity against Aedes albopictus larvae.7 This indicates that essential oil from plants
is important in drug designing. Essential oils are complex mixtures
comprising of many single compounds, and chemically, they are derived
from terpenes and their oxygenated compounds. However, more number
of synthetic organic insecticides (organophosphates) have been used
for controlling populations of Aedes aegypti. More number of synthetic organic insecticides (organophosphates)
have been used for controlling populations of A. aegypti. These types of insecticides are toxic to human beings and environment.
Thus, this raises concern to urgently look for alternative technology
for vector control management.8,9

According to this
study, it has been reported that the dengue virus
vector genome is 10.7–11 kb length, and virus genome is composed
of single-stranded RNA. The structure of the dengue virus is generally
spherical with a diameter of approximately 50 nm,10 which is proteolytically cleaved into 10 viral proteins,
including three structural and seven nonstructural (NS) proteins.
The order of these viral proteins is capsid, pre-membrane, envelope
protein, NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5. The structural
proteins are responsible for the structure of a virus and NS proteins
are necessary for the viral replication.11 NS3 is composed of a protease (NS3PRO) and a helicase (NS3HEL) domain,
and the former is responsible for processing the polyprotein in specific
sites.12 Thus, NS3 compound is considered
as a significant target to screen and evaluate effects of different
drug candidates.13 Therefore, docking studies
with NS3 protease protein and the active component of the oil were
performed to understand the biological activity.

The X-ray structure
of the NS3 isoforms forms the DV-3 stereotype
complexes with a serine protease inhibitor and its X-ray structure
has been recently deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB code 3U1I).14−16 NS3 is a NS
protein of 69 kDa and it is a multifunctional protein. It has two
domains, namely N-terminal domain and C-terminal domain. The N-terminal
domain is a serine protease with NS2B cofactor which is important
for viral poly protein processing. The C-terminal domain is RNA helicase
and a nucleoside 5* triphosphate, and this domain is involving in
the viral replication and virus particle assembly. This clearly reveals
the important role of NS3 in the viral life cycle and indicates that
it is the suitable target for the development of DV inhibitors.17 Molecular docking with small molecular inhibitors
was done and the docking results were used in molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations. Homology model was used for virtual screening, searching
pharmacophore, and docking small molecule inhibitors from databases.
The obtained results from MD simulations give a clear understanding
of the ligand receptor interaction at a molecular level, and furthermore,
they provide useful clues for the development of drugs to treat DV
infections.18,19 The homology model for the DENV
NS2B/NS3 protease was done first by Brinkworth and co-workers.20

The present work focuses on the extraction
of the essential oil
from Artemisia vulgaris and investigates
its biological activity. It is important to note that A. vulgaris is a medicinal, aromatic plant and belongs
to the family of Asteraceae and species of A. vulgaris.21 These plants are more common in Europe,
Asia, Northern Africa, and Alaska and are naturalized in North America.22 Over the years, the essential oil obtained from A. vulgaris has been used by food and pharmaceutical
industries and in folk medicine to treat gastrointestinal diseases.
This essential oil contains many volatile compounds and its components
are known for insecticidal properties and allelopathic effect. Moreover,
the dried leaves and boiled leaves are showing greater medicinal values.
It is also reported that this plant has been used in the treatment
of various diseases, including anthelmintic, antiseptic, antispasmodic,
carminative, cholagogue, diaphoretic, digestive, emmenagogue, expectorant,
nervine, purgative, stimulant, and slightly tonic.23−25 This has triggered
our interest toward A. vulgaris plant
and its essential oil toward the treatment of dengue fever vector.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Isolation of the Essential
Oil
The
essential oil was isolated from the leaves of A. vulgaris at a yield of 0.5% (v/w). The essential oil was analyzed to find
out the major constituents through gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis. This analysis shows the 63 compounds
were present in the oil (Figure 1). It is important to note that the A. vulgaris essential oil contains the following
important insecticidal terpenoid compounds; camphor (26.99%), α-humulene
(0.72%), β-caryophyllene (0.81%), and β-caryophyllene
oxide (15.87%), respectively (Table 1). Similar compounds were reported for the Cinnamomum zeylanicum bark, which contains α-humulene
(0.28%) and β-caryophyllene (0.89%) respectively.26 Similarly, essential oil of various species
of Guarea contains caryophyllene epoxide
(40.91%) and humulene epoxide II (14.43%). Essential oil of Guarea humaitensis has cis-caryophyllene
(33.37%) and α-trans bergamotene (11.88%), respectively. Meanwhile, Gentiana scabra essential oil consists of caryophyllene
epoxide (36.54%) and spathulenol (14.34%), respectively.27 The earlier study suggests that hairy root culture
essential oil from A. vulgaris contains
camphene (5.5%), camphor (20.8%), α-thujone (12.3%), and β-caryophyllene
(5.7%), respectively.28 This indicates
that the obtained volatile compounds are in total agreement with the
earlier reports.

2.2 Bioassay of Larvicidal Activity
The
essential oil isolated from A. vulgaris leaf explant exhibits significant larvicidal activity at various
concentrations (5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 ppm) against the dengue fever
vector A. aegypti (Tables 2 and 3). In the present study, two types of the larvae are considered.
It is interesting to note that 12 h exposure of the essential oil
to third stage larvae leads to the highest mortality at 100 ppm (62.00
± 2.8), LC50 values = 38.3 ppm, LC90 =
1270 ppm. On the other hand, 24 h exposure of the essential oil leads
to third stage larvae produces the highest mortality at 100 ppm (97.28
± 0.7), LC50 values = 6.87 ppm, LC90 =
59.197. In the fourth stage larvae, highest mortality is observed
at 100 ppm (74.00 ± 1.0), LC50 values = 135.238 ppm,
LC90 = 1.007 ppm for 12 h exposure. Upon 24 h exposure,
the highest mortality is observed at 100 ppm (98.81 ± 0.4), LC50 values = 4.269 ppm, LC90 = 50.363 ppm (Tables 2 and 3). The compounds identified in A. vulgaris leaf essential oil such as β-caryophyllene, α-humulene,
and β-caryophyllene oxide have a huge impact on the larvicidal
activity. It is also important to note that these compounds of essential
oil interact with the cells of A. aegypti larvae and destroy them completely resulting in the death of cells.
The results of the present study can be compared with earlier reports,29−31 where leaf essential oil of Eucalyptus camaldulensis had a very excellent activity against A. aegypti larvae and A. albopictus larvae12
and 24 exposure h with LC50 values of 71.8 and 192.4 μg/mL
and LC50 values of 31.0 and 55.3 μg/mL, respectively.
The activity of Cryptomeria japonica leaf essential oil against the fourth stage of A.
aegypti larvae with 24 h exposure time showed LC50 = 37.6 μg/mL, LC90 = 71.9 μg/mL. Zanthoxylum armatum seed essential oil is found to
show greater activity against third stage mosquito larvae such as Culex quinquefasciatus with LC50 = 49
ppm, followed by A. aegypti LC50 = 54 ppm and Anopheles stephensi LC50 = 58 ppm. The above data revealed that A. vulgaris leaf essential oil exhibits high mortality
rate against A. aegypti larvae compared
to earlier reports.

The
dead larvae have been used for histological studies. Histological
images obtained for 24 h treated larvae are given in Figure 2. The figure shows the cortex
(ct), midgut (mg), and determine tissue (dt) regions of the A. aegypti larvae with and without treatments. Figure 2a,c shows that the
third and fourth stages of control larvae in which the ct, mg, and
dt regions are intact, whereas in Figure 2b,d, the image of the treated larvae shows
that ct, mg, and dt regions were highly affected, and there also both
third and fourth stage larvae were observed to have leakage of the
mg region contents. This may be due to the presence of volatile compounds
such as α-humulene, β-caryophyllene, and β-caryophyllene
oxide in the essential oil. Literature reports suggest that compared
to purified compounds, crude extracts or plant extracts are less expensive
and highly effective for the control of mosquitoes.32,33

that NS3 is a multifunctional protein composed of a helicase and a

processed by the viral NS2B/NS3 protease.

2.3 Repellent Activity
Table 4 presents data pertaining to
the repellent activity of the essential oil at various concentrations
(2.5, 5, 15, 25, and 50%) against dengue fever female mosquito’s A. aegypti. This study was carried out in a laboratory
screen cage condition which gives protection against mosquito bites.
No allergic complaints have been reported from the tested persons.
In comparison with N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET) available in commercial antimosquito
repellant compounds, our essential oil was found to show greater activity.
The essential oil showed the highest repellent percentage (6.66 ±
1.5) at 50% concentration in 60 min against A. aegypti female mosquitoes. The present study shows that increase in the
concentration of the essential oil leads to increase in the protection
time leading to prolonged repellent activity against A. aegypti mosquitoes. Citrus plant’s essential oil was reported to have a protection percentage
from 10.0 ± 8.7 to 65.0 ± 22.9 min, biting rate ranged from
1.2 to 2.3% and protection ranged from 98.3 to 98.8%, respectively.34 The benzene and methanol extracts of A. vulgaris were previously reported to have repellent
activity against A. aegypti.35 Repellent activity proved that the Zingiber cassumunar essential oil has greater activity
against C. quinquefasciatus (165 min
protection time and 0.9% biting rate) and A. aegypti (90 min protection time and 0.8% biting rate).36 Dry flower powder of Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium has been used as insecticides since ancient times.37 Some natural products obtained from plants play a major
role in the development of commercial insecticide. For instance, α-terthienyl
has been known for its herbicidal activity.38 The skin test for evaluating the repellency of catnip oil is found
to have two major active ingredients (Z, E-nepeta lactone and E, Z-nepetalactone).39 Earlier reports show
that 3-carene, α-terpinene, limonene, γ-terpinene, terpinolene,
and (−)-terpinen-4-ol isolated from C. japonica essential oil are active against the A. aegypti(40) and A. Albopictus, while confertifolin compound isolated from P. hydropiper essential oil is exhibiting a good repellent activity (100% adulticidal
activity against A. albopictus).41 These observations indicate that our results
are very promising to formulate a potent and affordable essential
oil against the dengue fever vector A. aegypti.

2.4 Molecular
Docking with NS3 Protease
Density functional theory (DFT)
calculations in conjugation with
molecular docking analysis helps to understand the mechanism by which
the small molecule (ligand) binds into the active site of large biomolecules.42,43 Molecular docking analysis also provides the nature of interactions
that exists between protein and ligand in the protein–ligand
complex.44,45 Hence, in the present work, molecular docking
calculations were carried out using the DFT-optimized ligand molecules.
MD simulations of the tetrapeptide (PDB code 2FP7) of this enzyme
complex with an inhibitor binding were reported in important of DV-2
NS2B/NS3 protease.11,46,47 The NS3 protease protein cleaves the poly protein precursor into
individual efficient proteins, which play an important role in the
replication cycle of DV.48,49 Therefore, the identified
major active components (E)-β-caryophyllene,
(Z)-β-caryophyllene, α-humulene, and
β-caryophyllene oxide were docked into the active site of NS3
protease to identify which one of these is the most effective compound.
The flexible molecular docking was carried out by Glide XP (Extra
precision) mode of docking (Glide, version 6.8, Schrodinger, LLC,
New York, NY, 2015). The parameters used for docking are as follows:
number of poses per ligand 500, van der Waals radii 0.80, and default
parameters for strain corrections and clustering panel. The docked
pose was selected based on the highest Glide score and lowest binding
energy conformer, and it was used for further analysis. The docked
systems show a buried beneath of the NS3 protease surface (Figures 3 and 4). All the complexes are located at the same binding pocket.
The docked complexes are interacting with various amino acid residues
in the NS3 protease receptor-binding pocket surface (Figure 4). The crucial ligand-protein-binding
free energy for (E)-β-caryophyllene, (Z)-β-caryophyllene, α-humulene, and β-caryophyllene
oxide are −2.747, −2.609, −2.574, and −2.342
kcal/mol, respectively. These energy values clearly show that all
the terpenoid compounds have binding energies in the same range, and
(E)-β-caryophyllene, among the four, strongly
binds to the NS3 protease than other three complexes. The protein–ligand
interactions could be understood based on the nature of the interaction
between ligand and NS3 protease. Hydrogen bond, hydrophobic and ion
pair interactions, and water bridges between ligand and active site
residues play a key role in the accommodation of small molecule into
the catalytic domain of a protein.50,51 (E)-β-Caryophyllene is found to interact with various noncovalent
forces such as hydrophobic and ionic interactions. Mainly, (E)-β-caryophyllene interacts through hydrophobic interactions
with NS3 protease amino acid residues LEU76, MET49, TRP83, LEU85,
ILE139, VAL146, VAL147, LEU149, TYP150, and ILE165; ASP75 and GLU88
are charged (negative) interactions with NS3 protease.

acid residues in the NS3 protease protein-binding pocket.

3 Conclusions
The
essential oil extracted from hydrodistillation of dried leaves
of A. vulgaris exhibits good insecticidal
property against A. aegypti, a dengue
fever vector. GC–MS analysis of the oil shows that there are
63 compounds and they have been identified with GC–MS (NIST
2005) software. Among the terpeniods, Campher (26.99%), α-humulene
(0.72%), β-caryophyllene (0.8%), and β-caryophyllene oxide
(15.87%) are important insecticidal compounds. Exposure of the third
stage larvae for 12 and 24 h at 100 ppm showed highest mortality respectively
with LC50 = 38.31 ppm and LC90 = 6.87 ppm, whereas
the fourth stage larvae showed highest mortality LC50 =
135.24 ppm and LC90 = 4.26 ppm, respectively. Histological
images revealed that the volatile oil compounds α-humulene,
β-caryophyllene, and β-caryophyllene oxide affected ct,
mg, and dt regions. A. aegypti female
mosquitos after exposure showed the highest repellent percentage (6.66%)
at 50% concentration with ethyl acetate solution in 60 min. NS3 protease
which plays a key role in the replication cycle of dengue virus was
docked with the four active components of this essential oil (E)-β-caryophyllene, (Z)-β-caryophyllene,
α-humulene, and β-caryophyllene oxide, and computational
details show that (E)-β-caryophyllene binds
strongly to the NS3 protease receptor and the protein ligand complex
is stabilized by hydrophobic and ionic interactions and water bridges
between the ligand and the amino acid residues in the receptor-binding
pocket. This study concluded that β-caryophyllene has a good
therapeutic potential to treat the life-threatening dengue fever.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Plant Material
The leaves of A. vulgaris were collected
from the Departmental
garden from the Department of Botany, Bharathidasan University, Tiruchirappalli,
Tamil Nadu, India.

4.2 Isolation of the Essential
Oil
The
collected healthy leaves were washed thoroughly under the running
tap water and air-shade-dried for 1 or 2 weeks at room temperature.
Then, the dried leaves were used to get oil from hydrodistillation
using Clevenger type of apparatus after 4 h. The essential oil thus
obtained was stored in an amber color glass vial (sealed with parafilm)
stored at 4 °C for further experiments on larvicidal and repellent
activity.

4.3 Identification of the Essential Oil Compound
by GC–MS Analysis
The identification of the chemical
constituents of the essential oil was carried out by GC–MS
using PerkinElmer Clarus 500, Turbo mass version 5.2.0. The column
type Capillary Column Elite-5ms (5% phenyl 95% dimethylpolysiloxane)
was used, and the total running time is 62 min, the injector temperature
is at 250 °C, and the oven initial temperature was set at 60
°C. Helium gas was used with a flow rate 1 mL/min, and the essential
oil sample 0.6 μL was injected in the split mode in the ratio
of 1:30; the percentage of the compound of essential oil was calculated
by the GC peak areas. The mass spectrum was recorded with mass scan
range 40–450 amu, electron ionization, and 70 eV. Then, transfer
line and source temperature were kept at 180 and 160 °C. The
identification of the spectrum components was compared with the database
of the spectrum of known components provided in the GC–MS (NIST
2005) library software.

4.4 Bioassay of Larvicidal
Activity
The
eggs of A. aegypti were received from
the Center for Research in Medical Entomology, Madurai, Tamil Nadu,
India. Then, larvae eggs were maintained in the Department of Botany,
Bharathidasan University. The larvae were fed on dog biscuits and
yeast powder in the 1:1 ratio through the mountain at 28 ± 2
°C temperatures 70–85% relative humidity with a photoperiod
of 12 h light and 12 h dark. The early A. aegypti third and fourth larvae stages were used for bioassay of larvicidal
activity of A. vulgaris essential oil,
and it was evaluated according to the World Health Organization (WHO)
standard protocol.52 The efficacy of larvicidal
activity was tested against the essential oil dissolved in 1 mL of
ethyl acetate and various concentrations were prepared viz., 5, 10,
25, 50, and 100 ppm. Thirty larvae of A. vulgaris of third and fourth stages were used for the larvicidal bioassay
and maintained three replicates in each concentration of essential
oil was carried out and using the dead larvae after 12 and 24 h of
the exposure period was used. The lethal concentrations LC50 and LC90 at which concentration (ppm) 50% of larvae showed
mortality and 95% confidence limit of upper and lower confidence levels
were calculated by probit analysis (SPSS, version 16.0).  

4.5 Histological Analysis
Histological
test of newly ecdysed A. aegypti larvae
was carried out with the highest mortality rate of third and fourth
stage larvae. In this experiment, only live larvae were examined.
Then, the larvae were fixed with 10% formaldehyde solution for 24
h, after which the solution was dehydrated with ethanol series and
cleared xylene solutions. The larvae were embedded in melted thin
paraffin wax and the section was cut with 5 μM thickness glass
knives in a rotary microtome than; the larvae were stained using hematoxylin
and eosin. The slide was inspected, analyzed, and photographed with
a light microscope (Olympus CX31).

4.6 Repellent
Activity
A. vulgaris leaf
essential oil was evaluated at various
concentrations (2.5, 5, 15, 25, and 50%) in ethyl acetate and control
DEET against the A. aegypti mosquitoes,
and biting testing time was 15, 30, and 60 min, and it was examined
through laboratory screen cages (diameter 40 cm × length 30 cm)
containing 50 nulliparous, nonblood fed, starved female mosquitoes.53 Human volunteer’s hands were washed and
cleaned using distilled water, and both hands were covered with rubber
gloves with a window (4 cm × 5 cm) on the forearm before the
repellent application. The A. aegypti mosquito biting test was carried out between 8:00 a.m. and 4:00
p.m. and a total number of mosquitoes biting were recorded forearm
after 3 min of the study period. The mosquito biting percentage was
calculated for each test using the formula:  

4.7 Molecular Docking
4.7.1 Computational
Details
The DFT calculations
were carried out with B3LYP54,55 functional using Gaussian
09.56 The ground state geometries of the
(E)-β-caryophyllene, (Z)-β-caryophyllene,
α-humulene, and β-caryophyllene oxide were optimized using
the standard 6-311++g (d,p) basis set. The coordinates of caryophyllene
complexes were taken from optimized geometries as a molfile, and they
were converted into PDB format using GaussView 5.0.9 software.57 The physiological medium and ionization states
were determined for all caryophyllene ligands, and the pH was set
to 7.0 by the ligand preparation using “LigPrep” module,
followed by minimization and conformational searched modules of the
maestro. The crystal structure of both active forms with a cocrystallized
substrate-based inhibitor NS3 protease (PDB IDS: 2FOM) was retrieved from
the protein data bank (https://www.rcsb.org/pdb). Proteins were prepared by the necessary key steps, followed by
hydrogen atoms, missing side chains, and loops were added using a
protein preparation “PRIME” module. All water molecules
and heteroatoms were removed from the receptor protein, followed by
the receptor was refined by minimization and optimization using the
OPLS 2005 force field in the protein preparation module of Schrodinger’s
Maestro Molecular Modeling suit. After ligand and protein preparation,
grid generation was done according to the active site of the protein.
Docking calculation was performed using the energy minimized (E)-β-caryophyllene, (Z)-β-Caryophyllene,
α-humulene, and β-caryophyllene oxide with NS2B/NS3 protease
as the host using Glide (Glide, Version 6.8, Schrodinger, LLC, New
York, NY, 2015) by means of XP precision mode and its output Glide
score was calculated.58 Finally, visualization
of the docked system has been analyzed using PyMOL software package.59
