The
CO2 capture from back-up power plants by making
use of calcium looping systems combined with large piles of Ca-solids
has been studied in this work. A flexible CO2 capture system
based on a concept described in a previous work has been integrated
into an existing power plant by including a small oxy-fired calciner
(that represents just 8% of the total thermal capacity) to steadily
regenerate the sorbent and a carbonator reactor following the back-up
power plant operation periods to capture 90% of the CO2 as CaCO3 and two large piles of rich CaO and CaCO3 solids stored at modest temperatures. When the back-up plant
enters into operation, the calcined solids are brought into contact
with the flue gases in the carbonator reactor; meanwhile, the oxy-calciner
operates continuously at a steady state. In order to improve the flexibility
of the CO2 capture system and to minimize the increase
of CO2 capture costs associated with the additional new
equipment used only during the brief back-up periods, we propose using
the steam cycle of the existing power plant to recover a large fraction
of the heat available from the streams leaving the carbonator. This
makes it possible to maintain the electrical power output but reducing
the thermal input to the power plant by 12% and thus the size of the
associated CO2 capture equipment. To generate the auxiliary
power required for the oxy-calciner block, a small steam cycle is
designed by integrating the waste heat from the streams leaving this
reactor. By solving the mass and heat balances and proposing a feasible
thermal integration scheme by using Aspen Hysys, it has been calculated
that the CO2 emitted by long-amortized power plants operated
as back-up can be captured with a net efficiency of 28%.

1 Introduction
Renewable
power is expected to be the dominant energy source in
future energy networks, with shares of the total electricity demand
of between 75 and 80% by 2060.1,2 Back-up combustion and/or
energy storage systems will be required to maintain the balance between
supply and demand in such systems.2,3 Existing amortized
coal power plants operated as back-up could be favored in such future
electricity grids by market mechanisms, as they use a relatively low-cost
fuel and can be largely amortized.3−6

However, the decarbonization of these
combustion back-up power
plants by means of CO2 capture and storage (CCS) technologies
will be needed to accomplish the aggressive CO2 emission
reduction targets established for the next few decades.7 CCS systems have a limited flexibility to cope
with the fluctuations in the flue gas loads and, what is more, their
high investment costs seriously limit their applicability at low capacity
factors (CFs).8−14 A number of solutions have been proposed in the literature to increase
the flexibility of the CO2 capture systems, most of which
involve the storage of different functional materials. The storage
of a fraction of the rich solvent has been studied in post-combustion
amine-based CO2 capture systems14−16 to reduce the
consumption of power in the regeneration and CO2 compression
units (CPU) during the periods of peak power demand, so that these
operations can be postponed to when there is less demand. The storage
of O2 in cryogenic tanks during low power demand periods
while operating the air separation unit (ASU) in base mode has been
proposed for oxy-combustion systems.17−19 Similarly, the storage
of H2 in pre-combustion CO2 capture systems
has been analyzed to decouple the generation of power from H2 production.20,21 However, these approaches are
aimed at achieving short-term flexibility (i.e., ranging from minutes
to hours) to cover short peaks characterized by a fast response. In
the case of seasonal back-up (i.e., operating only a few weeks per
year), such CO2 systems will be penalized due to the required
large-capacity storage of costly materials (such as amines) or due
to the use of large-scale storage equipment (i.e., for cryogenic O2 or pressurized H2).

A CO2 capture
process to improve the flexibility of
calcium looping (CaL) technology has been recently proposed in order
to take advantage of the low specific cost of the solids required
for large-scale storage, that is, CaO and CaCO3 derived
from crushed limestone.22 CaL technology
has advanced rapidly in the last decade and it has been demonstrated
at TRL6 in several pilot plants.23−28 The similarity of its core components, the circulating fluidized
bed (CFB) carbonator and calciner reactors, with existing CFB boiler
technology has led to several testing and modeling studies,29−33 process simulation, and integration34−38 as well as cost analyses33,39−41 in a wide range of configurations. Despite the progress
achieved in the CaL technology, the flexibility of CaL systems against
flue gas load changes has received relatively low attention until
recently.42−44 Some authors have also simulated CaL-based energy
storage systems for CCS45,46 and solar power applications,47 respectively, by making use of the thermal and/or
thermochemical energy contained in the streams and/or reactions of
the CaL system.

In the present work, we investigate the thermal
integration of
a particular reference flexible CaL case that could be used to extend
the life of existing coal-fired power plants operated as back-up power
systems. The main goal for this system is to minimize the cost of
the carbon-free back-up power service by reducing the capital investment
associated with the CO2 capture. In addition, this process
aims to moderate as much as possible energy penalties and to concentrate
them in periods of low power demand. For this purpose, the use of
the existing power plant steam cycle to integrate the heat available
from the carbonation reaction has been studied in this work as a mean
to reduce the cost of the CaL equipment, which is essential for its
viability when operating under the low CFs expected in any decarbonized
back-up power system.

2 Process Description
The general scheme of the CO2 capture system analyzed
in this work (referred to as “FlexiCaL” from this point
on) is presented in Figure 1. This process presents features in common with a conventional
CaL configuration, such as the use of two CFB reactors, the carbonator
and the calciner, but it also includes additional features to ensure
the flexible operation of the CO2 capture system, as was
discussed in our previous work.22

Figure 1 Schematic representation
of the highly flexible back-up fossil
power plant with CO2 capture by CaL including CaO/CaCO3 storage (FlexiCaL).

As shown in Figure 1, one of the main characteristics of the FlexiCaL system is the use
of two low-cost piles (or silos) of CaO- and CaCO3-rich
material (referred to as CaO and CaCO3 piles for simplicity,
although other minor components such as sulfates or ash may also be
present). These piles could be dimensioned as to allow the complete
decoupling of the carbonator and calciner operation modes. Thus, calcined
solids from the CaO pile are fed directly into the carbonator to react
with the CO2 present in the flue gas when the back-up power
plant enters into operation. Meanwhile, the carbonated solids leaving
this reactor are stored in the CaCO3 pile and the “free”
CO2 gas stream is released. The FlexiCaL process in Figure 1 aims to minimize
the temperature of the piles in order to facilitate the handling and
storage of the CaO and CaCO3 materials. As shown below,
different integration schemes can be used to achieve this objective,
reducing the temperature of the solids in the piles to below 250 °C.

As a high-temperature solid looping system, typical calcium looping
schemes are characterized by its ability to recover waste heat in
a boiler, not only from the exothermic carbonation reaction that typically
takes place at 650 °C48 but also from
the integration of the gas and/or solids streams leaving the carbonator
and calciner reactors. Unlike most CaL schemes that use boiler-type
carbonators, the carbonator reactor in the process depicted in Figure 1 is assumed to be
an adiabatic reactor from which no heat is recovered for power production.
However, a significant amount of thermal energy can be recovered from
the gas and solids streams leaving the carbonator reactor to produce
power. Because the process in Figure 1 only targets extremely low CFs, the use of an additional
steam cycle linked to the gas and solids streams from the carbonator
is ruled out in this work in an attempt to minimize waste of capital.
Therefore, a new approach is adopted in this work to recover part
of the energy from the carbonation using the steam cycle of the existing
back-up power plant. The availability of such thermal capacity from
the carbonation allows a certain reduction of the coal thermal input.
This leads to a reduction in the flow of CO2 produced in
the power plant and, therefore, in the amount of sorbent needed in
the carbonator. Different integration schemes can be adopted to incorporate
both the thermal power from the power plant and the carbonation heat
available into a single steam cycle. In standard CaL schemes, some
of these options where investigated by Yang et al.36 However and in order to minimize the modifications in the
power plant steam cycle and, thus, the capital cost, we have considered
only the use of the carbonation heat to preheat the water entering
the boiler, as discussed in the following section.

3 Results and Discussion
A reference case is proposed to illustrate
the performance of the
FlexiCaL system of Figure 1. The power plant, carbonator, and oxy-calciner, as well as
the associated steam cycles have been modeled using Aspen Hysys to
solve the mass and energy balances in steady-state mode; meanwhile,
the nonsteady operations related with the switching on and off of
the power plant and carbonator block for the back-up periods has been
left outside the scope of this work. Relevant parameters and values
for the reference case described below are summarized in Table 1 and the different
major elements in Figure 1 are detailed below.

As general considerations for the analysis in the
following sections,
it has been assumed that heat losses in the solid piles can be neglected
considering their low surface-to-volume ratio, and in gas–solid
heat-exchange operations taking place in cyclonic preheaters, the
outlet stream temperatures are equalized and the heat exchange efficiency
in the steam cycles is of 95%.

As in other CaL systems and as
considered for the reference case
here presented, an additional benefit of the FlexiCaL process in Figure 1 is its potential
synergy with a large-scale CaO consumer such as a cement plant. As
in typical CaL, a certain flow of fresh limestone (make-up flow, F0) is fed into the calciner in order to compensate
for the decay in the sorbent’s CO2 carrying capacity
and also to purge the inserts from the inventory of solids (ashes
and CaSO4 formed in the oxy-calciner). In addition, the
low CFs of the system in Figure 1 allows for very high activity materials in the solid
storage piles when employing make-up flows of limestone that satisfy
the requirements of a typical cement plant.

3.1 Reference
Coal-Fired Power Plant
An existing coal-fired power plant
providing a net electric power
of 350 MWe is considered to be the back-up system and the
source of the flue gas fed into the carbonator. This power plant employs
a supercritical steam cycle operating with live steam at 600 °C
and 280 bar. Figure 2 shows a simplified scheme of the steam cycle of the existing power
plant. The main operation conditions of the steam cycle have been
adopted from the data available in the literature49 and assuming that a 5% of the gross power output is consumed
by the auxiliaries, resulting in a net power efficiency of 45% (defined
as the ratio between the net electrical output and the thermal input
to the power plant). As a back-up system, the power plant is assumed
to run at full load when it enters into operation, but with a low
CF of 0.1 averaged over 1 year. During the operation periods, a coal
thermal input of 777 MWth is fed into the power plant,
producing a flue gas flow of 10.4 kmol/s at 140 °C with 15.3
% v of CO2. This power plant is assumed to be equipped
with a desulfurization unit and, therefore, no SO2 is emitted
with the flue gas.

3.2 Back-Up CO2 Capture and Thermal
Integration of the Carbonator Block
A CO2 capture
efficiency of 90% has been chosen as the target in the carbonator
operating at a temperature of 650 °C. An average CO2 carrying capacity (Xave) of 0.35 has
been assumed. This value has been taken by considering that the flow
of fresh limestone to the oxy-calciner reactor (F0) is continuous (even when the carbonator and hence the
power plant are not operating). This results in a flow of CaO particles
with a high activity accumulating in the CaO pile that only react
with CO2 when the power plant and thus the carbonator enter
into operation in back-up mode. For the sake of simplicity, it is
considered that there is sufficient gas–solid contact time
in the carbonator reactor to allow a conversion of 80% with respect
to the maximum conversion attainable by the solids (Xave). This high level of conversion has been demonstrated
to be feasible in several large-scale calcium looping pilot plants
where the carbonator reactor is a CFB operated with active space times
of around 20–80 s.23,50,51

The operation temperature of the adiabatic carbonator is directly
linked to the conversion of the solids and the inlet temperature of
the calcined solids entering the reactor. Several integration approaches
can be put in practice to preheat the gas and solids streams entering
the carbonator. These will ensure that, even for modest solid storage
temperatures, standard temperatures of around 650 °C are achieved
in the adiabatic carbonator during the steady-state operation mode
thanks to the exothermic carbonation of CaO. In this way, the high-temperature
heat available in the CO2 “free” gas stream
can be employed to heat up the flow of CaO stored at modest temperature
before it enters into the carbonator reactor. Alternatively, the hot
CaCO3 leaving the carbonator reactor can be used to preheat
the flue gas. These heat-exchange operations can be carried out by
means of conventional gas–solid heat transfer methods or gas–solid
cyclonic suspension preheaters, such as those available in cement
plants.

For this specific case with a Xave of
0.35, a solids inlet temperature of 410 °C is needed for the
carbonator to operate at a temperature of 650 °C. This can be
achieved by bringing the flue gas leaving the carbonator into contact
with the solids coming from the CaO pile (as depicted in Figure 3), assuming that
they have been stored at a temperature of 156 °C (please note
that the CaO pile is feed from solids coming from the oxy-calciner
reactor after recovering part of their heat for power production,
as detailed in the following section). In comparison with the previously
proposed scheme,22 this preheating step
allows the storage temperature in the CaO pile to be reduced by around
330 °C if the carbonator is operating at 650 °C. After this
preheating step, the residual heat from the CO2 flue gas
and the heat available in the stream of carbonated solids leaving
the carbonator can be integrated within the existing power plant steam
cycle in the feedwater preheater sections, as schematically shown
on the right-hand side of Figure 3. The heat available from the CaCO3 stream
can be used both in the high- and low-pressure feedwater heaters,
thereby avoiding bleeds of steam from the high-, intermediate-, and
part of the low-pressure turbines. The heat contained in the solids
can be extracted in counter-current mode in moving bed heat exchangers
(similar to that proposed by Nsakala et al.52 for oxy-fired power plants). On the other hand, the waste heat available
in the CO2 “free” stream after the CaO preheating
step can be used in the low-pressure feedwater preheater section by
extracting heat in counter-current water–gas heat exchangers.
In this way, all of the low pressure steam bleeds can be avoided.
In both heat exchangers, the temperature of the water before entering
the deaerator and the economizer has been kept constant as in the
reference power plant and the outlet temperatures of the solids and
gases have been calculated.

Figure 3 Carbonator block process scheme including the
integration of the
solids and gas streams (left) and the modified power plant supercritical
steam cycle of Figure 2 where pressure (P in bar), temperature (T in °C), and mass flow (m in kg/s)
operation conditions for the reference case are indicated (right).

The use of heat from the gas and solids streams
to heat up the
water in the feedwater heaters allows the existing steam cycle to
operate in two different ways, by increasing the effective power of
the steam turbine or by reducing the power plant thermal input. On
the one hand, the coal thermal input can be maintained at its nominal
load of 777 MWth and the extra carbonation heat can be
used to boost the electrical power output from the power plant steam
turbines. On the other hand, the coal thermal input in the back-up
power plant can be reduced while producing the same electrical output
of 350 MWe as in the reference back-up power plant. One
of the advantages of this second approach is that the amount of CO2 produced during coal combustion decreases and, therefore,
the size of the FlexiCaL elements and streams can be reduced. For
these reasons, this second approach has been adopted in this study
and the process of Figure 1 has been designed to produce the same net electrical output
as in the reference power plant. Although there are some minor changes
to the steam flow in the different turbine sections with respect to
the reference case due to the absence of bleeds (<15%), the effect
of these changes on the isentropic efficiencies of the steam turbine
sections can be safely ignored and the same values of pressure and
temperature as those shown in Figure 2 have been assumed.53

By following this second approach, the thermal power plant input
can be reduced by 12% (i.e., down to 685 MWth) with respect
to the reference case. As is discussed in the following sections,
the net efficiency of the whole FlexiCaL system will be lower due
to the penalty associated with the fuel requirements in the oxy-calciner
block. This integration scheme makes it possible to transfer around
145 MWth for water preheating in the steam cycle from the
solids leaving the carbonator, which are cooled down to a temperature
of 207 °C before being sent to the CaCO3 pile. Meanwhile,
the temperature of the CO2 “free” gas stream
is reduced to 161 °C before it is emitted, providing 61 MWth for the low-pressure feedwater preheaters. As a result,
a total amount of 206 MWth from the carbonator block is
used to produce power in the existing steam cycle. The elimination
of steam bleeds from the turbine has a penalty effect on the net steam
cycle efficiency (defined as the ratio between the net electrical
power output and total thermal power input to the steam generator
and feed water sections of the steam cycle) as this is reduced from
48% in the reference steam cycle of Figure 2 to 42% in the configuration shown in the
right-hand side of Figure 3 where the steam bleeds from the turbines are avoided.54 A summary of the main results of the balances
solved for the carbonator block in the selected reference case is
presented in Table 2 with the specifications of the process streams numbered in Figure 3.

3.3 Sorbent Regeneration and Thermal Integration
of the Oxy-Calciner Block
The equipment required for the
regeneration of the sorbent includes a refractory adiabatic CFB combustor-calciner
as well as an ASU that provides the required O2 and a CO2 compression and purification unit (CPU). The use of the solids
piles allow to be operated in continuous mode. Thus, a continuous
flow of carbonated solids is fed into the oxy-calciner from the CaCO3 pile which acts as a buffer. As a result, a more reduced
flow of solids goes from the CaCO3 to the CaO pile through
the oxy-calciner compared to the flow of calcined solids that is fed
into the carbonator when the power plant is in operation. This also
allows the size of the main components related with the calcination
step to be reduced, as schematically shown in Figure 1; meanwhile, a modest flow of CO2 is generated in steady state in the oxy-fired calciner. This should
facilitate both the transport and storage of CO2 because
the range of geological CO2 storage sites broadens thanks
to the reduced amount of CO2 to be stored per year.

To satisfy the electricity requirements of the ASU, CPU, and other
auxiliary units associated with the oxy-calciner block, heat from
the gas and solids streams leaving the oxy-calciner reactor can be
recovered for power generation in a separate small steam cycle. After
recovery, the remaining waste heat from these streams can be further
employed to preheat the gas and solids entering the calciner in order
to reduce the heat demand and fuel consumption, as below described.
For the sake of simplicity, coal is assumed to be the fuel in the
calciner. However, in future scenarios with a wider availability of
renewable electricity, electrolytic hydrogen and oxygen could be available
(as first pointed out by Steinbeck and Dettmann55) at a reasonable cost,56 or
other alternative biofuels could be employed to fire the small calciner
required to regenerate the sorbent.

A temperature of 910 °C
is considered to completely regenerate
the CaCO3 in the oxy-calciner reactor. Coal (78.8% C, 4.7%
H, 0.7% S, 5.8% O, 2.6% H2O, 1.2% N, and 6.2% ash, heating
lower value of 32.5 MJ/kg) is burned using oxygen supplied from an
ASU with a purity of 95% and in an excess of a 10%. In order to estimate
the make-up flow of limestone (F0), the
equation proposed by Rodríguez et al.57 has been used taking into account the effect of the CF on the average
CO2 flow fed into the carbonator (FCO2) as indicated in a previous work.22 This yields a F0/(FCO2CF) ratio of 0.37 which
translates into an annual limestone consumption of 0.16 Mton/year.

Most of the high-temperature heat available in the streams of gas
and solids leaving the oxy-calciner reactor is used to produce power
in a subcritical steam cycle, as shown in Figure 4. Pressure and temperature conditions in
this cycle have been chosen in accordance with the data available
in the literature.58 To provide the required
power for this subcritical steam cycle, heat is extracted from the
CaO solids and CO2-rich gas streams arriving from the oxy-calciner
at a temperature of 910 °C in accordance with the scheme shown
in the left-hand side of Figure 4. A minimum pinch temperature of 25 °C has been
assumed in the different heat exchangers. In the proposed integration
scheme, the heat contained in the CO2-rich gas leaving
the calciner is used in the reheating, superheating, economizer, and
high-pressure feedwater preheater sections, which allows this stream
to cool down to 385 °C. The waste heat from this gas stream is
then recovered to preheat the stream of CaCO3 solids and
the make-up flow of limestone respectively before they enter the oxy-calciner.
These heat exchanges steps allows the CO2-rich flue gas
stream temperature to be further reduced to 207 °C before it
is sent to the CPU unit.

and gas streams (left)
and the sub-critical steam cycle (right). Pressure (P in bar) and temperature (T in °C) operation
conditions for the steam cycle obtained from data available in the
literature.58,59 Mass flow (m in kg/s) reported for the reference case solved with an oxy-calciner
gross electrical output of 12.5 MWe.

The heat contained in the calcined solids is also used in the superheating,
evaporation, economizer, and low-pressure feedwater heater sections,
as shown in Figure 4. This reduces the CaO stream temperature to 183 °C. In order
to further cool down the solids and achieve the temperature needed
in the CaO pile (i.e., 156 °C as discussed in Section 3.2), the waste heat can be
employed to preheat the flow of O2 fed into the oxy-calciner,
as indicated in Figure 4. More detailed specifications of the process streams numbered in Figure 4 for the oxy-calciner
block can be found in Table 3.

66 MWth is calculated. This represents a fraction of only
8% with respect to the total thermal capacity (including that of the
back-up power plant). This compares favorably with conventional CaL
systems that require a typical thermal capacity of around 45–50%
for the oxy-fired calciner.31 Another benefit
of the system proposed is that a continuous flow of 0.31 kmol/s of
CO2 is produced in the calciner in contrast with the large
flow of CO2 captured from the power plant emitted during
operation periods at a rate of 1.41 kmol/s. Consequently, the size
of the CPU needed is reduced by almost 78%.

With the integration
of Figure 4, a gross
efficiency of 40% is calculated for the oxy-calciner
block, resulting in a gross electrical power output (Pe gross,oxy-calciner) of 12.5 MWe. On
the basis of typical assumptions for power consumption in the main
elements of the oxy-calciner block (i.e., 5% of the gross power output
in the auxiliaries60 and 200 kWhe/tO2 and 120 kWhe/tCO2 in the ASU and CPU units, respectively61), an internal consumption of around 11 MWe is
estimated for the oxy-calciner block. Thus, it can be assumed that
no net power is produced by the steam cycle associated with the calciner.
The power delivered to the grid comes only from the steam cycle associated
with the back-up power plant and carbonator blocks.

3.4 Global Process Performance
Accordingly
to the discussion of the previous sections, the net efficiency of
the FlexiCaL system (ηFlexiCaL) as depicted in Figure 1, exporting power
only during a fraction of the time CF and considering that the net
power output is zero from the oxy-calciner thermal input, can be calculated
using the following equation 1  where Pe,net is
the net electrical power produced in the system and Pth,power plant and Pth,oxy-calciner are the thermal inputs to the power plant and the oxy-fired calciner,
respectively, and reported in the previous sections. The thermal input
associated with the calcination of the fresh limestone (Pth,F0) can be discounted considering
the benefits from the potential use of the CaO-rich purge (around
0.1 Mton/year) in a cement plant or another large-scale CaO consumer.
From eq 1, a ηFlexiCaL of 28% is calculated; meanwhile, the net power efficiency
of the reference power plant without CO2 capture was of
45%. Despite this modest value it should be emphasized that the energy
penalty related to the regeneration of the sorbent is applied during
the whole operating period, while the back-up power plant is able
to deliver a net power output of 350 MWe to the grid when
it is required to enter into operation and capturing the CO2 in the flue gas with a 90% efficiency.

Regarding the capacity
of the CaO and CaCO3 piles depicted in Figure 1, around 20 800 and
25 100 m3, respectively, (assuming a bulk density
of 1000 kg/m3) are needed per operation day of the back-up
power plant. As mentioned above, for the integration scheme proposed,
the CaO and CaCO3 are stored at temperatures of around
150–200 °C. This facilitates the solid handling and storage
operations by making it possible to use equipment normally employed
in other processes (e.g., in the cement industry).22

Finally, the main process parameters of the reference
case solved
in the previous sections have been summarized in Table 4. The reference case here studied
shows that the FlexiCaL process configuration represents a promising
CO2 capture system for retrofitting and extending the lifetime
of amortized back-up fossil fuel power plants forced to operate under
extremely low-capacity factors.

4 Conclusions
Calcium looping system relying on large reservoirs
of low-temperature
CaCO3 and CaO can be used to capture the CO2 emitted from existing back-up coal power plant forced to operate
under extremely low CFs. One of the main features of the FlexiCaL
process is the use of existing equipment in the power plant to minimize
the need of additional equipment associated with the CO2 capture and to avoid waste of capital. The thermal integration exercise
carried out reveals that it is possible to maintain the net power
output of the back-up plant with capture, by sacrificing the efficiency
of the system when regenerating the CaCO3 to CaO. This
is because the proposed system includes an adiabatic carbonator reactor
that can follow the power plant operation periods, whereas the small-scale
oxy-calciner block produces power for the autoconsumption in the air
separation and compression units (i.e., zero net power exports). A
reference case solved for a CF of 0.1 indicates that 12% of the energy
during back-up power operations comes from the heat recovered from
the carbonator block when using the feedwater preheater sections of
the existing power plant steam cycle. For a reference output of 350
MWe, and assuming a reasonable solids storage activity
(Xave of 0.35), a thermal input of just
66 MWth (which represents only 8% of the total thermal
capacity of the system) is required in the oxy-calciner block to achieve
the complete regeneration of the carbonated solids, storing the solids
at moderate temperatures of around 150–200 °C. A large
volume of solid reservoirs is needed (around 20 000–25 000
m3 of bulk solids per day operating at full load), but
the very low specific cost of CaO and CaCO3 materials could
make this process attractive in future scenarios where capture of
CO2 from back-up power plants may be needed.
