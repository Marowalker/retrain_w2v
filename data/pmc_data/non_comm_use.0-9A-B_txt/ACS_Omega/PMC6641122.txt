Controlling
the emission efficiency, direction, and polarization
of optical sources with nanoantennas is of crucial importance in many
nanophotonic applications. In this article, we design a subwavelength
multilayer metal–dielectric nanoantenna consisting of three
identical gold strips that are separated by two dielectric spacers.
It is shown that a local dipole source can efficiently excite several
hybridized plasmonic modes in the nanoantenna, including one electric
dipole (ED) and two magnetic dipole (MD) resonances. The coherent
interplay between the ED and MDs leads to unidirectional emissions
in opposite directions at different wavelengths. The relative phase
difference between these resonant modes determines the exact emission
direction. Additionally, with a proper spacer thickness and filling
medium, it is possible to control the spectral positions of the forward
and backward unidirectional emissions and to exchange the wavelengths
for two unidirectional emissions. An analytical dipole model is established,
which yields comparable results to those from the full-wave simulation.
Furthermore, we show that the wavelength of the peak forward-to-backward
unidirectionality is essentially determined by the MD and is approximately
predictable by the plasmonic wave dispersion in the corresponding
two-dimensional multilayer structure. Our results may be useful to
design dual-band unidirectional optical nanoantennas.

Introduction
Optical nanoantennas
have been studied widely over the past decades,
mostly for their ability to confine the optical fields into volumes
of size far below the wavelength of the incoming light.1 Such nanoantennas are often characterized by
different metrics, including scattering efficiency, directivity, emission
pattern, and operating frequency bandwidth.2−4 Among these
metrics, directional nanoantennas are particularly useful for modulating
and steering the energy radiated by a single quantum emitter (e.g.,
a quantum dot or nitrogen-vacancy center) and enable the creation
of an efficient single-photon source.5−8 Moreover, a highly unidirectional receiving
nanoantenna is a suitable platform for creating a local field with
an extreme spatial gradient, which is useful to control quantum source
dynamics.9,10 Sufficiently high directionality has been
demonstrated theoretically and experimentally for numerous nanophotonic
applications,11 using Yagi–Uda antennas,12 core–shell nanoparticle arrays,13 dielectric nanoparticle arrays,14 ultracompact antennas,15−17 and even single metallic
or dielectric nanoparticles.18−22

Of special interest in this context are nanoantennas exhibiting
both electric and magnetic resonances. In general, the interferences
between the radiated optical fields from the induced electric dipole
(ED) and magnetic dipole (MD) present an additional degree of freedom
to tailor light emission characteristics, in terms of frequency, efficiency,
phase, direction, and polarization. More specifically, these interactions
allow for predictable highly unidirectional light emission if comparable
strength of magnetic and electric responses is achieved. These interactions
raise interesting possibilities for tailoring optical scattering and
emission, such as controlling the coupling between a single-photon
emitter and receiver,18,23 as well as unique processes arising
from nonlinear optical interactions.24

However, few natural materials exhibit an intrinsic MD transition,25 and even in those that do, the response is significantly
weaker than that of their ED counterparts. Alternatively, optical
magnetic responses can be achieved using nonmagnetic materials by
properly structuring noble metals or high-index dielectrics, which
behave as optical meta-atoms. The properties of such meta-atoms can
be tuned via composition, geometry, and size. For active dipolar sources
close to these structures with proper position and polarization, the
magnetic resonance may become remarkably excitable. In such a scenario,
the structure generates ED- and MD-type responses at a comparable
level.26 As such, unidirectional light
emission resulting from ED−MD interference becomes possible.5 In this regard, plasmonic particles are attractive
for such a purpose because plasmon resonance occurs with strongly
confined and substantially controllable local fields. On this basis,
one then expects large enhancement of the optical local density of
states (LDOS) that can accelerate the spontaneous emission decay and
substantial shaping of the emission patterns.

Recently, Pakizeh
and Käll proposed a kind of nanoantenna
made of a gold nanodisk dimer.17 In their
system, an ED source can efficiently excite magnetic resonance in
the dielectric gap and the induced ED and MD meet the Kerker condition.27 The local source–antenna coupled system
radiates predominantly in one particular direction. Essentially, the
directional emission is achieved by tuning the resonance wavelengths
of the antenna elements, thereby adjusting the relative phase differences
in their radiated fields. For an appropriate configuration, this may
result in constructive interference of radiation in a particular direction
and destructive interference in the opposite direction. Furthermore,
in many applications, it is of great interest to provide similar functional
operations at different and selective wavelengths simultaneously.28,29

In this work, we show that in contrast to the dimer system
a multilayer
metal–dielectric–metal (MDM) nanoantenna can support
more than one hybridized electric and magnetic dipolar modes. When
excited by a properly positioned dipole source, the phase relationship
between the different ED and MD resonant modes can be engineered and
the overall light emission is controlled predominately toward opposite
directions at different wavelengths. Furthermore, it is possible to
switch the emission directions for the same wavelengths simultaneously.
We demonstrate such a possibility by an optical nanoantenna consisting
of three gold strips that are separated by two different dielectric
layers, as schematically shown in Figure 1a. When such a nanoantenna is excited by
a nearby dipole source (e.g., a quantum dot), it allows the localized
surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) sustained by the system to strongly
interact, leading to excitation of the three hybridized plasmonic
resonant modes. The detailed excitation strength and phase relations
crucially depend on the retardation effect.30 More specifically, the parallel gold strips favor coupled electric
resonance that is formed by in-phase currents, whereas the dielectric
spacers can sustain magnetic resonances formed by out-of-phase (antigoing)
currents on the neighboring metallic strips.31 This article shows that the interference of the scattered fields
of these induced electric and magnetic resonances leads to controllable
emission with high directionality. Moreover, we demonstrate that the
emission direction can switch from one direction to the opposite direction
at different wavelengths, along the normal multilayer structure. Furthermore,
by judiciously varying the thickness and refractive index of the dielectric
spacer, it is possible to switch optical emission from the backward
(forward) direction to the forward (backward) direction at the fixed
dual-band wavelengths (see the schematic in Figure 1b,c). The designed multilayered MDM antenna
is quite flexible for steering the dipole emission. We expect that
this bidirectional antenna can be integrated with dielectric waveguides
and can provide an on-chip solution for two-color routing, which may
lead to compact devices for wavelength-selective waveguide demultiplexing.32

nanoantenna. (a) Schematic figure of the nanoantenna consisting of
three identical gold nanostrips with length l = 100
nm, width w = 100 nm, and thickness t = 20 nm, and they are separated by two different dielectric spacers
with thicknesses d1 and d2 and refractive indices n1 and n2. An ED source is positioned at
the edge of the middle strip and is polarized along the y axis. The distance between the dipole source and the upper surface
of the antenna is 10 nm. (b) Schematic representation of the color-switched
directionality effect after setting d1 = 15 nm, d2 = 25 nm, n1 = 1, and n2 = 1. The high
directionality is switched from the backward direction (+x) toward the forward direction (−x) as the
operating wavelength is changed from λ = 664 to 758 nm. (c)
Schematic representation of the color-switched directionality when
the parameters are as follows: d1 = 47
nm, d2 = 25 nm, n1 = 1.26, and n2 = 1.32. As the
relative phase of ED and MD goes from π to 0 at the resonance
of λ = 664 nm and from 0 to π at the resonance of λ
= 758 nm, the switching from forward (backward) to backward (forward)
scattering occurs at these two wavelengths.

Results and Discussion
Design and Characterization of the Nanoantenna
Figure 1a shows
the antenna
geometry, which consists of gold strips with length l = 100 nm and thickness t = 20 nm, separated by
two dielectric gap layers of thicknesses d1 and d2 and refractive indices n1 and n2. To examine
the emission properties of a nearby dipole source coupled to this
antenna (e.g., marked by the red arrow in Figure 1a), full-wave electromagnetic calculations
based on the finite element method (FEM, COMSOL Multiphysics33) are performed. The permittivity of gold is
taken from Johnson and Christy.34 To simplify
the analysis, the whole structure is assumed to be freestanding in
air (ε0 = 1). The source is assumed to be an ideal
classical dipole (no initial damping) oscillating at the emission
frequency with a dipole moment amplitude, p0 = 1/2πf C m, where f is
the working frequency. As schematically shown in Figure 1b,c, we would like to achieve
a flexible control on the highly directional emission by this MDM
antenna that is specifically coupled to the nearby ED source.

First, we consider the case in which d1 = 15 nm, d2 = 25 nm, and n1 = n2 = 1. Such a nanoantenna
can greatly enhance the LDOS, which remarkably affects the spontaneous
decay rate of the ED source.35 A figure
of merit to describe the enhancement is the radiative decay rate enhancement,
Γrad = Prad/P0, where Prad is the radiated
power flowing through a closed surface surrounding both the dipole
source and the antenna and P0 is the radiated
power of the dipole source in free space.30Figure 2a shows Prad spectra for the nanoantenna. To justify
the calculated results by the FEM, we have superimposed the results
of Prad obtained by the discrete dipole
approximation (DDA).36 Perfect agreement
between FEM (black solid curve) and DDA (green squares) is
seen in Figure 2a.
It is further seen that Prad is enhanced
more than 10 times at the two distinct peaks, λ = 672 and 746
nm, as well as at a relatively indistinguishable peak, λ ≈
621 nm (see the black solid line and the squares). This enhancement
is stronger than that in the three-layer core–shell particles.37 The three peaks correspond to three optical
resonances excited in the structure. When the nanoantenna is illuminated
by a normally incident plane wave from either the +x axis or −x axis that is linearly polarized
along the y direction, the peak at λ = 621
nm can be observed clearly in the corresponding scattering spectrum.
The resonance modes at λ = 672 and 746 nm are weakly excitable
(see Figure S1 in Supporting Information).
This indicates that the resonance at λ = 621 nm corresponds
to a superradiant (relatively bright) mode, whereas the other two
resonances at λ = 672 and 746 nm result from the subradiant
(relatively dark) modes. Furthermore, all of these modes partially
overlap in the spectrum and may have different radiation interferences
that can shape the emission pattern of a nearby active source. The
differential directionality (measured in decibels) of an antenna reads
as follows 1  where θ and φ are the spherical
angles and S(θ, φ) is the radiated power
in the given directions θ and φ. Here, we are primarily
interested in the forward–backward (FB) ratio, GFB = DF – DB = 10 log 10(SF/SB), where SF and SB are the far-field radiated powers
in the forward (θ = 90°, φ = 90°) and backward
directions (θ = 90°, φ = 270°), respectively.
The FB ratio, GFB, allows a rough assessment
of the directionality of the antennas. In our case, it reaches about
−21 dB at λ1 = 664 nm and nearly 20 dB at
λ2 = 758 nm (see the green solid line in Figure 2b). Notice that positive
(negative) GFB means that forward (backward)
emission dominates. Figure 2a,b further shows that the spectral positions of extreme GFB (at λ1 = 664 nm and λ2 = 758 nm) are very close to those of the two lower-energy
subradiant modes (i.e., λ = 672 and 746 nm).

arrows in the particles represent the EDs, and the green dashed arrows
inside the gaps represent the MDs. Three-dimensional (3D) radiation
patterns for peak GFB are depicted in
the bottom, at wavelengths λ = 664 and 758 nm.

Because the multilayer MDM nanoantenna may sustain
multipole resonances,30 it is essential
to identify the multipolar moment
contributions to the far-field at the resonant wavelength (i.e., λ1 = 664 nm and λ2 = 758 nm). The radiated
power of the electric and magnetic multipoles can be calculated by
the induced volume current density j(r)
inside the nanostructure.38 As expected,
the contributions from the induced ED and MD are significantly larger
than those of the magnetic quadrupole (MQ) and electric quadrupole
(EQ; see Figure S2). Therefore, it is reasonable
to neglect the higher-order multipole moments that have negligible
effects on the radiative decay rate and the radiation pattern.

Figure 2c shows
the radiated powers, PED (violet solid
line) and PMD (pink solid line), of the
induced dipole moments p and m. It is seen
that PMD maximizes at λ = 672 and
746 nm, whereas a relatively large PED covers nearly the entire visible spectrum. The broad PED spectrum indicates that the ED resonance has a low
quality factor. The ED resonance position is at about λ = 621
nm, identified from the scattering spectrum by plane-wave excitation
(see Figure S1). To gain further insight
into the resonant dipole modes, we plot the near fields (Ey or Hz) for the three
peak wavelengths in Figure 2d–f. Careful examination of the Ey distribution shows that the first peak at λ = 621
nm corresponds to an electric resonance in which the LSPRs on the
three plasmonic strips oscillate in-phase (see Figure 2d). Figure 2e,f shows the Hz distribution
in the nanoantenna for the two magnetic resonances at λ = 672
and 746 nm, respectively. It is evident that the magnetic fields are
mainly localized and enhanced inside the left and right dielectric
gaps, respectively. The electric fields over the left two (right two)
strips oscillate out of phase at λ = 672 nm (λ = 746 nm),
which forms strong circulating displacement currents in the left (right)
dielectric gap, highlighting strong cavity magnetic resonance modes
(for details, see Figure S3). As a result,
it is reasonable to assume the induced ED to be oriented along the
emitter polarization direction (i.e., y axis) and
the MD to be oriented along the z direction. A corresponding
three-layer metal–dielectric strip nanoantenna with similar
parameters can support one ED and one MD, giving rise to highly directional
emission at only one specific wavelength (see Figure S4).

Dipole Interaction Model
To qualitatively
understand
the roles of the two kinds of dipoles in achieving the dual-band unidirectional
emission control, a schematic figure of the dipolar interference is
sketched in Figure 2g. The hybridization occurs between a strip monomer and a strip dimer.
When the monomer and the dimer are coupled strongly to each other,
three hybridization cases can be characterized by one ED (py) and two MDs (mz(1) and mz(2)). The solid arrows in the particles
represent the EDs, and the green dashed arrows inside the gaps represent
the MDs. For excitation by a dipole source at the proper position
and polarization, the excitation spectra of py and mz overlap partially, which enables
the dual-wavelength unidirectional emission, as reflected by the GFB spectrum. The 3D radiation power pattern
for the dip of GFB at λ1 = 664 nm also is depicted in Figure 2g, showing an almost complete cancellation of the radiation
toward the right-half space (+x direction) and a
predominated emission to the left-half space (−x direction). In sharp contrast, for the low-energy peak of GFB at λ2 = 758 nm, the nanoantenna–dipole
source coupling system emits almost completely toward the +x direction. For a three-layer MDM strip nanoantenna with
similar geometry and materials (i.e., the parameters are the same
as in Figure 2), the
spectral position of GFB matches precisely
with the spectral position of the MD resonance (see Figure S4b,c). For the five-layer MDM nanoantenna, the spectral
positions of extreme GFB values slightly
deviate from the resonance wavelengths of the corresponding two MDs.
This deviation is partially due to the coupling effect (although weak)
between the two magnetic cavity modes. Moreover, in this configuration,
the nanoantenna ED and MD are significantly larger than the active
dipole source because of the strong LSPR. As such, the total system’s
far field can be expanded into a multipolar series that takes into
account only the first two leading terms (i.e., ED and MD). With dipole
moments p and m, the antenna’s far
field reads19 2  where k is the wave vector, n = k/|k| is the unit vector in
the emission direction, and r is the coordinate vector.
According to eq 2, zero
forward or backward scattering requires the following: (1) the two
dipoles (ED and MD) to be orthogonal to each other; (2) the radiated
powers to be nearly identical, and (3) the phase difference Δφ
= φp – φm = 0 (forward scattering) or Δφ = ±π
(backward scattering), where φp and
φm are the relative phases of the induced p and m in the nanoantenna. In our case, when
Δφ = φp – φm ≈ 0 is fulfilled (i.e., the first Kerker
condition), most emission is directed to the right-half space (+x direction). Likewise, when Δφ = φp – φm ≈
±π (i.e., the second Kerker condition), the emission dominates
in the left-half space (−x direction).

In our system, with comparable amplitudes (see the solid curves in Figure 2c) and relatively
small phase difference, Δφ = 0.13π, of the induced py and mz(2) at λ
= 758 nm (see the green dashed curve in Figure 2c), the first Kerker condition is approximately
fulfilled. Similarly, the second Kerker condition is nearly met at
λ = 664 nm with Δφ = 0.94π. We can have Δφ
≈ ±π and Δφ ≈ 0 in more than
one position. However, highly unidirectional emission does not happen,
as seen in the spectra of GFB, because
the radiated power of ED is much larger than that of MD at those spectral
positions. Furthermore, Δφ is sensitive to the active
dipole position. As a result, the sign of the extreme value of GFB strongly depends on the local source position
(see Figure S5).

Next, to demonstrate
the mechanism of directional emission more
clearly, we reconstruct the two-dimensional (2D) radiation patterns
using an ED and MD interference model (D-M model). The induced ED py and MD mz are
calculated numerically as py = 6.74 e0.45πi × 10–17 C m (2.48 e0.55πi ×
10–17 C m) and mz =
18.39 e–0.49πi × 10–9 A m2 (7.84 e0.42πi × 10–9 A m2) for λ1 = 664 nm (λ2 = 758 nm). Then, eq 2 is used to calculate the far-field and the radiation patterns. The
results from the full FEM calculation and the D-M model are compared
in Figure 3a–d.
The results are in good agreement, and the slight differences are
attributed to negligible contributions from the higher-order multipoles,
which are not accounted for in the D-M model.

patterns in the xz plane calculated by the FEM (solid
curves) and the D–M model

model (dashed curves) for λ = 664 nm. (c, d) Radiation patterns
in the xz and xy planes calculated
by the FEM (solid curves) and the D–M model (dashed curves)
for λ = 758 nm, respectively.

On the basis of eq 2, the complementary FB directionality, KFB, can be defined as follows19 3  As shown in Figure 2b, the spectrum of KFB (red solid curve) matches overall, but it is slightly red-shifted,
with respect to that of GFB (black solid
curve). This deviation is ascribed partially to the dissipation in
the nanoantenna structure. Figure 2b also shows that the extreme KFB wavelength matches the spectral positions where Δφ
= 0.03π and 0.96π. Similar results arise in plasmonic
systems with ED and EQ interference.19

Theoretical Analysis of Cavity Resonances
On the basis
of the previous analysis, it becomes possible to control the peak
positions of GFB by tuning the magnetic
resonances. The magnetic cavity modes in the MDM structure are considered
to result from the gap plasmonic waves.31 On the basis of the Fabry–Pérot (FP) model, the resonant
condition of the cavity modes in our structure is approximately represented
as follows39,40 4  where kgsp denotes
the gap surface plasmon polariton (SPP) propagation constant, p and q are the quantum numbers in the y and z directions (p =
1 and q = 0 in our case). Here, Leff is the effective side length of this resonator, which
accounts for the fringe field effect that may be considered as a phase
shift in the gap plasmonic wave upon reflection at the cavity edges.
Similarly, in the circular plasmonic patch nanoantennas,30,31 we can replace Leff with l + d in eq 4 as the first-order approximation, where d is the gap thickness. The peak position of GFB for three-layer MDM strip nanoantennas can be approximated
by eq 4 directly (see Figure S6). The five-layer MDM structure can
be viewed effectively as two intertwined three-layer MDM nanoantennas.
In our case, the fringe field effect is expected to be different in
the two dielectric layers (see Figure S7) and the phase shift increases as the gap thickness increases.41 Thus, Leff = l + d1 (or Leff = l + d2) is considered to be the effective side length of the FP resonator
at dielectric layer d1 (or d2).42Figure 4a shows the numerically calculated resonance
frequencies of the MD cavity modes versus Leff = l + d1 (or Leff = l + d2). Figure 4b shows the GFB spectrum with the extreme
positions labeled by squares and circles. The
data were collected for different geometry lengths, l. As the side length increases from l = 100 to 250
nm, the MD resonances are red-shifted and the peak positions of GFB experience the same varying trend. For a
larger size (e.g., l = 200–250 nm), higher-order
multipole components contribute significantly to the scattered field,
leading to enhanced directionality at high frequency (see the green
and orange curves in Figure 4b).

Figure 4 (a) Magnetic resonant frequencies (symbols) vs π/(l + d1) or π/(l + d2) for different side lengths l of the nanoantenna, superimposed with the dispersion relation
(solid curve) of the corresponding 2D multilayer structure. (b) GFB spectra for different side lengths l of the nanoantenna. The rest of the parameters are the
same as in Figure 2.

According to eq 4,
the resonant frequency and the size of the metal–dielectric
resonator are correlated with kgsp (ω),
which can be examined by the transfer matrix
method for the corresponding 2D multilayer system.30,31,43,44Figure 4a shows that the peak positions
of extreme GFB approximately fall on the
dispersion relation, kgap (ω) (i.e.,
the black solid curves). The dispersion has several branches, and
the lowest two are in accordance with the symmetric plasmonic gap
modes in the two gap layers of thicknesses d1 and d2, respectively. More interestingly,
it is confirmed that all of the magnetic modes excited in the same
dielectric layer fall on the same dispersion branch, justifying the
validity of the 2D analysis in eq 4. Figure 4 clearly shows that the peak positions of GFB can be approximately predicted by eq 4, by properly setting the effective side length Leff.

Switching of Unidirectional Emission
Because the dispersion
relation, kgsp (ω), depends on a
bunch of parameters, including the material dielectric function (n1 and n2) and the
geometry (e.g., l, t, d1, and d2), the hybridized
MDs certainly not only depend on l but also depend
on the gap thickness and refractive index of the dielectric spacer.45 As a result, the directionality of GFB can be remarkably controlled by d1, d2, n1, and n2.

First, we examine the
case of gradual variation of the refractive index, n2, from 1 to 1.5, while keeping the rest of the parameters
the same as in Figure 2. The directionality of GFB, the radiated
power of ED and MD, and their relative phase difference Δφ
are shown in Figure 5a–r. As seen in the first column of Figure 5, the spectral position of extreme GFB experiences a slight redshift and the peak
amplitude is gradually reduced when n2 changes from 1 to 1.2. Simultaneously, the amplitude of MD is gradually
reduced because of the weak interactions of the three metallic particles,
whereas the amplitude of ED remains almost unchanged (see the second
column of Figure 5).
As a result, the mismatch between the ED and MD amplitudes increases,
leading to decreased GFB. Because the
reduction is rather gradual, it allows for certain flexibility in
the choice of parameters. More interestingly, when the refractive
index approaches n2 = 1.3, the signs of
the two extreme GFB values become negative,
indicating that Δφ values at both these two wavelengths
are close to π (see Figure 5i). Furthermore, when n2 increases to 1.4 (see Figure 5m–o), the high-energy peak of GFB disappears because the MD becomes off-resonance and its
amplitude is almost extinguished. Further increasing n2 to 1.5, it is seen that the signs of peak GFB at the short wavelength (λ = 701 nm) and the
long wavelength (λ = 804 nm) flip, changing from negative (positive)
to positive (negative), compared to those in the initial case of n2 = 1 (the first row of Figure 5).

of GFB [see panels (a), (d), (g), (j),
(m), and (p)], amplitude

and (q)], and relative phase difference of py and mz [see panels (c), (f), (i), (l),
(o), and (r)] for various refractive indices of the spacer from n2 = 1 to 1.5. (s, t) Normalized radiation patterns
in the xy plane for the peak wavelengths when n2 varies; the rest of the parameters remain
the same as in Figure 2c.

To demonstrate the unidirectional
emission switching more clearly,
the normalized 2D radiation patterns at the xy plane
for different n2 values at the two peaks
of GFB (i.e., the shorter and longer wavelengths
labeled λ1 and λ2) are plotted in Figure 5s,t, respectively.
It is seen that the refractive index of the dielectric spacer plays
a crucial role in determining the directionality of the nanoantenna.
One can switch the emission between the forward (backward) and backward
(forward) directions with a single element for two independent wavelengths.
A similar behavior can be observed by properly changing the thickness
of the dielectric spacer (see Figure S8). The nature of this switching can be attributed to differences
in the phase retardation effect on the left two (or right two) metal
strips when excited by the dipole source, for systems characterized
by different parameters (e.g., refractive index and thickness of the
dielectric spacer). Such a phase retardation variation can be seen
more clearly through careful examination of the near field. For example,
|Hz| is localized mainly inside the left
and right dielectric gaps at the shorter and longer wavelengths, respectively,
for the two MD resonances in the case of n2 = 1.5, which is opposite to the situation of n2 = 1, as shown in Figure 2e,f.

The switching between forward (backward)
and backward (forward)
directionalities when n2 = 1 is changed
to n2 = 1.5 is predicted by eq 4. Figure 6 shows that by properly setting the effective
length, Leff, which depends on the excitation
of mz(1) (Leff = l + d1) or mz(2) (Leff = l + d2), the resonant frequencies of MDs for n2 = 1 (red symbols) and n2 = 1.5 (green symbols) approximately fall on the corresponding
dispersion curves of the gap SPPs (see the red curve for n2 = 1 and the green curve for n2 = 1.5). Furthermore, the positive peak of GFB (circles) falls on the low-energy branch for n2 = 1 but on the high-energy branch for n2 = 1.5. Correspondingly, the negative peak (dip) of GFB (triangles) falls on the high-energy branch
for n2 = 1 and on the low-energy branch
for n2 = 1.5. Moreover, we also examined
the gradual variation of the refractive index, n1, from 1 to 1.5 (see Figure S9a), while keeping the rest of the parameters the same as those in Figure 2. The results show
that the positive GFB peak position is
gradually red-shifted and the negative positions remain almost unchanged
because the high-energy dispersion branch is relatively more insensitive
to n1 (see Figure S9b). We also study the forward and backward scattering directionalities
of GFB for different emitter polarizations
(see Figure S10). The peaks of GFB have a spectral shift, whereas peak signs
do not change at the short or long wavelength for different emitter
orientations. This phenomenon can be explained by the Kerker condition,
and color-switching can be achieved by different emitter polarizations.
To this end, we have demonstrated the switching between forward (backward)
and backward (forward) directionalities by properly tuning one parameter
(thickness or refractive index of the dielectric layer), as shown
in Figure 5 (also see Figure S8). However, the operating wavelengths
cannot be fixed in these schemes. In view of the dispersion band dependence
on both the geometry and material, we attempt to utilize gap thicknesses d1 and d2 simultaneously
(or n1 and n2) to obtain the emission direction switching for two fixed wavelengths. Figure 7a shows the effects
of gap thicknesses d1 and d2 on GFB. Four cases of d1 = 10 nm (d2 =
20 nm), d1 = 15 nm (d2 = 25 nm), d1 = 25 nm (d2 = 35 nm), and d1 = 50 nm (d2 = 60 nm) are shown. It is
evident that by varying the gap thickness, d1 or d2, the emission directionality
can be altered remarkably. Because an increase in d1 and d2 leads to weaker near-field
couplings (∼1/d3) of the LSPRs,46 a blueshift for both the forward and backward
directionalities is observed. This blue-shifting saturates for further
increased gap thickness because the near-field interactions may diminish
at a sufficiently large separation. In a similar strategy, a noticeable
redshift can be seen in Figure 7b when we increase n1 or n2 from 1 to 1.5 (i.e., silicon dioxide). For
all such cases, several combinations of d1 (d2) and n1 (n2) exist that make it possible to
tune the directional emission between the forward (backward) and backward
(forward) directionalities at fixed wavelengths. For example, we can
first change n2 to 1.5 while retaining n1 = 1 to switch the sign of GFB at the peak positions and then we can properly increase d1 and d2 to compensate
the wavelength shift.

The rest
of the parameters remain the same as in Figure 2c.

Figure 7 Directionality of GFB tuned by the
gap layer thickness and the refractive index. (a) Effects of thicknesses d1 and d2. (b) Effects
of refractive indices n1 and n2.

To better illustrate
this point, we carefully adjust and eventually
set d1 = 47 nm, d2 = 25 nm, n1 = 1.26, and n2 = 1.32 and compare this nanoantenna to the
one studied in Figure 2a. Figure 8 shows
that the lowest two dispersion branches of these two cases coincide.
In a similar strategy as shown in Figure 6, it is easy to demonstrate the exchange
between forward (backward) and backward (forward) directionalities
at a fixed wavelength. Figure 9a shows the spectrum of GFB for
this case (see the green dotted line) compared to that for the case
of d1 = 15 nm, d2 = 25 nm, n1 = n2 = 1 (see the black dotted line). The forward-to-backward
emission direction exchange at the same wavelength, λ = 758
nm (λ = 664 nm), is seen clearly. The normalized radiation pattern
in the xy plane for both antennas is shown in Figure 9b. According to these
patterns, for properly selected parameters d1 = 15 nm, d2 = 25 nm, n1 = 1, and n2 =
1, at λ = 664 nm, the dipole source emission is highly directed
(GFB = −21 dB) toward the −x direction (the solid line in Figure 9b). However, in a dramatic contrast, at the
wavelength of λ = 758 nm, the emission is highly directed (GFB = +20 dB) toward the +x direction
(the solid line in Figure 9c). Conversely, for properly set parameters d1 = 47 nm, d2 = 25 nm, n1 = 1.26, and n2 = 1.32, an orange-color emission is directed toward the +x direction (the dashed line in Figure 9b) at λ = 664 nm and a red-color emission
is directed toward the −x direction at λ
= 758 nm (the dashed line in Figure 9c). This unambiguously demonstrates the color-switching
behavior as schematically shown in Figure 1b,c. In this way, the proposed nanoantenna
acts like a two-channel optical demultiplexer. Therefore, it shows
great potential for applications in integrated optical circuits, nano-optics,
and nanophotonics.

with d1 = 15 nm, d2 =
25 nm, n1 = 1, and n2 = 1 and d1 = 47 nm, d2 = 25 nm, n1 = 1.26, and n2 = 1.32.

two cases shown in (a).

It is important to study the directivity when the antenna
is placed
on a dielectric substrate because this is the typical experimental
realization for optical antennas.29,47 The emitter–antenna
system depicted in Figure 2 is placed on a glass substrate (ε = 2.25; see Figure 10a). The positive
and negative directivity peaks also show up at 758 and 664 nm because
the electromagnetic fields are localized mostly inside the antenna. Figure 10b,c shows the resulting
angular far-field directionality for the two wavelengths. The emission
is directed mainly toward the substrate47 and is scattered into the +x (−x) direction at λ = 758 nm (λ = 664 nm). Thus, the present
antenna can be fabricated to experimentally realize the bidirectional
color routing.

Conclusions
We design and numerically demonstrate a
dual-band ultracompact
plasmonic nanoantenna with controllable high unidirectionality for
a nearby dipole emitter. The nanoantenna supports two spectrally tunable
MD modes with a strength that is comparable to that of the overall
ED resonance. Superior forward and backward radiation patterns are
achieved, with forward-to-backward directionality reaching +20 and
−21 dB, respectively. Analyses based on a simple dipole model
are performed, and the reconstructed radiation patterns agree well
with the full-wave simulation results. Furthermore, we show that the
spectrum of the extreme directionality can be approximated by the
SPP dispersion in the corresponding 2D metal–dielectric multilayered
structure and can demonstrate the possibility of color-switching.
Our findings significantly broaden the versatility of plasmonic devices,
and we envision the possible practical implementations in meta-materials,
photon couplers, and chemo- or biosensors.

Methods
Transfer Matrix
Method
First, we extend the radius
to infinity (i.e., l → ∞) and treat
the system as a seven-layer film system with air on the top and at
the bottom, consisting of alternating three homogeneous
metallic layers and two homogeneous dielectric layers. For TM polarization,
the transfer matrix that relates electric fields across the interface
from layer i to j reads 5  where ηij = kx,jεi/kx,iεi; here, εi is the permittivity in material i and kx,i is the x-component of the wave vector in material i and can be written as , where k0 and k∥ are the free space wave vector and
the in-plane propagation constant, respectively. The field at x + Δx can relate to this at position x in material j by matrix ϕj 6  Then, the total transfer
matrix to describe
the nine-layer structure can be written as M = D12ϕ2D23ϕ3D34ϕ4D45ϕ5D56ϕ6D67 and the reflection coefficient as rc = M2,1/M1,1. When the reflection coefficient, rc, is undefined (i.e., M1,1 = 0),
it corresponds to the eigenmodes of the structure, and then, the gap
plasmon dispersion relation (kgsp) of
this nanostructure can be obtained.

FEM Modeling
The
radiative decay rate spectrum and
the multipole analysis for the multilayered antenna were conducted
using the radio frequency module of commercial FEM software COMSOL
Multiphysics. The ED emitter was modeled as an electric current dipole
moment with amplitude 1/(2πf), where f is the frequency. To absorb light scattered in all directions,
the entire simulation space was then surrounded by a perfectly matched
layer (PML), whose thickness equals λmax/2, where
λmax is the longest wavelength in the frequency domain
study. Scattering boundary conditions were imposed on PML boundaries
to preclude reflections. Far-field calculations were performed on
a sufficiently large spherical surface (radius, R = 1 m) to ensure the accuracy of the near-field to far-field transformation.
Test runs with different mesh sizes and domain sizes were conducted
until convergence was reached.

DDA Method
DDSCAT
7.1 was chosen for calculating the
radiative decay rate using the DDA method. The total system contains
around 1.4 × 107 dipoles, and test runs with different
dipoles were also conducted until convergence was reached.
