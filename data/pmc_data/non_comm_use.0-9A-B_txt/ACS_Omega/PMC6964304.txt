This work describes the design and fabrication of free-standing
carbon nanotube-palladium (CNT-Pd) composite sheets for hydrogen gas
sensing. The CNT-Pd composites were made by electroplating palladium
onto a solvent-densified and oxygen plasma-treated CNT sheet. The
latter was prepared using high purity CNTs drawn from a dense, vertically
aligned array grown by chemical vapor deposition on silicon substrates.
The CNT-Pd sheets were characterized by energy-dispersive spectroscopy,
scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction. The amount of
palladium in the composite was 16.5 wt % as measured via thermogravimetric
analysis. Thin strips of the CNT-Pd sheets were assembled as chemiresistor
sensors and tested for hydrogen gas detection. The sensors demonstrated
a limit of detection of 0.1 mol % and displayed signal reversibility
without the need for oxygen removal or heat treatment. A decrease
in signal reversibility was observed after multiple exposure cycles;
however, redensification with ethanol significantly restored the original
reversibility. The sensor showed the Freundlich adsorption isotherm
behavior when exposed to hydrogen. The material’s potential
application toward a wearable, flexible sensor was demonstrated by
integrating the chemiresistor onto a fabric material using hot-press
processing and testing the composite for hydrogen sensitivity.

1 Introduction
Recent decades have seen
a diversification in the utilization of
hydrogen gas used for industrial and research applications. Hydrogen
is employed as a fuel source in both space exploration and fuel cells
and is also currently being investigated for use in medical applications.1,2 Additionally, it is used for heat treatment of metals, the refinement
of heavy crude oil,3 and in the semiconductor
processing technologies. Hydrogen can also be produced as a byproduct
of nuclear power plants4 and coal gasification.5 Recent advances in hydrogen-storage capabilities
also increase the potential of hydrogen as an environmentally friendly
alternative to fossil fuels for cars and trucks.6−9 One important issue, however,
is that hydrogen poses a serious safety hazard in these scenarios
because of its odorlessness, colorlessness, and flammability (4 vol
% lower explosive limit and 75 vol % upper explosive limit).10 Therefore, developing versatile hydrogen sensors
is essential, especially sensors for personal use.

Palladium
has frequently been used for sensing hydrogen via changes
in its mechanical and electrical properties because of its ability
to absorb vast quantities of hydrogen gas. The interstitial spacing
of the Pd crystal structure, as well as the presence of two empty
electron d-orbitals, allows for both the dissociation of molecular
hydrogen into atomic hydrogen and its absorption into palladium.11−13

Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have received wide attention for a
variety
of applications because of their remarkable properties since first
reported by Radushkevich14 and Iijima.15 In particular, CNTs have been found to have
high electrical and thermal conductivity, strong mechanical properties,16,17 and the ability to be functionalized covalently18−21 and noncovalently.22−26 Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has been proven to be effective
at growing arrays of vertically aligned CNTs that allow for a property
called “spinnability”, which facilitates easy macro-assembly
of CNTs into either sheets or threads in a simple and scalable fashion.27−29 The CNTs from these “spinnable” arrays are easier
to process, adapt for larger scale production, and are essentially
free of residual catalyst materials.30

CNTs have also been explored for potential use in gas-sensing applications.31−34 One notable sensor application of CNTs is the chemiresistor, a conducting
element that changes its electrical resistance as it is exposed to
a target gas. CNTs that have not been chemically or physically functionalized
(pristine CNTs) are electrochemically active because of the presence
of π electrons surrounding the carbon backbone. Electron-withdrawing
molecules can attract these π electrons away from the CNT conductive
band, altering the CNT electrical conductivity.35 However, this electrochemical activity of pristine CNTs
is weak for many gaseous analytes making it difficult to distinguish
between different electrochemically active gases.36−38 Therefore,
many researchers have opted to use CNTs as a scaffold for functionalization
with more strongly electrochemically active materials, such as palladium
(CNT-Pd), to enhance their hydrogen-sensing capabilities.39−45 However, many of these sensors have practical disadvantages, such
as requiring oxygen to reverse or recuperate the sensor after hydrogen
gas exposure and also a lack of durability and mechanical flexibility.

Spinnable CNT arrays have been used to design and fabricate hydrogen
sensors. The ease of obtaining CNTs from spinnable arrays into useful
sensor structures gives them an advantage over other similar materials
such as ZnO nanotubes46,47 which must be grown directly
on a sensor structure or applied via other means. Yan et al.44 reported a sensor consisting of 1–5 layers
of CNT ribbon capable of reversibly detecting hydrogen concentrations
over a range of 0.5–10% and achieving response times under
200 s. In another paper, continuing their work, Yan et al.48 adhered 2–6 layers of CNTs from a spinnable
array to Au electrodes and used e-beam evaporation to deposit palladium
on the CNTs. The sensor was able to detect hydrogen over a range of
0.5–10%. Kim et al.49 used two layers
of CNT ribbon on Au/Cr electrodes and achieved a low detection range
of 0.0002% (2 ppm)–0.1% (1000 ppm) with response times of above
6 min at 2 ppm to less than a minute for 1000 ppm. Han et al.50 tested a CNT-Pd-based sensor over a hydrogen
concentration range of 3–35%. The sensor from this group was
fabricated by drawing from spinnable CNT arrays and depositing several
layers of CNT ribbon onto a polymer substrate. A key similarity in
the references mentioned previously is that very thin CNT sheets,
with a thickness less than a micron, have been used. This precludes
them from performing as a free-standing structure and requires a substrate
support. The primary motivation for this work was to design and create
hydrogen sensors based on CNT sheets with an appreciable thickness
that allowed them to perform as free-standing structures.

A
potential way to implement a CNT-based sensor, especially for
personal gas-sensing applications, is by integrating the CNT-Pd sensors
into wearable fabrics. Fabric-integrated sensors provide key advantages
over conventional sensors such as flexibility and ability to be fabricated
in a variety of geometries for personal monitoring. Interest in this
topic has produced a plurality of fabric-integrated sensors for different
analyte gases and a range of methods to integrate the sensing element
into the fabric, including printing,51 embroidery,52 thin-film deposition,53 weaving conductive fibers into a fabric mesh,54,55 and depositing sensing materials directly onto the fabric.56 However, these techniques have revealed drawbacks
that limit their implementation. Printed materials are vulnerable
to mechanical damage, embroidered and woven materials can suffer harm
during their fabric integration, and thin-film materials (i.e., prepared
by sputtering) require a specialized and expensive vacuum environment.
More versatile integration techniques are needed in order to increase
the viability of fabric-integrated sensors.

In this work, a
simple and scalable method that can be conducted
in an ambient environment, involving atmospheric plasma treatment
followed by ethanol densification and electroless and electroplating
Pd deposition, is presented for fabricating free-standing CNT-Pd sheet
composites for use as a chemiresistive hydrogen sensor. The sensor
created in this way maintained its sensing capabilities after being
successfully integrated into a fabric by employing hot-pressing and
polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as an adhesive. The change in electrical resistance
of the obtained composite sheet was found to be reversible for H2 sensing but lost this property after several test cycles
of hydrogen gas exposure. Redensifying the sheet with ethanol significantly
contributed to restoring its reversibility. Scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) was used to study the morphology of the composites. Energy-dispersive
spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were conducted to identify
the components of the composite. In order to determine the metal content
of the composite sample, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was practiced.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials and Equipment
Spinnable
CNT arrays were grown in-house using a previously reported CVD technique.27,30 Oxidized single crystal silicon (CAS no. 7440-21-3, procured from
SQI Inc, semiconductor grade) wafers with a 5 nm buffer layer of alumina
and 1.2 nm double layer of iron (CAS no. 7439-89-6) and cobalt (CAS
no. 7440-48-4) on top were sputtered onto the wafer to act as a catalyst
for CNT growth. The gas mixture utilized during the CVD process consisted
of the following gases, with the purity greater than 4 N and represented
by their partial pressure: 560 mmHg argon (CAS no. 7440-37-1, Wright
Brothers Inc.), 60 mmHg H2 (CAS no. 1333-74-0, Wright Brothers
Inc.), and 140 mmHg ethylene (CAS no. 74-85-1, Gas Innovations). The
hydrocarbon served as a carbon precursor. Simultaneously, water vapor
was added in the gas mixture with a concentration of 900 ppm to accelerate
the growth kinetics of the CNTs. Pressure was kept at a total pressure
of 1 atm and the temperature was maintained at 750 °C. Palladium
chloride (99%) (CAS no. 7647-10-1) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
and used for electroless deposition followed by electrodeposition
on the CNT sheet. Stannous chloride dihydrate (98.2%) (CAS no. 7772-99-8),
used as a reducing agent during electroless deposition, was procured
from Fisher Scientific. Thirty-six normality (18 M) sulfuric acid
(CAS no. 7664-93-9) with a listed purity of 95–98 wt % was
purchased from Fisher Chemical. Fifty micron-thick Buckypaper, consisting
of single-walled CNTs, was employed as a substrate in the CNT sheet-manufacturing
process and was provided by General Nano LLC. A gas mixture of ultrahigh
purity 5 wt % hydrogen in argon and, separately, prepurified argon
as a diluent gas, was purchased from Wright Brothers Inc and used
in the hydrogen-sensitivity experiment. PVA (CAS no. 9002-89-5), utilized
for fabric integration, was a medium molecular weight substance, 86–89%
hydrolyzed, and purchased from Alfa Aesar. The military grade Ripstop
fabric for the CNT sheet integration was a polyester blend provided
by the US Army Research Lab (ARL).

Atmospheric pressure plasma
treatment of the CNTs was performed using a Surfx Technologies Atomflo
instrument, model 400 with an AH-250D circular torch. Raman spectroscopy
was conducted with a Renishaw inVia Raman instrument. Contact angle
measurements were performed with a Kruss Scientific DSA25E Drop Shape
Analyzer. Gas flow rates were controlled using MKS model 1259-C mass
flow controllers (MFC) and an MKS model 247C readout. The experimental
setup for chemiresistive tests was computer-controlled through a custom
LabVIEW program. Conductivity measurements were conducted with a Keithley
220 programmable current source and a Keithley 182 sensitive digital
voltmeter. The gas-sensitivity experiments were carried out in a stainless-steel
cylindrical chamber with a volume of 1853.4 cm3. SEM was
conducted using an FEI SCIOS dual beam instrument for top-down images
and using an FEI Apreo instrument for cross-sectional imaging. The
XRD data were acquired via a Philips X’pert Pro (PW3040/00,
PANalytical). TGA was conducted with a Netzsch STA 409PC. A model
1401 hydraulic press from Tetrahedron Associates, Inc. was used for
CNT-Pd sheet/fabric compression.

2.2 CNT Sheet-Making Procedure and Characterization
CNT sheets were prepared by wrapping 100 layers of CNT ribbon from
a spinnable array around a Buckypaper substrate on a Teflon cylinder,
in a manner similar to previously published work.27,28,57,58 Buckypaper
was used as a substrate because of its flexibility, electrical conductivity,
and the ease with which the CNT sheet could be removed from it after
plasma treatment and Pd deposition. While still on the Teflon cylinder,
the sheet was then exposed for 1 min, at a rate of 3.5 s/rotation,
to 100 W atmospheric helium/oxygen plasma in order to enhance CNT
interaction with the aqueous palladium chloride solution. This has
been achieved because of the increased hydrophilicity of the CNT sheet
after plasma treatment. The sheet was then densified with ethanol
and allowed to dry.

Electroless deposition was utilized in order
to aid with palladium deposition and produce reversible sensor samples
more reliably. The procedure was based on the one described in patent
no. 1,921,941.59 The first step of electroless
deposition of Pd involves exposing a substrate to aqueous solution
of SnCl2 in order to wet the surface with the Sn salt.
Then, the same substrate is exposed to PdCl2, which gets
reduced by SnCl2 to elemental Pd, thus decorating the surface
of the substrate with Pd particles. They later act as sites for electrochemical
deposition of Pd from the PdCl2 electrolyte. In this work,
a 0.22 M solution of SnCl2 was transferred via a pipette
onto the CNT sheet and remained there for 10 s, followed by rinsing
with water. Next, the sample was exposed, in the same manner, to a
0.01 M PdCl2/0.36 M H2SO4 solution
for 10 s, again followed by rinsing with water. This procedure enabled
decoration of the CNT sheet with a network of Pd clusters. Following
the electroless deposition step, a modified “brush”
electrodeposition technique, which is based on the work previously
done by this group,60 is used for the electrodeposition
of palladium. Such a process enhanced a uniform electroplating of
a Pd film on the Pd-decorated CNT sheet. The “brush”
setup is briefly described here. A cotton medical gauze is wrapped
around a flattened end of a steel tube. A Teflon mesh is used to ensure
that the gauze does not adhere to the CNT sheet. The gauze was soaked
in the same 0.01 M PdCl2/0.36 M H2SO4 solution that was used for electroless deposition. A 3 V potential
was applied to deposit Pd film, running for 60 rotations where each
rotation took 3.5 s. The brush electroplating setup is depicted in Figure 1. Once the electroplating
is complete, the CNT-Pd sheet is removed from the Buckypaper substrate.
Deposition of Pd was confirmed with SEM, EDS, and XRD. The amount
of Pd in the CNT sheet was evaluated using TGA.

“brush” approach for electrodeposition
of palladium on the CNT sheet.

2.3 Gas-Sensitivity Testing Setup
Gas-sensitivity
testing was conducted using a custom-made four-probe system for electrical
measurements, integrated with a gas exposure chamber. The chamber
had an inlet valve for the analyte gas (hydrogen) and a bifurcated
outlet line. One line of the outlet went to a vacuum pump and the
other was connected to a bubbler that led to the exhaust.

To
prepare the sample for hydrogen exposure, the chamber went through
a 30 min period of vacuum evacuation followed by 30 min rinsing with
argon flow. This procedure was repeated one more time to secure a
clean environment. The sample was then exposed to various concentrations
of hydrogen gas mixed with argon. The H2 concentration
was set and controlled by MFCs. The flow rate ratios were varied between
a 51 mol % (5 wt %) H2 in Ar and pure Ar acting as a diluent
gas.

2.4 Fabric Integration with the CNT Sheet
CNT-Pd sheet integration into the Ripstop fabric was achieved by
partially soaking the fabric in an aqueous PVA solution. The solution
was mixed in a ratio of 1 g of the polymer to 20 mL of water. The
sheet was laid on top of the soaked fabric area and compressed for
15 min at a temperature of 104 °C and 30.8 metric tons using
a hot press.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Effect of Oxygen Plasma on the CNT Sheet
Raman spectra of the CNT sheet show an increase in the ratio of
the D (1347 cm–1) to G (1582 cm–1) peak (ID/IG) after plasma exposure, as seen in Figure 2a. Our previous work has demonstrated the
effects of oxygen plasma on CNTs.28 Exposure
to high-energy oxygen plasma results in the breaking of graphitic
sp2 bonds (represented by the G peak) and forming of defect
sites that are composed of sp3 bonds (represented by the
D peak). Thus, an increase in the ID/IG ratio represents an increase in sp2 defect sites. The presence of oxygen in the plasma results in the
formation of polar oxygen-based functional groups typical for alcohols
and carboxylic acids at these defect sites. The addition of these
polar functional groups aids in the CNTs’ hydrophilicity as
can be seen when comparing contact angle measurements of pristine
and plasma-functionalized CNT sheets, as demonstrated in Figure 2b–d.

on a pristine sheet, (c) contact angle measurement for a water droplet
on a plasma-functionalized sheet, and (d) bar chart showing the plasma
effect on CNT hydrophilicity quantified by the contact angle.

3.2 SEM and EDS of the CNT-Pd Sheet
The
images as shown in Figure 3a,b represent the presence of nanoparticles that are evenly
distributed throughout the sheet, thus decorating the CNT bundles. Figure 3a illustrates the
side closest to the anode and Figure 3b reveals the side closest to the cathode. Both figures
prove a lack of significant particle size gradient. The spherical
nanoparticles, which represent clusters of Pd atoms, have an average
size of 71.7 nm with a standard deviation of 14.8 nm, based on measurements
taken from Figures 3a,b. A cross-sectional image of the CNT-Pd sheet is shown in Figure 3c. It confirmed that
palladium nanoparticles have been formed throughout the thickness
of the CNT sheet, although the majority of Pd deposition was observed
on the surface exposed directly to the electrolyte. Further cross-sectional
imaging showed the average thickness of the sheet to be 4.5 μm
with a standard deviation of 0.4 μm. The results from the EDS
analysis are presented in Figure 3d. They confirmed that the observed particles are palladium.
Residual tin from the electroless deposition was also detected along
with carbon from the CNT sheet. Oxygen was also present; however,
this was due to the effect of plasma-functionalizing the sheet with
oxygen functional groups.

showing Pd nanoparticles throughout sheet thickness at 35 000×
with the top of the image being the front side of the sheet and the
bottom the backside; and (d) EDS spectrum for the Pd-CNT sheet taken
from a spot illustrated in the Supporting Information.

3.3 XRD of the CNT-Pd Sheet
XRD results
are presented in Figure 4. They show a (002) broad peak at 25.5°, which is attributed
to CNTs [JCPDS card no. 00-085-1638]. Two additional narrow peaks
occur at 40.3 and 47.0°. These two peaks are consistent for the
known spectrum of Pd (JCPDS card no. 00 046 1043). The relatively
thin nature of the CNT-Pd sheet leads to increased noise in the XRD
spectra, which explains why other weaker peaks associated with Pd
are not apparent.

Figure 4 XRD spectrum of the CNT-Pd sheet showing peaks representing
CNT(002),
Pd(111), and Pd(200).

It has been reported that SnO2 does
have hydrogen-sensing
capabilities.61,62 The XRD spectrum of SnO2 has a distinct peak at 51.8° [JCPDS card no. 00-041-1445].
The lack of any peak at this angle as shown in Figure 4, with no other peak nearby to potentially
obscure it, indicates that SnO2 is not present in the sheet
in any significant amount. Thus, it is not feasible to expect that
any hydrogen sensitivity of the fabricated sensor is due to the presence
of SnO2.

3.4 TGA of the CNT-Pd Sheet
The obtained
thermogram as shown in Figure 5 represents a residual mass of 16.5 wt %. This residual mass
constitutes the weight of the palladium component of the CNT-Pd sheet.
Thermogravimetric behavior of CNTs has been well-documented.63−65 For the first derivative measurement, the minimum that occurs at
640 °C represents the main portion of CNTs combusting, while
the slow decline in mass preceding this minimum is the result of the
volatile material, such as water vapor, residual solvent, polymers,
and amorphous carbon being driven off. It is reasonable to believe
that Pd oxidizes during the TGA procedure. However, PdO reverts to
Pd metal and oxygen upon being heated above 900 °C.66 This motivated us to conduct TGA of our samples
up to 1200 °C, where the residual mass is expected to represent
only the Pd metal. This decomposition explains the slight decline
in mass occurring at 815 °C.

in air from 60 to 1200
°C at a rate of 5 °C/min showing both the mass loss and
the first derivative of mass loss.

3.5 Hydrogen-Sensitivity Measurements with the
Fabricated CNT-Pd Sensor
As mentioned earlier, the fabricated
CNT-Pd sensor was tested by exposing it to hydrogen with different
concentrations and simultaneously measuring the electrical resistance
of the device. Three minutes after initial exposure to H2, a rapid decline in the resistance was observed, as shown in Figure 6a. This decline continued
for approximately 25 min, and then a new resistance baseline was established.
From this baseline, the electrical resistance rose to a new level
when exposed to higher concentrations of hydrogen and declined when
the concentration was lowered back to the previously used value. The
initial decline in resistance is due to expansion of the Pd particles
in the sample. During the transition of palladium to palladium hydride,
changes in crystal conformation result in a unit cell expansion of
3.5%, with some dimensional changes of the particles reaching up to
14%.67 With enough palladium present, this
expansion causes palladium particles to form new and improved connections
with other Pd particles and creating a more conductive network with
a favorable electron pathway in the sample. After this initial exposure
to H2 and linking of palladium particles, further particle
expansion pushes CNT bundles in the sheet structure apart, increasing
the overall electrical resistance of the material. This can be clearly
seen at the 10 min mark in Figure 6b, where the resistance begins to increase by 0.86%.
This mechanism is relatively slow as the increase starts to occur
5 min after hydrogen exposure begins. In contrast to the previous
mechanism, the changes in electrical resistance that corresponded
to variation in the hydrogen concentration occurred on the timescale
of seconds, implying a second mechanism based on the surface phenomenon.
Several previous studies have discussed the surface interactions of
palladium hydride with CNTs. When palladium transitions to palladium
hydride, a lowering of the work function occurs,12,68 this results in electrons being more readily transferred to the
CNTs, which has been theorized to fill p-type conductors in the CNT
sheet and therefore increase the electrical resistance of the CNT-Pd
composite.38,69,70

Figure 6 Change
in electrical resistance of the CNT-Pd sheet with time when
exposed to hydrogen: (a) initial exposure, (b) after two hydrogen
exposure cycles, and (c) after six hydrogen exposure cycles.

One feature of the fabricated sensor is that the
electrical resistance
decreases as the hydrogen concentration is lowered, despite there
being no oxygen to remove the hydrogen from palladium. Such a resistance
behavior is illustrated in Figure 6a at the 35, 40, 45, and 65 min marks and in Figure 6b when the H2 concentration is lowered at the 35 min mark. This can be
explained by the thermodynamic properties of the hydrogen-palladium
system. Changes in the partial pressure of hydrogen (i.e., the concentration
of hydrogen in the surroundings) can cause desorption from the palladium
with smaller particles resulting in better desorption capabilities.71−73 If the concentration of hydrogen in the surroundings decreases,
hydrogen will desorb from the palladium in order to re-establish equilibrium.
However, the initial desorption is only partial, with total desorption
taking some time to be achieved. This factor explains the behavior
of the gas sensor presented here, with the concentration of hydrogen
in the gas mixture exerting an influence on the content of H2 in the solid palladium mixture.

After several repeated hydrogen
exposure cycles, however, the property
of the signal reversibility declined, as displayed in Figure 6c. This can be attributed to
the palladium clusters becoming more saturated with hydrogen after
repeated testing. Another mechanism that accounts for this is that
repeated expansion of the Pd particles can result in the CNT structure
being pushed away and partially detached from the particles. This,
in turn, can result in the CNT bundles being less responsive to changes
in the surface behavior brought about by the transition of palladium
to palladium hydride. Using ethanol to redensify the sample helped
to mitigate such an effect, as can be seen in Figure 7. Densification brings the CNT bundle structure
back into close contact with the Pd particles.

Figure 7 CNT sheet resistance
response to 0.3% hydrogen exposure before
and after ethanol redensification. The sheet previously endured seven
hydrogen exposure cycles.

Exposing the CNT-Pd sheet to different concentrations
of hydrogen,
punctuated by periods of flushing argon-only flow, resulted in the
formation of distinct signal peaks. The height of each peak was proportional
to the concentration of hydrogen being used with the sample showing
a distinct response to concentrations as low as 0.1 mol %, which is
illustrated in Figure 8a,b. From these peaks, a calibration curve of percent change in resistance
versus hydrogen concentration is plotted in Figure 8c. This calibration curve obeyed a Freundlich
absorption isotherm fitted with an equation of y =
0.40039(x0.38825) with R2 = 0.98982. Based on this assumption, a linear calibration
line could be obtained by plotting the log of both axes, as shown
in Figure 8d. The equation
for this line was 0.34928x – 0.37999 with R2 = 0.97908. The time needed for the sensor
to reach 90% of its reading signal is known as the response time.
This sensor parameter showed an exponential relation to hydrogen concentration
for our device as demonstrated in Figure 8e. The exception to this was the 163.2 s
response time for 0.1 mol % hydrogen. Concentrations in the range
of 0.6–4.6 mol % showed an average response time of 91.90 s
and higher concentrations of 6.0 mol % and 8.5 mol % revealed a response
time of 184.8 and 306 s, respectively. The relatively high response
time for 0.1 mol % followed by a decline in the response time is expected
and is similar to what has previously been reported.38,42,43,74 However, this work differs from the literature in that there is
an exponential increase in response times at higher concentrations.
A possible explanation for this divergence from the literature is
the thickness of the sheets. Yan et al.44 tested a very thin CNT-Pd sheet of 1–5 layers. They found
that the five-layer sample was the only one to show a distinct increase
in the response time at higher concentrations. In this work, 100 layers
within the sheet with a total thickness of about 4 μm were accumulated
and utilized in order to make a more stable material, so it is plausible
that the increased number of layers would further exacerbate the rise
in response times at higher concentrations.

and 6.0 mol % hydrogen gas, (c) Freundlich calibration curve showing
the change in resistance vs hydrogen concentration, (d) linear calibration

concentration, and (e) response time vs hydrogen.

Ripstop fabric integration conducted as per the
procedure described
earlier was successful, as displayed in Figure 9a. The CNT-Pd sheet remained intact even
after bending (Figure 9b). The mechanical and electrical stability of the sheet was further
demonstrated by subjecting a sample to repeated bending for 350 000
cycles. Upon this test, the electrical resistance of the sheet was
measured and found to have increased by only 1%. A snapshot of the
video illustrating the CNT-Pd sheet going through the bend testing
is shown in Figure S9 of the Supporting Information. The video has been added separately as an MOV video file. The fabric
sensor showed an increase in an electrical resistance of 0.36 Ω
to 0.1 mol % hydrogen 6 min after exposure. As illustrated in Figure 10, the sensor did
not reveal a clear indication of signal reversibility, which was demonstrated
earlier by the nonfabric-integrated sensor. The decline in reversibility
was potentially caused by several factors. The rough and porous surface
of the Ripstop fabric could generate additional noise when measuring
electrical resistance and may restrict the morphological changes of
the palladium crystal structure during the H2 exposure.
PVA infiltration of the CNT-Pd sheet could also result in morphological
restrictions of Pd, and blocking the interfaces between palladium,
hydrogen gas, and the CNT sheet. Further improvement in the fabric-integrated
CNT-Pd sensor using different fabric materials is underway and will
be published later.

There have been recent advances in utilizing spinnable
arrays to
fabricate CNT-Pd materials for chemiresistive hydrogen sensors as
mentioned in Introduction.44,48−50 However, the material described in this work improves
upon the literature in several key areas, the foremost of which is
the lack of a metal current collector for the sensor. The refs (44, 48, 50) have utilized
metal current collectors as an integral part of the sensor. This not
only increases the susceptibility of the sensor to oxidation and degradation
over time but also adds to the weight of the device which makes it
impractical for wearable applications. Furthermore, a metal electrode
decreases sensor flexibility and hinders its integration onto the
fabric. Because the sensor described in this work is free-standing
and utilizes CNTs as the built-in current collector, it can be applied
in a variety of settings, such as fabrics, with relative ease. Samples
consisting of 100 CNT layers were selected for the final assembling
of the CNT-Pd sheet because such a number provided satisfactory balance
between the minimum material used and a stable and handleable substrate
for palladium deposition. As mentioned in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 of this
work, the plasma functionalization and palladium deposition are predominately
surface treatments and therefore may not benefit from additional CNT
layers in the sample. Utilizing additional CNT layers may also be
a detriment to the sensing capabilities, as adding too much CNTs to
the composite might normalize and dominate the electrical conductivity
of the entire sensor, resulting in less electrical current passing
through the palladium-enriched surface layer and therefore the transition
to palladium hydride may be less noticeable. The inherited flexibility
of the sensor reported here is also an improvement over other reported
similar devices in the literature.44,48−50,74,75 The used approach for fabricating the sensor in this work via simple
electrochemical deposition adds to the manufacturing advantages especially
when comparing the manufacturing techniques described in the literature.
Most of the hydrogen sensor fabrication techniques reported in the
public domain include sputtering,40,41,45,76 E-beam evaporation,42,44,46,77 thermal evaporation,45,49 and atomic layer deposition (ALD)46,47 of palladium. These methods require a vacuum environment and complex
and expensive equipment. The advantage of the sensor fabrication method
detailed in this work is that it can be entirely conducted at atmospheric
pressure, making scale-up much more possible. An additional advantage
is the processing time to deposit palladium. Compared with ALD, which
is more time-consuming, the electrochemical method practiced in this
work deposits the necessary amount of palladium in a much quicker
process. Although electrodeposition was also previously used for Pd
deposition,50,78 it is often implemented in a
way that is not amenable to scale-up. This work demonstrates improvement
upon the conventional electrochemical deposition method by allowing
easy scale-up and continuous roll-to-roll processing. Previously reported
sensors have achieved higher sensitivity reaching down to 2 ppm (0.0002
mol %),49 as a result of utilizing an extremely
thin and fragile CNT material, which is not appropriate for free-standing
devices. We believe that this work demonstrated a scalable and inexpensive
method to produce a free-standing and flexible material, sensitive
to hydrogen and capable of integration into fabric structures.

4 Conclusions
This work demonstrates
a scalable process for fabricating a CNT-Pd
sheet used as a fabric-integrated gas sensor. The method can ideally
be used for producing bulk hydrogen-sensing material. The free-standing
Pd-decorated CNT sheet was tested for hydrogen gas sensitivity by
monitoring the change in electrical resistance via a four-probe setup.
It was shown that upon initial exposure to hydrogen, the resistance
of the sheet declines followed by displaying a high sensitivity to
changes in the concentration of hydrogen. The electrical resistance
of the sample increased as the hydrogen concentration increased and
decreased when the hydrogen concentration was lowered. The CNT-Pd
sheet could detect concentrations of hydrogen as low as 0.1 mol %.
After several tests, the reversibility of the sheet signal declined.
Redensification of the sheet with ethanol significantly restored sensor
reversibility. A calibration curve for the CNT-Pd sensor was generated
fitting a Freundlich adsorption isotherm. The sheet was integrated
into a fabric material using a hot-press method and this processing
did not change the sensitivity of the obtained sensor toward hydrogen
exposure. In this case, the fabric-integrated sensor lost the previously
observed reversibility because of the porous nature and rough structure
of the fabric and because of the PVA infiltration into the CNT sheet
structure. Potential future directions for this research entail improvement
of the fabric-integrated sensors using a variety of fabric materials
and interfacing polymers and the detection of other target gases.
