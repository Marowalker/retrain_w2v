The
enhancement of multiphoton emission from a single colloidal
nanocrystal quantum dot (NQD) interacting with a plasmonic nanostructure
was investigated using SiO2-coated silver nanoparticles
(Ag/SiO2) as the plasmonic nanostructure. Using Ag/SiO2 with five different SiO2 shell thicknesses, we
observed modification of the emission behavior depending on the distance
between the NQD and silver nanoparticle (AgNP). The single-photon
emission from a single NQD converted to multiphoton emission with
a shortening of the emission lifetime as the NQD–AgNP distance
decreased, whereas an increase and decrease in the emission intensity
were observed. From the distance-dependent results, we concluded that
the probability of multiphoton emission was increased by the quenching
of the single-exciton state due to energy transfer from the NQD to
the AgNP and that the emission intensity was modified by the enhancement
of the excitation rate and quenching. These results indicate that
the plasmonic nanostructure is very effective in controlling the emission
photon statistics, that is, single- and multi-photon emission and
the emission intensity from the single NQD, which is difficult to
achieve in an NQD alone.

Introduction
Colloidal nanocrystal
quantum dots (NQDs) are dispersible nanoscale
emitters that are of great interest because of their potential applications
in a wide range of optoelectronic devices1−10 and in biosensing.11−13 The emission photon statistics, that is, single-photon
emission and multiphoton emission, from a single NQD is an important
optical property obtained as a result of multiexciton dynamics, which
can be explained as follows. When multiple excitons are simultaneously
generated in a single NQD, multiexciton states (MX), such as the triexciton
state (TX) or biexciton state (BX), are formed, depending on the number
of generated excitons. In the emission process, the excitons decay
from the TX or BX to the single-exciton state (SX) by emitting a single
photon on a picosecond time scale. Then, the remaining single-exciton
decays from the SX to the ground state (GS) by emitting a single photon
on a nanosecond time scale.14 Thus, multiple
photons can be emitted by this cascade emission. The obtained multiphoton
emission can behave as an entangled photon pair, which is important
for quantum information technologies.15 However, when multiple excitons are generated, nonradiative Auger
recombination occurs. The excitons decay nonradiatively from the MX
to the SX.16 Subsequently, the remaining
single-exciton decays from the SX to the GS by emitting a single photon.
Therefore, single-photon emission can be obtained via Auger recombination.17−20 Single-photon emission is also important for quantum information
technologies. Generally, the emission photon statistics of an NQD
are controlled by quantum confinement, which depends on the size,
shape, and atomic composition of the NQDs themselves.

Recently,
control of the photon statistics of NQDs using plasmonic
nanostructures, that is, metallic nanostructures (MNSs), has received
substantial attention. An increase in the probability of multiphoton
emission through the interaction with MNS has been reported using
various NQD–MNS systems.21−37 Two mechanisms have been proposed to explain the increase in multiphoton
emission. One is the enhancement of the multiphoton emission rate
by enhancement of the radiative rate. Because of this enhancement,
a single NQD–MNS can emit multiple photons before the excitons
are annihilated by Auger recombination, that is, the quantum yield
of the MX emission (ΦMX) increases.21−25,27,30−34,36 The other mechanism is the quenching
of the SX by the MNS, that is, a decrease in the quantum yield of
the SX emission (ΦSX) rather than an actual increase
in the ΦMX. This mechanism can be understood as follows:
When the excitons are quenched by the MNS, due to energy or electron
transfer, the quenching of the SX is more efficient than that of the
MX because of the longer lifetime of the SX. Because of the decrease
in ΦSX, the contribution of the MX emission increases.
Consequently, the probability of the MX emission increases.28,37−40 Although these two mechanisms were proposed, the details are not
yet fully understood.

To elucidate the mechanism, a single NQD–MNS
system in which
the spectral overlap and distance are fully controlled is ideal. When
the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) band of the MNS overlaps
the absorption spectrum of the nearby emitter, the excitation rate
of the emitter is enhanced by the electric field of the localized
surface plasmon (LSP) generated on the MNS by incident light. When
the LSPR band overlaps with the emission spectrum of the emitter,
the relaxation process, that is, radiative and nonradiative processes,
of the emitter is enhanced by the dipole–dipole interaction
between the emitter and MNS.41−45 The enhancement factors strongly depend on the distance between
the emitter and MNS. Although the relationship between the change
in photon statistics and spectral overlap has often been discussed
in the literature,22,24,25,31,36,46 few reports have examined the dependence of the change
in photon statistics on distance.31,37 Coating the
MNSs or NQDs with the dielectric material SiO2 is an effective
method for controlling the distance. Numerous studies have reported
the modification of the PL intensity and lifetime of distance-controlled
NQD–MNS systems using a SiO2 shell.31,34,47−50 However, only one report has
examined the relationship between the photon statistics and distance.31 In that work, the distance-dependent emission
photon statistics was measured using SiO2-coated gold nanoparticles
with 5 and 10 nm thick SiO2 shells. To elucidate the mechanism
of modification of the emission behavior of the NQDs using MNSs systematically,
further experimental results using different NQD–MNS systems
are required.

In this work, to elucidate the relationship between
photon statistics
and distance and the mechanism of enhancement of MX emission, SiO2-coated silver (Ag/SiO2) nanoparticles with five
different SiO2 shell thicknesses were used to control the
distance between a single NQD and a silver nanoparticle (AgNP). A
dielectric SiO2 spacer with a controlled thickness provides
a simple means of tuning the interactions between a NQD and AgNP.
To control the distance using the SiO2-shell thickness,
using a single Ag/SiO2 nanoparticle and single NQD and
following a previously reported atomic force microscopy (AFM) manipulation
technique36 is ideal. However, the AFM
manipulation of Ag/SiO2 is hindered by the adsorption of
Ag/SiO2 onto the silicon AFM cantilever. Therefore, the
emission photon statistics of single NQDs interacting with Ag/SiO2 was detected for samples prepared by dispersing NQDs and
Ag/SiO2 nanoparticles on a coverslip by spin-coating.

Results
and Discussion
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images
of Ag/SiO2 nanoparticles with different shell thicknesses
and histograms of
each shell thickness and of the diameter of the core AgNPs are shown
in Figure 1. The core
AgNPs were almost spherical, and the average diameter was 54 ±
2 nm (Figure 1f). The
shell thicknesses were estimated as 5 ± 1, 7 ± 1, 15 ±
1, 24 ± 2, and 38 ± 2 nm from the TEM images. Figure 2 shows the absorption and PL
spectra of the NQDs in toluene (a) and the extinction spectra of the
prepared Ag/SiO2 with different thicknesses (b). The LSPR
band of the Ag/SiO2 nanoparticles was shifted toward a
longer wavelength as the thickness of the SiO2 shell increased,
as expected and previously observed by others.51,52 Because the LSPR band greatly overlaps with the absorption spectrum
of the NQDs, we expected that the excitation rate of the NQD would
be enhanced by the isolated Ag/SiO2 nanoparticles under
405 nm excitation. In addition, the relaxation process of the NQDs
would also be enhanced because of the small overlap of the PL spectrum
with the LSPR band. In an AFM topography image of the prepared sample
(Figure 3), isolated
Ag/SiO2 was visualized, although some of the Ag/SiO2 aggregated. Isolated NQDs were not observed, probably because
the NQDs were close to the Ag/SiO2 as a result of sample
preparation by spin-coating.

Figure 4 shows representative
emission behavior detected from an isolated NQD without Ag/SiO2 (reference) (a–d) and two isolated NQDs with Ag/SiO2 particles with 5 nm thick shells (e–l) exposed to
an excitation laser at 405 nm with an intensity of 710 W/cm2. The number of excitons generated in a single NQD by a single excitation
pulse, ⟨N⟩, was estimated at 0.48 by
taking into account the absorption cross-section of an NQD at 405
nm (1.1 × 10–14 cm2) and the number
of photons in the single excitation pulse. The time trace of the PL
intensity obtained from the reference NQD displayed 200 counts/ms
and characteristic blinking behavior (Figure 4a). The low-intensity level of blinking results
from the quenching of the exciton by the charged state of the NQD.53 The quenching process causes the short decay
component of the PL decay curve. The PL decay curve shown in Figure 4b was fitted using
a two-exponential function, I(t)
= α1 exp(−t/τ1) + α2 exp(−t/τ2), where α and τ represent the normalized
amplitude and PL lifetime, respectively, with lifetimes of τ1 = 0.8 ns (α1 = 60.0%) and τ2 = 18.1 ns (α2 = 40.0%). The short lifetime, τ1 = 0.8 ns, was obtained as a result of quenching of the exciton.
In the photon correlation histogram (Figure 4c), the contribution of the center peak at
a delay time of 0 ns was much lower than that of the other peaks at
delay times of ±100 ns. The second-order correlation function, g(2)(0), provides information about the emission
photon statistics, that is, the probability of single-photon emission
increases when g(2)(0) is close to zero.
In addition, the g(2)(0) value corresponds
to the efficiency of BX emission, ΦBX/ΦSX, at low excitation power (average NQD exciton occupancy
⟨N⟩ ≪ 1).28,33 At a high excitation power, such as that under excitation enhancement
by the electric field of LSP (vide infra), the g(2)(0) value does not correspond to the exact ΦBX/ΦSX. However, the increase in the g(2)(0) value indicates the increase in the probability
of multiphoton emission even at a high excitation power. Therefore,
we use the g(2)(0) value to show the modification
of the photon statistics. The g(2)(0)
values were calculated as 0.09 in Figure 4c, thus indicating that the reference NQD
exhibited single-photon emission.

Figure 4 Time traces of PL intensity (a, e, i), PL decay curves (b, f, j), photon correlation
histograms (c, g, k), and PL spectra (d, h, l) detected from a single
NQD without Ag/SiO2 (reference) (a–d) and from two
single NQDs with Ag/SiO2 with a 5 nm thick shells (e–l).

Representative results for the
two single NQDs with Ag/SiO2 are shown in Figure 4e–l. For the single
NQD shown in Figure 4e–h, the PL intensity increased compared
to that of the reference. The time trace of the PL intensity displayed
480 counts/ms and a reduction of the low-intensity levels (Figure 4e), which has also
been observed in previous reports using AgNP and gold nanoparticles
(AuNPs) as MNSs.21,25,36 The PL decay curve (Figure 4f) was fitted using a three-exponential function, I(t) = α1 exp(−t/τ1) + α2 exp(−t/τ2) + α3 exp(−t/τ3), with three lifetimes of 0.3 ns (85.4%),
1.4 ns (12.7%), and 6.7 ns (1.9%). Because the lifetime of 0.3 ns
was the same as the instrument response function (IRF), the actual
lifetime is probably shorter. Shortening of the lifetime indicated
that the relaxation process of the NQD was modified by Ag/SiO2. In the photon correlation histogram (Figure 4g), the contribution of the center peak increased,
and the g(2)(0) value was estimated as
0.81. This result indicates that the probability of multiphoton emission
increased compared to that of the reference, shown in Figure 4c.

For the single NQD
shown in Figure 4i–l,
the PL intensity decreased to 28 counts/ms
with shortening of the PL lifetime. As the background count under
this experimental condition was 0.3 counts/ms, the single NQD exhibited
a low PL intensity. By fitting the PL decay curve (Figure 4j), three lifetimes were obtained:
0.3 ns (88.1%), 1.1 ns (10.4%), and 4.3 ns (1.4%). From Figure 4k, the g(2)(0) value was estimated as 0.99, thus indicating that the
probability of multiphoton emission was increased, similar to that
for the single NQD shown in Figure 4g. In Figure 4h,l, no clear change in the PL spectra was observed compared
with the reference (Figure 4d). Although the peak wavelengths of the spectra were different
from those of the reference, the difference was within the spectral
distribution of the individual NQDs. Because of the small shift in
the BX and TX emission spectra compared with the SX emission spectrum,14 distinguishing the multiphoton emission spectrum
from the SX emission spectrum at room temperature is difficult.21,36,37 Although we considered the spectral
change with respect to the full width at half-maximum, no significant
change was observed. The observed increase in the g(2)(0) value was attributed to the change in the PL behavior
of the NQD because neither emission nor background scattering from
Ag/SiO2 was observed in Figure 4h,l. The above emission behavior, that is,
a reduction in the blinking and increase in the probability of multiphoton
emission with shortening of the lifetime, was identical to our previous
results,21,25,36,37 and the increase in the probability of multiphoton
emission was also identical to that noted in prior reports.21−25,27−37

The above results are only representative examples obtained
from
single NQDs with and without Ag/SiO2 dispersed on a coverslip.
As we have reported recently, the direct observation of changes in
the emission behavior with the approach of an MNS provides meaningful
results, even if the results are obtained from a few individual NQDs.36,37 However, in single NQD measurements, such as those shown in the
present work, statistical data compiled from all results obtained
from a large number of single NQDs was important to elucidate the
essential emission behavior because the emission behavior of individual
NQDs and NQD–Ag/SiO2 interactions have broad heterogeneity.
For example, in the sample, both aggregated and isolated Ag/SiO2 were observed, as shown in Figure 3. Thus, the NQD–Ag/SiO2 interaction strongly depends on each NQD–Ag/SiO2 pair. In addition, the NQD–Ag/SiO2 distance was
not controlled in the sample. Therefore, we discuss the emission behavior
of single NQDs on the basis of the statistical data in the following
section.

On the basis of the measurements shown in Figure 4, the correlations
between g(2)(0) and the PL intensity and
between g(2)(0) and the average lifetime
detected from single NQDs
are shown in Figures 5 and 6, respectively. The values obtained
from the single NQDs with Ag/SiO2 shown in Figure 4 are marked by blue circles
in Figures 5b and 6b. Each correlation was built from more than 100
single NQD measurements. The decay curves detected from the reference
NQDs were fitted by single- or two-exponential functions, whereas
the decay curves of the single NQDs with Ag/SiO2 were fitted
using two- or three-exponential functions. The average lifetime was
calculated as follows: α1 × τ1 + α2 × τ2 + α3 × τ3. In the case of the reference NQDs, the
PL intensity and average lifetime were distributed in a range of 80–400
counts/ms and 2–23 ns, respectively (Figures 5a and 6a). Nearly
all single NQDs exhibited g(2)(0) values
of less than 0.2, thus indicating that the single NQDs emitted single
photons. These results represent the typical emission behavior of
the single NQDs and were used as a reference. The distributions of
the reference values are indicated by green squares in each correlation.

and with Ag/SiO2, with shell thicknesses of

is based on more than 100 single NQD measurements.

is based on more than 100 single NQD measurements.

The single NQDs with Ag/SiO2 exhibited
large distributions
of the correlations compared with the reference NQD. Among the single
NQDs with Ag/SiO2 with 5 nm thick shells (Figures 5b and 6b), a large number of single NQDs exhibited higher g(2)(0) values than those of the reference. The single
NQDs with higher g(2)(0) values exhibited
large distributions of PL intensity, in the range of 25–600
counts/ms (Figure 5b). However, single NQDs with a higher intensity than that of the
reference (greater than 400 counts/ms) were rare, whereas the number
of single NQDs with a lower intensity than that of the reference increased,
as confirmed by the histogram of PL intensities shown in Figure 5b. As shown in Figure 6b, the single NQDs
with higher g(2)(0) values exhibited shorter
average lifetimes compared to those of the reference, and the average
lifetime decreased with increasing g(2)(0) values. These changes in emission behavior were caused by the
interaction with Ag/SiO2. However, single NQDs with nearly
identical g(2)(0) values and average lifetimes
to those of the reference were observed and are surrounded by green
squares in Figures 5b and 6b. These NQDs probably did not interact
with Ag/SiO2 because these data were obtained from samples
prepared by just dispersing the NQDs and Ag/SiO2 on the
coverslip by spin-coating. The contribution of the NQDs with higher g(2)(0) values and shorter lifetimes decreased
with increasing shell thickness. In the case of the single NQDs
with Ag/SiO2 with 7 nm thick shells, the contribution of
the NQDs with g(2)(0) greater than 0.8
slightly decreased in the g(2)(0) histograms
shown in Figures 5c
and 6c. The contribution of the high g(2)(0) further decreased with increasing shell
thickness, that is, for 15 nm thick shells (Figures 5d and 6d) and 24 nm
thick shells (Figures 5e and 6e), and most of the NQDs exhibited
the same g(2)(0) and average lifetime
as those of the reference for 38 nm thick shells (Figures 5f and 6f). These results clearly indicated that the increase in g(2)(0), that is, the increase in the probability
of multiphoton emission, is strongly dependent on the NQD–AgNP
distance. We are convinced that the emission behaviors shown here
were obtained from single NQDs because of the following reasons: (1)
Using the same concentration of an NQD-dispersed
solution, most NQDs were isolated in the case of the reference sample
(Figures 5a and 6a). (2) In the case of NQDs with Ag/SiO2 with SiO2 shell thicknesses of 24 and 38 nm, most NQDs
exhibited the emission behavior of single NQDs, that is, low g(2)(0) values, as shown in Figures 6e,f and 7e,f, using the same concentration of an NQD-dispersed solution. (3)
We checked the emission behavior by changing the concentration and
measured the emission behavior at quite a low concentration. (4) In Figure 6b, a clear correlation
between the average lifetime and g(2)(0)
value was observed, that is, an NQD with a lower average lifetime
exhibited a higher g(2)(0) value. Actually,
it was reported that this type of correlation was observed even in
the case of the aggregate of NQDs.54 However,
if the correlation shown in Figure 6b was caused by the aggregate, the correlation should
not show distance dependence as shown in Figure 6. Therefore, the correlation was due to the
interaction with Ag/SiO2.

Figure 7 Enhancement factors of the PL intensity
(Ip/Iref)
(a) and g(2)(0) value (g(2)(0)p/g(2)(0)ref) (b) depending
on the shell thickness. The subscripts “p” and “ref”
refer to the NQDs with Ag/SiO2 and reference NQDs, respectively. Ip and g(2)(0)p were estimated as the average values from the NQDs that exhibited
higher g(2)(0) values compared to those
of the reference (outside the green square in Figures 5 and 6). Iref and g(2)(0)ref were estimated as the average (black solid square), minimum (red
solid circle), and maximum (blue solid triangle) values.

Enhancements of the excitation rate and radiative
rate can be considered
to be part of the mechanism of increase of the PL intensity, whereas
the decrease in the PL intensity is caused by enhancement of the nonradiative
rate (quenching). Enhancements of the radiative and nonradiative rates
result in shortening of the lifetime. Therefore, the observed increase
in PL intensity with increasing g(2)(0)
and shortening of the lifetime can be explained by the enhancement
of the radiative rate or by a combination of enhancement of the excitation
rate and nonradiative rate. Similarly, the decrease in PL intensity
with increasing g(2)(0) and shortening
of the lifetime can be explained by the enhancement of the nonradiative
rate. As shown in Figure 2, the LSPR
band of the isolated Ag/SiO2 nanoparticles overlaps with
the absorption and PL spectra of the NQD, although the spectral overlap
between the LSPR and PL bands was smaller than the spectral overlap
of the LSPR band with the absorption band, and the LSPR band was generated
by 405 nm excitation. Thus, the combination of enhancement of the
excitation rate and nonradiative rate is probably a more predominant
mechanism of increase of the PL intensity. The AFM image revealed
aggregation of some of the Ag/SiO2 nanoparticles (Figure 3). The LSPR band
of metallic nanoparticles is known to be red-shifted by interactions
between metallic nanoparticles.55−57 In our sample, such aggregates
should display a red-shifted LSPR band, depending on the condition
of the aggregates, that is, the number of Ag/SiO2 particles
and the distance between the particles. Thus, for these aggregates,
the spectral overlap between the LSPR and PL bands increased, whereas
the spectral overlap between the LSPR and absorption bands decreased.
This effect was probably responsible for the decrease in PL intensity
due to the increase in the enhancement of the nonradiative rate and
the decrease in the enhancement of the excitation rate. Unfortunately,
our instrumental setup did not allow assignment of the LSPR bands
of individual Ag/SiO2 nanoparticles. However, the increase
in the g(2)(0) values was attributed to
the enhancement of the relaxation process. We discuss the distance-dependent
results below to elucidate the mechanism.

Figure 7 shows the
enhancement factors of the PL intensity, Ip/Iref (a), and g(2)(0), g(2)(0)p/g(2)(0)ref (b), for single NQDs with
Ag/SiO2 as a function of shell thickness. The subscripts
p and ref refer to the NQDs with Ag/SiO2 and the reference
NQDs, respectively. Estimation of the enhancement factors was complicated
by the large distribution of the PL intensity and g(2)(0)
values for both the single NQDs with Ag/SiO2 and the reference
NDQs. Thus, Ip and g(2)(0)p were estimated as average values, except
for the NQDs surrounded by the green squares in Figures 5 and 6, to eliminate
the NQDs that did not interact with Ag/SiO2. The following
three combinations of values of Iref and g(2)(0)ref were used: first, the average
of all values, Iref_ave = 216 counts/ms, g(2)(0)ref_ave = 0.095; second, the
minimum value, Iref_min = 77 counts/ms, g(2)(0)ref_min = 0.052; and third,
the maximum value, Iref_max = 400 counts/ms, g(2)(0)ref_max = 0.206. Using these
three combinations, the enhancement factors were estimated. The values
of the enhancement factors for PL intensity shown in Figure 7a increased with decreasing
shell thickness, and the enhancement factor reached the maximum value
at a shell thickness of 7 nm for each of the three combinations of
values. Then, the value decreased for the particles with 5 nm thick
shells. In the case of g(2)(0), the enhancement
factor increased with decreasing shell thickness (Figure 7b). This result indicates that
the probability of multiphoton emission is enhanced with decreasing
distance. To consider the enhancement mechanism, the dependence of
the relative change in the enhancement factor of PL intensity on distance
is important. Novotny et al. have investigated the distance-dependent
PL intensity of a single organic molecule using a AuNP attached to
the end of a pointed optical fiber and have also reported the distance-dependent
enhancement factor of PL intensity, which was similar to our result.58,59 Using theoretical analysis, Novotny et al. clearly demonstrated
that the change in the PL intensity as a function of distance can
be interpreted as arising from a combination of enhancement of the
excitation rate by the LSP of the AuNP and quenching of the PL by
resonance energy transfer from the single molecule to the AuNP.59 These reports support the interpretation of
our results primarily by the same mechanism, that is, a combination
of enhancement of the excitation rate and quenching. Both the enhancement
of the excitation rate and quenching increase with decreasing distance.
As a result, enhancement of the PL intensity reaches a maximal value
and then decreases at shorter distances. Enhancement of the radiative
rate is a possible mechanism for the increase in the PL intensity.
An increase in the PL intensity due to enhancement of the radiative
rate has been observed previously.36 However,
in the case of enhancement of the radiative rate, the PL intensity
should increase with decreasing distance, even at 5 nm. Therefore,
our results in this work can be interpreted as arising from a combination
of enhancement of the excitation rate and nonradiative rate. Because
of this enhancement of the nonradiative rate, that is, the decrease
in ΦSX by Ag/SiO2 as the proposed mechanism,
the probability of multiphoton emission increased. Because the efficiency
of quenching increases with decreasing distance, the g(2)(0) values increased with decreasing distance.

To confirm the influence of excitation rate enhancement by Ag/SiO2 and, in particular, to obtain distance-dependent electric
field enhancement, a numerical simulation of Ag/SiO2 particles
with different shell thicknesses was conducted (details in the Supporting Information (SI)).60,61 The diameter of the AgNP was fixed as 54 nm, which was estimated
as an average value from the TEM observation, and the shell thickness
was varied to be 5, 7, 15, 24, and 38 nm. Figure 8a shows the distribution of the electric
field enhancement of a Ag/SiO2 particle with a 15 nm thick
shell, as an example, obtained by the simulation for illumination
at a wavelength similar to that of the excitation laser (405 nm) with
the z-direction of the electric field. Electric field enhancement
was defined as I = |E|2/|E0|2, where E and E0 are the electric field intensity
on Ag/SiO2 and the light source, respectively. Field enhancement
can be observed at the surface of the SiO2 shell. Figure 8b shows the electric
filed enhancement of 405 nm light at the surface of an SiO2 shell with different thicknesses. The field enhancement decreased
with increasing shell thickness, and the values at 24 and 34 nm were
quite low (7.4 at 24 nm and 0.2 at 34 nm), thus indicating that field
enhancement cannot be expected at 34 nm. This result is in good agreement
with the experimental results shown in Figures 5 and 7, in which the
PL intensity was not modified for the shell thickness of 38 nm.

Conclusions
In this work, we observed modification of the
emission behavior
depending on the distance between NQDs and AgNPs using Ag/SiO2 nanoparticles with different SiO2 thicknesses
to elucidate the mechanism of modification of the emission photon
statistics. To eliminate the heterogeneity of each single NQD–Ag/SiO2, statistical results compiled from more than 100 single NQD
measurements were used. The probability of multiphoton emission increased
with decreasing lifetime as the distance decreased. In addition, the
PL intensity increased and then decreased with decreasing distance.
We determined that the modification of the emission behavior was primarily
caused by the combination of excitation rate enhancement and nonradiative
rate enhancement (quenching). Thus, the PL intensity was increased
because of the excitation rate enhancement induced by the LSP of the
AgNPs and the probability of multiphoton emission was increased by
the quenching of SX induced by the resonance energy transfer from
the NQD to the AgNP. Numerical calculation of the Ag/SiO2 supported the excitation rate enhancement. In fact, the PL intensity
did not increase, as expected from the numerical calculation, because
of the quenching of SX.

As results, the mechanism of modification
of the emission behavior
in this work was similar to that in the previous report, in which
a silver-coated AFM tip was used as the plasmonic nanostructure.37 Although the obtained results were similar,
the present results are important to confirm the generality of the
mechanism because we could obtain similar results using different
plasmonic nanostructures. The present results also support the validity
of the reported mechanism and indicate that the emission behavior
of NQDs can be modified using plasmonic nanostructures by controlling
the enhancement effects of the plasmonic nanostructure and the distance
between the NQDs and nanostructure.

Experimental Section
Monodisperse and well-defined AgNPs were prepared by the reduction
of AgCl colloids with ascorbic acid.62 Details
are provided in the SI. The prepared spherical
AgNPs were coated with a dielectric SiO2 shell (Ag/SiO2) of five different thicknesses by a modified Stöber
method (details in the SI).50,51 The SiO2 shell acts as a rigid, chemically inert, and
electrically insulating spacer between the NQDs and AgNPs. The NQD–Ag/SiO2 sample was prepared by first spin-coating an Ag/SiO2-dispersed ethanol solution onto a clean coverslip and then spin-coating
a toluene solution of commercially available CdSe/ZnS core/shell NQDs
(PL maximum wavelength: 605 nm; Invitrogen) onto the coverslip. To
control the distance between the NQD and AgNP, adsorption and binding of the NQD onto
Ag/SiO2 using chemistry are favored methods. However, because
these procedures damage the NQD surface and induce a low PL intensity,
the samples in the present work were prepared by a simple spin-coating
technique. The distance between the NQD and Ag/SiO2 was
not controlled in the sample. However, the minimum distance should
be identical to the shell thickness. A reference sample composed of
only isolated NQDs was prepared by spin-coating the NQD solution onto
a clean coverslip. AFM topography images of the samples were obtained
using an AFM (JPK Instruments, NanoWizard II) mounted on the microscope
stage.36,37

The emission behaviors of the isolated
NQDs were measured with
a Hanbury-Brown and Twiss type photon correlation setup in combination
with picosecond-pulsed laser excitation at 405 nm (10.0 MHz, 90 ps
full width at half-maximum) under a sample-scanning confocal microscope.36,37 Briefly, the excitation laser was focused on the single NQD by an
objective lens (NA 1.4; Olympus) and the photons emitted from the
NQD were collected by a same objective lens and passed through a confocal
pinhole and long-pass filter (LP02-514RU; Semrock). Subsequently,
half of the photons were detected with a spectrograph (SpectraPro2358;
Acton Research Corporation) with a cooled CCD camera (PIXIS400B Princeton
Instruments). The remaining half of the photons passed through a band-pass
filter (FF01-607/36; Semrock) and were detected by two avalanche photodiode
(APD) single-photon-counting modules (SPCM-AQR-14; PerkinElmer). A
short-pass filter (ASAHI SPECTRA, SIX780) was put in front of one
of two APDs to cut the near-infrared photons emitted from the APD
accompanying the detection of the PL photons. The signals from the
two APDs were connected via a router to a time-correlated single-photon
counting board (SPC-630; Becker & Hickl) for Hanbury-Brown and
Twiss type photon correlation and lifetime measurements. By analyzing
the obtained data with software designed in our laboratory, time traces
of PL intensity, PL decay curves, and photon correlation histograms
were simultaneously obtained for the single NQDs. The time-resolution
of the lifetime measurement (IRF) was approximately 0.3 ns. All measurements
were performed at room temperature under ambient conditions.
