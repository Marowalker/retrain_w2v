In
this work, a series of three copper(II) metal-organic frameworks
(MOFs), [Cu(4,4′-DP)Cl]n (1), [Cu(4,4′-DP)0.5Cl]n (2), and [Cu(4,4′-TMDP)Cl]n (3) (4,4′-DP = 4,4′-dipyridyl,
4,4′-TMDP = 4,4′-trimethylenedipyridyl), is designed
and synthesized under solvothermal conditions. Crystallographic investigations
reveal that 1 and 2 have tetrahedral and 3 has octahedral environment around the Cu(II) ion. By varying
the solvent conditions and ligand derivatives, the topology can be
interestingly tuned. TOPOS Pro provides topological conclusions that 1 is stabilized by unusual 2D + 2D → 3D polycatenation
of layers lying in (110) and (11̅0) planes with dihedral angle
of 90° showing altogether fes, hcb, and sql topologies.
On the other hand, 2 exhibits a bey (3,4-c net) topology and 3 shows 4-fold interpenetration
with the dia topology. The dc measurements
for 1–3 performed on polycrystalline
samples in a 0.1 T field confirm strong ferromagnetic behaviors for 1 and 2 and moderate antiferromagnetic behavior
for 3. To examine the sensing properties of the three
MOFs, various hazardous nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) were used as
analytes. While 1 is a potent fluorescence sensor for
highly sensitive detection of multiple NACs, 2 selectively
detects meta-dinitrobenzene (m-DNB)
with KSV = 5.73 × 105 M–1 and a remarkably lower limit of detection (LOD) value
of 1.23 × 10–7 M. 3 does not show
sensing ability toward any NAC probably due to the coordination environment
being different from those in 1 and 2. The
work demonstrates fine-tuning of the topology and in turn magnetic
and sensing properties by changing the reaction conditions.

Introduction
In the past decade,
the design and synthesis of highly connected
metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been of great interest for their
fascinating topologies and their potential properties as functional
materials. These framework structures among well-ordered pores are
exclusive materials for various applications in gas storage, gas separation,
sensing, and catalysis.1 Though various
MOFs could be designed by using multidentate ligating systems, their
ultimate topologies are finely tuned by several factors, including
metal–ligand ratio, pH, solvent, temperature, as well as the
oxidation state of the metal ion.2 Most
of such MOFs have recently been employed in optoelectronics, magnetism,
and material science.3−8 The most important strategy to design such frameworks classically
used in this area is the building-block approach.9 It is reported that (CuX)n units
can be used as incredible inorganic functional materials owing to
their rich network as well as their rich photophysical properties.10,11 At this point, copper halide metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have
shown interesting structural characteristics ranging from low-dimensional
coordination complexes to three-dimensional (3D) nets with various
structural motifs such as cubane Cu4X4 tetramers,
rhomboid Cu2X2 dimers, double-stranded [Cu2X2]n ladders, zigzag
[CuX]n chains, and hexagonal [Cu6X6]n grid chains.12−14 However, such MOFs have not yet been exploited for sensing applications.
Chemosensors, which work through fluorescence quenching, have gained
much emphasis in recent times.15 Detection
based on fluorescence has gained significant attention due to its
high sensitivity, short response time, simplicity, and its ability
to work in both solid and solution phases. Several pi-electron-rich
fluorescent conjugated polymers have been formed and are used in the
detection of nitroaromatic explosives in trace amounts.16 Especially, MOFs provide several advantages
over usual fluorophores when used as luminescent sensors.17 Their structural design allows enhanced host–guest
interactions and for them to be used as preconcentrators for target
analytes. The detection of highly explosive and explosive-like substances
selectively and sensitively is now a serious problem regarding security
as well as environment issues.16b,18 Nitrobenzene, a highly
volatile and explosive organic solvent, is the basic constituent of
nitroaromatic compounds. There are many nitro compounds that are used
in landmines and were used during World War II as explosive materials;
some of them are 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), 2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT),
2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP), nitrobenzene (NB), etc.18b The electron-rich conjugated polymers are excellent sources
for the detection of nitroaromatic explosives. The delocalized pi
electrons of such conjugated polymers enhance the electrostatic interaction
between the polymer and electron-deficient species.19 In recent times, apart from the organic conjugated systems,
some examples of fluorescent MOFs acting as explosive vapor sensors
have been reported.20 Such MOFs, due to
the high surface area, allow more analyte moieties to be contacted,
thus facilitating high sensitivity.21 Especially,
the detection of nitrobenzene sensors based on MOFs is a challenging
task with regard to safety and environmental protection.16c,18b

Herein, we report 2D and 3D MOFs with organic conjugated ligands,
4,4′-dipyridyl and 4,4′-trimethylendipyridyl, and copper
chloride as starting materials. We demonstrate a facile approach based
on varying solvents to control the topology of MOFs, and we further
studied their magnetism and luminescent properties. In this respect,
two bidentate dipyridyl derivatives were selected, and a 2D + 2D →
3D (interpenetrated or polycatenated) MOF, namely, {[Cu(4,4′-DP)Cl]n (1), a two-dimensional (2D) MOF,
namely, [Cu(4,4′-DP)0.5Cl]n (2) (4,4′-DP = 4,4′-dipyridyl)}, and
one three-dimensional (3D) MOF, namely, [Cu(4,4′-TMDP)Cl]n (3) (4,4′-TMPD = 4,4′-trimethylenedipyridyl),
with different topologies were designed (Scheme 1). Further, these three MOFs were examined
for their possible application as sensors against various hazardous
nitroaromatic compounds (NACs). Accordingly, we investigated the quenching
behaviors of a series of nitroaromatic compounds such as nitrobenzene
(NB), picric acid (PA), o-nitroaniline (o-NA), o-nitrophenol (o-NP), m-dinitrobenzene (m-DNB), m-nitroaniline (m-NA), and 2,4-dintitrophenol (2,4-DNP).
It is interesting to note that tetrahedral MOFs show fluorescence
quenching behavior, whereas the octahedtral MOF (3) is
reluctant to exhibit this property probably due to unapproachable
binding sites for any analyte to reach.

Results and Discussion
Structural Description and Topologies of 1–3
The color and shape of the
crystals of all the
three MOFs are the same (Figure 1). Crystal data with refinement parameters are summarized
in Table 1. Single-crystal
X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that 1 crystallizes
in the tetragonal space group I41/acd as shown in Figure 2. The asymmetric unit of 1 contains one
Cu ion, one chloride ion, and one 4,4′-dipyridyl ligand. All
Cu(II) ions show distorted tetrahedral geometries, where the Cu1 ion
is surrounded by two μ2-bridged chlorine atoms (Cl1)
and two nitrogen atoms (N1 and N2) of the 4,4′-dipyridyl ligand.
The bond lengths of Cu1–N1 (1.971 Å) and Cu1–N2
(1.986 Å) are shorter than the bond lengths of Cu1–Cl1
(2.436 Å) and Cu1–Cl1 (2.420 Å), respectively. Due
to the difference in bond lengths, the bond angles are also different,
which are shown in Table 1S, SI. The difference
in bond angles between Cl1–Cu1–Cl1 (104.31°) and
N1–Cu1–N2 (128.49°) is much more as compared to
the difference between those of N2–Cu1–Cl1 (99.75°)
and N1–Cu1–Cl1 (107.80°). In the 2D sheet of 1, there are two types of bridging between two Cu1 ions; the
first type of bridging involves two chlorine atoms between the two
Cu1 ions and the second type of bridging involves a 4,4′-dipyridyl
ligand between the two Cu1 ions.

The extended structure comprises layers consisting
of the Cu2Cl2 clusters connected by means of
the DP (4,4′-dipyridyl)
ligands (Figure 3).
The 2D + 2D → 3D polycatenation of layers lying in (110) and
(11̅0) planes with dihedral angle of 90° is observed (Figure 3b). The layers cross
along the c-axis direction. The topological description
of a coordination polymer includes the simplification procedure, that
is, representation of a network in terms of the graph-theory approach.
In the standard simplification procedure, metal atoms remain intact
during simplification, but ligands are represented by their center
of mass, keeping the connectivity of the ligands with their neighbors.
The subsequent secondary simplification of the net obtained at the
previous step includes removing the 0- and 1-coordinated nodes (extra
framework and terminal structural groups) and replacing the 2-coordinated
nodes (bridge structural groups) by net edges. Thus, this description
characterizes the way ligands and metal centers are connected. The
standard representation of the structure resulted in the underlying
net of the fes topological type (Figure 4). The cluster simplification
procedure implemented in Topos Pro allows one to identify more complex
building blocks of a structure and characterize their connection mode.
In the structure under examination, the connectivity of the Cu2Cl2 clusters by means of the 4,4′-DP ligands
is described by the 3-coordinated underlying net of the hcb topological type (Figure 5). The connection mode of more complex (Cu2Cl2·4,4′-DP)2 building units
identified by ToposPro is described by the 4-coordinated underlying
net of the sql topological type (Figure 6).

Crystal structure of 2 crystallizes in the monoclinic
space group P21/c as shown in Figure 2. The asymmetric
unit of 2 contains one Cu ion, one chloride ion, and
half of the 4,4′-dipyridyl ligand. Each Cu2+ ion
shows distorted tetrahedral geometry where the Cu1 ion is surrounded
by three chlorine atoms (Cl1) and one nitrogen atom (N1) of the 4,4′-dipyridyl
ligand. All the three chloride ions are μ3-bridged
having different bond lengths to the Cu1 center. It should be noted
that each tetrahedral Cu1 center is attached to the next unit of the
tetrahedral Cu1 center with a triply bridged chlorine atom and forms
a square net of Cu2Cl2. These square nets are
connected to the 4,4′-dipyridyl ligand to form a 2D sheet.

Each 2D sheet of MOFs shows weak hydrogen bonding interaction between
the hydrogen of the 4,4′-dipyridyl ligand and the chlorine
atom of the next 2D sheet of the MOF. Due to the weak interaction
between H and Cl atoms of the polymer, the formation of the zigzag
3D polymer takes place. The crystal structure of the C5H4NClCu coordination polymer contains one type of metal
atom, that is, a Cu atom with tetrahedral coordination, which is bound
by chlorine atoms, and one type of ligand—C10H8N2 (4,4′-DP)—as presented in Figure 7a. It should be noted
that the rods, whose composition is Cu2Cl2,
are present in this structure (Figure 7b). The rods form a square net. Further, these fragments
are connected in infinite layers (Figure 8) in the direction (110). The topology of
the resulting underlying 3,4-c net is bey (Figure 9) in standard
representation of the valence-bonded MOFs.

Crystal structure of 3 crystallizes in the tetragonal
space group I41/a as shown in Figure 1. The asymmetric
unit of 3 consists of two free metal centers Cu1 and
Cu2, and each metal center contains one chlorine atom and one 4,4′-trimethylenedipyridyl
(4,4′-TMDP) ligand (Figure 10a,b). Both metal centers Cu1 and Cu2 are hexa-coordinated
by two chlorides at the axial position and four nitrogen atoms from
the four 4,4′-TMDP ligands at the equatorial position. The
bond distances of Cu1–N range from 2.051(5) to 2.057(5) Å,
distinctly shorter than Cu1–Cl1 2.6726(16) Å, and similarly
the bond distances of Cu1–N range from 2.040(8) to 2.071(7)
Å, which are also shorter than Cu2–Cl2 of 2.722 (3) Å.
Both 4,4′-TMDP ligands connect pairs of Cu atoms of one crystallographic
sort with Cu–Cu spacing 13.372 Å. The Cu–N and
Cu–Cl distances and the corresponding valence angles are in
the normal range for coordination bonds (Table 1S, SI).22,23

(b), fragment of one 3D coordination network (c), 4-fold interpenetration
of the networks (d), underlying the net of the dia topology in standard representation (e), and normal mode
of interpenetration of the dia nets
(f).

The resulting network has a 3-periodic
motif. Due to large spacing
of nodes, the pores in the network are filled by three other networks,
producing 4-fold interpenetration. The 4,4′-TMDP bridges can
be simplified in edges, and the 6-c Cu atoms represent 4-c nodes after
removing 1-c Cl atoms. This (standard) representation gives a 4-c
underlying net of widespread dia topology.
The interpenetration can be described as “normal” for dia nets:24−26 each adamantane-like
cage hosts only one node of another net located on the diagonal, and
each window of one net is threaded only by one edge of another net.
In total, one 6-ring of one net catenates 18 other 6-rings from three
other nets.

FTIR Spectra and PXRD Pattern
The
solid-state FTIR
spectra were recorded in the range 4000–400 cm–1. This gives ample information about the bonding modes in 1–3 (Figure S1, SI).
The FTIR spectra of 1, 2, and 3 are approximately similar and give well-resolved peaks in the range
of the −2925 cm–1 region, which can be assigned
to aromatic C-H stretching frequency. 1, 2, and 3 also show v(C=N) and v(C=C) stretching
vibration bands in the 1612–1408 cm–1 region.
The medium-intensity bands for 1, 2, and 3 in the ranges of 474, 451, and 518 cm–1 are consistent with the formation of the M–N bond. The PXRD
patterns of 1, 2, and 3 were
recorded in crystalline materials at ambient conditions to check the
bulk purity of the synthesized MOFs. The recorded PXRD patterns of 1, 2, and 3 were identical to the
simulated data (Figure S2-S4, SI), confirming
the phase purity of the MOFs.

Magnetic Studies
The temperature dependence of the
magnetic susceptibility was measured under an applied dc field of
0.1 T in the temperature range 2–300 K. Field (H)-dependent magnetization (M) of the complexes was
also investigated at three temperatures (2, 3, and 5 K). Plots of
χMT product versus T (χM is the molar magnetic susceptibility per two Cu(II) ions)
showing strong ferromagnetic behaviors for 1 and 2 and antiferromagnetic behavior for 3 are given
in Figure 11a,b. For
the MOFs 1 and 2, the experimental χMT values at room temperature (1.03 (1) and 1.01 (2) cm3 K mol–1) are much higher than the theoretical one expected for the two uncoupled
copper(II) ions [χMT = 2(Nβ2g2/3k)S(S + 1) = 0.749 cm3 K mol–1, where g is 2.00 is the spectroscopic splitting factor, N is Avogadro’s number, β is the Bohr magneton, k is Boltzmann’s constant, and S = 1/2].27 These MOFs (1 and 2) exhibit the typical behavior of ferromagnetically coupled
dinuclear molecules with a continuous increase of the χMT value on lowering the temperature. These attain a maximum
value of χMT [1.15(1) and 1.13(2) cm3 K mol–1] at 20 K after
which they get populated. It is interesting to note that the factors
like lesser Cu···Cu separation and Cu–Cl–Cu
angle (<97) [Cu–Cl–Cu = 69.18 (1) and
72.34° (2) and Cu···Cu = 2.758 (1) and 2.881 Å (2)] give rise to strong
ferromagnetic exchange between the neighboring Cu(II) centers in the
MOFs 1 and 2.

Figure 11 χMT
product versus T plots for (a) 1 & 2 and (b) 3.

To evaluate the magnetic coupling constant, the experimental
susceptibility
curves for 1 and 2 have been fitted using
the Bleaney–Bowers equation for S = 1/2 dinuclear
models (eq 1)28 1  Best-fit parameters were obtained by minimization
of the agreement factor R (eq 2) 2  An additional
temperature-independent paramagnetic
(TIP) contribution29 was at first included
in the calculation. The fitting procedure gives J = 194(2) cm–1 with R = 5.98 ×
10–4 for 1 and J =
165(3) cm–1 with R = 5.82 ×
10–4 for 2. A fixed value of g = 2.0 is adopted in both fittings.

In contrast,
MOF 3 exhibited moderate antiferromagnetic
behavior. Figure 11b displays the magnetic property of 3 as the plot of
χMT vs T (χM =
molar magnetic susceptibility). At room temperature, the χMT value is 0.52 cm3 K mol–1, which is slightly lesser than the expected spin-only
value for an isolated Cu(II) ion (S = 1/2, g = 2.00). With lowering of the temperature, the χMT value slightly decreases up to 120 K and
reaches a plateau value after this temperature up to 2 K. Fitting
the magnetic susceptibility data with the Curie–Weiss law gives
the Curie constant, C = 0.45 cm3 K mol–1, and the Weiss constant, θ = −0.49 K.
The C value is in the expected range for a mononuclear
Cu(II) species in the monomeric unit of the MOF (3),
and θ arises due to the polymeric nature and the presence of
weak noncovalent interactions. The magnitude of θ discloses
the presence of moderate antiferromagnetic interactions between neighboring
Cu(II) ions. The nature of interactions, that is, weak antiferromagnetic,
is due to large Cu(II)···Cu(II) distances across the
bridging 4,4′-dipyridyl derivative ligand in 3.30

The reduced magnetizations (per
Cu entity), expressed in terms
of μB, of 1–3 at low temperatures,
that is, at 2, 3, and 5 K, were examined by varying the field from
0 to 7 T (Figure 12). The reduced magnetization (M/Nβ) vs the applied field (H)
curves of the complex increased rapidly at low fields but more slowly
at higher fields. The magnetization increases linearly at low applied
fields up to ∼2.0 T in all the MOFs and then progressively
tends toward saturation. The magnetization values at the highest measured
field (7 T) and the lowest temperature (2 K) are 2.30 (1), 1.71 (2), and 0.62 (3) μB.

Sensing Properties
Preparation
of Stock Solution for Sensing Studies
The
stock solutions of 1 and 2 were prepared
using a concentration of 0.0001 M, and various other nitroaromatic
compounds, namely, nitrobenzene, picric acid, o-nitroaniline, o-nitrophenol, m-dinitrobenzene, m-nitroaniline, and 2,4-dinitrophenol, were prepared in
dichloromethane (for 1) or ethanol (for 2) with a concentration of 0.001 M. In a 1 cm quartz cuvette, a 3
ml solution of 1 in dichloromethane, a 3 ml solution
of 2 in ethanol, and the fluorescence responses at excitation
wavelengths of 270 (1) and 240 (2) were
measured in situ with incremental addition of freshly prepared nitro-analyte
solution in the range 220–700 nm, with 10 nm slit width for
both source and detection.

Luminescent and NAC Sensing Property of 1
To study the potential luminescence sensing application
of 1 for detection of nitroaromatic compounds, the luminescent
properties of 1 dispersed in common solvents were investigated.
The solvents used are dichloromethane, methanol, ethanol, and water
(Figure S5, SI). Here, the fluorescence
measurements of 1 will be described in detail. Before
the fluorescence study, a finely ground powder sample of 1 (1 mg) was immersed in different organic solvents (3 mL), treated
by ultrasonication for 20 min, and then aged for 2 days to form stable
suspensions. The fluorescence spectra of 1 dispersed
in dichloromethane possess a strong fluorescence band at 321 nm. To
determine the sensing ability of 1 for different nitroaromatic
analytes, fluorescence titration experiments were carried out by the
gradual addition of 1 mM stock solution of various nitro explosives,
namely, NB (nitrobenzene), PA (picric acid), o-NA
(o-nitroaniline), o-NP (o-nitrophenol), m-DNB (m-dinitrobenzene), m-NA (m-nitroaniline),
and 2,4-DNP (2,4-dinitrophenol). Incremental addition of 2,4-dinitrophenol
has a minor effect on fluorescence intensity of 1 (Figure S6, SI).

It is interesting to note
that fast and high fluorescence quenching was observed upon incremental
addition of NB, o-NP, PA, m-NA, o-NA, and m-DNB solution as shown in Figure 13. The stability
of 1 after fluorescence titrations with different analytes
(Figure S2 SI) was also ascertained by
PXRD. Further, the fluorescence quenching efficiency was analyzed
using the Stern–Volmer (SV) equation, (I0/I) = KSV [Q]
+ 1, where I0 is the initial fluorescence
intensity before the addition of analyte, I is the fluorescence intensity
in the presence of analyte, [Q] is the molar concentration of analyte,
and KSV is the quenching constant (M–1). The SV plot for NB was nearly linear at low concentrations
and subsequently deviated from linearity, bending upward at higher
concentrations; those for m-NA and PA were nonlinear
at low concentrations but sigmoidal at higher concentrations; and
all the remaining nitro compounds, viz. o-NP, o-NA, m-DNB, and 2,4-DNP, showed a linear
SV plot (Figure 14). The quenching constants for NB, o-NP, PA, m-NA, o-NA, and m-DNB
were found to be 1.99 × 106, 2.11 × 105, 1.66 × 106, 1.72 × 106, 3.1 ×
105, and 8.0 × 104 M–1, respectively. As can be seen from Figures 13 and S7, SI, 1 shows a magnificent quenching ability toward NB, which is
quenched to approximately 97% of its initial intensity with the addition
of only 100 μL of analyte. Further, o-NP, PA, m-NA, and o-NA also show drastic changes
in their initial intensities. The limits of detection (LODs) were
calculated for 1 using the formula 3σ/m (where σ is the standard deviation and m is the slope of the
graph) [Figure S8, Tables 2S and 3S, SI].
The MOF (1) showed good LOD values, that is, 5.10 ×
10–6 (NB), 6.16 × 10–6 (o-NP), 4.88 × 10–6 (PA), 4.91 ×
10–6 (m-NA), 5.57 × 10–6 (o-NA), and 6.23 × 10–6 M (m-DNB), confirming its good sensing behavior
toward multiple NACs. Moreover, the colorimetric analysis of 1 in dichloromethane toward various NACs, NB, o-NP, PA, m-NA, o-NA, m-DNB, and 2,4-DNP was studied.

As shown in Figure 15, the change in color of the solution from colorless to pale

the addition of NACs to 1 confirmed their visual and
fluorimetric detection.

Luminescent and NAC Sensing Property of 2
To study the potential luminescence sensing application of 2 for detection of nitroaromatic compounds, the luminescent
properties of 2 dispersed in common solvents were investigated.
The solvents are ethanol, acetonitrile, methanol, and acetone. Here,
the fluorescence measurements of compound 2 will be described
in detail. Before the fluorescence study, a finely ground powder sample
of 2 (1 mg) was immersed in different organic solvents
(3 mL), treated by ultrasonication for 20 min, and then aged for 2
days to form stable suspensions. The fluorescence spectrum of 2 dispersed in ethanol possesses a strong fluorescence band
at 318 nm. To determine the sensing ability of 2 for
different nitroaromatic analytes in ethanol, fluorescence titration
experiments were carried out by the gradual addition of 1 mM stock
solution of various nitro explosives, namely, nitrobenzene (NB), picric
acid (PA), o-nitroaniline (o-NA), o-nitrophenol (o-NP), m-dinitrobenzene (m-DNB), m-nitroaniline
(m-NA), and 2,4-dinitrophenol (2,4-DNP). It is interesting
to note that fast and high fluorescence quenching was observed upon
incremental addition of m-DNB (Figure 16). Incremental addition of
NB, o-NP, PA, m-NA, o-NA, and 2,4-DNP solution had a minor effect on fluorescence intensity
of 2 (Figures S10–S15, SI). The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of 2 showed that the compound remains stable even after fluorescence
titrations with different analytes (Figure S3, SI). Further, the fluorescence quenching efficiency was analyzed
using the Stern–Volmer (SV) equation, (I0/I) = KSV[Q]
+ 1, where I0 is the initial fluorescence
intensity before the addition of analyte, I is the
fluorescence intensity in the presence of analyte, [Q] is the molar
concentration of analyte, and KSV is the
quenching constant (M–1). The SV plot for m-DNB was nearly linear at low concentrations and subsequently
deviated from linearity, bending upward at higher concentrations.
All the remaining nitro compounds, viz. o-NP, o-NA, m-NA, NB, PA, and 2,4-DNP, showed
linear SV plots, as shown in Figure 17. The quenching constant for m-DNB
was found to be 5.73 × 105 M–1.
As evidenced by Figures 16 and S16, SI, 2 shows
a good quenching ability toward m-DNB, and it is
quenched to approximately 77% of its initial intensity with addition
of only 17.5 μL of analyte. Further, m-NA,
PA, NB, 2,4-DNP, o-NA, and o-NP
do not show noticeable changes in their initial intensities, so 2 can be used as a selective sensor to detect small quantities
of m-DNB in ethanol. The LOD value for 2 toward m-DNB is calculated to be 1.23 × 10–7 M, which is the lower than those calculated for 1 toward any NAC (Figure S17, Tables S2 and S3, SI). Furthermore, the colorimetric analysis of 2 in ethanol toward the NACs, NB, o-NP, PA, m-NA, o-NA, m-DNB, and
2,4-DNP was also studied. As shown in Figure 18, the change in color of the solution from
colorless to pale yellow under daylight and disappearance of fluorescence
under UV light after the addition of m-DNB to 2 confirmed the visual and fluorimetric detection of m-DNB using 2. The present sensing results
toward various NACs, in view of the sensitivity, KSV, or LOD, are comparable with those of the MOFs reported
in the literature.17

Interestingly, 3 does not show sensing ability
toward
any NAC probably due to the saturated octahedral environment around
the Cu(II) center or due to the lack of molecular recognition ability
of 3 with NACs.

Conclusions
In
view of the material importance of the metal-organic systems,
three Cu(II)-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) containing dipyridyl
ligands, namely, [Cu(4,4′-DP)Cl]n (1), [Cu(4,4′-DP)0.5Cl]n (2), and [Cu(4,4′-TMDP)Cl]n (3), have been synthesized using
different solvothermal conditions. Single-crystal X-ray data show
different coordination geometries around the Cu(II) ion in the MOFs.
In 1 and 2, Cu(II) is tetrahedral, whereas
in 3 Cu(II) is octahedral. The topological studies show
that 1 has fes, hcb, and sql topologies, 2 has bey (3,4-c net) topology,
and 3 has 4-fold interpenetration and dia topology. Magnetic studies show that 1 and 2 exhibit strong ferromagnetic and 3 exhibits
moderate antiferromagnetic behaviors. Further, the fluorescence sensing
properties of the present MOFs toward various nitro explosives (NACs)
were examined. The fluorescence data reveal that 1 displayed
fluorescence quenching toward all NACs so it can be used as a sensor
to detect multiple nitroaromatic compounds. On the other hand, 2 selectively detects m-DNB in the presence
of other analytes with considerably low LOD value of 1.23 × 10–7 M. The PXRD pattern shows that 1 and 2 are stable in the presence of different analytes and the
framework does not break. 3 does not show sensing property
toward any NAC probably due to the saturated octahedral environment
around the Cu(II) center. Thus, fine-tuning of the reaction conditions
could lead to the products differing in structures, topologies, and
desirable magnetic and sensing properties.

Experimental Section
Materials
CuCl2·2H2O, 4,4′-dipyridyl,
4,4′-trimethylenedipyridyl, DMF, ethanol, and all the nitroaromatic
compounds were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. India and
were used without further purification.

Physical Methods
The FTIR spectra of the compound were
recorded within the range 4000–400 cm–1 utilizing
KBr pellets on a Perkin Elmer Model range GX spectrophotometer. Melting
points were controlled by the open narrow technique and were uncorrected.
The elemental C, H, and N investigations were acquired from Micro-Analytical
Laboratory of Central Drug Research Institute (CDRI), Lucknow, India.
The electronic range of the 10–3 M arrangement in
methanol was recorded utilizing a Perkin Elmer λ-45 UV-visible
spectrophotometer with cuvettes of 1 cm path length. Magnetic susceptibility
was measured using a Quantum Design MPMS-XL7 SQUID magnetometer. Data
were corrected for the diamagnetic contribution as calculated from
the Pascal constants.

X-ray Crystal Structure Determination and
Refinements
Crystallographic data of 1–3 were
recorded at 296 K on a Bruker SMART APEX CCD diffractometer. Single-crystal
X-ray data were collected using graphite monochromated Mo Kα
radiation (l = 0.71073 Å). Scattering factors
for the atoms, the anomalous dispersion corrections, and the linear
absorption coefficients were taken from the International Tables for
X-ray Crystallography.31 The data integration
and reduction were processed using SAINT Software.32 An empirical absorption correction was applied to the collected
reflections using SADABS,33 and the space
group was determined using XPREP.34 The
structures were solved by direct methods using SIR-9735 and refined on F2 by full matrix
least squares using the SHELXL-2016/6 program package.36 All non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic
displacement parameters. A summary of the crystallographic data and
the structure refinement for the complexes is given in Table 1.
