In
the challenging scenario of anode materials for sodium-ion batteries,
TiO2 nanotubes could represent a winning choice in terms
of cost, scalability of the preparation procedure, and long-term stability
upon reversible operation in electrochemical cells. In this work,
a detailed physicochemical, computational, and electrochemical characterization
is carried out on TiO2 nanotubes synthesized by varying
growth time and heat treatment, viz. the two most significant experimental
parameters during preparation. A chemometric approach is proposed
to obtain a concrete and solid multivariate analysis of sodium battery
electrode materials. Such a statistical approach, combined with prolonged
galvanostatic cycling and density functional theory analysis, allows
identifying anatase at high growth time as the TiO2 polymorph
of choice as an anode material, thus creating a benchmark for sodium-ion
batteries, which currently took the center stage of the research in
the field of energy storage systems from renewables.

1 Introduction
Current
tremendously growing energy demand is pushing forward the pursuit
of high-performing, cost-effective, safe and environmentally friendly
energy conversion and storage systems. Indeed, electricity generated
from renewable sources represents an oasis in the future to effectively
meet the demand for energy supply systems characterized by as low
as possible carbon footprint.1 However,
renewable sources, such as wind, solar, tidal, biomass, and geothermal,
are all inherently intermittent and, often, widely scattered into
isolated large-scale facilities around the globe.2 The best way to exploit these energy resources for practical
human needs is to set up smart and efficient systems to store the
energy they produce.3−7 To this purpose, secondary batteries represent a viable solution
for the integration of renewable plants into the grid and will play
a fundamental role to guarantee a brighter and cleaner environment
for future generations.8−12

Whereas Li-ion batteries (LIBs) offer the highest energy density
among present battery technologies,13−17 still an amount of open challenges remains to be
faced, particularly the reduced availability of global lithium resources,
which are also mainly concentrated in remote and/or politically sensitive
areas,18−21 and its increasing cost due to the rising demand for smart high
energy/power density storage devices. Indeed, people are now starting
to consider lithium as “the new gold”,22 as its price recently soared 300%.23 In this respect, sodium is rapidly emerging as an alternative light
metal for batteries: it is cheap and very abundant and has a uniform
geographical distribution.24−26 Its redox potential is −2.71
V versus standard hydrogen electrode (vs −3.04 V of lithium);
moreover, Na+ is heavier (23 vs 6.9 g mol–1) and larger (97 vs 68 pm) than Li+. This means that—when
sodium is considered—a small penalty has to be paid in terms
of overall cell operating potential and gravimetric/volumetric energy
densities, but it is anyway much more appealing than lithium when
widespread, low-cost, and large-scale energy storage systems (ESSs)
have to be implemented.27,28 For all of these reasons,
the investigation of materials for sodium-ion batteries (NIBs), along
with the correct understanding of their electrochemical characteristics,
has recently become hot topics within the scientific community.29−33

One of the main issues of NIB technology concerns the selection
of suitable anode materials.34−36 Graphite—the commercial
choice anode for LIBs—cannot be used in NIBs because of its
extremely low performance. Indeed, while Li+ ions are readily
inserted into graphite with a final stoichiometry of LiC6 (accounting for a theoretical specific capacity of 372 mAh g–1), only a very little amount of Na+ ions
can be intercalated into graphite.37,38 Such a limited
capacity can be explained from a thermodynamic viewpoint, being related
to Na plating on the carbon surface before forming the graphite intercalation
compounds.39

The lack of low-voltage
metal oxide anodes assuring reversible storage of sodium ions at room
temperature and for a sufficient amount of cycles40,41 can be justified by the large ionic radius of Na+, the
insertion of which in nanostructured electrodes requires substantial
distortion of the metal oxide lattice.42 To this purpose, titanium dioxide (TiO2) could represent
a viable solution, being a stable, safe, inexpensive, nontoxic, and
abundant semiconductor, able to intercalate alkali ions at moderate
potential values with specific capacities comparable to graphite anodes
in LIBs. Given these features, TiO2 would clearly represent
an interesting material to be investigated as the anode for NIBs,43−45 as first reported by Xu et al.46 and
Usui et al.47 Unfortunately, it shows intrinsic
low electronic conductivity, which accounts for relatively poor rate
capability. As a viable solution, the use of one-dimensional TiO2 nanostructures (i.e., nanowires, nanorods, and nanotubes)
provides shorter electron diffusion paths and improved conductivity
values.48,49 Among the number of approaches proposed
by the scientific community for the preparation of ordered TiO2 nanostructures,50 anodic oxidation
stands out as a well-established technique that allows large area
samples, along with the obtainment of uniform nanotubular arrays (namely,
TiO2 NTs) characterized by interesting characteristics
for various energy-related applications and relatively high specific
surface.51−53 Other two advantages of TiO2 NTs are relevant
in the battery field: (i) regularly aligned inner nanopores may provide
preferential pathways for the fast diffusion of the electrolyte, which
can also thoroughly wet the active material surface; (ii) the growth
process can be performed onto conducting flexible substrates (e.g.,
Ti foil), thus avoiding the use of binders and electronic conductivity
enhancers, which clearly influence the overall cell energy density.54

Despite some research groups have recently
proposed TiO2 NTs as the anode for NIBs, the scientific
community does not agree on some fundamental aspects as to which is
the best polymorph (e.g., amorphous or crystalline anatase/rutile)
in terms of overall capacity output and/or long-term performance and
which kind of modifications occur to the nanostructure during cell
operation.55,56

Very recently, we proposed
a possible explanation for the different electrochemical behavior
of the amorphous and anatase phases of TiO2 nanotubes,57 demonstrating the superior behavior of the latter
upon long-term reversible cycling in lab-scale sodium cells. Here,
we thoroughly investigate how the different experimental parameters,
related to the growth time of the nanostructures by anodic oxidation
and to different structural characteristics obtained upon annealing
at different temperatures, influence the overall electrochemical response
of the material, thus allowing to define the best performing polymorph.
In addition, most of the research works published in the NIBs field
consist in monovariate analysis; however, such a procedure often leads
to error when interactions between the variables occur. As a result,
we propose here an experimental design that simultaneously studies
different variables to obtain not only an empirical mathematical equation
for the considered factors but also a response map useful to consider
the influence of all the parameters. As a result, a systematic approach
to identify suitable active materials and properly optimize them to
develop highly efficient sodium-based ESSs is presented.

In
this work, we aim at identifying the best TiO2 polymorph
for NIBs, by means of a solid and combined experimental, computational,
and statistical approaches.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Morphological and Structural Characterization
X-ray
diffraction (XRD) and field emission scanning electron microscopy
(FESEM) analyses were performed on the different fresh samples as
well as at the end of the galvanostatic cycling test. XRD profiles
of the different anodized samples, that is, pristine amorphous (nonthermally
treated, namely TiO2-am) and upon crystallization in air
at different temperatures of 300 (TiO2-300), 450 (TiO2-450), and 600 °C (TiO2-600) are shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 XRD patterns of TiO2 NTs nonthermally treated and thermally treated at 300, 450,
and 600 °C. Dark colors indicate samples before cycling, while
light colors refer to cycled electrodes. The growth time by anodic
oxidation is kept constant at 5 min.

The TiO2-am and TiO2-300 samples show
only the Ti reflections (reference JCPDS 89-5009), independently of
the NTs length, thus accounting for their bare amorphous characteristics;
even if some literature references report the formation of anatase
at 300 °C,58 we did not detect it
in our experiments. The formation of an anatase polycrystalline structure
is clearly seen in the diffraction pattern of TiO2-450
and justified by the presence of the peaks related to the (0 0 4),
(1 0 1), (1 0 5), and (2 0 0) crystal planes (JCPDS 89-4921). As regards
the additional peaks present in the pattern, they originate from the
Ti substrate (JCPDS 89-5009). No additional peak is observable, which
might be ascribable to some foreign impurity phases. Finally, TiO2-600 shows both anatase (reference JCPDS 89-4921) and rutile
(reference JCPDS 87-0710) (1 1 0) and (0 2 0) peaks, thus accounting
for a mixed crystalline phase structure. Indeed, the resulting material
of the anodic oxidation process is polycrystalline, and there is no
possibility to induce a preferred orientation by acting on the preparation
parameters.

The dependency of TiO2 NTs array length
on their electrochemical performance as electrodes in sodium cells
was investigated. The length was controlled by acting on the time
of anodization during synthesis: Figure 2A shows the expected linear growth of the
nanotubes for 1, 5, and 10 min with corresponding FESEM images of
the cross sections. The resulting lengths are about 320, 1800, and
4800 nm, respectively.

Figure 2 (A) Graph of TiO2 NTs length vs time of anodization;
FESEM images showing different NT lengths are shown as insets. (B)
High-magnification FESEM images of the NTs annealed at different temperatures,
namely 300, 450, and 600 °C, for 1 h in ambient atmosphere.

Moreover, the effect of crystallization
was considered as a parameter of interest on the final performance
of the materials. Indeed, the as-grown TiO2 NTs are completely
amorphous, but they can be thermally crystallized in the desired polycrystalline
phase (anatase, rutile, or mixed phase) by simply selecting the right
calcination temperature in ambient atmosphere. The high magnification
FESEM images collected in Figure 2B illustrate the morphological evolution of the NTs
wall during thermal treatments. Almost no difference can be appreciated
up to 300 °C, but at higher calcination temperatures the nanotubes
walls start exhibiting some small cracks and an increased roughness
due to crystallite formation. In all cases, the TiO2 nanotube
arrays demonstrate excellent mechanical robustness and self-standing
ability.

2.2 Electrochemical Characterization in Sodium
Cells
The evaluation of the electrochemical behavior in laboratory-scale
sodium test cells was carried out at ambient temperature by means
of constant current (galvanostatic) discharge/charge cycling at various
current regimes, from 0.1 to 5 mA cm–2. It is worth
noting that, thanks to their self-supporting ability and excellent
mechanical integrity, the TiO2 NTs arrays supported on
the underneath titanium foil were directly assembled in laboratory-scale
sodium cells, without any addition of conductivity enhancers and/or
binders, thus leading to an increased overall energy density output
from the working electrode.

Representative potential versus
specific capacity profiles for all the samples under study are shown
in Figure 4. They are
extracted from the ambient temperature long-term cycling tests obtained
at different current regimes between 0.1 and 2.5 V versus Na+/Na (see Figure 3).
The formation of the solid electrolyte interface passivating film
at the surface of the nanotubes is clearly visible in the initial
discharge (Na-ion insertion) step as a steadily sloping pseudopotential
plateau slightly below 1.0 V versus Na+/Na (black profile
in all the upper plots in Figure 4). It is the main responsible
of the initial large irreversible capacity and corresponding low Coulombic
efficiency, in agreement with literature reports.57,59 After the initial irreversible reactions took place, the charge/discharge
processes unfold into typical S-type shaped reversible sloping potential
profiles, where a visible plateau is not clearly present for both
discharge and charge curves, but only the expected gradual evolution
associated with a continuous solid-solution reaction between sodium
ions and active material, as for the typical behavior of titania upon
reversible insertion/de-insertion of sodium ions.57,60 Overall, the process is highly reversible for all the samples, as
well-evidenced by the very similar Na+ ions insertion/de-insertion
capabilities, even when increasing the current regimes. This observation
clearly accounts for the lack of structural changes upon reversible
reaction with sodium ions and the good diffusion pathways. The symmetry
and shape of the constant current profiles remain almost unchanged
upon cycling, which accounts for the good structural stability of
the materials, as also confirmed by XRD analysis after cycling (see Figure 1).

Figure 3 Specific discharge capacity
vs cycle number at different current densities (from 0.1 to 5 mA cm–2) for sodium cells assembled with TiO2 NT
arrays as working electrodes, as described in Table 1.

Figure 4 Ambient temperature electrochemical behavior of the different TiO2 NTs arrays under study: TiO2-am (A), TiO2-300 (B), TiO2-450 (C), and TiO2-600 (D). In
particular, constant-current discharge/charge potential vs specific
capacity profiles are shown between cycles 1 and 170 at different
current densities from 0.1 to 5 mA cm–2 (upper plots
in A–D) and between cycles 170 and 300 at fixed 0.1 mA cm–2 (lower plots in A–D).

The potential drop at below 0.6 V versus Na+/Na,
which is visible in TiO2-450 and, particularly, in TiO2-600, is attributed to the reversible sodiation/desodiation
process in rutile TiO2 host, which is consistent with previous
reports.61,62 The process is visible, even if much reduced,
in the following cycles and, in particular, at lower current regimes;
this may suggest that the reaction between rutile TiO2 and
Na+ is a surface-confined charge-transfer process.63

The comparison of the constant current
profiles of the different samples clearly enlightens that TiO2-450 and TiO2-600, calcined at higher temperature,
demonstrate a remarkable increase in the specific capacity output
at 0.1 mA cm–2 and upon long-term cycling (lower
plots in Figure 4).
This reflects an increased material utilization upon reversible cycling
of highly crystalline samples, which is not the case for the materials
having a higher degree of amorphicity.

2.3 Nanostructure-Performance
Correlation by a Design of Experiments (DoE) Approach
The
experimental parameters behind the preparation (and related characteristics)
of vertically aligned TiO2 NTs and the resulting performances
in lab-scale sodium cells were investigated by means of a chemometric
approach. The proposed multivariate mathematical analysis represents
a powerful tool if the aim is that of optimizing functional materials,
especially when it is required to determine variables as others are
modified in the experimental work. By means of this statistical-mathematical
approach, the operational variables (i.e., the growth time of TiO2 NTs by anodic oxidation and the annealing temperature) can
be concurrently varied to identify the relative weight of each one
and the relation between them, particularly indicating synergies and
antagonisms. This approach aims at challenging the strong imbalance
that now exists between the technical ability to generate a large
amount of excellent experimental data and the human ability to interpret
them properly.

Fourteen sodium cells were assembled to investigate
the experimental domain in the proposed chemometric approach. The
overall constant-current cycling behavior at various current densities
(0.1–5 mA cm–2) of the series of TiO2 NTs arrays under study is shown in Figure 3, where the influence of the growth time
on the overall materials performance as well as the peculiar opposite
behavior of amorphous and crystalline TiO2 NTs samples
is well-evidenced. Only specific capacity values upon discharge are
plotted to simplify the figure and facilitate the understanding.

The chemometric matrix shown in Table 1 was filled with the
experimental responses corresponding to the specific capacity values
of the assembled sodium cells at the 85th cycle. The interpolation
parameters derived from the multiple linear regression were Q2 = 0.79 (i.e., the fraction of the variation
of the response that can be predicted by the model) and R2 = 0.95 (i.e., the fraction of the variation of the response
explained by the model). In other words, these parameters provide
the summary of the fit for the studied model, representing overestimated
(R2) and underestimated (Q2) measures of the quality of chemometric model fitting.
In the present study, R2 and Q2 are close to 1 (R2 in particular),
which indicates that an excellent description of the relationship
between the response and the independent variables is provided by
the regression model; this is also clear when predicted specific capacity
values listed in the last column of Table 1 are considered.

The set of experiments permitted the achievement of
a maximum specific capacity of 90.9 μAh cm–2 for the cell assembled with the amorphous TiO2-am sample,
which was grown for 10 min and clearly not annealed. Figure 5A shows how much each variable
influences the experimental response, with 95% confidence. From the
coefficient plot shown in this figure, it is possible to write the
modeling equation, which represents an empirical relationship between
the variables and the response expressed in polynomial form: 1  where y is the specific capacity of the various sodium cells. The numerical
values of the coefficients in the equation indicate the importance
of each factor in the equation. It is worth noticing that the coefficients
of x1 and x2 are positive, while those of the respective quadratic effects are
one positive and one negative. It means that a slight increase in x1 and x2 leads to
an increase in specific capacity, but high values of these factors
lead to opposite effects on cells performance. Lastly, the interaction
term x1·x2 is negative, and this indicates that there is absence of synergistic
effects between these two variables.

DoE; (B) response surface showing the effect of the two experimental
parameters on the specific capacity at the 85th cycle of lab-scale
sodium cells assembled with the different vertically aligned TiO2 NTs under study.

The response surface of the quadratic matrix of 14 experiments
is shown in Figure 5B, where the maximum response zone for specific capacity is observed
at x1 = 10 min and x2 = 25 °C. Two hypotheses were analyzed to validate the
chemometric experimental model:H1: a dependency between the variables
exists.

H0: a dependency between the variables does not exist.



By using the quadratic differences between the results
and their average, the Student’s t-test was
applied, and it gave a probability of 5% for H0 and of 95% for H1, therefore
corroborating H1 and underlining that
a dependency between the variables exists.

We decided not to
stop cell testing at the 85th cycle (although it was already enough
to extract information on the most promising electrodes, i.e., those
with the growth time of 10 min). Surprisingly, when we resumed the
initial current regime (0.1 mA cm–2), we clearly
observed the inversion of the behavior of the amorphous and the anatase
electrodes. Specifically, as clearly visible in Figure 6A, the samples calcined at 450 °C and
above were much more stable upon long-term operation, while the amorphous
sample and TiO2-300 calcined at low-temperature showed
a rapid decay of the specific capacity values. This is also clearly
detectable from the contour plot shown in Figure 6B, obtained by fitting the DoE at the 250th
cycle. The best performance was obtained by anatase titania samples
(i.e., calcined at 450 °C, TiO2-450), which were grown
for 10 min.

(B) response surface showing the effect of annealing temperature and
growth time on the specific capacity at the 250th cycle of lab-scale
sodium cells.

Summing up, the chemometric
approach enabled the following observations on the investigated system.
A direct correlation between growth time and specific capacity output
of the cell was evidenced: higher specific capacity values were provided
by longer TiO2 NTs, which were also able to retain very
long-term cycling stability. It accounted for the high quality and
excellent mechanical robustness of the TiO2 NTs prepared
by anodic oxidation in this work. This might be considered as an “expected”
result, but it is not trivial: very often, longer 2D nanostructures
lack by proper structural stability that causes a rapid performance
decay upon prolonged operation.64,65 As already discussed,57 TiO2-am showed an increase of performance
in the very initial cycles at low current, which was then followed
by a constant capacity decrease at all of the tested current densities.
The TiO2-300 sample showed likely the same cycling behavior.
This was independent on the growth time, as both longer and shorter
nanotubes had the same behavior. Highly crystalline samples TiO2-450 and TiO2-600 showed a rapid specific capacity
increase at low current density during initial operation; the specific
capacity gain remained constant even at higher current densities.
It is worth noting that the specific capacity of the crystalline samples
relentlessly and monotonously increased when the current was reduced
back to low 0.1 mA cm–2, which is a completely different
behavior if compared to amorphous samples. It confirms the superior
long-term cycling performance of anatase TiO2 NTs over
their amorphous counterparts. The presence of rutile phase, which
was obtained upon calcination at 600 °C, in the material did
not influence the overall cycling behavior but was clearly not beneficial
to the overall specific capacity output.

2.4 Nanostructure-Performance
Correlation by a Theoretical Approach
From the previous sections,
a distinction in the performance between anatase, rutile and amorphous
TiO2 clearly emerged. In our previous work,57 we demonstrated the superior behavior of the
anatase phase upon long-term reversible cycling in lab-scale sodium
cells. This is confirmed here, as the single-phase anatase polymorph,
obtained by calcination at 450 °C, provides the highest specific
capacity value after 300 reversible discharge/charge cycles. The growth
time also affects the electrochemical response of the material, and,
in particular, notwithstanding the calcination temperature, the best
results are obtained at longer growth time. In the present work, we
also demonstrate that the presence of foreign phases of TiO2 other than pure anatase negatively affects the electrochemical performance.
In this respect, the TiO2-600 sample shows a sizeable amount
of rutile, which is formed upon calcination at 600 °C (see XRD
diffraction patterns in Figure 1), thus resulting in a mixed anatase/rutile structure. It
shows a substantial decrease in the overall specific capacity output
at all of the different current regimes if compared to the single-phase
anatase (TiO2-450), which suggests the limited reversible
insertion/de-insertion capability of the rutile polymorph.

To
confirm this statement, we have performed state-of-the-art density
functional theory (DFT) calculations of Na+ insertion in
TiO2 rutile bulk phase, following the same approach as
for the case of TiO2 anatase bulk.57 We employed a 96-atom structural model for TiO2 rutile,
corresponding to a 2 × 2 × 4 supercell. The relaxed structural
parameters are in good agreement with the experimental values, as
listed in Table 2.

The rutile structure presents
a cavity that forms a channel along the [001] direction: in this cavity,
it is possible to accommodate a Na+ cation, as depicted
by Figure 7.

and O (red). (B) Minimum-energy structure for the insertion of a Na+ cation (yellow) inside the TiO2 rutile. (C) Zoom
over one Ti6O6 host “cage” for
Na+ showing six coordination oxygen atoms. The size of
this cage is determined by the two closest oxygen atoms (d1 in orange), while two other equivalent O–O pairs
(d2 in red) lie at a higher distance: d1 goes from 3.36 Å in pristine TiO2 rutile to 4.01 Å in the presence of sodium (Na0.03TiO2), and d2 goes from 4.49
to 4.41 Å.

The insertion energy
has been computed according to the following equation: 2  where E(Na:TiO2) is the total energy
of the system with the inserted Na+ cation; E(TiO2) and E(Nam) are the
reference energies for titania and sodium metal, respectively. The
computed Eins for the insertion of the
first sodium in rutile is 0.988 eV. This positive value means that
the insertion is not energetically favorable, and the reason is to
be found in the distortions of the Ti6O6 cavity
that accommodates the sodium: the oxygen–oxygen distances (see d1 and d2Figure 7C) are perturbed
by the large Na+ cation and especially d1 is elongated by ∼20% to make room for sodium.

The rutile unfavorable insertion energy should be compared to the Eins value of −0.14 eV computed for the
anatase phase.57 We also computed the insertion
energies for a second Na+ cation in different relative
positions with respect to the first cation; Figure 8 depicts the different configurations.

Figure 8 Structural
models for a second Na+ cation placed in different configurations:
(A) as next-neighbor along the same [001] channel; (B) in the furthest
position within the 96-atom supercell; (C) in an adjacent site of
a parallel [001] channel; (D) in a parallel [001] channel bridged
by a TiO6 moiety: the central Ti of such moiety strongly
goes off-center upon relaxation. Color code as in Figure 7.

The insertion of the second sodium is always unfavorable;
the computed insertion energies Eins for
the different configurations are (A) 1.379, (B) 1.725, (C) 0.855,
and (D) 3.074 eV. These high-energy values correspond to very unfavorable
insertion for a second Na+ cation. For the C configuration,
the computed Eins is the least unfavorable,
while the most unfavorable is the D configuration where there is a
strong displacement of a Ti atom in a TiO6 moiety in between
two insertion sites. These computed values in rutile are much higher
than the anatase counterparts, where the computed Eins values for the second sodium are within ∼0.5–0.7
eV.

All these theoretical results support a worsening of Na+ insertion capability for TiO2 nanostructures going
from anatase to rutile, in agreement with electrochemical experiments.
Moreover, these experimental and theoretical results are in agreement
with previous observations independently obtained for a different
polymorph (TiO2@C nanospheres) by Wang’s group.67 However, the anodic oxidation process here proposed
for nanotubes is faster and cheaper with respect to the hydrothermal
method used to design nanospheres by a template approach.

3 Conclusions
The best nanostructure based on TiO2 nanotubes as the anode for sodium batteries has been identified
by a combined physicochemical, electrochemical, computational, and
chemometric approach. The experimental design made it possible to
identify anatase electrodes grown for longer anodic oxidation times
as the best choice to this purpose, and the DFT study allowed to justify
this behavior. Anatase is the most stable polymorph upon cycling,
because it is not perturbed by the insertion of new Na ions and the
channels directed along the [001] direction guarantee a favorable
path for Na ion diffusion. Conversely, the insertion in the rutile
structure is not energetically favorable because of the distortions
of the Ti6O6 cavities that accommodate sodium
ions.

The combined approach proposed in this work allowed obtaining
a state-of-the-art benchmark as an optimized anode for sodium batteries,
an increasingly investigated electrochemical technology for the storage
of energy produced from renewable sources. Right now, as the TiO2 comprises only a small fraction of the Ti foil used, the
energy density for full battery cells of size for commercialization
will be quite low when considering the mass of the entire cell: a
proper choice of Ti foil thickness and an evaluation of its application
also in the field of sodium-ion microbatteries will be challenging
further steps in this field; alternatively, a thin Ti layer can be
deposited onto a standard current collector, subsequently proceeding
with the anodization process.

4.1 Preparation of Vertically Aligned TiO2 Nanotubes
TiO2 nanotube arrays were directly grown on titanium
foils (thickness 70 μm, 99.96% purity, Goodfellow) by anodic
oxidation. Before use, foils were cleaned by ultrasonication in acetone
and soft HF etching (3 wt % HF in aqueous solution for 1 min) to remove
the native oxide layer. The electrochemical process was conducted
in an electrolytic solution containing NH4F 0.5 wt % and
deionized water 2.5 wt % in ethylene glycol, using a platinum sheet
as the counter electrode (thickness 250 μm, 99.99% purity, Goodfellow)
at the constant temperature of 25 °C in a Peltier thermostat
(LAUDA Omnicool unit 62 Plus) under magnetic stirring. The anodization
time was varied in the 1–10 min range applying a constant voltage
of 60 V (using a dc power supply, GW Instek SPD-3606) to obtain nanotubes
with lengths ranging from approximately 300 nm up to about 5 μm.
Samples were then rinsed in distilled water and dried under nitrogen
flow. To investigate the effect of the crystallization on the electrochemical
performance, the as-grown TiO2 nanotubes were thermally
treated at 300, 450, and 600 °C for 1 h in ambient atmosphere
into a laboratory furnace by Abb Furnace Co.

4.2 Chemometric
Approach
The first step of our chemometric approach entails
the selection of the variables to be investigated and their relative
experimental domain. In agreement with the purpose of this work, we
selected the following experimental variables and related ranges of
values: the growth time of TiO2 NTs by anodic oxidation
(x1, which ranged between 1 and 10 min)
and their annealing temperature (x2, which
ranged between 25 °C non-annealed, i.e., amorphous samples, and
600 °C, crystalline samples). The two variables were codified
in 3 and 4 levels, respectively.

To carry out a multivariate
DoE, the software MODDE (version 11.0.2.2309, Umetrics) was adopted,
which is widely used in the chemistry field.68 An experimental domain as the one considered here can be investigated
by means of a D-optimal design, with the goal of achieving the maximum
information within a well-determined set of experiments with respect
to a stated mathematical model. In detail, if a specified regression
model is considered, such as 3  where y is a (N × 1) vector
representing the measured responses (i.e., NIB specific capacity), X is a (N × p) extended
design matrix that includes all of the n experiments
plus additional columns for the p model terms (e.g.,
interaction terms, constant term, square terms, etc.), β is
a (p × 1) vector related to coefficients that
are unknown and to be determined by fitting the model to the measured
responses, ε is a (N × 1) residuals vector
indicating the differences between the predicted and observed values
of the response y, and the D-optimal design constitutes
the statistical mean that permits the maximization of the X′X matrix determinant, being an
overall measure of the information in X.69

When chemometrics is adopted in materials
chemistry studies, the D-optimal design is typically built up by choosing N experiments (runs) from a candidate set, representing
the discrete set of “all potential good experiments”
included in the experimental domain that is initially defined by the
operator. After this step, the best design is constructed by a selection
process that depends on the number of runs that can be carried out
by the operator (some experiments can be performed easily, others
are costly) and on a statistical criterion. On the basis of our previous
experiences in the field, we selected G-efficiency
(Geff) as the statistical criterion, which
is defined by this mathematical equation 4  where p is the number of terms in the model, n the number
of experiments in the design, and d the maximum relative
prediction variance over the candidate set. The higher the numerical
value of Geff criterion, the higher is
the probability to obtain the maximum amount of information from the
experimental setup defined with the software and performed in the
laboratory. In the present case, the highest value of Geff was obtained for a D-optimal design built with 14
runs, which will be described in the following. A thorough discussion
of the mathematical and statistical basis behind the selected DoE
can also be found elsewhere.70 The experimental
matrix generated by the software is shown in Table 1. Our selected experimental response (y) was the specific capacity of the lab-scale sodium cells
at the 85th galvanostatic cycle, thus having a clear idea about the
performance of each device assembled with the TiO2 NTs
electrodes prepared accordingly to the experimental protocol described
above.

To evaluate the experimental reproducibility following
the standard criteria of DoE techniques, three replicates (named N7,
N13, and N14 in Table 1) of the central point were carried out.

4.3 Characterization
of the Materials, Fabrication of the Devices, and Electrochemical
Tests
The morphology of the as-grown nanotubes was studied
by FESEM analysis using a MERLIN ZEISS instrument, equipped with an
energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer for compositional analyses. XRD
analysis was used to assess the structural characteristics of the
materials. A PANalytical X’Pert MRD Pro instrument, equipped
with a Cu Kα X-ray source and a curved graphite secondary monochromator,
was used to study the samples both before and after galvanostatic
cycling.

The electrochemical behavior of the vertically aligned
TiO2 NTs upon reversible insertion/de-insertion of Na+ ions was studied in three-electrode T-cells made of polypropylene
and assembled by contacting in sequence a working electrode (i.e.,
Ti foil-supported TiO2 NTs disk, with an area of 20 mm2), a separator (that was a Whatman Grade GF/A product soaked
into a 1.0 M solution of sodium perchlorate—NaClO4 by Solvionic—in propylene carbonate—PC, Solvionic),
and a counter electrode (a sodium metal foil by Sigma-Aldrich). NaClO4/PC was selected as the preferred electrolyte solution as
we found it to be the most performing in terms of Coulombic efficiency
and specific capacity output and is also low cost and easily available.71

Constant current (galvanostatic) discharge
(Na+ insertion)/charge (Na+ de-insertion) cycling
was conducted at ambient temperature (≈20 °C) using the
battery testing system model BT2000 by Arbin Instruments. Discharge/charge
cycles for all the cells were set at the same rate ranging from 0.1
to 5 mA cm–2 and keeping a cut off potentials: 0.2–2.5
V versus Na+/Na. Procedures of devices assembly were carried
out under inert and controlled atmosphere by using a GP Dry-Glove
Box Workstation by Jacomex (H2O and O2 content
lower than 0.1 ppm), filled with extra pure Ar 6.0. Before assembly,
all samples were prepared and stored in an environmentally controlled
dry-room (10 m2, relative humidity <2% ± 1 at 20
°C) produced by Soimar Group.

4.4 Computational
Details
We performed spin-polarized Kohn–Sham DFT72,73 calculations by means of the generalized-gradient approximation
with the exchange−correlation density functional of Perdew,
Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE),74 as implemented
in the VASP code.75−77 The projector-augmented wave potentials were used
to describe nuclei and core electrons.78,79 The pseudo-wave
functions was expanded in a plane-wave basis set with a kinetic energy
cut-off of 600 eV and a k-point sampling based on Γ-centered
3 × 3 × 3 grid for the 96-atom TiO2 2 ×
2 × 4 supercell. With these numerical parameters the achieved
convergence for total electronic energies is within 5 meV per formula
unit. Furthermore, structural optimization were carried out until
the convergence of Hellmann−Feynman forces with a threshold
of 10 meV Å−1.
