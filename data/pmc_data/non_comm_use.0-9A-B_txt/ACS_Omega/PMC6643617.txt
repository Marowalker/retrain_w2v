Radicals in biochemical
environments can lead to protein damage.
Theoretical studies can help us to understand the observed radical
selectivity. In this work, the kinetics and thermodynamics of the
hydrogen-transfer (HT) and single-electron transfer (SET) reactions
between a cysteine derivative and 17 free radicals of biological significance
have been theoretically investigated in aqueous and lipid media. With
the exception of the reaction with •OCCl3, all SET reactions in aqueous medium have rate constants in the
diffusion-limited regime. The γ site of cysteine was found to
be the most reactive for the HT reactions with all the radicals, with
rate constants in the diffusion limit for •OH, •OCHCl2, and •OCCl3. The HT reactions from the α and γ positions
have very similar ΔG° values and even
though the β position is the least thermodynamically favored,
when the HT from β is exergonic it is a more reactive site than
α. The results obtained confirm that the Bell–Evans–Polanyi
principle does not apply to the reactions between amino acid residues
and free radicals and that reactivity comparisons demand proper kinetic
calculations.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Oxidative
stress (OS) is a recognized contributing factor in the
development of numerous diseases such as cancer,1−4 cardiovascular disorders,5−8 atherosclerosis,9−13 fetal growth restriction and preeclampsia,14−17 and several neurological disorders
including Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases.18−21 OS is caused by an imbalance between the production and accumulation
of oxidative species, including reactive oxygen species (ROS) and
reactive nitrogen species (RNS), which leads to cell and tissue damage.22 Most ROS are free radicals such as the hydroxyl
(•OH), alkoxyl (•OR), peroxyl
(•OOR), superoxide radical anion (O2•–), and hydroperoxyl (•OOH)
radicals. These species are frequently capable of oxidizing essential
biological molecules such as fatty acids, proteins, and DNA, causing
cell damage.

The reaction of free radicals with cysteine leads
to the formation
of thiyl radicals (RS•) and carbon-centered radicals,23,24 which could produce hydroperoxides resulting in cell damage.25 The hydrogen-transfer (HT) reaction between
the thiol group (−SH) in free cysteine and the •OH radical has a rate constant of 1.9 × 1010 M–1 s–1,26 while the HT reaction between the thiol group in RCH2SH and the R–CH2 radical has a rate constant of
2 × 107 M–1 s–1.27 This indicates the high reactivity
of the thiol group and suggests that ROS could be reacting mainly
with it.

Following the general structure of previously used
molecular models
to study the damage (and repair) of amino acids by radicals (and antioxidants)
in a protein environment,28−32 we are using N-formylcysteinamide (see Figure 1) to mimic cysteine
in a protein environment. Proteins are not the target of usual oxidants,
but oxidation can involve residues, located in any protein region.
Hence, no specific protein orientation or conformation is necessary
for oxidation to take place. Furthermore, the oxidative attack provided
by •OH radicals (the most common radical for protein
damage in biological systems) is random and nonspecific because of
their very high reactivity and low selectivity. Moreover, because
of the lack of unsaturation in the protein backbone, electronic effects
cannot propagate farther than two sigma bonds.

Figure 1 Structure of N-formylcysteinamide.

The reactivity of amino acids in a protein environment could
be
studied theoretically using reaction barriers. However, an alternative
and perhaps more complete approach is that of calculating the rate
constants (k) of the possible reactions, which has
the additional advantage of being directly comparable with experimental
data. Unfortunately, kinetic data available for the reactions of free
radicals with amino acid residues in peptide environments are very
scarce.

The main goal of the present work is to provide theoretical
kinetic
data for the reactions of cysteine residues with various biologically
relevant free radicals in both aqueous and lipid environments. Cysteine,
one of the most easily oxidized residues in proteins, has been chosen
because of the lack of experimental and computational studies about
its site reactivity. The ROS and RNS chosen for our systematical investigation
due to their different intrinsic reactivity are •N3, •NO2, •OR, and •OOR, with R = H, CH3, CH2Cl, CHCl2, CCl3, and CHCH2.33 Furthermore, the radicals •DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl), •ClO2, and •BrO2 were also considered,
for a total of 17 radicals.

Because the pKa values for cysteine
residues vary in enzymes,34 it is important
to take into account the population of the thiol and the thiolate
anion at physiological pH, in order to adequately model the kinetics
of the reaction between cysteine and free radicals. Hence, we have
studied two different reaction mechanisms, the HT from neutral cysteine
(which involves three reaction channels from positions α, β,
and γ, see Figure 1) and the single-electron transfer (SET) from the anionic (thiolate)
form of cysteine to the chosen radical.

2 Computational
Methodology
Electronic calculations were performed using
the Gaussian 09 software
package.35 Geometry optimization and frequency
calculations were carried out using the M06-2X functional36 and the 6-311+G(2d,2p) basis set, in conjunction
with the SMD continuum solvation model,37 using water and pentyl ethanoate (PE) as solvents. Because fats
are esters of glycerin with fatty acids and PE is the largest ester
for which solvent parameters are available in Gaussian 09, it has
been chosen to mimic a lipid environment. PE has been used in this
role in several computational biochemical studies.40,42,56−58

The M06-2X functional
has been recommended for thermodynamic and
kinetic calculations by its developers,38 and it has been successfully used (other than by the developers)
for that purpose.39−42 It is also one of the best performing functionals for modeling reaction
energies involving free radicals.43 However,
it could fail if the transition state (TS) presents multireference
character, which is not to be expected in this work. SMD is considered
a universal and reliable solvation model because of its applicability
to any charged or uncharged solute in any solvent or liquid medium,37 and it can be successfully used for optimization
and frequency calculations in solution.44 However, other continuum solvation methods, such as COSMO or IEF-PCM,
could lead to artificial inconsistencies and their use for thermodynamic
corrections in solution has thus been discouraged.45

Unrestricted calculations were used for open shell
systems. TSs
and local minima were identified by the number of imaginary frequencies
(1 and 0, respectively). Relative energies were calculated with respect
to the isolated reactants. Thermodynamic corrections at 298.15 K were
included in the calculation of relative energies, which correspond
to the 1 M standard state. Furthermore, the solvent cage effects have
been included according to the corrections proposed by Okuno,46a taking into account the free volume theory.46b Because of the cage effect of the solvent,
there is an entropy loss associated with any chemical reaction with
molecularity equal or higher than two. Reactant complexes were not
included in this study because they rarely have an effect on the rate
constant of a reaction.

Rate constants were calculated using
conventional TS theory (TST).47−49 Reaction path degeneracies were
assigned the value of 2 for attacks
to the β position of the cysteine residue and 1 for attacks
to the α and γ positions (see Figure 1). Tunneling was calculated assuming an unsymmetrical,
one-dimensional Eckart function barrier50 using Brown’s51 numerical integration
program, which requires the reaction and activation energies at 0
K, the imaginary frequency of the corresponding TS and the absolute
temperature.

When the calculated TST rate constants were in
the diffusion-limited
regime (k > 1.0 × 108), apparent
rate constants (kapp) were calculated
using the rate constant of the diffusion-controlled reaction (kD) applying the Collins–Kimball theory52 in conjunction with the steady-state von Smoluchowski53 and the Stokes–Einstein approaches.54,55 For details on the expressions used, please refer to our previous
publications on this subject.29−32,56−58

Branching ratios (Γi) for each HT channel
(i)
considered were calculated using eq 1 1  

Marcus Theory59,60 was used to estimate the reaction
barriers of SET reactions, where the SET activation barrier (ΔGSET⧧) was calculated using eq 2 in terms of two dynamic parameters, the Gibbs energy of reaction
(ΔGET0), and the nuclear reorganization energy (λ): 2  

The value of λ
could be calculated as indicated by eq 3, where ΔEET is the
nonadiabatic energy difference between
reactants and vertical products. This approach is similar to that
previously used by Nelsen and co-workers for a large set of reactions.61,62 3  

The methodology used in this work has been previously shown
to
accurately reproduce experimental rate constants in solution56 and has been applied in a number of theoretical
kinetic studies.29−32

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 HT Reactions
3.1.1 Thermodynamic Study
The HT reactions
considered in this study are shown in Figure 2, and the corresponding ΔG° values in aqueous and lipid media are displayed in Table 1. In general, it was
found that as the electrophilicity of the radical increases, so does
the exergonicity of the reactions studied.63

The three HT reactions
of 5 of the 17 radicals studied (•OH > •OCCl3 > •OCHCl2 > •OCH2Cl > •OCH3) are exergonic, with similar ΔG° values
for the α and γ reactions in both media.
Among these radicals, •OH produces the most exergonic
reactions (followed by •OCCl3 and •OCHCl2). In general, it was found that the
HT reactions from the β site are the least exergonic when compared
to those from the α and γ sites, which tend to show similar
ΔG° values, in all cases (although slightly
more exergonic for the HT reactions from γ). These observations,
based on thermodynamic considerations, might (wrongly) lead us to
conclude that the α and γ sites of cysteine residues have
similar reactivity toward HT reactions or that the reactivity toward
the α position is much greater than that of β. This point
will be further addressed below.

The β reactions with •DPPH, •NO2, •ClO2, •BrO2, •OCHCH2, •OOH, •OOCH3, •OOCH2Cl, •OOCHCH2 are endergonic in
both media. Thus, these radicals are not capable of directly damaging
cysteine at the β site. The aqueous reactions involving •N3, •OOCHCl2, and •OOCCl3 (also in lipid medium)
at the β site are slightly endergonic with 0 < ΔG° < 2.0 kcal/mol. This is also the case of the
α and/or γ reactions involving •NO2, •OCHCH2, and •OOCH3 in one or both environments. From a thermodynamic
point of view, the reactions with •DPPH and •ClO2 are the least viable in both environments,
as they are the most endergonic.

3.1.2 Kinetic
Study
Kinetic results in
aqueous and lipid media are reported in Tables 2 and 3, respectively.
The endergonic reactions were not included in the kinetic study of
the different HT reaction paths, because if ΔG° is significantly positive, the equilibrium constant (ΔG° = −RT ln K) is significantly smaller than 1 and in such cases product formation
would not be observed. However, slightly endergonic reactions in which
0 < ΔG° < 2.0 kcal/mol should be
considered for SET reactions. The Cartesian coordinates of the optimized
geometries of the TSs calculated in water and PE are reported in the Supporting Information section together with
their thermodynamic data at 298.15 K. The structures of the TSs in
water are also reported in the Supporting Information.

are only reported when k is greater than 1.00 ×

b There is
no TS; this reaction is
purely diffusion-controlled, as in the case of recombination reactions.

Even though the exergonicities
of the HT reactions from the α
and γ sites are very similar (with those from γ being
only 0.79 kcal/mol more exergonic), in all cases, the most reactive
site for HT is γ (the thiol hydrogen atom). Our results suggest
that the α hydrogen atom might be deactivated with respect to
the most exposed site. That is also the case relative to the HT from
the β site in most cases when the β reaction is exergonic.
This situation contributes to the protection of the integrity of the
peptide backbone because of the deactivating polar effect previously
proposed.28,64 There do not seem to be a consistent pattern
when comparing rate constants in hydrophobic and hydrophilic environments.

As expected, there is an inverse relationship between reactivity
and selectivity. The HT reactions with the three most reactive radicals
in both solvents (•OH, •OCCl3, and •OCHCl2) have contributions
from all sites, with β and γ being the most reactive.
These are the radicals that produce the most exergonic reactions.
The HT reactions from positions in β and γ to •OH and •OCCl3 are diffusion-controlled
in a polar environment, while in a nonpolar one, all the positions
lead to diffusion-controlled reactions. The third most reactive radical
in both environments, •OCHCl2, has diffusion-controlled
rate constants for the γ attack.

The alkoxyl radicals
are always more reactive than their equivalent
peroxyl radicals (with the exception of •OCHCH2 and •OOCHCH2) in both solvents.
For the halogenated alkoxyl and peroxyl series of radicals, the reactivity
of each of the three reaction sites increases (greater rate constants
are obtained) with the degree of halogenation of the radical in both
solvents (•OCH2Cl < •OCHCl2 < •OCCl3 and •OOCH2Cl < •OOCHCl2 < •OOCCl3); lower Gibbs energies
of activation (Δ°G⧧)
are obtained for each position in both solvents. Regarding •OCHCl2 and •OCCl3 in both
solvents, in addition to what was previously noted, it can be observed
that the Δ°G⧧ values
decrease in the series α > β > γ to the point
that
it is impossible to find a TS for the HT reaction from γ to •OCCl3. The γ HT reactions with the
OCCl3 radical are barrierless and limited only by the diffusion
rates because every collision is effective, as it occurs in recombination
reactions. We arrived at this conclusion after having searched for
the corresponding prereactive complexes. Every attempt to find them
led to the reaction products. Moreover, the relaxed scan of the S–H
distance in the presence of the radical confirms this because the
energy decreases as the S–H distance increases. The structures
of the TSs for the α and β attacks with •OCCl3 in polar environment are displayed in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Structures of the TSs
for (a) α and (b) β attacks with •OCCl3 in polar environment.

The radicals •OCCl3, •OCHCl2, and •OH are the most damaging
for cysteine residues in proteins via HT, particularly for the γ
(thiol) site in either hydrophilic or hydrophobic environments. The
radicals •OCH3, •N3, •OCH2Cl, •OOCCl3, •OOCHCl2, •OOCH2Cl, •OOCHCH2, •BrO2, •OOCH3, and •OOH are also predicted to threaten the integrity of proteins in hydrophilic
and/or hydrophobic environments, but to a lesser extent (at least
via HT; with rate constants between 107 and 102 M–1 s–1). In contrast, the HT
reactions with the radicals •NO2, •DPPH, •ClO2, and •OOCHCH2 are slow enough (with rate constants
smaller than 100 M–1 s–1) not
to represent a risk for cysteine residues.

One very important
observation from our work is that the exergonicity
of the three possible HT reactions from the cysteine residue is not
always directly linked to the degree of reactivity and selectivity
of the different radicals studied. The α and γ reactions
have very similar exergonicities, yet the difference in reactivity
is remarkable. Furthermore, in cases in which the β reactions
were exergonic and studied from a kinetic point of view, even though
they were much less exergonic than the α reactions, they were
in 8 of 11 instances a more reactive site. In other words, the Bell–Evans–Polanyi
principle does not apply, as was previously demonstrated for amino
acids with nonpolar sidechains.28,64

Hence, reactivity
comparisons demand proper kinetic calculations,
not a thermodynamic- or thermochemical-based analysis making use of
ΔG° values, bond dissociation, or reaction
energies. The crucial role of performing kinetic studies for reactions
between amino acids and free radicals has been previously pointed
out by Chan et al.,28 who asserted that
regioselectivity depends on structural factors, polar effects, and
solvent effects. Our results, with a different amino acid not previously
studied, are in agreement with the data reported by Chan et al.28 and confirm their proposal. As previously stated,28 calculated rate constants and Gibbs energy reaction
profiles can clearly explain the “abnormal” reactivity
of the α position without needing to use the “kinetic
trap” hypothesis of Scheiner and Kar, which lacks solid foundations.65

On the basis of the calculated kinetic
data, the reactivity toward
cysteine residues in hydrophilic environments of the radicals studied
is proposed to be •OCCl3 (kTOTAL = 5.44 × 109 M–1 s–1) > •OCHCl2 (kTOTAL = 2.85 × 109 M–1 s–1) > •OH (kTOTAL = 2.27 × 109 M–1 s–1) > •OCH3 (kTOTAL = 8.58 ×
106 M–1 s–1) > •N3 (kTOTAL =
1.39 × 106 M–1 s–1) > •OCH2Cl (kTOTAL = 9.00 × 105 M–1 s–1) > •OOCCl3 (kTOTAL = 1.83 × 104 M–1 s–1) > •OOCHCH2 (kTOTAL = 4.23 × 103 M–1 s–1) ≈ •OOCHCl2 (kTOTAL = 4.01 ×
103 M–1 s–1) ≈ •OOCH2Cl (kTOTAL = 3.76 ×
103 M–1 s–1) > •BrO2 (kTOTAL = 1.66 × 103 M–1 s–1) > •OOH (kTOTAL =
4.01 × 102 M–1 s–1) > •NO2 (kTOTAL = 1.07 M–1 s–1) > •OOCH3 (kTOTAL = 0.962 M–1 s–1) > •DPPH, •ClO2, •OCHCH2.

The reactivity order in hydrophobic environments is
proposed to
be •OH (kTOTAL = 3.51
× 109 M–1 s–1)
≈ •OCCl3 (kTOTAL = 3.50 × 109 M–1 s–1) > •OCHCl2 (kTOTAL = 1.51 × 109 M–1 s–1) > •OCH3 (kTOTAL = 1.38 × 107 M–1 s–1) > •N3 (kTOTAL = 7.52 × 106 M–1 s–1) > •OCH2Cl
(kTOTAL = 2.50 × 106 M–1 s–1) > •OOCHCl2 (kTOTAL = 9.73 × 105 M–1 s–1) > •OOCCl3 (kTOTAL = 9.43 ×
103 M–1 s–1) > •OOCH3 (kTOTAL = 6.57 × 103 M–1 s–1) > •OOCHCH2 (kTOTAL = 1.44 × 103 M–1 s–1) > •BrO2 (kTOTAL = 7.25 × 102 M–1 s–1) > •OOH (kTOTAL = 5.55 × 102 M–1 s–1) > •OOCH2Cl
(kTOTAL = 4.17 × 102 M–1 s–1) > •DPPH, •ClO2, •OCHCH2, •NO2.

3.2 SET Reactions
Cysteine residues in
proteins are involved in an acid–base equilibrium as shown
in Figure 4. The pKa value for cysteine residues in enzymes varies
greatly with some values in the 7.4–9.1 range.66 A value of 8.22 ± 0.16 has been reported for the aqueous
pKa of free cysteine,67 while a value of 8.3 ± 0.2 has been reported for a
cysteine residue in a particular enzyme.68 The pKa of the cysteine residue in glutathione
(l-γ-glutamyl-l-cysteinylglycine) has been
reported to be 9.2 ± 0.1569 and 9.42
± 0.17.67

Figure 4 Acid dissociation of
the cysteine residue in aqueous solution.

Because at physiological pH the concentration of the thiolate
form
of cysteine (Cys-S–) is significant, SET reactions
could take place and have been taken into account using the reactions
indicated by Schemes 1 and 2 for aqueous and lipid media, respectively.
The kinetic results obtained are reported in Table 4.

Very high Δ°GSET⧧ values were calculated for the
SET reactions in nonpolar environments, which suggests that this is
not an important pathway in this medium. This was an expected result
because SET reactions in general are more common in polar than in
lipid environments. The fastest SET process in lipid medium involves •OCHCl2 with a rate constant of 2.81 M–1 s–1, which is too small for this
reaction to be important.

With the exception of the reaction
with •OCCl3, all SET reactions in aqueous
medium have rate constants
in the diffusion-limited regime. These results suggest that the thiolate
anion of cysteine is very reactive toward SET reactions with free
radicals in polar environments, leading to the formation of the anion
derived from the free radical and the thiyl radical (Cys-S•). Thus, the SET mechanism should be considered to properly investigate
the reactivity of cysteine with free radicals in polar environments.

Finding that the most reactive radical via HT in aqueous medium, •OCCl3, is the least reactive via SET seems
an apparent contradiction. However, this result is a consequence of
the very large negative ΔGET0 of the SET reaction with •OCCl3, which places it in the Marcus inverted
region. This is one of the most surprising results of Marcus’s
theory.

To adequately model the kinetics of the SET reaction
between cysteine
residues and free radicals in hydrophilic environments, it is important
to take into account the population of the thiolate anion (Cys-S–) at physiological pH. Its mole fraction (χ)
depends on the Ka value of the cysteine
residue and [H+], as shown in eq 4. A correct rate constant for this process
must be multiplied by the corresponding χ (Cys-S–). 4  

The variability of pKa values
for cysteine
residues in proteins depending on environment makes the SET kinetic
results inconclusive. Using the pKa value
of 8.3 (Ka = 5.01 × 10–9) previously reported for free cysteine,67 at physiological pH (7.40), [H+] = 3.98 × 10–8 M, and χ(Cys-S–) is calculated
to be 0.11. Using this value, the previously calculated range of rate
constants for the SET reactions (listed in Table 4), which goes from 8.00 × 109 M–1 s–1 (with •OH) to 1.37 × 108 M–1 s–1 (with •OCHCl2), becomes 8.80 ×
108 to 1.51 × 107 M–1 s–1. These results indicate that, in addition
to the neutral pathways via HT, the ionized (SET) pathway plays an
important role in hydrophilic environments.

4 Conclusions
The kinetic study of the HT and SET reactions
between N-formylcysteinamide (the model used to mimic
cysteine in a protein
environment) and 17 free radicals in aqueous and lipid environments
was carried out using density functional theory.

In all cases,
the preferred HT reaction site is γ with rate
constants in the diffusion limit for •OH, •OCHCl2, and •OCCl3, which,
of the radicals studied, are the most damaging for cysteine residues
in proteins. The radicals •OCH3, •N3, •OCH2Cl, •OOCCl3, •OOCHCl2, •OOCH2Cl, •OOCHCH2, •BrO2, •OOCH3, and •OOH are also predicted to threaten
the integrity of cysteine residues in hydrophilic and/or hydrophobic
environments. The HT reactions from the α and γ positions
have very similar ΔG° values, and even
though the β position is the least thermodynamically favored,
when the HT from β is exergonic it is a more reactive site than
α. The results obtained confirm that the Bell–Evans–Polanyi
principle does not apply to the reactions between amino acid residues
and free radicals and that reactivity comparisons demand proper kinetic
calculations, not a thermodynamic- or thermochemical-based analysis
making use of ΔG° values, bond dissociation,
or reaction energies.

It has been shown that SET reactions are
an important damaging
mechanism for cysteine residues in hydrophilic environments with most
of the rate constants in the diffusion-limited regime, or very close
to it. However, SET reactions are blocked in lipid media because of
the lack of appropriate solvation for the anions, which are formed
in the transfer of electrons. SET reactions produce exclusively S-centered
radicals, so they are very selective despite the reactivity of the
attacking radical.
