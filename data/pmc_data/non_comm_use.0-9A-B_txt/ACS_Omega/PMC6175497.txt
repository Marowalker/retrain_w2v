Domoic
acid (DA) is a marine neurotoxin produced by several species
of Pseudo-nitzschia. DA causes severe
neurological toxicity in humans and animals. To address the current
analytical need to quantify low levels of DA in human and animal body
fluids, a sensitive and selective high performance liquid chromatography-tandem
mass spectrometry method was developed to measure DA in plasma and
urine. This method was fully validated to accurately and precisely
quantify DA between 0.31 and 16 ng/mL in plasma and between 7.8 and
1000 ng/mL in urine. Our group introduced the use of a novel internal
standard, tetrahydrodomoic acid to control for matrix effects and
other sources of variability. This validated method will be useful
to assess DA concentrations in biological samples of human or animal
origin after suspected DA exposure from contaminated food. It will
also be applicable to sentinel programs and research studies to analyze
body fluids with low levels of DA.

==== Body
Introduction
Domoic acid (DA) is a marine neurotoxin
produced by several species
of diatoms of Pseudo-nitzschia.1 DA is readily filtered and taken up by shellfish
that is subsequently consumed by predators and humans. Exposure to
DA via consumption of contaminated shellfish is a risk to human health.
During a marked algal bloom in 1987, 107 people experienced acute
neurological symptoms, and 3 died shortly after eating mussels contaminated
with DA.2,3 To protect human health, DA monitoring programs
have been established, and extensive efforts have been made to develop
sensitive and selective methods to measure DA concentrations in seafood
and seawater.4 The recently developed methods
include indirect measurement of DA via competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA)5 and direct measurement of
DA via liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)6−14 or laser ablation-MS.15 These methods
have been successful in monitoring DA in matrices that are available
in large quantities, such as seawater and mussels. However, no methods
have been published to determine DA concentrations in human blood
or urine after potential exposures to subacute doses of DA, and plasma
DA concentrations have not been reported in humans following contaminated
shellfish consumption.16,17 DA exposures have, however, been
measured using indirect competitive ELISA followed by confirmatory
LC-MS/MS in marine mammals, such as California sea lions (CSLs),18 exposed to DA via food and showing neurological
symptoms of acute or chronic toxicity. The DA concentrations ranged
from undetectable to 200 ng/mL in serum and from undetectable to 3700
ng/mL in urine. On the basis of estimates of DA exposure and toxic
effects observed therein, and from results of laboratory studies in
nonhuman primates, researchers and environmental health agencies have
proposed estimates for tolerable daily intake (TDI) of DA from 0.075
to 0.1 mg/kg/day.19−22 However, recent studies have shown that some recreational harvesters
consume DA in excess of the proposed TDI16 and that chronic low-level exposure to DA is associated with memory
loss.17 On the basis of the dose–exposure
relationship in nonhuman primates and physiologically based pharmacokinetic
(PBPK) modeling and simulations,23 we predicted
that a bioanalytical method with a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ)
around 0.2−0.4 ng/mL is needed to detect DA in human or nonhuman
primate plasma after exposure to DA at or above the proposed TDI.
None of the currently available methods to detect DA in serum by LC-MS/MS
reaches this sensitivity, and a single method has been reported to
detect DA in urine at this level (Table 1). Hence, more sensitive, validated, LC-MS/MS
methods are needed to assess human DA exposures.

DA is a hydrophilic molecule (clog P =
−0.23, value obtained from Drug Bank on June 12, 2018, https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB02852) with three carboxyl groups (pKa: 1.85,
4.47, 4.75) and an amine group (pKa: 10.60),24 as shown in Figure 1A. The ionized and polar nature of DA makes
extraction from biological matrices challenging. Solid-phase extraction
(SPE) has been used to obtain DA from complex samples,6,25−28 but this step can introduce variability into the assay via sample
recovery.

acid (THDA) in 10% aqueous methanol.

Several bioanalytical methods have been developed or optimized
to measure DA concentrations directly or indirectly in serum and urine
samples from various mammalian species, as listed in Table 1. However, validation data have
not been provided for any of the LC-MS/MS methods for serum analysis
and for only one of the urine analysis methods.28 Despite the extraction methods used in the published assays
and the known variability in analyte ionization in LC-MS/MS methods,
none of these published methods for serum and urine analyses includes
an internal standard. In mussel and seawater analyses, the deuterated
dansyl chloride derivative of DA,29 kainic
acid (KA),30 and leucine-enkephalin (ENK)7,9 have been used as internal standards for LC-MS/MS methods. These
internal standards have distinctly different chromatographic and spectrometric
properties than DA, which decrease their usefulness. They have also
not been applied to plasma, serum, or urine analysis. To address the
lack of internal standards in published methods, we explored the feasibility
to use fully reduced tetrahydrodomoic acid (THDA) (Figure 1B) as a suitable internal standard
for DA measurement by LC-MS/MS.

The goal of this study was to
develop and validate a high performance
liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) method
for quantification of DA in urine and plasma with sufficient sensitivity
to measure DA following low-level exposure to DA. The applicability
of this method was confirmed in a cohort of Macaca
fascicularis (cynomolgus) monkeys following a single
oral dose of 0.075 mg/kg DA (proposed human TDI for DA). To further
enhance the applicability, the method was cross-validated in human
plasma.

Results
Fragmentation Patterns and HPLC-MS/MS Optimization
To characterize the ionization and fragmentation of DA and THDA,
MS2 scans of the precursor ions and MS3 scans
of the two product ions were collected. The enhanced product ion (EPI)
mass spectra are shown in Figure 2. The product ions observed in the MS2 spectra
for DA ([M + H]+m/z 312)
are consistent with published spectral data.31,32 The MS3 spectra of the two product ions of DA (m/z 312 > 294 and m/z 312 > 266) and THDA (m/z 316 > 298 and m/z 316 > 270) support
the analogous fragmentation of the two compounds. HPLC-MS/MS multiple
reaction monitoring (MRM) was optimized for quantification of DA.
The three most sensitive MS2 product ions for DA (m/z 312 > 266, m/z 312 > 248, and m/z 312
> 220) and THDA (m/z 316 >
270, m/z 316 > 252, and m/z 316 > 224) were chosen for each
compound. The final MS/MS
conditions are described in Materials and Methods section. Representative chromatograms of DA and THDA are shown in Figure 3.

The on-column limit of detection
(LOD) of DA was determined to
be 0.52 pg (1.7 fmol) (Figure 4A). Signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) was greater than 3 for transition m/z 312 > 266, whereas the S/N was less
than 3 for transitions m/z 312 >
248 and m/z 312 > 220 at LOD.
The
on-column lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 1.0 pg (3.3 fmol)
(Figure 4B). The S/N
was greater than 3 for the all three transitions at LLOQ.

Method Validation
Selectivity of the method was assessed
by analyzing blank plasma and urine samples from six treatment-naïve
monkeys to determine potential matrix interference. An interference
peak was observed at 2.4 min in both plasma and urine chromatograms
with the MRM transition m/z 316
> 270 and hence this MRM transition was not used. No interference
peak was observed in the chromatograms with the other MRM transitions
(Figure 5A,B). Specificity
of the method was assessed by analyzing plasma and urine samples with
THDA as an internal standard and without DA to determine potential
interference from the internal standard. No interference peak was
observed at any of the DA MRM transitions. (Figure 5C,D). DA recovery was complete in all samples
with measured recoveries of 105 ± 10, 108 ± 2, 107 ±
10, and 101 ± 2% at 0.31, 0.93, 7.8, and 12 ng/mL (1, 3, 25,
and 40 nM), respectively, in plasma and 113 ± 9, 110 ± 8,
107 ± 3, and 106 ± 5% at 7.8, 23, 500, and 780 ng/mL (25,
75, 1600, and 2500 nM), respectively, in urine. Extracted samples
were stable for up to 5 days in the autosampler and up to a day on
bench top. Plasma and urine samples were stable at −20 °C
storage for at least five freeze–thaw cycles and for up to
28 weeks in plasma and 34 weeks in urine.

Figure 5 MRM chromatograms monitored
for DA transitions in plasma and urine.
The transitions monitored were m/z 312 > 266, 248, 220 for DA and m/z 316 > 252 for THDA. (A) Blank plasma, (B) blank urine, (C) plasma
with IS, (D) urine with IS, (E) plasma spiked with 0.31 ng/mL (1 nM)
DA (LLOQ), and (F) urine spiked with 7.8 ng/mL (25 nM) DA (LLOQ).

The DA/THDA peak area ratio was
linear between 0.31 and 16 ng/mL
(1 and 50 nM) of DA in plasma and between 7.8 and 1000 ng/mL (25 and
3200 nM) of DA in urine. All calibration curves satisfied the predefined
acceptance criteria with greater than 80% nonzero calibration standards
within 15% of nominal concentration. The LLOQ in plasma was 0.31 ng/mL
(1 nM), at which concentration all three mass transitions (m/z 312 > 266, 248, 220) were detected
with S/N > 3. The LOD in plasma was 0.16 ng/mL (0.5 nM), at which
concentration only mass transition m/z 312 > 266 was detected with S/N > 3. The LLOQ in urine was
7.8 ng/mL
(25 nM), at which concentration all three mass transitions were detected
with S/N > 3. The representative LC-MS chromatograms at LLOQ in
plasma
and urine are shown in Figure 5E,F. The intraday and interday accuracy (% error) and precision
(% CV) in plasma and urine are shown in Table 2.

Overall, the accuracy and precision
parameters would have passed
assay validation criteria if samples were quantified without an internal
standard. However, the variability in the quantification of extracted
samples nearly doubled in the absence of an internal standard, and
in long LC-MS/MS run batches spanning more than a day (>150 samples),
the variability exceeded 15% across the run without internal standard
normalization. In addition, occasional samples prepared from plasma
of individual animals had approximately 50% error in accuracy when
quantified without internal standard normalization. This poor accuracy
was corrected to 6% via the normalization to the internal standard.
This error is likely due to matrix effects on DA and THDA. Based on
an analysis of calibration curves of DA and THDA in solvent and matrix,
matrix effects were present for both compounds, and the matrix effect
was not different between the compounds.

This LC-MS method was
also cross-validated in pooled human plasma
and urine. Although different background peaks were detected in human
plasma and urine when compared to monkey plasma and urine, none of
these interfered with the quantification of DA or THDA. The human
plasma LLOQ was 0.31 ng/mL (1 nM) and the urine LLOQ was 7.8 ng/mL
(25 nM). Plasma and urine calibration standards satisfied the predefined
acceptance criteria with 89 and 100% nonzero calibration standards
of plasma and urine, respectively, falling within 15% of nominal concentration.
The accuracy and precision data are shown in Table 2.

Measuring DA in Monkey Plasma and Urine after
Oral Exposure
to DA
Plasma and urine DA concentrations were determined
in samples collected over a 24 h period from healthy female cynomolgus
monkeys (n = 10) following single oral doses of DA
at the human TDI of 0.075 mg/kg. Plasma and urine concentrations from
these monkeys are shown in Figure 6. A total of 77 plasma samples were collected and analyzed
to measure DA concentrations. Sixty three samples (82%) contained
DA above the LLOQ at 0.31 ng/mL (1 nM). The range of determined plasma
concentrations was between 0.31 and 11 ng/mL (1 and 35 nM). In the
remaining 18% of samples (n = 14), DA was detected,
indicating that the concentration of DA in these samples was between
0.16 ng/mL (0.5 nM, LOD) and 0.31 ng/mL (1 nM, LLOQ). A total of 60
urine samples were collected and analyzed to measure DA concentrations
and DA excretion into urine. All 60 samples contained DA above the
LLOQ of 7.8 ng/mL (25 nM). The range of determined urine concentrations
was between 9.4 and 745 ng/mL (30 and 2400 nM). Pharmacokinetic parameters
were estimated from nine monkeys (n = 9) because
the AUC could not be reliably estimated from one monkey, as more than
50% of the plasma concentrations were below LLOQ. A geometric mean
peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of 2.3
ng/mL (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.2–4.4) was observed
between 1 and 12 h after the dose (tmax). The geometric mean area under the plasma concentration versus
time curve (AUC0–24) was 19 ng·h/mL (95% CI:
13–28), the geometric mean amount of DA excreted unchanged
in urine (Ae,0–24) was 5.2 μg
(95% CI: 3.6–7.4), and the geometric mean renal clearance (CLr) was 4.5 mL/min (95% CI: 2.5–8.2). The potential presence
of DA or any potential interference in the assay was also measured
in plasma samples collected over a 24 h period from control healthy
female cynomolgus monkeys (n = 10) following a single
dose of 5% sucrose vehicle solution. A total of 20 plasma samples
were analyzed, and none of the samples contained detectable DA.

Discussion
Recent reports of DA consumption exceeding
the proposed TDIs in
recreational shellfish harvesters,16 and
the health risks associated with chronic exposure to subacute levels
of DA17 highlight the need to investigate
the exposure–effect relationship of DA. A sensitive method
to detect low DA concentrations in plasma and urine, such as the one
described here, would provide quantitative biomarker data to define
this exposure–effect relationship. On the basis of DA pharmacokinetics
observed in monkeys and PBPK modeling, a Cmax of 2 ng/mL (6.5 nM) was predicted in humans following a single oral
DA consumption at the TDI (0.075 mg/kg).23 This prediction set the required sensitivity threshold of analytical
methods for DA quantification at about 5–10-fold below the
predicted Cmax (i.e., 0.2–0.4 ng/mL)
to detect and quantify DA in samples from people with DA exposure
near the proposed TDIs.

Despite many analytical methods having
been developed for DA, only
a few of them have been developed to determine DA in biological fluids,
such as plasma and urine.5,6,25−28 Current published LC-MS/MS methods have largely been used to confirm
the presence of DA in samples that were positive by ELISA detection,6,18 although the analytical sensitivity of most reported LC-MS/MS methods
is lower than ELISA (Table 1). ELISA methods have been validated for DA quantification
in serum and urine,5,27 whereas no validation data exist
for LC-MS/MS methods used for DA quantification in plasma and only
a single LC-MS/MS assay has been validated for measuring DA in urine
samples.28 The method reported here is
the first LC-MS/MS method for DA analysis that has been validated
for measurement of DA in plasma samples. Importantly, the assay was
validated to detect concentrations at 0.16 ng/mL (0.5 nM, LOD) and
to reproducibly quantify concentrations at or above 0.3 ng/mL (1 nM,
LLOQ) of DA in plasma, demonstrating sufficient sensitivity to assess
subchronic exposures to DA. As shown by our study in cynomolgus monkeys,
the sensitivity of this validated method was sufficient to quantify
DA in plasma following a single oral dose at the proposed TDI. Similarly,
our method was validated to detect and quantify DA at or above 7.8
ng/mL (25 nM, LLOQ) in urine. All urine samples collected from the
monkeys dosed with DA contained quantifiable DA concentrations. Yet,
the LLOQ for urine samples can be further reduced with less dilution
to increase the sensitivity of the assay if needed.

One of the
major challenges when developing analytical methods
to detect DA in biological samples is variable recovery following
complex extraction or variable MS response due to matrix effects.
The recovery of DA from different marine animal samples following
SPE ranged between 20 and 100% resulting in challenging quantitation
of DA.6 A few published methods used KA
and ENK as internal standards in seawater and mussel analyses to control
for assay variability,7,9,30 but
the distinct chromatographic and mass spectrometric properties of
KA and ENK may decrease their usefulness as internal standards for
DA. Another recently published method introduced the use of the labeled
dansyl chloride derivative of DA as an internal standard,29 but the sample and internal standard are derivatized
separately. To address these issues with selection of an internal
standard, we synthesized and validated THDA as an internal standard.
THDA is structurally similar to DA and shares similar chromatographic
and mass spectrometric properties. We demonstrated the appropriate
chromatographic and mass spectrometric performance of THDA to control
for assay variability. The use of THDA improved the reproducibility
of the method as demonstrated by acceptable accuracy and precision
when the internal standard was used, but inadequate accuracy and precision
in the absence of an internal standard during long LC-MS/MS runs.
Importantly, although this method uses a simple single methanol extraction
step, THDA can easily be applied to other LC-MS/MS and sample preparation
methods that quantify DA in more complex matrices.

ELISA-based
methods to determine DA concentrations in samples from
marine mammals are convenient to use with minimal lab equipment requirements.
However, discrepancies between results from ELISA and LC-MS/MS methods
have been reported.27 One of the possible
reasons for these discrepancies is that marine mammals chronically
exposed to DA may produce antibodies against DA, which may interfere
with the ELISA assays, and hence ELISA assays would underestimate
the DA content. Another possible reason is that complex biological
matrices, like plasma or serum, may contain interfering components
that bind to the anti-DA antibody used in the ELISA assay, which would
overestimate the DA content. The validated HPLC-MS/MS method described
here provides a key advantage over the ELISA by obviating the above
issues and allowing direct detection of DA concentrations and exposure
in chronically exposed marine animals. However, the assay described
will require the investment or access to a state-of-the-art LC-MS/MS
instrumentation.

In summary, the developed HPLC-MS/MS method
described here has
sufficient sensitivity to determine DA concentrations in monkeys following
low-level (∼TDI) exposures. It also meets the reproducibility
criteria for method validation providing improved quality of DA quantification
in biological matrices. This validated HPLC-MS/MS method and the new
internal standard THDA can be widely applicable to research studies
and sentinel programs related to the health risks and exposure levels
of DA.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals and Reagents
A certified
calibration standard
of DA (332 μM) in acetonitrile/water (1:19, v/v) was purchased
from National Research Council Canada (Halifax, NS, Canada). HPLC
solvents, including Optima LC/MS grade water, acetonitrile, methanol,
and formic acid, were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh,
PA). DA, dihydrokainic acid (DHKA), acetaldehyde, sodium nitroprusside,
sodium carbonate, and sodium bicarbonate were purchased from Millipore
Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Frozen treatment-naïve monkey plasma
and urine were obtained from the Washington National Primate Research
Center (WaNPRC) at the University of Washington (Seattle, WA). Frozen
human plasma and urine were obtained from banked tissue at the University
of Washington (Seattle, WA).

The internal standard THDA was
synthesized, as previously described.33 Briefly, 1.5 mg of DA powder was dissolved in 5 mL of aqueous methanol
(90%, v/v) prior to the addition of 10 mg of platinum dioxide. The
mixture was placed in a round-bottom flask evacuated on a Schlenk
line flushing repeatedly with argon. Hydrogen, generated by drop-wise
addition of aqueous 10% sulfuric acid to an aqueous solution of sodium
borohydride (37 mg, 1.0 mmol, in 1.5 mL of water), was introduced
to the DA-containing flask via a hypodermic needle. After 5 h, the
reaction mixture was flushed with argon a few times, filtered through
Celite, followed by two methanol washes. The product is a mixture
of two diastereomers because the reduction process introduces a new
chiral center. This stock solution of THDA was stored at 4 °C
to be used as an internal standard.

The concentration of THDA
was determined by a colorimetric assay
using a mixture of acetaldehyde and sodium nitroprusside, commonly
referred to as Simon’s reagent.34,35 This assay
is used to detect certain secondary amines based on their reaction
with acetaldehyde and sodium nitroprusside.35 On the basis of their structural similarity, DHKA was chosen as
the reference standard to quantify THDA. The colorimetric response
at 590 nm was linear between 100 and 500 μM of DHKA under the
assay conditions. For the assay, duplicate 100 μL samples of
DHKA in water or THDA in 10% aqueous methanol were added to 100 μL
of 50 mM sodium carbonate–bicarbonate buffer at pH 9.8 in a
clear-bottom 96-well plate. To initiate the reactions, 50 μL
of Simon’s reagent containing 10% w/w acetaldehyde and 1% w/w
sodium nitroprusside in water were added to each well. Absorbance
at 590 nm was determined on a Tecan Infinite 200 PRO spectrophotometer
(San Jose, CA) between 8 and 20 min following spiking of the reagent.
The experiment was repeated on three different days. The purity of
the product was assessed by HPLC-MS/MS to be greater than 98%. Ultraviolet
absorbance was determined on Olis Modernized Aminco DW-2 spectrophotometer
(Bogart, GA), and the UV spectra are shown in Figure 1.

HPLC-MS/MS
Aqueous stock solutions
of the certified
DA standard and THDA stock at 3.1 ng/mL (10 nM) and 0.63 ng/mL (2
nM), respectively, were used to characterize their fragmentation patterns
and to optimize their MS/MS detection parameters on a Sciex 6500 QTRAP
system (Foster City, CA) by positive ion electrospray ionization.
The optimized MS parameters for both DA and THDA were ion source temperature
at 550, curtain gas at 50, nebulizing gas (GS1) at 70, drying gas
(GS2) at 70, collision activated dissociation gas at −2, ion-spray
voltage at 5500, declustering potential at 15, and entrance potential
at 10. Collision energy (CE) for MS2 analysis was set as
24, and excitation energy (AF2) for MS3 EPI scans was set
at 0.05. For MS2 EPI scans, Q1 was set to filter for the
precursor ions [M + H]+m/z 312 for DA and m/z 316 for THDA.
For MS3 EPI scans, the QTRAP function was used, and Q3
filter was set up to filter for m/z 312 > 294 (CE 15) and m/z 312
> 266 (CE 20) for DA and m/z 316
> 298 (CE 15) and m/z 316 >
270
(CE 20) for THDA.

The LC-MS method was developed and validated
using a Shimadzu UFLC XR DGU-20A5 (Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a Phenomenex
Synergi Hydro-RP 100 Å (2.5 μm, 50 × 2 mm2) LC column and a guard cartridge (2 × 2.1 mm2, sub
2 μm) (Torrance, CA) coupled to a Sciex 6500 QTRAP system (Foster
City, CA). A 9 min gradient elution was employed using (A) water with
0.1% formic acid and (B) 95% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid at
a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. Sample injection volume was 10 μL.
The gradient was initiated at 5% B for 1 min, increased to 100% B
over the next 3 min, kept at 100% B for 30 s before decreasing to
5% B over 30 s, and re-equilibrating at 5% B for another 4 min. Three
product ions for DA (m/z 312 >
266, m/z 312 > 248, and m/z 312 > 220) and for THDA (m/z 316 > 270, m/z 316 > 252, and m/z 316 > 224) were monitored to confirm
the identity of the analytes. MRM conditions were optimized to collision
energy (CE) at 24 eV, and collision cell exit potential at 10 eV.

The on-column LOD for DA was determined by injecting 10 μL
of DA standard in water at concentrations ranging from 0.031 to 0.31
ng/mL (0.1–1 nM). The LOD was defined as the lowest amount
of DA injected producing a S/N > 3 for the DA transition m/z 312 > 266. The on-column LLOQ was
defined as
the lowest amount of injected DA producing a S/N > 3 for all three
DA mass transitions m/z 312 >
266,
248, 220. Calibration standards covering 4 orders of magnitude at
concentrations ranging from 0.031 to 310 ng/mL (0.1–1000 nM)
of DA were prepared in water to determine the linearity of response
(peak area of DA mass transition m/z 312 > 266).

DA Extraction from Plasma and Urine Samples
DA was
extracted from plasma by mixing 60 μL of plasma standards or
samples with 120 μL LC/MS grade methanol containing 0.63 ng/mL
(2 nM) THDA and vortexed for 30 s to precipitate proteins. The precipitated
plasma standards and samples were centrifuged at 16 100g for 60 min, and the supernatant was removed for HPLC-MS/MS
analysis. DA was extracted from urine by mixing 10 μL of urine
standards or samples with 490 μL of LC/MS grade water containing
0.63 ng/mL (2 nM) THDA and subsequently 500 μL of methanol.
The urine was vortexed for 30 s to precipitate proteins and centrifuged
at 16 100g for 15 min. The supernatant was
removed for HPLC-MS/MS analysis.

Method Validation
The method was validated according
to the FDA Guidance for Industry Bioanalytical Method Validation36 using pooled cynomolgus monkey plasma and urine.
The plasma calibration standards were prepared by spiking plasma with
the DA certified standard and serially diluting with plasma to nine
concentrations ranging between 0.16 and 16 ng/mL (0.5–50 nM).
The urine calibration standards were prepared by spiking urine with
DA certified standard and serially diluting with urine to nine concentrations
ranging between 7.8 and 1000 ng/mL (25–3200 nM). The calibration
standards were processed and analyzed by HPLC-MS/MS, as described
above. The MRM chromatograms were integrated using AB Sciex MultiQuant
software version 2.1.1 (Foster City, CA). DA was quantified using
the peak area ratio of m/z 312 >
266 (DA) and m/z 316 > 252 (THDA),
and a weighted (1/y2) calibration curve
was fitted linearly to the data. The 1/y2 weighing was used as the simplest weighing scheme providing sufficient
accuracy over the concentration range used. The 1/y2 weighing provided better accuracy over the concentration
range studied in comparison to uniform weighing. The acceptance criteria
for each calibration curve were defined as greater than 75% of all
nonzero concentrations determined with less than 15% error from the
nominal concentrations, except at the LLOQ, which was accepted with
less than 20% error.

Plasma QCs were prepared by spiking blank
plasma with DA certified standard to 0.31 ng/mL (LLOQ), 0.93 ng/mL
(LQC), 7.8 ng/mL (MQC), 12 ng/mL (HQC) (1, 3, 25, 40 nM). Urine QCs
were prepared by spiking blank urine with DA certified standard to
7.8 ng/mL (LLOQ), 23 ng/mL (LQC), 500 ng/mL (MQC), 780 ng/mL (HQC)
(25, 75, 1600, 2500 nM). Blank plasma and urine from six treatment-naïve
cynomolgus monkeys with and without internal standard were analyzed
for potential interference. The accuracy and precision of the method
were determined on three different days. Interday variability was
calculated with at least 12 replicates of each QC analyzed on 3 different
days. Intraday variability was determined with five replicates analyzed
on the same day. Calibration standards were analyzed in duplicates
along with blanks and replicates of QCs (LLOQ, LQC, MQC, HQC) in each
run. The LLOQ was defined as the lowest concentration in plasma or
urine with S/N > 3 for DA transition m/z 312 > 266 that could be repeatedly determined with
less than 20%
error and within 20% CV. The % error and % CV were calculated according
to eqs 1 and 2 1   2  The LOD was defined as the
lowest concentration
in plasma and urine with S/N > 3 for the DA transition m/z 312 > 266, but did not meet the
LLOQ acceptance
criteria for reproducibility. QCs with less than 15% error from the
nominal concentration or less than 20% error at LLOQ were accepted.

Stability of extracted samples was determined by repeated injections
of QC samples (LQC, MQC, HQC) stored either in the autosampler at
4 °C for up to 5 days or on bench top at room temperature for
a day. Acceptance criterion of extracted sample stability was defined
as less than 15% CV from repeated injections. Long-term stability
was determined by repeated analysis of spiked plasma controls at 0.93,
1.9, 3.7 ng/mL (3, 6, 12 nM) and spiked urine controls at 16, 160,
620 ng/mL (50, 500, 2000 nM) stored at −20 °C and that
were subjected to at least five freeze–thaw cycles. Acceptance
criterion of long-term stability was defined as less than 15% CV of
measured concentration from repeated analysis.

Recovery of DA
was determined at 0.31, 0.93, 7.8, 12 ng/mL (1,
3, 25, 40 nM) of DA in plasma and 7.8, 23, 500, 780 ng/mL (25, 75,
1600, 2500 nM) of DA in urine in triplicates. The recovery was calculated
by comparing the DA/THDA peak area ratio of samples spiked with DA
prior to methanol extraction to DA/THDA peak area ratio in samples
extracted with methanol and subsequently spiked with the DA at matching
amount. The THDA (0.32 ng/mL) was added to all samples following extraction.
The percent recovery was reported as the percentage of peak area ratio
of recovery samples divided by the mean peak area ratio of control
samples.

Cross-validation using human plasma and urine was performed
in
a single accuracy and precision validation run. Plasma and urine calibration
standards and QCs were prepared as described for monkey standards
and QCs. Plasma and urine were pooled from banked tissue from six
individuals. Potential matrix interferences were assessed by analyzing
blank plasma and urine. Duplicates of calibration standards and five
replicates of LQC, MQC, HQC, and four replicates of LLOQ were included
in the cross-validation to assess variability.

Animal Study Samples and
Application of the Method
Monkey plasma and urine samples
from a DA toxicokinetic study were
analyzed to evaluate the applicability of the assay to determine DA
exposure after a single oral dose at the proposed TDI of 0.075 mg/kg.
All animal procedures followed the guidelines set by the Animal Welfare
Act and the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of National
Research Council. The research protocol was approved by the University
of Washington Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Fresh blood
and urine samples were obtained at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 h
from 20 healthy adult female cynomolgus monkeys following a single
oral dose of 0.075 mg/kg DA in 5% sucrose in water (n = 10) or a single oral dose of 5% sucrose in water (n = 10). Training protocols using positive reinforcement were implemented
to collect blood without sedation. Fresh blood was collected from
the peripheral vein using sodium heparin-coated collection tubes and
centrifuged at 3000g for 15 min within 1 h of collection
to isolate plasma from blood cells. The plasma samples were stored
at −20 °C until analysis. Urine was collected from the
cage pans equipped with metabolic urine collection trays at the same
time fresh blood was collected. The total volume of urine in the pan
was measured, and a 2 mL sample was collected before discarding the
rest of the urine. The urine samples were stored at −20 °C
until analysis.

Pharmacokinetic Analysis
Pharmacokinetic
parameters,
including area under the plasma concentration–time curve (AUC)
and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), were estimated by noncompartmental analysis using Phoenix WinNonlin
(St. Louis, MO). The plasma concentration was assigned to be 0.2 ng/mL
when DA was detected but was below the LLOQ for AUC calculation. The
cumulative amount of unchanged DA excreted in urine (Ae) was calculated from the determined concentration and
the volume of urine at all collection time intervals using eq 3. Renal clearance (CLr) was estimated from the cumulative amount excreted unchanged
in urine and the plasma AUC using eq 4 3   4
