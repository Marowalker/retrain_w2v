Metal-doped titanate nanotubes (TNTs) were synthesized
using a
simple ion-exchange method. Cations with different valencies (Mg2+, Ca2+, Zn2+, K+, Cr3+, Ce3+, Ce4+, Mo5+, and
La3+) were used to assess their effects on the adsorption
performance and optical properties of the prepared nanotubes. All
samples were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), field-emission
scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDXS), and elemental mapping, and the optical properties were analyzed
using photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. The adsorption performance
of the prepared doped titanate nanotubes was tested against methylene
blue (MB) as a model cation dye. The results revealed that all samples
except Ce(IV)-TNT showed high removal efficiencies but at different
equilibrium times. Mg-TNT, Zn-TNT, and K-TNT showed higher MB removal
percentages (97%) after 45 min, while Ca-TNT, Cr-TNT, Ce(III)-TNT,
Mo-TNT, La-TNT, and Na-TNT showed removal efficiencies of 95, 84,
95, 96, 94, and 96% after 65, 1200, 120, 300, 180, and 105 min, respectively.
The titanate nanotubes were recycled by photocatalytic degradation
of the adsorbed dye molecules. The band gaps, valence band, and conduction
band were calculated and compared for the potential photocatalytic
water splitting application.

1 Introduction
The shortage of water
for agriculture and human purposes is a serious
problem faced by millions of people all over the world and is increasing
year by year due to the continuous increase in population. These facts
motivated research studies to find solutions for this problem. One
of the feasible solutions is treating wastewater to be reused in certain
purposes. The main toxic pollutants are heavy metals and organic compounds,
especially dyes. Dyes are widely used in various industries such as
textile, cosmetic, and food industries, but unfortunately they cause
serious problem to humans, plants, and animals because of their strong
colors or carcinogenicity.1,2 Based on these facts,
these dyes from waste effluents is an important issue. Many potential
methods have been proposed to treat effluents containing organic dyes.3−6 Among these methods, adsorption and photocatalytic degradation of
dyes attracted attention of most of the researchers due to their low
cost and effectiveness. Many materials have been taken as adsorbents,
such as activated carbon,7 graphene,8 and layered double hydroxides,9 while materials like ZnO, ferrites, and TiO2 and titanate nanostructures have served as photocatalysts. It became
a challenge to find a material that has a dual action; that is, it
can be used as an adsorbent and a photocatalyst simultaneously. Titanate
nanotubes (TNTs) prepared by a hydrothermal method showed great affinity
toward dye adsorption due to their high surface area and the charge
is tunable by manipulating the pH value.10,11 The optical properties of these nanotubes can be tuned with metal
modification by an ion-exchange method, where the sodium titanate
nanotubes are converted into promising metal-doped titanate nanotubes
that can be used in photocatalysis and other vital applications.12−16

Here, in this work, we report the effects of dopant valency
on
the adsorption capacity and the optical properties of the doped titanate
nanotubes for the first time.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Synthesis of Metal-Doped Titanate Nanotubes
First, sodium titanate nanotubes were prepared by a common simple
hydrothermal method.17−22 In brief, 10 g of TiO2 nanoparticles (about 70 nm) were
mixed with 500 mL of 10 N NaOH and the mixture was subjected to magnetic
stirring for 30 min until a white milky suspension was formed. The
suspension was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave and placed
in an oven for 23 h at 160 °C. The sample was collected after
cooling to room temperature and then washed many times with distilled
water until reached a neutral pH value. Finally, the sample was dried
at 100 °C to obtain sodium titanate nanotubes (Na-TNTs).

To prepare metal-doped titanate nanotubes, metal salts were mixed
with sodium titanate nanotubes with a w/w ratio of 1:3 to ensure the
presence of excess amounts of metal cations to replace all Na+. Magnesium sulfate heptahydrate, calcium sulfate dihydrate,
zinc sulfate heptahydrate, potassium nitrate, chromium acetate, cerium(IV)
sulfate tetrahydrate, cerium(III) sulfate heptahydrate, molybedenum(V)
chloride, and lanthanum chloride were mixed individually with Na-TNT
to produce Mg-TNT, Ca-TNT, Zn-TNT, K-TNT, Cr-TNT, Ce(IV)-TNT, Ce(III)-TNT,
Mo-TNT, and La-TNT, respectively. The mixtures were subjected to ultrasonication
with a probe (20 kHz, pulsed mode 9.9 s on and 3 s off) for 15 min,
and then, the formed doped titanate nanotubes were washed several
times with distilled water to remove the unreacted and resulted sodium
salts. Finally, the samples were dried at 100 °C for 12 h.

2.2 Characterization of the Prepared Doped Titanate
Nanotubes
Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM),
energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS), and elemental mapping
images were obtained from JEOL-JSM-6500F, Japan. A Panalytical (Empyrean)
X-ray diffractometer was used to record the X-ray powder diffraction
(XRD) patterns using Cu Kα radiation (wavelength 0.154 cm–1) at an accelerating voltage of 40 kV, a current of
35 mA, a scan angle range of 5–80°, and a scan step of
0.02°. The ζ-potential was determined using a Zetasizer,
Nano-ZS90 (Malvern, U.K). Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained
using a Micro/Macro PL mapping system (UniNanoTech Co. Ltd.), in a
dark chamber. The measurements were performed using 375 and 470 ps
pulse lasers. To avoid the reabsorption effects, the measurements
were performed in a 90° configuration and the PL signal was detected
in the same direction of the reflected excitation beam.

2.3 Adsorption Study
A 200 ppm stock
solution of methylene blue (MB) was prepared by dissolving the powder
in distilled water; different concentration solutions of methylene
blue were prepared by diluting certain volumes of the stock solution
to obtain 5, 10, 15, 25, 30, 40, 75, and 150 ppm solutions. The adsorption
experiments were performed by adding 0.01 g of adsorbent into 25 mL
of MB solution placed in a glass batch reactor, and the circulated
water from a thermostatic bath maintained the temperature at 25 °C.
The removal efficiency was determined by withdrawing samples at certain
time intervals and analyzing them using a JASCO, V-730, UV–vis
spectrophotometer. The photocatalytic activity of the prepared materials
was tested under solar-simulated light (a xenon lamp reactor equipped
with a cooling system) at a wavelength of 300–800 nm.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Characterization of the Prepared Titanates
Figure 1 illustrates
the XRD patterns of the prepared Na-TNTs and metal-doped titanate
nanotubes. The patterns confirm the successful preparation of Na-TNTs
since four reflections at 2θ values of about 10, 24, 28, and
48° are the fingerprints of titanate nanotubes. All peaks were
compared and indexed to ICDD card no. 31-1329. The reflection close
to 10° is an evidence of the tubular structure, corresponding
to the (001) reflection, related to the interlayer distance between
sodium titanate multilayers. Figure 1 also reveals that after exchanging sodium ion of titanate
with different mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, and pentavalent cations the
plane (001) still exists in all samples. It means that the nanotubes
retained their structures regardless the cation valency. The change
of d-spacing value and the small shift of peak at
10.1°, as reported in Table 1, confirm that the Na+ ions were successfully
exchanged with different cations (Mg2+, Ca2+, Zn2+, K+, Cr3+, Ce3+, Ce4+, Mo5+, and La3+). In addition,
the alternation of intensities of peaks at 24 and 28° is another
evidence for the exchange process. It is worth mentioning that the
intensity of the peak at 28° significantly decreases in the case
of tetravalent (Ce) or pentavalent (Mo) cation doping.

and doped sodium titanate nanotubes.

3.2 Mechanism of Exchange
The Na2Ti3O7 crystal structure is composed
of edge-shared TiO6 octahedrons, arranged in a zigzag-like
pattern, where the sodium ions (Na+) locate between these
layers and bound to the oxygen anions in two different crystallographic
sites. In the first site, the Na+ cations are coordinated
with nine oxygen anions in an irregular polyhedron and the layers
carry exchangeable Na+ ions between them.21,23 This layered structure allows Na+ cations to be easily
exchanged with other cations, such as Mg2+, Ca2+, Zn2+, K+, Cr3+, Ce3+, Ce4+, Mo5+, and La3+ (used in
the current study). One of the amazing properties of Na2TinO2n+1 nanostructures
is their cationic-exchange ability.

Figures 2–11 show the SEM-EDXS and elemental mapping of Na-TNT to get
Mg-TNT, Ca-TNT, Zn-TNT, K-TNT, Cr-TNT, Ce(IV)-TNT, Ce(III)-TNT, Mo-TNT,
and La-TNT, respectively. It is clear from the EDXS spectra and their
data that the added amounts of metal cations were sufficient to replace
Na cations in all samples. These graphs also reveal that the exchange
of Na+ with Mg2+, Ca2+, Zn2+, K+, Cr3+, Ce3+, Ce4+, Mo5+, and La3+ does not affect the tubular
morphology of the as-prepared Na-titanate nanotubes, where it can
be noticed in all SEM images that the nanotubes are uniform in diameter
and different in length and are randomly oriented and cross-linked
to each other.

nanotubes.

The elemental maps illustrate the distribution
of atomic Ti, O,
Na, Mg, Ca, Zn, K, Cr, Ce, Ce, Mo, and La. The elemental mapping results
indicate that the Na cations were replaced uniformly with the other
cations since the uniform distribution of Mg, Ca, Zn, K, Cr, Ce, Ce,
Mo, and La can be observed in Figures 3–11, respectively. Small
peaks of Na can observed in the case of Cr and Ce3+ only,
which indicate incomplete exchange in both samples.

Figure 12 shows
the ζ-potential values of different doped titanate nanotubes
at pH 7. It is clear from the figure that all samples showed negative
(−ve) values except Ce(IV)-TNT, which showed a positive value
of 1 mV. The negative values are in accordance with other reports
about titanate nanotubes.25,26

as a function of dopant type.

Photoluminescence (PL) is used to characterize
in-depth the structure
and surface features of different nanoparticles because of their high
sensitivity and noninvasiveness.27 The
photoluminescence spectra are used to determine the activity of different
photocatalysts based on the rate of electron–hole pair recombination.28Figure 13 shows the PL spectra of Mg2+-, Ca2+-, Zn2+-, K+-, Cr3+-, Ce3+-, Ce4+-, Mo5+-, and La3+-doped
titanate nanotubes. The figure reveals that the recombination rates
of tri-, tetra-, and pentavalent-doped titanate nanotubes are lower
than those of mono- and divalent-doped nanotubes, and hence, they
will be more efficient in photocatalytic applications. All of the
samples show broad PL peaks and the maximum appears at the wavelength
around 528 nm.

3.3 Methyl Blue (MB) Adsorption on Doped Titanate
Nanotubes
Figure 14 shows the adsorption performance using different doped titanate
nanotubes, where C0 and Ct are the concentrations of MB at the initial condition
(t = 0 min) and at a given time t, respectively. It reveals that all samples have good affinity toward
MB adsorption except for using Ce(IV)-TNT. This is resulting from
positive charges on the surface of Ce(IV)-TNT, as shown in Figure 12, in contrast to
the other nine materials that are negatively charged and close to
each other in the ζ-potential values. These nine materials showed
high removal efficiency percentages but at different equilibrium times,
as shown in Figure 14, where Mg-TNT, Zn-TNT, and K-TNT showed higher MB removal percentages
(97%) after 45 min, while Ca-TNT, Cr-TNT, Ce(III)-TNT, Mo-TNT, La-TNT,
and Na-TNT showed removal efficiencies of 95, 84, 95, 96, 94, and
96% after 65, 1200, 120, 300, 180, and 105 min, respectively. Figure 14 reveals also that
all samples achieved high removal percentages after 15 min, when compared
with the removal percentages at the equilibrium. By comparing the d-spacing values in Table 1, ζ-potential values in Figure 12, and the MB removal performance in Figure 14, it was found
that no general trend can be adopted based on these values since the
highest d-spacing values of 9.1 Å did not show
the best removal performance. It was reported by Ferreira et al.29 that the exchange process does not significantly
affect the surface area of the nanotubes as they found in the case
of cobalt-exchanged titanate nanotubes. Based on these findings in
current and previous studies, it is clear that the adsorption percentage
varies from one sample to another based on the changes in some crystallographic
parameters and surface charges (Table 2).

3.4 Mechanism of MB Adsorption on Doped Titanate
Nanotubes
It is well known and reported that the adsorption
of MB molecules on titanate surfaces is mainly electrostatic since
the titanate surfaces are negatively charged and the MB dye molecules
are positively charged.25,26 Recently, Ferreira
et al.29 found that the capacity of dye
adsorption of titanates nanotubes is significantly affected by metal
doping; they demonstrated that MB molecules are adsorbed on the titanate
surface and in the interlayer spaces and the adsorption is affected
by the change of titanate d-spacing values and surface
reactivity. Our results are in accordance with these findings. As
shown in Figure 15, MB molecules can be adsorbed on the titanate surface in two ways,
parallel and perpendicular to the surface, since the dimension of
MB molecule is about 1.43 nm × 0.60 nm and the average d-spacing of all samples is about 0.85 nm, so the dye molecules
can be introduced into the interlayer spacing that is negatively charged
and contains exchangeable sodium ions. This involvement of internal
cavities in the adsorption process increases significantly the adsorption
capacity of titanate nanotubes. Ferreira et al.29 also found that the existence of the dyes molecules in-between
the titanate layers caused a valuable sensitization for the Co-doped
titanate nanotubes. This sensitization process shifted the doped titanate
nanotubes to the visible region of absorption.

Figure 15 Mechanism of MB (positively
charged) adsorption onto the titanate
nanotubes surface (negatively charged).

3.5 Adsorption Isotherms
The adsorptive
behavior of MB onto Mg-TNT was studied using two common models, Langmuir
and Freundlich isotherm models.

In the Langmuir isotherm model,
it is assumed that the adsorption takes place on a homogeneous surface,
resulting in the formation of a monolayer of the adsorbate. On the
other hand, it is assumed in the Freundlich model that the adsorption
process occurs on the heterogeneous surface, where the active sites
on the adsorbents are not equal.

The linear forms of Langmuir
and Freundlich models are illustrated
in eqs 1 and 2, respectively. 1   2  The values of adsorption parameters obtained
from the linear fitting of Langmuir and Freundlich models are listed
and explained in Table 3. The results revealed that Langmuir is best fitted to adsorption
data. The regression coefficient, R2,
for both models is 1, but RL (RL = 1/1 + KLC0) value obtained based on Langmuir isotherm
fitting is found to be 0.985, which indicates favorable adsorption.
While in the case of the Freundlich model, the value of 1/n was found to be >0.5, which indicates unfavorable adsorption.
The maximum adsorption capacity (Qmax)
calculated from the experimental results was found to be 105 mg/g.
This result was compared with the most recently published works, and
this comparison is tabulated in Table 4.

3.6 Photocatalytic Activity of Doped Titanate
It was found that after 2 h of solar-simulated light irradiation
the removal trend is approximately the same as for the sample left
in the dark for adsorption. By increasing the adsorption and photocatalysis
time to 24 h, the trend stayed the same with more that 90% removal
of MB, in most cases. This high and fast adsorption performance of
titanate to MB hindered the degradation monitoring using a UV–vis
spectrophotometer since the dye was totally adsorbed on the titanate
surface, leaving the solution colorless as shown in Figure 16. By increasing the irradiation
time to 36 h, the colored Mg-TNT catalyst returns to its original
color. Based on this observation, this photocatalytic process can
be used to regenerate the titanate after the adsorption process to
be used in many consecutive times.

The band gaps of all samples were calculated using
the Tauc plot
as shown in Figure 17a–i and are illustrated in Table 5.

Figure 17 (a–i) Tauc’s plots for all samples.
The optical band
gap energies were estimated by extrapolating the linear portion of
the curve to zero absorption.

Ce(IV)-TNT	2.02	
Ce(III)-TNT	2.46	
Mo(V)-TNT	2.36

The results showed that the prepared samples revealed
band gaps
in the range of 2.02–2.8, which enable their use as photocatalysts
under the irradiation of solar or visible light to decompose the targeted
organic compounds.

3.7 Band Edge Calculations
The conduction
band and valence band potentials were calculated33−37 using the following equations      

where ECB is the conduction band potential; EVB is the valence band potential; χ is the electronegativity
for the elements, which is calculated from the ionization energy and
electron affinity data; and a, b, and c are the numbers of atoms of A, B, and C, respectively.

The calculated data are presented in Figure 18; the figure reveals that five of the nine
samples in this study show valence band and conduction band potentials
that may be used in photocatalytic water splitting and these samples
are K-TNT (monovalent), Ca-TNT 9 (divalent), Ce(III)-TNT, Ce(IV)-TNT
(tetravalent), and La(III)-TNT (trivalent).

4 Conclusions
Titanate nanotubes were
prepared and doped with mono-, di-, tri,
tetra-, and pentavalent cations by a simple scalable method. The results
showed variation in the result of adsorptivity of the doped titanate
nanotubes. The results of this study enable the researchers to tune
the activity of the sodium titanate nanotubes based on the dopant
valency and type. Also, the result revealed that all materials except
Ce(IV)-TNT can be used in efficient removal of MB via an adsorption
process. The band edges of all samples were calculated, and theoretically,
K-TNT (monovalent), Ca-TNT (divalent), Ce(III)-TNT, Ce(IV)-TNT (tetravalent),
and La(III)-TNT (trivalent) could be used in photocatalytic water
splitting.
