Multidrug
membrane transporters (efflux pumps) are responsible
for multidrug resistance (MDR) and the low efficacy of therapeutic
drugs. Noble metal nanoparticles (NPs) possess a high surface-area-to-volume
ratio and size-dependent plasmonic optical properties, enabling them
to serve both as imaging probes to study sized-dependent MDR and as
potential drug carriers to circumvent MDR and enhance therapeutic
efficacy. To this end, in this study, we synthesized three different
sizes of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs), 2.4 ± 0.7, 13.0 ±
3.1, and 92.6 ± 4.4 nm, functionalized their surface with a monolayer
of 11-amino-1-undecanethiol (AUT), and covalently conjugated them
with antibiotics (ofloxacin, Oflx) to prepare antibiotic drug nanocarriers
with conjugation ratios of 8.6 × 102, 9.4 × 103, and 6.5 × 105 Oflx molecules per NP, respectively.
We purified and characterized the nanocarriers and developed cell
culture medium in which the cells grew normally and the nanocarriers
were stable (non-aggregated), to quantitatively study the size, dose,
and efflux pump (MexAB-OprM) dependent inhibitory effect of the nanocarriers
against two strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, WT (normal expression of MexAB-OprM) and ΔABM (deletion of
MexAB-OprM). We found that the inhibitory effect of these nanocarriers
highly depended on the sizes of NPs, the doses of antibiotic, and
the expression of MexAB-OprM. The same amount of Oflx on the largest
nanocarriers (92.6 ± 4.4 nm) showed the highest inhibitory effect
(the lowest minimal inhibitory concentration) against P. aeruginosa. Surprisingly, the smallest nanocarriers
(2.4 ± 0.7 nm) exhibited a lower inhibitory effect than free
Oflx. The results suggest that size-dependent multivalent effects,
the distribution and localization of Oflx (pharmacodynamics), and
the efflux of Oflx all play a role in the inhibitory effects. Control
experiments using three sizes of AgMUNH2 NPs (absence of
Oflx) showed that these NPs do not exhibit any significant inhibitory
activity toward both strains. These new findings demonstrate the need
for and possibility of designing optimal sized antibiotic nanocarriers
to achieve the highest efficacy against P. aeruginosa.

==== Body
Introduction
All living organisms
are equipped with multi-substrate extrusion
systems (membrane transporters or efflux pumps) to selectively extrude
a wide range of substrates out of live cells.1,2 Such
self-protective efflux machinery resists the accumulation of structurally
and functionally unrelated noxious compounds inside the cells and
causes multidrug resistance (MDR) and low efficacy of therapeutic
drugs (e.g., antibiotics).3−7 MDR is responsible for the creation of superbugs and the urgent
need to develop new classes of antibiotics against bacterial pathogens.7,8 Multidrug membrane transporters have been identified as targets
to increase the efficacy of therapeutic drugs and the effectiveness
of treatment.7−9 However, despite extensive studies over decades,
the molecular mechanisms of MDR and the efflux functions of multidrug
membrane transporters remain elusive.4,7,8,10,11

Pseudomonas aeruginosa (a ubiquitous
Gram-negative bacterium) has become one of the major opportunistic
human pathogens and a leading cause of nosocomial infections.10,12−15P. aeruginosa possesses several multidrug
membrane transporters (efflux pumps).16−20 These multidrug membrane transporters can selectively
extrude a wide variety of structurally and functionally unrelated
antibiotics out of the bacterial cells, which causes MDR and difficulty
in treating infections.4,10,11,20,21 For example,
MexAB-OprM is the primary membrane transporter found in wild-type
(WT) P. aeruginosa, and it consists
of two inner membrane proteins (MexA and MexB) and one outer membrane
protein (OprM).22−24 The MexAB-OprM transporter of P. aeruginosa can extrude an array of antibiotics (e.g., ofloxacin, azthreonam,
chloramphenicol, and gentamicin) out of these cells, leading to a
lower accumulation of antibiotics inside the cells and a higher minimal
inhibitory concentration (MIC) against P. aeruginosa.25 Notably, the sizes, structures, and
chemical properties of antibiotics (pump substrates) vary drastically.

Nanomaterials possess distinctive physiochemical properties, such
as high surface-to-volume ratios and small sizes. Studies have shown
that these distinctive properties could enable nanomaterials to serve
as drug carriers to increase the payload of therapeutic agents and
hence enhance the efficacy of localization for targeted therapy.26−28 However, systematic and quantitative studies of the dependence of
efficacy of drug nanocarrier on their physicochemical properties (e.g.,
sizes) and their underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unexplored.
Furthermore, it remains very challenging to characterize the physicochemical
properties of individual nanocarriers in situ in
real time at single NP resolution. Moreover, current studies have
primarily focused on polymer-based nanocarriers (e.g., vesicles) for
treating eukaryotic cells, with only few studies examining noble metal
NP-based antibiotic nanocarriers for inhibiting the growth of bacteria.26−29

Noble metal NPs (e.g., Ag NPs) exhibit sized-dependent plasmonic
optical properties, exceptionally high Rayleigh scattering, and photostability
(non-photobleaching and nonblinking).29−36 We have directly imaged and characterized single noble metal NPs
(Ag or Au NPs) in situ in real time using dark-field
optical microscopy and spectroscopy (DFOMS).34,35,37−39 We have used size-dependent
localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) spectra of single NPs to
determine the sizes of individual NPs in solution, single live cells,
and embryos in situ in real time, and we have directly
measured the sizes of single NPs as they are transported in and out
of single live cells in real time.29,32−36,40−43 We have demonstrated that Ag
and Au NPs can serve as photostable nanophotonic optical probes for
sensing and imaging single molecules and dynamics events of interest
in single live cells and embryos over time.34,36−41,43−47 For instance, we have used the intrinsic optical
properties of single Ag and Au NPs to study the size-dependent transport
dynamics of single membrane transporters and the size-dependent permeability
of cellular membranes of single live cells induced by antibiotics
(e.g., aztreonam, chloramphenicol) at nanometer spatial resolution
and millisecond temporal resolution.36,40,41,43

In this study,
we synthesized, purified, and characterized three
different sizes of Ag NP-based antibiotic nanocarriers (2.4 ±
0.7, 13.0 ± 3.1, and 92.6 ± 4.4 nm). We quantitatively studied
the size, dose, and efflux pump (MexAB-OprM) dependent inhibitory
effects (susceptibility) of the nanocarriers against two strains of P. aeruginosa, WT (normal expression of MexAB-OprM)
and ΔABM (deletion of MexAB-OprM), aiming to study not only
the dependence of the therapeutic effects of antibiotics on the sizes
of the nanocarriers but also the dependence of the efflux function
of the MexAB-OprM multidrug membrane transporter of P. aeruginosa on the sizes of the nanocarriers. We
used single Ag NPs both as antibiotic nanocarriers and as imaging
probes to study their MDR dependent therapeutic effects, aiming to
rationally design nanocarriers that not only can increase the local
payload of therapeutic agents to target bacteria, but also can evade
multidrug efflux pumps and circumvent MDR, thus achieving higher efficacy
and lower therapeutic side effects. To our knowledge, drug nanocarriers
have not yet been reported for the study of MDR and the efflux function
of a multidrug membrane transporter in bacteria.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
and Characterization of Three Different Sized Ag NPs
We synthesized
and purified three different sized Ag NPs, as described
in Materials and Methods and as reported previously
by us.32,37,38,47,48 Representative TEM
images (Figure 1A:
a–c) and histograms of size distribution (Figure 1B: a–c) of the three
different NP samples show nearly spherical shaped NPs with diameters
of 2.4 ± 0.7, 13.0 ± 3.1, and 92.6 ± 4.4 nm, respectively.
Notably, the shapes of the smallest NPs are the closest to spherical.
In contrast, the shapes of the largest NPs are polygonal (the least
spherical). The diameters of oval and irregular shaped NPs were determined
by averaging the length and width of the NPs.

Figure 1 Characterization of sizes,
shapes, and plasmonic optical properties
of three different sized Ag NPs. (A) HRTEM images of single Ag NPs
and (B) histograms of their size distributions show nearly spherical
shaped NPs with average diameters of (a) 2.4 ± 0.7, (b) 13.0
± 3.1, and (c) 92.6 ± 4.4 nm. (C) UV–vis absorption
spectra of the NPs in DI water show the peak absorption (full width
at half-maximum), λmax (fwhm), at (a) 392 (57), (b)
395 (59), and (c) 450 nm with a shoulder peak of 390 nm, respectively.

We characterized the plasmonic
absorption and scattering of Ag
NP solutions using UV–vis absorption spectroscopy. UV–vis
absorption spectra of three different sized NPs with diameters of
2.4 ± 0.7, 13.0 ± 3.1, and 92.6 ± 4.4 nm show that
their peak wavelengths with full width at half-maximum, λmax (fwhm), are 392 (57), 395 (59), and 450 (182) nm, respectively.
We did not observe any shoulder peak for NPs with diameters of either
2.4 ± 0.7 or 13.0 ± 3.1 nm, further demonstrating that they
are nearly spherical. In contrast, we observed one shoulder peak at
390 nm for the 92.6 ± 4.4 nm diameter NPs, which is most likely
attributed to the in-plane quadrupole resonance of the NPs generated
by transverse collective oscillation of the surface electrons between
the edges of the NPs. Notably, the TEM images of the NPs (Figure 1A: c) indeed show
that they are polygonal with sharp edges.

Synthesis and Characterization
of Antibiotic Nanocarriers (AgMUNH-Oflx
NPs)
We functionalized the well purified and characterized
Ag NPs with a monolayer of 11-amino-1-undecanethiol (AUT) by replacing
the citrate molecules electrostatically adsorbed on the surface of
the NPs with AUT via the interaction of thiol groups of AUT with the
NPs to prepare AgMUNH2 NPs, as presented in the Materials and Methods and Figure 2. We washed the AgMUNH2 NPs thoroughly
with nanopure water to remove excess AUT using centrifugation. We
then covalently conjugated the amine groups of each size of AgMUNH2 NPs with the carboxyl group of ofloxacin (Oflx) via a peptide
bond using a two-step method with EDC and sulfo-NHS as mediators to
prepare antibiotic nanocarriers (AgMUNH-Oflx NPs), as illustrated
in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Schematic illustration
of synthesis of three different sized antibiotic
nanocarriers. The surfaces of (A) 2.4 ± 0.7, (B) 13.0 ±
3.1 and (C) 92.6 ± 4.4 nm Ag NPs were functionalized with a monolayer
of AUT using the interaction of the thiol groups (−SH) of AUT
with the surface of Ag NPs to prepare AgMUNH2 NPs. The
amine group of AUT attached onto the surface of Ag NPs was then conjugated
with the carboxyl group of the Oflx via a peptide bond using EDC and
sulfo-NHS as mediators to prepare AgMUNH-Oflx NPs (antibiotic nanocarriers).

We purified the drug nanocarriers
(AgMUNH-Oflx NPs) by thoroughly
washing them with deionized (DI) water, and we characterized the conjugation
ratios of Oflx molecules to the NPs using UV–vis absorption
spectroscopy, as shown in Figure 3 and Table 1. The absorption spectrum of 2.4 ± 0.7 nm Ag NPs (Figure 3A: a) shows a plasmonic
absorption peak wavelength of 390 nm with a fwhm of 55 nm. After the
surface of the NPs was functionalized with a monolayer of AUT, the
refractivity of the NPs decreased and their dielectric constant increased,
leading to a red-shifted and broader plasmonic absorption spectrum.
Thus, the plasmonic absorption spectrum of AgMUNH2 NPs
(Figure 3A: b) shows
a peak wavelength of 413 nm and a fwhm of 132 nm. Upon conjugation
of Oflx with the AgMUNH2 NPs, we observed both the distinctive
absorption peak wavelengths of Oflx at 288 and 331 nm and the plasmonic
peak absorption of the NPs at 416 nm for the nanocarriers (AgMUNH-Oflx
NPs). We subtracted the absorption spectrum of AgMUNH2 NPs
from that of AgMUNH-Oflx NPs and determined the concentration of Oflx
covalently attached onto the nanocarriers using the absorbance at
288 nm. We used the plasmonic peak absorbance of NPs in the same nanocarriers
to determine the concentration of NPs. We divided the Oflx concentration
of the nanocarrier by the NP concentration of the same nanocarrier
solution to quantitatively characterize the conjugation ratio of Oflx
molecules to NPs, showing 8.6 × 102 Oflx molecules/NP
for the 2.4 ± 0.7 nm Ag NPs. Using a close-packed model with
the footprint of each AUT molecule of 0.214 × 0.214 nm2 on the surface of the NP,38 we found
that the smooth surface area of a perfectly spherical NP with a diameter
of 2.4 nm could only accommodate 395 Oflx molecules/NP. The 2-fold
higher payload of 8.6 × 102 Oflx molecules/NP could
be attributed to the rough surface and irregular shape of the NPs.

for three different sized Ag NPs using UV–vis absorption spectroscopy.
(A) UV–vis absorption spectra of (a) 2.4 ± 0.7 nm Ag NPs,
(b) AgMUNH2 NPs, and (c) AgMUNH-Oflx NPs show plasmonic
absorption peak wavelengths (λmax) of the NPs at
392, 413, and 416 nm, respectively. (B) UV–vis absorption spectra
of (a) 13.0 ± 3.1 nm Ag NPs, (b) AgMUNH2 NPs, and
(c) AgMUNH-Oflx NPs show plasmonic absorption λmax of the NPs at 394, 414, and 418 nm, respectively. (C) UV–vis
absorption spectra of (a) 92.6 ± 4.4 nm Ag NPs, (b) AgMUNH2 NPs, and (c) AgMUNH-Oflx NPs show plasmonic absorption λmax of the NPs at 450, 453, and 486 nm, respectively. Note
that signature absorption λmax of Oflx at 288 and
331 nm were observed only in (c) for the three sized nanocarriers,
showing the conjugation of Oflx with the NPs.

a Plasmonic absorbance of the drug
nanocarriers (AgMUNH-Oflx NPs) at λmax of 416, 418,
and 486 nm was used to determine the concentration of the 2.4 ±
0.7, 13.0 ± 3.1, and 92.6 ± 4.4 nm NPs, respectively.

b COflx was determined by subtracting the UV–vis absorption spectra
of AgMUNH2 NPs from that of AgMUNH-Oflx NPs and dividing
the peak absorbance of the subtracted UV–vis spectra at 288
nm by the molar absorptivity (ε288nm) of Oflx, 7.8
× 103 M–1 cm–1.

c Conjugation ratio of
the number
of Oflx molecules per NP was calculated by dividing the concentration
of Oflx by the concentration of NPs for the same solution of AgMUNH-Oflx
NPs for the 2.4 ± 0.7, 13.0 ± 3.1, and 92.6 ± 4.4 nm
NPs, respectively.

The absorption
spectrum of the 13.0 ± 3.1 nm Ag NPs (Figure 3B: a) shows a plasmonic
absorption peak wavelength at 399 nm and a fwhm of 58 nm. After their
surface was functionalized with a monolayer of AUT, their plasmonic
absorption spectrum (Figure 3B: b) red-shifted and showed a peak wavelength of 413 nm and
a fwhm of 132 nm. After the AgMUNH2 NPs were conjugated
with Oflx, the plasmonic absorption spectrum of AgMUNH-Oflx NPs (nanocarriers)
exhibited both the distinctive absorption peak wavelengths of Oflx
at 288 and 331 nm as well as the plasmonic peak absorption of NPs
at 418 nm for the nanocarriers (AgMUNH-Oflx NPs). Using the same approaches
as described above, we quantitatively characterized the conjugation
ratio of Oflx molecules to NPs as 9.4 × 103 Oflx molecules/NP
for the 13.0 ± 3.1 nm NPs, which is nearly equal to the maximum
number of AUT molecules (1.2 × 104 molecules) that
could be closely packed on the surface of a spherical NP with a diameter
of 13 nm, as determined by the close-packed model.

The absorption
spectrum of the 92.6 ± 4.4 nm Ag NPs (Figure 3C: a) shows a plasmonic
absorption peak wavelength at 450 nm. After their surface was functionalized
with a monolayer of AUT, the peak wavelength of the plasmonic absorption
spectrum red-shifted to 453 nm (Figure 3C: b). Upon conjugation of the AgMUNH2 NPs
with Oflx, the plasmonic absorption spectrum of AgMUNH-Oflx NPs exhibited
both the distinctive absorption peak wavelengths of Oflx at 288 and
331 nm as well as a further red-shifted plasmonic peak absorption
of the NPs to 500 nm. Using the same approaches described above, we
quantitatively characterized the conjugation ratio of Oflx to the
NPs as 6.5 × 105 Oflx molecules/NP for the 92.6 ±
4.4 nm NPs, which is approximately equal to the maximum number of
AUT molecules (5.9 × 105 molecules) that could be
closely packed on the surface of a perfectly spherical NP with a diameter
of 92.6 nm, as determined by the close-packed model.

Stability of
Drug Nanocarriers (AgMUNH-Oflx NPs) in Cell Culture
Medium
In order to study the dependence of the inhibitory
effects of these antibiotic nanocarriers against P.
aeruginosa on the sizes of NPs and doses of antibiotic,
it is crucial that the nanocarriers remain stable (non-aggregated)
in cell culture medium and that their sizes and doses remain unchanged
over the entire duration of the cell culture experiment. If the nanocarriers
aggregate in the cell culture medium, then their sizes and doses would
change over time, making a study of their size and dose dependent
inhibitory effects unreliable.

Therefore, we first characterized
the stability (non-aggregation) of each size of drug nanocarriers
(AgMUNH-Oflx NPs) in a commonly used standard LB medium (1% tryptone,
0.5% yeast extract, and 0.5% NaCl in DI water, pH = 7.2) over 24 h
using UV–vis absorption spectra. Unfortunately, none of the
nanocarriers at the desired concentration were stable in this standard
medium.

We then reduced the concentration of NaCl to 0.1% and
characterized
the stability (non-aggregation) of the drug nanocarriers in the modified
medium (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, and 0.1% NaCl in DI water,
pH = 7.2) over 24 h using UV–vis absorption spectroscopy. The
results in Figure 4 show that the absorption spectra of the nanocarriers remain unchanged
over 24 h, indicating that the nanocarriers with Ag NP diameters of
2.4 ± 0.7, 13.0 ± 3.1, and 92.6 ± 4.4 nm and concentrations
of 6.0 nM, 0.8 nM, and 7 pM were stable (non-aggregated) in the modified
medium over 24 h, respectively.

Figure 4 Characterization of the stability (non-aggregation)
of three sized
antibiotic nanocarriers (AgMUNH-Oflx NPs) in the modified LB medium
using UV–vis absorption spectroscopy. The UV–vis absorption
spectra of 6 nM, 0.8 nM, and 7 pM AgMUNH-Oflx NPs for the Ag NPs with
diameters of (A) 2.4 ± 0.7, (B) 13.0 ± 3.1, and (C) 92.6
± 4.4 nm in the modified LB medium at (a) 0 and (b) 24 h remain
essentially unchanged over time, which indicates that the nanocarriers
are stable (non-aggregated) in this medium over 24 h.

Suitability of the Modified LB Medium for
Cell Culture
To ensure that the modified cell culture medium
is well suited for
culturing healthy cells as their standard cell culture medium, we
pre-cultured the cells (WT, ΔABM, and nalB-1) in the standard
medium for 12 h. We then cultured the pre-cultured cells in the standard
medium and the modified medium and measured the growth curves of the
cells over time. The results show that the growth curves of the cells
cultured in the standard medium (Figure S1-a) and the modified medium (Figure S1-b) are the same, which demonstrates that the modified medium is well
suited for culturing these cells.

We further characterized the
viability of the cells that had been cultured in the standard and
modified medium over 12 h using live/dead BacLight
assay. Representative optical and fluorescence images of the cultured
cells show that more than 99% of the cells cultured in the standard
and modified LB medium over time exhibit SYTO9 green fluorescence
and they are viable (Figure S2). The results
further demonstrate that the modified medium can be used to replace
the standard medium to culture these cells.

Moreover, we characterized
the efflux function of MexAB-OprM by
probing the MexAB-OprM dependent accumulation kinetics of intracellular
ethidium bromide (EtBr) in live cells (WT, ΔABM, and nalB-1).
The experiments were conducted in parallel. EtBr shows a low fluorescence
intensity outside the cells. As EtBr enters the cells and intercalates
with DNA, its fluorescence intensity increases ∼10 times.49 Thus, the fluorescence intensity of EtBr has
been widely used to characterize the efflux function of multidrug
membrane transporters in live cells in real time using fluorescence
spectroscopy.33,45,50−54 The results in Figure S3 show that the
fluorescence intensity of EtBr incubated with ΔABM cells (deletion
of MexAB-OprM) rapidly increases with time (Figure S3-a), whereas the fluorescence intensity of EtBr incubated
with WT cells (normal expression of MexAB-OprM) increases slightly
over time (Figure S3-b) and the fluorescence
intensity of EtBr incubated with nalB-1 cells (overexpression of MexAB-OprM)
remains essentially unchanged over time (Figure S3-c). These results show the high dependence of the accumulation
kinetics of intracellular EtBr on the expression level of MexAB-OprM.
The cells (ΔABM) with deletion of MexAB-OprM exhibit the highest
accumulation rate of intracellular EtBr, and the cells (nalB-1) with
over-expression of MexAB-OprM show the lowest accumulation rate of
intracellular EtBr, indicating that MexAB-OprM extrudes EtBr out of
the cells, which leads to the lowest accumulation of intracellular
EtBr in nalB-1 cells. The accumulation rate of EtBr incubated with
cells cultured in either the standard medium (Figure S3-A) or the modified medium (Figure S3-B) is the same, further demonstrating that the modified
medium is well suited to culture healthy cells with a fully functioning
efflux pump (MexAB-OprM).

Dose, Size, and MexAB-OprM Dependent Inhibitory
Effects of Drug
Nanocarriers (AgMUNH-Oflx NPs)
We cultured the cells (WT
or ΔABM) in the modified medium containing a dilution series
of Oflx alone, each given sized drug nanocarrier (AgMUNH-Oflx NPs),
and AgMUNH2 NPs (absence of Oflx, control experiments)
by inoculating 104 pre-cultured cells into the medium and
vigorously shaking the solution (200 rpm, 37 °C) over 17 h.

The dilution series contains 0, 0.20, 0.40, 0.60, 0.80, 1.08, 1.62,
and 2.16 μM free Oflx (Figure 5A) or Oflx conjugated with the NPs (AgMUNH-Oflx NPs)
for WT cells (Figure 5B–D: b–h), which is correlated with the concentration
of the nanocarrier (NP concentration) as follows: (Figure 5B: b–h) 0.23, 0.463,
0.695, 0.917, 1.25, 1.88, and 2.50 nM for 2.4 ± 0.7 nm NPs with

ratio of 9.4 × 103 Oflx molecules per NP; and (Figure 5D: b–h) 0.309,
0.618, 0.926, 1.24, 1.67, 2.50, and 3.34 pM for 92.6 ± 4.4 nm
NPs with a conjugation ratio of 6.5 × 105 Oflx molecules
per NP. The control experiments include the medium alone (absence
of cells, Figure 5A–D:
a) and WT cells cultured under the same conditions and at the same
time in the medium containing 2.50 nM, 0.229 nM, or 3.34 pM AgMUNH2 NPs (in the absence of Oflx, Figure 5B–D: i) for the 2.4 ± 0.7, 13.0
± 3.1, or 92.6 ± 4.4 nm NPs, respectively.

for 2.4 ± 0.7 nm NPs with a conjugation ratio of 8.6 × 102 Oflx molecules per NP; (Figure 5G: k–q) 2.12 × 10–3, 4.24 × 10–3, 6.36 × 10–3, 8.48 × 10–3, 1.48 × 10–2, and 2.97 × 10–2 nM for 13.0 ± 3.1 nm
NPs with a conjugation ratio of 9.4 × 103 Oflx molecules
per NP; and (Figure 5H: k–q) 3.09 × 10–2, 6.18 × 10–2, 9.26 × 10–2, 0.124, 0.170,
0.216, and 0.432 pM for 92.6 ± 4.4 nm NPs with a conjugation
ratio of 6.5 × 105 Oflx molecules per NP. The control
experiments include the medium alone (absence of cells, Figure 5E–H: j) and ΔABM
cells cultured under the same conditions and at the same time in the
medium containing 0.324 nM, 2.97 × 10–2 nM,
or 0.432 pM AgMUNH2 NPs (in the absence of Oflx, Figure 5E–H: r) for
the 2.4 ± 0.7, 13.0 ± 3.1, or 92.6 ± 4.4 nm NPs, respectively.

We sampled the cell culture suspension every 6 h and quantitatively
determined the cell concentration by measuring their OD600 nm (optical density at 600 nm). For the cell suspensions with nanocarriers
or NPs, we subtracted the OD600 nm of the nanocarriers
or NPs in the medium (in the absence of the cells) from the OD600 nm of the cell suspension with the nanocarriers or NPs
to determine the cell concentration, respectively. We plotted the
OD600 nm of the cell suspension over time and determined
17 h to be the duration that is needed for the cell grown in the medium
alone (control) to reach confluence and for the cells grown in the
medium with Oflx, drug nanocarriers or NPs to reach equilibrium. We
then plotted the OD600 nm of the cell suspension at 17
h versus the concentration of Oflx alone or Oflx conjugated with the
given sized drug nanocarriers to determine the MIC of Oflx and Oflx
nanocarriers for each cell strain.

Plots of the OD600 nm of the cell suspension cultured
over 17 h versus the concentration of Oflx alone or Oflx conjugated
with the given sized drug nanocarriers in Figure 6 show that the inhibitory effects of Oflx
highly depend on the dose of Oflx, the sizes of the nanocarriers,
and the cellular expression of MexAB-OprM, as described below.

and MexAB-OprM dependent inhibitory effects of antibiotic

Oflx conjugated with the (e) 2.4 ± 0.7, (f) 13.0 ± 3.1,
and (g) 92.6 ± 4.4 nm Ag NPs, respectively. The concentration
of AgMUNH2 NPs in (a–c) of (A) and (B) contain the
same concentration of NPs as the nanocarriers with the highest Oflx
concentrations in (e–g) for each type of NP in (A) and (B)
but without carrying Oflx (control experiments for the study of effects
of NPs). The points are experimental data, and a solid line was generated
by fitting the experimental data with the equation y = a·e–bx as followings: (A): (d) y = 1.12·e–1.18x, R2 = 0.923; (e) y = 1.07·e–0.764x, R2 = 0.967; (f) y =
1.04·e–1.82x, R2 = 0.964; (g) y = 0.998·e–6.07x, R2 = 0.997. (B): (d) y = 1.12·e–8.59x, R2 = 0.892; (e) y =
0.984·e–3.58x, R2 = 0.938; (f) y = 1.13·e–11.35x, R2 = 0.920; (g) y = 0.997·e–68.82x, R2 = 0.989. Concentrations of Oflx
(MIC, IC50) for free Oflx and Oflx conjugated on a given
sized nanocarrier were determined using the exponential fitting equation
at the half of the maximum of the normalized OD600 nm for
each curve, respectively.

Control experiments in Figure 6 (a–c) show that the OD600 nm of
the cell suspension incubated with each of three different sized AgMUNH2 NPs (absence of Oflx, 2.4 ± 0.7, 13.0 ± 3.1, or
92.6 ± 4.4 nm), which has the same concentration of NPs as those
of the highest concentration of the given sized nanocarriers, are
nearly the same as those cultured in the medium alone. This result
indicates that the AgMUNH2 NPs at the given concentration
do not create significant inhibitory effects on the growth of WT and
ΔABM cells.

In contrast, the OD600 nm of the
cell suspension incubated
with Oflx alone shows a high dose dependent inhibitory effect of Oflx
on the growth of WT and ΔABM cells (Figure 6A,B: d). As the Oflx concentration increases,
the OD600 nm of the cell suspension (the number of the
cells) decreases. By fitting the plots, we found that the growth of
WT and ΔABM cells was reduced to half at Oflx concentrations
of 0.59 ± 0.16 and 0.096 ± 0.021 μM (Figure 6A,B: d), respectively. The
results show that the inhibitory effects are highly dependent on the
expression of MexAB-OprM. Here, we define the MIC of Oflx as the concentration
of Oflx needed to reduce the growth of the cells by half. The MIC
of Oflx for WT (normal expression of MexAB-OprM) is about 6 times
higher than that for ΔABM (deletion of MexAB-OprM), suggesting
that MexAB-OprM extrudes Oflx out of WT cells. Thus, a higher concentration
of Oflx is needed to eradicate the WT cells than that needed for ΔABM
cells. In contrast, ΔABM cells do not possess MexAB-OprM and
cannot effectively extrude Oflx out of the cells, which leads to a
higher accumulation of Oflx inside the ΔABM cells than that
in WT cells. Thus, a lower Oflx concentration is needed to eradicate
ΔABM cells compared to that for WT cells, which agrees with
previous reports.55

Plots of OD600 nm of the cell suspension cultured with
drug nanocarriers versus the concentration of Oflx conjugated with
each given sized AgMUNH2 NPs (2.4 ± 0.7, 13.0 ±
3.1, or 92.6 ± 4.4 nm) also show high dose and MexAB-OprM dependent
inhibitory effects on the growth of WT and ΔABM cells (Figure 6A,B: e–g).
This result suggests that MexAB-OprM can extrude the drug nanocarriers
out of the WT cells, which reduces the amount of intracellular Oflx
nanocarriers in WT cells and leads to a higher MIC for WT cells than
that for ΔABM cells.

Interestingly, the OD600 nm of the cell suspension incubated
with the 2.4 ± 0.7 nm drug nanocarriers with a conjugation ratio
of 8.6 × 102 Oflx molecules/NP decrease with Oflx
concentration less rapidly than those of free Oflx and the two other
larger nanocarriers (Figure 6A,B: e), showing MICs of 1.00 ± 0.07 and 0.19 ±
0.05 μM Oflx for the WT and ΔABM cells, which is the highest
among the nanocarriers and free Oflx (Table 2).

a The MIC of Oflx
for each sample
was determined by fitting the experimental data with the exponential
decay equation (y = a·e–bx, inhibitory effects upon exponential
cell growth) to determine the parameters (a and b) of a fitting equation with a regression. The equation
was then used to determine the concentration of Oflx at which the
cell growth was inhibited to half of the cell growth of the blank
control experiment, as described in the caption of Figure 6.

Notably, the MICs of the 13.0 ± 3.1 nm drug nanocarriers
with
a conjugation ratio of 9.6 × 103 Oflx molecules/NP
are 0.40 ± 0.06 and 0.073 ± 0.012 μM for the WT and
ΔABM cells, respectively (Figure 6A,B: f), which is lower than the MICs of free Oflx
and the 2.4 ± 0.7 nm drug nanocarriers. Furthermore, the MICs
of the 92.6 ± 4.4 nm drug nanocarriers with a conjugation ratio
of 6.5 × 105 Oflx molecules/NP are 0.11 ± 0.01
and 0.010 ± 0.001 μM for the WT and ΔABM cells, respectively
(Figure 6A,B: g), showing
the lowest MIC and the highest inhibitory effects among the nanocarriers
and free Oflx. The results show that the inhibitory effects of Oflx
are highly dependent on the dose of Oflx, the size of the nanocarrier,
and the cellular expression of MexAB-OprM. For the same amount of
Oflx against WT and ΔABM cells, the Oflx molecules carried and
delivered by the largest NPs (92.6 ± 4.4 nm) are the most potent,
followed by the 13.0 ± 3.1 nm nanocarriers, free Oflx, and the
2.4 ± 0.7 nm nanocarriers (Table 2).

For ΔABM cells (absence of MexAB-OprM),
the MICs of Oflx
conjugated on the 13.0 ± 3.1 and 92.6 ± 4.4 nm nanocarriers
are 2.6 and 19 times lower than that of Oflx conjugated on the smallest
nanocarriers (2.4 ± 0.7 nm). In other words, the same amount
of Oflx is the most potent when it is delivered into the cells using
the largest nanocarriers (92.6 ± 4.4 nm) and vice versa, suggesting
that densely packed Oflx on larger nanocarriers could offer a higher
binding affinity with the target (multivalent effect) and a higher
local drug dose for binding with the target compared to those of Oflx
molecules conjugated on the smaller nanocarriers. Interestingly, the
MIC of free Oflx against the ΔABM cells is only half of the
MIC of Oflx on the 2.4 ± 0.7 nm nanocarriers, but it is nearly
the same as that of Oflx on the 13.0 ± 3.1 nm nanocarriers and
almost 10 times higher than that of Oflx on the 92.6 ± 4.4 nm
nanocarriers. In other words, the inhibitory effects of the drug nanocarriers
depend on their sizes, but they are not linearly proportional to their
sizes, which suggests that the distribution of the same amount of
the drug throughout the cells (pharmacodynamics) versus the localization
of the same drug dose on individual nanocarriers (high affinity) could
play roles that trade off with regard to their inhibitory effects.
Free Oflx and smaller nanocarriers diffuse faster and the Oflx could
be better distributed inside the cells than Oflx on the larger nanocarriers.
In contrast, the larger nanocarriers offer a higher local drug dose
and higher affinity with the target than the smaller nanocarriers.
The combination of both factors creates the optimal susceptibility
of the nanocarriers against the cells. This result suggests that a
critical size of the nanocarriers could be needed to generate optimal
potency against the bacterial cells.

For WT cells, the MICs
of Oflx attached onto the 13.0 ± 3.1
and 92.6 ± 4.4 nm NPs are 2.5 and 9.1 times lower than that of
Oflx on the smallest nanocarriers (2.4 ± 0.7 nm), respectively.
Similar to those observed in using ΔABM cells, the same amount
of Oflx is the most potent when it is delivered into the WT cells
using the largest nanocarriers (92.6 ± 4.4 nm) and vice versa,
further suggesting that densely packed Oflx on the larger nanocarriers
could offer a higher local concentration and higher binding affinity
with the target than those when they are conjugated on the smaller
NPs. The inhibitory effects of the drug nanocarriers depend on their
sizes, but they are not linearly proportional to their sizes. Interestingly,
MexAB-OprM affects the susceptibility of drug nanocarriers in a size-dependent
fashion. For example, the ratios of the MIC of WT to ΔABM cells
for free Oflx and Oflx conjugated on the 2.4 ± 0.7, 13.0 ±
3.1, and 92.6 ± 4.4 nm drug nanocarriers are 6.1, 5.3, 5.5, and
11, respectively, as shown in Figure 6 and Table 2.

Notably, for WT cells, the net gain in the amount
of accumulated
intracellular nanocarriers is determined by subtracting the amount
of nanocarriers extruded out of the cells by MexAB-OprM from the amount
of nanocarriers that entered the cells. Note that ΔABM cells
were constructed by the deletion of mexAB-oprM in
WT cells. Thus, the amount of the nanocarriers that entered the ΔABM
cells should be the same as those entered the WT cells. If the extrusion
of nanocarriers by MexAB-OprM was size-independent, then the ratio
of the MICs of WT to ΔABM cells for each sized nanocarrier should
be the same, respectively. However, they were not. The MIC of the
largest nanocarriers (92.6 ± 4.4 nm) against ΔABM is 19
times lower than that of the smallest nanocarriers (2.4 ± 0.7
nm), whereas the MIC of the largest nanocarriers (92.6 ± 4.4
nm) against WT is 9 times lower than that of the smallest nanocarrier
(2.4 ± 0.7 nm). A plausible explanation for this finding is the
size-dependent efflux function of MexAB-OprM, and MexAB-OprM could
extrude Oflx molecules on the largest nanocarriers out of the WT cells,
which could affect the MIC of the largest nanocarriers the most. For
example, when the cell extrudes a largest nanocarrier, it can reduce
the intracellular Oflx 756 times more than extrusion of a smallest
carrier. Because the inhibitory effects of the largest nanocarriers
(92.6 ± 4.4 nm) are much higher than the two other sized nanocarriers
and free Oflx, we still observed the lowest MIC of the largest nanocarriers
against the WT cells, despite its extrusion by MexAB-OprM affecting
the accumulation of intracellular Oflx the most. These interesting
findings further demonstrate that the combination of several factors
(multivalence, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics, e.g., distribution
and efflux of Oflx and Oflx nanocarriers) affects the inhibitory effects
of Oflx against the cells. This study demonstrates the possibility
of designing antibiotic nanocarriers that could potentially generate
the most potent effect against highly infectious bacterial cells,
such as P. aeruginosa.

Summary
We have synthesized and characterized three different sized antibiotic
nanocarriers (AgMUNH-Oflx NPs) by functionalizing three different
sized Ag NPs (2.4 ± 0.7, 13.0 ± 3.1, and 92.6 ± 4.4
nm) with a monolayer of AUT to prepare AgMUNH2 NPs, followed
by covalently linking them with antibiotic (Oflx) molecules. We successfully
developed a modified LB medium to culture P. aeruginosa (WT and ΔABM) that allows the nanocarriers (AgMUNH-Oflx NPs)
and AgMUNH2 NPs at the desired concentration to be stable
(non-aggregated) throughout the duration of the cell culture experiment.
We studied the dependence of the inhibitory effects of free Oflx and
Oflx covalently attached onto the surface of nanocarriers on the dose
of Oflx, the sizes of the nanocarriers, and the cellular expression
of MexAB-OprM. We found that the inhibitory effects of Oflx highly
depend on the dose of Oflx, the size of the nanocarrier, and the cellular
expression of MexAB-OprM. Interestingly, the largest nanocarriers
(92.6 ± 4.4 nm) have the lowest MICs of 0.11 ± 0.01 and
0.010 ± 0.001 μM Oflx against WT and ΔABM cells,
following by the 13.0 ± 3.1 nm nanocarriers and free Oflx, whereas
the smallest nanocarriers (2.4 ± 0.7 nm) have the highest MICs
of 1.00 ± 0.07 and 0.19 ± 0.05 μM Olfx against WT
and ΔABM cells, respectively. The results show that the largest
nanocarriers exhibit the highest bactericidal effects, whereas the
smallest nanocarriers show the lowest bactericidal effects, demonstrating
that the same amount of Oflx creates a higher bactericidal effect
when they are carried and delivered by larger NPs. These findings
suggest that the close-packed Oflx molecules on the NPs (multivalence)
could enhance their binding affinity with the target and offer a higher
payload to increase the local drug dose and potency. Notably, the
MIC of the largest nanocarriers (92.6 ± 4.4 nm) for ΔABM
is 19 times lower than that for the smallest nanocarriers (2.4 ±
0.7 nm), whereas the MIC of the largest nanocarriers (92.6 ±
4.4 nm) for WT is 9 times lower than that of the smallest nanocarriers
(2.4 ± 0.7 nm). The results suggest that MexAB-OprM can effectively
extrude such large nanocarriers out of WT cells and that the extrusion
of the larger nanocarriers can affect the inhibitory effect of Oflx
more significantly than the smaller nanocarriers due to the larger
payload of Oflx on the larger nanocarriers. In other words, MexAB-OprM
could be more efficient at protecting bacteria from larger nanocarriers
than small nanocarriers. Interestingly, although the inhibitory effects
of the drug nanocarriers depend on their sizes, they are not linearly
proportional to their sizes, which suggests that the inhibitory effects
of Oflx depend not only on multivalent local targeting effects but
also on its intracellular distribution (pharmacodynamics) and extrusion
by the transporter. Thus, an optimal size of the nanocarriers would
be needed to generate optimal inhibitory effects. These interesting
findings further demonstrate the possibility of designing antibiotic
nanocarriers that could potentially evade MDR and generate the most
potent effect against highly infectious bacterial cells, such as P. aeruginosa.

We purchased silver perchlorate
monohydrate (99%, Alfa Aesar), sodium citrate dihydrate (99%, Sigma),
sodium borohydride (98%, Sigma), hydrogen peroxide (30%, Sigma), polyvinylpyrrolidone
(PVP, Sigma), 2-mercaptoethanol (99%, Sigma), 11-amino-1-undecanethiol

(sulfo-NHS, 98.5%, Pierce), ofloxacin (≥98%, Oflx, Enzo), L-broth
(LB) powder (Sigma), and the LIVE/DEAD BacLight viability
and counting assay (Invitrogen) and used them as received. We used
nanopure deionized (DI) water (18 MΩ water, Barnstead) to prepare
commonly used standard LB medium (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract,
and 0.5% NaCl in DI water, pH = 7.2) and our modified LB medium (1%
tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, and 0.1% NaCl in DI water, pH = 7.2)

Cell Lines, Cell Culture Medium, Cell Culture, and Characterization
Three strains of Gram-negative bacterial cells (P. aeruginosa), WT (PA04290, normal expression of
MexAB-OprM), nalB-1 (overexpression mutant of MexAB-OprM), and ΔABM
(deletion of MexAB-OprM), were generously provided by Dr. Hiroshi
Yoneyama and used for this study.51,56 We first precultured
the cells in commonly used standard LB medium for 12 h. We then cultured
the cells using either standard LB medium or modified LB medium in
a shaker (MaxQ 5000, 200 rpm, 37 °C) for another 8 h. We followed
the growth of the cells in each respective medium over time and characterized
the cell growth curves by measuring the OD600 nm of the
cell suspensions in the medium every 30 min over 8 h of cell culture.
We studied the viability of the cultured cells by the end of culture
at single cell resolution using LIVE/DEAD BacLight
viability and counting assay.57 The cells
in the medium were imaged in a microchamber using dark-field optical
microscopy and epifluorescence microscopy.33,36,40,41,50 The green fluorescence cells (peak wavelength of
the fluorescence spectra of SYTO9, λmax = 520 nm)
and red fluorescence cells (peak wavelength of the fluorescence spectra
of propidium iodide, λmax = 610 nm) were used to
determine live and dead cells, respectively.57

By the end of the cell culture, we harvested the cells using
centrifugation (Beckman JA-14, 7500 rpm) and rinsed them with PBS
buffer (0.5 mM phosphate buffer, 1.5 mM NaCl, pH 7.0) three times
via centrifugation. We then suspended the cells in PBS buffer and
adjusted the cell suspension concentration to OD600 nm =
0.1.36,40,41,50,52,53 We characterized the efflux function of the MexAB-OprM membrane
transporter of live cells cultured in each medium by continuously
measuring the fluorescence intensity of the cell suspension (OD600 nm = 0.1) containing 10 μM EtBr in real time (3 s
time interval) for 2 h using a fluorescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer
LS50B) with the excitation and emission wavelengths at 465 and 600
nm, respectively.50,52,53

Synthesis and Characterization of Ag NPs
We had synthesized,
purified, and characterized three different sized Ag NPs with diameters
of 2.4 ± 0.7, 13.0 ± 3.1, and 92.6 ± 4.4 nm, as we
reported previously.32,37,38,46−48,58 Briefly, we synthesized Ag NPs with a diameter of 2.4 ± 0.7
nm by adding NaBH4 (150 μL, 100 mM) into a stirring
mixture (42.3 mL) of silver nitrate (0.11 mM), sodium citrate (1.91
mM), PVP (0.052 mM), and hydrogen peroxide (25.0 mM) that was freshly
prepared using nanopure water.38 We stirred
the solution at room temperature for another 3 h and filtered the
solution using 0.2 μm membrane filters. We prepared Ag NPs with
a diameter of 13.0 ± 3.1 nm by rapidly adding ice-cold AgClO4 (2.5 mL of 10 mM) into a stirring ice-cold mixture (247.5
mL) of sodium citrate (3 mM) and NaBH4 (10 mM).34,39 We stirred the solution at room temperature for 4 h and filtered
it using a 0.2 μm filter. We synthesized 92.6 ± 4.4 nm
Ag NPs by adding sodium citrate (10 mL, 34 mM) into a refluxing (100
°C) aqueous solution of 3.98 mM AgNO3 (500 mL).32,59 We stirred the mixture at 325 rpm for 35 min and cooled the solution
to room temperature. We then added additional 2.5 mM sodium citrate
as a stabilizer into the solution and filtered the solution using
a 0.2 μm filter.

We purified each NP solution by thoroughly
washing the NPs three times with DI water using centrifugation immediately
after the synthesis. We characterized the NP concentration, LSPR images
and spectra, and sizes of single NPs using UV–vis spectroscopy
(Hitachi U-2010), dark-field optical microscopy and spectroscopy (DFOMS),
high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) (JEOL, JEM-2100F),
and dynamic light scattering (DLS) (Nicomp 380ZLS particle sizing
system), respectively. We have fully described our DFOMS approach
in our previous studies.33,34,36−41,44,52,60,61 In this study,
the DFOMS system is equipped with a dark-field optical microscope
with a dark-field condenser (oil 1.43–1.20, Nikon) and a 100×
objective (Nikon Plan fluor 100× oil, iris, SL. N.A. 0.5–1.3,
W.D. 0.20 mm), a CCD camera (Micromax, Roper Scientific), and a multispectral
imaging system (Nuance, CRI).38,60

Synthesis and Characterization
of Drug Nanocarriers (AgMUNH-Oflx
NPs)
We added AUT (1 mL, 100 mM, in ethanol) into the freshly
prepared Ag NPs (100 mL, 50 nM, 3.3 nM, and 30 pM) of three different
sizes (2.4 ± 0.7, 13.0 ± 3.1 and 92.6 ± 4.4 nm), respectively.
We stirred the mixtures for 24 h to attach AUT onto the surface of
the NPs via the interaction of thiol groups with the NPs to prepare
functional AgMUNH2 NPs (Figure 2). We washed the AgMUNH2 NPs thoroughly
three times with nanopure water to remove excess AUT using centrifugation
(Beckman Optima L90k, 4 °C). After each washing and resuspension
step, we immediately characterized the concentrations, optical properties,
and sizes of each AgMUNH2 NP solution using UV–vis
spectroscopy, DFOMS, and DLS, respectively. Note that the AgMUNH2 NPs were suspended in DI water for storage and only suspended
in the respective buffer immediately before the experiment.

We suspended half of the purified AgMUNH2 NP solution
(50 mL) in PBS buffer (pH 7.0) immediately before control experiments.
We suspended the other half of the AgMUNH2 NP solution
(50 mL) in MES buffer (50 mM, pH 5.0) immediately before conjugating
these NPs with Oflx. We conjugated the amine groups of each size of
AgMUNH2 NPs (50 mL) with the carboxyl group of Oflx via
peptide bonds using a two-step method with EDC and sulfo-NHS as mediators
(Figure 2), as described
in the following. We first dissolved Oflx in 0.5 M HCl (1 mL) and
then diluted it using MES buffer (pH 5.0). We added EDC (100 μL,
100 mM) and sulfo-NHS (100 μL, 500 mM) into the Oflx solution
(3 mL, 50 mM) and stirred it at room temperature for 40 min to form
Oflx–sulfo-NHS esters. We added 2-mercaptoethanol to quench
the excess EDC. We added the Oflx–sulfo-NHS esters to the AgMUNH2 NPs in MES buffer (pH 5.0) and mixed the solution using a
rotary shaker at room temperature for 3 h to synthesize the AgMUNH-Oflx
NPs (nanocarriers).

We purified the drug nanocarriers (AgMUNH-Oflx
NPs) by washing
them with DI water three times and stored them at 4 °C for future
use. After each washing step, we immediately characterized the concentrations,
optical properties, and sizes of the AgMUNH2 NPs using
UV–vis spectroscopy, DFOMS, and DLS, respectively. We measured
the UV–vis absorbance spectra of various concentrations of
nanocarriers (AgMUNH-Oflx NPs) and plotted the peak absorbance of
the nanocarriers versus their concentrations to construct a calibration
curve and determine their molar absorptivity.

We measured the
UV–vis absorbance spectra of various concentrations
of Oflx alone (absence of NPs) in solution and plotted the peak absorbance
at 288 nm versus Oflx concentration to construct a calibration curve
and determine its molar absorptivity (ε288nm = 7.8
× 103 M–1 cm–1 and ε330nm = 2.4 × 103 M–1 cm–1). We subtracted the UV–vis absorption
spectrum of the AgMUNH2 NPs from that of AgMUNH-Oflx NPs
of the same size and concentration to obtain the UV–vis absorption
spectrum of Oflx conjugated with the AgMUNH2 NPs, and we
used the molar absorptivity of Oflx to determine its concentration.
We also determined the NP concentration based on the peak absorbance
of the plasmonic absorption spectra of the NPs. By dividing the concentration
of Oflx with concentration of NPs in the same AgMUNH-Oflx NP solution
using UV–vis absorption spectroscopy, we determined the conjugation
ratio of Oflx molecules to NPs for each size of drug nanocarrier.

Stability of Drug Nanocarriers (AgMUNH-Oflx NPs) in Cell Culture
Medium
We characterized the stability (non-aggregation) of
AgMUNH-Oflx NPs in the commonly used standard LB medium (1% tryptone,
0.5% yeast extract, and 0.5% NaCl in DI water, pH = 7.2) and the modified
medium (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, and 0.1% NaCl in DI water,
pH = 7.2) over 24 h using UV–vis absorption spectroscopy. We
found that the nanocarriers with Ag NP diameters of 2.4 ± 0.7,
13.0 ± 3.1, and 92.6 ± 4.4 nm at the desired concentration
(6.0 nM, 0.8 nM and 7 pM) were stable (non-aggregated) in the modified
medium over 24 h, but they are unstable (aggregated) in the standard
medium, respectively.

Inhibitory Effects of Drug Nanocarriers (AgMUNH-Oflx
NPs)
We pre-cultured the cells (WT or ΔABM) in the
standard LB
medium overnight. We then cultured the cells in the modified LB medium
(4 mL) containing a dilution series of Oflx alone, a given sized drug
nanocarrier (AgMUNH-Oflx NPs), and AgMUNH2 NPs (control
experiments) by inoculating 104 pre-cultured cells into
the medium and vigorously shaking the solution (200 rpm, 37 °C)
over 18 h.

The dilution series contains 0, 0.20, 0.40, 0.60,
0.80, 1.08, 1.62, and 2.16 μM free Oflx or Oflx conjugated with
the NPs (AgMUNH-Oflx NPs) for WT cells, which is correlated with the
concentration of the nanocarriers (NP concentration) as follows: (i)
0.23, 0.463, 0.695, 0.917, 1.25, 1.88, and 2.50 nM for the 2.4 ±
0.7 nm NPs with a conjugation ratio of 8.6 × 102 Oflx
molecules per NP; (ii) 2.12 × 10–2, 4.24 ×
10–2, 6.36 × 10–2, 8.48 ×
10–2, 0.114, 0.172, and 0.229 nM for the 13.0 ±
3.1 nm NPs with a conjugation ratio of 9.4 × 103 Oflx
molecules per NP; and (iii) 0.309, 0.618, 0.926, 1.24, 1.67, 2.50,
and 3.34 pM for the 92.6 ± 4.4 nm NPs with a conjugation ratio
of 6.5 × 105 Oflx molecules per NP, respectively.
The control experiments include the modified LB medium alone (absence
of cells) and WT cells cultured under the same conditions and at the
same time in the medium containing 2.50 nM, 0.229 nM, or 3.34 pM AgMUNH2 NPs (in the absence of Oflx) for the 2.4 ± 0.7, 13.0
± 3.1, or 92.6 ± 4.4 nm Ag NPs, respectively.

The
dilution series contains 0, 0.020, 0.040, 0.060, 0.080, 0.11,
0.14, 0.28 μM free Oflx or Oflx conjugated with the NPs (AgMUNH-Oflx
NPs) for ΔABM cells, which is correlated with the concentration
of the nanocarrier (NP concentration) as follows: (i) 2.32 ×
10–2, 4.63 × 10–2, 6.95 ×
10–2, 9.27 × 10–2, 0.127,
0.162, and 0.324 nM for the 2.4 ± 0.7 nm NPs with a conjugation
ratio of 8.6 × 102 Oflx molecules per NP; (ii) 2.12
× 10–3, 4.24 × 10–3,
6.36 × 10–3, 8.48 × 10–3, 1.48 × 10–2, and 2.97 × 10–2 nM for the 13.0 ± 3.1 nm NPs with a conjugation ratio of 9.4
× 103 Oflx molecules per NP; and (iii) 3.09 ×
10–2, 6.18 × 10–2, 9.26 ×
10–2, 0.124, 0.170, 0.216, and 0.432 pM for the
92.6 ± 4.4 nm NPs with a conjugation ratio of 6.5 × 105 Oflx molecules per NP. The control experiments included the
modified LB medium alone (absence of cells) and the ΔABM cells
cultured under the same conditions and at the same time in the medium
containing 0.324 nM, 2.97 × 10–2 nM, or 0.432
pM AgMUNH2 NPs (in the absence of Oflx) for the 2.4 ±
0.7, 13.0 ± 3.1, or 92.6 ± 4.4 nm Ag NPs, respectively.

We sampled the cell culture suspension every 6 h and quantitatively
determined the cell concentration by measuring their OD600 nm in a 96-well plate using a plate reader (BioTek Synergy HT) equipped
with an UV–vis absorption spectral detector. We plotted the
OD600 nm of the cell suspension over time to determine
the duration (17 h) that is needed for the cells to reach confluence.
We used the OD600 nm of each cell suspension at 17 h to
determine their inhibitory effects as described in the following.

We normalized the OD600 nm of each cell suspension with
the maximum OD600 nm (the cells cultured in medium alone,
blank control) among the dilution series of the cell suspensions for
each type of sample (e.g., free Oflx and each sized nanocarrier).
We then plotted the normalized OD600 nm of the cell suspension
versus the concentration of free Oflx (Oflx alone) or the concentration
of Oflx attached onto a given sized drug nanocarrier to determine
the MIC of Oflx. Each experiment was repeated three times. For each
sample, the average of three experimental measurements with a standard
deviation of the normalized OD600 nm of each cell suspension
(points in Figure 6) was fitted using the exponential decay (y = a·e–bx, inhibitory
effects upon the exponential cell growth) to determine the parameters
(a, b) of the equation with the
highest possible regression. The equation was then used to determine
the MIC (the concentration of Oflx at which the cell growth was inhibited
to half of the cell growth of the blank control experiment), as described
in the caption of Figure 6. For example, the points in Figure 6 are experimental data, and a solid line
is generated by fitting the experimental data with the equation y = a·e–bx as follows: (A): (d) y = 1.12·e–1.18x, R2 = 0.923; (e) y = 1.07·e–0.764x, R2 = 0.967; (f) y = 1.04·e–1.82x, R2 = 0.964; (g) y =
0.998·e–6.07x, R2 = 0.997. (B): (d) y = 1.12·e–8.59x, R2 = 0.892; (e) y = 0.984·e–3.58x, R2 = 0.938; (f) y = 1.13·e–11.35x, R2 = 0.920; (g) y =
0.997·e–68.82x, R2 = 0.989. Parameters “a”
and “b” in the equation for each sample
were determined based on the best fit (i.e., the highest regression
with the lowest error). Concentrations of Oflx (MIC, IC50) for free Oflx and Oflx conjugated with a given sized nanocarrier
were determined using the exponential fitting equation at half of
the maximum normalized OD600 nm for each curve. As a control
experiment, we also plotted the normalized OD600 nm of
the cell suspension at 17 h versus the concentration of AgMUNH2 NPs (absence of Oflx) that was the same as the highest concentration
of the given nanocarrier for each cell strain.

Data Analysis and Statistics
We characterized the sizes
and shapes of Ag NPs using TEM, and we acquired LSPR spectra of single
Ag NPs, AgMUNH2 NPs, and AgMUNH-Oflx NPs using DFOMS. For
each size and each type of the NP, we imaged at least 100 NPs for
each measurement, and we repeated each experiment three times. Thus,
a minimum of 300 NPs were characterized using TEM and DFOMS. All experiments,
including the study of the stability of the NPs in the medium, cell
growth curves, and MICs, were repeated three times. We used the average
of three measurements with standard deviations for each study as described
above.
