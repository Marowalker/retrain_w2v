Highly
stable gold nanoparticles immobilized on the surface of
amine-functionalized nanocomposite microspheres possessing a magnetite
(Fe3O4) nanoparticle core and a silica (SiO2) shell (Au/SiO2-shell/Fe3O4-core) were prepared. These gold nanocomposite catalysts were tested
for 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) and 2-nitroaniline (2-NA) reduction in aqueous
solution in the temperature range 293–323 K and in the presence
of aqueous NaBH4 reducing agent. The magnetically recyclable
gold catalyst showed high stability (∼3 months), efficient
recyclability (up to 10 cycles), and high activity (∼100% conversion
within 225 s, ∼700 ppm 4-NP or 2-NA). The pseudo-first-order
apparent reaction rate constants (k) of 4-NP and
2-NA reduction were 7.5 × 10–3 and 4.1 ×
10–3 s–1, respectively, and with
an apparent catalytic activity of 4.48 × 10–8 kmol/(m3 s).

1 Introduction
Removal
of organic dye pollutants such as nitro-derived aromatic
compounds from wastewater is a major challenge for chemical industries
and many localities worldwide. The United States Environmental Protection
Agency has declared 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) and 2-nitroaniline (2-NA)
as high-priority toxic pollutants because they are readily soluble in water and harmful to aquatic
life.1,2 Nitro aromatic compounds such as 4-NP and
2-NA are extensively used as chemicals for industries in everyday
life. They play a major role in the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals,
pigments, dyes, plastics, pesticides and fungicidal agents, explosives,
and industrial solvents. For example, 4-NP is one of the nitro aromatic
compounds which is an intermediate in the synthesis of paracetamol
and as raw material for fungicides.3 Similarly,
2-NA reduction also received great attention owing to its applications
in dye, rubber, and textile industries.4 2-NA is also a starting material for elastomers, aramid textile
fibers, and thermoplastics.5 However, these
notorious chemicals are highly hazardous for the environment and also
toxic toward humans, animals, and plants.6 Therefore, from both industrial and environmental points of view,
reduction of 4-NP and 2-NA is of utmost importance. For the transformation
of such harmful chemicals, a significant amount of research has been
done so far, with most of the established methods being based on wet
air oxidation,7 electrochemical reduction,8,9 biodegradation method,10,11 and catalytic reduction.6,12−15 Among the various existing investigations, catalytic reduction methods
were found to be the most promising ones16,17 as the use of a catalyst enhanced the electron transfer between
the reductant and the acceptor nitro aromatic compound. Over the past
decades, metal nanoparticles (NPs) have been used extensively as catalysts
for several reactions and received much attention due to their high
catalytic activity. The high surface area-to-volume ratio, high surface
energy, and Fermi potential of metal nanoparticles make them suitable
for use in catalysis.6,18−20 It is well
established that at the nanoscale size noble metals are particularly
effective for catalytic conversion.21 A
prototypical example is that of gold, which is inactive when present
in bulk but becomes active in the form of nanoparticles (NPs), as
demonstrated for a number of gold NP-catalyzed reactions including CO oxidation,21 propylene epoxidation,22,23 acetylene hydrochlorination,24 glycerol
oxidation,25 and alcohol oxidation.26 Although it has been reported that metal nanoparticles
in homogeneous reaction media show higher catalytic activities than
those of their corresponding heterogeneous supported counterparts,27 their separation from the reaction medium and
the possibility of product contamination are major challenges. For
heterogeneous systems, gold nanoparticles have been usually dispersed
on supports such as carbon,28 metal oxides,29 and zeolites.30 Metal
oxide-supported gold nanoparticles, for example, have been widely
used for CO oxidation (even at subambient temperatures) as well as
for propylene epoxidation using hydrogen and oxygen mixtures.23 For these reactions, the catalytic activity
has been shown to be highly dependent on gold particle size, with
smaller nanoparticles commonly being more active. Another major challenge
with supported catalysts possessing small particle sizes and in liquid
phase reactions is that metal NPs tend to sinter and leach if metal
and support interactions are weak. Therefore, methodologies for immobilization
of metal nanoparticles on solid supports to minimize this complication
have been usually explored.31

The
additional presence of Fe nanoparticles in novel metal-supported
catalytic systems has also been found to be advantageous as it provides
magnetic separability from the reaction medium.32,33 However, as-synthesized Fe3O4 metal NPs are
not stable due to their high surface energy, which strongly favors
their aggregation, decomposition, and oxidation.32 One approach to avoid these issues is to protect Fe3O4 NPs with a shell of tunable thickness of a different
material. Such an approach has been explored by Duan et al.34 who synthesized Fe-glycerate hollow nanospheres,
followed by a coating of polydopamine (Fe@PDA) and immobilization
of novel metal Pd over the double-shell hollow nanospheres. Chang
et al.1 also fabricated Au nanoparticles
over chitosan-coated Fe3O4 nanocarriers, whereas
Mohammadi et al.35 decorated Ag NPs over
silica-coated iron oxide using safflower extract for nitrophenol reduction.
In another approach, Zheng et al.36 immobilized
AuNPs on synthesized Fe3O4@SiO2 (SiO2-shell/Fe3O4-core) via added surface Sn2+ linking followed by reduction. Metal NPs supported on Fe3O4 and Fe3O4@SiO2 materials
have also been prepared via support functionalization by −NH2 groups and applied toward 4-NP reduction23,37−39 along with 2-NA reduction.40,41 Deposition of metal NPs has also been explored on SiO2 surfaces as reduction catalysts.42,43 Therefore,
SiO2-shell/Fe3O4-core materials are
expected to be excellent supports for stabilization of metal NPs.35 However, in most of the cases, catalyst performance
was incomplete as a comparison was based on the reaction completion
time rather than on more rigorous normalized reaction rates (e.g.,
per unit surface area of the catalyst) or reaction rate constants.

Although 4-NP reduction has been widely studied, its counterpart,
2-NA, reduction has not received as much attention despite its environmental
and industrial relevance. Herein, we introduce a system composed of
Au nanoparticles supported on amino-functionalized SiO2-shell/Fe3O4-core microspheres (Au/(NH2)SiO2-shell/Fe3O4-core) with
catalytic properties for the reduction of nitro aromatic compounds,
which can be magnetically recoverable from the reaction medium. The
Au/(NH2)SiO2-shell/Fe3O4-core materials were characterized by nitrogen physisorption (i.e.,
for surface area and porosity), X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), and Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy (FTIR) techniques, and their catalytic activity was evaluated
for the reduction of 4-NP and 2-NA in the aqueous phase at near-ambient
conditions. The obtained results show the role of gold nanoparticles
in the catalytic reduction and support surface functionalization as a viable strategy for nanoparticle
deposition and the use of SiO2-shell/Fe3O4-core materials as adequate materials for catalyst recovery
during the conversion of nitro-derived compounds present in aqueous
solutions.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Catalyst
Characterization
From Figure 1, the XRD patterns
of Fe3O4, SiO2-shell/Fe3O4-core (Fe3O4@SiO2),
(NH2)SiO2-shell/Fe3O4-core
(Fe3O4@SiO2-NH2), and
Au/(NH2)SiO2-shell/Fe3O4-core (Fe3O4@SiO2-NH2–Au) materials can be seen. The XRD patterns of Fe3O4 nanoparticles display intense 2θ peaks at about
30.1, 35.4, and 43.1°, which are assigned to the (220), (311),
and (400) planes, respectively. These peaks indicate that Fe3O4 nanoparticles present a crystalline cubic spinel structure
of magnetite (JCPDS no. 00-019-0629). The XRD pattern of the SiO2-shell/Fe3O4-core sample shows a broad
diffraction peak at 2θ = 20–30° due to the existence
of amorphous silica.44 In this sample,
the peak intensities corresponding to the (220), (311), and (400)
planes of cubic Fe3O4 are almost indistinguishable
after silica coating as a result of dilution and reduced X-rays interaction
with Fe3O4. Furthermore, the XRD patterns of
Au/(NH2)SiO2-shell/Fe3O4-core are indexed by weak peaks due to cubic Fe3O4 and gold cubic phase (two peaks at 2θ values of 38.2
and 44.4° due to the (111) and (200) planes, JCPDS card no. 00-004-0784).

The N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms of Fe3O4@SiO2-NH2–Au and
the corresponding support materials are shown in Figure 2, whereas their surface areas
and average pore diameters are summarized in Table 1. The Fe3O4 isotherm
can be classified as a type IV with an H2 hysteresis loop in the relative
pressure range of 0.1–0.5, which indicates the presence of
mesopores formed during the agglomeration of Fe3O4 NPs. Such agglomeration is also reflected in the small observed
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area of
24 m2/g and an average pore size of 3.0 nm. As expected,
the SiO2-shell/Fe3O4-core magnetic
microspheres (Fe3O4@SiO2) also possess
similar textural properties (type-IV isotherm, H2 hysteresis) characteristic
of mesoporous materials.45 The higher surface
area (53 m2/g) of the Fe3O4@SiO2 sample with respect to that of Fe3O4 is the result of the presence of SiO2 whose specific
surface area and pore size should be larger than those of Fe3O4. Also, the SiO2 shell should help reduce
the agglomeration of Fe3O4, freeing void space
among particles. After the −NH2 functionalization,
the surface area increased to 111 m2/g. It is not clear
at present why there is a significant increase in surface area with
respect to that of the parent Fe3O4@SiO2, but we speculate that the high-temperature hydrothermal
treatment may have opened additional pores in the SiO2 shell,
making them available for N2 adsorption, as suggested by
the larger observed average pore size (3.4 nm). Such pores, however,
are blocked upon significant Au deposition on the SiO2 surface,
thus reducing the surface area from 111 to 62 m2/g in the
final Au/(NH2)SiO2-shell/Fe3O4-core catalyst. The Au loading on the Au/(NH2)SiO2-shell/Fe3O4-core catalyst obtained
from energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) measurements was 3.4
wt %, confirming that gold was incorporated in the Fe3O4@SiO2-NH2–Au catalyst.

Figures 3 and 4 display the HR-TEM images
of SiO2-shell/Fe3O4-core and Au/(NH2)/SiO2-shell/Fe3O4-core catalyst
NPs with a mean
diameter of 440 ± 40 nm. It has been reported that the shape
and size of Fe3O4 NPs are difficult to control
during synthesis.46Figure 3a shows an example of the multiagglomerates
of SiO2-shell/Fe3O4-core that can
still form. This is an inherent challenge for the synthesis of magnetic
core–shell nanocomposites of uniform size distribution; nevertheless,
the ultimate goal of preparing SiO2-shell/Fe3O4-core nanocomposites that are easily recoverable is
shown to be feasible (Figure 3) and is demonstrated in Figure 3d, which shows the presence of both Si and
Fe on the SiO2/Fe3O4 support.

microspheres. The inset in (d) shows the Au particle size distribution.

It has been revealed that the
obtained Fe3O4–SiO2-NH2–Au catalyst has an
average AuNP diameter of 6.7 ± 1.6 nm, which is distributed homogeneously
over the support surface. The existence of Fe, Si, and Au is also
demonstrated in the EDS spectra of the support and catalyst NPs in Figures 3d and 4f. These results indicate a strong interaction of the gold
NPs with the NH2-SiO2-shell/Fe3O4-core support enabled by the amine surface modification. The
surface of the functionalized SiO2 coating in the core–shell
Fe3O4@SiO2 microspheres consists
mainly of NH3+ and unmodified Si–OH groups. Upon
gold deposition on the SiO2 surface, the negatively charged
AuCl4– gold precursor interacts preferentially with
the −NH3+ groups through electrostatic
attraction and thus resulting in an almost quantitative deposition
of gold over the whole silica surface, which is highly crystalline
in nature (Figure 4c).40

The transmission FTIR spectra
of Fe3O4, Fe3O4@SiO2, Fe3O4@SiO2-NH2, and Fe3O4@SiO2-NH2–Au
in the 4000–400 cm–1 range are shown in Figure 5. The band in the
region of 585 cm–1 is
assigned to the stretching vibration of Fe–O bonds.47 The bands in the regions of 3400 and 1632 cm–1 indicate O–H and H–O–H bond
vibrations of surface-adsorbed water molecules. In the case of Fe3O4@SiO2, Fe3O4@SiO2-NH2, and gold-deposited Fe3O4@SiO2-NH2 materials, the peak
intensity in the hydroxyl region (3400–3600 cm–1) increased sharply as a result of a combination of the stretching
vibration of silanol groups or hydrogen bonding as well as the axial
deformation of Si–OH groups present on the SiO2 surface.48 The band at 1107 cm–1 is attributed
to the asymmetric stretching vibration of framework Si–O–Si
bridges, whereas the peak at 950 cm–1 has been assigned
to the stretching vibration of Si–OH and Si–Oδ− groups. The peak at 803 cm–1 can be ascribed to
the Si–O–Si symmetric stretching and successive formation
of the Si–O–Fe moiety.44 The
slight decrease of peak intensity at 803 cm–1 with
gold loading suggests a strong interaction of AuNPs with silica. Additionally,
a new band at 2930 cm–1 in the Fe3O4@SiO2-NH2 and Fe3O4@SiO2-NH2–Au samples indicates the presence
of −NH2 vibration.49 Therefore,
these results overall indicate that 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES),
which is a SiO2 surface modifier, was successfully attached
to the Fe3O4@SiO2 surface and remained
after Au deposition.

2.2 Catalytic
Activity and Stability
To check the catalyst activity performance,
the reduction reactions
of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) and 2-nitroaniline (2-NA) in the presence
of NaBH4 were chosen as test reactions. Table 2 summarizes the 4-NP and 2-NA
complete conversion results for the Au/NH2-SiO2-shell/Fe3O4-core catalyst. It can be seen
that all gold catalysts are active for the reduction of nitro aromatic
compounds, with the SiO2 support performing slightly better
than Fe3O4. The tendency of Fe3O4 to agglomerate and the slightly higher activity of SiO2-supported gold NPs, therefore, justify the use of a magnetically
recoverable catalyst based on a SiO2-shell/Fe3O4-core composite. The corresponding Au/SiO2-shell/Fe3O4-core catalyst, as expected, resulted
in a catalyst more active than Au/Fe3O4.

0.1 cm3 of aqueous 4-NP or 2-NA solution (5 × 10–3 M, 696 ppm), 1.0 cm3 of freshly prepared
NaBH4 (0.2 M) solution, 2 cm3 ultrapure water,
3 mg of catalyst,
303 K reaction temperature.

The catalytic activity of Au/NH2-SiO2-shell/Fe3O4-core was further investigated in the reduction
of 4-NP and 2-NA as a function of residence time as monitored by UV–vis
spectroscopy (Figure 6). UV–vis spectroscopy was used because of its convenience,
as bands for reactant and products can be easily discerned in the
spectra. In the case of 4-NP reduction (Figure 6a), two absorption bands are observed, one
at 398 nm and another at 298 nm, which are assigned to 4-NP and 4-aminophenol
(4-AP reduction product), respectively. At the studied reaction conditions,
it can be seen that after the addition of catalyst (∼3 mg of
Au/NH2-SiO2-shell/Fe3O4-core, t > 0), the band due to 4-NP (398 nm)
progressively
disappeared, whereas the band due to 4-AP (298 nm) gradually evolved
until reaching a maximum after around 3.75 min, indicating near-complete
reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP. In the reduction of 2-NA, two bands at
411 and 282 nm corresponded to 2-NA, whereas a band at 290 nm was
due to o-phenylenediamine (o-PA)
(Figure 6b). Similar
to 4-NP reduction, 2-NA was reduced as indicated by a decrease in
the main 411 nm band, which extinguished after around 4.20 min, indicating
full conversion into o-PA, as shown by the remaining
large band at 290 nm. It is worth noticing that these reactions did
not proceed in the presence of the bare supports SiO2-shell,
Fe3O4-core, or SiO2-shell/Fe3O4-core, indicating that gold NPs are essential
for the reduction of nitro aromatic compounds. The apparent conversion
rates at 4-NP and 2-NA complete reduction were calculated to be (∼1.1–1.2)
× 10–2 (mol substrate/mol surface Au/s).

4-NP and (b) 2-NA. Reaction conditions: 0.1 cm3 of aqueous
4-NP or 2-NA solution (5 × 10–3 M, 696 ppm),
1.0 cm3 of freshly prepared NaBH4 (0.2 M) solution,
2 cm3 ultrapure water, 3 mg of catalyst weight, 303 K reaction
temperature.

Additional 4-NP and 2-NA
reduction tests with the Au/NH2-SiO2-shell/Fe3O4-core catalyst
were performed at several near-ambient temperatures as shown in Figure 7. For comparison
purposes, temporal reactivity tests, such as those shown in Figure 7, were analyzed assuming
a pseudo-first-order kinetics via ln(Ct/Co) vs residence time plots to evaluate
the apparent reaction rates. The pseudo first order fitted reasonably
well to nearly 99% of the conversion of the reactions. The corresponding
apparent reaction rate constants, denoted here kapp, as a function of temperature are shown in Figure 7b,d. A linear relationship
was found between ln(kapp) and 1/T. The apparent rate constant (kapp) values obtained under the same reaction conditions at 293, 303,
313, and 323 K were 4.3 × 10–3, 7.4 ×
10–3, 9.0 × 10–3, and 11.0
× 10–3 s–1, respectively,
for 4-NP reduction and 3.2 × 10–3, 4.1 ×
10–3, 5.2 × 10–3, and 6.5
× 10–3 s–1, respectively,
for 2-NA reduction. The obtained apparent activation energies were
24.6 and 18.4 kJ/mol for 4-NP and 2-NA reduction, respectively.

and 2-NA, respectively; (b, d) plots of ln kapp versus 1/T for 4-NP and 2-NA, respectively.
The black lines correspond to the best straight line fit.

To further evaluate the stability and recyclability
of the catalyst
for 4-NP and 2-NA reduction, continuous runs were carried out after
(magnetically) recovering the Au/NH2-SiO2-shell/Fe3O4-core catalyst (by simply placing a magnet to
the side of the reaction container while the reacted solution was
taken off), followed by washing with water, which was reused in the
next cycle. The experimental results for 10 successive recycling reactions,
as shown in Figure 8, demonstrated that the catalyst did not undergo any appreciable
change in its activity and only a small drop in reaction time for
complete conversion was noticed during the 10 cycles (4.0–5.7
min for 4-NP and 4.3–6.2 min for 2-NA). More remarkably, even
after 90 days of storage, the catalyst efficiently carried out 100%
conversion of 4-NP and 2-NA within 6.8 and 7.5 min, respectively.

tests of the Fe3O4@SiO2-NH2–Au catalyst for 10 successive runs and a fresh
run after a long storage time (around 90 days after the catalyst synthesis)
for (a) 4-NP and (b) 2-NA. Reaction conditions: 0.1 cm3 of aqueous 4-NP or 2-NA solution (5 × 10–3 M, 696 ppm), 1.0 cm3 of freshly prepared NaBH4 (0.2 M) solution, 2 cm3 of ultrapure water, 3 mg of catalyst,
303 K reaction temperature.

The catalytic performance of the Au/NH2-SiO2-shell/Fe3O4-core catalyst was compared
to
that of previously reported catalysts for the same reaction, as shown
in Tables 3 and 4, respectively. The results in these tables indicate
that the synthesized Au/NH2-SiO2-shell/Fe3O4-core catalyst exhibited comparable or better
catalytic activity (and time for 100% reaction completion) for 4-NP
and 2-NA reduction than that of other reported catalysts. However,
it is generally accepted that catalytic performance depends on metal
NP size, active site density, stability, and metal–support
interaction.50−55 The data presented in Tables 3 and 4 suggest that the reduction of
nitro aromatic compounds in the aqueous phase by gold-based catalysts
appears to be dominated by the size of gold NPs and nature of the
gold–support interface.

In gold catalysis, the effect
that particle size has on catalytic
activity is well known; however, the reasons for this are still a
matter of debate. Many different hypotheses have been put forward
including electronic exposure
of gold sites of given coordination, etc., which appear to be dependent
on the reaction under study.56 For example,
in gas phase reactions with supported gold catalysts, it appears that
there is a gold nanoparticle size (and not necessarily the same) at
which an optimum number of active sites exist at the support–metal
particle interface that effectively catalyze several reactions such
as the water–gas shift and CO oxidation reaction.56,57 In liquid phase reactions, the situation is more complex as solvent
molecules can solvate around gold nanoparticles to different extents
and block or facilitate access to gold active sites. This effect is
evident, for example, in prior reports for reduction of 4-NP by AuNPs
(5, 9, 11, and 19 nm) supported by polyphenol grafting on collagen
fibers.58 Although all catalysts exhibited
catalytic activity for 4-NP reduction even with particles as large
as 19 nm, an optimum activity was found with the 11 nm AuNP catalyst.
This high value of activity was hypothesized to be due to optimum
access to gold active sites because of lower steric hindrance of the
polyphenol grafting agent that remained on the catalyst surface.58 Similar particle size effects were also observed
for 4-NP reduction with colloidal AuNPs and Al2O3 supported Au (2.0, 3.4, 5.7, and 8.2 nm) catalysts, which resulted
in optimum particle sizes of 3.4 nm for the former and between 3.4
and 5.7 nm for the latter.59 The average
gold particle size in the Fe3O4@SiO2-NH2–Au catalyst is relatively large (6.7 nm) with
respect to that in some colloidal AuNPs in Table 3 (e.g., nos. 4 and 6) but within the previously
reported optimum Au range for Au/Al2O3.59 This apparent discrepancy of higher activity in the Fe3O4@SiO2-NH2–Au catalyst with
respect to that in the colloidal AuNPs could also be explained by
steric hindrance because of the presence of larger organic ligands
that impede diffusion of reactants to the Au surface, something that
is not present in the Fe3O4@SiO2-NH2–Au catalyst prepared in this work.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, we demonstrated the successful
preparation of multifunctional
magnetic Au/NH2-SiO2-shell/Fe3O4-core nanocomposite microspheres of a magnetite particle (Fe3O4) core with a well-defined silica-protected shell
and the deposition of active AuNPs of approximately 6.7 ± 1.6
nm on the outer shell of −NH2-functionalized SiO2-shell/Fe3O4-core. The synthetic procedure
for the functionalization of the nanocomposite catalyst was relatively
simple, allowing it to also be easily separable by an external magnet
from the reaction environment. The experimental reaction rates, apparent
reaction rate constants, and activation energies showed that the catalytic
reduction of 4-nitrophenol and 2-nitroaniline at the studied conditions
was complete within several minutes with similar or better performance
than that of state-of-the-art catalysts. Recyclability and stability
studies confirmed that the catalyst was not only easily recoverable
from the reaction environment but also possessed high stability and
good reusability after a long period of time. The results of this
study showed that the family of Au/NH2-SiO2-shell/Fe3O4-core catalysts is promising toward the heterogenization
of Au, easily recoverability of catalysts, and conversion of nitro
aromatic compounds in aqueous phase either from an environmental or
industrial point of view.

4 Experimental Details
4.1 Materials
Iron(III) chloride anhydrous
(98%), toluene (99.5%), and ethanol (99.9%) were purchased from Merck
(India). Chloroauric acid (99%) was obtained from Loba Chemie (India).
Ammonia solution (30% NH3 in water) was purchased from
Qualigen Fine Chemicals (India). 3-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES,
99%) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Germany). Tetraethyl orthosilicate
(TEOS) was procured (98%) from Acros. All chemicals were used as received
without any further purification.

4.2 Catalyst
Synthesis
4.2.1 Synthesis of Fe3O4 Nanoparticles
FeCl3 (3.25 g), 1.3 g of trisodium
citrate, and 6 g of sodium acetate were added to 50 cm3 of ethylene glycol solution, which results in the formation of a yellow solution, followed by stirring
for 1 h. Then, the whole solution was subjected to hydrothermal treatment
at 473 K for 10 h in a Teflon-lined autoclave. After that, the resultant
solids were separated and washed three times with an ethanol–water
mixture. Then, the solids were dried under vacuum at 333 K for 12
h.64

4.2.2 Preparation
of Fe3O4@SiO2 Microspheres
Synthesized Fe3O4 (20 mg) was added to a sealed
round-bottom flask containing
120 cm3 of ethanol and 18 cm3 of deionized water
and sonicated for 15 min in an Ar atmosphere. Then, 7.5 cm3 of 28% aqueous solution of NH3 was added to it, followed
by the slow addition of 3.8 cm3 of TEOS for 10 min. This
mixture was subjected to mechanical stirring for 10 h, after which
the resultant precipitate was separated and washed three times with
an ethanol and water mixture. Finally, the resulting solids were dried
under vacuum at 333 K for 12 h.65

4.2.3 Amine Modification
The dry support
material (0.5 g) was added to a sealed round-bottom flask containing
50 cm3 of toluene and sonicated (ultrasonic bath, Fischer
Scientific) under an Ar atmosphere. Then, 0.7 cm3 of APTES
was added under a slow stirring condition and refluxed at 393 K for
12 h. After this step, the resultant solids were separated and washed
three times with an ethanol–water mixture. Finally, the solid
was dried in a vacuum oven (LabTech) at 318 K for 12 h.66

4.2.4 Gold Deposition
The support material
(0.5 g) was added to a solution containing 150 cm3 of H2O and 0.035 g of chloroauric acid under stirring. Then, 5
cm3 of a freshly prepared 0.1 M NaBH4 solution
was added to the previous solution, which resulted in a rapid color
change from buff to wine red. After this step, the resultant solid
was separated and washed three times with an ethanol–water
mixture. The resulting solid was then dried under vacuum at 323 K
for 12 h.67 The comprehensive synthesis
process of the as-prepared Au/NH2-SiO2-shell/Fe3O4-core is depicted in Figure S1.

4.3 Characterization
Nitrogen adsorption–desorption
isotherms were measured at liquid nitrogen temperature (∼77
K) with a Quantachrome Nova-3200e instrument. Samples were pretreated
at 573 K for 6 h under high vacuum. The surface area was determined
by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. The pore
size distributions were calculated from the isotherm desorption branch
using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda model. XRD patterns
and catalyst crystalline phases were recorded and identified at ambient
temperature on an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker AXS D-8, Advanced SWAX)
using Cu Kα radiation (0.15406 nm) as the X-ray source. Peaks
were identified by a search-match technique using X’Pert HighScore
Plus software with reference to the JCPDS database. The HR-TEM investigation
was done by a JEOL JEM 2100 microscope operated at 200 kV acceleration
voltage using a lacey carbon-coated Cu grid of 300 mesh size. UV–vis
spectroscopic measurements were carried out with a UV-2450 spectrometer
(Shimadzu). The FTIR spectra were recorded with a PerkinElmer GX spectrometer.
The spectra were recorded in the range of 400–4000 cm–1 using the KBr pellet technique.
