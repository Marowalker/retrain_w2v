Encapsulation
of nucleic acids is an important technology in gene
delivery, construction of “artificial cells”, genome
protection, and other fields. However, although there have been a
number of protocols reported for encapsulation of short or oligomeric
DNAs, encapsulation of genome-sized DNA containing hundreds of kilobase
pairs is challenging because the length of such DNA is much longer
compared to the size of a typical microcapsule. Here, we report a
protocol for encapsulation of a ca. 60 μm contour length DNA
into several micrometer-sized polyelectrolyte capsules. The encapsulation
was carried out by (1) compaction of T4 DNA with multivalent cations,
(2) entrapment of DNA condensates into micrometer-sized CaCO3 beads, (3) assembly of polyelectrolyte multilayers on a bead surface,
and (4) dissolution of beads resulting in DNA unfolding and release.
Fluorescence microscopy was used to monitor the process of long DNA
encapsulation at the level of single-DNA molecules. The differences
between long and short DNA encapsulation processes and morphologies
of products are discussed.

Introduction
Encapsulation of nucleic
acids is an important research area from
both fundamental and applied points of view. DNA encapsulation is
an attractive tool for genetic information storage,1,2 DNA
protection,3,4 and transport.5 Being coupled with a suitable nucleic acid cargo release approach,
DNA encapsulation represents an attractive strategy for gene delivery.6−8 During the past decade, several research groups successfully elaborated
protocols for encapsulation of DNA macromolecules9−11 and DNA oligomers12 into polyelectrolyte capsules and studied their
properties inside microconfinement. Release of encapsulated DNA cargo
was achieved in a controlled way by suitable design of a capsule wall.9,12−14 Notably, most of these studies utilized relatively
short DNA macromolecules at high concentrations that were, in most
of cases, homogeneously distributed in the interior of polyelectrolyte
capsules. Therefore, the features related to spatial localization
of individual DNA chains could not be revealed. Encapsulation of substantially
longer DNA molecules is a more challenging task due to issues related
to DNA damage, adhesion to the interface of a confinement, etc. and
to the best of our knowledge, has never been demonstrated so far.

On the other hand, in vitro systems containing sub-megabase-sized
DNA macromolecules inside a micrometer-sized confinement are highly
relevant to the state of DNA in living cells, in which several meters
long DNA is confined inside a tiny nucleus of several micrometers
size. Such systems can be utilized for a better understanding of DNA
structure and behavior in vivo.15 A number
of “artificial cell” models containing DNA in a microconfinement
were elaborated on the basis of water-in-oil16−18 or water-in-water
microdroplets,19 liposomes,20 and giant vesicles21−24 (Figure 1) to compare DNA conformational behavior
in a bulk solution and inside the microconfinement. These studies
found a strong effect of the confinement on the DNA higher-order structure
and its biological activity.25 However,
due to the nonpermeable nature of the interface between a confinement
and external solution, the composition of a fluid inside such containers
cannot be changed after DNA encapsulation and the analysis of dynamic
changes in DNA higher-order structure is not generally possible.

“artificial cell” models. (A) DNA confined
in water-in-oil droplet. (B) DNA confined in a giant vesicle. (C)
DNA confined in a semipermeable polyelectrolyte capsule (this study).

Here, we propose an alternative
model of “artificial cell”
with a semipermeable boundary (Figure 1) that may allow a direct observation of long DNA behavior
inside the microconfinement. We report an encapsulation protocol for
a long DNA (ca. 166 kbp, ca. 60 μm contour length) into a polyelectrolyte
capsule of ca. 5 μm diameter by introducing a crucial DNA compaction
step and discuss DNA conformational changes during construction of
such systems. By comparing encapsulation of long bacteriophage DNA
and short salmon sperm DNA (ca. 300 bp), we also make clear a difference
in the partitioning of long and short DNAs inside polyelectrolyte
microcapsules.

Results and Discussion
Figure 2 illustrates
the procedure used for long DNA molecule encapsulation into a microcapsule
of several micrometers diameter. This protocol is based on co-precipitation
strategy used for short DNA and proteins but contains an important
DNA compaction step (Figure 2A). Similar to a living cell, which stores DNA having length
several orders of magnitude larger than the size of cell, the contour
length of T4 DNA (ca. 60 μm) is much larger than the diameter
of a typical polyelectrolyte capsule (ca. 10 μm). Previous
protocols used for short DNA encapsulation, such as adsorption of
DNA on the surface of a solid sacrificial template9,12 or
diffusion-adsorption of DNA in the interior of nanoporous beads,10 cannot be used because neither can long DNA
diffuse into capsules’ interiors nor can it adsorb in a regular
and reproducible way on the surface of a microtemplate. Therefore,
long DNA was first compacted into globular condensates using a cationic
binder (Figure 2A)
and transferred into the reaction mixture of CaCl2 and
Na2CO3. Reaction of CaCl2 and Na2CO3 yields CaCO3 nanoparticles assembling
into metastable, several micrometer-sized nanoporous CaCO3 beads entrapping compact DNA particles from solution (Figure 2B). Layer-by-layer deposition
method is then used to construct a multilayered film from cationic
and anionic polyelectrolytes on the surface of the beads (Figure 2C). Finally, CaCO3 beads are dissolved by EDTA to release the DNA into the interior
of a capsule (Figure 2D).

Compaction and Entrapment of Long-Chain DNA Molecules into CaCO3 Microbeads
Conformational behavior of single-sub-megabase
long DNA molecules can be easily monitored by fluorescence microscopy
(FM). T4 DNA is a giant nucleic acid of ca. 60 μm contour length
that, in aqueous solutions of 0.01–0.1 M ionic strength, adopts
a random coil conformation of ca. 5 μm long-axis length and
exhibits a free Brownian motion (Figure 3A,B). The dimension of DNA coil is comparable
with diameter of typical CaCO3 beads (5–10 μm)
that are used for DNA encapsulation; therefore, to avoid DNA damage,
compaction of DNA is necessary to drastically decrease DNA molecules’
dimension. Due to its long length, giant T4 DNA molecule is fragile
and easily suffers damage under hydrodynamic stress,26 irradiation,27 etc.; thus, compaction
of DNA plays an important role in protecting DNA during entrapment
into CaCO3 beads.

(A, B) and in TE buffer solution containing 5 mM spermine (C, D).
Snapshot series (B, D) show single-molecule motion T4 DNA in coil
(B) and in globule (D) conformations observed in corresponding samples.
The time interval between snapshots is 2–3 ms. Insets are DNA
long-axis length distributions of unfolded and compact DNA molecules
built by measurement of at least 100 individual DNA molecules.

Negatively charged DNA molecules
undergo compaction into high-density
condensates upon addition of various multivalent cations that cause
DNA charge neutralization.28 Among DNA
condensing agents, spermine, a naturally occurring tetraamine, was
routinely utilized for DNA compaction.29Figure 3C,D shows
FM images of compacted T4 DNA molecules after addition of spermine
(5 mM) and snapshots of the Brownian motion of DNA globule. Comparison
of DNA long-axis length distributions in Figure 3A,C shows that addition of spermine causes
a drastic decrease of DNA molecular volume, which is on the order
of 104–105 times.30 The actual size of compact DNA condensates is approximately
100 nm,31 i.e., significantly smaller than
the typical diameter of CaCO3 beads; therefore, the precompacted
DNA can be accurately entrapped into a sacrificial template.

Mixing of CaCl2 and Na2CO3 solutions
of submolar concentrations under vigorous stirring yields nanoparticles
assembling into spherical vaterite (CaCO3) microbeads of
several micrometers diameter. Addition of compact DNA globules into
this solution should result in entrapment of DNA globules into growing
CaCO3 beads. However, the presence of high concentrations
of divalent Ca2+ cations in the reaction mixture may lead
to the unfolding of compact DNA globules due to competition of di-
and tetravalent cations for DNA binding32 whereas vigorous stirring may also cause severe mechanical damage
of unfolded long DNA molecules by sheared flow.33 To avoid T4 DNA decompaction and damage, DNA globules compacted
by spermine were introduced to a solution of growing CaCO3 beads 10–15 s after CaCl2 and Na2CO3 solutions mixing and further growth of CaCO3 was
conducted without stirring. To gain insight into the difference between
short and long DNA molecule encapsulation, we also performed encapsulation
of short double-stranded DNA from salmon sperm (ca. 300 bp) under
the same conditions. In contrast to predominately monomolecular compaction
of long DNA molecules, compaction of short DNA by spermine results
in random multimolecular condensation and gradual time-dependent growing
of such DNA condensates (Supporting Information, Figure S1).

CaCO3 beads containing long and
short DNAs were visualized
by bright-field and fluorescence microscopies (Figure 4A,B). In both cases, beads of ca. 10 μm
size and spherical morphology were formed and contained nucleic acid
cargo successfully loaded into beads. The partitioning of DNA in beads
was strongly affected by DNA length. Spermine-pretreated T4 DNA in
beads was mostly observed as compact globules of ca. 0.7–1.0
μm size (Figure 4A). The number of DNA globules per bead varied in a range between
0 and ca. 5 globules. A rough estimation of an average number of T4
DNA molecules per CaCO3 bead based on 10 μm diameter
and 1.6 g/cm3 density34 gives
ca. 8 globules pear bead. The estimated value is somewhat higher than
that found experimentally that can be caused by T4 DNA multimolecular
condensation or aggregation during compaction with spermine. T4 DNA
globules were preferentially positioned closer to the outer interface
of beads (Figure 4C),
which might be due to that fact that T4 DNA globules were added to
a solution of growing beads after the core part had been formed. A
very different state and distribution of entrapped DNA inside beads
was observed for short DNA molecules (Figure 4B). DNA was found in the form of aggregates
of different sizes and morphologies appearing at different densities.
This highly inhomogeneous DNA partitioning is due to the formation
and coexistence of DNA condensates of different sizes during compaction
with spermine (Supporting Information, Figure S1).

(A) and salmon sperm DNA (B) labeled with YOYO fluorescent dye and
entrapped into CaCO3 beads. The images of beads dispersed
in Milli-Q water were recorded as superpositions of bright-field images
and fluorescence images acquired through a blue excitation filter
B-2A (Nikon) with longpass emission. Quasi-3D profiles of light and
fluorescent intensities of representative beads are given for beads
marked with an asterisk (*). Diameter distributions of beads were
obtained by measuring 100 beads. (C) Preferential position of compacted
T4 DNA globule entrapped into CaCO3 beads shown as a histogram
of DNA globule relative position between the center of a bead (position
0.0) and an edge (position +1.0).

The entrapment efficiency of long and short DNAs into CaCO3 beads was quantified by fluorescence spectroscopy measurements
of a DNA-bound fluorescent dye YOYO in solutions before and after
DNA entrapment. Fluorescence spectra on Figure 5 show that the intensity of YOYO fluorescence
in solution decreased drastically after DNA entrapment into beads
and separation, indicating that the entrapment of both T4 DNA and
salmon sperm DNA was almost quantitative.

and spermine (300 μM) before and after co-precipitation with
CaCO3 beads. (A) and (B) show spectral changes for salmon
sperm DNA and T4 DNA, respectively.

Construction of Capsule Walls by LbL Deposition of Polyelectrolytes
In the next step, the (PSS/PAH)2/PSS polyelectrolyte
multilayers were assembled on a surface of beads loaded with DNA.
The composition of the multilayer was chosen to get higher polyanion
contents to gain an overall negative change and provide efficient
repulsion between the encapsulated DNA and capsule wall in the target
capsule. Cationic PAH was covalently labeled with Texas Red fluorescent
dye added to the original PAH solution at 0.1% molar ratio to visualize
the multilayer during microscopic observations.

Figure 6A shows fluorescence images
of beads containing T4 DNA (green fluorescence) coated with five layers
of polyelectrolytes (red fluorescence). Deposition of multilayer did
not affect T4 DNA conformational state in beads: T4 DNA globules were
observed inside coated beads similar to the beads without polyelectrolyte
multilayers, indicating that no DNA conformational changes happened
during multilayer deposition. It should be mentioned that the size
of pores in CaCO3 beads (20–60 nm35) is much smaller compared with the typical diameter of
a compact condensate of T4 DNA (ca. 100 nm31); therefore, unfolding or diffusion of DNA condensates inside beads
cannot occur. Figure 6B shows corresponding FM images of beads containing short DNA with
an uneven distribution of fluorescence intensity, indicating persistence
of DNA in aggregated state.

DNA (A) and salmon sperm DNA (B) labeled with YOYO fluorescent dye
(green) and encapsulated into CaCO3 beads after deposition
of five polyelectrolyte layers ((PSS/PAH)2/PSS) on beads’

for multilayer construction. The images of beads dispersed in
Milli-Q water were recorded through a blue excitation filter B-2A
(Nikon) with longpass emission. Quasi-3D profiles of fluorescent intensities
are shown for representative beads marked with asterisk (*).

DNA Release into Hollow
Capsules
Finally, to dissolve
CaCO3 core and release DNA molecules into capsules, DNA-entrapped
beads with deposited multilayers were dialyzed against 0.1 M EDTA
solution. Figure 7 shows
fluorescence microscopy images of core-free capsules containing long
(Figure 7A) and short
(Figure 7B) DNA molecules.
Removal of the core resulted in substantial shrinking of the polyelectrolyte
capsule by ca. 1.5 times compared with the diameter of CaCO3 template (Figure 5A,B). For example, the average diameter of capsules with T4 DNA decreased
from ca. 12 to 7 μm. Shrinking of capsules containing a small
number of layers can be attributed to a loosely entangled structure
of polyelectrolyte molecules in multilayers deposited at relatively
high ionic strength that can undergo electrostatically driven rearrangement
under lower salt conditions. Shrinking/swelling of capsules is a complex
function of many solution parameters as well as multilayer assembly
history. About 10–30% shrinking of similar capsules was observed
in previous studies as a result of core removal36 or annealing37,38 due to postcompensation
of remaining free charges.

solution (pH 8) were recorded through a blue excitation filter B-2A
(Nikon) with longpass emission. Quasi-3D profiles of fluorescent intensities
are shown for representative beads marked with an asterisk (*). Red
fluorescence is from PAH labeled with Texas Red used for multilayer
construction. Histograms show diameter distributions of DNA-containing
capsules. (C) Schematic illustration of plausible T4 DNA (green) state
in polyelectrolyte capsules according to fluorescence microscopy observations.

No compact globules of T4 DNA
seen in Figure 6A were
observed inside the hollow capsules.
Instead, DNA fibers (green) typical for DNA in unfolded conformations
were found in most capsules (Figure 7A), indicating that dissolution of CaCO3 core triggered decompaction of DNA globules into coils. In most
capsules, T4 DNA attached to the walls of capsules and stretched toward
the center of capsules where high fluorescence from DNA was observed
(Figure 7A). Careful
observation of DNA localization and partitioning in capsules let us
propose the following scenario of DNA unfolding inside the capsules.
As illustrated by Figure 7C, it is suggested that, despite the overall negative
charge of the inner polyelectrolyte layer, the inner interface of
capsules contains cationic fragments of second-layer PAH with uncompensated
cationic charges, which results in electrostatic attachment of T4
DNA coil to the capsule wall. This is in a good agreement with earlier
studies that acknowledged the interpenetration of multilayer components
over length scales exceeding the thickness of a single layer39 as well as matrixlike structure of a capsule
wall suggesting protrusion of individual polyelectrolyte chains into
the interior of the capsule.34 At
the same time, the gross negative charge of capsules containing
the excess of anionic PSS causes repulsive interaction between the
encapsulated DNA and capsule wall, resulting in localization of the
remaining free DNA in the ca. 2 μm middle part of the confinement
far from the like-charged multilayer. Smaller capsules with diameters
of 3–4 μm possessed the same essential features as the
larger ones: attachment of DNA to the wall and partial concentration
in the middle of capsule (data not shown). It should be noted that
the contour length of T4 DNA (ca. 60 μm) is significantly larger
than the diameter of capsules (ca. 5 μm); thus, even a single-DNA
molecule can demonstrate such morphological features. However, the
results in Figure 4A that made clear encapsulation of multiple T4 DNA globules per CaCO3 bead suggest that DNA structures shown in Figure 7A are formed by several DNA
chains.

In contrast, localization of short DNA in capsules (Figure 7B) after dissolution
of the
sacrificial core was strikingly different from that of long T4 DNA.
The entire interior of the capsules was filled with DNA. In this case,
electrostatic interactions of short DNA and cationic domains in multilayers
are also possible, causing absorption of a small fraction of short
DNA on a capsule wall. Uniform distribution of short DNA inside capsules
is entropically driven, overcoming the effect of the electrostatic
repulsion of DNA from negatively charged walls, and the concentration
of short DNA in the center of capsules does not occur. Although no
large aggregates of DNA were observed in the hollow capsules,
the distribution of fluorescent signal from DNA appeared slightly
heterogenous with a higher intensity in the vicinity of the multilayered
wall. Appearance of the heterogeneity in short DNA localization can
be again attributed to the existence of polycationic fragments on
the inner surface of the multilayers that bind electrostatically with
short DNA forming complexes near capsule walls.

As shown above,
the length of DNA molecule plays an important role
and determines the DNA partitioning scenario in a microcapsule.

Conclusions
We successfully constructed a system confining
60 μm counter
length DNA in a 5–10 μm diameter polyelectrolyte capsule
by introducing an important DNA compaction step before its encapsulation.
This protocol enables encapsulation of both long and short DNAs with
almost quantitative entrapping efficiency. Being entrapped inside
sacrificial CaCO3 beads, long DNA preserves the conformation
that it exhibited before encapsulation. After dissolution of beads,
DNA unfolds adhering to the capsule wall and partly concentrating
in the central part of the capsule. Gaining control over electrostatic
properties of capsules to prevent DNA adhesion to the capsule wall
is an important future challenge for manipulation of DNA inside microconfinement.
Further development of such a system is promising for construction
of “artificial cell” models for better understanding
of DNA behavior in a living cell.

(PAH, Mw ∼75 000) were purchased
from Aldrich. Milli-Q water purified by Simplicity UV apparatus (Millipore,

Methods
 Brightfield and
Fluorescence Microscopies
Brightfield and fluorescence
microscopy observations were performed
on an Eclipse TE 2000-U microscope (Nikon Instruments Inc.) equipped
with a blue excitation B-2A filter (Nikon Instruments Inc.) with longpass
emission (excitation 450–490 nm, cutoff wavelength 500 nm,
and barrier filter wavelength 515 nm) and oil-immersed ×100 or
×40 objective lens. YOYO-labeled T4 DNA molecules were illuminated
with a mercury lamp, and fluorescent images were observed and recorded
on a EB-CCD monochrome camera using an Argus 10 image processor system
(Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan). Fluorescence images of beads containing
DNA and multilayers and capsules were recorded on a Nikon DS-Ri1 digital
camera and analyzed using a Micron Optics image-analysis system and
NIS-Elements BR 3.1 software. The focal plane of beads’ and
capsules’ images was chosen at approximately the center of
the bead/capsule height.

The size of DNA molecules and beads
was measured using ImageJ 1.52i software (NIH). The apparent long-axis
length of the T4 DNA molecule in solution was measured as the longest
distance in the outline of DNA molecule fluorescence images of single-DNA
chain. The diameter of beads and capsules was measured at approximately
the center of bead/capsule height.

Fluorescence Spectroscopy
Fluorescent spectra of T4
DNA and salmon sperm DNA labeled with YOYO-1 were recorded on an FP-6600
spectrofluorimeter (Jasco, Japan) in 1 cm optical path quartz
cells at room temperature.

Sample Preparations
Fluorescence
Labeling of PAH with Texas Red Fluorescent Dye
First, 10
mL of 10 g/L PAH solution (pH 8.6) was mixed with a 250
μL solution of Texas Red-X succinimidyl ester in dimethyl sulfoxide
for 1 h. The resulted solution was dialyzed two times against 1 mM
NaCl solution (0.5 L) using membrane tubing with molecular weight
cutoff (MWCOs) of 12 000–14 000 Da. After dialysis,
the labeled PAH was stored in fridge at 4 °C.

DNA Entrapment
into CaCO3 Microparticles
To 1 mL solution of
T4 DNA (10 μM) in TE buffer, a 10 μL
solution of YOYO-1 fluorescent dye (100 μM) was added and gently
mixed. Next, a 50 μL solution of spermine (0.1 M) was added
and the sample was incubated for at least 15 min. Into 10 mL of Milli-Q
water, 3 mL of 0.67 M Na2CO3 and 3 mL of 0.67
M CaCl2 solutions were added and rapidly mixed under vigorous
stirring (500 rpm) for 10–15 s. Solution of labeled DNA with
spermine was quickly added to the solution of Na2CO3 and CaCl2, stirring was stopped, and the precipitate
was allowed to settle down for 10 min. The precipitate was separated
by decantation, washed twice with Milli-Q water (50 mL) and once with
ethanol (30 mL), and dried at 60–70 °C in a convection
oven for 3 h. Drying of DNA-entrapped beads is important to avoid
their recrystallization from mesoporous vaterite to monocrystal calcite
phase accompanied with a release of encapsulated cargo.34 Thermal denaturation of long bacteriophage DNA
in aqueous solutions takes place between 60 and 80 °C;40 however, in the presence of multivalent cations,
the resistance of DNA toward thermal denaturation significantly increases.41 The obtained CaCO3 beads containing
encapsulated DNA were stored in a dry box at a relative humidity of
10–20%. Entrapment of salmon sperm DNA (ca. 300 bp) into beads
was performed using the same protocol as that described above for
T4 DNA.

Construction of a PSS-PAH Multilayered Capsule
A multilayer
of polyelectrolytes was sequentially deposited on CaCO3 beads according to the standard layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition
procedure.42 PSSNa and PAH were dissolved
in 0.5 M NaCl solution at 1 g/L concentrations. Solution of PAH labeled
with Texas Red fluorescent dye was added to PAH solution at a molar
ratio of 1:1000. CaCO3 beads (0.1 g) containing DNA were
dispersed into 0.5 mL of 0.1 M NaCl solution; 9.5 mL of PSSNa (0.1
g/L) solution was added, vigorously mixed, and incubated for 5 min.
The resulted beads were separated by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for
3 min and washed twice with 10 mL of 0.1 M NaCl solution followed
by separation by centrifuging to remove nonbound polyelectrolytes.
Alternating adsorption of PSSNa and PAH layers followed by washing
with 10 mL of 0.1 M NaCl solution was repeated to deposit five-layered
((PSS/PAH)2/PSS) multilayer film on beads’ surfaces
using 10 mL of 1 g/L solution of polyelectrolytes.

To dissolve
CaCO3 core, microbeads with deposited multilayers were
separated and resuspended in 2 mL of distilled water and dialyzed
twice against 50 mL of 0.1 M EDTA solution (pH 8.0) using a slide-A-Lyzer
MINI dialysis device (MWCO 20 000 Da). The resulted suspension
of capsules was further dialyzed two times against 50 mL of distilled
water, one time against 50 mL of TE buffer (pH 8.0), and finally stored
in a fridge at 4 °C.
