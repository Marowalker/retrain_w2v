The poor compatibility of an inorganic electron transport
layer
with the active layer and an ultrathin film organic material becomes
a great obstacle in producing high-quality polymer solar cells with
high-throughput roll-to-roll (R2R) method. Novel effective polymer
solar cells had been fabricated by introducing 1, 7-disubstituted
perylene diimide derivatives PDIH, PDIC,
and PDIN as an electron transporting layer. It was noteworthy
that PDIN could obviously improve the power conversion
efficiency of solar cells that incorporated a photoactive layer composed
of poly[(3-hexylthiophene)-2, 5-diyl] (P3HT) and the
fullerene acceptor [6, 6-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl
ester] (PC71BM).
The power conversion efficiency varies from 1.5% for ZnO transparent
cathode-based solar cells to 2.1% for PDIN-based electron
transport layer-free solar cells. This improved performance could
be attributed to the following reasons: the interaction between N
atom in PDIN and O atom in indium tin oxide (ITO) reduced
the work function of ITO, increased the built-in electric field, and
thus lowered the electron transport barrier and improved the electron
extraction ability of cathode, the appropriate roughness of the active
layer increased the contact area with anode interfacial layer and
enhanced the hole transport efficiency. These experimental results
revealed that PDIN can be a promising novel effective
material with a simplified synthesis process and lower cost as an
electron transporting layer.

1 Introduction
Polymeric solar cells
(PSCs) based on the photoactive layer have
gained widespread attention due to their lightweight, flexibility,
low cost, and easy large-area production in green energy.1−8 The highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has approached
a milestone value of 12% with emerging materials and optimizing processes.9−14 PSCs are generally sandwich structures with cathode (collecting
electrons), electron transport layers (ETLs), active layer (a mixture
of conjugated polymers and fullerenes, and the most core structure),
hole transport layer (transporting holes, directly contacting the
active layer and the anode), and anode (collecting holes).15−19 The electron transport layer is one of the most important guarantees
for constructing efficient PSCs. It plays a key role in active layer
electron extraction, the dipole of interface adjustment, and electron
transmission energy barrier reduction. A low work function metal (such
as Ca) was inserted between the active metal (such Al as a cathode)
and the active layer, which significantly improved PCE of PSCs.20−24 However, the PSCs lifetime is extremely short for the sensitivity
of Ca on water vapor and oxygen, and such ETL is generally applied
to the upright PSCs. In addition, the hole transport layer of upright
PSCs is generally poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate)
(PEDOT:PSS) with strong acidity and hygroscopicity in air, which will
further corrode the indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode and reduce resistance
to air. Inverted PSCs were developed to overcome the air sensitivity
of the active metal cathode and the acidity of PEDOT:PSS.25,26 The air-stabilized high-work function metals (e.g., Au, Ag) collect
holes as an anode and ITO as a cathode to collect electrons, and the
stability and efficiency of the battery are simultaneously improved.27,28 What is more, n-type semiconductor metal oxides (such as ZnO, TiO2) are inserted between the cathode and the active layer, which
function as holes blocking an optical spacer and the self-assembled
layer.23,29,30 However, due
to its own intrinsic structure, the contact between the inorganic
oxide and the active layer is poor, resulting in poor electron transport
capability of the PSCs. Therefore, organic materials have been developed
as a promising ETL.

In inverted PSCs, the conjugated polymers
and small molecule compounds
are used as ETL to replace the metal oxides due to their advantages,
such as appropriate interfacial dipole formation suitable for matching
the work function between the active layer and the cathode, excellent
solubility in different solvents to allow fabricating of multilayer
by solution process, and easy modification of chemical and physical
properties by altering the side chains.31−33 The latter ones are
relatively attractive due to the properties of simple manufacturing
processes, precise molecular weight, monodispersity, and unaffected
by end groups to prepare PSCs with high batch repeatability. For example,
fullerene modified by different side chains of pyrrole salt, pyrrolidine,
tertiary amine, ammonium salt, and fluorinated alkyl have been successfully
designed and synthesized.34−36 Another successful and advantageous
interlayers are the derivatives of perylene imide used as ETL, which
are stable to thermal stability and light due to its special molecular
structure.37−39 Having the good planarity of the molecules and enhancement
of π–π interaction between molecules, the electron
migration ability is strengthened. Besides, the perylene imide derivatives
facilitate PSCs PCE and assembly with the advantages of photochemical
stability, strong electron affinity, easy modification, and simple
synthesis. However, the poor film-forming property, low solubility,
and weak solvent resistance restrict further development. When constructing
an inverted PSCs multilayer structure, solvent resistance is particularly
important. It is necessary to synthesize an alcohol/water-soluble
ETL to resist corrosion from the active layer solvent. So far, most
of the literature has introduced the alkyl and amino groups into the
ends of perylene imide to gain alcohol or water solubility with great
progress.40−42 Compared to the main chain, bay region modifications
of perylene imide are rare, which is more direct to affect the solubility
in alcohol or water.

In this paper, we synthesized three derivatives
of phthalimide
with different side-chain modifications by reacting dibromophthalimide
derivatives with different phenol derivatives (PDIH, PDIC, and PDIN) Figure 1. Preliminary studies by UV–visible
absorption spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry(CV) showed that PDIP-N has good film-forming properties and alcohol or water
solubility. The introduction of an o-methylphenoxy substituent at
the bay position of PDI can alter the electron-withdrawing
capability of the backbone, significantly increasing the reduction
potential, thereby increasing or decreasing the lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO). Compared to PDIH and PDIC, we introduced the amine group into PDIN to improve the solubility in methanol and ensure that it is not
corroded by the active layer solvent and facilitates solution processing.
We further used PDIN as the electron transport layer
of PSCs based on P3HT:PC71BM; it is found that the PCE with PDIN as ETL is significantly higher than that of ZnO, while PDIH and PDIC are much lower. The water contact angle, ultraviolet
photoelectron spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) reveal
that the interaction between PDIN and cathode reduced
the work function of ITO and reduced the barrier of electron transport
to the cathode. The roughness of the active layer increases appropriately
will significantly accelerate charge transport in active layer and
achieve higher efficiency PSCs. These results reveal that water or
alcohol-soluble PDI derivatives can be obtained by introducing
various polar groups in the bay region, which can inspire the development
of ETL for high-efficiency PSCs.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Fabrication of PSCs
P3HT and PC71BM were
obtained from Suna Tech Inc (www.SunaTechInc.com). The configuration of the ETL-free PSCs
was ITO/P3HT:PC71BM:ETLs/MoO3/Ag, the normal inverted PSCs
structure was ITO/ETLs/P3HT:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag. The ITO substrate
was sequentially washed by an ultrasonic machine for 15 minutes with
different solvents (detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl
alcohol). The ZnO layer is spin-coated with a nano-ZnO precursor solution
at 1500 rpm for 30 s on a spin coater, followed by annealing at 200
°C for 30 minutes. The concentration of PDIN in methanol was
0.5 mg mL–1 and it was annealed at 150 °C for
10 min. Thereafter, P3HT/PC71BM solution (D/A weight ratio
is 1:1) or P3HT/PC71BM/ETL solution (P3HT/PC71BM/ETL = 40:40:1 wt) with the concentration in chlorobenzene is 20
mg mL–1 is used as the active layer. The active
layer was spin-coated at 800 rpm for 30 s. Finally, the MoO3 (10 nm) and Ag (100 nm) layers were evaporated in a vacuum chamber
at a basic pressure of 1 × 10 –5.

2.2 Characterization
Nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spectra of all materials were obtained using a Bruker
ARX MHz spectrometer (500 and 125MHz) with tetramethylsilane as the
internal reference. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed
using a TA(Q600SDT) apparatus at a heating rate of 10 °C min –1. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was carried
out on a Netzsch DSC200F3 at a heating rate of 10 °C min–1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. UV–visible absorption
spectra were obtained using a Varian Cary 300 spectrophotometer. All
films were uniformly coated on the ITO substrate. Work functions (WFs)
of ITO substrates with different modifications were obtained using
Thermo Scientific (EscaLab 250Xi). The water contact angle was measured
on SDC-200 and the water was used as a test liquid. Surface morphology
was determined by a Dimension Icon AFM instrument (Bruker). PSCs devices
were characterized at room temperature under simulated AM 1.5 G conditions
(Xe Lamp Oriel Sol3A Class AAA Solar Simulators 94023A) and calibrated
to a certified Si reference cell with a KG-5 filter (PV Measurements,
PVM624). J–V characteristics
and charge carrier mobility were performed on a computer-controlled
Keithley 2400 source meter. The external quantum efficiency (EQE)
was measured on a QEPVSI-B measurement system (Newport).

2.3 Synthesis of PDIH, PDIC, and PDIN
The synthetic routes of target materials PDIH, PDIC, and PDIN are shown in Scheme 1. The substitution
reaction of 1 and phenol derivative gave the target compound PDIH, PDIC, and PDIN in a good yield
of 78.5, 81.0, and 65.0%, respectively.43,44 The molecular
structures of PDIH, PDIC, and PDIN were determined by NMR.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Characterization of PDIH, PDIC, and PDIN
The thermal stability and electrochemical
properties of PDIH, PDIC, and PDIN were acquired by TGA and CV, respectively. The corresponding characterization
are depicted in Figure 2. We found that PDIH, PDIC, and PDIN had good thermal stability and the onset of the weight loss at 165,
172, and 208 °C, rsespectively. These materials meet the minimum
temperature for device fabrication. Even if PDIH and PDIC are used to prepare ETL-free solar cells and anneal at
150 °C, which was much lower than the onset of the weight loss
temperature of the two materials. The electron transport layer PDIN/methanol solution anneals at 150 °C and also satisfies
the preparation temperature of the device, ensuring strong thermal
stability.

Figure 2 (a) Thermal-gravimetric analysis curves of PDIH, PDIC, and PDIN. (b) Cyclic voltammetry of PDIH, PDIC, and PDIN coated on the
glassy carbon electrode.

We also tested the electrochemical performance
of PDIH, PDIC, and PDIN by
cyclic voltammetry.
The glassy carbon electrode is working electrode, the platinum plate
was used as the auxiliary electrode, Ag/Ag+ was the reference
electrode, and ferrocene was used as a standard material. The electrolyte
was a tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate/acetonitrile solution
at a concentration of 0.1 mmol mL–1. In addition,
a film was prepared by PDIH/chloroform, PDIC/chloroform, and PDIN/methanol by deposition on a working
electrode. The cyclic voltammetry curves of the three materials are
shown in Figure 2b.
It could be concluded that the initial oxidation potential (Eox) and the initial reduction potential (Ered) of PDIH were 0.87 and −0.69
V, while the Eox and Ered of PDIC were 0.90 and −0.73 V,
and Eox and Ered of PDIN were 0.91 and −0.75 V, respectively.
The electrochemical band gap of the three perylene diimide derivatives
was calculated by the formula: EHOMO =
−(Eox + 4.4) eV, ELUMO = −(Ered + 4.4)eV.
The calculated values are given in Table 1, and the electrochemical band gap and the
optical band gap were basically matched. It could be calculated that EHOMO and ELUMO of PDIH were −5.27 and −3.71 eV, in the same time, EHOMO and ELUMO of PDIC were −5.30 and −3.67 eV, and EHOMO and ELUMO of PDIN were −5.31 and −3.65 eV, respectively.45,46 The UV–visible absorption spectra of PDIH, PDIC, and PDIN are shown in Figure 3a and tested at room temperature.
The materials were dissolved in chloroform and spin-coated on quartz
glass to form a film. In the solution state, the maximum absorption
peak of PDIH, PDIC, and PDIN were 545, 548, and 544 nm, respectively. The absorption of photons
by the three substances in the solution state was similar. The absorption
spectrum of PDIC was red-shifted compared to PDIH, while the PDIN was blue-shifted. The substituents
affect the conjugation effect of perylene diimide, resulting in changing
in the maximum absorption wavelength. The propyl group of PDIC plays the role of a electron-donating group, which increases π–π
conjugation, while the nitrogen atom of the PDIN side
chain reduces the conjugation effect of perylene diimide. However,
in the film state, the maximum absorption peak of PDIH, PDIC, and PDIN were 562, 563, and 569
nm, respectively. It is known that the maximum absorption of PDIH and PDIC were not of much differences, but
red shift occurred significantly compared to solution status, because
in the state of film, the aggregation of material is much greater
than that of the solution.47,48 In addition, the red
shift of PDIN was stronger than that of PDIH and PDIC in film, this could contribute to stronger
π–π stacking by the induction of nitrogen atoms.
According to the optical band gap formula ΔE = hc/λ, the optical band gaps of PDIH, PDIC, and PDIN were 1.93, 1.97, and 1.90
eV, respectively.

3.2 Photovoltaic Properties of PSCs
To
explore the photovoltaic performance of PDIH, PDIC, and PDIN as electron transport layers, we constructed
the device structures of ITO/ZnO/P3HT:PC71BM:(PDIH, or PDIC)/MoO3/Ag and ITO/ETLs/P3HT:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag. The PSCs device was optimized under sunlight (AM 1.5 G, 1000
W m–2) illumination. The photovoltaic characteristics,
external quantum efficiency (EQE), and electron mobility curves of
PSCs are shown in Figure 3. At the same time, Table 2 also listed the corresponding performance parameters
of different PSCs. The traditional PSCs with ZnO as ETL obtained a JSC of 5.78 mA cm–2, VOC of 0.56 V, FF of 0.48, and PCE of 1.46%,
The ETL-free PSCs with P3HT:PC71BM:PDIH as active showed
a JSC of 2.80 mA cm–2, VOC of 0.56 V, FF of 0.42, and PCE
of 0.65%. The ETL-free PSCs with P3HT:PC71BM:PDIC obtained
a JSC of 2.48 mA cm–2, VOC of 0.56 V, FF
of 0.36, and PCE of 0.46%. What is more, the PSCs with PDIN as ETL showed a JSC of 6.32 mA cm–2, VOC of 0.57 V, FF of
0.61, and PCE of 2.08%. The energy conversion efficiency of PDIN solar cells is significantly higher than that of PDIH and PDIC cells, mainly due to the higher
short-circuit current and fill factor of PDIN.

When sunlight hits the surface of PSCs, the active
layer material
generates excitons and then the excitons diffuse to D/A interfaces,
dissociating free electrons and hole pairs, EQE spectra is shown in Figure 3c, EQE of PDIN and ZnO was obviously higher than that of PDIH and PDIC, while the absorption efficiency of PDIN was slightly higher than that of ZnO, which also corresponded to
the photoelectric characteristic curve. Due to the high photon conversion
efficiency and electron transport efficiency, the short-circuit current
of the PDIN PSCs was improved and energy conversion efficiency
was higher.

To test the electron mobility of PSCs, we assembled
the device
structure containing only electrons ITO/ZnO/P3HT:PC71BM/Al, ITO/P3HT:PC71BM:PDIH/Al, ITO/P3HT:PC71BM:PDIC/Al, and ITO/PDIN /P3HT:PC71BM/Al. The electron mobility test is displayed
in Figure 3d. The electron
mobility calculation was calculated according to the Mott–Gurney
equation using the space charge limited current (SCLC) model.49−51  where J is current density,
μ is the charge carrier mobility, d is film
thickness of active layer (110 nm), εr is the relative dielectric constant of the transport medium,
ε0 is the dielectric constant of the free space (8.854
× 10–12 m–1), and V is the applied voltage. The electron mobility of PSCs
modified with ZnO, PDIH, PDIC, and PDIN were 5.26 × 10–5, 2.45 ×
10–6, 1.89 × 10–6, and 8.28
× 10–5 cm2 V–1 S–1, respectively.

3.3 Interfacial Modification on ITO Electrode
The ETLs act as an interface material between the active layer
and cathode and affect the work function of ITO straightly. To understand
the role of ETLs in promoting the photovoltaic characteristics of
PSCs, energy-level alignment of the active layer and ITO surface was
studied by using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) (He
I line, hν = 21.2 eV). Figure 4 presented the UPS spectra of the active
layer surface and ITO. The work function (WF) is calculated as hν – (Ecutoff – Eonset), where hν is the
excitation source energy, Ecutoff is the
abscissa of cutoff inflection point, and Eonset is abscissa of starting
inflection point. The ITO work function was reported as 4.6 eV. It
could be concluded that the work function of ITO/ZnO, ITO/PDIH, ITO/PDIC, and ITO/PDIN were 4.28, 4.49,
4.54, and 4.05 eV. The data of the work function are summarized in Table 3. The WF of ITO was
reduced differently after modified by three perylene diimide derivatives.
The reduction in work function insure a good ohmic contact between
the ITO interfacial layer and the fullerene acceptor while increasing
the built-in electric field of PSCs to achieve higher open circuit
voltage. At the same time, the lower WF reduces the electron transfer
energy barrier, enhancing the electron collection capability of the
cathode and reducing the recombination rate of the active layer carriers.

photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) spectra of ITO/ZnO,
(b) ITO/PDIH, (c) ITO/PDIC, (d) ITO/PDIN films, and (e) ITO/different active layer.

Table 3 Surface Work Function of ITO and Different
Active Layer
structure	work function
(eV)	
ITO/ZnO	4.28	
ITO/PDIH	4.49	
ITO/PDIC	4.54	
ITO/PDIN	4.05	
ITO/P3HT:PC71BM	4.46	
ITO/P3HT:PC71BM:PDIH	4.20	
ITO/P3HT:PC71BM:PDIC	4.29	
We also determined the effect of PDIH and PDIC on the surface WF of the active layer. The
WF of ITO/P3HT:PC71BM, ITO/P3HT:PC71BM:PDIH, and ITO/P3HT:PC71BM:PDIC were 4.46, 4.2, and 4.29 eV, respectively.
According to the characterization results, the secondary electron
cutoff edge of PDIH mixing with an active layer is more
positively moved forward than that of PDIC, which increased
the binding energy and lowered the vacuum level. These results indicate
that charge-mediated dipole is formed on the surface of the active
layer, which enhances the charge transfer of the active layer, making PDIH a higher photoelectric conversion efficiency comparing
to PDIC cells.52

Considering
that the surface energy of the film plays an important
role in the sequential deposition in the multilayer devices, we studied
the wettability of the three materials by measuring the water contact
angle. The measurement was carried out on the surface of the film
by dropping deionized (DI) water, and the contact angle was determined
by automatic image analysis. Figure 5 exhibited the images of ZnO (77°), PDIH (81.5°), PDIC (92.3°), PDIN (92.5°), P3HT:PC71BM (98°), P3HT:PC71BM:PDIH (99°), P3HT:PC71BM:PDIC (103°), and bare ITO (75.5°). Figure 5b–h shows all UV-treated samples.
Detailed results are summarized in Table 4.

Since PSCs are a “sandwich” structure,
it possess
different hydrophobicity. To a certain extent, the stronger hydrophobicity
of interface between ITO and active layer is, the better ductility
and phase separation of the active layer on top of ITO. It is worth
noting that the contact angles of PDIH and PDIC increased and there is not much difference in the surface energies,
respectively. The hydrophilicity of ITO increased after UV treatment,
which enhanced the water contact angle and facilitated the spin coating
of the ZnO solution. The water contact angle and hydrophobicity increased
after annealing at 200 °C. In addition, the contact angle of
ITO was increased with surface energy 35.23 mN m–1 after the modification of PDIN, which was slightly
larger than ZnO, indicating good ohmic contact between the ETLs and
active layer. Among them, the contact angle and surface energy of
active layer mixed with PDIH or PDIC were
similar, instructing that the hydrophobicity of the active layer was
not greatly affected.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was employed
to research the surface
morphology of the active layer coated on different ETLs and displayed
in Figure 6. The root
mean square (rms) roughness of different PSCs structure with P3HT:PC71BM, ZnO/P3HT:PC71BM, P3HT:PC71BM:PDIH, P3HT:PC71BM:PDIC, and PDIN/P3HT:PC71BM were 0.74,
0.71, 1.2, 0.93, and 0.79 nm, respectively. Compared to ZnO PSCs,
the roughness of PDIH, PDIC, and PDIN PSCs increased by 0.49, 0.22, and 0.08 nm, respectively. Appropriate
roughness enhances the internal interaction of active layer and hole
transport rate, effectively decreasing the charge transport distance
and increasing JSC, which increases the
nanoscale texture, further enhances internal light scattering and
light absorption. After laying on the box for 1 h, the fill factor
tends to increase.53 Therefore, standing
and longer annealing times may help remove residual solvent, reduce
free volume, and improve interfacial contact with the electrode.

4 Conclusions
In summary, we designed
and synthesized a novel material PDIN, which could be
used to fabricate effective inverted
PSCs. The PCE of PDIN was enhanced significantly compared
to ZnO-modified PSCs. The improvements of PSCs performance was attributed
to the following factors: the appropriate roughness of active layer
increased the contact area with the hole transport layer and reduced
the energy barrier of charge transport, the interaction between N
atom in PDIN and O atom in ITO decreased the work function
of ITO, which increased the built-in electric field and promoted the
ability of electron extraction. These results show that by simply
introducing polar chemical groups in the bay region can gain high
conductive cathode interfacial material for effective PSCs.
