Predicting the nonideal
phase behavior of binary and multicomponent
systems remains a significant challenge for particle-based simulations.
Here, we develop a transferable force field for chloroethenes, common
environmental contaminants, that can accurately model the vapor liquid
phase equilibria including azeotrope formation. The new all-atom force
field reproduces saturated liquid densities, saturated vapor pressures,
boiling points, and critical properties within 1, 10, 1, and 1% of
the experiment data, respectively. Furthermore, the vapor liquid equilibria
of trichloroethylene and 1-propanol binary mixture, which forms a
minimum boiling point azeotrope, is predicted with a reasonable accuracy.
The microstructure of neat and binary systems is explored using pair
correlation functions and spatial distribution functions. As the new
force field is consistent with transferable potentials for phase equilibria
(TraPPE) force field, it expands the applicability of TraPPE force
field to chloroethenes.

1 Introduction
The
lack of clean groundwater presents a significant challenge
in meeting the growing demand for water for agricultural, commercial,
and industrial needs. Most countries, depending on their stage of
economic development and hydrogeological conditions, are facing groundwater
contamination problems.1,2 In particular, the contamination
of groundwater due to chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons is becoming
an important environmental concern in regions with significant industrial
activity. Chlorinated compounds are extensively used in a large number
of industrial processes especially as solvents, degreasing agents,
paint removers, adhesives, lubricants, rug-cleaning fluids, pharmaceuticals,
and pesticides.3 Because of the extensive
use of chloroethenes, these compounds are widely distributed in sediments,
soils, and the groundwater.3−5 Chloroethene compounds include
chloroethylene or vinyl chloride, cis-1,2-dichloroethylene, trans-1,2-dichloroethylene, 1,1-dichloroethylene, trichloroethylene
(TCE), and tetrachloroethylene (PCE). Among chloroethenes, TCE and
PCE are the major contaminants which are frequently found in the groundwater.
In this family of compounds, TCE is considered to be the most hazardous
and is a known human carcinogen.6 The presence
of dichlorinated ethylene isomers in the water is mainly due to the
microbial transformations of TCE and PCE. Often, PCE and TCE readily
undergo anaerobic reduction reactions, which lead to substitution
of chlorine by hydrogen to yield dichlorinated and chloroethene compounds.7,8

Determination of accurate physicochemical properties of chloroethenes
is essential for predicting its environmental impact and designing
separation processes. With the increase in computational power and
improvements in the force fields, molecular simulations play an important
role in computing thermophysical properties.9 Given the importance of chloroethenes, they have been the subject
of numerous computational works. In some of the adsorption studies,10−12 the C and H interaction parameters were taken from previous Monte
Carlo studies that reported good heat of adsorption of methane in
zeolites.13,14 The parameters for chlorine were derived
from Lennard-Jones (LJ) parameters of argon as Ar and Cl have similar
atomic radii and polarizabilities.10 As
such, there are no force field developed specifically for chloroethenes,
but some studies15,16 have used optimized potential
for liquid simulations (OPLS)17-type force
field for chloroalkenes. Dellis et al.18 examined the accuracy of OPLS force field for cis and trans-1,2-dichloroethene compounds. The computed
thermophysical properties differ significantly from the experimental
data. This force field underestimates the saturated liquid density
by 1.3–1.6% for cis isomer and 2.3–2.7% for the trans
isomer.18 This led authors to develop a
new force field by refining the parameters against the available experimental
data to investigate the solvation structure and dynamics of both the
isomers in supercritical carbon dioxide. Luo and Farrell19 used universal force field20,21 for TCE and PCE to study how pH of the solution affects adsorption
of these compounds on iron surfaces.

As most of the previous
work has involved developing force field
for specific chloroethene molecules with limited state point transferability,
there is a need for an accurate force field that is consistent across
chlorosubstituted ethenes. Here, we develop a transferable force field
for chloroethenes, which can accurately predict thermophysical properties
such as vapor liquid coexistence curves, critical properties, and
azeotrope compositions. In this work, the force field for chloroethenes
is derived from the transferable potential for phase equilibria22 (TraPPE) force field. We used all-atom representation
for chloroethenes in order to provide a more accurate description
of charge distribution.23−25

The article is arranged
in the following manner. Section 2 describes the force field
parameterization for chloroethenes. Section 3 provides the simulation details for computing
the phase behavior of neat and binary systems. In section 4, the vapor liquid coexistence
curves, saturated vapor pressure plot, critical properties, and binary
vapor–liquid equilibrium diagram at different pressures, aggregate
analysis, and structural investigations are presented. Finally, section 5 presents the concluding
remarks.

2 Force Field Development
The TraPPE
force field uses 12-6 LJ and Coulomb potentials to model
the nonbonded interactions 1  where rij, ϵij, σij, qi, qj, and ϵ0 are
the separation between two interaction sites, LJ well
depth, LJ size, partial charges on sites i and j, and the permittivity of a vacuum, respectively. Our parameterization
approach involves adjusting nonbond interaction parameters to match
the experimental density and saturated vapor pressures of selected
molecules. There are three different types of bonding environments
for the family of chloroethene compounds. The first and second types
of carbon bonding environments are with carbon bonded to two hydrogen
(C[H2]) and chlorine (C[Cl2]) atoms, respectively,
and the third interaction type consists of carbon bonded to one hydrogen
and one chlorine atom (C[ClH]). Depending on the substitution on the
carbon atom, specific LJ parameters, σ and ϵ, for the
carbon atom are assigned. For chlorine and hydrogen, the sigma and
epsilon parameters are the same for all compounds, and there were
taken from the TraPPE force field.25 The
LJ parameters for the carbon atom (C[H2]) and (C[Cl2]) were parametrized to match pure component properties for
ethylene and PCE. Subsequently, the carbon LJ parameters (C[ClH])
were parametrized to match pure component properties for chloroethylene
and TCE. In order to validate the force field, pure component fluid
properties for cis-1-2 dichloroethylene, trans-1-2 dichloroethylene, and 1,1-dichloroethylene were
predicted and compared against the available experimental data.

The intramolecular and intermolecular parameters are listed in Tables 1 and 2. The interactions among unlike atoms are calculated with
the Lorentz–Berthelot combining rules. 2   3

The TraPPE force field
includes intramolecular nonbond interaction
terms only between atoms separated by four or more bonds. Thus, in
the present set of molecules there are no intramolecular nonbond interactions.
Bonds were considered rigid with equilibrium bond length obtained
from electronic structure calculations (see below). For bend angle
and torsional potentials, a harmonic term is used to control the angle: 4   5  where
θ and ϕ are the bend and
torsional angle, respectively, θ0 and ϕ0 are the equilibrium bend and torsional angle, respectively,
and kθ and ϕ0 are
the bend and torsional force constants, respectively. The torsional
equilibrium angle (ϕ0) was kept zero and π
for cis and trans configurations of the molecules, respectively. The
bending and torsional force constants were calculated by fitting eqs 4 and 5 to the ab initio potential energy curve calculated at the second-order
MP2 level of theory26,27 and Dunning’s augmented
correlation-consistent polarized valence triple zeta basis set of
contracted Gaussian functions (aug-cc-pVTZ).28,29

Additional ab initio geometry optimization calculations were
performed
using the M06-2X30 density functional with
aug-cc-pVTZ basis set to determine equilibrium geometry and partial
atomic charges. M06-2X density functional performs better than other
density functionals for modeling short- to medium-range correlation.30 For partial atomic charge calculations, 1-octanol
is used as the universal continuum solvent in the condensed phase.24,25 Atomic charges for different atoms of various compounds are listed
in Table 3. Figure 1 shows the molecular
structure of all compounds and atom numbering corresponding to the
atomic charge listed in Table 3. All ab initio calculations were performed using the Gaussian
09 program.31

3 Simulation Details
3.1 Single Component Vapor Liquid Coexistence
Curves
A combination of Gibbs ensemble Monte Carlo (GEMC)32−34 method and coupled–decoupled configurational-bias Monte Carlo
(CBMC)35−38 was used to determine vapor liquid coexistence curves for all compounds.
The canonical version of the GEMC method32 uses two boxes in thermodynamic contact without a direct interface.
GEMC simulations employ different move types to equilibrate the system,
namely, translational, rotational, configurational-bias molecule regrowth,
volume exchange between the boxes, and molecule swap. Molecules are
swapped between boxes to equilibrate the chemical potential, volume
exchange moves equilibrate the pressure (mechanical equilibrium),
and translational, rotational, and configurational-bias regrowth moves
within a particular box establish thermal equilibrium. For all state
points, the probability of different moves are as follows: volume
(0.2%), swap (24.8–29.8%), configurational (10–15%),
translational (30%), and rotational (30%). Configurational bias and
swap moves have used 10 and 15 choices during all regrowth and trial
insertion of the molecules. The bend and torsional angles were chosen
from 1000 and 100 random trial configurations during the CBMC regrowth.
Each MC cycles consists of N moves, where N is the total number of molecules in the system. The total
number of molecules for each system is listed in Table 4. A cutoff (rcut) of 14 Å was used for the liquid box with analytical
tail correction to account for the interaction energy beyond the cutoff.39 To compute Coulombic interactions, Ewald summation
with the tin foil boundary condition39,40 was used,
and the cutoff for the real-space part of Ewald summation was set
to rcut. The Ewald sum convergence parameter
κ was set to 3.2/rcut. The size
of the vapor box was adjusted during the equilibrium run, so that
20–40 molecules can be found in the vapor phase. In addition,
we increased the cutoff for the real-space part of the Ewald summation
for the vapor box in order to lower the number of reciprocal space
vectors, which results in reducing the computation time required for
the simulation. A minimum of 50 000–100 000 MC
cycles was used to equilibrate the system. After equilibration, the
production runs were carried out for 100 000 MC cycles. Standard
deviation of the ensemble averages were obtained by breaking the production
runs into five blocks.

From the vapor liquid coexistence curve data, the
critical temperature
and critical density were computed by using density scaling law41 and the law of rectilinear diameter42 6   7  where A and B are the fitting constants and β = 0.325 is the critical
exponent.
In addition, the normal boiling point for each compound was calculated
via Clausius–Clapeyron (CC) equation. The liquid structure
was analyzed using radial distribution function (RDF), angular radial
distribution function (ARDF), and three-dimensional spatial distribution
function (SDF). The details of ARDF and SDF calculations can be found
in our previous work.25,43−46

3.2 Vapor
Liquid Equilibria for Binary Mixtures
In order to check the
transferability of the force field, we determined
the vapor liquid equilibria (VLE) for binary systems of trichloroethylene/1-propanol
and trichloroethylene/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The VLE was computed
at 20 and 100 kPa for trichloroethylene/1-propanol and at 95.3 kPa
for trichloroethylene/DMSO system. Force field parameters for 1-propanol
were taken from Chen et al. TraPPE UA.47 For modeling DMSO, the ketone oxygen and methyl group LJ parameters
were taken from TraPPE force field, whereas the sulfur LJ parameters
and partial atomic charges were taken from the OPLS force field.48−50 The system size for binary systems consists of 440 molecules in
total. We used the isothermal–isobaric (NPT)51 version of GEMC to simulate the binary systems. The move
probabilities and cutoff were similar to that described in the previous
section for the canonical version of GEMC. The systems were equilibrated
for 150 000–200 000 MC cycles, and the production
runs were performed for at least 200 000 MC cycles.

4 Results and Discussion
4.1 Single Component Vapor
Liquid Coexistence
Curves
The vapor liquid coexistence curves (VLCCs), saturated
vapor pressure curves (SVPCs), and heat of vaporization curves (HOVCs)
for all chloroethene compounds are shown in Figure 2. The plots for ethylene, chloroethylene,
trichloroethylene, and tetrachloroethylene are shown in Figure 2A,C,E, respectively, where
carbon LJ parameters were adjusted to the pure component fluid properties
according to the carbon bonding environment. For all of these compounds,
the mean unsigned percentage error for saturated liquid densities
and vapor pressure is less than 1 and 10%, respectively. The simulation
data (ρliq, ρvap, pvap, and ΔHvap) matches
well with the available experimental data.52−56 To assess the transferability of the force field
parameters, the predicted VLCCs, SVPCs, and HOVCs for cis-1-2-dichloroethylene, trans-1-2-dichloroethylene,
and 1,1-dichloroethylene compound are shown in Figure 2B,D,F. For trans-1-2-dichloroethylene
and 1,1-dichloroethylene, the mean unsigned percentage error for saturated
liquid densities and vapor pressures is less than 1 and 10%. In the
case with cis-1-2-dichloroethylene, the saturated
liquid densities are slightly over predicted (approximately 1.5% error)
specifically at lower temperatures, and thus saturated vapor pressures
are underpredicted. Overall, the mean unsigned percentage error for
saturated liquid densities of cis-1-2-dichloroethylene
is less than 1.1%. The dipole moment of cis-1-2-dichloroethylene
in the gas phase and in the implicit solvent is quite high as compared
with 1,1-dichloroethylene. Because of this, the dipole–dipole
and dispersion interactions are expected to play a dominant role for
this compound, whereas van der Waals dispersion forces are expected
to govern thermophysical properties for trans-1-2-dichloroethylene
compound. There is a reasonably good agreement for the predicted VLE
properties of all of the three dichloroethylene isomers. The numerical
data for the saturated liquid and vapor densities and saturated vapor
pressures and heat of vaporization obtained from GEMC simulations
for all compounds is provided in the Supporting Information. Overall, ρliq, ρvap, pvap, and ΔHvap obtained from GEMC simulations for all chloroethene
compounds are in excellent agreement with the experimental data.52−56

the nonavailability of critical density.

For all compounds, the predicted critical temperature (TC) and normal boiling point (TB) are listed in Table 5. Table 5 is divided into two sections based on the molecules included in
the parameterization process and molecules included in the validation
set to test the molecule transferability. The critical properties
and normal boiling point for all compounds are in excellent agreement
with the experimental data.52−56 For all compounds considered in the present work, there average
error in TC and TB is approximately 1%.

4.2 VLE Phase Diagram for Binary Mixtures
The binary mixture of trichloroethylene and 1-propanol forms a nonideal
mixtures leading to the formation of a minimum boiling point azeotrope.
The temperature–composition diagram of the binary mixtures
of trichloroethylene/1-propanol at different pressures (20 and 100
kPa) are depicted in Figure 3A,B. The new force field reproduces the shape of the experimental Txy diagram reasonably well.57 However, the TCE mole fraction is somewhat underpredicted.
Moreover, the boiling points for trichloroethylene and 1-propanol
are also underpredicted by 1–2 K at both pressures. Generally,
the location of azeotrope is of particular interest, and it is often
difficult to accurately predict the location with simulations. Specifically
for 100 kPa, the compositions obtained from the simulations around
azeotrope provide a good match when compared with the experimental
data. Overall, both binary phase diagrams at different pressures demonstrate
that the force field parameters for chloroethenes with alcohol compounds
provide a satisfactory treatment of the interaction potential. In
order to further test the accuracy of the proposed force field, the Txy phase diagram is predicted
for the binary mixture of trichloroethylene and DMSO at 95.3 kPa,
which is shown in Figure 3C. Particularly, the compositions obtained from Monte Carlo
simulations in the vapor phase are in good agreement with the experimental
data. However, the liquid phase TCE mole fraction is somewhat underpredicted
especially at higher temperatures.

and 1-propanol at 20 (A)

4.3 Microscopic Structure of TCE/1-Propanol Mixtures
Isothermal–isobaric simulations were used to investigate
the cluster size distributions for 1-propanol in trichloroethylene/1-propanol
mixtures at different state points of the binary VLE. The state points
located at the left and right of the azeotrope were chosen to investigate
the cluster size distributions due to hydrogen bonding. Figure 4 shows the population of propanol
aggregate distributions at 20 and 100 kPa. Hydrogen bonds were identified
using the following criteria: rOO ≤
3.3 Å, rOH ≤ 2.5 Å, and
cos θOH–OL ≤ −0.1, where rOO, rOH, and cos θOH–OL are the oxygen–oxygen
distance, oxygen–hydrogen distance, the angle between the OH
bond vector on the donating molecule and the oxygen lone pair vector
on the accepting molecule, respectively.23,59 At the left of the azeotrope, the figure shows the larger number
of clusters having 2–6 molecules at both pressures. Moreover,
it also shows a smaller fraction of a cluster having larger aggregates
containing 7–12 molecules. However, when considering the composition
to the right of the azeotrope, we observe smaller clusters (1–5
molecules) at both pressures. In other words, the transition from
larger aggregates (more than 7–12 molecules) to the smaller
aggregates was observed when moving from left of the azeotrope to
the right.

Figure 4 Population of 1-propanol aggregates at 20 and 100 kPa. Red circles
and black diamonds represent data left (T = 313.95
K, x1-propanol = 0.68) and right
(T = 310.35 K, x1-propanol = 0.04) of the azeotrope compositions, respectively, at 20 kPa.
Similarly, green circles and indigo diamonds represent data at the
left (T = 354.15 K, x1-propanol = 0.62) and right (T = 354.15 K, x1-propanol = 0.06) of the azeotrope, respectively,
at 100 kPa.

Additional information
regarding the first and second solvation
shells can be obtained from the RDFs of trichloroethylene/1-propanol
mixtures at different state points. For this purpose, the state points
and corresponding compositions obtained at the left and right of the
azeotrope were chosen to determine the oxygen–oxygen (OO) and
oxygen–hydrogen (OH) RDF distributions. Figure 5A,B show the oxygen–oxygen (OO) and
oxygen–hydrogen (OH) liquid phase RDFs for 1-propanol and corresponding
number integrals (NIs) at 20 and 100 kPa, respectively. For both pressures,
the most noticeable is the large enhancements for the heights of first
peaks for the OO and OH RDFs. The heights of the first peak for the
OO and OH RDFs appears near 2.71 and 1.78 Å for both pressures
considered, and the second peak is located near 3.15 Å for OH
RDF. Considering 20 kPa RDF plot, there is a large increase in the
height of the peak for OO and OH RDFs as compared to 100 kPa RDF analysis.
These large peaks clearly indicate the presence of hydrogen bonding
for all compositions and temperatures. The peak heights are significantly
large on the right side of the azeotrope location primarily because
of the lower mole fraction of propanol in the liquid phase. The first
peak in the OO RDF yields coordination numbers of 2.42 (x1-propanol = 0.68) and 1.79 (x1-propanol = 0.04), and the coordination number
from OH RDF are 0.99 (x1-propanol = 0.68) and 0.73 (x1-propanol = 0.04) for 20 kPa. The first peak in the OO RDF yields coordination
numbers of 2.25 (x1-propanol =
0.62) and 1.32 (x1-propanol = 0.06),
and the coordination number from OH RDF are 0.91 (x1-propanol = 0.62) and 0.56 (x1-propanol = 0.06) for 100 kPa.

and right (T = 354.15 K, x1-propanol = 0.06) of the azeotrope, respectively, for 100 kPa. Similarly,

4.4 Microscopic
Structure of Neat Liquids
Figure 6A–D
shows RDFs for carbon–carbon (C–C), carbon–chlorine
(C–Cl), chlorine (Cl)–chlorine (Cl), and center of mass
separations for tetrachloroethylene molecule at 293 K. All of the
RDF plots were compared with the results obtained from molecular dynamics
simulations carried out in Gereben and Pusztai work.15 In Gereben and Pusztai work,15 LJ parameters are taken from OPLS-AA17 and used in combination with two different sets of partial atomic
charges (ED_MID and ED_Cl). In the C–C and C–Cl plots,
the location of the first coordination shell peak is at 6 and 4.95
Å, respectively, which is in good agreement with ED_MID and ED_Cl
simulation data. All RDF analyses from our force field simulations
are in good agreement with Gereben and Pusztai work.15 However, the Gereben and Pusztai15 included intramolecular Cl–Cl terms in their plot along with
intermolecular terms (Figure 6C). This leads to two sharp peaks at short distances and distorts
the intermolecular RDF. The long-range behavior is in good agreement
with our force field. Figure 6D results are in excellent agreement with the ED_MID center
of mass RDF plot. As depicted by Gereben and Pusztai work,15 a shoulder is observed between 3.9 and 4.1 Å
for the ED_MID charge sets and our simulation results also confirm
this noteworthy feature at 3.95 Å, as shown in Figure 6D. In addition, the location
of the first coordination shell peak is at 6.35 Å approximately
as compared to 6.3 Å in their work.

phase of tetrachloroethylene at 293 K.
(A–D) Carbon–carbon, carbon–chlorine, chlorine–chlorine,
and center of mass RDFs, respectively. The blue and green color lines
represent results obtained from ED_Cl and ED_MID MD simulations in
the work by Gereben and Pusztai.15 Red
color lines represent results obtained from the force field developed
in the present work.

Furthermore, another essential structural detail concerning
positioning
of the molecules can be gleaned from ARDF. Because ARDF resolves the
angle in addition to the radial distance (as in RDFs), they can provide
information about relative orientation of the molecules in the liquid
phase. Figure 7 shows
ARDF for chloroethylene, trichloroethylene, and tetrachloroethylene
at 255, 288, and 293 K, respectively. For ARDF, the distance is based
on the center of mass of the molecule. In the case of chloroethylene,
and trichloroethylene, the angles were defined based on the vectors
that closely align with the dipole moment vector of molecules. For
chloroethylene, the angle is calculated between vectors from chlorine
(Cl6) to carbon atom (C1) (see Figure 1). Similarly, for trichloroethylene, the angle is calculated
between vectors from chlorine (Cl6) to carbon atom (C2) (see Figure 1). With no dipole
moment for tetrachloroethylene, the long axis was defined by the vectors
pointing from first carbon atom to the second carbon atom.

Figure 7A for chloroethylene
molecule shows a strong inclination for antiparallel orientation in
the first solvation shell. The ARDF plot for chloroethylene shows
a considerably higher peak near r ≈ 4.1–4.3
Å and 180°, which shows the preference for antiparallel
orientation. For the trichloroethylene liquid phase, there are a few
dominating peaks near parallel and antiparallel orientations, which
basically covers a wide range of angle domain between 5.7 < r < 6.1 Å. The chloroethylene and trichloroethylene
molecule prefers to align with an angle that maximizes the interaction
between chlorine and hydrogen atoms and that seems to get enhanced
in the antiparallel orientation. Because of the symmetry of the tetrachloroethylene
molecule, it prefers to be in parallel or antiparallel orientation,
as shown in Figure 7C. The peaks are mostly located between 4.9 < r < 5.3 Å.

(A), trichloroethylene
(B), and tetrachloroethylene (C).

Figure 8 shows SDF for the liquid phase of chloroethylene,
trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene at 255, 288, and 293 K,
respectively. The surfaces shown in the figure corresponds to the
25% most likely positions of molecules in the first solvation shell.
The center for each molecule was defined between the midpoints of
the carbon–carbon bond. Figure 8A,B,C shows higher density distribution around a particular
molecule within the first solvation shell. Because of the symmetry
of tetrachloroethylene molecule, the density distribution analysis
reflects the same symmetry where molecules in the first solvation
shell occupy the region in between chlorine atoms. In the case with
chloroethylene and trichloroethylene, the density distribution is
focused largely on the single chlorine and hydrogen atom in the particular
molecule. This is predominantly due to the stronger interaction between
chlorine and hydrogen atoms.

(A), trichloroethylene
(B), and tetrachloroethylene (C). The 25% most likely positions around
the particular molecule are shown.

5 Conclusions
In this work, we have presented
a transferable force field for
chloroethenes, which can accurately predict the VLCCs, saturated vapor
pressure, critical properties, boiling temperatures, and structural
properties (RDFs, ARDF, SDF). The nonbonded interaction parameters
for molecules depend mainly on the bonding environment. Considering
the bonding environment of the carbon atom, different epsilon and
sigma parameters were parameterized for (C)HxCly. The force field
shows satisfactory agreement with the experimental data for neat component
properties and yields a suitable agreement for critical properties
and boiling points for all compounds considered. Moreover, the force
field predicts binary phase diagram of trichloroethylene/1-propanol
and trichloroethylene/DMSO at different pressures fairly well. Near
azeotrope or far from azeotrope, the force field is able to nicely
predict the shape of the experimental curve. The structural analysis
of 1-propanol in the binary mixture of trichloroethylene/1-propanol
was also performed, where there is a significant increase in smaller
clusters formation while going from left to the right of the azeotrope
composition. The RDFs for binary mixtures demonstrate extensive hydrogen
bonding between 1-propanol molecules at 20 and 100 kPa pressures.
In addition, the RDFs for pure chloroethene compounds were obtained
and compared with the available literature data. The ARDF and SDP
analyses provide the detailed microscopic view of the first coordination
shell where parallel and antiparallel configurations are preferred.
Furthermore, the present work extends the applicability of popular
TraPPE force field to chloroethenes that are major environmental contaminants.
