1 Introduction
The
imbalance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in living systems
has been connected to potentially detrimental oxidation of biomolecules
that can lead to accelerated cell death.1 However, if properly managed the generation of ROS can be incorporated
into environmental remediation or therapeutic strategies. Thus, materials
and conditions that govern the production of ROS are of interest to
a number of research communities addressing biomedical or sustainability
challenges. Published work with different nanostructured materials
has established that many of their specific characteristics can be
linked to variable productions of ROS.2 Size and composition of these types of materials have been initially
explored. Size of the nanostructures can lead to variable cell uptake
and in turn to different productions of ROS.3 Shape has also emerged as an additional parameter to consider in
explaining variations in ROS levels.4,5 For instance,
in the case of gold, hexagonal particles produce more ROS compared
to spherical and triangular ones during in vitro experiments with
epithelial cells, but dose, mass, and volume also greatly impacted
particle cell internalization.6 In vitro
work with carbon materials demonstrated lower ROS levels when spherical
shapes were utilized and directly compared to elongated shapes.7 In contrast, nanoceria (CeO2) evaluated
in the presence of macrophages produced no ROS regardless of the shape
of the material used.8 However, other oxide
materials, such as iron oxide, do produce variable ROS levels when
rod-shaped versus sphere-shaped ones are placed in the presence of
macrophages.9 Rod versus spherical nanosized
ZnO have also been studied in cancer cell lines and have generated
variable ROS species.10 The results have
been rationalized based on the different stabilities and release of
metal ions from each shape.

The production of ROS can be enhanced
not only by the presence
of specific materials but also by simultaneous exposure to certain
environmental conditions, such as radiation. In such situations, the
maximum effect can be achieved through the use of a scintillator material.
A scintillator is any material that can glow when it is exposed to
high-energy particles or photons.11 X-rays
are used to stimulate a scintillator to emit light. The scintillator
material is sometimes described as an X-ray transducer that facilitates
the generation of 1O2 through an energy-transfer
process. A number of medical imaging techniques rely on scintillators,
and advancements in recent years have been largely due to materials
discovery as well as instrumentation improvements.12 From a materials prospective, the utility of scintillators
is based on the fact that they enable the conversion of X-rays to
UV/visible photons within 1 ps. The structure, size, and composition
of scintillators can enhance the desired strong luminescence emission.13 Radiation sensitization or radiosensitization
refers to a collection of strategies to enhance the effect of radiation
exposure.14 With respect to biomaterials
design that entails the generation of more secondary electrons and
increased production of ROS that lead to improved radiation efficacy.15 Quantification of the production of ROS after
X-ray exposure is one way to benchmark radiosensitization.16 Many material systems have been studied to assess
their ability to act as radiosensitizers. Promising results with a
number of high Z-materials have been published, and their references
are too numerous to list. However, studies traditionally do not compare
architectural configurations with different sizes, shapes, and compositions.
Designing a biomaterials system that enables such comparisons will
facilitate the identification of the most suitable candidates for
enhanced radiosensitization that can be further tested in clinically
relevant models.

In this paper, we examine the role of shape
in composites with
gallium oxyhydroxide (GaOOH) particles and Matrigel. The current work
builds on prior promising results that demonstrated that the presence
of a scintillator material inside a scaffold triggered different cellular
responses when radiation was used.17,18 These studies
performed by Berg et al. have demonstrated the behavior of GaOOH nanoparticles
in cell free environments of both water and cell growth media. We
now study the effect of GaOOH particle anisotropy in a composite.
The particles are embedded into the gel to understand only the materials
effect on the generation of ROS rather than cell penetrating variations, Scheme 1. Gallium containing
nanostructures were chosen for their favorable scintillating properties,
documented therapeutic potential of Ga,19 and recent renewed interest to improve cellular uptake and anticancer
activity of Ga-coordinating complexes.20 The inspiration for the design of this current study is based on
key prior observations.17,18 We observed that in
Ga-containing composites the ROS production is chemical stemming due
to the presence of the GaOOH. Therefore, we wanted to test if different
shapes of particles with variable stabilities will produce different
ROS amounts. In addition, the design depicted in Scheme 1 is intended to test if the
presence of the any amount of GaOOH can enhance the production of
ROS species after variable radiation conditions. We note that in prior
work we have also assessed the Ga toxicity using an extremely water-soluble
salt: Ga(NO3)3.18 Previously, we recorded no concentration dependence on toxicity.
In this work, we test the effects of the collective behavior hypothesized
to contribute to the production of more ROS and result in an enhanced
radiosensitization. The GaOOH particles are characterized by scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). We evaluate
the stability of GaOOH in solution by recording the amount of metal
leached using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).
The amount of ROS in each construct under variable radiation conditions
is quantified in the presence and absence of cells seeded on top of
the composites. The viability of cells is also recorded under different
in vitro conditions. The collective materials characterization and
the results from the bioassays are used to explain the role of anisotropy
on the radiosensitization of nanostructures containing Ga.

GaOOH Particles on PC12 Cell Viability and ROS Production
2 Results
and Discussion
We focus on understanding of how to enhance
the radiosensitization
effect during the fabrication of the composite rather than exploring
ideas to increase the effect via better uptake of particles into cells.
We prepared three composites with different arrangements, shown in Scheme 1, to test the following
hypotheses: (1) composition and amount of Z-material in the composite
determine the magnitude of the radiosensitization; (2) anisotropy
of the nanostructured material in the composite has an effect on the
generation of ROS; (3) material composition and anisotropy can be
used to generate additive or cooperative effects. We synthesized two
different shapes of GaOOH and also used commercially available gallium
salt, Ga(NO3)3 that is highly soluble in water.
We chose these Ga-containing materials because even small quantities
of Ga can have noticeable impact. It is known that gallium ions can
bind to transferrin receptors and be taken specifically and nonspecifically
into cells.19 This can result in severe
disturbance of iron homeostasis and have adverse effects.21 The amount and shape of the Ga-based material
are controlled during the composite manufacturing. The composite fabrication
requires no specialized equipment and only easy processing that relies
on different Ga mass quantities to vary the properties of the composite.
PC12 cells were used to study the production of ROS before and after
radiation. During all testing, the cells were seeded on top of the
GaOOH/Matrigel composites to avoid endocytosis of GaOOH-nanostructured
material. No visible particles were identified on the top of the interface.
In the experimental setup, we also performed experiments in the absence
of cells. This setup permitted us to understand the ROS changes induced
by the Ga-based materials in the composite after radiation rather
than changes as a result of transformations due to dynamic biological
processes driven by the cells.

A number of research groups have
published reports on how to synthesize
GaOOH via solvothermal procedures.22−24 We choose to utilize
the microwave synthesis method because: the synthesis can be finished
in less than an hour; the starting material, GaNO3, is
commercially available and affordable for a large-scale synthesis;
the size and shape of the nanostructured product can be varied by
tuning the reaction conditions; and the resulting particles do not
require any stabilizing ligands. In a typical synthesis run, we dissolved
GaNO3 in water to create a 0.1 M solution. We increased
the pH to 8 by slowing the addition of NaOH. That solution is then
loaded into a glass vessel and placed into a microwave synthesis system
and heated to 120 °C for 20 min. The product that forms is fluffy
and white in color. This product is washed with water and vacuum-dried
with no heat. During the entire procedure, no organic ligands are
used to control the size and shape of the particles. One can change
the shape by simply omitting the use of heat to allow the formation
of GaOOH. The quality of the particles was assessed with a number
of characterization techniques. Thorough examination of particle shape
and morphology was performed with SEM analysis and representative
images are shown in Figure 1. The SEM characterization was performed to assess size and
shape and not to assess aggregation behavior. We termed one shape
of particles as orzo due to its specific elongated geometry with the
appearance of stacked (lenticular) plates that comprise the overall
ovoid shape. The other shape is referred to as anisotropic and was
observed to be granular with random nanoscale features on each side
of its blocky, subangular structure. XRD was used to track the transformation
of GaNO3 (an amorphous material) to crystalline GaOOH by
looking at the shape (broad for amorphous and sharp for crystalline)
of the peaks in the spectrum, Figure 2. Use of Scherrer’s equation provides a way
to compare the two types of particles synthesized. Because peak width
is inversely proportional to crystalline size, we analyzed the data
collected for both shapes and the peak at the (110) direction. Calculations
done using Scherrer’s equation and the peak at the (110) direction
showed that the crystalline grains for the orzo shape are ∼49
nm and for the anisotropic one to be ∼53 nm. In addition, we
confirmed that the diffraction patterns on Figure 1 can be assigned to the orthorhombic GaOOH
structure and are in agreement with literature reports.25

Nanostructured-Matrigel composites
for all testing of the stated
hypothesis were prepared by mixing either the GaOOH particles or the
Ga(NO3)3 salt with Matrigel and cell medium.
All of the compositions were placed in standard 96-well plates. The
compositions contained the following concentrations of Ga-based material:
0.02, 0.04, and 0.08 mg/μL (See Supporting Information for plate design for each bioassay). Each plate
was irradiated using a 6 MV photon beam from a clinical linear accelerator
(Novalis TX; Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA). Prior to the
irradiation experiments, the plate was surrounded by at least 1 cm
of solid, homogeneous, tissue-equivalent bolus material (density of
1.03 g/cm3). The setup is essential to achieve buildup
of lateral electronic equilibrium. Prior to every experiment, each
plate was placed at least 2 cm from the edge of the radiation field
to minimize penumbra effects. In addition, we covered the cell culture
dishes with 8.9 cm solid water phantom material, which was necessary
to guarantee the maximal field flatness. The output rate was set to
200 MU min–1 (SAD = 100 cm, d =
10 cm, A = 15 × 15 cm2). The samples
inside the cell culture dishes received total doses of 2, 4, or 10
Gy in a single fraction.

We chose to utilize the PC12 cell line
due to the ease of handling
and the abundance of studies published in the literature utilizing
the same in vitro protocols.26 The procedure
for the growth of PC12 cells utilized Dulbecco’s modified Eagle
medium (DMEM) high glucose formulation with 12.5% horse serum, 2.5%
fetal bovine serum, and 1% penicillin–streptomycin. The conditions
for the incubation were 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified
incubator and were maintained throughout all experiments. The parameters
for each trial were 7.5 × 104 cell/mL density and
0.5 mL per 100 mm plate. We allowed the PC12 cells to adhere for 18
h prior to beginning each trial. Control experiments were performed
on gels with no Ga material. We assessed cell survival (Alamar Blue
assay) and ROS generation (2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin
diacetate (DCFH-DA) assay). Figures 3 and 4 summarize the results
from the cell assays. Due to the number of parameters and comparisons,
all statistical analyses are reported in the Supporting Information. Here, we present a summary of the statistically
significant interactions that were observed along with key conclusions
we made based on the recorded results and subsequent statistical assessment.

after the indicated times in days, exposure to different amounts of
radiation and in the presence of the specified concentrations of (a)
nitrate salt; (b) anisotropic GaOOH; and (c) orzo GaOOH.

In experiments performed on Matrigel with no Ga-containing
materials,
we observed a small decrease in cell viability with time when the
PC12 cells were not exposed to any radiation treatments. Some cell
death is expected as the amount of cells grows with the progress of
duration of the experiment, as seen in Figure 3a. When these samples were exposed to radiation,
increasing radiation exposure resulted in no significant changes in
cell survival as the days of the experiments progressed, Figure 3b. We observed very
different results in viability when the three types of Ga-containing
materials were added to the composite, Figure 4. The Ga-salt yielded statistically significant
decrease in viability as both the concentration and the radiation
dose increased. In the case of the orzo particles, the viability of
PC12 cells changed only at higher concentrations, and the amount of
radiation did not influence the cell survival significantly. In contrast,
the anisotropic particles contributed to a decrease in cell viability
based on increasing concentration and a smaller decrease based on
higher doses of radiation treatment. Literature reports have established
that the levels of tolerance for Ga ions in different living systems
are yet to be established, but evidence points to the conclusion that
the lethal toxicity of Ga3+ is significantly lower than
other metal ions.27 Our viability results
support this conclusion because we observed significant changes only
at increased concentrations. The radiation exposure decreased the
viability of the PC12 when a significant amount of Ga was present
in the system supporting the notion that this metal can have a radiosensitizing
effect.

We quantified the amount of ROS under different radiation
conditions
in the presence and absence of cells, Figure 5. The presence of ROS causes breaks in the
DNA structure and leads to cell apoptosis and is used as a measure
of radiosensitization. The fluorescence at different time points (days)
was recorded. The DCFH-DA was dissolved in DMEM at a concentration
of 60 μM. For each measurement, the cell media was aspirated
off and 1 mL of the DCFH-DA solution was added. An incubation time
of 30 min was used prior to the fluorescence measurements with a Tecan
GENios microplate reader. The excitation filter and emission filters
were at 485 and 535 nm, respectively. The use of DCFH-DA in cell free
experiments has been the subject of other published work that showed
that with proper control experiments one can utilize the results obtained
by this assay to understand factors that influence the generation
of ROS in solution.28,29 We first consider the data obtained
in the absence of cells, first row of plots on Figure 5. In the case of the gallium salt, we recorded
an increase in ROS production with an increase in concentration and
eventually saw a saturation effect at the highest concentration. When
the samples containing the gallium salt were exposed to radiation
at different doses, we only observed an initial significant change
in ROS production, and no change was observed as the days of the experiment
progressed. In the case of the orzo particles, we observed a decrease
in ROS production with higher concentrations and higher doses in radiation.
However, with the anisotropic particles higher concentrations and
higher doses in radiation yielded more production of ROS. Overall,
the results we recorded in the absence of cells support the notion
that the orzo particles are more stable in solution and release less
gallium ions that can cause the production of ROS. The data recorded
with the anisotropic shape gave trends similar to the ones collected
with the water-soluble Ga(NO3)3 supporting a
conclusion that this shape of GaOOH is highly unstable in aqueous
solutions, which can induce ROS production.

Figure 5 Summary of the ROS assays
performed with DCFH-DA after the indicated
times in days, exposure to different amounts of radiation and in the
presence of the specified concentrations of (a) nitrate salt; (b)
nitrate salt and PC12 cells seeded on top of the Ga-containing composite;
(c) anisotropic GaOOH; (d) anisotropic GaOOH and PC12 cells seeded
on top of the Ga-containing composite; (e) orzo GaOOH; and (f) orzo
GaOOH and PC12 cells seeded on top of the Ga-containing composite.

The ROS assay was performed in
the same manner after cells were
seeded on the same composites and exposed to the same radiation conditions,
second row of plots on Figure 5. We observed the same overall comparative trends in ROS production,
as we did when there were no cells present, though the amount of ROS
measured was different compared to the data when no cells were present.
The results from both bioassays suggest that the availability of Ga
ions in solution is the main reason for the observed changes after
radiation exposure with respect to cell viability as well as ROS production.
We tested the stability of the two types of GaOOH by incubating them
in cell media, filtering the particles out, and measuring the amount
of Ga leached by ICP-MS. All of the data along with standard deviations
are plotted and presented in the Supporting Information. Table 1 shows a
comparison between the two trends of behavior we recorded. We observed
that the anisotropic particles continued to release Ga in solution,
as the days of the experiment progressed. In contrast, the amount
of Ga released from the orzo particles drastically decreases, as the
material was incubated in solution for 3 days. The data in Table 1 support the notion
that placement of the orzo particles in solution for longer periods
of time leads to passivation of their surface. Taken in sum the data
collected by ICP-MS supports the conclusions from the ROS and viability
assays and confirm that two types of particles have different stabilities
in solution. Thus, the overall trends in ROS production based on concentration
and radiation conditions were governed by particle stability. Leached
amount of Ga coupled with radiation dose can be used to generate different
amounts of ROS during in vitro experiments.

of Differences in the Amount
of Ga Leached Compared to the Initial Value on Day 0 Immediately after
Placing the Particles in Solution
GaOOH type	day 1 (%)	day 3 (%)	
orzo	–24 ± 0.5	–52 ± 2.2	
anisotropic	+149 ± 26.2	+454 ± 14.8	
3 Conclusions
In summary,
we demonstrate that the presence of Ga ions in composites
can have a radiosensitizing effect during in vitro experiments with
PC12 cells. We confirmed our hypothesis that the amount of the available
Ga3+ determines the magnitude of the radiosensitization.
With respect to shape of the GaOOH particles, one observes changes
in the generation of ROS, which are related to the stability of the
specific shape in aqueous solutions. Further, our results support
the notion that concentration and shape of Ga-containing materials
can be combined to generate an additive effect by increasing the amount
of available free metal ions in solution. The metal ions contribute
to the greatest generation of ROS after exposure to ionizing radiation.
The studies with GaOOH containing composites enable one to explore
the role of key parameters that lead to an increased efficiency of
radiation treatments. The reported results are currently being considered
in our laboratories for further translational biomaterials approaches.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
The
gallium nitrate hydrate
(289892) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Phenol red free Matrigel
(354262) and sodium hydroxide (UN1823) were obtained from Fisher Scientific.
The Alamar Blue assay (DAL 1025) was supplied by ThermoFisher Scientific.
The ROS assay uses 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate
(DCFH-DA) and was utilized as received from Sigma-Aldrich.

4.2 Ga Particle Fabrication
The orzo
GaOOH nanoparticles were synthesized via a microwave reaction based
on an experimental procedure reported by Pearce et al.30 The anisotropic GaOOH nanoparticles were synthesized
by precipitating GaOOH from solution with no additional microwave
or thermal treatment.

4.3 Composite Preparation
The Matrigel
composite was prepared by following the thin-gel protocol provided
by Corning and diluting to a protein concentration of 3 mg/mL. The
gallium bearing material was mixed with Matrigel just after pipetting
into cell culture plates to ensure homogeneity before gelation.

4.4 SEM Characterization

was performed with a Rigaku SmartLab X-ray diffractometer. Powder
diffraction was done with a Cu Kα X-ray source at 40 kV and
40 mA with Bragg–Brentano optical setup.

4.6 Cell Culture and Bioassays
Culturing
of PC12 cells was done using a sterile technique and a protocol described
in prior work.31 Cells were kept in an
incubator at 37 °C, and the cell media was replenished every
48 h. The bioassays were carried out using the manufacturer’s
protocol, and details for each one have been reported elsewhere.32

4.7 ICP-MS
The samples
incubated in the
two shapes of GaOOH was filtered and analyzed for gallium amount with
a Perkin Elmer Sciex Elan DRCII ICP-MS. Prior to any data collection,
a calibration was done with gallium 69. The solutions were also diluted
before the analysis, and the dilutions are factored in the final values
of the leached Ga.
