Protein
aggregation has caused limitations in the study and development
of protein-based biopharmaceuticals. We prepared different polysulfobetaine
(poly-SPB) polymers via reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer
(RAFT) polymerization. These polymers exhibited high efficiency in
modulation of protein aggregation. We synthesized polysulfobetaines
using two different RAFT agents, and analyzed the aggregation profile
of lysozyme and insulin. In poly-SPBs, existence of a hydrophobic
RAFT agent resulted in visible enhancement of the residual enzymatic
activity of lysozyme, whereas it remained unaffected by the hydrophilic
RAFT agent. In addition, these polymers resulted in significant suppression
in the aggregation of insulin. Increase in the molecular weight of
the polymer caused higher efficiency to perpetuate enzymatic activity
of lysozyme upon thermal denaturation. The polymers arrested the formation
of amyloid like fibrils of lysozyme and insulin, thus indicating their
potential to inhibit aggregation. The results unambiguously demonstrate
the importance of polysulfobetaine moiety and hydrophobicity in protein
aggregation inhibition. This study gives insight into the protein
aggregation inhibition by zwitterionic polymers, which have a potential
to be developed as aggregation inhibitors in the future.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Polysulfobetaines
(poly-SPBs) are zwitterionic polymers that have
a cationic quaternary ammonium ion and an anionic sulfonate ion on
the same monomer unit. Due to anti-polyelectrolytic effect, polysulfobetaines
have been used in industrial applications, as they form open coiled
chain structures in solution. The biocompatible properties of polysulfobetaines
have been studied recently whose resemblance to phospholipids is responsible
for such a behavior.1−6 Sulfobetaine polymers show good hemocompatibility,7 have antifouling properties,8 suppress nonspecific binding of proteins and do not modify the structure
of the hydrogen-bonded network of water molecules at the interface
of the polymer and material.9,10 They have been used
for various applications including wound dressing8 and cryopreservation,11 as well
as in separation science12 and drug delivery.13,14

Protein aggregation is a biological phenomenon in which misfolded
proteins cluster together intra- or extracellularly to form an aggregated
mass of fibers with the β-sheet conformation called amyloids,15 which ensue neurodegenerative diseases like
Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Huntington’s, amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis, etc.16,17 Protein aggregation
due to physical clumping involves changes in protein primary structure,
and chemical aggregation involves changes in chemical structure, e.g.,
covalent bond formation.18 Depending on
the type of aggregation taking place, the aggregates may be soluble
or insoluble.19 Earlier, various compounds
like arginine,20 proline,21 cyclodextrin,22 and many other
compounds18 have been used to inhibit protein
unfolding and aggregation. The success rates are not very high, so
there is a scope and great need to develop new protein aggregation
inhibitors. Certain amphiphilic proteins23 and sulfobetaines with nondetergent properties24 have shown protein aggregation inhibitor properties in
solution by assisting in protein folding.

One of the common
proteins used to study protein aggregation is
hen egg-white lysozyme (HEWL) because of its easy availability and
readily available information about its complete primary and higher-order
structures.25,26 Also, its folding and unfolding
mechanisms have been studied in detail, and the unfolding intermediates
have been identified.27−30 Lysozyme is a small enzyme that acts as an antimicrobial protein
by cleaving the cell walls of bacteria.31 Lysozyme readily undergoes a thermally induced aggregation and forms
amyloid-like fibrils.32,33 The structure of the HEWL is
similar to that of the human lysozyme, and certain mutations in this
protein have been reported to induce an amyloid disease.34,35 In addition, we used insulin protein, which regulates the sugar
level in body and is secreted in the form of hormone from pancreas.
Insulin is widely popular in the treatment of diabetes, which has
affected millions of lives globally. It is commonly available in the
form of injections and pumps where the aggregation of insulin decreases
it activity over the time. Hence, it is a challenge to administer
the protein in the treatment of diabetes that arouse the need for
modulators.

In our previous study, we showed that polysulfobetaine
polymers
can act as protein aggregation inhibitors against HEWL and insulin.36−38 However, the structure–activity relationship, i.e., the importance
of various polymer parameters such as hydrophobicity and molecular
structure on the efficiency of inhibition had not been elucidated.
Therefore, in this report, we have synthesized a library of poly-SPB
polymers with different molecular weights, end groups, and functionality
via reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization
and then examined the aggregation inhibition of the hen egg lysozyme
and bovine insulin. This was accomplished by measuring the residual
enzymatic activity of lysozyme and aggregation profile of lysozyme
and insulin in the poly-SPB solution by employing Thioflavin T (ThT)
assay.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization
Polysulfobetaine
polymers with different RAFT agents and degrees of polymerization
(DP) were synthesized from the monomer 3-((3-acrylamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio)-propane-1-sulfonate
by RAFT polymerization (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Poly-SPB with Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic
RAFT Agent
The polymers were
characterized using 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Figures S1–S8). Polymer formation was analyzed by 1H NMR by observing
the loss of vinyl protons during the course
of polymerization. Figure 1a,b clearly demonstrates that 2-(dodecylthiocarbonothioylthio)-2-methylpropionic
acid (R1) and 3-((((1-carboxyethyl)thio)carbonothioyl)thio)propanoic
acid (R2) polymers with different molecular weights were obtained,
indicated by the differences in the intensity of signals of the RAFT
agent in polymers with different degrees of polymerization (DP). Since
the relative amount of the RAFT agent end group in the polymer with
DP 20 is higher than that in the polymer with DP 200, clear signals
of the RAFT agent with higher intensity were obtained. Polymers with
different levels of RAFT agents were also successfully synthesized
(Figure 1c). The average
molecular weights and polydispersity index (PDI) values of poly-SPB
polymers were determined using gel permeation chromatography (GPC).
Owing to the use of RAFT polymerization, the PDI was determined to
be between 1.1 and 1.5, and the average molecular weights were similar
to the theoretical values. A summary of the characteristics of all
of the polymers synthesized is provided in Table 1. Poly-SPB of DP 20 and 200 with R1 will
be denoted as R1-20 and R1-200, respectively. Similarly, with R2,
polymers are indicated as R2-20 and R2-200.

RAFT agent (R1), (b) with DP 20 and DP 200 using hydrophilic RAFT
agent (R2), and (c) R2 and R1 with DP 20 in D2O. Mn can be calculated from the NMR data, Mn = nM0 + Me where n is DP (no. of repeating
units), M0 is the molecular weight of
one monomer (repeating unit), and Me is
the molecular weight of the end-groups attached to the polymer.

2.2 Residual
Enzymatic Activity
The protein
aggregation inhibition property of polysulfobetaines was studied using
an enzymatic assay of HEWL involving Micrococcus lysodeikticus. Lysozyme is an enzyme that can break down the cell walls of various
bacteria by hydrolyzing them. Lysozyme clears the turbidity of the
bacterial suspension, as it destroys the bacterial cell walls making
bactericidal studies possible. The disappearance of turbidity in the
poly-SPB solution with the addition of lysozyme was measured using
spectrophotometric analysis where the absorbance was measured with
time. The residual lysozyme activity of the solution at different
concentrations was calculated from slope of the graph plotted between
absorbance and time. The term residual lysozyme activity here refers
to the remaining ability of the lysozyme to perform lysis of bacterial
cells after it has been heated to 90 °C. Arginine hydrochloride
was used as the control to assess the activity of polysulfobetaines
(Figure S9). In addition, the stability
of the dodecyl group of the RAFT agent was analyzed using mass spectrometry
(MALDI) (Figure S10).

Residual activity
of lysozyme was calculated both in the presence and in the absence
of poly-SPBs to examine their capacity to prevent the thermal aggregation
of lysozyme. Figure 2a,b unambiguously demonstrate that a polymer synthesized with a hydrophobic
RAFT agent (R1) shows better propensity to stabilize proteins during
heating. The residual enzymatic activity obtained with R1 was markedly
higher than that obtained with R2. A previous study had indicated
that hydrophobic species are capable of masking the hydrophobic surfaces
of proteins,40 which, in turn, could prevent
the aggregation-inducing collisions between the hydrophobic domains
of the protein. Additionally, we can see that changing the RAFT agent
in case of the higher-molecular-weight polymer did not yield a significant
difference. This can be attributed to the relative amounts of RAFT
agent in polymers with DP 20 and DP 200. In the case of R1-20 and
R2-20, since the polymer chain is short, the end group has a significant
effect on the overall properties of the polymer. Thus, the protein
molecules are unable to interact due to the hindrance from the hydrophobic
raft agent in the short-chain polymer. On the contrary, in R1-200
and R2-200, owing to the long polymer chain, the end group does not
have any significant effect on the polymer properties. Similar results
were obtained upon increasing the degree of polymerization, i.e.,
the molecular weight of the polymer. Increase in the DP from 20 to
200 resulted in an increase in residual enzymatic activity (Figure 2c,d), thus indicating
that polymers with longer chains enable greater protection for proteins
during extreme stress. Since the inhibition of protein aggregation
by poly-SPB is linked to their antibiofouling abilities, the increase
in inhibition efficiency is due to the greater antibiofouling ability.
As is well known, shorter polymer chains exhibit antibiofouling ability
due to their hydrophilicity owing to the formation of the hydration
layer. On the other hand, in polymer with longer chains, the effect
due to the formation of the hydration layer is supplemented by the
presence of steric repulsion (due to flexible polymer chains), which
enables them to have a greater antibiofouling ability.41,42

R1, and (d) different DPs with R2.

2.3 Aggregation Profile of Insulin
Aggregation
profile of insulin was studied in the polymer solution using spectrophotometric
analysis, where an increase in absorbance was measured with respect
to time. The analysis was carried out over 24 h, and absorbance was
noted at time intervals such as 0, 4, 7, 12, and 24 h where insulin
was incubated in polymer solution at 37 °C. Polymers were used
at three different concentrations (2, 4, and 6%); it is noticeable
that the concentration of the polymers to arrest the aggregation of
insulin was much lower than that needed for lysozyme. It can be attributed
to the fact that insulin is composed of 51 amino acids, which is less
than that number of amino acids in lysozyme. Initially, we have done
a simultaneous comparison of R1–R2 and DP 20–200. Figure 3a shows that in the
presence of R1-20, insulin aggregation was reduced significantly.
In addition, the decrease was linear with increase in concentration.
This is due to the presence of the hydrophobic RAFT agent (R1) integrated
with poly-SPB. Meanwhile, R2-200 did not show significant changes
in the aggregation of insulin at 2% (Figure 3b). However, with rise in polymer concentration
(4 and 6%), there was a decrease in the absorbance values, indicating
the arrest of insulin aggregation in the presence of high-molecular-weight
polymer with R2. Further, we discussed individual comparisons in the
activity of poly-SPBs by utilizing Thioflavin T (ThT) assay, which
is a widely acceptable method to study the aggregation of proteins.

analysis of insulin when incubated at 37 °C
in the presence of (a) R1-20 and (b) R2-200 at 2% (red squares), 4%
(green triangles), and 6% (yellow rhombus). Absorbance was measured
at 500 nm over 24 h. Absorbance values indicated the extent of aggregation
of insulin.

2.4 Thioflavin
T Assay
Proteins are known
to form amyloid fibrils as a result of aggregation. These fibrils
are reported to be responsible for a wide range of diseases such as
Alzheimer’s and prion diseases as well as several types of
systemic amyloidosis.43,44 Hence, suppression of the formation
of the fibrils is very important for the development of the next generation
of protein biopharmaceutics. Therefore, we used a ThT fluorescence
assay to analyze the effect of sulfobetaine polymers on lysozyme and
insulin fibrillation. ThT is a cationic benzothiazole salt that shows
specific binding to amyloid fibrils,45 which,
in turn, leads to enhanced fluorescence.46 Hence, a higher ThT fluorescence indicates an increased formation
of amyloid fibrils. ThT assay demonstrated that a poly-SPB formed
in the presence of a hydrophobic RAFT agent at DP 20 (R1-20) resulted
in the greater suppression of fibril formation of lysozyme than a
poly-SPB formed in the presence of R2 (R2-20), which is in accordance
with the observation of enzymatic activity assay. Far UV-circular
dichroism (CD) spectrum shows the preservation of the higher-order
structure of lysozyme in the presence of R1-20 upon incubation at
elevated temperature (Figure S12). In our
previous report, attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared
and NMR measurements exhibited that R1-20 prevents any changes in
the secondary structure of lysozyme.36 The
same trend was observed for the increase in the molecular weight of
the polymer, where a polymer with a longer chain length showed greater
efficiency in suppressing the formation of fibrils (Figure 4). This result clearly suggests
that polysulfobetaines have excellent efficiency in inhibiting the
formation of fibrils, and further changes in the polymer structure
and functionality could render it more effective in stabilizing proteins
under extreme stress.

Figure 4 Aggregation of lysozyme at the concentration of 0.5 mg/mL,
heated
to 90 °C for 30 min in the presence of poly-SPB with DP 20 and
200 of R1 and R2 at 5 and 10% polymer concentrations. Data are expressed
as the mean ± standard deviation (SD), where error bars are SD
of three independent experiments (five samples each).

In case of insulin, we analyzed insulin aggregation
in all four
polymers at 2, 4, and 6%. Figure 5a,b demonstrate the effect of the hydrophobic RAFT
agent (R1) and the hydrophilic RAFT agent (R2) at 2, 4, and 6% polymer
concentrations on the time-dependent aggregation profile of insulin.
As shown in these figures, an increase in the concentration leads
to significant increase in the inhibition property of these polymers.
R1-20 exhibits higher efficiency (as can be seen in Figure S11) to arrest the aggregation of insulin even at 2%,
whereas higher concentration of R2-20 was required to do the same.
Micellar form of polymer caused hindrance in the aggregation by shielding
the monomers/dimers of insulin. R1-20 also retains the higher-order
structure of insulin upon incubating the protein at physiological
temperature (Figure S13). Further, use
of higher-molecular-weight polymers, i.e., R1-200 and R2-200, showed
that R2-200 exhibits better inhibition than R1-200 (Figure 5c,d). These findings indicate
that the hydrophobic RAFT agent (R1) with smaller DP (20) contributes
significantly to arrest the aggregation of insulin (Figure 5e). In addition, activity was
in the order of R1-20 > R2-20 > R2-200 > R1-200. The activity
of R1-200
was lower than that of R2-200, since long chain of polymer tones down
the effect of R1 in protein inhibition. Thus, we can conclude that
R1-20 exhibits the best inhibitory effect in the aggregation of insulin.
This is in complete accordance with the spectrophotometric analysis.

of R1-20 and 2, 4, and 6%. Data are expressed as the mean ± SD

We propose a hypothetical model to explain the mechanism
behind
the activity of polymer, as presented as Figure 6. As polymers are zwitterionic in nature,
we postulate that it will serve as a molecular shield between two
protein molecules. The aggregation of protein will occur only if monomer
molecules of protein comes in contact, forms oligomeric, and then
fibrillary species. In addition, poly-SPBs may also act as molecular
chaperons; in general, chaperons are ubiquitous class of compounds
that are responsible for folding/refolding of the proteins. Recently,
we have demonstrated that poly-SPB in conjugation with butyl methacrylate
can cause the refolding of the fibrillary species of insulin protein.38

3 Conclusions
Through the study of the
protein aggregation inhibition abilities
of poly-SPBs with different chain lengths and RAFT agents, we were
able to notice the change in the inhibition patterns of these polymers.
The results unambiguously demonstrated that sulfobetaines have excellent
efficiency in inhibiting lysozyme and insulin aggregation, and that
a change in molecular weight and hydrophobicity of the polymers caused
a greater stabilization of lysozyme and insulin. These investigations
indicated the potential of these polymers to suppress the formation
of amyloid fibrils. This study will further our ability to discern
the myriad of properties associated with the protein aggregation inhibition
capacity of polysulfobetaines, the polymers that could serve as an
indispensable source to treat various problems associated with protein
aggregation. Although differences in the aggregation inhibition tendencies
of these polysulfobetaines have been examined and explained theoretically,
further studies are underway to find out more about dependence of
aggregation inhibition efficiencies of poly-SPBs on RAFT agents and
different functional groups.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials
Osaka Organic Chemical
(Osaka, Japan) donated sulfobetaine monomer that was used without
further purification. Insulin from bovine pancreas, lysozyme from
chicken egg white, M. lysodeikticus, and 2-(dodecylthiocarbonothioylthio)-2-methylpropionic acid (R1)
were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Japan). Azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN)
was obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan). 3-((((1-Carboxyethyl)thio)carbonothioyl)thio)propanoic
acid (R2) was purchased from Boron Molecular (North Carolina).

4.2 Synthesis of Poly-SPB
SPB polymer
with hydrophobic and hydrophilic RAFT agents and DP were prepared.
For instance, the methodology of polymer synthesis with DP 20 and
R1 as RAFT agent is stated as follows: SPB monomer (8 mmol), R1 (0.4
mmol), and AIBN (0.08 mmol) were dissolved in a mixture of water and
methanol (1:3), followed by purging with nitrogen gas for 1 h. Sealed
solution flasks were then placed and stirred in an oil bath at 70
°C for 24 h. The samples (20–30 μL) were removed
periodically, quenched in liquid nitrogen, and used for observing
the 1H NMR spectra (in D2O) to calculate the
conversion rate. For purification, the reaction mixture was dialyzed
against water for 3 days with water changed five times, and the dry
sample was obtained after lyophilization.

4.3 Nuclear
Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy
1H and 13C NMR spectra of the polymers were
recorded using D2O as the solvent using a 400 MHz Bruker
Avance III HD spectrometer installed with the Topspin 3.5 software,
which was used to process the spectra (Figures S1–S8).

4.4 Gel Permeation Chromatography
(GPC)
For the determination of molecular weight and polydispersity
index
(PDI) of the polymers, GPC (BioSeps2000 column; Phenomenex, Inc.,
CA) equipped with refractive index detector and a high-performance
liquid chromatography data system (Shimadzu) was used. Mobile phase
was NaBr solution (pH 7.4, 0.1 M) with the flow rate of 1 mL/min for
the column, and pullulan was used as a standard with different molecular
weights obtained from Shodex Group, Tokyo, Japan.

4.5 Evaluation of Protein Aggregation Inhibition
by Poly-SPB
4.5.1 Enzymatic Activity of
Lysozyme after Heating
in Poly-SPB
To study the protein aggregation inhibition using
poly-SPB, an enzymatic assay was done to determine the residual enzymatic
activity of lysozyme after its thermal aggregation. The solutions
of polymers at different concentrations (w/w %) were prepared in phosphate
buffer solution (PBS). The solution of M. lysodeikticus (0.25 mg/mL) and lysozyme (0.1 mg/mL) was prepared in PBS as well.
One hundred microliters of the polymer solution at different concentrations
and 100 μL of the lysozyme solution were mixed and heated at
90 °C for 30 min. One hundred microliters of this solution was
then taken and mixed with 2 mL of the solution of M.
lysodeikticus. To check the turbidity, UV–vis
measurements were made at 25 °C, and 600 nm for 6 min with constant
stirring for each sample, using a V-670 spectrophotometer (JASCO Inc.,
Japan).39

4.5.2 Aggregation
of Insulin in Poly-SPB
The UV–visible spectra were
recorded using UV–vis spectrophotometer
(UV-1800, Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan). The concentration of insulin
was 0.5 mg/mL; and the solutions of polymers at different concentrations
(w/w %) were prepared in PBS. Insulin in polymer solution was mixed
and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The absorbance was measured
at 0, 4, 7, 12, and 24 h to monitor the aggregation of insulin with
and without polymers at 500 nm.

4.5.3 Amyloid
Fibril Formation of Lysozyme and
Insulin
Thioflavin T (ThT) was used to measure the amyloid
fibrils, and stock solution was prepared by dissolving 8 mg ThT to
10 mL PBS (pH 7.4). The solution was then filtered through a 0.22
μm filter (Millex-GP Filter Unit). On diluting the stock solution,
working solution was prepared by adding 49 mL PBS to 1 mL of stock.
Lysozyme/insulin solution was mixed with the solution of polymer;
using PBS as the solvent, at different concentrations and heated to
90 °C for 30 min (insulin was incubated at 37 °C for 24
h). One hundred microliters of this solution was added to 2 mL of
the working solution of ThT and mixed well. Fluorescence intensity
was measured at an excitation wavelength of 450 nm and emission wavelength
of 484 nm using a JASCO FP-8600 spectrofluorometer.
