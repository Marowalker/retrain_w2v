“Smart”, dual pH-responsive,
and endosomolytic polymeric
nanoparticles have demonstrated great potential for localized drug
delivery, especially for siRNA delivery to the cytoplasm of cells.
However, targeted delivery to a specific cell phenotype requires an
additional level of functionality. Copper-catalyzed azide–alkyne
cycloaddition (CuAAC) is a highly selective bioconjugation reaction
that can be performed in conjunction with other polymerization techniques
without adversely affecting reaction kinetics, but there exists some
concern for residual copper causing cytotoxicity. To alleviate these
concerns, we evaluated conjugation efficiency, residual copper content,
and cell viability in relation to copper catalyst concentration. Our
results demonstrated an optimal range for minimizing cytotoxicity
while maintaining high levels of conjugation efficiency, and these
conditions produced polymers with increased targeting to M2-polarized
macrophages, as well as successful delivery of therapeutic siRNA that
reprogrammed the macrophages to a proinflammatory phenotype.

Introduction
The development of
bioorthogonal chemistry has allowed for transformative
progress in using polymer chemistry in living systems. “Click”
chemistry encompasses the most specific of these reactions and can
be performed in aqueous conditions and in the presence of oxygen.1 The discovery of copper-catalyzed azide–alkyne
cycloaddition (CuAAC) in the early 2000s popularized the field since
the addition of copper(I) salt significantly increased the reaction
rate of 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition between azides and alkynes.2,3 Further development of a Cu(II) “precatalyst” with
a reducing agent, such as sodium ascorbate, enabled the use of solvents
composed of water and alcohol, which is necessary for reagents not
soluble in water alone.2,4 The nonharsh reaction conditions
of CuAAC allow for direct in vivo functionalization,1,5−7 and the high selectivity allows for the use of click
chemistry in conjunction with other polymerization techniques.8 However, one primary concern with this reaction
is the potential for copper-associated toxicity that can result from
residual copper catalyst.9−11 Although copper-free click reactions,
such as strain-promoted azide–alkyne cycloaddition, are available,
the required cyclooctynes are difficult/expensive to synthesize, bulky
and hydrophobic, and fail to produce regiospecificity associated with
CuAAC.12−14 Therefore, it is crucial to establish a method that
ensures the biological compatibility of CuAAC reaction products.

CuAAC is a powerful tool for functionalizing polymeric nanoparticles
(PNPs) with a targeting moiety by conjugating each reagent with an
azide or alkyne. Additionally, reverse addition–fragmentation
chain-transfer (RAFT) polymerization can be combined with click chemistry
to develop complex, “smart” PNPs that respond to physiological
cues such as pH or temperature.8,15−22 pH-responsive polymers can be used to induce endosomal escape and
thus preserve the functionality of small interfering RNA (siRNA) for
RNA interference (RNAi) therapies. These siRNA-condensing polymeric
complexes (polyplexes) can then be decorated with small molecules
using CuAAC. Our previous work has shown moderate success using a
decorated triblock polymer,23,24 but here, we describe
click conjugation to an improved diblock copolymer. The triblock copolymer
contained a 2-propylacrylic acid (PAA) block, but this reagent complicated
the overall synthesis procedure, making the polymer less reproducible.
For this reason, we developed a diblock copolymer, excluding PAA,
which was simpler to fabricate, easier to reproduce, and maintained
overall functionality.

The improved diblock copolymer comprises
a poly(ethylene glycol)
(PEG) corona and a diblock core consisting of dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate
(DMAEMA) and butyl methacrylate (BMA).25−27 The polymer, termed
PEGDB, can be fabricated with an azide group on the “outer”
end of the PEG chain, which allows for click conjugation with an alkyne-functionalized
targeting moiety. Here, we chose mannose to deliver RNAi therapies
to M2-polarized macrophages, which overexpress the CD206 mannose receptor.
Macrophages are the desired target since they are the most prevalent
immune cell type in many tumors, and elevated levels of tumor-associated
macrophages (TAMs) correlate with poor prognosis and reduced survival.28−32 Recent studies have shown the therapeutic potential for targeting
and “reprogramming” TAMs to function as M1 inflammatory
macrophages, such as delivering siRNA against IκBα, an
inhibitor of the classical nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway.24,33−36 By conjugating a mannose-alkyne onto our azide-PEGDB polymer (MnPEGDB)
via CuAAC, we develop a system capable of delivering therapeutic siRNA
to the desired macrophage phenotype, while retaining the ability to
induce endosomal escape. However, the residual copper in CuAAC reaction
products and targeting efficacy of MnPEGDB have not been quantitatively
characterized, creating uncertainties in the potential for toxicity
or off-target effects of this polymer formulation.

When initially
developing the diblock copolymer, we observed unexpected
toxicity in the MnPEGDB group compared to that in a PEGDB control
polymer (Supporting Information Figure S1). The presence of copper ions in the synthesis procedure of MnPEGDB
led us to examine residual copper content postreaction. To this end,
we evaluated conjugation efficiency and residual copper content using
a range of copper catalyst concentrations. We also evaluated toxicity
and uptake in several cell types. Once we determined the optimal reaction
conditions, we used that polymer to deliver siRNA to polarized macrophages
to quantify changes in gene and protein expressions related to macrophage
phenotype.

Results and Discussion
In this study, we directly examined
the effects of altering the
copper catalyst concentration for CuAAC reactions on both conjugation
efficiency and residual copper content. Although CuAAC chemistry has
been used previously to functionalize/decorate materials used in living
systems,5−7 our polymers, functionalized using a 1 mM copper
catalyst concentration, exhibited evident toxicity in contact with
immortalized human macrophages (Supporting Information Figure S1); this toxicity was not observed in
similar mannose-functionalized polymer formulations used previously
by our lab.23,24 Additionally, we have previously
used undecorated PEGDB polymers to deliver siRNA with limited toxic
effects observed both in vitro and in vivo;25,26,37 so, we hypothesized the resulting toxicity
stemmed from residual copper in this iteration of our polymer system.
To our knowledge, no studies have been performed that directly quantify
and compare CuAAC conjugation efficiency and residual copper content
as a function of copper catalyst concentration. Moreover, the targeting
specificity to M2-polarized macrophages for the resulting polyplexes
has not been described in relation to mannose decoration and residual
copper. Here, we show that an optimal range for copper catalyst concentration
can be achieved that improves M2 macrophage-specific targeting while
also reducing copper-associated toxicity.

Synthesis and Characterization
of Mannose-Functionalized Diblock
Copolymers
The reaction scheme for functionalizing azide-PEGDB
(AzPEGDB) with mannose-alkyne is shown in Scheme 1. To quantify the conjugation of mannose
onto the AzPEGDB polymers at each catalyst concentration, Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was used to examine the change
in height of the azide peak at 2100 cm–1. By comparing
peak height in the MnPEGDB polymers to that of the precursor AzPEGDB,
we estimated conjugation efficiency as a function of copper catalyst
concentration (Figure 1A). The lowest copper catalyst concentration (0.1 mM) resulted in
an azide peak height, which was not different from the height of the
unreacted AzPEGDB. All other copper catalyst concentrations (0.25
mM and above) resulted in a significantly decreased peak height at
2100 cm–1, suggesting the conversion of the azide
to a 1,2,3-triazole bond (Figure 1B).38,39 The average reduction in azide
peak for the higher catalyst concentrations (excluding 0.1 mM) was
64%, which is in the range of normal conjugation efficiency values
for click reactions involving large molecules/polymers that cause
steric hindrance.40,41 This significant decrease in
peak height suggests successful click conjugation of mannose onto
the polymers when using a catalyst concentration of 0.25 mM and above.
There was no significant improvement for conjugation efficiency when
using catalyst concentrations above 0.25 mM, which is a 4-fold reduction
relative to the commonly reported CuAAC catalyst concentration for
polymer conjugation.23,42

polymers, including a detailed view of azide peaks. (B) Quantified
height of the azide peaks confirmed that the CuAAC reaction depends
on copper catalyst concentration. (C) Residual copper content, normalized
to the amount of polymer, revealed that altering the copper catalyst
concentration does affect the amount of copper ions associated with
the final polymer.

Scheme 1 Copper Catalyst Concentration
Controls the Level of Residual Copper
in the Final Polymer
After fabrication
of the MnPEGDB and removal of residual copper
using a Chelex resin following previously published methods,23,43 the polymers were dissolved in ethanol and molecular-grade water.
Residual copper was measured using a colorimetric assay that detects
Cu2+ ions, and the assay results (copper ions in μg/dL)
were normalized to provide mg of copper per mg of polymer. Residual
copper in the final polymer product was significantly reduced for
all catalyst concentrations below 1 mM (Figure 1C). Residual copper concentration for the
lowest tested catalyst concentration (0.1 mM) was not significantly
different from the PEGDB control polymer, which was not exposed to
the CuAAC reaction conditions. Residual copper in the polymers produced
using the three middle catalyst concentrations (0.25, 0.5, and 0.75
mM) was not significantly different from each other.

Other groups
have previously reported the use of copper ligands
as an alternative technique for employing CuAAC reactions to minimize
the amount of residual copper.44,45 However, this method
is primarily employed for click conjugation performed in biological
systems, such as directly functionalizing cell membranes, since postreaction
treatment is not feasible. For our applications, we can treat the
resulting polymers with a chelating reagent that functions similar
to the ligands by binding and removing excess copper ions. To minimize
the complexity of polymer fabrication, we chose to use a copper salt
catalyst that could be removed post-treatment. This technique revealed
that copper catalyst concentrations of 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 mM supported
robust click conjugation and resulted in significantly reduced residual
copper concentrations, suggesting that these were the optimal candidates
for the synthesis of MnPEGDB intended for future use in living systems.

Formation of Mannosylated Polyplexes
To assess the
toxicity and delivery of the mannosylated carriers, we complexed the
polymers with oligonucleotides to form polyplexes (Scheme 2). The MnPEGDB polymers, as
well as a nonmannosylated PEGDB control polymer, were dissolved in
a pH 4 buffer to protonate the amine groups on the DMAEMA monomers.
Then, either Cy5-functionalized dsDNA (Cy5-dsDNA) or siRNA was added
to the polymer solution and allowed to complex for 30 min. The solution
was restored to physiological pH by adding 5× volume of a pH
8 buffer. Polyplex diameter (z-average) and surface
charge were examined to ensure all polymer formulations were similar.
The average diameter was approximately 150 nm with no differences
among polymer groups (Figure 2A,B). The polymer synthesis conditions were selected to produce
micelle diameters of approximately 150 nm for eventual efficiency
in tumor accumulation after intravenous injection in vivo.46−48 The polydispersity index for each polymer was less than 0.3 (Supporting
Information Table S2), which is below the
generally accepted value for drug delivery applications.49 ζ-Potentials for all polymers were not
statistically different (p > 0.05) and were near
neutral, which is appropriate for intravascular administration (Figure 2C,D).50 Overall, the size and surface charge characteristics
of the polyplexes were appropriate for delivery to the tumor microenvironment
after intravascular injection.

Figure 2 Polyplexes were suspended in deionized
water, and Z-average diameter (A) distribution and
(B) averages were measured
with dynamic light scattering. Additionally, surface charge (C) distribution
and (D) averages were measured by ζ-potential measurement.

The protonated amine group on
the DMAEMA electrostatically interacts with the negative phosphates
on the oligonucleotide, spontaneously forming a stable micelle with
mannose presented on the corona of the polyplex.

In Vitro Polyplex Toxicity Examination
The toxicity
associated with residual copper in polyplexes was examined in multiple
cell types. All cells were treated with a polyplex concentration corresponding
to a 50 nM dose of siRNA, as done previously.23−25 Cells were
incubated with polyplexes for 24 h before evaluating viability with
a luminescent ATP-reporting assay. ThP-1 immortalized human macrophages
demonstrated a significant decrease in viability when treated with
polymers prepared with 0.1 or 1 mM copper catalyst compared to untreated
controls (Figure 3A).
The polymer fabricated with 1 mM catalyst had the highest amount of
residual copper (Figure 1C), which is presumed to lead to the observed toxicity. Notably,
the 0.1 mM catalyst group, which had the least amount of residual
copper, also produced significant toxicity. The FTIR results (Figure 1B), however, suggest
that this polymer had the largest residual azide peak, indicating
the least amount of mannose conjugation and, presumably, the largest
number of residual azides on the polymer. Azides are also known to
be cytotoxic, and we interpret the toxicity of the 0.1 mM polymer
to be due to unreacted azides on the AzPEGDB.51 This interesting observation of azide toxicity has been neglected
in previous considerations of cytotoxicity from CuAAC reaction products,
which have focused exclusively on the role of residual copper. Clearly,
the optimal copper catalyst concentration is a balance between excess
residual copper and relatively few unreacted azides and low residual
copper but a greater concentration of remaining cytotoxic azides.
Therefore, the optimal catalyst concentration range to limit cell
toxicity in human macrophages for our polyplexes is between 0.25 and
0.75 mM, which corroborates the results of click conjugation and copper
content.

Figure 3 Macrophage viability assessed with polyplex treatment and Cu2+ treatment. (A) Viability of ThP-1 human macrophages was
significantly decreased when treated with polyplexes fabricated with
0.1 and 1 mM copper catalysts. (B) M0 and M2 bone-marrow-derived macrophages
(BMDMs) displayed no toxicity in any treatment groups, but all M1
BMDMs had slight toxicity. (C) All macrophages displayed a trend of
decreasing viability as the concentration of copper salt treatment
increased.

To explore the impact of polyplexes
on the viability of primary
macrophages with varying levels of CD206 expression, bone-marrow-derived
macrophages (BMDMs) were cultured with cytokines to polarize them
to either an M1 (CD206low) or M2 (CD206high)
phenotype. Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and lipopolysaccharide
(LPS) were added to polarize BMDMs toward M1, and interleukin- (IL-)
4 and IL-13 were used to induce M2 polarization.52 An additional group of unpolarized BMDMs (M0) was cultured
in media with no cytokine treatment. BMDM skewing was characterized
via flow cytometry by examining the expression of CD11b and F4/80
(general macrophage markers), CD86 (M1 marker), and CD206 (M2 marker)
(Supporting Information Figure S5). Following
cytokine treatment, we observed significantly higher levels of CD86
expression in M1 macrophages compared to those in both M0 and M2 phenotypes.
M2-polarized BMDMs had significantly higher expression of CD206 compared
to both M1 and M0, and the M1 macrophages had a decreased level, though
not statistically different, compared to unpolarized BMDMs. These
results are consistent with the establishment of a CD206low population of M1s and a CD206high population of M2s.
All three groups of BMDMs were treated with polyplexes as performed
with ThP-1 cells. Unpolarized (M0) and CD206high (M2) BMDMs
demonstrated no significant changes in viability with all treatments
remaining above 90% viable compared to an untreated control (Figure 3B). Interestingly,
the viability of CD206low M1 macrophages, but not M0 or
M2 macrophages, was significantly reduced following exposure to polyplexes
prepared with a 0.25–1 mM copper catalyst concentration (Figure 3B). This broad-ranging
effect suggests a mechanism independent of the residual copper content.
Classically activated macrophages initially respond to infection by
producing inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and reactive oxygen
species but the resolution of the inflammatory reaction has been reported
to involve mitochondrial-dependent macrophage cell death.53,54 Therefore, we hypothesize that the loss of viability observed in
the M1-polarized macrophages is induced by their additional activation
in response to particle endocytosis. The lack of toxicity in M2 macrophages
is encouraging for our applications. It is also important to note
that although the same copper-associated toxicity found in ThP-1 macrophages
was not observed in BMDMs, there is still a concern for the toxic
effects of copper in human macrophages for potential future applications.
Additionally, we show that the polymer alone (PEGDB control) does
not induce a significant change in macrophage viability. This diblock
copolymer has been previously shown to be nontoxic to cells, and we
confirm those results here.26,27,37

All viability studies were repeated in human and murine triple-negative
breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines and a nontumorigenic human mammary
epithelial cell line. MDA-MB-231 cells were chosen since they are
well-established models with well-characterized properties and display
a basal-like triple-negative phenotype.55 E0771 cells were chosen as the murine equivalent since they are
also basal-like triple-negative breast cancer cells, but are less
aggressive than the often-used 4T1 model and therefore a better model
for our applications.56 MCF10a cells provide
a nontumorigenic, mammary epithelial control, but a murine analog
could not be identified among many commercial sources; so, only human
mammary cells were included in this study. Treatment with polyplexes
for 24 h generated minimal toxicity in both TNBC cell lines. MDA-MB-231
cells treated with the 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 mM copper-catalyzed polymers
maintained viability of over 90% but were still statistically decreased
compared to the untreated control (Supporting Information Figure S6A). The E0771 cells exhibited a significant
decrease in viability in all polyplex treatments, but none of the
treated groups were different from each other (Supporting Information Figure S6B). Similarly, the MCF10a human mammary
epithelial cells had baseline toxicity from the polyplex treatments
compared to the untreated control (Supporting Information Figure S6C). Interestingly, when compared to
the PEGDB control polymer, MCF10a cells only had significantly decreased
viability when treated with polymers made with 0.1 and 1 mM copper
catalysts. These results are consistent with the ThP-1 human macrophages
as these groups are presumed to have the highest number of azides
(0.1 mM) and highest residual copper content (1 mM). In both E0771
and MCF10a cells, there does appear to be a slight decrease in viability
in all polymer groups, indicating a potential cytotoxic effect from
just the polymer system. The lack of toxicity in macrophages is encouraging
for our applications, but we will take the off-target toxicity into
consideration as we continue forward with our experiments. Overall,
the range of a 0.25–0.75 mM copper catalyst appears optimal
for fabricating polyplexes that have minimal toxicity to both macrophages
and mammary cells.

Effects of Copper Salt on Cell Viability
To assess
the contributions of copper(II) alone to cell viability, each cell
type was treated with a range of known CuCl2 concentrations.
In general, copper is known to be toxic to cells, but only above a
threshold concentration.10,57 This study allowed
us to characterize the lower limits of copper cytotoxicity and inform
the selection of CuAAC reaction conditions to enable the use of the
click reactions for biological applications. In human immortalized
macrophages, as well as primary BMDMs, we observed a trend of decreasing
viability as Cu2+ concentration increased, but there was
no significant change in viability up to 0.009 mg/mL, and only the
ThP-1 cells had a significant decrease in viability at 0.01 mg/mL
(Figure 3C). These
findings are important for our applications since the highest amount
of residual copper associated with the 1 mM MnPEGDB was approximately
6-fold lower at 0.0015 mg/mL, as determined with the copper assay.
Although these results indicate that our CuAAC products are well below
the cutoff for copper-induced cytotoxicity, our polymer system, in
particular, appears to cause cell death at an elevated level when
the residual copper concentration is above 0.0006 mg/mL. This relationship
between residual copper content and cell viability demonstrates that
functionalization via CuAAC can produce biocompatible biomaterials
by altering the amount of copper catalyst used.

Copper salt
toxicity was also examined in TNBC and epithelial cell lines. MDA-MB-231
human TNBC cells and MCF10a human epithelial cells showed no significant
change in viability at any Cu2+ concentration, although
both did exhibit a trend in decreasing viability with increasing copper
concentration. E0771 murine TNBC cells produced a trend of decreasing
viability, though not statistically significant until the maximum
dose (Supporting Information Figure S6D). Notably, the human cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MCF10a) were not
as susceptible to copper-associated toxicity at 0.1 mg/mL compared
to all other examined cells. This result indicates that the concern
for copper-associated toxicity in the human breast tumor microenvironment
is minimal, providing support for the use of CuAAC in potential human
therapeutics. Based on these results, the residual Cu2+ alone is not a predictor of cytotoxicity. Rather, the context of
polymer, cargo, cell type, and the interaction with residual copper
and azide control overall cytotoxicity.

Targeting Efficacy of Mannose-Functionalized
Micelles
To evaluate the ability of mannose conjugation to
increase uptake
in CD206high cells, polyplexes were fabricated with Cy5-dsDNA
and treated with cells at an optimized time point of 2 h. Cell-associated
fluorescence intensity was measured as an index of polyplex uptake,
and results were normalized to the PEGDB control polymer to demonstrate
mannose-specific uptake of the decorated polyplexes. In ThP-1 human
macrophages, the MnPEGDB produced with a 0.75 mM copper catalyst significantly
increased uptake efficiency compared to all other polymer groups (Figure 4A). The polymers
catalyzed with 0.25 and 0.5 mM copper show slight, but nonsignificant,
increases in uptake. Unchanged uptake in the 0.1 and 1 mM groups is
presumed to be due to increased toxicity associated with those polymers.
Our measure of cytotoxicity was an ATP reporter, and since endocytosis
is an ATP-dependent process, early disruption in ATP production may
significantly suppress subsequent endocytosis of polyplexes. Polarized
BMDMs were then used to examine the effects of CD206 expression on
polyplex uptake. There was no significant difference in uptake regardless
of mannose decoration for M0 or M1 BMDMs. In the M2-polarized macrophages,
however, the polymer produced with a 0.75 mM copper catalyst led to
significantly increased uptake compared to the 0.1 and 1 mM groups,
but not the 0.25 and 0.5 mM catalyst groups (Figure 4B). These results are consistent with our
observations in human macrophages (Figure 4A), as well as the FTIR mannose conjugation
results (Figure 1B),
which indicated that CuAAC efficiency was not changed when increasing
beyond a 0.25 mM copper catalyst concentration. Even more importantly,
the 0.75 mM group was the only micelle treatment that produced significantly
increased uptake in CD206high macrophages compared to both
M0 and CD206low, M1 macrophages. To verify that uptake
was due to CD206-specific uptake, we repeated uptake experiment in
M2-polarized BMDMs using the optimized polymer groups (0.25–0.75
mM) and cotreated with free mannose sugar to block the CD206 receptor.
By averaging across the three optimized groups, we determined that
mannosylated polyplex binding was decreased by almost 60% (Supporting
Information Figure S7). These results indicate
that polyplex uptake is CD206-dependent. Based on these results from
both human and murine macrophages, using a copper catalyst concentration
of 0.75 mM for the CuAAC led to significantly increased macrophage
uptake and was shown to increase uptake in CD206high macrophages.

Figure 4 Polyplex
uptake evaluated in human and murine macrophages. (A)
ThP-1 human macrophages displayed preferential uptake of polyplexes
formed with the 0.75 mM copper catalyst. (B) 0.75 mM catalyzed polymer
targeted CD206high BMDMs over CD206low, as well
as unpolarized macrophages (#p < 0.05),
indicating mannose specificity. The 0.75 mM group also outperformed
the PEGDB control, 0.1 mM, and 1 mM groups in just M2-polarized BMDMs
(**p < 0.01).

When examining uptake in mammary epithelial cells, both human cell
lines (MDA-MB-231 and MCF10a) revealed no preferential uptake among
the polymer groups (Supporting Information Figure S8). The E0771 murine TNBC cells demonstrated a significant
increase in uptake for the 0.75 mM group compared to that for the
1 mM group, but this change was not statistically different compared
to all other polymer groups. Overall, our results indicate an optimal
concentration of a 0.75 mM copper catalyst for minimizing copper-induced
toxicity, as well as promoting mannose-associated targeting to CD206-expressing
macrophages.

Evaluation of siRNA-Induced Macrophage Repolarization
We used the optimal MnPEGDB polymer prepared with a 0.75 mM copper
catalyst concentration to treat M1- and M2-polarized BMDMs with either
scrambled or IκBα siRNA. We treated the macrophages with
siRNA-loaded polyplexes for 24 h before collecting the cells and isolating
RNAs for use in reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
To examine a shift in phenotype, we examined mRNA expression of six
genes: three M1 genes (CD86, TNF-α, iNOS), one M2 gene (CD206),
and one general macrophage marker (F4/80).24,58,59 The final mRNA we evaluated was IκBα,
which we used to assess the ability of our siRNA sequence to knock
down the target gene. Relative gene expression was normalized to an
untreated control group of the corresponding polarization.

Treatment
with IκBα siRNA resulted in a significant increase in
CD86 and TNF-α compared to that with untreated control and scrambled
siRNA treatments in both M1 and M2 BMDMs, and we observed a significant
increase in iNOS expression, but only in the M2-polarized macrophages
(Figure 5A–C).
Furthermore, CD206 significantly decreased after IκBα
siRNA treatment compared to the untreated control in both phenotypes,
but, interestingly, there was no significant change in CD206 expression
between the scrambled siRNA control and the IκBα siRNA
in M2 BMDMs. Most importantly, treatment with the therapeutic siRNA
significantly decreased IκBα expression in both phenotypes,
which is necessary for activating the classical pathway of NF-κB
(Figure 5D,E). Taken
together, these results indicate that not only is the IκBα
siRNA pushing M2 macrophages toward an M1 phenotype but the treatment
does not significantly impact overall M1 macrophage gene expression.
Finally, the expression of F4/80, which is known to be associated
with macrophage activation,60,61 increases in M2 BMDMs
treated with IκBα siRNA (Figure 5F). This result indicates that not only are
the alternatively activated macrophages being skewed toward an M1
phenotype but they are also in a more activated state. The delivery
of IκBα siRNA with our optimized polyplex system successfully
skews M2 macrophages back to a classical phenotype, which is necessary
for eventual application in inducing an inflammatory macrophage response
in tumors.

Figure 5 RT-PCR was used to examine relative mRNA expression after treatment
with scrambled or IκBα siRNA. Expression was normalized
to an untreated control group of the corresponding polarization (M1
vs M2). To assess a change in macrophage phenotype, we examined the
expression of the following: (A) CD86, a surface marker for inflammatory
immune cells, (B) TNF-α, a proinflammatory cytokine, (C) iNOS,
an IFN-γ induced isoform of nitric oxide synthase, (D) CD206,
the macrophage mannose receptor overexpressed on M2 macrophages, (E)
IκBα, an inhibitor of the classical NF-κB pathway,
and (F) F4/80, a general macrophage marker.

To confirm macrophage repolarization after the delivery of IκBα
siRNA, we also evaluated protein expression. BMDMs expressing an NF-κB-dependent
green fluorescent protein (GFP)/luciferase reporter (BMDM-NGL) were
polarized to an M2 phenotype and then treated with either phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) (negative control), M1 cytokines (IFN-γ and LPS,
positive control), or mannosylated polyplexes loaded with scrambled
or IκBα siRNA. After 24 h of treatment, the cells were
harvested in a reporter lysis buffer, which allowed for direct quantification
of luminescence. The IκBα siRNA demonstrated elevated
NF-κB activity as indicated by an increase in luminescence.
This activation was on the level of M1 polarization, which provides
evidence for successful phenotype repolarization (Figure 6A). In addition, the same treatments
were repeated, and the cells were collected for Western blot to directly
examine protein expression levels. By delivering the IκBα
siRNA in our optimized MnPEGDB polymer, we demonstrate a significant
knockdown in IκBα protein expression, as well as a significant
decrease in arginase-1 (Arg-1) expression, which is a protein overexpressed
in M2 macrophages (Figure 6B,C). In conjunction with the results of RT-PCR, these results
indicate that our polyplex system loaded with IκBα siRNA
is able to repolarize macrophages from an M2 toward an M1 phenotype.

Conclusions
We have optimized the reaction conditions
for functionalizing polymeric
micelles with a targeting moiety using CuAAC. By altering the concentration
of a copper catalyst, we demonstrated an optimal range for efficient
conjugation while minimizing residual copper and azide contents. Our
results indicated that cytotoxicity is a balance between excess Cu2+ and residual azides. Our observation of azide toxicity due
to incomplete CuAAC reaction is an underappreciated and avoidable
potential cause of cell injury. Moreover, we showed that copper-associated
toxicity can be eliminated from our polymer system and that residual
copper alone is not the main predictor of cytotoxicity. The toxicity
observed in our polymer system appears to be synergistically associated
with residual copper and the material system as a whole, both of which
may exhibit exacerbated toxicity due to the intracellular delivery
of the polyplexes. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine
the cytotoxic effects of copper salt alone compared to those of copper
ions associated with our polyplex system. These results indicate that
concerns for negative biological impacts of CuAAC reaction products
can be mitigated by altering the reaction conditions. Overall, we
show that CuAAC should not be discouraged for in vivo applications,
but we recognize that some optimization of copper catalyst concentration
and confirmation of low toxicity for each formulation/system may be
necessary.

Mannosylated micelles prepared from our simplified
polymer system
enable increased delivery to human macrophages, as well as CD206high primary murine macrophages, which is an improvement over
the previous PEGDB polymer that can deliver siRNA, but does not confer
cell-specific delivery. This optimized polymer system also successfully
delivered therapeutic siRNA and induced a shift in gene expression
indicative of macrophage “repolarization” from an M2
phenotype toward an inflammatory M1 phenotype. We confirmed this repolarization
by demonstrating a shift in mRNA expression for several M1/M2 markers,
as well as increased activation of NF-κB protein, indicative
of classical macrophage activation. This improved polyplex formulation
will be used in future studies to repolarize TAMs in cocultures with
tumor cells to quantify the cancer-killing properties of the macrophages.

Materials
and Methods
Materials
All materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
unless otherwise noted. Inhibitors were removed from dimethylaminoethyl
methacrylate (DMAEMA) and butyl methacrylate (BMA) using an activated
basic aluminum oxide column.25,26 All DNA oligonucleotides
were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA).
dsDNA was designed to be length-matched to the therapeutic IκBα
siRNA and functionalized with a cyanine-5 (Cy5) fluorophore on the
5′ end of the antisense strand. IκBα siRNA was
designed based on previous studies done in our lab.24

Polymer Synthesis
Mannose-alkyne
was fabricated as
previously described.23 All diblock copolymers
were fabricated using 4-cyano-4-(ethylsulfanylthiocarbonyl)-sulfanylpentanoic
acid (ECT) as a chain-transfer agent (CTA) conjugated to either azide-PEG
(AzPEG) or PEG. ECT was synthesized as previously described.62,63 The AzPEG and PEG macro-CTAs were then RAFT-polymerized with DMAEMA
and BMA at a 50:50 molar ratio as previously described.23−25 AzPEGDB was then conjugated with mannose-alkyne via CuAAC chemistry
to produce MnPEGDB. All polymers were characterized using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy (Bruker,
400 MHz), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, Bruker Tensor
27), and a copper assay kit (Sigma-Aldrich). All NMR spectra are shown
in Supporting Information Figures S2–S4. Details for the polymer synthesis appear in Supporting Information Materials and Methods.

Polyplex Formation
All polymeric complexes (polyplexes)
were formed as previously described.23−26 Initially, polymers were complexed
with Cy5-labeled dsDNA, scrambled siRNA, or IκBα siRNA
for 30 min in a 10 mM citrate buffer (pH = 4). The solution was restored
to pH = 7.4 by adding a 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH = 8) at 5×
volume of the pH 4 solution. Polyplex N+/P– ratio was determined by the mole ratio of protonated amines in DMAEMA
polymer (assuming 50% protonation at physiological pH) to the number
of phosphates on dsDNA/siRNA.25,26 All polyplex treatments
were performed at a dose of 50 nM dsDNA/siRNA with N+/P– 10:1. Particle size and ζ-potential were characterized
using a Malvern Zetasizer located in the Vanderbilt Institute of Nanoscale
Science and Engineering (VINSE) core facility.

Cell Culture
ThP-1
Immortalized human macrophage cells (ThP-1) were
chosen to evaluate toxicity in a human equivalent to inform potential
future translatability of our polymer system. ThP-1 human monocytes
were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium
(Thermo Fisher Scientific; 11879-020) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS), 25 mM HEPES, 1% penicillin–streptomycin
(P/S), 1% minimum essential medium vitamins, and 4.4 μL β-mercaptoethanol
at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. To differentiate
monocytes into mature macrophages, ThP-1 cells were plated in the
aforementioned media supplemented with 0.1% (v/v) phorbol 12-myristate
13-acetate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and incubated for 4 days to
allow for differentiation into mature macrophages.64,65 These cells were primarily chosen as a human line to use for viability
studies, but the expression of a mannose receptor also allows us to
examine targeted uptake.66 Cells were plated
in 96-well plates at 1 × 105 cells/well in 100 μL
media. Polyplex or copper salt treatments were added on day 4.

L929
L929 murine fibroblasts were used to produce supplemental
media for culturing bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) taken
from mice. L929 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Corning, Inc., Corning, NY; 15-013-CV)
supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% l-glutamine, and 1% P/S. L929
cells were grown to confluency in T-175 flasks, and 55 mL fresh media
was added. On day 7, the media was collected, labeled L929 Week 1
media, and stored at −20 °C. A fresh 55 mL media was added,
cultured for an additional 7 days, collected, and labeled L929 Week
2 media before being stored at −20 °C.

BMDM
All animal work was approved by the Vanderbilt
University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Healthy female
FVB mice were sacrificed at 4–8 weeks of age, and the femurs
and tibias were extracted. The bone marrow was flushed out with DMEM
using a 5 mL syringe and collected in DMEM (Corning; 15-018-CV). The
cell suspension was centrifuged (Thermo Scientific, Sorvall ST 8 Centrifuge)
at 1000g for 5 min. Media was aspirated before resuspending
the cell pellet in a 2 mL ACK (ammonium, chloride, potassium) lysing
buffer (KD Medical, Columbia, MD) and incubating on ice for 2 min
to lyse red blood cells. The lysis solution was diluted in 20 mL DMEM
and again centrifuged at 1000g for 5 min. The media
was aspirated, and the resulting BMDMs were resuspended in a 10 mL
BMDM media: DMEM (15-018-CV) with 10% FBS, 1% P/S, 1% l-glutamine,
and 14% 1:1 (v/v) L929 week 1 and week 2 media. The cells were counted
by mixing a 10 μL cell suspension with 10 μL Trypan Blue
stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and pipetting 10 μL of the
resulting mixture into a cell counter slide (Bio-Rad) and running
on an automated cell counter (Bio-Rad, TC20). BMDMs were seeded in
12-well plates at 1 × 106 cells/well in 1 mL media
or in 96-well plates at 1 × 105 cells/well in 100
μL media. To induce M1 and M2 polarizations, BMDMs were incubated
with M1- or M2-inducing cytokines.52 Briefly,
all cells were plated on day 0. On day 2, cells were washed with sterile
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then cultured with fresh media.
On day 4, fresh media was added to M0 and M1 BMDMs, while M2 macrophages
were treated with media supplemented with 0.01 μg/mL IL-4 and
0.02 μg/mL IL-13. On day 7, M0 and M2 macrophages were not changed,
while M1 BMDMs received media supplemented with 0.1 μg/mL IFN-γ
and 0.1 ng/mL LPS. On day 8, cells were treated for the appropriate
experiment.

E0771
Murine breast cancer cells
were used as a comparison
to the BMDMs described previously. E0771 cells were cultured in RPMI
1640 (Thermo Fisher Scientific; 11875-093) supplemented with 10% FBS,
1% P/S, and 25 mM HEPES.

MDA-MB-231
Human breast cancer cells
were used as a
comparison to human ThP-1 macrophages. MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured
in DMEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific; 11960-044) supplemented with 10%
FBS, 1% l-glutamine, and 1% P/S.

MCF10a
Human epithelial
cells were used as a healthy
tissue control for all treatments. MCF10a cells were cultured in bronchial
epithelial cell growth medium (BEBM) supplemented with a BEBM Bulletkit
(Lonza, Morristown, NJ).

Flow Cytometry
BMDMs were polarized, washed with 0.5
mL PBS, and then incubated with 0.5 mL of 0.25% trypsin–EDTA
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 5 min. Media of 1 mL was added to each
well, and cells were repeatedly aspirated with a disposable pipette
to dislodge them from the surface and collected in 15 mL conical tubes.
Tubes were centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant
was aspirated. The cell pellet was resuspended in 2 mL of fresh BMDM
media, and the cells were counted as previously described. Cells were
then placed in a 96-well round-bottom weight flask at 1 × 106 cells/well in 300 μL/well. The plate was spun down
at 1500 rpm for 5 min and inverted and lightly tapped to remove the
supernatant without losing cell pellets. An Fc block consisting of
1 μL Fc block (Biolegend, San Diego, CA) and 50 μL of
flow cytometry (FACS) staining buffer (PBS with 2% FBS) was added
to each well. Plates were stored at 4 °C for 10 min. A macrophage
panel of antibodies consisting of the following was added: CD11b (1:400),
F4/80 (1:200), CD86 (1:200), and CD206 (1:200) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA). Each antibody was added in 50 μL of FAC buffer and so the
total volume when calculating the concentrations was in 100 μL
per sample. Plates were stored at 4 °C in the dark to allow for
staining. Plates were spun down at 1500 rpm for 5 min and inverted
and tapped to remove the supernatant. Each well was resuspended in
a 200 μL FACS buffer and analyzed by flow cytometry.

Viability
Assays
Polyplex Toxicity
Each cell type was cultured in 96-well
plates for viability assays. BMDMs and ThP-1s were plated at 1 ×
105 cells/well, while all other cells were plated at 25 000
cells/well. BMDMs and ThP-1s followed the plating protocols listed
above. The other cell types were plated, incubated overnight to allow
cells to adhere, and treated with polyplexes. All cells were treated
with 50 nM of Cy5-dsDNA loaded into the various polymer formulations.
The cells were incubated for 24 h before conducting a CellTiter-Glo
Luminescence Assay (Promega, Madison, WI). All luminescent results
were normalized to the average of the control well luminescence.

Copper Salt Toxicity
All cell types were plated as
performed to assess polyplex toxicity. CuCl2 was dissolved
at 1 mg/mL in 10% (v/v) 200-proof ethanol and media (specific for
cell type). This solution was then diluted to a range of 50–10 000
μg/dL, and 100 μL was added to each well. All cells were
incubated for 24 h before running the CellTiter-Glo luminescence assay.

Polyplex Uptake
Cells were plated in 96-well plates
and treated with 50 nM of Cy5-dsDNA-loaded polyplexes. The cells were
incubated with the polyplexes for 2 h and then washed 3× with
100 μL PBS. A final volume of 100 μL PBS was added, and
the fluorescence intensity was measured (Tecan Infinite M1000 Pro).
All fluorescence results were normalized to the fluorescence of the
PEGDB control polyplexes to determine mannose-associated uptake. To
examine CD206-specific uptake of mannosylated polyplexes, we also
performed a receptor-blocking experiment where polyplexes were added
to media containing 100 mg/mL molecular-grade D-mannose, as done previously.23 The free mannose binds CD206 and prevents receptor-mediated
uptake of fluorescent polyplexes. To evaluate the decrease in uptake,
the optimized copper catalyst concentration (0.25–0.75 mM)
groups were averaged together since they demonstrated similar azide
reduction.

Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase
Chain Reaction
(RT-PCR)
BMDMs were plated in 12-well plates as described
previously. After polarization to M1 and M2, the MnPEGDB fabricated
with a 0.75 mM copper catalyst was used to form polyplexes with either
scrambled siRNA or IκBα siRNA. BMDMs were treated for
24 h before mRNA was isolated from the cultured cells using the RNeasy
Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Residual DNA was removed using the
RNase-Free DNase set (Qiagen). cDNA synthesis was performed using
SuperScript IV reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen). The RT-PCR
reaction was performed using an SYBR Green PCR super mix (Bio-Rad)
and CFX real-time PCR instrument and software (Bio-Rad). Normalized
levels of mRNA expression were calculated using the ΔΔCt
method with GAPDH as an internal control. Each mRNA was normalized
to an untreated control group of the corresponding polarization (M1
vs M2). All primer sequences used are summarized in Supporting Information Table S1.

Luciferase Assays
Luciferase activity was measured
in immortalized bone-marrow-derived macrophages derived from transgenic
mice, which carry an NF-κB-dependent GFP/luciferase reporter
(BMDM-NGL) on the FVB strain background. BMDM-NGL cells were polarized
toward M2 by IL-4 treatment for 24 h, followed by a further 24 h treatment
with PBS (control), IFN-γ and LPS (M1-polarized control), or
mannosylated polyplexes loaded with either scrambled siRNA or IκBα-targeting
siRNA. Cells were harvested in reporter lysis buffer and luminescence
measured by the Promega Luciferase Assay system (Cat #4030) using
a GloMax Luminometer (Promega, Madison, WI). Results were expressed
as relative light units normalized for protein content, as measured
by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Cat #500-0002).

Western Blotting
BMDM-NGL cells were polarized toward
M2 by IL-4 treatment for 24 h, followed by a further 24 h treatment
with PBS (control), IFN-γ and LPS (M1-polarized control), or
mannosylated polyplexes loaded with either scrambled siRNA or IκBα-targeting
siRNA. Whole cell protein isolation, Western blotting, and signal
detection were performed as described (PMID: 26215403). Primary antibodies
used were mouse monoclonal anti-IκBα (Cell Signaling Technology;
Cat #4814; 1:1000 dilution), rabbit polyclonal antiarginase-1 (Gene
Tex; Cat #GTX109242; 1:200 dilution), and mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin
(Sigma Chemical Co., Cat #A5441 1:10 000 dilution) as loading
control.

Statistical Analysis
All data are presented as mean
± standard error of the mean (SEM) except RT-PCR, which is shown
as mean ± upper/lower limit. For all FTIR, copper assay, and
ThP-1 polyplex toxicity studies, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
with Tukey’s post hoc test was used to compare all groups to
all other groups. For copper salt viability assays, a two-way ANOVA
with Dunnett’s post hoc test was used to compare all concentrations
to the control within each cell type. For the BMDM polyplex toxicity
studies and all polyplex uptake studies, a two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s
post hoc test was used to compare all groups to all other groups.
For all RT-PCR results, ΔΔCt values were compared using
a one-ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test. Luciferase assay and
Western blotting signal detection were analyzed using Student’s t test. To establish statistical significance, we used the
following: *p < 0.05, **p <
0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p <
0.0001.
