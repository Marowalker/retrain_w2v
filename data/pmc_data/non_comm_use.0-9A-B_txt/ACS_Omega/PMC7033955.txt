With the aim to develop chemical
adsorbents that are inherently
nontoxic to living beings and the environment, a gel system based
on thiol–norbornene photoclick chemistry was developed. Norbornene
was strategically functionalized with different poly(ethylene glycol)
(PEG) chains to produce PEG-functionalized macromonomers. The influence
of incorporating PEG in the cross-linked network was evaluated on
the basis of its physical properties and dye-removing efficiency from
aqueous solutions. The excellent swelling ability of the gels in organic
solvents was found to improve with the PEG chain length. The rheological
measurements of the as-synthesized materials also exhibited the presence
of elasticity in the network, and a decrease in storage and loss moduli
was observed with an increase in PEG molecular weight. The materials
possess excellent thermal stability, which enhanced with an increase
in PEG chain length, as revealed from thermogravimetric analysis (TGA).
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) studies revealed the tendency
of higher-molecular-weight PEG to form a crystalline phase in the
network. Kinetic studies of dye removal from aqueous solutions by
the as-prepared cross-linked networks indicate that the dye removal
proceeds via pseudo-second-order kinetics. The study of adsorption
isotherm of the removal process indicates that the adsorption follows
the Langmuir isotherm model. In this present work, we have thoroughly
evaluated the influence of PEG chain length on several physical properties
and toxic cationic dye removal efficiencies of thiol–norbornene
photo-cross-linked networks.

Introduction
Contamination of water
with toxicants is a major threat to life.
Untreated industrial discharges comprising water-soluble organic dyes
can directly impair human life due to their carcinogenicity and acute
toxicity.1,2 Over 50 000 tons of dyes that are
commercially used in various textile, painting, paper, and cosmetics
industries are annually discharged into the environment.3,4 Dye-tainted water is associated with several risk factors for both
marine and human lives, as dyes are recalcitrant in nature, stable
to oxidizing agents, and resistant to aerobic digestion.5,6 Thus, removing dyes from wastewater is essential and demands the
attention of researchers. Several approaches, such as membrane separation,
biodegradation, coagulation–flocculation, photocatalysis, adsorption,
etc., have been reported for the treatment of wastewater.7,8 But most of the techniques are restricted from practical applications
due to their exorbitant price, lack of flexibility, and harsh synthetic
routes.9,10 In this regard, the adsorption process is
a promising alternative due to its ease of operation, high efficiency,
as well as economic viability.11,12 The necessary properties
that an ideal adsorbent must possess are low cost, high adsorption
capacity, selectivity, etc. Additionally, it is also essential to
check the toxicity of the adsorbent itself to avoid any secondary
pollution.13 Therefore, designing of an
appropriate adsorbent system is of prime importance. Though there
are plenty of literature examples regarding toxicant removal from
wastewater, very less attention has been paid toward its environmental
toxicity. Moreover, some adsorbents have been reported to show an
efficient activity only at a high temperature and a low pH, which
are barely the conditions in practical situations.4

In our previous work, we have reported that a thiol–norbornene
photo-cross-linked network is efficient to remove toxic cationic dyes
from wastewater.14 In this work, we wanted
to investigate the impact of incorporating poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)
of different chain lengths in the network structure. For the synthesis
of the cross-linked network, a similar fascinating UV-light-mediated
click chemistry between thiol and norbornene was performed. The thiol–norbornene
photoclick reaction is a step-growth polymerization technique that
yields uniform porous networks.15 This
click reaction is particularly advantageous as it is simple, versatile,
insensitive toward ambient water and oxygen, and can be carried out
in environmentally benign solvents.16 Norbornene
was strategically functionalized with different PEG chains to produce
PEG-functionalized macromonomers. The influence of incorporating PEG
in the cross-linked network was evaluated on the basis of its physical
properties and dye-removing efficiency. The characterization of the
cross-linker and macromonomers was carried out by standard spectroscopic
and analytical techniques. The materials were found to show excellent
swelling in organic solvents, and the swelling ratio improved with
an increase of PEG chain length. Rheological measurements of the as-synthesized
materials also exhibit the presence of elasticity in the network,
and a decrease in storage and loss moduli was observed with an increase
in the PEG molecular weight. Further, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
revealed that the materials possess excellent thermal stability, which
enhanced with an increase in the PEG chain length. The kinetics of
the dye removal by as-synthesized materials from aqueous solutions
was studied, and the results indicate that the dye removal proceeds
via pseudo-second-order kinetics. The adsorption process was found
to follow the Langmuir isotherm model. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first ever report describing the influence of PEG chain
length on the physical properties and toxic cationic dye removal efficiency
of norbornene-based cross-linked networks.

Results and Discussion
With the objective to develop a chemical adsorbent that is inherently
nontoxic to the environment, we have synthesized three gels based
on the thiol–norbornene click chemistry. Norbornene-based cross-linker 3 was synthesized using the previous report.14 Briefly, a Diels–Alder reaction between furan and
maleic anhydride was carried out to yield compound 1,
which was then treated with dry ethanol, N,N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine
(DMAP) to produce compound 2. Compound 3 was obtained by a coupling reaction between 1,6-hexanediol and compound 2 using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC)
and DMAP. Next, norbornene carboxylic acid was functionalized by PEG
having three different molecular weights of 600, 1450, and 4000 by
the Mitsunobu coupling reaction (Figure 1). The formation of three norbornene-functionalized
macromonomers (4, 5, and 6)
was characterized by 1H NMR spectra (Figures S1–S3). Then, the gelation condition was explored
(Figure 2). For that
purpose, compound 3 was dissolved in dichloromethane
(DCM) solutions containing compound 4, 5, or 6. Pentaerythritol tetrakis(3-mercaptopropionate)
(PETMP) and the photoinitiator were then added to them. Thereafter,
the solutions were cured under UV light for ∼30 min. The formation
of the gels was initially confirmed by the vial inversion method (Figure 2e). To verify the
role of compound 3, serving as a cross-linker, gelation
was carried out with compounds 4, 5, and 6 each without compound 3. The gel formation
took place with only two macromonomers, one with PEG 600 and the other
with PEG 1450. Photo-cross-linking did not result in gel formation
with PEG 4000 under a similar experimental condition even after a
prolonged irradiation time (>4 h).

thiol). (d) Pictures of gelation: before and after photoirradiation.

The cross-linking density of all of the synthesized
gels was analyzed
quantitatively by measuring the gel content.17,18 Briefly, the measured amount of each gel was soaked in DCM overnight
to remove any un-cross-linked reagent. Then, the swollen gels were
dried in vacuum and weighed again. The gel content was calculated
by the mass ratio of the gels before and after extraction. As an equal
molar ratio of the thiol and total norbornene was used, the gel content
suggests the amount of cross-linking.19 In this case, the gel content was found to be 92.1% for G1, 87.3%
for G2, and 84.1% for G3 (Figure 3b). Gel contents of around 62 and 45% were observed
with compounds 4 and 5, respectively (Figure S4). In general, a gel content of over
80% is considered as a sufficiently high cross-linked network when
equal molar ratios of the reactive component are used.20 A higher cross-linking density indicates that
more components are covalently attached in the cross-linked network.
Hence, we have duly proceeded with the gels synthesized with compound 3, and a decrease in the cross-linking density was observed
with an increase in the PEG chain length in the network.

FT-IR
Analysis
The formation of the gels was confirmed
by FT-IR analysis (Figure 3a), where the S–H stretching frequency at 2520 cm–1 from the PETMP diminished after gel formation, indicating
a successful thiol–norbornene click reaction.

Rheological
Measurements
The viscoelastic properties
of the as-synthesized gels were evaluated by rheological measurements
at room temperature. To begin with, the storage modulus (G′) and loss modulus (G″) of the three
gels were investigated by strain sweep measurement to figure out the
linear viscoelastic region (Figure S5).
The typical viscoelastic behavior was observed within the strain range
of 28–55% at a constant angular frequency of 0.1 rad/s. Therefore,
the frequency sweep experiments were carried out at a constant strain
of 1%, which is much below the deformation limit of the gels. From
the results (Figure 4a), it is evident that regardless of the PEG molecular weight, the
storage modulus (G′) is larger than the loss
modulus (G″), thereby suggesting the presence
of elasticity in the networks.21 The absence
of a crossover point in the given frequency region indicated a high
cross-linking density, leading to materials with high relaxation times.22 It was also very fascinating to note from the
results that both storage and loss moduli of the gels decreased with
an increase in the PEG molecular weight. We believe that with an increase
in the PEG molecular weight of the material, the entanglement degree
gets significantly reduced, and as a result, it gets easier for the
polymer chains to move under shear stress.22,23 This in turn gets reflected in the drop of loss modulus with an
increment in the PEG chain length. Further, the incorporation of PEG
into the network has led to lowering of the cross-linking density,
leading to higher flexibility of the materials. Hence, there was a
fall in the storage modulus with the increase in the PEG molecular
weight.22

Analysis of Pores
Surface visualization
was carried
out by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The SEM analysis as shown
in Figure S6 revealed that the materials
consist of macropores (2–4 μm) as well as pores with
a smaller size. For a better visualization of the pores, transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of the synthesized gels was also
carried out using an ultramicrotome (Figure S7). Due to the presence of larger pores in the surface as revealed
by the SEM and TEM analyses, the widely used nitrogen adsorption–desorption
technique could not be applied to measure the pore size of the as-synthesized
gels.24 For these kinds of materials, mercury
intrusion porosimetry (MIP) is known to provide more accurate and
precise information of the pores due to its ability to resolve pores
of a wide scale of diameters ranging from few nanometers to even micrometers.25,26 Therefore, the pore size of G1 was evaluated by MIP (Figure S8) and pores of varying sizes (3–30
μm) were found to be distributed in the material. We believe
that the presence of such large macropores in the network may be arising
from the higher degree of intermolecular cross-linking in the material.27

Swelling Ability and Correlation between
Solvent Uptake and
Solubility Parameter
The porous network as observed from
SEM, TEM, and MIP analyses motivated us to investigate the solvent
uptake ability of the synthesized gels at room temperature. For that
purpose, various solvents were chosen with a broad spectrum of polarities,
such as 1,4-dioxane (dielectric constant, ε = 2.25, nonpolar),
tetrahydrofuran (ε = 7.58, polar aprotic), dichloromethane (ε
= 8.93, polar aprotic), dimethyl formamide (ε = 36.71, polar
aprotic), dimethyl sulfoxide (ε = 46.68, polar aprotic), and
water (ε = 80.1, polar protic). The influence of the PEG chain
length on the swelling capacity of the network was estimated, and
the results are shown in Figure 4b.

To explain the swelling behavior of the as-prepared
gels in different solvents, the solubility parameter of the gel (δgel) was determined and compared to the corresponding values
of different solvents. In general, the solubility parameter of gels
is a fundamental thermodynamic property that directs the miscibility
of the gels or polymers in various solvents. Hansen defined the solubility
parameter (δ) by the following equation28 1  where δd2 is related to the dispersion
interaction,
δp2 is
related to the dipolar interaction, and δh2 is related to the hydrogen-bonding
interaction. Generally, solubility follows the rule “like dissolves
like”. The gels will swell maximum in the solvent whose solvent
parameter is close to that of the gel. To find the correlation between
the swelling ability of the gels and the solubility parameter, we
have used the Hansen solubility parameter of different solvents from
the existing literature.29 In most of the
literature reports, the % of swelling is calculated using eq S1.21,30,31 However, Haga et al. reported that the more precise approach is
to include solvent densities in the measurement of the swelling ratio.32 Thus, the swelling ratio was computed taking
the solvent densities into account (see the Experimental
Section).

To determine the solubility parameter of the
gels, the swelling
ratio of the synthesized gels in various solvents was first plotted
with respect to the solubility parameter of the solvents (Figure S9). Fitting this plot with a Gaussian
function revealed that the peak maxima of G1, G2, and G3 are at 14.77,
12.58, and 12.94 (cal cm–3)1/2, respectively
(Table S1). Deen et al. reported that this
peak maxima value is a reasonable approximation of the solubility
parameter of polymeric gels.28 In our case
also, this was found to be true as G3 was found to swell maximum in
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) having a solubility parameter of 13.03 (cal
cm–3)1/2 compared to the other two gels
due to the maximum proximity of the corresponding solubility parameters.
Further, as the solubility parameter of G2 was found to be an intermediate
of the solubility parameters of DMSO [13.03 (cal cm–3)1/2] and dimethylformamide (DMF) [12.14 (cal cm–3)1/2], the swelling ratio of G2 in the two solvents was
relatively close compared to that observed for G3. All of these clearly
suggest the interpretation in terms of solubility parameter to be
the superior approach for explaining the observed swelling behavior
of the gels in different solvents. Besides, the swelling ability of
a gel in a given solvent is often governed by polarity of the medium,
cross-linking density of the gel, etc.30 Thus, the results (Figure 4b) can also be explained in terms of solvent polarity. The
results indicated that irrespective of the PEG chain length, the gels
swelled preferably in polar aprotic solvents compared to nonpolar
and polar protic solvent. Moreover, for polar aprotic solvents, the
swelling of the gels was found to increase with an increase in dielectric
constants. Such a parallel relationship between the solvent uptake
and dielectric constants of the solvent can be attributed to the stabilization
via Coulombic interactions by the polar groups such as C=O
and poly(ethylene glycol) present in the cross-linked network. Further,
the relatively less swelling in the polar protic solvent indicates
that dielectric constants of the solvents are not the only decisive
aspect behind the swelling capacity. The rationale behind this can
be ascribed to the absence of any exchangeable ionic groups that favor
stabilization in polar protic solvents.14 Haga et al. reported that the swelling of polymer networks in a
given solvent can follow two different mechanisms. To understand the
mechanism of swelling of the as-synthesized gels in water, we plotted Qt/Q∞ vs time
(Figure S10), where Qt is the swelling ratio calculated from eq 8 and Q∞ is the equilibrium value of Qt. We observed
that initially there is a sharp increase in the swelling ability that
thereafter reaches a plateau. This kind of behavior indicates that
both “Fickian” and “case II” mechanisms
govern the swelling property of the gels.32

Furthermore, it is noteworthy from the results that the solvent
uptake ability of the gels increased with an increase in the PEG chain
length for all of the solvents. Such dependence of swelling on the
length of the PEG chain can be attributed to the cross-linking density
of the network. Rheological measurements have revealed that the storage
modulus that reflects the stiffness of the gels decreased with an
increase in the PEG chain length due to a lower cross-linking density.21 Such a decrease in the cross-linking density
with an increase in the PEG chain length helps in the swelling of
the corresponding gel compared to relatively stiff gels consisting
of smaller PEG chains. These observations clearly indicate that by
adjusting the PEG molecular weight, the swelling ability of the cross-linked
networks can be fine-tuned.

Thermal Stability
Thermal stability
is one of the vital
properties of gels as it dictates the practical usefulness of these
systems. The material that is to be applied for toxicant removal from
contaminated water must be able to withstand a high temperature to
prevent degradation below the temperature of wastewater. Thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) of the three gels was carried out at a ramping rate
of 10 °C/min (Figure 5a). The TGA showed a single-step degradation pattern. But
the first derivative plot (DTG) revealed that the degradation temperature
increased from 350 to 390 °C on going from G1 to G3. As all other
components (cross-linker, photoinitiator) are similar in the three
gels, different PEG chains contribute to the increase in the thermal
stability. To probe this fact, we have carried out TGA of each PEG
chain. The TG curve is provided in Figure S11, which displays that the degradation of PEG starts at 177, 204,
and 216 °C for the molecular weights of 600, 1450, and 4000,
respectively. Since the thermal stability of the PEG itself increases
with an increase in the chain length, the isolated gels also follow
the same trend. This observation indicates that the thermal stability
of the material can be regulated by adjusting the PEG chain length.

Figure 5 (a) TGA
and (b) DTG analyses of G1, G2, and G3 at the heating rate
of 10 °C/min.

To probe the influence
of the PEG molecular weight or cross-linking
density of the network on the melting and crystallization behavior,
differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis of the synthesized
gels was carried out. The cross-linking density of the material plays
a crucial role in tuning the thermal properties.33−35 The DSC curves
(heating and cooling cycles) are presented in Figure 6. Analysis of the cooling curves (Figure 6b) reveals that the
gel with a longer PEG chain length tends to form a crystalline phase
in the network. Such crystallization behavior in the case of G3 can
be credited to the favorable geometrical alignment in the network.35 The melting endotherms of the gels are displayed
in Figure 6a. The results
exhibited an interesting melting behavior of the gels. The melting
curves of each PEG, provided in Figure S12, show that Tm increases with an increase
in the PEG chain length. Now, if we compare between PEG 600 and G1,
G1 showed a broad endotherm around 59 °C due to the sustained
melting of the gel. This could be attributed to the efficient cross-linking
(the highest gel content observed in this case, Figure 3b) and enhanced miscibility with the homogeneous
phase between the norbornene cross-linker and the shorter PEG chain,
which in turn reflected in the absence of any sharp Tc during the cooling cycle. On the other hand, G2 showed
no such endotherm in the experimental temperature range, which might
be resulting from some unusual packing of the constituents. Notably,
G3 exhibited a clear and sharp melting endotherm having the maximum
around 47 °C. Such reduction in Tm in the case of G3 might be due to the incorporation of a high-molecular-weight
PEG moiety into the cross-linked network resulting from the increase
in chain mobility due to the relatively less cross-linking density.
It could also be ascribed to the crystal size reduction leading to
the change in the surface free energy with the increase in the molecular
weight of the PEG.35 The decrease in Tm led to the enhanced chain mobility of the
gel (G3), which was corroborated with its reduced storage modulus
(Figure 4a) and increased
crystallinity36 of the same as observed
in this study. Hence, the flow of the influence of the PEG chain length
on the thermal property is as follows: high cross-linking density
(with shorter PEG chain) → chain mobility is restricted →
higher Tm; reduced cross-linking density
(with longer PEG chain) → increased chain mobility →
lowering of Tm.

Dye Removal
Adsorption Kinetics
After evaluating
the outcome of
varied PEG molecular weights on the physical properties of the cross-linked
network, its effect toward dye removal from aqueous solutions was
explored. For that, rhodamine B was chosen as the model cationic dye.
Then, 20 mg of the respective gels was dipped in aqueous solutions
of 0.1 mM rhodamine B and the dye removal process was probed by monitoring
time-dependent UV–vis spectra of the dye solutions. To fathom
the mechanism which directs the dye removal process, the data obtained
from the kinetic experiments were fitted into pseudo-first-order (eq 2), pseudo-second-order
(eq 3), and Weber–Morris
intraparticle diffusion (eq 4) models.37,38 These models were validated by
analyzing their corresponding correlation coefficients (R2). 2   3   4  where qt and qe are the amounts of the
dye removed at time t and at equilibrium, respectively, k1 (h–1) is the pseudo-first-order
rate constant, k2 (g mg–1 h–1) is the rate constant for the pseudo-second-order
model, and ki is the
intraparticle diffusion rate constant. The slopes and intercepts of
the linear plots of log(qe – qt) vs t for the pseudo-first-order
kinetics,  vs t for the
pseudo-second-order
kinetics, and qt vs t1/2 for intraparticle diffusion model were employed to
find the parameters.

The results obtained are depicted in Figures 7–9 and Table 1. The high degree of linearity in the case
of pseudo-second-order kinetic models described the dye removal kinetics
better than the pseudo-first-order model for all of the three gel
systems. This suggested that the dye adsorption by the gel may be
resulting from some kind of chemical interaction.39 At this initial concentration, the qe value was found to increase on going from G1 to G3. For the
intraparticle diffusion models, there were two successive linear portions.
The first linear part being steeper than the later one indicated the
diffusion of the dyes from the bulk solution to the boundary layer
of the gel or across the boundary layer to the surface of the gel.37 The second linearity demonstrated intraparticle
diffusion as the rate-determining step. But the lines did not pass
through the origin (intercept, c ≠ 0), thereby
signifying that the intraparticle diffusion mechanism, although involved
in the adsorption process, is not the only rate-limiting step for
dye removal.38

On the other hand, when the dye removal efficiency
was investigated
with an anionic dye Acid Orange 7, only negligible removal took place
even after 5 days (Figure S7). These results
indicated that the materials are efficient toward the removal of cationic
dyes but incompetent for the anionic dye removal. We believe that
the presence of electron-rich groups in the cross-linked networks
is responsible for such specificity toward cationic dyes over anionic
ones.

Adsorption Isotherms
To appraise
the adsorption type,
the experimentally obtained data were fitted into two adsorption isotherm
models, namely, Langmuir and Freundlich models.37 The Langmuir model that assumes monolayer adsorption of
the adsorbate onto the adsorbent can be expressed as the following
equation 5  where ce is the
equilibrium concentration of the dye in mg L–1, qe is the amount of the dye removed by the gel
in mg g–1, qm is the
monolayer adsorption capacity of the adsorbent in mg g–1, and b is the Langmuir constant. The Langmuir isotherm
can also be formulated in terms of the following dimensionless parameter 6  where c0 denotes
the initial dye concentration in mg L–1 and the RL value defines the adsorption type. Adsorption
is irreversible for RL = 0, linear for RL = 1, unfavorable for RL > 1, and favorable if 0 < RL < 1.

The Freundlich model is based on the assumption of
adsorption on the heterogeneous surface and is expressed as 7  where n is the Freundlich
constant and kf is the constant associated
with the adsorption capacity, and they can be calculated from the
plot of ln qe versus ln ce.

The results of Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms
are presented
in Figures 10–12 and Table 2. The correlation coefficients for Langmuir
isotherm models were found to be higher than those for Freundlich
isotherm models for the three gels, thereby implying better applicability
of the Langmuir model with the RL value
lying between 0 and 1.38 This suggested
that though the incorporation of PEG with different molecular weights
in the as-synthesized gels does not alter the adsorption type or adsorption
mechanism, it has a significant effect on the maximum adsorption capacity
(qm = 28.9 mg g–1 for
G1 to 66.7 mg g–1 for G3). We believe that the improvement
of dye adsorption capacity with an increase in the PEG chain length
is arising from the increasing swelling capacity of the gels. As higher
swelling indicates the incorporation of a higher amount of solvent
in the cross-linked networks, the interaction between the dye molecules
and the gel gets enhanced, leading to higher adsorption.

Effect of Initial Dye Concentration
As depicted in Figure 13, it is evident
that with an increase in the initial dye concentration from 0.479
to 479 mg/L, there is enhancement of the maximum removal capacity
(qm) of the gels. It is also noteworthy
to observe that the qe value increased
with an increase in the PEG chain length. This result emphasizes that
the initial dye concentration and the PEG chain length are two major
aspects for the determination of the dye removal efficiency as long
as all other parameters are constant. At low dye concentrations, the
active sites provided by the gels are not saturated, resulting in
lower qe values for the three gels. The qe values increased up to a certain point, and
thereafter, no significant change was observed. This critical point
is the saturation limit of the active adsorption sites present in
the gels.40 The maximum adsorption capacity
(qm) was achieved when all of the adsorption
sites were saturated. With an increase in the PEG chain length in
the cross-linked network, the availability of the interaction sites
with the dye molecules also increased. This triggered the increment
in the maximum adsorption capacity of the gel with increasing PEG
chain length. This result underlines the influence of the PEG chain
length on the adsorption capability of the network.

of rhodamine B on G1, G2, and G3.

For practical application, reusability of the gels is a crucial
parameter. Ethanol was found to be an efficient solvent for desorption
of rhodamine B from gels. The recyclability was checked by measuring
the UV–vis spectra of the dye solution, and the removal efficiency
was determined using eq S1.41Figure 14 reveals that the removal efficiency is 73% even after the
seventh cycle. Such fair recyclability of the material can be credited
to the porous cross-linked network structure that enables both adsorption
of dyes from aqueous solutions and the subsequent desorption in ethanolic
solution.

Conclusions
To summarize, this work
depicts the facile synthesis of chemical
adsorbents based on thiol–norbornene photoclick reactions.
The influence of the PEG chain length in this cross-linked network
on various physical properties as well as dye removal capacities were
thoroughly evaluated for the first time. The gel content of all of
the synthesized gels was >80%, which indicates a fairly high cross-linking
density. The cross-linking density of the gels was found to decrease
with an increase in the PEG chain length in the given condition where
the molar ratios of the total norbornene and thiol were equal. All
of the synthesized gels (G1, G2, and G3) exhibited excellent swelling
in organic solvents, in particular polar aprotic solvents, and the
swelling ability was found to improve with an increment in the PEG
chain length. Rheological measurements revealed the tendency of longer
PEG chains to form a more flexible network due to a decrease in the
cross-linking density. The thermal stability of the network was found
to improve with increasing length of PEG chains. DSC studies described
the formation of the crystalline phase in the network with a higher
PEG molecular weight. It also indicated the influence of the cross-linking
density on the thermal properties of the material, mainly on Tm. SEM, TEM, as well as MIP analyses well established
the presence of macropores across the cross-linked material. The gels
served as efficient adsorbents to remove the toxic cationic dye rhodamine
B from water. The adsorption results were in a good agreement with
the pseudo-second-order kinetic models as well as the Langmuir adsorption
isotherm models, and an enhancement in the adsorption capacity was
observed with an increase in the PEG chain length in the network.
This report yields a physical insight regarding the role of PEG behind
the physical properties and the dye removal capability of the network.
Conclusively, this report will pave the way for the development of
a new class of robust adsorbents based on thiol–norbornene
cross-linked network owing to their biocompatibility, ease of synthesis,
flexibility, thermal stability, and recyclability.

Synthesis
of PEG Precursors: 4, 5,
and 6
The Mitsunobu coupling reaction was employed
between norbornene carboxylic acid (mixture of exo and endo) and PEG
600, PEG 1450, and PEG 4000 individually to obtain macromonomers 4, 5, and 6, respectively. Initially,
PEG 600 (5 g, 8.33 mmol) was dissolved in dry tetrahydrofuran (THF)
after heating for 2 h at 120 °C. To that solution, norbornene
carboxylic acid (6.97 g, 50.47 mmol) and PPh3 (13.24 g,
50.47 mmol) were added. This solution was then brought at 0 °C,
followed by the dropwise addition of DIAD (10.20 g, 50.47 mmol) dissolved
in anhydrous THF. The resulting mixture was then brought to room temperature
and continuously stirred for 48 h under nitrogen atmosphere. Thereafter,
the reaction mixture was concentrated and purified by column chromatography
(ethyl acetate/hexane) to obtain a yellow viscous liquid. For 5 and 6, the concentrated solution was precipitated
in cold diethyl ether three times and collected by centrifugation. 1H NMR of compound 4 (CDCl3, 500 MHz)

Synthesis
of the Gel
Compound 3 was dissolved
in DCM solutions containing either compound 4, or 5, or 6. PETMP (equal molar ratio of the thiol
to total norbornene component), the photoinitiator (2-hydroxy-4′-(2-hydroxyethoxy)-2-methylpropiophenone)
was then added to it, and the solutions were cured under UV light
for ∼30 min. The formation of the gel was initially confirmed
by the vial inversion method. Then, the gels were washed with DCM
repetitively to remove any unreacted monomer, cross-linker, or photoinitiator,
followed by drying under vacuum. For the ease of understanding, the
gels synthesized with compounds 4, 5, and 6 are denoted as G1, G2, and G3, respectively, in the future
discussion. The schematic representation of the thiol–norbornene
photo-cross-linked reaction mechanism is illustrated in Supporting
Information (Figure S14).

Determination
of Gel Content
During the purification
process of the gels, a specific amount of the material (mass M1) was immersed in DCM and kept overnight to
allow any un-cross-linked components to diffuse out to the solvent
from the cross-linked network. After that, the swollen gels were dried
in vacuum and weighed again to get mass M2. The % of gel content was measured from the ratio of the gel before
and after extraction (M1/M2).19 This process was carried
out in triplicate for each of the gels to obtain the correct gel content
value.

Solvent Uptake Analysis
The ability of the cross-linked
networks to uptake different solvents was measured by the gravimetric
method. For that purpose, a measured amount of the dried gel was taken
in a vial, to which various solvents of different polarities were
added. The vial was kept undisturbed for 24 h for the gel to reach
the maximum swelling capacity. Thereafter, the gels were taken out
from the solvents and wiped carefully with tissue paper before weighing.
The percentage (%) of swelling (Qt) or
the swelling ratio was calculated using the following formula21 8  where ws and wd are the
masses of swollen and dry gels, respectively, dsolv is the solvent density, and dgel is the density of the cross-linked network, which
is taken as unity in all of the three cases owing to its difficulty
in determination.

Dye Removal Studies
The influence
of the PEG molecular
weight in the cross-linked network on its dye removal capability (rhodamine
B) was tested by spectroscopic methods. For the kinetic studies, 20
mg of each gel was added to 0.1 mM rhodamine B solution (4 mL, prepared
in deionized water, pH = 6.89 and at room temperature) and the removal
of the dye was probed by change of intensity in the UV–vis
spectra as the absorbance was found to decrease with increase in time.
Each experiment was carried out in triplicate. The concentration of
the removed dye was measured from the appropriate calibration curve.
For the isotherm studies, 20 mg of each gel was added to dye solutions
of various concentrations (from 0.479 to 479 mg/mL) and the decrease
in absorbance after 48 h was recorded. The amount of the dye removed
by unit weight of the gel (qe, mg/g) was
acquired using the following formula37 9  where C0 and Ce are the concentrations of the dye solution
in mg/L at the initial stage and at equilibrium, respectively, m is the mass of the gel in g, and V stands
for the volume of the dye solution in liters.
