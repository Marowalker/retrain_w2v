Antimicrobial
peptides (AMPs) are currently known for their potential
as an alternative to conventional antibiotics and new weapons against
drug-resistant bacteria and biofilms. In the present work, the mechanism
of action of a cyclic (colistin) and a linear (catestatin) AMP on
a young E. coli biofilm was deciphered
from the molecular to the cellular scale. To this end, infrared spectroscopy
(attenuated total reflection–Fourier transform infrared) assisted
by chemometric analysis was combined with fluorescence and atomic
force microscopies to address the very different behaviors of both
AMPs. Indeed, the colistin dramatically damaged the bacterial cell
wall and the metabolism even though its action was not homogeneous
over the whole bacterial population and repopulation can be observed
after peptide removal. Conversely, catestatin did not lead to major
damages in the bacterial morphology but its action was homogeneous
over the whole bacterial population and the cells were unable to regrow
after the peptide treatment. Our results strongly suggested that contrary
to the cyclic molecule, the linear one is able to cause irreversible
damages in the bacterial membrane concomitantly to a strong impact
on the bacterial metabolism.

1 Introduction
In the past decades, overconsumption
of antibiotics associated
with fast bacterial growth and strong facility to adapt to external
constraints has resulted in an important emergence of multidrug-resistant
bacteria. Among the multidrug-resistant microorganisms,
the case of pathogenic bacteria is a global emergency and the design
of new antimicrobial treatments and molecules with chemical characteristics
different from those of current antibiotics represents an urgent issue.1−4 Besides, the treatment of bacterial infections has become very challenging,
notably when pathogenic bacteria are organized in a biofilm. The biofilm
is a three-dimensional assembly of microorganisms embedded in a self-produced
exopolymeric matrix attached on biological or abiotic surfaces.5 Several studies highlighted that conventional
antibiotic’s effectiveness against planktonic bacteria can
be totally inefficient against sessile cells mainly because microbial
biofilms are intrinsically much more resistant to antibiotics.6−8 The reduced biocide susceptibility of bacteria in biofilms can originate
from delayed penetration of the antimicrobial, an alteration of the
cellular growth rate in the biofilm, from adaptive responses (repression
or induction of genes), and the occurrence of persisters even in young
biofilms. The design of alternative strategies to conventional antibiotics
is of major importance particularly for a more efficient anti-biofilm
treatment.

In this context, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are
considered as
an alternative to conventional antibiotics and potentially a more
efficient weapon against bacteria and biofilms mainly because they
are less susceptible to give rise to bacterial drug-resistance due
to their nonspecific action toward bacteria.9−12 AMPs are short biomolecules exhibiting
various structures and physicochemical properties. AMPs are generally
composed of less than 100 amino acid residues, and their primary structure
can be either linear or cyclic.13 AMPs
can be classified in four families according to their secondary structures,
including α-helices, β-sheets, mixed structures, and linear
or extended secondary structure.9,14 AMPs are often amphipathic
(i.e., containing both hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains) and are
often positively charged.9,14,15 Most AMPs act first by electrostatic interactions with the negatively
charged bacterial cell wall.16 After this
first step, accumulation and conformational changes that occur at
the bacterial interface are followed generally by the membrane disruption.
Besides, the activity of AMPs can also disturb and interfere in metabolic
and intracellular processes, leading to inhibition of cell wall, nucleic
acid, or protein biosynthesis.17,18 Usually, linear and
short AMPs are nonstructured in water and they adopt a secondary structure
only upon interaction with the membrane.19 Converse to linear AMPs, some cyclic AMPs are able to adopt a specific
structure even in water.20 Moreover, previous
studies evidenced that the cyclic molecules are amongst the most effective
antimicrobial agents.13,21 If the AMPs also include either
nonnatural amino acids or alkyl chains in their primary structure,
they gain a broader antibacterial activity.22,23

Catestatin is a linear peptide composed of 21 amino acids
and exhibits
antimicrobial activity against a wide array of pathogens.24 This peptide is a fragment of chromogranin A
and is well known for stimulating the immune system cells and for
its nontoxicity to mammalian cells.25,26 Catestatin
has been shown to have strong antimicrobial activity also in multifunctional
coatings on titanium implants.27 Colistin,
a cyclic decapeptide linked to a fatty acid chain, belonging to the
polymyxin family, is known for its antimicrobial action against multidrug-resistant
bacteria.28,29 Colistin is highly efficient on Gram-negative
bacteria, but its use is hampered by its nephro- and neurotoxicity (Table 1).30

In the present work, we compare the antimicrobial
activity of cyclic
colistin and linear catestatin on a young E. coli biofilm to investigate the influence of the structure on their activity
and mechanism of action. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) assisted by Bayesian positive source
separation (BPSS) chemometric analysis, atomic force microscopy (AFM),
and epifluorescence microscopy were combined to monitor in situ and
in real time the action of both peptides. ATR-FTIR allows the investigation
of metabolic and biochemical changes within the biofilm, whereas AFM
was used to visualize the local effects of the antimicrobial peptide
upon cell morphology and mechanical properties. In addition, the bacterial
membrane integrity was tested by staining of the biofilms with the BacLight kit.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 E. coli Biofilm
before the Peptide Treatment
Figure 1a illustrates the evolution of the ATR-FTIR
spectra during the initial steps of biofilm formation in the fingerprint
region. The infrared band assignments were made according to the literature31−35 and are gathered in Table 2. The amide I and II bands from proteins are located at 1648
and 1548 cm–1, respectively. The region 1340–1190
cm–1 is assigned to the antisymmetric stretching
of the phosphate groups of nucleic acids and phospholipids as well
as the amide III band of proteins. Finally, a large massif is observed
in the region 1160–950 cm–1, which is attributed
to the vibrational modes of polysaccharides as well as to the symmetric
stretching of the phosphate groups of phospholipids and nucleic acids.
The intensities of the whole bacterial ATR-FTIR fingerprint increased,
reflecting the attachment and colonization of bacteria onto the Ge
crystal. Furthermore, the intensities of the bands associated to nucleic
acids and polysaccharides (between 1160 and 950 cm–1) increased at a higher rate than those of the amide II band (at
1547 cm–1) during the flow of sterile LB/10 from 2.5 to
5.5 h and corresponded to a high metabolic activity for bacterial
cell division and biofilm growth. The 5.5 h old biofilm was mostly
composed of a bacterial monolayer, including some bacterial clusters,
as observed by epifluorescence microscopy (Figure 2a,b), with an average surface coverage of
40 ± 11%. The bacteria stained with the BacLight
kit were green (Figure 2b), suggesting that their membranes were intact. The bacteria had
an average length of 2.9 ± 0.9 μm and a diameter of 0.9
± 0.1 μm (calculated from at least 10 randomly selected
individual bacteria).

A closer
look on the bacterial morphology on the nanoscale was
carried out by AFM imaging (Figure 3). This small region of 5 × 5 μm2 surface area was almost totally covered by rod-shaped bacteria.
Cells exhibited an average length of about 2.3 ± 0.6 μm
for a width of 0.8 ± 0.1 μm (Table 3), in accordance with epifluorescence images.
The height profiles (Figure 3c) showed depth variations of about 300–700 nm, corresponding
to the bacterial height after slight dehydration. The estimated average
height of the bacterial cells was thus 303 ± 44 nm (see Table 3). Such values are
generally measured when bacteria lose partly their intracellular cytosol.36

2.2 E. coli Biofilm
Development without Peptide Treatment (Control Experiment)
The 5.5 h old biofilm was exposed for 24 h to sterile LB/10 medium
in a closed circuit. Figure 1b shows the ATR-FTIR spectra recorded during 24 h closed circulation
of LB/10 medium. During the first 2.5 h of LB/10 flow, characteristic
spectra of bacteria were recorded.31 The
intensities of these infrared bands increased, suggesting bacterial
growth on the crystal. After this period, the amide band intensities
remained stable without significant changes in the band shape. After
6 h of LB/10 flow, bands assigned to nucleic acids at 1237, 1219,
and 1086 cm–1 started to decrease and bands at 1155,
1080, and 1026 cm–1 started to increase. The latter
bands were assigned to glycogen.37 Glycogen
is a storage compound, and it is generally biosynthesized when nutritive
compounds such as nitrogen and/or phosphorus are lacking and carbon
is in excess.38 As the LB/10 circulation
was closed, no continuous flow of fresh nutrients was available for
the bacteria, leading to impoverishment of the growth medium in some
nutrients. The BPSS procedure of curve resolution was used to help
the interpretation of the spectra that had overlapped regions and
smooth continuous spectral evolutions.37 Three pure component spectra, which explained 96% of the total spectral
variation of the spectra set, were extracted. The percentage of nonreconstructed
data was mainly noise, and represented only 4% of the total spectral
variation of the spectra set. The extracted pure spectra reflect the
main components to be varying with a significant statistical variance
during the biofilm development and give a time-dependent image of
the physiological changes occurring in the sessile bacteria. Spectra
of pure components SP1ctrl, SP2ctrl, and SP3ctrl (Figure 1c) have the general spectral
features of nucleic acids, proteins, and glycogen, with probably phospholipids
(bands at 1735 and 1213 cm–1), respectively.39,40 The assignment of these pure component spectra allowed tracing the
concentrations of the corresponding biomolecules during the biofilm
development. Figure 1d shows the relative concentration profiles calculated by the BPSS
analysis. The estimated relative concentrations of each pure component
spectrum showed different time evolutions. The relative concentration
C1ctrl and C2ctrl of pure components PS1ctrl and PS2ctrl, respectively,
increased together during the first 4 h of LB/10 flow. The sum of
both spectra represented very well the spectral feature of bacteria
and suggested the growth of bacteria on the crystal surface. The quite
stable quantity of protein after 6 h of the LB/10 flow suggested a
quite stable bacterial population in direct contact with the crystal.
Some spatial reorganization between 10 and 12 h and after 24 h of
LB/10 flow can be suggested from the small fluctuations of C2ctrl
(Figure 1d). The nucleic
acid component decreased after 4 h of LB/10 flow (SP1ctrl and C1ctrl, Figure 1d) and finally was
canceled after 24 h (i.e., it fell at about the same level as the one for
the 5.5 h old biofilm). This showed that the bacteria at the bottom
of the biofilm gradually decreased their metabolic activity as a function
of time. The biosynthesis of glycogen began as soon as 3 h of the
LB/10 flow. The quantity of synthetized glycogen increased continuously
over 10 h (SP3ctrl and C3ctrl, Figure 1c,d) and then slightly decreased until reaching a plateau
value between 13 and 24 h of LB/10 flow. After 13 h, the quantity
of the glycogen stayed constant and it was concomitant to the end
of nucleic acid synthesis. The end of the synthesis and degradation
of the ARN were probably associated with the ageing of the bacteria
that grew slowly or that stopped growing and stopped the biosynthesis
of glycogen within about 1 μm over the Ge crystal, as this feature
was already observed in sessile bacteria of P. fluorescens.37Figure 2c,d illustrates the epifluorescence images of the control
biofilm. The bacteria were mainly arranged in a monolayer on the surface
with multilayered bacteria at some places, and the average coverage
was estimated to be 71 ± 19%. The bacteria stained with the BacLight kit were green, indicating intact cell membranes.
The average length of bacteria in the 29.5 h old biofilm was significantly
smaller than that of bacteria in the 5.5 h old biofilm. It was estimated
to be 1.8 ± 0.4 μm, whereas the width only slightly changed
(Table 4), suggesting
that the bacteria probably adapted their growth to the current microenvironment.41

2.3 E. coli Biofilm
Treated with Colistin
The minimal inhibitory concentration
(MIC) of colistin for planktonic E. coli was estimated at 0.87 μM. This concentration is below the
concentration at which colistin form aggregates.42Figure 4a shows the ATR-FTIR spectral evolution during 24 h of colistin exposure
at 0.87 μM. An increase of the amide I and II bands intensities
at 1647 and 1547 cm–1, respectively, during the
first 9 h was observed. The spectra also showed a slight increase
of the bands assigned to nucleic acids at 1240, 1222, 1118, and 1064
cm–1 during the first 2 h of colistin circulation.
Then, they decreased after 4 h of circulation, reflecting a decrease
in nucleic acid production and thus the drop in metabolic activity,36 also illustrated by a very weak production of
glycogen (Figure 4a,
weak bands at 1055 and 1024 cm–1). The BPSS procedure
resolved three pure component spectra (Figure 5a), which explained 97% of the total spectral
variation of the spectra set. SP1col had the general spectral features
of nucleic acids, SP2col had the general spectral features of nucleic
acids (negative bands) and of glycogen (positive bands), and SP3col
had the spectral features of proteins.39,40Figure 5b shows the relative concentration
profiles calculated by the BPSS analysis. The estimated relative concentrations
C1col and C2col of SP1col and SP2col, respectively, showed the decrease
of the nucleic acid biosynthesis, as soon as 2 h of colistin treatment.
However, a weak biosynthesis of glycogen was maintained. The colistin
treatment of the young biofilm changed drastically the bacterial metabolism,
but some of the processes observed in the control biofilm were poorly
maintained. C3col of SP3col, which represented the protein variation
in the young biofilm, increased during 8 h and then slightly decreased
nonmonotonously. This feature was mainly assigned to the increase
of the number of bacteria on the surface. The possible accumulation
of colistin cannot be clearly evidenced because its initial concentration
was too low. This conclusion was supported by the epifluorescence
images recorded after 24 h of colistin treatment. Representative fluorescence
images of biofilms after incubation with colistin are presented in Figure 2e,f. The bacteria
within the 29.5 h old biofilm exhibited a very weak self-fluorescence
presumably due to a very low GFP production. Because of the poor contrast
of the images, it was not possible to calculate an accurate average
ratio of the coverage. However, this coverage ratio was qualitatively
higher than that for the 5.5 h old biofilm. These results were in
accordance with the infrared spectra that suggested a weaker bacterial
metabolic activity that however did not cancel the growth of bacteria
on the Ge crystal. The images of the biofilm stained with the BacLight kit showed a heterogeneous population of bacteria
composed of a large amount of damaged bacteria (orange/red), some
bacteria with nondamaged membranes (green), and cell fragments (dark
green blurred background in Figure 2f). In addition, dramatic changes in the morphology
with coccoid-shaped and smaller bacteria of ∼1.6 μm length
with ∼0.7 μm diameter were observed (Table 4). This result was in accordance
with the findings of Soon et al. who reported colistin-susceptible Acinetobacter baumannii to adopt a rod-shaped morphology.43 The occurrence of bacteria with nondamaged membranes
suggested that either the colistin concentration was not sufficient
to reach all of the bacteria in the biofilm or the cells might have
expressed a resistance/persistence already described.44,45

14, and 17 h of LB/10 flow for c, d).

treatment; (b, d) experiment with 24 h of catestatin treatment. Offsets

Figure 3d,e illustrates
the AFM images (height and deflection) and cross section (Figure 3f) obtained from
the 5.5 h old biofilm subjected to colistin at 0.87 μM for 24
h. They are very different from those recorded on the 5.5 h old biofilm
before the peptide treatment. The bacterial shape transition was also
observed with the occurrence of coccoid or spherical cells of about
1.6 ± 0.2 μm (Table 3). These data confirmed that bacterial cell walls were strongly
damaged in the presence of colistin. The cross sections (Figure 3f) showed a dramatic
decrease of the bacterial thickness, with values of about 50–150
nm instead of 350–450 nm before the treatment (Table 3). This result underlined that
the antimicrobial peptide should modify the bacterial membrane permeability
and consequently must have an impact on the mechanical properties
of the bacterial cell wall. Figure 6 shows typical force–indentation curves and
elasticity histograms recorded on the biofilm before and after the
colistin treatment. As evidenced in Figure 6a, the maximal indention depth measured at
an applied force of 4 nN on the representative force curves was about
280 and 130 nm for the nontreated and colistin-treated biofilm, respectively.
These elements indicated clearly an increase of the bacterial stiffness
when the latter was exposed to colistin. Such results are in line
with the BacLight assays and the differences in bacterial
morphology observed after the colistin treatment. The analysis of
the whole force curves recorded before and after the action of the
AMPs with the Sneddon model allowed us to calculate the stiffness
statistic distribution (Figure 6b). The nontreated biofilm yielded a pseudo Gaussian behavior
of the elastic modulus distribution, with an average value of 135
± 89 kPa. This value is in the same range as the one that has
been measured in the planktonic form in previous works.46 When the biofilm was treated with colistin,
the Gaussian behavior of the elastic modulus distribution was lost
and the latter became very wide, with an average value of 598 ±
277 kPa. An increase of cell rigidity has already been described upon
the colistin action on several bacterial strains.47−49 These works
highlighted that colistin dramatically impacted both bacterial turgor
pressure and cell wall stiffness even though the concentration was
lower than that of bacterial MIC. The authors explained such stiffening
in bacterial rigidity by both colistin accumulation at the outer membrane
until saturation of specific LPS binding sites and colistin association
with the peptidoglycan layer.49

2.4 E. coli Biofilm
Treated with Catestatin
The MIC of catestatin for planktonic E. coli was measured at 60 μM. This value was
in the range of those previously reported.26Figure 4b shows the
spectral evolution of the 5.5 h old biofilm recorded during 24 h of
exposure to catestatin at its MIC. The spectra were first dominated
by the amide bands at around 1640 and 1540 cm–1.
This spectral signature was composed of amide bands already observed
in the spectra of the reference biofilm. Additional amide bands appeared
progressively at 1624 and 1531 cm–1. The amide bands
appeared 2 h after the injection of catestatin, and they increased
throughout the course of the 24 h experiment. These bands were assigned
to catestatin that accumulated on the bacteria, and the corresponding
wavenumbers suggested a β-sheet conformation of the peptide.50−52 Amide I bands of only equal intensities were observed at 1657 and
1623 cm–1 for catestatin in water (Figure 4b). The occurrence of β-sheet
was already detected in water and in a more hydrophobic solvent in
other studies.53,54 Thus, catestatin was likely to
increase the β-sheet conformation probably by accumulation of
catestatin in the vicinity of the bacterial membrane. Such a phenomenon
has been reported by Jean-Francois et al. on a similar peptide, cateslytin,
in the presence of negatively charged bacterial mimetic membranes.55 The spectral profile in the region 1300–900
cm–1 changed with respect to the reference biofilm.
No typical bands of glycogen were observed, suggesting the inhibition
of glycogen production by the peptide treatment. All of these changes
indicated a dramatic change in bacterial metabolism. The BPSS procedure
resolved two pure component spectra, which explained 96% of the total
spectral variation of the spectra set (Figure 5b). SP1cat had the general spectral features
of bacteria. However, the band shape of the region 1300–950
cm–1 was deteriorated, suggesting a random structure
for the nucleic acids (probably RNA39).
SP2cat had the general spectral features of proteins.39,40 The Amide I band showed an enhanced band at 1621 cm–1 that was assigned to a β-sheet conformation. This band was
already present in the spectrum of catestatin in water (see inset
of Figure 5c), but
the estimated quantity of the β-sheet conformation increased
from about 45 to about 60% (from a decomposition procedure with Gaussian
bands and taking into account possible errors coming from a nonperfect
compensation of the water background). Figure 5d shows the relative concentration profiles
calculated by the BPSS analysis. The estimated relative concentration
C1cat of SP1cat increased until 7 h and then decreased slightly to
reach a pseudoplateau. Bacteria multiplied on the surface during 6
h, and the successive decrease of C1cat suggested a partial loss of
biomass after 7 h of the catestatin treatment. The estimated concentration
C2cat of SP2cat increased very quickly during 3 h, and then this concentration
was more or less stable for the rest of the experiment. The accumulation
of catestatin reached its maximal value, leading to the end of metabolic
activity and to a partial loss of biomass by detachment.

Figure 2i,j showed the epifluorescence
images of the biofilm after 24 h of catestatin treatment. The GFP
fluorescence was very weak (Figure 2i), suggesting an alteration of the bacterial metabolism.
The bacteria stained with the BacLight kit were homogeneously
orange/red throughout the surface, reflecting damaged membranes (Figure 2j). The bacterial
morphology was not impacted by the catestatin treatment. The rodlike
bacterial shape was maintained, and it was in accordance with AFM
images (Figure 3g–h).
The average length was 2.2 ± 0.3 μm for a width of 0.8
± 0.1 μm (Table 3). The cross sections (Figure 3i) indicated bacterial thickness of about 400 nm on
an average. This value remained similar to the value measured for
the nontreated biofilm. Holes were observed in the bacterial membranes
(arrows on Figure 3h). Therefore, it can be suggested that the mechanism of catestatin
action passes through a barrel stave or a toroidal pore mechanism.18 The maximal indention depth measured at an applied
force of 4 nN on the representative force curves was about 420 nm
for the catestatin-treated biofilm. This value was 1.5 times greater
than the one measured on the nontreated biofilm, reflecting softening
of the bacterial membranes. Figure 6b shows a Gaussian distribution of the elastic modulus,
with an average value of 48 ± 27 kPa, which was about 3 times
lower with respect to the nontreated biofilm. The decrease in bacterial
stiffness caused by AMPs derived from magainin was previously described
by da Silva et al.56

2.5 Is the Antimicrobial Peptide Action Irreversible
against Sessile Bacteria?
After the AMP treatments, the biofilms
were subjected to a fresh sterile nutritive medium to assess the efficiency
of the treatment. The ATR-FTIR spectral evolutions are shown in Figure 4c,d. Concerning the
biofilm treated with colistin, the spectra showed during 3 h (i) the
rapid increase of bands at 1240, 1219, 1122, and 1085 cm–1 assigned to nucleic acids, and (ii) a slight decrease of bands at
1646 and 1548 cm–1 assigned to Amide I and II of
proteins. This result suggested the high metabolic activity of intact
cells and the partial loss of biomass from the highly damaged bacteria,
respectively. After 3 h, all of the bands in the fingerprint region
progressively increased again. The whole bands were assigned to the
bacterial fingerprint, and this result suggested the bacterial repopulation
(Figure 4c). The intact
bacteria had recovered from the antimicrobial treatment. The epifluorescence
images showed a very high coverage of the Ge surface by bacteria (almost
100%, Figure 2g,h),
and multilayers of bacteria were observed. The bacteria had also recovered
their original size and shape with an average length of 1.9 ±
0.3 μm. On the contrary, for the biofilm treated with catestatin,
a strong decrease of the whole infrared signature was observed (Figure 4d). These spectral
fingerprints, typical of bacteria, suggested a strong loss of the
biomass from the surface of the Ge crystal. The bacteria therefore
could not survive the peptide treatment and detached from the surface,
and the peptide had an irreversible effect on the sessile bacteria.
The epifluorescence pictures were in good agreement with the infrared
results. They showed very few bacteria on the Ge surface after 17
h of flow of LB/10 (Figure 2k,l). Dark spots with undefined shapes after BacLight staining were also present and corresponded probably to cell
fragments.36 The time evolution of the
biofilm after the peptide treatments at the different MICs clearly
highlighted two different modes of action. Whereas some bacteria were
able to regrow and recolonize the crystal after the colistin treatment,
this was not the case for the catestatin treatment. Emphasizing that
both peptides have the same positive charge, the difference of activity
should come from their secondary structure. First, the cyclic peptide
with an acyl chain (colistin) was more destructive in terms of cell
integrity with respect to the linear peptide (catestatin), in accordance
with the literature.21,57 Second, the MIC of catestatin
was about 70 times higher than that of colistin but the bacterial
growth was stopped irreversibly. At the MIC, the number of colistin
molecules per bacteria was lower than that for catestatin, and therefore
it can be explained that the bacterial growth kept going on in the
presence of colistin. All of these elements underlined that excluding
the possible intrinsic resistance of the bacteria, treatments with
higher concentrations of colistin are necessary to determine the concentration
required to stop irreversibly the biofilm growth to reach the catestatin
performance.

3 Conclusions
In the
present study, we combined several physical chemistry techniques
to probe and monitor biochemical changes within a young E. coli biofilm subjected to a cyclic or a linear
AMP. The combined techniques provided us new insights on the very
different behaviors of the two AMPs. Colistin dramatically and harshly
altered bacterial morphology and cell wall stiffness even though its
action was not homogeneous on the bacterial population. Indeed, some
bacteria remained intact after the treatment and bacterial repopulation
was observed. Here, the cyclic AMP was found to have an impact on
the nucleic acid production of the bacteria and to stiffen the bacterial
cell wall. Besides, a subpopulation of bacteria is able to regrow
after the cyclic AMP treatment. Conversely, no drastic changes in
the bacterial morphology appeared under the catestatin treatment unless
there was occurrence of nanopores in the bacterial membranes. However,
the catestatin action was homogeneous and irreversible over the whole
bacterial population. Indeed, all membranes were permeabilized, and
the bacterial cell wall stiffness was reduced in such an irreversible
way that those bacteria were washed out and unable to regrow after
the treatment. It can be highlighted that this difference and the
gain in antimicrobial activity may be related to the conformational
flexibility of catestatin.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Chemicals and Synthetic Peptides
Colistin sulfate salt,
ampicillin, kanamycin, and phosphate saline
buffer (PBS) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, France. Bovine catestatin
has an amino acid sequence of RSMRLSFRARGYGFRGPGLQL, and it was purchased
from ProteoGenix (Schiltigheim, France). The peptides were stored
at −20 °C as a stock solution at 1 g/L in nonpyrogenic
sterile water (Aqua B-Braun, Melsungen, Germany). Structures and physicochemical
properties of colistin and catestin are reported in Table 1.

4.2 Bacterial
Strain and Culture Conditions
The bacterial model used in
this study is a Gram-negative Escherichia coli mutant called E2146, which is kindly
provided by Institut Pasteur from Paris. This strain was constructed
from Escherichia coli MG1655; it contains
genes that make it fluorescent (green fluorescent protein, GFP) and
is nonflagellated. It is also resistant to specific antibiotics. Strain
E2146 constitutively produces the external ultrastructure type 1 fimbriae.46 The bacterial stock
was maintained at −80 °C. Bacteria were cultured in Lysogeny
Broth (LB, Miller, Fluka) at 25 g/L in deionized water (Purelab Option,
ELGA). All of the cultures were grown in a water bath at 37 ±
1 °C and under continuous agitation at 160 rpm. After an overnight
subculture (16 h, with antibiotics, i.e., ampicillin and kanamycin),
bacteria were cultivated in 200 mL of LB medium (without antibiotics)
in 500 mL conical flasks with an initial optical density at 600 nm
(OD600, measured with a cell density meter, Fisherbrand)
of 0.050 ± 0.005.

4.3 Minimum Inhibitory Concentration
(MIC) Determination
MIC was determined by broth microdilution.
An overnight subculture
of the bacterial strain described above was diluted to OD600 = 0.001. The diluted culture (90 μL) was plated in 96-well
plates in the presence of catestatin or colistin at different concentrations.
After 24 h of incubation, the microorganism growth was assessed by
OD600 using a Multiskan EX microplate spectrophotometer
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). The MIC, defined as the lowest concentration
of drug able to inhibit 100% of the inoculum, was determined from
a modified Gompertz function, as described in previous studies.58 Experiments were performed at least three times.

4.4 Biofilm Submitted to Antibacterial Treatments
Cells in the end of the exponential growth phase (OD600 between 0.5 and 0.6) were harvested by centrifugation (5000g, 10 min, and 4 °C), and the pellet was resuspended
in 200 mL of diluted 1:10 sterile LB medium (at 2.5 g/L, hereafter
called LB/10). This suspension is hereafter called SEc0. Biofilms
were initiated in LB/10 in flow cells containing a germanium (Ge)
crystal. Conditions were adapted from the method described previously,36,59 no preliminary conditioning film was established. SEc0 was pumped
into the flow cell at 50 mL/h during 2.5 h to promote the bacterial
adhesion (30 min in static mode and 2 h in flowing mode). For all
subsequent experiments the flow rate was also set at 50 mL/h. Then,
the bacterial suspension was replaced by LB/10 flow during 3 h to
initiate biofilm development. Two flow cells were used for biofilm
elaboration. For the infrared study, an IR-ATR flow cell (SPECAC,
Kent, United Kingdom) enclosing a Ge crystal was used, as described
elsewhere.31,36 For the AFM study, biofilms were
grown on a disk of Ge in a homemade flow cell.31 Briefly, this flow cell consists of a poly(methyl methacrylate)
base plate that was milled out to form a shallow flow chamber and
had an inlet and exit for liquid. Using a gasket, a glass microscope
plate was clamped on the top of the base to seal the flow cell.

4.5 Peptide Action on the 5.5 h Old Biofilm of E. coli
The 5.5 h old biofilms were exposed
for 24 h to either LB/10 medium, as the control experiment, or to
the AMP at MICs in sterile LB/10 medium. The pH of all solutions was
7.0 ± 0.1. The sterile LB/10 medium solution (40 mL), with or
without AMP, was injected in the flow cell into a new closed circuit
in maintaining the same flow rate as in both previous steps. The inoculations
of the LB/10 medium and the peptide solutions were carefully performed
under sterile conditions, avoiding formation of air bubbles in the
flow cell. An abiotic experiment was conducted with the same conditions,
that is, sterile LB/10 medium was injected in the flow cell during
5.5 h in the open circuit, followed by the flow of the peptide solution
during 24 h in the closed circuit. In another experiment, after the
AMP treatment, the sessile bacteria were subjected to a new, 17 h
long treatment in an open circulation of fresh LB/10 nutrient to assess
whether the AMP treatment was irreversible or not. Two independently
conducted measurements were performed for every experiment, and the
results were consistent.

4.6 ATR-FTIR Spectroscopy
The ATR-FTIR
spectra were recorded between 4000 and 800 cm–1 on
a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer equipped with a KBr beam splitter
and a deuterated triglycine sulfate thermal detector. Spectra recording
and data processing were performed using the Bruker OPUS 7.5 software.
The resolution of the single beam spectra was 4 cm–1. One hundred scans were collected per spectrum, corresponding to
a 1 min accumulation time. All interferograms were Fourier-processed
using the Mertz phase correction and a Blackman–Harris three-term
apodization function. No ATR correction was performed. ATR-FTIR spectra
are shown with an absorbance scale corresponding to log (Rreference/Rsample), where R is the internal reflectance of the device.
A reference spectrum acquired immediately before the step under study
was recorded. Hence, as an example, the spectra reflected only the
time evolution of the cells’ fingerprint in the 5.5 h old biofilm
subjected to LB/10 with or without AMP. Water vapor subtraction was
performed. All spectra were baseline corrected at 3580, 2750, 1800,
and 900 cm–1. FTIR measurements were performed at
21 ± 1 °C in an air-conditioned room. For the biofilm monitoring,
an ATR-FTIR flow cell (SPECAC) enclosing a trapezoidal Ge crystal,
with an incidence angle of 45°, yielded six internal reflections
on the upper face in contact with the sample. In the course of biofilm
monitoring experiments, ATR-FTIR spectra were recorded every 15 min.
The penetration depth of the evanescent wave was about 0.42 and 0.59
μm at 1550 and 1100 cm–1, respectively.31 Thus, assuming a close contact of the bacteria
with the ATR crystal, a single layer of bacteria was analyzed.

4.7 Curve Resolution Analysis: Bayesian Positive
Source Separation
The resolution of pure component spectra
from the “mixture” spectra without any a priori information
was performed with a statistical method of spectral mixture analysis
called BPSS for Bayesian positive source separation. It was developed
on the basis of the Bayesian estimation theory and Markov Chain Monte
Carlo methods. Briefly, in the mixture analysis method, the spectral
data sets resulting from observations of multicomponent substances
are interpreted as a weighted sum of the unknown pure component spectra.
The mixing model assumes that m measured data are
linear combinations of p unknown pure component spectra.
Each mixing coefficient is proportional to the concentration of the jth pure component in the ith mixture.
Additive noise terms represent measurement errors and model imperfections.
By assuming a known number of components, the mixture analysis aim
is to estimate the pure component spectra and the mixing coefficient
profiles from the mixture spectra.60,61 It is possible
to obtain relative concentrations by using BPSS and a mass-balance
constraint without any calibration reference, which allows avoiding
any personal subjective estimation. It must be emphasized that these
concentrations are relative concentrations because they are weighted
by the intensity of the normalized pure component spectra and not
by a separate calibration. The data processing was applied to 95 ATR-FTIR
spectra recorded during the flow of LB/10 with or without peptide
in the closed circuit from 1 to 24 h of the flow. The analyses were
performed on the spectral fingerprint region 1800–900 cm–1.

4.8 Atomic Force Microscopy
AFM images
and force spectroscopy measurements were performed using an MFP3D-BIO
instrument (Asylum Research Technology, Atomic Force F&E GmbH,
Manheim, Germany). The E. coli biofilm
grown onto the Ge surface was gently rinsed with a PBS buffer solution
and slightly dried with nitrogen (0.2 bar for 2 min) before the morphology
analysis by AFM. Topographical images of the biofilms were performed
by contact mode AFM. Silicon nitride cantilevers of conical shape
purchased from Atomic Force (OMCL-TR400PSA-3, Olympus, Japan), with
spring constant of about 20–25 pN/nm used for both imaging
and nanomechanical measurements. All images were recorded with a resolution
of 512 × 512 pixels and a scan rate of 1 Hz. Nanomechanical properties
of the biofilms were measured in PBS buffer solution (pH 7.4) by recording
at least three force–volume Images (FVIs) at different locations
over the biofilm, each consisting of a grid of 32-by-32 force curves
performed with an approach rate of 2 μm/s. The bacterial Young
modulus E was calculated by analyzing the force–indentation
curves according to the Sneddon model.62,63 In this model,
the Young modulus is related to the applied force according to the
equation given below 1  where δ is the indentation depth, ν
is the Poisson coefficient, α is the semitop angle of the tip,
and fBECC is the bottom effect cone correction
function that takes into account the presence of the substrate stiffness.
All of the FVI were analyzed by an automatic Matlab algorithm described
elsewhere,64 and the average values given
in this work were calculated from at least 3072 force curves.

4.9 Fluorescence Optical Microscopy
The
biofilms at the end of the experiments were analyzed by fluorescence
microscopy using intrinsic fluorescence of GFP and the BacLight stain kit (L7012; Molecular Probes, Eugene) to determine the
permeability of the sessile cells and the average bacterial surface
coverage in the absence and presence of the AMP, as described elsewhere.36 With this kit, bacteria with intact membranes
exhibit green fluorescence, whereas bacteria with damaged membranes
show red fluorescence. We have beforehand verified on planktonic bacteria
that the BacLight stain kit is compatible with GFP
fluorescent bacteria. The ATR cell was demounted; the Ge crystal was
carefully removed, and rinsed with nonpyrogenic sterile water to remove
nonadherent cells. The BacLight solution was laid
on the crystal and stained for 20 min in the dark at 21 ± 1 °C.
The crystal was then rinsed with nonpyrogenic sterile water to eliminate
excess BacLight solution and wicked dry with a filter
paper to remove excess water. The sample was mounted in BacLight mounting oil, as described by the instructions provided by
the manufacturer. Both fluorescence images were acquired simultaneously
with the 100× oil immersion objective of an Olympus BX51 microscope
equipped with an Olympus XC50 camera. Buffered glycerin (40% PBS +
60% glycerol, v/v) was used for the mounting of the sample in the
case of the observation of GFP fluorescence.
