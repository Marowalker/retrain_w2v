Mounting evidence has linked gut
microbiome to health benefits
of various functional foods. We previously reported that administration
of a diet rich in black raspberry (BRB) changed the composition and
diverse functional pathways in the mouse gut microbiome. To further
characterize the functional profile in the gut microbiome of mice
on BRB diet, in this follow-up study, we examined the metabolome differences
in the gut microbiome driven by BRB consumption via targeted and untargeted
metabolomic approaches. A distinct metabolite profile was observed
in the gut microbiome of the mice on BRB diet, likely resulting from
a combination of microbiome functional changes and unique precursors
in BRBs. A number of functional metabolites, such as tetrahydrobiopterin
and butyrate that were significantly increased in the gut microbiome
may be linked to the beneficial health effects of BRB consumption.
These findings suggest the important role of the gut microbiome in
the health effects of BRBs and provide a connection among the health
benefits of functional foods and the gut microbiome.

Introduction
The significance of
the gut microbiota has been tremendously recognized
over the past decade. Accumulating evidence suggested that the metabolic
activities in the gut microbiome are profoundly intertwined with human
health and disease.1 Maintaining a well-balanced
gut microbiome is essential to host fitness; and perturbation in the
gut microbial communities can lead to a series of adverse health outcomes.2,3 The metabolic process of dietary precursors by the gut bacteria
produces a spectrum of functional metabolites, through which the gut
microbiota communicate with the host.1,4 A variety of
bacterial metabolites are beneficial. For example, the gut microbiome
is an important source of vitamins such as vitamin B family and vitamin
K.5 Meanwhile, the fermentation of dietary
fiber produces short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that can act as signaling
molecules in diverse pathways and physiological functions.2,6 Butyrate regulates energy homeostasis and adiposity of the host
through stimulating the secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 in intestinal
enteroendocrine L cells and inducing leptin production in adipocytes.7 However, undesirable metabolites can also be
produced by the gut microbiota. A typical example is trimethylamine
(TMA). The gut bacteria can convert dietary choline and carnitine
into TMA,8,9 which is further metabolized to trimethylamine N-oxide in the liver, which is associated with cardiovascular
disease and chronic kidney disease.9,10 Thus, the
functionality of the gut microbiome and its role in human health and
disease is largely established by the metabolite profile.

Consumption
of berries including raspberries, cranberries, and
currants has diverse health benefits, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory,
and anticarcinogenic effects.11,12 A standardized black
raspberry (BRB)-rich diet has been used to explore the functional
role of BRBs in a number of previous studies.13 For example, recent studies clearly demonstrated the anticarcinogenic
effects of the BRB diet on esophageal and oral cancer.14,15 The treatment of the BRB diet also inhibited colonic inflammation
in an experimental model of colitis.16 It
is well accepted that the beneficial effects of berries are attributed
to their abundant phytochemicals such as anthocyanins, flavonols,
ellagitannins, and phenolic acids.17,18 On the other
hand, there is growing evidence that berries can modify the composition
of the gut microbiota.19−21 Given the pivotal role of the gut microbiota in human
health coupled with the health benefits of berries, investigation
of the microbiome changes associated with berry consumption may provide
additional evidence regarding the underlying mechanisms of the beneficial
health effects from berry consumption. In particular, several seminal
studies have reported connections between the gut microbiota and the
health benefits of foodstuff. For instance, the health effects of
the consumption of walnuts and almonds have been linked to the changes
in the gut microbiota.22−24

We previously reported that dietary administration
of BRBs changed
the composition and diverse functional pathways in the mouse gut microbiome,20 which suggested the involvement of the gut microbial
activities in the health effects of BRBs. To further characterize
the metabolic profile in the gut microbiome associated with BRB consumption,
in the present study we combined untargeted and targeted metabolomics
approaches to extensively profile the metabolome signatures of the
gut microbiome. The results revealed a significantly distinct metabolite
profile in the gut microbiome of mice fed BRB diet compared to mice
fed control diet, with increased levels of a number of important metabolites
such as tetrahydrobiopterin and butyrate that confer health benefits.
We also conducted a comprehensive analysis to integrate functional
pathways and metabolic products. Specifically, increased levels of
various vitamins and cofactors in concert with enrichment in their
biosynthetic pathways were discovered in mice fed BRB diet, indicating
that the differences in metabolite profiles could result from the
BRB-driven changes in bacterial metabolic pathways. This study further
confirmed the role that the gut microbiome played in the beneficial
health effects from BRB consumption and provided a functional link
among the functional foods, their health benefits, and the gut microbiome.

Results
Experimental
Workflow
We used a mouse model and a standardized
BRB-rich diet to study the metabolic profile in mouse gut microbiome
with the consumption of BRBs. The formula of the BRB diet used in
the present study has been used in a series of previous studies.13 Fecal samples were collected after 7 weeks of
diet treatment to represent the mouse gut microbial contents. Figure 1A summarizes the
experimental workflow. We combined untargeted and targeted metabolomics
to exhaustively probe gut microbiota-derived metabolites. LC-ESI-TOF
was used to conduct untargeted metabolomics, and MS/MS spectra were
generated to confirm the metabolite identities. GC/MS was used for
the targeted analysis of SCFAs. We also integrated metagenomics and
metabolomics to map the changes in metabolic pathways and products.

Figure 1 Experimental
workflow including pathway analysis and metabolite
profiling (A). Microbiome changes in functional pathways and metabolites
driven by BRB consumption, together with unique precursors in BRB
contribute to the health benefits from BRB consumption (B).

Figure 1B summarizes
the main point of the present study. Seven weeks of BRB diet treatment
substantially changed the metabolic functions of the mouse gut microbiome.
The heat map (Figure 1B, upper right) constructed by comparative metagenome analysis shows
a consistent clustering pattern within the respective diet groups,
indicating a considerably differentiated functional pathway assembly.
More importantly, alterations in microbial metabolic pathways together
with unique precursors in BRBs lead to significant metabolic changes
as shown in the cloud plot (Figure 1, lower right), which may contribute to the underlying
mechanisms of the beneficial health effects of BRB consumption.

BRB Consumption Differentiated Gut Microbiome Metabolite Profile
Revealed by Untargeted Metabolomics
Metabolomics profiling
enables us to assess the changes of metabolites in the gut microbiome.
As shown in Figure 2A, the hierarchical clustering heat map constructed using significantly
changed molecular features shows a consistent clustering pattern within
individual groups. Figure 2B also illustrates that the BRB-fed group is well separated
from the control diet group by principal component analysis (PCA).
We have identified 54 microbiome metabolites that were differentiated
by BRB consumption in the gut microbiome (Table S1), for instance, vitamin-related compounds, amino acid derivatives,
dipeptides and natural products. Together, the data indicate that
the metabolite profiles of these two diet groups are readily differentiated,
with diverse bacterial metabolites being directly produced or modified
by the gut microbiota.

Figure 2 Heat map constructed using molecular features shows that
BRB consumption
significantly changed the metabolite profile in the gut microbiome
(A). Fecal metabolite profiles of mice fed BRB were well separated
from mice fed control diet by PCA (B).

Elevated Levels of Vitamins and Cofactors in the Gut Microbiome
of Mice Fed BRB Diet
Enrichment in vitamin-related metabolites
together with increases in their synthetic pathways were found in
mice fed BRB diet compared to those fed control diet (Figure 3). Metabolites that have vitamin
E antioxidant activity including tocopherols and tocotrienols were
found in higher levels in mice fed BRB diet (Figure 3A–C). Since tocopherols and tocotrienols
are usually found in plants and not synthesized by bacteria,25,26 the increased abundances of tocopherols and tocotrienols probably
came from BRB per se. Moreover, we observed that tetrahydrobiopterin,
a cofactor of multiple important biological reactions, increased 1000-fold
in mice fed BRBs (Figure 3D). The pathway of pterin biosynthesis, which is responsible
for the biosynthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin, also shows a 7-fold increase
(Figure 3E). Likewise,
menaquinone-1, which belongs to vitamin K2 family, increased approximately
4-fold in mice fed BRBs (Figure 3G). Gut bacteria are known as important producers of
vitamins, and menaquinones can be obtained from the gut bacteria.5 Accordingly, the bacterial pathway synthesizing
menaquinones is significantly enriched (Figure 3H). Additionally, to explore the functional
correlation between the changes in metabolic pathways and corresponding
metabolites, we conducted functional correlation by calculating the
Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Clear correlations could
be identified between the synthetic pathway abundances and metabolite
intensities of tetrahydrobiopterin (Figure 3F) and menaquinone-1 (Figure 3I) (ρ > 0.5, p <
0.05), suggesting that the increased levels of these metabolites resulted
from BRB-driven elevation in related synthetic activities. These data
suggest that the levels of various vitamins and cofactors are elevated
in the gut microbiome of mice fed BRBs, either from BRBs per se or
BRB-driven changes in the gut microbiome.

Figure 3 BRB consumption significantly
increased vitamin-related metabolites
in the mouse gut microbiome, as exemplified by vitamin E metabolites
(A–C), cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (D) and menaquinone-1 (G);
meanwhile, gut bacterial pathways involved in the biosynthesis of
tetrahydrobiopterin (E) and menaquinone (H) were upregulated in mice
fed BRB, which shows clear correlation with the abundance of corresponding
metabolites (F, I) (p < 0.05; ρ > 0.5).
(***p < 0.001; **p < 0.01;
*p < 0.05).

Functional Metabolites That Have Beneficial Health Effects in
the Gut Microbiome of Mice Fed BRB Diet
In addition to vitamins
and cofactors, we also observed an enrichment of important metabolites
that may confer health benefits in the gut microbiome of mice fed
BRB diet compared to mice fed control diet (Figure 4). For instance, protocatechuic acid is a
phenolic acid and has distinct antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects.
Protocatechuic acid is a typical metabolite of polyphenols, which
are abundant in BRBs; therefore, it is expected to observe a 900-fold
increase of protocatechuic acid in mice fed BRB diet. Protocatechuic
acid has many beneficial health effects that are recently reviewed.27 We also observed that α-linolenic acid
(ALA) and its further metabolite stearidonic acid increased 3-fold
and 11-fold, respectively. Both of them are important fatty acids
that are known to be abundant in berry fruits.28,29 The abundance of oleoylethanolamine (OEA) increased more than 3-fold,
which is an important signaling molecule as an endogenous peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor α (PPAR-α) agonist. OEA
is involved in the regulation of satiety and bodyweight.30,31 In addition, the abundance of kaempferol 3-sophorotrioside increased
approximately 50-fold, which belongs to flavonoid glycosides. Flavonoid
and derivatives are typical polyphenolic molecules rich in berry fruits,
and kaempferol and its glycosides have many health effects such as
antitumor, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities.32,33

Figure 4 Fecal
metabolites (A–E) that have beneficial health effects
in the gut microbiome of mice fed BRB diet were enriched compared
to mice fed control diet (***p < 0.001; **p < 0.01; *p < 0.05).

BRB Consumption Changed the SCFAs in the
Gut Microbiome
SCFAs are important gut microbial products
of microbial fermentation
with diverse biological functions. We examined the changes of SCFAs
and found that the abundance of butyrate significantly increased in
the gut microbiome of mice fed BRB diet compared to mice fed control
diet (Figure 5). The
levels of acetate and propionate did not show significant differences
between two groups. Butyrate exerts anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting
the release of cytokines and chemokines. Meanwhile, the expression
of tight junction proteins can be improved by intestinal butyrate.1 Therefore, the increased levels of butyrate in
the gut microbiome could contribute to associated health effects of
BRBs.

diets (*p < 0.05; N.S., not significant).

Discussion
Our
previous study has clearly demonstrated the impact of BRB consumption
on mouse gut microbiome at both compositional and functional levels.20 For example, BRB consumption changed multiple
microbiome-related functional pathways including vitamin synthesis
and carbohydrate metabolism.20 The effects
of BRBs on the functional pathways in gut bacteria, together with
the interactions of gut bacterial activities to human health, infer
that BRB-driven microbiome changes may play a role in the health effects
of BRB consumption. Meanwhile, changes in microbial metabolic pathways
could lead to different metabolic products. To further investigate
the functional profile of the gut microbiome associated with BRB consumption,
in this follow-up study we examined the metabolome differences in
the gut microbiome of mice fed BRB diet compared to mice fed control
diet. A significantly distinct metabolite profile was observed, representing
a different functional role of the BRB-shaped gut microbiome. A large
number of metabolites were significantly changed in the gut microbiome
with BRB consumption. Database search using exact masses coupled with
tandem MS/MS analysis identified a number of metabolites that might
account for the beneficial effects of BRB consumption. These findings
may provide mechanistic insights into the gut microbial activities
contributing to the health effects of BRBs.

Accumulating evidence
suggested the importance of the gut microbiome
in host health and disease.34 The composition
and functionality of the gut microbiome can be readily affected by
various intrinsic and extrinsic factors.35 Among these factors, diet received considerable attention. On one
hand, typical Western diet rich in simple sugars and saturated fat
is linked to increased risks of adverse health outcomes such as obesity,
diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, and the gut microbiome is believed
to be involved in this progress.36,37 On the other
hand, healthy dietary patterns such as Mediterranean diet beneficially
impact the host via effects on the gut microbiota such as promoting
bacteria that utilize dietary fiber and produce SCFAs.38 In the present study, we focused on investigating
the impact of a BRB-rich diet on the gut microbiota especially its
metabolic profile for the exploration of the relationship between
BRBs and the gut microbiome. We observed consistent alterations in
bacterial pathways and metabolic products driven by BRB consumption,
suggesting that bacterial functions can be readily altered by dietary
patterns leading to differential metabolic products, thereby differentially
influencing the host.

We previously reported that a number of
bacterial genes encoding
enzymes involved in vitamin and cofactor biosynthesis were enriched
in the gut microbiome of mice fed BRBs.20 Accordingly, we observed increased levels of vitamins such as menaquinone-1
(vitamin K2 family) and important cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin in
the fecal samples of mice fed BRB. However, aside from the contribution
of the gut microbiota, it should be noted that vitamins are naturally
present in berry fruits.39 We also observed
a 1000-fold increase of tetrahydrobiopterin, which is a crucial cofactor
that participates in a series of biological reactions.40 One of these reactions is to convert aromatic
amino acids into precursors of neurotransmitters such as serotonin
and dopamine.41 Thus, the deficiency of
tetrahydrobiopterin is associated with neurological disorders.42 Moreover, insufficient tetrahydrobiopterin also
causes reduced levels of nitric oxide, which contributes to insulin
resistance.43 In addition, it is reported
that the gut microbiome is an exogenous source of tetrahydrobiopterin;44 we discovered increased levels of tetrahydrobiopterin
and its biosynthetic pathway in the gut microbiome of mice fed BRBs.
It is likely that BRB consumption enhances the gut bacterial activities
on the production of tetrahydrobiopterin, providing mechanistic insights
regarding the neuroprotective and antidiabetic effects of BRBs.45−47

As important gut microbiome-derived metabolites, the functions
of SCFAs have been extensively studied. For example, it is well documented
that butyrate has anti-inflammatory activities primarily via the inhibition
of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation in human colonic
epithelial cells.48,49 NF-κB regulates many cellular
genes that are involved in early immune inflammatory responses, and
the activity of NF-κB is frequently perturbed in inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD)50 and colorectal cancer.51 Butyrate therefore plays a protective role in
these diseases.52 Meanwhile, it is demonstrated
that BRB diet has effects against the development of colorectal cancer53,54 and IBD.16 Thus, increased levels of
butyrate in the gut microbiome may be one of the underlying mechanisms
of the anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects of the BRB diet.

Diet is a key factor that influences the gut microbiome; meanwhile,
the metabolic activities of the gut microbiota are also indispensable
regarding the health benefits of functional foods.55 The role of the gut microbiome in the toxicity of environmental
toxic chemicals has been increasingly acknowledged to be of equal
importance; future studies on the role of the gut microbiome in the
health benefits of various functional foods are warranted. Additionally,
the LC–MS analysis in the present study was performed in the
positive mode with an electrospray ionization source. More exhaustive
examination in the negative mode as well as using different ion sources
is warranted.

In summary, we combined untargeted and targeted
metabolomics to
analyze the fecal samples of mice with the administration of BRBs.
Metabolomic profiling revealed that BRB consumption drastically changed
the metabolome of the mouse gut microbiome, with many metabolites
contributing to the beneficial effects from BRB consumption. Taken
together, these results indicate the involvement of the gut microbiome
in the health benefits of BRBs, and the connection among the functional
foods, their health benefits, and the gut microbiome.

Methods
Animals
Custom purified American Institute of Nutrition
(AIN)-76A animal diet (Dyets, Inc., Bethlehem, PA) was used as the
control diet. BRB diet was prepared essentially as described.20 Briefly, whole ripe BRBs (Rubus
occidentalis) of the Jewel variety were freeze-dried
and ground into powder. BRB powder was stored at −20 °C
until being incorporated into AIN-76A animal diet pellets by 10% w/w
concentration at the expense of cornstarch. The diets were stored
at 4 °C until being fed to mice. Mice of the control group were
fed AIN-76A diet, mice of the dietary treatment group were fed BRB
diet. A total of 20 specific pathogen-free C57BL/6 mice (∼8
week old), purchased from Jackson Laboratories, were housed in the
animal facility of the University of Georgia for one week to acclimatize
with standard pelleted rodent diet and tap water provided ad libitum
(protocol number: A2013 06-033-Y3-A3). In the beginning of the diet
treatment, the mice were randomly assigned to either control (AIN-76A
diet) or treatment group (BRB diet). The environmental conditions
were 22 °C, 40–70% humidity, and a 12:12 h light/dark
cycle, and water ad libitum was provided throughout the experiment
period. After 7 weeks, their fecal samples from individual mice were
collected and kept at −80 °C immediately for further analysis.
Regular monitoring of animal health and well-being was done twice
weekly. The animal protocol was approved by the University of Georgia
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

Metagenomics Sequencing
Shotgun metagenomic sequencing
was performed as previously described.56 Briefly, fecal DNA (10 ng/μL) was fragmented using the Bioruptor
UCD-300 sonication device. The Kapa Hyper Prep Kit was used for the
construction of the sequencing library according to manufacturer’s
instructions. The DNA was quantified using Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer.
The sequencing was performed using the Illumina NextSeq High Output
Flow Cell (300 Cycles; PE150) in the Georgia Genomics Facility of
University of Georgia. For bioinformatics analysis, the MG-RAST metagenomics
analysis sever (http://metagenomics.anl.gov, version 4.0.3) was applied for the automatic functional pathway
analysis of metagenomes using the Subsystems database.57

Untargeted Metabolomics Profiling
The LC–MS
analysis was performed as previously described with minor modifications.58 Briefly, 20 mg fecal sample and 50 mg glass
beads (Sigma-Aldrich, MO) were added to 400 μL cooled methanol
solution (methanol/water, 1:1), followed by homogenization using a
TissueLyser (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) at 50 Hz for 10 min. The supernatant
was collected after centrifuging for 10 min at 12 000 rpm,
followed by drying up in a speed vacuum (Thermo), and then resuspending
for injection. The mass spectrometer was interfaced with an Agilent
1290 Infinity II UPLC system. The LC–MS analysis was performed
on a quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-TOF) 6530 mass spectrometer (Agilent
Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) with an electrospray ionization source.
Metabolic features were analyzed in the positive mode over a m/z range of 50–1000 with a C18
T3 reverse-phased column (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA). The XCMS
Online sever (https://xcmsonline.scripps.edu, version 3.5.1) was applied for peak picking, alignment, integration,
and extraction of the peak intensities. MS/MS data were generated
on the Q-TOF for the identification of differentiated molecular features.
The software of MS-DIAL (version 2.90)59 and MS-FINDER (version 2.40)60 were used
for the identification of metabolites based on the MS/MS spectrum.

Quantification of Fecal SCFAs
SCFAs (acetate, butyrate,
and propionate) in the fecal samples were quantified as previously
described.61 Briefly, sample aliquots were
added to NaOH solution (0.005 M) containing internal standards (50
μg/mL of acetic acid-d4, 10 μg/mL
of propionic acid-d2, and 10 μg/mL
of butyric acid-d2), followed by homogenization
and centrifugation. The supernatant were transferred, and a mixture
of 1-propanol/pyridine (3:2, v/v) and propyl chloroformate was subsequently
added for derivatization. After sonication, the propyl formate derivatives
were extracted using hexane and then transferred to an autosampler
vial for injection. An Agilent 7820A GC-5977B MS system (Santa Clara,
CA) coupled with an Agilent DB-5 column (30 m × 0.25 mm ×
0.25 μm) was used for the GC/MS analysis.

Statistical
Analysis of Data
PCA and hierarchical clustering
algorithm were used to visualize the comparison of metabolite profiles.
Two-tailed Welch’s t-test was used to analyze
metabolites that differed in abundance between groups corrected for
the false discovery rate (FDR). The metagenomics sequence count data
for functional analysis were processed using DESeq262 for statistical analysis adjusted for multiple testing
of FDR. The correlation matrix between bacterial pathways and metabolites
was generated using Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Statistical
significances of SCFAs between two diet groups were assessed by Student’s t test.
