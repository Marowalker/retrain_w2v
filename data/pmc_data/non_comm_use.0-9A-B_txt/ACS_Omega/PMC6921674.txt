The innovative plasmon-activated water (PAW) with reduced
hydrogen
bonds exhibits intrinsically distinct properties at room temperature,
which are significantly different from the properties of untreated
conventional deionized (DI) water. Examples of this are their ability
to scavenge free radicals and higher vapor pressure. However, distinct
properties of energetic PAW decay within the day after its creation
in a metastable liquid state. In this work, we report a facile method
for persisting its distinct activities by letting as-prepared PAW
be quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and letting the frozen PAW (for
one month before further measurements) be quickly melted to room temperature
in a warm-water bath (called treated PAW). Experimental results indicate
that the activity of the higher evaporation rate of treated PAW compared
to DI water can be maintained ca. 90% of magnitude, as compared to
the as-prepared PAW. Also, its abilities to scavenge free hydroxyl
and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radicals can be maintained at ca.
70 and 80% of magnitudes, respectively. Moreover, this strategy of
quickly freezing and melting treatments to PAW on persisting in distinct
activity of PAW is effective in oxygen evolution reactions. This promises
the stored energy and the distinct property of created liquid PAW
being available in water-related fields after long-term storage.

Introduction
Water is the most abundant compound on
the earth. It is involved
in many physical processes, and in various chemical and biological
reactions.1−5 The most notable characteristic of water is its ability to form
intramolecular hydrogen bonds (HBs). The different strengths of HBs
result in the presence of water in the solid, liquid, or gas state.
Also, the network interactions of water molecules critically decide
the properties of liquid water. Liquid water can play a central role
in various physical processes and chemical reactions because of its
imperfect tetrahedral symmetry of the HB network, in contrast to ice
with a nearly perfect tetrahedral symmetry around each water molecule
because of strong HBs. It is well known that the dynamic equilibrium
of HBs in liquid water occurs at a picosecond time scale, making the
knowledge on the local structure of water limited.6−9 Thus, all of the generally recognized
properties of liquid water are related to inert bulk water, comprising
the tetrahedral HB network. However, the properties of liquid water
are indeed modified because of the significant change of its HB structure
for confined liquid water,10−12 or liquid water in contact with
hydrophobic surfaces.13−15 Moreover, functional engineered water can be prepared
employing electro-spraying technology for inactivating food-borne
microorganisms, as reported in the literature.16,17 Also, water with the desired functions was developed for actual
applications. The most noticed study is related to hydrogen-rich water,
a powerful hydroxyl radical scavenger, which can efficiently reduce
oxidative damage.18 Meanwhile, acidic cosmetic
water19 and sulfurous water possess similar
anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative functions.20 However, additional additives are necessary for these kinds
of functional water, in which water just acts as a carrier without
changing its original HB structure.

Recently, liquid plasmon-activated
water (PAW) was first created
by innovatively using the effect of hot electron transfer (HET)21,22 which occurred at noble metal nanoparticles for breaking HBs of
bulk water, which can be achieved under illumination with wavelength-optimized
resonant light.23 Also, most of PAW’s
tunable activities are linearly proportional to its degree of nonhydrogen-bonded
structure, which is derived from the O–H stretching in a deconvoluted
Raman spectrum.24 So far, nineteen PAW-related
papers have been published. Examples of this are its creation mechanism23,25 and its innovative applications in green energies of evolution reactions
of oxygen and hydrogen, medicine (lung cancer, hemodialysis, and chronic
sleep deprivation), chemical reactions, and physical processes.26−35 However, the activity of the resulting metastable PAW decayed after
its creation for a couple of days.24,25,28 For expanding convenience in application of PAW,
an innovative strategy on persisting PAW’s distinct activities
is proposed by utilizing quickly freezing and melting methods in this
work. The distinct properties and anti-oxidative activity, as compared
to bulk water, of as-prepared and aged PAW are compared to each other
in detail.

Results and Discussion
Persisting in the Ability on Scavenging Free Radicals of PAW
As shown in our previous studies,21−25 the innovative PAW with reduced HBs exhibits intrinsically
distinct properties at room temperature, which are significantly different
from the properties of untreated conventional deionized (DI) water.
Examples of this are their ability to scavenge free radicals and higher
evaporation rates. Figure S1 demonstrates
the scavenging abilities of as-prepared and 7 day aged PAW, compared
to DI water, on active hydroxyl radicals. The four electro-spin resonance
(ESR) splitting signals shown in Figure S1A are characteristic of hydroxyl radicals.18Figure S1B shows the corresponding statistically
significant results. Compared to DI water, the magnitudes of intensities
of free radicals decreased by 29.02% (p = 0.0007)
and 12.80% (p = 0.0199), respectively, with as-prepared
and 7 day aged PAW. The magnitude of activity of PAW on scavenging
free radicals decreased by 56% after aging for 7 d. Similarly, the
ability of as-prepared and 7 day aged PAW to scavenge radicals also
demonstrated a positive effect on decreasing the corresponding ESR
intensities of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) stable free radicals,
as shown in Figure S2. Compared to DI water,
the magnitudes of intensities of free radicals decreased by 28.42%
(p = 0.0001) and 15.10% (p = 0.0060)
, respectively, with as-prepared and 7 day aged PAW. Also, the magnitude
of activity of PAW on scavenging DPPH free radicals decreased by 47%
after aging for 7 d. These results indicated that the activity of
the metastable liquid PAW would be decayed with time when it was saved
in ambient laboratory air. Thus, developing an innovative strategy
on persisting in distinct activity of PAW is necessary for its extensive
applications.

In biotechnology, low-temperature systems using
liquid nitrogen are popularly employed to save cells and tissues for
persisting their activities in future using. Moreover, effects of
different freezing rates and thawing temperatures on the post-thaw
qualities of sperm36 and camel spermatozoa37 were evaluated in the literature. These ideas
encourage us to utilize the facile liquid nitrogen system to maintain
the activity of the created liquid PAW for further application in
the future. Also, the effects of the freezing rates and the corresponding
melting rates on the persisting in distinct activity of treated PAW
are investigated. Figure 1A shows the corresponding statistically significant results
of scavenging abilities of as-prepared and 1 day aged PAW, compared
to DI water, on active hydroxyl radicals. Compared to DI water, the
magnitudes of intensities of free radicals decreased by 30.68% (p = 0.0096) and 21.09% (p = 0.0019), respectively,
with as-prepared PAW and 1 day aged PAW-4-1. Maintaining the activity
of PAW on scavenging hydroxyl radicals by quickly freezing at −80
°C and quickly melting in a warm-water bath seems to be the optimum
condition, as compared to the as-prepared PAW. In this experimental
condition, the activity of the treated PAW on scavenging free radicals
decreased by a magnitude of 31% after aging for 1 day. Basically,
quickly freezing at −80 °C is better than slowly freezing
at −20 °C, and quickly melting in a warm-water bath is
better than slowly melting in the ambient laboratory air for persisting
the activity of PAW, as shown in Figure 1A. Similarly, compared to DI water, the magnitudes
of intensity of DPPH free radicals decreased by 27.81% (p = 0.0202) and 22.06% (p = 0.0412), respectively,
with as-prepared PAW and 1 day aged PAW-4-1, as shown in Figure 1B. In the optimal
experimental condition (quickly freezing/quickly melting) for maintaining
the activity of treated PAW on scavenging DPPH radicals decreased
by a magnitude of 21% after aging for 1 day, as compared to as-prepared
PAW. Figure S3 exhibits the corresponding
experimental results after aging for 30 days. Maintaining the activity
of PAW on scavenging hydroxyl and DPPH radicals by quickly freezing
at −80 °C and quickly melting in a warm-water bath still
is the optimal experimental condition. The magnitudes of activities
of treated PAW-4-30 on scavenging hydroxyl and DPPH radicals just
decreased by 30 and 13% , respectively, after aging for 30 days, as
compared to as-prepared PAW. Interestingly, the decreases in activities
on scavenging free radicals of hydroxyl and DPPH are slightly different
between the 1 day aged treated PAW and 30 day aged treated PAW based
on optimum conditions. For scavenging hydroxyl radicals, the decreased
magnitudes are 31 and 30% after aging for 1 and 30 days, respectively,
as compared to as-prepared PAW. For scavenging DPPH radicals, the
decreased magnitudes are 21 and 13% after aging for 1 and 30 days,
respectively, as compared to as-prepared PAW. These results indicate
that the storage time has little influence on the activity of the
frozen PAW, making the activity available after long-term storage
of PAW in a solid state.

Moreover, the liquid nitrogen system was used to
quickly freeze
PAW (called super-quickly frozen PAW) for persisting its distinct
property. Figure 2A
shows the corresponding statistically significant results of scavenging
abilities of as-prepared and 1 day aged PAW, compared to DI water,
on active hydroxyl radicals. Compared to DI water, the magnitudes
of intensity of free radicals decreased by 29.26% (p = 0.0063) and 21.39% (p = 0.0006), respectively,
with as-prepared PAW and 1 day aged PAW-6-1. Similarly, as compared
to DI water, the magnitudes of intensity of DPPH free radicals decreased
by 23.32% (p = 0.0006) and 19.60% (p = 0.0001), respectively, with as-prepared PAW and 1 day aged PAW-6-1,
as shown in Figure 2B. In this experimental set, the sample of PAW-6-1 based on the most
quickly freezing (using liquid nitrogen) and melting process demonstrates
the best effect on maintaining the activities on scavenging free radicals.
Moreover, as exhibited in Figure 2, the effect of the freezing/melting process on the
corresponding activity of treated PAW is basically similar to that
shown in Figure 1.
A quick freezing and melting process takes advantage on persisting
the distinct activity of prepared PAW. For activities of PAW-6-1 on
scavenging hydroxyl and DPPH radicals, the decreased magnitudes are
just 27 and 16%, respectively, after aging for one day, as compared
to as-prepared PAW. Meanwhile, similar experiments were performed
for 30 days to investigate the effect of storage time on the corresponding
activity of treated PAW, as demonstrated in Figure 3. Compared to DI water, the magnitudes of
intensity of hydroxyl free radicals decreased by 30.80% (p = 0.0078) and 22.31% (p = 0.0174), respectively,
with as-prepared PAW and 30 day aged PAW-6-30, as shown in Figure 3A. Compared to DI
water, the magnitudes of intensity of DPPH free radicals decreased
by 25.07% (p = 0.0007) and 19.82% (p = 0.0004), respectively, with as-prepared PAW and 30 day aged PAW-6-30,
as shown in Figure 3B. Also, the sample of PAW-6-1 based on the most quickly freezing
and melting process demonstrates the best effect on maintaining the
activities on scavenging free radicals after the aging experiment
was performed for 30 days. For activities of PAW-6-1 on scavenging
hydroxyl and DPPH radicals, the decreased magnitudes are just 28 and
21%, respectively, as compared to as-prepared PAW. Encouragingly,
the decreases in activities on scavenging free radicals are very close
to each other between 1 day aged PAW-6-1 and 30 day aged PAW-6-30,
as comparing Figures 2 with 3. These similar results are observed
on PAW-6-1 and PAW-6-30 suggesting that the storage time has less
influence on the corresponding activity of the frozen PAW, promising
the activity available after long-term storage of PAW in a stable
solid state. Moreover, as discussed in Figures 1–3, S1, and S2, the obtained various decreased magnitudes
in ESR intensities of free radicals based on similar experiments performed
in as-prepared PAW, as compared to those performed in DI water, are
examined. The intensities of the hydroxyl free radicals decreased
by 29.02, 30.68, 29.26, and 30.80%. These decreased magnitudes for
as-prepared PAW compared to DI water are very consistent, promising
good experimental reproducibility. Also, the intensities of the DPPH
free radicals decreased by 28.42, 27.81, 23.32, and 25.07%. The experimental
reproducibility is satisfactory.

Persisting in the Ability on Higher Evaporation Rates of PAW
Compared to DI water, the prepared PAW possesses a reduced HB structure.
This distinct property is responsible for a higher evaporation rate
in ambient laboratory air, as reported before.23,29 Water’s energy is associated with the bounded state of water
molecules. It was reported that the osmotic effects,38 involving HBs, capillary forces, and requirement to restore
water’s free state, can reduce the potential (or activity)
of water. This discourse is based on the assumption of “free
water”, in which HBs do not exist. So far, changes in water’s
activity in different states have not been revealed for pure water.
Generally, a higher vapor pressure of pure water is responsible for
its higher potential (chemical activity),39 making a higher evaporation rate at room temperature. Also, as shown
in our previous report,25 PAW possesses
higher activity, which is in accordance with the increase in activity
observed for confined water.40 As shown
in Figure S4, the magnitude of the evaporation
rate of as-prepared PAW is markedly higher by 41.22%, compared to
that of DI water, after experiments for a half hour at 24.3 °C
with 57.5 relative humidity (RH) %. Basically, quickly freezing at
−80 °C and quickly melting in a warm-water bath still
is the optimum condition for maintaining the activity on a higher
evaporation rate. In this experimental condition, the magnitude of
activity of 1 day aged PAW-4-1 on a higher evaporation rate (the magnitude
of the evaporation rate is higher by 35.81%, compared to that of DI
water) decreased by 13% after aging for 1 day, as compared to as-prepared
PAW.

Compared to instrumental ESR experiments, the experimental
results of the evaporation rate are easily influenced by many factors,
like duration in the experiment, temperature, and RH. Thus, two more
batch experiments were performed to examine the freezing/melting process
on the corresponding activity of the aged PAW. Figure 4A shows the evaporated quantities with time
of DI water and as-prepared and various 30 day aged PAW. In the first
half hour, compared to DI water, the magnitudes of evaporation rates
increased by 44.09 and 39.23%, respectively, with as-prepared PAW
and 30 day aged PAW-4-30 (the optimum sample for maintaining this
activity based on as-prepared PAW). In this experimental condition,
the magnitude of activity of 30 day aged PAW-4-30 on a higher evaporation
rate just decreased by 11% after aging for 30 days, as compared to
as-prepared PAW. These results are consistent with those observed
in Figure S4. After evaporation for 1 h,
the quickly frozen and melted PAW-4-30 is still the optimally treated
PAW. Compared to DI water, the magnitudes of evaporation rates increased
by 24.62 and 22.21%, respectively, with those of as-prepared PAW and
30 day aged PAW-4-30. In this optimally experimental condition, the
magnitude of activity of the higher evaporation rate decreased by
10% after aging for 30 days, as compared to as-prepared PAW. After
evaporations for 2 and 3 h, as shown in Figure 4B, the quickly frozen and melted PAW-4-30
is still the optimally treated PAW, as compared to other treating
processes, although some fluctuations are observed because of the
competing advantage between quickly freezing and quickly melting in
a longer duration. After evaporations for 2 h, compared to DI water,
the magnitudes of evaporation rates increased by 16.23% (16.56% for
3 h) and 13.20% (9.97% for 3 h), respectively, with as-prepared PAW
and 30 day aged PAW-4-30. In this optimally experimental condition,
the magnitude of activity on the higher evaporation rate decreased
by 19% (40% for 3 h) after aging for 30 days, as compared to as-prepared
PAW. Figure S5A demonstrates similar experimental
results based on another batch experiment performed at 24.0 °C
with 58.5 RH %. After aging for 30 days, in the optimal experimental
condition, the magnitudes of activities on higher evaporation rates
of PAW-4-30 (quickly frozen and quickly melted PAW), compared to as-prepared
PAW, decreased by 14 and 27% after evaporations for 0.5 and 1 h, respectively.
Interestingly, compared to DI water, the higher evaporation rates
of as-prepared PAW and PAW-4-30 are very close after evaporations
for 2 and 3 h, as shown in Figure S5B.
Meanwhile, as discussed in Figures 4, S4, and S5, the magnitudes
of higher evaporation rates decreased by 10, 13, and 14%, respectively,
compared to as-prepared PAW after the evaporation experiments for
0.5 h. These close decreased values based on similar batch experiments
indicate that the experimental reproducibility is satisfactory.

°C with 57.5 RH %.

Persisting in the Distinct Property of Negatively Charged PAW
and in Activity on Effective Oxygen Evolution Reactions Utilizing
PAW
As reported in our previous study on the mechanism of
creation of PAW,25 the resulted PAW is
slightly negatively charged because the water clusters are surrounded
by hot electrons. The persistence of metastable PAW is time-dependent
and the prepared PAW loses its activity with time because of the destruction
of the metastable conformation. Figure 5 exhibits the zeta potentials of as-prepared PAW, various
30 day aged PAW, and DI water for reference. As shown in Figure 5A, the zeta potentials
of as-prepared PAW and PAW-6-30 are significantly negative, indicating
they are electron-doping states; while DI water is close to electronically
neutral. Figure 5B
shows the statistical results of zeta potentials of DI water, as-prepared
and various 30 day aged PAW. Compared to DI water at −0.61
± 0.04 mV, the zeta potentials are −27.93 ± 0.65,
−23.87 ± 1.32, and −23.77 ± 0.64 mV for as-prepared
PAW, 30 day aged PAW-5-30 and PAW-6-30 (the optimum samples for maintaining
this distinct property based on as-prepared PAW), respectively. In
this experiment, super-quickly freezing PAW utilizing liquid nitrogen
can maintain the distinct property of PAW with a negatively charged
state; while the quickly or slowly melting process is less important.
Compared to as-prepared PAW, the distinct property of the negatively
charged state of PAW-5-30 or PAW-6-30 just decreased by 15% of magnitude
after aging for 30 days. In other experimental conditions, this distinct
property of the negatively charged state of PAW can be maintained
at around 50% magnitude, ignoring the speed of freezing and melting,
after aging for 30 days.

As per the study on triggering comprehensive enhancement
in oxygen
evolution reactions (OERs) by using PAW, we reported that the created
PAW has an advantage in OERs because the corresponding activation
energy can be effectively reduced by itself.31Figure 6A shows the
linear scan voltammograms (LSVs) of OERs performed in 0.1 N KCl based
on as-prepared PAW, 10 day aged PAW-4-10, and DI water. Clearly, the
recorded currents are higher for as-prepared PAW and PAW-4-10, compared
to DI water. Figure 6B shows the corresponding statistical results of recorded currents
at 1.5 V versus Ag/AgCl in OERs using different water samples. Compared
to DI water, the magnitudes of currents increased by 39.52 and 32.55%,
respectively, with as-prepared PAW and 10 day aged PAW-4-10 (the optimum
sample for maintaining the activity on effective OERs based on as-prepared
PAW). Obviously, quickly freezing in storage has the advantage of
maintaining PAW’s activity on effective OERs. Certainly, quickly
freezing plus quickly melting assembles the best process. Compared
to as-prepared PAW, the magnitude of distinct activity of PAW-4-10
in OERs just decreased by 18% after aging for 10 days.

In biochemistry, alive cell cryopreservation based
on freezing–thawing
technology has broad application in protecting cell activity for long-term
storage. Studies on complicated parametric optimization in cryopreservation
are warranted to improve the quality of frozen–thawed cells,
which is dependent on cell viability or motility.36,37 The freezing rate is one of the most important factor controlling
the life or death of the cell during freezing. The thawing rate is
also critical in preserving the viability of the cell. As shown in
the literature,36 a rapid freezing rate
appeared to be beneficial for kinematics and a higher thawing temperature
resulted in better kinematics. In physical chemistry, the freezing
process results in chemical processes that are deemed to be slow at
room temperature becoming promoted by freezing; it can also produce
unexpected chemical products.41 The cooling
of a solution under laboratory conditions can lead to temperature
variations within the sample. The effect can result in differing thermodynamics
and kinetics of the reaction.41 Compared
to the dynamic equilibrium of HBs in liquid water, the detailed HB
network of ice with a nearly perfect tetrahedral symmetry is more
difficult to be instrumentally certified. In this work, the freezing
rate was controlled by using liquid nitrogen at ca. −200, −20
°C-controlled, and −80 °C-controlled refrigerators.
The melting rate was controlled by using a warm-water bath at 40 °C
and an ambient laboratory air at room temperature. As shown in our
previous studies,23,25 the created PAW from HET is electron-doping
with reduced HBs. The doped hot electron may promote some physical
and/or chemical processes in the freezing process of PAW. In other
words, adequate energies are necessary during the freezing processes
for ordering and attracting. Hence, providing additional energy is
favorable for freezing water.25 It was
previously stated that PAW with fewer HBs possesses a higher energy
potential. Stored energy is available for water molecules with extra
kinetic energy when the ambient temperature rapidly decreases, namely,
the non-HB structure in a high-energy state can transform into an
HB structure in a low energy state, accompanied by a release of available
energy.25 We believe that the more quickly
freezing process in treating PAW is beneficial for ordering and attracting
to form ice with a more perfect tetrahedral symmetry around each water
molecule. More melting heat is necessary for melting the more quickly
frozen PAW to be present in a more energetic liquid state. Certainly,
the more quickly melting process results in liquid PAW maintaining
most of its original distinct properties and activities. Figure 7 demonstrates a proposed
mechanism for the developed strategy on persisting in distinct activity
of PAW based on the experimental results. These interesting findings
and the corresponding detailed mechanisms are worthy of further study
in the future.

and melting processes.

Conclusions
We have successfully utilized the quickly
freezing/melting process
to persist the distinct properties and the corresponding activity
of innovative liquid PAW. After aging for one month, the distinct
property of the negatively charged state of PAW can be maintained
on a level above 80% of magnitude, compared to as-prepared PAW. Also,
the distinct activities on a higher evaporation rate, scavenging free
radicals and effective OERs can be maintained on a level above 70%
of magnitudes, compared to as-prepared PAW. The experimental results
indicate that quickly freezing (using liquid nitrogen or atmosphere
at −80 °C) is more advantageous than quickly melting for
persisting in the distinct activities of PAW. This innovative utilization
of cryopreservation on persisting in the distinct properties and activities
of PAW is the first to be virtually shown in the literature. These
findings promise PAW conveniently applicable in water-related fields
to investigate innovative aspects of effects from liquid PAW.
