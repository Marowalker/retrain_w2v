Zinc oxide (ZnO)
nanoparticles modified with uniformly dispersed
silver (Ag) nanoparticles (Ag-ZnO) were prepared in one step by calcining
precursor electrospun nanofibers. The molar ratios of Ag to Zn in
the precursor solutions were 0, 1, 3, and 5%. The microstructure of
the Ag-ZnO sensor was characterized by scanning electron microscopy
and transmission electron microscopy. The existence of metallic Ag
was confirmed by X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,
and the gas sensing properties of Ag-ZnO were investigated. The results
showed that the ZnO nanoparticles after Ag nanoparticles modification
exhibited excellent gas sensing performance to ethanol and hydrogen
sulfide (H2S). The optimal working temperature of the Ag-ZnO
sensor significantly decreased for ethanol compared with pure ZnO.
The 3% Ag-ZnO sensor exhibited the fastest response to ethanol with
the response/recovery times of only 5 and 9 s, respectively. However,
all the Ag-ZnO-based gas sensors showed a high response value to H2S, especially the 3% Ag-ZnO gas sensor exhibited a maximum
response value of 298 at 10 ppm H2S. These results could
be attributed to the spillover effect and electron sensitization effect
of Ag nanoparticles, which led to more absorbed oxygen species and
active sites, and thereby can further enhance the gas sensing performances
of ZnO-based gas sensors.

1 Introduction
With
the development of the quality of human life, people have
put forward higher and higher requirements for a healthy living environment.
The main source of pollution to the atmosphere is harmful gases, such
as combustible and toxic gases.1−3 These harmful gases not only pollute
the environment but also affect the health of humans in acute and
chronic ways through respiratory and skin pollution.4,5 Some harmful gases may even lead to nerve paralysis, hypoxia, and
even death.6−8 Therefore, the development of gas sensors for rapid
and selective detection has aroused great interest in recent years.9−12 Among various gas sensors, semiconductor gas sensors such as tin
oxide (SnO2), indium oxide (In2O3), and zinc oxide (ZnO) have attracted much more attention in the
past few years due to their high reproducibility, thermal stability,
and low cost.7,8,10,11

ZnO is an important multifunctional
n-type semiconductor material
with a wide direct band gap of approximately 3.37 eV, and it has been
widely used as an active gas sensing material due to its fast response,
short response/recovery time, excellent electrical performance, and
long-term stability compared to other semiconductors.13−15 However, to further improve the gas sensing performance, ZnO has
been modified with various noble metals such as Pt, Au, Ag, Pd, etc.16−19 The modification with Ag has often been used due to its low cost
and simple preparation. Wang et al. prepared Ag-ZnO nanocomposites
to achieve high selectivity to formaldehyde, and its response value
increased from 4.67 to 170 under 100 ppm formaldehyde after Ag doping.20 Tai et al. prepared ZnO-Ag heterostructure nanoparticles
and observed optimal light-assisted NO2 sensing performance
with higher response and sensitivity.21 Algarni et al. reported the synthesis, characterization, and ethanol
gas sensing application of Ag-doped ZnO nanoparticles, which showed
a response of 32 for 200 ppm ethanol gas.22 Gao et al. fabricated Ag-doped ZnO nanoparticles, which showed good
performance for CO gas sensing.23 Chung
et al. reported the Ag nanoparticle-loaded ZnO-reduced graphene oxide
hybrid, which exhibited an enhanced C2H2 sensing
property with excellent repeatability and fast response/recovery times
of 25/80 s.24 According to the above reported
studies, it is crucial to prepare Ag nanoparticles, which can uniformly
disperse on the surface of ZnO with the particle size smaller than
2Ld (Debye length) of ZnO (≈15 nm)25,26 that can accelerate the surface reactions and change the gas diffusivity
assisted with the spillover effect of noble metals and further enhance
the gas sensing performance.27 Therefore,
it should be interesting to obtain uniformly dispersed Ag nanoparticles
with much smaller size on the surface of ZnO. Many kinds of methods
have been employed in recent years to prepare Ag-ZnO materials, such
as coprecipitation, hydrothermal, solvothermal, electrospinning, and
template method.28,29 Among these methods, electrospinning
has been attracted more attention due to its simplicity, versatility,
and low cost.28,29 Moreover, it can also allow uniform
mixing of elements in the precursor solution and uniform distribution
of elements (such as Ag) in the precursor fiber in advance compared
with other methods of crystal growth.

In this study, the ZnO
nanoparticles modified with uniformly dispersed
Ag nanoparticles were prepared in one step by calcining precursor
electrospun nanofibers (Figure 1a). The as-prepared four kinds of ZnO-based gas sensors were
mainly studied for detecting ethanol and H2S gases. The
results showed that the optimal working temperature of Ag-ZnO significantly
decreased for ethanol compared with pure ZnO. Especially, the 3% Ag-ZnO
sensor exhibited a rapid response to ethanol, and all the ZnO-based
gas sensors showed a high response value to H2S. Finally,
the mechanism of gas sensing was discussed in detail to get a deeper
understanding of the importance of modification of Ag nanoparticles
on the surface of ZnO nanoparticles.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Material
Characterization
The phase
and crystal structure of the prepared pure ZnO nanoparticles and Ag-ZnO
nanoparticles were characterized by XRD. As shown in Figure 2a, the XRD pattern of pure
ZnO nanoparticles well matched with the standard JCPDS file card no.
36-1451 of the pure ZnO hexagonal wurtzite structure. No characteristic
peaks of any other impurities were observed, indicating good phase
purity of obtained ZnO nanoparticles. The XRD patterns of 1% Ag-ZnO,
3% Ag-ZnO, and 5% Ag-ZnO materials shown in Figure 2b–d revealed that all the additional
three peaks indexed to JCPDS file card no. 65-2871 of Ag attributed
to the lattice planes Ag(111), Ag(200), and Ag(220). The comparison
among Figure 2a–d
suggested that the formation of Ag in the calcination process had
no influence on the crystal structure of ZnO.4 The diffraction peaks associated with Ag also increased gradually
on increasing the modification amount of Ag.

ZnO, (b) 1% Ag-ZnO, (c) 3% Ag-ZnO, and
(d) 5% Ag-ZnO.

The micromorphology of pure ZnO
and Ag-ZnO nanocomposites was observed
by SEM. The precursor nanofibers of 3% Ag-ZnO with a diameter of 100
nm are shown in Figure 3a. Nanofibers no longer existed after calcination; rather, they changed
into the nanoparticles of the hexagonal structure with a size of about
100 nm (Figure 3b–e).
In addition, the size of the ZnO nanoparticles did not change after
Ag modification; however, they were more uniform than the pure ZnO.
Furthermore, the elemental composition of 3% Ag-ZnO was analyzed by
the energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS), which showed that only Zn,
O, and Ag were present in the 3% Ag-ZnO (Figure 3f).

Ag-ZnO, (b) pure ZnO,
(c) 1% Ag-ZnO, (d) 3% Ag-ZnO, and (e) 5% Ag-ZnO and (f) EDS spectrum
of 3% Ag-ZnO (the inset is the amount of elements).

The nanostructure of 3% Ag-ZnO nanoparticles was characterized
by TEM analysis. Figure 4 shows the typical TEM image of 3% Ag-ZnO nanoparticles, and it can
be clearly seen that the size of as-prepared nanoparticles was around
100 nm after calcination and the size of Ag nanoparticles was found
to be around 3–5 nm. HRTEM observation for the crystallinities
of the ZnO and Ag is shown in Figure 4. The lattice fringe spacings of 0.247 and 0.26 nm
correspond to the (101) and (001) planes, respectively, which were
consistent with the slandered XRD pattern. The uniform distribution
of Ag nanoparticles could be seen from the HRTEM images as confirmed
by the lattice fringe spacings of 0.235 and 0.15 nm, which correspond
to the (111) and (110) planes, respectively, which were in excellent
agreement with the standard XRD pattern of Ag. Furthermore, the presence
of Ag was also confirmed by the individual element mapping, which
showed the presence of the uniformly distributed Ag element in the
3% Ag-ZnO nanoparticles along with Zn and O (Figure 4d). Moreover, the presence of three peaks
in XRD at (111), (200), and (220) confirmed that the Ag was present
in the metallic state. In addition, no characteristic peaks of any
other impurities were observed except ZnO and Ag. The results of EDS
also showed that the presence of Ag in the 3% Ag-ZnO nanoparticles
in low quantity (0.27 wt %).

Figure 4 (a) TEM images of 3% Ag-ZnO nanoparticles, (b,
c) HRTEM image of
3% Ag-ZnO nanoparticles, and (d) Zn, O, and Ag elements mapping of
3% Ag-ZnO nanoparticles.

The surface elemental
composition and chemical species of 3% Ag-ZnO
nanoparticles were investigated by XPS and showed that all the peaks
belong to Ag, Zn, O, and C elements (Figure 5a). The presence of the C 1s peak might be
from the conductive adhesive in the measurement. Figure 5b shows the Zn 2p spectrum
of 3% Ag-ZnO that contains two typical peaks of Zn 2p3/2 (1021.7 eV)
and Zn 2p1/2 (1044.7 eV) with a splitting distance of 23.1 eV, indicating
that the Zn element existed in the form of Zn2+.30,31 From Figure 5c, it
could be observed that the O 1s spectrum was asymmetric; therefore,
the O 1s spectrum was divided into two peaks located at 531.5 and
530 eV, indicating that the oxygen formed two different chemical bonds,
which were attributed to the lattice oxygen of ZnO and oxygen of hydroxyl.32,33 In Figure 5d, two
peaks centered at 367.4 and 373.4 eV could be attributed to Ag 3d5/2
and Ag 3d3/2, respectively. The two peak positions of Ag 3d shifted
remarkably to lower binding energies compared with those of bulk Ag
(Ag 3d5/2, 368.2 eV, and Ag 3d3/2, 374.2 eV).34 The shift in binding energy of Ag was mainly due to electron transfer
from metallic Ag to ZnO crystals.35,36 When the metallic
Ag nanoparticles and the ZnO nanoparticles contact with each other,
they adjust the position of the corresponding Fermi level to the same
value. Therefore, there are many free electrons on the new Fermi level
of metallic Ag nanoparticles. Since the conduction band (CB) of the
ZnO nanoparticles is vacant, the free electrons can tunnel into the
CB, resulting in a higher valence state of Ag.35,37 In addition, the splitting distance of the two central peaks is
6 eV that also can give the evidence of metallic Ag modification,33 which is in excellent consistent with the XRD
results.

(c) O 1s, and (d) Ag 3d in 3% Ag-ZnO.

Figure 6 shows the
PL spectrum of Ag-ZnO with an excitation wavelength of 400 nm to investigate
the recombination of electron–hole pairs.38 The PL spectra intensity of Ag-ZnO nanoparticles decreased
after Ag modification compared with pure ZnO. This can be attributed
to the fact that Ag nanoparticles can effectively block the recombination
of electron–hole pairs, which is better for adsorption of oxygen
molecules on the surface of ZnO in gas sensing detection.39,40Figure 6b shows that
the specific surface areas of pure ZnO, 1% Ag-ZnO, 3% Ag-ZnO, and
5% Ag-ZnO nanoparticles correspond to 6.03, 6.65, 4.69, and 4.97 m2/g, respectively. The type IV isotherms with H3 hysteresis
loops indicated the presence of pores in the material,4 which were mainly the stacked pores among ZnO nanoparticles,
as shown in the inset of Figure 6b.

2.2 Gas Sensing Performance of Fabricated Sensors
to Ethanol
The optimal operating temperature is one of the
major factors of the sensors to evaluate gas sensing performance.
To obtain the optimal operating temperature of the sensors prepared
with pure ZnO, 1% Ag-ZnO, 3% Ag-ZnO, and 5% Ag-ZnO, the responses
of 100 ppm ethanol were studied under different temperatures, and
the results are shown in Figure 7a. The optimal operating temperature of ZnO significantly
decreased after Ag modification. The sensing response to ethanol increased
with increasing temperature and reached the maximum value at 320 °C.
However, the optimal temperature for pure ZnO could not be obtained
due to the detection limit of the instrument. Figure 7a also shows that Ag-ZnO nanoparticles have
a higher response value than pure ZnO nanoparticles, which could be
attributed to the small size effect of Ag nanoparticles. When the
average particle size of Ag is only 3–5 nm, which is smaller
than 2Ld (the thickness of the depletion layer) of ZnO (≈15
nm),26 electron transit is controlled by
the depletion layer and displays the excellent sensing performance.
The small difference in the specific surface area also proved that
the Ag modification on the surface of ZnO nanoparticles plays an important
role in gas sensing performance. Interestingly, the specific surface
area decreased, and no larger variation in the pore size was observed
(Figure 6b inset) after
Ag modification, but still, the gas sensing performance increased,
which further suggested that the increase in the gas sensing performance
was due to the small size effect of Ag nanoparticles.

Figure 7 (a) Response of the sensors
to 100 ppm ethanol under different
operating temperatures (200–400 °C), (b) response/recovery
curve of the sensors to 100 ppm ethanol at 320 °C, (c) response
curves of the 3% Ag-ZnO sensor toward 20–500 ppm ethanol at
320 °C (the inset shows the response curves of the 3% Ag-ZnO
sensor toward 2–10 ppm ethanol), and (d) the repeatability
test of the 3% Ag-ZnO sensor toward 100 ppm ethanol at 320 °C.

Figure 7b shows
the response/recovery time of Ag-ZnO sensors when they were exposed
to 100 ppm ethanol at an optimum operating temperature of 320 °C.
The results showed that the response/recovery times of the 3% Ag-ZnO
sensor to 100 ppm ethanol were only 5 s/9 s, respectively. It showed
the fastest response/recovery time compared with other sensors having
different Ag modification amounts, and it was near about 5 times faster
than pure ZnO (23 s/40 s).

The dynamic response and recovery
characteristic curves to different
concentrations of ethanol (2–500 ppm) under the optimal temperature
are tested as shown in Figure 7c. The gas responses increased on increasing the gas concentration.
Besides that, the low detection limit of the 3% Ag-ZnO sensor to ethanol
was found to be 2 ppm with a response value of around 1.8 (shown in
the Figure 7c inset).
After this, the repeatability test of the 3% Ag-ZnO sensor for 100
ppm ethanol was performed under optimal operating temperature, and
the results are shown in Figure 7d. Four successive response recovery cycles were provided
at the optimal operating temperature, but there was only a slight
variation in all the four cycles, which proved the good repeatability
of the 3% Ag-ZnO gas sensor. The gas sensing performances of the 3%
Ag-ZnO gas sensor in our study compared with other ZnO composites
are organized in Table 1, and it exhibited a faster and higher response to ethanol.

2.3 Gas Sensing Performance of Fabricated Sensors
to H2S
The responses to 1 ppm H2S under
different temperatures were studied, and the results are shown in Figure 8a. All the Ag-ZnO
sensors showed a relatively low optimal temperature of 120 °C.
However, the 3% Ag-ZnO sensor displayed the highest response value,
which was near 5 times higher than pure ZnO. All the samples showed
a relatively low optimum temperature and high response compared with
other reported ZnO-based nanocomposites (Table 2). From Figure 8b, it could be clearly seen that Ag-ZnO sensors
displayed a similar response/recovery time to 1 ppm H2S
measurement under the optimal operating temperature. The response/recovery
time of the 3% Ag-ZnO sensor for H2S detection was found
to be 530 s/700 s, respectively. In addition, the dynamic response
and recovery characteristic curves to different concentrations of
H2S (1–10 ppm) under the optimal temperature were
tested and are shown in Figure 8c. It could be observed that the gas responses increased on
increasing the gas concentration. The mechanism of H2S
detection is discussed in detail in the following section: Mechanism of Gas Sensing. Moreover, response reproducibility
and complete recovery are also important parameters for gas sensors. Figure 8d shows that the
3% Ag-ZnO sensor exhibited excellent repeatability in four successive
response recovery cycles with similar response values and response/recovery
times, and for each run, the response could basically restore its
initial state.

The responses of pure ZnO and Ag-modified
ZnO sensors toward 10
ppm ethanol, acetone, formaldehyde, and toluene at 320 °C and
H2S at 120 °C were measured, and the response histogram
is shown in Figure 9. It could be clearly seen that all the prepared sensors exhibited
a high response value for H2S. Besides that, Ag-ZnO sensors
showed higher response value than a pure ZnO sensor to these five
kinds of gases, which further proved the importance of Ag modification
for enhancing the ZnO-based gas sensors.

2.4 Mechanism of Gas Sensing
Up to now,
the most widely accepted gas sensing mechanism of semiconductor oxide
is the model based on the electron transfer dynamics during an adsorption–oxidation–desorption
process, which can change the resistance value of the sensors.51 The response of a typical n-type semiconductor
greatly depends on the electron concentration. As shown in Figure 10a, when the gas
sensor is exposed in the air, the oxygen molecules adsorb on the surface
of ZnO nanoparticles and trap electrons from the conduction band (CB)
of ZnO to form different oxygen species (O2–, O–, and O2–).52,53 The reduction of electron concentration leads to a thicker electron
depletion layer of pure ZnO. For ZnO nanoparticles with Ag modification,
more oxygen molecules can be transferred from the Ag nanoparticles
to the surface of the ZnO nanoparticles due to the spillover effect
of Ag. Successively, more electrons can be trapped from the CB of
ZnO, and more oxygen species can be generated.54 In addition, the surface of metallic Ag can adsorb oxygen
molecules and generate oxygen species due to its electron sensitization
effect.55 Based on the above two effects,
the Ag-ZnO nanoparticles can produce a thicker electron depletion
layer compared with pure ZnO. This process is shown in Figure 10b.

Figure 10 Schematic diagrams of
the gas sensing mechanism of (a) pure ZnO,
(b) Ag-ZnO in air, (c) Ag-ZnO in ethanol, (d) Ag-ZnO in low H2S concentration, and (e) Ag-ZnO in high H2S concentration.

When the ethanol and low concentration of H2S (lower
than 2 ppm in our study) are injected into the chamber as the target
gases, the ethanol and H2S molecules adsorb onto the material
surface and can react with different oxygen species. The electrons
can be then fed back to CB of ZnO to increase electron concentration,
decreasing the thickness of electron depletion layer,56,57 and this can be described by the following equations (eqs 1 and 2) and is shown in Figure 10c,d. 1   2  

However, when H2S reached in a certain concentration
(higher than 2 ppm in our study), the H2S molecules might
have not only reacted with the oxygen ions (O–)
adsorbed on the surface (eq 2) but also have reacted with ZnO, which would have converted
ZnO into ZnS; this can be described by eqs 3 and 4, and this mechanism
of gas sensing are shown in Figure 10e. Since ZnO is an n-type semiconductor in which oxygen
vacancies originate the carriers. The oxygen vacancies tend to be
captured by the chemisorbed S generated due to the surface reactions.
When the S diffuses into ZnO, it supplies excess carriers to the conduction
band, which increase the electrical conductivity of ZnO.58 Therefore, the metallic ZnS could increase the
conductivity and the surface active sites, which could further reduce
potential barrier and resistance of the sensing material.47 3   4  

Both kinds of gas sensing mechanisms for H2S detection
were confirmed in our study, and the gas sensing results under different
concentrations of H2S are shown in Figure 8b. It can be clearly seen that the response
value jumped when the H2S concentration increased from
1 to 2 ppm but attained a steady growth process when the H2S concentration changed from 2 to 10 ppm. It could be concluded that
the mechanism of gas sensing for H2S detection changes
when the concentration of H2S increases from 1 ppm to 2
ppm.

3 Conclusions
The ZnO nanoparticles modified
with uniformly dispersed Ag nanoparticles
were obtained in one step by calcining of precursor electrospun nanofibers,
and their gas sensing performance was tested. Compared with the pure
ZnO sensor, Ag-ZnO sensors exhibited preferable gas sensing properties
to ethanol and H2S. However, the 3% Ag-ZnO nanoparticle
sensor exhibited the fastest response/recovery times to ethanol of
about 5 and 9 s, respectively. Besides that, the Ag-ZnO-based nanoparticle
sensors also showed a high response value to H2S, and the
3% Ag-ZnO sensor showed a maximum response value of 298 with 10 ppm
H2S. In addition, the 3% Ag-ZnO sensor exhibited good repeatability
in the gas sensing tests, which could be attributed to the spillover
effect and electron sensitization effect of Ag that led to the generation
of more oxygen species and active sites, which was beneficial for
the adsorption of ethanol and H2S molecules on the surface
of ZnO nanoparticles. Thus, ZnO nanoparticles modified with uniformly
dispersed Ag nanoparticles provide a new approach for the development
of gas sensors with high gas sensing performance.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials
Zinc
nitrate hexahydrate
(Zn(NO3)2·6H2O), silver nitrate
(AgNO3), poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP, Mw=1300000), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), and ethanol
(≥99.7%) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co.,
Ltd. All chemicals were of analytical grade and used without any further
purification. Ultrapure water was used throughout the experiments.

4.2 Preparation of Ag-ZnO Nanoparticles
ZnO
nanoparticles with Ag modification (Ag-ZnO) were prepared in
two steps (the scheme of preparation is shown in Figure 1a). In the first step, precursor
nanofibers were prepared with an electrospinning technique. PVP (1.5
g), Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (2 g), and
varied amounts of AgNO3 (corresponding to different molar
ratios of Ag to Zn: 0, 1, 3, and 5%) were added into 24 mL of mixed
solution of ethanol, N,N-dimethylformamide
(DMF), and ultrapure water (v/v 2:1:1). This solution was then poured
into a 10 mL plastic syringe, and a high voltage of 16 kV was applied
between a stainless steel collector and needle tip at a distance of
16 cm. A feed rate of 0.04 mm/min was kept constant via a peristaltic
pump. The obtained precursor nanofibers were collected on the alumina
crucible. In the second step, precursor nanofibers were calcined in
the muffle furnace, first at 350 °C for 2 h, and then the temperature
was increased to 600 °C for another 2 h to remove organic matter
thoroughly. The heating rate was maintained at 2 °C/min. The
obtained Ag-ZnO nanoparticles were labeled as pure ZnO, 1% Ag-ZnO,
3% Ag-ZnO, and 5% Ag-ZnO for 0, 1, 3, and 5% molar ratios of Ag to
Zn, respectively.

4.3 Characterization Techniques
The phase
and crystallinity of the samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction
(XRD, Germany Bruker AXS D8 Advance). The morphologies of the samples
were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, USA FEI Sirion
200) and field emission transmission electron microscopy (FETEM, USA
Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN). The surface elemental composition and chemical
species were evaluated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, USA
Thermo Fisher Scientific Thermo ESCALAB 250Xi). The specific surface
area was measured by nitrogen (N2) adsorption-desorption
(BET, USA Micromeritics ASAP2460). The photoluminescence (PL) data
were recorded by using an F-380 (Tianjin Gangdong Technology Development
Co., Ltd. China) to explain the electron transfer situation.

4.4 Sensor Fabrication and Gas Sensing Measurement
A suitable
amount of the as-prepared Ag-ZnO nanoparticles was mixed
with anhydrous ethanol to form a slurry suspension and coated onto
an alumina sheet by the screen printing method, which was supported
by a pair of Ag electrodes at each end and dried naturally to remove
the anhydrous ethanol.

The gas sensing properties were measured
by a chemical gas sensor-4 temperature pressure (CGS-4TP) small intelligent
gas sensing analysis system (Beijing Elliott Technology Co., Ltd.,
China) at room temperature. The photograph of the CGS-4TPs gas sensor
system with the schematic of the circuit diagram of the gas sensing
measurement setup is shown in Figure 1b. First, the alumina sheet was placed on the test
platform and connected with a probe, and then the working temperature
was set on the operation interface. After reaching the target working
temperature, the base resistance (Ra) of the test sample in the background
gas (in air) was analyzed. Then, the resistance (Rg) of the test sample
under the target gas was analyzed, and when the resistance stabilized
to the initial value in the background gas, the test was completed.
In our work, the ethanol and H2S in calculated concentrations
were introduced separately as the target gases into a 1.8 L testing
chamber of the gas sensing test system by a microsyringe. The sensor
response (Rs) is defined as the ratio of sensor resistance (Ra) in
air to sensor resistance (Rg) in target gas. The response/recovery
time is defined as the time required for the sensors to reach 90%
of the change in total adsorption/desorption resistance, respectively.
