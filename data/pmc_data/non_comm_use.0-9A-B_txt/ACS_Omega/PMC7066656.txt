Red
pigmented marine bacteria, Pseudoalteromonas
rubra strains PS1 and SB14, were isolated from two
sampling locations in different ecosystems on Alor Island, Indonesia,
and cultured in the laboratory. We analyzed the 16S rRNA gene sequences
and examined the pigment composition and found that both strains produced
cycloprodigiosin (3), prodigiosin (4), and
2-methyl-3-hexyl-prodiginine (5) as major compounds.
In addition, we detected three minor compounds: prodigiosin derivatives
2-methyl-3-propyl prodiginine (1), 2-methyl-3-butyl prodiginine
(2), and 2-methyl-3-heptyl-prodiginine (6). To our knowledge, this is the first report that P. rubra synthesizes not only prodigiosin and cycloprodigiosin
but also four prodigiosin derivatives that differ in the length of
the alkyl chain. The antimicrobial activity of cycloprodigiosin, prodigiosin,
and 2-methyl-3-hexyl-prodiginine was examined by a disk-diffusion
test against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella
typhi, and Candida albicans. We found that, at a concentration of 20 μg/mL, cycloprodigiosin
showed the greatest inhibition (25.1 ± 0.55 mm) against S. aureus.

Introduction
Antimicrobial agents
are drugs generally obtained from microorganisms
that are crucial to the prevention and treatment of bacterial infection.
However, the use of antibiotics in medicine, which is too frequent
and inappropriate, contributes to the rapid spread of antibiotic resistance.1 Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a serious
global problem. A previous report from the World Health Organization
(WHO) combined available global data on AMR in seven common bacterial
pathogens2 and highlighted a lack of systematic
data on AMR in Southeast Asia.3 Nevertheless,
it was reported that nosocomial infections caused by antimicrobial-resistant
bacteria resulted in 38,481 deaths in Thailand.4 New drugs are needed because of decreases in drug efficacy
and the need to combat antibiotic resistance. Marine microorganisms
represent a significant source of new drugs for development due to
their rich biodiversity and genetic capacity to produce unique metabolites.

Prodiginines are a family of microbial red pigments produced as
secondary metabolites by many bacterial species.5−7 There are two
types of prodiginines:7,8 linear alkyl side chain-containing
compounds, such as prodigiosin and undecylprodigiosin, and cyclic
compounds, such as cycloprodigiosin, metacycloprodigiosin, prodigiosin
R1, and streptorubin B. Prodiginines have received considerable interest
because of their numerous biological activities, including antimicrobial,9 anticancer,10,11 antitumor,12 and anti-inflammatory activities.13 Recent studies have shown that the antimicrobial
effect of prodigiosin on bacterial physiology was concentration-dependent.
In Escherichia coli cells treated with
prodigiosin above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), no significant
DNA damage or cytoplasmic membrane disintegration was observed.14 However, prodigiosin was observed to be responsible
for plasma membrane leakage.15

Although
prodiginines were extracted from the terrestrial bacteria Serratia marcescens(16,17) early on,
these compounds were later obtained from several bacteria in the genera Pseudomonas, Pseudoalteromonas, Hahella, Vibrio, and Zooshikella, which were isolated from different marine habitats.18−20 The genus Pseudoalteromonas is a group of widespread
marine bacteria. There are three species from this genus, Pseudoalteromonas (P.) rubra, P. denitrificans, and P. bacteriolytica, which are
known to produce prodigiosin.21−23

Currently, of the 200 Pseudoalteromonas genomes
submitted to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI),61 there are nine genomes that are code
for biosynthetic enzymes that responsible for synthesize prodiginines:
one belongs to P. denitrificans, and
eight belong to P. rubra.24P. rubra strain
ATCC 29570 (formerly Alteromonas rubra NCMB 1890) isolated from the Mediterranean Sea is a Gram-negative,
red, and motile marine bacterium that has antibiotic activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis.21 This strain has been reported to synthesize prodigiosin; however,
there is little information on the prodigiosin itself, except for
absorption spectra of the crude pigment extract. Later, fractionation
of a prodigiosin extract was conducted using a high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) system. Several prodigiosins were separated,
but there was no detailed compound identification provided. Gerber
and Gauthier25 found a new prodigiosin-like
pigment from P. rubra with a molecular
mass of (m/z) 321 that is known
as cycloprodigiosin. Over more than three decades, other types of
prodigiosin derivatives, 2-methyl-3-butyl-prodiginine, 2-methyl-3-hexyl-prodiginine,
and 2-methyl-3-heptyl-prodiginine, were identified in the marine bacterium Pseudoalteromonas sp. 1020R, which has 99% homology to P. rubra.26 Strain 1020R
produced only prodigiosin and its derivatives with different alkyl
chains. Until now, there have been no reports on a P. rubra strain that contains cycloprodigiosin, except
for the originally identified P. rubra strain (ATCC 29570). The previous studies indicate that the strains
of P. rubra are compositionally heterogeneous
in terms of prodigiosins, and information concerning prodigiosins
composition in each strain is important to distinguish subspecies
among the strains of P. rubra.

Recently, we isolated two new marine bacterial strains that have
UV–Vis spectral characteristics of prodigiosins. The strains
were designated P. rubra PS1 and P. rubra SB14 according to a 16S rRNA sequence analysis
and blast search, which revealed more than 99% similarity to P. rubra ATCC 29570. The prodigiosins were successfully
separated and identified by reversed-phase (RP)-HPLC, and the purified
compounds were identified by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry
(ESI-MS/MS). Here, we report the bacterial isolation and the determination
of the prodigiosin composition and the antimicrobial activity of three
types of prodiginines isolated from P. rubra strain PS1 against pathogenic microorganisms such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhi, and Candida albicans.

Results and Discussion
Bacterial
Isolation and Spectrophotometric Analysis
Two strains were
successfully isolated from different habitats. Strain
PS1 was isolated from seawater in a habitat dominated by seagrasses
and mammals such as Dugong dugon in
Sika Island. Strain SB14 was isolated from seawater in a habitat of
a healthy coral reef ecosystem in Sebanjar Beach (Figure 1A,B). The UV–Vis absorption
spectra of the methanol extract of strains PS1 and SB14 were characterized
by a broad band in the 400–600 nm wavelength range with an
absorption maximum (λmax) at 536 nm and a shoulder
at 512 nm (Figure 1C). These spectra were identical to the UV–Vis absorption
spectrum of prodiginine pigments.27,28 The UV–Vis
spectra of prodiginine were also recorded in 95% MeOH at different
pH values. Under acidic conditions (pH 2, adjusted with 0.01 N HCl),
its color was red with λmax at 536 nm. Under neutral
conditions, the color changed to pink, and the intensity decreased.
Under alkali conditions (pH 12, adjusted with 0.01 NaOH), it was orange,
and the spectra shifted to the left with λmax at
465 nm (Figure 2),
indicating deprotonation of the nitrogen atoms on the three conjugated
pyrrole rings by NaOH.29 These spectral
changes are in line with the ones reported by Song et al.30

Molecular Identification of Bacteria
The 16S rRNA gene
sequences of strains PS1 and SB14 comprised 1294 and 1343 bp, respectively.
The nucleotide data from both strains have been deposited in the DNA
Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ; https://ddbj.nig.ac.jp) with accession numbers LC476556 and LC487904 for strains PS1 and
SB14, respectively. The similarity of the 16S rRNA genes of these
strains was calculated using the nucleotide BLAST program (NCBI) for
highly similar sequences (megablast). A comparative study of the 16S
rRNA gene sequences showed that strains PS1 and SB14 shared 99.46
and 99.48% sequence similarity, respectively, with P. rubra strain ATCC 29570. In the phylogeny constructed
as a neighbor-joining tree, strains PS1 and SB14 were grouped with P. rubra strain ATCC 29570, with a bootstrap resampling
value of 91% (Figure 3). The relationship of strains PS1 and SB14 with P.
rubra strain ATCC 29570 was also determined in trees
constructed with the maximum-likelihood and maximum-parsimony algorithms,
and the recovered nodes are marked by asterisks in Figure 3 below.

At the time of writing this report,
there were 45 strains of P. rubra,
including our two strains, which were isolated
from different sources, that have been deposited in the NCBI (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) (Table S1, Supporting Information). P. rubra has been discovered throughout the region
spanning the Indian Pacific to Atlantic Oceans. However, most strains
have been found in the Indo-Pacific area (Figure S1, Supporting Information). The first P. rubra strain identified with prodiginine production capability was isolated
from seawater.21 The 45 strains were isolated
from various habitats: 14 from seawater, 7 from coral, 5 from macroalgae,
4 from tunicates, 3 each from sponges and copepods, 2 each from nudibranchs
and mussels, and 1 each from sediment, protist, fish, leaf, and larval
stone (Figure S2, Supporting Information).

HPLC Analysis of Prodiginine and Its Derivatives
Prodiginine
and its derivatives from the pigment extracts of P.
rubra strains PS1 and SB14 were separated on a C8 column. Both strains have the same prodiginine composition
based on their HPLC chromatograms. The HPLC separation profile contains
six well-resolved compounds (Figure 4).

Figure 4 HPLC chromatogram of the crude pigment extract of P. rubra strain PS1 and the UV–Vis spectra
of the eluent peaks.

The first two compounds,
peaks #1 and #2, are minor compounds eluted
at retention times (tR) of 1.66 and 1.94
min with λmax at 532 and 531 nm, respectively. The
third compound (peak #3) eluted at a tR of 2.16 min with λmax at 537 nm. The fourth compound
(peak #4) eluted at a slightly more nonpolar tR than peak #3 and was a major compound with a tR of 2.52 min and λmax at 537 nm. The
last two compounds (peaks #5 and #6) had a tR of 3.00 and 3.69 min and λmax at 535 and
536 nm, respectively. Next, the six compounds (peaks #1, #2, #3, #4,
#5, and #6) were analyzed in highly purified samples (purity of >97%)
by ESI-MS/MS and assigned as follows with descriptions below: 2-methyl-3-propyl
prodiginine (peak #1), 2-methyl-3-butyl prodiginine (peak #2), cycloprodigiosin
(peak #3), prodigiosin (peak #4), 2-methyl-3-hexyl prodiginine (peak
#5), and 2-methyl-3-heptyl prodiginine (peak #6). The identification
of prodigiosin and four derivatives was confirmed by the linear relationship
between the log capacity factor (k′) of the
pigments and the number of the carbon atoms in the alkyl side chain
of the pigment molecule (Figure S3, Supporting
Information), as shown previously for esterifying alcohols in chlorophylls31 and hydroxyl moieties in β-carotene congeners.32 The characteristics of the purified pigments
are listed in Table 1.

MS/MS Analysis
of Prodiginine and Its Derivatives
The
six purified compounds were analyzed by ESI-MS/MS to determine the
molecular ions and fragment ions. The full Q1 scan mass spectrum of
peak #3 showed a molecular ion at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 322.4 [M + H]+ (Figure 5A, left). Further
study of the product ion scan mass spectrum with a CE of −20
V showed a molecular ion at m/z 322.2
[M + H]+ and product ions at m/z 307.2 [M – 15]+ and 147.2 [M –
175]+ (Figure 5A, right), indicating loss of a methyl group [CH3] and C10H9N2O, respectively. The
UV–Vis absorption (Figure 4) and mass (Figure 5A) spectra obtained for purified peak #3 were consistent
with those of the cycloprodigiosins reported by Gerber and Gauthier25 and Lee et al.,33 which include an immunosuppressant,34 anticancer compound,35 and antimalarial
drug.36 Next, a major compound, peak #4,
was analyzed by mass spectrometry (Figure 5B). The mass spectra from the Q1 scan showed
a molecular ion at m/z 324.4 [M
+ H]+ and two product ions at m/z 252.2 [M – 72]+ and 309.2 [M –
15]+ (Figure 5B, right). Comparison of the molecular and product ions with those
of standard prodigiosin hydrochloride revealed the same mass spectra
(Figure S4, Supporting Information). The
mass spectra and absorption maxima of the purified sample were consistent
with those of prodigiosin (2-methyl-3-pentyl-prodiginine).33 Therefore, the major compound, peak #4 at 2.52
min, was identified as prodigiosin. Based on the molecular ion and
product ions, peaks #5 and #6 were identified as 2-methyl-3-hexyl-prodiginine
(m/z 338.5 [M + H]+)
(Figure 5C) and 2-methyl-3-heptyl-prodiginine
(m/z 352.5 [M + H]+)
(Figure 5D), respectively,
which were also reported in the marine bacterium Hahella
chejuensis KCTC 2396.37,38 The minor compounds, peaks #1 and #2, respectively,
were identified as 2-methyl-3-propyl prodiginine (m/z 296.1 [M + H]+) and 2-methyl-3-butyl
prodiginine (m/z 310.2 [M + H]+) (Figure S5, Supporting Information),
respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the presence
of four derivatives of prodigiosin with different alkyl side chains
in P. rubra in addition to prodigiosin
and cycloprodigiosin. These findings largely rely on recently developed
MS techniques, such as single ion monitoring (SIM) and MRM, which
are based on the selection of a precursor ion and one or more characteristic
fragment ions and are powerful tools for determining the structure
of target compounds.

and product ion scan (right) mass spectra of (A) cycloprodigiosin,
(B) prodigiosin, (C) 2-methyl-3-hexyl-prodiginine, and (D) 2-methyl-3-heptyl-prodiginine.

In this study, MS analysis was carried out in positive
mode, and
product ions were almost all obtained at a CE of −20 V. Interestingly,
prodigiosin and its analogs showed similar fragmentations, with losses
of a methyl group at m/z [M –
15]+ and alkyl chains at m/z [M – 44]+, [M – 58]+, [M –
72]+, [M – 86]+, and [M – 100]+, respectively, for compounds containing propyl, butyl, pentyl,
hexyl, and heptyl side chains (Figure 5 and Figure S5). The complete
alkyl chains were lost as shown in agreement to the previously studies
by Wang et al. and Lee et al.26,33 The complete alkyl
chain might be removed due to strong ESI ionization technique from
the prodigiosins compound instead remains as allylic carbocation such
as benzylic ions. To obtain candidate product ions, we conducted MRM
to determine the optimum CE (Table 1). At a CE of −33 V, an additional product ion
was found for cycloprodigiosin at m/z 292.15 [M – 30]+, indicating loss of a methyl
group and one oxygen atom [CH3 + O – H]+. Additionally, the product ion at m/z 92 that was found for prodigiosin and its derivatives with different
alkyl chain sides due to loss of cyclopentadienecarbonitrile [C6H5N2 + H]+ was obtained at
a CE of −51 to −53 V. The optimal CE for the loss of
methyl and alkyl groups was −23 to −25 V and −33
to −34 V, respectively. Thus, the CE is a key factor, and the
MRM method used in this study to determine the optimum CE is ideal
for analyzing candidate product ions (Figure 6).

molecules at
different CEs based on optimized product ions using MRM. For the optimum
CE values, see Table 1. 1, 2-methyl-3-propyl prodiginine; 2,

compared to the standard antibiotic amoxicillin, ampicillin, and chloramphenicol
are presented in Table 2 and Figure 7.

As shown in Table 2, cycloprodigiosin, prodigiosin, and 2-methyl-3-hexyl
prodiginine
exhibited antimicrobial activity against all tested pathogenic organisms.
The inhibition zone varied from 9.0 to 10.5 mm when applied to E. coli. A smaller clear zone of 8.1–8.5 mm
was obtained against S. typhi. An interesting
result was obtained when the pigments were applied to S. aureus: a significant inhibition zone from 10.1
to 25.1 mm. In this case, cycloprodigiosin showed greater activity
than prodigiosin and 2-methyl-3-hexyl prodiginine. The pigments also
showed antifungal activity (7.9–8.2 mm) against C. albicans. There was no clear zone in the negative
control (DMSO). However, the positive controls amoxicillin, ampicillin,
and chloramphenicol demonstrated susceptibility to E. coli, S. typhi,
and S. aureus. On the other hand, C. albicans was resistant to all antibiotics with
resulting inhibition zone only around 8.3–8.6 mm. The bioactivities
of cycloprodigiosin and prodigiosin from the marine bacterium Zooshikella rubidus S1-1 have been studied by Lee
et al.33 Disks containing 50 μg of
these compounds produced an inhibition zone of approximately 8.0 mm
against Salmonella typhimurium, S. aureus, E. coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Candida albicans.33 Another
experiment by Lapenda et al.9 showed that
300 μg of prodigiosin from Serratia marcescens produced significant inhibition zones against S.
aureus (35 mm), Enterococcus faecalis (22 mm), and Streptococcus pyogenes (14 mm). However, no inhibition zones were found against E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Acenitobacter.9 In
our case, cycloprodigiosin, prodigiosin, and 2-methyl-3-hexyl prodiginine
at a concentration of 20 μg/mL caused clear zones around the
disks, suggesting that these compounds are sensitive to E. coli, S. typhi, S. aureus, and C. albicans. Bioactive prodiginine-producing marine bacteria comprise a wide
variety of genera, including Beneckea,38Pseudovibrio,39Vibrio,40−42,59Streptomyces,5,43−45,60Pseudomonas,46Pseudoalteromonas,21,23,26,47Hahella,48,49,58 and Zooshikella.33,50,51 However, the prodiginine
types and composition differ among them, as shown in Table S2, Supporting Information. Our isolated bacteria, P. rubra strains PS1 and SB14, are included in one
of these genera. Pseudoalteromonas species appear
to have a wide habitat, as described above. As shown in this study,
strains of P. rubra can be easily isolated
from a variety of marine environments and cultured by standard manipulation
techniques; therefore, they might be a potential source for the production
of bioactive prodigiosin and its derivatives.

Experimental
Section
Sampling Location
Sampling was conducted on Alor Island,
Eastern Indonesia. It is a tropical island located on the eastern
tip of the Nusa Tenggara Islands at 8°15′S and 124°45′E.
The island is bordered by the Flores Sea and the Banda Sea in the
north, the Ombai Strait in the south (separating it from Timor Island),
and the Pantar Strait in the west. Alor Island is one of the two main
islands in the Alor Regency, East Nusa Tenggara Province, Indonesia.
Two isolated strains were collected from two different locations with
different ecosystems: Sika Island coast and Sebanjar Beach (Figure 1). Seawater was sampled
in the surface and the bottom layer (depths of 0 and 6 m). Samples
were collected in 50 mL sterile tubes and placed in a cold box immediately.
Samples were then brought to the Ma Chung Research Center for Photosynthetic
Pigments for bacterial isolation. A map of sampling locations was
created using QGIS version 2.18.19 and the ESRI continent base map.

Bacterial Isolation and Purification
Up to 35 μL
of seawater was spread directly into Petri dishes containing Zobell
agar medium (0.5 g of yeast, 2.5 g of peptone, and 13 g of Bacto agar
in 1 L of seawater) and incubated for 3 days at 35 °C. After
3 days of incubation, the bacterial colonies on the Petri dishes were
observed. The red pigmented bacterium was purified by the streak plate
method and cultured in new medium for 3 days at 32 °C. Purification
of the pigmented bacterium was based on its color, shape, margin,
elevation, and size. The purification was performed repeatedly until
the colony was pure. The pure bacterium was then stored at 10 °C
until further study.

Bacterial Culture
The pure bacterium
was cultured on
the same medium as that used in the bacterial isolation. However,
the culturing was carried out in a shaking incubator (New Brunswick
Scientific Excella E24, Edison, NJ, USA) at 32 °C for 24 h. Red
pigment production is very rapid. After 24 h, the pigment begins to
fade. The cells of the bacterium were scraped, collected, and placed
in 25 mL plastic tubes and then precipitated by centrifugation at
10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the collected cells were stored
in a freezer at −30 °C until use.

DNA Extraction
DNA extraction was carried out by the
Chelex method.52 The bacterial cells were
inoculated into a mixture of 100 μL of ddH2O and
1 mL of 0.5% saponin (w/v) in 1× PBS and incubated overnight.
The precipitate was separated and collected by centrifugation at 12,000
rpm for 10 min. Subsequently, 100 μL of ddH2O and
50 μL of 20% Chelex 100 (w/v) were mixed until the precipitate
dissolved. The resulting solution was boiled for 10 min and vortexed
for 5 min. Then, the mixture containing bacterial DNA was centrifuged
at 12,000 rpm for 10 min and stored at −20 °C until use.
The bacterial DNA concentrations were quantified and qualified by
a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts,
USA). The concentration of 1 μL of DNA was analyzed, and the
DNA purity was calculated as the 260/280 nm ratio.

PCR Amplification
of the 16S rRNA Gene Sequence
The
universal primers 27F (5′-AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3′) and
1492R (5′-TACGGTTAACCTTGTTACGACTT-3′) in a PCR mixture
were used in this study. For analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences,
GoTaq Green Mix Promega (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, USA) (25 μL)
was used to amplify DNA. The PCR mixture consisted of GoTaq Green
Master Mix Promega (25 μL), primer 27F (0.5–5 μL),
primer 1492R (0.5–5 μL), DNA extract (1–5 μL),
and nuclease-free water (50 μL). PCR was conducted in an MJ
Mini Personal Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, California, USA).
The cycling conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 95
°C for 3 min followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C
for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72
°C for 1 min. The final extension was carried out at 72 °C
for 7 min.53 The PCR products were analyzed
using agarose 0.8% gel electrophoresis, and the results were visualized
by a UVIDoc HD5 system (UVITEC, Cambridge, UK). The amount of DNA
ladder per lane and the sample volume loaded per lane were 0.2 μg
and 1 μL, respectively.

DNA Sequencing
DNA sequencing was performed using a
QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany), and PCR sequencing
was performed using Big Dye Terminator v.3.1. The sequencing analysis
was carried out using an ABI 3130XL system (Applied Biosystem, Carlsbad,
California, USA). The sequencing data for the amplified 16S rRNA genes
from each bacterium were deposited in the GenBank database of the
NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). The sequencing data were inserted into the Advanced BLAST search
program to identify the sequences of any closely related organisms.
The 16S rRNA sequencing data of the bacteria were also deposited in
the DDBJ.

Phylogenetic Analysis
The results of DNA sequencing
were aligned using ClustalW Multiple Alignment. MEGA 6 software was
used for phylogenetic analysis. The phylogenetic trees were determined
by the neighbor-joining method with Kimura’s two-parameter
model. The tree topology was evaluated by bootstrap analysis of the
neighbor-joining method based on 1000 resamplings.54

Pigment Extraction
The collected
cells were homogenized
in a mixture of methanol and acetone (7:3, v/v, 1 mL of mixture per
0.1 g of cells) by vortexing five times (1 min of vortexing, 1 min
on ice) and then disrupted by sonication in pulse mode with 60% amplitude
and 10 s on/30 s off for 10 min (QSonica, Newtown, Connecticut, USA).
A few grains of CaCO3 and sodium ascorbate were added to
the mixture to prevent pigment degradation via oxidation. The pigment
extract was separated from the cell debris by centrifugation at 19,230g for 5 min at 4 °C (Kubota 6500 centrifuge, Tokyo,
Japan). The resulting extract was collected and dried using a rotary
evaporator at 100 rpm and 35 °C in a water bath (Heidolph Laborota
4010 digital, Schwabach, Germany). The dried pigment extract was stored
at −30 °C until use.

Spectrophotometric Analysis
The UV–Vis absorption
spectra of crude pigment extracts were recorded by a UV–Vis
1700 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Methanol was used
for background subtraction in all measurements. The dried pigment
extract was diluted in methanol and measured at a wavelength (λ)
of 200–1100 nm. Subsequently, the obtained data were analyzed
using OriginPro 8.5.1 software (OriginLab, Northampton, Massachusetts,
USA).

HPLC Analysis and Purification of Prodiginines and Their Derivatives
The pigments were separated and purified by preparative HPLC (Shimadzu
preparative UFLC, Kyoto, Japan) and analyzed by analytical HPLC (Shimadzu
analytical-UFLC, Kyoto, Japan) using a Symmetry C8 column
(150 × 4.6 mm, 3.5 μm particle size, 100 Å pore size)
(Waters, Milford, MA, USA). The HPLC-grade solvents (MERCK, Darmstadt,
Germany) were degassed for 5 min with ultrasonication prior to use.
The mobile phases used consisted of two solvents. Solvent A was methanol
(MeOH), and solvent B was 1% formic acid in water (H2O).
The elution gradient was 70% A for min 0–2, 85% A for min 2–4,
and 100% A for or min 4–10. The flow rate was 1 mL/min with
a column oven temperature of 29 °C. The pigments were detected
with a diode array detector (Shimadzu SPD M20A, 190–800 nm)
at λ 530 nm. The prodigiosin pigment standard (from Serratia marcescens, >98% purity, CAS number:
56144-17-3)
was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (MERCK).

MS/MS Analysis
The highly purified compounds (>97%
purity) were analyzed by ESI-MS with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer
(LCMS-8030, Shimadzu). Determination of the pigments was based on
their MS data and spectral properties. The simple MS method was used
with isocratic HPLC elution by 0.1% formic acid in a mixture of methanol
(90%) and water (10%) for 2 min at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min without
a column. The DL temperature was 200 °C, the nebulizing gas flow
rate was 3 L/min, the heat block temperature was 350 °C, the
drying gas flow rate was 15 L/min, the column oven temperature was
30 °C, and the cooler temperature was 5 °C. Prodiginine
was detected at a wavelength (λ) of 530 nm. The initial identification
of precursor ions was conducted by using a Q1Q3 scan in positive and
negative modes at m/z 50 to 600
using an event time of 0.1 s and a scan speed of 6000 u/s. The precursor
ions were then fragmented in product ion scan mode by using various
CEs. Pigment identification was based on the molecular mass of the
precursor from the Q1Q3 scan and the product ions and on the product
ions optimized by the MRM method. Identification of the pure compounds
was performed according to the precursor ion, product ions, and SIM
data. The chemical structures of the identified compounds were drawn
using ChemDraw software version 12.0.2 (PerkinElmer, Inc., Massachusetts,
USA).

Pigment Identification
The pigments were identified
by HPLC and MS/MS analyses based on the chromatographic, that is,
retention time (tR); spectrophotometric,
that is, spectral shape and maximal absorption wavelength (λmax); and mass, that is, precursor and fragment ions, properties
compared to those of reference compounds.21,23,25,33,36,50 The prodigiosin in P. rubra PS1 and SB14 was compared to a prodigiosin
standard (Sigma-Aldrich, MERCK). The data consisted of a full Q1 scan
and product ion scans at the optimized CE of the prodigiosin standard
in the LabSolution MS Library (Shimadzu). The prodigiosin from P. rubra PS1 and SB14 was isolated and purified to
>97% purity. Then, the isolated prodigiosin was identified by comparison
of the recorded chromatographic and spectral data with the data on
the prodigiosin standard stored in the library using LabSolution LCMS
version 5.4 (Shimadzu). The software compared retention times and
aligned MS/MS data to calculate a match factor and produced a degree
of similarity between spectra. Cycloprodigiosin, 2-methyl-3-propyl
prodiginine, 2-methyl-3-butyl prodiginine, 2-methyl-3-hexyl-prodiginine,
and 2-methyl-3-heptyl-prodiginine were analyzed on the basis of MS
and fragmentation data.

Antimicrobial Activity
The antimicrobial
activity was
determined by the disk-diffusion technique according to the Kirby-Bauer
disk diffusion susceptibility test protocol.55 Prodigiosin, cycloprodigiosin, and 2-methyl-3-hexyl prodiginine
were used as antimicrobial agents against three pathogenic bacteria: Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Staphylococcus
aureus ATCC 6538, Salmonella typhi, from clinical isolation and one pathogenic yeast, Candida albicans ATCC 10231. Briefly, 90 mm dishes
were filled with 15 mL of Mueller-Hinton agar (MHA) to a depth of
4 mm for bacteria and Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) for yeast. The
pathogenic microorganisms were swabbed on the dishes following the
McFarland turbidity standard (0.5) using sterile cotton swabs. Blank
disks were placed on the surface of the medium, and each antimicrobial
agent (20 μg/mL) was injected into the disks. DMSO was used
as a negative control. Ten micrograms of amoxicillin, ampicillin,
and chloramphenicol were applied as positive controls. Dishes were
inverted and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The inhibition zone
surrounding disks was measured, as was the disk diameter. The prodigiosin
concentration was determined by absorption in acidified ethanol (4%
v/v of 1 N HCl) with a molar extinction coefficient ε535 of 139,800 ± 5100 M–1 cm–1.56,57
