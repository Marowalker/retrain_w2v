We report a biocidal zombie effect of chlorhexidine,
a wide-scope
biocidal agent commonly used in disinfectant and antiseptic formulations.
The zombie effect refers to the ability of dead bacteria killed by
a biocidal agent to act as efficient biocidal agents toward a new
generation of viable bacteria. The killed bacteria serve as a reservoir
for the antibacterial agent incorporated within them; and the new
viable population of bacteria acts as a trap of the bioactive agent,
shifting the equilibrium of this agent between the reservoir in the
dead cells and their aqueous environment. This report is a major generalization
of the zombie phenomenon reported previously for silver from the points
of view of extending to organic antibacterial agents; extending the
effect to both Gram-negative—Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1—and Gram positive—Staphylococcus
aureus—representative bacteria; showing that
the zombie effect is maintained in the second and third generations;
showing the effect to operate in an environment of growth media, which
extends it to life-supporting environments; and proving that cross-killing
is possible, that is, killed S. aureus cells fully inactivated viable P. aeruginosa.

Introduction
In a previous report,1 we have introduced
a new mechanism of the activity of antimicrobial agents, which we
denoted as the “zombie effect”, wherein biocidally killed
bacteria are capable of inactivating viable bacterial cells by serving
as active reservoirs of the accumulated biocidal agent that originally
inactivated them. Specifically, the concept was demonstrated by showing
the high bactericidal action of silver nitrate-killed Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells toward a viable culture
of the same strain. In the underling mechanism of the effect, we proposed
that the silver ions undergo complexation and partial reduction to
metallic silver within the bacterial cells. When new viable bacterial
cells are introduced into the system, an equilibrium shift occurs,
which causes silver ions to be released from the killed bacteria and
inactivate the viable cells. Here, we further develop this new concept
in five aspects, which greatly extend the silver zombie report: first,
we show the generality of the phenomenon by testing the zombie effect
with an entirely different antibacterial agent—the organic
molecule chlorhexidine digluconate (CH). Second, we show that representatives
of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, P.
aeruginosa PAO1 and Staphylococcus
aureus ATTC 29213, which were killed by this agent,
revealed strong zombie biocidal activities. Third, we examine and
prove the feasibility of the effect in growth media, which potentially
extends the effect to life supporting environments. Fourth, we show
that the zombie effect is carried to a second and third “generation”
of zombies. And fifth, we prove that cross-killing is possible, that
is, CH-killed S. aureus cells fully
inactivate viable P. aeruginosa.

The zombie cell effect was induced as described below in Experimental Section. In brief, the deadly zombie
cells were produced by inactivating a ca. 108 colony forming
unit (CFU)/mL of either P. aeruginosa or S. aureus with 20.0 ppm CH in
a HEPES buffered solution for 3 h. Then, the zombie cells were carefully
removed from the solution by centrifugation and resuspended in a solution
to which a viable cell population of bacteria was added, after which
the bacterial viability was evaluated. The CH concentration for the
preparation of the zombie cells was chosen as the minimal concentration,
exerting a kill of at least 99.999% in the bacterial population. In
practical perspective, clinical formulations of CH are 25 times more
concentrated than the solution used in the zombie cell experiment
described here.

Results and Discussion
The antibacterial effect of
CH-killed Gram-negative P. aeruginosa toward a viable population of the same
bacterium is presented in Figure 1. It is seen that starting off with ca. 108 CFU/mL, the CH-killed cells are capable of reducing 5.4 orders of
magnitude of the new bacterial population (i.e., 99.999% kill). This
demonstrates that the zombie effect is not limited to inorganic silver
for which it was first discovered1 but
has more general features, encompassing even organic biocidal molecules. Figure 1 also shows that
the zombie antibacterial effect can be transmitted from one dead generation
to the next: separating the generation of the zombie-killed bacteria
cells from the solution and applying them to a freshly prepared 108 CFU/mL population resulted in a reduction of approximately
2 orders of magnitude in viability; and similarly, repeating the process
with the second generation zombies and applying them onto a third
population results in a similar viability reduction of ∼2 orders
of magnitude. It should be noted, though, that the potency of the
antibacterial action of the second and the third generation of zombie
is more pronounced when testing them against a lower inoculum of 106 CFU/mL (Figure 1, orange column), an inoculum typically used in antibacterial efficacy
evaluations, which led to total eradication of the bacteria. These
results show that the antibacterial activity of the CH molecules is
retained after the inactivation process, and that CH can accumulate
in the dead cells, which in turn provides an available source for
further bactericidal action against viable cells. Bearing in mind
that the amount of CH in the system is limited, there should be a
limit to the number of times that the process can be repeated. Indeed,
after the third cycle, the killing effect is terminated.

activity of three zombie-cell generations is shown in blue. Orange:

Applying the same methodology on a different bacterium—Gram-positive S. aureus ATTC 29213 bacteria—resulted in
a similar antibacterial effect (Figure 2, blue column): CH-killed S. aureus zombies were capable of reducing 3.6 orders of magnitudes in the
bacterial viability. This implies that the zombie phenomenon is a
general trait at least in regard to bacterial Gram types. In fact,
having CH-P. aeruginosa zombies more active than
CH-S. aureus zombies is consistent
with the relative potency of CH toward the two strains examined separately,
wherein S. aureus showed more tolerance
toward CH (a reduction of 6.8 out of 8.0 orders of magnitude in the
viability) in comparison to a complete (8 orders of magnitude) eradication
of P. aeruginosa. Next, obtaining two
different bacterial strains of CH-zombies led to the possibility of
testing cross-killing, in which one bacterial strain is inactivated
by zombie cells of a second strain. And so, CH-killed S. aureus cells were added to a suspension of 106 viable P. aeruginosa cells:
full inactivation of bacterial viability was observed (Figure 2, orange column), which strengthens
the notion that the zombies effect is not limited to cells of one
particular bacterial strain but is most probably relevant to any type
of bacteria. It is worthwhile mentioning that the cell morphology
and its mode of grouping are important parameters influencing on the
interaction of CH with it and its adsorption characteristics. The
bacteria for which the zombie effect is shown here differ greatly
in these parameters: P. aeruginosa is
characterized with rode-shaped and singled cells whereas S. aureus is characterized with spherical clustered
cell.

of P. aeruginosa.

It is also of relevance to examine the zombie effect
in life-supporting
environments that promote bacterial proliferation. This was carried
out by resuspending the CH-killed P. aeruginosa bacteria in a Luria–Bertani (LB) broth, a standard growth
medium which was used also to cultivate a viable culture of the same
bacterium (Figure 3). As can be seen, the bacterial growth is completely inhibited from
time zero. This observation points to the possibility of having an
active zombie effect in wound environments treated with CH;2,3 in fact, it may account for its known prolonged antimicrobial activity
including in the presence of blood and bio-organic components.4,5

For the zombie effect to operate, the biocidal
agent should be
such that its killing action is not accompanied by deactivation (metabolic
or physicochemical), or that such deactivation is slow; and that its
molecules should adsorb and chemisorb to the bacterial cell components.
This is crucial for the transfer of CH from the zombie reservoir upon
exposure to an adsorptive target which is empty, that is, the next
generation of living bacteria to be eradicated; the adsorption equilibrium
established in the dead bacteria will be shifted toward the adsorption
sites of the living bacteria, following Le-Chatelier’s principle
of equilibria shifts. We, therefore, investigated the adsorption characteristics
of CH onto the bacterial cells which determine the basic conditions
for the attachment/release of CH to and from the bacterial cells.
CH is a cationic molecule (Figure 4 inset) exerting a bacteriostatic effect at low concentrations
and bactericidal effect at higher concentrations, by targeting various
anionic sites such as phosphate groups present on the surface of the
bacterial cell, specifically in the peptidoglycan layers of the bacterial
cell wall, thus disrupting the cell envelope permeability, which then
leads to inactivation.6,7Figure 3 plots the adsorption isotherm of CH onto
bacterial cells of P. aeruginosa in
HEPES buffer, by monitoring the CH concentration which remains in
the solution at equilibrium with the adsorbed CH. The experimental
data showed an excellent fit (r2 = 0.97)
with Langmuir’s adsorption isotherm equation (eq 1) 1  Here, [CH]ads is the concentration
of the adsorbed CH at equilibrium, [CH]max is the maximum
coverage concentration at equilibrium, K is Langmuir’s
constant (the adsorption equilibrium constant), and Ceq is the measured concentration of CH in the solution
at equilibrium. The fitting provided a maximum loading concentration
of 15.2 ± 0.5 ppm per 109 cells and a Langmuir constant
of 0.83 ± 0.20 ppm–1. The fit to Langmuir’s
model indicates indeed that the antibacterial effect of the zombie
cell stems from strongly adsorbed CH molecules, which in our case
results from the interaction of the dicationic sites of CH with negative
moieties on the surface of bacteria (such as phosphate groups) thus
forming strong ionic bonds. Note that this maximal loading value,
translates to ∼1.8 × 108 molecules per one
cell. It should be noted that because the adsorption sites are heterogeneous,
the Langmuir constant represents an apparent average adsorption equilibrium
constant.8 In summary then, the zombie
effect has three main stages 2   3   4  Here, reaction 2 is the
formation of the CH reservoir within the dead bacteria; in 3, a Langmuir-type adsorption equilibrium is established;
in 4 the equilibrium 3 is shifted to the new batch of viable cells, killing it; and as
shown above, the second generation of zombies, and even the third
one, can repeat this cycle.

aeruginosa cells in HEPES buffer and the fit to Langmuir’s
equation.

Whereas the adsorption isotherm experiment represents
equilibrium
points between the CH in the solution and the adsorbed CH, it was
also of interest to examine the total extraction of CH from the cells.
This can be achieved with methanol, which is able to efficiently release
all the CH initially applied to the bacterial population. Figure 5 summarizes the extraction
experiment and shows the % of CH extracted with HEPES buffered solution
from the total amount extracted with MeOH as a function of the CH
exposure concentration of the viable cells. It is seen that, at all
exposure concentrations, the buffered HEPES solution is capable of
extracting only a portion of the adsorbed CH, thus creating the equilibrium
conditions, while the release into MeOH represents the potential available
amount of CH to be released by the zombie cells in open systems such
as a fresh wound. This extraction also provides an important proof
that, under the zombie experiment conditions, the CH molecules remain
intact upon interaction with the bacterial cells—the spectrum
of the extract is identical to that of pure CH solution (Figure 5, inset). That is,
when the equilibrium is shifted and the CH molecules detach from the
dead cells and interact with new viable cells, their biocidal activity
is, in principle, unchanged.

Figure 5 Extraction of CH from CH-killed P. aeruginosa: extraction percentage with HEPES from
the total extraction with
MeOH as a function of the CH exposure concentration of the viable
cells. Inset: CH remains intact after its killing action, ready to
kill by its release from the dead cells.

We have thus shown the generality of the recently
introduced zombies’
phenomenon wherein an equilibrium shift leads to a release of an antibacterial
agent from the killed bacterial cells. The equilibrium shift is the
result of the presence of adsorptive target sites in the new viable
cells of the same bacterial strain, or of a different bacterial strain.
It is important to note that the effect is probably relevant in general
to persistent antibacterial agents of which activity is not affected
by the killing action or by the environment within which they operate.
As the effect was shown to exist in both static nonreplicating and
in growing bacteria, it should, in principle, play a role in the activity
of high-persistent, strongly attached antimicrobial agents applied
to living tissues, including local and systemic antibiotics.

Finally, an outlook: the observation of the cross-killing zombie
effect leads to a more general concept of utilizing inactivated safe
bacterial cells as inert biological carriers for bioactive molecules
and for their sustained release. Whereas drug delivery systems are
constantly being developed for the benefit of improving product efficacy,
safety, and patient compliance, the use of inactivated bacterial cells
as biological delivery systems, to best of our knowledge, have not
been described yet. Zombie cells of safe bacteria should not, in principle,
impose a toxic reaction on human cells as they are fully inactivated
and do not produce toxins. Likewise, they should not accumulate in
the body as they are bio-degradable. Related studies on “bacterial-ghosts”,9 which are bacterial cell envelopes devoid of
any cytoplasmic content that are derived from Gram-negative bacteria,
showed that non-living bacterial envelopes can be used as efficient
delivery systems for drugs,10 nucleic acids,11 pesticides, enzymes, and as intrinsic adjuvant
antigen carrier vaccines;12 we believe
that dead cells have a similar potential, with the advantage that
various cell components can be used for a wide range of interactions
with various useful medical payloads.

Bacteria
Wild-type P. aeruginosa PAO1 strain and S. aureus ATCC 29213
were kindly provided by Prof. E. Banin, Bar-Ilan University, Israel
and by Prof. M. Reches, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, respectively.

Preparation of CH-Killed Bacterial Cells
An overnight
grown culture of P. aeruginosa PAO
1 (90 mL) in LB medium at 37 °C was harvested by centrifugation
(10 min, 4500 rpm, at RT), washed three times with 30 mL of HEPES
buffer (30 mL, 40.0 mM, pH 7.4), and diluted with the same medium
to a suspension of 1 × 109 cells/mL. The appropriate
dilution factor was determined by diluting the bacterial culture to
an optical density (OD590) of 0.3, corresponding to 1 ×
108 cells/mL. Bacterial suspension (1.0 mL) and 1.0 mL
of CH 200.0 mM solution were added to 8.0 mL HEPES buffered solution,
resulting in 1 × 108 cells/mL and CH concentration
of 20.0 ppm. The bacterial solution was mixed in an incubated shaker
at 30 °C for 3 h. Then, the CH-killed bacterial suspension (of
which the kill was ensured following the procedure described below)
was centrifuged (10 min, 4800 rpm, RT), and the pellets were carefully
removed from the solution. To ensure 99.9999% kill in the original
bacterial suspension, a 0.8 mL sample of the solution was diluted
1:1 with a neutralizing solution (0.2% w/w sodium thioglycolate, 1.9%
w/w sodium thiosulfate, 1% w/w Tween 80, 1.4% w/w lecithin) for 5
min. After neutralization, the samples were serially diluted (10 fold)
with saline solution (8.5% w/w NaCl) and spread-plated on nutrient
agar Petri plates. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 48
h, and the bacterial colonies were enumerated. CH-killed S. aureus ATCC 29213 cells were obtained in similar
manner as described for P. aeruginosa, by replacing the nutrient broth, and the nutrient agar with TSB
and TSA, respectively.

Evaluating the Bactericidal Efficacy of the CH-Killed Bacteria
(I) The general test: A pellet of the CH-killed cells was suspended
in 9.0 mL of HEPES. 1.0 mL sample of a fresh 1 × 109 cell/mL bacterial suspension, (obtained by the procedure described
above), was added to the CH-killed cells, and the obtained suspension
was mixed in an incubated shaker at 30 °C for 24 h. Then, 0.8
mL aliquots from the bacterial suspensions were neutralized, serially
diluted, spread-plated, incubated, and enumerated as described above.
The bactericidal experiments were repeated two to three times, and
the results are presented as mean log reduction values, log(Nt/N0), where Nt is the bacterial
concentration at time t and N0 is the bacterial concentration at time zero.

(II) Bactericidal
tests of the second and the third generation killed bacteria. These
were carried out by separating the formally killed cells from the
solution by centrifugation (10 min, 4500 rpm at RT), resuspension
of the resulted pellet in HEPES buffer to which a new bacterial suspension
of either 1 × 108 or 1 × 106 viable
cells/mL, and incubating and enumerating as described in above.

(III) Cross-killing of P. aeruginosa by CH-killed S. aureus bacteria.
The cross-killing experiment was carried out in a similar procedure
by applying the CH-killed S. aureus cells to a viable P. aeruginosa suspension
cell of 1 × 106 cells/mL.

Evaluating the Bactericidal Efficacy of the CH-Killed Bacteria
in a Growth Medium
A CH-killed P. aeruginosa cell pellet was resuspended in 250 μL of LB broth and transferred
to a plastic cuvette. A 0.3 mL aliquot of an overnight culture P. aeruginosa in LB was harvested into 30 mL of fresh
LB and was grown to OD590 of 0.1. 3.0 mL of the growing
cell suspension was added to the cuvette, and the optical density
of the mix was followed at 590 nm. Readings were taken every 10 min
for a total of 2 h. As a control, 250 μL of LB broth was added
to 3.0 mL of the growing cells suspension, and the OD of the suspension
was monitored accordingly.

Adsorption of CH onto Bacterial Cells
A viable bacterial
suspension of P. aeruginosa in HEPES
buffer at OD of 3.0 was obtained from overnight cultures as described
above. 1.0 mL of the bacterial suspension and 1.0 mL of a CH solution
at increasing concentrations (50.0, 100.0, 150.0, 200.0, 250.0, 300.0,
400.0, and 500.0 ppm) were added to 8.0 mL of HEPES buffered solution.
The resulting suspensions were mixed at 30 °C for 3 h in an incubated
shaker. Then, the cells were separated from the solutions by centrifugation,
and the supernatants were filtered by 0.2 μm syringe filters.
The concentrations of CH in the filtered supernatant were measured
spectrophotometrically through its maximum absorbance at 254 nm. The
adsorbed concentrations were obtained by subtracting the measured
concentration in the cells supernatants from these in the control
CH solutions.

Extraction of CH from CH-Killed Bacteria
Extraction
experiments with HEPES and with methanol were performed by suspending
a pellet of CH-killed P. aeruginosa cells obtained as described above, in 10.0 mL of the extracting
solvent and stirring the suspension at 30 °C for 24 h in a shaker
incubator. Then, the suspension was centrifuged, the supernatant was
removed and filtered with a 0.2 μm syringe filter, and the CH
concentration was measured spectroscopically through its absorption
peak in the extracting solvent (254 nm in HEPES buffer and 260 nm
in methanol).
