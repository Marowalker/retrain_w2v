Gold nanoparticles
(AuNPs) and aptamers are compelling building
blocks for analytical assays with desired attributes of selectivity
and sensitivity and may theoretically form the basis of instrument-free
color-changing assays for any target against which a DNA aptamer has
been selected. However, assays for proteins based on these components
may be subject to significant interferences from the interaction of
proteins with nanoparticles. We found that for three representative
protein/aptamer systems—thrombin, apolipoprotein E, and platelet-derived
growth factor—pH-dependent aggregation occurred, even in the
absence of the aptamer, to differing extents. This effect is most
pronounced when proteins display net surface charge (i.e., when pH
< pI) but can even be observed at pH = pI when the protein retains
regions of positive charge. These interactions of AuNPs and cationic
regions on proteins may present an important limitation on the development
of AuNP-based analytical assays.

Introduction
As analytical scientists
continue to seek methods that are rapid,
sensitive, selective, and adaptable to diverse detection challenges
in a variety of resource-limited contexts, considerable effort has
been invested in the development of novel colorimetric assays.1−5 In particular, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are exploited in numerous
colorimetric assays developed in recent years.6−8 Owing to their
extremely high molar absorptivity (∼2 × 108 M–1 cm–1),9 AuNPs impart a color to solutions that is visible to the
naked eye at nanomolar concentrations. Furthermore, the aggregation
of AuNPs induces a shift in the surface plasmon resonance of the assembled
particles, leading to a dramatic, easily visible color change from
red to blue.10 AuNPs prepared via citrate
reduction are colloidal, dispersed by charge–charge repulsion
of citrate ions on their surfaces. Aggregation of AuNPs can be induced
by elevated salt concentrations that screen these surface charges.
However, AuNPs may remain dispersed at elevated salt concentrations
if they are coated with ssDNA.11,12 The mechanism and kinetics
of the interaction between ssDNA and AuNP have been extensively characterized.13 These phenomena have been exploited to develop
colorimetric biosensing assays for targets as diverse as dopamine,
mercury, and thrombin, wherein specific aptamer/target recognition
mediates the extent of salt-induced aggregation.14−16 The assay format
capitalizes on the fact that many well-characterized aptamers are
ssDNA and therefore stabilize AuNPs against salt-mediated aggregation. Figure 1 illustrates the
AuNP/aptamer assay format schematically.

Figure 1 Scheme of a simple aggregation
assay. (Top) AuNPs aggregate in
the presence of salts such as sodium chloride, resulting in a color
change from red to blue. (Middle) In the presence of a DNA aptamer
(blue lines), salt-induced aggregation is mitigated. (Bottom) Addition
of the aptamer’s target (green triangles) competes aptamers
off the AuNPs and restores salt-induced aggregation. The extent of
aggregation therefore indicates the concentration of the aptamer’s
target.

As a step toward developing an
instrument-free AuNP aggregation-based
assay for clinically relevant biomarker proteins using DNA aptamers
as molecular recognition elements, we attempted to reproduce the assay
protocol described in a highly cited foundational paper;16 namely, the detection of thrombin using an aggregation
mechanism mediated by a thrombin-specific aptamer. Wei et al. described a colorimetric assay for thrombin using unmodified
AuNPs and a high-affinity 29-mer thrombin aptamer selected by Tasset
and co-workers.17 As described in the Results and Discussion section, we find that under
the conditions described by Wei et al., thrombin causes AuNP aggregation
independent of the involvement of aptamers. We also find that this
mechanism operates to different extents for two other protein/aptamer
systems. This effect interferes with the straightforward implementation
and interpretation of this assay format unless experimental parameters
such as pH and ionic strength are well-controlled.

Results and Discussion
A detailed experimental protocol is found in the Experimental Section. Briefly, we synthesized ∼13 nm
AuNPs via the reduction of chloroauric acid by citrate.18 The average size, size distribution, shape,
and monodispersity of the resulting AuNPs were confirmed by transmission
electron microscopy (Supporting Information Figure 1), and the concentration was determined using measured absorbance
at 520 nm and a previously reported value of extinction coefficient.9 In separate tubes, 200 μL of AuNPs was
mixed with 30 μL of thrombin-binding aptamer (5 μM). Thrombin
(30 μL) at various concentrations was then added, and the mixture
was incubated at room temperature (RT) for 5 min, after which 100
μL of 0.3 M NaCl solution was added to induce aggregation. It
is worth noting that this salt concentration is lower than that reported
by Wei et al., who used a 0.5 M NaCl solution. In preliminary assays,
we observed that the addition of 0.5 M NaCl resulted in an extensive
nanoparticle aggregation at all thrombin concentrations; a lower salt
concentration was necessary to see any protein-concentration-dependent
response. Aggregation was assessed spectrophotometrically by the absorbance
ratio A620/A520, the ratio most reflective of the visible region changes in absorbance
(Supporting Information Figure 3). Aggregation
can also be quantified by examining the A720/A520 ratio if a spectrophotometer is
available; this ratio is more sensitive but lies outside the wavelength
range detectable by the eye. As shown in Figure 2 (black circles), the extent of salt-induced
aggregation increased with increasing thrombin concentration, ostensibly
consistent with the mechanism shown in Figure 1.

Figure 2 Salt-induced, thrombin-concentration-dependent
aggregation of AuNPs
occurs both in the presence of a thrombin-binding aptamer (black circles)
and of a scrambled sequence oligonucleotide of the same length (open
squares). Aggregation in the presence of a scrambled aptamer is not
predicted by the mechanism shown in Figure 1.

We performed a control experiment in which a 29-base ssDNA
oligomer
with a scrambled sequence was substituted for the thrombin-binding
aptamer. By contrast, with the expected negative result, we observed
aggregation in the presence of the scrambled sequence, which should
not have been driven off the nanoparticles by the presence of thrombin
(Figure 2, open squares).
Gel mobility shift assays confirmed that the 29-mer thrombin-binding
aptamer displayed high affinity for thrombin, whereas the scrambled
sequence did not bind thrombin (Supporting Information Figure 2). This observation, along with the positive result for
the negative control, suggested an alternative mechanism to that shown
in Figure 1. Aggregation
was not induced by buffer salts; the results of these control experiments
are shown in Figure 3. A proof-of-concept experiment was conducted without thrombin, in
which a stoichiometric amount of the aptamer was removed from the
solution (replaced by pH-adjusted water) corresponding to the concentrations
of thrombin used in the assays reported in Figure 2. This experiment showed that removal of
aptamer from the solution (such as would occur in the presence of
thrombin through the formation of the thrombin/aptamer complex) has
no effect on the state of aggregation of the AuNPs, again suggesting
that the aggregation previously reported in the presence of thrombin
does not result from the mechanism illustrated in Figure 1. By adjusting the concentrations
of aptamer and NaCl to diverge from the conditions reported by Wei
et al., we were able to produce the expected trend, confirming that
ssDNA confers protection against AuNP aggregation (data not shown).

Figure 3 AuNP aggregation
follows the same trend in the presence of a thrombin-binding
aptamer (solid circles) and a scrambled control oligonucleotide (open
circles) with increasing concentration of thrombin; addition of protein
buffer alone (squares) does not induce aggregation. Error bars are
standard deviation (n = 3).

To test whether thrombin alone has an aggregating effect
on AuNPs,
an experiment was conducted in which thrombin was added to AuNPs in
the absence of oligonucleotides and the addition of NaCl was omitted.
The result of this experiment, shown in Figure 4, demonstrates that under the assay conditions
reported by Wei et al. (with respect to the buffer composition and
AuNP/thrombin concentrations), thrombin itself acts as a coagulating
agent, inducing aggregation of citrate-stabilized AuNPs. In light
of this result and the observation that pH = 6 in the aforementioned
experiments, we hypothesized that proteins bearing a net positive
charge (at pH < pI) might be acting as cationic coagulating agents,
independent of the aptamer/protein interaction that ostensibly mediates
aggregation. This hypothesis motivated us to test three predictions:
for a given protein, the coagulating (aggregating) effect will be
strongest at pH < pI, reduced at pH = pI, and abrogated at pH >
pI. We selected two other proteins, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) (pI =
5.6) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) (pI = 9.4) because
their pI values (as determined by isoelectric focusing19) bracket that of thrombin (pI = 7.0–7.5).
PDGF, which carries the greatest positive surface charge, was predicted
to cause the greatest amount of aggregation, whereas ApoE, which carries
little if any positive charge, was predicted to cause the least. Each
protein was investigated for its ability to aggregate AuNPs at a pH
below, near, and above its pI. Buffer cation concentrations were identical
across all solutions. Results of these experiments are shown in Figure 5.

Figure 4 Thrombin induces aggregation
of AuNPs in a concentration-dependent
fashion (black triangles). Addition of an equivalent amount of a thrombin
buffer (without thrombin) does not induce aggregation of AuNPs, indicating
that the aggregation induced by thrombin is protein-mediated and not
caused by the addition of buffer components. No oligonucleotides were
present in these samples, and no NaCl was added to induce aggregation.
Error bars are standard deviation (n = 3).

Figure 5 AuNP aggregation (indicated by A620/A520) as a function of
protein concentration
for ApoE (left), thrombin (middle), and PDGF-BB (right). Each protein
was studied at three pH values: below pI (solid squares), near pI
(open circles), and above pI (solid diamonds). Protein samples are
shown with solid lines; buffer blanks are shown with dashed lines.
Error bars are standard deviation (n = 3).

ApoE and thrombin produced results
that supported our hypothesis,
with increasing protein concentrations corresponding to increasing
aggregation. Additionally, as predicted, aggregation decreased with
decreasing pH. Thrombin causes more aggregation than an equal concentration
of ApoE at an identical pH. On the other hand, PDGF, which was predicted
to cause the greatest amount of AuNP aggregation, causes the least
amount of aggregation of the three proteins tested, though aggregation
is greatest at the lowest pH. It is difficult to rationalize why PDGF
behaves in this manner. It may be that protein denaturation and interaction
with the gold surface counteract the screening effect of cationic
proteins. Cysteine residues accessible on the protein surface can
immobilize proteins on gold surfaces through gold/thiol interactions.
A UniProt Blast search (accessed July 3, 2017) shows that ApoE contains
two cysteines; thrombin (peptidase S1) contains 6 cysteines; and one
B subunit of PDGF contains 11 cysteines (so that our protein, PDGF-BB,
contains 22 cysteines). Crystal structures from the Protein Data Bank
(PDB) (1K21 and 1PDG; accessed July 30, 2017) suggest that thrombin
contains three disulfide bonds, leaving no cysteine residues available
for direct interaction with the gold surface. At the same time, the
PDB structure suggests that PDGF contains eight intramolecular disulfide
bonds, so that six cysteine residues may be reduced and available
for interaction. The larger number of cysteine residues in PDGF and
the larger number of these residues not involved in disulfide bonds
are consistent with the hypothesis that gold/thiol interactions keep
the AuNPs stable as colloids but are not proof that this is the operative
mechanism. At the same time, the gold surface is able to interact
with many amino acid side chains (anything containing heteroatoms
that can act as electron-pair donors). We have not conclusively determined
the origin of the unexpected trend observed for PDGF in these assays;
more assays with proteins containing different numbers of cysteine
residues under both oxidizing and reducing conditions will need to
be performed to further substantiate or disprove this possible mechanism.

Other investigators have reported that some biological molecules
aggregate AuNPs. Katayama and co-workers20 studied coagulation (their preferred term for aggregation) induced
by a variety of biological molecules. They report that cationic biomolecules,
including a +3 cationic peptide, spermidine (an oligoamine bearing
a +3 charge), and lysozyme (a basic protein), induced aggregation,
whereas bovine serum albumin (BSA) (an acidic protein) did not. Li
and co-workers21 also observed that lysozyme
causes aggregation of citrate-coated AuNPs in a concentration-dependent
manner at nanomolar concentrations of protein. The authors attribute
the behavior to the high pI of lysozyme, making it cationic under
the physiological pH used in the assay. They exploit this phenomenon
to develop a surface plasmon resonance light-scattering assay for
lysozyme in urine.21 Later, when developing
an assay based on the aptamer-mediated mechanism depicted in Figure 1, they needed to
completely reoptimize the ionic strength conditions.22 This pair of published reports exemplifies the careful
consideration of control experiments that must be employed when developing
assays relying on AuNP aggregation mediated by the aptamer/protein
interaction.

We observe that aggregation-mediated color change—ostensibly
an indicator of the concentration of a protein analyte—is extremely
sensitive to other assay parameters such as concentrations of aptamer,
the time delay between mixing and measuring, wavelengths used for
detection, and ionic strength. Other investigators have noted similar
dependence; sensitivity to ionic strength has been exploited as the
basis of a modified version of the aggregation-based assay format.23 Understanding the nature of the protein/AuNP
interaction is the focus of many current lines of research, particularly
in the complex biological environment.24,25

Conclusions
We have demonstrated that thrombin coagulates AuNPs, inducing an
aggregation-mediated color change, in a concentration-dependent manner.
This phenomenon has been observed in other proteins. The ability of
some proteins to coagulate AuNPs confounds the straightforward interpretation
of assays designed around the protective function of ssDNA (aptamers)
on the surface of AuNPs. We argue that rigorous controls to characterize
the color change mediated by the protein analyte alone must be part
of the process of developing sensor-based assays intended to detect
proteins via this aptamer-mediated AuNP aggregation mechanism. Studies
that neglect to perform these control experiments may be mischaracterizing
the sensing mechanism, inappropriately attributing selectivity to
the action of the aptamer. The sensitivity and generality of the aptamer/AuNP
aggregation approach is compelling, but the proper controls must be
done to ensure reproducible and robust assays.

Experimental Section
Materials
All oligonucleotides were obtained from IDT
(Coralville, IA) as a lyophilized solid and reconstituted to 100 μM
in nuclease-free water to make a long-term stock solution. Oligonucleotides
used in the study include the 29-mer thrombin-binding aptamer (5′-AGT
CCG TGG TAG GGC AGG TTG GGG TGA CT-3′); a random 29-mer oligo
control for thrombin experiments16 (5′-TAG
CTA TGG AAT TCC TCG TAG GCA ACA CA-3′); a PDGF-binding aptamer19 (5′-CAC GCG TAC AAG TTG GGT GGA AGC ATA
GGC AAT GAG CTC TCA TTG GGT TAC CTT TAA GGT-3′); and an ApoE-binding
aptamer19 (5′-ACT AGC TAC GGG GTG
GGT GGG CGG TGT CAG TTT GTT TAT TGG TGC TAT ACA TCC TCT ATA-3′).
All proteins were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Thrombin
(lyophilized from human plasma) was reconstituted into Milli-Q water
to a concentration of 100 U/mL. ApoE3, human, was reconstituted in
0.5 mM DTT and 5 mM NaH2PO4 at pH 7.8 to a concentration
of 100 mM. PDGF-BB (human, recombinant) was reconstituted in sterile
4 mM HCl with 0.1% BSA to a concentration of 20 μg/mL. The binding
buffer for the thrombin assays contained 20 mM Tris-HCl, 140 mM NaCl,
and 5 mM KCl (pH 7.5). “SuperSlik” pipette tips and
“LoBind” tubes (VWR) were used in all sample preparation
and assay performance to minimize loss of thrombin to surfaces.

Synthesis of AuNPs
AuNPs (13 nm) were synthesized via
citrate reduction according to the established literature.18 All solutions were filtered with a 0.4 μm
filter before use, and the glassware was cleaned with aqua regia before
use. (Potential hazard: aqua regia solutions are extremely corrosive
and may result in an explosion, skin burns, or eye and respiratory
tract irritation. Safety goggles, gloves, and other personal protective
equipment must be worn and splash hazard protection must be in place
when working with aqua regia. Aqua regia solutions should be neutralized
by slow addition of sodium bicarbonate before disposal.) Five milliliters
of 38.8 mM trisodium citrate was rapidly added to 50 mL of boiling
1 mM HAuCl4 under reflux and under rapid stirring. Upon
citrate addition, the solution quickly turned dark blue, then gradually
red. The solution was removed from heat 15 min after the initial color
change and allowed to continue stirring until it had cooled to RT,
when it was subsequently filtered through a single 0.2 μm nylon
membrane filter. The AuNP concentration was calculated using the absorbance
at 519 nm and an extinction coefficient of 2.0 × 108 M–1 cm–1.

AuNP Aggregation
Assays
For cuvette-based measurements,
200 μL of AuNPs was mixed with 30 μL of 5 μM thrombin-binding
aptamer in 20 mM Tris-HCl, 140 mM NaCl, and 5 mM KCl, pH 7.5; then,
30 μL of thrombin solutions at varying concentrations was added,
and the solutions were incubated for 5 min. Then, 100 μL of
0.3 M NaCl was added, and samples were incubated at RT for 30 min
before being transferred to a 1 cm path length restricted volume quartz
cuvette for measurement of an absorbance spectrum. Plate-based experiments
were performed in clear 96-well plates and read in a SpectraMax M5
multimode plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). To correct
the pH of the solution, 440 μL of the appropriate “oligo
buffer” was mixed with 2935 μL of stock 13 nm AuNP. The
resulting solution (127.9 μL) was then dispensed to each well
to be used in a plate. A multichannel pipette was then used to deliver
17 μL of the protein samples (and corresponding blanks) to the
appropriate wells simultaneously. The plate was immediately placed
in the plate reader and mixed for 30 s. Five minutes after the addition
of the first samples, the multichannel pipette was used to deliver
56 μL of water to each well. The plate was immediately transferred
to the plate reader, where it was mixed for 30 s before the first
spectrum was collected. Subsequent readings were taken at 10, 20,
and 30 min after the first addition of water, with 30 s of mixing
before each spectrum was collected. These studies were designed so
that the concentration of protein exceeded that of AuNPs in all assays,
with [protein]/[AuNP] ranging from a minimum of 5 to a maximum of
14 across the assay conditions. This excess of protein is likely sufficient
for the formation of a protein monolayer on the AuNP surface in all
assays. The proteins are of comparable size. Thrombin was found to
have a diameter of 5 nm by electron microscopy.26 ApoE was found to exist in two major particle groups by
dynamic light scattering, the majority of which averaged 4 nm.27 PDGF-BB was found to be 7.5 nm × 3.5 nm
× 2.5 nm by X-ray crystallography.28
