We report the sensing properties
of an interesting ternary oxide
CuCo2O4 (CCO) which comprises two earth-abundant
transition elements, both capable of supporting multiple valence states.
We have used a synthesis protocol, which renders unique nanoplatelet-type
morphology but with a degree of biphasic character (CuO as a secondary
phase in addition to the defect-spinel Cu1–xCo2O4). This sample constitution can
be controlled through the use of cation off-stoichiometry, and the
same also influence the sensing response significantly. In particular,
a Co 10 at. % excess CCO (CCO–Co(10)) case exhibits a good
response (∼7.9% at 400 ppm) for NH3 gas with a complete
recovery at room temperature (23 °C, ±1 °C) in 57%
RH. The material performance was investigated for other gases such
as H2S, NO2, and CO. A good response is observed
for H2S and NO2 gases but without a recovery;
however, for CO, a poor response is noted. Herein, we discuss the
specific results for ammonia sensing for the CCO–Co(10) case
in detail via the use of different characterizations and outline the
difference between the cases of the single-phase defect-stabilized
material versus nonpercolating biphasic material.

Introduction
Rapid technological
and industrial developments continuously result
in the emission of hazardous gases, toxins, and biomolecules. Therefore,
sensing of such undesirable chemical or biochemical forms has become
a significant research endeavor in recent years.1−3 Certain gases
such as NH3, NOx, and CO are
contributed to the atmosphere regularly in significant quantities
by transportation and chemical industries, which have a deteriorating
influence on the environment in various ways.4 Issues of safety and security also hinge upon detection of trace
elements of chemical agents. Some of these pollutants are extremely
dangerous, and hence sensing them at ppm levels is crucial for the
harmonious survival of mankind as well as the ecosystem at large.

Different materials and detection schemes have been adopted in
this context to achieve high responsivity combined with less response/recovery
time, which are key quality factors that define the sensor performance.
In particular, oxides are extensively researched for gas sensing,
in view of their robust material properties and their ability to change
valence through charge transfer.5−7 Several binary oxides have been
examined for effective gas sensing and have yielded promising results.5−13 The interaction of analyte gas molecules depends on the surface
atoms present in the metal oxides. The catalytic activity of metal
oxides depends on the relative acidic and basic character of the atoms
present on the surface which is affected by coordination between the
metal atom and oxygen anions. In the case of binary metal oxides,
the accessible property regimes in this respect are rather limited.
On the other hand, in the case of ternary metal oxides, there are
two acidic sites and one basic site; hence, the multitude of their
interactions renders wider property windows for the catalytic performance.
However, the ternary oxide and sulfide systems, which offer distinct
advantages of stoichiometry and valence control, are relatively less
explored by far.14−27

Herein, we report the sensing properties of an interesting
ternary
oxide CuCo2O4 (CCO) which comprises two earth
abundant transition elements, each having an ability to support multiple
valence states (Cu 1+ and 2+ and Co 2+ and 3+).28−30 Although the
sensing performance of CCO at a high temperature of 300 °C is
already reported,26 its effective gas-sensing
response at room temperature is hitherto unexplored. In the present
study, we have successfully shown that a controlled stoichiometry
manipulation and porous nanoplatelet morphology of CCO were responsible
for superior gas-sensing activity for ammonia gas at room temperature.

Results
and Discussion
Characterization of the Gas-Sensing Material
A detailed
description of the synthesis and characterization of the three different
materials, viz., CCO, CCO–Cu(10), and CCO–Co(10) is
reported in our previous publication.28 It was envisaged to achieve porous nanoplatelet morphology of the
material that would facilitate effective gas adsorption on account
of the enhanced surface area for higher surface accessibility, the
proper range of conductivity, and higher density of surface defects.
Although there are numerous methods to obtain a single-phase CCO starting
with a stoichiometric mixture of precursors; however, these do not
yield the appealing morphology of interest required for different
applications such as battery electrodes and sensor elements.26,28−34 In the current study, it was observed that the hydrothermal synthesis
route using a stoichiometric mixture of precursors resulted in a product
with the desired morphology but with an undesirable secondary phase.
As seen in Figure S2a, the powder product
consists of a copper-deficient defect-spinel phase of CCO along with
a minor secondary phase of CuO. Hence, to suppress this secondary
phase, the synthesis was performed with an off-stoichiometric precursor
mixture with excess cobalt. It was found that 10 at. % excess cobalt
in the precursor mixture leads to a single-phase sample with almost
a negligible secondary CuO phase. It means that the nearly single-phase
sample formed has excess cobalt, so by implication, it is also a defect
spinel but a single phase. Separately, we also examined the case of
excess copper added to the precursor to enhance the CuO component
so as to obtain a CuO/defect–CCO composite in the context of
another application interest. This gave us an opportunity to examine
all these three materials, which represent interesting sample states
in terms of the phase constitution, defects states, and biphasic versus
single phase nature for the sensing application. In the following
section, we give some relevant characterization results performed
on the new set of samples used specifically in this work.

Figure 1a–c shows
the field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images of
the three cases of interest, namely CCO, CCO–Cu(10), and CCO–Co(10).
The morphology generally appears to be in the form of flower-like
nanoplatelets which cross one another. Thus, the off-stoichiometry
does not make major changes in the morphology. The high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) data of Figure 1d,e reveal that the platelets
are assembled through nanoparticles of a rather uniform size of about
10–15 nm via oriented attachment as suggested by their planar
assembly with nanoporosity throughout. Figure 1f shows lattice fringes with a d-spacing of 0.28 nm, which matches well with the (220) plane of CCO.
Thus, the nanoporous nature of these nanoplatelets is essential for
the sensing application because it provides better access and high
surface area for the adsorption of the analyte gas.

Sensor Response
First, the gas-sensing behavior of
the CCO–Co(10) material for different gases at room temperature
was investigated, and the resultant data are shown in Figure 2a. The exposure time for the
analytic gas was kept fixed at 3 min. The CCO–Co(10) powder
coating used for gas sensing was drop casted on a glass substrate,
and corresponding X-ray diffraction (XRD) is shown in Figure S2b. Basically, it represents the same
XRD as that of the CCO–Co(10) powder material. It was found
that the material senses all the gases, but it shows recovery only
for the case of NH3. In the presence of reducing gases
such as NH3, H2S, and CO, the resistance was
increased, whereas in the presence of oxidizing gas (such as NO2), there was a reduction in the resistance of CCO–Co(10).
This confirms the p-type nature of CCO Co(10).34−36 As reported
above, CCO with their nanotube morphology was implemented for gas
sensing at a high temperature of 300 °C for a few target gases.26 Although, it is clear that the other gases interact
nonreversibly (at least over the time scale examined) with the sample
(Figure 2); however,
the novelty of our work lies in the fact that gas sensing is being
carried out at room temperature. Because both the elements in this
ternary system, viz., Co and Cu, exist in two valence states, it is
not entirely surprising that the material will respond to reducing
as well as oxidizing gases. The recovery being an important consideration
in a sensing application, further work was mainly focused on NH3 sensing. The statements made here about the sensing of different
gases are broadly valid for CCO and other off-stoichiometric cases
also.

Figure 2 (a) Gas-sensing response of CCO–Co(10) toward 400 ppm of
different gases NO2, CO, H2S, and NH3 at 23 °C in dry air. (b) Ammonia-sensing measurements for different
stoichiometries of CCO at 23 °C in dry air.

Figure 2b
shows
NH3 gas-sensing properties of all three composites in dry
air as carrier gas at 23 °C. It can be seen from Figure 2a that at room temperature,
the CCO–Co(10) sample (single-phase defect spinel) showed a
much superior response toward NH3 gas as compared to the
CCO and CCO–Cu(10) biphasic samples. The CCO–Co(10)
exhibits gas response of ∼6% at 400 ppm of NH3.
There could be three key reasons for this observation of superior
performance by a single-phase material as compared to the other two
cases, which are in a composite state. First is the potential competition
for gas adsorption sites between the two phases depending on the adsorption
chemistry; second is the potential siphoning of active carriers to
the interface traps between the two constituent phases making them
ineffective for transport. Last is the transfer of the carrier to
the secondary phase rendering them unavailable for transport because
of percolation issues. Further work will be needed to elucidate and
separate out these issues.

Therefore, on the basis of the high
sensitivity of CCO–Co(10)
to NH3 at room temperature (23 °C), further detailed
gas-sensing studies were performed on this CCO–Co(10) material.
For practical application, it is necessary to determine gas-sensing
properties of the sensor at room temperature, and for this condition,
the sensor performance is greatly influenced by the surrounding humidity
as well. Hence, measurements were performed in a practically typical
relative humidity condition (∼57% RH). Figure 3a shows NH3-sensing behavior of
CCO–Co(10) in the presence of 57% RH and dry air at 23 °C.
It can be seen that the sensor exhibits enhanced response in the presence
of 57% RH as compared to dry air. Importantly, the recovery time is
also reduced in the humid atmosphere (14 min compared to 18 min in
dry air). The enhanced response in the humid environment suggests
that in the presence of humidity, NH3 reacts with H2O forming NH4+ and OH–, which
facilitates the interaction with the sensor.37 Therefore, concentration-dependent NH3 response, cyclic
reproducibility, and also the device stability over the period were
carried out in 57% RH at room temperature.

CCO–Co(10) in dry air and 57% RH

concentrations of NH3; and (c) its relation between % S with NH3 concentration in 57% RH at 23 °C.
(d) Dynamic response of CCO–Co(10) toward ammonia for different
cycles of 400 ppm in 57% RH at 23 °C. (e) Stability of CCO–Co(10)
toward 400 ppm NH3 in 57% RH at 23 °C.

Figure 3b shows
the response of CCO–Co(10) over the concentration range from
25 to 400 ppm of NH3 in 57% RH at room temperature. Also,
the response as a function of NH3 gas concentration was
noted to be linear up to about 100 ppm suggesting nonsaturation of
the active sites over this full range (Figure 3c). At higher concentrations, however, saturation
is noted from the departure from linearity.

Figure 3d shows
the performance repeatability of CCO–Co(10) exposed to 400
ppm NH3 in 57% RH over seven cycles. A small decrease in
the response is noted after one cycle, which can be attributed to
the leftover analyte gas on the surface of the material from the previous
cycle. However, after the first cycle, the device exhibits quite a
stable gas response. We have also investigated the stability of CCO–Co(10)
over a period of 15 days (Figure 3e) and observed that there is a slight gradual drop
in the response over the first couple of days, but the response remains
relatively constant over the period of 15 days. This suggests a robust
gas-sensing performance of the CCO–Co(10) sensor at room temperature
in a humid atmosphere (57% RH).

Table S1 compares the response of CCO–Co(10)
to NH3 with other metal oxide semiconductors. It is evident
that CCO–Co(10) renders fairly good gas response values with
fast response and lower optimal operating temperature comparable or
better than other sensing materials.

In general, the sensing
properties of metal oxide-based gas sensors
depend on many factors such as surface area, microstructures, defect
levels, and so forth. The detailed gas-sensing mechanism is incorporated
in the Supporting Information. Figure S4 shows schematic illustration of the
gas-sensing mechanism in the presence of reducing and oxidizing gases.

To systematically understand the observed gas-sensing data at room
temperature, it is essential to discuss the microstates of the three
samples examined, namely CCO, CCO–Co(10), and CCO–Cu(10).
As discussed in our previous paper at some length, under the specific
hydrothermal growth conditions used to achieve the peculiar platelet-like
morphology for the benefit of higher surface area and accessibility,
the use of the stoichiometric mixture of precursors leads to a mixed
phase; wherein, a small quantity of CuO is present as a secondary
phase in addition to the main CCO phase, which is naturally Cu-deficient.28 Other reports have also discussed the occurrence
of the secondary CuO phase.31−34,38,39 When an excess cobalt precursor is included in the synthesis vessel,
the contribution of the secondary CuO phase diminishes, and at about
10% excess Co, an almost single-phase sample is realized. It must
be borne in mind, however, that this single phase is also a defect-spinel
phase because it is richer in cobalt than the basic CCO stoichiometry.
It is possible that in this case the charge balance will be enforced
via a change in the oxygen stoichiometry. Separately, when excess
Cu is added in the precursor mixture, it can play a dual role. It
could simply add to the separated CuO secondary component or partially
eliminate the Cu vacancies. This could again lead to a defect-stabilized
CCO phase with a different density of defect types as compared to
the other two cases. Thus, it is hard to precisely compare the three
cases, although some compelling arguments can be made, particularly
in the context of the observed much stronger response of CCO–Co(10)
to ammonia as compared to the other two biphasic cases.

The
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area measurements
were performed on the three samples to examine whether the initial
precursor stoichiometry differences affect the surface area significantly,
which in turn influences the sensor performance (Figure S3). It can be seen that the surface area of CCO, CCO–Cu(10),
and CCO–Co(10) was 45, 50, and 55 m2/g, respectively;
and hence, they do not differ that significantly. However, there will
be a little contribution of increased surface area on gas response
in CCO–Co(10). To further establish the chemiresistive sensing
results, the powders were pelletized to study their bulk electrical
conductivity. It was observed that the conductivity was lowest for
the CCO–Co(10) case, followed by the CCO–Cu(10) case,
and then the CCO case. Because the three-dimensional percolation threshold
for the secondary phase to make a major influence on the transport
is 18%, in both the cases of CCO and CCO–Co(10), the secondary
CuO phase is nonpercolating. Thus, the transport is primarily dominated
by the defect-spinel CCO component, and the differences in the defect-borne
electronic states in the three cases are responsible for the observed
resistivity data. The conductivity (resistivity) is lowest (highest)
for the CCO–Co(10) case as compared to those of the other two
cases involving the presence of the secondary CuO phase in the form
of nonpercolating distributed nanoscale regions. It suggests that
this secondary phase may have a role in reducing the interface trap
density and hence scattering. The changes in conductivity (resistivity)
of the three samples are, however, not as significant as the ammonia
sensitivity difference reflected by the CCO–Co(10) case sample
vis-a-vis the other two cases. Thus, the search for the origin of
this effect has to be sought in another argument.

In the two
cases of CCO and CCO–Cu(10), wherein the secondary
CuO phase is present, it would presumably occupy some grain boundary
space and will also produce heterointerfaces. When the sensing gas
(NH3) is introduced, it will be adsorbed on the surfaces
of both the major CCO defect-spinel phase and the secondary CuO phase.
The electron donated by the sensing gas will influence the conductivity
of the material, which will be decided by the possibility of the transfer
of this electron to the major phase because the secondary phase cannot
by itself percolate. Our observation of much lower response to ammonia
for the biphasic cases implies that there is a hindrance to the carrier
transfer process between the major and secondary phases. This hindrance
could occur by the band alignment and/or presence of interface trap
states. The observed low response in the biphasic composites as compared
to the CCO–Co(10) case could also be explained based on the
hard soft acid base (HSAB) theory. In these composites, copper is
in the form of Cu2+, which is a borderline acid; however,
cobalt is in the form of Co3+, which is a hard acid. The
reducing gas NH3 is a hard base. According to HSAB theory,
hard acid prefers hard base; therefore, in the present case, the Co3+ site is comparatively active toward the NH3 gas
compared to Cu2+. As discussed earlier, in the CCO case,
CuO emerges as the impurity phase, and the resulting surface contribution
of this weak sensing phase will be counterproductive for sensor performance.
In the CCO–Cu(10) case, this problem may get accentuated further.

In the case of the nanosystem at hand, the unavailability of information
regarding the precise defect and interface states precludes a full
understanding of the observed effects at this time. However, a message
emerges that use of nanocomposites, formed intentionally or unintentionally,
especially in the nonpercolating regime for the secondary phase, involves
complex considerations and cannot always ensure an enhanced response.

Conclusions
A ternary oxide, namely CCO, with two multivalent
transition elements,
is examined for its chemiresistive properties. Unique nanoplatelet-type
morphology is realized by the specific choice of the synthetic protocol,
but it intrinsically leads to a biphasic state (CuO as a secondary
phase in addition to the defect-spinel Cu1–xCo2O4). Employing a degree of cation
off-stoichiometry, the constitution of the sample is controlled, and
the sensing response is found to be modified accordingly. Three cases,
viz., 10 at. % excess Co with CCO, 10 at. % excess Cu with CCO, and
the right stoichiometric precursor ratios are examined. In particular,
a Co 10 at. % excess CCO (CCO–Co(10)) case exhibits a good
response (∼7.9% at 400 ppm) for NH3 gas with a complete
recovery in 57% RH at 23 °C. Although the material exhibited
a good response (without any recovery) for H2S and NO2 gases, the sensing performance was found to be poor in the
case of CO. These observations are attributed primarily to the differences
in the character of the carrier transport between the cases of the
single-phase defect-stabilized material versus the nonpercolating
biphasic material.

Experimental Section
Material Synthesis
The CCO sample was synthesized by
a simple hydrothermal route. All the chemicals used in the present
study were of analytical grade. The Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (>99%) powder was obtained from Merck, whereas
Co(NO3)2·6H2O (>99%) and
urea
were obtained from LabChem. Initially, copper and cobalt precursors
were mixed in deionized (DI) water in 1:2 molar ratio followed by
the addition of 0.1 M urea to the solution. This was allowed to stir
for 30 min under ambient conditions. The solution thus obtained was
transferred into a 160 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and was heated at
120 °C for 16 h. The resultant black-colored solution was washed
with DI water and then dried at 80 °C for 6 h. The final product
was annealed at 350 °C for 2 h to obtain the desired phase and
constitution of CCO. The same procedure was followed for preparing
CCO samples with different cation stoichiometry ratios of copper and
cobalt in the precursor mixture, namely copper excess case of CCO–Cu
(10 at. % excess) and cobalt excess case of CCO–Co (10 at.
%. excess).

Characterization
The required phase
formation of the
material was elucidated from powder XRD measurements that were carried
out on a Philips X’Pert PRO diffractometer with nickel-filtered
Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). The diffractograms
were recorded at a scanning rate of 1° min–1 between 10° and 80°. The morphology of the material was
established using a high-resolution field emission Nova NanoSEM system.
HRTEM (FEI Tecnai G2, F30 TEM microscope operating at an accelerating
voltage of 300 kV) was also used for atomistic microstructural elucidation.
The gas adsorption experiment (up to 1 bar) was performed on Quantachrome
Autosorb-automated gas sorption analyzer.

Gas-Sensing Device Fabrication
and Measurements
The
gas-sensing setup is depicted in Figure S1a,b. An interdigitated (ID) pattern was developed on indium tin oxide
(ITO)-coated glass with a CO2 laser scriber. A fine paste
was made by grinding the as-synthesized CCO powder along with a polyvinylidene
fluoride binder and 2-propanol as a solvent. This paste was deposited
on the ID-patterned ITO glass by doctor blading and maintained at
150 °C for 2 h. The film was mounted on the alumina plate and
placed inside a chamber. Constant dc voltage of 2 V was applied across
the film and current was measured by a Keithley 2400 source meter.
We used cylinders of test gases with 0.1% of test gas balanced in
nitrogen. The desired concentration of the test gas was obtained by
controlling mass flow rates of the specific test gas and dry air.
The gas-sensing measurements were carried out at 250 sccm of dry air.
The gas response was measured at 23 °C in dry air. Because at
room temperature the humidity can also affect the gas-sensing performance,
the gas-sensing measurements were also carried out in 57% RH at 23
°C. The gas response (S) of the p-type sensor
is defined as the ratio of the resistance in the presence of gas (Rg) to the resistance in the presence of air
(Ra).  where, Ra and Rg are the resistance of the sensor in air and
gas, respectively. Relative percentage response is defined as % S = |Rg – Ra|/Ra × 100. Other important
parameters such as response time and recovery time were also determined
from the gas-sensing experiments. It is useful to mention here that
it was difficult to achieve a perfect steady state in our case, and
hence to control the experimental time, we had to accept a small drift
in current before letting the sensing gas in for the measurement.
Therefore, the response data are not included for extremely tiny concentrations
of gas (e.g., 10 ppm), for which there is a chance of a small degree
of ambiguity regarding the precise value of response.
