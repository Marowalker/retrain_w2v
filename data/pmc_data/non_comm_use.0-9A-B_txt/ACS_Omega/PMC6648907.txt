The
modulation of threshold voltage (VTH)
of organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs) was investigated by embedding
a thin CuO layer between the two semiconductor layers. The results
showed that the VTH of OTFTs with a CuO
layer can be effectively tuned by controlling the positive gate-to-source
voltage (VGS0) under stress of gate-to-source
voltages. The VTH shifts from −3.67
to −0.82 V when the positive VGS0 varies from 30 to 50 V. This can be explained by the mechanism of
trapping electrons at the interface between the CuO charge-separation
layer and the active layer. To confirm the role of the CuO layer acting
as the charge-separation source, two organic thin-film diodes, indium-tin
oxide(ITO)/tris (8-quinolinolato) aluminum(III) (Alq3)/pentacene/Al
(inverted-stack diode) and ITO/Alq3/CuO/pentacene/Al (inverted-stack
diode with a CuO layer), were fabricated and their diode current characteristics
were measured. For the second device, a large current flow was observed
at positive bias on the ITO electrodes, which is ascribed to the internal
bipolar charge separation within the added CuO zone.

1 Introduction
Organic thin-film transistors
(OTFTs) have been widely studied
over the recent decades due to their low cost, easy processability,
flexibility, and applicability in large-area devices.1,2 Although sufficient mobility in OTFTs has been achieved for various
applications,3−5 many factors still restrict the practical applications
of OTFTs, such as how to control the threshold voltage (VTH) and surface modifying technology. Generally, VTH control techniques are highly important in
designing OTFTs with optimal properties and low VTH values. Surface modifying technology6,7 and
new gate dielectric materials8,9 were used for achieving
the enhancement of the electrical properties of OTFTs. Recently, high
work function (WF) noble metals were applied as gate electrodes to
change the VTH of OTFTs.10−12 In addition, high WF transition metal oxide (TMO) layers, such as
WO3 or MoO3, were also employed as conversing
Al gate electrodes to control the VTH for
acquiring the low VTH of OTFTs.13,14 Copper oxide (CuO) was used for creating efficient hole injection
in OTFTs15,16 or organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs).17 Previous studies mainly focused on the gate
electrode or the interface between the semiconductor and the electrodes.
All these efforts were aimed at altering the charge distribution in
the transistor for achieving low VTH values.

Here, we present an efficient way to control the trap densities
in OTFT channel layers by inserting a thin CuO layer between the two
semiconductor layers. It is well known that VTH depends on many different factors, such as trap densities
in the channel layer. In this paper, a regular positive shift of threshold
voltage in OTFTs can be realized by controlling the positive gate-source
voltage (VGS0) under stress of gate-to-source
voltages. The positive shift of the VTH is very useful in reducing the magnitude of VTH and changing the operation mode of p-channel OTFTs. An electric
filed assisted bipolar charge separation mechanism within CuO
is proposed for demonstrating the previous phenomenon in this
paper. To better understand the functionality of the CuO charge separation
layer in the OTFT and analyze the appearance of charge production
and separation within the CuO zone, we fabricated two simple inverted-stack
diodes using conventional materials and tested their current–voltage
characteristics. The comparison of current–voltage characteristics
of the two devices clearly demonstrates the bipolar charge separation
within the CuO zone.

2 Experimental Section
Figure 1a shows
the schematic structure of the proposed 3 nm-thick CuO-embedded OTFT
(CuO-embedded OTFT). Here, the heavily doped n-type silicon wafer
with a 300 nm-thick layer and the thermally oxided SiO2 (Ci = 10 nF) is used
as the gate electrode and the insulator layer, respectively. The pentacene
and CuO were vacuum thermally deposited on the insulator layer in
turn under a pressure of 3 × 10–4 Pa. The CuO
layer with a thickness of 3 nm was inserted in the middle of the pentacene
layer, which possessed a total thickness of 50 nm. Then, the Cu source
and drain electrodes (40 nm-thick) were thermally evaporated. The
length (L) and width (W) of the
channel were 100 and 10 000 μm, respectively. The electrical
properties were characterized by a semiconductor parameter analyzer
(Agilent 4155C) at room temperature. To confirm the charge-separation
function of CuO, inverted-stack devices A and B were fabricated for
comparison. Here, tris(8-quinolinolato) aluminum(III) (Alq3) and pentacene are used as the electron-transport layer (ETL) and
hole-transport layer (HTL), respectively. As shown in Figure 1b, the structure of device
A is ITO/Alq3 (100 nm)/pentacene (120 nm)/Al, whereas the
structure of device B is ITO/Alq3 (100 nm)/CuO (3 nm)/pentacene
(120 nm)/Al. All of the layers in the two devices were deposited through
the common thermal evaporation under a vacuum pressure of 3.0 ×
10–5 Pa. The pentacene and CuO layers were thermally
deposited on the glass substrate at rate of 0.5 and 0.3 Å s–1, respectively. The 50 nm-thick CuO film was thermally
deposited on the glass substrate in a vacuum chamber under a pressure
of 3 × 10–4 Pa and regarded as sample C (glass
substrate/CuO (50 nm)). The 50 nm-thick pentacene film was thermally
deposited on the glass substrate, and the 1 nm-thick CuO film was
thermally deposited on the 50 nm-thick pentacene film and sample D
(glass substrate/pentacene (50 nm)/CuO (1 nm)) was obtained. The current
properties of devices A and B were characterized by a semiconductor
parameter analyzer (keithley4200) at room temperature. X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) characterization of samples C and D was done by
multiphotoelectron spectroscopy (Kratos AXis Ultra(DLD)).

3 Results and Discussion
The output and transfer characteristics of the CuO-embedded OTFT
are shown in Figure 2a,b, respectively. When a negative gate voltage is applied, the current
(−ID) increases. The CuO-embedded
OTFT exhibits good p-type channel field-effect properties with its
mobility, VTH, and current on/off ratio
being 0.18 cm2 V–1 s–1, −8.0 V, and 1.4 × 104, respectively.

Figure 2 Output characteristics
(a) and transfer characteristics (b) of
the CuO-embedded OTFT.

However, the mobility and VTH of the
pentacene-based OFET are 0.06 cm2 V–1 s–1 and −17.5 V, respectively (as shown
in Figure 3). Compared
to those of the pentacene-based OFET, the hole mobility of the CuO-embeded
OFET is dramatically increased, whereas its VTH is greatly decreased. Meanwhile, author’s previous
work18 demonstrated that the improvement
of the field-effect mobility of the CuO-embedded TFT was attributed
to the charge transfer (CT) complexes based on electron transfer from
pentacene to CuO. CuO acts as a p-type dopant18 which could accept electrons from organic materials and generate
holes as demonstrated with ReO3, CuI, and MoO3.19 When a CuO film was thermally deposited
on the surface of the pentacene film in a vacuum chamber, CuO penetrated
into the surface of the pentacene film and led to the formation of
CT complexes based on an electron transfer from the highest occupied
molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level (5.0 eV)19 of pentacene to the conduction band energy level (4.7 eV)20,21 of CuO due to p-type doping22 (as shown
in Figure 4a). X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to reveal the electron transfer
at the interface between organic materials and metal oxide materials.23 We tested the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
of sample C (glass/CuO (50 nm)) and sample D (glass/pentacene (50
nm))/CuO (1 nm). As shown in Figure 4b, the Cu 2p3/2 peak shifts to higher energies
in the XPS spectra of sample D than that in the XPS spectra of sample
C. Since a negatively charged atom has a higher binding energy of
electrons,23 the spectral shift23 means an electron transfer from the pentacene
layer to the CuO layer and the formation of CT complexes at the interface
between the pentacene layer and CuO layer. The charge transfer (CT)
complexes based on p-type doping can shift the Fermi level of pentacene
toward the valence band edge of pentacene,23,24 which could reduce organic material bulk hole trap density22,24 and enhance the pentacene bulk hole carrier injection.24 Therefore, the thin CuO layer, directly been
embedded between the pentacene layer, serves as the hole-injection
layer, which is responsible for the improvement of the field-effect
mobility of the CuO-embedded TFT.18

(50 nm)) and D (glass substrate/pentacene (50 nm)/CuO (1 nm)).

For CuO-embedded OTFTs, the gate-to-source
voltage (denoted as VGS0 = −50,
−30, 30, and 50 V)
was constantly applied for 50 s, and the electrical characteristics
of the OTFTs were measured (as shown in Figures 5a and 4b) under various VGS0 values. As shown in Figure 5 and Table I, when the applied VGS0 is changed in the positive range, a positive shift of VTH of the CuO-embedded OTFT is observed. For example,
when VGS0 varies from 30 to 50 V, the VTH shifts from −3.67 to −0.82
V (as shown in Table I), the current Ion (the source–drain ID at VGS = −50
V and VDS = −40 V) increases, and
the mobility hardly changes during the shift of VTH. The transfer characteristic curves hardly shift under
negative VGS0 stress (as shown in Figure 5a,b). This shift
of the threshold voltage cannot be observed in pure pentacene-based
OTFTs (as shown in Figure 6). Thus, it can be concluded that the CuO-embedded layer is
very important in modulating the VTH of
OTFTs.

OTFT under different VGS0 stress: −50,

50	–0.82	0.179	1.95 × 10–4	10–4	
As shown in Figure 5b and Table I, after
the positive VGS0 (30 or 50 V) are constantly
stressed in the CuO-embedded OTFT, the current (−ID) is enhanced, and the phenomenon was similar to the
result demonstrated with time domain measurement that is used to determine
the type of charge trapping in OTFTs.25,26 However, the
situation with the pentacene-based OTFT is different (see Figure 6). The results from Figure 5 and Table I indicate that the CuO-embedded
layer in the OTFT possesses the capability of trapping electrons by
applying a positive VGS0, and the trapped
electrons could induce extra hole accumulation in the OTFT channel,
resulting in a positive shift of VTH of
the CuO-embedded OTFT (as shown in Figure 5b). The trapped electron population in CuO
can be changed by adjusting the positive VGS0.

As shown in Table I, the field-effect mobilities of the CuO-embedded OTFT remain
unchanged
with initial gate voltages (VGS0). In
this case, the trapped electrons in the CuO-embedded layer cannot
be attributed to the formation of charge transfer (CT) complexes based
on electron transfer near the point of contact of CuO and pentacene.
The process of electron transfer near the point of contact of CuO
and pentacene was complete and can be hardly changed with initial
gate voltages (VGS0).Therefore, it is
necessary to illustrate the mechanism of the trapped electrons in
the CuO-embedded OTFT with initial gate voltages (VGS0).

To illustrate the phenomena in this device,
a possible electric-field-assisted
tunneling mechanism is shown in Figure 7. The capability of CuO p-dopants in electron accepting
could result in electron transfer from pentacene to CuO and form charge
transfer (CT) complexes between CuO and pentacene due to p-type doping.
The mutual energy level alignment from both sides of the interface
based on CuO/pentacene generates the organic–inorganic heterojunction
as demonstrated with the interface of MoO3 and the hole
organic transporting material (as shown in Figure 7).27,28 With a positive VGS0 stress being applied to the CuO-embedded
OTFT, the pentacene and CuO materials exhibit large bulk resistivity
in this case. Therefore, the CuO layer could act as the charge-separation
source and generate holes and electrons similar to the MoO327,28 charge-generation layer. A high external electric
field toward the Cu electrodes is dropped in the CuO-embedded layer
under positive VGS0. As shown in Figure 7, holes and electrons
are dissociated upon electric-field-assisted Fowler–Nordheim
tunneling28,29 in the CuO charge-separation layer (CSL),
and the separated holes can be injected into the neighboring pentacene
HTL and finally flow out to the external electrodes. Electrons are
trapped at the interface between the pentacene and CuO layers due
to the poor electron-transporting capability of pentacene in the CuO-embedded
OTFT and the presence of the injected barrier, and thus the trapped
electrons induce free holes in pentacene and finally lead to an increase
in the source–drain current (ID) (as shown in Figure 5b and Table I). The
larger the positive VGS0 value is used,
the more the hole–electron pairs are generated and separated
in the CuO zone, leading to an increased population of trapped electrons.
Therefore, the trapped electron population in CuO can be controlled
by adjusting the positive VGS0. When the
CuO-embedded OTFT was applied with negative VGS0 stress, the pentacene and the thin CuO layer are both hole-transport
materials in this case and the embedded CuO layer does not affect
the charge injection and transport in the device. Thus, no efficient
hole–electron pairs generate and separate in the CuO zone.

level of the heterojunction based on the CuO charge-separation
layer (CSL)/pentacene in the proposed electric-field-assisted tunneling
model, where Φt is the trap level with respect to
the CuO valence band maximum and ΦB is the tunneling
barrier. Holes and electrons are dissociated upon application of a
reverse external electric field (under application of a positive VGS0); holes can be injected into the neighboring
pentacene and electrons are trapped at the interface between pentacene
and CuO. “●” and “○” symbols
represent electrons and holes, respectively.

The shift of VTH is related to
the
difference of trapped charges of OTFTs.30 If the trapped electrons can be controlled, the VTH of OTFTs can also be strictly tuned. So, the VTH of CuO-embedded OTFT depends on the trapped
electron population in CuO, which is also changeable with the positive VGS0.

Figure 8 shows the
voltage–current density characteristics of the two diodes.
In device A, in view of the stacking order of pentacene and Alq3, essentially very low current flow is observed in forward
bias (ITO positive) (as shown in Figure 8), which is derived from the poor electron-transporting
capability of pentacene and the low hole mobility of Alq3.31 On the other hand, essentially low
current flow is observed in reverse bias (ITO negative) in device
B (as shown in Figure 8), which is attributed to the presence of a large injected barrier
in the pentacene HTL/Al electrode and Alq3 ETL/ITO electrode.
For device B, large current flow is observed in forward bias (as shown
in Figure 8). We can
notice that the behavior of the current–voltage characteristic
of device B is quite similar to that of the conventional double-layer
diodes. The only difference between devices A and B is the additional
CuO layer inserted in device B. The insertion of extra layers between
existing organic layers usually brings about a large decrease of current
due to the increase of injection barriers and bulk resistivity. Therefore,
the origin of the considerable current enhancement was not ascribed
to the increase of the injected current. In device A, when an ITO
is biased positively, the inserted layer of CuO acts as the internal
bipolar charge-generation source. The holes and electrons are dissociated
under the electric field toward the Al electrodes supplied from positive
bias (as shown in Figure 7). The dissociated holes can be injected into the adjacent
pentacene HTL and electrons can be injected into the adjacent Alq3 ETL. The holes and electrons are transported through organic
layers and finally flew out to the external electrodes, resulting
in a large current as shown in Figure 8. When an ITO is negative biased, there is no efficient
charge generation from the CuO additional layers because of the presence
of low mobility and an injected barrier. Thus, it is clear that the
origin of large current flow in device B is ascribed to the behavior
of charge separation of the extra inserted CuO layer. Thus, the result
clearly revealed the bipolar charge separation proposed within the
CuO zone.

4 Conclusions
Regular control of the threshold voltages of CuO-embedded OTFTs
is successfully achieved by applying different positive gate-to-source
voltage (VGS0) stress. The population
of trapped electrons between the CuO layer and the active layer can
be changed with positive VGS0. The mobility
hardly changes during the shift of VTH. To illustrate this phenomenon, an electric-field assisted tunneling
mechanism within the CuO charge separation zone is proposed. On the
basis of the comparison of current–voltage characteristics
of two simple inverted-stack diodes, it clearly revealed the presence
of bipolar charge separation within the CuO zone. This research could
be helpful in fabricating OTFTs with controllable VTH and offer useful guidelines for the development of
other types of organic thin-film devices, such as light-emitting diodes,
memory devices, etc.
