Here, we report the development of
inorganic–organic hybrid
nanocomposites through selective modification of the negative outer
surfaces of halloysite nanoclays with two different organosilanes
having primary or secondary amine sites to be explored them as novel
and cost-effective adsorbents for the extraction of toxic inorganic
contaminants from aqueous solution. They possess excellent selectivity
for the adsorption of mercury, which shows monolayer molecular adsorption
over the nanocomposites. The adsorption kinetics of Hg(II) is very
fast and follows pseudo-second-order model compared to pseudo-first-order
model. A combined experimental and theoretical study demonstrated
that Hg(II) uptake by these nanocomposites is highly favorable and
spontaneous up to 40 °C, and beyond this temperature, the uptake
capacity gradually reduced. Temperature-dependent adsorption study
exhibits endothermicity at low temperature (≤40 °C) and
exothermicity beyond 40 °C. pH-dependent adsorption study showed
their high uptake capacity until pH 7, which reduced at alkaline pH.
All of the nanocomposites hold excellent adsorption capacity even
at low concentration of adsorbate, along with multicycle sorption
capability. The outstanding adsorption capacity as well as the easy
synthetic route to achieve these nanocomposites may attract researchers
to develop low-cost adsorbents to capture toxic metals, which in turn
regulate the permissible limit of these toxic metals in drinking water.

1 Introduction
Contamination
of toxic heavy-metal ions discharged from textile,
fertilizer, mining, refining, and printing industries into water has
been identified as a serious threat to not only public health but
also the environment and natural ecosystems, as the toxic heavy metals
present in liquid effluents are persistent, nonbiodegradable, and
bioaccumulative.1−3 Among the several toxic heavy metals, mercury is
the most harmful pollutant with a permissible limit of 2.0 ppb in
drinking water. Mercury exposure via direct contact or gradual bioaccumulation
leads to severe damage to human nerves, lungs, kidneys, and other
organs. Currently, mercury has been excessively released into the
environment through rapid discharge of industrial waste, including
fossil fuel combustion, batteries, electronic materials, and chemicals.
To date, several techniques have been adopted for heavy-metals removal,
e.g., adsorption, precipitation, ion exchange, reverse osmosis, and
nanofiltration.4−8

Among the various techniques, adsorption is fascinating to
researchers
owing to its simplicity, low cost, and a reliable chemical engineering
process, which has potential to overcome the aforementioned environmental
issues.9 For efficient mercury removal
from water, several potential adsorbents have been reported in the
literature, such as activated carbon,10,11 graphene,12 chelate-incorporated fibers,13,14 chitosan,15,16 cellulose,17,18 and porous silica.19,20 Although activated carbon is
highly porous with large specific surface area and high adsorption
efficiency, it is expensive to use and regenerate, thus limiting its
large-scale synthesis for industrial application.19 Besides activated carbon, graphene-based adsorbents with
large effective surface areas possess excellent adsorption capacity
and selectivity, but the synthesis of such materials involves time-consuming
steps to produce well-dispersed nanocarbon flakes and their functional
derivatives.17 The potential toxicity of
nanoscale adsorbents and difficulties in repossessing the adsorbents
after metal-ions adsorption are the major limitations of some techniques.21 Again, adsorbents synthesized based on chelate-modified
wool or polyester fibers involve either high-temperature processes
or special instruments during their synthesis.13,14 An inherent drawback of the synthesis of template-based mesoporous
silica materials is that it is not a cost-effective route owing to
the use of expensive sacrificial templates like surfactants, block
copolymers, etc., which in turn restricts their wide use as advanced
adsorbents.22 The pressing need is therefore
to develop environmentally friendly and reusable adsorbents in a large
scale based on low-cost materials and simple synthetic route for efficient
removal of toxic heavy-metal ions.

Recently, inorganic–organic
hybrid nanocomposites (NCs)
consisting of clay materials have provided a new direction in the
frontier area of materials science because of their high abundance
in nature, together with high mechanical and thermal stabilities as
well as diverse applications in the field of environmental remediation,
which includes adsorption of toxic inorganic contaminants, since they
possess good chemical affinity and excellent adsorption efficiency
even at low concentration. Halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) are naturally
occurring and economically sustainable two-layered aluminosilicate
clay (Al2Si2O5(OH)4·nH2O), containing tetrahedral SiO2 sheets and octahedral AlO6 sheets. HNTs having a hollow
tubular structure demonstrate positive inner and negative outer surface
charges, which regulate their physicochemical properties through control
of the chemistry of these constituent elements. However, the disadvantages
of such materials are less metal-loading capabilities and quite low
metal-ion-binding constants, which can be resolved through functionalization
of these materials using active organic functional groups immobilized
over their surfaces. Thus, functionalization of HNTs by organosilanes
gives rise to low-cost adsorbents for the adsorption of toxic heavy-metal
ions, which in turn open a new route for the treatment of industrial
heavy-metal-contaminated wastewater.

We have developed hybrid
NCs consisting of different amine-functionalized
HNTs and explored them as cost-effective sorbents for the removal
of toxic heavy-metal ions from aqueous solution. Chemical analysis
of the NCs was carried out by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and
NMR spectroscopies, whereas morphological characterization was performed
by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Adsorption kinetics and isotherms
for Hg(II) ions were studied using two different adsorbents. The adsorption
capacities of all of the NCs were examined even at low concentration
of adsorbate. A combined experimental and theoretical study was carried
out to demonstrate the kinetics and thermodynamics of mercury adsorption
process. pH-dependent sorption study was also performed to determine
the effect of pH on the uptake efficacy. Subsequently, stabilities
of these NCs were illustrated by their repetitive use and their efficacies
were compared to those of the reported amine-based adsorbents.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of P-HNTs
and S-HNTs
The nanocomposites were synthesized based on the
selective modification
of the outer surfaces of HNTs using aminosilanes, having primary or
secondary amine sites through the grafting of 3-(aminopropyl)triethoxysilane
(P-HNTs) or trimethoxy[3-(methylamino)propyl]silane (S-HNTs), respectively,
as ascribed in Scheme 1. The chemical modification of HNTs surfaces due to the grafting
of aminosilanes was characterized by FTIR and NMR spectroscopies. Figure 1 represents FTIR
spectra of HNTs, P-HNTs, and S-HNTs, indicating the presence of two
well-defined peaks at 3621 and 3697 cm–1 owing to
the stretching vibrations of inner hydroxyl and inner surface hydroxyl
groups, respectively.23 Three new bands
at 1556, 2935, and 3453 cm–1 were observed in case
of P-HNTs and S-HNTs for N–H deformation and stretching vibrations
of C–H and N–H, respectively, signifying grafting of
aminosilanes.24,25

Figure 1 FTIR spectra of HNTs, P-HNTs, and S-HNTs.
The FTIR spectra of P-HNTs
and S-HNTs demonstrate the presence of amino groups in the nanocomposites
due to the grafting of aminosilanes onto the surface of HNTs.

Grafting of 3-(Aminopropyl)triethoxysilane and Trimethoxy[3-(methylamino)propyl]silane
over the Outer Surfaces of HNTs, Respectively
Additionally, we have performed solid-state 29Si NMR
spectroscopy to further demonstrate the grafting of these aminosilanes
over the surface of HNTs. 29Si cross polarization magic
angle spinning (CP-MAS) NMR spectra of HNTs and P-HNTs are illustrated
in Figure 2. In 29Si CP-MAS NMR spectra, the chemical shift at −91 ppm
arises from the constituent silicon present in HNTs, P-HNTs, and S-HNTs.
The appearance of a new peak at −67 ppm in both P-HNTs and
S-HNTs (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information)
is due to the tridentate (T3)-bonded silicon, indicating
the formation of a new chemical bond between the surface hydroxyl
groups of HNTs and the organosilanes.26

Figure 2 29Si CP-MAS NMR spectra of HNTs and P-HNTs.

Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM)
images of HNTs,
P-HNTs, and S-HNTs are shown in Figure 3. HNTs are composed of cylindrical-shaped tubes having
lengths between 1.0 and 1.5 μm with outer and inner diameters
of 50–100 and 15–20 nm, respectively, demonstrating
polydispersity in their sizes. The morphologies of P-HNTs and S-HNTs
are analogous to the morphology of pristine HNTs even after grafting
of aminosilanes. X-ray diffraction pattern (XRD) of HNTs is similar
to that of P-HNTs or S-HNTs (Figure S2).
The characteristic (001) reflection remains unaltered after grafting
of organosilanes, further demonstrating the absence of any intercalation
of aminosilane into the interlayer of HNTs.26,27 The specific surface areas assessed by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method were found to be 22 and 19 m2 g–1 for P-HNTs and S-HNTs, respectively. The isotherms of the adsorbents
are of type II with H3 hysteresis loops (Figure S3) according to IUPAC classification, representing the signature
of mesoporous materials. Finally, CHN elemental analysis was carried
out to achieve the exact concentration of grafted amino groups in
P-HNTs and S-HNTs. The loaded N was assessed to be 0.51 and 0.53 wt
% in P-HNTs and S-HNTs, respectively, under the present experimental
condition. These organosilane-functionalized surfaces of HNTs are
stable enough and impervious to remove the aminosilanes from the surface
by any organic solvents or water.

Figure 3 FESEM images of (A) HNTs, (B) P-HNTs,
and (C) S-HNTs, indicating
that they are composed of cylindrical-shaped tubes with no change
in their morphology even after grafting of aminosilanes.

2.2 Mercury Adsorption Study
To explore
the adsorption capacity of the NCs, mercury-containing aqueous solution
was considered as a pollutant, since mercury has been established
as one of the most harmful pollutants in the environment owing to
its high toxicity, volatility, and bioaccumulation. The adsorption
kinetics describing Hg(II) uptake rate was governed by the contact
time during adsorption reaction, which in turn determines the efficiency
of Hg(II) sorption of these adsorbents. To study the adsorption kinetics,
the reaction mixture was equilibrated at room temperature and then
the amount of Hg(II) ions adsorbed by P-HNTs and S-HNTs was estimated
as a function of time. We found that the apparent adsorption equilibrium
reached around 60 min of the adsorption process, after which no significant
change in adsorption capacity was observed even up to 2 h (Figure 4). The adsorption
kinetics of Hg(II) ions was then studied based on the pseudo-first-order
and pseudo-second-order rate equations28,29 1   2  where Qe is the
equilibrium adsorption capacity of an adsorbent (mg g–1), Qt is the amount
of adsorbate (mg g–1) at time t, k1 is the pseudo-first-order reaction
rate constant (min–1), and k2 is the rate constant for pseudo-second-order reaction (g
mg–1 min–1). In Table 1, we have summarized kinetic
parameters for Hg(II) adsorption based on the pseudo-first-order and
pseudo-second-order models. On the basis of the extracted correlation
coefficient (R2), the adsorption kinetics
of Hg(II) follows pseudo-second-order model for both P-HNTs and S-HNTs,
where the chemical adsorption process is the rate-limiting step. Again, Qe values obtained from the pseudo-second-order
model fitting are comparable to the experimental values, further suggesting
pseudo-second-order adsorption kinetics of Hg(II).

Hg(II) for both (A) P-HNTs and (B) S-HNTs,
representing that both P-HNTs and S-HNTs follow pseudo-second-order
adsorption model.

FTIR analysis
was performed after the adsorption of Hg(II) ions
over the surface of P-HNTs and S-HNTs (Figure S4), which demonstrated that the stretching and deformation
vibrations of N–H at 3453 and 1556 cm–1 were
shifted to 3438 and 1546 cm–1, respectively, authenticating
an interaction of Hg(II) ions with the adsorption sites (−NH2 or −NHR) present in the adsorbents. The probable mechanism
behind the binding of toxic Hg(II) ions is attributed to the metal–ligand
complex formation between Hg(II) and the reactive functional groups
(−NH2 or −NHR) of the adsorbents, since they
provide effective adsorption sites, as shown in Scheme 2. Again, Hg(II) ions prefer to coordinate
with amine sites, resulting in a strong coordination with Hg(II) ions.

Scheme 2 Schematic Presentation of the Probable Mechanism of the Binding of
Toxic Hg(II) Ions with the Reactive Functional Groups (−NH2 or −NHR) Present in the Adsorbents
To demonstrate the adsorption isotherm of Hg(II),
multiple sets
of batch experiments were carried out at room temperature for P-HNTs
and S-HNTs. The adsorption isotherm of Hg(II) was studied to indicate
the binding properties, as shown in Figure 5. Both the adsorption isotherms initially
showed a very sharp increase, signifying high-energy adsorption sites
that facilitate strong adsorption at low equilibrium concentrations.
The resultant data sets on mercury ion removal were fitted according
to Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models30,31 3   4  where Qe is the
equilibrium adsorption capacity of an adsorbent, Qm is the maximum adsorption capacity of that adsorbent
(mg g–1), Ce is the
equilibrium concentration of adsorbate (mg L–1), KL is the Langmuir equilibrium constant (L mg–1) associated to the free energy of adsorption, KF is the Freundlich equilibrium constant (mg
g–1)(L mg–1)1/n, and n is the adsorption equilibrium constant.
It is well known that Freundlich equilibrium isotherm demonstrates
multilayer adsorption with interaction between adsorbed molecules
and is related to the heterogeneous surfaces, whereas Langmuir isotherm
describes the monolayer coverage of the adsorbate and valid for dynamic
equilibrium adsorption over a homogeneous adsorbent surface.32,33 Thus, Langmuir isotherm suggests adsorption on a homogeneous surface
with uniform energy by monolayer coverage without any interaction
between adsorbed ions, whereas different sites with several adsorption
energies are involved in case of Freundlich isotherm. The Langmuir
and Freundlich model parameters obtained for each adsorbent after
fitted with experimental data are summarized in Table 2. It is interesting to note that the correlation
coefficient obtained from the Langmuir model was better fitted than
that from the Freundlich isotherm for mercury ions, suggesting a characteristic
monolayer molecular adsorption of Hg(II) ions over the surfaces of
P-HNTs and S-HNTs. The maximum adsorption capacities (Qm) of P-HNTs and S-HNTs for Hg(II) were estimated to be
83.48 and 45.22 mg g–1, respectively, indicating
the higher adsorption capacity of P-HNTs for Hg(II) ions than that
of S-HNTs. It should be pointed out that P-HNTs consist of primary
amine sites, whereas S-HNTs are composed of secondary amine sites.
Thus, the lower adsorption capacity of S-HNTs for Hg(II) ions is possibly
due to the little interaction of the adsorbate with the secondary
amines during the adsorption process, since amino groups present in
the adsorbent are the effective adsorption sites.

and (B) S-HNTs, demonstrating monolayer coverage of the adsorbate.

2.3 Temperature Dependence of Adsorption Capacity:
Kinetic and Thermodynamic Study
Temperature-dependent adsorption
kinetics of these adsorbents was performed by carrying out the adsorption
experiment in different temperatures, keeping all other experimental
conditions unaltered. Figure 6A presents the change in the adsorption capacities of P-HNTs
and S-HNTs as a function of temperature. The maximum adsorption was
noted around 40 °C. To determine spontaneous adsorption process,
it is necessary to consider both the enthalpy and free-energy change.
The free-energy change can be obtained from the equilibrium constant
(Kd), which is estimated experimentally.
The overall reaction equilibrium constant (Kd) can be obtained from the experiment as 5  where V is the
working volume
in milliliter, W is the adsorbent mass in grams,
and C0 and Ce are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of the adsorbate,
respectively.

Figure 6 (A) Plot of adsorption capacity of P-HNTs and S-HNTs as
a function
of temperature and (B) the corresponding ln Kd vs 1/T plot.

The plot of ln Kd vs 1/T is shown in Figure 6B, from which one can subsequently measure the enthalpy change
(ΔH0) and entropy change (ΔS0), as shown in Tables 3 and 4. How the free-energy
change is affected due to endothermicity and disorderness of a process
can be determined by the following equation 6   7  where R is the gas constant
(8.314 J mol–1 K–1), T is the absolute temperature in kelvin (K), and Kd is the equilibrium constant in mL g–1. As equilibrium constant (Kd) can be
obtained experimentally from Kd = Qe/Ce for various
temperatures, one can find −ΔH0/R as the slope and ΔS0/R as the intercept from ln Kd vs 1/T plot.

For a spontaneous process, ΔG0 is negative, which is a resultant of ΔH0 and TΔS0, where ΔH0 as positive
means endothermicity and positive intercept means ΔS0 positive as an increase in randomness happens. This
is due to the fact that Hg(ll) adsorbs to the primary or secondary
amine structure relative to its standard state. At higher temperatures
above 40 °C, the surface adsorption of Hg actually governs the
overall temperature dependence of rate.

2.4 Relation
between Kinetics and Thermodynamics
The pseudo-second-order
rate of the overall adsorption reaction, rd, can be written as 8  where rs is the
rate proportional to the number of Hg atoms adsorbed on the surface
and rc is the rate proportional to the
number of Hg atoms involved in the primary or secondary amine complexation.
Usually, adsorption of Hg on the surface of an adsorbent is an adsorption
process governed by the rate 9   10  where ΔGS≠ is change
in free energy of activation of adsorption process, rs0 depends
on the number of Hg atoms on the adsorbent, ΔGC≠ is
the amount of energy of interaction due to amine complexation with
Hg, and rc0 is proportional to the number or size of Hg–amine
complexes.

However, the critical size of the amine complexation
actually controls the lowering of the thermal activation energy barrier
of the adsorption process from the adsorbent. So, the overall adsorption
rate, rd, can be written from the collision
theory as 11  where f is a proportionality
constant, which depends on the frequency factor of collision of Hg
with the adsorbent and includes other approximate rate factors independent
of temperature. The breaking of Hg–amine complex is also a
thermally activated process, where the activation energy is negative
of the interaction energy to make the appropriate size of the Hg–amine
complex formation. We consider the overall process as

Hg(II)+
adsorbent  adsorbed Hg–amine
complex on the
adsorbent so that 12  As the kb is not
affected by the Hg–amine complexation interaction energy, Kd is affected only by ΔGC≠ in
ΔG0. The free energy of activation
for the adsorption of Hg–amine complex is given by 13  But the backward activation process, ΔGb≠, does not
depend on the complexation so that 14  where ΔGads≠ is the
free-energy change only due to the Hg(II) surface adsorption process.
The mechanism of temperature-dependent adsorption process is very
similar in primary and secondary amine cases except the fact that
the primary amine complexation is more favored than the secondary
one at any temperature by the obvious reason of steric hindrance on
the surface.

At lower temperatures below 40 °C, one can
find ΔGC≠ > ΔGS≠. At 40
°C, ΔGC≠ is
almost zero and the value of ln Kd falls on the normal adsorption straight line with 1/T at higher temperature. Below 40 °C, (ΔGS≠ –
ΔGC≠) is negative, so ln Kd increases with increasing 1/T. However, it is beyond our limit to demonstrate the temperature
dependence of decomplexation or decrease in size of the Hg–amine
complex with increase in temperature from the present experiment.
In the high-temperature range (>40 °C), from the straight
line
curve with positive slope, one finds ΔH0 as negative. Hg adsorption is an exothermic process and ΔS0 is negative, i.e., disorderness decreases.
Therefore, the decrease in the adsorption capacity of our adsorbents
at high temperature is possibly due to the weakening of the interaction
between the active sites of the adsorbents and adsorbate.32−34 However, in the lower-temperature range (<40 °C), straight
line curve with negative slope ΔH0 of the amine–Hg complexation is positive, indicating an endothermic
process, whereas ΔS0 is positive,
so disorderness increases due to the complexation process, which is
also supported by the experimental data (Tables 3 and 4).

2.5 Adsorption of Different Toxic Metals
In addition to
Hg(II), we have studied the adsorption kinetics of
P-HNTs and S-HNTs for several toxic metals [Cd(II), Pb(II), and Cu(II)]
present in the aqueous solution, keeping all of the experimental conditions
unaltered. The functional groups of the adsorbent and the adsorbate
(metal ions) play an important role in the adsorption process, which
in turn regulate the adsorption efficiency of the adsorbent. From Figure 7A, it can be found
that the uptake of Hg(ll) from aqueous solution by both P-HNTs and
S-HNTs is remarkably higher than that of other metal ions, demonstrating
insignificant adsorption of these metal ions possibly due to the physicochemical
properties of the metal ions, such as electronegativity and ionic
radius. Hence, we may conclude that P-HNTs has exceptional selectivity
for Hg(II) adsorption and is capable of removing them from aqueous
solution. The stability and recyclability of P-HNTs and S-HNTs were
demonstrated by carrying out a number of adsorption/desorption experiments
using 10% thiourea in 0.05 M HCl solution as an eluent. After successive
regeneration, the uptake efficiencies of these adsorbents were found
to be almost the same up to six cycles (Figure 7B). After the sixth cycle, a slight decrease
in adsorption efficacy was observed both for P-HNTs and S-HNTs, which
is possibly due to the irreversible adsorption of Hg(II) or may be
due to the oxidation of amino groups during repetitive adsorption
experiments.

Figure 7 (A) Adsorption efficiencies of P-HNTs and S-HNTs toward
different
adsorbates (200 mg L–1) and (B) their uptake efficacies
for Hg(II) after repetitive cyclic experiments.

2.6 Effect of Solution pH
It is important
to note that the solution pH imparts a significant role during the
adsorption process of Hg(II). To demonstrate pH-dependent adsorption
capacity of both P-HNTs and S-HNTs, we have carried out the adsorption
study in the pH range of 2–11, as shown in Figure 8A. With increasing solution
pH from 2 to 7, the adsorption capacity of these adsorbents for Hg(II)
ion increased notably and became the highest at pH 7. This is possible
due to the higher concentration of hydrogen ions at lower pH, which
results in the protonation of the amino groups, leading to the weak
binding ability of amino groups toward Hg(II) ions at lower pH. Additionally,
a competitive adsorption between Hg(II) ions and hydrogen ions with
the amine-binding sites of the adsorbents occurs at low pH, which
further encumbers the sequestration of Hg(II) ions. At higher pH (>7),
an increase in the adsorption efficiency of the adsorbents should
occur since the deprotonated amines are available for binding with
Hg(II). This observation has also been corroborated with our experimental
findings for zero-point-charge pH (pHzpc). It should be
noted that pHzpc is an important factor during adsorption
of ionic species, where the adsorbent surface has net electrical neutrality. Figure 8B depicts the pHzpc of both P-HNTs and S-HNTs. The pHpzc of P-HNTs
was estimated to be 7.6, whereas it is 7.2 for S-HNTs. Therefore,
pH > pHpzc, and the surface of the adsorbents should
be
negatively charged, which may facilitate the adsorption of cationic
species. However, a decrease in adsorption efficacy was observed for
both the adsorbents. This may be due to the formation of Hg(OH)3– complex with increasing concentration
of hydroxyl ions in the solution,35,36 resulting
in an electrostatic repulsion between the lone pair of nitrogen of
amino groups with the negatively charged metal complexes and leading
to the lowering of the Hg adsorption efficiency of the adsorbents.

capacity of P-HNTs and S-HNTs estimated in the pH
range of 2–11, with Hg(II) solution concentration of 200 mg
L–1. (B) pH at zero point charge (pHzpc) for P-HNTs and S-HNTs.

Finally, we have compared Hg(II) the uptake efficiency of
P-HNTs
to that of the reported amine-based adsorbents (Table S1), illustrating significant adsorption efficacy of
the former. Thus, exceptional sorption capacity together with easy
synthetic route to achieve these nanocomposites may be an alternative
pathway for developing prospective adsorbents to capture toxic metals
present in drinking water (Scheme 3).

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, we have fabricated two hybrid nanocomposites containing
primary or secondary amine site to explore them as cost-effective
sorbents for the removal of toxic heavy-metal ions from aqueous solution.
The adsorption kinetics of Hg(II) ions follows pseudo-second-order
rate equation compared to the pseudo-first-order model. The adsorption
isotherms were well fitted with the Langmuir isotherm model with a
high value of correlation coefficient compared to the Freundlich isotherm
model, confirming monolayer adsorption of the mercury ions on the
surface of amine-functionalized clay nanomaterials. With increasing
solution pH, the adsorption efficiencies of these adsorbents for Hg(II)
ion increased up to pH 7, followed by a gradual decrease in alkaline
pH. Thermodynamic analysis indicates that Hg(II)-ion adsorption by
these adsorbents is highly favorable, spontaneous, and endothermic
in nature at low temperature, further corroborated by theoretical
study. All of the adsorbents showed excellent adsorption capacity
even at low concentration and multicycle Hg(II) uptake capability;
however, P-HNTs possess the highest uptake capability among them.
Owing to the outstanding adsorption efficiency and good recyclability,
these nanocomposites may be explored as an adsorbent for industrial
heavy-metal-contaminated wastewater treatment, which in turn may find
application in the field of environmental remediation.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Synthesis of Inorganic–Organic
Hybrid
Nanocomposites
Inorganic–organic hybrid NCs were synthesized
by grafting of organosilanes over the outer surfaces of HNTs.37 The grafting reaction was performed under nitrogen
atmosphere by a standard air-free technique. A 50 mL three-necked
round-bottom flask containing 15.0 mL of toluene was fixed with a
rubber septum, condenser, and a thermocouple adapter. And 3.0 g of
HNTs was added to the flask. The reaction mixture was deaerated for
30 min under nitrogen at room temperature, followed by heating with
a heating mantle. Then, aminosilane (6.0 mmol) was injected into the
flask at 60 °C under stirring condition, and subsequently, the
reaction mixture was heated to 120 °C and refluxed for 20 h at
that temperature. Finally, the as-synthesized product was collected
through filtration, washed several times with toluene and ethanol
separately to remove unreacted aminosilanes, if any, and then dried
at 100 °C overnight under vacuum. The products were abbreviated
as P-HNTs and S-HNTs for 3-(aminopropyl)triethoxysilane- and trimethoxy[3-(methylamino)propyl]silane-functionalized
HNTs, respectively, and explored them as adsorbent to capture toxic
metal ions.

4.2 Batch Adsorption Study
Using Nanocomposites
To demonstrate the adsorption capacity
of these NCs toward toxic
metal ions from aqueous solution, Hg(II) solution was taken in a beaker
containing P-HNTs or S-HNTs. Adsorption experiments were carried out
taking different concentrations of Hg(II) solution, and the adsorbent
concentration was maintained at 3.0 g L–1. The solution
was stirred on a magnetic stirrer up to a desired time and then the
solution was filtered off once the adsorption was over and collected
for further study. The resulting solutions were analyzed by inductive
coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). The amount
of unbound Hg(II) ions present in the filtrate was also estimated
using diphenylthiocarbazone (dithizone), which formed a complex with
Hg(II) ions. The absorption spectra of mercury–dithizone complexes
were recorded using a UV–visible spectrophotometer in a standard
quartz cuvette of 1 cm path length. pH-dependent adsorption analysis
was performed for both P-HNTs and S-HNTs in the pH range of 2–11,
and the solution pH was adjusted to the desired value by adding either
HCl or NaOH. All of the isotherms and kinetics were carried out at
pH 4 at 25 °C. For adsorption kinetics and pH study, the initial
concentration of Hg(II) solution was taken to be 200 mg L–1 with an adsorbent concentration of 3.0 g L–1.
For the regeneration and reuse of the NCs, the used P-HNTs and S-HNTs
were treated with 10% thiourea in 0.05 M HCl solution for 2 h and
then washed with plenty of water. After being regenerated, the adsorbents
were added into the Hg(II) solution to check their reusability. Keeping
all of the experimental conditions unaltered, we have also studied
the adsorption capacities of these NCs for other heavy-metal ions
[Cd(II), Pb(II), and Cu(II)] present in the aqueous solution.

4.3 Determination of pH at Zero Point Charge (pHzpc)
The zero point charge pH (pHzpc) values
of P-HNTs and S-HNTs were calculated by the pH drift method. In this
method, the pHzpc of the adsorbent was estimated by adding
10 mL of 0.05 M NaCl solution to several vials (15 mL) and the pH
was adjusted to a desired value (range, 2–12) by adding aqueous
solutions of either HCl or NaOH. Then, 0.03 g of the adsorbent was
added to each vial and closed properly and mixed well using a vortexer
for 30 min. After that, the vials were allowed to equilibrate for
48 h at room temperature. The suspensions were centrifuged to measure
the final pH of the supernatant. The difference between the final
and initial pH (ΔpH) was plotted against initial pH. The point
of intersection of the resulting curve at which ΔpH = 0 gives
rise to the exact value of pHzpc of an adsorbent.

4.4 Characterization
Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded in the range of 500–4000
cm–1 using JASCO FT/IR 6300. The number of scans
was fixed to 50 with a resolution of 2 cm–1. All
of the FTIR spectra were recorded in the transmission mode. The solid-state 29Si cross-polarization magic angle spinning (CP-MAS) NMR spectra
were obtained using a JEOL JNM-ECX400II spectrometer. Powder X-ray
diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried out using a Rigaku MiniFlex
II powder diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation with a beam voltage
of 35 kV and a beam current of 15 mA. The morphology of HNTs was characterized
by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM: FEI QUANTA
FEG 250) after drop-casting a solution on silicon wafer. Specific
surface area was estimated by the BET method using nitrogen adsorption/desorption
isotherms at 77 K with a 3Flex Micromeritics analyzer. CHN analysis
was done using a PerkinElmer 2400 Series II CHNS Elemental Analyzer.
UV–visible absorption spectroscopy was conducted at 25 °C
using Shimadzu spectrophotometer UV-2600 to estimate the concentration
of metal ions present in the solutions. Inductively coupled plasma
optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) measurements were also carried
out using the PerkinElmer ICP-OES instrument (PerkinElmer, Inc., Shelton,
CT) to verify the result obtained from UV–visible spectroscopy.
pH-dependent adsorption study was carried out using a Mettler Toledo
FEP20 pH Meter.
