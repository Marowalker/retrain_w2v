The thermal reverse flow reactor
is an effective technical equipment
for dealing with ventilation air methane, which has been causing a
significant greenhouse effect. An experimental study on the thermal
oxidation of ventilation air methane in a thermal reverse flow reactor
was conducted. A mixture of domestic gas and ambient air was used
to simulate ventilation air methane in the experiments, and the methane
conversion efficiency was analyzed based on the concentration of combustion
products determined by gas chromatography equipment. In addition,
the effects of the switching time, the inlet methane concentration,
the flow rate, and heat extraction were studied. The experimental
results show that the reverse flow reactor system can run under a
wide range of operating conditions with autothermal operation and
high methane conversion. In addition, this system can even work with
methane concentrations as low as 0.30% in the autothermal operation
mode without NOx emission. Unlike previous
studies, this study shows that the flow rate has little effect on
the methane conversion rate in the cyclic steady state over a wide
range of operating conditions. In addition, methane conversion and
reaction zone change as the inlet methane concentration varies during
the reaction process in the cyclic steady state. The combined optimization
of operating parameters can effectively improve the stability of the
reverse flow reactor system and methane conversion efficiency.

1 Introduction
A large quantity of methane
is discharged into the air from coal
mines each year, 70% of which is emitted by ventilation air methane
(VAM)—methane emitted with mine venting flow, with more than
20 billion cubic meters per year in China.1 In addition to the environmental issue, as a kind of gas fuel, coal
mine methane (CMM) emission also causes waste of energy resources.
Three types of CMM exist: (1) VAM, with a methane concentration of
0.1–1%; (2) methane drained from the seam before mining, with
a methane concentration of 60–95%; and (3) methane from worked
areas of the mine, usually with a methane concentration of 30–95%.2 Because VAM contributes most emissions to the
atmosphere from gassy coal mines,3 how
to collect and utilize the VAM in an efficient way has great significance
for the environment and energy resources. Because of its dilute concentration,
very large air volume, and variable flow rate, VAM cannot be burned
using traditional combustion devices except as combustible air, and
solving this near-limit combustion problem is still a great challenge.

After decades of continuous efforts, great progress has been made
in this field. Currently, the main processing technologies include
thermal or catalytic reverse flow reactors (RFRs)-a kind of reactor
relying on flow reversal after a period repeatedly for autothermal
operation, recuperative gas turbines, and catalytic monolith reactors.4 Among these technologies, the RFR is considered
to be one of the most promising because of its superiority in dealing
with dilute fuel gas with a high flow rate below the lean flammability
limit in autothermal operation with a relative low cost.

RFRs
have been widely investigated for the combustion of methane.
We learned that the first RFR system for combustion of a dilute methane/air
gas mixture was proposed by Gogin et al. from Gosiewski’s paper,5. A series of studies on catalytic RFR (named
CH4MIN) applications for the oxidation of lean methane
from coal mine emissions was conducted by CanmetENERGY, with a capacity
of 900 m3/h, a minimum VAM concentration requirement of
0.15% and a methane removal efficiency of 95%.6 A thermal RFR product with a horizontal single bed structure was
produced by the MEGTEC Company, with a capacity of 125 thousand m3/h, a minimum VAM concentration requirement of 0.2% and a
methane removal efficiency of 97%.7 In
addition, VAM combustion research has been undertaken by Gosiewski
and Pawlaczyk et al. since 2001, with a catalytic RFR and a thermal
RFR produced by them.8

Compared to
a catalytic RFR9−13 (with the use of a catalyst in addition to inert ceramics), a thermal
RFR is a better and less expensive solution when the VAM concentration
is high,14 and this RFR has been more commonly
used.15−17

Even though many projects on thermal RFRs for
VAM or dilute methane
have been carried out,18 much progress
remains to be made in terms of the theory of thermal RFRs for methane.
In addition, previous studies are mainly focused on the operating
temperature profile, autothermal concentration, dilute methane combustion
mechanism, and so on.

In the view of the thermal RFR operating
temperature profile and
autothermal operation, Gosiewski and Pawlaczyk19 estimated that a thermal RFR for methane combustion requires
an adiabatic temperature increase of ∼265 °C per 1 CH4 vol %, which means that VAM combustion in a thermal RFR should
be autothermal for CH4 concentrations above ∼0.19
vol %, with the maximum temperature below 1100 °C. Lan and Li20 concluded that the minimum concentration of
methane in a thermal RFR would be as low as 0.18% with a maximum temperature
of over 1127 °C based on three-dimensional numerical investigation
and analyzed the effect of the homogeneous flow channel length on
the thermal combustion of dilute methane.

In a study of the
dilute methane thermal oxidation reaction mechanism,
Wang et al.21 developed a reduced two-step
mechanism to describe methane combustion in a monolith packed reactor
and an empty reactor based on a homogeneous combustion experimental
investigation of dilute methane/air mixtures in reactors packed with
and without a monolith. Slepterev et al.22 carried out experiments on the homogeneous deep oxidation reaction
mechanism of lean methane mixtures in fixed beds of ceramic spheres,
considered that the methane oxidation occurs via a consecutive scheme
of CO formation, found that CO oxidation is visibly inhibited by methane,
and presented recommended kinetic equations and parameters. Extensive
research has shown that the selectivity of methane oxidation to CO
reaches 70–90%, passing through a maximum with increasing temperature,
while the degree of methane conversion depends on the reactor packing
and diameter.23 Pawlaczyk and Gosiewski24 studied the kinetics of dilute methane thermal
combustion in monolith materials and put forward a method for calculating
the reaction rate combining low-temperature kinetic parameters and
high-temperature kinetic parameters for further simulation studies.
In addition, Pawlaczyk and Gosiewski25 concluded
that the combustion mechanism in monolith layers includes a combination
of heterogeneous surface combustion and homogeneous combustion in
the gas phase through experimental research, and the contributions
of the two mechanisms depend on the temperature.

To date, no
detailed mechanisms, nor skeletal/reduced mechanisms,
for ultra-lean mixtures under ambient pressure conditions have been
well established.3 The studies on the kinetics
of dilute methane in honeycomb ceramics under ambient pressure conditions
are insufficient, and the correction and accuracy of the previous
RFR simulation results based on immature mechanisms do not provide
satisfactory guidance for the optimization design of lab-scale, much
less industrial-scale, thermal RFRs, especially under the condition
of heat recovery by extracting heat from the RFR. Additionally, systematic
experiments of a bench-scale thermal RFR to analyze the effect of
single factors, such as the VAM concentration and flow rate, on the
RFR temperature, methane conversion, and system stability have not
been thoroughly investigated.

In this paper, an experimental
thermal RFR system is designed for
verification of the thermal oxidation of VAM, with heat recovery (through
a hot water medium) realized by extracting hot flue gas from the RFR.
The impacts of single operating parameters (inlet VAM concentration,
switching time, flow rate, and so forth.) on the methane conversion
and temperature profile during the entire process are analyzed to
reveal the combustion characteristics of the thermal RFR, and some
valuable conclusions are provided.

2 Experimental
Section
2.1 Experimental System
An experimental
device was constructed to test the VAM thermal oxidation performance
under different operating conditions, as shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Schematic diagram of
the VAM reverse flow thermal oxidation experimental
rig: 1, domestic gas valve; 2, mixer; 3, ambient air valve; 4, filter;
5, fan; 6–7, switching valve; 8, stack; 9–10, inert
ceramic layers; 11, combustion room; 12–13, electric heating
elements; 14, thermal insulation layer; 15, heat exchanger; 16, water
pump; 17, reservoir; 18, flue gas extraction valve; Ⓣ, thermocouple;
Ⓒ, concentration detector.

The main structure of the RFR is divided into inert ceramic layers
I, the combustion room, and inert ceramic layers II. In addition,
the power of the electric heating elements arranged in the combustion
room is 20 kW, with the purpose of preheating ceramic layers I and
the combustion room in the start-up period of the RFR.

Each
cycle of thermal oxidation of VAM in the RFR involves two
reverse half cycles: the first half cycle flow direction is ceramic
layers I → combustion room → ceramic layers II, and
the second half cycle flow direction is reversed. During the first
half cycle, switching valve I is in the state of the inlet being connected
to the VAM flow and switching valve II is in the state of the outlet
being opened to the stack. Thus, the VAM mixture flows through the
RFR from the left to ceramic layers I, is heated to over the methane
ignition temperature, and is then oxidized in the combustion room.
The combusted gas continues to flow through ceramic layers II, extracts
heat energy from the ceramics, leaves the RFR and enters the stack,
passing through switching valve II.

In the reverse flow half
cycle, the flow direction of the VAM in
the RFR is reversed by flipping switching valve I and switching valve
II. The VAM mixture flows through the RFR from the bottom right of
ceramic layers II, is heated to over the methane ignition temperature
in ceramic layers II, is oxidized in the combustion room, and is transported
to heat ceramic layers I in the form of combustion flue gas.

The shell of the RFR is made of carbon steel to allow operation
beyond the temperature of 800 °C, with an actual operating temperature
of 30–100 °C during the experimental process. The thickness
of the RFR steel wall is 0.01 m, with a density of 7.85 × 103 kg/m3, a specific heat capacity of 460 J/kg/°C,
and a thermal conductivity of 13.6 W/m/°C. A thermal insulation
layer with a thickness of 0.2 m, arranged between the shell and the
ceramics to reduce the heat loss of the RFR, is also fixed between
the steel shell and the combustion room of the RFR. The thickness
of the insulation is 0.2 m, with a density of 130 kg/m3 and a specific heat capacity of 1010 J/kg/°C.

The main
characteristics of the honeycomb ceramics are as follows:
total size, 0.3 ×0.3 × 0.1 m; pore fraction, 56.25%; specific
surface area, 750 m2/m3; pore size, 0.003 ×
0.003 m; channel wall thickness, 0.001 m; packing density, 0.85 ×
103 kg/m3; density, 2.5 × 103 kg/m3; specific heat capacity, 850–1100 J/kg/°C;
thermal conductivity, 1.5–2.3 W/m/°C; and maximum allowable
temperature for long periods, less than 1200 °C. The commercial
honeycomb ceramics used in the experiments are composed of cordierite,
with a cuboid shape.

Before operation, the inert ceramic beds
are preheated to a certain
temperature above the methane ignition temperature by two sets of
electric heating elements fixed on the middle wall of the combustion
room.

Two thermocouples are used to measure the temperature
of the mixture
gas at the inlet and outlet of the RFR. A total of four thermocouples
are placed in different layers of the inert ceramics near the thermal
insulation wall to obtain the temperature profiles of the preheated
section. A total of three thermocouples are used to measure the temperature
of the combustion room of the RFR. Meanwhile, two thermocouples are
distributed in the inlet and outlet pipeline of the water loop of
the heat exchanger. For more accurate experimental results, the concentrations
of CH4 and NOx after combustion
in the RFR outlet are detected by gas chromatography.

The variation
in the methane content in the gas composition from
the inlet to the outlet of the RFR, the period that single direction
flow lasts, flow rate of VAM gas, and the flow rate of VAM gas that
directly discharges without oxidation are used to determine the efficiency
of thermal oxidation according to eqs 1 and 2, while eq 1 stands for average methane conversion
considering the influence of switching valve open/close action. 1   2  

2.2 Experimental Conditions
Switching
valves I and II, which control the RFR flow directions, are dominated
by time relays with a fixed time. The thermocouples used in the experiments
for measuring the temperature are K-type, with a precision of 0.5%
over the entire temperature range studied. The VAM is simulated by
a mixture of domestic gas and ambient air. The mixture is prepared
by controlling the methane concentration of the mixture at the inlet
of the RFR.

During the experimental processes, some gas composition
samples at the inlet and outlet of the RFR will be taken by the gas
sample bags for component analysis to calculate the methane conversion.

To guarantee the precision of the mixture, with the aim of simulating
VAM using domestic gas and ambient air, a special static mixer was
designed, and the pipe diameter for supplying the mixture gas was
selected as 0.2 m, with a pipe length of over 10 m after the mixer.
Before the actual thermal state experiment, the methane concentration
uniformity of the inlet VAM flow in the delivery pipe was tested by
a portable methane concentration detector. A pipe opening was made
at a distance from the mixer close to the inlet of the RFR, and the
probe of the detector was radially inserted into the pipe from the
opening to test the methane concentration at different points of the
same cross section of the VAM delivery pipe.

3 Results and Discussion
A series of experiments for evaluating
the VAM thermal oxidation
characteristics in the bench-scale thermal RFR were carried out, including
experiments on the system start-up process and the effects of the
switching time, inlet VAM, flow rate, and heat extraction on thermal
oxidation in the RFR.

To conveniently describe the temperature
profile of the RFR by
thermocouples from different heights in the ceramic layers and thermocouples
horizontally arranged in the combustion room in two-dimensional figures,
the vertical ceramic layers are unfolded in the horizontal direction,
and the left and right sides of the ceramic layers are placed at each
end of the combustion room. The total length of the RFR is easily
determined to be 5.2 m, as shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Axis-direction length of the RFR.

The experimental conditions and results are shown in Table 1 and Figure 3. In general, methane conversion
exceeding
96% can be observed. The main idea for investigating thermal oxidation
is to survey the temperature profile in the RFR, methane conversion,
and NOx emissions during the experiment.

Figure 3 Experimental
results under different conditions (inlet VAM concentration,
switching time, flow rate, and so forth.).

3.1 System Start-Up Characteristics
In
addition to the experiments listed in Table 1, we also carried
out experiments to study the start-up characteristics of the thermal
RFR for dealing with VAM via thermal oxidation.

Table 1 Experimental Conditions
item	unit	value	
VAM concentration	 	0.20–0.99%	
half cycle time	s	60–120	
flow rate (m3/h)	Nm3/h	500–1000	
First, the honeycomb ceramic layers are heated through
electric
heating elements. With the help of VAM flow switching, after approximately
6 h of electric heating, the temperature in the combustion room exceeds
700 °C, and the temperature in the upper layer of the honeycomb
ceramics is over 600 °C.

Second, the simulated VAM gas
(the inlet methane concentration CCH4,in is 0.35%, and the flow rate
is 500 Nm3/h) flows into the RFR, transfers some of the
heat in ceramic layers I to ceramic layers II through the VAM flow,
preheated, and combusted in the RFR. The methane concentration at
the outlet of the RFR in several initial reverse flow cycles of this
step can be seen in Figure 4. The methane conversion  is strongly
related to the temperature
profile in the honeycomb ceramic layers.  changes rapidly
in the initial cycles.
Each half cycle time tc is 90 s. As the
RFR runs continuously, the entire temperature in the RFR gradually
increases under the two reverse flow directions. Finally, the system
reaches the autothermal state under this condition. In subsequent
cycles, flow reversal begins to repeat the previous behavior, called
the cyclic steady state (CSS). In addition, the system reaches a high
methane conversion  (above 96%) after 90 min of the reverse
flow process. No NOx is found in the gas
samples at the outlet of the RFR to the stack, with the highest temperature
in the RFR of 728 °C.

Figure 4 Temperature profile in the CSS for forward half
cycles. (A) 3D
visualization of the temperature profile. (B) 2D contour figure of
the temperature profile.

The temperature profiles
in the CSS at the end of the start-up
process in the forward half cycles are shown in Figure 4. The temperatures of the top layers of the
ceramics and the combustion room are above 600 °C, higher than
the methane ignition temperature of 538 °C. The temperature profiles
in the CSS do not appear to be unique because of slight fluctuations
in the inlet VAM concentration and the flow rate. Different inlet
VAM concentrations would have different temperature profiles to meet
different heat storage needs, which will be analyzed in the next section.

3.2 Effect of the Switching Time
Given
a constant flow rate and inlet VAM concentration, experiments to investigate
the effect of the switching time were carried out. The switching time
Tswitch can be evaluated by the following equation26 3  where Lhf is obtained
using eqs 4–6, and vhf is obtained
using eq 7 4   5   6   7  

The value of the switching time is
easily obtained from eqs 3–7 through mathematical calculation
and is approximately 268–921 s at the inlet VAM concentration
of 0.3–1.0%. To be conservative, we adopted a smaller switching
time range during experiments, from 60 to 120 s, to avoid combustion
reaction extinction.

Figure 5 shows the
temperature profile in the CSS for different switching times (called
the half cycle time, in which two switching times are needed for a
whole cycle) at the inlet VAM concentration of 0.46% and a flow rate
of 800 Nm3/h. As the switching time increases, the temperature
profile of ceramic layers I and II exhibits a downtrend, and the peak
temperature of the RFR decreases. The high temperature zone becomes
wider, the high temperature zone shifts toward the outlet side, and
the exhaust temperature increases slightly.

Figure 5 Temperature profile in
the CSS for different switching times in
a forward half cycle.

Meanwhile, thermal oxidation
gradually occurs in the top layers
of the ceramics, in addition to in the combustion room. If the switching
time is excessively increased, the high temperature zone will shift
to the outlet side of the RFR, augment the heat loss, and even result
in gradual combustion reaction extinction in the RFR. In contrast,
if the switching time is too short, the exhaust heat loss will be
reduced, with the disadvantage of shortening the valves’ service
life because of the frequent valve movement. We still find residual
methane rushing into the stack directly through the pipe connecting
the two switching valves when the flow direction is reversed.

We can determine that the methane conversion is only related to
the temperature of the combustion room. When the temperature of the
combustion room is above 700 °C, the methane can be almost totally
converted to CO2 and H2O.

According to
the experimental data of the inlet VAM concentration
and outlet VAM concentration under different switching time conditions
of 60, 90, and 120 s, we can obtain the methane conversions  through eq 2.

Additionally, we
can obtain the average methane conversion ηCH4, as shown in Figure 6, through eq 1 after calculating the pure methane volume that rushes
out when the switching control valve is opened or closed over 1 h,
as the volume rushing out can be estimated by the parameters in Section 2.1. Little difference
is found between methane conversion  for the switching
times of 60, 90, and
120 s, with the same trend observed for ηCH4. The switching time clearly has a significant influence on
the methane conversion in terms of lowering the average methane conversion
ηCH4, even though little difference is
found between the ηCH4 values for different
switching times.

Figure 6 Influence of the switching time on the methane conversion
in the
CSS.

No NOx was detected in the gas samples
at the outlet of the RFR to the stack, and the highest temperature
in the RFR was 810 °C at the time the gas samples were taken
for measurement.

3.3 Effect of the Inlet VAM
Concentration
Given a constant flow rate and switching time,
experiments to determine
the effect of the inlet VAM concentration were performed, with the
inlet VAM concentration ranging from 0.20 to 0.99%.

As the inlet
VAM concentration increases, the peak temperature of the RFR becomes
higher, and the high temperature zone becomes wider, as shown in Figure 7. The main reason
for this phenomenon is that a higher methane concentration in VAM
could result in more heat release from combustion. The peak temperature
of the RFR can reach 800 °C when the inlet VAM concentration
is above 0.6%, while this temperature drops to 700 °C when the
inlet VAM concentration is as low as 0.3%. The extracted portion of
hot flue gas can be used for producing hot water using a heat exchanger.

Figure 7 Temperature
profile in the CSS for different VAM concentrations
in a forward half cycle.

When the inlet VAM concentration
is 0.2%, the heat extracted from
the VAM combustion cannot maintain the autothermal operation of the
system (mainly counteracting the outlet flue gas heat loss and surface
heat dissipation), which would lead to gradual combustion reaction
extinction in the RFR. The temperature profile for 0.2% concentration
in Figure 7 actually
has a downtrend that leads to combustion reaction extinction in the
RFR. For the purpose of CSS comparison, the downtrend of the 0.2%
temperature profile is not shown in Figure 7.

The inlet VAM concentration will
not be suitable when it is set
too high, as the heat release rate will be much greater than the gas
flow rate, which would cause damage because of an explosion. From eq 6, we can determine that
the adiabatic temperature rise of the inlet VAM is 280.5 °C for
a methane concentration of 1.0%. The temperatures of the ceramic top
layers are commonly above 650 °C, and the temperature in the
combustion room can easily reach 900 °C if there is little flue
extraction from the RFR. Therefore, the inlet VAM concentration is
usually maintained below 1% for temperature control and safety purposes.

We learned from experiments that the RFR will be in autothermal
operation in the CSS above the VAM concentration of 0.30%; additionally,
the outlet methane concentration will remain low and decrease when
the inlet VAM concentration slightly increases. Because all of the
methane conversion values are approximately 96%, we can assume that
no clear differences exist between the methane conversion values  for different
inlet VAM concentrations
when the RFR is operating at a VAM concentration above 0.3%, as shown
in Figure 8.

Figure 8 Methane conversion
and outlet methane concentration for different
inlet VAM concentrations.

No NOx was found in the gas samples
at the outlet of the RFR when evaluating the methane conversion, with
the highest temperature in the RFR of 850 °C.

3.4 Effect of the Flow Rate
Given a constant
switching time and inlet VAM concentration, experiments to study the
effect of the flow rate were performed, with the flow rate fluctuating
from 500 to 1000 Nm3/h.

We carried out experiments
under the conditions of a VAM concentration of 0.75% and a switching
time of 120 s. We found that the peak temperature of the RFR rises
as the flow rate increases, similar to the effect of the inlet VAM
concentration on the RFR. When the RFR reaches the CSS, the temperature
profile has a tendency to move toward the outlet side as the flow
rate increases, as shown in Figure 9.

Figure 9 Temperature profile in the CSS for different VAM flows
in a forward
half cycle.

In a forward half cycle, the temperature
profile of the RFR gradually
moves toward the outlet side with increasing switching time, as shown
in Figure 10. We conclude
that the distance that the heat wave moves in the ceramic layers is
approximately 0.5 m from the position at the half cycle start for
a switching time of 120 s. This distance can be thought of as the
distance over which the same temperature transfers to each side of
the ceramic layers.

Figure 10 Temperature profile in the CSS for different switching
times in
a forward half cycle.

Even though the methane
conversion fluctuates as the flow rate
ranges from 500 to 1000 Nm3/h, it still remains above 95%,
and no clear trend is observed in the methane conversion fluctuation
as the flow rate increases, which means that the flow rate has little
influence on the methane conversion , as shown
in Figure 11. However,
we can see that average methane
conversion ηCH4 for a flow of 500 Nm3/h is obviously lower by more than 1% compared to the other
flow rates. A low flow rate appears to have some influence on the
average methane conversion ηCH4. In addition,
no NOx is found during this experiment,
with the highest temperature in the RFR of 830 °C.

Figure 11 Methane conversion
in the CSS for different flow rates.

3.5 Effect of Heat Extraction
Given a
constant flow rate and switching time, experiments to survey the effect
of heat extraction under different inlet VAM concentrations were implemented
as follows.

The principle of choosing the extraction flow rate
of flue gas is based on the autothermal operation of the RFR in the
CSS. In addition, the peak temperature in the RFR will clearly rise
if less high-temperature flue gas is extracted.

When the RFR
operates at a relatively high VAM concentration, such
as 0.75%, the combustion of methane could be in the autothermal mode
in the CSS of the RFR, and heat could be exported outside by flue
gas extraction at the same time, with the purpose of avoiding overheating
of the ceramic layers. The heat extraction experimental conditions
were as follows: flow rate, 800 Nm3/h; switching time,
90 s; VAM concentrations, 0.20, 0.30, 0.46, 0.60, 0.75, and 0.99%;
and water flow rate of the water-flue gas exchanger, 2.7 t/h.

The experimental result is shown in Figure 12. When the VAM concentration is 0.99%, the
flue temperature is 900 °C, the flue flow is 212 Nm3/h, and the water temperature will be able to rise 21.06 °C,
as measured by thermocouples in the water pipes. The flue temperature
represents the peak temperature of the RFR as the VAM concentration
changes. In addition, no NOx is found
during this experiment.

Figure 12 Heat extraction for different VAM concentrations.

4 Conclusions
(1) An appropriate
switching time is good
for the stability of RFR operation, especially at low inlet VAM concentrations,
and a switching time of 90–120 s is suitable as the half cycle
time according to experiments.

(2) The thermal RFR system can operate
over a wide range of inlet VAM concentrations with autothermal operation,
and the RFR can reach the CSS at a concentration as low as 0.30%.
The high temperature zone of the RFR becomes wider as the inlet VAM
concentration increases, which will be beneficial for the CSS. Even
though the outlet methane concentration decreases as the inlet VAM
concentration increases, no clear difference is observed between the
methane conversion values as the VAM concentration ranges from 0.3
to 0.99%, which means that the VAM concentration has a slight influence
on the methane conversion  in the CSS.

(3) The peak temperature of the RFR rises
as the flow rate increases in the CSS, and the temperature profile
has a tendency to move toward the outlet side at the same time. No
NOx is found in the outlet of the RFR
to the stack during the experiments with a maximum temperature in
the RFR of 850 °C. Temperature profile control of the thermal
RFR would be fundamental to thermal oxidation and reduction of NOx, and a more effective control strategy would
be essential for an industrial-scale RFR. A low flow rate has some
influence on the average methane conversion, and this phenomenon needs
to be considered when running an industrial-scale thermal RFR.

(4) The RFR can export heat
outside through
flue gas extraction when the RFR operates under a relatively high
VAM concentration in the CSS for the purpose of autothermal operation
and thermal utilization. The higher the VAM concentration is, the
higher the hot water temperature rise through the exchanger outside
the RFR.

(5) We determine
that the RFR can run
at concentrations above 0.30% in the CSS and have heat remaining for
utilization in the form of high temperature flue gas. A proper switching
time, peak temperature, and optimized length of the high temperature
zone need to be selected for stable operation.
