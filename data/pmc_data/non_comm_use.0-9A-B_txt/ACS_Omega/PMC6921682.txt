Novel tetracyanidonitridorhenium(V)
complexes with five-membered
N-heteroaromatic ligands, (PPh4)2[ReN(CN)4L] [L = imidazole (Him) (2), 1-methylimidazole
(Mim) (3), and pyrazole (pyz) (4)] and (PPh4)2[ReN(CN)4L]·L [L = Him (5) and Mim (6)], were synthesized by the reactions
of (PPh4)2[ReN(CN)4] (1) with Him, Mim, and pyz, and their structures were determined by
single-crystal X-ray analysis. The complexes 2, 3, 4, and 6 showed intense photoluminescence,
with the emission quantum yields (Φem) being 0.65–0.75 in the solid state
at 296 K. In contrast, the Φem and τem values of 5 are significantly smaller and shorter,
respectively, than the relevant values of 2. The interconversion
reactions among 1, 2, and 5 accompanied by large photoluminescence-intensity changes were accomplished
by solvent-free reactions and exposure of water. The mechanochemical
reaction of 2 with 1 mol equiv of Him in the solid state
gave 5. Complex 5 was also obtained by the
mechanochemical reaction of 1 with 2 mol equivalents
of Him in the solid state. By placing solid of 5 in water,
the solid showed intense photoluminescence to give 2.
Complex 1 was produced under vacuum at 185 °C from 2 or 5.

Introduction
A reversible photoluminescence
intensity on–off by external
stimuli and/or by a chemical reaction is attractive with respect to
development of sensing. It is a promising approach to apply a weak
interaction to construct the switch using a reversible chemical reaction.
Metal complexes have an advantage to be capable to use a weak coordination
bond as well as a hydrogen bond and an intermolecular interaction
for this purpose. We suppose that the control of the on–off
reaction using the weak interaction/bond in a solid state is sometimes
easier than that in a solution because thermal motion of the molecule
is restricted in the solid state. In practice, the reversible luminescence
color and/or intensity switching of metal complexes via mechanochemical
reactions have been studied extensively for d10 and d8 complexes.1−44 The driving force of luminescence intensity change in these complexes
was by change in intermolecular interactions such as the π–π
interaction. In contrast, the solid-based reversible reactions involving
drastic luminescence intensity change by change in the coordination
number and composition of the complex are still rare.

A nitridorhenium(V)
complex possesses a coordination site (axial
site) at the trans position of the nitrido, and the site is influenced
strongly by the trans effect of the nitrido.45−48 Therefore, the site is labile,
the sixth ligand is not necessary, and the five- and six-coordinate
complexes are both stable.49 In addition,
some types of the both five- and six-coordinate complexes show luminescence.49−58 In the tetracyanidonitridorhenium(V) complex, the emission quantum
yield of the five-coordinate complex is low (Φem <
0.01) and, thus, the complex is almost nonemissive by naked eyes.49 The six-coordinate complex shows intense luminescence
in the solid state at 296 K.49,58 Therefore, the luminescence
on–off reaction using the weak coordination site is promising
for the complex. We previously reported vapochromic luminescence of
soild tetracyanidonitridorhenium(V) by the changes in the coordination
number and coordinating volatile organic compounds such as acetone,
acetonitrile, ethanol, and methanol.49

In the present study, the new nitridorhenium(V) complexes with
five-membered N-heteroaromatic ligands, imidazole (Him), N-methylimidazole (Mim), and pyrazole (pyz) as shown in Figure 1 were synthesized and characterized
to investigate luminescence on–off properties for the tetracyanidonitridorhenium(V)
complex by changes in weak interactions. In the complexes having Him
and Mim, we succeeded in synthesizing two types of crystalline samples
depending on the reaction conditions: six-coordinate complexes and
also complexes including the additional one mole ratio of the N-heterocyclic
molecule. Most newly synthesized complexes showed strong luminescence
in the solid states at 296 K. Interestingly, we found that the Him-coordinated
complex including one mole ratio of noncoordinating Him in the crystal
was almost nonluminescent, while the Mim-coordinated complex containing
one mole ratio of noncoordinating Mim in the crystal was strongly
photoemissive. Luminescence-intensity changes between the five- and
six-coordinate complexes and between the six-coordinate complexes
with Him were investigated based on solvent-free mechanochemical and
vacuum elimination reactions and an exposure of water to the solid
complex. The origin of the luminescence intensity change is both formation/dissociation
of weak interactions and the coordination bond between tetracyanidonitridorhenium(V)
and Him.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis and Characterization of the Novel
Complexes
The new bright yellow-green luminescent six-coordinate
complexes,
(PPh4)2[ReN(CN)4Him] (2) and (PPh4)2[ReN(CN)4Mim] (3), were synthesized by the reactions of (PPh4)2[ReN(CN)4] (1) with excess five-membered
N-heterocyclic ligands in water. The reaction of 1 with
an excess amount of pyz in CH2Cl2 gave (PPh4)2[ReN(CN)4pyz] (4) in
a high yield. The similar reaction of 1 with an excess
amount of Him or Mim in CH2Cl2 produced the
six-coordinate complex coordinated with the Him or Mim ligand which
occupies at the axial site of the nitridorhenium(V) complex. In (PPh4)2[ReN(CN)4Him]·Him (5) or (PPh4)2[ReN(CN)4Mim]·Mim
(6), furthermore, additional one mole ratio of noncoordinate
Him or Mim was included. In the infrared (IR) spectra, the absorption
bands ascribed to the N-heterocyclic ligands were observed in addition
to those of the (PPh4)+ and [ReN(CN)4]2– units, as shown in the Supporting Information, Figure S1. The 1H NMR spectra
of the new complexes dissolved in CD3CN showed the signals
of N-heterocyclic ligands and (PPh4)+. Each
integral signal intensity ratio of the N-heterocycle to (PPh4)+ was 1:2 for 2, 3, or 4 and 1:1 for 5 or 6. These ratios
were in good agreement with the results of the single-crystal X-ray
analyses of the complexes. In 5 and 6, one
set of the 1H NMR signals of Him and Mim was only observed,
suggesting that the dissociation of Him and Mim ligands from the rhenium
ion rapidly occurred in the solutions as the result of strong trans
effect of the nitrido. The single-crystal X-ray structures of the
new complexes were determined. The crystal structures of the complex
anions of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are displayed in Figure 2. The crystallographic data of the new complexes
are shown in Table S1. The structures and
selected bond distances/angles of the new complexes are summarized
in Table 1. Each complex
anion has a distorted octahedral structure with one nitrido atom being
located at the axial site and an N-heteroaromatic ligand being occupied
at the trans site to the nitrido. The four cyanido ions coordinate
at the equatorial positions with the Re–C bond distances of
2.094(3)–2.128(6) Å and the N(nitrido)≡Re–C
angles of 96.41(10)–101.32(19)°. The bond distance of
Re≡N(nitrido) is in the range of 1.659(4)–1.671(4) Å.
The Re–C and Re≡N(nitrido) bond distances are similar
to those of the previously reported tetracyanidonitridorhenium(V)
complexes.49,58−61 The N(nitrido)≡Re–N(aromatic)
angles are almost linear [175.82(9)–178.48(14)°]. The
Re–N(aromatic) bond distances are in the range 2.410(4)–2.496(2)
Å, which is significantly long because of the trans influence
of the nitrido ligand, while the distances are small compared to those
in [ReN(CN)4L]2– (L = six-membered N-heterocyclic
ligand) [2.45(1)–2.589(5) Å].58 This difference may be due to the steric hindrance because the five-membered
aromatic ring is sterically less hindered than the six-membered ring.
The complex anions in 2 and 5 and the anions
in 3 and 6 have very similar geometries,
respectively. In 5, a noncoordinating Him is involved
per complex anion and the N–H···N hydrogen bond
is formed between the nitrogen atoms in the coordinate Him and that
in the noncoordinate Him [N7···N8, 2.804(6) Å].
The noncoordinate Him interacts with the [ReN(CN)4]2– unit through the N–H···N hydrogen
bond to the nitrogen atom of the cyanido [N3···N9,
2.993(7) Å] and the C–H···N bond to the
nitrido atom [N1···C9, 3.264(8) Å] and to the
cyanido [N5···C10, 3.438(8) Å]. In addition, the
C–H···N interaction is shown between the nitrido
atom and a phenyl ring of PPh4+ [N1···C26,
3.369(8) Å]. In 6, a noncoordinating Mim is included
per complex anion, while there is no hydrogen bonding interaction
between the coordinate and noncoordinate Mim molecules. The noncoordinate
Mim interacts with the nitrido atom of the complex unit by the C–H···N
bond [N1···C12, 3.271(6) Å] and with the cyanide
ligand by the C–H···N bond [N5···C10,
3.344(5) Å, N3···C9, 3.384(6) Å]. The C–H···N
interactions are formed between the nitrido atom and phenyl rings
of PPh4+ ions [N1···C22, 3.316(5)
Å; N1···C46, 3.494(5) Å]. In 2 and 3, the weak interactions show as the O–H···N
hydrogen bonds among water molecules and the nitrogen atoms of the
cyanido ligands [O1···N3, 2.973(5) Å; O2···N3,
2.958(4) Å; O3···N4, 2.853(4) Å for 2 and O1···N4, 2.864(8) Å; O2···N3,
2.930(6) Å; O3···N3, 2.89(1) Å for 3] and as the N–H···N bond between the
coordinate imidazole and the cyanido [N5···N7, 2.854(4)
Å] for 2. Furthermore, the interaction is formed
between the nitrido and a carbon atom of a PPh4+ ion [N1···C46, 3.276(5) Å for 2 and N1···C43, 3.39(1) Å for 3].
In 4, the weak interactions show as the N–H···N
and C–H···N bonds between the pyrazole and cyanido
[N5···N7, 2.955(4) Å and N5···C7,
3.133(4) Å] and C–H···N bonds between the
pyrazole and CH3CN [C6···N8, 3.268(4) Å].
Moreover, the interactions are formed between the nitrido and carbon
atoms of PPh4+ ions [N1···C18,
3.385(4) Å and N1···C35, 3.599(3) Å].

Spectroscopic and Photophysical Properties
UV–vis
diffuse reflectance spectra of the new complexes were measured in
the solid states. Figure S2 in the Supporting Information exhibits the spectra. The complexes show the bands
at 405–418 nm. The peak maximum wavelengths are similar to
those observed for the six-coordinate tetracyanidonitridorhenium(V)
complexes, [ReN(CN)4L]2– (L = pyridine,
MeOH, and acetone).49,58 The band can be ascribed to the
transition (dxy)2 →
(dxy)1(dπ*)1 (dπ* = dxz, dyz) with pπ(N3–)–dπ overlap.49−58 This electronic transition between the highest energy occupied molecular
orbital and lowest energy unoccupied molecular orbital is well characterized
in d2 nitridorhenium(V) complexes.49−58 The spectroscopic and photophysical data of the complexes in the
crystalline phase are shown in Table 2. The emission spectra in the crystalline phase at
296 K are shown in Figures 3 and 4. The complexes, 2, 3, 4, and 6, are highly
photoemissive with the Φem values being 0.65–0.75.
The τem values (52–55 μs) of these complexes
indicate that the emissive excited state is a spin triplet state.
Emission spectra at low temperature were measured to investigate further
the excited state characters of the complexes. Figures 5 and 6 show the emission
spectra of the complexes at 80 K in the crystalline phase. All of
the complexes show vibronic progressions with ca. 1000 cm–1, whose value corresponds to the νRe≡N stretching
band frequencies. The emission spectra are typical for the luminescence
of a nitridorhenium(V) complex.49−58 From these results, we assigned the emissive excited state of 2, 3, 4, and 6 to 3[(dxy)1(dxz or dyz)1] with the pπ(N3–)–dπ overlap. The temperature (T) dependences
of the emission spectrum and the τem value of 2 in the crystalline phase were studied in the T range, 80 < T < 296 K as the data were shown
in Figure S3 and Table S2 in the Supporting Information. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of
the T-dependent emission spectrum and τem of a nitridorhenium(V) complex. As seen in Figure S3, 2 shows the clear vibronic progressions
upon cooling, while the emission maximum wavelength is almost insensitive
to T. The complex, 2, exhibits single
exponential emission decay irrespective of T and
the τem value increased with decreasing T in 120 < T < 296 K, while it was almost constant
at 118–122 μs below 120 K. The rate constant (k) of 2 evaluated as k = 1/τem is 1.86 × 104 s–1 at 296
K and 8.2 × 103 s–1 at 80 K, respectively.
It is known that the k value of [Ru(2,2′-bipyridine)3]2+ in MeOH/EtOH at room temperature decreases
significantly with decreasing T from 8.7 × 105 s–1 at 296 K to 1.8–2.0 × 105 s–1 at 77 K because thermal deactivation
of the emissive excited state of the complex through the upper-energy-lying
metal-centered excited state is suppressed at lower temperature.62 The small variation of the k value with T and the high Φem value
of 2 will be due to almost no contribution of thermal
activation to the nonradiative metal-centered state to excited state
decay of 2. Figure 3 also shows the emission spectrum of 5 in the crystalline phase and the relevant spectroscopic/photophysical
data are included in Table 2. Although the coordination geometries of 2 and 5 are very similar with each other, the large differences
in the λem, τem, and Φem values were observed between those of 2 (λem = 535 nm, τem = 54 μs, Φem = 0.75) and 5 (λem = 561 nm,
weighted average τem = 0.070 μs, Φem < 0.01). In particular, the Φem value
of 5 is significantly smaller than those of 2 and the other new complexes. The spectral feature showing vibronic
progressions of 5 is very similar to 2 at
80 K. Therefore, the emissive excited state of 5 is assignable
to 3[(dxy)1(dxz or dyz)1] with the pπ(N3–)–dπ overlap, and the weak luminescence of 5 is the result of quenching of the emissive excited state of the
complex. In the Mim coordinate complexes, both 3 and 6 showed almost comparable spectroscopic and photophysical
properties: λem = 536 nm, τem =
55 μs, and Φem = 0.65 for 3 and
λem = 537 nm, τem = 52 μs,
and Φem = 0.65 for 6. The Φem and τem data observed for 2 and 5 are, thus, in sharp contrast to those of 3 and 6. As described in the part of X-ray crystallography,
the hydrogen bonding interactions present between the coordinate and
free imidazole molecules and between the nitrido and free imidazole
participate in 5, although the coordination geometry
around the rhenium atoms in 5 is similar to that in 2. The C–H···N bonds at the nitrido
with PPh4+ and Mim, and the O–H···N
hydrogen bonding interactions at the nitrogen atom(s) of the cyanido
with solvent molecules are less effective to the emission quenching
because these interactions exist in the crystals of strongly luminescent 2, 3, and 6. For investigation on
influence of the N–H···N interaction between
coordinate and noncoordinate Him molecules, the tetracyanidonitridorhenium(V)
complexes with imidazole-d5

(Dim) molecule(s), 2-Dim and 5-Dim, were
prepared by the similar reactions to the synthetic procedures to 2 and 5 except for using Dim and deuterated solvents:
D2O for 2-Dim and CD2Cl2/diethylether-d10 for 5-Dim, respectively.
The emission spectral and photophysical data of 2-Dim and 5-Dim in crystalline phase are also listed in Table 2. The λem and τem values of 2-Dim at
both 296 and 80 K are similar to those of 2, as shown
in Supporting Information, Figures S4 and
S5. These results indicate that the deuterated ligand gives almost
no influence to the excited state character and luminescence properties
of 2. In 5-Dim and 5, the emission
spectra and the λem values are similar to each other,
while the τem values of 5 and 5-Dim in the crystalline phase are different at both 296 and
80 K. The weighted average value of τem for 5-Dim (0.16 μs) are longer than that for 5 (0.070 μs) at 296 K. The results suggest that the deuterated
ligand in 5-Dim is hardly contribute to the radiative
process while that influences significantly nonradiative decay of
the excited states of 5 and 5-Dim. Therefore,
the weak luminescence from 5 is attributed to excited-state
deactivation by vibronic relaxation through the N–H···N
hydrogen interactions. The longer emission lifetime of 5-Dim compared to that of 5 would be due to suppression of
excited-state quenching by the slow vibration of the N–D···N
hydrogen bond compared to that of the N–H···N
hydrogen bond. As the noncoordinate Him interacts with the nitrido
by the C–H···N bond, the bond may be also involved
in the luminescence quenching in 5.

Luminescence
Intensity Change by Solvent-Free Reactions and
Exposure of Water
Scheme 1 summarizes the reactions with luminescence intensity
change by coordination/dissociation of the Re–N(aromatic) coordination
bond and the formation/dissociation of the N–H···N
hydrogen bond on the basis of solvent-free reactions and exposure
of water. The solid mixture of 2 and 1 mol equiv of Him
was mechanically ground on an alumina mortar at room temperature.
The bright yellow-green luminescence of 2 gradually disappeared
to give 5. Complex 5 was also afforded by
the mechanochemical reaction of 1 with 2 mol equiv of
Him at room temperature. Figure 7 shows the luminescence intensity change during the
mechanochemical reaction of the solid sample of 1 with
2 mol equiv of Him. The IR spectra and powder X-ray diffraction patterns
of the obtained solids by these reactions are identical with that
of 5 as shown in Supporting Information, Figures S1 and S6.

Figure 7 Luminescence intensity change during the mechanochemical
reaction
of 1 with Him in a 1:2 mole ratio in the solid state
at room temperature. (a) Before the reaction, (b) after 1 min, (c)
after 3 min, (d) after 8 min, (e) after 15 min. The pictures were
taken under UV irradiation.

Scheme 1 Interconversions among 1, 2, and 5 by Solvent-Free Reactions and Exposure of Water
The significant luminescence intensity change
induced by the mechanochemical
reaction of 2 with one mole ratio of Him is responsible
for the large Φem difference between 2 and 5. During the solvent-free reaction of 1 to produce 5, bright yellow-green luminescence appeared
upon grinding (the picture in the middle of Figure 7). As the Φem value of five-coordinate 1 is very small, this observation suggests that coordination
of Him at the axial site of 1 gives the six-coordinate
complex [ReN(CN)4Him]2–. By continuing
grinding, a noncoordinating Him molecule is positioned at the site
with the N–H···N hydrogen bond to give the weak
luminescent complex, 5. The mechanochemical reaction
of 1 with 1 mol equiv of Him gave a yellow-green luminescent
solid. The X-ray powder diffraction of the solid indicates the existence
of 2 along with an unidentified substance. The unidentified
complex might be (PPh4)2[ReN(CN)4Him] with a crystal system different from that of 2.
When one drop of water was placed on a crystal of 5 under
UV irradiation, almost the nonluminescent crystal gradually exhibited
yellow-green photoemission as the water spread around the crystal
as shown in Figure 8 and Movie 1 in the Supporting Information.
The emission spectrum of the crystal agrees well with that of 2 in the crystalline phase. After the microcrystalline sample
of 5 being soaked in water for 3.5 h, the IR spectrum
and powder X-ray diffraction pattern of the solid changed to those
of 2 (Figures S1 and S7),
and the signal integrated intensity ratio of Him and (PPh4)+ is 1:2 in the 1H NMR spectrum in CD3CN (Figure S8). These results suggest
that noncoordinating Him is eliminated by soaking the solid in water
and three H2O molecules are incorporated to give 2. When 5 was suspended in 0.7 mL of D2O, ca. 3% of the complex was dissolved during the reaction; the 1H NMR spectrum of this solution was used to obtain the signal
intensity ratio of (PPh4)+ to the DSS internal
reference. Therefore, the conversion of 5 to 2 may proceed through the process of the dissolution of the complex
in water. When the microcrystalline solid of 6 was placed
in a small amount of water and the mixture was allowed to stand for
3.5 h, the IR spectrum and powder X-ray diffraction pattern changed
to those of 3 (Figures S1 and S9). Therefore, elimination of the noncoordinating Mim molecule in 6 proceeds by exposure of water to give 3, although
the intense luminescence remains through the reaction because the
Φem values of 3 and 6 are
similar to each other.

(lower left); the crystal with an added drop of water (upper right)
and the wet crystal under UV irradiation (lower right).

Vacuum elimination of Him from 2 or 5 was performed to achieve interconversion between the five- and six-coordinate
complexes. Figures S10 and S11 exhibit
the thermal gravimetric curve for 2 and 5, respectively. The thermal gravimetric analysis of 2 shows loss of water from 30 to 70 °C and large weight loss
above 170 °C, and that of 5 exhibits weight loss
above 150 °C. When the microcrystalline sample of 2 was subjected to vacuum at 185 °C, photoemission gradually
weakened. After the vacuum elimination reaction for 6 days, no yellow-green
luminescence was visible by naked eyes. In the 1H NMR spectrum,
the signals of Him are not appeared in the obtained complex. The IR
spectrum of the complex agrees to that of 1 as shown
in Figure S1. Therefore, conversion of 2 to 1 was carried out under vacuum at 185 °C.
The complex 1 was also produced from 5 by
vacuum elimination of Him at 185 °C. As shown in Figure S12, the X-ray powder diffraction patterns
of the obtained complexes were not agreed with that of 1 which was prepared from the vacuum elimination reaction of (PPh4)2[ReN(CN)4MeOH]. This would be because
the molecular packing of 1 in the solid depends on the
starting material in the vacuum elimination of the ligand at the axial
site.

Conclusions
The tetracyanidonitridorhenium(V) complexes
with five-membered
N-heteroaromatic ligands were synthesized and their spectroscopic
and photophysical properties were characterized. All of the complexes
in the present study showed high-emission quantum yield, except for
(PPh4)2[ReN(CN)4Him]·Him. The
nature of the emissive excited state was characterized to 3[(dxy)1(dxz or dyz)1] with the
pπ(N3–)–dπ overlap. The temperature dependence of emission lifetimes was measured
at first time in the nitridorhenium(V) complex using(PPh4)2[ReN(CN)4Him]. The bright yellow-green luminescence
intensity change was accomplished by the solid-based reactions of
the complexes involving changes in the coordination number and in
the environment around the complex. The results demonstrated that
the luminescence intensity change was controlled by the formation/dissociation
of the weak bond in the solid state.

X-ray Crystallography
The single-crystal X-ray data
were collected at −103 °C on a Rigaku RAXIS diffractometer
with graphite-monochromated Mo Kα radiation. The crystal structures
were solved by SHELXT version 2014.63 Atomic
coordinates and thermal parameters of nonhydrogen atoms were calculated
by a full-matrix least-squares method using SHELXL version 2017.64 Calculations were performed using CrystalStructure
4.2.4.

Physical Measurements
1H NMR spectra were
recorded on a JEOL ECS 400 MHz spectrometer. All peaks were referred
to the proton signal of Si(CH3)4 at δ
= 0.00. Solid-state reflectance UV–vis spectra were measured
by a JASCO V-550 spectrophotometer equipped with an integration sphere,
and a sample was placed between two silica glass plates. IR spectra
were recorded on a JASCO FTIR-4100. X-ray powder diffraction patterns
were collected on a RIGAKU Rint 2000 diffractometer using Cu Kα
radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å) with a scan rate of 1°/min(5
≤ 2θ ≤ 50°). Corrected emission spectra excited
at 400 nm were measured by an absolute emission quantum yield measurement
system (Hamamatsu C9920-02) composed of an integrating sphere, a multichannel
photodetector (Hamamatsu Photonics, PMA-12), and a xenon lamp as an
excitation light source. For emission lifetime measurements, a solid
sample was placed between two nonfluorescent glass plates. A pulsed
Nd3+:YAG laser (Lotis TII Ltd., 355 nm, fwhm ∼6
ns or continuum, 355 nm, fwhm 4–6 ns) was used as an excitation
light source. The emission lifetime was measured by using a streak
camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, C4334) or a photomultiplier tube (Hamamatsu,
R928) monitored by a digital oscilloscope (IWATSU, DS-5532A). A liquid
N2 cryostat (DN1704 optical Dewar and 3120 temperature
controller, Oxford Instruments) was used to control the sample temperature.
The pictures of luminescence were taken under irradiation of UV light
at 365 nm using a UV lamp (Vilber, VL-6.LC).
