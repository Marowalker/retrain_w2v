Regio- and enantioselective direct
arylation of β-alkenyl
pyrroline is reported. A wide range of electron-rich arenes and heteroarenes
reacted under mild conditions with different β-alkenyl pyrrolines
to provide structurally diverse α-aryl-β-alkenyl pyrrolidines
with very good yields and excellent regioselectivity. Enantioselective
reaction in the presence of Lewis acids and chiral phosphoric acids
provided the desired arylated product with 73% enantiomeric excess.

Introduction
Functionalized N-heterocycles
with α-aryl and heteroaryl
moieties are present as a core structure of many biologically active
molecules and natural products.1 Therefore,
different synthetic strategies have been developed for the synthesis
of functionalized N-heterocycles.2,3 Synthesis of
functionalized N-heterocycles via direct functionalization of the
N-heterocycles is advantageous as compared to the multistep N-cycloalkylation
strategies (Scheme 1, eq 1). Arylation of imines via Mannich or Betti reaction is another
widely used method for the synthesis of α-arylated amines.4 The Mannich or Betti reactions of acyclic imines
are well-studied.5 However, reports on
the α-arylation of cyclic imines via Mannich or Betti reactions
are limited probably because of the possibility of their isomerization
to the corresponding enamine.6,7 Unsubstituted 1-pyrroline
and 1-piperideine which were generated in situ from the corresponding
amines using strong oxidizing agents have been used to produce the
corresponding α-arylated amines (Scheme 1, eq 1).7a,7c The nucleophilic
addition reaction of α,β-unsaturated pyrroline may proceed
via 1,2- and 1,4-fashion to produce the α-arylated pyrrolidine
derivative and regioisomeric 4-arylated product, respectively. Therefore,
the regioselectivity of the reaction should be controlled in order
to obtain the desired arylated N-heterocycles. Moreover, the probability
of the aromatization-driven redox isomerization of the β-alkenyl
pyrroline to the corresponding pyrrole derivative put further challenges
to find suitable arylation conditions. To the best of our knowledge,
there is no report on the direct regio- and enantioselective arylation
of α,β-unsaturated cyclic imines. Herein, we report the
first example of a regio- and enantioselective α-arylation of
α,β-unsaturated pyrrolines to afford structurally diverse
α-aryl β-alkenyl pyrrolidines with very good yields (Scheme 1, eq 3).

Results and Discussion
Reaction Optimization
We started
our investigation
by reacting unsaturated cyclic imine 1a(8) with β-naphthol 4 in the presence Boc-anhydride
(Boc2O) in dry DCM at room temperature for 24 h.9 The desired α-arylated product 2a was isolated with a moderate yield of 52% (Table 1, entry 1). Interestingly, the regioisomeric
arylated product was not isolated from this reaction. The structure
of 2a was confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis.
Encouraged by the initial result, a number of reactions were performed
by varying the solvent, reaction time, and so forth to further increase
the yield of the desired product. A similar yield was obtained when
the reaction was carried out in toluene. The reactions, which were
carried out at elevated temperature for a shorter time under refluxing
toluene, were able to provide an increased yield of the desired product.
However, a further increase in the reaction time (entry 4) and reaction
temperature (entry 10) did not improve the yield of the desired product.
Although the reactions, which were carried out in other solvents,
such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), CH3CN, and DCE provided
the desired products, toluene was found to be the most suited solvent
for this reaction (entry 5–9).

Substrate Scope
Next, the substrate scope of the reaction
was investigated using the optimized conditions. At first, naphthol
derivatives having different substituents were tested as potential
nucleophiles for the arylation of α,β-unsaturated imine 1a (Scheme 2). 6-Bromo 2-naphthol, 7-bromo 2-naphthol, and 7-methoxy 2-naphthol
reacted smoothly with 1a to produce the desired arylated
product 2b–d with very good yields. Additionally,
1-naphthols also gave α-arylated product 2e with
good yield (66%). Other than naphthol derivatives, sesamol also participated
in the reaction to give the desired product 2f with good
yield (60%). α-Indolyl-N-heterocycles, which are present as
the key motif of many natural products and bioactive molecules, are
an important class of compounds. Therefore, we decided to investigate
the arylation reactions using different indole derivatives as potential
nucleophiles. Accordingly, the indole derivatives containing OMe
and Br substituents were reacted with  unsaturated imine 1a to provide the desired arylated pyrrolidine derivatives 2i–k with good yields. It was observed that the reactions
with indole derivatives needed longer time in comparison to the reactions
with naphthol derivatives to form respective arylated products. 2-Methyl
indole also participated in the reaction as a potent nucleophile to
produce the corresponding arylated product 2h with good
yield (57%).

Scheme 2 Arylation and Heteroarylation of 1a
Then, we have investigated
the scope of this arylation reaction
using structurally diverse imine derivatives. Cyclic imines 1b–k bearing both electron-withdrawing groups and electron-donating
groups in the aryl moiety participated in the reaction to produce
structurally diverse α-aryl β-alkenyl pyrrolidines 2l–vwith good to very good yields (Scheme 3). Substrates with −Cl
and −Br at the para- or meta-position of the phenyl ring reacted
smoothly with 2-naphthols to provide the corresponding α-arylated
product 2l, 2n–o with very good yields (75–66%).
A slightly lower yield of the desired product 2m (60%)
was obtained from the reaction of imines containing the −NO2 group at the meta-position of the phenyl group. Similarly,
cyclic imines 1f–h bearing electron-donating groups
(R = −CH3, −OMe) at the para- and meta-positions
on the phenyl moiety gave the desired α-arylated product 2p–s with good yield (60–71%). Moreover, cyclic
imine 1 containing other aromatic and heteroaromatic
groups, such as naphthyl and a thienyl ring, also took part in this
α-arylation reaction to furnish the desired α-arylated
product 2t–u with very good yields (75–83%).
Reactions using furan and thiophene did not provide the desired product
under these conditions. However, the reaction of imines with pyrrole
gave the desired arylated product 2v with 59% yield.

Scheme 3 Scope of the Arylation Reactions with Imines 1b–k
Proposed Mechanism
Mechanistically, the arylation reaction
is proposed to proceed via the iminium ion 5, which was
formed from the reaction of imine 1 and Boc-anhydride
(eq 4). The aromatic
electrophilic substitution reaction involving iminium ion 5 and electron-rich aromatic compounds occurred readily to provide
the observed arylated products 2. In addition to the
formation of iminium ion 5, the reaction of 1 and Boc-anhydride produced one equivalent of the tert-butoxide ion. The tert-butoxide ion could abstract
the most acidic proton of arenes (OH and NH) to generate anionic arene
species. The close association of this anionic arene species with
iminium ion 5 probably facilitates the formation of the
1,2-adduct. 4  

Studies on the Asymmetric
Arylation Reaction
We anticipated
that the imine can be activated using Lewis acid with a chiral ligand
or chiral Bronsted acid to induce asymmetry in the arylation reactions.
To test this hypothesis, a reaction of imine 1a with
2-naphthol 4 was carried out in the presence of BINOL-derived
chiral phosphoric acid L1 (Table 2).10 The desired
product 3a was isolated with 12% yield. The enantiopurity
of Boc-protected amine 6a was found to be 27%. The reaction
in the presence of amide L4 failed to provide the desired
product. Therefore, we decided to employ Lewis acid in a combination
of a chiral ligand for this enantioselective arylation reaction. The
enantiopurity of the product was improved significantly (from 27 to
43% ee) on the addition of 10 mol % of Sc(OTf)3 in the
reaction of 1a and 4 in the presence of
phosphoric acid L1. The decrease in the reaction temperature
did not provide the desired product. Several other conditions varying
Lewis acids, solvents, reaction times, and so forth were screened
to increase the yield and enantiopurity of the product. However, the
best result (66% yield with 73% ee) was obtained from the reaction
carried out using chiral ligand L1 (23 mol %) and Yb(OTf)3 (20 mol %) as the Lewis acid. Unfortunately, attempted reactions
with other substituted 2-naphthol derivatives or indole or other substituted
cyclic imines gave the desired α-arylated product (e.g. 3b) with very poor or no enantioselectivity.

Conclusions
In
summary, regioselective 1,2-addition reactions of unsaturated
endocyclic imines to the corresponding β-alkenyl 2-aryl pyrrolidines
were developed. The reaction is operationally simple, mild, and highly
atom economic. A wide range of electron-rich aromatic compounds, such
as naphthols, phenols, and indoles, participated in the reaction to
provide the α-arylated products with good to excellent yields.
The studies on the enantioselective version of this arylation reaction
were conducted using catalytic amounts of Lewis acids and chiral phosphoric
acids. A maximum enantiopurity of 73% was achieved for an arylated
derivative.

General Procedure for the Enantioselective Synthesis of 3 (GP II)
To a solution of α,β-unsaturated
cyclic imine 1 (1 equiv) in 2 mL of toluene, chiral phosphoric
acid L1 (23 mol %) and Yb(OTf)3 (20 mol %)
were added at room temperature, and after 10 min, a naphthol derivative
(1 equiv) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature
for 48–72 h. After completion of reaction, the reaction was
quenched by addition of NaHCO3 solution (20 mL) and the
reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 20 mL).
The combined organic layers were washed with water, dried over Na2SO4, and concentrated under reduced pressure to
afford a gummy brown crude product. The crude product was purified
by preparative TLC to afford the analytically pure product.
