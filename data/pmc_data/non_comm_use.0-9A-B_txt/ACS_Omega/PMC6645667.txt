A blue fluorescent p-dimesitylboryl-phenyl-functionalized
1,3-bisbenzimidazolyl benzene molecule (1) has been synthesized
in high yield by Stille coupling of bisbenzimidazolyl bromobenzene
with p-BMes2-SnBu3-benzene.
Methylation of 1 led to the formation of the bisbenzimidazolium
salt (2). The utility of both 1 and 2 in sensing CN– and halide (F–, Cl–, Br–, and I–) was examined, and it was found that only the small fluoride and
cyanide anions were able to bind to the boron atom with binding constants
in the range of 2.9 × 104 to 5 × 105 M–1. Computational studies provided insight into
the photophysical properties of the molecules and verified that a
charge-transfer process is quenched in these “turn-off”
molecular sensors.

Introduction
Molecular-based sensing
of small anions has emerged as an important
avenue of research.1−5 An ideal sensor is one that is selective, stable, water-soluble,
and responsive.5 There has been a particular
emphasis on triarylboranes for the recognition of small anions, such
as fluoride and cyanide.4−6 This is in part due to their inherent
Lewis acidity and tunability (electronically and sterically).4,5 The electron-deficient boron center is an ideal candidate as a recognition
site because the empty p-orbital is available for the anion to donate
an electron pair into. This not only satisfies the saturation of boron
but also imposes a pyramidilization, which can lead to observable
photophysical changes.4 Gabbaï et
al. have developed a series of borane pnictoniums that have large
fluoride-binding constants and are capable of sequestering fluoride
from aqueous media (Chart 1a).7−12 The peripheral cationic functionalities are attractive because they
can help increase the solubility in protic solvents and aid in cooperative
binding of fluoride or provide secondary binding sites.4

Cationic imidazoliums have proven
to be viable molecular sensors
for anion recognition on their own and to have enhanced capabilities
when paired with a boron moiety (Chart 1b).13−18 The anions can have a strong electrostatic interaction with the
acidic proton on the central carbon and participate in a (C–H)+···X– type ionic hydrogen
bond, which leads to changes in the photophysical property.17,18

Pincer ligands are traditionally used as tridentate ligands
for
transition metals and are one of the most widely studied ligands in
organometallic chemistry (Chart 1c).19,20 The metal complexes have many
potential applications such as catalysts,20−22 transmetalating
agents,23−25 and organic light-emitting diodes.26,27 N-Heterocyclic carbene (NHC)-containing pincer ligands have gained
an increasing amount of attention in the literature over the past
decade.19,25,28−30 However, one notable deficiency in this area of chemistry is the
ability to fine-tune the properties by having access to a reactive
site to vary the substituents on the central phenylene or pyridyl
bridge.

In this context, we report the first synthesis of a
triarylboron-functionalized
CCC (carbon-based tridentate ligand) NHC-containing pincer molecule
(1) and its dicationic bisimidazolium derivative (2) via a facile quaternization reaction. The photophysical
properties and the utilities of these two compounds to sense anions
were investigated in comparative studies and are reported herein.

Results
and Discussion
Syntheses and Structures
The CCC
NHC pincer precursor
(L1) was synthesized by an Ullmann reaction following
a modified literature procedure.31 The
crude reaction mixture contains mono-, bis-, and tris-substituted
benzimidazole products, which could be separated by column chromatography.
A Stille reaction was employed to couple L1 and p-BMes2-C6H4-SnBu3 (Scheme 1), and the
crude product was purified by column chromatography. The 1H NMR spectrum of the appropriate combined fractions showed a single
product with resonances corresponding to the −BMes2 substituent and a singlet representing the proton on the central
carbon atom of the imidazole (δH = 8.24 ppm in CD2Cl2). This confirmed the successful synthesis of
the target boron-containing bisbenzimidazole product, 1. X-ray quality single crystals of 1 were grown from
a slowly evaporated dichloromethane solution of the bulk material,
and the solid-state structure (Figure 1a) was determined by X-ray diffraction studies. Compound 1 was subsequently transformed to the bisbenzimidazolium salt
(2-I) via a quaternization reaction with iodomethane
in tetrahydrofuran (THF) at 55 °C for 24 h. A diagnostic downfield
shift of the proton (δH = 11.54 ppm and ΔδH = 3.3 ppm in CD2Cl2) on the central
carbon of the heterocycle32 and the appearance
of a singlet at δH = 4.38 ppm (in CD2Cl2) were indicative of the formation of an imidazolium salt.
High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) also provided corroborating
evidence for the synthesis of 2-I. A nearly quantitative
anion-exchange reaction was performed between 2-I and
2 equiv of TlPF6 to obtain 2-PF6, which contains the less reactive and noncoordinating
PF6– anion. Multinuclear NMR spectroscopy
studies of 2-PF6 revealed that
the 1H NMR spectrum was essentially unchanged, whereas
the 31P{1H} and 19F{1H}
NMR spectra had a septet (δP = 17.2 ppm) and a doublet
(δF = −71.1 ppm), respectively, with a coupling
constant (1JP–F) of
711 Hz for the PF6 anion. An anion-exchange reaction of 2-I with tetrabutylammonium chloride (TBACl) was performed
to obtain 2-Cl as a reference compound. X-ray quality
single crystals of 2-Cl were grown by slow diffusion
of Et2O into a CH2Cl2/MeOH solution
of the bulk material (Figure 2).

Scheme 1 Synthetic Procedures for the Synthesis of Compounds 1, 2-I, 2-PF6, 2-Cl, and L2
In the crystal lattice, molecule 1 has a
crystallographically
imposed C2 axis. Examination of the crystal
structures indicated that the molecules contain a trigonal planar
boron atom (Σang = 360°) with the aryl rings
about the boron centers having torsion angles of 18.28(10)°,
25.8(5)–27.5(5)° for the phenyl rings, and 57.22(15)°
and 53.2(5)–55.4(5)° for the mesityl rings of 1 and 2-Cl, respectively. The phenyl ring of PhBMes2 and the benzimidazole rings were twisted 26.20(10)°
and 36.5(2)° for 1 and 42.2(5)° and 44.0(4)–56.8(4)°
for 2-Cl out of plane from the main phenyl ring, respectively.
Interestingly, in the crystal structures of 1 and 2-Cl, the benzimidazole rings adopt different orientations.
In 1, the benzimidazolyl C(1) atoms and the phenyl C(8)
atoms are oriented toward each other, whereas in 2-Cl, they are away from each other. This can be attributed to the H
bonds between the chloride ions and the H atoms on the imidazolyl
rings, as evidenced by the short contact distances of Cl(1)···H(1),
2.39 Å and Cl(2)···H(9) of 2.42 Å, which
are less than the sum of the van der Waals radii (ΣvdW(Cl–H) = 3.0 Å).33 In the crystal lattice
of 1, the benzimidazolyl rings form antiparallel stacked
pairs, with interplane distances of 3.64(1) and 3.65(1) Å, as
shown in Figure 3,
providing the extended one-dimensional arrangement of molecule 1. In the crystal lattice of 2-Cl, there are
multiple H bonds between the chlorine anion and the dication. Furthermore,
the chloride ion has multiple short contact distances with a benzimidazolyl
ring, as shown in Figure 4. In fact, the chloride ions are enveloped by two neighboring
dications because of their attractive electrostatic interactions.

bonds and the short contact distances involving

Small Anions Sensing
Compounds 1, 2-I, and 2-PF6 are weakly
blue fluorescent with emission quantum efficiencies of 0.07, 0.01,
and 0.05, respectively, determined in CH2Cl2, relative to 9,10-diphenylanthracene. The utilities of these compounds
in anion sensing were examined. Titration experiments with various
anions (F–, Cl–, Br–, I–, and CN–) were conducted
on 1 and 2-PF6.
In addition, the binding events were monitored by NMR, absorption,
and emission studies. In the case of 1, it was discovered
by NMR spectroscopy experiments that Cl–, Br–, and I– anions had minimal interactions
with the molecule (Figure S1) but NMR spectroscopy
indicated that fluoride and cyanide bind to the boron atom in a 1:1
fashion. Upon the addition of tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) or
tetraethylammonium cyanide (TEACN), upfield shifts were observed for
the aryl and methyl protons of the Mes group in the 1H
NMR spectrum (Figure 5), as well as in the 11B NMR spectrum that displays a
distinct four-coordinate 11B signal after the addition
of fluoride or cyanide ions (Figure S2),
indicative of the binding of the anion to the boron center. The 19F NMR spectrum showed two peaks at δF =
−172.9 and −126.7 (Figure S3), which correspond to bound and free fluoride ions,34 respectively, in the case of TBAF addition, which gave
further evidence that the anion was binding to boron. The fluoride
anion can be removed from the boron atom by extraction with water,
as evidenced by the mesityl peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum
shifting back downfield to the original chemical shifts of 1 (Figure S4).34,35

Figure 5 1H NMR spectroscopy stacked plot of 1 (bottom), 1 with 1 equiv of TBAF (middle), and 1 with 1
equiv of TEACN (top) in CD2Cl2.

Titrations of 2-PF6 with tetrabutylammonium
iodide, bromide, and chloride were studied by 1H and 11B NMR spectroscopy. The addition of the halide salt caused
a downfield shift of the peaks corresponding to the proton on the
central carbon of the imidazolium and the proton between the two imidazolium
moieties on the phenyl ring (Figures S5–S8). However, when the halide solution was washed with water, the peaks
shifted back upfield (Figure S9). No change
was observed in the 11B NMR spectra or for the protons
corresponding to the Mes groups in the 1H NMR spectra,
indicating that there is no interaction between the larger halides
and the Lewis acidic boron. The observed shift in the 1H NMR spectra with larger halides can be therefore attributed to
H bond interactions between the halide and the protons of the imidazolyl
and the phenyl in the dication 2, consistent with the
crystal structure of 2-Cl. NMR spectra showed a complex
change when 2-PF6 was titrated
with TBAF (Figure S11), which is consistent
with the binding/interaction of the fluoride ions with both the boron
center and the protons of the imidazolyl and the phenyl rings.

Fluoride and cyanide anion sensing were also monitored by absorption
and fluorescence spectroscopy, respectively (Figure 6). The addition of TBAF or TEACN to 1 resulted in the fluorescence being quenched or partially
quenched, respectively, making this molecule a “turn-off”
sensor. The emission at approximately 420 nm was fully quenched after
15 equiv of TBAF (I/I0 = 0.04) and partially quenched after 10 equiv of TEACN (I/I0 = 0.57). Even though the
emission of compound 1 shows high sensitivity to fluoride,
the low fluorescence quantum yield may limit its practical applications.3e In the absorption spectrum, the peak at 320
nm was suppressed and the peaks at 280 and 255 nm increased in intensity.
The absorption and fluorescence spectral change of 1 with
TBAF/TEACN can be attributed to primarily the binding of the anion
with the boron center. The binding constant was calculated from the
experimental data and found to be in the range of 6.3 × 104 to 8.3 × 104 M–1 for the
fluoride anion and 4.6 × 104 to 2.7 × 105 M–1 for the cyanide anion, which is comparable
with other systems.6 We were unable to
find a perfect model to fit all of the experimental data but have
an approximate range based on calculating the binding constants at
various wavelengths in the absorption and fluorescence spectra using
an acceptable model (see Supporting Information for more details).

and (b) TEACN (0–10 equiv).

Titration experiments for 2-PF6 with small anions (F– and CN–) were conducted and monitored via absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy.
The charged species was also found to be a “turn-off”
sensor, and the emission spectrum with a maximum at λ = 438
nm was fully quenched after 4 and 10 equiv of TBAF and TEACN were
added, respectively (Figure 7). In the emission spectrum, with the TBAF/TEACN titration
(Figure 7a), a new
peak at λmax = ∼380 nm was observed after
the original fluorescence at λmax = 438 nm was quenched
(I/I0 = 0.06 for TBAF
and I/I0 = 0.02 for TEACN).
The emission quenching and the blue-shifted peak can be attributed
to both anion binding with the boron center and their interactions
with the imidazolium, resulting in a (C–H)+···F–-type ionic hydrogen bond.13 Gabbaï et al. have demonstrated that cationic boranes show
higher fluoride-binding strength compared with the neutral species
because of both Columbic and cooperative effects.8,10 However,
in our case, the binding constants for fluoride (2.9 × 104 to 5 × 105 M–1) and cyanide
anions (7.5 × 104 to 3.3 × 105 M–1) are approximately the same in the case of the dication,
compared to the neutral molecule. Therefore, the additional peripheral
cationic substituents in this particular pincer-type architecture
do not have a great impact on the binding affinity of molecules to
small anions. This may be attributed to the remoteness of the positively
charged sites from the boron center.

Computational Studies
Computational methods (see Supporting Information) were employed using density
functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) to study 1 and 1-F–, respectively
(with fluoride bound to boron). The calculated frontier orbitals of
the molecules are depicted in Figure 8. The DFT calculations indicated that the highest occupied
molecular orbital (HOMO) is localized on the benzimidazolyl-phenyl
unit for 1 and one Mes unit for 1-F–. According to TD-DFT results, the S0 → S1 vertical excitation for compound 1 is a charge transfer (CT) from the mesityl substituents
(HOMO – 1) to the empty pπ-orbital on boron
[lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO)], whereas that for 1-F– is also a CT from a Mes
(HOMO) to the phenyl ring that connects two benzimidazolyl units (see Figures S22 and S23; S30 and S33). Significantly,
the oscillator strength of the S0 → S1 vertical excitation decreases substantially from 1 (0.0635)
to 1-F– (0.0468), which
is likely responsible for the fluorescence quenching of 1 by fluoride ions. DFT and TD-DFT calculations were also accomplished
for compound 2-Cl and its fluoride adduct (2-ClF–). Similar to the neutral species 1, the HOMO is located on the methylated benzimidazolyl units
and the LUMO is located on boron for 2-Cl. TD-DFT calculations
revealed that the first three vertical excitations for 2-Cl involve HOMO/HOMO – 1 to LUMO; HOMO – 2, HOMO –
3/HOMO – 4 to LUMO; and HOMO – 5 to LUMO (some of these
transitions are either degenerate or very close in energy). They all
involve the benzimidazolyl-to-boron CT transitions with weak oscillator
strengths. The fourth vertical transition is Mes (HOMO – 6)
to boron CT transition with a moderate oscillator strength (see Figures 8, S34, and S36). The CT of 2-Cl is diminished upon
fluoride coordination to boron, and the absorption spectrum undergoes
a blue shift based on the TD-DFT data.

Conclusions
We have synthesized triarylborane-functionalized
bisbenzimidazole
molecules with a phenylene bridge as a neutral species and with pendant
cationic charges. The ability of these compounds to act as fluorescent
sensors toward small anions was examined, and they were found to bind
fluoride and cyanide anions and respond in a “turn-off”
fashion. This is due to a disruption of the CT process from the mesityl/benzimidazolyl
groups to the empty pπ-orbital on boron upon anion
coordination to boron. Unfortunately, no appreciable difference in
the binding constants was observed between the neutral and charged
species. Future work will be focused on applying the tridentate ligand
to transition metals to create new CCC boron-functionalized pincer
complexes.

g, 1.28 mmol), 1,10-phenanthroline (0.463 g, 2.57 mmol), and K2CO3 (7.12 g, 51.5 mmol) was added dimethylformamide
(40 mL). The suspension was heated at 150 °C for 7 h, was allowed
to stir at rt overnight, and then heated at 150 °C for 8 h under
N2. After cooling to rt, the reaction mixture was diluted
with CH2Cl2 (50 mL) and washed with deionized
H2O (4 × 50 mL). The combined aqueous layers were
further washed with CH2Cl2 (3 × 30 mL).
The combined organic layers were dried over MgSO4 and filtered,
and the filtrate was concentrated by rotary evaporation. The filtrate
was then dried further on a Schlenk line while using a hot water bath.
The sticky wax was redissolved in CH2Cl2, and
Et2O was added with vigorous stirring to give a green precipitate.
The suspension was filtered, and the yellow/orange filtrate was concentrated
by rotary evaporation to give a yellow solid. The crude compound was
then purified by column chromatography (3% MeOH in CH2Cl2) on silica. The monosubstituted product comes off the column
first, followed by the desired bis- and last tris-substituted products.
The yellow bis-substituted product was further purified by washing
in minimal CH2Cl2 (3 × 3 mL) to obtain
a white solid. After washing, the solid was placed in the freezer
overnight, which precipitated the white solid. The combined solids
were dried in vacuo. Yield: 25% (1.24 g, 3.19 mmol). 1H

A THF solution (30 mL) of 1-bromo-4-dimesitylboronphenyl
(1.21 g, 3.00 mmol) was cooled to −78 °C, and n-BuLi (1.6 M, 2.25 mL, 3.60 mmol) was added slowly, resulting
in an orange solution. This was stirred at −78 °C for
1 h. Tributyltin chloride (0.81 mL, 3.00 mmol) was added to the cold
reaction mixture, and the solution became yellow. The reaction was
allowed to warm to rt slowly and stirred overnight. The volatiles
were removed in vacuo, and Et2O was added to give a white
suspension. The white solid was separated by centrifugation, and the
supernatant was decanted and then dried by rotary evaporation to give
a viscous liquid. It was redissolved in Et2O, which gave
a white suspension. A second centrifugation was performed to separate
the white precipitate. The ether solution was decanted and concentrated
by rotary evaporation, then transferred to a vial, and dried further
in vacuo on a Schlenk line. This resulted in a yellow viscous liquid

was added to the reaction mixture. The yellow suspension was refluxed
at 115 °C for 5 days. After 2 days, the suspension turned black.

dried by rotary evaporation to give a solid. The yellow precipitate
from the reaction mixture was washed with CH2Cl2 (3 × 6 mL) and finally with MeOH (6 mL). After washing, the
precipitate was added to the collected solid and dried by rotary evaporation,
resulting in an off-white solid. Yield: 87% (0.25 g, 0.26 mmol). 1H (400 MHz, DMSO-d6): 10.37 (s,

Compound 2-Cl was obtained by
anion exchange of 2-I with TBACl hydrate.

Compound L2
Compound L1 (0.530
g, 1.36 mmol) was suspended in toluene (8 mL) in a pressure tube.
1-Iodobutane (1 mL, 8.79 mmol) was added, and the sealed vessel was
heated at 150 °C overnight. The yellow solution was decanted,
and the light yellow solid was dried in vacuo. The yellow solid was
washed with CH2Cl2 (2 × 6 mL) and centrifuged
to separate the white solid. The yellow supernatant was transferred
to a vial and placed in the freezer (−23 °C) overnight.
A white solid precipitated from the solution was separated by centrifugation
and was added to the previously isolated white solid. The combined
solids were dried in vacuo. Yield: 75% (0.774 g, 1.02 mmol). 1H (300 MHz, DMSO-d6): 10.35 (s,
2H, NCHN), 8.50 (s, 2H, aryl), 8.48 (s, 1H, aryl),

Computational Studies
The computational
calculations
were performed using Gaussian 09, revision B.0137 software package,
and the High Performance Computing Virtual Laboratory at Queen’s
University. The ground-state geometries were fully optimized at B3LYP38,39 exchange–correlation functional using the 6-31G(d) basis
set.40 The initial geometric parameters
of 1 and 2-Cl in the calculations were employed
from the crystal structure data for geometry optimization. TD-DFT
calculations were performed to obtain the vertical singlet excitation
energies.

X-ray Diffraction Analysis
Single-crystal X-ray diffraction
data were collected on a Bruker Apex II-CCD detector using Mo Kα
radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) and at a temperature of 180(2)
K. Structures were solved and refined using SHELXTL. The crystal data
of 1 and 2-Cl were deposited in Cambridge
Crystallographic Data Centre [CCDC nos. 1581568 (1),
1581569 (2-Cl)]. These data can be obtained free of charge
from The Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre via www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/data_request/cif.
