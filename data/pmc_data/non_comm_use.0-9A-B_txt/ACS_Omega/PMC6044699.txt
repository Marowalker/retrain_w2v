The success of hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation depends
in part on the number and the quality of cells transplanted. Cryoinjuries
during freezing and thawing reduce the ability of hematopoietic stem
and progenitor cells (HSPCs) to proliferate and differentiate after
thawing. Up to 20% of the patients undergoing umbilical cord blood
(UCB) transplant experience delayed or failed engraftment, likely
because of the inadequate hematopoietic potency of the unit. Therefore,
the optimization of cryopreservation protocols, with an emphasis on
the preservation of HSPCs, is an important issue. Current protocols
typically utilize a 10% dimethyl sulfoxide cryoprotectant solution.
This solution ensures 70–80% post-thaw cell viability by diluting
intracellular solutes and maintaining the cell volume during cryopreservation.
However, this solution fails to fully protect HSPCs, resulting in
the loss of potency. Therefore, a new class of cryoprotectants (N-aryl-d-aldonamides) was designed and assessed
for the ability to inhibit ice recrystallization and to protect HSPCs
against cryoinjury. Several highly active ice recrystallization inhibitors
were discovered. When used as additives to the conventional cryoprotectant
solution, these nontoxic small molecules improved the preservation
of functionally divergent hematopoietic progenitors in the colony-forming
unit and long-term culture-initiating cell assays. By contrast, structurally
similar compounds that did not inhibit ice recrystallization failed
to improve the post-thaw recovery of myeloid progenitors. Together,
these results demonstrate that the supplementation of cryopreservation
solution with compounds capable of controlling ice recrystallization
increases the post-thaw function and potency of HSPCs in UCB. This
increase may translate into reduced risk of engraftment failure and
allow for greater use of cryopreserved cord blood units.

1 Introduction
Transplantation
of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC)
products offers life-saving treatment for patients suffering from
hematological cancers and nonmalignant hematological diseases such
as hemoglobinopathies, immunodeficiency syndromes, and inherited metabolic
disorders.1,2 Moreover, HSPCs are increasingly used for
novel and emerging regenerative therapies, including the treatment
of neurological disorders, cardiac disease, and diabetes.3 In comparison to bone marrow (BM) or mobilized
peripheral blood, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation using umbilical
cord blood (UCB) can be associated with delayed neutrophil and platelet
engraftment due to the limited volume that can be collected and the
resulting reduced dosage of cells.4 However,
UCB offers several advantages such as ready availability, reduced
risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), negligible risk to donor,
and less-stringent human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matching requirements.5,6

Although stem cell grafts from adult donors are collected
and infused
as quickly as possible without cryopreservation, UCB units are processed
and stored at −196 °C for future use.7 Moreover, in the case of autologous hematopoietic transplantation,
patients’ cells are collected, cryopreserved, and reinfused
following the conditioning treatment to rescue hematopoiesis.7 Cryopreservation introduces several issues that
may compromise the success of transplantation. First, HSPCs are cryopreserved
using the cryoprotectant dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).8 The DMSO present in the thawed HSPC product has been shown
to have adverse effects on the gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, central
nervous, cardiovascular, and respiratory systems.7,9−12 In an effort to reduce toxicity, the removal of DMSO before transfusion
has been employed for patients at risk with pre-existing conditions.13−15 However, Yang et al. have demonstrated that removing DMSO through
repeated washing decreases viability and recovery of UCB CD34+ cells.16 The second issue with cryopreservation is that
high levels of apoptotic CD34+ cells (up to 30%) are observed following
cryopreservation, and this is correlated with a reduced ability to
engraft.16−19 Additionally, Sasnoor et al. have found that cryopreservation impairs
growth factor responsiveness, and this is correlated with a reduced
ability to proliferate and differentiate post-thaw.20−22

Recently,
Ben et al. reported that the supplementation of the cryoprotectant
solution with mono- and disaccharides possessing the ability to inhibit
ice recrystallization improved the post-thaw viability of CD34+ cells
from cryopreserved UCB.23 However, the
success of HSPC transplantation is directly correlated with both the
number and the quality of cells transplanted.24−31 A recent study correlated prefreeze and post-thaw cell characteristics
to determine the best indicators for successful engraftment and concluded
that the colony-forming unit (CFU) dose was the best indicator for
successful engraftment.32 Therefore, we
sought to assess the post-thaw clonogenic potential of HSPCs cryopreserved
with small molecules capable of controlling ice growth or recrystallization.
In this report, a new class of novel small molecules, N-aryl-d-aldonamides (Figure 1), was rationally designed and assessed for their ability
to inhibit ice recrystallization. Several very effective ice recrystallization
inhibitors (IRIs) were discovered. When used as additives to the conventional
10% DMSO cryoprotectant solution, these nontoxic small molecules improved
the post-thaw recovery from hematopoietic progenitors from cryopreserved
UCB units.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Ice Recrystallization Inhibition Activity
of N-Aryl-d-aldonamides
A series
of N-aryl-d-aldonamides were synthesized
and assessed for their ability to inhibit ice recrystallization using
the splat-cooling assay (Figure 2). Briefly, compounds were dissolved at 22 mM in phosphate
buffered saline (PBS), except for compound 2, which was
insoluble at 22 mM and assessed at 11 mM. A 10 μL droplet of
this solution was dropped onto a precooled (−80 °C) block
of polished aluminum to form a frozen wafer, which was then held at
−6.4 °C for 30 min. The wafer was then photographed, and
the ice crystal sizes were calculated using ImageJ analysis software
(see Supporting Information for details).
The inhibitory activity is represented as a percentage of mean grain
size (MGS) relative to a PBS positive control for ice recrystallization.
As such, a smaller percentage represents a more highly active molecule
(i.e., smaller ice crystals in the sample).

Figure 2 Structures and IRI activities
of N-aryl-d-aldonamides 1–10. Compounds were
assessed at 22 mM except for compound 2, which was insoluble
at 22 mM and tested at 11 mM. IRI activity is expressed as a percentage
of MGS relative to a PBS positive control for ice recrystallization.
Error bars are reported as the standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical
significance (p < 0.05) was assessed using a one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a Tukey multiple comparison test.
Compounds with similar activities (p > 0.05) are
marked with the same letter above the bars in the graph, and statistical
differences (p < 0.05) are indicated by the use
of different letters above the bars.

Compound 1 was moderately active with a MGS
of 65%
when compared with the PBS control. However, the addition of a fluorine
atom at position 2 on the aromatic ring (compound 2)
resulted in a highly active IRI with a MGS of 3% (Figure 2). Interestingly, a fluorine
substituent in the para-position (3)
abolished much of this activity (MGS of 90%), whereas a chlorine substituent
in the para-position (4) partially restored
the lost IRI activity. Conversely, when this chlorine substituent
was positioned in the ortho-position (5), the compound was inactive. Interestingly, the introduction of
a methoxy functional group in the para-position (6) resulted in a very effective IRI with a MGS of 4%, whereas
substitution with the same functional group in the ortho-position (7) abolished this activity (Figure 2). Compound 8 with
a carbon linker between the aryl ring and the amide bond possessed
an IRI activity of approximately 40%. Compound 9, having
two fluorine substituents in positions 2 and 6 of the aromatic ring,
was a highly IRI active molecule with a MGS of 13%. However, when
the fluorine substituents were in positions 3 and 5 of the aromatic
ring (10), the molecule was inactive (Figure 2). In summary, these results
show that IRI molecules 2 and 6 are the
most potent IRI compounds identified in this directed screen followed
by 4 and 9. Conversely, structurally similar
compounds 3, 5, 7, and 10 were inactive IRIs that were utilized as controls for the
IRI active molecules.

2.2 Impact of IRIs on the Post-thaw
Viability
of UCB CD34+ Cells from Leukocyte Concentrates
In the clinic,
leukocyte concentrates (LCs) (i.e., buffy coat) consisting of total
nucleated cells (TNCs) containing myeloid and lymphoid cells and HSPCs
are isolated from units by red blood cell (RBC) depletion using hydroxyethyl
starch. UCB LCs were extracted from the UCB, and the total number
of viable CD34+ cells was quantified by flow cytometry using the single-platform
ISHAGE method for CD34 cell enumeration. Small-scale cryopreservation
experiments were designed to carefully mimic clinical preservation
protocols (DMSO and dextran in 0.9% saline) to effectively compare
the cryopreservation success of HSPCs that are cryopreserved with
IRI active molecules.8

We hypothesized
that by supplementing this cryoprotectant solution with IRIs, the
concentration of DMSO could be reduced without influencing post-thaw
cell viability. Therefore, the LCs were cryopreserved with final DMSO
concentrations of 0, 2, 5, and 10% DMSO (using a 1:5 dilution with
the LC). These cryoprotectant solutions were also supplemented with
IRI active compounds 2, 4, 6, and 9. The cryoprotectant solution was added to LCs
(50 000 CD34+ cells/mL) and then cooled at a rate of 1 °C/min
to −80 °C before storage in a liquid nitrogen Dewar flask
for 48 h. The samples were then thawed in a 37 °C water bath
and diluted, and the post-thaw viability was assessed by flow cytometry
using 7-AAD. As shown in Figure 3, there is no increase in the CD34+ cell viability
upon supplementation of the 0 and 2% DMSO cryoprotectant solution
with IRIs. In fact, in most instances, there are statistically significant
decreases in the post-thaw viability. When 5% DMSO is used, there
is no difference in the post-thaw viability with the IRIs. The same
results were obtained with 10% DMSO with the exception of a slight
reduction in the viability with 9. These results suggested
a cytotoxic effect by IRIs. However, when the IRI compounds were assessed
for cytotoxicity using the MTT assay (details in Supporting Information), compounds 2, 4, 6, and 9 were found to be less cytotoxic
at the concentrations utilized when compared with 10% DMSO (Figure S1).

LCs cryopreserved in various
concentrations of DMSO and IRI active compounds 2, 4, 6, and 9. Mean ± SEM presented
of 3–7 independent experiments. Viability was assessed by flow
cytometry using the ISHAGE-gating strategy with 7-AAD. Statistical
significance, marked by asterisks, was assessed using ANOVA with a
Dunnett’s test for comparison to the control (no compound)
with a 95% (*) or 99% (**) confidence level.

2.3 Impact of IRIs on the Post-Thaw Viability
of UCB Committed and Multipotent Progenitors
The success
of HSPC transplantation is directly correlated with both the number
and quality of cells transplanted.24−31 The only test capable of identifying the presence of functional
hematopoietic stem cells is the in vivo transplantation assay.33,34 This assay measures the ability of transplanted HSPCs (or LCs) to
reconstitute the entire blood-forming system of an ablated host.33,34 In this assay, hematopoietic reconstitution is measured in the peripheral
blood samples at ≥4 months post-transplantation.33,34 This time-consuming and expensive assay is not ideal for predicting
the engraftment of banked CBUs. Therefore, transplant centers typically
select HLA-matched units based on the TNC count, the number of CD34+
cells, and the number of committed progenitors detected using the
CFU assay in the banked units.32 Importantly,
patients who fail to engraft will often engraft successfully when
another unit is given, indicating that conventional methods of graft
selection are imperfect and do not discriminate units that will be
unlikely to engraft.32 Up to 20% of the
patients receiving a UCB transplant will fail to fully engraft, in
part because of inadequate potency of the unit.35−38

A recent study correlated
prefreeze and post-thaw cell characteristics to determine the best
indicators for successful engraftment and concluded that the CFU (committed
progenitor) dose was the best indicator for successful engraftment.32 Typical post-thaw recoveries of TNCs of a cryopreserved
cord unit were >80%, but the yield of colonies obtained in CFU
assays
after thawing was only 21.2%.32 On the
basis of this measure of graft adequacy, only 2.8% of the inventory
at a large cord blood bank would provide an adequate dose to ensure
timely engraftment for a patient >50 kg.32 To overcome this significant limitation, two or three separate UCB
units are often transplanted in adult recipients to obtain a sufficient
dose.39 This is, however, very costly and
can lead to increased incidence of GVHD. The reduction in post-thaw
CFU yields may reflect the damage to the unit during cryopreservation,
shipping, and thawing. Therefore, the optimization of cryopreservation
protocols for HSPCs, with an emphasis on the preservation of clonogenic
CFU potential, is an important issue for optimizing storage in UCB
banks.

Given that the CFU assay is one of the best indicators
of engraftment
potential,32,40 we sought to determine whether
IRIs could improve the post-thaw recovery of committed progenitors
of cryopreserved LCs. IRIs 2, 4, 6, and 9 were selected because of their high IRI activity
and their low cytotoxicity levels (Figure S1). First, we tested whether the addition of IRIs 2, 4, 6, and 9 at concentrations lower
than those used to assess IRI activity could improve the post-thaw
recovery of committed progenitors. The increase in the number of committed
progenitors in thawed LCs was observed for most committed progenitors,
but the differences versus control (no compound) were not significant
(Figure 4).

Figure 4 Total number
of colonies formed (per 80 μL thawed LC) post-thaw
after cryopreservation of LCs in 10% DMSO supplemented with IRI active
molecules. Mean ± SEM presented of 6–10 independent experiments.
There is no statistical significance (p > 0.05)
as
assessed using ANOVA with a Tukey multiple comparison test.

A concentration scan was performed
to identify the optimal concentration
for each IRI. Remarkably, significant increase (p < 0.001, 0.01, or 0.05) in the number of progenitors in a dose-dependent
manner was obtained when the standard cryoprotectant solution was
supplemented with IRI active molecules (Figure 5). Compound 2 with the highest
IRI activity was most effective at 12.5 and 25 mM (p < 0.05 and 0.01), producing 2-fold increases in the number of
committed progenitor cells when compared with the control. Compound 4 with a moderate IRI activity did not produce significantly
more colonies than the control (p > 0.05). Compound 6 with an IRI activity equivalent to compound 2 produced the most colonies out of the compounds tested at 27.5 mM
(p < 0.05), more than 2.4 times greater than the
10% DMSO cryoprotectant solution. Finally, compound 9 with the third highest IRI activity promoted progenitor recovery
slightly lower than compounds 2 and 6.

Figure 5 Dose response
for the total number of colonies formed (per 80 μL
thawed LC) post-thaw after cryopreservation of LCs with 10% DMSO supplemented
with various concentrations of (A) compound 2, (B) compound 4, (C) compound 6, or (D) compound 9. Mean ± SEM presented of 2–10 independent experiments.
Statistical significance, marked by asterisks, was assessed using
ANOVA with a Dunnett’s test for comparison to the control (no
compound) with a 95% (*), 99% (**), or 99.9% (***) confidence level.

There was no significant increase
in the post-thaw viability of
CD34+ cells when compared with the standard 10% DMSO cryoprotectant
solution in each case (Figure S2). In fact,
the percentages of post-thaw CD34+ cell viability were poorly correlated
with colony formation (R2 = 0.20, data
not shown). These results further suggest that the post-thaw viability
is not an accurate measure of cryopreservation success and UCB potency.
However, although there were no differences in the percentages of
post-thaw CD34+ cell viability, the net recovery of viable CD34+ cells
was significantly greater with IRI 2 at 25 mM with a
1.6-fold increase when compared with the control (p < 0.0001) and IRI 9 at 18 and 55 mM, with a 1.4-fold
increase when compared with the control (p < 0.05
and 0.01, Figure S3).

The number
of CFU-GMs has been reported to be associated with the
transplantation outcome of HSPCs from autologous BM and UCB.40−45 Furthermore, it has been reported that successfully transplanted
UCB units had a higher number of CFU-GMs than those that were not
transplanted.46 LCs supplemented with 6 or 9 resulted in a significant increase (p < 0.0001 and 0.05) in CFU-GEMM formation post-thaw
(Table 1). Furthermore,
IRI 6 increased the post-thaw yield of CFU-GM colonies
(Table 1).

IRIs 2 and 6 were the most effective
inhibitors of ice recrystallization and supported the largest increase
in the number of post-thaw committed progenitors and CD34+ cell numbers,
whereas the least IRI active compound (4) produced a
similar number of progenitors as the DMSO control. To investigate
whether this protective effect correlated with the ability to control
ice growth and recrystallization, LCs were cryopreserved with structurally
similar compounds (3, 5, 7,
and 10) that did not exhibit an IRI activity. As expected,
these compounds had very little effect on the CD34+ post-thaw viability
(Figure S4A) and the total number of colonies
formed in the CFU assay (Figure S4B). These
results suggest that the compounds capable of controlling ice and
recrystallization have a protective effect on the ability of UCB CD34+
cells and committed progenitors to proliferate and differentiate post-thaw.

The increased recovery of CFU indicated that IRIs 2, 6, and 9 improve the post-thaw functional
ability of progenitors. To further investigate this cryoprotective
effect of IRIs on more immature progenitors, we measured the frequency
of multipotent progenitors in UCB LCs supplemented with the most effective
IRIs (2, 6) using the stringent long-term
culture-initiating cell (LTC-IC) assay. This assay measures the frequency
of progenitors with self-renewal and differentiation activities significantly
superior to progenitors detected using the CFU assay.47 The frequency of LTC-IC in supplemented LCs was measured
using limiting dilution analysis (LDA, Figure 6A). The frequencies of LTC-IC were increased
up to 2-fold in post-thaw LCs supplemented with IRIs 2 (25 mM, p < 0.05) and 6 (27.5 mM, p > 0.05, Figure 6B). Moreover, the total number of LTC-ICs recovered was always
greater in the cryopreserved samples containing IRIs (Figure 6C), resulting in a 2.25-fold
increase in LTC-IC yields versus control (Figure 6D).

post-thaw LCs after
cryopreservation with 10% DMSO supplemented with IRIs 2 (25 mM) and 6 (27.5 mM). (A) Overview of LDA used to
measure the frequency of LTC-ICs in LCs. (B) Mean frequency of LTC-ICs

LTC-ICs obtained per thawed UCB vial for two units tested. The total
number of LTC-ICs for each experiment was obtained by multiplying
the measured TNC count with the frequency of LTC-ICs for each individual
treatment. Each unit is indicated by different symbols. (D) Mean ±
SEM of the yield of LTC-ICs recovered (n = 2). Total
number of LTC-ICs was normalized in each experiment to the total number
obtained in the DMSO control [i.e., LTC-IC yield = (total LTC-IC with
sample)/(total LTC-IC with no compound control) × 100%].

Interestingly, the most effective
IRIs in this study, 2 and 6, provided the
greatest yield of committed progenitors
and multipotent progenitors post-thaw. Moreover, the cryoprotective
ability of the IRIs 2 and 6 was extended
to more immature progenitors. Indeed, the frequency of multipotent
progenitors in UCB LCs was significantly increased 2.5- and 3.2-fold
over 10% DMSO. Moreover, the total yield of multipotent progenitors
was increased 2-fold over control. Importantly, the preservation of
progenitor function during cryopreservation was confirmed to be a
result of the molecules’ ability to inhibit ice recrystallization.
Structurally similar compounds devoid of IRI activity failed to improve
the recovery of myeloid progenitors. Taken together, these results
demonstrate that IRI activity during freezing and thawing of UCB LCs
protects both committed and immature progenitors against cryo-injury
that lead to a significant loss in UCB potency.

Finally, we
investigated the impact of IRIs 2, 6, and 9 on CD34+ cell integrity and viability
post-thaw using Annexin V staining, which detects apoptotic cells.
Although no significant differences were identified, the proportion
of viable CD34+ cells tended to be higher for all IRI-cryoprotected
samples tested when compared with the DMSO control. The results suggest
that this may be the result of decreased loss in CD34+ cells to apoptotis
and/or necrosis, although these results will need to be confirmed
and assessed further in future work. This could be significant because
several studies have indicated that CD34+ cells can exhibit high levels
of apoptosis post-thaw and as a result significant cell loss is experienced
post-thaw.18,48−50 Furthermore,
it has been shown that UCB CD34+ cells with signs of apoptosis (Annexin
V+) fail to engraft when transplanted into immunodeficient mice.18

2.4 Ice Recrystallization Inhibition
Activity
of N-Aryl-aldonamides in the Presence of UCB Cells
The IRI activity of compounds 1–10 was measured utilizing PBS solutions containing 22 mM of compound.
Although this is our standard method for measuring the IRI activity
of newly synthesized molecules, the cryoprotectant solutions were
composed of IRI dissolved in 0.9% saline/0.5% dextran (from Leuconostoc spp., Mr ≈
40 000, Sigma) in water at concentrations different from 22
mM and in the presence of plasma and 10% DMSO. When assessed in PBS,
compounds 2 and 6 were strong IRIs, whereas
compounds 3 and 7 were inactive (Figure 2). We predicted that
IRI active compounds would retain their IRI activity in the presence
of LCs and ice crystals should be noticeably smaller in size in the
presence of an active IRI. Thus, solutions of LCs with active and
inactive IRI compounds were assessed for ice recrystallization inhibition
activity (Figure 7).
The 10% DMSO was excluded from the solutions because, in practice,
concentrations above 6% (v/v) are very difficult to use in this assay
and produce inconsistent results because of large portions of unfrozen
solution in the ice wafer.51 Compared with
PBS (Figure 7, panel
A), blood plasma alone possesses remarkable IRI activity, with a MGS
of 13% (Figure 7, panel
B). This is not surprising as plasma contains many different lipids,
carbohydrates, proteins, and salts. LCs with saline/dextran (cryoprotectant
solution without DMSO or IRI) are less active (24% MGS) when compared
with plasma alone that can be attributed to the dilution of plasma
with saline/dextran (Figure 7, panel C). LCs in plasma and saline/dextran supplemented
with compounds 2 (25 mM) and 6 (27.5 mM)
show increased IRI activity when compared with LCs in plasma and saline/dextran
alone with activities of 9 and 3%, respectively (Figure 7, panels D and E). By contrast,
ineffective IRIs 3 (25 mM) and 7 (55 mM)
that are structurally similar to 2 and 6, respectively, had IRI activities of 18 and 17%, respectively (Figure 7, panels F and G).
These results obtained in LCs confirm the previous results of IRI
activity and support the concept that IRI active compounds 2 and 6 are potent inhibitors of ice recrystallization
in UCB cells during cryopreservation.

compounds after 30 min of ice recrystallization (at −6.4 °C).

In summary, this study identified a series of small molecules
capable
of controlling ice growth and recrystallization. Compounds 2 and 6 with the most potent IRI activity significantly
improved the post-thaw recovery of committed progenitors and multipotent
progenitors when supplemented with the standard cryoprotectant solution
in LCs. These results together with the strong correlation between
engraftment and net TNC and progenitor content (i.e., dose) reported
in clinical studies support the hypothesis that the use of IRIs during
cryopreservation could improve the engraftment capacity of UCB. Future
work will aim to test this hypothesis by performing the transplantation
of IRI-cryopreserved UCB cells into immunodeficient mice. Moreover,
the capacity of these IRIs to protect other cellular products such
as mesenchymal stromal cells will also need to be investigated. In
conclusion, this study demonstrates that the inhibition of ice recrystallization
during freezing and thawing through the addition of IRIs significantly
improves the post-thaw potency of the cryopreserved UCB.

3 Experimental Section
3.1 Splat-Cooling Assay for
Ice Recrystallization
Inhibition Activity
The assessment of IRI activity has been
previously described. Briefly, IRI activity is determined using a
method termed “splat-cooling” assay.52 In this method, an analyte is dissolved in PBS, and a 10
μL droplet of this solution is dropped from a micropipette through
a 2 m high plastic tube (10 cm in diameter) onto a block of polished
aluminum precooled to approximately −80 °C. The droplet
freezes instantly on the polished aluminum block. The resulting wafer
is carefully removed from the surface of the block and transferred
to a cryostage held at −6.4 °C for annealing. After a
period of 30 min, the wafer is photographed between crossed polarizing
filters using a digital camera (Nikon CoolPix 5000) fitted to the
microscope. A total of three images are taken from each wafer, and
this process is repeated with two additional wafers. During flash
freezing, ice crystals spontaneously nucleate from the supercooled
solution. These initial crystals are relatively homogeneous in size
and quite small. During the annealing cycle, recrystallization occurs,
resulting in a dramatic increase in the ice crystal size. Image analysis
of the ice wafers was performed using domain recognition software.
IRI activity is reported as a percentage of MGS of ice crystals in
the presence of the solute when compared with the MGS of ice crystals
in a control solution of PBS.

3.2 Collection
and Processing of Human Umbilical
Cord Blood
UCB was collected following healthy term delivery
and informed consent from mothers, in accordance with institutional
approval from the Research Ethics Board of The Ottawa Hospital (protocol
2006460-01H). The UCB was processed within 48 h of collection. The
UCB was diluted with 6% hetastarch (Hespan) to obtain a final concentration
of 1% hetastarch and incubated for 10 min at room temperature.8 The tubes were then centrifuged at 50g at 10 °C for 15–20 min. For total volumes
up to 30 mL, 15–17 min centrifugation was carried out, and
for total volumes of 30–35 mL, 17–20 min centrifugation
was carried out. The supernatant and buffy coat (plasma and leukocytes)
were removed carefully (not collecting RBCs) from the tubes and were
collected in a 50 mL Falcon tube. This tube was centrifuged at 400g and 10 °C for 10 min to pellet cells. The plasma
was removed and kept on ice. The cell pellet was resuspended and combined
in plasma to a total volume of 20 mL (LC). The LC was kept on ice
for the duration of its use. Total mononuclear (CD45+) and CD34+ cell
concentrations and viability were determined using flow cytometry.

3.3 Cryopreservation of CD34+ Cells
Aliquots
of LC containing 50 000 CD34+ cells were added to 2.0 mL cryovials.
Cryovials were centrifuged at 400g and 10 °C
for 5 min, the supernatant was removed, the plasma was added, and
the cells were suspended by pipetting. Pre-made cryoprotectant solutions
were added, and the cells were mixed by pipetting. For specific volumes
of plasma and cryoprotectant solutions, see the Supporting Information. Cryovials were placed in a Mr. Frosty
rate-controlled freezing container, which was then placed in a −80
°C freezer for 24 h. After 24 h, the cryovials were transferred
to a liquid nitrogen Dewar flask for storage until thawed for analysis.

3.4 Post-Thaw Recovery and Viability of CD34+
and CD45+ Cells from LCs
Flow cytometry analysis was performed
using the ISHAGE-gating strategy (International Society of Hematotherapy
and Graft Engineering) for CD45+ and CD34+ cell measurements.53 Frozen LC samples were thawed in a 37 °C
water bath and analyzed without washing. In short, the
LC was diluted with 10-fold Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline
(DPBS), 200 μL was stained with CD45 fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC) and CD34 phycoerythrin (PE) antibodies, and the mixture was
incubated in the dark at room temperature. 7-AAD was added and incubated
for 5 min. Finally, 20 μL of Countbright counting beads (Life
Technologies) was added, and the suspension was diluted to 1 mL with
1× RBC lysis buffer (BioLegend). Samples were analyzed using
a Beckman Coulter Gallios flow cytometer. The proportions of viable,
apoptotic, and necrotic cells were measured by staining LC with CD34-PE,
CD45RA-allophycocyanin (APC), Annexin V-FITC, and Sytox following
the manufacturer’s directions (Life Technologies).

3.5 CFU and Long-Term Culture-Initiating Cell
(LTC-IC) Assays
Cryovials were thawed in a 37 °C water
bath and diluted with 900 μL of Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s
media (IMDM) (10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin/streptomycin).
Cryovials were placed on ice until washed. The samples were mixed
by pipetting, and 80 μL was transferred to a 15 mL Falcon tube.
IMDM (10% FBS; 5 mL) was added, and this mixture was centrifuged at
1100 rpm for 6 min. The supernatant was removed by aspiration, and
the cell pellet was resuspended in 1 mL of IMDM (2% FBS). The suspension
was mixed by pipetting. 150 μL of this cell suspension was added
to 3 mL of Methocult media, and plating was performed as previously
described.54 Colonies were counted and
scored at day 14 according to the Standardized Guide provided by manufacturer.
LDA was used to measure the frequency of LTC-IC in thawed cryovials
by plating decreasing doses of CB. TNCs (250, 600, 1200, 3000, 6000,
9000, 18 000, and 30 000) were co-cultured for 5 weeks
with the stromal cell line MS-5 on 0.1% gelatin precoated 96-well
flat bottom culture plates in a human long-term culture medium (Myelocult
MS 300) with hydrocortisone. Half medium change was carried out weekly.
After 5 weeks, the entire
well content was transferred to 1 mL of methylcellulose (MethoCult
H4434), and the plates were scored for colony growth or not after
2 weeks. Each dose was tested in 4–9 replicates. LDA was carried
out using the extreme limiting dilution analysis (ELDA) web-based
application.55 All reagents for progenitor
assays were from StemCell Technologies.
