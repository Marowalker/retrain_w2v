Novel antibiotics
are urgently needed. The troponoids [tropones,
tropolones, and α-hydroxytropolones (α-HT)] can have anti-bacterial
activity. We synthesized or purchased 92 troponoids and evaluated
their antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus
aureus, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Preliminary hits were assessed
for minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC80) and cytotoxicity
(CC50) against human hepatoma cells. Sixteen troponoids
inhibited S. aureus/E. coli/A. baumannii growth by ≥80% growth at <30 μM with CC50 values >50 μM. Two selected tropolones (63 and 285) inhibited 18 methicillin-resistant S.
aureus (MRSA) strains with similar MIC80 values as against a reference strain. Two selected thiotropolones
(284 and 363) inhibited multidrug-resistant
(MDR) E. coli with MIC80 ≤30 μM. One α-HT (261) inhibited
MDR-A. baumannii with MIC80 ≤30 μM. This study opens new avenues for development
of novel troponoid antibiotics to address the critical need to combat
MDR bacterial infections.

==== Body
Introduction
The emergence of antimicrobial-resistant
bacteria is a rapidly
growing concern for public health. The economic cost of bacterial
resistance is estimated to be around $55 billion annually in the United
States alone.1 In February 2017, the World
Health Organization (WHO) announced that the highest priority organisms
for development of new antibiotics are carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the Enterobacteriaceae. The first two second-priority organisms
are vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and methicillin-resistant, vancomycin intermediate and resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The discovery and development
of novel antibiotic compounds has been slow. Resistant bacteria spread
and cause infections at increasing rates, and thus there is an urgent
need to develop novel classes of potent antibiotics.2,3 In addition, most new antibiotics are derivatives of existing drugs;
thus, bacterial targets have already been under strong selection to
develop resistance.

Troponoid compounds include the tropones,
tropolones, and hydroxytropolones
and their derivatives. All of them have a seven-carbon ring and possesses
a nonbenzenoid aromatic character.4 Tropone
(2,4,6-cycloheptatrien-1-one) has a ketone group on the troponoid
ring. Tropolone (2-hydroxy-2,4,6-cycloheptatrien-1-one) has an alcohol
(or an enol including the double bond) group next to the ketone. α-Hydroxytropolone
(α-HT) has an additional alcohol group on C7 of the troponoid
ring (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Structures
of (A) tropone, (B) tropolone, and (C) α-HT. Structures
for all compounds tested are in Figure S1.

Tropolone derivatives can have
antibacterial,5−9 antiviral,10−14 antifungal properties,15 anti-tumor,
anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and insecticidal.16,17 Because troponoids have high pharmacological activity, development
of convenient methods of synthesis of their new derivatives and the
search among the derivatives for molecules with antibacterial activity
against drug resistant bacteria are important. Recently, Dr. Ryan
Murelli and coworkers pioneered a novel approach to generate poly-substituted
α-HTs from readily available precursor compounds,18 and Dr. Bahaa Elgendy and coworkers explored
the synthesis of novel thiotropolones. Together, these provided us
the unique opportunity to evaluate the anti-microbial activities of
a wide range of chemically diverse troponoids. Here, 92 natural and
synthetic troponoids were screened for inhibition of bacterial growth
to assess whether they may be attractive candidates for development
into novel antibiotics.

Results
Primary Inhibitor Screening
We measured the effect
of the troponoids on bacterial growth to test whether they had antibiotic
activity. Among the 92 troponoids tested, 18 are tropolones, 26 are
tropones and 48 are α-HT. In the initial qualitative screening,
the 92 compounds were each tested at 5.8, 20.4, and 71.4 μM.
We screened against Escherichia coli (ATCC 35218), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (ATCC BAA-750), Acinetobacter baumannii (Ab1, from a patient), and P. aeruginosa (ATCC 27853). The compounds were diluted in cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton
II broth (CAMHB), and bacteria from overnight cultures were added
to the diluted compounds in a 96-well plate (5 × 105 CFU/mL inoculum for each well). After 16–24 h incubation
at 35 ± 2 °C, the turbidity in the cultures was read at
630 nM in a microplate reader. The percentages of compounds that suppressed
bacterial growth by ≥80% relative to vehicle control cultures
at the screening concentrations are shown for each bacterial species
in Table 1: 9.8 and
8.7% of the compounds inhibited S. saprophyticus and E. coli growth at 15.2 μM,
but at the highest concentration of 71.4 μM, only 20.4% compounds
inhibited A. baumannii. None of the
compounds inhibited P. aeruginosa growth
at 71.4 μM. All results from the full set of 92 troponoids are
in shown Table S1.

MIC80 and CC50 Measurement for Troponoids
The minimal inhibitory concentration 80% (MIC80) and
cytotoxic 50% (CC50) values were measured for compounds
that inhibited S. saprophyticus growth
by ≥80% at 20.4 μM, and also those that demonstrated
≥80% inhibition of E. coli and A. baumannii growth at 71.4 μM in the preliminary
screening (Table 2). An overnight bacterial culture was adjusted
to 5 × 105 CFU/mL and added to 1.5-fold serially diluted
compounds, and turbidity was measured after incubation for 16–24
h. The bacteria (E. coli, A. baumannii, and P. aeruginosa) used in MIC80 measurements were the same as for the
primary screening, but for Staphylococcus, we shifted to S. aureus (ATCC 29213)
because S. aureus is a common pathogen
in the Staphylococcaceae family, whereas S. saprophyticus is a commensal member of the normal human flora. Cytotoxic CC50 values were measured in HepDES19 cells, a HepG2-derived
human hepatoblastoma cell line19 because
the liver is a common site of drug toxicity. Serially diluted troponoid
compounds were added to HepDES19 cells in a final concentration of
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) of 1%. After 3 days of incubation, MTS reagent
was added to cells and the cells were incubated for 90 min prior to
reading absorbance at 480 nm, and CC50 values were calculated
by nonlinear curve fitting. Therapeutic index (TI) values, the ratio
of the amount of a compound that causes 50% toxicity to the amount
that causes 80% efficacy (CC50/MIC80), were
also calculated.

Table 2 MIC80 and TI Values of E. coli, S. aureus, A. baumannii, and P. aeruginosa and CC50 for Selected Compounds
a The therapeutic index, TI, (CC50/MIC80) is provided in parentheses to the right
of the MIC80 values. MIC80 >71.4 μM.

Table 2 shows the
MIC80, CC50, and TI values and the structures
of compounds that inhibited ≥80% growth of S.
aureus at <20 μM, and E. coli and A. baumannii at <30 μM
with CC50 >50 μM. Table S1 shows MIC80 and CC50 values for all 92 troponoids.

Among the 18 tropolones that inhibited S. aureus, 53, 54, and 338 inhibited
growth by >80% at <20 μM with CC50s >50
μM
and TI values of 8.5, 6.0, and 5.1, respectively. Compound 350 inhibited by >80% at 8.8 μM, but its CC50 was
less
than 50 μM (46 μM). The rest of the tropolones, 47 to 50, 52, 55, 195, 340 to 345, and 349 had moderate substitutions on the tropone ring and had decreased
or no activity. The 26 tropones tested were all variants of 53 with modifications to the tropolone hydroxyl, and they
had variable activities. The −OH was changed to a chlorine
in 57, to an aniline in 60, and to a sulfonyl
ester in 61. All three had MIC80 >100 μM.
However, in 363, the oxygen of the hydroxyl group was
changed to sulfur, and activity was only slightly decreased. Inhibition
by several benzoylated variants (62, 63, 282, 283, 284, 285, 348, and 364) was similar to that of 53. However, two benzoylated variants (61 and 346) lost all activity, probably because of sulfonyl ester replacement.
When the thioester in 284 was changed to a thioether
in 365, all inhibitory activity was lost. For the 48
α-HT compounds, six compounds with appendages on the troponoid
ring (46, 114, 120, 146, 261, and 262) inhibited S. aureus at <20 μM. In contrast, 172, which has no substitutions, had an MIC of 66.7 μM.

Regarding the antibacterial activity of troponoids on Gram-negative
rods, including E. coli, Acinetobacter banmannii and P. aeruginosa, four tropones (284, 363, 364 and 680) and two α-HT (261 and 310) inhibited E. coli growth
by >80% at <30 μM with CC50 values >50 μM.
Only two α-HTs (261 and 310) could
inhibit A. baumannii by >80% at
<30
μM with CC50s >50 μM. None of the compounds
inhibited P. aeruginosa at 71.4 μM,
the highest concentration employed.

Inhibition of Multidrug-Resistant S. aureus Strains by Compounds 63 and 285
Next, we selected the top two primary hits against S. Saprophyticus and S. aureus based on MIC80 and CC50 values, 63 and 285, to determine if they inhibit other S. aureusATCC strains and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). The MRSA strains were collected
at the St Louis VA Medical Center (STLVAMC) under STLVAMC Subcommittee
on Research Safety (SRS)-approved protocols. All MRSA strains are
cefoxitin-screen positive and resistant to oxacillin. As shown in Table 3, the MIC80 of compounds 63 and 285 against S. aureus ATCC strains and clinical MRSA strains
ranged from 5.9 to 13.2 μM, similar to the value (8.8 μM)
against the S. aureus strain (ATCC
29213) used for the initial MIC80 measurements. In addition
to being resistant to oxacillin, 15 of 18 MRSA strains were also resistant
to the fluoroquinolone class antibiotic ciprofloxacin, 12 were resistant
to protein synthesis inhibitor class antibiotic clindamycin, one was
resistant to the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor class antibiotic
rifampicin, and two were resistant to the folate synthesis inhibitor
class antibiotic trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Compounds 63 and 285 had similar potency in all drug-resistant S. aureus strains, indicating that they have different
target(s) from the existing antibiotics tested against which the strains
had been profiled.

Inhibition of Multidrug-Resistant
Gram-Negative Strains by Compounds 284, 363, and 261
Compounds 284 and 363 inhibited growth of E. coli. Therefore, we tested whether they could
inhibit multidrug-resistant (MDR) E. coli. All tested MDR bacteria are resistant to at least three classes
of antibiotics among quinolones/fluorquinolones, carbapenems, cephalosporins,
aminoglycosides, and piperacillin–tazobactam. Compounds 284 and 363 inhibited five MDR E. coli (Ec1-5) strains with MIC80 values
≤30 μM (Table 4). We also tested 261, an inhibitor of A. baumannii, for inhibition of five MDR A. baumannii strains and found that it inhibited
them with MIC80 ≤30 μM (Table 4).

Time-Killing Curves and Bactericidal/Bacteriostatic Measurements
We next determined time-killing curves of representative inhibitors
and whether they were bactericidal or bacteriostatic against S. aureus (ATCC 29213) and E. coli (ATCC 35218) strains. Compounds were diluted into CAMHB medium to
a final concentration of 0, 1, 4, and 16 times their MIC80s. Overnight cultures of the test bacteria were added to the compounds.
Samples were taken immediately and approximately 3, 6, 24, and 30
h after the addition of compounds and plated onto blood agar. The
numbers of colonies appearing on the plate after 24 h of incubation
at 37 °C were counted. Compounds 63 and 285 reduced the colony count by only 1 log10 unit within
24 h in 1× MIC80. However, at 4× MIC80, they completely killed the bacteria after 5 or 8 h, while at 16×
MIC80, there was only a 2 log10 reduction in
the colony count within 24 h for both 63 and 285. This paradoxical effect in which inhibition decreases over a range
of increasing compound concentrations has been previously observed
with β-thujaplicin (47 in our nomenclature).8 A similar paradoxical effect has also been described
for β-lactam antibiotics against Gram positive bacteria20−22 and for other antibiotics–microorganism combinations.23,24 This phenomenon, which was demonstrated in vitro and in vivo,24 is related to β-lactamase production,24 alteration in the synthesis or activity of an
autolysin,25 binding to human albumin,
as well as high-density inoculum of stationary cells.26

The time-killing curves for compounds 284 and 363 against E. coli revealed a 1–2 log10 reduction from 4 to 30 h
for 1× and 4× MIC80. At 16× MIC80, there was about a 3 log10 reduction within 6 h, then
about a 2–4 log10 reduction after 24 h for 284 and 363. These results indicate that the
troponoids can be bacteriostatic for E. coli and bactericidal for S. aureus under
certain doses and compound exposures.

Compounds 63 and 285 Inhibit S. aureus Independently of the Capsule and the CapF
Protein
Nakano et al. reported that 3-isopropenyl-tropolone
(349) can bind to CapF, which catalyzes synthesis of
a key precursor of capsular polysaccharide.27 Therefore, we asked if the MIC80s of 63, 285, and 349 against S. aureus strains G01 and F4 were altered relative to strain Newman. F4 is
Newman with ermB-inactivated cap5F gene and G01 is Newman with the ermB-inactivated cap5G gene. Production of capsule polysaccharide is abolished
in both the G01 and F4 strains. Compound 349 slightly
inhibited the wild-type Newman but did not inhibit the F4 and G01
strains. However, both 63 and 285 inhibited
Newman, F4 and G01 with similar MIC80s (Table 5). Because the capsular protein
is not essential for bacterial growth, from this growth inhibition
assay, we cannot conclude whether the CapF is the target of the compounds
tested or not, but the significant inhibition and/or killing of both
wild type and capsular protein-ablated mutants indicate that neither
capsule nor CapF protein are essential for action of 63 and 285.

Discussion
In this study, we determined the antibacterial
activities of 92
troponoids. Nine tropones (51, 62, 63, 282–285, 348, and 364), three tropolones (53, 54,
and 338), and two α-HTs (261 and 262) inhibited S. aureus/S. saprophyticus growth by ≥80% at <20
μM with CC50s in human cells >50 μM. Compounds 261, 284, 310, 363, 364, and 680 inhibited E. coli, and 261 and 310 inhibited A. baumannii growth by ≥80% at <30 μM
with CC50s >50 μM. Compounds 261, 284, 363, and 364, which inhibited
Gram-negative bacteria, also inhibited Gram-positive bacteria modestly,
but the opposite is not true, as 51, 53, 282, 283, 285, 338,
and 348 inhibited S. aureus at <20 μM, but could not inhibit E. coli, A. baumannii, or P. aeruginosa. The broad anti-bacterial activity
of β-thujaplicin (Hinokitiol, 47) and γ-thujaplicin
(48) was reported several decades ago.8,28,29 Our results revealed modest inhibition of
both Gram-positive bacteria (S. aureus) and Gram-negative rods (E. coli and A. banmannii), which is consistent with previous
reports (Table S1). Two α-HT, 261 and 262, also showed broad inhibition against
both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (Table 2). However, the CC50 values were
around 50 μM, so there is little to no TI compared to their
effects on human cells.

Nine of 15 benzoylated tropolones (51, 62, 63, 282, 283, 284, 285, 348,
and 364) inhibited
growth of S. aureus by ≥80%
at <20 μM with CC50 values >50 μM (Table 2). Two benzoylated
tropolones (281 and 339) had modest inhibition.
These benzoylated tropolones all have a troponoid ring connected to
a benzoate through an ester linkage, or in the case of 284, 348, and 364, a thioester linkage. Because
the addition of the benzene ring did not affect inhibition of bacterial
growth significantly, we assume that the benzene ring is not a primary
determinant of antibacterial activity, but they can affect the interaction
between the tropolone ring and the target.

Compounds 284, 364, and 363 inhibited MDR E. coli with MIC80 ≤30 μM. 364 is a derivative of 284 lacking the methyl
group on the benzene moiety, and it
had an efficacy similar to 284. As the thioester bond
in 284 is unlikely to be stable in culture, we synthesized
one of the putative esterase products, thiotropolone (compound 363). As shown in Table 2, 363 was more active than 284 (14.8 μM vs 24.1 μM). This indicates that the minimal
active component of our primary screening hit was thiotropolone 363. To expand the assessment of thiotropolones as inhibitors
of E. coli growth, Dr. Elgendy synthesized
10 new compounds with different modifications on the troponoid ring
and the right arm (677–686). Compounds 677, 678, 680, 681, 684, and 685 have the thiotropolone core structure and
they inhibited E. coli growth at <20
μM (Table S1 and Figure S1). As expected, compound 683, which
has the oxygen replaced sulfur atom next to the ketone group on the
troponoid ring, is inactive against E. coli. Compound 686 has the thiotropolone core, but is inactive,
indicating that the right arm somehow participates in the interaction
of thiotropolone with the bacterial target, potentiates compound degradation,
and/or induces their efflux from the cells. These data further demonstrate
that thiotropolone is the core structure in these compounds for the
anti-bacterial activity against E. coli, but that modifications to the tropolone ring and thiol moieties
can affect efficacy. 284 and 363 can also
inhibit growth of the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus
neoformans with an MIC80 of 0.25 μM15 and unpublished data. However, it is unknown
whether they inhibit the bacteria and C. neoformans by the same mechanisms.

Two compounds, 63 and 285, also inhibited
other S. aureus ATCC strains and MRSA S. aureus strains collected from patients with similar
MIC80 values as against ATCC reference strains. These clinical
isolates and ATCC strains had extensive but differing resistance patterns
to a set of common clinically relevant antibiotics including oxacillin,
gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, clindamycin, and trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole
in addition to methicillin. For Gram-negative rods, compounds 284, 363, and 364 inhibited E. coli and MDR-E. coli with MIC80 ≤30 μM. Meanwhile, compound 261 inhibited MDR A. baumannii with MIC80 ≤30 μM. These clinical isolates
also had extensive but differing resistance patterns to a set of common
clinically relevant antibiotics including ampicillin–sulbactam,
piperacillin–tazobactam, cefazolin, ceftriaxone, cefepime,
gentamicin, tobramycin, ciprofloxacin, nitrofurantoin, and trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole.
The inhibition of these MDR bacteria indicates the compounds tested,
and possibly the other troponoids, have different bacterial targets
from the common existing antibiotics.

The biological effects
of troponoid compounds are typically due
to coordination of cations in the active sites of metalloenzymes.30−32 For example, the α-HTs inhibit the HIV ribonuclease H by coordinating
the two Mg2+ ions in the active site,33 and they are believed to act the same way against the hepatitis
B virus ribonuclease H.34 Similarly, tropolone
has been reported to inhibit several Zn2+-dependent metalloenzymes.35−37 Finally, CapF is a bifunctional metalloenzyme which is essential
in the biosynthetic route of capsular polysaccharide. Isothermal titration
calorimetry demonstrates that 3-isopropenyl-tropolone (349) binds (Kd = 27 ± 7 μM) to
the cupin domain of CapF. In addition, the crystal structure of the
enzyme–inhibitor complex shows that the compound engages the
essential Zn2+ ion necessary for the first reaction catalyzed
by the enzyme and alters the coordination sphere of the metal, leading
to the overall destabilization of the enzyme.27 However, from the MIC80 against S. aureus Newman and F4 (with ermB-inactivated cap5F gene), 349 can only slightly inhibit Newman growth
and cannot inhibit the F4 growth, while 63 and 285 can significantly inhibit the growth of Newman and F4.
In addition, the time-killing assay showed that 63 and 285 are bactericidal for a MRSA strain. Although this growth
inhibition assay does not distinguish whether 63 and 285 can bind to CapF or not, we can conclude that the target(s)
of 63 and 285 must be something in addition
to or other than CapF because the capsule is not essential for the
growth of S. aureus. Through screening
of a chelator fragment library, tropolone was identified as an inhibitor
of the Zn2+-dependent virulence factor, P. aeruginosa elastase (LasB).37 However, none of the troponoid compounds inhibited growth
of P. aeruginosa at <71.4 μM
in our assay. This could be because LasB is not essential for the
growth of P. aeruginosa, although our
growth inhibition assay cannot determine whether the troponoids bind
to LasB or not. The mechanism(s) of troponoid inhibition is unknown,
but the bactericidal property of investigated compounds (63 and 285, Figure 2) in certain concentrations indicates that they disrupt the
function of bacterial target(s) essential for bacterial viability.

Figure 2 Time-killing
curves for compounds 63 and 285 against S. aureus (ATCC 29213) and
for 284 and 363 against E.
coli (ATCC 35218).

These data greatly expand knowledge regarding the antibacterial
efficacy of the troponoids. Importantly, the activity of these compounds
against a panel of highly drug-resistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative
bacteria indicates that they act by mechanism(s) distinct from existing
clinically used antibiotics. Therefore, this study opens up a new
avenue for development of novel troponoids antibiotics to address
the critical and urgent need for novel drugs to combat serious bacterial
infections.

Experimental Section
Compound Acquisition and Synthesis
The compounds employed
are listed in Table S1.

Compounds
were acquired commercially or were synthesized as described below.
Compounds 46–57 and 195 were acquired
from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Developmental Therapeutics
Program. Compounds 60–63, 210, 281–285, and 348–350 were purchased.
Compound 172 was synthesized according to a published
procedure.38 Compounds 106–120, 143–147, 173, 273–274, and 335 were synthetized from kojic acid as previously
described.11,39−41 Compounds 257–259, 280, 308–313, 315, 317–319, 336, and 347 were synthesized as previously described.15,42 Compounds 261–264 were made using the Banwell
method.43 Compound 363 was
synthesized from 2-cholorotropone and sodium hydrosulfide.44 Compound 364 was synthesized from 363 according to the procedure of Nozoe.45 Compound 365 was synthesized according to
a published procedure.46 For the synthesis
of compounds 675–682, 684–686 (675 = 363 and 676 = 364), see Supporting Information Compounds were ≥95% pure by 1H NMR analysis. The
analytical data for all published compounds are consistent with that
reported previously. They were dissolved in DMSO at 10 mM and stored
in opaque tubes at −80 °C.

Bacterial Strains
The commercially acquired bacterial
strains were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).
The clinical MRSA, MDR Enterobacteriaceae, and A. baumannii strains were collected from the microbiology laboratory at the John
Cochran division of the St. Louis VA Health care system (STLVAHCS)
under STLVAHCS Subcommittee on Research Safety (SRS)-approved protocols. S. aureus Newman, G01, and F4 were kindly provided
by Dr. Jean Lee. G01 is Newman with ermB-inactivated cap5G gene and F4 is Newman with ermB-inactivated cap5F gene.47

Determination
of the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration
MIC80s
were determined by the broth microdilution method
recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)
in CAMHB. In the preliminary screening, three compound concentrations
were used: 5.8, 20.4, and 71.4 μM; In quantitative MIC80 measurements, a 1.5-fold dilution series of the compounds was prepared
in CAMHB. Overnight bacterial culture was added to the diluted compounds
in a 96-well plate after adjusting the bacterial concentration to
achieve a 5 × 105 CFU/mL final concentration. After
16–24 h incubation at 35 ± 2 °C, the plates were
read at 630 nM in a microplate reader. The MIC80 was defined
as the concentration of an antibacterial agent that inhibited bacteria
growth ≥80% compared to untreated control cultures. All values
were determined at least twice independently, and the average number
is reported.

MTS Cytotoxicity Assays (CC50)
HepDES19
cells19 (1.0 × 104 cells
per well) were seeded in 96-well plates and incubated in Dulbecco’s
modified eagle medium with 10% fetal bovine serum plus 1% penicillin/streptomycin
solution, 1% nonessential amino acids, and 1% glutamine. The compounds
were diluted in the medium to the indicated concentrations to a final
concentration of 1% DMSO and added to the cells 48 h after plating,
with each concentration tested in triplicate. Soluble MTS reagent
[3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, Promega] was added 72 h after incubation,
the cultures were incubated for 90 min, and absorbance was read at
490 nm. The CC50 was calculated as the concentration of
the inhibitor required to reduce cell viability 50% relative to untreated
cells. The data are plotted as log[inhibitor] versus response and
fit to a variable slope model using Graph Pad Prism.15

Time-Killing Curve and Bactericidal/Bacteriostatic
Measurement
Compounds were diluted into CAMHB medium containing
0 (vehicle-treatment
control), 1, 4, or 16 times the MIC80. Approximately 105 CFU/mL of the test bacteria from overnight cultures were
added to the compound solutions. Samples were taken immediately and
3, 6, 24, and 30 h after the addition of compounds and plated onto
blood agar. The numbers of colonies appearing on the plate after 24
h of incubation at 37 °C were counted.48
