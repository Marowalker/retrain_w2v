Flame
retardant tris(2-chloroethyl phosphate) (TCP) is successfully
encapsulated in core–shell poly(urea-formaldehyde) microcapsules
by in situ polymerization. The microcapsules are electrochemically
stable in lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery electrolytes and thermally
stable to ca. 200 °C. Thermal triggering of these microcapsules
at higher temperatures ruptures the shell wall, releasing the liquid
core (flame retardant), and NMR spectroscopy confirms the presence
of the flame retardant in the electrolyte solution. Li-ion pouch cell
experiments demonstrate that microencapsulation of TCP and its incorporation
into the battery electrolyte provide latent fire retardants that improve
battery safety while maintaining inherent battery performance and
cycling capability.

==== Body
Introduction
Lithium-ion batteries are widely used
in consumer electronics,
such as cell phones and laptops. However, safety concerns have been
an obstacle for the large-scale development of Li-ion batteries and
high-power battery modules, such as those required for electric vehicle
applications.1−3 Many of the safety hazards arise from chemical reactions
between electrode materials and electrolyte constituents at elevated
temperatures. These reactions are highly exothermic, and the generated
heat can accelerate reactions, causing catastrophic thermal runaway.2,4−7 Cells undergoing thermal runaway vent violently, and flammable electrolyte
solvents coupled with O2 exposure can trigger combustion
of the battery.

Recent research on battery safety has focused
on the development
of nonflammable electrolytes by incorporating additives that inhibit
the chemical reactions that occur during combustion.1,8−12 Many flame-retardant species contain phosphorus compounds,13,14 which are efficient radical scavengers. The combustion process is
exothermic, powered by free-radical reactions, and the existence of
radical stabilizers impedes combustion.15 Other types of flame retardants include nitrogen-containing compounds
that release inert gaseous byproducts (such as CO2, SO3, or N2) to form a highly porous char that provides
thermal insulation and impedes the combustion front from propagating
and spreading.16,17 Most flame-retardant additives
for Li-ion batteries are directly added to the electrolyte; however,
it has been found that this approach significantly compromises battery
performance (i.e., cycling capacity4,8,12,13,18 and ionic conductivity1,19) at the concentrations
required to reduce flammability.

To avoid sacrificing battery
performance while retaining improved
safety, we propose the use of core–shell microcapsules for
sequestering flame retardants within the battery electrolyte. Encapsulation
isolates the flame retardant from the electrolyte so that the normal
operation of the battery is unaffected. The shell wall of the capsules
provides a barrier for the (often highly toxic) flame-retardant chemicals
from outgassing over time. The incorporation of microcapsules also
provides a uniquely tailorable delivery platform for their chemical
payload. In this case, the capsules are designed to rupture upon exposure
to a critical temperature, thus enabling on-demand release when thermal
runaway is imminent. Given the variety of capsule shell wall compositions
and thicknesses available, the triggering temperature can be tailored
to particular applications and cell designs. The venting temperature
of a battery is highly dependent on the chemistry of the active materials,
battery packaging design, and the individual cell geometry. Finally,
isolating the flame retardant within polymeric microcapsules allows
for the use of a broader spectrum of flame retardants in Li-ion batteries
because the compound is sequestered (and chemically isolated) from
the battery electrolyte.

Although encapsulation of flame retardants
to improve battery safety
has been attempted in the past,20−22 electrochemically stable microcapsules
with a core–shell morphology containing flame retardants have
not been achieved to date. In this work, we describe the encapsulation
of tris(2-chloroethyl phosphate) (TCP), a commercial flame retardant
that is used in commodity plastics, foams, textiles, and, most recently,
in Li-ion batteries,23 in a poly(urea-formaldehyde)
(pUF) core–shell microcapsule. The microcapsules are electrochemically
stable in two commercial Li-ion electrolytes and are thermally stable
until triggering rupture at ca. 200 °C.

Results and Discussion
Microcapsules containing TCP were prepared by in situ polymerization
of urea and formaldehyde following the encapsulation procedure described
by Jin et al.24 Formalin (27.5 g, pH adjusted
to 8 with triethanolamine) and urea (10.5 g) were first prereacted
at 70 °C for 1 h in a separate vessel. A surfactant solution
of ethylene maleic anhydride and water was prepared and mechanically
agitated. The UF prepolymer solution (6.19 g) was added to the surfactant
solution under mechanical agitation, followed by emulsification of
the core material (5 mL). The reaction vessel was heated to 35 °C.
When the temperature reached 30 °C, the pH was adjusted to 2.5
with formic acid. Upon reaching 34 °C, 4.16 mL of H2O was added, followed by addition of 2.05 mL of H2O every
15 min thereafter for 1 h. The reaction was then allowed to proceed
for 4 h at 35 °C.

After completion of the reaction, microcapsules
were centrifuged
in water to remove excess surfactant and filter-dried in air. Microcapsules
produced using this procedure have an average diameter of 137 and
43 μm when prepared at 1500 and 3000 rpm, respectively, with
a rough surface morphology, as shown in Figures 1a and 2b.

Figure 2 Thermogravimetric analysis of microcapsules. Neat capsules were
prepared at 3000 rpm and were soaked in the LiClO4 ethylene
carbonate (EC)/dimethyl carbonate (DMC) electrolyte before TGA scanning
at 10 °C/min.

The stability of microcapsules
in two common battery electrolytes
(1 M LiClO4 EC/DMC and 1 M LiPF6 EC/ethyl methyl
carbonate (EMC)) was investigated. A standard concentration of 1 M
was used throughout the electrolyte experiments described in this
work. Microcapsules prepared at 1500 and 3000 rpm were soaked for
48 h, 1 week, and 1 month intervals in electrolytes. After the prescribed
soak time had elapsed, microcapsules were filter-dried to isolate
them from the electrolyte and their mass loss as a function of temperature
was investigated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Representative
traces for 3000 rpm microcapsules soaked in LiClO4 EC/DMC
are shown in Figure 2, with mass retention data for both capsule types and both electrolytes
tabulated in Table 1. Mass loss prior to 100 °C is attributed to residual moisture
trapped in the rough surface morphology of the microcapsules. Microcapsules
soaked in the electrolyte display nearly identical mass loss profiles
consistent with stable behavior up to 1 month of electrolyte exposure.
The total mass loss from 130 to 400 °C was taken as a measure
of TCP content (bp = 192 °C) and is reported in Table 1. The TCP content is nearly
identical in all cases, irrespective of the type of electrolyte, exposure
time, or size of capsule.

The ability of the microcapsules to release their content in response
to exposure to a critical (trigger) temperature was assessed by preparing
vials of suspensions of microcapsules in the electrolyte (LiClO4 EC/DMC) and exposing the suspensions to a hot silicone oil
bath for 1 min. After the thermal exposure, the vials were allowed
to cool to room temperature and phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance
(Ph-NMR) spectroscopy was used to identify and measure the amount
of core (TCP) released from the microcapsules. An authentic sample
with 5 wt % TCP directly added to the LiClO4 EC/DMC electrolyte
was prepared and scanned to provide a reference case for direct measurement
of the TCP content. A suspension of 5 wt % microcapsules in the electrolyte
was also examined by Ph-NMR to determine the amount of residual TCP
that may have remained on the exterior shell wall from the microencapsulation
process. Finally, two suspensions consisting of 5 wt % microcapsules
in the electrolyte were prepared and heated to 200 and 240 °C,
respectively, and then examined by Ph-NMR. Using triphenyl phosphate
(10 mg/mL in CDCl3) as an internal standard for Ph-NMR,
the amount of core release was calculated for each case and is reported
in Table 2. For the
unheated sample, only about 9.8% core release was measured. Upon exposure
to 200 °C, nearly 30% core release occurs, and at 236 °C,
nearly complete (80.9%) core (TCP) release was measured.

Li-ion pouch cells were fabricated with TCP-containing
microcapsules
and subjected to electrochemical cycling to assess their performance.
The cells consisted of a Li(Ni1/3Co1/3 Mn1/3)O2 (Li333) cathode and mesocarbon microbead
anode. The electrolyte used was 1 M LiClO4 EC/DMC. Cells
were first cycled three times at C/20 from 3.0 to 4.2 V versus Li
at room temperature (25 °C) to perform the formation cycles.
Afterward, cells were cycled 50 times at 1C rate while measuring the
charge capacity (Figure 3). In both the control case (no TCP addition) and the 5 wt % TCP
microcapsule case, the specific charge capacity stabilized quickly
and was maintained throughout the experiments. For the 10 wt % TCP
microcapsule case, stabilization of cycling performance took slightly
longer (ca. 20 cycles) and the equilibrium-specific charge capacity
was reduced by about 10%. In sharp contrast, for both 5 and 10 wt
% direct addition of TCP to the electrolyte, the capacity steadily
decreased for 50 cycles, retaining only about 50% of the initial specific
charge capacity.

performance at 1C, LiClO4 EC/DMC electrolyte. Microcapsule
fabrication at 3000 rpm (ca. 43 μm diameter). Note: three formation
cycles at C/20 were performed in all cases prior to 1C cycling.

We also examined the effect of
flame retardant on the ionic conductivity
of electrolyte. It is well known that as the flammability of the electrolyte
is reduced (by the addition of flame retardants) ionic conductivity
is reduced1 (Figure 4a). However, the sequestration of the flame
retardant within the polymeric microcapsule, isolated from the electrolyte,
is shown to be an effective approach to maintaining ionic conductivity
while simultaneously reducing electrolyte flammability by the incorporation
of a flame retardant (Figure 4b).

Conclusions
A method to incorporate a flame-retardant battery
additive within
Li-ion battery cells in a manner that does not degrade or sacrifice
the regular battery performance but allows on-demand (heat triggered)
release of the additive to prevent battery combustion was developed.
Polymeric (UF prepolymer) microcapsules containing the TCP flame retardant
were prepared at two different capsule diameters. Microcapsules of
both sizes are stable in the two commercial Li-ion battery electrolytes
(LiClO4 EC/DMC and LiPF6 EC/EMC). Thermal triggering
was investigated by dispersing the microcapsules in the battery electrolyte
and simulating overheating conditions. Upon exposure to 236 °C,
microcapsules released approximately 81% of the TCP core content.
Finally, it was demonstrated that the presence of microcapsules neither
affects the cycling performance at 1C rate nor reduces the ionic conductivity
significantly. Because the microencapsulation technique produces robust
and battery-stable microcapsules, it allows for a highly customizable
core delivery system applicable to a wide variety of battery chemistries
and their unique additive requirements.
