The study tackles one of the challenges
in developing platinum-free
molecular electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution, which is to seek
for new possibilities to ensure large turnover numbers by stabilizing
electrocatalytic intermediates. These species are often much more
reactive than the initial electrocatalysts, and if not properly
stabilized by a suitable choice of functionalizing substituents, they
have a limited long-time activity. Here, we describe new iron and
cobalt(II) cage complexes (clathrochelates) that in contrast to many
previously reported complexes of this type do not act as electrocatalysts
for hydrogen evolution. We argue that the most probable reason for
this behavior is an excessive stabilization of the metal(I) species
by perfluoroaryl ribbed groups, resulting in an unprecedented long-term
stability of the metal(I) complexes even in acidic solutions.

Introduction
Cobalt clathrochelates,1 which are polyazomethine-based
cage complexes, have been recently recognized as efficient electrocatalysts
for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at low overpotentials;2 however, the mechanism of their electrocatalytic
activity is still not fully understood. In some cases, cobalt(II)
clathrochelates were shown to function only as precatalysts that produced
electrocatalytically active nanoparticles3 under acidic conditions, whereas in others, they themselves were
homogenous electrocatalysts that required a very small overpotential.2c In contrast to the former, the latter have halogen
atoms as their ribbed substituents; they keep the potential of the
Co2+/+ reduction close to the thermodynamic potential for
the HER2c and increase the chemical stability
of Co+ intermediate species,4 which is a prerequisite for a large catalytic turnover number. Electromeric
characteristic of halogen atoms resemble those of (per)fluoroaryl
groups,5 so that suitably decorated clathrochelates
can show similar electrocatalytic activity but have the stability
that is even higher.6 Indeed, (per)fluorinated
iron and cobalt(II) clathrochelates with pendant (per)fluoroarylsulfide
substituents are known to withstand harsh acidic conditions.7 In these complexes, however, the presence of
bridging sulfur atoms does not allow the (per)fluoroaryl groups to
stabilize the reduced (and probably electrocatalytically active) metal(I)-containing
intermediate.7 Removing these atoms may
potentially open a new pathway to better (more efficient and more
stable) clathrochelate-based electrocatalysts for the HER, which are
functional analogs of macrocyclic BF2-cross-linked iron(II)
complexes of perfluoroaryl-substituted α-dioximates earlier
used for this purpose.8 Here, we report
iron and cobalt(II) (per)fluoroclathrochelates with inherent perfluoroaryl
ribbed substituents, which can be obtained by a simple one-pot synthetic approach, and their behavior in the HER.

Experimental
Section
Materials and Physical Measurements
The reagents used,
FeCl2·4H2O, CoCl2·6H2O, n-butylboronic, phenylboronic and pentafluorophenylboronic
acids, sorbents, and organic solvents, were obtained commercially
(SAF). 1,2-Bis(perfluorophenyl)ethane-1,2-dion dioxime (perfluoro-α-benzildioxime,
denoted as (C6F5)2GmH2), was prepared from dichloroglyoxime as described in ref8, using a modified synthetic
procedure (see below).

Analytical data (C, H, and N contents)
were obtained with a Carlo Erba model 1106 microanalyzer. Iron, boron,
and fluorine contents were determined spectrophotometrically. The
cobalt content was determined by X-ray fluorescence analysis.

Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF)
mass spectra in positive and negative ranges were recorded with a
MALDI-TOF-MS Bruker Autoflex II (Bruker Daltonics) mass spectrometer
in a reflecto-mol mode. Ionization was induced by an UV-laser with
the wavelength 337 nm. The samples were applied to a nickel plate;
2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) was used as a matrix. The accuracy
of measurements was 0.1%.

IR spectra of the solid samples (KBr
tablets) in the range of 400–4000
cm–1 were recorded with a Nicolet Magna-IR 750 Fourier-transform
infrared spectrophotometer.

UV–vis spectra of their solutions
in dichloromethane and
tetrahydrofuran (THF) were recorded in the range of 230–900
nm with a Varian Cary 50 spectrophotometer. Individual Gaussian components
of these spectra were calculated with a Fityk program.9

1H, 13C, and 19F
nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded from CD2Cl2 and CD3CN solutions with a Bruker Avance 400 and 600
spectrometers. Chemical shifts were referenced relative to the residual
signals of these deuterated solvents (1H 5.32 and 1.93
ppm and 13C 53.40 and 1.30 ppm for CD2Cl2 and CD3CN, respectively); 19F NMR chemical
shifts were referenced to the external CFCl3.

X-band
electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra for the cobalt(II)
complexes were acquired on a Bruker ESP 300E spectrometer. Their
glassy samples were obtained from 5 mM dichloromethane solutions at
the temperature of liquid nitrogen (77.4 K) using a quartz finger
dewar. The EPR spectra were registered with the following parameters:
microwave frequency, 9.55 GHz; microwave power, 5 mW; modulation frequency,
100 kHz; modulation amplitude, 2 G; conversion time, 16 ms; time constant,
20 ms; and resolution, 1024 points. The EPR spectra simulation was
performed using EasySpin.10

Cyclic
voltammetry (CV) experiments were performed for the acetonitrile
solutions with 0.1M (n-C4H9)4NClO4 as the supporting electrolyte, using
a Metrohm Autolab PGSTAT128N potentiostat with a conventional one-compartment
three-electrode cell (5 mL of solution). A glassy carbon electrode
(MF-2012, BASi), which has been used as the working electrode, was
thoroughly polished with alumina slurry, sonicated for 2 min, and
rinsed before every measurement. A platinum wire counter electrode
and a standard Ag/AgCl/NaClaq reference electrode (RE-5B,
BASi) were used. To account for the drift of the reference electrode,
ferrocene was used as an internal standard, and all the measured potentials
are reported relative to the Fc/Fc+ redox couple. The solutions
were thoroughly deaerated by passing argon through them before the
CV experiments and above these solutions during the measurements.

Magnetic measurements were performed using a Quantum Design PPMS-9
device under an applied dc field of 1 kOe. Finely ground microcrystalline
powders were immobilized in a mineral oil matrix inside a polyethylene
capsule. The magnetic data were corrected for the sample holder, the
mineral oil, and the diamagnetic contribution.

Gas chromatography
analysis of the gases evolved during the electrolysis
was performed with a Chromatec-Crystal 5005.2 gas chromatograph equipped
with a thermal conductivity detector. The hydrogen content in the
gaseous mixture was quantitatively detected using a 0.5 m-in-length
60/80 Carboxen-1000 column with an internal diameter 3 mm at 200 °C
for the detector and at 60 °C for the oven. The carrier gas was
argon flowing at a rate of 15 mL min–1. The injections
(250 μL) were performed via a sampling loop. The retention time
of gaseous H2 was 1.61 min.

Co K-edge XANES and X-ray
absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra
for the cobalt(II) complex Co((C6F5)2Gm)3(BC6F5)2 (3) and for its reduced derivative ((CH3)4N)[CoI((C6F5)2Gm)3(BC6H5)2] (7) were measured
at the Structural Materials Science beamline of the Kurchatov Synchrotron
Radiation Source (NRC “Kurchatov Institute”, Moscow).11 White synchrotron beam was monochromatized with
a Si(111) channel-cut monochromator. Beam intensities before and after
the samples were measured with ion chambers filled with nitrogen–argon
mixtures to provide 20 and 80% transmittance, respectively. The energy
scale was calibrated against the experimental spectrum of Co foil
measured under identical conditions by assigning the energy of 7709
eV to the maximum derivative point. Preliminary data processing and
analysis, including nonlinear curve fitting with ab initio theoretical
standards, were performed using Athena and Artemis codes from the
IFEFFIT software package.12

Synthesis

Magnesium
turnings (4.0 g, 180 mmol) and THF (30 mL) were placed
in a 500 mL flask, and a solution of C6F5Br
(22.4 mL, 180 mmol) in THF (30 mL) was added dropwise to the boiling
reaction mixture under intensive stirring. The reaction mixture was
refluxed for 30 min, then cooled to −10 °C, and a solution
of dichloroglyoxime (7.0 g, 45 mmol) in THF (25 mL) was added dropwise.
The reaction mixture was stirred at this temperature for 1 h and then
left overnight at r.t. The obtained dark-red solution was evaporated
to approximately 30 mL and diluted with NH4Cl aqueous solution
(10 g in 150 mL) under stirring. After evaporation of THF, the beige
precipitate was filtered off and recrystallized from a methanol–water

solutions in dichloromethane–hexane and benzene–iso-octane mixtures, respectively. The intensities of reflections
were measured at 120.0(2) K with a Bruker Apex II charge-coupled device
diffractometer using Mo Kα (for 4, λ = 0.71073

method and refined by full-matrix least squares against F2. Nonhydrogen atoms were refined in anisotropic approximation.
Hydrogen atoms were included in the refinement by the riding model
with Uiso(H) = nUeq(C), where n = 1.5 for methyl groups and
1.2 for the other atoms. The unit cell of the complex 6·CH2Cl2 contains four solvate dichloromethane
molecules, which have been treated as a diffuse contribution to the
overall scattering without specific atom positions by SQUEEZE/PLATON.13 All calculations were made using the SHELXTL14 and OLEX215 program
packages. The crystallographic data and experimental details are listed
in Table S1 (see Supporting Information). CCDC 1061775–1061777 contain the supplementary crystallographic

Results and Discussion
The first cage complex of this
series, Fe((C6F5)2Gm)3(Bn-C4H9)2 (1), has been synthesized6 in a
two-step procedure that includes perfluoroarylation
with Cu(C6F5) of the hexaiodoclathrochelate
precursor Fe(I2Gm)3(Bn-C4H9)2 (8, I2Gm2– is diiodoglyoxime dianion), which needs to be isolated
for each type of apical capping groups before that. We failed to isolate
its cobalt(II) analogues because of their lower thermodynamic stability
and side redox reactions they undergo under vigorous reaction conditions.

At the same time, pentafluorophenylboron-capped iron and cobalt(II)
hexachloroclathrochelates Fe(Cl2Gm)3(BC6F5)2 and Co(Cl2Gm)3(BC6F5)2 (Cl2Gm2– is dichloroglyoxime dianion) have been recently synthesized7 by a one-pot template condensation
of a weakly donor dichloroglyoxime with pentafluorophenylboronic acid
with the metal ion as a matrix and trifluoroacetic acid as a solvent
(under vigorous reaction conditions). The purpose of using this rather
unusual solvent was to increase the activity of C6F5B(OH)2 as a capping (cross-linking) Lewis-acidic
agent and to prevent it from undergoing a deborylation reaction. Besides,
the n-butylboron-capped analogues of such complexes
have been earlier described16 to form under
regular reaction conditions.

In the present study, n-butyl-, phenyl-, and pentafluorophenylboron-capped
iron and cobalt(II) tris-perfluoro-α-benzildioximates were synthesized
by Scheme 1 using the
template condensation of three molecules of α-dioxime with the
corresponding boronic acid on the metal(II) ion (Fe2+ or
Co2+) as a matrix. The reaction was performed under vigorous
reaction conditions (with boiling nitromethane or trifluoroacetic
acid used as the solvent and with distillation of a solvent–water
azeotrope), and the target iron and cobalt(II) clathrochelates were
isolated in moderate yields (25–55%).

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Iron
and Cobalt (Per)fluoroclathrochelates and Their
Precursors
The CV data (see
below) suggested the stability of the Co(I) intermediates
in the CV time scale, we attempted to obtain a chemically reduced
cobalt(I) clathrochelate using the synthetic approach described earlier.4 The reduction of Co((C6F5)2Gm)3(BC6H5)2 (3) by an excess of powder silver in the presence of
tetramethylammonium chloride (in combination with which the metallic
silver is known to form a strong reducing system16) in acetonitrile led to the formation of a dark-blue solution
with the intensive coloration caused by the clathrochelate anion [Co((C6F5)2Gm)3(BC6H5)2]−. This anion was isolated
as a salt with the bulky tetramethylammonium cation, a navy blue solid
product ((CH3)4N)[CoI((C6F5)2Gm)3(BC6H5)2] (7), that was air-stable for several
months but rapidly oxidized in a solution.

All the clathrochelates
obtained were then characterized by elemental
analysis, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, IR, UV–vis, CV, EPR, 1H, 13C, and 19F NMR spectroscopies,
and single crystal X-ray diffraction (for 3·CH2Cl2, 4, and 6·CH2Cl2).

UV–vis spectra of the obtained
tris-perfluoro-α-benzildioximate
iron and cobalt(II) clathrochelates contain, in their visible range,
two intensive bands assigned to a metal-to-ligand Md → Lπ*
charge transfer (MLCT). The bands in the spectra of the iron(II) complexes
are significantly shifted (by approximately 25 nm) in the UV range
and are more intensive (ε ≈ 1 ÷ 1.5 × 104 mol–1 L cm–1) than the
corresponding MLCT bands in the cobalt(II) complexes (ε ≈
5 × 103 mol–1 L cm–1). At the same time, they all are shortwave-shifted (by approximately
20 nm) as compared to those of their α-benzildioximate (i.e.
nonperfluorinated) analogues (Table S2 in the Supporting Information). The bands of π–π*
intraligand transitions in the UV–vis range for two types of
the cage complexes (i.e. the macrobicyclic metal(II) perfluoro- and
α-benzildioximates) are also shifted relative to each other,
thus showing a significant redistribution of the electron density
in the quasiaromatic cage framework as a result of the perfluorinated
ribbed substituents.

Reduction of the encapsulated cobalt(II)
ion is responsible for
the change in the color of the tris-perfluoro-α-benzildioximate
complexes from dark brown to navy blue (Figure 1). The same blue color, which has also been
observed for the cobalt(I) clathrochelates with nitrogen-containing
ligands,4,16 stems from two highly intensive bands that
appear at approximately 660 (ε = 6.6 × 103 mol–1 L cm–1) and 575 nm (ε = 3.0
× 103 mol–1 L cm–1) (Figure 1) and correspond
to the metal-to-ligand Cod → Lπ* backdonation and the
ligand-to-metal Lπ → Cod charge transfer. Upon reduction
of the encapsulated cobalt(II) ion to cobalt(I), these charge transfer
bands shift to the longwave region by 115–175 nm; by contrast,
the intraligand π–π* transition bands in the UV
region are slightly shortwave-shifted.

clathrochelate Co((C6F5)2Gm)3(BC6H5)2 (3,
in brown) and its reduced cobalt(I) derivative ((CH3)4N)+[CoI((C6F5)2Gm)3(BC6H5)2]− (7, in blue) at the
same concentrations.

IR spectra of all the obtained iron and cobalt(II) (per)fluoroclathrochelates
contain the N–O, B–O, and C=N stretching vibration
bands, which are characteristic of the boron-capped tris-dioximate
clathrochelates, and those of the C–F bonds characteristic
of their pentafluoroaryl-ribbed substituents.

In the MALDI-TOF
spectra of the cobalt(II) clathrochelate intracomplexes,
the peak of the molecular ion always dominates over those of its adducts
with the DHB matrix in their positive ranges. The spectrum of a cobalt(I)-encapsulating
ionic associate ((CH3)4N)[CoI((C6F5)2Gm)3(BC6H5)2] (7) contains in its negative range
(Figure S6) an intensive peak of the clathrochelate
anion at −1489 amu.

The number and position of the signals
in 1H, 19F{1H}, and 13C{1H} NMR spectra in
solution, together with the ratios of their integral intensities,
also confirmed the composition of the obtained iron and cobalt(II)
clathrochelates. Chemical shifts of the nuclei in the apical substituents
are similar to those in analogous butyl-,17 phenyl-,16 and perfluorophenyl-containing
clathrochelates7 with other ribbed substituents.
On the other hand, the chemical shifts of the nuclei in the ribbed
substituents are similar between the clathrochelates with other apical
substituents. Therefore, apical and ribbed substituents only slightly
affect the electronic environment of the nuclei of each other.

NMR spectra of the obtained cobalt(II) perfluorophenylclathrochelates
are typical for low-spin cobalt(II) cage complexes.17 Paramagnetic shifts of their nuclei compared to those in
the diamagnetic iron(II)-encapsulating analogues are relatively small
(below 2 ppm for protons and less than 4 ppm for 19F and 13C nuclei); the only exception is the ortho-carbon of the ribbed substituents. The latter is close to the encapsulated
paramagnetic metallocenter, the cobalt(II) ion, so it has a paramagnetic
shift of 45 ppm owing to the significant direct spin density delocalization
to its nucleus. Note that the signals of the ipso-carbon nuclei in 13C NMR spectra could not be observed
because of the paramagnetic broadening. In addition, a dynamic Jahn–Teller
exchange between three possible distorted molecular structures of
each complex at room temperature leads to partial averaging of both
the Fermi and dipolar contributions to the paramagnetic shifts.17

X-band EPR spectroscopy confirmed the
low-spin nature of the obtained
cobalt(II) clathrochelates; their spectra (Figure 2) contain a well-resolved eight-line splitting
in the downfield region caused by the hyperfine interaction with the 59Co nucleus (I = 7/2). Both g and hyperfine tensors are rhombic, and their values are characteristic
of the low-spin cobalt(II) clathrochelates.17 Note that high-spin cobalt(II) clathrochelates are EPR-silent in
the X-band as a result of a very large negative zero-field splitting.18

Figure 2 Experimental and simulated EPR spectra of 1 mM dichloromethane
solution of the cobalt(II) clathrochelate Co((C6F5)2Gm)3(BC6F5)2 (6, X-band, 80 K). The parameters of simulation are
as follows: gxx = 1.99, gyy = 2.10, gzz = 2.26, CoAxx = 145 MHz, CoAyy = 15 MHz, and CoAzz = 420 MHz.

No EPR signal was observed for the isolated cobalt(I)
perfluorophenyl
clathrochelate ((CH3)4N)+[CoI((C6F5)2Gm)3(BC6H5)2]− (7) in the X-band at 4 and 78 K, as typical for high-spin
cobalt(I) clathrochelates with large positive zero-field splitting,4,16 which makes them EPR-silent. The high-spin nature of Co(I) ion in
this complex is also consistent with the data from variable-temperature
dc magnetic susceptibility measurements (Figure 3): at 300 K, χMT is 1.16 cm3 K mol–1, which is only
slightly larger than the spin-only value for s =
1.

sample of ((CH3)4N)+[CoI((C6F5)2Gm)3(BC6H5)2]− (7) collected
under an applied dc field of 1 kOe.

The paramagnetic nature of [CoI((C6F5)2Gm)3(BC6H5)2]− species also follows
from
the NMR spectroscopy. Its NMR spectra 1H, 19F{1H}, and 13C{1H} are dominated
by the paramagnetic shifts, which are larger than in the above cobalt(II)
clathrochelates, as there is no dynamic Jahn–Teller distortion
in the cobalt(I) perfluorophenyl clathrochelate but it has a nonzero
pseudocontact contribution arising from its large zero-field splitting.
The alternation in the direction of the paramagnetic shifts, which
is observed for the nuclei of the ribbed fragments, also suggests
the significant contact contribution.

Note that the molecular
structures of the clathrochelates Co((C6F5)2Gm)3(BC6H5)2 (3), Co((C6F5)2Gm)3(Bn-C4H9)2 (4), and Co((C6F5)2Gm)3(BC6F5)2 (6)
were additionally confirmed by single crystal
X-ray diffraction (Figures 4–6, Table S3). According to its results, the Co–N
distances in these fluorinated cobalt(II) clathrochelates vary by
0.21 Å because of the Jahn–Teller distortion, so that
the metal ion is significantly shifted from the center of the “cage”
to one of the −N=C–C=N– ribbed
fragments. The CoN6-coordination polyhedron
in Co((C6F5)2Gm)3(BC6F5)2 (6) is close to the
trigonal prism (TP, Scheme 2; the distortion angle φ = 1.4°), whereas in the
other two (φ = 10°–14°), it adopts a geometry
that is intermediate between a TP (φ = 0°) and a trigonal
antiprism (TAP, φ = 60°). For comparison, the φ value
in the iron(II) complex Fe((C6F5)2Gm)3(Bn-C4H9)2 (1) is equal to 25.4°,6 and the metal ion is almost in the center of a cage framework.
The degree of this TAP–TP distortion is affected not only by
the nature of the metal ion but also by the nature of the ribbed substituents.
Thus, the coordination polyhedra in the nonperfluorinated cobalt(II)
tris-α-benzildioximates with the same apical groups (Bn-C4H917 and BC6H52a) are
closer to TAP (φ = 13.1° and 16.0°, respectively);
however, the φ value in the corresponding iron(II) n-butylboron-capped clathrochelate varies only a little if the phenyl
group is used instead of its ribbed perfluorophenyl (24.6°17). At the same time, perfluorination makes the
aryl ribbed substituents to rotate relative to the α-dioximate
fragments: average angles between their mean planes change from 55.7°
and 58.3° in Co((C6F5)2Gm)3(Bn-C4H9)2 (4) and Co((C6F5)2Gm)3(BC6H5)2 (3), respectively, to 45.8°17 and 46.7°2a in their α-benzildioximate analogs. In
Fe((C6F5)2Gm)3(Bn-C4H9)2 (1), the same angle is 58.9°,17 which
changes to 42.6° upon going to the corresponding α-benzildioximate
iron(II) complex.17 As a result of this
rotation, the mutual mesomeric effects of the perfluoroaryl substituents
and the quasiaromatic polyazomethine cage framework cancel out, so
that no π-conjugation between them is observed.

Scheme 2 TP–TAP Distortion of a MN6-Coordination
Polyhedron
In the absence of
X-ray diffraction data for the Co(I) complex
(as many attempts to grow its single crystals failed miserably), additional
confirmation for its formation comes from a comparative study of CoII((C6F5)2Gm)3(BC6H5)2 (3) and ((CH3)4N)[CoI((C6F5)2Gm)3(BC6H5)2] (7) by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (Figure 7). The spectrum for the CoI complex
is clearly shifted to a lower energy with respect to its CoII counterpart: the energy positions of the absorption maxima are 7727.3
and 7729.0 eV, respectively. This shift is especially apparent in
the derivative spectra (shown as an inset in Figure 7), which feature three distinct maxima at
7707.2, 7716.7, and 7721.9 eV for ((CH3)4N)[CoI((C6F5)2Gm)3(BC6H5)2] (7)
and at 7707.2, 7717.8, and 7723.7 eV for CoII((C6F5)2Gm)3(BC6H5)2 (3). Such a shift is consistent with the
formal reduction and the resultant decrease in the local electrostatic
potential at the cobalt nuclei in the CoI compound.

inset shows the first derivatives of the absorption coefficient.

FTs of the Co K-edge spectra for
the same two compounds are shown
in Figure 7. There
is a significant difference in the intensity and shape of the first
FT peak corresponding to the Co–N coordination sphere (Figure 8). In the case of
((CH3)4N)[CoI((C6F5)2Gm)3(BC6H5)2] (7), this peak is higher and shifted to longer
distances as compared to CoII((C6F5)2Gm)3(BC6H5)2 (3). To achieve a good fit for the latter compound,
it was necessary to assume the existence of four short (1.89 Å)
and two long (2.07 Å) Co–N bonds, that is, a 4 + 2 coordination
in a fair agreement with the direct X-ray diffraction data (see Table S3), demonstrating a strongly Jahn–Teller
distorted TP environment of the cobalt(II) ion. In the case of ((CH3)4N)[CoI((C6F5)2Gm)3(BC6H5)2] (7), a good fit is obtained with a single Co–N
distance of 1.97 Å and a coordination number of 6.

data and the open circles denote the best-fit theoretical curves.

Electrochemical properties of
the obtained iron and cobalt(II)
(per)fluoroclathrochelates were studied using CV. The corresponding
CVs contain a single cathodic wave in the potential range from 0 to
−1 V versus the Fc/Fc+ couple, which is assigned
to the Co2+/+ reduction. In all cases, this wave is reversible
(as follows from ΔEp = Ea – Ec being in the
range of 60–70 mV and from the current ratio for the direct
reduction and the reverse backward reoxidation processes equal to
one) and shows a diffusional control, as its peak current depends
linearly on the square root of the scan rate (Figure 9). Therefore, the anionic cobalt(I)-containing
species resulting from this metal-centered Co2+/+ reduction
are stable on the CV time scale. The reduction potential slightly
depends on the nature of the apical substituent in the cobalt clathrochelates.
An increase in its electron-withdrawing effect going from n-butyl to phenyl and to perfluorophenyl shifts the potential
to the anodic region from −0.415 to −0.314 and to −0.210
V (relative to the Fc/Fc+ redox couple), respectively.
Note that for the corresponding iron clathrochelates, the reduction
potentials are equal to −0.837, −0.749, and −0.691
V.

All the potentials are referenced to the Fc/Fc+ couple.

The electrocatalytic activity
in the HER was tested for all the
obtained iron and cobalt(II) clathrochelates using different organic
and inorganic acids (including acetic, trifluoroacetic, trifluoromethanesulfonic,
and perchloric acids) as a source of H+ ions. In contrast
to previously described clathrochelate-based electrocatalysts,2 the addition of acid to the acetonitrile solutions
of these complexes did not produce any electrocatalytic enhancement
of the current. Moreover, the addition of up to 5 equiv of acetic
or trifluoroacetic acids did not alter the CV response of the system;
full reversibility of the redox event remained even at scan rates
as low as 20 mV s–1 (Figure S1). In the presence of strong trifluoromethanesulfonic (Figure S2) and perchloric (Figure S3) acids, however, the reduction became irreversible,
again without any significant enhancement in the reduction current.
In the latter case, the addition of more than 2 equiv of the acid
caused an additional positively shifted oxidation peak to appear on
the reverse CV scan, suggesting the instability of the metal(I) complexes
in the solutions of very strong acids rather than any electrocatalytic
behavior. Indeed, further addition of these strong acids results in
the destruction of the original metal(II) complexes, as judging by
the loss of the color of their solutions. No electrocatalytic enhancement
of the current was observed after the acid-induced decomposition of
the metal(II) complexes. Even if electrocatalytically active metal
nanoparticles were formed in the process,3 they were also not stable in these harsh acidic conditions. The
bulk 30 min electrolysis performed for 1 mM acetonitrile solutions
of cobalt(II) clathrochelates in the presence of 5 equiv of trifluoroacetic
and trifluoromethanesulfonic acids showed no evolution of the molecular
hydrogen detected by gas chromatography. Note that in the case of
stronger trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, the solutions of cobalt(II)
clathrochelates lose their color in the very beginning of the experiment,
suggesting that under these harsh acidic conditions both electrochemically
generated cobalt(I) and parent cobalt(II) complexes are unstable.

To get insight into the stability of the cobalt(I) complex in less
acidic solutions, we employed NMR spectroscopy. The addition of up
to 3 equiv of trifluoroacetic acid to the acetonitrile-d3 solution of ((CH3)4N)[CoI((C6F5)2Gm)3(BC6H5)2] (7)
under anaerobic conditions did not result in noticeable changes in
both 1H and 19F NMR spectra even after 12 h.
Further increase in the concentration of the acid to 5 equiv led to
the fast transformation of the cobalt(I) complex into the parent cobalt(II)
clathrochelate (Figures S4 and S5).

No signal of molecular hydrogen was detected in the 1H
NMR spectra, suggesting the reduction of some other substrate.
Although a detailed investigation into the mechanism of the reaction
between the cobalt(I) complex and trifluoroacetic acid is out of scope
of the present study (as being irrelevant to the HER), the 1H NMR data hint on the possible reduction of the solvent under these
conditions: the signal at 6.0 ppm (Figure S5b) is characteristic of the NH4+ cation (the
splitting to three equal lines with the coupling constant of 53 Hz
is due to the interaction with the quadrupolar 14N nuclei),
which may be produced either from the initial clathrochelate or as
a result of the reduction of acetonitrile. While conducting the experiment
in a nitrogen-free dioxane-d8 solution,
no such signal was observed and the kinetics of CoI/CoII transition was much slower (full conversion in 8 h), thus
suggesting the latter mechanism.

Thus, despite the effective
stabilization of the metal(I)-encapsulating
reduced species by the perfluorophenyl ribbed substituents, the corresponding
iron and cobalt(II) clathrochelates are inactive in the electrocatalytic
HER. If the electrocatalysis is assumed to occur via the homogenous
mechanism,2 a possible reason for this
may be an almost complete isolation of the encapsulated metal ion
from the environment by bulky hydrophobic C6F5 substituents, which do not allow it to be protonated. At higher
concentrations of the acid, however, the protonation seems to take
place and to produce a dead-end complex, which is catalytically inactive
in the HER (although, apparently, on a longer time scale, it converts
back to the initial cobalt(II) compound with the reduction of some
other substrate). On the other hand, a very high stability of the
cobalt(I)-containing clathrochelate species may prevent their destruction
as long as the acidic conditions are not extremely harsh, so that
the electrocatalytically active metal nanoparticles3 can no longer form from them.

Conclusions
Although
the perfluorophenyl ribbed substituents in the iron and
cobalt(II) clathrochelates with different apical groups help stabilizing
the metal(I)-encapsulating reduced species, these complexes turned
out to be not electrocatalytically active in the HER. Such an unexpected
behavior may stem either from the encapsulated metallocenter being
well-isolated from the environment by the bulky hydrophobic perfluorinated
substituents or from the intermediate metal(I) species being effectively
stabilized by the caging ligands, which would make both the homogenous
and heterogenous electrocatalysis less probable. However, the electrochemical
reversibility of the reduction of all the complexes obtained offers
new opportunities for the isolation of other chemically stable metal(I)
clathrochelates; these studies are currently underway in our group.
