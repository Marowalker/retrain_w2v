A new
sustainable green protocol
for obtaining highly fluorogenic heterobioconjugates by a well-known
copper-mediated azide–alkyne cycloaddition click reaction of
nonfluorescent 3-azidocoumarins/benzyl azides (2a–f) and terminal alkynes (1a–e) using aqueous NaCl as a cheap and nontoxic salting-out agent under
ultrasonication at ambient temperature is described. The presence
of aqueous NaCl significantly influences the reaction by disturbing
the water kosmotropes and augments the hydrophobic interaction of
water-insoluble reactants, thus making the reaction feasible in water
at neutral pH. The “beauty” of the presented ecofriendly
approach is further boosted up by recycling the aqueous filtrate of
the reaction mixture without further addition of NaCl, CuSO4·5H2O, and Na ascorbate up to seven cycles, resulting
in effectively low copper loading (100 ppm) with excellent turn-over
number (4850) and turn-over frequency (88.18 min–1). A gram-scale synthesis was also successfully achieved with 92%
yield, further elaborating the scope of this methodology.

1 Introduction
The
azide–alkyne click reaction has attained great impetus
since its inception by Huisgen1 and further
made regioselective by Sharpless–Fokin’s2 and Meldal’s3 groups
using a Cu(I) catalyst. The copper-mediated 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition
reaction has become one of the most proficient coupling strategies
adopted for its bio-orthogonality, simplicity, efficiency, high reliability,
wide scope, and functional group tolerance, making it a reaction of
choice for biologists and chemists.4,5 Some recent
efforts have been made on the design of click reactions since they
have a broad spectrum
of applications in the emerging fields such as drug discovery,6,7 bioconjugation of molecules,8,9 chemical biology, and
materials science.10 Notably, myriads of
glycoprobes have shown potential to be used for in vitro and in vivo
tracking of target species.11 Apart from
these, fluorescent triazoles, generated using a sugar scaffold as
a core with different fluorophores12−15 as chemical reporters, viz.,
coumarin, anthracene, and 1,8-naphthalimide
(high emission yield), are nowadays used in biosensing, biolabeling,
and bioimaging and also as chemosensors.16 A triazole ring can not only serve as a linker but also actively
participate in hydrogen bonding to bind biomolecules or serve as an
ion coordination site17,18 for selective detection of ions,15 biomolecules, and small molecules.19

Traditionally, the copper-mediated azide–alkyne
cycloaddition
(CuAAC) reaction is carried out in a mixture of water and water-miscible
organic solvents such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), tetrahydrofuran,
and tBuOH.20 In this context, many efforts have been made to modify CuAAC using
100% aqueous (aq) media21−34 and Cu-binding ligands such as polysaccharide-supported nanoparticles,35 N-heterocyclic carbenes,36 polynitrogen ligands,37,38 urea,39 and tri(aminoalkyl)amine.40 However, these strategies have some inherent drawbacks,
including relatively sluggish synthetic routes, high copper and ligand
loading, high temperature, long reaction time, and use of organic
solvents.39 Consequently, there is still
a demand for the development of new efficient, highly economical,
widely applicable, commercially feasible, and environmentally sustainable
routes for obtaining 1,2,3-triazoles, which can be performed with
low copper loading to meet their growing demand in various applications.

In recent years, water as a medium for organic synthesis is in
high demand because it is cheap, nontoxic, ecofriendly, and abundant.41 Furthermore, its unique structure and physiochemical
properties such as polarity, hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic effect,
and trans-phase
reactions lead to interactions that influence the reaction.42 Since water molecules have low magnitude of
hydrophobhic interaction and cannot form hydrogen bonding with hydrocarbons,
they form a cage- or clathrate-like structure around hydrocarbons
called kosmotropes. These kosmotropes capture the hydrophobic reactant
molecules inside the cavity and thus decrease the interaction of reactant
molecules.43−45 Therefore, the reaction cannot be carried out in
water alone. Compounds like NaCl act as a “salting-out”
agent, which increases the hydrophobic effect and thus disturbs the
kosmotropes by increasing the cavity formation energy cost in aqueous
solution.46−50 When such salts are dissolved in water, molecules of water collapse
around their ions to solvate them via a process known as ionic hydration.
Thus, there is less empty space for hydrocarbon solutes and the energy
cost for cavitation to produce a hydrocarbon-sized hole in the solvent
is high. As a result, they provide more space to the hydrophobic reactant
molecules and the desired product is formed in excellent yield.51

Inspired by recent reports on bio-orthogonal
chemistry exploiting
weakly or nonfluorescent reagents to produce highly fluorescent molecules,
which could be exploited for tagging of biomolecules in living systems,
especially in aqueous medium,52−57 and in continuation to our previous work on fluorescent coumarin-based
compounds,58−62 herein, we describe a green protocol for the preparation of heterobioconjugate-based
1,4-disubsituted 1,2,3-traizoles through a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition
reaction using NaCl as a salting-out agent in water under ultrasonic
irradiation at ambient temperature. Additional advantage of this protocol
is recycling of the traditional Cu(I) catalytic system up to seven
cycles, which enhances the viability of this method by reducing the
loading of toxic Cu. The importance of NaCl is because it is a low-cost,
harmless, and most accessible
salting-out agent. This saline-mediated bioconjugation reaction represents
the most biofriendly, mild, and versatile approach for conjugating
sensitive biomolecules without the need for any extensive purification
steps, which describes the overall sustainability of the process.63 Till now, to the best of our understanding,
there is no report available related to the synthesis of heterobioconjugate-based
triazoles using sodium chloride as a salting-out agent. A number of
derivatives have been synthesized, which projects the versatility
of this process, and gram-scale synthesis depicting the commercial
scope has also been successfully accomplished with almost quantitative
yield of desired products.

2 Results and Discussion
Initially, a logical experimental design was visualized for optimizing
the various reaction parameters to achieve high atom economy as well
as to make the reaction sustainable and ecofriendly by taking 3-azidocoumarin
(2a) (1 mmol) and peracetylated sugar alkyne (1a) (1.1 mmol) as model substrates (Scheme 1). To validate our approach, a number of
trial runs were conducted by varying only one parameter (copper loading,
solvent, temperature, or salting-out agent) at a time and
keeping all others constant. We initiated our study by performing
the click reaction with model substrates following the conventional
route whereby a mixture of CuSO4·5H2O (10
mol %) and Na ascorbate (20 mol %) in tBuOH–water (1:2 ratio) was stirred for 5 h at 70 °C,
resulting in 78% yield of the
product. The ultrasonic wave-assisted reaction proceeds by an acoustic
cavitation phenomenon, which includes formation, growth, and collapse
of bubbles in liquid media, creating high local temperature and pressure,
which lead to increased rate of reaction.64,65 Considering the synthetic utility of ultrasound, the same reaction
was repeated under identical conditions, except that stirring was
replaced by ultrasonication. This resulted in 88% isolated yield in
2 h at 50 °C. To avoid the use of harmful organic solvents, the
reaction was next performed solely in aqueous media at above-mentioned
reaction conditions at 50 °C under ultrasonication, and no product
was formed even after 24 h. However, at high temperature (80 °C),
less than 30% yield was obtained in 24 h (Table 1, entry 1). This may be due to the formation
of water kosmotropes (hydrogen-bonded clathrate), which surround the
hydrophobic organic reactants, decreasing the interaction between
reactants (Figure 1). A perusal of literature44,45,66 revealed that when ionic species like NaCl, KCl, NaBr, CH3COONa, NH4Cl, Na2SO4, MgSO4, etc. are dissolved in water, they strongly interact with water
molecules and perturb the kosmotropes, and hence breaking the water
cage and creating more space for reaction to proceed via enforced
hydrophobic interactions to furnish the desired product in almost
quantitative yield.

a Reagents and conditions: peracetylated
glucose alkyne (1a) (1.1 mmol), coumarin azide (2a) (1 mmol), salting-out agent in aqueous medium was ultrasonicated
in open air at 40 °C for 55 min.

b Isolated yield of product.

c Reaction proceeded at high temperature
(80 °C) for 24 h.

To
validate this theory, various salting-out agents (10 mol %)
were then tested for the model reaction in the presence of CuSO4·5H2O (1 mol %) and Na ascorbate (5 mol %)
in water at 40 °C temperature to give the corresponding triazole
(Table 1, entries 3–9).
It is obvious from Table 1 that NaCl serves as the best salting-out reagent among them
with 97% isolated yield and 100% conversion in 55 min (Table 1, entry 3). The next step was
to determine the lowest mol % requirement of NaCl, so 5, 10, and 15
mol % NaCl were tested (Table 1, entries 10–12) keeping all of the other parameters
constant. The best yield was obtained using 10 mol % NaCl (Table 1, entry 11), and further
enhancement of NaCl loading does not affect the yield% of the desired
product (Table 1, entry
12). Thus, 10 mol % NaCl was selected as the optimum amount for synthesizing
all other derivatives.

Although it is well established that
Cu(I) is essential for the
regioselective success of click reaction, to eliminate any doubt,
the model reaction was carried out in the absence of Cu(I), which
yielded no product even after 24 h (Table 1, entry 2). The results implied that both
copper and NaCl play an important role to favor the reaction effectively
in the forward direction in water. All of the reactions were performed
in open air without formation of any side products.

Another
variant was temperature, which was optimized by performing
parallel model reactions by simple stirring as well as under ultrasonication
at different temperatures (30, 40, 50, 60 °C). Best results were
obtained using ultrasonic irradiation at 40 °C in 55 min rather
than simple stirring (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Effect of temperature on the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction.

To find the minimum effective
concentration of the Cu catalyst
required for catalyzing the CuAAC reaction, different concentrations
of CuSO4·5H2O were tried (1000, 500, 200,
100, 50, 25 ppm) for the model reaction in water at 40 °C. When
the reaction was performed with 1000, 500, 200, and 100 ppm Cu, conversion
after 55 min was 100% and the desired product was obtained in 97%
yield (Table 2, entries
4–7). When the copper concentration was further reduced to
50 and 25 ppm, the yield decreased (Table 2, entries 8–9). The best conditions
for this click reaction are at 100 ppm and 40 °C for 55 min under
ultrasonication, leading to complete conversions and high isolated
yields.

a Reactions were carried out with
peracetylated glucose alkyne (1a) (1.1 mmol), coumarin
azide (2a) (1 mmol), CuSO4·5H2O (1000–25 ppm), and Na ascorbate (5 mol %), and 3 mL of aq
solution of salting-out agent in water (3 mL) was ultrasonicated in
open air at ambient temperature for 55 min.

b The catalyst was recycled seven
times under these conditions.

c Isolated yield after column chromatography.

d 100% conversion with 97% isolated
yield was observed after 80 min.

Since it is well known that the coumarin moiety produces fluorescence,
after substitution with an e–-withdrawing azide
group (−N3) at
third position, the fluorescence gets quenched and can be restored
by the formation of a triazole ring due to extension of conjugation.67 Keeping this in mind, it was decided to investigate
the progress of model reaction using fluorescence spectroscopy. Figure 3 shows that the fluorescence
intensity increases with time, indicating that the reaction proceeds
in the forward direction and gets completed in 55 min.

Figure 3 Progress of the model
reaction using fluorescence spectroscopy.

Catalytic performance in which toxic copper salts are involved
is another aspect of concern from environmental point of view, which
can be sorted out by recycling of the catalyst. Since CuSO4·5H2O, NaCl, and Na ascorbate are all soluble in
water, it was thought worthwhile to recycle the aqueous filtrate as
such without further addition of these reagents in subsequent cycles.
This theory led to positive results (Figure 4c) up to seven runs, thereby reducing the
effective copper loading per cycle. A slight decrease in % yield of
desired products may be due to loss of Cu(I) in aqueous medium during
the workup process.

Figure 4 (a) Images of the recycled Cu(I)–NaCl catalytic
system during consecutive
seven cycles, (b) UV–visible graph of the recycled Cu(I)–NaCl
catalytic system, (c) reusability of the Cu(I)–NaCl catalytic
system up to seven cycles for the model reaction.

This fact was also verified by recording UV–vis spectra
of aqueous solution of CuSO4·5H2O, which
show absorption in the range of 700–800 nm (Figure 4a, inset), ascribed to the
Cu2+ d–d transition.68 After coordination of Cu2+ to the ligand, this absorption
vanishes and further reduction exhibits a band in the range of 300–400
nm (absorption at 300 nm, Figure 4b), which is attributed to a metal-to-ligand charge
transfer transition.69 The blue color of
CuSO4·5H2O aqueous solution changes to
green after reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I), which further lightens during
recycling of the Cu(I)–NaCl catalytic system (Figure 4a). It may be inferred from
these results that this work can be extended for fluorogenic bioligation
with low loading of toxic copper salts.

To broaden the scope
of this reaction, different derivatives (electron-donating
and -withdrawing groups) of azides (2a–f) and different alkynes (1a–e) were
investigated under the optimized reaction conditions. Table 3 shows that this method has
good compatibility and functional group tolerance to afford corresponding
triazoles (3aa–ae, 3ba–be, 3ca, 3df, 3cf) in excellent yields. Furthermore, to widen the scope
of the present study, a reaction in which unprotected sugar alkyne
was reacted with 3-azidocoumarin under the same reaction conditions
afforded 94% yield
in 55 min when NaCl is used as the additive; however in the absence
of NaCl, only 43% isolated yield was obtained (Table S1). It may be noted that 30% yield is obtained with
peracetylated sugar alkyne (Table 1, entry 1). This observation may be attributed to the
water solubility of reactants. All of the synthesized triazoles (3aa–ae, 3ba–be) were shown to be in the β-anomeric form, as evidenced
by a wide doublet for sugar H-1 (δ 4.6 ppm).

2.1 Absorbance and Fluorescence Analyses of 1,4-Disubsituted
Triazoles (3aa–ae, 3ba–be)
The absorption spectra
of coumarin triazoles (3aa–ae, 3ba–be) (1 × 10–5 M in DMSO solution) show the absorption band at around 305–370
nm (Figure 5a). Absorption
at around 300 nm is due to the π–π* transition,
which arises from the extension of conjugation by triazole ring formation.
A bathochromic shift in absorption is observed in the case of 6-bromo
(3ac, 3bc), 7-hydroxy (3ab, 3bb), 5,6-benzo (3ad, 3bd), and
8-methoxy (3ae, 3be) substituted triazoles,
which is observed at around 330–370 nm, consistent with previous
reports. The bands at 420 and 440 nm in 7-hydroxy (3ac, 3bc) and 8-methoxy (3ae, 3be) derivatives, respectively, is assigned to the n−π*
transition. Triazole 3ca shows absorption at 325 nm (π–π*)
and 420 nm (n−π*) and emission at 405 nm in aqueous media
with a quantum yield (QY) of 14% (Figure S3).

Figure 5 (a) Absorption and (b) emission spectra of triazoles (3aa–ae, 3ba–be)
(1 × 10–5 M in DMSO).

It can be concluded that the absorption bands of triazoles
are
dependent on bromo, methoxy, benzo, and hydroxy substituents in coumarin
scaffolds. A small change is observed in the absorbance of triazoles
by changing the sugar moiety, indicating its negligible influence
on the position
of absorption band.

Coumarin azide derivatives (2a–e) are nonfluorescent due to the presence of
three electron-rich nitrogen
atoms at the third position.67 After clicking
of sugar terminal alkynes (1a–b, d) with 3-azidocoumarin derivatives (2a–e), the obtained triazoles (3aa–ae, 3ba–be) switched on to
fluorescence due to extension of conjugation through the five-membered
triazole ring.71 Fluorescence spectra of 3aa–ad are shown in Figure 5b. It is observed that the fluorescence intensity
and position vary by the presence of certain functional groups at
the strategic position in the coumarin scaffold. The excitation of
triazoles 3ab and 3bb (containing the −OH
functional group at the seventh position on the coumarin moiety) at
345 nm produces a strong emission band with maximum intensity centered
at 430 nm with a quantum yield of 33% (Table 4) due to the expansion of conjugation by
increasing its e– density. 8-Methoxy (3ae, 3be) and benzo (3ad, 3bd) groups containing triazoles show emission bands at 410 and 420
nm, respectively. In contrast, triazole 3ac contains
a 6-Br group, which produces a weak emission band at 428 nm upon excitation
at 327 nm with a low quantum yield of 3% due to first the electron-withdrawing
nature of bromine, which decreases the expansion of conjugation, and
second its heavy atom effect.72 The quantum
yield of triazoles was determined using quinine sulfate73 as the standard sample and was calculated according
to the following equation  where Q is the quantum yield, I is the measured integrated emission intensity, ∩
is the refractive index of the solvent (1.47 DMSO), and A is the optical density. The subscript “r” refers to
the reference standard with known QY.74 The quantum yield of quinine sulfate is 0.54.

The catalytic activity of the
Cu(I)–NaCl system was compared
to that from other
reported methods. It is amply clear from the comparative Table S1 (Supporting Information) that these
reported methods suffer some drawbacks such as requirements of high
catalyst and cocatalyst loading, organic solvents, high temperature,
and longer reaction time. On the other hand, the present methodology
is more adaptable and efficient, which involves short reaction time,
ambient temperature, high product yield, low copper loading, and use
of water as a green medium to furnish regioselective synthesis of
triazoles.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion,
we have demonstrated a simple and versatile protocol
for regioselective synthesis of a variety of fluorogenic 1, 4-disubsituted
triazoles with high quantum yield from coumarin azide and peracetylated
sugar terminal alkyne using NaCl as a salting-out agent. NaCl plays
a key role and enforced hydrophobicity of water for the reaction.
These interactions disturb the arrangement of kosmotropes in water,
generate sufficient ambience for reactants, and give desired products
in excellent yield. The advantage of the presented ecofriendly approach
is recycling of the aqueous filtrate of the reaction mixture without
further addition of NaCl, CuSO4·5H2O, and
Na ascorbate up to seven cycles, resulting in effectively low copper
loading (high turn-over number (TON) and turn-over frequency (TOF)).
It is believed that these benign reaction conditions will pave new
pathways for multicomponent hydrophobic reactions to take place in
aqueous media and have a broad spectrum impact on biological and material
sciences as NaCl is a cheap, commercially available, and biocompatible
reagent. Furthermore, this reaction sequence will be useful in live
cell imaging since both sugar alkyne and coumarin azide are bio-orthogonal;
therefore, this novel aqueous strategy operating at neutral pH marks
a new era for bioligation and bioimaging applications for which ambient
temperature is a necessity.

4.1 Material and Methods
4.1.1 Instruments
Melting points were
determined in open glass capillaries and were reported uncorrected. 1H NMR was recorded on a Jeol ECS, 400 MHz, using CDCl3 as the solvent. Tetramethylsilane was taken as an internal
standard, and the chemical shifts were recorded in δ ppm. Resonance
multiplicities were described as s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet),
q (quartet), and m (multiplet). IR spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer
Spectrum Two spectrometer using KBr pellet. Mass spectra were recorded
on a Xevo G2-S Q-Tof mass spectrometer (Waters), capable of recording
high-resolution mass spectrum (HRMS) in the electrospray ionization
(ESI) mode. An Elma S 70 H ultrasonic unit with 37 kHz output frequency
was employed for ultrasonication. UV–visible spectra and fluorescence
spectra were recorded on Shimadzu UV-1800 in standard 3.5 mL quartz
cells with 10 mm path length and FluoroMax 4 C.L. system, respectively.

4.1.2 Typical Procedure for the Synthesis of 1,4-Disubsituted
1,2,3-Triazoles (3aa–ae, 3ba–be, 3cf)
A mixture
of 3-azidocoumarin (1 mmol, 0.1871 g), peracetylated sugar terminal
alkyne (1.1 mmol, 0.4633 g), CuSO4·5H2O
(100 ppm), and sodium ascorbate (5 mol %, 0.0099 g) in H2O (3.0 mL) was ultrasonicated for 1 min, and after that, aqueous
solution of 10 mol % NaCl (0.0058 g in 3 mL water) was added into
it. Furthermore, the resultant mixture was ultrasonicated for the
time mentioned in Table 1 at ambient temperature (40 °C). Progress of reaction was monitored
by thin-layer chromatography (TLC), under UV light, and by fluorescence
spectroscopy. After completion of the reaction, the resultant mixture
was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 10 mL) and the combined
organic layer was washed with brine (20 mL), dried over Na2SO4, and concentrated under reduced pressure. Removal
of the solvent yielded a residue, which was purified by flash column
chromatography over silica gel (80–200 mesh) and eluted with
EtOAc/n-hexane (1:3) to furnish the desired pure
white products.

(6 mmol, 1.134 g), peracetylated sugar terminal alkyne (7.2 mmol,
2.7799 g), copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate (600 ppm), and sodium ascorbate
(5 mol %, 0.0594 g) was ultrasonicated for 1 min, and after that,
aqueous solution of 10 mol % NaCl (0.0348 g) was added into it. Furthermore,
the reaction mixture was ultrasonicated at 40 °C until the completion
of reaction (TLC; EtOAc/n-hexane (1:3)). The resulting
reaction mixture was filtered, washed many times with water, and then
dried. The product was obtained as a white solid with 92% isolated
yield.
