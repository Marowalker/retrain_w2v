Stimuli-controlled
structural transitions of nucleic acids have
received growing attentions owing to their potential applications
in the fields of chemical and synthetic biology. Here, we describe
the development of reduction-responsive deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
duplexes, in which guanine rings bearing a reduction-responsive cleavable
nitrobenzyl (NB) group at the O6 position
(GNB) are introduced at defined positions. We demonstrate
that the artificial NB group can be removed in response to reduction
stimulus without the dissociation of the intermolecular duplex structure,
which comprises a G-quadruplex forming nucleic acid strand with one
GNB and its complementary sequence with one mismatch pair.
Meanwhile, another duplex that comprised a G-quadruplex forming nucleic
acid strand with two GNB and its complementary sequence
with three mismatch pairs exhibited reduction-responsive structural
transitions from intermolecular duplex to intramolecular quadruplex.
These findings might be useful for the development of DNA architectures
endowed with reduction-responsive functions.

Introduction
Stimuli-responsive
biomolecules, including nucleic acids, have
attracted growing attention because of the possibility to control
their functions and processes in biological environments. To this
end, photocaged biomolecules have been explored for decades.1 When introducing photoremovable chemical groups
into a target biomolecule, the activities of that biomolecule can
be temporarily masked; then, they can be restored by an external stimulus,
i.e., photoirradiation, to remove the chemical groups introduced.
Moreover, recent progress and deeper understanding of bio-orthogonal
chemical reactions have extended the scope of the stimuli: stimuli-triggered
release of active biomolecules (decaging) is no longer limited to
photostimuli.2 Some recent interesting
examples are the inverse-demand Diels–Alder reaction-triggered
decaging to release active proteins, in which tetrazine derivatives
can be used as a trigger for the decaging, as described by Chen et
al.3 In addition, Deiters et al. reported
a phosphine-mediated Staudinger reduction capable of activating proteins,
which are caged via an azido-functionalized amino acid.4 In those works, xenobiotic, but not seriously
toxic, small molecules can trigger the selective decaging to restore
active proteins even in living cells. In addition, endogenous compounds,
such as reactive oxygen species (e.g., hydrogen peroxide), can be
employed to induce the decaging of proteins with phenylboronic acid
derivatives.5 Considering these seminal
works on proteins and their progress, chemically caged nucleic acids
are not yet sufficiently explored.

Nucleic acids hold inherently
important biological activities,
for example, even short strands produce RNA interference (RNAi).6 Moreover, artificially designed or explored functional
nucleic acids, such as decoy deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA),7 aptamers,8 ribozymes,9 and DNAzymes,10 have
been actively investigated. Stimuli-responsive control over the structure
of nucleic acids would thus set the basis for several bioapplications.
Moreover, photocaged nucleic acids have been explored and utilized
as tools for biological research, such as light control of transcription,
aptamers, antisense activity, and RNAi.1,11 However, examples
of chemically caged nucleic acids and their applications as well as
the understanding of their behavior are still rather limited compared
to the recent substantial progress on stimuli-responsive proteins.
The pioneering work of Micura et al. developed RNAs that contain one
or two O6-trichloroethyl-modified guanines
(GTCE) in their sequences. They are capable of exhibiting
zinc-responsive transition in their folding structures accompanied
with the recovery of guanine by the removal of the trichloroethyl
groups.12 Recently, Saneyoshi and Ono et
al. developed a O4-(4-nitrobenzyl)-modified
thymine (TNB) and investigated the hypoxia(bioreduction)-responsive
properties of oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) bearing it.13a Also, very recently, Morihiro and Obika et
al. developed nucleobases bearing 4-boronobenzyl group (NBB) and introduced O4-(4-boronobenzyl)-modified
thymine into antisense ODNs for hydrogen peroxide-triggered gene silencing.13b Not only nucleobases but also other moieties
of the nucleic acids, e.g., phosphate diester14 and ribose,15 have been target sites
for modification with chemically caged groups.16

In view of the fact that the guanine exhibits unique
structural
polymorphs, such as G-quartet, compared with other nucleobases, we
previously developed a reduction-responsive guanine (GNB, Figure 1A) bearing
a nitrobenzyl (NB) group at the O6 position17 and introduced it into the 5′-end of
a G-quadruplex forming DNA (15-mer, 5′-GGTTGGTGTGGTTGG-3′),
which is known as thrombin-binding aptamer (TBA).8b In our previous study,17 we demonstrated that tertiary structural transition from random
coil to intramolecular G-quadruplex (both are single-stranded structures)
can be triggered by chemical and enzymatic reductions to convert GNB to G (Figure 1B). Such a stimuli-controlled transition of oligonucleotide tertiary
structures might be useful for OFF–ON switching of their functions.
Recently, reduction-responsive biomolecules as well as self-assembled
nanomaterials have been attracting increasing attention mostly for
cancer-related hypoxia investigations.18 Conversely, the experience on the selection of aptamers revealed
that a significant proportion of DNA aptamers adopt G-quadruplex structures.19 In addition, polymorphic G-quadruplex structures
are involved in telomere DNA structures and their corresponding biological
activity.20 Therefore, stimuli-controlled
formation of the G-quadruplex structures might provide potential opportunity
to explore OFF–ON switching of target-binding functions or
transcription regulation. In this study, we describe the reduction-responsive
behavior of intermolecular duplexes, comprising TBAs
with one or two GNB and their complementary sequences with
a specific number of mismatches. TBA(8b) was selected as typical and functional G-quadruplex. Also,
the relatively short length of TBA might be suitable
for inducing duplex dissociation in response to a desired stimulus.
In particular, we present a sequence design to enable the reduction
stimuli-triggered dissociation of such intermolecular duplex to simultaneously
release intramolecular TBA G-quadruplex (Figure 1C).

Results and Discussion
Sequence Design of Reduction-Responsive
G-Quadruplex Forming
DNAs Containing One or Two GNB
In this study,
we prepared two TBAs (15-mer) containing GNB: TBA5NB (5′-GGTTGNBGTGTGGTTGG-3′, superscript
before NB in “TBA5NB” is the position from the 5′-end) and TBA(5,8)NB2 (5′-GGTTGNBGTGNBTGGTTGG-3′),
according to the previously reported method (see Supporting Information).17 According
to the pioneer studies by Mayer et al., where a photocaged G is incorporated
into TBA to destabilize or inhibit the formation of the
G-quadruplex structure, at least one G from the eight involved in
the quadruplex formation has to be replaced with the photocaged G;
that is a G at positions 1, 2, 5, 6, 10, 11, 14, or 15 in the sequence
shown above.22 In our previous study, we
incorporated a GNB at position 1 (i.e., 5′-end),
which enabled almost complete inhibition of the G-quadruplex formation
and thus led to the development of a reduction-responsive G-quadruplex
forming DNA (TBA1NB), as shown
in Figure 1B. In this
study, G was replaced with GNB at position 5 (near the
center of the sequence), which is expected to have a substantial effect
on the thermodynamic stability of duplexes comprising TBAs with GNB and their nearly complementary strands. The
incapability of both TBA5NB and TBA(5,8)NB2 to form a G-quadruplex
structure and the reduction stimulus-induced formation of a TBA G-quadruplex were evident from circular dichroism (CD)
spectroscopic measurements, which are similar to those of TBA1NB (Figure S6).17

Duplex Formation: TBA with One GNB +
Its Nearly Complementary Sequences
To understand the influence
of GNB on the thermodynamic stability of the duplex (Figure 2A), melting temperatures
(Tm) were measured by means of an ultraviolet
(UV) absorption spectroscopy for the nearly complementary sequences
5′-GGTTXGTGTGGTTGG-3′ (X = GNB, TBA5NB) and 3′-CCAAYCACACCAACC-5′ (CS5Y, superscript is the position from the 3′-end). Different
bases were incorporated at position Y (A or T or G or
C) to give a series of TBA5NB·CS5Y (GNB:Y)
duplexes.
As summarized in Figure 2B, the following Tm hierarchy was observed
in the order of decreasing stability: GNB:G > GNB:C > GNB:T > GNB:A.23 The four TBA5NB·CS5Y (GNB:Y = A or T or
G or C) duplexes evidently showed lower thermodynamic stability compared
to the perfectly matched native TBA·CS5C (G:C) duplex (Tm = 65.0 °C). Nonetheless, TBA5NB·CS5G duplex (GNB:G, Tm = 59.1 °C), which
was the most stable among the four duplexes investigated, was thermodynamically
more stable than TBA·CS5G duplex (G:G, Tm = 55.0 °C)
by 4.1 °C (ΔTm: difference
in thermodynamic stability between duplexes with or without NB group).24 This implies that duplexes bearing a GNB:G pair become unstable after the removal of the NB group, which
might be promising to induce duplex dissociation in response to a
reduction stimulus. The study was thus focused on the GNB:G pair.

gray line: 75 °C) and CD spectrum of TBA·CS5C duplex (red line). (D) Representative
thermal CD (270 nm, blue squares for TBA5NB·CS5G duplex) and
UV (260 nm, blue circles for TBA5NB·CS5G, red circles
for TBA·CS5G duplex) melting curves. Conditions: TBA5NB·CS5Y duplex (10
μM) and TBA (10 μM), 50 mM phosphate buffer
(pH 7.6) with 100 mM KCl for (B) and 100 mM N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) (pH 7.0) buffer with
0.1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) and 105 mM KCl for (C, D),
and 0.1 cm cell length.

The CD spectrum of TBA5NB·CS5G duplex before thermal
melting
exhibited positive signals centered at 270 nm and negative signals
at 240 nm, which can be compared to that of perfectly matched native TBA·CS5C duplex
(Figure 2C). The observed
small deviation (i.e., enhanced positive CD intensity at ∼280
nm for TBA5NB·CS5G duplex compared to TBA·CS duplex) suggests a contribution of the NB group under the
chiral environment of a double-stranded helical structure because
NB has an absorption band at ∼280 nm.17 CD spectral changes during the thermal melting of TBA5NB·CS5G duplex were characteristic for the double-stranded helical
structure of ODNs (a red shift of the zero-crossing wavelength from
257 to 260 nm and a decrease in the intensity of CD signals, Figure 2C). Moreover, both
the UV and CD thermal melting experiments of TBA5NB·CS5G duplex gave similar melting curves, as shown in Figure 2D. Also, almost no hysteresis
was observed (Figure S4), indicating fast
hybridization kinetics of the duplex. Overall, although the exact
structure of the TBA5NB·CS5G duplex, i.e., the location or
dynamics of NB in the double-stranded helical structure, remains elusive
and requires further studies, these results suggest that TBA5NB·CS5G duplex can adopt the standard double-stranded helical structure
(most probably a B-form conformation) without significant structural
perturbations.

Reduction Stimuli-Responsive Properties of TBA5NB·CS5G Duplex with One GNB:G Pair: Reduction-Responsive
Duplex
Exhibiting No Dissociation
From thermal denaturation experiments
with CD spectroscopy under the Tm measurement
conditions similar to the duplexes (Figure S5), the Tm of intramolecular G-quadruplex
structure of TBA was evaluated as 51.0 °C (Figure 2B, similar to the
reported value25). Therefore, the thermodynamic
stability of the related intermolecular duplexes bearing one GNB:G pair and the intramolecular TBA G-quadruplex
is TBA5NB·CS5G duplex (Tm = 59.1 °C) > TBA·CS5G duplex (Tm = 55.0 °C)
> TBA G-quadruplex (Tm =
51.0 °C). This indicates that TBA·CS5G, which was obtained after the reduction-triggered
removal of NB from TBA5NB·CS5G, is more stable than the intramolecular TBA G-quadruplex structure.

To investigate the reduction-responsive
conformational change of TBA5NB·CS5G duplex, Na2S2O4 was employed as reductant to induce the
removal of NB. As shown in Figure 3A, only a small change was observed in the CD spectra
of the TBA5NB·CS5G duplex, even after addition of a sufficient
amount of Na2S2O4 that was determined
in our previous study to allow for almost quantitative removal of
the NB group. Furthermore, as shown in Figure 3B, the conversion from TBA5NB (tR = 13.7 min)
to TBA (tR = 11.6 min) after
the addition of Na2S2O4 was confirmed
by ion-pair reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography
(IP RP HPLC) analyses as well as mass spectra (MS, data not shown).
The peaks in the chromatogram were assigned using authentic samples
as references or were based on the mass spectra (tR = 11.3 min for CS5G). Conversely, in the absence of CS5G, single-stranded TBA5NB showed a sharp increase in the CD signal at 290 nm after the addition
of Na2S2O4 under similar conditions
(vide supra, Figure S6), which indicates
the reduction-responsive folding of TBA5NB to form the TBA G-quadruplex. These results suggest
that the reduction-triggered removal of NB from the TBA5NB·CS5G duplex yielded mostly the TBA·CS5G duplex with neither duplex dissociation
nor TBA G-quadruplex formation (Figure 3C).

Reduction Stimuli-Responsive Properties of
the TBA(5,8)NB2·CS(5,8)G7T Duplex with Two GNB:G
Pairs: Transition from Intermolecular
Duplex to Intramolecular Quadruplex
To induce the intermolecular
duplex dissociation after reduction-triggered removal of NB and simultaneous
intramolecular quadruplex folding (reduction-induced transition from
duplex to quadruplex), the minimum requirements would be as follows:
(i) the initial sequences of a duplex containing GNB should
possess enough thermodynamic stability to maintain intermolecular
duplex structure at a given temperature and (ii) thermodynamic stability
of the duplex after the removal of NB should become at least lower
than that of the intramolecular TBA G-quadruplex, hopefully,
below the designated temperature. To satisfy these criteria and based
on the results mentioned above, the number of GNB:G pairs
was increased in the initial sequence of the intermolecular duplex.
In particular, the G at position 8 in the TBA sequence
in addition to G at position 5 was replaced with GNB to
obtain TBA(5,8)NB2. Furthermore,
based on calculations with the DINAMelt software,27 one additional mismatch T:T pair was carefully introduced
in the middle of the sequence (position 7 from the 5′-end of TBA) to modulate the thermodynamic stability of the duplex;
i.e., to decrease the stability of the duplex after removal of NB
while maintaining the stability of the initial duplex at a given temperature.
Thereby, the TBA(5,8)NB2·CS(5,8)G7T duplex was constructed
(TBA(5,8)NB2: 5′-GGTTGNBGTGNBTGGTTGG-3′; CS(5,8)G7T: 3′-CCAAGCTGACCAACC-5′).

From thermal UV denaturation experiments, Tm of the TBA(5,8)NB2·CS(5,8)G7T duplex was evaluated to
be 40.8 °C (Figure 4A). In addition, TBA(5,8)NB2·CS(5,8)G7T duplex showed
a CD spectrum similar to that of the perfectly matched native TBA·CS duplex, and the CD melting curve
was comparable to the UV melting curve (Figure 4B). Moreover, almost no hysteresis was observed
as in the case of TBA5NB·CS5G duplex (Figure S4). These results suggest that the TBA(5,8)NB2·CS(5,8)G7T duplex can also adopt the standard double-stranded helical
structure. Notably, Tm of TBA·CS(5,8)G7T duplex, which
should be obtained after the removal of NB from the TBA(5,8)NB2·CS(5,8)G7T duplex, was evaluated to be 27.9 °C according to the
UV melting curve (Figure 4B). The large difference in the thermal stability of TBA(5,8)NB2·CS(5,8)G7T duplex before and after the removal of
the NB groups compared to that of TBA5NB·CS5G duplex (12.9
°C for TBA(5,8)NB2·CS(5,8)G7T duplex against 4.1 °C
for TBA5NB·CS5G duplex as ΔTm) encouraged us to investigate its reduction-responsive structural
transition. On the basis of the Tm values
and the melting curves, temperature was set at 30 °C, where TBA(5,8)NB2·CS(5,8)G7T duplex was thermodynamically stable but TBA·CS(5,8)G7T duplex
became unstable.

of TBA and CS(5,8)G7T (purple dashed line) are also shown. The experimental temperature

of Na2S2O4, (c) CS(5,8)G7T, (d) TBA(5,8)NB2, and (e) TBA (detection at 260 nm). Conditions: TBA(5,8)NB2·CS(5,8)G7T (10 μM), Na2S2O4/TBA(5,8)NB2·CS(5,8)G7T = 1050 ([Na2S2O4] = 10.5 mM), 100 mM HEPES (pH 7.0) buffer
with 0.1 mM EDTA and 105 mM KCl, and 0.1 cm cell length. (E) Schematic
representations showing reduction-triggered dissociation of double-stranded
helix to simultaneously form the G-quadruplex with the release of
a nearly complementary strand.

After the addition of Na2S2O4 to
the TBA(5,8)NB2·CS(5,8)G7T duplex at 30 °C, a remarkable
increase in the CD intensity at 292 nm, which is characteristic of
the TBA G-quadruplex, was observed within 3 min (Figure 4C). Also, the spectrum
after addition of Na2S2O4 was almost
identical to the mixture of the TBA G-quadruplex and CS(5,8)G7T and was comparable to a
simple theoretical sum of each spectrum (Figure 4C). The difference between the experimental
spectrum of the mixture containing TBA G-quadruplex and CS(5,8)G7T and the theoretical sum
of each spectrum implies that the system might not reach to the equilibrium
state to provide the complete formation of TBA G-quadruplex
under these conditions; in other words, TBA·CS(5,8)G7T duplex and the TBA G-quadruplex would be in equilibrium, as depicted in Figure 4E.26 IP RP HPLC analyses (Figure 4D) as well as mass spectra clearly indicate an almost quantitative
conversion from TBA(5,8)NB2 (tR = 15.1 min) to TBA after addition
of Na2S2O4. These results support
that the dissociation of the TBA(5,8)NB2·CS(5,8)G7T duplex
and the simultaneous intramolecular G-quadruplex folding of TBA were essentially triggered after addition of the reducing
reagent Na2S2O4.

Stimuli-controlled
transition at high-order structures of nucleic
acids is useful for various applications.28 Nevertheless, single-stranded oligonucleotides are mostly utilized
as input signals, which can induce structural transitions following
strand exchange reactions via taking advantage of complementary duplex
formation, the so called strand displacement, in particular, using
the single-stranded toehold motif.29 In
contrast, examples of tertiary structural transition triggered by
stimuli other than such single-stranded oligonucleotides are still
rather limited. For example, Miyoshi et al. describe that molecular
crowding conditions can induce the transition from duplex to quadruplex,
which is highly valuable to gain deep understanding of biological
events.30 Very recently, Manderville et
al. developed a TBA with a fluorescent guanine derivative
that allows monitoring structural transitions from duplex to G-quadruplex
by fluorescence spectral changes in response to the binding of the
modified TBA to thrombin.31 Zhou et al. explored a photoresponsive G-quadruplex binding molecule
to modulate G-quadruplex formation in response to light irradiation
as external stimulus.32 In addition, Liu
et al. reported pH-driven reversible conformational changes between
four- and double-stranded structures on a thin gold surface.33 This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first
example wherein DNA structural transition was induced from duplex
to quadruplex in response to reduction stimuli. Considering our previous
study, it is reasonably expected that this NB group-based reduction
responsiveness can be extended to biomolecule responsiveness after
coupling with enzymatic reactions.34

Conclusions
We successfully constructed reduction-responsive
DNA duplexes,
in which guanine rings bearing a reduction-responsive cleavable NB
group, were introduced at discrete positions and sequences. Moreover,
we found that the duplexes exhibit reduction-responsive structural
transitions, depending on their sequences. Not only structural transition
from intermolecular duplex to intramolecular quadruplex was observed
but also the removal of artificial NB groups from intermolecular duplex
without its dissociation was demonstrated. Both phenomena are useful
for exploring switch functions of biological events, involving DNA
duplex and/or quadruplex structures. To explain the behavior of tertiary
structures of DNA that contain guanine rings with NB, comprehensive
structural studies, such as NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography,
may be necessary. Further research along these lines is currently
in progress in our laboratory.

Materials and Methods
Unless stated
otherwise, all commercial reagents were used as received.
Thrombin-binding aptamer (TBA, d(GGTTGGTGTGGTTGG)) and
other oligonucleotides, purified by ion-pair reversed-phase, high-performance
liquid chromatography (IP RP HPLC), were synthesized by Fasmac Corp.
(Kanagawa, Japan). The concentration of TBA was determined
at 260 nm and 75 °C using a molar absorption coefficient (1.46
× 105 M–1 cm–1).25 All water used in the experiments
refers to ultrapure water obtained from a Millipore system having
a specific resistance of 18 MΩ cm. IP RP HPLC was conducted
with a Shimadzu Prominence instrument LC-20AD and SPD-20A equipped
with a GL Science Inertsil ODS-3 column (150 mm × 4.6 mm I.D.,
5 μm) for analysis and GL Science Inertsil ODS-3 column (150
mm × 10 mm I.D., 5 μm) for purifications in a column oven
CTO-20A. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) coupled
with time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu
AXIMA-CFR plus mass spectrometer. UV–vis spectra were obtained
using a Jasco V-630 or a Shimadzu UV-2450 spectrophotometer.

Solid-Phase
Oligonucleotide Synthesis
Oligonucleotide
synthesis for TBA5NB and TBA(5,8)NB2 was carried out on an
NTS H-6 DNA/RNA synthesizer (Nihon Techno Service) using the phosphoramidite
method (commercially available phosphoramidite for dG and dC with
synthetized dGNB reported previously17) at a 1 μmol scale. After cleavage from the solid
support, deprotection of bases and phosphates was performed in aqueous
ammonia (1.0 mL, 28%) at 55 °C for 12 h. The purification of
the “trityl-on” oligonucleotide was carried out on IP
RP HPLC ((GL Science Inertsil ODS-3 column (150 mm × 10 mm I.D.)),
linear gradient from A/B = 100:0 (A: 0.1 M triethylamine acetate (TEAA)
containing 5% acetonitrile, B: acetonitrile) to 50:50 over 30 min
was used with a flow rate of 3.0 mL/min, detection wavelength = 260
nm). The purified “trityl-on” oligonucleotide was treated
with 80% CH3COOH for 15 min at 37 °C to remove the
dimethoxytrityl residues. The detritylated oligomer was purified by
IP RP HPLC ((GL Science Inertsil ODS-3 column (150 mm × 10 mm
I.D.)), linear gradient from A/B = 100:0 (A: 0.1 M TEAA containing
5% acetonitrile, B: acetonitrile) to 50:50 over 30 min was used with
a flow rate of 3.0 mL/min, detection wavelength = 260 nm). IP RP HPLC
charts are shown in Figure S1. The identity
of the oligonucleotides TBA5NB and TBA(5,8)NB2 has been established
by MALDI-TOF MS (matrix: 3-hydroxypicolinic acid (3-HPA), negative, Figure S2), and the observed molecular weights
were in good agreement with their structures: TBA5NB, calcd for [M – H]−: 4874.1, found: 4876.1 and TBA(5,8)NB2, calcd. for [M – H]−: 5030.1, found:
5031.3. The oligonucleotide concentrations were determined by UV spectroscopy.
The molar extinction coefficient (at 260 nm) ratio of dGNB/dG (=1.15) was used to determine the concentrations of TBANB and TBA(5,8)NB2 by measurements of absorbance (260 nm) at 75 °C.

Thermal
Denaturation Experiments
Duplex Sample Preparation
Hybridization
to construct duplexes
was accomplished by mixing equal amounts of purified TBAs with or without GNB (TBA, TBANB, or TBA(5,8)NB2) and their complemented strands with designated
number of mismatches to a final concentration of 100 μM in (A)
10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.6) containing 100 mM KCl or (B) 100 mM
HEPES buffer (pH 7.0) containing 105 mM KCl. The samples were heated
at 95 °C for 5 min followed by cooling to room temperature over
a period of approximately 1 h. The samples were then stored at 4 °C
until experiments were accomplished.

Ultraviolet (UV) Melting
Experiments
UV melting experiments
were carried out on a Jasco V-630 spectrometer equipped with a programmable
temperature-control unit (Jasco ETCS-761) using a 0.1 cm quartz cell
unless otherwise noted. The melting temperatures (Tms) were determined from the maximum in the first derivatives
of the melting curves (absorbance at 260 nm against temperature, 0.5
°C/min). Oligonucleotides were diluted at a final concentration
of 10 μM in aqueous buffers.

Circular Dichroism (CD)
Spectral Measurements and Melting Experiments
CD experiments
were carried out on a Jasco J-820 spectropolarimeter
equipped with a programmable temperature-control unit (Julabo HP-4)
using a 0.1 cm quartz cell unless otherwise noted. CD spectra were
obtained by using a 1 nm slit width and a scanning step of 0.1 nm
from 320 to 230 nm. Each spectrum was an average of eight scans with
the buffer background subtracted. The melting temperatures (Tms) were determined from the maximum in the
first derivatives of the melting curves (CD intensity at 292 nm against
temperature, 1.0 °C/min).

Monitoring Reduction-Responsive
Structural Change by CD and
IP RP HPLC
Stock solution of oligonucleotide duplexes was
diluted with an aqueous buffer to afford solutions containing oligonucleotide duplexes (10 μM).
The reductant (Na2S2O4) was then
added to adjust ca. 10 mM as the final concentrations in the mixture.
After incubation at designated temperature (25, 30, or 35 °C),
CD spectral changes were measured under the conditions mentioned above.
Also, the reaction mixture was subjected to IP RP HPLC analysis (GL
Science Inertsil ODS-3 column (150 mm × 4.6 mm I.D., 5 μm),
linear gradient from A/B = 100:0 (A: 0.1 M TEAA containing 5% acetonitrile,
B: acetonitrile) to 50:50 over 30 min was used with a flow rate of
1.0 mL/min, detection wavelength = 260 nm, column oven temperature
= 40 °C). The identity of the starting oligonucleotides (TBA5NB, TBA(5,8)NB2) and the desired reduction product (TBA) were established by comparing the retention time of authentic standard
as well as MALDI-TOF MS spectra. Experiment was repeated in at least
duplicates.

This is the similar order
of decreasing thermal
stability reported previously for O6-benzylguanine
(GB) paired with the canonical bases in double-stranded
helical structures of ODNs. GB as well as O6-methylguanine (GMe) is frequently found as O6-alkylguanine lesions.

The phosphate buffer was used for the evaluation
of Tm due to temperature dependent pKa of HEPES. The HEPES buffer was used for the
other experiments in relationship to our previous study. Nevertheless,
there was no significant difference in thermal melting behaviors in
this study as far as we tested.

CD spectrum of the mixture containing TBA G-quadruplex
and CS(5,8)G7T became almost
identical to the theoretical sum of each spectrum
at higher temperature such as 35 °C (Figure S7). However, at
35 °C, the considerable portion (ca. 40%) of the initial TBA(5,8)NB2·CS(5,8)G7T duplex would dissociate into two unfolded
single-stranded structures judging from its UV thermal melting curve.
The CD spectral change at 25 °C is also presented in Figure S8,
which shows the smaller change compared with that at 30 °C. Thereby,
temperature near 30 °C would be optimal conditions to induce
structural transition from duplex to quadruplex as large as possible
in this system.
