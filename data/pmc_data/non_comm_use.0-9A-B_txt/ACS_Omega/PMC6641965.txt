In
this paper, we present a smartphone platform for colorimetric
water quality detection based on the use of built-in camera for capturing
a single-use reference image. A custom-developed app processes this
image for training and creates a reference model to be used later
in real experimental conditions to calculate the concentration of
the unknown solution. This platform has been tested on four different
water quality colorimetric assays with various concentration levels,
and results show that the presented platform provides approximately
100% accuracy for colorimetric assays with noticeable color difference.
This portable, cost-effective, and user-friendly platform is promising
for application in water quality monitoring.

Introduction
Colorimetry is a major
technique used in physical and analytical
chemistry that aims to quantify the concentration of colored solutions.1 Colorimeters are instruments that quantify concentration
via absorbance measurements using spectrophotometry and Beer–Lambert
law,2 and they are available for both laboratory
and field use depending on the complexity of the experiment. The advances
in smartphone technology, with the help of three-dimensional printing,
helped to realize colorimetric measurements for a wide range of chemical
and biological analytes.3 Several smartphone
colorimeter designs were demonstrated for water quality sensing for
environment,4,5 leaf color analysis for agriculture,6 pH,7,8 glucose sensing,9 and peanut allergen detection.10 Apart from colorimeters in the traditional sense, color
data were obtained from paper-based sensors, where color change is
quantified by parameters in various color spaces, that is RGB, HSV,
and L*a*b*.11−15 A representative study in this category is ref (15), where alcohol concentration
was detected in saliva using paper-based test converting images from
RGB to HSV color space. This methodology has the advantage of requiring
only a smartphone for taking and processing an image with variety
of colors. Further, nontraditional colorimeters were demonstrated
on liquid samples in vials for chlorine detection16 and fruits for ripeness estimation.6 These systems estimate color by using analytical formulas extracted
from color space parameters and are prone to disadvantages of JPEG
images such as low bit depth and heavy postprocessing (white balance,
contrast, and brightness adjustment).17,18 However, we
have previously shown that JPEG images could play a significant role
in colorimetric detection when used as a part of training set for
machine learning algorithms.12,19 Using more advanced
methods such as machine learning, classifiers require much larger
data sets and high computational power for training.19,20 Here, we show a new methodology for simple colorimetric detection
of water quality using smartphone-embedded color matching algorithms
on JPEG images under well-defined experimental conditions. This study
differentiates itself from our previous work12 by using simple color matching algorithms to detect the concentration
in real time with rapid response necessary for lab-on-a-chip systems.

Recently, researchers have proposed lab-on-a-chip design for several
distinct applications.21,22 Salles et al.,21 used paper-based test to detect explosive types using hierarchical
clustering analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) regarding
the color discrimination of the explosives. Images were captured in
a closed chamber to eliminate ambient light conditions. Helfer et
al.22 employed linear correlation and PCA
methods, respectively, for univariate and multivariate analysis. They
stated that the results of univariate analysis were not statistically
significant and ambient conditions might one of the reasons as images
were not captured in a controlled environment. However, they reported
promising results from multivariate analysis which used eight different
color spaces together with PCA and clustering methods including red,
green, blue, hue, saturation, value, lightness, and intensity. In
this study, our proposed method is computationally cheaper than aforementioned
studies,21,22 which reduces computation time for output
calculation. In addition, we aim to quantify the solution concentration
level, which is more challenging compared to the discrimination of
the distinct inputs.

Vashist et al.23 proposed a smartphone-based
colorimetric reader for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, where
images were captured in a controlled environment illuminated from
the bottom. Ozcan and his research group24−29 have significantly contributed to this field, driven by applications
such as food allergen testing,24 urine25 and blood26 analysis,
immunoassays,27 microscopy,28 and cytometry.29 Here,
for the first time, we have proposed using local database referenced
with a single image for the quantification of concentration level
of solutions. The proposed system is able to calibrate an entire set
of concentrations for four water quality parameters (nitrite, phosphate,
chromium, and phenol) using a single image to obtain the reference
data, which is further used to predict concentration of an unknown
solution with great accuracy. The main motivation is to design a portable,
cost-effective, and user-friendly platform and develop the experimental
methodology that can easily be applied to any lab bench without the
need for expensive equipment and has the potential to transform colorimetry
for both regular and citizen scientists.

Results and Discussion
In Figure 1a,b,
the performance of the ΔE* and color-correlation
(CC) methods in detecting phosphate concentration levels is presented
with confusion matrices, where each row of the matrix represents the
instances in an actual (true) class, whereas each column represents
the instances in a predicted class. The confusion matrices were created
based on selecting 50 random test areas from six different concentration
levels of phosphate, nitrite, and phenol solutions and from seven
different concentration levels of chromium solutions. Figure 1c shows the selection of random
areas from the region of interest. Because of the space constraint,
the results of other assays are provided in the Supporting Information. One can see from the confusion matrices
in the Figure 1a,b
that ΔE* method outperforms the CC method in
correctly identifying the concentration levels of phosphate, where
the maximum number of misclassified concentration is only one for
each true label. Furthermore, misclassification only happens between
neighboring concentration values. The overall performance of the two
methods was compared by calculation detection accuracy, which is the
ratio of sum of diagonal elements of confusion matrix to total number
of data points. The detection accuracy of the CC method was obtained
as 23.3, 33, 26.3, and 26.2%, whereas it was 100, 98.7, 100, and 76%
for the ΔE* method for chromium, phosphate,
nitrite, and phenol, respectively. Hence, ΔE* method should be preferred to run in the Android app because of
its superior overall performance over the CC method. To further evaluate
the performance of the ΔE* method in automatically
identifying the concentration levels of the solutions, we use metrics
of classification report, referred to as precision, recall, and f1-score.
Precision is defined as the proportion of true positive events to
the sum of true and false positive events in a classification task.
Recall measures the proportion of true positive events to the sum
of true positive and false positive events, whereas f1-score considers
both the precision and the recall of the binary test to compute a
total score, f1, which is equal to 1 for perfect precision and recall.
We present the precision, recall, and f1-scores of the ΔE* method for automatically classifying phosphate concentrations
in Table 1, where f1-score
of 0.99 is reached. For classifying concentration levels of both chromium
and nitrite, the proposed approach achieved even better results with
a perfect confusion matrix and an f1-score of 1.

Figure 1 Confusion matrices using
the ΔE* and the
CC methods for phosphate are given in (a,b), respectively. Random
area selection from the solutions for the calculation of performance
metrics is shown in (c).

a Support is the

of each particular class.

However, the misclassification of the concentration levels of phenol
is significantly higher compared to the misclassification of phosphate,
nitrite, and chromium as the confusion matrix of phenol diverges from
being diagonal (see Supporting Information). The precision, the recall, and the f1-scores for phenol are obtained
as 0.77, 0.76, and 0.76, respectively.

The diminished classification
performance is attributed to the
less pronounced color transition between successive phenol solutions
in Figure 3b. To analyze
the effect of color transition on the performance, histogram representations
of phosphate and phenol are given in Figure 2. The histogram representation of phosphate
was shown with stairs for 0, 0.75, and 3 ppm, and the transition of
R, G, and B channel by the concentration is very distinct. However,
it is more similar for phenol shown with bar plots. Nevertheless,
we believe that our proposed single-image referencing is a better
approach to identify subtle color transitions between phenol concentrations
(i.e., 0–0.20 ppm) compared to the human eye inspection.

In some applications,20,23 there is a tendency
to create a big data set, including images from various smartphones
to make the system robust to variations in smartphone specifications,
which causes increased computational complexity. One advantage of
the proposed system is that the training data set needs to be created
by the user for the smartphone to be used. As the training and test
images are captured with the same smartphone, the issues caused by
specifications of the smartphone are eliminated.

Despite the
fact that our proposed approach is very promising for
colorimetric applications, there are some constraints and limitations
associated with it. First, the method relies on training discrete
levels of concentration and the experimental phase assumes that the
unknown solution is also at a discrete level. If an unknown solution
with an untrained concentration is tested, our app will assign the
closest concentration as the result. This is different from intuitive
thinking in spectrophotometry, where an analytical formula is used
to predict any concentration level. The detection accuracy depends
on the color transition of the solutions, and poor color transition
may result in reduced accuracy for smaller concentrations, as in the
case of phenol experiment. Second, the experimental conditions need
to be kept constant between training and experimental phases. To get
rapid response, each training data set was created for the respective
solution and experimental conditions. Therefore, the required computational
power to detect the concentration level is minimized. The user needs
to keep smartphone camera settings the same, while making sure the
illumination conditions do not change. Any relocation of the imaging
setup to another illumination setting will cause retraining of the
colorimetric assays. It is worth mentioning that because it is supervised
learning, the predictions for untrained samples are prone to poor
results.

Conclusions
In this paper, we devote our endeavors
to build a smartphone platform
that is able to monitor water quality in a portable, low-cost, and
user-friendly manner. Our platform runs on an Android app and has
been tested with four different colorimetric assays with different
color transitions between successive solutions. The main features
can be summarized as follows:1 the user can create reusable experimental
models for respective assays;

2 multiple regions of interest can be
accurately selected in real time; and

3 rapid and reliable results are calculated
using pretrained models.



All pictures
were captured by a smartphone in a controlled environment
to satisfy the similar conditions for all pictures and also to eliminate
the issues caused by illumination variations. A reference model was
created for each assay to calculate the concentration level of unknown
solutions with the help of color matching algorithms. The experimental
results demonstrated that the discrete concentration level of the
individual solutions could be reliably calculated. The detection accuracy
can even reach 100% if the color transition in the reference model
is more pronounced. The limitations associated with the proposed platform
could be an interesting research area in the future.

Materials and
Methods
Experimental Design
To test our methodology, a conceptual
experimental setup was designed as illustrated in Figure 3a. A cardboard box (40 × 40 × 25 cm) painted white
inside was used to provide a portable photo studio suitable for lab
benches. A slim tube with surface-mounted white light-emitting diodes
inside (LedTimes Co., LT-9960S) was placed inside on the box ceiling
15 cm over the samples for illumination purposes. The setup includes
an optional sample holder platform at the same height as the camera.
Images were taken using a smartphone (LG G4, 1/2.6 in. sensor size
with 5312 × 2988 resolution, 1.12 μm pixel size) located
30 cm away from the samples. The smartphone camera was used in manual
mode, and the shutter speed (1/30 s), ISO level (50), focus level
(f1.8), and white balance settings were all kept constant during imaging.

Figure 3 Experimental
setup is given in (a) and the four different colorimetric
assays used in the experiments are shown in (b).

Assays
Four different colorimetric assays of nitrite
(NO2–), phosphate (PO43–), hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)), and phenol were prepared
according to the colorimetric standard methods (4500-NO2–-E, 4500-P-E, 3500-Cr-B, and ISO 6439).30,31 The preparations of the assays are provided in the Supporting Information. Figure 3b shows the photographic images of the solutions with
different concentration levels ranging from 0 to 3.00 ppm. It can
be clearly observed that as the concentration of each analyte increases,
the NO2–, PO43– and Cr(VI) solutions get noticeably darker, whereas phenol assay
color difference is not substantial.

ChemTrainerSIR Mobile App
To test the colorimetric
assays, we upgraded our custom mobile application ChemTrainer19 for single-image reference (SIR) named as ChemTrainerSIR.
Screenshots of the app given in Figure 4 explain the flow of training (from b to g) and experiment
procedures (from h to m). Users can train models for multiple assay
types and later use these models to measure concentration levels in
newly acquired photographs. To train a model with the app, the user
first enters the name of the chemical compound as the name of the
model (e.g., phosphate), the units of measurement (e.g., ppm), and
the number of samples with known concentration levels (e.g., 0–3)
that their photographs will have. Then, the user either captures the
photograph of the collection of samples or loads it from the smartphone
gallery. The user proceeds to mark each sample with a rectangle (preferably
inside the vial) and enters the known concentration level for that
sample. The photograph, marked areas, and their concentration levels
are stored in a designated folder in the devices internal storage.

Figure 4 (a) Steps
of the colorimetric detection with a single image. Training
steps are presented at the top row (b–g) while the user utilizes
the trained model during the experimental phase as in the bottom row
(h–m).

Digital Image Processing
When the user wants to measure
a solution of unknown concentration on a new image, the previously
trained model that is appropriate for the solution to be tested first
needs to be selected. Then, the user either captures a photograph
of the solution or loads it from the gallery and marks the colored
area on the photograph. The app then uses the trained model along
with color matching algorithm to calculate the concentration level
of the solution. The photograph, marked area, and calculated concentration
level are stored in another designated folder in the devices internal
storage.

In this demonstration, an unknown solution was centered
alone for testing, whereas reference solutions were imaged as a group
in a single shot during training. Hence, some of the reference solutions
were not located at the center, although this has a negligible effect
on the color reproducibility due to controlled illumination conditions.

One challenge in running colorimetric tests in a smartphone is
to be able to finalize the result in a short time. Because the processing
power of a smartphone is usually limited, a simple and efficient method
is preferred rather than sophisticated methods, as they usually require
high computational power. Therefore, we employ two different color
matching algorithms with low computational complexity and compare
them to select the best method to be run on a smartphone. The first
one is CC method,32 which calculates correlation
coefficients between test image and trained images. The value of the
coefficient varies between 0 and 1, where the highest similarity is
indicated by 1 and the lowest similarity is represented by 0. The
second method is based on measuring color differences between two
images using deltaE (ΔE*) distance metric obtained
from the CIE 1976 L*a*b* color difference formula33 1  Here, L*, a*, and b* are dimensions of the CIE L*a*b* color space, where L* axis represents lightness in the range of black (0) to
white (100), whereas the a* axis varies over red
(+a*) to green (−a*) and
the b* axis describes yellow (+b*) to blue (−b*). Contrary to the CC method,
ΔE* calculates a lower score for the similar
images as the distance between similar images is smaller than the
distance between dissimilar images. In this study, all images are
converted to L*a*b* color space as it is more robust to illumination variations.34

To test the Android app and the color
matching algorithms, the
colorimetric assays in Figure 3b were first processed from the captured images and saved
with their corresponding concentration values. During the experimental
test phase, the individual photograph of each concentration in every
assay was taken and the marked area was cropped and sent to CC and
ΔE* methods to detect the corresponding solution.
Here, the image processing algorithm works as follows. First, the
cropped patch from the test assay was converted to L*a*b* color space as all reference
patches were in that format. For ΔE* score
calculation, ΔL*, Δa*, and Δb* were calculated by subtracting L*, a*, and b* channels
of test and reference images, respectively. Then, ΔE* for each pixel was calculated using eq 1. By averaging ΔE*
scores of the pixels, final ΔE* scores between
test and reference image were obtained. This process was repeated
for all reference images. Therefore, one test image had several ΔE* scores, and the smallest one points to the most similar
matching. Similar process was repeated for the CC method and correlation
coefficients between test image and reference images were calculated,
and the highest coefficient indicates the highest similarity. These
two algorithms were compared in terms of performance metrics regularly
used in machine learning for multiclass classifiers. These metrics
are confusion matrix, detection accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score.
