Optical
properties of three types of terthiophene (3T) functionalized
conjugated triarm (star-shaped) polymers consisting of poly(9,9-di-n-octyl-fluorene-2,7-vinylene) (PFV) arms and different
[2,4,6-tri(biphenyl)benzene (TBP), 1,3,5-tri(benzyl)benzene (TBB),
and triphenylamine (TPA)] cores, prepared by combined olefin metathesis
with Wittig coupling, have been studied. Relative intensities [increases
in the higher vibronic bands, (0, 1) fluorescence (FL)] of the fully
conjugated TPA-core polymers, TPA(PFV-3T)3, in the fluorescence
(FL) spectra in tetrahydrofuran (toluene) solution were higher than
those in the other triarm polymers, TBP(PFV-3T)3, TBB(PFV-3T)3, whereas no significant differences were observed in their
UV–vis spectra; notable temperature dependences were not observed
in the UV–vis and FL spectra (at −5, 25, and 55 °C).
Remarkable differences were not observed in the spectra in these polymer
thin films, whereas λmax values red-shifted due to
the formation of J-type aggregates. The observation
for the time-resolved study well corresponds to results for the steady-state
fluorescence measurements. The observed unique emission by the star-shaped
(triarm) polymer containing the TPA core would be assumed to be due
to a difference in nature of the core (higher coplanarity) compared
to that of the others.

Introduction
Conjugated polymers
(CPs) are promising functional materials in
terms of application as optoelectronic, electrochemical devices.1−10 Their importance in the synthesis of defect-free materials, such
as structurally regularity and chemically purity, has been recognized
because they exhibit better electronic and photophysical properties.
Moreover, structural perfection and chemical purity largely impact
device efficiency. Optoelectronic properties of CPs are largely impacted
by the end groups,11−28 as demonstrated by poly(fluorene)s11−20 and poly(9,9-dialkyl-fluorene-2,7-vinylene)s (PFVs).21−28 It has also been known that supramolecular interactions (hydrogen
bonding, and intermolecular noncovalent π–π, CH/π,
and van der Waals interactions) as well as their organization of nano-
and mesoscales influence their intrinsic properties.29−31 In particular, interchain interaction, the electronic communication
between distinct polymer chains, plays an essential role in light
emission and charge transport.32−34

It has been known that
star-shaped conjugated dendrimers and oligomers35−43 with well-defined chemical structures exhibit better mechanical
properties and solubility in organic solvents in organic light-emitting
devices.43−49 However, reports on the precise synthesis of fully conjugated star
polymers with well-defined end groups still have been limited.50−54 This would be because of the difficulty in performing exclusive
synthesis (introduction of side arms into/from the core molecules)
via grafting from/to (using multi-initiator or terminator) approaches.
Moreover, studies concerning the effect of cores have so far not been
reported in detail.

Recently, we demonstrated an efficient one-pot
synthesis of defect-free
(all-trans), fully conjugated star-shaped (triarm) polymers containing
an end-functionalized PFV arm by adopting combined olefin metathesis
with Wittig-type coupling.24 In particular,
the resultant star polymers containing ferrocene or terthiophene (3T)
end groups show unique emission properties, which affects the relative
intensities as well as photoluminescence quantum yield (ΦFL) in the fluorescence (FL) spectra.24 In this report, we thus have prepared 3T-modified triarm (star-shaped)
PFVs containing different cores (Chart 1) and demonstrated the effect of core toward the emission
property only in solution on the basis of UV–vis and fluorescence
spectra (at various temperatures) and in thin films on the basis of
excitation and time-resolved fluorescence spectra. The goal of this
work is to contribute to establish reliable structure property relationships
thanks to the synthesis of conjugated polymers with a precisely controlled
structure.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis of Terthiophene (3T) Functionalized
Triarm (Star-Shaped)
Polymers Containing Poly(fluorene-2,7-vinylene) (PFV) Arms
Three types of terthiophene (3T) functionalized conjugated triarm
(star-shaped) polymers consisting of poly(9,9-di-n-octyl-fluorene-2,7-vinylene) (PFV) and different cores (shown in Chart 1) have been focused
on this study.a This is because three phenyl
groups in the triphenylamine (TPA) core in poly(3) are
partially conjugated, whereas three phenyl groups in the tris(biphenyl)benzene
(TBP) core in poly(1) have no conjugation due to placement
in the meta-position56,57 and conjugation was terminated
at the methylene units in the 1,3,5-tri(benzyl)benzene (TBB) core
in poly(2). According to a previous report,24 PFV prepared by acyclic diene metathesis polymerization58−75 has been chosen, not only because the approach affords defect-free,
stereo-regular (all-trans) materials,26−28,58−64 but also because the method enables us to afford the π-conjugated
polymers with well-defined chain ends (vinyl groups prepared by Ru
catalysts) that are suitable for the subsequent end modification by
treatment of the vinyl groups with molybdenum-alkylidene catalyst
followed by Wittig-type cleavage with aldehyde.21−28,61,76−78

According to Scheme 1 and the previously established procedure,24 the vinyl groups in the PFVs’ chain ends
were treated with Mo(CHCMe2Ph)(N-2,6-Me2C6H3)[OCMe(CF3)2] (Mo
cat., 1.8 equiv to PFV, for complete conversion of Mo in situ),
and to the mixture was then added a CH2Cl2 solution
containing tris aldehyde [2,4,6-tri(4′-formyl-biphenyl)benzene
express as TBP(CHO)3, 1,3,5-tri(2′-formylbenzyl)benzene
expressed as TBB(CHO)3, and tris(4-formylphenyl)amine expressed
as TPA(CHO)3] as the core segment.a To the reaction mixture was added a toluene solution containing Mo cat. (3 equiv) for completion of the olefin metathesis,
and the subsequent addition of 2,2′:5′,2″-terthiophene-5-carboxaldehyde
(3T-CHO) in an excess amount afforded the 3T-functionalized triarm
PFVs [TBP(PFV-3T)3, poly(1)], [TBB(PFV-3T)3, poly(2)], [TPA(PFV-3T)3, and poly(3)].a,55 As reported in the synthesis of poly(3),24 the Mn values of
the resulting polymers estimated by gel permeation chromatography
(GPC) are analogous to those on the basis of starting PFV samples;
both the Mn values and the Mw/Mn values in the resultant
polymers were reproducible with uniform distributions (Table S2).a Resonances
ascribed to protons in the terthiophene (3T) moiety in the resultant
polymers, poly(1–3), in the 1H NMR spectra were clearly observed,a whereas resonances ascribed to protons of the vinyl groups in the
starting PFVs were diminished; as reported previously,24 further confirmations/purifications of samples
were made by GPC, fractionation (due to different solubilities between
the star polymer and the starting PFV), or fractional high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) (detailed procedures and analysis data
are shown in the Supporting Information).a,55

UV–Vis and Fluorescence Spectra for
Terthiophene (3T)
Functionalized Triarm PFV Having Different Cores
Figure 1 shows UV–vis
spectra and fluorescence spectra (excitation at 420 nm) for the resultant
triarm (star-shaped) polymers (in tetrahydrofuran (THF) at 25 °C,
concn 1.0 × 10–6 M), expressed as TBP(PFV-3T)3 [poly(1), Mn = 26 000, Mw/Mn = 1.87, run
S1 in Table S2],a,55 TBB(PFV-3T)3 [poly(2), Mn = 23 000, Mw/Mn = 1.91 run
S4], and TPA(PFV-3T)3, [poly(3), Mn = 27 000, Mw/Mn = 1.68 run S6], having the same PFV arms.
It was revealed that no significant differences in the spectra were
observed in the UV–vis spectra (Figure 1a). This is the same observation for the
triarm PFVs containing different end groups,24 as well as linear PFVs with different end groups.21−27,61,76,77 As reported previously in the UV–vis
spectra of PFVs (in solution),26,27,58,59,79,80 two absorption bands at 427 and 455 nm (Figure 1a) are attributed
to π–π* transitions of the conjugated backbone.79 Three absorption peaks at 456, 429, and 400
nm are attributed to 0–0, 0–1, and 0–2 transitions,
respectively,80 with the corresponding
emission intensity maxima at 465, 496, and 527 nm (Figure 1b; λmax values
in the spectra are summarized in Table 1, shown below). As shown in Figure 2a, no significant solvent effects in the
fluorescence spectra were observed (THF, toluene). Moreover, as reported
previously, significant increase of intensities in higher vibronic
bands was observed in the fluorescence spectra in the PFV introduced
terthiophene (3T) into the chain ends,21,23,24,27,81,82 whereas such effects were not
observed by the end modification by C6F5, C6H5, pyridyl, metalloporphyrin, and so on.21,23−27,61,76,77 As shown in Figure 2b, relative intensities (increase in the
intensities at higher vibronic bands, at 496, 527, and 576 nm) were
dependent on the PFV chain length (affected by the conjugation repeat
units), as demonstrated previously.21 More
recently, on the basis of time-resolved fluorescence and anisotropy
studies, the longer decay component can be ascribed to a species of
which π-system of the excited PFV part is expanded over the
end group after coplanarization of the terthiophene unit upon excitation.81

Note that relative intensities (increases in the higher vibronic
bands) in poly(3) were higher than those in poly(1) and poly(2), as shown in Figure 1b, whereas no significant differences
were observed in their UV–vis spectra (Figure 1a), as described above. This would thus suggest
that the degree of expansion of the π-system through coplanarization
of the terthiophene unit upon excitation was affected by the core
fragment employed (TPA vs TBP, TBB). It was revealed that no significant
temperature dependences of both UV–vis spectra and their fluorescence
spectra were observed in poly(1–3) (in THF at 25 °C, concn 1.0 × 10–6 M, Figures S2-1 and S2-2; these spectra are shown
in the Supporting Information).b

Moreover, as observed previously in the end-functionalized
PFVs,21,27 fluorescence spectra for the PFV sample
containing triphenylamine
(TPA) chain ends in both sidesa were similar
to that for the PFV containing bithiophene (2T),21 pyrene,a and the original PFV (before
end modifications), as shown in Figure S2-3 (top),b whereas unique emission (increases
in the higher vibronic bands) were observed in the spectrum for PFV
containing 3T in both the ends.21,b As reported previously,27 in the linear PFV samples, degree of the unique emission
is dependent on the number of terthiophene end groups (one or two)
as well as the PFV conjugation length (Figure S2-3 bottom).b It thus turned out that
the degree of increase in the higher vibronic bands in poly(3) is apparently higher than that in the linear PFV containing
only one 3T segment at the chain end. These results clearly suggest
that the observed unique emission in poly(3) was not
due to an influence through the end groups, but would be due to the
unique triarm (topological, star) structure.

Because poly(3) has a triphenylamine (TPA) core that
shows unique fluorescence spectra in solution compared to the others
[poly(1) having a 2,4,6-tri(biphenyl)benzene (TBP) core
and poly(2) having a 1,3,5-tri(benzyl)benzene (TBB) core]
and no temperature dependences toward their spectra were observed
(measured in THF at −5, 25, and 55 °C),b the concentration dependence of excitation and emission spectra
for poly(3) in toluene was studied (Figure 3). First, the excitation spectra
have no monitored wavelength dependence (Figure 3a), suggesting that there is only one species
that absorbs light preceding emission. Moreover, there is no concentration
dependence of excitation and emission spectra (Figure 3b–e). This clearly indicates that
there are no aggregation effects under these conditions. Similar concentration
dependences (in excitation and emission spectra) and wavelength dependences
were also confirmed in poly(1) and poly(2) (detailed data are shown in Figures S3-1 and S3-2, Supporting Information).b

UV–Vis and Fluorescence Spectra for
Poly(1–3) in Thin Films
To study whether unique
emission by poly(3) was observed in the solid state or
not, UV–vis and fluorescence spectra of the resultant 3T-modified
triarm polymers, poly(1–3), were
measured in thin films prepared by drop-casting and spin-coating methods
(Figures 4 and 5).

(c) spin-coat].

Fluorescence spectra (excitation at 420 nm) for (d) poly(1), (e) poly(2), and (f) poly(3).

As shown in Figure 4, the λmax values of the
PFV films in the UV–vis
spectra red-shifted in all cases (λmax = 400, 429,
and 456 nm (in THF solution); λmax = 411, 433, and
462 nm (in drop-cast film); λmax = 409, 431, and
464 nm (in spin-coat film); these data are summarized in Table 1), and no significant
differences were observed in the samples prepared by the spin-coating
method, whereas absorbances at 411 and 433 nm in poly(2) and poly(3) were rather higher than those in poly(1). The red-shift in the spectra suggests the formation of J-type aggregates. It seems that there are slight differences
in the λmax values between drop-cast and spin-coat
films (Figure 4d–f)
probably due to differences in the process of film preparation (formation
of supramolecular assemblies).

It also turned out that, as shown
in Figure 5, the λmax values of the
PFV films in the fluorescence spectra red-shifted in all cases (λmax = 465, 496, and 527 nm (in THF solution); λmax = 478, 503, and 538 nm (in drop-cast film); λmax = 479, 505, and 539 nm (in spin-coat film); these data are summarized
in Table 1). These
red-shifts in the spectra also suggest the formation of J-type aggregates. It also seems that there are slight differences
in the λmax values between drop-cast and spin-coat
films (Figure 5d–f),
which would correspond to their UV–vis spectra. Although the
intensities at 538 (or 539) nm in poly(3) seem higher
than those in poly(1) and poly(2), the observed
differences (shown in Figure 5b,c) are not so significant compared to that measured in THF
solution (Figure 5a).
Therefore, unique emission [increases in the higher vibronic bands
in poly(3)] was apparently observed not in the film but
in the diluted solution.

Time-Resolved Fluorescence
Spectra of Terthiophene Functionalized
Triarm Polymers
Steady-state fluorescence spectra of polymers
studied in this work depend on core fragments, in terms of relative
intensities of vibronic bands. Significantly intense higher vibronic
bands relative to the fluorescence (0, 0) band were observed in terthiophene
end-modified copolymers as well as block copolymers involving three-repeat
phenylenevinylene.78,81 Time-resolved fluorescence measurements
showed that these polymers exhibit time-dependent fluorescence spectra,
and the origin of the higher vibronic bands is basically species that
undergoes a structural distortion in the excited state. Figure 4 shows time-resolved fluorescence
spectra for poly(1–3). As expected,
relative intensities of emission vibronic bands change with delay
time from the laser excitation in all three polymers. For example,
in the spectrum for poly(1), at 150 ps, the (0, 0) band
has the highest intensity, whereas at 400 ps, the (0, 1) band is more
intense than the (0, 0) band. Similarly, for poly(2)
and poly(3), the relative intensities in the (0, 1) band
compared to the (0, 0) band increases as increasing the delay time
from the excitation pulse.

The observed time evolution can be
analyzed by assuming two different decay time constants in each polymer.
Decay profiles and detailed parameters for fitting are shown in Figure S4-1 and Table S3, Supporting Information,
respectively. It should be noted that in each polymer sample, decay
curve profiles depend on the monitored wavelength. For example, band
1 consists of almost a shorter lifetime component only, whereas band
4 is fitted with a single exponential function of a longer lifetime
component. Bands 2 and 3 are expressed as a linear combination of
two components, but the ratios are different between bands 2 and 3.
The obtained lifetimes (inverse of decay time constants) are listed
in Table 1. For all
three polymers, the component with a shorter lifetime (∼400
ps) that is assigned as a species should have a structure close to
the ground state, whereas the component with a longer lifetime (∼600
ps) can be ascribed to a species that undergoes structural distortion,
such as coplanarization of terthiophene groups, and shows more red-shifted
emission spectra.79 For all three polymers,
time dependence of fluorescence signal behaviors can be understood
basically with the same model as we reported previously.81 This argument was supported by the results of
time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy measurements (Figure S4-2).

However, careful inspection of Figure 6 reveals that relative
intensities of vibronic
bands are different among the three polymers. For example, at 150
ps delay, the intensities of bands 1 and 2 are much the same in poly(1) and poly (2), whereas the intensity of band
2 in poly(3) is obviously higher than that at band 1.
As described in the previous section, the steady-state fluorescence
spectra of poly(3) show a much higher (0, 1) fluorescence
band compared to those of poly(1) and poly(2). The observation for the time-resolved study well corresponds to
results for the steady-state measurements.

spectra for poly(1–3) in toluene

pulse (406 nm, full width at half-maximum = 70 ps). Vertical dotted
lines indicate vibronic bands named as bands 1–4.

Summary
Three types of terthiophene
(3T) modified conjugated triarm polymers
consisting of poly(9,9-di-n-octyl-fluorene-2,7-vinylene)
(PFV) arms (with the same PFV length) and different cores (Chart 2, TBP(PFV-3T)3 poly(1); TBB(PFV-3T)3 poly(2); and TPA(PFV-3T)3, poly(3)) have
been prepared according to our reported procedure for the synthesis
of poly(3) by combined olefin metathesis with Wittig
coupling.24 It has been demonstrated that
the degree of relative intensities at higher vibronic bands (at 496
and 527 nm, corresponding to 0–0 and 0–1 transitions,
respectively) of the fluorescence spectrum in poly(3)
in solution became higher than those in poly(1) and poly(2), whereas no significant differences were observed in their
UV–vis spectra. The relative intensities in the spectrum of
poly(3) were affected by the PFV length, but no significant
changes were observed in these (UV–vis, FL) spectra measured
at various temperatures (−5, 25, and 55 °C).

Chart 2 Excitation spectra in poly(3) in toluene have
no monitored
wavelength dependence, indicating that there is only one species that
absorbs light preceding emission. Moreover, no concentration dependences
were observed in the excitation and emission spectra, clearly indicating
no aggregation effects under these conditions. No significant differences
were observed in the spectra in thin films for poly(1–3), whereas the λmax values
red-shifted due to the formation of J-type aggregates.
Time-resolved fluorescence analysis reveals that, in the longer decay
component in the 3T end-functionalized PFV, an increase in intensities
at higher vibronic bands can be ascribed to a species of which π-system
of the excited PFV part is expanded over the end group after coplanarization
of the terthiophene unit upon the excitation. The observed difference
in the fluorescence spectrum for the polymer containing the TPA core,
poly(3), compared to those in the others [poly(1) and poly(2)] would be thus explained to be
due to an influence of the TPA core (probably due to improvement of
coplanarity under excited state) toward unique emission through 3T
(Chart 2). The characteristic
emission observed in poly(3) should be promising because
this could be explained as the effect of core segment in the star-shaped
conjugated polymers. This fact would be important for better understanding
and helpful for precise design of star-shaped conjugated polymers
for target applications.

Experimental Section
General Procedure
All experiments were carried out
under a nitrogen atmosphere in a vacuum atmosphere drybox or using
standard Schlenk technique unless otherwise noted. All chemicals used
were of reagent grades and were purified by the standard purification
procedures. Anhydrous-grade toluene (Kanto Chemical Co., Inc.), which
was transferred into a bottle containing molecular sieves (mixture
of 3A 1/16, 4A 1/8, and 13X 1/16) in the drybox, was stored over sodium/potassium
alloy and was used after passing through an alumina short column under
nitrogen flow prior to use. Anhydrous-grade THF and dichloromethane
(Kanto Chemical Co., Inc.) were also transferred into a bottle containing
molecular sieves in the drybox. Mo(CHCMe2Ph)(N-2,6-Me2C6H3)-[OCMe(CF3)2]2 (Mo) was prepared by the reported procedure,83 and RuCl2(PCy3)(IMesH2)-(CHPh) [Cy = cyclohexyl, IMesH2 = 1,3-bis(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)imidazolin-2-ylidene]
(Strem Chemicals, Inc.) was used in the drybox as received. Polymerization-grade
poly(9,9-di-n-octhyl-fluorene-2,7-vinylene) (PFV)
samples were prepared according to previous reports.58,76 Synthesis of terthiophene end-functionalized star (triarm) polymers,
TPA[PFV-3T]3 [poly(3)], was carried out according
to the reported procedure (method 2).24 2,2′:5′,2″-terthiophene-5-carboxaldehyde (3T-CHO,
Aldrich) was used as received. Tris(4-formylphenyl)amine [TPA(CHO)3, Aldrich] was used as received, and 2,4,6-tri(4′-formyl-biphenyl)benzene
[TBP(CHO)3]84 and 1,3,5-tri(2′-formylbenzyl)-benzene
[TBB(CHO)3]85 were prepared
according to previously reported procedures. Detailed procedures for
polymer synthesis including identifications are provided in the Supporting Information.

All 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV500
spectrometer (500.13 MHz for 1H NMR, 125.77 MHz for 13C NMR), and all chemical shifts are given in parts per million
and are referenced to SiMe4. Obvious multiplicities and
routine coupling constants are usually not listed, and all spectra
were obtained in the solvent indicated at 25 °C unless otherwise
noted. Molecular weights and the molecular weight distributions of
the resultant polymers were measured by gel permeation chromatography
(GPC). HPLC-grade THF was used for GPC and was degassed prior to use.
GPC analyses were performed at 40 °C on a Shimadzu SCL-10A using
a RID-10A detector (Shimadzu Co. Ltd.) in THF (containing 0.03 wt
% of 2,6-di-tert-butyl-p-cresol,
flow rate 1.0 mL/min). GPC columns (ShimPAC GPC-806, 804, and 802,
30 cm × 8.0 mm diameter, spherical porous gel made of styrene/divinylbenzene
copolymer, ranging from <102 to 2 × 107Mw) were calibrated versus polystyrene
standard samples. UV–vis spectra for the resultant polymers
were measured by using a Jasco V-550 UV–vis spectrophotometer
(concn 1.0 × 10–7 M in THF at 25 °C),
and the fluorescence spectra were measured by a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence
spectrophotometer (under absorbance 0.1 in THF at 25 °C). Steady-state
fluorescence spectra (in toluene) were measured on a JASCO FP6500
fluorescence photometer or a HORIBA FluoroMax 4 spectrophotomer, and
relative intensities of emission spectra were corrected by the spectrometer-supplied
methods. Fluorescence quantum yields of samples were obtained as described
previously.25,78 Time-resolved fluorescence measurements
were performed with the setup as described previously.25,78 To obtain florescence anisotropy ratios, excitation was performed
with the use of vertically polarized light. Emission from the sample
solution was collected after passing through a polarizer and then
led into the imaging spectrograph, of which the entrance is equipped
with a scrambler. Parallel and perpendicular emission signals versus
the excitation light were accumulated alternatively, and thus, the
obtained signals were used for the calculation of anisotropy ratios.
PFV films were prepared by drop-casting and spin-coating methods.
In the drop-casting method, 1.0 × 10–5 mol/L
PFV solution was dropped onto a quartz substrate placed in a Petri
dish. Then, the substrate was covered by the Petri dish and dried
gradually. After it was completely dry, the PFV solution was dropped
again onto the other side of the quartz substrate and dried by the
same procedure described above.

The calibration with
polystyrene standards often overestimates the molecular weight averages
of rigid conjugated polymers,21–28 GPC curves versus structurally
similar soluble PPP [poly(p-phenylene)] standards
were thus recorded,21–28 and the Mn values of rodlike polymers measured versus polymer standards are
overestimated by a factor of 1.6.58 For a related article on measuring Mn and Mw/Mn values by PPP standards. Marsitzky D. ; Brand T. ; Geerts Y. ; Klapper M. ; Müllen K.
