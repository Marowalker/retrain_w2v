Soft
luminescent materials have attracted much attention because
of their self-assembled and controllable properties. To explore their
facile and effective fabrication ways, we report here the self-assembling
of luminescent vesicles and lyotropic liquid crystals (LLCs) in a
protic ionic liquid, ethylammonium nitrate, by a partially amphiphilic
europium β-diketonate complex (Eu(III)) with a 1-dodecyl-3-methylimidazolium
cation as the counter ion. An interesting result came from the complex-induced
vesicle formation of corresponding amphiphile, 1-dodecyl-3-methylimidazolium
bromide ([C12mim]Br), which has been rarely reported in
the past. It was the interaction between the Eu(III) and imidazolium
group that changed the critical packing parameter of [C12mim]Br, which finally resulted in the occurrence of vesicles. The
obtained vesicle aggregates exhibited enhanced fluorescence intensity
and lifetime compared to those of Eu(III) solution. Meanwhile, a hexagonal
LLC phase with better fluorescence properties was found at higher
[C12mim]Br concentration. The obtained photophysical data
confirmed that the order degree of Eu(III)-containing aggregates could
effectively increase the energy transition efficiency of ligands.
The better luminescent properties of LLC resulted from the stronger
stabilizing and binding effects on Eu(III) in LLC than that in vesicles,
which might be caused by closer molecular packing in LLC. The results
presented here will not only expand the strategy of constructing lanthanide-containing
luminescent soft materials in ionic liquids but also provide reference
to better understand the effect of organized aggregates on luminescence
properties.

1 Introduction
Because
of its unique 4f electronic layer structure, the lanthanides
exhibit abundant properties like luminescence, electricity, magnetism,
and catalysis, which make them to be praised as “treasure house
of new materials”.1 Therefore, the
lanthanide-based luminescent materials have been paid much attention
and widely used in many fields, such as biological probes and information
display.2,3 To solve the problem of poor luminescence
efficiency and easy annihilation of lanthanide ions, the organic ligands
are often introduced to form complexes. Then, they could present excellent
luminescent properties because of the good antenna effect of ligands,
which could improve ligand-to-metal energy transfer or sensitization
of lanthanide ions luminescence.4 This
is also why the lanthanide β-diketonate complexes are much attractive
as high-performance luminescent materials because they display good
monochromaticity, long lifetimes, and high luminescence quantum yields.
However, their intrinsic defects like poor thermal stability or easily
degradable under UV irradiation may block their practical applications.
To overcome these difficulties, the luminescent hybrid materials by
immobilizing or dispersing the lanthanide complexes in certain matrices
through covalent or noncovalent interactions have realized some achievements,
especially for those in solid matrices.5,6 In addition,
the organized soft aggregates like vesicles, lyotropic liquid crystals
(LLCs), and gels have also become more and more recognized because
of their rich phase structures.7−9 As examples, an amphiphilic Tb3+ complex has been prepared by Liu et al. which could spontaneously
self-assemble into vesicles in water. The addition of adenosine triphosphate
could significantly amplify the luminescence intensity mainly because
of the replacement of water molecules to reduce fluorescence quenching.7 By introducing the europium complexes into an
amphiphilic block polymer-based LLC system, we observed their improved
luminescent properties because of the specially organized LLC micro-environment
and thus induced confinement effect.8 The
novel luminescent gels reported by Li et al., however, could be fabricated
via reaction of Eu3+-functionalized ionic liquids (ILs)
with imidazolium salts.9 Thus, the organized
soft aggregates exhibit good potential as matrices to fabricate lanthanide
hybrid luminescent materials.

To further improve the luminescence
performance and stabilities
of lanthanide complexes, the ILs have been chosen more and more as
ideal dispersion media because of their excellent properties such
as better thermal stability, nonvolatile, noninterference in the visible
and near-IR spectral regions.10−12 Meanwhile, ILs are also ideal
self-assembling media for organized aggregate fabrication. Therefore,
such dual benefits of ILs have promoted the construction of IL-based
lanthanide luminescent materials.13−15 By this motivation,
we have also prepared IL-based LLCs with doped lanthanide complexes,
which exhibited remarkably improved luminescence properties.16,17 However, in most studies for IL-based luminescent materials, the
lanthanide salts or complexes were just simply dispersed or doped,
which might limit their uses because of poor dispersibility or solubility
of dopants in matrices.18−24 Then, whether the lanthanide complexes could directly participate
the aggregate formation to increase their dispersion becomes a challenge.

For this aim, we herein report the synthesis and self-assembly
of a partially amphiphilic europium complex, 1-dodecyl-3-methylimidazolium
tetrakis(thenoyltrifluoroacetonato)europate ([C12mim][Eu(TTA)4], denoted as Eu(III)), which contains a hydrophobic long
alkyl chain and a hydrophilic alkylimidazolium cation, with an europium
β-diketonate complex as the counterion (see Scheme 1). Eu(III) was then co-assembled
with the corresponding amphiphilie, 1-dodecyl-3-methylimidazolium
bromide ([C12mim]Br), in a protic IL, ethylammonium nitrate
(EAN), to form organized aggregates. Here, EAN was employed as the
solvent owing to its rich hydrogen-bonded network similar to water,
which could offer driving forces for self-assembly.25 The vesicles and LLC aggregates with Eu(III) could be thus
obtained by adjusting [C12mim]Br concentration. To our
best knowledge, there are rarely studies on luminescent soft aggregates
from co-assembly of the lanthanide complex with corresponding amphiphilic
ligands. The effect of aggregate morphology on Eu(III) photophysical
properties have also been investigated. This will help us to further
understand the luminescence mechanism of lanthanide complexes in different
soft aggregates and expand their applications.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Phase Behavior of Self-Assembled
Eu[III] Aggregates
in EAN
We characterized first on the phase structure of aggregates
formed only by [C12mim]Br itself. As we know, the formation
of micelle of [C12mim]Br in aqueous solution has been observed
previously.26 Therefore, is it possible
to form the micelle also by [C12mim]Br in EAN? At lower
[C12mim]Br concentrations, C12 (<70 wt %), all samples were observed indeed to present as homogeneous,
transparent, and isotropic solutions. In addition, the dark-field
image of the sample under POM observation (see Figure S1a) and only a wide scattering peak in its small-angle
X-ray scattering (SAXS) curve (see Figure 1A) were both characteristic for micelle aggregates.27

Figure 1 SAXS patterns for the [C12mim]Br–EAN
binary system
at [C12mim]Br concentrations (wt %) low (A) or high (B).

With increasing C12 to high values
of about 70–90 wt %, however, the binary system formed a more
organized aggregate structure which displayed the obvious optical
birefringence and characteristic fan-like texture under POM for a
hexagonal (H1) phase (see Figure S1b). The SAXS curves in Figure 1B for samples at C12 of 75 or
85 wt % also exhibited three Bragg peaks with their relative scattering
factor (q) positions of 1:√3:2, which clearly
indicated the formation of the H1 phase. Therefore, the
preliminary phase diagram of the [C12mim]Br–EAN
binary system at 25 °C could be drawn in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Phase diagram of the [C12mim]Br–EAN
binary system
at 25 °C.

In order to study the
influence of Eu[III] on the phase structure
of aggregates, the SAXS patterns for samples of the [C12mim]Br–EAN–Eu[III] ternary system at different C12 values were measured with the results shown
in Figure 3. Interestingly,
from Figure 3A, for
SAXS curves measured at C12 of 50 or 60
wt %, two scattering peaks with their relative q ratio
of 1:2 could be seen, which indicated the appearance of a lamellar
phase.28 Compared to that only one scattering
peak being observed in the [C12mim]Br–EAN binary
system, the existence of Eu(III) should be the reason for such a phase
change. To obtain more aggregate information, freeze-fracture transmission
electron microscopy (FF-TEM) observation was applied with the typical
results shown in Figure 4. Many spherical polydisperse aggregates with their sizes ranging
from 50 to 200 nm could be observed. Therefore, the lamellar phase
indexing from SAXS might be originated from the formation of vesicles,
which existed at C12 from about 40–70
wt %.

Figure 3 SAXS patterns for the [C12mim]Br–Eu(III)–EAN
system at [C12mim]Br concentrations (wt %) low (A) or high
(B).

Figure 4 FF-TEM images of the aggregate formed from the
[C12mim]Br–Eu(III)–EAN
system at [C12mim]Br concentrations of 50 wt % and low
(A) or high (B) resolutions.

Then, how were the previous micelles in [C12mim]Br–EAN
binary system transformed into vesicles in the presence of the europium
complex? As a single-chain amphiphile, [C12mim]Br usually
forms micelles with its critical packing parameter (CPP) being about
0.23. However, Eu(III) could be considered as a quasi-amphiphile with
the same alkyl chain as [C12mim]Br but larger counter ion.
In their mixture samples, the solvophobic attraction between alkyl
chains made Eu(III) and [C12mim]Br packed shoulder to shoulder.
Meanwhile, the larger volume of the complex ion might reduce the electrostatic
repulsion between the imidazolium head group, which should increase
the CPP and therefore induce the vesicle formation.29

At C12 of about 70–90
wt %,
the SAXS curves in Figure 3B also exhibited three scattering peaks with q position ratios of 1:√3:2, reflecting the maintenance of
similar hexagonal liquid crystalline phase after adding Eu(III). With
the increase of C12, because of the closer
packing of alkyl chains from [C12mim]Br and Eu[III], and
also the relatively low ratio of Eu(III) to [C12mim]Br,
the LLC phase was little influenced. Compared to SAXS patterns in Figure 1B, the first scattering
peaks in Figure 3B
were found not to change even after adding Eu[III]. This was a sign
that no expansion occurred in LLC by Eu(III), indicating that the
europium complex ions were mainly distributed on the surface of the
columnar micelle and the solvent, similar to the situation discussed
before on their distribution for vesicle formation.

2.2 Luminescence Properties of [C12mim]Br–Eu(III)–EAN
Aggregates
The excitation
and emission spectra of the obtained vesicle and LLC samples were
measured to explore the aggregate structure effect on the luminescence
property of Eu(III). For comparison, we also mapped the fluorescence
spectra of the pure europium complex. Figure 5A illustrated the excitation spectra for
aggregates formed at different C12 and
for pure Eu(III). The broad bands from 200 to 450 nm could be seen
for all samples, which were because of the “energy absorption
via the TTA ligand”.30 In addition,
a small peak at 467 nm was observed for Eu(III) in the solid status,
corresponding to the intra-4f transition of Eu3+.31 This peak, however, disappeared when Eu(III)
was distributed in the vesicle and LLC aggregates, reflecting the
existence of a more efficient energy transfer process between TTA
and Eu3+ than that in the solid status.

Figure 5 Excitation (A) and emission
(B) spectra of [C12mim]Br–Eu(III)–EAN
samples in different aggregation status and Eu[III] solid.

From Figure 5A,
the main bands were found to locate around 340 nm, corresponding to
a charge transfer from ligand to metal charge transfer (LMCT), which
reflected the presence of an effective energy transfer in vesicle
or LLC aggregates.32 It could be observed
also that the excitation spectra were similar for aggregates with
the same phase structure, though at different C12. However, it was interesting to observe that the peak intensities
at 340 nm for LMCT were basically the same, but those at 275 nm for
the ligand to ligand charge transfer (LLCT) were obviously lower in
LLC than in the vesicle. Such a difference indicated a more efficient
energy transfer between the ligand and Eu3+ in H1, which was mainly due to the stronger binding effect in LLC.

From the emission spectra shown in Figure 5B, all samples could be seen to show five
narrow bands at 582, 595, 616, 652, and 705 nm, belonging respectively
to the characteristic Eu3+-centered transition bands 5D0 → 7FJ (J = 0–4).33 Among them, the strongest emission band at 616 nm corresponded to 5D0 → 7F2 hypersensitive
transition, which was the main reason for the red emission of samples.
As an electric-dipole transition, its intensity is closely related
to the coordination structure symmetry of central Eu3+.
However, the fluorescence intensity of band at 595 nm, corresponding
to 5D0 → 7F1 magnetic
dipole transition, is independent of coordination environment change.
Therefore, their transition intensity ratio of 5D0 → 7F2 to 5D0 → 7F1 (R) can be used as a measure
of coordination environment symmetry of Eu3+.34 Generally, a higher R value
represents a more asymmetric europium coordination sphere and therefore
a stronger interaction between Eu(III) and its host matrix in the
situation here.

Such R average values calculated
from Figure 5B were
listed in Table 1,
accompanying with
other fluorescence parameters for the [C12mim]Br–Eu(III)–EAN
vesicle or LLC aggregates and pure europium complex. It can be seen
that the R value obtained in LLC (12.53) was higher
than that from vesicle (11.33), indicating a higher asymmetry degree
of Eu(III) coordination sphere in LLC than in the vesicle. This result
could be easily understood because the hydrogen bond formed between
C–H from an imidazolium ring and C=O from a diketonate
group of TTA was the origin to make the distortion of the local symmetry
around the europium ions. The closer packing in LLC helped to form
a stronger hydrogen bond, and therefore, a higher coordination asymmetry
degree of the Eu(III). In addition, compared with the pure europium
complex, the R values in two aggregates were both
increased to exhibit improved luminescent monochromaticity because
of the increase of the coordination asymmetry degree.

Table 1 Characteristic Luminescence Parameters
for Eu(III) in Aggregate and Solid Status
status	R	τ (ms)	Q (%)	kr (ms–1)	knr (ms–1)	
LLC	12.53	0.535	48.51	0.917	1.055	
vesicle	11.33	0.436	29.29	0.672	1.622	
solid	7.05	0.953	46.63	0.489	0.561	
Other parameters in Table 1 were derived from the fluorescence
intensity decay curves
shown in Figure 6 for 5D0 → 7F2 emission
for all samples at room temperature. All curves could be fitted to
a single exponential function, which indicated only one coordination
environment of Eu3+ occupied in both LLC and vesicle phases.
Also, such observed single-exponential fluorescence decay lifetimes
(τ) indicated that Eu(III) did not decompose in these soft matrices.
Meanwhile, as seen in Table 1 and Figure S2, the average lifetimes
in both aggregates were higher than that of direct dispersion of Eu(III)
in EAN (τ = 0.191 ms) but lower than that of Eu(III) solid,
which was due to the high-energy vibrations from nitrate ions in EAN
to produce high nonradiative transition inactivation. Compared with
that in the vesicle, the Eu(III) complex had a longer fluorescence
lifetime in LLC, indicating a more obvious confinement effect in LLC.35 Also, the lifetime of all samples could be simply
compared by the intensity of red emission under UV irradiation (λmax = 365 nm) at room temperature (see Figure S3).

Figure 6 Luminescence decay curves of Eu(III) in aggregate samples
and the
solid status under excitation at 340 nm and observed at 616 nm at
room temperature.

Based on the emission
spectra and lifetime data, the radiative
(kr) and nonradiative (knr) rate constants and the internal emission quantum efficiency
(Q) of the 5D0 excited state
were determined (see the Supporting Information for details), with the results listed also in Table 1. Compared to the vesicle system, a higher kr and a lower knr values could be observed in the LLC sample. A higher Q value in LLC was therefore obtained. Such improved luminescent properties
in EAN-based LLC have been ascribed to decreased quenching by effective
binding and orderly dispersion of Eu(III).36 Then, only fewer nonradiative transitions were produced in LLC and
a better energy transfer efficiency was observed. The abovementioned
short fluorescence lifetime for Eu(III) dispersion in EAN, however,
further illustrated the role of effective confinement by organized
soft aggregates to luminescence enhancement.

2.3 Intermolecular
Forces between Eu(III) and
LLC or Vesicle Matrices
As a protic IL, a three-dimensional
hydrogen-bonding network structure similar to water can be formed
in EAN, which is also a key factor to promote surfactant self-assembly.37 Thus, whether the hydrogen bonding in EAN was
responsible for the effective confinement of Eu(III) should be clarified.
For this purpose, we used infrared spectroscopy to analyze the hydrogen
bonding effect both in the vesicle and in LLC phases.

Figure 7 exhibited the FTIR
spectra of EAN and [C12mim]Br–Eu(III)–EAN
vesicle and LLC samples. In spectra for both soft aggregates, the
stretching vibration at 3055 cm–1 and the asymmetric
deforming vibration at 1617 cm–1 of N–H bond
were shifted to the higher wavenumber region compared to those in
pure EAN. This tendency reflected that the presence of the imidazolium
cation led to the reconstruction of hydrogen bonding network of EAN
and the new hydrogen bond formation between atoms of N in the imidazole
head group and H in the ethylammonium cation.38 The changes of N–H stretch and asymmetric deformation vibrational
peaks were listed in Table 2, from which the largest shift was observed in the LLC sample,
implying the strongest stabilizing effect on Eu(III).

Figure 7 FTIR spectra for EAN
and [C12mim]Br–Eu(III)–EAN
vesicle and LLC materials.

Table 2 FTIR Band Assignments for Eu(III)
in Two Aggregates and Solid Status
EAN/cm–1	solid/cm–1	vesicle/cm–1	LLC/cm–1	assignment	
3055	 	3068	3079	N–H stretch	
1617	 	1625	1633	N–H asymmetric
deformation	
 	3170	3162	3155	C–H stretch	
Besides, the TTA ligands
could also form hydrogen bonds with the
imidazolium cations, which could be demonstrated by comparing C–H
stretching vibrations on the imidazole ring, which was shifted from
3170 in pure Eu(III) to 3162 in the vesicle and 3155 cm–1 in LLC. Such a shift to lower wavenumbers indicated that the imidazolium
cations were involved in the formation of hydrogen bonds, where the
hydrogen atom on the imidazole ring should act as a donor for hydrogen
bonds.39 In addition, the larger shift
in the LLC sample implied formation of stronger H-bonding.

Therefore,
the imidazolium cations might serve as the linker between
the Eu(III) and EAN solvent. The hydrogen bonding between EAN and
TTA ligands played a key role for constraining Eu(III) in aggregates.
The enhanced hydrogen bond interaction in LLC should be resulted from
the denser packing of [C12mim]Br molecules, which could
induce a more stable microchemical environment to reduce the nonradiative
transition deactivation of Eu(III) to improve the luminescent properties.40

2.4 Stability of [C12mim]Br–Eu(III)–EAN
LLC and the Vesicle
Usually, the emission intensity of lanthanide
complexes with β-diketonate could be strongly decreased under
UV irradiation because of the ligand dissociation. Then, how about
the luminescent stability in such fabricated LLC and vesicle? As a
comparison, Eu(III) was dissolved respectively in CH3CN
and EAN. Then, all prepared Eu(III)-containing luminescent materials
were exposed to UV light (6 W) at a wavelength of 365 nm to investigate
their UV-resistance. The measured emission intensity changes of 5D0 → 7F2 line under
UV light irradiation were plotted in Figure 8 for photostability study. It was shown that
the emission intensity was seriously reduced in CH3CN or
EAN solution upon UV irradiation as the exposure time increased. After
50 h, the intensity was declined to 22 or 50% of their initial values
in EAN or in CH3CN. In the vesicle and LLC samples, however,
the intensity attenuation was small. The 50 h exposure only made the
reduction of intensity to 74 or 94% of their initial values in the
vesicle or in LLC. The experimental results further confirmed that
luminescent materials constructed with ordered aggregates have excellent
UV light resistance even comparable to solid substrates.41

light exposure

3 Conclusions
In this
work, we have constructed two stable luminescent soft aggregates
in a protic IL (EAN) from europium β-diketonate complex [Eu(III)]
by molecular self-assembly. In particular, the partially amphiphilic
Eu(III) co-assembled with [C12mim]Br to induce successful
construction of vesicles. It was the hydrogen bonding between the
imidazolium cation or TTA ligand and EAN that constrain Eu(III) distribution
relatively homogeneous in aggregate matrices. Thus, the obtained luminescent
vesicle and hexagonal LLC both exhibited excellent luminescent property
and stability. Because of the stronger hydrogen bonding effect in
LLC and thus induced more ordered microenvironment, higher quantum
yield and lifetime were observed. Therefore, using soft aggregate
as matrices is an effective way to enhance the luminescence efficiency
of the lanthanide, which might expand their applications in the monitor
and detection metal ions in medicine.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials
EuCl3·6H2O (99.9%) and 2-thenoyltrifluoroacetone (99%) were purchased
from Alfa Aesar and used as received. [C12mim]Br was purchased
from the center for Green Chemistry and Catalysis, LICP, CAS. EAN
was prepared according to the procedures reported previously.42 A portion of 3 M nitric acid was added to a
concentrated solution of ethylamine while stirring and cooling it
in an ice bath. The product was evaporated at 50 °C under vacuum
to remove most of water and excess ethylamine. Then, the residue was
dried at 50 °C under vacuum for 24 h, which was finally freeze-dried
for 24 h until the residual water content was below 0.5 wt %, as determined
by Karl Fischer titration. 1H NMR, δ (300 MHz, D2O): 1.15 (t, 3H), 2.89 (m, 2H).

4.2 Synthesis
of Europium β-Diketonate Complex
The europium complex,
Eu[III], was prepared according to the procedures
previously reported.43 First, 6 mmol 2-thenoyltrifluoroacetone
was dissolved in 10 mL ethanol, which was deprotonated by 1 M NaOH
aqueous solution. Then, 1.5 mmol [C12mim]Br (dissolved
in 9 mL ethanol) was added dropwise and the mixture was stirred at
50 °C for 0.5 h. After that, the solution with 1 mmol EuCl3·6H2O dissolved in 10 mL water was added dropwise
and the mixture was stirred at 50 °C for 2 h. A precipitate was
formed and the reaction was then cooled down to room temperature overnight.
The product was filtered and carefully washed with ice water. The
obtained light yellow powder was dried in a vacuum oven at 50 °C
for 48 h and stored in a dry and dark place. The complex composition
was characterized by the elemental (C, H, N) analysis with the result
measured (calculated) as follows (%): C48H51N2F12O8S4·Eu: C,
44.70 (44.51); H, 3.95 (3.76); N, 2.17 (2.16); S, 9.94 (9.95).

4.3 Preparation of the Aggregate Sample
For a typical Eu[III]-participated
aggregate sample preparation,
5 mg of europium complex was first dissolved in EAN. Then, the exact
amount of [C12mim]Br was mixed with this Eu[III]-containing
IL. The final volume of each obtained sample at different [C12mim]Br weight percentages was kept at 1 mL to keep the same Eu[III]
concentration in all samples. These mixtures were homogenized by repeated
vortex mixing and centrifugation. Then, they were equilibrated at
25 ± 0.1 °C for four weeks in the darkness before further
investigation. For comparison, the Eu[III]-dissolved EAN solution
at the same concentration was prepared.

4.4 Characterization
4.4.1 Optical Microscopy
In order to
identify the LLC phase, the sample birefringent textures were recorded
by a Motic B2 polarized optical microscope (POM) with a charge-coupled
device camera (Panasonic Super Dynamic II WV-CP460).

4.4.2 Small-Angle X-ray Scattering
SAXS
measurements for aggregate samples were performed on a SAXSess MC2
high flux SAXS instrument (Anton Paar, Austrian) with a Ni-filtered
Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm), operating at 40 kV and
50 mA. The distance from the sample to the detector was 27.8 cm. The
temperature for all samples was controlled at 25 °C and the test
time was 15 min.

4.4.3 Fluorescence Spectroscopy
The excitation
and emission spectra were measured on a Hitachi F-7000 spectrofluorometer
equipped with a xenon lamp (150 W). The luminescence lifetime was
measured on an Edinburgh Instruments FLS920 luminescence spectrometer
(xenon lamp, 450 W). The luminescence lifetime was measured by monitoring
the luminescence intensity decay at the 5D0 → 7F2 transition of Eu3+. The absolute
value error of lifetime was about 0.3 μs.

4.4.4 Fourier Transformed Infrared Spectroscopy
FTIR spectra
were measured by an ALPHA-T spectrometer (Bruker)
with a resolution of 4 cm–1 from 400 to 4000 cm–1. The solid powders were mixed with KBr salt and then
compressed into a transparent plate. The LLC or neat IL solution was
coated on KBr plates.

4.4.5 Freeze-Fracture Transmission
Electron Microscopy
(FF-TEM)
To observe Eu(III) aggregate morphology in the solution,
the sample was mounted on a specimen holder and frozen by quickly
inserting into liquid ethane cooled by liquid nitrogen. Fracturing
and replication were carried out on a freeze-fracture apparatus (EM
BAF 060, Leica, Germany). The replicas were transferred onto the copper
grid and then observed with a Hitachi 100CX-II operating at 100 kV.
