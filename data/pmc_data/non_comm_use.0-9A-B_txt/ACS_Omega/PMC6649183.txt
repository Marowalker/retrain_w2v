1 Introduction
Development
of efficient blue emitters with balanced carrier injection
as well as transporting characteristics in organic light-emitting
devices (OLEDs) remains a challenging task1−5 because the higher energy gap (Eg) results in low electron affinities, thereby lowering
the efficiency.6−9 Phenanthroimidazoles have been reported as an excellent building
block to harvest higher efficiency.10 Though
nondoped blue devices based on the dipyrenylbenzene emitter (CIE:
0.15, 0.11) and anthracene derivative (CIE: 0.14, 0.12) show high
external quantum efficiencies (ηex) of 5.2 and 5.3%,
respectively, their power (ηp) and current (ηc) efficiencies are low because of wide band gap (Eg). The large band gap impedes injection of charge carriers
to the emissive layer (EML).11,12 A blue device with
an oligoquinoline EML13 (CIE: 0.15, 0.16)
shows high ηp (power efficiency) and ηex (external quantum efficiency). The simple structured device
based on the bis(phenanthroimidazolyl)biphenyl derivative exhibits
higher performance (CIE y-0.15; ηex: 6.31%) than multilayered devices because of large electron injection
barrier.14,15 Because cyano substitution could limit the
ability to transport hole to adjust carrier injection, it is aimed
to incorporate the cyanonaphthyl at side capping of the phenanthrimidazole
ring.16,17

Thermally activated delayed fluorescence
(TADF),3,18 hybridized
local and charge-transfer (HLCT),19 and
triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA: ηint of
62.5%)20−24 in fluorescent OLEDs enhanced the internal quantum efficiency (ηint) because of small ΔEST (singlet–triplet energy splitting) in reverse intersystem
crossing (RISC) (Scheme 1).25−29 The donor–spacer–acceptor (D−π–A)
compounds with HLCT show high exciton utilization efficiency (ηS), and this is attributed to the hot exciton model.30−32 The ηex and ηS are obtained using
ηEQE = ηIQE × ηout = ηout × ηS × ηPL × ηrec and [ηS =
ηrec × ηPL × ηout/ηEL], respectively (Scheme 1).33 The LE predominate
HLCT affords high ηPL, and predominate CT in HLCT
is the cause for small ΔEST.34 The bipolar phenanthrimidazoles are excellent
pure blue-emissive materials.35−42 Here, we present a novel method to develop cyano-substituted blue-emitting
molecules, namely, 4,4′-bis(1-(4-naphthyl)-1H-phenanthro[9,10-d]imidazol-2-yl)binaphthyl (NPIBN),
4,4′-bis(1-(4-cyanonaphthyl)-1H-phenanthro[9,10-d]imidazol-2-yl)biphenyl (CNPIBP), and 4,4′-bis(1-(4-cyanonaphthyl)-1H-phenanthro[9,10-d]imidazol-2-yl)binaphthyl
(CNPIBN) for highly efficient fluorescent devices for doped and nondoped
devices. The HLCT emitters consisting of a strong donor in 4-(2-(5-(4-(diphenylamino)phenyl)thiophen-2-yl)-1H-phenanthro[9,10-d]imidazol-1-yl)naphthalene-1-carbonitrile
(TPNCN-TPA) and a weak donor in 4-(2-(5-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-1H-phenanthro[9,10-d]imidazol-1-yl)naphthalene-1-carbonitrile
(TPNCN-Cz) have also been reported. The Cz in TPNCN-Cz decreases the
CT and increases LE in S1 HLCT, which provides low ΔEST with high ϕPL (photoluminescence
quantum yield). The ηPL of TPNCN-Cz is higher compared
to TPNCN-TPA. The combination effect of ηPL and ηS increases the ηEQE of TPNCN-Cz.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Molecular Design
The synthetic route
of bis phenanthroimidazole derivatives, namely, NPIBN, 4,4′-CNPIBP,
and 4,4′-CNPIBN, and donor–acceptor derivatives, TPNCN-TPA
and TPNCN-Cz are presented in Scheme 2. The key intermediates, 2-(1-bromonaphthalen-4-yl)-1-(naphthalen-1-yl)-1H-phenanthro[9,10-d]imidazole (BNNPI),
4-(2-(4-bromophenyl)-1H-phenanthro[9,10-d]imidazol-1-yl)naphthalene-1-carbonitrile (BPINCN), 4-(2-(1-bromonaphthalen-4-yl)-1H-phenanthro[9,10-d]imidazol-1-yl)naphthalene-1-carbonitrile
(BNPINCN), and 4-(2-(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-1H-phenanthro[9,10-d]imidazol-1-yl)naphthalene-1-carbonitrile (BTPINCN) have
been synthesized with yield of 65–70%. The bis phenanthrimidazole
derivatives, namely, NPIBN, CNPIBP, and CNPIBN were prepared from
the intermediates BNNPI, BPINCN, and BNPINCN, respectively, by homocoupling
reaction (100 °C, 24 h). The bromo intermediate BTPINCN on reaction
with diphenylaminophenyl boronic acid [Pd(PPh3)4, Na2CO3, toluene: ethanol for 18 h] or 9H-carbazole (CuI, K2CO3, 18-crown-6
for 18 h) yielded TPNCN-TPA and TPNCN-Cz, respectively. The bromo
intermediates (BPINCN, BNPINCN, and BTPINCN), bis phenanthrimidazoles
(NPIBN, CNPIBP, and CNPIBN), and donor−π–acceptor
compounds (TPNCN-TPA and TPNCN-Cz) were characterized by NMR (1H & 13C), mass spectrometry, and elemental
analysis, respectively.

TPNCN-TPA, and TPNCN-Cz
2.2 Potential Energy Scan
The optimization
of ground (S0) as well as excited (S1) geometries
of bis phenanthrimidazoles and D−π–A compounds
was performed using Gaussian-09 (Figure 1). The central biphenyl moiety in CNPIBP
and CNPIBP and binaphthyl in CNPIBN takes up coplanar configuration
with torsion angles 7.2°, 6.9°, and 5.8°, respectively.
The inter ring torsion angle is an important parameter which reduces
the π–π stacking interaction in the film, and hence,
fluorescence quenching was lowered because of aggregation. At angles
of 5.8°–7.2°, the conjugation is lowered, thereby
increasing the charge transfer which is reflected in solvatochromic
investigation. The side-capping cyanonaphthyl group is twisted to
a large extent over the phenanthrimidazole ring and the dihedral angles
are 85.1° (CNPIBP), 86.5° (NPIBN), and 84.5° (CNPIBN).
In bis phenanthrimidazoles, there are three key twist angles (θ°),
namely, N-θ° (between the phenanthrimidazole plane and
cyanonaphthyl attached to imidazole nitrogen), C-θ° (between
the phenanthrimidazole plane and the bibhenyl/binaphthyl bridge attached
to imidazole carbon), and B-θ° (between two biphenyl/binaphthyl
centers) which play a key role in the overlap of the highest occupied
molecular orbital (HOMO)–lowest unoccupied molecular orbital
(LUMO) MOs in ground as well as excited states (Figure 1). The ground-state energy results by a potential
energy scan reveal that N-θ° is limited at room temperature
(kBT, 12.5 meV) (CNPIBP—100.6°–118.1°:
NPIBN—50.0°–120.0°: CNPIBN—50.0°–130.0°);
C-θ° (99.0°–130.1°); B-θ° (CNPIBP—88.7°–128.5°;
CNPIBN—100.0°–130.0°) and increases sharply
when the twist angle goes out of the range (Figure 2a). Hence, the extent of conjugation was
restricted and wave function of the two phenanthrimidazoles shows
a comparatively minimized overlap of biphenyl/binaphthyl spacer and
the location of C-θ°—230° (NPIBN) and B-θ°—40.0°
(NPIBN) providing large electron overlap among the biphenyl/binaphthyl
bridge at C2 and phenanthrimidazole.43 The
incorporation of the cyanonaphthyl group in the phenanthrimidazole
unit increases the charge transfer state; as a result, the efficient
reverse intersystem crossing process would be facilitated to enhance
the fraction of singlet generation.43 Biphenyl
(CNPIBP) and binaphthyl (CNPIBN) between two phenanthrimidazole groups
in the backbone enhanced the horizontal locally excited state to balance
the CT component, resulting in high photoluminescence quantum yield
(Φs/f).44 Clipping the
linkage between the two phenanthrimidazole planes by biphenyl or binaphthyl
is beneficial to suppress the aggregation effect to maintain the color
purity of OLEDs. In D−π–A materials, ground state
(S0) geometry, naphthonitrile part (θ1), as well as thiophene moiety (θ2) are largely
twisted over phenanthrimidazole. The dihedral angles are 58.1°
(θ1) and 26.9° (θ2) for TPNCN-TPA
and 50.2° (θ1) and 22.72° (θ2) for TPNCN-Cz. The TPA of TPNCN-TPA and Cz of TPNCN-Cz are
twisted, and the dihedral angles are 160.2° and 169.1°,
respectively.45 The large twist angles
of rigid TPNCN-Cz is due to a strong repulsive interaction of the
two hydrogens of carbazole with hydrogens of the binaphthyl ring.
The twist angles (θ2) of excited TPNCN-Cz and TPNCN-TPA
are increased (38.6° and 28.0°) on comparison to the twist
angle of S0. In the same way, the excited state twist angle
(θ1) was small for TPNCN-Cz (68.9°) and TPNCN-TPA
(60.2°). The TPNCN-Cz and TPNCN-TPA bond lengths (R1) are increased (0.03 and 0.07 Å, respectively)
on moving from ground (S0) to excited states (S1). On switching from ground (S0) to excited (S0) state geometry; small structural modification of TPNCN-Cz increases
the photoluminescence efficiency (ηPL).46−49 These orthogonal dihedral angles confirmed the noncoplanar twisting
conformation of NPIBN, CNPIBP, CNPIBN, TPNCN-TPA, and TPNCN-Cz which
suppresses the red shift and harvested high ηex in
the film by restraining the intermolecular interaction.46−49

2.3 Thermal
and Electrochemical Properties
Thermal characteristics of
bis phenanthroimidazoles and donor–spacer–acceptor
molecules were studied using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) as well
as differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) techniques. The incorporation
of a highly rigid bulky moiety at imidazole carbon and side capping
at imidazole nitrogen enlarged the size and improved their thermal
stability which is required for efficient devices (Table 1; Figure 3). All materials show high thermal stability.
Their 5% weight-loss temperature (Td)
ranges from 430 to 556 °C (CNPIBP—540 °C, NPIBN—520
°C, CNPIBN—556 °C, TPNCN-Cz—448 °C, TPNCN-TPA—430
°C). Such high Tg as well as Td shows that the amorphous layers of these compounds
can be fabricated by vacuum thermal evaporation technology. In addition,
the said materials are expected to exhibit high morphological stability
which is desirable for OLEDs.9e High Td reveals that the said materials are suitable
for device fabrication. Further, all the materials show high Tg at 239–241 °C, showing improved
morphological stability because of a rigid phenanthrimidazole core.
The higher Tg implicates a stable film
on thermal evaporation and reduces the likelihood of phase separation
on heating, enhancing the device lifetime and so forth among the donor–spacer–acceptor
compounds, TPNCN-Cz exhibits higher thermal stability (Tg −161 and Td −448
°C) compared to TPNCN-TPA 156 (Tg) and 430 °C (Td) (Figure 3): stronger rigidity is likely
to be a reason for the observed results. The improved Tg is because of the C–N···H/C–N···π
interaction of the cyano group with the phenanthrimidazole core. This
induces molecular packing in the film. The thermal morphological stability
of the thin film of these compounds was studied using atomic force
microscopy (AFM) at about 30 and 90 °C (12 h). The rms roughness
values of NPIBN-0.20 nm, CNPIBP-0.25 nm, CNPIBN-0.21 nm, TPNCN-TPA-0.27
nm, and TPNCN-Cz-0.23 nm film surfaces reveal the absence of remarkable
modifications before and after annealing. This supports the adoptability
of these molecules for fabrication (Figure 3). The injection of holes in the interface
between the layers in OLEDs is essential for the efficient functioning
of devices: shallow EHOMO of EML enhances
the hole injection in OLEDs. The frontier energies of emissive material
have been examined from redox potentials measured from potential versus
current plot (Figure 3). From the onset potentials (oxidation) of NPIBN-0.70 V/CNPIBP-0.68
V/CNPIBN-0.72 V, the EHOMO of −5.50
eV (NPIBN), −5.48 eV (CNPIBP), and −5.52 eV (CNPIBN)
have been calculated.50 The calculated ELUMO (EHOMO –
1239/λonset) −2.48 eV (NPIBN), −2.39
eV (CNPIBP), and −2.42 eV (CNPIBN) are approximately of the
same value of TPBi. This supports the ability of electron injection
by bis phenanthrimidazoles CNPIBP, CNPIBN, and CNPIBP. The HOMO is
mainly located on cyanonaphthyl with the biphenyl bridge in NPIBN
and cyanonaphthyl and with the binaphthyl bridge in CNPIBP and CNPIBN,
whereas the LUMO is located on the imidazole core with the biphenyl
bridge in NPIBN and the imidazole ring and with the binaphthyl bridge
in CNPIBP and CNPIBN (Figure 4): separation of charges in these molecules benefit injection
of charges from electrodes. Partial overlap of HOMO–LUMO on
the phenanthrimidazole ring supports the charge transfer from the
π-linked biphenylphenanthrimidazole/binaphthylphenanthrimidazole
group to the cyanonaphthyl moiety, and the long π-linkers are
beneficial to enhance the quantum yield. The calculated radiative
(kr) and nonradiative (knr) decay constants are (kr/knr) 4.0/2.1 ns (NPIBN); 4.4/0.8 ns
(CNPIBP), and 4.5/0.5 ns (CNPIBN) (Figure 3). The radiative rate was increased for binaphthyl-bridged
CNPIBP and CNPIBN with a simultaneous decreasing nonradiative rate
on comparison with biphenyl-bridged NPIBN. The HOMO orbital is distributed
over triphenylamine in TPNCN-TPA (EHOMO = −5.30 eV) and carbazole in TPNCN-Cz (EHOMO = −5.35 eV), whereas the LUMO orbital localized
on the cyanonaphthyl fragment at the nitrogen atom (ELUMO = −2.56 eV TPNCN-TPA; −2.62 eV TPNCN-Cz)
(Figure 4). The HOMO
and LUMO of D−π–A compounds display adequate separation
features, and the differences are quite small which benefits hole
as well as electron transportation (bipolar properties); this lowers
singlet–triplet splitting (ΔST).50 Hence, the HOMO and LUMO moieties individually
undertake the electron and hole transport functions. The calculated
electron/hole transfer integrals of TPNCN-Cz (0.25/0.42 eV) and TPNCN-TPA
(0.24/0.50 eV) reveal that these materials are bipolar materials.
These molecules show both redox potentials indicating their charge
transport abilities.

2.4 Photophysical Properties and HLCT Character
The optical
characteristics of emissive materials were studied
in solution as well as solid by absorption and emission studies (Figure S1: Table 1). When the cyano group is incorporated, the modification
in the CT state will cause red-shifted absorption and emission.16 The strong absorption at ∼250 nm due
to π–π* transition originates from the phenyl ring
to the imidazole ring. In addition, the absorption at 300–340
nm is attributed to intramolecular CT from the donor to acceptor unit.51 Compared with parent compounds bis phenanthrimidazoles
(NPIBN, CNPIBP, and CNPIBN), D−π–A materials (TPNCN-TPA
and TPNCN-Cz) show larger absorption intensity. This is ascribed to
the newly generated CT owing to conjugation among the donors (triphenylamine
or carbazole) and acceptor (phenanthroimidazole) as the donor moieties
attached to the para carbon of thiaphenyl phenanthroimidazole.51 New-born emitters exhibit similar absorption
(sol/film) 254 (εmax = 39 370 cm–1 M–1), 308/252, 316 (TPNCN-TPA), and 250 (εmax = 40 000 cm–1 M–1), 301/246, 295 nm (TPNCN-Cz) because the core fragment is not different.
The absorption from 301 and 308 nm is due to intramolecular charge
transfer52,53 from the donor (carbazole/triphenylamine)
to acceptor (phenanthrimidazole). The intramolecular charge transfer
is further confirmed by molecular electrostatic potential (Figure 4). Compared with
solution, the small red shift shown by the film shows suppression
of π–π* stacking.54 The
emission of NPIBN, CNPIBP, and CNPIBN is observed at 435, 442, and
438 nm, respectively, in solid [full width half-maximum (fwhm) ≈
30 nm], the red shift is unlikely due to aggregation but may be because
of excited-state configurational change.9 The incorporated −CN group rarely influences the electronic
properties as well as band gap. It is in accordance with quantum chemical
calculations. The phenanthroimidazole derivatives NPIBN, CNPIBP, CNPIBN,
TPNCN-TPA, and TPNCN-Cz show blue emission at 428, 430, 425, 408,
and 400 nm, respectively (Figure S1), and
the emission peak is red-shifted because of increase of solvent polarity
(Figure S2). This variation is because
of polarization-induced optical shift.55 The calculated singlet energy/triplet energy (ES/ET) of NPIBN (2.7/2.3 eV),
CNPIBP (2.8/2.3 eV), and CNPIBN (2.9/2.3 eV) shows that they have
high triplet energy to sensitize phosphorescent dopants with ET below 2.3 eV. The PL spectra gradually widened
and their peaks show red shift with increase of solvent polarity which
indicates that their excited state have strong CT character when compared
to the ground state and further stabilized by polar solvents. Compared
to TPNCN-TPA, TPNCN-Cz shows higher blue shift of absorption as well
as emission. This is ascribed to low-electron donation of Cz compared
to TPA. The increased % LE along with decreased % CT in S1 HLCT is probably the reason for the observed blue shift. The FWHM
of the absorption peak of TPNCN-Cz (30 nm) is reduced compared to
TPNCN-TPA (42 nm). This result shows decrease of % CT of TPNCN-Cz
in S1 which is in accordance with natural-transition orbitals
(NTO) analysis (S0 → S1 transition).
The emission peak of TPNCN-TPA as well as TPNCN-Cz gives blue shift
compared to parent molecules. This is contradictory to the widely
observed red shift due to π-conjugation.56 The overlap of UV with PL spectra is due to the increased
% LE in TPNCN-TPA and TPNCN-Cz compared to their parent molecules.
The TPNCN-Cz shows solvatochromic smaller red shift in emission (32
nm) compared to that of TPNCN-TPA (56 nm) (Figure S2: Tables S1 and S2). In the same
way, a small absorption red shift viz., 20 and 28 nm, is observed
for TPNCN-Cz and TPNCN-TPA (Figure S3: Tables S1 and S2). Solvatochromic shifts57,58 confirmed that low-lying S1 excited state must possesses
CT character. The CT % in S1 state of TPNCN-Cz is less than TPNCN-TPA,
whereas LE % of TPNCN-Cz is larger than TPNCN-TPA (Table S3). In S0 → S1 and S0 → S2 transitions, the HLCT was composed
of the CT state followed by the LE state and exhibited larger oscillator
strength [fS0–S1/fS0–S2 = 0.6814/0.6712 (TPNCN-Cz—Figure S4): 0.3792/0.3673 (TPNCN-TPA—Figure 5)] compared with other S0–Sn transitions. This is because of larger LE
% in HLCT (Table 2—TPNCN-Cz
and Table 3—TPNCN-TPA)
which is necessary for higher efficiency OLEDs.59 The hole as well as particle of S0 →
S1 and S0 → S2 transitions
in TPNCN-Cz and TPNCN-TPA consist of two different configurations
with comparable contributions: C2 direction
takes up one and N1 direction takes up
other: LE and HLCT states have one squint each (Figure S1). This implies that these compounds show a well-mixed
CT and LE. In D−π–A molecules, CT and LE components
are mutually perpendicular in HLCT. This mixed state leads to lowering
of oscillator strengths in TPNCN-TPA, (fS0–S1—0.3792) than that of TPNCN-Cz (fS0–S1—0.6814)
with small energy of transition (0.04 eV) from S1 to S4. This transition among the excited states suppresses nonradiative
decay, increasing both the efficiency of photoluminescence and oscillator
strength. This is supported by optical studies.

2.5 Solvatochromism for HLCT Character
From the Lipper–Mataga plot (SI-I; Figure S1, Tables S1 and S2), the dipole moment of the S0 (μg) state of TPNCN-Cz and TPNCN-TPA could be estimated as 5.0
and 6.34 D in low-polar solvents. This is ascribed to LE transition
and μe in high polar solvents is 22.9 and 24.1 D,
respectively.57 The large μe in high polar solvent is close to μe of the CT
molecule, DMABN (23.0 D).59 This indicates
the domination of CT and LE in more and less polar solvents, respectively,
and mixed LE and CT contribution in medium polar solvents. A potential
energy scan of TPNCN-Cz and TPNCN-TPA excited state shows that the
S1 state remained unchanged with increasing solvent polarity,
whereas the S3 state decreased to intercross with the S1 state at moderate polarity and to be much lower than the
S1 state at high polarity (Figure 2b,c). This shows that HLCT is only emissive
state in TPNCN-Cz and TPNCN-TPA. The f of TPNCN-Cz
(0.6814, Table 2) is
larger than TPNCN-TPA (0.3792, Table 3) which yields larger PL efficiency (ηPL) of TPNCN-Cz. Molecular modification from TPA to Cz increases LE
% in HLCT and improves ηPL of TPNCN-Cz. To supplement
experimental observations, DFT and Multiwfn calculations were made
to probe excited-state characteristics. NTO (Figure 5 TPNCN-TPA and TPNCN-Cz—Figure S4; Tables 2 and 3), hole particle distribution
(Figure S5; Table S4—TPNCN-Cz; Figure S6; Table S5—TPNCN-TPA), transition density
matrix (TDM) TPNCN-Cz and TPNCN-TPA: Figure 6-TPNCN-Cz and Figure S7-TPNCN-TPA), root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), H and t indexes, centroid of hole (h+) and electron (e–), excitation
energy (eV), Δr intex, hole (h+) and electron (e–) overlap,
charge transfer and dipole moment, and so forth are displayed in Tables 4, S4–S9 and Figures 5, 6, S4–S8 and discussed in SI-II. The density of
overlap among the particle and hole depends upon the configuration
of donor–acceptor architecture, and the magnitude of overlap
intensity tuned the % LE and % CT in S1 state.

2.6 Quasi-Equivalent Hybridization
The
excited states (S1 and S2) of TPNCN-Cz and TPNCN-TPA
show a hybrid-splitting character because of interstate-coupling of
CT and LE to form HLCT (Figure 4: Tables 2 and 3). This interstate hybridization-coupling of positive
and negative combination of CT with LE wave functions are shown in
the equation: ΨS1/S2 = cLE·ΨLE ± cCT·ΨCT. The CT of TPNCN-Cz
(60%) is lower than TPNCN-TPA (90%) because of poor donor capacity
of Cz compared to TPA [TPNCN-Cz (LE ≈ 40%) and TPNCN-TPA (LE
≈ 10%)] (Table S3). Hence, TPNCN-Cz
is expected to show larger photoluminescence efficiency (ηPL) and blue-shift the emission compared to TPNCN-TPA. Thus,
both S1 and S2 are to be taken as the hybrid
state because of the CN group in TPNCN-Cz and TPNCN-TPA.10 The S1 and S2 are approximately
of same energy (E), oscillator strength (f), and hole particle distribution (Tables 2 and 3). This suggests
a quasi-equivalent hybridization among CT and LE. In contrast, in
nonequivalent hybridization, the S1 and S2 have
different energies, fo and so forth, and
quasi-equivalent hybridization provides high ηPL as
well as high ηs and EL efficiencies because of comparable
CT % and LE % in HLCT (Figure S9). The
formation of the HLCT state is analyzed using energies of excitation
of CT and LE states. A wide band gap between T2 and T1 of TPNCN-Cz (1.23 eV) and TPNCN-TPA (0.56 eV) stems from
phenanthrimidazole (acceptor). The Eg of
TPNCN-Cz (Table 2)
is wider than that of TPNCN-TPA (Table 3).60,61 A small ΔEST ≈ 0 (ES1 – ET2) favors RISC
(T2 → S1) because of HLCT’s nature.
As a result of increased LE % in S1 of TPNCN-Cz high photoluminescence
efficiency (ηPL), high exciton utilization efficiency
(ηS) and high external quantum efficiency (ηex) have been harvested compared to TPNCN-TPA. The LE % and
CT % in HLCT tuned the PL and EL of the film: higher CT % enhances
ηS by RISC because of small ΔEST and lowers ηPL. Hence, modulation
of excited state composition is employed by using different components
in the D−π–A molecules with the biphenyl/binaphthyl
bridge to achieve high ηPL (<LE %) and high ηS (<CT %) in HLCT which leads to quasi-equivalent hybridization.
Efficient quasi-equivalent hybridization depends on both ELE – ECT band gap and
interstate-coupling strength.62 In TPNCN-Cz
and TPNCN-TPA, the ELE< ECT and band gap (ES2 – ES1) is small relative
to parent compounds and leads to quasi-hybridization. In TPNCN-Cz,
the ES2 – ES1 is reduced more when compared with TPNCN-TPA;
hence, the effective quasi-equivalent hybridization enhances OLED
efficiency. The calculated LE % and CT % are displayed in Table S3 which shows HLCT, LE, and CT contributions
to quasi-equivalent hybridization. The HLCT contribution is discussed
from the electron–hole pair wave function (Figure S5—TPNCN-Cz; Figure S6—TPNCN-TPA) as well as the TDM (Figure 6—TPNCN-Cz; Figure S7—TPNCN-TPA): the diagonal part corresponds to LE which
is situated on the main core, whereas the off-diagonal part corresponds
to CT; excitation transferred the electron from the donor region to
acceptor vicinity depending upon the electronic coupling which is
investigated by distribution of electron density (S0 to
S10 states). The new-born blue emitters show high quantum
yield (s/f) of CNPIBP (0.85/0.76), NPIBN (0.75/0.68), CNPIBN (0.90/0.88),
TPNCN-TPA (0.71/0.62), and TPNCN-Cz (0.78/0.72), and high fluorescence
efficiencies are essential for efficient OLEDs (Table 1). The higher quantum yield is ascribed to
the suppressed nonradiative emission because of molecular interactions,
viz., intermolecular interaction between the cyano group and the phenanthrimidazole
plane.63 Incorporation of cyanonaphthyl
and biphenyl/binaphthyl into bulky phenanthrimidazole enhanced the
intermolecular steric hindrance and forced the molecule to form a
more twisted structure when packing in solid which results in less
aggregation and lower quantum yield in the solid state. The harvested
high ϕ and unchanged PL emission resulted from the various components
and the CN group at a suitable position of D−π–A
molecules is considered as a potential rare model in OLEDs.

2.7 Single-Carrier Devices
The charge
injection as well as transport capacity of TPNCN-Cz, TPNCN-TPA, CNPIBN,
4,4′-bis(carbazol-9-yl)biphenyl (CBP):Ir(ppy)3,
TPNCN-TPA:Ir(ppy)3, and TPNCN-Cz:Ir(ppy)3 was
investigated by fabrication of single-carrier devices [hole-only (h+) and electron-only (e–)]. Hole-only (h+): (I) ITO/HATCN(8
nm)/CNPIBN/TPNCN-TPA/TPNCN-Cz (50 nm)/HATCN(8 nm)/LiF(1 nm)/Al(100
nm); (II) ITO/HATCN(8 nm)/TPNCN-TPA (30 nm): 5 wt % Ir(ppy)3 or TPNCN-Cz (30 nm):5 wt % Ir(ppy)3/HATCN(8 nm)/LiF(1
nm)/Al(100 nm); (III) ITO/HATCN(8 nm)/CBP (30 nm): 5 wt % Ir(ppy)3 or CBP (30 nm): 5 wt % Ir(ppy)3/HATCN(8 nm)/LiF(1
nm)/Al(100 nm) and electron (e–)-only;
(IV) ITO/TPBi(8 nm)/CNPIBN/TPNCN-TPA/TPNCN-Cz(50 nm)/TPBi(8 nm)/LiF(1
nm)/Al(100 nm); (V) ITO/TPBi(8 nm)/TPNCN-TPA(30 nm): 5 wt % Ir(ppy)3 or TPNCN-Cz (30 nm): 5 wt % Ir(ppy)3/TPBi(8 nm)/LiF(1
nm)/Al(100 nm); and (VI) ITO/TPBi(8 nm)/CBP(30 nm): 5 wt % Ir(ppy)3 or CBP (30 nm): 5 wt % Ir(ppy)3/TPBi(8 nm)/LiF(1
nm)/Al(100 nm) (Figure 7) devices were made. The current-density difference among single-carrier
devices based on NPIBN, CNPIBP, CNPIBN, TPNCN-TPA, and TPNCN-Cz is
very small relative to the CBP device. This shows that these bipolar
materials effectively transport electrons as well as holes.64−66 A similar observation is made for TPNCN-TPA (30 nm): 5 wt % Ir(ppy)3 or TPNCN-Cz (30 nm): 5 wt % Ir(ppy)3-based devices
relative to CBP (30 nm): 5 wt % Ir(ppy)3 (Figure 7). In the CBP: 5 wt % Ir(ppy)3 device, the carrier current decreases significantly because
the carrier may undergo deep trapping at the HOMO level of Ir(ppy)3. However, in TPNCN-TPA (30 nm): 5 wt % Ir(ppy)3 or TPNCN-Cz (30 nm): 5 wt % Ir(ppy)3-based devices, the
carrier current increased which may be attributed to the effect of
direct injection into the dopant HOMO levels and the hopping transport
through both TPNCN-Cz/TPNCN-TPA and dopant sites (Figure 7). The 8 nm TPBi in the electron-only
device acts as a HBL (hole-blocking layer) to measure electron current
only. The hole-current density in CNPIBP and CNPIBN was lower than
that in NPIBN (Figure 7), which reveals that the CN group limits the h+-injection as well as transportation to some extent.63 In CNPIBP and CNPIBN devices, a similar e–-current charge was measured by high electric field
and h+-current was measured in low electric
field. This shows that CNPIBP and CNPIBN materials may be used as
a potential EML at low voltage for highly efficient OLEDs.

2.8 Electroluminescent Properties
The
HOMO–LUMO energies of the molecules employed to fabricate the
devices are presented in Figure 7. TADF materials show a flat-decay profile because
of the slow TADF process in the conversion of the exciton to singlet
state from the triplet state. However, the observed single-exponential
sharp decay of TPNCN-TPA and TPNCN-Cz shows that radiative excitons
of TPNCN-Cz and TPNCN-TPA are short-lived without contribution by
TADF (Figure 3). The
mono exponential TRPL shows the existence of single emissive state
,viz., HLCT. This is revealed by solventochromic studies in solvents
of moderate polarity. This endorses the proposed molecular design
(Scheme 1). Hence,
high ηs values observed in TPNCN-Cz and TPNCN-TPA
are not due to the TTA or TADF mechanism.19

The blue device, ITO/NPB(60 nm)/NPIBN/CNPIBP/CNPIBN/TPNCN-TPA/TPNCN-Cz(30
nm)/LiF(1 nm)/Al(100 nm) has been developed (Figure 7). The PL and EL emissions of bis phenanthrimidazoles
and D−π–A compounds are similar. This reveals
that PL and EL stem from the same singlet excitons following a similar
radiative path. Of the three bis phenanthrimidazoles, the CNPIBN device
exhibits superior performance (Figure 8: Table 5): (current efficiency 7.46 cd A–1, power efficiency
6.85 lm W–1, and external quantum efficiency 4.96%).
These devices show blue EL emission—CIE: (0.16, 0.12) NPIBN,
(0.16, 0.11) CNPIBP, and (0.16, 0.11) CNPIBN.

To enhance the efficiencies further, doped devices
with NPIBN,
CNPIBP, and CNPIBN as dopants were constructed with the structure
of ITO/NPB(40 nm)/TCTA(5 nm)/CBP:NPIBN/CBP:CNPIBP/CBP:CNPIBN(20 nm)/TPBI(50
nm)/LiF(1 nm)/Al(100 nm)]: CBP [LUMO −2.7 eV: HOMO −6.1
eV] used as the host for the fluorescent dopants for its high singlet
energy level. The doped device based on CBP: CNPIBN shows maximum
efficiencies [ηex 5.4%; ηc 7.56
cd A–1; and ηp 6.91 lm W–1) and CIE: (0.15, 0.09)] (Figure 8: Table 5). The doped devices exhibit higher ηex with deeper
CIE attributed to the doping concentration that not only suppressed
the exciton concentration quenching but also reduced the intermolecular
charge transfer effect results bathochromic shift. These high
device performances are comparable with already reported best blue
fluorescent OLEDs (Table S10).67 The high color purity and excellent luminescence
make NPIBN, CNPIBP, and CNPIBN potential candidates in OLED lighting
and full-color display.

Among the donor−π–acceptor
compounds (TPNCN-Cz
and TPNCN-TPA), the TPNCN-Cz device displays good performance. The
ηc, ηp, and ηex are 4.00 cd A–1, 3.42 lm W–1, and 2.32%, respectively (Figure 8: Table 5). ηex is calculated from the following equation:
EQE = ηout × ηrc × ηγ × ΦPL68 [ηout, coupling efficiency (20%); ηrc, product of charge-recombination efficiency (100%); ηγ,
radiative exciton production efficiency (25%); and ΦPL, PL quantum yield]. The ηr for TPNCN-TPA and TPNCN-Cz
based devices is calculated as 13–16% which indicates that
γ < 100% because of very small unbalanced charge transportation.69 This result ascribed to the effective charge
transportation to the EML by effective charge injection from the hole
transport layer (HTL). The maximum ηs is 16.3% for
TPNCN-TPA and 16.1% for TPNCN-Cz, which is obtained from ηs = ηout × ηPL ×
ηres/ηEL. The enhanced ηIQE by 10.1% for TPNCN-TPA and by 11.6% for TPNCN-Cz as well
as ηs are probably because of retained CT % due to
the CN group introduction in D−π–A compounds.

The efficiencies of the said devices and earlier reported70−85 devices are presented in Table S10. This
reveals that the nondoped devices with NPIBN, CNPIBP, CNPIBN, TPNCN-TPA,
and TPNCN-Cz and doped devices with CBP: NPIBN, CBP: CNPIBP, and CBP:
CNPIBN are the most efficient ones. These experimental results demonstrated
that the additional triplet excitons have been utilized in the OLED
applications for the HLCT character of TPNCN-TPA and TPNCN-Cz as presented
in Scheme 1 and show
the accuracy for our molecular design strategy. Devices with CNPIBP,
NPIBN, CNPIBN, and D−π–A architecture (TPNCN-TPA
and TPNCN-Cz) show maximum luminance (L) values of
35 890, 37 897, 39 862, 15 328, and 16 023
cd m–2, respectively. The EL brightness of these
compounds is linearly related to the current density. This indicates
that TTA was insignificant.86 The wavelength
of emission of TPNCN-TPA and TPNCN-Cz in the film are close to those
dissolved in ether; this endorses the HLCT-emissive state. The ηc and ηp of the TPNCN-Cz device (4.0 cd A–1; 3.42 lm W–1) and the TPNCN-TPA
device (3.89 cd A–1; 3.15 lm W–1) are larger compared to those of TPA-PA (1.16 cd A–1; 0.65 lm W–1), TPA-NzP (1.00 cd A–1; 0.77 lm W–1),75 and mTPA-PPI (0.84 cd A–1; 0.48 lm W–1) devices. The ηex values of TPNCN-Cz (78%) and
TPNCN-TPA (71%) are larger when compared with those of (i) Cz-BzP
(69.7%) and TPA-BzP (49.2%),87 (ii) CBI
(21%) and MCB (24%), and (iii) PPI-pCNCz (54%). Thickness
of LBPPI influences the ηc (50 nm: 0.01 cd A–1; 40 nm—0.13 cd A–1; 30 nm:
0.40 cd A–1 and 20 nm: 0.68 cd A–1).88 The ηc values obtained
in the current study with 30 nm TPNCN-Cz (4.0 cd A–1) and 30 nm TPNCN-TPA (3.89 cd A–1) are higher
than those reported already.87,88 For Cz-phenanthrimidazole,
ηc is 0.88 cd A–1 and ηp is 0.30 lm W–1 and Gao et al. observed
0.65 cd A–1 as ηc and 0.48 lm W–1 as ηp for Cz-phenanthrimidazole.88 These Cz compounds show lower efficiencies compared
to TPNCN-Cz (4.0 cd A–1; 3.42 lm W–1) and TPNCN-TPA (3.89 cd A–1; 3.15 lm W–1). Modification of EML thickness is likely to enhance the efficiencies
of the present materials. The device efficiency indicates that the
synthesized materials are the best fluorescent OLEDs materials.

These TPNCN-TPA and TPNCN-Cz are employed as hosts for green and
red phosphorescent dopants: green and red devices with configuration
ITO/NPB(40 nm)/TCTA(5 nm)/TPNCN-Cz(30 nm): 5 wt % Ir(ppy)3/TPNCN-TPA(30 nm): 5 wt % Ir(ppy)3/TPBI(50 nm)/LiF(1 nm)/Al(100
nm)]: ITO/NPB(40 nm)/TCTA(5 nm)/TPNCN-Cz(30 nm): 8 wt % Ir(MQ)2(acac)/TPNCN-TPA(30 nm): 8 wt % Ir(MQ)2(acac)/TPBI(50
nm)/LiF(1 nm)/Al(100 nm)] (Figure 9) have been developed, and [Ir(ppy)3-fac-tris(2-phenylpyridine) iridium(III) and Ir(MQ)2(acac)-bis(2-methyldibenzo-[f,h] quinoxaline)acetylacetonate iridium(III) are used as EMLs for green
and red devices, respectively.

red (b) devices with molecular
structures of functional materials used in devices.

The device performances are presented in Figure 8. The EL and PL emission
of doped films are
similar (Figure S1). At 4% Ir(ppy)3 dopant concentration, two emission peaks are observed. In
these devices, the TPNCN-Cz and TPNCN-TPA act as hosts for green phosphorescent
dopant (Ir(ppy)3) as well as blue emitters. A part of the
formed excitons would transfer to triplet energy of Ir(ppy)3 to excite phosphorescence, whereas other parts of excitons would
transfer to the ground state (S0) to generate fluorescence.67 When the doping concentration increased to 5%,
all generated excitons were transferred to Ir(ppy)3 to
produce phosphorescent emission (Figure S1b). For the green device of TPNCN-Cz(30 nm): 5 wt % Ir(ppy)3, L is 8998 cd m–2, ηc is 28.4 cd A–1, and ηp is 34.6 lm W–1 at 2.7 V (Table 5). The ηex values of TPNCN-Cz:Ir(ppy)3 and TPNCN-TPA:Ir(ppy)3 are 19.7 and 19.6%, respectively.
Similar to green devices, for a red device based on TPNCN-Cz:Ir(MQ)2(acac), L is 39 926 cd m–2 with excellent efficiencies (ηex 22.6%; ηc 26.1 cd A–1; and ηp 32.3
lm W–1) with CIE (0.64, 0.36) when compared with
a TPNCN-TPA-based device (L—42 213
cd/m2; ηex 20.3%; ηc 25.4
cd A–1; and ηp 30.8 lm W–1) with CIE (0.64, 0.36). The above experimental results demonstrate
that for green and red phosphorescent emission, TPNCN-TPA and TPNCN-Cz
are efficient host materials (Table 5).

3 Conclusions
We have
developed new blue emitters, bis phenanthroimidazole derivatives
(NPIBN, CNPIBP, and CNPIBN), and donor–spacer–acceptor
compounds (TPNCN-TPA and TPNCN-Cz) with bipolar properties and superior
thermal characteristics. For the fabricated CNPIBN device, ηex is 4.96%; ηc is 7.46 cd A–1; and ηp is 6.85 lm W–1 at lower
turn-on voltage. The doped one based on CBP: CNPIBN shows maximum
efficiencies (ηex 5.4%; ηc 7.56
cd A–1; and ηp 6.91 lm W–1) and CIE: (0.15, 0.09). The nondoped TPNCN-Cz device shows maximum
efficiencies (ηex 2.32%; ηc 4.00
cd A–1; and ηp 3.42 lm W–1) when compared to TPNCN-TPA (ηex 2.01%; ηc 3.89 cd A–1; and ηp 3.15
lm W–1). The TPNCN-TPA and TPNCN-Cz exhibit blue
emission; CIE: (0.15, 0.10) and (0.15, 0.10). The increased ηs of 16.3% for TPNCN-TPA and 16.1% for TPNCN-Cz and increased
ηIQE of 10.1% of TPNCN-TPA and 11.6% for TPNCN-Cz
are probably due to the CT component from cyano substitution. The
TPNCN-TPA and TPNCN-Cz are employed as the host for green and red
phosphorescent devices, respectively. For the green device of TPNCN-Cz
(30 nm): 5 wt% Ir(ppy)3, L is 8998 cd
m–2, ηc is 28.4 cd A–1, and ηp is 34.6 lm W–1 at 2.7
V (Table 5). The ηex values of TPNCN-Cz:Ir(ppy)3 and TPNCN-TPA:Ir(ppy)3 are 19.7 and 19.6%, respectively. Similar to green devices,
for the red device based on TPNCN-Cz:Ir(MQ)2(acac), L is 39926 cd m–2 with excellent efficiencies
(ηex 22.6%; ηc 26.1 cd A–1; and ηp 32.3 lm W–1) with CIE
(0.64, 0.36) when compared with the TPNCN-TPA-based device (L—42 213 cd/m2; ηex 20.3%; ηc 25.4 cd A–1; and ηp 30.8 lm W–1) with CIE (0.64, 0.36). We
have developed a chemical modification strategy to harvest high-performance
full-color OLEDs by utilizing bis phenanthrimidazoles in doped and
nondoped devices and bipolar luminescent materials having a D−π–A
molecular structure.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Measurements and General Methods
The 1H
and 13C NMR were recorded using a Bruker
400 MHz spectrometer, and mass spectra were obtained from Agilent
(LCMS VL SD). UV–vis absorption in solution and film was measured
on a Lambda 35 PerkinElmer spectrophotometer with its integrated sphere
(RSA-PE-20). PL spectra were recorded from an LS55 fluorescence spectrometer
(PerkinElmer). TGA and DSC were performed with a thermal analysis
system and NETZSCH-DSC-204 PerkinElmer, respectively, with a heating
rate of 10 °C min–1 and a N2 flow
rate of 100 mL min–1. Fluorescence lifetime of emissive
materials was estimated from time-resolved fluorescence decay obtained
by a TCSPC method (Horiba Fluorocube-01-NL lifetime system). The absolute
quantum yield was determined with a fluorescence spectrometer (Model-F7100).
Cyclic voltammetry was scanned with a potentiostat CHI 630A electrochemical
analyzer.
