In this study, the carbonation of
Portland cement by direct chemical
interaction with graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO)
at 7 and 28 days was examined. During the carbonation reaction, the
calcium-bearing phases (calcium hydroxide, calcium silicate hydrate,
and ettringite) formed calcium carbonate polymorphs, along with amorphous
silica gel, gypsum, and alumina gel. These reaction products were
examined using XRD (X-ray diffraction), XPS (energy-dispersive spectrometry),
and FTIR (Fourier transform infrared). XRD patterns showed that the
intensities of the calcium hydroxide and calcium carbonate peaks in
the hydrated cement mixed with GO and/or rGO are higher than the corresponding
peaks in the hydrated cement without any additives. The morphology
of the reaction products was also characterized by SEM (scanning electron
microscopy) measurements, which showed that a needle-like phase of
calcium carbonate develops on the hydrated cement. The obtained microstructure
parameters enabled the development of a more precise carbonation model.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Recently, the increased
attention on civil infrastructure enhancement
has motivated research on the possible modification of cement-based
materials to fulfill the growing requirements for sustainability in
the construction field.1,2 Modification is performed by some
selective additives and adjusting the cement composition. Several
attempts have been done to enhance the hardness, durability, and tensile
properties of the cement by utilizing different kinds of reinforcing
materials, from carbon fibers, steel fibers, and polymer fibers3−11 to nanomaterials,12,13 such as carbon nanotubes, graphene
derivatives, and nanosilica.14−17 In addition, multiple studies have been committed
to investigate the carbonation effects on the reinforced cement durability,2,18−26 and environmental factors such as temperature, relative humidity,
and partial pressure of carbon dioxide have been found to have enormous
effects on the carbonation of hydrated cement.19,20,24−26 Indeed, the carbonation
of hydrated cement implies an intricate effect on the microstructure;27−30 mild CO2 exposure enhances the compressive strength,
while extended exposure might negatively influence the mechanical
properties. More importantly, Pavlik21,22 demonstrated
that the reaction of the hydrated cement with atmospheric CO2 is generally a slow process and is highly dependent on some environmental
factors such as the concentration of atmospheric CO2, temperature,
and permeability of the material. Moreover, a few studies have been
conducted on the combination of graphene oxide (GO) with cement-based
materials,31−34 but they were essentially focused on improving microstructural and
mechanical properties, without realizing the possibility of the existence
of a direct chemical interaction between GO and hydrated cement. Li
et al.35 showed that the addition of 0.04
wt % GO enhanced the tensile strength by 67% in comparison with the
plain cement paste. Lv et al.37 indicated
that the addition of GO at ratios of 0.03, 0.05, and 0.07% increases
the compressive strength values of the GO/cement composites from 150
to 177 MPa. With the 0.05% GO ratio, the compressive and flexural
strengths were 176.64 and 31.6 MPa, respectively. Lu et al.36 demonstrated that the addition of 0.05% GO to
the cement paste increased the compressive and flexural strengths
to 11.1 and 16.2%, respectively. Until now, there have been no reports
on the direct interaction mechanism of GO with hydrated cement-based
materials, although we previously reported that GO and/or reduced
GO (rGO) in their direct chemical interaction with either Ca(OH)2 or CaO could be used to synthesize pure polymorph CaCO3 crystals with consistent morphology and size.38,41−45 This is related to the oxygen functional groups that decomposed
on the surfaces of GO or rGO in specific alkaline media releasing
CO, CO2, and water.38,41−46 The objective of the current research was to elucidate the mechanism
of the chemical interaction of GO or rGO with hydrated cement-based
materials, which is related to the oxygen functional groups that decomposed
on the surfaces of GO or rGO in specific alkaline media to react with
calcium-bearing phases in cement paste (CP), such as calcium hydroxide
(CH), calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H), and ettringite (AFt), which
contributed substantially to CaCO3 polymorph formation,
and showed that the formed CaCO3 amount far exceeded that
which could be obtained from complete CH dissolution. On the other
hand, the chemical interaction of the cement paste (CP) with GO or
rGO could be utilized to achieve specific economic and environmental
benefits. This can be viewed as a promising opportunity to take advantage
of this chemical reaction.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Mechanism of GO and rGO Reaction with Hydrated
Cement
Portland cement is a mixture of heterogeneous compounds
in an anhydrous state. This mixture originally consists of alite (C3S, Ca3SiO5), belite (C2S,
Ca2SiO4), tricalcium aluminate (C3A, Ca3Al2O6), and tetracalcium aluminoferrite
(C4AF, Ca4(Al,Fe)2O10)
as well as limited quantities of other impurities, such as magnesium
sulfate (MgSO4), sodium sulfate (Na2SO4), potassium sulfate (K2SO4), and gypsum (CaSO4·2H2O).1,2,47−49 During normal hydration, Portland cement will undergo
a complex hydration reaction to form CH (Ca(OH)2), C-S-H
gel (3CaO·2SiO2·4H2O), and ettringite
(AFt, CaAl2(SO4)3(OH)12·26H2O and AFm, Ca4Al2(OH)2·SO4·6H2O).1,44,45 In this regard, the direct chemical interactions
of GO or rGO (with pH 3.01) with hydrated cement have a neutralizing
effect on the highly alkaline medium of CP with a pH greater than
12.5 in the pore solution, inducing the acidic nature of the oxygen
functional groups on the graphene layer surfaces in GO or rGO, such
as carboxyl, hydroxyl, and epoxy.18,21−23,38−46

2.1.1 CH-Phase Carbonation
In a lower
alkaline environment, CH (portlandite, Ca(OH)2) is the
first component to start dissolution,24−26 inducing the process
of the oxygen functional group decomposition at the surfaces of GO
or rGO to release CO2, CO, and H2O, which appears
to be responsible for calcium carbonate (CaCO3) polymorph
formation18,24,38−46,52−54 according to eq 1: 1  

We believe that the
reaction of GO or rGO with hydrated cement is governed by the total
amount of the oxygen functional groups located on the surfaces of
GO and/or rGO. The determination of oxygen groups on the surfaces
of various carbon materials was analyzed by both the Boehm titration
and the thermal-programmed desorption (TPD) methods.41−45,65 TPD gives quantitative information
about the total number of surface oxygen groups, which break down
at various temperatures to release CO, CO2, and H2O, even though the Boehm titration method provides both qualitative
and quantitative information solely regarding acidic and basic groups
(which include phenols, lactone groups, and carboxylic acids). The
acidic nature of the oxygen functional groups could be equalized by
bases of various strengths such as NaHCO3, Na2CO3, and NaOH.

2.1.2 C-S-H-Phase Carbonation
The results
strongly indicate that the direct reaction of C-S-H with GO or rGO
results in the formation of amorphous silica gel and various CaCO3 polymorphs according to eq 2: 2  

2.1.2.1 C-S-H Gel
As stated in our
previous work,38 the direct reaction of
GO or rGO with Ca(OH)2 or CaO results in CaCO3 formation. Thus, the rate and degree of the carbonation of the C-S-H
gel depend greatly on the amounts of CO2 and CO released
during decomposition, which are associated to the total amount of
the oxygen functional groups located on the surfaces of GO or rGO.38−46 It is well established that carboxyl and lactone groups are responsible
for CO2 production, while aldehyde, carbonyl, and phenols
are responsible for the production of CO.40−45 Taking into account weathering carbonation upon extended exposure
to atmospheric CO2 in the process, C-S-H is believed to
be more decalcified and to lose its binding ability accordingly.24−26,53,54 Carbonation of the C-S-H gel generally results in calcite, aragonite,
and vaterite formation.26 Aragonite and
vaterite formation are apparently related to the existence of highly
decalcified C-S-H and consequently to high CO2 (GO or rGO
decomposition product) concentrations.24−26,38−46,52−54 Moreover, we
expect that the direct chemical interactions of GO or rGO with hydrated
cement-based materials do not necessarily result in full carbonation
on the surface of the cement paste but rather that a completely carbonated
zone can exist in the core of the paste.

2.1.3 Ettringite-Phase Carbonation
Our
results also emphasize the effective chemical interactions of GO or
rGO with other calcium-bearing phases. Apart from the CH and C-S-H
phases, ettringite and aluminates are other cement phases that decompose
upon reaction with GO or rGO, resulting in gypsum (CaSO4·2H2O) and alumina gel (Al2O3·mH2O) formation according to eq 3: 3  

The carbonation of
ettringite may lead to vaterite crystal formation.55−57 Carbonation
of all calcium-bearing phases, such as CH, C-S-H, and ettringite,
contributes substantially to CaCO3 polymorph formation,
and it is frequently mentioned that the formed CaCO3 amount
far exceeded that which could be obtained from the entire CH dissolution.24,52−58

Moreover, during carbonation, both GO and rGO eventually decompose
to form CO2, CO, and H2O, which completely react
with hydrated cement (calcium-bearing phases, CH, C-S-H, and ettringite)
to form CaCO3. The Boehm titration method reported that
the acidity of the oxygen functional groups on the carbon materials
can be equalized by bases of various strengths. The oxygen functional
groups decompose at various temperatures to release CO, CO2, and water. During decomposition, the released CO and CO2 associated to the total amount of the oxygen functional groups located
on the surfaces of GO or rGO. It is well established that carboxyl
and lactone groups are responsible for CO2 production,
while aldehyde, carbonyl, and phenols are responsible for the production
of CO.41−45,65 Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) formation was detected using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
spectra, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, etc., as will be discussed
later. Therefore, this mechanism emphasizes the chemical interaction
between hydrated cement and GO or rGO, resulting in the formation
of CaCO3 (calcite polymorph), regardless of the variation
between GO and rGO, specifically in terms of their physical properties,
and the surface morphologies of GO and rGO.38

Overall, the carbonation of hydrated cement (formation of
CaCO3 with silica gel) can be useful for cement-based materials,
as it has previously been reported to enhance the compressive and
flexural strengths of cement and reduce the atmospheric carbonation
of hydrated cementitious matrices.24,31−34 Conversely, the prolonged carbonation of hydrated cement, such as
CH and the C-S-H phase, may lead to corrosion of reinforcing steel
bars due to a pH decrease to a certain level (less than 9.7), which
may cause serious structural damage.

2.2 XRD Characterization
XRD characterization
was implemented to identify the crystalline phases of the solid products.
A representative set of diffraction data for the four hydrated cements
is shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 XRD patterns of hydrated cement and hydrated cement mixed with
0.07% of GO and 0.07% of rGO at 7 and 28 days.

A comparison of the peak intensities between hydrated cement
and
GO and/or rGO provides some insight into their relative compositions.
Evidently, the acidic nature of the oxygen functional groups on the
graphene-derivative layers, such as epoxy, hydroxyl, and carboxyl,18,21−23,38−46 on the surfaces of GO or rGO (with pH 3.01) has a neutralizing effect
on the highly alkaline medium of the hydrated cement with a pH greater
than 12.5 in the pore solution. Therefore, the intensities of the
CH and CaCO3 peaks in hydrated cement mixed with GO and/or
rGO are higher than the corresponding peaks in the hydrated cement
without any additives.

The XRD patterns also show the CaCO3 peak intensity,
which increases with GO and/or rGO addition due to the increase in
CH, which is available for carbonation as a result of the presence
of the oxygen functional groups that decompose on the surfaces of
GO or rGO. This process releases CO2, CO, and H2O,38−46 which can be precipitated in one or a mix of various polymorphs
of CaCO3 (calcite, aragonite, and vaterite). Calcite appears
to be the primary crystalline CaCO3 polymorph, with diffraction
peaks at 2θ = 23°, 29.3°, 36°, 43°, 48.4°,
and 64.3°, which are attributed to calcite. Characteristic peaks
of vaterite and aragonite at 2θ = 25° and 45°, respectively,
are evident, but they are relatively low compared with that of calcite.
However, the XRD patterns show sharp calcite reflections, confirming
the effective formation of calcite.20,24−26,48,51,59 Further, a comparison of the XRD patterns
for the CaCO3 particles acquired using GO and/or rGO reveals
that the XRD peaks for the hydrated cement mixed with GO and/or rGO
are sharper than those of the hydrated cement without any additives.

Typical energy-dispersive spectrometry (XPS) spectra of the chemical
interaction of GO or rGO with hydrated cement at 7 and 28 days are
shown in Figure 2.
The original and fitting curves of the Ca(OH)2 and CaCO3 phases match remarkably well.

Figure 2 XPS spectra of Ca 2p
for hydrated cement: (a, b) with 0.07% of
GO and (c, d) with 0.07% of rGO at 7 and 28 days.

Indeed, a GO or rGO reaction with calcium-bearing phases
(CH and
C-S-H) in hydrated cement can cause chemical–mechanical changes
in the microstructure.24 Due to the acidic
nature of the oxygen functional groups on the surfaces of GO or rGO,
they will decompose in the highly alkaline medium releasing CO, CO2, and H2O, leading to faster carbonation, more
Ca(OH)2 consumption, and consequently more CaCO3 generation.25,29,38,60

2.3 FTIR Spectrum Analysis
The FTIR spectra
of hydrated cement and hydrated cement mixed with GO and/or rGO at
7 and 28 days are shown in Figures 3 and 4. The positions of all
of the infrared active modes of calcite found in hydrated cement mixed
with GO and/or rGO precisely match those of the calcite reference
bands.38,50,64 It can be
seen from the infrared spectra (Figures 3 and 4) of hydrated
cement mixed with GO and/or rGO that asymmetric stretching (v3) gives
rise to a very sharp and broad infrared absorption at 1425 cm–1. Out-of-plane and in-plane bending (v2 and v4) correspond
to the fundamental bands of calcite at 872 and 713 cm–1, respectively.19,38 The clear presence of these absorption
bands confirms the formation of the calcite phase of CaCO3 particles when either GO or rGO is mixed with hydrated cement.38 It should be noted that no residual peaks of
GO or rGO are observable, confirming our predictions about the eventual
decomposition to form CO2, CO, and H2O.38−46 In addition, it has been reported that thermal-programmed desorption
(TPD) was used to characterize the oxygenated functional groups on
the surfaces of the carbon materials, which break down at various
temperatures releasing CO, CO2, and H2O.65 This analysis also confirms the XRD and XPS
analysis results presented in Figure 1. In addition, it is crucial to note that more intense/sharper
characteristic peaks are observable in the FTIR spectra for the calcite
particles acquired using either GO or rGO with hydrated cement than
in the spectra for the hydrated cement without any additives. The
peaks at 450 cm–1 falls in the range of 400–500
cm–1, which corresponds to the Si–O bending
vibration (v2) in SiO4–2, according to
refs (19) and (50). Furthermore, both spectra
show peaks at 950 cm–1, corresponding to asymmetric
Si–O stretching vibrations, which indicates limited polymerization
in C-S-H.19,50,61

Figure 3 FTIR spectra
of hydrated cement and hydrated cement mixed with
0.07% of GO and 0.07% of rGO at 7 days.

Figure 4 FTIR spectra of hydrated cement and hydrated cement mixed with
0.07% of GO and 0.07% of rGO at 28 days.

Moreover, the four spectra show weak bands at 1108 cm–1, falling in the range of 1100–1165 cm–1, which corresponds to SO4–2 vibration
(v3) in sulfates.50,62,63 This region has a range of peaks that may overlap due to the polymerization
of SiO4–2 and the corresponding vibration
(v3).48,50 The water band peaks of the four spectra,
which are located at 1642 cm–1, indicate the H–O–H
bending vibration (v2) of the adsorbed water molecule.19,50

Several additional weak bands between 3000 and 2000 cm–1 are overtone modes. Meanwhile, the peaks at 3390
cm–1, which fall in the range of 3100–3400
cm–1, correspond to the O–H stretching vibrations
(v1 and v3)
in the water molecules.19,48 The peaks at 3640 cm–1 (Figures 3 and 4) correspond to CH, which is
formed as silicate phases in the hydrated cement. It is clear that
the intensities of the characteristic peaks of CH decrease markedly
when either GO and/or rGO is mixed with hydrated cement, compared
to their intensities in the spectra of the hydrated cement without
any additives. This difference is mainly due to the reaction of CH
with liberated CO2 from the decomposition of the oxygen
functional groups of GO or rGO.19,38−46,48,50,62,63,65 These findings also confirm the XRD and XPS analysis
results discussed previously and prove that GO and/or rGO have high
reactivity with hydrated cement, leading to nano-calcium carbonate
generation.38 Nano-calcium carbonate can
block the pores in the hardened cement, which may or may not improve
the mechanical properties.

2.4 SEM
The microstructures
of hydrated
cement mixed with 0.07% of GO and/or rGO were examined using scanning
electron microscopy (SEM). The SEM results presented in Figures 5 and 6 depict the microstructures of the hydrated cement mixed with GO
and/or rGO at 7 and 28 days. Figure 5A,B shows the microstructure of the hydrated cement
without any additives, proving that the microstructure is an amorphous
solid with a large amount of microcracks, porosity, and pore size
distribution. When compared with Figure 5C–F, the results prove that the hydrated
cement composites mixed with a 0.07% dosage of GO and /or rGO have
a certain amount of needle-like crystal products and form compacted
microstructures, which strongly prove that, due to the acidic nature
of the oxygen functional groups located on the surfaces of GO or rGO,
they will decompose in a highly alkaline medium releasing CO, CO2, and H2O,38,41−45 which accelerate the dissolution rate and the hydration of cement
at the first few minutes of the starting reaction. The acceleration
phase of CaCO3 formation starts due to the direct carbonation
reaction of cement hydrates with GO and/or rGO at different times
(Figure 5C–F).
Moreover, the results indicate that the direct reaction of GO and/or
rGO with hydrated cement produces a certain amount of CaCO3 crystals that participate in forming the cross-linking and interweaving
microstructure, which leads to enhancing the mechanical behavior of
the hydrated cement paste. Figure 6A–D shows different portions and magnifications
of a relatively higher growth of the calcite phase of CaCO3 in the hydrated cement mixed with GO and/or rGO at 7 and 28 days.
Simultaneously, a needle-like phase develops on the cement particles.
This needle-like phase has been linked to the calcite structure in
earlier studies.38,48,50 The distribution of CaCO3 crystals in hydrated cement
composites could be identified by inspecting the CaCO3 crystals
in a whole SEM image using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX).
The EDX-inspected areas are marked as white boxes in Figure 6A–D. The EDX test results
indicate that the needle-like crystals of CaCO3 is uniformly
distributed within the whole inspected area (Figure 7). These results also suggest that the needle-like
phase formed continuously during hydration and grew even more after
28 days of hydration. As a matter of fact, the various morphologies
of CaCO3 particles resulted from the variations in the
concentration and type of the oxygen functional groups on the surfaces
of GO and rGO, which serve as active sites and play an essential role
in such reactions.38−45 However, both GO and rGO eventually decompose to form CO2, CO, and H2O in a highly alkaline medium, which completely
react with hydrated cement (calcium-bearing phases, CH, C-S-H, and
ettringite) to form needle-like crystals of CaCO3. These
findings also confirm the XRD, XPS, and FTIR analysis results and
prove that GO and/or rGO have high reactivity with hydrated cement.

3 Conclusions
The development of GO and rGO cementation actions is a significant
area of interest in the construction field. The impressive ability
of GO to release CO2, CO, and H2O through the
decomposition of the oxygen functional groups in certain alkaline
media, which appears to be behind the carbonation of Portland cement,
is a phenomenon that could be employed to elucidate the mechanism
of this chemical interaction. Toward this end, this study was focused
on investigating the critical reaction mechanism using GO, rGO, and
Portland cement and on how these materials may influence CH, C-S-H,
and ettringite carbonation. The rate and degree of CH and C-S-H gel
carbonation depend fully on the quantities of CO2 and CO
released during decomposition, which are associated to the total amount
of the oxygen functional groups located on the surfaces of GO or rGO.
These processes result in an obvious pH reduction to a certain level
(less than 9.7). The ettringite and aluminate phases decompose upon
reaction with GO or rGO, resulting in gypsum and alumina gel formation.
XRD, XPS, and FTIR were used to confirm the CaCO3 polymorph
formation. The SEM images also corroborated the needle-like phase
attributed to the calcite polymorph. Principally, the current study
has evidently established the usefulness of GO and/or rGO with hydrated
cement for obtaining CaCO3, which could be beneficial for
the cement industry, as it has previously been reported to increase
the compressive and flexural strengths of CP and reduce the atmospheric
carbonation of hydrated cementitious matrices.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Preparation of Cement–GO
GO
was synthesized from graphite powder (200 mesh, Alfa-Aesar) utilizing
the Hummers’ method.38,40 Ordinary Portland cement
(type 52.5, Green Island, Hong Kong) was utilized in this work, and
the chemical composition collected by X-ray fluorescence is listed
in Table 1. Table 2 details the mixture
ratios of the GO and/or rGO with modified cement paste. The mixture
was prepared first by ultrasonication of the aqueous solution of GO
for 15 min, which was then slowly mixed with cement (at a ratio of
0.4 water to cement by weight) at the speed of a high rate for 8 min
before casting into molds and covering with plastic sheets. The samples
were cured in ambient conditions for 24 h, demolded, and placed into
a curing room (25 °C/RH 95%) until testing.

4.2 Preparation
of Cement–rGO
rGO was prepared following the same
method that was reported previously.38Table 2 details the mixture
ratios of the GO and/or rGO with modified
cement paste. The mixture was prepared first by ultrasonication of
the aqueous solution of rGO for 15 min, which was then slowly mixed
with cement (w/c = 0.4 by weight) at the speed of a high rate for
8 min before casting into molds and covering with plastic sheets.
The samples were cured in ambient conditions for 24 h, demolded, and
placed into a curing room (25 °C/RH 95%) until testing. For both
GO or rGO with hydrated cement, the samples were aged for 7 and 28
days and subjected to hydration stoppage by immersing in acetone and
then drying at 50 °C for 1 h. They were then kept in an air-tight
container to prevent any air exposure until observations were performed.

4.3 Material Characterization
The produced
samples were characterized by XRD patterns, which were collected by
a PW1830 (Philips) system at 2 kW, using a Cu anode and a graphite
monochromatic system. XPS measurements were performed by a Kratos
Axis Ultra DLD Multitechnique using a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray
source. The FTIR spectra were acquired using a Vertex 70 Hyperion
1000 (Bruker) spectrometer in the range of 400–4000 cm–1 averaged over 32 scans. The SEM images were carried
out in a JEOLJSM-6700F scanning electron microscope equipped with
an energy-dispersive X-ray analyzer.
