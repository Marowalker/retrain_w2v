Low-molecular-weight ice recrystallization
inhibitors (IRIs) are
ideal cryoprotectants that control the growth of ice and mitigate
cell damage during freezing. Herein, we describe a detailed study
correlating the ice recrystallization inhibition activity and the
cryopreservation ability with the structure of O-aryl-glycosides.
Many effective IRIs are efficient cryoadditives for the freezing of
red blood cells (RBCs). One effective cryoadditive did not inhibit
ice recrystallization but instead inhibited ice nucleation, demonstrating
the significance of inhibiting both processes and illustrating the
importance of this emerging class of cryoprotectants.

Introduction
The development of
highly efficient methods to cryopreserve cells,
tissues, and organs is becoming exceedingly important to meet the
increasing demands of emerging cellular therapies. Cryopreservation
of blood and stem cells has had tremendous impact on regenerative
and transfusion medicine. Hematopoietic stem cells from umbilical
cord blood are used in therapies to treat immunodeficiencies and hematological
cancers.1,2 Red blood cells (RBCs) are also in high
demand for lifesaving transfusions and in the treatments of hematological
cancers and anemias. Currently, RBC storage is limited to 42 days
at 4 °C, which can result in blood shortages when high numbers
of emergency transfusions are required.3 Although cryopreservation can extend the storage time to 10 years,
major limitations to current protocols largely limit this preservation
method to rare blood types and autologous RBCs.3−5

Dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) and glycerol are the most commonly used
cryoprotectants, and both readily penetrate cell membranes.6−8 Although these are efficient and result in high post-thaw cell viability,
issues arise from toxicity both on a cellular level and in a clinical
setting when directly transfused into patients.9−11 For RBCs, the
cryoprotectant must be removed after thawing before transfusion, which
is a costly and time-consuming process that precludes the routine
use of frozen RBC units. In North America, RBCs are cryopreserved
in 40% glycerol using a slow freezing rate (approx. 1 °C/min),
and glycerol must be reduced to less than 1% before transfusion to
avoid intravascular hemolysis, a process that can take up to 1 h.4,12 New cryoprotectants that can eliminate or reduce the amount of glycerol
(and DMSO) will greatly improve the logistical issues associated with
managing inventories of frozen cells and tissues, making these more
accessible for lifesaving therapies.

Ice recrystallization is
a significant contributor to cellular
damage and death during the freezing and thawing steps of the cryopreservation
process.13−15 Thus, there is tremendous interest in designing compounds
that are effective ice recrystallization inhibitors (IRIs) to mitigate
this damage and improve cellular viability and function post-thaw.16−20 Antifreeze (glyco)proteins [AF(G)Ps] are nature’s most potent
IRIs;21−23 however, they often fail as cryoprotectants because
of their ability to bind to ice and alter the ice crystal habit, which
is detrimental to cells.24−27 Large peptides and glycopeptide analogues of AF(G)Ps28−30 and high-molecular-weight polymers18,31−33 such as poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) have also been explored as cryoprotectants.
However, small molecules with molecular masses less than 300 atomic
mass units are highly attractive alternatives that can be efficiently
synthesized and are amenable to large-scale preparations. Furthermore,
there is less likelihood of nonspecific toxic effects and immunogenic
responses that can be associated with peptides or proteins.

Prior work
by our group has demonstrated that small amphiphilic
carbohydrate-based and amino acid-based molecules can be very effective
IRIs.34−36 Recently, our group has reported two novel glucose-based O-aryl-glycosides, β-PMP-Glc (1) and
β-pBrPh-Glc (9) (Figure 1A), bearing a para-substituted
aryl moiety as the hydrophobic component, which are very effective
IRIs.37 Furthermore, these compounds are
effective cryoprotectants for human RBCs, furnishing high post-thaw
yields using only 15% glycerol and not 40%, resulting in shorter post-thaw
deglycerolization times. This is the first example where a small molecule
IRI was used as a cryoprotectant. Herein, we report a detailed investigation
into the structural features important for the IRI activity and cryopreservation
ability of this novel class of O-aryl-glycoside ice
recrystallization inhibitor.

Figure 1 Structures and IRI activity of β-linked para-substituted (A) β-PMP-Glc (1) and O-aryl-glucosides 3–15 and
(B) β-PMP-Gal
(2) and O-aryl-galactosides 16–28. All compounds were assessed at 22 mM in
PBS. IRI activity is represented as % MGS relative to the PBS positive
control. The error bars indicate standard error of the mean (SEM).

Results and Discussion
β-PMP-Glc
(1) is a glucose-based derivative
bearing a para-methoxyphenyl (PMP) moiety and is
an effective inhibitor of ice recrystallization. However, the galactose
analogue β-PMP-Gal (2) exhibits very weak activity
(Figure 1).37 This was surprising because previous reports
from our laboratory described that pyranose-based derivatives containing
a more hydrated galactose head group were better IRIs than those with
less hydrated glucose head groups.29,34,38 To further explore this, we studied the influence
of the para-substituent on activity by substituting
this position with various atoms and functional groups. The IRI activity
of the glucose-based (3–15) and the
galactose-based (16–28) derivatives
was determined using a “splat-cooling assay” (Figure 1).39,40 IRI activity is represented as a ratio of the mean grain size (MGS)
of ice crystals of a given sample to that of a phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) solution, with smaller percent MGS (% MGS) values indicative
of smaller ice crystals and more effective inhibition.

Many
of the O-aryl-glucosides exhibit moderate
to weak activity (Figure 1A), and most of them are less active (larger crystals) than
β-PMP-Glc (1). Substitution of the para-methoxy moiety with halogens (−F, −Cl, or −Br, 7–9) or a trifluoromethyl group (−CF3, 12) resulted in similar or better IRI activity,
with the most active compound being β-pBrPh-Glc (9). The para-iodo derivative could be assessed only
at its maximum solubility of 5.5 mM, and it was inactive (data not
shown). It is evident that the methyl group of the −OMe is
crucial for the activity of β-PMP-Glc because replacement of
this moiety with an −OH or −OCF3 (4 and 15) group decreased activity. An oxygen atom connecting
the aryl ring and the methyl group is also important because 5 resulted in a similar reduction in activity.

The O-aryl-galactosides exhibit a very different
activity profile than the glucosides. Most galactosides had weak activity
that was much less than that of galactose (Figure 1B). Potent activity was observed with −Cl
and −Br substituents (21–22); however, the fluoro-derivative 20 was inactive. In
general, the galactosides were less active than the corresponding
glucose derivatives. Exceptions include 16, 24, and 26 with a para–NH2, −CO2Me, or −NO2 group, compared
with analogous glucose derivatives 3, 11, and 13. Overall, it is evident that electronic effects
do not influence the ice recrystallization inhibition ability of the O-aryl-glycosides in any obvious manner. In the glucoside
series, −OMe, −OH, and −NH2 groups
(1, 3–4) are all electron-donating
groups (EDGs), yet 1 is highly active, whereas 3 is the least active glucose derivative. Moreover, both −NO2 and −CF3 groups are strong electron-withdrawing
groups (EWGs); however, the −CF3 derivative 12 was highly active, whereas the −NO2 derivative 13 was only moderately active. In the galactoside series,
none of the derivatives with EDGs were active (2, 16–19). The activity of derivatives with
EWGs varied from weak (20 and 23) to moderate
(25–26) with only 24 exhibiting high activity.

Thus far, in this class of compounds,
one of the best IRIs is β-PMP-Glc
(1), and it appears that substitution at the para-position with anything other than a methoxy or a halogen
group is detrimental for activity. We next sought to explore other
derivatives of the β-PMP-Glc structure to determine other structural
features that are important for this potent activity (Figure 2). This included exploring
the C1 glycosidic bond stereochemistry (29–34), the effect of methoxy group regiochemistry (35–36), and the importance of an O-linkage (37–39) at C1. Unfortunately,
all of these modifications were detrimental to IRI activity. An α-linkage
greatly reduced the activity (30), a trend that was observed
also with the α-linked halogen derivatives 33–34, highlighting the importance of a β-linkage. Similarly,
a methoxy group in the para-position was essential
as meta- and ortho-derivatives 35–36 displayed moderate activity. It
is evident that modifying the O-glycosidic linkage
is also detrimental because N- and S-linked PMP derivatives 37–38 had drastically decreased the activity.
In addition, a direct connection of the aryl ring to the C1 oxygen
is crucial because the para-methoxybenzyl derivative 39 was also inactive. Finally, conjugating the O-PMP group to the C6 position (40) rather than C1 also
resulted in weak activity.

Figure 2 Structures and IRI activity (% MGS relative
to PBS) of α-
and β-linked PMP-glycoside derivatives 29–40. The error bars indicate SEM.

The IRI activity of β-PMP-Glc is highly sensitive to
the
relative orientation of the hydroxyl groups on the pyranose ring.
Equatorial C2 and C4 hydroxyl groups are required because β-PMP-Gal
(2) and β-PMP-Man (29) were weakly
active (Figure 2).
Furthermore, the C6-hydroxymethyl group is also important because
removing this group (xylose derivative 41), methylating
this position (42), and extending this position by one
carbon (43) diminished activity (Figure 3). Glycosylating the C6 position of β-PMP-Glc
resulted in a similar decrease in activity, and this was independent
of the glycosidic-bond stereochemistry or whether the conjugated monosaccharide
was galactose or glucose (44–46).
Interestingly, glycosylation at the C4 position appears to be tolerated
with little change in activity. β-PMP-lactose 47 had better activity than disaccharides 44–46, although its activity was diminished compared with that
of the parent β-PMP-Glc. Collectively, these results highlight
the importance of the various hydroxyl groups on the pyranose ring
of β-PMP-Glc and how the C6-OH is particularly sensitive to
modifications.

Figure 3 Structures and IRI activity (% MGS relative to PBS) of
β-PMP-Glc
derivatives 41–43 and β-PMP-disaccharide
derivatives 44–50. The error bars
indicate SEM.

Other disaccharides assessed
for activity were the dihydroxybenzene-linked
disaccharides 48–50. These were 1,1-linked using
an O-phenyl group in which the para-substituent was a second β-linked galactose or glucose residue
(Figure 3). Interestingly,
disaccharide 48 containing two β-linked glucose
units had potent IRI activity that was slightly less than that of
β-PMP-Glc. Thus, it appears that replacing the para-methoxy substituent with another glucose residue retains activity.
Conversely, when the para-substituent was a galactose
unit (49), only moderate IRI activity was observed. Disaccharide 50 containing two galactose units had weak activity that was
similar to that of the monosaccharide β-PMP-Gal (2), indicating that the additional galactose unit had no effect on
ice recrystallization inhibition.

Overall, the ice recrystallization
inhibition data of the O-aryl-glycosides uncovered
a few compounds in this class
of molecules that are highly efficient IRIs. Having previously reported
that both β-PMP-Glc (1) and β-pBrPh-Glc (9) are also effective cryoadditives for RBCs,37 we investigated the cryoprotective ability of many of these
derivatives. This would provide insight into the structural features
of β-PMP-Glc that are beneficial for its cryoprotective ability
and would also allow us to explore the relationship between ice recrystallization
inhibition and the cryopreservation ability for this class of compounds.
Two freezing protocols were used to cryopreserve human RBCs in cryoprotective
solutions containing a reduced quantity of glycerol (15%) with or
without the O-aryl-glycoside additives. A two-step
slow-freezing protocol was used where samples were cooled at a rate
of 1 °C/min to −40 °C, then immediately stored at
−80 °C before thawing.8,41 This is representative
of the current clinical RBC cryopreservation protocols used in North
America with high glycerol concentrations (40%).3,12,42,43 A rapid-freezing
protocol was also used where samples were dumped into dry ice (−80
°C) to achieve rapid freezing rates.3,4,44O-Aryl-glycoside derivatives
were assessed at concentrations previously determined to be most effective
for β-PMP-Glc (1) and β-pBrPh-Glc (9).37 Post-thaw hemolysis was quantified
using the Drabkin’s assay.45,46 RBC freezing
results (Figure 4)
are reported as a percentage of post-thaw integrity (100 −
% hemolysis). O-Aryl-glycosides that have a potent
IRI activity are indicated by a diamond (⧫) to easily identify
the RBC freezing results of these compounds.

− % hemolysis). The error bars represent SEM. ⧫ indicates
compounds with a potent IRI activity.

With the slow-freezing protocol, 110 mM β-PMP-Glc in
15%
glycerol doubles the post-thaw RBC integrity (50%) of the 15% glycerol
control (25%). Other derivatives with potent IRI activity, such as
β-pFPh-Glc (7) and β-pBrPh-Glc (9), furnished similar results. It is interesting to note that 9 is more effective at 30 mM than at 55 mM, suggesting that
toxicity may be an issue with this particular compound. Disaccharide 48, which was a moderate inhibitor of ice recrystallization,
failed to increase post-thaw integrity and was worse than 15% glycerol.
Many of the less-active glucosides failed to give post-thaw integrity
higher than the glycerol control (25%–30%, 4, 6, 15). Surprisingly, β-pMePh-Glc (5) and α-PMP-Glc (30) had similar post-thaw
integrities as β-PMP-Glc (50%–60%) despite being less
active. It appears that simply the presence of the methyl group either
directly connected to the aryl ring (5) or linked through
an oxygen atom (1) is sufficient for RBC freezing, and
removal of this group (with 4 and 6) abolishes
any cryoprotective effect. In contrast to ice recrystallization inhibition,
cryoprotective ability is not sensitive to C1 glycosidic-bond stereochemistry
because α- and β-PMP-Glc had similar post-thaw RBC integrity.
When O-aryl-galactosides were used as cryoadditives,
β-PMP-Gal (2) in 15% glycerol resulted in a slightly
better post-thaw integrity than β-PMP-Glc (65%), despite the
fact that this compound was not IRI active. In contrast to the PMP-Glc
derivatives, the cryoprotective ability of the Gal derivatives is
sensitive to the stereochemistry of the glycosidic-bond because α-PMP-Gal
(31) resulted in a low post-thaw integrity similar to
15% glycerol. The fact that 2 and 9 were
effective cryoprotectants, yet 2 was not IRI active,
was a very surprising and unexpected result. Subsequent experiments
have verified that although 2 does not exhibit ice recrystallization
inhibition it is a very effective inhibitor of ice nucleation.47 β-PMP-Gal (2) results in
a significantly higher percentage of unfrozen droplets of water when
supercooled to −37 °C (Figure 5), inactivating the ice-nucleating agent
AgI. This result could explain the ability of 2 to increase
the number of post-thaw RBCs because when nucleation is inhibited,
a greater degree of supercooling is permitted. The end result of this
is that more intracellular water will exit the RBCs, leading to less
intracellular ice and less cellular damage.

Figure 5 Fraction f of unfrozen droplets for water and
different aqueous solutions 1, 2, and 9 at 22 mM with AgI particles (5 < d <
25 μm, 2 ≤ NAgI ≤
8) as a function of the sample temperature.

The highest post-thaw RBC integrity observed with the slow-freezing
conditions was with the two compounds that were the most potent ice
recrystallization inhibitors, β-pBrPh-Glc (9) and
β-pBrPh-Gal (22). The post-thaw integrity was 65%
with 55 mM β-pBrPh-Gal (22) and 67% with 30 mM
β-pBrPh-Glc (9). Both of these derivatives were
also very effective with rapid freezing rates (Figure 4B). The addition of 30 mM of either of these
derivatives to 15% glycerol resulted in almost 95% post-thaw integrity,
which is significantly higher than that of 15% glycerol (75% integrity).
When the glycerol concentration was decreased to 10%, 30 mM β-pBrPh-Glc
(9) was still highly effective in preventing post-thaw
hemolysis, resulting in almost triple the RBC integrity (67%) compared
to that of 10% glycerol (23%).

Conclusions
Overall, the RBC freezing
experiments demonstrate that IRIs β-PMP-Glc
(1), β-pBrPh-Glc (9), and β-pBrPh-Gal
(22) can be used at low concentrations in combination
with 15% glycerol to provide high post-thaw RBC integrity with slow
freezing rates that are used clinically to cryopreserve RBCs. Currently,
this protocol requires 40% glycerol and time-consuming deglycerolization
methods. Thus, significantly reducing glycerol concentrations can
drastically improve post-thaw processing and allow for faster access
to cryopreserved RBC units. The results presented in this article
have highlighted how small structural changes to O-aryl-glycosides modulate the ability of these compounds to inhibit
ice recrystallization and alter cryoprotective ability. In addition,
some of these compounds are potent inhibitors of ice nucleation. This
study is the first detailed structure–function analysis that
correlates changes in structure with the ability of a molecule to
inhibit ice recrystallization and protect against cryoinjury during
freezing. The O-aryl-glycosides represent a novel
class of small-molecule IRIs, many of which were effective cryoadditives
used for the freezing of RBCs with reduced glycerol concentrations.
The synthesis of these structurally simple molecules is amenable to
large-scale preparation for use in cryopreservation applications to
improve upon cryopreservation protocols of therapeutically important
cells.

Methods
All methods were carried out in accordance
with approved guidelines.

Preparation of O-Aryl-Glycosides
Experimental
procedures and spectroscopic data for the preparation of O-aryl-glycosides are described in the Supporting Information.

Ice Recrystallization Inhibition Activity
Ice recrystallization
inhibition activity was measured using a “splat cooling”
assay.39 All compounds were assessed in
a PBS solution. The sample solution (10 μL) was dropped from
a micropipette onto a polished aluminum block precooled to −80
°C through a tube two meters in height. The resulting frozen
wafer was transferred to a cryostage held at −6.4 °C to
anneal for 30 min. After the annealing time, a digital camera (Nikon
CoolPix 5000) fitted to a microscope was used to photograph the ice
crystals present in the wafer. For each wafer, three images were used
to quantify the area of 12 ice crystals within the image (n = 36 crystals per drop), and three drops of each sample
were assayed (n = 108 per sample). A domain recognition
software (DRS) program was used to analyze each image and employed
a Microsoft Windows Graphical Interface to allow for the demarcation
and storage of the vertices of ice domains in a digital micrograph
to calculate the domain areas of each crystal.40 All data were plotted and analyzed using Microsoft Excel
to provide the MGS of the sample and a PBS control on the same day
of testing. The MGS of the sample was compared to that of the PBS
control to obtain the ice recrystallization inhibition activity, reported
as the percentage of the MGS (% MGS) relative to the PBS control.
A large % MGS represents larger ice crystals, which is indicative
of low IRI activity.

Blood Collection and Preparation
Canadian Blood Services
Network Centre for Applied Development (NetCAD) provided all whole
blood units, which were obtained in accordance with the standardized
phlebotomy guidelines approved by Canadian Blood Services (CBS). Experimental
protocols were approved by CBS and NetCAD, and ethics approvals were
obtained from the Research Ethics Board (REB) at CBS and the University
of Alberta. RBCs were obtained from whole blood units by centrifugation
at 4 °C and 2200g for 10 min, followed by removal
of the plasma supernatant and the buffy coat from the RBC pellet.
Pelleted RBCs were washed twice with the 0.2%/0.9% dextrose/saline
buffer, then resuspended in an equal volume of packed RBCs in the
0.2%/0.9% dextrose/saline buffer to a final hematocrit (Hct) of 0.50
L/L. Leukoreduced RBCs were stored refrigerated (4–6 °C)
in the buffer solution for up to 1 week.

RBC Freezing Experiments
Freezing solutions containing
carbohydrate compounds were prepared at twice the desired final concentration
in the 0.2%/0.9% dextrose/saline buffer. The freezing solution (150
μL) was added to 150 μL of leukoreduced RBCs for a final
volume of 300 μL. The final concentrations of all freezing solutions
are indicated in the text. After transfer to cryotubes, the RBC suspensions
were incubated for 10 min at room temperature, then immersed in a
methanol bath cooled to −5 °C. A glycerol sample with
a thermocouple was used as a control to measure the temperature of
the solution in 1 s intervals. Once the internal solution reached
−5 °C, ice nucleation was induced with forceps precooled
in liquid nitrogen and the samples were held at −5 °C
for 5 min. Slow freezing conditions were achieved by cooling at a
rate of 1 °C/min to −40 °C in a methanol bath, followed
by plunging the samples into dry ice (−80 °C) and storing
in a −80 °C mechanical freezer. Rapid freezing conditions
were achieved by plunging into dry ice (−80 °C) and storing
for a minimum of 30 min.

Thawing and Post-Thaw Hemolysis
Fast-thaw conditions
in a 37 °C water bath were used for all samples. Hcts and percentage
hemolysis were assessed immediately post-thaw for all samples. The
percentage post-thaw hemolysis (% hemolysis) was determined using
the cyanmethemoglobin Drabkin’s method by comparing the supernatant
hemoglobin concentration to total hemoglobin concentration.45,46 The percentage post-thaw RBC integrity was calculated using the
following equation: % post-thaw RBC integrity = 100% − % hemolysis.
Data for a minimum of four replicates for each condition are represented
as the mean post-thaw RBC integrity.

Ice Nucleation Inhibition
Assay
Compounds were assessed
for ice nucleation inhibition using the ice-nucleating agent silver
iodide (AgI) as previously described.47−49 Briefly, water-in-oil
(W/O) emulsions containing AgI particles were prepared by suspending
0.2 g of AgI in 4 mL of purified deionized (DI) water in a glass vial.
The suspension was sonicated for 60 min at room temperature and then
immediately filtered through a filter paper to remove large AgI particles
and aggregates, leaving only AgI particles of ≤3 μm in
diameter in the suspension. The aqueous solutions of each compound
(except β-pBrPh-Glc 9) were prepared at three times
the desired final concentration, and 1 mL of these aqueous solutions
or water (control) was mixed with 2 mL of the AgI suspension. The
aqueous solutions of 22 mM β-pBrPh-Glc 9 were prepared
at twice the desired final concentration because of the solubility
limitation, and 1.5 mL of this aqueous solution was mixed with the
same volume of the AgI suspension. The 3 mL mixtures were emulsified
in 6 mL of n-heptane containing 4 wt % SPAN 65 in
a glass vial. The ice nucleation temperature Tf was determined for each droplet of the W/O emulsion by observing
the freezing of the droplets by using optical microscopy. Before cooling,
the droplet diameter d was measured and the number
of AgI particles (NAgI) inside of the
droplet was counted. In this study, the data that satisfied 5 < d < 25 μm and 2 ≤ NAgI ≤ 8 were adopted.
