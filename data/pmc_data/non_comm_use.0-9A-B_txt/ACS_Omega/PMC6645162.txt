Biofortification
of crops to enhance provitamin A carotenoids
is a strategy to increase the intake where vitamin A deficiency presents
a widespread problem. Heat, light, and oxygen cause isomerization
and oxidation of carotenoids, reducing provitamin A activity. Understanding
provitamin A retention is important for assessing efficacy of biofortified
foods. Retention of carotenoids in high-xanthophyll and high-β-carotene
maize was assessed after a long-term storage at three temperatures.
Carotenoid retention in high-β-cryptoxanthin maize was determined
in muffins, non-nixtamalized tortillas, porridge, and fried puffs
made from whole-grain and sifted flour. Retention in eggs from hens
fed high-β-cryptoxanthin maize was assessed after frying, scrambling,
boiling, and microwaving. Loss during storage in maize was accelerated
with increasing temperature and affected by genotype. Boiling whole-grain
maize into porridge resulted in the highest retention of all cooking
and sifting methods (112%). Deep-fried maize and scrambled eggs had
the lowest carotenoid retention rates of 67–78 and 84–86%,
respectively.

Introduction
Vitamin A (VA) is a fat-soluble essential
micronutrient playing
critical roles in sight, cellular differentiation, development, and
immunity. VA deficiency is a global burden affecting an estimated
190 million preschool-aged children and associated with blindness
and increased mortality.1 Biofortification
with provitamin A carotenoids is a food-based strategy to combat VA
deficiency. Biofortified crops have been selectively bred to have
a greater carotenoid content, with special emphasis on β-carotene,
and are being disseminated in many African countries.2 Since 2013, biofortified hybrids are being grown in Zambia,
Nigeria, and Ghana,3−5 with recent releases in Malawi, Zimbabwe, and Tanzania.6,7 A high-β-carotene maize variety was as efficacious as a VA
supplement at increasing VA stores in Zambian children.8

In 2013, ∼1 billion metric tons
of maize was produced.9 Maize supplies
an estimated 800–1000 kcal/capita/day
in Mexico, Central America, Zambia, and other parts of Africa,9 providing about one-third of the total caloric
intake. Therefore, improving the nutritional quality of maize will
positively impact the micronutrient intake and potentially VA status.
In addition, egg consumption has increased globally. Nearly 65 million
metric tons of eggs were produced in 2013, providing 53–75
kcal/capita/day in South America, Mexico, and China.9 Biofortification of eggs with carotenoids through feeding
β-cryptoxanthin-enhanced maize to laying hens increases the
provitamin A content in yolk, suggesting that eggs may be a novel,
sustainable strategy to increase consumption.10 High-β-cryptoxanthin eggs are not yet available commercially.

The HarvestPlus Challenge Program’s target for provitamin
A content of biofortified maize is 15 μg β-carotene equiv/g
fresh weight [17 μg/g dry weight (DW)].11 Maize typically undergoes several processing steps postharvest for
consumption, such as cleaning, milling, storage, and cooking (Figure 1).12,13 Processing of grain disrupts the food matrix and increases bioaccessibility
of nutrients.14 However, exposure to heat,
light, and air causes isomerization and oxidation of carotenoids in
foods, reducing the amount in the final food.15

Figure 1 Major
processes and end products involved in raw kernel processing
(reproduced from Nuss and Tanumihardjo12).

Provitamin A degradation in many
genotypes of biofortified maize
grain may reach 60–65% when stored for 6 months under traditional
conditions.16−18 A 40% reduction in β-carotene equivalents occurred
during the first 2 weeks of maize kernel storage in ambient conditions
for four maize varieties.19 Retention also
depends on flour type, where coarser hammer meal retention (∼73%)
was higher than in finer refined meal (64–69%) after 4 months.13 β-Cryptoxanthin may be more stable than
β-carotene in some genotypes. The retention of carotenoids with
prolonged storage should be compared across several temperatures that
simulate household methods used in sub-Saharan Africa, Mexico, and
South and Central America.

Baking maize muffins resulted in
65–75% retention of carotenoids
compared with 52–60% retention after cooking porridge and 56–65%
after extrusion into corn puffs.20 In stiff
porridge, 78–129% of carotenoids were retained compared with
64–78% in thin porridge.21 Nixtamalized
maize retained 85–100% provitamin A as tortillas22 and 64% after deep-frying.23 However, only 20% retention occurred after frying flour
into tortilla chips.24 Because of the variation
in the methods and genotypes, additional retention and characterization
studies are needed on biofortified maize varieties that are being
introduced to alleviate VA deficiency, using typical household storage
conditions and processing methods. Furthermore, although several studies
have reported differing results of maize carotenoid retention, no
studies have investigated postcooking retention in β-cryptoxanthin-biofortified
eggs. Eggs contain a different food matrix that differs substantially
from that of maize, which may influence retention. This series of
studies evaluated carotenoid losses during storage in maize flour
and several household cooking methods using β-cryptoxanthin-biofortified
maize flour and β-cryptoxanthin-enhanced eggs.

Materials and
Methods
Preparation of Biofortified Maize Flour
For maize flour
storage, dried whole maize cobs from two maize genotypes, the KUI
synthetic high in xanthophylls (i.e., lutein and zeaxanthin) and F2
seed of the C17/DEexp F1 that is high in β-carotene (Table 1), were received from
the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and stored at −80
°C upon arrival. These two genotypes were selected due to high
carotenoid content and potential for implementation in breeding programs
to improve VA status in Zambia and other locations. These genotypes
were developed through conventional breeding and grown in Champaign,
Illinois. Kernels were removed from the cobs, ground using a C&N
hammer mill #8 (Christy-Norris, Ltd., Ipswich, U.K.), and sifted with
a 1 mm sieve.

and (Z)-β-carotenes.

A high-β-cryptoxanthin synthetic maize was used
to assess
carotenoid retention after household cooking. High β-cryptoxanthin
maize was conventionally bred at the International Maize and Wheat
Improvement Center through the HarvestPlus program and grown in Agua
Fria, Puebla, Mexico. Ears were harvested, dried, and stored at −20
°C prior to shipping as grain to University of Wisconsin—Madison.
Whole kernels were milled into course meal using a Meadows 8-in. stone-burr
mill in Lone Rock, WI. Mill stones were set 1.6 mm apart. All of the
ground material was manually sifted; the fraction that passed through
a 1.7 mm sieve was considered “whole-grain” or coarse
maize meal, and the fraction that passed through a 0.60 mm sieve was
considered “sifted” or refined maize meal. All of the
maize kernels and flour were stored at −30 °C for the
duration of this study.

Production of Biofortified Eggs
Biofortified eggs were
produced in Single Comb White Leghorn hens as previously described.25 All of the procedures involving animals were
approved by the University of Wisconsin—Madison College of
Agricultural and Life Sciences’ Animal Care and Use Committee.
Hen feed consisted of either biofortified high-β-cryptoxanthin
maize or white maize with freeze-dried tangerine peel (as a source
of β-cryptoxanthin) to produce feed equivalent in β-cryptoxanthin
content after saponification of the feed. Fresh eggs were collected
daily and stored in a conventional refrigerator at 2 °C in standard
cardboard or Styrofoam egg cartons until cooking.

Maize Flour
Storage
Maize carotenoid stability in flour
during storage was assessed at three temperatures and five sampling
times. The storage conditions included −20 °C freezer,
∼22 °C room temperature, and 37 °C simulated tropical
temperature in an oven. Maize flour was prepackaged into air- and
light-impermeable vacuum-sealed plastic bags using a Selovac vacuum
chamber (model 200B) and stored inside opaque secondary containers.
Maize flour was analyzed for carotenoids at time 0 to establish baseline
(Table 1) before transferring
the sealed bags to their respective long-term storage temperatures.
The individual bags were opened and analyzed in triplicate at 0.5,
1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 months.

Cooking Methods
Seven replicates of each recipe for
eggs and maize flour type were prepared. Retention of carotenoids
from biofortified maize was assessed in muffins, tortillas, thick
porridge, and deep-fried puffs made from whole-grain or sifted flour.
Household cooking methods for maize flour were selected because variants
of these foods are consumed across cultures worldwide. Aliquots of
uncooked and cooked maize dishes were weighed and then freeze-dried
using a VirTis benchtop lyophilizer (6K BT EL-85). Samples were again
weighed when dry and held at −80 °C until high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis.

For porridge, a typical
Zambian “nshima” recipe was used.26,27 Briefly, water (175 g) was brought to boil. An additional 25 g water
was added to 25 g cornmeal and stirred to form a paste, which was
added to the pot of boiling water and stirred. After 2 min, another
25 g maize meal was added. Porridge was stirred constantly for an
additional 8 min. The final temperature at the end of cooking was
95–98 °C.

A standardized muffin recipe was used
that included sugar, egg
white (yolks were discarded to not add other carotenoids to the muffins),
milk, peanut oil, salt, and baking powder to produce baked muffins
that weighed 48.4 ± 1.6 g. Muffins were baked for 14 min at 204
°C.

For each tortilla recipe, 63 g non-nixtamalized maize
meal was
mixed with 37.5 g water; from this mixture, 50 g spheres of dough
were formed and pressed in a tortilla press to 13 cm diameter, approximately
3 mm thick. Non-nixtamalized maize flour is used in unleavened flatbreads,
such as maize roti in Indian cuisine and arepa in South America (Figure 1). Tortillas were
cooked in a frying pan preheated to 150 °C for 1.5 min on each
side. Final temperature was 104–127 °C.

For maize
meal puffs, a standardized recipe was used including
sugar, egg white, milk, oil, and baking powder. Scoops of batter (15
g) were deep-fried individually in peanut oil for 3 min, turning periodically.
Oil temperature was maintained between 177 and 185 °C. Excess
oil was strained back into the pot. Frying oil was weighed before
and after cooking and used to adjust carotenoid content of puffs to
account for absorption of oil into the cooked food. Peanut oil was
chosen because it contains minimal carotenoids.28

Carotenoid retention in eggs from chickens fed either
biofortified
high-β-cryptoxanthin orange maize or white maize with tangerine
peel fortificant was assessed after frying, scrambling, boiling, and
microwaving. Eggs were chosen at random for each cooking treatment.
All of the eggs, except those that were hard-boiled, were cooked individually.
For scrambled eggs, whites and yolks were separated and weighed individually.
The yolks and whites were then whisked together and poured into a
nonstick skillet that had been preheated for 3 min. The eggs were
cooked for 3.5 min while the pan was tilted and scraped. Fried eggs
were cracked into a nonstick skillet that had been preheated for 3
min and were cooked for 3 min on each side. To microwave, whole eggs
without shells were placed in a microwave-safe glass dish and cooked
for 75 s on 50% power in a GE Profile 60 Hz household microwave oven
(Louisville, KY). To hard-boil the eggs, whole-shelled eggs were placed
in a single layer in a large pot and covered with 3–5 cm cold
water. Eggs were boiled for 10 min, cooled with running tap water
for 5 min, and peeled. Except for scrambled eggs, cooked yolks were
separated from whites. Cooked eggs and yolks were then placed in amber
vials, flushed with nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C.

Carotenoid Extraction and Analysis
All of the extraction
protocols were performed under yellow light to reduce photodegradation
of carotenoids. Maize flour and food samples were ground with a mortar
and pestle to a fine powder, and extracted using a modified method.29 Briefly, 6 mL ethanol with 0.1% butylated hydroxytoluene
as antioxidant was added to 0.5 g sample and incubated for 5 min at
85 °C. Samples were saponified with potassium hydroxide/water
(500 μL, 80:20, w/v) for 10 min, mixed every 5 min. The reaction
was quenched with 3 mL deionized water and mixed with a vortex. Two
hundred microliters of β-apo-8′-carotenal
was added after saponification as an internal standard to account
for mechanical losses. Carotenoids were extracted four times with
hexanes. Extracts were pooled, dried under nitrogen, reconstituted
in 500 μL 50:50 methanol/dichloroethane (v/v), and 50 μL
was injected into the HPLC system. Extraction efficiency ranged from
85 to 100%.

For egg extractions, 0.1–0.2 g microwaved,
hard-boiled, and fried yolks or 0.3–0.4 g scrambled eggs were
used. Two milliliters of Milli-Q water was added, mixed by vortex,
followed by 3 mL ethanol (0.1% butylated hydroxytoluene), and mixed.
Tubes were placed in a 60 °C water bath for 5 min, mixed by vortex,
and potassium hydroxide/water (700 μL, 30:70, w/v) was added.
Tubes were mixed and returned to the 60 °C water bath for 30
min, mixing every 15 min. Samples were immediately placed on ice and
3 mL cold deionized water was added and mixed. Two hundred microliters
of β-apo-carotenal was added to the samples
as an internal standard, mixed with a vortex, and 100 μL 2-propanol
was added. Carotenoids were extracted three times with 4 mL hexanes/ethyl
acetate (9:1). Organic layers were pooled, dried under nitrogen, reconstituted
with 500 μL 50:50 methanol/dichloroethane, and 50 μL was
injected into the HPLC system.

HPLC analysis for all of the
samples was conducted according to
a method used by Davis et al.30 The Waters
HPLC system was composed of a binary pump, autosampler, and photodiode
array detector (Milford, MA). A 40 min gradient system using two mobile
phases was employed, with solvent A consisting of methanol/water 92:8
(v/v) with 10 mmol/L ammonium acetate and solvent B consisting of
100% methyl-tert-butyl ether. The system was run
at 1 mL/min with solvent A at 70% transitioning to 40% over 30 min,
with a 10 min equilibration before the next injection. Chromatograms
were produced at 450 and 515 nm for quantification of carotenoids
and the β-apo-carotenal internal standard.
Efficiency of extraction was used to adjust the final carotenoid concentration
values. Standard curves were generated regularly for identification
and quantification of lutein, zeaxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin, α-carotene,
and β-carotene using HPLC-purified standards.

Percent
nutrient retention was calculated for each of the carotenoids
of interest on a dry weight (DW) basis according to the following
equation 1  

Statistical Analysis
Statistical
analysis was conducted
using SAS statistical software (version 9.4; SAS Institute, Cary,
NC) using Proc Mixed. Fisher’s least significant difference
(LSD) pairwise comparisons were used to compare the carotenoid content
and retention across storage treatments at final time point, across
maize milling and cooking methods, and across egg type and cooking
method. Confidence intervals for retention means were calculated for
each storage time point to determine significant differences from
100% at baseline.

Results
Maize Storage
Carotenoid retentions over time in the
high-xanthophyll and high-β-carotene maize flours are shown
in Figure 2 compared
with baseline values represented as 100%. Significant differences
in percent carotenoid retention across storage temperatures for each
line of maize were observed as early as 0.5 month, especially at 37
°C. Generally, carotenoid concentrations for both maize genotypes
decreased over time and were significantly different across all of
the storage temperatures at 12 months. Total carotenoid retention
varied by storage temperature as well as genotype, with the high-xanthophyll
maize retaining higher amounts of carotenoids as a percentage of the
original at all of the temperature conditions than the high β-carotene
maize. As expected, freezer storage at −20 °C resulted
in the highest retention of all of the carotenoids, followed by 22
and 37 °C, in both maize lines with little change in the high-xanthophyll
line and only a modest loss in provitamin A activity (<20% loss
at 12 months).

Figure 2 Effect of storage temperature and time on carotenoid degradation
in (A) high-xanthophyll maize (KUI synthetic) and (B) high-β-carotene
maize (C17/DEexp) flours. All of the values are shown as mean of three
determinations. Carotenoid retention was calculated by dividing carotenoid
concentration at each time point by baseline values. Significant changes
in carotenoid concentration from baseline were determined using 95%
confidence intervals, and are indicated with an asterisk. Different
letters indicate Fisher’s LSD-adjusted significant differences
(P < 0.05) in carotenoid retention between storage
temperatures for each graph.

Trendlines were developed to model carotenoid degradation.
Decay
of carotenoids in the high-xanthophyll maize followed a linear decay
model at 22 °C and a quadratic model at 37 °C. Decay of
carotenoids in the high-β-carotene maize occurred in two phases
for the 22 and 37 °C storage treatments. The first phase was
exponential lasting for 2 months followed by a linear decay for the
last 10 months. Decay of β-carotene in the high-xanthophyll
variety followed a quadratic decay model at 22 and 37 °C. Decay
of β-carotene in the high-β-carotene variety also occurred
in two phases as noted for total carotenoids. Decay of all of the
xanthophylls (i.e., lutein, zeaxanthin, and β-cryptoxanthin)
in the high-xanthophyll maize followed a linear model at 22 °C
and a quadratic model at 37 °C. Decay of all of the xanthophylls
(i.e., lutein, zeaxanthin, and β-cryptoxanthin) in the high-β-carotene
maize occurred in two phases as observed for total carotenoids. For
the first 2 months, decay was exponential, followed by linear decay.

Maize Flour Cooking
Carotenoid retention after cooking
the four maize foods prepared from high-β-cryptoxanthin maize
is shown in Table 2. The whole-grain maize flour had significantly higher lutein, zeaxanthin,
β-carotene, and total carotenoids compared with the sifted maize
flour; however, the flours did not differ in the β-cryptoxanthin
content. Total carotenoid retention was close to or exceeded 100%
across most food types, ranging from 67% (sifted flour puffs) to 112%
(whole-grain flour porridge). Carotenoid retention rates of >100%
are common19,21 and often attributed to better
extractability after processing. For porridge, puffs, and muffins,
the whole-grain maize retained a significantly higher proportion of
the original β-cryptoxanthin content compared with the sifted
flour versions of these foods. For β-carotene and β-cryptoxanthin,
but not lutein and zeaxanthin, there was a significant interaction
between cooking and milling methods, such that lower retention of
these provitamin A carotenoids was observed for sifted flour puffs
(86 and 88%, respectively) compared with whole-grain puffs (118 and
110%, respectively). Conversely, significantly lower retention of
lutein and zeaxanthin was observed after deep-frying for both flour
types, compared with the other cooking methods. Final carotenoid content
in the cooked foods differed significantly across all of the food
types of a given milling method, with porridge containing 33–44
nmol/g DW, followed by tortillas (27–35 nmol/g DW), muffins
(13–19 nmol/g DW), and puffs (9–10 nmol/g DW). (Note:
1 nmol β-carotene equivalents is 537 ng.)

by dividing the concentration (nmol/g DW) of each carotenoid species
in the raw maize food samples by carotenoid concentration (nmol/g

C Total carotenoids represents the
sum of the carotenoids quantified; lutein, zeaxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin,
and all-(E)-β-carotene.

Egg Cooking
Table 3 shows the carotenoid content of both biofortified
egg types, raw and cooked. Hen eggs accumulate xanthophyll carotenoids
better than it does hydrocarbons.25 Very
low amounts of α- and β-carotene were present in the eggs
from either biofortified maize-fed or tangerine peel-fed chickens,
i.e., ≤0.8 and ≤1.1 nmol/g DW for α- and β-carotene,
respectively. Thus, percent retention was not determined for these
carotenoids. For retention of total carotenoids, a significant main
effect of diet on retention was observed, with biofortified maize
eggs retaining higher concentrations of carotenoids after cooking
than tangerine peel-derived eggs, which contained <50% of total
carotenoids of the maize-derived eggs, for all of the cooking methods
excluding scrambling (Table 3). Values close to 100% retention were observed for all of
the egg cooking methods, with the exception of scrambling.

Discussion
This
study demonstrated significant effects of genotype and storage
temperature on carotenoid retention in maize, and differential effects
of several common cooking methods on carotenoid retention in biofortified
maize and β-cryptoxanthin-enhanced eggs. Depending on the cooking
method, carotenoids were well-preserved, as in the case of maize porridge,
or degraded as a result of cooking, such as after deep-frying. Retention
values greater than 100% after cooking could reflect changes in the
food matrix, with cooking leading to improved extractability of carotenoids,
or deactivation of oxidative enzymes that would degrade carotenoids,
rather than true increases in carotenoid content.

Regarding
carotenoid retention with storage temperature, genotypic
variation was observed as previously published.13,16,19 Significant differences in retention occurred
between the two genotypes and across storage conditions, with high
β-carotene maize exhibiting greater losses of carotenoids at
all of the storage conditions compared with high-xanthophyll maize,
and an inverse trend of carotenoid content with increasing temperature.
Even though the high β-carotene maize initially had higher amounts
of the provitamin A carotenoid, by 12 months at 37 °C storage,
both maize genotypes had less than 1 nmol/g of β-carotene, emphasizing
the importance of avoiding prolonged heat exposure when storing biofortified
maize flour. In both genotypes, decay occurred at a faster rate in
the first month and gradually plateaued; this is a similar pattern
to that observed by Mugode et al. and Ortiz et al. but different from
that observed by Burt et al., who noted relative stability of carotenoids
in high-carotentoid maize lines from 0 to 3 months and significant
degradation starting at 3–6 months.16,18,19 Genotype effects have also been observed
for provitamin A bioefficacy in Mongolian gerbils.31 Thus, during breeding and germplasm development, germplasm
exhibiting lower rates of degradation should be identified, and ideally,
maize genotypes close to release should be evaluated for both storage
and efficacy effects.

Xanthophyll content increased during −20
°C storage
in the high-xanthophyll maize line; Scott and Eldridge also observed
increases in maize carotenoid content after cold storage,32 which may preserve the enzymatic pathways for
biosynthetic carotenoid flux. Apparent retention values greater than
100% for one or more individual carotenoids were also observed for
porridge, puffs, and muffins. Processing and cooking maize flour may
separate carotenoids from the food matrix and increase their extractability
from the food, resulting in an apparent increase in their content.15 Higher carotenoid concentration in cooked foods
compared with the raw foods has been observed in sweet potato33 and maize food products previously.13,19,22

For porridge, tortillas,
and muffins, final carotenoid content
was higher in the coarser whole-grain versions of these foods compared
with the sifted maize meal versions. This finding suggests that milling
and sifting methods could be an important consideration to maximize
biofortification efforts targeting areas that consume large amounts
of maize. Coarser flours could potentially lead to greater amounts
of carotenoids in the final food products due to greater integrity
of the cellular components and decreased oxygen exposure.22 In this study, greater than 100% retention was
observed for carotenoids in maize porridge, higher than 86% retention
of β-carotene equivalents noted by Li et al.34 but similar to Mugode et al.19 who observed over 100% retention of β-carotene equivalents
after cooking provitamin A carotenoid biofortified maize into thin
and thick porridges. For tortillas and muffins, over 80% retention
of total carotenoids was documented, which is in contrast to Muzhingi
et al., who observed 30–50% retention of carotenoids after
baking yellow maize flour into muffins.35 Similar to the current results, Rosales et al. observed >80% retention of carotenoids in tortillas; however,
the
latter study used traditionally nixtamalized flour,22 which was not investigated in the current study.

The biofortified maize-derived eggs retained more carotenoids than
the tangerine-peel eggs, which may have been due to much higher concentrations
in the maize-derived eggs before cooking, even though the hen feeds
were equalized for β-cryptoxanthin concentration.25 Microwaving, hard-boiling, and pan-frying eggs
preserved carotenoids, whereas scrambling resulted in greater carotenoid
loss. Continuous agitation and loss of matrix integrity in combination
with high heat increases the surface area exposed to heat and atmospheric
oxygen, accelerating carotenoid loss in foods.13,22 Because scrambling retention differed significantly from pan-frying,
which used the same pan and stovetop conditions and twice the cooking
time, the process of scrambling decreased retention of carotenoids
between the two methods. Scrambling of biofortified eggs in areas
with VA deficiency should be discouraged if maximal carotenoid retention
is desired.

Deep-frying maize dough in hot oil into puffs resulted
in lower
total carotenoid retention and 86–110% β-carotene retention.
Other common names for this food are hush-puppies and fritters. It
was previously suggested that frying decreases carotenoid content
due to the high heat used, or leaching into the frying oil.36 Large carotenoid losses were also observed when
nixtamalized tortillas were fried to produce chips.23 Notably, the provitamin A carotenoids β-carotene
and β-cryptoxanthin were well-preserved relative to lutein and
zeaxanthin. However, the retention found with the maize puffs is slightly
higher than the 77–86% β-carotene retention reported
by Vimala et al. after frying orange-fleshed sweet potatoes.33

Different particle-sized maize products
are produced by milling
methods, improving digestibility and usability. In many sub-Saharan
countries, milling is accomplished using either hammer or roller mills.37 “Super meal” for porridge has
been produced previously for retention research by roller-milling
whole kernels and sifting out the <0.5 mm particle size fraction.21 Stone milling and grinding maize by hand (pounding)
is practiced as well; the latter being particularly important in rural
areas and situations where commercial milling services are not economically
feasible.37 Given the diversity of milling
and processing methods utilized worldwide, this study included flours
of two different particle-sized fractions; however, both whole-grain
meal and sifted meal were shown to have good retention of provitamin
A carotenoids, suggesting that sifting the maize flour prior to cooking
did not diminish subsequent provitamin A content of porridge. Furthermore,
hammer versus refined milling of biofortified high-β-carotene
maize did not affect the provitamin A bioefficacy in Mongolian gerbils.38 Because maize is milled in batches and stored
in flour form for varying time periods, additional studies need to
be done in milled, biofortified maize to understand the effect of
milling method and particle size on storage retention; although in
red pepper powder, coarse grinding resulted in greater retention of
carotenoids during cold storage.39 As genotype
affects the extent to which maize retains carotenoids with storage;
future studies should also probe the effect of maize genotype on carotenoid
retention from cooking biofortified maize and eggs.

In this
study, carotenoids were observed to degrade rapidly when
maize flour was stored at room temperature or above, emphasizing the
importance of the postmilling storage step in the processing of high-carotenoid
biofortified foods into the final consumed products. It is noteworthy
that biofortified maize and eggs retained >80% provitamin A carotenoids
with cooking, given that both of these foods are not widely consumed
in the raw state. Overall, lutein, zeaxanthin, and the provitamin
A carotenoids β-carotene and β-cryptoxanthin were retained
well after household cooking of biofortified maize and eggs into widely
consumed dishes with the exception of fried maize puffs. These findings
further support the likely effectiveness of the biofortification strategy
to increase consumption of provitamin A from maize and egg dishes.
