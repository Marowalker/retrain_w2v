NaTaO3 nanoparticles with a high surface area of 46.2
m2/g have been successfully synthesized using a polymeric
citrate precursor route. As-prepared nanoparticles were extensively
characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared, transmission
emission microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy studies for
the analysis of phase purity, crystallinity, and morphology. NaTaO3 nanoparticles show efficient photo-induced removal of the
methylene blue dye under sunlight, which were confirmed by using liquid
chromatography–mass spectroscopy. 86% dye has been degraded
in 200 min at neutral pH, whereas the same amount of dye was decolorized
in only 80 min at alkaline pH. Also, the dielectric behavior of the
as-prepared nanoparticles at different annealing temperatures was
explained by the Maxwell–Wagner polarization mechanism. At
500, 600, and 700 °C annealing temperatures, the dielectric constant
and dielectric loss at 500 kHz for the samples were found to be 21.5,
18, and 16 and 0.012, 0.022, and 0.029, respectively. The unsaturated
hysteresis loop shows weak ferroelectric behavior of NaTaO3 nanoparticles with remanent and saturation polarizations of 0.0013
and 0.21 μC/cm2, respectively, and S-E hysteresis
shows a bipolar strain of 0.10%.

1 Introduction
The
presence of residual dyes or organic moieties in untreated
or inefficiently treated effluents from the textile industries and
other industries is of great concern in the present scenario to the
scientific world. Therefore, the degradation of dyes using different
techniques like microwave, sonophotocatalysis, and photocatalysis
is considered as eco-friendly ways for remediation of the environment.1−4 However, among various environment-friendly techniques, photocatalysis
has attracted lot of attention in reducing the threats posed to the
environment. The removal of organic pollutants from wastewater is
prime application of photocatalytic phenomenon.5 Several organic and inorganic photocatalysts have been
employed for removal of organic dyes from wastewater. Among inorganic
photocatalysts, tremendous attention has been given to the metal oxide
nanoparticles due to their unique and enhanced catalytic activity
as compared to their bulk counterparts.6,7 Most of the
nanosized metal oxide nanoparticle photocatalysts are widely used
in semiconductor industry due to their less toxicity, high stability,
and low cost.8,9 The use of metal oxides as photocatalysts
has been uncovered by the prelude of TiO2 as a photocatalyst
in photocatalytic water splitting.10 Not
only metal oxides, few nanosized complex metal oxides such as ZnWO4, CuWO4, CuCrO2, and CoWO4 have shown significant photocatalytic and electrocatalytic performances.11−14 Later, different metal oxide nanoparticles like niobates and tantalates
were explored for their photocatalytic activity in water splitting
and removal of organic contaminants from water.15,16 NaTaO3, being an important member of tantalate perovskites,
has been explored extensively for its photocatalytic water splitting
activity due to its stability and structural flexibility. In the NaTaO3 structure, the corner sharing of TaO6 octahedron
forms a three-dimensional structure with sodium ions at dodecahedral
interspaces, which maintains the stability of the NaTaO3 structure.17 Apart from photocatalytic
application, NaTaO3 has also found application as a lead-free
piezoelectric ceramic and dielectric material.18

Another lead-free piezoelectric ceramic, sodium niobate
recently
developed by a citrate precursor route has shown enhanced electrocatalytic
and photocatalytic properties.19 Dielectric
materials with high permittivity (K) and piezoelectric
constant (d33) have shown immense importance
due to their applications in dielectrics, electronic devices, piezoelectric
sensors, actuators, and energy storage devices.20−23 Great efforts are being made
to develop high K, high d33, and low Curie temperature (Tc) materials.
Due to high dielectric and piezoelectric constant of ferroelectric
ABO3-type ceramics, particularly, PbTiO3-derived
materials have attracted tremendous attention from researchers to
understand the effect of composition, structure morphology, and surface
area on their functional properties.24,25 The functional
materials have facilitated the researchers to devote more attention
toward eco-friendly ferroelectric, piezoelectric, and dielectric materials
like BaTiO3, KNbO3, NaNbO3, and NaTaO3.18,26−29 Due to interesting and characteristic
ferroelectric properties, NaTaO3 has been widely used in
electroceramic industries.18

However,
the low light absorption ability and low charge separation
hinder NaTaO3 to act as an efficient photocatalyst. Similarly,
the less studied electrical properties of NaTaO3 nanoparticles
limit their practical application in different fields. Different factors
like the preparation method, higher crystallinity, different morphology,
crystallite size, less defects, and high surface area are being considered
to improve the photocatalytic activity and dielectric and piezoelectric
properties of NaTaO3 nanoparticles. High surface area would
lead to improved photocatalytic and electrical properties of NaTaO3 nanoparticles. To synthesize high-surface-area NaTaO3 nanoparticles for different applications, several methods
like sol–gel, hydrothermal, reverse micelles have been employed.15,30,31

In this work, we have used
a polymeric citrate precursor route
to prepare high-surface-area photocatalytically active, high-k NaTaO3 nanoparticles. XRD, FT-IR, TEM, and
SEM techniques were employed to characterize as-prepared nanoparticles.
Surface area evaluation was done by using the BET theory. The present
work intends to study the photocatalytic activity of the synthesized
nanoparticles. The detailed investigation for dielectric properties
of NaTaO3 nanoparticles was carried out with frequency
and temperature. The variation of dielectric properties of as-synthesized
nanoparticles at different annealing temperatures was also studied.
The piezoelectric properties of as-prepared nanoparticles were also
presented.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 X-ray
Diffraction (XRD) Analysis
XRD was used to extract the information
regarding crystallinity,
phase purity, and phase composition of as-synthesized NaTaO3. The X-ray diffraction pattern is shown in Figure 1, which clearly indicates that all the diffraction
peaks match closely with the orthorhombic phase of NaTaO3 as documented in JCPDS card no 73-0878. The position of the peaks
in the XRD pattern represents that the pure, monophasic, highly crystalline
NaTaO3 has been prepared by a polymeric citrate precursor
method. All the reflections in the XRD pattern corresponds to the
orthorhombic phase of the NaTaO3 sample with lattice parameters a = 5.5213, b = 7.7952, and c = 5.4842 Å and a space group of Pcmn. The
XRD reflections at 2θ (22.796°, 32.447°, 39.985°,
46.609°, 52.483°, 57.896°, 67.969°, 72.71°,
and 77.83°) correspond to (020), (121), (220), (040), (141),
(240), (242), (060) and (402) crystal planes, respectively, which
showed that no phase other than NaTaO3 was formed during
the reaction.

2.2 FTIR Studies
Figure 2 represents the FT-IR
spectra of the nanocrystalline
NaTaO3 sample. The characteristic peaks corresponding to
C–O stretching of citric acid, ethylene glycol, carboxylate
band, and metal carboxylate band were present in a region of 1400–1500
cm–1. The IR band at 3128 corresponds to the O–H
vibrations of the adsorbed water on the surface. The other peaks at
1100–1600 cm–1 confirm the formation of ester
linkage, and the bands at 1507, 1390, and 1226 cm–1 could be attributed to C–C, C=O, and C–O stretching,
respectively.32 In IR spectra, the strong
band observed at 2360 could be due to the atmospheric CO2.32 Further, the fingerprint peak responsible
for M–O vibrations was observed at 627 cm–1. This M–O band in the spectra was observed due to the Ta–O
stretching and Ta–O–Ta bridge stretching modes.18 The reason responsible for these bands is the
symmetric combination of Ta–O stretching modes in TaO6 octahedra.

2.3 Electron Microscopic Studies
TEM
analysis showed the formation of NaTaO3 nanoparticles as
shown in Figure 3a.
The appearance of dense agglomerated nanoparticles in the TEM micrograph
could be attributed to the high synthesis temperature, which could
lead to the grain diffusion and grain growth.33Figure 3b represents
the size distribution histogram of NaTaO3 nanoparticles
with size ranging from 20 to 140 nm having an average size of 70 nm.
The TEM analysis demonstrates that the size of the synthesized NaTaO3 can be successfully controlled in nanodimensions using a
polymeric citrate precursor route.

plot of NaTaO3 nanoparticles.

SEM measurements were carried out to elucidate the effect of annealing
temperature on the surface morphologies of the as-synthesized sodium
tantalate sample. Figure 4a–d represents the SEM micrographs of the as-prepared
sample and the samples annealed at 500, 600, and 700 °C, respectively.
It could be seen that highly agglomerated and dense nanoparticles
with irregular shapes were synthesized using a polymeric citrate precursor
route as shown in Figure 4a. It is also evident that the surface morphology of the as-prepared
sample changes with an increase in annealing temperature (Figure 4). At low annealing
temperature (500 °C), the separate particles with irregular shapes
are visible in Figure 4b, while with an increase in annealing temperature, more particle
segregation takes place, and the highest segregation of particles
could be observed in the sample annealed at 700 °C, which promotes
the grain diffusion phenomenon.

and the samples annealed at (b) 500 °C, (c) 600 °C, and
(d) 700 °C temperatures.

2.4 BET Surface Area Studies
Surface
area plays an important role in different properties like optical,
electrical, biological, catalysis, etc. of the material. Therefore,
before evaluating different properties of as-synthesized NaTaO3 nanoparticles, it becomes imperative to measure the surface
area of the sample. Generally, the materials with large surface area
provide more reaction and adsorption sites for catalytic processes
and also improve the transport of charge carriers on the surface,
which leads to enhanced photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants.34 Adsorption–desorption measurements were
carried out to establish the surface area of as-synthesized NaTaO3 nanoparticles as shown in Figure 5a. From Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area analysis, it was elucidated that synthesized nanoparticles
possess a high surface area of 46.2 m2/g compared to the
previous reports. Table 1 shows the comparison of surface area of synthesized sodium tantalate
nanoparticles with previously reported literature. The use of the
polymeric citrate precursor route for the synthesis of NaTaO3 controls the particle size in nanodimensions as observed in TEM
analysis. Due to the small size of the synthesized nanoparticles,
their surface-to-volume ratio increases, which results in the improved
surface area of the final product. Similarly, compared to other methods
like solid state, sol–gel, and precipitation, the use of the
polymeric citrate precursor route does not require high calcination
temperature to obtain the final product, which results in obtaining
the nanodimensional materials; therefore, the final product retains
the high surface area properties.29 From Figure 5a, it was observed
that NaTaO3 nanoparticles show the type III isotherm. Pore
radius of the NaTaO3sample was calculated by using the
Dubinin and Astakov (DA) plot as shown in Figure 5b, which corresponds to a pore radius of
12.5 Å. Figure 5c is the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) plot of synthesized
nanoparticles, which shows the average pore size distribution of the
sample centered at 22 Å.

2.5 Photocatalytic Degradation
Studies
Discharge of dyes mostly from textile industries
poses great risk
to the biotic and abiotic components of the ecosystem.34,35 These dye effluents from textile industries cause a great hurdle
for municipal waste water treatments. Under natural anaerobic degradation,
these dyes are converted to potentially carcinogenic amines. Therefore,
removal of dye-based effluents is recognized as a challenging task
by environmentalists. Different technologies including physical and
biological have been used for treatment of these dye effluents but
do not achieve much organic dye degradation.35 Semiconductors are considered as an important alternative useful
technology for successful removal of notorious organic dyes.13,15 Thus, to demonstrate the photocatalytic activity of NaTaO3 nanoparticles, the methylene blue (MB) dye was used as a target
pollutant. The UV–visible spectrum of MB along with NaTaO3 nanoparticles as a semiconductor photocatalyst showed a characteristic
peak at 663 nm. The change in intensity of the characteristic peak
of the MB dye was used to observe the degradation process at different
time intervals. Similar experiments were carried out without a catalyst
or sunlight, which show negligible degradation, thus confirm that
the degradation is truly carried out by a photocatalytic process.
The photocatalytic degradation process of the MB dye was studied at
neutral and alkaline pH as shown in Figures 6a,b, respectively. The peak intensity at
663 nm shows a decrease from 1.7 to 0.41 in 200 min at neutral pH
(Figure 6a), whereas
in alkaline pH, it decreases from 1.14 to 0.4 in 80 min as shown in Figure 6b. The characteristic
peak of the MB dye shows appreciable reduction in the presence of
the NaTaO3 semiconductor photocatalyst. From the MB degradation
studies, it was observed that the synthesized NaTaO3 nanoparticles
show enhanced photocatalytic activity as compared to the already reported
NaTaO3 photocatalyst.36 In previous
report, the NaTaO3 photocatalyst shows only 50% removal
of the organic dye in 6 h36 while the as-prepared
sample removes almost 86% MB dye in only 200 and 80 min at neutral
and alkaline pH, respectively. Figure 7a,b depicts the photocatalytic efficiency of NaTaO3 nanoparticles at neutral and alkaline pH, respectively. By
comparing the photocatalytic efficiency at different pHs, it was observed
that NaTaO3 nanoparticles show efficient activity at alkaline
pH with a removal of 86% MB dye in only 80 min; however, the degradation
process takes more time (200 min for 86% dye removal) in a neutral
medium. The change in photocatalytic activity with respect to pH could
be explained on the basis of the isoelectric point of NaTaO3. It has been reported in the literature that the isoelectric point
of NaTaO3 was calculated to be 3.5 and, above isoelectric
point, NaTaO3 has OH– ions adsorbed on
its surface, which increases with an increase in pH of the solution.
Hence, MB being the cationic dye shows increased adsorption on the
catalyst surface as pH is increased. The increased adsorption of the
MB dye on active sites results in the enhanced activity of NaTaO3 nanoparticles at alkaline pH. The increased photocatalytic
activity of the NaTaO3 nanoparticles compared to the previous
reports could be attributed to the high surface area of as-prepared
NaTaO3 nanoparticles using a polymeric citrate precursor
route.

2.5.1 Kinetics of Degradation
The degradation
of organic waste in water mostly follows the Langmuir–Hinshelwood
mechanism. The integral kinetic equation for the mechanism is written
as follows  where C0 is the
concentration (mol L–1) of the reactant at time t = 0, C (mol L–1) is
the concentration of the reactant after time t, and R is the apparent rate constant of the pseudo-first-order
photocatalytic reaction. To determine the kinetics of the degradation
process in neutral and alkaline media, the calculations were fitted
to a pseudo-first-order model. It was found that the plot of logarithm
of relative concentration of the MB dye versus time for the NaTaO3 photocatalyst produces almost a linear plot confirming that
the degradation process follows the pseudo-first-order kinetics. The
apparent rate constant of the degradation process calculated from
the plot of ln C0/C versus
irradiation time as shown in Figure 8 is used to compare the photocatalytic activity of
NaTaO3 nanoparticles in neutral and alkaline media. It
was observed that NaTaO3 nanoparticles show best photocatalytic
activity in the alkaline medium compared to the neutral medium (Figure 8). The rate constant
of the MB degradation process using NaTaO3 nanoparticles
as the catalyst was calculated to be 0.00895 and 0.2247 min–1 in neutral and alkaline media, respectively.

in (a) neutral and (b) alkaline media.

2.5.2 Mechanism of Photocatalysis
To
understand the mechanism of photocatalytic degradation of MB using
NaTaO3 nanoparticles as the catalyst, several scavengers
were used to identify the active species taking part in the degradation
process. Benzoquinone was used as a scavenger to quench the catalytic
process carried out by O2·– active species, and other scavengers like AgNO3, ammonium
oxalate, and isopropanol were used to quench the catalytic processes
carried out by e–, h+, and OH·, respectively. All the quenchers were added to the MB dye solution
before addition of the NaTaO3 nanoparticles in both neutral
and alkaline media. It was observed that different scavengers reduce
the photocatalytic activity to a different extent. From quenching
studies, the more the activity of the photocatalyst is reduced by
any scavenger, the more important is the oxidizing species in the
MB degradation process. Figure 9a,b represents the photodegradation of MB in the presence
of the oxidizing species scavenger in neutral and alkaline media.
It was observed that photocatalytic activity of NaTaO3 is
reduced substantially with addition of AgNO3, isopropanol,
and benzoquinone as scavengers at different pHs, while little activity
was reduced when ammonium oxalate was used as a scavenger. From the
findings in Figure 9a,b, we confirmed that after involving electrons and superoxide radicals,
OH· plays an important role in degradation of the
MB organic dye. Although at both neutral and alkaline pH, the extent
of quenching was different, but the quenching behavior of different
quenchers was the same. Based on the above results, we propose the
following reaction mechanism for the photocatalytic degradation process
in both neutral and alkaline pH              where eCB– is
the electron in the conduction band and hVB+ is the hole in the valance band.

activity of NaTaO3 nanoparticles in (a) neutral and (b)
alkaline media.

2.5.3 Degradation
Pathway Studies
Apart
from the UV–visible studies, the degradation of the MB organic
dye was further confirmed by LC–MS studies. The dye sample
with least intensity in the UV–vis spectrum was taken for LC–MS
analysis. Figures S1 and S2 represent the
mass spectra of the dye samples after degradation in neutral and alkaline
media, respectively. LC–MS of the dye sample revealed different
fragments formed during the photocatalytic reaction in neutral (Figure 10a) and alkaline
media (Figure 10b).
The structure of different fragments corresponding to different m/z values was elucidated with the help
of the Chemidraw structural tool. The intermediate degradation product
formed in a neutral medium with their corresponding molecular structures
and m/z values is presented in Figure 10a while the corresponding
molecular structures and m/z values
of degradation fragments formed at alkaline pH are shown in Figure 10b. At neutral pH,
the intermediates revealed that the degradation process proceeds via
attack of ·OH radical on MB followed by cleavage of the —N=C—
bond and —S=C— bond, which could be attributed
to the easy cleavage of the π-bond. The attack of ·OH on
the MB dye at neutral pH produces 3,7-bis(dimethylamino)-1,4,9-trihydroxyphenothiazin-5-ium
coded as (U-1, m/z 331.7);
after the formation of U-1, the breakdown of —N=C—
occurs resulting in the formation of (Z)-(2-amino-5-(dimethylamino)-3-hydroxyphenyl)(E)-3-hydroxy-5-(methylimino)cyclohex-3-en-1-ylidene)sulfonium
(U-2, m/z = 307.1).
Similarly, different fragments like N-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)acetamide
(U-3, m/z = 165), N1-methylbenzene-1,4-diamine (U-4m/z 124.9), and 3-aminophenol
(U-5m/z 111.1) were
obtained from the cleavage of U-2 (Figure 10 a).

of MB dye in presence of NaTaO3 photocatalyst
at (a) neutral and (b) alkaline pH.

Figure 10 b represents
the fragmentation process of MB dye solution in the presence of NaTaO3 nanoparticles under alkaline conditions, which was deduced
from LC–MS studies (Figure S2).
In an alkaline medium, it was observed that the photodegradation of
MB occur through the n-dealkylation reaction of aliphatic amine resulting
in the formation of T1 with an m/z value of 270.2. The n-dealkylation reaction of tertiary
aliphatic amine is further followed by second and third n-dealkylation
of aliphatic amine groups resulting in the formation of T2 with an m/z value of 242.4. The
further fragmentation process results in the formation of T3, T4, T5, and T6 with m/z values equal to 183.1, 151.1, 137.1,
and 118.9, respectively.

2.6 Electrical
Properties
2.6.1 Dielectric Properties
The detailed
investigation of variation of dielectric constant (ε) and dielectric
loss (D) of NaTaO3 nanoparticles annealed
at different temperatures (500, 600, and 700 °C) with frequency
and temperature has been carried out as shown in Figures 11–13. The variation of ε and D of NaTaO3 nanoparticles annealed at 500, 600,
and 700 °C with frequency ranging from 20 Hz to 1 MHz at 100
°C is shown in Figure 11a–c, respectively. It could be seen that at lower frequency,
the sample annealed at 500, 600, and 700 °C shows a nonlinear
decrease in dielectric constant with frequency at 100 °C. This
frequency dependency of dielectric constant is known as dielectric
dispersion.37 Such behavior can be explained
by the dipole relaxation phenomenon. At low frequencies, the space
charges have an adequate amount of time to follow the frequency of
the applied field and undergo the relaxation process, whereas at higher
frequencies, these space charges are not able to undergo the relaxation
process. This dielectric behavior can be primarily explained by Maxwell–Wagner
polarization or space charge polarization relaxation induced by applied
bias.32 Similar observations were made
in the case of dielectric loss, that is, with an increase in frequency,
dielectric loss also shows large dispersion at low frequency and remains
constant at higher frequencies. From the results, it is observed that
with an increase in frequency, the value of dielectric loss decreases,
and this behavior of dielectric loss could be explained by Koop’s
phenomenological theory.38

Figure 11 Variation of dielectric
constant and dielectric loss with frequency
(at 100 °C) of NaTaO3 nanoparticles annealed at (a)
500 °C, (b) 600 °C, and (C) 700 °C.

(a) 500 °C, (b) 600 °C, and (c) 700 °C.

Figure 13 Variation of dielectric constant and dielectric loss of NaTaO3 nanoparticles with annealing temperatures.

Further, the dependence of dielectric properties of the NaTaO3 nanoparticles across a temperature range of 50–500
°C was measured at 500 kHz as shown in Figure 12a–c. It is observed from the temperature
dependence of dielectric constant results that with an increase in
temperature, the dielectric constant showed high stability up to 250
°C, and with a further increase in temperature, dielectric constant
increases up to 400 °C for the samples annealed at 500 and 600
°C; however, beyond this, temperature dielectric constant decreases
as shown in Figure 12a,b, respectively. This decrease in dielectric constant above 400
°C may be attributed to the phase transition of NaTaO3 nanoparticles.39 At about 400 °C,
the room-temperature orthorhombic structure with a space group Pbnm changes to orthorhombic geometry with a space group Cmcm.(39) The sample annealed at
700 °C shows less stable and low dielectric constant with respect
to temperature at 500 kHz. The sample annealed at 700 °C does
not show this decrease in dielectric constant above 400 °C. Similarly,
dielectric loss of all the samples is also strongly dependent on temperature
as shown in Figure 12a–c. The stable dielectric constant up to 250 °C and
comparable low dielectric loss of as-prepared NaTaO3 nanoparticles
annealed at 500 °C provide the promising solution for high-temperature
dielectrics.

The stable dielectric constant at 500 kHz of NaTaO3 samples
annealed at 500, 600, and 700 °C was found to be 21.5, 18, and
16, respectively, as observed in Figure 12. From previous reports, it was observed
that annealing temperature strongly affects the dielectric properties
of the material.40Figure 13 represents the annealing temperature versus
dielectric properties plot measured at 500 kHz at 100 °C. From
the plot, it can be observed that dielectric constant decreases with
an increase in annealing temperature and dielectric loss increases
with an increase in annealing temperature as shown in Figure 13. From the results, it is
observed that NaTaO3 nanoparticles annealed at 500 °C
show a dielectric constant of 21.5 and dielectric loss of 0.012 at
100 °C and 500 kHz. The decrease in dielectric constant with
an increase in annealing temperature can be attributed to a decrease
in particle size of the nanoparticles as is observed in SEM results
of the samples annealed at different temperatures discussed earlier
in the manuscript. The decrease in dielectric constant with an increase
in annealing temperature may be due to the decrease in density of
the packing grains in the samples annealed at higher temperatures
as observed in SEM micrographs.27 Also,
as per conductivity model, the conductivity of the material is controlled
by the defect sites present in the sample. With an increase in annealing
temperature, the number of defects present in the material is decreased,
which results in a decrease of conductivity of the materials. Therefore,
with an increase in annealing temperature, the conductivity of the
material is decreased; hence, dielectric constant also decreases with
an increase in the annealing temperature.19

2.6.2 AC Conductivity Studies
Figure 14 represents the
variation of electrical conductivity with frequency of the three samples
annealed at different temperatures, which was employed to understand
the relaxation process taking place in synthesized nanoparticles.
It is clear from the figure that with an increase in operating temperature
and frequency, the conductivity of all the samples increases. In general,
the increase in the ac conductivity in dielectric materials is attributed
to the increase in mobility of electrons or other charge carriers.41 At lower temperatures, the conductivity of NaTaO3 nanoparticles is almost independent on frequency, which is
due to low thermal energies of the electrons and hence do not take
part in the conduction process. However, at high temperature, the
thermal energies of the electrons are sufficient enough to cross the
grain boundaries, which lead to high mobility of the electrons and
hence increase the conductivity of the material.42,43 The mechanism of conductivity was explained by using fitting of
power law (σ = Aωη)
where the value of “η” determines the mechanism
responsible for conductivity. For η > 1, the conductivity
follows
the Maxwell–Wagner relaxation process while for η <
1, conductivity shows the correlated barrier hopping (CBH) mechanism.42 From the fitting of power law, the values of
“η” obtained were greater than 1; therefore, the
conduction follows the Maxwell–Wagner relaxation process.

change of ac conductivity with frequencies (at 100 °C)

2.6.3 Piezoelectric Properties
The presence
of distortion in the lattice structure of perovskites is mainly responsible
for many interesting electrical properties, like ferroelectricity
and relaxor behavior. Keeping in view of the fact of the distortion
in NaTaO3 nanoparticles from a perfect perovskite structure,
P-E studies were performed. The P-E measurements at 1 Hz for NaTaO3 nanoparticles annealed at 500 °C showed a narrow and
unsaturated hysteresis loop as shown in Figure 15a. The remanent polarization Pr and saturation polarization Ps for the sample were found to be 0.0013 and 0.21μC/cm2, respectively, with a coercive field of −3.245 kV/cm as shown
in the inset of Figure 15a. The presence of the P-E loop (though unsaturated) is the
conclusive evidence for the sign of ferroelectric properties in as-prepared
NaTaO3 nanoparticles. It is also evident that NaTaO3 nanoparticles have incomplete saturation of the hysteresis
loop (Figure 15a),
showing that domains are still growing in the synthesized nanoparticles.44 Such a type of unsaturated behavior is due to
weak ferroelectric properties of the material and therefore needs
higher fields to switch the domain polarization. In perovskite ferroelectrics,
the atomic displacements during the switching polarization result
in the polarity changes in the lattice via a displacement mechanism,
which is the main reason for ferroelectric behavior of perovskite
materials.45 The P-E measurements of NaTaO3 nanoparticles also show some lossy character as there is
a break in the P-E hysteresis loop in the as-prepared nanoparticles
(Figure 15a). The
lossy character of the sample may be attributed to the band structure
of the NaTaO3. It is reported in the literature that the
semiconductor ferroelectrics have high chances to undergo the leakage
losses compared to the insulator ferroelectrics.46

Figure 15 (a) P-E hysteresis and (b) S-E butterfly loops of as-prepared
NaTaO3 nanoparticles.

To the best of our knowledge, the piezoelectric property of the
pristine NaTaO3 nanopowder was investigated for the first
time using a converse piezoelectric technique. The strain-electric
field (S-E) loop measurement was carried out at 40 kV/cm as shown
in Figure 15b, which
exhibits piezoelectric displacement from NaTaO3 nanopowder
under the application of bipolar voltage. A typical butterfly loop
was observed under bipolar voltage, which is the characteristic feature
of ferroelectric materials at ambient temperature. As the applied
voltage crosses coercive voltage, the butterfly loop is formed due
to the polarization direction reorientation in the ferroelectric materials.47 The maximum strain under bipolar voltage was
found to be 0.10% for NaTaO3 nanoparticles. The synthesized
nanoparticles exhibited polarization and switching hysteresis, which
show the presence of the piezoelectric property. The strain % present
in the nanosized NaTaO3 is not too high as compared to
the other perovskite materials like lead-based piezoelectric materials
but is comparable to many lead-free-based piezoelectric ceramics such
as (1 – x)(K0.48Na0.52)(Nb0.95–y–zTazSby)O3–xBi0.5(Na0.82K0.18)0.5ZrO3.48 It has been observed that there are different factors, which are
responsible for the outstanding piezoelectric performances of the
materials. Among all these factors, the microstructure plays an important
role in enhancing the piezoelectric response of the synthesized materials.
During the polling process, the nanorange domain wall energy results
in the polarization rotation, which in turn results in the enhanced
piezoelectric performance. Therefore, the nanodimensional domains
of NaTaO3 could be the possible reason for its reasonable
piezoelectric strain. As a result, high-surface-area NaTaO3 nanoparticles are an effective photocatalyst with high dielectric
constant and low dielectric loss and show comparable piezoelectric
strain with respect to many lead-free piezoelectric materials.

3 Conclusions
High-surface-area nanosized NaTaO3 was fabricated by
a polymeric citrate precursor route. X-ray diffraction study confirms
the monophasic and highly crystalline nature of as-prepared NaTaO3 nanoparticles. The photocatalytic activity of NaTaO3 nanoparticles was investigated by using the methylene blue dye as
the model pollutant. The presence of large-surface active sites results
in the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the nanoparticles in both
neutral and alkaline media. The degradation of 86% methylene blue
dye was achieved in 200 min at neutral pH; however, in alkaline pH,
it takes only 80 min. The results showed that NaTaO3 nanoparticles
with high surface area could act as a better photocatalyst under sunlight
irradiation at alkaline pH. Sodium tantalate nanoparticles annealed
at 500 °C show enhanced stable dielectric properties with a dielectric
constant of 21.5 and dielectric loss of 0.012 at 500 kHz. Also, the
material shows great temperature stability of dielectric properties
up to 250 °C over a frequency range of 20 Hz to 1 kHz. An increase
in the annealing temperature leads to the decrease in dielectric properties
due to segregation of nanoparticles. In addition to dielectric properties,
ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties of nanoparticles were also
studied. It was observed that pristine NaTaO3 nanoparticles
show a reasonable piezoelectric response (0.10% bipolar strain) as
compared to many lead-free piezoelectric materials. As-prepared NaTaO3 nanoparticles with high surface area could be used in efficient
photocatalysis and efficient energy storage capacity devices having
a reasonable piezoelectric property for development of the lead-free
piezoelectric materials.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
The chemicals used are
citric acid monohydrate (C6H8O7·H2O, Merck, 99%), ethylene glycol (C2H6O2, SRL), sodium hydroxide (NaOH, Merck, 97%) as the Na
source, Tantalum oxide (Ta2O5, Alfa Aesar, 99.9985%)
as Ta source, silver nitrate (AgNO3, Alfa Aesar, 99.5%),
benzoquinone (Merck, 97%), ammonium oxalate (Merck), and isopropanol
(RANKEM, 99%). Methylene blue (MB) (C16H18ClN3S.xH2O, Merck) was used as the model pollutant.
All the chemicals except citric acid were used as such without any
further treatment. Citric acid was dried in an oven before it was
used for the reaction.

4.2 Synthesis of Sodium Tantalate
Nanoparticles
Nanosized NaTaO3 with high surface
area was synthesized
by a polymeric citrate precursor route using Ta2O5 and NaOH in a molar ratio of 1:1. Ta2O5 (0.1
mol) was dispersed in water followed by addition of ethylene glycol
(EG) and citric acid (CA) in the molar ratio of EG/metal ion/CA as
10:1:40. After 2 h stirring at room temperature, 0.1 mol of NaOH solution
was added to the reaction mixture. The reaction content was stirred
and heated at 60 °C until a viscous gel is formed. To evaporate
the whole solvent, the reaction mixture was heated at 135 °C
for 12 h in a muffle furnace. The temperature of the furnace was further
increased to 300 °C for 2 h to get the charred black mass precursor.
After cooling naturally, the black mass precursor was crushed to fine
powder using a mortar pestle. To remove the excess carbonaceous content,
the charred precursor powder was heated at 700 °C for 12 h to
get the final product. The detailed mechanism of the synthesis procedure
is discussed somewhere else.15 Prior to
use for further analysis, the obtained powder was again ground using
a mortar and pestle. The whole reaction scheme is summarized in Figure S3.

4.3 Characterization
X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns of synthesized NaTaO3 nanoparticles were
obtained using a powder X-ray diffractometer (Rikagu Japan) using
Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiations with λ = 1.540 Å in
a 2θ range of 10–80°, and the step size for the
XRD studies was 0.05 °/s. FT-IR of nanoparticles was recorded
on an Affinity-1 Shimadzu FT-IR spectrophotometer by using nanoparticles
with KBr pellets. Origin 8.5 software was used to analyze the structural
parameters. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was employed to
take TEM micrographs of the sample to elucidate the particle size
and morphology. TEM micrographs were obtained using an FEI Tecnai
G20 HRTEM. Sample preparation was done by drop casting of the dispersed
sample onto a copper grid coated with carbon and was air-dried before
mounting on a microscope. The accelerating voltage used for TEM studies
was 200 kV. To probe the effect of annealing temperature on the surface
morphologies of the synthesized nanoparticles, scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) measurements were performed. SEM measurements were performed
with the aid of NOVA FE-SEM at an operating accelerating voltage of
20 kV. Prior to analysis, a small amount of dry sample was mounted
on a carbon tape coated with an ultrathin layer of gold to prevent
the surface charging effect. The SEM micrographs were observed at
magnification of 50,000 to their original size. A Quantachrome surface
area analyzer having model no. Nova 2000e was employed to measure
the surface area of the as-synthesized sample. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area studies of the synthesized nanoparticles were studied
using multipoint nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm measurements.
The isotherm conditions were obtained by using liquid nitrogen temperature
(≈77 K). In addition to surface area, pore radius and pore
size distribution of as-prepared NaTaO3 nanoparticles were
also elucidated using BET studies.

Dielectric measurements of
the NaTaO3 sample were analyzed in air over a temperature
range from 50 to 500 °C with a frequency of 20 Hz to 1 MHz. An
HF-LCR meter from Wayne Kerr Electronics (U.K., 6500 P) was used for
the analysis of dielectric measurements. Dependence of the polarization
hysteresis loop on strain-field S-E and electric field P-E was investigated.
The S-E and P-E loop measurements were carried out using aixACCT System
GmbH. Disk-shaped pellets with a diameter of 8 mm and thickness of
0.5 mm were used to carry out all the electrical measurements. The
pellets were prepared by using 5% poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) as a binder
and applying a uniaxial pressure of 5 tons by using a KBr press hydraulic
machine (Model M-5, Technosearch Instruments). For dielectric measurements,
the pellets were annealed at different temperatures ranging from 500
to 700 °C to find the effect of annealing temperature on dielectric
properties of NaTaO3. For P-E and S-E loop studies, the
pellet was annealed at 500 °C. Silver paste (Ted Pella, Inc.)
was used to develop a thin layer over the surface of pellets to form
a conducting contact.

4.4 Photocatalytic Studies
Photocatalytic
activity of as-synthesized nanoparticles was elucidated by using the
methylene blue (MB) dye as a model pollutant. During the study, an
aqueous stock solution of MB with a concentration of 1 × 10–5 M was prepared. In 50 mL of the dye solution, 20
mg of nanoparticles was dispersed and was kept in the dark for 1 h
to obtain the adsorption–desorption equilibrium between the
NaTaO3 nanocatalyst and the dye. The dye–catalyst
suspension was then exposed to the sunlight irradiation to initiate
the photocatalytic degradation reaction. After every 10 min, adequate
aliquots were taken and centrifuged to remove the suspended catalyst
particulates for analysis. Similar experiments were carried out either
in the dark or without a catalyst to confirm that the degradation
process is solely photocatalytic driven. The efficiency of the catalyst
for the photodegradation process was monitored by a change in intensity
of the characteristic absorption peak of MB at ≈664 nm using
a T-80 UV/vis spectrometer (PG Instruments Ltd.). The percentage removal
of the dye was computed by using following equation  where Ci is the
initial concentration of the MB dye after the adsorption–desorption
equilibrium before irradiation and Cf is
the concentration of the dye after time interval t (in minutes). To find out whether the dye has been degraded or not,
liquid chromatography–mass spectroscopy (LC–MS) of the
dye solution was carried out. Mass spectral studies were carried out
by using an API 2000 Applied Biosystem LCMS/MS/MS instrument.

To elucidate the mechanism of photocatalytic degradation of MB using
as-synthesized NaTaO3 under sunlight irradiation, trapping
experiments were carried out. Controlled experiments were carried
out in similar fashion as that of dye degradation except addition
of (10 mM) scavenger species to the MB dye solution before addition
of the NaTaO3 photocatalyst. To explore the active species
responsible for photocatalytic degradation of the MB dye, ammonium
oxalate, AgNO3, benzoquinone, and isopropanol were used
as scavengers for holes (h+), electrons (e–), superoxide radical anions (O2·–), and hydroxyl radical (OH·), respectively.
