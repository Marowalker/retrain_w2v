This
paper reports a novel glass fiber membrane with an effective
antibacterial performance by chemical grafting of quaternary ammonium
salt (QAS) which is enhanced by a plasma bombardment technique. Plasma
bombardment as a pretreatment of the membrane can increase the QAS
anchored on the membrane from 0.8 to 1.3 wt %. The chemical grafting
technique can increase the membrane zeta potential from negative values
to positive values in aqueous solutions at various pHs. Furthermore,
the plasma-enhanced chemical-grafting membrane has more positive zeta
potentials (49.0 mV at pH = 7) than the chemical-grafting membrane
without the plasma bombardment technique (38.9 mV at pH = 7). In the
antibacterial performance evaluation, the Escherichia
coli survival rate decreased from 127.0% of the pristine
membrane to 4.1 and 11.3% of the plasma-enhanced chemical-grafting
membrane and the chemical-grafting membrane, respectively. In addition,
the plasma-enhanced chemical-grafting membrane shows durable antibacterial
activity against E. coli with copious
water rinsing as much as 3 L·cm–2.

Introduction
In the past decays, many water purification
techniques are investigated
and applied to provide clean and safe drinking water, among which
the antibacterial technique is one of the most studied methods.1 For example, heavy metal cations (Ag+, Cu2+, etc.) and ultraviolet (UV) are currently widely
used2,3 for disinfection. The heavy metal cations
can inhibit bacteria reproduction by damaging the cytomembrane. In
fact, the antibacterial properties of silver and silver compounds
have been used since antiquity.2 Silver
cations can be adsorbed onto the negative bacterial cytomembrane due
to the Coulombic force and then react with thiol groups (−SH)
to destroy membrane proteins, leading to bacterial lysis.4,5 The UV sterilization is another scenario. With high photon energy,
the UV light can kill the bacteria by breaking the double helix structure
of DNA or inactivating proteins.6 However,
the above two typical techniques have weaknesses apparently. First,
although the heavy metal cations with a low content (ex. several ppb
of Ag+) can effectively inhibit bacteria, the heavy metal
cations in drinking water are also toxic to human cells.7 Second, although the UV sterilization is quick
and efficient, special protections should be equipped to avoid UV
leakage.6 In addition, the bacterial dwellings
inside water cleaning facilities, for example, activated carbon and
filtration membranes cannot be disinfected because of UV blockage
by the materials.

Because the benzalkonium chloride showed a
performance of skin
disinfection, the antibacterial role of the cationic surfactants was
discovered, among which the quaternary ammonium salt (QAS) was a typical
member.8−18 As one of the QAS, the 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyldimethyloctadecyl
ammonium chloride (TPMMC) was used in this research and the molecular
structure is shown in the Scheme 1. As the core cation of the QAS molecule, N+ is covalently bonded with two methyl groups, one octadecyl group
and one 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl group, exhibiting a positive Coulombic
property. The antibacterial mechanism of the QAS is proposed as follows.
First, due to negative charging of the bacterial cytomembrane, the
bacteria can be adsorbed onto the QAS molecules driven by Coulombic
interaction. Second, the cations pin the QAS molecules to the bacterial
cytomembrane, and then the hydrophobic and lipophilic group of the
QAS, as the octadecyl group in the TPMMC, can disrupt the cytomembrane
and penetrate into the bacteria for releasing potassium ions and other
cytoplasmic inclusions to lead cell death.1,18 Theoretically,
a single QAS molecule can disrupt a bacterium. However, a number of
QAS molecules anchored onto a substrate can function as a polycationic
agent to improve the antibacterial performance for two reasons.1 First, the polycations facilitate the adsorption
of the bacteria onto the QAS antibacterial agent because of a higher
positive charge density of the agent than that of the monomeric cations.1,18 Second, the nonfixed small QAS molecules can raise health concerns.1,19 Usually, the QAS molecule has a jointing group on the N+ for binding the QAS molecule to the substrate. For example, the
3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl group in the TPMMC work as a linkage to
graft the QAS organic molecule to a polymer or inorganic substrate
by forming O–Si covalent bonds. Therefore, the substrate with
the TPMMC antibacterial agent can both strengthen Coulombic attraction
to the bacteria and reduce the concern of dissolving small QAS molecules
into drinking water. Currently, many techniques for grafting the QAS
molecules onto a suitable substrate are intensively studied.2,9,13,18 For typical examples, surface activation by acid and alkaline is
normally used to clean inorganic substrates and increase active sites
by acid and alkaline etching;18 ozone surface
activation is more apt to be used for polymer substrates because of
the generation of the surface active groups by ozone oxidization.9 However, either of the two methods has an obvious
weakness of environment pollution.

Scheme 1 Molecular Structure of TPMMC (the
Active Ingredient of AEM5700),
and the Process of PCG
In this research, we used a glass fiber membrane to carry QAS molecules
(TPMMC) as a polycationic antibacterial agent, and the plasma bombardment
technique as a pretreatment to enhance the chemical grafting between
the glass fiber membrane and the QAS antibacterial agent. The glass
fiber membrane has many merits in the water purification domain than
other materials, such as excellent chemical and physical stability,
and low material cost. Compared with other QAS-grafting methods, this
plasma-enhanced chemical-grafting (PCG) technique is more environmentally
friendly, for example, no acid or alkaline usage, or no ozone releasing,
and more easy for operation. In addition, the PCG technique can be
used to activate both inorganic and polymer substrates, indicating
broader applications than other QAS-grafting methods. As far as we
know, it is the first time to use the PCG technique to improve antibacterial
performance of the glass fiber membrane. The antibacterial experiments
clearly showed that Escherichia coli had a lower survival rate by contacting to the membrane with plasma
bombardment pretreatment than that with contacting to the membrane
without plasma bombardment pretreatment. Therefore, this PCG technique
paves a novel way of chemically grafting QAS for surface modification
of a substrate to improve antibacterial performance, which can not
only be used in water treatment, but also expanded to a whole antibacterial
industry.

Results and Discussion
Scheme 1 shows a
brief process of PCG technique. The air plasma broke surface Si–O–Si
bonds of the glass fiber to form dangling silanol groups (Si–OH)
with moisture (the room relative humidity was around 60%), which was
a surface activation process of increasing active Si–OH for
chemically grafting QAS.9 The TPMMC was
hydrolyzed in an ethanol aqueous solution to form Si–OH at
30 °C for 4 h. The Si–OH groups in the TPMMC and dangling
on the glass fiber membrane were dehydrated and formed siloxane groups
(Si–O–Si), building up a linkage between the TPMMC and
the membrane.14,16 As shown in the Figure 1, the PM, plasma-bombarded
membrane (PBM), chemical grafting membrane (CGM), and PCGM demonstrated
fibrous structures with an axial dimension larger than 100 μm
and a radial dimension less than 5 μm. The pore formed between
the fibers was around 1–5 μm. This fibrous structure
was beneficial for bacteria filtration, which improved the contact
to the surface-anchored antibacterial agent. Both the PM and PBM in Figure 1a,b showed clear
fiber boundaries, which however, was indistinct on CGM and PCGM in Figure 1c,d. In Figure 1d, some fibers were
sticky to each other, as shown in the red-circled areas. The glue-like
areas was due to anchored TPMMC.

Figure 1 Morphologies of the PM (a), PBM (b), CGM
(c), and PCGM (d) under
SEM with a magnification of ×500.

Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was used to unravel thermal
durability and QAS content. The TGA plots of the four membranes were
shown in the Figure 2. From ambient temperatures to 150 °C, all the four samples
showed a weight loss about 2.5 wt %, which was attributed to the moisture
adsorbed on the fibers.14,16 An extra weight loss
of about 1.0% from 150 to 380 °C was likely because of the vaporization
of acrylic acid as a small molecule binder. Most of the weight loss
was occurred from 380 to 450 °C, which was a mixed process including
thermal decomposition of the binder and TPMMC, small molecules vaporization,
and so forth. Then, polymerization occurred mostly between 450 and
650 °C.16 In the end, the weight plots
of the samples became almost flat from 650 to 800 °C because
of the eventual mineralization. By comparison between the PM and PBM
without chemical grafting of TPMMC, it is clear that the plasma bombardment
led to a weight loss of 0.6 wt % (PM and PBM plots indicating sample
weights of 90.2 and 90.8 wt %, respectively, at 650 °C), which
resulted from plasma etching. While, the CGM and PCGM retained less
weights of 89.4 and 89.5 wt %, respectively, owning to the weight
loss of the surface-grafted antibacterial agent. Clearly, the weight
difference between the PM and CGM resulted from the antibacterial
agent, namely, the TPMMC grafted onto the PM was 0.8 wt %. Identically,
the TPMMC grafted onto the PBM was 1.3 wt %. The 0.5 wt % more TPMMC
grafted onto the PCGM than that onto the CGM was probably because
the plasma bombardment increased active dangling Si–OH groups
on the glass fiber to anchor more TPMMC by hydrolysis.

PBM, CGM, and PCGM from ambient temperatures
to 800 °C with a temperature ramping rate of 10 °C min–1.

The Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectra were shown in Figure 3 to analyze typical
functional groups of the membranes. Because all the four membranes
contained an acrylic acid binder, the C=O stretching peaks
were shown at 1727 cm–1 in the four FTIR plots.10,12,20 Identically, the glass fiber
substrate containing silicon oxides as the main ingredient, therefore,
two strong peaks at 458 and 1008 cm–1 were attributed
to Si–O–Si bending vibration and Si–O–Si
asymmetric vibration respectively.14 The
peaks at 2850 and 2920 cm–1 corresponded to the
C–H stretching, and the peaks at 1452 and 1490 cm–1 were related to the C–H bending.13,17 The C–H groups of PM and PBM were resulted from an acrylic
acid binder, while for the CGM and PCGM, the groups were resulted
from both the binder and the TPMMC. While, as grafted onto the glass
fiber, the TPMMC only existed in the samples of CGM and PCGM. Therefore,
only the two membranes demonstrated two fingerprint peaks of the C–N
deformation at 1564 and 1534 cm–1, respectively,
in the inset of Figure 3 with detailed plots from 1520 to 1580 cm–1.16−18

Figure 3 FTIR
spectra of the PM, PBM, CGM, and PCGM with detailed spectra
from wavenumber of 1580–1520 cm–1 in the
illustration.

The element composition and chemical
status of the nitrogen were
analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) in Figures 4 and 5. In Figure 4, all
the four materials contained Si 2s, Si 2p, O 1s, and C 1s peaks, indicating
silicon oxides and polymer binder in the substrate glass fibers. The
detailed scanning of N 1s was shown in Figure 5. Nitrogen was not contained in the PM because
of no chemical grafting of TPMMC or air plasma bombardment pretreatment.
With XPS peaks deconvolution, the N 1s peak of the PCGM was divided
into two peaks at 399.7 and 402.3 eV, which indicated two different
types of N status. The peak at 399.7 eV was due to interstitial N
doping into the glass fiber substrate without forming either N–O
or N–Si bonds.21 In the plasma bombardment,
the N in air was ionized and doped into the glass fiber, therefore,
both the PCGM and PBM with the air plasma bombardment showed interstitial
N 1s peaks resulting from the N dopant, which however, were not shown
in either CGM or PM. It should be noted that the interstitial N 1s
peak of the PCGM was slightly stronger than that of the PBM, which
might be probably because the TPMMC that was covered on the surface
of the PCGM partially, hindered some Al Kα characteristic X-ray
photons penetrating into the substrate to excite electrons in the
N 1s orbitals because the X-ray photons can only affect the surface
materials in a depth of about 2 nm. The peaks at around 402.3 eV only
existed in the PCGM and CGM, which was a typical N 1s peak position
of the QAS.9,11,13 Remarkably, the larger TPMMC N 1s peak area of the PCGM than that
of the CGM was because of more TPMMC grafted on the PCGM, which was
also proved in the TGA results.

with a binding energy
from 0 to 600 eV.

of XPS spectra of the PM, PBM, CGM, and
PCGM.

In Figure 6, the
surface zeta potentials of the PM, PBM, CGM, and PCGM in a pH range
from around 4–10 were obtained. Without chemical grafting of
TPMMC on the surface of the membrane, the zeta potentials (−50
to −60 mV) of the PM and PBM were similar to each other in
the test pH range. While grafted with TPMMC, the zeta potentials of
the membranes increased significantly, indicating that N+ of the TPMMC can increase surface positive charge. It distinctively
shows that the zeta potential of the PCGM was higher than that of
the CGM in the whole pH test range, for a typical example, the zeta
potential was 49.0 and 38.9 mV of the PCGM and CGM, respectively,
at pH = 7. The higher zeta potential was derived from larger TPMMC
molecules coverage of the PCGM than that of the CGM, which was consistent
with both the TGA and XPS results.

Figure 6 Zeta potential analyses of the PM, PBM,
CGM, and PCGM in various
solutions with different pHs.

Overall, according to the materials characterization data, it clearly
demonstrates that with plasma bombardment, the membrane can carry
more QAS molecules, leading to a higher positive charge density on
the surface, which can definitely strengthen Coulombic attraction
to the bacteria.

Figure 7 showed
survival rates of the E. coli with
contact to the membranes for 20 min. Without membranes in the solution,
the E. coli survival rate increased
up to 163.7% in 20 min, indicating a fast rate of reproduction. With
the PM and PBM in the solution, the mean survival rates of the E. coli were 127.0 and 121.9%, respectively. Although
the survival rate of the E. coli decreased
by comparison with the blank test, more E. coli were still existed in the solution after 20 min vibration than the
initial solutions, indicating neither of the membranes can inhibit E. coli reproduction. As shown in the scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) images, the membranes have a fibrous structure with
a pore size between fibers similar to the E. coli, therefore some E. coli might be
retained in the pores by the fibers to remain less E. coli in the solution. With TPMMC grafted on the
membranes, the mean survival rates of E. coli were decreased significantly to 11.3 and 4.1% for the CGM and PCGM,
respectively. The survival rates dropping obviously resulted from
antibacterial TPMMC. Moreover, with plasma bombardment as a pretreatment,
the PCGM showed a lower E. coli survival
rate than that the CGM did, which was attributed to more TPMMC grafted
onto the membrane. For one thing, more TPMMC can lead to a higher
positive charge density of the membrane to strengthen Coulombic attraction
to E. coli. For the other, more lipophilic
octadecyl groups were given to penetrate the E. coli cytomembrane, release the cytoplasmic inclusions and kill E. coli. In addition, it should be clarified that
the plasma bombardment was only a process for surface activation without
altering the fibrous structure which was also demonstrated in the
SEM images, therefore the improvement of the antibacterial performance
excluded the possibility of less E. coli remaining in the PCGM solution because of more E.
coli retained in the membrane than those of the CGM.
For a practical application, we measured the durability of antibacterial
performance of the PCGM in the Figure 8. Before the durability test, the membranes were already
rinsed several times by copious warm water in a Buchner funnel with
a wash-pump method. Consequently, the PCGM still showed stable E. coli survival rates of 4.1, 3.0, 5.5, and 3.7%
with water rinsing quantity from 0 to 3 L·cm–2 with 1 L·cm–2 as an interval. Therefore,
the stable survival rate indicated strong linkage of antibacterial
TPMMC onto the membrane which also indicated less antibacterial TPMMC
releasing and dissolving in the water to raise health concerns.

Figure 7 Antibacterial
performance of the PM, PBM, CGM and PCGM with a blank
culture solution with no membrane samples as a control test after
vibration. The mean values error bars of survival rates of the five
solution samples were also shown. The survival rate higher than 100%
means E. coli increasing during the
vibration test and no antibacterial property showing, while that lower
than 100% indicates effective antibacterial property.

water quantity.

Conclusions
In conclusion, chemical-grafting
method can anchor the QAS molecules
onto a glass fiber membrane, which was first enhanced by an easy-operation
and environmentally friendly plasma bombardment pretreatment. Although
the direct chemical-grafting method can also anchor antibacterial
QAS on the surface of the glass fiber membrane, the plasma bombardment
pretreatment as a surface activation technique can further enhance
the chemical-grafting process. Compared with the direct chemical-grafting
method, the PCG can anchor more QAS on the glass fiber membrane resulting
in a higher positive charge density on the membrane surface, which
is beneficial for both bacteria attraction and bacterial lysis. In
addition, the PCG membrane still demonstrated a durable antibacterial
performance after copious water rinsing. Therefore, the plasma bombardment
pretreatment for enhancement of QAS chemical-grafting provides a new
way to boost QAS antibacterial performance and facilitate practical
antibacterial application of the QAS in drinking water purification
industry.

Experimental Section
Materials Synthesis
The pristine
glass fiber membrane
(PM) was obtained from FeiBo Inc., Guangdong, China. The glass fiber
membrane contains silicon oxides as a main ingredient and a small
part of acrylic acid as a binder. As shown in the Scheme 1, the whole synthesis process
was divided into three main steps, antibacterial chemical preparation,
plasma bombardment pretreatment, and chemical grafting. The antibacterial
chemicals were prepared as four steps: first, AEM5700 (Microban Inc.,
Huntersville, NC, United States) with an effective ingredient of TPMMC
was mixed with tetraethyl orthosilicate (>99.0%, Aladdin Inc.,
Shanghai,
China) with a ratio of 1:3 as a homogenous solution A; second, the
ethanol (>99.5%, Aladdin Inc., Shanghai, China) was mixed with
deionized
(DI) water (18.2 mΩ·cm) with a ratio of 9:1 as a homogenous
solution B; third, 95 g of the solution B was mixed with 5 g of the
solution A in a beaker; fourth, the beaker was placed in a water bath
at 30 °C for 4 h for TPMMC hydrolysis.

Then, the plasma
bombardment pretreatment was conducted in a radio frequency (RF) plasma
setting (type model: CRF-APO-RP1020, CRF Inc. at Shenzhen, China)
with a power of 750 W and a frequency of 13.6 MHz. The compressed
and dried air with a flux of 2 L·s–1 was fed
for a plasma generator. The PM was plasma-bombarded for about 1 min
in the RF plasma setting. After plasma bombardment, the membrane was
named as the PBM. It should be mentioned that the PBM should be placed
in ambient conditions with a preferable relative humidity about 40–70%
(at this experiment, the relative humidity was about 60%) to form
dangling silanol groups (Si–OH) by reaction between the broken
Si–O bond and H2O molecule.

The PBM was saturated
in the prepared antibacterial liquid for
several minutes and then baked at 120 °C for 2 h in an oven for
reaction of chemical grafting. After the reaction, the membrane was
rinsed with copious warm DI water (50 °C) in a Buchner funnel
with a wash-pump method for several times to remove extra unlinked
TPMMC molecules and other organic monomers, and then dried at 120
°C for 0.5 h in an oven. The dried membrane was named as plasma
bombardment-enhanced CGM (PCGM). As a comparison, the PM directly
soaked in the antibacterial liquid without plasma bombardment was
named as CGM.

Materials Characterization
The morphologies
of the
membranes were obtained by a SEM (Hitachi SU8010) with a magnification
of ×500 and an electron acceleration voltage of 1.0 kV. To obtain
distinct images, Au was coated on the membrane samples to increase
electronic conductivity. The FTIR spectra (attenuated total reflection
mode) were obtained by a Thermal Nicolet is50 spectrometer (Thermo
Scientific, Waltham, MA) for vibration analysis of the chemical groups.
The chemical composition and status of the elements were analyzed
by a XPS (PHI 5000 Versa Probe System II, Physical Electronics, MN)
with Al Kα (1486.6 eV) as the X-ray source. The standard C 1s
peak at 284.8 eV was used as the reference to calibrate the binding
energies of all detailed elemental spectra of the XPS. The contents
and thermal stability of the materials were analyzed by a TGA (Mettler
TGA2, Mettler-Toledo, Switzerland) in a nitrogen atmosphere from ambient
temperatures to 800 °C with a temperature ramping rate of 10
°C·min–1. The surface zeta potential of
the membranes was measured at a pH range between 4 and 10 with a zeta
potential analyzer (SurPASS 3, Anton Paar, Austria).

Antibacterial
and Durability Tests
The antibacterial
tests included three main processes: reagents preparation, vibration
reaction, and germiculture. The reagent preparation can be divided
into four steps. First, 3.3 g of nutrient agar (Guangdong Huankai
Microbial Sci. & Tech. Co. Ltd., Guangzhou, China) was mixed with
100 mL of DI water as the germiculture media. Second, 0.03 M of phosphate
buffer saline (PBS) was prepared by blending 7.16 g of disodium hydrogen
phosphate dodecahydrate (>99.0%, AR, Na2HPO4·12H2O, Xilong Scientific Co., Guangdong, China)
and 1.36 g of potassium dihydrogen phosphate (>99.5%, AR, KH2PO4, Guangdong Chemical Reagent Engineering Technological
Research and Development Center, Guangdong, China). Third, E. coli (Guangdong Huankai Microbial Sci. & Tech.
Co. Ltd., Guangzhou, China) solution was prepared with a bacterial
concentration between 3 × 105 and 4 × 105 CFU·mL–1. Fourth, the PM, PBM, CGM,
and PCGM were cut into small pieces (each piece was about 5 ×
5 mm) and every 0.75 g of each membranes pieces were sampled for the
following tests. After sterilization of the membrane samples and containers,
four groups of 0.75 g of the membrane samples were placed into the
containers, each of which was added into 70 mL of the 0.03 M of PBS
solution. An extra container with PBS but no membrane samples was
prepared for a control test to obtain the E. coli reproduction performance. Each of the five containers was then added
with 5 mL of E. coli solution. After
gently shaking the containers for about 1 min to homogenize the solutions,
then 1 mL of each solution was sampled. The five containers were sealed
and placed in a vibration system (type: ZHWY-211C, Shanghai Zhicheng
Inc., Shanghai, China) for slightly swaying with a frequency of 120
rpm at 35 °C for 20 min. This vibration process was used to evaluate
the E. coli growth with and without
contact to the membranes. After vibration, the five E. coli solutions were sampled again. Thereafter,
total 10 samples (five before and the other five after vibration)
were individually diluted with PBS solution and cultured identically
in Petri dishes with nutrient agar for germiculture at 37 °C
for 48 h. After germiculture, the bacterial colony was numbered. Then,
the survival ratio of each sample can be calculated by the following
equation  

The PCGM was fixed in a homemade membrane
test mold for water flushing with a flow-through method for the durability
test. Namely, the membrane edges were sealed and water was flushed
through the membrane. Copious DI water was flushed through the PCGM
with a flux rate of 0.05 L·min–1·cm–2. The membrane samples flushed for 0, 20, 40, and
60 min, respectively, were used for the durability test to simulate
the membrane antibacterial activities in a long term usage. The E. coli survival ratio was obtained as the same way
in the above description.
