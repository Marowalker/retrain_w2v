In this work, we
explored the coordination properties of the geminal
phosphinoborane tBu2PCH2BPh2 (2) toward different gold(I) precursors. The
reaction of 2 with an equimolar amount of the sulfur-based
complex (Me2S)AuCl resulted in displacement of the SMe2 ligand and formation of linear phosphine gold(I) chloride 3. Using an excess of ligand 2, bisligated complex 4 was formed and showed dynamic behavior at room temperature.
Changing the gold(I) metal precursor to the phosphorus-based complex,
(Ph3P)AuCl impacted the coordination behavior of ligand 2. Namely, the reaction of ligand 2 with (Ph3P)AuCl led to the heterolytic cleavage of the gold–chloride
bond, which is favored over PPh3 ligand displacement. To
the best of our knowledge, 2 is the first example of
a P/B-ambiphilic ligand capable of cleaving the gold–chloride
bond. The coordination chemistry of 2 was further analyzed
by density functional theory calculations.

Introduction
Ambiphilic ligands
bearing a Lewis basic site for σ-donation
and a Lewis acidic site for σ-acceptation have been recognized
as ligands with unique coordination properties,1 resulting in unusual bonding situations (Z-type interactions)2,3 or halide abstraction from the metal precursor, which are both of
interest for catalytic applications.4,5 The coordination
behavior of ambiphilic ligands has been extensively studied in combination
with late transition metals, in particular, complexes with coinage
metals. Among these coinage metals, gold(I) is the most explored and
a plethora of gold complexes have been reported, which are mainly
dominated by ligands bearing a Lewis basic phosphine, in combination
with a variety of Lewis acidic sites based on boron,6,7 aluminum,8 gallium,9 indium,10 bismuth,11 silicon,12 tin,12a antimony,13 zirconium,14 and tellurium.15

In 2006, Bourissou and co-workers reported a bidentate phosphinoborane
ligand that reacts with (Me2S)AuCl to form complex A (Chart 1).6a In this example, the ambiphilic ligand reacts
with the metal precursor by the displacement of the dimethyl sulfide
ligand, resulting in the coordination of the phosphine to the gold(I)
center. Interestingly, the solid-state structure of A revealed a Au–B distance of 2.66 Å, which is well within
the sum of the van der Waals radii (∼3.9 Å), as well as
slight pyramidalization of the boron center (∑(CBC) = 355.8°),
indicating a Z-type interaction between the gold(I) center and the
Lewis acid. A year later, Bourissou and co-workers reported a tridentate
phosphinoborane ambiphilic ligand, which can react with the same metal
precursor also by the displacement of dimethyl sulfide to form complex B (Chart 1).6b The slightly distorted square planar coordination
geometry forces the boron center in a closer proximity to the gold
center (2.31 Å) compared to A, resulting in a stronger
pyramidalization (∑(CBC) = 341.2°), which suggests a stronger
boron–gold interaction. To complete this family of phosphinoborane
ligands with unique Z-type interactions, Bourissou and co-workers
reported a tetradentate phosphinoborane (TPB) ligand that forms complex C (Chart 1)
upon coordination to (Me2S)AuCl.6c Dissociation of the gold–chloride bond was easily achieved
by the addition of an external Lewis acid to C, giving
rise to cationic (TPB)Au+ species.6d

Chart 1 Ambiphilic Ligand Complexes of Gold(I) Chloride
Interestingly, tri- and tetradentate phosphine-based
ambiphilic
ligands with heavier main-group Lewis acidic sites based on aluminum,8c,8d gallium,9 indium,10 and silicon12c are reported
to facilitate heterolytic Au–Cl bond cleavage without an additional
halide abstracting agent. To date, phosphorus–aluminum ligand 1 is the only main-group-based bidentate ligand14 that has been reported to perform this bond
activation when reacted with tetrahydrothiophene gold(I) chloride
((THT)AuCl) forming zwitterionic complex D (Scheme 1),8a,8b which proved to be an active catalyst for the cyclization of propargylamides
in the absence of any additives. This demonstrates the potential of
ambiphilic ligands as an alternative to silver salts for the activation
of gold(I) precatalysts.16

Scheme 1 Reactivity
of 1 Toward Au(I) Precursors
Recently, we developed ambiphilic phosphinoborane 2 which exhibits frustrated Lewis pair reactivity17−19 when reacted
with, for example, H2, CO2, isocyanates, alkynes,
nitriles, and nitrilium triflates,20 but
can also act as an ambiphilic ligand forming a luminescent complex
upon coordination to Cu(I)Cl.21 The related
geminal P/Al-based FLP 1 and its capability to activate
a gold–chloride bond inspired us to explore the coordination
behavior of 2 toward gold(I) chloride complexes and also
to study the underlying factors experimentally and computationally.

Results
and Discussion
Reacting a solution of (Me2S)AuCl
in dichloromethane
(DCM) with 1 equiv of tBu2PCH2BPh2 (2) resulted in the formation of two
new species in solution, observed by 31P{1H}
NMR spectroscopy at δ = 75.3 (major, 75%) and 80.5 (minor, 25%)
and the formation of small amounts of insoluble purple solids (Scheme 2).a The X-ray diffraction analysis of colorless crystals obtained
by vapor diffusion of n-pentane into a DCM solution
confirmed the molecular structure of the major product 3, in which ligand 2 has displaced the SMe2 moiety, and in contrast to 1 (Scheme 1), did not cleave the gold–chloride
bond.b In the solid state, the P1–Au1–Cl1
bond angle is slightly bent (174.35(4)°)22 and the P1–C1–B1 bond angle (119.8(3)°) is comparable
to that of the optimized geometry20a of
the free ligand (2.1° increase). The B1–Au1 distance of
3.798(5) Å is just within the sum of the van der Waals radii
(∼3.9 Å), however, the planar geometry of the boron center
(∑(CB1C) = 359.8°) is rotated away from the gold center
(torsion angle P1–C1–B1–C8 = 46.4(5)°),
making any Z-type interaction unlikely. Interestingly, one of the
phenyl groups of the ligand is oriented in an almost parallel fashion
to the metal chloride bond,23 and the Au1–C8
and Au1–C9 bond distances of 3.326 Å indicate a possible
weak π-interaction, comparable to those previously reported
for Au(I) complexes bearing biarylphosphine ligands.24,25 The 11B{1H} NMR spectrum showed one signal
at 70.2 ppm, which is comparable to that of the free ligand (72.3
ppm)20 and is indicative for a planar diarylalkylborane,
supporting the absence of any Z-type interaction.

Scheme 2 Ligand Displacement
by Phosphinoborane 2
Analysis of compound 3 by density functional
theory
(DFT) calculations at the ωB97X-D/6-31G* (Def2-QZVP for Au)
level of theory26 revealed two possible
conformers which are close in energy (3 and 3′, Figure 1). Conformer 3 was found to be the global minimum and closely resembles
the geometry of 3 in the solid state as determined by
single-crystal X-ray crystallography (Figure 2). Interestingly, also a local minimum was
found, albeit higher in energy (3′, ΔΔE = 1.4 kcal/mol). 3′ revealed a significantly
more bent P1–C1–B1 backbone (106°) compared to 3 (119°), and the empty p orbital on boron is oriented
toward the gold center (torsion angle = 92.7°), analogous to
the reported complex A (Chart 1).6a The different
backbone of 3′ (C1 linker) compared
to the C2 bridge in A results in a larger
B1–Au1 distance (3.18 Å vs A: 2.663(8) Å),
which would lead to a much weaker Z-type interaction.

The minor product of the reaction was identified as a result
of
double addition of phosphinoborane 2 to (Me2S)AuCl and concomitant cleavage of the gold–chloride bond
forming bisligated zwitterionic complex 4 (Scheme 3), which compares well with
complex E that is obtained with P/Al analogue 1 (Scheme 1).8a Colorless crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction
were obtained by slow vapor diffusion of n-hexane
into a solution of 4 in tetrahydrofuran (THF). The molecular
structure of gold complex 4 (Figure 3) revealed a slightly bent P1–Au1–P2
bond angle (169.11(3)°) and remarkably similar P–C–B
bond angles (121.0(2)° and 120.9(2)°). The closest aryl–gold
distance is Au1–C7 (3.798(3) Å), suggesting the absence
of any π-interaction, and the B2–Au1 distance of 4.175(4)
Å reveals no Z-type interaction. The side product 4 can be synthesized and isolated in 82% yield by the reaction of
an excess (6 equiv) of ambiphilic ligand 2 with (Me2S)AuCl in DCM. The 31P{1H} NMR spectrum
of 4 revealed only one signal as a singlet at 80.5 ppm
at room temperature, which splits at −50 °C into two broad
singlets at 79.6 and 78.6 ppm. At −50 °C, still no signal
was observed in the 11B{1H} NMR spectrum, indicating
a fast exchange of the chloride atom between the Lewis acidic boron
sites.

Scheme 3 Formation of Bisligated Complex 4
Interestingly, the
ambiphilic P/B- and P/Al-based ligands 1 and 2 react differently with sulfur-based gold(I)
chlorides; therefore, we systematically evaluated all possible coordination
modes (I–IV; Scheme 4). In the first case, the sulfur-based ligand
is displaced by the ambiphilic ligand (I), which was
found for phosphinoborane 2 (Scheme 2), with the possibility of additional interaction
of the boron moiety of the ligand with the liberated sulfur ligand
(II). Another possibility is that the ambiphilic ligand
facilitates cleavage of the gold–chloride bond to afford compound III, which is unstable and can be stabilized at the cationic
gold(I) center by the sulfur-based ligand (IV), which
was reported for phosphinoalane 1 (Scheme 1).

Scheme 4 Computational Analysis of the Various
Coordination Modes of C1-Bridged Ligands
To gain more insights into the distinct reactivity
of ambiphilic
ligands 1 and 2, we resorted to DFT calculations
at the ωB97X-D/6-31G* (Def2-QZVP for Au) level of theory26 and investigated the influence of P substituents
(R = tBu, Mes) and Lewis acids (B, Al) on the reaction,
using a methylene linker as a common C1 bridge between
the Lewis acid and the base.c In accordance
with our experimental data, phosphinoborane 2 (R = tBu, E = B, Scheme 2) favors coordination mode I (ΔE = −32.1 kcal/mol). Additional interaction of the
complex with THT (mode II) is weak (ΔΔEI–II = −12.9 kcal/mol)
and entropically disfavored (ΔΔGI–II = 4.6 kcal/mol). Exchange
of the relatively strong Au–Cl bond for the weaker B–Cl
bond (mode III) is highly disfavored (ΔΔEI–III = 37.6 kcal/mol),
which could be compensated by Au–THT bond formation (mode IV, ΔΔEIII–IV = −45.8 kcal/mol), albeit this stabilization is insufficient
to account for the entropy effect (ΔΔGI–IV = 7.7 kcal/mol) and prevents
the formation of complex IV. Interestingly, changing
the Lewis acid from boron to aluminum had a large impact on the relative
stabilities (R = tBu, E = Al, Scheme 4). Cleavage of the Au–Cl bond becomes
less endothermic (ΔΔEI–III = 17.3 kcal/mol) because of the formation of a stronger Al–Cl
bond compared to the B–Cl bond (approx. 21 kcal/mol stronger).
Additional stabilization by THT makes coordination mode IV now the most favorable complex (ΔE = −68.1
kcal/mol; ΔG = −51.3 kcal/mol),d which explains the distinct difference in reactivity
between a P/B and P/Al ambiphilic ligand and is fully consistent with
the formation of complex 3 (Scheme 2) and D (Scheme 1). The influence of the P substituents is
in both cases very limited, resulting in the same trend for the mesityl-substituted
phosphinoborane (R = Mes, E = B) with a preference for coordination
mode I and phosphinoalane (R = Mes, E = Al) that prefers
heterolytic cleavage of the gold–chloride bond (IV).e These findings illustrate that for these
geminal Lewis acid/base pairs, the P substituent has a modest influence
on the preferred coordination mode, whereas the nature of the Lewis
acid is decisive and thus is an important design element for the development
of ambiphilic ligands for the coordination chemistry and catalysis.

To further explore the reactivity of phosphinoborane 2 toward gold(I) complexes, we also used (Ph3P)AuCl that
bears the stronger donating triphenylphosphine ligand. Slow addition
of a solution of 2 in DCM to a solution of (Ph3P)AuCl in DCM at 0 °C resulted in a clean conversion to a new
product 5 (Scheme 5). 31P{1H} NMR spectroscopy revealed
two doublets (AB system, 79.6 and 43.9 ppm, JP,P = 305 Hz), indicating that both ligand 2 and
triphenylphosphine are coordinated to the gold(I) metal center in
a linear fashion. The 11B{1H} NMR chemical shift
of 3.1 ppm is the characteristic for a quaternary boron center. Colorless
crystals suitable for the X-ray diffraction analysis were obtained
by layering a saturated solution of 5 in toluene with
pentane at room temperature (Figure 4). The molecular structure of 5 displays
that both triphenylphosphine and phosphinoborane 2 are
coordinated to gold in an almost linear fashion (P–Au–P
173.71(3)°). Remarkably, the chloride atom is transferred to
the borane moiety of the ligand and, with a Au–Cl distance
of 3.2386(8) Å, any Au–Cl interaction is excluded. Pyramidalization
around the boron center (∑(CBC) = 336°) because of the
formation of a chloroborate is in accordance with the strong upfield 11B NMR chemical shift. To the best of our knowledge, 2 is the first example of a bidentate phosphinoborane ambiphilic
ligand to cleave a gold–chloride bond.

Scheme 5 Gold–Chloride Cleavage by Phosphinoborane 2
To verify the role
of the Lewis acid in the gold–chloride
bond cleavage, we resorted to DFT calculations at the ωB97X-D/6-31G*
(Def2-QZVP for Au) level of theory.26 These
calculations showed that ligation of phosphinoborane 2 to (Ph3P)AuCl initially affords the neutral Y-shaped
complex 6 (Figure 5), a geometry which could not be located on the potential
energy surface when using (THT)AuCl.27,28 Subsequently,
the pendent borane of intermediate 6 is able to abstract
the chloride from the gold center to form product 5 (ΔE = −35.2 kcal/mol, ΔG = −18.5
kcal/mol), which is favored over the formation of the linear Au(I)Cl
complex 3 (ΔE = −9.12 kcal/mol,
ΔG = −9.17 kcal/mol) by dissociation
of PPh3 from intermediate 6.

energy) profile calculated for the gold–chloride
bond cleavage by phosphinoborane 2. The relative energies
are given in kcal/mol.

The distinct difference in reactivity of 2 with
(Me2S)AuCl and (Ph3P)AuCl, forming 3 and 5, respectively, can be directly related to the
difference
in bond strength of the Au–Cl and B–Cl bond and to the
stabilization by the coligand (SMe2 or PPh3)
of the different coordination modes (Scheme 4). When ligand 2 is reacted
with (Me2S)AuCl, the SMe2 coligand does not
bind strongly enough to gold to compensate the formation of the weak
B–Cl bond and to facilitate the Au–Cl bond cleavage,
and therefore 2 only displaces the weakly bound sulfur
ligand. In contrast, when 2 is reacted with (Ph3P)AuCl, the triphenylphosphine coligand is more strongly bound to
gold (approximately 18 kcal/mol stronger compared to THT) and is thereby
able to compensate for the formation of the weaker B–Cl, leading
to the cleavage of the Au–Cl bond, which emphasizes the diverse
reactivity of 2 as ambiphilic ligand.

Conclusions
Linear phosphine gold(I) chloride complex 3 can be
obtained by the reaction of ambiphilic ligand 2 with
(Me2S)AuCl. The side product of this reaction was identified
as bisligated complex 4 and can be isolated by reacting
an excess of ligand 2 with (Me2S)AuCl. The
distinct difference in reactivity between the geminal P/Al-based ligand 1 and its P/B-analogue 2 toward sulfur-based
gold(I) precursors was studied by DFT calculations, which revealed
that the nature of the Lewis acid determines the preference for ligand
displacement versus gold–chloride abstraction. Changing (Me2S)AuCl for triphenylphosphine gold chloride drastically changed
the outcome of the reaction with ambiphilic ligand 2,
which forms complex 5 by the cleavage of the gold–chloride
bond, instead of the displacement of PPh3. To the best
of our knowledge, the geminal phosphinoborane 2 is the
first example of a P/B-ambiphilic ligand that is capable of cleaving
a gold–chloride bond.

All manipulations
were carried out under an atmosphere of dry nitrogen, using standard
Schlenk and drybox techniques, and were performed in the dark as a

This work was supported by the Council for Chemical
Sciences of The Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO/CW)
by a VIDI grant (J.C.S.) and benefitted from interactions within the
COST Action CM1205 CARISMA (Catalytic Routines for Small Molecule
Activation).

a Same reactivity was observed when
(THT)AuCl was used as gold(I) metal precursor. However, the selectivity
was lower compared to (Me2S)AuCl and the formation of several
unidentified products was observed by 31P{1H}
NMR spectroscopy, therefore (Me2S)AuCl was solely used
as sulfur-based metal precursor.

b Compound 3 is unstable
in solution over time. A solution of 3 in DCM slowly
degrades at room temperature into unidentifiable products observed
by 31P{1H} NMR spectroscopy, as well as insoluble
purple solids.

c We used (THT)AuCl
as a metal precursor
for our computational study because the reactivity of phosphinoalane 1 with (THT)AuCl was already well-described, and ligand 2 reacts with (THT)AuCl and (Me2S)AuCl in a similar
fashion.

d This observation
compares well with
the findings of Bourissou and co-workers for tridentate ambiphilic
ligands, see ref (8c).

computational analysis including the effect of the phosphorus substituents,
