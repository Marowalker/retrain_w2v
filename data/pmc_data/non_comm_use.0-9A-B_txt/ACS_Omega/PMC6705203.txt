Organic–inorganic
perovskites are composed of organic cations
and [PbX6]4– octahedra, and the properties
change depending on the type of organic cations. To identify the effect
of organic cations and control the properties of the perovskite, thin
films were prepared using quaternary alkylammonium and quaternary
alkylphosphonium cations, which have big steric effects. A big steric
effect can generate the distortion of [PbX6]4– octahedra leading to changes in properties. A thin film of a Pb-based
organic–inorganic perovskite having quaternary alkylphosphonium
cations was prepared for the first time. An exciton absorption was
observed at a lower wavelength than other perovskites prepared from
primary and quaternary ammonium salts. The perovskite with phosphonium
groups was thermally stable compared with ammonium groups.

1 Introduction
Organic–inorganic
metal halide-based perovskite-type compounds
are artificially synthesizable hybrid materials. By dissolving stoichiometric
amounts of an organic ammonium halide and lead halide in suitable
solvents, these microcrystalline and crystalline perovskite compounds
can be easily obtained because of their high self-organizational properties.
Compounds composed of methylamine and lead iodide are rapidly gaining
attention worldwide as next-generation solar cell materials because
their initial application in photovoltaic devices by Miyasaka et al.
in 2009.1 As the study of perovskite solar
cells (PSCs) has progressed dramatically over the last decade, the
power conversion efficiency of PSCs has increased from 3.8% to more
than 22%.2−11 Although the perovskite-type materials used for photovoltaic solar
cells have been limited thus far to three-dimensional (3D) perovskites
with the general formula AMX3 (A = Cs+, CH3NH3+, and CH(NH2)2+; M = Pb2+ and Sn2+; X = Cl–, Br–, and I–),
organic–inorganic perovskites are a relatively large family,
thanks to various combinations of organic and inorganic components.
For example, two-dimensional (2D) perovskites with the general formula
A2MX4 (A = CH3(CH2)nNH3+ and C6H5(CH2)nNH3+; M = Pb2+ and Sn2+; X =
Cl–, Br–, and I–) can be prepared from reacting alkylammonium salts with longer chain
lengths than ethyl. 2D perovskites form quantum-well structures, in
which inorganic layers and organic ammonium layers are alternately
stacked. The inorganic layers comprise 2D sheets of [MX6]4– octahedra connected at four corners with halide
ions in the plane. Accordingly, excitons are confined strongly in
the inorganic layers. These compounds exhibit outstanding optical
properties such as strong photoluminescence (PL) and high optical
nonlinearity.12−18 Furthermore, intermediate dimensional perovskites (2D–3D)
and lower dimensional perovskites (1D, 0D) can be obtained by using
various kinds of organic amines.19−21 Nevertheless, most perovskites
are fabricated from primary ammonium cations. Research of perovskite
compounds with quaternary cations especially for phosphonium groups
has not been progressed much.22,23 Most of the articles
on quaternary ammonium or phosphonium hybrids preferentially evaluated
electrical properties of these hybrids having different metals from
Pb, and thus the effects of bulky ammonium or phosphonium cations
on other properties are still unclear. The three methyl groups around
an ammonium ion generate a steric effect and affect the organic–inorganic
interface, such that the changes in optical properties can be expected.
Additionally, the ionic radius of phosphorus is larger than that of
nitrogen, thus creating a larger steric effect. In this study, we
introduced primary ammonium, quaternary ammonium, and phosphonium
groups into the organic layer of perovskites to examine the steric
effects of these organic cations on the physical properties of perovskites
(Figure 1).

used in this study.

2 Results
and Discussion
Quaternary ammonium bromide, C6H13N(CH3)3Br (C6TNBr), or quaternary phosphonium
bromide, C6H13P(CH3)3Br
(C6TPBr), were mixed
with a stoichiometric
amount of PbBr2 in N,N-dimethylformamide to make perovskite precursor solutions. Films
of C6TN–PbBr and C6TP–PbBr were fabricated by spin-coating. As a comparison, a (C6H13NH3)2PbBr4 (C6N–PbBr) spin-coated
film was also fabricated by a similar procedure using primary ammonium
hydrobromide, C6H13NH3Br (C6NBr). Figure 2a,b show the out-of-plane X-ray diffraction
(XRD) profiles of the C6N–PbBr, C6TN–PbBr, and C6TP–PbBr films. C6TN–PbBr and C6TP–PbBr films showed different peaks from
their precursors C6TNBr, C6TPBr, and PbBr2, suggesting that new structures were formed by complexation.
A series of diffraction peaks corresponding to the interlayer d-spacing between the inorganic layers was observed for
the C6TN–PbBr and C6N–PbBr films. From the diffraction peaks observed at 4.8° and 4.0°
for C6N–PbBr and C6TN–PbBr, the d-spacing values were calculated to be 18.3
and 22.2 Å, respectively. Thus, by introducing the quaternary
ammonium cation, the d-spacing increased by about
4 Å. The additional three methyl groups at the ammonium center
produced a greater steric effect than a primary ammonium group. On
the other hand, many peaks were observed for the C6TP–PbBr film. C6TP–PbBr generated a
peak at 5.5° and the d-spacing value was 16.1
Å. Because the ionic radius of phosphorus is larger than that
of nitrogen, the d-spacing value was expected to
increase, but it was actually the reverse. This result suggested that
the alkyl moieties of C6TP–PbBr are greatly tilted or strongly packed between
the inorganic layers.

XRD
profiles of films: (c) C6N–PbBr and C6TN–PbBr, and (d) C6TP–PbBr.

Figure 2c,d show
the in-plane XRD profiles of the C6N–PbBr, C6TN–PbBr, and C6TP–PbBr films. C6N–PbBr showed a diffraction peak
at 15.3° (5.8 Å), which corresponds to the size of a [PbBr6]4– octahedra. Thus, the octahedra in this
compound shared corners with one another to form an inorganic sheet
parallel to the substrate. For C6TN–PbBr with quaternary cations, the 15.3°
diffraction peak disappeared, and a new peak was observed at 11.6°
(7.6 Å). For C6TP–PbBr, a peak at 9.6° (9.2 Å) was observed at a smaller angle.
The d-spacing values are larger than that of ordinary
corner-sharing perovskites, suggesting that the introduction of quaternary
cations causes a change in the connectivity of [PbBr6]4– octahedra. It was predicted that the cation portion,
with its large steric effect tilted, the octahedra such that the cations
could fit between them when forming the perovskite structure. In addition,
the perovskites with quaternary cations produced diffraction peaks
at 3.9° and 5.9° for C6TN–PbBr and at a smaller angle (3.8°) for C6TP–PbBr, indicating
that crystalline growth was partially perpendicular to the substrates. C6TN–PbBr was
expected to form a layered structure because a series of diffraction
peaks was observed. However, a pure layered structure did not appear
to be formed, which would have a molar ratio of C6TNBr and PbBr2 of 2:1
with a theoretical elemental analysis of C, 26.51; H, 5.44; N, 3.44.
Instead, the actual value was significantly different at C, 21.30;
H, 4.28; N, 2.75. This result suggests that the molar ratio of C6TNBr and PbBr2 is 1.33:1 (calcd C, 21.64; H, 4.44; N, 2.80). An ordinary layered
perovskite has a structure in which organic cations are contained
between [PbBr6]4– octahedra constituting
the inorganic layer. However, because quaternary ammonium has a large
steric effect, not all quaternary ammonium cations can fit between
the [PbBr6]4– octahedra. Thus, it is
considered that the steric effects induce the formation of a structure
in which the organic cations are partially extruded or other connection
of [PbBr6]4– octahedra. When ammonium
cations are close to each other in the perovskite structure, van der
Waals forces act between adjacent cations to maintain the layered
structure. On the other hand, C6TP–PbBr has a structure different from C6TN–PbBr. There
are many cations that cannot fit between the [PbBr6]4– octahedra due to the large steric effect.

Figure 3a shows
the UV–vis absorption spectra of C6N–PbBr, C6TN–PbBr, and C6TP–PbBr films. Absorption peaks attributed
to quantum confinement structures were observed for each film, suggesting
the formation of excitons in the perovskites. There are only a few
reports of a phosphonium-based perovskite compound. It is notable
that exciton absorption was also observed for C6TP–PbBr to which alkylphosphonium
groups were introduced.24 As the steric
effect of the cation portion increased, the exciton absorption peak
shifted to shorter wavelengths, indicating that the quantum confinement
structure was changed by introducing various cations with different
steric effects. These peak shifts are attributed to the distortion
of the [PbBr6]4– octahedra due to the
increase in the steric effect of the cation portion. As the distortion
of the [PbBr6]4– octahedra becomes energetically
unstable, an exciton absorption peak shift to the higher energy side,
namely the lower wavelength side, is observed. Figure 3b shows the PL spectra of C6N–PbBr, C6TN–PbBr, and C6TP–PbBr films. Emission
peaks corresponding to exciton absorption were observed for C6N–PbBr and C6TN–PbBr.

Figure 3 (a) UV–vis
absorption spectra and (b) PL spectra of C6N–PbBr, C6TN–PbBr, and C6TP–PbBr films.

A Stokes shift was about 16 nm for C6N–PbBr and 21 nm for C6TN–PbBr. The peak intensity
of C6TN–PbBr was lower than that of C6N–PbBr. On the other hand, C6TP–PbBr generated a broad emission
peak unlike the other two hybrids. This dramatic change is due to
structural distortions of the inorganic lattice.25

Figure 4 shows the
thermogravimetric (TG) curves of C6TN–PbBr and C6TP–PbBr microcrystals. The perovskite with
alkylphosphonium groups possessed higher thermal stability. The thermal
decomposition point of C6TP–PbBr significantly increased compared to C6TN–PbBr, 399 °C
for C6TP–PbBr, and 279 °C for C6TN–PbBr. In general, hydrogen bonds act between ammonium
cations (N+) and halogen anions (Cl–,
Br–, and I–) in the perovskite
structure. In the case of the perovskite with phosphonium cations,
hydrogen bonds also act between phosphonium cations and bromine anions.
Thus, the higher thermal stability of C6TP–PbBr is attributed to the stronger hydrogen
bonds between phosphonium cations and bromine anions compared to those
between ammonium cations and bromine anions.

Figure 4 TG curves of C6TN–PbBr and C6TP–PbBr.

When C6TPBr was
introduced to the perovskite, multiple structures were formed instead
of a single-layered structure. In order to examine the additive effect
of C6TPBr to conventional
2D perovskites, we prepared perovskite films, (C6N)2n(C6TP)2(1–n)–PbBr (n = 0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.0), by mixing C6NBr with C6TPBr. Figure 5a,b show out-of-plane XRD profiles and UV–vis
absorption spectra of the (C6N)2n(C6TP)2(1–n)–PbBr (n = 0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.0) films. For n =
1.0, a series of diffraction peaks was observed, indicating that the
compound formed a layered structure. For n = 0.50
and 0.75, in addition to an original diffraction of 2D at 4.8°,
diffraction peaks at 3.9° were observed. The peak intensity at
3.9° increased as n increased. For n = 0.25, the peak at 4.8° was completely disappeared and only
a simple diffraction pattern at 3.9° was observed. Additionally,
this film generated higher order diffraction peaks and had high crystallinity.
This peak is consistent with the peak observed for in-plane diffraction
patterns of pure C6TP–PbBr which was shown in Figure 2d. This indicates that by mixing C6NBr with C6TPBr, the orientation of the layered structure
was dramatically changed. Optical absorption properties also support
this results. As shown in Figure 5b, only a single absorption peak was observed for each
sample. The wavelength of the exciton absorption peak was dramatically
changed between n = 1.0–0. The exciton absorption
peak was observed around 400 nm for n = 0.50, 0.75,
and 1.0, suggesting that these electronic states were affected by C6N–PbBr. The
small shift about 10 nm observed for n = 0.50 and
0.75 compared with n = 1.0. This implies that the
energy loss was a structural perturbation. On the other hand, the
exciton absorption peak was observed around 320 nm for n = 0.25 and 0, suggesting that these electronic states were dominated
by C6TP–PbBr. This is well consistent with the results of XRD patterns shown
in Figure 5a. From
the out-of-plane XRD results shown above, the diffraction intensity
at 4.8° is stronger than that of 3.9° for n = 0.50 and 0.75, therefore, the optical properties were mainly dominated
by the conventional 2D compound, C6N–PbBr. For n = 0.25,
the XRD profile shows a strong diffraction at 3.9°, so the electric
state of C6TP–PbBr was dominated. These results showed that the structural orientation
and electronic state of perovskite compounds can be controlled by
mixing primary and quaternary cations.

spectra of (C6N)2n(C6TP)2(1–n)–PbBr (n = 0,

3 Conclusions
Perovskite films were prepared from quaternary
long alkylphosphonium
cations for the first time. Perovskite compounds can be prepared not
only by the ammonium type, but also by the phosphonium type cations.
Introducing quaternary cations into the perovskite structure shifted
the absorption peaks to shorter wavelengths upon increasing the steric
effect of the cation portion. The phosphonium-based perovskites possessed
higher thermal stability due to the strong hydrogen bonds between
phosphonium cations and bromine anions. Furthermore, the structural
orientation and electronic state of perovskite compounds can be controlled
by mixing primary and quaternary cations.

4.2 Sample
Preparation
C6H13P(CH3)3Br and PbBr2 were
dissolved in DMF at 50 °C for 1 h to obtain the precursor solutions
for the preparation of C6TP–PbBr. Similarly, precursor
solutions of C6TN–PbBr and C6N–PbBr
were prepared. Films were fabricated on preheated hydrophilic substrates
by spin-coating at 2000 rpm using a MIKASA 1H-D7 SPINCOATER. The substrates
were heated at ca. 100 °C during the spin-coating process to
obtain high-quality films because of the high boiling point of DMF.
As a comparison, the (C6H13NH3)2PbBr4 (C6N–PbBr) spin-coated film was also fabricated by a similar
procedure using primary ammonium hydrobromide, C6H13NH3Br (C6NBr).

(C6N)2n(C6TP)2(1–n)–PbBr (n = 0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.0) films were also fabricated by a
similar procedure. The precursor solution was prepared by mixing C6NBr and C6TPBr in any ratio. The following
microcrystalline powder are for the thermal analysis. A microcrystalline
powder of C6TN–PbBr was obtained by pouring the
precursor solution into acetone. After vacuum drying, a white powder
was obtained. The microcrystalline powder of C6TP–PbBr
was obtained by drying the precursor solution, and a white powder
was obtained.
