Triphenylamine–benzothiazole
derivatives, N-(4-(benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)phenyl)-N-phenylbenzenamine (1), N-(4-(benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)-3-methoxyphenyl)-N-phenylbenzenamine
(2), and 2-(benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)-5-(diphenylamino)phenol
(3), showed unusual temperature-controlled locally excited
(LE) and twisted intramolecular charge-transfer (TICT) state fluorescence
switching in polar solvents. The detailed photophysical studies (absorption,
fluorescence, lifetime, and quantum yield) in various solvents confirmed
polarity-dependent LE and TICT state formation and fluorescence tuning. 1 and 2 exhibited strong fluorescence with short
lifetime in nonpolar solvents compared to polar solvents. 1, 2, and 3 in dimethylformamide (DMF) at
room temperature showed low-energy weak TICT state fluorescence, whereas
high-energy strong LE state fluorescence was observed at −196
°C. Interestingly, further increasing the temperature from 20
to 100 °C, the DMF solution of 1 and 2 exhibited rare fluorescence enhancement with a slight blue shift
of λmax via activating more vibrational bands of
the TICT state. Thus, 1 and 2 showed weak
TICT state fluorescence at room temperature, strong LE state fluorescence
at −196 °C, and activation of TICT state at 100 °C.
Moreover, molecular conformation and aggregation in the solid state
influenced strongly on the fluorescence properties of 1, 2, and 3. Solid-state fluorescence and
pH-responsive imidazole nitrogen have been exploited for demonstrating
halochromism-induced fluorescence switching. Computational studies
provided further insights into the fluorescence tuning and switching.
The present studies provide understanding and opportunity to make
use of D–A organic molecules in the LE and TICT states for
achieving fluorescence switching and tuning.

1 Introduction
Fluorescence
switching and tuning of organic molecules received
significant attention over the years because of their fundamental
importance and application potentials in modern optical and optoelectronic
devices.1−4 Fluorescence phenomena that involve electron transfer, energy transfer,
excimer formation, and J or H aggregation have been strongly influenced
by fluorophore orientation, conformation, and flexibility. The nonplanar
molecular conformation of triphenylamine (TPA) and tetraphenyl ethylene
core has been used to generate aggregation-enhanced emissive (AEE)
and stimuli-responsive fluorescent materials.5−7 Conformational
flexibility of fluorophores produced polymorphism-induced fluorescence
switching and tuning.8−10 Donor–acceptor (D–A) organic molecules
display locally excited (LE) and twisted intramolecular charge-transfer
(TICT) state fluorescence depending on the solvent polarity and viscosity
that drastically modulated the fluorescence λmax and
efficiency.11,12 Interestingly, the LE and TICT
character of D–A molecules can easily be controlled using several
factors including steric substituents, conformation, D–A strength,
and polarity environments that make the D–A fluorophores highly
attractive toward various applications.13−15 Boron–dipyrromethene-based
compounds exhibited transition from nonpolarized fluorescent LE state
to nonfluorescent highly polarized TICT state depending on the solvent
polarity, which has been used as an environmental polarity sensor.16,17 Steric restrictions in D–A molecules enabled precise control
of the proportion of the LE and TICT state and are used for developing
solvatochromic probes and AEE materials.18−20

Particularly,
TICT-active fluorophores with weak supramolecular
interacting functionality that rigidifies the fluorophores and restricts
the intramolecular motions are ideal molecules for generating AEE
materials with exciting fluorescence properties.21−23 D–A
molecules with hybridized LE- and TICT-based charge-transfer (CT)
state were recently proposed for developing efficient electroluminescent
and organic light-emitting diode materials.24−26 The enhancement
of TICT-active fluorophore by hampering LE–TICT interconversion
in viscous media has been utilized to study the peptide–protein
interaction and imaging intracellular microviscosity.27,28 Although rarely reported, some of the TICT-active fluorophores showed
enhancement of fluorescence with increasing temperature via activating
more vibrational bands.29−32 Alkyl-substituted organoboronium bisdiketone showed
dramatic fluorescence thermochromism.33 A ratiometric fluorescence thermometer with a positive temperature
coefficient has been demonstrated using N,N-dimethyl-4-((2-methylquinolin-6-yl)ethynyl)aniline, a
TICT-active molecule.32 Thus, the LE and
TICT character of D–A molecules have been exploited to tune
the fluorescence and to increase the external quantum efficiency for
organic light-emitting diodes. However, utilization of the LE and
TICT character of D–A molecules for fluorescence switching
in solution by controlling the temperature has been scarcely reported.

TPA, a nonplanar propeller-shaped molecule, has been used as the
core unit to generate several AEE and stimuli-responsive smart fluorescent
materials including rewritable and self-erasable fluorescent materials.34−37 Benzothiazole, a heterocyclic aromatic ring with electron-deficient
sulfur atom, has often been employed to improve the D–A character
and fluorescence intensity of organic molecules.38,39 The integrating benzothiazole with TPA produced electroluminescent,
solvatochromic, and fluorescence sensing molecules.40−44 Benzothiazole has also extensively explored for generating
solid-state fluorescent materials based on excited-state intramolecular
proton-transfer mechanism.45 We are interested
in developing smart fluorescent materials that respond to various
external stimuli including temperature, pressure, solvent, and pH.46,47 Hence, we envisage that integrating mechanochromic TPA with pH-responsive
benzothiazole might produce multi-stimuli-responsive fluorescent materials,
especially halochromism-induced rewritable and self-erasable fluorescent
platforms. In this manuscript, we report the synthesis of TPA–benzothiazole
derivatives, N-(4-(benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)phenyl)-N-phenylbenzenamine (1), N-(4-(benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)-3-methoxyphenyl)-N-phenylbenzenamine (2), and 2-(benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)-5-(diphenylamino)phenol (3),
and unusual temperature-controlled LE and TICT state fluorescence
switching in dimethylformamide (DMF). Absorption and fluorescence
spectra of all three compounds revealed solvent polarity-dependent
LE and TICT character. 1 and 2 exhibited
strong fluorescence in nonpolar solvents compared to polar solvents. 3 exhibited relatively weak fluorescence in solution because
of a labile phenolic hydroxyl functional group. 1, 2, and 3 showed TICT, LE, and rare TICT-activated
state emission in DMF depending on the temperature. Solid-state structural
studies were performed to establish the role of molecular conformation
and organization on solid-state fluorescence.

2 Results
and Discussion
1, 2, and 3 molecules (Scheme 1) were synthesized
from the corresponding aldehyde as described in Scheme S1.41,42 The absorption spectra of 1, 2, and 3 in various solvents
did not show significant modulation of peak position. The intramolecular
CT band between electron-rich TPA and electron-deficient benzothiazole
appeared between 370 and 374 nm for 1, whereas 2 revealed absorption between 372 and 378 nm (Figure S7a,b). 3 showed λmax between 381 and 391 nm in different solvents (Figure S7c). The slight red shift of absorption
peak in 2 and 3 could be attributed to methoxy
and hydroxyl donor groups. The similar absorption wavelength at different
solvent polarity indicates that all compounds showed only slight change
of dipole in the ground state. In contrast, the fluorescence spectra
of 1, 2, and 3 exhibited typical
solvent polarity-dependent bathochromism. 1 showed a
fluorescence shift from 434 nm in toluene to 501 nm in CH3CN (Figure 1a). The
fluorescence of 2 and 3 red-shifted from
422 nm in toluene to 480 nm in CH3CN and 438 in toluene
to 503 nm in CH3CN, respectively (Figures 1b
and S8). This indicates that the excited
states of the molecules might be significantly polar to be affected
by the solvent polarity. The excited-state dipole moments (μe) of 1 and 2 were calculated from
the slope of the Stokes shift (νa–νf) using the Lippert-Mataga equation, which was drawn against
the orientation of polarizability (f). The plot of
Stokes shift against solvent polarizability shows clearly two linear
regions that indicate two distinct excited states for low and high
polarity (Figure 1c,d).
The calculated ground state is 3.37 and 6.33 D, respectively. Accordingly,
the excited-state dipole (μe) values in toluene and
DMF are calculated to be 8.8 and 12.42 D (1) and 10.28
and 13.38 D (2) that could be attributed to the LE and
TICT state, respectively.49,50 The slight absorption
λmax changes and large bathochromic fluorescence
in different solvent polarity suggest the formation of TICT state
in polar solvents.11,32 In nonpolar solvents, the dipole
(μg) of 1 and 2 in toluene
is 2.94 and 5.58 D and DMF shows stronger quantum yield (Φf) compared to polar solvents (Table 1). The strong fluorescence with blue-shifted
emission in nonpolar solvents is attributed to high-energy LE state,
whereas comparatively weak and red-shifted emission from polar solvent
is attributed to TICT state (Scheme 2). In nonpolar solvents, the D–A fluorophore
adopts coplanar conformation, which was stabilized via the mesomeric
interaction between the π-orbitals of D and A units. In contrast,
D–A fluorophores undergo fast intramolecular CT accompanied
by an intramolecular D–A-twisted structure around the single
bond in polar solvents and produces a relaxed perpendicular structure
(Scheme 2).11 The nonradiative relaxation of D–A from
TICT state often leads to weak or nonfluorescence in polar solvents.
The excited-state lifetime measurements of 1 and 2 across different solvent polarity revealed single exponential
decay with the increase of lifetime with solvent polarity (Table 2, Figure S9). This also further supports the formation of TICT
state in polar solvents.11,513 fluorophore
showed weak fluorescence in all solvents, which might be due to the
presence of acidic hydroxyl functionality.

1 showed LE state fluorescence at 432 nm in toluene,
whereas low-energy TICT state fluorescence at 501 nm in DMF solution
(Figure 1a). 2, 3 showed fluorescence at 422 and 438 nm in
toluene and 470 and 467 nm in DMF, respectively. CH3CN,
CH3OH, and ethanol solutions of 1 and 2 also showed fluorescence λmax similar to
DMF. Interestingly, all three compounds exhibited strong blue-shifted
emission with drastic enhancement of intensity upon cooling DMF solution
at −196 °C (Figures 2, S10, and S11). The fluorescence
of 1 was blue-shifted from 501 to 447 nm with 2 times
enhancement of intensity compared to room temperature. Fifteen and
three times enhancement of fluorescence intensity was observed for 2 and 3, respectively, compared to room temperature. 2 showed a blue shift of fluorescence from 470 to 438 nm and 3 fluorescence was blue-shifted from 467 to 444 nm at −196
°C. The blue-shifted fluorescence at −196 °C could
be attributed to the freezing of DMF solution that might hinder conversion
of coplanar planar LE state to twisted molecular conformation of TICT
state. The normal TICT state fluorescence with reduced intensity was
observed by increasing the temperature to −6 °C (Figures 2a,b and S10). The intensity was further reduced with
a slight blue shifting λmax by increasing to room
temperature. In solution, coplanar LE state can easily be converted
to twisted TICT state in polar medium. Thus, reversible LE and TICT
states at different temperatures lead to reversible fluorescence switching
without significant change of intensity.

at λmax of (a,c) 1 and (b,d) 2 in DMF (10–5 M). The intensity of peak at −196
°C has been divided by a factor of (a) 2 and (b) 15.

It is noted that the fluorescence λmax at −196
°C in DMF as well as in toluene solution is nearly the same for 1 and 3. The blue-shifted LE state fluorescence
at −196 °C has also been observed in other polar solvents
such as CH3CN, CH3OH, and ethanol (Figure S12); however, DMF was chosen to investigate
heat-dependent fluorescence switching in view of its higher boiling
point. TICT formation in DMF prompted to explore rare TICT-induced
fluorescence enhancement with increasing temperature.52,53 Both 1 and 2 did not show significant
change in the intensity and λmax between 10 and 30
°C. However, further increase of temperature exhibited gradual
enhancement of fluorescence intensity with a blue shift of λmax [501–480 nm (1), 475–460 nm
(2)]. Upon cooling to room temperature, the fluorescence
reverts to 501 nm for 1 and 470 nm for 2. Heating- and cooling-induced reversible fluorescence switching
was observed for several cycles without significant change of intensity
or peak position. Both 1 and 2 exhibited
similar fluorescence in the forward and reverse direction at 30 °C
(Figure S13). Excitation spectra of 1, 2, and 3 at different temperatures
also showed a clear change of peak position (Figure S14). At −196 °C temperature, the TICT band around
400 nm for all three compounds completely disappeared. The peak position
has been slightly blue-shifted at 100 °C compared to room temperature
(Figure S14a,b). The weak peaks at −196
°C might be due to aggregation of molecules at freezing temperature.
In contrast, 3 that showed reduction of fluorescence
intensity with increasing temperature showed a red shift of peak position
(Figure S14c). The enhancement of fluorescence
intensity with temperature could be attributed to the activation of
more vibration bands that leads to stronger TICT fluorescence.32,33 The TICT state often shows weak red-shifted fluorescence because
fluorescence from the zero vibrational level of TICT is forbidden.11 Nevertheless, higher asymmetric vibrational
bands of TICT could be used to produce radiative transition from the
TICT to ground state. Upon heating, these vibrational bands become
activated that increased fluorescence intensity. 3 showed
a slight decrease of fluorescence intensity and λmax with increase of temperature (Figure S11). This could be due to the labile acidic proton of hydroxyl group
that might form strong intermolecular H-bonding with polar DMF solvent
molecules. Thus, 1 and 2 in DMF at room
temperature exhibited TICT-induced red-shifted fluorescence, whereas
they showed strong enhancement of fluorescence with a blue shift of
λmax at −196 °C because of prevention
of excited state conformation, and stabilizing LE state and heating
of DMF solution lead to TICT-active enhancement of fluorescence intensity
with a slight blue shift.

1, 2, and 3 compounds also
showed weak-to-moderate fluorescence in the solid state (Figure 3). 1 and 2 showed fluorescence at 455 nm, whereas 3 showed fluorescence at 463 nm. 1 exhibited
relatively weak fluorescence (2.16%) efficiency compared to 2 (10.91%) and 3 (9.45%). Excited-state lifetime
studies of all three compounds showed triexponential decay with a
similar lifetime (Table S1, Figure S15). At −196 °C, solid-state
fluorescence of all three compounds showed slightly blue-shifted fluorescence
(Figure S16). This may be due to the reduction
of thermal vibration of molecules under low temperature. The fluorescence
of 1 and 2 blue-shifted from 455 to 442
nm, whereas the fluorescence of 3 blue-shifted from 464
to 446 nm. The solid-state fluorescence and presence of acid-responsive
amine nitrogen is expected to display halochromism.34 Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) exposure onto 1 leads to a strong red shift of fluorescence from 455 to 563 nm,
whereas NH3 exposure reverts to initial state (Figure 4a). Similarly, 2 exhibited fluorescence switching between 455 and 587 nm
upon TFA exposure followed by NH3 exposure (Figure 4b). Although TFA exposure of 3 resulted in a strong red shift of fluorescence from 463
to 600 nm, NH3 exposure did not completely revert the fluorescence
to the initial state, rather it blue-shifted to 508 nm with a small
hump at 463 nm (Figure 4c). Single-crystal structural analysis for all three compounds has
been performed to gain insights into the solid-state fluorescence
properties. The TPA group of 1, 2, and 3 exhibited a propeller-shaped structure and D–A part
of TPA phenyl and imidazole unit exhibited nearly coplanar conformation
(Figure 4d). It is
noted that the TPA phenyl and imidazole units are slightly twisted
in 1 and 2, whereas perfect planar conformation
in 3. The molecules formed dimer with opposite molecular
orientation in the crystal lattice of 1, 2, and 3 via weak intermolecular interaction (Figure 5). Twisted molecular
conformation of 1 and 2 leads to weak C–H···π
intermolecular interactions between molecules in the crystal lattice,
whereas planar phenyl and thiazole unit produced strong π···π
interactions in the crystal lattice. The structure collected at room
temperature (298 K) as well as at low temperature (100 K) did not
show significant variation in the molecular packing (Figures S17–S19). The coplanar conformation along with
dimer formation with opposite molecular arrangement produced blue
fluorescence in the solid state. To understand the TFA-induced fluorescence
switching, we have tried to grow single crystals in the presence of
TFA. However, only 3 with TFA produced quality crystals
that showed inclusion of two TFA molecules in the crystal lattice
(Figure 6). One of
the TFA exhibited deprotonation that leads to protonation of benzothiazole
nitrogen. The protonation of nitrogen might further increase the electron-withdrawing
ability of thiazole and hence leads to red-shifted fluorescence. Strong
intermolecular H-bonding between 3 and protonated as
well as deprotonated TFA produced dimer in the crystal lattice. Calculation
of optical band gap using a single-crystal structure suggested lowest
band gap for 3 and highest for 2, which
supported the solid-state fluorescence (Table S1). Highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO) of 1, 2, and 3 has been calculated using Gaussian 09 program package to
demonstrate CT from TPA donor to thiazole acceptor (Figure 7). The HOMO of 1, 2, and 3 revealed the presence of more
electron density on the TPA unit, whereas the electron density was
completely transferred to thiazole unit in LUMO.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion,
the fluorescence of TPA–benzothiazole-based
D–A derivatives has been modulated by controlling LE and TICT
formation in polar solvents, and rare positive enhancement of fluorescence
via TICT-active state has also been demonstrated. Solvent-dependent
LE and TICT state formation was confirmed using absorption and fluorescence
spectra, excited-state lifetime, and quantum yields. Freezing DMF
solution of 1, 2, and 3 stabilizes
the LE state and prevents ultrafast conversion to TICT and exhibits
strong enhanced blue-shifted fluorescence. Free mobility of molecules
in liquid state undergoes LE to TICT state conversion and shows red-shifted
fluorescence. Interestingly, activation of more vibrational bands
of TICT state upon heating the DMF solution leads to increase of fluorescence
intensity with a slight blue shift of fluorescence. Solid-state structural
analysis revealed more planar D–A conformation and dimer formation
in the crystal lattice that exhibited blue fluorescence. The acid-responsive
imidazole nitrogen was used for demonstrating halochromism. Thus,
the fluorescence properties of D–A molecules could be switched
reversibly by controlling the temperature.
