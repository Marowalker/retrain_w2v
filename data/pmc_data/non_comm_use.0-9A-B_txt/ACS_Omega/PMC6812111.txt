α-Fe2O3 samples
were manufactured
by means of the polymeric precursor method. The powders were sintered
and calcined at temperatures of 300–700 °C for 2 h, respectively.
In the X-ray diffraction results, the formation of the rhombohedral
phase without secondary phases was exhibited. The size of the particle
increased after calcination at 700 °C, exhibiting a slightly
more irregular morphology for the samples calcined with the addition
of NH4OH in the synthesis process. From the field-emission
scanning electron microscopy measurements, the particle size was determined,
showing a smaller size for the samples without NH4OH in
the synthesis process. The samples calcined at 600 °C had a size
of 100 nm, with the sizes for lower temperatures being smaller. The
size of the nanoparticle agglomerates was largest for the samples
with NH4OH; however, the zeta potential was slightly lower
over time for these samples. The phase study of the α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles was confirmed by means of Raman
spectroscopy, without additional bands of another crystal structure.
In addition, the synthesized nanoparticles exhibited good photocatalytic
activity in the degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) and atrazine (ATZ)
within 40 min, with a maximum degradation of 59% for ATZ and 40% for
rhodamine. The best responses in the degradation were for the samples
without the addition of NH4OH in the synthesis process
and in proportions lower than 0.1 g. The cytotoxic effects of the
nanoparticles obtained at 600 °C were evaluated in apical cells
of onion roots. The results are promising for future applications
because no changes were observed in the mitosis of the cells.

1 Introduction
Iron oxide nanostructures
constitute a very important class of materials used in a variety of
fields, including catalytic applications.1−4 From the industrial
point of view, the main advantages are that the materials are prepared
in a nontoxic and economical way and have different crystalline structures
that possess unique properties.5 The functionality
of the materials can be improved when their crystal sizes are limited
to the nanoscale and the morphology is controlled in order to produce
a high surface area.1,6 Iron oxide nanoparticles (NPs)
are the most popular magnetic NPs used in biomedical applications,
due to their low cost, low toxicity, and unique magnetic properties.6,7 Iron oxide has been used in the cosmetic industry, as well as TiO2, ZrO2, ZnO, CeO2, and α-Fe2O3, which can act as sun protection factors or
pigments in cosmetic products.6,8

Iron oxide NPs
have attracted attention because of their unique properties, such
as their superparamagnetism and surface–volume ratio.9 Various physical, chemical, and biological methods
have been adopted in order to synthesize NPs.5,9 Iron
oxides exhibit great potential in the field of life sciences, such
as biomedicine, agriculture, and environmental remediation.10 The decomposition/degradation of organic dyes
has been studied extensively in the literature, using visible light
in the catalytic process. For this purpose, various materials have
been studied, among them iron oxide,11 hematite
has also been used as a biomarker in Parkinson’s disease.12−14

Nanostructured materials
with unique physical and chemical properties are useful for the detection
of pesticides, especially in surface and ground water.15 These NPs are also promising tools for strategies
for the elimination and degradation of pesticides in order to remedy
environmental pollution in different areas.16 Some papers in the literature describe the use of iron-based compounds
for the degradation of pesticides, nevertheless the cytotoxic effects
of these NPs have not been evaluated appropriately.17−19 The nanomaterials mentioned seem promising;
however, most have not yet been studied in real-world applications.9,20 Therefore, research efforts are still needed in this area, focused
on the creation of profitable and rapid devices in the field of detection
and degradation in contaminated areas.18,21 The surface
activity of NPs plays a critical role in the catalytic reactions used
to degrade pesticides, resulting in the formation of benign products.22 All particle systems in aqueous medium carry
an electrical charge that can be positive, negative, or neutral. In
the NPs that derive from the dissociation of an acid group, they produce
a negative charge on the surface, while the dissociation of a basic
group of NPs produces a surface with a positive charge.23

In this article, the synthesis of NPs
of an iron oxide n-type semiconductor with a band gap of 2.1 eV24 and antiferromagnetic properties was studied.
A comparative study was carried out by means of the polymeric precursor
method25−27 with sintered
samples and without the addition of ammonium hydroxide in the synthesis
process. The samples were calcined at different temperatures. The
synthesized powder was characterized via powder X-ray diffraction
(XRD), Raman spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy
(FEG–SEM), and zeta potential and UV–vis spectrophotometry
in the degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) and atrazine (ATZ). A study
of the effects of the cytotoxicity of NPs of hematite in the roots
of Allium schoenoprasum cepa was also
carried out.

Hematite NPs have also been demonstrated to be
safe for use in biomedical applications.28,29 For
this reason, it is important to study the cytotoxic effects of this
type of nanomaterials. In the literature, there are several investigations
where the root tips of several plant species have been used for the
study of induced chromosomal aberrations. Its importance lies in the
fact that the root meristems contain a high proportion of cells in
mitosis, which facilitates the incidence of toxic contaminants in
the cells. The degree of alteration of the roots will depend on the
nature and toxicity of the substances and the time they remain exposed.30,31 This present study demonstrates the important role played by the
synthesis, temperature, size of agglomerate, zeta potential, and the
behavior of the vibrational modes in the material in improving the
catalytic performance. Therefore, we provide a study where environmentally
friendly α-Fe2O33 NPs were synthesized
via the polymeric precursor method for water remediation. α-Fe2O3 particulate displayed efficient photocatalytic
response for RhB and ATZ degradation in 40 min. No alterations were
exhibited in the mitosis stage in the α-Fe2O3 cytotoxic assay on Allium cepa cells, suggesting a noncytotoxic character for the evaluated concentration.

2 Characterization
For the characterization of iron oxide result of the synthesis Figure 1, XRD (Shimadzu XRD
6000) at 30 mA with Cu K radiation at (1 °C min–1), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and SEM–FEG (JEOL-JSM-6701F)
were the techniques used. The Raman spectra were recorded using a
triple-grating spectrometer in the subtractive mode (Jobin Yvon, T64000),
equipped with a N2-cooled charge-coupled device detection
system. The 632 nm line of an argon ion laser was used for excitation.

2.1 Photodegradation Using the
Hematite NPs
For the photodegradation of RhB and the pesticide
ATZ, a study of the photocatalytic properties of the samples was done
in the following way: the aqueous solutions were prepared with RhB
5 mg L–1 (water), and then, in a different beaker,
50 mL of this solution of rhodamine and water was added along with
the photocatalyst. The system was maintained at room temperature under
constant stirring and illuminated by four UVC lamps (Philips TUV,
15 W, maximum emission of 254 nm). In the case of ATZ, 2.5 mg L–1 was used. The photodegradation of the dye and the
pesticide was monitored by absorbance measurements, performed on a
UV–vis spectrometer (Shimadzu, uv-1601pc) at different times
of exposure of the solution containing the photocatalyst to the light.

2.2 Cytotoxicity Assay
Common onion, A. cepa, seeds were
used for the cytotoxicity analysis. Initially, the seeds were placed
in Petri dishes in contact with water for germination. After growth
to 1.0–2.0 cm length, the seeds were exposed to 2.5 mg L–1 hematite particles for 24 h at room temperature.
After the contact time, the roots were exposed to Carnoy’s
solution, 3:1 (v/v) ethanol/acetic acid, for 24 h. In the next stage,
acid hydrolysis, HCl (1 N), was carried out for 9 min at 60 °C,
in order to perform the fixing of the dye in the cells. Then, the
roots were washed with water and remained for 2 h in the dark in contact
with the Schiff’s reagent. With the aid of a microscope, Nova
107, the meristematic system of A. cepa cells was observed.

3 Results and Discussion
The structural changes caused
by thermal treatment of the prepared samples were studied via XRD. Figure 2A shows the XRD spectrum
of α-Fe2O3 NPs prepared at different calcination
temperatures for samples prepared without the addition of ammonium
hydroxide. The characteristic diffraction peaks of the samples coincide
with the standard pattern of the rhombohedral phase of α-Fe2O3. The peaks of the XRD correspond to the lattice
planes (012), (104), (110), (113), (024), (116), (018), (214), and
(300). The diffraction peaks of the samples are clear for the samples
annealed at 500° and 600 °C, which indicates that the α-Fe2O3 NPs are in a better state of crystallinity compared
to 300 °C.

(α-Fe2O3) NPs, without the addition of
ammonium hydroxide
at different calcination temperatures (300, 400, 500, and 600 °C).
(B) NPs, with the addition of ammonium hydroxide at different calcination
temperatures (300, 400, 500, and 600 °C) and (C) XRD pattern
of hematite, at a temperature of 700 °C of calcination; (a) without
ammonium hydroxide, (b) with addition of NH4OH.

In Figure 2B, XRD patterns can be seen for the powders with the
addition of ammonium hydroxide, which confirm the crystal structure
of the rhombohedral hematite type. The XRD pattern of the precursor,
shown in Figure 2B
for 300 °C, does not exhibit all the peaks, due to its low crystal
order nature, in comparison to Figure 2A. However, for higher temperatures, the crystallinity
of the material increases at the same rate as the samples without
any addition in the process. The narrow, sharp peaks indicate that
the hematite products are highly crystalline, implying that a high
purity of synthesized hematite particles is obtained by using this
synthesis method.32,33 The α-Fe2O3 structure of the samples synthesized with and without the
addition of ammonia at 700 °C was confirmed. The XRD patterns
of the samples are shown in Figure 2C. The peaks are narrow and sharp, suggesting that
the samples at 700 °C are highly crystalline, respective of the
process of synthesis.

The diffraction peaks are affected by
the crystallite size, and for that reason we used the Scherrer equation34,35Dc = Kλ/β
cos θ where K is the so-called form factor
(0.9), λ is the wavelength (0.15418 nm, Cu Kα), β
is the full width at half maximum (fwhm), and θ is the diffraction
angle. Therefore, in order to compare our results with the literature,
we used the plane (104) to calculate the size of the α-Fe2O3 crystallite. The results obtained in Table 1 agree with the data
in the literature for obtaining the hematite structure by different
methods of synthesis. α-Fe2O3 crystallite
sizes between 15.3 and 27.28 nm were obtained via the hydrothermal
method.36 Using the chemical precipitation
method, the authors demonstrated that the particle sizes increased
with an increase in the precursor concentration (21–82 nm).34 Using the same chemical method, α-Fe2O3 samples were calcined, and crystallite sizes
of 24 nm (500 °C) and 31 nm (700 °C) were obtained.37 Therefore, it is evident that our results are
comparable with those reported in the literature. Correlating the
values from Table 1 with the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) results (Supporting Information), a band of approximately
1500 cm–1 for samples at 300 °C suggests the
presence of residual carbon from the synthesis method. This fact indicates
that the material is not yet completely crystalline, and consequently
the definition of the particle boundary is not yet perfect. Upon complete
material crystallization (400 °C), the crystallites decrease,
and with increasing temperature, a tendency for increasing values
is observed, due to the improvement in mass transport.

FEG–SEM
was used for the characterization of the synthesized samples. Figure 3 shows the FEG–SEM
image of the samples of the iron oxide. In Figure 3a,b, the precalcined sample obtained during
the synthesis process can be seen without additional annealing. In Figure 3c,d, samples precalcined
at 300 °C are shown. In the precalcined samples without the addition
of ammonia (Figure 3c), a well-defined grain formation can be seen; however, in the samples
with NH4OH (Figure 3d), it can be seen that the samples present low crystallinity,
with blocks of agglomerates. This indicates that NH4OH
prejudices the formation of particles in the precalcined ones.

figures on the right, with the addition of NH4OH and figures
on the left, without addition of NH4OH. (a,b) Precalcined
samples; and (c,d) samples calcined at 300 °C.

The iron oxide NPs sintered via the polymer precursor method are
shown in Figure 4.
The images of the samples on the left are without the addition of
ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH) and on the right with the addition
of NH4OH (NH3) in the process. The annealing
temperatures for the samples are from 400 to 700 °C. It was found
that the calcination temperature had little effect on the particle
size up to 600 °C. Figure 4 shows iron oxide NP images of FEG–SEM in the form
of rice grains with small necks. Nonetheless, the particles are more
regular for temperatures of 400 to 600 °C. For 700 °C, the
particles have an irregular, elongated shape, this being more uniform
for the samples without NH4OH in the process. As can be
seen, the samples calcined at 700 °C exhibited considerable growth
in comparison with the other calcinations. This indicates that starting
at 700 °C, the calcination favors an increase in the particle
size in both cases. According to Lassoued et al.,12 NP size depends on the concentration of the precursor used
in the synthesis of hematite. The particle size increased with a rise
in the concentration of iron chloride hexahydrate.

at 400 °C; (c,d) samples annealed at 500 °C; (e,f) samples
annealed at 600 °C, and (g,h), respectively, at 700 °C.

In Figure 5, by way of example,
the particle size for the samples at 600 °C was calculated because
starting at this temperature the size seems to be larger for higher
temperatures, and the particle size seems smaller for temperatures
lower than 600 °C. ImageJ software was used for particle analysis.
A count of 100 particles was performed, in which the length of each
particle was found because these particles have an elongated shape,
as seen in the SEM figures. For the sample with the addition of NH4OH, the particle size was 139 ± 14 nm, while for the
sample of Figure 5b
without the addition of ammonium hydroxide it was 100 ± 23 nm.
This result indicates that the particle size is smaller for the sample
without NH4OH, and in addition, the distribution of particles
is a little better for this sample compared to the sample in Figure 5a.

size distribution histogram and figure (a) sample with annealing at
600 °C with the addition of NH4OH in the process;
(b) sample calcined at 600 °C without NH4OH in the

Particle
size control is very important for the photocatalysis process. In
the literature, it is reported that NPs of controlled size showed
high catalytic activity such as Fe3O4,38 in addition to being an effective catalyst material
for the degradation of organic pollutants.39 Fe3O4 NPs have also been used as the solid
support for the development of magnetically recoverable catalytic
systems.40 When comparing the morphology/size
of Figure 5a,b in the
sample with ammonia, it is difficult to calculate with a greater degree
of precision its particle size compared to the particles at 600 °C
obtained without ammonia because the latter have a little more regular
and defined form, and also their particle size is smaller. This property
of its morphology and size is associated with increased photocatalytic
activity because of its surface area and possibly its morphology’s
influencing the cytotoxicity results. Through analyses of the samples
heat-treated at 600 °C in Figure 5a,b, a decrease of particle size distributions was
observed without NH4OH addition. This fact can be explained
by the elimination of gaseous NH4 during the polyester
pyrolysis with treatment at 300 °C for obtaining the precalcined
samples (precursor). The elimination of NH4 produces a
more porous precursor than without NH4 addition, with a
greater and consequently more reactive surface area. In the crystallization
stage, the reactivity favors mass transport, increasing the particle
size diameters, during crystallization temperatures from 400 to 700
°C.

In Figure 6A, the measurement for the DLS of the particles is shown.
The measurement obtained by DLS can only be a particle agglomerate
in water and not the individual particles that were observed via FEG–SEM.
The diameter of the agglomerates increases when the calcination temperature
increases in Figure 6A(a), especially for samples with the addition of NH4OH
in the synthesis. For the samples without the addition of ammonium
hydroxide, the diameter of the agglomerate remains practically constant.
In zeta potential, results show agglomeration size results similar
to the literature.23 Measurements of the
potential in relation to the time and diameter of the agglomerates
were studied by Michael et al.23 for TiO2, Fe2O3, Al2O3, ZnO, and CeO2. They found that the size of the NP agglomerates
increased in α-Fe2O3 over time and with
an increase in the zeta potential. Comparable values in the literature
of the zeta potential were observed for the sample with NH4OH heat treated at 300 °C, with values for γ-Fe2O3 at pH 10 found in the literature,41 which represented an important characteristic for obtaining
iron oxide nanochains.42 In Figure 6B, the zeta potential can be
seen as a function of the calcination temperature. The zeta potential
increases when the calcination temperature increases, being higher
for the samples without the addition of NH4OH. In the literature,
some authors say that factors such as pH can influence the zeta potential
of different NPs.23 Other factors to be
taken into account when measuring the zeta potential are the material
under study, the suspension medium, the agglomeration of particles,
and external factors such as the flow of hydrogen ions (H+) in the solution. The zeta potential represents the charge of a
NP. However, as seen in Figure 6A, it is not a real measure of the individual particle surface
charge. We can say that the conditions under which the potential is
measured are very important and that there are many variables that
can influence the final results. Because the purpose of this work
is the application of α-Fe2O3 particles
in aqueous media for photocatalytic processes, the evaluations of
the agglomerate formation and surface potential in water are extremely
important for understanding the material behavior.

Figure 6 (a) Particle size agglomeration (nm) as a function
of
the calcination temperature; (b) zeta potential values of samples
calcined and different temperatures. As a dispersant, water at 25
°C was used, in a time of 20 min for all samples. In figures
(A,B), (a) samples with NH4OH and (b) samples without ammonia
in the synthesis are shown.

By means
of the DLS measurements, large agglomerate sizes were observed despite
the high loading of the zeta measurements. It could be expected that
with this zeta charge, the agglomeration of the particles would be
low. However, the method of polymer precursors that involves calcination
stages for the formation of the phase of interest, causing that agglomeration/aggregation
to occur. This is due to the diffusion process that results in the
mass transport of the particles for the crystallization stage. An
advantage
of this method is obtaining pure phases, having byproducts CO2 in gaseous form and water, that is, without residues to discard
and/or treatment. However, the agglomeration/aggregation of particles
occurs in heat treatment.

Figure 7 shows the Raman spectra for α-Fe2O3 synthesized at different annealing temperatures 300,
400, 500, 600, and 700 °C at room temperature using 632 nm excitation
wavelengths. The spectra show seven phonons in particular, five related
to the Eg modes and two related to the A1g mode.
In the Raman spectroscopy results, no other iron oxide was detected.
In Figure 7a, the Raman
spectra can be seen for the samples calcined from 300 to 700 °C,
samples without the addition of NH4OH in their synthesis.
The sample at 300 °C exhibits the main bands of α-Fe2O3; however, they are wide bands with low intensity,
and are indicative of the low crystallinity material in the sample.
For the other samples, the bands are narrower and of a higher intensity
indicative of a more crystalline material. In these spectra, the seven
typical phonons of hematite can be seen without any contamination
of any other oxide product of iron. In Figure 7b, the Raman spectra of iron oxide with NH4OH in the synthesis process are shown. As can be seen in the
spectra of the samples calcined from 300 to 700 °C, the Raman
spectrum for the 300 °C sample is practically amorphous, with
three very broad bands. In these samples, the Raman bands A1g (2) and Eg (3) are practically not exhibited; the band
Eg (3) is covered by the Eg (2). However, the
bands are smaller and less intense compared to the Raman spectra of Figure 9a. In addition, the
widths of the large lines and changes in the wave number of the Raman
peaks could be due to the effects of phonon confinement in the nanocrystals.

Figure 7 (a) Raman spectra
for samples without addition
of NH4OH at different calcination temperatures. (b) Raman
spectra for samples with addition of NH4OH at different
calcination temperatures.

Using the PeakFit program, the peak position and fwhm was found.
The analysis was carried out modeling a set of Lorentzian spectral
functions. As an example, we took only two Raman bands, which appear
in Figure 8, but the
position of the Raman peaks and the fwhm was found for all modes. Figure 8 shows the position
of the phonons A1g43 and Eg;44 furthermore, there is also
the fwhm for the different samples calcined at different temperatures,
where Figure 8a shows
the samples without ammonium hydroxide and 8b with NH4OH. It can be seen that the change in the position
is greater for the samples with the addition of NH4OH in
the process; however, for the other samples, the temperature only
changes the position of the Raman modes a little. Compared the fwhm
value of the different samples, for Figure 8b, this value is higher. Generally, these
data are related to the stresses and the crystallinity within the
sample. The peak shifted and the fwhm increased; this may also be
indicative of the particle size in Figure 8b. Therefore, a majority of published studies
refer to Raman dependence and particle size by means of the phonon
confinement model. The optical phonon bands show changes with the
particle size.45,46 In other words, comparing (a)
and (b) of Figure 8, we can say that in sample (b), the structural changes are greater,
possibly because they exhibit more amorphous material or very irregular
changes in their particles.

samples with NH4OH. Position of the Raman peak as a function

The degradation process of rhodamine
can be seen in Figure 9. As a catalyst agent, samples of 500 and
600 °C (0.01 and 0.05 g/L) were used, with and without the addition
of NH4OH. In particular, RhB is an amphoteric dye, although
it is also classified as basic due to its positive total charge. It
exhibits strong fluorescence.47−53Figure 9a shows the degradation of
RhB for samples with and without the addition of ammonia at 500 °C.
For the sample at 500 °C without NH4OH and 0.05 g,
the degradation of rhodamine is greater compared to the samples with
pH = 7 and concentrations of 0.01 and 0.05 g/L of hematite. In Figure 9b, the degradation
of RhB can be seen for the samples calcined at 600 °C. As can
be seen, the sample that responds better to the degradation was the
sample without the addition of NH4OH at a concentration
of 0.05 g/L. Otherwise, the best samples with respect to the degradation
of ATZ and rhodamine were the samples without the addition of ammonium
hydroxide. The behavior for the samples with the addition of NH4OH is not the best. This behavior could be related to the
particle size, which began to increase with the calcination temperature,
and therefore possibly influenced its effectiveness in the degradation
of rhodamine. In Figure 9a the degradation of rhodamine with the samples calcined at 500 °C
and a time of 120 min, the degradation was 28%. In the case of Figure 9b, for the samples
at 600 °C and time of 100 min the degradation was 40%.

Figure 9 For every 500
mL of water
was added 5 mg of RhB. In 20 mL of the previous fluid is added 0.01
and 0.05 g of the sample for the photocatalytic study of rhodamine.
(a) Calcined samples at 500 °C with and without NH4OH. (b) Samples at 600 °C with and without NH4OH
in the process.

In Figure 10, the
effect of the amount of the catalyst on ATZ degradation can be seen.
To avoid sedimentation in the process of degradation of ATZ, the samples
were kept under constant stirring. The degradation rate of ATZ depends
on the concentration of the photocatalyst. In Figure 10a, we have the sample of hematite at 400
°C without the addition of NH4OH in the process. By
increasing the concentration of the catalyst, the number of molecules
adsorbed increases, increasing the rate of degradation. However, the
change is not significant for the concentrations of 0.01 and 0.05
g/L. In Figure 10b,
the catalyst isα-Fe2O3 without NH4OH. 0.01, 0.05, and 0.1 g of the sample at 500 °C were
used for these tests. With this sample, the degradation was much better
compared to the sample at 400 °C. However, the turbidity of the
suspension increased; therefore, the photodegradation was less effective.54 In Figure 10c, we have a comparison of the sample with ammonia
and without it in the synthesis process for temperatures at 500 and
600 °C. The amount of the α-Fe2O3 sample that was used for the degradation was 0.03 g in all four
cases. As seen in Figure 10c, the samples that responded better to the degradation during
a period of 40 min were the samples without addition of ammonium hydroxide
in the process. The degradation of ATZ in the conditions already described
was as follows: for NPs at 400 °C of the 27%, for samples at
500 °C of the 59% and finally for samples at 600 °C was
the 35%.

Figure 10 For every 500 mL of water was added 2.5
mg of ATZ. In
20 mL of the previous fluid is added of the sample for the photocatalytic.

Photocatalysis assays under conditions similar to the
present investigation can be found in the literature with different
nanoparticulate oxide photocatalysts. Mourao et al.55 synthesized TiO2 NPs using the hydrothermal
method at different temperatures (125–250 °C) and exposed
them from 1 to 4 h to a photocatalytic process. As a result, the TiO2 sample that showed the best performance for methylene blue
was synthesized at 250 °C for 2 h, degrading about 99% of the
dye in 60 min. The authors correlated this response to the highest
TiO2 crystallinity obtained under the synthesis conditions,
demonstrating the importance of this parameter in the photocatalytic
process. Lopes et al.56 obtained nanoparticulate
Nb2O5 with an average size between 31 and 35
nm via a hydrothermal route at 125 °C for 12 h. In the RhB photocatalytic
application, Nb2O5 promoted a 50% degradation
of the dye in 300 min, being superior to TiO2 (P25) under
the same conditions. This result was correlated with the better availability
of hydroxyl radicals for pollutant degradation from the Nb2O5 catalyst. Oliveira et al.57 obtained N-doped ZnO NPs smaller than 50 nm from the addition of
urea to the sol–gel synthesis. In photocatalytic activity against
RhB dye, ZnO/N exhibited a degradation of about 80% in 120 min, being
superior to pure ZnO, with an efficacy of 20%. de Castro et al.58 elaborated a TiO2/WO3 heterostructure,
varying the TiO2 concentration from 10 to 90% in the composition.
In the degradation of RhB dye, it was observed that a 50% ratio (w/w)
was the heterostructure with the best result in relation to the dye,
degrading about 99% after 200 min. TiO2/WO3 performance
was higher when compared to isolated WO3 and TiO2, with values of 25 and 65%, respectively, being attributed to changes
in the donor–receptor electronic levels of pure materials.
Regarding hematite, Yang et al.59 obtained
NPs via the hydrothermal method for RhB degradation in the presence
of H2O2 with exposure to the visible region.
The result was that hematite NPs with a size of 100–150 nm,
in the presence of 0.3 mL of H2O2 (30% v/v)
under 180 min visible exposure, allowed complete dye degradation.
In the present investigation, 80–120 nm hematite NPs in the
UV–vis region without the presence of H2O2 allowed the degradation of 40% RhB dye and 35% ATZ pesticide after
only 40 min of exposure. Thus, the obtained result demonstrates that
the hematite NPs exhibit significant and competitive photocatalytic
activity compared to the other oxides evaluated in the literature.

Higher photocatalytic activity was associated with a smaller particle
size and greater specific surface area. Nevertheless, when looking
at Figures 9 and 10, both for ATZ and for rhodamine in the various
assays that were performed in the laboratory, the best response obtained
was for samples at 600 °C, and especially for the sample without
the addition of ammonia. This response is possibly related to the
particle size crystallinity because the samples at 500 °C were
slightly smaller but less crystalline. A similar behavior was observed
by Mourao et al.55 for TiO2 NPs.
It was observed in the present investigation that is possible to obtain
better results for photocatalytic activity with samples heat treated
at temperatures lower than 700 °C; with larger particle sizes,
the samples practically did not respond. This indicates that particle
size and crystallinity are essential for photocatalytic activity in
α-Fe2O3 samples obtained via the polymeric
precursor method.

In the assay of cytotoxicity in the roots
of A. cepa, the hematite particles
(at 600 °C) were used at a concentration of 2.5 × 10–3 g/mL, due to the better photocatalysis conditions
that was observed, Figure 10b (0.05 g in 20 mL). It is possible to verify through the
images, Figure 11a–c,
that the NPs did not cause changes during the mitosis of the cells.
In Figure 11a–c,
it the dividing cells during the prophase, metaphase, and anaphase
steps are shown, respectively. In addition, abnormalities regarding
mutations and/or changes in mitotic behavior expected for cell division
are not seen. Batista-Gallep et al.60 observed
that at low concentrations of Fe2O3 NPs (1.96
× 109 NPs/mL), the toxicity effect on A. cepa was lower when compared to high concentrations
(39 × 109 NPs/mL). Kaygisiz and Cigerci61 found that in particles smaller than 100 nm,
independent of the concentration present, the hematite particles exhibited
chromosomal alterations in the mitotic division. Also previous results
in a commercial Madin–Darby canine kidney cell with hematite
NPs have shown that size and morphology influence cytotoxicity.62 The authors demonstrate that the degree of internalization
in the cells was favored by the stick-shaped NPs and not the spherical
ones, due to the greater surface area. In other studies,63 hematite has also been successfully used in
the human lung fibroblast cell line (MRC5), with low levels of cytotoxicity.
Thus, the result found in the present investigation may be due to
the concentration used in the test, 2.5 × 10–3 g/mL, as well as the particle size, mostly around 100–200
nm, presenting a low oxidative stress effect in the cells and consequently
lower toxicity due to the low effect with respect to the nanometric
size (<100 nm). The NPs used for the cytotoxicity assay were from
the sample at 600 °C without ammonia, with a crystallite size
of 25.3 nm, due to their better response in photocatalysis. From the
results of photocatalysis, Figure 10, and cytotoxicity, Figure 11, the hematite NPs obtained with a polymeric
precursor exhibited promising results for the degradation of pollutants
in an aqueous medium, with a low harmful effect on the ecosystem.

4 Conclusions
The
synthesis procedure that was carried out is low-cost, and it was possible
to obtain samples with an orthorhombic crystalline structure of α-Fe2O3. The particle size obtained in this study was
lower for the calcined samples without the NH4OH addition
in the synthesis process, and for temperatures lower than 600 °C,
the particle size was lower than 110 nm. Raman spectroscopy verified
the synthesis of the hematite, finding the seven Raman phonons (two
A1g and five Eg), without additional bands,
indicating a pure structure for the samples. By means of XRD analysis,
it was also verified that the samples with better crystallinity were
the samples free of NH4OH in the synthesis. In α-Fe2O3 photocatalytic investigation toward rhodamine
and ATZ degradation, the best responses were found for the samples
without NH4OH in the synthesis process, with the efficacy
of, respectively, 40 and 59% in 40 min.

The α-Fe2O3 particles showed no cytotoxicity to A. cepa cells for samples calcined at 600 °C
with a concentration of 2.5 × 10–3 g/mL, constituting
a promising biocompatible alternative with an adequate degradation
rate for the rhodamine and ATZ pollutants. Once, that toxicity is
a limiting factor for the application of nanoparticulate materials
in photodegradation systems, α-Fe2O3 particles
obtained by the polymeric precursor method are excellent candidates
in these kinds applications.

5 Experimental Details
5.1 Synthesis Procedure of the α-Fe2O3 Nanocomposite
To obtain the samples, the polymeric precursor
method was used,32 which is based on the
completion of metal cations by a hydroxycarboxylic acid, in this case
citric acid. The completion process occurs when salts and citric acid
are mixed in aqueous solution.32,33,35 The chemicals used were: iron(III) nitrate 9-hydrate, (Fe(NO)3O) (98%, Mallinckrodt), ethylene glycol (EG), HOCH2CH2OH (≥99.0%, Merck), anhydrous citric acid, C6H8O7, ((99%) Dinâmica), ammonium
hydroxide, and NH4OH (28–30%, Synth). Deionized
water was obtained from the Milli-Q Water Purification System. EG
was added to this solution, keeping the temperature constant until
the water is removed and a polymer resin is formed. Afterward, the
samples were subjected to a thermal treatment in order to eliminate
organic matter and crystallize the material of interest (α-Fe2O3). In this investigation, the iron oxide NPs
were sintered in the following way: 21.7 g of citric acid, Milli-Q
(200 mL), was added to water with constant stirring at 90 °C.
The polymeric precursor solution was prepared using 15.2 g of iron(III)
nitrate, which was added under constant stirring for half an hour
at a temperature of 90 °C. After total dissolution, 13 mL of
EG was added to the solution, with a (mass) proportion of citric acid/EG
of 60:40 w/w. At the end of the reaction, a resin was obtained. During
the preparation, Figure 1, method A was without the addition of ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH) and method B with the addition of NH4OH as
a pH controller agent. In method B, the citric acid (AC) and the iron(III)
nitrate 9-hydrate in a molar ratio of 3:1 (AC/Fe) were solubilized
in water under magnetic stirring. In this stage, the pH was varied
to 7 with NH4OH addition for comparing with the synthesis
without pH adjust. The EG was added to the reaction medium in a ratio
of 60% AC to 40% EG and heated at 90 °C under magnetic stirring
for obtaining a polyester. The polyester was calcined in a muffle
furnace (3000 EDG) at 300 °C for 2 h, under a heating rate of
10 °C min–1, producing a precalcined material.
The precalcined samples were de-agglomerated using a mortar and pistil
and heat treated from 300 to 700 °C for 2 h for the crystallization
process of the two methods (A and B).
