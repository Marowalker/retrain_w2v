A new
efficient approach has been reported for the tritylation
of primary alcohols
over secondary alcohols using triphenyl methyl alcohol and 4-monomethoxyl
trityl alcohols in the presence of imidazolium-based ionic liquid
1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrachloroaluminate as catalyst. At room
temperature, 5 mol % of catalyst in dichloromethane and acetonitrile
solvent has been shown to be excellent for the tritylation of benzyl
alcohol and various other alcohols The method was compatible with
Fmoc/acetyl protecting group of amino and tert-butyldiphenylsilyl
ether protecting group of alcohol. Moreover, the catalyst was reused
for three to four catalytic cycles with little loss of catalytic activity.
Excellent yields, reusability, chemoselectivity, and easy workup are
advantages of this protocol.

Introduction
In recent advancements,
environmental benign acid-catalyzed ionic
liquids (ILs) have been demonstrated to be efficient and versatile
catalysts and reaction media for various organic transformations.1 The protection of hydroxyl functionalities is
often required in multistep synthetic procedures.2 The triphenyl methyl (trityl) groups are frequently used
as a protecting group for primary alcohols mainly in nucleoside and
carbohydrate chemistry due to their significant stability during neutral/basic
conditions and afford corresponding alcohols under mild acidic condition.3−5 Triaryl has wide applications in organic synthesis (including synthesis
of DNA, RNA, and peptides), industrial and medicinal chemistry, as
protecting group, and in dyes and photochromic agents.

Tritylation
of alcohols as trityl ether were generally carried
out by reaction of alcohols with triphenyl methyl halides in the presence
of base,6−14 such as pyridine, 4-dimethylaminopyridine, 2,4,6-collidine, triethylamine,
and 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene. There are limited reports
in the literature where triphenyl methanol (Tr-OH) was used for protection
of alcohols as trityl ethers15−20 in the presence of an acidic catalyst. Saha and co-workers reported
surfactant-mediated etherification of alcohols in presence of metal
salt (Lewis acid)-based catalyst.21−23

Tritylation, generally
a two-step reaction, proceeds through an
SN1 mechanism24 via attack of
triphenylmethylcarbonium ion on the nucleophilic substrate (alcohol).
Lundquist et al. reported silver(I) trifluoromethanesulfonate-mediated
tritylation of alcohols through trityl chloride resin25 to enhance the activity of the standard trityl chloride.
Additionally, a majority of catalysts used for protection of alcohols
are not recoverable and thus cannot be used in further successive
reactions.

Trityl alcohol is stable, whereas trityl chloride
is moisture sensitive
and typically prepared from trityl alcohols, and thus the latter could
cheaper. On the basis of this evidence, we use trityl alcohol as a
tritylating reagent in our studies. To the best of our knowledge,
there are no reports in the literature so far on tritylation of alcohols
with triphenyl methanol (Tr-OH)/4-monomethoxyl trityl alcohols (MMTr-OH)
using Lewis acid-based ionic liquid (EMIM·AlCl4) as
a catalyst. This ionic liquid has dual properties, acidic nature,
and recyclability. In this communication, to explore the feasibility
of acidic ionic liquid for the tritylation, numerous alcohols were
subjected to tritylation using Tr-OH/MMTr-OH, in dichloromethane (DCM)
at room temperature to give the corresponding O-Tr- or O-MMTr-protected
alcohols in moderate-to-excellent yield.

Results
and Discussion
To discover efficient solvents in tritylation,
we use trityl alcohol
as a tritylating agent and propargyl alcohol as a model substrate.
Varieties of solvents viz. dichloromethane, chloroform, toluene, tetrahydrofuran
(THF), acetonitrile, and dimethylformamide were examined for tritylation
reaction. The desired trityl ether was not obtained with solvents
THF and pyridine, and changing to toluene, only a small amount of
the product formed. To our delight, an encountering result was obtained
when dichloromethane and acetonitrile were used as solvents. Solvents
showed impact dramatically upon reaction (entry 5 and 6, Table 1). Among all solvents
used in the reaction, dichloromethane (DCM) was found to be most effective
in terms of yields and reaction time, as compared to other solvents
(Table 1). Thus, DCM
was used as an ideal solvent for tritylation of entire alcohol. Having
established an optimized condition, we then tested the tritylation
of various alcohols with triphenyl methyl alcohol (Tr-OH) and 4-monomethoxyl
trityl alcohols (MMTr-OH) in dichloromethane solvent.

On the basis
of the results of experiments, a reasonable mechanism
is proposed and illustrated in Scheme 1. We believe that a plausible mechanism of this reaction
could involve the initial generation of phenyl carbocation (Tr+/MMTr+) of triphenyl methyl alcohol (Tr-OH)/4-monomethoxyl
trityl alcohols (MMTr-OH) by (EMIM·AlCl4), following
which carbocation (Tr+/MMTr+) undergoes a nucleophilic
substitution with alcohol to form tritylated product of respective
alcohols. With this hypothesis in mind, we set out to examine the
tritylation of alcohols with triphenyl methyl alcohol (Tr-OH) and
4-monomethoxyl trityl alcohols (MMTr-OH) using Lewis acid-based ionic
liquid as a catalyst.

Scheme 1 Proposed Mechanism of Tritylation of Alcohol
in Presence of Ionic
Liquid EMIM·AlCl4
As shown in Table 2, the catalyst loading was assorted from 1 to 10 mol % to
find out
the optimum concentration of catalyst. EMIM·AlCl4 (5
mol %) afforded the corresponding tritylating product in high yields.
Thus, 5 mol % EMIM·AlCl4 catalyst was used for the
entire tritylation reaction. In the separate control experiment, we
found that no product formation was observed in the absence of catalyst.
Hence, to be successful, in this reaction, the presence of catalyst
is essential (Table 2). To exhibit the efficiency and generality of this protocol, we
explored the reaction of various alcohols (1b–k) with triphenyl methyl alcohol (Tr-OH) and 4-monomethoxyl trityl
alcohols (MMTr-OH). The results are summarized in Tables 3 and 4. We have also performed DMTr-OH reaction on a number of alcohols,
under similar reaction conditions, which were used in the case of
Tr-OH and MMTr-OH, but this did not work well for DMTr-OH.

The recycling of catalyst (EMIM·AlCl4) has been
investigated by using reaction for synthesis of compound 2a. The catalyst was used directly without any further purification
for the next protection reaction with fresh starting materials. The
activities of the recovered resultant IL (catalyst) were investigated
by reaction of triphenyl methanol with propargyl alcohol. The yields
remain almost unchanged, up to three recycles of catalyst. In the
fourth cycle, even after the reaction time was prolonged to 24 h,
the conversion could not reach its optimum level. After the third
cycle, the efficiency of the catalytic system was reduced and the
yields decreased in the fifth cycle (Figure 1). Thus, this Lewis acidic-based IL can be
used for up to three consecutive cycles without any considerable loss
of the original catalytic activity. As observed from the IR and NMR,
the pattern of the recovered catalyst was the same and subsequently,
there is no considerable change in spectral properties of the parent
catalyst. These facts revealed the successful character of the EMIM·AlCl4 catalyst during reaction. Hence, in the current procedure
of tritylation of alcohols, the recovery and reusability of the catalyst
was very convenient, which is one of the key features of any catalyst.
As observed from the IR and NMR, the pattern of the recovered catalyst
was the same and so there is no considerable change in spectral properties
of the parent catalyst. These facts revealed the successful character
of the EMIM·AlCl4 catalyst during reaction.

the (EMIM·AlCl4) ionic liquid.

As can be seen, the reaction affords good to excellent yield
of
tritylated alcohols (2 and 3). In particular,
very good yield was obtained for compounds 2c/3c, 2h/3h, 2j/3j, and 2k/3k, providing a better way for
preparing tritylated alcohols. A closer inspection of the results
shown in Table 3 revealed
that the reaction worked well with aliphatic as well as aromatic substituted
alcohols, affording excellent yields of the desired products. The
reaction of electron withdrawing group containing alcohol (chloro
and fluoro group) gave very high yields of the corresponding derivatives
(Table 2; 2j,k and 3j,k) compared to that
of electron donating group containing alcohol (OCH3) (Table 2; 2g and 2i and 3g and 3i). This is due to
generation of more stable carbocation in the case of electron withdrawing
group as compared with electron donating group. Additionally, the
chemoselective tritylation of benzyl alcohol was successfully accomplished,
after 1.5 h, in the presence of a phenolic group (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Chemoselective Tritylation
of Benzyl Alcohol in the Presence of Phenol
To check the compatibility and mildness of the reagent,
this tritylation
reaction on alcohol was carried out in presence of other sensitive
functionalities. Substrates 1l–1p were selectively converted to the trityl ethers 2l–2p, without affecting the acid/base-labile protecting group
such as tert-butyldiphenylsilyl (TBDPS) groups (2l; 91%), N-Fmoc protecting group (2n; 86%), and N-acetyl group (Table 4, 2m; 90%). In
contrast, when the protection of alcohol group with trityl alcohol
was performed in Boc-Thr-OH (acid sensitive tert-butylcarbamate),
the reaction failed because the catalyst (EMIM·AlCl4) promoted Boc-deprotection rather than helping in tritylation. Substrates
(1l–1n) underwent tritylation on
the free hydroxyl group without affecting other protecting groups
present in the substrate. The results suggest that the presence of
different functional groups such as tert-butyldiphenylsilyl
ether (TBDPS) hydroxyl protecting group, base-labile N-(9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl) (N-Fmoc)/acetyl (N-Ac) amine protecting group, ester, and amide groups were
well tolerated and remained unaffected throughout tritylation reaction.
Thus, the present procedure can be employed for orthogonally protected
substrates with Fmoc, TBDPS, and N-acetyl.

The success of tritylation of primary alcohol groups encourage
us to investigate their scope in secondary and tertiary alcohols.
It is important to mention that tritylation reaction in the case of
secondary alcohols, viz., cyclohexanol, iso-propanol, diphenyl-methanol,
and tertiary alcohols like tert-butyl alcohol and
triphenyl methanol, were performed but no tritylated products were
observed with tertiary alcohols; only very less protection reaction
was observed in secondary alcohols.

The tritylation of primary
alcohol in the presence of secondary
alcohol demonstrates its selectivity toward primary alcohols over
secondary alcohols under mild reaction conditions (entry 1o and 1p).

Conclusions
In summary, we have
successfully developed a mild and efficient
procedure for tritylation of alcohols with triphenyl methyl alcohol
(Tr-OH) and 4-monomethoxyl trityl alcohol (MMTr-OH) as trityl ether
using EMIM·AlCl4 (recyclable ionic liquid) as a catalyst.
The developed method suggests numerous advantages, such as protection
of alcohols in minutes, recyclability of the ionic liquid (catalyst)
without significant loss in yield up to three cycles, selectivity
for primary alcohol over secondary alcohol, and no workup required.
The current procedures suggest that tritylation of hydroxyl group
in the presence of sensitive functionalities; for example, TBDPS, N-acetyl, or N-Fmoc-protected amino groups,
can be easily performed without affecting these protecting groups.
We believe that this potential ionic liquid can further explored for
developing several other organic transformations in future. Further
exploration of the scope of this methodology is currently underway
in our laboratory.

General
Recovery Procedure for the Catalyst
Subsequent to completion
of the first tritylation reaction between triphenyl methanol and propargyl
alcohol in the presence of (EMIM·AlCl4), the solvent
was then evaporated under vacuum and the reaction mixture was subjected
to consecutive extraction with ethyl acetate and diethyl ether (1:1)
to remove the respective tritylated compound form the reaction mixture.
The resultant catalyst (the ionic liquid) was dried under vacuum and
reused in the later reaction.
