Electrochemical
water (H2O) splitting is one of the
most promising technologies for energy storage by hydrogen (H2) generation but suffers from the requirement of high overpotential
in the anodic half-reaction (oxygen evolution), which is a four-electron
process. Though transition-metal oxides and oxysulfides are increasingly
researched and used as oxygen evolution electrocatalysts, the bases
of their differential activities are not properly understood. In this
article, we have synthesized NiCo2O4 and NiCo2OxS4–x by a chemical bath deposition technique, and the latter has
shown better oxygen evolution performance, both in terms of stability
and activity, under alkaline conditions. Comprehensive analysis through
time-dependent cyclic voltammetry, microscopy, and elemental analysis
reveal that the higher activity of NiCo2OxS4–x may be attributed to
the lower metal–sulfur bond energy that facilitates the activation
process to form the active metal hydroxide/oxyhydroxide species, higher
electrochemically active surface area, higher pore diameter and
rugged morphology that prevents corrosion. This work provides significant
insights on the advantages of sulfur-containing materials as electrochemical
precatalysts over their oxide counterparts for oxygen evolution reaction.

1 Introduction
With
increase in global population, the demand for energy is sharply
increasing. For energy generation, major economies are primarily dependent
on the consumption of fossil fuels, which leads to the emission of
toxic materials.1 These materials are responsible
for climate change that has destructive implications on the biodiversity
and sustainability of life on earth. Creating a global scale sustainable
energy generation and storage system is one of the most profound challenges
humanity is facing today.2−5

Among clean fuels, hydrogen is considered as
one of the best candidates
because of its high mass-specific energy and zero carbon emission.
Electrochemical water splitting has been considered as one of the
most promising techniques for hydrogen generation. In this process,
electrochemical energy splits water (H2O) into H2 and O2.1,6 However, this process has a positive
Gibb’s free energy (ΔG). Moreover, when
an electrochemical cell is “driven” toward completion
by applying reasonable potential, it becomes kinetically controlled
because of activation energy, ion mobility (diffusion), surface hindrance,
and entropy.7,8 In practice, catalysts are generally
employed to minimize the activation energy of the reaction.9 While hydrogen evolution is a two-electron process,
evolution of oxygen is a four-electron process, which makes the kinetics
of overall water splitting unfavorable. This has encouraged scientists
to develop efficient catalysts to lower the potential needed to perform
oxygen evolution.10 Among them, RuO2 and IrO2 have shown promising activities.11,12 However, the scarcity and cost of these metals limit their use as
catalysts in practical devices. The abundance and low-cost of transition-metal
compounds make them a prudent choice to be used as electrocatalysts.
In the last decade, enormous effort has been made in the synthesis,
characterization, and electrocatalytic performance evaluation of transition-metal
(mostly Ni, Co, and Fe) compounds.7,13,14 Recently, both nickel hydroxide and cobalt hydroxide
have shown a promising activity as bifunctional catalysts (efficient
for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution).14,15 For example, a facile synthesis of binary Ni–Fe oxide electrocatalyst
supported on Ni foam for oxygen evolution has been reported by Liu
et al.16 NiCo2S4 nanowires
synthesized on Ni foam have shown superior activity as a bifunctional
catalyst.17 Recently, Nandan et al. have
developed Fe–NxC/CNx centers as potential candidates for both oxygen
evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction and successfully
employed them as air cathodes in metal–air batteries.18,19 Although most articles solely attribute the improvement of electrocatalytic
activity of a material to the decrease in charge-transfer resistance
of a catalyst, we believe that the inherent properties (such as hard–soft
nature, electronegativity, bond dissociation energy, and so forth)
of different elements that are present in a catalyst can also be correlated
with their respective electrocatalytic activity.16,17 Moreover, recent reports indicate that the as-synthesized material
actually acts as a precatalyst, which transforms during electrochemical
measurements to produce the active catalyst layer. Therefore, it is
necessary to relate the electrocatalytic activity of a material with
the evolution of an active catalyst layer.20,21 Another major challenge in water-splitting research is the preparation
of the working electrode. For evaluating the electrocatalytic activity,
catalysts are generally drop-casted on an expensive glassy carbon
electrode in the presence of binders (such as Nafion).14,22,23 However, in practical water-splitting
devices, this may not be suitable as the materials often leach out
over time. This demands for a thin, robust, and stable catalyst layer
over a cheap conducting substrate. Techniques such as chemical vapor
deposition or physical vapor deposition are generally employed to
directly deposit catalyst layers onto conductive substrates during
catalyst synthesis. However, these methods are quite tedious and difficult
to control.24,25 Alternatively, a thin layer of
catalyst materials can also be directly grown on substrates using
hydrothermal reactors by appropriate tuning of synthetic conditions.14−17,26,27 However, it has been noticed that although the same reaction conditions
are used, minor differences in hydrothermal setup across labs often
lead to the formation of different materials. This motivated us to
develop a more general method that will use relatively cheap and easily
available equipment and is able to produce robust thin layers on substrates.

In this article, precursors of NiCo2O4 and
NiCo2OxS4–x layers were synthesized on fluorine-doped tin oxide
(FTO) glass substrates by a chemical bath deposition (CBD) technique
that requires only a glass bottle (250 mL) and a heating mantle as
the apparatus. This method produced a uniform and robust layer of
precursors, which was then annealed under specific conditions to synthesize
NiCo2O4 and NiCo2OxS4–x. This two-step method
ensures that the density and quantity of metal centers present per
unit area of the substrate remain the same for both catalysts, and
thus, any difference in catalytic activities of the two materials
cannot be attributed to the difference in loading of the catalyst
material on the substrate. The catalysts were then evaluated for their
activity toward OER. Apart from the traditional concept of considering
the charge-transfer resistance of the materials as the sole descriptor
for the difference in their catalytic activity, differences in their
rate of activation, electrochemically active surface area (ECSA),
metal–anion bond dissociation energy, porosity and resistivity
toward material corrosion were probed, and the results indicate these
parameters to be noteworthy for the proper understanding of the catalytic
performance of a material. The obtained results clearly illustrate
the advantages of using sulfur-containing electrocatalysts, both in
terms of activity and stability, compared to their oxygen counterparts
for OER under alkaline conditions.

As a further support, density
functional theoretical (DFT) calculations
were carried out and the computed results relate the increase in electrocatalytic
activity with the increase in covalency between metallic and anionic
orbitals, which in turn are dependent on the intrinsic properties
of different constituent elements in a compound.

2 Results
and Characterization
2.1 Phase and Composition Analysis
All
synthesized samples were characterized by the powder X-ray diffraction
(PXRD) technique to obtain information about their phase. The peaks
(Figure 1b) coming
from the sample prepared by annealing the precursor in atmospheric
conditions matched with the standard pattern (JCPDS—20-0781)
(Figure 1a) of NiCo2O4. However, in this spectrum, the peaks from the
FTO substrate also appear at 26°, 34°, 52°, and 62°.
Especially, the peak at 38° is enhanced in intensity because
of the overlap between the peaks originating from both the sample
and FTO. As shown in Figure 1d, most peaks in the PXRD pattern of the sample annealed under
argon atmosphere in the presence of thiourea resemble with that of
NiCo2S4 (JCPDS—43-1477) (Figure 1c). In this sample as well,
the peaks at 26°, 38° and 52° originate from the overlap
between sample peaks and FTO peaks. In addition, there are few peaks
(41°, 62°) that do not match with that of NiCo2S4. These peaks have probably originated from a small
amount of nickel oxide (NiO) that has formed as a side product during
synthesis.28

NiCo2OxS4–x. (*) indicates peaks originating from the FTO glass
substrate and (Δ) indicates peaks originating from the overlap
between diffraction from both the sample and the FTO glass substrate.

To obtain information about the
composition of different elements
in each sample, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDAX) analysis
was carried out. The samples were carefully scraped from the FTO substrate,
and the collected powder was subjected to EDAX analysis. Each sample
was synthesized twice, and EDAX was collected from five different
regions of each sample. Upon averaging the obtained values, the ratios
of different elements were found to be Ni/Co/O = 1:1.9:3.9 and Ni/Co/O/S
= 1:2.1:0.6:3.29 for NiCo2O4 and NiCo2OxS4–x, respectively (as shown in Figure S1 and Tables S1 and S2). The presence of a small amount
of O in the sample prepared under argon atmosphere in the presence
of thiourea indicates that it is not possible to entirely eliminate
oxygen by this method.

2.2 Morphology Analysis
To obtain information
about the morphology of the synthesized materials, microscopic analysis
of the products on FTO glasses was carried out. Scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) images indicate the formation of very thin flakelike
structures (about 2 μm long) with smooth surfaces for NiCo2O4 (Figure 2a,b). A closer inspection reveals the formation of relatively
smaller (50–150 nm) flakes in between the larger flakes. As
shown in Figure 2a,
the CBD technique has yielded a uniform and dense layer of NiCo2O4 on the FTO glass substrate. SEM images of NiCo2OxS4–x show a similar flaky structure but with a rugged surface (Figure 2c,d). These flakes
are however slightly thicker than those of NiCo2O4. Here again, the layer is dense and uniform in nature (Figure 2c).

2.3 Inductively
Coupled Plasma Mass Spectroscopy
(ICP-MS) Analysis
During CBD, two FTO glass electrodes were
always placed in the same bath simultaneously. Later, one of them
was converted to NiCo2O4 and the other into
NiCo2OxS4–x. This was done to ensure equal loading of the precursor
on the electrodes. To further confirm this, the materials were characterized
by the ICP-MS analysis, whose details (sample preparation, calculation,
etc.) have been presented in the Supporting Information. The results show that the amount of catalyst loading per unit area
of the electrode was 0.351 and 0.349 mg/cm2 for NiCo2O4 and NiCo2OxS4–x respectively. Moreover,
the ratio of concentrations of metal ions (Co/Ni) were found to be
1.88:1 and 1.93:1 for NiCo2O4 and NiCo2OxS4–x, respectively. This indicates that any difference in electrocatalytic
activity cannot be attributed to the difference in the number of metal
ions.

2.4 Electrochemical Activity
To evaluate
the oxygen evolution activity of both NiCo2O4 and NiCo2OxS4–x on FTO, they were characterized by electrochemical
techniques as described in section 5.1. As shown in Figure 3, NiCo2OxS4–x attains the current density of
10 mA/cm2 at 1.60 V, whereas NiCo2O4 shows a similar activity at 1.66 V. Thus, to obtain the benchmark
current density, NiCo2O4 requires about ∼60
mV more potential compared to NiCo2OxS4–x at pH 14. This clearly
suggests that NiCo2OxS4–x is a better electrocatalyst compared
to NiCo2O4 for OER under alkaline conditions.
The OER overpotential value of NiCo2OxS4–x is either better or
comparable to most other reports on NiCo-based electrocatalysts (as
shown in Table S3).

10 mV s–1) of OER at pH
14 for (a) NiCo2O4 and (b) NiCo2OxS4–x.
The inset shows the overpotential values for the electrocatalysts.

The surface area and porosity
of a material are known to have significant
effect on its catalytic activity toward any reaction. To garner information
regarding these parameters, nitrogen adsorption–desorption
measurements were conducted on catalyst nanopowders, which were prepared
by appropriate treatment (details in Materials and
Methods: Synthesis section) of the
precipitate that had formed during CBD synthesis. As shown in Figure S2, the obtained nitrogen adsorption–desorption
isotherms correspond to type IV and the H-3 hysteresis loop in the
isotherms indicate mesoporosity with a slit-like pore geometry in
both samples according to IUPAC classification.29 The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface
areas for NiCo2O4 and NiCo2OxS4–x were
found to be 83 and 16 m2 g–1, respectively.
However, the average pore diameters of NiCo2O4 and NiCo2OxS4–x were 6.5 and 14.2 nm, respectively. We believe that
despite the smaller surface area, the larger pore diameter in NiCo2OxS4–x acts as the decisive factor behind its superior electrocatalytic
activity toward OER as according to Knudsen’s diffusivity model,
larger pores are known to cause less collisions between the fluid
and pore walls, leading to higher mean free paths.30 This assists in greater interpenetration of the electrolyte
inside the catalyst material that in turn leads to a higher electrocatalytic
activity.

The ECSA, which represents the extent of catalyst
surface that
is able to take part in electrochemical reactions, is another major
parameter behind the electrocatalytic activity of a material. For
noble metals, adsorption probes are generally employed to measure
the ECSA.31,32 However, such well-characterized adsorption
probes are unavailable for most other materials. In such cases, double-layer
capacitance (DLC) measurement, which reports the amount of accumulated
charge on the electrode surface and is directly proportional to the
ECSA, is a nondestructive alternative for estimating the ECSA.32,33 To measure the ECSA of both electrocatalysts, cyclic voltammetries
(CVs) at different scan rates were recorded in the non-faradic region
in 1 M KOH. From the CV curves, the values of anodic (ia) and cathodic (iv) current
densities at 0.85 V were measured and plotted with respect to the
scan rate (as shown in Figure S3). From
these linear plots, the capacitances of NiCo2O4 and NiCo2OxS4–x were found to be 10 and 1 F/cm2, respectively.
Such a large difference in capacitance values despite the presence
of the same amount of metal centers on electrodes indicates that the
condition (1 M KOH) employed for the DLC measurement, though widely
followed, has severe limitations. Similar concerns have been raised
by Surendranath et al. in the recent past.34 They have observed that in aqueous electrolytes, ion-transfer reactions
at the electrode interface lead to additional current that convolutes
the DLC measurements, resulting in a large variability in capacitance
values, especially in the case of metal oxide and chalcogenide surfaces.
Further, they suggested that the DLC data collected in polar aprotic
electrolytes will be free from such convolution effects. In our case,
upon using a polar aprotic solvent (acetonitrile containing 0.15 M
KPF6) for DLC measurements, the specific capacitance values
for NiCo2O4 and NiCo2OxS4–x were found
to be 1.40 and 2.24 mF/cm2, respectively (as shown in Figures 4 and S4). Thus, the higher ECSA can be considered
as a primary factor behind the superior electrocatalytic activity
of NiCo2OxS4–x.

Recently, the major research focus
on metal chalcogenide and metal
phosphide electrocatalysts is toward identifying their actual catalyst
centers. It has been already pointed out by researchers that during
OER, the high oxidizing potential converts the surface of metal chalcogenides
into amorphous metal hydroxide/oxyhydroxide, which in turn acts as
the active catalyst.20,21 Thus, probing the generation
of the active catalyst on different materials may impart significant
insights into their corresponding electrocatalytic activities. Moreover,
recent theoretical calculations suggest that the metal center of an
electrocatalyst constantly switches its oxidation state during the
electrocatalytic process (as shown in Scheme 1). In this regard, CV data can be particularly
useful as they are able to provide detailed information related to
metal redox processes, active catalyst generation, and their effects
on the electrocatalytic performance.

Scheme 1 Schematic of the
Change in the Oxidation State (n) of the Metal Center
during OER
Thus, time-dependent
CV, elemental analysis, and microscopy were
carried out to probe the generation of the active catalyst layer and
its influence on the OER activity of the two electrocatalysts. For
NiCo2OxS4–x, though no significant redox activity during the
anodic sweep was observed in the first cycle recorded during precondition,
the cathodic sweep consists of a reduction peak at 1.25 V (as shown
in Figure 5). Interestingly,
an oxidation peak appeared at ∼1.6 V second cycle onward, and
its current density increased in the consecutive scans. The oxidation
peak corresponds to the oxidation of Ni2+ to Ni3+ and Co3+ to Co4+, whereas the reduction peak
can be attributed to their reduction. A large shift (∼110 mV)
of the reduction peak was noticed during precondition (consisting
of 10 cycles).

Figure 5 Precondition CV data (not iR-compensated)
of NiCo2OxS4–x recorded at 50 mV/s.

For better understanding of this phenomenon, the NiCo2OxS4–x electrode was subjected to chronoamperometry (at 1.7 V) for
24 h
and CV scans were recorded at regular intervals. As shown in Figure S5, the activity of the electrocatalyst
increased ∼38 percent in the first 30 min, and CV scan recorded
at this interval shows a huge increase for both oxidation and reduction
peak current (Figure 6). During this interval, while the reduction peak potential has shifted
from 1.28 to 1.22 V, no significant shift of the oxidation peak potential
was observed. Thereafter, the electrocatalytic performance of NiCo2OxS4–x remains stable and decreases only 4% in the next 24 h. No
major change in the CV data was also noticed except a small shift
of reduction peak from 1.22 to 1.19 V. The changes in CV response
at 10 mA/cm2 exactly follow the change in chronoamperometry
performance.

Figure 6 CV data (not iR-compensated; 10 mV/s)
of NiCo2OxS4–x recorded at different intervals during chronoamperometry.

The gradual emergence of oxidation
peak and the correlated changes
of chronoamperometry and CV data can be directly related to the generation
of the active catalyst (metal hydroxide/oxyhydroxide) layer. Such
changes can be better explained by considering the nature of the anionic
species in the electrocatalyst. Sulfur being a soft base favors metals
in their lower oxidation states and thus in the initial scans, while
the presence of a large amount of sulfur in the catalyst impedes metal
ion oxidation (as is evident from the small oxidation peak), the reduction
process starts from the very first cycle. The ability of sulfur to
reduce metal centers is already widely known.35,36 In consecutive scans, the generation of metal hydroxides makes the
metal oxidation process relatively favorable by virtue of the hardness
of oxygen, which is reflected in the increase in the anodic peak current.
However, the presence of oxygen makes the metal center reduction process
more difficult, which gets reflected in the shift of the reduction
peak toward lower potential values. Because both electrocatalytic
performance and current densities of redox peaks in CV reach their
maximum after 30 min, we may conclude that the generation of the active
catalyst layer completes in the first 30 min for NiCo2OxS4–x.
No further activation results in the near-constant nature of electrocatalytic
performance and CV data. This assumption is further supported by the
elemental analysis and microscopic data. Elemental analysis shows
that while the ratio of oxygen to sulfur has drastically changed from
8.54:47.11 to 51.65:5.99 after just 30 min of chronoamperometric treatment,
data collected after 24 h show a slight increase in oxygen content
along with a decrease in sulfur content (Tables S4 and S5). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images also
reveal that while the fresh catalyst material was crystalline in nature,
a marked decrease of crystallinity was observed on the catalyst surface
after 30 min of chronoamperometry, indicating the formation of an
amorphous metal hydroxide layer (Figure S6).

Similar time-dependent studies were performed with NiCo2O4 electrodes. In this case, the CV data show the
appearance
of oxidation and reduction peaks at 1.30 and 1.11 V, respectively,
from the very beginning (as shown in Figure 7).

Figure 7 Precondition CV data (not iR-compensated) of NiCo2O4 recorded
at 50 mV/s.

The electrocatalytic
activity of NiCo2O4 continuously
increased for the first 5 h, followed by a steady decline (as shown
in Figure S5). The CV data recorded at
different intervals provide interesting insights (Figure 8). While the reduction peak
potential remains almost unperturbed with time, the oxidation peak
continuously shifts to higher potential values. Moreover, the current
density for both oxidation and reduction peaks increases up to 5 h,
followed by a gradual decrease.

Figure 8 CV data (not iR-compensated;
10 mV/s) of NiCo2O4 recorded at different intervals
during chronoamperometry.

Such changes in current density, once correlated with SEM
images,
may explain these observations. Once subjected to OER conditions,
cracks start to appear on NiCo2O4 flakes, leading
to the availability of more number of metal centers for electrochemical
reactions (Figure S7a). However, after
5 h, the cracks become so wide that the electrocatalyst material starts
to break out of the electrode, resulting in a gradual decrease in
electrocatalytic activity (Figure S7b).
Interestingly, we have also noticed the appearance of a small amount
of black precipitate in the electrochemical cell after subjecting
NiCo2O4 electrodes to prolonged OER conditions.
It is worth mentioning at this point that the SEM images of NiCo2OxS4–x recorded after 24 h of usage do not show a similar damage
of the electrode material (Figure S7c,d). Further, this explains the saturation of electrochemical performance
after initial activation process in the case of NiCo2OxS4–x.
While the number of active sites for NiCo2O4 increases for the first few hours because of cracking of flakes,
it remains unaltered in the case of NiCo2OxS4–x.

These
results indicate that the advantages of NiCo2OxS4–x over
NiCo2O4 as the OER electrocatalyst arise from
its faster activation as well as stable performance under continuous
usage. The faster activation of NiCo2OxS4–x may be attributed to
the difference in the bond energy of metal–sulfur and metal–oxygen
bond.37 As the bond dissociation energy
of metal–sulfur is lower compared to that of metal–oxygen,
the conversion of metal sulfide into metal hydroxide/oxyhydroxide,
which is the active electrocatalyst, is relatively more facile. In
addition, the rugged nature of the NiCo2OxS4–x flake (as is evident
from SEM images) provides it the much-needed corrosion resistance
(Figure S7c,d). As a result, they show
near-constant performance for 24 h. On the contrary, the NiCo2O4 flakes are prone to cracks, which initially
provide a larger number of catalytically active sites but ultimately
lead to corrosion, resulting in a decrease in activity.

The
better activity of NiCo2OxS4–x compared to that of
NiCo2O4 is further supported by Tafel slope
values, which are 78 and 43 mV/dec for NiCo2O4 and NiCo2OxS4–x, respectively (as shown in Figure S8).

To further understand the higher electrocatalytic
activity of NiCo2OxS4–x over NiCo2O4, electrochemical
impedance
spectroscopy (EIS) of both the samples under OER condition was carried
out and the obtained data were fitted in a modified Randle’s
circuit (as shown in Figure 9). While most parameters such as solution resistance (Rs), DLC (Cdl), and
diffusion-related resistance (W) are similar, the
charge-transfer resistance (Rct), that
is, the resistance that electrons have to overcome for moving between
the reactant and the catalyst, of the two materials is significantly
different. The Rct for NiCo2OxS4–x was 23.07 Ω, whereas for NiCo2O4 it
was 38.76 Ω. A relatively lower (16.69 Ω) Rct for NiCo2OxS4–x enabled faster charge transfer
between the reactant/intermediates and the catalyst material, ultimately
leading to a higher catalytic activity compared to that of NiCo2O4. However, the observed Rct values for both electrode materials were relatively higher
than the reported values for similar materials in the literature.
We believe that the flakelike [two-dimensional (2D) structure] morphology
of both materials may be primarily responsible for such increased Rct because recent reports suggest that the charge-transfer
phenomenon is more favorable in one-dimensional (1D) structures compared
to their 2D counterparts.13,38 For example, Qu et
al. have suggested that 1D structures allow easier interpenetration
of the electrolyte, leading to the lowering of Rct.39 Further, the presence of fewer
grain boundaries in 1D materials is able to provide adequate channels
for faster charge transport compared to that in 2D materials.

of (black) NiCo2OxS4–x and (red) NiCo2O4 electrodes.
The table shows the contributions
of different parameters in the EIS study for both samples. The potentials
at which each sample shows 10 mA/cm2 activity were chosen
for performing EIS.

Recent studies on the
electrical conductivity of oxide and sulfide-based
materials indicate that sulfide-based materials are generally more
conductive compared to their oxide counterparts.40 This may be attributed to the presence of relatively more
labile d electrons in sulfur as compared to the p electrons of oxygen.
We believe that the superior conductivity of sulfides may make more
surface sites electrically accessible in NiCo2OxS4–x. This may
be one of the reasons behind the better electrocatalytic activity
of NiCo2OxS4–x compared to that of NiCo2O4.

Thereafter, theoretical calculations (DFT) were carried out
in
order to determine the electronic structure and covalency near the
Fermi level of the materials. Recent reports suggest that covalency
and the position of d-band center of the metals and p-band center
of O/S relative to the Fermi level are the strongest descriptors for
the oxygen evolution activity of a catalyst.41 However, computation of the d-band center of transition metals by
DFT often leads to a very high correlation error. Thus, we exploited
the delocalized nature of the O/S p-band to obtain a more accurate
picture of the electronic structural characteristics of catalyst materials
while still reflecting the metal d-character through hybridized density
of states. The relative position of these bands determines the hybridization
and covalent mixing between the oxygen 2p and metal 3d orbitals. To
perform theoretical calculations, some value of x for NiCo2OxS4–x is required. Because the composition of NiCo2OxS4–x was found to be Ni/Co/O/S = 1:2.1:0.6:3.29 from EDAX (as shown
in Table S2), NiCo2OS3 was taken as the model for theoretical calculations. As shown in Figure 10, the p-band center
of NiCo2OS3 is higher than that of NiCo2O4. Further, computation of d-band centers of the
transition metal shows that the d-band center of NiCo2OS3 is higher than that of NiCo2O4. We
believe that the uplift of the p-band center after sulfur incorporation
enhances the M-O/S hybridization, which in turn increases the catalytic
behavior. Because both covalency and position of band centers depend
on the properties of constituent elements, the theoretical calculations
also indicate that the presence of sulfur plays a crucial role behind
the higher electrocatalytic activity of NiCo2OxS4–x compared
to that of NiCo2O4.

3 Conclusions
In summary,
this article compares NiCo-based oxide and oxysulfide
materials for OER and details the advantages of using metal oxysulfides
over their oxide counterparts. We have synthesized NiCo2O4 and NiCo2OxS4–x on the FTO substrate by CBD, which
is a simple yet highly reproducible and scalable technique for the
catalyst layer deposition on the substrate. This further helps in
the comparative study as it ensures the presence of an equal number
of metal centers on substrates. In comparison to NiCo2O4, the NiCo2OxS4–x sample shows a much better electrocatalytic
activity for OER at pH 14. Moreover, NiCo2OxS4–x shows 30%
increase in electrocatalytic performance within just 30 min of usage
and is able to retain this activity for 24 h. In contrast, the electrocatalytic
activity of NiCo2O4 decreases about 13% after
24 h usage. The reasons behind the better electrocatalytic performance
of NiCo2OxS4–x, both in terms of activity and stability, has been
probed through time-dependent CV, microscopy, and elemental analysis.
The results indicate that the higher activity of NiCo2OxS4–x can
be attributed to its higher pore diameter, higher ECSA, lower charge
transfer resistance and lower metal–sulfur bond energy
that helps in faster activation to form active metal hydroxide/oxyhydroxide
species and rugged morphology that prevents corrosion. This work provides
significant justification of using sulfur-containing materials as
electrochemical precatalysts over their oxide counterparts for OER.

All chemicals were used without any further purification. FTO-coated
glass was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

4.2 Synthesis
4.2.1 Precursor Synthesis by CBD
The
precursor for both NiCo2O4 and NiCo2OxS4–x on FTO was synthesized by the CBD technique. Briefly, 0.5 mM Ni(NO3)3·6H2O (145.4 mg) and 1 mM Co(NO3)3·6H2O (291.04 mg) were dissolved
in 25 mL water. Subsequently, a 25 mL aqueous solution containing
2.5 mM urea (150 mg) and 1 mM NH4F (37 mg) was added to
it. The reaction mixture was stirred for 30 min and transferred to
a reagent glass bottle, which was used as the reaction vessel during
synthesis. FTO glasses were cut into 1 cm × 1 cm pieces and washed
with soap solution, distilled water, and ethanol prior to usage. Two
cleaned FTO glasses were then attached with a glass slide and kept
at an angle of 45° with the conductive side facing downward in
the same chemical bath. The bottle was tightly capped and kept undisturbed
for 48 h at ∼90 °C (as shown in Scheme S1). The temperature of the chemical bath was controlled by
an immersed temperature sensor. After completion, the reaction mixture
was allowed to cool down, and the FTO glasses were carefully rinsed
with copious amount of distilled water. On the conductive side of
the FTO glass, formation of a grayish white layer was observed. This
was used as the precursor for further synthesis of NiCo2O4 and NiCo2OxS4–x.

4.2.2 Synthesis
of NiCo2O4
The FTO glasses with precursors
formed on their conductive
side were kept in a tube furnace and were subsequently annealed at
380 °C for 2 h under atmospheric condition. The ramping rate
for attaining the desired temperature was set at 3 °C min–1. After the reaction, the grayish white layer turned
black, which was later characterized to be NiCo2O4. These material-coated FTO glasses were used as electrodes during
electrochemical measurements. Further, a similar treatment was performed
on the precipitate that had formed during CBD, and the obtained nanopowder
was subsequently used for the surface area analysis.

4.2.3 Synthesis of NiCo2OxS4–x
The FTO glasses with precursors
formed on their conductive side were
placed at the center of the annealing chamber of a tube furnace, and
about 100 mg of thiourea was placed upstream in the same chamber.
Argon was then passed for about 30 min to ensure an inert condition
inside the tube. Subsequently, the furnace was heated to 380 °C
at a ramping rate of 3 °C min–1. The reaction
was carried out for 2 h under uninterrupted Ar flow (as shown in Scheme S2). During the reaction, thiourea decomposed
and reacted with the precursor on the FTO glasses (placed downstream
wrt thiourea) to form NiCo2OxS4–x (black in color). These material-coated
FTO glasses were used as electrodes during electrochemical measurements.
Further, a similar treatment was performed on the precipitate that
had formed during CBD, and the obtained nanopowder was subsequently
used for the surface area analysis.

5 Experimental
Section
5.1 Electrochemical Measurements
All
electrochemical measurements were carried out in a three-electrode
cell comprising the materials on FTO glass substrates as the working
electrode, a Pt wire as the counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl (3.5
M KCl) as the reference electrode. A 1 (M) KOH solution was used as
the electrolyte for OER measurements. The potential scale was calibrated
to reversible hydrogen electrode and subsequently 85% iR-corrected (automatic mode) with respect to the Ohmic resistance
of the solution, unless specified. Prior to characterization, the
samples were preconditioned by CV (1–1.8 V; 10 cycles at 50
mV s–1). CV was then performed (1–1.8 V at
10 mV s–1) in order to evaluate the oxygen evolution
activity of the samples. A current density of 10 mA/cm2 was used as the benchmark to compare the activities of different
samples. EIS was carried out in the same setup within the frequency
range 100 kHz to 100 Hz at voltages corresponding to the 10 mA/cm2 current density for each sample. Chronoamperometry was performed
for 24 h in order to evaluate the stability of the catalyst layers,
and CV was obtained at different intervals during the chronoamperometric
experiment to extract information about the catalyst and its electrocatalytic
activity. To measure the ECSA, an organic electrolyte (acetonitrile
containing 0.15 M KPF6) solution was used as suggested
by Surendranath et al.34

5.2 Computational Details
The theoretical
analysis and predictions in this article were obtained with first
principle calculations based on DFT with the ultrasoft method as implemented
in the VASP package, which employs a plane-wave basis and pseudopotentials.42−45 The exchange correlation energy was treated within the generalized
gradient approximation, using the functional of Perdew, Burke, and
Ernzerhof. Two structures, (a) NiCo2O4 and (b)
NiCo2OS3, were taken under consideration to
study the effect of sulfur on the electrocatalytic activity of the
material. A 56 atom cubic supercell of eight units of inverse spinel
(Fd3m) NiCo2O4 was considered, and 24 of the 32 atoms of O were randomly substituted
by S to study NiCo2OS3. A cutoff energy of 50
Ry for truncating the kinetic energy and of 500 Ry for the representation
of charges in the plane-wave basis set was used. This was adequate
for both the structures. The structures were simulated using a (3
× 3 × 3) uniform grid of k point to sample
the 2D Brillouin zone.

5.3 Characterization Techniques
The PXRD
patterns were collected using a Rigaku-SmartLab diffractometer attached
with a D/tex ultradetector and Cu Kα source operating at 35
mA and 70 kV. The scan range was set from 20 to 70° 2θ
with a step size of 0.02° and a count time of 2 s. The samples
coated on FTO substrates were placed on a quartz slide during measurements.
Field emission SEM images and EDAX were acquired on a SUPRA 55-VP
instrument with patented GEMINI column technology. Prior to loading
the samples into the chamber, they were coated with a thin layer of
gold–palladium in order to avoid charging effects. Nitrogen
adsorption–desorption measurements were conducted at 77 K with
a Micromeritics Gemini VII-2390t instrument. The powders were outgassed
in vacuum at 150 °C for 2 h prior to measurements. All electrochemical
characterizations were carried out in a CHI electrochemical workstation
(CHI604D). TEM images were acquired on a JEM 2100F field emission
transmission electron microscope operating at 200 kV. ICP-MS was performed
in a Thermo Scientific XSERIES 2 ICP-MS instrument.
