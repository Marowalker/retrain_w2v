Traditional organic solvents used
in membrane manufacturing, such
as dimethylformamide and tetrahydrofuran, are generally very hazardous
and harmful to the environment and human health. Their total or partial
substitution with green solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is proposed
to fabricate membranes composed of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)
blended with PVDF-graft-poly(ethylene glycol) methyl
ether methacrylate (PEGMA), with the purpose to accomplish a greener
chemical process and enhance the membrane performance. Various organic
solvent compositions were first investigated using the Hansen solubility
theory, and the best mixture was thus applied experimentally. The
membrane prepared by a ratio of N,N-dimethylacetamide/DMSO = 7:3 outperformed the membranes prepared
by other solvent mixtures. This membrane showed high wetting behavior
with the water contact angle declining from 71 to 7° in 18 s
and a pure water flux reaching values larger than 700 L m–2 h–1 under 0.07 MPa applied hydraulic pressure.
The membrane rejected sodium alginate at a rate of 87%, and nearly
complete flux recovery was achieved following fouling and physical
cleaning. The introduction of green chemistry concepts to PVDF/PVDF-g-PEGMA blended membranes is a step forward in the goal
to increase the sustainability of membrane production.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Poly(vinylidene)
fluoride (PVDF) is a well-established polymeric
material to produce ultrafiltration (UF) and microfiltration (MF)
membranes owing to its exceptional mechanical properties, chemical
resistance, and thermal stability.1−7 However, despite its many advantages, the hydrophobicity of PVDF
can induce severe membrane fouling, which is a main obstacle that
limits its applications.8−12 Thanks to the compatibility of the PVDF matrix with amphiphilic
copolymers, modifications of PVDF membranes by blending with other
more hydrophilic components have been reported widely.13−17 The atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) method can be applied
to enhance the properties of polymers by grafting chains with different
characteristics, making the preparation of many new copolymers possible.18−25 Specifically, PVDF-graft-poly(ethylene glycol)
methyl ether methacrylate (PVDF-g-PEGMA) has been
successfully synthesized and characterized.20,26,27 Membranes with promising fouling resistance
behavior were thus produced by blending this PVDF-g-PEGMA material with traditional PVDF.28

Liu et al. fabricated high-performance and detect-free membranes
consisting of PVDF blended with PVDF-g-PEGMA with
a unique periodic nodular structure.28 The
membrane exhibited a high sodium alginate (SA) rejection and a very
high water permeance of 5170 L m–2 h–1 bar–1, roughly 1 magnitude higher than that obtained
by Hashim et al. or achieved by commercial membranes.29 Chen et al. further explored the formation mechanism of
the periodic nodular structure, and they found that the structure
can only be obtained when PVDF-g-PEGMA and 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone
(NMP) are deployed in the casting solution.30 Wang et al. investigated the properties of membranes fabricated
using PVDF-g-PEGMA obtained by different synthesis
reaction times and found that the membrane pore size distribution
of the final membrane is a function of this parameter.31 Wang et al. also incorporated nonwoven poly(ethylene
terephthalate) (PET) fabrics as a support layer to enhance the mechanical
properties of the fabricated PVDF blended PVDF-g-PEGMA
ultrafiltration membrane and to increase the resistance to a pressure
up to 23.3 MPa, thus satisfying the requirements for industrial applications.8

Previous studies were mainly focused on
the performance of the
blended PVDF-based membranes. There, and in the vast majority of the
membrane fabrication studies, the hazards intrinsic in the use of
the traditional solvent have been neglected. Traditional organic solvents
are toxic and hazardous. For example, dimethylformamide (DMF), a flammable
liquid, is dangerous if inhaled or exposed to skin and may cause fertility
problems. The concepts of green chemistry have been proposed for some
time and have developed rapidly.32−34 The objectives of green
chemistry are to decrease the production and use of hazardous substances
and reduce the energy consumption, moving toward renewable sources.32,34,35 Anastas and Werner proposed 12
principles of green chemistry36 with the
main goal to prevent contaminations at the very beginning of the production
stage.32,33 In the membrane manufacturing process, solvents
play a critical part in determining the properties of the membrane
by influencing the solvent–nonsolvent and solvent–polymer
interactions. Switching toward greener solvents while maintaining
or improving the membrane performance is far from a trivial task.34,37−39 Nevertheless, green solvents should be used for membrane
fabrication to reduce the impact and to facilitate the operation of
this industrial process, especially considering that the ultimate
goal of many membrane applications is precisely the removal of contaminations
from liquid streams.40,41 Solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
is a green solvent that is nontoxic and more easily recyclable compared
to traditional solvents.42−44

Based on the concept of
green chemistry and on our previous studies
on PVDF-based membranes, we optimize the fabrication of membranes
composed of PVDF blended with PVDF-g-PEGMA by substituting
traditional solvents, e.g., tetrahydrofuran (THF), DMF, and NMP, with
DMSO. The optimal partial substitution is estimated using the Hansen
solubility theory to investigate quantitatively the polymer–solvent
interaction and to ensure the compatibility between solvents and polymers.45 We thus fabricate membranes using the promising
solvent mixtures, and we evaluate the performance and the characteristics
of the membranes under ultrafiltration conditions. The goal of this
study is to fabricate a membrane with desired structural properties
and high performance in terms of both productivity and removal of
organic macromolecules using a greener synthesis route.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Chemicals and Materials
PVDF (average Mw = 534 K), PEGMA (Mn = 500 g mol–1), 4-4′-dimethyl-2-2′-dipyridyl
(DMDP, 99.5%), NMP (anhydrous, 99.5%), silicone oil, DMF (99.8%),
DMSO (99.9%), THF (≥99.9%), copper(I) chloride (CuCl, trace
metals basis, ≥99.995%), N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc, Reagent Plus, 99%), NaCl (ACS reagent,
≥99.0%), and sodium alginate (SA, Halal grade) were purchased
from MilliporeSigma (St. Louis, Missouri). Deionized water (DI water)
was produced using an ultrapure water system purchased from Ulupure
(Chengdu, China).

2.2 Procedure to Synthesize
the Graft Copolymer
PVDF-g-PEGMA
The procedure to synthesize
the PVDF-g-PEGMA copolymer was conducted as follows:28,31 5 g of PVDF was dissolved in 40 mL of NMP at 50 °C in a conical
flask while stirring. Then, 50 mL of PEGMA, 0.23 g of DMDP, and 0.04
g of CuCl were added to the same conical flask, which had already
been cooled to room temperature. Right after this addition, the reaction
mixture was stirred at 200 rpm and bubbled using nitrogen gas for
30 min. The flask was sealed using a rubber septum to prevent air
oxygen from disturbing the ATRP.24 Then,
a silicon oil bath was used to heat the conical flask to 90 °C.
The high-temperature reaction lasted for 19 h with stirring. Finally,
the resulting copolymer mixture was sealed and stored at room temperature.31

2.3 Calculation of the Hanson
Solubility Parameter
According to the Hansen solubility theory,
the affinity between
the solvent and polymer can be analyzed quantitatively. δt, the total solubility parameter, is the combination of three
parameters: δd, δh, and δp, which quantitatively represent the dispersion parameter
(δd), the hydrogen bonding parameter (δh), and the polar parameter (δp), respectively.
δd, δh, and δp can
be calculated using the following equations.46 1   2   3   4  where Fdi is the
group contribution to the dispersion component. The parameter Ehi represents the hydrogen bonding energy for
each structure group. The Fpi parameter
is the group contribution to the polar force component. For mixed
solvents, such as binary mixed solvents, δd, δh, and δp can be calculated using the volume
fraction for each solvent by applying the following equation 5  Application of the mixing law allows calculation
of the solubility parameters of mixed solvents as 6   7   8  The ternary mixed solvents
can be calculated
using the analogous methodology for three components. The affinity
between the polymer and solvents can be represented by the value of Ra, which was calculated as follows 9  The detailed calculations of the solvents
used in the experiments can be found in the Supporting Information
(SI).

2.4 Membrane
Casting
Table 1 lists the compositions of casting
solutions used for membrane synthesis in this study. All of the membranes
were synthesized at a constant room temperature of 25 °C and
∼45% humidity, controlled by an air conditioner. The casting
solutions were added to a conical flask and then heated to 60 °C
while stirring at 500 rpm. After the copolymer and PVDF powder were
dissolved completely, the solution was degassed for at least 2 h before
casting. Next, the solution was cast using an 8 in.-wide doctor blade
(Universal blade applicator, Paul N. Gardner Company, Inc., Pompano
Beach, FL) on a first-grade surface optical glass; the gate height
of the blade was set to be 200 μm. Then, the glass was immersed
in a bath that contained deionized water at room temperature (25 °C).
After 48 h, some of the cast membranes were air-dried for 24 h for
further investigation and the others were kept in DI water at 4 °C
for further experiments.

2.5 Model Foulant
The antifouling performance
of the membranes was evaluated using a model extracellular polymeric
substance, namely, sodium alginate (SA). The SA stock solution of
2 g L–1 was prepared in deionized water and stored
at 4 °C. In this experiment, the UV–vis spectrometer (Thermo
Orion Aquamate 8000) was used to determine the concentrations of SA
with a fixed wavelength of 220 nm.47,48

2.6 Membrane Characterizations
The elemental
surface composition of the membrane for a depth within 5 nm was analyzed
using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Axis Ultra, Kratos Analytical
Ltd., U.K.). The spectra with 1 eV scan resolution were obtained by
sweeping over the electron binding energy range of 0–1200 eV;
then, the atomic concentrations of the corresponding elements were
calculated from peak areas following high-resolution scans with 0.1
eV resolution. The spectra of Fourier transform infrared attenuated
total reflectance (FTIR-ATR, Alpha, Bruker) were obtained by collecting
over the 650–4000 cm–1 wavenumber range with
64 scans of 2 cm–1 resolution. The membrane morphology
was observed using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM,
JSM-7500F, JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). To observe the cross-sectional
morphology, the samples were frozen using liquid nitrogen for 3 min
before brittle fracture. The membrane samples were first fixed on
stubs using carbon tape and then sputter-coated with a gold layer
of ∼2 nm (Q150R-ES, Quorum, U.K.). The images were taken under
a 5 kV accelerating voltage with different magnifications. The thickness
of the membranes was measured using an electronic digital micrometer
(Marathon Watch Company Ltd., Canada).

The contact angles of
the blended membranes were measured using the KRÜSS DSA 25S
measuring apparatus (KRÜSS GmbH, Germany). For each measurement,
DI water droplets (2 μL) were placed on the sample surface to
obtain the dynamic variations of the contact angle for a time period
of 18 s, starting from the instant when the droplet was placed on
the sample. The experiment was repeated at different locations on
the membrane for about 10 spots. Atomic force microscopy (AFM, Multimode
8, Bruker, Germany) was used to obtain the surface roughness. In this
test, a resonant frequency of 0.997 kHz was used to scan the membranes
on 5 μm × 5 μm size areas at least 2 times. The viscosity
of the casting solutions was measured by a rotary viscometer (NDJ-79,
Changji Geological Instrument Co. Ltd., Shanghai) using 10 mL casting
solution samples at 25 °C. The mechanical properties of the fabricated
membranes were measured by an electronic single fiber strength meter
(Yuanmao Instrument Co. Ltd., Laizhou, China). This experiment was
repeated at least 10 times using samples with a length of 10 mm and
an operational speed of 10 mm min–1. The maximum
and minimum values of the tensile strength were discarded, and the
average value was then calculated. The detailed mechanical performance
of the fabricated membranes can be found in the SI.

A dead-end filtration cell (Amicon 8200, Millipore)
was used to
measure the permeability and the antifouling performance of the membranes.
The membranes were cut into circular samples with an effective area
of 28.7 cm2. The filtration cell (200 mL) was connected
to a dispensing vessel (5 L). The permeate stream was recorded every
minute. All of the experiments were performed at room temperature,
and nitrogen gas was used to maintain a constant pressure of 0.07
MPa (10 psi). For each pure water filtration or antifouling experiment,
the duration of the flux measurement was the lesser one between a
predetermined time or the time needed to filter 4 L of feed water.
First, the membrane sample was compacted using 4 L of water for 2
h, while the flux of permeate water was recorded as Jw1 (L m–2 h–1). Second,
a conditioning period of the membrane followed using 4 L of NaCl solution
of 10 mM L–1 as a feed for 2 h. Third, the model
fouling test was conducted using 4 L of feed solution that contained
20 mg L–1 SA and 10 mmol L–1 NaCl
for 5 h. During the fouling test, the concentration polarization was
minimized using a stirring plate (PC-420D, Corning) adjusted to 200
rpm, on which the filtration cell was placed. The flux was recorded
as Jp (L m–2 h–1). Finally, the membrane was physically cleaned using a constant
DI water flow of 2.7 L min–1 for 1 min, maintaining
the water surface 25 cm above the membrane surface. After cleaning,
the recovery flux, Jw2 (L m–2 h–1), was measured using water as feed solution
for 1 h. The flux recovery ratio (FRR), total flux decline ratio (DRt), reversible flux decline ratio (DRr), and irreversible
flux decline ratio (DRir) were calculated by the following
equations using an average value from three tests.18,49,50 10   11   12   13  

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Elemental Composition of
the Membranes
XPS results of all of the PVDF/PVDF-g-PEGMA membranes
are displayed in Figure 1. The membrane was synthesized using a PVDF/PVDF-g-PEGMA mixture dissolved in different organic solvents or solvent
mixtures. The composition percentage of the three main elements was
within a small range, with oxygen ∼12.6%, carbon ∼61.4%,
and fluorine ∼25.5%. Because the organic solvents and the unreacted
PEGMA diffused out from the polymer film and into water during phase
separation, the only source of oxygen in the samples was the PEGMA
segments in the PVDF-g-PEGMA chains. The appearance
of oxygen in the spectra, besides carbon and fluorine, reflects that
the amphiphilic PEGMA segments in the PVDF-g-PEGMA
migrated preferentially to the membrane surface, indicating the successful
blending of PVDF-g-PEGMA with PVDF in different casting
solutions.31 As listed in Table 2, compared with other membranes
cast previously from PVDF blended with PVDF-g-PEGMA,
the content of carbon and oxygen was higher, while that of fluorine
was lower.8,28,30,31 This observation is explained with the smaller proportion
of PVDF in the blend and the larger amount of PEGMA segments that
migrated to the membrane surface. The viscosity might be an important
factor affecting the migration of PEGMA segments to the membrane surface
in this study.31 A lower viscosity weakened
the exchange barrier between the nonsolvent and solvent, which accelerated
the phase inversion. Therefore, the migration of PEGMA segments to
the membrane surface could be more effective. The existence of more
PEGMA segments may improve some properties of the membranes. For example,
it may decrease the surface tension and polarity to increase the hydrophilicity
of the membrane; thus, potentially, the antifouling property of the
membrane increased.

and reported in the graphs.

3.2 ATR-FTIR Spectra
Figure 2 shows the
ATR-FTIR spectra
of PVDF/PVDF-g-PEGMA membranes. The 1727 cm–1 band represents the C=O stretching band, while the 1638 cm–1 band represents the C=C stretching band.17,30,51 The existence of C=O bonds
indicates that the PEGMA segments were present in all of the membrane
surfaces, while the absence of C=C implies that the unreacted
PEGMA was removed during phase separation by diffusing out into the
coagulation bath. This result suggests that PEGMA was successfully
grafted onto PVDF because the synthesized PVDF-g-PEGMA
contains only C=O bonds and no C=C bonds.

Figure 2 ATR-FTIR spectra
of the PVDF/PVDF-g-PEGMA membranes
cast using different solvents or solvent mixtures. PVDF1, DMSO; PVDF2,
DMSO/DMAc = 3:7, PVDF3, DMSO/ NMP = 5:5; and PVDF4, DMSO/THF/DMF =
5:1.5:3.5. The 1727 cm−1 peak represents C=O
bonds, and the 1638 cm−1 peak represents C=C
bonds. Also indicated are the peaks relative to the characteristic
bonds that represent the PVDF α and β crystalline phases.

The results from ATR-FTIR measurements can also
be used to confirm
the crystalline phase of the membrane. The mechanical strength properties
of the membranes can be influenced by its crystalline phase.37,52 The characteristic absorption bands at 410, 531, 615, 764, 796,
855, and 976 cm–1 represent the α crystalline
phase, while the β phase is identified by the bands at 442,
468, 510, and 840 cm–1.1,52−55 As shown in Figure 2, the γ-phase characteristic peaks at 776, 812, and 833 cm–1 were not observed for the samples prepared in this
study,52,54 while all of the membranes contained α
and β PVDF crystalline phases. The 765 cm–1 band of PVDF2 and PVDF3 was more obvious than that of PVDF1 and
PVDF4 membranes. The formation of α and β phases may be
influenced by the temperature.54 The α
phase resulting from melting crystallization can be easily obtained
at any temperature, while the 840 cm–1 band is common
for both β
and γ phases; when the temperature of solution crystallization
is under 70 °C, the polymer solidification results in the β
phase rather than the γ phase.54

3.3 Membrane Morphology
Micrographs of
surface and cross-sectional morphologies were acquired using SEM,
and representative images are shown in Figure 3. Using DMSO only as a solvent resulted in
a surface with large pore sizes and irregular pore distribution. Therefore,
total substitution of traditional solvents with DMSO was not a successful
attempt, which may lead to defects on the membrane surface. After
mixing DMSO with a certain percentage of traditional solvents, the
pore size significantly decreased. Table 3 lists the main structural parameters of
the fabricated membranes. PVDF/PVDF-g-PEGMA membranes
synthesized in previous studies had pore size parameters, Davg and Dmax, of
about 34 and 126 nm when using DMF/THF as the solvent mixture and
42 and 146 nm when using NMP as the solvent (Table 2).28,30,31 In this study, the partial substitution of NMP and DMF/THF using
DMSO translated in a significant pore shrinkage such that the pores
could not be observed under 10k× or 100k× magnification
on the surface of PVDF3 and PVDF4 membranes.28 Relative to the cross-sectional morphologies, a top dense layer
and an asymmetric structure were observed in all of the PVDF/PVDF-g-PEGMA membranes, with underlying porous fingerlike structures
(PVDF1, PVDF3, and PVDF4) or macrovoids (PVDF2). The thickness of
the membranes largely decreased when compared to that of PVDF/PVDF-g-PEGMA membranes synthesized in previous studies (Table 2), which was mainly
due to the lower percentage of PVDF-g-PEGMA and PVDF
in the casting solution. This mechanism led to a clear decrease in
the mechanical strength, which was observed while handling the samples.
The cross-sectional morphologies and the pore size distribution influence
pure water flux, fouling, and flux recovery performance of the membrane,37 which are discussed below.

surface images are shown in the top row, while the cross-sectional
morphologies are shown in the bottom row.

3.4 Wettability
The
wettability of the
PVDF/PVDF-g-PEGMA membranes was estimated through
sessile drop contact angle measurements. The results are reported
in Figure 4. The initial
contact angles were in the same range 65–70° as our previous
study, whose results are reported in Table 2. However, the changes in the contact angle
of our previous membranes were small (less than 10°) in 3 min.
In contrast, for the membranes fabricated in this study, the contact
angle reduction as a function of time was significant, especially
for PVDF2. Specifically, the contact angles decreased from 63.8 ±
2.5 to 46.1 ± 4.9° in 18 s for PVDF1, from 70.8 ± 3.8
to 7.4 ± 1.4° for PVDF2, from 69.7 ± 3.9 to 49.9 ±
4.0° for PVDF3, and from 61.0 ± 2.5 to 45.3 ± 4.9°
for PVDF4, which indicated that the wettability of PVDF/PVDF-g-PEGMA membranes was significantly enhanced.56

PVDF1,
DMSO; PVDF2, DMSO/DMAc = 7:3, PVDF3, DMSO/NMP = 5:5; and PVDF4, DMSO/THF/DMF
= 5:1.5:3.5.

Many factors contribute to the
wettability of the membrane, including
the hydrophilic segments distribution, the surface roughness, and
the surface pore size.10 It has been reported
that the air bubble/water droplet contact angle can be significantly
affected by the surface roughness and solid surface heterogeneity.57−59 According to the Wenzel model, a large quantity of surface amphiphilic
or hydrophilic segments and a larger surface roughness will make the
surface more hydrophilic. In this study, the enhancement in wettability
is mainly attributed to the migration of a larger amount of PEGMA
segments to the membrane surface, as well to the membrane morphology.
In particular, the cross-sectional morphology observed for PVDF2 allowed
faster spreading of water on this membrane. Wettability is important
and may also enhance the antifouling properties of the membranes.

3.5 Surface Roughness
Representative
AFM images of the fabricated PVDF/PVDF-g-PEGMA ultrafiltration
membranes can be found in the SI (Figure S1), and their root mean square (RMS) surface roughness are shown in Table 3. The absolute RMS
was within 60 nm. This value is larger than that of membranes fabricated
in previous studies, which was about 15–30 nm. The reason is
that the migration of PVDF-g-PEGMA segments to the
surface can result in a larger RMS surface roughness, which is in
accordance with the results reported by Liu et al. and Wang et al.28,31 When using DMSO alone, the RMS roughness of the membrane was slightly
lower than that of membranes fabricated by mixing traditional solvents
with DMSO, showing that the solvent can also influence the membrane
roughness. Usually, lower roughness translates into easier membrane
cleaning and better antifouling properties.60

3.6 Membrane Transport and Antifouling Performance
The permeate flux of PVDF/PVDF-g-PEGMA membranes
was recorded under a 0.07 MPa (10 psi) constant applied pressure. Figure 5 summarizes the flux
profiles, the rejection rates of sodium alginate, and the fouling
indices. The pure water permeabilities for PVDF1–PVDF4 were
214 ± 8 L, 735 ± 74, 460 ± 27, and 532 ± 16 L
m–2 h–1 bar–1, respectively. All of the membranes exhibited a sharp decline in
flux during the filtration of an SA solution, with the flux reaching
a near steady-state value of approximately 100 L m–2 h–1. After physical cleaning for 1 min using pure
water, the order of recovery fluxes for the four membranes was PVDF2
> PVDF3 > PVDF4 >PVDF1, which was similar to the order of
highest
to lowest water permeability. The different solvent or solvent mixture
used in the casting dope had clearly a significant impact on flux,
with variations above 300% for the membranes. Partial DMSO substitution
achieved better results, with PVDF2 performing best possibly due to
its better wettability and cross-sectional structure.

water or sodium alginate as feed solution; B) FRR, DRt,
DRr, and DRir indices; and (C) SA rejection.

SA rejection rates are reported in Figure 5C. The size of the SA particle
in the experiments
was in the range of 15–80 nm; thus, SA particles can easily
pass through the surface pores of PVDF1, leading to a low rejection
rate. PVDF2 performed best, suggesting that wettability influenced
the rejection and antifouling performance more than the surface pore
size. Compared with membranes fabricated previously (Table 2), using DMSO decreased the
SA rejection, which however was higher than 80% for the best membranes.
The FRR, DRt, DRr, and DRir values
of all PVDF/PVDF-g-PEGMA membranes are summarized
in Figure 5B. High
DRr/DRt and FRR indices are indicative of better
antifouling properties, i.e., fouling reversibility, of the fabricated
membranes.61 The order of FRR and DRr/DRt ratios was PVDF3 ∼ PVDF2 > PVDF4
≫
PVDF1. Therefore, applying a partial substitution with green solvent
DMSO produced an outstanding flux recovery rate in two cases. Despite
the larger roughness of the membranes, the wettability, foulant rejection,
and flux recovery ratios were beyond expectation. Therefore, we can
conclude that hydrophilic segments on the surface of the membrane
contribute more than the roughness to the fouling behavior of the
membrane. In summary, performance of PVDF2 was outstanding, while
the performance of PVDF1 was not satisfying, indicating that DMSO
alone is not a good solvent for PVDF/PVDF-g-PEGMA
fabrication under the tested conditions. However, using DMSO to partly
substitute hazardous traditional solvents is a promising way to achieve
a cleaner process as well as high-performance membranes.

4 Conclusions
Based on the calculation using the Hanson
solubility theory, the
total and partial substitution of hazardous traditional solvents with
green solvent DMSO were investigated for the fabrication of PVDF membranes
blended with PVDF-g-PEGMA. The total and partial
substitution with DMSO generally improved the wettability and the
fouling performance of the ultrafiltration membranes. Specifically,
the membranes fabricated via partial substitution (PVDF2, 3, 4) performed
better than the membrane fabricated from polymer solution of pure
DMSO (PVDF1). The best performing membrane was cast from a solution
containing DMAc and DMSO. This membrane had simultaneously high permeability
of above 700 L m–2 h–1 bar–1, high alginate rejection (87%), and showed remarkable
antifouling performance with flux recovery rates of nearly 100%. According
to the results of these experiments, the partial substitution of traditional
organic solvents using green solvent DMSO to synthesize ultrafiltration
membranes consisting of PVDF blended with PVDF-g-PEGMA
can achieve a greener chemical process while also significantly enhancing
the membrane performance.
