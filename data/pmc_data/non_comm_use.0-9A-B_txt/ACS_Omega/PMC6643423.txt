Surfactant-mediated
coacervates are termed as the new age microreactors
for their ability to spontaneously sequester the molecules with varied
polarities and functionalities. Efforts to emulate this applicability
of coacervates through synthetic control of surfactant structures
are finding success; however, there is little understanding of how
to translate these changes into tailor-made properties. Herein, we
designed 3-methyl-1-(octyloxycarbonylmethyl)imidazolium bromide (C8EMeImBr), an ester-functionalized ionic liquid-based surfactant,
which shows better surface active properties than the nonfunctionalized
and conventional cationic surfactant and forms complex coacervates
over the broad range of concentration with sodium salicylate (NaSal).
Mono- and divalent cations as well as ionic strength, viscosity, and
time-dependent stability of the coacervates had also been addressed
in order to study whether these coacervates could work as microreactors
to encapsulate various molecules. The anionic charged complex coacervates
with sponge morphology and honey comb-like interior show good efficiency
to sequester cationic dyes from water because of electrostatic and
hydrophobic interactions and good encapsulation efficiency for curcumin
owing to their high surface area. Results suggest that ionic liquid-based
coacervates studied here could be exploited as a novel low-cost, effective,
and environmentally benign alternative to sequester dyes from the
contaminated water and their recovery.

1 Introduction
Synergistic
interactions between the oppositely charged surfactants
or ionic surfactants with inorganic and organic electrolytes lead
to the formation of various morphological architectures, both in their
pure state and in the presence of various external additives.1,2 The shape and size of these morphological architectures depend on
the (i) structural architecture of the individual components of the
mixture, (ii) composition of the mixture, and (iii) various solution
conditions including pH, temperature, and ionic strength of the solution.1,2 Judiciously selecting any of these conditions separately or in a
group could be advantageous in designing aggregates with varied shapes
and sizes including various cell mimetic structures such as vesicles,
hydrogels, and coacervates.1,2 Among these, coacervates,
the new age microreactors, are formed as a result of the subtle balance
between a range of interactions in the solutions, that is, the electrostatic,
hydrophobic, hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces, and other weak
interactions.3 The ability to preconcentrate
various solubizates including dyes, drugs, metal ions, and biomolecules
with adjustable sequestering ability makes coacervates low-cost membrane-free
microreactors or cell mimetic systems (for biomolecules).4,5

Various traditional surfactant systems including nonionic
and ionic
surfactants form coacervates in their pure form (simple coacervates)
as well as in the presence of various external additives (complex
coacervates).6−11 Among these, nonionic surfactant-based coacervates were used to
sequester the organic compounds through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic
interactions.6,7 The efficiency of these coacervates
could be enhanced through increasing the hydrophobic character of
the nonionic surfactant. It was reported that the preconcentration
factor of the nonionic/ionic surfactant mixture is higher than that
of the neat nonionic surfactant.8 This
could improve the sequestration ability of the coacervates for the
charged organic solutes. Compared to the nonionic surfactant-based
coacervates, ionic surfactant-based coacervates provide more binding
sites to the analysts as the formation of coacervates are controlled
by electrostatic and cation−π interactions apart from
the hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions.9 These interactions, and as a result coacervation,
could be tailor-made using hydrotopes in the surfactant-based coacervation
system.10 The catanionic mixture thus formed
exhibits superior sequestration ability because of their better surface
activity, lower critical micelle concentration (cmc), and then the
individual components of the mixture. Various analysts could be sequestered
within these complex coacervate systems including dyes, drugs, and
biomolecules. Sequestration of dyes within the coacervate systems
is based on the charge on the coacervates.11−13 Reversible
compartmentalization of biomolecules had been achieved through the
complex coacervation composed of RNAs with cationic peptides.14 Chiappisi et al. demonstrated the sequestration
of Sudan red dye within the coacervates formed through the interaction
of oppositely charged chitosan and alkylethoxy carboxylate.11,12 Orange OT was sequestered by the coacervates formed through interacting
poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) with the SDS/Triton-X 100 mixture.13 Looking at abovementioned characteristics of
ionic surfactant-based coacervates, it is manifested that one can
enhance the sequestration ability of the ionic surfactant coacervates
by changing their structure.

Recently, ionic liquids (ILs) are
studied for their superior interfacial
and micellar properties than the conventional surfactants and are
also termed as surface-active ILs or IL-based surfactants (ILBSs).15−17 Ning et al. studied the IL-based coacervates as an adsorbent for
the extraction of malachite green, crystal violet (CV), and methylene
blue dyes.18 We are engaged in studying
interfacial and micellar properties of the traditional surfactants
as well as ILBSs with nonfunctionality in their neat form and through
various external additives.19,20 Studies pertaining
to ILBSs with additional functionality are as yet limited, and it
is part of our recent and future research endeavor. Introducing functionality
makes these novel amphiphiles more task-specific. For example, replacing
the methyl group with −CH2COOH or introducing the
vinyl functionality within the head group of the ILBSs improves the
surface activity of the latter.21,22 The impact of the functionality
is not limited to only surface activity. The “green credentials”
of the ILBSs can also be improved. For example, the toxicity of the
ILs can be reduced by incorporating the ether functionality in the
side chain of the imidazolium-based ILs.23 Ester functionality significantly improved the surface and biological
activity as well as the biodegradability of the imidazolium- and pyridinium-based
ILs.24

In a quest to design cost-effective,
more efficient, and environmentally
benign system to sequester various functional molecules, herein, we
design the complex coacervate-based microreactors through the catanionic
approach. The catanionic complex coacervates were designed through
interacting ILBS, 3-methyl-1-(octyloxycarbonylmethyl) imidazolium
bromide (C8EMeImBr), and sodium salicylate, NaSal, over
a broad range of composition. The structure of C8EMeImBr
and NaSal is given in Scheme 1. The stability of the complex coacervates had also been studied
in the presence of mono- and divalent cations as well as various solution
conditions such as time, ionic strength, and viscosity. These membrane-free
microreactors with anionic charge spontaneously sequester cationic
dyes owing to the electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions and encapsulate
curcumin because of the larger surface area.

(C8EMeImBr) and (b) Sodium Salicylate (NaSal)
2 Results
and Discussion
A subtle balance of interactions such as electrostatic,
hydrophobic,
hydrogen bonding, cation−π, and π–π
interactions between the oppositely charged substrate (anionic Sal)
and micellar aggregate of C8EMeImBr leads to the formation
of a complex coacervates phase and dilute aqueous phase of C8EMeImBr.3 The complex coacervate phase
was obtained at the range of mixture composition, that is, at a fixed
concentration of C8EMeImBr (112.5 mM) and at a range of
NaSal concentration (100–400 mM). The phase behavior of the
mixture was studied through combining the turbidity data and visual
observation data. We used physical, spectroscopic, and microscopic
methods to detect the morphological changes in the mixture as a function
of increasing concentration of NaSal. cmc of C8EMeImBr
measured through surface tension is 45 mM, which was then compared
with the traditional surfactant and nonfunctionalized ILBS with analogous
alkyl chain length. All measurements were performed on the micellar
solutions of C8EMeImBr. The complex coacervates were used
to sequester dyes [Methyl Orange (MO), Allura Red (AR), CV, and rhodamine
B (RB)] and to encapsulate curcumin.

2.1 Adsorption
of C8EMeImBr at the
Solution/Air Interface
Figure 1 depicts the surface tension plot of the C8EMeImBr solution along with the nonfunctionalized ILBS, 3-methyl-1-octylimidazolium
bromide (C8MeImBr), and conventional surfactant, and octyltrimethyl
ammonium bromide (C8TABr), with an identical alkyl chain
length (n = 8) in aqueous medium as a function of
logarithmic concentration of amphiphiles at 25 °C. As reported,
with the increasing concentration of C8EMeImBr, the adsorption
of C8EMeImBr on the air/water interface increases which
decreases the surface tension. At a certain concentration, surface
tension attains a minimum value before micellization. Traditional
ionic and nonionic surfactants as well as functionalized and nonfunctionalized
ILBS with surface active impurities show similar surface tension behavior.24,25 We performed several purification steps to remove this, but no significant
change in the surface tension results was observed. Formation of micelles
and the surface monolayer before micellization might be the cause
for this surface tension minimum.25 Herein,
we assigned the concentration associated with this surface tension
minimum as the cmc of C8EMeImBr, which is in good agreement
with the reported literature.24 cmc values
for C8EMeImBr, nonfunctionalized (C8MeImBr),
and conventional cationic surfactants (C8TABr) are in order:
C8EMeImBr (45 mM) < C8MeImBr (170 mM) <
C8TABr (261 mM).24−27 The lower cmc of the ester-functionalized ILBS is
due to the (i) hydration of the ester group within the head group,
which decreases the repulsion of the head groups at the air–water
interface and (ii) the intramolecular hydrogen bonding within the
head groups, which is favored by the close proximity of the ester
group to the imidazolium ring.

concentration curve of
C8EMeImBr (■), C8MeImBr (blue triangle),
and C8TABr (red circle) curves at 25 °C in aqueous
medium.

The comparison of data pertaining
to surface tension at cmc (γcmc), the effectiveness
of surface tension reduction (πcmc), the maximum
surface excess concentration (Γmax), the minimum
area occupied per amphiphilic molecule (Amin) at the solution/air interface for C8EMeImBr, C8MeImBr, and C8TABr in aqueous
medium are reported in Table 1. γcmc for C8EMeImBr is lower
than that of C8MeImBr and C8TABr, that is, introducing
the functionality increases the efficiency of the ILs to reduce the
surface tension of water. The surface pressure at the cmc (πcmc) for the studied ester-functionalized ILBS, C8EMeImBr, is higher than that of the conventional and nonfunctionalized
ILBS, that is, C8TABr and C8MeImBr, respectively.
The higher values of Γmax for the ester-functionalized
ILBSs than the C8MeImBr and C8TABr indicate
that ester-functionalized ILBSs accumulate in greater amount at the
air/water interface than others. Amin calculated
for C8EMeImBr is lower than the nonfunctionalized and −COOH-functionalized
ILBS as well as for C8TABr.28−30 This concludes that
C8EMeImBr forms more compact structures on the surface
than the nonfunctionalized and −COOH-functionalized ILBS as
well as the traditional surfactant.

The geometry and size of the aggregates influence
the applications
of the amphiphiles. We employed the well-known Israelachvilís
ratio to predict the shape of the aggregates for C8EMeImBr.31 Combining the experimentally determined values
of Amin and using the Tanford formula,32 we calculated the packing parameter (P); which was less than 0.33, indicating that the aggregates
for C8EMeImBr are spherical in shape near its cmc.24 The size and shape of the aggregates could be
modulated through interaction of the amphiphiles with various external
additives. Among these, hydrotropes are well known as they are structurally
similar to surfactants except the alkyl chain. They interact electrostatically
as well as hydrophobically with the ionic surfactants, leading to
the change in the shape and size of the micellar aggregates. Among
the range of hydrotopes, sodium salicylate, because of its well-established
surface activity and self-aggregation behavior, is tested in the present
study to change the shape and size of the micellar aggregates of the
aqueous solution of C8EMeImBr.

In our earlier publication,
we had reported the transition of spherical
micellar aggregates of the nonfunctionalized ILBSs into the vesicles
through addition of the external additives including NaSal.35,36 For NaSal as the additive, several authors have reported the formation
of rodlike micelles, wormlike micelles, vesicles, and hydrogels near
the equimolar concentration for the traditional cationic surfactants
and for ILBSs. We represented these comparison data in Table SI-1
in the Supporting Information. For the
first time, in the present investigation, we observed the formation
of complex coacervates near the charge neutralization concentration,
that is, at equimolar concentration. The coacervate droplets formed
are separated from the aqueous solution of C8EMeImBr and
are observed at the upper side of the sample tube. The phase behavior
of the aqueous C8EMeImBr solution in the presence of various
concentrations of NaSal is explained herewith in detail through visual
observation and turbidity measurement.

As reported in Figure 2, turbidity of the
mixture increases upto a certain concentration,
stays practically constant, and then decreases. To understand the
effect of NaSal concentration on the shape and size of the micellar
aggregates of C8EMeImBr, we divided the turbidity behavior
in four portions, A1, A2, A3, and
A4 based on the concentration of NaSal. With the increasing
concentration of NaSal, pH of the neat micellar solutions of C8EMeImBr changes from 2.61 to 7.41 for the addition of 1000
mM of NaSal. The pKa of NaSal in water
is 2.79, that is, NaSal is present as (Sal–) under
our experimental conditions (pH of solution with 2 mM NaSal was 2.84).
We can safely assume that the micellar changes occurred in the solution
are due to the electrostatic interactions between the cationic micelle
and the anionic Sal–, as indicated for the drug-induced
micellar transition in the ILBS solution and other catanionic systems.10,35,36 Region A1 belongs
to the concentration (CNaSal < 10 mM)
where transparent solution with nearly zero turbidity was observed
(Figure 2). This indicates
the weaker interaction between NaSal and C8EMeImBr that
forms only smaller-sized aggregates. Beyond A1, with the
increasing concentration of NaSal, turbidity increases may be due
to the increased size of the aggregates because of the stronger electrostatic
and hydrophobic interaction with the increased number of NaSal in
solution. Electrostatic interactions between [C8EMeIm]+ with the carboxylate anion of the NaSal and hydrophobic interactions
between the alkyl chain of C8EMeImBr and the aromatic group
of NaSal increased the packing and eventually the size of the aggregates.
With further increase in CNaSal, in the
A3 region, the turbidity sharply increases to a very large
value (the data in the A3 region of Figure 2 are obtained through diluting the coacervate
phase 10 times with water) and formation of droplets occurs that are
phase-separated from the aqueous C8EMeImBr solution with
time. This may be due to the association of the C8EMeImBr/NaSal
aggregates, which leads to the formation of liquid–liquid phase
separation. The complex coacervate droplets were observed between
100 and 400 mM concentrations of NaSal. Beyond the A3 region,
turbidity decreases with the formation of clear solution. This may
be due to the formation of catanionic complexes which is due to the
dissolution of coacervates into excess NaSal. The coacervation region
was observed around the charge neutralization point between cationic
C8EMeImBr and anionic NaSal, as evidenced through the zeta
potential results (Table 2). Zeta potential results indicate that the charge on the
coacervate droplets depends on the concentration of NaSal. Our results
are in accordance to the results reported by Douliez et al., where
the authors have reported the catanionic droplets with positive and
negative charge based on the ratio of cetylpyridinium chloride to
decanoic acid for different amounts of NaOH.37 Further, as reported in Table SI-2, for
conventional and ILBS systems, only the aggregates that are rodlike
and wormlike with vesicles and hydrogels are reported.10 Reports pertaining to the formation of complex
coacervates in the ILBS system are not yet reported as per our knowledge.

Colloidal solution in region A3 separates into two equilibrium
phases with time: a viscous coacervate phase rich in the colloidal
material and a low viscous aqueous phase with lower concentration
of the colloidal material. The down coacervate phase is colorless
and isotropic and has higher viscosity, which is consistent with the
matrix of elongated micelles.38 Thus, the
one with up to 95% water and the other with 99–100% water do
not freely mix with each other.38 We perform
dynamic light scattering (DLS), optical microscopy, and field emission
scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) measurements to deduce the size
and morphology of the complex coacervate droplets. The polydisperse
suspension of the spherical droplets is of the size 100–500
μm as measured through DLS while mixing C8EMeImBr
(112.5 mM) and NaSal (100–400 mM) in water and is evidenced
through optical microscopy (Figure 3). With the increasing concentration of NaSal, the
size decreases. At 200 mM concentration of NaSal, yolk–shell
type particles may be composed of shells (hollow spherical particles)
with a smaller yolk (solid sphere) in their interior (Figure 3b). The complex coacervates
prepared through mixing 112.5 mM of C8EMeImBr and 200 mM
of NaSal were further visualized using epifluorescence images (Figure 4a), where the coacervate
droplets were labeled using rhodamine 6G. The concentration of the
dye was taken very low in order to minimize the dye–coacervate
interaction. The morphology of these “yolk–shell”
particles visible in Figures 3b and 4a was further analyzed using
FESEM and found that these complex coacervate phases have “sponge”
morphology (Figure 4b). The three-dimensional structure of the coacervate droplet is
visible at 4950 instrument magnification with the honey comb-like
interior, with 2.67–7.22 μm pores. Menger et al. reported
a similar sponge morphology for simple coacervates prepared from the
aqueous zwitterionic gemini surfactants.39 The morphology as well as the interior structure could be applicable
in various technological applications including encapsulating various
substrates.

The subtle balance of interactions responsible for the formation
of complex coacervates within the catanionic system composed of NaSal–/C8EMeImBr is characterized through measuring
the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum of the partially dried
coacervate samples and was compared with neat C8EMeImBr. Figure 5 shows the changes
in the methylene peaks in the infrared absorption peaks for neat C8EMeImBr and coacervate samples. As observed in Figure 5, the asymmetric and symmetric
stretching vibrations of −CH2 groups are shifted
to higher wave numbers, that is, from 2922 and 2854 cm–1 to 2928 and 2859, respectively, as compared to the neat C8EMeImBr. The change in this region corresponds to the gauche/trans
conformations. The shift of frequency toward a lower value corresponds
to the ordered trans conformation, whereas the shift of frequency
toward a higher value corresponds to the disordered gauche conformation.
In the present investigation, the shift of frequency toward higher
wavenumber suggests that the methylene chain observes gauche conformation
in the coacervate phase because of the increased hydrophobic interactions
between the alkyl chain of C8EMeImBr and the aromatic group
of NaSal.

The C–N stretching vibration
(asymmetric and symmetric)
in the cationic ring, which is located at 1470 and 1462 cm–1 in powder C8EMeImBr is shifted to 1479 and 1456 cm–1 for the coacervates. Further, −C–O
stretching vibration located at 1180 cm–1 in the
pure C8EMeImBr is shifted to 1168 cm–1. This indicates the strong electrostatic interaction between Sal– and C8EMeIm+.40 Further, the ester group absorption peak which is at 1747
cm–1 for the pure C8EMeImBr is shifted
to 1741 cm–1 for the coacervates, that is, the ester
group is likely to be more hydrated in the coacervates that are formed
at higher concentrations of NaSal.40

2.2 Stability Study of Complex Coacervates
In order to serve the complex coacervates formed here as the microreactors,
we analyzed the stability of the studied complex coacervates in various
solution conditions, such as spontaneity of formation, ionic strength,
and viscosity of the solution, and in the presence of mono and divalent
cations.41−43 As shown in Figure 3, the droplet size of the complex coacervates varied
from 100 to 500 nm through varying the concentration of NaSal from
100 to 400 mM. At 100 mM concentrations of NaSal, coacervates are
positively charged (zeta potential data, Table 2, vide supra) and are formed by the subtle
balance of electrostatic interactions between Sal– and C8EMeIm+ and hydrophobic interactions
between the aromatic part of NaSal and alkyl chain of the C8EMeImBr. The size of the droplets is bigger at this concentration
of NaSal because of the relatively same number of cations and anions
in the solution. Therefore, at 100 mM concentration of NaSal, coacervation
takes place spontaneously and the size of the coacervate droplets
is bigger. However, with increasing the concentration of NaSal beyond
112.5 mM, the excess salt present in the solution dissolves the catanionic
complex coacervates and disfavors the coacervation, which decreases
the size of coacervate droplets. Thus, ionic strength is an important
factor for the coacervate morphology as it helps in molecular rearrangement
and by that means the coacervation.42,43

The
coacervate droplets that are formed spontaneously coalesced into a
2.5 mL layer, that is separated from the aqueous layer on resting.
Spontaneously formed coacervate droplets are measured under optical
microscopy with respect to resting time. Optical micrographs of the
coacervate droplets formed through C8EMeImBr (112.5 mM)
and NaSal (300 mM) show that with increasing time from 0 to 15 min,
the droplets coagulate with each other and form bigger-sized droplets
(Figure 6). After 15
min, no more coagulation takes place, and the size of the droplets
remains intact.37

Figure 6 Optical microscopy images
of the complex coacervates with C8EMeImBr (112.5 mM) and
NaSal (300 mM) as a function of time
(a) 0, (b) 5, and (c) 10 min. (Scale bar = 500 μm).

The effect of mono- and divalent cations on the
stability of the
complex coacervates was investigated through the addition of increasing
concentration of NaCl, MgCl2, and CaCl2. Solution
of NaCl could employ the osmotic pressure across the cell membranes,
causing them to burst in their early stage of evolution. We observe
that the coacervates were stable in the presence of 400 mM concentration
of NaCl. Insensitivity to NaCl by the complex coacervates is likely
attributable to the catanionic nature and the stronger counterion
binding of Sal– with C8EMeIm+ where associations with external monovalent ions are negligible.
The divalent salts, for example, MgCl2 and CaCl2, have the ability to disassemble the fatty acid and amphiphilic
compounds, the constituents of the cell membrane, into the crystalline
salts. We observe that upto 100 mM concentration of MgCl2, the coacervates are stable, whereas coacervates became destabilized
to produce a crystalline salt upon addition of only 100 mM of CaCl2 (Figure SI-1).37,44

The droplet size was controlled according to change in internal
viscosity of the solution. Higher viscous solution favors smaller-sized
droplets, whereas lower viscous solution favors bigger-sized coacervate
droplets. We inhibited coalescence of the coacervates to produce stabilized
coacervate droplets by increasing the internal viscosity through incorporating
0.15 w/v % solution of sodium alginate (NaAlg). No phase separation
was observed after 1 week, and the mean size of the droplets also
remained intact (Figure SI-2).42,44 This indicates that incorporating NaAlg within the C8EMeImBr/NaSal droplets effectively stabilizes the coacervates.

2.3 Application of the Coacervates in Dye Sequestration
and Curcumin Encapsulation
Textile dyes with thermal and
light stability are the major pollutants in water resources and are
of prime concern. Further, chromophoric and fluorophoric dyes are
used to probe the microenvironment of micellar assemblies and to deduce
the shape and size of the aggregates.45,46 Several strategies
have been adopted to either remove or preconcentrate these dyes from
the aqueous solution.47 Coacervation-based
absorbents have been widely used in medicine, food science, and cosmetics
as microreactors.47,48 Major advantages of coacervation
are their ability to perform encapsulation in a purely aqueous medium
and the potential for dramatically enriching the desired molecules
in the amphiphile-rich coacervate phase.

Herein, we explored
the ability of the complex coacervate droplets to sequester the anionic
(MO and AR and cationic CV and RB) dyes and curcumin from the aqueous
medium. Though sequestration of the dyes by visual inspection is relatively
the best option because the coloration of phases after phase separation
is direct evidence of this extraction phenomenon, with electron microscopy
and UV–visible absorption spectroscopy, we can determine the
sequestration of dye quantitatively.

We define the partition
coefficient, log P, the
molar ratio between the dye dispersed per unit volume in the coacervate
phase versus that in the lower dilute phase to further characterize
the results of sequestration. log P is expected to
give a relative characterization of the sequestration within coacervates
droplets. Negative values of log P define that the
aqueous phase is richer in the dye concentration, whereas positive
values describe the more encapsulation efficiency in the coacervate
phase. The values of log P for all of the systems
investigated are reported in Table 3. log P has been calculated as per
the equation below  where the numerator and denominator define
the concentration of dye in the coacervates and dilute aqueous phase,
respectively.

The sequestration data obtained for
the studied dyes in the complex
coacervate droplets formed in the C8EMeImBr (112.5 mM)/NaSal
(200 mM) system are reported in Figures 7 and 8. It is to be
mentioned here that at the selected composition, the coacervates are
negatively charged (Table 2, zeta potential data, vide supra) and have yolk–shell
type particles with sponge morphology as evidenced from Figures 3b and 4b. We believe that the yolk–shell particles with the “sponge”
morphology that are composed of a hollow spherical shell and a smaller
yolk (solid sphere) in their interior could sequester the dye molecules
more efficiently. As reported in Figure 7, the intensity of the characteristic absorption
peak of MO (3.86 × 10–5 M) in the supernatant
phase at 463 nm is almost the same as that of MO (4.05 × 10–5 M) in the aqueous phase without coacervates. This
means that almost all MO (more than 95%) remains in the aqueous phase,
and no MO was extracted by the coacervate phase (Table 3). Optical microscopy images
in Figure 10b confirm
that the MO dye remains in the aqueous phase rather than the coacervate
phase. Similar results are observed for the AR dye (Figures 7 and 10d, Table 3). Contrary
to this, polyacrylamide-mediated coacervation of the gemini surfactant
absorb 95% MO dye in the coacervate phase (at equimolar concentration).49 The negatively charged dyes sequestered negligibly,
which is evident from their negative values of log P. log P values for MO and AR are −1.30 and
−1.72, respectively (Table 3). As IL-based coacervates are negatively charged (zeta
potential results, vide infra), negatively charged dyes are not sequestered
within coacervate droplets.

for RB dye. Inset figures demonstrate visual images of neat, before
encapsulated, and after encapsulated dyes with N, B, and A, respectively.
The encapsulated dye samples extracted in spatula are shown in the
inset.

By contrast, all positively charged
dyes were sequestered within
the upper coacervate phase. Interestingly, CV and RB are fully sequestered
in the upper coacervate phase. This was also evidenced from the absorbance
and optical microscopy results (Figures 8 and 10a, Table 3). Optical microscopy
images in Figure 10a,c confirm that CV and RB remain in the coacervate phase rather
than the aqueous phase. The partition coefficient values (log P) for CV and RB were found to be 2.92 and 3.33, respectively
(Table 3). Positively
charged dyes interact with the negatively charged complex coacervates
and resulted in higher sequestration.

We adopted a similar method
as we applied for the dyes for the
encapsulation of curcumin. Despite poor solubility in water, curcumin
is used as an antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and wound
healing agent.50 The solubility and hence
the bioavailability of curcumin has been overcome by several strategies,
for example, through encapsulating it within polymer gels and silk
fibroin.50 In the present study, we had
successfully loaded 95.59% curcumin within the complex coacervates
with the 1.33 log P value and is confirmed through
absorbance results and optical microscopy images (Figures 9 and 10e, Table 3). The higher efficiency
of the complex coacervates to load the curcumin may be due to the
higher surface area of the coacervates and the available sites for
adsorption due to its internal honey comb-like structure and sponge
morphology.

(2.70 × 10–3 M) and after (1.19 × 10–4 M) encapsulation. Inset figures demonstrate visual
images of coacervate solution, before addition of dye and after encapsulation
of the dye.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion,
we have proposed IL-based catanionic systems with
the ability to self-organize into complex coacervates over a broad
range of ionic strength as a step toward novel IL-based membrane-free
microreactors. These new age microreactors with “sponge”
morphology and a honey comb-like interior can be looked as multicompartmental
structures in which analysts with varied polarities and functionalities
could be sequestered. The complex coacervates are stable with time
and upto high concentration of NaCl (400 mM) and MgCl2 (100
mM), whereas they are converted into crystalline salt upon the addition
of 100 mM of CaCl2. Moreover, the droplets can be stabilized
by reversible hydrogelation by sodium alginate. We have shown that
cationic dyes are sequestered within anionic coacervates in high yields
by a simple and robust method. These complex coacervates show higher
encapsulation efficiency for the curcumin. These findings support
a microreactor model that is a more efficient, low-cost, and environmentally
benign membrane-free alternative for the removal of dyes from the
water as well as the model to preconcentrate them for various applications.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials
All
the reagents studied
in the present investigation (bromoacetic acid, n-octanol, n-hexane, ethyl acetate, chloroform, N-methyl imidazole, methanol, NaCl, MgCl2, CaCl2, sodium alginate, p-toluene sulphonic acid
monohydrate, sodium salicylate, CV, MO, AR, RB, and curcumin) were
of analytical grade, purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and used as received.

4.2 Synthesis of ILBS (3-Methyl-1-(octyloxycarbonylmethyl)imidazolium
Bromide)
Ester-functionalized ILBS 3-methyl-1-(octyloxycarbonylmethyl)imidazolium
bromides, C8EMeImBr with molecular formula C14H25BrN2O2 and a molecular weight
of 333.26 g/mole, was synthesized in our laboratory following the
two-step procedure.24 Briefly, in the first
step, the octyl-2-bromoacetate was synthesized by mixing n-octanol (10 mmol, 16 mL) and bromoacetic acid (12 mmol, 8.63 mL)
at a volume ratio of 1:1.2. In the mixture, p-toluene
sulphonic acid monohydrate (1 mmol, 1.92 g) was added as the catalyst,
and the reaction mixture was heated at 80 °C on the magnetic
stirrer for 4 h. The completion of the reaction was monitored through
TLC (n-hexane/ethyl acetate, 9:1). The reaction mass
was then dissolved in CHCl3 and washed with 100 mL of water
(10 mL aliquots). The product was phase separated, and the reaction
mass was transferred to a rotary evaporator to remove the solvent
and water. Then, the crude product was washed with warm aqueous methanol
(methanol/water, 98:2), phase separated and again taken in a rotary
evaporator to remove excess methanol and water. Purity of the compound
was tested by 1H NMR. In the second step, octyl-2-bromoacetate
(10 mmol, 2.51 g) was reacted with N-methyl imidazole
(10 mmol, 0.80 g) at 90 °C for 2–3 h. TLC with a mobile
phase n-hexane/ethyl acetate ratio of 9:1 was used
to monitor the reaction progress. After cooling the reaction mass
to room temperature, the crude product was repeatedly washed with
100 mL diethyl ether (10 aliquots) and then precipitated in cold acetone
to yield the functionalized IL with yield of 80%.

4.3 Surface
Tension Measurement
Aggregation
behavior of the ILBS is studied through measuring the surface tension
of the aqueous ILBS solution at 25 ± 0.1 °C using K9 tensiometer
(Kruss, Germany) with a platinum–iridium ring. The instrument
was calibrated using triple-distilled water.

4.4 Dynamic
Light Scattering and Zeta Potential
Measurement
DLS and zeta potential were performed using Zetasizer,
Nano-ZS, Malvern Instruments equipped with a built-in temperature
controller having an accuracy of ±0.1 K. The measurements were
made using a quartz cuvette having a path length of 1 cm. The data
were analyzed using the standard algorithms and are reported with
an uncertainty of less than 7%.

4.5 Turbidity
Measurement
Turbidity of
the solutions was measured on a Varian Carry 50 spectrophotometer
(Varian, Switzerland). The instrument is equipped with a thermostatted
cell compartment with a temperature accuracy of ±0.1 K. Samples
were taken in the 1 cm path length quartz cuvette, and the absorbance
was measured at 550 nm where no absorbance for both of the components
was observed. All the measurements were performed in triplicate.

4.6 Optical Microscopy
A Nikon Eclipse
TS 100 microscope was used to determine the size of coacervates. The
microscope was equipped with a high intensity LED eco-illumination
system.

4.7 Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy
A Hitachi S-4800 (Tokyo, Japan) field emission scanning electron
microscope was used to measure the morphology of the complex coacervate
formed through mixing C8EMeImBr (112.5 mM) and NaSal (200
mM). The coacervate droplet was frozen on a clean silica wafer using
liquid nitrogen. This will retain the microstructure of the coacervates.
Then, the frozen sample was immediately lyophilized at −50
°C under vacuum. The lyophilized sample was then coated with
a 1–2 nm thick Pt.

4.8 Construction of Phase Diagram
Stock
solutions of C8EMeImBr and NaSal were prepared separately.
In the stoppered test tube with a cap, C8EMeImBr was taken
in a fixed amount and NaSal was added progressively under stirring
so that the [C8EMeImBr]/[NaSal] ratio varied. The mixtures
were then vortexed and sonicated and allowed to equilibrate at a constant
temperature in a water bath at 298 K. The phases were observed visually
and their equilibrium state was assessed. The experiments were repeated
to test for their reproducibility.

4.9 Sequestration
of Dyes and Measurement of Partition
Coefficients
Partition coefficients were measured by the
ratio of the dye concentration present in the coacervate phase versus
that in the dilute aqueous phase. Dyes and curcumin (stock solution)
were added in the coacervate solution and the solution was vigorously
vortexed for 10 min. Samples were left to stand for 24 h at 25 °C
in the constant temperature bath, and both the coacervate and continuous
aqueous phase were recovered separately in a sample tube. For curcumin,
the mixture was diluted by a mixture of water and methanol (9:1 v/v).
The samples were then analyzed for their absorbance by UV–visible
spectroscopy at the λmax for respective dyes for
aqueous dilute phase. The intensity of a selected absorption peak
was measured for the aqueous phase, and from that, the concentration
of the dye/curcumin in the aqueous phase was determined. For the coacervate
phase, the concentration of the dye/curcumin was determined through
the relationship, (C0 – Ce), where C0 is
the initial concentration of dye, and Ce is the equilibrium concentration of dye in the aqueous dilute phase.

4.10 Epifluorescence Microscopy
The complex
coacervate droplets formed by 112.5 mM of C8EMeImBr and
200 mM of NaSal were visually inspected using a Zeiss “Axio
Scope A1” model (Carl Zeiss Pvt Ltd, Oberkochen, Germany) and
differential interference contrast filters. A drop (about 20 μL)
of the premixed coacervate droplet solution mixed with the fluorescence
dye (10 μL, 2.04 × 10–4 mM rhodamine
6G) was deposited on the glass slide surface, which was previously
cleaned with dry ethanol. Fluorescence images were acquired using
40× magnification using an AxioCam MRc 5 camera under the control
of AxioVision software.
