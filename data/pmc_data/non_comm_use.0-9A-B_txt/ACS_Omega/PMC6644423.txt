Pyrimidines have
always received considerable attention because
of their importance in synthesis and elucidation of biochemical
roles, in particular that of vitamin B1. Herein, we describe a reaction
pathway in a Grignard reagent-based synthesis of substituted pyrimidines.
A general synthesis of α-keto-2-methyl-4-amino pyrimidines and
their C6-substituted analogues from 4-amino-5-cyano-2-methylpyrimidine
is reported. The presence of the nitrile substituent in the starting
material also results in an unusual reaction pathway leading to C6-substituted
1,2-dihydropyrimidines. Grignard reagents that give normal pyrimidine
products under standard reaction conditions can be switched to give
dihydropyrimidines by holding the reaction at 0 °C before quenching.

Introduction
The synthesis of pyrimidines
has always been a priority topic for
investigation because of their widespread use as scaffolds in medicinal,
pharmaceutical, and academic chemistries. Recently, there has been
a marked return to prominence of these structures, particularly in
the functionalized amino pyrimidine series,1 as synthetic targets. Although a majority of these examples are
2-amino pyrimidines, examples of 4-2 and
6-aminopyrimidines3 are also notable features.
These vital building blocks of life are found in many biologically
significant molecules, including structures like DNA 1, drugs such as zidovudine 2,4,5 and
barbiturate sodium thiopental 3 (Figure 1). Pyrimidines are also investigated for
the treatment of the neurological disorders Beriberi and Korsakoff
syndrome and as a recognition motif for binding in thiamine diphosphate-dependent
enzymes (compound 4, Figure 1).6,7

Because of their versatile
hydrogen-bonding interactions, these
small fragments have been intensively investigated by medicinal chemists
during the past decade. Their applications in GSK’s antimalaria
drug trimethoprim 5,8 antibiotic
bacimethrin 6,9 and in the
treatments of thiamine deficiency,10−12 are well-documented
(Figure 2).

Commonly, the synthesis of pyrimidine rings utilizes
a sodium alkoxide-catalyzed
condensation reaction between urea, an aldehyde, and a malonic ester.
Most methodologies to form these rings utilize this process, now called
the Biginelli reaction.13−15 Assembly of the core aromatic
structure permits further functionalization with a range of reactive
groups. The initial synthetic strategies to access the valuable 4-amino-2-methyl
pyrimidine substitution pattern were originally developed by Williams16 (Scheme 1). The reported procedure is outlined below and was subsequently
modified by others for the development and production scale-up of
vitamin B1 synthesis.

Scheme 1 Williams’ Synthesis of 4-Amino-2-methyl
Pyrimidine
Although the 4-amino-2-methyl
pyrimidines have been investigated
with many differing structural modifications,17−19 there are very
few examples for the synthesis of α-keto-4-amino-2-methyl pyrimidines
and their analogues.20 As the core pyrimidine
ring is observed widely throughout nature, it was surprising to find
such a lack of examples because these α-keto structural analogues
could be good candidates for inhibitor mimics and for potential structural
manipulations in structure–activity relationship studies. To
address this issue, we have devised a new synthetic route, which uses
cheap and readily available starting materials, to construct α-keto-4-amino-2-methyl
pyrimidines.

Results and Discussion
Our approach
to α-keto-4-amino-2-methyl pyrimidines is based
on the inclusion of a nitrile substituent at the 5-position to enable
the introduction of a wide variety of R groups. This allows us to
exploit the easy availability of 2-methyl-4-amino-5-cyano-pyrimidines
(Scheme 2).17

Scheme 2 Synthetic Approach to Access α-Keto-4-amino-2-methyl
Pyrimidines
with a Wide Variety of R Groups
Thus, our synthesis of a range of differently substituted
α-keto-2-methyl-4-amino
pyrimidines began by employing the established condensation reaction
of cheap and accessible reagents, acetamidine hydrochloride 14 and ethoxymethylenemalonitrile 15, which after
recrystallization of the crude product from ethanol gave the required
nitrile 13 in a 78% yield (Scheme 3, step 1).17

Scheme 3 New Synthesis of the Pyrimidyl Ketones
We now turned to a series of preliminary experiments to
assess
the optimum temperature for addition of the Grignard reagent to the
nitrile. Addition of the Grignard reagent at 0 °C and warming
to 40 °C gave total consumption of the starting material after
16 h. Lower temperatures resulted in incomplete consumption and required
longer reaction times. Addition of the appropriate Grignard reagent
produced the desired keto products 12 with various R
groups after simple column chromatography in yields of 16–68%
(see Scheme 4 and Table 1, product type A). The infrared spectra of the products showed an unusually
low position for the C=O stretching vibration of the ketones
at about 1650 cm–1. In the 1H nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra, the signals for the NH2 protons came at two separate chemical shifts, presumably because
of H-bonding to the adjacent carbonyl oxygen by one of the protons
of the amino substituent. This strong intramolecular hydrogen bonding
also accounts for the unusual position of the C=O stretching
vibration for these compounds and is consistent with the data reported
for 1-(2-aminophenyl)ethanone.21 During
the purification of our ketone products, it became apparent that other
byproducts had been formed during the Grignard reaction. Characterization
of these byproducts allowed us to identify some unexpected structures,
which reveal an unusual alternative pathway for the addition of the
Grignard reagent at the C-6 position of the pyrimidine ring (Scheme 4, product types B and C).

a Grignard reagent was added at 0
°C, and the reaction mixture was then warmed to 40 °C and
then left to cool and stirred at rt overnight.

c By procedure III (Grignard reagent
was added at 40 °C).

d By procedure II (like procedure
I but neutralized with aqueous NaHCO3, before extraction).

e By procedure IV in which the
reaction
temperature was maintained at 0 °C for 3 h before being allowed
to warm to rt overnight.

The formation of these unexpected substitution patterns (see Scheme 4) was apparent from
the lack of the C6 aromatic proton at ∼8.0 ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum and the retained strong C≡N stretching
vibration at 2100 cm–1 in the infrared spectrum.
After adjusting the reaction conditions, addition of the methyl and
ethyl Grignard reagents at 40 °C instead of 0 °C gave the
[1,2]-dihydropyrimidine analogues of type C in good yields
(80–85%). These structures were identified by the presence
of the methyl signal as a doublet with 3J coupling (6.0 Hz) to the CH proton (q, 3J = 6.0 Hz) located at 4.1 ppm (e.g., see Figure 3). The assignment of these spectral features
was confirmed by the analysis of 1H correlation spectroscopy
data. The [1,2]-dihydro products also retained the distinctive nitrile
stretch at 2100 cm–1 in their infrared spectra.
The key features discussed above allow the characterization data for
the products of type B/C and the anticipated
product of type A to be easily distinguished. Remarkably,
these [1,2]-dihydro compounds remained stable at room temperature
over a period of weeks, despite the loss of aromaticity following
the addition of the Grignard reagent. Some aryl-22 and ferrocenyl-substituted23 examples appear to share the same stability shown by our nitrile-substituted
structures, whereas Lyle24 has reported
instability in the cyano-substituted dihydropyridine analogues.

racemic 17 with the CHMe feature that
gives a characteristic C6 quartet and C7 doublet in the 1H NMR spectrum.

A plausible mechanism
for the synthesis of side products of types B/C could arise as a consequence of the Schlenk
equilibrium25 between the Grignard reagent
RMgX, R2Mg, and MgX2. Coordination of the Lewis
acidic MgX2 to the N1 nitrogen of the pyrimidine to form 16 would make the C6 position more electrophilic and hence
promote attack by the Grignard reagent (Scheme 5). Moreover, an electron-withdrawing group
adjacent to this position would further increase the electrophilicity
of the C6 position providing an explanation for why, in the 5-cyano
series, this side-reaction is far more favored. An alternative possibility,
however, would be a radical mechanism for the transfer of the R group,
followed by loss of H• by an oxidative step to form 17.

Scheme 5 Proposed Mechanism of the formation of [1,2]-Dihydropyrimidine 17
Examples of reactions
that are capable of forming stereogenic centers
from an aromatic system using Grignard reagents are rare, but a notable
precedent for this type of transformation has been described in the
synthesis of antifungal agent Voriconazole by Pfizer.26 The methyl and ethyl C6-substituted analogues have been
reported previously in the synthesis of vitamin B1 analogues,
but were acquired by condensation chemistry as described by Todd et
al.27,28 This condensation approach has not been
applied to the synthesis of other analogues containing modifications
at this position, so the new examples described here, which are obtained
by the Grignard approach, will open up a general access to this class
of structures.

Interestingly, the Schlenk equilibrium is often
controlled by changes
to the Grignard reagent, solvent, or temperature. To assess the optimum
conditions, a range of temperatures from (−78 to 40 °C)
were tested, but this served only to increase the consumption of the
starting nitrile 13 and did not affect the product outcome.
It was noticeable that addition of the Grignard at 0 °C followed
by warming to 40 °C gave a mixture of products, so some Grignard
additions at 40 °C were attempted. As the Schlenk equilibrium
should favor formation of the R1MgX species at higher temperatures
and in a polar aprotic solvent, the involvement of Lewis acidic MgX2 could be reduced, and therefore C-6 addition should be decreased.
This, however, with our initial choice of methyl and ethyl Grignard
reagents, gave 17 and 21 as the sole products
(Table 1, entries 2
and 4).

A range of solvents were then examined to assess their
affect upon
product distribution. As tetrahydrofuran (THF) had already been used
for the preliminary experiments, we sought to decrease the solvent
polarity. Diethyl ether was tested under the same conditions, and
from the analysis of the 1H NMR spectra, it was obvious
that only methyl ketone and the unreacted starting material were present.
Attempts using 1,4-dioxane resulted in the precipitation of the MgX2 salts. Removal of these MgX2 salts by filtration
was expected to improve the selectivity for the formation of the ketone
compound; however, this proved not to be the case, and the under these
conditions, the attempted reaction gave only the recovered unreacted
starting material.

On the basis of the mechanism proposed in Scheme 5, it seemed probable
that the products that
retained the nitrile group originated by initial addition of the nucleophile
to the heteroaromatic ring (producing the [1,2]-dihydro product of
type C) and that oxidation under the reaction conditions
later resulted in rearomatization to give 5-cyano-6-alkyl-2-methylpyrimidine
products of type B. This hypothesis was tested for Grignard
reagents (R1 = Et, Pr, Bu, and Ph; Table 1 entries 3, 5, 8, and 12) that tended to
give low yields and only products of types A and B. By avoiding the high temperature of 40 °C and keeping
the reaction mixture at 0 °C for 3 h, more time was allowed for
the addition at C6 to go to completion before the reaction was quenched.

Under these conditions (Table 1, entries 6, 9, 10, and 13), the [1,2]-dihydro products
of type C were isolated at moderate to good yields. Bulky
Grignard reagents (branched R1 groups such as i-Pr and t-Bu) give poorer results (56 and 42%, respectively).
In the other cases, (R1 = Me, Et, Pr, and Bu), the yields
of the [1,2]-dihydro products ranged from 67 to 87%. Extending the
study to phenyl- and vinylmagnesium bromide, we were able to show
that the low temperature conditions worked well to improve the yields
with phenylmagnesium bromide, giving [1,2]-dihydro product 31 in an 81% yield (compare entries 12 and 13), and our original 40
°C reaction conditions were suitable with vinylmagnesium bromide,
giving 32 in a 76% yield.

On the basis of these
trends, it appears that the unexpected formation
of [1,2]-dihydropyrimidine is in fact the preferred addition pathway
and proceeds efficiently, albeit slowly, at 0 °C. At higher temperatures,
the addition at the nitrile begins to become significant, so that
reactions that are allowed to warm up before all of the Grignard reagent
has been consumed can produce substantial amounts of the ketones (type A products). Type B products in many cases arise
by rearomatization of [1,2]-dihydropyrimidines, accounting for the
failure to isolate type C products in these cases. In
other cases, however, the addition of the Grignard reagent can be
performed at 40 °C to give methyl- and ethyl-substituted [1,2]-dihydropyrimidines
in a high yield. We proposed that this difference arises from the
differences in stability of type C products under strong
acid (HCl; entries 1, 3, 5, 8, and 12) conditions used in the quench,
compared to the weak acid (ammonium chloride) used for entries 2,
4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, and 14. Steric bulk in the nucleophile (e.g.,
entry 8) seems to block addition at the nitrile, and type A products were not formed with butylmagnesium bromide. Alkynyl Grignard
reagents are less reactive and HC≡CMgBr failed to add to 13, even at 40 °C.

Crystallization and X-ray analysis
of the simple methyl substituted
example 17 confirmed the [1,2]-dihydro structure and
the presence of the stereogenic center at C6 (Figure 4). C6 is displaced 0.078(2) Å from the
good mean plane of the rest of the heterocyclic ring, which supports
the presence of extended π-overlap into the nitrile substituent.
The shorter bond length of C1–C2 [1.379(2) Å] when compared
to the C1–C6 bond of the C–CHMe [1.510(2) Å] suggests
the presence of the alkene π bond in conjugation with the nitrile
substituent within the aromatic π-system.

structure of 4-amino-2-methyl-5-cyano-6-methyl-[1,2]-dihydropyrimid-ine 17. Thermal ellipsoids are drawn at the 50% probability level.

Measurement of the CN bond length
C11–N12 [1.158(2) Å]
indicates a typical length for this group, although the C1–C11
C–CN [1.402(2) Å] bond length lies between a normal C–C
bond (1.5 Å) and an sp2 C=C (1.3 Å), thereby
suggesting the presence of a partial sp2 bond character
between the aromatic π-system and the nitrile bond. At C6, the
CHMe position adopts the classic tetrahedral geometry with a bond
angle for the atom group N5–C6–H6 at 109.0(9)°
and the bond length for C1–C6 at 1.510(2) Å, whereas the
shorter bonds between the sp2 centers of C1–C2 and
C4–N3 have lengths of 1.379(2) and 1.312(2) Å, respectively.
Interestingly, these structures form a hydrogen-bonded dimer pair
(racemic, with R and S configurations)
around a center of symmetry, forming a binding pattern similar to
that observed in DNA base pairs (Figure 4), which becomes extended through further
pairs of hydrogen bonds (see the Supporting Information).

This paper identifies three competing pathways for the addition
of Grignard reagents to the readily available 4-amino-2-methyl-5-cyanopyrimidine
starting material, giving access to either the sought after α-keto-4-amino-2-methyl
pyrimidines or alternative products arising from substitution of the
pyrimidine ring itself. Especially in the cases where the exclusive
formation of a single product has been identified, the results presented
here should open the way for the exploitation of these substitution
patterns in future research. Furthermore, studies are now in progress
to extend the range of examples that give exclusively the unusual
chiral 1,2-dihydropyrimidines to introduce alternative reactive functional
groups at the C6 position (e.g., alkynes) to prepare the way for the
development of an enantioselective version of the procedure.

Ideally, this research would facilitate a wider range of ongoing
synthetic modifications such as Diels–Alder cycloaddition chemistry
and metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions, which could utilize
the vinyl adduct 32. Each in their own way, the intended
α-keto products and the unusual ring-substituted products are
ideal structures to access a wide range of pyrimidine-derived compounds
that will be of value in medicinal and bioorganic chemistry. Our procedure
avoids the need for extensive purification steps and so provides a
potential “gateway compound” suited for easy functionalization
in future studies. It also offers potential access to key intermediates
in the substantial quantities needed for sustained biochemical/pharmaceutical
research projects and scale-up processes.29 Furthermore, the ketones made available in this way would be suitable
prochiral candidates for reductions to provide useful intermediates
for the chiral synthetic pool and/or enzymatic studies.30,31

Experimental Section
General Considerations
All reactions
were carried out
in dry solvents, unless otherwise stated. Anhydrous THF, diethyl ether,
and toluene were distilled over sodium following literature methods.
All solvents and chemicals were purchased from appropriate suppliers
including Sigma-Aldrich, Acros, TCI, Fluorochem, Alfa Aesar, and Fisher.
Infrared spectra were obtained on a PerkinElmer spectrum 100 Fourier
transform infrared spectrometer, with most compounds dissolved in
dichloromethane and measured as a film on a NaCl disc. In cases where
compounds were not soluble in this solvent, the infrared spectrum
was obtained using an attenuation total reflection plate. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were obtained using a Bruker (Ascend)
500 MHz spectrometer and a sample express autosampler. Mass spectra
were measured by the EPSRC UK National Mass Spectrometry Facility,
Swansea, UK using an LTQ Orbitrap XL spectrometer. Melting points
were recorded on a BUCHI melting point apparatus B545. X-ray diffraction
data were recorded at the UEA on an Oxford Diffraction Xcalibur-3/Sapphire3
CCD diffractometer. The data were then processed with the CrysAlisPro-CCD
and -RED programs.32,33 The structure was determined
by the direct method routines in the SHELXS program34 and refined by full-matrix least-squares methods on F2’s in SHELXL34 using WinGX.35 Scattering factors for
neutral atoms were taken from the International Tables for X-ray Crystallography.36

Filtration through celite gave a clear solution, which upon addition
of ethoxymethylene malonitrile (0.50 g, 4.10 mmol) produced a yellow

magnesium turnings (427 mg, 17.8 mmol, 2.0 equiv) in anhydrous THF
(20 mL). After activation with a small amount of iodine, addition
was maintained to keep a gentle reflux. The reaction was then stirred
at room temperature (rt) for 3 h. The Grignard reagent was titrated
against 1,10-phenanthroline and isopropyl alcohol.
