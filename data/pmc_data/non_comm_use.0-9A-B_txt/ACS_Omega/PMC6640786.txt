An analytic solution
to enzyme kinetics expressed by the Michaelis–Menten–Monod
mathematical framework is presented. The analytic solution describes
the implicit problem with the independent variable, normally time,
substituted with the concentration of the reaction product. The analytic
solution provides the substrate, enzyme, and microbial biomass concentration
instantaneously and over all time domains without the use of numerical
integration schemes or iterative solvers required to overcome transcendental
functions. Experiments of NO2– nitrification
by Candidatus Nitrospira defluvii at
temperatures ranging between 10 and 32 °C were used for validation
tests with the numerical solution by finite differences and the implicit
analytic solution presented here. Results showed that both finite
differences and analytic solutions matched the experiments particularly
well, with a correlation coefficient greater than 0.99 and residuals
smaller than 2.75%.

Introduction
The Michaelis–Menten–Monod
(MMM) framework18,19 is one of the most common reaction
kinetics as it can describe biochemical
reactions in various contexts. The MMM kinetics include only two chemical
parameters, that is, the reaction rate constant k and the Michaelis–Menten (affinity) constant K, and three biological parameters, that is, the biomass mortality
rate δ and the biomass and enzyme yields Y and z, respectively, which are combined as in the generalized
equations for biochemical isotope kinetics (GEBIK14).

An analytic solution to the Michaelis–Menten
kinetics exists
in an implicit form, that is, with the time expressed as a function
of the substrate concentration,23,26 and an explicit form
has recently been achieved, with the use of the Lambert W function.25 Note, however, that the explicit W form leads to a solving function that eventually is iterative
in nature.4,8 An analytic solution to the MMM kinetics
when microbial biomass expresses a substantial effect on the reaction
rate has not yet been attempted in either explicit or implicit form.
The peculiarity is that two ordinary nonlinear differential equations
have to be solved simultaneously in the MMM kinetics, one of which
being the Michaelis–Menten equation for the chemicals and the
other describing the microbial biomass Monod dynamics.

The aim
of this study is to derive and test an implicit analytic
solution of the coupled problem of substrate consumption according
to Michaelis–Menten kinetics and biomass dynamics according
to Monod kinetics. The advantage of having an analytic solution is
that iterative solvers such as those required to solve transcendental
functions or finite-difference methods are not involved. To test the
validity of the proposed solution, the kinetic parameters were determined
with a finite-difference solution and the analytic solution against
the experimental data of NO2– nitrification
(oxidation) by Candidatus Nitrospira defluvii at temperatures ranging between 10 and 32 °C,11 and reciprocality tests were carried out for the two solving
schemes to measure the goodness of matching.

Results and Discussion
Theory
Consider an enzymatic reaction that consumes
a substrate S and produces a product P through an enzyme E. Using the 1913 Michaelis–Menten
reaction framework,12S is assumed to attach to E to form an activated
complex C‡ in equilibrium with S and E, which releases P and the free, unchanged enzyme E. During the consumption
of S, the microbial species carrying out the reaction
increases its biomass B proportionally to the biomass
yield coefficient Y, which expresses the biomass
gain per mole of consumed substrate, and it decreases according to
a first-order mortality rate δ. Microorganisms, as a consequence
of metabolic processes, produce the enzyme E that
feeds back the reaction as long as S is available.
These complexation reactions state the MMM kinetics and can be expressed
as 1a   1b  where k+ and k– are the rate constants
of the forward
and backward equilibrium reactions between reactants (S and E) and activated complex (C‡), and k is the reaction rate
constant. Here, it is assumed that the enzyme concentration is proportional
to the microbial biomass by a factor z, that is,
the enzyme is produced and degrades at the same rate as biomass growth
and mortality as E = zB. Under these
working hypotheses, the system of differential equations stating the
MMM problem for S, P, B, and E can be derived from the GEBIK equations
under the quasi-steady-state assumption14 and take the form 2a   2b   2c   2d  under
the hypothesis that k– and k+ are greater
than k and that the quasi-steady-state assumption
is satisfied for C‡ (i.e., dC‡/dt ≃ 0 and C‡ ≃ 0). In these circumstances,
the Michaelis–Menten half-saturation concentration is K = (k– + k)/k+.2,10

In the
system of eq 2, S(t), P(t), B(t), and E(t)
are explicit functions of the independent variable time t. Note also that eq 2a and c are independent, whereas eq 2b is equivalent to eq 2a with the opposite sign
and eq 2d is proportional
to eq 2c by a factor z. For the solution proposed here, it is convenient to consider P as the independent variable and to express S(P), B(P), E(P), and t(P) as functions of P. To this aim, eq 2a,c is rewritten
as 3a   3b  where S(t) is substituted by S(P) =S0 – P as per mass balance S0 + P0 = S + P,
with the initial value S0 = S(P) when P = P0 = 0.

The analytic solution to eq 3b is (see Appendix A) 4  with the initial biomass concentration B0 = B(P) when P = 0. Equation 4 includes a logarithm of P that, propagated into
the system of eq 3, would lead to a transcendental
problem. To circumvent this without the use of iterative solvers of
transcendental functions either in their nude form or in the form
of Lambert W function, a polynomial Taylor expansion
to the second-order in P is used for B(P) in eq 3a as 5  Equation 5 is valid
as long as B(P) > 0; excluding
values P < 0, this condition
is satisfied if 6  with G = 2S0(zkYS0 −δS0 −δK) and J = 8zkB0δKS02. Note that  implies t → ∞
as in the asymptotic approach to equilibrium of eqs 2 and is a case
that can be excluded for practical applications. Substituting eq 5 into eq 3a and solving t(P) with the initial value t(P = 0) = 0, one obtains the implicit solution for t(P) as (see Appendix B) 7  or, equivalently, 8  with the constants 9a   9b   9c   9d   9e   9f  under the condition 10  

Equations 4 and 8 represent the implicit analytic solutions for B and t as functions of P. The solutions for S and E can
then be calculated as 11   12  with B(P) as in eq 4.

Methods of Testing
To test the application of the implicit
analytic solution of the MMM problem given by eqs 4, 8, 11, and 12, independent data sets of NO2– nitrification by C. N.
defluvii at six temperatures between 10 and 32 °C
were used.11 In using these experiments,
O2 and carbon sources were assumed to be not limiting.

The unknown parameters in the MMM kinetics (i.e., k, K, Y, and B0) were determined by solving the inverse problem stated by eq 2 with an explicit finite-difference numerical
scheme and with the implicit analytic solution proposed here against
the experimental data using the nonlinear least-square fitting algorithm
implemented in PEST.5 The biomass mortality
rate δ = 10–6 s–1 (refs (7) and (24)) and enzyme yield coefficient z = 10–10 mol mg–1,
which was estimated assuming that 1% of the microbial biomass with
an enzyme having 105 g mol–1 molar mass
(i.e., 100 kDa = 1.66 × 10–19 g mol–1)21 were used. In contrast to k and K, the biomass yield Y was assumed not to change with the temperature; hence, only one
value was estimated and used at each experimental temperature.

For calculation of the numerical solution, an explicit finite-difference
technique was implemented. The integration time step dt = 0.5 h was used and verified to provide stable solution at all
experimental temperatures. For calculation of the analytic solution,
the constants in eq 9 were first determined
(note that they depend only on the parameters k, K, Y and on the initial conditions S0 and B0) and then
were used in eqs 4, 8, 11, and 12 with values of P ∈ [0,(1 –
ϵ)S0], and with ϵ ≪
1 as an arbitrary residual, to retrieve the time t(P) at which P, S(P), B(P), and E(P) occurred. The goodness of fit for
both solving schemes against the experiments was measured with the
correlation coefficient R and normalized root-mean-square
distance (NRMSD) 13   14  where X and Y represent the modeled and experimental
NO2– concentrations over time, respectively,
and n is
the number of experimental points.

The two sets of kinetic parameters
were then used to cross-validate
the implicit analytic solution provided by eqs 4, 8, 11, and 12 in reciprocality tests, and R and NRMSD were used in this case to quantify the goodness
of fit of the two solving schemes against each other.

The analytic solution calculated for the independent variable P ∈ [0,(1 – 10–3)S0] and with S0 as
per experiments was tested against the condition in eq 6 to verify its validity using parameters
and initial conditions given in Table 1 at each experimental temperature. The upper boundary
to P in eq 6 turned out to be , whereas the maximum P used in
the analytic solution was P = (1 –
10–3)S0 ≃ 10–4 mol/L in all temperature ranges, thus eq 6 was always satisfied. Analogously,
tests against the condition in eq 10 show that the upper boundary  ranged
between 10–2 and
10–1 mol/L, thus the used P values
also satisfied the condition given in eq 10. The testing approach, therefore, always
satisfied the conditions for P and allowed computation
of the implicit solution of t, S, B, and E.

Corresponding
parameters determined with the two solving schemes
were found to be close to each other at all tested temperatures, with
variability |Δx|/x̅ for
each parameter x ranging between 0.48% and 5.22%
for kinetic parameters (k and K)
and between 0.01% and 1.9% for biological parameters (Y and B0). Note that the product zkY = μ corresponds to the maximum specific biomass
growth rate used in MMM kinetics when the enzyme dynamics is not explicitly
accounted for1,22 and reflects typical values of
similar biochemical N reactions by soil and aquatic
microorganisms found in earlier studies using numerical solutions,
that is: μ = zkY ≃ 10–6 1/s and Y ≃ 104 mg/mol.9,13,14 Note also that these parameters
were found to show a temperature dependence that aligns, at least
over a limited temperature range, to an Arrhenius-like law, as already
documented in earlier studies in ref (15) based on experiments in refs (3)(16), and (17).

The explicit numerical
solution matched experiments with a goodness
of fit R > 0.99 and NRMSD < 2.2% (Table 2, columns 2 and 3);
the implicit
analytic solution achieved a goodness of fit R >
0.99 and NRMSD < 2.75% (Table 2, columns 4 and 5). Trends in parameter values and
in goodness of fit were consistent in both solving schemes at the
tested temperatures.

Implicit Analytic Solution and Explicit Numerical Solution
Along with the goodness of fit summarized in Table 2, visual inspection of NO2– and B concentrations in Figure 1 shows that absolute values and trends in NO2– and B concentrations calculated with
the two solving schemes reflected those of experiments at all tested
temperatures.

Solution Reciprocality
MMM kinetics obtained with independent
parameter estimations in Figure 1 achieved a reciprocal matching quantified by NRMSD
<2.7% in NO2– and NRMSD <9.1% in B (Table 3, columns 2 and 3). Reciprocal use of the best parameter set for
one solving scheme with the other schemes resulted in NRMSD <0.7%
in NO2– and NRMSD <5.5% in B (Table 3, columns 4–7). Reciprocality tests presented here suggest,
therefore, that differences in solutions were small and within a typical
experimental uncertainty of 5–10%. Results also suggest that
either the explicit numerical solution or the implicit analytic solution
can be used for the purposes of calibration of kinetic and biological
parameters.

Conclusions
An experimentally and
numerically validated implicit analytic solution
to the MMM kinetics was presented. The analytic solution produced
calculated values of substrate, product, and biomass concentration
substantially equivalent to the numerical solution obtained by finite
differences and observed to be stable and computable within its mathematical
domain. This approach has the advantage of allowing fast calculation
without the need to introduce numerical iterative solvers such as
those used in the computation of transcendental functions. Additionally,
it does not require validation of time integration (e.g., Courant
criterion) such as in implicit and explicit finite-difference methods.
The analytic solution proposed here can be used in the estimation
of kinetic parameters from experimental and laboratory biochemical
assays of nutrient and substrate consumption, but it may be particularly
suited for application to large-scale reactive transport models used
in climate and earth sciences, which may account for a large number
of kinetic reactions over dense computational meshes. Implementations
into large-scale computational tools, however, may have to be investigated
further depending on the numerical schemes used to solve over a finite-time-step
multiple processes occurring at a range of temporal and spatial scales.
