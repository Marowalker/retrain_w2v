Polyphosphazene microspheres were fabricated by ultrasonic-assisted
precipitation polymerization using 4,4′-(hexafluoroisopropylidene)diphenol,
4,4′-sulfonyldiphenol, 4,4-(9-fluorenylidene)diphenol, and
phenolphthalein to obtain poly[4,4′-(hexafluoroisopropylidene)diphenol]phosphazene
(PZAF), poly(4,4′- sulfonyldiphenol)phosphazene (PZS), poly[4,4'-(9-fluorenylidene)diphenol]phosphazene,
and poly(phenolphthalein)phosphazene (PZPT) and were incorporated
into polybenzoxazines (PBa) to obtain corresponding PZAF/PBa, PZS/PBa,
fluorenyl polyphosphazene (PZFP)/PBa, and PZPT/PBa composites. Addition
of 5 wt % of PZAF, PZS, PZFP, and PZPT microspheres improved the thermal
stability and fire retardancy of PBa resin significantly. Notably,
addition of PBa with 5% PZAF led to a 62.5% decrease in the peak heat
release rate and 49.3% reduction in total heat release. The role of
microspheres in the gas-phase flame-retardancy mechanism in the PBa
matrix was studied. Dynamic mechanical analysis results demonstrated
that the Tg of PBa flame-retardant composites
was still around 210 °C compared to 221 °C of pure PBa.
Hence, the synthesized PBa composites had potential applications as
high flame-retardancy materials.

1 Introduction
Polybenzoxazine resins
are a new type of phenolic resins, which
are obtained by ring-opening polymerization. They possess excellent
mechanical properties, low water absorptivity, and near-zero shrinkage
behavior after polymerization.1−4 These performances increase the scope of applications
of these polymers in military, aeronautics, and astronautics, automotive,
and electronics fields.5−8 However, bisphenol A-based benzoxazine (Ba) has a low limiting oxygen
index (LOI) of about 22, which restricts its application in certain
fields.9 As a result, the fire resistance
properties of polybenzoxazines (PBa) have to be improved.

In
the past few decades, different types of flame retardants and
fire-quenching mechanisms have been introduced to reduce the high
combustibility of polymeric materials.10 It is well known that traditional halogen flame retardants produce
corrosive and toxic gases and hence are not environmentally safe and
sustainable.11−13 Halogen-free flame-retardant additives have recently
attracted a lot of attention from both researchers and industrialists.
Common halogen-free flame retardants, which contain phosphorus, nitrogen,
and silicon, have been used in epoxy resins and have proven to cause
no environmental problems.14−17 Owing to their high efficiency, phosphorus–nitrogen
flame retardants have been widely used in the above systems.18

Polyphosphazenes, a group of multipurpose
organic–inorganic
hybrid materials, possess many superior properties, such as superior
mechanical property, high LOI, and thermal stability.19,20 It is well known that polyphosphazenes have been used as biomaterials,
optical materials, electrical materials, hybrid materials, and so
forth.19,21 The main chain of polyphosphazenes contains
−P=N– units and exhibits self-extinguishing behavior
in flame tests. They can be categorized into three types: linear phosphazene
polymers and polyphosphazenes-containing cyclophosphazene units in
main chain or side chains.22−24 Cyclotriphosphazenes are similar
to graphene, diamond, fullerenes, and carbon nanotubes and are characterized
by layered, cubical, spherical, or tubular structures.23−25 Moreover, micro- or nanoscale polymeric materials, such as polyphosphazene
nanotubes, microspheres, nanofibers, nanochains, and so forth, have
also been successfully synthesized from cyclotriphosphazenes by condensation
polymerization.24,26,27 For example, in order to improve the fire performance of epoxy resins,
Liu et al. synthesized a novel azaphosphorine flame retardant (ADDPP-OH)
containing P–C–N bond. The LOI value of the ADDPP-OH–EP
composites reached 33.7% with a rating grade of UL-94V-0. At the same
time, ADDPP-OH improved the thermal and mechanical properties of EP.28 Three polyphosphazenes with different terminal
groups were applied with ammonium polyphosphate to prepare flame-retardant
polylactic acid (PLA). Introduction of cyclotriphosphazene endowed
PLA with good flame retardancy. However, different terminal groups
of flame-retardant additives show different flame-retardancy properties.29

Considering the characteristics of PBa,
series of polyphosphazene
microspheres were synthesized by ultrasound-assisted precipitation
polymerization and were introduced into ploybenzoxazines to improve
their thermal stabilities and flame-retardancy properties. The effects
of polyphosphazene microsphere structures on the thermal stability,
flame retardancy, and thermal performance of PBa were further investigated
in detail.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of Polyphosphazene Microspheres
The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of poly[4,4′-(hexafluoroisopropylidene)diphenol]phosphazene
(PZAF), poly(4,4′- sulfonyldiphenol)phosphazene (PZS), fluorenyl
polyphosphazene (PZFP), and poly(phenolphthalein)phosphazene (PZPT)
microspheres are shown in Figure 1. The small absorption peak at 1013 cm–1 is attributed to the CF3 of 4,4′-(hexafluoroisopropylidene)diphenol
(BPAF). Meanwhile, the strong peaks at 1186 and 883 cm–1 correspond to the P–N and P=N characteristic absorption
of cyclotriphosphazene, respectively. The intensive absorption perk
at 941 cm–1 is assigned to the P–O–Ar
band, which is the obvious evidence to prove the occurrence of polycondensation
between comonomers hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene (HCCP) and BPAF.
From the Figure 1b,
the main sharp absorption peaks at 1293 and 1153 cm–1 are associated with O=S=O of sulfonyldiphenol units,
and the vibration of C=O from phenolphthalein (PT) of carbonyl
group appeared at 1770 cm–1.Otherwise, the peak
of C=C (1510 cm–1), P=N (1260 cm–1), and P–O–Ar (941 cm–1) also present in the spectrum of PZS, PZFP, and PZPT indirectly
verified that PZAF, PZS, PZFP, and PZPT microspheres were successfully
prepared.

Figure 1 FTIR spectra of PZAF (a), PZS, PZFP, and PZPT (b) microspheres.

The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of
microspheres are
shown in Figure 2.
The PZAF microspheres in Figure 2a appeared uniformly spherical with an average diameter
of about 1.5 μm. Figure 2b–d shows spherical morphologies of PZS, PZFP, and
PZPT microspheres, which had particle size distributions of around
400 nm, 2 μm, and 1.2 μm, respectively. Although they
were prepared using the same procedure, the microspheres had different
sizes. The larger particle size of microspheres was due to the asymmetric
nature of substituents, which destroyed the regularity of molecular
chains and affected the stacking of molecular chains. Moreover, the
presence of multiple benzene ring substituents caused changes in the
three-dimensional structure of molecular chains. The close packing
of the molecular chains increased the free volume of the polymer.
Finally, it is concluded that the microspheres were synthesized successfully.

2.2 Thermal Performance of PBa Composites
The thermal stabilities of PZAF/PBa and other composites were analyzed
by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in nitrogen atmosphere. The onset
degradation temperature (Tonset) and the
maximum degradation temperature (Tmax)
are the temperatures corresponding to 5% mass loss and maximum mass
loss rate of samples, respectively. The TGA results are shown in Figure 3 and Table 1. In, Figure 3a,b pure PBa showed only one-stage of weight
loss between 350 and 450 °C in N2 and 31.5 wt % residue
at 700 °C. This was mainly due to the degradation of phenols
and amines in PBa chains during combustion. Introduction of PZAF into
PBa caused an increase in char residue at 700 °C, which was ascribed
to the random dispersion of PZAF forming a cross-linked network structure.
This structure prevented the release of degradation products. Moreover,
the composites displayed a two-stage decomposition pattern: the first
stage between 300 and 350 °C and second stage between 400 and
500 °C. The first step is the result of breaking of PBa chains.
The second step resulted mainly from the further thermal degradation
of phosphate groups. However, the Tonset and Tmax values were slightly reduced
because of the formation of phosphoric acid and its phosphate derivatives,
which further accelerated the decomposition of PZAF/PBa composites.

and DTG (b,d) curves of pure PBa and its composites in
nitrogen.

the composite.

The TGA and DTG curves of other microspheres and their
composites
are shown in Figure 3c,d. The residues at 700 °C in PZS/PBa-5%, PZFP/PBa-5%, and
PZPT/PBa-5% composites were 39.2, 34.1, and 40.6%, respectively, which
were slightly higher than that of pure PBa. It was evident that the
addition of microspheres led to better thermal stability. Interestingly,
the residue at 700 °C for PZPT/PBa-5% composite was highest among
all composites. Probably, the high cross-link density of PZPT microspheres
increased the rigidity of the polymer, which in turn increased the
thermal stability of the material. From Table 1, the calculated residue at 700 °C was
less, compared with the actual residue at 700 °C. The blending
between the microspheres and resin was not simple, and the interaction
between them helped to improve the high-temperature thermal stability
of the polymer. After adding microspheres, the experimental determination
of the residual amount was significantly higher than the theoretical
calculation, indicating that the microspheres promote PBa cross-linking
char formation.30

2.3 Flammability Performance of PBa and Its Composites
Flammability properties of the polymers, which are very important
for assessment of flammability of various materials, were determined
using a cone calorimeter (CONE). Figure 4 shows the curves for the heat release rate
(HRR) and total heat release (THR) of PZAF/PBa composites. The results,
including time to ignition (TTI), peak of HRR (PHRR), THR, peak smoke
production rate (PSPR), and the fire growth rate index (FIGRA) are
summarized in Table S1 (see the Supporting Information).

Figure 4 HRR (a) and THR (b) curves of PBa and PZAF/PBa composites in CONE
test.

From Figure 4a,
the PHRR of pure PBa was found to be 653.3 kW/m2. The PHRR
value of PBa apparently decreased on the addition of PZAF. Hence,
the PHRR values of PZAF/PBa-5% and PZAF/PBa-10% were 245.2 and 237.4
kW/m2, with a reduction of 62.5 and 63.7%, respectively.
The PHRR values of PZAF/PBa composites decreased gradually with the
increase in loading of PZAF. Generally, a lower PHRR implies better
fire performance. However, the decreasing trend of PHRR became less
and less obvious. In short, the fire performance of PBa composites
did not always increase by increasing the content of polyphosphazene
microspheres. Moreover, in Figure 4b, the THR of PBa composites exhibited a decreasing
trend similar to that of PHRR. For example, the THR of PZAF/PBa-5%
showed 24.7% reduction. The introduction of PZAF could reduce the
fire hazard because PZAF acted as physical barrier, preventing the
exposure of the internal material to fire. Figure S1 (see the Supporting Information) also shows a trend similar
to those of PHRR and THR of PZS/PBa composites. The reduction of PHRR
and THR values, considered as the factors most responsible for reducing
fire hazards, are significant. This is ascribed to similarities in
the bisphenol structures of BPAF and 4,4′-sulfonyldiphenol
(BPS).

Furthermore, the flammability properties of other composites
were
also evaluated and presented in Figure 5. The peaks in HRR curves of all PBa composites, with
5 wt % loading of polyphosphazene microspheres, were small. The PHRR
and THR values of PZAF/PBa composites with the same additive content
reached a minimum value, indicating the higher fire safety of PZAF/PBa
composites. This explains that the above statement on PHRR and THR
values is attributed to the difference in the chain structures of
the polyphosphazene microspheres. The other reason is the compatibility
between the polyphosphazene microspheres and substrates. From Figure 6, the CO production
rate (COP) and smoke production rate (SPR) of flame-retarded PBa composites
were lower than that of pure one. Specially, introduction of 20 wt
% PZS to PBa significantly reduces the PSPR value, which is decreased
from 0.34 to 0.17 m2/s with a reduction of 50%. The reduction
of COP would create conditions for safe evacuation. During the combustion
process, polyphosphazene microspheres formed a carbon layer with the
matrix, which hindered the transfer of heat between the interior of
composite and air, thereby reducing smog of the PBa composite material.

Figure 5 HRR (a)
and THR (b) curves of flame-retardant composites in CONE
test.

Figure 6 COP (a,c) and SPR (b,d) curves of flame-retardant composites
in
CONE test.

It was evident from Table S1 that the
ignition time of pure PBa resin was longer than those of the PBa composites.
This was due to the rapid softening of pure PBa resin. This resulted
in an increase in the distance between the burned surface and heater
during the burning process, causing reduction in heating efficiency.
Meanwhile, it was expected that the loading of flame retardants would
increase the viscosity and thermal conductivity of the neat polymers,31 resulting in shortening of TTI. In addition,
the increased melt viscosity would also significantly reduce the HRR,
which was consistent with the changes of HRR.32 It is well known that the main purpose of a flame retardant is not
to prevent the ignition of the polymer but to minimize the rate of
spreading of flame and prevent or avoid sustained burning. The FIGRA,
which is calculated from the ratio of PHRR/the time to PHRR, is very
useful to evaluate the contribution of a material to fire33 The FIGRA values of PBa composites were lower
than that of pure PBa, which showed that incorporation of flame retardants
could decrease the susceptibility of PBa resins to a fire. Compared
to that of pure PBa, the maximum FIGRA value of PZAF/PBa-5% decreased
from 5.03 to 1.58 kW/m2/s, indicating an excellent fire
safety performance.

2.4 Analysis of Flame Retardancy Mechanism
The microspheres used in this study have good flame retardancy. Considering
their properties and structures, PZAF/PBa and PZS/PBa microspheres
were selected for analyzing the mechanism of their flame retardancy
and dynamic thermomechanical properties.

2.4.1 Condensed Phase Analysis
To study
the flame-retardancy mechanism, the residual chars were characterized
by SEM–energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Figure 7a–c shows
the digital photographs of residues of pure PBa, PZAF/PBa-5%, and
PZS/PBa-5%. In Figure 7a, the residual char layer showed a cracked and incomplete surface.
In contrast to this, PZAF/PBa-5% and PZS/PBa-5% in Figure 7b,c displayed continuous, compact,
and denser char surfaces. Further, SEM images of the surfaces and
inner residual chars of pure PBa, PZAF/PBa-5%, and PZS/PBa-5% are
shown in Figure 8.
From Figure 8(a1,a2), it is seen that although pure PBa could form
an internal porous structure after combustion, its carbonized layer
had poor flexibility, insufficient toughness on the outer surface,
and cracks or faults. This fractured carbonized layer was fragile
and vulnerable to destruction and hence was less protective to CO
and CO2 gases and PBa pyrolysis fragments. However, Figure 8(b1,c1) shows dense surfaces that provided an effective barrier
to prevent the transfer of oxygen, heat, and mass between the burning
zone and inner unburnt area, thereby improving the flame-retardancy
performance. In Figure 8, (b2) shows the obturator char residues and (c2) shows the perforated char residues, which can explain the better
flame retardancy of PZAF than PZS.

PZAF/PBa-5%, and (c) PZS/PBa-5%.

Figure 8 SEM images of the residual char surfaces (a1–c1) and interior regions (a2–c2) of (a) pure PBa, (b) PZAF/PBa-5%, and (c) PZS/PBa-5%.

To further explain the contribution of PZFP in
flame retardancy
of benzoxazine resin, EDS was conducted, and the results are presented
in Figure 9. All of
the elements were derived from residue of PZAF/PBa-5%. Compared to
inner char, the P, O, and F contents of outer residue increased slightly.
The P and F elements were derived from polyphosphazene microspheres.
Lower contents of P and F are ascribed to the polyphosphazene microspheres
accumulating on the surface of the benzoxazine substrate to form a
protective carbon layer, which blocked the entry of oxygen during
the combustion process. EDS of outer char residues and inner char
residues of PZS/PBa-5% was provided in Figure S2 (see the Supporting Information). Because of the change
in the N content and synergistic effect between the phosphorus and
nitrogen elements, PZAF is superior to the flame-retardant efficiency
of PZS.

(b) inner residue.

2.4.2 Gas-Phase Analysis
In order to
directly distinguish the changes in peak intensities of the main pyrolysis
products at different temperatures, TGA/infrared spectrometry (TG/IR)
spectroscopy was employed to analyze the gases produced by PBa, PZAF/PBa-5%,
and PZS/PBa-5% during their thermal degradation. In Figures 10 and 11, PZAF/PBa-5% and PZS/PBa-5% appeared similar to pure PBa. As the
thermal decomposition progressed, water and amine-containing compounds
(3500–3800 cm–1), hydrocarbons (2900–3000
cm–1), CO2 (2350 cm–1), and aromatic compounds (1500–1750 cm–1), the main pyrolysis products of pure PBa, appeared.32,34 There was an early increase in the contents of water and amine-containing
compounds, methyl or methylene compounds, CO2, and aromatic
compounds compared to pure material, after the incorporation of microspheres.
This suggested that the microspheres played an important role in catalyzing
the thermal decomposition of PBa. For a more specific comparison of
pure PBa and PZFP/PBa-5% gas-phase components, the FTIR spectra of
gas-phase components at different temperatures were compared in detail
as shown in Figure 12. In addition to the common thermal degradation products mentioned
above, PZAF/PBa showed a small strengthened peak at around 1214 cm–1, which is due to the −P=O bond.35 The appearance of this peak indicated the presence
of phosphate and its derivatives, which could effectively capture
or terminate the free radicals in the gas phase, consequently delaying
the flame propagation. This demonstrated the flame-retardancy property
of PZAF.

temperatures.

2.4.3 Mechanism of Flame Retardant
As
shown in Scheme 1,
the significant reduction in the fire hazard of microspheres can be
ascribed to the gas-phase and condensed-phase action. On the one hand,
the cooperative catalytic carbonization effect of the microspheres
retards the escape of pyrolysis volatile. On the other hand, the well-dispersed
microspheres networks act as physical barrier to hinder the heat and
mass transfer and the release of degradation products, inhibit toxic
gases, and enhance flame retardancy.

of Mechanism for Flame Retardancy of Microspheres
in Flaming PBa Composites
2.5 Dynamic Thermomechanical Properties
The above analyses confirmed that the incorporation of microspheres
into the composites improved the fire properties of the composites.
However, the mechanical properties of polymers were expected to deteriorate
while catering to the requirements of flame retardancy.36 Thus, the thermal behaviors of the composites,
such as glass transition temperature (Tg), was determined by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). Figures 13 and 14 present the storage modulus (E) and loss angle tangent (tan δ) versus temperature, respectively,
of pure PBa, PZAF/PBa-5%, and PZS/PBa-5%. The images also showed changes
in dynamic thermomechanical properties after the introduction of microspheres
into Ba resin. From Figure 13, the storage moduli (E) of PZAF/PBa-5% and
PZS/PBa-5% were slightly higher than that of pure PBa at room temperature,
whereas the E values of pure PBa increased compared
to others when the temperature increased to almost Tg. It is well known that the dynamic mechanical properties
of cured resins are sensitive to their chemical structures and compositions.37 The storage modulus increased as a result of
restriction in the movement of the PBa segment due to rigidity.

Figure 13 Storage moduli
of the pure PBa, PZAF/PBa-5%, and PZS/PBa-5%.

Figure 14 tan δ values of pure PBa, PZAF/PBa-5%, and PZS/PBa-5%.

Generally, Tg of thermosetting
resins
is a crucial parameter for determining their scope of practical applications. Figure 14 shows single peaks
for PBa, PZAF/PBa-5%, and PZS/PBa-5% in the DMA spectra, with peak
values of 221, 208, and 210 °C, respectively. In short, the introduction
of microspheres decreased the Tg of benzoxazine
polymer. This was consistent with thermal analysis results, according
to which the addition of microspheres reduced the Tonset. This is ascribed to the presence of inert microspheres
in PBa composites that hindered the efficiency of ring-opening curing
cross-linking of Ba monomers when microspheres were introduced into
Ba monomer, resulting in decreased PBa cross-link density.38,39 The mobility of the segments increased, which caused a decrease
in Tg and storage modulus. The Tg values of PZAF/PBa-5% and PZS/PBa-5% were
still above 200 °C, which were higher than those of the traditional
thermosetting resins. Polyphosphazene microspheres had no significant
effects on the application temperature and working environment of
PBa.

3 Conclusions
In this work, various polyphosphazene
microspheres were successfully
fabricated by ultrasound-assisted condensation polymerization. All
four types of polyphosphazene microspheres synthesized showed good
flame-retardancy properties in the PBa matrix. The polyphosphazene
microspheres enhanced the char yields of PBa at 500–800 °C.
Moreover, the PZAF microspheres showed better flame retardancy, compared
to the other polyphosphazene microspheres. The PHRR value of PZAF/PBa-5%
decreased by 62.5%, compared with pure PBa, whereas PZS/PBa-5%, PZFP/PBa-5%,
and PZPT/PBa-5% showed reduction of 49.3, 55.8, and 56.6%, respectively.
The study of fire retardancy mechanism revealed a synergistic flame-retardancy
effect of polyphosphazene microspheres. They catalyzed the thermal
degradation of PBa into char in the condensed phase and promoted the
decomposition in gas phase to produce more nonflammable gases. The
DMA analysis showed that the Tg of PBa
composites still was sufficiently high. Based on these results, it
is clear that of the synthesized polyphosphazene microspheres can
potentially increase the scope of application of PBa in fire protection
and other fields.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
BPS, HCCP, PT, and BPAF
were procured by Chengdu Best Reagents Co. Ltd. (China). Acetonitrile,
trimethylamine (TEA), ethanol, and acetone were purchased from Chengdu
Kelong Chemical Reagent Factory (China). 4,4′-(9-Fluorenylidene)diphenol
was purchased from Chengdu Point Pure Technology Co. Ltd. (China).
Ba was supplied by Sichuan Tiance Jucai Technology Co. Ltd. All reagents
were of analytical grade and were used directly, unless otherwise
specified.

4.2 Synthesis of Polyphosphazene Microspheres
A typical protocol for the preparation of polyphosphazene microspheres
involves one-step precipitation copolymerization. The representative
synthesis of PZAF microspheres is shown in Scheme 2. HCCP (0.4 g, 1.15 mmol) and BPAF (1.16
g, 3.45 mmol) were dissolved sequentially in 100 mL of acetonitrile
in a 250 mL round-bottom flask. The system was stirred ultrasonically
(250 W, 40 kHz) for 10 min. Then, TEA (4 mL) was added to the above
system, and the flask was sealed immediately. The stirring was continued
under ultrasonication for further 4 h. Meanwhile, the temperature
was maintained precisely at 50 °C. Thereafter, the resultant
product was obtained by centrifugation, followed by washing sequentially
thrice with anhydrous ethanol, acetone, and deionized water. Finally,
the solid product was dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 12
h.

Scheme 2 Route for the Synthesis of Microspheres
A similar procedure was employed for the syntheses
of PZS, PZFP,
and PZPT. The structures of bisphenol monomers are displayed in Figure 15.

4.3 Preparation of PBa and Its Flame-Retardant
Composites
A typical process for the preparation of the PBa
composite with 5 wt % of the flame-retardant material is as follows:
PZAF (4 g) was dispersed in acetone by sonication for 30 min. Then,
Ba (76 g) was introduced under continuous mechanical stirring. Subsequently,
acetone was removed at 60–120 °C under low pressure. Thereafter,
the mixture containing PZAF and Ba was cured at 180 °C for 2
h and then at 200 °C for 2 h. After curing, the sample was cooled
down to room temperature naturally. The final composite was designated
as PZAF/PBa-5%. PBa flame-retardant composites were all prepared by
similar procedures. PBa without the addition of polyphosphazene microspheres
was prepared as the contrast sample. The ratios of PBa, PZAF, PZS,
PZFP, and PZPT are all presented in Table S2 (see the Supporting Information).

4.4 Characterization
SEMs and EDS were
performed on ZEISS EV0 MA15 transmission electron microscope (Carl
Zeiss Micro Image Co. Ltd). TGA was performed on SDTA85e thermo-analyzer
instrument (Mettler Toledo, Switzerland) under a nitrogen atmosphere
at a heating rate of 20 °C/min from 40 to 800 °C. TG/IR
was conducted on a PerkinElmer STA6000 thermogravimetric analyzer,
which was connected to a PerkinElmer FTIR spectrophotometer through
a stainless steel transfer pipe. The fire performances of PBa and
its composites were evaluated by CONE tests (Fire Testing Technology,
UK), according to ASTM E1354/ISO 5660 standard. Each specimen was
exposed horizontally under a heat flux of 35 kW/m2. The
storage moduli and tangent loss angles of materials were investigated
by dynamic thermomechanical analysis using a Q800 analyzer (TA instruments)
in three-point bending mode with sample dimensions of 40 × 10
