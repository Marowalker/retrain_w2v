Photosynthesis
is the model system for energy conversion. It uses
CO2 as a starting reactant to convert solar energy into
chemical energy, i.e., organic molecules or biomass. The first and
rate-determining step of this cycle is the immobilization and activation
of CO2, catalyzed by RuBisCO enzyme, the most abundant
protein on earth. Here, we propose a strategy to develop novel biomimetic
two-dimensional (2D) nanostructures for CO2 adsorption
at room temperature by reductionist mimicking of the Mg–carboxylate
RuBisCO active site. We present a method to synthesize a 2D surface-supported
system based on Mg2+ centers stabilized by a carboxylate
environment and track their structural dynamics and reactivity under
either CO2 or O2 exposure at room temperature.
The CO2 molecules adsorb temporarily on the Mg2+ centers, producing a charge imbalance that catalyzes a phase transition
into a different configuration, whereas O2 adsorbs on the
Mg2+ center, giving rise to a distortion in the metal–organic
bonds that eventually leads to the collapse of the structure. The
combination of bioinspired synthesis and surface reactivity studies
demonstrated here for Mg-based 2D ionic networks holds promise for
the development of new catalysts that can work at room temperature.

Introduction
For almost 3 billion
years, nature has developed fantastic methods
to convert solar energy to fuels in a way that humans are trying to
replicate. This process is called photosynthesis,1 which occurs in two steps: the light reactions (which require
light) and carbon fixation (also known as the dark reaction or Calvin
cycle). Up to now, there exists only a single conversion technology
with prospects for long-term large-scale use: photovoltaics.2,3 In a photovoltaic cell, photons are absorbed and converted to electrical
energy (light reaction). This leads to electric currents that have
to be used immediately. Pursuing the long-term goal of direct fuel
production from solar energy requires mimicking the other part of
photosynthesis, conversion of CO2 (dark reaction).

However, activating CO2 and, more importantly, converting
it to fuels is notoriously difficult due to the high stability of
the CO2 molecule, which imposes significant energy demands
and requires high-temperature/pressure conditions and/or active reductants,
such as hydrogen.4−6 Alternatively, solid-state catalysts are needed.
The vast majority of the autotrophs in nature fixate the inorganic
carbon atom from CO2 to produce sugars, during the dark
reaction of photosynthesis, with an enzyme as catalyst: the Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate
carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO, Figure 1a). This macroprotein is the most abundant protein
in the biosphere. The active center of the RuBisCO is a Mg2+ ion surrounded by amino acid residues whose functions are to anchor
the ribulose and provide the CO2 as a cofactor bound to
a lysil residue in the surroundings of the Mg2+ (Figure 1a).7 At lower levels of CO2, O2 molecules
compete with CO2. This competition consumes extra energy
and, eventually, liberates CO2. Thus, the enzyme is considered
inefficient and motivates scientists to investigate ways to improve
the enzymatic function of RuBisCO.

active center.40 (b) Scanning tunneling
microscopy (STM) image

(RT). The inset shows the structural model of the fully deprotonated
molecules arranged in a typical 3 × 3 configuration (Vbias = 1.122 V; i = 70 pA).
(c) An STM image showing the structure formed by the co-deposition

by the circular motifs whereas Mg, represented in the model by green
circles, appears as circular protrusions between three TPA molecules.
NB: the apparent height (brightness) of the Mg atoms depends on the
tip conditions (see Figure S2).

Metal–organic networks (MONs) are structures
that resemble
well the basic configuration of metalloenzymes.8 They consist of metal nodes bound to organic bridging ligands
that self-assemble on a metal substrate. These nanoarchitectures hold
great potential in heterocatalysis due to the tunability of their
metal centers,9−11 organic linker, pore size,12,13 and physical/chemical properties.14−18 Even though many MONs were reported, the study of
their catalytic properties with respect to gas adsorption is still
in its infancy. Nevertheless, we consider that there is a critical
mass of knowledge to attempt the inversion of the structure–function
relationship. Our approach is then to apply the nanoarchitectonic
principles learnt in the past two decades to start building structures
that could resemble the architecture of the active site of known enzymes.8,19 This approach promises to provide a playground where an atomistic
insight into the relevant processes can be achieved, and, ultimately,
it will allow us to create new bioinspired catalysts that could work
at room temperature (RT). Moreover, the high level of control of the
coordination environment allows us to evaluate separately the contribution
of each functional group to the reactivity of the center.

Molecules
with carboxylic functional groups (R-COOH) can work as
excellent building blocks in the design of molecular nanostructures.20 One characteristic is the deprotonation of COOH
into a carboxylate group (COO–) on solid surfaces
at RT, which confers them the ability to form robust metal–organic
networks with co-deposited transition17,18,21−24 as well as alkali metal atoms.25−28 Terephthalic acid (1,4-benzenedicarboxylic
acid, TPA) is a model molecule that easily deprotonates on Cu surfaces
at RT and eventually forms metal–organic networks with co-deposited
adatoms.17 A second characteristic is in regard to the
oxygen atoms from its COO– anions acting in the
networks as electron acceptors,29 which
allow the control of the redox potential in the metal centers.17,30 This particular feature encourages the use of metal–organic
networks for O2 dissociation,8,30,31 aimed to resemble the catalytic function of enzymes
specialized in O2 reduction.32,33

The
adsorption of CO2 was recently explored on 2D metal–organic
networks. One of the few examples involves the use of metal–organic
chains of 1,4-phenylene diisocyanide molecules bound to Au adatoms
on Au(111), to promote CO2 capture at 77 K.34,35 Moreover, networks formed by molecules with carboxylate groups bound
to Fe centers have shown adsorption of CO2 at 100 K.36 Nevertheless, so far, no CO2-driven
phase transition has been reported at RT for any 2D metal–organic
array.

Herein, inspired by the structure of the active site
in the RuBisCO
enzyme, we present a method to replicate the carboxylate environment
around a Mg2+ ion. For this purpose, we designed an ionic
network with Mg2+ as active centers by the self-assembly
of TPA molecules with Mg atoms deposited on Cu(100) at RT. Finally,
in the attempt to test the catalytic function of these bioinspired
complexes, high partial pressures of CO2 and O2 are exposed on the system at RT. The stability and chemical changes
in the network related to gas adsorption are studied by complementary
techniques such as scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), high-resolution
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HR-XPS), and first principles density
functional theory (DFT) calculations.

Results and Discussion
Formation
of Mg-TPA Networks on Cu(100)
The main goal
of this work is to mimic the catalytic function of the active site
of the RuBisCO enzyme through the fabrication of 2D ionic networks
with Mg2+ centers. Surface science studies have demonstrated
that the catalytic activity of metal particles is boosted when they
are reduced to single atoms,37 as the coordination
number decreases. Furthermore, organic molecules can coordinate adatoms
from a metal surface, controlling the chemical environment around
single atoms and their distribution, leaving apical orbitals ready
to react with new species. This characteristic makes them good candidates
to study their potential in heterogeneous catalysis. The first step
in the strategy toward the formation of ionic networks with Mg adatoms
consists in the formation of a self-assembled layer of the organic
linkers. TPA molecules (coverage = 0.4 ML) were deposited on an atomically
clean Cu(100) surface at RT. Earlier studies have reported that TPA
molecules deprotonate and self-assemble on a Cu surface at RT.38,39 Indeed, the typical STM image of this system (Figure 1b) shows a homomolecular patch of TPA forming
a 3 × 3 phase structure (with respect to the underlying Cu surface)
related to the self-assembly of fully deprotonated molecules.38,39

The second step consists in the co-deposition of sub-ML coverages
of Mg atoms and TPA molecules on an atomically clean Cu(100) surface
at RT (Figure 1c).
The deposition process was finalized with postannealing at 353 K for
5 min to favor the diffusion of the species on the surface. STM images
(Figures 1c and S1) reveal the formation of a new structure incorporating
single Mg atoms coordinated to three TPA molecules. Larger area images
also show the presence of larger Mg clusters (bright circular protrusions)
surrounded by TPA molecules (Figure S1-a). As we shall see, the presence of Mg clusters also agrees with
XPS analysis in the Mg 2p region. Figure 1c shows that the molecules in the ordered
islands get grouped in consecutive trigonal-planar arrangements, suggesting
an electrostatic coordination to Mg2+. The model superposed
(obtained by DFT calculations) presents a structure based on a Mg2+ ion, represented as a green solid circle, coordinated by
three TPA molecules through their carboxylate moieties. Two types
of Mg–carboxylate coordination are present: one TPA with a
bidentate carboxylate coupling to Mg, and two TPA carboxylates interacting
via a monodentate coordination with Mg. From now on, this structure
will be referred as Mg-3TPA. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first 2D metal–organic architecture that incorporates an
alkaline earth metal atom (group 2) as a metal center.

A more
precise configuration of the Mg-3TPA structure is described
by DFT calculations. The calculations were performed using the Vienna
ab initio simulation package (VASP),41,42 including
van der Waals (vdW) interaction within the vdW-dF scheme. Due to the
large unit cell and the consequential computational overcharge, one
monolayer of the Cu(100) surface with Cu atoms in fixed positions
was included in the calculations, whereas the rest of the atoms forming
the organic overlayer were allowed to relax until forces were smaller
than 0.05 eV/Å. Tests including two substrate layers indicate
a negligible (no more than a 2%) change in the vertical distances
as compared with the calculations with a monolayer of the Cu substrate
(see Figure S3 and Table S1). As a result,
a relaxed Mg-3TPA ionic network was obtained on top of a Cu(100) layer.
A Bader charge analysis43,44 revealed the ionic
character of Mg and O atoms due to the rearrangement of charge in
the system. As seen in Figure 2a, for modeling the surface, a (10 × 5) unit cell was
considered and the overlayer consists of two Mg atoms that lay at
almost bridge positions on top of the surface, each of them coordinated
with four O atoms from three different TPA molecules, i.e., six TPA
molecules in total. The vertical distances from the atoms of the overlayer
to the Cu surface vary from 1.96 Å the closest to 3.40 Å
the largest. The two TPA units that are aligned with the [100] crystallographic
direction get tilted around 7° and are anchored to the surface
by the non-coordinated COO– group, whereas the other
two diagonal TPA units adopt an arched conformation. In agreement
with the crystallographic database for the average bond distance in
Mg–carboxylate networks,45 the O–Mg
distances for the monodentate and bidentate coordination are 2.03
and 2.20 Å, respectively. In addition, each TPA molecule forms
H bonds (O···H–C) between two of their uncoordinated
carboxylate moieties and the aromatic rings from adjacent molecules.
To visualize the flux of charge due to the formation of the metal–organic
compound, the electronic charge density difference is depicted in Figure 2b. The remarkable
charge depletion (red) on the Mg positions and the charge accumulation
(blue) in the O atoms that interact with the Mg adatom observed in Figure 2b represent a fingerprint
of the ionic character of the complex formed. To confirm the reliability
of the model, the Tersoff–Hamann approach46,47 was used to simulate STM images of a typical Mg-3TPA network (Figure 2c). The simulation
was based on the integration of spatially resolved density of states
in energy, from a certain applied bias potential (−2.0 eV)
to the Fermi level. This simulation reproduced the zigzagging inversely
ordered trigonal-planar arrangements seen in the experimental STM
images of the Mg-3TPA network (see the combined image at the center
of Figure 2c).

network on top of a Cu(100) layer calculated by means of DFT. The

different TPA molecules. (b) Electronic density difference of the

The chemical identity
of TPA (Figure 3a)
and Mg-3TPA (Figure 3b) networks on Cu(100) was confirmed by HR-XPS
spectra. The XPS spectrum in the C 1s region of the reference system
shows the typical profile of a homomolecular network containing fully
deprotonated TPA molecules: an intense peak at 284.6 eV is attributed
to the carbon atoms from the phenyl ring (6C), and a small peak at
287.6 eV, characteristic of carboxylate groups (−COO–).38 The dotted peak at 285.1 eV could
be related to the different chemical environment around the aromatic
carbons.38 The 3 × 3 structure is
also confirmed by the analysis of the XPS spectrum in the O 1s region,
which contains a single peak at 531.3 eV attributed to carboxylate
oxygens (−COO–).

the C 1s and O 1s binding energy regions
of the homomolecular 3 × 3 phase of fully deprotonated TPA species
on Cu(100). (b) HR-XPS spectra for a typical ionic network prepared
by the co-deposition of TPA molecules and Mg atoms on Cu(100). The
core level shifts in the C 1s and O 1s regions evidence the electrostatic
interaction between Mg2+ and TPA species.

The shifts of the peaks in every spectrum in Figure 3b suggest an interaction
between the co-deposited
TPA molecules and Mg adatoms. On the one hand, the main peaks of the
C 1s and O 1s binding energy regions in the network formed by the
co-deposition of TPA molecules and Mg adatoms on Cu(100) (Figure 3b) are shifted toward
higher binding energies, compared to those obtained for the TPA homomolecular
network. Similar core level shifts were already reported as related
to TPA molecules acquiring a protonated character on Cu(100).38 However, TPA molecules are fully deprotonated
under the present deposition conditions. Therefore, the protonated
character of the negatively charged COO– groups
would be endowed by the Mg2+ cations, thus evidencing the
formation of ionic networks. The detailed analysis in the C 1s region
reveals a small peak at higher binding energies (289.4 eV), attributed
to the electrostatic interaction between the COO– group and the Mg2+ cations and an intense single peak
at 285.2 eV, attributed to the 6C ring of the fully deprotonated TPA
species interacting with Mg2+. The remarkable core level
shift to higher binding energies is associated to the charge migration
from the C atoms toward the oxygen atoms in COO–.25 In addition, the O 1s line shape shows
a dominant peak at 532.1 eV, related to a relative less negatively
charged COO– group due to the low electronic density
around the core electrons during the electrostatic COO––Mg2+ interaction.25 On the other hand, at lower energies, the Mg 2p binding energy region
shows a broad peak that can be split in two components: one feature
at 50.8 eV that reveals the presence of small Mg clusters on the surface
and a second peak at 51.4 eV in the region corresponding to the ionic
form of Mg (Mg2+).48−51 These two peaks suggest that TPA molecules sequestrate
Mg atoms from clusters to eventually form ionic networks with Mg2+ cations. This mechanism may occur in a similar way as seen
in ionic networks formed with alkali compounds.52

So far, we have described the formation of a 2D structure
(Mg-3TPA)
after the deposition of TPA molecules and Mg adatoms on Cu(100). This
structure is stabilized by the ionic interactions between the carboxylate
groups from TPA and the Mg2+ centers and resembles the
carboxylate environment of the Mg2+ ion present in the
active site of the RuBisCO enzyme. Next, we explore the catalytic
properties of these ionic networks for gas adsorption.

Reactivity
of 3 × 3 TPA and Mg-3TPA Ionic Networks with
CO2 and O2
To study the reactivity
of these assemblies, the 3 × 3 TPA and the Mg-3TPA adsorbed on
Cu(100) structures were exposed to 470 L of CO2 or 450
L of O2. In the case of the homomolecular TPA network,
STM images did not reveal any structural change neither when exposed
to CO2 nor O2, preserving the 3 × 3 structure
intact after gas exposure (Figure S4).
Thus, we conclude that the pure TPA network does not interact either
with CO2 or with O2. In fact, the molecular
network passivates and protects the Cu surface for oxidation, as oxygen
rows are only observed to grow in the bare Cu regions. To further
verify the lack of chemical changes that could be undetectable by
STM, HR-XPS experiments were also done. As shown in Figure S5, CO2 is not absorbed in bare Cu regions
at RT, as it cannot be detected in the C 1s and O 1s regions. Moreover,
the 6C and COO– signals in the C 1s region did not
show any variation compared with the sample before gas exposure (Figure S5), confirming that CO2 is
not adsorbed in the molecular phase. Conversely, the exposure to O2 molecules generates a peak at 529.7 eV characteristic of
O–2 species chemisorbed on bare Cu surfaces,53 whereas the peak at 531.3 eV remains at the
same energy, confirming that the COO– groups do
not react with O2. These experiments confirm that the TPA
molecular phase is unreactive under CO2 or O2 exposure and that O2 rows grow in the bare Cu areas,
as seen by STM (S4).

This control
experiment is important as proof of the formation of a reactive metal–organic
network for two main reasons. First, the use of the same conditions
to deposit TPA on Cu(100) at RT guarantees the full deprotonation
of the molecules because carboxylate oxygens bind and control the
redox potential of the metallic centers, and second, the unreactive
character of COO– groups against CO2 and
O2 is crucial to discard the possible role of these groups
as active centers when they self-assemble with Mg adatoms.

A
typical ionic network with a Mg-3TPA configuration was prepared
using the standard preparation process stated above. Figure 4a shows a series of consecutive
STM images taken on a specific area of the surface over different
periods of time. As seen in the first three images, the pristine Mg-3TPA
structure was tracked during a period of 67 min and no structural
changes were observed. Thus, the Mg-3TPA network was found suitable
to test its reactivity under these conditions. Afterward, the interaction
with CO2 was tracked during almost 2 h. The first image
(marked with a black border, snapshot with t = 0
min) represents the moment when CO2 is released on the
system. After only exposing 22 L of CO2 (10 min), the surface
area of the network decreases, providing the first evidence of reactivity.
Then, after 99 L of CO2 exposure (22 min), noticeable structural
changes appear, related to a significant decrease of the Mg-3TPA network
domain at the expense of a new phase forming at the bottom right side
of the snapshot. The new phase presents a different configuration
and it turns predominant after 256 L of CO2 (57 min). This
square-shaped structure organizes the molecules in a new motif: one
Mg adatom surrounded by four TPA molecules leading to the formation
of pores. From here on, this structure will be referred as Mg-4TPA.
This new square-symmetrical arrangement suggests one type of Mg–carboxylate
coordination: monodentate couplings (O–Mg) of the Mg center
with each TPA molecule.17 In addition,
each TPA molecule forms H bonds (O···H–C) between
two of their uncoordinated carboxylate moieties and the aromatic rings
from adjacent molecules (Figure 4b). The pores in the network are the result of the
convergence of four uncoordinated carboxylate oxygens from four TPA
molecules. After 473 L of CO2 (105 min), the coverage of
the predominant Mg-4TPA phase increases whereas the former Mg-3TPA
structure vanishes completely. Finally, the CO2 injection
was stopped and the images were tracked during the next 17 min to
observe whether or not the structure could reverse from a Mg-4TPA
to Mg-3TPA configuration. The last snapshot at 122 min shows the stability
of the Mg-4TPA structure with no signs of structural reversibility.
Therefore, this experiment demonstrated that CO2 catalyzed
a phase transition: from a Mg-3TPA to Mg-4TPA configuration. This
phase was also observed at high TPA/Mg ratios; in fact, Figure S6 shows pure TPA domains coexisting with
the Mg-4TPA phase.

Figure 4 (a) Snapshots taken from a time-lapsed sequence of STM
images for
a Mg-3TPA ionic network on Cu(100) before, during (images with a black
border), and after being exposed to CO2. An irreversible
structural change is observed: the Mg-3TPA network evolves to a Mg-4TPA
structure (Vbias = −1.057 V; i = 73 pA). (b) Sketch of the CO2–mediated
transition from Mg-3TPA to Mg-4TPA. The middle panel shows a top and
a side view of the Mg-3TPA model used to evaluate the local CO2 adsorption. DFT calculations show that the intermediate between
one structure and the other is based on the adsorption of a linear
CO2 molecule on the reactive Mg2+ center.

The structural changes observed
by STM images encouraged the use
of DFT calculations to study the local charge distribution in detail
when CO2 interacts with the ionic networks. Figure 4b shows that the presence of
CO2 distorts the local bonding in a Mg-3TPA structure.
CO2 adsorbs on the Mg2+ center in a linear configuration
related to a weak chemisorption, with charge transfer weaker than
that in a bent sp2 configuration that is normally related
to CO2 chemisorption,36 which
requires the formation of the anion. In our DFT calculations, the
adsorption energy of CO2 on the Mg-3TPA network is −0.69
eV. This does not correspond to a full chemisorption, but this interaction
seems to be strong enough to induce weakening of the bonds between
Mg2+ and the carboxylate oxygens from TPA, disrupting the
structure and inducing the binding of a fourth TPA to Mg2+ to form the Mg-4TPA structure (as seen after 22 min in Figure 4a). Many thorough
studies have been related to the CO2 adsorption on low-index
Cu surfaces. On Cu(100), Cu(110), and Cu(111), CO2 is physisorbed
in a linear configuration at rather low temperature (and desorbed
at 70–85 K) with adsorption energies in the ranges of 0.22–0.31
eV.54,55 In a former paper, Campbell et. al.56 indicate that the chemisorption of CO2 on a clean Mg(0001) single crystal is dissociative, resulting in
both surface oxide and carbonate species. Nevertheless, as we shall
see from our XPS spectra, no signs of carbonates and magnesium oxides
were detected during our experiments. Therefore, we conclude that
the calculated adsorption energy of CO2 on the Mg-3TPA
network (more than twice the adsorption energy of CO2 on
bare Cu surfaces) is enough to produce an electronic rearrangement
on the network, inducing a reconfiguration that triggers the formation
of a new structure. However, no evidence of CO2 dissociative
adsorption is detected.

A second experiment was done to study
the interaction of the ionic
networks also with O2 molecules. Again, consecutive STM
images were taken on a defined area on the surface over different
periods of time (Figure 5a). The first snapshot revealed the presence of the Mg-3TPA network
and this ionic network did not show any structural changes during
an interval of 30 min. The snapshots highlighted using a black border
correspond to consecutive STM images taken during the O2 exposition for a period of up to 2 h. The first structural change
is observed after the exposure of 27 L of O2 (6 min). The
ionic network begins to disassemble from its center and this tendency
continues while more O2 is released in the system. Hence,
after 171 L of O2 (38 min) is exposed, most of the Mg-3TPA
structure is disassembled. The disassembly is more evident after exposure
of 342 L of O2 (76 min), whereas the borders of the terraces
also present strong signals of oxidation. Finally, a fully disordered
structure is observed after exposure of 567 L of O2 (126
min). Contrary to the case of CO2 exposure, the structure
never shows reorganization into an ordered configuration. These observations
probe the direct interaction of O2 with the system, which
induces complete and irreversible disruption of the Mg-3TPA phase.
Due to the disruption of the Mg-3TPA phase, an incipient formation
of the 3 × 3 TPA phase is also observed together with the disordered
phase (S7-a).

Figure 5 (a) Snapshots from a
time-lapsed sequence of STM images for a TPA-Mg
ionic network on Cu(100) taken before and during (images with a black
border) O2 exposure, where the Mg-3TPA evolves to a disordered
molecular phase (Vbias = 1.189 V; i = 74 pA). (b) The interaction of O2 induces
the transition from Mg-3TPA to a disordered phase. The middle panel
shows the intermediate structure of the local adsorption of O2 obtained by DFT calculations.

As described previously, CO2 catalyzes phase transition
from Mg-3TPA to Mg-4TPA. In contrast, the phase transition of Mg-3TPA
to a disordered structure is rather specific to O2. To
study the local structure when O2 interacts with the Mg-3TPA
network, we performed DFT calculations showing the interactions of
O2 molecules on a Mg-3TPA network. The results showed that
O2 also binds nondissociatively through one of its oxygen
atoms to the Mg2+ center of the ionic network (Figure 5b). The absorption
energy of O2 on top of a Mg2+ ion in the Mg-3TPA
network was calculated to be −0.79 eV.

The interaction
of a metal in an O2-rich environment
leads to the formation of a metal oxide that implies the dissociation
of O2. The Cu(001) surface is the most reactive among the
low-index Cu surfaces to the adsorption and direct dissociation of
O2, as evidenced at various temperatures (even at 5 K).57 On the other hand, the Mg(0001) surface also
undergoes oxidation at RT, leading to the formation of MgO thin films
under exposure of O2 doses.51,58 Nevertheless,
it was also demonstrated by first principles calculations that O2 molecules can be incorporated into Mg adatoms by nondissociative
adsorption to produce MgO2 admolecules on a MgO(001) surface
with point defects.59 Thus, it is possible
that after O2 exposure, the uncovered Cu surface will undergo
oxidation (by dissociation of O2 molecules) and different
oxidized Mg species will be formed in the network by dissociative
and/or nondissociative interactions. Figure S7-b shows how O2 molecules react with the Cu substrate (only
when the surface is not fully covered by the Mg-3TPA network) and
form the well-known oxygen rows on Cu(100).60 Despite the fact that the DFT calculations are not conclusive (because
the absorption energy difference between the physisorption of CO2 and O2 in the network is lower than expected),
the calculated adsorption energy at the first step of the O2 interaction is in good agreement with the trend observed experimentally.
Therefore, the slightly higher adsorption energy obtained for O2 seems to be enough to generate a reconfiguration of the charge
around Mg2+ ions and to destabilize the COO––Mg2+ coordination leading to the dissociation
of the metal–organic network.

The chemistry of CO2 and O2 interaction with
the ionic networks was again contrasted using HR-XPS (Figure 6). As a reference, we included
the Mg-3TPA ionic network spectra before gas exposure (Figure 6a). After 945 L of CO2 exposure, XPS spectra do not show any significant change in the
Mg 2p, C 1s, and O 1s binding energy regions (Figure 6b) compared to those in the Mg-3TPA network
before exposure. As discussed above, CO2 physisorbs on
the Mg2+ center and it catalyzes a phase transition from
a Mg-3TPA into Mg-4TPA structure. Therefore, the slight difference
in the COO––Mg2+ coordination
between both structures may produce changes in the chemical environment
around Mg and O atoms. The Mg 2p region, shows an increment in the
relative peak area at 51.4 eV (COO––Mg2+) at the expense of the peak at 50.8 eV (Mg cluster with
few atoms). This fact probes the action of CO2 to enhance
the segregation of the remaining small Mg clusters into Mg adatoms,
which eventually coordinate with deprotonated TPA molecules to form
larger patches of ionic network. Indeed, the segregation of the Mg
clusters can be related to the joint action of CO2 and
deprotonated TPA molecules. It was shown above that fully deprotonated
TPA species can segregate the clusters into single atoms of Mg, whose
distribution on the surface is controlled by the COO––Mg2+ coordination. Thus, in contrast with ref (51), Mg atoms in the ionic
network promote only a weak physisorption of CO2, preventing
the formation of MgCO3.

Figure 6 HR-XPS spectra showing the C 1s, O 1s,
and Mg 2p binding energy
regions for a typical Mg-3TPA network before (a) and after being exposed
to 945 L of CO2 (b) and 500 L of O2 (c), respectively.

Concerning the peaks related to
C atoms from carboxylate (COO–) and phenyl (6C)
groups from the TPA molecules that
form COO––Mg2+ coordination, they
remain at 289.4 and 285.2 eV, respectively. Hence, the presence of
physisorbed (if any) species of CO2 is imperceptible. The
presence of absorbed CO2 is also elusive in the O 1s region
(Figure 6b). The difficulty
to identify the peaks related to CO2 leads considering
also the possibility that CO2 may have left the system.
Nevertheless, the consequences of the interaction of CO2 on the system could be detected in the O 1s region where the peak
at 532.2 eV (Mg2+–COO–) is slightly
shifted by about 0.1 eV to higher binding energies. This shift could
be related to the different coordination environment of the COO– oxygens present in the recently formed Mg-4TPA configuration.

Summing up, even though CO2 species cannot be observed
within the time resolution of our XPS measurements, STM images and
DFT calculations showed that the interaction of CO2 is
strong enough to reorganize the charge around Mg2+, hence
triggering a transition from Mg-3TPA to Mg-4TPA coordination. Thus,
the ensemble of the results obtained by STM, DFT, and XPS suggests
that CO2 interacts with the system through temporary physisorption
on Mg2+.

The chemistry of O2 adsorption
in the ionic networks
was also studied by HR-XPS. Figure 6c shows the Mg 2p, C 1s, and O 1s binding energy region
of a Mg-3TPA network after 500 L of O2 exposure. At first
sight, it can be observed that the main peaks are shifted to lower
binding energies compared with the Mg-3TPA network before O2 exposure. The O 1s binding energy region shows an intense peak at
lower binding energy (529.7 eV) related to the presence of oxidized
Cu, as a consequence of the reactivity of O2 with the bare
Cu(100) areas, as confirmed also by the oxygen rows present in the
STM image in Figure S7-b. However, the
reactivity of O2 with the ionic network is evidenced by
the broader peak arising at a higher binding energy, whose deconvolution
reveals two peaks at 531.1 and 531.6 eV. As studied by STM and DFT
above, O2 quenches the charge in the Mg2+ center
and consequently disrupts the COO––Mg2+ interactions. In fact, the peak at 531.1 eV is characteristic
of the COO– group of deprotonated TPA molecules
(see Figures SI and S2)38 and confirms the disassembling of the TPA molecules from
the ionic network. Accordingly, the peak at higher binding energy
resembles the peak characteristic of the oxidized Mg species.58

The disassembling of the TPA molecules
from the network is also
confirmed in the C 1s region. The prominent peak at lower binding
energies splits into two peaks: 284.6 and 285.2 eV, respectively.
The peak at 284.6 eV is attributed to C6-ring carbons in fully deprotonated
TPA molecules.38 This peak presents a higher
relative area compared with the smaller peak at 285.2 eV characteristic
of the ionic networks, whose presence evidences the remaining small
areas with the COO––Mg2+ coordination.
Hence, the broad peak at higher binding energies at 288.4 eV is attributed
to the wide range of contributions between the COO– groups from the free molecules surrounded in a disordered fashion.
Finally, the Mg 2p region, shows a broad peak at 50.6 eV attributed
to Mg-oxidized species. Its shift to a lower binding energy would
result from the effect of CuO on the substrate,61 in a similar way as seen with larger Mg clusters exposed
to O2. These results demonstrated that the O2 interaction induces the quenching of the charge without a complete
breakdown of the COO––Mg2+ coordination.
This implies that TPA molecules remain in a disordered configuration
but they do not completely segregate to form a homomolecular network
(in agreement with STM images, Figure 5a).

Conclusions
Inspired by the structure
of the active site of RuBisCO, we have
presented a method to synthesize a system based on a Mg2+ center stabilized by a carboxylate environment. Similar to the RuBisCO
enzyme, the catalytic activity of the system was tested under high
relative pressures of CO2 and O2 at RT. The
Mg2+ centers were provided by the evaporation of Mg atoms
on the surface. The full deprotonation of TPA molecules on Cu(100)
at RT has been found suitable to provide the carboxylate environment
around the center of Mg2+. The co-deposition of TPA molecules
with Mg atoms on Cu(100) at RT resulted in the formation of a 2D ionic
network. The structure was stabilized by the electrostatic interaction
between Mg2+ and TPA species. The unit cell is formed by
a single Mg2+ cation surrounded by three deprotonated TPA
molecules (Mg-3TPA). The ionic networks have shown structural evidences
of gas adsorption upon exposure to relative high-pressure doses of
CO2 or O2. Both CO2 and O2 were found to interact with the Mg+2 center. The CO2 molecules adsorb temporarily on Mg2+, producing
a charge imbalance that induced a phase transition into a different
configuration (Mg-4TPA), whereas O2 adsorbs on the Mg2+ center, giving rise to a distortion in the metal–organic
bonds that eventually leads to the collapse of the structure. In both
cases, the observed phase transitions showed that the ionic networks
favor gas adsorption at RT. The 2D ionic network presented herein
shows the potential of metal–organic coordination on surfaces
to mimic enzymes active sites and track structural changes in situ
under gas exposure by scanning probe microscopy, providing insight
on the surface reactivity of coordinated metal centers and holding
promise for the design of heterogeneous catalysts tailored down to
the atomic level.

Experimental Section
STM experiments
were performed in a homemade scanning tunneling
microscope operated under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions and repeated
in the Omicron STM available at the synchrotron. This is an important
experimental check to make sure that the networks we measured with
XPS are the same measured by STM. The XPS data were acquired in the
X-Ray beamline PEARL synchrotron facilities at the Paul Scherrer Institute
(PSI), Switzerland. The data for the Mg 2p, C 1s, and O 1s were acquired
with a beam energy of 160, 370, and 650 eV, respectively. The pass
energy of the analyzer was set to 20 eV. The spectra were referenced
using the Au 4f7/2 line at 84.1 eV. All experiments were
carried out under UHV (∼ 3 × 10–10 mbar)
at RT.

Substrate Preparation
A Cu(001) single crystal (Mateck)
is used as a substrate. The cleaning process was performed in the
UHV chamber with a base pressure of 5.0 × 10–10 mbar. The surface was cleaned by consecutive cycles of Ar+ sputtering (0.5 keV) and annealing at temperatures up to 810 K,
followed by a slow and gradual cooling down of the crystal to 313
K before starting with the next cleaning cycle.

Sample Preparation
1,4-Benzenedicarboxylic acid (TPA)
molecules (Fluka) were deposited by thermal evaporation from a quartz
crucible by heating it up to 448 K. During molecular deposition, the
pressure in the chamber was kept below 2.0 × 10–9 mbar while the temperature of the substrates was kept at RT. Before
deposition, the molecules were fully degassed.

Computational
Details
DFT calculations were carried out using the 5.4.4
version of VASP.42,62,63 For the description of electron–ion
interactions the projector-augmented wave method was employed, whereas
the Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof functional was used to describe exchange
and correlation within the generalized gradient approximation64 and optB88-vdW functional to describe the nonlocal
van der Waals interaction.65

The
periodic slab models include a Cu layer, the two nonequivalent
Mg-3(4)TPA units, and 15 Å of vacuum. A 2 × 2 × 1 Monkhorst-Pack
mesh is used to describe the unit cell, and the plane-wave energy
cutoff was 400 eV in all cases. To perform the relaxation of the Mg–organic
network on top of the Cu (001) surface, all atoms of the network were
relaxed until the forces were less than 0.05 eV/Å and a convergence
criterion of 10–4 eV was used for energy. However,
when the small reactants were included, only the latter and the corresponding
Mg center and the surrounding carboxylate groups were allowed to relax.

VESTA software66 was used to represent
the geometrical and electronically induced density models with output
data of the previous calculations. The STM simulation of the adsorbed
Mg-TPA on Cu(100) substrate in the Tersoff–Hamann approach
was done with WSxM software.67
