Colloidal
gels with various architectures and different types of
interactions provide a unique opportunity to shed light on the interplay
between microscopic structures and mechanical properties of soft glassy
materials. Here, we prepare acetylated cellulose nanofibrils with
2 degrees of substitution and make a structural and rheological characterization
of their hydrogels. Two-step yielding processes are observed in the
shear experiments, which allow us to deduce more precise knowledge
regarding localized structural changes of the fibrils. We separate
the viscoelastic response into two contributions: the establishment
of cross-linked clusters on a fibril level and the arrested phase
separation on a cluster level. We hypothesize that with the addition
of salt, the hydrogels exhibit different arrested states that are
identified as unable to access the thermodynamic equilibrium. Our
results highlight that the coexistence of gelation and glass transitions
are experimentally recognized in the hydrogels, with a global gelation
driven by a local glasslike arrest during spinodal decomposition.

Introduction
Cellulose nanoparticles
(CNPs), primarily including cellulose nanofibrils
(CNFs) and cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), have recently attracted
increasing attention with regard to their unique structural and mechanical
properties and their technological applications.1−3 CNPs can be
isolated from many cellulose resources using different preparation
methods. In comparison with CNCs, CNFs have a much larger aspect ratio
and are viewed as flexible particles that can deform and entangle
with each other. It was found that CNFs can form a viscoelastic hydrogel
even at a low concentration of 0.125 wt % via the specific interactions
that modulate fibril entanglement and bundling.4 The structural flexibility of CNFs makes them attractive
building blocks for guided assembly in the hydrogel construction,
which is crucial not only to give new insights for the design of CNF-based
functional materials but also as model systems for studying arrested
states in soft glassy materials that have been observed for different
types of systems including granular media, molecular materials, and
colloidal suspensions.5−11

CNFs usually possess flocculated nature because of the vast
hydroxyl
groups in them, which promote the formation of hydrogen bonds among
the fibrils. Chemical or physical treatments are often performed to
introduce strong anionic or cationic charge on the surface,12−15 which builds up electrostatic repulsion between the fibrils with
the same charges and hinder hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions.
The coexistence of repulsion and attraction controls the degree of
entanglement and bundling of the fibrils. Thus, slow and arrested
states in CNF gels can have multiple origins.

Rheological characterization
has proven to be a promising approach
for studying the underlying physical principals in CNF gels.16−21 In general, at least two types of CNF gels should be distinguished
depending on their production methods: mechanical fibrillation without
enzymatic pretreatment produces suspensions with flocculated structures,
whereas mechanical fibrillation with chemical modification produces
suspensions with better colloidal stability.16 CNFs are known to have a complex entangled network and the flocculation
behavior under shear flow was studied in several works.22−24 During the rheological measurement, the suspension structure was
monitored through a transparent outer cylinder with a digital camera.
Karppinen et al.22 related different kinetics
for the breaking and formation of fibril flocs to the origin of their
rheological observation. The flocculated network structure was separated
firstly into loose flocs and further into individual spherical flocs
with increasing shear rate. At the same time, the flow curves displayed
some sudden slope changes, which were related to inhomogeneous flow
such as wall slip and shear banding.23 The
flow instabilities occur due to depletion of the fibrils near geometry
boundaries, which creates a lubrication layer. The flow instabilities
will introduce errors and difficulties in the result interpretation.
Hence, their influence should be minimized while performing the rheological
measurements.24

Until now, most of
the studies have focused on the determination
of storage and loss moduli under small amplitude oscillatory shear
and viscosity under shear flow.16 The highly
complex and heterogeneous CNF networks make it difficult to identify
the deformation modes and the dominating length scales. Recently,
the importance of the contribution of nonlinear behavior under large
amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS), which is very sensitive to the
formation of shear-induced microstructures, has been recognized in
understanding the stress–strain relation of colloidal suspensions.25 The nature of the arrested dynamics transition
can vary from bonded gels with heterogeneous fractal structures to
caged glasses with homogeneous amorphous structures. In this context,
the complex rheological properties of CNF gels may be rationalized
in terms of their structure, inhomogeneous character, and local density.
It is intriguing to consider whether the evolution of their structural
and dynamical properties is fundamentally related based on a common
set of physical processes (gelation and glass transitions). However,
no attempt has been performed so far to test the relevance of the
scenario for CNF gels, which have the potential to integrate the different
experimental results of CNF systems.

Here, we develop an efficient
approach to design stable water-dispersible
CNFs by surface acetylation combined with high-pressure homogenization.
The structural variability of the networks is achieved not only by
a significant change in fibril morphology but also by the extent of
fibril entanglement driven by both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions
within and between the fibrils. We are interested in exploring a structure–mechanics
relationship of the CNF gels using characterization techniques operating
at different length scales such as rheology, confocal laser scanning
microscopy (CLSM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and small-angle
X-ray scattering (SAXS). We probe the changes in internal structures
and mechanical properties of the gels as a function of acetylation
degree and salt concentration. We thereby obtain more precise knowledge
regarding the change in hierarchical structures and separate their
contributions to the mechanical response of the gels. Our multiscale
study sheds light on the role of dynamical arrest in the construction
of the CNF gels, which is critical to provide new insights for the
design of CNF biomaterials.

Results and Discussion
Above a critical
gelation concentration, CNFs can entangle and
bundle to form self-supporting networks with the ability to trap water,
that is, to form hydrogels. The hydrogels prepared from the different
acetylated CNFs (CNF0, CNF1.32, and CNF2.01) according to their degrees
of substitution (DS) at a concentration of 2 wt % but increasing the
NaCl concentration from 0 to 100 mM are presented in the Figure 1. The gels are macroscopically
homogeneous over 2 weeks without phase separation, except for the
occurrence of visible sedimentation for the CNF0 gel at high ionic
strength. It is obvious that the concentration is large enough to
enable the formation of a stable percolating network throughout the
volume of the vial. The gels are observed to become less turbid with
increasing DS. The different network stability of the CNF gels is
expected to depend on the structural characteristics of the fibrils.
We suggest that the long fibrils are kinetically trapped in a network
structure before the sedimentation takes place. The examined CNFs
dispersed in water exhibit a negative surface charge (Supporting Information, Table S1), which may
be acquired because of preferential adsorption of hydroxyl ions.27 The coexistence of electrostatic repulsion and
hydrophobic attraction controls the aggregate degree of the fibrils.
The surface charge is screened, and the zeta potential decreases with
increasing NaCl concentration, and hence, the electrostatic repulsion
between the fibrils becomes less intense. The sedimentation of the
CNF0 at high ionic strength may be initiated by an extremely high
coacervation process.

Figure 1 Stability of 2 wt % hydrogels of acetylated CNFs with
different
degrees of substitution (CNF0, CNF1.32, and CNF2.01) at different
NaCl concentrations (0, 10, and 100 mM) after preparation for 2 weeks.
Note that the gels are macroscopically homogeneous over 2 weeks without
phase separation, except for the occurrence of visible sedimentation
for the CNF0 at high ionic strength.

To gain insight into how the acetylation can influence the
fibril
arrangement, TEM was employed to image local fibril morphology. As
shown in Figure 2,
very few single fibrils are found, and the fibrils always appear to
be connected to neighboring counterparts. The micrographs indicate
that the CNF0 can organize into very straight bundles with an average
fibril diameter of 9.02 nm, whereas the CNF1.32 and CNF2.01 form cross-linked
clusters with average fibril diameters of 7 and 4.34 nm, respectively.
It seems that the CNF0 is strongly interacted and behaves effectively
as a thicker unit with the fibrils glued together. The OH-group-mediated
hydrogen bonds on the fibril surface may play a significant role in
the lateral alignment along the long axis within the bundles. The
decrease in the diameter of the fibrils with increasing DS may be
responsible for reducing their stiffness and affecting their cross-linking
density by association of the hydrophobic groups.

Figure 2 TEM images of acetylated
CNFs with different degrees of substitution
(CNF0, CNF1.32, and CNF2.01). The CNF0 looks very straight and can
organize into bundles, whereas the CNF1.32 and CNF2.01 form cross-linked
clusters.

The internal buildup of the fibrils
was also analyzed by SAXS,
and the log–log plots of scattered intensity (I) versus scattering vector (q) is shown in Figure 3. In the high q range, the obtained curves seemingly superimpose, but
in the low q range, the scattering intensity decreases
with increasing DS (Figure 3a). The fractal dimension of the clusters is obtained from
the slope of the plot. The fractal dimensions are 1.73, 1.64, and
1.29 for CNF0, CNF1.32, and CNF2.01, respectively, which confirms
that the propensity of the CNFs to form a bundle is decreased with
increasing DS. Moreover, the SAXS curves are almost superimposed with
increasing NaCl concentration (Figure 3b), showing that the networks are formed with the same
building blocks. The result suggests that the formation of clusters
at the nanoscale remains unaffected regardless of the NaCl concentration.
It also highlights the importance of the assembly processes that occur
at larger length scales. Figure 4 shows representative images of 2 wt % CNF networks
using CLSM with varying NaCl concentrations from 0 to 100 mM. At 0
mM NaCl, it is more probable to form random cross-linking points between
two fibrils, leading to small loose clusters with irregularity in
their structure as evidenced in the CLSM images. With increasing NaCl
concentration, more tightly bound clusters become visible in an otherwise
largely heterogeneous network. It is apparent that the salt addition
triggers an abrupt density fluctuation in the gels, leading to dense
cluster regions by spinodal decomposition.

CNF2.01, 10 mM NaCl. (f) CNF2.01, 100 mM NaCl. The salt addition triggers
an abrupt density fluctuation in the gels leading to dense cluster
regions by spinodal decomposition.

The above structural changes certainly affect rheological
properties
of the CNF gels. The dependence of steady shear viscosity on the shear
rate at 25 °C for 2 wt % CNF (CNF1.32 and CNF2.01) gels is shown
in Figure 5. At 0 mM
NaCl, the viscosities monotonically decrease as the shear rate increases
over the whole investigated ranges, exhibiting a typical single-region
shear-thinning behavior (Figure 5a). The viscosities of the gels with the addition of
NaCl are significantly different from those at 0 mM NaCl, with the
occurrence of a small extent of shear thickening at a shear rate of
about 10 s–1 (Figure 5b,c). The shear thickening may be attributed to a cluster
formation with stress overshooting which produces increased association
between the fibrils. Finally, at higher shear rates, the densified
clusters are eroded and separated into individual fibrils.

Figure 5 Steady shear
viscosity as a function of shear rate from 0.1 to
100 s–1 for 2 wt % hydrogels of CNF1.32 and CNF2.01
at NaCl concentrations of (a) 0, (b) 10, and (c) 100 mM.

The oscillatory sweep measurements were performed,
and the storage
modulus (G′) and loss modulus (G″) are recorded as a function of strain amplitude (γ)
or frequency (f). Figure 6 shows the dependence of G′ and G″ over a wide range of strain
amplitudes for the 2 wt % CNF (CNF1.32 and CNF2.01) gels. This strain
sweep test allows us to probe the transition from linear to nonlinear
viscoelastic behavior. At 0 mM NaCl, the G′
and G″ of the gels are approximately constant
at low strains, and then, both moduli decrease rapidly with G′ dropping below G″ at high
strains (Figure 6a),
implying that the gels have been yielded to flowing liquids. Specifically,
at sufficiently high stress amplitude, the gels exhibit a single and
relatively smooth yielding transition from a linear viscoelastic regime.
The decrease in moduli with increasing strain is likely due to the
progressive breakdown of the entangled fibril network. The curves
of strain sweeps for the CNF1.32 and CNF2.01 gels have a similar slope
but are shifted to a lower elasticity and linear viscoelastic range
with the increase of DS. Figure 6b shows viscoelastic behavior of the gels at 10 mM
NaCl. The yielding transition is remarkably different from that at
0 mM NaCl, where broader nonlinear regimes and two shoulders in G″ could be clearly seen. The local maximum in G″ is related to some dissipation processes induced
by internal rearrangements of the network structure under shear flow.
The similar so-called two-step yielding behavior is also observed
in a number of disordered systems such as colloidal gels and glasses,
where the energy dissipation is generally identified by bond and cage
breaking, respectively.28−32 The increase in both G′ and G″ with increasing NaCl concentration also indicates that screening
of electrostatic repulsion between the fibrils can contribute to the
formation of more dense gels. Further increasing NaCl concentration
to 100 mM appears to have a negligible effect on the rheological properties,
as evidenced by the similar moduli for the gels (Figure 6c).

Figure 6 Storage modulus G′ (solid symbols) and
loss modulus G″ (open symbols) as a function
of strain amplitude for 2 wt % hydrogels of CNF1.32 and CNF2.01 at
NaCl concentrations of (a) 0, (b) 10, and (c) 100 mM.

The G′ and G″ measured
during the frequency sweep experiments in the linear domain are plotted
in Figure 7. Consistent
with the expected solidlike properties of the gels, we find that G′ dominates over G″ in the
measured frequency range. It is important to note that G′ and G″ are almost independent of
frequency, and no crossover is observed for them. The CNF1.32 and
CNF2.01 gels exhibit qualitatively similar relaxation spectra.

Figure 7 Storage modulus G′ (solid symbols) and
loss modulus G″ (open symbols) as a function
of frequency for 2 wt % hydrogels of (a) CNF1.32 and (b) CNF2.01 at
different NaCl concentrations (0, 10, and 100 mM).

We now turn to the dependence of the gel strength
on the CNF concentration
(c) investigated. The gel strength can be characterized
by the elastic modulus plateau (G0′), measured during the
strain sweep experiments in the linear domain, and a power-law scaling
of G0′ with c is assessed to determine the
changes in the gels formed as G0′ ≈ cn. Figure 8 shows the concentration dependence of G0′ for
the CNF1.32 and CNF2.01 gels, respectively, at different NaCl concentrations.

Figure 8 G0′ as a function of CNF concentration (c) for 2 wt
% hydrogels of (a) CNF1.32 and (b) CNF2.01 at different
NaCl concentrations (0, 10, and 100 mM). Solid line is obtained using
a power-law scaling of G0′ with c.

We find that at 0 mM NaCl the
scaling exponent is 6.311 and 7.438
for the CNF1.32 and CNF2.01 gels, respectively. The values are considerably
larger than those proposed by models for semiflexible biopolymers,33,34 which yield scaling exponents of 2–2.5. More recently, a
new scaling theory with the power-law exponent of 11/3 to 7 was proposed
for the CNF suspensions with increasing cellulose volume fraction,
where the elastic energy of cellulose fibers is attributed to bending.35 One possible explanation for the discrepancies
is that the different ability to form physically entangled structures
and the different type of fibril entanglements may dictate the measured
strength. The CNF2.01 gel is composed of more flexible fibrils that
can entangle more readily than the stiffer fibrils present in the
CNF1.32 gel, resulting in a higher entanglement density. However,
at 10 and 100 mM NaCl, the scaling exponent is changed to 1.981 and
3.135 for the CNF1.32 and CNF2.01 gels, respectively. The different
exponent shows further evidence for distinct gelation routes of the
CNF gels with and without salt addition. In the presence of NaCl,
the large clusters observed can act as a single building block contributing
to the elasticity of the gels. The slow relaxation of coupled clusters
contributes to the gel strength in different ways and leads probably
to a lower exponent. Remarkably, the same scaling behavior is observed
for the CNF gels, regardless the NaCl concentration.

We are
thus motivated to identify the link between the local structure
and dynamical arrest with increasing DS and NaCl concentration. Gelation
requires the formation of a solidified space-spanning network, which
can be interpreted as a consequence of the interplay between long-range
repulsion and short-range attraction. Here, the interplay gives rise
to the formation of finite-sized aggregates with defined morphology
spanning the gap between nano- and microscale (Figures 2 and 4). The gels
can be formed through cross-link percolation if the fractal clusters
become sufficiently large to result in a percolated network. The salt
addition is proposed to initiate gelation by screening of the repulsive
charges on the fibrils and to dominate gel properties through entanglement
and cross-linking.36 The increase in gel
strength with increasing NaCl concentration is caused by the reduction
in the Debye length and stronger screening of electrostatic repulsion
between the fibrils, thereby making van der Waals interactions dominant
forces to facilitate the promotion of interfibril association as well
as the onset of gelation. Moreover, the salt addition can trigger
an abrupt density fluctuation in the suspensions accompanied by the
formation of locally dense clusters and voids by spinodal decomposition.
The formation of the stable clusters as building blocks seems a precursor
to the gelation. Moreover, it has been suggested that the LAOS behavior,
which reflects both the intensity of mechanical constrains and the
deformation length scale, can be effectively used as a tool for classifying
the colloid gels and glasses.28−32 On the basis of the relaxation of density fluctuations as probed
by rheology, it seems that two characteristic length scales directly
emerge from this scenario: the first yield point is due to the breaking
of bonds between interconnected clusters, while the second one is
attributed to the breaking of clusters into smaller constituents.
We hypothesize that in this situation the fibrils localized in clusters
are load-bearing because of excluded volume effects, and the dense
clusters confined to a finite volume are developed into an attractive
glass, which can be formulated in terms of a cage where each cluster
is trapped within the potential landscape set up by the neighboring
clusters.37,38 Thus, the origin of the dynamical arrest
can be qualitatively diverged into simultaneous development of a fractal
structure of cross-linked fibrils from percolation and of a larger
scale structure of domains resulting from spinodal decomposition (Figure 9). It should be noted
that the continuity between the gelation and glass transition is recognized
in the same experimental systems. This result is consistent with a
very recent theoretical speculation that attractive particles may
undergo a fluid to solid transition because of jamming.39 It demonstrated that a phase diagram can be
used to unify the description of a wide variety of transitions from
fluidlike to solidlike behavior by means of the so-called jamming
transition.

Figure 9 Schematic illustration of the link between the local structure
and dynamical arrest for CNF gels. The gels can be formed through
cross-link percolation and arrested spinodal decomposition. The coexistence
of gelation and glass transitions are recognized with a global gelation
driven by a local glasslike arrest during spinodal decomposition.

Conclusions
The viscoelastic response
of the CNF hydrogels can be separated
into two contributions including the establishment of cross-linked
clusters on a fibril level and the arrested spinodal decomposition
on a cluster level. The arrested spinodal decomposition produces the
gels composed of glassy clusters not commonly observed in soft matter
systems. This implies that the gelation and glass transitions are
dynamically coupled on different length scales, with dense attractive
glasses as building blocks for the gel formation. Because gels and
glasses are observed in the same experimental systems, they have been
linked within unified pictures of jamming transition. The model system
provides a potential framework to understand and generalize the gelation
and glass transition to elucidate the nature of the yielding of hydrogels.

Experimental
Section
Preparation of Acetylated CNFs and Their Hydrogels
Cotton microcrystalline cellulose (Aldrich Chemistry, Shanghai, China)
was dispersed into a mixture of acetic acid (1:10, w/v) and sulfuric
acid (5%, w/w cellulose), and then a desired amount of acetic anhydride
was added to obtain different acetylated samples. The reaction mixture
was stirred vigorously at 50 °C for 1 h. After acetylation, 10-fold
deionized water was added, and the resulting sample was centrifuged
at 4000 rpm for 10 min to remove excess acid. Then, the sample was
collected and passed 10 times through a high-pressure homogenizer
(AH-2010, ATS Engineering Inc., Germany) under value pressure of 1000
bar to obtain acetylated CNF samples. For further purification, the
acetylated CNF was dialyzed with membranes against deionized water
for several days until the pH of the water from successive washes
stayed constant. The acetylation was confirmed by Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy with the characteristic vibrations of the grafted
acetyl groups easily identified (Supporting Information, Figure S1). The DS defined as the average number of acetyl groups
substituted on a glucose unit with a maximum possible value of 3,
which can be determined by a titration method.26 According to their degrees of substitution, three CNF samples
are obtained as CNF0, CNF1.32, and CNF2.01, respectively.

The
CNF suspension was concentrated by immersing the dialysis tube in
polyethylene glycol 20 000 and then diluted with deionized
water in the concentration range of 0.5–2.6 wt %. For studies
on the influence of salt addition, NaCl was added to the sample with
different concentrations of 0, 10, and 100 mM.

Characterization of Acetylated
CNFs and Their Hydrogels
The morphology of the CNF samples
was analyzed using a Philips Tecnai
12 transmission electron microscope at 120 kV acceleration voltage.
Drops of the diluted CNF samples were deposited on a TEM grid and
dried under ambient conditions. To improve the contrast, the acety-CNF
suspension was negatively stained with phosphomolybdic acid. ImageJ
software was used to measure the physical dimensions of the CNFs.

The microstructure of the CNF samples was characterized by the NanoSTAR
small angle X-ray scattering (Bruker-AXS, Germany). The samples were
sealed in quartz capillaries, and a two-dimension charge-coupled detector
(Vantec-2000, USA) was used to record the scattering intensity I. The distance of the sample detector was set to 1070 mm,
and the X-ray wavelength λ = 1.54 Å, giving an accessible
scattering vector q-range of 0.007–0.23 Å–1. Scattering data recorded from a cell filled with
water were subtracted as background.

The microstructure observation
of the CNF samples was carried out
with a CLSM system (Zeiss LSM 710, Carl Zeiss Inc., Braunschweig,
Germany). For fluorescent staining, a drop of 1% calcofluor-white
dissolved in acetone was added to 1 mL of the samples.

The rheology
measurements were performed on a stress-controlled
rotational rheometer (DHR-3, TA Instruments) using a plate–plate
geometry (plate diameter of 40 mm and gap of 1 mm). Steady-shear experiments
and large-amplitude oscillatory experiments were carried out at a
constant temperature of 25 °C only for samples with gel-like
properties. A steady-shear rate flow curve was obtained covering the
range from 0.1 to 100 s–1. An oscillatory strain
amplitude sweep was done in the strain range from 0.01 to 5000% at
a fixed frequency of 1 Hz, and a frequency sweep was done over a range
from 0.1 to 10 Hz at 0.2% strain (within the linear viscoelastic domain,
as determined from the strain amplitude sweep). As a result, the mechanical
spectra for storage modulus (G′) and loss
modulus (G″) have been recorded to determine
the viscoelastic properties of the gels.
