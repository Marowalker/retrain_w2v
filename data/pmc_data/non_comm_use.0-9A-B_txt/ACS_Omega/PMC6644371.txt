This study presents a development
in quantitative structure–property
relationships (QSPRs) for research in organic semiconductor materials
by introducing a new structural descriptor called “degree of
π-orbital overlap” based on two-dimensional structure
information of aromatic molecules. Application of this method to predict
the electronic properties of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)
molecules, which are known to be the core component of many organic
semiconductor materials, is presented. Results demonstrated that QSPRs
based on the new descriptor can predict rather accurate band gaps,
ionization potentials and electron affinities for a large number of
PAHs compared to those explicitly calculated by density functional
theory method. This research opens new possibilities for developing
QSPRs for other organic semiconductor classes in future.

1 Introduction
Organic
semiconductor materials have opened a new era for developments
of new organic-based electronic technologies and are predicted to
be an alternative to amorphous silicon-based materials.1−5 There are four main groups of organic semiconductor materials: organic
light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic field effect transistors, organic
thin-film transistors, and organic photovoltaics, each of which has
different physical properties.

Organic semiconductor materials
for fabricating electronic devices
must be stable toward oxidation agents (e.g., oxygen) and have sufficiently
high charge mobility as well as good photoelectronic properties.5,6 To screen for materials satisfying such requirements, molecular
properties, namely, lowest excitation energy, ionization potential
(IP), and electron affinity (EA) are often used. These properties
can be normally predicted from accurate first-principles quantum chemistry
calculations, such as density functional theory (DFT). However, it
is expensive in both time and computational resources. A number of
more cost-effective methodologies based on quantum chemistry framework
have been developed for predicting the electronic properties of organic
semiconductor materials. For example, a previous study7 suggested that semiempirical molecular orbital (MO) could
be used to predict trends in band gaps for molecules within a given
class since these properties differed from those calculated by more
accurate density functional theory (DFT) by only shifting constants.
Another approach is to couple a “solvation” model with
DFT to include condensed-phase effects in predicting the electronic
properties of organic solids.8 A more common
computational approach is the use of quantum mechanical (QM) and molecular
mechanical models for studying the characters of disordered organic
semiconductors.9 Regarding applications,
a high-throughput study to quantify the differences in band gaps of
isolated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules and its crystals
was reported.10 Also, static polarizability
and ionization potential were used as primary descriptors correlating
with highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)–lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO) gaps of halogenobenzenes.11

Nevertheless, all of these methods are QM-based and
do require
time and efforts to compute properties of each compound and thus are
not desirable at the initial designing stage where experimentalists
only need reasonable estimates for a large number of possible candidates
to arrive at a short list from which they can be further ranked by
more accurate quantum chemistry calculations prior to carrying out
actual experiments. Unfortunately, there is no possibility to do so.

Data analytics methodology, such as “quantitative structure–property
relationship” (QSPR),12 has been
widely applied in drug design for screening biological activity, physicochemical
properties, and toxicological responses. QSPR provides empirical relationships
between chemical structural properties and the physical, chemical,
or biological ones, which may require extensive calculations or experiments.
There are some QSPRs currently available for predicting properties
of organic semiconductor materials, such as for glass-transition temperature
of OLED materials,13 for charge-transfer
rates of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs),14 or for predicting the toxicity of PAHs.15 It is well known that PAH is the core component of many
organic semiconductor materials in actual applications. For instance,
PAH is the main component for synthesizing thienoacenes and tetraarylethenes
in fabricating OLED materials.3,16−18

To the best of our knowledge, there have not been any QSPRs
available
for predicting important electronic properties, namely, band gaps,
ionization potentials, and electron affinities, for a general PAH
class of molecules. The objective of this study is to develop QSPRs
for predicting the electronic properties of PAH class of molecules.
Such QSPRs would greatly assist in the design of new PAH-based organic
semiconductor materials.

2 Computational Details
2.1 QSPR Method
The QSPR method provides
a framework for developing mathematical correlations between the chemical
structural features and its corresponding properties. The essential
aspect of the QSPR technique is the exploration of property features
encoded within its structural descriptors. The basis formalism is
response = f(descriptors-chemical structure, physicochemical
property). Empirical mathematical relationships can be derived from
a given set of data (training set), and then the relations can be
used to predict/estimate properties of any similar molecules not in
the training set. The main challenge of this method is to arrive at
a set of descriptors for a given set of properties. A good QSPR is
the one with the least number of descriptors while having a wide range
of applicability, namely, a large molecular space. For that reason,
descriptors for construction of reliable QSPR model should have the
following features:12

a. be relevant to a
broad class of compounds,

b. be fast in its calculation and independent
of experimental/calculated properties, and

c. have different values for structurally
dissimilar molecules, even if the structural differences are small.

Hence, constructing a good descriptor is the
key to the success
of the QSPR approach.

Various categories have been used to describe
a QSPR descriptor,
namely, constitutional: the relative numbers of various atom types;
topological: describing bond connectivity of atoms in the molecule;
physicochemical: relating to its physical or chemical properties,
such as solubility in a given solvent (typically water or lipid),
dipole moment, and formal charge; structural: describing the three-dimensional
(3D) size, shape, and surface properties of the molecule; quantum
chemical: relating to properties from quantum calculations, such as
partial charges, polarizabilities, multipole moment, etc.19 The choice of certain descriptors following
the criteria suggested above is important for developing good QSPRs.

Previously, a number of indices were introduced to provide a quantitative
understanding of aromaticity, such as harmonic oscillator model of
aromaticity (HOMA), nuclear-independent chemical shift (NICS), para-delocalization
index (PDI), aromatic fluctuation index (FLU), and multicenter index
(MCI).20 Although some interesting correlations
between these indices and properties of PAH molecules were found,
the use of these indices for QSPRs is limited. For example, HOMA presented
excellent linear correlations with bond energy, but it is for a single
ring not for a general PAH class while NICS index for a group of linear
and angular PAH.21 Furthermore, these indices
are QM-based descriptors. For the purpose of this study, a structural
or topological descriptor should be used.

2.2 BG(1) Descriptor
To understand aromaticity
in aromatic molecules, Clar and co-workers
suggested a method to quantify resonance structures known as aromatic
sextet patterns. According to Clar’s theory, PAH isomer with
more sextet patterns is more stable. Although the original theory
only provides a qualitative understanding of aromaticity, it motivated
a number of application studies on different classes of aromatic compounds
as well as further theory developments.22−34 One of such studies is the development of aromatic sextet polynomials
by Hosoya et al.27 that quantifies aromaticity
of PAH structures.22−24,26−28,31,33,34 In fact, Hosoya and Yamaguchi35 introduced the “sextet polynomial”
to quantify the level of resonance in an aromatic molecule by classifying
different resonance structures in terms of the resonance sextet number r(G, k), which is the
number of Kekule structures from the G molecule that
have k sextets (isolated benzene rings with three
double bonds). By definition, r(G, 0) is unity for all cases. Also, r(G, 1) is equal to the number of hexagons in the molecule.

For
instance, dibenz(a,c)anthracene
has five Kekule structures having two sextets (at hexagons (1, 4),
(1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (4, 5) in Figure 1), i.e., r(G, 2) = 5, and two structures having three sextet patterns, r(G, 3) = 2.

Figure 1 Dibenz(a,c)anthracene.

The sextet polynomial BG(x) is then defined as  where m is the largest
number
of sextets in the molecule.

Dibenz(a,c)anthracene’s
sextet polynomial is 1 + 5x + 5x2 + 2x3. When x = 1, BG(1) is the sum of the coefficients
of the polynomial, which is the same as the number of Kekule structures
of the aromatic hydrocarbon.

In accordance with Clar, the Kekule
structure with the maximum
number of sextet pattern represents the electronic ground state of
a PAH, and the more sextets a PAH has, the more stable it is. This
suggests that there may be a correlation between the BG(1) and the relative stability of PAHs. Nonetheless,
there has not been any study on the relationships between BG(1) and the physical or chemical properties
of PAH molecules. Exploring the possibility of using BG(1) as a topological descriptor is an objective of this
QSPR study.

2.3 Degree of π-Orbital
Overlap Descriptor
Although BG(1) is based on well-tested
Clar’s theory, evaluation of its value is not simple and thus
its use for QSPR development and application would be limited. In
this study, we propose a new structural descriptor called degree of
π-orbital overlap (DPO). It is based on a known fact that aromaticity
of PAH molecule relates to the delocalization of π-orbitals
on the planar structural framework. Such delocalization affects molecular
orbital energies and hence ionization potential, electron affinity,
and band gap properties. Furthermore, previous studies have shown
that π-orbital delocalization in PAH is affected by its structural
shape.5,36

There are four basic building blocks
or four different ways for adding a benzene ring to an existing PAH
for constructing a larger one (see Figure 2). These blocks suggest four separate parameters,
namely, a–d to describe DPO
for a given molecule.

Figure 2 Building blocks for constructing a given PAH molecule;
(a–d)
are simplified models showing how these building blocks are related
to the DPO a–d parameters.

Simplified cartoons shown in Figure 2 suggest that one
can think of π-electrons in
PAH molecules as particle-in-a two-dimensional (2D) box with a more
complex shape. DPO value, in this case, would be an effective length
of a simplified 2D box.

2.3.1 Rule for Determining
the DPO Value of a
PAH Structure
Step 1. The first step is to determine the
reference segment by applying the following rules in sequential order
till a distinct reference segment is found.

Rules for reference
segment.

a. The segment with the largest number
of fused rings in the molecule is the reference segment.

b. If all segments have the same size,
then the segment with the largest number of parallel fused C–C
bonds orthogonal to its direction is the reference segment.

c. If rules (a) and (b) do
not yield a
unique segment, then the segment with the least number of overlayers
is the reference segment.

For example, for
the PAH molecule shown in Figure 3, segment 1 has the largest number of fused
rings (rule (a)) and thus is selected to be the reference segment
with the line of reference as shown.

Figure 3 Segment 1 is the reference segment.

In Figure 4, the
top-row molecule has three segments with the same size and thus rule
(a) cannot be applied. Using rule (b), structure I shows that the
reference segment is preferred over structure II by having a larger
number of parallel fused bonds orthogonal to the reference direction.
In the bottom-row molecule in Figure 4, both rules (a) and (b) do not yield a unique segment.
In this case, rule (c) helps to select the reference segment, as shown
in structure III instead of structure IV.

Figure 4 Segments with arrows
in I and III are chosen to be the reference
segments.

Step 2. Assigning DPO value for
each fused bond.

After selecting the reference segment, DPO
values are assigned
to each fused bond and depend on four structure-dependent parameters
as described below.

Beginning with the reference segment, starting
from the left most,
each fused bond has a value successively of 1, 1 – a, 1 – 2a, 1 – 3a,... where a is a parameter. DPO values for fused
bonds on overlayer segments that are paralleled to the reference one,
as shown in Figure 5, are scaled by factors of dk, where k is the order of its layer above or below the reference,
i.e., the segment lays kth row above/below the reference
and d is also a parameter.

Figure 5 Illustration of assigning
DPO topological parameters a–d to fused bonds.

For a segment that forms
a 120° angle with the reference one
(or its fused bonds form a 60° angle with those of reference
segment), the DPO value starts at the value b and
is scaled by a factor of d for each subsequent fused
bond, as shown in Figures 5 and 6. Similarly, a segment forms
a 60° angle with the reference segment (its fused bonds from
a 120° angle with those of the reference segment) and DPO values
start at the value c and are also scaled by a factor d for each subsequent fused bond. b and c are parameters. Examples of assigning DPO for these types
of fused bonds are shown below.

Figure 6 Examples of assigning DPO values for type
2 fused bonds.

The total DPO value for
the molecule is the sum of all DPO values
assigned for all fused bonds.

2.3.2 Determination
of DPO Parameters
Since a–d parameters describe
different topological aspects of PAH structures, their values can
be determined by a relatively small number of PAH molecules with specific
structural features. These molecules along with their properties are
listed in Table S1 in the Supporting Information.
For instance, the parameter a can be determined by
minimizing the root-mean-square difference (RMSD) errors in its correlation
with band gaps (HOMO–LUMO gap) for linear acenes from three
to eight fused rings, as shown in Figure 7a. Once the parameter a is
determined, it can be used to determine parameters b and c using the structures in Figure 7b,c, in the same manner, respectively.
Finally, with a, b, and c already known, d is determined using
the same procedure with structures in Figure 7d.

Figure 7 Molecules used to determine DPO structural parameters.
(a)–(d)
are subgroups of PAH molecules that were used to determine the DPO
parameters a, b, c, and d, respectively.

The optimal values of these structural parameters are a = 0.05, b = −1/4, c = +1/3,
and d = 1/3.

We note that the DPO value is
unitless as BG(1).

2.3.3 Illustrations
Examples for assigning
DPO value for each fused bond and their total values are given below
for two different PAH molecules. The total DPO values of compounds
A and B are 2.28 and 2.48, respectively (Figure 8).

Figure 8 (A, B) Two examples of how to assign DPO parameters
to fused bonds.

2.4 Data
Sets
In this study, two separate
data sets were used, namely, the QSPR parameter development set consisting
of all PAH molecules having four to six fused benzene rings, and the
test set consisting of all PAH ones having seven and eight fused benzene
rings. Structures and properties of the development set are given
in Table S2a,b in the Supporting Information.
The QSPR parameter development set is used to develop the linear QSPR
parameters to correlate each electronic property with the selected
descriptor. The test set is used to assess the accuracy of the developed
QSPR in predicting corresponding properties.

2.5 Computational
Methods
For each molecule
in both data sets, its 3D structure is fully optimized at the PM7
semiempirical MO theory using the MOPAC201637 package and at the B3LYP/6-31+G(d) DFT method using the Gaussian
09 program. B3LYP/6-31+G(d) method is known to predict rather accurately
in calculating frontier orbital energies.38−40

The PM7
method was used to verify our previous finding on the relative differences
in its calculated HOMO–LUMO gap with those DFT calculations
for molecules in the same class. The HOMO–LUMO gap is used
to estimate the band gap.11 According to
Koopman’s theory, the ionization potential is estimated by
the negative value of the HOMO orbital energy, and similarly, the
electron affinity is estimated by the negative value of the LUMO one.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Assessment
of BG(1) Descriptor
Figure 9A–C shows
good linear correlations (all of the
correlation coefficients R2 are from 0.85
to 0.99) of BG(1) values with band gaps
(A); with ionization potentials (B); and with electron affinities
(C) of isomers with the same number of fused rings. In Figure 9, it is clearly observed that
the structure having larger BG(1) value
is more stable by having a larger band gap. This is consistent with
the suggestion by Clar and Ruiz-Morales, a PAH molecule having the
higher “maximum number of resonant sextets”27 is more stable compared to its isomers with
fewer aromatic sextets.23,27,36 This result verifies for the first time the conclusion of Clar and
Ruiz-Morales23,36 about the possibility of existing
correlations between the aromatic sextet numbers and the electronic
properties of PAHs.

Figure 9 Linear correlations of BG(1)
with HOMO–LUMO
gaps (A); with ionization potentials (B), and with electron affinities
(C) calculated using the DFT method; blue diamond dots indicate four
fused rings, red squares indicate five fused rings, and green triangles
indicate six fused rings.

However, these correlations are limited to only isomers having
the same number of fused rings. For a larger molecular PAH space with
a different number of fused rings, there is no correlation found.
In addition, BG(1) values are difficult
to calculate for complicated structures having more than seven fused
rings using Hosoya’s27 rule. Consequently, BG(1) descriptor is not appropriate for developing
QSPR.

3.2 Assessment of DPO Descriptor
Linear
correlations between DPO values and the three electronic properties
are shown in Figure 10A–C.

Figure 10 Linear correlations between DPO and HOMO–LUMO gaps
(A),
ionization potentials (B), and electron affinities (C) of PAHs from
four to six fused rings calculated using the DFT method.

This figure shows excellent linear correlations
between DPOs and
the electronic properties of PAHs with correlation coefficients (R2) all greater than 0.9. In addition, these
linear relationships can cover a wide range of PAH molecules having
different numbers of fused rings. Equations for these correlations
of band gaps, IP, and EA properties with DPO are given in Table 1. Comparing to those
in Figure 9, these
results suggest that DPO is much better than BG(1) for using as a topological descriptor in developing QSPR.
Moreover, calculating DPO value for any PAH is rather straightforward
as described above.

3.3 Scaling to DFT Accuracy
Semiempirical
MO method, such as PM7, is much more cost-effective when calculating
the electronic properties for a large number of molecules, compared
to DFT methodology. Thus, it is more convenient to use PM7 to explore
different QSPRs and to develop new descriptors with a condition that
PM7 calculating properties can be scaled to those of DFT values. Our
previous study found that PM6 band gap data could be shifted by a
constant to match values calculated using the DFT method.7 Here, we test if the same observation is applied
for the PM7 method.

For each property, shifted PM7 values are
calculated by adding the shifting constant c, which
is defined as the average absolute difference between the PM7 and
DFT values.

QSPRs for electronic properties from PM7, shifted
PM7, and DFT
methods are plotted in Figure 11, and their corresponding equations are listed in Table 1. The present results
further confirmed our earlier finding that semiempirical MO method
can correctly predict trends in the electronic properties, namely,
band gap, IP, and EA, as its linear equations differ from those of
DFT data mostly by shifted constants. Root-mean-square difference
(RMSD) values between DFT values and shifted PM7 ones for band gap,
ionization potential, and electron affinity, respectively, are 0.123,
0.052, and 0.076 eV. In addition, available experimental values41,42 (triangles in Figure 11) for the band gaps of some PAH structures are also plotted.
The results illustrate that both shifted PM7 and DFT QSPRs are within
the experimental uncertainty. This suggests that one can use the PM7
method to develop QSPRs or for screening for trends in the electronic
properties of materials. Corrections can be made by calculating the
shifting constants using a small number of molecules in the training
set.

gaps, (B) ionization potentials, and (C) electron affinities. The
red dots indicate DFT calculations; the blue squares indicate PM7
calculations; the triangles indicate experimental data; the solid
lines indicate DFT calculations; the dot lines indicate shifted PM7;
and the dash lines indicate PM7 calculations.

All of the equations are shown in Table 1.

3.4 Assessment of DPO-Based
QSPRs
To
assess the accuracy and predictability of the DPO-based QSPRs for
the electronic properties of PAH molecules, properties of all molecules
in the test set were also calculated at the same DFT level theory
and plotted against those predicted by QSPRs, as shown in Figures 12–14.

Figure 12 Plots of QSPR vs DFT
for HOMO–LUMO gaps of all molecules
in the test set (A) for shifted PM7 QSPR equation and (B) for DFT
QSPR equation.

Figure 13 Plots of QSPR vs DFT
for ionization potentials of all molecules
in the test set (A) for shifted PM7 QSPR equation and (B) for DFT
QSPR equation.

Figure 14 Plots of QSPR vs DFT
for electron affinities of all molecules in
the test set (A) for shifted PM7 QSPR equation and (B) for DFT QSPR
equation.

According to the results from Figures 12–14, QSPRs
from shifted PM7 and DFT predict equally well the band gap and ionization
potential. Statistically, those from shifted PM7 QSPR perform slightly
better. The R2 values of correlations
range from 0.96 to 0.98, which demonstrates that the DPO is an excellent
descriptor for developing QSPRs for the electronic properties of aromatic
systems.19

3.5 How To
Use DPO-Based QSPRs
For a
given PAH molecule, the first step is to determine its DPO value from
the rule described above: (a) choose the reference segment; (b) assign
each fused C–C bond its value; and (c) sum all of these values
to give DPO.

For band gap, use the QSPR y =
−0.65x + 4.68 (where DPO is x); similarly, y = −0.30x + 6.04 for ionization potential equation, and y = 0.35x + 1.36 for electron affinity.

We
note that higher DPO value predicts lower band gap for the PAH
structure, which also means that the molecule is less aromatic.11

3.6 Issues with Planarity
We recall that
the degree of π-orbital overlap descriptor presented in this
study is based on the 2D topological information of the molecules.
For PAHs, 2D structures/drawings are planar. Previous studies have
reported a variety of structural characters that can affect the electronic
properties of PAH, such as the maximum number of aromatic sextets
and the holes in each Kekule resonance structure,22−24,26−28,32−34,43 the zigzag or linear
shape of the molecule structure,36,44 as well as
its structural planarity.36,45 DPO can capture most
except the planarity structural character. For that reason, one can
expect nonplanar PAH molecules to be exceptions to the present DPO-based
QSPRs. Below we provide several examples to illustrate this case.

According to DPO-based QSPRs, the band gaps of molecules shown in Table 2 would decrease from
left to right (1–3) from 2.65 to 2.36 eV due to more parallel
fused bonds added to molecules, as suggested by the rule. Explicit
DFT calculations for HOMO–LUMO, however, predict no significant
difference between them. This is due to the fact that molecules 1–3
are nonplanar. Such nonplanarity, as shown in Figure 15, is caused by steric effects between the
two segments. Due to such nonplanarity, the delocalization of electrons
in π orbitals from one segment to the other is disrupted and
thus band gaps of these molecules appear to depend only on the band
gap of the longest segment. In principle, the degree of nonplanarity
can be added as an additional correction descriptor to QSPRs although
it would increase the complexity of the method and can be considered
in a future study.

4 Conclusions
This
study presents the development of new quantitative structure–property
relationships to enable predictions of electronic properties, namely,
band gaps, ionization potential, and electron affinities of PAH molecules
without having to perform expensive explicit quantum chemistry calculations.
We found that the structural property based on the well-known Clar’s
theory of aromaticity provides good linear correlation with the electronic
properties of PAH molecules, yet limited to only isomers having the
same number of fused benzene rings.

A new descriptor called
“degree of π-orbital overlap”
based on 2D topological information of PAH molecules is developed.
Results show that DPO-based QSPRs can accurately predict band gap,
ionization potential, and electron affinity compared to those from
explicit DFT calculations for a large class of PAH molecules. Comparing
to previously reported aromatic indices, such as HOMA, PDI, FLU, MCI,
and NICS, DPO establishes a much simpler and yet more general framework
for correlating the electronic properties of PAH molecules with its
2D topological information. Consequently, it will open new possibilities
for using DPO for further developments of QSPRs for organic semiconductor
materials.
