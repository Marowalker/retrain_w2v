The osmotic heat
engine represents a new and promising technology
for the harvesting of low-grade waste heat from various sources. However,
the lack of an adequate semipermeable membrane hinders the technology’s
advancement. In this study, we investigated the application of a freestanding
graphene oxide membrane (GOM) for energy generation in an osmotic
heat engine. The synthesized GOM has a water permeability coefficient
of 4.4 L m–2 h–1 bar–1 (LMH-bar). The internal concentration polarization in the osmosis
filtration system can be minimized because no membrane support layer
is needed for the freestanding GOM. As a result, high water flux and
high power density are obtained. For example, under an applied hydraulic
pressure of 6.90 bar, with a 2 M draw solution of ammonium bicarbonate
solution, a power density of 20.0 W/m2 is achieved. This
study shows that the freestanding GOM is promising for application
in the osmotic heat engine. Future research regarding improving the
mechanical properties and water stability of the GOM is beneficial
for further advancing the technology.

Introduction
Current excessive reliance
on nonrenewable, carbon-emitting fossil
fuels to generate energy creates severe problems such as climate change
and environmental pollution.1,2 Developing sustainable
energy technologies and enhancing the energy utilization efficiency
of existing industrial processes are two effective methods to reduce
the negative impact of fossil fuels.3−5 More than 30% of the
U.S. energy supply is consumed by industrial processes and 20–50%
of that energy is lost in the form of waste heat.5,6 Utilizing
this waste heat can increase the energy efficiency of those industrial
processes and also prevent thermal pollution,7 thereby transforming an environmentally harmful process to an environmentally
benign one. In addition, a significant amount of untapped heat energy
is also available from geothermal and solar-based processes.8

The most efficient way of using untapped
waste heat is directly
utilizing it for heat pumps and space heating. However, direct onsite
usage is largely confined to the locality of the waste heat sources.9 Hence, when matching needs for direct utilization
are absent near the heat sources, converting the waste heat into electricity
becomes the only option available. Unfortunately, less than 10% of
the waste heat from industrial processes has the high quality needed
for electricity generation via existing technologies.10 Current commercial technologies such as the organic Rankine
cycle can operate with a relatively high-grade waste heat source (temperature
of 90–300 °C).6 However, a
large amount of waste heat with a temperature of 45–60 °C
is produced during industrial processes and is unrecoverable via existing
technologies.11,12 Besides, a large amount of thermal
energy exists in the Earth’s crust. To convert geothermal energy
into electricity, access to a high-temperature heat source by drilling
is necessary because the more easily accessible low-grade heat cannot
be utilized to generate electricity with existing methods.9,13 The development of new technologies that can efficiently convert
low-grade heat into electricity is, thus, beneficial toward utilizing
waste heat as a sustainable energy source.

The membrane-based
heat engine is a promising technology that can
convert low-grade heat into electricity.14,15 This technology consists of a closed-loop power system made up of
two components: electricity generation and thermal separation (Figure 1). The electricity
generation component converts the energy released from the controlled
mixing of two solutions with different salinity gradients (salt concentrations)
into electricity.14 The principle of pressure-retarded
osmosis (PRO) is utilized in the heat engine to produce pressurized
water flow. With the help of a semipermeable membrane, water molecules
can transport from the low salt concentrated solution (feed solution)
to the high salt concentrated solution (draw solution). The kinetic
energy from the pressurized draw solution is then converted to electricity
by using a mechanical turbine.16 Because
osmotic pressure acts as the driving force in the electricity generation
component, the technology is best represented by the osmotic heat
engine. The osmotic heat engine is the most widely studied membrane-based
technology for low-grade heat harvesting; however, other membrane-based
systems have also been proposed and evaluated.17 Alternatively, by regulating the ion transport of different
charges, an osmotic ion flux can be generated inside the system. The
ion flux can then be converted to an electron flow by using electrodes,
whereby electricity can be generated.18,19 Unlike the
osmotic heat engine, the ion flux generating technology uses permselective ion-exchange
membranes20,21 to produce an osmotic ionic current known
as reverse electrodialysis to power the heat engine.22,23

Figure 1 Schematic
illustration of a membrane-based osmotic heat engine
for low-grade waste heat harvesting.

The thermal separation component of the osmotic heat engine
regenerates
the draw solution and feed solution by using waste heat as an energy
source.14 Different working electrolyte
solutions have been evaluated to maximize energy production.24 Generally, the salts that form the electrolyte
solutions should pose high solubility in water (or other solvents),
which provides a large driving force, and should be easy to regenerate.14,23 Inorganic ionic salts, such as sodium chloride, were investigated
in previous studies.25,26 In those cases, the waste heat
was used to reconcentrate the draw solutions by vaporizing part of
the water. However, the energy-intensive vaporization process leads
to a low thermal efficiency.14 Alternatively,
solute extraction was applied to regenerate the draw and feed solutions.23 The salt ions transferred from the draw solution
into the feed solution can be extracted during the thermal separation
step. Comparing to conventional ionic salts, the thermolytic salts
(ammonium bicarbonate) were found to have a higher conversion efficiency
when utilizing the low-temperature heat sources. The thermolytic salts
in the aqueous phase can be converted to gaseous species (ammonia
and carbon dioxide) upon heating; then, the releasing and resolubilization
of the gas molecules will lead to the regeneration of the feed and
draw solutions, respectively.

Despite the great progress that
has been made in thermodynamic
analysis,9,14,27 technoeconomic
assessment,5 and alternative solute and
solvent investigation,12,24,28 research on the development of membranes for the osmotic heat engine
is scarce. The semipermeable membrane plays an important role in the
osmotic heat engine; the major obstacle to improving the technology
is the lack of an adequate membrane. The transport properties of the
membrane determine water flux and, thus, the power generation of the
entire system. Conventionally, a thin-film composite (TFC) membrane
is applied in the system to generate permeate water flux.14 However, the existence of the membrane porous
support layer results in an internal concentration polarization (ICP),
which decreases the effective driving force across the membrane and
adversely affects the performance of the system (Supporting Information, Figure S1a).29,30

In this study, we investigated the application of a freestanding
graphene oxide membrane (GOM) in the osmotic heat engine. GOM has
been applied in many separation practices because of its excellent
transport properties and sharp molecular cutoff.31−34 By using a freestanding GOM,
we were able to minimize the effect of ICP, increase water flux, and
eventually enhance the energy generation of the osmotic heat engine
system. Although the freestanding GOM has an even higher reverse salt
flux during the osmosis process, because of the elimination of the
membrane porous support layer, salt ions have nowhere to accumulate.
Thus, a large driving force across the GOM can be maintained during
the process (Figure S1b). As a result,
high water flux can be obtained, which is beneficial for power generation
in the osmotic heat engine. The water and ion transport properties
of the GOM have been extensively studied. By combining experimental
work and theoretical modeling, the feasibility of the freestanding
GOM for application in the osmotic heat engine was explored and the
results are discussed herein.

Results and Discussion
Material Characterization
According to the C 1s XPS
spectra (Figure 2a),
both nonoxygenated carbon (C–C, 285.60 eV) and oxygenated carbon
(C–O, 287.72 eV, and C=O, 288.50 eV) can be identified
from the synthesized graphene oxide (GO). The GO sheets were dispersed
on a silicon wafer and then characterized by scanning electron microscopy
(SEM). The SEM image (Figure 2b) indicates that the GO sheet has an average dimension of
around 2 μm. The photograph (Figure S2) of the synthesized freestanding GOM indicates that it is circular
with a uniform thickness. The surface morphology of the freestanding
GOM was characterized by using SEM, and a smooth surface was observed
(Figure 2c), which
is similar to previous studies.35,36 The thickness of the
freestanding GOM was determined from membrane cross-sectional SEM
images and verified by using a micrometer. At least three samples
were measured via SEM, and the average value was reported to represent
the membrane thickness. To ensure that the synthesized GOM has an
adequate water permeability coefficient, we have made the GOM as thin
as possible. The thinnest GOM we were able to synthesize has a thickness
of 1.93 ± 0.07 μm. A GOM with a smaller thickness does
not have enough mechanical stability and tends to break easily. The
GOM cross-sectional SEM image (Figure 2d) reveals a well-packed layered structure throughout
the GOM sample. The layered structure of the GOM was evidenced via
its X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern (Figure S4). The dry and wet GOMs have an interlayer spacing of 0.83 and 1.54
nm, respectively. The GOM was extensively characterized in terms of
transport properties and power generation performance in the osmotic
heat engine.

GO Membrane Water and Ion Transport Properties
Water
permeability coefficient (A) of the freestanding
GOM was determined by using a modified reverse osmosis (RO) testing
cell. Figure 3a lists
the water permeability coefficient of the GOM under the different
hydraulic pressures. The water permeability coefficient is consistent
across all of the measured hydraulic pressure ranges (from 2.07 to
6.90 bar), indicating negligible membrane compaction. A water permeability
coefficient of 4.4 L m–2 h–1 bar–1 (LMH-bar) was determined for the GOM by averaging
values obtained from different hydraulic pressures. The burst pressure
of the GOM was determined to be between 6.90 and 8.97 bar. During
the experiment, when the hydraulic pressure increased from 6.90 to
8.97 bar, a sharp increase in water flowrate occurred across the membrane,37,38 indicating that under the hydraulic pressure of 8.97 bar, the membrane
could not maintain structural integrity. The membrane salt permeability
coefficient (B) was calculated based on the results
from the modified RO tests. With a transmembrane hydraulic pressure
of 3.45 bar, 50 mM NaCl and NH4HCO3 solutions
were used as the feed solutions. For the NaCl solution, a rejection
of 32.64% yields a salt permeability coefficient (B) of 11.13 LMH. For the NH4HCO3 solution, a
slightly higher rejection of 34.58% results in a salt permeability
coefficient of 10.20 LMH. The relatively high salt permeability coefficient
of the GOM might be due to the large interlayer spacing upon hydration
(1.54 nm). The spacing among the GO layers is larger than the hydrated
diameters of the ions so that the ions can pass through the GOM especially
when there is an applied hydraulic pressure.

Figure 3 (a) Water permeability
coefficients of GOM under different hydraulic
pressure differences, (b) water flux and salt flux change with the
change of solution pH in the FO system (1 M NaCl solution and DI water
as draw and feed solutions, respectively), (c) water flux as a function
of draw solution (NaCl) concentration in the FO system by using DI
water or 0.1 M NaCl as a feed solution, and (d) water flux as a function
of draw solution (NH4HCO3) concentration in
the FO system by using DI water or 0.1 M NH4HCO3 as a feed solution. Error bars are ±1 standard deviation.

The GOM was also tested under
a lab-scale forward osmosis (FO)
system to further characterize the transport properties as well as
estimate the PRO power generation preformation. First, 1 M NaCl solution
and deionized (DI) water were chosen as draw and feed solutions, respectively.
To investigate the influence of solution pH on the transport of the
GOM, draw and feed solutions with different pH values were used. Figure 3b shows the water
flux and (reverse) salt flux under various pH values. The water flux
and salt flux remained almost unchanged across the entire investigated
pH range, suggesting that solution pH has negligible influence on
the GOM water and salt transport in the osmosis process. The carboxyl
group, existing at the edge of the GO sheets,39 has been reported to play an important role in ion exchange and
adsorption.40,41 As a weak acid, carboxyl has
a pKa value of about 4.8. When the solution
pH increases, carboxyl groups become deprotonated, which can increase
the charge density of the GOM. As a result, the transport of the charged
species, such as ions, can be potentially influenced. However, the
ion transport of GOM during osmosis was unaffected. A possible explanation
is that the density of the carboxyl group is not high enough, so the
influence of the carboxyl on the ion transport during osmosis is not
apparent.

Then, the membrane water flux was measured by varying
the concentration
of the draw solution. Figure 3c shows the water flux changing with the increase of the NaCl
draw solution concentration. When DI water acts as the feed solution,
the water flux increases almost linearly with the increase of the
draw solution concentration. The change of water flux shares the same
trend with 0.1 M NaCl solution acting as the feed solution. However,
because of the slightly decreased concentration gradient, the effective
driving force and the water flux across the GOM are also reduced.
The linear increase of water flux with the increase of the draw solution
concentration indicates the minimization of the ICP. ICP is a major
limiting factor hindering the performance of the FO and PRO membranes.16 For a conventional TFC membrane, when salt ions
get trapped inside the membrane support layer, the effective driving
force across the membrane can decrease significantly, leading to a
much lower water flux than expected.29 However,
by using the freestanding GOM, the ICP can be reduced because of the
elimination of the membrane support layer. As a result, a larger driving
force can be maintained and a higher water flux can be achieved. Similar
water flux values were obtained when replacing the NaCl solution with
an NH4HCO3 solution, as shown in Figure 3d. The application of the freestanding
GOM results in a significant reduction of the membrane ICP, which
is beneficial for power generation in the PRO and osmotic heat engine
systems.

Projected Power Density and Energy Efficiency in the Osmotic
Heat Engine
The electricity generation component of the osmotic
heat engine determines how much electricity can be generated from
the system. Power density in terms of unit membrane area is calculated
based on the membrane water flux and the draw solution hydraulic pressure.
Because the freestanding GOM does not have a support layer and the
water flux is almost proportional with the draw solution concentration
(Figure 3c,d), the
membrane ICP is neglected during the power density estimation. The
membrane structural parameter (S) is used to quantify
the influence of ICP on water flux and power density;42 thus, the structural parameter is assumed to be zero in
this study.

According to our calculation (using eqs 2 and 3) as
well as previous studies, the power density (W) increases
with the increase of the applied hydraulic pressure on the draw solution
side.14,43 When the hydraulic pressure is approximately
half of the osmotic pressure difference between feed and draw solutions,
peak power density is achieved (Figure S5a). Figure 4a lists
the calculated peak power density values from the different NH4HCO3 draw solutions (DI water as the feed solution).
As draw solution concentration increases from 0.5 to 2 M, the peak
power density increases from 7.3 to 56.3 W/m2. Because
the determined burst pressure is between 6.90 and 8.97 bar, the GOM
in its current state cannot withstand half the osmotic pressure differences.
The corresponding power density values were calculated for each hydraulic
pressure below the burst pressure. As shown in Figure 4b, the power density increases with the increase
of the hydraulic pressure on the draw solution side. Under a hydraulic
pressure of 6.90 bar, the membrane power density reaches 6.7, 12.8,
16.9, and 20.0 W/m2 when the NH4HCO3 draw solution concentrations are 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 M, respectively.
The power density values, when considering the burst pressure, are
lower than the peak values; however, they are higher than the power
density values from previous studies under similar conditions (Table S1).15,23,24,44

Figure 4 Power generation of the GOM. (a) Peak
power density values of the
GOM with different draw solution concentrations, (b) power density
values of the GOM under different applied hydraulic pressures, (c)
energy efficiency values with different draw solution concentrations
when the peak power density is achieved, and (d) energy efficiency
values of the GOM under different applied hydraulic pressures.

Energy efficiency of the osmotic
heat engine measures the ratio
of the thermal energy that can be converted into electricity. By assuming
that the temperature of the heat source is as low as 50 °C, an
energy efficiency analysis on the osmotic heat engine that incorporates
the GOM was conducted. It should be noted that according to our developed
model (SI1), the energy efficiency is not
influenced by the scale of the system. Instead, the system energy
efficiency was found to increase with the increase of applied hydraulic
pressure on the draw solution side (Figure S5b). When the applied hydraulic pressure equals the osmotic pressure
difference between the feed and draw solutions, the system energy
efficiency reaches its highest value (around 5%), though the power
density is almost zero under such hydraulic pressure. When the peak
power density is reached, the osmotic heat engine achieves an energy
efficiency of 2.48% (Figure 4c). The estimated optimal energy efficiency does not change
with the draw solution concentration. When a draw solution with higher
salt concentration is used, a higher peak power density can be achieved,
which is beneficial to energy generation. However, more thermal energy
is needed to regenerate the feed and draw solutions, making the overall
energy efficiency unchanged. The applied hydraulic pressure was found
to have a significant influence on energy efficiency: when the hydraulic
pressure increases, the energy efficiency also increases (Figure 4d). For example,
when the hydraulic pressure increases from 2.07 to 6.90 bar, the energy
efficiency increases from 0.41, 0.21, 0.14, and 0.10 to 1.38, 0.69,
0.46, and 0.35% with the draw solution concentrations of 0.5, 1, 1.5
and 2 M, respectively. Although the system energy efficiency keeps
increasing with the increase of the applied hydraulic pressure, the
power density decreases when the applied hydraulic pressure is larger
than half the osmotic pressure difference. At the same hydraulic pressure,
a lower draw solution concentration leads to higher energy efficiency;
this is because when the draw solution concentration is lower, less
energy is needed to regenerate the feed and draw solutions.

The osmotic heat engine outperforms existing technologies in terms
of the feasible working temperature. The system can generate electricity
from heat sources of very low temperature as long as the solutes can
be dissociated at such temperature. According to previous studies,
the NH4HCO3 solution can be ideally regenerated
at a temperature of about 50 °C.23 In this study, the membrane ICP is largely reduced by using the
freestanding GOM. The reduction of membrane ICP can significantly
increase the effective driving force across the membrane. For the
TFC membrane, high water flux and high power density can be achieved
when DI water is used as the feed solution in the PRO system.14 However, the current commercially available
TFC membranes are not powerful enough to completely prevent the reverse
salt permeation. When the salt ions transport across the membrane
active layer and accumulate inside the support layer, ICP occurs.12,45 Besides, it is a daunting task to eliminate all of the solutes from
the feed solution during the thermal separation process. Severe ICP
can significantly reduce the water flux and power density of the osmotic
heat engine. However, by using the freestanding GOM, a high water
flux can still be achieved even when the feed solution contains a
high concentration of salt ions (Figure 3c,d); thus, a high power density is guaranteed.
Because high power density in the osmotic heat engine is essential
to minimize facility cost and parasitic pumping losses,12 the enhanced power density in this study represents
a step forward toward the large-scale application of the technology.

The results from this study show that when the applied hydraulic
pressure is lower than half of the osmotic pressure difference, both
the power density and energy efficiency increase with the increase
of the applied hydraulic pressure. The burst pressure of the GOM became
the limiting factor for energy generation. The freestanding GOM in
its current state can only resist about 6.90 bar of hydraulic pressure
in the PRO system. The mechanical strength and thus the burst pressure
might be increased by increasing the GOM thickness. However, when
the GOM thickness increases, the water permeability coefficient decreases,
which would hinder the performance of the osmotic heat engine. In
addition, the low stability of the GOM in water has been singled out
as a key factor preventing the GOM from being applied on a large scale.
It is quite possible that the low stability of GOM in water and the
low burst pressure in the PRO system are related. Although GOM was
reported to have good mechanical properties in its dry state,46 the swelling of GOM upon hydration (indicated
by the XRD result in this study) can decrease its stability as well
as mechanical strength. Fortunately, many recent studies have focused
on increasing the stability and mechanical properties of the GO-related
membranes.47−49 The positive results from those studies can be readily
applied to design GOM with better performance. The high salt permeability
coefficient values of the GOM can hinder the system energy generation
performance. To minimize the reverse salt flux, a thermolytic salt
solution with reduced salt permeability coefficient, such as 1-cyclohexylpiperidine–H2CO3 solution, can be applied.50 By coupling the freestanding GOM with this draw solution,
the power output of the osmotic heat engine can be further enhanced.
Besides, the power generation results from this study are based on
coupon-scale measurements. It is recognized that the trade-off between
power density and energy efficiency is an intrinsic challenge to the
full-scale system and the average power output might be much lower
in full-scale operation.51,52 An evaluation of the
GOM impact in a larger scale system is necessary, and a better design
of the power generation system could enhance power generation under
field conditions.

To summarize, the current study explores the
suitability of a freestanding
GOM in the osmotic heat engine for low-grade waste heat harvesting.
Our efforts to develop GOM with good transport properties and high
power density are essential to the success and further enhancement
of system performance.

Conclusions
In summary, we have
synthesized and investigated the performance
of a freestanding GOM in the membrane-based osmotic heat engine. The
water and ion transport properties of the freestanding GOM have been
investigated. The GOM has an average water permeability coefficient
of 4.4 LMH-bar. Because of the elimination of the membrane support
layer, the ICP is largely minimized in the osmosis system. The GOM
can achieve high power density in the osmotic heat engine using ammonium
bicarbonate solution as the working fluid. Under an applied hydraulic
pressure of 6.90 bar, the membrane power density reaches 6.7, 12.8,
16.9, and 20.0 W/m2 when the draw solution concentrations
are 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 M, respectively. The system energy efficiency
was found to increase with the increase of the applied hydraulic pressure.
The current study concludes that the freestanding GOM is suitable
for application in the osmotic heat engine. However, future research
on the development of GO-based membranes with higher burst pressure
and better stability in water is needed to further advance this carbon-neutral
and transformative technology.

Experimental Section
Synthesis of GO Membranes
GO dispersions were synthesized
via a modified Hummer’s method for which graphite was oxidized
using a combination of sodium nitrate, concentrated sulfuric acid,
and potassium permanganate under a controlled reaction temperature.53,54 Then, hydrogen peroxide was added to terminate the oxidation reaction.
The mixture was then washed several times with DI water. Finally,
the precipitate was redispersed in DI water to form GO dispersion
with a concentration of 1 g/L.

The freestanding GOM was synthesized
by using a vacuum filtration method.35,55 The as-prepared
GO dispersion was first diluted with DI water and then filtrated through
an inorganic Whatman anodisc AAO 47-mm diameter filter with a 0.2
μm pore size (Whatman, Inc., Clifton, NJ, USA). The AAO filter
was proven successful when used to synthesize freestanding GOM with
good stability.35 The GOM can be easily
peeled off the AAO filter, forming a freestanding membrane after the
filtration process is complete. According to previous studies, the
water permeability coefficient of the GOM decreases with the increase
of membrane thickness;56,57 therefore, in this study, we
tried to synthesize freestanding GOM, making it as thin as possible
to ensure a high water permeability coefficient but, at the same time,
we kept enough thickness to ensure reasonable mechanical strength.

Characterization of GOM
GO chemistry was analyzed by
a K-Alpha X-ray photoelectron spectrometer system (K Alpha, Schaumburg,
IL, USA). SEM images were obtained on a Hitachi SU8010 field emission
SEM system (Hitachi High Technologies America, Inc., Schaumburg, IL).
The thickness of the GOM was determined via cross-sectional SEM images
and verified by using a micrometer. X-ray diffractometry was carried
out on a PANalytical X’Pert PRO Alpha-1 diffractometer (40
kV, 40 mA) (Malvern Panalytical B.V., Almelo, Netherlands) for both
dry and wet GOM samples. The wet sample was prepared by soaking the
GOM in DI water for 24 h before characterization.

Measurements
of GO Membrane Transport Properties
The
membrane water permeability coefficient (A) and salt
permeability coefficient (B) were measured via a
modified RO test cell by using DI water and salt solutions, respectively.
A previous study pointed out that in a conventional RO experiment,
the membrane does not deform because the permeate channel is supported
by a porous frit. Hence, the measured membrane A and B values in the RO testing cell would be different from
that of a deformed membrane in a PRO testing cell.58 In this study, the porous frit in the RO testing cell was
replaced by a porous mesh-type SEPA CF medium foulant spacer (Sterlitech
Corp., Kent, WA, USA) (Figure S2) to determine
the A and B values suitable for
PRO. The modified RO testing cell has an effective area of 4.1 cm2. During the experiment, the feed and permeate channels of
the modified RO testing cell acted as draw and feed solution channels
of the PRO cell, respectively (Figure S2). The influent feed solution was pressurized and circulated in the
feed channel with a flow rate of 400 mL/min, and the permeate was
weighted on a minute basis using a digital balance. DI water was used
as the permeate for the determination of the water permeability coefficient
(A). The weight change of the permeate was used to
calculate the water flux and water permeability coefficient. The membrane
was tested for 1 h under each applied hydraulic pressure (from 2.07
to 8.97 bar), and the water permeability coefficient (A) was determined by dividing the water flux by the hydraulic pressure
(A = JW/ΔP).43,59

The membrane was tested
under a hydraulic pressure of 3.45 bar (50 psi) for 1 h to determine
the salt permeability coefficient (B). The membrane
salt rejection (R) was tested in the modified RO
cell by using both sodium chloride solution (NaCl, 50 mM) and ammonium
bicarbonate solution (NH4HCO3, 50 mM). A conductivity
meter was used to measure the conductivity of the feed and permeate
solutions to calculate the membrane salt rejection.15 The salt permeability coefficient (B)
was then calculated by59,60 1  where ΔP is the hydraulic
pressure and Δπ is the osmotic pressure of the feed solution
in the modified RO test.

Determination of Water Flux and Projected
Power Density in the
PRO System
A customized counter-current cross-flow FO test
cell (8 cm in length and 4 cm in width) was used to measure the GOM
water flux. A silicon pad with a hole (1 cm × 1 cm) in the center
was inserted into the test cell to create an effective testing area
of 1 cm2. A mesh-type spacer was used inside both the feed
and draw solution chambers. During the experiment, the feed and draw
solutions were pumped into the chambers with a cross-flow velocity
of 27.8 cm/s. The weight and concentration change of the feed solution
were monitored by a digital balance and a conductivity meter to calculate
the water flux and (reverse) salt flux, respectively. The test was
run for at least 1 h for each measurement and the average value was
calculated.

The water flux was first measured with 1 M NaCl
as a draw solution and DI water as a feed solution. To investigate
the influence of solution pH on the water and salt transport across
the GOM, the pH of the feed and draw solutions was adjusted by adding
HCl or NaOH. Next, the water flux was measured by using NaCl and NH4HCO3 solutions at different concentrations of 0.5,
1, 1.5, and 2 M as draw solutions with DI water as the feed solution.
To evaluate how well the GOM can mitigate the ICP during PRO, NaCl
and NH4HCO3 solutions (0.1 M) were used as the
feed solutions. The corresponding water flux for each draw and feed
solution was calculated.

Additionally, the water flux and projected
power density for PRO
under hydraulic pressure was calculated using equations from previous
studies,43,61 specifically, by considering the effects
of ICP, external concentration polarization, and (reverse) salt permeation43 2  where JW is the
water flux, πF,b is the osmotic pressure of the bulk
feed solution, πD,b is the osmotic pressure of the
bulk draw solution, D is the bulk diffusion coefficient, S is the membrane structural parameter, k is the boundary layer mass transfer coefficient, and ΔP is the applied hydraulic pressure. The van’t Hoff
equation was used to calculate the osmotic pressure of the solutions
by assuming that the osmotic pressure is linearly proportional to
the salt ion concentration.43 The value
of k was determined by using a previously reported
procedure;29 the value was determined to
be 26.8 μm/s. In the PRO system, the power density (W) is the product of the water flux across the membrane
and the applied hydraulic pressure on the draw solution side 3  

Estimation of System Energy Efficiency
The osmotic
heat engine consumes thermal energy to separate the solute from the
mixed solution and to generate power by mixing the diluted solution
and pressurized concentrated solution.9 The energy efficiency of the overall system can be expressed as 4  where η is the energy efficiency
of
the osmotic heat engine, P is the energy generated
from the electricity generation stage, and qH is the thermal energy consumed to (re)generate the draw and
feed solutions. By analysis of the osmotic heat engine process in
this study (Figure S3), the energy efficiency
can be calculated by 5  where β is the specific heat duty of
ammonium bicarbonate, cd is the concentration
of the draw solution, and cf is the concentration
of the feed solution. Equation 5 indicates that the energy efficiency is independent of the
membrane area and operation time. The detailed calculation of the
system energy efficiency is shown in the Supporting Information (SI1).
