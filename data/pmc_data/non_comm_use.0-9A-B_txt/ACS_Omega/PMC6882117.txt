This
paper investigates merits of using a wood-based biocrude (WB)
from aspen wood to improve the compatibility of halloysite nanotubes
(HNTs) with high-impact polystyrene to develop nanocomposites with
desirable thermomechanical properties. Morphological, thermal, and
rheological properties of the resulting nanocomposite are used as
indicators of the compatibility and dispersion of the modified HNT
within the polymer matrix. Computational modeling using density functional
theory is used along with laboratory experiments to provide a multiscale
characterization of the above biocrude and nanocomposites. Studies
performed through dispersion-corrected density functional theory calculations
show that the active functional groups of WB molecules including carbonyl,
hydroxyl, and carboxylic interact with the HNT surface, while their
aromatic tails interact with the phenyl groups of the polystyrene.
Furthermore, the studies reveal how WB molecules act as bridges between
the hydrophobic polymer and the hydrophilic clay improving the compatibility.
The latter was confirmed by Hansen solubility parameters and was evidenced
in improved dispersion of clay within the polystyrene matrix observed
by microscopy. Rheological and thermal analyses of the modified HNT
and nanocomposites showed physical interactions of WB with HNT surface
as well as interactions between the WB-modified HNT and the high-impact
polystyrene. The WB was found to be a strong candidate as a green
compatibilizing agent for HNT in high-impact polystyrene. The study
results can provide insights for formulators and manufacturers looking
for green compatibilizing agents in conventional nanocomposites for
construction and manufacturing applications.

1 Introduction
Nanocomposites
with improved thermal, rheological, and mechanical
properties have been a focus of research, especially due to the recent
development of novel surface-modified nanofillers.1,2 Halloysite
nanotubes (HNTs) are low-cost, environmentally friendly, and readily
available nanofillers with a chemical structure similar to that of
kaolinite, except that the structure is rolled into a hollow tube
instead of a sheet. HNTs have a molecular formula of Al2Si2O5(OH)4·nH2O. The external surface is composed of siloxane (−Si–O–Si−),
and the internal surface is aluminol (−Al–OH).3−6 The tubular structure and external siloxane surface with few OH
groups improve the natural dispersion of HNT.5 However, due to the negatively charged external surface, HNTs typically
have poor compatibility with some hydrophobic polymers. Surface modification
via van der Waals forces, hydrogen bonding, and electrostatic attractions
can improve the compatibility issue.7 Previous
studies have shown that pure HNT without modification will agglomerate
when mixed with hydrophobic polymers, which negatively affects the
thermal and mechanical properties of the mixture.8

High-impact polystyrene (HiPS) is an important thermoplastic
polymer
that is extensively used in products in fields such as transportation,
electronic packaging, automobiles, and household appliances.9,10 HiPS is an immiscible, phase-separated polymer blend with major
polystyrene (PS) and minor polybutadiene (PBD) phases; most commercial
HiPSs have about 4–12% PBD.11 The
introduction of nanofillers such as HNT in the polymer to enhance
its properties has been regularly practiced.3−6 However, the compatibility between
HNT and the polymer (HiPS) is a concern due to the hydrophilic nature
of the clay, although different types of modifiers have been introduced
to enhance the compatibility of HNT and HiPS.12,13

In this study, a wood-based biocrude (WB) is used as a new
modifier
acting as a bridge between HNT and HiPS. The specific hypothesis is
that the compatibility of HNT and HiPS will be improved when a biocompatiblizing
agent is used. This in turn enhances the sustainability of conventional
nanocomposites.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Structures and Morphologies of the Pure and
WB-Modified HNTs
2.1.1 X-ray Diffraction (XRD)
The diffraction
patterns of the nanoclays are shown in Figure 1. It can be observed that the diffraction
patterns of modified nanoclays were almost identical to those of the
raw HNT, except at around 3–8° 2θ. No peaks in this area were present
for the OHNTWB 33, while the OHNTWB 50 and OHNTWB 66 have two broad
peaks at 5.43–5.61 and 4.33–4.39°, respectively.
This could indicate better dispersion and less agglomeration of the
OHNTWB 33 compared to the OHNTWB 50 and OHNTWB 66. The unchanged diffraction
patterns of the modified halloysite nanoclays indicate that modification
did not change the interior lumen of the HNTs. This result could mean
that either grafting of the WB occurred only on the outer silica surface
or the WB entered only the interior lumens without unraveling the
tubular structure of the HNT. Similar results of both scenarios are
reported in other studies.14,15

HNT and WB-modified HNTs.

2.1.2 Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS)
Results
of the DLS measurements of the pure and modified nanoclays
are listed in Table 1. A reduction in the average particle size of modified nanoclays
was observed with an increasing amount of WB. The typical dimensions
of the nanotubes are in the range of 0.1–15 μm, with
an inner diameter of 5–30 nm and an outer diameter of 30–70
nm.16 The decrease in average particle
size can be interpreted as a sign of de-agglomeration and enhanced
dispersion.17,18 It can be seen that the introduction
of WB reduced the average particle size from that of pure HNT (d, 440 nm) to 347, 351, and 282 as the concentration of
WB increased. Also, the polydispersity was the lowest for the sample
with the highest WB dosage, indicating a narrower and more uniform
distribution of the particles associated with reduced agglomerations.
Although the scenario with the highest concentration of WB (OHNTWB
66) showed the smallest average particle size, this scenario was not
the most stable. In fact, OHNTWB 33 showed the highest stability,
as evidenced by the largest ζ-potential of −5.49, which
indicates the strongest electrostatic charges giving rise to repulsion
forces and preventing agglomeration.

2.1.3 Attenuated Total Reflectance
Fourier Transform
Infrared (ATR-FTIR) Spectroscopy
The FTIR analysis of the
pure and modified HNTs (Figure 2) shows that the HNTs exhibit characteristic absorption bands
near 1092, 1030, and 910 cm–1 that are associated
with the stretching vibration of Si–O bonds and flexural vibrations
of Al–OH.19 The stretching vibrations
at 3695 cm–1 associated with the inner surface OH
groups and the stretching bands at 3622 cm–1 of
the inner Al–OH groups are present in all nanoclays. The bands
at around 3650 and 3670 cm–1 (Figure 2A, black circle) are the characteristic of
the opening and modification of the HNT lumen,3,14,20−22 although the peaks are
very small.

Figure 2 FTIR analysis of pure WB, pure HNT, and the WB-modified HNT clays
in the (A) 3000–4000 cm–1 range and (B) 900–1200
cm–1 range.

In Figure 2B, the
peak at 940 cm–1 is associated with the OH deformation
of the inner surface hydroxyl group. This peak becomes more visible
with increasing dosages of WB. The peak at 912 cm–1 is associated with the OH deformation of inner hydroxyl groups;
this peak shifts toward higher wavelengths with increasing dosages
of WB. A peak for the in-plane Si–O stretching at 1070 cm–1 shifts toward higher wavelengths and becomes more
visible with increasing dosages of WB.

The results of the analyses
of the morphologies and structures
of the modified nanoclays indicate that several compounds of the WB
have been grafted on the outer surface and small amounts could have
entered the interior lumen of the HNT.

2.2 Thermal
Properties of the Pure and WB-Modified
HNTs
The increase in WB concentration among the three samples
leads to a reduction in the thermal resistance of the nanocomposites.
The three modified nanoclays show very similar thermal resistance,
with OHNTWB 66 showing a small drop of 1% mass loss at around 200
°C, indicating that at a high concentration of WB, some excess
biocrude may be trapped inside the halloysite nanotubes, contributing
to a slight loss of mass (Table 2).

Table 2 TG Analysis of the WB, HNT, and WB-Modified
HNTs
temperature range <1000 °C	
 	[°C]	mass loss
[%]	
WB	146.0	87.0	
HNT	449.4	17.3	
OHNTWB 33	139.2	42.5	
OHNTWB 50	139.7	43.7	
OHNTWB 66	139.7	43.9	
Despite
the differences in WB concentration, the mass loss is nearly
the same at all registered processing temperatures (Table 3); it could be concluded that
only the excess WB is removed from the exterior surfaces of the HNT,
and the remaining residual masses contain primarily HNT with bonded
compatibilizer molecules. Other studies have found that an increase
in the WB concentration decreased the loss of organic residue in the
range 100–300 °C from evaporation or decomposition of
the molecules of the modifier; this study also found that result,
but the decreases in modified clay in these regions were small in
comparison with those of the other studies.7,23

Residual Masses at 80, 230, 600, and 1000 °C of the Pure and

OHNTWB 66	0.6	99.4	16.6	83.4	42.8	57.2	43.9	56.1	
The changes in the structure and
morphologies of the modified OHNT
compared to those of the pure HNT show that organic modification and
grafting of WB were successful.

2.3 Hansen
Solubility Parameter (HSP) Analysis
of the Interaction between WB Compounds and Polystyrene
Hansen
solubility parameters (HSPs) can be used as a preliminary compatibility
assessment tool to test whether a polymer is soluble and compatible
with intercalant compounds.24 The solubility
hypothesis assumes that a surface-treated nanoparticle will be compatible
with a polymer if the backbone of the molecules on the nanoparticle
surface is a solvent for the polymer. Table S1 (Supporting Information) lists the calculated values of the relative
energy difference (RED) between the known components in WB and PS;
PS is the closest polymer analogue available for HiPS. The fractional
HSP values plotted in Figure 3 suggest that the WB ketone compounds are the most compatible
with PS. However, the PS also matches with some other oxygenated aromatics
in the WB, which was described by Pedersen and co-workers.25 This information suggests that the aromatic
groups of PS are the most compatible with selected compounds of the
WB.

Figure 3 Teas chart showing the fractional HSP values of PS and WB compounds.

2.4 Molecular Modeling
In this section,
we show how biomodification using wood-based crude oil can increase
the compatibility of halloysite nanoclay with polystyrene (PS). Fractional
HSP values (Figure 3) show that the oxygenated aromatics and ketones of WB are most compatible
with PS; therefore, we use these molecules as model compounds to study
the bridging role of WB between HNT and PS. It should be noted that
the adsorption of the organic molecules (PS and WB) mainly occurs
on the outer surface of the HNT containing O–Si–O groups.
The inner surface of HNT containing Al–OH groups has limited
space, and its active sites are not as accessible as those on the
outer layer.

The PS model compound contains five repeating units
from the polymer molecule. Since each WB molecule has a chance to
interact with just a small part of the polymer, and the interaction
between the polymer and the HNT surface is defined as interaction
per surface area, this model properly describes the interacting constituents
in the system.

Depending on the arrangement of the pendent (phenyl)
groups along
the backbone chain of the polymer, three tacticities are defined for
the polystyrene: isotactic, where the phenyl groups are arranged on
one side of the polymer; syndiotactic, where phenyl groups are hanging
from alternating sides of the polymer backbone chain; and atactic,
where phenyl groups are randomly arranged. Based on dispersion-corrected
density functional theory (DFT-D) at the BPE/DNP level using DMol3, our calculations show that the syndiotactic arrangement
for the PS model compound is more stable than that of its counterpart
with the isotactic arrangement by 19.7 kcal/mol (Figure 7). In practice, the higher
thermodynamic stability of syndiotactic PS compared to isotactic PS
manifests itself in higher crystallization rate (2 orders of magnitude)
and higher melting point of syndiotactic PS (275 °C) compared
to the isotactic PS (240 °C).26 Therefore,
the syndiotactic conformer was chosen as the PS model in this study. Figure 4 shows that the carbon
atoms of the optimized structures of isotactic or syndiotactic are
not in a straight or zigzag link.

Figure 4 Initial and fully optimized conformers
of the PS model employed
in this study. Based on the DFT-D calculations at the BPE/DNP level,
the syndiotactic configuration is thermodynamically more stable than
the isotactic configuration by 19.7 kcal/mol.

It has been documented that when the surface of
montmorillonite
clay is treated with a particular biomodifier, an organophilic environment
is created around the clay that improves the hydrophobic nature of
the polymer, causing the polymer to be adsorbed onto the clay.27,28 In other words, molecules of the compatibilizer act as a bridge
between the hydrophobic polymer and the hydrophilic clay (Figure 5).

Figure 5 Interaction of the polystyrene
model molecule with the surface
of halloysite nanotubes in the presence of the selected molecules
of wood-based biomodifier (WB).

Components identified in aspen wood include functional
groups such
as carbonyl (C=O), hydroxyl (OH), carboxylic (COOH), and phenyl
groups. It is not expected that these polar groups would be attracted
to silicon oxide groups of the HNT surface through electrostatic and
van der Waals forces such as H-bonding and dipole–dipole interactions.
The components of WB are attached to the HNT surface by their active
functional groups from one side and to the polymer by their aromatic
tail from the other side. However, the main question raised is how
the inactive tails of WB molecules interact with the rather bulky
pendent (phenyl) groups of the PS that are hanging from the polymer
backbone chain. To answer this question, we will focus on the interaction
mechanism between polystyrene and WB molecules.

Table 4 shows the
results of the DFT-based molecular modeling for interaction between
some selected WB molecules and phenyl groups of the PS. WB molecules
chosen in this molecular modeling are among the oxygenated aromatics
and ketones that are found in abundance in aspen wood. The extended
transition state–natural orbital of chemical valence (ETS-NOCV)
technique was used to decompose the total binding energy between two
fragments into its components: electrostatic interaction (ΔEelstat), Pauli repulsion (ΔEPauli), orbital interaction (ΔEorb), and dispersion (ΔEdisp) energies (Table 4).

Table 4 Energy Decomposition Results, at the
BPE-D3/DZP Level, for the Interaction of the Polystyrene Model and
Some Selected Components of Wood-Derived Biocrude (WB) Belonging to
the Oxygenated Aromatic and Ketone Categoriesa
a All energies are in kcal/mol.

In the aromatic group, the electrostatic and dispersion
interactions
contribute significantly to the total binding energy (see ΔEelstat and ΔEdisp, respectively). This could be due to the electrostatic interactions
between aromaticities of the face-to-face phenyl rings. Almost all
energy components related to the aromatic group show higher values
compared to their counterparts in nonaromatic cyclic ketones, indicating
the significance of oxygenated aromatics in establishing an appropriate
overlap between π densities of WB and PS fragments.

It
should be further noted that although the aromatic components
of WB benefit from the π–π interaction with phenyl
groups of the PS, their interaction energy is not much higher than
that of cyclic nonaromatic ketones. It was found that a part of this
energy is coming from the π–H interactions between the
π electronic density of the PS phenyl rings and H of the cyclic
nonaromatic compounds of WB. Additionally, in the case of 2-cyclopenten-1-one,
3,4-dimethyl, shown in Table 4, π conjugated orbitals of the WB molecule use their
ability to overlap with π orbitals of the PS polymer. Therefore,
the energy terms shown in Table 4 verify the effective binding interactions between
special compounds of WB and the PS polymer.

2.5 Rheological
Properties of the OHNT/HiPS Nanocomposites
The rheological
analysis of the HiPS nanocomposites shown in Figure 6 confirms the interactions
between modified nanoclay and the polymer matrix, which, in turn,
supports the findings of the HSP and molecular modeling. The observed
interactions are evidenced by a deviation from the low-frequency plateau,
indicating the formation of a soft solid in the HiPS nanocomposite
mixed with OHNTWB 33. These formations are related to improved thermal
and mechanical properties of the resulting nanocomposite, due to the
better compatibility and dispersion of the nanoclays with the polymer
matrix.9,28−30 However, such an interaction
was not observed with an increased amount of WB, as the HiPS OHNTWB
50 and 66 nanocomposites did not show soft-solid formation. This could
be due to a thicker surfactant layer that increases the molecular
spacing between the clay and polymer while also reducing the electrostatic
charge of the clay surface. This thicker surfactant layer could be
the result of inadequate mixing or excess compatibilizer after surface
modification. Another possible explanation for the reduced interaction
and viscosity could be the release of stored WB from inside the HNTs.
This excess compatibilizer could reduce the interaction between the
polymer and HNT, or it could soften the matrix by dissolving into
the polymer.

Figure 6 Complex viscosity versus angular frequency for average
values of
the HiPS nanocomposites.

The reduced complex viscosity
at high frequencies for the HiPS-HNT
composite compared to the pure polymer indicates that there is particle-induced
viscosity reduction. This phenomenon was first reported by Mackay and co-workers,31 where a relatively
small amount of nanoparticles can lead to a significant particle-induced
reduction in viscosity compared to the viscosity of the polymer matrix.
The reduction is due to the clay agglomerating and producing flocculated
structures that have a fractal influence on the viscosity via an increase
in apparent volume. This can be explained by the Kriger–Dougherty-modified
Einstein equation for the influence of packing fraction on viscosity
for filled systems.32 The agglomerated
structure of the HNT is evidenced by DLS measurements showing the
largest particle size and a low ζ-potential for the pure HNT.
The WB-grafted HNTs achieved a better dispersion within the HiPS matrix,
which could lead to improved properties of the nanocomposites.

2.6 Structures and Morphologies of the OHNT/HiPS
Nanocomposites
2.6.1 TEM
TEM images
of the HiPS nanocomposites
reveal that the nanotubes were most thoroughly dispersed in the OHNTWB
33 nanocomposite (Figure 7). The enhanced dispersion is attributed
to the presence of high electrostatic forces in this scenario, as
evidenced by the ζ-potential. Such an enhancement is also reflected
in the rheological properties showing a significant enhancement of
the viscosity for this specific nanocomposite. In addition, large
nanotube aggregates were regularly found in each of the nanocomposite
formulations, except for HiPS OHNTWB 33 (see Figure S1, Supporting Information). The nanotubes often appeared hollow
or collapsed rather than filled or exfoliated; however, the structure
of individual nanotubes did not show noticeable differences among
the three nanocomposites (Figure S2, Supporting
Information).

sections
of HiPS nanocomposites with (a) pure HNT, (b) OHNTWB 33, (c) OHNTWB
50, and (d) OHNTWB 66. All images have the same magnification. The
inset in (c) is 125 nm wide and shows a magnified image of a sectioned
nanotube.

2.6.2 ATR-FTIR
The FTIR analysis of the
nanocomposites in Figure 8 shows the appearance of a broad peak (I) due to polar compounds
(e.g., alcohols or carboxylic acids) present in the nanocomposites
with the lowest amounts of WB (33 and 50%) in the modified nanoclays.

Figure 8 FTIR analysis
of HiPS nanocomposites in the (A) 500–4000
cm–1 range and (B) 800–2000 cm–1 range.

Specific peaks, as indicated with
arrows in Figure 8B,
were found in the II range. The OH deformation
of water from HNT was found at 1650 cm–1, but it
increases in intensity and shifts. Three peaks appear in the nanocomposites
that are specifically related to the modified nanoclay: a peak from
WB ketones at 1716 cm–1, a peak at 1470 cm–1 associated with deformation (scissoring) of CH2, and
a peak at 1120 cm–1 from perpendicular Si–O
stretching from HNTs. These peaks increase and shift in composites.12,33

However, the HiPS/OHNT/WB 33 presented a new peak at 1045
cm–1 that is associated with Si–O–C.34 This may indicate a strong bonding between the
nanoclay and either WB compounds or HiPS that developed during blending.
Such bonding would also further explain the interaction between modified
OHNTWB 33 and the HiPS that is observed in the rheological results.

The results of the rheological and analyses of the structures and
morphologies of the OHNT/HiPS demonstrated that interactions between
the OHNTs and HiPS were achieved.

2.7 Thermal
Properties of the OHNT/HiPS Nanocomposites
Thermogravimetric
analysis of the HiPS nanocomposites showed that
the composites undergo one primary thermal decomposition stage at
about 410–420° (Table 5). The addition of WB slightly increases the decomposition
temperatures of nanocomposites. These results align with those of
prior studies.12,35 The HiPS nanocomposites showed
improved thermal resistance with an increasing dosage of WB. This
may be attributed to the improved dispersion and compatibility of
clay in the polymer.

3 Conclusions
The paper investigated
the merits
of using wood-based biocrude
(WB) produced from biorenewable and sustainable resources such as
aspen wood, as a modifier for halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) to improve
the compatibility of HNT with polymeric matrixes. A nanocomposite
with the biomodified HNT and high-impact polystyrene was produced.
Hansen solubility parameters combined with molecular modeling showed
that WB’s ketone compounds and oxygenated aromatics are compatible
with polystyrene. Molecular modeling and morphological analyses show
that functional groups of the WB including carbonyl, hydroxyl, and
carboxylic activate the HNT surface, while the aromatic tail of these
molecules establishes bonding interactions with phenyl groups of the
HiPS. Nanocomposites incorporating HNT modified with 33% WB showed
enhanced dispersion and reduced agglomeration. The observed improvement
was attributed to the improved compatibility and stronger interactions
due to the presence of a biocompatiblizing agent. It should be noted
that there is a peak point beyond which addition of WB could lead
to reduction in thermal resistance. The latter reduction is attributed
to excess compatibilizer promoting degradation. Overall, wood-based
biocrude was found to be a promising candidate as a modifier for the
halloysite clay used in high-impact polystyrene. The results of this
study can enable designers and manufacturers to properly incorporate
biomodifiers such as those made from aspen wood to enhance the performance
and sustainability of nanocomposites commonly used in construction
and manufacturing.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials
The high-impact polystyrene
(HiPS) used in this study is Polystyrene 6540 from Total Petrochemicals.
It has a melt flow index (MFI) of 12 g/10 min measured at 200 °C
and a specific density of 1.04 g/cm3. Unmodified halloysite
nanotubes (HNTs) were acquired from Naturalnano Inc. The wood-derived
biocrude (WB) was obtained through glycerol-assisted aspen wood liquefaction
as reported elsewhere.36 The WB was produced
at 400 °C, 300 bars, in a continuous reactor with a residence
time of approximately 15 min. Wood and glycerol were processed in
a 50/50 mass ratio with a potassium carbonate catalyst. After processing,
the biocrude and aqueous phases were separated gravimetrically and
fractionated. The heavy residue is referred to as WB in this study. More information about the fractional distillation and chemical characterization
of WB can be found in ref.25

4.2 Preparation of Nanocomposites and Samples
4.2.1 Organic
Surface Modification of HNT with
WB
Three batches of modified nanoclay with different WB concentrations
were prepared. For each batch, a specified amount of HNT and WB was
mixed in a 1:1 water/ethanol suspension. For each gram of HNT, 50
mL of deionized water was added to the clay and mixed by magnetic
stirring for 25 min at 80 °C; the suspension was left to settle
for approximately 24 h. The mixture was reheated for 5 min and mixed
with a second solution of 10 mL of ethanol per gram of WB for 15 min.
After mixing, sonication was performed with an ultrasonic horn for
2 min; the mixture was again left to settle for 24 h. All mixtures
were then centrifuged for 60 min at 5000 rpm, and the sediment-modified
nanoclay was collected and dried at room temperature. The collected
modified nanoclays were ground by hand into fine powders for further
processing and characterization. The weights of HNT and WB in each
of the three batches are shown in Table 6.

4.2.2 Preparation of OHNT/HiPS
Nanocomposites
The HiPS nanocomposites were processed via
melt blending and compounding
to obtain a masterbatch with a high concentration of modified nanoclay.
The compounding was performed using an MC 15 Micro compounder from
Xplore at 230 °C and a speed of 200 rpm, with a residence time
of 180 s. This was followed by dilution using an extrusion process
to a 5% filler concentration. The extrusion process was done with
a Prism Euro-lab 16 twin-screw extruder from Thermo Scientific at
230 °C. This was followed by an injection molding to produce
samples for characterization. The injection molding was done using
a MiniJet Pro Piston Injection Molding System from HAAKR at 230 °C
and 600 bars for 20 s. The postpressure was applied for 20 s at 600
bars with a tensile bar mold (ISO 527-2-5A) at 30 °C.

4.3 Characterization Techniques
4.3.1 Rheological
Properties
The measurements
were conducted to study potential interactions between the modified
nanoclays and HiPS polymer, using a Paar Physica MCR 500 rheometer.
A cone-and-plate configuration with a 25 mm diameter 2° cone
and a gap of 0.105 mm was used for the measurements. The temperature
setting was 230 °C for HiPS, and the measurements were performed
in a frequency range of 600–0.06 rad/s using a 5% strain. The
material was placed on the plate and left to melt for 180 s, after
which the gap was set, and the system was left for 300 s to reach
thermal equilibrium. All measurements were performed with three repetitions,
and the average value for each material is reported.

4.3.2 X-ray Diffraction (XRD)
XRD measurements
to investigate the crystalline structures and properties of the nanoclays
and nanocomposites were performed using an Empyrean diffractometer
from PANalytical with a Cu Kα radiation running at 45 kV and
40 mA.

4.3.3 Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)
The TEM analysis was done using a Zeiss Libra 120 transmission
electron microscope operating at 120 kV. To prepare samples, an RMC
Boeckeler PT-PC PowerTome ultramicrotome was used to cut sections
roughly 80–100 nm thick of the HiPS nanocomposites for TEM
imaging. The sections were picked up using 200-mesh copper TEM grids
and coated with 8 nm of carbon using a Leica EM ACE200 coating system.

4.3.4 Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform
Infrared (ATR-FTIR) Spectroscopy
To assess the surface modification
of the nanoclay and the interactions between the nanoclays and the
HiPS, the functional groups were determined using a PerkinElmer Spectrum
One spectrometer. A zinc selenide crystal was used in absorbance mode
with a resolution of 4 cm–1 and four scans per measurement
in the 500–4000 cm–1 range.

4.3.5 Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS)
The average ζ-potential
and particle sizes of the pure and
modified nanoclays were determined using a Malvern Zetasizer Nano
ZS DLS. For each sample, 0.1 mg of clay was diluted in 15 mL of ethanol
and then ultrasonicated for 20 min. The suspension was filled into
the drip cell, and the analyses were conducted at room temperature.

4.3.6 Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)
Thermal
properties were determined using a Discovery TGA from TA
Instruments, using platinum pans in a nitrogen atmosphere with a continuous
flow of 10 mL/min. The temperature range was 40–1000 °C
for the modified nanoclays and 40–600 °C for the nanocomposite,
with a heating rate of 10 °C/min.

4.4 Compatibility
Studies
The Yamamoto-Molecular
Break (Y-MB) method was used to determine the Hansen solubility parameters
(HSPs) of WB compounds using the HSPiP software. The HSP consists
of three different parameters: dispersive (δD), polar (δP), and hydrogen bond (δH) cohesive forces. The compatibility between two materials
can be assessed based on the relative energy difference (RED) given
in eq 1, where a RED
value greater than 1 indicates compatibility. 1  where the Hansen distance (Ra) between the compounds of WB and the polymer is calculated
with eq 2. 2  where ΔδX12 is the difference between the individual
HSP values of the
HiPS and the WB compounds.

The interaction radius of the polymer
(Ro) was set to 12.7, based on a theoretical
generalization of polystyrene.

A secondary way to visualize
compatibility is to calculate the
fractional HSP (fδX) of the compounds and plot them in a ternary diagram (Teas chart).
The fractional HSP can be calculated with the following three equations.  

4.5 Computational Methods
Geometries
of the monomers and all interacting constituents were fully optimized
using the DMol3 module37,38 of the Accelrys
Materials Studio program package (version 6.0). At the generalized
gradient approximation (GGA) level, the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
(PBE) functional,39 Grimme’s dispersion
corrections,40 and double-numerical polarized
(DNP) basis set were used for the optimization process.

The
extended transition state–natural orbital of chemical valence
(ETS-NOCV) approach, implemented in the Amsterdam density functional
(ADF),41 was subsequently performed on
the molecules optimized in the previous step.

In the ETS-NOCV
technique, the total binding energy is further
decomposed into its chemically meaningful energy components, shown
in eq 3. 3  where Eelstat is
the electrostatic interaction, EPauli is
the Pauli repulsion, and Eorb is the dispersion
interaction.

All ETS-NOCV calculations were performed at the
dispersion-corrected
PBE level including all-electron contracted double zeta valence plus
polarization (DZP) function basis sets, the PBE-D3/DZP level.
