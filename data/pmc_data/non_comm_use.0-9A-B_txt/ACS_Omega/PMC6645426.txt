Understanding the molecular basis
of the thermal stability and
functionality of redox proteins has important practical applications.
Here, we show a distinct thermal dependence of the spectroscopic and
electrochemical properties of two plastocyanins from the thermophilic
cyanobacterium Phormidium laminosum and their mesophilic counterpart from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, despite the similarity of their molecular structures.
To explore the origin of these differences, we have mimicked the local
hydrophobicity in the east patch of the thermophilic protein by replacing
a valine of the mesophilic plastocyanin by isoleucine. Interestingly,
the resulting mutant approaches the thermal stability, redox thermodynamics,
and dynamic coupling of the flexible site motions of the thermophilic
protein, indicating the existence of a close connection between the
hydrophobic packing of the east patch region of plastocyanin and the
functional control and stability of the oxidized and reduced forms
of the protein.

1 Introduction
Understanding the structural
and molecular factors that modulate
the thermal stability and activity of redox proteins is of high scientific
and technological interest.1−4 Plastocyanin (Pc) is a member of the blue copper
protein family and acts as an electron carrier in oxygenic photosynthesis.5 Despite their structural similarities, Pc from
the thermophilic cyanobacterium Phormidium laminosum (Pho-Pc) displays a higher thermal stability than
its counterpart from mesophilic Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (Syn-Pc), as well
as a different dependence of the melting point on the redox state.6,7 Copper ligands are known to play a key role in the thermal stability
of blue copper proteins,2,8−10 and they are highly conserved in Pcs. On the other hand, molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations suggest that small structural differences
in the flexible loop L5 (see Figure 1) can modulate the stability of the active copper site
and contribute to the protein’s thermal response.7,11 This loop is far from the copper center and takes part in the so-called
east patch, also known as site 2 in functional analysis. Further,
the triple mutant A44D/D49P/A62L of Syn-Pc,12 designed by sequence comparison to stabilize
the redox behavior of the protein during crystallization trials, displays
a conformation of loop L5 similar to that found in the structure in
the solution of the wild-type (WT) species (Figure 1).

in orange sticks.

This indirect control
was evident when inducing a thermal destabilization
of the thermophilic protein after introducing a single mutation in
the east patch.15 Further X-ray absorption
spectroscopy investigations revealed that this mutation induces a
subtle change in the local geometry of the Cu-binding site, which
then causes the thermal stabilization.16 Nevertheless, the mechanism that allows this flexible region, located
far from the metal active center, to regulate the protein’s
thermal stability is not fully understood.

Here, we have investigated
the thermostability and redox properties
of Pcs by variable-temperature cyclic voltammetry and fluorescence
and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopic measurements. Notably, the
thermophilic and mesophilic variants display different thermal dependence
of the spectroscopic and electrochemical properties. To dig into the
structural factors causing these differences, we have analyzed the
effect of replacing the amino acid Val48 of Syn-Pc
by isoleucine (V48I Syn-Pc). Considering that Val48
is located between loops L5 and L7 in the east patch of Syn-Pc, this mutation aims at stabilizing the mesophilic variant by
introducing an extra methylene group between the two aforementioned
loops, thereby trying to mimic the local hydrophobicity of the thermophilic
variant (see Figure 1). The loops L1 and L5 are the areas with the highest fluctuations
in all Pcs. In the vicinity of the L5 loop of Syn-Pc, there is a cavity in which two water molecules are intercalated
that interact with the residues of the L5 and L7 loops and form a
network of hydrogen bridges. The L5 loop has a three-residue insert
that allows the formation of a hydrophobic cluster consisting of residues
Phe80, Val48, Ile55, Pro81, Pro49, and Tyr85 in Pho-Pc. However, such grouping is reduced to Tyr79, Val48, and Pro76
in Syn-Pc. The inclusion of an extra methylene group
by the substitution of valine 48 in Syn-Pc by an
isoleucine is expected to reduce the gap between the L5 loop and the
barrel, thereby increasing the hydrophobic interactions in the cluster,
decreasing its solvation, and reinforcing the van der Waals interactions
among the residues in this area. The consequences of this mutation
on the flexibility and mobility of the protein structure have been
analyzed further by MD.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Thermal Stability of Pcs
The thermal
stabilities of oxidized and reduced Pcs are characterized by their
melting points (Tm). The thermal stabilities
of Pcs were investigated by monitoring the change in the intensity
of fluorescence of tryptophan 31, a residue located within the hydrophobic
pocket occluded by the east patch loop of Pc. The tryptophan fluorescence
shift and intensity are, in fact, indicative of the exposure of its
indol ring to the external aqueous environment.17 Complementarily, CD was also used to detect the changes
in the secondary structure during thermal unfolding. In particular,
we followed the changes in the β-strand content upon increasing
the temperature.18Figure 2 illustrates the normalized unfolding curves
obtained by the fluorescence and CD measurements of the oxidized and
reduced forms of the three Pcs. The normalized thermal unfolding curves
were fitted to a simple two-state unfolding model19 to estimate the melting points (Tm) of the Pcs according to the following equation 1  where S is the protein signal
at a given temperature (T), Su and Sf are the signals of protein
solutions of equal concentration of either unfolded or folded protein,
and ΔGf is the free-energy difference
of the equilibrium between the unfolded conformation and the native
conformation. This free energy is approximated by the integrated Gibbs–Helmholtz
equation 2  where Tm, ΔHTm, and ΔCP are the melting temperature,
enthalpy change, and heat capacity change of the specific equilibrium,
respectively. To fit the thermal unfolding curves of each Pc, we have
simplified eq 2 by considering
that ΔCP ≈
0, so that ΔG ≈ ΔHTm(1 – T/Tm). Moreover, we have considered that Sf = Sf0 + mf(T – T0) to account for
the linear dependence of the CD signal of the folded protein prior
to its thermal unfolding, where Sf0 is the signal of native molecules
at the low temperature T0 and mf is the slope of the spectroscopic signal showing
a linear dependence with temperature.

spectroscopy (circles)
and fluorescence (triangles) of Pc species. The filled and open symbols
(black and blue) correspond to the oxidized and reduced proteins,
respectively. The open orange circles represent the CD data corresponding
to the respective apoproteins. The lines are fits using a two-state
equilibrium model.19

The fitting parameters used to quantify the thermal unfolding
curves
of Pcs are listed in Table 1. The estimated Tm values of the
oxidized and reduced forms of the protein by the two different spectroscopic
techniques are somewhat different, but display similar qualitative
trends (see Table 1). According to their Tm values, the
oxidized form of Pho-Pc is more stable in solution
than the reduced one, whereas the mesophilic variant shows the opposite
trend, in agreement with previous works.6,7,11,15 Interestingly, the
V48I mutation increases the thermal stability of Syn-Pc. In particular, the oxidized V48I mutant is characterized by
a higher Tm value than the oxidized Syn-Pc WT protein, whereas the Tm values of the reduced mutant and WT proteins were similar. This
yields a smaller difference between the Tm values of the two redox forms in the mutant.

It should be noted that the normalized thermal unfolding
curves
obtained by the two different spectroscopic techniques for both oxidized
and reduced forms of the three Pcs cannot be superimposed. These observations
may indicate the presence of intermediate states at least in the Syn-Pc
species. In fact, our data indicate that the regular structures disorder
before Trp31 indol becomes accessible to the solvent. The opposite
occurs for the oxidized Pho-Pc species. The larger
slope of the CD curves is indicative of a high cooperativity, which
involves the hydrogen bonds stabilizing the β-barrel fold. This
agrees with the larger enthalpies coming out from our fits. Notably,
the denaturation curves are systematically steeper for the reduced
species, as compared to those of the oxidized forms. Such a behavior
relates to the transition enthalpies and is expectable from the following
facts. First, folding and denaturation of blue copper proteins are
intimately linked to the formation or disruption of the copper site.8,9,20 Second, the theoretical analyses
have shown that the interactions of Cu(II) with its coordination sphere
in blue copper proteins are more stabilizing than those involving
Cu(I).21

To assign separate contributions
of the protein matrix and the
copper center to the thermal stabilization of V48I Syn-Pc, we have compared the Tm values of
the apo and holo forms of the WT and mutant Pcs from Synechocystis (see Figure 2 and Table 1). The contribution of the protein matrix to protein
stability is reflected in the Tm value
of the apo-Pc, whereas the contribution of the copper center can be
assessed by the Tm difference between
the holo- and apoproteins. The Tm value
of apo V48I Syn-Pc shows an increase of 0.7 °C
compared to the value of apo Syn-Pc, which suggests
a small effect of the mutation on the stability of the protein matrix
itself. In fact, the Tm values for the
oxidized and reduced forms of holo V48I Syn-Pc are
3.9 and 1.8 °C higher than that for Syn-Pc.
Therefore, these results indicate that the thermal stability increase
of the V48I Syn-Pc mutant is mainly related to the
behavior of its copper center.

2.2 Redox
Thermodynamics of Immobilized Pc
On the basis of the above
findings, we have investigated the influence
of the remote east patch region on the redox function of Pcs. In particular,
we have assessed the temperature dependence of the interfacial electron
transfer of immobilized Pcs on a cysteamine-modified gold electrode.
To this end, the protein-modified electrode was subjected to a thermal
cycle that lasted ∼6 h, where the temperature was first increased
from 0 to 90 °C and then lowered back to 0 °C, while recording
the cyclic voltammograms every 10 °C. Figure 3a illustrates some typical cyclic voltammograms
recorded at 0 and 80 °C for the three Pcs. The thermodynamics
of Pc redox conversion was characterized by its formal potential,
which is determined as the midpoint potential (E1/2) of the anodic and cathodic voltammetric waves at low scan
rates. Figure 3b shows
the temperature dependence of the midpoint potentials for the three
Pcs. The temperature dependence of the E1/2 values was found to be different for Pho-Pc and Syn-Pc. At low temperatures, the E1/2 values for Pho-Pc are more positive than
for Syn-Pc, indicating a higher stabilization of
the reduced Pho-Pc. However, as the temperature raises
over 30 °C, the E1/2 values of Pho-Pc become more negative than those of Syn-Pc, suggesting a further stabilization of the oxidized form of Pho-Pc as the temperature is increased.

Figure 3 (a) Cyclic voltammograms
recorded at the indicated temperatures
and 0.05 V s–1 for immobilized Pcs. (b) E1/2 vs T plots and (c) E1/2/T vs 1/T plots for immobilized Pho-Pc (black circle), Syn-Pc (green square), and V48I Syn-Pc
(red triangle). Other experimental conditions: 0.1 M sodium phosphate
buffer, pH 7. The error bars indicate the standard deviation of at
least three replicated measurements for each data point.

The values of the redox thermodynamic parameters
ΔSrc0 and ΔHrc0, associated with
the electron exchange between
the protein and the electrode, were estimated from the slopes of the E1/2 versus T (Figure 3b) and the E1/2/T versus 1/T (Figure 3c) plots, respectively,
and are listed in Table 2. The E1/2 values for these proteins
are found to be modulated by both enthalpic and entropic contributions.
In particular, the redox thermodynamics of Pho-Pc
and Syn-Pc is characterized by the highly negative
ΔSrc0 and ΔHrc0 values, in agreement
with previous results reported for the other proteins of the same
family,20−23 revealing significant differences in the protein solvation and/or
structure upon changing its oxidation state. Thus, the larger absolute
ΔSrc0 and ΔHrc0 values of Pho-Pc, as compared to those of Syn-Pc,
would point to a higher flexibility of the protein matrix of Pho-Pc. Notably, the E1/2 values
of the V48I mutant are similar to those of the thermophilic protein
in the whole temperature range we have explored (Figure 3b). The thermodynamic analysis
of the E1/2 values shows that the E1/2 differences between the Syn-Pc mutant and its WT counterpart come from a competitive balance
between the enthalpic and entropic contributions (see Table 2). These results reveal that
the hydrophobic packing in the east patch region of Pc is crucial
to control the relative stability and function of the oxidized and
reduced forms of the protein.

Pcs

ΔHrc0 (kJ mol–1)	–54 ± 3	–54 ± 4	–47 ± 3	
Besides, the fact that the oxidized form of the V48I Syn-Pc mutant is more thermostable than the oxidized form
of Syn-Pc, combined with the fact that the E1/2 values of the V48I Syn-Pc
mutant
are negatively shifted, up to 20 mV at the highest temperature, suggests
the existence of a relationship between the redox function and protein
thermal stability.

2.3 MD of Pc
Bearing
in mind that the
thermostability and functionality of redox proteins are related to
their structural flexibility,24−28 we have analyzed the influence of the local hydrophobicity of the
east patch of these Pcs on their mobility and flexibility by MD. We
have performed a series of MD simulations at 298 K (see Figure 4).

Figure 4 MD computations of Syn-Pc
(green), V48I Syn-Pc
(red), and Pho-Pc (black). (A) Time courses for the
RMSD with respect to the energy-minimized structure and RG. (B) Comparison of the per-residue atomic fluctuations computed
as the root-mean-square (RMS) fluctuations with respect to the average
coordinates. The residue numbering takes into account two three-residue
insertions in the sequence of Pho-Pc, to make comparisons
easier. (C) Comparison of 3N × 3N covariance matrices for the coordinates of the Cα atoms of Syn-Pc (top) and V48I Syn-Pc (bottom). The negative values are in blue; positive in red. The
two plots have the same intensity scale.

The total simulated time was 50 ns in each run. This assures
a
sufficient conformation sampling, as we showed for Pho-Pc in the previous 10 ns computations.29 The structure of the three proteins hardly changed along the computations,
according to the behavior of the radius of gyration (RG) and the RMS deviations (RMSD) of the backbone atom coordinates
along the trajectories (Figure 4A). In fact, the RMSD between the average structure of the
trajectories and the coordinates in the PDB (Protein Data Bank) were
1.04 Å for Pho-Pc (pdb code: 1baw) and 1.2 Å
for Syn-Pc (pdb code: 1pcs), and the largest differences were located
at the mobile loops L1 and L5. The analysis of the per-residue fluctuations
carried out to test the flexibility of the different parts of the
protein showed similar patterns for the three Pcs (Figure 4B). Nevertheless, Syn-Pc showed slightly higher values than the two other proteins for
the three sequence stretches corresponding to the loops L1, L5, and
the C-terminal loop (CTL), which provides three of the ligands to
the metal. To test whether such minimal changes would have a functional
meaning, the covariance matrix of atomic coordinates for Syn-Pc and the V48I mutant was obtained (Figure 4C). Notably there are substantial differences
between the inter-residual covariances, suggesting a change in the
coupling of motions of flexible regions within the proteins. Then,
the quasi-harmonic analysis of the mass-weighted covariance of main
chain atoms allowed us to determine the concerted motions within the
three proteins. Figure 5 displays the RMS fluctuation ellipsoids for the first nontrivial
modes.

Figure 5 Thermal ellipsoids for the first internal motion modes of the main
chain atoms. The ellipsoid amplitudes are proportional to the atomic
fluctuations along the trajectory for each mode. The ellipsoid colors
follow the CPK scheme of the corresponding atoms. The arrows highlight
the differences in the coupling of the flexible site motions.

For Syn-Pc, this
“essential dynamics”
analysis shows a strong correlation of motions of the N-terminus with
loops 1 and C (black arrows in Figure 5). This coupling of motions involving the CTL is much
weaker for Pho-Pc and V48I Syn-Pc.
This is also consistent with our previous analysis by X-ray absorption
near-edge spectroscopy, showing a 0.15 Å increase in the Cu–SγCys bond length in the reduced Syn-Pc with
respect to that in Pho-Pc.16 Instead, both Pho-Pc and V48I Syn-Pc show an increased coupling between the motions of loop 1 and
the other regions of the protein far from the copper site, including
loop 5 in the east patch (green and orange arrows in Figure 5). These results strongly suggest
a relationship between the coupling of the internal motions of the
CTLs containing the copper ligands and the packing of the hydrophobic
residues located in the east patch of Pc.

Question arises about
the mechanisms underlying the coupling between
loops L1, L5, and CTL. Given the stiffness of the β barrel,
we were unable to find significant conformation changes in its internal
residues, separating loop L5 in one of the poles of the molecule from
loops L1 and CTL in the other. Most probably, the coupling mechanism
may involve long-range interactions such as electrostatics. Indeed,
the electrostatic fields around the three proteins differ, as shown
in the surface potentials in Figure 6A. Two residues, a glutamic residue (E84) and an arginine
one (R87; R93 in Pho-Pc) are located in the CTL.
E84 is absent in Pho-Pc, for which remote mutations
at L5 also impact the copper site, turning it into a Syn-Pc-like species.15,16 However, E84 is involved in the
network of salt bridges across the east side of the protein.11 R87 is highly conserved in Pcs, and a 30 mV
decrease in E0′ takes place upon the mutation of this
residue in Nostoc Pc.30 This residue points to the exposed region of the so-called east
patch and, in Syn-Pc species, forms a salt bridge
with E84.11Figure 6B illustrates how the V48I mutation decreases
the interplay among K59, E84, and R87, and, as a result, the fluctuations
in the side chain of R87 decrease. In Pho-Pc, R93
(R87 in Syn proteins) is restrained through its interaction
with D44 (the average distance between the polar heads is ca. 6 Å).
Moreover, Figure 6 also
shows an overall change in the behavior of the rest of the charged
residues, in particular those at the L5 loop, which may also influence
the behavior of R87. In agreement, the mutations in this region decrease
the redox potential measured in solution, depending on their impact
on the electrostatic potential.31

are colored according to the CPK profile. (C) Box diagrams corresponding
to the MD-derived statistics of the geometrical parameters associated
to the copper site properties at 25 °C, as described in the main
text.

The observed changes affect the
geometry of the first metal coordination
sphere and its environment. Figure 6C displays the average of three parameters related
to the stability and other properties of the oxidized copper site.21,32 Cu(I) tends to form a trigonal planar geometry, whereas Cu(II) tends
to form tetrahedral coordinates.21 Thus,
the height of Cu above the equatorial plane relates to the stability
of the oxidized species. The other two parameters, the angle Φ
between the N–Cu–N and S–Cu–S planes and
the angle α between the N–Cu–N plane and the Cu–SγCys bond, relate to the overlap between the metal and ligand
orbitals, again affecting the stability of the active site. Notably,
we found small but significant differences (all p values in the Student t test below 10–19) among the three proteins in these geometric parameters, V48I Syn-Pc displaying a value between those of WT Syn-Pc and Pho-Pc. Notably, according to these data,
the oxidized form at 25 °C is less stable in the last one, in
agreement with the slightly higher redox potential observed experimentally.

3 Conclusions
The comparison of the thermal
and functional behaviors of a thermophilic
Pc from Phormidium laminosum with that
of its mesophilic counterpart from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, in a wide temperature range (0–90
°C), reveals a marked difference in their redox properties and
thermal stability. A single point mutation, trying to replicate the
local hydrophobicity of the thermophilic variant in the east patch,
modifies significantly the melting point and redox parameter values,
which become close to those of the thermophilic protein. Moreover,
MD computations reveal similarities in the coupling of flexible site
motions of Pho-Pc and V48I Syn-Pc
that are not present in WT Syn-Pc, indicating that
the observed behaviors correlate with the degree of coupling of the
CTL motions to those of the remote hotspots of the protein. Such differences
seem to originate from the changes in the coupling interactions between
the ionizable side chains. These findings showcase the existence of
a relationship between the structural properties of the hydrophobic
cluster, located in the east patch region of Pc, and dynamic coupling
of the flexible site motions and the relative stability and function
of the oxidized and reduced forms of the protein.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Protein Production
The expression
of the petE genes from Synechocystis sp. and P. laminosum—using
pBluescript II SK+ constructs already published—followed the
procedures previously described.6,7 Site-directed mutagenesis
was performed with the “quick change” method (Stratagen
Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). The WT and V48I Syn-Pc
proteins were produced in Escherichia coli DH5α strains, whereas the expression of the Pho-Pc coding gene took place in the electroporated K12 cells. As described
previously, the proteins were purified by ion-exchange chromatography
across a diethyl-aminoethyl cellulose column, using a 5 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane
(Tris)/HCl buffer and a 10–180 mM NaCl concentration gradient.
The WT and V48I Syn-Pc species were further purified
by chromatofocusing in a Polybuffer Exchanger 94 (Sigma-Aldrich) column
equilibrated in 5 mM Tris/acetate, pH 7.0, and a subsequent size exclusion
step in Sephadex G50. In its turn, Pho-Pc purification
required an additional size exclusion chromatography step in a HiLoad
16/60 Sephadex 75 (Pharmacia) column equilibrated in 100 mM NaCl and
10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The protein concentrations
and purity were determined by measuring the light absorption at 280
nm (protein) and 597 nm (oxidized blue copper site), using a 4500
M–1 cm–1 extinction coefficient
for the copper site at 597 nm.

4.2 Variable-Temperature
Cyclic Voltammetry
Polycrystalline gold disk electrodes had
a geometric area of 0.0314
cm2. Prior to measurements, the gold surface was cleaned
by successively polishing with 0.3 and 0.05 μm alumina and rinsed
with Millipore water, and then it was sonicated in absolute ethanol
to remove the residual alumina. The surface was then dried with argon
and chemically cleaned using a “piranha” solution (7:3
mixture of concentrated H2SO4 and 30% H2O2). The cysteamine self-assembled monolayers were
prepared by immersing the gold electrode in a 1 mM cysteamine solution
in ethanol for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein immobilization was carried
out by depositing onto the thiol-modified electrode surface of a 10
μL drop 100 μM protein Pc, 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer
solution of pH 7 for 16 h at room temperature. Then, the electrodes
were thoroughly rinsed with water and washed with the working buffer
solution.

Linear scan voltammetric measurements were performed
with an Autolab PGSTAT 30 from Eco Chemie B.V., in a three-electrode
undivided glass cell, equipped with a gas inlet and thermostated with
a water jacket. The counter and reference electrodes were a Pt bar
and an Ag/AgCl/NaCl saturated electrode, respectively. The reference
electrode was connected to the cell solution via a salt bridge and
kept at room temperature (23 ± 2 °C) in a nonisothermal
configuration. The reported potential values have been corrected to
the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) potential scale by adding +192
mV to the experimental potential values. All measurements were carried
out under argon atmosphere. The working solutions contained 0.1 M
sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.0. To assess the influence of temperature
on the midpoint potential, the electrode with the adsorbed protein
was kept inside the electrochemical cell for ∼6 h, while the
temperature was first increased from 0 to 90 °C, and then lowered
back to 0 °C, with stops to record the voltammograms at different
potential scan rates (from 0.01 to 0.1 V s–1), every
10 °C.

4.3 Fluorescence Spectroscopy
The thermal
titration curves derived from the fluorescence measurements were obtained
according to the protocol described previously.6 The measurements were performed with a Cary (Varian) fluorimeter
coupled to a Polystat cc2 (Huber) bath for temperature control. The
temperature of the sample was recorded using a Digitron 2008 system
equipped with a flexible thermocouple that was inserted inside the
cuvette and in contact with the sample. The protein concentration
was 20 μM in a 10 mM pH 7 phosphate buffer solution. To maintain
the protein in a single redox state throughout the experiment, equimolar
concentrations of sodium ascorbate or potassium ferricyanide were
added. The temperature in the cuvette was programmed to increase at
a rate of 1 °C min–1, from 20 to 95 °C.
The sample was subjected to continuous stirring throughout the process
to achieve temperature homogenization. The samples were excited with
275 nm light, and the fluorescence emission was monitored at 350 nm.
As a control before and after each temperature ramp, an emission spectrum
from 300 to 600 nm was recorded, whereas the sample was being excited
with a 275 nm ultraviolet light. The fluorescence and temperature
data were recorded every 30 s and exported to the Origin Version 8.0
program for analysis.

4.4 CD Spectroscopy
To monitor the changes
in the secondary structure during unfolding, the CD spectra were recorded
in the far ultraviolet region (190–240 nm) with a Jasco J-815
spectropolarimeter, while increasing the temperature from 25 to 95
°C at a rate of 1 °C min–1 with a Peltier
unit. Three spectra were recorded every 5 °C, with a scanning
speed of 200 nm min–1. The samples contained 15
μM protein in a 10 mM pH 7 phosphate buffer solution. The unfolding
curves were obtained from the CD values recorded at 219 nm.

4.5 Computational Analysis
The MD trajectories
were computed with the Amber 16 package,33 using the 14SB force field,34 except
for the copper site for which the parameters set by Comba and Remenyi35 and the restrained electrostatic potential charges
computed by Muñoz-López6 were
applied. The simulations were run under periodic boundary conditions
in orthorhombic boxes, wherein the initial minimum distance from the
protein to cell faces was 10 Å. The particle mesh Ewald electrostatics
was set with the Ewald summation cutoff at 9 Å. The counterions
neutralized the charges of the system. The structures were solvated
with SPC water molecules.36 The protein
side chains were energy-minimized (100 steepest descent and 1400 conjugate
gradient steps) down to an RMS energy gradient of 0.01 kJ mol–1 Å–1. Afterward, the solvent
was subjected to 1000 steps of steepest descent minimization, followed
by 500 ps NPT-MD computations using isotropic molecule
position scaling and a pressure relaxation time of 2 ps at 298 K.
The temperature was regulated with Berendsen’s heat bath algorithm,31 with a coupling time constant equal to 0.5 ps.
The density of the system reached a plateau after ca. 150 ps simulation.
Then, for each protein, the whole system was energy-minimized and
submitted to NVT-MD at 298 K, using 2.0 fs integration
time steps. The SHAKE algorithm37 was used
to constrain the bonds involving hydrogen atoms. The coordinate files
were processed using CPPTRAJ.38 Further
processing was made in Origin 16 (Originlab), and the graphic displays
were built in UCSF Chimera.39 The electrostatic
potentials were computed with the APBS software.40
