A general
approach to C3 modification of purine scaffold through
various types of cross-coupling reactions has been established. Tuning
substrate electronics and reaction conditions resulted in the development
of highly efficient sp2–sp, sp2–sp2, and sp2–sp3 cross-coupling
conditions for modification of 3-deazaadenine to access C3-modified
adenine and hypoxanthine scaffolds. The optimized methodologies to
access the corresponding 3-deazaadenosine phosphoramidites for solid-phase
DNA synthesis have been demonstrated.

Introduction
Purines are important
building blocks used effectively across various
disciplines. Functionalization and modification of purines have been
of interest for synthetic organic chemistry, medicinal chemistry,
and toxicology as reflected by the half-century application and development
of purine-based anticancer or antiviral agents.1−4 Purines are also of interest as
detection probes5−9 and as mechanistic probes for understanding cellular responses to
DNA and RNA modification.10,11 Approaching these highly
functionalized heterocycles often requires tuning of existing or development
of new synthetic routes. Overcoming challenges associated with the
reactivity of 3-deazaadenine derivatives, in particular, has been
approached through de novo construction of 3-deaza-3-substituted purine
backbone or functionalization of nucleosides. Several modifications,
such as 3-methyl, the related protected 3-hydroxymethyl, and methylenethiol
or nitro groups were reported.12−15 3-Deaza-3-fluoroadenosines had to be synthesized
stepwise, but other 3-halo derivatives could also be obtained through
direct halogenation of the nonsubstituted 3-deazaadenosines.16−22 The use of cross-coupling reactions in C3 modification of purines
is, however, limited. Examples of palladium-catalyzed methylations
of 3-deaza-3-bromoadenosine analogues through Kumada coupling have
been demonstrated.17,20 Recently, the modification of
adenosine nucleosides through Sonogashira cross-coupling has been
reported, providing access to 3-deaza-3-alkyne adenosine derivatives.8,9,23 However, the use of nucleosides
as substrates for cross-coupling reactions can be challenging due
to the presence of potentially labile glycosidic bonds or nucleophilic
functional groups that have to be protected to achieve the compatibility
with many organometallic reagents, as reflected by the reported examples
of Negishi and Kumada reactions for the introduction of alkyl or benzyl
substituents.24−27 Given the importance of modified nucleobases itself, the method
that would allow a direct access to C-3 modified purine scaffolds
would be therefore of interest. Here, we describe a general strategy
that allows the deliberate synthesis of various 3-deaza-3-substituted
purine analogues through metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions.

Results
and Discussion
En route to 3-deazaadenine analogues of purines,
we first investigated
the reactivity of the readily available 3-deazaadenine 1 (Scheme 1) in cross-coupling
reactions.15 In direct attempts to utilize
it as a cross-coupling partner, we were able to obtain the 3-iodo-3-deazaadenine 2 and observe its acceptable reactivity under Suzuki cross-coupling
conditions using the Pd(OAc)2/3,3′,3″-phosphanetriyltris(benzenesulfonic
acid) trisodium salt (TPPTS) catalyst system, a general method developed
for aqueous coupling reactions of halogenated purine/pyrimidine nucleobases
and nucleosides.4,26,28 The reactions of 2 with phenylboronic acid and trans-2-phenylvinylboronic acid afforded compounds 3a and 3b with 65 and 58% yield, respectively
(Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Synthesis
of Compounds 1–4
Despite the sufficient results obtained for Suzuki cross-coupling
of 2 with model aryl/vinylboronic acids, this condition
failed in the attempt to produce an alkyl analogue with model ethylboronic
acid, similarly as reported by other authors.26 The reactivity of 2 can be hampered by its low solubility
in organic solvents and the presence of active nucleophilic nitrogens.
When the amino group at C6 was protected as an isobutyryl amide (the
established purine protecting group), the more soluble N-(7-bromo-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]pyridin-4-yl)isobutyramide 4 was obtained (Scheme 1).15 Various Suzuki coupling conditions
of 4 with phenyl- and isobutylboronic acids were investigated,
involving metal catalysts, such as Pd(PPh3)4, Pd2(dba)3, PddppfCl2, and NiCl2(dme); ligands, such as PCy3, (t-Bu)2PMeHBF4, and SPhos; and bases, such as
K2CO3, Cs2CO3, K3PO4, and KOt-Bu in ethereal or alcoholic
solvents.29−33 Typically, the unreacted starting material was recovered from the
reaction mixtures, highlighting the lack of reactivity of 4. Also, the liability of amide protecting group prohibited the use
of aqueous coupling conditions utilizing bases such as carbonates.

We have also evaluated the possibility of using a commercial C6-chloro
(5) and the known C6-azide34 (5b) purines as starting materials amenable for further
amination and reduction, respectively, to access 3-deazaadenine. However,
attempts to install a halide at C3 (compound 6, Scheme 1) have failed, precluding
further evaluation.

As the electron-withdrawing groups at C6
(chloride, amide, or azide)
were shutting off the reactivity of C3 position, we hypothesized that
the use of electronically more neutral protecting groups will promote
the solubility of 1 and retain its reactivity toward
cross-coupling reactions. Unfavorably, the direct attempts to react 5 with bisbenzylamines to produce the desired cross-coupling
partner of type 13 (Scheme 2) failed even under harsh conditions (e.g.,
140 °C, neat or dimethylformamide (DMF)/K2CO3), reflecting the evident low reactivity of this substrate toward
direct displacement of chlorine atom.12,34 We decided
to investigate the catalytic aminations with bis(4-methoxybenzylamine)
((PMB)2NH) on 5. In parallel, the catalytic
amination of PMB-protected analogue was investigated, considering
the reported challenges for modifications of unprotected imidazoles.35 It should be noted that PMB protection of 5 (PMBCl, K2CO3, N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA), 45 °C, 24 h, 96% yield)
yielded a ∼1.6:1 mixture of N9- and N7-PMB-protected products
that was used directly.36 Several literature
conditions applicable for chloroarenes, 6-halopurines, and their nucleosides
were investigated.37−42 RuPhos and its Pd-bound precatalyst in the presence of NaOt-Bu in tetrahydrofuran (THF)41 have been shown to be particularly successful for the reactions
of nonactivated heretoaryl chlorides with secondary amines. Under
these conditions, up to 19% of N9-PMB-protected product (identical
to 13-H, Experimental Section) was obtained, albeit with higher catalyst loading (6 mol %) and
prolonged reaction time (43 h). However, a significant decomposition
was observed. The use of LiHMDS instead of NaOt-Bu
led to the exclusive decomposition of both protected and nonprotected 5. Next, Pd(OAc)2 was tested in combination with
ligands, such as BINAP, SPhos, and XPhos, in the presence of Cs2CO3 or NaOt-Bu in solvents, such
as toluene, THF, dioxane, and DMF.37−40,42 Significant decomposition was observed in the majority of cases,
but no product formation. Some level of success was achieved with
the combination of Pd(OAc)2 (0.1 equiv) and SPhos (0.2
equiv) in the presence of NaOt-Bu in toluene (110
°C, 22 h). 13-H was isolated in 21% yield, reflecting
the low reactivity of heteroaryl chlorides with secondary amines.40,41 For practical purposes, we have not investigated this reaction further.

Scheme 2 Synthesis of Compound 13
To overcome hurdles posed by the limited reactivity of
the tested
substrates, we decided to construct the fully protected 3-deazaadenine
analogue from the cheap, available precursors, using a similar route
as reported in the literature.15,43 The highly regioselective
sequential substitutions of 4- and 2-chloro atoms of the known derivative 9(43) with 4-methoxybenzylamine (PMBNH2) followed by (PMB)2NH produced compound 11 (Experimental Section), and upon
further reduction of the nitro group and cyclization, we were able
to obtain the target 3-deazaadenine precursor (13) with
the exclusive N9-PMB protection and 26% overall yield in six steps
from a commercial 3-nitropyridine-2,4-diol 7 (Scheme 2). The length of
the synthetic route is similar to that of 1(15) but offers access to the fully protected soluble
starting material amenable to functionalization.

Gratifyingly,
a variety of different coupling conditions involving 13 were successfully demonstrated, as shown in Table 1, including the examples of
reactions such as Suzuki43,44 (entries 1–5),
Heck45 (entries 6 and 7), Sonogashira8,23 (entry 8), Kumada46 (entries 9 and 10),
Negishi (entries 11–14),47 and the
nickel-catalyzed reductive couplings of alkyl halides recently developed
by the Weix group (entry 15).48

b Yield isolated after treatment of
the crude mixture with N-iodosuccinimide (NIS) and
separation of 13-I (for details, see Experimental Section).

c Contains ∼20% of n-propyl impurity.

The Suzuki couplings could be accomplished
with aromatic, alkenyl,
and alkyl boronic acids (entries 1–5). Both electron-rich and
electron-deficient alkenes were tolerated under the Heck conditions
(entries 6 and 7). Sonogashira coupling with phenylacetylene proceeded
with high efficiency (89%, entry 8).

The formation of alkyl
derivatives, with the challenging substrates
containing β-hydrogens, such as alkylboronic acids or ethyl
4-bromobutyrate, was less efficient (29–35%, entries 3–5
and 15) and accompanied by a significant hydrodebromination reaction,
indicating the extent of the undesired β-H elimination. This
byproduct (13-H) could be subjected to halogenation,
for example, by the treatment of crude reaction mixtures with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS)/NIS, facilitating a chromatographic
separation of the cross-coupled product 14, while the
haloderivative 13/13-I could be recovered (see Experimental Section). The iodo analogue 13-I obtained this way offered no selectivity enhancement for alkylations
using conditions B or F. Propitiously, simple alkyl derivatives could
be obtained with improved yields (45–87%) through Kumada-type
couplings with substrates such as trimethylaluminum and benzylmagnesium
chloride (entries 9 and 10). Ultimately, modified Negishi conditions
allowed the access to a variety of primary alkyl derivatives with
notably higher yields than those obtained through Suzuki protocol
(entries 11–13 vs 3–5). In the case of challenging isopropyl
derivative, we observed up to 20% of the known isopropyl to n-propyl isomerization (entry 14).49 Interestingly, our Negishi protocol provided satisfying and consistent
results only when an excess of Grignard reagent against an overstoichiometric
amount of zinc chloride was used, which helped to improve the solubility
of the intermediate organozinc species. This observation seems to
be in accord with the works by the Organ group that unveiled the mechanisms
involving organozinc reagents in Negishi cross-couplings.50,51

Clearly, the fully protected nucleobase 13 allows
the use of a broad scope of coupling conditions with not only the
formation of saturated and unsaturated C–C bonds, but also
the introduction of functional groups, to access the C3-modified 3-deazaadenine
derivatives. These results pinpoint appropriateness of the PMB as
a protecting group with suitable electronic and chemical properties
that allowed to achieve the desired reactivity of 13 among
the other tested 3-deaza-3-haloadenine substrates.

We further
aimed to elaborate the products to the protected phosphoramidites
to verify their compatibility with producing building blocks for solid-phase
DNA synthesis. The route to phosphoramidites is exemplified by the
synthesis of compound 20i (Scheme 3). We successfully optimized the procedure
for complete deprotection of benzyl derivative 14i affording
modified purine 15i.52 The
known problem of selectivity for purine glycosylations prompted us
to use the tetramethylsuccinimide directing/protecting group, developed
by the McLaughlin group,53 to increase
the selectivity toward the desired N9 β-glycosylation. The crude
salt 15i was converted accordingly to the corresponding
imide 16i through the reported two-step procedure using
tetramethylsuccinic anhydride (Me4SA).53 The imide 16i was subjected to glycosylation
with 1-(α)-chloro-3,5-di-O-(p-toluoyl)-2-deoxy-d-ribose, affording the desired N9 β-nucleoside 17i in 39% yield. The configuration of nucleoside 17i was unambiguously confirmed by the nuclear Overhauser enhancement
spectroscopy (NOESY) experiment (Figure S1, Supporting Information). It was then elaborated to the corresponding
phosphoramidite 20i through standard methods (Scheme 3). Analogously, two
other phosphoramidites 20d and 20e were
prepared from 14d and 14e, ethyl and isobutyl
analogues, respectively. All three phosphoramidites were successfully
used in solid-phase DNA synthesis, and further studies are in progress.
Interestingly, the preparation of the corresponding phosphoramidite 20a from phenyl derivative 14a could not be achieved
due to the destabilizing effect of the Ph group on the glycosidic
bond (see Experimental Section). We have also
considered the possibility of the direct functionalization of nucleosides
by an attempt to prepare a bromo analogue of 17i through
the halogenation of the reported nonmodified 3-deazaadenine phosphoramidite.13 However, the reactions with NBS in CH2Cl2 or DMF were unsuccessful, likely due to the electronegative
effect of the tetramethylsuccinimide group.

Scheme 3 Synthesis of Phosphoramidite 20i
Additionally, the
modified 3-deazaadenines could be readily converted
to the corresponding 3-deazahypoxanthines, purine analogues of interest
for medicinal chemistry,36,54 upon treatment with
NaNO2 as exemplified by the reaction of crude salt 15c to produce 21c in 57% yield based on 14c (Scheme 4).55,56 This transformation further demonstrates
the potential of our synthetic approach toward C3-modified purine
scaffold.

Scheme 4 Synthesis of 3-Deazahypoxanthine 21c
Conclusions
This
study illustrates the merit of a new fully protected 3-bromo-3-deazaadenine
derivative developed by us as a building block for the deliberate
synthesis of 3-substituted 3-deazaadenine and adenosine derivatives
through metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions and selective N9
β-glycosylations. It should be expected that both modified purines
and their nucleosides will be of interest for applications related
to chemical biology, DNA studies, and medicinal chemistry.

with a small volume of ice-cold water several times and then with
ethanol (3 × 15 mL), and dried in air. 8 was obtained

for 24 h under argon, an excess
pressure being released for several times within the first few hours.
Then, POCl3 was carefully distilled off under vacuum. The
oily residue was diluted with Et2O (100 mL), cooled on
an ice bath, and crushed ice (200 mL) was carefully added (exothermic
reaction). The phases were separated, aqueous phase was additionally
extracted with Et2O (2 × 50 mL), and the combined

(19e)
This compound was synthesized in a similar
fashion to 19i. To a solution of 18e (225
mg, 0.507 mmol) in dry pyridine (4 mL), 4,4′-dimethoxytrityl
chloride (DMT-Cl) (240 mg, 0.709 mmol) was added in one portion, and
the mixture was stirred at room temperature under argon for 4 h. TLC
analysis indicated that a lot of starting material remained and then
additional DMT-Cl (0.120 g, 0.355 mmol) and cat. 4-dimethylaminopyridine
(DMAP) (10 mg) were added. After 14 h, more DMT-Cl (0.120 g, 0.350
mmol), triethylamine (85 μL, 0.608 mmol), and cat. DMAP (10
mg) were added. After 8 h, another portion as above was added, and
after 16 h, TLC showed no further conversion (overall 42 h). The mixture
was quenched with 200 μL of MeOH, concentrated in vacuo, the
residue was taken in AcOEt and filtered, and the filtrate was concentrated
in vacuo. The product was purified by column chromatography on silica
gel (neutralized with triethylamine) eluting with 0–25% acetone
in dichloromethane to obtain 19e as a colorless foam
in 46% yield (175 mg). Further elution with 10% MeOH in dichloromethane
yielded the recovered starting material 18e as a colorless
syrup in 45% yield (102 mg). HRMS (ESI): m/z [M + H]+ calcd for C44H51N4O7: 747.37582; found: 747.37412. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ, 8.17 (s, 1H), 8.14 (s,

(2-Cyanoethyl) Diisopropylphosphoramidite (20e)
This compound was synthesized in a similar fashion to 20i. To a solution of 19e (105 mg, 0.146 mmol) in dry CH2Cl2 (5 mL) containing N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIEA) (185 μL, 1.07 mmol),
2-cyanoethyl-N,N-diisopropyl chlorophosphoramidite
(105 μL, 0.472 mmol) was added in one portion, and the mixture
was stirred at room temperature under argon for 4 h (TLC showed complete
conversion). The mixture was concentrated in vacuo at rt, and the
product was purified by column chromatography on silica gel (neutralized
with triethylamine) eluting with 40–60% EtOAc in hexanes containing
1% triethylamine, to obtain 20e as a mixture of diastereomers
(white foam, Rf ∼0.5 in 50% EtOAc
in hexanes, two close spots visible on TLC) in 59% yield (120 mg).

The attempted tritylation
of 18a was carried forward in a similar fashion to 18i. To a solution of 18a (0.15 g, 0.323 mmol)
in pyridine (3 mL) under Ar, 4,4′-dimethoxytrityl chloride
(DMT-Cl) (0.153 g, 0.453 mmol) was added in one portion, and the mixture
was stirred at room temperature for 4.5 h. TLC analysis indicated
that some starting material remained and then additional DMT-Cl was
added (0.076 g, 0.225 mmol). After 3.5 h, the starting material still
remained and then triethylamine (45 μL, 0.323 mmol), cat. DMAP
(10 mg), and additional DMT-Cl (44 mg, 0.129 mmol) were added. After
8 h, most of the starting material was consumed, the mixture was concentrated
in vacuo, and the residue was coevaporated with toluene (3 ×
10 mL) to remove residual pyridine. A TLC analysis indicated that
an extensive deglycosylation occurred, indicating the instability
of the compound, which may be ascribed to the electronic character
of phenyl group at the position 3, as suggested by other reports.15 Deglycosylation was also observed to occur upon
mild heating of the TLC plate to remove pyridine before analysis.

TFA salts 15 were used
for synthetic purposes typically without further
purification. Pure amines could be also isolated as water-soluble
HCl salts as exemplified below. Free amines could be obtained by neutralization
of their aqueous solutions with Na2CO3, followed
by extraction with AcOEt.

7-Phenethyl-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]pyridin-4-amine, Hydrochloric Acid Salt (15c*HCl)
A solution of 14c (0.173 g, 0.29 mmol)
in EtOH/H2O/HCl conc. (8/8/4 mL) was heated under reflux
condenser at
100 °C for 23 h. It was cooled, and EtOH was removed under reduced
pressure. It was diluted with aq HCl and washed with Et2O (40 mL, discarded) to remove a precipitated oil. The residue was
concentrated and dried under vacuum to obtain 15c*HCl (ca. 0.08 g, quantitative) as an off-white solid. HRMS (ESI): m/z [M + H]+ calcd for C14H15N4: 239.12968; found: 239.12930.
