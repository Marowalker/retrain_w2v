The electronic and
magnetic properties of oxygen- and sulfur-passivated
one-dimensional armchair GaN nanoribbons (A-GaNNRs) are revealed using
both first-principles density-functional theory and ab initio molecular
dynamics simulations. We explore that an applied external electric
field can further modulate the electronic properties of both pristine
and passivated A-GaNNRs, thus changing their properties (semiconducting–metallic–half-metallic).
A-GaNNRs of 0.9–3.1 nm width are subjected to further investigations,
which reveal that sulfur termination transforms pristine A-GaNNRs
from direct into indirect band gap semiconductors, without affecting
their nonmagnetic nature. On the other hand, oxygen passivation introduces
spin-polarized behavior with a finite magnetic moment. Magnetism characteristics
in both bare and sulfur-passivated A-GaNNRs are induced by applying
a critical electric field along the direction of NR width. The passivated
A-GaNNRs are more stable compared to bare ones, while sulfur-passivated
A-GaNNRs exhibit higher stability at higher temperatures (>500
°C).
Thus, our results suggest that A-GaNNRs can be used in a broad range
of electronic, optoelectronic, and spintronic applications.

Introduction
The discovery of graphene1 and its unique
properties2−4 prompted extensive research into two-dimensional
(2D) materials, as they possess distinct physical characteristics
compared with their three-dimensional (3D) counterparts. 2D monolayers
(MLs) such as transition-metal dichalcogenides, phosphorene, borophene,
silicene, and Mxenes have been synthesized successfully.5−10 On the other hand, one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures garnered
significant attention from researchers due to their potential optoelectronic,
photochemical, and electro-transport properties caused by quantum
confinement and reduced dimensionality.11−16 Particularly, 1D nanoribbons (NRs) generated from 2D materials display
intriguing electronic properties based on their width and edge configurations
and are, thus, considered to be potential building blocks for the
next generation of electronic devices.17−22 Based on the crystal orientation, NRs are typically explored in
armchair or zigzag edge configurations.23

It is well known that III-nitrides are wide-band-gap semiconductors
and have the potential for use in optoelectronic and high-power applications,
such as lasers, light-emitting diodes, and detectors, as well as devices
operating in harsh environments.24−28 Recent developments have shown that 3D GaN can form
a hexagonal 2D graphene-like structure with sp2 hybridization
with an indirect band gap structure.29,30 Buckled 2D
GaN has been synthesized using a graphene-encapsulation technique.31 Single-crystalline 1D GaNNRs (GaNNRs), which
have thicknesses of a few nanometers, have been synthesized successfully
by flowing ammonia on Ga2O3 thin films.32 Some recent theoretical investigations pertaining
to bare-edge and hydrogen-passivated armchair GaNNRs (A-GaNNRs) suggested
that both NRs are nonmagnetic (NM) direct band gap semiconductors,
whereas bare-edge zigzag GaNNRs (z-GaNNRs) are metals irrespective
of their width.33 Chemical functionalization
of z-GaNNR edges with hydrogen and fluorine transforms them into semiconducting
and half-metallic materials, respectively.34 Moreover, investigations into doping effects have shown that a carbon
dopant is preferentially substituted at edge Ga or N sites in A-GaNNRs
and z-GaNNRs, respectively.35 However,
most extant studies in this domain have focused on z-GaNNRs, while
reports on the properties of A-GaNNRs are scarce. Furthermore, the
effect of electric field on bare and chemically functionalized A-GaNNRs
by different atoms (other than hydrogen or fluorine), as well as their
thermal stability, has never been investigated, even though this is
crucial for producing novel functional devices. Thus, there is still
a need for exploring potential optical, electronic, and magnetic characteristics
of A-GaNNR-based devices.

In this study, we address the aforementioned
gaps in pertinent
research by exploring the electronic and magnetic properties of A-GaNNRs
by adopting for the first time edge oxidization and sulfurization,
as well as applying an external field along the direction of the ribbon
width. Our findings indicate that edge oxidization transforms the
A-GaNNRs into magnetic semiconductors with a finite magnetic moment
(MM), whereas sulfur passivation transforms them from direct into
indirect band gap semiconductors. Moreover, application of an external
electric field modulates the electronic structure of both bare and
passivated A-GaNNRs. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations (AIMD)
reveal their structure stability at different temperatures.

Computational
Details
All first-principles calculations reported in this
work were performed
using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package36,37 based on density-functional theory (DFT). The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
(PBE)38 functional coupled with the generalized
gradient approximation was used for the exchange–correlation
potentials. The electron–ion interaction was described using
the projector-augmented wave method with a plane wave cutoff energy
of 500 eV. All atoms comprising the unit cell or supercell were relaxed
until the force on each atom decreased below 0.01 eV/Å. The energy
tolerance between two consecutive electronic relaxation steps was
considered to be 10–6 eV. A Monkhorst k-point scheme with 9 × 1 × 1 and 25 × 1 × 1 meshes
was used for the structural relaxation and electronic structure calculations,
respectively. The NRs were presented in the xy-plane
with infinite periodicity in the x-direction. A vacuum
layer of >12 Å thickness was considered in the y- and z-directions to avoid interactions between
adjacent cells. The following annotation was adopted for the nanoribbon
models: Na-X-A-GaNNR, where Na denotes the NR width (along the y-direction)
and X indicates the passivating atom. In this study, we investigated the widths in the
6 < Na < 20 range, corresponding
to the NR widths (along the y-direction) ranging
from 0.9 to 3.1 nm for all A-GaNNRs. The crystal structures of the
NRs and charge density plots were obtained using the VESTA software
package.39 The atomic positions were also
relaxed in the presence of an external electric field, and a sawtooth-like
potential was used. To examine the temperature effects on NR stability,
we carried out AIMD simulations using 8 × 1 × 1 supercells
(112 and 144 atoms for bare and O/S-A-GaNNRs, respectively), which
were modeled based on the initial unit cell geometry configurations.
The Nosé–Hoover thermostat40 scheme was adopted for temperature control. The simulation time
was set to 5 ps with a step size of 0.5 fs.

Results and Discussion
Atomic
Structure and Zero Electric Field Band Structure of Bare
A-GaNNRs
Before presenting the results obtained through A-GaNNR
investigations, it is worth noting that our calculations of the structural
and electronic properties of a 2D GaN monolayer (ML) yields a Ga–N
bond length of 1.86 Å, a lattice constant of 3.25 Å, and
a band gap of 1.94 eV, in line with previously reported findings.29,41 An A-GaNNR model is constructed by cutting such a GaN ML in a particular
direction. We explore the electronic properties of bare A-GaNNRs in
the absence of an external electric field, which are used for comparison,
as will be discussed later. Moreover, these results also help benchmark
the methodology adopted here against previously reported findings
related to bare A-GaNNRs of certain widths.

The atomic structure
of a bare A-GaNNR is presented in Figure 1a, in which two edge Ga (N) atoms are labeled
Ga1 (N1) and Ga2 (N2).
Here, we present the results related to bare NRs (not doped, not passivated)
of Na = 7 (7-A-GaNNR) as an example, as
we found that the NRs of different widths possess similar band structures
and electronic properties (NR properties as a function of width will
be discussed later). After structural relaxation, the optimized bond
lengths of Ga–N at the NR edges and in the inner region of
the NR are 1.77 and 1.86 Å, respectively. While the former value
is 0.09 Å smaller than that observed in the 2D GaN ML, the latter
one is identical to that of the 2D ML.29 The short Ga–N bond length at the NR edges can be attributed
to edge reconstruction, as the quantum dimension changes due to differences
in applied strain or unpassivated dangling bonds.33 A similar feature has been observed in bare NRs obtained
from other materials.18

Figure 1 (a) Geometric structure,
(b) band structure, and (c) projected
and total density of states (DOS) of pristine 7-A-GaNNR. Γ(0,0,0)
and X(0.5,0,0) are highly symmetrical Brillouin zone points. The partial
charge densities of VB1 and CB1 of 7-A-GaNNR are presented in the
right panel of (b). The dashed magenta line denotes the Fermi level
(EF).

The calculated band structure of 7-A-GaNNR is presented in Figure 1b, indicating that
the NR is a semiconductor with a direct band gap (Eg = 1.64 eV). The valence band maximum (VBM) and the conduction
band minimum (CBM) coincide at the highly symmetrical first Brillouin
zone point Γ. The obtained band gap value is in good agreement
with that previously reported for 7-A-GaNNR (1.8 eV) based on the
DFT-LDA approach.33 The small difference
between our PBE calculation and that obtained in the aforementioned
study is attributed to the use of different exchange–correlation
functionals. To determine the atomic contributions of the entire top
valence band (VB1) and the entire bottom conduction band (CB1) of
the NR in the first Brillouin zone, band-decomposed charge densities
are presented in the right panel of Figure 1b. It can be seen that the VB1 is formed
by dominant contribution of edge N atoms, whereas the interior N atoms
provide limited contribution, as shown in the bottom right panel of Figure 1b. This is expected,
as the dangling bonds attached to the edge N atoms trap free carriers
due to missing atoms. The orbital projected density of states (PDOS)
is shown in Figure 1c, which confirms that the VBM comes from the p-orbitals of the N
atoms due to the higher electronegativity of N, attracting the shared
bonded electrons more easily than Ga.42 Moreover, the N-p state has a lower energy than that of Ga, resulting
in major contribution to the bonding states of the VBM. On the other
hand, states pertaining to edge Ga and all N atoms within the NR contribute
to CB1, as shown in the top right panel of Figure 1b. Particularly, the CBM comes from the s-orbitals
of Ga atoms and s- and p-orbitals of N atoms (as shown in Figure 1c). Thus, this electronic
structure allows the electronic and magnetic properties of the NRs
to be explored when the edges are functionalized by chemical elements
and under the influence of an external electric field.

Band Structures
of Bare A-GaNNRs under an External Electric
Field
In this section, we discuss the effects of an externally
applied electric field (E⃗ext),
ranging from 0.1 to 1 V/Å, on the band structures of bare A-GaNNRs.
For consistency with the previous discussion, the reported results
pertain to NRs with Na = 7. In these calculations,
the electric field is applied along the direction of NR width, i.e., y-direction of the unit cell, which is perpendicular to
the NR growth direction, as shown in Figure 1a. Our findings reveal that no significant
effect on the NR is obtained by applying the field along the z-direction, as the carrier (both electrons and holes) wavefunctions
are restricted in the xy-plane in 2D materials. This
result is in line with the findings previously reported for armchair
and zigzag MoS2 NRs.14,19 Moreover, a positive
electric field direction is assumed from the edge Ga2 and
N2 to the edge Ga1 and N1.

Figure 2a and Figure 2b present the band
structures of A-GaNNRs under electric field strengths of 0.2 and 0.6
V/Å, respectively. When a weaker external electric field is applied,
the NR band gap decreases compared to that under the zero electric
field, as shown in Figure 2a. Increasing the field strength further decreases the band
gap until it reaches the saturation point and vanishes at a critical
electric field value (E⃗c), transforming
the NR from a semiconductor into a metal, as shown in Figure 2b. Such a reduction in the
band gap with an increase in electric field might be due to the quantum-confined
Stark effect (QCSE). Under this effect, when the electric field is
applied, the electron wavefunction in CB1 shifts against the electric
field direction and the hole wavefunction in VB1 shifts along the
electric field direction, decreasing the band gap value. A similar
observation has been reported for carbon nanotubes and armchair boron
nitride NRs (A-BNNRs) and MoS2 NRs.14,43,44 Therefore, the difference in the electrostatic
potential between the two edges created by the electric field may
be attributed to the QCSE phenomena. According to the discussion in
the previous section, the edge states play a key role in VB1 and CB1
formation in the A-GaNNR band structure. In the band structure under
the electric field of 0.2 V/Å strength, VB1 is formed mainly
from the edge N2 and the N atoms close to these N2, as shown in the bottom-right panel of Figure 2a. On the other hand, under the same field,
CB1 is primarily derived from edge Ga1 and N1 atoms (top-right panel in Figure 2a), with a minor contribution from the remaining N
atoms within the NR. As the field strength is increased to 0.6 V/Å,
the contribution of atoms to VB1 remains unchanged (bottom-left panel
in Figure 2b). However,
the states contributing to CB1 are located further away (the red/green
band shown in the top-left panel of Figure 2b) and are weakly bound to the NR (representing
significantly delocalized free carriers). These states lead to a rapid
decrease in the band gap to zero, altering the semiconducting properties
to metal-like characteristics, as shown in Figure 2b.

Figure 2 Band structures of 7-A-GaNNR for electric field
strengths of (a)
0.2 V/Å and (b) 0.6 V/Å. The right panel of figure (a) and
the left panel of figure (b) depict the partial charge densities of
VB1 (bottom) and CB1 (top) at 0.2 V/Å and 0.6 V/Å, respectively.
The red arrows indicate that the VB moves up and the CB moves down
due to field application, and the blue dashed box represents the unit
cell of 7-A-GaNNR. (c) Band gap as a function of external field strength
for various A-GaNNR widths.

No significant change in the band gap is observed when the field
polarity is reversed because atoms characterized by similar electronegativity
are present at both edges. The band structure corresponding to the
negative field strength (−0.4 V/Å) (in the sense defined
earlier) shows the same band gap as that obtained for the corresponding
positive field value (Figure S1 in the
Supporting Information). The atomic contributions to VB1 and CB1 formation
in the presence of a negative field remain the same as those under
the influence of a positive field (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information).

To examine the phenomenon
of material transformation from semiconducting
into metallic-like nature for other NR widths, we also performed calculations
for NRs of greater widths, as shown in Figure 2c. It can be seen that the band gap reduces
as the electric field strength increases for all widths considered
in this study and eventually vanishes under a strength of E⃗c, akin to the behavior observed for
the Na = 7 width. Indeed, as shown in Figure 2c, as the width increases,
the value of |Ec| decreases. For example,
the |Ec| value is 0.6 V/Å for Na = 7, whereas it decreases to 0.3 V/Å
for Na = 18. This phenomenon occurs because
a smaller NR width induces a larger separation between the conduction
band and the valence band levels due to greater quantum confinement.45 Such band gap behavior satisfies the condition
proposed by Sanvito et al.,14 confirming
that the |Ec| value required for band
gap closure is inversely proportional to the NR width (Figure 2c). Interestingly, we further
observed that across the entire electric field range examined in this
study, the band gap nature is direct at the Γ point until it
vanishes. This finding is in contrast to other materials (such as
armchair BNNRs and MoS2 NRs), where the CBM was found to
move slightly away from the Γ point toward the zone boundary
(X) as the electric field increases, leading to indirect band gap
behavior.14,43

Magnetic Properties of Bare A-GaNNRs Induced
by an External
Electric Field
The presence of high DOS around the Fermi
level near VB1 or CB1 transforms any nonmagnetic phase into a ferromagnetic
(FM) one.46−48 This phenomenon prompted us to further explore the
magnetic properties of the A-GaNNR by performing spin-polarized calculations
under different external electric field strengths. Under the external
electric field, the band structure of the A-GaNNR splits into spin-up
and spin-down channels, as shown in Figure 3a (7-A-GaNNR under 0.6 V/Å field strength),
leading to a finite MM. The A-GaNNR exhibits ferromagnetic properties
only under applied fields of strength exceeding the |Ec| values (when the transition from the semiconducting
to metallic NR nature occurs), as shown in Figure 3c. Figure 3a shows that both spin channels are metallic, owing
to significant DOS at the Fermi level. In this case, the polarized
carriers located near the Fermi level are fully delocalized and can
be hybridized by other states, due to which the entire material matrix
is polarized, inducing ferromagnetic properties. Interestingly, when
the intensity of the electric field increases further, the material
properties transform from metallic into half-metallic. In this case,
one of the spin gaps (spin-up or spin-down) exhibits semiconducting
and the other metallic nature,23 as shown
in Figure 3b. Similar
behavior was previously observed in zigzag graphene NRs and BNNRs.49−51 It is worth mentioning that the spin-polarized calculations are
performed for the fields below the critical points and no significant
change in the DOS is observed.

of (a) 0.6 V/Å and (b) 0.8 V/Å. The Fermi level has been
set at 0 eV and is represented by a dashed magenta line. (c) Magnetic
moment (MM) of 7-A-GaNNR and 10-A-GaNNR as a function of field strength.
(d) Spin density of a 7-A-GaNNR in the presence of a field of strength

To determine the origin of MM,
a spin density plot is drawn (Figure 3d), indicating that
it is derived primarily from the edge N2, with a minor
contribution from the N atom associated with the edge Ga2. The display of such diverse range of electronic properties modulated
by the external electric field makes bare A-GaNNRs suitable for a
wide range of applications. Such ferromagnetic behavior in these NRs
would enable their use in spintronic device applications. Thus, modulating
the electronic, structural, and magnetic properties by applying an
external electric field allows obtaining bare A-GaNNRs suitable for
a wide range of applications.

Electronic and Magnetic
Properties of O- and S-Passivated A-GaNNRs
Under practical
conditions, edge saturation is required to remove
the dangling bonds in NRs as a means of enhancing their stability
as well as removing defect states that trap carriers, resulting in
enhanced electronic and optical properties.52 Available evidence indicates that edge-functionalizing NRs with
chemical elements (passivation) induces a wide range of electronic
properties.53−55 For example, oxidization and sulfurization of graphene
and phosphorene NRs have been investigated to enhance their properties.56−58 In line with this prevalent trend, in this work, we present structural
and electronic properties of A-GaNNRs passivated with oxygen and sulfur
atoms. Figure 4a and Figure 4b show the atomic
structures of the passivated configurations, in which the passivating
atoms O (S) attached to the edge Ga atoms are labeled O1 and O3 (S1 and S3) and edge N atoms
are denoted as O2 and O4 (S2 and
S4). For full correspondence with the discussions pertaining
to the bare A-GaNNR, the results related to the O-A-GaNNRs and S-A-GaNNRs
are presented for width Na = 7. Figure 4c and Figure 4d show the band structure associated
with the configurations presented in Figure 4a,b, respectively, indicating that the band
structure is modified through chemical passivation compared to bare
A-GaNNRs, which can lead to different electric, optical, and magnetic
properties, as will be explained later.

(yellow and blue colors represent spin-up and spin-down states, respectively).

We found that, after passivation, the Ga–N
bond length near
the edges of O- and S-A-GaNNRs becomes 0.12 and 0.09 Å greater
than that obtained for the corresponding bare A-GaNNRs, as shown in Table 1. The Ga–O,
N–O, Ga–S, and N–S bond lengths of O- and S-A-GaNNRs
(1.74, 2.19, 1.64, and 1.28 Å, respectively) are presented in Table 1. The short N–O
bond length confirms the presence of a double bond between the two
atoms, and it matches the recently reported N–O bond length
in the O-doped 2D GaN ML.29 The distance
(2.27 Å) between two O atoms (see Figure 4a) is wide enough to prevent bond formation
between them, whereas a bond of 2.11 Å length is achieved between
S atoms (see Figure 4b). Introduction of passivating atoms in the O- and S-A-GaNNRs can
make them exhibit different electronic properties compared to those
of bare A-GaNNRs.

a Binding energy
(Eb) and Gibbs free energy of formation
(δG) of bare, O-, and S-A-GaNNRs for Na = 7 (NR width).

The binding energies of O-A-GaNNRs and S-A-GaNNRs
were calculated using the
following equation:59  where EX-A-GaNNR and EA-GaNNR are the total energies
of X-passivated and bare NRs, respectively, nX denotes the number of passivating atoms, and μX is the chemical potential of the passivating atom (X = O
or S). The negative binding energies indicate that both O and S atoms
are strongly attached, preventing their disassociation from the edges.
However, S atoms are more strongly bound when compared with O atoms,
as the binding energy of O-A-GaNNRs exceeds that characterizing S-A-GaNNRs
(the obtained values are presented in Table 1).

To identify the magnetic phases
that can be introduced in the material,
spin-unpolarized and spin-polarized calculations are performed. The
nonmagnetic (NM) band structure of O-A-GaNNR is presented in Figure 4c, indicating metallic
behavior, which is confirmed by the DOS shown in Figure S2 (Supporting Information), implying that O passivation
can introduce extensive carrier states. Moreover, four bands can be
noted around the Fermi level of the band structure of NM O-A-GaNNR,
two of which are degenerate (type I), and the remaining two are nondegenerate
(type II), as shown in Figure 4c. The left panel of Figure 4c shows the partial charge densities of the two types
of bands, allowing us to investigate the metallic behavior caused
by the bands at the Fermi level in the O-A-GaNNR in detail. As the
unit cell of the NR is presented in the xy-plane,
the px and py orbitals are located in the plane, whereas pz orbitals are perpendicular to the plane. From the partial
charge densities (left panel of Figure 4c), it is evident that type I bands are formed by nonbonding
pz orbitals of O1 and O3 and by hybridization of O2–N1 and O4–N2 bonds. These orbitals form
flat bands at the Fermi level (Figure 4c). On the other hand, type II bands are formed by
the px orbital of all
O atoms and edge N atoms. This finding is also supported by the PDOS
of edge Ga and O atoms (Figure S2 in the
Supporting Information).

Spin-polarized calculations show that
the O-A-GANNR exhibits magnetic
behavior. We considered both ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic
(AFM) configurations. The band structure presented in Figure 4e shows that the FM configuration
of O-passivated NRs comprises different nondegenerate spin-up (1.5
eV) and spin-down (1.09 eV) band gaps. On the other hand, as indicated
in Figure 4f, the AFM
configuration displays only one band gap (0.83 eV), as its spin-up
and spin-down bands overlap. The atomic contributions of type I and
type II bands of FM and AFM phases are similar to those noted for
the NM configuration, as shown in Figures S3 and S4 in the Supporting Information. The spin density plots of
FM and AFM configurations of O-A-GaNNR are presented in Figure 4g,h, respectively, revealing
that the O atoms provide the main magnetization contribution to both
configurations, while the contribution from the edge N atoms attached
to O is minimal. The FM configuration of O-A-GaNNR has a net MM of
3.12 μB irrespective of width because, as mentioned above, only
O and N atoms associated with the edges contribute to the MM. The
O atoms attached to the edge N atoms have an MM of 0.68 μB,
while those attached to the edge Ga atoms have an MM of 0.47 μB
at this width. On the other hand, the AFM configuration has a zero
net MM because of the equal contribution from spin-up and spin-down
states, as shown in Figure 4h. The MMs of O and N atoms (O2 and N1) are antiferromagnetically aligned with the same atoms (O4 and N2) at the opposite edge, as shown in the AFM spin
density plot (denoted by blue and yellow), but their atomic MM values
are equal to those obtained in the FM case.

The total energy
difference ΔE between FM
and NM configurations (FM–NM) of 7-O-A-GaNNR is thus ΔE = 870 meV per unit cell, favoring FM through O passivation.
As this value is considerably higher than the energy at room temperature
(25 meV), it suggests that 7-O-A-GaNNR would retain strong magnetic
features. For width Na = 7, the FM phase
energy is higher than that obtained for the AFM case (FM–AFM
= 0.53 meV), and the difference becomes significantly smaller for
larger widths (e.g., 0.04 meV is obtained for Na = 20). These results indicate that NRs of optimized width
can be promising candidates for spintronic applications requiring
strong and stable magnetic characteristics.

The S-A-GaNNR exhibits
semiconductor characteristics in contrast
to the O-A-GaNNR. However, the S-A-GaNNR has an indirect band gap
nature (Eg = 0.92 eV), as its CBM and
VBM occur at different highly symmetric Brillouin zone points, Γ
and X, respectively, as shown in Figure 4d. For the S-A-GaNNR, the unpaired pz electrons of S atoms at both edges (S1 and S2, as well as those of S3 and
S4) participate in bond hybridization. These S bonds eliminate
the bands formed by the orbitals of unbounded atoms at the edges.
Consequently, S-A-GaNNRs exhibit nonmagnetic properties, as unpaired
electrons are not available. These findings demonstrate that S passivation
transforms the band structure from a direct (in bare A-GaNNRs) into
an indirect band gap without inducing any magnetic properties, as
there are no states overlapping with the Fermi level, as shown in
the PDOS of S-A-GaNNR (Figure S5 in the
Supporting Information). VB1 originates from the edge passivating S atoms and edge N atoms and
CB1 is derived from all atoms within the NRs apart from Ga atoms located
at the NR edge, as shown in the right panel of Figure 4d.

Electric Field Effects on O- and S-Passivated
A-GaNNR Properties
The above discussion of the passivated
NRs pertains to the case
under zero electric field. Here, we discuss the combined effect of
electric field and chemical passivation on the NRs. For O-passivated
NRs, we consider only FM configurations to investigate the effect
of the electric field on the O-A-GaNNR properties, as the energy difference
between the FM and AFM configurations is very small. Similar to its
bare counterpart, the band gap of the 7-O-A-GaNNR decreases as the
field increases. Figure 5a presents the electronic DOS of 7-O-A-GaNNR in response to a field
strength of 0.8 V/Å, which shows that both spin-up and spin-down
channels exhibit metallic behavior. The DOS for lower field strengths
(0.1, 0.3, and 0.6 V/Å) are shown in Figure S6 in the Supporting Information. The |Ec| value for this NR is ∼0.3 V/Å. As discussed
in the preceding section, O-A-GaNNRs are magnetic in the absence of
the external field and retain this behavior when the electric field
is applied. We also established that their magnetic contribution originates
from the same atoms that contributed to the FM phase in the absence
of the external field, as shown in Figure 5c. The MM of the NR decreases slightly when
the electric field strength increases, as shown in Figure 5b.

For S-passivated NRs, the band structure of 7-S-A-GaNNRs under
a field strength of 0.2 V/Å is shown in Figure 6, where it can be clearly seen that the band
gap reduces gradually (Figure 6b), in line with the behavior observed in bare A-GaNNRs. We
also found that the field strength (0.3 V/Å) required to transform
a S-A-GaNNR into a metallic material (see Figure S7 in the Supporting Information) is lower than that needed
for its bare counterpart (0.6 V/Å), due to the smaller band gap
in the passivated ones compared to bare ones.

Similar to the bare counterpart, the external electric
field induces
FM behavior in S-A-GaNNR when its strength exceeds the |Ec| value and the MM of S-A-GaNNR gradually increases as
the field strength increases, as shown in Figure 6c. The NR MM reaches 0.12 μB for 0.5 V/Å, decreasing to 0.03 μB under 0.6
V/Å. The low MM corresponding to the field strength of 0.6 V/Å
is due to AFM spin alignment between the edges, as shown in Figure 6e. The net MM between
the spin-up and spin-down states results in a lower magnetic moment
value for this particular field strength. However, the MM maximum
of 0.23 μB is obtained by further increasing the
electric field to 1 V/Å. The spin density plots presented in Figure 6d show that one side
of the edge S atoms provides the main contribution to the MMs. Beyond
the |Ec| value, total energy differences
suggest that the FM phase becomes more favorable than the NM phase
as the field increases. For example, the ΔE values of 0.14 and 40 meV are obtained when 0.5 and 1 V/Å are
applied to S-A-GaNNRs, respectively.

From the above discussion,
it is evident that edge oxidization
induces magnetic behavior in A-GaNNRs and modulates the band structure.
On the other hand, edge functionalization with sulfur induces magnetic
behavior in S-A-GaNNRs in the presence of an external electric field.
Furthermore, bare A-GaNNRs show half-metallic behavior when subjected
to field strengths beyond the critical value. Thus, these findings
indicate that A-GaNNRs can be utilized in the fabrication of a wide
range of electronic, optoelectronic, and spintronic devices.

As the PBE functional underestimates the band gap values, we carried
out calculations for several field strengths using the HSE60 functional, and the resulting band gap behavior
is presented in Figure S8 in the Supporting
Information. Thus, it is expected that, in practice, larger electric
fields would be required to transform the material from a semiconductor
into a metal compared to values yielded by the PBE calculations.

Width Dependence and Relative Thermal Stability of A-GaNNRs
Width Dependence
Thus far in this work, the band gaps
of the bare and O- and S-passivated A-GaNNRs are presented only for
the width of Na = 7. Hence, the band gaps
as a function of width in the absence of external electric field are
discussed here. Figure 7a presents the band gap nature for the widths ranging from Na = 6 to 20 for the three configurations, revealing
that the resulting behavior coincides with that reported in the preceding
sections. The band gaps of bare A-GaNNRs increase slightly as the
NR width increases. On the other hand, the band gaps of S-A-GaNNRs
decrease as the NR width increases. Moreover, for the FM phase of
O-A-GaNNRs, spin-up gaps increase and spin-down gaps decrease as a
function of width, while the AFM phase band gaps are independent of
the NR width.

Figure 7 (a) Band gap values of the bare and O- and S-passivated
A-GaNNRs
as a function of their width. The depicted spin-up and spin-down band
gaps pertain to the case of O-A-GaNNRs. (b) Formation energies of
bare and O- and S-passivated A-GaNNRs as a function of the width.

Relative Thermal Stability
Thermal
stability of the
active material is one of the most important practical device characteristics.
Consequently, we assessed the stability of both bare and passivated
NRs by calculating the Gibbs free energies of NR formation (δG) using the following equation:61  where Ec is the
cohesive energy per atom of the NR and xGaN, xO, and xS are the molar fractions of the GaN dimer and O and S atoms, respectively;
μGaN denotes the chemical potential of the GaN dimer
calculated by cohesive energy per unit cell of the 2D GaN ML; and
μO and μS represent the chemical
potentials of the O and S atoms calculated from an isolated O2 molecule and a S8 ring, respectively. The atomic
structure of the S8 ring was obtained from Materials Project.62

The calculated δG values are presented in Table 1. Generally, for any system, lower formation energy
yields higher stability. The δG values of the
NRs in this study show that their stability can be increased by passivating
the dangling bonds at the edges. For width Na = 7, δG obtained for the bare NR is
0.26 and 0.33 eV/atom higher than the values obtained for the O- and
S-A-GaNNR, respectively. Moreover, δG for the
O-A-GaNNR is 0.24 eV/atom lower than that pertaining to the S-A-GaNNR,
indicating that O-passivated NRs are the most stable among all NRs
considered here. We also calculated the formation energies as a function
of width, and the results presented in Figure 7b indicate that the δG of bare A-GaNNRs decreases with increasing width, suggesting that
wider ribbons are more stable relative to the narrower ones. The δG value of S-A-GaNNRs decreases with increasing width but
becomes independent of the NR width beyond Na = 12. On the other hand, δG of O-A-GaNNRs
is weakly dependent on their width, but low formation energies indicate
much higher stability, as shown in Figure 7b.

The formation energies δG presented in the
preceding section were calculated at zero temperature. To demonstrate
the stability of A-GaNNRs at higher temperatures, we carried out AIMD
stimulations at room temperature (300 K) and at a high temperature
(800 K), as shown in Figure 8. Our findings reveal that the total energy fluctuations for
the GaNNRs at 300 and 800 K are in the 0.2–0.3 and 0.3–0.4
eV range, respectively. Although atoms vibrate around their equilibrium
positions, no structural deformations occur in the geometric structures
of bare and S-A-GaNNRs. On the other hand, as the edge O atoms in
the O-A-GaNNR configuration move away from the NR edges, this results
in a long range of fluctuations. At high temperatures, the S-A-GaNNR
is the most stable configuration among the three NRs studied here,
indicating that introducing S during GaNNR fabrication is necessary
for improving material stability.

and O-A-GaNNRs at 300 K

Conclusions
In this work, the electronic
and magnetic properties of bare A-GaNNRs
and O- and S-A-GaNNRs were investigated by means of first-principles
calculations both in the absence and under the influence of an external
electric field of 0.1–1 V/Å strength. Our findings revealed
that the band gap of bare A-GaNNRs decreased with increasing field
strength and vanished at a critical value. Beyond this threshold,
the A-GaNNRs exhibited magnetic properties, and the material properties
were transformed from semiconducting to metallic nature upon increasing
the electric field. A half-metallic material was obtained by further
increasing the external electric field. We found that the O-A-GaNNRs
were spin-polarized magnetic materials with a finite magnetic moment
and existed in both FM and AFM phases. On the other hand, S-A-GaNNRs
were nonmagnetic, but their band structure could be transformed from
a direct into an indirect band gap. However, S-A-GaNNRs exhibited
metallic nature under lower electric field strength than that required
for their bare counterparts. The formation energy calculations indicated
that the passivated NRs were more stable than their bare counterparts.
AIMD simulations at 300 and 800 K further showed that all A-GaNNRs
studied were stable at room temperature. The S-A-GaNNR was the most
stable configuration at high temperatures among all A-GaNNRs. Therefore,
the results reported here showed that A-GaNNRs can be good candidates
for a wide range of electronic, optoelectronic, and spintronic device
applications. It may not be presently possible to obtain such a large electric field
to operate devices; however, it can be suitable for potential applications
requiring a very small electric field in the future.
