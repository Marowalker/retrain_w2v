Photodetectors
are a class of critical optoelectronic devices that
can transform incident light into a detectable electrical signal.
In this work, we develop a novel photodetector based on two-dimensional
(2D) confined electron donor–acceptor co-assembled ultrathin
films (UTFs). The (PCDTBT@CN-PPV/LDHs)n UTFs are composed of an organic electron donor, poly[N-9′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)]
(PCDTBT), and an acceptor, poly(5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-2-methoxy-cyanoterephthalylidene)
(CN-PPV), within inorganic Mg2Al-layered double hydroxides
(LDHs). The UTFs exhibit broad-range visible-light absorption, from
400 to 650 nm, resulting from complementary absorption of PCDTBT and
CN-PPV. The fluorescence emission of the UTFs is completely quenched,
implying the occurrence of photoinduced charge transfer (PCT). As
a novel photodetector, the co-assembled UTFs have a high photocurrent
and on/off switching ratio (300 nA/∼120), in contrast to those
of the PCDTBT/CN-PPV drop-casting thin film (5.4 nA/∼1.6);
a fast response; a short recovery time (lower than 0.1 s); and excellent
wavelength and light-intensity dependence. The PCT mechanism can be
attributed to the formation of a 2D bulk heterojunction of the two
polymers within the interlayers of the LDH nanosheets. Furthermore,
flexible UTFs on polyethylene terephthalate substrates are also fabricated,
which exhibit excellent folding strength and electrical stability.

1 Introduction
Photodetectors
that can transform incident light into electrical
current are widely applied in industrial and scientific fields, for
example, optical communications, aeronautical engineering, and biological
and environmental investigations.1 Photodetectors
based on inorganic nanostructures, such as ZnO, V2O5, ZrS2, and ZnS, which exhibit excellent nanoscaled
optoelectronic performances, have been widely investigated.2 Recently, a multicolor (responding to both UV
and visible light) photodetector based on the heterojunction of n-Si(111)/TiO2 nanorod arrays was developed using interface engineering,
a consecutive process including chemical etching, magnetron sputtering,
hydrothermal growth, and assembly.3 However,
the complicated preparation technology and requirement for high-cost
equipment greatly restrict their practical applications.4 Furthermore, most inorganic photodetector materials
had fixed light absorption and a narrow spectral sensitivity,2 which would be suitable for only fixed or narrow-band
wavelength detection. For example, the first GaS-nanosheet-based photodetectors
made on SiO2/Si and flexible polyethylene terephthalate
(PET) substrates exhibited photoresponsivities up to 4.2 and 19.2
AW–1 at 254 nm, respectively, due to the strong
absorption in the UV wavelength region.5

Recently, a few organic
molecules with various types, a broad-band absorption range, and excellent
flexibility have become suitable candidates for photodetectors. A
novel kind of flexible photodetector based on perovskite/conjugated-polymer
composites exhibited a wide photoresponse from 365 to 937 nm.6 The excellent photodetector performances were
ascribed to the efficient photoinduced charge transfer (PCT) and exciton
dissociation between the electron donor and acceptor, with a coupled
energy level. Meanwhile, organic molecules
easily formed flexible films on solution processing,7 which was the key advantage in practical application. Consequently,
several types of organic photodetectors based on electron donors and
acceptors generated considerable interests.8 Liu et al. prepared an ultrathin organic photodetector that used
the P3HT:PCBM blend as a photoactive layer.9 This device exhibited a remarkable performance, with a detectivity
of 1.33 × 1012 Jones at 500 nm irradiation, comparable
to the detectivity of state-of-the-art inorganic photodetectors. Undeniably,
organic donor and acceptor blends have great potential in the field
of photodetectors, and further exploitation is highly essential to
improve their abilities and expand their field of application.

Poly[N-9′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)]
(PCDTBT) has been widely used in photovoltaic applications, with outstanding
chemical stability, good organization, excellent solubility, and high
photon-to-electron conversion efficiency.10 Meanwhile, poly(5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-2-methoxy-cyanoterephthalylidene)
(CN-PPV) usually acts as an electron acceptor in photoelectric devices,
such as organic light-emitting diodes and organic solar cells, due
to its lower electron energy levels, with electron withdrawing groups
as substituents.11 However, to the best
of our knowledge, PCDTBT and CN-PPV, individually or combination,
have not been investigated until now in the field of photodetectors.
Layered
double hydroxides (LDHs) are a kind of important two-dimensional (2D)
layered solid solution with unique versatility due to their adjustable
anionic composition in galleries,12 and
importantly, LDHs can confine intercalated guests and modulate their
electronic properties.

In this work, 2D confined polymer electron
donor (PCDTBT)/acceptor
(CN-PPV) ultrathin films ((PCDTBT@CN-PPV/LDHs)n UTFs) were fabricated by the layer-by-layer assembly technique,
which was different from the traditional simple blending method. The
fluorescence emission of the UTFs was quenched when the mass ratio
of PCDTBT to CN-PPV was 1:1, indicating the occurrence of PCT between
PCDTBT and CN-PPV within the LDH interlayers.13 Furthermore, PCDTBT and CN-PPV exhibited complementary visible absorption
spectra, which played a crucial role in enhancing the sensitivity
of the photodetector devices.14 The co-assembled
photodetectors on both rigid substrates and flexible PET substrates
had enhanced photoresponsive properties compared to those of drop-casted
PCDTBT/CN-PPV thin films, which were highly appreciated for their
electronic applications. Therefore, the 2D confined electron donor–acceptor
systems fabricated as novel photodetectors had the following advantages:
(1) the 2D confined nanoscale interlayers of the UTFs were highly
favorable for PCT and electron transport due to the well-organized
distribution of PCDTBT and CN-PPV within the Mg2Al-LDH
nanosheets, something like the 2D bulk heterojunction; (2) the positively
charged LDH layers could attract photogenerated electrons and repel
photogenerated holes, which contributed to improving the charge separation
and diffusion in the nanospace; (3) the stability and durability of
the novel co-assembled photodetectors were enhanced due to the immobilization
of the electron donor/acceptor within Mg2Al-LDH nanosheets.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Structural and Morphology
of (PCDTBT@CN-PPV/LDHs)n UTFs
(PCDTBT/LDHs)n, (CN-PPV/LDHs)n, and
(PCDTBT@CN-PPV/LDHs)n UTFs were prepared
by the layer-by-layer assembly method. First, the influence of PCDTBT/CN-PPV
weight ratios on fluorescence emission was investigated. It was noted
that UTFs with a 1:1 weight ratio showed completely quenched luminescence
(Figure S1a), a direct reflection of the
occurrence of PCT between PCDTBT and CN-PPV.13 For simplicity, the co-assembled films with 1:1 weight ratio have
been denoted as (PCDTBT@CN-PPV/LDHs)n UTFs.
As shown in Figure S2, the characteristic
UV–vis absorption peaks of PCDTBT (0.05 g/L) and CN-PPV (0.05
g/L) solutions in toluene were located at 400 and 550 nm and 450 nm,
respectively. Concerning the UV–vis absorption of (PCDTBT/LDHs)n UTFs and (CN-PPV/LDHs)n UTFs, however, no significant changes were observed compared
to those in toluene solutions (Figures S2 and S3), indicating that the single-assembled polymers kept their
original structures as those in solutions. In other words, the 2D
confined individual polymer, PCDTBT or CN-PPV, achieved a homogeneous
interlayer distribution within LDHs.

The multilayered co-assembly process
for the formation of (PCDTBT@CN-PPV/LDHs)n UTFs was monitored by UV–vis absorption spectroscopy. The
results showed that the absorption intensities at 400, 450, and 550
nm increased linearly with increasing co-assembled cycle number (n) (Figure 1a), implying that the film growth was uniform and regular and encapsulation
of PCDTBT and CN-PPV into LDH interlayers occurred. It was noted that
the co-assembled UTFs exhibited broadened visible light absorption
from 400 to 650 nm due to the complementary absorption of PCDTBT and
CN-PPV, which was highly favorable for light absorption. Although
PCDTBT and CN-PPV
were neutral polymers without any net charge, they were co-assembled
within LDH nanosheets through hydrogen-bond interactions, N···H–O/O···H–O,
which originated from the carbazole and benzothiadiazole groups in
PCDTBT, ethylhexyloxy and methoxy groups in CN-PPV, and hydroxyl groups
in the LDH layers.15 Consequently, (PCDTBT@CN-PPV/LDHs)n UTFs with a cycle number (n) of up to 20 can be obtained, and it can be expected that the two
neutral polymers can interact with each other through π–π
interactions within the LDH interlayers.

(b) PL emission spectra of (PCDTBT/LDHs)20 UTFs, (CN-PPV/LDHs)20 UTFs, and (PCDTBT@CN-PPV/LDHs)20 UTFs; (c) photographs
of (PCDTBT/LDHs)n UTFs (up), (CN-PPV/LDHs)n UTFs
(middle), and (PCDTBT@CN-PPV/LDHs)n UTFs
(bottom) (from left to right, n = 4, 8, 12, 16, 20)
under irradiation at 364 nm UV light; (d) XRD patterns of (PCDTBT@CN-PPV/LDHs)n UTFs.

Compared with the PCDTBT/CN-PPV solution (Figure S1b), the single-assembled UTFs displayed the same luminescence
peaks at 652 and 556 nm, respectively, without any shift or broadening
with increasing n (Figure S4), indicating that there were no distinct changes in the microenvironment
of the polymers throughout the assembly process. In contrast, the
co-assembled UTFs showed significant luminescence quenching due to
the occurrence of PCT (Figure 1b). Correspondingly, photographs of the (PCDTBT/LDHs)n UTFs and (CN-PPV/LDHs)n UTFs under 365 nm UV illumination showed visible red and yellow
luminescence, respectively, with the brightness increasing with increasing n (Figure 1c), whereas the co-assembled (PCDTBT@CN-PPV/LDHs)n UTFs did not show any fluorescence.

The periodic structure
of the UTFs was evaluated through XRD patterns
(Figure 1d). The intensity
at about 2θ = 1.5° increased with increasing n, suggesting a well-ordered periodic stacking of the UTFs in the
normal direction, with a period of about 5.89 nm, which was similar
to that of the layer spacing of one LDH layer (0.48 nm) plus the lateral
dimension of PCDTBT (2.37 nm) and CN-PPV (2.18 nm) (Figure S5). It can be speculated
that PCDTBT and CN-PPV were arranged as entangled bilayers within
LDH nanosheets.

The surface morphologies of (PCDTBT/LDHs)20 UTFs, (CN-PPV/LDHs)20 UTFs, and (PCDTBT@CN-PPV/LDHs)20 UTFs were observed
by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy
(AFM). The top-view SEM images (Figure S6) showed that all three UTF surfaces were continuous and homogeneous,
with an average film thickness of ca. 100 nm. The AFM images (scan
= 2 μm × 2 μm) (Figure S7) also indicated that the surfaces of the films were uniform and
smooth, with an average roughness root-mean-square of less than 4
nm (n = 20).

2.2 Estimation
of the Energy Level of (PCDTBT@CN-PPV/LDHs)n UTFs
The highest occupied molecular
orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy
levels of the polymers can be calculated from the onset potentials
of cyclic voltammogram (CV) measurements (Figures S8 and S9).16 The energy levels
of PCDTBT and CN-PPV within LDH interlayers were evaluated from the
CV curves of (PCDTBT/LDHs)20 UTFs and (CN-PPV/LDHs)20 UTFs, respectively, provided that there were no significant
differences between single-assembly and co-assembly processes. The
measured energy-level values are listed in Table S1 for comparison. As shown in Figure S8, the CV
curves of PCDTBT, CN-PPV, (PCDTBT/LDHs)20 UTFs, and (CN-PPV/LDHs)20 UTFs show one oxidation process and one reduction process
each, implying their excellent ambient stabilities.17 It was noted that the HOMO/LUMO levels of PCDTBT and CN-PPV
within LDHs were −5.35/–3.85 and −5.60/–3.95
eV, respectively, which was in good accordance with the required energy
levels for the PCT process.18 Meanwhile,
the slight difference in energy levels between the co-assembled PCDTBT
(or CN-PPV) and pristine PCDTBT (or CN-PPV) was ascribed to the 2D
confined effect of LDHs.

Furthermore, all of the Eg values estimated from the absorption edge were very
close to those calculated from the CV measurements, implying the reliability
of the energy levels from the CV measurements.19 The Eg’s of PCDTBT and
CN-PPV within LDHs estimated from the absorption edge were also narrowed
compared to those of pristine PCDTBT and CN-PPV, corresponding to
the systematically red-shifted absorption onset by ∼40/10 nm.

2.3 Photoresponse Properties of (PCDTBT@CN-PPV/LDHs)n UTFs
The photoresponse performances
were explored by a prototype photodetector that was fabricated by
casting the silver electrode onto UTFs. Figure 2a shows the current–voltage (I–V) curves of the devices under
white light and dark environments. For the co-assembled UTFs, a photocurrent
of 300 nA was detected at a voltage of 3.0 V, whereas only 45 and
34 nA were observed for single-assembled UTFs. Furthermore, the logarithmic
relationships of the current and voltage for co-assembled UTFs under
light and dark conditions were replotted in Figure 2b, suggesting the prominent photoconductive
behaviors.

Figure 2 (a) I–V curves and (b)
logarithmic I–V curves of
the (PCDTBT@CN-PPV/LDHs)20 UTF co-assembly photodetector

switching; and (d) response and recovery times of the photocurrent
for the (PCDTBT@CN-PPV/LDHs)20 UTF photodetector on a silicon
substrate.

The crucial factors for determining
the capability of a photodetector
were its sensitivity and repeatability.20Figure 2c shows that
the photocurrent of the UTFs rise and fall with on/off switching of
the incident light. For the co-assembled UTFs, dark current was only
2.5 nA, whereas photocurrent approached 300 nA at a bias voltage of
3.0 V under an incident light intensity of 150 mW cm–2, giving an on/off switching ratio of 120. Furthermore, the co-assembled
UTFs exhibited an outstanding symmetric photocurrent, with no obvious
degradation during seven cycles, indicating excellent photosensitivity
of the device, which is close to performance of state-of-the-art organic–inorganic
hybrid photodetectors.20 In contrast, devices
based on CN-PPV-only and PCDTBT-only UTFs exhibited relatively low
photocurrents of 50 and 36 nA under the same illumination conditions,
about 7 and 5 times enhancement compared to those under dark currents
of 7.1 and 7.0 nA, respectively. The light on/off current also changed
slowly due to the weak sensitivity. This could be ascribed to the
fact that the charge transportation efficiency between PCDTBT and
CN-PPV within the LDH nanosheets was much higher than that in the
single-assembled UTFs under light illumination.21 For comparison, the photocurrents and on/off ratios of
pristine PCDTBT, CN-PPV, and PCDTBT@CN-PPV (1:1) drop-casting films
on silicon substrates were measured to be 2.5 nA/1.5, 2.2 nA/1.2,
and 5.4 nA/1.6, respectively (Figure 3). The improvements in the photocurrent and on/off
ratio for LDH-based co-assembled UTFs were ascribed to the effective
PCT process between the 2D confined PCDTBT and CN-PPV within the LDH
interlayers and the nanometer dimension of the polymer@LDH nanocomposites,
which was favorable for photogenerated carrier transport.

and (b) reproducible on/off switching of the PCDTBT, CN-PPV, and PCDTBT@CN-PPV
(1:1) films dropped on the silicon substrate at 150 mW cm–2 illumination.

Usually, the time at
which the initial current increased to 90%
or decreased to 10% of the peak value was defined as the rise or decay
time of the photodetector. More detailed transient photocurrents of
the UTF device are presented in Figure 2d. It was observed that both the rise and decay times
for co-assembled UTFs were shorter than 0.1 s, which was comparable
to those for P3HT and CdSe nanowire heterojunctions.22 Consequently, the rapid reversibility response and high
stability of the co-assembled UTFs allowed their use in promising
high-quality photodetector applications.

2.4 Photoresponsive
Wavelength Dependence of (PCDTBT@CN-PPV/LDHs)n UTFs
The co-assembled (PCDTBT@CN-PPV/LDHs)20 UTFs also exhibited excellent wavelength dependence. Figure S10 shows full I–V sweeps of the co-assembled and single-assembled UTFs when
illuminated with visible light from 400 to 650 nm (150 mW cm–2). Figure 4a summarizes
the I–λ relationships of the devices
at a voltage of 3.0 V. For (PCDTBT@CN-PPV/LDHs)20 UTFs,
the photocurrent increased gradually from 400 to 500 nm and then decreased
at 500 nm, which was well in accordance with the UV–vis absorption
spectra (Figure 4b).
It was observed that the photoconductance exhibited a quick response
to the excitation wavelength, which was ascribed to the various concentrations
of photoexcited electron–hole pairs under different wavelengths
of light (400–650 nm). The strong absorption could stimulate
the electrons from the HOMO to the LUMO and provide more carriers
for the photocurrent, a fact that the photogenerated electrons and
holes were proportional to the absorbed photon flux, leading to excellent
wavelength dependence.22 It should be pointed
out that the highest photocurrent was observed at 500 nm, whereas
the maximum absorption of (PCDTBT@CN-PPV/LDHs)20 UTFs was
at about 400 nm. The lower photocurrent at 400 nm was possibly attributed
to the enhanced absorption of high-energy photons at or near the surface
region of the hybrid semiconductors,23 which
was a common phenomenon in other broad-band photodetectors.22 The single-assembled UTFs also exhibited photocurrent–wavelength
dependence. However, the photocurrents were much lower due to the
lower absorption and single-component with lower electron/hole efficiency.24

a bias voltage of 3.0 V; (b) UV–vis absorption spectra of (PCDTBT/LDHs)20 UTFs, (CN-PPV/LDHs)20 UTFs, and (PCDTBT@CN-PPV/LDHs)20 UTFs.

2.5 Photoresponsive
Intensity Dependence of (PCDTBT@CN-PPV/
LDHs)n UTFs
The photosensitivities
(i.e., light response ability) of the co-assembled UTFs were evaluated
under different incident light intensities from 0.5 to 150 mW cm–2. As shown in Figure 5a, the I–V curves at different illumination intensities exhibited typical photoconductive
behavior, with increased electric conductivity at a higher light intensity.
It was noted that a slight change in light intensity could result
in an obvious response in photocurrent, which could be attributed
to the different photon densities.25 The
co-assembled UTF device exhibited a nearly linear photocurrent–light
intensity relationship, with a power law of θ = 0.88 (i.e., I ∼ P0.88) (Figure 5b), well in accordance
with the previously reported value (0.5 < θ < 1), suggesting
a powerful light-intensity dependence.26 These results confirmed the great potential of 2D confined electron
donor–acceptor UTFs in the field of highly sensitive photodetectors.

intensity.

2.6 Mechanism
of Photoresponsive Properties of
(PCDTBT@CN-PPV/LDHs)20 UTFs
A schematic description
of the UTF photodetector has been presented in Figure 6a, which is composed of highly smooth and
homogeneous UTFs, silver electrodes, and a rigid SiO2/Si
substrate. The coupled and matched energy levels of PCDTBT and CN-PPV
within LDH nanosheets allowed the occurrence of PCT under irradiation,
thus producing photoexcited electrons and holes (Figure 6b). Then, the electrons could
be accepted by the Ag positive electrode, with a relatively lower
energy level compared to that of the LUMO of CN-PPV; meanwhile, the
holes could be caught by the Ag negative electrode, with a relatively
higher energy level compared to that of the HOMO of PCDTBT.27 In our system, the polymers within LDH interlayers
exhibited a relatively orderly and dense arrangement, which was highly
favorable for exciton dissociation and carrier transport.28 Meanwhile, the positively charged LDH nanosheets
could attract photogenerated electrons and repel holes, which played
a dominating role in the exciton dissociation and carrier transport
within the interlayers (Figure 6c). Effective exciton separation and smooth carrier transport
were achieved within the 2D confined interlayers upon illumination,
leading to the highest photocurrent in the co-assembled UTFs (Figure 2a). Therefore, greatly
enhanced photoresponse for the co-assembled UTFs was achieved, compared
to that for the single-assembly or drop-casting devices.

2.7 Photodetectors Based on (PCDTBT@CN-PPV/LDHs)20 Flexible UTFs
Recently, the preparation of flexible
electronic and optoelectronic devices has gained great interest due
to their prosperity in the fields of portable and hand-held electronics.29 In this work, we developed a flexible photodetector
by co-assembling neutral polymers and LDH nanosheets onto a flexible
PET substrate to explore its photoresponse performance. It was noted
that the flexible photodetector exhibited excellent photocurrent stability
and sensitivity (Figure S11), with a photocurrent
of 15 nA and an on/off ratio of 118 for at least five cycles. The
flexible device also showed excellent wavelength dependence (Figure S12) and light-intensity dependence (Figure S13). Compared to the photocurrent on
the rigid substrate, the much lower value for the flexible substrate
could be attributed to the lower charge-carrier-transport efficiency
on the PET substrate.30

For practical
application of photodetectors, information on their durability and
endurance is commonly desired. It was worth noting that the I–V curves of the flexible (PCDTBT@CN-PPV/LDHs)20 UTF devices remained almost constant even after 150 cycles
of bending compared to those of the original flexible one (Figure 7a,b). No obvious
degradation was detected for a continuous photocurrent of ∼15
nA under fixed voltage and light illumination over 1800 s, implying
excellent photocurrent stability, which was mainly attributed to the
immobilization of LDH nanosheets. As shown in Figure S14, the photocurrent of the flexible UTFs was almost
not influenced by the external bending stress under five different
bending states. All of these suggested a high folding strength, excellent
flexibility, and electrical stability of the co-assembled flexible
UTFs, implying their great potential in photodetector applications.

co-assembled flexible UTFs (a) after 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 cycles
of bending; (b) corresponding enlarged figure (illumination of visible
light, 150 mW cm–2).

2.8 Comparison among Various Organic–Inorganic
Hybrid Photodetectors
Until now, there have been few reports
on 2D confined organic electron donor–acceptor thin films for
high-performance photodetector applications. Table 1 shows a comparison among various organic–inorganic
hybrid photodetectors related to this work. It was noted that only
our co-assembled films have a broadened spectral response with excellent
spectral dependence. Although some devices with an organic–inorganic
structure showed higher on/off ratios than those of the co-assembled
films, their response/recovery times were systematically longer than
those of our co-assembled photodetector. Moreover, the co-assembled
2D confined systems in this work have the advantages of easy fabrication
compared with the traditional complicated preparation technology and
enhanced photosensitivity due to the 2D confined effect of LDH nanosheets.

3.1 Materials
PCDTBT ((C43H47N3S3)nC12H10, Mw = 20 000–100 000)
and CN-PPV ((C36H46N2O4)n) were both provided by Sigma Chemical
Co., Ltd. Mg(NO3)2·6H2O, Al(NO3)3·9H2O, urea, formamide, and toluene
were all of analytical grade and obtained from Beijing Chemical Factory,
China. SiO2 (300 nm)/Si wafer and silver paste were provided
by J&K Co., Ltd.

3.2 Fabrication of (PCDTBT@CN-PPV/LDHs)n UTFs
The fabrication and exfoliation
of
Mg2Al-LDHs have been described in our previous work.37 Mg2Al-LDH (0.1 g) was stirred in
100 mL of formamide solution for 24 h to produce a stable exfoliated
Mg2Al-LDH suspension. The quartz glass substrate
was first washed in a mixed solution of concentrated NH3 (30%) and H2O2 (volume ratio 7:3) and in concentrated
H2SO4 for 30 min each. Thereafter, the substrate
was washed thoroughly with deionized water. The substrate was dipped
in an LDH suspension (1 g/L) for 15 min. After washing with deionized
water, the substrate was then dipped in PCDTBT toluene solution (0.05
g/L), CN-PPV toluene solution (0.05 g/L), or PCDTBT@CN-PPV toluene
solution (PCDTBT 0.05 g/L and CN-PPV 0.05 g/L) for 15 min and washed
with ethanol. (PCDTBT/LDHs)n, (CN-PPV/LDHs)n, or (PCDTBT@CN-PPV/LDHs)n UTFs were prepared by alternately depositing the LDH suspension
and PCDTBT toluene solution, CN-PPV toluene solution, or PCDTBT@CN-PPV
toluene solution for n cycles. The fabricated UTFs
were dried under N2 flow for 2 min. A quartz substrate
and indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass were used for optical and
CV optoelectronic measurements, respectively. An SiO2 (300
nm)/Si wafer substrate and flexible ITO-coated PET were applied for
photoresponse measurements. Silver paste was coated onto the hybrid
film (SiO2 (300 nm)/Si wafer substrate), with a spacing
of 1 mm. The device was then dried in a vacuum oven for 2 h to firm
the silver paste. Flexible photodetectors were constructed on flexible
ITO-coated PET using a similar preparation technique as that for the
rigid ones. Comparison samples of a drop-casted PCDTBT film, CN-PPV
film, and PCDTBT@CN-PPV film were fabricated by the traditional solvent
evaporation technique.

3.3 Characterization
The surface morphology
of the UTFs was observed by SEM (Hitachi S4800) at an accelerating
voltage of 5 kV. AFM (Nano Scope Analysis, Bruker, Germany) was carried
out to measure the surface roughness and thickness of the UTFs. UV–vis
absorption spectra were obtained on a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu
U-3600), ranging from 200 to 900 nm. Fluorescence spectra of PCDTBT
and CN-PPV were collected on a Hitachi F-7000 fluorospectrophotometer,
with excitation wavelengths of 460 and 490 nm, respectively. The excitation
and emission slits were both set as 5 nm.

3.4 Photoresponse
Measurements
Electronic
and optoelectronic measurements were carried out in a three-electrode
system on an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E; CH Instruments
Inc., China). The ferrocene–ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+)
redox couple (4.8 eV below the vacuum level) was applied as the internal
standard, and Ag/Ag+ (0.1 M AgNO3 in acetonitrile)
was applied as the reference electrode. The different wavelengths
(from 365 to 700 nm) of light emitted from a 300 W Xe lamp were focused
by a monochromator. The incident power light was tested by a power
meter (CEL-NP2000). All of the tests were carried out in air at room
temperature.

4 Conclusions
In summary,
a novel 2D confined (PCDTBT@CN-PPV/LDHs)n UTF comprising neutral polymer molecules PCDTBT
and CN-PPV within LDH interlayers was constructed via the layer-by-layer
assembly method. The (PCDTBT@CN-PPV/LDHs)n UTFs exhibited broad-band UV–vis absorption, from 400 to
650 nm. The fluorescence emission of the (PCDTBT@CN-PPV/LDHs)n UTFs was quenched, which was the essential
requirement for the PCT process. The photocurrent of the co-assembled
photodetector was highly improved due to the 2D confined effect of
the LDH layers, which was favorable for the PCT and carrier-transport
processes. As a novel photodetector, (PCDTBT@CN-PPV/LDHs)20 UTFs exhibited a high on/off switching ratio, excellent photoresponse
sensitivity, a short recovery time, and outstanding wavelength and
light-intensity dependences both on rigid and flexible substrates.
The excellent photocurrent stability and durability of the co-assembled
UTFs were attributed to the effective 2D confined effect and anti-UV
properties of Mg2Al-LDH nanosheets, which constructed a
nanoscaled space for the formation of the 2D PCDTBT/CN-PPV bulk heterojunction,
facilitating the PCT process and charge transport. All of these
were highly appreciated for high-frequency and high-speed photodetectors
in practical applications. Further exploration concerning other 2D
confined electron donor and acceptor photoelectronic devices is in
progress.
