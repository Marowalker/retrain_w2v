We
report a new Suzuki cross-coupling protocol for high yielding
derivatization of [2.2]paracyclophane with pyridyl and pyrimidyl substituents.
The [2.2]paracyclophane trifluoroborate salt presented herein is a
bench stable, easily accessible, and convenient substitute to former
cross-coupling substrates. This will be of very high interest for
future paracyclophane derivatization endeavors.

Introduction
Although it was discovered
more than 50 years ago,1 [2.2]paracyclophane
continues to receive attention and
is subjected to numerous investigations. Recent advances include multimetallic
complexes,2 N-heterocyclic carbine (NHC)
complexes for enantioselective metal-free silylation,3 and optically active planar-chiral phenylethene dimers.4 Because of its electronic and structural peculiarities,
the chemistry of [2.2]paracyclophane is considerably more cumbersome
than that of the benzene analogue.5 Thus,
its functionalization remains challenging and often requires a special
effort. One of the various uses of [2.2]paracyclophane is that it
is used as a rigid and planar-chiral building block. Especially, its
application as the bridging backbone for multimetallic complexes with
defined metal–metal distances has caught our interest. To furnish
metal-binding sites consisting of ligating heteroaromatics,2 functionalization can either be done de novo
or, more conveniently, by cross-coupling reactions. To this end, our
group reported on the modular derivatization of [2.2]paracyclophane
via the Stille, Suzuki, Kumada, and Negishi cross-coupling reactions.6 However, as found earlier by Canturk et al.,7 Suzuki cross-coupling reactions with boronic
acid equivalent located on the paracyclophane moiety bear some difficulties.

Because the free boronic acid of [2.2]paracyclophane is unstable,
other boron derivatives have to be used. Boronic esters, however,
are either unstable (methyl ester) or do not readily undergo the cross-coupling
reaction (pinacol ester). To our knowledge, trifluoroborates as boronic
acid precursors have never been considered in [2.2]paracyclophane
chemistry. Because organotrifluoroborates hydrolyze under basic and
acidic aqueous conditions,8 it should be
possible to generate boronic acid in situ and “capture”
it in a one-pot hydrolysis and Suzuki cross-coupling reaction to prevent
it from degrading before conversion can take place.

Results and Discussion
Our first attempt to synthesize trifluoroborate from bromide via
the pinacol boronic ester route did yield the desired compound but
not in satisfying yields. A more direct route was described in the
literature by Genêt et al.9 and
could be applied successfully to 4-bromo[2.2]paracyclophane (1). This one-pot procedure enabled us to synthesize potassium
4-trifluoroborate[2.2]paracyclophane
(2) on a multigram scale, which yields up to 85% (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Potassium
4-Trifluoroborate[2.2]paracyclophane (2)
Trifluoroborate is a free-flowing, crystalline
solid, which can
be handled very conveniently. Moreover, it can be stored under air
on the benchtop without any special precautions for months without
degradation (1H NMR after 3 months unchanged). This stability
makes it stand out in comparison to previous [2.2]paracyclophane coupling
methods, which require fresh or even in situ preparation of the coupling
nucleophile. Another advantage is the catalyst system, which is the
air-stable palladium(II) acetate without the necessity of ligands
or additives. Our initial testing showed that palladium(II) acetate
led to superior yields than other common palladium(II) or palladium(0)
sources.10 Because of solubility issues,
we had to substitute the solvents of choice in the literature (often
methanol or ethanol).11 In earlier studies,
we found benzene to be the best solvent for the Suzuki cross-coupling
of [2.2]paracyclophane trifluoroborates. However, here it could be
substituted by less hazardous toluene with a negligible decrease in
yield (<3%). An optimization process was conducted with 2-bromopyridine,
its boryl derivative being a challenging coupling substrate.12 The initial yield of 27% (Table 1, entry 1) was increased to 42% by changing
the base to cesium carbonate and lowering the temperature to 70 °C
with a reaction time of 24 h (entry 15). The addition of commonly
used phosphine ligands such as SPhos and XPhos led to a decrease in
yield. Also not beneficial were higher temperatures (entry 5) and
longer reaction times (entry 10). The trifluoroborate starting material
undergoes hydrodeboronation13 under cross-coupling
conditions, leading to defunctionalized [2.2]paracyclophane as a side
product. The percentage of the side product is up to 52% in relation
to the used starting material 2 (the most hindered substrate,
entry 7). When using less than 5 mol % of the catalyst, the yields
started to decrease (entries 13 and 14), whereas using more than 5
mol % did not lead to an increase in yield either. With these conditions
in hand, we were able to obtain several pyridyl-and pyrimidyl-substituted
[2.2]paracyclophanes in good to very good yields. Our method is also
suitable for large-scale reactions, as compound 3d was
obtained in a very good yield on a gram scale.

Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a Suzuki cross-coupling protocol
that enables the convenient synthesis of pyridyl- and pyrimidyl-substituted
[2.2]paracyclophanes. To that end, [2.2]paracyclophane is converted
to the respective trifluoroborate salt, which is a convenient and
bench-stable solid. The coupling substrates can be used in their commercially
available bromide form to achieve good to very good yields. We believe
that this cross-coupling procedure will find wide applications for
the derivatization of [2.2]paracyclophane. Investigations toward further
coupling substrates and bistrifluoroborate[2.2]paracyclophanes are
currently underway.

Experimental Section
General Information and
Methods
1H NMR spectra
were recorded on a Bruker AM 400 (400 MHz), a Bruker DRX 500 (500
MHz), or on a Bruker AVANCE 600 (600 MHz) spectrometer. Chemical shifts
are expressed in parts per million (ppm, δ) downfield from tetramethylsilane
(TMS) and are referenced to CHCl3 (7.26 ppm) as the internal
standard. All coupling constants are absolute values, and J values
are expressed in hertz (Hz). The description of signals includes the
following: s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, m =
multiplet, dd = doublet of doublet, ddd = doublet of dd, dt = doublet
of triplet, td = triplet of doublet, bs = broad singlet, and m = multiplet.
The spectra were analyzed according to the first order. 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AM 400 (100 MHz), a Bruker
DRX 500 (125 MHz), or on a Bruker AVANCE 600 (150 MHz) spectrometer.
Chemical shifts are expressed in parts per million (ppm, δ)
downfield from TMS and are referenced to CDCl3 (77.0 ppm)
as the internal standard. The signals for 1H were assigned
by the multiplets and those for 13C by distortionless enhancement
by polarization transfer (DEPT)-90 and DEPT-135 spectra and by obvious
chemical shifts. The multiplicity of 13C NMR signals is
given as follows: DEPT: + = primary or tertiary (positive DEPT signal),
– = secondary (negative DEPT signal), Cq = quaternary
C atoms (no DEPT signal). The spectra were analyzed according to the
first order. Mass spectrometry (MS) (electron impact, EI) and MS (fast
atom bombardment, FAB): Finnigan MAT 90 (70 eV). The peaks are given
as the mass-to-charge-ratio (m/z). The molecule peak is given as [M]+. For the high-resolution
mass, the following abbreviations were used: calcd = theoretical calculated
mass; found = mass found in analysis. Infrared spectroscopy (IR):
FT-IR Bruker IFS 88 and Bruker Alpha. IR spectra of solids were recorded
in KBr or by the attenuated total reflection (ATR) technique and as
thin films on KBr for oils and liquids. The deposit of the absorption
band was given in wavenumbers ν̃ in cm–1 between 3600 and 500 cm–1. Band intensities were
characterized as follows: versus = very strong [0–10% transmission
(T)], s = strong (11–30% T), m = medium (31–70% T),
w = weak (71–90% T), and vw = very weak (91–100% T).
Routine monitoring of reactions was performed using silica gel-coated
aluminum plates (Merck, silica gel 60, F254), which were analyzed
under UV light at 254 nm. Solvent mixtures are understood as volume/volume.
Solid materials were powdered. Solvents, reagents, and chemicals were
purchased from Aldrich, Fluka, Carbolution, ChemPur, ABCR, TCI, and
Fisher Scientific. Tetrahydrofuran was distilled from sodium/benzophenone
under argon prior to use. All reactions involving moisture-sensitive
reactants were executed under an argon atmosphere using oven-dried
and/or flame-dried glassware. All other solvents, reagents, and chemicals
were used as purchased unless stated otherwise. Air- or moisture-sensitive
reactions were carried out under an argon atmosphere in previously
evacuated and heated glassware. Liquids were transferred with plastic
syringes and steel cannulas. Solids were used as powders. The reaction
control was performed by thin-layer chromatography. Solvents were
removed at 40 °C at the rotavapor. If not stated otherwise, crude
products were purified by flash chromatography with silica gel 60
(0.040 × 0.063 mm, Geduran) (Merck), which was used as the stationary
phase, and solvents of p.a. quality were used as the mobile phase.

Potassium 4-Trifluoroborate[2.2]paracyclophane (2)
In a round-bottom flask under argon, 4-bromo[2.2]paracyclophane
(5.02 g, 17.5 mmol, and 1.00 equiv) was dissolved in 250 mL of anhydrous
tetrahydrofurane. The solution was cooled to −78 °C, and nBuLi (7.70 mL, 2.5 M, 19.3 mmol, and 1.10 equiv) was added
dropwise by a syringe. After 1 h, the yellow solution was quenched
with triisopropylborate (6.1 mL, 26.2 mmol, and 1.50 equiv). The now
colorless solution was allowed to slowly warm to room temperature.
The next day, aqueous potassium hydrogen difluoride (23.3 mL, 4.5
M, 105 mmol, and 6.00 equiv) was added by the syringe, and the mixture
was stirred vigorously for 3 h. After removal of the solvents under
reduced pressure, the white residue was triturated with acetone (2×
room temperature, 2× boiling, and 50 mL each), and the acetone
was removed under reduced pressure subsequently. The white residue
was washed with dichloromethane and diethylether (100 mL each) and
dried in high vaccum to yield a powdery white crystalline solid (4.79
g, 87%).

General Cross-Coupling Procedure (3a–d)
In a vial fitted with a magnetic stirring bar, potassium 4-trifluoroborate[2.2]paracyclophane
(1.25 equiv), cesium carbonate (4.00 equiv), palladium acetate (0.05
equiv), and the respective bromide (1.00 equiv, if solid) were placed.
The vial was evacuated and backfilled with argon three times. After
addition of the solvent (toluene/water 3:1 and 6.00 mL/mmol), the
respective bromide (1.00 equiv, if liquid) was added via a syringe.
The mixture was put into a vial heating block and heated to 80 °C
for 24 h. The reaction was cooled to ambient temperature and quenched
with sat. aq ammonium chloride. After separation of the phases, the
aqueous phase was extracted with dichloromethane (3 × 15 mL).
The organic phases were dried over sodium sulfate, and the solvent
was removed under reduced pressure. The crude product was purified
via column chromatography (silica and cyclohexane/ethyl acetate).
