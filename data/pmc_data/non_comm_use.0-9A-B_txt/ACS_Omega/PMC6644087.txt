The frequency shifts
of donor stretching vibration in X–H···Y
(X = C, N, O; Y = N, O) hydrogen-bonded complexes of phenylacetylene,
indole, and phenol are linearly correlated with the electrostatic
component of the interaction energy. This linear correlation suggests
that the electrostatic component, which is the first-order perturbative
correction to the stabilization energy, is essentially localized on
the X–H group. The linear correlation suggests that the electrostatic
tuning rate, which is a measure of the X–H oscillator to undergo
shifts upon hydrogen bonding per unit increase in the electrostatic
component of the stabilization energy, was found to be in the order
of O–H > N–H > C–H. Interestingly, for
each of
the donor groups, viz., C–H, N–H, and O–H, the
vibrational frequency shifts were inversely correlated to the dipole
moment of the acceptor separately, which is counterintuitive vis-à-vis
the electrostatic component. This implies that extrapolation to zero
dipole moment of the acceptor will yield very large shifts in the
hydrogen-bonded X–H stretching frequencies. The trends in the
variation of the dispersion and exchange-repulsion components and
the total interaction energy vis-à-vis frequency shifts of
donor stretching vibration are similar for hydrogen-bonded complexes
of phenylacetylene, indole, and phenol. Furthermore, it was observed
that the vibrational frequency shifts of all of the complexes are
linearly correlated with the charge transfer from the filled orbital
of the hydrogen acceptor to the vacant antibonding (σ*) orbital
of the X–H donor group on the basis of natural bonding orbital
calculations.

Introduction
Hydrogen
bonding is one of the most important and ubiquitous noncovalent
interactions due its strength and directionality.1−4 Hydrogen bonding involving O–H
and N–H groups is common and very prevalent.5−7 The hydrogen
bonds involving C–H groups have also been reported in the literature
and are also known to influence crystal structures.8−12 Vibrational spectroscopy has been extensively used
to probe the donor stretching frequency in the hydrogen-bonded systems,13−16 mainly due to the fact that the donor being directly involved in
the hydrogen bond formation is very susceptible to the nature of hydrogen
bonding. The vibrational frequency shift in the donor is a measure
of hydrogen bond energy and depends on the molecular properties of
the hydrogen donor and acceptor.17 In general,
hydrogen bonding leads to a red shift in the donor vibrational frequency;
however, examples of hydrogen-bonded complexes wherein the donor stretching
frequency shifted to blue have also been reported.18−24 Very early work on hydrogen bonding has led to the formulation of
the Badger–Bauer rule, according to which the red shifts in
hydrogen donor vibrational frequencies linearly correlate with their
enthalpy of formation. Furthermore, several examples of correlation
between the red shifts in the donor stretching frequencies and various
properties of the donor and/or acceptor have also been reported.25−29

The IUPAC definition of a hydrogen bond suggests that it is
an
attractive interaction between an X–H group and a suitable
acceptor, wherein X is more electronegative than H.3 High-level quantum chemical calculations have established
that various interaction energy components, such as electrostatics,
polarization, dispersion, charge transfer, and exchange repulsion,
contribute to the overall stabilization energy.30−34 The relative contributions from each energy component
vary widely depending on the nature of hydrogen bond donor–acceptor
characteristics. In recent years, efforts are being made to determine
the origin of vibrational frequency shifts in the donor stretching
vibrations. Our group had earlier shown that the red shifts in the
acetylenic C–H stretching vibration of C–H···X
(X = O, N) hydrogen-bonded complexes of 3-fluoro- and 2,6-difluorophenylacetylenes
were linearly correlated with the electrostatic component of stabilization
energy but not the total stabilization energy.35 Moreover, it was also shown that the dispersion energy
component modulates the trends observed in total stabilization energy.35 On the other hand, for a series of ammonia and
methylamine complexes of fluorine-substituted phenylacetylenes (PA),
the shifts in the acetylenic C–H stretching vibration were
linearly correlated with the stabilization energies.36 For a series of O–H···O hydrogen-bonded
water complexes of fluorophenols, based on the correlation between
the shifts in the O–H stretching frequencies and the stabilization
energies, the complexes were categorized into two sets. However, the
energy decomposition analysis (EDA) revealed that the shifts in the
O–H stretching frequencies were linearly correlated with the
electrostatic component of the stabilization energy.37 In this case, the interaction energies were decomposed
using the localized molecular orbital energy decomposition analysis
(LMO-EDA) method.37 In some cases, the
red shift in the donor stretching frequencies was correlated with
the exchange-repulsion term,38 which was
obtained by the symmetry-adapted perturbation theory39 in combination with the density functional theory (DFT-SAPT).
Hobza and co-workers have recently shown one-to-one correspondence
between DFT-SAPT and the canonical EDA method.39 Lane et al. have investigated the hydrogen bonding interactions
in a series of 15 different complexes of OH donor groups with various
acceptor atoms, which exhibit a strong correlation between the red
shifts in the O–H stretching frequency and the kinetic energy
density integrated within the reduced density gradient volume with s = 0.5 au, irrespective of the atom type of the hydrogen
bond acceptor.40

In the present work,
we seek to address a simple question, whether
or not the shifts in the X–H stretching frequencies of various
donor groups, such as C–H, N–H, and O–H, in their
hydrogen-bonded complexes are governed only by the electrostatic component
and not by the total stabilization energy, irrespective of their inherent
polarity. To this end, investigations on X–H···Y
(X = C, N, O) hydrogen-bonded complexes of phenylacetylene (PA), indole
(IN), and phenol (PH), respectively, with various Lewis bases (see Scheme 1) such as water,
methanol, etc. were carried out using experimentally guided ab initio
calculations, and the results are presented in this article.

Results and Discussion
The structures of several linear X–H···Y
(X = C, N, O; Y = N, O) hydrogen-bonded complexes of phenylacetylene,
indole, and phenol were optimized at the MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ level of
theory. The structural parameters (bond lengths and angles) for all
of the hydrogen-bonded complexes are given in Table S1 (see the Supporting Information). The zero point
energy (ZPE)- and basis set superposition error (BSSE)-corrected stabilization
energies calculated at the MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ level and the calculated
donor (X–H) stretching frequencies along with their shifts
relative to the corresponding monomer are listed in Table 1. The stabilization energies
for the X–H···Y hydrogen-bonded complexes of
phenylacetylene and phenol complexes were calculated at various levels
of theory including the CCSD(T)/CBS level and are listed in Table S2 (see the Supporting Information). The
CCSD(T)/CBS interaction energies were not calculated for indole complexes
because of paucity of computational resources.

It is well known that
hydrogen bonding leads to red shifts in X–H
stretching frequencies accompanied by an increase in the anharmonicity
in the potential energy function of the donor X–H groups. The
increase in anharmonicity with the basicity of the hydrogen bond acceptor
eventually leads to double-well potential along the proton-transfer
reaction coordinate. To estimate the role of hydrogen bonding in anharmonicity
of the X–H bond, anharmonic calculations were carried out using
second-order vibrational perturbation theory (VPT2) at the B3LYP-D3/aug-cc-pVDZ
level,41,42 for the phenylacetylene,43,44 indole,45,46 and phenol47,48 complexes
for which the experimental X–H stretching frequencies are reported
in the literature and are listed in Table S3. To evaluate the performance of the anharmonic calculations, the
calculated harmonic and anharmonic frequencies were plotted against
the experimental frequencies (shown in Figure S1; Supporting information). Figure S1 suggests that even the calculated anharmonic frequencies have to
be scaled to match the experimental values, which is in accord with
the earlier reports.41,42 On the other hand, Figure S2 (see the Supporting Information) shows
the correlation between experimental and harmonic frequencies calculated
at the MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ level. It can be observed from Figures S1 and S2 that the quality of fits is
much better for the harmonic calculations. Therefore, it can be inferred
that scaling of harmonic frequencies is a better approach to anharmonicity
at least for the present set of calculations. Based on these results,
the calculated frequencies at the MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ level were scaled
with 0.852, and to the resulting frequencies, 404.9 cm–1 was added to obtain the final calculated frequencies, which are
listed in Table 1,
and were used for further analysis. Table 1 lists experimentally observed X–H
stretching frequency shifts, wherever available, which enables comparison
with the corresponding calculated values.

It has been reported
that for the phenol complexes the red shifts
in the O–H stretching frequencies were correlated with the
proton affinity of the acceptor.14Figure 1 shows the plot of
shifts in the X–H stretching frequencies against the corresponding
X–H covalent bond distance, which shows a linear correlation,
suggesting that the vibrational frequency shifts due to hydrogen bonding
are a measure of bond elongation. Furthermore, Figure 1 also shows the plot of shifts in the X–H
stretching frequencies against the proton affinities of the acceptors
(see Table S4), and in all of the three
cases, the data could be fitted to a second-order polynomial. A comparison
with the linear fits for the same set of data is shown in Figure S3 (see the Supporting Information), which
clearly suggests a nonlinear correlation between the X–H stretching
frequency shifts and the proton affinity of the acceptor and the influence
of the second-order effects with the increase in the shifts. This
is in contrast to several other examples of hydrogen-bonded systems
reported in the literature wherein the shifts in the donor stretching
frequencies are linearly correlated to the proton affinity of the
acceptor.14,15,35,38,50 On the other hand,
Pines et al.49 suggested the possibility
of nonlinear correlation between the X–H stretching frequency
shifts in the hydrogen-bonded complexes and proton affinities, especially
for the stronger bases, which is related to an increase in the anharmonicity
and indicates the eventuality of formation of double-well potential
along the proton-transfer reaction coordinate.49,50

one data point corresponding to the phenylacetylene–trimethylamine
complex has been omitted from the fitting (encircled). (B) Plot of

least-squares fits to a second-degree polynomial with R2 values of 0.961 (for phenylacetylene complexes), 0.953
(for indole complexes), and 0.989 (for phenol complexes). The data
points in (B) correspond to complexes with water (691.1), methanol
(754.3), ethanol (776.4), dimethylether (792.0), diethylether (828.4),
ammonia (853.6), methylamine (899.0), dimethylamine (929.5), and trimethylamine
(948.9) as acceptors with an increase in proton affinity values in
kJ mol–1.68

It was earlier reported, by our group, for a series
of C–H···X
(X = O, N) hydrogen-bonded complexes of 3-fluoro- and 2,6-difluorophenylacetylene,
that the red shifts in the C–H stretching frequencies were
linearly correlated with the electrostatic component of the interaction
energy but not with the overall stabilization energies of the complexes.35 Therefore, to probe the role of various energy
components in the shifts in X–H stretching frequencies for
all of the three sets of complexes (viz., phenylacetylene, indole,
and phenol), energy decomposition analysis was carried out using the
SAPT2 method, and the results are presented in Table 2. The BSSE- and ZPE-corrected CCSD(T)/CBS
stabilization energies and the ZPE-corrected SAPT2 interaction energies
for the phenylacetylene and the phenol complexes are presented in Tables 1 and S2. It is observed that these two sets of energies
are in excellent agreement with each other and show a maximum deviation
of within ±1.3 kJ mol–1 with a standard deviation
of 0.75 kJ mol–1. Figure 2 shows the plot of shifts in the X–H
stretching frequencies for all of the three sets of complexes against
the ZPE-corrected SAPT2 interaction energies, which clearly suggests
that these two parameters are not correlated (also see Figure S4; Supporting Information). The lack
of correlation between X–H frequency shifts and the SAPT2 interaction
energies signifies that the Badger–Bauer rule is not valid
for the linear X–H···Y hydrogen-bonded complexes
of phenylacetylene, indole, and phenol with different bases, even
though the hydrogen bonding abilities of C–H, N–H, and
O–H groups are relatively different. It must be pointed out
that a general trend of the overall increase in the stabilization
energies from water complexes to trimethylamine complexes is observed.
Furthermore, Figure 2 also shows the plot of shifts in the X–H stretching frequencies
against the electrostatic and dispersion components of the interaction
energy. Figures S5–S7 (see the Supporting
Information) show plots of shifts in the X–H stretching frequencies
against various energy components of SAPT analysis. A linear correlation
between the X–H stretching frequency shifts and the (i) electrostatic
component, (ii) induction component, and (iii) sum of electrostatic,
induction, and charge-transfer components was observed in all of the
three cases. In SAPT, the electrostatic and induction components correspond
to the first- and second-order perturbative correction to the total
interaction energy.51 The observed linear
correlation between the X–H stretching frequency shifts and
the electrostatic component as well as the induction component suggests
that these perturbative corrections are essentially localized on the
X–H group. On the other hand, all of the other energy components
show modulation in the frequency shifts. It can be inferred from the
plots shown in Figure 2 that the electrostatic component of the interaction energy is responsible
for the X–H frequency shifts in the hydrogen-bonded complexes
irrespective of the identity of the hydrogen bond donor. Based on
the comparison of plots of the X–H stretching frequencies against
various components of SAPT2 interaction energy (Figures 2 and S5–S7, see the Supporting Information), it can be inferred that dispersion
and exchange-repulsion components are better indicators of the stabilization
energy trends vis-à-vis vibrational frequency shifts in hydrogen-bonded
complexes.52 The dispersion and exchange-repulsion
terms in SAPT do not have any classical analogues and are governed
by the electron correlation between the monomers and the overlap of
wave functions of the two monomers, respectively.51 Evidently, these two components depend on the nature of
the interacting molecules and thus regulate the total stabilization
energy.52

The experimental dipole moments and
calculated polarizabilities
for the various hydrogen bond acceptors are given in Table S4 (see the Supporting Information). Figure 3 depicts the plots of shifts
in the X–H stretching frequencies against the dipole moment
of the acceptor for the three sets of donors. Surprisingly, for all
of the three donors, viz., C–H, N–H, and O–H
groups considered in this study, the shifts in X–H (X = C,
N, and O) stretching frequencies decease with the increase in the
dipole moment of the acceptor, separately. A linear correlation with
negative slope was observed between the X–H stretching frequency
shifts and the dipole moments of the acceptor. It must be pointed
out here that in all of the three cases the data points corresponding
to hydrogen-bonded complexes with ethers (both dimethyl and diethyl
ethers) were found to be outliers, even though they follow the general
trend, i.e., dimethylether with a higher dipole moment shows a smaller
frequency shift. The linear fits with all of the data points including
those corresponding to dimethyl and diethyl ethers, shown in Figure S8 (see the Supporting Information), also
suggest a general linear trend but with relatively lower quality fits.
The deviation of the ethers from the linear correlation can be attributed
to relative orientation of the eithers vis-à-vis other complexes
because of geometry constraints (steric effects). In these two cases,
the dipole of the acceptor and the X–H bond are not in the
same plane, which is in contrast to all of the other cases, thereby
leading to suboptimal shifts. The linear correlations in Figure 3 appear to be counterintuitive
given that the shifts in the hydrogen-bonded X–H stretching
frequencies are linearly correlated with the electrostatic component
of the total stabilization energy, as can be seen in Figure 2. The dipole moment, which
is an indicator of charge separation, in a classical sense, does not
favor the hydrogen bond formation. It is interesting to note that
extrapolation of these fits to zero dipole moment yields very large
shifts in the hydrogen-bonded X–H stretching vibrations. It
can therefore be inferred that if the charge distribution of the lone
pair of electrons, which act as hydrogen bond acceptors, is compensated
by the charge distribution from the rest of the molecule it would
lead to the formation of strongest hydrogen-bonded complexes. It is
important to emphasize that the electrostatic component in SAPT corresponds
to the first-order perturbation correction to the interaction energy
of the complex. The observed inverse correlation between the acceptor
dipole moment and the frequency shifts vis-a-vis the linear correlation
between the electrostatic component and the frequency shifts suggests
that the increased dipole moment of the acceptor molecule results
in lower first-order correction to the stabilization energy of the
complexes. Furthermore, this also suggests that the trends in the
quantum and classical descriptions are opposing.

to dimethyl and diethyl ethers were omitted from the linear fits.
In (B), (D), and (F), dashed lines are the trend lines and the solid
lines are separate linear least-squares fits to X–H···O
and X–H···N complexes.

Figure 3 also
shows
the plots of shifts in the X–H stretching frequencies against
the calculated polarizability of the acceptors, which show clear modulation
in the trend (dashed line). However, the shifts for the X–H···O
and X–H···N hydrogen-bonded complexes show linear
correlation separately. A comparison of Figures 2 and 3 suggests that
the electrostatic component of the stabilization energy is a better
physical parameter to understand the X–H frequency shifts,
as it is independent of geometry constraints and nature of the acceptor.

The natural bonding orbital (NBO)53 theory
suggests that charge transfer between the hydrogen acceptor and donor
plays a crucial role in hydrogen bonding complexes. Using NBO calculations
at the MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ level of theory, the magnitude of charge transfer
from the filled orbital of the hydrogen acceptor to the vacant antibonding
(σ*) orbital of the donor group (X–H) and the population
changes in the σ*(X–H) orbitals due to the hyperconjugative
charge transfer for various X–H···Y (X = C,
N, and O; Y = O and N) hydrogen-bonded complexes of phenylacetylene,
indole, and phenol were evaluated, and their values are listed in Table S5 (see the Supporting Information). Figure 4 shows the plots
for the shifts in the X–H stretching frequencies for all of
the three types of donors considered in the present investigation
against (A) charge transfer to the vacant antibonding (σ*) orbital
of the donor group (X–H) and (B) population changes in the
σ*(X–H) orbitals. It is clearly evident from plots Figure 4 A,B that the frequency
shifts are linearly correlated with both the charge transfer and the
population changes occurred during the hydrogen bond formation. Moreover,
the data from all of the three sets of complexes have shown a single
correlation, suggesting that NBO parameters are better descriptors
for the vibrational frequency shifts. It must be pointed out that
the plots of frequency shifts for each of the three sets of complexes
against the charge-transfer component calculated using SAPT do not
show any trend (see panel C of Figures S5–S7; Supporting Information), which is completely in contrast to the
linear correlation observed in NBO (see panel A of Figure 4). The discrepancy arises due
to different treatment of charge-transfer components in SAPT and NBO.54−57

Figure 4 Plots
of shift in the hydrogen-bonded X–H (X = C, N, O)
stretching frequencies against the (A) charge transfer from the filled
orbital of the hydrogen acceptor to the vacant antibonding (σ*)
orbital of the X–H donor group, (B) population difference in
the antibonding (σ*) orbital of the X–H donor group due
to the hyperconjugative charge transfer, (C) electron density at the
bond critical point, and (D) kinetic energy density at the bond critical
point. In (A) and (B), the straight lines are linear least-squares
fits to all of the data points with R2 values of 0.955 and 0.976, respectively. In (C) and (D), the straight
lines are separate fits to X–H···O (R2 values of 0.951 and 0.936) and X–H···N
(R2 values of 0.981 and 0.978) hydrogen-bonded
complexes.

Furthermore, topological parameters
were calculated using the atoms-in-molecules
(AIM) theory for all of the complexes and are listed in Table S6 (see the Supporting Information). Figure 4 also shows the plots
of shifts in the X–H stretching frequencies for all of the
three types of donors against the electron density (Figure 4C) and kinetic energy density
(Figure 4D) at bond
critical point along the intermolecular axis. In these two plots,
a separate correlation for the X–H···O and X–H···N
(X = C, N, and O) hydrogen bonds was observed. These results suggest
that the topological parameters are dependent on the type of acceptor
atom (O vs N), unlike NBO parameters.

Figure 2 shows that
the shift in the X–H stretching fundamentals due to hydrogen
bonding is linearly correlated to the electrostatic component of the
stabilization energy (Eelec) and has the
functional form given by eq 1 1  Thus, Eelec effectively
captures the changes in the potential energy function of the X–H
oscillator because of the formation of hydrogen bonds. Furthermore,
γ can be termed as the electrostatic tuning rate with units
of cm–1 (kJ mol–1)−1, akin to the stark tuning rate,58,59 which describes
the sensitivity of the X–H oscillator to undergo shifts upon
hydrogen bonding per unit increase in the electrostatic component
of the stabilization energy. The linear correlations in Figure 2 result in electrostatic tuning
rates of 8.3, 9.6, and 10.5 cm–1 (kJ mol–1)−1 for the hydrogen-bonded complexes of phenylacetylene,
indole, and phenol, respectively, indicating that the O–H oscillator
is more sensitive to changes in the electrostatic component followed
by N–H and C–H oscillators. Furthermore, in the case
of zero-shifting hydrogen bond, wherein ΔνHB = 0, the corresponding electrostatic component of the stabilization
energy, Eelec0 = κ/γ, can be termed as critical
electrostatic energy and κ can be termed as the stopping frequency.
Thus, it can be inferred that if Eelec > Eelec0 it will lead to red shifts, whereas Eelec < Eelec0 will lead to blue shifts.
One of the artifacts of the linear fitting is that the zero electrostatic
component will lead to a blue shift equivalent to κ, which is
physically absurd. This essentially implies that interpretation should
be carried out with utmost care on the basis of an appropriate physical
model and a single correlation may not work for the entire range.
Similar physical models can be built for all of the linear correlations
observed for the frequency shifts against dipole moment. On the other
hand, in the case of nonlinear correlation as observed in the plot
of frequency shifts against proton affinities of the acceptors 2  In
the fitting function, the parameters a, b1, and b2 in eq 2 are mathematical constructs and
may not have any physical meaning,
as is the present scenario, but capture the behavior of change in
the potential energy function. This fitting function shows only the
nonlinear dependence on the independent parameter plotted on abscissa.
However, if the initial portion of the curve is fitted to a straight
line, then the x-intercept can be interpreted as
the value of the proton affinity that will produce zero shift.

Conclusions
Several linear X–H···Y (X = C, N, and O;
Y = O, N) hydrogen-bonded complexes of phenylacetylene, indole, and
phenol were analyzed with various interacting bases using ab initio
calculations, and the following inferences can be made:The stabilization energies are in
the order phenol >
indole > phenylacetylene, which can be attributed to the hydrogen
bonding ability of the donor (O–H > N–H > C–H).

The SAPT2/cc-pVTZ energy decomposition analysis
shows
that for all of the three sets of complexes the observed red shifts
in the X–H stretching frequencies are linearly correlated with
the electrostatic component of stabilization energy, whereas the dispersion
and exchange-repulsion component plots follow the trend similar to
that of the total stabilization energy, irrespective of the hydrogen
bonding ability of the donor.

The linear
correlation between the electrostatic component
and the X–H frequency shifts suggests that the first-order
perturbative correction to the total energy is essentially localized
on the X–H group.

The shifts in
X–H stretching frequencies for
C–H, N–H, and O–H donor groups in each case were
inversely correlated to the dipole moments of the acceptor, which
indicates that the larger the dipole moment, the lower is its ability
to perturb the X–H oscillator.



Computational
Methodology
The details of the computational methodology
adopted for the present
work are given in the Supporting Information. Briefly, geometry optimization was followed by vibrational frequency
calculations of hydrogen-bonded complexes using the MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ
level of theory and the stabilization energies were calculated incorporating
ZPE and BSSE corrections. Furthermore, anharmonic vibrational frequencies
were also calculated for selected complexes using the B3LYP-D3/aug-cc-pVDZ
level following geometry optimization at the same level of theory.60 Furthermore, single-point energies calculations
were carried out at the at MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ and CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVDZ
levels. Energies at MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ and MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ levels were
extrapolated to estimate MP2/CBS energies using the extrapolation
scheme given by Helgaker and co-workers,61 wherein the electron correlation error is on the order of N–3 for the aVNZ basis set.62,63 The CCSD(T)/CBS energies were estimated on the basis of the fact
that the difference in stabilization energies between MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ
and MP2/CBS levels is similar to that between CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVDZ
and CCSD(T)/CBS levels. Furthermore, the energy decomposition analysis
of all of the hydrogen-bonded complexes considered in the present
study was also carried out using second-order symmetry-adapted perturbation
theory (SAPT2).64 The geometry optimization
and vibrational frequency calculations were carried out using the
Gaussian 1665 suite of programs with the
graphical interface GaussView 5.66 Anharmonic
vibrational frequencies were calculated using the second-order vibrational
perturbation theory (VPT2) implemented in Gaussian 16.65 The SAPT calculations were performed using the
PSI4 program.67
