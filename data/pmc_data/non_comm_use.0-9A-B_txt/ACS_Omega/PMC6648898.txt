This
study presents preliminary experimental data suggesting that
sodium 4-(pyrene-1-yl)butane-1-sulfonate (PBSA), 5, an
analogue of sodium pyrene-1-sulfonate (PSA), 1, enhances
the stability of aqueous reduced graphene oxide (RGO) graphene dispersions.
We find that RGO and exfoliated graphene dispersions prepared in the
presence of 5 are approximately double the concentration
of those made with commercially available PSA, 1. Quantum
mechanical and molecular dynamics simulations provide key insights
into the behavior of these molecules on the graphene surface. The
seemingly obvious introduction of a polar sulfonate head group linked
via an appropriate alkyl spacer to the aromatic core results in both
more efficient binding of 5 to the graphene surface and
more efficient solvation of the polar head group by bulk solvent (water).
Overall, this improves the stabilization of the graphene flakes by
disfavoring dissociation of the stabilizer from the graphene surface
and inhibiting reaggregation by electrostatic and steric repulsion.
These insights are currently the subject of further investigations
in an attempt to develop a rational approach to the design of more
effective dispersing agents for rGO and graphene in aqueous solution.

1 Introduction
It
is now a truism that the isolation of graphene in 2004 has had
an immeasurable effect upon materials science,1,2 although
a major hurdle, yet to be surmounted, is the development of scalable
methods for its production. The most frequently employed preparation
of graphene utilizes a “top-down” approach, which involves
the direct exfoliation of bulk graphite into graphene flakes.3−7 This can be achieved with the aid of mechanical forces8,9 using sonication or shear mixing10 in
the liquid phase in order to overcome the strongly attractive interlayer
van der Waals forces. More recently, the application of ball-milling11 and electrochemical12 techniques to graphene exfoliation has been expounded by a number
of workers. The exfoliated graphene (EG) produced by these methods
has properties that closely resemble “pristine” graphene,
but there tends to be a mix of both single- and few-layer flakes in
dispersion. In a slightly different approach, graphite is first oxidized,
by one of a number of reagents, to graphite oxide, which then experiences
interlayer expansion making graphite oxide more prone to solution-phase
exfoliation, resulting in the production of high yields of graphene
oxide (GO) monolayers.13 The GO produced
in such processes is a highly defective, insulating, two-dimensional
(2D) material that disperses into polar solvents. The chemical or
thermal reduction of the oxygen-containing functionality groups introduced
in this exfoliation process reforms the lattice of sp2-hybridized
carbons, giving reduced GO (rGO) which has properties similar, but
not identical, to that of “pristine” graphene.

The exact choice of a graphene material and processing conditions
will ultimately depend on the final application to which the material
is used, which dictates the specific properties that are required.
Ideally, scalable production and processing requires stable, high-concentration
dispersions, and in this regard, it has been shown that careful control
of the surface tension and Hansen solubility parameters is crucial
to finding a good solvent for graphene stability in solution.14 Typically, the use of solvents such as N-methylpyrrolidin-2-one, N,N-dimethylformamide, or ortho-dichlorobenzene has
found favor in the direct exfoliation of graphite because of their
ability to produce stable dispersions of EG and rGO. Unfortunately,
the toxicity and high boiling points of these solvents will affect
their acceptance in mass production and processing, whereas the use
of environmentally benign solvents, such as water, is hampered by
the generation of dispersions of low stability because of high surface
tension and mismatched solubility parameters.15,16

The use of surfactants, polymers, and small organic molecules
has
also been investigated for exfoliation in aqueous media.17−30 Unfortunately, any analysis of the compounds previously utilized
for the stabilization of aqueous dispersions of rGO and EG is confused
by the fact that these agents have been chosen on an empirical basis
and include a broad range of structural motifs, which possess a diverse
variety of functional groups. Many studies in this area have been,
by necessity, driven pragmatically and frequently relied upon the
use of commercially accessible materials, which were found to have
stabilizing properties.25−30 In the context of the present study, it is of interest to note therefore
that Mohamed et al. (2016)31 recently remarked
that advances (in the optimization of the exfoliation
process) have been hampered by a lack of reliable predictive
models for designing graphene-philic molecules because studies have
been restricted to dispersing graphene using commercially available
surfactants and many of the stabilizers described in the
literature may not therefore provide the optimal dispersion performance.32 The evolution of a rational design process,
more akin to that used in drug discovery, for the identification of
more efficient exfoliants for 2D materials is problematical, as noted
by Olivier and Samorì (2016),33 because a full understanding of the dispersion-stabilizing agent (DSA) role,
needed for identifying the best DSAs to enhance the liquid-phase exfoliation
(LPE) process, is still lacking. This assessment was again
recently echoed by Zhang et al. (2017)34 when probing the use of 4-(pyrene-1-yl)butanoic acid (PBA), a commonly
used intermediate35,36 for the noncovalent functionalization
of graphene, who concluded that the nature of (the PBA) binding
on graphene is poorly understood. Indeed, the current state
of the art has been most succinctly summarized by Coleman37 who notes that only a few systematic
studies exist on the impact of the chemical structure of the surfactant
on the degree of exfoliation and especially nanosheet size with little
empirical data available apart from the most commonly used surfactants. In conclusion, there are only limited reports on noncovalently
stabilized aqueous graphene dispersions in the simulation literature,38 and little work has been done on either the
rationalization of stabilizer efficiency or the generation of a predictive
model for the design of new stabilizers.39 In this paper, we wish to present our initial findings concerning
the development of a rational approach to the design and synthesis
of aqueous graphene dispersing agents.

Any assessment of the
exfoliation efficiency of a new stabilizer
is complicated by the lack of standard experimental protocols for
the exfoliation process itself and the use of poorly defined analytical
regimens for determining the concentration of the exfoliated material.40 Overall, these factors render it difficult to
generate meaningful comparisons between newly engineered stabilizers
with those previously reported in the literature. That said, it is
possible to make a number of gross generalizations concerning the
structural features that are common to existing exfoliants/stabilizers,
as embodied in the structures depicted in Figure 1, which has enabled the definition of a design
strategy for the synthesis of more efficient stabilizing agents. Structural
features that are common to many exfoliating agents that are reported
in the literature include the following:The presence of a hydrophobic domain, oftentimes a polycyclic
aromatic system, which is capable of entering into stabilizing π–π
interactions with the exfoliated material;

The incorporation of reduced hydrocarbon fragments,
such as those in a steroid nucleus or core structures decorated with
long-chain hydrocarbon substructures, which may interact with the
graphene surface via van der Waals forces;

The presence of one or more polar/charged residues which
disfavor aggregation of the exfoliated material because of unfavorable
electrostatic and/or steric interactions. These polar functional groups
(typically sulfonic acid salts, phenols, or ammonium salts) may also
infer the solubility of the exfoliated material in polar solvents
such as water.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Molecular
Design
The current research
in this area reveals a central dichotomy: the direct exfoliation of
graphite, which is well-suited to scale-up, is generally low yielding
and produces a material with a lateral flake size of <1 μm
because of the lack of control over cleavage and scission of graphite
during sonication or shear mixing. The preparation of GO and rGO on
the other hand results in the isolation of material possessing many
defects because of the strong oxidation conditions during synthesis,
although near quantitative conversions have been reported for these
processes and lateral sizes of >100 μm are reported for GO.2a The reduction of GO to rGO is often carried
out to restore graphitic properties to the material, be that electrical
conductivity or superior mechanical properties for reinforcement in
composites,2b or in the preparation of
printable supercapacitors2c and solar cells,2d applications in which the control lateral flake
size is particularly critical.

In this study, we sought to identify
new stabilizers for the preparation of rGO and graphene flakes where
structural and electronic features in the stabilizer could be modified
in a systematic fashion, enabling a correlation between the structure
and dispersion efficiency. In addition, this synthetic program would
be supported by a theoretical study in which the structure-exfoliating
efficiency could be probed in silico with a view to the development
of a predictive model for the design of more efficient stabilizers.
The starting point for our investigation was based upon the seminal
investigation of Chen and Li25,42 who first noted that
sodium pyrene-1-sulfonate (PSA), 1, was able to stabilize
aqueous dispersions of graphene. Subsequent investigations by Green,22 Feng and Müllen,43 He,44 and then Mullen and Casiraghi45 provided further justification for the adoption
of this and related substrates (e.g.,1-pyrenecarboxylic acid30) as graphene dispersing agents. Subsequent investigations
by Casiraghi, Beljonne, and Palermo have also provided a theoretical
understanding of the interaction between commercially available stabilizers
such as PSA with graphene.46 From these
studies, it is now generally accepted that PSA which possesses an
aromatic core (ca. 120 Å2) participates in stabilizing
π–π interactions with the rGO and EG surface, and
the polar, ionized, sulfonic acid head group (ArSO3⊖)
enables both solvation by the bulk solvent (water) and the creation
of a negatively charged adduct-flake surface, which results in electrostatic
repulsion between flakes, thereby inhibiting reaggregation. However,
we questioned whether the attachment of the bulky polar sulfonic acid
residue, directly to the pyrene core, would in fact result in less
than optimal π–π interactions with the graphene
surface and, potentially, a diminution in the degree of solvation
by bulk water because of interactions of this moiety with the graphene
surface.

In keeping with Liu’s observations,39 we
hypothesized (Figure 2) that a simple structural modification to 1, namely,
the introduction of a “spacer” between the polar head
group (RSO3⊖) and the “central core”,
would generate a more efficient exfoliating agent, sodium 4-(pyrene-1-yl)butane-1-sulfonate
(PBSA), on the premise that the conformationally mobile alkyl spacer
would enable the pyrene core to achieve maximum π–π
interactions with the graphene surface as well as permit the polar
sulfonic acid residue to be more exposed to the bulk solvent.46 The introduction of a “spacer group”
(e.g., an n-butyl chain) between the central core
(pyrene) and the polar head group could also provide additional stabilization
of the absorbed substrate by way of hydrophobic interactions. The
choice of PBSA as a starting point for our initial investigations
was, to some extent, a pragmatic decision and guided partly by the
commercial availability of suitably prefunctionalized pyrene derivatives.
Although similar strategies have been applied to the synthesis of
new surfactants for the dispersion of carbon nanotubes,47a−47f a systematic “QSAR”-type approach aimed at the development
of new stabilizers for graphene exfoliation, which has not to our
knowledge been used. In this approach, both the “spacer”
and the electronic/steric properties of the central core could, in
principle, be modified by the introduction of a range of “attenuating
groups”.48 We considered that this
model, in conjunction with relevant theoretical investigations, could
enable the generation of a framework, in which the effect of substituent/core
motifs on exfoliation efficiency could be addressed with the goal
of achieving optimum exfoliation efficiency.

Figure 2 Design concept for the
generation of new graphene stabilizing agents.

2.2 Synthesis
Having decided upon a design
strategy (Figure 2),
we embarked upon the synthesis of PBSA so that its efficiency as a
stabilizing group in comparison with PSA could be determined. The
synthesis of 5(49,50) was accomplished in
a three-step sequence starting from 1-pyrenebutanoic acid, 2, as outlined in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of PBSA
Reduction (BH3·THF; 57%) of 2 to alcohol 3 followed by an Appel reaction51 (PPh3, 1.2 equiv; CBr4, 1.3 equiv; K2CO3, 1.5 equiv; CH2Cl2; 79%) readily
afforded bromide 4. Finally, conversion of bromide 4 into 5 was accomplished by the reaction with
an excess of sodium sulfite52 (12 equiv)
in aqueous ethanol at reflux. Removal of excess sodium sulfite proved
feasible merely by washing the crude product with cold water. Finally,
recrystallization of the triturated material
from aqueous ethanol afforded PBSA in 54% yield; microanalytical and
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) data confirmed that this material
was devoid of excess sulfite and was isolated as the monohydrate (see
Experimental Procedures in the Supporting Information).

2.3 rGO Stabilization: Extinction Coefficient
and Concentration
rGO was used for comparing the stabilization
performance of PSA and PBSA because, in contrast with direct exfoliation
of graphite, where the stabilizing molecule is closely responsible
for the performance of the exfoliation as well as the stabilization
of the EG flakes, this method solely concentrates on the stabilization
of monolayer rGO. Graphite oxide was exfoliated, using a modified
Hummers method,53 to near 100% monolayer
GO in water. By mixing this solution with a stabilizer and reducing
the GO with l-ascorbic acid,54 it was possible to probe the ability of the stabilizer at preventing
reaggregation of the rGO flakes. For comparison, we developed an optimized
general protocol for the preparation of rGO using the commercially
available PSA and novel PBSA as stabilizers whereby both dispersions
were subjected to the same processing conditions (see the Supporting Information). By varying the concentrations
of both GO and the stabilizer molecule, we determined that a weight
ratio of 3:1 PSA/GO (3 mg mL–1 PSA and 1 mg mL–1 GO) was found to give the optimum results for the
commercial stabilizer in this protocol (see rGO/EG Methodology in
the Supporting Information). This equates
to 9.9 mM PSA and 8.3 MM PBSA. It was found that equal molar concentrations
had little effect on the results (see the Supporting Information). It was also found during these preliminary experiments
that sonication during the production process was necessary to produce
dispersions of PSA-stabilized rGO because of partial reaggregation;
therefore, this was included in the optimal processing conditions.

Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirm
the quality of the rGO flakes and that they are sufficiently reduced
to reform the sp2-hybridized network (Supporting Information). The ID/IG ratios of the PSA- and PBSA-stabilized
rGO flakes are 1.43 and 1.51, respectively, which are comparable to
other works, when accounting for a large D′ peak.55 The C/O ratios, gained from peak-fitting the
XPS C 1s spectra of GO and rGO, were 1.94 and 4.55, respectively.
Peak fitting of the high-resolution C 1s spectra shows the return
of a high level of carbon–carbon sp2 bonding after
reduction. By analyzing the lateral flake size by scanning electron
microscopy (SEM), a reduction in lateral flake size is seen when compared
to the GO dispersion, which is consistent with prolonged sonication
and cleaning procedures.56 The flake size
distribution of the two stabilizers is comparable, demonstrating the
robustness of this method. Analysis of atomic force microscopy (AFM)
step height indicates that the majority of the flakes are monolayers,
with no restacking of the flakes, with a thickness of approximately
1.5 nm, which is in agreement with literature values for monolayer
rGO flakes with a monolayer of stabilizer molecules on each surface.57 UV–vis spectroscopy was also employed
in an attempt to quantify the concentration of the dispersed material
and hence provides a measure of the stabilizing effect of 5 relative to 1. It is possible to obtain a measure of
the amount of graphene dispersed in a given sample by measuring the
light attenuated at long wavelengths in the UV–vis spectra
of these dispersions, where the higher concentrations of graphene
result in a greater degree of light absorption.58 By utilizing the absorption at 660 nm and normalizing with
respect to the path length of the cuvette, a value of “Absorption-over-path
length” (“Abs/l”) can be obtained.59 This comparison is only strictly reliable when,
as in this case, the flake size and thickness are uniform throughout
the samples and the light attenuation is only affected by the concentration
and scattering effects are uniform across samples. We determine that
the exfoliation of rGO with PBSA is comparable to the values reported
in the literature for poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate)-stabilized rGO,
where concentrations in the range of 0.1–1 mg mL–1 have been reported.60 Weight concentrations
are estimated to be 0.24 ± 0.07 and 0.60 ± 0.07 mg mL–1 for PSA and PBSA, respectively (Figure 3a), using an extinction coefficient
of 5440 L g–1 m–1 at 660 nm,61 which corresponds to an overall yield of approximately
60% for the PBSA-stabilized rGO. The increase in the concentration
of the exfoliated material observed here may be ascribed to the greater
stabilization proffered by PBSA toward rGO flake reaggregation, a
result which is clearly evident to the naked eye (Figure 3a, inset). This assertion is
supported by zeta potential (ζ) values62 of −33 ± 2 and −40 ± 2 mV for PSA- and PBSA-stabilized
rGO dispersions, respectively. These relative values do support the
notion that PBSA appears to stabilize rGO more effectively than PSA.
Ostensibly, this outcome may be due to a more efficient packing of
PBSA on the surface of rGO when compared to that of PSA, where the
conformationally mobile alkyl chain distances the polar head group
from the anchoring pyrene moiety, which leads to a higher charge density
on the surface of rGO, resulting in the inhibition of reaggregation.
Irrespective of an incomplete understanding of the underlying reasons
behind these results, the empirical observation that the simple homologation
of PSA increases the exfoliation efficiency of rGO warranted further
analysis, which led us to investigate graphite exfoliation using this
agent.

the starting GO dispersion as is expected after the washing procedures;
both stabilizers show almost identical distributions.

2.4 Direct Graphite Exfoliation
Preparing
large quantities of graphene by the direct exfoliation of graphite
into solution represents a major challenge.63 Hence, we also determined the ability of PBSA to exfoliate and stabilize
graphene by the LPE of graphite in water using tip sonication.64 We modeled our study on the protocol developed
by Green et al.22 who noted that under
optimized conditions, exfoliation of graphite in the presence of PSA
(stabilizer/graphite = 1:30, w/w) afforded dispersions with a concentration
of up to 3 mg mL–1. A large excess of graphite is
required in this process with upward of 95% not being exfoliated during
sonication. In this protocol, each sample was tip-sonicated for 1
h and centrifuged to remove the residual insoluble graphitic material.
The concentration for EG derived in this manner using PBSA was more
than double that achieved using PSA, 0.34 ± 0.14 and 0.15 ±
0.05 mg mL–1 for PBSA and PSA, respectively (Figure 4a). Concentrations
were determined by filtration, TGA, and the Beer–Lambert method
to extract an extinction coefficient for both dispersions (see the Supporting Information for details). Extinction
coefficients for the two dispersions were found to be 5917 and 5240
L g–1 m–1 at 660 nm for PBSA and
PSA, respectively. These values are very similar to the latest results
for exfoliated graphite dispersions cited in the literature and to
that used in the rGO analysis discussed above.65,66

Figure 4 (a)
Concentration values and standard deviation for EG and photographs of the diluted dispersions,
where the increased concentration is evident using PBSA, whose results
were consistent with those using rGO; (b) flake height (thickness)
distribution from AFM analysis showing the majority of the flakes
to be 1.5 nm thickness and containing monolayer, bilayer, and multilayer
flakes. Both stabilizers show similar shape distributions; (c) Raman
spectra for EG-stabilized dispersions; and (d) flake size distribution
and AFM images (inset) for the graphene dispersions.

This result is very similar to that obtained for
rGO, where again
the increase in concentration is plainly evident merely by inspection
with the naked eye (Figure 4, inset); however, unlike with rGO, the flake height and lateral
flake size distribution is different (Figure 4b,d). Direct exfoliation of graphite does
not produce solely monolayer graphene but instead gives a distribution
of single, double, and multilayered flakes. Figure 4d shows that the flake size is different
for the two stabilizers. Exfoliation with PBSA generates a broad distribution
of flake sizes between 5 and 950 nm and a mean lateral flake size
of 380 nm, whereas dispersion with PSA generates materials with a
narrower flake size distribution between 5 and 450 nm with a mean
size of 180 nm. This observation may suggest that either PBSA enhances
the exfoliation process and allows for larger flakes to be mechanically
sheared from the graphite or PBSA is able to stabilize larger flakes
of EG in solution without reaggregation. The flake dimensions are
further confirmed in the Raman spectra (Figure 4c).

Peak fitting of the 2D band in
the Raman spectra (Supporting Information) shows few-layer graphene present in
both samples when measured over 30 points. This is similar to that
found in other works17,45 and demonstrates that the EG
concentration increase when using PBSA is not to the detriment of
flake quality. The large D band in the Raman spectra of both PSA and
PBSA dispersions (Figure 4c) can be attributed to all flakes being below the laser spot
size used to analyze the samples (∼0.5–1 μm),
leading to a high contribution to the intensity from flake edges.
This is further supported by the prominent D′ band in both
spectra with both samples showing an ID/ID′ ratio of ∼3, indicative
of edge defects.67 Zeta potential measurements
for EG dispersions stabilized by PBSA have a larger negative zeta
potential (−46 ± 1 mV) when compared to the PSA-stabilized
dispersions (−41 ± 1 mV), which confirms a larger negative
charge on the graphene surface, thereby enhancing the stabilization
using this agent, in line with the results seen for rGO.

2.5 Computational Simulations
We have
conducted a number of theoretical studies in order to provide a greater
understanding of the binding of PSA and PBSA to the surface of graphene
with the ultimate aim of defining those structural features, which
may impart greater stabilizer efficiency. We have used quantum mechanical
(QM) studies to focus on electronic effects and classical molecular
dynamical simulations, which permit a more thorough study of conformational
effects (see the Supporting Information for full modeling procedures).

2.5.1 QM Studies
As
the exfoliation efficiency
of PSA and PBSA toward graphene was conducted in water, it was deemed
important that any analysis of these processes, from a theoretical
standpoint, must take solvation effects into account. We have previously
shown that the semiempirical molecular orbital (MO) method corrected
for dispersive interactions (PM6-DH2)68 can predict both the adsorption energies of unsaturated hydrocarbons
on graphene and the effect of substitution on these values to an accuracy
comparable to density functional theory (DFT) values where these energies
are in good agreement with the experimental determined values. The
effect of bulk solvation can be included by means of the COSMO continuum
model. Interaction energies (IEs) between PSA and PBSA with graphene
(graphene sheet consisting of 1006 carbon atoms, end-capped with hydrogen)
were therefore calculated at the PM6-DH2 level including solvation
effects. In these studies, the polar sulfonate residues were explicitly
solvated with three water molecules, where the hydrogen atoms of the
water were directed toward the oxygen of the sulfonate residue, and
the COSMO solvation model was then applied to the system as a whole.
This analysis resulted in IEs of −111.3 and −123.8 kJ
mol–1 for the deposition of PSA and PBSA, respectively,
onto the model graphene surface. We suggest that the difference in
IEs for these two substrates is due, in part, to hydrophobic effects.
In the case of 5, the n-butyl spacer
is able to rest on the surface of the graphene in a manner reminiscent
to that proposed by Groszek.69 This QM
analysis suggests that π–π interactions dominate
the binding of these molecules to the graphene, as the difference
in binding energy between the two species is a modest 12.5 kJ mol–1 (i.e., 123.8–111.3 kJ mol–1). Specifically, in the case of PBSA, this QM analysis suggests that
in the bulk solution, the n-butyl spacer adopts an
idealized, chain-extended, zigzag conformation (Figure 5a) similar to that observed for the single-crystal
X-ray structure of PBA.70 When PBSA approaches
the surface of graphene, the n-butyl side chain adopts
a new conformationa, resulting in a stabilizing
hydrophobic interaction between H(38), H(40), H(42), H(43), and H(44)
and the graphene surface (Figure 5b). This conformational switch enables the polar head
group to interact with the bulk solvent [C(20)–S(21) is projected
at an angle of ca. 80° away from the basal plane of the pyrene
core] where it appears that each oxygen of the sulfonate salt can
enter into hydrogen bonding with the bulk solvent water. In the parent
compound, PSA, a similar QM analysis (Supporting Information) indicates that two of the oxygen atoms of the
sulfonate moiety are pointing either toward the surface of the graphene
or parallel to it, leaving the third oxygen exposed to the bulk solvent
(Figure 6).33,71,72

Figure 5 (a) Minimized structure of PBSA in bulk
water (top) and that of
PBSA adsorbed onto the surface of graphene using PM3-DH2 (bottom)
and (b) minimized structure of PSA, 1, adsorbed onto the surface of
graphene using PM3-DH2.

of the number density, within the simulation box, of aromatic carbon
(gray filled dotted line) sulfur (orange filled solid line) and sodium
counterions (blue filled dashed line) as a function of distance from
the graphene surface, located at 0 nm. This plot demonstrates that
a high proportion of sulfur head groups and associated sodium counterions
are found a significant distance away from the surface for PBSA as
compared to that for PSA; (e) torsional data for PBSA when adsorbed
onto the surface of graphene.

In summation, a QM analysis, which takes solvation into account,
suggests that the introduction of a hydrophobic spacer group between
the polar sulfonate residue and the pyrene core of PSA, leading to
PBSA, generates a substrate with a higher IE with the surface of graphene,
which, in principle, could translate into a more efficient stabilizer.
Our QM approach generates structures that are similar to those generated
by vdW-corrected DFT calculations for PBA adsorbed onto the surface
of graphene72 and provides a potentially
useful model for the development of new stabilizers.73

2.5.2 Molecular Dynamics Simulations
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were also carried out in order
to gain insights into the interactions between PSA and PBSA with a
model graphene surface (see the Supporting Information for details) when placed in an aqueous environment. In the bulk
solvent phase, these calculations indicate that PSA has a tendency
for self-aggregation (Supporting Information, Figure S12a,b) behavior, which has been previously verified experimentally
for 1.74,75 MD simulations were used to generate a potential
of mean force (PMF) for the adsorption of PSA and PBSA onto a graphene
surface in water showing that PBSA has a more favorable free energy
of adsorption (−72.3 kJ mol–1) than PSA (−52.5
kJ mol–1), which can be primarily attributed to
the additional carbons in the alkyl chain. Critically, PBSA has a
slightly higher contribution to the overall energy from the aromatic
core and a smaller energy associated with the sulfonate group (Supporting Information). The aliphatic carbons
contribute to the overall free energy of adsorption, although individually
they are only weakly interacting with the graphene surface.

MD simulations for PSA indicate that this molecule approaches the
graphene surface along a “nose down” vector, in which
the pyrene approaches on a trajectory that is orthogonal to the graphene
surface and eventually adopts an equilibrium structure in which the
pyrene ring system is approximately parallel to the basal plane of
graphene. For PSA, the PMF (Figure 6a) has a minimum, point c, when the center of mass
is at an equilibrium distance (z) of 0.38 nm from
the graphene surface. The calculated average IE at this distance is
−114.0 kJ mol–1, of which −20.5 kJ
mol–1 is derived from the interaction of the sulfonate
head group with the graphene. These values are in remarkably close
agreement with those previously calculated, with the total IE being
remarkably close to our QM value (vide supra). As anticipated,76 interaction of PSA with graphene generates a
number of rapidly interconverting topologies in which the pyrene core
of the dispersant is able to glide72 along
the surface of the graphene (Supporting Information, Figure S12 snapshots c–e). It should be noted that in the
final averaged structure for PSA adsorbed onto the graphene surface,
both O(18) and O(20) are directed toward the surface of the graphene,
whereas O(19) is directed toward the bulk solvent. Torsion about C(16)–S(17)
[C(7)–C(16)–C(17)–O(20) = −9.9°;
C(7)–C(16)–S(17)–O(18) = 110.8°] reduces
nonbonded interactions between the sulfonate residue and the pyrene
ring, thus enabling the dipole associated with S(17)–O(19)
to interact with the solvent [C(7)–C(16)–S(17)–O(19)
= −129.4]. The interaction of O(18) and O(20) with the graphene
surface causes a distortion within the adsorbate molecule such that
the C(16)–S(17) bond is bent away from the mean plane of the
pyrene core by 20.6°. Interaction of the sulfonate residue with
the graphene surface also forces the pyrene core to adopt a nonparallel
alignment with the graphene surface, such that the mean plane containing
the pyrene system has a tilt angle of 3.5° with respect to the
graphene surface (Figure 6c). The fact that the pyrene core of PSA is not parallel to
the graphene surface at the point of minimum energy, c, and that two
of the oxygen atoms of the sulfonate group are pointing toward the
graphene surface may result in less than the optimal π–π
interaction of the pyrene core with the graphene surface or solvation
by the bulk solvent water. Indeed, it was this speculation that led
us to prepare the substrate PBSA with a view to comparing its exfoliating
efficiency with that of PSA.

In the case of PBSA, MD calculations
suggest that in the bulk solvent,
aggregation is again observed in a manner similar to that predicted
for the aggregation of PBA prior to adsorption onto the surface of
graphene (Supporting Information, Figure
S13 snapshots a,b).34 However, as PBSA
approaches, the surface of the graphene deaggregation and then attachment
to the surface are observed. As with PSA, PBSA is able to adopt a
range of topologies with respect to the alignment of the pyrene core
and the hexagonally packed carbon atoms of the graphene surface (Supporting Information, Figure S13c–e).
The PMF for PBSA (Figure 6b) exhibits a minimum when the center of mass, z, is at a distance of 0.39 nm from the graphene surface (Figure 6b snapshot c). It
is evident that the conformation adopted in snapshot c is not the
same as the dominant conformation adopted in the bulk (snapshot a; z = 0.9 nm) or as PBSA approaching the surface of the graphene
(snapshot b; z = 0.5 nm). The calculated average
IE at 0.39 nm is −134.4 kJ mol–1, of which
−16.3 kJ mol–1 is derived from the interaction
of the sulfonate head group with the graphene. In passing, it should be noted that the conformation adopted by the butyl side chain in
PBSA in Figure 6 (snapshot
c) is also similar to that proposed for the most stable conformation
adopted by PBA when adsorbed onto the surface of graphene.34,72

This series of MD simulations also provides an analysis of
density
profiles of multiple stabilizer molecules interacting with a graphene
surface. Figure 6d
shows the density profiles for the aromatic carbons in the pyrene
core, the sulfur atoms in the sulfonate groups, and the sodium counterions
in the aqueous medium for both PSA and PBSA. These results suggest,
as expected, that the aromatic core of both substrates is close to
the graphene surface for both stabilizers (∼0.3 nm). For PSA
(i.e., the stabilizer without the n-butyl chain),
the majority of the sulfonate groups reside in the same layer as the
aromatic carbons, which is to be compared with PBSA in which a significant
portion of the sulfur atoms is found at a distance of ≈0.8
nm from the graphene surface. In the case of PBSA, most of the sulfonate
groups are located further above the graphene surface, which infers
that the n-butyl side chain in PBSA points away from
the graphene surface for higher stabilizer concentrations. The fact
that the density of aromatic carbons close to the graphene surface
is about 25% higher for PBSA when compared to PSA also infers that
monolayer formation, rather than the stacking of the pyrene cores,
is favored in such cases, which also has the net effect of increasing
the concentration of negative charge on the graphene surface (as confirmed
by zeta potential measurements) and hence increase the stability of
the EG with respect to reaggregation.

An analysis of torsional
data for the conformational preferences
of the n-butyl spacer for adsorbed PBSA was also
obtained for a single molecule of PBSA (see the Supporting Information). The results of this simulation are
depicted in Figure 6e. Here, we observe that for a single PBSA molecule,
the n-butyl spacer lies flat on the graphene surface,
with a C(2′)–C(1′)–C(1)–C(2) torsion
angle of ∼5°. At higher PBSA concentrations, there again
appears to be a conformational switch such that the torsion angle
about C(2′)–C(1′)–C(1)–C(2) becomes
∼90°. In this case, the alkyl side chain is orthogonal
to the graphene surface with the sulfonate residue pointing into solution,
thereby maximizing solvation by bulk water. We posit therefore that
the conformational flexibility afforded by PBSA results in more efficient
packing of the pyrene core, leading to a greater charge density on
the graphene surface, which is reflected in the higher measured zeta
potential for this system.

Taken together, these results infer
therefore that in the case
of PBSA, solvation of the ArSO3⊖ moiety by water
competes favorably with any potential interaction of this moiety with
the graphene surface. The possibility of additional stabilizing interactions
between the C–H groups of the aliphatic chain of the stabilizer
with the graphene surface is also maximized by the adoption of a chain-extended,
zigzag conformation in which nonbonded interactions between vicinal
CH2 groups are minimized. The ability of PBSA to populate these
configurations once bound to the graphene surface optimizes solvation
of the polar sulfonate group, maximizes π–π interactions,
and facilitates the generation of additional stabilizing van der Waals
interactions as well as prevents the reaggregation of the EG.

Although the theory described above and the experimental AFM data
for the exfoliated data generated by PBSA are in accord with the “sandwich”
structures that are commonly described in the literature for exfoliated
rGO (i.e., a monolayer of stabilizer molecules attached to each surface
of the exfoliated material43,57), it is by no means
certain that our rather simplistic model leading to exfoliation is
wholly accurate.b For example, it is possible
that the dispersant used in the present study (PBSA), which may well
aggregate in aqueous solution,59,75 could generate bi-
or multilayers77 on the graphene surface
or that PBSA could act as a molecular wedge during exfoliation.72 A search of the literature reveals that many
authors are circumspect concerning the nature of dispersant graphene
aggregates, as has been recently noted by Bühlmann and co-workers,78 who conclude that monolayer formation of the
dispersant on the graphene surface is often assumed and not pursued
rigorously. Of relevance to our investigation is that there is evidence
for the formation of monolayers when pyrenebutyric acid, which is
structurally similar to PBSA, is deposited onto the surface graphene.34,79 It is clear however that additional studies, both in silico and
in vitro, are required in order to derive a more fuller understanding
of the exfoliation process, especially with respect to the aggregation
state of the dispersant on the surface of the exfoliated material.

3 Conclusions
In this study, we present
our initial findings directed toward
the rational design of aqueous graphene dispersants. In this study,
we demonstrate that PBSA (which is readily prepared from commercially
available 1-pyrenebutanoic acid, 2, in an operationally
simple three-step synthesis) is a more efficient stabilizer of EG
and rGO than commercially available PSA. In silico analysis of the
binding of these molecules to the surface of graphene suggests that
the addition of an n-butyl spacer between the pyrene
core and the polar sulfonic acid residue allows the aromatic carbons
of PBSA to lie parallel to, and bind more avidly with, the graphene
surface, whereas the alkyl spacer has sufficient conformational freedom
to direct the polar sulfonate residue into the bulk solvent. In contrast,
binding of the commercially available stabilizer, PSA, to the surface
of graphene forces the sulfonate group to interact with the graphene
surface and lessens potential interaction with bulk water. We also
suggest that the presence of the n-butyl chain in
PBSA enables both more efficient packing of the stabilizer on the
graphene surface and a lessened electrostatic repulsion80 between adsorbed molecules on the surface of
the graphene. Overall, this has the result of an increase in the zeta
potential of the PBSA-dispersed material compared to that obtained
with PSA, which increases its stability relative to the PSA-exfoliated
material in solution. Having shown that a simple structural change
can have an observable effect on the stabilizer efficiency and that
these effects can be rationalized using computational methods, the
development of a rational approach to stabilizer design and the mapping
of the exfoliant once bound to the EG/rGO surface is now under active
investigation.81

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Synthesis of PBSA
Full experimental
details concerning the preparation of PBSA49,50 can be found in the Supporting Information accompanying this paper.

4.2 rGO Dispersion Preparation
GO was
prepared by a modified Hummers method whereby natural flake graphite
(30 mesh, >96% C) was oxidized and exfoliated using H2SO4, NaNO3, KMnO4, and H2O2.82 The resulting gel was
repeatedly
washed and exfoliated using a 3% wt H2SO4/0.5%
wt H2O2 mixture and then brought to a pH of
7 using deionized (DI) water. The reduction of GO was performed in
the presence of a stabilizer using l-ascorbic acid (Sigma-Aldrich)
as the reducing agent. First, 60.0 mg of PSA (Sigma-Aldrich, 1, 9.9 mM) or PBSA (5, 8.3 mM) was added to an
aqueous dispersion of GO (1 mg mL–1, 20 mL) and
bath-sonicated (Elma P70H) for 30 min. Then, l-ascorbic acid
(140.0 mg) was allowed to dissolve into the dispersion before being
heated to 80 °C for 72 h. The mixture was subjected to bath sonication
(15 min) and washed by centrifugation (Thermo Sorvall XTR, 15 000
rpm, 45 min) in order to remove the excess stabilizer. Here, 75% of
the supernatant was removed from the dispersion and replaced with
an equivalent amount of DI water, followed by further sonication to
redisperse the sediment. The sonication and washing steps were repeated
5 times, after which the dispersions were filtered through fine wool
to remove any remaining aggregates. The filtered dispersions were
used for all subsequent characterizations.

4.3 Production
of Exfoliated Graphene
EG dispersions were prepared using
probe sonication of graphite flakes.
Initially, 18 mg of a pyrene stabilizer (PSA, 9.9 mM or PBSA, 8.3
mM) was added to 6 mL of DI water, heated, and stirred (85 °C,
10 min) to disperse the stabilizer. Each sample was then tip-sonicated
in a 12 mL vial (tip depth ∼2 cm, Misonix Sonicator 3000, 24
W, 20 min) to ensure homogeneity. Flake graphite [30 mesh, >96%
C,
(540 mg)] was then added to the dispersion. The mixture was subjected
to tip sonication for 1 h at 9 W, and an ice-water bath was used to
maintain a low temperature. The mixture was then centrifuged (Eppendorf
5418 centrifuge, 5000 rpm, 1 h) to remove any unexfoliated graphite,
and the supernatant was collected for further analysis.

4.4 Dispersion Characterization Techniques
Dispersions
were spin-coated (3000 rpm) onto silicon substrates with
290 nm thermally grown SiO2 for SEM, Raman, and AFM analyses.
Flake size measurements were carried out on individual flakes using
SEM micrographs (Zeiss Ultra Plus, InLens Detector), measuring 250
flakes along the same axis, and assuming a statistically random orientation
of the flakes during sample preparation. Raman spectra were recorded
using a Renishaw InVia spectrometer with a 514 nm laser at 1 mW power.
The D and G peak intensities from the rGO Raman spectra were derived
from peak fitting using a Gaussian/Lorentzian peak shape and deconvolution
of the G peak accounting for a large D′. The EG Raman 2D peak
fitting was carried out using multiple peaks with a full width at
half-maximum of 24 cm–1. AFM images were acquired
using a Bruker instrument with a FastScan head and processed using
WSxM. XPS of the starting GO powder and a nonstabilized washed rGO
was carried out on a SPECS spectrometer. Zeta potential of dilute
samples (approx. 100 times dilution) was measured using a Malvern
Zetasizer NanoZS. Concentrations of the EG dispersions were estimated
using UV–vis spectroscopy (Varian Cary 5000). Spectra were
obtained for five dispersions diluted 30 times using a quartz cell
with a path length of 1 mm. Absorbance at 660 nm was used to estimate
the relative concentrations using absorbance over path length as described
in the main text. Concentrations for the rGO dispersions were estimated
using UV–vis spectroscopy (Thermo Genesys 10 s) with the machine
set to measure at 660 nm, utilizing absorbance over path length. Three
dispersions were measured using 10 mm path length quartz cells.

4.5 MD Simulations
MD simulations were
carried out using the GROMACS software, version 5.0.4.83 All simulations were performed in the canonical
ensemble with the temperature maintained at 298 K using the Nosé–Hoover
thermostat and a 1 ps relaxation time constant.84,85 Equations of motion were integrated using the leapfrog algorithm
with a time step of 1 fs. For the force field, the CHARMM86−88 parameters were used to model graphene and the stabilizer molecules,
the parameters of Joung and Cheatham89 for
Na+ and TIP3P for water.90 The
graphene sheet was frozen in place for the duration of the simulations.
Electrostatic interactions were accounted for using the particle mesh
Ewald method,91,92 and nonbonded interactions were
cut off smoothly from 1.0 to 1.2 nm. For the PMF calculations, a graphene
sheet was positioned at the bottom of a simulation cell with dimensions
3.7 nm × 3.8 nm × 5.0 nm. A stabilizer molecule was placed
in the center of the cell, and the remainder was filled with water
and one randomly positioned Na+ counterion. The PMFs were
calculated using an umbrella sampling procedure93,94 and the weighted histogram analysis method.95,96 In this procedure, the stabilizers were pulled onto the graphene
sheet (at z = 0) using a harmonic potential with
a force constant of 2500 kJ mol–1 nm–2 over 20 simulation windows from z = 2.2–0.3
nm. Each simulation was performed for 20 ns, and only the data from
the final 19 ns were used to generate the PMF. An additional 10 ns
simulation of the stabilizer adsorbed to the graphene sheet, without
an umbrella potential, was carried out to obtain the IEs. In order
to understand the orientation of the butyl spacer when PBSA is adsorbed,
dihedral angle distributions were calculated from a 50 ns simulation,
saving trajectory data for analysis every 1 ps to obtain smooth distributions.
Higher concentrations of stabilizers were studied using a larger simulation
cell (5.2 nm × 5.1 nm × 7.5 nm). An aqueous solution, consisting
of 25 randomly distributed stabilizers 25 Na+ counterions
and 3600 water molecules, was positioned on the surface, leaving a
3.5 nm vacuum gap between the top of the solution and the bottom of
the periodic image of the graphene sheet. All 25 stabilizer molecules
were slowly pulled toward the surface at a rate of 0.002 nm ps–1, using a harmonic potential with a force constant
of 5000 kJ mol–1 nm–2 over 1.5
ns, followed by a 50 ns simulation in the absence of the harmonic
potential. The data collected from the final 40 ns of this simulation
were used to calculate the stabilizer density profiles.

4.6 QM Calculations
The QM calculations
were carried using the PM6-DH297 approach
as implemented in MOPAC2012.98 PBSA was
placed near the center of a 1006 carbon atom graphene sheet, terminated
with 88 hydrogen atoms, with the sulfonate group solvated by three
explicit water molecules. Bulk solvation effects of water were modeled
by the COSMO approach employing a dielectric constant of 78.355. Geometry
optimization was carried out on all structures and the energetics
determined as the difference in energy of these optimized structures.
