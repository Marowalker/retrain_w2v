Thiol–ene
click chemistry has become a powerful paradigm
in synthesis, materials science, and surface modification in the past
decade. In the photoinitiated thiol–ene reaction, an induction
period is often observed before the major change in its kinetic curve,
for which a possible mechanism is proposed in this report. Briefly,
light soaking generates radicals following the zeroth-order reaction
kinetics. The radical is the reactant that initializes the chain reaction
of thiol–ene coupling, which is a first-order reaction. Combining
both and under the light-limited conditions, a surprising kinetics
represented by a Gaussian-like model evolves that is different from
the exponential model used to describe the first-order reaction of
the final product. The experimental data are fitted well with the
new model, and the reaction kinetic constants can be pulled out from
the fitting.

Introduction
Click reactions have been one of the widely
used methods for chemical
synthesis because of their properties, as defined by Sharpless in
2001, which are as follows: (a) they produce high yields under mild
conditions, (b) they are not affected by the presence of oxygen and
water, and (c) they are compatible with a wide variety of starting
materials, which selectively react only with each other (i.e., the
reaction is orthogonal to other organic reactions).1 The reaction between an alkene, or an alkyne, and a thiol
is widely accepted as having the properties of a click reaction.2 It has become a powerful tool in various synthetic
methodologies, biofunctionalization, surface and polymer modification,
and polymerization.3−15 This thiol–ene click reaction can follow two different mechanisms
depending on the type of initiator that is used.8 The base-catalyzed thiol–ene (also called thiol-Michael
addition) reaction is initiated by adding a nucleophile, usually phosphines.16,17 Or the reaction is initiated by exposing the thiols to heat or UV
light, which generate thiyl radicals that will react with the alkene,
or alkyne (Figure 1A).18−22

coupling reaction catalyzed by the addition of a chemical photoinitiator
(PI).22 (B) Schemes of the two reactions
in this report.

In a series of recent
studies, the most important factor governing
the overall kinetics of thiol–ene polymerization was found
by Bowman and co-workers to be the ratio of the propagation rate (kP) to the chain-transfer rate (kCT).8,16,17,20,23−29 The reaction kinetics is simplified into first-order reactions with
respect to either thiol or alkene, or both, depending on the kP/kCT ratio.24 This explains the overall exponential growth
curve of the product but ignores the short induction period that is
often observed before the steep portion of the growth curve, making
it difficult to extract the rate constants from the curve fitting.
Here, we propose an expanded mechanism to explain the induction period
using the same kinetic model from the literature but taking the photoinitiator
into account.

In this report, we measured the reaction kinetics
of vinyltrimethoxysilane
(VTMS) with thioglycolic acid (TGA) photoinitiated by 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone
(DMPA), and VTMS with cysteamine hydrochloride (CAH) also photoinitiated
by DMPA (Figure 1B)
using 1H NMR spectroscopy. The mixture was exposed to a
368–400 nm light source that is 3 cm away from the sample.
Silanes were used in this study because many applications require
the immobilization of a molecule tailored for a specific property
via the silane group. The ability to couple a molecule to a silane
through thiol–ene click reactions widens the range of molecules
that can be grafted onto oxide surfaces.

Experimental Section
All reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and all spectra
were collected using a Bruker Ascend 500 MHz NMR spectrometer under
the same instrument options. Reactants TGA (or CAH), VTMS, and photoinitiator
DMPA were added into an NMR tube, with solvent CDCl3 for
the VTMS (0.427 M), TGA (0.857 M), and DMPA (0.03 M) mixture, and
(CD3)2CO–D2O (1:4 v/v) co-solvent
for the VTMS (0.058 M), CAH (0.112 M), and DMPA (0.012 M) mixture
to dissolve both the CAH salt and the nonpolar aromatic DMPA. Both
solutions were split into two equal portions. One portion was exposed
to a 368–400 nm light source with a visible light-blocking
filter (Sunlite SL20 lamp, 20 W). The lamp was placed ∼3 cm
away from the sample, where the power density was ∼4 mW/cm2 measured using a Thor Labs PM100-S121C photodiode sensor.
UV exposure was done at specific time intervals under room temperature
prior to 1H NMR measurements. The remaining portions of
both solutions were left unexposed and kept as the experimental controls.
Baseline correction of all 1H NMR spectra, peak area calculations,
and curve fitting (using least-squares regression analysis) were performed
using MATLAB.

Results and Discussion
The 1H NMR spectra in Figure 2 confirm the formation of the click reaction
products from the thiol–ene coupling of the VTMS with TGA (Figure 2A), or with CAH (Figure 2B). The coupling
reaction in the mixture of VTMS, TGA, and DMPA was complete in less
than 5 min of exposure to UV light (Figure 2A). The NMR spectra before and after UV exposure
in Figure 2A clearly
show the disappearance of the vinyl peaks in VTMS (at 5.8, 5.9, and
6.1 ppm) and the appearance of new peaks at 1.0 and 2.7 ppm that indicate
the presence of the thioether product.30 The intensity of the TGA thiol peak at around 2.0 ppm was also reduced
to half, which is consistent with the initial thiol–vinyl concentration
ratio of 2:1 and a 1:1 thiol–vinyl reaction stoichiometry.
These initial ratios have been reported to produce the highest yield
in the shortest time.9 The peaks around
3.6 ppm in Figure 2A come from the hydrolysis of the Si–OCH3 groups.
Control experiments showed that indoor room lighting has no effect
and that UV light is necessary for initiating the thiol–ene
reaction. Without UV exposure, the NMR spectra in the control experiment
(Figure 2C) indicate
that no reaction occurs after 1 h of incubation at room temperature
and under room light.

of the unexposed reaction mixtures of (C) VTMS with TGA showing no
change in the vinyl and thiol peaks, and (D) VTMS with CAH also showing
no change in the vinyl peak without UV light exposure.

The absence of VTMS-homopolymerization products
is consistent with
the click property of the thiol–ene coupling reported in the
literature,8 whose products would have
shown NMR peaks between 0.5 and 0.9 ppm for the methyl protons in
the −Si–CH2– group,31−33 which were
negligible in the 1H NMR spectra that were collected.

The 1H NMR spectra of the mixture of VTMS, CAH, and
DMPA before and after exposure to UV light are shown in Figure 2B. The hydrogen peak of HOD
at ∼4.4 ppm is broadened due to its hydrogen bonding to the
other molecules; peaks from the −SH and NH3+ exchanges with D2O and are not observed; hydrogen
in Si–OCH3 is observed at 3.2 ppm; hydrogens in
N–CH2–CH2 are observed around
3.8 and 3.4 ppm, respectively.34 The progress
of the reaction can be most clearly tracked through the disappearance
of the signal from the vinyl group at 5.9 ppm and the appearance of
the thioether-specific peaks at 2.7 and 0.9 ppm.30 The reason for seeing only one peak near the center of
the chemical shifts for the vinyl group is due to the peak broadening
caused by self-aggregation.35 The methoxy
groups of VTMS are partially hydrolyzed in D2O and the
silanes are cross-linked, which may cause the peaks between 3.2 and
3 ppm. The reaction between VTMS and CAH was complete after 150 s
of UV exposure (Figure 2B), with the thioether as the only product. The spectra from the
control experiment without UV light is shown in Figure 2D, again confirming that UV light is required
as indicated by the absence of the thioether product peaks (2.7 and
0.9 ppm) and the retention of the vinyl peak (5.9 ppm).

The
kinetics of both reactions were monitored with a series of 1H NMR spectra collected after every exposure interval (Figure 3), with the decay
curves shown in Figure 4. In the VTMS–TGA coupling (Figure 4A), the vinyl (red traces) peak gradually
disappears, while the thiol (black traces) peak was gradually reduced
to roughly half after exposure to UV light over time. At the same
time, there was a gradual increase in the peak intensities centered
at 2.73 ppm (green traces) and 0.98 ppm (blue traces), both specific
to the thioether product. Figure 4B shows a plot of the integrated peak areas corresponding
to each moiety in Figure 4A as a function of exposure time. The data indicate that the
photoinitiated reaction between VTMS and TGA has a short induction
time followed by an exponential decay of the reactants, with a corresponding
exponential growth of the thioether product. The yield for TGA and
VTMS is >90%. The yield for CAH and VTMS is ∼50%. The relatively
lower yield of the VTMS and CAH reaction is due to the recently observed
inhibition of thiol–ene reactions by amine groups.36 Induction times were also observed in other
photocatalytic reactions.19,28,29,37 The length of the induction time
is dependent on the reaction conditions, such as light intensity.25,38

regions shown in (C), where the scatter plots and solid traces represent

were fitted using eqs 11–13.

The kinetics of the photoinitiated thiol–ene reactions
is
best described by a half-Gaussian function, as shown by the solid
curves in Figure 4B,D.
The photocatalytic reaction cycle shown in Figure 1 has been assumed to have two competing steps
in the literature, chain transfer and chain propagation.8,27 The relative rate constants of these processes and the chain initialization
and termination processes will determine the kinetic trajectory of
the reaction. These processes can be specified to have the following
elementary reactions expanded from the model in the literature27 1   2   3   4   5   6   7  where PI is the
photoinitiator that has not
been considered in the literature model;24,27 R is an unknown molecule (e.g., another PI, oxygen, or other molecules);
S, V, and SV are the thiol, vinyl, and thioether products, respectively;
and “•” indicates if the species is
a radical. These reactions can be grouped into three major processes. Reactions 1 and 2 are the initiation steps of the photochemical reaction. Reactions 3 and 4 are the chain-transfer and chain-propagation steps, respectively. Reactions 5–7 are the termination steps of the photoinitiated
thiol–ene reaction. Varying the rates of reactions 3–7 has resulted
in various exponential curves with no obvious induction period.24 Thus, we assume the photoactivation steps to
be the rate-limiting steps to check if they contribute to the induction
period. This assumption is reasonable because of the low light intensity
used in this study (4 mW/cm2, ∼4% sunlight intensity
at air mass 1.5).

Solving these reactions is difficult for us,
but useful equations
can be drawn with approximations. The reaction rate can be expressed
as a function of exposure time, t, and reactant concentrations,
from step 4, which produces the thioether product 8  We can assume
that the concentration of the
activated [SV•] is small and rate-limited by the
light exposure because the concentration of the photoinitiator [PI]
is much smaller than the concentration of vinyl [V] and thiol [S]
and because the light source is relatively weak, thus making [PI•] and [R•] small. Assuming typical
light-limited photoreactions as zeroth-order reactions and assuming
a relatively small termination rate compared to the chain-transfer
rate,27 the concentration of the photoactivated
[SV•] radical at any time, t, can
be approximated as 9  where k8 is a
new constant, which under light-limited conditions is directly proportional
to k1, e.g., k8 = k1, when the radical propagation rate
is much higher than the termination rate. By combining eqs 8 and 9, we
get 10  where k9 = k4 × k8 is another
new constant, [S]0 is the initial concentration of the
thiol, which is consumed to form the equal amount of [SV]t. After integration with the boundary condition that
at time = 0, [SV]0 = 0, we get 11   12   13  These three Gaussian equations are different
from the exponential decay functions used in the literature,24 but explain our light-limited induction period
better (Figure 4B,D,
fitted curves). A short induction period has been commonly observed
in the literature for thiol–ene and thiol–yne couplings.22,27,39 This bulk kinetic analysis allowed
us to estimate the value of k9 under our
experimental conditions (Table 1) and thus select a relatively longer exposure time than the
half-life, t1/2, for the surface-grafting
experiments, where from eq 12 14  We note that at a higher light intensity,
the photoactivated photoinitiator reaches a steady state quickly (when eq 9 becomes [SV•] = k8), and the kinetic equations (eqs 11 and 12) converge into the single-exponential decay functions found
in the literature.22,27,39 The treatment of the rate-limiting step is different in this report
compared to that in the literature, which allows us to predict the
induction period observed under our reaction conditions.

In summary, we have extended the existing kinetic
model and demonstrated
proof-of-concept experimental evaluations to provide a more complete
reaction mechanism for thiol–ene click reactions. The observed
consumption rates of the reactants and formation rates of products
were best fit by half-Gaussian functions (eqs 11–13) that contain
induction periods. These functions look empirical but are supported
by the proposed light-limited reaction mechanism. When the photoinitiating
step of the chain-reaction model is the rate-limiting step, a short
induction period emerges prior to the exponential-like growth of the
product (or decay of the reactant) concentration. This mechanism may
help the researchers to elucidate and understand the factors that
underlie the confusing kinetic curves observed before.
