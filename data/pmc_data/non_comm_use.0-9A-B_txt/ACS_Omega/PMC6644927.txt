NiCo2O4 nanostructure is a widely studied
pseudocapacitor material because of its high specific capacitance
value. Most of the time, the thickness of the nanostructure inhibits
the electrode material from whole-body participation and causes sluggish
charge transportation. These phenomena directly interfere with the
electrochemical performance of the electrode, such as specific capacitance
value, stability, energy density, and so forth. Here, two different
thin two-dimensional morphologies (nanosheet and nanoplate) of the
NiCo2O4 nanocomposite with a large lateral size
are reported using ammonia as a hydrolyzing agent. The large size
and flat surface of the as-synthesized materials offer enormous active
sites during the electrochemical reaction, and the thin wall makes
the ion penetration and transportation very effective and facile.
Therefore, the NiCo2O4 nanosheet and nanoplate
structures exhibited high specific capacitance values of 1540 and
1333 F/g, respectively, with excellent rate and good cycling stability.
Here also, two different advance aqueous asymmetric supercapacitors
have been reported utilizing two NiCo2O4 nanostructure
materials as positive electrodes and the rGO@Fe3O4 composite as a negative electrode, which exhibited excellent rate
and high specific energy without sacrificing the specific power. We
also studied the electrochemical activity of the rGO@Fe3O4 composite at different compositions.

Introduction
Our existing energy
sources are fixed and are gradually depleting
day by day. This demands new research for energy harvesting or storage.
In both cases, the quality of electrode materials becomes the most
important concern, which actually administers the excellence of the
device. The electrochemical capacitor, which is also known as the
supercapacitor, is a promising energy storage device for future applications
because of its several advantages, such as high power density, high
cyclic durability, fast charge–discharge (ch–dch) process,
and so forth.1 Till now, it has not been
commercialized properly because of some of its limitations, mainly
low energy density.1 In the early stages
of research, carbon was the only material that was used as the electrochemical
capacitor. Different carbonaceous materials such as graphene, graphene
oxide (GO), carbon nanotube (both single-walled and multiwalled),
activated carbon, and so forth have been used so far. In these cases,
electrostatic charge separation on the electrode−electrolyte
interface is the reason behind the storage of energy. Those materials
have limitations too, specifically low specific capacitance value
and low energy density. Energy density (E = 0.5CV2; C = specific capacitance
value and V = voltage window) of an energy storage
device can be increased by two ways, either by increasing the specific
capacitance value or by increasing the voltage window or both.2−4 Hence, scientists started working on transition metal oxides (TMOs)
or transition metal hydroxides (TMHs) or mixed transition metal oxides
(MTMOs) as an electrode material for energy storage, which is termed
as the pseudocapacitor.5−11 In most cases, energy has been stored, exploiting the surface redox
reactions of the electrode materials. Because of the fast faradic
redox reaction on the surface, theoretically though these compounds
exhibit a high specific capacitance value, in practice, they do not
exhibit such a high value and fall flat. The thickness of the electrode
material limits the electrolyte ions to access all active sites of
the electrode material during the electrochemical reaction.2−11 Thus, morphology is an important factor for TMOs/TMHs/MTMOs to behave
as an advance pseudocapacitor.2−15 This problem can be solved by using a material of two-dimensional
(2D) morphology.2−11 Aqueous electrolyte ions can penetrate up to 20 nm of an electrode
material.2−4 Thus, if an ultrathin 2D material can be used as
an electrode material for an energy storage device, it can participate
through its whole body during the electrochemical reaction. Simultaneously,
fast ion transportation through the electrode material can also increase
the rate capability as well as cyclic durability of the energy storage
device.16,17 Another problem with most of the pseudocapacitors
is that they exhibit a small potential window during the electrochemical
reaction in an aqueous electrolyte.

Therefore, in the last few
years, scientists have been working
on an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) where two materials of different
working potentials are judiciously coupled together resulting in a
broadened voltage window.2−11 A large voltage window provides a high energy density.2−15 Thus, both the positive electrode (mainly pseudocapacitors) and
negative electrode (generally carbonaceous materials, but sometimes
V2O5, MoO3, and Fe-oxides) in combination
play a crucial role in the energy storage activity of the ASC.18−20 Because of the high ionic mobility, low cost, and safety issues,
scientists are more interested in the aqueous electrolyte.2−20 Binary metal cobaltites (MCo2O4, M = Ni, Mn,
Zn etc.) are widely used as popular pseudocapacitors.21−25 Among them, NiCo2O4 is a well-documented one
as both Ni and Co exhibit more than one oxidation state. In most cases,
NiCo2O4 has been chosen as a positive electrode
in the ASC because of its interconnected structure, which contemplates
high electrical conductivity and high electrochemical activity.21−30 Several morphologies (nanosheet, nanowire, nanoflake, mesoporous
etc.) of NiCo2O4 have been studied so far to
fabricate an advance pseudocapacitor electrode.23−30 But in most of the cases, bare NiCo2O4 does
not perform well to exhibit the expected result. As for example, Zhang
and Lou reported NiCo2O4 of nanorod and nanosheet
morphologies, which exhibited specific capacitance values of 905 and
889 F/g at 2 A/g specific current, respectively.29 Some researchers have also studied the composite of NiCo2O4 with carbon dots, graphene, and so forth, and
some have also prepared some heterostructures of NiCo2O4 with the addition of other materials or NiCo2O4 itself to fabricate a pseudocapacitor of high energy density
with excellent rate capability and cyclic durability to meet the demand.24 There is a report where Liu et al. have synthesized
NiCo2O4@NiCo2O4 core–shell
nanoflake arrays for high-performance supercapacitors. They reported
maximum areal specific capacitance of 2.20 F/cm2 at a discharge
current of 5 mA/cm2.24 Till
now, several groups have reported the pseudocapacitance activity of
the NiCo2O4 nanosheet.26−30 Few researchers have got excellent result also.27 For example, Du and co-workers prepared the
NiCo2O4 nanosheet over a flexible carbon fiber,
which displayed very high specific capacitance value of 2658 F/g at
2 A/g specific current.27 But, in most
of the cases, nanosheets were of short sizes with an aggregated surface,
which limits their electrochemical activity.26−30 Though several studies have been done on the 2D nanosheets
of NiCo2O4, yet synthesis of the large, flat,
and smooth surface of the NiCo2O4 nanosheet
is not an easy task. On the other hand, use of Fe3O4 as a negative electrode has drawn much attention of the researchers
because of its high over potential for the hydrogen evolution reaction.31−35 Environmental friendliness, low cost, and high abundance in the
earth’s crust make Fe3O4 an excellent
replacement for activated carbon for a negative electrode.31−35 However, low electrical conductivity is a major concern for Fe3O4 to be used as a pseudocapacitive electrode.

Here, we present the synthesis of two different 2D NiCo2O4 nanostructures of high lateral size (micron level).
Both the 2D morphologies have been synthesized using two different
sets of precursor salts, resulting in two important materials. However,
in both the cases, ammonia is used as the hydrolyzing agent. Both
the materials exhibited excellent electrochemical activity. For the
sake of complete assembly, we have also synthesized rGO@Fe3O4 composites of different compositions. During the fabrication
of the ASC, based on the range of electrochemical activities, NiCo2O4 nanostructures and the rGO@Fe3O4 composite have been co-jointly considered as the positive
electrode and negative electrode, respectively.

Results and Discussion
Positive
Electrode
Here we used two different 2D NiCo2O4 nanostructure materials as positive electrodes
for the ASC; one is NiCo2O4 nanosheet (NCS)
and another is NiCo2O4 nanoplate (NCP). For
the synthesis of NCS, we used cobalt sulfate (CoSO4·7H2O) and nickel acetate [Ni(OOCCH3)2·4H2O] as precursor salts, and for NCP, nickel nitrate [Ni(NO3)2·6H2O] and cobalt nitrate [Co(NO3)2·6H2O] were used (Figure 1). In both the cases, ammonia
was used as the hydrolyzing agent. In our previous study, we have
discussed how ammonia supports the evolution of the 2D morphology
of TMOs and TMHs.2,3 Here also, the different hydrogen-bonding
ability of ammonia with different metal ions and the anisotropic growth-oriented
attachment under vigorous reaction conditions guided the formation
of 2D mixed TMOs.2,3

Figure 1 Pictorial presentation of the synthesis
of NCS and NCP samples.

Different physical methods have been used for the characterization
of the as-synthesized samples. Figure 2a exhibits the powdered X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra
of the two samples. In both the cases, the XRD patterns are in good
agreement with the JCPDS file no. 73-1702, which is of cubic lattice
with the Fd3m space group of the
nickel cobaltite (NiCo2O4) spinel structure.26 Compositional analysis of the energy-dispersive
X-ray (EDX) spectra indicates the presence of Ni, Co, and O in both
the as-synthesized samples (Figure S1a,b). Quantitative analysis of the EDX for both the samples reveals
that the stoichiometric ratio of Ni/Co/O is 1:2:4, which is also in
agreement with the XRD analysis of the samples. X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy analysis points out the surface elemental composition
and oxidation state of the as-prepared two samples. Figure 1b exhibits the X-ray photoelectron
survey spectra of NCS and NCP, which also confirms the presence of
Ni, Co, and O in both the samples (C 1s has come from the reference).

Figure 2 Comparative

results of the NCS and NCP samples.

Deconvoluted XPS spectra (Figure 3a,b) reveal that in both the cases, Ni 2p
consists
of four peaks; 2p3/2, 2p1/2, and other two are
satellite peaks. For both the samples, Ni 2p3/2 and Ni
2p1/2 are situated at ∼855.6 and ∼872.8 eV,
respectively. Deconvoluted Co 2p (Figure 3c,d) also exhibits four peaks. For Co, 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 are situated at ∼780.2 and
∼795.8 eV, respectively. These experimental results are well
in agreement with the literature report of the binding energies for
these peaks, which indicate the formation of the cubic NiCo2O4 spinel structure.36 Deconvolution
of the O 1s (Figure 3e,f) spectra for both the samples consist of three peaks at ∼529.8,
∼531.4, and 533.7 eV, which signify the typical metal–oxygen
bond, oxygen ions at low coordination on the surface, and hydroxyl
group of the surface-adsorbed water molecules, respectively, for both
the as-synthesized samples.38 Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) images of the as-synthesized samples indicate
that both the materials are of thin 2D morphologies with lateral size
in the micron level. Figure 4a depicts the 2D thin nanosheet of the NiCo2O4 sample whose lateral size is greater than 1 μm (∼1.9
μm), and Figure 4b depicts the uniform 2D thin hexagonal nanoplate morphology of the
as-synthesized NiCo2O4, which is of ∼970
nm lateral size. Figure S2 displays the
field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images of the
two as-prepared samples, which also depict the 2D nanosheet and hexagonal
nanoplate morphology, respectively. Selected area electron diffraction
(SAED) patterns of the NCS and NCP samples specify the crystallinity
of the samples. The calculated lattice spacing from the SAED images
is in good agreement with the (311), (422), (511), and (220) planes
for the NCS sample (Figure 4c) and the (311), (422), and (220) planes for the NCP sample
(Figure 4d). These
results are well in agreement with the XRD of the samples. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) study reveals that both the materials are mesoporous in nature,
which is an important parameter for an electrode to behave as an advance
pseudocapacitor. Figure S3a,c demonstrates
the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm curves for
the NCS and NCP samples, respectively, at a relative pressure from
0.1 to 1 (P/P0). The
calculated BET surface areas for the NCS and NCP samples are 99 and
115 m2/g, respectively. Figure S3b,d displays the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda pore size distribution
curves, where we can see that the pore diameter for NCS is 3.8 nm
and that for NCP is 3.4 nm. These results clearly indicate the mesoporous
nature of the samples. The pore volumes of NCS and NCP are 0.282 and
0.339 cm3/g, respectively.

We have tested the half-cell
electrochemical activities of the
samples (NCS and NCP) in a three-electrode system using a 3 M aqueous
solution of KOH as the electrolyte. Figure 5 exhibits a series of cyclic voltammetric
(CV) curves and ch–dch curves of the NCS and NCP samples at
different scan rates and different specific currents, respectively,
between −0.1 and 0.4 V relative to the saturated calomel electrode
(SCE). In both the cases, the CV curves are peak-shaped, which indicate
the pseudocapacitive nature of the electrodes (Figure 5a,b). The almost symmetric ch–dch
curves point to the excellent kinetic reversibility of the samples
during the electrochemical reactions [Co(II) ↔ Co(III) ↔
Co(IV)]. We calculated the specific capacitance values of the samples
from the ch–dch curves (Figure 5c,d). At 1 A/g specific current, the specific capacitance
values of NCS and NCP are 1540 and 1333 F/g, respectively. Here, it
is observed that the specific capacitance value of NCS is greater
than that of NCP. This is because the thickness of NCP is ∼75
nm and that of NCS is <20 nm (Figure S2). Thus, NCS offers more redox active sites than NCP during the electrochemical
reaction. We calculated the specific capacitance values at different
specific currents and different scan rates to explore the rate capability
of the as-prepared material. Figure S4a,b displays the plot of specific capacitance values of NCS and NCP
samples as a function of specific currents and scan rates, which indicates
the superior rate capability of the samples. Compared to the reported
specific capacitance values of different NiCo2O4 nanosheets, it can be concluded that the as-synthesized NCS and
NCP exhibit excellent electrochemical activities (Table S1). We performed the ch–dch experiments for
both samples up to 10 000 cycles at 30 A/g specific current. Figure 5e,f exhibits the
graphical presentation of the experimental results for the cyclic
performances. Here, we can see that after 10 000 cycles, the
NCS and NCP samples kept their initial specific capacitance up to
89 and 81%, respectively, at such a high specific current. Figure 5e,f also reveals
that after 10 000 cycles, the Coulombic efficiency of the NCS
and NCP samples are 98 and 93%, respectively, which indicates the
superb kinetic reversibility of the electrode material. The excellent
electrochemical activity of the electrode materials could be explained,
considering their morphology and structural features. First, both
the materials bear a high lateral size with thin and flat surfaces,
which offer maximum active sites during the redox reactions that increase
the specific capacitance value largely. Additionally, the thin wall
of both the materials facilitates the first charge transportation
and excels ion diffusion, which increase the rate capability of the
material. Furthermore, the mesoporous nature and high pore volume
increase the wettability of the electrode materials, which also facilitates
the fast ion transportation through the material during electrochemical
reactions. On the other hand, NiCo2O4 with its
mixed oxide structure increases the electrical conductivity and physical
robustness. This physical robustness supports material prevention
and inhibits physical degradation during the ch–dch cycles
at high specific currents, which have clearly been observed from our
experimental results. To support these discussions, we performed electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy. Figure S4c,d exhibits
the electrochemical impedance spectra () of the NCS and NCP samples
before and after 10 000 ch–dch cycles. From Table S2, it is observed that the values of RS (internal resistance), RCT (charge transfer resistance), and W (diffusive
resistance) for NCS are lower than those for NCP. This also justifies
the high specific capacitance value of NCS than that of NCP. Again,
before and after 10 000 cycles, both the samples maintain excellent
stability. There is no such significant change in RS and RCT values after stability
performance for the NCS sample. The only significant change is for W. For NCP, the differences are not very high, but larger
compared to NCS. This also supports the high stability of NCS over
NCP.

curves of the NCP and NCS samples.

Negative Electrode
To fabricate an advance ASC, a suitable
negative electrode is also an important factor. Here we prepared the
rGO@Fe3O4 composite (GFe), which at a suitable
mass-loading of Fe3O4 behaves as an excellent
pseudocapacitor electrode. We synthesized Fe3O4 nanocubes using an alternative redox pathway, which has been developed
by our group.38 We prepared several composites
(GFe1, GFe2, GFe3, and GFe4) by varying the Mohr’s salt concentration, keeping the amount
of GO fixed. We performed the electrochemical analysis using all these
four composites, and it was found the GFe2 exhibits the
best pseudocapacitance activity (discussed later). Hence, we performed
all experiments using GFe2 as the standard composite and
mentioned as GFe in the whole manuscript. Figure 6a illustrates the comparative XRD spectra
of GO, Fe3O4 cube, and the rGO@Fe3O4 (GFe) composite. A broad peak at 10.3° in the
spectrum in blue is the characteristic peak for GO. In black, most
of the distinct peaks arise from Fe3O4 [JCPDS
no. 86-1362, magnetite, face-centered cubic lattice, cell parameter a = 8.396 Å, space group Fd3m (227)], which are in good agreement with the spectrum
in red (which stands for the pure Fe3O4 nanocube)
and the literature report.38 A broad hump
is observed at around 23°, which is due to the formation of reduced
GO (rGO). An interesting fact is that no peak at 10.3° is observed,
which confirms the transformation of GO to rGO. Thus, from the above
discussion, it is clear that the as-prepared composite is an exclusive
rGO@Fe3O4 composite.

Figure 6 (a) Comparative XRD curves
of GO, GFe, and Fe3O4, (b) FESEM, and (c) TEM
images of GFe samples.

To complete the compositional investigation of the composite,
we
performed the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. Figure S5a depicts the wide-range XPS of the
composite, where all characteristic peaks for Fe, O, and C were observed. Figure S5b exhibits the high-resolution XPS of
Fe. The peak positions at 711.9 eV (Fe 2p3/2) and 725.6
eV (Fe 2p1/2) confirm the formation of Fe3O4 in the system, which is in good agreement with the literature
value.38 The deconvoluted C 1s spectrum
is composed of four peaks, which are situated at 284.6, 286.6, 287.7,
and 288.57 eV (FigureS5c). The peak at
284.6 eV stands for the sp2 C.4 The other peaks define that even after thermal reduction, the rGO
state contains some oxygen-containing groups (286.6 eV for the −C–O
bond, 287.7 eV for the −C=O bond, and 288.57 eV for
the −C(O)O bond). Figure S5d demonstrates
the high-resolution XPS of O 1s positioned at 531 eV, which is due
to the Fe–O bond. The above discussion confirms the formation
of the rGO@Fe3O4 composite (GFe).

We performed
Raman analysis to confirm the transformation of GO
to rGO. Figure S6a,b exhibits the Raman
spectra of pure GO and the GFe composite. In both the spectra, two
major peaks were observed at ∼1592 and ∼1351 cm–1, which are referred as the G band and D band, respectively.
In the case of GO (Figure S6a), ID/IG is 0.94, and
for the rGO@Fe3O4 composite, it is 1.14 (Figure S6b), which confirms the transformation
of GO to rGO during the synthesis of the Fe3O4-based composite. Here, the D band stands for the disorder and defect
in the atomic arrangement, and the G band stands for the plane vibrations
of the sp2 hybridized carbon atom of the 2D layer.4 This clearly confirms the transformation of GO
to rGO during the hydrothermal reaction.

To identify the morphology
of the as-synthesized composite, we
performed the FESEM and high-resolution TEM analyses. Figure 6b,c exhibits the FESEM and
TEM images of the GFe sample, where we can see small Fe3O4 nanocube decoration over the rGO surface. Figure 7 displays the FESEM
and TEM images of all different rGO@Fe3O4 composites
of various compositions (GFe1, GFe2, GFe3, and GFe4). From Figure 7, it is clear that the Fe3O4 nanocubes decorate the flat 2D rGO sheet, and as the concentration
of the Mohr’s salt is increased, the distribution of nanocubes
over the 2D rGO increases. For GFe1, most of the rGO surface
lies vacant (Figure 7a,e). Again, for GFe3 and GFe4, we observe
that Fe3O4 is randomly distributed over the
rGO surface, which causes aggregation of the nanocubes (Figure 7c,d,g,h). But, for GFe2, the Fe3O4 nanocubes are uniformly
distributed all over the flat rGO surface (Figure 7b,f). To study the morphology of the pure
Fe3O4 nanocubes, we use the same procedure without
using GO. Figure S7a exhibits the FESEM
images of pure Fe3O4 nanocubes. Figure S7b exhibits the FESEM image of pure rGO.
Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry was used to quantify
the amount of Fe3O4 in the composites, and it
was found that Fe3O4 loading in GFe1, GFe2, GFe3, and GFe4 are 42, 61,
79, and 81%, respectively.

of rGO@Fe3O4 nanoparticles with increasing concentration

salt.

Electrochemical activities were
carried out for all composites
in the three-electrode system using the KOH electrolyte. Figure 8a shows the series
of CV curves for the GFe composite in the potential range of −1.2
to 0 V, where a pair of redox peaks in the region of −0.7 to
−1.2 V is observed because of the reversible faradaic redox
transformation between Fe2+ & Fe3+.4,27−30 We calculated the specific capacitance value of the composite from
the ch–dch curves at different specific currents (Figure 8b). The calculated
specific capacitance values of the GFe composite are 890 and 252 F/g
at 2 and 50 A/g specific currents, respectively. We also calculated
the specific capacitance value of the GFe composite at different scan
rates (Figure S8a). Figures 8c and S8a demonstrate
the specific capacitance values of the GFe composite at different
specific currents and scan rates. These results clearly reveal that
the GFe composite possesses excellent rate capability. We also scrutinized
the pseudocapacitance activity of the other three samples, and Figure 8c displays the plot
of specific capacitance values of the composites as a function of
the specific current. From this figure, it can be concluded that 61%
Fe3O4 loading is optimum for the composite to
behave as a stable, high rate capable pseudocapacitor. Comparison
to the ch–dch curves of pure Fe3O4 nanocube
and rGO (Figure S8b) also indicates that
because of the synergistic effect between Fe3O4 and rGO in the composite, GFe exhibits better electrochemical activity.
We performed 10 000 ch–dch cycles at 40 A/g specific
current, and it was observed that the composite maintained 90% of
its original specific capacitance values after such a large number
of cycles and also maintained ∼98% Coulombic efficiency (Figure S8c). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
analysis also supports the high electrochemical performance of the
GFe composite. Figure S8d exhibits the
EIS of the GFe composite before and after 10 000 ch–dch
cycles, which support the stability of the composite after the cycles.
From the above discussion, it is clear that rGO plays an important
role in the fabrication of a stable electrode, and the proportion
of composition in the composite has a major contribution during the
electrochemical activity.4

ch–dch curves of the GFe sample, respectively.

of specific current.

To evaluate the practical utility of the above-mentioned
materials,
we fabricated two aqueous ASCs using NCS and NCP as positive electrodes
separately and GFe as a negative electrode in 3 M KOH electrolyte. Figure S9a demonstrates the comparative CV curves
of NCS, NCP, and GFe at 50 mV/s, which suggests that the maximum voltage
window for the ASCs can be 1.6 V. Figure 9a,c represents the CV curves of NCS//GFe
and NCP//GFe cells at different scan rates, respectively. Figure 9b,d corresponds to
the ch–dch curves of NCS//GFe and NCP//GFe cells at different
specific currents, respectively. The shapes of the CV curves are well-maintained
even at very high scan rates, which suggest very fast and reversible
reaction kinetics. We calculated the specific capacitance values of
the asymmetric cells using ch–dch curves and CV curves. Figure 9e,f demonstrates
the plot of specific capacitance values as a function of specific
currents and scan rates for both the two-electrode systems. From Figure 9e,f, it is clear
that both the two-electrode cell is highly rate capable. Here, it
is observed that NCS//GFe and NCP//GFe exhibit specific capacitance
values of 505 and 406 F/g at a specific current of 1 A/g, respectively.
Again at 12 A/g specific current, the values are 316 and 252 F/g,
respectively. These results suggest that after a 12-fold increase
in the current, both the asymmetric cells exhibit a rate capability
of ∼62%, which is an extraordinary result for a two-electrode
system. To confirm the reversibility, we calculated the Coulombic
efficiency (η) at different currents for both the cells, and
it was found that even at a low specific current, Coulombic efficiency
is ∼100% for both the cells. Figure S9b shows that NCS//GFe maintained its stability up to 86% after 10 000
ch–dch cycles, whereas the stability of NCP//GFe (Figure S9c) is 84%. These results stand for the
excellent cyclic durability of the asymmetric cells. We also calculated
the Coulombic efficiency in each cycle, and Figure S9b,c shows that both cells maintained it up to 10 000
cycles. Figure 10a
displays the Ragone plot for the NCS//GFe and NCP//GFe cells, where
both the cells exhibit a high specific energy with a high specific
power. The NCS//GFe cell shows a maximum specific energy of 44.89
W h/kg at a specific power of 800 W/kg (discharge time 202 s, specific
current 1 A/g) and a maximum specific power of 15 362 W/kg
at a specific energy of 24.41 W h/kg (discharge time 5.72 s, specific
current 12 A/g). For the NCP//GFe cell, the maximum specific energy
is 42.5 W h/kg at a specific power of 1279 W/kg (discharge time 120
s, specific current 1 A/g) and the maximum specific power is 12 789
W/kg at a specific energy of 22.43 W h/kg (discharge time 6.31 s,
specific current 12 A/g). These results clearly reveal that both the
asymmetric cells can store very high energy without sacrificing the
power, which is utmost important for an advance energy storage device. Table S3 also reveals that compared to the reported
Ni–Co and Fe-based asymmetric supercapacitor, these two asymmetric
cells exhibit a better energy storage and delivery capability. To
support the superiority of the asymmetric cells, we performed electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy analysis for both the two-electrode cells at
the initial and after 10 000 ch–dch cycles (Figure 10b,c). From the
plot, it is clear that in both cases, there is not enough change in
the RS and RCT values (Table S4) after the cyclic experiments
for both the cells. The only changes are in the diffusive resistance,
which was increased after 10 000 cycles. This is the reason
for the capacity fade after the cyclic treatment. Figure 10d exhibits the Bode plot for
the as-fabricated asymmetric cell, where we found that for NCS//GFe,
the phase angle at 0.01 Hz is −73 and for NCP//GFe, it is −70,
suggesting the capacitive property of the systems. Another important
parameter for an energy storage device is the relaxation time (τ0, τ0 = 1/f0, f0 = frequency at −45°), which stands
for the low charging time for a supercapacitor to attain its maximum
specific capacitance value. For NCS//GFe and NCP//GFe, the values
of τ0 are ∼1 and ∼1.26 s, respectively,
which also support the high specific energy and specific power of
the asymmetric sample.

Conclusions
In summary, two as-fabricated two-electrode
electrochemical systems
are reported, and they are proved to be excellent ASCs because of
their high specific energy, specific power, and extraordinary rate.
High electrochemical performances of the as-fabricated large 2D NiCo2O4 nanostructures ensure to be the ideal candidate
for the positive electrode in an asymmetric cell. The large surface
of the 2D NiCo2O4 provides innumerable active
sites, and the thin wall shortens the diffusion path, which augments
the electrochemical activities of both the as-synthesized samples.
The large potential window and stability of the rGO@Fe3O4 composite (at an appropriate composition) offers an
alternative negative electrode for the two-electrode system. rGO present
in the composite enhances the electrical conductivity of the composite,
which also overcomes the stability issue of the Fe3O4 electrode as a pseudocapacitor. The above discussion reveals
that the above-mentioned asymmetric cells could be an ideal combination
for hybrid energy storage devices for future application.

Synthesis of 2D NiCo2O4 Nanostructures
NCS
First, a mixture of 5 mL of 0.05 M Ni(OAc)2·4H2O and 10 mL of 0.05 M CoSO4·7H2O aqueous solution was prepared. The mixture
was then taken in a 100 mL beaker, and 5 mL of 2% (w/v) aqueous solution
of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) was added slowly. The resulting mixture
was stirred for 4 h. Then, the mixture was taken in a 15 mL screw
cap test tube (10 mL in each test tube). An aliquot of 400 μL
liquor ammonia solution was injected into the solution and shaken
to make the reaction mixture homogeneous. After that, the test tube
containing the reaction mixture was capped and subjected to modified
hydrothermal treatment (MHT) at 180 °C. After 24 h of heating,
the obtained product was centrifuged and washed with distilled water
and then with ethanol to remove all impurities. Finally, the product
was dried under vacuum and stored.

NCP
First, a mixture
of 5 mL of 0.05 M Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and 10 mL of 0.05 M Co(NO3)2·6H2O aqueous solution was prepared.
The mixture was then taken in a 100 mL beaker, and 5 mL of 2% (w/v)
aqueous solution of PVP was added slowly. The resulting mixture was
stirred for 4 h. Then, the mixture was taken in a 15 mL screw cap
test tube (10 mL in each test tube). An aliquot of 400 μL liquor
ammonia solution was injected into the solution and shaken to make
the reaction mixture homogeneous. After that, the test tube containing
the reaction mixture was subjected to MHT at 180 °C. After 24
h of heating, the obtained product was centrifuged and washed with
distilled water and then with ethanol to remove all impurities. Finally,
the product was dried under vacuum and stored.

Synthesis of
the rGO@Fe3O4 Composite
We synthesized
GO from graphite using the Hummers method. Briefly,
pristine graphite was taken as the precursor and was oxidized by strong
oxidizing agents, KMnO4, NaNO3, and concentrated
H2SO4. After that, H2O2 was added to the mixture to remove the excess KMnO4 and
to convert the generated MnO2 to MnSO4. Then,
it was washed with hot water and air-dried. After that, 50 mg of the
solid material was dispersed with 50 mL of distilled water through
sonication for 3 h, and then it was centrifuged for 30 min at 3000
rpm speed for washing. Finally, the solid solution was taken and used
for the preparation of different rGO@Fe3O4 composites.

Afterward, 20 mL of Mohr’s solution of different concentrations
(0.025, 0.05, 0.075, and 0.125 M) were dissolved into the above suspensions
and stirred for 24 h. Then, hot distilled water was added to the reaction
mixture, and excess NaBH4 was added to the solution. The
beaker with the reaction mixture was placed on a piece of door magnet
so that the reaction evolved the iron/GO composite, which was adhered
to the bottom of the beaker and could not come in contact with the
air–water interface. The freshly prepared composites were washed
with distilled water. Then 50 mL of 2% PVP solution was added to the
beaker and subjected to MHT at 180 °C for 24 h. Here, the product
appeared as a black precipitate, which was washed very carefully first
with distilled water and then with ethanol, so that all PVP was removed
from the surface of the composite.

Fabrication of Electrode
for the Electrochemical Supercapacitor
The electrochemical
measurements for both the samples, NCS and
NCP, were carried out using the three-electrode system at room temperature.
Aqueous 3 M KOH solution was used as the electrolyte. Electrochemical
studies were carried out by cyclic voltammetry, chronopotentiometry
or galvanostatic charge–discharge, and electrochemical impedance
spectroscopic technique. We used Ni foam as the current collector.
Ni foam was first treated with 6 M HCl, followed by washing with ethanol
and water. Then it was dried. For electrode fabrication, first we
dispersed the as-synthesized samples, NCS and NCP (separately), acetylene
black, and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) in the N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone solvent in the weight ratio of 85:10:5. Then,
the as-obtained slurry was pasted on 1 × 1 cm2 activated
Ni foam using a spatula. After that, the electrodes were dried at
120 °C for 12 h. These electrodes were used as the working electrode.
Pt wire and SCE were used as the counter and reference electrode,
respectively. Before starting the experiments, the electrodes were
dipped in 3 M KOH electrolyte for 15 min. All electrochemical measurements
were carried out using the CHI 660E electrochemical workstation. The
weight of the working electrode was 1.5 mg (excluding the weight of
acetylene black and the PVDF binder).

For the GFe composite,
we used the same procedure as mentioned above. We used GFe instead
of NCS or NCP. The weight of the working electrode was also 1.5 mg
(excluding the weight of acetylene black and the PVDF binder).

Asymmetric
Cell
For the fabrication of the ASC, NCS
and NCP were used as the positive electrode separately, and GFe was
used as the negative electrode. Pt wire was used as the connector
between the electrode and the instrument. A dielectric Whatman filter
paper was used as the separator. KOH (3 M) was used as the electrolyte.
Here, because of the different specific capacitance values of the
positive electrodes, mass balance is necessary to get the maximum
activity of the asymmetric cell. The mass balance is calculated using
the equation 1  where Q+ and Q– signify the charge on the positive
and negative electrodes, respectively. Again 2  where CSC, m, and ΔE signify the specific capacitance
value, mass of the active material in the electrode, and the working
potential of the ch–dch curve, respectively. Now, comparing eqs 1 and 2, we get 3  Here, for NCS//GFe, the mass ratio of the
positive and negative electrode is (NCS/GFe) 1.4:1. For NCP//GFe,
the ratio is (NCP/GFe) 2:1. The weight of the active material in the
complete cell is 3 mg (excluding the weight of acetylene black and
the PVDF binder).
