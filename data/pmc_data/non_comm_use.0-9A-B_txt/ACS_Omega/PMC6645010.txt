A metal- and base-free
method is developed for the synthesis of aryl iodides from arylhydrazine
hydrochlorides and iodine. A wide variety of aryl iodides can be conveniently
synthesized by an equimolar reaction of arylhydrazine hydrochlorides
and I2 in dimethyl sulfoxide at 60 °C for 6 h. In
the iodination step, arylhydrazines are oxidized by iodine to form
arenediazonium salts, which undergo single-electron transfer from
iodide anion to give aryl and iodine radicals; subsequent combination
of them affords the corresponding aryl iodides.

Introduction
Aryl iodides are important
synthetic building blocks in organic chemistry that are mainly used
for cross-coupling and related reactions,1 such as the Mizoroki–Heck reaction,2 Sonogashira coupling,3 Suzuki–Miyaura
cross-coupling,4 and Ullmann condensation.5 Besides, aryl iodides are employed in metal–iodine
exchange using organometallic reagents such as Grignard reagents6 and in halogen exchange via the halogenation
of diaryliodonium salts with cuprous halides.7 In addition, hypervalent iodine compounds, which are important oxidizing
agents, are usually synthesized from aryl iodides.8 Furthermore, arenes bearing radioactive iodine isotopes
(123I, 124I, 125I, and 131I) play an important role in labeling biomacromolecules, such as
proteins, nucleic acids, and cell surfaces in nuclear medicine and
radiotherapy science.9

Over the past
several decades, many methodologies for aromatic iodination have been
developed: (1) direct aromatic iodination with I2 or other
iodination reagents such as N-iodosuccinimide;10 (2) aromatic iodination by using activated precursors
such as aryl boronic acid,11 aryl triflates,12 phenylazocarboxylates,13 aryl carboxylic acids,14 potassium aryltrifluoroborates,15 and aryl diazonium salts;16 (3) halogen exchange via an aromatic Finkelstein reaction.17 Among these, the Sandmeyer reaction is a classical
reaction that proceeds via the diazotization of aromatic amines, followed
by iodination with iodides (Scheme 1, eq 1). This method does not require transition metals;
however, nitrous acid, which is highly corrosive, and a strongly acidic
medium, such as sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, or tetrafluoroboric
acid are inevitable for the diazotization step.18 Therefore, developing a facile approach to generate diazonium
salts without transition metals, corrosive acids, and harsh oxidants
or reductants is highly desirable.

Scheme 1 Aromatic Iodination
Recently, we used commercially available arylhydrazine
hydrochlorides as the source of aryl radicals and successfully achieved
the arylation of aminoheterocycles and aromatic diamines, as well
as the synthesis of unsymmetrical diaryl sulfides and selenides (Scheme 1, eq 2).19 Inspired by the results, we explored the reaction
of arylhydrazines with iodine to synthesize aryl iodides (Scheme 1, eq 3). Joshi’s
group reported a similar method (Scheme 1, eq 4), but it is applicable only to nitrophenylhydrazines
and afforded the corresponding products in moderate yields (54–68%).20 By contrast, our method requires mild conditions,
has a much broader substrate scope, and tolerates a wide range of
functional groups; further, the desired aryl iodides are formed in
good to excellent yields (74–95%). Besides, compared to the
Sandmeyer reaction, our protocol is safer, easier to execute, involves
simpler work-up, and has higher efficiency.

Results and Discussion
Initially, the cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3)/dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) system, which was used for the generation of aryl
radicals in our previous work,19 was employed
for the present iodination reaction. 4-Chlorophenylhydrazine hydrochloride
(1a, 0.5 mmol) was chosen as the model substrate for
reaction with I2 (1.0 equiv) in the presence of Cs2CO3 (1.0 equiv) as the base and DMSO as the solvent
in the air, and 1-chloro-4-iodobenzene 2a was obtained
in 63% yield (Table 1, entry 1). A lower or higher reaction temperature (40 or 80 °C)
gave 2a in reduced yield (Table 1, entry 1, footnotes c and d). Screening
of the solvent effects demonstrated that DMSO was the best solvent
for this iodination (Table 1, entries 2–8). Increasing the amount of I2 (2.0 equiv) failed to improve the yield of 2a (Table 1, entry 9). A higher
concentration of reactants led to the slightly improved yield of 2a (Table 1, entry 10), but the exorbitant reaction concentration with the same
equivalent of Cs2CO3 was sluggish for the generation
of 2a (Table 1, entry 11). Interestingly, a greater amount of Cs2CO3 hindered the formation of 2a (Table 1, entry 12), and conversely,
the reaction without the base afforded 2a in 54% yield
(Table 1, entry 13).
Encouraged by this result, we hypothesized that no additional base
was required for the generation of aryl radicals in this reaction,
as opposed to our previous work.19 Hence,
we further optimized the iodination conditions in the absence of the
base. As expected, the use of 2.0 equiv of I2 gave 2a in 84% yield (Table 1, entry 14). A shorter reaction time furnished 2a in a similar yield (Table 1, entry 14, footnote e), whereas a longer reaction time lowered
the yield of 2a slightly (Table 1, entry 14, footnote f). Moreover, upon reducing
the amount of DMSO to 0.1 mL, the desired product 2a was
furnished in 92% yield (Table 1, entry 15). With this substrate concentration, the use of
the same equivalent of iodine gave 2a in 92% yield (Table 1, entry 16), which
was chosen as the optimized condition for this iodination reaction.
Under the optimized condition, a clear dark red solution was formed
and gas bubbles appeared. After the reaction was finished, the color
of iodine does not disappear and the resulting mixture caused a foul
odor, suggests the formation of dimethyl sulfide. Further decreasing
the concentration (equivalents) of iodine gave 2a in
a slightly reduced yield (Table 1, entry 17).

g In this reaction, azide and aniline,
besides aryl iodide, were generated as byproducts. After the reaction,
arylhydrazine was already consumed but I2 was not consumed.
Most probably, air acted as an oxidant for this iodination.

h Iodine not only acts as iodination reagent
but also oxidizes phenylhydrazines to diazonium salt, and therefore
excessive iodine is more beneficial to the iodination.

With the optimized reaction conditions
in hand (Table 1, entry
16), we next investigated a series of phenylhydrazine hydrochlorides
to synthesize aryl iodides (Table 2). First, substrates with a chloro-substituent at the
para-, ortho-, and meta-positions were examined and the corresponding
aryl iodides were isolated in high yields (Table 2, 2a–2c).
Substrates with other halo-substituents (iodo, bromo, and fluoro)
at the para-position were also tested under these reaction conditions; 2d and 2e were formed in high yields, but the
volatile product 2f was generated in somewhat low isolated
yield. A similar scenario was encountered during the purification
of iodobenzene, which decreased the yield of the isolated product 2g (70% yield). Substrates with a methyl-substituent at the
ortho-, meta-, and para-position, and an ethyl-substituent at the
ortho-position gave the corresponding aryl iodides 2h–2k in good to excellent yields. The reaction
of 4-methoxyphenylhydrazine hydrochloride gave the product 2l in 90% yield. Besides, a gram-scale iodination of 4-methoxyphenylhydrazine
hydrochloride was performed under the standard conditions (Table 2, 2lb) and 1.44 g (6.15 mmol, 88% isolated yield)
of 2l was formed from 7 mmol of the starting compound
(1.22 g). 3-Methoxy- and 2-methoxy substituents were also tolerated
under these reaction conditions (Table 2, 2m and 2n). Substrates
with electron-withdrawing groups such as the nitro group at the ortho-,
meta-, and para-positions (1o–1q),
as well as 4-trifluoromethyl (1s), 4-cyano (1t), and 4-carboxyl (1v) moieties could be iodinated to
afford the corresponding products in good to excellent yields. 4-Isopropylphenylhydrazine
hydrochloride also afforded 2r in excellent yield. Furthermore,
2-iodonaphthalene 2u was generated in good yield under
these iodination conditions but the formation of 2-iodopyridine 2w did not proceed well probably due to the presence
of the basic pyridyl group. Disubstituted substrates, i.e., substrates
with 3,5-dichloro-, 2,4-dichloro-, 3,4-dichloro-, and 2,4-dinitro
substituents, could be employed under the standard reaction conditions
to afford the desired products in good to excellent yields (Table 2, 2x–2a′). Unfortunately, when an aliphatic hydrazine such
as tert-butylhydrazine hydrochloride was employed
as substrate, 2b′ was not formed under the standard
condition.

b Gram scale.

c DMSO (0.2 mL) was used.

For a better understanding of this iodination reaction,
several control experiments were conducted, as shown in Scheme 2 (eqs 5–12). During
the optimization of the reaction conditions, we found that 1-azido-4-chlorobenzene 3 and 4-chloroaniline 4 were generated as byproducts
in the presence of a base (Scheme 2, eq 5). Under the standard reaction conditions, when
the amount of I2 was decreased to 0.1 mmol, aryl iodide 2a, azide 3, aniline 4, and dimethyl
sulfide 5 were detected by 1H NMR analysis
of the crude mixture. Besides, the formation of azide 3 and aniline 4 could be further confirmed by gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry (Scheme 2, eq 6). As well known, DMSO can oxidize hydrogen iodide to iodine,
whereas dimethyl sulfide is generated as the reduction product.21 Therefore, we speculated that hydrogen iodide
may be generated during this iodination, which further confirms that
acidic conditions favor this reaction. To clarify the role of DMSO
in the iodination reaction, dimethylformamide was used as the solvent
in combination with 0.5 mmol DMSO (Scheme 2, eq 7); 86% of 2a was formed
along with 0.17 mmol of dimethyl sulfide 5 (which was
detected by the crude 1H NMR spectra), whereas DMSO was
not detected after the iodination reaction was finished. The reaction
with 0.5 mmol of tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBuOOH) as an oxidant instead of DMSO also
afforded 2a in 80% yield (Scheme 2, eq 8). In contrast, the iodination in the
absence of DMSO only yielded 26% of 2a (Scheme 2, eq 9). These results suggest
that DMSO acted as not only solvent but also co-oxidant during the
iodination reaction: comparing the results of eqs 7, 9, and 11, DMSO
seems to be the major oxidant in this iodination reaction. In addition,
when the radical scavenger (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxyl
was added to the reaction mixture under the standard conditions (Scheme 2, eq 10), 2a was formed in a low yield with 10% of 6, which implies
that the iodination proceeds through a free-radical pathway. Besides,
this reaction can proceed well under argon protection (Scheme 2, eq 11), suggesting that the
oxidation of arylhydrazine to aryl radical can proceed not only with
molecular oxygen but also iodine itself. Free 4-chlorophenylhydrazine 7 was also employed as a substrate for the iodination reaction
but only to generate 42% of 2a, which implied that acidic
condition is essential for stabilizing arylhydrazine under this iodination
reaction (Scheme 2,
eq 12).

Scheme 2 Control Experiments
On the basis of these control experiments, a mechanism
for the iodination is proposed, as shown in Scheme 3. Specifically, the starting material 1a produces the free 4-chlorophenylhydrazine 7, which reacts with iodine to afford intermediate 8.
Dehydroiodination of 8 leads to 9, which
further reacts with iodine to form 10. Charge transfer
of 10 affords diazonium salt 11, which upon
single-electron transfer (SET) and nitrogen release, generates phenyl
radical 12 and an iodine radical. The combination of
the phenyl and iodine radicals leads to the formation of aryl iodide 2a. Excess amount of 7 (free form) may react
with diazonium salt 11 to generate byproducts 3 and 4.22 During this iodination,
hydrogen iodide can be oxidized to iodine by DMSO with the release
of dimethyl sulfide.21

for the Synthesis of Aryl Iodides
Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a facile
and efficient method to synthesize aryl iodides from arylhydrazine
hydrochlorides and iodine in the absence of any metal catalysts and
additives. During this iodination, iodine plays a dual role: (1) an
oxidant for converting arylhydrazines to arenediazonium salts, which
subsequently undergo SET to form aryl radicals; (2) an iodination
reagent to afford aryl iodides. Arylhydrazine hydrochlorides with
a diverse range of functional groups are tolerated under these iodination
conditions, and the corresponding aryl iodides are obtained in good
to excellent yields. Further studies on halogenation of the arylhydrazine
hydrochlorides using other halogenation reagents are underway, and
the results will be reported in due course.

General
Remarks
Unless otherwise stated, all starting materials and solvents
were purchased from commercial sources and used without further purification. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on JEOL JNM-ECS400 (400 MHz) FT
NMR system or JEOL JNM-ECX400 (400 MHz) FT NMR system in CDCl3 and DMSO-d6 with Me4Si as an internal standard. 13C NMR spectra were recorded
on JEOL JNM-ECX400 (100 MHz) FT NMR or JEOL JNM-ECS400 (100 MHz) FT
NMR in CDCl3 and DMSO-d6.

General Procedure for the Synthesis of Aryl Iodides (2)
The desired arylhydrazine hydrochloride derivatives 1 (0.5 mmol), I2 (126.9 mg, 0.5 mmol), and DMSO
(0.1 mL) were added to a round-bottomed flask, and the reaction mixture
was stirred at 60 °C for 6 h under air. The resulting mixture
was cooled to room temperature and then sat. Na2S2O8 (aq, 5 mL) and water (10 mL) were added. The mixture
was extracted with CHCl3 (4 × 5 mL), dried over anhydrous
Na2SO4, and concentrated in vacuo. Finally,
the residue was purified by silica gel chromatography (eluent: hexane/ethyl
acetate) to give 2 (eluent for 2v: chloroform/methanol).

General Procedure for the
Gram-Scale Synthesis of 1-Iodo-4-methoxybenzene (2l)
4-Methoxyphenylhydrazine hydrochloride 1l (1.22 g,
7 mmol), I2 (1.80 g, 7 mmol), and DMSO (1.4 mL) were added
to a round-bottomed flask, and the reaction mixture was stirred at
60 °C for 6 h under air. The resulting mixture was cooled to
room temperature, and then sat. Na2S2O8 (aq, 25 mL) and water (100 mL) were added. The mixture was extracted
with CHCl3 (4 × 20 mL), dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and concentrated in vacuo. Finally, the residue
was purified by silica gel chromatography (eluent: hexane/ethyl acetate)
to give 2l (1.44 g).
