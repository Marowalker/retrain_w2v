Sensing of metal contaminants at ultralow concentrations
in aqueous environments is vital in today’s overpopulated world,
with an extremely stringent limit (<5 ppb) for Cd2+ ions
in drinking water. Here, we utilize sonochemically exfoliated molybdenum
disulfide (MoS2) nanosheets functionalized with l-cysteine (Cys) as highly sensitive and selective two-dimensional
(2D) materials for solid-state chemiresistors. We specifically targeted
Cd2+ ions due to their high toxicity at low concentrations.
MoS2-Cys nanosheets are fabricated using an ad hoc, low-complexity,
one-pot synthesis method. Porous MoS2–Cys thin films
with a high surface area are assembled from these nanosheets. Two-terminal
chemiresistors incorporating MoS2–Cys films are
demonstrated to be preferentially sensitive to Cd2+ ions
at neutral pH, irrespective of other metal ions present in water flowing
through the device. A 5 ppb concentration of the Cd2+ ions
in the water stream increases the device resistivity by 20 times.
Our devices operate at broad (1–500 ppb) range and fast (∼1
s) response times. Cd2+ is selectively detected because
of preferential, size-driven adsorption at the interstitials between l-cysteine functional groups, combined with pH-controlled charge
transfer that removes electronic gap states from MoS2.
MoS2–Cys-based chemiresistors can be deployed in-line
to detect metal ions without any need for additional offline measurements.

Introduction
Contamination of global water resources
has increased substantially in recent years due to increasing human
activity and population. To meet the drinking water requirements of
today’s world, sophisticated diagnostics of clean water and
wastewater streams is vital, especially for concerns of metal-ion
contamination.1 Contaminants commonly found
in drinking water include transition metals such as Mn, Fe, Co, Cu,
Mo, Zn, Cu, Cd, and Hg, as well as post-transition metals such as
Pb, As, and B. All of these contaminants, and others, are globally
regulated to levels in the ppb or sub-ppb range.1 In many cases, metal ions can cause harmful health effects
if consumed by humans or animals, which can have acute or chronic
consequences due to bioaccumulation. Specifically, the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) mandated that the limit of Cd in drinking
water should be as low as 5 ppb concentration. Comparison of this
limit with the significantly higher (50 ppb) EPA limit for manganese,
not considered to be damaging to health, is indicative of the importance
of high-sensitivity detection of cadmium in water, where it normally
restructures as Cd2+ ions.

State-of-the-art detection
methods for metal ions in water include (i) electrochemical techniques
such as anodic stripping voltammetry, which can access the ppb and
sub-ppb concentration ranges;2−9 (ii) optical detection techniques (including fluorescence, luminescence,
or colorimetric detection10−16) and (iii) electrical transduction sensing via chemiresistor or
field-effect transistor architectures.17−25 Of these detection categories, electrical transduction devices are
preferred due to reduced complexity, as they do not require additional
offline measurements (such as with optical methods) and are not complicated
by the need for high-maintenance cost reference electrodes (as in
the case of electrochemical methods).1 Three-terminal
field-effect transistors based on molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and diselenide (MoSe2) are known to exhibit high-accuracy
and low-detection threshold for gas sensing,20−27 but equivalent sensors for detection of metal ions in water have
not yet been demonstrated. Furthermore, a two-terminal chemiresistor
is highly desirable over transistor (triode) architectures in terms
of reduced device complexity.

A chemiresistor detects contaminants
as they act as dopants or impurities that induce changes in the device’s
electrical conductivity, even when they are present only at the ppb
level.17−25 This is different from electrochemical sensors in which redox processes
must occur at the electrode surface. In chemiresistors, thickness
and surface area of the active layer are directly related to the sensor
response time and sensitivity, with thinner films and higher surface
areas leading to better performance. Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is an excellent candidate material for chemiresistor sensing
as well as other environmental applications.28,29 Two-dimensional (2D) MoS2 nanosheets exhibit p-type semiconducting
properties with electrical transport sensitive to doping by charge
transfer.29 Few-layer 2D MoS2 can be readily exfoliated by solution-processing techniques28,30 and restacked into thin films by common thin-film fabrication methods,
including drop casting, spin coating, and vacuum filtration. Solution-processed
MoS2 nanosheets are uniquely positioned as robust sensing
platforms for metal detection because they can be easily decorated
with carboxylated groups28 in a one-pot
methodology that favorably compares, in terms of cost competitiveness
and low complexity, to the preparation of reduced graphene oxide and
epitaxial growth of 2D MoS2 on graphene or SiC.18,29 Functionalization of carboxylated MoS2 (MoS2–COOH) with amino acids may add receptors that are sensitive
to specific metal ions. l-Cysteine and small molecules such
as glutathione are known to have a high affinity for divalent metal
ions such as Cd and Hg, respectively,28,31−33 and can be similarly used to sensitize MoS2 toward these
elements.

Here, MoS2 nanosheets functionalized with l-cysteine (MoS2–Cys) will be examined as
candidate materials for chemiresistors showing high selectivity and
preferential sensitivity for Cd2+ ions in water at neutral
pH in the 1–500 ppb range. These sensors will be prepared from
MoS2–COOH by a simple, low-cost method to display
a low detection limit for Cd2+. Chemiresistors based on
our technology have been demonstrated to operate irrespective of the
presence of counterions or other metal ions in water. Compared to
similar devices comprising an active layer of epitaxially grown SiC,18 MoS2–Cys will have lower fabrication
costs, and will be shown to have a lower detection limit for Cd2+. MoS2–Cys is anticipated to display selective
and tunable sensitivity to different metal ions depending on the pH
of the metal ion solution used, where a sensitivity enhancement of
1–2 orders of magnitude can be achieved for Cd2+ sensing.

Results and Discussion
Preparation of our in-line chemiresistor
devices utilizes thin films of material deposited on a poly(ether)sulfone
(PES) porous support backing to form a high-surface area sensor. The
fabrication protocol is summarized in Figure 1a, where the active sensing layer is comprised
of MoS2–Cys. The chemiresistor sensitivity is controlled
by defining a sensing area between two metal electrodes, Al in this
case, deposited prior to the vacuum filtration of MoS2 solution. Pores
in the PES are preserved when the Al thickness is on the order of
100 nm. In this way, both MoS2–Cys films and Al
electrodes are porous and do not disturb the water flow through the
device during the sensing process.

Figure 1 (a) MoS2–Cys preparation

cross-linking for Cys functionalization and fabrication of two-terminal
chemiresistors. MoS2–Cys thin films can be prepared
by vacuum filtration and incorporated in these devices. 2-keV scanning

and (c) MoS2–Cys (1:20 MoS2/Cys mass
ratio), showing Cys functionalization as a network of filaments on
the surface of MoS2 aggregates. Photographs are the authors’
own work.

Figure 1b,c shows the SEM images of MoS2-COOH and MoS2–Cys thin films, respectively. In both panels (b) and
(c), it is evident that 2D MoS2 nanosheets tend to stack
in aggregates from 100 nm to 2 μm thickness. Although individual
nanoscale platelets are not readily visible by SEM, numerous nanoscale
platelets mixed with micron-size pieces have been detected and investigated
via atomic force microscopy. The number of layers present in the flakes
ranges from 5 to 10 layers for nanoscale platelets to hundreds of
layers for micron-size platelets.28

Comparison of the two panels demonstrates the effects of cysteine
on the thin-film morphology as a cross-linker between MoS2 platelets. MoS2–COOH prepared by the same method
used here has been previously shown to be mainly arranged in few-layer
nanosheets.28 On the contrary, thicker
aggregates are visible in Figure 1b from thin films obtained by vacuum filtration, and
a more continuous film is noticeable in panel (c) due to Cys-induced
cross-linking. We thus infer that functionalization converts MoS2–COOH films made of disconnected platelets into cross-linked
networks of MoS2 flakes interconnected by Cys filaments,
with the ability to preferentially retain ions with which they exhibit
affinity.

Figure 2a presents the SEM micrograph of a MoS2–Cys chemiresistor
channel, along with elemental maps obtained by energy-dispersive X-ray
(EDX). Magnification of the SEM image is lower than previously reported
in Figure 1b,c. EDX
maps show the distribution of N, Mo, and S, as well as Al from the
gap-cell contacts. Nitrogen is uniformly distributed, also indicating
a uniform presence of Cys filaments, as the only nitrogen source in
this system is the amine from these functionals. Mo and S are distributed
throughout as expected, with some large particles of MoS2 visible on the surface. Examination of sulfur atomic percentages
determined from EDX show larger amounts of S than expected for stoichiometric
MoS2 alone, confirming that Cys functionals (also containing
S) are present.

Figure 2 (a) Ten kiloelectron Volts SEM/EDX images of 1:10 mass
ratio MoS2:Cys chemiresistor channel. MoS2 flakes
are visible in the device channel between red dotted lines. Region
outside the channel is occupied by Al contacts. The porous nature
of the chemiresistor is evidenced by minimally covered 0.8 μm
pores (black dots) from the underlying PES membrane. EDX S, Mo, N,
and Al maps are also reported. (b) Raman spectra of MoS2–COOH (blue) and MoS2–Cys (red) casted on
Si wafers. Before Cys functionalization, Raman S–S and SH stretching
bands representing residual TGA are clearly visible. After functionalization,
a new feature (*) is the fingerprint of Cys attachment to MoS2.

Figure 2b compares the Raman spectra of MoS2–COOH
and MoS2–Cys. MoS2–COOH was measured
before being washed to remove unreacted TGA that has not combined
with MoS2. Raman-active S–S bending, S–H
stretching, and hydrocarbon stretching modes from TGA are clearly
visible, along with the stretching modes characteristic of MoS2, at 409 and 385 cm–1.28 After functionalization, the sharp S–H stretching
peak of TGA is replaced by a significantly broader counterpart from
cysteine, which is centered at ∼2650 cm–1. Hydrocarbon modes are also significantly broadened because of the
structural disorder introduced by the solid-state nature of these
peaks, as opposed to their molecular counterparts in TGA.28 The most important Raman feature for our work,
marked with (*) in Figure 2b, is distinctive of cysteine bonding with the chalcogenide
backbone. Assignment of this peak to Cys-bonded MoS2 has
been widely corroborated in ref (28) with additional characterization, which shows
a clear upshift of the 409 cm–1 Raman peak of MoS2 in the presence of stable and irreversible l-cysteine
functionalization.

We anticipate that stable Cys bonding to MoS2 is critical toward
MoS2–Cys sensing performance. Figure 3a shows the response of a MoS2–Cys chemiresistor upon injection with a deionized (DI) water
stream contaminated with increasing concentrations of Cd2+ ions, from 1 to 500 ppb. The chemiresistors operate by measuring
the relative resistivity changes (δρ/ρ) over time
when impurities are added to water flowing in-line through two-terminal
porous MoS2–Cys gap cells. We anticipate that δρ
is normally positive (i.e., MoS2 resistivity increases with increasing metal-ion concentrations in the filtrated water
stream). Thus, our sensing process is different from the decrease
in water ionic resistance due to impurities.

Figure 3 (a) Time domain sensing
performance of MoS2–Cys chemiresistor (MoS2/Cys = 1:1) for as-prepared CdCl2 and MnCl2 water-containing solutions at 1–500 ppb concentrations. Metal
ions are detected by the resulting increase in the resistance (δρ/ρ)
(b) δρ/ρ of chemiresistors at different MoS2/Cys mass ratios at different Cd2+ concentrations
in the presence of Cl– counterions. (c) δρ/ρ
of 1:20 MoS2/Cys chemiresistor challenged with permeation from dilute
CdCl2, Cd(NO3)2, and MnCl2, solutions,
as well as a 1:1 mixture of CdCl2 and MnCl2.
At a very low concentration range, the sensor is selective for Cd2+ independent of the counterion present, with the highest
sensitivity and lowest interference at 10 ppb.

The response in terms of resistivity increase is
nearly immediate (<1 s). However, at MoS2/Cys = 1:1
mass ratio, differentiation between Mn2+ and Cd2+ ions is minimal, with both ions appearing to increase the sensor
resistance due to charge transfer between MoS2–Cys
and the coordinating metal ions, which remove electronic states (acting
as electron donors) from the band gap of MoS2.28 Furthermore, the sensitivity of 1:1 mass ratio
MoS2/Cys sensors is below the EPA-mandated level1 of 5 ppb for Cd in drinking water. Chemiresistor
performance reported in Figure 3a needed to be improved both in terms of sensitivity and selectivity,
which required to adjust the MoS2/Cys ratio in the active
layer and the pH of the water stream, respectively.

To increase
the sensitivity of MoS2–Cys chemiresistors to lower
concentrations of Cd2+ ions, larger amounts of l-cysteine were used in the thin-film fabrication process. Figure 3b reports δρ/ρ
from chemiresistors prepared from MoS2–Cys thin
films at 1:1, 1:10, and 1:20 MoS2/Cys mass ratios and their
comparison with analytical standards of water at varying concentrations
of Cd2+ ions. Differently from the 1:1 MoS2/Cys
device, both 1:10 and 1:20 active layers show improved sensitivity
to Cd2+ due to significantly smaller error bars, which
enable a linear response in the 0.1–10 ppb range. However,
the price of higher sensitivity to lower concentrations is paid in
terms of lower overall magnitude of δρ/ρ, as displayed
by sensors with a lower MoS2/Cys ratio. This happens because
ρ, the dry base resistance, significantly increases from 140
± 10 kΩ at 1:1 mass ratio to 250 ± 10 kΩ at
1:20 (see Supporting Information Figure S1). This demonstrates that Cys bonding is a necessary ingredient to
improve the electrical conductivity of MoS2 thin films.
As l-cysteine is an electrical insulator, increase in electrical
conductivity at higher Cys contents could be assigned to the addition
of states in the band gap of MoS2 via electronic charge
transfer.27

Consistency of Cd2+ sensing performance in the presence of different counterions
was also examined. Figure 3c shows the values of δρ/ρ of a 1:20 MoS2/Cys chemiresistor challenged with (i) Cd2+ from
CdCl2 and Cd(NO3)2 (pH = 5.0), (ii)
Mn2+ (pH = 6.0) from MnCl2 and (iii) a mixture
of CdCl2 and MnCl2 (pH = 5.6) leading to interference
of Mn2+ and Cd2+ ions. At the lowest concentrations,
this chemiresistor is preferentially selective to Cd2+,
with the highest sensitivity and lowest interference observed at 10
ppb. For a single ion–counterion pair, the sensors shown here
are capable of quantitatively indicating the concentration in the
1–100 ppb range. When a mixture with different counterions
is used, the sensors continue to function qualitatively to determine
if Cd is present at very low concentrations, but the observed difference
between Cd concentration values decreases, making the concentration
more difficult to determine. This effect results from the sensitivity
to different ions at different concentrations depending on the MoS2/Cys ratio used in the fabrication process. However, because
of the strong difference in the acidity of the water streams used
in Figure 3c, detailed
understanding of the optimal performance in terms of pH is required.

To examine the effect of pH on the chemiresistor performance, 10
ppb solutions of Cd2+ and Mn2+ ions were tested
at buffered pH from 3 to 10. Figure 4a shows δρ/ρ for 1:20 MoS2/Cys sensors at varying pH. At the lowest (pH < 5) and highest
(pH > 9) values, little selectivity can be noticed between metal
ions at similar hydrodynamic radii, such as Cd2+ and Mn2+. Chemiresistors are “shorted” by the high
ionic conductivity of water, with low resistances in the 10–1000
Ω range (Figure 2S, Supporting Information).
This limits the useful sensing window to pH = 5–9, which is
well within the range for drinking water. Selectivity to different
ions still varies dramatically in this range. However, at a neutral
pH of 6–7 (i.e., the values expected for drinking water), Figure 4a also shows that
the sensor is highly sensitive to Cd2+ regardless of the
presence of chloride or nitrate counterions. Interference from Mn2+ ions is also negligible in this range by comparison. This
indicates that optimized MoS2–Cys chemiresistors
fabricated at 1:20 constituent ratios satisfy the detection requirements
for Cd2+ ions, both in terms of sensitivity and selectivity
from metal ions of comparable radii. Of course, additional selectivity
from metal ions at different hydrodynamic radii can always be obtained
by preliminary filtration of the water stream.

the sensitivity of (a) MoS2–Cys sensors to different
metal ions depending on the pH and metal ion used and (b) MoS2–COOH compared to MoS2–Cys using
a 10 ppb solution at varying pH. (c) Charge transfer at the nanostructured
surface of MoS2–Cys films. The high surface area
facilitates charge transfer between dilute metal ions and the thiol
and disulfide groups that modulate the conductivity across the MoS2 backbone of the chemiresistor.

From a fundamental standpoint, it is worth noting
that sensing of Cd2+ is also enhanced at pH = 9.0 due to
the formation of Cd(OH)2 groups that may form in basic
environments. The formation of these groups is independent of the
counterions present, and our results indicate that MoS2–Cys chemiresistors are strongly sensitive to them. Although
Cd2+ sensing is dramatically enhanced at pH = 9, this effect
is completely overshadowed by the tremendous sensitivity increase
(∼20) at neutral pH. At this pH level, CdCl+ complexes
are present, as Cd is not completely dissociated from Cl ions. MoS2–Cys is found to be uniquely sensitive to this compound,
perhaps due strong interaction with S–H and S–S ligands
present on cysteine and cystine in the MoS2–Cys
layer. Additionally, at this pH level, the sensor shows a very strong
but negative (i.e., δρ < 0) sensitivity for Cd(NO3)2, allowing for not only selectivity for Cd2+ at the appropriate pH but also for the type of counterion
present in this specific case. While MoS2–Cys provides
minimal sensitivity to Mn at neutral pH, Figure 2a shows that sensitivity to Mn2+ can be obtained at different pH windows, and specifically at pH
= 5 and 8 when MnCl2 and MnOH+ complexes are
present, respectively. These results indicate that MoS2–Cys chemiresistors can be modified to detect different metal
ions by modifying the pH of the water stream.

To investigate
the role of cysteine in the sensing mechanism, chemiresistors from
MoS2–COOH were also constructed, and their performance
is shown in Figure 2b under the same testing conditions as that of the MoS2–Cys device in panel (a). It can be readily observed that,
at pH = 6−7, δρ/ρ ≈ 0.3 for the MoS2–COOH device, to be compared with δρ/ρ
≈ 20 for MoS2–Cys. We thus infer that sensitivity
to Cd2+ ions is clearly due to cysteine and is not a native
property of MoS2. Furthermore, although MoS2–COOH appears to be sensitive to Cd2+, δρ/ρ
has been found to be independent of the specific metal ion in such
chemiresistors and is a sole consequence of changes in pH. This can
also be inferred from the approximately linear increase in δρ/ρ
from pH = 5 to 10. Along with the morphology noticeable from Figure 2b,c, this result
strongly suggests that preferential sensitivity of MoS2–Cys to Cd2+ is not the result of metal-ion intercalation
between MoS2 layers but due to Cd2+ adsorption
at cysteine functionals, which modifies the charge transfer processes
between cysteine-based functional groups and the MoS2 backbone.
As shown in Figure 4c, the high surface area and thinness of the MoS2–Cys
film facilitates charge transfer between the metal ions and solution
over a large area, which is sufficient to affect the conductivity
of the film backbone, even at very dilute ion concentrations in water.
Electrical transport in solids is extremely sensitive to the presence
of gap states. We thus suspect that Cd2+ is selectively
detected because of its size-driven affinity to l-cysteine,
combined with charge transfer that removes electronic states from
the electronic band gap of MoS2. The degree of charge transfer
depends on the number and type of ions present in the solution and
can be increased or decreased by tuning the pH of the incoming solution.

Conclusions
MoS2–Cys thin films have
been shown to sense dilute Cd2+ ions in water at neutral
pH and in the 1–10 ppb range, with high selectivity and low
interference from other metal ions. MoS2–Cys porous
chemiresistors are shown to have tunable sensitivity to different
metal ions depending on the pH of filtrated water. Cd2+ is preferentially adsorbed by the Cys groups (consistently with
significantly lower effects in MoS2–COOH), and ions
are sensed through charge transfer at the surface of MoS2–Cys films with a high density of thiol and disulfide groups
that modulate their conductivity. MoS2–Cys is a
chemiresistor that can be easily produced in large quantities using
readily available raw materials and low-complexity fabrication methods.
The chemiresistive devices described in this paper are naturally porous
and permeated by water, so they can be used to provide in-line and
real-time sensing information about metal-ion concentration, with
high reusability. Their response time is ∼1 s, or less. The
lower detection limit is in the sub-ppb range, and sensing can be
accomplished without any need for offline measurements or additional
equipment, as in the case of electrochemical or optical detection
methods. Our work provides a benchmark for chemiresistor design using
functionalized MoS2 to sense metal ions in water.

Materials and Methods
Preparation of MoS2–Cys Suspensions
A detailed description of the methodology used for the preparation
of MoS2–Cys is reported by Bazylewski et al.28,31 Briefly, 7.6 g of microcrystalline MoS2 powder (Sigma
Aldrich, CAS 1317-33-5; 6 μm average grain size, 40 μm
grain size max) was mixed with 38 mL of thioglycolic acid (TGA, Sigma
Aldrich, CAS 68-11-1) and stirred for 24 h at room temperature. Four
hundred milliliters of distilled water was added to the mixture that
was ultrasonicated for 2 h to produce a stable suspension of carboxylated
MoS2 (MoS2–COOH) nanosheets at 1.5 g/L
concentration. Functionalization with l-cysteine (Sigma Aldrich,
CAS 59-90-4) was performed by amide cross-linking. To this end, N-(3-dimethyl-aminopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide
hydrochloride (EDC, Sigma Aldrich, CAS 25952-53-8) and N-hydroxy-succinimide (NHS, Sigma Aldrich, CAS 6066-82-6) were added
to the suspension at 1:1 and 1:1.5 (respectively) mass ratios over
MoS2 and stirred for 15 min. Afterward, MoS2/Cys is obtained by mixing an l-cysteine solution in distilled
water to these suspensions.28,31l-Cysteine
solutions can be prepared at varying Cys concentrations to adjust
the MoS2/Cys mass ratio at the desired level, where MoS2/Cys mass ratios of 1:20 or less have been found to remain
stable in water over periods longer than one month. Specific characterization
protocols are used to determine the cysteine bonding regime in MoS2–Cys.28

Chemiresistor Fabrication and Measurement
Thin films
of MoS2–Cys were prepared from 50 mL of solution deposited
on poly(ether)sulfone (PES, 3M Co.) membranes with 0.8 μm pore
size accordingly to the vacuum filtration method originally developed
by Eda et al.34 for graphene oxide thin
films. These films are subsequently dried in air for 4 h at room temperature
prior to further processing. A gap cell consisting of two aluminum
electrodes (1 mm width, 100 nm thickness, 25 μm gap between)
was evaporated on these films at base pressures better than 10−6 mTorr in a Kurt–Lesker thermal evaporator
setup, with the Al thickness measured in situ by a Sycom STM-2 quartz
crystal monitor. Electrodes are defined using a shadow mask.

Chemiresistor fabrication was completed by integrating the two-terminal
gap cell described above into a custom-built transducing apparatus
reported in detail by Van Middelkoop et al.35 In this setup, Al electrodes are contacted with a bridge circuit
interfaced with a digital–analog converter (Emant 300) that
is computer-controlled by a Matlab routine for continuous monitoring
of the device resistivity over time. This apparatus includes a 100
mL capacity funnel on top of the Al/MoS2–Cys/PES
gap cell membrane and a fritted glass support connected to a pump
underneath. Initially, the device resistivity is primed by filtrating
100 mL of high-resistivity (18 MΩ cm) deionized (DI) water through
the porous chemiresistor, during which baseline resistivity (ρ)
is measured by applying, at each time interval, an array of currents
in the 0–600 μA range at a 40 μA step. Resulting
voltages are measured, and ρ is determined through the slope
of the I–V curves. As this
is significantly lower than water resistivity, ρ is proportional
the resistance of the MoS2–Cys gap cell.

Tests
were performed by adding to 5–8 mL of water with dissolved
metal ions into the 100 mL DI water funnel, while δρ is
continuously monitored by the transducing circuit of the chemiresistor.
In a variety of tests, calibrated water solutions at metal ion concentrations
from 0.1 to 500 ppb were poured through the apparatus. Addition of
ion-containing water to the filtration stream is repeated with high
reproducibility and low δρ/ρ drift over time. Metal-containing
solutions were prepared using CdCl2 (Sigma Aldrich, CAS
10108-64-2) and Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (CAS 10022-68-1) measured by a high-accuracy Denver PI314 scale
and dissolved in deionized water by considering the concentration
of metal ions (either Mn2+ or Cd2+) in the range
of 0.1–500 ppb. Preferential sensitivity to Cd2+ is verified in the presence of different counterions (i.e., Cl– and NO3–, from CdCl2 and Cd(NO3)2·4H2O,
respectively) and with metal ions (e.g., Mn2–) at
similar hydrodynamic radius as that of Cd2+. Control experiments
with MoS2–COOH active layers in lieu of MoS2–Cys have also been performed. Throughout the course
of standard testing, each sensor (of 0.0252 mm size over
a 25 mm2 filtration disk) is primed with a minimum of 10
L of water passed through it before metal contaminants are tested.

Thin Film Microscopic Characterization
A Zeiss scanning
electron microscope (LEO 1540XB) equipped with an energy-dispersive
X-ray (EDX) spectrometer with imaging capabilities was used to characterize
MoS2–COOH and MoS2–Cys thin films
and map the distribution of Mo and S (from MoS2) and N (from Cys). SEM samples were prepared by vacuum filtration
onto polycarbonate membranes (pore size 0.5 μm). Samples were
coated with 1 nm layer of osmium prior to measurement to increase
the surface conductivity using an Os plasma coater (Flogen, OPC80T).
Samples of sensor devices for EDX analysis were measured as prepared,
on PES membranes. Extensive additional structural and spectroscopic
characterization is reported elsewhere.28,31

Raman Characterization
Unpolarized Raman spectra were
recorded on a Renishaw InVia microspectrometer in a backscattering
arrangement. A 633 nm helium–neon laser with a maximum output
power of 17 mW was used as the excitation source. The power at the
sample surface was 0.02 mW/μm2 across an 8 μm2 area. Special attention was paid to avoid damage of the sample
by heating by shuttering the laser when not actively measuring. Raman
measurements were performed on MoS2–COOH and MoS2–Cys samples cast from solution onto (110) silicon
wafers. Samples were dried at 50 °C in air, then washed with
distilled water, and dried again at 50 °C for 30 min.
