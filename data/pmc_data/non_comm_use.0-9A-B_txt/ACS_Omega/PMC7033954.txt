There is an error in Figure 6, wherein the control image is duplicated
in the place of
SAM-treated RAW cells. The corrected image is given below.

Figure 6 High content
screening of the RAW 264.7 cell lines under different
conditions. (Control = control group; LPS-induced = LPS-induced group;
N-GQDs + control = control along with N-GQDs; N-GQDs + induced = LPS-induced
treated with N-GQDs; N-GQDs + SAM = LPS=induced treated with SAM +
N-GQDs and SAM = LPS-induced treated with SAM alone).
