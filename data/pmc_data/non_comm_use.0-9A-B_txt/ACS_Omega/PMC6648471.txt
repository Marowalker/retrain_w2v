Intermolecular
interactions impact self-assembly phenomena having
a variety of bio/chemical, physical, and mechanical consequences.
Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms leading to a controlled stereo-
and chemo-specific aggregation at the molecular level often remain
elusive because of the intrinsically dynamic nature of these processes.
Herein, we describe two 3-styryl coumarin molecular rotors capable
of probing subtle intermolecular interactions controlling the self-assembly
of a small-molecule organogelator. Complementing the characterization
of the gel via circular dichroism and atomic force microscopy, thorough
spectroscopic investigations on these sensors were carried out to
prove their high chemical and spatial affinity toward the 3D supramolecular
network. The results were further supported by molecular dynamics
simulations to reveal further critical insights into the gelator’s
dynamic self-assembly mechanism. These sensors could potentially serve
as templates to study a variety of soft-supramolecular architectures
and the ways in which they assemble.

Introduction
Proposing an innovative
design paradigm for smart functional materials
in the field of soft matter requires fundamental understanding of
both material and functional properties. A class of fluorescent probes
known as molecular rotors exhibit predictable variations in their
spectral properties in response to changes in their local environment.1−3 Such probes can sense and photophysically respond to the friction
generated by intermolecular forces, thereby acting as tools to measure
viscosity (η) at the nanoscale.2,4−6 As molecules self-assemble in solution, there are a myriad of factors
which can control fibril and fiber growth, their directional and hierarchical
architectures, and the resultant dynamic properties of these structures.7,8 To better understand both the static nature of the structuring gellant
and dynamic nature of a gel’s bulk liquid, several different
techniques have been developed to study both viscosity and flow.9,10 Leveraging the photophysical properties of small molecules, which
can be demonstrated not to interfere in the dynamical processes allows
researchers to study the gellant’s structure and gel’s
potential functions.11,12 These techniques are of great
interest to study biological systems in situ as the complex environments
of both cytoplasm and thickened extracellular fluids can govern the
reactivity and biochemistry of natural processes.9,13 Beyond
this, understanding and learning to control the phase transitions
and rheology of oil and gas mixtures and consumer products can help
serve to impact the efficiency and economics of transferring and storing
liquid, solid, and hybrid-phase solutions.14,15

Molecular organogels are soft viscoelastic solids comprised
of
self-organized unit structures, which can form fibers and trap solvent
molecules within their assemblies.16,17 In particular,
a clear description of the nature of molecular assembly and nanoscale
morphology requires fundamental understanding of the molecular interactions
leading to gelation.18 Although these organogel
systems display an infinite bulk viscosity, most demonstrate liquid-like
properties, being primarily composed of solvents.19,20 Nevertheless, various efforts have been made to understand their
assembly process,21,22 the real-time probing of the
self-assembly process through change in intermolecular interactions
within the 3D network is rarely explored. In this context, fluorescent
molecular rotors could potentially serve as an experimental platform
to investigate the role of changing intermolecular forces in the 3D-network
formation throughout gelation. Inspired by some of the previous reports
on the use of stimuli-responsive systems toward probing the interactions
in soft supramolecular assemblies,23−29 we scrutinized the dynamic and complex process underlying the gel
formation of a low-molecular-weight gelator by leveraging the dependence
of these fluorescent probes upon molecular motion restriction. By
synthesizing glucose and acid group-containing derivatives tailored
to distinctively complement an amphiphilic small-molecule glucoside
ester gelator, we may be able to study fibril formation and gel setting
thus leveraging complementary and programmed noncovalent interactions.
Herein, we describe the experimental investigation of molecular self-assembly
supported substantially through computational studies to explore the
potential of these as-prepared functional smart materials as tools
for characterizing soft-supramolecular assemblies. To better understand
their structure-property relationship, we present here a combined
aspect of spectroscopy and microscopy, correlated with computational
evidence.

Results
The viscosity-dependence of the novel coumarin-based
molecular
rotor C1 was assessed in toluene–Polyethylene
glycol (PEG) methyl ether methacrylate mixtures (Figure 1, Supporting Information Figure S7). C1’s fluorescence
intensity displays a linear double-logarithmic dependence on bulk
viscosity with a slope of 0.2 (Supporting Information Figure S8). This supports the rotor-like photophysical behavior
of C1, even though a traditional molecular rotor strictly
follows Forster–Hoffman behavior,28 that is, displaying a slope of around 0.5. This seems to suggest
that C1 possesses a more complex photophysical mechanism
than traditional rotors, which will be the object of the future study.
The restriction of intramolecular motion in increasingly viscous media
helps C1 to exhibit emission from the local excited state
and modulation of the overall quantum yield via twisted intramolecular
charge-transfer transition state, similar to other stilbene-based
rotors.1,30,31

molecular rotor C1 (b) and fluorescence spectra at increasing
viscosity (viscosity values in cSt: 0.7, 53, 100, 280, and 440).

C1 was tested in
low concentrations in toluene gelled
with the raspberry ketone glucoside caprylate gelator (R8, Figure 2).19 This compound exemplifies a vast family of amphiphilic
organogelators bearing a highly polar sugar core and at least one
long partially hydrophobic alkyl chain.32,33R8 possesses a minimum gelation concentration of 0.46 wt % in toluene,
and a temperature of gelation at 1.0 wt % (w/v) of 45–47 °C.
Optically clear gels can be formed through thermoreversible gelation
(Figure 2b).19,34 Oscillatory dynamic rheology demonstrates the thixotropic (mechano-reversible)
behavior of the toluene gels (Supporting Information Figure S9) common to a variety of polymeric and molecular gels.35,36 In nonpolar solvents, X-ray diffraction highlights the β′
conformation of the fatty acid tails on the exterior of the 3D-network
indicating that the gelator packs in a fashion similar to natural
triglycerides in a 3D-epitaxial arrangement.19 UV–vis circular dichroism (CD) of the unassembled gelator
in ethanol and the 1.0 wt % (w/v) toluene sol above the temperature
of gelation (45–47 °C) (Figure 2c, red and green line, respectively) demonstrated
primarily a small positive band corresponding to the ketone absorption
at 270 nm. Around 4 min into gelation, the system exhibited a substantial
negative excitonic CD signal arising from the alkyl phenol moiety
at 290 nm (blue line, Figure 2c).37

system: chemical structure of the gelator R8 and (b)

(left vial) and after (right vial). (c) CD spectra of R8 toluene solutions in different conditions: R8 sol in
ethanol at RT (red line), 1% R8 sol in toluene (green
line) and 1% R8 gel in toluene (blue line).

These results suggest that the supramolecular gelator
architecture
is itself chiral in nature. This observation matches well with atomic
force microscopy (AFM) images of a drop-cast 1.0 wt % (w/v) toluene
gel, clearly showing right-handed nanoscopic helices about 6 nm thick
and more than 200 nm-long (Figure 3a,b). Molecular and structural investigation of the
fibrils via coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations suggests
that the nonpolar alkyl tail and phenolic head reside on the outside
of the fibril, whereas the hydrophilic glucose moiety faces inwards,
as expected in toluene (Figure 3c–e, and Supporting Information Figure S11). Large-scale MD simulations suggested that the helical
architecture results from the intertwining of two tubular structures
each of which consists of four-molecule discs stacked longitudinally
(Figure 3c–e).
Here, we propose that the gelator’s extended hydrophobic tails
serve to reduce the surface tension in the solvent, thereby allowing
the shielded glucose moieties to assemble and drive the sol–gel
transition. A computational model obtained by fixing the diameter
at the one observed in the AFM images (∼6 nm) shows the same
pitch as in the gelator fibrils (∼3.5 nm) (Figure 3b).

In monitoring the fluorescence
of R8 toluene gels
doped with the C1 probe, they exhibited a minor increase
in fluorescence upon gelation (Supporting Information Figure S12). A similar response was observed by Geiger et al. with
merocyanine-based dyes,20 while Raeburn
et al. reported on the general and hardly rationalizable spectroscopic
behavior of common fluorophores (ThT, DCVJ, and so forth.) to changes
in viscosity.38 We can infer that C1 does not effectively intercalate within the gelator fibrils
and remains mostly in highly fluid regions of the gel network. To
dynamically probe the gelator architecture, tailored C1 analogues were designed to have a specific affinity to portions
of the gelator assemblies (Figure 4a,b). Glucose and octanoic acid moieties, both of which
comprise components of the gelator structure, were introduced into C1 via azide–alkyne Huisgen cycloaddition to give rise
to Glu-C1 and Oct-C1 (Supporting Information 3 and Supporting Information Figure
S7), following the idea that these moieties may interact preferentially
with either the hydrophilic head and hydrophobic tails of R8 fibers, respectively. Glu-C1 and Oct-C1 both displayed a fluorescence behavior quite similar to the precursor C1 (Figure 4a,b and Supporting Information Figure
S8), which suggests that the original photophysical properties remain
unaffected with functionalization. Coarse grain and all-atom MD simulations
supported this molecular design. Indeed, they confirmed that such
chemical modifications cause the coumarin portions to reside in two
spatially distinct regions of the gelator fibril: either exposed in
the solvent (Glu-C1) or within the assembly (Oct-C1) (Figure 5a,b and Supporting Information Figure S15). Figure 5b shows that the
coumarin portion of Oct-C1 resides among the sugar core
causing a partial perturbation of the H-bond network that stabilizes
successive sugar layers (Supporting Information Figure S16). At the same time, the probe forms H-bonds with adjacent
hydroxyl groups through its lactone carbonyl and cyano group (Figure 5b, black dotted lines).

emission spectra of Oct-C1 acquired throughout the gelation
process of 1% R8 in toluene (curve 1: 0 min; curve 2:

Solutions of R8 in toluene (1.0 wt % w/v) were
gelled
with either Glu-C1 or Oct-C1 (200 nM). Confocal
fluorescence microscopy performed on doped gels shows the uptake of
the fluorescent probes into grown microscopic fibers (Supporting Information Figure S14). Fluorescence
spectra were monitored over the course of gelation starting from the
hot sol at 100 °C to the gel at 25 °C. Figure 5c,d shows the marked difference
between the fluorescence emission spectra of Glu-C1 and Oct-C1, respectively. The emission spectra of Glu-C1 highlight a monotonic increase in intensity, which is readily attributed
to a progressive rigidification of the nearby environment of the rotor.10 Conversely, Oct-C1 shows an increase
in fluorescence intensity, accompanied with a red-shift, subsequently
followed by a diminution of the luminescence that is blue-shifted;
this pattern suggests a multistep stiffening process.

According
to the computational model in Figure 5a and Supporting Information Figure S11, the interaction of the glucose ring in Glu-C1 with the gelator’s sugar moieties causes its coumarin portion
to project from the fibrils, and be exposed to the toluene phase.
Such a peculiar spatial arrangement along the R8 fibrils
allows Glu-C1 to respond to the change in molecular fluidity
occurring at the hydrophobic interface of the fibrils. Figure 6a–f shows time-transient
AFM images of drop-cast 1.0 wt % R8 gels obtained over
the course of gelation (0–6 min). Starting from an apparently
unassembled system (Figure 6a), protofibrils begin to grow in tight contact with each
other forming oriented chiral bundles (Figure 6b–e). The attractive longitudinal
association among fibrils captured by Glu-C1 and their
epitaxial growth take place simultaneously, instead of constituting
two distinct steps in the gelation process. After about 4 min, the
increase in fluorescence emission plateaus, suggesting little response
of the probe toward the helix formation observed after that time (Figure 6e,f). All normalized
fluorescence intensities are greater than the limit of the calibration
(Supporting Information Figure S8), indicating
that the calculated local viscosity at the fibril–fibril interface
reaches very high values; this effect arguably owes to the high level
of interdigitation of R8 hydrophobic portions.

atropoisomeric stabilization. (a–f) The epitaxial growth of
the gelator fibers over gelation (6 min). Tubular structures visible
after 30 s (scale bar: 25 nm) (b). between 4 and 6 min (e and f, respectively),
the elongated fibers exhibits a torsion around their longitudinal
axis that results in the formation of right-handed double helices
(f).

The multiphase fluorescence readout
of Oct-C1 is able
to capture the actual liquid-to-gel transition occurring between 4
and 6 min (Figure 5d and Figure 6e,f).
At time zero, when the system merely consists of nascent protofibrils
(Figure 6a), Oct-C1 displays a broad band seemingly resulting from two
overlapping bands. Between 0.5 and 3 min (Figure 5d, curve 1–2), the red-shifted band
becomes more and more intense at the expense of the blue-shifted.
The extrapolated values of local viscosity at time 0 and 3 min (Figure 5d, curve 1 and 2)
suggest a liquid-like nature of the system (2.3 cSt and 4.1 cSt, respectively),
in spite of the extremely high rigidity and stability of the sugar
core acting as the protofibril’s central pillar (Supporting Information Figure S13): this observation
matches well with computation, whereby Oct-C1’s
environmental interactions are less effective from a photophysical
standpoint owing to both a partial alteration of the fibril’s
hydrophilic core upon intercalation and the labile H-bonds established
with the surroundings (Figure 5b and Supporting Information Figure
S13).

After minute 3 (Figure 5d, curve 2–3), the red-shifted band (556 nm)
gradually
decreases in intensity along with the blue-shifted band peaking at
528 nm that instead becomes preponderant. We attributed this phenomenon
to two co-existing conformers of Oct-C1 by recording
fluorescence emission spectra at different temperatures in pure toluene
in the absence of the R8 gelator. Supporting Information Figure S17 shows that at RT, the red-shifted
band is the main one. However, at higher temperature, the blue-shifted
band surpasses the red-shifted one in intensity, clearly suggesting
that there exists an energy barrier between the two putative species
that can be overcome thermally. Interestingly, this conversion is
completely reversible upon cooling.

On the basis of these observations,
we hypothesized that Oct-C1 consists of two rotamers
(i.e., rotational isomers)
arising from the partially restricted rotation around the coumarin–stilbene
single bond (Figure 7a).39,40 Time-dependent density-functional theory
(TD-DFT) calculations (using CAM-B3LYP/6-31+G*, polarizable continuum
model = toluene) confirmed that in toluene the ground state energy
of the s-cis isomer is 25.3 kJ/mol lower than the s-trans one (Supporting Information Table S1). Moreover, similar
to what was observed in both the gelation experiments (Figure 6) and the temperature-transient
measurements (Supporting Information Figure
S17), the TD-DFT calculation also confirms a Δλem ≈
30 nm between the two isomers with the s-cis conformer’s emission
being red-shifted (Supporting Information Table S1). Reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography–mass
spectrometry (RP-HPLC–MS) analysis supports this evidence,
showing that Oct-C1 exists as two chemically distinguishable
isomers having the same mass ([M–H]− = 576.3m/z), but clearly distinct retention times
(Supporting Information Figure S18). Interestingly,
the fibrillar architecture greatly affects this equilibrium in a highly
dynamic fashion: as shown in Figure 5d, at the very initial phase, (curve 1) the two rotamers
co-exist in a ∼1:1 ratio; this ratio slightly differs from
what was observed in pure toluene at high temperature (∼1:1.3,
s-cis/s-trans) in virtue of the presence of nascent R8 protofibrils in solution. As the system cools down, the s-cis isomer
becomes more and more abundant, which is in line with the temperature-transient
experiment (Supporting Information Figure
S17). Concurrently, as Oct-C1 molecules become incorporated
into elongating fibrils and the H-bond network of the latter becomes
more compact, the probe experiences steric hindrance (i.e., higher
local viscosity). This effect, in turn, induces an increased fluorescence
emission (Figure 5d,
curves 1–2) because of the decrease in nonradiative decay.
In the second phase (Figure 5d, curves 2–3), although the system is approaching
room temperature, the emission from the least thermodynamically stable
s-trans isomer unexpectedly rises and stabilizes indefinitely, indicating
that the isomeric equilibrium is significantly shifted toward this
form (final s-cis/s-trans ratio ≈ 1:1.3) (Figure 7). In addition to this, the
spectroscopic transition observed took place simultaneously with the
formation of chiral structures evident via AFM (Figures 3a and 6a–f)
and CD (Figure 2c).
To prove that Oct-C1 senses a rearrangement of the H-bond
network within the fibril’s sugar core, which is arguably at
the base of the fiber’s morphological change, we show via all-atom
simulations that the H-bond interactions between the gelators’
glucose hydroxyl groups and the coumarin portion are affected during
the structural transition. We found that the isomeric equilibrium
results highly perturbed as a consequence of the stabilization of
the s-trans isomer (Supporting Information Figure S19), which takes place through a three-H-bond network between
the lactone carbonyl and the cyano group, and two adjacent hydroxyl
groups of two spatially close glucose rings (Figure 7b, black dotted lines, and Supporting Information Figure S16). We can infer that the
interactions stabilizing the s-trans isomer are established only in
the fully formed fibers upon fine intermolecular rearrangements in
the local structure at the end of gelation, which, in turn, drives
the fiber maturation giving rise to double helices (Figure 6).

Figure 7 (a) Equilibrium between
the Z-s-cis and Z-s-trans rotational isomers
of Oct-C1. While the s-cis isomer is favored in nonpolar
solvents at RT (such as toluene), this equilibrium is significantly
shifted toward the s-trans isomer in the presence of the R8 gel network (R = octano-8-yl). (b) Top view of Z-s-trans Oct-C1 inserted within a gel fibril from a minimized all-atom MD snapshot.
The s-trans isomer form a three-H-bond network (black dotted lines
within blue circles) with the surrounding glucose rings which in turn,
stabilizes this conformation.

Discussion
Understanding of the dynamic nature of molecular
self-assembly
process has been carried out through careful design of molecular fluorescent
probes. The high selectivity of these fluorescent probes toward dynamic
and predictable structural changes is justified by their abilities
to investigate complex systems in situ without interfering with the
overall self-assembly process. In this work, we show that the real-time
changes in molecular self-assembly in a 3D network could be probed
by introducing ad hoc fluorescent rotors at submicromolar concentrations,
which intimately blend into the gelator’s nanostructure. The
ability of the viscoelastic media to modulate the fluorescence signal
from the probes in terms of both intensity and emission maxima provided
significant insights into the gelator’s self-assembly mechanism,
which was further corroborated with computational simulations. More
specifically, to the viscosity-sensitive core of the coumarin/stilbene
molecular rotor C1, we appended moieties that imparted
high chemical affinity between the stacked gelator molecules and consequently
underwent preferential spatial localization within individual fibrils.
MD simulation helped to determine these intermolecular interactions,
which ultimately plays a crucial role in unravelling the complexity
behind R8’s fiber formation. The two completely
distinct moieties, introduced into the probe C1 (i.e.,
glucose and octanoic acid), acted as molecular anchors allowing the
viscosity-sensing portion to be securely localized either right outside
of the fibrils’ hydrophobic layer or fully embedded within
the hydrophilic fibril core, respectively. Interestingly for Oct-C1, MD simulations also show that the free carboxylic
acid at the end of the aliphatic chain clearly interacts with the
gelator’s ketone group via the H-bond. This further increases
the level of interdigitation between the two molecules and may help
shed light on the subtle changes in fibrillar growth in gel systems,
as well as their systematic and often reversible responses to external
stimuli including radiation, shear, temperature, and more.

Because
of the instantaneous fluorescent response upon environmental
changes, we were able to utilize these probes to monitor the growth
of the nanofibrils in real-time. A particularly striking discovery
was related to the observation of solid-like viscosity values at the
interface of reversed fibrils where the hydrophobic tails reside.
This finding yields important insights into the nature of the interfibrillar
adhesive forces taking place within larger fibers. On the other hand, Oct-C1 revealed how 3-styryl-coumarin’s intrinsic s-cis/s-trans
rotational equilibrium can serve as a tool to monitor subtle intermolecular
interactions. In fact, we shed light on the intriguing multistep fibril
formation process underlying a rearrangement of the H-bond network
within the hydrophilic core that eventually leads to the generation
of double helices, as also confirmed by MDs simulations. Furthermore,
the intimate interaction between the gelator R8 and Oct-C1 is highlighted by the fact that during the gelation
process the latter experiences a drastic and highly dynamic alteration
of its isomeric equilibrium and corresponding fluorescence spectra.

Conclusions
In summary, by combining traditional material characterization
techniques and computer simulations with these stimuli-responsive
spectroscopic tools, we have demonstrated that it is possible to build
an accurate model for the dynamic assembly of the organogelator under
investigation. To do this, we first designed distinctive coumarin-based
molecular probes, which are complementary to the assembled low molecular
weight gelator’s dilute environment (1.0 wt % gelator in solution),
while also possessing specific chemical moieties included for the
specific interaction of the probe and the gelator structure. After
demonstrating the activity and responsivity of the probe and gel system
separately, we then tested the probes in the gel, and during gel formation
to examine self-assembly to help understand the process of architectural
growth and fiber formation. Fluorescent measurements served to characterize
the probe’s photophysical response to changes in viscosity
relating to the freedom or restriction of the probes intercalation
into the gel’s network. AFM and stimulated emission depletion
(STED) microscopy helped reveal the gel system’s architecture,
dynamic growth, and localization of the probe within the gel fibers.
To complement experimental work, computational investigations were
conducted to reveal both the gelators potential molecular arrangements,
and likely interactions and configurations between the different probes
and the gel. This allowed us to highlight the distinctive interactions
between the different probes and the assembled organogelator that
are in good agreement with the experimental work. We believe that
similar nano-sized tools can be designed to probe a vast array of
molecular and polymer-based nanostructured materials, allowing for
the future study in a broad range of applications.

Methods
Preparation
and Characterization of Molecular Gels
Gels were prepared
by adding the solid glassy glycosides (10.0–50.0
mg gelator) to toluene (1 mL). The mixture was then heated to disperse
the gelator at 5° below the boiling point of the solvents, to
produce a homogeneous sol. The sol was kept at this temperature for
5 min under constant agitation to fully disperse the gelator. The
sol was then allowed to cool to room temperature to allow for self-assembly.
No free flow of the 1% gels upon inversion was observed after 6 min.
The samples were inverted to confirm gel formation after 1 h.

Spectroscopic
Measurements
Samples (1500 μL)
were used in a quartz cuvette (Thorlabs, Newton, NJ) with an optical
path (l) of 1 cm. The temperature of the cell compartment
was set at 25 °C, by a built-in Peltier cooler (Varian). Absorption
data were recorded at 25 °C using 1 nm band pass, 1 nm resolution,
and 200 nm/min scanning speed. Fluorescence intensity measurements
were carried out at the absorption maximum of each compound, employing
an excitation and emission band pass of 2.5 nm, 120 nm/min scan rate
and 600 V PMT detector voltage. For every sample, the absorbance at
the wavelength maximum was recorded and subsequently employed to normalize
the corresponding fluorescence emission intensity.

Fluorescence
emission calibration curves of the three probes were obtained in toluene–PEG
methyl ether methacrylate mixtures at a final concentration of 400
nM.

The time-transient fluorescence emission measurements were
obtained
by adding the appropriate volume of a stock solution of the fluorophores
(C1, Glu-C1, and Oct-C1) in
hot R8 toluene solution (1% w/w) for a final concentration
of 200 nM. The cuvette was kept sealed with a Teflon cap throughout
the duration of the experiment to ensure no variations in concentration.

AFM Measurements
An R8 1% solution (w/v)
was prepared by adding the solid gelator to 3 mL of toluene (1 mL).
The mixture was then heated and stirred at 100 °C to produce
a homogeneous sol. Sample solutions (5 μL) were drop-casted
onto microscope cover glasses (Fisher Scientific, 12-542A, NY, NY)
that were kept at 50 °C on a hot plate. The time points considered
for AFM imaging were immediately after R8 completely
dissolved (time 0 min) and after 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, and 6 min. After
complete evaporation of the solvent (about 5 s), the samples were
further air-dried in a dust-free environment for 12 h and then glued
onto magnetic discs prior AFM imaging. The samples were scanned in
the ScanAssyst mode.

STED Measurements
An amount of 10
μL of 1% R8 toluene gel doped with either Glu-C1 or Oct-C1 (100 nM) was deposited onto
a microscope cover glass
kept at 50 °C on a hot plate to ensure quick evaporation of the
solvent. After further drying overnight at RT in a dust-free environment,
the samples were imaged.

RP-HPLC–MS Analysis
Oct-C1 was
analyzed with a gradient solvent system consisting of A (water with
0.1% formic acid) and B (acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid). The
flow rate was 250 μL/min and the gradient used was the following:
hold at 35% B for 3 min, then 35–90% B in 23 min, then 90–100%
B in 0.1 min, hold for 5.9 min and 100–35% B in 0.1 min, and
finally hold for 7.9 min. The oven temperature was 40 °C.
