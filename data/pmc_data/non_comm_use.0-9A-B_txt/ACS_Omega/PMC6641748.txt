Glycogen and starch are complex branched polymers of glucose that serve as units of glucose
storage in animals and plants, respectively. Changes in the structure
of these molecules have been linked to changes in their respective
functional properties. Enzymatic models of starch synthesis have provided
valuable insights into the biosynthetic origins of starch structure
and functional properties but have not successfully been applied to
glycogen despite the structural similarities between the two polymers.
Modifications to biosynthetic models of starch structure were tested
for applicability to glycogen. Mathematical evidence is provided showing
the necessity (which has hitherto been in doubt) of considering the
effects of catabolic (degradative) enzymes in biosynthesis-based approaches
that seek to accurately describe the molecular weight distributions
of individual chains of glycogen formed in vivo through glycogenesis.
This finding also provides future direction for inferring the dependence
of enzyme activities on substrate chain length from in vivo data.

1 Introduction
Glycogen is a highly branched polymer of glucose (also containing
a small but significant amount of protein1) consisting of linear chains formed by α-(1 → 4) linkages
with α-(1 → 6) linkages giving rise to branching points
at various intervals. Glycogen provides a unit of energy storage as
well as a method of controlling energy release in a myriad of organisms,2 and impairment of these functions in mammals
is a characteristic of numerous diseases, notably diabetes. As a link
has been shown to exist between changes in glycogen structure and
changes in the rate of energy release3 (important
in diabetes, which is characterized by loss of blood-sugar control4,5), the study of the structure of glycogen and the modeling of the
biosynthetic processes that give rise to it have been of increasing
interest in recent years.

Starch is a similar glucose polymer
to glycogen, also formed by
α-(1 → 4) and α-(1 → 6) linkages, and consists
of two types of component molecules: amylose, composed of relatively
few, long-chain branches, and amylopectin, with a comparatively large
number of short-chain branches. One of the most easily accessible
and useful structural properties that can be extracted from both glycogen
and starch is the chain-length distribution (CLD), the molecular abundance
of individual chains as measured by the relative number of chains
(denoted Nde, obtained by enzymatic debranching
of the parent branched molecule) of each degree of polymerization
(DP, denoted X) present in the polymer. This property
is most optimally collected using fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate
electrophoresis (FACE), a technique that can provide baseline resolution
of chain abundance up to DP 180.6,7 The CLD of amylopectin
has been extensively studied, and analysis of this structural information
has provided valuable insights into the underlying biosynthetic processes
that give rise to the polymer and has shed light on structure–property
relations.8 Using parametric models, differences
between amylopectin CLDs have been tied to changes in the activities
of the metabolic enzymes involved in amylopectin synthesis,8 sparking interest in using such models to investigate
the enzymatic processes involved in glycogenesis.

A previous
attempt was made to apply the biosynthetic model for
amylopectin developed by Wu et al.8 to
the study of glycogenesis, resulting in a failure to adequately represent
the shape of glycogen CLDs in terms of the activities of the enzymes
involved in starch biosynthesis.9 The differences
between the experimental data collected and the most similar distributions
allowed by the amylopectin model were ascribed in part to the postulate10 that hindrance is a significant chain-stopping
mechanism in glycogen, but other questions regarding the reasons for
this discrepancy remain. The strategy employed in this previous attempt
retained several assumptions about amylopectin that are uncertain
or untrue in the case of glycogen, possibly contributing, along with
the effects of hindrance, to the inconsistency between theoretical
and experimental results. Herein, we explore the viability of modifying
this approach to more accurately reflect the biosynthetic processes
involved in glycogenesis with the goal of successfully parameterizing
glycogen CLDs in terms of the biosynthetic enzymes involved.

2 Methods
As in the previous attempt mentioned, the biosynthetic
model developed
by Wu et al. was chosen as a basis for modification due to its excellent
parametric fits for amylopectin.8 This
technique models CLDs using a system of differential equations containing
terms representing the action of each of the enzymes involved in amylopectin
biosynthesis and then solves the matrix form of these equations (which
represent the molecular weight distributions of the individual chains
of the polymer) using numerical methods to find the number of chains
of each DP present for a given set of parameters. Three types of enzymes
are considered in the amylopectin model: starch synthase, which linearly
adds monomers, starch debranching enzyme, which removes entire chain
branches, and starch branching enzyme, which splits branches that
meet a certain minimum length and then reattaches the snipped segment
as a new branch on either a nearby chain or the stub chain formed
by the reaction. Minimum chain length requirements for the stub portion
to be retained (X0) as well as the snipped
portion to be detached (Xmin) by the branching
enzyme are specified as parameters, as is the ratio of branching enzyme
to synthase activities (β) and the ratio of debranching enzyme
to synthase activities (γ). The model also allows for multiple
isoform sets of all three enzymes considered, each with different
values of X0, Xmin, β, and γ. As all activities are measured relative to
those of synthase, no parameter representing the activity of synthase
is needed.

In several species of plants, the normalized CLD
of amylopectin
in storage organs (e.g., cereal grains) has been shown to be invariant
with time for a given plant.11−13 Despite total amounts of the
polymer (as represented by the magnitude of the CLD) and relative
rates of synthesis and degradation changing throughout the diurnal
cycle, this finding shows that the relative abundance of chains of
each DP is invariant with time. This allows for what is referred to
in the work of Wu et al. as the steady-state assumption (the assumption
that the normalized observed CLD in a sample is independent of the
time of measurement) and allows for the time-independent form of the
equations of Wu et al. to be used, greatly simplifying the process
of finding solutions. Although it is not yet known whether the CLD
of glycogen is in a steady state, the previous attempt to apply this
model to glycogen retained this assumption.9 As glycogen synthase (GS) is a functional analogue of starch synthase14 and glycogen branching enzyme (GBE) is a functional
analogue of starch branching enzyme,15 the
previous treatment logically retained the original representation
of these enzymes in the model. Additionally, however, the previous
modeling attempt also retained the original representation of starch debranching
enzyme, of which there is no known analogue in glycogen (despite their
similar names, glycogen debranching enzyme, abbreviated GDBE, performs
a fundamentally different role to starch debranching enzyme and functions
as both a glucanotransferase and a glucosidase,16 acting only on substrates of DP 4 and transferring a DP
3 chain linearly to the end of an existing chain), as well as the
possibility of multiple isoforms of GS and GBE, which have not been
shown to exist in vivo. These differences between the two compounds
may have, along with the effects of hindrance, contributed in part
to the observed discrepancy previously reported.9

In light of the aforementioned, hitherto unrepresented,
differences
between amylopectin and glycogen metabolism, the first new strategy
employed was to disallow multiple enzyme isoforms in the model and
to set γ = 0 to effectively remove the debranching enzyme from
the system (all variable names have been retained from the previous
treatment). This approach would leave single isoforms of GS and GBE
as the only enzymes in the system and would not consider the action
of any catabolic enzymes, which have previously been hypothesized
to be unnecessary to describe the processes in glycogenesis that give
rise to glycogen structure in vivo.9 Numerical
solutions of the matrix equations representing the system followed
similar methods to those used by Wu and Gilbert,17 including ensuring that coefficient matrices used were
sufficiently large as to reduce the appearance of numerical artifacts
from instability in the solving method to acceptable levels. As it
has long been postulated that hindrance stops the growth of glycogen
by way of hindering the action of the metabolic enzymes to the point
where they can no longer perform their functions10 (a hypothesis supported by the observed spontaneous termination
of the growth of synthetic glycogen in vitro in the presence of only
GS and GBE18), this method would represent
these hindrance effects as a reduction of the activity of the synthetic
enzymes and then adjust the functional forms for these reductions
in activities until the characteristic features of typical experimental
glycogen CLDs were observed. As will be demonstrated, this approach
was not able to be successfully employed and further modifications
to the model were required.

3 Results and Discussion
It was found that this first modification of the model could not
yield positive (and therefore valid) values for chain abundance within
the typical experimentally accessible range for glycogen CLDs (above
DP ≈ 60, the number of chains ordinarily present in glycogen
samples is so low as to cause the signal-to-noise ratio of the data
to become unacceptably poor) regardless of the values of the parameters
chosen. The cause of this was the ratio of β to γ falling
within the physically impossible range, as described by Wu and Gilbert.17 Values of γ low enough to push the ratio
of these two variables into this range (e.g., γ = 0) cause the
CLD calculated under the steady-state assumption to reach negative
values, with negative values appearing earlier in the distribution
with lower values of γ (Figure 1). This result shows that the CLDs of systems with
γ = 0 cannot be found using the steady-state solutions of the
model of Wu et al., necessitating the exploration of other approaches.

Figure 1 Plot of
theoretical CLDs calculated using the modified Wu et al.
model. All series were generated using the following parameters from
an example of amylopectin modeling:17X0 = 4, Xmin = 7,
β = 0.21511746, whereas the original value of γ (0.09329577)
was varied to illustrate the appearance of negative values of Nde at different points in the CLD depending
on the value of γ selected (listed in the legend). All series
are normalized to have the same maximum value to illustrate the qualitative
changes in the shape of the CLD with variations in γ. We note parenthetically that although it is usually best
to use a logarithmic Y axis for such data, in this
particular case, this confers no advantage. A plot
of these data without normalization is available in Supporting Information.

Although glycogen not being in a steady state is a possible
explanation
for the previous result, it is important to note that even for values
of γ incompatible with a steady state (i.e., in the physically
impossible range), no values selected could generate chains of DP
below the lower of the two product length requirements of GBE (X0 and Xmin) regardless
of whether the CLD obtained corresponded to a physically possible
steady-state solution (Figure 1). In view of this, and as
there were still several unaccounted-for differences between the biosynthetic
properties of the metabolic enzymes of amylopectin and glycogen that
could be responsible for the observations, further alternatives within
the realm of steady-state solutions were explored.

Considering
that growth of synthetic glycogen is observed to spontaneously
terminate in vitro in the presence of only GS and GBE,18 it was deemed prudent to determine which values
of enzyme activities would be necessary to yield experimentally observed
CLDs as results with the steady-state condition still enforced under
assumptions more appropriate for the case of glycogen. To this end,
γ was set equal to zero, a single isoform set was assumed for
both GS and GBE, and values of X0 and Xmin consistent with those observed for GBE in
vitro (6 and 7, respectively) were selected (although these observations
did not allow for differentiation between X0 and Xmin, they did determine that the
lower of the two values is 6 and the other one is probably 6 or 7).19 β was allowed to vary depending on the
DP (X) of the substrate chain being acted upon, and
values of β(X) were found by modifying the
matrix form of the equations used by Wu et al. so that the solution
vector consisted of β values for each DP value (X) and the coefficient matrix contained experimental values for chain
abundance (denoted N(X) in matrix
form rather than Nde(X) for visual simplicity). Remaining terms that were independent of
β were shifted to the (previously zero) solution vector (eq 1) 1  

This strategy is qualitatively
different from that used by Wu, Gilbert, and co-workers in previous
treatments.8,17 Specifically, instead of assuming
values for X0, Xmin, β, and γ and then adjusting them to fit experimental
data, experimental data are here used to directly calculate β(X) with γ = 0 and for assumed values of X0 and Xmin from interpretation
of in vitro experiments. This yields the dependence of β on the DP of the substrate, which was
assumed to be constant in the treatment of Wu et al. for want of applicable experimental data on this dependence (although
more recent experiments strongly suggest such a dependence exists19).

By retaining the assumptions that synthase
activity is invariant
with substrate DP and that all valid products of the reaction of the
branching enzyme with a substrate of a given DP have an equal probability
of being formed, this method was applied to create a system of equations
in matrix form (eq 1).
As is evident through a cursory visual inspection, the system cannot
be solved due to the coefficient matrix being singular. Although this
may seem paradoxical, as solutions (albeit physically impossible ones)
to systems with the same values of X0, Xmin, and γ can be found using the method
of Wu et al., the replacement of constant values of β with β(X) and the use of Nde(X) as input parameters rather than as the solution qualitatively
alters the system. By design, the terms representing the loss of chains
due to the branching enzyme using them as substrate are not included
in the differential equations for chains of DP < X0 + Xmin, as the branching
enzyme is assumed not to be able to act on those chains. Consequently,
after allowing β to vary with X and converting
the equations representing the system to matrix form (eq 1), the system has no dependence
on the values of β(X) for 1 ≤ X < X0 + Xmin and thus solutions for these variables cannot be found.
The system does, however, have a dependence on values of β(X) for X ≥ X0 + Xmin, and solutions in this
range can be found analytically by truncating the matrix form of the
system (Supporting Information) to eliminate
the differential equations containing β(X)
for 1 ≤ X < X0 + Xmin (1 ≤ X < 13 in the example given in eq 1).

After first finding analytical solutions for
a system with a maximum
DP of 50, experimental glycogen CLDs (Figure 2) were used to calculate values of β(X) for X ≥ X0 + Xmin (Figure 3). It was found that all calculated values
of β(X) in this range were positive and therefore
physically possible, although caution should be exercised in interpreting
the exact values calculated using this treatment as both the assumptions
that the activity of GS has no substrate-length dependence and all
valid products of the reaction of GBE on a substrate of a given DP
have an equal probability of formation were still in effect.

Figure 2 Experimental Nde distributions9 used to calculate substrate-dependent values
for β. Series have been normalized to the same maximum in arbitrary
units. Although these data consist of discrete points for each DP,
they have been shown here as continuous lines for visual ease.

Figure 3 Dependence of β(X) on
substrate DP (X) for the CLDs presented in Figure 2 as calculated using
the truncated form of eq 1. All calculations were
performed using the following parameters: X0 = 6, Xmin = 7, and a maximum DP of 50
considered. Oscillatory behavior was shown to be artifactual and caused
by noise in experimental CLDs used as input data rather than instability
in the solving method (Supporting Information).

It has been hypothesized that
the action of the branching enzyme
can be modeled more realistically by allowing it to act on chains
shorter than its substrate-length requirement (X0 + Xmin) at a reduced rate.17 This is easily incorporable into this new treatment
by way of removing restrictions on X0 and Xmin, albeit with some caveats. As discussed
previously, the data obtained from FACE at DP 1–2 are generally
considered unsuitable for interpretation and therefore it is unwise
to include terms containing Nde(X), where X ≤ 2. To exclude terms
representing chains of these lengths from the system, the parameter
values X0 = 3 and Xmin = 3 were selected. If the CLD of glycogen is both in a
steady state and able to be explained through the action of solely
GS and GBE (and hindrance effects reducing the activity of these two
enzymes), the values of β(X) found by solving
this system should decay sharply at X ≲ 13
(the approximate sum of the experimentally inferred values of X0 and Xmin).

This was not found to be the case (Figure 4), as the solution to the system mandates
high values of β(X) in this DP to account for the abundance
of DP < 6 chains observed ubiquitously in glycogen CLDs, with changes
in X0, Xmin, as well as the highest DP considered in the system having no influence
on the appearance of this trend (Supporting Information). This calculated result is inconsistent with experiments, where
no significant change in the abundance of chains of DP < 6 chains
was observed even after prolonged treatment of a substrate of a known
distribution with GBE in vitro19 (which,
in the context of the model, fixes the lower of the two values between X0 and Xmin at 6).
This suggests that these short (DP < 6) chains arise out of the
action of an enzyme other than GS and GBE, likely one or both of the
two chain-shortening catabolic enzymes (glycogen phosphorylase,20 abbreviated GP, and α-glucosidase,21 abbreviated GAA) known to be involved in glycogen
metabolism. Although this may seem counterintuitive, as GS can theoretically
give rise to chains of DP > 2 through elongation of chains, the
substrate
for these reactions cannot be provided by GBE, which can only produce
chains as short as DP 6. Therefore, all substrates for reactions that
proceed on chains of DP < 6 (such as the aforementioned elongation
by GS) must arise from chain-shortening processes, such as the action
of GP or GAA.

Figure 4 Dependence of β(X) on substrate
DP (X) for the CLDs presented in Figure 2 as calculated from the truncated
form of eq 1 (Supporting Information). All calculations were performed using the following
parameters: X0 = 3, Xmin = 3, and a maximum DP of 40 considered.

Indeed, assays of enzyme activity from mouse liver
samples show
a significant level of glycogen phosphorylase activity at various
points in the diurnal cycle22 during periods
of both glycogen accumulation and depletion,23 strengthening the case for including catabolic enzymes in the model
despite their omission from previous modeling and simulation work.3,9 To test what effects the addition of these catabolic enzymes would
have on the calculated values of β(X), terms
representing GP and GAA activity were added to the model. These enzymes
essentially perform an opposite function to GS, shortening linear
chains by removing one monomer at a time (although the action of GP
stalls four monomers away from branch points, GAA is not known to
suffer any such restriction20). Terms of
the same form as that of GS (with reversed signs) representing the
action of GP and GAA were added to the model, yielding a new coefficient
matrix (Supporting Information), which
was then manipulated once again to solve for values of β(X).

It was found that, despite their subtly different
implementations
in the model, the individual values of the ratio of GP to GS activity
(δ) and the ratio of GAA to GS activity (ε) had no effect
on the values of β(X) calculated, even with
values of X0 and Xmin as low as 3 being used as parameters, with only the sum
of δ and ε affecting the results obtained (Supporting Information). The values of the sum
of δ and ε were varied to determine if changes in these
parameters could reverse the trend observed in Figure 4, where values of β(X) were observed to increase sharply below the experimentally established
value of X0 + Xmin. Although sufficiently high values of δ + ε were successful
in causing a decay in the value of β(X) at
low DP, they did so at the cost of causing β(X) to take on negative (and thus physically impossible) values (Figure 5). This is possibly
a result of issues arising from the retention of the assumption of
equal product formation probability for GBE and the lack of consideration
of GDBE in this treatment.

Figure 5 Effects of the addition of terms representing
the action of chain-shortening
enzymes on the values of β(X) previously calculated
in Figure 4. Sufficiently
large sums of δ + ε, in this case, δ + ε =
30, cause values of β(X) to decay at low values
of X, consistent with physical predictions, although
other, unknown, factors cause β(X) to take
on disallowed negative values at higher values of δ + ε
(Supporting Information).

Due to the action of GDBE depending on two values
of Nde(X), one for the
chain acted upon by
the glucosidase function of the enzyme and another for the chain acted
upon during the subsequent glucanotransferase reaction, equations
representing the action of GDBE would contain nonlinear terms and
are not compatible with models of this nature. Neglecting to include
a representation of GDBE in this treatment, however, is unlikely to
qualitatively change the observed trend in the value of β(X) due to its action being mathematically indistinguishable
from a loss of DP 4 chains and linear addition of monomers analogous
to the action of GS. Thus, it is likely that calculated values of
β(X) using a model that was able to successfully
represent GDBE would depend primarily on the sum of GS and GDBE activity,
rather than the individual values, similar to the case in this treatment,
where only the sum of δ and ε impacted the values of β(X) obtained.

4 Conclusions
A qualitative
re-treatment of the steady-state solutions of the
model developed by Wu et al. has been developed, as the original treatment
cannot adequately describe glycogen CLDs. The new treatment enables
an assumption made in the absence of detailed information in the original
treatment to be overturned: instead of using a constant value of the
enzyme-activity ratio β and varying this value to fit data via
trial-and-error method, the new methods calculates the dependence of
β on DP through a novel means of processing experimental in
vivo data.

Application of this technique to experimental glycogen
CLDs yielded
results that showed that chain-shortening events in vivo, probably
caused by the action of the catabolic enzymes glycogen phosphorylase
and/or α-glucosidase, must be responsible for the presence of
chains shorter than the minimum product length requirement for GBE
that has been demonstrated in vitro (Table 1). Although this result does not cast doubt
on previous conclusions of hindrance being a major contributor of
chain stoppage in glycogen, hindrance can only explain eventual stoppage
of chain growth (and thus, growth of the molecule) and cannot explain
the chain-shortening processes that the present work has demonstrated
must be occurring to yield the CLDs experimentally observed.

a Although short chains (DP 2–6)
can arise from the action of GS, they must do so by using chains of
DP 1–5 as substrates. As chains of DP 1–3 can only arise
from the action of GAA and chains of DP 4–5 can only arise
from the action of GP, GAA, or GDBE, this necessitates the consideration
of these catabolic enzymes (GP, GAA, and GDBE) in future attempts
to represent the biosynthetic origins of glycogen CLDs, given that
chains of DP 1–5 are ubiquitously observed in analyzed samples.

Future work is needed to elucidate
any substrate preferences of
the other metabolic enzymes considered in the model and to determine
the product preferences of the reaction of GBE so these calculated
substrate preferences of GBE can be more meaningfully interpreted.
Before the effects of hindrance can be incorporated into future biosynthetic
models of this nature, the effects of catabolic enzymes capable of
giving rise to these short chains, as well as GDBE (which is capable
of removing DP 4 chains and subsequently elongating chains of any
length via a glucanotransferase reaction) must be considered. Doing
this will open the possibility of finding functional forms for the
enzyme-specific effects of hindrance as a function of localized density,
advancing understanding of the processes underlying glycogen biosynthesis
and their relationship to glycogen-storage diseases, such as diabetes.
