The strength of intraprotein interactions
or contact network is
one of the dominant factors determining the thermodynamic stabilities
of proteins. The nature and the extent of connectivity of this network
also play a role in allosteric signal propagation characteristics
upon ligand binding to a protein domain. Here, we develop a server
for rapid quantification of the strength of an interaction network
by employing an experimentally consistent perturbation approach previously
validated against a large data set of 375 mutations in 19 different
proteins. The web server can be employed to predict the extent of
destabilization of proteins arising from mutations in the protein
interior in experimentally relevant units. Moreover, coupling distances—a
measure of the extent of percolation on perturbation—and overall
perturbation magnitudes are predicted in a residue-specific manner,
enabling a first look at the distribution of energetic couplings in
a protein or its changes upon ligand binding. We show specific examples
of how the server can be employed to probe for the distribution of
local stabilities in a protein, to examine changes in side chain orientations or packing before and
after ligand binding, and to predict changes in stabilities of proteins
upon mutations of buried residues. The web server is freely available
at http://pbl.biotech.iitm.ac.in/pPerturb and supports recent versions of all major browsers.

Introduction
The network of noncovalent interactions
in the protein interior
primarily determines the thermodynamic stability of proteins.1−3 These evolutionarily fine-tuned intraprotein interaction networks
or contact networks display a range of local and nonlocal connectivity,
thus determining protein local stability and folding mechanisms. Studies
on designed proteins4 and natural sensory
proteins5 highlight that it is this network
of interactions that determines the stability and tunability upon solvent perturbations.
Allosteric signals from a perturbation (ligand binding, mutation,
and post-translational modification) also propagate through these
contact networks, thus determining the functional output.6−10 In fact, recent works suggest that modulating packing interactions
in the protein interior affect the ligand-binding affinity on the
protein surface.11 A central theme in a
majority of these approaches is that the interaction network is extremely
pliable, contributing to the evolution of proteins, their functionality,12,13 and cooperativity in protein folding thermodynamics14,15 and even manifests as disease due to changes in the stability.16

Recent works combining graph-theoretic
analysis of protein structures, all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations,
re-analysis of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experimental data
on perturbations point to an intricate connection between the packing
density (i.e. the distribution of local and nonlocal interactions)
and the extent of percolation of a signal.9,17−19 They highlight that distance constraints alone can
provide a simple avenue to look for allosteric hotspots. The major
conclusions of the above work have also been validated through extensive
analysis of anisotropic network models20 and experimental dissection of stability–disease effects
in three different proteins.21 Here, we
extend these theoretical results and experimental observations into
a web server that can be used to rapidly predict strongly interacting
residues, distribution of energetic coupling across the protein structure,
and residue-specific parameters that shed light on potential allosteric
hotspots and residues that likely determine cooperativity. The server
can also be employed to predict the degree of destabilization in proteins
upon mutations involving side chain truncation of uncharged residues
in the protein interior.

Computational Methods
Perturbation Protocol
Mutations in the interior of
a protein are generally assumed to affect only the nearest neighbors
(say, within 5–6 Å). However, analysis of MD simulations
of several mutants of Ubiquitin suggest that the van der Waals (vdW)
packing interactions are distinctly affected at positions 10–15
Å from the perturbed site, and hence the second shell of residues,
but decay in an exponential manner.17 A
large-scale analysis of NMR data corroborates simulations and reveals
that any mutational perturbation contributes to distinct changes in
the chemical shift pattern (and thus the electronic environment) even
at residues 10–20 Å from the side of perturbation, following
a similar exponential pattern.18 Inspired
by this, we developed a simple relation that connects mutational effects
to the strength of packing by recasting the van der Waals interaction
energy (EvdW) in terms of the extent to
which the first- and second-shell neighbors are affected (x1 and x2, respectively)
and the nature of the perturbation (i.e., whether V to A or I to A
mutation, for example).17 These statements
can be written in the form 1  Here, i is the mutated residue
and j and k refer to the first-
and second-shell neighbors, respectively. The nature of the perturbation
is introduced via nmut/nWT, which corresponds to the ratio of the number of heavy
atoms in the mutated residue to that in the wild-type (WT) residue.
The van der Waals interaction energy per residue can be estimated
either from statistical mechanical models or all-atom MD simulations,
as shown before.17 In this case, values
for x1 and x2 were estimated by introducing the above relation into the Wako–Saitô–Muñoz–Eaton
(WSME) statistical mechanical model22−24 and varying both the
interaction cutoff (4–6 Å for both first and second shells)
and the magnitudes of x1 and x2 (0–1). By generating more than 100 000
unfolding curves for 375 mutants from 19 different proteins, we arrived
at values of 0.5 and 0.2 for x1 and x2 (at equal 6 Å radius for first- and second-shell
residues), respectively; this involved looking for consistency in
three dimensions involving the slope of the plot of experimental versus
predicted change in stability (ΔΔG),
mean absolute error (MAE), and the correlation coefficient.17Equation 1 can also be written in terms of contacts, Q, extracted from the contact map as 2  where ΔQ is the extracted
perturbation. Equations 1 and 2 are directly related as the van der
Waals interaction energy terms in eq 1 can be simply represented as the product of mean-field
interaction energy and the number of pairwise atomic-level contacts
(Q) between residue pairs and assuming that the mean-field
interaction energy itself is not affected by the mutation. A residue-level contact map (Q terms in eq 2) can be constructed by
counting the number of heavy-atom interactions between residues within
a 6 Å spherical cutoff, which is conventionally done in nearly
all Go̅-type (native-centric) models of protein folding. This
equation alone captures the exponential pattern seen in experiments,
thus attesting to its usefulness.19Equation 2 can be employed
to perform in silico alanine-scanning mutagenesis to probe for the
strength of the interaction network across different parts of the
protein as recently performed on three proteins implicated in diseases.21

Web Server Description
The overall
features of the
pPerturb web server are depicted in Figure 1. Briefly, the server accepts PDB ID/file
as input from the user (protein length, N ≤
400) following which it perturbs specific residues or the entire protein
based on the experimentally consistent empirical eqs 1 and 2. The perturbation
involves truncation of side chains to alanine and in the case of alanine
(glycine) to glycine (a virtual three-atom residue) while maintaining
two shells of interaction around the perturbed site. The effect of
perturbation (written as ΔQ) will be felt at
a distance based on the extent to which the perturbed residue is connected
to its immediate neighbors or the strength of the interaction network.
The ΔQ thus extracted is plotted as a function
of distance from the perturbed site and fitted to an exponential function,
thus providing an important parameter, the coupling distance, dC, that captures the extent to which the perturbation
has percolated (in a strict equilibrium sense) into the interaction
network. The amplitude of the exponential function and the overall
perturbation magnitude (∑ΔQ) provide
additional information on the network features including the magnitude
of perturbation and the number of interactions that are perturbed
in the immediate neighborhood, respectively.19 If specific regions of the structure are strongly coupled to each
other, then the ∑ΔQ will be larger and
vice versa.9 The output is generated in
a rapid manner; for example, the results for a 400-residue protein
can be generated in just ∼4 min.

Figure 1 Flowchart depicting the
organization of modules in the pPerturb
web server. Once the protein structure is loaded into the server,
perturbation profiles at the level of individual residues are generated
for individual residues using eq 2, following which residue-specific parameters are provided
for selected residues (perturbation profile) or all residues in the
protein (interaction network profile). The residue-specific parameters
are then colored on the protein structure to generate publication-quality
images. Users can also request the prediction of changes in stability
involving truncation mutations of uncharged residues wherein the mutational
effects are introduced via eq 2. The model output can be downloaded as text files or high-resolution
images.

The outputs from the server can
be readily accessed as a text file
or a graph. In addition to these, we map ∑ΔQ and/or dC on to the protein structure,
enabling the download of publication-quality images in user-specified
orientations, dimensions, and resolutions. These images afford a direct
visualization of the residues that are affected upon mutation of a
particular residue and can be particularly useful for biologists to
understand mutational effects. Users can also input multimeric structures
and perturb residues at the interface to explore the nonisotropic
percolation of perturbations into the different subunits. It is also
possible to compare the changes in intramolecular interaction networks
of the same protein at two different states (for example, in the absence
and presence of a ligand/cofactor) by uploading the respective protein
structures. Following this, the user is given the option of predicting
equilibrium unfolding curves from the Wako–Saitô–Muñoz–Eaton
(WSME) model assuming an ensemble of 2N conformational states22−25 for the truncation mutations involving uncharged
residues. This method thus serves as a good starting point for identifying
mutations that can precisely alter protein stabilities or to identify
regions of structure that primarily contribute to thermodynamic stabilities.
For mutations involving charged residues, the user is directed to
our pStab web server for predicting changes in stabilities.26

Results and Discussion
Visualization of Local
Stability or Interaction Network Profiles
We take the challenging
case of neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1,
a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR)) characterized by seven transmembrane
helices (TM1–TM7, Figure 2A). Recent experimental studies point to an activation
mechanism involving structural changes in TM5 and TM6.27 To identify any intrinsic differences in packing
density, the perturbation protocol was applied to all residues in
the protein and the resulting total perturbation magnitude (∑ΔQ) was mapped on to the structure. We employ ∑ΔQ rather than dC as the former
does not require recourse to fitting routines, thus reducing any error
arising from potential nonexponential decays. The structure is colored
in the spectral scale with red and blue representing strong and weak
coupling, respectively. It can be seen that the color map of ∑ΔQ is varied with the majority of the buried residues displaying
strong coupling (red to green), while those on the lipid-exposed sites
are weakly coupled (blue). Interestingly, we find that TM helices
5 and 6 are weakly coupled to the rest of the structure (not apparent
in Figure 2A), thus
suggesting that any early structural changes during unfolding or conformational
transitions are potentially localized to these regions, in good agreement
with experiments.27

Figure 2 Structural model of GPCR
NTSR1 (PDB 6OS9) without (panel A) and with ∑ΔQ mapped
on to the structure (panel B). The structure in
panel B is colored in the spectral scale between the two extremes
of well-packed residues (red) and weakly packed residues (blue). Note
the stretch of dark blue in the TM helices 5 and 6 pointing to weak
packing.

Structural Changes on Ligand
Binding
Many proteins
undergo minor or major structural changes on ligand binding, contributing
to allosteric effects. Identifying regions that have undergone structural
changes requires calculating root-mean-squared deviation (RMSD), a
parameter that is agnostic to whether a specific region transitions
to a more strongly or weakly packed state on ligand binding. The pPerturb
web server provides precisely this information while also accounting
for second-shell effects, which we present in Figure 3 in terms of ligand binding to the proteins
bACBP, phosphofructokinase (PFK), and PDZ3.28−30 In each case,
we color residues in the spectral scale and depending on whether residues
pack stronger (red) or weaker (blue) on ligand binding, as calculated
from ∑ΔQb – ∑ΔQu, where b and u stand for ligand-bound and
-unbound conformations of the protein, respectively. Perturbation
analysis shows that that the packing of a large number of residues
is affected by ligand binding in all of the three cases considered,
in agreement with experiments on PDZ3.31 In PDZ3, residues that exhibit high ∑ΔQ difference or Z-scored ∑ΔQ values greater than 1 highlight a connection between the ligand-binding
site (peptide colored in magenta in Figure 3B, middle column) and the phosphorylation
site located at the helix-sheet overhang of PDZ3 (residue Y92), exactly
as observed in experiments (note the red spheres in Figure 3B, middle column).32 It is important to emphasize here that our approach
does not provide any signal transduction routes but can hint at likely
connectivity patterns based on which graph-theoretic tools can be
employed to construct signal propagation paths. Moreover, the ligands
are not considered in this analysis as ligand binding manifests as
changes in packing or coupling, which we extract through perturbation
of the conformation that the protein adopts on ligand binding.

Figure 3 Left column
presents a superimposition of ligand/inhibitor-unbound
and -bound structures of the proteins bACBP (PDB ids 2ABD/1ACA for ligand-unbound
and -bound states), PDZ3 (1BFE/1BE9), and PFK (3PFK/6PFK for inhibitor-unbound
and -bound states) in gray and light brown, respectively. The overall
RMSD values (including Cα and side chain) between
the bound (b) and unbound (u) forms are 2.3, 1.1, and 1.6 Å,
respectively. The cartoons in the middle and right columns are colored
in the spectral scale (red to blue as in the color bar provided) according
to ∑ΔQb – ∑ΔQu. Spheres represent the Cα atoms of specific residues whose difference in ∑ΔQ fall in the extremes, with Z-score ≥
1 in the middle column and Z-score ≤ −1
in the right column. Note that such vivid details in terms of packing
differences (middle and right columns) cannot be extracted from structural
superimposition alone (left column).

Predicting Stability Changes on Truncation Mutations
Since
the perturbation protocol relies on modulation of van der Waals
interactions, it is straightforward to predict stability changes by
introducing eq 1 into
the WSME model, as discussed before. We had already shown that the
changes in stabilities are predicted with a slope near 1 and a correlation
coefficient of 0.7 for a database of 375 mutations.17 In Figure 4, we show an illustrative example of the differences in stability
arising from progressively weaker packing of I → V →
A → G mutations in Ubiquitin. The prediction of the WT and
mutant unfolding curves takes just ∼2 min in the web server.
The protocol involves adjusting the van der Waals interaction energy
iteratively to reproduce the experimental melting temperature of the
WT at the user-specified pH and ionic strength, following which the
perturbation protocol (eq 1) is employed to generate unfolding curves of the mutants. The user
is also provided an option of choosing between a uniform entropic
penalty for all residues and an entropic penalty that depends on either
the residue identity (for glycine and proline) or the presence in
a specific secondary structure element (helix and strand versus coil).

respectively. (B) Unfolding curves predicted by the WSME model for
mutations at position 30 at pH 7.0 and 20 mM ionic strength by employing
a 6 Å heavy-atom contact cutoff including the nearest neighbors.

Conclusions
We have developed a
multifaceted web server that performs rapid
alanine-scanning mutagenesis to probe for the strength of the interaction
network accounting for both local and nonlocal interactions in an
experimentally consistent manner. The rapidity of the method enables
simultaneous prediction of multiple residue-level parameters with
implications in identifying pockets of residues that determine local
stability and potential allosteric signal transduction paths and in
predicting destabilization induced by mutations in the protein interior.
The simplicity of our protocol, on the other hand, allows for a tremendous
scope in the improvement of the web server to account for residue-specific
energy terms and conformational entropy dependent on both the residue
identity and secondary structure type.
