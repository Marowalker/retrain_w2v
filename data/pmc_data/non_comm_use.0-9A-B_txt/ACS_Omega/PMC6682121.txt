Cysteine
(Cys) is important in biosynthesis, detoxification, and
metabolism. The selective detection of Cys over structurally similar
homocysteine (Hcy) or glutathione (GSH) remains an immense challenge.
Although there are many methods for detecting Cys, photoluminescence
(PL) and electrochemiluminescence (ECL) techniques are well-suited
for clinical diagnostics and analytical technology because of their
high sensitivities. Herein, we report PL and ECL dual-channel sensors
using cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes for the discrimination
of Cys from Hcy and GSH. The sensors react with cysteine preferentially
because of kinetic differences in intramolecular conjugate addition/cyclization,
enabling phosphorescence enhancement and ECL decrease in the blue-shifted
region. Sensor 1 shows ratiometric PL turn-on and ECL
turn-off for Cys. In addition, unique ECL-enhancing behavior of sensor 1 toward GSH enables discrimination between Cys and GSH. Sensor 1 was successfully applied to the detection of Cys in human
serum by the ECL method. We demonstrate the first case of a Cys-selective
PL and ECL dual-channel chemodosimetric sensor based on cyclometalated
iridium(III) complexes and expect that the rational design of efficient
PL and ECL dual-channel sensors will be useful in diagnostic technology.

Introduction
Biothiols such as cysteine
(Cys), homocysteine (Hcy), and glutathione
(GSH) perform important roles in biological systems.1 Cys is related to detoxification, protein synthesis, and
metabolism.2 Elevated levels of Cys are
often found in patients with neurotoxicity3 and schizophrenia.4 The lack of Cys is
associated with slow growth, hair depigmentation, edema, exhaustion,
liver impairment, reduced muscles and fats, skin lesion, and feebleness.5 At the same time, irregular levels of Hcy are
related to cardiovascular disease6 and
Alzheimer’s disease.7 Because Cys
and Hcy are related to different diseases, the selective detection
of Cys or Hcy is of great importance in clinical aspects; however,
this has remained a great challenge because of their structural similarities.

Although various detection methods for Cys have been developed
including high-performance liquid chromatography, gas chromatography,
electrophoresis, and electrochemical methods,8−12 a fluorescent chemodosimetric sensing method has
attracted attention because of its simple operation, high selectivity,
and rapid response to target analytes, thereby enabling real-time
monitoring and imaging.13 One of the best
known chemodosimetric approaches for detecting Cys is based on conjugate
addition/cyclization using the acrylate group as the reaction site.
An acrylate connected to a fluorophore effectively quenches the fluorescence
of the fluorophore by photoinduced electron transfer (PET).14 However, the conjugate addition of Cys to acrylates
followed by intramolecular cyclization of the resulting addition product
leads to the recovery of intrinsic fluorescence. Most studies using
this strategy utilize organic dyes,14−16 which suffer from limitations
such as small Stokes shifts and poor photochemical/electrochemical
stability.

We selected phosphorescent iridium complexes as electrochemiluminescence
(ECL) luminophores because of their long emission lifetimes, large
Stokes shifts, high quantum efficiencies, thermal stabilities,17 and electrochemical stability.18−20 For these reasons, a lot of iridium-complex-based sensors for biothiols
have been developed.21−34 ECL is a chemiluminescence phenomenon that occurs by electron transfer
reactions between radical ions generated by electrochemical oxidation–reduction
reactions at the working electrode.35,36 Since ECL
does not need a light source, it has advantages of high sensitivity
and device miniaturization. Therefore, ECL is a powerful candidate
for the point-of-care testing of diagnostic biomarkers. Recently,
ECL has been successfully utilized to image single cells and their
membrane proteins.37 We expect that the
introduction of reaction sites to iridium-complex-based photoluminescence
(PL) and ECL luminophores can provide effective and powerful sensing
tools for specific biomarkers in clinical diagnosis. In this study,
we report PL and ECL dual-channel chemodosimetric sensors using cyclometalated
iridium(III) complexes for the discrimination of Cys from other biothiols
such as Hcy and glutathione (GSH) (Scheme 1).

of Cysteine (Cys) Using 1
Results and Discussion
Characterization of Sensors
Sensors 1 and 12 were synthesized as shown in Scheme 2. All the synthesized
compounds were fully
characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy
and HRMS spectrometry (Figures S3–S24). The structure of sensor 1 was clearly determined
using X-ray crystallography. The ORTEP view of sensor 1 is shown in Figure 1. The iridium(III) center is coordinated to two
nitrogen atoms and two carbon donor atoms from two 6-phenylpyridin-3-yl
acrylate ligands and two oxygen atoms from the acetylacetonato ligand,
forming a distorted octahedral coordination geometry. As expected,
the iridium(III) complex 1 shows a trans-N,N configuration. Crystal data
and details of structure refinement for sensor 1 are
listed in Table S1.

Dichloromethane, TEA = Trimethylamine)
PL Properties of Sensors
To investigate the Cys-sensing
property of the sensors, we examined the PL of 1 and 12 after titration with Cys in a mixed solvent (CH3CN/H2O, 1:1 v/v, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) (Figure 2, Figure S1). Sensor 1 containing two acrylate groups in
the pyridine rings of the main ligands showed a weak yellow emission
at 540 nm, which was ∼20 nm red-shifted compared to (ppy)2Ir(acac). This was because the electron-withdrawing acrylate
group stabilized its LUMO level, and thus, the acrylate carbon–carbon
double bond could act as an electron acceptor from the Ir complex
to decrease the phosphorescence intensity through donor-excited PET.14 The reaction of 1 with Cys increased
immediately the emission intensity at 540 nm because the acrylate
carbon–carbon double bond became saturated by conjugate addition,
resulting in the recovery of phosphorescence (Figure 2a). Phosphorescence emission then decreased
and shifted to the green region with the maximum wavelength at 516
nm over a period of 1 h, which was attributed to the conversion of
acrylate moieties to OH groups by the removal of lactam formed by
conjugate-addition/cyclization (Figure 2b). In the case of the reaction with Hcy, the emission
intensity increased at 540 nm over a period of 1 h, then decreased,
and shifted to 516 nm over a period of 9 h (Figure S2), which means that sensor 1 can effectively
discriminate between Cys and Hcy within 1 h. Sensor 12, having two acrylate groups in the phenyl rings of the main ligands,
exhibited different behaviors in response to Cys, as compared to sensor 1 (Figure S1). The green emission
of sensor 12 with the maximum wavelength at 504 nm increased
without chromic shifts even after 16 h of reaction with Cys. The maximum
wavelength and spectral shape did not change when compared to those
of sensor 12. However, the maximum wavelength of sensor 12 was different from that of compound 11 with
phenolic OH. This suggested that Cys reacted more slowly with sensor 12 than with sensor 1. This was supported by
MALDI-TOF MS analysis (Figure S3), indicating
that Cys was added to only one of the two acrylate groups of sensor 12.

Figure 2 (a) Time-dependent phosphorescence spectra of 1 (10
μM) in the presence of 100 equiv of Cys. (b) Time-dependent
phosphorescence intensity changes of 1 (10 μM)

of the PL intensity of 1 upon the addition of varying
concentrations of Cys. Conditions: CH3CN/ H2O (1:1, v/v, pH 7.4, 10 mM HEPES, 25 °C) (λex = 400 nm, bandwidth: 5/5 nm).

The PL intensity of sensor 1 (10 μM) showed
almost no change in the presence of other amino acids (Hcy, GSH, leucine,
arginine, valine, methionine, threonine, isoleucine, and lysine, each
1 mM) (Figure 3a).
Hcy and GSH also increased the PL intensity at 540 nm. However, unlike
Cys, Hcy and GSH did not show ratiometic PL changes within 1 h (Figure 3a). These results
supported the fact that sensor 1 was highly selective
toward Cys (Figure 3b). In the presence of other amino acids, additional treatment of
sensor 1 with 1 mM Cys shifted the maximum wavelength
to 516 nm, indicating that other amino acids did not interfere with
the reaction between sensor 1 and Cys (Figure 3c).

various amino acids. Conditions: CH3CN/ H2O
(1:1, v/v, pH 7.4, 10 mM HEPES, 25 °C) (λex =
400 nm, bandwidth: 5/5 nm).

ECL Properties
Figure 4a shows the ECL response of sensor 1 in
CH3CN/H2O (1:1, v/v, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 100
mM TPrA, and 0.1 M TBAP as the supporting electrolyte) upon the addition
of Cys. Unlike the PL results, the ECL intensity of sensor 1 drastically decreased until the addition of 100 equiv of Cys. Sensor 1 showed almost no change in the presence of other amino acids
(Figure 5a).

Cys (1 mM) as the potential is swept at a working electrode (Pt disk,
diameter: 2 mm) over the range of 0–2.0 V vs Ag/Ag+ (scan rate: 0.1 V/s). (b) ECL titration curve of 1 (10
μM) upon addition of Cys. LOD = 0.23 μM. Conditions: CH3CN/H2O (1:1, v/v, pH 7.4, 10 mM HEPES, 100 mM TPrA,
and 0.1 M TBAP as the supporting electrolyte).

Figure 5 (a) Competitive ECL binding assays carried out with addition of
1 mM Cys to 10 μM 1 in the presence of 1 mM amino
acid. (b) Comparison of ECL intensities of 1 and 7. All the ECL measurements were performed after reaction
for 1 h. Conditions: CH3CN/H2O (1:1, v/v, pH
7.4, 10 mM HEPES, 100 mM TPrA, and 0.1 M TBAP as the supporting electrolyte).

However, the ECL intensity of
sensor 1 dramatically
decreased when adding 1 mM Cys to the solution of sensor 1 and other amino acids.

The addition of Hcy (1 mM) to sensor 1 (10 μM)
resulted in a ∼30% decrease in the ECL intensity compared to
sensor 1 because the reaction rate was lower than that
with Cys. Interestingly, the addition of 100 equiv of GSH caused a
2-fold increase in the ECL intensity compared to sensor 1. This phenomenon resulted from PET inhibition through the reduction
of acrylate carbon–carbon double bonds, caused by the Michael
addition of GSH thiol to acrylate. This hypothesis was confirmed by 7 having an acetate moiety instead of an acrylate moiety (Scheme 2), which showed a
17-fold increase in the ECL intensity compared to sensor 1 (Figure 5b). The
addition of 100 equiv of GSH resulted in only a 2-fold increase. This
was because only a small amount of bulky GSH participated in the Michael
addition reaction. This was further confirmed by competition experiments
in which the ECL intensity decreased upon addition of Cys to a mixture
of sensor 1 and Hcy or GSH (Figure 5a). This was also supported by MALDI-TOF
MS analysis (Figures S4–S7). Therefore,
sensor 1 detected Cys selectively and also enabled discrimination
between Cys and GSH using ECL analysis.

In order to demonstrate
the potential clinical application, ECL
experiments were carried out in diluted human serum (10% in 10 mM
HEPES buffer solution, deproteinized) and CH3CN (1:1, v/v,
100 mM TPrA, and 0.1 M TBAP as the supporting electrolyte). Figure 6a shows a similar
tendency to those in a CH3CN-buffered system (see Figure 4). The ECL intensity
of 1 gradually decreased with addition of Cys as expected.
To demonstrate the stability of 1 in human serum, chronoamperometry
(CA)38,39 coupled ECL experiments were conducted by
a 40 cycle continuous scan, and the initial ECL intensity remained
almost unchanged (Figure 6b), indicating that sensor 1 was stable. These
results suggest that sensor 1 could potentially be applied
to ECL clinical diagnosis.

serum (1:10, v/v, 10 mM HEPES, deproteinized) and CH3CN
(1:1, v/v, 100 mM TPrA, and 0.1 M TBAP as the supporting electrolyte).
CA parameters were selected as follows: initial E: 0 V, high E: 1.5 V, number of steps: 80 (40 cycles),
pulse width: 0.5 s, sample interval: 1 ms.

Sensing Mechanism
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations
revealed that the HOMO of sensor 1 was mainly distributed
on the phenyl ring and Ir(III) center and the LUMO was distributed
on the acrylate moiety, unlike the LUMO that is generally distributed
on the pyridine ring of the main ligand in Ir(ppy)2acac
(Figure 7b). DFT calculations
supported the observation that the fluorescence of sensor 1 was almost quenched by PET. It also suggested that sensor 1 was able to show a turn-on signal in response to Cys by
blocking PET. We also evaluated HOMO/LUMO energy levels using cyclic
voltammetry (CV) measurements (Figure 7a, Table S2). Both the HOMO
and LUMO levels of sensor 1 were elevated upon the reaction
with Cys. In coreactant ECL,40 the LUMO
energy level of sensor 1 after the reaction with Cys
rose above the energy level of the TPrA radical, which prevented electron
transfer from the HOMO of the TPrA radical to the LUMO of the 1-Cys adduct, resulting in quenching of the ECL intensity.
We also conducted MALDI-TOF MS analysis to confirm the products formed
upon addition of biothiols (Figures S4–S7), which suggested that Cys underwent conjugate addition to the acrylate
moiety of sensor 1 followed by cyclization to provide
compound 2. In the case of 1 + Cys (100
equiv), the reaction rate was so fast that it was not possible to
identify the reaction intermediate of 1 + Cys (Figure S4). However, the reaction with relatively
small amounts of Cys (0.3 and 30 equiv) revealed that Cys reacted
sequentially with two acrylate groups of sensor 1 (Figure S5). However, the reaction of sensor 1 with Hcy was slower than that with Cys, resulting in the
formation of compound 2 and other intermediates (Figure S6). Interestingly, GSH was added to only
one of the two acrylate groups of sensor 1 (Figure S7). This suggested that PET via electron
transfer to acrylate carbon–carbon double bonds was partially
blocked by the 1-GSH adduct. As a result, the addition
of sensor 1 to GSH resulted in only a 2-fold increase
in the ECL intensity. This result showed the possibility of detecting
GSH by an acrylate-containing sensor using the ECL method.

voltammograms of 1 and 1-Cys
adduct. (b) HOMO/LUMO distributions obtained by DFT calculations and

Conclusions
We developed cyclometalated iridium(III)-complex-based
chemodosimetric
sensors for the selective detection of Cys. Electron-withdrawing acrylate
was introduced to the pyridyl group (sensor 1) of the
main ligand to control the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of iridium(III)
complexes. Sensor 1 reacted with cysteine selectively
by intramolecular conjugate-addition/cyclization, resulting in phosphorescence
enhancement and ECL quenching in the blue-shifted region. Particularly,
the reaction of sensor 1 with cysteine drastically increased
the LUMO energy level of the reaction product (1-Cys
adduct), leading to ratiometric emission changes from yellow to green.
Additionally, the coreactant ECL system prevented electron transfer
from the HOMO of the TPrA radical to the LUMO of 1-Cys
adduct, thus showing a high turn-off ratio of the ECL intensity. The
addition of GSH led to a 2-fold increase in the ECL intensity because
PET was partially blocked. Sensor 1 was successfully
applied to detect Cys in human serum by the ECL method. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first case of a cyclometalated iridium(III)-complex-based
cysteine-selective PL and ECL dual-channel sensor. We expect that
the rational design of efficient PL and ECL dual-channel sensors will
be useful for diagnostic technology.

Experimental Section
Materials
and Instruments
All reagents were obtained
from Acros Organics (USA), Alfa Aesar (USA), Sigma-Aldrich (MO, USA),
and TCI (Tokyo, Japan). Unless otherwise noted, all commercial reagents
were used without purification. 1H and 13C NMR
spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance DPX-300 or Agilent 400-MR
DD2 Magnetic Resonance System. Absorption spectra were measured on
a Beckman Coulter DU 800 Series spectrophotometer. Fluorescence emission
spectra were measured on a JASCO FP-6500 spectrometer, with a bandwidth
of 5 nm for excitation and emission. High-resolution mass spectrometry
(HRMS) data were received from the National Center for Inter-University
Research Facilities (NCIRF). Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass measurements were performed using
a Microflex (Bruker Daltonics). The sensor solutions (1, 12) for all photophysical experiments were prepared
from 2 mM stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), diluted with
acetonitrile (CH3CN), and stored in a refrigerator for
use. Amino acids were dissolved in 10 mM HEPES (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic
acid, pH 7.4).

Electrochemical Analysis and Electrochemiluminescence
(ECL)
Measurements
Electrochemical studies were carried out using
a CH Instruments 650B electrochemical potentiostat. Cyclic voltammetry
(CV) and chronoamperometry (CA) were performed on individual solutions
to investigate electrochemical oxidative and reductive behaviors.
ECL intensity profiles were acquired using a low-voltage photomultiplier
tube module (H-6780 series, Hamamatsu Photonics K. K., Tokyo, Japan)
operated at 1.0 V. A 25 μL ECL cell was directly mounted on
the PMT module with a custom-made mounting support during experiments.
All electrochemical and ECL data were referenced to a Ag/Ag+ reference electrode. All potential values were calibrated against
the saturated calomel electrode (SCE) by measuring the oxidation potential
of 1 mM ferrocene (vs Ag/Ag+) as the standard (Eo(Fc+/Fc) = 0.424 V vs SCE). CV and
CA for ECL experiments were performed using a Pt disk electrode (2
mm diameter) between 0 and 2.0 V at a scan rate of 0.1 V/s. Solutions
used for ECL experiments contained a 10 μM sensor, 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium
perchlorate (TBAP, TCI) supporting electrolyte in CH3CN
(spectroscopy grade, Acros), and 100 mM tripropylamine (TPrA, Sigma-Aldrich,
MO, USA) coreactant.

The electrochemical and ECL solutions were
freshly prepared for each experiment, and the Pt working electrode
was polished with alumina (Buehler, IL, USA) on a felt pad and sonicated
in a 1:1 mixture of absolute ethanol and deionized water for 10 min.
Then the electrode was blown with high-purity N2 gas for
1 min. A single solution was used for each experiment and discarded
after data collection. ECL values were obtained by averaging the values
from at least three data sets with good reliability in CH3CN/H2O solution (1:1, v/v, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4).

Sample
Pretreatment
Human serum (from human male AB
plasma, USA origin, sterile-filtered, Aldrich) samples were centrifuged
at 12000 rpm for 15 min to get a supernatant and then diluted 10-fold
with HEPES buffer solution (10 mM, pH 7.4) before analysis.
