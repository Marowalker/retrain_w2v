Magnetic bead-based analyte capture
has emerged as a ubiquitous
method in cell isolation, enabling the highly specific capture of
target populations through simple magnetic manipulation. To date,
no “one-size fits all” magnetic bead has been widely
adopted leading to an overwhelming number of commercial beads. Ultimately,
the ideal bead is one that not only facilitates cell isolation but
also proves compatible with the widest range of downstream applications
and analytic endpoints. Despite the diverse offering of sizes, coatings,
and conjugation chemistries, few studies exist to benchmark the performance
characteristics of different commercially available beads; importantly,
these bead characteristics ultimately determine the ability of a bead
to integrate into the user’s assay. In this report, we evaluate
bead-based cell isolation considerations, approaches, and results
across a subset of commercially available magnetic beads (Dynabeads
FlowComps, Dynabeads CELLection, GE Healthcare Sera-Mag SpeedBeads
streptavidin-blocked magnetic particles, Dynabeads M-270s, Dynabeads
M-280s) to compare and contrast both capture-specific traits (i.e.,
purity, capture efficacy, and contaminant isolations) and endpoint
compatibility (i.e., protein localization, fluorescence imaging, and
nucleic acid extraction). We identify specific advantages and contexts
of use in which distinct bead products may facilitate experimental
goals and integrate into downstream applications.

Introduction
Cell isolation provides
a foundation for both clinical assays and
basic biological research. The isolation of a subset of cells from
a large, diverse population enables the enrichment of a specific population,
unmasking the isolated population for continued analyses. In clinical
assays—whether a tissue biopsy or blood draw—cell isolation
is a critical step as patient-derived samples yield a complex mixture
consisting of a broad spectrum of cell types, matrices, and biological
factors. Cell isolation is required to (1) access a target population
hidden within the sample and (2) assess specific (and often rare)
analytes contained within target cells (i.e., RNA, DNA, and protein).1,2 Without isolation, the noise introduced by contaminating populations
impairs detection of the target-specific markers needed to inform
clinical care. As assays continue to delve deeper into the interrogation
of specific target populations—such as circulating fetal cells,3,4 circulating tumor cells (CTCs),5,6 and stem cells7—cell isolation processes will become essential
and drive the development of commercial cell isolation products. Reflective
of the ubiquitous nature of cell isolation in biologic studies, the
current estimated market value (over 3.5 billion USD in 2016) is predicted
to reach over 7.8 billion USD by 2021.8

Traditional approaches to tackle cell isolation, which purifies
or extracts the intended population, have centered on filtration,
centrifugation, sedimentation, and adherence. Filtration enables cell
sorting based on size, largely performed by selecting or excluding
populations using mesh filters of a specific pore size.9,10 Centrifugation and sedimentation enables sorting based on cell density,
often aided by density gradients to subdivide subtle density differences
across populations.11,12 Adherence relies on differential
cellular interactions with specific substrates over a specified timeframe.13 Although all are relatively simple and easy
to scale, these methods are quickly limiting when cells lack significant,
differential cell size, density, or adhesion, requiring new approaches
to cell isolation.

Solvingthe limitations of density- and size-based
cell sorting
is an emerging and quickly growing field, magnetic bead cell isolation.
Magnetic bead isolation has found widespread use in biological assays
and applications14−16 utilizing small (nanometer- or micrometer-sized),
magnetically responsive beads to manipulate a biological target. A
wide variety of magnetic beads with a diverse offering of surface
chemistries are commercially available enabling easy manipulation
of proteins,17,18 nucleic acid,19−21 and whole cells,22−25 providing a powerful isolation tool.26 For cell isolation, magnetic beads can be combined with a diverse
offering of commercially available antibodies specific to cell surface
proteins to enable the targeting of nearly any cell population.

Although magnetic beads are widely developed with well-characterized
physical traits and magnetic properties,27,28 limited literature exists directly comparing multiple bead types
within the same biological context to benchmark performance (i.e.,
capture efficacy and nonspecific binding) and impact on common downstream
endpoints (e.g., fluorescent staining of proteins to quantify localization,
nucleic acid extraction, and cell culture) across bead types. Here,
we evaluate five common cell isolation magnetic beads (Table S1)—Dynabeads M-270 Epoxy, Dynabeads
M-280 Streptavidin, CELLection Biotin Binder, FlowComp Dynabeads,
and Sera-Mag SpeedBeads streptavidin-blocked magnetic particles—to
highlight the tradeoffs and considerations in integrating cell isolation
magnetic beads into biologic assays. These particular beads were selected
to provide a range of capabilities that may be attractive to users,
such as cell release—CELLection, FlowComp; biotin-based antibody
conjugation for flexibility in cell capture—M-280, CELLection,
FlowComp, Sera-Mag; batch conjugation of antibody to bead—M-270s;
and advertised low nonspecific binding—Sera-Mag, M-270s. On
the basis of these reported favorable cell capture attributes, these
commercially available magnetic beads were chosen for comparison.
Beads were characterized in the context of EpCAM-specific (epithelial
cell adhesion molecule) cell capture. EpCAM is a cell isolation and
identification marker for epithelial cells, including CTCs.29−33 CTCs are rare tumor cells, which are shed from a tumor lesion and
enter the bloodstream. If captured, CTCs have the potential to provide
insight into cancer and were thus selected as a representative rare
cell population. To characterize the capture of EpCAM-positive cells,
we evaluated the capture of cell lines with differential EpCAM expression,
the release of those cells following capture (for FlowComp, CELLection
magnetic beads), and the nonspecific capture of relevant background
populations. Furthermore, we assessed the impact of the beads in integrating
with standard downstream assays, including cell culture, fluorescent
immunohistochemistry, and nucleic acid extraction. By evaluating a
variety of magnetic bead types across a spectrum of molecular biologic
assays, we aim to highlight the strengths, weaknesses, tradeoffs,
and considerations when integrating beads into a cell isolation protocol.

Results
and Discussion
Basic Magnetic Bead Characterization: Antibody
Binding and Surface
Density
Cell capture exists as a balance between the frequency
of antibody–antigen interactions (which can be problematic
at low antibody densities) and steric hindrance (which emerges at
high antibody densities). To first visualize the antibody density
on beads, the bead-bound capture antibody was fluorescently labeled.
The fluorescence readout of the antibody density on the magnetic beads
was generated from antibody–density curves for each bead type
(Figure 1A). Each magnetic
bead demonstrated a saturation point, at which maximal binding was
observed. Upon saturation, the addition of more antibody resulted
in no further increase in the signal. In translating the generated
antibody density curves (FlowComp, M-280) to cell capture (Figure 1B), similar results
are observed with poor capture at low antibody densities (too few
antibody–cell interactions). Capture increased with increasing
antibody density, until upon surpassing the maximal binding capacity
densities identified in Figure 1A, a decrease in capture was observed between capture at ∼7
and 40 ng antibody per μg bead (FlowComp p =
0.027; M-270 p = 0.047, N = 3).
The subtle decrease was likely a result of steric hindrance due to
the high, saturated density of the antibody. Notably, at least in
the case of LNCaPs (high EpCAM expresser), too low of antibody density
was much more detrimental to capture than too high of antibody density.
Conceivably, the relationship between the antibody density and capture
is dependent on a number of factors including antibody, cell type,
antibody presentation, and the size of the magnetic bead and cell.
Thus, understanding the balance between these metrics remains important
for optimizing the capture of a target population.

Figure 1 Characterization of bead–antibody
binding. (A) Magnetic
bead fluorescence intensity curves generated by varying densities
of a fluorescently labeled anti-EpCAM antibody on beads. A 50% maximal
binding capacity for each bead type was then identified (Table S2). Dots represent the average of three
technical replicates consisting of 100 beads each (300 beads total);
error bars represent the standard deviation of the analyzed population.
(B) Impact of the bead’s antibody density on target capture.
The 50% maximal antibody binding density for M-280s and FlowComps
is denoted by their respective vertical dashed line. Points represent
the average of three technical replicates; error bars represent the
standard deviation; * denotes p < 0.05, which
in this case applies to both M-280 and FlowComp.

On the basis of both the fluorescence titration curve of
each antibody
and the impact of antibody density on cell capture, an antibody density
of fifty percent of maximal capacity was identified for each bead
type (Table S2). Because of the different
sizes of the beads used (Table S1) and
the potential differences in surface roughness (not evaluated), the
surface area of each bead type varies. Thus, rather than choosing
a set concentration of antibody per milligram of beads (which ignores
surface area discrepancies across bead types), the fifty percent maximal
capacity was determined for each bead (Figure 1A) and used in all capture experiments unless
otherwise noted. Similarly, the number of beads per milligram was
different across bead types. To determine the impact the quantity
of beads had on cell capture, bead quantity per sample was titrated
using two different EpCAM cell lines, a high-expressing EpCAM line
(LNCaPs) combined with either a medium or low EpCAM expresser (22Rv1s
or Du145s, respectively) (Figure S1). Across
the evaluated conditions, the maximal capture was reached with ∼100
μg of beads (e.g., upon the addition of beads, little-to-no
increase in capture was observed); thus for consistency, 100 μg
of beads was used per sample (Figure S2). In applying beads to cell isolation, the combination of antibody
density and the bead number can greatly impact results; thus in ideal
situations, the antibody density and bead number introduced per isolation
should be titrated for each application.

Cell Capture
Target
cell capture efficiency and purity
is one of the most important magnetic bead characteristics. To characterize
target capture across each bead type, a low, medium, and high EpCAM-expressing
cell line (Du145s, 22Rv1s, and LNCaPs, respectively) was tested (Figure 2A). Despite the use
of an identical antibody to capture with, the capture varied greatly
across magnetic bead types, especially in the low-expressing Du145s;
CELLection and FlowComp magnetic beads resulted in the lowest capture,
whereas M-270s notably captured the largest population of Du145s.
Although the identical antibody lot (and conjugated stock with the
exception of M-270 beads) was used across all capture experiments,
differences in the bead surface (e.g., roughness and curvature due
to size differences) or the functionality of the surface could impact
how the antibody orientates on the surface of the bead. Antibody orientation
would impact the antibody’s potential for successful epitope
binding, possibly explaining the variable capture observed. Similarly,
how (and where) the antibody is biotinylated could impact antibody–bead
performance, highlighting the need to optimize each component of the
process for each bead type and new application.

capture. (A) Capture of EpCAM-expressing
cell lines (Du145 = low, 22Rv1 = medium, LNCaP = high) by each bead
type. Beads are abbreviated as follows: SM = Sera-Mag, FC = FlowComp,
CELL = CELLection. (B) Nonspecific capture of PBMCs by each bead type
across varying PBMC inputs. (C) Direct vs indirect capture of Du145s
from a PBMC background. (D) Resultant purity of the captured target
cells from direct and indirect capture of Du145s. In all plots, the
bars represent the technical replicate average (n = 3) with error bars representing the standard deviation.

Although specific capture of the
target is critical, for many endpoints
(e.g., sequencing), high purity is also required as contaminating
populations bias and mask target cell signatures. To determine the
potential of contaminants to reduce purity for each magnetic bead
type, the nonspecific capture of each bead was estimated by incubating
the beads with a mixed background population (PBMCs) (Figure 2B). Sera-Mag and M-270 beads
had the lowest rate of nonspecific capture of PBMCs compared to the
almost 10-fold increase in nonspecific binding with M-280s and CELLection
beads. The balance between the specific capture (target cells) and
nonspecific capture (i.e., background cells) often determines the
endpoints available as these metrics will determine both yield and
purity, a consideration in identifying an assay-specific bead type.

Both capture efficacy and purity may also be impacted by the bead
isolation method used: direct or indirect. Direct cell capture is
the most common, wherein the prebound antibody–bead complex
is incubated with the cells. In contrast, indirect capture involves
incubating the antibody with the cells, followed by bead capture of
the antibody-labeled cells. Typically, indirect capture results in
higher capture efficacy yet also results in increased contaminants.
For indirect capture, the antibodies dispersed in the sample are free
to interact and may incidentally bind nonspecifically with contaminant
cells at higher frequencies than when attached to the bead in the
direct capture; the balance of captured target cells (increased target
yields higher purity) and contaminants (increased contaminants yields
lower purity) will ultimately determine the resultant impact of indirect
capture on purity for each bead type. Indirect versus direct capture
of low EpCAM-expressing cells (Du145s) from PBMCs was evaluated for
each bead type (except for M-270s, which are limited to direct capture)
(Figure 2C). Additionally,
the resultant purity is reported (Figure 2D). Interestingly, the capture of Du145s
was highly variable across bead types. Notably, if direct capture
was low (average ∼10% capture), switching to indirect capture
had no impact, as demonstrated by the CELLection and FlowComp magnetic
beads. With indirect capture, the antibody is first added to the cells
to bind (little-to-no variation across conditions); then beads are
added and the antibody–cell complex is bound to the beads.
On the basis of the physical surface (e.g., roughness), the positioning
of streptavidin on the surface of the bead, and the location of biotin(s)
on the antibody, the orientation of the bound antibody on the bead
can be impacted. Binding of the biotin (or modified biotin) antibody
to the streptavidin may result in an antibody orientation, which results
in decoupling of the antibody from the EpCAM, resulting in the release
of the cell; this may explain why some bead types saw little difference
between direct and indirect captures. In contrast, M-280s and Sera-Mag
magnetic beads improved capture efficacy when transitioning from direct
to indirect capture.

When evaluating the impact of direct and
indirect capture on purity
(Figure 2D), the results
were surprisingly mixed. Although M-280s gained in capture efficiency
using indirect capture (from ∼30 to ∼50%), the overall
purity did not change, because of the increased contaminants captured
in parallel. Sera-Mags, which also saw gains in capture efficiency
(from ∼30 to ∼85%) with indirect capture, saw an increase
in the captured contaminants, but overall exhibited an increase in
purity with indirect capture. In contrast, CELLection and FlowComp
saw little differences in capture efficiency and no notable changes
in purity. Although differences in the indirect and direct capture
are difficult to predict without experimentation and variable across
beads, the gains in the target capture efficacy for M-280 and Sera-Mag
beads highlight the potential benefit of evaluating these metrics
when evaluating bead types.

Magnetic Bead Release Characterization
To characterize
release, the release of fluorescently labeled EpCAM antibodies from
each bead type was first characterized, followed by cell release from
each bead type. For each of the bead types, release is accomplished
through different mechanisms. FlowComp beads accomplish release by
introducing d-biotin (B-1595 or B-20656, Thermo Fisher) or d-desthiobiotin (D-20657, Thermo Fisher). These molecules have
a higher affinity for (modified) streptavidin on the bead surface
and thus displace DSB-X biotin from streptavidin, thereby releasing
the antibody and the attached cell from the bead. In contrast, CELLection
beads utilize a DNA linker to connect the antibody to the bead; the
provided DNase I can cleave the DNA linker attaching the bead to the
antibody to release captured cells from the bead. To fluorescently
characterize the release, a fluorescent secondary system was used.
Beads with different densities of primary antibody (22.5, 0.5, and
0.025 ng antibody per μg PMP) were placed in the release buffer
for varying durations, the magnetic beads were then removed from the
release buffer, and the remaining fluorescence on the magnetic bead
was measured (Figure 3A,B). Using this system, a decrease in fluorescence intensity corresponds
to a release of antibody. Although CELLection (Figure 3A) demonstrated the most rapid release, both
chemistries demonstrated at least 50% release within 5 min. Notably,
FlowComp bead release seemed hindered at higher antibody densities,
resulting in incomplete release. The delayed release by FlowComp at
a high, maximal antibody density could be due to limited access of
the release buffer into the tightly packed antibody–bead complex.
CELLection may not suffer from this issue as, by using a DNA linker
between the bead and antibody, CELLection provides added space between
the antibody and bead allowing easier access of the DNase.

time intervals. (A,B) Dots represent the average of three technical
replicates with each technical replicate representing the average

deviation of the technical replicates. (C) Release of 22Rv1s from

release of the cells. Gray bars represent the population of cells
lost during the release process because of the inefficient release.
In each plot, bars represent an average of n = 3;
error bars represent the standard deviation.

Next, the release of captured cells across different time
points
was evaluated using 22Rv1s. Cells were captured on magnetic beads
and allowed to incubate in the release buffer for varying durations.
The released and bead-bound fractions were then used to determine
the release efficiency across time (Figure 3C) (Figure S3).
Within 5 min, the maximal release was obtained for each cell line.
These data are comparable to the fluorescence data (Figure 3A,B), where for medium and
low antibody densities, substantial release occurred by 1 min, then
diminishing gains were observed as time increased. In the context
of cells, however, the release was delayed—complete release
occurred at 5 min instead of 1 min. As cells are often bound to beads
via multiple antibody linkages, multiple linkages must be broken to
release the cell; this is likely slowing the process when compared
to the fluorescent antibody characterization.

The release characteristics
of the low, medium, and high EpCAM-positive
cell lines were then characterized. Using the FlowComp (blue bars)
and CELLection (yellow bars) beads, we evaluated the best-case capture
efficacy of each bead (Figure 3D). Next, cells were released for 20 min (Figure 3E). CELLection beads were the
most effective at releasing cells, releasing ∼78–88%.
The release from the FlowComp beads was considerably lower than the
CELLection beads; yet, both bead types resulted in some cell loss
during the release because of an unreleased fraction remaining bound
to the beads (Figure 3F). The lack of complete release and discrepancies between release
efficiencies of FlowComp and CELLection beads could be due to a number
of differences in the release approaches. Release is dependent on
ensuring that the bead binds the cell through the antibody as the
antibody is ultimately released from the bead. For instance, because
of the close proximity of cells and beads, cells may nonspecifically
interact with the surface of the bead. As a result, antibody-based
release methods become ineffective at the release of the beads as
the cells are no longer solely bound via the specific antibody interaction.
Additionally, CELLection use a spacer (DNA linker) between the cell
and bead. This spacer may both place some additional distance between
the target cell and bead (reducing direct bead interactions) as well
as enable easier access of the releasing agent (DNase) to its target
especially when a number of antibody–EpCAM interactions are
likely occurring in a small area (e.g., high-expressing cells, LNCaPs).
Although difficult to determine the mechanism(s) impairing release,
evaluating different approaches with a relevant target of interest
is important for optimal results.

Although magnetic beads enable
isolation of a target population,
bead removal may be required for optimal compatibility with downstream
techniques such as fluorescence microscopy. Releasable bead chemistries
enable downstream separation and removal of the magnetic beads following
capture, frequently by the dissociation of the antibody and bead.
Thus, although release can be advantageous for an assay (i.e., imaging),
the benefits may be counter-balanced by a decreased, resultant-captured
(and released) target population.

Impact of Magnetic Beads
on Imaging and Analysis
Once
a cell population of interest is captured, many downstream applications
involve fluorescent protein staining, either for verification and
identification of the population or for protein localization and expression.
In either application, the fluorescent signal from the magnetic beads
may ultimately limit the fluorescent stains or channels as well as
impact the ability to discern localization or expression. Thus, the
fluorescence of each bead type on glass was initially characterized
across five different fluorescent channels (Figure 4A), with the flowing excitation/emission
filters (center(range)): 390(22)/440(40), 485(25)/525(30), 560(32)/607(36),
648(20)/684(24), and 740(13)/809(81) (as highlighted in the methods)
(Figure S4). Each bead had some autofluorescence;
while the intensity varied between bead types and channels, each bead
peaked at an emission of (560 nm) (Figure 4A).

glass across five different filter sets with emission wavelengths
listed. Bars represent the average of 200 beads; error bars represent
the standard deviation of the analyzed events. (B) Example images
of single cells bound to each of the bead types (note: bead coverage
of the cell greatly varied cell-to-cell for each bead type from a
few beads to complete coverage), demonstrating variable staining patterns
as influenced by the presence of cell isolation magnetic beads. (C)

on Hoechst staining for a nucleus. (D) Identified cellular androgen
receptor signal. (F) Ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic androgen receptor
identified in LNCaPs captured with each bead type and compared to
bead-free cells. In the box plots, 50 cells were analyzed per condition;
the notch represents the 95% confidence interval of the median and
the circles are possible outliers. A statistically significant difference
with respect to the no-bead group is indicated (*).

To evaluate the potential impact of magnetic beads
on the evaluation
of both protein expression (staining intensity) and localization (based
on a nuclear and cytoplasmic staining), LNCaPs were captured with
each magnetic bead type, fixed, and stained with a nuclear stain (Hoechst)
as well as antibodies to pan-cytokeratin (Alexa790), EpCAM (PE), and
androgen receptor (AR) (Alexa488). The captured cells were then compared
to a bead-free population (Figure 4B). Beads were found to have a variable impact on the
identified nuclear area, which conceivably would impact the ability
to easily discern nuclear localization of proteins (Figure 4C). Total calculated cellular
AR resulted in statistical difference in every bead type compared
to bead-free cells, demonstrating the potential of magnetic beads
to modify detected signal per cell, an issue when attempting to identify
populations based on expression (or lack of) (Figure 4D). In all bead types evaluated, cellular
AR decreased, likely due to the beads attenuating fluorescent intensity. Alternatively,
if a protein was expressed at a very low level (or not at all), the
bead autofluorescence might lead to a false quantification of positive
signal. Using both the AR signal and localization based on the determined
nuclear area, the ratio of AR nuclear localization (nuclear AR to
total AR) was calculated (Figure 4E). Although the localization ratio across bead types
seemed less variable than the results for cellular AR signal, certain
beads better yielded expression and localization patterns as bead-free
cells (Sera-Mag and CELLection).

Magnetic beads impact the evaluation
of fluorescent staining for
protein expression and localization as well as identification of the
nuclear area. One additional variable, bead coverage of the cells,
is also likely to influence these results. All bead types appeared
to variably cover cells ranging from only a few beads per cell to
complete coverage within a single sample, highlighting cell-to-cell
heterogeneity. As the number of beads, which bind to a cell is difficult
to control and highly variable (as observed by the range of bead coverage
of the cells within each bead type used), we assessed the impact of
beads bound to cells using the entire population of the captured cells
(both highly and sparsely covered cells). Thus, assays relying on
endpoint protein localization or cell identification through fluorescent
staining should closely evaluate the impact of cell isolation beads,
as beads can significantly distort population appearances; distortion
likely impacted by the number of beads bound to a cell, a variable
difficult to control.

Postcapture Culture of Cell Lines
Following cell isolation,
many assays require the user to culture the cells rather than perform
a terminal endpoint assay such as intracellular staining. Thus, the
viability of cells captured via magnetic beads was evaluated. Anti-EpCAM
beads were incubated with ∼5000 22Rv1s or LNCaPs and isolated
resulting in a captured bead-bound population. A total of 50 μg
of magnetic beads were used for each bead type. Following isolation,
the cells and beads were transferred into a 96-well plate and cultured
for 3 days. After 3 days of culture, cells viability was assayed (Figure 5).

Figure 5 Cell viability following
capture and release. (A) The viability
of cells (LNCaP, 22Rv1) bound to nonreleaseable beads compared to
untouched cells (underwent no magnetic bead isolation) following a
3-day culture (abbreviations: SM = Sera-Mag). (B) The viability of
cells bound to (bound) and released from (released) releasable beads
(CELLection, FlowComp) following a 3-day culture. Bars represent the
average of three technical replicates; error bars represent the standard
deviation.

For the nonreleaseable beads,
results indicated that M-280 and
Sera-Mag beads have no statistical impact on cell viability compared
to cell only (no-bead) viability for both cell lines (Figure 5A). M-270 beads resulted in
a decrease in viability relative to the cell only control (p-value < 0.01 for both LNCaPs and 22Rv1s). For the releasable
CELLection and FlowComp beads, viability is shown for (1) a no-bead
cell only control (none), (2) cultured bead-bound cells (bound), and
(3) cells cultured postcapture and post release (released) (Figure 5B). Overall, the
viability across conditions—including released and bead-bound
cells—remained high in both LNCaPs and 22Rv1s. For LNCaP and
22Rv1 cells, no significant differences were seen, regardless of the
bead type used or the culture condition (i.e., bound or release).
Ultimately, viability is likely an artifact of the cell type, cell
density, and bead density; nevertheless, these high viability results
demonstrate both the promise and potential impact on postcapture culture.

Integration of Magnetic Bead-Based Cell Isolation with Standard
Nucleic Acid Extraction Methods
Downstream of cell isolation,
many endpoints involve nucleic acid isolation. To characterize the
potential impact of each cell isolation magnetic bead type on nucleic
acid isolation, both RNA and DNA were evaluated. Ultimately each nucleic
acid isolation protocol differs in buffers, nucleic acid binding mechanisms,
and the impact of the cell isolation beads; thus, to highlight the
variable impact of cell isolation beads, two extraction methods were
analyzed for completeness. For both RNA and DNA, a low cell number
sample (∼5000 cells) was evaluated using a spin column and
a bead-based technique.

For RNA, 50 μg of cell capture
magnetic beads were added to each cell sample prior to the addition
of any lysis buffer to ensure that the impact of cell isolation beads
on the entire RNA isolation process was evaluated. RNA was then isolated
with a magnetic bead-based method (Dynabeads mRNA DIRECT) as well
as a spin column (Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit). Following isolation, the
eluted RNA (and beads) underwent reverse transcription (RT) into cDNA;
the cDNA was quantified by real-time quantitative-PCR (qPCR) (no beads
were loaded into the reaction). When cell isolation magnetic beads
were integrated into a spin-column isolation, little loss in RNA was
detected compared to the cell-only control (Figure 6A); rather FlowComp magnetic beads resulted
in a statistically significant (p-value = 0.032)
increase in the detected mRNA (Figure 6A). Similarly, the bead-based mRNA extraction—the
Dynabeads mRNA DIRECT Kit—resulted in no statistical difference
in RNA quantified from the cell-only condition or, in the case of
CELLection and Sera-Mag (M-270s resulted in an average increase, but
was not significant), a significant increase in RNA was detected (Sera-Mag p-value = 0.043; CELLection p-value = 0.012)
(Figure 6B).

Similarly for DNA, 50 μg of cell isolation magnetic
beads
were added to the cells prior to DNA isolation. Both a magnetic bead-based
approach (DNA-binding silica bead) and a spin column approach (QIAamp
DNA Mini Kit) were used to evaluate the potential impact of cell isolation
beads. To quantify the isolated DNA, qPCR was performed for a housekeeping
gene (GAPDH). When DNA was isolated by spin columns, no statistical
differences were seen in detected DNA yields (Figure 6C). In comparison, when DNA was isolated
by silica beads (Figure 6D), the DNA yield (via GAPDH) was comparable to the control for M-280,
Sera-Mag, and CELLection beads. However, a decreased yield was observed
when either FlowComp or M-270s beads were present during the lysis
step (p-value of 0.049 and ≪0.01, respectively).
Notably, FlowComp beads resulted in some loss (approximately half
the DNA yield compared to control), but M-270s resulted in over a
90% decrease in the detected DNA, a very different result compared
to the spin column DNA isolations. In this finite test of five bead
types, M-270s and FlowComp beads were the only beads that resulted
in the loss of DNA, specifically when DNA was isolated using the bead-based
DNA isolation protocol.

Across isolation methods in both RNA
and DNA (i.e., spin columns
vs magnetic bead-based extraction), cell isolation magnetic beads
had variable impacts on nucleic acid extraction based on the nucleic
acid approach used. In bead-based DNA isolation, cell isolation magnetic
beads could significantly hinder yield, yet identical cell isolation
beads had no statistical impact on the spin column isolation. Furthermore,
bead types did not affect the capture of all nucleic acids alike;
a cell isolation bead that seemed to impact DNA yield did not necessarily
impact RNA yield (e.g., M-270). Overall, the variable impact of cell
isolation beads across nucleic acid extraction methods highlights
many of the potential nuances in integrating cell isolation beads
into complex cell isolation protocols.

Conclusion
Cell
isolation magnetic beads enable the rapid targeting of nearly
any cell population, paired with a nearly endless offering of commercial
antibodies. Yet, how the isolation magnetic beads perform and how
they integrate into downstream endpoints impact their utility to users.
Different cell isolation magnetic beads come with trade-offs in their
ability to facilitate and integrate into different endpoints of cell
isolation protocols. For baseline performance metrics, M-280s facilitated
strong target capture enabling the use of both direct and indirect
capture approaches. For purity, Sera-Mag and M-270s paired strong
capture with low nonspecific binding of a complex background PBMC
population. Although FlowComp and CELLection did not perform as well,
these beads enabled release, which may be required for different culture
applications as well as facilitate precise fluorescent immunohistochemistry
endpoints such as protein localization. All cell isolation beads demonstrated
compatibility with RNA and DNA extraction; yet results highlighted
the method and buffer dependency of these results. This article aims
to evaluate the beads in the presented context of EpCAM-specific cell
capture, highlighting the range of results obtainable depending on
the bead-type utilized. Although this paper attempted to ensure optimal
performance across bead types, the attempts to standardize traits
(e.g., fifty percent maximal binding capacity and bead number added)
could all strongly influence the resultant capture (and release).
Similarly, although buffers were standardized across isolations, the
buffers and additives [e.g., fetal bovine serum (FBS), bovine serum
albumin (BSA), and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)] could impact
performance. Thus, this paper serves the introduction of different
bead types and provides insight into downstream users. Ultimately,
further investigation is required to better understand the mechanisms
behind the observed variation and direct the design of improved magnetic
beads for cell applications.

Materials and Methods
Magnetic Beads, Antibody
Conjugation, and Binding
Capture
experiments used a goat polyclonal anti-EpCAM antibody (Clone AF960)
(AF960, R&D Systems) conjugated to the following magnetic beads:
Dynabeads M-270 Epoxy beads (14311D, Thermo Fisher), Dynabeads M-280
Streptavidin (11205D, Thermo Fisher), CELLection Biotin Binder Kit
(11533D, Thermo Fisher), FlowComp Dynabeads (11061D, Thermo Fisher),
and Sera-Mag SpeedBeads streptavidin-blocked magnetic particles (21152104011150,
GE Healthcare Life Sciences) (see Supporting Information for more detailed information). An overview of the magnetic beads
evaluated is provided in Table S1.

Antibody was batch-conjugated to M-270s, as per the manufacturer’s
instructions, using the Dynabeads Antibody Coupling Kit (14311D, Thermo
Fisher). Because of the batch conjugation of M-270s, unlike the alternative
magnetic bead types, an antibody to bead density could not be easily
titrated. Thus, M-270s were conjugated following the manufacturer’s
recommendation, at a density of 6 μg antibody per milligram
of beads. For all other beads, the antibody was first biotinylated
following the manufacturer’s instructions (DSB-X Biotin Protein
Labeling Kit D-20655, Thermo Fisher) to facilitate streptavidin–biotin
binding of the antibody to the beads. Magnetic beads were washed by
placing the beads on a magnetic tube rack (DynaMag Rack, Thermo Fisher),
removing the original buffer, and resuspending the beads in an identical
volume of buffer [0.1% BSA in Ca2+ and Mg2+-free
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 2 mM EDTA]; the beads were again
washed prior to use. Separately, the antibody was diluted into an
identical volume of buffer, which was combined with the washed beads
and tumbled for 30 min using a Labquake rotator (Thermo Fisher) (set
to approximately 6 rpm). Following binding, the fluid was removed,
and the beads were washed and resuspended in buffer for use.

EpCAM
Expression
To more robustly characterize EpCAM-based
cell capture, EpCAM expression was assessed for each cell line to
differentiate a high, medium, and low EpCAM expresser. Cells were
stained with an anti-EpCAM antibody conjugated to phycoerythrin (PE)
(Clone VU-1D9) (ab112068, Abcam) (1:100) and Hoechst 33342 (H3570,
Thermo Fisher) (20 μg/mL), both diluted in 1× PBS supplemented
with 2 mM EDTA and 0.1% BSA. Once stained, cells were washed, resuspended
in PBS, and imaged on glass. After imaging, the mean fluorescence
(expression) of each cell line was calculated and normalized to the
maximum EpCAM-expressing cell line (LNCaP) to more easily compare
the relative expression (Figure S1). On
the basis of these results, Du145 (low EpCAM), 22Rv1 (medium), and
LNCaPs (high) were used in all subsequent experiments. Each of the
three cell lines had a similar diameter ranging from ∼15–25
μm, with Du145s being slightly smaller, generally ∼15–20
μm. The cell lines screened for EpCAM expression were all prostate
cell lines; prostate cancer has been one cancer type for which EpCAM-based
capture has proven clinically relevant in capturing CTCs.34,35 Additionally, many of the cell lines evaluated have been used in
the characterization of CTC capture platforms;30,33 thus, these cells represent a relevant target, spanning a wide range
of EpCAM expression, in the context of EpCAM-based capture of prostate
cancer cells.

Cell Isolation and Release
All cell
isolations were
performed using EXTRACTMAN (EM) (22100000, Gilson), a platform based
on the sliding lid for immobilized droplet extraction technology.36 EM allowed the simultaneous isolation of up
to four samples. For direct isolation, 100 μg
of antibody-coated magnetic beads (as described above) was incubated
with cells (total volume of 475 μL) on a Labquake tumbler (Thermo
Fisher) rotating at ∼6 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. For indirect isolation, the anti-EpCAM antibody was first added
to the cell solution (475 μL) and tumbled for 30 min at 4 °C
(as specified above); 100 μg of magnetic beads were then added
and the solution tumbled for 10 min. After incubation, the entire
volume was loaded into the input well of an EM plate (22100008, Gilson).
Using EM, the cells were then captured on the EM consumable strip
(22100007, Gilson) as the built-in EM magnets were held over the middle
of the well for 30 s to enable the collection of the beads, and then
the EM handle was moved over a wash well (small wash well, 110 μL),
where the lower magnets automatically pulled the beads into the well.
Once dropped in the wash well, the EM collection strip was pulled
back from the well, the lower magnet was removed, and the cells were
mixed three times using a pipette (set to 70 μL). For experiments
characterizing nonspecific capture of PBMCs, two additional washes
(110 μL) were carried out to improve stringency in deciphering
between nonspecific binding (i.e., cells and beads) and basic carryover
(i.e., cells caught in residual fluid on the strip). Once mixed, the
bead-bound cells were recollected on the consumable strip by leaving
the EM handle positioned over the well for 15 s and then moving the
handle to the next well. The contents of all wells were then collected
and imaged to ensure accurate cell counts.

For experiments involving
release, a similar experimental design was followed, except that once
washed, the beads and bound cells were dropped into a release well
containing either FlowComp Release Buffer (FlowComp Flexi Kit 11061D,
Thermo Fisher) or CELLection release buffer (CELLection Biotin Binder
Kit 11533D, Thermo Fisher) prepared according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (release volume of 110 μL). Once dropped into the
well, cells and beads were mixed by a pipette (three mixes; pipette
set to 70 μL), allowed to incubate for 20 min, mixed again,
and collected. Any nonreleased population of cells was then collected
by a magnet and transferred using EM to the final well. All wells
were imaged to ensure accurate cell counts.

Fluorescent Staining
Fluorescence characterization
of the antibody–bead interaction and antibody–bead density
was performed with either antigoat Alexa488 (ab150129, Abcam) or antigoat
Alexa555 (ab150130, Abcam) secondary antibodies. In brief, following
the binding of the primary antibody to the beads, the diluted secondary
antibody (in buffer) was added to the beads for 30 min. The beads
were then washed and resuspended in PBS prior to imaging. This fluorescence
characterization was used to identify an optimal anti-EpCAM antibody
density for each bead type (with the exception of batch-conjugated
M-270s). Using the fluorescent secondary antibody, the fluorescent
signal on the bead (due to bound anti-EpCAM antibody on the bead surface)
was quantified across increasing amounts of primary antibody (Figure 1A). The resultant
intensity curve of fluorescence versus antibody density was then used
to identify the 50% maximal binding capacity for each bead type (Table S2). To standardize the antibody function
on the surface of the beads for all subsequent experiments unless
noted (given the differing surface areas and surface functionalities),
the identified 50% maximal antibody density was used.

To first
fluorescently characterize release, FlowComps (with bound primary
and fluorescent secondary antibodies) were resuspended in FlowComp
release buffer (110 μL). At set time points, the beads were
collected using the EM handle and removed from the release buffer.
The beads were then dropped in a wash buffer and were imaged. The
CELLection beads were similarly characterized (utilizing 110 μL
CELLection Biotin Binder Kit Release Buffer). The measured bead fluorescence
was corrected by subtracting the baseline autofluorescence of the
blank-bead incubation with the appropriate secondary antibody as in
the experimental conditions.

For all cell line-based capture
experiments, cells were prestained
with either Calcein, AM (C3100MP, Thermo Fisher) or CellTracker Red
CMTPX Dye (CTR, C34552, Thermo Fisher). CTR was utilized when the
background cells were present, which were concurrently stained with
Calcein, AM to enable identification of each cell type. For viability
experiments, a live–dead assay was performed on the cultured
populations with Calcein, AM and ethidium homodimer-1 (E1169, Thermo
Fisher) at a final concentration of 1 and 20 μg/mL, respectively.
Cells were allowed to incubate for 20 min and then imaged using a
10× objective.

To determine the impact of cell isolation
beads on fluorescent
immunohistochemistry, bead-captured LNCaPs were compared to an untouched
population. Bead-bound cells were captured and washed using EM to
ensure that bead-free cells were removed from the population. Once
isolated, the bead-bound cells and untouched population were incubated
in buffer containing anti-EpCAM antibody conjugated to PE (1:100)
and Hoechst 33342 (20 μg/mL) for 30 min. The cells were then
washed with buffer, fixed for 15 min in 4% paraformaldehyde (P6148,
Sigma), and washed again. Following permeabilization (PBS with 1%
Tween-20 and 0.05% saponin for 30 min), cells were resuspended in
buffer containing an antipan cytokeratin antibody [fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC)] (35 μg/mL) (ab11214, Abcam) and antiandrogen receptor
antibody (1:100) (5153S, cell signaling) (incubated at 4 °C overnight).
After washing the cells, goat antirabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (ab150073,
Abcam) was added at 10 μg/mL for 1 h in buffer. Samples were
washed in buffer and resuspended in PBS prior to imaging on glass.

Imaging and Image Analysis
Samples were imaged on a
Nikon Eclipse Ti at 10× magnification (0.33 μm/pixel) (Nikon,
USA). Acquisition was performed with one of the following channels
and filter sets: 390 × 440 (ex 390/22; em 440/40), 485 ×
525 ((ex 485/25; em 525.30), 560 × 607 (ex 560/32; em 607/36),
648 × 684 (ex 648/20; em 684/24), and 790 × 809 (ex 740/13;
em 809/81). For capture and viability experiments, images were analyzed
using the provided NIS-Elements AR Microscope Imaging Software.

The quantification of fluorescent intensity of beads and cells was
performed using custom scripts written in MATLAB version R2016B (Mathworks,
Natick, MA). All raw fluorescence images were corrected for the background
signal by subtracting the local median within a square-moving window
with dimension at least 5 times the diameter of the cell type or bead
of interest. Background-subtracted bead images were smoothed using
a Gaussian filter (σ = 0.66 μm), and masks of the beads
were generated by thresholding (Otsu method) off the autofluorescence
of the unstained 485 nm channel. The relative density of EpCAM was
quantified by calculating the mean intensity of the EpCAM channel
(560) within the masks and dividing this value by the mean autofluorescence
intensity.

For experiments investigating the relative EpCAM
expression of
cell lines, images were normalized to have zero local mean and unit
local variance to improve the robustness of segmentation. Masks of
the periphery of the cells were created by thresholding the normalized
image at 1, and the relative EpCAM expression was quantified as the
mean intensity within these masks.

For AR localization experiments
in LNCaPs, cell locations were
manually marked in the cytokeratin channel (FITC), and masks of the
cell were generated by thresholding (Otsu method) followed by morphological
reconstruction using the manual markers. Nuclear masks were generated
using the same method on the Hoechst channel, and cytoplasmic masks
were calculated by subtracting the nuclear region from the cell masks.
Relative nuclear and cytoplasmic expression of AR was quantified as
the mean signal in these channels within each respective mask, and
a nuclear localization metric was defined as the ratio of nuclear
to cytoplasmic expression.

Cell Culture
Cells were cultured
under sterile culture
conditions at 37 °C in 5% CO2. VCaPs (courtesy of
Dr. Scott Dehm, University of Minnesota) were cultured in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco)
and 1% penicillin–streptomycin (PS) (Gibco). All other lines—LNCaPs
(ATCC), Du145s (courtesy of Dr. Scott Dehm), 22Rv1s (courtesy of Dr.
Douglas McNeel, University of Wisconsin–Madison), PC3s (courtesy
of Dr. Scott Dehm), and PC3-MM2 (courtesy of Dr. C. Pettaway, MD Anderson
Cancer Centre, TX, USA) were cultured in RPMI1640 media (#11875–093,
Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 10% FBS and 1% PS. To maintain consistency
across experiments, cells were counted, plated at 0.3 × 106 cells per well in a 6-well plate, and cultured for 48 h prior
to use.

Blood Processing
PBMCs were isolated from whole blood
for use as background cells. The whole blood—collected from
healthy donors and treated with K3 EDTA (Biological Specialty Corporation)—was
received within 24 h of the blood draw and was processed. Briefly,
the whole blood was mixed 1:1 with 1× PBS, overlaid on 15 mL
of Ficoll Paque PLUS (17-1440-02, GE Healthcare), and centrifuged
following the manufacturer’s instructions. After centrifugation,
the buffy coat was removed and diluted in 20 mL wash buffer (1×
PBS supplemented with 0.5% BSA and 2 mM EDTA). Cells were then centrifuged
(200 rcf, 10 min), pelleted, and resuspended again in 20 mL wash buffer
and stored on ice until ready for use. Once ready for use, cells were
centrifuged and resuspended as needed.

Nucleic Acid Extraction
and Quantification
For RNA,
cell samples (including 50 μg of beads) underwent either a spin
column RNA extraction kit (AllPrep Spin Columns, Qiagen) or a magnetic
bead-based extraction (Dynabeads mRNA DIRECT 61011, Thermo Fisher).
For the spin column, the manufacturer’s protocol was followed,
eluting into 15 μL of the provided elution buffer. For the magnetic
bead-based RNA extraction, 200 μL of provided lysis/binding
buffer and 20 μL of oligo(dt) beads were added to the cells.
Using a magnetic rack (12321D, Thermo Fisher), RNA was isolated following
two 200 μL washes of Wash Buffer B (10 mM Tris–HCl (pH
7.5) (Sigma), 0.15 M LiCl (Sigma), 1 mM EDTA (Sigma)), followed by
elution in 15 μL of elution buffer, 10 mM Tris–HCl. The
eluted sample (including magnetic beads) was reverse-transcribed using
the high-capacity cDNA reverse transcriptase kit (4387406, Thermo
Fisher) on a Techne TC-412 Thermal Cycler (37 °C for 1 h; 85
°C for 5 min).

For DNA extraction (including 50 μg
of magnetic beads), a spin column (QIAamp DNA Mini Kit 51304, Qiagen)
and a silica magnetic bead-based approach were evaluated. For the
spin column, the manufacturer’s instructions were followed
until elution where a modified elution volume of 15 μL was used.
For the silica bead-based isolation approach, cells were lysed in
200 μL RLT Plus (1053393, Qiagen) with 5 μL of Magnesil
KF magnetic beads (MD1471, Promega). Following lysis, beads and extracted
DNA were washed with Wash Buffer B (above) and eluted in 15 μL
of nuclease-free water.

To quantify, DNA or cDNA was mixed with
a LightCycler 480 Probes
Master Mix (04535286001, Roche) and a Taqman assay for either GAPDH
(Hs02786624_g1, LifeTech) (DNA) or HPRT (Hs11501003267_m1, LifeTech)
(cDNA). The reaction underwent quantitative PCR on a LightCycler 480
(Roche) thermal cycler (preincubation of 95 °C for 5 min; 45
cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for
1 s). The cycle threshold was calculated by the LightCycler software
with the second derivative algorithm.

Statistics
AR
localization results were analyzed for
difference by one-way ANOVA. Posthoc multiple comparisons were performed
using a t-test with Bonferroni correction. Statistical
significance was defined as p ≤ 0.05/15 =
0.0033.
