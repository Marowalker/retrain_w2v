We
present a completely solid-phase synthetic strategy to create
three- and four-fold peptide-appended π-electron molecules,
where the multivalent oligopeptide presentation is dictated by the
symmetries of reactive handles placed on discotic π-conjugated
cores. Carboxylic acid and anhydride groups were viable amidation
and imidation partners, respectively, and oligomeric π-electron
discotic cores were prepared through Pd-catalyzed cross-couplings.
Due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the three or four peptide
axes, these π-peptide hybrids self-assemble into robust one-dimensional
nanostructures with high aspect ratios in aqueous solution. The preparation
of these systems via solid-phase methods will be detailed along with
their self-assembly properties, as revealed by steady-state spectroscopy
and transmission electron microscopy and electrical characterization
using field-effect transistor measurements.

Introduction
Disk-like two-dimensional
(2-D) π-electron structures continue
to be a subject of research focus, be it due to their established
intermolecular interactions that are required for the formation of
discotic liquid crystal phases with high carrier mobilities or their
inherent relation to the cutting-edge graphene family of organic electronic
materials. A classic example of the former would be the general family
of hexa-alkoxy triphenylenes (HATs, Figure 1 left),1 where
the enthalpic contributions of π-electron quadrupolar and dispersive
interactions coupled with well-established van der Waals interactions
among alkyl tails facilitate well-established discotic hexagonal mesophases.
Such ordered assemblies are attractive targets for materials design
in light of the exciting electronic conduction anticipated through
these de facto supramolecular polymers.

HAT, trialkoxy 1,3,5-benzene tricarboxamide
(RO-BTA), and carbonyl-centered and N-centered BTA (C-BTA and N-BTA,
respectively).

It therefore stands to
reason that new motifs with even greater
enthalpic affinities might lead to enhanced materials. For example,
compounds with a threefold axis of rotation that are capable of intermolecular
hydrogen bonding have been widely explored for their self-assembling
abilities.2,3 A seminal example of multivalent discotic
architectures capable of amide-driven self-assembly is the 1,3,5-benzene
tricarboxamide (BTA, Figure 1), which have been explored by several groups.2,4−11 Due to their liquid-crystalline properties and the availability
of three axes to participate in hydrogen bonding, BTAs and related
molecules are able to form highly stable supramolecular assemblies.
The substituents attached to the amide nitrogens can vary from simple
alkyl or glycol chains12−15 to π-conjugated chromophores16−19 to amino acids and oligopeptides.20−26 Typically, these types of systems are known to form cylindrical
shaped fibers arising from columnar stacking of the molecules, giving
the structures one-dimensional (1-D) directionality and the potential
for anisotropic properties which are attractive for organic electronic
applications,16−18 especially when enhanced degrees of stacking can
be enforced by crowded arenes (RO-BTA, Figure 1).27 Several studies
have illustrated the advantages of three axes for the formation of
chiral supramolecular assemblies, the enhancement of the thermodynamic
strength of the self-assembled structures, and the lowering of the
concentrations necessary to form organo- or hydrogels.4,11,28 Utilizing amino acid or oligopeptide
side chains as self-assembly scaffolds is also beneficial due to their
ability to create directional intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which
work to strengthen supramolecular assemblies. They also provide handles
to fine-tune self-assembly through altering the oligopeptide sequences.25

Our group previously utilized the self-assembly
properties of peptide
fragments as a means to assemble linearly π-conjugated semiconducting
oligomers. To create these molecules, we developed synthetic procedures
based on solid-phase double-couplings or “dimerizations”
between π-conjugated chromophores and the N-termini of peptide
fragments immobilized on a solid support, as illustrated in Figure 2a.29−31 These procedures
begin with the solid-phase synthesis of the peptide fragment, followed
by the incorporation of the π-conjugated unit onto the solid
phase through either a double amidation (with π-conjugated dicarboxylic
acids), double imidation (with dianhydrides), or a piecewise synthesis
via N-terminus “capping” with an aryl halide, followed
by palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling. All of these methods have proven
versatile in the production of novel peptides embedded with a variety
of π-conjugated cores. However, these methods thus far have
solely been utilized to create twofold or linear peptide−π
hybrids as opposed to multivalent 2-D systems, for example, discotic
cores with three- or four-fold peptide attachment. These architectures
can be accessed by expanding the previously developed solid-phase
“dimerizations” into solid-phase multicoupling procedures,
as depicted in Figure 2b,c. We preferred a solid-phase route to homogeneous solution reactions
to minimize solubility issues or mutual reactivity of particular amino
acid side chains when trying to couple a hydrophobic π-electron
core with deprotected (and likely water soluble) oligopeptides under
suitable carboxylic acid activation conditions. We envisioned that
multiple peptide sequences might further strengthen the intermolecular
π-electron interactions necessary for energy transport; however,
at the same time, they might frustrate the fibrillization that is
known to be associated with more linear peptide−π electron
conjugates. Due to the potential benefits of creating more densely
functionalized discotic cores in terms of possibly stronger electronic
coupling and minimal fibrillization, we sought to expand our previously
developed synthetic procedures to create these multivalent peptides
and study their electronic and self-assembly properties.

Results and Discussion
We explored the synthesis and self-assembly
capabilities of four
multivalent peptide oligomers embedded with three distinct discotic
π-conjugated subunits: benzotrithiophene (BTT), decacyclene
triimide, and meso-substituted porphyrin. The peptides were synthesized
via standard solid-phase peptide synthesis, and π-conjugated
subunits were introduced by employing three different solid-phase
couplings (Stille cross-coupling, imidation, and amidation) to form
the final multivalent architectures. Although analytically pure materials
were available in fairly low yields, the quantities available are
sufficient for future biomaterial investigations, and the electronic
functions available to these hybrid bioelectronic materials could
subsidize the material cost. The molecules thus formed would be expected
to follow the BTA assembly paradigm, leading to columnar nanostructures
through intermolecular hydrogen bonding between peptide scaffolds
resulting in extensive intermolecular π-electron overlap (e.g.
the generic depiction in Figure 3). In the case of appended peptides with ionizable
amino acid residues, changes in pH can lead to variations in protonation
that affect the overall net charge of the molecules and thus, their
propensities to self-associate. For example, basic pH fosters a molecular
state for a peptide with acidic residues (aspartic or glutamic acids)
due to carboxylic acid deprotonation, whereas acidic pH would favor
acid protonation and thus minimize the electrostatic repulsion and
allow the peptide-directed hydrogen bonding to occur. At the same
time, self-assembly is expected to bring the π-electron units
into closer electronic communication. The self-assembly processes
were followed using standard electronic spectroscopies and the nanostructural
outcomes were visualized with electron microscopy. The 2-D chromophores
appear to withstand both the acidic peptide cleavage conditions (TFA)
and the acidic envrionments necessary to trigger assembly (HCl).

multivalent π–peptide hybrids.

BTT-Containing Peptide Trimers
BTT analogues have previously
been investigated as donor molecules in molecular heterojunction solar
cells.32 From a synthetic perspective,
BTTs were attractive substrates because well-established thiophene
functionalization chemistry should provide discotic cores compatible
with solid-phase peptide ligation strategies. We synthesized a BTT
core bearing three stannyl substituents under the expectation that
it could be used to link peptides via on-resin Pd-catalyzed chemistry.30,31 To append three peptides to the BTT core, solid-supported peptides
consisting of the amino acid sequence VEVAG-NH2 were prepared
on a Wang resin and N-acylated with aryl bromides (either thiophene
or bithiophene), as previously described.30,31 This peptide sequence was chosen based on our past experience that
showed this to be a generally applicable “consensus sequence”
able to promote the self-assembly of several different types of peptide−π-electron
conjugates.29,33 Then, as shown in Scheme 1, stannylated BTT S4 was introduced onto the resin under Stille cross-coupling conditions,
facilitating a triple coupling between S4 and three peptide
fragments presented on a resin bead. Following cleavage from the resin,
the desired peptide trimers 1 (T-BTT) and 2 (BT-BTT) were obtained.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of BTT-Containing Peptide Trimers 1 and 2 via Solid-Phase Stille Cross-Coupling
The absorbance and photoluminescence
changes observed for 1 and 2 upon assembly
are somewhat dissimilar
to those previously seen for peptides embedded with linear oligothiophene
chromophores.29−31 Typically, the linear peptides exhibit a blue shift
of the UV–vis absorbance λmax (usually accompanied
by a weak, red-shifted shoulder) and significant quenching in the
photoluminescence upon assembly, which is consistent with an H-like
aggregation arrangement of the linear chromophores.34 However, due to the threefold nature of the BTT core, and
hence the different symmetries and intermolecular interactions of
the transition dipoles, the same perturbations in the optical spectra
of the multivalent peptides were not expected. The absorption and
photoluminescence spectra of 2 were red-shifted compared
to those of 1 (absorption at 410 vs 363 nm and photoluminescence
at 565 vs 520 nm) when unassembled at basic pH (Figure 4a,c, dotted lines), due to the increased
conjugation afforded by the bithiophene linkers. Upon assembly, the
absorption spectrum of 1 showed a slight (9 nm) blue
shift accompanied by an enhancement of emission intensity with respect
to the molar absorptivity of the assembled peptide (Figure 4a, solid lines). In contrast, 2 showed minimal absorption perturbations upon assembly, whereas
the emission was much more significantly quenched (Figure 4c, solid lines). The behavior
of 2 is roughly comparable to the properties reported
for bithiophene-substituted BTT that indicated an evolution of vibronic
features in the thin-film state that were slightly (15–20 nm,
with an absorption onset of ca. 500 nm) to the red of the solution
absorption.32 At acidic pH, the circular
dichroism (CD) spectra of 1 and 2 displayed
bisignate Cotton effects in the vicinity of the chromophore π–π*
transitions (Figure 4b,d), suggesting that the transition dipoles of the self-assembled
π-conjugated moieties interact within the chiral environment
created by the assembly of the peptide substituents. Interestingly,
even at a basic pH, where significant charge repulsion due to the
deprotonated carboxylic acid endgroups and side chains would be expected
to inhibit intermolecular assembly, Cotton effects were still evident,
suggesting that some assembly occurs even at high pH. Many other pH-driven
peptide assemblies, especially those with challenging hydrophobic π-electron
components, are known to exhibit finite degrees of association under
solution conditions that would be expected to favor molecular dissolution.35,36 Despite several attempts to achieve true molecularly dissolved solutions
(addition of hydrogen-bond-disrupting hexafluoroisopropanol, measurement
of serial dilutions, and even heating of the spectroscopic samples),
signatures consistent with preassociating molecules were apparent.
Dynamic light scattering also revealed the presence of assembled nanoparticulate
structures at basic pH. These observations attest to the strong propensities
these very hydrophobic 2-D π-electron platforms have for self-association
in aqueous environments (see Figures S18 and S19). Furthermore, despite the similar structure of the two peptide−π
hybrid molecules, the CD spectra depicted Cotton effects of opposite
handedness and different intensities. Assembly 1 induced
a fairly strong positive Cotton effect, suggesting an overall right-handed
or clockwise helicity in the supramolecular assemblies, whereas 2 induced a weaker negative Cotton effect, proposing some
bias toward left-handed or counterclockwise helicity.37−39 Inversions in global chirality are not unusual for peptide assemblies
and unfortunately are not readily predictable.40,41

(left), photoluminescence (right) (a, c), and CD
(b, d) spectra of unassembled (dotted lines, pH 8) and assembled (solid
lines, pH 6) 1 (a, b) and 2 (c, d). UV–vis
and photoluminescence spectra were each acquired at a concentration
of 1.5 μM. CD spectra were acquired at a concentration of 22
μM. Photoluminescence spectra of 1 were obtained
following excitation at 375 nm (pH 8) and 360 nm (pH 6). Photoluminescence
spectra of 2 were obtained following excitation at 410
nm.

The assemblies of 1 and 2 were also visualized
using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Samples were prepared
by assembling 1 mg/mL aqueous peptide solutions through diffusion
of HCl vapor within an acid chamber (i.e., the sample was placed within
a closed container containing a separate vial of concentrated HCl).
Interestingly, the two related compounds seem to organize into quite
different nanostructures. 1 assembles into long 1-D nanostructures,
which appear to be on the order of a few microns in length (Figure 5a). The thinnest
structures display widths of 5.0 ± 0.7 nm compared to the 3.7
nm width that would be the expected for a single columnar stack of
the molecules in their most extended conformations. Most structures
appear thicker, which is likely due to bundling interactions between
two or more filaments. Alternatively, 2 (Figure 5b) appears to organize into
relatively ill-defined aggregates, as opposed to well-defined 1-D
nanostructures, under the same conditions. These differences could
be due to variances in solubility due to the more extended and more
hydrophobic core of 2.

samples of (a) 1 and (b) 2.

Decacyclene Triimide-Containing Peptide Trimers
To
complement the amide-bond-forming strategy above, we also examined
anhydrides with a threefold axis of rotation. In particular, we were
intrigued by Wudl’s recent work to synthesize decacyclene triimide
(DTI) from the corresponding tris-anhydride (3).42 The DTI products are of interest for their self-assembling
propensities and their potential to serve as n-channel semiconductors.
Using the method previously developed in our lab for solid-phase coupling
of peptides to anhydrides,29 a Wang resin
prefunctionalized with a D(AD)4GG-NH2 sequence
was treated with 3, thus leading to the peptide trimer 4 after resin cleavage according to Scheme 2. The multiple aspartic acid residues were
required to enable solubilization and high-pressure liquid chromatography
(HPLC) purification of the otherwise very insoluble peptide–DTI
conjugates.

Scheme 2 Synthesis of Decacyclene Triimide-Containing Peptide
Trimer 4 via Solid-Phase Triple Imidation
The absorbance and photoluminescence changes
observed for 4 upon assembly are again dissimilar to
those seen for the
previously studied linear peptide “dimers” based on
diimide linkers.29 The λmax of peptide 4 displayed a decrease in the molar absorptivity
upon acidification; however, this decrease did not coincide with a
spectral shift (either bathochromic or hypsochromic), as shown in Figure 6a. The previous report
on the DTI photophysics indicated that the UV–vis spectral
properties become much more broadened in the solid state versus solution
but the primary λmax remains the same.42 Furthermore, acidification of the sample caused
a noticeable enhancement of the emission intensity, as opposed to
the significant quenching that was previously seen for related linear
constructs. The CD spectra of 4 did not show any meaningful
absorptions in the chromophore π–π* region upon
acidification (Figure 6b), although changes in the higher energy amide region were apparent.
This suggests that the resulting supramolecular assemblies do not
show any bias for right-handed or left-handed helicity.

Figure 6 UV–vis
(left), photoluminescence (right) (a), and CD (b)
spectra of unassembled (dotted lines, pH 8) and assembled (solid lines,
pH 4) 4. UV–vis and photoluminescence spectra
were acquired at a concentration of 0.6 μM. CD spectra were
acquired at a concentration of 26 μM. Photoluminescence spectra
were obtained following excitation at 430 nm (pH 8) and 422 nm (pH
4).

The solution measurements did
not show the obvious signs of the
intermolecular electronic interactions that would be expected from
the assembly of these types of multivalent molecules. Nevertheless,
we studied the material that forms from a different assembly pathway,
as a result of a combined pH-driven and evaporative assembly as the
aqueous media under the necessary high-vacuum conditions is volatilized.
TEM was employed to visualize the supramolecular assemblies of 4 and are shown in Figure 7. The 1-D nanostructures are very well defined and
appear to be several microns in length, while maintaining a thickness
of 5.1 ± 0.2 nm. The most extended conformation of 4 is expected to be approximately 4.2 nm in length, thus it is postulated
that the nanostructures are composed of single columnar stacks of
the molecules in this extended conformation, although more complex
assembly motifs have been observed after DTI self-assembly in organic
solvents.42

Porphyrin-Containing Peptide Tetramers
Porphyrins play
natural roles as ligands, catalysts, light harvesters, photoinduced
electron transfer donors, and photosensitizers that collectively find
use in photosynthesis (e.g., chlorophyll) and a variety of enzymatic
reactions. Synthetic porphyrins have likewise been utilized for a
multitude of applications from biomedical therapy to electronic materials.43−51 Peptides have also been conjugated to porphyrins as a means to increase
their cellular uptake for photodynamic therapy applications or for
organization into arrays for photovoltaic devices.47−51

To create porphyrin–peptide conjugates
that test the limitations of our previously developed solid-phase
chromophore–peptide couplings, we constructed a free-base porphyrin
core with fourfold peptide ligation. This was completed through a
solid-phase PyBOP-mediated amidation procedure modified from our prior
work,29 utilizing commercially available meso-tetra(4-carboxyphenyl)porphine (5) and Wang resin modified
with DADGG-NH2 oligopeptides (Scheme 3) providing peptide tetramer 6.

Scheme 3 Synthesis of Porphyrin-Containing Peptide Tetramer 6 via Solid-Phase Quadruple Amidation
As shown in Figure 8a, the UV–vis spectrum of 6 at pH 8 shows
the
Soret band at 415 nm as well as four Q-bands at 514, 553, 580, and
631 nm (dashed line). Upon acidification, the Soret band redshifts
to 437 nm, and only two Q-bands are apparent, one at 595 nm and one
at 649 nm (solid line). This loss of two Q-bands is indicative of
a doubly protonated “diacid” version of the porphyrin
core, due to increased symmetry upon protonation.52 Similar behavior is seen in the emission spectra of 6 at high and low pH (Figure 8b). The basic and acidic samples were excited at λmax of the Soret bands, resulting in emission peaks at 640
and 665 nm, respectively. To further investigate the assembly of 6, CD was employed. As shown in Figure 8c, no meaningful signal was seen in the spectra
of samples prepared at pH 8, whereas that at pH 4 showed a weak signal
near 450 nm, suggesting that chiral assembly occurs upon acidification,
despite the protonation of the porphyrin core.

Figure 8 UV–vis (a), photoluminescence
(b), and CD (c) spectra of 6 in water at pH 8 (dashed
lines) and pH 4 (solid lines).
UV–vis and photoluminescence spectra were acquired at a concentration
of 3.4 μM. CD spectra were acquired at a concentration of 33
μM. Photoluminescence spectra were obtained following excitation
at 415 nm (pH 8) and 437 nm (pH 4).

To visualize the supramolecular assemblies created from acidification
of solutions of 6, TEM was employed. The resulting images
are shown in Figure 9. Using acidification as the assembly trigger resulted in 1-D nanostructures
several microns in length, which undergo significant interstructure
interactions to form larger bundled assemblies. Single structures
range in thickness from 6.5 to 9 nm, whereas the expected width of
the most extended conformation of 6 is approximately
5.0 nm.

Electrical Properties
To evaluate
the electrical properties
of the semiconducting subunits embedded within the peptide backbones,
the nanostructures obtained from these materials were incorporated
as the active layers of field-effect transistors (FETs). A solution
of the peptide was dropcast onto a Si/SiO2 substrate, and
self-assembly was triggered by exposure to HCl vapor. We previously
showed that the 1-D supramolecular assemblies form readily on SiOx dielectric surfaces. After drying, gold electrodes
were evaporated onto the film through a TEM grid used as a mask. Figure 10 depicts the typical
output characteristics obtained from the transistors fabricated using
peptide 6, measured under ambient conditions. The hole
mobility in the nanostructures was found to be 7.2 × 10–5 cm2 V–1 s–1, obtained
by fitting the transfer curve (Figure 10b) data to the linear regime equation of
the transistor current. This establishes that holes can be transported
through the self-assembled nanostructure networks obtained from the
peptide–porphyrin conjugate molecule. Previous studies on thin-film
transistors fabricated using spray-coated films of 5,10,15,20-tetra-phenyl
porphyrin, measured under vacuum, have demonstrated that the field-effect
hole mobility in the core unit may be as high as 1.2 × 10–3 cm2 V–1 s–1.53 Single crystal based FETs fabricated
using alkylated version of this metal-free porphyrin have been shown
to exhibit hole mobilities of 1.8 × 10–3 cm2 V–1 s–1.54 The hole mobility obtained here, under ambient conditions,
in the peptide–porphyrin conjugate seems reasonable, as the
nonconducting peptide domain is expected to hinder the charge hopping
mechanism within porphyrin units among neighboring nanostructures.
Nevertheless, the measured mobilities within these nanomaterials suggest
that they may be able to serve as active layers for carrier transport
in future bioelectronics applications. The field-effect hole mobilities
in peptides 1 and 2 were found to be comparable
at 4.6 × 10–5 and 6.6 × 10–5 cm2 V–1 s–1, respectively
(Figure S16).

Figure 10 (a) Output characteristics
and (b) transfer characteristics of
the FET device fabricated from peptide 6.

In the case of peptide 4, however,
no significant
electron transport (or hole transport) could be measured under ambient
conditions or vacuum. This may be due to a combination of molecular
and macroscale impacts such as (i) the inherent electron deficiency
imparted by the three planar diimide units in direct conjugation with
the π-electron core inhibiting the hole-transport ability, (ii)
the relatively larger volume fraction of the nonconducting peptide
component in 4, as compared to the semiconducting unit,
required to obtain water solubility, which may hinder charge hopping
amongst adjacent nanostructures to a significantly greater degree,
as compared to that observed in the other peptides, and/or (iii) the
polycrystallinity of the dropcast film, as visualized from scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images (Figure S17), which inhibits the formation of a continuous network of the semiconducting
units across the channel in the transistor. Although we could not
record the hole mobility for peptide 4, it indicates
that there is some macro- or meso-scale structural requirement for
hole transport and it is not simply inherent to assembled peptide
nanomaterials.

Conclusions
Multivalent self-assembling
peptide−π hybrid materials
containing a variety of tri- and tetravalent discotic cores (BTT,
decacyclene triimide, and meso-substituted porphyrin) were investigated.
Following the preparation of the π-conjugated subunits (if necessary),
four multivalent peptide−π hybrid systems were synthesized
by modifying solid-phase amidation, imidation, and Stille cross-coupling
procedures previously developed in our lab, thus expanding these methodologies
for the production of complex multivalent architectures. Although
the synthesis yields are relatively low, we stress that our investigations
to date have been enacted exclusively on commercial synthesis supports
that are designed to minimize the occurrence of site–site peptide
reactivity. It is conceivable that the yields reported here could
be increased with resins presenting denser peptide loadings. These
types of π-electron modifications should allow the resulting
nanomaterials to serve as active materials for electrical device characterization
in line with our past observations. Indeed, the hole transport measurements
obtained from peptides 1, 2, and 6 suggest the presence of interactions among adjacent π-units
within the 1-D nanostructures, which allow for migration of charge
through the 1-D stacks.

Each multivalent peptide was capable
of self-assembling into 1-D
nanostructures; however, absorption, photoluminescence, and CD data
suggested that the assemblies differed on the local supramolecular
level. For instance, whereas the assembly of BTT-containing peptide 2 corresponded with a quenching of the BTT subunit’s
photoluminescence, that of related peptide 1 and DTI-containing
peptide 4 triggered enhancements in photoluminescence.
Furthermore, the CD spectra of 1 and 2 showed
Cotton effects upon aggregation of opposite sign, suggesting helical
chirality of the assemblies with opposite handedness, whereas that
of 4 showed no signal in the vicinity of the chromophore,
signifying either a lack of helicity or directional bias of the helicity.
The assembly characterization of porphyrin-containing peptide tetramer 6 was complicated by the protonation of the porphyrin core
upon acidification, and could perhaps be tailored via the addition
of metal ions within the porphyrin macrocycle. Our future work will
seek to obtain a better understanding of the internal structure adopted
within these assemblies from both an experimental (e.g., through diffraction
and scattering measurements) and a computational (molecular dynamics
simulations and electronic structure calculation based on these simulations)
perspective.

Visualization with TEM also showed differences
in the 1-D nanostructures
formed by each multivalent peptide−π hybrid. 1, 4, and 6 each formed high aspect ratio
1-D nanostructures, each with widths corresponding to the length of
the peptides in their most extended conformation, suggesting a 1-D
stacking of the molecules in the supramolecular structures, whereas 2 appeared to form more undefined aggregates under the same
conditions. Furthermore, the nanostructures differed in the amount
of interstructure interactions, with 6 experiencing extreme
bundling, 1 displaying minor structure intertwining,
and 2 showing a relative lack of interstructure bundling.
These differences may be due to the different multivalent architectures
(trimeric vs tetrameric), as well as the variances in the conjugated
cores’ structural rigidities.

Experimental Section
General
Considerations
Dimethylformamide (DMF), pyridine,
chloroform, and nitromethane were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and
dried over 4 Å molecular sieves. Toluene, tetrahydrofuran (THF),
and dichloromethane (DCM) were acquired from an Innovative Technology
Pure Solv solvent purification system. Solvents were degassed by sparging
with nitrogen for 30–90 min before use. Reactions were performed
under an inert N2 atmosphere and glassware was flame-dried
prior to use. Tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium was obtained from
Strem Chemicals. FeCl3 was purchased from Acros. N-Methylpyrrolidone (NMP), Wang resin substituted with the
first amino acid, and Fmoc-protected amino acids were obtained from
Advanced ChemTech. N,N,N′,N′-Tetramethyl-O-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)uranium hexafluorophosphate
(HBTU), 2,3-dibromothiophene, and (benzotriazol-1-yloxy)tripyrrolidinophosphonium
hexafluorophosphate (PyBOP) were purchased from Oakwood Products Inc.
All other reagents and starting materials were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
and were used as received. 3-(Tributylstannyl)thiophene (S4) was prepared using literature procedures.55

NMR Spectroscopy
1H NMR spectra were obtained
using a Bruker Avance 400 MHz FT-NMR spectrometer and processed with
Bruker Topspin 1.3. Chemical shifts were referenced to the residual
protio-solvent peak (7.26 ppm for CDCl3, 4.79 ppm for D2O). Peptide 1H NMR spectra were acquired using
a 1 s presaturation pulse to suppress water.

Electrospray Ionization
Mass Spectrometry (ESI-MS)
ESI samples were collected using
a Thermo Finnigan LCQ Deca Ion Trap
Mass Spectrometer in negative ion mode. Samples were prepared in a
1:1 methanol/water solution with 0.1% ammonium hydroxide.

UV–Vis
and Photoluminescence
UV–vis spectra
were obtained using a Varian Cary 50 Bio UV–vis spectrophotometer.
Photoluminescence spectra were obtained using a PTi Photon Technology
International fluorometer with an Ushio xenon short arc lamp. Spectroscopic
samples were prepared by diluting in Millipore water until achieving
an absorbance near 0.1. The pH was then adjusted by adding 10 μL
of either 1 M KOH (basic) or 1 M HCl (acidic).

CD
CD spectra
were obtained using an AVIV 420 spectropolarimeter.
Spectroscopic samples were prepared by diluting to the appropriate
concentration in Millipore water. The pH was then adjusted by adding
10 μL of either 1 M KOH (basic) or 1 M HCl (acidic).

Due
to uncertainties in determining the concentrations of “molecular”
samples, the quantification of the spectral intensities (UV–vis
absorption extinction coefficient, photoluminescence intensity, and
CD molar absorptivity) should be viewed as approximate.

Reverse-Phase
HPLC
HPLC purification was performed
on a Varian PrepStar SD-1 (preparative) instrument using Luna 5 μm
particle diameter C8 with TMS endcapping columns with silica solid
support. An ammonium formate aqueous buffer (pH 8) and acetonitrile
were used as the mobile phase.

TEM
Imaging was
performed on a Philips EM 420 transmission
electron microscope, equipped with an SIS Megaview III CCD digital
camera. Aqueous peptide solutions (1 mg/mL) were rendered acidic after
the diffusion of HCl vapor within an acid chamber (i.e., the sample
was placed within a closed container containing a separate vial of
concentrated HCl). The microscopy samples were prepared by pipetting
a drop of these acidic solutions onto 200 mesh Formvar coated copper
grids and incubating for 5 min at 25 °C. Excess solution was
wicked off by touching the side of the grid to filter paper. The sample
was then stained with a 2% uranyl acetate solution and excess moisture
was wicked off. The grid was allowed to dry in air before imaging.

Device Fabrication
A neutral 0.5 wt % solution of the
peptides was prepared by dissolving the peptides in MilliQ water.
Of this solution, 5 μL were dropcast onto a piranha cleaned
Si/SiO2 (300 nm) substrate. This was exposed to HCl vapor
in a closed chamber for 5 min. After drying in air, 50 nm thick gold
electrodes were thermally evaporated, at a rate of 0.4 Å/s, using
a 200 mesh TEM grid as a shadow mask. The electrical measurements
were made under ambient conditions using an Agilent 4155c semiconductor
parameter analyzer. The mobility was calculated by fitting the transfer
curve to the linear region of the FET equation  where Id is the
drain current, μ is the hole mobility, Ci is the gate insulator capacitance per unit area, W and L are the width and length of the
channel, respectively, Vd is the drain
voltage, Vg is the gate voltage, and Vth is the threshold voltage. The capacitance
value for the 300 nm SiO2 layer was 11.5 nF/cm2, and the electrodes had a width of 120 μm and a length of
12 μm.

SEM
SEM images of the films were
obtained using a FEI
Quanta 200 Environmental SEM. The samples were prepared so as to mimic
the sample preparation for FET measurements and were sputtered with
platinum before imaging.

VEVAG-T-BTT Peptide Trimer (1)
Wang resin-bound
VEVAG-NH2 peptide capped with thiophene bromide (0.3 mmol)
(synthesis detailed in ref (30)) was placed in a Schlenk flask and dried under vacuum.
Pd(PPh3)4 (0.017 g, 0.015 mmol, 5 mol %) was
added. S4 (0.113 g, 0.102 mmol) was dissolved in 7 mL
DMF, and the solution was added to the reaction vessel via a syringe.
The mixture was heated to 80 °C with constant nitrogen bubbling
through the solution to agitate the resin beads for 20 h. The mixture
was allowed to cool and the resin was transferred to a peptide chamber.
The resin was subjected to a wash cycle (3× NMP, 3× DMF,
2× i-PrOH, 2× H2O, 2× (THF, i-PrOH), 2× acetonitrile, 2× ether, 2× hexanes).
The resin was then treated with a mixture of 9.5 mL trifluoroacetic
acid, 250 μL tri(isopropyl)silane, 250 μL H2O, and 5 mL DCM for 3 h. The resulting solution was separated from
the resin and was concentrated to approximately 5 mL under reduced
pressure; 90 mL of ether was added, and the orange solid was isolated
via centrifugation. The solid was dissolved in approximately 5 mL
of water and 10 μL NH4OH and lyophilized. The product
was further purified by HPLC to give 1 (0.0071 mmol,
0.014 g, 7.1%) as a yellow powder. MS (ESI) m/z 1989.1
(M – H)− (calcd 1988.6), m/z 1016.2 (M – 4H + 2Na+)2– (calcd
1015.8), m/z 1005.3 (M – 3H + Na+)2– (calcd 1004.8), m/z 994.3
(M – 2H)2– (calcd 993.8), m/z 662.5 (M – 3H)3– (calcd 662.2).

VEVAG-BT-BTT
Peptide Trimer (2)
Wang resin-bound
VEVAG-NH2 peptide capped with bithiophene bromide (0.3
mmol) (synthesis detailed in ref (30)) was placed in a Schlenk flask and dried under
vacuum. Pd(PPh3)4 (0.017 g, 0.015 mmol, 5 mol
%) was added. S4 (0.113 g, 0.102 mmol) was dissolved
in 7 mL DMF, and the solution was added to the reaction vessel via
a syringe. The mixture was heated to 80 °C with constant nitrogen
bubbling through the solution to agitate the resin beads for 20 h.
The mixture was allowed to cool, and the resin was transferred to
a peptide chamber. The resin was subjected to a wash cycle (3×
NMP, 3× DMF, 2× i-PrOH, 2× H2O, 2× (THF, i-PrOH), 2× acetonitrile,
2× ether, 2× hexanes). The resin was then treated with a
mixture of 9.5 mL trifluoroacetic acid, 250 μL tri(isopropyl)silane,
250 μL H2O, and 5 mL DCM for 3 h. The resulting solution
was separated from the resin and was concentrated to approximately
5 mL under reduced pressure; 90 mL of ether was added, and the orange
solid was isolated via centrifugation. The solid was dissolved in
approximately 5 mL of water and 10 μL NH4OH and lyophilized.
The product was further purified by HPLC to give 2 (0.0032
mmol, 0.0071 g, 3.2%) as an orange powder. MS (ESI) m/z 1117.2 (M – 2H)2– (calcd 1117.3), m/z 744.2 (M – 3H)3– (calcd 744.5).

DADADADADGG-DTI Peptide Trimer (4)
Using
an imide bond-forming on-resin dimerization protocol,29 Wang resin-bound DADADADADGG-NH2 peptide (0.5
mmol) (synthesized by standard SPPS) was placed in a Schlenk flask
and dried under vacuum. Decacyclene trianhydride (3)42 (0.110 g, 0.167 mmol) and pyridine (8 mL) were
added. The mixture was heated to 65 °C. DIPEA (1.3 mL, 7.5 mmol)
was added. The mixture was heated to 135 °C for 18 h with N2 bubbling constantly to agitate the resin. The reaction was
allowed to cool and the resin was transferred to a peptide chamber.
The resin was subjected to a wash cycle (3× NMP, 3× DMF,
2× i-PrOH, 2× H2O, 2× (THF, i-PrOH), 2× acetonitrile, 2× ether, 2× hexanes).
The resin was then treated with a mixture of 9.5 mL trifluoroacetic
acid, 250 μL tri(isopropyl)silane, 250 μL H2O, and 5 mL DCM for 3 h. The resulting solution was separated from
the resin and was concentrated to approximately 5 mL under reduced
pressure; 90 mL of ether was added, and the orange solid was isolated
via centrifugation. The solid was dissolved in approximately 5 mL
of water
and 10 μL NH4OH and lyophilized to give the crude
product that was further purified by HPLC to give 4 (0.033
g, 0.009 mmol, 5.5%) as an orange powder. MS (ESI) m/z 1193.5 (M – 3H)3– (calcd
1192.7), m/z 894.5 (M – 4H)4– (calcd 894.3), m/z 715.4 (M – 5H)5– (calcd 715.2), m/z 595.8 (M – 6H)6– (calcd 595.8), m/z 446.8 (M –
8H)8– (calcd 446.6).

DADGG-Porphyrin–Peptide
Tetramer (6)
Using an imide bond-forming on-resin
dimerization protocol,29 a resin-bound
DADGG-NH2 peptide (0.5
mmol) within a peptide chamber was suspended in 5 mL of DCM. In a
separate vial, meso-tetra(4-carboxyphenyl)porphine
(5) (0.060 g, 0.075 mmol) and PyBOP (0.017 g, 0.33 mmol)
was dissolved in 10 mL NMP. DIPEA (0.78 mL, 4.5 mmol) was added to
the vial and the solution was agitated for 1 min. The solution was
then added to the peptide chamber and mixed for 15 h. The resin was
subjected to a washing cycle (3× NMP, 3× DMF, 2× i-PrOH, 2× water, 2× (2× THF, 2× i-PrOH), 2× acetonitrile, 2× ether, 2× hexanes).
The resin was again swelled in 5 mL of DCM and subjected to a second
round of coupling with meso-tetra(4-carboxyphenyl)porphine
(0.040 g, 0.05 mmol) and PyBOP (0.12 g, 0.22 mmol) dissolved in 10
mL NMP, which was mixed with DIPEA (0.52 mL, 3.0 mmol), agitated for
1 min and added to the peptide chamber. The chamber was agitated for
24 h. The resin was again subjected to the same wash cycle. The resin
was treated with 9.5 mL of trifluoroacetic acid, 250 μL tri(isopropyl)silane,
and 250 μL water for 3 h. The peptide solution was filtered
from the resin beads, which were then washed 3× with DCM, and
the resulting solution was concentrated by evaporation under reduced
pressure. The crude peptide was then precipitated from solution with
90 mL of diethyl ether and isolated through centrifugation. The resulting
pellet was triturated with diethyl ether to yield the crude product,
which was dissolved in approximately 2 mL of water and 30 μL
ammonium hydroxide and lyophilized. The crude product was purified
via HPLC to give 6 (0.028 g, 0.011 mmol, 9.2%) as a purplish-brown
solid. MS (ESI) m/z 1224.9 (M –
2H)2– (calcd 1224.9), m/z 1236.6 (M – 3H + Na+)2– (calcd 1235.9), m/z 816.4 (M –
3H)3– (calcd 816.2), m/z 612.1 (M – 4H)4– (calcd 611.9).
