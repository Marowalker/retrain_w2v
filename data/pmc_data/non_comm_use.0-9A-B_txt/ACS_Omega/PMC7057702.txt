Alginate is a linear copolymer composed
of 1→4 linked β-d-mannuronic acid (M) and its
epimer α-l-guluronic
acid (G). The polysaccharide is first produced as homopolymeric mannuronan
and subsequently, at the polymer level, C-5 epimerases convert M residues
to G residues. The bacterium Azotobacter vinelandii encodes a family of seven secreted and calcium ion-dependent mannuronan
C-5 epimerases (AlgE1–AlgE7). These epimerases consist of two
types of structural modules: the A-modules, which contain the catalytic
site, and the R-modules, which influence activity through substrate
and calcium binding. In this study, we rationally designed new hybrid
mannuronan C-5 epimerases constituting the A-module from AlgE6 and
the R-module from AlgE4. This led to a better understanding of the
molecular mechanism determining differences in MG- and GG-block-forming
properties of the enzymes. A long loop with either tyrosine or phenylalanine
extruding from the β-helix of the enzyme proved essential in
defining the final alginate block structure, probably by affecting
substrate binding. Normal mode analysis of the A-module from AlgE6
supports the results.

==== Body
Introduction
Alginate is a major
polysaccharide constituent of brown algae1 and it is also synthesized by some bacteria of
the Azotobacter(2) and Pseudomonas genera.3,4 Annual worldwide production of alginate is around 45,000 metric
tons extracted from various types of brown seaweeds, with increasing
applications and demand.5 Its numerous
applications range from biomaterials in pharmaceutical utilization,
as food additives (stabilizing, thickening, or gelling agent) to the
use as technical materials in the textile printing industry.

Alginate is a linear copolymer of 1→4 linked β-d-mannuronic acid (M) and its epimer α-l-guluronic
acid (G) differing only at C-5. It has no regular repeating structure
but the residues occur in stretches of continuous M or G residues
and sequences of alternating M and G, referred to as M-blocks, G-blocks,
and MG-blocks, respectively.6 Alginate
hydrogels are formed by ionic cross-linking of G-blocks with some
contribution from the MG-blocks by certain divalent cations (e.g.,
Ca2+ and Ba2+).7,8 The relative
amounts of M and G and the length of the different block structures
therefore affect the gel-forming ability of alginates as well as other
physicochemical properties.9 Extraction
from different parts of the algae gives alginates with different properties.
The stem of Laminaria hyperborea contains
alginate with the highest levels of G (up to 70%) and is generally
the most valuable and widely used in food and industrial applications
because of excellent gelling properties.10−13 The leaf alginate has a lower
G-content (less than 55%) and fewer applications, and thus a lower
price in the market.

A unique feature for alginate is its synthesis
as homopolymeric
mannuronan, before G residues are introduced at the polymer level
by enzymatic epimerization at C-5. Eight mannuronan C-5 epimerases
have been identified in the alginate-producing bacterium Azotobacter vinelandii. One is a periplasmic epimerase
(AlgG),14 which incorporates single G residues
into the alginate during secretion of the polymer. Seven are extracellular
(AlgE1–7)15,16 and convert M to G in different
patterns. Additionally, one of the epimerases (AlgE7) displays alginate
lyase activity.17

The AlgE epimerases
all consist of two types of structural modules,
designated A and R.15,16 Earlier studies demonstrated
that only the A-modules are catalytically active,18 whereas the R-modules seem to modulate the catalytic rate
by calcium and substrate binding.18−20 The seven extracellular A. vinelandii enzymes have one or two A-modules that
can be classified as either MG-block formers or G-block formers.21 In addition, they consist of one to seven R-modules.
Although the different A- and R-modules have high sequence similarities,
the enzymes create quite different product patterns.16,18 The organism utilizes the differences in the enzymes to produce
alginate suited for its various needs during its complex lifecycle.
Similarly, the different C-5 epimerases can potentially be used to
tailor specific alginate structures for commercial applications.22 However, the mode of action of these elusive
enzymes and how it is related to their differences is still unclear.

AlgE6 (one A-module and three R-modules, AR1R2R3) and AlgE4 (one A-module and one R-module, AR) share
a high sequence homology15 but produce
alginate with different content and distribution of M and G residues.
Both enzymes probably perform the same epimerization reaction, processively
epimerizing every other M-residue into G-residues to form MG-blocks
around 20 monomers long.23−25 This is supported by the fact
that the residues in and around the active site are almost identical.
However, whereas AlgE4 introduces only MG-blocks into the alginate
chain, AlgE6 is able to epimerize MG-blocks and form G-blocks as well.26 As the main difference between the two enzymes
is in their modular arrangements, individual modules of both enzymes
have been studied extensively. The 3D structure of the A-module from
AlgE427 and individual R-modules from AlgE4
and AlgE628,29 have been determined by X-ray crystallography
and by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, respectively.
For the R-modules, the structural similarity is high, whereas their
affinity for alginate is significantly different. The AlgE4 R-module
shows interaction with dissociation constants in the μM range
for alginate oligomers, with a clear preference for M-oligomers over
MG-oligomers and no detected interaction with G-oligomers.20 In contrast, the AlgE6 R-modules do not display
any binding to alginate oligomers when expressed individually. However,
together (R1R2R3) they show weak
interactions with long M-oligomers with dissociation constants in
the mM range, but hardly any interaction with MG-oligomers.20

Tøndervik et al. 2013 have shown
that switching the R-modules
of AlgE4 and AlgE6 between mutant epimerases modulates the epimerization
pattern.21 In 2014, Buchinger et al. made
a hybrid enzyme AlgE64, consisting of AlgE6 A-module fused to the
AlgE4 R-module.20 This enzyme led to ∼25%
higher G-content compared to the native AlgE6 epimerase and it was
hypothesized that increased G-formation was directly associated with
the AlgE4 R-module’s stronger substrate interaction. The 3D
structure of a full-length alginate epimerase has not been determined
yet and the structure of the linker sequence connecting the A-modules
to the R-modules is unknown. However, both small-angle X-ray scattering
and NMR studies for the overall structure of AlgE4 suggest that the
linker region between the A- and the R-modules is flexible and does
not contain secondary structure elements.30

To understand why AlgE64 has increased G-block forming abilities,
we focused on the regions close to the transition between the A- and
R-modules. These regions are far away from the active site, but we
found that they affected the product patterns of the enzymes. To study
the molecular mechanisms underlying the MG- and G-block-forming properties
of the mannuronan C-5 epimerases, we created new AlgE64 enzymes. This
was done by rational design of the transition region based on the
primary and tertiary structures of AlgE6 and AlgE4. The product profiles
and mode of action of the new epimerases have been characterized with 1H NMR and time-resolved 13C NMR, respectively.

Materials
and Methods
Cloning, Expression, and Purification of the Hybrid Epimerases
The hybrid mannuronan C-5 epimerase genes were all synthesized
de novo (GenScript, Piscataway, USA). Genes coding for the hybrid
enzymes were inserted into pMV23 vector31 as NdeI-NotI fragments. Epimerases
used in this study are summarized in Table 1 and the gene sequences of AlgE64, AlgE64-A,
AlgE64-B, AlgE64-B1, AlgE64-B2, and AlgE64-B3 are included in the
Supporting Information.

Standard recombinant DNA procedures were performed
as described
previously.32 Plasmids were purified by
WizardPlus SV Minipreps DNA purification system (Promega). RbCl transformation
protocol (New England BioLabs) was adopted for transformations of
bacterial strains. Escherichia coli strain DH5α (Bethesda Research Laboratories) was used as a
general cloning host, whereas E. coli RV308 (ATCC31608)33 was used for protein
expression. Bacteria were grown at 37 °C in LB medium (yeast
extract, 5 g/L; tryptone, 10 g/L; and NaCl, 10 g/L) or in LB agar
(LB medium supplied with agar 20 g/L). For protein expression, strains
were grown in a 3× LB medium (yeast extract, 15 g/L; tryptone,
30 g/L; and NaCl, 10 g/L) at 30 °C to A600nm ≈ 0.8–1.2. The cell cultures were successively
incubated on ice for 5 min. Expression was induced by addition of m-toluate (final concentration 1 mM), and the cultures were
incubated at 16 °C for 16–20 h. Media were supplemented
with 200 μg/mL ampicillin when appropriate. The cells were harvested
by centrifugation and the pellets were resuspended in 40 mM MOPS,
pH 6.9, with 5 mM CaCl2 for sonication. After centrifugation,
the crude protein extracts (supernatant) were filtered (0.22 μm)
and loaded on a 5 mL HiTrap Q HP column (GE Healthcare). Fast protein
liquid chromatography (ÄKTA FPLC system—GE Healthcare)
was used for the purification and proteins were eluted using a stepwise
NaCl gradient (0 to 1 M) in the 40 mM MOPS, pH 6.9, with 5 mM CaCl2 buffer. The purity of the protein-containing fractions was
evaluated by SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were tested for epimerase
activity by NMR.

Production of Alginate Substrates
High-molecular-weight
mannuronan (poly-M) (FG = 0.00) was isolated
from an epimerase-negative strain of Pseudomonas fluorescens NCIMB 10525.3413C-1 labeled
mannuronan was produced by growing the mannuronan-producing P. fluorescens strain on a minimal medium with 99% d-13C-1 fructose as a carbon source. The obtained
mannuronan was selectively enriched to 59% with 13C at
carbon position C-1.35

Complete and
Time-Resolved NMR Analysis of Epimerized Alginate
Samples
Alginate epimerases can either epimerize an M-residue
next to another M-residue or an M-residue next to a G-residue. As
they are thought to epimerize every other residue in each processive
event because of the orientation of monomers in the polymer chain,
this will either create MG-blocks or G-blocks.20 In other words, their substrate specificities can explain
product patterns and they can only create G-blocks if they are able
to bind MG-blocks. As we can distinguish monomers based on their neighboring
residues with 1H NMR,36,37 we can characterize
the epimerization abilities of the enzymes extensively. Indirectly,
we are then able to characterize their substrate specificities. After
48 h, the reaction has reached completion and the enzymes have reached
their respective limits of how large a fraction of G-residues they
can create. This will hereafter be denoted “complete epimerization”.

Samples of 2.5 mg/mL poly-M were epimerized with 25 μg/mL
enzymes in 50 mM MOPS pH 6.9 with 75 mM NaCl and 4 mM CaCl2 buffer at 37 °C for 48 h. The epimerized samples were then
subjected to two-step acid hydrolysis prior to complete NMR analysis.
3-(Trimethylsilyl)-propionic-2,2,3,3-d4 acid sodium salt (Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI) in D2O (2%,
5 μL) was added as the internal standard for the chemical shift,
and triethylenetetra-amine hexa-acetate (Sigma-Aldrich) was added
as a calcium chelator (0.3 M, 20 μL). 1H NMR spectra
were recorded on Bruker AV III HD 600 or 800 MHz equipped with 5 mm
with cryogenic CP-TCI, Bruker AV III HD 400 MHz equipped with 5 mm
SmartProbe, Bruker Avance DPX 300 MHz equipped with 5 mm QNP (C/H)
probe, or Bruker Avance DPX 400 MHz equipped with 5 mm z-gradient DUL (C/H) probe). Analysis of complete epimerized samples
was recorded at 90 °C on the 300 or 400 MHz spectrometer, whereas
time-resolved NMR recording the epimerization reaction was performed
at 25 °C with 600 or 800 MHz spectrometer. For the time-resolved
NMR analysis of epimerization reactions, a stock solution of 22 mg/mL 13C-1-enriched poly-M (average DPn ≈ 70) in 5 mM MOPS,
pH 6.9, with 75 mM NaCl in 99.9% D2O was prepared. Purified
enzyme fractions from ion exchange chromatography were subject to
buffer exchange and concentrated (final concentration around 2.3 mg/mL)
by spin columns (VivaSpin, Sartorius Stedim Biotech) with molecular
cutoff of 10 kDa. Samples were washed with 5 mM MOPS, pH 6.9, with
75 mM NaCl and 27.5 mM CaCl2 in 99.9% D2O. Protein
concentrations were determined with a Nanodrop ND-1000 to ensure similar
enzyme concentration in the epimerization reaction. 13C-1-enriched
poly-M stock solution (500 μL) was preheated in the NMR instrument
and 1D proton and carbon spectra were recorded to ensure that the
sample had not undergone any degradation or contamination prior to
the time-resolved NMR experiment. Enzyme solution (50 μL) was
added to the preheated substrate and mixed by inverting the sample
two to three times. The sample was then immediately inserted into
the preheated NMR instrument and the experiment was started. The recorded
spectrum is a pseudo-2D-type experiment recording a 1D carbon NMR
spectrum every 10 min with a total of 128 time points. The recorded
1D carbon spectrum (using inverse gated proton decoupling) contains
8K data points and has a spectral width of 80 ppm, 32 scans with a
30° flip angle, and relaxation delay of 1.1 s (total recording
time of 60 s). The spectra were recorded using TopSpin 1.3, 2.1, 3.2
software (Bruker BioSpin) and processed and analyzed with TopSpin
3.0 software (Bruker BioSpin).

Normal Mode Analysis
The NMA was carried out using
the WEBnm@-server38,39 and the elNémo server.40,41 A homology model structure for the A-module of AlgE6 was created
with SWISS-MODEL42 using the crystal structure
of AlgE4’s A-module (PDB ID 2PYH) as a template. The WEBnm@-server implements
the elastic network model (ENM) with the C-α force field43 of Hinsen et al.44 The elNémo server employs the ENM model with the rotation
translation-block (RTB) approximation. ENMs are known to sometimes
exaggerate displacements, but still, the regions with the largest
motions within a model can be identified.39

Results and Discussion
Hybrid Epimerases with Conserved Folding
in the Transition between
the A- and R-Modules
We have previously shown that swapping
of the R-modules between AlgE6 and AlgE4 leads to changes in the epimerization
pattern of the resulting hybrid epimerases. AlgE64 (A-module from
AlgE6 and R-module from AlgE4) introduced a higher level of G-blocks
when epimerizing poly-M than AlgE6.20 This
is presumably because the AlgE4 R-module has a higher affinity for
poly-M and poly-MG than the AlgE6 R-module. Increased contact time
between enzyme and substrate could result in increased processivity
(more sugar residues epimerized per interaction). Given the high similarity
of the A- and R-modules of AlgE6 and AlgE4, we wanted to identify
which residues in the epimerases contribute to the different epimerization
patterns.

Based on AlgE64, two new hybrid epimerases were constructed:
AlgE64-A and AlgE64-B. In these enzymes, we aimed at preserving the
original folding of the transition region between the A- and the R-module
to a larger extent than what was done in AlgE64. AlgE64 contains amino
acid residues 1–386 from AlgE6 and the remaining residues from
AlgE4, and no concern was taken in preserving the fold of the transition.
As a crystal structure of a complete epimerase is lacking, the design
of AlgE64-A and AlgE64-B (Figure 1A) was based on evaluations of conserved sequences
and experimental27−29 and SWISS-MODEL42 homology
model structures of individual modules. In AlgE64-A, residues 1–409
are from the AlgE6 A-module and the initial part of the AlgE6 R-module,
whereas the remaining part of the R-module starting after the third
β-string of the β-roll belongs to AlgE4 (residues 410–531
in AlgE64-A). In AlgE64-B, residues 1–300 are from the core
part of the β-helix in the AlgE6 A-module, and the remainder
residues 301–534 are from AlgE4. Thus, the transition region
in AlgE64-A is based on AlgE6’s sequence and structure, whereas
in AlgE64-B it is based on AlgE4. This preserves well-defined structure
elements with conserved sequences and ensures correct folding of the
modules and the transition between them. The epimerization patterns
of AlgE64, AlgE64-A, AlgE64-B, and wild-type AlgE6 were tested on
poly-M at complete epimerization (Figure 1B and Table S1). The relative intensities of peaks corresponding to specific monads,
dyads, or triads give us fractions of G-blocks, M-residues, and MG-blocks
in the alginate (denoted FGG, FM, and FGM/MG).
We also get fractions of M-blocks and G-residues, FMM and FG (Table S1). As previously shown, AlgE64 is more effective at
forming G-blocks than AlgE6.20 AlgE64 also
displays better epimerization abilities than the two new hybrid epimerases
both in terms of the total number of G residues and G-block content.
AlgE64-A seems to conserve the nature of a G-block-forming epimerase
like AlgE6, whereas AlgE64-B displays an epimerization pattern resembling
an MG-block forming epimerase like AlgE4.

of the hybrid enzymes AlgE64, AlgE64-A, and
AlgE64-B, based on the crystal structure of AlgE4 A-module (PDB code 2PYG) and the NMR-structure
of AlgE4 R-module (PDB code 2AGM). Parts in green belong to AlgE6, whereas red parts
correspond to AlgE4. The location of the active site is indicated
with black circles. The structures are visualized with PyMOL.46 Sequence alignment of the transition region
between the A- and the R-modules in AlgE6 and AlgE4 is shown for each
hybrid enzyme at the bottom of their ribbon structure. Residues colored
in green (AlgE6) and red (AlgE4) denote the amino acids present in
the corresponding hybrid epimerases. (B) Product composition at complete
epimerization with AlgE6, and hybrid enzymes AlgE64, AlgE64-A, and
AlgE64-B, calculated from 1H NMR spectra. M residues are
shown in gray bars, GM/MG dyads in light blue bars, and GG-dyads in
dark blue bars. On the y-axis is the fraction of each monad and dyad,
whereas the four different enzymes are shown along the x-axis. These values are also shown in Table S1. (C) Time-resolved NMR spectra showing epimerization of 13C1-labeled poly-M for the four enzymes from B. The position of the
triads in the spectra is indicated, and the M or G moiety generating
the signal is underlined.

To study the mode of action of the enzymes, we performed time-resolved
NMR on epimerization of 13C1-labeled poly-M.35,45 With this method, the change in block composition in the substrate
over time was inferred from the characteristic peaks of monomer triads
(MMM, GGG, GMG, and MGM), that is, a decline in MMM and generation
of G-containing triads (Figure 1C). These results confirmed the same trends as the complete
epimerization. AlgE64-A produces G-blocks, shown as an increase in
the peak marked GGG in the figure. Both AlgE64
and AlgE64-A give a simultaneous rapid decay of the M-blocks, shown
as a decrease of the peak marked as MMM, as
well as a slow increase of MG-blocks (peaks marked GMG and MGM). The GGM
peak indicates the number of G-blocks and remains constant during
the reaction, suggesting an introduction of G residues as elongation
of pre-existing G-blocks (not apparent in Figure 1C but illustrated in Figure S1). AlgE64-B displays rapid incorporation of G residues
in MG-blocks, shown as a fast increase of MGM and GMG peaks, and only at later stages
a small amount of G residues is introduced as G-blocks.

From
complete and time-resolved epimerization results, it is clear
that the region differing in the two hybrid enzymes (defined by amino
acids 300–410 in AlgE6) is important for the epimerization
pattern. This is interesting, as it is located at least five to seven
subsites away from the catalytic site (defined as residues Y149, D152,
H154, E155, and D17827). We investigated
this further by creating mutants differing in this region.

Identification
of the Loop Protruding Out from the 10th Turn
in the β-Helix as Important for Determining the Epimerization
Pattern
Based on AlgE64-B, three new hybrid epimerases were
designed to identify which parts of the enzyme structure determine
the epimerization pattern. Altered parts are shown in Figure 2A. Each hybrid enzyme contains
a modified region where the amino acids in AlgE64-B originating from
AlgE4 are converted to the ones in AlgE6. In AlgE64-B1, the amino
acids from 305 to 322 were changed to correspond to the ones in AlgE6
(purple in Figure 2A and referring to AlgE6 numbering). In AlgE64-B2, the same was done
with amino acids from 323 to 352 (orange), and in AlgE64-B3 these
regions covered amino acids 353–375 (light blue).

model overview of AlgE64-B with localization of
three regions (indicated by purple (AlgE64-B1), orange (AlgE64-B2),
and, light blue (AlgE64-B3) colored parts) in the last part of the
A-module, which were mutated to create three new mutants. In the three
new mutants, amino acids belonging to AlgE4 are substituted to amino
acids present in AlgE6. Sequence alignment of AlgE6 and AlgE4 is shown
at the bottom of the structural model. Colored bold residues show
the three different modified parts, the same color scheme as in the
model. A sequence alignment of the long loop and how it differs between
these three mutants and AlgE64-B is shown in Figure S2B. The location of the active site is indicated with a black
circle. (B) Product composition at complete epimerization for AlgE6
and the four different AlgE64-B mutants, calculated from 1H NMR spectra. M residues are represented as gray bars, GM/MG dyads
as light blue bars, and GG-dyads as dark blue bars. The y-axis denotes the fraction of the three product types, whereas the
four different enzymes are listed on the x-axis.
These values are also shown in Table S1.

Data from NMR on poly-M epimerized
with the new hybrid enzymes
are shown in Figure 2B and Table S1. AlgE64-B2 and AlgE64-B3
have only minor differences in their epimerization patterns compared
to AlgE64-B. On the other hand, the modified loop in AlgE64-B1 appears
to have a considerable effect on the epimerization activity. AlgE64-B1
gave a higher FG fraction as well as increased
GG sequences along with a decrease of M-content and MM sequences.
Apparently, changes made in the loop are important for the G-block-forming
properties of the epimerases as the hybrid enzyme AlgE64-B1 displays
G-block formation similar to AlgE6.

Based on the results from
the modeling, the loop mutated in AlgE64-B1
appears to be long enough to embrace the substrate-binding cleft.
This is observed in other polysaccharide-active enzymes like alginate
lyases (described further down).47 Glycosyl
hydrolases also evolved long loops covering an open cleft, and this
tunnel-like topology of the binding site creates the conditions for
processivity.48−50 The tunnel allows the enzyme to remain firmly bound
to the polysaccharide chain while it slides through the active site
for several catalytic events.51,52 Cellobiohydrolase Cel6A
from Trichoderma reeseii contains the
active site located inside a tunnel-like cleft where a pair of loops
forms a “roof” on the substrate-binding cleft. One of
the loops undergoes conformational changes, which may be involved
in catalysis by triggering the enzymatic process or threading the
substrate through the active site. “Open and close”
conformations of the loop could allow the enzyme to bind the polysaccharide
throughout subsequent processive action.53 Likewise, we hypothesize that the long loop protruding out of the
β-helix core of the A-module forms a tunnel-like cleft, which
could embrace the alginate chain and affect catalysis. Indeed, mutations
in the abovementioned loop of AlgE2–AlgE4 hybrids have previously
been reported to influence the epimerization mechanism.54 However, these effects could be due to more
than modification of the loop, as the hybrid enzymes were created
by combining mutations in several regions.

Gatekeeper Residue for
Determining the Epimerization Pattern
of Alginate C-5 Epimerases
Tyrosine 307 (residue numbering
for AlgE6) in the loop is conserved in all G-block-forming enzymes,
whereas in MG-block-forming enzymes the same position is occupied
by a phenylalanine. This was shown in an alignment of 14 AlgE wild-type
and mutant A-module sequences.21 Tøndervik
et al. isolated two mutant epimerases, which were able to introduce
G-blocks more efficiently than the naturally occurring enzymes, and
both have a tyrosine at position 307 like the native G-block-forming
enzymes.

The point-mutant AlgE64-B-F307Y was therefore engineered
to gain a better understanding of the effect of this particular loop
residue in modulating the catalytic activity. AlgE64-B-F307Y only
differs from AlgE64-B in the single residue 307, containing a tyrosine
instead of a phenylalanine (Figure 3A). This mutant displays a significantly different
epimerization profile than the parent enzyme AlgE64-B after epimerizing
poly-M (Figure 3B and
C; Table S1). In fact, AlgE64-B-F307Y gives
similar values of monads and dyads to the ones obtained after complete
epimerization of poly-M by the hybrid enzyme AlgE64-B1. Both enzymes
are effective G-block formers, in contrast to AlgE64-B, which preferentially
forms MG-blocks. The residue at position 307 thus appears to be important
in determining the predominant epimerization pattern.

307 belongs to a loop in AlgE6 structure in proximity of the substrate
binding groove. The model structure was obtained using SWISS-MODEL
database.42 It is hypothesized that when
residue 307 is a phenylalanine, the epimerases form an alternating
(MG) block structure, whereas when it is a tyrosine they can form
both MG and GG-blocks. (B) Time-resolved NMR spectra showing epimerization
of 13C-labeled poly-M with AlgE64-B-F307Y, AlgE64-Y307A,
AlgE6-Y307F, and AlgE4-F307Y. The position of the triads in the spectra
is indicated, and the M or G moiety generating the signal is underlined.
(C) Product composition at complete epimerization for the four enzymes
from B and for AlgE4, AlgE6, AlgE64, and AlgE64-B, calculated from 1H NMR spectra. M residues are shown in gray bars, GM/MG dyads
in light blue bars, and GG-dyads in dark blue bars. The y-axis denotes
the fraction of each monad and dyad, whereas the seven different enzymes
are listed on the x-axis. These epimerization patterns
are also presented in Table S1.

To further confirm the role of the aromatic residue 307 in
native
epimerases, two additional mutants were generated. AlgE6-Y307F is
the point mutant of AlgE6 (G-block former) where tyrosine 307 is mutated
to phenylalanine, whereas AlgE4-F307Y is AlgE4 (a strict MG-block
former unable to epimerize an M neighboring a G) with substitution
of phenylalanine 307 to tyrosine. Figure 3B,C shows the results from poly-M epimerized
by AlgE6-Y307F and AlgE4-F307Y. The epimerization activity, and particularly
the G-block formation ability, of AlgE6 is considerably reduced when
residue 307 is mutated (Figure 3C). AlgE4-F307Y gained G-block formation ability, albeit only
to a minor extent (Figure 3C). Effects on the epimerization pattern are also found for
a mutant of AlgE64 when substituting tyrosine 307 to alanine. AlgE64-Y307A
showed a significant decrease of G-content and G-blocks of epimerized
poly-M (Figure 3B,C, Table S1). In a predominantly MG-block-forming
enzyme, an F307Y mutation increases the G-block-content, whereas a
Y307F mutation in a G-block former results in the opposite. In addition,
the large decrease in G-content created by AlgE64-Y307A compared to
AlgE64 supports the hypothesis that residue 307 is directly involved
in determining epimerization patterns.

Altogether, the data
presented here strongly suggest that the loop
and specifically the aromatic residue 307 play an important role in
substrate-binding and affects the epimerization pattern of the epimerases.
We speculate that the loop has a key role in G-block formation in
AlgE64 and all the mutants in this study. As the loop is about five
to six subsites away from the active site,21 we hypothesize an implication in substrate binding by enfolding
the substrate-binding groove and clamping the substrate. Phenylalanine
can only establish hydrophobic interactions with the alginate chain,
via the CH-face of the alginate monomers. We believe that the loop
in MG-block formers allows the alginate chain to be epimerized in
a processive way every second M residue, sliding smoothly through
the active site. For G-block-forming enzymes, we presume a tighter
interaction where the tyrosine sidechain establishes both hydrogen
bonds and hydrophobic interactions with the sugar rings. This strengthened
interaction between the epimerase and alginate could allow epimerization
of the initial product, poly-MG, creating G-blocks.

Flexible Loops
Promote Processivity in AlgE6
For this
hypothesis to hold, the loop in question needs to be able to move
quite flexibly. Recent findings on alginate lyases from the marine
bacterium Zobellia galactanivorans reveal
distinct topologies of the active sites involving several loops.47 In particular, the endolytic lyase AlyA1 presents
an open cleft with three loops that possibly move to form a tunnel
upon substrate binding. This results in “processive”
catalysis where the lyase slides along the alginate chain while depolymerizing
it. Apart from the loop harboring tyrosine 307, two other loops along
the substrate binding groove are also present in the AlgE6 structure
(see Figure 4A), similar
to AlyA1. In the following, these loops will be labeled as L1 (loop
1, residues 123–131), L2 (loop 2, residues 225–235),
and L3 (loop 3, residues 307–318 with tyrosine 307). To test
if these loops are flexible enough to clamp the substrate in the groove
in AlgE6, the flexibility of AlgE6 was investigated with normal mode
analysis (NMA).38,39,55

Figure 4 (A)
Loops present along the substrate binding groove of the A-module
of AlgE6. Loop 1 (L1, salmon) is defined by residues 123–131,
loop 2 (L2, green) by residues 225–235, and loop 3 (L3, blue)
by residues 307–318 (which includes tyrosine 307). The catalytic
residues tyrosine 149, aspartate 152, histidine 154, and aspartate
178 are shown in orange sticks and the loop residue tyrosine 307 is
shown in yellow sticks. Made with PyMOL. (B) Normalized square fluctuation
for the C-α atoms of the residues, using the model structure.
The fluctuations were obtained by the WEBnm@server as described in
the text. The regions corresponding to the catalytic site and the
investigated loops L1–L3 are highlighted in the figure. (C)
Computed B factors by the elNémo server and the original B
factors present in the model. The regions corresponding to the catalytic
site and the investigated loops L1–L3 are highlighted in the
figure.

In Figure 4B, we
show the normalized square fluctuation for each C-α atom calculated
using the 200 lowest (nontrivial) modes. The results in Figure 4B show that the largest fluctuations
in the model structure are associated with residues in the loops.
In particular, the residues in L1 and L3 demonstrate the potential
flexibility of these loops. The lowest frequency modes found by an
NMA indicate the most mobile parts and the direction of movements.56 Further visual inspection of the displacements
associated with the lowest frequency modes show that these motions
involve the movement of L3 (and L1) toward the substrate-binding groove,
see Figures S3–S5 and Movies S1–S4 (available on-line). This supports the idea that these loops may
be important for the binding of a substrate. The determined Debye–Waller
factors, or B-factors, indicate how flexible different parts of a
crystal structure are. The B-factors in the model do not indicate
large fluctuations associated with the loops. However, this may be
due to the crystallographic environment assumed in this case. To investigate
this point further, we have recalculated the B-factors with an additional
NMA and compare these B-factors to the B-factors assumed in the model
in Figure 4C. Again,
the NMA finds relatively large fluctuations associated with the loops.
L3 has the largest fluctuations, indicating that it is flexible.

These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the L3 loop
containing tyrosine 307 has an important role in the enzyme function.
A sequence alignment of the three loops in nine wild-type AlgE A-modules
and four mutants shows that the amino acids in the loops are either
highly conserved or bear low sequence identity. The only amino acid
consistently different between G-block formers and MG-block formers
is 307 (Figure S2). L1 and L2 could have
similar roles of substrate clamping, but it is also possible that
their flexibility promotes other, as yet unknown, functions.

Conclusions
As AlgE64 is an effective G-block forming epimerase, we made new
hybrid AlgE64-descending epimerases differing in the transition regions
between the A- and R-modules. The initial aim of explaining the improved
G-block forming ability gave us insight into the molecular mechanism
responsible for determining epimerization patterns. The last part
of the A-module has a strong impact on the epimerization pattern,
even though it is located far from the catalytic site. Loops protruding
from the β-helix core of the A-module were suggested to be responsible
for the variation in epimerization patterns, by forming a tunnel-like
cleft embracing the alginate substrate. More specifically, amino acid
307 in loop L3 influenced the epimerization activity and the product
profile. Finally, an NMA of the model A-module of AlgE6 supports the
notion that flexible loops could interact with the substrate and influence
the activity.
