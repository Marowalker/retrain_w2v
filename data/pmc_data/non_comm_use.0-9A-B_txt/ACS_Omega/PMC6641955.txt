Porous materials with molecular-scale
ordering have attracted major
attention mainly because of the possibility to engineer their pores
for selective applications. Periodic mesoporous organosilica is a
class of hybrid materials where self-assembly of the organic linkers
provides a crystal-like pore wall. However, unlike metal coordination,
specific geometries cannot be predicted because of the competitive
and dynamic nature of noncovalent interactions. Herein, we study the
influence of competing noncovalent interactions in the pore walls
on the biodegradation of organosilica frameworks for drug delivery
application. These results support the importance of studying self-assembly
patterns in hybrid frameworks to better engineer the next generation
of dynamic or “soft” porous materials.

1 Introduction
Controlling
periodicity in hybrid porous structures has bestowed
infinite practical utilities, especially in the fields of separation,
encapsulation, and catalysis.1−3 The crystalline features of molecularly
ordered hybrid structures, such as metal–organic frameworks
(MOFs), made these materials quite superior to their amorphous counterparts.4 Periodic mesoporous organosilica (PMOs) are a
class of inorganic–organic hybrid porous materials that have
crystal-like pore walls with structural periodicity. It is synthesized
by direct condensation of the bridged organosilane precursor (R′O)3Si–R–Si(OR′)3 where R is the
organic bridging group.5−8 Inagaki et al. reported the first periodic organosilica with lamellar
ordered pore walls employing a benzene organic bridge.9 Supramolecular structures formed by self-directed assembly
in trans or cis isomers of azobenzene has also been reported.10−13 More recently, hydrogen bonding in cyclohexane triamide caused a
new type of molecular-scale ordering within the pore wall, which improved
the guest loading efficiency in these hybrid structures.5 Engineering ordered porous structures employing
noncovalent interactions rather than metal coordination is quite intriguing,
as it can produce a new generation of hierarchical and dynamic porous
structures especially for biomedical applications.14

Many degradable PMOs have been designed that can
be triggered by
light,14 enzyme (GTH, trypsin),15,16 pH,17 and electrostatic interaction18 to controllably release the therapeutic cargo.
Moreover, loading guest organic molecules in the pores does not need
a capping agent because of the hydrophobic interaction between the
guest and organic pore wall.19 Enzymatic
triggers are highly thought after because of their selectivity and
site specificity.20,21 The azo-bond is an interesting
moiety to employ in a biodegradable drug delivery system, as it reductively
cleaves in the presence of azoreductase.22−25 Moreover, this bond could be
effectively cleaved by one-electron reduction which is applicable
only under hypoxia conditions.26−29 In addition, azoreductase was used as a trigger to
visualize specifically lysosomes in hypoxic cancer cells.30 Many drug delivery systems were reported using
this building block as a trigger such as MOFs,31 polymeric vesicles,32 and hydrogels.33

In this work, we study the influence of
ligands self-assembly on
the biodegradation of mesoporous organosilica nanoparticles (NPs)
for on-demand drug delivery. Azobenzene linkers (AZO) were condensed
with aromatic benzene (B) or aliphatic ethane (E), bridging groups
to prepare the hybrid frameworks AZO-B and AZO-E, respectively (Figure 1). Investigating
the ligand packing on both frameworks showed that AZO-B afforded a
framework with a compact pore wall compared with AZO-E. Interestingly,
AZO-B showed a faster biodegradation than AZO-E in vitro and in vivo.
We expect that other hybrid structures can be produced in a fashion
similar to tailor pore wall chemistry and enable the preparation of
soft hybrid frameworks with site-specific conjugation and degradation.

2 Results and Discussion
Polycondensation of
diazobenzene-triethoxysilyl amide (165 μL,
0.20 mmol) under basic conditions with benzene (400 μL, 1.0
mmol) or ethane-modified silanes (250 μL, 1.0 mmol) followed
by extraction with an alcoholic solution of ammonium nitrate (6 g
L–1) and drying overnight afforded NPs AZO-B and
AZO-E, respectively. Azobenzene may form multiple noncovalent interactions
depending on the neighboring molecules, and the dynamic nature of
the azo bond makes it more susceptible to degradation.34 Increasing the percentage of azobenzene beyond
15% afforded bulk samples at the microscale with a more complex pore
wall packing. The AZO linker 1 was prepared following Scheme S1 and fully characterized using 1H and 13C NMR (Figure S1). The TEM images of AZO-B and AZO-E reveal well-ordered arrangements
of mesoscopically ordered pores with a hexagonal symmetry (Figures S2a,b and S3a,b, respectively). The chemical
composition of AZO-B and AZO-E NPs was confirmed by scanning TEM (STEM)
combined with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and energy
dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) (Figures S2h,i and S3h,i, respectively). The STEM–EELS validated the
homogeneous distribution of the azo precursor within AZO-B and AZO-E
frameworks by the elemental mappings of silicon, oxygen, nitrogen,
and carbon (Figures S2c–g and S3c–g, respectively). EDX spectroscopy also confirmed the presence of
silicon, oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen elements (Figures S2i and S3i). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
(FT-IR) verified the successful incorporation of AZO in the framework
of AZO-B where the characteristic peaks of silica [νSi–O (1090–1125 cm–1)]35 and the νC–H and νSi–C stretching vibration modes of the benzene group at 3070 and 1162
cm–1 were observed (Figure S4).36 The vibrational spectra of azobenzene
were detected in the 1650–900 cm–1 region,37 and the out-of-plane aromatic δCsp2–H bending was detected at 534 cm–1 (Figure S4). Similarly, FT-IR of AZO-E
showed the ethane modes νSi–C and aliphatic
νC–H at 1162 and 2908 cm–1 and the δCsp2–H at 918 cm–1,38 along with the stretching
mode of νSi–O from 1090 to 1125 cm–1 (Figure S4).38 Solid-state 13C and 29Si magic angle spinning
(MAS) NMR measurements of AZO-B showed a successful incorporation
of organic moieties into the mesostructured NPs with a degree of condensation
of ca. 70% (Figure 2a). The NMR spectrum of AZO-B shows the peaks at −59, −68,
and −77 ppm, corresponding to T1(CSi(OSi)(OH)2), T2(CSi(OSi)2(OH)), and T3(CSi(OSi)3), respectively, in addition to a small peak
at −108 ppm attributable to Q4(Si(OSi)4), suggesting that the condensation has proceeded.39 The 13C NMR spectrum was dominated by a peak
at 135 ppm, which corresponds to the superposition of unresolved signals
from o- and m-carbons in the phenylene ring (Figure 2b).39 There were
two additional peaks at 30 and 53 ppm, which were assigned to aliphatic
groups (Si–O–CH2CH3). The 29Si MAS NMR spectra of AZO-E exhibited two resonances with
a degree of condensation of ca. 84% (Figure 2a). The first resonance (−71.6 ppm)
was attributed to T2(CSi(OSi)2(OH)), a partially
condensed silica species with one hydroxyl group and the other (−80.7
ppm) was assigned to T3(CSi(OSi)3), a fully
condensed silicon with three siloxane bonds.39 Virtually, no peak was detected for SiO4 species (Si
sites attached to four oxygen atoms Qn, n = 1–4) between −98 and −111
ppm, indicating essentially no evidence for Si–C bond cleavage
during the sol–gel processing and synthesis.40 The 13C MAS NMR spectrum showed the presence
of a signal at 5 ppm (Figure 2b). This is due to the −CH2–CH2– groups covalently linked to two Si atoms.41,42

spectra of AZO-B and AZO-E.

XRD analysis was performed to study the structure arrangement
and
phase purity of the AZO NPs. The low-angle XRD patterns for AZO-B
and AZO-E show dominant diffraction peaks (100) at 2θ = 2.2
with a spacing of d = 4.02 nm and 2θ = 1.74
with a spacing of d = 5.08 nm, indicating a two-dimensional
hexagonal symmetry (p6mm) of the
materials (Figure 3).43 The corresponding lattice constants
of the (100) reflection were found to be 4.65 nm for AZO-B and 5.87
nm for AZO-E, which support the mesoscale-periodicity of the NPs.9,43 AZO-B low-angle XRD spectrum shows two additional diffraction peaks,
which can be indexed as (110) and (200) reflections as shown in Figure 3a. The high-angle
XRD patterns of AZO-B displayed additional three diffraction peaks
at 2θ = 11.6°, 23.4°, and 35.4° which equates
to d = 0.76, 0.38, and 0.25 nm, respectively (Figure 3b).

Figure 3 (a) Low- and (b) high-angle
XRD patterns of AZO-B and AZO-E samples.

Nitrogen adsorption–desorption of AZO-B and AZO-E
showed
type IV isotherm, which is characteristic of a mesoporous material
(Figure S5).44 The structural information on both systems is listed in Table S1. The AZO-B-specific surface area, pore
volume, and pore size were 1211 m2/g, 0.84 cm3/g, and 1.6 nm, respectively. The AZO-E shows an increase in the
pore size to 2.7 nm, but the specific surface area and pore volume
are comparable to AZO-B (1190 m2/g and 0.85 cm3/g, respectively). These results suggest that the AZO linker plays
a significant role in controlling the pore size of the NPs. The pore
size distribution of the materials was obtained by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
method.45 Both samples have uniform pore
size distributions with a dominant peak center at 1.6 nm for AZO-B
and 2.7 nm for AZO-E, which is in agreement with the pore dimensions
estimated from the high-resolution TEM images. The measured pore width
by TEM was about 2–3 nm, which is in good agreement with the
nitrogen isotherm results.

Biodegradation of NPs has recently
become a hot research topic
because of the impact of these lingering nanoplatforms on the environment
and general health. Hundreds of nanoformulations exist in the market
predominantly in the personal care and cosmetics industry. Crystallinity
and order in these systems have proved crucial for their toxicity
and consequently intended use.46 Targeted
drug delivery is also an important application of enzymatically degradable
NPs.47 We thus tested the biodegradation
of AZO-B and AZO-E to verify the effect on decomposition. Mimicking
a reducing tumor microenvironment, a biological media containing the
azoreductase enzyme in the presence of coenzyme NADPH was used in
this study. Azoreductase can reductively cleave the azo-bond and has
been used enormously in colon-specific drug delivery systems such
as a prodrug sulfasalazine.48−55 The biodegradation of AZO-B and AZO-E in the azoreductase enzyme
was monitored by TEM over a period of 24 h (Figure 4). Interestingly, AZO-B degraded faster than
AZO-E, which may be attributed to the relatively smaller pores. Although
such assemblies are considered more stable, the close proximity of
bonds interacting with the active site of the azoreductase enzyme
might be enhancing the rate of biodegradation.

and (b) AZO-E before and after degradation
in azoreductase enzyme in the presence of NADPH for 3 and 24 h.

We then tested biocompatibility
and the utility of such system
in targeted drug delivery. Colon cancer cells, HCT-116 cells, were
used for all in vitro testings. Both AZO-B and AZO-E exhibit no significant
cytotoxicity against HCT-116 cells at a high concentration of 100
μg/mL (Figure 5). However, AZO-E showed a safer profile where 95% of the cells were
viable at a NP concentration of 100 μg/mL compared with 60%
when AZO-B was used.

Figure 5 Cell viability in colon cancer (HCT-116) cells of AZO-B
and AZO-E.

Both systems were then loaded
with the anticancer drug doxorubicin
(DOX) and tested in physiological media before in vitro incubation
with HCT-116 cells. The release experiments were carried out in the
presence and absence of the azoreductase enzyme and NADPH coenzyme. Figure 6a shows that DOX
release was initiated by the presence of the azoreductase enzyme.
A negligible amount of DOX was released in the absence of the enzyme,
and the system was not leaking as can be concluded from the release
profile (Figure 6a).
DOX was efficiently loaded in AZO-NPs, and incubation of AZO-B and
AZO-E with HCT-116 cells showed efficient uptake and delivery of DOX
into cancer cells under hypoxic conditions (Figure 6b). Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM)
images showed an increase in red fluorescence of DOX molecules when
AZO-NPs are used, which is in agreement with the drug release profile
that showed a higher drug release profile for AZO-B compared with
AZO-E. Furthermore, 3D intracellular fluorescence reconstruction of
the uptake and delivery is presented in Figure S6. As a control, AZO-B and AZO-E were incubated with HCT-116
cells in the absence nonhypoxic conditions and showed no drug release
because of negligible amounts of NP degradation.

of AZO-B and AZO-E in the absence and
presence of the azoreductase enzyme. (b) CLSM images of HCT-116 cells
incubated with DOX loaded AZO-B and AZO-E under hypoxia for 1 h. Nuclei
are stained in blue with Hoechst 33342 dye, NPs appear with the green
fluorescence (fluorescein isothiocyanate) and DOX fluorescence in
cells (red).

Chicken embryos were
transplanted with OVCAR-8 ovarian cancer cells,
expressing green fluorescent protein. Loaded NPs with DOX were injected
into the blood vessels followed by daily monitoring of tumor sizes
relative to controls. Figure 7 shows that the injection of drug-loaded NPs has potent antitumor
activity without any other toxic effects on organs. Administration
of NPs loaded with DOX results in a dramatic tumor shrinkage relative
to control over time. AZO-B showed a drastic decrease in the tumor
size just after two days of injection compared with AZO-E, while safely
retaining the function of all other organs.

3 Conclusion
Studying pore wall packing will
lead to interesting hybrid platforms
that can be smart in nature. This molecular scale ordering will drastically
influence the properties of these frameworks. Engineering materials
to have a different pore size is well established. However, we need
to investigate the overall properties of these materials, especially
when it comes to stability and responsiveness. In this work, we showed
that closer pore packing in AZO-B enhanced the enzymatic biodegradation
of these hybrid frameworks compared with AZO-E. Understanding pore
wall packing and assembly of linkers within the space will lead to
superior porous materials that can make it closer to scale-up and
eventual market use.

4.1 Materials and Methods
Cetyltrimethylammonium
bromide (CTAB), 1,4-bis(triethoxysilyl)benzene, 1,2-bis(trimethoxysilyl)ethane,
4-nitrobenzoic acid, glucose, thionyl chloride, tetrahydrofuran [THF;
anhydrous, ≥99.9% (dry THF)], trimethylamine, and 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and phosphate
buffered saline [(10×), pH 7.4] were purchased from Fisher. Milli-Q
water was used in all synthetic experiments. All chemicals were used
without further purification.

4.2 Instrumentation
Powder XRD measurements
were performed using a PANalytical X’Pert Pro X-ray powder
diffractometer using the Cu Kα radiation (40 V, 40 mA, λ
= 1.54056 Å) in a θ–θ mode from 20° to
90° (2θ). TEM images, EELS, and EDX were recorded using
a Tecnai 12 T (FEI Co.) microscope operated at 120 kV. The GIF was
used in the EELS mode in conjunction with high angle annular dark
field–STEM. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms
were acquired using a Micromeritics ASAP 2420 instrument. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were performed at 500 MHz with
CDCl3 solutions with an AVANCE III Bruker Corporation instrument.
For solid NMR spectra were carried out by using a Bruker 400 MHz AVANCE
III NMR spectrometer (resonating at 100.64 MHz for 13C
and 79.514 MHz for 29Si) equipped with double resonance
4 mm Bruker MAS probe (Bruker BioSpin, Rheinstetten, Germany). To
be able to spin the samples were finely ground then packed evenly
into 4 mm zirconia rotor and sealed at the open end with a Vespel
cap. The 29Si spectra were recorded with 14 kHz spinning
rate using one pulse program from Bruker standard pulse library with
30° flipping angle with recycle delay time of 30 s. The 13C spectra were recorded using cross polarization CP MAS experiments
using the CP pulse program. Each 13C NMR spectrum was recorded
by collecting 12k scans while the 29Si NMR spectrum was
recorded with 4k scans at room temperature. Bruker Topspin 3.2 software
(Bruker BioSpin, Rheinstetten, Germany) was used for data collection
and analysis. FT-IR spectra were recorded using a Thermo Scientific
spectrometer (Nicolet iS10). Absorption spectra were recorded using
a Varian Cary 5000 spectrophotometer, and fluorescence data were collected
using a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorimeter.

4.3 Synthesis
of AZO-B and AZO-E NPs
A mixture of CTAB (250 mg, 0.68 mmol),
distilled water (120 mL),
and NaOH (875 μL, 2 M) was stirred at 85 °C for 30 min
in a 250 mL round-bottom flask. The azo precursor (165 μL, 0.20
mmol) was added to the solution, followed by 1,4-bis(triethoxysilyl)benzene
(400 μL, 1.0 mmol), and the condensation process was conducted
for 2 h at 85 °C. After that, the solution was cooled to room
temperature under stirring. The sample was then extracted by using
an ultrasonic bath with an alcoholic solution of ammonium nitrate
(6 g L–1) at 45 °C for 30 min and washed three
times with ethanol, water, and ethanol. The as-prepared material was
dried under vacuum. The synthesis of AZO-E NPs was synthesized as
described for the AZO-B NPs above with an 1,2-bis(trimethoxysilyl)ethane
precursor (250 μL, 1.0 mmol) instead of the 1,4-bis(triethoxysilyl)benzene
precursor.
