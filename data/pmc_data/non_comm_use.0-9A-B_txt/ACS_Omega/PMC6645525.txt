Beam diversity enables
antenna arrays to play important roles in
radar, communications, imaging, and next-generation wireless systems.
However, achieving flexible control of beams in a low-cost way is
still very challenging. Here, we propose low-profile planar antenna
arrays with coding elements to control and engineer radiation patterns
more freely and flexibly. The proposed planar antenna array consists
of binary radiating elements which are characterized by digital codes
“0” and “1”. By designing spatial coding
patterns of the radiating elements, multifarious functionalities can
be well realized, such as beam splitting, beam scanning, and beam
deflection. More importantly, coding metasurfaces can be properly
arranged around the digital radiating elements to reduce the radar
cross section of the antenna, while the radiation performance is well
preserved. The low-profile, high-gain, lightweight digital antenna
arrays are verified numerically and experimentally in the microwave
band. The proposed digital coding planar antenna arrays derive a new
paradigm to control the radiation patterns in low-overhead and advanced
digital design fashions and offer promising applications in multitasked
and intelligent antenna devices and new information systems.

1 Introduction
Antenna arrays have continuously
attracted extensive attention
and been widely investigated in physics and engineering because of
their high gain, wide coverage, and beam controllability.1−10 In recent years, to increase the communication capacity and boost
the multitasking capacity of the antennas for satisfying the growing
number of wireless communication users, beam-forming networks, a kind
of multi-input and multi-output feed networks, are widely studied
and applied in array antennas, which lead to the boom of switched
beam antennas, such as multibeam antennas11,12 and beam-scanning antennas.13,14 In general, the beam-forming
networks can be classified into matrix type and lens type.15−18 These two kinds of beam-forming networks have their own advantages,
and both can be used to enable array antennas to generate various
beam patterns. Despite the success of beam-forming networks in realizing
beam switching, design difficulties and high cost restrain their further
developments and applications toward miniaturization and integration.
Hence, realizing free controls of beams of antenna arrays using compact
feed networks and in a low-cost way still remains a big challenge.

More recently, the new concept, coding metamaterials or metasurfaces,
was proposed and realized by manipulating electromagnetic (EM) waves
in a digital way.19−24 By changing the spatial or frequency coding pattern (or coding sequence),
different scattering patterns can be easily achieved using the coding
metamaterials. Because of its great convenience in tailoring EM waves,
the digital coding method has been extended to acoustics25 and terahertz bands26−30 for realizing specific functional metadevices. Moreover,
because the units in the coding metamaterials are characterized by
finite discrete states (e.g., 1-bit coding has two digital states
of “0” and “1”), the active elements such
as diodes and varactors can be easily adopted to construct dynamic
reconfigurable devices or further achieve different functions in real
time by combining programmable devices.19,31−35

On the basis of the merit of the digital design method, the
simplest
digital signal processing, convolution operation, was successfully
performed on digital coding metasurfaces for the first time to steer
the scattering pattern to an arbitrarily predesigned direction, which
provides a new strategy to flexibly deflect the beams.36 More interestingly, the digital coding metasurfaces
have been recently evaluated using Shannon entropy from the information
perspective, which will offer unprecedented opportunities for realizing
many new concept information systems.37 Despite their exceptional capability to control the EM beams, however,
all the currently demonstrated digital coding metasurfaces, containing
reflection and transmission types, need a horn antenna or other forms
of antenna as their primary feed, which will bring some assembly problems
that result in larger volume, higher system complexity, and higher
cost.

In this work, we propose the concept of a low-profile
coding planar
antenna array without any complex air-feed structures. Different from
the previous work,19 the coding elements
in the digital antenna arrays are identical, but the “coding”
status is constructed and designed by the special planar feeding structures.
Such an ingenious design enables the antenna arrays to not only have
the advantage of low profile but also control the radiation beams
with great flexibility. Here, the planar coding antenna arrays are
preferentially implemented by a microstrip antenna array, which has
low profile and is simple. The realized coding microstrip antenna
array is composed of 16 microstrip radiating elements, and each radiating
element is characterized by the binary coding “0” or
“1”. Under different coding patterns, the digital microstrip
antenna arrays are able to generate the sum beam, dual beam, and quad
beam. Moreover, the convolution operations are realized for the first
time on the digital microstrip antenna arrays for further achieving
radiation pattern deflections because of the digitized design of the
microstrip antenna arrays. Furthermore, to reduce the radar cross
section (RCS) of the coding microstrip antenna array and avoid the
adverse effects on antenna performance, coding metasurfaces with given
coding patterns are designed and properly arranged around the digital
antenna elements. The above concepts and physical phenomena are theoretically
and numerically demonstrated and further experimentally verified by
five fabricated different samples in the microwave region.

2 Coding Antenna Design and Simulation Results
2.1 Design of a Digital Radiating Element
To realize the
aforementioned digital coding microstrip antenna arrays,
as illustrated in Figure 1a, we first design the low-profile microstrip antenna element
with the operating frequency of 3.5 GHz, as shown in Figure 1b. In our design, the substrate
of the microstrip antenna element is the low-loss dielectric material
F4B, which has a dielectric constant of 2.65 and a loss tangent of
0.001. The thickness of the substrate is 1.0 mm, which is just about
0.0117λ (λ is the free-space wavelength at 3.5 GHz). On
the top of the substrate, there are a rectangular radiation patch
and a feeding microstrip line. To realize impedance matching and also
reduce the overall size of the antenna element, a groove with a width
of g and a depth of d is opened
at the center of the bottom edge of the patch, and the microstrip
line is directly inserted into the groove to feed the patch. The length L and the width W of the patch are precalculated
by the design formulas of the microstrip antenna38 and further optimized by the software CST Microwave Studio.
Finally, the four optimized values of L, W, g, and d are chosen
as 26.2, 28.0, 6.8, and 8.0 mm, respectively.

Figure 1 (a) Schematic illustration
of a low-profile digital coding planar
antenna array and some radiation patterns for different digital coding
patterns. (b) Front view of the designed microstrip antenna element.
(c) Simulated reflection amplitude of the antenna element. The inset
shows the induced surface current distribution at the resonant frequency
of 3.5 GHz. (d) Simulated 2D far-field radiation patterns of the microstrip
antenna element.

The width w1 of the feeding microstrip
line is 2.8 mm, which is calculated by using the impedance calculation
plug-in incorporated in the CST for matching the 50 Ω input
impedance. The thickness of the patch, the microstrip line and the
metallic sheet backing of the substrate is selected as 0.018
mm, and other geometry parameters of the antenna element are adopted
as a = 45.0 mm, b = 55.0 mm, and h = 30.0 mm. The simulated amplitude of the reflection coefficient
S11 of the microstrip antenna element is less than −20
dB at the center frequency of 3.5 GHz, as shown in Figure 1c. The designed antenna element
has a strong resonance at 3.5 GHz, and its surface-induced current
distribution is illustrated in the inset of Figure 1c. The maximum radiation direction of the
antenna element is directed to the z-axis, and the
simulated gain of the antenna element is 6.86 dB at 3.5 GHz, as shown
in Figure 1d. It is
noted that in the following designed coding antenna arrays, the coding
elements are identical for each array, but the “coding”
status is constructed and designed by the special planar feeding lines.

2.2 Coding Sequence in One Direction
The proposed
first schematic of the low-profile digital coding microstrip
antenna array that consists of such 4 × 4 radiating elements
is illustrated in Figure 2a. The designed coding antenna array has four parallel main
feeding lines, which are simultaneously excited with equal amplitude
and phase by a four-way power divider fed by a 50 Ω coaxial
connector. Each main feeding line feeds four series antenna elements,
and each antenna element is connected to the main feeding line by
a quarter-wavelength impedance conversion line for realizing impedance
matching. Under the series–parallel hybrid feed network, the
four parallel antenna elements along the y direction
have the identical excitation current. However, the initial phases
of the excitation currents of the four antenna elements along the x direction depend on their connection positions on the
main feeding line because of the fact that the microwave signal is
transmitted to the four series antenna elements in turn through the
main feeding line. The width w2 of the
impedance conversion line is 1.55 mm and the length is λg/4. The guide wavelength λg of the microstrip
line is 1  where λ0 is the wavelength
in the free space and μr and εe are
the relative permeability and effective permittivity, respectively.
In our simulation, μr = 1, and εe is calculated by the impedance calculation plug-in. When w1 = 2.8 mm, εe = 2.18, and
then λg is 58.0 mm at 3.5 GHz; when w2 = 1.55 mm, εe = 2.10, and then λg is 58.8 mm at 3.5 GHz. The constant phase difference Δϕn between the two adjacent antenna elements
along the x direction is written as 2  

Figure 2 (a) First structure of the proposed low-profile digital
coding
microstrip antenna array. (b) Simulated surface-induced current distribution
of the coding antenna array at 3.5 GHz with the sequence of “0000”.
(c,d) 3D far-field radiation patterns of the coding antenna array
at 3.5 GHz with the sequences of “0000” (c) and “x-0101” (d). (e) 2D far-field radiation patterns
of the coding antenna array at 3.5 GHz with the sequences of “x-0011” and “x-0110”.

Hence, according to eq 2, the normalized phase difference
between the two adjacent antenna
elements can be tuned ranging from 0° to 360° by adjusting
the element spacing of dx1, dx2, and dx3.

For the 1-bit digital coding
array, we need two opposite phase
responses to mimic the digital “0” and “1”
states. Because the phase difference of the two adjacent antenna elements
in the microstrip antenna array can be tuned to 180°, these two
antenna elements are able to act as the binary “0” and
“1” elements, respectively. Hence, the proposed first
scheme of the microstrip antenna array is capable of realizing the
digital coding with different spatial coding sequences by flexibly
controlling the distances dx1, dx2, and dx3. Additionally, because the
digital states of the four parallel antenna elements are always the
same, we can simply use one “0” unit or “1”
unit to describe these four antenna elements.

To verify that
the designed digital coding microstrip antenna array
has the good performance of generating different spatial coding sequences,
we first set the distances as dx1 = dx2 = dx3 = 58.0 mm = λg, and the whole antenna array covers an area of 274 ×
320 mm2. According to eq 2, all the phase differences Δϕ1, Δϕ2, and Δϕ3 are
360°, which can be normalized to 0°. For this case, the
simulated surface-induced current distribution of the coding antenna
array at 3.5 GHz is shown in Figure 2b. We observe that the current directions of all the
radiating elements are the same, that is to say, the 16 radiating
elements indeed have the identical initial excitation phase. Hence,
the 16 antenna elements can be described by the binary elements that
have the same digital state. For example, we encode the digital antenna
element as the “0” element. In this case, the coding
sequence of the digital coding microstrip antenna array is “0000”.
The simulated three-dimensional (3D) far-field radiation pattern of
the digital coding microstrip antenna array with the sequence “0000”
at 3.5 GHz is shown in Figure 2c. We observe that the coding microstrip antenna array generates
a sum beam directed to the z-axis, and the gain is
18.8 dB.

In order to realize the coding sequence of “x-0101” (“x-” denotes
the sequences
varying along the x direction), theoretically, we
shall adjust dx1, dx2, and dx3 to λg/2 for achieving
a 180° phase difference. However, when the element spacing is
λg/2, the distance between the two adjacent antenna
elements is too small, which will cause strong coupling and affect
the radiating element performance. We set dx1, dx2, and dx3 as 87.0 mm,
which is equal to 3λg/2, and the coding microstrip
antenna array totally covers an area of 361 × 320 mm2. Hence, all the phase differences Δϕ1, Δϕ2, and Δϕ3 can be normalized to 180°.
In such a case, the sum beam has split into two main beams symmetrically
distributed in the xoz-plane, and the gain is 17.7
dB at 3.5 GHz, as shown in Figure 2d. The main beam direction angle can be predicted by30 3   4  in which Γx and Γy represent the physical
periodic lengths of the coding sequence along the x and y directions, respectively. For the coding
sequence “x-0101”, by substituting
λ0 = 85.7 mm (at 3.5 GHz), Γx = 174.0 mm, and Γy →
∞ into eqs 3 and 4, we obtain an elevation angle θ = 29°
and two azimuth angles ϕ = 0° and ϕ = 180°,
respectively, which are in good agreement with the simulation results.

Additionally, we also give two other coding sequences of “x-0011” and “x-0110”
that can both generate two symmetrical beams emitting with different
direction angles, respectively, as shown in Figure 2e. Under the coding sequence “x-0110”, the elevation angle θ of the main
beam is 13°; under the coding sequence “x-0011”, the elevation angle θ of the main beam is 20°.
To realize the coding sequence “x-0011”,
we chose dx1 = dx3 = 58.0 mm and dx2 = 87.0 mm, and we set dx1 = dx3 = 87.0 mm and dx2 = 58.0 mm for achieving the coding sequence “x-0110”.

2.3 Coding Sequences in Both
Directions
The proposed digital coding microstrip antenna
array can generate
one-direction different spatial coding sequences to realize beam splitting
and scanning in the x direction. To further realize
the digital coding microstrip antenna array that can also generate
coding sequences varying along the y direction, we
present and design the second schematic of the microstrip antenna
array, as shown in Figure 3a. The coding microstrip antenna array has two parallel main
feeding lines, and each main feeding line excites four series antenna
pairs along the x direction. Each antenna pair contains
two parallel microstrip radiating elements, which are located symmetrically
beside the line. The initial phases of the excitation currents of
the two radiating elements have a 180° phase difference because
of the mirror relation and the identical excitation mode. Hence, the
two antenna elements in one antenna pair can be encoded as the binary
elements, mimicking digital “0” and “1”,
respectively. The coding microstrip antenna array is fed by a two-way
power divider, which is finally connected to a 50 Ω coaxial
connector.

microstrip antenna array. (b) Simulated surface-induced current distribution
of the coding antenna array at 3.5 GHz with the sequence of “y-0101”. (c,d) 3D far-field radiation patterns of
the coding antenna array at 3.5 GHz with the sequences of “y-0101” (c) and “x-0101/y-0101” (d). (e) Simulated S11 amplitudes
of the six different digital coding microstrip antenna arrays.

When dx1 = dx2 = dx3 = 58.0 mm, the
whole antenna array has
a dimension of 254 × 370 mm2, and the simulated surface-induced
current distribution of the coding microstrip antenna array at 3.5
GHz is shown in Figure 3b. It is clear that the current directions of the two radiating elements
in each antenna pair are opposite, and the four series antenna elements
have the same current direction, which can be encoded as “0”
unit or “1” unit. Hence, the coding microstrip antenna
array has the coding sequence of “y-0101”,
where “y-” denotes varying sequences
along the y direction. For this case, the coding
microstrip antenna array generates two symmetrical main beams with
the deviation angle of 24° in the yoz-plane,
and the gain is 17.7 dB at 3.5 GHz, as shown in Figure 3c. For the coding sequence “y-0101”, Γx →
∞ and Γy = 205.4 mm, the
elevation angle θ and two azimuth angles ϕ can be theoretically
calculated by eqs 3 and 4 as 24.6°, 90°, and 270°, respectively,
which have excellent agreements with the simulations.

To further
realize the complex coding patterns in a two-dimensional
(2D) plane, we can change one of the three distances dx1, dx2, and dx3 to
obtain a 180° phase difference between the two series antenna
elements. For example, we set dx1, dx2, and dx3 as 87.0 mm. In such a case,
the digital microstrip antenna array will have the coding pattern
of “x-0101/y-0101”
(chessboard coding pattern). The simulated 3D far-field radiation
pattern of the coding microstrip antenna array with a dimension of
341 × 355 mm2 at 3.5 GHz is shown in Figure 3d. We observe that there are
four radiation beams in the upper-half space, which are directed to
the angles at (38°, 42°), (38°, 138°), (38°,
222°), and (38°, 318°), respectively. By substituting
Γx = 174.0 mm and Γy = 205.4 mm into eqs 3 and 4, we obtain θ = 40°
and ϕ = 40.2°, 139.8°, 220.2°, and 319.8°,
respectively, which agree well with the simulated results. The simulated
gain of the coding microstrip antenna array is 15.9 dB. We remark
that for the two coding patterns of “y-0101”
and “x-0101/y-0101”,
the length L of the microstrip antenna element has
been optimized as 26.5 mm for ensuring that the center frequency of
the coding microstrip antenna array is 3.5 GHz. It is noted that all
the S11 amplitudes of the above-mentioned six different
coding microstrip antenna arrays are below −18 dB at 3.5 GHz,
as shown in Figure 3e.

2.4 Convolution Operation on a Coding Antenna
Array
So far, we have realized different spatial coding patterns
based on the digital low-profile microstrip antenna arrays to achieve
the desired single-beam radiation, beam splitting (such as dual beams
and quad beams), and dual-beam scanning in the xoz-plane. Owing to the digital characteristics of the radiating elements
in the microstrip antenna array, we further realize the convolution
operation on the digital coding microstrip antenna array, which provides
a great freedom for steering the radiation pattern to a predesigned
direction. The concept of convolution operation is to mix a gradient
coding sequence on the original coding pattern, which is an analogy
to the single-carrier modulation in signal processing, and the final
mixed coding pattern formed by calculating the modulus of these two
coding matrices.36 According to eq 2, the phase difference
of the two adjacent antenna elements along the x direction
can be tuned to an arbitrary value between 0° and 360° by
changing the element spacing. Hence, we can achieve a specific gradient
phase distribution varying along the x direction
by tuning the distances dx1, dx2, and dx3 to the same value. As a proof of concept,
we take a 2-bit coding sequence of “x-00011011”
as the gradient coding sequence. The four digital codes “00”,
“01”, “10”, and “11” in
a 2-bit coding sequence “x-00011011”
represent four different phase states of (0° + φ0), (90° + φ0), (180° + φ0), and (270° + φ0), respectively, and φ0 refers to the intimal phase of the antenna element. In our
design, the distance between the two adjacent antenna elements is
set as 5λg/4 for achieving a 90° phase difference.
To clearly illustrate the convolution operations, we use number “0”
to “3” to denote the digits “00” to “11”,
respectively.

To schematically illustrate our design, we present
three mixed coding patterns and their corresponding 3D far-field radiation
patterns at 3.5 GHz, as shown in Figure 4. The three mixed coding patterns are achieved
by the moduli of gradient coding sequence “x-0123” and three original coding patterns, respectively. The
pattern of the gradient coding sequence “x-0123” is illustrated in Figure 4a, in which the blocks with four different
colors represent the “0”, “1”, “2”,
and “3” radiating element, respectively. When the gradient
coding pattern is added to the coding pattern “x-0202” in Figure 4bi, we get their modulus M1, as
shown in Figure 4bii.
The corresponding 3D radiation pattern is shown in Figure 4e, from which we observe that
the two beams distributed in the xoz-plane are both
deviated from the z-axis by an angle of 17°.
To realize the mixed coding pattern M1 at 3.5 GHz using the digital microstrip antenna array, the distances dx1, dx2, and dx3 are set as 101.5 mm, and the length L of
the antenna element is reoptimized as 25.9 mm.

radiation patterns by convolution operations
on the digital coding microstrip antenna arrays. (a) Gradient coding
sequence “x-0123” varying along the x direction. (b–d) Three mixed coding patterns M1, M2, and M3 realized by the moduli of the gradient coding
sequence “x-0123” and three original
coding patterns, respectively. (e–g) Simulated 3D far-field
radiation patterns of the digital coding microstrip antenna arrays
at 3.5 GHz with the mixed coding patterns M1, M2, and M3, respectively. (h) Corresponding S11 amplitudes of the
digital microstrip antenna arrays with the three different mixed coding
patterns. (i) Three original coding patterns. (ii) Three mixed coding
patterns.

The next example is achieved by
adding the gradient coding sequence
along the orthogonal direction. Figure 4ci,ii shows the coding pattern “y-0202” and its mixed coding pattern M2, respectively. For such a mixed coding pattern, the two beams
of the coding microstrip antenna array are also tilted away from the
normal axis by 17°, and then the two beams are redirected to
the angles of (44°, 63°) and (44°, 297°), respectively,
as shown in Figure 4f. In such a case, the distances dx1, dx2, and dx3 are chosen as 72.5 mm, and
the length h is optically set as 10 mm for suppressing
the grating lobe.

Figure 4dii illustrates
the mixed coding pattern M3 formed by
the modulus of the coding sequence “x-0123”
and the chessboard coding “x-0202/y-0202” in Figure 4di for shifting multiple beams. In this case, all the
four beams of the coding microstrip antenna array are deflected, and
the deflection angle is 16°, as shown in Figure 4g. The distances dx1, dx2, and dx3 are given
as 101.5 mm to realize this mixed coding pattern.

For the designed
2-bit gradient coding sequence “x-0123”,
the deviation angles from the z-axis of the three
different demonstrated mixed coding patterns M1, M2, and M3 are the same and can be predicted by36 5  

In this case, the
periodic length Γx = 290.0 mm, which
is 5λ0. Hence, substituting
λ0 = 85.7 mm and Γx = 290.0 mm into eq 5, the deviation angle θd is calculated as 17.2°,
which is in excellent agreement with the simulation result. It should
be noted that according to our simplification, the coding patterns
“x-0202”, “y-0202”, and “x-0202/y-0202” in Figure 4 represent the aforementioned coding sequences of “x-0101”, “y-0101”,
and “x-0101/y-0101”,
respectively. The dimensions of the three antenna arrays are 404.5
× 320 mm2, 297.5 × 250 mm2, and 384.5
× 355 mm2, and the simulated gains are 18.2, 14.5,
and 17.1 dB, respectively. All the simulated amplitudes of S11 of the digital microstrip antenna arrays with three different mixed
coding patterns are below −17 dB at the operating frequency
of 3.5 GHz, as plotted in Figure 4h.

2.5 Simultaneous Control of
the Radiating and
Scattering Beam
Next, we also study the scattering characteristics
of the proposed digital coding microstrip antenna arrays. In a high-frequency
region, such as X-, K-, and Ka-bands, the backscattering of the coding
microstrip antenna array will be very strong as the EM waves are projected
onto the antenna array because of a larger ratio of antenna aperture
to wavelength. The significant scattering is detrimental for the realization
of the antenna stealth, especially in military applications.39,40 To reduce the scattering from the coding microstrip antenna array
and meanwhile maintain its good radiation performance, we reasonably
arrange the designed 1-bit digital coding metasurfaces around the
radiating elements of the antenna array.

To construct the 1-bit
digital coding metasurface, we first design a metasurface particle
with subwavelength size. On both sides of the 1 mm thickness F4B substrate,
there are a square metallic patch with a tunable width e and a ground, respectively, as shown in the inset of Figure 5a. The side length of the digital
particle is 6.5 mm. Figure 5a shows the simulated reflection phases of the two particles
with e = 6.0 mm and e = 6.3 mm,
respectively. It is obvious that the phase difference is approximately
180° from 8.8 to 10.0 GHz. Hence, we use the particle with e = 6.0 mm to mimic “0” element and that with e = 6.3 mm to mimic “1” element.

and “1” elements and the corresponding reflection phases

GHz under the normally x-polarized incident wave

radiation pattern of the low-scattering digital antenna array with
the coding pattern “x-0101/y-0101”. (h) Return loss of the low-scattering coding antenna
array.

We take the digital microstrip
antenna array with the coding pattern
“x-0101/y-0101” as
a proof of principle to demonstrate our design for further realizing
the low-scattering coding microstrip antenna array. The structure
of the proposed low-scattering coding microstrip antenna array is
shown in Figure 5b.
Compared with the primary coding microstrip antenna array in Figure 3d, the low-scattering
coding microstrip antenna array is loaded with many coding metasurface
particles. To avoid the EM energy leaking from the radiating element
to the coding metasurface and also minimize the RCS of the antenna
array, some coding metasurfaces with chessboard-like coding patterns
are properly arranged around the radiating elements, as shown in the
inset of Figure 5b.
Note that the configurations of the radiating elements and the feed
network of the low-scattering antenna array are the same as those
of the primary coding antenna array in Figure 3d.

The 3D scattering pattern of the
low-scattering coding microstrip
antenna array at 9.0 GHz is shown in Figure 5c, from which we observe that the normally x-polarized incident waves have been reflected to many directions.
By contrast, the primary coding microstrip antenna array has only
one main scattering beam with the half power (3 dB) beam width of
4.7°, which is directed to the z-axis under
the normally x-polarized incident waves, as shown
in Figure 5d. We also
present two 3D scattering patterns of the low-scattering coding microstrip
antenna array and the primary coding microstrip antenna array in the
case of the y-polarized EM waves vertical incidence,
as shown in Figure 5e,f, respectively. It is obvious that the monostatic RCS reductions
are larger than 10.0 dB and that the bistatic RCSs are also effectively
suppressed for both x- and y-polarized
incident waves at 9.0 GHz.

Moreover, the radiation characteristic
of the low-scattering digital
microstrip antenna array with the coding pattern “x-0101/y-0101” is well preserved, as shown
in Figure 5g. It is
clear that the low-scattering coding antenna array also exhibits an
interesting four-beam splitting phenomenon, and the four beams are
directed to the angles at (38°, 42°), (38°, 138°),
(38°, 222°), and (38°, 318°), respectively. The
simulated gain is 15.9 dB at 3.5 GHz. The return loss of the low-scattering
coding microstrip antenna array is less than −30 dB at 3.5
GHz, as shown in Figure 5h.

3 Experimental Results
To experimentally
verify the proposed concepts and design strategies,
five samples of the digital microstrip antenna arrays with different
coding configurations were fabricated and measured in the microwave
chamber, as shown in Figure 6a. Because the computer-assisted testing turntable can only
be rotated continuously by 360° in the horizontal plane (yoz-plane), only radiation beams distributed in the yoz-plane are measured. Hence, for testing the beams of
the coding microstrip antenna arrays that do not appear in the yoz-plane, we rotate the samples S3 and S5 counterclockwise by 48° and the sample S4 clockwise by 27° based on the simulated 3D radiation patterns,
as illustrated in the photographs of Figure 6a. We adopt a horn antenna with a gain of
15 dB working from 3.2 to 4.9 GHz as the standard gain horn for measuring
the gains of the coding microstrip antenna arrays.

Figure 6 (a) Far-field experimental
environment and photographs of five
fabricated digital coding microstrip antenna arrays. (b–e)
Measured 2D far-field radiation patterns of four fabricated digital
microstrip antenna arrays corresponding to the digital coding patterns
“0000”, “y-0101”, “x-0101/y-0101”, and M2, respectively. (f) Measured 2D far-field radiation pattern
of the fabricated low-scattering digital microstrip antenna array
with the coding pattern “x-0101/y-0101”. (g) Measured S11 amplitudes of the five
fabricated samples. (h) Measured monostatic RCS reduction of the low-scattering
digital microstrip antenna array from 8.5 to 11.0 GHz.

The measured 2D far-field radiation patterns of
the samples S1, S2, and S3 at 3.5
GHz with coding
patterns “0000”, “y-0101”,
and “x-0101/y-0101”
are shown in Figure 6b–d, respectively. It is obvious that the coding microstrip
antenna array S1 has a main beam at θ = 0°.
The measured gain is 18.6 dB. The coding microstrip antenna array
S2 indeed generates two symmetrical beams at the elevation
angles of ±24°, and the measured gain is 17.5 dB. We observe
that there are also two main beams (around ±38°) of the
coding microstrip antenna array S3 and that the measured
gain is 15.7 dB. Figure 6e shows the measured 2D far-field radiation pattern of the sample
S4 at 3.5 GHz with the mixed coding pattern M2, from which we clearly observe one radiation beam with
a gain of 14.3 dB appearing at the angle of 45°. The 2D far-field
radiation pattern of the low-scattering coding microstrip antenna
array S5 is illustrated in Figure 6f. We also observe that there are two beams
at angles ±38° and the measured gain is 15.7 dB, which are
the same as the ones in Figure 6d. Meanwhile, the low-scattering coding microstrip antenna
array is able to reduce monostatic RCS more than 7 dB from 8.5 to
11.0 GHz (about 25.6% relative bandwidth) for both x and y polarizations, as shown in Figure 6h. All the measured radiation
patterns and gains are in good agreement with the simulation results.
The measured reflection coefficients of the five different fabricated
digital coding microstrip antenna arrays are plotted in Figure 6g. It is clear that the return
losses of the five samples are all below −20 dB at the working
frequency of 3.5 GHz.

4 Conclusions
To summarize,
we have proposed and confirmed the concept of low-profile
digital coding microstrip antenna arrays to realize free controls
of radiation beams. Digital information technologies of coding and
digital convolution were effectively implemented in the designed microstrip
antenna array consisting of 16 digital radiating elements for achieving
beam splitting and scanning and radiation pattern deflection, respectively.
Moreover, a class of low-scattering digital coding microstrip antenna
arrays was also proposed and realized using coding metasurfces. This
kind of coding antenna array not only possesses excellent radiation
performance but also has lower RCS, which shows enormous potential
in military applications. As the proof of concept, five different
digital coding microstrip antenna arrays were fabricated and measured.
The measured results agree very well with the simulation ones. One
of the most significant advantages of the proposed coding antenna
arrays is using planar feeding structures to construct the coding
elements, which enable the coding antenna arrays to have the merits
of low profile, easy conformal, high spatial utilization, lightweight,
and low cost. Benefited from the digitized design method, an efficient
and considerably less expensive approach for achieving the diversity
of radiation beams, the proposed low-profile digital coding microstrip
antenna arrays offer an alternative approach to produce switched beam
antennas and huge potential to profoundly advance the relevant fields.

It is noted that the proposed methods are not limited to construct
the passive coding microstrip antenna arrays. The approach can be
further extended to realize the dynamically reconfigurable or even
programmable low-profile digital coding microstrip antenna arrays
by adopting PIN diodes and relevant programmable devices for generating
various radiation patterns in real time.
