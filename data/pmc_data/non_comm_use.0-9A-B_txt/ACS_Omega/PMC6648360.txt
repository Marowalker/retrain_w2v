Density-driven convection, which
can accelerate the dissolution
rate of carbon dioxide (CO2) in resident brine, is critical
for the long-term fate of the injected CO2 permanence and
security of CO2 geological storage. Visualization experiments
and pressure–volume–temperature (PVT) testing were conducted
to investigate the influence from gravitational convection. For investigate
gravitational instabilities and convective diffusion, we designed
a Hele-Shaw cell rated to 70 MPa and Rayleigh number of 346 to conduct
visualization experiments with the micro-schlieren technique. The
average diffusion coefficient and time-dependent values were measured
in the PVT experiments. We also calculated the convection parameters,
including Rayleigh number and critical onset time, with a series of
PVT testing at the temperature ranging 293.15–423.15 K and
pressure ranging 14–24 MPa by using the constant-pressure method.
Through visualization experiments, we observed convective currents
triggered by the density gradient in the gas–liquid interface,
which noticeably enhanced the CO2 dissolution rate. The
PVT testing confirmed that the diffusion coefficient increased sharply
under the influence of the gravitational convection at the early stage
and then decreased toward the average diffusion coefficient with time.
The PVT testing also demonstrated the Rayleigh number increasing with
temperature or pressure increasing under the reservoir conditions.
The gravitational convection will be more likely to occur and more
rapid with a greater pressure or higher temperature.

Introduction
Gravitational Convection
The growing
concern about
CO2 emission urged people to investigate the solutions
of CO2 over emission. CO2 geological storage
in the aquifers or depleted oil reservoirs is one of the optimal techniques
to prevent CO2 from entering the atmosphere.1,2

Dissolution trapping is an important mechanism, which usually
captures two-thirds of the total storage volume.3,4 The
molecular diffusion of CO2 in brine is woefully slow.5 The key issue for accurate assessment of the
dissolution trapping is the dissolution rate. As illustrated in Figure 1, many mechanisms
accelerate the diffusion of CO2 in brine and involve dispersion,6 advection, and gravitational convection.7

Figure 1 Schematic illustration of fluid dynamics and trapping
associated
with CO2 geological storage in real formation, wherein
the free CO2 can be laterally displaced beneath the caprock8 by combinations of the volumetric flux of injected
CO2 (Q) and the aquifer slope (θ).

Among these mechanisms, advection
is the dominant driving force
because lower vertical permeability may reduce the gravitational convection
while potentially increasing transverse mixing.9 Nevertheless, the gravitational convective diffusion can
greatly enhance the CO2 mixing efficiency, storage capacity,
and mass transfer rate.10 Gravitational
convection mitigates the risk of CO2 leakage to provide
a long-term storage security11 by driving
CO2 sinking rather than rising to shallower formations.
Therefore, gravitational convection is critical for the long-term
fate of CO2 and the security of storage.1,8

Convective Parameters
The CO2 dissolution
can result in a 2–3% density increase of brines;12 the slight increment of density in brine will
lead to gravitational instability9,13 and convection
currents.10,14 Moreover, the convection will accelerate
the dissolution of CO2 into the brine, further enhance
the mass transfer rate, and shorten the dissolution time.15 The density-driven convection is sometimes referred
to as Rayleigh–Taylor instability.9 Based on the Boussinesq approximation, the density-driven flow can
be described as a mixed equation of the mass conservation equation
and Fick’s second law16 1  where v is
the velocity (or volume-averaged velocity).

The incompressible
Navier–Stokes equation can describe the density-driven convective
diffusion as 2  

The most common criterion to indicate the occurrence of natural
convection is Rayleigh number (Rac),17 which is a dimensionless measure as a ratio of free convection
to diffusion7,8 3  where K is
the effective permeability; Δρ is the excess density of
CO2-rich brine over fresh brine; g is
the gravitational acceleration (g = 9.8015 m/s2 in Beijing); H is the vertical thickness
of diffusion, which is less the height of model; ϕ is the porosity;
μ is the viscosity of CO2-rich brine; and D is the CO2 diffusion coefficient.

For
a Hele-Shaw cell with uniform aperture thickness, the porosity
is 1, and its effective permeability can be calculated as18,19 4  where b is
the aperture thickness of the Hele-Shaw cell.

Only when the
diffusive layer becomes thick enough that the Rayleigh
number exceeds a critical value (Rac); the gravitational
instabilities can be triggered by perturbations in the diffusion layer.20 Nield21 offered a
method to measure the critical value under various boundary conditions.
The critical Rayleigh number is 32.5 as estimated by Slim and Ramakrishnan22 based on the linear stability analysis, 55 as
estimated by Szulczewski et al.,23 and
31.5 as estimated by Slim24 through the
theoretical analysis of the dissolution rate. Some studies7,16,25 suggested that the appropriate
critical value should be 4π2 with the associated
critical wavenumber (λc) of π, which is also
used in this paper.

A critical onset time (tc) and critical
wavelength (λc) were widely used to predict the gravitational
instabilities. Both the onset time and critical wavelength depend
on porosity and permeability.14

The
critical onset time tc can be predicted
as20 5  where α1 and
α2 are the parameters for the onset time of convection.
The parameter α1 is 130 as reported by Hassanzadeh
et al.26 The parameter α1 offered by Teng et al.27,28 is 48.7. We believe
that the parameter α1 should range from 45 to 130.

The critical wavelength λc can be calculated as 6  

It is reported
that the density-driven convection enhances the
CO2 dissolution rate with the increase in Rayleigh number.29 Islam et al.5 indicated
that effective convection occurred only at a limited range of scales
when Rayleigh numbers exceeded the critical value.

Hele-Shaw Experiments
Visualization study with the
Hele-Shaw cell30 apparatus is one of the
primary methods used to investigate the mechanisms of the CO2 natural convection. Kneafsey and Pruess25 once performed CO2 convective dissolution in transparent
vertical Hele-Shaw cells that contained water overlain by a gas phase
at atmospheric pressure. Backhaus et al.31 investigated the instability of initial convective dissolution with
a Hele-Shaw cell (6000 < Ra < 90000) to determine the rates
of CO2 dissolution trapping in brine at atmospheric pressure.
Slim et al.18 described the CO2 convection behavior in brine from the first contact to 65% average
saturation with a Hele-Shaw cell (100 < Ra < 1700) at atmospheric
pressure. Mojtaba et al.32 observed the
convective instabilities of CO2 in a Hele-Shaw cell (182
< Ra < 20860) under 3.45 MPa. Vosper et al.33 studied the process of CO2 dissolution and convection
in water under low pressure with a Hele-Shaw cell filled with transparent
glass beads. Faisal et al.19 used a catalytic
combustion-based total carbon analyzer to determine CO2 mass transfer in a Hele-Shaw cell (3277.88 < Ra < 36,420.87)
at atmospheric pressure. Vreme et al.34 studied the gravitational instability triggered by CO2 dissolution through a water–gas interface with a Hele-Shaw
experiment. Lu et al.35 invented a Hele-Shaw
cell that can perform under a high gas pressure of 10 MPa, and experimental
results only in the atmosphere pressure were exhibited. Tani36 established the classical solvability of the
one-phase Hele-Shaw problem and justified the vanishing coefficient
of the time derivative in the parabolic equation based on Hele-Shaw
cell experiments at low pressure. Thomas et al.37 conducted CO2 convective dissolution in a Hele-Shaw
cell and found that the increase in the salt concentration hindered
the development of the instability, increased the wavelength of the
convective pattern, and decreased the growth rate and velocity of
fingers. Mahmoodpour et al.38 designed
a novel Hele-Shaw cell (2919 < Ra < 4841) and presented the
first experiments of dissolution-driven convection of CO2 in a confined brine-saturated porous medium at pressures up to 3.69
MPa (535.3 psi).

One key issue for the convection experiment
with Hele-Shaw cell is the way to detect the variations of CO2 concentration for visualization purposes. The traditional
acid–base indicators cannot capture the full extent of the
convection.39 The research on color indicator
demonstrated that the observed patterns and the instabilities may
not depend on the presence of a color indicator.40,41 However, most of the studies visualizing convective patterns with
color indicators ignore the concentration.39

Micro-schlieren technique is sensitive to the CO2 concentration
based on the deflection of light by a refractive index gradient.42 Through comparison between the reference and
shadowgraph, the noise has been reduced, and the contrast has been
improved. The shadow pattern is a light-intensity representation of
the low-density regions and high-density regions, which characterizes
the well-defined convective flow.43

The schlieren images can reflect the changes in the refractive
index (n) that is directly related to the density
gradient. The relation between density (ρ) and refractive index
is described by using the Gladstone–Dale relation44 7  where n is
the refractive index, ρ is the density, KP and KC are the Gladstone–Dale
constants, KP reflects the physical refractive
energy, and KC reflects the chemical refractive
energy of fluid. The Gladstone–Dale compatibility, 1 –
(KP/KC), is
0.037 for the ideal formula. 8  where Ci is the weight percentage of each constituent, and ki are the specific constants of the chemical
data.

PVT Testing
There are a few experimental studies about
the convective diffusion in the pressure–volume–temperature
(PVT) cell at reservoir conditions.3 Yang
and Gu45 calculated the CO2 mass
transfer rate in resident brine with a visual high-pressure PVT cell
and the pressure decay method. Mojtaba et al.32 performed quantitative experiments with the PVT cell at elevated
pressure and provided an estimation of the convective dissolution
of CO2 in brine. Khosrokhavar3 studied the CO2 transfer rate for both fresh brine and
brine in pressure constant experiments. The results revealed that
the mass transfer rate was much faster than the prediction by Fick’s
law in the absence of natural convection.

Based on the conservation
laws, the total amount of dissolved CO2 can be calculated
as follows 9  where P is
the pressure of supercritical fluid in the PVT cell; V0 and Vt are volumes of supercritical
fluid or gas at time 0 and t, respectively; Vs is the sampling volume; c0 and ct are concentrations
of CO2 in supercritical fluid or gas at time 0 and t, respectively; Z is the compressibility
factor of supercritical fluid or gas; R is the universal
gas constant (8.3145 J/(mol·K)); T is the temperature;
and t is the diffusion time.

For the pure Fickian
diffusion, many researchers18,46,47 derived separately a same relationship between
the mole number of dissolved CO2 and diffusion coefficient 10  where nt is the mole number of dissolved CO2 at time t; A is the area of gas–liquid
interface; Cs is the molar concentration
or molarity of
saturated CO2 dissolved in liquid. The concentration Cs of saturated CO2 can be obtained
by the following relation 11  where ns is the mole number of gas released from the sample at atmospheric
pressure, P0 is the atmospheric pressure, Vs0 is the volume of the released gas, and T0 is the temperature of water bath.

According
to eq 10, the time-dependent
diffusion coefficient was calculated as 12  

Chemical
Potential and Reaction Equilibrium
The chemical
potential of gaseous or supercritical CO2 (scCO2) is48 13  where μ(g) is the chemical
potential of supercritical CO2, and μθ(g) is the standard chemical potential, and Pθ is the standard pressure.

The chemical potential
of CO2 in aqueous solution is 14  

Gibbs free energy of solution is48 15  where G is
the Gibbs free energy, ΔHmix is
the enthalpy change, and ΔSmix is
the entropy change. The traditional thermodynamic formula is 16  

CO2 has much weaker hydrogen bonding than H2CO3 to H2O.49 When
CO2 dissolves in water, CO2 undergoes a slight
hydration (∼0.26%) to H2CO3 (O=C(OH)2), results in acidic H2CO3 ionization,
and produces a number of carbonate ions with the following chemical
equilibria2        

Results and Discussion
Visualization Experiments
Figure 2 illustrates the
convection processes in
the Hele-Shaw experiments. The results were visualized using an optical
shadowgraph, which imaged the variation of density via the refraction
index.

Figure 2 Schlieren images and color schlieren density images of gravitational
convection in the Hele-Shaw cell after 5, 30, 60 and 120 min. The
view fields of all figures are 1 cm × 1 cm. Blue indicates fresh
brine, and the color turns from blue to red with the increase in CO2 concentrations.

In the Hele-Shaw experiments, CO2 started to dissolve
as soon as it contacted with the resident brine. The brine with dissolved
CO2 has a higher density than fresh brine.3 The density of fresh formation water tested with density
meters (Anton Paar, DMA HP) is 1.0036 g/mL under reservoir conditions,
and the density of CO2-saturated brine is 1.0275 g/mL.
The small increase in brine density is critical to forming convection.
It is well known that the Rayleigh–Taylor instability occurs
when high-density fluid suspends over lower-density fluid in a gravitational
field.50−52 With the increase in CO2 concentration,
the density increases, which can finally lead to gravitational instabilities
in the system.23

At the initial stage,
the CO2 dissolution occurred via
diffusion on the gas–liquid interface without convection. With
the increase in CO2 concentration in the top fluid, a high-dense
planar layer formed and widened rapidly at an almost constant rate.
Considering the critical Rayleigh number (Rac) as 4π2, the theoretical critical thickness of the diffusive layer
(Hc) is 9.1156 mm, and the corresponding
onset time (tc) is in the range of 2.159–6.238
min. As explained before, convection is impossible when the thickness
of the diffusive layer exceeds the critical value.23 Meanwhile, the gravitational instabilities
generated led to tiny disturbances in the diffusive layer sooner.

About half an hour later, the disturbances in the diffusive layer
gradually boosted and expanded into distinct plumes under the gravitational
instabilities.53 There was no clear demarcation
between the disturbances and plumes. The length of the frontal plumes
was measured each time (see Figure 2). The plume length increased with time in nearly linear
rather than accelerated transport.

One hour later, the convective
plumes were tightly packed with
hazy edges when Rayleigh–Taylor convections had developed spontaneously.18,50 In this step, the plumes carrying CO2 grew downward and
propagated to form many branches and lobes. Meanwhile, most branches
died away, and most lobes broke up as CO2 diffused into
the surrounding brine (see Figure 2). With the occurrence of convection, the CO2 dissolution rate will increase, and the leakage risk will decrease.10 The width of each plume is varied considerably
along the length of the plume, particularly under Rayleigh–Taylor
instability. Because Rayleigh–Taylor instability lacks good
repetition, we paid more attention to the qualitative law of gravitational
convection in the visualization experiments.

Two hours later,
the CO2-dissolved brine vertically
streamed down more stably, and the fluid with low CO2 concentration
floated to the top by gravity. The density contrast between CO2-saturated brine and initial brine is the driving force of
plume migration due to the gravitational instabilities.5 Because the density-driven convection can reduce
CO2 concentration in the gas–liquid interface,31 the dissolution rate was also enhanced considerably.33 With the broadening of the convective plumes
and the growing amount of CO2-dissolved brine filling the
bottom, the CO2 concentration at the bottom part of the
liquid was noticeably higher than other parts. The boundaries of convective
plumes at the bottom blurred gradually to obscurity first. The convective
diffusion slowly fell into a decline from bottom to top. Finally,
the convective schlieren disappeared as the gravitational convection
abated, and the image recovered to the original background.

The visualization experiments illustrated that the gravitational
convection creates a more efficient dissolving process by bringing
the fresh brine upward to the interface to touch scCO2.
The natural convection speeds up the CO2 dissolution. The
gravitational convection plays a significant and positive role in
CO2 geological storage capacity and safety.27,54

Influence of Convection on Diffusion Coefficients
Assuming
that the diffusive flux is governed by Fick’s law with the
idealized mass conservation in the PVT system, the saturated solubility
of CO2 in formation water is 5.68 × 10–4 mol/mL under the reservoir conditions (355.65 K, 20.2 MPa). The volume alterations
of the supercritical CO2 with time in the PVT system are
shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 CO2 volume changed with time during the CO2 diffusion
experiment. The actual value of CO2 volume
in the PVT experiments matches well with the ExpDec2 model,55 where Vt is the
CO2 volume at time t, t is the diffusive time, a1 and a2 are the volume coefficients of the fitting
formula, and k1 and k2 are the time coefficients of the fitting formula.

In the Fickian diffusion process,
CO2 diffuses into
brine and forms a diffusive boundary layer11 that grows in proportion to the square root of time (), where perturbations to the
stable layer
are damped.5 The relationship curve between
the mole number of CO2 dissolved in resident brines (nt) and the root of time () is drawn
in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Mole number
of CO2 dissolved in 1 L of brine against
the root of time.

The curves in Figure 4 are flatter at the
initial stage, which indicated that the diffusion
was mainly the Fickian diffusion. A study45 reported that the appearance is caused by gas compression. But the
compression has seldom affected our experiments because CO2 had been pressurized under experimental conditions before injecting.
The CO2 diffusion flux (Jt)
was dramatically enhanced at the early stage. The diffusion of CO2 was a faster process at this stage. The CO2 diffusion
coefficient decreased from a maximum of 2.3095 × 10–6 m2/s. The spontaneous convection was considered as the
main cause of the acceleration in the CO2 diffusion rate
at the beginning.18 The dissolution rate
slowed down gradually at the transitional stage. The average CO2 diffusion coefficient is 1.803 × 10–7 m2/s.

The ExpDec2 model can be applied to analyze
the data from constant-pressure
experiments also. We calculate the diffusion coefficient by fitting
pressure-decay data in Figure 3 with this model55,56 17  where k are
the coefficients of Zhao’s fitting formula56 obtained by fitting pressure-decay data.

We divide
the changes of volume into two parts (Figure 3): V1 reflects
the convective diffusion more, and V2 is
prone to reflect the molecular diffusion. V1 changed rapidly, and its contribution to diffusion reached
92.4287%. However, variation of V1 had
moderated abruptly after a dozen of hours. V2 changed placidly and sustainably. Based on eq 17, the diffusion coefficient (D2) calculated by using k2 is 1.803 × 10–7 m2/s, which
is similar to the average CO2 diffusion coefficient. The
diffusion coefficient (D1) calculated
by using k1 is 2.328 × 10–6 m2/s.

The time-dependent diffusion coefficient
was calculated by the
formula 18  

According to eqs 12 and 18, the diffusion
coefficients were calculated.18,46 The time-dependent
diffusion coefficient curves were drawn in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Time-dependent diffusion coefficient curves.

The CO2 diffusion coefficient
reached a peak of 2.282
× 10–6 m2/s rapidly in the initial
period and then dropped below the average diffusion coefficient of
1.803 × 10–7 m2/s (Figure 5). The peak diffusion coefficient
is more than D1 and less than the sum
of D1 and D2. This means that natural convection decreases with time, similar
to the density gradient.

Compared with the molecular diffusion
coefficient, the average
diffusion of CO2 in brine has improved. Apart from the
Fickian diffusion, the average diffusion coefficient of CO2 is also controlled by chemical reactions and dispersion.57Table 1 lists the diffusion coefficients of different ions calculated
on the basis of the data reported by Ellis et al.58

The saturated solubility of CO2 in brine increased with
pressure. Henry’s law indicates that the gaseous CO2 solubility is linear with respect to pressure. Upon exceeding the
critical pressure (7.383 MPa), the solubility of supercritical CO2 increased sharply with pressure. For the pressure in the
range of 14–24 MPa, the elevated pressure enhances CO2 solubility with lower increment (Table 2). This can be explained by CO2 chemical potential energy. The chemical potential48 of CO2 in the supercritical state μ(sc)
increased with pressure greater than that in the melted state μ(aq).
The Gibbs energy decreases during elevating pressure (ΔG < 0); more CO2 molecules can diffuse spontaneously
from the supercritical phase into the aqueous phase.

According
to molecular dynamics, the molecular diffusion coefficient
is proportional to the mean free path of a CO2 molecule,
which decreased with pressure (Dm ∝ P–1). For self-diffusion at different
pressures but the same temperature, the following empirical equation
has been suggested59 19  where ρg is the density of CO2, and P1 and P2 are the corresponding pressures.

The molecular
diffusion coefficient (Dm) decreases with
pressure. On the contrary, the average diffusion
coefficient (Da) increases with pressure
(Table 2).

The
density of CO2-rich brine also increases with pressure.
The CO2 dissolution increasing with pressure is a main
reason to increase the density of solution, although the volume also
changes.

The pressure affects the density-driven convection.19 According to eq 1, the Rayleigh number depends on the excess density
and diffusion coefficient, both of which are affected by pressure.
The pressure has a larger influence on CO2 solubility and
density than diffusion coefficient at the reservoir conditions. Thus,
the excess density increases with pressure to enhance the proneness
to form gravitational convection.

Because of the reservoir
pressure above the critical pressure of
CO2 (7.383 MPa), the CO2 in liquid will be converted
into the supercritical state when the temperature is beyond the critical
point (304.21 K). For CO2 in liquid, the saturated solubility
in brine decreases with temperature. Because the Gibbs energy (G) increases with temperature (eq 18), dissolution reaches equilibrium earlier
under higher temperature. For CO2 in the supercritical
state, the saturated solubility turns from decreasing to increasing
with temperature, which is similar to the variation tendency of volumetric
factor.

According to molecular dynamics, the molecular diffusion
coefficient
increases with temperature as Dm ∝ T3/2. The average diffusion coefficient also
increases with temperature (Table 3) because all the diffusion coefficients of different
ions increase with temperature.

The Rayleigh number depends
on the excess density and diffusion
coefficient, which are both affected by temperature. The temperature
has a larger influence on diffusion coefficient than the density difference
between CO2 solution and brine at the reservoir conditions.
Thus, the diffusion coefficient increases with temperature to enhance
the proneness to form gravitational convection.

Further Discussion
in Numerical Simulation
This study
has been applied to evaluate and predict the productivity of CO2 flooding and the carbon storage in a Chinese oilfield. After
long-term water flooding in this oilfield, the residual oil saturation
was 30–35%, the water cut had already reached 98%, and the
total recovery percentage had reached 51.52%, which was 99.46% of
water flooding recoverable reserves in 2009. The CO2 flooding
has come into the phase of industrialized application since 2010 after
its field experiment for 2 years. The CO2 flooding was
mainly conducted by crestal injection.

A precise reservoir geological
modeling60 was set up and applied (see Figure 6a,b). During the
reservoir numerical simulation, a convective diffusion model was built
based on our result and used to simulate the CO2 diffusion
in brine. The CO2 diffusion in oil was simulated with a
multicomponent diffusion model. Compared with traditional diffusion
model, this model can result in dissolved CO2 that tends
to diffuse toward the bottom caused by gravitational convection, which
has been proved by CO2 production data (see Figure 6c,d).

Conclusions
Visualized
experiments with a Hele-Shaw cell were performed to
study the gravitational instabilities and their effect on diffusion
rate. The disturbances in the diffusive layer gradually boosted and
expanded into convection under the gravitational instabilities. The
convective currents triggered by density gradient remarkably enhanced
the CO2 dissolution rate. The density-driven convection
further enhances the geological trapping potential. The quantitative
experiments in a PVT cell were conducted to investigate the effect
of density-driven convection on CO2 diffusion coefficient
by the constant-pressure method. The results demonstrate that the
CO2 diffusion coefficient peaks at early times via the
natural convection and higher than the molecular diffusion coefficient.
The CO2 diffusion coefficient was then reduced to approach
the average diffusion coefficient with time, which means that the
natural convection decreases with time, similar to the density gradient.
The PVT experiments were carried out at the temperatures of 293.15–423.15
K and pressures of 14–24 MPa to quantitatively test the influence
of temperature or pressure. The results imply that the Rayleigh number
increases with pressure and the onset time decreases with pressure.
The pressure has a larger influence on CO2 solubility and
density than diffusion coefficient at the reservoir conditions. Thus,
the excess density increases with pressure to enhance the proneness
to form gravitational convection. The temperature has a larger influence
on the diffusion coefficient than the density difference between CO2 solution and brine at the reservoir conditions. Thus, the
diffusion coefficient increases with temperature to enhance the proneness
to form gravitational convection. Therefore, the gravitational convection
is more likely to occur under greater pressure or higher temperature.

Visualization Experiments
To better understand the
gravitational instabilities and convective instabilities, visualization
experiments were conducted in a Hele-Shaw cell at reservoir conditions.32 The convective behavior in the Hele-Shaw cell
is governed by the same law as in porous media.

Experimental
Apparatus
A vertically oriented Hele-Shaw
cell apparatus, rated to 70 MPa and 473.15 K, was designed independently
to study the diffusion and convection characteristics of CO2 qualitatively (in Figure 7). Similar to the microvisualization experiment apparatus,61 the Hele-Shaw cell apparatus consists of flat
quartz models, a high-pressure holder, flow system, and image acquisition
and analysis system. The models with a size of 8 cm × 8 cm ×
4 mm have interior rectangular chambers with a size of 4 cm ×
4 cm and cell aperture thickness (b) of 0.2 mm. For
the Hele-Shaw model with uniform aperture thickness, the Rayleigh
number (Ra) is 173.23, and the corresponding permeability (K) is 3333 μm2 under the reservoir conditions
(355.65 K, 20.2 MPa). The model remains vertical in the gravity field
and is fitted rigidly in the pressure holder under surrounding pressure
created by injecting deionized water. The model has a top outlet and
bottom outlet to connect with the pressure holder. The injecting pressure,
surrounding pressure, and back pressure were generated and controlled
with Quizix pumps within ±0.01 kPa. The temperature of the cell
was measured with a calibrated thermocouple and controlled by an electric
heating system within ±0.01 K. The pressure holder has sapphire
windows for visualization. The images are taken with a transmitted
light image acquisition system composed of a Phantom Miro-M320S camera,
microscope, LED light tablet, relative analysis software, etc. The
image acquisition and analysis system is capable of recording 1320
frames per second (fps) at its resolution of 1920 × 1200 pixels.61

Experimental Procedure
After vacuuming
the whole system,
the pressure holder was filled with deionized water, and the Hele-Shaw
cell was filled with formation water from the bottom outlet. Before
each measurement, the entire system had been heated to formation temperature
(355.65 K). We injected CO2 into the Hele-Shaw cell from
the top outlet to form a CO2–water interface at
the upper of the model and discharged formation water from the bottom
outlet back into the brine container. The camera was adjusted to keep
the upper boundary of the visual area to coincide with the gas–water
interface. The surrounding pressure and model pressure were pressurized
to formation pressure (20.2 MPa) and remained constant with the Quizix
pumps. Based on the advanced refraction imaging technique,39 the CO2 convection images were taken
with the transmitted light imaging system. The CO2 concentration
images of high accuracy and resolution were inferred from transmitted
light intensity according to the micro-schlieren technique.

Quantitative
PVT Experiments
Experimental Apparatus
We used a
PVT apparatus (Core
Laboratories S.T., USA) to study the characteristics of CO2 dissolution and diffusion in formation water at temperatures of
293.15–423.15 K and pressures of 14–24 MPa. The apparatus
is illustrated in Figure 8. The PVT cell has a total sample volume of 240 mL and is
rated to 150 MPa and 473.15 K.62 A visible
sapphire window was attached to the front of the cell to obtain full
visibility of all the contents, and a magnetic stirrer was equipped
on the other side of the cell. The pressure generated with an automatic
pump was tested with pressure sensors and controlled with a pressure
regulator (CPS) within ±10 kPa. The temperature of the PVT cell
was measured by using a calibrated thermocouple and controlled with
an electric heating system within ±0.01 K. The volume of the
gaseous phase in the PVT cell was measured with a camera-based measurement
system (CCD) with the accuracy of 0.0001 mL. We used a GAS 4000 gasometer
(Core Laboratories S.T., USA) with 0.001 mL resolution to accurately
measure the gas volume at atmospheric pressure.

apparatus.

Experimental Procedure
For quantitative analysis of
the CO2 diffusion, the diffusion of CO2 in resident
brines is tested with the constant-pressure method to provide more
accurate (within 0.01%62) results by taking
into account the liquid phase swelling4 and unaffected by CO2 compression.47 For the constant-pressure method, the diffusion coefficient
is calculated by the changes in volume recorded during CO2 dissolution and diffusion at constant temperature and pressure.63−66

Before starting, a leakage test with nitrogen gas was done
to ensure that there is no leakage in the system. The formation water
and CO2 were heated to experimental temperature and pressurized
to experimental pressure. After vacuuming the system’s inner
space, a given volume of formation water sample was pressurized into
the vertical PVT cell under experimental pressure. Meanwhile, the
cell was loaded with the same pumping speed. A sufficient amount of
CO2 was then injected into the PVT cell under experimental
conditions. After stopping CO2 from drawing in, the carried
pressure remained constant via the precision pressure regulator. The
volume (V) of the cell was measured with CCD system
and continuously recorded.62 Some gas phase
samples were taken from a top valve with a vacuumed 1 mL flash separator
tank (FST). After the tank with the sample was cooled in the water
bath, the gas volume at atmospheric pressure was measured with the
gasometer for calculating the compressibility factor (Zt). The gasometer was connected to a gas chromatography
spectrometer (Waters, USA) for measuring CO2 volume concentration
in gas (ct). The diffusion experiment
was maintained until the system had reached a thermodynamic equilibrium,
as indicated by the volume. Some liquid phase samples were taken from
a bottom valve and slowly charged into a vacuumed FST. During the
charging process, a needle backpressure valve (with a dead volume
of 0.178 mL) was used to avoid pressure decrease. The charged liquid
sample (M) was weighted using a precision balance
(Mettler Toledo, USA) with an accuracy of 0.001 g for calculating
the density (ρ). After cooling in the water bath, the gas volume
(Vs0) was measured with the gasometer
at atmospheric pressure. The CO2 concentration in evolved
gases (ct′) was
measured with the gas chromatography spectrometer (Waters, USA).
