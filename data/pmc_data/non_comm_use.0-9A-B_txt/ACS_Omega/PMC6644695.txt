The
epoxy monolith with a highly porous structure is fabricated
by the thermal curing of 2,2-bis(4-glycidyloxyphenyl)propane and 4,4′-methylenebis(cyclohexylamine)
in the presence of poly(ethylene glycol) as the porogen via polymerization-induced
phase separation. In this study, we demonstrated a new type of dissimilar
material bonding method for various polymers and metals coated with
the epoxy monolith. On the basis of scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
observations, the pore size and number of epoxy monoliths were evaluated
to be 1.1–114 μm and 8.7–48 200 mm–2, respectively, depending on the ratio of the epoxy
resin and cross-linking agent used for the monolith fabrication. Various
kinds of thermoplastics, such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyoxymethylene,
acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene copolymer, polycarbonate
bisphenol-A, and poly(ethylene terephthalate), were bonded to the
monolith-modified metal plates by thermal welding. The bond strength
for the single lap-shear tensile test of stainless steel and copper
plates with the thermoplastics was in the range of 1.2–7.5
MPa, which was greater than the bond strength value for each bonding
system without monolith modification. The SEM observation of fractured
test pieces directly confirmed an anchor effect on this bonding system.
The elongated deformation of the plastics that filled in the pores
of the epoxy monolith, was observed. It was concluded that the bond
strength significantly depended on the intrinsic strength of the used
thermoplastics. The epoxy monolith bonding of hard plastics, such
as polystyrene and poly(methyl methacrylate), was performed by the
additional use of adhesives, solvents, and a reactive monomer. The
epoxy monolith sheets were also successfully fabricated and applied
to dissimilar material bonding.

Introduction
Monoliths are highly
porous materials with a three-dimensionally
continuous through-hole and mesh skeleton, i.e., a bicontinuous structure.1−4 The high porosity and the strength of monoliths have been applied
to the separation and support materials, such as column fillers for
high-performance liquid chromatography, catalytic supports, and columnar
reactors.5−9 In general, monoliths are formed through any microphase separation
processes, which can be categorized into polymerization-induced phase
separation (PIPS),10,11 non-solvent-induced phase separation,12,13 and thermally induced phase separation.14,15 Polymer monoliths are advantageous, unlike inorganic monoliths,
because of their pH stability, easy functionalization, and modification.
Epoxy monolith is one of the bicontinuous and porous materials formed
by PIPS. The phase separation is induced by spinodal decomposition
when an epoxy resin and a cross-linking agent are cured upon heating
in the presence of a porogen.16−23 The phase-separated structure of the epoxy resin is fixed by cross-linking
reactions. Therefore, the rate of the cross-linking reactions significantly
influences the pore size of the resulting monoliths.16,17

Recently, metal components used in the automotive, aerospace,
and
microelectronics industries are increasingly replaced by polymer and
composite materials.24−28 At the same time, the importance of adhesives and adhesion technology
has increased due to the diversity of used materials.29−35 This accelerating trend requires a new reliable technology, including
surface modification methods for dissimilar materials bonding.36−50 In contrast to the intensive studies of epoxy monoliths as column
fillers and separators for high-performance separation systems,51−65 we can find no report regarding the application of epoxy monolith
for adhesion in the literature. Our preliminary results revealed that
epoxy monolith was available for bonding of a stainless steel (SUS430)
plate and thermoplastics.66,67 In this study, we demonstrate
the validity of the epoxy monolith bonding for dissimilar material
bonding between various metals and polymers. The bonding strength
values were evaluated for polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyoxymethylene
(POM), and acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene copolymer
(ABS), polycarbonate (PC) bisphenol-A and poly(ethylene terephthalate)
(PET) as the thermoplastics with steel, copper (Cu), and aluminum
(Al) as the metals by a single lap-shear tensile test. In addition,
epoxy monolith bonding with hard plastics, such as polystyrene (PS)
and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), using commercial adhesives,
solvents, and a polyfunctional monomer was examined. Epoxy monolith
sheets were also successfully fabricated and used as the mediator
for the dissimilar material bonding.

Results and Discussion
Preparation
of Epoxy Monolith
The epoxy monolith was
prepared on the surface of metal plates using 2,2-bis(4-glycidyloxyphenyl)propane
(BADGE) and 4,4′-methylenebis(cyclohexylamine) (BACM) as the
epoxy resin and the cross-linking agent, respectively, in the presence
of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG200, Mn =
200) as the porogen (Figure 1). Thermal curing was carried out at 120 °C for 20 min,
followed by removal of the porogen with ultrasonic water and subsequent
drying. The porous structure of the epoxy monoliths was characterized
by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations. The formation
of continuous and highly porous structures of the monolith was confirmed
by evaluation of the specific surface area (approximately 0.6 m2/g) using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method.67

monolith.

Figure 2 shows the
SEM images observed for the surfaces of the epoxy monoliths, which
were prepared under the conditions of different γ values, i.e.,
the ratio of the number of reacting amino hydrogens to an epoxy group. Table 1 summarizes the results
of the evaluation of the porous structures of the epoxy monoliths
prepared under the various conditions. The diameter and number of
pores varied in the range of 1.1–114 μm and 8.7–48 200
mm–2, respectively, depending on the γ values
(γ = 0.6–1.8). For the epoxy cured under the conditions
with a γ value less than 0.4, accurate pore size and number
were not determined because of the formation of too small pores. The
SEM images of the cross section of the monolith layer (Figure 3) confirmed a continuous pore
structure inside the entire epoxy monolith except for a skin layer
attached to the metal plate. The thickness of the skin layer was less
than several micrometers.

As shown in Table 1 and Figure 4, the
number of pores per unit area decreased and the pore diameter increased
with an increase in the γ value. In contrast to the meaningful
variation of the γ values for control of the pore size and number,
the ω value (the total weight fraction of BADGE and BACM) was
limited around 0.3. Although tough and porous monoliths were successfully
produced during the reactions under the conditions of ω = 0.30
and 0.325, the monoliths obtained with an ω value less than
0.3 (for example, ω = 0.25 and 0.275) were separated from a
steel plate during ultrasonic irradiation for removal of the PEG after
the curing reaction, as shown in Table 1. The existence of large pores in the monolith probably
led to decreases in the toughness of the monolith itself and the bond
strength between the steel plate and the monolith layer. The larger
ω conditions resulted in the formation of monoliths containing
smaller and fewer pores, which cannot be used as the bonding mediator
in this study. These results agreed well with the experimental results
for the preparation of epoxy monoliths used as the column fillers
previously reported by Tsujioka et al.17 They reported that the size and number of pores depended on the
reaction conditions for the epoxy monolith fabrication, such as the
ratio of the number of amino hydrogens and epoxy groups, the amount
of the porogen, and the curing temperature. The control of the pore
size depending on the γ value can be accounted for by the competitive
reactions occurring during the epoxy curing process using amines as
the cross-linker. The epoxy monolith skeleton with a bicontinuous
structure is constructed by spinodal decomposition, whereas microparticles
are produced via a nuclear growth mechanism under the metastable conditions.17 Because of sequential changes in the curing
reaction conditions, some particles also formed in the cavity of the
epoxy monolith, as seen in the SEM images. It is assumed that such
particle formation may not give adverse effects for monolith bonding.

monoliths. γ = 2[NH2]/[epoxy].

We evaluated the rates of two reactions for the epoxy curing,
i.e.,
the polymer-chain extension and the cross-linking by the reaction
of an epoxy group with primary and secondary amines. Typical reactions
included in the curing process of an epoxy resin using an amine cross-linker
are shown in Scheme 1. It has been reported that the reactions of an epoxy moiety with
amino groups proceed prior to the reaction with a hydroxy group and
that the reaction rate of a primary amine is much higher than that
of the secondary one.68−70Figure 5 shows the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves for the
epoxy monolith fabrication systems with different γ values.
Dual exothermic peaks were observed for the curing systems in this
study, except for the system with γ = 1.4, in which only a single
exothermic peak was detected. The first peak was assigned as the exothermic
event due to the opening of an epoxy group by the primary amine (−R–NH2), as shown in eq 1 in Scheme 1, and the second one was due to the formation of a
cross-linking point by the reaction between a residual epoxy group
and the secondary amine (−R–NH–R) produced by
the ring opening during the first step (eq 2 in Scheme 1). An excess amount of amine accelerates
the chain growth of the primary epoxy resins rather than the formation
of cross-linking points. It results in the promotion of the phase
separation because of an increase in the molecular weight of the epoxy
resins. However, the use of a smaller amount of amine led to the preferential
formation of a network structure because of the fast consumption of
the primary amines. The observed DSC exothermic curves in Figure 5 were quantitatively
analyzed. As summarized in Table 2, the ratio of the enthalpies for the first- and second-step
reactions, i.e., the ΔH1/ΔH2 values increased with an increase in the γ
value. The ΔH1/ΔH2 values were 82/18, 85/15, and 90/10 for the systems
of γ = 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0, respectively. Thus, it was revealed
that the pore size was determined by the competitive reactions of
the epoxy group with the primary and secondary amines.

Metal/Plastic Bond Strength
We determined bond strength
for the bonding systems composed of steel, Cu, and Al plates modified
with the epoxy monolith and various plastic plates. The bond strength
values evaluated by a single lap-shear tensile test are summarized
in Figure 6. The maximum
bond strength approximately decreased in the order of PC, PET, ABS,
and the other plastics. In the bonding systems using steel and Cu,
failure events occurred at an interface between the monolith surface
and the plastics and the bond strength significantly depended on the
properties of the used plastics. This was because the mechanical stress
was concentrated at the interface between the monolith and plastics
when a shear force was applied. Consequently, the mechanical strength
of the plastics determined the total performance of each monolith
bonding system. The plastic deformation due to the stress concentration
was directly confirmed by the SEM images of the fracture surfaces
for both the epoxy monolith and the plastics, as discussed in the
following section.

Figure 6 Bond strength for epoxy monolith bonding between dissimilar
materials
including Al, steel, and Cu as the metals and PE, PP, POM, ABS, PET,
and PC as the thermoplastics. For detailed bonding conditions such
as thermal welding and pretreatment conditions, see Table S1 in the Supporting Information.

In contrast to the high bond strength observed for the systems
using steel and Cu plates, all the plastics exhibited a poor bonding
ability with an Al plate, as shown in the bond strength for the results
using an untreated Al plate (U) in Figure 7. In this case, failure invariably occurred
between the Al plate and the epoxy monolith layer but not between
the epoxy monolith surface and the plastics. This was due to the presence
of an aluminum oxide layer on the surface of the Al plate. In fact,
the bonding property was dramatically improved by chemical etch with
an alkaline (A) or mechanical polish using a metal file (M) or sandpaper
(S). Changes in the bond strength after the surface treatments are
shown in Figure 7.
The failure mode mostly changed to that between the epoxy monolith
surface and the plastics. The pretreatment was also valid for the
steel and Cu plates, but the magnitude of the strength improvement
was less than that for Al (Table S2). This
result indicated that the formation of the aluminum oxide layer significantly
influenced the bond strength. The bond strength values for the Al/plastic
bonding under the optimized conditions was similar to the results
using steel and Cu plates, as shown in Figure 6.

using (A) NaOH aq, (M) a metal file, and (S) sandpaper on the bond
strength for Al/plastic bonding systems. U indicates the results using
an untreated Al plate. For detailed conditions and results, see Table S2 in the Supporting Information.

Because a molten polymer is required
to penetrate into the pores
of the monolith during a thermal welding process for joint fabrication,
the thermal-welding conditions (i.e., temperature and time) were optimized
for each specimen. Figure 8a shows the bond strength values for the test pieces composed
of the steel plate and several thermoplastics under different thermal-welding
conditions. A higher welding temperature and longer welding time increased
the bond strength for each system. However, too high and too long
welding processes resulted in some damage of the plastics, leading
to a decrease in their bond strength, as shown in Figure 8b. We concluded that thermal
welding should be performed at a temperature close to the melting
point for the crystalline polymers or ca. 10–20 °C higher
than the glass transition temperature for amorphous polymers.

conditions (temperature and time) on

Mechanism of
Epoxy Monolith Bonding
Interfacial failures
between the monolith and the thermoplastics were observed for all
cases after the appropriate pretreatment of the metal surfaces. Simultaneously,
they indicated the robust interaction between the metal and the epoxy
layer. The toughness of the epoxy resin was also confirmed on the
basis of no occurrence of the cohesive failure of the epoxy monolith. Figure 9 shows SEM images
of the fracture surfaces after the single lap-shear tensile test as
well as a schematic model for the stretched deformation and fracture
of the polymers for the epoxy monolith bonding. A significant number
of elongated needle-like structures was observed on both surfaces
of the resins and the epoxy monoliths. The type of elongation of the
plastics at the ductile failure positions was dependent on the mechanical
property of the polymers. Highly stretched deformation of the debris
was observed on the fracture surfaces of the PE, PP, and POM plates,
whereas stumplike debris were detected on the surface of the ABS,
PC, and PET plates. It is noted that the direct observation of the
stretched debris out of the holes located at the monolith surfaces
undoubtedly indicates a significant anchor effect for the present
dissimilar material bonding system.

epoxy monolith on
the steel plate and the fractured thermoplastics after a single lap-shear

model for the stretched deformation and fracture of polymers for epoxy
monolith bonding, and (d) the cross section of a test specimen for
Al/PE system. It was separated from an Al plate after thermal welding
of PE at 150 °C for 60 s.

The penetration of the molten plastics into the pores of
the epoxy
monolith during the thermal-welding process was also confirmed by
SEM observations of the cross section of the specimens. Figure 9d shows the SEM image of the
cross section for a test specimen for the Al/PE bonding system. The
PE/monolith composite was separated from an Al plate after thermal
welding of PE with a monolith-modified Al plate at 150 °C for
60 s; then, it was given for SEM observation. A layer of the epoxy
monolith filled with PE was observed between the bulk PE layer and
an unfilled epoxy monolith layer. The characteristics of both the
epoxy materials with a high free energy and the thermoplastic resins
with a low free energy and high fluidity are important to easy penetration
of polymers into the monolith pores.

The penetration of thermoplastics
into the pores is a key factor
for determining the bond strength for the epoxy monolith bonding.
Therefore, the size and number of the monolith pores were expected
to have an effect on the bond strength. We checked the bond strength
values for a series of Cu/PE and Cu/POM systems prepared under the
conditions of various γ values in the range of 0.4–1.8,
which were expected to provide the epoxy monoliths with a pore size
in the range of approximately 1–102 μm and
a pore number in the range of approximately 10–105 mm–2 (see also Figure 4). The bond strength moderately depended
on the γ values, i.e., the pore size. The maximum strength was
observed for the monoliths prepared with γ = 1.4–1.6,
as shown in Figure 10. This tendency was probably caused by the release of the stress
concentration by an increase in the pore size, but a small number
of large pores may have a weaker anchor effect. The fabrication of
an epoxy monolith with the same pore size and different pore number
was difficult because a change in the ω value resulted in the
formation of fragile monolith materials, as described above (see also Table 1).

Figure 10 γ value dependence
of bond strength for (a) Cu/PE and (b)
Cu/POM bonding systems using epoxy monoliths prepared under the conditions
of various γ values.

The bond strength was actually independent of the thickness
of
the whole epoxy monolith layer. It was because the plastics were introduced
into the pores of the monolith by the thermal welding process and
the structure around the interface of the monolith and the plastics
mainly contributed to the bond strength. We also found no effect of
the surface roughness on the bond strength. The epoxy monolith surface
was gently ground with sandpaper (#320), and it was used for the single
lap-shear tensile test using Cu and PE or POM plates. As a result,
similar bond strength values were observed with or without the grinding
treatment of the monolith surfaces (see Table S2 in the Supporting Information for the detailed results).
This indicated less contribution of surface roughness to an increase
in the bond strength. This result also suggests that the continuous
pore structure of the epoxy monolith is important for the favorable
performance of the monolith bonding system in this study.

Fabrication
of Monolith Sheet
As described in the previous
sections, the epoxy monolith was useful for dissimilar material bonding
when it was coated on a metal surface. We also found the epoxy monolith
was also available as the sheet. We fabricated a self-standing monolith
sheet by the preparation of an epoxy monolith on an Al plate without
any pretreatment. After the thermal curing and the subsequent treatments
for the porogen removal, a cured thin epoxy layer was readily exfoliated
from the Al plate because of the weak interaction between the monolith
and the oxidized Al plate surface. The thickness of the monolith sheets
was varied by the amount of the reaction mixture coated on the plate.
The isolated monolith sheets were flexible and could be folded, as
shown in Figure 11. DSC measurements of the epoxy materials fabricated in this study
before and after curing indicated that the curing reaction started
from 50 °C and was approximately completed at 150 °C. No
exothermic peak was observed for the epoxy samples after curing at
120 °C for 20 min. The glass transition temperature was determined
to be 139 °C for the cured material. When we carried out a tensile
test of the monolith sheets prepared with different curing times,
the maximum strength (strength at break) and modulus increased with
an increase in the curing time and became an almost constant value
after a 90 min curing (Table 3). Finally, a 6.6 MPa fracture strength was obtained for the
sheet after a 120 min curing. The elongation value decreased from
25 to 15% along with the curing time, due to a further increase in
the cross-linking density. The modulus values was 251–394 MPa.
These material properties of the epoxy monolith were different from
those of the bulk epoxy material, of which the fracture strength,
elongation, and modulus values were 45.8 MPa, 4.6%, and 1640 MPa,
respectively, as shown in Figure 12 and Table 3. The differences in these values are due to the presence
of porosity (ca. 30% in volume) in the epoxy monolith.

Monolith Bonding
for Various Materials
The monolith
bonding technique is available for the bonding of various combinations
of materials other than the thermal-weld bonding of metals and thermoplastics.
The use of the monolith sheet and any adhesive or solvent was valid
for the bonding of materials that cannot be thermally welded. Examples
of the various types of dissimilar material bonding systems are summarized
in Table 4.

The modification
of the steel plate with the epoxy monolith increased
strength for bonding between steel and PS, in which a commercial adhesive
for plastic models or toluene was used for the welding of the epoxy
monolith and PS. The monolith sheet was similarly available for the
steel/PS bonding using two kinds of commercial adhesives appropriate
for PS and steel. The bond strength increased from 0.1 to 0.4 MPa
without monolith to 0.8–1.4 MPa with the monolith modifications.
The failure occurred at an interface of the monolith surface and PS
when the monolith was present between the steel and PS plates. For
the bonding system of steel/PMMA, the use of a monolith coating on
a steel plate combined with organic solvents as the plasticizers permitted
the bonding with a strength of 0.7–1.1 MPa. Methyl ethyl ketone
as the good solvent was more effective compared with acetone as the
theta solvent for PMMA. It was expected that the plasticized PMMA
by a good solvent more rapidly intruded into the pores of the epoxy
monolith, resulting in the higher bond strength value. It is not easy
to bond different kinds of plastic plates because the thermal-weld
conditions should be carefully selected according to the properties
of the thermoplastics. In such a case, nevertheless, it was effective
to use the stepwise combination of thermal and solvent welding processes.
We first performed the thermal welding of a PP plate with a monolith
sheet; then, the other side of the sheet was bonded to a PC plate
with toluene. The bond strength drastically increased from 0.02 to
1.5 MPa. The thermal curing of polyfunctional monomers can also be
used for the monolith bonding systems. EDMA containing a small amount
of BPO penetrated into the monolith fabricated on the steel plate
and it was bonded with a PMMA plate, followed by heating at 90 °C.
The greater bond strength (1.0–1.6 MPa) was confirmed, and
the failure occurred at the interface of the steel and the monolith.

Conclusions
In this study, we proposed a new method for
dissimilar material
bonding using the anchor effect of the epoxy monolith with a porous
structure. This method was demonstrated to be valid for the bonding
of metals, such as steel, Cu, and Al, with various thermoplastics.
By using the monolith sheet and an adhesive (or solvent), this bonding
procedure was applied to many kinds of adherends other than thermoplastics,
such as acrylic thermosets. We revealed the pore size and number of
epoxy monoliths controlled by the ratio of the epoxy resin and cross-linking
agent during the monolith fabrication and the role of an anchor effect
on this monolith bonding system by the SEM observations. Various kinds
of thermoplastics were bonded to the monolith-modified metal plates
by thermal welding with the bond strength in the range of 1.2–7.5
MPa for the single lap-shear tensile test. The epoxy monolith bonding
of hard plastics and thermosets was also performed by the additional
use of adhesives, solvents, reactive monomers, and the epoxy monolith
sheets. The features of the epoxy monolith bonding are summarized
as follows: (i) suitable for bonding between various dissimilar materials,
(ii) easy fabrication of a monolith layer on a metal by coating and
curing processes, (iii) no requirement of special chemicals for etching
and apparatus for metal surface modifications, and (iv) applicable
using adherends with various shapes. The epoxy monolith technique
would be one of the invaluable bonding methods for various adherends,
especially metal/polymer bonding. We are now continuing our investigation
using high-performance engineering plastics and their composites to
demonstrate the higher bond strength for this system.

Experimental
Section
General Procedures
SEM observations were carried out
using a Keyence VE-9800 at the acceleration voltage of 2.0–3.0
kV after Au vapor deposition of the polymer fracture surfaces and
0.8–1.0 kV without vapor deposition for the epoxy monolith
surfaces on a metal plate. DSC measurement was carried out using Shimadzu
DSC-60 at the heating rate of 10 °C/min in a nitrogen stream.
The thickness of the epoxy monolith was determined using Peacock dial
thickness Gauge (Ozaki mfg. Co., Ltd., Japan). The hot press was carried
out using an AH-2003 from AsOne Co., Japan,

Materials
BADGE,
BACM, and PEG200 were purchased from
Tokyo Chemical Industry, Co., Ltd., Japan, and used without further
purification. The purities of these chemicals were confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy. The plastic plates (thickness = 2–5
mm), SUS430, Cu, and Al plates (thickness = 0.5 mm for the metals),
were purchased from AsOne Co., Japan and cut to a size of 10 mm ×
50 mm. The commercial metal plates were cleansed with acetone and
subsequently dried. EDMA and BPO were purchased from Tokyo Chemical
Industry, Co., Ltd., Japan, and Nacalai Tesque, Japan, respectively,
and used as received. Commercial plastic model adhesive (CA-216, Cemedine
Co., Ltd., Japan) and an epoxy adhesive (Araldite AR-30, Nichiban
Co., Ltd., Japan) were used as the additional adhesives.

Preparation
of Epoxy Monolith
BADGE, BACM, and PEG200
(typically 70 wt % for PEG200) at a ratio of 2[NH2]/[epoxy]
(γ value) = 0.40–1.8 were well mixed by a planetary centrifugal
mixer (Thinky AR-100). The mixed paste was spread on a metal plate
with a determined thickness, followed by thermal curing at 120 °C
for 20–80 min. After curing, the samples were washed with ion-exchanged
water with ultrasonics to remove the PEG200, stored in ion-exchanged
water overnight, then dried in vacuo for 2 h at room temperature.
The thickness of the epoxy monolith layer was 100–400 μm
(typically ca. 200 μm). A monolith sheet was prepared according
to a similar procedure using an Al plate without any surface treatment.
The curing time was 20–120 min. The thickness of the monolith
sheet was 300–400 μm. Two monolith sheets were bonded
on each back side using a commercial epoxy adhesive and cured at room
temperature overnight, followed by further curing at 70 °C for
1 h.

Metal Surface Pretreatments
Chemical and mechanical
pretreatments of the metal plate surfaces were carried out using an
alkaline solution (A), a metal file (M), sandpaper (S), or without
any treatment (U) (see also Figure 7 and Table S2). As the chemical
etching process, a metal plate was immersed in 10% NaOH aq at room
temperature for 2.5–10 min, followed by washing with ion-exchanged
water and drying. For the mechanical pretreatment, a metal plate was
ground with a metal file or sandpaper (grain size #80) until the metal
surface showed a metallic luster, typically for 10–20 min.
The monolith surface was optionally ground with sandpaper of a smaller
grain size (#320).

Tensile Test
Test pieces for the
single lap-shear tensile
measurement were prepared under various thermal-welding conditions
of temperature and time depending on the properties of each plastic,
then softly pressed at less than 0.1 MPa. The bonding area (overlapped
area of two adherends, i.e., metals and plastic plates) was 10 mm
× 10 mm. The tensile test was carried out using a Shimadzu Autograph
AGS-X 1 kN or 5 kN at the tensile rate of 0.1 or 1.0 mm/min, according
to JIS-K6850, which corresponds to ISO4587, as the standard. The number
of test samples (N) was 3–6 for all measurements. The bond
strength values were calculated on the basis of the applied force
at break and the bonding area (100 mm2).
