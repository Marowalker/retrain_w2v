A cellular coating
based on hydrophobic interactions of an elastin-like
recombinamer (ELR) with the cell membrane is presented. It is well-documented
that biophysical properties such as net charge, hydrophobicity, and
protein-driven cell–ligand (integrin binding) interactions
influence the interaction of polymers, proteins or peptides with model
membranes and biological cells. Most studies to enhance membrane–substrate
interactions have focused on the introduction of positively charged
groups to foster electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged
membrane. Herein, we present an antagonistic approach based on ELRs
with varying amounts of hydrophobic cholesteryl groups (ELRCTAs). The ability of the membranes to stabilize cholesteryl groups
is hypothesized to assist the coordination of hydrophobic ELRs with
the membrane. The main objective was to generate a defined cellular
coating of a recombinant protein that allows for total sequence control
and less host, or batch-to-batch, variation as a substitute for the
existing coatings like alginate, polyelectrolytes, collagens, and
fibronectin. We used an in vitro cell-binding assay to quantify cell–substrate
interactions, showing enhanced cellular recognition and matrix distribution
with an increasing number of cholesteryl groups incorporated. These
novel materials and the versatile nature of their protein sequence
have great potential as cellular markers, drug carriers, or hydrophobic
cell-binding domains.

Introduction
Modification
of the cellular surface with natural or synthetic
polymers allows for new opportunities in tissue regeneration and biomedical
engineering. As such, control of the cellular microenvironment has
become an important tool for controlling cell growth, cell–cell
interactions, cytokine expression, stem cell differentiation, and
extracellular assembly. The patterning and chemical modification of
the surfaces,1−3 the expansion into three-dimensional (3D) by using
biomimetic or natural hydrogels,4−6 or layer-by-layer (LbL) assemblies
onto the cells are the focus of the current research.7−11 Generally, substrates are bound to the cell membrane via covalent
conjugation, hydrogen bonding, and electrostatic, dipole–dipole,
or hydrophobic interactions. When mimicking the natural interaction
of materials with cells, three key events need to be considered: (1)
the composition of the material, (2) cell–membrane interactions,
and (3) the composition of the cell membrane itself.

The membrane
bilayer is a physical barrier that defines the frontier
of the cells and segregates the interior into distinct compartments
with specialized functions. The amphiphilic nature of the membrane
leads to a negatively charged outer surface and a hydrophobic core
inside the membrane, which serves as an anchor for membrane and transmembrane
proteins. Consequently, cells have the ability to bind substrates
via integrin binding, electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonds,
or hydrophobic interactions. Moreover, the membrane contains a variety
of compounds and proteins that are crucial for cellular function.
One of the most abundant molecules in the membrane is cholesterol,
which is found inside the membrane due to its hydrophobicity. Cholesterol
is responsible for membrane integrity and cell signaling and accounts
for up to 20% of the membrane’s mass.12 Cholesterol, among the many lipid constituents of mammalian cell
membranes, is a key regulator of membrane fluidity and contributes
to the formation of caveolae, and in maintaining caveolae microdomain.13,14 Caveolae are specialized domains of the plasma membrane that are
found in most cell types.15 However, they
are more abundant in cells like adipocytes, endothelial cells, fibroblasts,
and muscle cells.16 In addition to the
influence of membrane fluidity, cholesterol is important for cell
structure and function, it is essential in locomotion and serves as
a metabolic precursor for several signaling molecules, including oxysterols,17 steroids,18 and bile
acids.14,19,20

The
majority of substrates or hydrogels focus on integrin binding
sites, in particular the RGD binding site, to generate cell binding,
or infiltration. Synthetic materials with covalently bound RGD residues
nevertheless struggle to meet the results of native extracellular
matrix (ECM) protein materials.21 Other
research for the fabrication of 3D-tissue constructs has focused on
cell sheet engineering,22 magnetic liposomes,23 cell beads,24 and
cells containing gel layers.25−27 In particular, the creation of
cell type specific and target tissue specific nano- and microdomains
using biological interactions, such as avidin–biotin,28−31 antibody–antigen,32,33 lectin–polysaccharides,34,35 or ECM proteins like fibronectin, collagen and/or gelatin,25,26,36−40 has shown promising results in “hierarchical-cell
manipulation” in vitro.9,10,36,39

In this approach, a cell
coating based on hydrophobic interactions
with the cell membrane is presented. To reduce the batch-to-batch
and other host-specific variations of organism-derived proteins, an
ECM analogue elastin-like recombinamer (ELR) is used as a model protein
for the tissue-inductive coating. The main objective is the creation
of a well-distributed initial layer of protein on the cells. As such,
the potential of hydrophobic groups as intramembranous anchors for
cellular coatings is determined. Cholesteryl side groups were selected
as hydrophobic anchors to mimic the intramembranous situation and
to facilitate the mobility and distribution of the proteins in the
membrane. For better interaction of the cholesterol material with
the membrane, caveolin-rich cell types like human umbilical vein endothelium-derived
cells (HUVEC) and human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMC), which
are involved in lipid uptake from sanguine fluid and in processes
such as stenosis, were selected.16

Results
Modification of the ELR with the BCN linker, fluorophore, and CTA
groups was successfully performed by a two-step synthesis (Scheme 1). The number of
incorporations was followed by NMR spectroscopy, and the results are
displayed in Table 1 (complete NMR spectra can be found in the Supporting Information).

The hydrodynamic radii
of ELRCTA in a phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) was determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS). However,
as the multimodality of the sample above the lower critical solution
temperature (LCST) did not allow for size-average comparison, the
volume intensities were plotted (Figure 1). Moreover, volume intensities allow for
small particle detection in a complex precipitating sample. All of
the samples have similar size at 4 °C, ranging between 3 and
7 nm, which corresponds to 2–10 ELR molecules according to
the size–mass calibration. An additional population of 2 nm
particles, which might correspond to unimers is observed in CTA5.
Above the LCST, CTA0 agglomerates into larger structures and precipitates
from solution, starting with 30 nm particles and larger micrometer-sized
populations in the initial stage of precipitation. Upon cholesteryl
addition, a significant shift toward smaller particles is observed
above the LCST in the volume intensities, as well confirmed by a left
shift of the correlation function (Figure 2). Addition of more CTA groups leads to a
reduction in the number of larger particles, which is most prominent
in CTA5, similar to conditions below the LCST. The cloud point of
the samples was determined as the derivative of the absorbance versus
temperature profile of ELRCTA. A significant increase in
turbidity and related absorbance was only observed in CTA0, which
was already drastically reduced in CTA1, with a transition temperature
(Tt) of 23.9 and 26.0 °C and a maximum
absorbance of 1.6 and 0.3, respectively. No changes in absorbance
were observed for CTA3 and CTA5 in the temperature range 5–40
°C (Figure 3),
which is in accordance with the decrease in the number of larger agglomerates
observed by DLS.

The different substrates were
tested for their effect on cell proliferation
over 7 days using the alamarBlue assay at the concentrations of 375
and 750 nM. The values were normalized to nonconditioned cells grown
on tissue-culture polystyrene (TCPS) for better visibility. The HUVECs
showed no significant differences in proliferation under all conditions
(Figure 4A), whereas
for HASMCs, treatment with cholesteryl ELRs (ELRCTA) at
750 nM led to a decreased proliferation for CTA0 and CTA1 at day 1
and for all conditioned samples at day 3 and 7, which became more
significant with time (Figure 4B). Moreover, the cytostatic effect is more pronounced in
CTA0 and CTA1 on days 1 and 7. The lower concentration (375 nM) had
no negative effect on proliferation.

0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001).

All subsequent incubation studies
were performed at concentrations
of 375 nM as proliferation of both cell lines was unaffected at this
concentration. The cell–ELR interaction was quantified by FACS,
with the number of fluorescent events increasing from CTA0 to CTA5,
as indicated by a right shift in the dot plots from 10 to 80% (HUVEC),
or from 20 to 85% (HASMC), fluorescent cells (Figure 5A–E; HASMC dot plots are provided
as Supporting Information). The HASMC cells
interact with the material to a higher extent at low cholesteryl contents,
increasing from 20 to 60% from CTA0 to CTA3, whereas the coating efficiency
of these ELRs remains below 30% with the HUVEC cells (Figure 5F).

HUVEC and HASMC cells. See the Supporting Information for the HASMC dot plots. P values refer to the
cells treated with CTA0 (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01).

Confocal images of trypsinized cells after incubation revealed
a change in the ELR distribution on the cell membrane that is dependent
on the cholesteryl content, ranging from more agglomerated micron-sized
particles to finely dispersed sub-micron dots, with this being found
for both cell lines (Figure 6). Additionally, a Z-scan was performed for the sample with
dispersed fluorescence to determine the fluorescence distribution.
The localized presence of ELRCTA in the cell center (first
five layers), followed by depletion of fluorescence in the center
(subsequent layers), indicates binding of ELR to the membrane (Figure 7). Live cell imaging
further revealed an increased aggregation of bound ELRs in HASMC (CTA0
and CTA1) and an increased dispersion of ELR in both HUVEC and HASMC
(CTA5) (results are shown in the right part of Figure 8, and in the Supporting Information).

ELR fluorescence in the top image covers most of the cell surface,
whereas in the lower slices, the ELR is more concentrated at the perimeter

Discussion
Several studies concerning polymer–membrane
interactions
and internalization have been published in recent years.26,41 Indeed, it is well-documented that biophysical properties such as
net charge, hydrophobicity, and protein-driven cell–ligand
(integrin binding) interactions influence the interaction of polymers,
proteins, or peptides with model membranes and biological cells.42 Most polymer modifications have focussed on
the introduction of a positive charge to foster electrostatic interactions
with the membrane (polycations),26 or on
the insertion of integrin-binding domains (like RGD).41 Since integrin-binding amino acid sequences frequently
contain charged residues, both these approaches increase the net charge
and hydrophilicity of the material. The basis for this study was an
antagonistic approach that makes use of a set of carefully designed
ELRs of varying hydrophobicities to trigger membrane–substrate
interactions. For the introduction of hydrophobic moieties, a strategy
of postexpressional modification with cholesteryl groups was used
to keep other peptide properties, such as peptide charge and charge
distribution, unchanged. Cholesteryl groups were selected as cell-anchor
moieties due to the abundance and importance of cholesterol in the
cell structure, function, and locomotion; furthermore, the ability
of membranes to stabilize cholesteryl groups is thought to assist
the coordination of hydrophobic ELRs to the membrane. The main objective
was to generate a defined cellular coating of a recombinant protein
that allows for total sequence control and less host or batch-to-batch
variation as a substitute for the existing coatings such as alginate,25 polyelectrolytes,26 collagens, and fibronectin.38−40

An in vitro cell-binding
assay was used to quantify cell–membrane
interactions. Thus, HUVEC and HASMC were incubated with molecular
probes of varying cholesteryl concentrations (Figure 1). At 37 °C, ELRCTA0 and
ELRCTA are above their LCST of 23.9 and 26 °C, respectively
(Figure 3); therefore,
precipitation and hydrophobic ELR–ELR interactions are more
favored, and agglomeration occurs. This agglomeration can be prevented
upon the introduction of cholesteryl side chains, which hamper the
aggregation and lead to the disappearance of the LCST transition.
Although more hydrophobic, the agglomeration of ELRCTA was
not observed. For a better understanding of LCST disappearance in
CTA samples, the CD spectra were recorded at 37 °C, which showed
a slight decrease of random coil signal at 197 nm upon cholesteryl
addition, indicating an increased order toward β-turn43 and α helical structures,44 which is consistent with studies on cholesteryl-modified
polylysine.45 Nevertheless, besides slightly
augmented order, overall spectra were quite similar (data shown in
the Supporting Information) and give no
explanation on diminished precipitation. Consequently, we assume that
cholesteryl is destabilizing micelles in ionic solutions such as PBS,
thereby forcing the ELRs to form monomers, which, given their size,
are nonabsorbent even above the LCST. Furthermore, the probes with
higher amounts of cholesterol showed a significant increase in ELR
binding to the cell membrane as hydrophobic interactions with the
membrane lead to a better distribution of the material in the membrane.
It is believed that the abundance of cholesterol in the cell membrane
and its hydrophobic nature further foster the cell–ELRCTA interaction. The hypothesized mechanism of cellular ELR
association relates to the cholesterol content (Figure 8). Thus, in the absence of cholesteryl groups,
the ELR agglomerates over time to form micron-sized particles as a
result of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions (Figure 8; further images and video
are shown in the Supporting Information), whereas increasing numbers of cholesteryl groups lead to a weakening
of the ELRCTA–ELRCTA interaction and
to an increased ELR–membrane interaction under physiological
conditions, thus resulting in the distribution of the ELR in the cell
membrane.    Live cell
imaging of all cell types supported
the hypothesis whereby the larger agglomerates, which bind to the
cell membranes, are still mobile and tend to bind to each other upon
contact. High cholesteryl contents led to ELRs being very finely dispersed
throughout the membrane. The marked mobility of the ELRCTAs in the cell membrane (see the Supporting Information) indicates that the interaction with the membrane does not reduce
cell mobility. Moreover, the HUVEC cells did not interact with ELRs
CTA < 3 and the agglomerated ELR, with these ELRs binding to the
well-plate and their organization remaining unchanged over time. In
contrast, in the HASMC cells, the ELR fragments adhere to the membrane
and are moved around by the cells, thus resulting in growth of the
agglomerates as a result of an increased probability for ELR–ELR
contacts. The increased membrane affinity for cholesteryl groups overcomes
the ELR–ELR interaction, thus resulting in more dispersed particles
in solution as well as on the membrane and increasing the number of
fluorescent-positive cells. The HASMCs are less selective than HUVECs
and actively bind low-cholesteryl ELRs, with the amount of bound ELR
per cell appearing to be higher, as characterized by a second population
of right-shifted cells with a fluorescent intensity of 102–103. However, the tendency of ELRCTA to be dispersed was observed in both cell lines. The distribution
of the ELRs is shown in detail in the confocal images, which show
how the ELR agglomerates of CTA0 or CTA1 are bound to the membrane
as micrometer-sized particles, changing with increasing cholesterol
content into a myriad of submicron-sized small ELR dots within the
membrane. Confocal imaging also supports the fact that most of the
ELR remains in close proximity to the membrane; nonetheless, incorporation
into the cells cannot be fully excluded. In light of the data obtained
from flow cytometry, the incorporation of ELRs into the membrane,
or the association of ELR with the membranes, does not negatively
affect cell proliferation, as would be indicated by an increased amount
of cell debris in ungated dot plots (Supporting Information).

Although elastin-like proteins (ELPs, also
referred to as ELRs)
with a similar constitution to CTA0 presented herein have been reported
to be tunable in terms of membrane interactions due to changes in
temperature, thereby resulting in changes of hydrophobicity and the
good interaction of CTA0 (T > Tt) with HASMC cells, it should be noted that much lower
concentrations
were used in our work.41 Simnick et al.
further showed that integrin receptor-like interactions could be used
to further increase cell–ligand interactions.41 The augmented affinity to cell membranes with cholesteryl
anchors was further reported with modified hyaluronan,46 or DNA.47 The differences
in CTA groups on cellular uptake might be explained by the involvement
of cells in lipid uptake. Cholesterol can interact with other proteins
via both covalent48 and noncovalent mechanisms,49,50 thereby regulating protein stability, localization,51 and activity.20 Cholesterol
accumulation is one of the primary events in atherosclerosis within
specific and specialized cell types such as SMCs, where it results
in uncontrolled uptake, whereas endothelial cells maintain tight cholesterol
homeostasis,52 which might explain the
selectivity of HUVECs for high ELRCTA concentrations. Furthermore,
it has been shown that, in contrast to SMCs, endothelial cells do
not undergo the foam cell phenotypic change in atherosclerotic plaques,
a change characterized by the unrestricted accumulation of cellular
cholesterol,53 which would explain the
cytostatis of HASMC at 750 nM ELRCTA. It should be noted
that CTA0 and CTA1 have a more cytostatic effect on HASMCs, which,
in turn, means that cholesteryl groups improve the cytocompatibility
of CTA0. Although the interaction of CTA0 and CTA1 with cells is possibly
mediated by electrostatic interactions with the remaining free lysines
of the ELR, this interaction is not strong enough to disrupt the hydrophobic
ELR–ELR interaction above the LCST, thus resulting in the growth
of bound aggregates over time.

Conclusions
The general mechanisms
of cell–substrate binding are based
on integrin–substrate binding, or polycation LbL coatings,
and phagocytosis of positively charged polyplexes. However, this work
provides an additional cue by using hydrophobic entities as mediators
of cell–substrate interactions. In this work, cholesterol groups
are used as a cellular anchor to enhance the membrane substrate interaction
of an elastin-like recombinamer (ELR). The resulting materials showed
enhanced cellular recognition and matrix distribution, in line with
the number of CTA groups incorporated.

To the best of our knowledge,
hydrophobic moieties that function
as cellular membrane anchors for proteins have not yet been investigated
to date. Since no negative proliferative effect on cells was observed
in selected cell types at concentrations resulting in >60% of fluorescently
labeled cells, the present system may lead to a better understanding
of hydrophobic membrane–substrate interactions and the development
of novel hydrophobicity-driven cell coatings that could potentially
replace current coatings. Furthermore, these novel materials and their
versatility in terms of protein sequence have high potential as cellular
markers, drug carriers, or hydrophobic cell-binding domains. The cell
specificity also allows for further optimization of the process by
varying concentrations, incubation times and the number of cholesteryl
groups. This system may also help to understand the mechanisms by
which vascular endothelial cells maintain tight cholesterol homeostasis
and may shed light on the mechanisms of cellular sterol transport,
or high-density lipoprotein-dependent RCT. Future studies will focus
on ELR–cholesteryl systems with fewer ELR–ELR attractions
at 37 °C to extract the driving force of membrane distribution
and the related contribution of cholesteryl groups, or the ELRs themselves.

Materials
and Methods
Synthesis
The genetic construction of the ELRs used
in this work, which were bioproduced and supplied by Technical Proteins
Nanobiotechnology, S.L. (TPNBT, S.L., Spain), was performed according
to Rodríguez-Cabello et al., 2012.54 In brief, the ELR sequence (MESLLP VG VPGVG [VPGKG(VPGVG)5]23 VPGKG VPGVG VPGVG VPGVG VPGV) was genetically designed
and produced in Escherichia coli. Purification
was carried out using alternating precipitation and resolvation cycles,
induced by response of the LCST of the ELR upon heating and cooling
(inverse temperature cycling), followed by dialysis (12 000
MWCO—Medicell Membranes Ltd., Liverpool) and sterile filtration
(0.22 μm; Nalgene). The sterile product was freeze-dried and
stored at −20 °C until further use.

Chemical Functionalization
of ELR VKV with BCN N-Hydroxysuccinimide Ester [1]
BCN moieties
were introduced by amidation of the free lysines (K) present in the
ELR backbone, using the N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)
esters of the active compound (1R,8S,9S)-bicyclo[6.1.0]non-4-yn-9-ylmethyl N-succinimidyl carbonate (BCN–NHS; Synaffix, Netherlands).
The ELR (25 μmol; 1 equiv) was dissolved in dimethylformamide
(DMF) and, after complete dissolution, a solution of 2 mL BCN–NHS
(250 μmol; 10 equiv) in DMF was added dropwise under nitrogen
atmosphere. The reaction mixture was then stirred overnight at room
temperature. The pure product 1 was obtained as a white
fibrous tissue after precipitation in diethyl ether, followed by washing
in acetone, dialysis (12 000 MWCO—Medicell Membranes
Ltd., Liverpool), and freeze-drying. The degree of modification was
determined by NMR (referencing P1 and P2) and MALDI-TOF. 1H NMR (400 MHz, D2O, δ
in ppm): P1 0.6–1.0 (m, CH3), P2 2.85–2.95 (t, 2H, −CH2–NH–(C=O)–O−).
The NMR spectra were recorded using an Agilent 400 MHz NMR spectrometer
operating at a resonance frequency of 399.95 MHz for 1H.
The spectra were recorded in D2O (20 mg/mL) by performing
500 scans. The degree of conversion was estimated by 1H
NMR, quantifying the isolated α-(C(=O)NH–alkyl)
signals of the introduced functionalities. The conversion of lysine
groups with BCN was limited to 60% due to solubility issues.

Covalent
Binding of Fluorescent Probe and Cholesterol Moieties
[2]
The active ELRs were treated with either
triethyleneglycol-cholesterol azide (CTA; Sigma) and/or Eterneon azide
(Jena Bioscience). ELRs containing 0, 1, 3, or 5 cholesteryl groups
were generated (CTA0–5).

First, the ELR–BCN 1 (20 μmol; 1 equiv) was dissolved in DMF and the azide
CTA (0, 1, 3, 5 equiv) in DMF was added dropwise under nitrogen then
stirred overnight at room temperature. The pure product 2 was obtained as a white fibrous tissue after precipitation in diethyl
ether, followed by washing in acetone, dialysis (12 000 MWCO—Medicell
Membranes Ltd., Liverpool), and freeze-drying. The degree of modification
was determined by NMR (referencing P1 and P3) and MALDI-TOF. 1H NMR (400 MHz, D2O, δ
in ppm): P1 0.6–1.0 (m, CH3), P3 5.30–5.45 (s, 1H, C–CH=C). All samples
obtained were further modified for detection by insertion of a fluorophore
(CTA0–5*). Thus, a solution of CTA0–5 (10 μmol;
1 equiv) in DMF was treated with Eterneon azide (1 μmol; 0.1
equiv) under nitrogen in the dark for 24 h and purified as product 1. Due to the unknown structure of the commercial compound,
insertion of the fluorophore was confirmed by fluorescence spectroscopy
and by comparison of the 1H NMR spectra of the adduct and
product. A new isolated singlet at 10.1–10.3 ppm (P4) was observed (Table 2).

Spectrophotometric Cloud Point Determination
The absorbance
of the ELR solutions was recorded using a Cary Series UV–vis
spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies). The ELR solution was prepared
in PBS (125 μM) and recorded using the CaryWinUV Thermal Application
(version 4.20(468)) over a temperature interval ranging from 5 to
40 °C at a heating rate of 1 °C/min.

Dynamic Light Scattering
The average size distribution
of the modified ELRs was determined by DLS using a Zetasizer Nano
(Malvern Instruments, Worcestershire, U.K.) at 4 or 37 °C, configured
with a 173° scattering angle and equipped with a HeNe laser (633
nm) with an output power of 10 mW. Solutions (125 μM) of the
nonfluorescent ELR–CTA modifications were dissolved in cold
PBS and filtered (0.45 μm poly(vinylidene fluoride) syringe
filter) prior to analysis. The samples were incubated for 10 min at
the specified temperature. Each sample was measured in triplicate
due to LCST-related polydispersity of ELRs volume intensities of samples
are displayed.

Cell Culture
Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle medium,
Medium 231, and smooth muscle growth supplement (SGMS) were purchased
from Thermo Fisher Scientific, fetal bovine serum, penicillin streptomycin
(P/S) solution, trypsin–ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, Dulbecco’s
phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS), and alamarBlue were supplied by
Invitrogen. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs, cc-2517)
and endothelial growth medium (EGM-2) were purchased from Lonza (Lonza,
Europe). Human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMC, ref CRL-1999) were
purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).

HUVECs were cultured in EGM-2 supplemented with 1% P/S and HASMCs
were cultured in Medium 231 supplemented with SGMS and 1% P/S. The
cells were incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO2, and their
medium was replaced every 2 days.

The relative number of metabolically
active cells was evaluated
using the alamarBlue assay according to the manufacturer’s
guidelines. The culture was incubated in 10% alamarBlue solution for
3 h at 37 °C and under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The cells
were cultured in triplicate with medium containing 375 nM, or 750
nM of the nonfluorescent substrates, for 1, 3, and 7 days, respectively.
The data sets were normalized to the same cell type and at the same
time point grown on TCPS. A two-way analysis of variance multiple
comparison was performed using the Holm–Šídák
multiple comparison test. ****P < 0.0001; ***P ≤ 0.001; **P ≤ 0.01; *P < 0.05.

FACS and Confocal Microscopy
A total
of 250 000
cultured cells per condition were incubated for 24 h, followed by
incubation in serum-free media containing ELRCTA (375 nM)
for 18 h. After incubation, the cells were washed several times with
cold DPBS to remove unbound ELRs, then trypsinized, and resuspended
in cold DPBS.

Flow cytometry analysis was performed to assess
the amount of ELRCTA-positive cells. A total of 50 000
events were detected in the cytometer (Gallios flow cytometer, Beckman-Coulter).
Quantification was performed using Kaluza software v1.2 (Beckman-Coulter);
for better quantification, the fluorescent channel was presented on
a logical scale with a linear region from −2 to 15.

The
samples used for FACS quantification were visualized using
a Leica SP5 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg) with
a 63× lens. For better contrast in the merged image, the red
channel was displayed in magenta. Z-Slicing depth on selected cells
was set to 0.4 μm.

The cells prepared for FACS were cultured
in 96-well plates to
track ELRCTA in living cells. Thus, 3000 cells incubated
with ELRCTA were imaged for 18 h at 0.56 mfps. Bright-field
and fluorescence microscopy were performed using a NIKON Eclipse Ti
fluorescence microscope equipped with a digital camera system (Digital
sight DS-2MBWc) (Nikon, Japan).
