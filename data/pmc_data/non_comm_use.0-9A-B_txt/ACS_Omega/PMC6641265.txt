A 2013 paper proposed
a “redox crystallization” (R-C)
mechanism for the formation of Au0n nanoparticles from the reduction of a AuCl4– precursor. That study used an unconventional analysis
of the valuable, expertly obtained kinetics data reported, and came
up with multiple claims and insights collected under the putatively
new R-C mechanism. If confirmed, those claims and the R-C mechanism
provide a valuable addition to the knowledge of gold nanoparticle
formation kinetics and mechanisms. On the other hand, if the methodology
used to support the R-C mechanism is flawed so that its resultant
conclusions are incorrect, then the R-C mechanism needs to be discarded
until compelling evidence for it can be gathered, evidence that would
have to include the disproof of the other dominant mechanism(s) of
nanoparticle formation. The present work provides a critical analysis
of the evidence previously offered for the R-C mechanism, efforts
that are of interest to the areas of Au0n nanoparticles, the kinetics and mechanisms of nanoparticle
formation and, as it turns out, more generally to those interested
in kinetic and mechanistic studies.

1 Introduction
1.1 Previously Proposed “Redox Crystallization”
(R-C) Mechanism for Au0n Nanoparticle
Formation
A 2013 paper presented valuable sigmoidal kinetics
data (Figure 1a) for
the gold nanoparticle formation system summarized in the caption of Figure 1. The date were analyzed
in terms of a so-called “redox crystallization” (R-C)
mechanism, shown in Scheme 1.1

Scheme 1 Previously Proposed Redox Crystallization Mechanism of Gold
Nanoparticle
Formation
Adapted from eqs. F-1, F-2,
and F-3 in ref (1). Mn represents gold precursor
ions, M0l free soluble gold
atoms, and M0s gold atoms in
the solid state, whereas s* is surface active sites
and R is the reductant (in the original article, R was shown as m in the equation but referred
to as R in the text (and as used herein), the m in all probability being just a typographical error). Kc represents the redox equilibrium constant,
and k01 and k02 are the nucleation and growth rate constants, respectively. In the
proposed1 R-C mechanism, step (a) corresponds
to the reversible reduction of gold precursor ions into free soluble
gold atoms, step (b) to the phase transformation of free soluble gold
atoms into the solid state via nucleation, and step (c) to the growth
of nuclei via interaction of free soluble gold atoms with surface
active sites.

Under conditions where the authors
defined the overall rate constant
for nucleation as k1 = αk01 and for growth as k2 = αε[Mn]0k02, the proposed
R-C mechanism yields the integrated kinetic eq 7 in the R-C paper,1 reproduced as eq 1 below. In eq 1, Abst represents the absorbance
at time t for the surface plasmon resonance (SPR)
peak of the gold nanoparticles, measured at 526 nm, and Absmax represents the maximum absorbance (it should be noted that a typo
in eq 7 of the 2013 paper1 was later corrected
in eq 1 of a 2015 review2). The SPR absorbance
data were used as recorded (i.e., without any corrections for particle
size, shape, surface ligand changes, or other factors that can influence
the plasmon resonance3−6). In the overall rate constant expressions for k1 and k2, the term α
accounts for the proposed redox equilibrium, ; ε represents
the fraction of surface
“active” sites, ε = [3 × molar mass (Au)]/[density
(Au) × average radius of Au nanoparticle], and k01 and k02 are the rate constants
for nucleation and growth, respectively (see full derivation of eq 1 in the Supporting Information, part A). 1  A number of aspects and
claims of the R-C
mechanism paper (vide infra) quickly catch the interest of anyone
interested in Au0n nanoparticles,
in nanoparticle formation mechanisms, and in proper kinetics and mechanism
in general.1 Two aspects of the paper1 that immediately caught our eyes are the statements
that “Interestingly, (the) R-C model has (an) identical mathematical
expression as the Finke-Watzky model...”1 (hereafter the FW 2-step model), yet the conflicting statement
in the Supporting Information claiming
that the F–W mechanism “...is totally different from
the R-C mechanism”.1 Additionally,
a very unconventional kinetic treatment was used to provide evidence
for the R-C mechanism, and the overall approach to elucidating the
mechanism was to try to “verify the applicability and validate
the mechanism”1 rather than the
proper scientific approach of attempted disproof of all possible mechanisms.7,8 It is that totally different mechanism and other claims, the unconventional
approach to the kinetics, plus the lack of attempted disproof of other
mechanisms of nanoparticle formation that are the focus of the present
contribution.

1.2 Well-Precedented Alternative
Mechanism of
Nanoparticle Formation: The 1997 FW 2-Step Mechanism of Slow, Continuous
Nucleation and Autocatalytic Surface Growth
The currently
most highly cited (>500 citations as of 2017, according to SciFinder),
accepted minimal mechanism for nanoparticle “slow continuous
nucleation and fast autocatalytic surface growth” is the FW
2-step model, shown in Scheme 2, with its associated integrated kinetic eq 2.9 Of note here
is that the FW 2-step mechanism has been shown to account for gold nanoparticle formation by other research groups.10−12

Scheme 2 FW 2-Step Mechanism of Slow Nucleation and Fast Autocatalytic Surface
Growth9 Shown in Its Simplest and Then
Generalized Form13,14
Here, A represents
precursor metal ions (e.g., nominally AuCl4– in the present example) and B the growing metal
nanocluster past its nucleus size (rigorously, by stoichiometry B = Au0 in the present example), whereas k1 and k2 are the
average rate constants for nucleation and growth, steps (a) and (b),
respectively.

The integrated kinetic eq 2 shows the concentration
of B, the growing
metal nanocluster, expressed as a function of time, the average rate
constants for nucleation and growth, k1 and k2, respectively, and [A]0, the initial concentration of metal precursor ions A.9 2  To account for surface sites involved in autocatalytic surface growth (i.e., for the B = Au0 that are covered up in the growing nanoparticle), a scaling
factor was originally developed in 1997 and applied to include B atoms on the surface of the growing nanocluster only (see
footnote 46 and Appendix C in ref (9)), that is, xgrowth = increase in the number of surface atoms/increase in the total
numbers of atoms, with the scaling correction factor applied to the
value of the growth rate constant extracted from a curve fit to eq 2, . Since then, Schmidt and Smirnov have developed
a continuous function based on the FW model that describes the dependence
of the number of surface atoms on the total number of atoms.15

Also relevant to what follows is that,
as apparent rate constants
for (composite) pseudoelementary steps, k1 and k2 are expected to show concentration
dependence(s). Indeed, in the original 1997 FW paper,9 both k1 and k2 showed a dependence on the reductant H2 concentration;
see Figures 5 and 7 and footnote 37 in ref (9).

1.3 Questions Raised by an
Initial Comparison
of the FW 2-Step and R-C Mechanisms
It is easily seen that
the overall rate constants proposed by the R-C model coincide conceptually
with the pseudoelementary rate constants defined by FW (eq 3) and recalling the terms defined
above: 3  A comparison of the integrated kinetic eqs 1 and 2 shows that, indeed and as the R-C mechanism paper notes, these two
equations are identical mathematically. It
follows that the basic mechanism underlying both the FW 2-step mechanism
and the “R-C” mechanism must also be very close, if
not functionally identical. However, as already briefly noted
in their Supporting Information, the authors of the 2013 paper claim
that the FW mechanism “...is totally different from the R-C
mechanism”.1 Moreover, the R-C model
has since reappeared in a 2015 paper,2 where
it was presented as novel and without reference to the 1997 FW 2-step
mechanism, that is, as if the R-C model is indeed as claimed “totally
different”1 from the FW 2-step mechanism.
Is this “totally different” claim actually supported?
If totally different, it would be an important advance in the mechanisms
of nanoparticle nucleation and growth. Indeed, a totally different
mechanism hidden under identical mathematics would, if correct, be
of broad importance to both kinetics and mechanisms, in general, and
specifically to nucleation and growth across nature given the broad
range of sigmoidal curves accounted for at present by the FW 2-step
mechanism.10,13,14,16−26

Hence, the postulated R-C model raises several questions.
(i) Is the R-C model actually novel and different from the 1997 FW
2-step mechanism as claimed?1,2 Second, (ii) does it
make sense kinetically and mathematically to do what the authors of
the 2013 paper did, in their unconventional treatment of the kinetics
data, to try to obtain evidence for the R-C mechanism? Specifically,
can one as they did plot sigmoidal kinetic data by
separate zeroth-, first-, and second-order plots, as reproduced, respectively,
in Figure 1b–d from the 2013 paper,1 and then “cherry pick” each small, linear
part of just a section of those separate plots and then also
interpret that small linear section as evidence for mechanistic steps
that are zeroth-, first-, and then second-order throughout
the whole kinetic curve? Can one do this even though the
linear regions are observed for only brief time periods of the full
kinetic curve? Does this unconventional kinetic treatment, which differs
from Michaelis–Menten enzyme saturation kinetics27 or graphical rate equations28 and does not provide the normal “sufficient high
quality [kinetic] data over the course of the reaction”,28 make sense? (The authors themselves note that
“Such sigmoidal kinetic curves were for the first time analyzed
by conventional rate laws”.1) (iii)
Crucially, a fit to the well-precedented FW 2-step mechanism was not
tried previously but should have been the first attempt to fit the
data in the 2013 paper. In the end analysis then, (iv) is the R-C
mechanism something new and novel, with value to the nanoparticle
nucleation, growth, and agglomeration kinetic and mechanistic literature,
or not? It is the answers to these four primary questions that are
the focus of the present study, a critical reanalysis of the 2013
paper that resulted in the redox crystallization mechanism. The results
should be of interest to anyone interested in Au0n nanoparticles, in the mechanisms of nanoparticle
formation, and in proper kinetic and mechanistic analyses, in general.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 FW 2-Step
Mechanism Fits the Data in the 2013
Paper
Figure 2 shows a fit of the FW 2-step mechanism and associated integrated
kinetics equation (eq 2 above) to the Figure 1b kinetics data in the 2013 paper.1 The fit is excellent according to the R2 = 0.9987 and by visual examination. The SPR
absorbance data were used without correction for possible size, shape,
ligand, or other effects3−6 as done in the 2013 paper.1 The fit to the FW 2-step mechanism is excellent29 and suggests that any effects on the surface plasmon resonance
(when expressed per B = Au0 atom in the
growing nanocluster) are either relatively small over the range of
nucleation and growth monitored and/or convoluted into one or more
of the measured rate constants (if so, then mostly into k2 is what one would expect since the kinetically effective
nucleus30,31 is likely small, just a couple of atoms
being precedented for Ag nanos32,33). The former explanation
is consistent with recent studies from one of our laboratories (MW)
that found similar rate constants within experimental error for Ag(0)n nanoparticle formation followed by the plasmon
resonance compared to two different, more direct methods.34 That said, there are a number of issues to consider
when using the SPR to monitor nanoparticle formation kinetics, a discussion
of which is provided in the Supporting Information.

Figure 2 Product fraction data (x = Abst/Absmax) digitized from Figure 1b1 and curve-fitted
to the FW 2-step mechanism.9 Curve fit
values are k1 = 2.19 × 10–5 s–1, k2 = 0.234 s–1 for [A]0 = 1.00, with R2 = 0.9987.

The excellent fit to the FW 2-step mechanism is expected
because
this mechanism has been shown to account for a very wide range of
nanoparticle formation systems under reductive and other conditions,35−38 including Au0n nanoparticles.10−12,29 Hence, just from the fit in Figure 2 to the FW 2-step
mechanism, by literature precedent,10,29,35−38 and with the application of Ockham’s razor
(i.e., until there is additional compelling evidence demanding a more
complicated or different mechanism), the FW 2-step mechanism is the
best currently precedented way to minimally, but efficiently and effectively,
describe the system in Scheme 1 and kinetics data in Figure 1b. This was not done before as part of the 2013 work.1

2.2 Re-examination of the Use
in the 2013 Paper
of Separate Linear Zeroth-, First-, and Second-Order Plots, of Selected
Sections of the Kinetics Curve, To Offer Putative Evidence for the
Reaction Mechanism over the Full Time Course of the Reaction, Including
for the Prior Equilibrium Step Proposed in the R-C Mechanism
A look back at the R-C mechanism in Scheme 1 from the 2013 paper,
and in comparison to the FW 2-step mechanism in Scheme 2, reveals that the only true difference (vide
infra, section 2) is
the reductive prior equilibrium of gold precursor ions, Mn in Scheme 1, by the reductant, R (l-ascorbic acid in Figure 1 data), to putatively produce soluble gold atoms (M01), that is, Mn + R ⇆ M0l (equilibrium constant Kc), as postulated in the R-C mechanism (Scheme 1). Is there really an equilibrium, as opposed
to the dependence on reductant already established in 1997
for the FW 2-step mechanism (H2 in that case9)? Hence, it follows that the next crucial task
is to examine carefully and critically the evidence in the 2013 paper
for the addition of the prior equilibrium, Mn+ R ⇆ M0l.

In their analysis of the kinetics data, the authors
stated that1 “the reduction of the
gold precursors was relatively faster than the crystallization process,
i.e., the latter... becomes the rate-determining step during... [gold
nanoparticle] formation” and “Therefore..., we assume
reduction of gold precursor (Mn) by reductants (R) as a reversible reaction...
with an equilibrium constant Kc.”
Restated, in their R-C mechanism, the authors set up a faster “reduction”
first step (step (a) in Scheme 1) that then acts as a bottleneck for the slower “crystallization”
second step (nucleation and growth, steps (b) and (c) in Scheme 1). Hence, their interpretation
of the kinetics data, and its use as “supporting evidence”
for the above, is what needs to be examined in some detail next.

The authors expressed a product (or “crystallization”)
fraction x corresponding to the normalized absorbance
at 526 nm for the SPR peak of the gold nanoparticles.1 A plot of x versus time produced a “zeroth-order”
graph (Figure 1b, vide
supra, for zeroth-order kinetics “rate = constant”)
that exhibits a linear region from just ca. 34–48 s (or 8 data
points).1 The authors claimed from this
that “the overall crystallization rate was zeroth order with
respect to the reactants (namely gold atoms in this case)”
because “excessive gold monomers competed for relatively limited
active sites” and that “at this stage all of the Au(III)
species had either been reduced to its atomic state or into its lower
charge states”. A plot of ln(1/(1 – x)) versus time produced a “first-order” graph (Figure 1c, vide supra, for
first-order kinetics, rate = constant × reactant fraction) that exhibits a linear
region from just ca. 46–54 s (or 5 data points).1 A plot of (1/(1 – x))
– 1 versus time produced a “second-order” graph
(Figure 1d, vide supra,
for second-order kinetics, rate = constant × (reactant fraction)2) that exhibits
a linear region from just ca. 52–56 s (or 3 data points).1 The authors concluded that, “with the
crystallization proceeding forward, it changed to first order... and
subsequently to second order... which indicated that the concentration
of gold monomers declined and its influence became evident on the
crystallization rate” and that it “resembled... Michaelis-Menten
kinetics in enzyme catalysis”.

Here, the authors refer
to enzyme saturation kinetics,27 in which
a zeroth-order dependence of the reaction
rate on substrate concentration is expected at larger substrate concentrations,
with a first-order dependence expected at lower concentrations. Hence,
and as a test of these claims, herein we employed graphical rate equations
(reaction progress kinetic analysis28)
as a way to help visualize the reaction rate dependence on reactant
concentration (or fraction of reaction). Specifically, for the data
reported in Figure 1b, the reaction rate was calculated from the graph and expressed
as a function of time (Figure 3) or as a function of the reactant fraction, 1 – x (Figure 4; a similar plot could be expressed as a function of the product
fraction x). Note that the reaction progress in Figure 4 should be read from
right to left. The highlighted data points corresponding to the 34
to 48 s time period show that the reaction rate is not constant
there (Figure 3) nor does it display a zeroth order (“flat”)
dependence on reactant concentration (Figure 4). The fact that a linear portion of the
growth curve (Figure 1 b) exists around its inflection point is explained in section 2.3 and, in fact,
is predicted by the FW mechanism (vide infra). Similar graphical rate
equations28 were constructed to look at
a first- or second-order dependence of the reaction rate on reactant
concentration (fraction) and are shown in part B of the Supporting Information.

Figure 3 Reaction rate (dx/dt, with x representing
the product fraction) calculated graphically
from the data in Figure 1b1 and plotted versus time. Data points
corresponding to the time period of 34–48 s (see Figure 1b) are highlighted. The key
point to note is that the reaction rate is not constant over this
interval, which in turn invalidates any claim of a constant, zeroth-order
reaction over this interval.

Figure 4 Reaction rate (dx/dt, with x representing the product fraction) calculated graphically
from the data in Figure 1b1 and plotted versus the reactant fraction
1 – x. Here, reaction progress should be read
from right to left (1 – x = 1 to 1 – x = 0).28 Data points corresponding
to the time period of 34 to 48 s (see Figure 1b, vide supra) are highlighted. The take-home
message is again that the reaction rate is not constant; hence, the
reaction is not the previously claimed zeroth order1 over this interval.

Beyond the disproof of the zeroth-order claim provided by Figures 3 and 4, reflection reveals that assuming a reaction order, from
any plot that shows that order for just a fraction of the whole reaction,
is not a valid kinetics approach. The above reinforces the well-known
rule of chemical kinetics: the integrated rate equation must fit all
of the reaction time course under consideration. This is a fundamental
rule of chemical kinetics that one cannot violate. The same analysis
as above also disproves the use of first-order and second-order plots
in the 2013 paper,1 as reproduced in Figure 1c,d, vide supra.

Note that we do not mean to imply here that biphasic, triphasic,
or even higher-phasic kinetic curves are not seen in chemical science.
In those cases, yes, one is forced to use more than one kinetic fit,
but even then only for different (but whole; complete) portions of
the kinetic curve and only after (i) showing that no single mechanism
is able to fit the whole curve, and even then, (ii) the postulated
second, say biphasic part of the kinetics must, itself, be well-fit
by that second proposed mechanism over the whole second part of the
(second half) of the kinetic curve. Highly relevant to the present
case and the R-C model, then, is that a single mechanism and its associated
integrated rate equation is able to fit the full kinetic data offered
in the 2013 paper, namely, the FW 2-step mechanism, as shown in Figure 2.

2.3 Understanding the Origin of the Linear Part
of Figure 1b
It is of some interest at this point to examine what the linear part
of Figure 1b actually
corresponds to and for the sake of a better understanding of sigmoidal
curves so common in nucleation and growth phase change processes across
nature. Recently, we took the first, second, and third derivatives
(the latter the so-called “jerk”) of our eq 2, corresponding to the FW 2-step
mechanism, to learn more about what controls the shape and key points
such as the induction period, linear section, and inflection point
of such sigmoidal growth curves.39 While
we refer the interested reader to that work, the most relevant part
for the present paper is what the linear portion of the kinetic curve
in Figure 1b corresponds
to (eq 4 and also in Figure 1a, if concentration
is expressed instead of fraction): 4  As eq 4 teaches, the linear portion or maximum slope
is a function
of k1, k2,
and [A]0, not time; it is thus constant
or “zeroth order” in that sense. Indeed, the maximum
slope is found around the inflection point of the sigmoidal curve,
at a time where the rate reaches a maximum and the acceleration changes
sign.39 The FW 2-step mechanism further
teaches why, phenomenologically, a linear portion in the sigmoidal
curve is seen: the rate of nucleation plus its magnification by autocatalytic
growth has reached a maximum, and the depleted concentration of [A] means that the reaction is slowing down, overall exhibiting
a composite region that just happens to be linear and which obeys eq 4. The analytic expressions
for the tinduction, tinflection-point, and [B]max at the inflection point are also available elsewhere for
the interested reader.39

2.4 R-C Mechanism Does Not Yield a Different Integrated
Rate Equation, Does Not Yield Any Evidence for the Proposed Prior
Equilibrium, and Does Not Yield a Value for Its Putative Kc Equilibrium Constant
An important practical
point can be raised at this juncture: as is obvious by a comparison
of eq 1 for the R-C mechanism
to eq 2 for the FW 2-step
mechanism, as well as by the author’s own admission that the
“R-C model has (an) identical mathematical expression as the
Finke-Watzky model...”,1 fits to
either the R-C model or the FW 2-step mechanism yield identical
phenomenological observables, k1and k2in the FW 2-step model nomenclature, and with k2(R-C) (=k2(FW)[A]0) in the R-C model.
That is, practically speaking, even if one accepted the now disproven
R-C mechanism, no new information results from its current implementation
(i.e., no Kc value example for the putative
prior equilibrium of the R-C model). The claimed “...totally
different...” R-C model is, actually, mathematically as well
as functionally identical to the FW 2-step model. The R-C model is,
therefore, not new and should be abandoned until and unless compelling
evidence for it is provided.

Worth noting here is that such
“identical measurable rate constant results” will be
the case when any, and any number, of fast Keq are added prior to the two steps of the
FW mechanism (as the R-C mechanism does with its putative prior Kc). It is easy to show mathematically that adding
prior fast Keq will just produce pseudoelementary
steps that will have composite rate constants that are indistinguishable
from k1 and k2 of the FW 2-step mechanism (see elsewhere for more on pseudoelementary
steps9). Part A of the Supporting Information, which provides more detail on the
derivation of eqs 1–7 in the 2013 R−C model paper,1 also serves as a short mathematical proof of
this point.

A reviewer (whom we thank) noted that one might
use the term “irreducible”
to describe the FW 2-step model (vs “reducible” for
the postulated R−C mechanism). However, the term irreducible
has a strict mathematical meaning that we do not wish to claim in
the absence of the required, detailed, mathematical analysis. Rather,
the FW 2-step model is based on a minimalistic “Ockham’s
razor”40 approach and yields pseudoelementary
average rate constants which can sometimes be experimentally deconvoluted
in favorable systems (vide infra).

2.5 Fundamental
Underlying Problem with the Science
in the 2013 Paper Is That They Attempted the—Impossible!—Proof
of Their Proposed R-C Mechanism, Rather than Trying To Disprove It
It can been seen at this stage that the most fundamental, and hence
greatest, underlying problem with the prior work leading to the R-C
mechanism is the attempt therein to gather evidence to try to “prove”
their postulated R-C mechanism. The instead needed correct approach
of epistemologically sound science7,8 is of course
the disproof of all reasonable, multiple alternative
hypothesis—in this case, all reasonable alternative mechanisms—followed
by the application of Ockham’s razor40 to choose the simplest mechanism consistent with the available data.

Notable in this regard are the now over 21 alternative mechanisms
that have been disproven41−44 en route to the highly disproof-based FW 2-step mechanism
and its expanded 4-step mechanism of slow, continuous nucleation,
autocatalytic surface growth, and two kinds of agglomeration that
has been built off of (and hence which contain) the FW 2-step mechanism.9,31,41−44

2.6 Additional
Issues with the Approach Used To
Obtain and the Resultant R-C Mechanism
For the sake of completeness,
the additional problems in the prior kinetic analysis and proposed
R-C mechanism are dealt with in part C of the Supporting Information for the interested reader.

2.7 Despite the Current Broad Applicability of
the Deliberately Minimalistic FW 2-Step Mechanism, It Is Important
To Find Valid Examples Where the 2-Step Mechanism Can Be Expanded
To Reveal the Always Present, Additional Steps Underlying the Pseudoelementary
Step Treatment and the More Intimate, More Complex Mechanisms
The FW 2-step mechanism currently enjoys very broad, expanding application
in many parts of the natural world, including to multiple metal nanoparticle
formation systems35−38—including gold nanoparticles,10 homogeneous catalyst formation,16−18 heterogeneous catalyst
formation,19 catalyst sintering phenomena,20 protein aggregation,13,14,21,22 solid-state
kinetics,23,24 dye aggregation,25 and other areas of nature.26 The strengths
of the 2-step mechanism and multiple insights it allows are summarized
elsewhere for the interested reader, as are the weaknesses
and caveats of the deliberately minimalistic, deliberately
Ockham’s-razor-obeying, FW 2-step mechanism44—caveats and weaknesses that anyone using our mechanism
needs to understand in order to use it properly. The weaknesses of
the FW 2-step mechanism derive from its deliberately minimalistic,
in the end analysis oversimplified, nature that thereby yields average
results for systems that may contain 100s (to 1000s) of elementary
steps. It follows, therefore, that a very important future effort
is to expand upon and discover the more intimate, more complex mechanisms
for nucleation, growth, and agglomeration systems that are well-fit
initially by the FW 2-step mechanism.

There are currently five
examples to our knowledge where systems that have been initially fit
by the 2-step mechanism have been expanded to reveal their underlying,
more complex mechanisms10,16,24,45,46—so that the needed work of the true, underlying mechanisms
for sigmoidal curves fit by the FW 2-step mechanism is just starting
and needs to be continued. (i) The first of these is our collaboration
with the Bergman research group, where the development of a homogeneous
catalyst showed sigmoidal, autocatalytic kinetics but where the true
catalyst and the underlying catalytic mechanism remained completely
obscure.16 To get at the mechanism, a fit
to the 2-step mechanism was done and yielded a good fit. That good
fit, in turn, revealed that figuring out what “B” is was key, B being the true, but hidden,
catalyst in the reaction. The catalyst B was then
identified via trial and error writing of the multiple steps that
had to add up to the A → B, then A + B → 2B pseudoelementary steps (see the highly illustrative Supporting
Information provided with that paper16).
This led to identification of the previously hidden PtCl(t-Bu3P)2(SnMe3) catalyst, after which
it proved easy to write the catalytic cycle.16 This example is the presently best available example we are aware
of illustrating the power of the minimalistic, simple 2-step mechanism
to reveal an underlying catalyst and more complex mechanism that,
prior to the fit to the 2-step mechanism, was completely obscure and
at an intractable standstill prior to the fit to the 2-step mechanism.16

A second example is (ii) by Kytsya and
co-workers who, after a
fit to the FW 2-step mechanism to their Ag+ plus N2H4 and NaOH, Ag0n nanoparticle formation system,45 expertly expanded the kinetics to flush out the underlying reaction
orders for all the reagents otherwise hidden by the two pseudoelementary
steps in the minimalistic 2-step mechanism. A third example is (iii)
by Sergievskaya and co-workers and is also for Ag+ reduction
by N2H4, but now in the presence of reverse
micelles. Here, these authors also elucidated the underlying, more
detailed rate law and implied more intimate mechanism in greater detail
than revealed by the initial fit to the 2-step mechanism.46 Sergievskaya and co-workers (iv) also expanded
greatly beyond the initial 2-step FW mechanism in a Au0n nanoparticle formation, again using
N2H4 as the reductant, with a series of more
detailed steps supported by additional kinetic evidence (steps and
eqs 3–18 in their valuable, insightful paper10).

The final example is the very nice effort of Bardeen
and co-workers
who insightfully use, and especially then expand past, the FW 2-step
model to uncover the more intimate mechanism of photochemical dimerization
of 9-methylanthracene in the solid state.24 We hope to see many more of these valuable mechanistic studies that
use the FW 2-step mechanism as it is intended and best used—as
a starting point for greater mechanistic insight
into nucleated autocatalytic growth processes across in nature.

3 Conclusions
The primary conclusions from
the present reanalysis of the “redox
crystallization” model and the valuable, expertly collected
data the authors provided therein can be summarized as follows:The kinetic methodology used to try
to support the R-C
model, namely, finding small regions in sigmoidal curves that show
linear sections for randomly selected (zeroth-, first-, and second-order)
rate laws, is a conceptually and mathematically flawed approach that
has no basis in modern chemical kinetics.

Reflection reveals the following: the precedented mechanism
that will give the linear regions seen by the 2013 authors in their
zeroth-, first-, and second-order plots—that is, the simple,
minimal mechanism that those authors were trying to discover—is
the FW 2-step mechanism. Put another way, the analytic function corresponding
to the FW 2-step mechanism is the only currently known, minimal-mechanism-based
function that will give the linear zeroth-, first-, and second-order
plots that the authors see!

The putative
R-C mechanism and its postulated prior Kc equilibrium have no experimental basis nor
support at this time. It, too, should be discarded until and unless
it receives compelling supporting evidence.

A comparison of the integrated rate equation for the
R-C model to that established 20 years ago for the FW 2-step model
(eq 1 compared to eq 2, respectively) shows that
they are identical mathematically and, hence, in the end will yield
the (apparent, composite, pseudoelementary step rate constants) k1 and k2 of the
FW 2-step model. Hence, the presently unsupported, herein disproven
claim that the R-C model “...is totally different...”
from the FW 2-step model needs to be abandoned until and unless compelling
evidence to support such a claim is obtained.

A broader, important point is the demonstration herein
that identical mathematical equations will result anytime fast prior Keq are added to the FW 2-step model since the
proposed steps can be summed to pseudoelementary steps that still
have primarily a A → B and
then A + B → 2B form—see examples elsewhere that teach that even more complex
equations and mechanisms can still show sigmoidal shape and be fit
by the 2-step mechanism.16,17 This means that efforts
to expand beyond the FW 2-step model will need to provide compelling
evidence for any additional equilibria or other proposed steps.

The above points so made, it is important
to continue
to strive to discover the underlying steps that are hidden in the
disproof-based, deliberately minimalistic (so it can be as rigorous
as possible), FW 2-step mechanism. Five examples where doing just
that were presented,10,16,24,45,46 along with
references to the weaknesses and caveats as well as the strengths
of the FW 2-step mechanism.44 Those papers
are recommended to anyone using the FW 2-step or using the more complex,
but still minimalistic, disproof-based, and Ockham’s razor
obeying 4-step mechanisms that are built off of the FW 2-step mechanism.41−44

Any future effort to understand the
Au0n formation system in the
2013 paper, or any
other nucleation, growth, or agglomeration system for that matter,
will have to avoid the compounding mistake made in the 2013 paper,
that is, the failure to read carefully and understand as fully as
possible the huge, disparate, literature of nucleation, growth, and
agglomeration processes across nature. It is becoming harder to discover
anything new that has not already been proposed in a more general
way in the broad literature of nucleation, growth, and agglomeration
processes across nature, at least in our opinion. However, easier
and still very important to discover are the more intimate, underlying
mechanistic steps10,16,24,45,46 that add up
the FW 2-step kinetic scheme.

Finally,
we end with the same important point we find
ourselves ending many of our papers with these days: only a scientific
method that consists of the attempted disproof of
all reasonable, multiple alternative hypotheses is able to discover
new mechanisms and, indeed, to verify new science.7,8 As
Platt has noted, “for exploring the unknown, there is no faster
method” than the attempted disproof of multiple, alternative
hypotheses.8



4 Methods
4.1 Data Digitization
Data were extracted
and digitized from the published curves1 using Digitizelt 2.2.1. As noted in the main text, the raw surface
plasmon resonance absorbance data were used in the curve fitting.

4.2 Curve Fitting
The digitized data
were fit to eq 2 using
OriginLab 2017 with a nonlinear curve-fitting function. The values
of the rates constants k1 and k2 and of the initial precursor concentration
[A]0 were obtained from the curve fit.

4.3 Graphs
Graphical differentiation
was performed with OriginLab 2017. All graphs were plotted with Excel.
