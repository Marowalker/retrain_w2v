An interesting synthetic
transformation of protection–deprotection
chemistry in an isatin molecule is achieved. Morita–Baylis–Hillman
(MBH) adduct formation used as protection of the C-3 position in the
isatin molecule is reported. C–C bond cleavage in the MBH adduct
of isatin with the help of phenylhydrazine and C=N bond cleavage
in the phenylhydrazone derivative of isatin with the help of K10 clay
are studied systematically and reported as deprotection.

Introduction
The chemistry of indoline-2,3-dione
(isatin)1−15 functionalization at the 1,3,4,5,6-positions leads to attractive
applications among major classifications of chemical, biological,
and medicinal fields of science. Functionalization of these positions
is well established in the literature, such as Morita–Baylis–Hillman
addition reaction16−32 (MBH adduct formation at C-3 position), substitution reactions (N-alkylation, aromatic electrophilic substitution), oxidation,
and reduction. To conduct one particular reaction in the core structure
of the isatin molecule, some of the positions have to be protected
using protection–deprotection chemistry. For instance, substitution
of the N–H position of the isatin molecule
was done after protection of the C-3 position (carbonyl protection),
which is reported in the literature as 1,2-diol protection.33 However, the protection of the C-3 position
of isatin with the help of a well-known MBH adduct forming reaction
was not explored as protection of the C-3 position of indoline-2,3-dione
(isatin). Thus, the protection concept by means of adduct formation
is untouched from 2005 to 2018. Hence, we planned to study and report
such a methodology as a novel work in this paper.

Results and Discussion
Our initial work started from MBH adduct formation. The reaction
of simple isatin with methyl acrylate and DABCO afforded C-3-protected
methyl 2-(3-hydroxy-2-oxoindolin-3-yl)acrylate 1a.

The MBH adduct 1a was allowed to deprotect by means
of C–C bond cleavage.34−48 An interesting approach employed is a reaction with phenylhydrazine
hydrochloride.49 In that attempt, formation
of a mixture of E/Z isomers of 3-(2-phenylhydrazono)indolin-2-one 1b (yield in a range of 35–56%) confirmed the C–C
bond cleavage in 1a (Scheme 1). The generality for the C–C bond
cleavage reaction was achieved using different MBH adducts of isatin 2a–7a and afforded the corresponding C–C
bond cleaved products 2b–7b in good
to excellent yields (55–88%). The reactions are shown in Figure 1. Consequently, starting
materials 2a–4a for eqs 1, 2, and
3 were prepared by general N-alkylation of the isatin
procedure. However, starting materials 5a–7a for eqs 4, 5, and 6 were prepared from our own previous
procedures.50−53

as deprotection.

Scheme 1 MBH Adduct as C-3
Protection and C–C Bond Cleavage as Deprotection
For the improvement in the
yield of the C–C bond cleavage
reactions, different phenylhydrazines were tested as shown in Scheme 2. Thus, the C–C
bond cleavage occurred very efficiently when the reagent was with
either phenylhydrazine hydrochloride solid or phenylhydrazine liquid,
and the formation of phenylhydrazone 2b in very good
to excellent yields was found. However, while using 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine
hydrochloride solid, the C–C bond cleaving product 2b′ was formed in excellent yield (Scheme 2, eq iii). After finding a good result with
2,4-dinitrophenylhyrazine hydrochloride (DNP, colored reagent), further
studies were performed with DNP itself for the C–C bond cleavage
purpose.

Scheme 2 Yield Optimization of C–C Bond Cleavage
To reproduce the C-3 position as β-carbonyl
(ketone functionality),
the phenyhydrazone part of intermediate products 2b and 2b′ should be worked up with an acid to perform C=N
bond cleavage. To remove the phenylhydrazone part from the isatin
core, a systematic study was conducted as shown in Table 1. Two reactions were performed:
one was by adding a solvent with dilute HCl (condition A) and the
other was by adding solvents with and without K-10 clay (condition
B). In this study, room temperature (RT) to high boiling chlorobenzene
reflux conditions were tested for phenylhydrazone cleavage (C=N),
and different adducts were also examined to know the electrochemical
effect on the deprotection procedure. Hence, entries 1, 2, 4, 6, 8,
and 12 in the Table 1 did not show the phenylhydrazone cleavage part, whereas entries
5, 7, and 10 showed a positive sign for the cleavage of the —C=N
bond monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC).

Finally, the second step of the deprotection procedure
was considered
as the optimum condition where it uses acetone/K-10 clay (Table 1, entry 3). Moreover,
a mixture of E/Z isomers in phenyhydrazone
products 2b–7b was directly allowed
to remove the phenylhydrazone part and get isatin back as a C-3 regenerated
product. It was found that the C=N cleavage occurred in one
of the isomers of phenylhydrazone products. To find isomer selectivity,
after column separation, both were tried for the C=N cleavage
reaction separately. Between the isomers, the E isomer
gets the C=N cleavage, whereas the H-bond-stabilized Z isomer does not undergo the C=N bond cleavage (Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Isomer Selectivity
of C=N Bond Cleavage Reaction
After finding this result, only E isomers
of 2b–7b were allowed for the C=N
bond cleavage reaction and found 100% conversion in all cases monitored
by TLC (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Generality
for the C=N bond cleavage reaction from the E isomer.

For the justification of protection–deprotection
methodology
in isatin molecules, careful stepwise reactions were conducted as
shown in Figure 3.
The C-3 position of isatin is protected by means of MBH adduct formation
using methyl acrylate or acrylonitrile with DABCO to get the compound 2a/3a (30 min for the nitrile adduct; 3–6 days for
the acrylate adduct). The MBH adduct 2a/3a is treated
with CAN in a 1:1 methanol/acetonytrile solvent mixture to afford
either five formyl derivatives50 or one
(N-methylene methylether)51,52 position of the functionalized MBH adduct of isatin 2a′/3a′. Then, the adduct 2a′/3a′ is treated with 1.2 equiv of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine
to afford the C–C bond-cleaved phenylhydrazone product 2b/3b. Removal of the phenylhydrazone part of product 2b/3b leads to the formation of differently functionalized
isatin 6c/7c.

Figure 3 Pictorial justification for the protection–deprotection
methodology in isatin molecules.

A final positive conclusion came to end our study by comparing
between the starting material and the final product using TLC followed
by spectrum analysis using UV–vis spectroscopy without any
ambiguity (Figure 4). The starting material (SM) taken for the final conclusion was
1,5-dimethylisatin, and its UV absorption (λmax)
is 253 nm. The first step was to form an adduct in a duration of 3
days for C-3 protection (converting the SM to the MBH adduct with
methyl acrylate and a catalytic amount of DABCO in ethanol). The second
step was to deprotect, which was achieved in two stages: (i) C–C
bond cleavage using 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine hydrochloride and (ii)
treatment of phenylhydrazone with acetone/K10 clay to get C-3 ketone
in the isatin molecule. After reaching these steps, the resulting
product (isatin) showed a sharp UV absorption band (λmax) at 253 nm, more clear and similar with purchased isatin.

Figure 4 UV spectroscopic
proof for protection–deprotection in isatin.

The UV spectral comparison study was found general
with different
isatins (for instance, N-methylisatin, 1-methyl-5-nitroisatin,
1-methyl-5-formylisatin, and 1-propargylisatin). The result is shown
in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Generality
of UV spectroscopic proof for protection–deprotection
chemistry in isatins.

This is to emphasize that our method is short and simple
and that
there is no need for column purification. A comparative experiment
was conducted as in Scheme 4. Thus, the traditional protection of the isatin molecule
with 1,2-diol formed the acetonide followed by hydrolysis using the
condition of 1.18 N HClO4-THF, 25 °C, and 8 days,
which afforded the isatin derivative and byproduct. However, our method
needs only 3 h to get pure and crystalline isatin without any side
products.

Conclusions
As
a conclusion, a systematic and elaborate study has been conducted
to demonstrate protection (MBH adduct formation) followed by deprotection
(phenylhydrazone formation and its removal; C–C, C=N
bond cleavage) aspects. It is noteworthy that the methodology can
be applied in the alkaloid natural product intermediate synthesis
and biological and medicinal areas of isatin derivatives.

Experimental
Details
General Experimental Procedure for N-Alkylation
of Isatin
A mixture of isatin (1 mmol), alkyl bromide/iodide
(1.5 mmol), and calcium hydride (3 mmol) in DMF was stirred at 60
°C for 1 h. After completing the reaction (monitored by TLC),
the reaction mixture was poured into water, neutralized with 2 N HCl,
and then extracted using ethyl acetate. The organic layer was separated,
dried (Na2SO4), and concentrated in vacuo. The
crude product obtained was purified by silica gel column chromatography
using EtOAc/hexane (20:80) as eluent to afford the desired N-alkylisatin.

General Experimental Procedure for the Preparation
of MBH Adducts
of Isatin (Protection of the C-3 Position of Isatin)
A mixture
of N-alkylisatin (1 mol), 1.5 equiv of ethyl acrylate
(1.5 mmol), and 0.02 equiv of DABCO (0.02 mmol) in ethanol (5 mL)
was stirred at RT for 3–6 days. After completing the reaction
(monitored by TLC), the reaction mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate.
The organic layer was washed successively with 0.2 N HCl. The organic
layer was separated, dried (Na2SO4), and concentrated
in vacuo. The crude product obtained was purified by silica gel column
chromatography using EtOAc/hexane (20:80) as eluent to afford the
desired MBH adduct of N-alkylisatin.

General Procedure
for the C–C Bond Cleavage (Deprotection
of the MBH Adduct to Phenylhydrazone Followed by Isatin Formation)
(i) A mixture
of the MBH adduct (50 mg,
0.20 mmol) and 1.5 equiv of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine was made as
a paste and ground in a mortar and pestle in solvent-free conditions
at room temperature (30 min). The crude reaction mixture was purified
by silica gel column chromatography using EtOAc/hexane (20:80) as
the eluent to afford 3-(2-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)hydrazono)-1,5-dimethylindolin-2-one.

(ii) A mixture of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone
of the MBH adduct of 1,5-dimethylisatin (0.05 g, 0.20 mmol) and 100%
(w/w) K-10 clay was added with acetone (2.5 mL) and stirred at RT
for 30 min. After completing the reaction (monitored by TLC), the
reaction mixture was filtered to remove the clay, and the filtrate
was evaporated to get the pure crystalline product 1,5-dimethylisatin
(85%, 0.0376 g).
