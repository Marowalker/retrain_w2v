Dragonfly
wings are of great interest to researchers investigating
biomimetic designs for antiwetting and antibacterial surfaces. The
waxy epicuticular layer on the membrane of dragonfly wings possesses
a unique surface nanoarchitecture that consists of irregular arrays
of nanoscale pillars. This architecture confers superhydrophobic,
self-cleaning, antiwetting, and antibiofouling behaviors. There is
some evidence available that suggests that lifestyle factors may have
influenced the evolution of the wing nanostructures and, therefore,
the resulting properties of the wings; however, it appears that no
systematic studies have been performed that have compared the wing
surface features across a range of dragonfly species. Here, we provided
a comparison of relevant wing surface characteristics, including chemical
composition, wettability, and nanoarchitecture, of seven species of
dragonfly from three families including Libellulidae, Aeshnidae, and Gomphidae. The characteristic nanopillar arrays were found to be present,
and the chemical composition and the resultant wing surface superhydrophobicity
were found to be well-conserved across all of the species studied.
However, subtle differences were observed between the height, width,
and density of nanofeatures and water droplet bouncing behavior on
the wing surfaces. The results of this research will contribute to
an understanding of the physical and chemical surface features that
are optimal for the design of antiwetting and antibacterial surfaces.

1 Introduction
The
epicuticle of dragonfly wings possesses nanoscale pillar arrays
that confer a number of desirable properties, such as superhydrophobicity,
self-cleaning ability, and antibacterial activity.1−4 The surfaces of these high-aspect
ratio nanopillars are composed primarily of aliphatic hydrocarbons
and palmitic acid and tend to cluster together in an irregular pattern.1,3,5 The unique combination of surface
chemistry and nanoarchitecture makes the wing surface superhydrophobic,
resulting in “self-cleaning” properties, where contaminants
are removed as water droplets roll off the surface.4,6 This
was initially thought to have evolved as an antifouling strategy,
preventing contamination of the wings with debris and microorganisms.7 Recently, it was discovered that these unique
nanostructures also display bactericidal activity against a broad
range of cells via a mechanism that causes rupturing of the cell membrane.1,8 Synthetic biomimetic surfaces that imitate this nanoarchitecture
have been shown to demonstrate similar superhydrophobicity, self-cleaning,
and bactericidal properties and hence show promise for medical and
industrial applications.8−13

The wings of insects have been of great interest across many
disciplines
as a flexible, strong, and lightweight material with unique aerodynamic
and antiwetting properties.14−17 Oh et al. conducted a comparison of the wings of
several cicada species across different habitats.18 The epicuticle of cicada wings contains nanopillars that
are shorter and exist in a more regular spatial arrangement on the
surface than those of dragonfly wings, but similarly display bactericidal
activity against a selective range of bacterial cells.2,19,20 The wings of dragonflies possess
similar antiwetting properties but exhibit a wider range of bactericidal
activity. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no systematic
studies performed that have compared the characteristics of dragonfly
wings across a broad range of species. Here, we present the surface
properties of the wings of different dragonfly species as a function
of the insects’ taxa, geography, habitat, and lifestyle characteristics
including migratory and foraging behaviors. The results of this research
will significantly contribute to an understanding of surface architectural
features that are optimal for the biomimetic design of surfaces where
microbial colonization is a concern.21

The nanoarchitecture and wettability of the dragonfly’s
wing epicuticle may vary because of different lifestyle requirements,
such as their feeding and migratory habits. For example, the foraging
behavior of a dragonfly can be classified by two main strategies.
“Hawkers” tend to remain in flight, patrolling their
territories, and hunting their prey from the air, whereas “perchers”
spend most of their time at rest, only taking flight once they spot
their prey.22,23 Hawkers, similar to migratory
species that spend long periods in flight, are likely to have developed
a lower requirement for a highly antifouling and antibacterial wing
epicuticle than perchers. It was also hypothesized that the opportunistic
species that inhabit still water and temporary pools such as ponds
or ditches have evolved to have decreased wing wettability compared
to those that prefer to inhabit fast running water environments. Insects
that inhabit still water environments tend to have short life cycles,
sometimes as little as 8–10 weeks from egg to adult, because
of the temporary nature of their homes. In contrast, riverine species
usually take more than a year to reach maturity.24

2 Results
2.1 Dragonfly Collection and
Scope of Study
Dragonfly species were collected from Melbourne,
Australia, and
the Baix Ebre and Terra Alta regions of Catalonia, Spain (Table 1). Seven species from
three families and two geographical locations were studied. Fourier-transform
infrared (FTIR) microspectroscopy was used to compare the chemical
composition of each wing membrane. The wettability of the wing surface
was determined through static water contact angles (WCAs) taken across
the wing surfaces as well as the analysis of high-speed videos of
bouncing water droplets. To investigate the wing surface nanoarchitecture,
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and tilted SEM images were analyzed.
These data were then correlated with the taxa, geography, habitat,
size, and migratory and foraging behaviors of the dragonfly species.

2.2 FTIR Microspectroscopic Analysis of Dragonfly
Wing
The infrared spectral maps of each wing sample were
obtained using focal plane array (FPA)-FTIR microspectroscopy (Figures 1 and S1). The spectra from each sample were broadly
similar, containing three major bands or band groups at 3480–3230,
3000–2800, 1750–1480 cm–1 which correspond
to hydroxyl, alkyl hydrocarbons, and ester carbonyl groups, respectively
(Figure S1).33−35 The presence of C–H
stretching bands, with a prevalence of methylene bands, indicate long-chain
aliphatic hydrocarbons typical of waxes.33,36 The spectra of all wings were dominated by amide I and amide II
absorption bands because of C=O bond stretching coupled to
N–H bending (1695–1610 cm–1) and C–N
stretching coupled to N–H bending (1575–1480 cm–1), respectively.35 The
presence of amide groups can be attributed to the chitin and protein
components of the wings, as they represent the major structural components
of the insect cuticle.

Figure 1 Chemical compositions of the wing membranes of seven species
of
dragonfly from three families, characterized through FTIR microspectroscopy.
(A) Austrothemis nigrescens, (B) Orthetrum chrysostigma, (C) Trithemis
annulata, (D) Sympetrum fonscolombii, (E) Anax parthenope, (F) Anax imperator, and (G) Onychogomphus
forcipatus. In the 2D contour plots, lipid and protein
distributions were determined through absorbance at the C=O
stretching band (1750–1720 cm–1) and amide
I band (1705–1600 cm–1), respectively. The
red areas represent higher absorbance in the bands and thus higher
concentrations, whereas the blue areas represent lower concentrations.
The three-dimensional (3D) contour plots of the lipid/protein ratio
show the areas of relatively higher lipid concentration in red and
areas of higher protein concentration in blue. Scale bars = 200 μm.

The two-dimensional (2D) spectral
maps of the dragonfly wings showed
spatial variations in the intensities of ester carbonyl (lipid component)
and amide I (protein component) peaks (Figure 1). The lipid and protein compositions of
the wing membrane were determined through FPA-FTIR. The lipid concentration
was indicated by the absorbance over the wavelength range 1750–1720
cm–1, which is the representative of the C=O
stretch of esters, whereas the protein concentration was determined
by the absorbance in the range 1705–1600 cm–1, which is representative of the amide I absorption band. The lipids/waxes
distributions were similar across the specimens, with the lower concentrations
being found in the wing veins, indicated in blue, compared to the
membranes (Figure 1). Microdomains that contained a high concentration of lipids/waxes,
represented in red, were observed in the membrane of Austrothemis nigrescens as well as Anax imperator (Figure 1A,F). Protein distribution was relatively
homogenous across each dragonfly wing specimen and inversely reflected
the lipid distribution with higher concentrations in the vein and
lower concentrations in the membrane. Microdomains of highly concentrated
protein regions were present in the Orthetrum chrysostigma sample (Figure 1A,B).

The C–H stretching region (2840–3000 cm–1) represented the symmetric (νs) and antisymmetric
(νas) stretching vibrations of CH2 and
CH3 functional groups. The presence of C–H stretching
bands with a prevalence of methylene bands in all seven dragonfly
wing samples indicated the presence of long-chain aliphatic hydrocarbons
(Figure S1).33,36 The intensity
of these C–H stretching bands, which provides an indication
of the amount of waxes present on the wings, was seen to vary between
species. The wings of T. annulata, Anax imperator, and Onychogomphus
forcipatus appeared to have the highest absorbance
within these bands, whereas Austrothemis nigrescens contained the lowest wax levels (Figure S1).

2.3 Surface Wettability
The wettability
of the wing surface of the seven dragonfly specimens was evaluated
via the measurement of receding WCAs across the wings (Figure 2). Wing surface WCA measurements
were reasonably consistent across all seven species and above the
accepted threshold for superhydrophobicity (>150°). A random
intercept model, generated using HLM (version 7.03), suggests that
interspecies variation accounts for only 9% of overall variation (Table S1).

species of dragonfly from
three families. WCAs were measured using a sessile drop at 17 points
across the wing surface. Figure created using OriginPro 2015 (OriginLab
Corporation, Northampton, MA).

2.4 Bouncing Droplet Behavior
Superhydrophobic
surfaces can cause water droplets coming into contact to bounce. On
rough surfaces, these droplets can undergo a phenomenon known as the
“pancake” bouncing.37,38 Pancake bouncing
occurs as droplets flatten and spread on impact with the surface before
lifting off in a flattened pancakelike shape. Droplets are classified
by the Q ratio, which is the ratio between the lateral
extension diameter of the droplet as it detaches from the surface
(djump) and the maximum diameter of water
droplet on the surface (dmax). Q > 0.8 indicates a pancake bounce.37−39

All specimens
exhibited the bouncing droplet behavior shown in Figure 3 and Movie S1–S7; however, total contact
time varied between species ranging from S. fonscolombii (13.4 ± 0.9 ms) to Austrothemis nigrescens (18.7 ± 1.4 ms) (Figure 3 and Table S2). The theoretical
contact time of a bouncing water droplet (τ) on a superhydrophobic
surface can be calculated using the properties of the water droplet
through the following equation40  where
ρ is the density of water, assumed
as 997 kg m–3 and γ is the surface tension
of water, accepted as 7.2 × 10−2 N m–1. R0 is the radius of the water droplet,
in this experiment, measured as 1.3 × 10–3 m.
Hence, the theoretical droplet contact time is calculated to be τ
= 5.5 ms. This value is much lower than the observed contact times
on the surface of the wings of all seven species of dragonflies (Table S2).

Figure 3 Bouncing water droplets on the wings of
seven species of dragonfly
from three families. Selected snapshots show the droplet morphology
over the course of one bounce at: the initial point of contact; when
the droplet reached maximum deformation on the wing surface; the last
point of contact; and at maximum rebound. The timestamps show how
many milliseconds it took to reach the displayed morphology after
the initial point of contact. The Q ratio represents
the degree of “pancaking”, with Q >
0.8 indicating a pancake bounce.

Most replicates exhibited directional droplet bouncing, however,
the direction was not consistent across the individual wing surface
with a combination of dorsal–ventral and anterior–posterior
directionality observed (Table S2). It
appeared that directionality of bounce was primarily affected by the
presence of nonuniform corrugations in the macrostructure of the wing,
causing ridges and valleys, which resulted in an angular bouncing
of the droplet.

It was found that there was a variation between
species in the
degree of pancake bouncing, with the T. annulata (Q = 0.926 ± 0.003) sample being the only
species that displayed true pancake bouncing above the accepted threshold Q > 0.8. The Anax parthenope sample showed near pancake bouncing (Q = 0.766
± 0.270). The Q values of the remaining dragonfly
specimens were below 0.7, indicating conventional bouncing, with the Anax imperator wing exhibiting the lowest value (Q = 0.458 ± 0.062).

2.5 Wing
Surface Nanoarchitecture
Top-view
and tilted SEM images determined the nanopillar height, diameter,
and density of nanofeatures and free-standing pillars for each dragonfly
wing sample (Figures 4 and S3). A wing surface nanoarchitecture
consisting of an irregular array of single and clustering nanopillars
was observed on all dragonflies (Figure 4). Average nanopillar height ranged from
236 ± 39 nm on the wing Onychogomphus forcipatus to 307 ± 34 nm on the wing of Austrothemis nigrescens (Figure S2A and Table S3). The diameter of the free-standing pillars were similar
across the seven individuals, ranging from 41 ± 5 nm on the wing
of S. fonscolombii to 51 ± 5 nm
on the wing of Orthetrum chrysostigma (Figure S2B and Table S3). The density of all nanopillars, clustered and free-standing,
was measured through ImageJ analysis and ranged from 47 ± 3 to
63 ± 4 (nanopillars/μm2) (Figure S3C and Table S3). These
measurements were compared to the sophisticated neural network analysis,
which isolated free-standing pillars, presenting a comparable trend
that suggests that the degree of pillar clustering was somewhat similar
across seven individuals (Figure S2C).

Figure 4 Top-view
(left) and tilted (right) images of nanopillar arrangements
on the wing epicuticle of seven species of dragonfly from three families.
(A) Austrothemis nigrescens, (B) Orthetrum chrysostigma, (C) T. annulata, (D) S. fonscolombii, (E) Anax parthenope, (F) Anax imperator, and (G) Onychogomphus forcipatus. Scale bar represents 200 nm (top-view) and 100 nm (tilted).

Statistical analysis using random
intercept models suggested interspecies
variance of nanopillar width and height accounted for only 25 and
34% of the total variation observed, respectively (Table S1). This relatively low percentage of overall variation
is partly because of the heterogeneous nature of the unique nanoarchitecture
as observable in the top-view SEM images (Figure 4). There was a large interspecies variation
between the density of nanofeatures, accounting for 77% of the overall
variance (Table S1). However, further exploratory
analysis found no significant relationship between the family, geographic
location, habitat, or migratory and foraging behaviors of the dragonfly
individuals and nanopillar width or height (Table S3).

3 Discussion
The relationship
between the taxonomy, geography, habitat preference,
and migratory and foraging behaviors of seven dragonfly species, inhabiting
Australian and European environments, and their corresponding surface
characteristics were determined. Infrared microspectroscopy, WCA analysis,
and droplet jumping behavior and SEM were used to characterize, respectively,
the chemistry, wettability, and nanoarchitecture of dragonfly wing
epicuticles.

The chemical compositions of the wing epicuticle
were reasonably
consistent across all seven species of dragonfly. The representative
spectra from each wing sample have clear C–H stretching bands,
with a prevalence of methylene bands (Figure S1), which indicate long-chain aliphatic hydrocarbons.33,36 These results align with previous reports that demonstrate the presence
of epicuticular waxes on the surface of dragonfly wings.3−5 2D and 3D contour maps showed that lipids/waxes were generally more
concentrated in the membrane sections, whereas the protein concentration
was greater on the veins of the wings (Figure 1). As these features were consistent across
all species tested, the key chemical components of the wings are likely
highly conserved, suggesting that the composition is important for
wing functionality. The conservation of the chemical compositions
is also important throughout the life of the dragonfly, as their wings
do not regenerate. They have been shown to possess remarkable stability,
remaining intact for up to 40 years.4 However,
the intensity of the C–H stretching bands varied between species,
indicating that the quantity of lipids/waxes present on the wings
varied between species. Additionally, subtle differences in the 2D
chemical distribution maps of the wing membrane region suggest that
the distribution is not homogenous.

The superhydrophobicity
of the wing surfaces was also found to
be well-conserved between all seven dragonfly species. No relationship
was found between wing wettability and taxonomy, habitat, and behavioral
and lifestyle traits of the dragonflies studied. This contradicts
our initial hypothesis and differs from similar work with cicadas,
which suggested a relationship between taxonomy and wettability.18 This further highlights the importance of the
antiwetting and self-cleaning properties of dragonflies’ wings
to their survival. This was seen in other insects with a high wing
surface/body mass ratio, where the accumulation of contaminants can
significantly hinder their flying abilities. The dragonflies’
unique wing surfaces likely evolved in an early ancestor, supported
by the similar wing surface nanoarchitecture found on the wing membrane
epicuticle of damselflies, a close relative of the dragonfly also
within the order Odonata.4,41

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine
droplet bouncing behavior on the surface of the dragonfly insect wings
consisting of nanopillars. The conserved superhydrophobicity across
all seven dragonfly specimens resulted in water droplet bouncing behavior
being present on all samples. One specimen, T. annulata, displayed true pancake bouncing above the accepted threshold, whereas
other wing surfaces ranged from clearly conventional bouncing to near
pancake bouncing. Droplet contact times were approximately threefold
longer than the calculated theoretical time and significantly higher
than synthetic surfaces that exhibit similar pancake bouncing behavior.37,38 This extended droplet contact time is likely a function of the dynamic
nature of the dragonfly wing surface which displays bending upon droplet
impact. Dragonfly wings are flexible and are able to rapidly deform,
allowing them to withstand stresses associated with flight.42,43 We propose that this flexibility may also help absorb the impact
of water droplets to the membrane, mitigating the risk of damage.
Comparatively, synthetic surfaces examined in previous droplet bouncing
studies are typically flat or uniformly angled with limited or no
flexibility in the macrostructure.37,38,40,44,45 While we focused on the wing surface nanoarchitecture in this study,
it is likely that interactions of macroscale features such as membrane
corrugations, veins, and microtrichia contribute to the behavior of
impacting water droplets. These findings warrant further work to understand
more about this complex natural system.

The unique pattern of
nonuniform, irregularly organized nanopillars
was present on all seven dragonfly species studied. Surprisingly,
the height and peak width of the nanopillars were very similar across
all individuals despite the seemingly random organization. The density
of peaks did differ between species, which reflects the observable
differences in nanostructured patterns when viewing top-view SEM images
(Figure 4); however,
these changes appeared unrelated to lifestyle or behavioral factors.
Interestingly, it has previously been demonstrated that wing macrostructures
similarly do not correlate with the preference for still or flowing
water habitats.46 Whereas the wings of
migratory dragonfly species have been shown to differ in macrostructure,
possessing an extra lobe and generally being larger and smoother than
nonmigratory species.16,47

It should be noted that
the dragonfly species studied here were
represented by only one individual, and therefore this study serves
as an initial work to highlight possible relationships between the
dragonfly wing epicuticle properties, including their chemical composition,
wettability and nanoarchitecture, and the dragonfly characteristics.
The results presented here should be revisited in future studies as
more information becomes available regarding the unique surface properties
of dragonfly wings.

4 Conclusions
This
work provides a systematic study of seven species of dragonfly
collected from Australia and Europe. Various lifestyle and physiological
characteristics were considered for their potential relationships
with various wing epicuticle properties, including chemical composition,
wettability, and nanoarchitecture. Overall, there were no clear and
outstanding correlations between lifestyle or wing surface characteristics.
We found that the unique arrays of nanopillars on the waxy epicuticular
layer of the wings were present in all studied species and that the
chemical composition of this layer was consistent between different
wing samples. The resultant superhydrophobicity was well-conserved,
suggesting that this unique nanoarchitecture likely evolved in an
early ancestor because of the importance of the antiwetting and self-cleaning
properties to dragonfly survival. Despite the conservation of wing
membrane chemistry and hydrophobicity, there were slight differences
in droplet contact behavior which may reflect variance in wing macrostructures.
The height and width of the nanopillars were relatively similar, whereas
the density appeared to differ between species. This study provides
a framework for future research in the emerging field of bio-inspired
design of surfaces and may support the development of antiwetting
surfaces for use in biomedicine, infrastructure, aviation, and marine
design applications.

5 Materials and Methods
5.1 Dragonfly Collection and Sample Preparation
Seven species
of dragonfly were collected from Melbourne, Australia,
and the Baix Ebre and Terra Alta regions of Catalonia, Spain (Table 1). The wings of each
specimen were removed from the body aseptically and stored under dark
conditions at room temperature (ca. 22 °C) in sterile polystyrene
Petri dishes (Techno Plas) until required. The distal-posterior regions
of the forewings were dissected into approximately 5 mm × 5 mm
squares using a sterile surgical blade.

5.2 Scanning
Electron Microscopy
High-resolution
scanning electron micrographs were obtained at 3 kV under 20 000×,
40 000×, and 70 000× magnification using a
Zeiss SUPRA 40VP field-emission SEM (Carl Zeiss NTS GmbH, Oberkochen,
BW, Germany). Wing samples were coated with thin gold films of 7.5
nm in thickness, according to the manufacturer’s instructions,
using a MP-19020NCTR NeoCoater, before viewing with the microscope.
Wing excavation was performed using a FEI Helios NanoLab 600 focused
ion beam scanning electron microscope, with a 30 kV Ga+ ion beam at a current of 9.7 pA and under a vacuum of 1 × 10–3 Pa.

Scanning electron micrographs were analyzed
using ImageJ software (version 1.50i). The color threshold for binary
SEM images was adjusted and the particles were analyzed. Particles
with a diameter below 30 nm were removed as artefacts. The nanofeature
density, inclusive of free-standing and clustering nanopillars, was
determined using particle analysis, with measurements taken over six
regions, 1.5 μm × 2 μm in area, on each of the wing
surface for each dragonfly. The density of free-standing nanopillars
was determined through neural network analysis as previously described.48

Nanopillar tip diameters were measured
manually using ImageJ software
because an automated approach was found to be unsuitable because of
the natural bending and clustering of the nanopillars. The width of
17 nanopillars across three regions of the wing was measured for each
dragonfly. The height of nanopillars was determined by tilting the
samples at a 45° angle, with images being obtained using the
high-resolution SEM capabilities of the electron beam lithography
tool (RAITH150 Two, Raith GmBH) at 5 kV. The height of seventeen nanopillars
over two sections of the wing were measured for each dragonfly. Images
were captured at the magnification levels previously stated.

5.3 IR Microspectroscopy
The dragonfly
wings were cut into rectangular sections using a surgical blade. Sections
were then fixed between aluminum support frames using polyimide (Kapton)
tape to fix both sides of the section ready for subsequent spectral
data collection. FPA-FTIR spectral images of the dragonfly wings were
acquired using the Infrared Microspectroscopy Beamline, Australian
Synchrotron (Clayton, Australia) and a Bruker HYPERION 2000 FTIR microscope
(Bruker Optik GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany), equipped with a liquid-N2 cooled 64 × 64 element FPA detector and a 15× objective
lens (NA = 0.4), which was coupled to a Vertex 70/70v FTIR spectrometer
with an internal Globar IR source (Bruker Optik GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany).
The spectra were collected in transmission mode within a 4000–800
cm–1 spectral region as a single FTIR image covering
a sampling area of 170 μm × 170 μm. Each FTIR spectral
image comprises a 32 × 32 array of spectra resulting from binning
the signal from each square of four detectors on the 64 × 64
element FPA array. As a consequence, a single spectrum from each FTIR
image represented the chemical information acquired from ca. 5.4 μm
× 5.4 μm area on the wing membrane.

For each wing
section, high-quality FTIR spectral images were collected at 4 cm–1 resolution with 64 coadded scans. Blackman-Harris
3-term apodization, power-spectrum phase correction, and a zero-filling
factor of 2 were set as the default acquisition parameters using OPUS
7.2 imaging software suite (Bruker). Background measurements were
taken prior to sample spectral images, by focusing the beam through
an air gap between the wing sections under the same acquisition parameters.
The lipid and protein distribution present in the wing samples were
approximated by integrating the ester carbonyl stretching band (1720–1750
cm–1) and amide I band (1705–1600 cm–1), respectively, using the OPUS software.

5.4 WCA Measurements
The surface wettability
of the wings was examined by measuring the receding WCA, using the
sessile drop method, at the point prior to droplet elongation as the
tip was drawn away from the surface. The contact angle measurements
were carried out in air using an FTA1000c equipped with a nanodispenser
(First Ten Ångstroms, Inc., Portsmouth, VA, USA). Seventeen measurements
were taken across the entire surface of each dragonfly forewing. Measurements
where the water droplet adhered to the surface of the wing were excluded,
as this likely resulted because of wing damage.

5.5 Bouncing Droplet Behavior
Bouncing
water droplets were studied using a Phantom v2512 high-speed camera
at 28 000 fps and 768 × 768 resolution. Droplets were
released 13 mm above the wing surfaces at room temperature using an
FTA1000c equipped with a nanodispenser (First Ten Ångstroms,
Inc., USA). Water droplet volume was 9.6 ± 0.8 μL, with
a diameter of approximately 2.6 ± 0.08 mm. The droplet bouncing
behavior was characterized as pancake or conventional bouncing. This
was determined by calculating the ratio (Q) between
the lateral extension diameter of the droplet as it detached from
the surface (djump) and the maximum diameter
of the water droplet on the surface (dmax), where Q > 0.8 indicated a pancake bounce.37−39 The Weber number was determined for each sample using the equation We = ρv2r0/γ, where ρ is the liquid density, v is the impact velocity, r0 is the droplet radius, and γ is the surface tension. For all
our experiments, We = 9.26 ± 0.27.

5.6 Statistical Analysis
SPSS version
25 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) was used to test WCA and nanopillar height,
diameter, and density measures for normality using Q–Q plots of the residuals. Hierarchical linear
modelling was performed using the student edition of HLM version 7.03
(Scientific Software International, Skokie, IL), with individual measurements
as level 1 data and species as level 2 data. The family was recoded
as binary variables so that each of the three families was compared
to the combination of the other two families. A random intercept model
was used to assess the proportion of variation attributed to interspecies
differences. An exploratory analysis was used to identify possible
level 2 predictors by t values. Where t values approached ±2, p values from a final
estimation of fixed effects were considered to evaluate the likelihood
of a relationship. It is worth noting that this study was limited
with regard to sample sizes. Each dragonfly species was represented
by a single individual. The variation and imperfections inherent in
this type of natural surface also meant that the nanopillar height
and diameter had to be measured manually; therefore, a limited number
of measurements were included.
