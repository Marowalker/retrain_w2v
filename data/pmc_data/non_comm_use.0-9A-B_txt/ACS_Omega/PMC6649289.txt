Low emissions and high efficiencies
can be realized in combustion
systems that operate at high-pressure and low-temperature conditions
(high densities). The design of such engines relies on accurate models
of the physical processes involved. Under these conditions, the ideal
gas model widely used in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations
fails to properly capture the relation among pressure, density, and
temperature as well as inter-relations among other thermodynamic and
transport properties. As such, discrepancies between experimental
observations and CFD simulations cannot only be traced to uncertainties
from experiments, turbulent, or combustion models. This paper offers
a possible solution to the implementation of the real gas equation
of state models in combustion simulations. The large number of species
in combustion simulations requires effort to provide the relevant
real gas properties. A method is suggested for incorporating these
properties in simulations based on available transport and thermodynamic
data of chemical kinetic models. This attempt also brings out an often-ignored
problem in existing chemical kinetic models in the literature, namely,
the nonsystematic assignment of transport properties for various species.
To clearly demonstrate the need for real gas models in reacting flows,
simulations are carried out of a high-pressure n-heptane
jet into a quiescent chamber of air based on ideal gas and real gas
models. The defects of the ideal gas model are revealed, and the proposed
method of property estimation is justified as a convenient solution.

1 Introduction
Advanced combustion systems
characterized by high efficiencies
and low emissions can be realized by organizing combustion processes
at high pressures and low or moderate temperature conditions. For
example, modern diesel engines with turbo chargers reach pressures
at about 100 atm; gas turbines now approach 50 atm at take off; and
rocket engines operate around 200–300 atm. Combustion systems
under these conditions require real gas models.

The need to
account for real gas effects in computational fluid
dynamics (CFD) simulations has been recognized, with the result that
increasingly more studies try to address this problem.1−10 Recent comprehensive reviews of work on real gas behavior in reacting
flows have been presented by Bellan11 Sazhin12 and Yang.13 These
works established that the fluid flow is different once either pressure
or temperature exceeds the critical state values. In addition to all
of the classical problems of multiphase chemically reacting flows,
a unique set of problem arises from the introduction of thermodynamic
nonidealities and transport anomalies. Models of real gas behavior
are needed.

There are many models of real gas equations of state
used in CFD.
These include theoretically grounded equations, such as the van der
Waals equation. Complex empirical equations of state are also used,
including the 32-term version of the Benedict–Webb–Rubin
(BWR) equation.14,15 Most practical real gas equation
of state (EOS) is modifications of the semi-empirical van der Waals
EOS. Currently, in order to simplify computational tasks associated
with EOS evaluations, two-term cubic equations of state such as the
Redlich–Kwong (RK) model,16 Soave–Redlich–Kwong
(SRK),17 and Peng–Robinson (PR)18 are widely used for research projects. These
models should also bridge the vapor and liquid states.

Vapor–liquid
equilibrium processes of n-alkanes from C2 to C20 were presented by Zhu
and Reitz19 to examine the effects of real
gas EOS. It was found that the PR and SRK EOS were superior to the
RK EOS in predicting nonideal gas properties.

Real gas effects
in nonreacting flow simulations can be described
in mixing problems. In this area, Yang’s group20,21 and Bellan’s research group4,22,23 have carried out several simulation studies. Oefelein
and Yang20 used large eddy simulation (LES)
to study the 2D mixing of hydrogen and oxygen. Choices for real gas
behavior were the 32-term BWR EOS14 proposed
by Jacobsen and Stewart24 near critical
points and the SRK real gas model elsewhere.25 Bellan’s team4,22,23 opted for the PR EOS in direct numerical simulation and the LES
study of high-pressure mixing layers.

Apart from nonreacting
flows, real gas effects have been included
in several reacting flow simulations with simplified chemistry models.26−33 The consideration of real gas effects resulted in the change of
the flow structure and development of the flow. Kim et al.30 simulated a liquid rocket reacting flow, where
liquid oxygen (83 K) and gaseous hydrogen (275 K) were introduced
to a combustion chamber at 6.0 MPa. The simulation used a modified
SRK EOS and consistent thermodynamics along with a real fluid flamelet
model, formulated in a mixture fraction space. The real-fluid flamelet
was found to be capable of realistically predicting the overall characteristics
of a turbulent nonpremixed GH2/LOx flame at supercritical pressures.

With the need to include
more chemical kinetic effects in combustion
simulations, one encounters a high number of species whose critical
properties are not well known or would be too cumbersome to be assigned
manually. It is preferable that any method used to address this problem
be computationally convenient.

This paper develops a framework
to generate parameters of real
gas EOS from transport and thermodynamics data, which are available
and are already used in combustion chemical kinetic models.34 We first describe the method to obtain required
real gas EOS parameters from chemical kinetic models and their associated
data.35,36 We further highlight an existing problem
in the way current transport data are estimated because significant
differences are observed. Thereafter, we demonstrate through simulations
that using real gas EOS leads to differences in the flow field at
combustion-relevant conditions, compared to simulations based on ideal
gas EOS. As further justification for the proposed solution, we review
the theoretical link between EOS parameters and transport properties,
namely, their relation to intermolecular potentials.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Method of EOS Parameter
Estimation
Our goal is to determine for each species in a
given mechanism its
real gas EOS parameters, that is, Tc, Pc, and ω. Using an appropriate mixing
rule, the EOS parameters for a given combustion gas mixture can be
determined from those of the individual species. As mentioned before,
for reacting flow simulation, there is a connection between the critical
state properties and the parameters of intermolecular potentials.
The latter are used in combustion flows to generate required transport
properties (viscosity, conductivity, and thermal diffusivity). One
can reverse-engineer the transport data to obtain the critical state
parameters needed for the EOS. Many empirical relations between parameters
of intermolecular potentials and the critical state properties have
been proposed as reviewed by Tee et al.37 Some of these require knowledge of the acentric factor while others
do not. The most widely used of these
equations are in the form (Table 1) 1   2  where
ε is the depth of the potential
well and σ is the distance at which the potential is zero.

Table 1 Parameters for Estimation
Methods	Tee et
al.37	Kee et al.38	Holley et al.39	
aσ	2.3551	2.393	2.3551	
bσ	0.0874	0	0.3955	
aε	0.7915	0.75	0.8063	
bε	0.1693	0	0.6802	
In
chemical kinetic models, the estimation rules proposed in Kee
et al.38 are often used. It appears that
the Tee et al.37 performed better than
the Kee et al.38 when predicted transport
variables are compared with empirical observations. Tc, Pc,and ω are observable
or experimentally derivable quantities whereas the accuracy of σ
and ε can only be inferred from their prediction of transport
properties. This circularity can lead to a verification problem. Holley
et al.39 have suggested updated coefficients
for the Tee correlation. This means that with an appropriate correlation,
one can obtain Tc and Pc from transport data, as far as consistency in applied
estimating σ, ε from properties, and reverse calculation
of those properties from σ, ε.

The acentric factor,
ω, poses a challenge that can only be
resolved through structure–activity correlations. For instance,
for alkanes, it can established that ω depends on the number
of carbon (Nc):40 ω = 0.004423[ln(3.3063 + 3.4381Nc)]3.651. The necessary carbon number can be obtained from
the model thermodynamic data file. Taken together, the above offers
ways to generate critical state properties and hence EOS parameters
from currently available resources.

One might check the effectiveness
of the proposed approach by comparing
predicted critical state parameters with measured data for some species
of relevance to combustion. An example is shown in Figure 1 for C1–C12 n-alkanes with critical properties from the literature.25 Intermolecular potential parameters σ
and ε are chosen from the JetSurF 2.0 mechanism36 and LLNL n-heptane mechanism, respectively.
The observed differences in Tc and Pc trace back to differences in the transport
data σ and ε, which are often not given critical attention
in model evaluations.

(a,b) are estimated Tc and Pc based on Tee’s method; (c,d) are estimated Tc and Pc based on
Kee’s method; (e,f) are estimated Tc and Pc based on Holley’s method.

As shown in Figure 1, Tee’s correlation with the LLNL
chemical kinetic database
provides accurate critical properties. While for large carbon alkanes,
Holley’s correlation with JetSurF 2.0 shows good agreement
with experimental data, for small carbon alkanes, the correlation
results in inconsistency. Kee’s correlation does not require
an acentric factor but errors occur as the carbon number increases
because of deviation from the spherical shape. Therefore, we recommend
using Tee’s correlation with the LLNL database. This correlation
can still be used with other databases. The methodical differences
are still insignificant compared to using the ideal gas model at high-density
conditions.

2.3 LES of n-Heptane Jets
The problem we consider here consists
of an n-heptane
jet introduced into a hot chamber of air to investigate the effect
of real gas models on CFD simulations of mixing. Two different types
of inlet conditions, which are kept constant for simulations, are
used. In the first case, we keep the inlet velocity of 86 m/s using
both ideal gas EOS and real gas EOS. In the second case, the momentum
is the same, thus, when the ideal gas EOS velocity is 86 m/s, the
real gas velocity is reduced to 53.73 m/s to obtain the same momentum
because of the density difference.

The conditions are such that
the chamber filled with air at 50 atm has a temperature of 1050 K.
The subsonic n-heptane jet is injected with a temperature
of T = 575 K. Simulations are carried out using both
ideal gas EOS and real gas (PR) EOS for species. The real gas EOS
requires the critical state parameters and acentric factor, which
for n-heptane are Tc =
540.15 K, Pc = 27.36 bar, and ω
= 0.349; for oxygen are Tc = 154.58 K, Pc = 50.43 bar, and ω = 0.025; and for
nitrogen are Tc = 126.20 K, Pc = 34.00 bar, and ω = 0.039.

In order to
properly resolve the flow field, the turbulence model
chosen here is LES with wall-adapting local eddy as the subgrid scale
model. To simulate the combustion flow field, the eddy-break up model
is employed. The mesh consists of 2 393 042 cells in
total with a minimum cell size Δxmin = 0.1 mm. Simulation is carried out using the segregated solver
of Star-CCM+. The time discretization is implicit, and to obtain good
convergence of the solver at each time step, the following under-relaxation
factors were used, 0.8 for velocity, 0.2 for pressure, and 0.9 for
both the species and energy equations. A maximum of 50 iterations
for the iterative matrix solvers was used to ensure the solution reached
a converged state at each time step. The time step was set to a maximum
local CFL number of approximately 2.4.

2.3.1 Case
1: Inlet Speed the Same
The
resulting flow field can be compared using scalars such as the temperature
and Q-criterion as a measure of vorticity. Figure 3 is the instantaneous
temperature profile with a nonreacting flow. The spread and penetration
depth of the flow are different between ideal gas and real gas with
PR EOS, predicting a further propagated flow. Similar flow pattern
could be found in the reacting case, as shown in Figure 4. With the combustion model,
the flow contains higher energy, hence, the difference is more pronounced.
The temperature fields also reflect differences that align with the
mixing field. These fields are affected through the use of the EOS
to relate the pressure, density, and temperature, which appear in
the conservation equations.

Instantaneous snapshots of the
jet dynamics at two different instances
in time are shown in Figure 5 through isosurfaces of the Q-criterion colored
with temperature. The Q-criterion is an appropriate
quantity to visualize coherent structures from LES. Coherent structures
in the form of horseshoe vortices are visible at the edge of the jet.
These structures contain a major fraction of the energy. As a result
of the lower chemistry of the ideal gas, low momentum is injected
into the flow compared to the case of the real gas. This leads to
lower energy content and faster dissipation of coherent structures
in ideal gas.

× 108). (a,b) Ideal gas model, (c,d) real gas model;
nonreacting results are on the top and reacting results are at the
bottom. Colored by temperature in [K] at 1 ms.

Similar behavior is observed between nonreacting and reacting
flow,
where the combustion model generates more turbulent energy and coupled
with the higher momentum, the real gas case reaches to a stronger
coherent structure.

These differences have implications on the
interpretation of experimental
data used for validation. It must be justified whether the inlet conditions
are estimated based on assumption of a given EOS.

2.3.2 Case 2: Flow-Field Comparison for the Same
Inlet Mass Flow Rate
From Figure 4, we see that the choice of EOS in the simulation
of high-pressure combustion systems, such a fuel injection is important
to the prediction of the flow field. Using a constant velocity boundary
condition with the real gas and ideal gas EOS models results in difference
in the penetration depth, with the real gas jet going further. This
occurs because of the differences in the inlet momentum of the two
jets. An interesting question would be to see whether the penetration
depth be made similar by prescribing the same momentum for the two
cases. This would validate the explanation for the differences in Figure 4.

In Figures 6 and 7, we compare the results from real gas and ideal gas EOS simulations
in which the inlet jet mass flow rate is held fixed at 0.1 kg/s. Because
of the higher density of the real gas EOS prediction, the inlet velocity
is low, requiring more time to reach the same penetration depth.

2.3.3 Case
3: Flow-Field Comparison for the Same
Inlet Momentum
From Figure 4, we see that the choice of EOS in the simulation of
high-pressure combustion systems, such a fuel injection is important
to the prediction of the flow field. Using a constant velocity boundary
condition with the real gas and ideal gas EOS models results in difference
in the penetration depth, with the real gas jet going further. This
occurs because of the differences in the inlet momentum of the two
jets. An interesting question would be to see whether the penetration
depth be made similar by prescribing the same momentum for the two
cases. This would validate the explanation for the differences in Figure 4.

In Figures 8 and 9, we compare the results from real gas and ideal gas EOS simulations
in which the inlet jet momentum is held fixed. Because of the higher
density of the real gas EOS prediction, the inlet velocity is low,
requiring more time to reach the same penetration depth.

temperature contours at 1 ms. Top: ideal gas; bottom: real gas.

Figure 9 Q-criterion isosurface (Q = 5
× 105). Colored by temperature in [K] at 1 ms. Reacting

bottom: real gas.

The above discussion
brings to light another problem that must
be considered in the simulation of physical problems or experiments,
the errors that can occur due to boundary conditions. For experiments
of fuel injection, the injection boundary conditions would be specified
either as a measured mass flow rate or a velocity. The boundary condition
would then be interpreted by the numerical modeler and adjusted to
velocity or the mass flow rate to fit with the numerical model of
the experiment. In a high-pressure combustion simulation, the careful
interpretation of these boundary conditions and the EOS assumptions
that have been made during the measurement is important to the comparison
of experiment and computation.

The observed differences in the
flow field thus justify the need
for real gas models. The method of estimating these real gas model
parameters from available resources is a convenient solution.

3 Conclusions
In this paper, the problem of
real gas equations of state for high-density
flow simulations is considered. The importance of such equations of
state is underlined by comparing the LES results of a n-heptane jet into an air vessel realized using LES with ideal and
real gas equations of state. It is then suggested that parameters
of a cubic EOS, namely, the critical state variables, can be determined
from the transport data of chemical kinetic models. It is further
observed that the transport data of various chemical kinetic models
are not necessarily consistent, suggesting further attention to this
modeling problem.

4 Computational Methods
This paper presented a solution to real gas model parameter estimations.
This section sketches the theoretical background to the estimation
approach. It first shows how real gas effects enter into CFD simulation.
It then discusses EOS models and intermolecular potentials.

4.1 Real Gas Effects in CFD Modeling and Analysis
Accurate
determination of density and other thermodynamic properties
based on the EOS is very important because CFD governing equations
are sensitive to these. The index notation form of the governing equations
for chemically reacting flows is 3   4   5   6  

The density deviation
of the ideal
gas law cannot be ignored at high-density conditions because it can
be large as shown in Figure 10. The ideal gas law deviation of density increases when the
carbon number becomes larger, while the real gas equations of state
provide good agreements with experimental data. PR and RK seem to
do comparably well over a range of conditions. When it comes to large
hydrocarbon fuels, the SRK seems to be preferred.17 The PR and RK can be recommended, unless special considerations
demand use of more complex RG EOS.

Figure 10 Variation of n-propane
and n-heptane
density with temperature (at P = 50 atm), highlighting
importance of real gas EOS.

Thermodynamic properties are generally taken as the sum of
values
provided by the ideal gas model and a departure function accounting
for the real gas effects. The difference in flow patterns can be induced
by the departure function in internal energy or enthalpy 7   8  where
the second terms are the departure terms. While the ideal gas EOS
will result in zero for the departure term, real gas EOS contributes
to the overall function. Therefore, the energy function would be slightly
different for the two EOS, and eventually causing the variation in
the flow field.

4.2 Modeling Real Gas EOS
Semiempirical
cubic equations of state for real gases are used widely in combustion
simulation projects because of their simplicity. For a pure compound,
the cubic EOS requires critical properties, Tc and Pc as input, while some of
the equations need the acentric factor, ω. By applying certain
mixing rules, one can obtain the EOS parameters for the multispecies
mixture.

According to Zhu and Reitz,19 the general form of cubic equations of state can be written as 9  where V is the volume of
a system and R is the universal gas constant; q and w are constants depending on the
type of cubic EOStbl. For pure species, a and b are functions of temperature. The expressions for EOS
parameters are presented in Table 2, where Tc and Pc are critical temperature and critical pressure,
ω is the acentric factor, and κ is a constant that depends
on the acentric factor and the reduced temperature, Tr = T/Tc.

Table 2 Parameters for Cubic EOS
Equation
name	b	a	q	w	
RK	  	  	1	0	
SRK	  	  	1	0	
 	 	κ = (0.480 + 1.574ω
– 0.176ω2)	 	 	
PR	  	  	2	–1	
 	 	κ = 0.37464 + 1.54226ω
– 0.26992ω2	 	 	
For multispecies
systems, a binary mixing rule with regard to a and b is suggested by Peng and Robinson18 as 10  where δij is an empirically determined binary interaction
coefficient, characterizing
the binary interaction formed by component i and
component j. δij is observed to lie between −0.2 and 0.2 and in majority binary
mixtures, it is postulated to be 0.0.41

Another method to deal with the mixing rule is the pseudocritical
method based on the corresponding state principle (CSP). To obtain
an EOS, we first calculate the pseudocritical properties for the mixture.
According to Poling et al.,25 the pseudocritical
temperature Tcm can be estimated by the
simplest mole fraction average method:42Tcm = ∑i=1nyiTci. As for the pseudocritical pressure, Pcm, a mole fraction average of pure-component critical
pressures is normally unsatisfactory. This is because the critical
pressure for most systems goes through a maximum or minimum with composition.
The only exceptions are if all components of the mixture have similar
critical pressures or critical volumes. The simplest rule which can
give acceptable Pcm values for two-parameter
or three-parameter CSP is the modified rule of Prausnitz and Gunn43 11  where
all of the mixture pseudocriticals Zcm, Tcm, and Vcm are given by mole fraction averages and R is the
universal gas constant.

The mixture pseudo acentric factor is
commonly given by a mole
fraction average44 12  

Thus, with knowledge of the critical temperature and critical
pressure
of each species, the EOS for the mixture is determined.

4.3 Intermolecular Potentials and Combustion Modeling
For
ideal gases, it is usual to assume elastic collision to be
such that no interacting forces are felt beyond a characteristic separation r > σ, but the potential is infinite for r ≤ σ, necessitating bounce off. Ideal gases
hold that
most of the time, gaseous particles are sufficiently far apart such
that no forces are felt except during collision. The situation changes
in dense fluids.

In real fluids, particles interact with others
according to an intermolecular potential which is a superposition
of nuclei–electrons attraction and electrons–electrons
or nuclei–nuclei repulsion. Various modeling approaches exist
for describing the potential in interacting systems, from the simplest
model rigid impenetrable spheres to complicated four-parameter Buckingham
potential. The most widely used Lennard-Jones 6-12 potential is defined
as45 13  where ε is the potential energy depth,
and σ is the distance at which the interparticle potential is
zero. These parameters are illustrated in Figure 11.

Figure 11 Lennard-Jones Potential.46

In combustion simulations
involving chemical kinetic models, Lennard-Jones
potential parameters are widely used to determine transport properties,
such as the viscosity, thermal conductivity, and diffusion coefficient,
because these transport processes are grounded in the momentum exchange
of particles.34

The viscosity of
a simple coefficient is given by47 14  where mi is the molecular mass, kB is the
Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and σk is the Lennard-Jones collision diameter.

The thermal conductivity can be obtained from 15  where A is a constant and Cv,i is the
specific heat capacity at constant volume for species i.

The binary diffusion coefficient for species i and j is defined as48 16  Ω1,1* and
Ω2,2* are dimensionless collision integrals as a
function of , which have been provided by Monchick and
Mason.49

Thus, with knowledge of
σ and ε of each species, the
transport properties are fully determined.

4.4 Real
Gas EOS and Lennard-Jones Potential
The widely used two-term
cubic equations of state such as the RK
model, (SRK) and PR require the critical properties of chemical species.

The critical and phase change properties of a fluid reflect the
nature of intermolecular interactions. A direct theoretical connection
or correlation has been sought to link critical state parameters to
molecular dynamics. Therefore, real gas properties have been investigated
by many groups using molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations,
starting with Wood and Parker.50 Verlet51 later used the Lennard-Jones potential to study
the EOS of a fluid. Subsequently, an accurate EOS database was compiled
by Nicolas et al.52 After many more studies,
the EOS was refitted by Johnson et al.53 Frenkel and Smit54 used the Monte Carlo
simulation to predict the results from Johnson et al.,53 including the vapor–liquid coexistence
region. Traditionally, the Lennard-Jones potential is used to model
hard-core neutral atoms or spherical molecules. With the development
of the statistical-associated fluid theory,55 the Lennard-Jones EOS was analytically studied for hard-core homo-nuclear
chain molecules.56,57 Chen et al.58 extended the theory into pure and binary n-alkane systems and presented an accurate estimation of phase equilibrium.

With accurate description of the molecular interactions, it is
therefore possible to predict real gas behavior. The connection between
Lennard-Jones potentials of spherical molecules and their critical
properties can be explored using Monte Carlo simulations. However
for more practical applications, semiempirical relations are needed
for rapid estimation of state properties from molecular potential
parameters.

For each species in a given chemical kinetic model,
its real gas
EOS parameters, that is, Tc, Pc, ω, can therefore be estimated. Using an appropriate
mixing rule, the EOS parameters for a given combustion gas mixture
can then be determined from those of the individual species. As mentioned
before, for reacting flow simulation, there is a connection between
the critical state properties and the parameters of intermolecular
potentials. The latter are used in combustion flows to generate required
transport properties (viscosity, conductivity, and thermal diffusivity).
One can therefore reverse-engineer the transport data to obtain the
critical state parameters needed for the EOS, as done in Section 2.
