Recently,
semiconducting and other extraordinary properties of
the monolayer of the V-group element have attracted a broad interest
and attention. The success of experimentally growing antimonene and
black phosphorus makes the arsenic monolayer a reasonable candidate
for two-dimensional semiconductors. By using DFT calculation, we investigate
the vibrational properties and Raman spectra of the buckled honeycomb
monolayer of arsenic (β-As) for four commonly used laser lines.
By calculating Raman tensor of each active modes of the β-As
monolayer, we obtained polarization angle-dependent Raman intensities
when the wave vector of incident light is parallel and perpendicular
with the plane of the β-As monolayer. We found that the nonresonant
Raman spectra have two peaks at 235 and 305 cm–1 that correspond to the in-plane vibrating mode Eg and
out-of-plane vibrating mode A1g, which is similar to germanene,
blue phosphorene, and β-Sb monolayer Raman spectra. There are
two (four) minima and two (four) maxima when the polarization direction
of scattered light is parallel (perpendicular) to that of the incident
light and the wave vector of the incident light is parallel to the
β-As monolayer. The Raman intensities of neither parallel polarization
configuration nor perpendicular polarization configuration depend
on the polarization direction when the wave vector of incident light
is perpendicular to the β-As monolayer. The relation between
shapes of the polar plots and relative values of Raman tensor elements
is found. The Raman intensities decrease with increasing wavelength
of incident laser lines in most cases. Our results will help experimentalists
to identify the existence and the orientation of the β-As monolayer
while they are growing the β-As monolayer.

Introduction
Recently, few-layered structures of group-V
element have attracted
much attention in the nanoelectronic and optoelectronic fields. Black
phosphorene, a monolayer of phosphorus atoms, is a popular member
of this group because of having extraordinary properties such as direct
moderate band gap,1 high carrier mobility,2 and anisotropic3 transport
properties. Blue phosphorene is another allotrope of phosphorene.
The growth of blue phosphorene on Au(111) was reported by using a
molecular beam epitaxial, in 2016.4 The
high thermal conductivity5,6 and large band gap of
blue phosphorene are one of the features that makes it a good suggestion
for the electronic industry.7,8 Lei et al. succeeded
to experimentally grow antimonene, which is another member of group-V,
on Bi2Te3 and Sb2Te3.9 Comparing with group IV (graphene,10 silicene,11 etc.),
this group has a large band gap in their few layer structures, that
is, an indispensable feature in electronic applications.

The
gray arsenic, yellow arsenic, and black arsenic are the three
common allotropes of arsenic.12 The bulk
of gray arsenic is semimetal. The existence of monolayer and bilayer
of gray arsenic has been predicted because of its weak interlayer
interaction.13−15 The band gap of gray arsenic changes from ∼0.175
to ∼2.49 eV when its thickness decreases from bulk to monolayer.16−18 The buckled and puckered honeycomb structures are two stable monolayers
of arsenic that are also called β-arsenene and α-arsenene,
respectively. The α-arsenene was predicted13,19 to be a semiconducting material with a direct band gap and has high
carrier mobility20 and strong anisotropy.20 The structure of β-arsenene with an indirect
band gap is similar to that of the layered blue phosphorus; this structure
is a little more stable than that of α-arsenene.13 The investigated optical properties show that
β-arsenene could be very useful in various photovoltaic and
optoelectronic applications.14

Although
few-layer arsenic has not been experimentally studied
yet,13 the success of growing antimonene,9 black phosphorene,21 and blue phosphorene4 makes arsenic monolayers
plausible candidates for two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors.

Up to now, there is not any study about vibrational properties
and Raman spectra of the β-As monolayer, which is essential
for the experimentalists to investigate the electronic and thermal
properties of graphene and beyond,22 and
to identify the β-As monolayer when experimentalists are trying
to grow it. Raman spectroscopy is also possible to determine the pressure
by measuring the blue shift of Raman optical modes.23 In this work, we investigated vibrational properties of
the β-As monolayer, based on the density functional theory (DFT)
calculation. We calculated Raman tensor and thus the polarization
direction-dependent Raman intensities of the β-As monolayer
with four commonly used laser lines (532, 633, 830, and 785 nm).

Results
and Discussion
The phonon dispersion curve (Figure 1b) of the β-As monolayer
(Figure 1a) shows that
there is no imaginary vibrating
mode which means that the β-As monolayer has the dynamic stability.
There are 3 optical modes. All of them are Raman active. The phonon
dispersion is similar to those of blue phosphorene24 and β-antimonene.25 Our
result also agrees with the previous work.19

(buckled monolayer arsenic), (b) Phonon dispersions of β-As
monolayer, and (c) Raman active modes A1g (out-of-plane)
and Eg (in-plane) at Γ point.

The β-As monolayer belongs to the D3d point
group,
whose Raman active modes are A1g and Eg (doubly
degenerate). The A1g mode is out-of-plane vibration (Figure 1c) whose frequency
is 305 cm–1. The Eg (doubly degenerate)
mode is in-plane vibration (Figure 1c) whose frequency is 235 cm–1. Table 1 lists the Raman-active
modes and the Raman shifts of β-As monolayer, germanene, blue
phosphorene, and β-Sb monolayer. All of these four materials
belong to space group P3̅m1 and point group D3d.

We considered four commonly used laser lines
with wavelengths 532,
633, 785, and 830 nm, corresponding to photon energies of 2.33, 1.96,
1.57, and 1.49 eV, respectively. Two of them are larger than the band
gap of the β-As monolayer 1.59 eV,26 two of them are smaller than the band gap. This band gap is underestimated
by DFT and can be improved by hybrid exchange–correlation functional26 or exchange–correlation energy whose
derivative of the density (or density matrix) with respect to the
number of electrons is discontinued at integers.27,28

After finding the Raman tensor, we calculated the Raman intensity;
we considered that the β-As monolayer is in xy plane. Therefore, the incident light is parallel to the β-As
monolayer plane when the incident light wave vector is along x-axis. The polarization direction of the incident light
can be written as ei = (0, cos θ,
sin θ); it is a common practice to measure the parallel and
perpendicular polarized scattered light whose polarization direction
is es|| = (0, cos θ, sin θ) and es⊥ = (0, −sin
θ, cos θ), respectively. These are called parallel polarization
configuration and perpendicular polarization configuration, respectively.

The form of Raman tensors we obtained agrees with the group theory.
β-As belongs to the D3d point group. The Raman tensor
of their Raman-active modes A1g and Eg (doubly
degenerate) modes has the form29 1  where a, b, c, and d are main terms,
other elements are 0 because of the point group symmetry. By substituting
the calculated Raman tensor for each modes and polarization vectors
of the incident and scattered light into eq 11 in the Methods section,
we have calculated the polarization angle-dependent Raman intensity
for each mode. The Raman intensities for these two polarization settings
are 2   3   4   5  

The angular-dependent
Raman intensities of different vibrating
modes of the β-As monolayer for four laser lines 532, 633, 785,
and 830 nm are shown in Figure 2 (parallel polarization configuration) and Figure 3 (perpendicular polarization
configuration). The order of magnitude of Raman intensities is different
because the Raman intensity is proportional to ωs4 (eq 11 in the Methods section). Therefore, we plot
|e⃗s·R⃗·e⃗i|2 for clarity. Raman intensities of the A1g and
Eg modes in parallel polarization configurations have two
maxima for all of the laser lines (Figure 2). The first term is dominant in eq 2 because |a| ≫ |b|. Therefore, the maxima locate at
θ = 0° and 180° for the A1g mode; the minima
intensities are zero at θ = 90° and 270° for the A1g mode. The first term and the third term in eq 3 are dominant because |c| ≈ 2|d|. Therefore, the common factor cos2 θ of these two terms leads to the similarity of the
polar plots of the Eg mode and that of the A1g mode. The remaining factors in eq 3 rotate the polar plots of the Eg mode with
respect to that of the A1g mode.

Figure 2 Polar plots of the angular-dependent
Raman intensities, |e⃗s·R⃗·e⃗i|2, of
A1g mode (a) and Eg mode (c) of the β-As
monolayer for four laser lines 532 nm (green), 633 nm (orange), 785
nm (red), and 830 nm (wine). The plots corresponding to the latter
three and two laser lines are enlarged in (b) for the A1g mode and (d) for the Eg mode, respectively. The polarization
direction of the scattered light is parallel to the polarization direction
of the incident light. The incident and scattered light are in x-direction.

Figure 3 Polar plots of the angular-dependent Raman intensities, |e⃗s·R⃗·e⃗i|2, of
the A1g mode (a) and Eg mode (c) of the β-As
monolayer for 532 nm (green), 633 nm (orange), 785 nm (red), and 830
nm (wine). The plots corresponding to the latter three and two laser
lines are enlarged in (b) for the A1g mode and (d) for
Eg mode, respectively. The polarization direction of the
scattered light is perpendicular to the polarization direction of
the incident light. The incident and scattered light are in x-direction.

We did not find a configuration that has four maxima as blue
phosphorene
had in the parallel polarization configuration.24

In the perpendicular polarization configuration,
both the A1g and Eg modes have four maxima for
all of the
laser lines. The common factor sin2(2θ) in eq 4 determines that the four
maxima of all of the laser lines locate at θ = 45° + n 90° for the A1g mode; the minima intensities
are zero at θ = n 90° for the A1g mode, where n is an integer. This is not relevant to the relative
value of a and b. The summary of
the first two terms in eq 5 is approximately a constant |d|2 because
|c| ≈ 2|d| for laser lines
830, 785, and 532 nm. Therefore, the location of maxima and minima
of polar plots of the Eg mode is determined by the third
term. The minima (maxima) locate near 67.5° + n 90° (22.5° + n 90°) because the
difference of argument of c and d is less than π/2 for laser lines 830 and 785 nm. The minima
(maxima) locate near 22.5° + n 90° (67.5°
+ n 90°) because the difference of argument
of c and d is larger than π/2
for the laser line 532 nm. The difference of argument of c and d is close to π/2 for the laser line
532 nm. Therefore, the third term in eq 5 is small; thus, the minimal amplitude of the polar
plots of the Eg mode is close to the maximal amplitude,
which is distinctly different from other polar plots. For the laser
line 633 nm, the first term in eq 5 is dominant because |c| ≫
|d|. Therefore, the minima (maxima) locate near n 90° (45° + n 90°).

When the incident light is perpendicular to the plane of β-As,
the polarization direction can be written as ei = (cos
θ, sin θ, 0). Then, the polarization direction of the
parallel and perpendicular polarized scattered light is es|| = (cos
θ, sin θ, 0) and e⊥S = (−sin
θ, cos θ, 0), respectively. The Raman intensities of the
parallel and perpendicular polarized scattered light are 6   7   8   9  

As one can see in the equations, only two elements of the Raman
tensor (a and c) play the role in
the Raman intensity, whereas the Raman intensity depends on all elements
of the Raman tensor when the incident light is parallel with the plane.
In addition, the Raman intensity of the A1g mode for parallel
polarized scattered light depends only on a; it is zero for perpendicular
polarized scattered light. The Raman intensity of Eg mode
depends only on c. None of the Raman intensities depend on the polarization
angle θ.

The phonon frequencies are 7.05 and 9.14 THz
for the in-plane (Eg) and out-of-plane (A1g)
vibration modes at Γ
point, respectively. Therefore, there are two peaks (235 and 305 cm–1) in the nonresonant Raman spectra (Figure 4). As listed in Table 1, it is similar to germanene,30 blue phosphorene,24 and β-Sb monolayer.25 The Raman
intensity corresponding to the Eg mode is stronger than
that corresponding to the A1g mode for the β-As monolayer
except for laser line 633 nm. The Raman intensity for different laser
lines follows hierarchy I532 > I633 > I785 > I830 except I633 of
the Eg mode.

Figure 4 Nonresonant Raman spectra of the β-As
monolayer for four
laser lines: 532 nm (green), 633 nm (orange), 785 nm (red), and 830
nm (wine). There are two peaks at 305 cm–1 (A1g mode) and 235 cm–1 (Eg mode).

We also calculate the absorbance
of the β-As monolayer (Figure 5). The absorbance
is isotropic for lights with polarization direction in the x–y plane. The absorbance increases
with the photon energy for the four laser lines we concerned.

vertical green dashed lines indicate the photon energy of four laser
lines 830 nm (1.49 eV), 785 nm (1.57 eV), 633 nm (1.96 eV), and 532
nm (2.33 eV).

Conclusions
In
summary, we systematically investigated vibrational properties
and Raman spectra of the buckled gray arsenic (β-As monolayer)
for four commonly used laser lines 532, 633, 785, and 830 nm. There
are not any imaginary vibrating modes, which mean the β-As monolayer
has the dynamic stability. All of the optical modes are Raman active.
The calculated Raman spectra show that there are two peaks at 235
and 305 cm–1 where the former one corresponds to
degenerate in-plane vibration modes Eg and the latter corresponds
to the out-of-plane vibration mode A1g. We calculated polarization
angle-dependent Raman intensities when the wave vector of incident
light is parallel and perpendicular to the plane of the β-As
monolayer. There are two (four) minima and two (four) maxima when
the polarization direction of scattered light is parallel (perpendicular)
to that of incident light and the wave vector of the incident light
is parallel to the β-As monolayer. The Raman intensities of
neither parallel polarization configuration nor perpendicular polarization
configuration depend on the polarization direction when the wave vector
of incident light is perpendicular to the β-As monolayer. The
shapes of the polar plots are resulted from the argument difference
between Raman tensor elements (c and d) and relative amplitudes of Raman tensor elements (|a| ≫ |b| and |c| ≈
2|d|). The Raman intensities decrease with increasing
wavelength of incident laser line except that of the Eg mode for laser line 633 nm.

Methods
Geometry optimization and
dielectric tensor calculation are done
with Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package.31 Phonon frequency and phonon modes are obtained with Phonopy code.32 The exchange–correlation potential is
treated at the level of the generalized gradient approximation using
Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof.33 For constructing basis set, the projected augmented wave method34,35 is employed. Energy cutoff for all calculations is 500 eV. The Brillouin
zone of the unit cell structure is sampled with a 15 × 15 ×
1 and 40 × 40 × 1 k-point grid for geometry
optimization and static calculation, respectively. Vacuum slabs of
1.5 nm thick are inserted between neighboring 2D atom sheets. The
convergence tolerance for the total energy and force calculations
set to 10–7eV and 0.01 eV/Å, respectively.

The Raman tensor is obtained with a finite displacement method36−38 10  where V is the volume of
unit cell, Mμ is the atomic mass
of atom μ, and δχαβ/δrl(μ) is the first derivative of the electric
polarizability tensor with respect to the atomic displacement. It
equals with the derivative of dielectric tensor εαβ divided by 4π because χαβ(ω)
= (εαβ(ω) – δαβ)/4π. ω is the frequency of laser
electric field. ejl(μ) is the eigen vector
of the j-th phonon mode at Γ point. The dielectric
tensor of the structure with finite displacement can be obtained with
DFT.

Then, the Raman intensity can be obtained36−38 11  where ωs is the frequency
of scattered light,  and  are
electric polarization vectors of incident
and scattered light, respectively.
