A novel lamellar Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-layered double hydroxide
(LDH) nanocomposite was successfully synthesized via the hydrothermal
method and tested as a highly efficient adsorbent for the removal
of Congo red (CR) dye from aqueous solution. Structural, morphological,
and spectroscopic characterization of the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH
nanocomposite were studied by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron
microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy, photoluminescence (PL) analysis, and UV–visible
spectroscopy analysis techniques. The CR dye adsorption performance
of the prepared materials increased with an increase in functionality.
The adsorption capacity of the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite
(172 mg/g, pH 7, temp 30 °C) was found to be higher than that
of pure Al(OH)3 (32 mg/g, pH 7, temp 30 °C) and CuMnAl-LDH
(102 mg/g, pH 7, temp 30 °C). The results revealed that anion
exchange and hydrogen bonding are mainly responsible for the adsorption
of CR onto the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite. Moreover,
the adsorption of CR in the presence of Cu(II) and NaCl salt showed
a synergistic and antagonistic effect while the presence of anionic
Cr(VI) ions had no significant effect. The adsorption thermodynamics,
isotherm, and kinetics modeling analyses were also conducted to study
the interactions between CR molecules and the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH
nanocomposite. The adsorption of CR was found to be endothermic and
followed by the pseudo-second-order kinetics and the Langmuir adsorption
isotherm model. The developed nanocomposite showed excellent potential
for treating industrial wastewater.

1 Introduction
Wastewater
effluents, which contain dyestuff and heavy metals from
a variety of industries, are often discharged into water bodies, and
it may cause harmful effects to aquatic life and the environment.
Among the significant polluters, especially with effluents containing
both dyes and heavy metals, textile industries are well known. Because
of the complex structures of dyes, they are not readily degradable,
and hence concerted human-made efforts are required to reduce the
toxicity of CR dye in aqua systems.1 There
are over 10 000 available commercial dyes, and the primary
consumers are the textile, pulp, and tannery industries.2 Congo red (CR) dye is highly soluble in water
and has a very high affinity for cellulose fiber, owing to which it
is preferably used in textile industries.3 For its toxic effect on human health and aquatic life,4 the use of CR dye is already banned in few countries.
However, many countries still overlook these health concerns and other
environmental hazards of CR.5 There is
now a rising consensus that due to their hazardous nature, these pollutants
needs to be eliminated with effective techniques before the effluents
discharged into the ecosystem.

Several techniques such as flocculation,
photocatalysis, coagulation,
biological degradation, membrane filtration, adsorption, and so forth
have been widely employed to eliminate toxic dyes from polluted wastewater.6−8 Amongst these, the application of the adsorption technique has become
dominant in the use of wastewater treatment because of its peculiar
properties such as high efficiency in removing pollutants when compared
to other conventional methods9 and its
low cost, ease of setup, and recyclability. Recently, the use of the
adsorption technique in treating wastewater has got a renewed boost
with the synthesis of newer novel materials in order to solve the
defects of the traditional sorbents.

Over other conventional
materials, nanomaterials have shown a very
high prospect in treating wastewater because of their exceptional
properties which include high surface area, possibilities of fabrication
into different morphological forms, possibilities of customized functionalization,
and higher efficiencies of adsorption with a fast adsorption rate.10 Several nanomaterials and their composites,
such as S-doped Fe2O3/C nanocomposite,11 zinc peroxide (ZnO2),3 and Maghemite nanoparticles,5 have been successfully utilized for the adsorption of CR dye from
water. Aluminum oxides/hydroxides are the most favorable adsorbent
material because of their excellent physical and textural characteristics.
Aluminum oxides/hydroxides also possess the ability to alter the mechanical
strength, porosity, hydrophilicity, and sorption capacity of nanocomposite
materials.12 Aluminum hydroxide-based materials
such as Al(OH)3,13,14 Fe3O4@Al(OH)3,15 and F–Al
hydroxides16 have shown excellent adsorption
property for different types of adsorbates including heavy metal organics,
mineral ions, and so forth in the treatment of wastewater.

Recently,
layered double hydroxide (LDH) has shown remarkable properties
to combat environmental challenges owing to its superior characteristics
in efficiently removing pollutants from wastewater. This property
is attributed to their unique two-dimensional (2D) nanostructure anionic
clays with a very large surface area and high anion exchange property.
The interlayer is easily reachable to anionic dyes, which is influenced
by the charged balancing anions and layer charge density.17 LDH has a general formula expressed as [M1–x2+Mx3+(OH)2]x+(An–)x/n·mH2O where M2+ represents the divalent metal cations such as Ni2+, Cu2+, and so forth, M3+ represents the trivalent
metal cations such as Mn3+ and Al3+, An– is the anion OH–, and
X is the molar ratio of the trivalent metal ion to total metal ions.
By considering the characteristics and the adsorption strength of
aluminum hydroxide and LDH, a new nanocomposite material having the
properties of both can be a good material for the environmental remediation
applications.

This study focuses on the synthesis of aluminum
hydroxide [Al(OH)3], copper manganese aluminum-LDH (CuMnAl-LDH),
and Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite as a superior material
for scavenging
of CR dye anions. Furthermore, the adsorption kinetics of CR dye onto
Al(OH)3, CuMnAl-LDH, and Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH
nanocomposite has been investigated. The equilibrium data were applied
to the isotherm models, and the co-adsorption of heavy metals and
sodium salt with CR onto the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite
was investigated.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization
The scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) images of the synthesized materials are shown in Figure 1. The SEM images
of Al(OH)3 (Figure 1a,b) show a sheetlike porous structure. A typical characteristic
SEM image of LDH is the formation of clustered platelike particles
or a layered structure, which looks cloudy and is connected at the
edges at different angles18 as evident
from the SEM images of CuMnAl-LDH shown in Figure 1c,d. The Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite
images shown in Figures 1e,f and 2a possess the characteristic nanosize
pores with a large surface area nucleated in the agglomerated vertical
sheet, which are connected at the edges at different angles. The transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) image shown in Figure 2b buttresses our SEM image shown in Figure 2a; it reveals that
CuMnAl-LDH is deposited over Al(OH)3 sheets. Moreover,
to confirm the elemental composition and distribution of the elements
in the composite, energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS) and elemental
(Figure S1) analysis of the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite were performed. EDS analysis showed
the presence of O, Al, Mn, and Cu with 68.12, 27.36, 3.19, and 1.32
atomic weight percentages, respectively. Elemental mapping analysis
clearly showed well-distributed O, Al, Mn, and Cu in the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of Al(OH)3, CuMnAl-LDH,
and Al(OH)/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite are shown in Figure 3. Al(OH)3 shows
six major peaks located at 17.8°, 29.8°, 39.0°, 47.6°,
55.6°, and 52.2° 2θ which can be indexed to 001, 111,
132, 141, 024, and 153 planes of nordstrandite [Al(OH)3]. The observed diffraction peak reflects the XRD characteristics
for aluminum hydroxide.19 The diffractogram
of CuMnAl-LDH shows sharp peaks, which are indicative of the characteristic
pattern of LDH. The intense peaks at 24.2°, 31.4°, 37.4°,
41.4°, 45.2°, 49.8°, 51.8°, and 63.9° correspond
to the 006, 015, 107, 111, 220, 116, 0111, and 0015 planes, suggesting
the formation of the CuMnAl-LDH pattern.17,18 Also, the XRD pattern of the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite
(Figure 3) follows
a similar pattern as Al(OH)3 and CuMnAl-LDH with the peak
diffraction of the crystalline structure and mesostructured Al(OH)3 with corresponding peaks at 24.3°, 28.1°, 31.4°,
37.6°, 49.1°, 51.8°, and 64.5° 2θ.

Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite.

Photoluminescence (PL) and UV–visible (UV–vis) absorbance
analysis were carried out to determine the optical properties of the
adsorbents. The PL emission spectra of Al(OH)3, CuMnAl-LDH,
and Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite are shown in Figure 4a. Three emission
peaks are seen on the emission spectra of Al(OH)3, the
strongest peak is seen at 476 nm, and the weak peaks are seen at 390
and 361 nm. CuMnAl-LDH shows two peaks at 371 and 471 nm, while slight
peak shifts were observed in the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite
with a sharp emission peak at 367 nm and a weak peak at 472 nm. The
PL intensity of the materials is in the order Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH
nanocomposite < CuMnAl-LDH < Al(OH)3. In general,
the weaker the PL intensity, the better are the optical properties.8 The Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite
showed the weakest PL intensity in comparison with the other materials;
it is expected to possess the best optical properties. These results
are further confirmed by the UV–vis absorbance analysis as
shown in Figure 4b.
The visible light absorption properties of the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH
nanocomposite is much higher than those of Al(OH)3 and
CuMnAl LDH. This may be attributed to the combined effect of the optically
active surface generated from the mixing of Al(OH)3 and
CuMnAl-LDH.

2.2 Adsorption
Studies
2.2.1 Effect of pH
CR is an anionic dye,
and initial solution pH influences its molecular structure.20 Therefore, the effect of the solution pH on
the removal of CR by Al(OH)3, CuMnAl-LDH, and Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite was investigated at varying pH from
4 to 10 at 30 °C, and the results are shown in Figure 5. It was observed that the
adsorption of CR decreases as the solution pH increases from 4 to
10, and maximum adsorption was attained at pH 4 for all the studied
adsorbents. Moreover, the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite
showed the highest adsorption capacity for CR dye in comparison with
CuMnAl-LDH and Al(OH)3 at all the studied pH values. A
similar trend for adsorption of the CR dye at different pH has been
reported.21,22 This behavior can be explained based on
the functional groups and surface charge on the adsorbents and the
CR. At the acidic pH, there are more H+ ions in the solution
and the adsorbent material becomes positively charged by absorbing
the H+ ions, which interact electrostatically with the
SO3– functional group of the anionic
CR dye molecules. As the solution pH shifts from acidic to basic,
more OH– in the solution gets adsorbed on the surface
of the materials and thereby generates a negative charge on the adsorbent
surface; which does not favor the adsorption of the anionic CR dye
molecule because of electrostatic repulsion. Thus, the lowest adsorption
capacity was recorded at pH 10.23

Figure 5 Effect of pH
on the removal of CR dye onto Al(OH)3,
CuMnAl-LDH, and Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite.

2.2.2 Effect of Contact Time
and Adsorption Kinetics
The effect of contact time on the
adsorption of CR dye onto Al(OH)3, CuMnAl-LDH, and Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite
was investigated at an initial CR dye solution of 250 mg/L concentration
and the contact time ranging from 15 to 300 min, and the results are
depicted in Figure 6. The sorption of CR dye onto Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite,
CuMnAl-LDH, and Al(OH)3 was found to increase with an increase
in the contact time until equilibrium was attained. The adsorption
capacity increased from 52 to 172 mg/g, 13 to 102 mg/g, and 5 to 32
mg/g for the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite, CuMnAl-LDH,
and Al(OH)3, respectively, as the reaction times varied
from 15 to 300 min. The curves for CuMnAl-LDH and the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite showed that sorption occurred in three
steps. The adsorption equilibrium for Al(OH)3 was reached
within 90 min. Although adsorption of CR dye on CuMnAl-LDH and the
Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite showed saturation in 210
min. The process was rapid and produced more than half of the sorption
within the initial 60 min in the first step. As the contact time increased
to 120 min, the sorption rate became slow for the second step until
equilibrium was attained at the final step after 210 min. These results
suggest that there was availability of more active sites (vacant)
on the materials for sorption, which resulted in a fast adsorption
process in the first step. After that, in the second step, adsorption
became slower as the active sites got saturated, and thus the adsorption
reached to equilibrium.3

Figure 6 Effect of contact time
on the removal of CR dye onto Al(OH)3, CuMnAl-LDH, and
Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite.

A kinetic study was performed to determine the rate of dye removal
on the synthesized adsorbent materials. The data obtained were fitted
to pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order kinetic models. The
pseudo-first-order model24 was based on
the assumptions that the rate of change of solute uptake with time
is directly proportional to the difference in saturation concentration
and the amount of solid uptake with time. The linear equation is denoted
as 1  where qe and qt (mg/g) are the CR adsorption
capacity at equilibrium and at time t, respectively,
and k1 (1/min) is the pseudo-first-order
rate constant. A linear plot log(qe – qt) against t is shown in Figure S2a.

The linear
equation for the pseudo-second-order model proposed
by Ho and Mckay25 is denoted as 2  where k2 (g/min)
is the pseudo-second-order rate constant. The values of the kinetic
parameters were calculated from a linear plot of t/qt versus t, as shown in Figure S2b. The values obtained
from kinetic models are shown in Table 1. The regression coefficient R2 and qe(cal) are important values that can be used
to illustrate a good agreement with these models. The R2 values for Al(OH)3 (R2 – 0.9145) and the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite
(R2 – 0.9929) obtained from the
pseudo-second-order are higher than R2 values obtained from the pseudo-first-order model. Moreover, the qe(cal) values calculated from the pseudo-second-order kinetic equation
are much closer to the experimental qe(exp), which indicates
that the adsorption of CR dye on Al(OH)3 and the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite is best described using the pseudo-second-order
model. Similar results for the adsorption kinetics of CR dye have
also been reported elsewhere.21,23 These results suggested
that the adsorption process is supposed to be chemisorption.3 On the other hand, the adsorption of CR dye on
the CuMnAl-LDH material best fitted into the pseudo-first-order model
because of the higher R2 (0.9635) than
the R2 (0.9425) value obtained from the
pseudo-second-order model. Moreover, calculated adsorption qe(cal) (94.27 mg/g) is much closer to the experimental qe(exp) (102
mg/g) for the pseudo-first-order kinetic model, indicating adsorption
of CR dye onto CuMnAl-LDH to be physisorption.20,39

2.2.3 Adsorption Isotherm and
Thermodynamics
The effect of initial CR concentrations ranging
from 100 to 500
mg/L and temperatures between 30 and 50 °C on the adsorption
process are presented in Figure 7. The results revealed that the adsorption is highly
dependent on the initial CR concentration and temperature. The adsorption
of CR onto the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite increases
with the increase in initial CR concentrations at all the studied
temperatures, which may be because of the increase in the driving
force for mass transfer of the CR dye molecules onto the surface of
the adsorbent at a high CR dye concentration.3,11 Moreover,
higher adsorption (208 mg/g) at 50 °C revealed that the reaction
is endothermic in nature.26 It is proposed
that with an increase in the solution temperature, there is an increase
in the kinetic mobility of the adsorbent and adsorbate molecules as
they gain energy leading to the improvement of CR dye accessibility
to the active site on the surface of the adsorbent molecules.27

Figure 7 Effect of temperature on the removal of CR dye onto the
Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite.

To investigate the distribution of CR molecules onto the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite, Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm
models are applied to the equilibrium data. The Langmuir isotherm
is based on the assumptions that there is an equal affinity for the
adsorbate molecules by all the sites on the adsorbent and there is
little or no interaction among the adsorbate molecules, which form
a monolayer at the adsorbent surface.28 The linearized equation of the Langmuir model is represented as 3  where Ce (mg/L)
and qe (mg/g) are the CR concentration
at equilibrium and the adsorption capacity at equilibrium, respectively. qm (mg/g) is the measure of the theoretical maximum
adsorption capacity for CR dye onto Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH
and KL (L/g) represents the Langmuir constant
which measures the energy of adsorption.

Unlike the Langmuir
isotherm, the Freundlich isotherm assumes that
the affinity for adsorbate molecules by all the sites on the adsorbent
is not equal and there is interaction among the adsorbate molecules
forming a multilayer on the adsorbent surface. The linearized equation
of the Freundlich model is represented as 4  where Ce and qe are the concentration at equilibrium and adsorption
equilibrium, respectively. KF and 1/n represent the Freundlich constants. KF [mg/g (L/mg)1/n] is the
measure of the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent, that is, the
greater the KF, the greater the adsorption,
and (1/n) is the indicator of adsorption effectiveness.
The favorable adsorption of the Langmuir isotherm can be expressed
in terms of an equilibrium parameter or separation factor RL (mg/L).29,30RL is a basic characteristic of the Langmuir model.1 It gives information about the nature of the
CR dye adsorption and is represented as 5  where b is the Langmuir constant
and Ci is the initial concentration of
the dye. For a favorable process, RL must
be greater than 0 and less than 1 (0 < RL < 1), and the RL values for adsorption
of CR dye onto the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite were
well within the favorable adsorption range (Table 2). Figure S3 a,b depicts the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm curves for adsorption
of CR onto the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite at 30,
40, and 50 °C, respectively. Langmuir and Freundlich constants
were calculated from the slopes and the intercept of the plot Ce/qe versus Ce and qe versus Ce, respectively. Table 2 shows the values of Langmuir and Freundlich
constants. On comparing the values of R2, it has been observed that the Langmuir adsorption model is best
fitted to the adsorption data than the Freundlich model. This may
be due to homogenous sorption of CR dye on all the sites of the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite.20 Furthermore,
the RL values obtained for the adsorption
of CR dye onto the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite have
the values between 0.007 and 0.036 which are in the range of 0–1,
revealing a favorable adsorption process.

The effect of temperature was studied at different
dye concentrations,
and the related thermodynamic parameters: standard free energy change
(ΔG°), standard enthalpy change (ΔH°), and standard entropy change (ΔS°) were calculated from the following equations 6   7  where Kc represents
the equilibrium constant, T (K) is the temperature
in kelvin, Ce (mg/L) and qe (mg/g) are the equilibrium concentration and adsorption
capacity, respectively, and R represents the universal
gas constant. The (ΔH°) and (ΔS°) values were obtained from the slope and intercept
of the thermodynamic plots of ln(qe/Ce) versus 1/T, and the calculated
values of the thermodynamic parameters are shown in Table 3. At all the temperatures, the
values of ΔG° are negative, which indicate
a spontaneous nature of the adsorption process; the more negative
value of ΔG° with an increase in temperature
shows that the process becomes more favorable with an increase in
temperature. The positive values of (ΔH°)
and (ΔS°) indicate that the reaction is
endothermic and there is an increase in randomness in the adsorbent/adsorbate
interface during the adsorption process which is consistent with the
effect of temperature.

2.2.4 Co-Adsorption
of CR
The adsorptive
removal of CR onto the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite
in the presence of Cu(II) ions, Cr(VI) ions, and NaCl salt has been
performed to investigate the effect of co-ions on the adsorption process.
As shown in Figure 8a, the co-existence of Cu(II) ions with CR increases the adsorption
capacity of the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite for CR
dye. These results suggest that a more positive charge was created
by the Cu(II) ion complexes formed on the surface of the composite
to create an electrostatic force leading to the more active site for
adsorption of the anionic CR dye. However, no significant effect on
the adsorption capacity of CR dye onto the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH
nanocomposite in coexistence with Cr(VI) ions was observed. This may
be due to the little or no interaction between the Cr(VI) ions and
the surface of the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite. The
presence of NaCl salt hindered the adsorption capacity of CR dye on
the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite in an antagonistic
effect, causing a reduction of the adsorption capacity at all the
studied concentrations. This lead to a hypothesis that there is an
exchange of ions between Na+ and the proton of surface
OH– groups on the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH
nanocomposite,31 thereby decreasing the
active sites for adsorption of CR dye.

Figure 8 (a) Adsorption of CR
on the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite
in a binary mixture of Cu(II), Cr(VI), and NaCl (b) adsorption of
Cu(II) and Cr(VI) onto the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite.

Moreover, to find the interaction between the metal
ions and Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite, the adsorption
of Cu(II) and Cr(VI)
was performed in the absence of CR. The result depicted in Figure 8b shows complete
removal of Cu(II) at a concentration of 10 mg/L, until equilibrium
was reached at 50 mg/L concentration. The maximum adsorption capacity
recorded was 18.85 mg/L. However, there was no adsorption of Cr (VI)
over the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite. The sorption
of the Cu(II) ions on the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite
may be explained using the formation of complexes between the exchangeable
anions, that is, NO3–, SO42–, and Cl– in the interlayer
of the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite and the Cu(II)
ions. Also, the hydroxide precipitation of Cu(II) ions via chemical
bonding with the hydroxyl groups present on the surface of the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite is another possibility.32,33 On the other hand, Cr(VI) ions are anionic species and their removal
on the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite mainly depends
on the interaction with the protonated sites of the surface of the
composite.34 Therefore, Cr(VI) ions are
noninteractive with the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite,
which led to no sorption of Cr(VI) ions. The result seen in this study
agrees to our observation in the binary adsorption studies that the
precipitated copper complexions on the surface of the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite protonated the surface of the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite adsorbent which increases the electrostatic
strength for CR dye by providing more active sites for adsorption.
Also, Cr(VI) noninteraction with the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH
nanocomposite in a single batch experiment agrees that there is no
effect of the sorbates on the adsorption of CR dye onto the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite in a mixture.

2.2.5 Adsorption Mechanism
The adsorption
mechanism is controlled by the nature of the adsorbent and the pollutant.32 Aluminum trihydrate is characterized as a metal
hydroxide-based adsorbent material having an octahedral structure
made up of double layers of hydroxyl ions containing two-thirds of
aluminum ions within the layers. The hydroxyl ions are arranged in
a sequential layer directly opposite to each other in a cubic packing,
and the availability of hydroxyl functional groups is of high possibility.
These hydroxyl groups may interact electrostatically with the CR dye
molecules.5,35 The anionic nature of the dye suggests sorption
of the CR dye by an electrostatic attraction with the positive surface
of CuMnAl-LDH. The presence of hydroxyl ions on CuMnAl-LDH may also
initiate hydrogen bonding between the OH– group
of LDH and the O atoms of the CR dye molecules.36 The most dominant adsorption mechanism in LDH can be attributed
to anionic exchange. The interlayer anions (NO3–, SO42–, and Cl–)
present in CuMnAl-LDH are easily replaced by the anionic CR molecules.37 The Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite
is characterized as CuMnAl-LDH having a deposit on Al(OH)3; these Al(OH)3 sheets increase the oxygen functional
group in the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite which provides
more vacant active sites, thereby enhancing the adsorption of CR molecules
via hydrogen or chemical bonding and electrostatic interaction is
formed between the surface of the positively charged Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite and the anionic CR dye under the acidic
conditions as discussed in Effect of pH . The number of functional
groups and better distribution of CuMnAl-LDH in the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite are mainly responsible for the higher adsorption
of CR onto the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite in comparison
with Al(OH)3 and CuMnAl-LDH. Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) spectroscopy analysis further revealed the adsorption mechanism
of the sample before and after adsorption of CR (Figure 9). A series of bands in the
low-frequency region 1000–400 cm–1 can be
ascribed to the vibration of lattice metal–oxygen (Cu–O,
Mn–O, and Al–O), and the band at 661 cm–1 confirms the presence of Al–OH. The peaks at 1384 and 934
cm–1 are mainly attributed to the NO3– and SO42– interlayer
ions in LDH, respectively. The noticeable changes in the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH CR spectrum at the bands corresponding to the
metal lattice indicate adsorption of CR dye by electrostatic attraction
between the metal ions and the CR dye molecules. The disappearance
of peaks at 1384 and 934 cm–1 is due to the loss
of NO3– and SO42– interlayer ions because of anionic exchange. The shift of hydroxyl
groups and interlayer water molecule peak in the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH CR spectrum demonstrates surface adsorption and hydrogen
bonding between the adsorbent and the CR dye molecules. After the
reaction, the new peaks at 1578 and 1611 cm–1 represent
the −N=N– stretching which is a typical of CR.
Other peaks seen at 3475, 1045, and 1174 cm–1 represent
the N–H group from the parent dye structure and the SO3– stretching of the sulfonate group of CR
dye.42,43 From these findings, it is presumed that
CR dye was incorporated into the sorbent with the active functional
group.

before and after CR adsorption.

Moreover, XPS analysis has been performed to confirm the adsorption
of CR onto the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite. XPS spectra
of the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite before and after
CR adsorption are shown in Figure 10. The survey scan (Figure 10a) of the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH
nanocomposite shows the presence of Al 2p, C 1s (background carbon),
O 1s, Cu 2p, and Mn 2p at their respective binding energies. The survey
scan of the CR-adsorbed Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite
(Figure 10a) shows
the presence of two extra peaks for N 1s and S 2p, which mainly belong
to CR. The high-resolution XPS spectra of all the elements in the
Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite are shown in Figure 10b–e. The
high-resolution spectra of Al 2p shown in Figure 10b show the major peak centered at 74.24
eV mainly because of Al(OH) and a small peak at a binding energy (BE)
of 72.99 eV belonging to the metallic Al. The peaks appearing at a
BE of 933 eV (Figure 10c) belong to Cu 2p3/2, which indicates the presence of
bivalent Cu in the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite. The
deconvoluted spectra for Mn 2p show two peaks belonging to Mn 2p3/2 and Mn 2p1/2 at 640.96 and 652.56 eV, respectively,
with a separation of 11.60 eV, an indication of the presence of Mn2+.44 The peaks for O 1s at a BE
of 530.09 eV belong to the M–O (M = Al, Cu, and Mn) bond and
531.61 eV are assigned to the hydroxyl group of the adsorbed oxygen
water.

CR adsorption, and (f–l) after CR adsorption.

The high-resolution spectra of the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH
nanocomposite after CR adsorption are shown in Figure 10f–l. The deconvoluted peaks for Al
2p, C 1s, O 1s, Cu 2p, and Mn 2p appeared at the same position with
the slight change in the BE because of interaction of the functional
groups with CR dye molecules. The presence of the two new peaks for
N 1s and S 2p confirms the adsorption of CR.45 The high-resolution spectra of N 1 s (Figure 10l) show the peaks at 398.87, 400, 401, and
403 eV corresponding to the C–N, N–H, N=N, and
NH2 groups present in the CR molecules, respectively. The
deconvoluted spectra of S 2p (Figure 10k) show the peaks at 162.82, 165.06, and 167.44 eV
belonging to the C–S and SO3– groups
of CR dye molecules. The appearance of the new peaks for N and S confirms
the successful adsorption of the CR dye onto the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite.

2.2.6 Desorption
Studies
In order to
evaluate the reusability of the material, the regeneration properties
of the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite were studied in
a sorption–desorption cycle. A preliminary desorption study
was conducted using solutions of sodium hydroxide (NaOH), hydrogen
chloride (HCl), carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), acetone (C3H6O), ethanol (C2H5OH), propanol
(C3H8O), acetonitrile (C2H3N), and dimethyl formaldehyde (DMF) (C3H7NO),
and the solution with the best performance (DMF) was chosen for the
study. The saturated Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite from
adsorption was desorbed in DMF solution and shaken for 3 h. The solid
Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite particles were washed
with deionized water, alcohol, and acetone. After that, it was centrifuged
to recover the solid material which was dried at 105 °C for 2
h. The recovered adsorbent was used for the next adsorption cycle.
Three cycles were completed (Figure S4),
and throughout these cycles, the concentration of CR to the adsorbent
was kept constant. The result shows that the adsorption capacity of
65.88 mg/g was sustained after three cycles. The low desorption may
be as a result of the chemisorption between the CR molecules and Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite molecules during the adsorption
process. After the first use of the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH
nanocomposite, all the exchangeable anions were replaced by the CR
molecules. Therefore, the exchangeable anions NO3, SO4, Cl were absent in the layers of the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH
nanocomposite during the regeneration process, and adsorption of CR
relied on the hydroxyl groups. Hence, physical adsorption, hydrogen
bonding, and electrostatic forces were supposed to be responsible
for the adsorption of CR during the reusability study.38

2.2.7 Comparison of the Adsorption
Capacity of
the Various Adsorbents
The adsorption capacity of various
adsorbents used for the removal of CR from aqueous solution has been
compared with the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite and
is shown in Table 4. The comparison reveals that the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite
shows better adsorption for the CR molecules, which suggests that
the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite is a suitable adsorbent
and can be applied for wastewater purification applications.

3 Conclusions
In this study, Al(OH)3, CuMnAl-LDH, and Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite were
synthesized and characterized by various
techniques. Based on the result, the sorbents showed a high adsorption
capacity for CR dye in the order Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH >
CuMnAl-LDH
> Al(OH)3. The presence of more functional groups and
layer
anions contributed to the superior adsorption capability of the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite. The adsorption reaction was endothermic,
and the maximum adsorption capacity of CR dye was attained at pH 4.
In the binary systems of combined pollutants with CR dye, Cu(II) ions
had a synergistic effect, Cr(VI) ions had an antagonistic effect,
and NaCl salt had no effect on CR dye adsorption by the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite. Besides, the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite was more effective in removing Cu(II) ions
from aqueous solution than Cr(VI) ions. The kinetic and isotherm adsorption
studies of CR dye onto the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite
revealed that the experimental model fitted well with the pseudo-second-order
and Langmuir model which indicates chemisorption and homogeneity of
sorption on all the sites of the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite.
These results revealed that the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite
is an efficient adsorbent which can be used for the removal of the
contaminants from the wastewater.

4 Materials
and Methods
4.1 Materials
CR dye (C32H22N6Na2O6S2) and
urea were procured from Techno Pharmchem, Haryana, India. CuSO4·5H2O was procured from Chadwell Heath, Essex,
England, and BDH Chemicals Ltd. Sigma-Aldrich Co., USA, supplied sodium
hydroxide, and Al2(NO3)3·9H2O was obtained from Panreac Quimica SAU, Spain. Scharlab S.L.,
Spain, supplied sodium dodecyl sulfonate (SDS). MnCl2·4H2O, K2Cr2O7,, and
ammonia solution were supplied by BDH Chemicals Ltd., Poole, England.

4.2 Aluminum Hydroxide Preparation
Al(OH)3 was synthesized via a hydrothermal method. The solutions
were prepared by mixing 2.8 g SDS and 22.9 g Al2(NO3)3·9H2O in 70 and 40 mL of deionized
water, respectively, at 50 °C. After that, the SDS solution was
added slowly to the Al2(NO3)3·9H2O solution under stirring at 50 °C. After that, 12 mL
of ammonia (25%) was added dropwise into the mixture and stirred for
2 h. The obtained white precipitate was transferred to a hydrothermal
reactor and heated for 90 h at 120 °C in the oven. The reactor
was allowed to cool down to room temperature after the completion
of the reaction, and the resulting solution was centrifuged to collect
the solid product which was thoroughly washed with deionized water,
ethanol, and acetone and subsequently dried at 105 °C to get
Al(OH)3.

4.3 Synthesis of CuMnAl-LDH
and the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH Nanocomposite
A typical
procedure for
the synthesis of the Al(OH)3/CuMnAl-LDH nanocomposite is
described as follows. Initially, 0.31 g CuSO4·5H2O, 0.33 g Al2(NO3)3·9H2O, and 0.25 g MnCl2·4H2O were dissolved
into 50 mL of deionized water. Thereafter, 0.5 g Al(OH)3 powder was added to the metal ion solution and stirred for 2 h.
After that, 1.9 g urea and 0.02 g NaOH were added to the solution
under stirring conditions. After 2 h of stirring, the solution was
transferred to the hydrothermal reactor and heated in the oven for
20 h at 130 °C. After cooling of the reactor, the precipitate
was filtered, thoroughly washed with deionized water, ethanol, and
acetone, and dried at 105 °C. CuMnAl-LDH was synthesized using
the same method in the absence of Al(OH)3.

4.4 Adsorption Experiment
The experimental
adsorption procedure for the removal of CR dye and heavy metals [Cu(II)
and Cr(VI) ions] onto the synthesized materials was performed using
the batch method. A constant mass of 0.02 g of each adsorbent was
added to 20 mL of the CR dye and/or heavy metal solution of known
concentration in a conical flask under constant agitation at 150 rpm
and fixed pH and temperature. Standard solutions of HCl and NaOH (0.1
M) were used to adjust the pH of the dye solution in the range 4–10.
The adsorption equilibrium was studied using the CR dye concentrations
between 100 and 500 mg/L and Cu(II) and Cr(VI) of concentrations from
10 to 50 mg/L. The samples were drawn after a fixed time interval
from conical flasks into the vials and centrifuged on the TG16- WS
centrifuge system at 4000 rpm to separate the adsorbent from the solution.
The Cu(II) and Cr(VI) concentrations remaining in solution after adsorption
was analyzed using the powder pillow bicinchoninate method (HACH—cuVer
1 copper reagent) and 1,5-diphenylcarbohydrazide method (HACH—chromaVer
3 chromium reagent), respectively, while the CR dye concentration
was analyzed by a UV–visible spectrophotometer (HACh DR 6000)
at 495 nm wavelength. The adsorption capacity of dye removal was calculated
using the following formula 8  where qe is the
adsorption capacity at equilibrium, Ci is the initial dye concentration (mg/L), Ce is the dye concentration at adsorption equilibrium (mg/L), V is the volume of dye solution (L), and m is the weight of the adsorbent (g).

4.5 Instrumentation
The XRD was carried
out using the XRD Ultima IV X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα
X-ray radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) at 40 kV and a current of
40 mA, in the scan range of 5–80°. The surface morphologies
of the adsorbents were determined using the scanning electron microscope(JEOL-JSM7600
F) and high-resolution transmission electron microscope (Tecnai G2
F20, FEI, USA), and UV–visible absorbance analysis was recorded
on the Lambda 900 (PerkinElmer UV WinLab 6.0.4.0738/1.61.00 Lambda
900), while the study of PL was carried out using the PerkinElmer
750, USA.
