In this work, we
report on a comparison among graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs)
employing different dielectrics as gate layers to evaluate their microwave
response. In particular, aluminum oxide (Al2O3), titanium oxide (TiO2), and hafnium oxide (HfO2) have been tested. GFETs have been fabricated on a single chip and
a statistical analysis has been performed on a set of 24 devices for
each type of oxide. Direct current and microwave measurements have
been carried out on such GFETs and short circuit current gain and
maximum available gain have been chosen as quality factors to evaluate
their microwave performance. Our results show that all of the devices
belonging to a specific group (i.e., with the same oxide) have a well-defined
performance curve and that the choice of hafnium oxide represents
the best trade-off in terms of dielectric properties. Graphene transistors
employing HfO2 as the dielectric layer, in fact, exhibit
the best performance in terms of both the cutoff frequency and the
maximum frequency of oscillation.

Introduction
The choice
of the gate dielectric, as is well known, is crucial to develop highly
competitive transistors,1 especially for
microwave applications. This aspect is particularly critical for graphene
field-effect transistors (GFETs)2,3 due to the intrinsic
material incompatibility between pristine graphene and dielectric
oxide layers.2 Graphene surfaces are, in
fact, chemically inert3 to atomic layer
deposition precursors and this peculiarity makes the integration of
high-dielectric constant materials still an open issue.2 Of course, intentional graphene lattice damage
that could improve oxide layers adhesion is strongly undesirable.4 In metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor
(MOSFET) technology, a thinner oxide, i.e., a higher oxide capacitance
(COX), is desired to maximize the high-frequency performance of the device, since it leads to a higher value of transconductance
and, consequently, cutoff frequency.5 Unfortunately,
a thin gate oxide has two main drawbacks: high leakage current due
to tunneling phenomena and poor long-time reliability.6 As shown by Benz et al.,7 hexagonal
boron nitride (h-BN) could operate as a superior gate dielectric.
However, synthesis of large-area h-BN is in its infancy and deposition
of high-quality material is not yet well established.8 Another alternative dielectric could be mica, but it suffers
from electrical hysteresis and hydrophilicity: this makes mica not
a good candidate for FET gating.9 As a
possible solution, oxides with a high dielectric constant κ
(i.e., high-κ oxide insulators) have been widely employed.10 In this case, a good compromise between the
κ-factor and the semiconductor/oxide band offset needs to be
found, since high-κ oxides exhibit low band-offset values.11 Traditionally, HfO2 has been the
most exploited oxide, thanks to its high dielectric constant (κ
≈ 25). TiO2 presents an even higher κ value
(κ ≈ 80), but it is thermally unstable when deposited
over silicon.12 On the other hand, Al2O3 exhibits a too low dielectric constant (κ
≈ 9) but a very high breakdown voltage.10,13 All
of the above-mentioned oxides can potentially be used in the GFETs
fabrication as gate oxide layers.

In this work, we report on
the fabrication and electrical characterization (in both DC and microwave
regimes) of back-gated GFETs employing Al2O3, TiO2, and HfO2 as insulating layers. Our
work is aimed at evaluating the dependence of the high-frequency performance
of such devices on the oxide material. Although in the literature different studies have been carried out on GFETs devices employing
separately Al2O3, TiO2, and HfO2 (for example, we refer the reader to refs (14−16)), none of them
have performed a comparison of microwave performance of devices fabricated
on the same chip. For this reason, our study can give a contribution
in the field especially for manufacturers, confirming that the choice
of hafnium oxide as the gate dielectric represents a promising solution
to obtain the best compromise in terms of both contact resistance
and field-effect mobility.

Fabrication
and Methods
The back-gated design allows our GFETs to be
used for optical mixing, illuminating them via free-space radiation,17 even if the underlying gate structure does not
provide a flat surface for graphene deposition. Furthermore, top-gated
graphene FETs typically require a seeding layer for high-quality dielectric
deposition, which can lead to the deterioration of graphene quality.4 Although not perfect for RF performance, back-gated
geometry is still suitable for statistical investigation of oxide
properties. Herein, we will refer to a “devices group”
as a set of about 24 nominally identical devices fabricated on the
same chip and employing the same gate oxide (i.e., Al2O3, TiO2, or HfO2). Three different groups
of devices have been fabricated on sapphire substrate18,19 and then their microwave performance has been studied in detail
and compared. Figure 1a shows the GFETs fabrication steps.

Figure 1 (a) Schematic representation
of GFETs fabrication steps, (b) comparison among Raman spectra of
transferred graphene on Al2O3, TiO2, and HfO2. (c) Strain-doping map of Raman G- and 2D-peak
positions (ωG, ω2D, respectively)
obtained from the samples with the three different oxides.

First, the dual-finger
back-gate has been patterned on a sapphire substrate by e-beam lithography
followed by the evaporation of a thin Ti/Au bilayer (∼5/40
nm) and lift-off in acetone. Then, atomic layer deposition (ALD) has
been used to deposit three different oxides. Particularly, a thickness
of ∼11, 13, and 11 nm has been obtained for Al2O3, TiO2, and HfO2, respectively. Both
Al2O3 and TiO2 have been deposited
at 100 °C, whereas 120 °C cycles have been employed for
HfO2 deposition. Then, a CVD-grown graphene film, previously
grown on copper foil and laminated on oxidized silicon substrate,
was transferred onto different oxides using wet transfer technique.
One mol NaOH solution was used to etch a thin film of silicon
dioxide, helping the delamination of graphene from the substrate and
a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) stamp was adopted to pick it up from
the substrate and transfer onto the devices. After oxide deposition,
graphene was patterned in a meandered structure by reactive ion etching
to minimize contact resistance.20 Subsequently,
source/drain electrodes have been patterned onto a graphene sheet
using E-beam lithography followed by a Ti/Au (∼5/100 nm) deposition
and lift-off in acetone. All of the fabricated devices exhibit the
same geometry. In particular, the gate–drain/source distance
is 0.25 μm, the gate length is 0.5 μm, and gate width
is 20 μm. Such values have been chosen after a parametrical
study based on GFETs geometry.21 We employed
Raman spectroscopy to assess the high quality of the transferred monolayer
graphene onto all of the three oxides, as shown by the distinctive
G (1580 cm–1) and 2D (2680 cm–1) peaks22 reported in Figure 1b. The quality of the transferred
graphene is benchmarked by evaluating the width of the 2D peak and
the strain-doping figure of merit. The 2D width are 37, 38, and 40
cm–1 for the TiO2, HfO2, and
Al2O3 substrates, respectively. Figure 1c shows the strain-doping figure
of merit of graphene obtained by plotting the positions of G and 2D
peaks for each oxide layer.23 Graphene
on Al2O3 is the least strained and has a carrier
concentration of about 5 × 1012 cm–2, whereas HfO2 and TiO2 show higher degree
of strain, but HfO2 is the least doped and TiO2 has the highest carrier concentration (above 5 × 1012 cm–2). From the Raman analysis, we expect that
GFETs with HfO2 as a dielectric layer show the highest
mobility performance due to the lowest doping of graphene (about 2
× 1012 cm–2), even if graphene suffers
from tensile strain. However, devices fabricated using Al2O3 show a slightly higher level of doping concentration
(about 5 × 1012 cm–2) and negligible
strain of graphene. The TiO2-based devices suffer from
concurrent effect of higher doping concentration (about 6 × 1012 cm–2) and compressive strain of graphene.

Results and Discussion
After fabrication,
all of the samples were electrically characterized in ambient conditions.
In particular, microwave and DC measurements were simultaneously performed
for each GFET operating point, employing an automated bench, controlled
via dedicated software to avoid the shift of the static curves due
to the well-known hysteresis in graphene-based devices.24−26

DC measurements, performed
in the ranges VGS = −1 to 1 V and VDS = −1 to 1 V, allowed us to obtain
the static transconductance curves (ID vs VGS) and, hence, to evaluate the
incremental low-frequency transconductance (gm = ∂ID/∂VGS |VDS=const), whose value deeply influences the performance of all of the devices. Figure 2 depicts the results
of the measurements carried out on three samples, each one showing
the best performance in terms of the ON/OFF ratio and maximum gm, within each device group (we will refer to
them as “best devices” in the following). All of the
curves are parameterized in VDS. Our transistors
exhibit a p-type behavior as inferred from the position of the Dirac
point.27 As a consequence of the different
gate oxides employed, each DC curves group shows a different broadening.
This aspect is of great interest, since it leads to different ON/OFF
ratios and static gm values, as reported
in Table 1.

Figure 2 ID and gm vs VGS curves as a function of VDS for
GFETs employing Al2O3, TiO2, and
HfO2 as gate oxide.

Maximum Static Transconductance

Al2O3	1.67	–3.86	
TiO2	1.93	–4.03	
HfO2	1.97	–10.66	
Our
measurements show that the use of HfO2 as the oxide layer
leads to an improvement in terms of static transconductance and a
moderate increase of the ON/OFF ratio.

S-parameters have been
measured using a N5232A Vector Network Analyzer and a Cascade Summit
9000 wafer-probe station in the frequency range [300 kHz to 20.003
GHz], biasing each GFET in its operating point where it exhibits the
highest gm value. All of the measurements
have been performed in standard environment conditions. Starting from
the S-parameters, short-circuit current gain (|h21|) and maximum available gain (MAG) (and, consequently, fT and fmax) have
been calculated for each device and chosen as figures of merit for
high-frequency analysis.28 To extrapolate
the intrinsic device gain values, we performed a de-embedding procedure
through experimental measurements on auxiliary test structures implemented
on the same chip.29 The de-embedded |h21| and |MAG| curves are depicted in Figure 3.

Figure 3 (a) |h21| and (b) |MAG| plots
for GFETs employing Al2O3, TiO2,
and HfO2 as gate oxide.

The data
refer to a statistical average of 24 identical GFETs for each device
group. As depicted in Figure 3a, the |h21| curves trends are
well defined and show a 20 dB/dec slope. As expected from the DC analysis,
the devices with HfO2 show the best performance in terms
of maximum gains, with fT = 16.46 GHz
and fmax = 13.19 GHz. Instead, Al2O3 and TiO2 devices exhibit lower fT and fmax values,
as reported in Table 2. Gain error bars at fT and fmax (Δ|h21| and Δ|MAG|,
respectively) are also listed.

Table 2 Cutoff Frequency,
Maximum Frequency of Oscillation and Error Bars for Each Oxide Group
device oxide	fT [GHz]	fmax [GHz]	Δ|h21| [dB]	Δ|MAG| [dB]	
Al2O3	10.56	9.72	±2.92	±1.00	
TiO2	7.15	6.96	±0.43	±1.20	
HfO2	16.46	13.19	±1.71	±1.07	
Starting from the DC data reported
in Figure 2, we used
the model proposed by Kim et al.30 to extract
the average contact resistance and the field-effect mobility for the
devices belonging to the three oxides groups. The results are depicted
in Figure 4a,b, respectively.

Figure 4 (a) Average contact resistance,
(b) average field-effect
mobility, and (c) ratio between the field-effect mobility and the
contact resistance for Al2O3-, TiO2-, and HfO2-based devices.

Although showing the highest field-effect mobility (μ ∼
1700 cm2/(V s)), Al2O3-based devices
exhibit the highest contact resistance (Rc ∼ 1240 Ω μm). On the other hand, the lowest value
of contact resistance has been measured in HfO2-based transistors
(Rc ∼ 480 Ω μm) together
with an intermediate value of mobility (μ ∼ 1150 cm2/(V s)) among the three oxides. Conversely, TiO2-based transistors show the lowest value of mobility (μ ∼
300 cm2/(V s)) together with an intermediate value of contact
resistance (Rc ∼ 700 Ω μm).
As expected from Raman analysis, the TiO2-based devices
show the lowest mobility; meanwhile, Al2O3-
and HfO2-based GFETs have comparable mobilities. Clearly,
since both low contact resistance and high field-effect mobility are
in principle required, these data suggest that a trade-off needs to
be found in the selection of the dielectric material.

To this
purpose, a specific figure of merit (ρμR),
defined as the ratio between the field-effect mobility and the contact
resistance, can be introduced (Figure 4c). Then, by plotting the above-defined ρμR as a function of the gate oxide, we can easily come
to the conclusion that HfO2, although having a lower κ-factor
than TiO2, allows the designer to get the best compromise
in terms of contact resistance and field-effect mobility and, consequently,
to obtain the best high-frequency performance.

These results
can be explained considering the role of both the dielectric constants
and the semiconductor/oxide band offset (Figure 5). A higher dielectric constant implies a
lower semiconductor/oxide band offset, as in the case of TiO2, if compared to Al2O3 and HfO2.
This brings a higher charge carriers transport through the potential
barrier (Figure 5b),
but worsens graphene channel modulation capability (Figure 2). For these reasons, we can
conclude that, even in graphene-based transistors, the κ-factor
is not the only parameter that designers can take into account to
improve microwave performance. In fact, a compromise between the band
offset and the κ-factor should be found and, among the three
different investigated dielectrics, hafnium oxide represents the best
choice in this sense.

Conclusions
In conclusion, in this work, we reported on a comparison among
aluminum oxide, titanium oxide, and hafnium oxide employed as gate
dielectrics in graphene field-effect transistors. We fabricated 24
identical devices for each oxide insulator and evaluated their microwave
response. We found that graphene transistors employing hafnium oxide
show the best performance in terms of both cutoff frequency and maximum
frequency of oscillation. This confirms that for graphene-based transistors,
likewise for silicon MOSFETs,21 the choice
of hafnium oxide as the gate dielectric represents a promising solution,
allowing to obtain the best compromise in terms of both contact resistance
and field-effect mobility.
