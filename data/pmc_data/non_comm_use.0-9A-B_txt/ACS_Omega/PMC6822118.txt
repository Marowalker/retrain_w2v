Iodocyclization
of 2-alkynylanisoles is an efficient route for
synthesizing substituted benzofurans. Reaction efficiency with copper(II)
sulfate and sodium iodide in an aqueous slurry under mild conditions
is a manifold higher than in organic solvents. Water-soluble hosts
of the cyclodextrin family solubilize the compounds in aqueous media
and affect the reaction efficiency through conformation control and
steric interactions. Computational chemistry and spectral titration
provide information on the host–guest complex structure and
insight into the mechanistic basis of the observed effects.

Introduction
Benzo[b]furans are frequently encountered structural
cores in natural compounds1−4 and bioactive molecules.5−11 The significance of the benzofuran framework is evidenced from its
ubiquity in plant products and prevalence as the central structures
of several biomolecules, especially antimicrobials,12−14 analgesics,15,16 and anti-inflammatory agents.7,17 This biologically useful
heterocyclic core structure is also part of several drug molecules
(Figure 1).6,18,19 Given its practical significance,
there is strong justification for the development of new and efficient
synthetic routes to access benzofurans, especially in an environmentally
benign and sustainable manner. Currently, there are several synthetic
routes reported in the synthetic organic chemistry literature for
these compounds that report excellent reaction yields and selectivity.13,14,20,21 However, there are very few reports on improving efficiency of these
reactions in a sustainable manner consistent with the principles of
green chemistry. We report a convenient and efficient method for the
synthesis of substituted benzofurans through the iodocyclization reaction
(Scheme 1) in an aqueous
environment using economic, safe, and environmentally benign reagents
(CuSO4 and NaI) under mild/moderate conditions. In the
aforementioned reaction condition, iodocyclization conversions are
at least thrice higher than the reaction in a polar protic solvent
such as ethanol. There have been no reports on the in situ generation
of I2 for iodocyclization of 2-alkynylanisoles and its
efficiency in organic and aqueous media. This work features the unusual
phenomenon of an organic reaction in an aqueous slurry and the amenability
of this reaction toward sustainable synthesis.

Water-soluble hosts, such as cyclodextrins
(CDs), calixarenes,
and micelles, have been often employed in influencing reaction rates
of reactions in aqueous media; both increase (catalysis) and decrease
(retardant) in reaction rates have been used to understand the characteristics
of the reaction in the aqueous environment. Herein, we report our
findings on the influence of cyclodextrin family on the iodocyclization
reaction rates in an aqueous environment through encapsulation. Empirical
findings of reaction rates coupled with spectral titration and computational
investigations provide information about the structural aspects of
the host–guest inclusion complex. In addition, the influence
of hosts on the reaction rates has been studied in this work, which
offers a unique insight into a previously unexplored mechanistic feature
of the iodocyclization reaction.

Scheme 1 The Iodocyclization Reaction Yielding
Benzo[b]furan
Experimental Section
The starting substrate, 1-methoxy-2-(phenylethynyl)benzene (1a), was prepared based on the previously reported procedure.22 Stock solutions of the alkyne 1a in dichloromethane and aqueous solutions of copper sulfate and sodium
iodide (separately) were prepared in standard flasks. The volume corresponding
to the required mass of the substrate was pipetted into a glass vial
and the solvent was evaporated off. To the resulting neat substrate
in the vial, the required volume of aqueous solution of reagents was
dispensed, followed by water to bring the solution to a specific dilution.
Typical concentrations of the experiment are 0.3 mmol of the substrate
in 25 mL of the aqueous medium. The durations and temperature of the
reaction are specified in Table 1. Following the reaction, the slurry was diluted with
water and subject to biphasic extraction by stirring the solution
with ethyl acetate for 5 h. The organic layer was isolated, the solvent
removed in vacuo, and the residue from the reaction analyzed spectroscopically.
The proportions of the product and reactant as well as conversions
were calculated based on the integration of peak areas in the 1H NMR spectra (Supporting Information) recorded on a 400 MHz Bruker AVANCE spectrometer.

solvent was added such that the final volume was 25 mL. The reaction
solutions were stirred at the temperatures and for the durations in Table 2. Following the reactions,
ethyl alcohol was removed in vacuo. Residue water and ethyl acetate
were added to separate the organic and the inorganic components. The
organic layer was separated and evaporated in vacuo after which the
products were dried under high vacuum and characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy.

NMR titration
was performed by obtaining a saturated solution of 1a in water by sonicating ∼7 mg of the compound in
2 mL D2O followed by removing the ppt through a syringe
filter. Then, 0.6 mL of the filtered solution was subject to NMR titration
with an addition of the powder form of cyclodextrin(s). Concentration
of the saturated solution of 1a in water was sufficient
enough to be observed in the spectrometer at with 64 scans.

Computational chemistry of the reactant and its host–guest
complexes with cyclodextrin was performed using Gaussian '09
software
package. Structures of host–guest complexes were calculated
using the ONIOM multilevel theory function in the software. The host
molecules (CDs) were treated at the molecular mechanics level (UFF)
and the guests were treated at the HF 6-31G basis set. Geometric optimizations
and frequency calculations were performed in the gas phase. All normal
mode frequencies of optimized structures were positive.

Results and Discussion
Iodocyclization
Reaction
Mixtures of copper sulfate
and sodium iodide generate molecular iodine (I2) in situ,
and the cyclization of 2-phenethynylanisole (1a) is initiated
by the electrophilic interaction of I2 with the alkyne.
The mechanism of iodocyclization reaction is understood to proceed
via the formation of a cyclic iodinium intermediate 3a (Scheme 2).23−25 This electrophilic attack triggers the electrocyclization process
involving nucleophilic assistance from the conformationally predisposed
ether functionality in the molecule. The concomitant oxonium ion intermediate 4a reinstates its neutrality through the loss of the methyl
group in the presence of the prospective counter-anion in the medium.
Due to the involvement of an electrophilic attack in the first step
and cationic intermediate that is in conjugation with aromatic rings,
substituents with electronic effects greatly influence the reaction
rates; electron donating groups increase the reaction rate, whereas
electron withdrawing groups reduce the rate.

Scheme 2 Mechanism of Iodocyclization
Reaction
Reaction in Homogeneous
Aqueous Slurry and Organic Solvents
Results from the experiments
performed at different reagent concentrations,
temperatures, and durations are outlined in Table 1. It is evident that even though the reaction
mixture was heterogeneous (the reagents and substrates were not in
the same macrophase) significant conversion was realized. This was
an intriguing finding, as the common knowledge in organic synthesis
is that maximization of the reaction speed requires complete solubility
of the reactants. While this finding was surprising, trends in the
influence of physical factors on the extent of conversion were as
expected; conversions increased progressively with time, with an increase
in concentration of reagents, and at higher temperatures.

The
conditions employed in the slurry reactions presented in Table 1 are moderate. Near-quantitative
conversion (greater than 90%) was achieved at room temperature and
in the presence of 5 equiv of copper sulfate and sodium iodide for
24 h. Presence of slightly lesser amounts of reagents (3 equiv) still
resulted in moderate conversions of around 50%. The extent of the
reaction was significantly higher than that observed for the same
reaction in organic media (vide infra). This observation provides
an applied significance for our work due to its enhancement of the
reaction rate as well as its green chemistry aspect; our work is now
expected to be an example, among few others, where the reaction rate
is higher in aqueous media compared to that in organic solvents. However,
the most notable aspect of the experimental findings is that the reaction
proceeds to a significant extent in an environmentally benign solvent,
and that without the need of solubilizing agents such as surfactants
or crown ethers.

To gain perspective regarding the efficiency
of the slurry reaction,
we compared the iodocyclization conversions to those in traditional
reaction conditions, such as a solution in the organic solvent. Hence
the experimental conditions outlined above were employed, except in
this case where alcoholic organic solvents were used. Table 2 lists the conversions achieved
in various solvents and binary solvent mixtures. The reaction conversions
were overall significantly lower than those observed using aqueous
slurry conditions. The conversions in pure organic solvents at room
temperatures were quite low, wherein for the same duration, the conversion
in the slurry was at least five folds higher. Similarly, the conversions
were many folds higher at elevated temperatures, as well as in the
presence of increased equivalents of the reagents. A comparison of
the data in Tables 1 and 2 clearly establishes the fact that the
reaction proceeds with a higher rate and improved efficiency in the
aqueous environment than in the organic solvent. Time-dependent reaction
conversion experiment followed by NMR provides a clear perspective
on the progress of the reaction (Figure S4, Supporting Information) where the ratio between proton signals
of phenylene (2a) and the methoxy (1a) is
proportional to reaction conversion. The importance of water in enhancing
the reaction rate is evident from the second entry in Table 2, wherein a 50% v/v mixture
of methanol in water was used as the reaction medium. The reaction
conversion increased noticeably (about three times higher) and was
comparable to that of the reaction in water.

Supramolecular Influence
on Reaction Rate
While solubility
of the inorganic reagents in water increases, solubility of the substrate
is starkly reduced. We hypothesized that increasing the solubility
of the substrate, acting like a phase-transfer catalyst (PTC), might
increase the reaction rate using solubilizing agents. Cavitands, especially
cyclodextrins, have been used for this purpose. One specific example
is the enhancement of the rate of cyclization of o-aminobenzamides due to its encapsulation reported by Wu et al.26 It is especially relevant due to its structural
similarity involving ring closure to form a five-membered benzofuran
ring, in which the authors demonstrated the role of CDs acting as
a PTC as well as a possible catalyst in stabilizing the reactant transition
state. Expecting a similar effect in our reaction involving cyclization
of an o-substituted substrate, we employed cyclodextrins
to act as a PTC thereby increasing reaction rates (Figure 2). Three cavitands from the
cyclodextrin family were used to solubilize the reactant in the aqueous
environment (Figure 3).

Figure 2 Encapsulation of aminobenzamides with ketones enhances cyclization
through stabilization of the transition state.26 Presence of a similar effect was explored in this iodocyclization
cyclization of alkynyl anisoles.

Figure 3 Chemical
structure of cyclodextrins, its simplified topology, and
3-D rendering in a ball-and-stick model.

Cyclodextrins (CD) are bucket-shaped oligomeric structures composed
of glucopyranose units (Figure 3, left). The hydroxyl groups of the gluropyranose on the circumference
of the upper and lower rims of the CD render the molecule water-soluble,
while the inner hydrophobic cavity encapsulates smaller organic compounds,
such as the substrate (1), in water. The hexameric, heptameric,
and octameric oligomer macrocycles are termed α-, β-,
γ-CD respectively.

The electrocyclization was performed
in aqueous under identical
conditions at room temperature as discussed earlier in the presence
of 3 equivalents of each CD oligomer (Table 3). Whereas, near quantitative conversion
was achieved in an aqueous slurry reaction in 24 h, inclusion of substrate 1a within the smallest oligomer, α-CD, resulted in a
2.4 fold decrease in conversion. This was contradictory to the expected
rate enhancement based on the originally hypothesized PTC advantage.
Similar outcome was observed for the next larger oligomer β-CD,
though the decrease in reaction rate was not as dramatic. The effect
of the largest oligomer, γ-CD, continued in the same trend,
except in this case an enhancement in reaction rate was observed compared
to the slurry reaction. Near quantitative conversion was observed
for γ-CD in less than 20 h, a significantly higher conversion
than the corresponding reaction for water in 24 h. This suggested
that the effect of CDs on the reaction rates were highly dependent
on their cavity sizes suggesting a strong supramolecular control on
the reaction mechanism as opposed to a simple PTC phenomenon.

Computational Chemistry
We aimed to understand the
effect of CDs on the reaction rates based on the computed geometry
of inclusion complexes. Geometry-optimized structures of reactants,
products, and their complexes with β-cyclodextrin (all in gas
phase) were studied. Initial analysis of the computational structures
of the reactant 1a optimized in gas phase (HF 6-31G, Figure 4) and in an aqueous
medium (SE PM6, Supporting Information)
suggested that the molecule could adopt two possible conformations
corresponding to a local minima: one in which the methyl group is
pointed away from the alkyne group (conformation 1, C1), and the second
in which the methyl group is pointed towards it (conformation 2, C2).
Conformation 2 was less stable than conformation 1 in both levels
of theory, perhaps due to the possible increased steric interaction
between the methyl and alkynyl groups. Based on this information,
we realized that our in silico studies should involve complexes of
reactants with the CDs in C1 and C2 conformations as well. 1  

Figure 4 Geometry-optimized
structures (Gaussian09, HF 6-31G) of the free
guests starting at two different conformations: nonreacting (C1, left)
and reacting (C2, right).

In the nonreacting conformation (C1), the methyl group is pointed
perpendicular to the alkynyl moiety while in the reactive conformation
(C2) it is pointed away, resulting in oxygen’s lone pair predisposed
for cyclization. The energies of geometry optimized structures of
both conformations in the three CD hosts were performed in two-level
ONIOM calculation with the lower level theory (MM, UFF) applied to
host and the higher-level theory (HF-6-31G) applied to the guests.
Geometry-optimized structures in the gas phase suggested that both
phenyl and the anisole rings are conveniently encapsulated within
the host cavities. For our analysis, we studied only structures in
which the anisole ring is encapsulated as an influence on its conformation
will have the most influence on its mechanism.

Comparing the
geometry-optimized structure of the reactant conformations
C1 and C2 included within the cavitand provided a possible explanation
for the observed change. For the unbound reactant, computational chemistry
suggests that the preferred conformation is the reactive geometry,
presumably due to coplanarity of lone pairs for conjugation. Frequency
calculations on the geometry-optimized structures allowed us to evaluate
the thermochemistry of the isomeric complex structures: C1@CD vs C2@CD
(Figure 5).

Figure 5 Geometry-optimized
of host–guest complex of 1a bound to CDs and relative
stabilities based on free energies of
formation as deduced from eq 1.

Comparison of the free energies
of the complex formation showed
that as the cavitand size increases the stability of reactive conformation
decreases and that of the nonreactive conformation increases (Figure 6). If stabilization
of the reactive geometry (due to oxygen predisposition) is the only
factor, then α-CD would be the most reactive and γ-CD
the least; however, experimentally this is not the case. Therefore,
the second factor that would influence the reaction rate is the accessibility
of the molecular iodine to the alkyne moiety to form the cyclic iodonium
intermediate. Based on the analysis of complex structures it is evident
that as the size of cavitand increases, the ability of iodine to react
with the substrate would increase. While all CDs enhance the solubility
of the substrate, the limited cavitand volume of α-CD also imposes
a steric barrier on the I2-substrate interaction, which
reduces reactivity. On the other hand, the larger cavity volume of
γ-CD is able to simultaneously encapsulate the substrate and
the reagent while also conferring the solubility advantage for the
host without imposing a steric hindrance, which increases the reaction
rate; the ability of γ-CD to form ternary complexes is well-documented
in literature.

conformer (ΔΔGstabilizationeq 1, maroon, left

Empirical Observation of
Host-Guest Complex
Complex
formation was experimentally ascertained through NMR host-guest titrations
(Figure 7). Compound 1a is soluble enough in D2O (saturated solution)
for 1H NMR analysis. Addition of aliquots of β- and
γ-CDs showed peak broadening indicating complexation. Surprisingly,
there was no observable shift in signals, which is unusual. The extent
of peak broadening was significant for γ-CD even at 1 equivalent,
while it was minimal (though noticeable) for β-CD. The extent
of peak broadening was similar for all nine aromatic protons, suggesting
complexation of the host to both the phenyl and phenoxy sides. The
presence of a single set of peaks indicated complexation kinetics
faster than the NMR time scale, consistent with a weak complexation
dynamic typically observed for CDs in general.

Figure 7 Partial 1H
NMR spectra of the saturated solution of 1a in D2O (top) and its complexes with two equivalents
of β-CD (middle) and γ-CD (bottom).

Complexation of the guest to CDs was further ascertained through
UV–vis and fluorometric titrations (section D, Supporting Information). UV–vis titration of 1a with β-CD showed increase in extinction coefficient
of the chromophore (absorbance increase) with each addition. Similarly,
there was a significant decrease in fluorescence of the chromophore
in the presence of the host compared to that of the free guest. Spectral
analysis of guest 1a in the presence and absence of water-soluble
hosts indicated inclusion complex formation, which considered along
with the NMR titration experiments, confirmed inclusion of the guest
within the cavitand. Therefore, the changes in reaction conversion
that we observed in our experiments were evidently the result of supramolecular
(weak) interactions between the host and guest.

Effect of Substituents
The effect of substituents on
the reaction outcome, performed under the reported conditions, was
explored. Two additional substrates were used, namely 4-methoxy- and
a 4-cyano-substituted derivatives. As iodocyclization involves a cationic
iodonium intermediate, it is expected that electronically activated
substrates would enhance the reaction rate and vice versa. The 4-methoxy
derivative of 1a underwent near quantitative conversion
in 20 h under unmediated conditions, while the 4-cyano derivative
resulted in no significant conversion under similar conditions (Table 4). These results were
consistent with expectations. Similar to the experiments with 1a, the reaction was performed in the presence of CDs. Consistent
with the earlier findings, the reaction conversions were enhanced
for all substrates, substantiating our hypothesis that the complexation
of substrates to CDs increases interaction between I2 and
the alkynyl bond along with PTC effect.

Conclusions
This work reports enhancement of the iodocyclization reaction of
1-alkoxyphenyl-2-phenyl acetylene in the presence of copper sulfate
and sodium iodide to yield the corresponding benzofuran. The reaction
has been observed to proceed faster in an aqueous environment as a
homogeneous slurry than in the solution in organic solvents. We speculate
that this is due to the increased solubility of the inorganic reagents
in water leading to an increase in the local concentration of the
reactants and reagents. High reaction conversions were achieved under
moderate conditions in an environmentally friendly solvent. We attempted
to improve the reaction conversions by utilizing solubilizers to enhance
the aqueous solubility of the substrate, which yielded mixed results:
the large host γ-CD enhanced reaction rate compared to the aq
slurry while the smaller hosts showing reduced rates exhibiting a
clear size-dependent trend. Energy-minimized structures of the reactant
and the complex suggested that the gradation in reaction rates is
due to the differential stabilization of two different conformations
(reactive and nonreactive) of the substrate. While all three hosts
increase solubility of the substrate in water, the smaller hosts also
prevent their reactivity through steric hinderance; the larger cavity
volume of γ-CD does not impose such physical limitation, which
results in an overall rate enhancement.
