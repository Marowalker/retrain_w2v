Dispiro-tetraoxanes, a class of fully synthetic peroxides which
can be used as an antiplasmodial remedy for multiple drug-resistant
strains of Plasmodium falciparum, were
selected for the interaction study with human serum albumin (HSA).
The insight into the interaction of the two chemically synthesized,
most potent antimalarial tetraoxane analogues (TO1 and TO2) and HSA
has been scrutinized using distinct spectroscopic techniques such
as. UV–visible absorption, fluorescence, time-resolved fluorescence,
and circular dichroism (CD). Fluorescence quenching experiments divulged
the static mode of quenching and binding constants obtained (∼104) indicated the moderate affinity of the analogues to HSA.
CD confirmed the conformational changes in the serum albumin upon
interaction with these analogues. Molecular docking validated the
empirical results as these two analogues bind through hydrophobic
interactions and hydrogen bonding with HSA. Present work first defined
the binding mechanism of dispiro-tetraoxanes with HSA and thus provides
a fresh insight into the drug transportation and metabolism. The present
study could direct toward designing more potent tetraoxane analogues
for their use in the biomedical field.

1 Introduction
Artemisinin and its semisynthetic analogues remain at the vanguard
of antimalarial chemotherapy because of their safety, high potency,
and their capability of rapid devaluation of the parasite biomass
than any other clinically used class.1 However,
recent reports witnessed the emergence and development of resistance
to the artemisinin drug which has been first documented in Western
Cambodia.2 Resistance to first-generation
analogues foster risk to decimate recent achievements attained in
reducing malaria burden worldwide and threatens the progress made
on the elimination and future control of malaria on a global level.3 Another relevant issue related to the widespread
application of aforementioned drugs is their limited availability,
high cost, and short plasma half-life that result in recrudescence
of the malarial parasite.1 These circumstances
pushed efforts toward the advancement of completely synthetic endoperoxide
alternatives with improved potency and pharmacokinetic aspects. Consequently,
researchers have sought to replace the semisynthetic artemisinin components
of ACTs with totally synthetic derivatives in order to lessen the
ambiguity regarding cost and supply and to discover structurally simplified
molecules with excellent bioavailability. This has led to the congregation
of some fully synthetic pharmacophores which carry the critical endoperoxide
bond that imparts activity to artemisinin such as 1,2,4-trioxolanes
and 1,2,4,5-tetraoxanes.4

Recently, based on the ozonide structure, a series of synthetic
molecules were developed among which OZ277 displayed very intriguing
antimalarial activity profiles in vitro and in vivo.5 However, this molecule
was found to be unstable during a phase II dose-ranging study in the
plasma of malaria patients.6 For this,
knowledge of the mode of action of the currently used drugs, understanding
of regional drug resistance patterns, and gratitude of cross-resistance
between drugs are vital to wisely design an individualized persuasive
drug policy in all malaria-affected countries.

Human serum albumin (HSA) is the most copious and versatile carrier
protein in the human body. It is a nonglycosylated polypeptide chain
comprising 585 amino acids, with a molecular weight of 65 kDa and
is responsible for the probable solubility of hydrophobic drugs in
plasma.7 Serum albumin incorporates three
homologous α-helical domains (I–III) which is further
divided into two subdomains A and B. According to the crystallographic
data, the hydrophobic cavities located in subdomain IIA (site I) and
subdomain IIIA (site II) are two primary ligand binding sites in the
albumin.8 These diversified binding sites
emphasize the exceptional ability of serum albumin to act as a major
depot and transport protein, which is adept of binding, transporting
various endogenous and exogenous substances in the circulatory system
to their target organs, and also contributing to the plasma colloid
osmotic pressure.9 The binding interaction
between drugs and plasma HSA influences its allocation and efficacy
through clasping the drug in the plasma and confining its clearance,
thus enhancing the pharmacokinetic half-life; however, this complexation
decreases the drug distribution within the tissues and can restrict
the contact of the drug with the biological target.10 Therefore, it is necessary to study the mode of interaction
of the drugs with HSA in order to comprehend the transportation and
distribution of drugs in the body on a molecular level. Further, it
will also provide theoretical direction and valuable knowledge for
designing more effective drugs.

Our research group has synthesized a series of dispiro-tetraoxane
analogues and screened for their in vitro and in vivo antimalarial activities.11 Based on the outstanding antimalarial activity and pharmacokinetic
profile, TO1 and TO2 from a pool of 37 compounds were selected as
the lead candidates (Figure 1). These molecules exhibited an IC50 value of 8.43
± 0.71 and 10.54 ± 0.81 nM against the chloroquine-sensitive
3D7 strain of Plasmodium falciparumin vitro (Table 1). At a dose level of 60 mg/kg, TO1 showed a complete
curative behavior in Plasmodium berghei within 72 h in the in vivo study, whereas, TO2
displayed complete suppression of parasites after a 5-day treatment
regimen.

To extend our research, the optimal binding models of the tetraoxane–HSA
complex were simulated through molecular docking, UV–vis absorption,
fluorescence spectroscopy, and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy.
This study supports in-depth insights into the mechanism of tetraoxane–serum
albumin binding interaction, which may be invaluable for improving
applications of tetraoxane in clinical research, and standardized
screening in pharmaceutical firms and clinical research. The result
of the present work has great significance in the study of the process
of storage and transportation of dispiro-1,2,4,5-tetraoxane in the
body and its mechanism of action and pharmacokinetics.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 UV–Vis Absorbance
UV–vis
absorption spectroscopy is a widely employed technique for the analysis
of drug–protein interactions. The absorption spectra of HSA
exhibits a strong peak at 280 nm because of the π–π*
transition of Trp, Tyr, and Phe amino acids.12 Here, the UV spectra of free TOs as well as protein–TO complexes
were recorded. It was observed that TOs do not absorb in the range
of protein absorption (Figure 2b inset). The spectra of free protein and in the presence
of various concentrations of TO1 and TO2 was taken to understand the
interaction mechanism. It was noticed that absorption of HSA increased
with successive addition of TO1–2 without any shift in the
absorption peak (Figure 2). The observed hyperchromicity in both the cases implied toward
the stable ground-state complex formation between HSA and TO1–2.13 Further, the absence of blue or red shift in
the absorption spectra implied toward the binding of TO1–2
to HSA via the π–π stacking type of noncovalent
interactions.14 This change in absorption
spectra also confirmed the static nature of quenching as absorption
spectra are unaffected by dynamic quenching.15

Figure 2 UV–visible absorbance spectra of HSA (10 μM) in the
absence and presence of different concentrations of (a) TO1 and (b)
TO2 (pH = 7.4, T = 298 K). The upward arrow shows
an increasing intensity upon the addition of TO1 and TO2. Absorbance
spectra of TO1 and TO2 (90 μM) are presented in the inset of Figure 2b.

2.2 Fluorescence Quenching
Fluorescence
spectroscopy being a sensitive technique is used to analyze the structural
and conformational changes during the complex formation between the
protein and the ligand. HSA has a unique property of intrinsic fluorescence
because of the three aromatic amino acid residues tryptophan, tyrosine,
and phenylalanine.16 HSA showed an emission
peak at 340 nm with excitation at 280 nm.17 The fluorescence of the free tetraoxanes TO1 and TO2 (150 μM)
was also recorded with an excitation wavelength at 280 nm to check
whether these analogues produce peak in the region of protein emission.
It was observed that these analogues do not show any fluorescence.
Further, to elucidate the interaction mechanism, emission spectra
of HSA (10 μM) were recorded by varying the concentration of
TO1–2 to it (Figure 3). It was observed that fluorescence was quenched by the successive
addition of TO1–2 to HSA. Thus, it can be deduced that the
Trp residue of HSA is situated at or nearby to the ligand binding
site.18 The decrease in fluorescence intensity
indicated the binding of TO1–2 to the protein and also it can
be deduced that binding is concentration dependent.19

Figure 3 Fluorescence quenching of HSA (10 μM) in the presence of
different concentrations of (a) TO1 and (b) TO2 excited at 280 nm
at 298 K. Inset: fluorescence spectra of (a) TO1 and (b) TO2 (150
μM) excited at 280 nm.

The blue shift observed in the fluorescence emission maxima reflected
toward the change in polarity around the chromophore unit of the protein.
This shift indicated that the amino acid residues are located in a
more hydrophobic environment.20 The fluorescence
quenching can be of two types: static quenching and dynamic quenching.
So, the mechanism of quenching was assessed by evaluating the fluorescence
spectra by means of Stern–Volmer equation 1  Here, the symbol F0 represents the fluorescence intensity of pure HSA, F represents the fluorescence intensity of HSA in the presence of
the quencher, [Q] denotes the quencher concentration, and kq is the quenching constant. The constant KSV or kqτ0 is the Stern–Volmer constant.21 Here, τ0 was taken 10–8 s for
calculating kq. In our case, we found
that the quenching constant (kq) is larger
than the maximum diffusion rate constant of the biomolecule (2 ×
1010 L mol–1 s–1) (Table 2). So, it can be concluded
that the mechanism of fluorescence quenching was due to complex formation
between HSA and TO1–2.22 The Stern–Volmer
plots of titration of HSA with TO1–2 are shown in Figure 4.

K (λex = 280 nm, pH = 7.4). Data presented are mean
values ± standard deviations of three independent experiments;
some error bars are within symbol.

TO2	2.56 ± 0.0035	2.56 ± 0.0035	1.0727 × 104	1.104	
Fluorescence results were further analyzed to determine the number
of binding sites and binding constants by the following modified Stern–Volmer
equation23 2  

The values of the binding constant Kb (intercept) and n (slope) were calculated by plotting
log[(F0 – F)/F] against log[Q] as shown in Figure 5. In this case, the value of the slope (n) came out was close to 1 for both the cases (for TO1 and
TO2), indicating 1:1 binding stoichiometry.24 The calculated values of the binding constant (Kb) as shown in Table 2 are of the order 104 (L mol–1) for HSA–TOs showing a moderate interaction in high affinity.24b Hence, by the fluorescence quenching experiment
and the calculated values of binding parameters, it can be deduced
that TO1–2 forms a static complex with HSA in 1:1 stoichiometry.

TO2 at 298 K (λex = 280 nm, pH = 7.4). Data presented

some error bars are within symbol.

2.3 Time-Resolved Fluorescence
The steady-state
fluorescence quenching concluded the static nature of quenching of
HSA by TO1–2. Further to differentiate between static and dynamic
quenching and to affirm the mechanism of quenching precisely, time-resolved
fluorescence measurements were performed (Figure 6). As fluorescence lifetime does not depend
on the quencher concentration in case of static quenching, it decreases
with the increasing quencher concentration for dynamic quenching.10 Thus, the lifetime values of HSA in the absence
and presence of varying concentrations of TO1–2 were investigated.
As can be seen from Figure 6, the fluorescence decay profiles of HSA remained almost unaffected
even after the addition of a varying concentration of TO1–2.

Figure 6 Fluorescence decay profile of HSA in the absence and presence of
varying concentration of (a) TO1 and (b) TO2 at 298 K.

The average fluorescence lifetime (τ) of HSA was determined
on the basis of the decay time and relative amplitude (α), using
the below equation 3  

The attained values for the relative fluorescence life time of
HSA in the presence and absence of TOs are shown in Table 3. The average fluorescence life
time of HSA reduced from 4.25 to 4.21 ns in the presence of TO1. This
negligible decrease in the fluorescence life time implied toward the
static nature of the quenching mechanism.25 Thus, the steady state fluorescence experiment as well as time resolved
measurements proved the static mode of quenching.

[TO2]/[HSA] = 3:1	2.34	6.83	43.05	56.94	4.89	
2.4 CD Spectroscopy
CD being a sensitive
and informative tool, which is frequently used to investigate the
conformational changes in protein upon drug–protein interaction.
CD spectroscopy of HSA in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) was carried
out in the far-UV region (190–240 nm), which reflected two
significant negative minima at 208 and 222 nm. These two negative
minima at 208 and 222 nm belongs to the π–π* and
n−π* transition of the α helix and random coil
of the protein.20a

Figure 7 shows that on subsequent addition
of TOs to HSA, by regular increment of 1 μM each time from a
molar concentration ratio (HSA/TOs) 1:0 to 1:1, the decrease in intensity
and gradual shift of the 208 peak toward 222 nm was observed in all
the cases. This decrease in intensity reflected toward the disruption
in the secondary-structure conformation of the protein.26 Further, it was also observed that on successive
addition of TO1–2 to HSA, the content of the α-helix
decreases abruptly from 56.31 to 22.13 and 24.58% in case of TO1 and
TO2, respectively (calculated from K2D3 software). Thus, unfolding
of the α-helices is predominant with increasing concentration
of TO1–2, which is in good agreement with UV-absorption and
fluorescence studies.

Figure 7 CD spectra of HSA (10 μM) in the absence and presence of
different concentrations of (a) TO1 and (b) TO2 (HSA/TOs ratio = 1:0
→ 1:1).

2.5 Computational Studies
Theoretical
calculations for both TO1–2 were done using density functional
theory (DFT) studies. the hybrid functional DFT/B3LYP/6-31+G(d) method
was employed using Gaussian software for excellent precision and speed
of calculations.27 The TO1–2 geometries
were optimized in the ground electronic state, and the energies for
these were minimized. These optimized TO1–2 geometries were
further used for calculating the energies of frontier molecular orbitals,
that is, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). Owing to the importance of these
frontier molecular orbitals and their associated properties, to conclude
the reactivity and charge delocalization within the molecule, GaussView
5.0 was used for visualizing and constructing the shapes of frontier
molecular orbitals of TO1–2.

It is reported that the
molecules having large and small HOMO–LUMO gaps correlates
to the less and more reactive species, respectively.20a Here, HOMO–LUMO gaps of TO1–2 were found
of approximately similar values. Nevertheless, the lower HOMO–LUMO
gap obtained for TO1 supports the more bioactive molecule in comparison
to TO2, which is in good agreement with the experimental in
vitro antiplasmodial activity.11

The HOMO and LUMO plots of TO1–2 (Figure 8) show the charge delocalization within these
molecules upon excitation. In case of TO1 (Figure 8a), it can be seen that the HOMO is completely
delocalized over the sulfonyl and attached side chain, while the LUMO
is completely delocalized over the tetraoxane ring in the molecule.
Hence, the HOMO–LUMO plots display the charge transfer toward
the cyclic ring within the molecule.

2.6 Molecular Docking Studies
Before
the molecular docking assay, the HSA 3D crystal structure (PDB ID: 1E78) was downloaded
from the Protein Data Bank.28 Molecular
docking between tetraoxanes (TO1–2) and HSA was achieved using
AutoDock to find out the interacting residues of the protein. AutoDockTools
version 1.5.6 which is the graphical user interface of the AutoDock
equipped with MGLTools was employed to find the interaction modes
between TOs and HSA. The three-dimensional structure of ligands (TO1–2)
was constructed using ChemBio3D Ultra12.0. The structures of tetraoxanes
(TO1–2) were optimized using Gaussian 09W software. All bound
water molecules and heteroatoms were removed from the HSA crystal
structure, and essential hydrogen atoms and Gasteiger charges were
added to the protein using the AutoDockTools. The implemented Lamarckian
genetic algorithm (LGA) in AutoDock was adopted to check out the feasible
conformation of the tetraoxanes upon the binding with HSA. Docking
of both TO1–2 with whole of the protein was achieved in order
to ascertain the comparative affinity of binding sites of proteins
for these ligands, adopting the identical grid size of 256 Å
along both three (X, Y, and Z) axes, covering all the protein and grid spacing of 0.375
Å.29 By docking results, 50 conformers
were assessed and the conformer having lowest binding energy was chosen
for further examination (Tables S1 and S2, Supporting Information). The results obtained after visualizing using
PyMol are shown in Figure 9. Docking results showed that TO1 bind within the binding
pocket of the subdomain IIA of HSA through H-bonding (with Asp324
and Lys212) and hydrophobic interactions with various amino acid residues.
Similarly, TO2 forms H-bonding with Lys212 and surrounded by various
hydrophobic amino acid residues of HSA (Table 4). Further, from Figure 9, it can be seen that the Trp-214 residue
is in close vicinity in both the cases. These docking results further
support the adequate fluorescence quenching of serum albumin in the
presence of these analogues, that is, TO1 and TO2. From the cluster
analysis, using a root-mean-square (rms) deviation tolerance of 2.0
Å, different conformational clusters were found for both TO1
and TO2 as shown in Figure 10.

3 Conclusions
The present study includes a sequential analysis of interaction
mechanism of two potent antimalarial tetraoxane analogues to HSA,
using different spectroscopic and computational techniques. The hyperchromicity
obtained in UV–vis spectra displayed the interaction of tetraoxanes
with HSA. Fluorescence quenching results confirmed the static nature
of the quenching mechanism as the values obtained for the quenching
constant (∼1012) were greater than scatter collision
(∼1010). The values of the binding constant (∼104) demonstrated a moderate and reasonable binding of TO1–2
to HSA, divulging that their clearance from kidneys and diffusion
into the tissues decreases. Also, the tetraoxane (TO1), having a longer
alkyl side chain bearing a Cl atom exhibited a greater value of the
binding constant (Kb) as compared to the
other one (TO2). The results obtained from CD confirmed that these
tetraoxanes induced conformational changes in the secondary structure
of HSA upon interaction. Further, molecular docking studies concluded
that these analogues bind with strong affinity to HSA at the Sudlow
site IIA in close proximity to Trp-214 through hydrophobic interaction
and H-bonding.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials
All the chemicals and materials
used in the experiments were of analytical grade. Fatty-acid-free
HSA (A3782-1G) was procured from Sigma-Aldrich, India. The stock solution
of HSA (10 μM) was prepared using phosphate-buffered saline
(pH 7.4, 10 mM) and stored in a refrigerator to a maintain temperature
of 2–6 °C. The stock solutions of TO1 and TO2 (10 mM)
were prepared in 1% dimethyl sulfoxide. Further, working solutions
of TO1 and TO2 were prepared by dilution of the stock solution with
buffer. Millipore water was used to prepare the buffer.

4.2 UV–Visible Absorption Spectrum Experiments
The UV–visible absorption spectra at room temperature was
recorded by a double-slit UV–visible spectrophotometer (JASCO
V-670) using a quartz cuvette of dimension 1.0 × 1.0 cm. The
HSA concentration was kept constant (10 μM), while the concentrations
of the ligands were varied from 0 to 90 μM in intervals of 10
μM.

4.3 Fluorescence Spectroscopy Experiments
The fluorescence spectra of free HSA in the presence of TOs were
recorded using a Varian Cary Eclipse spectrophotometer arrayed with
a 1.0 cm quartz cell, in the range 290–500 nm. An excitation
wavelength of 280 nm was set, and excitation and emission bandwidths
were kept at 5 nm. A scanning speed of 200 nm/min was set. HSA concentration
was kept constant (10 μM), and the molar concentration ratios
of TO1–2 to HSA were varied.

4.4 Time-Resolved Fluorescence Spectroscopy
The HORIBA Yvon lifetime spectrophotometer was used to carry out
the life time decay experiment. The time-correlated single-photon
counting technique was used to evaluate the lifetime decay owing to
its high optical efficiency and temporal resolution. An excitation
pulse of 1.2 nm at a repetition rate of 1 MHz was sourced from NanoLED.
Time-resolved fluorescence spectra were recorded for native HSA and
in the presence of different concentrations of TO1–2.

4.5 CD Spectroscopy
A CD spectrometer
(JASCO-810, Japan) furnished with a thermo-stated cell holder at a
room temperature was operated using a quartz cuvette of 10 mm path
length and 190–250 nm spectral range was selected for CD spectroscopy.
Nitrogen was regularly purged into the spectropolarimeter in order
to absorb the condensed water throughout the experiment. Each scan
was obtained after subtracting scans of the buffer for baseline correction.
The scan speed was fixed at 100 nm/min with 1 s response time and
1 nm bandwidth. The final spectra correspond to the average of three
accumulations. Each spectra was analyzed by the web-based software
package, K2D3, to evaluate the percentage of the α-helix.30

4.6 Computational Analysis
Gaussian 09W
software was used to optimize the geometries of tetraoxanes, and these
optimized geometries were used for DFT calculations. The AutoDock
1.5.6 program was employed to achieve molecular docking of tetraoxanes
(TOs) and HSA. The HSA crystalline structure with the entry code 1E78 was obtained from
the Protein Data Bank online database for molecular docking. All the
water molecules and heteroatoms were deleted. Thus, polar hydrogens
and Kollman charges were added, and Gasteiger charges were calculated.
Ligand (TO1 and TO2) PDB files were introduced into AutoDockTools
(ADT), and the rigid roots and rotatable bonds were defined. The grid
size was set to 256 × 256 × 256 along three X, Y, and Z axes with 0.375 Å
spacing. LGA was used as the search engine with population size: 150,
maximum number of energy evolutions: 2,500,000, maximum number of
generations: 27,000, an elitism of 1, mutation rate: 0.02, and crossover
rate: 0.8. The resulting 50 conformations were clustered by setting
rms to 2.0 Å. All the docked simulations are extracted and analyzed
and aimed to determine least energy conformation. The best scored
rank results are given in Tables S1 and S2 (Supporting Information). The PyMol molecular graphics system (DeLano Scientific,
San Carlos, USA, version 0.99rc6) was used to analyze the docked conformations.
