The effect of natural emulsifiers
(whey protein isolate, WPI; modified
lecithin, ML; and gum arabic, GA) on the formulation, stability, and
bioaccessibility of fucoxanthin-loaded oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions
was determined in this study. The fine emulsions were prepared under
high-pressure homogenization at 100 MPa for 4 passes, using 2 wt %
WPI, ML, and GA, resulting in emulsions with the droplet sizes of
136, 140, and 897 nm, respectively. The chemical stability of fucoxanthin
in the emulsions after long-term storage at ambient temperature decreased
in the following order: WPI > GA > ML. The release of free fatty
acids
of fucoxanthin, studied by in vitro digestion, decreased in the following
order: WPI > ML > GA > bulk oil. The bioaccessibility of
fucoxanthin
in emulsions stabilized by WPI, ML, and GA after in vitro digestion
were 92.5 ± 6.8%, 44.6 ± 0.4, and 36.8 ± 2.5, respectively.
These results indicate that natural emulsifier type and concentration
used significantly affects the formulation, stability, lipid digestion,
and fucoxanthin bioaccessibility, which may be ascribed to the different
properties of each emulsifier. The bioaccessibility of fucoxanthin
was improved by using emulsion-based delivery systems.

1 Introduction
With the constant pursuit
of better life quality and healthier
lifestyle, consumers are increasingly concerned about their health,
and paying more attention to nutraceutical ingredients, such as vitamins
and carotenoids. Fucoxanthin, a marine carotenoid found in brown seaweed,
with a distinctive allenic bond in the 5,6-monoepoxide and hydroxyl
groups, is an accessory pigment in the chloroplasts and is involved
in photosynthesis.1 Fucoxanthin is known
to possess many beneficial properties, including antioxidant,2,3 anticancer,4,5 anti-inflammatory,6 anti-obesity, and antidiabetic effects.7,8 A
previous study investigated the effect of fucoxanthin supplementation,
using ThinOgen, on body fat in overweight humans.9 The results revealed that subjects in the treatment group
(fucoxanthin 2–4 mg/day intake) showed a significant reduction
in weight, compared to that by subjects in the placebo group. Moreover,
another research illustrated that consumption of fucoxanthin-fortified
milk leads to enhanced bioaccessibility of fucoxanthin in in vitro
and in vivo models.10 Therefore, fucoxanthin
can be considered as a nutraceutical ingredient and can be utilized
in the food industry and other fields to design new and improved nutraceuticals.
However, as with other carotenoids, fucoxanthin is affected by light,
oxygen, heat, and pH.11,12 Owing to its many limitations,
such as its poor water-solubility (0.5 ppm), high melting point (166–168
°C), chemical variability, and low bioaccessibility,13,14 there are many challenges to its incorporation into nutraceutical
products.

Food-grade emulsions are widely used in cosmetics,
pharmaceuticals,
foods, and beverages.15 Various studies
have indicated that emulsions could improve the stability and the
bioavailability of nutraceutical ingredients when incorporated into
dispersed phase droplets. O/W emulsion-based delivery systems are
quite suited to encapsulate lipophilic bioactive ingredients due to
the dispersion of small lipid droplets in the continuous phase. These
droplets can efficiently pass through the skin and enhance the penetration
of the components.16,17

Previous studies have demonstrated
successful encapsulation of
highly purified fucoxanthin into nanoemulsions, nanoparticles, and
other spray-dried powders.10,18−21 Most of them focused on the stability and bioaccessibility of fucoxanthin,
which were affected by carrier oils (corn oil, medium chain triacylglycerol
oil, orange flavor oil, and restructured lipids) and dispersions (whole
milk and skimmed milk). Meanwhile, there is limited information about
the comparison of various types of emulsifiers. For instance, fucoxanthin-loaded
nanoemulsions were successfully prepared and characterized with Tween
80. Fucoxanthin-loaded nanoparticles of casein and chitosan showed
improved bioavailability due to high absorption and entry into the
blood.18 There are no reports about using
crude fucoxanthin extract and different naturally occurring emulsifiers
for the formulation of fucoxanthin-loaded emulsions.

This study
aimed to utilize natural emulsifiers instead of synthetic
surfactants to formulate emulsions, which are sustainable and label
friendly. Natural emulsifiers are mainly classified into protein-based
emulsifiers, phospholipid-based emulsifiers, and polysaccharide-based
emulsifiers. It is an established fact that emulsifiers are crucial
to the formulation and stability of emulsion-based systems and that
they protect emulsions against destabilizing processes. In this study,
we utilized three natural emulsifiers: whey protein isolate (WPI),
modified lecithin (ML) and gum arabic (GA) to formulate emulsions.
We also evaluated the effects of the emulsifier type and concentration
on the physicochemical stability of emulsions encapsulating fucoxanthin.
WPI (mainly consisting of β-lactoglobulin and α-lactalbumin)
is widely used as a food-grade emulsifier in food and beverage products.16 Hydrophilically modified phospholipid, which
is hydrolyzed by soy lecithin, was used in this study. ML has a low
molecular weight (about 650 g/mol), and because of its zwitterionic
nature, it can stabilize emulsions by electrostatic repulsions during
processing and storage. In addition, GA is generally utilized as an
amphiphilic polysaccharide in the food industry (in juices and candies).
It is a soluble dietary fiber, with specific properties due to a complex
mixture of polysaccharides and glycoproteins. In this study, we evaluated
the effects of the emulsifier type and concentration, apart from homogenization
parameters, on the formulation and stabilization of fucoxanthin-loaded
O/W emulsions. Subsequently, the characteristics of the emulsions,
including the volume mean diameter, droplet size distribution, physicochemical
stability, and fucoxanthin retention, were investigated. Moreover,
we also investigated the effects of different emulsifiers on the in
vitro digestion behavior and bioaccessibility of fucoxanthin by evaluating
the amount of free fatty acids (FFAs) released and fucoxanthin concentration
in the micellar phase.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Influence of Emulsifier Type and Concentration
on the Formulation of Fucoxanthin-Loaded O/W Emulsions
The
influence of the type of emulsifier and their concentration on the
formulation of fucoxanthin-loaded O/W emulsions, using standard homogenization
conditions (100 MPa, 4 passes), was investigated. The droplet size
and size distribution are presented in Figure 1a. The freshly prepared-emulsions stabilized
by 2 wt % WPI, ML, and GA exhibited narrow droplet size distribution
with small droplet sizes (d4,3) of = 136,
140, and 897 nm, respectively. The d4,3 of emulsions decreased with increasing concentration of the respective
emulsifier. The decrease in d4,3 at low
emulsifier concentrations (Figure 1b) can be attributed to the fact that there was not
sufficient emulsifier available to adsorb at oil/water interface during
homogenization.22 At high emulsifier concentrations,
the d4,3 values remained constant because
the disruptive energy of the homogenizer was not enough for further
size reduction.23 Fine droplets with the
minimum droplet diameters (d4,3) of ≈128
nm (WPI), ≈137 nm (ML), and ≈611 nm (GA), respectively,
were obtained at high emulsifier concentrations (4 wt %). The difference
in droplet size was likely due to the contribution of the different
emulsifiers to the interfacial behavior. ML dissolved in Milli-Q water
had smaller interfacial tension than Milli-Q water, which was favorable
for formulating small droplets. In contrast, the higher interfacial
tension for WPI and GA can be ascribed to their large-molecular structures,
which prevent close packing of the points of contact at the interface.24 The coalescence of droplets occurred due to
the splitting of droplets in a short period of time, in the homogenizer,
which could not be fleetly stabilized by the large-molecule emulsifiers
due to their low adsorption kinetics.25 For WPI and GA, a smaller droplet size of emulsions formulated was
observed. This could be explained based on the structural change in
WPI during homogenization. There might be more hydrophobic groups
exposed by the protein chain due to unfolding during adsorption. GA
has a 21–28 nm gyration radius of globular configuration, and
it is not as good a protein in reducing interfacial tension.26 Therefore, under the same conditions, WPI may
be faster and more efficient in covering the droplet surface than
GA, thus resulting in the formulation of smaller droplets.

types of emulsifiers and their concentrations
on the formulation of emulsions, encapsulating fucoxanthin, prepared
by using high-pressure homogenization at 100 MPa for 4 passes. (a)
Droplet size distribution of emulsions stabilized by ML (d4,3 = 140 nm), WPI (d4,3 =
136 nm), and GA (d4,3 = 897 nm). (b) d4,3 of emulsions stabilized by different concentrations
of emulsifiers.

2.2 Influence
of Homogenization Pressures and
Number of Passes on the Formulation of Fucoxanthin-Loaded O/W Emulsions
Homogenization parameters, such as pressure and the number of passes,
are very crucial for the size of droplets generated using high-pressure
homogenization. In our study, the effect of different homogenization
pressures (20–140 MPa, Figure 2a) and the number of passes (0–10 passes, Figure 2b) on the droplet
size were evaluated by monitoring the d4,3 of the emulsions stabilized by 2 wt % of emulsifiers. Pass 0 refers
to the use of only the rotor-stator homogenizer without high-pressure
homogenizing. With increasing homogenization pressure and pass, the
disruption energy increased together with a decrease in the d4,3.27 However, the d4,3 of GA-stabilized emulsions slightly increased
from 760 to 904 nm. This phenomenon could be interpreted by the interdigitation
of carbohydrates and protein denaturation in GA during the high-pressure
process, which hindered the emulsifying capacity of GA.25 Meanwhile, after 80 MPa and 3 passes, there
was no distinct change in d4,3. The d4,3 of WPI- or ML- stabilized emulsions decreased
from 389 to 134 and 275 to 137 nm, respectively. Importantly, the
chemical stability of fucoxanthin during the homogenization of emulsions,
homogenized by different number of passes was also investigated. After
the homogenization by using a rotor-stator homogenizer (pass 0, Figure 2b), the chemical
stability of fucoxanthin during homogenization fell to nearly 65–80%
which meant around 20–35% of fucoxanthin degraded in this process.
Therefore, the first step in the homogenization process has a crucial
effect on the degradation of fucoxanthin. On the other hand, there
was a gradual decrease in the chemical stability of fucoxanthin during
homogenization with increasing number of passes during the high-pressure
homogenization process. Although the changes were minimal, the impact
of this aspect should not be ignored. The chemical stability of fucoxanthin
during homogenization in WPI-, ML-, or GA-stabilized fresh O/W emulsions
were 72.7, 65.6, and 56.0%, respectively. This phenomenon can be explained
by the following three factors: (i) during high-speed homogenization,
the coarse emulsions were exposed
to the atmosphere, and oxygen might be entrapped in the emulsions.
(ii) After preparing the coarse emulsions, the dispersed phase was
separated from the continuous phase rapidly. Even if high-speed homogenization
can provide strong shear force, it is still a failure to make the
emulsifiers to fully adsorb on the surface of droplets and formulate
a better droplet form. (iii) During the high-pressure homogenization,
because of the high energy input, free radicals may have been formed
as fucoxanthin is sensitive to thermal energy.28

Figure 2 Effect of homogenization pressure and number of passes on the formulation
of emulsions. The d4,3 of emulsions formulated
using different (a) pressure and (b) number of passes. The chemical
stability during homogenization was also determined on emulsions homogenized
by different number of passes. Pass 0 refers to the results of rotor-stator
homogenization.

2.3 Storage
Stability of Fucoxanthin in O/W Emulsions
The stability of
the emulsion is a critical factor to determine
the shelf-life of foods and beverages. Storage stability of fucoxanthin
in emulsions stabilized by different types of emulsifiers (WPI, ML,
or GA) was investigated during storage at 25 °C, up to 15 days.
Because of the unsaturated structure, fucoxanthin is sensitive to
heat, light, and oxidative degradation during processing and storage.
Therefore, all samples were covered by aluminum foil and stored in
the dark.

2.4 Physical Stability of Long-Term Storage
Figure 3 illustrates
the results of d4,3 of fucoxanthin-loaded
emulsions stabilized by different emulsifiers (WPI, ML, or GA) during
storage up to 15 days, at 25 °C. During storage, emulsions showed
excellent physical stability and there was no prominent broadening
in d4,3, when stabilized by WPI or ML.
WPI can form physically strong layers, which could avoid the coalescence
of droplets by steric hindrance on the interface between oil and water.29 ML-stabilized emulsions contained tiny particles
which could counter the gravitational force with Brownian motion.
Furthermore, the droplets carry a negative charge, which might inhibit
flocculation.30 Meanwhile, visible creaming
occurred on top of the emulsion stabilized by GA. GA is an emulsifier
with a large molecular structure and a high interfacial tension, which
might result in relatively large droplets leading to a higher buoyancy
force.

Figure 3 Effect of different types of emulsifiers on the physical stability
of fucoxanthin-loaded emulsions during 15 days of storage at 25 °C.

2.5 Chemical
Stability of Fucoxanthin during Storage
The chemical stability
of fucoxanthin during storage was measured
by using eq 2. As shown
in Figure 4, the chemical
stability of fucoxanthin at day 0 was deemed as 100%, which decreased
in all emulsions during storage. The chemical stability of fucoxanthin
during storage of emulsions stabilized by ML or GA was lower than
the detection limit at day 3 and day 10, respectively. After storage
at 25 °C for 15 days, the chemical stability of fucoxanthin during
storage decreased from 100 to 59.5% in WPI-stabilized emulsions and
55.5% in the case of bulk oil. The main factors that cause the degradation
of fucoxanthin during storage are emulsifier type, surface area of
the droplets, and the formation of free radicals during the high-pressure
process.31 According to a previous study,
the degradation of the carotenoid may be due to a chemical reaction
on the surface, at the interface of oil and water, which may be slower
in rate due to the smaller surface area.32 Although WPI- and ML-stabilized emulsions had larger surface area,
the latter was easier to be oxidized and decomposed, owing to more
contact between oil and water, resulting in fucoxanthin exposure to
oxygen. ML is the small molecular emulsifier, whose molecular weight
is around 650 g/mol. It can be closely contacted and adsorbed on the
surface of oil drop with a thin layer. WPI contains cysteyl residues,
thiol functional groups, and disulfide bonds, which might inhibit
lipid oxidation by scavenging free radicals in emulsion systems.33 Additionally, the layer of adsorbed WPI might
be considered as a thicker physical barrier than ML at the interface
of oil and water and prevent fucoxanthin degradation.34 Therefore, WPI can alleviate the degradation of fucoxanthin
because of its good antioxidant activity, as well as excellent emulsifying
properties. Moreover, as a large molecular emulsifier, GA has higher
interfacial tension. The droplet size was extremely larger in the
GA-stabilized emulsion than in others. Although the surface area of
droplets in GA-stabilized emulsion was smaller, it is not as good
as WPI to prevent the degradation of fucoxanthin.

Figure 4 Effect of the type of
emulsifiers on the chemical stability of
fucoxanthin-loaded emulsions as compared to bulk oil, during 15 days
of storage at 25 °C.

2.6 Lipid Digestion
The particle size
drastically increased after the exposure of emulsions to the small
intestinal phase, regardless of the emulsifier type. The initial d4,3 of emulsions stabilized by WPI, ML, or GA
were around 136, 140, and 897 nm, which increased to 123, 108, and
121 μm, respectively, after digestion in the small intestinal
phase (Figure 5). Other
studies also suggest that the droplets in emulsions aggregate and
are resistant to in vitro digestion.20,35,36 This phenomenon might be due to the lipid digestion
products, such as colloidal particles, micelles, bilayers, liquid
crystals, or vesicles, that are generated due to the hydrolysis of
triacylglycerol molecules by lipases in the small intestinal phase.35,37 Notably, fatty acids, monoacylglycerols, and bile salts can produce
mixed micelles in the small intestinal fluid.38,39 Moreover, the insoluble calcium-fatty acid soaps may be formulated
during digestion.20 On the other hand,
the interfacial and core characteristics may change and lead to droplet
aggregation.

Figure 5 The d4,3 of fucoxanthin-loaded
emulsions
formulated with different types of emulsifiers during in vitro digestion
(initial and small intestine).

In the in vitro digestion study, the emulsifier type has
an important
influence on the lipid digestion rate and level.40 Lipid digestion was defined as FFA (%) values throughout
digestion time (min) and monitored by a pH-stat method. Moreover,
we compared the FFAs released in bulk oil and emulsions (Figure 6). For the bulk oil,
we observed very little amount of initial FFAs being released (about
5.9%), which can be explained by the fact that most of the bulk oil
cannot be digested. The release of FFAs in emulsions was quite faster
and higher than that in the bulk oil because the surface area of emulsion
droplets was larger than the one of bulk oil. The larger surface area
can promote the interaction of oil droplets with the lipase to enhance
rapid FFAs release.41 This also explained
the reason why FFAs released in GA-stabilized emulsions were lower
than those in emulsions formed by other emulsifiers. In previous studies,
the FFAs in Tween 20- or Tween 80-stabilized emulsions were rapidly
released. However, in our study, the FFAs release was slow during
the digestion. The possible mechanism can be explained by the shielding
effects of Ca2+, which were added in the digestion phase.
Tween 20 and Tween 80 are nonionic emulsifiers, whereas WPI, ML, and
GA are anionic emulsifiers. The anionic charged droplets can be aggregated
or flocculated by the screening effect with the cationic Ca2+. Therefore, the rate of FFAs release observed in this study was
much slower than previous studies.

Figure 6 Effect of the types of emulsifiers on
the FFAs released during
in vitro small intestine digestion.

2.7 Chemical Stability and Bioaccessibility of
Fucoxanthin during Digestion
In our study, the chemical stability
of fucoxanthin during the digestion in WPI-stabilized emulsion was
almost 100%, whereas the one in ML-stabilized emulsions was only 53.6%
(Table 1). However,
previous studies suggested no significant degradation of astaxanthin
and β-carotene before and after digestion.40,42 This result has shown that the oxidation and degradation of the
bioactive compound during digestion is highly dependent on the sample
and emulsifier types. The chemical structure of fucoxanthin contains
an allenic bond and conjugated carbonyl group, which provide the unique
features of fucoxanthin. The chemical stability of astaxanthin and
β-carotene was not as active as fucoxanthin. Moreover, WPI can
act as an excellent emulsifier which alleviates the degradation of
fucoxanthin. GA-stabilized emulsions had the large volume mean diameter
and low FFAs released related to a large amount of oil floated on
the digestive fluid, hence, it was difficult to detect the chemical
stability of fucoxanthin after digestion. The same situation also
occurred with the bulk oil.

condition.

The bioaccessibility
of fucoxanthin was highly dependent on the
type of emulsifier in the emulsions and was determined as the fraction
of fucoxanthin merged with the mixed micelles in the micellar phase
after digestion by using in vitro gastrointestinal digestion model.
It is noticeable that the bioaccessibility of fucoxanthin was drastically
improved by using emulsion-based delivery systems. The bioaccessibility
of fucoxanthin in samples followed the order: WPI (92.5%) >ML (44.6%)
> GA (36.8%) > bulk oil (ND), and correlated inversely with
the order
of the initial droplet size. Especially, the retention of fucoxanthin
in the micelles of WPI-stabilized emulsions rose up to 68.4% which
was drastically higher than those in the bulk oil. For emulsions,
lipolysis was more rapid and sufficient with smaller initial droplets.
Different studies also indicated that the initial droplet size of
dispersion has a significant influence on the generation of micelles
and the lower bioaccessibility of β-carotene with increasing
initial droplet size.42,43

Although the high-pressure
homogenization method can improve the
bioaccessibility of fucoxanthin, its drawbacks should not be neglected. Table 1 shows that with further
processing and digestion, the proportion of fucoxanthin retention
decreased in every step. The reasons for the decrease of Rf, such as high energy input, exposure to oxygen, and
some other reasons, have been discussed above. Therefore, further
studies are needed to solve the issues of reducing the degradation
of fucoxanthin during processing and digestion.

In the present
study, fucoxanthin could be successfully incorporated
into O/W emulsions which were stabilized by WPI, ML, or GA. WPI and
ML were able to formulate emulsions with smaller droplets. In contrast,
GA-stabilized emulsions resulted in larger droplets. The long-term
storage experiments showed that all emulsions exhibited good physical
stability during storage for 15 days at 25 °C. The Rf in emulsions was highly dependent on the natural emulsifier
type. Emulsions stabilized by WPI had the highest retention of fucoxanthin,
probably due to the antioxidant properties of WPI. The in vitro digestion
experiments indicated that emulsion-based delivery systems could notably
enhance the bioaccessibility of fucoxanthin compared to that by bulk
oil. Moreover, the type of natural emulsifier has a major effect on
the lipid digestion and bioaccessibility. The release of FFAs and
bioaccessibility of fucoxanthin in WPI- or ML-stabilized emulsions
were higher than in the case of GA-stabilized emulsions. This was
attributed to the lipid digestion and highly relied on the initial
droplet size along with the larger surface area which could increase
the lipolysis rate and FFAs release. The findings reported herein
can provide valuable information about the bioaccessibility of hydrophobic
bioactive compounds, such as fucoxanthin, which can be improved by
using emulsion-based delivery systems formulated through high-pressure
homogenization method.

3 Materials and Methods
3.1 Materials
Fucoxanthin extract samples
(ThinOgen fucoxanthin oil 5%, fucoxanthin purity 5% by HPLC) were
kindly donated by BGG-Japan Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). The source of
fucoxanthin extract was Laminaria saccharina (L.) Lamouroux (Alga Kombu)-Syn:Laminaria japonicaor Undaria pinnatifida, Harvey (Wakame Algae). Medium-chain triacylglycerol (MCT-7) oil
was purchased from Taiyo Kagaku Co., Ltd. (Mie, Japan). The triacylglycerol
in MCT was reported to contain around 25% capric acid and 75% caprylic
acid and polyglyceryl-5-laurate. WPI was procured from Nichiga, Japan
Garlic Co., Ltd. (Gunma, Japan). ML (SLP whitelyso) was purchased
from Tsuji Oil Mills Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). ML is a mixture of
different phospholipids and contains lysophosphatidylcholine (18–30%),
phosphatidylinositol (10–20%), phosphatidylcholine (2–8%),
phosphatidylethanolamine (1–7%), and phosphatidic acid (0–5%).
GA was purchased from Fujifilm Wako Pure Chem., Co. (Osaka, Japan).
All other chemicals used were of analytical grade. Double distilled
water (Milli-Q water) was used for the preparation of all solutions
and emulsions.

3.2 Formulation of Fucoxanthin-Loaded
O/W Emulsions
The dispersed phase was prepared by dispersing
4 wt % fucoxanthin
extract in MCT oil and stirred at ambient temperature, overnight,
to ensure that fucoxanthin completely dissolved. The samples were
refined by passing through a poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) syringe
filter (0.45 μm) to eliminate undissolved particles. The continuous
phases were prepared by dissolving 0.01–4 wt % emulsifiers
(WPI, ML, or GA) in Milli-Q water and 0.02 wt % antimicrobial agent
(sodium azide) was added. The fucoxanthin-loaded O/W emulsions were
prepared by homogenizing the 10 wt % dispersed phase and the 90 wt
% continuous phase at ambient temperature. Initially, coarse emulsions
were homogenized by using a rotor–stator homogenizer (polytron,
PT-3000 Kinematica-AG, Littace, Switzerland) at 10 000 rpm
for 5 min and then passed through a high-pressure homogenizer (NanoVater,
NV200, Yoshida Kikai, Japan) at a pressure range of 20–140
MPa for 0–10 passes to obtain the fine emulsions.

3.3 Characterization of Fucoxanthin-Loaded O/W
Emulsions
A laser diffraction particle size analyzer (LS
13 320, Beckman Coulter, Brea, USA) was used to determine the droplet
size and size distribution of the freshly prepared emulsions. This
device works on the principle of laser diffraction to calculate the
particle size distribution via the pattern of light scattered by the
particles in the samples. It can measure particle size within the
range of 0.04–2000 μm. The refractive indices for water
and MCT oil were set at 1.333 and 1.450, respectively. The volume
mean diameter (d4,3) was obtained for
the average droplet size. All samples were measured in triplicate.
The chemical stability of fucoxanthin during homogenization was calculated
using eq 1, as follows 1  where C0 is the
actual fucoxanthin concentration in freshly prepared emulsions, and CInitial is the fucoxanthin concentration calculated
from the initial amount added.

3.4 Storage
Stability of Fucoxanthin-Loaded Emulsions
The emulsion samples
were stored in glass test tubes with screw
caps after preparation and incubated in dark at 25 °C, for up
to 15 days for observation. The d4,3 and
chemical stability of fucoxanthin during storage, in the emulsions,
were measured throughout the storage time. The chemical stability
of fucoxanthin during storage in the emulsion samples was determined
using eq 2, as follows 2  where Ct is the actual fucoxanthin concentration in the emulsions at
a specific time during the storage, and C0 is the actual fucoxanthin concentration in freshly prepared emulsions.

3.5 Measurement of Fucoxanthin Concentration in
Emulsions
The concentrations of fucoxanthin in the emulsions
and bulk oil were quantified using HPLC (JASCO International Co.,
Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an AS-2055 autosampler, a PU-980 pump
system, and a UV-970 UV–vis spectrophotometric detector. A
C-18 reversed phase column (as stationary phase, 4.6 × 250 mm;
Shimpack VP-ODS, Japan) was used with the temperature set at 25 °C.
Fucoxanthin was extracted from emulsions and the dispersed phase prior
to the HPLC analysis using a solvent extraction method: 200 μL
of emulsion or a drop of dispersed phase (mass was analyzed) from
the middle of the glass test tube was diluted to 10 mL with methanol
in a volumetric flask to extract fucoxanthin and then ultrasonicated
for 5 min. The samples were filtered using PTFE syringe filters (0.45
μm) and transferred to 2 mL HPLC vials; 20 μL of the filtered
samples from HPLC vials were injected into the HPLC system. The mobile
phase consisted of 10 wt % of Milli-Q water and 90 wt % of methanol.
The mobile phase flow rate was set at 1 mL/min. UV detection of fucoxanthin
was monitored at 450 nm. Fucoxanthin concentration in samples was
calculated using a standard curve (R2 =
0.9995) and all of the analyses were repeated three times.

3.6 In Vitro Gastrointestinal Digestion
An in vitro gastrointestinal
tract (GIT) model composed of gastric
and intestinal phases was used in this study. There was a slight modification
in the methodology, from previous studies, to simulate the biological
fate of ingested samples.20,44−46 The samples were diluted two times with Milli-Q water in order to
have 5 wt % oil before passing through the GIT model.

3.7 Gastric Phase
The simulated gastric
fluid (SGF) was prepared by dissolving 7 mL of HCl (35–37%)
and 2 g of sodium chloride in 1 L of Milli-Q water, and then 3.2 g
of pepsin was added. HCl (1 mol/L) was used to adjust the pH of SGF
to 1.2. The diluted emulsions (15 g) were mixed with SGF (15 g), and
the obtained mixture contained 2.5 wt % oil. NaOH (1 mol/L) was used
to adjust the pH of the samples to 2.5. The samples were maintained
under continuous agitation at 250 rpm for 2 h at 37 °C.

3.8 Small Intestinal Phase
After the
gastric digestion step, 30 g of the sample was adjusted to pH 7.0
immediately by using NaOH solution (1 mol/L). The simulated small
intestinal fluid (SSIF) contained 1 mL of calcium chloride (110 mg/mL)
dissolved in Milli-Q water and 4 mL of freshly prepared bile extract
(46.87 mg/mL) dissolved in phosphate buffer (5 mM, pH 7.0). The SSIF
was added into the samples and the pH was adjusted to 7.0. Subsequently,
2.5 mL of freshly prepared lipase suspension (24 mg/mL) dissolved
in phosphate buffer (5 mM, pH 7.0) was incorporated into the mixture.
The samples were transferred to clean beakers and incubated in a water
bath with controlled temperature (37 °C) and continuous agitation
at 250 rpm. During 2 h of the small intestinal digestion process,
NaOH solution (1 mol/L) was manually titrated into the mixture to
maintain a pH of 7.0. The pH of the samples was monitored and NaOH
solution was titrated to neutralize the FFAs released during the lipid
digestion.47 The volume of NaOH solution
(L) was recorded throughout the digestion. The amount of FFAs released
was calculated using eq 3, as follows 3  where VNaOH(t) is the
volume (L) of NaOH solution (1 mol/L) titrated
into the samples to neutralize the FFAs released at a certain digestion
time (min), MNaOH is the molarity of NaOH
solution used (mol), Moil is the molecular
weight of the MCT oil (490 g/mol), and Woil is the initial mass (g) of the oil present in the reaction system.

3.9 Determination of Chemical Stability and Bioaccessibility
of Fucoxanthin during Digestion
After the in vitro digestion,
10 mL of raw digesta was immediately collected and centrifuged (10 000g, MX-307 centrifuge, Tomy Digital Biology Co., Ltd., Tokyo,
Japan) at an ambient temperature for 60 min. After centrifugation,
samples were separated into three phases: a thin oil phase on top,
a transparent micellar phase in the middle, and a sediment phase at
the bottom.40,46 Fucoxanthin was assumed to be
solubilized in the micellar phase. The extracted fucoxanthin from
the raw digesta phase and micellar phase was collected and passed
through a PTFE syringe filter (0.45 μm). Samples were added
into an organic solvent (methanol) to extract fucoxanthin and, then,
ultrasonicated for 5 min. The transparent phase was quantified using
HPLC as described in Section 2.5. The chemical stability and bioaccessibility of fucoxanthin
during digestion, and fucoxanthin retention (Rf) were calculated using eqs 4–6, respectively, as indicated
below 4   5   6  where fucoxanthin concentration in the raw
digesta and micellar phase are CDigesta and CMicellar, respectively. C0 is the actual fucoxanthin concentration in
freshly prepared emulsions. CStep is the
actual fucoxanthin concentration in the samples at every step (homogenization,
storage, digestion, and bioaccessibility), and CInitial is the fucoxanthin concentration, which is calculated
from the initial amount added.

3.10 Statistical
Analysis
Each experiment
was performed at least twice. Statistical analysis was performed using
analysis of variance at a confidence level of 95%. Statistix 8.1 software
(Tallahassee, USA) was used to calculate the least significant difference
based on the method described in a previous report.48
