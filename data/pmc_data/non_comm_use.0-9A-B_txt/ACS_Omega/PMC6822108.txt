Triboelectric
nanogenerators (TENGs) are smart alternative energy
harvesters to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy to
power small and portable electronic devices. A key challenge in fabricating
an efficient TENG lies in the choice of an active material in addition
to the mechanical stability and robust output performance of the device.
This report suggests, for the first time, the use of a peritoneum
membrane as a triboelectrically positive material for designing TENGs.
The peritoneum covers the abdominal wall and diaphragm of mammals
except for the kidneys and the adrenal glands and consists of a structure
of a well-defined network of elastic fibers. Our peritoneum-based
TENG (p-TENG) can generate an open-circuit output voltage of ∼550
V, output current density of ∼100 mA m–2,
and instantaneous output power density of 9.4 Wm–2. This work demonstrates the p-TENG as a portable power source, a
self-powered pedometer, and a speedometer, which conveys its futuristic
applications for health care purposes. Our p-TENG is highly stable,
delivering a constant output voltage of ∼550 V over a period
of 90 days. The introduction of a biowaste peritoneum membrane as
a triboelectrically positive component in the TENG has great potential
as a portable alternative energy source owing to its abundance, stability,
low cost, and ease of fabrication.

Introduction
The search for a clean
alternative energy source with reduced carbon
emission is crucial for sustainable development of human civilization.
Hence, it is essential to develop novel renewable, environment-friendly,
and cost-effective technologies.1−6 Rapid development of the electronics industry has generated a variety
of essential portable electronic gadgets, which are powered by conventional
battery sources. However, conventional batteries have limited energy
storage capacities and limited lifetimes and add considerable additional
weights to the electronic gadgets. Alternatively, mechanical energy
sources are abundant in nature and easily accessible in the ambient
environment. Human motion is one of such easily accessible mechanical
energy sources to generate power. In this regard, nanogenerators based
on piezoelectricity and triboelectricity have appeared recently as
an alternative green power source for harvesting mechanical energy,
converting it into electrical energy that could power small and portable
electronic devices.7−20 A variety of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) relying on human
motion-driven mechanical energy has been developed to date.21−28 The working principle of TENGs relies on the periodic contact electrification
effect between two active materials with different charge affinities.29,30 Hence, a key challenge in fabricating an efficient TENG lies in
the choice of an active material in addition to the mechanical stability
and robust output performance of the device. In this regard, several
works have been reported to find new triboelectric-positive and triboelectric-negative
materials.31,32 In this work, we are introducing
the peritoneum membrane as a triboelectric-positive material for the
first time. The peritoneum covers the abdominal wall and diaphragm
of mammals except for the kidneys and the adrenal glands.33 The peritoneum consists of a single layer of
mesothelial cells covering a basement membrane. The basement membrane
is a well-defined network of elastic fibers containing glycosylated
proteins, mast cells, macrophages, and lymphocytes.33 The introduction of the eco-friendly peritoneum membrane
as a triboelectrically positive component with high output performance
has great potential for realizing the robust alternative energy source
for powering portable electronic gadgets. It helps to expand the field
toward a biocompatible and low-cost green energy harvester. Herein,
we report, for the first time, the use of the peritoneum membrane
as a triboelectric-positive material to design an ambient stable TENG
(p-TENG) in combination with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The p-TENG
with an area of 4 × 4 cm2 can deliver a high open-circuit
output voltage of 550 V with an output current of 160 μA, defining
a power density of 9.4 Wm–2. Our p-TENG can be used
as a direct power source to power more than 100 commercial blue LEDs.
We demonstrate the capacitor charging ability using the p-TENG, which
is further used as portable storage devices for powering commercial
LED strips. Additionally, we demonstrate the use of the p-TENG as
an electrical energy harvester from mechanical energy of human walking.
We show that the p-TENG can be used as a step counter of human walking
and as a self-powered pedometer for health care applications. Our
p-TENG generates a constant open-circuit output voltage of 550 V over
a period of 90 days, suggesting the robust mechanical stability.

Results
and Discussions
The peritoneum membrane preparation method
is presented in Figure 1a. First, the peritoneum
membrane of a goat was collected from a slaughterhouse and immersed
in lime water for 24 h.

Schematic of an arc-shaped p-TENG device. (e) Photograph of the p-TENG
device.

The membrane was then cleaned
with fresh water several times and
kept in sunlight for 48 h in a stretched condition. Finally, a flat
peritoneum membrane is obtained upon drying. The thickness of the
membrane was measured to be 0.3 mm using digital Vernier calipers. Figure 1b shows a photograph
of an as-prepared dried peritoneum membrane. We have examined the
surface morphology of the as-prepared peritoneum film using scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) (Figure 1c). The SEM image reveals that the membrane consists
of a network of fibers with a highly rough surface morphology. Such
a rough morphology of the peritoneum film is useful for triboelectrification
since it provides improved friction with a counteractive material
film in the TENG. The PDMS film and peritoneum membrane were stacked
separately with polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates using
conductive adhesive carbon tape. Finally, the PET substrate with PDMS
and PET substrate with the peritoneum membrane were attached together
with scotch tape in such a manner that the PDMS and peritoneum membrane
remain in a face-to-face configuration (Figure 1d). Using this process of fabrication, p-TENGs
with different active areas of 2 × 2, 3 × 3, and 4 ×
4 cm2 were prepared. There exists reports on the design
of TENGs based on the vertical contact separation between the triboelectrically
active materials.34−38 We have designed a prototype arc-shaped device structure, where
the working mechanism is based on the vertical contact and separation
mode between PDMS and the peritoneum membrane under externally applied
force. A top-view photograph of the fabricated p-TENG is presented
in Figure 1e. We have
used PDMS as a negative triboelectric material and the biological
peritoneum membrane as a positive triboelectric material in the p-TENG.
The effective friction takes place between the peritoneum membrane
and PDMS to produce a large number of triboelectric charges during
friction upon application of external mechanical forces. To probe
the triboelectric-positive nature of the peritoneum membrane, we have
carried out a control experiment using a steel plate and an oscilloscope.
The steel plate was rubbed with the peritoneum membrane a few times
and connected to the oscilloscope probe. A negative voltage pulse
in the oscilloscope was obtained (Figure S1a in the Supporting Information), suggesting that the steel plate
acquired negative charges after the friction with the peritoneum membrane.
Since steel is located in the middle of the triboelectric series,
the control experiment univocally suggests that the peritoneum membrane
is a triboelectrically positive material.39,40 The position of peritoneum membrane is presented in Figure S1b in the Supporting Information. The
elemental analysis suggests that the peritoneum membrane consists
mainly of four elements, which are carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and calcium
(Figure S2 in the Supporting Information).
These elements are responsible for the positive nature of the peritoneum
membrane in the triboelectric series. A high dielectric constant (Figure S3 in the Supporting Information) at a
low frequency (5 Hz) with a microstructured network fiber reveals
that the peritoneum membrane is a good candidate in the field of TENGs.

The working principle of the p-TENG is described in Figure S4 in the Supporting Information. Upon
application of an external force on top of the p-TENG using the palm
of a hand, friction is produced between the peritoneum membrane and
the PDMS film, generating charges. As a result, the peritoneum membrane
surface becomes positively charged, and the PDMS film surface
becomes negatively charged. Therefore, charge pairs formed at the
interface of the peritoneum membrane and the PDMS film when both are
in contact. These positive and negative charges are static charges
on the surfaces of both of the films. Since the charges of opposite
kinds are confined on the surfaces and coincide at the interface of
the two films, there is practically no electro-potential difference
between the electrodes when the two films are in contact (Figure S4a in the Supporting Information). Upon
withdrawal of the force, two films are separated from each other due
to the restoring force of PET substrates. Therefore, an electro-potential
difference is created as the positive and negative charge surfaces
are separated from each other. To reduce the electro-potential difference,
electrons flow from the electrode attached to the PDMS film to the
electrode attached to the peritoneum membrane through the oscilloscope
(Figure S4b in the Supporting Information).
This generates a negative pulse on the oscilloscope. This charge flow
in the external circuit stops when the distance between the two film
surfaces is maximum, and the potential difference between the peritoneum
and PDMS films is fully balanced by the induced charges on the opposite
electrodes (Figure S4c in the Supporting
Information). Once the p-TENG is pressed in the next cycle, the electro-potential
difference between the peritoneum and PDMS films starts to decrease
as the two film surfaces come closer to each other (Figure S4d in the Supporting Information). While pressing,
the electrons flow from the electrode attached to the peritoneum membrane
to the electrode attached to the PDMS, generating a positive pulse
on the oscilloscope. The p-TENG attains an electrical equilibrium
condition when the two films are in contact mode (d ≈ 0), and the potential difference reaches zero or close
to zero, and hence, no current flow is obtained (Figure S4a in the Supporting Information). The cyclic repetition
of this contact and separation cycle causes periodic current generation
from the p-TENG in the external circuit.

Electrical output characteristics
for the 4 × 4 cm2 p-TENG are presented in Figure 2. The open-circuit
output voltage of the p-TENG reaches
550 V when the gap between the two triboelectric materials is ∼2
cm (Figure 2a). The
asymmetry in the positive and negative peaks is attributed to the
difference between the external force applied on the device and the
restoring force of PET substrates. The approaching time of the peritoneum
membrane and PDMS film depends on the magnitude of applied external
force, which is higher than the restoring force of PET substrates.
This results in a larger positive voltage compared to the negative
voltage. The output current of the p-TENG was calculated by measuring
the voltage across a 100 kΩ resistor. The output current reaches
160 μA, resulting in an output current density of 100 mA m–2 (Figure 2b). The absolute transferred charge through the external circuit
connecting the two electrodes attached to the PDMS film and peritoneum
membrane is calculated by integrating a single positive current pulse.
The transferred charge is found to be 0.08 μC, corresponding
to a transferred charge density of 50 μC m–2 (Figure 2c). The
absolute transferred charge during the releasing time is depicted
in Figure S5 in the Supporting Information.
The variation of the output voltage signal and output power of the
p-TENG with different load resistances is illustrated in Figure 2d. With the increase
in resistance, the voltage increases, showing a maximum value at 1
GΩ (Figure 2d).

Figure 2 Electrical
output characteristics of the p-TENG with an effective
area of 16 cm2. (a) Open-circuit output voltage of the
p-TENG. (b) Output current of the p-TENG. (c) Plot of transferred
charge during approaching time of the two films. (d) Output voltage
(blue dots and curve) and output power (red dots and curve) of the
p-TENG at different load resistances.

The instantaneous output power reaches a maximum value of 15 mW
for a 5 MΩ resistance, corresponding to a power density of 9.4
W m–2 (Figure 2d). This indicates that our p-TENG is the most efficient
for this output load. We have also taken an open-circuit voltage
of the p-TENG with the peritoneum membrane dried in different conditions.
The measurement shows that slow drying or faster drying of the peritoneum
membrane does not have any effects on output voltage (Supporting Information, Figure S6). The output performance of the p-TENG
relies on the magnitude of the applied forces. Due to the absence
of a force measurement setup, we could not measure the applied force
by hand. However, we have carried out a force-dependent output response
experiment by dropping iron blocks of different masses from a fixed
height on the p-TENG and calculating the force. The result is presented
in the Supporting Information (Figure S7).

We have also measured the spacer-dependent open-circuit
output
voltages by varying the gap between the two triboelectric-active materials
in the device. For this purpose, we prepared the p-TENG with the same
effective area of 4 × 4 cm2; however, the gap between
the two electrodes was varied to 0.5, 1, and 1.5 cm. The p-TENG with
a gap of 0.5, 1, and 1.5 cm showed output voltages of 430, 485, and
510 V, respectively (Figure S8 in the Supporting
Information). A close observation reveals that the positive voltage
amplitudes are 310, 295, and 270 V for 1.5, 1, and 0.5 cm spacer distances,
respectively. Hence, the positive voltage amplitudes do not change
largely compared to the 320 V for a 2 cm spacer distance. However,
the negative voltage amplitudes are significantly lower compared to
the 225 V for a 2 cm spacer distance. The negative voltage amplitudes
for three different spacer distances are −200, −190,
and −160 V for 1.5, 1, and 0.5 cm spacer distances, respectively.
We attribute the change in the negative voltage amplitudes to the
change in the restoring force of the PET substrates. The positive
peak arises due to the external force applied by the palm of a hand,
while the negative peak arises due to the restoring force of the PET
substrate, which reduces with decreasing spacer distance for the arc-shaped
nature of the p-TENG.

Figure 3 represents
a comparative study of the open-circuit output voltages for the p-TENG
with different active areas of 2 × 2, 3 × 3, and 4 ×
4 cm2. The open-circuit output voltages were measured to
be 360, 460, and 550 V, respectively (Figure 3a).

output voltage
for three devices with different active areas. (b) Output voltage
with respect to increasing effective area of the devices. (c) Output
current measured through a 100 kΩ resistor for three devices
with a different active area. (d) Output current with respect to increasing
effective area of the devices.

A linear increase in the output voltage is observed with an increase
in the device size of the p-TENG (Figure 3b). Output currents measured through a 100
kΩ external resistance are found to be 0.05, 0.1, and 0.16 mA
for 2 × 2, 3 × 3, and 4 × 4 cm2 devices,
respectively (Figure 3c). The output current also shows a linear relationship with the
device area (Figure 3d). Corresponding power outputs are calculated to be 5.7, 12,
and 15 mW for 2 × 2, 3 × 3, and 4 × 4 cm2 devices, respectively (Figure S9 in the Supporting Information).

To show the realistic applications of the p-TENG, we have checked
the stability of the device for a number of operational cycles. Our
p-TENG resulted in an open-circuit output voltage of ∼550 V
over 6000 cycles (Figure 4a). However, 6000 cycles is an apparent number considering
our data acquisition procedure. We applied the external force manually
by striking with the hand due to the lack of availability of an automatic
force generator instrument. Since our oscilloscope can save data of
10 s time frame at a time, we saved each 10 s data before repeating
the next striking cycle. Additionally, striking the p-TENG with the
hand often results in an unequal voltage amplitude. In order to acquire
equal voltage amplitude within the 10 s time frame, we had to strike
the device for a few additional minutes. We have shown 120 sets of
such 10 s data cycles with a 5 Hz frequency, implying 6000 cycles
of equal voltage amplitude (Figure 4a). Realistically, we had to strike the p-TENG almost
over 80,000 cycles for 3 days by hand to acquire the displayed 6000
cycles of equal voltage amplitude. Again, we have carried out additional
experiments for stability test for 15,000 cycles using a low-powered
linear motor (electrical sewing machine), where the applied vertical
force on the device is very low. The plot shows that it is highly
stable over a large number of cycles (Supporting Information, Figure S10).

6000 cycles of periodic

capacitance values charged by the p-TENG. (e) Snapshot of an LED strip

We have also tested the mechanical durability of our p-TENG
over
a time span of 90 days by applying 1500 cycles of periodic force at
a regular interval of 30 days. We obtained a constant output performance
with an open-circuit output voltage of 550 V, suggesting the mechanical
robustness of the p-TENG with negligible degradation over 3 months
(Figure 4b). The mechanical
stability of the peritoneum membrane was tested using the tensile
testing system. The stress versus strain curve indicates that the
peritoneum membrane has very high mechanical stiffness (Figure 4c). The peritoneum membrane
exhibits an ultimate tensile strength (UTS) value of 14 MPa, an elongation
at break (EB) value of 14.75%, and a Young modulus of 0.94 MPa (Figure 4c). The mechanical
strength measurements justify the high stability of the p-TENG over
a prolonged operational cycle over a long period of time. To demonstrate
that the p-TENG is capable of charging a battery or a supercapacitor
to store the electrical energy for future applications, we used the
p-TENG to charge commercial capacitors with capacitance values of
1, 2.2, 3.2, and 10 μF. The p-TENG was connected to the capacitor
by a bridge rectifier, and the output voltage across the capacitor
was measured simultaneously upon application of an external periodic
force of 3 Hz. The transient response is presented in Figure 4d. The voltage reaches a maximum
value of 31 V for a capacitance of 1 μF, 13.5 V for 2.2 μF,
7.9 V for 3.2 μF, and 1.9 V for 10 μF over a capacitance
charging time of 120 s. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of stored
voltage in the capacitor as a portable power source. We used a 1 μF
charged capacitor as a power source to power a commercially available
white LED strip (power rating: 12 V, 12 W) (Figure 4e). Additionally, for direct application
as a power source, we have powered ∼100 commercial blue LEDs
(single LED power rating: 3.2 V, 25 mW) with the p-TENG (Figure 4f, Video S1 in the Supporting Information). The output performance
of our p-TENG is compared with other triboelectric-positive materials
in Table S1 of the Supporting Information.
The comparison suggests that our device is more efficient and robust.

Earlier reports demonstrated the use of the TENG for electrical
energy harvesting from human walking.41−53 We show that our device is useful to extract electrical energy from
human motion and suitable for the application as a pedometer/speedometer.
We attached the p-TENG to a shoe using double-sided tape (Figure 5a). The p-TENG generates
electrical energy during walking, which is demonstrated by powering
LEDs (Figure 5b). Moreover,
we can use the p-TENG as a pedometer of human walking (Figure 5c) since the p-TENG is able
to register every step of human motion (Video S1 in the Supporting Information). Two types of peaks are observed
during voltage pulses by walking: one is for pressing the device by
the heel, and the other is for releasing the device by the heel (Figure 5d,e). The number
of peaks represents the number of steps during human walking, suggesting
that the p-TENG can be used as a self-powered speedometer. A speedometer
can record the number of steps, distance travelled, and speed of walking/running.
The distance traveled (s) can be calculated by using
the equation s = n × ι
where n is the number of steps and ι is each
step length. The number of steps thus can be calculated from the number
of voltage peaks generated from the device while walking. In the case
of normal walking, the length of each step of an adult is approximately
0.6 m, and the length extends to nearly 1.2 m for running. Hence,
the average walking/running speed (v) can be calculated
using the equation v = ι/t where t is the time taken by each step, which is
calculated to be 0.6 m/s for normal human walking.

and releasing the p-TENG by the heel of the leg while walking. (d)

Conclusions
In summary, we report
the fabrication of a new stable, low-cost,
lightweight, and environment-friendly p-TENG using peritoneum membrane
and PDMS combinations for harvesting ambient mechanical energy. The
development of an abundant bio-friendly peritoneum membrane for designing
the p-TENG for mechanical energy harvesting is novel. Electrical output
characteristics of the p-TENG reveal a high open-circuit output voltage
of ∼550 V with a short circuit current of ∼160 μA,
generating an output power of ∼15 mW with a high-power density
of 9.4 Wm–2. We demonstrated the application of
the p-TENG as a direct power source by powering 100 commercial blue
LEDs and a white LED strip. On the other hand, the p-TENG can charge
capacitors as storage devices, which can be used further as portable
storage devices for powering LED strips. The p-TENG can be fitted
with shoes, treadmills, or doormats to convert mechanical energy into
electrical energy during human motion activity. We also demonstrated
the usefulness of the p-TENG as a step counter during human walking
and as a self-powered speedometer for possible health care applications.
Moreover, the p-TENG is highly stable and can deliver a constant output
performance for a large number of operational cycles. The wide range
of applications, simple design, cost-effectiveness, and stability
of the p-TENG demonstrates the potential to meet the requirement of
low-power portable electronic gadgets as a green energy source.

Experimental
Section
PDMS Film Preparation
PDMS solution was prepared by
mixing a silicone elastomer and a curing agent (Sylgard 184, Dow Corning
Co.) at a quantity ratio of 10:1 (w/w). The solution was stirred for
1 h at room temperature for homogeneous mixing of the elastomer and
the curing agent. The mixture was then kept in a vacuum for half
an hour to remove the air bubbles that appeared due to mechanical
agitation during stirring. The solution then was drop-cast on a glass
plate and spread with a glass slide. It was then placed horizontally
for 15 min to attain its uniform thickness before placing it on top
of a hot plate for about half an hour at 110 °C for thermal curing.
The prepared film was measured to be 0.2 mm with digital Vernier calipers.

Peritoneum Membrane Film Preparation
The peritoneum
membrane of a goat was collected from a slaughterhouse. It was immersed
in lime water for 24 h. The membrane was then cleaned with fresh water
and kept in sunlight for 48 h in a stretched condition to prepare
a flat peritoneum membrane. The thickness of the film was measured
to be 0.3 mm.

p-TENG Fabrication
PDMS and the
peritoneum film were
stacked individually with the PET substrate using conductive adhesive
carbon tape. Our peritoneum membrane and PDMS-based p-TENG was fabricated
in an arc-like structured pattern using two rectangular PET substrates
as top and bottom substrates (0.5 mm thickness). The carbon conductive
adhesive tape with a thickness of 0.16 mm was attached to both of
the concave surfaces of the PET substrate as the electrode. Carbon
tape is flexible and has good mechanical strength. Hence, it can withstand
forces externally applied on the p-TENG. Finally, the PET substrate
with PDMS and the peritoneum film were attached together face to face
with scotch tape. In this process, three p-TENGs were prepared with
three different active areas of 2 × 2, 3 × 3, and 4 ×
4 cm2.

Characterization
SEM measurements
were carried out
using a ZEISS Sigma FE-SEM to examine the morphology and surface feature
of the peritoneum membrane. The image was captured at an operating
voltage of 15 kV. The electrical output performance of the p-TENG
was characterized by applying periodic forces manually with the palm
of a hand. The top electrode was pressed by periodic tapping. The
open-circuit output voltage was measured using a digital oscilloscope
(Yokogawa DL 1620). The corresponding output current was measured
by taking the voltage across a 100 kΩ resistor. The external
circuit connection was made by connecting the channel of the oscilloscope
to the electrode attached to the PDMS film. We have carried out the
tensile tests for the peritoneum membrane of uniform thickness (0.3
mm) using a universal testing machine (Zwick Roell, model Z005) with
a constant stretching speed of 5 mm/min at room temperature (30 °C).
