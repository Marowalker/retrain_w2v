Drug delivery by
nanoparticle carriers has been limited by inefficient
intracellular drug delivery. Temperature-responsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm)-modified liposomes can release their
content following heating. In this study, we synthesized the temperature-responsive
polymer poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-co-N,N′-dimethylaminopropylacrylamide
(P(NIPAAm-co-DMAPAAm)) and investigated the properties
of liposomes modified with P(NIPAAm-co-DMAPAAm) for
intracellular drug carriers. The copolymer displayed a thermosensitive
transition at a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) that is
higher than body temperature. Above the LCST, the temperature-responsive
liposomes started to aggregate and release. The liposomes showed a
fixed aqueous layer thickness (FALT) at the surface below the LCST,
and the FALT decreased with increasing temperature. Above 37 °C,
cytosolic release from the temperature-responsive liposomes was higher
than that from the PEGylated liposomes, indicating intracellular uptake.
Here, we showed that the tunable surface properties of the temperature-responsive
polymer-modified liposomes possibly enabled their dehydration by heating,
which likely induced a faster cellular uptake and release. Therefore,
the liposomes could be highly applicable for improving intracellular
drug-delivery carriers.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Drug
delivery by nanoparticle carriers is an attractive strategy
for cancer therapy to enhance therapeutic efficacy while reducing
side effects.1 In particular, PEGylated
liposomes prepared by the conjugation of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)
to the liposome surface have been widely used to enhance the accumulation
of liposomes in tumor tissues through enhanced permeability and retention
effects mediated by their long circulation time.2−5 However, the hydration layer of
the PEGylated liposomes creates a major drawback because of its limited
cellular uptake of carriers and cellular release of drug content from
liposomes.6,7 Strategies to overcome the drawback of limited
drug release include stimuli-responsive liposomes that trigger drug
release using external stimuli such as temperature and pH. In particular,
temperature is mostly used to trigger the release of temperature-responsive
liposomes.8,9

Temperature-responsive liposomes are
classified into two types:
traditional temperature-responsive liposomes composed of temperature-responsive
lipids and liposomes modified with temperature-responsive polymers.10 The traditional temperature-responsive liposomes
show the greatest permeation of the lipid membrane at its gel-to-liquid
crystalline phase transition temperature. The temperature-responsive
liposomes remain intact at 37 °C and exhibit a site-specific
drug release from the liposomes following heating above 37 °C.
An example of this type of temperature-responsive liposomes loaded
with doxorubicin, ThermoDox, reached phase III trials in 2014.11 In addition, liposomes modified with temperature-responsive
polymers exhibit a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) behavior.
The polymers are soluble in an aqueous solution at a low temperature
but are dehydrated and aggregated by heating above the LCST. Liposomes
modified with temperature-responsive polymers show an enhanced release
above the polymer LCST. Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)
(PNIPAAm) shows an LCST behavior at approximately 32 °C.12,13,14 The polymer LCST can be modulated
by copolymerization with other monomers.15 PNIPAAm and its copolymers have been widely used for the modification
of liposomes.16,17

In most cases, the temperature-responsive
liposomes described so
far rapidly release the entrapped drug before cellular uptake following
heating, as intended. This results in drug penetration through the
cell membrane by simple diffusion.10 Nanoparticles
and liposomes are internalized into cells by endocytosis. PEGylated
liposomes penetrate cells slowly and, therefore, exhibit a limited
release of their content in the cells due to low affinity for the
cell membrane because of the steric barrier of PEG.6,7 Temperature-responsive
polymer-modified liposomes activated by heating are useful as intracellular
carriers for hydrophilic, high-molecular-weight, and biodegradable
drugs, such as peptide and gene products that cannot penetrate membranes
and are expected to enhance the cellular drug uptake and subsequently
release their content.

However, to the best of our knowledge,
the surface properties of
PNIPAAm-copolymer-modified liposomes for intracellular drug delivery
have not been reported to date. To increase the intracellular uptake,
PEGylated traditional temperature-responsive liposomes modified with
ligands and antibodies18−20 as well as temperature-responsive polymer-modified
liposomes conjugated with antibody and exposed to ultrasound have
been reported.21−23 Moreover, interestingly, nanoparticles without liposomes,
including our temperature-responsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)–poly(lactic
acid) (PNIPAAm–PLA) nanoparticles,24 temperature-responsive poly(ε-caprolactone) micellar nanoparticles,25 poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-co-N,N-dimethylaminoethyl
methacrylate (PNIPAAm-co-DMAEMA) nanoparticles,26 PNIPAAm-chitosan-modified magnetite nanoparticles,27 and poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-block-poly((3-acrylamidopropyl)trimethylammonium chloride)
(PNIPAAm–PAMPTMA) polymer complex with siRNA,28 were reported to be internalized in cells following heating.
In addition, recently, temperature-responsive biopolymer elastin-like
polypeptide-modified liposomes have been reported to show an induced
cellular uptake following dehydration of the molecules on the liposomal
surface.29 As dehydration of the polymer
increases its interaction with the cell membrane, PNIPAAm-copolymer-modified
liposomes are expected to contribute to the enhancement of both the
cellular uptake of the liposomes and the release of their content
in the cells following heating.

In this study, we synthesized
poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-co-N,N′-dimethylaminopropylacrylamide
(P(NIPAAm-co-DMAPAAm)) (molar ratio, 95/5; molecular
weight, 5500)–1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-ethanolamine
(l-α-phosphatidylethanolamine dioleoyl; DOPE) and compared
the physicochemical properties of the DOPE-conjugated, P(NIPAAm-co-DMAPAAm)-modified N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)
propyl]-N,N,N-trimethyl-ammonium
methylsulfate (DOTAP)/DOPE liposomes as temperature-responsive liposomes
to those of hydrated PEGylated liposomes to develop intracellular
drug carriers. Here, we showed that the tunable surface properties
of the temperature-responsive polymer-modified liposomes enabled their
heat-activated dehydration, which induced faster cellular uptake and
release.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 LCST
of P(NIPAAm-co-DMAPAAm)
The NIPAAm and DMAPAAm
in the P(NIPAAm-co-DMAPAAm)
acted as the temperature-responsive and hydrophilic moieties, respectively.
In aqueous solution, PNIPAAm exhibits an expanded coil conformation
below the LCST because it is strongly hydrated; however, it changes
to a globular form above the LCST because of its sudden dehydration.30 It was reported that the coil–globule
transition of PNIPAAm could be detected using differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC).

The temperature-responsive transition of
the P(NIPAAm-co-DMAPAAm) suspension in water was
examined using DSC and transmittance measurement. The DSC curve showed
a large and sharp endotherm centered at 40.5 °C (Figure 1a), whereas the transmittance
curve with 50% transmittance was observed at 40.2 °C (Figure 1b). These results
indicate that the copolymer chains efficiently transitioned sharply
from a hydrophilic to a hydrophobic state at approximately 40 °C.
Therefore, the copolymer LCST was determined to be approximately 40
°C, which is above the normal body temperature.

using (a) DSC and (b) transmittance measurement.

2.2 Colloidal Stability and Carboxyfluorescein
(CF) Release from Polymer-Modified Liposomes
We prepared
temperature-responsive and PEGylated liposomes composed of DOTAP,
DOPE, and P(NIPAAm-co-DMAPAAm) or PEG–distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine
(DSPE) (molar ratio, 30/65/5) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).
The DOTAP/DOPE (molar ratio, 3:7) liposomes prepared as the control
were unstable because of the high DOPE content; thus, they could not
be evaluated.31 Therefore, we prepared
DOTAP/DOPE (molar ratio, 1:1) liposomes as a nonmodified liposome.
It is noteworthy that the modification of the P(NIPAAm-co-DMAPAAm)–DOPE or PEG–DSPE with the unstable DOTAP/DOPE
(3:7) liposomes successfully produced stable liposomes. The stability
was achieved because the PEG–lipid in the liposomal membrane
prevented DOPE–liposome aggregation and the subsequent phase
transition.32,33 This finding suggests that the
temperature-responsive liposomes had hydrophilic layers at their surface
similar to those of the PEGylated liposomes. The physicochemical properties
of the temperature-responsive liposomes, such as colloidal stability
and release of content with increasing temperature, were examined.

The colloidal stability of the liposomes was evaluated by measuring
the particle size of the suspensions (Figure 2). At room temperature, the particle sizes
of the temperature-responsive, PEGylated, and nonmodified liposomes
(25 °C) were 125 ± 0.3, 145 ± 0.7, and 118.2 ±
0.2 nm (mean ± standard deviation (SD)), respectively. When the
temperature was increased, the particle size of the temperature-responsive
liposomes did not increase until 39 °C, indicating that they
were stable at physiological temperatures. However, above the LCST
(40 °C), the particle size of the suspension increased markedly,
indicating that the liposomes lost their colloidal stability and formed
an aggregate. On the other hand, the PEGylated and nonmodified liposomes
were stable throughout the tested temperature region.

Figure 2 Change in the particle
size of liposome suspension in PBS with
increasing temperature: nonmodified (triangle), PEGylated (circle),
and poly-N-Isopropylacryamide-co-N,N′-dimethylaminopropylacrylamide
[P(NIPAAm-co-DMAPAAm)] modified (square) liposomes.

The CF released from CF-entrapped
temperature-responsive liposomes
was measured after incubation at different temperatures (Figure 3). The PEGylated
(Figure 3a) and nonmodified
(Figure 3c) liposomes
retained their CF content tightly throughout their exposure to the
tested temperature region. The temperature-responsive liposomes also
retained the CF content tightly below 37 °C and released approximately
15% in 30 min at 37 °C (Figure 3b,d). Then, the CF release increased markedly at temperatures
>39 °C, near the LCST, and at 42 °C, which was above
the
LCST, the liposomes released approximately 80% of the CF in 30 min
(Figure 3d). The initiation
temperatures of the aggregation and CF release of the temperature-responsive
liposomes in PBS were slightly lower than those of the copolymer LCST
measured in water.

Figure 3 CF release (%) in suspension of (a) PEGylated liposomes,
(b) P(NIPAAm-co-DMAPAAm)-modified liposomes, (c)
nonmodified liposome
in PBS from 0 to 60 min at each temperature, and (d) P(NIPAAm-co-DMAPAAm)-modified liposomes incubated at each temperature
for 5 and 30 min (squares and circles, respectively) (mean ±
SD (n = 3)).

The destabilization by aggregation and the content release
of the
temperature-responsive liposomes were induced by the temperature-dependent
characteristic change of the copolymer. Below the LCST, similar to
the PEGylate liposomes, the hydrated copolymer chains may sufficiently
cover the liposome surface and, thereby, increase the stability of
the unstable DOTAP/DOPE (3:7) liposomes.32 However, above the LCST, the dehydrated copolymer chains may be
distributed partly at the liposomal surface and, therefore, may not
cover the entire liposome, which would greatly decrease the stability
of the liposomes. In this case, the copolymer LCST appeared to tune
the temperature of the liposomes, causing them to aggregate and release
their content.

2.3 Change in the Fixed Aqueous
Layer Thickness
(FALT) of Temperature-Responsive Polymer-Modified Liposomes
To investigate the surface properties of the liposomes, we measured
the zeta potential of polymer-modified liposomes as the surface potential
at different temperatures (Table 1). All of the liposomes exhibited a positive zeta potential,
resulting from the DOTAP. However, the temperature-responsive liposomes
showed a lower zeta potential than the nonmodified and PEGylated liposomes.
With increasing temperature, the temperature-responsive liposomes
showed a markedly increased zeta potential, whereas the nonmodified
and PEGylated liposomes did not show a similar behavior over the tested
temperature range (Table 1).

Table 1 Zeta (ζ) Potential of Polymer-Modified
and Nonmodified Liposomes in Watera
ζ potential (mV)	30 °C	37 °C	45 °C	
nonmodified liposome	61.7 ± 0.3	64.4 ± 0.4	62.4 ± 2.9	
PEGylated liposome	53.5 ± 4.7	54.1 ± 4.3	61.0 ± 2.2	
P(NIPAAm-co-DMAPAAm)-modified liposome	28.2 ± 0.4	38.7 ± 0.3	47.9 ± 1.3	
a Mean ± SD, n = 3.

The zeta potential values decreased when the NaCl
concentration
was increased. The
calculated FALT values are shown in Figure 4; it was low (0.17 nm) for the nonmodified
liposomes, whereas it was high (approximately 4.4 nm) for the PEGylated
liposomes and not temperature-dependent in this range. The FALT of
the PEGylated liposomes was in agreement with the previously described
value of 3.5 nm.34 The temperature-responsive
liposomes showed a FALT of approximately 3.7 nm at 30 °C, which
was also comparable to that of the PEGylated liposomes; however, at
45 °C, it decreased to 0.3 nm, indicating an increased dehydration
of the liposomal surface. On the basis of the results indicating that
the surface of the liposomes was dehydration above LCST, we propose
that the temperature-responsive liposomes have the potential to enhance
cellular uptake and drug release by temperature control.

the FALT of PEGylated, P(NIPAAm-co-DMAPAAm)-modified,
and nonmodified liposomes.

2.4 Enhanced Cellular Uptake of Temperature-Responsive
Polymer-Modified Liposomes
Here, we examined the cellular
uptake of liposomes after incubation for 30 min using flow cytometry
and fluorescence microscopy. The flow cytometry results revealed that
an incubation of RAW264.7 cells with both the rhodamine-labeled liposomes
increased the fluorescence intensity in a temperature-dependent manner,
indicating an increased cellular association (Figure 5a,b). The cellular association of the rhodamine-labeled
temperature-responsive liposomes was more highly increased in a temperature-dependent
manner than that of the PEGylated liposomes. We calculated the ratio
of the fluorescence intensity of rhodamine-labeled liposomes at 30
°C and compared it to that at 40 °C, which is above body
temperature, for each liposome. The increased ratio of fluorescence
intensity, that is, the association ratio of the temperature-responsive
and PEGylated liposomes was 2.22 and 1.48, respectively (Figure 6). The temperature-responsive
liposomes showed a significantly higher association ratio than the
PEGylated liposomes (p < 0.02). This finding indicates
that the temperature-responsive liposomes showed a faster cellular
association at 40 °C than that at 30 °C compared to that
of the PEGylated liposomes. It is suggested that the easy interaction
of the temperature-independent hydrated PEGylated liposomes with the
cell membrane was hindered even with the cationic surface charge.
On the other hand, the partly dehydrated temperature-responsive liposomes
may exhibit enhanced cellular uptake above the LCST.

and (b) PEGylated liposomes incubated
with RAW264.7 cells for 30 min at 30 °C (blue) and 40 °C
(red), and the untreated cells (black).

Figure 6 Effect of increasing the incubation temperature from 30 to 40 °C
on the cellular association of rhodamine-labeled PEGylated and P(NIPAAm-co-DMAPAAm)-modified liposomes. Rhodamine
fluorescence intensity ratio indicated following incubation of each
liposome at 40/30 °C in Figure 5. Mean ± SD, n = 3; p < 0.02.

Using fluorescence microscopy,
we further confirmed the cellular
uptake of the CF-entrapped liposomes labeled with rhodamine in the
RAW264.7 and HeLa cell lines incubated for 30 min. The initial incubation
of free CF or the mixture of free CF and the control (empty temperature-responsive
liposomes) with the RAW264.7 cells did not induce a green fluorescence
by the CF in the cells. This indicates that the CF alone could not
penetrate the cells at 30 and 40 °C following incubation for
30 min (data not shown).

The PEGylated liposomes incubated with
the RAW264.7 cells at 37
°C (Figure 7a)
and 40 °C (Figure 7g) displayed a punctate fluorescence induced by the CF (green) and
rhodamine (red) and their colocalization (yellow) on the cell surface,
which was greater with the HeLa cells than that with the RAW264.7
cells (Figure 7d).
This indicated an association of the liposomes with the cell surface.
Interestingly, the temperature-responsive liposomes incubated with
both the cells at 30 °C exhibited a low level of punctate fluorescence
of CF in the cells and a strong localization of rhodamine on the cell
surface (Figure 7b,e).
This observation suggests that the liposomes were localized in the
endosomes. At 40 °C, the CF fluorescence spread dramatically
in the cytosol (Figure 7c,f), indicating that the CF was released from the internalized temperature-responsive
liposomes following the increase in temperature. We attributed this
increase in fluorescence to the leakage of CF from the liposomes and
their dilution in the cell interior as described previously.20 In addition, it was surprising to note that
the majority of the liposome-entrapped CF was associated with the
cell surface, confirming that the elevated temperatures used for these
experiments were not detrimental to the cells based on a cell viability
assay (Figure 8). The
nonmodified liposomes showed a significantly decreased cell viability,
whereas the PEGylated and temperature-responsive liposomes did not
show a similar behavior at 37 or 40 °C (Figure 8)

with nonmodified,
PEGylated, and P(NIPAAm-co-DMAPAAm) liposomes at

Microscopy findings of the RAW264.7 cells corresponded well
with
flow cytometry findings, as mentioned above. The observation of CF
release from the temperature-responsive liposomes in the cells indicates
that the cellular uptake rate was enhanced by the dehydration of the
liposomal surface induced by the transition of P(NIPAAm-co-DMAPAAm) with increasing temperature. It is noteworthy that even
the PEGylated liposomes taken up into the cells did not release CF
following heating. Furthermore, the higher association of both the
liposomes with the HeLa cells than with the RAW264.7 cells may be
due to the strong interaction between the cationic liposomes and the
negatively charged cell membrane.

The cellular uptake of the
PNIPAAm-copolymer- and PNIPAAm-chitosan-modified
magnetite nanoparticles27 as well as the
PNIPAAm–PAMPTMA polymer complex with siRNA28 was reported following heating. However, the dehydration-induced
cellular uptake of the PNIPAAm-copolymer-modified liposomes has not
been clearly reported. The difference between the cellular uptakes
of nanoparticles and liposomes may be attributed to the temperature-induced
change in particle size. The self-assembled PNIPAAm-copolymer micellar
and solid nanoparticles covered with the copolymer are hardly or slowly
aggregated by the heat-induced dehydration of copolymer and, therefore,
retain their small particle size, resulting in cellular uptake.24 Moreover, PNIPAAm-copolymer-modified liposomes
exhibited a relatively fast heat-induced aggregation to induce a rapid
drug release and a large particle size, resulting in a lower cellular
uptake than that of the nanoparticles. In this study, our temperature-responsive
liposomes started to aggregate and release CF at the copolymer LCST
and exhibited a low rate of heat-induced aggregation. Furthermore,
this effect maintained their small particle size and reduced the CF
release before their penetration into the cells, contributing to the
higher cellular uptake and release. The hydrated layer of the PNIPAAm
copolymer on the unstable DOPE-rich cationic liposomes conferred a
colloidal stability and a low cytotoxicity on the liposomes, which
were comparable to those of PEG. The heat-induced dehydration of the
liposomes increased their aggregation, destabilization, and release
of content. In the intracellular delivery mediated by dehydration
of the temperature-responsive liposomes, a delicate balance between
the aggregation of liposomes and the release of content might be achieved.
Therefore, considering these factors in designing PNIPAAm copolymers
could increase the intracellular delivery of the modified liposomes.

2.5 Cellular Uptake Mechanism
Next, we
investigated the cellular uptake mechanism of the temperature-responsive
liposomes. The cellular uptake study was performed at 4 °C or
in the presence of various endocytic inhibitors. The HeLa cells were
incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with or without the inhibitors and
then treated with the temperature-responsive liposomes at 4 or 40
°C, above body temperature, for 30 min. We used cells that were
incubated with the liposomes in the absence of inhibitors as the control.
The endocytic inhibitors and concentrations were determined on the
basis of previous studies.35 The inhibitor
concentrations that showed a cell viability ≥80% was selected
for this study. Cytochalasin D, nocodazole, sucrose, and filipin III
are the inhibitors of actin-based transport, microtubular transport,
clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and caveolin-mediated endocytosis pathways,
respectively. The cell internalization of the liposomes was mainly
an energy-dependent process because approximately 65% of the cellular
uptake was significantly blocked at 4 °C (Figure 9). The decrease in the measured liposome
rhodamine fluorescence compared to that of the control indicated the
involvement of specific endocytotic mechanism mediated by the inhibitors
(Figure 9). A statistically
significant inhibition of the uptake of the liposomes was observed
for sucrose (28.5%), which is a clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway
inhibitor (p < 0.05), and nocodazole (35.6%),
which causes microtubule disruption (p < 0.01).
The inhibition of cellular uptake by nocodazole suggests that the
microtubules participate in the uptake of liposomes that are known
to participate in microtubule-dependent transport.36

Figure 9 HeLa cells were pretreated with sucrose, filipin III, nocodazole,
and cytochalasin D at 37 °C for 1 h or incubated at 4 °C
for 1 h. Control was not pretreated. Then, the cellular association
of rhodamine-labeled liposomes and P(NIPAAm-co-DMAPAAm)
liposomes was examined in the pretreated HeLa cells following incubation
at 40 or 4 °C for 30 min. Mean ± SD (n =
3); *p < 0.05 vs control and **p < 0.01 vs control.

Together, these data show that the uptake of the temperature-responsive
liposomes into the HeLa cells was mediated by microtubule-dependent
transport and clathrin-mediated endocytosis rather than caveolin-mediated
endocytosis. Particle size has been reported to determine the route
of cellular entry. However, the size dependence for uptake by caveola-
or clathrin-coated vesicles was found to vary with the nature of the
particles, the cell types studied, or both.37 In this study, temperature-responsive liposomes were enlarged by
aggregation, and their surfaces were dehydrated by heating. Microtubules
may mostly be involved in the uptake of larger particles. Therefore,
these surface-tunable polymer-modified liposomes could have a great
potential as intracellular drug-delivery carriers for products such
as genes. We previously examined temperature-responsive liposomes
as carriers of siRNA and plasmid DNA and observed their effective
intracellular delivery, which will soon be reported in a separate
article. However, further studies are needed to elucidate the cellular
uptake and intracellular trafficking mechanisms involved in these
processes and the contributions of the polymer characteristics of
the liposomes.

3 Conclusions
To improve
the cellular uptake and release of the liposome content,
we synthesized P(NIPAAm-co-DMAPAAm)–DOPE and
investigated its physicochemical properties by using it to modify
DOTAP/DOPE liposomes as temperature-responsive liposomes. Below the
LCST of the copolymer, the temperature-responsive liposomes had similar
hydrated layer thickness to that of the PEGylated liposomes. Furthermore,
the temperature-responsive liposomes were stable and did not release
their liposomal content under the aforementioned condition. Above
the LCST of the copolymer, the temperature-responsive liposomes showed
an increased cellular uptake and released the liposomal content into
the cytosol more than the PEGylated liposomes did, although they exhibited
aggregation and release of liposomal content in response to heating.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report that
the dehydration of temperature-responsive polymer-modified liposomes
induced faster cellular uptake and release than the nonmodified liposomes.
The temperature-triggered tunable surface properties of the temperature-responsive
P(NIPAAm-co-DMAPAAm)-modified liposomes could be
highly applicable to intracellular drug-delivery carriers.

4.2 Synthesis of P(NIPAAm-co-DMAPAAm)

using the DSC-60Plus (Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan). The aluminum
pan was sealed using a tablet press machine, and the heating scan
was carried out from 20 to 60 °C at a scanning rate of 1 °C/min
under dry N2.

4.4 Preparation of Polymer-Modified
Liposomes
The liposomes were prepared with DOTAP, DOPE, and
P(NIPAAm-co-DMAPAAm)–DOPE or PEG–DSPE
(Figure S2), each combined at a fixed molar
ratio
of 30/65/5, when necessary, mixed with rhodamine–DHPE (0.01
mol %) in chloroform solution, and the solution in the flask was subsequently
evaporated. The nonmodified liposomes were prepared with DOTAP and
DOPE (molar ratio, 1:1). The thin lipid and the polymer membrane were
dispersed in 1 mL of 2 mM CF in PBS (pH 7.4) or PBS alone to prepare
the CF-entrapped or empty liposomes, respectively, and sonicated in
a bath sonicator. The liposomes were extruded through a polycarbonate
membrane with a pore diameter of 100 nm. The free lipid, polymer,
and CF were removed using gel permeation chromatography on a SephadexG-25M
column using PBS. The liposomes were kept at 4 °C until analysis.

4.5 Measurements of Particle Size, Zeta Potential,
and FALT of Polymer-Modified Liposomes
The particle size
and zeta potentials of the liposomes were measured using dynamic light
scattering with a Zetasizer Nano-ZS (Malvern Instruments Ltd., Worcestershire,
U.K.) and the electrophoretic light scattering ELSZK-2 KOP apparatus
(Otsuka Electronics Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan), respectively. The liposome
suspension was dispersed in PBS, and the particle size was measured
as the colloidal stability at 25 °C. The temperature-induced
changes in particle size and zeta potential were measured from 30
to 50 °C.

To calculate the FALT of each polymer-modified
liposome, the liposome suspension was dispersed in 9% sucrose solution.
We calculated the FALT using Gouy–Chapman theory.39,40 According to this theory, the zeta potential, ψ (L), calculated as the electrostatic potential at the position of the
slipping plane, L (nm), was expressed as 1  where A is a constant; κ
is the Debye–Hückel parameter, which is equal to √C/0.3 for univalent salts; and C is the
molality of electrolytes. When zeta potentials are measured from the
changing concentration of sodium chloride (NaCl) and plotted against
κ, the slope, L, gives the position of the
slipping plane or FALT in nanometers. On the basis of this theory,
the FALT of each liposome was estimated from 30 to 45 °C.

4.6 Determination of CF Release from Polymer-Modified
Liposomes
The CF-entrapped liposome suspension was added
to PBS in a quartz cell (final CF concentration was 1 μM) at
a given temperature, and the fluorescence intensity of the solution
was monitored using a spectrometer. The excitation and emission wavelengths
were 492 and 518 nm, respectively. As the liposomes released the CF
rapidly at temperatures >40 °C, it was difficult to estimate
the initial intensity of the CF-entrapped liposome suspension. We
considered the fluorescence intensity at 20 °C as the standard
release for the CF release measurement, as previously described.9 Furthermore, the percentage release of CF was
defined as 2  where F, F′0, and F″0 are
the intermediary, initial, and final fluorescence intensities, respectively,
and F″ is the final fluorescence intensity
at each temperature. F″ and F″0 were obtained as the fluorescence intensities
of the liposome suspension after the rupturing of liposomes was induced
by the addition of Triton X-100. The change in CF release from the
liposomes was measured from 30 to 45 °C.

4.7 Cell
Culture
RAW264.7 macrophage
and human epithelioid cervix carcinoma HeLa cells (RIKEN BRC Cell
Bank, Ibaraki, Japan) were cultured as subconfluent monolayers in
a 75 cm2 culture flask with a vent cap using minimum essential
medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 50 units/mL penicillin, and 50 μg/mL
streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified incubator exposed to 5%
CO2. Subconfluent RAW264.7 cells were dissociated using
a cell scraper (30 cm, TPP, Switzerland) and cultured in a flask for
2–3 days. The subconfluent HeLa cells were dissociated using
0.05% w/v trypsin, 0.53 mmol/L ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)·4Na
solution (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan) and cultured
in a flask for 3–4 days.

4.8 Determination
of Cellular Uptake of Polymer-Modified
Liposomes Using Flow Cytometry
To detect the cellular association
of the liposomes, the RAW264.7 cells were seeded in a 60 mm dish at
a density of 5.0 × 105 cells per dish in 5 mL of the
medium. After an overnight incubation, the cells were further incubated
for 30 min with rhodamine-labeled PEGylated liposomes and rhodamine-labeled
temperature-responsive liposomes at 30 or 40 °C in a humidified
atmosphere of 5% CO2. Then, the RAW264.7 cells were washed
twice with PBS, harvested with trypsin/EDTA, resuspended in PBS, and
the cell-associated fluorescence was subsequently detected using a
flow cytometer (BD LSRII, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA).

4.9 Evaluation of Cellular Uptake of Polymer-Modified
Liposomes Using Fluorescence Microscopy
HeLa and RAW264.7
cells (1 × 105 and 2 × 105 cells/dish,
respectively) were grown in 2 mL of medium with 10% FBS. After an
overnight incubation, 50 μL of rhodamine-labeled liposomes entrapped
with CF was added and incubated at 30, 37, or 40 °C for 30 min.
Then, the cells were rinsed thrice with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
at 4 °C for 20 min, rinsed thrice with PBS, and observed using
a fluorescence microscope (BZ-9000; Keyence Corp., Osaka, Japan).

4.10 Cellular Uptake after Treatment with Inhibitors
of Endocytosis
HeLa cells (5.0 × 104 cells/well)
were prepared by plating them on a six-well culture plate 24 h before
each experiment. For the pretreatment, we incubated the cells at 4
°C or with medium containing dissolved cytochalasin D (5 μg/mL),
nocodazole (3 μg/mL), sucrose (69 mg/mL), and filipin III (2
μg/mL) at 37 °C
for 1 h. Subsequently, 30 μL of rhodamine-labeled liposomes
was added to the above medium and further incubated at 40 °C
for 30 min with 10% FBS. After incubation, the cells were washed twice
with PBS, harvested with trypsin/EDTA, resuspended in PBS, and the
cell-associated fluorescence of rhodamine was subsequently detected
using a flow cytometer equipped with a PE filter argon-ion laser.

4.11 Cell Viability Assay
HeLa cells
(5.0 × 103 cells/well) were prepared by plating on
a 96-well culture plate. Each liposome was diluted in 100 μL
of medium supplemented with 10% FBS, and the mixture was applied to
the cells. After 24 h incubation at 37 or 40 °C, 10 μL
of water-soluble tetrazolium-8 (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) was applied
to each well and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The absorbance at
450 nm was measured using a microplate reader (TECAN infinite M-1000;
Tecan Japan Co., Kanagawa, Japan).

4.12 Statistical
Analysis
Student’s
nonpaired t-test was used to compare the normally
distributed values between the groups. Statistical significance was
set at p < 0.02.
