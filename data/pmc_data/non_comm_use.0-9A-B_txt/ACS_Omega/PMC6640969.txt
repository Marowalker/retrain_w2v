The functionalization and subsequent
monolayer doping of InGaAs
substrates using a tin-containing molecule and a compound containing
both silicon and sulfur was investigated. Epitaxial InGaAs layers
were grown on semi-insulating InP wafers and functionalized with both
sulfur and silicon using mercaptopropyltriethoxysilane and with tin
using allyltributylstannane. The functionalized surfaces were characterized
using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The surfaces were capped
and subjected to rapid thermal annealing to cause in-diffusion of
dopant atoms. Dopant diffusion was monitored using secondary ion mass
spectrometry. Raman scattering was utilized to nondestructively determine
the presence of dopant atoms, prior to destructive analysis, by comparison
to a blank undoped sample. Additionally, due to the As-dominant surface
chemistry, the resistance of the functionalized surfaces to oxidation
in ambient conditions over periods of 24 h and 1 week was elucidated
using XPS by monitoring the As 3d core level for the presence of oxide
components.

==== Body
Introduction
InGaAs is a promising
potential future channel material for complementary
metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) applications due to its direct band
gap and high electron mobility.1−6 With device feature sizes perennially decreasing and a move away
from SiO2-based gate dielectric strategies ongoing, new
methods for passivating and doping of InGaAs based materials will
become more important if the material is to become integrated in future
technology nodes. Metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors
(MOSFETs) based on InGaAs will allow continued scaling through a reduction
in operation voltage and device footprints without compromising performance.
Source and drain (S/D) doped III–V MOSFET devices are still
attracting considerable attention. Advanced III–V-based CMOS
processes and technologies require ultrathin body channel materials
to maintain minimal junction and gate leakage and to reduce short
channel effects. S/D regions with increased thickness will also be
required to further reduce access resistances. Si and Sn are typical
dopants of choice for n-type doping of InGaAs. Doping of InGaAs conventionally
takes place either in situ by introducing a dopant-containing gas
during epilayer growth, by ion implantation post growth, or in the
case of a device such as a MOSFET, selective epitaxy on each side
of the gate of in situ doped source/drain materials using the channel
material as a seed layer. Typically, the highest temperature step
for an InGaAs MOSFET fabrication process approaches 550 °C. From
a device fabrication perspective, it is desirable to reduce the thermal
budget as much as possible, whilst maintaining high carrier concentrations.
For this reason, Sn is the preferred n-type dopant at such temperatures,
as active carrier concentrations above 5 × 1019 atoms
cm–3 can potentially be achieved for relatively
low epitaxy thermal parameters.7 However,
Si doping may still be more desirable due to its compatibility with
front-end CMOS processes. More pertinently, the limited diffusivity
of Si in InGaAs would prove beneficial if high-concentration, ultrashallow
junctions are to be realized, especially in the case of nanostructures.

Conformal doping of nanostructures becomes challenging, especially
for three-dimensional structures, as dimensions are scaled down. Established
methods for doping, such as ion implantation, suffer from several
drawbacks at the nanoscale, such as stochastic dopant distributions,
the inability to control the abruptness to within a nanometer, and
most importantly at the nanoscale, beam-induced damage in the case
of devices. Furthermore, ion implant damage in III–V materials
is generally considered difficult to repair, even with prolonged annealing.
Monolayer doping (MLD), a technique to controllably dope semiconductor
surfaces and nanostructures at shallow depths, has been applied successfully
to Si and Ge using a range of functionalization and dopant synthesis
strategies. A typical MLD process combines the rich surface chemistry
of semiconductors8−11 with the self-assembly of dopant-containing molecules on a semiconductor
surface. This surface is then capped, to prevent desorption of the
chemisorbed monolayer, and annealed using a rapid thermal anneal process
to yield shallow, high-concentration dopant profiles. MLD has already
been shown to be a suitable technique for the shallow doping of Si
and Ge devices with complex and nonplanar geometries, allowing fine
control over dopant profiles.12−30

The functionalization of semiconductor surfaces can also enhance
the resistance of these surfaces toward oxidation. Due to the challenging
surface chemistry of InGaAs and other III–V materials, the
application of MLD has been quite limited. There have been reports
of direct bonding to oxide-free III–V surfaces using organic
thiols,31−35 and due to the simplicity of the procedure and availability of suitable
commercial molecules, as well as the excellent oxidation resistance
offered by III–V-thiol chemistry, this was one of the functionalization
approaches used in this study. Solution-phase S doping of InGaAs has
been relatively widely reported due to the simplicity of the procedure.36−39 Ammonium sulfide is often used to remove the native oxides on InGaAs,
but the process conveniently results in a S-terminated surface, allowing
diffusion of S as a monolayer into the InGaAs surface via a rapid
thermal anneal step. Although not a traditional MLD process, due to
the gas-phase nature of the dopant precursor and high-vacuum requirements
of the deposition process, Kong and co-workers recently reported the
Si MLD of InGaAs nanostructures by means of a MOCVD-deposited silane
layer with a thickness of a few monolayers.40 Enabling precision control over dopant profiles in III–V
materials remains a challenge to be overcome if the high carrier mobilities
are to be exploited in highly-scaled device architectures.

In
this article, we report for the first time, the functionalization
of epitaxially grown InGaAs layers, using a typical ambient pressure,
liquid-phase MLD procedure, with a Si- and S-containing thiol and
with a Sn-containing organometallic molecule. The decision to use
a molecule containing both Si and S was taken to not only have the
benefit of two dopant atoms in one molecule but also to take advantage
of well-known III–V-thiol surface chemistry to minimize oxidation
by ambient conditions. Surface chemistry on the functionalized InGaAs
surface was characterized using XPS. The presence of dopants in the
processed samples was nondestructively ascertained by means of Raman
scattering. Dopant diffusion was monitored using secondary ion mass
spectrometry (SIMS) to measure the total chemical concentration of
the dopants. A schematic illustrating the chemical functionalization
process is shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 General schematic for the InGaAs MLD process: (a) an oxide-free
InGaAs surface was functionalized with 3-mercaptotriethoxysilane (MPTES)
or (b) allyltributylstannane (ATBS). (c) The functionalized substrates
were capped with SiO2 and annealed in a rapid thermal anneal
furnace to cause in-diffusion of the dopant atoms to yield (d) doped
InGaAs substrates.

Experimental Section
All reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received,
unless specified. All chemical manipulations were carried out under
strictly inert conditions in an atmosphere of ultrahigh purity argon
from Air Products Inc., in an Innovative Technologies inert-atmosphere
glovebox and on Schlenk apparatus.

XPS Characterization
XPS spectra
were acquired on an
Oxford Applied Research Escabase XPS system equipped with a CLASS
VM 100 mm mean radius hemispherical electron energy analyzer with
a three-channel detector arrangement in an analysis chamber with a
base pressure of 10 × 10–10 mbar. Survey scans
were acquired between 0 and 1400 eV with a step size of 0.7 eV, dwell
time of 0.5 s and pass energy of 100 eV. Core-level scans were acquired
at the applicable binding energy range for each core level, with a
step size of 0.1 eV, dwell time of 0.05 s and pass energy of 20 eV
averaged over 100 scans. To ensure a good signal-to-noise ratio, the
Sn 3d core-level scans were averaged over 200 scans. An Al Kα
X-ray source at 200 W power was used for all scans. Multiplier voltage
was maintained at 2.2 kV for all acquisitions. All spectra were acquired
at a take-off angle of 90° with respect to the analyzer axis
and were charge corrected with respect to the C 1s photoelectric line
by rigidly shifting the binding energy scale to 285 eV. Data were
processed using CasaXPS software, whereby a Shirley background correction
was employed and peaks were fitted to Voigt profiles. To ensure accurate
quantification, atomic sensitivity factors were taken from the data
acquisition software and manually input into the data processing software.

SIMS Profiling
Samples doped with Si and S were analyzed
with a Cs+ primary beam with 7.25 keV acceleration voltage
and 65 nA beam current, rastered over an area of 250 × 250 μm2. 75As–, 30Si–, and 32S– ions were collected
from each sample during sputtering from a central area of approximately
60 μm in diameter. Sn doped samples were analyzed with a O2+ primary beam with 3 keV acceleration voltage
and 200 nA beam current, rastered over an area of 250 × 250 μm2. 120Sn+ and 75As+ secondary ions were collected during sputtering from a central area
of approximately 150 μm in diameter. Ion-implanted standards
for the calibration of the SIMS concentration were prepared for Sn,
Si, and S by implanting 120Sn+ at 180 keV with
a fluence of 1.7 × 1014 ions cm–2, 30Si+ at 50 keV with a fluence of 4 ×
1014 ions cm–2, and 32S+ at 60 keV with a fluence of 4 × 1014 ions
cm–2, respectively. The substrates were held at
room temperature during the implantation process. The ion beams were
oriented by 7° to the normal of the wafer surface to avoid channeling
effects. Although C may have an effect on junction leakage, it was
not studied in this work due to it being only problematic for fabrication
of very lightly-doped InGaAs thin films. The dopant-containing molecules
were chosen as their small size aims to minimize the amount of C on
the surface. Depth calibration was performed by measuring the SIMS
crater depth using a profilometer and by assuming a uniform erosion
rate in the InGaAs layers. Further details on the SIMS analysis and
preparation of the ion-implanted standards are available in the Supporting Information.

Raman Scattering
Raman scattering data were collected
with a Renishaw InVia Raman spectrometer equipped with a 2400 lines/mm
grating using a 514 nm 30 mW argon ion laser. Spectra were collected
using a RenCam CCD camera. The beam was focused onto samples using
either a 20× or a 50× objective lens. The laser power density
was adjusted to ensure that the thin film surfaces did not undergo
sample heating during the full spectral acquisition time. Although
in principle, Raman spectroscopy may be able to provide a measure
of substitutional versus nonsubstitutional atoms, this would require
much more advanced instrumentation, therefore, efforts were focused
on utilizing Raman scattering to nondestructively analyze the samples
for the presence of dopants prior to SIMS analysis.

InGaAs Sample
Fabrication
Epitaxial In0.57Ga0.43As
semiconductor layers with an approximate thickness
of 200 nm were grown on 2 inch semi-insulating InP substrates using
an Aixtron metal–organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) system.
Trimethylindium, trimethylgallium, and arsine were used as the In,
Ga, and As sources, respectively. An AlInAs barrier of approximately
100 nm was grown on the InP substrate prior to epitaxy of InGaAs to
prevent upward diffusion of dopant atoms from the InP substrates during
the rapid thermal anneal step, thus negating the effect of the substrate
on any measurements. This stack structure minimizes defects at this
composition due to nominal lattice matching between each of the layers.
A schematic showing the stack structure is shown in Figure S1.

General Procedure for the Functionalization
of the InGaAs Surface
with 3-Mercaptotriethoxysilane
All glassware was cleaned
scrupulously with Alconox detergent followed by copious rinsing with
water and then cleaned with a piranha wash (CAUTION: this is a strong
oxidizing agent and reacts violently with organic substances), dried
in an oven overnight at 130 °C, and allowed to cool under a stream
of dry Ar on the Schlenk line. InGaAs substrates were cleaved into
1 × 1 cm2 pieces. Samples were prepared for functionalization
using procedures adapted from McGuiness et al.41 Briefly, the InGaAs token was degreased by sonication in
acetone, MeOH, and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) for 15 min in each solvent
and dried in a N2 stream. The substrate was then dipped
in a concentrated ammonium hydroxide solution for 2 min to remove
the native oxides, rinsed in anhydrous IPA, and dried in a N2 stream. The substrate was then immediately placed into a two-necked
round bottom flask under a positive pressure of Ar with one arm connected
to the Schlenk line and the other neck stoppered. In a separate Schlenk
flask, a 25% v/v solution of 3-mercaptotriethoxysilane in anhydrous
IPA was dried and degassed using four freeze–pump–thaw
cycles. The solution was cannulated under a positive pressure of Ar
into the flask containing the oxide-free InGaAs substrate and was
left for 17–24 h at 80 °C. The substrate was then rinsed
using hot IPA to remove physisorbed species and was immediately placed
into an inert atmosphere prior to characterization.

General Procedure
for the Functionalization of the InGaAs Surface
with ATBS
Glassware was cleaned as described previously.
Samples were prepared for functionalization using procedures adapted
from Lie and co-workers.42 InGaAs substrates
were cleaved into 1 × 1 cm2 pieces. The InGaAs token
was degreased by sonication in methanol and acetone for 5 min each
followed by drying in a stream of ultrapure N2. Native
oxide removal was performed in hydrofluoric acid and water. The liquid-phase
HF etching of the InGaAs token took place in an aqueous solution of
HF (49%, Honeywell) and ultrapure water (UPW, Milli-Q, 18 MΩ
cm–1) at a volumetric ratio of 1:50 for 5 min at
room temperature. The sample was rinsed with UPW and dried in an ultrapure
N2 stream. These etching parameters have been reported
to give an As-rich surface containing As–As or As–H
bonds.42 ATBS was dissolved in previously
distilled and dried mesitylene to make up a 25% v/v solution in a
Schlenk flask. This flask was subjected to three freeze–pump–thaw
cycles to remove any dissolved gases. This solution was cannulated
directly under positive pressure of Ar into a flask containing the
InGaAs token. The reaction vessel was heated to 160 °C to maintain
reflux and left for 2 h. The sample was rinsed consecutively in anhydrous
toluene, hexane, ethanol, and a final rinse in toluene to remove any
physisorbed species. All samples were kept under an inert atmosphere
prior to characterization and processing.

Results and Discussion
Modification
of the Oxide-Free InGaAs Surface with 3-Mercaptopropyltriethoxysilane
(MPTES)
Si is one of the most popular dopants for InGaAs,
especially when introduced via ion implantation and in situ growth.
Significantly, Si has a sticking coefficient approaching unity and
very low diffusivity making the doping of InGaAs using Si attractive
for devices that require high doping concentrations and sharp, shallow
doping profiles. However, Si exhibits amphoteric behavior in InGaAs
leading to complications in determining active carrier concentrations
as Si can act as both an n-type and p-type dopant.43 Hence, the concentration of conducting electrons is typically
lower than the number of silicon dopant atoms and it is challenging
to achieve free carrier concentrations in the 1019 range.
XPS characterization was conducted on all samples to determine if
MPTES chemisorbed on the surface of InGaAs, thereby indicating successful
functionalization, and also to investigate whether or not the sample
oxidized during the functionalization process. Each sample was sonicated
in anhydrous ethanol prior to insertion into the UHV atmosphere of
the XPS spectrometer to remove physisorbed species. Figure 2 shows the As 3d core-level
spectra for (a) an as received, cleaved InGaAs wafer, (b) an oxide-free
InGaAs wafer, and (c) an oxide-free InGaAs surface that has been functionalized
with the MPTES molecule. Figure 2a shows primarily a peak at 40 eV, which is indicative
of unoxidized elemental As from InGaAs.44 A shoulder peak chemically shifted to approximately 44 eV is present,
which is representative of oxidized arsenic species.45 Shown in Figure 2b is an XPS spectrum of the same sample analyzed immediately
after an NH4OH etch to remove the native oxides. The spectrum
is dominated solely by the elemental arsenic peak, showing effective
native oxide removal at the surface. Figure 2c shows an XPS spectrum of the same sample
after immersion in a 25% v/v solution of MPTES in IPA for 24 h. The
spectrum exhibits only a peak at 40 eV showing the presence of nonoxidized
As as part of an oxide-free InGaAs surface. This shows that despite
the long substrate immersion times, no oxide had regrown on the surface
postfunctionalization. Figure S2 shows
the survey spectra for the as-received wafers, oxide-free wafers,
and samples that have been functionalized with the MPTES molecule.

Figure 2 XPS spectra
of the As 3d core level depicting the surface chemistry
for: (a) an as-received InGaAs substrate, (b) an InGaAs substrate
freshly etched with ammonium hydroxide, and (c) an InGaAs substrate
functionalized with MPTES. The large oxide component present at 44
eV in (a) disappears after the ammonium hydroxide etch and remains
absent in the functionalized substrate, highlighting that the functionalization
process did not increase the amount of As oxides on the surface.

Figure 3a shows
the combined XPS As 3p, S 2p, and Ga 3s core-level scans of the MPTES-functionalized
substrate. The component at approximately 161 eV can tentatively be
attributed to the presence of S in a thiolate form, which would be
consistent with direct S-substrate bonding of the MPTES molecule.46 Instrumental resolution was limited in the experiments
due to the use of a nonmonochromated X-ray source which precludes
further resolution of this thiolate peak to determine if the bonding
mode is Ga–S or As–S. Nevertheless, the presence of
S on the surface after copious postreaction washing would imply that
the MPTES molecule has successfully bonded covalently to the oxide-free
InGaAs surface. Figure 3b shows the C 1s core-level scan of the MPTES-functionalized surface.
The main component shown in red at 285 eV represents a combination
of adventitiously bound carbon as well as C–C moieties from
the MPTES molecule. The smaller blue component located at approximately
287 eV is indicative of C–O/C–S moieties, which are
also consistent with the structure of the MPTES molecule. Due to overlap
of the S 2p and Ga 3s regions shown in (b), it is nontrivial to compare
the peak intensities to the C 1s peak to elucidate rudimentary film-thickness
measurements. This overlap also makes the estimation of molecular
packing densities extremely difficult. Nonetheless, with copious postreaction
washing of the substrates, all physisorbed material is likely to be
removed leaving only the chemisorbed monolayer. Figure 3c shows the combined scan for the Ga 3p and
Si 2p regions. Again, due to the complex XPS spectra with regard to
peak overlaps and surface plasmons, it is nontrivial to determine
the presence of Si. A shoulder located at approximately 101 eV, attributed
to the Si 2p peak, could tentatively be fitted. Attempts were made
to fit the peak with and without this shoulder. The peak fit remained
better with the shoulder peak present, showing the presence of Si
could cautiously be confirmed. Combined with the data showing the
presence of S, the chemisorption of the MPTES molecule was deemed
successful.

Figure 3 (a) Combined As 3p, S 2p, and Ga 3s core-level XPS spectra showing
the presence of S on the surface with (b) showing the C 1s peak with
C–O/S chemical moieties indicated by the blue peak and (c)
combined Ga 3p and Si 2p core-level scans. A small shoulder peak in
(c), indicated in pink, shows tentative evidence for the presence
of Si on the surface from the MPTES molecule.

Dopant Characterization of InGaAs Surfaces Functionalized with
3-MPTES and Subsequently Capped and Treated with a Rapid Thermal Anneal
Samples functionalized with MPTES were removed from an inert atmosphere
and capped with 50 nm of sputtered SiO2 and heated in a
rapid thermal anneal furnace to 700 and 750 °C for 10 and 20
s under nitrogen. Although the choice of method for the capping layer
deposition and the specific composition of the capping layer may affect
the monolayer integrity, these effects were not studied in this work.
The choice of capping layer can also dictate whether the dopant molecules
diffuse upwards into the capping layer or down into the semiconductor
substrate intended for doping, that is, dopant segregation. Dopant
segregation coefficients are widely known for dopants such as P and
B for doping of Si with SiO2 capping layers. However, to
the best of our knowledge, literature on the segregation coefficients
for S, Si, and Sn for an InGaAs/SiO2 system is scarce,
especially for species diffusing from the semiconductor surface. Plasma-enhanced
chemical vapor deposition, electron-beam evaporation, or spin-coating
could be used to deposit the capping layer to determine the effect,
if any, on the MLD process. Following the anneal step, a buffered-oxide
etch was used to remove the oxide prior to dopant characterization.
Raman scattering was utilized in the first instance to “fingerprint”
the samples nondestructively for the presence of dopants prior to
destructive SIMS analysis. Raman scattering has been used as a noncontact
method to elucidate carrier density, crystallinity, and band-bending
in binary and ternary III–V semiconductors.47,48 Data obtained for MPTES-functionalized samples which were subjected
to a rapid thermal anneal process at different temperatures are shown
in Figure S3. As can be seen from the peak
intensity reduction and shift, when compared to that of a bulk, undoped
sample, the dopant introduction has an effect on the Raman signature
of the InGaAs, suggesting an alteration in the structure. Due to the
bulk nature of the material, no damage caused by the laser beam was
observed on the surface of the sample, showing the change in the Raman
signature is due to dopant incorporation, as opposed to thermal stress
caused by the laser power. A lower laser power of 50% was used as
a precaution. Electrochemical capacitance–voltage measurements
cannot differentiate between S and Si to give active carrier concentration
data. Thus, SIMS was the analysis method of choice for dopant profile
analysis. Figure 4a
displays a SIMS profile showing sulfur concentration versus depth
data for the MPTES-functionalized samples which were subjected to
a capping step and rapid thermal anneal process. The sample annealed
at 700 °C for 10 s exhibited a peak carrier concentration of
approximately 2 × 1020 atoms/cm3 with a
maximum junction depth of approximately 75 nm. Another MPTES sample
functionalized similarly and annealed at 700 °C for a longer
time of 20 s exhibited a similar concentration approaching 2 ×
1020 atoms/cm3 with an approximate increase
of 25 nm in the junction depth to 100 nm. A sample functionalized
with MPTES and then subjected to an anneal at a higher temperature
of 750 °C at 10 s exhibited a slightly higher peak concentration
approaching 4 × 1020 atoms/cm3. Additionally,
the dopant profile at the higher anneal temperature was much deeper,
with a maximum junction depth of 150 nm for the S-MLD process. The
data shown in Figure 4b show Si concentration versus depth data collected simultaneously
with the S data on the same samples as shown in Figure 4a. Due to the differing diffusivity of Si
versus S in InGaAs, Si does not diffuse as well as S. The concentrations
of Si when compared to the concentrations of S were generally an order
of magnitude lower. All three samples exhibited very similar profiles
in terms of peak concentrations at approximately 1 × 1019 atoms/cm3. This unusual phenomenon, whereby the concentration
of Si saturates, has been observed previously and several models exist
to explain the saturation of Si doping in III–V materials.
The low solubility of n-type dopants in InGaAs, such as Si, is a significant
barrier to the creation of low-resistance S/D regions in devices,
in addition to impeding the fabrication of ohmic contacts. This lack
of temperature dependence for Si solubility has been studied in detail
for Si-implanted InGaAs susbstrates,49,50 but further
work will be needed to fully understand the diffusion mechanism from
an MLD perspective, that is, diffusion from the surface.

Figure 4 SIMS profiles
showing: (a) sulfur concentration vs depth and (b)
silicon concentration vs depth data for MPTES-functionalized samples
which were subjected to a capping step and rapid thermal anneal process.
The sample annealed at 700 °C for 10 s exhibited a peak S concentration
of approximately 2 × 1020 atoms/cm3 with
a maximum junction depth of approximately 75 nm. A sample annealed
at 700 °C for a longer time of 20 s exhibited a similar concentration
approaching 3 × 1020 atoms/cm3. A sample
functionalized with MPTES and then subjected to an anneal at a higher
temperature of 750 °C for 10 s exhibited a slightly higher peak
concentration approaching 4 × 1020 atoms/cm3. (b) The sample annealed at 700 °C for 10 s exhibited a peak
Si concentration of approximately 1 × 1019 atoms/cm3 with a maximum junction depth of approximately 50 nm. A sample
annealed at 700 °C for a longer time of 20 s exhibited a similar
concentration approaching 1 × 1019 atoms/cm3 with a similar junction depth of approximately 50 nm. A sample functionalized
with MPTES and then subjected to an anneal at a higher temperature
of 750 °C for 10 s exhibited a very similar profile to the previous
Si profiles, giving a maximum concentration of approximately 1 ×
1019 atoms/cm3 with a relatively shallow junction
depth of approximately 50 nm.

Despite the difficulty in characterizing the Si-doped samples,
we have shown that it is possible to co-dope InGaAs with S and Si
simultaneously using liquid-phase, ambient pressure surface chemistry.
However, the junction depths are quite deep highlighting the need
for more advanced annealing techniques with faster ramp up and ramp
down rates in addition to emerging techniques such as flashlamp and
laser annealing.51−54

Modification of the Oxide-Free InGaAs Surface with ATBS
Sn is a widely used group IV dopant for the preparation of n-type
InGaAs layers, especially in molecular beam epitaxy. Unlike Si and
Ge, Sn does not exhibit amphoteric behavior in InGaAs and will act
as an n-type dopant only. Thus, Sn is the dopant of choice to achieve
heavily n-doped III–V materials. Unfortunately, suitable Sn
precursors for MLD are scarce due to the complex InGaAs surface chemistry.
Following the cleaning and etching procedure developed by Lie et al.,42 an As-dominant surface results, which, following
a DI water rinse, leaves a H-terminated surface that may be reacted
with the labile C=C site on ATBS. The presence of inorganic
fluorides, typically observed by XPS in the F 1s region at approximately
690 eV postclean would indicate an incomplete cleaning process, but
XPS analysis did not show evidence for the formation of such fluorides. Figure 5 shows a Sn 3d core-level
spectrum of an InGaAs surface that has been functionalized with the
ATBS molecule. The spectrum is dominated by the Sn 3d elemental doublet.
The doublet separation is approximately 8.3 eV, which would indicate
oxidation of the monolayer, which is consistent with instability of
the organostannane in air. Samples were prepared to monitor the stability
of the underlying substrate toward reoxidation. The XPS survey spectra
for the as received and cleaned substrates used for the ATBS functionalization
are shown in Figure S4. Attempts were made
to probe the nature of the bond between the ATBS molecule and the
oxide-free InGaAs surface using FTIR. The signal for the As–C
bonding modes was indiscernible from noise during the analysis. The
presence of Sn on the surface via XPS, despite prolonged sonication
in organic solvents postreaction would imply that ATBS is chemisorbed
onto the oxide-free InGaAs surface.

Figure 5 An XPS Sn 3d core-level scan for a sample
functionalized with ATBS.
The spectrum is dominated by a doublet with a peak-to-peak separation
of 8.3 eV. This would suggest the presence of an oxidized Sn species
which may be attributed to the low stability of the organostannane
monolayer on the surface.

Dopant Characterization of InGaAs Surfaces Functionalized with
ATBS and Subsequently Capped and Treated with a Rapid Thermal Anneal
The ABTS-functionalized samples were removed from an inert atmosphere
and capped with 50 nm of sputtered SiO2, and heated in
a rapid thermal anneal furnace for 10 s at 550 and 600 °C under
nitrogen. The ATBS-functionalized and doped InGaAs samples were tested
for the presence of Sn by using Raman scattering before SIMS analysis.
Data obtained during Raman scattering are shown in Figure S5. The Raman spectra show a dampening in the intensity
of the GaAs-like longitudinal optical mode when compared to those
of the bulk, nominally undoped sample. The insets more clearly show
the reduction of the GaAs-like and InAs-like longitudinal optical
peak. This reduction is due to the creation of charge carrier density
as a result of the doping, which causes a decrease of the surface
depletion layer. Due to the bulk nature of the material, no damage
was observed on the surface of the sample, suggesting that the change
in the Raman signature was due to dopant incorporation, as opposed
to thermal stress caused by the laser power. As a precaution, a lower
laser power of 50% (6 mW) was used. Figure 6 displays a SIMS profile showing concentration
versus depth data for the ATBS-functionalized samples, which were
subjected to a capping step and rapid thermal anneal process. A significant
surface peak was present in both samples with a steep exponential
tail. This peak may be attributed to a large amount of Sn located
at, or very close to, the surface of the samples within the resolution
of the SIMS technique, which is around 5 nm. Samples were sonicated
for prolonged periods of time postreaction to ensure all physisorbed
material was removed to minimize this surface peak. The junction depths,
similar to those of the MPTES-doped samples, were quite deep, approaching
100 nm, highlighting the need for more advanced annealing techniques
in order to further optimize the Sn-MLD process.

Figure 6 SIMS profile showing
concentration vs depth data for ATBS-functionalized
samples, which were subjected to a capping step and rapid thermal
anneal process. The sample annealed at 550 °C for 10 s exhibited
a peak carrier concentration of approximately 2.5 × 1020 atoms/cm3. Another ATBS-functionalized sample similarly
treated and annealed at 600 °C exhibited a peak concentration
approaching 1.1 × 1020 atoms/cm3.

Stability of MPTES- and
ATBS-Functionalized InGaAs Samples toward
Reoxidation
The stability that is inferred on semiconductor
surfaces by grafted monolayers is interesting for many applications.
With respect to device integration, regrowth of surface oxides prior
to rapid thermal anneal treatment and other important steps in CMOS
processing is undesirable, especially in the moments immediately after
a processing step. Surface functionalization greatly increases the
oxidation resistance of semiconductor surfaces.55,56 To ascertain the stability of the MPTES- and ATBS-functionalized
samples toward ambient conditions, substrates were left exposed to
ambient conditions (air, 20 °C) for periods of time ranging from
24 h to 1 week. Immediately prior to analysis, the samples were rinsed
with anhydrous chloroform to remove adventitiously adsorbed material
from the surface. The As 3d core-level scan was used to monitor for
an increase in oxide formation. Figure 7 shows an overlay of data acquired after 24 h on an
MPTES-functionalized sample and an ATBS-functionalized sample. The
MPTES-functionalized sample exhibited no evidence of oxide after 24
h. The ATBS-functionalized sample exhibited a presence of oxide near
42 eV after 24 h. The complete acquired stability spectra for the
MPTES-functionalized samples are shown in Figure S6a–c. The As 3d core-level data from nonfunctionalized
InGaAs substrates are shown in Figure S7a–c. The MPTES-functionalized substrates exhibited excellent resistance
toward reoxidation when compared to the nonfunctionalized InGaAs substrates,
especially 24 h immediately after functionalization. This stability
can be attributed to the tight packing of the MPTES molecule. McGuiness
and co-workers also postulated, due to thiol-functionalized III–V
compounds showing no observable oxide, that the thiols pack very densely
to protect the underlying surface.57 Additionally,
McGuinness suggests that removal of remaining substrate oxides after
monolayer formation occurs by a “cleaning” action by
the alkanethiol molecules, perhaps involving exchange of S for O at
the surface and sacrificial reduction of the inorganic oxides by thiols. Figure S8a–c compares the As 3d XPS spectra
for the ATBS-functionalized samples, acquired immediately after preparation
and after exposure to ambient conditions for 24 h and 1 week. These
samples exhibited resistance toward oxidation that was not as strong
as that of the MPTES-functionalized samples. This may be attributed
to the bulky nature of the ATBS molecule where the bulky butyl groups
may not allow for as close packing as that of the MPTES molecule.
This may cause pinhole oxidation at certain sites on the passivated
surface. Efforts were made during the MLD process to ensure strict
exclusion of oxygen and moisture. The ATBS sample was exposed to atmospheric
conditions for as short a time as possible during transport to the
UHV environment of the XPS spectrometer.

Figure 7 Overlay of data acquired
after 24 h from (a) an ATBS-functionalized
sample and (b) an MPTES-functionalized sample. The MPTES-functionalized
sample exhibited no evidence of oxide after 24 h. The ATBS-functionalized
sample exhibited a presence of oxide near 42 eV after 24 h.

Conclusions
The
monolayer doping process has been shown to be a versatile technique
for the conformal doping of a range of bulk and nanostructured materials
such as Si and Ge. However, reports of MLD on III–V materials
are scarce due to the challenging surface chemistry of InGaAs. As
III–V materials come to the fore as prime candidates for future
CMOS devices, there will be a need to conformally dope such materials
whilst ensuring the substrates remain free from oxide ingress. InGaAs
can successfully be functionalized with MPTES, a Si containing alkylthiol,
as well as ATBS, an organostannane, as shown by XPS analysis. The
MPTES-functionalized substrates, in particular, exhibited excellent
resistance toward reoxidation, especially within the first 24 h after
functionalization, which is advantageous for future integration into
CMOS fabrication processes. Raman scattering showed dopant incorporation
into the crystal lattice in the case of both MPTES- and ATBS-functionalized
substrates when compared to that of a bulk undoped sample. Introduction
of Sn via the liquid-phase MLD method proposed in this study could
prove beneficial when compared to traditional methods of dopant introduction.
Implanting of heavier species into InGaAs, such as Te and Sn, is known
to result in amorphization, which needs to be rectified with an anneal
step.58 The Sn-functionalization step outlined
in this study avoids the use of highly-energetic ion beams and the
resultant damage to the semiconductor crystal lattice. Although junction
depths may need to be optimized by using annealing methods with faster
ramp up and ramp down rates or more advanced annealing techniques
such as laser annealing or flashlamp annealing, SIMS measurements
also showed successful dopant diffusion into the substrates with maximum
concentrations and depths varying with temperature. Although diffusion
of dopants into III–V materials is complex, the surface chemistry
developed in this study has potential applications for III–V
nanowire devices in a similar manner to strategies applied to silicon
and germanium nanowires.59 Additionally,
there are no requirements for gas-phase precursors or complex deposition
systems, making this approach suitable and cost-effective for industry.
