The combination of
multiple physiological (swelling, porosity,
mechanical, and biodegradation) and biological (cell/tissue-adhesive,
cell proliferation, and hemostatic) properties on a single hydrogel
has great potential for skin tissue engineering. Adhesive hydrogels
based on polydopamine (PDA) have become the most popular in the biomedical
field; however, integrating multiple properties on a single adhesive
hydrogel remains a challenge. Here, inspired by the chemistry of mussels,
we developed PDA–sodium alginate–polyacrylamide (PDA–SA–PAM)-based
hydrogels with multiple physiological and biological properties for
skin tissue engineering applications. The hydrogels were prepared
by alkali-induced polymerization of DA followed by complexation with
SA in PAM networks. The chemical composition of the hydrogels was
characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. PDA–SA complexed
chains were homogeneously dispersed in the PAM network and exhibited
good elasticity and excellent mechanical properties, such as a compressive
stress of 0.24 MPa at a compression strain of 70% for 0.4PDA–SA–PAM.
The adhesive hydrogel also maintained a highly interconnected porous
structure (∼94% porosity) along with PDA microfibrils. The
hydrogel possesses outstanding swelling and biodegradability properties.
Owing to the presence of the PDA–SA complex in the PAM network,
the hydrogels show good adhesion to various substrates (plastic, skin,
glass, computer screens, and leaves); for example, the adhesive strength
of the 0.4PDA–SA–PAM to porcine skin was 24.5 kPa. The
adhesive component of the PDA–SA chains in the PAM network
significantly improves the cell proliferation, cell attachment, cell
spreading, and functional expression of human skin fibroblasts (CCD-986sk)
and keratinocytes. Moreover, the PDA chains exhibited good hemostatic
properties, resulting in rapid blood coagulation. Considering their
excellent cell affinity, and rapid blood coagulation ability, these
mussel-inspired hydrogels have substantial potential for skin tissue
engineering applications.

==== Body
Introduction
Hydrogels are hydrophilic
interpenetrating polymeric networks (IPNs)
that can absorb and retain large amounts of water.1 They are promising templates for numerous potential applications,
such as drug delivery devices, tissue engineering scaffolds, sensors,
and environmental pollutant filters.2−4 Furthermore, hydrogels
exhibit potential as scaffolding devices for tissue engineering as
they are structurally similar to the extracellular matrix (ECM) components
of native tissues. The greatest challenge in tissue engineering is
designing hydrogels that can adhere to biological tissue without exerting
any toxic effects on the host tissue after implantation.5,6 Tissue-adhesive hydrogels are desirable for tissue engineering applications
because hydrogels can enable hemostasis and adhesion between biological
tissues.5 Moreover, such hydrogels can
improve cell proliferation and attachment to regenerate biological
tissues. The use of polysaccharide-based hydrogels has already demonstrated
their potential for tissue engineering applications.7,8 However, these types of hydrogels exhibit relatively weak adhesion
with biological host tissues after implantation.9 Thus, it is necessary to improve the adhesion of hydrogels
that can enhance proliferation for improved interactions with biological
tissue for regeneration.

Biomimetic approaches can provide an
alternative and efficient
method for synthesizing adhesive hydrogels to mimic nature.10 Mussel-inspired PDA has attracted considerable
interest in biomedical applications because of its biocompatibility,
hemostatic properties, and moderate antibacterial properties.11,12 The structural similarity between polydopamine (PDA) and mussel-secreted
proteins (DOPA) has been proven to result in strong adhesion on various
substrates.13 Considering its strong adhesiveness,
PDA can be used to improve the cell/tissue adhesion of hydrogels in
tissue engineering.14,15 PDA contains phenolic hydroxyl
groups and amino groups, which aid in activating the coagulation system,
preventing infections, and accelerating wound healing.16 In addition, PDA-based adhesive hydrogels have
also been used in electronic skin and biosensor applications.17,18 So far, adhesive hydrogels have been prepared using DA-conjugated
polymers such as hyaluronic acid (HA), SA, and CS by pendant catechol
conjugation on a polymer.19−21 However, the chemical reaction
between DA and the polysaccharides produces relatively few pendant
catechol groups on the polymer, which generally results in poor mechanical
properties for these hydrogels. The incorporation of PDA networks
in the poly(acrylamide) (PAM) hydrogels further exhibited good cell
adhesive and wound healing properties compared to other hydrogels.22−24

The combination of multiple biological and physiological properties
is desirable in skin tissue engineering. Cell/tissue-adhesive and
hemostatic biological properties are of primary importance for skin
tissue engineering.25 In addition, physiological
properties such as swelling, porosity, mechanical, and biodegradation
further enhance skin regeneration, particularly wounded skin. Inspired
by the mussel chemistry of PDA, herein, we developed cell-adhesive
and hemostatic hydrogels composed of PDA–SA–PAM for
tissue engineering applications. SA is a natural linear polysaccharide
extracted from seaweed composed of homopolymer blocks of (1,4) crosslinked
β-d-mannuronate and α-l-guluronate and
widely used in well-studied alginate gels for tissue engineering applications.26 The introduction of appropriate cell adhesion
polymers into SA-based three-dimensional (3D) hydrogels enables the
regulation of specific interactions between cells and hydrogels, making
the hydrogel more biologically suitable for the host response. Considering
the cell/tissue-adhesive and hemostatic properties of PDA, we homogeneously
dispersed PDA–SA in a covalently crosslinked PAM network to
enhance its physicochemical and biological properties, rendering this
hydrogel suitable for skin tissue engineering applications. The swelling
behavior and biodegradability of the PDA–SA–PAM hydrogels
were studied, and cell attachment and hemostasis were also examined
in vitro on these hydrogels. Unlike previously reported PDA-based
adhesive hydrogels, the developed hydrogels show multiple physiological
and biological properties for potential skin tissue engineering applications.22,23

Results and Discussion
Preparation of PDA–SA–PAM Hydrogels
In
this work, mussel-inspired PDA–SA–PAM hydrogels were
prepared, and the cell adhesion, antibacterial, and hemostatic properties
were evaluated for possible applications in tissue engineering (Scheme 1). The hydrogels
were prepared via a two-step process. In the first step, the PDA–SA
complex was prepared by alkali-induced polymerization of DA in a SA
polymer solution (Supporting Information Figure S1). The as-formed PDA–SA complex was confirmed by Fourier-transform
infrared (FTIR), UV–vis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) (Supporting Information Figure S2). In the second step, the as-prepared PDA–SA complex was
homogeneously dispersed in a covalently crosslinked PAM hydrogel via
redox-initiated free radical polymerization using N,N′-MBA as a crosslinker. In this study,
ammonium persulfate (APS) was used as an initiator for the formation
of hydrogels. However, APS is the toxic reagent and easily soluble
in water compared to other initiators. Hence, APS can be easily removed
from hydrogels after immersing hydrogels in DDW. The hydrogel formulations
are summarized in Table S1. With the functional
groups (catechol, amino, and carboxyl) of the PDA mimicking the mussel
adhesion interactions, the 0.4PDA–SA–PAM hydrogels exhibited
good adhesion to a wide range of surfaces. As shown in Figure 1, the 0.4PDA–SA–PAM
hydrogels adhered to human skin (a), glass (b), a computer screen
(c), and a leaf (d). The hydrogels also easily molded to a finger
(e). Moreover, the hydrogels were transparent (c). The 0.4PDA–SA–PAM
hydrogel adhered to human skin (author’s hand) without causing
any irritation, damage, or pain (Supporting Information Figure S3). As demonstrated in Supporting Information Figure S4, the 0.4PDA–SA–PAM hydrogel
tightly adhered to merged plastic tubes (a and b) and supported a
load of 72 g. The hydrogels also displayed a highly stretchable nature
(Supporting Information Figure S4c,d).
Furthermore, to elucidate the adhesion performance of the 0.4PDA–SA–PAM
hydrogels, a macroscopic peeling test was performed on human skin
(author’s hand). As shown in Supporting Information Figure S4e,f, a stripping lag was observed during
the peeling process. Moreover, the hydrogels could not be immediately
removed from the skin surface. Porcine skin was used as model tissue
to determine the hydrogel strength of adhesion to porcine skin using
a tensile adhesion test. As shown in Figure 1f, the PDA content influenced the adhesion
strength of the hydrogels. The hydrogel strength of adhesion to the
porcine skin was obtained as 7.8, 14.5, and 24.5 kPa for the SA–PAM,
0.2PDA–SA–PAM, and 0.4PDA–SA–PAM hydrogels,
respectively. The hydrogel strength of adhesion to porcine skin was
strongly dependent on the PDA content. The maximum adhesion strength
of the 0.4PDA–SA–PAM hydrogels led to an increased viscosity
in the hydrogels, and the polymer chain can easily be diffused into
the porcine skin tissue surface with a stronger connection.22 Moreover, the free catechol groups in PDA interact
with amine or thiol groups on the skin tissue surface to form cation
π or π–π interactions, thereby improving
the adhesion strength compared to polysaccharide-based hydrogels (Figure 1g).

Tissue Engineering Applications
Characterization
The functional groups and their interactions
of hydrogels (SA–PAM and 0.4PDA–SA–PAM) were
measured from deconvoluted high-resolution XPS spectra for carbon
(C 1s) and nitrogen (N 1s) (Figure 2). Figure 2a shows the C 1s XPS spectrum for the SA–PAM hydrogels.
The C 1s peaks of the SA–PAM hydrogels can be deconvoluted
into three major peaks at 284.1, 284.7, and 285.7 eV, which are assigned
to the C–C, C–O, and C–N or C–OH of the
SA–PAM hydrogels. Additionally, the peaks at 287.4 and 288.7
eV are ascribed to H-bonded O=C of amide (O=C–NH2) and COO–, respectively. Two major peaks
were observed in the N 1s spectrum of the SA–PAM hydrogels
at 399.1 and 400.2 eV (Figure 2b), which are attributed to N 1s in the MBA (crosslinking
agent) and H-bonded amide (−CO–NH2) in the
PAM, respectively. The C 1s XPS spectrum for the 0.4PDA–SA–PAM
hydrogel displayed similar peaks with lower binding energies at 285.6,
287.2, and 288.3 eV due to hydrogen-bonded C–N or C–OH,
amide groups (−CO–NH2), and −COO– groups, respectively (Figure 2c). Additionally, a new peak at 286.4 eV
was detected for 0.4PDA–SA–PAM due to the presence of
aromatic C–OH/C–N groups in PDA. The N 1s spectrum of
0.4PDA–SA–PAM exhibited peaks at 399.1 and 400.1 eV,
which were attributed to the contribution of N atoms in MBA and PAM,
respectively (Figure 2d). The additional peak at 401.1 eV was attributed to the N atoms
in the PDA. Hence, the XPS spectra proved the existence of functional
groups of PDA in the hydrogel.

Rheology and Compressive
Analysis
In general, PAM-based
IPN-structured hydrogels are robust and capable of withstanding highly
compressive stress without breakage.27 In
the present study, the PDA–SA–PAM adhesive hydrogels
appeared to be stretchable and robust. Moreover, the SA–PAM
and 0.4PDA–SA–PAM hydrogels can rapidly return to the
original shape after the application of a compression force (Supporting
Information Figure S5). Figure 3a,b shows that the compressive
stress of the SA–PAM hydrogels can reach a strength of 0.3353
MPa and a stiffness of 2479 N/m at a 70% compressive strain. Once
the incorporation of PDA into hydrogels, both compressive strength
and stiffness were decreased to 0.21 and 0.18 MPa and 1957 and 1393
N/m for 0.2PDA–SA–PAM and 0.4PDA–SA–PAM,
respectively. The decrease in compressive strength and stiffness of
the hydrogels is attributed to the increased viscosity of the hydrogels.
However, the 0.4PDA–SA–PAM hydrogel displayed a compressive
strength of 0.18 MPa and a stiffness of 1393 N/m at a strain of 70%
with excellent stretching ability and the ability to rapidly return
to its original position (Supporting Information Figure S5), which is a significant improvement compared with
PAM, PDA-PAM, and other adhesive hydrogels.19−22

The solid-like elastic response of the hydrogels
with and without
PDA was evaluated via frequency-dependent rheology of the storage
modulus (G″) and loss factor (tan δ
= G″/G′), as shown
in Figure 3c,d. In
this study, the SA–PAM-based hydrogels exhibited a low, stable
loss factor, suggesting that the hydrogels have good elastic recovery
properties. A similar conclusion has been reported for PAM and PAM
polysaccharide-based IPN-structured hydrogels.28 It is interesting to note that the 0.4PDA–SA–PAM
hydrogel also exhibited a low, stable loss factor (tan δ),
indicating the good elastic recovery of hydrogels.

Microstructure
of Hydrogels
The microstructure and
morphological features of the hydrogels were analyzed by scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) after water was removed by freeze-drying
(Figure 4). The average
pore sizes of SA–PAM, 0.2PDA–SA–PAM, and 0.4PDA–SA–PAM
were calculated to be 77.4 ± 12.0, 102.0 ± 9.8, and 159.7
± 7.4 μm, respectively (Figure 4g). A highly interconnected porous structure
with large average pore sizes was observed on the adhesive hydrogels
(0.4PDA–SA–PAM, Figure 4c) because the PDA functional groups (catechol) can
bind with water molecules in a regular structure, which is consistent
with the measured compressive strength and G′
results. Hence, the adhesive hydrogels have great potential for tissue
engineering because these interconnected porous structures enable
cell recruitment to facilitate the permeation of nutrients and oxygen.
Moreover, the pure SA–PAM hydrogel had a smooth surface, whereas
the 0.2PDA–SA–PAM and 0.4PDA–SA–PAM hydrogels
exhibited microfibril structures (the arrow indicates the formation
of PDA microfibrils on the hydrogel surface). The high-resolution
field emission SEM (FE-SEM) images of SA–PAM hydrogels show
a smooth surface (Figure 4d), whereas 0.2PDA–SA–PAM and 0.4PDA–SA–PAM
hydrogels had fibrous topology with microfibrils (Figure 4e,f). Microfibrils formed in
the PDA incorporated SA–PAM hydrogel because of the complexation
of PDA and SA, which is homogeneously dispersed in the PAM network
through π–π interactions and hydrogen bonds.22,28 The scaffolds should have a porosity of at least 90% to provide
a large surface area for cell–polymer interactions and to yield
sufficient space for ECM regeneration during in vitro culture.29 The porosity was observed to increase with the
increasing PDA content in the hydrogels, at 89.2% (SA–PAM),
92.6% (0.2PDA–SA–PAM), and 94.0% (0.4PDA–SA–PAM),
respectively (Figure 4h). Overall, the microstructure results confirm that the developed
PDA-based hydrogels have great potential for tissue engineering.

Swelling and Biodegradation
The water retention capacity
of porous hydrogels is important for cell growth to ensure that the
nutrient medium can easily penetrate the hydrogels. Thus, we explored
the effect of SA and PDA–SA on hydrolytic swelling and degradation
within the PAM networks in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4)
at 37 °C (Figure 5a). The hydrogels are highly porous with interconnected network structures.
During the swelling process, the pores inside the network rapidly
fill with PBS solvent; at the same time, the polymer segments (PAM,
PDA, and SA) take up PBS, the content of which depends on the attractive
force between the PBS and the polymer chains. As expected, the PDA–SA–PAM
hydrogels swelled significantly more than the SA–PAM hydrogels,
most likely due to both the solvation of the hydrophilic segments
(SA and PDA) and pore filling by the PBS solvent, since the hydrogels
have high porosity. Moreover, among all samples, the 0.4PDA–SA–PAM
hydrogel exhibited the highest swelling capacity because of its larger
pore size, which is important for cell growth in tissue engineering.

(%) and (b) degradation weight loss (%) of hydrogels

Biodegradable hydrogels
play an important role in tissue engineering
applications. Ideally, the degradation rate should match the tissue
regeneration rate. Biodegradable hydrogels can achieve this via polymer
backbone degradation (e.g., hydrolysis, enzymatic cleavage). For this
purpose, in vitro degradation of the hydrogels was investigated by
monitoring the percent weight loss during incubation in PBS (pH 7.4)
at 37 °C (Figure 5b). The percent weight loss of the hydrogels at different time points
is shown in Figure 5b. In particular, the degradation trend obtained for the hydrogels
was SA–PAM > 0.2PDA–SA–PAM > 0.4PDA–SA–PAM
following a 21-day incubation with a weight loss of 22.7, 21.8, and
20.5%, respectively. In general, the PAM hydrogels exhibited the lowest
degradability compared with the polysaccharide combination. The blend
components used in this study (SA, PDA, and PAM) are essentially a
combination of biodegradable (SA) and nonbiodegradable polymers (PDA
and PAM). The SA plays an important role in improving the swelling
and degradation properties; thus, the PDA–SA combination is
more advantageous for improving the mechanical and biodegradation
properties.

Cell Proliferation, Viability, and Attachment
PDA is
an adhesive material that can better facilitate cell attachment compared
with other polysaccharides and synthetic polymers.19−22,28 The combination of PDA with the SA–PAM hydrogel is expected
to facilitate cell attachment compared with the SA–PAM hydrogel
alone. An 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT) assay was performed to evaluate the proliferation of SFs and
KTs seeded on hydrogels for 3 and 7 days (Figure 6a,b). An increase in cell proliferation (cell
number) for the SFs and KTs was observed at 3 and 7 days for both
the 0.2PDA–SA–PAM and 0.4PDA–SA–PAM hydrogels
compared with the SA–PAM hydrogel and tissue culture polystyrene
(TCPS) as two-dimensional cell culture conditions. The proliferation
capacity of both cell types (SFs and KTs) on the hydrogels was greatly
improved for the hydrogels containing PDA. Overall, the adhesive hydrogels
show a high cell proliferation capacity for both SF and KT cells compared
with SA–PAM and TCPS (p < 0.05). Furthermore,
the viability and morphology of cells (SFs and KTs) on the hydrogels
(SA–PAM, 0.2PDA–SA–PAM, and 0.4PDA–SA–PAM)
was evaluated via a live/dead assay using fluorescence microscopy
(Figure 6c). The cells
in the PDA–SA–PAM hydrogels exhibited significantly
greater attachment compared with the SA–PAM hydrogels and TCPS
with no dead cells observed at day 7. Hence, PDA can play an important
role in improving cell attachment and proliferation due to good adhesion
between the cells and the hydrogel. Overall, in vitro evaluation of
the hydrogels demonstrates that the PDA-containing hydrogels are cytocompatible
and promote cell proliferation and adhesion with cell spreading in
the 3D environment. This evidence is supported by the recent work
of Cima et al., who described the effect of adhesive PDA on cell proliferation
and attachment.29 Furthermore, the adhesion
of SF and KT cell lines to the hydrogels (SA–PAM and PDA–SA–PAM)
was analyzed by SEM after 3 and 7 days of culture (Figure 7). SEM images showed that cells
(SFs and KTs) attached more firmly to the SA–PAM hydrogels
compared with the PDA–SA–PAM hydrogel. This result may
be due to the adhesive component of PDA–SA. Indeed, the 0.4PDA–SA–PAM
scaffold had a higher number of adherent cells (SFs and KTs) on the
scaffold surface compared with the SA–PAM hydrogel, confirming
that the PDA–SA-PAM hydrogel not only facilitates cell attachment
but also cell spreading.

different culture conditions (3 and 7 days).

Hemostasis Performance
The blood clotting time was
obtained by evaluating the in vitro blood clotting potential of hydrogels
treated with porcine whole blood. Figure 8a shows the blood clotting time after porcine
whole blood was applied to the hydrogels (SA–PAM, 0.2PDA–SA–PAM,
and 0.4PDA–SA–PAM). The blood clotting time was found
to be 360 s for porcine whole blood alone, similar to blood clotting
time of human whole blood reported elsewhere.30 The blood clotting time for porcine whole blood was found to be
the same (360 s) on the SA–PAM hydrogel. However, the blood
clotting time was 180 s for the 0.4PDA–SA–PAM hydrogel,
which is much shorter than the times for 0.2PDA–SA–PAM
(240 s) and SA–PAM (360 s) and blood alone (360 s). The decreased
blood clotting time for the PDA-containing hydrogel is due to the
hemostatic ability of PDA.

hydrogels.

Furthermore, the hemocompatibility
of the developed hydrogels was
evaluated by performing a hemolysis assay (Figure 8b,c). Photographs were acquired of vials
containing SA–PAM, 0.2PDA–SA–PAM, 0.4PDA–SA–PAM,
Triton-X, and saline treated with red blood cells (RBCs) after centrifugation
(Figure 8b). The photographs
show a clear supernatant for the sample of saline-treated RBCs, revealing
the hemocompatibility of the hydrogels. In contrast, the Triton-X
sample was not clear because of the release of hemoglobin from the
RBCs. Furthermore, the percent of hemolysis was found to be less than
5% (the allowable limit for hydrogels) for the 0.2PDA–SA–PAM
and 0.4PDA–SA–PAM hydrogels while that of the SA–PAM
hydrogels was 5.5%, suggesting that high hemocompatibility is achieved
when PDA is incorporated into the hydrogels (Figure 8c).

Platelet adhesion is a crucial
indicator of thrombosis. To investigate
the effect of PDA content on platelet adhesion to the hydrogels, we
studied platelet adhesion by SEM (Figure 8). The SEM images showed low platelet adhesion
to SA–PAM (Figure 8d); however, very high platelet adhesion was observed on the
0.2PDA–SA–PAM and 0.4PDA–SA–PAM hydrogels
(Figure 8e,f). In general,
the fibrous topography of collagen and other nanofibrous scaffolds
results in high platelet adhesion; thus, a nanofibrous topography
may play an important role in platelet adhesion.31 In this study, the microfibrils formed in the hydrogel
networks gave rise to a fibrous topology as observed in the hydrogel
microstructure. Therefore, the platelets could sense and respond to
the 0.2PDA–SA–PAM and 0.4PDA–SA–PAM hydrogels.
The platelet adhesion was poor in the SA–PAM hydrogel due to
its smooth surface microstructure. Thus, PDA may play an important
role in facilitating platelet adhesion and accelerating blood clot
formation.

Conclusions
In summary, adhesive,
highly elastic hydrogels were prepared using
a combination of PDA–SA–PAM for tissue engineering applications.
Overall, the adhesive component of PDA–SA possesses high hydrophilicity,
and its molecules can produce viscous solutions, which have a significant
impact on the characteristics of PDA–SA–PAM-based hydrogels,
including the morphology, cell adhesion, swelling behavior, degradation,
mechanical properties, and hemostasis. Hence, the desirable pore structure,
formation of adhesive microfibrils, good mechanical properties, outstanding
swelling properties, controllable degradation, hemocompatibility,
blood clotting ability, and favorable biocompatibility render these
hydrogels promising materials for skin tissue engineering. Continuing
with this basic platform, future studies will focus on in vivo evaluations
to confirm the potential of these hydrogels for skin tissue engineering
applications.

Experimental Section
Materials
DA, N,N′-MBA, and tetramethylenediamine
(TEMED) were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich. AM and ammonium persulfate (APS) were purchased from
Dae-Jung Chemical and Metal Co., Ltd., South Korea. All chemicals
were used as received.

Preparation of PDA–SA–PAM Hydrogels
PDA–SA–PAM
hydrogels were prepared by alkali-induced polymerization of DA in
SA solution followed by free radical polymerization of AM monomers
using N,N′-MBA as a crosslinker.
Typically, the DA monomer was polymerized in 2% SA solution at pH
10 for 30 min under open-air atmosphere. Subsequently, AM (2.0 g),
MBA (0.075 g), and APS (0.2 g) were added to the PDA–SA solution
in an ice-water bath. Finally, TEMED (20 μL) was added. The
reaction mixture was removed from the ice-water bath and allowed to
polymerize at room temperature. After formation, the hydrogels were
placed in a beaker containing distilled water for 3 days to remove
unreacted monomer (AM), crosslinker (N,N′-MBA), and initiator (APS). Finally, the hydrogels were freeze-dried
at −80 °C for 3 days. The hydrogels were prepared at different
DA/AM ratios (0.2 and 0.4) and without PDA as summarized in Supporting
Information Table S1.

Characterization
The structural and functional groups
of the SA and PDA–SA complex were evaluated using Fourier-transform
infrared (FTIR) spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer). The spectral data
were recorded in the transmission mode over the range of 4000–500
cm–1 using 16 scans at a resolution of 4 cm–1. UV–visible spectra of the SA and PDA–SA
complex were acquired using a UV–visible spectrophotometer
(HITACHI U-2010) scanning between 200 and 500 nm. The rheological
behavior of the hydrogels was assessed under a frequency mode range
of 0.1–100 1/s using an Anton Paar rheometer (Physica MCR301;
Austria) with a parallel-plate geometry at 25 °C. The mechanical
properties of the hydrogels were investigated in the compression mode
using a dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA) (Q800, TA instruments, South
Korea) with a 0.05 N preload force at 25 °C and a rate of 3.0
N/min. Prior to analysis, the samples were immersed in PBS solution
and then cut into circular disks with a diameter of 10 mm and a height
of 10 mm. The structural composition and functional group interactions
of the hydrogels were analyzed by XPS using ESCALAB 250 with an Al
Kα X-ray monochromatic source (hν = 1486.6
eV) and a spot size of 200 μm. The microstructure of the hydrogels
(SA–PAM and PDA–SA–PAM) was analyzed by SEM using
Hitachi S-4800.

Porosity
To evaluate the porosity,
a known weight of
freeze-dried hydrogels (SA–PAM, 0.2PDA–SA–PAM,
and 0.4PDA–SA–PAM) (M1)
was placed in a bottle filled with absolute ethanol, which was later
degassed by supersonic treatment to infiltrate the hydrogel with ethanol.32 Then, the hydrogels were removed, the excess
surface ethanol was wiped with filter paper, and then the hydrogels
were immediately weighed (M2). The following
equation was applied to calculate the porosity of the hydrogels (N = 3 for each time point).  where ρ is the density of the absolute
ethanol and V is the volume of the hydrogel.

Swelling
and Biodegradation
Before the physical properties
of the hydrogels were evaluated, the dry weight (Wd) of the hydrogels (10 mm diameter) was measured. Then,
the samples were immersed in PBS solution (10 mL) and incubated at
37 °C, and the PBS was replaced every week. At predetermined
time intervals (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 21 days), the hydrogel samples
were removed, and the swollen hydrogel sample weights were measured
(Ws). The percent swelling ratio (% SR)
of the hydrogels was calculated by the following equation (N = 3 for each time point).  After the swollen
hydrogel samples were weighed,
the samples were washed with water, lyophilized, and then weighed
(Wf) again. The biodegradation of the
hydrogel samples was measured as the percent mass loss of the hydrogel
samples, calculated by the following equation (N =
3 for each time point).  

Strength of Hydrogel Adhesion
to Porcine Skin
The adhesion
strength of the SA–PAM, 0.2PDA–SA–PAM, and 0.4PDA–SA–PAM
hydrogels to porcine skin was measured using a tensile test (Instron
5567). The hydrogels were applied to the specimen surface with a bonding
area of 25 × 20 mm2. The strength of adhesion was
measured as the maximum load divided by the bonded area.

Cell Studies
(Cell Proliferation, Viability, and Attachment)
Human skin
fibroblasts (CCD-986sk) (SFs) and keratinocytes KTs
(American Type Cell Culture Collection (ATCC)) were cultured in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum and 1% penicillin–streptomycin solution. The cells
were maintained in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °Chironomus prior to the cell studies, the samples were
sterilized in 70% ethanol for 3 h, repeatedly washed with PBS, and
finally incubated overnight in DMEM solution.

The proliferation
of SF and KT cells on the hydrogels (SA–PAM, 0.2PDA–SA–PAM,
and 0.4PDA–SA–PAM) was assessed using the MTT assay.
Briefly, SF and KT cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 104 cells/cm2 onto 24-well plates containing hydrogels,
which were incubated in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO2 at 37 °C) for 3 and 7 days. Then, 200 μL of MTT dye solution
(5 mg/mL PBS solution) was added to each well, followed by incubation
in a humidified atmosphere for 4 h. After the medium was removed,
the scaffolds containing dye were dissolved by the addition of acidic
isopropanol solution and incubated for 30 min in the dark at room
temperature. From each well, the resulting solution was transferred
to a 24-well plate, and the optical density of the converted dye was
screened at 570 nm using a microplate reader. The cell proliferation
(cell number) was calculated based on a calibration curve that was
constructed from different cell densities.

Furthermore, the
effect of the hydrogels on cell viability and
their cytotoxicity (SA–PAM, 0.2PDA–SA–PAM, and
0.4PDA–SA–PAM) were examined using a live/dead assay
kit (Life Technology). Briefly, cells were grown at a density of 5
× 104 cells in a scaffold placed in a 24-well plate
and were placed in a humidified incubator (5% CO2 at 37
°C) for 7 days. The culture medium was changed every other day.
Then, the culture medium was replaced with 600 μL/well from
a mixture of 10 mL of PBS containing 20 μL of ethidium homodimer-1
(red dye for the detection of dead cells) and 2 μL of calcein
AM (white dye for the detection for live cells), followed by incubation
for 30 min. The scaffolds containing cells were visualized by fluorescence
microscopy (Nikon Eclipse Ti, Italy).

The adhesion of SFs and
KTs to the hydrogels (SA–PAM, 0.2PDA–SA–PAM,
and 0.4PDA–SA–PAM) was also assessed. The cells (5 ×
104) were seeded onto the surface of the hydrogels, which
were fitted in 12-well plates and were incubated in a humidified atmosphere
for 3 or 7 days. TCPS was used for comparison of 3D cell culture with
hydrogels. After incubation, the medium was removed, and the hydrogels
were washed with PBS. Then, the cells were fixed by applying 4% formaldehyde
solution for 10 min. Finally, the samples were washed again with PBS,
followed by dehydration with an ethanol–water mixture (30,
50, 70, and 100%). The morphology of the adherent cells on the hydrogels
was observed by FE-SEM (SEM, Hitachi S-4800).

In Vitro Hemostasis
Porcine whole blood was kindly
received from the Lotte Foods Co., Ltd. slaughterhouse, to which sodium
citrate was added (3 mg/mL blood). The hydrogel samples (SA–PAM,
0.2PDA–SA–PAM, and 0.4PDA–SA–PAM) were
placed in 42-well plates. Then, 300 μL of recalcified porcine
whole blood was added to each well containing a hydrogel sample.33 Wells without hydrogels were used as a control.
At specific points in time, the hydrogel samples containing wells
treated with saline solution were used to remove the remaining nonclotted
blood. The blood clotting time was recorded for the formation of stable
clots after the wells were washed with saline.

Hemolysis Assay and Platelet
Adhesion
Porcine whole
blood with sodium citrate solution (3.8%) was centrifuged to separate
red blood cells (RBCs) and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) for a hemolysis
assay and to evaluate platelet adhesion to the hydrogel samples.33,34 To evaluate the hemocompatibility of the hydrogels, 500 μL
of diluted RBCs (1 mL of RBCs with 9 mL of saline) was added to 100
mg of SA–PAM, 0.2PDA–SA–PAM, and 0.4PDA–SA–PAM
hydrogels in separate vials. In addition, 100 μL of 0.1% Triton-X
and 100 μL of saline were used as positive and negative controls,
respectively. The vials were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and then
centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 10 min. The obtained supernatant was analyzed
to determine the optical density using a microplate reader at 540
nm. The percentage of hemolysis was determined using the following
equation (N = 3 for each time point).  Before the platelet adhesion test, the hydrogel
samples were immersed in PBS solution for 3 h and then placed in 24-well
plates. A PRP suspension was added to the samples, which were then
incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, the hydrogels were
washed twice with PBS and immersed in 1% glutaraldehyde solution for
2 h to fix platelets on the hydrogels. Then, the hydrogels were again
washed with PBS and dehydrated in gradient ethanol solutions (30,
50, 70, and 100%). Finally, the morphology of the adherent platelets
was examined by FE-SEM (SEM, Hitachi S-4800).

Statistical Analysis
The data are given as the mean
± standard deviation. Statistical differences were analyzed using
a one-way analysis of variance, and a value of p <
0.05 was determined to be statistically significant.
