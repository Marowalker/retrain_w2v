A naked-eye
colorimetric chemosensor DK based on benzothiazole
could recognize CN– effectively. When DK interacted with CN– in the aqueous solution, the
obvious color change of the solution was directly observed by the
naked eye. Other anions did not cause any interference. It is interesting
that DK could also discriminate Ni2+ from
other cations, and the possible interaction mode between them was
verified based on the Job’s plot, 1H nuclear magnetic
resonance titration, infrared , electrospray ionization mass spectrometry,
scanning electron microscopy analysis, and density functional theory
calculation methods. As a result, it is clear that the mode of action
between DK and CN– was different from
that between DK and Ni2+. Meanwhile, the limit
of detection of DK toward CN– and Ni2+ was calculated to be 1.7 × 10–8 or
7.4 × 10–9 M, respectively. In addition, CN– was recognized qualitatively by a test paper and silica
gel plates made from DK. DK was able to
detect CN– in tap water quantitatively, rapidly,
and on-site by the use of a smartphone APP. All results implied that DK has certain prospects for practical application to identify
CN– in water.

==== Body
Introduction
It is universally known
that cyanide anion (CN–) is one of the most toxic
anions1,2 because it
can cause many of the body’s physiological functions to be
disordered including hypoxia, respiratory failure, endocrine disorders,
nervous system lesion, vascular necrosis, and even death.3−7 Despite its daunting toxicity, CN– plays an important
role in industry and life.8−10 Because of its widespread industrial
applications and serious dangers to the environment and humans, it
is highly desirable to develop some convenient, reliable, inexpensive,
highly sensitive, good selective, rapid, and effective methods to
detect CN– in water.11−13

As everyone knows,
nickel ion (Ni2+) participates in
some vital life processes such as biosynthesis, biological respiration,
and metabolism.14,15 However, the excessive accumulation
of Ni2+ in body can also cause adverse effects on the respiratory
system, blood, kidneys, and other body organs, which might lead to
certain diseases including allergies, asthma, pneumonia, cancer, and
nervous system diseases.14−18 Besides, Ni2+ is applied widely in the industry.16−19 Hence, there is much attention to seek better test methods for Ni2+.14−19

Compared to other methods, chemosensors have gained more and
more
attention because of their excellent superiorities.20−23It is found that chemosensors
toward Ni2+ have been seldom reported, which may be related
to the interference caused by some basic metal ions.24−26 In addition, there are a few chemosensors which can recognize both
anions and cations independently.27−29 Although some chemosensors
can recognize certain cations and anions, they cannot independently
interact with cations or anions. They interact with cations or anions
through the “sequential detection” mechanism.27−29 At present, it is rare to find some colorimetric chemosensor that
can discriminate CN– or Ni2+ from other
ions independently.

Herein, it is reported that the chemosensor DK which
was synthesized and separated easily could recognize CN– effectively (Scheme 1). Once DK interacted with CN–, the
distinct color changes of the solution were perceived by the naked
eye. Interestingly, DK could also detect Ni2+ with good selectivity and high sensitivity even in the presence
of other cations. The action mode between DK and CN– (or Ni2+) was confirmed based on the Job’s
plot, 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) titration, infrared
(IR), electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) analysis, and density functional theory
(DFT) calculation methods. From the data, it is obvious that DK could interact with CN– or Ni2+ through two different kinds of mechanisms. Besides, the limit of
detection (LOD) of DK toward CN– or
Ni2+ was calculated to be 1.7 × 10–8 and 7.4 × 10–9 M, which was much lower than
the standards in the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines and
in some chemosensors previously reported.7,30 Furthermore,
the test paper and silica gel plates made from DK could
achieve the purpose of qualitative detection of CN– in the tap water. DK could implement the quantitative
detection of CN– rapidly and on-site by the use
of a smartphone APP. All results implied that DK has
certain prospects for practical application to identify CN– in water.

Scheme 1 Synthetic Route of DK
Results and Discussion
Colorimetric Analysis of DK with
CN–
When various anions F–, Cl–, Br–, I–, SO42–, SO32–, S2–, NO3–, NO2–, PO43–, CO32–, HCO3–,
AcO–, EDTA2–, H2PO4–,
and CN– were added into the DK solution,
only CN– caused the absorption spectra change, and
a new absorption peak appeared at 408 nm. The solution color changed
from colorless to yellow immediately, which was observed directly
by the naked eye (Figures 1 and 3a). It is interesting that no
other cation except Ni2+ could cause a red shift in the
absorption spectra when different metal ions (K+, Na+, Ag+, Cu2+, Co2+, Ca2+, Cd2+, Mg2+, Ba2+, Pb2+, Sr2+, Fe2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Mn2+, Hg2+, Al3+, Y3+, Ce3+, and Fe3+) were added to the DK solution. It is clear that the absorption peak at 335 nm
decreased in the absorption spectra, and a new absorption peak rose
at 399 nm simultaneously (Figure 2). The color change of the solution was examined forthright
by the naked eye from colorless to pale yellow after Ni2+ was added (Figure 3b).

× 10–5 M) with various anions (3 equiv) in

In order to study the detection of DK toward CN– and Ni2+ in the presence
of other ions,
an interference experiment was carried out. The results showed that
other ions had no effect on the detection of DK toward
CN– and Ni2+ (Figures S4 and S5, Supporting Information). It implied that DK could recognize CN– and Ni2+ independently, selectively, and sensitively and hence might be considered
as the colorimetric chemosensor toward CN– and Ni2+.

Interaction Mode
To find out the
interaction mode between
CN– or Ni2+ and DK, the
Job’s plot, 1H NMR titration, IR, ESI-MS, and SEM
were employed. Through the continuous variation method, the stoichiometric
ratio between CN– or Ni2+ and DK was established. From the Job’s plot, it is evident that
the ratio between CN– and DK was 1:1,
whereas the ratio between Ni2+ and DK was
1:2 (Figures S6 and S7, Supporting Information). The consequences were consistent with the molar ratio method (Figures
S8 and S9, Supporting Information). It
is important that the stoichiometric ratio between them was also supported
by ESI-MS. In ESI-MS, a new peak emerged at m/z 269.0493 after CN– was added into the DK solution, which was assigned to [DK–CN– + H+] (calculated for C13H9N4OS, 269.0492, Figure S10, Supporting Information). When Ni2+ was added into
the solution of DK, a new peak also emerged at m/z 699.0129 attributed to [DK + 2Ni2+ + 2NO3– + H+]+ (calculated for C24H19N8NiO8S2, 699.0115, Figure S11, Supporting Information). The above data approved
of the stoichiometric ratio between them.

To understand the
binding sites between them further, 1H NMR titrations were
performed in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-d6 (Figure S12, Supporting Information).
It is apparent from the 1H NMR spectrum that the −NH–
signal (Ha) at 12.20 ppm completely disappeared. At the
same time, the −N=CH– signal (Hb)
at 8.02 ppm reduced slowly and moved to the upfield by degrees. Because
the addition reaction happened between DK and CN–, a new signal (Hc) appeared at 5.58 ppm,
which was assigned to–CH–CN (Scheme 2).30−32 According to Figure S12b (Supporting Information), it is found that the
signal assigned to–NH– (Ha′) at 12.20 ppm decreased, which
indicated that DK was involved in binding with Ni2+ by the hydrogen atom in–NH– (Scheme 2). It is interesting that the
binding sites based on 1H NMR titrations were also backed
up by IR.

Scheme 2 Proposed Sensing Mechanism: (a) DK for
CN–; (b) DK for Ni2+
From the IR spectra, it is distinct that the
stretching vibration
band of −NH (3414.77 cm–1) disappeared with
the addition of CN– (Figure S13, Supporting Information), where two new stretching vibration
peaks appearing at 2962.04 and 2865.89 cm–1 correspond
to the saturated hydrocarbon.32 At the
same time, a new stretching vibration peak at 2144.39 cm–1appears, which was assigned to the −CN group.33 Once Ni2+ was added (Figure S14, Supporting Information), the stretching vibration
band of −NH shifted from 3414.77 to 3404.17 cm–1, and a new stretching vibration absorption peak appeared at 1382
cm–1, which was assigned to NO3–. Hence, it is concluded that the addition reaction of DK with CN– happened in the ratio of 1:1 (Scheme 2), and DK could complex with Ni2+ through the hydrogen atom in–NH–
in the ratio of 2:1 (Scheme 2).

In addition, the aggregation state of DK was researched
by the use of SEM. After CN– was added, the DK aggregation changed evidently from “branch
shape” aggregation to “coral” structure (Figure 4a,b), and the DK aggregate changed to “block stone” when Ni2+ was added (Figure 4c).

Figure 4 SEM image of (a) DK; (b) DK–CN–; (c) DK–Ni2+.

Besides, the LODs of DK toward CN– and Ni2+ were calculated to be 1.7 × 10–8 and 7.4 × 10–9 M on the basis of 3σ/s, respectively (Figures S15 and S16, Supporting Information), which were both much lower than the
standards in the WHO guidelines and in some chemosensors reported
previously (Table S1, Supporting Information).7,34

Theory Computations
To compare the
change of the energy
gap before or after DK interacted with CN– or Ni2+, DFT calculations were performed. According to Figure 5, it is definite
that the electron density was spread on the whole skeleton of DK and DK–CN– in the
highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), and the electron density
in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) was located within
the −N=N– and −CN moiety after the addition
reaction between DK and CN–. It exhibited
that the energy gap (ΔE) between the HOMO and
LUMO changed from 4.0307 eV for DK to 3.6787 eV for DK–CN.33 Besides, it was
distinct that the electron density in the LUMO was mainly distributed
between DK and Ni2+, where ΔE was reduced to 3.0460 eV. The results also maintained
the interaction mode between DK and CN– or Ni2+ (Scheme 2).

Figure 5 DFT calculations: (a) DK; (b) DK–CN–; (c) DK–Ni2+.

Practical Application
In order to
investigate the practical
application, test paper and silica gel plates were made from chemosensor DK. The test paper was spliced into the “Taiji diagram,”
where the two halves of the “Yin” and “Yang”
changed from colorless to yellow when the test paper was dipped in
the solution of CN– or Ni2+ separately.
Additionally, silica gel plates where DK was loaded displayed
the image of “CN–” or “Ni2+” when “CN–” or “Ni2+” was written on a silica gel plate (Figure 6). It hinted that the chemosensor DK showed certain application prospects in identifying CN– and Ni2+ qualitatively based on the test
paper and silica gel plates.

Figure 6 Color changes of DK–based
test paper after
addition of CN– and Ni2+ solutions. Photos
of the silica gel plates loaded with DK were utilized
to sense CN– and Ni2+ in aqueous solutions.

Because of its high toxicity, the manufacturing
process of the
test paper was changed a little to check CN– in
tap water. The test paper was dried in air at room temperature after
they were obtained by dipping a filter paper in 1.0 × 10–3 M solution of DK in N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic
acid (HEPES) buffer/CH3CN (0.01 M, pH = 7.3, v/v = 1:9)
solution for 24 h. Then, the dried test paper was immersed in 50 mL
of distilled water, the solutions of CN– (1 ×
10–3 M) in tap water, and tap water for 5 s separately.
When they were took out, it was found that only CN– induced the color change of the test paper, which was immediately
observed by the naked eye (Figure S17, Supporting Information). The other test papers did not show significant
color change (Figure S17, Supporting Information).

In order to realize the quantitative detection of CN– in water rapidly and on-site, the widespread use of
smartphones
has caught our attention.35,36 Based on the good naked-eye
recognition properties of DK toward CN–, color assist (a mobile APP) has been used to determine the color
changes in the RGB (red, green, blue) values of DK solutions.
As displayed in Figure 7a, the R/B (red/blue) ratios for DK were plotted against
the different concentrations of CN–, and the curve
revealed good linearity ranges (R2 = 0.95545).
To verify the accuracy of the method, the tap water contaminated with
CN– was tested quantitatively by a smartphone and
an ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectrophotometer separately.
As a result, the R/B value of the contaminated tap water obtained
by the smartphone was 1.27, and the concentration of CN– was 20.55 μM according to the corresponding curve (Figure 7a). The concentration
of CN– obtained by the spectroscopic instrument
was 22.54 μM (Figure 7b). To our surprise, the concentration error between the two
methods was only 8.83%. It implied that DK could detect
CN– in water quantitatively, rapidly, and on-site.
All data indicated that DK could provide low-cost, convenient,
and on-the-spot approaches for qualitative and quantitative detection
of CN– in water using a test paper and a smartphone
APP.

CN–. (b) Spectrophotometer for the determination

Conclusions
It is clear that DK could detect
CN– effectively. No other anions have any effect
on the detection of DK toward CN–.
When DK identified
CN– from other anions, the color changes of the
solution were detected directly by the naked eye immediately. It is
interesting that DK could also discriminate Ni2+ from other cations. The LOD of DK toward CN– and Ni2+ was calculated to be 1.7 × 10–8 or 7.4×10–9 M, respectively. The mode of
action between DK and CN– was different
from that between DK and Ni2+, which was confirmed
by the Job’s plot, 1H NMR titration, IR, ESI-MS,
SEM analysis, and DFT calculation methods. Moreover, the goal of qualitative
and quantitative detection of CN– in tap water was
achieved by a test paper and a smartphone APP. All results implied
that DK might have certain prospects for practical application
to identify CN– in water.

Experimental Section
Materials
and Instrumentation
UV–vis spectra
was obtained on a Shimadzu UV-1601 spectrophotometer. NMR spectra
were recorded on a Bruker-AV-500 NMR, spectrometer, and the chemical
shifts are expressed in δ ppm. Mass spectra were measured by
an Agilent 6210 ESI/TOF MS instrument. SEM measurements were obtained
on a Carl Zeiss Sigma 500 microscope. IR spectroscopy was performed
on a Digilab FTS-3000 Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrophotometer.
All spectroscopy were carried out in HEPES buffer/CH3CN
(0.01 M, pH = 7.3, v/v = 1:9) solution, with different equivalent
anions (F–, Cl–, Br–, I–, SO42–, SO32–, S2–, NO3–, NO2–, PO43–, CO32–, HCO3–, AcO–, EDTA, H2PO4–, and CN–) or
metal ions (K+, Na+, Ag+, Cu2+, Co2+, Ca2+, Cd2+, Mg2+, Ba2+, Pb2+, Sr2+, Fe2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Mn2+, Hg2+, Al3+, Y3+, Ce3+, and Fe3+) added into DK while keeping the chemosensor DK concentration constant (1.0 × 10–5 M) in all experiments. Tetrabutyl ammonium salt was used for CN–. The solutions of other anions were prepared from
their sodium or potassium salts. Solutions of metal ions were prepared
from their nitrates. The detection limits for ions were determined
by titrations, and it was calculated on the basis of 3σ/s method. All chemicals used for the synthesis were procured
from commercial suppliers, and all solvents were used without further
purification. Analysis of the orbital distributions of the LUMO and
HOMO energies were calculated by DFT/B3LYP.

NMR Titration Procedure
DK (15 mg) was
dissolved in DMSO-d6 (0.5 mL), and then
a series of different equivalents of CN– (0, 0.3,
0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 equiv.) and Ni2+ (0, 0.15, 0.25, 0.5,
and 0.75 equiv) were added into the solution of DK, and
their 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker-AV-400 NMR
spectrometer.

Study of FTIR Spectroscopy
The solid
powders of DK, DK–CN–, and DK–Ni2+ were prepared. All samples
were
mixed well evenly with KBr to create a compact pellet for the FTIR
detection.

SEM Images
Samples of DK, DK–CN–, and DK–Ni2+ were dissolved in CH3CN. They
were left to evaporate
and dry at room temperature. A SEM sample was fabricated by spreading
the solid powder on a conductive plastic. Then, gold powder was sprayed
on the sample after the detection system was vacuumized. Then, the
surface was imaged using the SEM technique.

Test Paper and Silica Gel
Plate Preparation
The test
paper and silica gel plate were immersed into the solution of DK (1 × 10–4 M), and then it was dried
at room temperature. The solution of CN– and Ni2+ was added on the test paper. The words were written on the
silica gel plates using a brush dipped in a solution of CN– and Ni2+ separately.

Synthesis of DK
2-Hydrazineylbenzo[d]thiazole (165.21
mg, 1.0 mmol) and furan-2-carbaldehyde
(96.09 mg, 1.0 mmol) were dissolved in 25 mL of ethanol (Scheme 1). The solution was
refluxed for 12 h with stirring. When the mixture was cooled to room
temperature, the precipitate was formed. The precipitate was recrystallized
in alcohol and washed by alcohol and water. The product DK was collected and dried under vacuum. Yield 78%, 1H NMR
